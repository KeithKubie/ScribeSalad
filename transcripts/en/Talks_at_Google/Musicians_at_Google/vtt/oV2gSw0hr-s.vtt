BRADLEY HOROWITZ:
Hello, and welcome

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:09.760
to this Talks at Google event.

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:11.030
My name is Bradley Horowitz.

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:13.730
I'm Vice President of
Streams, Photos, and Sharing

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:14.630
here at Google.

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:17.330
It's my pleasure to welcome
you all for this very

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:19.810
special afternoon together.

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:23.130
How many of you got to
attend yesterday's event?

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:23.870
Oh, good.

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:25.870
It looks like about half.

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:28.050
We had a tremendous
amount of fun.

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.150
We had four
world-class musicians

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.070
sitting up here
talking, jamming,

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:35.550
talking about their
craft, laughing.

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:36.110
I laughed.

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.690
I cried.

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.220
It was beautiful.

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:40.860
And more today.

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.890
Today we're going to
have a conversation

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:48.130
between two old friends,
Arturo Bejar Philip Glass.

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:51.490
And Arturo I've known
for quite a long time.

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:53.970
He's a bit of a Silicon
Valley institution.

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:57.270
And in fact, yesterday I learned
that it was Steve Wozniak who

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.560
actually brought Arturo
from Mexico to Silicon

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:02.750
Valley for the first time.

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:07.960
He later went on to found a team
called the Paranoids at Yahoo,

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.500
which was the first
of its kind, really,

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.060
in the Valley that really
focused on issues of spam

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.070
and abuse, and he
carried forward that work

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.690
to Facebook, where he
was at for many years,

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:21.840
building the product
infrastructure team there

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.400
and then working on
issues of compassion

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.680
and bullying and making that
a safe and comfortable place

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:29.920
for all of its users.

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.610
He's since moved
on from Facebook

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.260
and is now focusing on being
a father and a photographer,

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.610
and one of the subjects
of his photography

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:40.170
is, in fact, Philip Glass.

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.870
Philip Glass is a world
renowned composer and pianist

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:44.780
whose work spans generations.

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:49.490
He has composed over the last
25 years more than 20 operas,

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:52.120
8 symphonies, two
piano concertos,

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.210
and numerous
soundtracks to films

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.710
and all the while maintains
his extensive solo creations

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:00.100
on piano and organ.

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.080
He grew up in Baltimore,
studied at Juilliard,

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.040
moved to Europe, where he
trained with Nadia Boulanger

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:09.720
and closely worked with
sitar composer Ravi Shankar.

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.370
When he returned to
the States in the 60s,

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.150
he formed the Philip
Glass Ensemble

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.610
and still performs with
that group to date.

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.950
At almost 80, he's collaborated
with folks from Paul Simon

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.920
to Yo-Yo Ma and presents and
performs solo keyboard concerts

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.200
around the world.

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.080
In 2011, he founded the
Philip Glass Center,

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.720
a home for artists, scientists,
and conservationists

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.790
to collaborate and produce
a culture of renewal

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.500
for our time.

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.830
So I want to invite
these two friends up here

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:42.730
to have a conversation and
maybe even a bit of performance.

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:44.340
Philip, Arturo, welcome.

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:45.340
ARTURO BEJAR: Thank you.

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:46.715
PHILIP GLASS:
Thank you, Bradley.

00:02:46.715 --> 00:02:47.633
Thank you.

00:02:47.633 --> 00:02:48.966
ARTURO BEJAR: Thank you so much.

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:57.920
So I wanted to start,
maybe, a little bit

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.470
seeing how I ended
up here next to you.

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:08.120
When I was in college, the
weirdest thing I had ever heard

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:09.000
came on the radio.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.090
It was "Knee Play Number 5."

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:13.920
And I couldn't leave there.

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.890
I needed to go to
school, and I couldn't

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:19.710
leave to go to school because
I had to listen to it.

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:22.360
And then I listened
to "Einstein"

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:25.080
for God knows how many times.

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:28.170
And fast-forward
20 something years.

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:31.520
And I mean, there is a little
place called Carmel Valley

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:35.110
that's near Carmel-by-the-Sea,
and I go into the video store,

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:36.650
and there's a flyer
there that says,

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:39.849
Philip Glass presents the
Days and Nights Festival.

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:41.390
And I pick it up,
and I'm like, well,

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:44.221
it can't be that Philip Glass.

00:03:44.221 --> 00:03:47.840
Is there another Philip
Glass that's doing this?

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:50.120
And I went to the
first festival,

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:53.590
and I sat down to
watch this dance piece,

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:57.920
and right behind me,
he was sitting there.

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:00.670
And during the break, I
went up and said hello,

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:05.210
and he was very kind with
attention and conversation.

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:09.300
And ever since then, I have been
photographing for the festival,

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:11.050
and in the process
of doing that,

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:16.290
I have seen a collaboration
that is extraordinary

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:21.070
because it spans from young
people-- like, from 20 to 80--

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:26.530
from Africa to Japan, across
cultures, across disciplines.

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:31.920
And being able to be a part of
that has been an amazing gift.

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:33.750
And so what we'll hope
to talk about today

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:37.040
is a lot about that
process and collaboration.

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:39.560
And I wanted to start off by
asking you about your journey,

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:41.630
how you ended up in Big Sur.

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:45.875
PHILIP GLASS: I was just
thinking about that.

00:04:45.875 --> 00:04:49.022
The festival we
have at the-- it's

00:04:49.022 --> 00:04:53.090
the last week of September,
Big Sur this year,

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:55.620
at the Henry Miller Library.

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:04.410
It seems to be-- it was
a destination which--

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:07.910
I didn't know what it
was, but it became that.

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:13.890
When I was just beginning
writing music-- and then

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:16.600
shortly after that I
went study at Juilliard--

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:19.270
I would spend my time
practicing the piano

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:23.400
and working like everybody
else, and I felt so

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:26.200
cut off from everybody
because that's all we did.

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:27.210
And not just me.

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:28.730
Everybody did that.

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:32.350
And I thought, well, if
this is going to be my life,

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:36.010
to be this isolated, this is
not going to happen for me.

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:38.120
So I began
immediately-- I was 19

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:41.120
at the time-- I began
working with dancers

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:42.770
who were the same age as me.

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:45.560
And that's always a
good idea for anybody

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:47.170
who wants to know,
where do you start?

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:51.140
You start with people your
age, and with luck, they

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:52.750
stick around for a while.

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:58.160
And I began working with
theater companies, with dancers,

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:00.520
and I began
immediately-- I wanted

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:03.630
to get out of the
practice room, and I also

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:05.490
wanted to be able to perform.

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:09.690
And I found that dancers
always knew the music.

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:11.840
Theaters often needed music.

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:17.330
And so I didn't have
to create a concert

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:18.360
career at the beginning.

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:21.070
I just started playing
music with other people,

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:22.090
and that just continued.

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:25.080
And then the other thing
that was really interesting

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:31.730
was I was concerned very
much that the music that I

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:34.040
was doing-- I
guess you could say

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:38.340
it was modernistic
music of a certain kind.

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:42.330
But I felt that I wanted
to see, how does that

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:46.110
fit into the world that I live
in, into the everyday world?

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:51.500
And I began to think of
all of the social issues,

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:59.030
political issues, and by
the time I was in my 30s,

00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:02.660
I was writing
operas about people

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:04.960
who changed the world
through their ideas,

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:08.630
like a opera about Gandhi,
an opera about Einstein.

00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:13.860
I began using music and
theater music particularly

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:17.800
as a way of addressing
the issues of life,

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:20.700
of what we are living.

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:25.670
I didn't really want an abstract
music, and though in many ways

00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:29.200
you can hear it as abstract,
music has that quality.

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:30.970
It always has the
quality of-- it

00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:33.010
is emotional and abstract
at the same time.

00:07:33.010 --> 00:07:34.280
So we'll always have that.

00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:40.110
But I wanted to connect the
music with the power of ideas.

00:07:40.110 --> 00:07:42.970
So I got involved
with scientists.

00:07:42.970 --> 00:07:49.560
The other thing when I was a
kid-- so I was born in '37.

00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:53.760
So by 1945, '46 people
began knowing who Einstein

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:55.870
was because of the atomic bomb.

00:07:55.870 --> 00:07:59.530
But suddenly, this scientist
became-- he was actually

00:07:59.530 --> 00:08:01.670
our first science superstar.

00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:03.490
Everybody knew who Einstein was.

00:08:03.490 --> 00:08:05.710
And what we used
to say in that time

00:08:05.710 --> 00:08:07.290
was that everyone
knew who Einstein

00:08:07.290 --> 00:08:09.670
was but no one understood
the theory of relativity.

00:08:09.670 --> 00:08:12.620
They said six people in
the world understood it,

00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:15.685
which is-- I don't think
that was an exaggeration.

00:08:15.685 --> 00:08:17.935
Well, actually, I think there
are many more people who

00:08:17.935 --> 00:08:20.320
know it, but that was the idea.

00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:22.790
But I got very
interested in scientists,

00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:30.170
and I began to see--
before I was at Juilliard,

00:08:30.170 --> 00:08:32.789
I was at the
University of Chicago,

00:08:32.789 --> 00:08:36.239
and I was studying
mathematics and physics,

00:08:36.239 --> 00:08:38.760
and I wasn't
particularly good at it.

00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:41.320
I loved it, but I
realized that I was never

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:43.309
going to be very good at that.

00:08:43.309 --> 00:08:45.980
What I could do-- I
was writing music.

00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:48.410
I knew that it was
going to be music.

00:08:48.410 --> 00:08:53.490
I became very
interested in scientists

00:08:53.490 --> 00:08:55.170
and environmentalists
and anybody

00:08:55.170 --> 00:09:03.770
who was connected to the living,
organic world that we live in,

00:09:03.770 --> 00:09:11.520
and in a funny way, I became
the scientist composer.

00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:18.530
I've written an opera about
Einstein, Galileo, Kepler,

00:09:18.530 --> 00:09:19.430
Stephen Hawking.

00:09:19.430 --> 00:09:22.700
I did a movie about him.

00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:31.410
Just a couple years ago, Brian
Greene, who is a string theory

00:09:31.410 --> 00:09:34.680
physicist-- I did
a piece with him.

00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:37.880
So I began writing
music for sciences.

00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:41.650
And then, in fact, this
year, one of the people

00:09:41.650 --> 00:09:44.790
who's going to come at the--
the center is about music.

00:09:44.790 --> 00:09:45.900
It's about dance.

00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:47.630
It's about film.

00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:48.500
It's about poetry.

00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:51.680
All those things are in
this festival this year.

00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:54.140
But I have these
other issues, too.

00:09:54.140 --> 00:09:56.850
So someone I know has
written a book called

00:09:56.850 --> 00:10:02.780
"The Well-Tempered City,"
and it's about-- his name

00:10:02.780 --> 00:10:04.900
was Jonathan Rose.

00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:09.310
He does a very interesting
study of cities from Ur.

00:10:09.310 --> 00:10:10.910
We call that the first city.

00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:12.830
He compares it to
Baltimore and Dayton,

00:10:12.830 --> 00:10:16.280
and he talks about
the issues of what

00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:21.020
a city needs to do to be
successful or to survive.

00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:23.100
You know, there are cities
around the world that

00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:26.500
have suddenly disappeared,
and we don't know why.

00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:28.160
They become ghost towns.

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:30.940
We think maybe the water
supply disappeared,

00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:32.820
or there was a
disease or something.

00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:35.680
But you can visit these cities.

00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:39.290
So there are cities that
have been successful.

00:10:39.290 --> 00:10:42.990
Paris, London-- they've
been around a long time.

00:10:42.990 --> 00:10:45.500
We don't know what San
Francisco or Los Angeles-- I

00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:48.210
don't know if they've been
around that long yet, but any

00:10:48.210 --> 00:10:51.220
of the New World cities--
well, Mexico City.

00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:52.990
My god, that's an amazing city.

00:10:52.990 --> 00:10:59.210
When Cortes arrived and they
saw Mexico City, at that time

00:10:59.210 --> 00:11:01.260
it was in the Valley of Mexico.

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:03.690
You know this-- because
he's from Mexico.

00:11:03.690 --> 00:11:05.810
There were a million
people living there.

00:11:05.810 --> 00:11:12.560
Now at that time, we're
talking about the 15th century.

00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:16.250
The European cities
were 30,000, 40,000.

00:11:16.250 --> 00:11:18.750
London was 40, 50,000.

00:11:18.750 --> 00:11:21.440
Mexico City was
a million people.

00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:26.140
Now they had already
mastered some-- of course,

00:11:26.140 --> 00:11:27.150
you know all this.

00:11:27.150 --> 00:11:30.130
It was a city that
was built on water,

00:11:30.130 --> 00:11:33.240
and so there were-- and
it's all very interesting.

00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:35.400
But I got interested
in all this stuff.

00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:39.110
And so this year,
Johnson Rose is

00:11:39.110 --> 00:11:42.910
going to be giving talks
about the well-tempered city.

00:11:42.910 --> 00:11:46.100
And he uses the well-tempered--
from the Bach idea,

00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:51.380
the well-tempered clavier.

00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:54.520
It has to do about
tuning, and it's

00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:56.690
a subtle and
extremely intriguing

00:11:56.690 --> 00:12:00.740
idea about perfect tuning,
about relative tuning.

00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:03.420
Actually, this is
relative tuning.

00:12:03.420 --> 00:12:08.710
And besides that, Jonathan
also plays electric bass,

00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:11.710
which you know, and he's going
to be playing electric bass one

00:12:11.710 --> 00:12:13.260
night of the concert.

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:16.030
So I've got my
scientist playing bass

00:12:16.030 --> 00:12:20.990
in the orchestra, which is--
so these kinds of things that

00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:25.680
interest me, where you
have a meeting of cultures.

00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:28.040
And here's the interesting
thing, I think.

00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:29.990
That people that are
interested in science

00:12:29.990 --> 00:12:32.770
are very often interested
in music and in dance.

00:12:32.770 --> 00:12:35.390
It's the same people.

00:12:35.390 --> 00:12:37.390
And the other thing
that I began to realize

00:12:37.390 --> 00:12:40.110
is the more I knew
about science,

00:12:40.110 --> 00:12:45.100
I began to think of science
as a kind of poetry.

00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:46.610
ARTURO BEJAR:
Yeah, and so that's

00:12:46.610 --> 00:12:49.240
one of the things I
wanted to ask you about--

00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:53.120
was to talk a little bit
about the piece for Brian

00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:55.280
Greene around the black holes.

00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:58.520
Like, you take a concept
around physics concepts.

00:12:58.520 --> 00:13:00.479
And how do you match
those to musical language?

00:13:00.479 --> 00:13:02.853
PHILIP GLASS: Well, now I did
the black hole-- of course,

00:13:02.853 --> 00:13:03.990
everybody knows this.

00:13:03.990 --> 00:13:05.520
I'll tell you anyway.

00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:08.814
If you get too near a black
hole, you get sucked into it,

00:13:08.814 --> 00:13:09.730
and you can't get out.

00:13:09.730 --> 00:13:11.780
But it has other
property of-- time

00:13:11.780 --> 00:13:16.120
slows down so that when you
get into the black hole,

00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:19.500
time is actually stopped.

00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:21.870
So when I was writing
this piece with-- Brian

00:13:21.870 --> 00:13:24.097
would call me and say,
have you got to the part

00:13:24.097 --> 00:13:25.180
where the time slows down?

00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:26.680
I said, yeah, I'm
working on it now.

00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:28.860
He said, can I come
down and hear it?

00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:30.240
I said OK.

00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:33.410
So he came down to the studio,
and I played this piece

00:13:33.410 --> 00:13:36.910
where the music was very
high and moving very fast,

00:13:36.910 --> 00:13:41.250
and as it goes lower and lower,
it gets slower and slower,

00:13:41.250 --> 00:13:42.960
and finally, it just stops.

00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:47.350
And Brian said, yeah, that's it.

00:13:47.350 --> 00:13:53.600
And he said, you know, I
insist that this is accurate.

00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:57.250
Again, I was turning science
into poetry, actually.

00:13:57.250 --> 00:13:59.480
But now getting back to
this idea about poetry--

00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:04.460
and I'm very serious
about this-- Einstein was

00:14:04.460 --> 00:14:09.180
asked-- once he was describing
where he got his ideas.

00:14:09.180 --> 00:14:11.600
A lot of times it would
be the idea of relativity.

00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:17.330
He said, well-- this
is what he said.

00:14:17.330 --> 00:14:21.530
I imagine myself sitting
on a beam of light,

00:14:21.530 --> 00:14:24.690
and the beam of light is
rushing through the universe

00:14:24.690 --> 00:14:26.990
at the speed of light.

00:14:26.990 --> 00:14:30.520
And I look around me, I saw
everything rushing past me,

00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:33.180
and I was standing still.

00:14:33.180 --> 00:14:35.790
He said, after that, it was
just a question of figuring out

00:14:35.790 --> 00:14:39.306
the mathematics, which
he said was hard for him.

00:14:39.306 --> 00:14:40.200
What?

00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:43.120
Evidently, it was not hard--
I mean, not that hard for him.

00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:46.050
But so I began to
see-- not only him,

00:14:46.050 --> 00:14:49.830
but you look at
someone like Darwin.

00:14:49.830 --> 00:14:51.740
The biological sciences
are very different

00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:53.590
from the physical sciences.

00:14:53.590 --> 00:14:56.530
The physical
sciences-- we do a lot

00:14:56.530 --> 00:14:59.220
of deduction and mathematics.

00:14:59.220 --> 00:15:00.960
Biological science--
there's induction.

00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:02.715
That means a lot of observation.

00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:11.970
He went on the famous
voyage of the Beagle.

00:15:11.970 --> 00:15:16.090
He was, I think, out for about
two years in a boat and just

00:15:16.090 --> 00:15:19.710
looking at species and how
they change from island--

00:15:19.710 --> 00:15:22.650
he was out in the south
seas, and he went from island

00:15:22.650 --> 00:15:23.150
to island.

00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:25.740
He would see that
almost the same species

00:15:25.740 --> 00:15:28.320
would be on another island
but had changed a little bit.

00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:33.220
He began to see how
biological entities like this

00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:37.180
could change, and he didn't
think very much about it.

00:15:37.180 --> 00:15:39.670
He just collected information,
collected information.

00:15:39.670 --> 00:15:46.042
And he finally came up with this
astonishing idea of mutation,

00:15:46.042 --> 00:15:51.410
that things change because
of sunspots or whatever

00:15:51.410 --> 00:15:54.454
for natural reasons,
and then what

00:15:54.454 --> 00:15:55.870
he called natural
selection, which

00:15:55.870 --> 00:16:00.020
is that after the
mutation change,

00:16:00.020 --> 00:16:04.080
this new entity, if
it has survivability,

00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:09.070
would then replace
the non-mutated one so

00:16:09.070 --> 00:16:12.690
that natural selection
became a form-- that's

00:16:12.690 --> 00:16:15.170
where the idea of
evolution came from.

00:16:15.170 --> 00:16:16.545
And this is also
an astonishing--

00:16:16.545 --> 00:16:18.020
if you think about it.

00:16:18.020 --> 00:16:20.130
I mean, can you imagine
if you had been doing this

00:16:20.130 --> 00:16:21.890
and you had been on
a boat for two years

00:16:21.890 --> 00:16:23.310
just looking at flowers?

00:16:23.310 --> 00:16:25.020
Would you have come
up with this idea?

00:16:25.020 --> 00:16:25.370
ARTURO BEJAR: I don't think so.

00:16:25.370 --> 00:16:27.450
PHILIP GLASS: I don't
know about that.

00:16:27.450 --> 00:16:34.390
I just find that these
amazing scientists

00:16:34.390 --> 00:16:37.310
have the dreams of poets.

00:16:37.310 --> 00:16:41.360
And then they have to find
the science to explain it.

00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:44.960
But without the vision,
there is no theory.

00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:49.540
So in a way, I began to see--
I came to this as a very

00:16:49.540 --> 00:16:52.240
young man, and I
began to see science

00:16:52.240 --> 00:17:00.620
as a form of poetry, a
poetry which has the ability

00:17:00.620 --> 00:17:05.810
to create technology
which then really changes

00:17:05.810 --> 00:17:08.290
things even more rapidly.

00:17:08.290 --> 00:17:11.450
So I got very involved with
the idea of science in music,

00:17:11.450 --> 00:17:16.520
and then of course, because
as a modern person--

00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:20.859
I began to think about climate
change and things like that.

00:17:20.859 --> 00:17:26.369
And so the concerts that we
do and what I try to do-- I'm

00:17:26.369 --> 00:17:28.130
trying to bring
them all together,

00:17:28.130 --> 00:17:30.770
and we are actually
kind of succeeding.

00:17:30.770 --> 00:17:33.210
And this time, Jonathan
is going to come and give

00:17:33.210 --> 00:17:36.570
a talk about the city.

00:17:36.570 --> 00:17:41.070
I've got the copy
of the final draft.

00:17:41.070 --> 00:17:43.380
It's not been printed yet.

00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:45.000
It's so interesting to read.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.660
It is kind of like
poetry, but it

00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:50.817
took someone who was willing to
sit down and think about this

00:17:50.817 --> 00:17:52.650
and to come up with
the-- you know Jonathan.

00:17:52.650 --> 00:17:53.680
ARTURO BEJAR: Yeah.

00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:56.970
PHILIP GLASS: At any rate-- so
anyway, what was the question?

00:18:00.148 --> 00:18:01.850
ARTURO BEJAR: No,
you talked about it.

00:18:01.850 --> 00:18:05.390
It was about how you set black
holes to music or the theory

00:18:05.390 --> 00:18:06.980
behind it to music.

00:18:06.980 --> 00:18:09.450
PHILIP GLASS: You
know, what I find

00:18:09.450 --> 00:18:12.660
is that it's not just my ideas.

00:18:12.660 --> 00:18:15.070
I find many people are
interested in science

00:18:15.070 --> 00:18:18.900
and art and dance and theater.

00:18:18.900 --> 00:18:21.090
Poetry.

00:18:21.090 --> 00:18:22.890
It goes together very well.

00:18:22.890 --> 00:18:25.020
ARTURO BEJAR: Which
takes me to another thing

00:18:25.020 --> 00:18:30.370
that I got to watch, which was
the concept around language

00:18:30.370 --> 00:18:32.340
and collaboration.

00:18:32.340 --> 00:18:33.840
So I was wondering
if you could talk

00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:35.660
a little bit about
when you began

00:18:35.660 --> 00:18:37.370
collaborating with Foday Suso.

00:18:37.370 --> 00:18:39.450
PHILIP GLASS: Oh,
that's interesting.

00:18:39.450 --> 00:18:41.580
That's a different thing.

00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:45.910
I was cooperating with
dancers and filmmakers

00:18:45.910 --> 00:18:47.470
at the center over
there, and then I

00:18:47.470 --> 00:18:51.550
began collaborating with
composers, first just people

00:18:51.550 --> 00:18:54.160
that I knew-- but then I
began working with composers

00:18:54.160 --> 00:19:01.030
from completely
different traditions,

00:19:01.030 --> 00:19:04.890
and that really changed my ideas
about music more than anything

00:19:04.890 --> 00:19:05.390
else.

00:19:05.390 --> 00:19:08.560
I just played Arturo
some music that I

00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:12.800
had made with some indigenous
people from Mexico.

00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:15.050
Indians, actually, who
live in the mountains.

00:19:15.050 --> 00:19:17.050
They didn't even speak Spanish.

00:19:17.050 --> 00:19:20.330
I certainly didn't
speak Indian languages.

00:19:20.330 --> 00:19:23.080
And we managed to put
a record together.

00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:26.540
And with Foday
Suso-- he's a griot.

00:19:30.290 --> 00:19:35.690
He's from the Mandinka people
in West Africa, the Gambia.

00:19:35.690 --> 00:19:39.050
That's near Senegal and Mali,
kind of right in between them.

00:19:39.050 --> 00:19:48.770
And he tells a story of the
Mandinka people and music.

00:19:48.770 --> 00:19:49.940
The griots do that.

00:19:49.940 --> 00:19:53.460
They have something
like 107, 106 songs

00:19:53.460 --> 00:19:55.000
that they have to learn.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:56.560
I know him very well.

00:19:56.560 --> 00:19:58.310
I met him more
than 35 years ago.

00:19:58.310 --> 00:20:02.530
We do concerts quite a
lot together since then.

00:20:02.530 --> 00:20:04.480
But let me tell you a
story, a funny story.

00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:06.230
Then maybe we will go
on to something else

00:20:06.230 --> 00:20:08.999
because I can tell funny stories
all night without getting

00:20:08.999 --> 00:20:11.290
to the point that we're maybe
trying to get to, which--

00:20:11.290 --> 00:20:12.498
I'm not even sure what it is.

00:20:15.450 --> 00:20:17.650
So the first time
I saw Foday, he

00:20:17.650 --> 00:20:21.830
has a big kora, which is a
gourd, and there are 17--

00:20:21.830 --> 00:20:24.740
or is it-- 17, 18 strings.

00:20:24.740 --> 00:20:25.870
And he plays the strings.

00:20:25.870 --> 00:20:27.650
It's like a harp.

00:20:27.650 --> 00:20:31.810
And the gourd takes the sound,
and it comes out that way.

00:20:31.810 --> 00:20:33.690
Of course, we also
amplify it, too.

00:20:38.904 --> 00:20:40.320
I was asked to do
music for a play

00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:45.470
by Jean Genet called "Les
Paravents," "The Screens."

00:20:45.470 --> 00:20:51.380
Now, it was a story about
the French in North Africa.

00:20:51.380 --> 00:20:54.130
So I thought, well,
maybe I should

00:20:54.130 --> 00:20:56.700
do a piece with an
African composer,

00:20:56.700 --> 00:20:59.690
and I would be the
European-based-- I'm not

00:20:59.690 --> 00:21:03.110
European, but the music is based
on Central European art music,

00:21:03.110 --> 00:21:04.890
so that goes with that.

00:21:04.890 --> 00:21:09.000
And so I asked Foday-- I
had gone on a trip with him

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:12.570
to Africa working with Godfrey
Reggio in a movie called

00:21:12.570 --> 00:21:15.180
"Powaqqatsi," and he had
taken me to hear music,

00:21:15.180 --> 00:21:17.925
but I hadn't thought that
much about the music itself.

00:21:17.925 --> 00:21:19.550
I mean, I liked it,
but I didn't really

00:21:19.550 --> 00:21:22.180
think about how it was made.

00:21:22.180 --> 00:21:24.620
And so then I called Foday.

00:21:24.620 --> 00:21:27.210
I said, I have to do this piece.

00:21:27.210 --> 00:21:29.880
We have to do African
and European music

00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:31.950
sometimes together but
sometimes separate.

00:21:31.950 --> 00:21:32.450
OK.

00:21:32.450 --> 00:21:34.640
So we came to the studio.

00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:39.490
And now I knew this
from my experiences--

00:21:39.490 --> 00:21:43.020
the first thing we had to do
was to tune the instruments.

00:21:43.020 --> 00:21:45.220
I mean, without that,
we can't even play.

00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:49.520
This is basic stuff.

00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:53.130
The piano was a little
too complicated.

00:21:53.130 --> 00:21:56.410
So we kept the piano, and
he would tune to the piano.

00:21:56.410 --> 00:21:58.810
Now, the scale in
the African music

00:21:58.810 --> 00:22:00.290
is a little bit different.

00:22:00.290 --> 00:22:01.690
The fourth-- I don't know.

00:22:01.690 --> 00:22:05.440
So not to get too technical,
but the fourth note of the scale

00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:08.120
is a little more
flat than ours is,

00:22:08.120 --> 00:22:10.330
and the third is a
little more sharp.

00:22:10.330 --> 00:22:16.650
So if you listen to-- if
he played with the piano,

00:22:16.650 --> 00:22:18.090
somebody would
sound out of tune.

00:22:18.090 --> 00:22:21.260
It probably would have been
him because I can play louder

00:22:21.260 --> 00:22:23.255
than him, but not necessarily.

00:22:25.940 --> 00:22:30.210
So he had lived in the
States for a while.

00:22:30.210 --> 00:22:32.550
He traveled back
and forth to Africa,

00:22:32.550 --> 00:22:34.910
but he came, and he
had learned to retune.

00:22:34.910 --> 00:22:36.770
He was retuning his instrument.

00:22:36.770 --> 00:22:39.860
He was playing with Herbie
Hancock and people like that

00:22:39.860 --> 00:22:42.650
and playing at jazz, and
he had to tune with them,

00:22:42.650 --> 00:22:44.584
so he knew how to do it.

00:22:44.584 --> 00:22:46.000
I didn't know
anything about that.

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:51.460
So we sat down, and he played a
note which was similar to an A,

00:22:51.460 --> 00:22:54.550
very close to an A, and he
said, this is the first note.

00:22:54.550 --> 00:22:59.220
I said, OK, so here's the
A. Here's my piano note.

00:22:59.220 --> 00:23:04.610
And he tuned it, got it right,
and he nodded and said--

00:23:04.610 --> 00:23:07.950
and I go to the B
flat above that,

00:23:07.950 --> 00:23:11.920
and he played-- well, actually,
I went to the B natural

00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:13.750
because we were kind of in D.

00:23:13.750 --> 00:23:17.647
And he played the B, and
I said, wait a second.

00:23:17.647 --> 00:23:18.980
What do you call the first note?

00:23:18.980 --> 00:23:21.900
He said, well, that's
the first note.

00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:25.050
I said OK, did the
second note, and I said,

00:23:25.050 --> 00:23:26.050
what do you call this?

00:23:26.050 --> 00:23:29.820
And he said, I call
that the second note.

00:23:29.820 --> 00:23:32.020
And then we got to the third
note, which is C sharp.

00:23:32.020 --> 00:23:36.030
I tuned it, and he said--
I knew what was coming.

00:23:36.030 --> 00:23:38.590
And he said, that's the
one that's the one that

00:23:38.590 --> 00:23:41.240
comes after the one before.

00:23:41.240 --> 00:23:45.210
And then I suddenly
had the realization

00:23:45.210 --> 00:23:50.110
that his notes
didn't have names.

00:23:50.110 --> 00:23:53.440
And when I was a kid, I
took my first flute lesson

00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:57.650
with a flutist from the Peabody
Conservatory in Baltimore.

00:23:57.650 --> 00:23:59.304
And he gave me a flute.

00:23:59.304 --> 00:24:00.220
You hold it like this.

00:24:00.220 --> 00:24:03.210
He said, OK, put your thumb
here and the finger there.

00:24:03.210 --> 00:24:07.430
And I had the position, and
I blow through the hole here.

00:24:07.430 --> 00:24:08.710
And he's pointing on the page.

00:24:08.710 --> 00:24:10.680
He said, that's
a B. He showed me

00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:14.430
what it looked like, he
showed what it sounded like,

00:24:14.430 --> 00:24:17.730
and he showed me
how to finger it.

00:24:17.730 --> 00:24:22.420
So at that moment, I identified
the name of the note,

00:24:22.420 --> 00:24:30.410
the position of the hand, and
the intonation of the note.

00:24:30.410 --> 00:24:32.740
There was the sound of the
note, the key of the note.

00:24:35.790 --> 00:24:42.286
This was now-- oh, I would guess
25 years later, 20 years later.

00:24:42.286 --> 00:24:44.285
I'm sitting with this
guy, and he tells me there

00:24:44.285 --> 00:24:46.160
are no names to the notes.

00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:47.790
And I almost fainted.

00:24:47.790 --> 00:24:49.460
I was so shocked.

00:24:49.460 --> 00:24:52.530
I felt like the
floor had opened up

00:24:52.530 --> 00:24:54.440
and I was floating in the air.

00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:57.730
I said, Foday, I have to stop.

00:24:57.730 --> 00:25:00.210
And I got up, and I had to
walk out and walked around.

00:25:00.210 --> 00:25:03.184
I said this is-- I
couldn't fathom this,

00:25:03.184 --> 00:25:05.850
that he could play music without
knowing the names of the notes.

00:25:08.670 --> 00:25:10.820
So we got over that.

00:25:10.820 --> 00:25:14.110
We ended up being
collaborators, and we've

00:25:14.110 --> 00:25:15.800
done many, many
concerts together.

00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:20.860
He knows the names of the
notes now, by the way.

00:25:24.990 --> 00:25:28.830
But he never bothered to
know them before that.

00:25:28.830 --> 00:25:37.430
So when I began working with
people from other traditions,

00:25:37.430 --> 00:25:42.080
the way we understand
music not emotionally

00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:43.980
but structurally
and intellectually--

00:25:43.980 --> 00:25:45.640
it was very different.

00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:48.140
Emotionally, I could
understand it very quickly,

00:25:48.140 --> 00:25:50.530
but how he thought
about it I didn't.

00:25:50.530 --> 00:25:53.690
This happened some years before.

00:25:53.690 --> 00:25:56.480
It happened when I had been
working with Ravi Shankar

00:25:56.480 --> 00:26:00.290
and I was working
with Alla Rahka.

00:26:00.290 --> 00:26:02.944
I was learning the rhythmic
system of Indian music.

00:26:02.944 --> 00:26:04.110
That's the end of the story.

00:26:04.110 --> 00:26:05.070
I won't get into it.

00:26:05.070 --> 00:26:07.460
Anyway, that was
another good story which

00:26:07.460 --> 00:26:08.550
I'm not going to tell now.

00:26:08.550 --> 00:26:18.680
But the point was that I
began to see that in order

00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:20.390
for musicians to
play together who

00:26:20.390 --> 00:26:24.900
come from-- we have to start
to make some accommodation.

00:26:24.900 --> 00:26:29.585
And when he went back
to Africa, by the way,

00:26:29.585 --> 00:26:31.960
and his friends found out he
had retuned the instruments,

00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:33.410
they were very upset.

00:26:33.410 --> 00:26:35.500
They said, you can't
retune the kora.

00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:40.005
He said, well, if you want
to play in Europe or America,

00:26:40.005 --> 00:26:40.880
you've got to retune.

00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:41.963
And they said, no, no, no.

00:26:41.963 --> 00:26:43.170
We're not going to retune.

00:26:43.170 --> 00:26:45.211
He said, well, then you're
not going to play out.

00:26:45.211 --> 00:26:47.599
You're not going to play there.

00:26:47.599 --> 00:26:49.390
And so he said, well,
let me hear you play.

00:26:49.390 --> 00:26:51.514
And then he had
retuned the kora,

00:26:51.514 --> 00:26:52.680
and he was playing the kora.

00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:54.013
And he said, it sounded perfect.

00:26:54.013 --> 00:26:55.560
Same thing happened
Ravi Shankar.

00:26:55.560 --> 00:26:58.160
When he came to
America and Europe

00:26:58.160 --> 00:27:00.840
in person to some big
concerts, back in India

00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:04.300
they thought he had
betrayed the raga,

00:27:04.300 --> 00:27:07.894
and he had to go back to India
and do it at a big concert.

00:27:07.894 --> 00:27:08.560
He told me this.

00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:11.040
He did a big concert in
Bombay and one in Delhi,

00:27:11.040 --> 00:27:14.830
and he had to prove to people
he could still play the sitar.

00:27:14.830 --> 00:27:17.994
They thought he had
forgotten how to play it.

00:27:17.994 --> 00:27:18.880
ARTURO BEJAR: Wow.

00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:23.100
PHILIP GLASS: So the
tuning thing is a big deal.

00:27:23.100 --> 00:27:27.820
But what was
interesting was I began

00:27:27.820 --> 00:27:34.170
to understand that there's
a relative truth to music,

00:27:34.170 --> 00:27:36.330
and there's an absolute truth.

00:27:36.330 --> 00:27:38.480
The absolute truth we
have no problem with.

00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:40.480
It's the relative truth
that we have the problem

00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:42.120
with, the tuning.

00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:44.280
But when I don't have
to do the tuning,

00:27:44.280 --> 00:27:53.480
I can totally get-- working
with the Mexican musicians,

00:27:53.480 --> 00:27:55.790
I could not figure
out how they counted.

00:27:55.790 --> 00:27:57.810
They were doing it
in a rhythmic cycle,

00:27:57.810 --> 00:28:00.990
but it sounded to me like
there would be a cycle of 15,

00:28:00.990 --> 00:28:02.820
then a cycle of
15, a cycle of 15.

00:28:02.820 --> 00:28:04.940
Then it'd be cycle of 14.

00:28:04.940 --> 00:28:08.030
And I counted again, and every
third time it would be 14.

00:28:08.030 --> 00:28:09.320
I said, OK, I got it.

00:28:09.320 --> 00:28:12.333
And then the next time
they did it, it was 16.

00:28:15.300 --> 00:28:17.340
I couldn't figure--
well, how do they--

00:28:17.340 --> 00:28:19.810
do they just remember that?

00:28:19.810 --> 00:28:22.120
And were they counting at all?

00:28:22.120 --> 00:28:24.166
I think they weren't counting.

00:28:24.166 --> 00:28:25.665
And I was playing
with this one guy.

00:28:25.665 --> 00:28:28.150
He was playing the--
we called it a guitar.

00:28:28.150 --> 00:28:30.150
It looks like a guitar,
but he built it himself.

00:28:35.020 --> 00:28:37.580
We had someone translating
into Spanish for me.

00:28:37.580 --> 00:28:39.660
And I was playing
with him a while,

00:28:39.660 --> 00:28:42.720
and I was trying just to play
with him, and after a while,

00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:44.020
he said, you got it.

00:28:44.020 --> 00:28:44.790
You got it.

00:28:44.790 --> 00:28:48.090
And I began playing with
them, and I missed it again.

00:28:48.090 --> 00:28:50.260
I never figured
out how to do it,

00:28:50.260 --> 00:28:52.390
but what I figured
out-- another thing.

00:28:52.390 --> 00:28:53.160
A different thing.

00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:55.240
I found out, if I
played in a cycle

00:28:55.240 --> 00:29:02.130
long enough, that the
inconsistencies didn't matter.

00:29:02.130 --> 00:29:07.950
Everything would add up to
maybe 86 or something like that.

00:29:07.950 --> 00:29:09.860
I had to work in
a very big cycle,

00:29:09.860 --> 00:29:12.690
and then we could be together.

00:29:12.690 --> 00:29:16.705
ARTURO BEJAR: And that
takes me to the-- he's

00:29:16.705 --> 00:29:19.080
going to play a little bit,
but there's one more question

00:29:19.080 --> 00:29:23.050
before we play for a little bit
and come back to talking later,

00:29:23.050 --> 00:29:25.330
which is-- so you
take these rooms that

00:29:25.330 --> 00:29:30.320
have Jaron Lanier,
Jonathan Rose,

00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:33.340
the guy that comes from
a technology background.

00:29:33.340 --> 00:29:35.070
You've got Suso.

00:29:35.070 --> 00:29:36.670
You've got all of
these people from

00:29:36.670 --> 00:29:40.870
different artistic
sensibilities, instruments,

00:29:40.870 --> 00:29:43.670
musical language.

00:29:43.670 --> 00:29:46.490
They're all talented,
strong-minded.

00:29:46.490 --> 00:29:47.520
How do you get--

00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:51.040
PHILIP GLASS: Well, at the
beginning, in the early 60s,

00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:53.070
we used to get
together, and we'd have

00:29:53.070 --> 00:29:54.920
what we called a world band.

00:29:54.920 --> 00:29:56.835
And you'd find
someone from Africa.

00:29:56.835 --> 00:29:58.120
You'd get someone from India.

00:29:58.120 --> 00:30:00.890
And you all get together,
and it sounded terrible

00:30:00.890 --> 00:30:03.150
because everybody was
in a different key--

00:30:03.150 --> 00:30:03.942
slightly different.

00:30:03.942 --> 00:30:05.691
It's not that you were
in a different key,

00:30:05.691 --> 00:30:08.220
but the fourths were different,
the thirds were different,

00:30:08.220 --> 00:30:11.480
the sixths were different
so that someone was always

00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:19.110
out of tune, and we never
sat down and retuned.

00:30:19.110 --> 00:30:23.580
Basically, these world
bands just dissolved,

00:30:23.580 --> 00:30:26.310
and then after a while,
no one did it anymore.

00:30:26.310 --> 00:30:30.770
It didn't start up again until
I began playing with people,

00:30:30.770 --> 00:30:34.340
and we actually addressed
the issue of tuning.

00:30:34.340 --> 00:30:40.620
That's why it was so-- since
we were in North America,

00:30:40.620 --> 00:30:44.170
we used the European tuning.

00:30:44.170 --> 00:30:47.130
Now there are certain
instruments you can't use.

00:30:47.130 --> 00:30:49.970
A Balaton, which is like a
xylophone-- you can't return

00:30:49.970 --> 00:30:54.090
it, so you won't find that
instrument in any of the-- you

00:30:54.090 --> 00:30:56.850
won't find the African
balafon, but you'll

00:30:56.850 --> 00:31:00.650
find in my music an
American xylophone.

00:31:00.650 --> 00:31:05.100
I have to pick one that's--
some things you can't tune.

00:31:08.900 --> 00:31:12.371
In Australia, the
didgeridoo player--

00:31:12.371 --> 00:31:13.620
you know what a didgeridoo is?

00:31:13.620 --> 00:31:16.640
A long-- I had
one guy I played--

00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:18.504
I love this guy, Mark Atkins.

00:31:18.504 --> 00:31:22.887
And I said, Mark, how do
you make-- where did you

00:31:22.887 --> 00:31:23.720
get that instrument?

00:31:23.720 --> 00:31:26.800
He said, well, I get
a limb off a tree,

00:31:26.800 --> 00:31:30.090
and then I put the ants in,
and the ants eat their way

00:31:30.090 --> 00:31:31.440
through the center.

00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:34.550
He said, I have to come back in
about maybe four, five weeks,

00:31:34.550 --> 00:31:39.570
and then knock it out, and
all the inside of it goes out,

00:31:39.570 --> 00:31:40.990
and I have a long tube.

00:31:40.990 --> 00:31:43.850
And he said, and
that's what I play.

00:31:43.850 --> 00:31:48.070
And I had this fantastic
conversation, and I said, OK.

00:31:48.070 --> 00:31:51.055
Now I was playing with him, and
I said, how do you play that?

00:31:51.055 --> 00:31:53.180
What are you thinking about
when you're playing it?

00:31:53.180 --> 00:32:05.100
He said, well-- and we're
doing a piece called "Orion."

00:32:05.100 --> 00:32:10.520
I did it with musicians
from Brazil, from Africa,

00:32:10.520 --> 00:32:12.310
from China.

00:32:12.310 --> 00:32:18.900
I had five or six--
a guy, Ashton McIsaac

00:32:18.900 --> 00:32:23.140
from Cape Breton,
who played violin.

00:32:23.140 --> 00:32:31.000
And so I began asking people
where their music came from.

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:32.550
This was the most
interesting thing.

00:32:32.550 --> 00:32:34.220
I said, where does
the music come from?

00:32:34.220 --> 00:32:36.400
It's a very simple question.

00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:38.320
And most said,
oh, I'll tell you.

00:32:41.610 --> 00:32:44.880
I get to this place in the
music, and I close my eyes

00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:49.944
and I see a kangaroo
running across the outback,

00:32:49.944 --> 00:32:51.610
and I play the music
that goes with him.

00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:57.810
I asked Ravi Shankar.

00:32:57.810 --> 00:32:58.500
I ask everybody.

00:32:58.500 --> 00:33:00.530
I ask everybody this question.

00:33:00.530 --> 00:33:03.260
You get the most-- it's
a very simple question,

00:33:03.260 --> 00:33:07.384
and if you ask it not
knowing what the answer is,

00:33:07.384 --> 00:33:08.300
you'll get the answer.

00:33:08.300 --> 00:33:11.080
They'll tell you
what they think.

00:33:11.080 --> 00:33:13.170
I asked Ravi Shankar once.

00:33:13.170 --> 00:33:16.960
I said, Ravi, where does
this music come from?

00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:20.120
I was sitting with him in
his hotel room in London.

00:33:20.120 --> 00:33:22.160
It was years and years ago.

00:33:22.160 --> 00:33:26.072
And he turned-- this
is a great story.

00:33:26.072 --> 00:33:27.780
He was sitting on the
bed crossed legged,

00:33:27.780 --> 00:33:31.000
and I was sitting in a
chair, and on the table

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:33.280
was a picture of
an Indian gentleman

00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:35.940
in a narrow kind of coat.

00:33:35.940 --> 00:33:40.090
He turned to the picture, and
he did a full prostration,

00:33:40.090 --> 00:33:42.290
bowed to the
picture, and he said,

00:33:42.290 --> 00:33:46.830
the grace of the guru,
the music is coming to me.

00:33:46.830 --> 00:33:48.244
That beautiful?

00:33:48.244 --> 00:33:50.660
Now let me tell you one more
because you'll like this one.

00:33:50.660 --> 00:33:52.385
This is from the
Indian Mexican guy.

00:33:52.385 --> 00:33:55.160
I like to tell Mexican stories.

00:33:55.160 --> 00:33:58.090
So we had done a
concert together.

00:33:58.090 --> 00:33:59.780
We had just done
a concert together

00:33:59.780 --> 00:34:03.390
in a little place called Real
de Catorce with these two

00:34:03.390 --> 00:34:08.760
musicians, and there was one
guy who was our translator.

00:34:08.760 --> 00:34:12.120
And we went on afterwards
to have a nice fire.

00:34:12.120 --> 00:34:13.650
And they like to do that.

00:34:13.650 --> 00:34:15.560
Nice big fire outside.

00:34:15.560 --> 00:34:16.449
Concert was over.

00:34:16.449 --> 00:34:20.310
We all went out to do the fire.

00:34:20.310 --> 00:34:25.130
[INAUDIBLE] was standing there,
and I say, [INAUDIBLE], where

00:34:25.130 --> 00:34:26.750
does that music come from?

00:34:26.750 --> 00:34:28.980
The same question.

00:34:28.980 --> 00:34:31.840
You'll never-- you can't
imagine what people say.

00:34:31.840 --> 00:34:32.690
Unimaginable things.

00:34:32.690 --> 00:34:37.840
He said, well, I
looked at my father--

00:34:37.840 --> 00:34:40.929
my grandfather, the fire.

00:34:40.929 --> 00:34:44.389
My grandfather, the
fire, has no mouth,

00:34:44.389 --> 00:34:47.070
so when he wants to
sing, he has to use mine.

00:34:47.070 --> 00:34:49.679
ARTURO BEJAR: Oh, wow.

00:34:49.679 --> 00:34:55.560
PHILIP GLASS: I mean, these are
revelations that are profound,

00:34:55.560 --> 00:35:00.030
and I must say that I've
gone through my life in music

00:35:00.030 --> 00:35:02.470
talking to people very
simply about music

00:35:02.470 --> 00:35:06.700
and asking what-- and then
people ask me the same thing.

00:35:06.700 --> 00:35:09.360
I say-- I had even
better-- I don't

00:35:09.360 --> 00:35:11.550
know if I'll go into that.

00:35:11.550 --> 00:35:13.470
Shall we go onto something else?

00:35:13.470 --> 00:35:14.220
ARTURO BEJAR: Yes.

00:35:14.220 --> 00:35:17.195
The piano, and then I'll ask
you where that music came from.

00:35:17.195 --> 00:35:18.070
PHILIP GLASS: Oh, OK.

00:35:18.070 --> 00:35:19.656
OK.

00:35:19.656 --> 00:35:20.780
I said I was going to play.

00:35:20.780 --> 00:35:23.660
We had a wonderful
concert yesterday,

00:35:23.660 --> 00:35:26.750
and I thought I couldn't come
here and not play tonight.

00:35:26.750 --> 00:35:30.890
So it's going to be one
piece called "Mad Rush."

00:35:30.890 --> 00:35:32.820
I'm playing it because
he likes that piece.

00:35:32.820 --> 00:35:34.330
I hope you like it, too.

00:35:34.330 --> 00:35:39.650
It's a piece originally written
for the organ of St. John

00:35:39.650 --> 00:35:41.980
the Divine, the
cathedral in New York.

00:35:41.980 --> 00:35:44.550
It was the occasion of the
Dalai Lama's first visit

00:35:44.550 --> 00:35:47.880
to New York in '78, and they
were going to give a talk.

00:35:47.880 --> 00:35:51.570
And the people who organized
the event weren't sure

00:35:51.570 --> 00:35:54.230
when he was going to arrive
exactly, so they said, well,

00:35:54.230 --> 00:35:57.920
why don't you-- could you play,
just play some music until he

00:35:57.920 --> 00:35:58.740
comes?

00:35:58.740 --> 00:36:00.906
Oh, I didn't know when he
was going to come, either.

00:36:00.906 --> 00:36:03.550
So I had composed-- I
composed the music for that,

00:36:03.550 --> 00:36:05.957
and that occasion, I
played for about half an--

00:36:05.957 --> 00:36:07.540
I'm not gong to play
for half an hour.

00:36:07.540 --> 00:36:08.850
I'll play about 14 minutes.

00:36:12.100 --> 00:36:15.900
So I made a piece of
indefinite length.

00:36:15.900 --> 00:36:16.900
Actually, not a problem.

00:36:20.210 --> 00:36:22.450
On that occasion,
it was half an hour,

00:36:22.450 --> 00:36:25.430
but I'm going to play about
half that version right now.

00:36:25.430 --> 00:36:29.027
So this is-- oh, the piece
is called "Mad Rush."

00:36:29.027 --> 00:36:31.023
[APPLAUSE]

00:36:37.011 --> 00:36:39.007
[PLAYING "MAD RUSH"]

00:51:28.724 --> 00:51:30.720
[APPLAUSE]

00:51:39.202 --> 00:51:39.702
Thank you.

00:51:46.687 --> 00:51:47.187
Thank you.

00:51:55.110 --> 00:51:56.394
ARTURO BEJAR: I love you, man.

00:51:56.394 --> 00:51:57.560
PHILIP GLASS: What was that?

00:51:57.560 --> 00:51:58.810
ARTURO BEJAR: I love you, man.

00:52:01.400 --> 00:52:03.779
So where did that come from?

00:52:03.779 --> 00:52:06.070
PHILIP GLASS: You know, I
ask myself the same question.

00:52:06.070 --> 00:52:08.170
I could never come up
with the right answer.

00:52:08.170 --> 00:52:11.120
But something-- I come up
with an answer for a while.

00:52:11.120 --> 00:52:14.890
I first say, well, music
is a kind of language.

00:52:14.890 --> 00:52:20.020
But you know, that's
like saying a chicken is

00:52:20.020 --> 00:52:21.410
kind of like a bird.

00:52:21.410 --> 00:52:23.070
It doesn't tell you anything.

00:52:23.070 --> 00:52:25.540
It doesn't tell you something
you already don't know.

00:52:25.540 --> 00:52:28.220
It didn't reveal anything to
me, and I was very dissatisfied

00:52:28.220 --> 00:52:31.490
with that, but for a long
while, I had no answer.

00:52:31.490 --> 00:52:33.850
So I would continue
asking people.

00:52:33.850 --> 00:52:35.960
And then about four
or five years ago,

00:52:35.960 --> 00:52:39.870
I was giving a talk, kind of
like we're doing right now,

00:52:39.870 --> 00:52:41.920
and someone in the
audience said, well,

00:52:41.920 --> 00:52:43.060
where does music come from?

00:52:43.060 --> 00:52:44.970
And here's what I did.

00:52:44.970 --> 00:52:46.590
I answered.

00:52:46.590 --> 00:52:49.230
I said something I
wasn't prepared to say.

00:52:49.230 --> 00:52:51.610
It was almost like
someone else had said it.

00:52:51.610 --> 00:52:56.060
I said, well, music is a place.

00:52:56.060 --> 00:53:00.940
It's as real as Chicago
or Atlanta or Boston.

00:53:00.940 --> 00:53:05.210
It's a place, and when
you go to listen to music,

00:53:05.210 --> 00:53:07.620
you go to that place.

00:53:07.620 --> 00:53:09.789
I thought, OK.

00:53:09.789 --> 00:53:11.330
I hadn't heard that
one before, and I

00:53:11.330 --> 00:53:15.920
thought that was--
that seems right to me.

00:53:15.920 --> 00:53:19.380
ARTURO BEJAR: So
one of the things

00:53:19.380 --> 00:53:22.960
that I appreciate the
most about your career

00:53:22.960 --> 00:53:25.150
is that you have
these collaborations,

00:53:25.150 --> 00:53:28.130
like with Godfrey--
began with "Powaqqatsi,"

00:53:28.130 --> 00:53:32.563
and made a movie a couple of
years ago, a year or two ago.

00:53:32.563 --> 00:53:33.430
You have Suso.

00:53:33.430 --> 00:53:35.180
You have the ensemble
that's been together

00:53:35.180 --> 00:53:37.170
for a really long time.

00:53:37.170 --> 00:53:41.150
And so how you
manage to have all

00:53:41.150 --> 00:53:43.530
of these great
collaborative friendships

00:53:43.530 --> 00:53:47.680
over that long a period of
time and have them sustained?

00:53:47.680 --> 00:53:51.360
PHILIP GLASS: You
know, I'm-- music is,

00:53:51.360 --> 00:53:56.420
above everything else,
a social activity.

00:53:56.420 --> 00:53:58.554
It's not only between
myself and the audience.

00:53:58.554 --> 00:53:59.970
It's between the
people that play.

00:54:03.050 --> 00:54:05.870
I accepted that very early.

00:54:05.870 --> 00:54:08.760
As a boy, I played a
flute in an orchestra.

00:54:08.760 --> 00:54:09.730
I was 10 years old.

00:54:09.730 --> 00:54:12.800
I was playing in
the orchestra then.

00:54:12.800 --> 00:54:15.990
Music to me was always something
that people did together.

00:54:15.990 --> 00:54:17.290
It wasn't a problem.

00:54:17.290 --> 00:54:20.300
I've met now--
because of the-- I've

00:54:20.300 --> 00:54:24.440
met several players, musicians
here, on this trip here,

00:54:24.440 --> 00:54:27.720
and I'm going to be playing
with them at some point.

00:54:27.720 --> 00:54:30.440
As soon as I hear somebody or
I meet them, if I like them,

00:54:30.440 --> 00:54:35.237
I want to play music with them,
and then I find a way to do it.

00:54:35.237 --> 00:54:37.820
Then I have to look and say, do
I really have time to do this?

00:54:37.820 --> 00:54:39.819
And I look, and it goes,
yeah, there is a state.

00:54:39.819 --> 00:54:42.080
And I find it, and I
just put the date in.

00:54:45.710 --> 00:54:46.700
Yeah.

00:54:46.700 --> 00:54:51.920
It's like I kind of, I would
say-- not an obsession,

00:54:51.920 --> 00:54:54.350
because it has a
negative sound to it.

00:54:54.350 --> 00:55:03.210
It's an attraction that
is very strong for me.

00:55:03.210 --> 00:55:07.160
And so all playing with other
people-- I do do concerts.

00:55:07.160 --> 00:55:10.200
I do solo concerts, and I like
to do them in a certain way

00:55:10.200 --> 00:55:13.770
because when I do solo
concerts, I can often

00:55:13.770 --> 00:55:15.220
play pieces differently.

00:55:15.220 --> 00:55:18.220
If I play with other people,
then I have to play the way

00:55:18.220 --> 00:55:18.760
I wrote it.

00:55:18.760 --> 00:55:21.460
Well, that's pretty
much the way I wrote it.

00:55:21.460 --> 00:55:25.080
But I'd like to do
solo concerts also

00:55:25.080 --> 00:55:26.920
because that's
something different.

00:55:29.840 --> 00:55:32.130
It is not so much about
playing with another person

00:55:32.130 --> 00:55:33.780
but playing in front of people.

00:55:33.780 --> 00:55:37.530
Now this is the most
interesting thing.

00:55:37.530 --> 00:55:42.330
Music is a transaction between--
that's what we say in language.

00:55:42.330 --> 00:55:46.225
But it's something
that passes between us.

00:55:46.225 --> 00:55:50.330
You know, they found-- I
read this a year or so ago.

00:55:50.330 --> 00:55:53.090
They found in some caves--
these caves are always

00:55:53.090 --> 00:55:54.830
in France for some reason.

00:55:54.830 --> 00:55:59.310
They found-- they think
it's an instrument.

00:55:59.310 --> 00:56:04.500
They found wings of a pigeon
that were hollowed out,

00:56:04.500 --> 00:56:08.640
and they just thought
that these were

00:56:08.640 --> 00:56:10.130
very early versions of flute.

00:56:10.130 --> 00:56:13.090
70,000 years ago.

00:56:13.090 --> 00:56:16.300
You know, I think that
was the first language.

00:56:16.300 --> 00:56:21.050
Maybe people picked it
up, and they made a song.

00:56:21.050 --> 00:56:25.870
Do you go to-- you
know, I also never miss

00:56:25.870 --> 00:56:31.410
going to one of these
natural history museums

00:56:31.410 --> 00:56:33.760
and going-- I find
them extremely--

00:56:33.760 --> 00:56:36.730
not only to hear, to see what
contemporary people are like

00:56:36.730 --> 00:56:39.300
but to go back in time.

00:56:39.300 --> 00:56:43.570
That's why I really-- Jonathan
spoke about the first city, Ur.

00:56:43.570 --> 00:56:45.500
So interesting for me.

00:56:45.500 --> 00:56:48.870
The thing is that our
humanness, the thing that

00:56:48.870 --> 00:56:54.960
makes us distinct from--
it seems unique, in a way.

00:56:54.960 --> 00:56:56.710
Of course, it's probably
maybe not unique,

00:56:56.710 --> 00:56:58.760
but it strikes us that way.

00:57:02.430 --> 00:57:03.980
It's not just our attachment.

00:57:03.980 --> 00:57:11.400
Even our-- what is the
opposite of attachment?

00:57:11.400 --> 00:57:17.230
We're repelled by certain
activities, certain people.

00:57:17.230 --> 00:57:20.670
Whatever it is, whether
we're attracted to it

00:57:20.670 --> 00:57:22.918
or repelled by it,
it's so strong.

00:57:25.610 --> 00:57:28.370
You know, this is an
interesting thing.

00:57:28.370 --> 00:57:33.210
We talk about the
art of ancient times,

00:57:33.210 --> 00:57:40.360
and we look at-- we can
see the vases from Egypt

00:57:40.360 --> 00:57:50.500
or the pyramids in
Mexico or the clothing

00:57:50.500 --> 00:57:54.620
they find that's left over
from some nomadic people living

00:57:54.620 --> 00:57:59.320
in Siberia or
someplace like that.

00:57:59.320 --> 00:58:04.380
Everything-- I find that
extremely interesting

00:58:04.380 --> 00:58:06.970
and deeply moving,
and I'm not sure why,

00:58:06.970 --> 00:58:09.480
because I don't need
to read about it.

00:58:09.480 --> 00:58:12.180
I just need to be in
the presence of it.

00:58:12.180 --> 00:58:15.260
So in a way, you
say, how do I do it?

00:58:15.260 --> 00:58:16.570
I'm drawn to do it.

00:58:16.570 --> 00:58:21.730
It's my nature to play music,
and I've played it all my life.

00:58:21.730 --> 00:58:25.570
And if I meet someone, if I
have any connection to them

00:58:25.570 --> 00:58:27.130
at all-- they can play music?

00:58:27.130 --> 00:58:30.210
I'll play music with them,
because something happens.

00:58:30.210 --> 00:58:31.282
Isn't that so?

00:58:31.282 --> 00:58:32.120
ARTURO BEJAR: Yeah.

00:58:32.120 --> 00:58:33.470
I've seen that.

00:58:33.470 --> 00:58:39.020
And so coming back to
the festival, what would

00:58:39.020 --> 00:58:40.534
be your vision or your hope?

00:58:40.534 --> 00:58:41.450
PHILIP GLASS: My what?

00:58:41.450 --> 00:58:43.158
ARTURO BEJAR: Vision
or hope around the--

00:58:43.158 --> 00:58:45.960
PHILIP GLASS: I would like--
we're building the festival up.

00:58:45.960 --> 00:58:49.280
This year, Victor Sanchez
has come from Mexico.

00:58:49.280 --> 00:58:54.350
He works in the field of what
we call human development,

00:58:54.350 --> 00:58:55.570
human behavior.

00:58:55.570 --> 00:58:57.730
He has amazing
things that he does.

00:58:57.730 --> 00:59:01.600
He takes people into the
desert or-- and there, we're

00:59:01.600 --> 00:59:12.890
going to go into a number of
national forests in the area.

00:59:12.890 --> 00:59:16.980
Pfeiffer Forest is right
there down there in Big Sur.

00:59:16.980 --> 00:59:20.630
And he goes into-- he goes
in with 10, 20, sometimes

00:59:20.630 --> 00:59:24.607
30 people, and they
can go for a week.

00:59:24.607 --> 00:59:26.440
I think what we're going
to do there-- he'll

00:59:26.440 --> 00:59:29.160
work in the daytime
with a group of people.

00:59:29.160 --> 00:59:33.310
And these are actually
transforming experiences

00:59:33.310 --> 00:59:35.930
because he's spent
his life doing this.

00:59:35.930 --> 00:59:38.830
And he's found out
things in nature

00:59:38.830 --> 00:59:41.990
which you have no
idea what they are.

00:59:41.990 --> 00:59:44.000
I've seen them, because
I've been with him.

00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:47.062
So his coming, he'll
be in the daytime.

00:59:47.062 --> 00:59:48.520
Then we have the
concerts at night.

00:59:48.520 --> 00:59:52.000
And it will be, or
they'll be-- in this case,

00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:55.420
we have a movie of Laurie
Anderson called-- her dog

00:59:55.420 --> 00:59:57.440
movie, wonderful movie.

00:59:57.440 --> 00:59:58.832
And she just made it.

00:59:58.832 --> 01:00:00.790
And then the second night,
I'm doing an evening

01:00:00.790 --> 01:00:02.820
of poetry and music with her.

01:00:02.820 --> 01:00:08.710
Then we have the
Club Diamond, which

01:00:08.710 --> 01:00:14.390
is a small but very
intense and beautiful

01:00:14.390 --> 01:00:18.110
theater piece for one
performer and a musician,

01:00:18.110 --> 01:00:28.470
and based on the activity
of street performers

01:00:28.470 --> 01:00:32.261
in Tokyo who go around
and entertain children,

01:00:32.261 --> 01:00:34.760
and they give them candy, and
they-- they just go from place

01:00:34.760 --> 01:00:35.770
to place and do that.

01:00:35.770 --> 01:00:38.139
And this character is the
character of this piece.

01:00:38.139 --> 01:00:38.930
You have to see it.

01:00:38.930 --> 01:00:40.829
It's really beautiful.

01:00:40.829 --> 01:00:42.620
We're going to have
some music before then,

01:00:42.620 --> 01:00:45.250
but I'm going to get some
music, some younger composers.

01:00:45.250 --> 01:00:53.297
Then the next night, we have
this piece by Jerry Quickley.

01:00:53.297 --> 01:00:54.630
It's called "The Whistleblower."

01:00:54.630 --> 01:00:57.270
It's about--

01:00:57.270 --> 01:00:58.520
ARTURO BEJAR: Edward Snowden--

01:00:58.520 --> 01:00:59.370
PHILIP GLASS: Yeah.

01:00:59.370 --> 01:01:01.180
ARTURO BEJAR: --and the
surveillance state and--

01:01:01.180 --> 01:01:02.680
PHILIP GLASS: Yeah,
the whole thing.

01:01:02.680 --> 01:01:07.260
And it's wildly
funny and touching.

01:01:07.260 --> 01:01:10.337
And it's mixed in with
parts about Allen Ginsberg.

01:01:10.337 --> 01:01:11.920
And now how he did
that, I don't know.

01:01:11.920 --> 01:01:13.970
But he's got Allen in there too.

01:01:13.970 --> 01:01:16.950
ARTURO BEJAR: Yeah, I'll
expand on that a little bit.

01:01:16.950 --> 01:01:19.490
The Allen Ginsberg
piece is written

01:01:19.490 --> 01:01:22.560
from the perspective
of the agent that

01:01:22.560 --> 01:01:25.100
is signed to surveil him.

01:01:25.100 --> 01:01:26.909
And it's derived from
the papers that they

01:01:26.909 --> 01:01:29.450
got published about this agent
that was surveilling Ginsberg.

01:01:29.450 --> 01:01:30.410
And it's amazing.

01:01:30.410 --> 01:01:31.951
PHILIP GLASS: Yeah,
he got the papers

01:01:31.951 --> 01:01:33.600
from the Freedom
of Information Act.

01:01:33.600 --> 01:01:35.330
He got these papers.

01:01:35.330 --> 01:01:38.790
And it becomes the thing.

01:01:38.790 --> 01:01:41.780
And so we have that one.

01:01:41.780 --> 01:01:48.175
So then we'll have some-- and
then Foday Suso will playing.

01:01:48.175 --> 01:01:50.330
I'll be in front.

01:01:50.330 --> 01:01:51.580
We'll be doing a musical.

01:01:51.580 --> 01:02:01.600
We'll be doing-- I think that's
one where I think that our bass

01:02:01.600 --> 01:02:03.420
player will be playing with.

01:02:03.420 --> 01:02:06.380
That's with a string
quartet with Jerry Quickley.

01:02:06.380 --> 01:02:10.190
But I think it will just
be Foday and myself.

01:02:10.190 --> 01:02:11.340
ARTURO BEJAR: Yeah.

01:02:11.340 --> 01:02:15.640
PHILIP GLASS: So it's-- with
a very few handful of people,

01:02:15.640 --> 01:02:20.840
we cover a huge, a very
big area of activity.

01:02:20.840 --> 01:02:21.770
ARTURO BEJAR: Yeah.

01:02:21.770 --> 01:02:24.670
And so, like, if the
festival sounds really cool--

01:02:24.670 --> 01:02:26.920
and I wanted-- if you have
any questions that you want

01:02:26.920 --> 01:02:28.961
to ask him, part of the
goal of coming here today

01:02:28.961 --> 01:02:31.359
is feel free to
ask him anything.

01:02:31.359 --> 01:02:32.900
We still have some
time, and I wanted

01:02:32.900 --> 01:02:34.727
to allow enough time for that.

01:02:34.727 --> 01:02:37.310
But if the idea of the festival
sounds like really interesting

01:02:37.310 --> 01:02:39.290
to you and you want to
be involved or engaged

01:02:39.290 --> 01:02:42.214
in some way, just grab
me when we're done here.

01:02:42.214 --> 01:02:44.130
PHILIP GLASS: You have
some information, yeah.

01:02:44.130 --> 01:02:45.963
ARTURO BEJAR: And we
can take it from there.

01:02:45.963 --> 01:02:48.780
Because I think
it's extraordinary

01:02:48.780 --> 01:02:50.780
that-- like you were
anywhere else in the world,

01:02:50.780 --> 01:02:51.821
you would go to New York.

01:02:51.821 --> 01:02:54.470
And you would perform at
Carnegie Hall, or the Met,

01:02:54.470 --> 01:02:57.820
and you'd come out, do your
thing, and then you'd be out.

01:02:57.820 --> 01:02:59.750
And they'll be waving
from the audience,

01:02:59.750 --> 01:03:01.670
but it would be about it.

01:03:01.670 --> 01:03:06.195
And here there's an opportunity
to be with 100, 200 people,

01:03:06.195 --> 01:03:06.830
and--

01:03:06.830 --> 01:03:08.200
PHILIP GLASS: Maybe 300 of them.

01:03:08.200 --> 01:03:09.780
We're at the Henry
Miller Library,

01:03:09.780 --> 01:03:14.460
which is an outdoor
venue in the Redwoods.

01:03:14.460 --> 01:03:16.050
And it's just very intimate.

01:03:16.050 --> 01:03:20.100
And it probably
could be 300 people.

01:03:20.100 --> 01:03:22.990
He is-- it's legal now for
him to do these concerts.

01:03:22.990 --> 01:03:26.530
But he had to get
some kind of permit

01:03:26.530 --> 01:03:28.180
through the state or something.

01:03:28.180 --> 01:03:31.810
And they're allowing
him 300 people.

01:03:31.810 --> 01:03:33.040
ARTURO BEJAR: OK.

01:03:33.040 --> 01:03:34.600
So does anybody
have any questions

01:03:34.600 --> 01:03:38.840
that they would
like to ask Phil?

01:03:38.840 --> 01:03:41.970
And please, come up
to the microphone.

01:03:41.970 --> 01:03:43.210
AUDIENCE: Hi, how are you?

01:03:43.210 --> 01:03:44.626
Actually, first
question would be,

01:03:44.626 --> 01:03:47.122
when is the Henry Miller show?

01:03:47.122 --> 01:03:49.163
ARTURO BEJAR: The Henry
Miller Memorial Library--

01:03:49.163 --> 01:03:49.950
AUDIENCE: Ah.

01:03:49.950 --> 01:03:50.750
ARTURO BEJAR: --last
weekend of September.

01:03:50.750 --> 01:03:52.080
PHILIP GLASS: It's in Big Sur.

01:03:52.080 --> 01:03:52.330
ARTURO BEJAR: In Big Sur.

01:03:52.330 --> 01:03:53.740
AUDIENCE: Last
weekend-- OK, great.

01:03:53.740 --> 01:03:54.448
I had a question.

01:03:54.448 --> 01:03:55.880
I play music most of my life.

01:03:55.880 --> 01:04:00.740
And it's great to see
someone with such a library

01:04:00.740 --> 01:04:02.756
and done so much.

01:04:02.756 --> 01:04:04.990
And one thing I've
seen, including myself,

01:04:04.990 --> 01:04:09.910
is a lot of people who play
music do it out of passion.

01:04:09.910 --> 01:04:13.310
And then they lose that passion,
or they become uninspired.

01:04:13.310 --> 01:04:15.120
And you spoke a little
earlier about, like,

01:04:15.120 --> 01:04:18.940
someone being inspired is
as simple as a imagining

01:04:18.940 --> 01:04:21.300
a kangaroo running.

01:04:21.300 --> 01:04:24.150
And I was just wondering,
what is your inspiration,

01:04:24.150 --> 01:04:30.140
or how do you continue to find
inspiration in writing music

01:04:30.140 --> 01:04:31.505
throughout your entire life?

01:04:31.505 --> 01:04:33.130
PHILIP GLASS: I didn't
completely hear.

01:04:33.130 --> 01:04:35.955
ARTURO BEJAR: Yeah, so how
do find and keep inspiration

01:04:35.955 --> 01:04:36.830
throughout your life?

01:04:36.830 --> 01:04:38.056
What feeds your creative--

01:04:38.056 --> 01:04:41.770
PHILIP GLASS: Oh, it's my
insane, intense curiosity

01:04:41.770 --> 01:04:44.130
really.

01:04:44.130 --> 01:04:47.270
I find it all so interesting.

01:04:47.270 --> 01:04:50.425
I have no trouble-- I
have trouble sleeping

01:04:50.425 --> 01:04:51.050
in the morning.

01:04:51.050 --> 01:04:53.957
I get up early and start
thinking about this stuff.

01:04:57.860 --> 01:05:01.260
Right now, I'm
working on the music

01:05:01.260 --> 01:05:03.880
for Jerry's piece,
which we're going to be

01:05:03.880 --> 01:05:06.050
starting to rehearse in May.

01:05:06.050 --> 01:05:07.090
So I get up for that.

01:05:07.090 --> 01:05:11.240
And then I'm working on a new
symphony later in the day.

01:05:14.020 --> 01:05:16.700
I don't know.

01:05:16.700 --> 01:05:21.230
I find it very interesting.

01:05:21.230 --> 01:05:25.500
And right now,
there's a movement

01:05:25.500 --> 01:05:30.230
in the world of performance
and music of younger people,

01:05:30.230 --> 01:05:32.660
people in their 20s
and early 30s, that's

01:05:32.660 --> 01:05:34.560
extremely interesting.

01:05:34.560 --> 01:05:36.490
And it's happening--
this happened--

01:05:36.490 --> 01:05:38.960
OK, I can tell you that
many of you don't know this.

01:05:38.960 --> 01:05:44.440
But 60 year ago, when the
McCarthy communist trials

01:05:44.440 --> 01:05:48.010
were going on, at that time,
it was a terrible time.

01:05:48.010 --> 01:05:50.160
It was even as-- it
was as bad as Trump.

01:05:50.160 --> 01:05:51.302
It was really that bad.

01:05:51.302 --> 01:05:52.450
[LAUGHTER]

01:05:52.450 --> 01:05:56.800
I mean, Trump-- McCarthy
was a real-- anyway--

01:05:56.800 --> 01:05:58.540
[LAUGHTER]

01:05:58.540 --> 01:06:05.140
And at that time,
what happened--

01:06:05.140 --> 01:06:07.392
you had Allen Ginsberg
coming around then.

01:06:07.392 --> 01:06:08.850
And then you had
William Burroughs.

01:06:08.850 --> 01:06:15.440
And you had all this-- there was
a sudden explosion of the art,

01:06:15.440 --> 01:06:17.630
of creativity.

01:06:17.630 --> 01:06:21.535
And I began to think, that's
mother nature balancing it.

01:06:21.535 --> 01:06:23.920
You know, you get
some insanity here.

01:06:23.920 --> 01:06:27.660
Then you have to have some art
over here to make it bearable.

01:06:27.660 --> 01:06:29.210
I really believe that's true.

01:06:29.210 --> 01:06:31.650
Now we're in the-- I
don't have to tell you.

01:06:31.650 --> 01:06:33.690
The news, you can
barely watch it.

01:06:33.690 --> 01:06:34.720
It's gotten horrific.

01:06:34.720 --> 01:06:35.710
It's terrible.

01:06:35.710 --> 01:06:39.030
And yet at the same
time, I find young people

01:06:39.030 --> 01:06:44.830
as more idealistic and
committed to self-expression

01:06:44.830 --> 01:06:49.110
and exploration
of their humanity

01:06:49.110 --> 01:06:51.010
than I have seen
in 30 or 40 years.

01:06:51.010 --> 01:06:54.640
It's very, very-- if you--
it's a very, very rich time

01:06:54.640 --> 01:06:59.680
right now for poets, for
musicians, for artists.

01:06:59.680 --> 01:07:02.536
So if you get tired of watching
this junk on television,

01:07:02.536 --> 01:07:03.910
go out and see
some of the stuff.

01:07:03.910 --> 01:07:06.340
It's really-- I'm sure
that you can find it.

01:07:06.340 --> 01:07:07.420
It's all over the place.

01:07:07.420 --> 01:07:10.130
AUDIENCE: I try to fill my life
with that on a daily basis.

01:07:10.130 --> 01:07:10.630
Thank you.

01:07:14.920 --> 01:07:16.070
AUDIENCE: Hi.

01:07:16.070 --> 01:07:18.610
About five years
ago, a friend of mine

01:07:18.610 --> 01:07:21.980
said that she had
just released an album

01:07:21.980 --> 01:07:24.760
of her own compositions.

01:07:24.760 --> 01:07:26.440
And I said, oh, that's nice.

01:07:26.440 --> 01:07:29.520
I've never been able
to compose music.

01:07:29.520 --> 01:07:32.010
And she said, your
best friend just died.

01:07:32.010 --> 01:07:34.900
Go over to the piano
and play something.

01:07:34.900 --> 01:07:36.040
OK.

01:07:36.040 --> 01:07:38.450
And I went over and started
at A minor and something.

01:07:38.450 --> 01:07:40.510
And then it kind of
worked into another key.

01:07:40.510 --> 01:07:42.010
And then it finished.

01:07:42.010 --> 01:07:45.020
And I-- I never experienced
anything like that.

01:07:45.020 --> 01:07:47.720
And since then-- then
my first thought is,

01:07:47.720 --> 01:07:49.120
well, is this really music?

01:07:49.120 --> 01:07:51.070
You know, because I did it.

01:07:51.070 --> 01:07:52.980
But it was, you know, now--

01:07:52.980 --> 01:07:53.980
PHILIP GLASS: Thank you.

01:07:53.980 --> 01:07:55.879
AUDIENCE: --I can
play some things.

01:07:55.879 --> 01:07:58.170
PHILIP GLASS: By the way,
you're the piano tuner right?

01:07:58.170 --> 01:07:58.360
AUDIENCE: Yes.

01:07:58.360 --> 01:08:00.484
PHILIP GLASS: This is the
guy that tuned the piano.

01:08:00.484 --> 01:08:03.720
[APPLAUSE]

01:08:03.720 --> 01:08:05.860
And he told me just
before the concert,

01:08:05.860 --> 01:08:08.490
he said, yeah, I've been
tuning the piano all my life.

01:08:08.490 --> 01:08:10.581
And I've just started
to write music now.

01:08:10.581 --> 01:08:12.291
[LAUGHTER]

01:08:12.291 --> 01:08:12.790
[APPLAUSE]

01:08:12.790 --> 01:08:14.987
PHILIP GLASS: So maybe he'll--

01:08:14.987 --> 01:08:15.820
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

01:08:15.820 --> 01:08:19.246
PHILIP GLASS: Thank
you for your thoughts.

01:08:19.246 --> 01:08:21.620
AUDIENCE: Well, first I want
to thank you for being here.

01:08:21.620 --> 01:08:25.240
You've been sort of one of the
gods of my musical pantheon

01:08:25.240 --> 01:08:29.399
since I first saw [INAUDIBLE]
back in the early '80s

01:08:29.399 --> 01:08:32.649
when it first came out.

01:08:32.649 --> 01:08:34.380
I wanted to know if
you thought about

01:08:34.380 --> 01:08:39.080
or if you've talked
about how the internet

01:08:39.080 --> 01:08:41.859
and the communication
technology we have now and sort

01:08:41.859 --> 01:08:44.970
of the democratizing
out elements of that

01:08:44.970 --> 01:08:49.270
are part of that explosion of
creativity and self-expression

01:08:49.270 --> 01:08:51.794
you had just mentioned.

01:08:51.794 --> 01:08:53.210
PHILIP GLASS: I
didn't quite hear.

01:08:53.210 --> 01:08:54.793
ARTURO BEJAR: So how
does the-- how do

01:08:54.793 --> 01:08:58.790
you think the internet has
democratized and opened up

01:08:58.790 --> 01:09:01.649
creativity?

01:09:01.649 --> 01:09:04.370
PHILIP GLASS: It's
helped me a lot.

01:09:04.370 --> 01:09:07.600
I was writing music
for a play recently.

01:09:07.600 --> 01:09:09.439
I was in the theater.

01:09:09.439 --> 01:09:14.069
And the director said, I need
a song for the end of the play.

01:09:14.069 --> 01:09:17.220
So I-- I was watching--
I wrote the song.

01:09:17.220 --> 01:09:27.770
And I took a picture of it was
my camera, my little, you know,

01:09:27.770 --> 01:09:28.910
iPhone.

01:09:28.910 --> 01:09:33.120
And I sent it on the internet
to my office downtown.

01:09:33.120 --> 01:09:34.290
They took it.

01:09:34.290 --> 01:09:40.029
They turned it into-- a person
down there made a demo from it.

01:09:40.029 --> 01:09:42.670
And a few minutes later,
he sent it up by internet.

01:09:42.670 --> 01:09:49.029
I had a version of the piece
done within about an hour.

01:09:49.029 --> 01:09:50.460
That's the internet for you.

01:09:50.460 --> 01:09:53.399
I mean, you can't knock that.

01:09:53.399 --> 01:09:56.430
And I said, oh,
here's-- I got the song.

01:09:56.430 --> 01:09:58.722
Do you want to give a-- he
said, when did you write it?

01:09:58.722 --> 01:10:00.138
I said, while you
were rehearsing,

01:10:00.138 --> 01:10:01.440
so I just decided to write it.

01:10:01.440 --> 01:10:02.000
[LAUGHTER]

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.030
And he said, do you want
to give it to Ed now?

01:10:04.030 --> 01:10:05.290
He said, well, yeah, yeah.

01:10:05.290 --> 01:10:07.600
We'll give it to-- so
that song ended up--

01:10:07.600 --> 01:10:09.330
so the internet's amazing.

01:10:09.330 --> 01:10:10.300
[LAUGHTER]

01:10:10.300 --> 01:10:12.400
You know, when I
find out-- first

01:10:12.400 --> 01:10:13.780
I thought I had to scan things.

01:10:13.780 --> 01:10:15.571
Then I realized I could
just take a picture

01:10:15.571 --> 01:10:18.140
and send the picture to the--
and someone would put it

01:10:18.140 --> 01:10:19.500
into the computer.

01:10:19.500 --> 01:10:21.660
And amazing, huh?

01:10:21.660 --> 01:10:26.750
So how does it-- I
find it mainly helpful.

01:10:26.750 --> 01:10:29.270
It helps me to--
years ago when I

01:10:29.270 --> 01:10:33.207
was working on a--
I was working on a,

01:10:33.207 --> 01:10:35.290
I think it was "The Hours"
or something like that.

01:10:35.290 --> 01:10:36.650
It was a movie.

01:10:36.650 --> 01:10:41.620
But it was being
recorded in London.

01:10:41.620 --> 01:10:43.449
And the director
called me up-- I

01:10:43.449 --> 01:10:44.990
was living in-- I
was in Nova Scotia.

01:10:44.990 --> 01:10:48.117
He said, I need some changes.

01:10:48.117 --> 01:10:49.450
I need it by tomorrow afternoon.

01:10:49.450 --> 01:10:52.870
I said, Scott, you're not going
to get tomorrow afternoon.

01:10:52.870 --> 01:10:53.725
He said, yes I will.

01:10:53.725 --> 01:10:55.100
I said, what are
you going to do?

01:10:55.100 --> 01:10:58.260
He said, someone's flying
to Halifax right now.

01:10:58.260 --> 01:11:01.270
They'll be at your
door in six hours.

01:11:01.270 --> 01:11:02.150
Do the rewrite.

01:11:02.150 --> 01:11:02.840
Give it to him.

01:11:02.840 --> 01:11:04.006
He'll get back on the plane.

01:11:04.006 --> 01:11:05.650
And I'll have it by
tomorrow afternoon.

01:11:05.650 --> 01:11:07.090
And he did.

01:11:07.090 --> 01:11:08.550
So that was the old days.

01:11:08.550 --> 01:11:12.080
Today, he would just called me
and said, hey send the piece.

01:11:12.080 --> 01:11:14.060
And I would send it by internet.

01:11:14.060 --> 01:11:15.520
It's amazing, huh?

01:11:15.520 --> 01:11:18.110
I was asked, are there any bad--
I guess there are bad things.

01:11:18.110 --> 01:11:19.480
But I tend to--

01:11:19.480 --> 01:11:19.980
[LAUGHTER]

01:11:19.980 --> 01:11:21.840
I tend to look at
the positive stuff.

01:11:21.840 --> 01:11:23.760
And you've probably
gathered that already.

01:11:23.760 --> 01:11:27.040
I tend to look at the
positive sides of things.

01:11:27.040 --> 01:11:28.810
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

01:11:28.810 --> 01:11:30.220
AUDIENCE: Good afternoon.

01:11:30.220 --> 01:11:31.540
My name is Rick.

01:11:31.540 --> 01:11:35.430
I assume decades ago when
you started composing,

01:11:35.430 --> 01:11:40.750
you used paper, pencil,
score sheet, and piano.

01:11:40.750 --> 01:11:45.190
As the decades go by,
technology became available.

01:11:45.190 --> 01:11:47.730
Have you changed your
process to use software?

01:11:47.730 --> 01:11:48.740
PHILIP GLASS: Well, no.

01:11:48.740 --> 01:11:50.690
I still use-- now
what I have to do,

01:11:50.690 --> 01:11:54.090
the people that make the music
paper don't do it anymore.

01:11:54.090 --> 01:11:56.750
But what I found is that their
printers, if you give them

01:11:56.750 --> 01:11:59.230
a sample of what you want,
they'll print it for you.

01:11:59.230 --> 01:12:00.920
I'm still running
with pencil and paper.

01:12:00.920 --> 01:12:01.669
AUDIENCE: You are.

01:12:01.669 --> 01:12:02.910
PHILIP GLASS: I am.

01:12:02.910 --> 01:12:05.230
And then what I have, I
have some young fellows

01:12:05.230 --> 01:12:07.544
that work in the studio for me.

01:12:07.544 --> 01:12:08.960
And they put it
into the computer.

01:12:08.960 --> 01:12:12.050
Once it gets in the computer,
now anybody can deal with it.

01:12:12.050 --> 01:12:15.120
But that the manuscript, no
one can deal with that anymore.

01:12:15.120 --> 01:12:16.600
AUDIENCE: Because
I use software.

01:12:16.600 --> 01:12:18.850
I use technology devices.

01:12:18.850 --> 01:12:21.230
Sometimes I use my
phone for an idea.

01:12:21.230 --> 01:12:23.039
And then I go to the
paper, and you know.

01:12:23.039 --> 01:12:23.830
I'm wondering iff--

01:12:23.830 --> 01:12:25.413
PHILIP GLASS: Well,
you're using both.

01:12:25.413 --> 01:12:29.994
I find that, you
know, at this point,

01:12:29.994 --> 01:12:31.660
my friends say, well,
why don't you just

01:12:31.660 --> 01:12:33.076
learn to write it
into a computer?

01:12:33.076 --> 01:12:35.321
And I-- you know, I
say, well, how long will

01:12:35.321 --> 01:12:36.820
it take me to really
learn to do it?

01:12:36.820 --> 01:12:37.957
They say about six weeks.

01:12:37.957 --> 01:12:39.790
And I said, six weeks--
I can write a string

01:12:39.790 --> 01:12:40.810
quartet in six weeks.

01:12:40.810 --> 01:12:41.971
[LAUGHTER]

01:12:41.971 --> 01:12:44.689
I said, well, what would
you rather me do, write

01:12:44.689 --> 01:12:46.480
a string quartet or to
learn how-- he said,

01:12:46.480 --> 01:12:47.938
no you go write
the string quartet.

01:12:47.938 --> 01:12:48.702
[LAUGHTER]

01:12:48.702 --> 01:12:49.550
[APPLAUSE]

01:12:49.550 --> 01:12:50.800
AUDIENCE: Thank you very much.

01:12:50.800 --> 01:12:52.480
PHILIP GLASS: But,
you know, there's

01:12:52.480 --> 01:12:55.470
another thing about the
manuscript, by the way.

01:12:55.470 --> 01:12:58.550
I've got-- I don't want to tell
you how many thousands of pages

01:12:58.550 --> 01:13:00.470
I've got of manuscript.

01:13:00.470 --> 01:13:04.840
If you write music-- and
you have files, right?

01:13:04.840 --> 01:13:05.964
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:13:05.964 --> 01:13:07.630
PHILIP GLASS: I can
sell my manuscripts.

01:13:07.630 --> 01:13:08.820
You can sell your files.

01:13:08.820 --> 01:13:10.277
[LAUGHTER]

01:13:10.277 --> 01:13:12.360
AUDIENCE: But I can print
and become files, right?

01:13:12.360 --> 01:13:13.490
PHILIP GLASS: Well, OK.

01:13:13.490 --> 01:13:14.700
OK, I'll give you that.

01:13:14.700 --> 01:13:15.820
[LAUGHTER]

01:13:15.820 --> 01:13:17.446
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

01:13:17.446 --> 01:13:19.570
AUDIENCE: Hi, thank you so
much for coming, Philip,

01:13:19.570 --> 01:13:22.350
and amazing performance
of "Mad Rush."

01:13:22.350 --> 01:13:24.420
So Bradley was mentioning
in the beginning of

01:13:24.420 --> 01:13:29.165
to talk about how touched he was
yesterday by the performance.

01:13:29.165 --> 01:13:31.290
And I was very touched by
your performance as well.

01:13:31.290 --> 01:13:32.900
I'm going to
treasure it forever.

01:13:32.900 --> 01:13:35.060
I think we all have
these performances

01:13:35.060 --> 01:13:37.240
that we get to see-- and
it can be something very

01:13:37.240 --> 01:13:39.480
formal like at
Carnegie Hall, or it

01:13:39.480 --> 01:13:42.490
can be somebody playing the
guitar in front of you--

01:13:42.490 --> 01:13:44.930
that we treasure very much.

01:13:44.930 --> 01:13:46.500
And I would like
to ask you, do you

01:13:46.500 --> 01:13:49.010
have one or a few
specific things

01:13:49.010 --> 01:13:51.300
that you witnessed in
music that you would like

01:13:51.300 --> 01:13:52.664
to take with you to eternity?

01:13:52.664 --> 01:13:54.080
PHILIP GLASS: There
are two things

01:13:54.080 --> 01:13:56.080
I saw that were really amazing.

01:13:56.080 --> 01:14:00.770
When I was about 18 or 17
or 18, I was in New York

01:14:00.770 --> 01:14:04.370
and Segovia came to
play at Carnegie Hall.

01:14:04.370 --> 01:14:07.040
Carnegie Hall is
a pretty big hall.

01:14:07.040 --> 01:14:11.020
He sat at the front of
the stage in a chair.

01:14:11.020 --> 01:14:12.520
And he's kind of a little guy.

01:14:12.520 --> 01:14:17.420
He leaned over with the
guitar-- the place was packed--

01:14:17.420 --> 01:14:20.910
and began playing very quietly.

01:14:20.910 --> 01:14:26.440
After about a few minutes,
it filled the room.

01:14:26.440 --> 01:14:28.330
You could hear
every note he did.

01:14:28.330 --> 01:14:33.460
And he sat and just played for
maybe, maybe 75, 80 minutes.

01:14:33.460 --> 01:14:35.680
It was a memorable concert.

01:14:35.680 --> 01:14:39.460
Then I had another memorable
concert about the same time.

01:14:39.460 --> 01:14:44.090
I was at the Village
Vanguard in New York.

01:14:44.090 --> 01:14:47.800
And John Coltrane was
playing with a band.

01:14:47.800 --> 01:14:53.134
And he was playing insanely
good, beautiful music.

01:14:53.134 --> 01:14:54.550
But you know how
a band will come.

01:14:54.550 --> 01:14:56.540
They'll come-- it
was break time.

01:14:56.540 --> 01:14:59.130
So the band stopped, and
they went to the bar.

01:14:59.130 --> 01:15:00.700
John Coltrane just kept playing.

01:15:00.700 --> 01:15:02.620
He played straight
through the break.

01:15:02.620 --> 01:15:04.915
He was still playing--
he was still playing

01:15:04.915 --> 01:15:06.921
the changes in everything.

01:15:06.921 --> 01:15:08.170
They came back from the break.

01:15:08.170 --> 01:15:09.030
They picked up
their instruments.

01:15:09.030 --> 01:15:10.529
And they just started
playing again.

01:15:10.529 --> 01:15:11.230
[LAUGHTER]

01:15:11.230 --> 01:15:13.460
He never stopped,
I said, oh boy,

01:15:13.460 --> 01:15:15.440
that's-- that's a monster--

01:15:15.440 --> 01:15:17.130
[LAUGHTER]

01:15:17.130 --> 01:15:18.667
PHILIP GLASS: --a
monster talent.

01:15:18.667 --> 01:15:19.500
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

01:15:19.500 --> 01:15:20.180
ARTURO BEJAR: Thank you.

01:15:20.180 --> 01:15:20.940
Yes?

01:15:20.940 --> 01:15:21.860
AUDIENCE: Hi there.

01:15:21.860 --> 01:15:23.880
So you told a
story earlier about

01:15:23.880 --> 01:15:26.330
when you were playing
with a musician who

01:15:26.330 --> 01:15:29.850
played the gourd harp,
and how the tuning was

01:15:29.850 --> 01:15:32.835
very different from your piano
and sort of the consonances

01:15:32.835 --> 01:15:36.220
that you're used to, and that
you didn't tune your piano

01:15:36.220 --> 01:15:37.100
to adjust to him.

01:15:37.100 --> 01:15:39.320
And he adjusted to you.

01:15:39.320 --> 01:15:43.310
Have you ever had to
adjust to another tuning

01:15:43.310 --> 01:15:46.050
system in a
collaboration and really

01:15:46.050 --> 01:15:49.290
had to internalize what
they consider consonances

01:15:49.290 --> 01:15:51.140
as we might consider
dissonances?

01:15:51.140 --> 01:15:56.400
And if so, what was your
experience with that?

01:15:56.400 --> 01:15:58.110
PHILIP GLASS: Well, I haven't.

01:15:58.110 --> 01:16:04.910
When I work with people,
mostly the people who

01:16:04.910 --> 01:16:06.780
have been-- they
might be Indian,

01:16:06.780 --> 01:16:17.480
or from Africa, or maybe from
Australia-- the Australian,

01:16:17.480 --> 01:16:22.950
that guy, in order
to change keys,

01:16:22.950 --> 01:16:27.260
he had a-- he had another
instrument with him.

01:16:27.260 --> 01:16:31.280
He couldn't just cut off part
of it, or he wasn't willing to.

01:16:31.280 --> 01:16:34.280
Mostly, it's just the way it is.

01:16:34.280 --> 01:16:36.894
I mean, we have all-- they're
over here where we are.

01:16:36.894 --> 01:16:38.560
We've got all these
instruments playing.

01:16:38.560 --> 01:16:42.320
So for six or eight of
us to change our tuning

01:16:42.320 --> 01:16:44.404
and there's one guy
who's out of tune-- well,

01:16:44.404 --> 01:16:45.570
he's not really out of tune.

01:16:45.570 --> 01:16:47.080
He's playing in his own tuning.

01:16:47.080 --> 01:16:48.829
It's easier for him
to change than for us.

01:16:48.829 --> 01:16:50.160
And we usually do it that way.

01:16:50.160 --> 01:16:53.810
I haven't had to do that.

01:16:53.810 --> 01:16:56.020
ARTURO BEJAR: Yeah, but
separate from tuning,

01:16:56.020 --> 01:16:58.280
like I thought
when I've heard you

01:16:58.280 --> 01:17:01.919
talk about when you first got
exposed to [INAUDIBLE] music.

01:17:01.919 --> 01:17:02.710
PHILIP GLASS: Yeah.

01:17:02.710 --> 01:17:04.543
ARTURO BEJAR: And you
were trying to notate,

01:17:04.543 --> 01:17:05.890
and you kept getting it-- they--

01:17:05.890 --> 01:17:07.540
PHILIP GLASS: Well,
that's different.

01:17:07.540 --> 01:17:11.910
I had problems with
the rhythmic structure.

01:17:11.910 --> 01:17:15.060
This wasn't about the tuning.

01:17:15.060 --> 01:17:16.260
I could write them.

01:17:16.260 --> 01:17:20.870
Because [INAUDIBLE],
he-- I asked him

01:17:20.870 --> 01:17:21.870
what he was going to do.

01:17:21.870 --> 01:17:23.830
He said, well, I'm going to play
[INAUDIBLE] which is usually

01:17:23.830 --> 01:17:24.350
in F sharp.

01:17:24.350 --> 01:17:26.350
But I'm going to play it
down half a step enough

01:17:26.350 --> 01:17:27.542
for everybody else.

01:17:27.542 --> 01:17:28.500
And that's what he did.

01:17:28.500 --> 01:17:30.160
So it made it very easy for us.

01:17:30.160 --> 01:17:33.010
But I was writing
down the music.

01:17:33.010 --> 01:17:39.660
And Alla Rahka, the tabla
player said, no, the accents

01:17:39.660 --> 01:17:41.675
are in the wrong
place, the wrong place,

01:17:41.675 --> 01:17:42.800
they're in the wrong place.

01:17:42.800 --> 01:17:45.150
And I didn't know what he meant.

01:17:45.150 --> 01:17:48.260
So I would try and write it
out again in a different way.

01:17:48.260 --> 01:17:49.710
And he said, no.

01:17:49.710 --> 01:17:53.350
And he says, the
notes are the same.

01:17:53.350 --> 01:17:54.890
Well, the notes are the same.

01:17:54.890 --> 01:17:57.400
I don't know what the
hell he was talking about.

01:17:57.400 --> 01:18:01.080
It was the first
morning of our collab.

01:18:01.080 --> 01:18:02.820
You know, I was hired
for that morning.

01:18:02.820 --> 01:18:04.830
And I couldn't
afford to get fired.

01:18:04.830 --> 01:18:10.160
I was living on a very
small fellowship in Paris.

01:18:10.160 --> 01:18:13.930
And I knew I was-- I had
to solve this problem.

01:18:13.930 --> 01:18:17.240
And it's nothing like--
it was like, I say,

01:18:17.240 --> 01:18:20.000
I think I've got an
execution to focus the mind.

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.600
So my execution would
have been if I got fired.

01:18:22.600 --> 01:18:25.210
And I looked at the music paper.

01:18:25.210 --> 01:18:27.180
And I did an inspiring thing.

01:18:27.180 --> 01:18:31.170
I took my eraser, and I
erased all the bar lines.

01:18:31.170 --> 01:18:32.860
And I looked at it again.

01:18:32.860 --> 01:18:36.460
And I saw a string of notes.

01:18:36.460 --> 01:18:40.800
And I looked at it, and now I
saw groups of twos and threes.

01:18:40.800 --> 01:18:42.600
I didn't see the
bar lines anymore.

01:18:42.600 --> 01:18:46.270
I saw three, three, two, two,
two, three, three, two, two.

01:18:46.270 --> 01:18:49.210
And I realized, just
by looking at it.

01:18:49.210 --> 01:18:51.150
And I saw that--
I don't know how

01:18:51.150 --> 01:18:52.510
I did this very, very quickly.

01:18:52.510 --> 01:18:58.580
I saw that the first
four or five notes,

01:18:58.580 --> 01:19:00.480
they would add up to 16.

01:19:00.480 --> 01:19:01.476
The second was 16.

01:19:01.476 --> 01:19:02.530
The third one was 16.

01:19:02.530 --> 01:19:06.450
And I saw that there
was a larger group of 16

01:19:06.450 --> 01:19:09.660
that all the threes
and twos fit into.

01:19:09.660 --> 01:19:11.770
And so I just put
the bar line there.

01:19:11.770 --> 01:19:12.880
And I said, what's this?

01:19:12.880 --> 01:19:15.870
And he said, oh,
that's called the tal.

01:19:15.870 --> 01:19:20.100
And the tal just means the
length, the length of the--

01:19:20.100 --> 01:19:22.420
and I found out later
that it could be 14 beats.

01:19:22.420 --> 01:19:23.690
It could be 17 beats.

01:19:23.690 --> 01:19:26.490
It could be 8 beats.

01:19:26.490 --> 01:19:31.200
But the music have to follow
that all the way through.

01:19:31.200 --> 01:19:33.060
And then I found
out also later--

01:19:33.060 --> 01:19:35.190
I didn't know this at
the time-- that when

01:19:35.190 --> 01:19:38.630
they play the first beat,
they call that the som.

01:19:38.630 --> 01:19:43.730
Now when the sitar player was
playing with the tabla player,

01:19:43.730 --> 01:19:48.120
sometimes they would
be together at the som.

01:19:48.120 --> 01:19:49.660
But sometimes they
would purposely

01:19:49.660 --> 01:19:52.830
miss the som for
two or three cycles.

01:19:52.830 --> 01:19:56.730
And if you were in the audience,
the audience was like this.

01:19:56.730 --> 01:19:58.410
They're getting very nervous.

01:19:58.410 --> 01:19:59.925
And finally, they
came to the som.

01:19:59.925 --> 01:20:01.520
And they go, [SIGH].

01:20:01.520 --> 01:20:03.631
[LAUGHTER]

01:20:03.631 --> 01:20:04.880
It was the most amazing thing.

01:20:04.880 --> 01:20:07.080
This was in China.

01:20:07.080 --> 01:20:10.960
It was a madras at the time
when I first saw this happen.

01:20:10.960 --> 01:20:13.790
And the whole audience just
went-- when everyone hit.

01:20:13.790 --> 01:20:17.670
But so the play of
the music had to do

01:20:17.670 --> 01:20:22.880
with the length of the rhythm,
not with the key of the piece.

01:20:22.880 --> 01:20:25.700
You know, in Western
music, the tension

01:20:25.700 --> 01:20:34.961
is between the tonality and
the-- between the harmony

01:20:34.961 --> 01:20:35.585
and the melody.

01:20:35.585 --> 01:20:38.810
I'll put it that way.

01:20:38.810 --> 01:20:42.910
For traditional rhythmic music,
it's mostly just decorative,

01:20:42.910 --> 01:20:44.400
really.

01:20:44.400 --> 01:20:48.670
And in Indian music, the
tension was completely

01:20:48.670 --> 01:20:53.460
between the rhythm
and the vocal line.

01:20:53.460 --> 01:20:55.760
There was no harmony.

01:20:55.760 --> 01:21:01.796
But I was really--
thinking back on it,

01:21:01.796 --> 01:21:04.490
that probably changed my life,
the fact that I figured that.

01:21:04.490 --> 01:21:05.700
I don't even know how I did.

01:21:05.700 --> 01:21:07.275
It was just luck
in a certain way.

01:21:09.820 --> 01:21:11.840
If I had got--
because after that,

01:21:11.840 --> 01:21:14.420
I stayed with Ravi for
the rest of that week.

01:21:14.420 --> 01:21:15.760
And I began working with him.

01:21:15.760 --> 01:21:19.610
And later on, I
played music with him.

01:21:19.610 --> 01:21:24.940
So it became-- it opened up a
whole world of music for me.

01:21:24.940 --> 01:21:28.520
Had I missed that moment,
I would've been fired.

01:21:28.520 --> 01:21:30.880
And I wouldn't be-- I'll
be teaching counterpoint

01:21:30.880 --> 01:21:34.025
in some jerk work conservatory
in Ohio or someplace.

01:21:34.025 --> 01:21:36.311
[LAUGHTER]

01:21:36.311 --> 01:21:37.310
ARTURO BEJAR: Thank you.

01:21:37.310 --> 01:21:38.040
AUDIENCE: That sounds awesome.

01:21:38.040 --> 01:21:38.771
Thank you.

01:21:43.050 --> 01:21:45.960
AUDIENCE: I'm trying to
figure out how to phrase this.

01:21:45.960 --> 01:21:49.080
So you write a piece of music,
people perform it, right?

01:21:49.080 --> 01:21:50.460
We have pieces of music.

01:21:50.460 --> 01:21:53.220
And that's been going on
for quite a long time.

01:21:53.220 --> 01:21:55.880
But there's this
modern phenomenon

01:21:55.880 --> 01:21:59.230
of mashing up and
re-mixing, which

01:21:59.230 --> 01:22:01.620
seems to be throwing
all of that for a loop.

01:22:01.620 --> 01:22:04.210
People write lots of
tiny pits of music.

01:22:04.210 --> 01:22:05.384
People perform by--

01:22:05.384 --> 01:22:06.240
PHILIP GLASS: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:22:06.240 --> 01:22:07.415
AUDIENCE: What do
you think of that?

01:22:07.415 --> 01:22:08.572
It seems to be changing--

01:22:08.572 --> 01:22:11.290
PHILIP GLASS: I
actually encourage it.

01:22:11.290 --> 01:22:13.950
When someone other-- we have
a record that we put out

01:22:13.950 --> 01:22:17.200
on our record company
where we had people do

01:22:17.200 --> 01:22:18.767
covers of pieces of mine.

01:22:18.767 --> 01:22:19.350
AUDIENCE: Mhm.

01:22:19.350 --> 01:22:21.500
PHILIP GLASS: They did
exactly what you're saying.

01:22:21.500 --> 01:22:21.850
AUDIENCE: Right.

01:22:21.850 --> 01:22:23.470
PHILIP GLASS: They-- and
I said, oh, you know,

01:22:23.470 --> 01:22:24.303
I wrote it that way.

01:22:24.303 --> 01:22:27.100
But let me hear what someone
else thinks about it.

01:22:27.100 --> 01:22:29.600
I was always interested
in what they did.

01:22:29.600 --> 01:22:31.110
Now, that's not always true.

01:22:31.110 --> 01:22:34.024
I just had a conversation
with a conductor who

01:22:34.024 --> 01:22:35.440
was looking at a
new piece of mine

01:22:35.440 --> 01:22:37.400
for two pianos and an orchestra.

01:22:37.400 --> 01:22:39.180
It's a double piano concerto.

01:22:39.180 --> 01:22:42.050
He said, well, I'm going
to the rehearsal tomorrow.

01:22:42.050 --> 01:22:48.620
But I have to tell you that I
think the writing is much too

01:22:48.620 --> 01:22:49.950
thick for the orchestra.

01:22:49.950 --> 01:22:53.554
I said, yeah-- I
said, Dennis, that's

01:22:53.554 --> 01:22:54.720
what I'm writing these days.

01:22:54.720 --> 01:22:57.110
I'm writing very dense music.

01:22:57.110 --> 01:23:00.430
I said, look, if you want to,
just thin it out if you want.

01:23:00.430 --> 01:23:01.930
You can play it any
way you want to.

01:23:01.930 --> 01:23:03.410
It's not going to bother me.

01:23:03.410 --> 01:23:04.600
Of course, when I was
thinking to myself,

01:23:04.600 --> 01:23:06.860
I'll just put the music
right back afterwards anyway.

01:23:06.860 --> 01:23:07.620
[LAUGHTER]

01:23:07.620 --> 01:23:08.880
It wasn't going to change it.

01:23:08.880 --> 01:23:13.550
But I said, if it makes you
happy to do it that way,

01:23:13.550 --> 01:23:15.330
just go ahead and do it.

01:23:15.330 --> 01:23:17.400
And he called me
up the next day.

01:23:17.400 --> 01:23:19.500
And he said, well,
we tried it out.

01:23:19.500 --> 01:23:21.260
I tried it out with
your orchestration,

01:23:21.260 --> 01:23:22.460
and it sounded great.

01:23:22.460 --> 01:23:25.602
He said-- it was the first time
this guy had ever said to me--

01:23:25.602 --> 01:23:27.310
he said, I was wrong,
and you were right.

01:23:27.310 --> 01:23:28.380
He never had said that.

01:23:28.380 --> 01:23:30.780
He's been playing music of
mine for 30 years-- first time

01:23:30.780 --> 01:23:32.570
he said, no, you were right.

01:23:32.570 --> 01:23:37.000
And I said-- I said this before,
maybe yesterday-- what happens

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.890
is that you begin to
hear music differently.

01:23:39.890 --> 01:23:43.750
Now if I can hear
it differently,

01:23:43.750 --> 01:23:46.920
so I hear-- what sounds
right to me sounds different.

01:23:46.920 --> 01:23:48.894
I'm not even sure why that is.

01:23:48.894 --> 01:23:53.610
The neurologists say that the
brain continues to evolve,

01:23:53.610 --> 01:23:54.680
you know?

01:23:54.680 --> 01:23:56.590
Or does it devolve?

01:23:56.590 --> 01:23:57.790
I don't know.

01:23:57.790 --> 01:24:01.770
But I find that I hear--
I'm actually hearing things

01:24:01.770 --> 01:24:02.290
differently.

01:24:02.290 --> 01:24:04.530
And I'm writing different music.

01:24:04.530 --> 01:24:07.980
And I don't know why, except
things sound right to me

01:24:07.980 --> 01:24:09.640
that didn't sound
right to me before.

01:24:09.640 --> 01:24:10.730
And I write them down.

01:24:10.730 --> 01:24:12.688
And I make everyone play
it the way I wrote it.

01:24:12.688 --> 01:24:14.170
[LAUGHTER]

01:24:14.170 --> 01:24:18.520
And people who know
the music very well

01:24:18.520 --> 01:24:19.480
will try to correct it.

01:24:19.480 --> 01:24:20.920
And I say-- they
said, this is wrong.

01:24:20.920 --> 01:24:22.211
And I said, no, it's not wrong.

01:24:22.211 --> 01:24:23.430
Just play the way I wrote it.

01:24:23.430 --> 01:24:29.247
But apart from that,
a lot of people

01:24:29.247 --> 01:24:31.580
make arrangements, like a
flutist will make arrangements

01:24:31.580 --> 01:24:33.038
of a violin concerto,
because there

01:24:33.038 --> 01:24:36.010
is no-- they haven't
written a flute concerto.

01:24:36.010 --> 01:24:38.840
Or someone will take
a piece for orchestra

01:24:38.840 --> 01:24:41.680
and they'll play it with
a smaller orchestra.

01:24:41.680 --> 01:24:44.480
And they'll say,
what do you think?

01:24:44.480 --> 01:24:48.110
And I say, well, I think,
if you make an arrangement,

01:24:48.110 --> 01:24:49.960
I want a copy of it.

01:24:49.960 --> 01:24:51.980
And it will belong
to my company.

01:24:51.980 --> 01:24:54.870
And we'll rent it out to
other people if it's good.

01:24:54.870 --> 01:24:57.450
And if it isn't
good, I won't use it.

01:24:57.450 --> 01:25:00.200
Well, I don't really-- the same
thing with dance companies,

01:25:00.200 --> 01:25:01.880
and they want to take
a piece of music.

01:25:01.880 --> 01:25:03.880
They said, do you want
to see our company dance?

01:25:03.880 --> 01:25:04.700
I said, hell no.

01:25:04.700 --> 01:25:06.437
Just take the music,
and do the dance.

01:25:06.437 --> 01:25:08.770
What am I going to do, tell
them I don't like the dance?

01:25:08.770 --> 01:25:09.460
[LAUGHTER]

01:25:09.460 --> 01:25:10.820
What do I know about dance?

01:25:10.820 --> 01:25:16.450
So I'm actually more interested
in what other people think,

01:25:16.450 --> 01:25:19.190
except when it's a
new piece and I'm

01:25:19.190 --> 01:25:21.720
worrying-- I'm
working on language,

01:25:21.720 --> 01:25:26.360
then I want to hear--
I'm very obsessed right

01:25:26.360 --> 01:25:28.760
now with a different
language in my music.

01:25:28.760 --> 01:25:30.800
That's happened in the
last two or three years.

01:25:30.800 --> 01:25:32.650
I can see that is happening.

01:25:32.650 --> 01:25:35.620
And a cellist friend of mine
was playing a [INAUDIBLE]

01:25:35.620 --> 01:25:37.200
I wrote for the solo cello.

01:25:37.200 --> 01:25:38.660
And I went to hear
the recording.

01:25:38.660 --> 01:25:40.840
And it took them
hours to record.

01:25:46.350 --> 01:25:49.460
It took him really about an
hour or two just to record it.

01:25:49.460 --> 01:25:54.134
I said, what do you think?

01:25:54.134 --> 01:25:55.800
I said, Matt, what
do you think of this?

01:25:55.800 --> 01:25:58.865
He said, well it's an
amazing piece of music.

01:25:58.865 --> 01:26:00.990
I said, yeah, but who the
hell is going to play it?

01:26:00.990 --> 01:26:04.169
He said, oh, people
will play it.

01:26:04.169 --> 01:26:06.460
He said, they'll learn to
play it, and they'll play it.

01:26:06.460 --> 01:26:08.150
And that's probably true.

01:26:08.150 --> 01:26:11.060
Now, but is that a good idea?

01:26:11.060 --> 01:26:13.150
I don't know.

01:26:13.150 --> 01:26:16.710
I don't know the
answer to these things.

01:26:16.710 --> 01:26:20.020
In many ways,
I'm-- in many ways,

01:26:20.020 --> 01:26:23.280
after the moment of writing,
I'm just another listener.

01:26:23.280 --> 01:26:25.640
It depends whether I still
got my composer hat on.

01:26:25.640 --> 01:26:29.300
If my composer hat isn't on, I
don't hear it that way anymore.

01:26:29.300 --> 01:26:32.510
And I'm very open
to different things.

01:26:32.510 --> 01:26:34.030
I rarely tell
people that they've

01:26:34.030 --> 01:26:36.965
done it wrong unless they've
actually done it wrong.

01:26:36.965 --> 01:26:38.330
[LAUGHTER]

01:26:38.330 --> 01:26:39.630
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

01:26:39.630 --> 01:26:42.789
MALE SPEAKER: Unfortunately--
is this a yes/no question?

01:26:42.789 --> 01:26:43.830
AUDIENCE: It's a little--

01:26:43.830 --> 01:26:45.800
MALE SPEAKER: If it's a short
question with a short answer,

01:26:45.800 --> 01:26:46.660
we can do this.

01:26:46.660 --> 01:26:47.780
PHILIP GLASS: The short
answer is the hard part.

01:26:47.780 --> 01:26:48.580
Sorry about that.

01:26:48.580 --> 01:26:49.340
AUDIENCE: I'm not
going to say that.

01:26:49.340 --> 01:26:51.710
But the answer doesn't
depend on me, I guess.

01:26:51.710 --> 01:26:55.160
I'm just kind of curious
about the creative process,

01:26:55.160 --> 01:26:56.760
your creative
process in general.

01:26:56.760 --> 01:26:57.700
[LAUGHTER]

01:26:57.700 --> 01:26:59.007
Can I?

01:26:59.007 --> 01:27:00.340
MALE SPEAKER: The answer is yes.

01:27:00.340 --> 01:27:02.590
[LAUGHTER]

01:27:02.590 --> 01:27:05.470
AUDIENCE: So one thing I
find amazing and fascinating

01:27:05.470 --> 01:27:10.470
about music is how-- you know,
I've heard analysis of pieces

01:27:10.470 --> 01:27:12.410
by Chopin, Beethoven,
where there's

01:27:12.410 --> 01:27:17.310
this small motif of three,
four notes that-- you know,

01:27:17.310 --> 01:27:21.620
it's gradually generates the
whole entirety of a piece.

01:27:21.620 --> 01:27:26.080
And I find it
absolutely incredible

01:27:26.080 --> 01:27:28.600
how that process can come
up, how the process works

01:27:28.600 --> 01:27:30.480
to come up with
that piece, yet you

01:27:30.480 --> 01:27:33.510
have these little repetitive
motifs from beginning to end.

01:27:33.510 --> 01:27:35.200
And I wonder, how do you do it?

01:27:35.200 --> 01:27:36.094
What your process?

01:27:36.094 --> 01:27:37.260
Do you start with the whole?

01:27:37.260 --> 01:27:39.990
Do you start with some
melodies, with some small idea?

01:27:39.990 --> 01:27:41.698
PHILIP GLASS: It can
be anything, really.

01:27:41.698 --> 01:27:44.079
But a lot of it is detail.

01:27:44.079 --> 01:27:46.120
I was watching my-- I have
a 14-year-old son that

01:27:46.120 --> 01:27:48.260
was drawing a drawing
the other day.

01:27:48.260 --> 01:27:52.480
And he was doing the
tiniest little lines.

01:27:52.480 --> 01:27:55.570
He just took his time and
just put all the lines

01:27:55.570 --> 01:27:56.860
that he wanted to.

01:27:56.860 --> 01:28:00.240
And he-- I could
see he was getting

01:28:00.240 --> 01:28:02.550
obsessed with some detail.

01:28:02.550 --> 01:28:04.490
And that happens in music too.

01:28:04.490 --> 01:28:07.530
And now, particularly,
I'll write a piece.

01:28:07.530 --> 01:28:08.549
And I'll write music.

01:28:08.549 --> 01:28:10.715
And I'll hear it the next--
I'll go back and play it

01:28:10.715 --> 01:28:12.150
the next day.

01:28:12.150 --> 01:28:14.607
I'll play it on the
piano or look at it.

01:28:14.607 --> 01:28:15.940
And I'm not sure I got it right.

01:28:15.940 --> 01:28:18.590
The problem is that
I hear it right.

01:28:18.590 --> 01:28:21.960
And the biggest problem is, am
I writing down what I heard?

01:28:21.960 --> 01:28:24.650
And once I write it down,
I'm not sure anymore.

01:28:24.650 --> 01:28:28.230
Because the evidence
of the written music

01:28:28.230 --> 01:28:31.899
can be compelling, but
it might not be correct.

01:28:31.899 --> 01:28:33.690
And one of the biggest
problems that I have

01:28:33.690 --> 01:28:35.430
is, am I writing
down what I hear?

01:28:35.430 --> 01:28:36.800
And I'm not sure.

01:28:36.800 --> 01:28:38.120
I do my best.

01:28:38.120 --> 01:28:39.980
I think everyone has a problem.

01:28:39.980 --> 01:28:43.020
I hear-- I listen to the
"Grosse Fuge" of Beethoven.

01:28:43.020 --> 01:28:46.190
I'm not sure of
some of those notes.

01:28:46.190 --> 01:28:47.890
Maybe he didn't
hear them either.

01:28:47.890 --> 01:28:48.440
I don't know.

01:28:48.440 --> 01:28:50.648
But you hear that in other
people's music, don't you?

01:28:50.648 --> 01:28:53.520
Or are you a musician?
