00:00:08.865 --> 00:00:11.455
From the studio that made a movie about a bee

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.740
in an interspecies relationship with a lady,

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.940
comes a fantasy adventure so solid

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:17.820
it will almost make you forget

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.760
Dreamworks made a movie where a bee falls in love with a lady

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:23.820
I mean, he's a bee !

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:24.800
And she's a lady !

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.400
How is that supposed to even work ?

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.420
It's physically impo-

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:28.000
Wait.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.380
What movie were we talking about again ?

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.820
How To Train Your Dragon 1 and 2

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.580
Visit the magical land of Berk

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:37.800
A place full of happy vikings

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.400
and happy dragons,

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:40.800
and when they team up,

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.800
you can assume they'll bring untold pain and carnage to the rest of the world

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.200
So let's turn the ??? back to family-friendly

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.540
to experience the saga, the unlikely hero :

00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:59.380
Hiccup

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:01.880
He didn't inherit his father's viking strength

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.980
or his viking... scottish accent ?

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.600
But he's got more

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.560
 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:23.740
 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:26.200
Still funnier than Funny People

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.020
Everything will change when he meets Toothless

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.840
a dragon crossed with all your favorite cat videos

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.980
They'll prove that working together makes people stronger

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:39.620
and their friendship will transforms Berk

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:41.620
from a land that used to hate and fear dragons

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:44.280
to one that uses them for Quidditch or something

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.420
I mean, progress is progress, right ?

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:48.420
Meh, whatever

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:49.440
Look how cute he is !

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.940
Aw

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:56.500
Strap in as Hiccup teams up with his pals: Astrid and the Warriors 4

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.000
Who even have less character development than ? and the Warriors 3

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.700
Like the boy one,

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:02.700
the nerd one,

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.000
the other girl one,

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.500
and the other boy one

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.100
Man, what a waste of Jonah Hill

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:09.500
Where is that Mc'lovin?

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:10.500
Its hard to say

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.600
Together that'll take you deeper into the world of dragons

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.415
Whether its discovering that dragons are all drones serving a bigger dragon

00:02:17.465 --> 00:02:20.500
Or, that dragons are all drones serving a bigger dragon

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:27.000
Or, that bigger dragons can fight over who gets to make dragons into drones serving of bigger dragons

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.500
Huh, there's actually very little dragon training in the entire franchise

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:38.500
Then again, how to prevent the submission of your dragon to the will of a homicidal apex predator doesn't have quite the same ring to it

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.500
So if you want a fantasy series for all ages

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:45.500
That swaps out Dreamwork's usual pop-culture references for some actual heart

00:02:45.585 --> 00:02:48.875
Make sure to check out some of the best modern fantasy movies today,

00:02:49.075 --> 00:02:51.100
That aren't most of the Harry Potter movies

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.100
Or Lord of the Rings

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.100
Or terrible

00:02:55.105 --> 00:02:58.520
How to Train Your Dragon! It's the best of whats left!

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:00.200
Starring

The Boy With The Dragon How-To

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.500
This Is... Scotland ?

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.060
No Arm-ie Hammer

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.440
Lydia

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:10.000
Dragonforce

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:11.540

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.140
Yawn Snow

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:16.280
And

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:23.000
Dragon Bawl Me

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.840
*cries and hiccups*

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.200
I'm gonna need a second

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:31.380
How To Prevent The Submission Of Your Dragon To The Will Of A Homicidal Apex Predator

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:32.800
See ? Not catchy

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.840
Very true, T.J Miller, very true

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:44.860
 

00:03:45.495 --> 00:03:48.085
 

00:03:48.215 --> 00:03:51.125
 

00:03:51.125 --> 00:03:53.405
 

00:03:54.445 --> 00:03:57.345
 

00:03:57.855 --> 00:03:59.925
