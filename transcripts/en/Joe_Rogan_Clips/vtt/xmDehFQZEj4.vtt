00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:05.990
The Joe Rogan experience and it helped me actually develop this one piece that I

2
00:00:06.091 --> 00:00:11.091
was doing and that be like sort of around it rounded out this one piece I was

3
00:00:11.491 --> 00:00:14.820
doing because I was trying to figure out a way that I could explain it to

4
00:00:14.821 --> 00:00:19.140
someone who might have a preconceived notion about who I am,

5
00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.300
like the,
to to say it in a way that makes people that were hesitant,

6
00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:26.670
laugh,
you know what I mean?

7
00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.730
Versus savages at 1130 on a Saturday night that are hammered [inaudible] yeah.

8
00:00:33.691 --> 00:00:37.350
So Whitney Cummings crowd wasn't a into your antifeminist laughed.

9
00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.560
They laughed because the punchline was good and I,

10
00:00:39.561 --> 00:00:44.010
I had a place to go with it and the place to go was ultimately mocking men's

11
00:00:44.011 --> 00:00:48.890
rights activists.
That was the,
the,
the real thing was the,
the,

12
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:52.950
this,
the setup for that joke is,
I don't like anybody's into one thing and I go,

13
00:00:52.951 --> 00:00:56.700
but what tries to be the most fucking crazy is men's rights activists.

14
00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.610
Like every men's rights activists I ever met.
I just want to grab them and go,

15
00:00:59.611 --> 00:01:03.900
dude,
we got them all.
Yeah.
We've got all the rights.
Yeah,
we got them all.

16
00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.470
I can't believe that's a real thing.
Men's rights activists.
What's a real thing?

17
00:01:07.471 --> 00:01:11.700
If you get divorced and you have child,
uh,
it's a for child custody,

18
00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.760
those things or do those things are real.
Like guys really,

19
00:01:14.761 --> 00:01:19.761
I know men who have gotten really fucked over in divorce where their wife hired

20
00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.660
a fucking killer lawyer and they drag them through.
See the thing about,

21
00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.590
and I learned this from Phil Hartman,
unfortunately before he died,
uh,

22
00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.940
I was trying to tell him to get divorced and I said,
just give her half man,

23
00:01:32.941 --> 00:01:36.360
you'll make more money.
He goes,
it's not half.
He goes,
it's two thirds.

24
00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.020
He goes to fucking lawyers,
take a third.
It's got damn scam.
You know,
he like,

25
00:01:40.021 --> 00:01:43.320
he was furious about it because apparently he had been trying to figure it out,

26
00:01:43.321 --> 00:01:46.860
like how to do it.
But I had a friend whose wife,

27
00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:51.980
ex wife dragged it out on purpose because she wanted him to pay the legal bills.

28
00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.840
So he had to pay for her lawyer.

29
00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:00.170
He had a pay for his lawyer and then he had to pay for all of the Times that she

30
00:02:02.911 --> 00:02:07.130
decided to change the goal posts and mu and renegotiate like just no,

31
00:02:07.131 --> 00:02:09.810
no one can say that you can't renegotiate.

32
00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.830
So she would just renegotiate and just drag things out.
And her,

33
00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.580
her goal was to try to drain him financially.

34
00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.900
So she was doing this on purpose,
like targeting.

35
00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.880
So he was essentially paying for the general of the army that was plotting to

36
00:02:25.881 --> 00:02:26.714
murder him.

37
00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:31.260
And he was slowly going crazy and I was watching my friend go crazy and it took

38
00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:34.890
several years for it to be completely resolved and he's still paying her,

39
00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.790
he's still,

40
00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:40.200
he's been divorced for I think 12 years now and he still pays her.

41
00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:44.100
She,
they didn't have a child.
Um,
and he has a family now.

42
00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.910
He's married with children now.
He,
and he still pays this person still pay.

43
00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:53.340
Like he fucked her so hard.
She can't work 12 years later.
Yeah,

44
00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:58.370
it's so that's where men's rights activists have a point because if you're in a

45
00:02:58.441 --> 00:03:03.441
state that's particularly a progressive or liberal in regards to alimony and

46
00:03:04.001 --> 00:03:07.450
child support,
the only love,
the only thing that we win on that,

47
00:03:07.451 --> 00:03:08.380
it's like Tom Arnold,

48
00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.040
like we got one on the board for Tom Arnold when he divorced,

49
00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:15.940
but the problem with that is I love Roseanne more than I love Tom Arnold.

50
00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.250
No offense Tom.
But I do,
you know,

51
00:03:18.251 --> 00:03:20.950
so like it bothered me that Roseanne had to pay him like,
Bro,

52
00:03:20.951 --> 00:03:24.580
get the fuck Outta here.
You can work like why?

53
00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:26.830
How come when you with a successful person,

54
00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:30.460
if that's successful person says fucking kick bricks.
Get out of here.

55
00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:35.590
You have to pay them that that person has to pay the person they're getting rid

56
00:03:35.591 --> 00:03:39.580
of.
Yeah.
What?
Oh,
he's used to her lifestyle.
What's that?

57
00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:43.180
That that I'm used to.
It is a crazy thing.
Yeah.

58
00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:47.560
It's the only thing that makes sense is childcare.
That makes sense.
Like,
Hey,

59
00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:51.970
I'm,
this person is taking care of the children.
They're your children.

60
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.700
You guys had these children together.
You have to contribute to the,
the,
the,

61
00:03:56.701 --> 00:03:59.710
the money that it costs to raise a child.
100% I get it.

62
00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:03.370
What would I don't get his alimony.
I just don't get it.

63
00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:05.080
We're not together anymore.
No.

64
00:04:05.081 --> 00:04:07.720
How we were before we were together and you didn't have any money and then you

65
00:04:07.721 --> 00:04:10.900
met me and now I have money and then you,
you got used to having money.
What?

66
00:04:10.901 --> 00:04:13.480
You're going to have to get used to not having money because now you don't have

67
00:04:13.481 --> 00:04:16.960
any money because now we're not together anymore.
Or like a year maybe.

68
00:04:16.961 --> 00:04:19.930
You know what I mean?
Like,
Hey,
let her take some time to get back on her feet.

69
00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:23.420
Right.
But a prostitute or anything.
Yeah.
You don't have to be,

70
00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.620
and it's just bitterness.
It's like,
I want to take you for everything that I can.

71
00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:29.860
One of my friends who's going through divorce,
he was like,

72
00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:35.080
all my friends who've gotten a divorce,
I mean 80% of them,
if they have kids,

73
00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:38.920
the wife accuses the husband of molesting the kids.
Oh,
Jesus.

74
00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:43.570
Just for visitation,
you know,
just to like put negotiation with.
Yeah,

75
00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:46.510
exactly.
Well,
the lawyers are onto that now.
You know,
I mean,

76
00:04:46.511 --> 00:04:50.410
this is actually something that my friend was warned of when the him,

77
00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:53.740
him and his wife were splitting up like,
is your wife malicious?
Will she,

78
00:04:53.741 --> 00:04:57.670
you know,
make some sort of a baseless accusation?
And he's like,
how so?

79
00:04:57.671 --> 00:05:01.750
And then they went into that.
Yeah,
man,
there's evil people out there that,

80
00:05:01.751 --> 00:05:05.380
and there's also this thing that happens when people break up with someone.

81
00:05:05.381 --> 00:05:07.480
If someone who doesn't want to be with you anymore,

82
00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:11.530
someone that you deeply loved and cared about,
you want them to suffer.

83
00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:15.700
It's weird.
It's weird.
I mean,
it's normal.

84
00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:20.170
So I guess it's not that weird,
but the,
the evil,
vicious jealousy.
