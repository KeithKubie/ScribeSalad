is so if they say they're sleep-deprived

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:04.339
is so if they say they're sleep-deprived
 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:06.070
is so if they say they're sleep-deprived
they haven't slept at all in three days

they haven't slept at all in three days
 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.800
they haven't slept at all in three days
if we actually take them into a lab most

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:08.810
if we actually take them into a lab most
 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:10.210
if we actually take them into a lab most
of the time we actually do see that

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:10.220
of the time we actually do see that
 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:11.680
of the time we actually do see that
they're sleeping on and off here and

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:11.690
they're sleeping on and off here and
 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:13.900
they're sleeping on and off here and
there there might be little episodes of

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:13.910
there there might be little episodes of
 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:18.070
there there might be little episodes of
micro sleeps or naps during the day but

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:18.080
micro sleeps or naps during the day but
 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:19.450
micro sleeps or naps during the day but
they actually are getting a little bit

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:19.460
they actually are getting a little bit
 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:20.590
they actually are getting a little bit
of sleep when we've looked at sleep

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:20.600
of sleep when we've looked at sleep
 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.900
of sleep when we've looked at sleep
diaries of patients with insomnia and

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:22.910
diaries of patients with insomnia and
 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:25.060
diaries of patients with insomnia and
they'll say that they don't sleep for

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:25.070
they'll say that they don't sleep for
 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:27.160
they'll say that they don't sleep for
one or two days and the body actually

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.170
one or two days and the body actually
 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.230
one or two days and the body actually
has a natural function after about the

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240
has a natural function after about the
 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.060
has a natural function after about the
third day to start catching up and you

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:31.070
third day to start catching up and you
 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:32.620
third day to start catching up and you
get a little bit more sleep the third

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:32.630
get a little bit more sleep the third
 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:34.870
get a little bit more sleep the third
night and that's usually where to tell

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880
night and that's usually where to tell
 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:35.950
night and that's usually where to tell
my patients when they start worrying

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:35.960
my patients when they start worrying
 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.050
my patients when they start worrying
that they're not sleeping I say say the

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060
that they're not sleeping I say say the
 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:39.490
that they're not sleeping I say say the
mantra to yourself if I don't sleep

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:39.500
mantra to yourself if I don't sleep
 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.290
mantra to yourself if I don't sleep
tonight I'll likely sleep tomorrow and

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:41.300
tonight I'll likely sleep tomorrow and
 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:42.640
tonight I'll likely sleep tomorrow and
if not tomorrow then definitely the

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:42.650
if not tomorrow then definitely the
 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:44.470
if not tomorrow then definitely the
third because our body has the way of

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:44.480
third because our body has the way of
 

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:48.250
third because our body has the way of
naturally catching up

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:48.260
 
 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.050
 
so there's a few different ways that we

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060
so there's a few different ways that we
 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.210
so there's a few different ways that we
treat insomnia the first thing that we

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:52.220
treat insomnia the first thing that we
 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:54.210
treat insomnia the first thing that we
always do is we look at the cause so

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:54.220
always do is we look at the cause so
 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:56.800
always do is we look at the cause so
more times than not but not every time

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810
more times than not but not every time
 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:58.600
more times than not but not every time
it can be linked to a medical problem

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:58.610
it can be linked to a medical problem
 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:04.180
it can be linked to a medical problem
such as menopause cancer chronic pain we

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:04.190
such as menopause cancer chronic pain we
 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:06.280
such as menopause cancer chronic pain we
also it can be linked to anxiety and

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:06.290
also it can be linked to anxiety and
 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:07.630
also it can be linked to anxiety and
depression those are the more common

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640
depression those are the more common
 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.250
depression those are the more common
causes there are some patients who just

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:09.260
causes there are some patients who just
 

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:10.810
causes there are some patients who just
have insomnia and they've had it since

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:10.820
have insomnia and they've had it since
 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:11.980
have insomnia and they've had it since
they were a kid and we don't quite know

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:11.990
they were a kid and we don't quite know
 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:14.410
they were a kid and we don't quite know
why so when we look at the cause we

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420
why so when we look at the cause we
 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:15.970
why so when we look at the cause we
definitely want to treat whatever else

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980
definitely want to treat whatever else
 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.040
definitely want to treat whatever else
is going on but insomnia often because

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050
is going on but insomnia often because
 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.110
is going on but insomnia often because
it becomes its own diagnosis and that

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120
it becomes its own diagnosis and that
 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:21.670
it becomes its own diagnosis and that
requires its own treatment so if someone

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680
requires its own treatment so if someone
 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.200
requires its own treatment so if someone
has chronic pain we want to manage the

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:23.210
has chronic pain we want to manage the
 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:24.910
has chronic pain we want to manage the
pain but we still want to treat the

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920
pain but we still want to treat the
 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.070
pain but we still want to treat the
insomnia separately so what will tend to

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080
insomnia separately so what will tend to
 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:28.690
insomnia separately so what will tend to
do in our sleep lab is we do a thorough

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700
do in our sleep lab is we do a thorough
 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.940
do in our sleep lab is we do a thorough
evaluation and we usually have myself

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950
evaluation and we usually have myself
 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:32.590
evaluation and we usually have myself
