00:00:00.852 --> 00:00:02.330
GUS CLASS: Thank you, guys,
for coming out for our

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:03.020
presentation.

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:04.310
We're going to be talking
about best

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:06.930
practices for Google+.

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:08.950
Now this is Joanna Smith.

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:09.980
And I'm Gus Class.

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:11.790
And we're Developer Programs
Engineers on Google+.

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.390
For the past couple of months
we've been traveling around,

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:18.740
and talking with people who are
looking at doing Google+

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:20.350
Sign-In integrations.

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:23.820
We've learned a lot about what
works really well, and what

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:24.890
does not work so well.

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:27.350
But the most important thing
that we're going to try to

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:31.920
pass through today is what makes
an amazing integration

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.370
differentiated from a
basic integration.

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:35.450
So Joanna?

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:36.490
JOANNA SMITH: Exactly.

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:37.900
So the first thing
we want to do is

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.100
establish what is amazing.

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.090
And the easiest way I can think
to do this is to show

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.080
you a live example from one of
our partners here at I/O.

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:46.600
So Jolicloud is pretty cool.

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.740
They take all of their content,
be it personal or

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:51.280
social, and they aggregate into
a single user interface

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:52.520
for you to see.

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.460
But what makes them amazing, as
far as partners go, is the

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.440
fact that they do something
called dynamic scoping, where

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.980
they are letting users take
control of their sign-in

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:03.030
process from the
very beginning.

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.280
It can be really overwhelming
for some users, if they are

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.190
presented with a consent
dialogue with a lot of scopes,

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:11.600
because it's basically asking
for this permission and this

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.420
permission and this
permission.

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:15.440
And if you don't understand why
all of those permissions

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.700
are being requested, you might
get a little nervous about

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:18.840
granting access to this app.

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.250
And you might decide
not to do it.

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:23.140
Jolicloud decided to
make it better.

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:25.890
So what they do is you first
click on the button.

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.440
And then they bring up all of
the Google services that they

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:29.600
are offering.

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.990
And you're able to indicate
which Google

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:33.490
services you care about.

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:36.386
So for example, if I don't have
a YouTube account, if I

00:01:36.386 --> 00:01:39.110
don't upload content or videos,
I'm going to be really

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:40.930
concerned about why somebody
wants access

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:42.770
to my YouTube activity.

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:44.410
So I am going to tell Jolicloud
that I'm not

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:46.810
interested in YouTube and
just the other things.

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.910
And then, when I click this red
button again, I'm going to

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:52.780
be presented with a Google
consent dialogue that only has

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:54.020
the scopes that I
have expressed

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:55.690
an interest in already.

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:56.890
And this is what we're
talking about.

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:58.843
When really going above and
beyond as far as the

00:01:58.843 --> 00:02:00.660
integration is concerned,
cater your

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:01.880
experience to the user.

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.730
And let the user have control
over what they are doing, so

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:07.550
that you can customize
for them.

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:09.960
So we have a lot of really cool
tips and tricks today for

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.500
how to really make your
apps stand out.

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.210
But first, let's take our
roadmap, so that you

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:16.000
understand why you're here
and why you want to

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.296
stay in your seat.

00:02:18.296 --> 00:02:19.620
GUS CLASS: So we've
broken up our

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.000
presentation into three pieces.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.810
The first is going to be
about Google+ Sign-In.

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.880
And we're going to talk about
how you can use Sign-In to

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.450
take those people who visit your
site, and turn them into

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:30.950
users of your site.

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.680
Next, we're going to talk about
personalization, which

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.290
is taking those people who are
already on your site, getting

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.820
them integrated into your
site, and giving them an

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:42.680
experience that makes them
want to engage more.

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.130
And then, finally, we're going
to talk about how sharing can

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:48.380
turn those users who are already
engaged on your site

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.430
into people who will grow your
site into something bigger.

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:53.650
So Joanna is going to
start about Sign-In.

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:55.500
JOANNA SMITH: So the very first
thing you want to do is

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.360
you want to get your Google+
Sign-In Button perfect,

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.390
because this is how you're going
to really open a gateway

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:01.430
to your users.

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:03.360
You need them to sign in.

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.660
You need to meet them,
to know who they are.

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:10.090
You need to convince them to
click on that button because,

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.540
if you can get anybody who comes
to your app to click

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.830
Sign-In, they stop being
a visitor, and

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:17.410
they turn into a user.

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:19.710
One of the worst things for a
developer is having tons of

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:22.220
visitors, because you don't know
who they are, or how to

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:24.720
really engage them or keep
them on your site.

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.005
But once you have users, you can
customize the content and

00:03:28.005 --> 00:03:30.130
really surface what's
interesting to them.

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:32.630
So the very first step in
getting somebody to click on

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:35.580
your button, it might seem
kind of obvious, but it's

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:38.280
making your button available.

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:41.390
This means having it
in a lot of places.

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:43.930
It's pretty apparent to most
developers to have their

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:46.200
button on the landing page.

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:47.480
Somebody arrives at the app.

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:48.080
They sign in.

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:49.430
And then they get to go.

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:52.720
It is less apparent to put a
Sign-In button next to a piece

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:56.120
of content, let's say, a video
or an article or a single

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:57.430
[? mean ?] even.

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:59.190
But honestly, this is
the entry point for

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:00.650
most of your users.

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:03.330
They're going to follow a link
or some content that has

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:04.400
already been shared.

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:05.580
That's where they're
going to come in.

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:07.270
This is also where
they're engaged.

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:09.180
This is where they're going
to have something to say.

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.890
So having a Sign-In button right
there waiting for them

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:14.190
is a really important tool.

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:16.310
One way you can do this is
having the Sign-In button as

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:18.560
part of your toolbar, or behind
a menu so that it

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:21.620
follows your user throughout
their entire app experience.

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:24.270
Another way is to try our small
Sign-In button, like the

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:27.100
favicon, so it's there waiting
for them when they decide that

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:28.810
they have something to say.

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:31.480
Because if you can get them to
engage in that conversation,

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:34.230
you're really going to improve
your entire app community.

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:35.570
And that's what we're
going for when

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:37.930
we talk about amazing.

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:39.570
So once you've figured out where
you want to put your

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:42.050
button, you need to make sure
you have the right look and

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:42.930
feel of it.

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:45.660
And part of this comes from
the customization process.

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:46.080
Gus?

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:47.433
GUS CLASS: Mm-hm.

00:04:47.433 --> 00:04:50.640
So let's remember that the
Sign-In button is there

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:53.180
because you want to get users
to sign in to your site.

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:54.260
It's pretty evident.

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:58.570
But what Google has done is they
provided a lot of things

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:02.150
that make it easier for you
to get users on your site.

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:06.090
We have localized the button
to 60 different languages.

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:07.730
We give you multiple sizes.

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:10.740
And we also offer the button
in two colors.

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:13.470
A lot of people have asked in
our integrations, why do you

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:17.620
offer the red button and why do
you offer the white button,

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:22.170
when the Google+ button on
the Google site is red?

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:24.130
And so the reason that we offer
the white button is so

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:27.280
that you can have contrast
if your site has a red

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:29.730
background.

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:34.340
So going back to that, we want
that button to be familiar for

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:36.080
users when they reach
your site.

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:39.480
And so, in this way, we
recommend that you maintain

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:42.970
the Google+ branding on the
button, and that you also

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:45.180
ensure that your button has
contrast so that users can

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:46.390
easily see it.

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:49.620
Now when you customize the
button, as you can see Fancy

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:52.180
has done here, you want to make
sure that you maintain

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:56.600
that contrast, that you also
make sure that the button is

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:59.880
familiar for users who reach
your site, and that it matches

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:01.820
really well with what
you're doing.

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:06.450
So this is one of the best
practices that we've seen very

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:08.590
few people do, but that,
when it's done

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:11.020
well, it works amazingly.

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:13.760
So let's take a look at how
you can handle errors.

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:18.550
So you've probably seen this
line of code here before.

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:20.690
This is a very conventional
sign-in callback.

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:24.080
Now the two conditions that are
the most basic conditions

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:27.890
that you'll see are this top
one, which is when you get an

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:29.960
access token from the
sign-in callback.

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:31.850
And this is just your
success condition.

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:34.590
You know that the user has
successfully signed in.

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:37.080
And then the next is this
immediate failed.

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:38.580
So this is what happens
when the user has

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:39.640
not signed in before.

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:42.230
And then the sign-in callback
gets triggered when the user

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:44.670
automatically tries
to get signed in.

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:46.950
So what Joanna is going to show
you now is how you can go

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:50.170
a little bit beyond that, and do
something to differentiate

00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:51.940
your site from other
integrations.

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:52.960
JOANNA SMITH: Exactly.

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:55.740
So as Gus pointed out, the
first two are very normal

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:57.340
prolific use cases.

00:06:57.340 --> 00:06:59.620
But this second error code,
this one that says

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:02.930
access-denied, this is your
chance to be amazing.

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:06.265
So what this means is it means
that somebody came to your app

00:07:06.265 --> 00:07:10.570
or your site, clicked on
Sign-In, and then hit Cancel.

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:12.100
And as a developer, I
imagine you want to

00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:13.440
know why they're canceling.

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:14.840
What is it about your sign-in

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:17.030
experience that is not engaging?

00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:21.030
And this is actually your moment
to ask your users,

00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:22.190
essentially, right?

00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:24.300
So a sign-in callback is a
beautiful thing, because it

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:26.940
triggers immediately after
somebody takes an action after

00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:28.180
clicking that red button.

00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:31.720
It is your moment to respond
to a user action.

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:34.990
And if that error code is
access_denied, that means

00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:36.230
somebody canceled,
which means your

00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:38.200
response could be a prompt.

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:40.770
It could remind a user of all
of the really cool features

00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:43.490
that you have available to
signed-in users only.

00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:46.220
Or perhaps you ask for a lot of
scopes, and this makes your

00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:47.480
users uncomfortable.

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:49.280
You could explain your
scopes here.

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:52.660
You could have a prompt that
says, hey, we noticed you

00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:53.840
didn't finish signing in.

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:56.470
We'd like to remind you that, if
you grant us permission to

00:07:56.470 --> 00:07:58.870
your Google drive files, we'll
be able to do this, this and

00:07:58.870 --> 00:07:59.910
this for you.

00:07:59.910 --> 00:08:00.940
That's really simple.

00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:02.540
And it's really easy
for you to do.

00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:05.150
And then you can take it a step
further by having another

00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:08.410
Sign-In button where you have a
conversation with this user,

00:08:08.410 --> 00:08:10.800
so they can see why they
want to sign in.

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:12.280
And they can click
it right there.

00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:13.350
They don't have to go back.

00:08:13.350 --> 00:08:14.690
They don't have to start over.

00:08:14.690 --> 00:08:16.770
They can just continue signing
in with your process.

00:08:16.770 --> 00:08:19.310
And this is perfect for a
developer, because you want to

00:08:19.310 --> 00:08:21.120
be able to engage your users.

00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:23.350
You need them to sign in so that
you can learn about who

00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:25.960
they are, and so that you
can begin to personalize

00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:27.960
your app for them.

00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:30.870
If you can really customize the
content for a user, you're

00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:33.600
going to be able to turn them
into a contributor.

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:35.770
Everybody knows those users who
kind of show up, see if

00:08:35.770 --> 00:08:37.429
anything's new, and
then leave.

00:08:37.429 --> 00:08:39.530
But if there aren't any
notifications maybe waiting

00:08:39.530 --> 00:08:41.870
for them, if none of their
social contacts have done

00:08:41.870 --> 00:08:44.120
anything within your app, you
want to show them some other

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:47.765
content that's really
engaging.

00:08:47.765 --> 00:08:51.170
Can you hear me?

00:08:51.170 --> 00:08:51.860
Can you hear me now?

00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:52.210
GUS CLASS: Yes.

00:08:52.210 --> 00:08:52.910
JOANNA SMITH: OK.

00:08:52.910 --> 00:08:55.040
So you want to show them some
content that they're

00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:56.770
interested in so that they
want to continue to

00:08:56.770 --> 00:08:58.860
stay on your app.

00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:00.650
And what you want to do is you
want to turn them into a

00:09:00.650 --> 00:09:01.510
contributor.

00:09:01.510 --> 00:09:04.120
You want them to start joining
the conversation, leaving

00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:06.860
behind a comment, maybe adding
their own content to the

00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:08.540
entire community.

00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:10.530
That's what you really
want from a user.

00:09:10.530 --> 00:09:12.390
That's how you're going to be
able to drive engagement and

00:09:12.390 --> 00:09:15.790
increase the minutes spent
in your app every day.

00:09:15.790 --> 00:09:19.490
So the first step of this is
greeting the user, making them

00:09:19.490 --> 00:09:23.450
identify as a piece, as a
component of your app

00:09:23.450 --> 00:09:24.370
experience.

00:09:24.370 --> 00:09:26.710
And you can do this in
that same callback.

00:09:26.710 --> 00:09:29.610
In the sign-in callback, on the
success condition, if you

00:09:29.610 --> 00:09:32.830
make a people.get API call,
you're going to get their name

00:09:32.830 --> 00:09:33.960
and their profile image.

00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:36.470
And this is the first step
to greeting them.

00:09:36.470 --> 00:09:38.580
You know that you're accustomed
to seeing a profile

00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:39.600
image in the top toolbar.

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:42.540
And the reason is because this
is a powerful statement that

00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:44.830
says, hey, you are
a part of my app.

00:09:44.830 --> 00:09:46.460
Remember that you're
signed in.

00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:50.500
Remember that what you do here
it contributes to your profile

00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:51.720
and your experience.

00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:53.730
But you can also take
it a step further.

00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:56.390
SkillPages is a site where
people can go to list their

00:09:56.390 --> 00:09:59.150
job skills and make contacts
so they can find a new

00:09:59.150 --> 00:10:01.940
position, which means that the
most important thing on a

00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:04.405
SkillPages user is
their profile.

00:10:04.405 --> 00:10:07.530
So they want to keep working
on it, making it perfect.

00:10:07.530 --> 00:10:10.180
And what they can do here
is Gus signs in,

00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:11.770
and it's, hey, Gus.

00:10:11.770 --> 00:10:12.440
We missed you.

00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:14.270
Here are some things for you.

00:10:14.270 --> 00:10:16.400
They greet Gus in a
large greeting.

00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:18.740
They remind him of pieces of
his profile, like what he's

00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:21.567
already connected his profile
to, and also where his

00:10:21.567 --> 00:10:22.480
location is.

00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:24.540
And then they show him
interesting content that they

00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:26.220
think is already relevant
to him.

00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:29.200
So he already has things to
click on, places to go.

00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:32.060
And he is encouraged to remain
in the app for longer than he

00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:34.060
would have if he'd just
logged in, saw no new

00:10:34.060 --> 00:10:35.690
messages and left.

00:10:35.690 --> 00:10:38.190
And this is what we're talking
about with reflecting the user

00:10:38.190 --> 00:10:40.480
back, really making them
feel like they are a

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:41.990
component of your app.

00:10:41.990 --> 00:10:45.320
But people.get is more than
a name and an image.

00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:46.620
Gus, do you want to talk
about the rest?

00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:48.130
GUS CLASS: Absolutely.

00:10:48.130 --> 00:10:50.890
So what SkillPages did in their
integration is they

00:10:50.890 --> 00:10:53.090
didn't stop at just
the profile.

00:10:53.090 --> 00:10:56.270
They went and they realized
that this user has already

00:10:56.270 --> 00:10:59.060
provided Google with lots of
this information that's

00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:00.760
relevant to our site.

00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:04.600
And so what they do is they pull
in your work history, and

00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:07.400
they pull in your educational
history, to give you those

00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:09.970
first couple of steps of
creating your profile.

00:11:09.970 --> 00:11:14.560
Now imagine what an impact this
has on this website that

00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:17.180
needs you to fill out all
this information.

00:11:17.180 --> 00:11:20.470
All of a sudden, you no longer
have to say, oh, I remember

00:11:20.470 --> 00:11:24.590
that I worked at Spam Arrest,
or I remember this and that

00:11:24.590 --> 00:11:26.880
from my work history.

00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:29.560
And the users also don't even
have to fill that out to start

00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:33.130
making the connections that
are relevant for this.

00:11:33.130 --> 00:11:35.520
And you would think that this
is a whole bunch of work.

00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:38.370
But if we actually look at an
example of how this code

00:11:38.370 --> 00:11:42.800
works, it's that same callback
that you've seen before.

00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:46.650
So it's that plus.people.get.

00:11:46.650 --> 00:11:49.040
And in this example here, what
I've done is I filtered it

00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:52.350
down to just the organizations
that that user is part of.

00:11:52.350 --> 00:11:55.390
And once you have those
organizations, you can

00:11:55.390 --> 00:11:58.240
enumerate them by whether or
not they're educational

00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:01.410
history, or whether or not
they're work history.

00:12:01.410 --> 00:12:03.080
But it doesn't stop there.

00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:05.750
If you want to have a really
amazing integration, you can

00:12:05.750 --> 00:12:09.110
go beyond that, because there's
information that users

00:12:09.110 --> 00:12:11.850
are providing you about
themselves already.

00:12:11.850 --> 00:12:15.510
If you want to be really clever,
you can notice inside

00:12:15.510 --> 00:12:19.220
of my stream that I'm sharing
all this information, and

00:12:19.220 --> 00:12:21.150
other people are sharing all
this information, and that

00:12:21.150 --> 00:12:23.230
there's a conversation
going on.

00:12:23.230 --> 00:12:28.300
And so if you're doing
a really intelligent

00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:31.390
integration, if your software
has all sorts of powerful

00:12:31.390 --> 00:12:33.950
features for interpreting this
kind of information and

00:12:33.950 --> 00:12:37.000
building those connections, then
what you can do is you

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:42.570
can then go deeper into that
user's friends' streams.

00:12:42.570 --> 00:12:44.740
Then you can create connections
with their users

00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:46.750
by using that information.

00:12:46.750 --> 00:12:48.710
Now here's how it's done.

00:12:48.710 --> 00:12:51.840
If you look at the code up here,
there is, again, that

00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:54.760
plus.people list where I'm
retrieving the people who that

00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:57.490
user has made visible
to this application.

00:12:57.490 --> 00:13:01.250
And then what I'm doing is
retrieving the activities that

00:13:01.250 --> 00:13:04.150
are publicly shared by those
person's friends.

00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:06.490
And so, in this way, you
can bring in additional

00:13:06.490 --> 00:13:07.900
information, and make
those great

00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:10.580
connections between people.

00:13:10.580 --> 00:13:14.740
Now just getting this
information and personalizing

00:13:14.740 --> 00:13:16.480
your site is the start.

00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:18.090
The next thing that really
is important

00:13:18.090 --> 00:13:20.595
is going to be sharing.

00:13:20.595 --> 00:13:21.620
JOANNA SMITH: That's right.

00:13:21.620 --> 00:13:24.110
Once you know who a user is
interested in, you can start

00:13:24.110 --> 00:13:27.120
using those connections to
really grow your audience.

00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:29.200
And what you want to do here is
you want to turn that user

00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:31.530
who has become a contributor,
that user who is leaving

00:13:31.530 --> 00:13:34.030
content and is an active member
of your community, you

00:13:34.030 --> 00:13:35.530
want them to be an evangelist.

00:13:35.530 --> 00:13:37.570
But you don't want to hire
them or train them.

00:13:37.570 --> 00:13:40.170
All you have to do is convince
them to share.

00:13:40.170 --> 00:13:42.830
Because if a user is talking
about what they're doing on

00:13:42.830 --> 00:13:45.200
your app, they're talking
about your app.

00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:47.380
And that's the best way
for you to grow.

00:13:47.380 --> 00:13:49.540
Word of mouth has always been
the most powerful way to

00:13:49.540 --> 00:13:53.530
really reach out to a new
audience, because if somebody

00:13:53.530 --> 00:13:55.640
brings their connections into
the app, they're going to

00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:56.840
remain in the app.

00:13:56.840 --> 00:13:58.230
That's going to drive
engagement, because they're

00:13:58.230 --> 00:14:01.150
already going to have contacts
and people to interact with.

00:14:01.150 --> 00:14:04.590
And that's why social
is so powerful.

00:14:04.590 --> 00:14:06.900
So if you want to really reach
these new people, the first

00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:09.570
step is understanding why
Google+ is different, because

00:14:09.570 --> 00:14:11.520
we have two different
types of sharing

00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:13.650
available to you as a developer.

00:14:13.650 --> 00:14:15.730
The first is our most active
from of sharing.

00:14:15.730 --> 00:14:16.820
And that's an interactive
post.

00:14:16.820 --> 00:14:19.250
And you've been hearing about
these and how great they are,

00:14:19.250 --> 00:14:21.920
because you get to really
target people.

00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:24.510
You can flash those
notifications across all of

00:14:24.510 --> 00:14:27.210
Google with a message
behind it that means

00:14:27.210 --> 00:14:28.420
something to a user.

00:14:28.420 --> 00:14:29.910
Because users know
that these aren't

00:14:29.910 --> 00:14:30.810
programmatically written.

00:14:30.810 --> 00:14:33.050
They know that it came from a
friend who had control over

00:14:33.050 --> 00:14:35.570
the verbiage and the people
that it shared with.

00:14:35.570 --> 00:14:37.080
So when they see these
posts, they know

00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:37.910
that they mean something.

00:14:37.910 --> 00:14:39.950
And they know that that button
is interesting, that it's

00:14:39.950 --> 00:14:43.390
going to go somewhere beyond
just an app landing page.

00:14:43.390 --> 00:14:46.490
But the second form of sharing
is through app activities.

00:14:46.490 --> 00:14:48.900
And these are programmatically
written to a profile, which

00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:51.320
does make them a more passive
form of sharing.

00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:54.370
But the reason app activities
are amazing is because you're

00:14:54.370 --> 00:14:56.980
not writing to Google+ and
then calling it a day.

00:14:56.980 --> 00:14:59.480
You are writing to Google.

00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:01.800
And this has strong
implications, because Google

00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:02.400
loves data.

00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:04.740
And we like to surface that data
in really interesting and

00:15:04.740 --> 00:15:05.960
meaningful ways.

00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:08.150
So some of you probably noticed
a few weeks ago, at

00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:11.100
TechCrunch Disrupt, we announced
a new feature where

00:15:11.100 --> 00:15:14.150
we are surfacing app activities
in search.

00:15:14.150 --> 00:15:16.120
And this is what you're going
for as a developer.

00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:17.990
You want to be able to reach
the people that your user

00:15:17.990 --> 00:15:19.010
knows and cares about.

00:15:19.010 --> 00:15:21.180
And you also want to be able
to reach people that they

00:15:21.180 --> 00:15:22.960
might not already have
a connection to.

00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:25.920
You want to use your aggregate
data to really appeal to other

00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:30.120
people, to show why your
app is above the rest.

00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:32.270
And so you can take a moment, as
a developer, to think about

00:15:32.270 --> 00:15:34.680
how to best take advantage for
your app of these different

00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:35.690
types of sharing.

00:15:35.690 --> 00:15:38.370
How to really use them to
achieve what you're trying to

00:15:38.370 --> 00:15:41.530
achieve, to grow the metrics
that you care about.

00:15:41.530 --> 00:15:43.770
And once you've figured out
how you want to share, you

00:15:43.770 --> 00:15:45.620
want to make sure that there's
consistency, so that your

00:15:45.620 --> 00:15:48.530
messaging is recognizable and
familiar to the people that

00:15:48.530 --> 00:15:49.660
you're reaching out to.

00:15:49.660 --> 00:15:51.588
And that starts with
schema markup.

00:15:51.588 --> 00:15:52.584
Gus?

00:15:52.584 --> 00:15:53.580
GUS CLASS: Yep.

00:15:53.580 --> 00:15:56.490
So we've been talking about
schema with Google+

00:15:56.490 --> 00:15:58.380
for a very long time.

00:15:58.380 --> 00:16:02.290
This is because schema is very
useful for search engines.

00:16:02.290 --> 00:16:05.950
Many of you guys might already
be putting in schema microdata

00:16:05.950 --> 00:16:09.340
onto your sites for search
engine optimization.

00:16:09.340 --> 00:16:12.880
And so, when you provide this
information, it makes it much

00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:15.420
easier to parse that
data on your site.

00:16:15.420 --> 00:16:20.310
Now, with sharing, we have a new
usage of that microdata.

00:16:20.310 --> 00:16:25.470
What we do is we look when you
pass a URL for that page with

00:16:25.470 --> 00:16:26.980
that microdata on it.

00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:30.770
And we use that microdata
to populate the share

00:16:30.770 --> 00:16:31.660
information.

00:16:31.660 --> 00:16:34.520
So here's a story of two
different shares.

00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:36.250
If you look at the one
on the left, this is

00:16:36.250 --> 00:16:37.790
the interactive post.

00:16:37.790 --> 00:16:40.420
This is a targeted share, one
that's meant to go to a

00:16:40.420 --> 00:16:43.580
specific person or a specific
list of people.

00:16:43.580 --> 00:16:46.260
And you'll notice, in this
interactive post, what I've

00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:49.830
done is I've said, oh, please
come and vote for my picture,

00:16:49.830 --> 00:16:51.930
or come and vote for
[? Aude's ?] picture.

00:16:51.930 --> 00:16:56.000
And inside of this interactive
post, there's a picture,

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.620
there's a title, and then
there's a description.

00:16:58.620 --> 00:17:03.130
And all of this is populated
from the actual page that the

00:17:03.130 --> 00:17:04.630
target is on.

00:17:04.630 --> 00:17:06.710
And so, when you do it like
this, you can also do

00:17:06.710 --> 00:17:08.740
something very interesting.

00:17:08.740 --> 00:17:11.329
You can also have
app activities.

00:17:11.329 --> 00:17:15.369
So what happened is, when I
voted on that picture for

00:17:15.369 --> 00:17:16.046
[? Aude's ?]

00:17:16.046 --> 00:17:20.109
photo, this app activity was
written to my profile.

00:17:20.109 --> 00:17:23.432
And you'll notice that the
information is consistent

00:17:23.432 --> 00:17:24.329
across all of this.

00:17:24.329 --> 00:17:29.380
So the title, the image
and the action--

00:17:29.380 --> 00:17:31.950
well, not the action-- but the
title and the image and the

00:17:31.950 --> 00:17:34.380
description are all consistent
across here.

00:17:34.380 --> 00:17:39.200
And something else happens
when you use URLs.

00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:42.060
When you click on the actual
relevant part there, then you

00:17:42.060 --> 00:17:44.290
can be directed back
to the site.

00:17:44.290 --> 00:17:47.120
And this is a way that users
can re-engage from your

00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:52.120
content in a way that is
familiar with them, and a way

00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:54.910
that the behavior is
what they expect.

00:17:54.910 --> 00:17:57.840
So when you're writing app
activities, when you're

00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:01.080
performing interactive shares,
make sure that you're using

00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:04.640
schema on your target pages
to populate that data.

00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:07.670
Now there's one more thing
I want to bring up here.

00:18:07.670 --> 00:18:10.140
You'll notice these app
activities here.

00:18:10.140 --> 00:18:11.770
They're listed with
different types.

00:18:11.770 --> 00:18:16.290
So there's listened, there's
reviewed, and there's a number

00:18:16.290 --> 00:18:18.450
of other ones that we've
provided now.

00:18:18.450 --> 00:18:22.640
Now this is a great time to
start talking about choosing

00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:25.230
the right app activities, and
choosing the right calls to

00:18:25.230 --> 00:18:27.080
action for your shares.

00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:28.611
Joanna?

00:18:28.611 --> 00:18:30.990
JOANNA SMITH: Some of the most
important things about sharing

00:18:30.990 --> 00:18:35.380
is making sure that your
sharing is meaningful.

00:18:35.380 --> 00:18:36.970
If you're going to grow your
audience, you want to make

00:18:36.970 --> 00:18:38.690
sure that the people that you're
reaching out to are

00:18:38.690 --> 00:18:40.380
responsive to your verbiage,
and to the

00:18:40.380 --> 00:18:42.150
words that you choose.

00:18:42.150 --> 00:18:45.710
And this comes with some
difficulty, because we have so

00:18:45.710 --> 00:18:47.150
many options for you.

00:18:47.150 --> 00:18:49.815
For example, our call to action
label has over 100

00:18:49.815 --> 00:18:52.340
verbs for you to choose
from for that button.

00:18:52.340 --> 00:18:53.920
And some of them are
very similar.

00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:56.120
Consider buy and purchase.

00:18:56.120 --> 00:18:57.830
To most people, these
are synonyms.

00:18:57.830 --> 00:19:00.180
And yet, we've noticed that
some people respond to

00:19:00.180 --> 00:19:02.770
purchasing as if they bought
for somebody else.

00:19:02.770 --> 00:19:05.190
You purchase a gift, but
you buy for yourself.

00:19:05.190 --> 00:19:06.770
And that's a small nuance
that's true for some

00:19:06.770 --> 00:19:07.880
demographics.

00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:09.770
And so this is a moment when,
as a developer, you want to

00:19:09.770 --> 00:19:13.355
find the words that really
appeal to your user base, so

00:19:13.355 --> 00:19:16.140
that when that button appears,
the people that are going to

00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:19.370
want to be involved in your app
are going to click on it.

00:19:19.370 --> 00:19:21.970
And this is also true for app
activity types for that first

00:19:21.970 --> 00:19:25.390
word you see in an app activity,
because most people

00:19:25.390 --> 00:19:28.300
like to use the ad activity,
which is sort of a catch-all.

00:19:28.300 --> 00:19:31.330
It's user added this
content to my app.

00:19:31.330 --> 00:19:33.780
And that's true for so many
instances, which makes it very

00:19:33.780 --> 00:19:35.160
valuable to use.

00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:38.080
But the more specific you can
be for Google, the more that

00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:40.200
we can do with your data, and
the better we'll know how to

00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:42.800
surface it to the right people
at the right time.

00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:44.890
And so, when you're trying to be
specific and you're trying

00:19:44.890 --> 00:19:46.880
to choose, again, it's
that nuancing.

00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:49.290
And a really good example we
had with two of our launch

00:19:49.290 --> 00:19:51.750
partners are TuneIn
and Shazam.

00:19:51.750 --> 00:19:53.840
They're both music discovery
services.

00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:57.190
It's a way for you to find music
and understand it and

00:19:57.190 --> 00:19:58.200
learn about it.

00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:01.380
But TuneIn went with a listen
activity, because that's truly

00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:02.780
what its users are doing.

00:20:02.780 --> 00:20:05.760
They are finding a radio station
anywhere in the globe

00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:06.730
and listening to it.

00:20:06.730 --> 00:20:09.530
And it can have social because,
for example, my

00:20:09.530 --> 00:20:11.880
sister and I can listen to the
same radio station we grew up

00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:14.000
with our whole lives, even
though neither one of us lives

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:15.470
in our hometown any more.

00:20:15.470 --> 00:20:17.120
And that's a really good
bonding moment.

00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:19.190
But it's still a listening
activity.

00:20:19.190 --> 00:20:22.690
Whereas, Shazam decided to go
with more of the discovery

00:20:22.690 --> 00:20:25.240
approach, because when you are
ready to use the Shazam app,

00:20:25.240 --> 00:20:27.160
it's because you're out and you
hear a song, and you're

00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:30.710
trying to remember what the
title is or who the artist is.

00:20:30.710 --> 00:20:33.470
And you really want to be able
to learn more about that song

00:20:33.470 --> 00:20:34.160
or that genre.

00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:37.370
And so that's why it's a
discover activity, because

00:20:37.370 --> 00:20:38.670
it's not just listening.

00:20:38.670 --> 00:20:40.100
There's more to it.

00:20:40.100 --> 00:20:43.090
And the different users that
these two apps are trying to

00:20:43.090 --> 00:20:46.620
reach are going to respond to
the different words better.

00:20:46.620 --> 00:20:48.420
And that's why you can really
take some time, as a

00:20:48.420 --> 00:20:51.560
developer, to think about what
metrics you're really

00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:54.170
interested in or what
demographics you're really

00:20:54.170 --> 00:20:57.330
trying to reach out to or grow
to, and find the words that

00:20:57.330 --> 00:20:58.610
are really going to
work for them.

00:20:58.610 --> 00:21:00.430
And one thing that works
so well for this is

00:21:00.430 --> 00:21:01.700
experimenting.

00:21:01.700 --> 00:21:04.190
Our Google+ Platform Insights
give you a lot of data,

00:21:04.190 --> 00:21:06.380
especially regarding
interactive posts.

00:21:06.380 --> 00:21:08.160
So if you want to use different
verbs at different

00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:10.810
times, maybe do some A and B
testing, you're going to be

00:21:10.810 --> 00:21:13.600
able to see how responsive users
are to the different

00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:16.370
words, and especially using
different verbs at different

00:21:16.370 --> 00:21:17.800
points in your app.

00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:19.800
The different activities that
users can do can trigger

00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:21.110
different interactive shares.

00:21:21.110 --> 00:21:24.750
And this is what's so valuable
about sharing, because it is

00:21:24.750 --> 00:21:25.420
so targeting.

00:21:25.420 --> 00:21:27.030
It's so diverse.

00:21:27.030 --> 00:21:28.870
And that's what you
want to work for.

00:21:28.870 --> 00:21:32.610
But all of this doesn't really
mean anything, if you can't

00:21:32.610 --> 00:21:35.100
target the right people, if
you can't reach out to the

00:21:35.100 --> 00:21:37.090
people that you are the
most interested in.

00:21:37.090 --> 00:21:40.748
And that's the next tip
we have for you.

00:21:40.748 --> 00:21:45.050
GUS CLASS: So if you look at
this code here, you can see

00:21:45.050 --> 00:21:48.150
that here is a conventional
interactive post.

00:21:48.150 --> 00:21:49.910
And then I've done something
different.

00:21:49.910 --> 00:21:52.750
But I'll get to that
in just a second.

00:21:52.750 --> 00:21:55.250
Now, when you create an
interactive post, there's this

00:21:55.250 --> 00:21:57.340
experience where you
can create a good

00:21:57.340 --> 00:21:58.850
experience for the user.

00:21:58.850 --> 00:22:00.270
That interactive post renders.

00:22:00.270 --> 00:22:03.530
And then they have a nice,
well-targeted call to action

00:22:03.530 --> 00:22:07.600
so that when that post appears
in their stream, that users

00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:09.020
know what they're going to
expect when they reach the

00:22:09.020 --> 00:22:10.510
other side of that post.

00:22:10.510 --> 00:22:12.900
Now you can do something
better than that.

00:22:12.900 --> 00:22:15.430
What you can do is you can take
recipients and you can

00:22:15.430 --> 00:22:18.210
pre-fill recipients
into that post.

00:22:18.210 --> 00:22:19.660
And when you do this, something

00:22:19.660 --> 00:22:21.730
very important happens.

00:22:21.730 --> 00:22:25.020
Each of those recipients will
receive a notification across

00:22:25.020 --> 00:22:29.310
Google, when they're in their
Gmail, when they're on their

00:22:29.310 --> 00:22:32.080
Google+ account, when they're
in their calendar.

00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:35.430
Those users will have that
notification there waiting for

00:22:35.430 --> 00:22:39.130
them telling them, this person
want you to do something.

00:22:39.130 --> 00:22:41.450
And that something that
they do goes directly

00:22:41.450 --> 00:22:43.820
back onto your site.

00:22:43.820 --> 00:22:45.660
And this allows your
site to grow more.

00:22:45.660 --> 00:22:49.400
And you get that viral growth
pattern that happens when

00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:52.100
people share to specific
people.

00:22:52.100 --> 00:22:54.750
And because it's coming from a
specific person to another

00:22:54.750 --> 00:22:58.810
specific person, you receive
that social proof that Gus

00:22:58.810 --> 00:23:02.230
wants Joanna to share, or Gus
wants Joanna to do this.

00:23:02.230 --> 00:23:04.630
And so let's look at this
code right here.

00:23:04.630 --> 00:23:07.140
And I'm going to show you how
you can pre-fill those

00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:10.010
recipients so that those
notifications are sent.

00:23:10.010 --> 00:23:12.650
The first example that we have
here on the left is this long

00:23:12.650 --> 00:23:14.060
string of numbers.

00:23:14.060 --> 00:23:15.000
Now this long string of numbers

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:16.720
represents a Google ID.

00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:20.940
So you can retrieve this Google
ID from an API query

00:23:20.940 --> 00:23:23.630
against Google+ to
a list of people.

00:23:23.630 --> 00:23:27.890
And to get this better
experience, what you can do is

00:23:27.890 --> 00:23:29.740
you can order by best.

00:23:29.740 --> 00:23:32.710
And the way that order by best
works is, when that list of

00:23:32.710 --> 00:23:35.770
people comes back from Google,
Google has performed an

00:23:35.770 --> 00:23:37.370
affinity calculation.

00:23:37.370 --> 00:23:40.430
They determined who the people
who are the closest to this

00:23:40.430 --> 00:23:41.760
current user.

00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:44.840
And what that is it's a signal
to who the best people are to

00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:46.710
target this post to.

00:23:46.710 --> 00:23:51.530
And so, if you're targeting
these posts, use order by best

00:23:51.530 --> 00:23:54.660
in order to determine the right
people to share with.

00:23:54.660 --> 00:23:57.700
And we've also done something
else here where we've put in

00:23:57.700 --> 00:24:01.730
someone by email, in this case
just a throw-away email that

00:24:01.730 --> 00:24:04.840
I've given for this
conference.

00:24:04.840 --> 00:24:07.330
And so you can also target
users by email.

00:24:07.330 --> 00:24:10.040
And those users will also
receive notifications.

00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:13.530
Now this is all great.

00:24:13.530 --> 00:24:15.140
You can create this
well-targeted post.

00:24:15.140 --> 00:24:17.670
And you can use signals from
Google, which Google pulls in

00:24:17.670 --> 00:24:20.750
from what those users are doing
on Google+ and in Gmail

00:24:20.750 --> 00:24:22.070
and so forth.

00:24:22.070 --> 00:24:24.670
But you can do something
even greater.

00:24:24.670 --> 00:24:28.540
You can create this amazing
experience for users by

00:24:28.540 --> 00:24:32.145
performing calculations based
upon your own information that

00:24:32.145 --> 00:24:34.030
you have about your own users.

00:24:34.030 --> 00:24:36.880
And you can do things like
create interactions between

00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:41.690
your users by bringing them to
and from the Google+ stream

00:24:41.690 --> 00:24:44.230
with these targeted
interactive posts.

00:24:44.230 --> 00:24:48.320
And this is really what
differentiates a basic

00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:51.960
integration from one that just
really stands out to us.

00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:57.890
And it's always exciting for
users to see that your site is

00:24:57.890 --> 00:25:01.940
created in such a way that their
interactions are made

00:25:01.940 --> 00:25:03.520
much easier.

00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:06.440
So we're going to give you one
more tip about interactive

00:25:06.440 --> 00:25:07.916
posts, before moving on.

00:25:07.916 --> 00:25:11.240
JOANNA SMITH: So anyone who was
at Jonathan Barry's talk

00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:13.050
yesterday with the introduction
to Google+

00:25:13.050 --> 00:25:15.310
Sign-In probably heard something
cool, which is that

00:25:15.310 --> 00:25:18.085
the interactive post is
a Sign-In button.

00:25:18.085 --> 00:25:19.290
But I want to take a
moment to delve a

00:25:19.290 --> 00:25:22.010
little deeper into this.

00:25:22.010 --> 00:25:23.690
The interactive post is
a Sign-In button.

00:25:23.690 --> 00:25:26.160
That's a really cool feature,
because it means that every

00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:29.490
single share on your app could
potentially result in a

00:25:29.490 --> 00:25:30.770
signed-in user.

00:25:30.770 --> 00:25:33.090
And that's what you're really
going for, if your key metric

00:25:33.090 --> 00:25:35.930
is to get more signed-in users
or to really increase

00:25:35.930 --> 00:25:39.840
engagement, because you want
to know who they are.

00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:41.890
You want to understand
your users.

00:25:41.890 --> 00:25:43.860
But there's one drawback to this
feature, which is that

00:25:43.860 --> 00:25:46.270
the interactive post sign-in
option does not support the

00:25:46.270 --> 00:25:48.870
Overthere install consent
dialogue.

00:25:48.870 --> 00:25:51.810
And if you're main metric is
driving Android app installs,

00:25:51.810 --> 00:25:54.110
if that's what you're really
focused on this month or this

00:25:54.110 --> 00:25:56.760
year, this is not the
feature for you.

00:25:56.760 --> 00:26:00.100
And so one thing that we
recommend is that you hide the

00:26:00.100 --> 00:26:00.780
share option.

00:26:00.780 --> 00:26:04.070
Or perhaps you use our original
normal Share button,

00:26:04.070 --> 00:26:05.385
until a user has signed in.

00:26:05.385 --> 00:26:07.740
And then you can replace that
with the interactive post

00:26:07.740 --> 00:26:08.720
sharing option.

00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:11.020
And this way, you can channel
all of your sign-in traffic

00:26:11.020 --> 00:26:13.210
through the Sign-In button, so
you can trigger that Overthere

00:26:13.210 --> 00:26:17.150
install and really drive your
Android app installs.

00:26:17.150 --> 00:26:19.420
But like I said, this is another
one of those moments

00:26:19.420 --> 00:26:21.410
when you really want to think
about what your key metrics

00:26:21.410 --> 00:26:24.250
are as a developer, so that you
can create the integration

00:26:24.250 --> 00:26:26.240
that's really going to be right
for your company and for

00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:28.390
you, as well as for
your users.

00:26:28.390 --> 00:26:31.660
But no matter what you decide,
if you end up going with the

00:26:31.660 --> 00:26:33.560
interactive post or if you just
have sign-in in multiple

00:26:33.560 --> 00:26:36.490
places, you're going to want
to notice that several of

00:26:36.490 --> 00:26:38.020
these parameters are the same.

00:26:38.020 --> 00:26:41.570
These are the parameters that
determine the permissions that

00:26:41.570 --> 00:26:43.300
your users are going
to grant you.

00:26:43.300 --> 00:26:45.770
And if these ever fall out of
sync between any of your

00:26:45.770 --> 00:26:49.730
sign-in options, you're going
to end up with a broken user

00:26:49.730 --> 00:26:50.210
experience.

00:26:50.210 --> 00:26:52.180
You're going to have users who
have granted different levels

00:26:52.180 --> 00:26:53.800
of permissions, depending
on whatever

00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:54.780
these parameters were.

00:26:54.780 --> 00:26:56.330
And that's not amazing.

00:26:56.330 --> 00:26:58.130
And so one thing that you really
want to do is you want

00:26:58.130 --> 00:27:00.910
to be programmatically filling
all of your sign-in things so

00:27:00.910 --> 00:27:03.890
that when you change something,
if you need to add

00:27:03.890 --> 00:27:07.160
an additional app activity type,
or if you want to expand

00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:09.750
to start using Google Drive,
for example, you want to be

00:27:09.750 --> 00:27:11.840
able to change the scopes
everywhere with a single

00:27:11.840 --> 00:27:14.420
change in one place, so that
you never fall out of sync

00:27:14.420 --> 00:27:16.700
with yourself.

00:27:16.700 --> 00:27:19.210
So that's actually all of the
tips that we had for you today

00:27:19.210 --> 00:27:20.520
in this half hour.

00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:22.150
But we have lots more.

00:27:22.150 --> 00:27:23.580
And if you want to
ask us questions,

00:27:23.580 --> 00:27:24.510
we're happy to help.

00:27:24.510 --> 00:27:27.450
They can be specific
or abstract.

00:27:27.450 --> 00:27:29.400
The other thing that we
recommend is we have a lot of

00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:32.600
really cool talks going on this
year at I/O. So if you

00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:35.120
missed Jonathan Barry's talk
yesterday, but you really want

00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:36.940
to know more about each feature,
I recommend watching

00:27:36.940 --> 00:27:38.850
the video as soon
as it goes up.

00:27:38.850 --> 00:27:40.990
And if you're interested in more
mobile tips and tricks,

00:27:40.990 --> 00:27:43.970
we have an entire session in
the Android track dedicated

00:27:43.970 --> 00:27:46.040
just to Google+ Sign-In
on Android.

00:27:46.040 --> 00:27:49.800
Or you can always check out
Ian Barber's talk on iOS

00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:51.650
integration, because the--

00:27:51.650 --> 00:27:54.060
I meant Silvano's talk
on iOS integration--

00:27:54.060 --> 00:27:55.980
because these are the ways you
can really learn about the

00:27:55.980 --> 00:27:58.830
mobile-specific things.

00:27:58.830 --> 00:27:59.810
And then, of course, we're
going to take your

00:27:59.810 --> 00:28:00.520
questions right now.

00:28:00.520 --> 00:28:01.980
We have two mics you
can line up at.

00:28:01.980 --> 00:28:03.455
But before we take those,
we're just going

00:28:03.455 --> 00:28:05.500
to sum things up.

00:28:05.500 --> 00:28:10.170
GUS CLASS: So in short, what we
really wanted to impart on

00:28:10.170 --> 00:28:14.490
you guys is that, when you
create an amazing integration,

00:28:14.490 --> 00:28:18.520
it's just a little different
from the basics.

00:28:18.520 --> 00:28:21.340
Think about the ways that you
can really differentiate and

00:28:21.340 --> 00:28:23.830
make the most of all of
the tools that we're

00:28:23.830 --> 00:28:25.430
offering with Sign-In.

00:28:25.430 --> 00:28:30.210
And when you do this in a really
good way, you get the

00:28:30.210 --> 00:28:33.530
most out of these features.

00:28:33.530 --> 00:28:35.850
You get more users
on your site.

00:28:35.850 --> 00:28:38.590
You end up getting more engaged
users, because these

00:28:38.590 --> 00:28:40.670
users are interacting with
each other more.

00:28:40.670 --> 00:28:42.630
And they have more filled
out profiles.

00:28:42.630 --> 00:28:44.490
And they're finding more
people, making more

00:28:44.490 --> 00:28:45.680
connections.

00:28:45.680 --> 00:28:48.750
And then they're also drawing
more people to your site.

00:28:48.750 --> 00:28:50.040
They're encouraging growth.

00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:54.810
And they're making your site
into a better experience, into

00:28:54.810 --> 00:28:56.740
something better for everyone.

00:28:56.740 --> 00:29:00.950
And one thing that we're always
trying to do is find

00:29:00.950 --> 00:29:03.860
more things that people are
doing really creative uses of

00:29:03.860 --> 00:29:06.400
the APIs for partnerships
that we create.

00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:08.770
So if you guys are out there and
you've got a site, and you

00:29:08.770 --> 00:29:11.280
guys are thinking you're doing
something fantastic, or

00:29:11.280 --> 00:29:14.300
there's something fantastic that
you want to do, but we

00:29:14.300 --> 00:29:17.710
just aren't offering that little
piece that you need to

00:29:17.710 --> 00:29:21.560
be able to do it, find
us on Google+.

00:29:21.560 --> 00:29:25.850
Or reach out to us on the
Google+ Stream or in our

00:29:25.850 --> 00:29:31.590
communities, and let us know
what you're thinking about.

00:29:31.590 --> 00:29:33.780
We always try to be
very responsive to

00:29:33.780 --> 00:29:35.540
what developers want.

00:29:35.540 --> 00:29:38.350
And we also are always eager
to work with people who are

00:29:38.350 --> 00:29:40.530
doing magnificent things.

00:29:40.530 --> 00:29:42.120
So that's all we have.

00:29:42.120 --> 00:29:44.020
Amaze us, guys.

00:29:44.020 --> 00:29:44.910
We're ready for questions.

00:29:44.910 --> 00:29:46.880
Again, please just come
to the aisle and ask

00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:48.114
them from the mics.

00:29:48.114 --> 00:29:54.730
[APPLAUSE]

00:29:54.730 --> 00:29:57.380
AUDIENCE: In your last point,
you mentioned about being able

00:29:57.380 --> 00:30:00.310
to change scopes.

00:30:00.310 --> 00:30:01.910
Can you explain more on that?

00:30:01.910 --> 00:30:05.570
Do you prefer having those
scopes defined?

00:30:05.570 --> 00:30:08.630
I'm developing the Google+
Sign-In for Android.

00:30:08.630 --> 00:30:11.390
And generally, we basically
define the scopes upfront when

00:30:11.390 --> 00:30:13.410
we instantiate the +client.

00:30:13.410 --> 00:30:14.560
But you mentioned about--

00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:17.350
JOANNA SMITH: So what I meant
is if your app has largely

00:30:17.350 --> 00:30:20.160
been targeted toward one, just
toward + and you're later

00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:22.360
expanding to something else,
it's going to be a really

00:30:22.360 --> 00:30:23.070
massive change.

00:30:23.070 --> 00:30:24.470
So you're going to change
it in the +client.

00:30:24.470 --> 00:30:27.330
But it's going to force
re-granting permissions for a

00:30:27.330 --> 00:30:27.900
lot of your users.

00:30:27.900 --> 00:30:28.880
So it'd be a big change.

00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:30.830
But if you ever did that, you
would want to make sure that

00:30:30.830 --> 00:30:32.000
it would change everywhere,
right?

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:32.660
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:30:32.660 --> 00:30:33.020
OK.

00:30:33.020 --> 00:30:34.660
JOANNA SMITH: It's not
like a daily change.

00:30:34.660 --> 00:30:35.010
No.

00:30:35.010 --> 00:30:35.290
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:30:35.290 --> 00:30:37.740
But you wouldn't suggest
like, let's say you

00:30:37.740 --> 00:30:38.600
already signed in.

00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:42.290
And then, while the user is
interacting with their app--

00:30:42.290 --> 00:30:43.900
oh, by the way, I
need this code.

00:30:43.900 --> 00:30:44.185
JOANNA SMITH: To
sign-in again.

00:30:44.185 --> 00:30:44.790
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:30:44.790 --> 00:30:46.910
JOANNA SMITH: You wouldn't want
an experience where users

00:30:46.910 --> 00:30:49.480
have to sign in and then somehow
re-grant permissions,

00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:51.640
which is why we have that
ability to have multiple

00:30:51.640 --> 00:30:54.120
scopes in a single string.

00:30:54.120 --> 00:30:57.070
It's this separated string, so
that you can get all of the

00:30:57.070 --> 00:30:58.665
permissions in one
consent dialog.

00:30:58.665 --> 00:30:59.260
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:30:59.260 --> 00:31:00.035
JOANNA SMITH: And that's
what's so good.

00:31:00.035 --> 00:31:00.720
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:01.110
Yeah.

00:31:01.110 --> 00:31:01.500
Thank you.

00:31:01.500 --> 00:31:03.290
GUS CLASS: And so yeah, I'll
make one more comment there.

00:31:03.290 --> 00:31:04.120
AUDIENCE: Sure.

00:31:04.120 --> 00:31:07.220
GUS CLASS: What Jolicloud is
doing is that, when the user

00:31:07.220 --> 00:31:09.740
signs in, there's a button
on the bottom.

00:31:09.740 --> 00:31:11.810
Technically speaking, it's
a fake Sign-In button.

00:31:11.810 --> 00:31:11.990
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:31:11.990 --> 00:31:14.630
GUS CLASS: When they click
it, it draws up a pop-up.

00:31:14.630 --> 00:31:17.160
And then they have this
selector, so you just click on

00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:18.610
check boxes.

00:31:18.610 --> 00:31:20.730
And then the scopes field that
is passed into the Sign-In

00:31:20.730 --> 00:31:22.360
button that renders
on the bottom

00:31:22.360 --> 00:31:23.645
is dynamically populated.

00:31:23.645 --> 00:31:24.410
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:31:24.410 --> 00:31:24.930
Right.

00:31:24.930 --> 00:31:27.780
GUS CLASS: I mean, it's a very
small snippet of code that you

00:31:27.780 --> 00:31:29.166
would have to write in
order to do that.

00:31:29.166 --> 00:31:31.040
JOANNA SMITH: It just appends a
string, depending on what's

00:31:31.040 --> 00:31:31.430
been checked.

00:31:31.430 --> 00:31:31.596
GUS CLASS: Yeah.

00:31:31.596 --> 00:31:31.770
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:31:31.770 --> 00:31:35.100
So basically, the user would
basically select

00:31:35.100 --> 00:31:36.875
what he or she wants.

00:31:36.875 --> 00:31:37.900
And then, depending
on what's the

00:31:37.900 --> 00:31:39.160
selection, that's the scope.

00:31:39.160 --> 00:31:39.890
JOANNA SMITH: Yeah.

00:31:39.890 --> 00:31:42.220
So it's honestly just a
dynamically appended string.

00:31:42.220 --> 00:31:42.353
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:31:42.353 --> 00:31:44.170
JOANNA SMITH: And then that gets
passed in the OAuth call.

00:31:44.170 --> 00:31:45.380
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:31:45.380 --> 00:31:46.090
Thank you.

00:31:46.090 --> 00:31:47.986
GUS CLASS: Thank you.

00:31:47.986 --> 00:31:52.480
AUDIENCE: Going back to
people.get, and importing

00:31:52.480 --> 00:31:55.760
people's personal information
that already exists as part of

00:31:55.760 --> 00:31:58.535
the Google profile, how would
you suggest dealing with, I

00:31:58.535 --> 00:32:03.690
guess you would call it the
creepy factor, where people

00:32:03.690 --> 00:32:07.230
see their information on
whatever service they happen

00:32:07.230 --> 00:32:11.070
to sign in, to and don't
understand where it came from

00:32:11.070 --> 00:32:12.995
and how it got there, even if
they have already provided

00:32:12.995 --> 00:32:15.240
that information elsewhere?

00:32:15.240 --> 00:32:17.880
Because I've definitely heard
a lot of complaints, even

00:32:17.880 --> 00:32:19.145
people talking about
Google Services.

00:32:19.145 --> 00:32:19.890
GUS CLASS: Yeah.

00:32:19.890 --> 00:32:22.120
AUDIENCE: And they don't
understand how that

00:32:22.120 --> 00:32:23.550
information got where it got.

00:32:23.550 --> 00:32:26.880
And it bothers them.

00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:30.250
GUS CLASS: So the activities
read API, which is the way

00:32:30.250 --> 00:32:33.210
that you can read people's data,
is restricted only to

00:32:33.210 --> 00:32:33.940
public data.

00:32:33.940 --> 00:32:38.870
And this is to protect the
users, and to maintain that

00:32:38.870 --> 00:32:42.000
expectation that their data is
private and safe within the

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:42.860
social network that we have.

00:32:42.860 --> 00:32:44.580
JOANNA SMITH: But more
specifically, I think it's

00:32:44.580 --> 00:32:46.380
what you're getting at, if
you're using the people.get

00:32:46.380 --> 00:32:48.640
call and you're trying to pull
in their work experience and

00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:54.070
stuff, it's granted in the
response, only if it's been

00:32:54.070 --> 00:32:55.530
made available on the stream.

00:32:55.530 --> 00:32:57.160
So if they've hidden it there,
it won't come to you.

00:32:57.160 --> 00:32:59.070
So there will never
be a surprise.

00:32:59.070 --> 00:33:01.170
But one thing you could do, if
you are worried about that

00:33:01.170 --> 00:33:04.110
creepy factor, because I
understand what you mean, is

00:33:04.110 --> 00:33:05.630
there's two things that
I can see working.

00:33:05.630 --> 00:33:07.320
You could have a favicon.

00:33:07.320 --> 00:33:09.050
Like, oh, you got
this from G+.

00:33:09.050 --> 00:33:11.940
Or you could try the
"confirm" dialogue.

00:33:11.940 --> 00:33:13.120
Hey, we've pulled
your profile.

00:33:13.120 --> 00:33:14.350
We see that you worked
here, here and here.

00:33:14.350 --> 00:33:15.100
Is this true?

00:33:15.100 --> 00:33:16.530
And then let them
edit it, right?

00:33:16.530 --> 00:33:18.130
Because if they feel like
they've had some sort of

00:33:18.130 --> 00:33:21.410
control, they'll probably feel
more ownership over it, as

00:33:21.410 --> 00:33:23.390
opposed to creepiness.

00:33:23.390 --> 00:33:24.940
GUS CLASS: And a final note.

00:33:24.940 --> 00:33:28.310
When you're pulling this data,
there is a developer policy

00:33:28.310 --> 00:33:30.600
that, once that user explicitly
disconnects their

00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:35.340
account, that the data
should be deleted.

00:33:35.340 --> 00:33:37.500
So in doing this, we do
try to build that

00:33:37.500 --> 00:33:38.810
trust for the users.

00:33:38.810 --> 00:33:42.140
And we hope that, over time,
that that will show through

00:33:42.140 --> 00:33:43.790
with our services.

00:33:43.790 --> 00:33:44.330
Thank you.

00:33:44.330 --> 00:33:47.030
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:33:47.030 --> 00:33:48.380
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:33:48.380 --> 00:33:51.376
This question is
about sharing.

00:33:51.376 --> 00:33:52.130
GUS CLASS: Sorry.

00:33:52.130 --> 00:33:52.310
Say that again?

00:33:52.310 --> 00:33:54.150
AUDIENCE: The question
is about sharing.

00:33:54.150 --> 00:33:54.760
GUS CLASS: Oh, sure, yeah.

00:33:54.760 --> 00:33:55.130
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:33:55.130 --> 00:34:00.350
So when a user clicks on Share
button, does the application

00:34:00.350 --> 00:34:03.540
get information about
user, like user ID?

00:34:03.540 --> 00:34:05.440
JOANNA SMITH: When somebody
clicks the Share button?

00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:05.626
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:34:05.626 --> 00:34:08.810
JOANNA SMITH: So that Share
button is a Google owned,

00:34:08.810 --> 00:34:09.860
Google created button.

00:34:09.860 --> 00:34:11.550
So if they aren't signed
in to your app?

00:34:11.550 --> 00:34:13.690
Is that your use case?

00:34:13.690 --> 00:34:15.249
Like they aren't signed in, but
they're trying to share?

00:34:15.249 --> 00:34:15.910
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:34:15.910 --> 00:34:17.770
JOANNA SMITH: So in that
instance, when somebody's not

00:34:17.770 --> 00:34:20.360
signed in to you, but they are
signed in to their browser or

00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:24.090
into their phone, then we're
going to know that, because

00:34:24.090 --> 00:34:26.620
we're Google and we know when
somebody's signed in to the

00:34:26.620 --> 00:34:28.830
browser, for example, like
signed in to Chrome.

00:34:28.830 --> 00:34:30.830
And so, when they go to
share, we'll pull

00:34:30.830 --> 00:34:31.620
that information in.

00:34:31.620 --> 00:34:34.300
Or if they're not signed in at
all or if we don't know, then

00:34:34.300 --> 00:34:36.210
it'll pull in a sign-up
dialogue first.

00:34:36.210 --> 00:34:37.540
And they can sign in,
and then they can

00:34:37.540 --> 00:34:38.550
continue with the share.

00:34:38.550 --> 00:34:41.270
AUDIENCE: So the callback
response gives the user ID,

00:34:41.270 --> 00:34:42.870
something like that, right?

00:34:42.870 --> 00:34:45.015
GUS CLASS: For interactive
lists.

00:34:45.015 --> 00:34:46.980
AUDIENCE: After clicking
on the Share button.

00:34:46.980 --> 00:34:47.970
Let's say you are signed in.

00:34:47.970 --> 00:34:48.770
JOANNA SMITH: Oh.

00:34:48.770 --> 00:34:51.280
So you're trying to say for
callback for a share?

00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:51.506
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:34:51.506 --> 00:34:53.449
JOANNA SMITH: So we
don't currently

00:34:53.449 --> 00:34:55.380
have our own callback.

00:34:55.380 --> 00:34:58.160
And if you're creating one, you
would want to have it so

00:34:58.160 --> 00:35:00.200
that they signed in first, so
that you would already have

00:35:00.200 --> 00:35:01.500
information about them.

00:35:01.500 --> 00:35:02.720
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:06.690
So I want to encourage users to
share with something then.

00:35:06.690 --> 00:35:10.260
So I want to reward them with
points or anything, like in a

00:35:10.260 --> 00:35:10.960
loyalty program.

00:35:10.960 --> 00:35:13.420
So I want a callback
response when they

00:35:13.420 --> 00:35:15.580
click on Share button.

00:35:15.580 --> 00:35:19.160
GUS CLASS: So in those cases,
there is no first party

00:35:19.160 --> 00:35:21.900
offering that we have that
will allow you to detect

00:35:21.900 --> 00:35:23.370
whether or not that
user shares.

00:35:23.370 --> 00:35:24.751
Is that what you're asking?

00:35:24.751 --> 00:35:25.057
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:35:25.057 --> 00:35:25.160
Yeah.

00:35:25.160 --> 00:35:25.850
JOANNA SMITH: Oh.

00:35:25.850 --> 00:35:29.310
So OK, I don't really know quite
what you're getting at.

00:35:29.310 --> 00:35:31.880
But one thing I can say is, if
you want to come to our booth

00:35:31.880 --> 00:35:33.300
right after this, we'll
both be there.

00:35:33.300 --> 00:35:34.520
And we can try to figure
out your question

00:35:34.520 --> 00:35:35.190
a little bit better.

00:35:35.190 --> 00:35:35.823
AUDIENCE: Oh.

00:35:35.823 --> 00:35:36.140
Thank you.

00:35:36.140 --> 00:35:36.930
JOANNA SMITH: [INAUDIBLE].

00:35:36.930 --> 00:35:37.410
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:35:37.410 --> 00:35:38.070
Thank you.

00:35:38.070 --> 00:35:38.556
JOANNA SMITH: Thanks.

00:35:38.556 --> 00:35:41.472
GUS CLASS: Yep.

00:35:41.472 --> 00:35:42.947
JOANNA SMITH: I didn't
know that I did that.

00:35:42.947 --> 00:35:43.820
Does anyone else have
any questions?

00:35:43.820 --> 00:35:46.245
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:46.245 --> 00:35:46.790
JOANNA SMITH: OK.

00:35:46.790 --> 00:35:47.140
Well, thank you.

00:35:47.140 --> 00:35:47.410
GUS CLASS: All right.

00:35:47.410 --> 00:35:48.560
Well, a very big thanks,
you guys.

00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:51.537
[APPLAUSE]
