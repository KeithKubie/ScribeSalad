00:00:01.804 --> 00:00:03.020
CELINE: I'm Celine.

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:07.210
I'm thrilled to be here with
Loree, a pioneer in our midst.

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:09.270
So why don't I just kick it off.

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:12.840
The format will be, I'll have a
couple of questions for Loree,

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.540
and then we'll open it up to any
questions you guys might have.

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:20.060
So think about those, and
we'll open up to you guys

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:23.500
probably 10, 15 minutes
before the end of the event.

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:24.000
OK.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:24.910
So, hi, Loree.

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:26.545
LOREE DRAUDE: Hi, Celine.

00:00:26.545 --> 00:00:27.795
CELINE: So, let's kick it off.

00:00:27.795 --> 00:00:29.940
And can you just give
us a brief background

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:35.180
of what took you to the
Navy and how you ended up

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:36.959
on that groundbreaking
deployment.

00:00:36.959 --> 00:00:37.750
LOREE DRAUDE: Sure.

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:40.580
Well, in some ways, I like
to say that it's genetic.

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:42.960
Both my parents were
in the military.

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.830
My dad was a career
Marine Corps officer,

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:48.580
and my mom was in the
Marines for a year.

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:49.629
She and my dad married.

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:50.670
She got pregnant with me.

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.580
And back then, if you
were a woman officer,

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:54.955
you had to get out of the
military when you got pregnant.

00:00:54.955 --> 00:00:58.920
So I kind of ended my
mom's military career.

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.700
But I think growing
up in the Marine Corp,

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:03.950
there were just certain
values that were imbued in me,

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:06.230
that there was an expectation
that I would somehow

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:07.580
serve my country.

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:10.860
And I was very used to
the military environment.

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.120
I grew up with two brothers.

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:13.710
I'm the oldest of three.

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.490
So I was very used to being
in a military environment

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.380
and being comfortable
around my brothers.

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.300
So when it came
time for college,

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:28.090
I wasn't really sure
what I wanted to do.

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:31.130
At that time, I had no
idea about aviation.

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.080
My dad was an infantry
officer, which

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.540
means he's boots on the ground.

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:38.250
And any time he ever
talked about aviators,

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.460
it was typically what
slackers they are.

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:45.290
So I didn't really have
a favorable impression

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:47.680
of aviation at that
point, and I had no idea

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.340
that women could do it.

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:51.930
So I went off to college
at University of San Diego

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.926
and started Navy ROTC there.

00:01:54.926 --> 00:01:57.550
And while I was there, I went on
a field trip my freshman year.

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:01.400
And San Diego, huge military
base, especially Navy.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.460
So we went to Miramar.
we went to El Toro,

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:06.390
to Tustin, all of
these military bases,

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.130
and it was an
aviation-themed field trip.

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:11.100
And I met a bunch of aviators.

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.720
And what impressed
me was that they

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.550
were so passionate
about what they did,

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:18.180
and they were really funny.

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.230
There's some combination
of humor and passion

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.130
that just really appealed to me.

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:25.496
And I think I had made
some comment about, oh,

00:02:25.496 --> 00:02:26.870
this looks like
such a great job.

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:28.030
I wish I could do it.

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:29.613
And they were like,
oh, well actually,

00:02:29.613 --> 00:02:33.554
there are some female pilots
who are instructor pilots.

00:02:33.554 --> 00:02:35.220
So they go through
the training syllabus

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:36.660
and then they
become instructors,

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.520
or they're combat
support pilots, which

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.930
means you don't actually go
out and fly a combat mission,

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.580
but you train
other combat pilots

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.044
on how to do their mission.

00:02:46.044 --> 00:02:46.835
And I thought, wow.

00:02:46.835 --> 00:02:47.160
Cool.

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:48.325
OK, I can live with that.

00:02:48.325 --> 00:02:50.600
That sounds really interesting.

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.640
So I applied to flight school
and went to flight school

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:58.050
after I got my commission
and graduated from college.

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:01.310
So in flight school,
my expectation

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.520
was that I was going to
become either an instructor

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:05.720
pilot or a combat
support pilot, and that's

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:06.640
indeed what happened.

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:11.010
I became a support
pilot in F-18 Hornets.

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.220
So what I would do is
I would fly in an F-18,

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.190
and I would pretend
to be a missile.

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:19.330
I'd go really fast, and
ships and other aircraft

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:21.510
would practice tracking me.

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:24.190
So in that way I
was training them.

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:27.110
But I got to fly an F-18,
which was really amazing.

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:30.690
It's just an incredible
piece of machinery,

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:34.310
and I felt very lucky
to be able to do that.

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:38.180
But when I had gone
through my training,

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:41.710
before I ever went to F-18s, I
did do carrier qualifications

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:42.640
in the training jet.

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:46.286
And actually, my training was
exactly the same as all the men

00:03:46.286 --> 00:03:47.910
that were going
through up to the point

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:50.140
to when we selected
what we were going

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:53.230
to after finishing
that training.

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:55.430
Then they would
go to combat jets,

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:57.720
and I would go to
a support squadron.

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.870
So I remember thinking
during the training

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:01.460
while we were out
on the carrier and I

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:04.870
had done my first landings
in this training jet, wow.

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:07.294
This is amazing.

00:04:07.294 --> 00:04:08.710
This looks like
an incredible job,

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:11.380
and again, I'm really
bummed I can't do this

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:14.730
because women aren't allowed
to fly in combat jets.

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:16.079
But this is really neat.

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:19.019
So when the law
did change in '93

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:20.769
and that option
became available,

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:24.220
I was very excited to become
part of that and to deploy.

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:27.516
And I ended up doing
two deployments.

00:04:27.516 --> 00:04:30.140
The reason I wrote the book was
because of my first deployment.

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:33.030
It was the first one that
had women on the West Coast,

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:36.740
and we had a lot of challenges.

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:39.740
And when we got back from
that first appointment,

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:42.600
there were some news stories.

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:47.560
Some of the women who in
my air wing-- I'll explain.

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:52.000
An air wing is the larger group
of all the various squadrons

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.200
on an aircraft carrier,
typically about 10 squadrons.

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:59.010
So you have the F-18 squadrons,
you have the Tomcat squadrons,

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:01.650
you have the E-2, the one
with the Frisbee on top

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:04.480
that does early warning.

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:08.310
And in the air wing, we
had had about 20 women,

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:11.050
and a few of them had had
some pretty bad experiences

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:13.892
and went to the
media and claimed

00:05:13.892 --> 00:05:15.600
that they had been
discriminated against.

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:18.580
And so I had had a pretty
positive experience,

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:20.090
and I didn't feel
like that really

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:22.210
represented my experience
in the military.

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:25.440
I certainly had encountered
some challenges as well,

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:28.980
but I guess I wanted to
tell my story about how

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:30.280
the deployment had gone for me.

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:32.670
And so that's why
I wrote the book.

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:33.360
CELINE: Great.

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:37.100
So your deployment started
off with a bit of a tragedy.

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:39.239
Can you share with
us what happened

00:05:39.239 --> 00:05:40.780
and how that might
have set the tone?

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:42.010
LOREE DRAUDE: Sure.

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:45.600
So the very first day I went
out to the "Abraham Lincoln,"

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:48.790
which was the carrier
that I was assigned to.

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:53.080
I flew out with my crew, and
this was the training period

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:55.926
before we go out on a
six-month deployment.

00:05:55.926 --> 00:05:57.800
We call it work-ups
because you're working up

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:00.750
to go out on the real deal,
out to the Persian Gulf.

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:02.780
And so we were off the
coast of California,

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:05.170
and I flew out with my crew.

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:06.795
And it was a gorgeous
San Diego day.

00:06:06.795 --> 00:06:08.920
And we were in the holding
pattern, which typically

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:11.050
is about 20 miles
south of the ship.

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:14.150
And so I'm on a radio
frequency that all

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:16.150
of the planes that
are approaching

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:19.770
are on, which is separate
from the tower frequency.

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:22.210
The tower frequency is the
one that the airplanes who

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:25.380
are at the carrier practice
doing their landings

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:28.600
and takeoffs, so they're
on a separate frequency.

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:30.190
So we were just
hanging out, waiting

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:32.380
to get called to come
approach the carrier

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:33.760
and do our landings.

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:36.410
And it was taking a long time.

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:38.991
And even some of
the guys in my jet

00:06:38.991 --> 00:06:41.240
who had been on deployments
before and training before

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:44.070
were like, I don't
know what's going on.

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:46.090
We just figured, oh, we're new.

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:48.260
They're figuring
out how to do this.

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:49.750
So we ended up going.

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:52.960
I did my landings, and
then, since we were still

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:55.250
doing work-ups, we
flew back to San Diego,

00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:58.580
and later found out
that the reason that we

00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:01.620
were on holding for so long was
because a Tomcat had crashed

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:04.180
right when we had arrived
in the holding pattern.

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:07.120
And we had no idea
until we got back.

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:13.620
I read in the newspaper the next
morning that what had happened

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:16.420
was the Tomcat had
been coming in to land,

00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:18.310
had an engine failure.

00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:19.970
The jet crashed.

00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:25.500
The pilot in the front
seat had ejected.

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:27.470
They had been lost
at sea, and they

00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:31.550
had withheld the name pending
notifying his next of kin.

00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:34.310
The RIO had been ejected
and was out safely.

00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:37.070
And so I was slightly relieved
because I didn't really

00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:38.950
know any the male
pilots at the squadron.

00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:40.440
But I knew all the women.

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:43.780
There were three women in that
squadron, two pilots and one

00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:46.760
RIO, which stands for
Radar Intercept Officer.

00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:47.260
Sorry.

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:49.551
There's so many acronyms in
the Navy, just like Google.

00:07:52.310 --> 00:07:56.970
So it turned out that that
pilot was Kara Hultgreen,

00:07:56.970 --> 00:08:03.270
and she had died during
this landing approach.

00:08:03.270 --> 00:08:05.540
And so I didn't find out
until I had come back

00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:07.570
to the ship the next day.

00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:11.460
And it was, obviously,
devastating to lose a friend.

00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:15.560
But also, this is the very
beginning of our work-ups.

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:18.280
The women had just really
started showing up on the ship.

00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:21.730
And there were already
some grumblings among some

00:08:21.730 --> 00:08:23.940
of the men on the
ship, especially

00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:27.300
in some of the fighter
squadrons, which

00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:35.559
tend to be very macho, not so
accepting of, I think, change.

00:08:35.559 --> 00:08:43.440
So that really set a really
tough tone for our deployment.

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:46.460
There were questions
about her qualifications

00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:47.490
almost immediately.

00:08:47.490 --> 00:08:50.550
And in all the years
that I had served,

00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:52.530
I had never ever seen
people question--

00:08:52.530 --> 00:08:55.720
when a male aviator had a crash,
they would never question,

00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:58.180
or people wouldn't release
his training records

00:08:58.180 --> 00:09:00.840
to the public, which
happened with Kara.

00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:05.764
So that just added to
the stress, for sure.

00:09:05.764 --> 00:09:08.180
CELINE: You said you had a
relatively positive experience,

00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:10.450
but have you ever
felt discriminated

00:09:10.450 --> 00:09:12.469
against for being a
woman in the Navy?

00:09:12.469 --> 00:09:13.260
LOREE DRAUDE: Yeah.

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:15.260
I mean, there are definitely
a lot of situations

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:16.270
that I found myself in.

00:09:16.270 --> 00:09:18.630
And really, depending
on the situation,

00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:21.280
I think that determined
my course of action.

00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:23.890
So there's certain battles
that are worth fighting,

00:09:23.890 --> 00:09:28.520
and there are certain
battles that you just let go.

00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:31.760
So I think there's a difference
between discrimination

00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:34.730
and hostile
environment, and there

00:09:34.730 --> 00:09:37.100
are a lot of hostile
environments in the Navy.

00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:39.960
Just places where--

00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:44.200
CELINE: Tell us about an example
of a hostile environment.

00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:48.790
LOREE DRAUDE: So one time
we did a training detachment

00:09:48.790 --> 00:09:50.225
to El Centro,
California, which is

00:09:50.225 --> 00:09:51.600
kind of in the
middle of nowhere,

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:55.060
and training squadrons come
through there regularly.

00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:58.350
And so the squadron
before us had left up

00:09:58.350 --> 00:09:59.925
a poster in the ready room.

00:09:59.925 --> 00:10:02.050
And the ready room is where
all the pilots hang out

00:10:02.050 --> 00:10:03.710
waiting to go do their flights.

00:10:03.710 --> 00:10:10.000
And it was this poster of
three very well-endowed women

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.030
with very little on, and
it said something like,

00:10:12.030 --> 00:10:16.802
to the studs of VT-22,
whatever the squadron is,

00:10:16.802 --> 00:10:18.510
we love you guys, or
something like that.

00:10:18.510 --> 00:10:19.910
And so we walked in,
and everyone kind of

00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:20.826
laughed at the poster.

00:10:20.826 --> 00:10:22.620
And I was like, OK.

00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:25.257
And then I expected the next
day that it would be taken down.

00:10:25.257 --> 00:10:26.340
Well, no one took it down.

00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:27.350
And so I'm like, OK.

00:10:27.350 --> 00:10:29.058
I'm going to have a
little fun with this.

00:10:29.058 --> 00:10:33.530
So I went and bought a Playgirl
and got the centerfold.

00:10:33.530 --> 00:10:39.120
And I think I made a drawing
of the bombs that we carry,

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:43.510
and I just cut that out and put
it on the-- covered up the guy

00:10:43.510 --> 00:10:46.920
and put that up on the wall,
and wrote something like,

00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:49.150
to the hot babe--
because I was the only

00:10:49.150 --> 00:10:54.750
female student-- of VT-23.

00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:58.620
Hope you can get your bomb on
target, or something like that.

00:10:58.620 --> 00:10:59.900
It was funny.

00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:01.590
We joked about
that kind of stuff.

00:11:01.590 --> 00:11:04.659
I felt like when I was going
through the training command,

00:11:04.659 --> 00:11:06.700
it was like going through
with a lot of brothers.

00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:10.230
I mean, at that
time, I was not going

00:11:10.230 --> 00:11:11.560
to be assigned to a combat jet.

00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:12.930
So I don't know.

00:11:12.930 --> 00:11:16.040
I was maybe this
curiosity going through.

00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:19.350
The other thing, too, is
that my executive officer

00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:23.270
in my training squad was African
American and a Tomcat pilot,

00:11:23.270 --> 00:11:25.320
and that's extremely rare.

00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:27.460
There just were not a
lot of minority pilots.

00:11:27.460 --> 00:11:30.090
And so I think he really
looked out for me a lot.

00:11:30.090 --> 00:11:34.390
And having a mentor like that
and an advocate really helped.

00:11:34.390 --> 00:11:36.540
Anyway, the funny thing
was that some of the guys

00:11:36.540 --> 00:11:37.930
were like, that's so gross.

00:11:37.930 --> 00:11:41.000
And I'm like, yeah.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:42.770
Have a little appreciation here.

00:11:42.770 --> 00:11:47.800
And we took both posters
down and laughed about it.

00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:50.420
That wasn't so bad, and
we joked about that.

00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:53.880
I had a really tough time
going through the F-18 Hornet

00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:55.039
training squadron.

00:11:55.039 --> 00:11:56.580
And I think a lot
of that was timing.

00:11:56.580 --> 00:11:58.465
It was right after Tailhook '91.

00:11:58.465 --> 00:12:00.340
And if you know anything
about Tailhook '91--

00:12:00.340 --> 00:12:01.170
CELINE: Tell us about that.

00:12:01.170 --> 00:12:01.878
LOREE DRAUDE: OK.

00:12:01.878 --> 00:12:03.480
It was a big controversy
for the Navy.

00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:06.710
They have an annual convention
every year in Las Vegas--

00:12:06.710 --> 00:12:10.720
they used to until Tailhook '91.

00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:13.180
And it's like a big reunion.

00:12:13.180 --> 00:12:16.729
And Naval aviators, Marine
Corps aviators from all

00:12:16.729 --> 00:12:18.520
over get together, and
it's your one chance

00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:20.910
to catch back up with
all your friends.

00:12:20.910 --> 00:12:23.290
Defense contractors come
in and give you swag.

00:12:23.290 --> 00:12:26.040
I mean, it's just a big party.

00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:28.730
And so the year I went,
I was still a student.

00:12:28.730 --> 00:12:34.240
Before I went, my squadron mates
had told me, don't go here.

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:35.000
Don't go here.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:36.230
These are bad areas.

00:12:36.230 --> 00:12:36.980
Bad things happen.

00:12:36.980 --> 00:12:38.120
Just stay away from them.

00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:42.250
And the "theres" were the third
floor of the Las Vegas Hilton.

00:12:42.250 --> 00:12:45.090
And it tended to be this
really crowded party

00:12:45.090 --> 00:12:47.520
environment with a lot
alcohol, and people

00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:49.840
would do pretty
inappropriate things.

00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:51.990
And so the year that
I went, the only year

00:12:51.990 --> 00:12:56.230
that I went to Tailhook,
there was a female officer

00:12:56.230 --> 00:12:57.010
who was assaulted.

00:12:57.010 --> 00:12:59.570
There were several women
who had gotten assaulted.

00:12:59.570 --> 00:13:02.190
And so there was this big
investigation that happened.

00:13:02.190 --> 00:13:05.630
This was also right at the
end of the first Gulf War.

00:13:05.630 --> 00:13:09.770
So a lot of aviators were
coming back pretty pumped up,

00:13:09.770 --> 00:13:12.450
and people were also
starting to talk

00:13:12.450 --> 00:13:14.210
about opening roles for women.

00:13:14.210 --> 00:13:17.850
And so there was a
lot of commentary

00:13:17.850 --> 00:13:21.110
during some of the sessions
about women flying in combat

00:13:21.110 --> 00:13:23.590
and a lot of negative
reactions from the men.

00:13:23.590 --> 00:13:27.200
So all of this came together.

00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:29.486
Some very wrong things
happened, and then

00:13:29.486 --> 00:13:33.140
the investigation by the
Navy was very hard-handed.

00:13:33.140 --> 00:13:36.510
It just was a really challenging
time to be in the military.

00:13:36.510 --> 00:13:39.440
So then I go to this
F-18 training squadron,

00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:42.970
where at first, I
was the only woman.

00:13:42.970 --> 00:13:46.210
There was another woman
that came through after me.

00:13:46.210 --> 00:13:49.355
But they just were
not happy about having

00:13:49.355 --> 00:13:50.950
a woman come through.

00:13:50.950 --> 00:13:53.180
And I wasn't going
to a combat squadron.

00:13:53.180 --> 00:13:55.250
The law had not
changed by that point.

00:13:55.250 --> 00:13:59.390
But I definitely did
not feel welcome.

00:13:59.390 --> 00:14:01.974
And I think if Tailhook
had not just happened,

00:14:01.974 --> 00:14:03.640
I don't think it
would've been the same.

00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:07.860
I really felt like that set the
stage for what happened there.

00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:10.310
So at that squadron,
someone else

00:14:10.310 --> 00:14:14.000
had posted up an article on a
board about why women shouldn't

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.180
be allowed to fly in combat.

00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:18.650
And I'm the only
female student there,

00:14:18.650 --> 00:14:20.846
so it's like, now what do I do?

00:14:20.846 --> 00:14:22.470
I wasn't sure if I
should say something

00:14:22.470 --> 00:14:24.130
or if I should just let it go.

00:14:24.130 --> 00:14:27.910
And I thought back to how
I had handled the pin-up.

00:14:27.910 --> 00:14:32.650
So I found this letter to the
editor that was really funny.

00:14:32.650 --> 00:14:36.800
It was written by a man who
had just outrageous things

00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:40.110
about why women should not
be allowed to fly in combat--

00:14:40.110 --> 00:14:42.530
things like, if they
pull G's, you know,

00:14:42.530 --> 00:14:44.280
it's going to rip
their uterus out.

00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:45.740
Just really stupid
stuff like that.

00:14:45.740 --> 00:14:50.050
And I thought, OK, I'm going
to one-up you, essentially.

00:14:50.050 --> 00:14:53.100
And that did not go
over well at all.

00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:57.527
It turned out-- the
pin-up was funny.

00:14:57.527 --> 00:14:58.610
This did not go over well.

00:14:58.610 --> 00:15:01.175
I think part of it
was the person who

00:15:01.175 --> 00:15:03.220
had put that article up
was the executive officer

00:15:03.220 --> 00:15:05.530
of the squadron, which is
like the second in command.

00:15:05.530 --> 00:15:08.980
So having leadership essentially
saying we don't really want you

00:15:08.980 --> 00:15:14.170
here, it was tough
to deal with that.

00:15:14.170 --> 00:15:18.400
And then he took his down
and put mine up, and said,

00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:20.890
this is from Lieutenant Draude.

00:15:20.890 --> 00:15:22.820
So then the instructor
started saying

00:15:22.820 --> 00:15:24.530
that I had made
him take his down.

00:15:24.530 --> 00:15:27.750
And it just turned
into this big mess.

00:15:27.750 --> 00:15:31.250
And so what was already really
challenging and difficult just

00:15:31.250 --> 00:15:32.220
became really bad.

00:15:32.220 --> 00:15:35.120
So I barely made it
through that squadron.

00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:39.440
And that, I think, was
a real shock for me

00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:42.270
because I never had
really felt like I

00:15:42.270 --> 00:15:44.380
had experienced discrimination.

00:15:44.380 --> 00:15:48.230
College, in my Navy ROTC
unit, even in flight school

00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:50.380
I felt very supported
along the way.

00:15:50.380 --> 00:15:53.050
But in that squadron, that
was really the first time.

00:15:53.050 --> 00:15:56.410
CELINE: So based on
experiences like that,

00:15:56.410 --> 00:16:00.410
what have you learned as far
as when to fight the system,

00:16:00.410 --> 00:16:05.270
when to play within the
rules, when to let things go?

00:16:05.270 --> 00:16:06.895
What's some advice
that you would have?

00:16:06.895 --> 00:16:08.228
LOREE DRAUDE: It's a tough call.

00:16:08.228 --> 00:16:10.089
I mean, I think back
to that and wonder, OK,

00:16:10.089 --> 00:16:11.755
if I could do it all
over again, would I

00:16:11.755 --> 00:16:13.088
have done something differently?

00:16:13.088 --> 00:16:16.400
Well, the woman who came in
behind me was very quiet.

00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:19.220
She would not engage
like that at all,

00:16:19.220 --> 00:16:21.350
and she made it through.

00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:25.760
I think what I'd
recommend is you really

00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:28.350
have to assess the situation
and know whether or not

00:16:28.350 --> 00:16:31.329
this is an environment where
you can engage like that,

00:16:31.329 --> 00:16:33.120
and if people are going
to appreciate that,

00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:37.420
or if they're going to
really take it the wrong way

00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:41.285
or not appreciate the
effort that you're making.

00:16:41.285 --> 00:16:43.160
I think in the first
example with the pin-up,

00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:46.780
I was with a bunch of
aviators that were my friends,

00:16:46.780 --> 00:16:48.930
and it wasn't as big of a deal.

00:16:48.930 --> 00:16:50.500
In the second,
there was definitely

00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:53.820
a situation where these
instructor pilots were feeling

00:16:53.820 --> 00:16:56.210
like they were being forced
to change and do something

00:16:56.210 --> 00:16:57.960
that they really
didn't want to do.

00:16:57.960 --> 00:17:00.490
And I don't know that
there was anything

00:17:00.490 --> 00:17:02.670
I could have done to
really have been successful

00:17:02.670 --> 00:17:05.200
in that situation.

00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:07.220
So then, when the
law did change and it

00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:09.030
was time for me
to either go back

00:17:09.030 --> 00:17:13.450
to that squadron or transition
to another aircraft,

00:17:13.450 --> 00:17:15.520
I did not go back
to that squadron.

00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:18.150
They did not want me to
come back through there,

00:17:18.150 --> 00:17:19.940
and I could have fought it.

00:17:19.940 --> 00:17:22.920
So that was a choice
where I was deciding,

00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:27.280
do I want to fight
for this, or do I

00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:31.590
want to go deploy
and be part of this?

00:17:31.590 --> 00:17:35.797
And that was a decision
where I said, you know what?

00:17:35.797 --> 00:17:37.430
This battle's not
worth fighting.

00:17:37.430 --> 00:17:41.800
I think I'm going to do more
for women in the military

00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:43.620
by deploying with
a squadron that's

00:17:43.620 --> 00:17:46.480
going to support me and
give me the opportunity

00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:49.180
to be successful
and to do my job,

00:17:49.180 --> 00:17:51.860
rather than keep fighting to
be in a community that really

00:17:51.860 --> 00:17:53.168
doesn't want me in it.

00:17:53.168 --> 00:17:54.920
CELINE: Great.

00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:57.130
In the book, you
mention several times

00:17:57.130 --> 00:17:59.430
where you've modified
your behavior a little bit

00:17:59.430 --> 00:18:00.280
to kind of fit in.

00:18:00.280 --> 00:18:01.890
Can you give us--
you've given us

00:18:01.890 --> 00:18:04.050
a few examples, but
another example of that,

00:18:04.050 --> 00:18:08.444
and how you decide when
and how to do that?

00:18:08.444 --> 00:18:10.610
LOREE DRAUDE: I think being
on the aircraft carrier,

00:18:10.610 --> 00:18:16.450
I slightly modified my
behavior in that I really

00:18:16.450 --> 00:18:18.560
tried to think
about what it must

00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:21.430
be like for all these
men in the Navy,

00:18:21.430 --> 00:18:25.830
on the ship, that are used to
being in the Navy on a ship

00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:27.710
altogether, not
having women around,

00:18:27.710 --> 00:18:30.605
not having to, I don't know--

00:18:30.605 --> 00:18:31.980
CELINE: --be
politically correct.

00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:33.105
LOREE DRAUDE: Yes, exactly.

00:18:33.105 --> 00:18:36.760
Or be polite, or
even-- so I tried

00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:38.990
to think, what would it
be like for them to then

00:18:38.990 --> 00:18:42.690
have this big change
thrust upon them,

00:18:42.690 --> 00:18:45.430
and what are their expectations?

00:18:45.430 --> 00:18:49.390
And I think being
empathetic to that helped.

00:18:49.390 --> 00:18:53.970
And so when I was on the
ship, I didn't wear makeup.

00:18:53.970 --> 00:18:56.980
I never wore perfume.

00:18:56.980 --> 00:18:58.982
I'm never going to be
mistaken for a man.

00:18:58.982 --> 00:18:59.940
I'm definitely a woman.

00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:03.140
So I don't want to
really force it on them

00:19:03.140 --> 00:19:06.530
even more, if that makes sense.

00:19:06.530 --> 00:19:09.990
And I think being in the ready
room, in that environment,

00:19:09.990 --> 00:19:15.120
it is a very rough and
joking environment.

00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:17.980
People are always giving
each other a hard time.

00:19:17.980 --> 00:19:23.940
But it's all done typically
in a sense of bonding,

00:19:23.940 --> 00:19:25.770
with the sense of
bonding where you're

00:19:25.770 --> 00:19:28.700
kind of joking around
with each other.

00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:30.490
CELINE: In the book,
you also talk about,

00:19:30.490 --> 00:19:32.020
at times, being
disappointed at some

00:19:32.020 --> 00:19:33.540
of the behavior of
the other women.

00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:35.450
Can you tell us a
little bit about that,

00:19:35.450 --> 00:19:38.230
if you still feel that way?

00:19:38.230 --> 00:19:39.070
LOREE DRAUDE: Yeah.

00:19:39.070 --> 00:19:42.450
For example, not wearing
makeup and having

00:19:42.450 --> 00:19:43.990
my hair tucked into
my flight suit,

00:19:43.990 --> 00:19:46.357
things like that that I
thought were professional.

00:19:46.357 --> 00:19:48.940
There were some women who were
like, look, I'm going to be me,

00:19:48.940 --> 00:19:50.080
and I don't care.

00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:52.860
And they'd wear red
fingernail polish.

00:19:52.860 --> 00:19:55.750
They'd have their hair flying.

00:19:55.750 --> 00:19:59.720
But for me, it was a
matter of professionalism.

00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:02.780
I mean, now, looking back,
I'm definitely more, I think,

00:20:02.780 --> 00:20:04.100
tolerant.

00:20:04.100 --> 00:20:07.310
Back then I was like, oh,
we have to be very uniform

00:20:07.310 --> 00:20:09.240
and follow the
rules and all that.

00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:14.070
But I think now I am definitely
more relaxed about it.

00:20:14.070 --> 00:20:17.860
And as far as behaviors
and things like that,

00:20:17.860 --> 00:20:20.320
one big thing that comes up
a lot is dating on the ship.

00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:24.870
And again, it's a very
contained environment.

00:20:24.870 --> 00:20:27.630
And having
relationships like that

00:20:27.630 --> 00:20:31.060
are detrimental in my opinion,
because it just takes the focus

00:20:31.060 --> 00:20:32.390
off what we're doing.

00:20:32.390 --> 00:20:35.230
CELINE: So talk about the high
expectations and the pressure.

00:20:35.230 --> 00:20:37.320
How did you personally
deal with that?

00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:41.250
I think Neil alluded to not only
are you getting this extremely

00:20:41.250 --> 00:20:42.730
risky, challenging
job, but you're

00:20:42.730 --> 00:20:46.069
doing it with all 8,000
eyes looking at you.

00:20:46.069 --> 00:20:47.610
LOREE DRAUDE: I had
a great squadron.

00:20:47.610 --> 00:20:50.360
I mean, I was very fortunate.

00:20:50.360 --> 00:20:54.362
The people in my squadron
were just great people.

00:20:54.362 --> 00:20:56.570
I think they appreciated
the stress that I was under,

00:20:56.570 --> 00:21:01.720
and they were just
always supportive of me.

00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:04.590
I joked-- I wrote in the book
one time about how I had one

00:21:04.590 --> 00:21:08.150
really bad night where
I was trying to land.

00:21:08.150 --> 00:21:10.400
Three times I came in
to land, and each time I

00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:13.870
had vultured, which means when
you hit the deck, the hook

00:21:13.870 --> 00:21:16.860
either bounces-- or that's
the excuse you like to say.

00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:18.600
It was a mechanical failure.

00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:21.190
But really I put
too much power on.

00:21:21.190 --> 00:21:22.704
It landed too long.

00:21:22.704 --> 00:21:25.120
The hook [INAUDIBLE] the wire,
so it doesn't grab the wire

00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:27.260
and you go flying again.

00:21:27.260 --> 00:21:28.140
We got back.

00:21:28.140 --> 00:21:30.190
Finally, I landed
on the fourth time.

00:21:30.190 --> 00:21:33.940
It was humiliating, because like
Neil said, everyone's watching.

00:21:33.940 --> 00:21:37.800
This is like everyone gets
popcorn and sits down and is

00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:39.300
watching the landings.

00:21:39.300 --> 00:21:43.930
And I was just like,
I'm just embarrassing.

00:21:43.930 --> 00:21:45.980
I'm embarrassing my squadron.

00:21:45.980 --> 00:21:47.424
I'm embarrassing women.

00:21:47.424 --> 00:21:49.590
There was a lot of pressure
I was putting on myself.

00:21:49.590 --> 00:21:51.465
But we get out of the
jet and one of the guys

00:21:51.465 --> 00:21:54.610
was like, hey, thanks for
the extra flight time.

00:21:54.610 --> 00:21:56.570
They were always trying
to find the positive.

00:21:56.570 --> 00:22:00.025
And so that was really helpful,
feeling like I was supported.

00:22:00.025 --> 00:22:00.900
CELINE: That's great.

00:22:00.900 --> 00:22:03.230
And what do you think was
different about that squadron

00:22:03.230 --> 00:22:05.020
than the other
squadron where you

00:22:05.020 --> 00:22:07.100
had the hostile environment?

00:22:07.100 --> 00:22:08.380
Was it the leadership?

00:22:08.380 --> 00:22:09.240
Just the people?

00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:10.050
A culture?

00:22:10.050 --> 00:22:11.924
LOREE DRAUDE: It's
definitely the leadership.

00:22:11.924 --> 00:22:13.990
I can't emphasize that enough.

00:22:13.990 --> 00:22:16.630
There were fighter
squadrons in our airway,

00:22:16.630 --> 00:22:19.620
and some of my
friends were-- well,

00:22:19.620 --> 00:22:22.770
I had female pilot friends
in some of those squadrons,

00:22:22.770 --> 00:22:25.490
and it was really
challenging for them.

00:22:25.490 --> 00:22:29.390
And I think it's because the
leaders in those squadrons,

00:22:29.390 --> 00:22:30.660
their attitude was, OK.

00:22:30.660 --> 00:22:33.240
We're being forced to
take these women with us.

00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:34.560
Let's just get through it.

00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:38.020
And some of them,
they adopted what

00:22:38.020 --> 00:22:40.350
they called a gender
neutral policy, which

00:22:40.350 --> 00:22:42.790
meant that you can't give
anybody special treatment.

00:22:42.790 --> 00:22:45.960
They were so afraid of being
perceived as giving women

00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:48.050
special treatment
that, if anything,

00:22:48.050 --> 00:22:52.100
they didn't give the people
who needed help enough help.

00:22:52.100 --> 00:22:58.980
And so I was very lucky that
I had a commanding officer who

00:22:58.980 --> 00:23:01.364
would stand up for all the
people in his squadron.

00:23:01.364 --> 00:23:03.530
And I never felt like he
was standing up more for me

00:23:03.530 --> 00:23:04.446
because I was a woman.

00:23:04.446 --> 00:23:08.330
I just felt like all the junior
officers in that squadron

00:23:08.330 --> 00:23:09.285
can count on him.

00:23:12.410 --> 00:23:16.260
When we had bad landings or did
something stupid on the flight

00:23:16.260 --> 00:23:19.660
deck, the officer who's
in charge of all that

00:23:19.660 --> 00:23:22.320
is called the air boss, and
he sits up there in the tower

00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:24.890
and is watching over everything
happening on the deck.

00:23:24.890 --> 00:23:27.950
And he'll say, OK, who's
the pilot in that jet?

00:23:27.950 --> 00:23:30.470
I want to see him or her.

00:23:30.470 --> 00:23:32.270
And my commanding
officer's policy

00:23:32.270 --> 00:23:34.710
was he was the one who was
going to go up and catch

00:23:34.710 --> 00:23:36.280
flak for whatever we had done.

00:23:36.280 --> 00:23:38.600
And then he'd come back
and tell us, OK, here's

00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:39.641
what you could do better.

00:23:39.641 --> 00:23:40.730
So he was a great leader.

00:23:40.730 --> 00:23:44.380
And even in my squadron,
there were actually--

00:23:44.380 --> 00:23:46.510
I was surprised
later to find out

00:23:46.510 --> 00:23:48.080
that a lot of the
men in my squadron

00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:51.900
were not happy about the change,
about having women integrated.

00:23:51.900 --> 00:23:54.960
But they were so
professional that they

00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:57.800
put their personal feelings
aside and figured out, OK,

00:23:57.800 --> 00:23:59.605
we're going to make this work.

00:23:59.605 --> 00:24:02.050
CELINE: That's great
So for the civilians

00:24:02.050 --> 00:24:04.040
in the audience
like myself, can you

00:24:04.040 --> 00:24:06.720
tell us a little bit more
what life on a ship is like?

00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:08.130
What's the hardest
part about it?

00:24:08.130 --> 00:24:09.921
What is something that
we wouldn't imagine?

00:24:17.490 --> 00:24:21.310
LOREE DRAUDE: It's a really
unique environment, obviously.

00:24:21.310 --> 00:24:23.730
I think for aviators, it's
very different than the rest

00:24:23.730 --> 00:24:24.870
of the ship's crew.

00:24:24.870 --> 00:24:25.700
We're very lucky.

00:24:25.700 --> 00:24:29.420
As aviators, we get to leave
the ship for a few hours,

00:24:29.420 --> 00:24:31.770
go fly, and then come back.

00:24:31.770 --> 00:24:34.260
Living on the carrier is
challenging because everything

00:24:34.260 --> 00:24:37.269
is contained, and if there's
something you need and it's not

00:24:37.269 --> 00:24:38.810
on the ship, then
you're out of luck.

00:24:38.810 --> 00:24:40.810
And when I went through
my first deployment,

00:24:40.810 --> 00:24:42.010
we didn't even have email.

00:24:42.010 --> 00:24:45.350
So the only contact we really
had with the outside world

00:24:45.350 --> 00:24:47.670
was if you got mail,
that got delivered,

00:24:47.670 --> 00:24:52.190
or if you got a phone card,
you could call back home.

00:24:52.190 --> 00:24:53.960
But people couldn't call you.

00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:56.517
So I think the most
difficult thing was just

00:24:56.517 --> 00:24:58.600
feeling so disconnected
from the rest of the world

00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:01.990
sometimes and wondering if
anyone back home is thinking

00:25:01.990 --> 00:25:04.230
about you or caring
what's going on.

00:25:04.230 --> 00:25:06.210
So that's tough.

00:25:06.210 --> 00:25:09.532
After being out at sea for
awhile, the food is horrible.

00:25:09.532 --> 00:25:11.460
It's so bad.

00:25:11.460 --> 00:25:13.600
And I was a vegetarian
on my second deployment,

00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:15.850
which is insane.

00:25:15.850 --> 00:25:18.300
My squadron mates,
they'd joke with me.

00:25:18.300 --> 00:25:21.160
They were like, are you taking
a POW correspondence course?

00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:22.550
Why are you eating this?

00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:33.180
So when we'd go pull into
port every three weeks or so

00:25:33.180 --> 00:25:36.750
and go on liberty, we'd always
go to a really nice restaurant.

00:25:36.750 --> 00:25:37.980
CELINE: Very nice.

00:25:37.980 --> 00:25:40.710
With that, I'm
conscious of time.

00:25:40.710 --> 00:25:43.600
I want to open up to
anyone in the audience

00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:45.094
for some questions for Loree.

00:25:45.094 --> 00:25:46.510
AUDIENCE: Can you
share how you've

00:25:46.510 --> 00:25:48.140
translated some of
those experiences

00:25:48.140 --> 00:25:51.760
into civilian and your
professional life today?

00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:58.440
LOREE DRAUDE: I think being
in an environment that

00:25:58.440 --> 00:26:02.070
is new and different and
understanding that everybody's

00:26:02.070 --> 00:26:04.550
got their own things going
on, their own issues,

00:26:04.550 --> 00:26:08.370
and getting to know people more.

00:26:08.370 --> 00:26:13.130
That, for me, I
think, is an effect

00:26:13.130 --> 00:26:15.690
of growing up in so
many different places.

00:26:15.690 --> 00:26:18.430
And I think that's one of the
reasons why the military was

00:26:18.430 --> 00:26:19.940
a good fit for
me, was that I was

00:26:19.940 --> 00:26:23.230
used to working with a lot
of different types of people.

00:26:23.230 --> 00:26:26.940
And in the civilian world,
making the transition to that,

00:26:26.940 --> 00:26:30.580
I think having worked in
a resource-constrained

00:26:30.580 --> 00:26:32.290
environment in the
military and being

00:26:32.290 --> 00:26:34.729
able to identify with
different people,

00:26:34.729 --> 00:26:35.895
I think that's been helpful.

00:26:38.410 --> 00:26:41.230
I also think that even
though the military trains

00:26:41.230 --> 00:26:44.990
us to be very specific
about how we react

00:26:44.990 --> 00:26:47.310
to different
situations, there are so

00:26:47.310 --> 00:26:50.130
many things that happen
where they're ambiguous.

00:26:50.130 --> 00:26:52.580
You're just like, well, OK.

00:26:52.580 --> 00:26:54.980
This isn't in my checklist.

00:26:54.980 --> 00:26:57.560
I don't have the emergency
procedure checklist for this.

00:26:57.560 --> 00:27:00.380
But the military
training is so solid

00:27:00.380 --> 00:27:02.920
that it does enable
you to, I think,

00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:04.360
trust your instincts
and your gut,

00:27:04.360 --> 00:27:06.240
and leverage that
to make a decision.

00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:11.190
So I would say
just the experience

00:27:11.190 --> 00:27:15.381
I had dealing with
resource-constrained

00:27:15.381 --> 00:27:17.380
environments, a lot of
different types of people

00:27:17.380 --> 00:27:19.440
with different backgrounds,
different attitudes,

00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:23.252
and really trying to connect
with them on a level somehow,

00:27:23.252 --> 00:27:24.085
that's been helpful.

00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:28.300
AUDIENCE: In this
job and other jobs,

00:27:28.300 --> 00:27:29.940
was your experience
that as a vet,

00:27:29.940 --> 00:27:32.350
you were sort of put
to the top of the list?

00:27:32.350 --> 00:27:34.530
Or was it something
different, where as a vet,

00:27:34.530 --> 00:27:38.999
you were considered to be
maybe a risk of some sort?

00:27:38.999 --> 00:27:39.790
LOREE DRAUDE: Yeah.

00:27:39.790 --> 00:27:43.730
There are a lot of stereotypes
about veterans, good and bad.

00:27:43.730 --> 00:27:48.430
And I think that every
person's unique, obviously.

00:27:48.430 --> 00:27:52.050
I can recall people
in previous roles,

00:27:52.050 --> 00:27:54.850
like when I worked in
management consulting,

00:27:54.850 --> 00:27:57.626
someone made the comment--
we were looking at a review

00:27:57.626 --> 00:27:59.500
board and a promotion
board, and someone made

00:27:59.500 --> 00:28:02.520
the comment with me in the room,
knowing that I was a veteran,

00:28:02.520 --> 00:28:04.850
you know, I don't normally
like to promote veterans.

00:28:04.850 --> 00:28:06.590
They just typically
don't do well here.

00:28:06.590 --> 00:28:09.090
And it's like, what?

00:28:09.090 --> 00:28:10.510
It was kind of shocking.

00:28:10.510 --> 00:28:12.120
Because I do think
that veterans bring

00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:15.240
a lot of very positive skills
to the workplace, specifically

00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:16.910
the business workplace.

00:28:16.910 --> 00:28:20.610
I think a lot of challenges
that veterans have is just

00:28:20.610 --> 00:28:23.330
translating their skills
and really understanding

00:28:23.330 --> 00:28:26.980
that, even though the civilian
environment is different,

00:28:26.980 --> 00:28:29.470
in a lot of ways, what
they've done in the military

00:28:29.470 --> 00:28:33.100
is so relevant and applicable
to the civilian world.

00:28:33.100 --> 00:28:36.720
And when I transitioned
15 years ago,

00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:39.180
I can still remember
just how much anxiety

00:28:39.180 --> 00:28:41.060
I had about that transition.

00:28:41.060 --> 00:28:43.800
Because growing up
in the Marine Corps

00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:46.350
and then being in the
Navy for 10 years,

00:28:46.350 --> 00:28:48.910
the civilian world looked scary.

00:28:48.910 --> 00:28:51.844
I mean, after my
experiences, I don't

00:28:51.844 --> 00:28:53.510
know if I really
trust civilians.

00:28:53.510 --> 00:28:57.400
It's just so different
than what I'm used to.

00:28:57.400 --> 00:29:01.620
And so I think
now, looking back,

00:29:01.620 --> 00:29:04.130
it's just so obvious to me.

00:29:04.130 --> 00:29:07.227
And I've learned
to appreciate how

00:29:07.227 --> 00:29:09.310
challenging it is for a
lot of people getting out,

00:29:09.310 --> 00:29:10.643
having been through that myself.

00:29:10.643 --> 00:29:14.590
So one of the things I just
really love about Google

00:29:14.590 --> 00:29:17.650
is how much outreach
they're doing for veterans

00:29:17.650 --> 00:29:20.270
and how much they're helping
them with that transition

00:29:20.270 --> 00:29:22.390
and easing their fears,
but also really helping

00:29:22.390 --> 00:29:26.430
to prepare them for how
to translate what they did

00:29:26.430 --> 00:29:30.700
in the military to what they
might do in the civilian world.

00:29:30.700 --> 00:29:34.450
Because there are a lot of
things that translate well,

00:29:34.450 --> 00:29:37.960
but you just don't know how
to say it in civilian speak.

00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:41.640
So we have to keep
helping the veterans

00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:43.770
with how they can do that.

00:29:43.770 --> 00:29:47.110
AUDIENCE: Did you ever feel
like there were instances

00:29:47.110 --> 00:29:50.530
of discrimination or things
that maybe weren't big enough

00:29:50.530 --> 00:29:55.170
to bring to your superiors,
but you kind of struggled with,

00:29:55.170 --> 00:29:58.870
do I make a big deal
about this, or is this

00:29:58.870 --> 00:30:01.214
going to cause more people
to be annoyed with me?

00:30:01.214 --> 00:30:03.005
I don't know if you
can share an experience

00:30:03.005 --> 00:30:05.110
like that or example.

00:30:05.110 --> 00:30:06.600
You could probably
think of many.

00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:07.391
LOREE DRAUDE: Yeah.

00:30:07.391 --> 00:30:10.480
There are definitely many.

00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:13.020
And I think any
time it happened,

00:30:13.020 --> 00:30:16.070
I just had to think
of the circumstances.

00:30:16.070 --> 00:30:19.070
What was this person-- there
were so many times when people

00:30:19.070 --> 00:30:22.180
would say things where I really
don't believe that they meant

00:30:22.180 --> 00:30:24.470
to be discriminatory, or
they just didn't really

00:30:24.470 --> 00:30:28.550
realize the words coming
out of their mouth.

00:30:28.550 --> 00:30:31.527
There were many times when the
guys that were in my squadron

00:30:31.527 --> 00:30:33.235
would say something
really inappropriate,

00:30:33.235 --> 00:30:34.960
and then they're
like, oh, sorry Loree.

00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:36.110
We forgot that you were a woman.

00:30:36.110 --> 00:30:36.790
And I'm like, OK.

00:30:36.790 --> 00:30:37.956
I think that's a compliment.

00:30:41.300 --> 00:30:44.910
So I would really think about
what the circumstances were.

00:30:48.520 --> 00:30:51.190
When we go out to do
the carrier training,

00:30:51.190 --> 00:30:53.970
that's the first time that
we officially get call signs.

00:30:53.970 --> 00:30:56.890
Because you get a fun
patch for everything.

00:30:56.890 --> 00:30:58.057
I have my jacket over there.

00:30:58.057 --> 00:30:59.723
And there are a lot
of different patches

00:30:59.723 --> 00:31:01.150
that we like to
have in the Navy.

00:31:01.150 --> 00:31:03.650
And you get a name patch, and
you get your call sign on it.

00:31:03.650 --> 00:31:05.720
So there was a list
up on the board

00:31:05.720 --> 00:31:10.470
where people could go and write
call signs, your recommended

00:31:10.470 --> 00:31:11.710
call signs for people.

00:31:11.710 --> 00:31:15.540
And typically in the Navy,
Air Force, and Marine Corps

00:31:15.540 --> 00:31:18.610
as well, your call sign is
either based on your last name

00:31:18.610 --> 00:31:20.600
or on something stupid
that you've done.

00:31:20.600 --> 00:31:24.680
And so I wasn't sure what
was going to go up there.

00:31:24.680 --> 00:31:28.000
And so under my name, there
were some very typical

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:31.400
feminine things like Braids,
because I would braid my hair.

00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:34.480
And I think Rowdy was up there
because it rhymed with Draude.

00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:35.820
And someone had put Drano.

00:31:35.820 --> 00:31:37.170
And I was like, Drano?

00:31:37.170 --> 00:31:38.630
I don't get that.

00:31:38.630 --> 00:31:41.690
And I asked some of
my fellow students,

00:31:41.690 --> 00:31:42.940
and they looked uncomfortable.

00:31:42.940 --> 00:31:43.606
I'm like, uh-oh.

00:31:43.606 --> 00:31:45.090
OK, what does that mean?

00:31:45.090 --> 00:31:47.490
And they're like, oh,
Drano, like a pipe cleaner.

00:31:47.490 --> 00:31:49.990
I'm like, still not
getting you, because I

00:31:49.990 --> 00:31:51.300
was raised Catholic School.

00:31:51.300 --> 00:31:52.070
So I'm like, what?

00:31:52.070 --> 00:31:54.570
And they're like, you
know, you give blow jobs.

00:31:54.570 --> 00:31:56.180
I'm like, what?

00:31:56.180 --> 00:31:59.760
I was so offended and pissed.

00:31:59.760 --> 00:32:03.830
I was really shocked that
anyone would say that.

00:32:03.830 --> 00:32:05.200
And I have no idea who wrote it.

00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:08.170
So at that point,
it's like, first, I

00:32:08.170 --> 00:32:11.070
have no idea how I'm going
to prove who wrote that.

00:32:11.070 --> 00:32:12.570
And I'm like, the
guy is an asshole,

00:32:12.570 --> 00:32:14.490
so I'm not going to
bother with this.

00:32:14.490 --> 00:32:17.110
And so that was one example.

00:32:17.110 --> 00:32:18.790
There are just a lot
of things like that

00:32:18.790 --> 00:32:22.650
that happen where you just--
in that situation, I assessed,

00:32:22.650 --> 00:32:25.470
OK, this is not going to
have wider implications.

00:32:25.470 --> 00:32:30.850
Most of the guys around
me know that that's not

00:32:30.850 --> 00:32:32.760
the type of person I
am, or I don't know,

00:32:32.760 --> 00:32:35.420
that it's just not
really appropriate,

00:32:35.420 --> 00:32:40.989
and that it wasn't going
to be worth fighting for.

00:32:40.989 --> 00:32:42.030
AUDIENCE: So I'm curious.

00:32:42.030 --> 00:32:44.390
You mentioned
several areas where

00:32:44.390 --> 00:32:46.920
there were discriminatory
practices, sometimes

00:32:46.920 --> 00:32:49.410
unintentional, or
hostile work environment.

00:32:49.410 --> 00:32:52.080
I'm curious if you've ever
seen anything, probably

00:32:52.080 --> 00:32:55.790
on a much milder scale, here
at Google, either unconscious

00:32:55.790 --> 00:32:57.310
bias, that kind of thing.

00:32:57.310 --> 00:33:00.590
One Googler recently had a
very interesting post where she

00:33:00.590 --> 00:33:03.570
shared her experiences about how
many of the off-sites and fun

00:33:03.570 --> 00:33:04.970
events seem kind
of like "bro-y".

00:33:04.970 --> 00:33:07.090
And [INAUDIBLE] in
[INAUDIBLE], so they

00:33:07.090 --> 00:33:10.840
would go out drinking and stuff,
and she felt very left out.

00:33:10.840 --> 00:33:13.460
LOREE DRAUDE: Yeah.

00:33:13.460 --> 00:33:15.420
I've been at Google
for a year and a half,

00:33:15.420 --> 00:33:17.820
and I've been really impressed
by the unconscious bias

00:33:17.820 --> 00:33:19.935
training and the bias
busting workshops

00:33:19.935 --> 00:33:21.710
that are following on from that.

00:33:21.710 --> 00:33:24.400
I wish that the military
would do something like that.

00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:26.420
Because there's plenty
of conscious bias

00:33:26.420 --> 00:33:29.640
that happens, and
some people are still

00:33:29.640 --> 00:33:34.800
very open about their feelings
about different issues.

00:33:34.800 --> 00:33:38.490
I mean, I've never seen anything
like what happened in the Navy.

00:33:38.490 --> 00:33:41.480
But I will say that
I think it's still

00:33:41.480 --> 00:33:45.230
the case where just
the words that we use

00:33:45.230 --> 00:33:49.120
and the language that we use
and even things like off-sites,

00:33:49.120 --> 00:33:53.896
people aren't always as
inclusive or thoughtful

00:33:53.896 --> 00:33:55.020
about some of those things.

00:33:55.020 --> 00:33:55.936
And it's just natural.

00:33:55.936 --> 00:33:58.460
I think that it's an evolution.

00:33:58.460 --> 00:34:00.847
And the more diverse we
make our environment,

00:34:00.847 --> 00:34:03.055
the more we have to be
thoughtful about those things.

00:34:06.080 --> 00:34:07.790
In my org we have a
couple of Googlers

00:34:07.790 --> 00:34:13.230
who have physical
challenges that

00:34:13.230 --> 00:34:15.440
have to be incorporated
into our off-site plans.

00:34:15.440 --> 00:34:16.354
And it's like, OK.

00:34:16.354 --> 00:34:17.270
That's not a big deal.

00:34:17.270 --> 00:34:20.460
I think it's just
something that if you

00:34:20.460 --> 00:34:22.280
want to have an
inclusive culture

00:34:22.280 --> 00:34:24.850
and hire the best
people, then you

00:34:24.850 --> 00:34:27.969
need to make sure that you
are creating a culture where

00:34:27.969 --> 00:34:31.469
all those types of people
are going to feel included.

00:34:31.469 --> 00:34:32.219
It's funny though.

00:34:32.219 --> 00:34:33.750
There are things
that seem really

00:34:33.750 --> 00:34:37.060
small that still are a factor.

00:34:37.060 --> 00:34:38.770
Even on my team,
I've been trying

00:34:38.770 --> 00:34:41.620
not to say "hey
you guys" anymore.

00:34:41.620 --> 00:34:44.800
Things that I grew up with that
now that I think about them,

00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:45.760
it's like oh, yes.

00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:48.880
That can make some
people feel excluded.

00:34:48.880 --> 00:34:50.920
And even though I
think most people think

00:34:50.920 --> 00:34:53.659
of it in the generic
sense, you're

00:34:53.659 --> 00:34:57.910
talking about guys, not gals.

00:34:57.910 --> 00:35:01.260
So there are just things
like that, words or language

00:35:01.260 --> 00:35:04.530
that, I think, is part of how
we speak that we might want

00:35:04.530 --> 00:35:08.770
to reconsider because it still
can sometimes feel exclusive.

00:35:08.770 --> 00:35:11.280
AUDIENCE: You said you were
born into a military family,

00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:15.550
and that you were
going into a field

00:35:15.550 --> 00:35:17.770
where there's not much women.

00:35:17.770 --> 00:35:20.780
And you experienced a lot
of hardships along the way.

00:35:20.780 --> 00:35:24.630
Who did you confide in, and who
were your instrumental friends

00:35:24.630 --> 00:35:25.320
and confidantes?

00:35:25.320 --> 00:35:27.440
You mentioned that you
had a great mentor,

00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:30.880
as well, who was
it your squadron.

00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:33.890
And also, I wanted to find out
the second piece, which is,

00:35:33.890 --> 00:35:35.517
I think you're a Googler?

00:35:35.517 --> 00:35:36.100
I see a badge.

00:35:36.100 --> 00:35:36.510
LOREE DRAUDE: I am.

00:35:36.510 --> 00:35:37.080
Yeah.

00:35:37.080 --> 00:35:40.230
AUDIENCE: What led you, then,
to also decide to leave?

00:35:40.230 --> 00:35:41.660
LOREE DRAUDE: Yeah.

00:35:41.660 --> 00:35:46.740
So when I was in
the Navy, my parents

00:35:46.740 --> 00:35:51.060
were huge pillars of
support-- especially my dad

00:35:51.060 --> 00:35:54.500
because he had a long
career in the military.

00:35:54.500 --> 00:35:57.570
He knew what it was
like to lose people

00:35:57.570 --> 00:36:02.150
that you had served with
much more than I did.

00:36:02.150 --> 00:36:04.520
On my first deployment,
we lost like 11 people.

00:36:04.520 --> 00:36:07.410
It was a lot for a deployment.

00:36:07.410 --> 00:36:09.480
But as an infantry
officer in Vietnam,

00:36:09.480 --> 00:36:11.650
he had dealt with that
on a much bigger basis.

00:36:11.650 --> 00:36:13.440
So I think my parents
are definitely

00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:17.420
a huge-- they were
amazing for support.

00:36:17.420 --> 00:36:20.830
I had some friends, other
women that I had gone through

00:36:20.830 --> 00:36:22.510
with that were on
the ship with me,

00:36:22.510 --> 00:36:24.930
and they were also
great support.

00:36:24.930 --> 00:36:28.480
We would get together
and share experiences

00:36:28.480 --> 00:36:34.370
and commiserate sometimes, but
also help boost each other up.

00:36:34.370 --> 00:36:36.900
My squadron was also amazing.

00:36:36.900 --> 00:36:38.710
I had a couple of
different friends

00:36:38.710 --> 00:36:43.150
in my squadron that got
beyond their personal biases

00:36:43.150 --> 00:36:46.390
and were there to
help me be successful.

00:36:46.390 --> 00:36:49.756
So I think that
really helped as well.

00:36:49.756 --> 00:36:50.880
At the time, I was married.

00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:53.090
So my husband was
also in the military,

00:36:53.090 --> 00:36:55.110
and he could appreciate
what was happening.

00:36:55.110 --> 00:36:58.565
And so just having that support
back home was also helpful.

00:36:58.565 --> 00:37:00.190
So I had a really
good support network,

00:37:00.190 --> 00:37:01.898
and I think that's
one of the things that

00:37:01.898 --> 00:37:04.560
really helped me be successful.

00:37:04.560 --> 00:37:06.610
The second part about
why did I get out

00:37:06.610 --> 00:37:09.540
of the Navy, a couple
different things.

00:37:09.540 --> 00:37:11.940
I reached the point where
my commitment was up.

00:37:11.940 --> 00:37:14.000
So as a pilot, I had
to serve seven years

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:16.050
after I got my wings, and
it took me three years

00:37:16.050 --> 00:37:16.970
to get wings.

00:37:16.970 --> 00:37:20.095
This was back when we had
a lot of budget cutbacks,

00:37:20.095 --> 00:37:22.590
so it took awhile to get
through the training program.

00:37:22.590 --> 00:37:24.280
So by the time it was
all said and done,

00:37:24.280 --> 00:37:26.280
I could finally get out,
it was 10 years anyway.

00:37:26.280 --> 00:37:29.650
So I was weighing, OK, do I
stay in another 10 and retire,

00:37:29.650 --> 00:37:30.520
or do I get out?

00:37:30.520 --> 00:37:34.155
And there were a few
things about the military

00:37:34.155 --> 00:37:34.974
I did not like.

00:37:34.974 --> 00:37:36.640
I think having grown
up in the military,

00:37:36.640 --> 00:37:39.280
I was so used to being
told where to go and live

00:37:39.280 --> 00:37:40.160
and what to do.

00:37:40.160 --> 00:37:44.170
And I was like, I want to
go live in San Francisco.

00:37:44.170 --> 00:37:46.890
And I want to go
live here or there.

00:37:46.890 --> 00:37:50.750
And I want to travel
whenever I want to.

00:37:50.750 --> 00:37:52.290
I wanted more
control over my life.

00:37:52.290 --> 00:37:55.220
That was really the main reason.

00:37:55.220 --> 00:37:59.510
Secondary to that was, in
the Navy, if I stayed in,

00:37:59.510 --> 00:38:04.440
the jobs I would be doing would
be more desk jobs, more staff

00:38:04.440 --> 00:38:06.050
jobs, and I really liked flying.

00:38:06.050 --> 00:38:07.550
I really liked being
on the carrier.

00:38:07.550 --> 00:38:08.966
I wanted to do
more of that, and I

00:38:08.966 --> 00:38:10.900
knew that my options for
doing that were going

00:38:10.900 --> 00:38:13.787
to decrease the longer I was in.

00:38:13.787 --> 00:38:15.370
And I knew I wanted
to start a family.

00:38:15.370 --> 00:38:18.730
So I just have
the utmost respect

00:38:18.730 --> 00:38:20.840
for our military
service members who

00:38:20.840 --> 00:38:23.700
serve while having children.

00:38:23.700 --> 00:38:26.570
And I didn't know
if I could do that.

00:38:26.570 --> 00:38:28.153
I had two dogs when
I was in the Navy,

00:38:28.153 --> 00:38:29.652
and it was hard
enough leaving them.

00:38:29.652 --> 00:38:32.110
I was like, if I can't leave
my four-legged children,

00:38:32.110 --> 00:38:35.860
how am I going to leave
two-legged children?

00:38:35.860 --> 00:38:37.770
So all those things
came together

00:38:37.770 --> 00:38:40.830
and I decided to
leave the service.

00:38:40.830 --> 00:38:43.080
CELINE: I'll round out the
talk with the last question

00:38:43.080 --> 00:38:47.050
on, based on your experiences,
any learnings that you want

00:38:47.050 --> 00:38:50.369
to share with the
group or key takeaways?

00:38:50.369 --> 00:38:51.160
LOREE DRAUDE: Yeah.

00:38:51.160 --> 00:38:55.090
I think for me, what made
the biggest difference was

00:38:55.090 --> 00:38:59.880
leadership in the Navy, and
particularly in our air wing.

00:38:59.880 --> 00:39:03.040
We were the first air wing
in the Navy on the West Coast

00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:05.460
to deploy, but a few
months before we deployed,

00:39:05.460 --> 00:39:07.870
there was an air wing on the
East Coast that deployed.

00:39:07.870 --> 00:39:10.930
And they did not have any
of the issues that we had.

00:39:13.910 --> 00:39:19.800
A couple of the female
aviators were the top landers--

00:39:19.800 --> 00:39:20.860
we call them "Top Hook."

00:39:20.860 --> 00:39:24.250
It means that you have some
of the best landing grades.

00:39:24.250 --> 00:39:26.450
The women there felt supported.

00:39:26.450 --> 00:39:28.700
It was a very different
experience for the women

00:39:28.700 --> 00:39:32.810
on-- it was the "Eisenhower."

00:39:32.810 --> 00:39:36.220
In our air wing, it was
quite a bit different.

00:39:36.220 --> 00:39:38.884
So the first time
we deployed, they

00:39:38.884 --> 00:39:40.300
made us all take
a pregnancy test.

00:39:40.300 --> 00:39:41.758
So there was this
feeling like they

00:39:41.758 --> 00:39:43.400
didn't trust us to be ready.

00:39:43.400 --> 00:39:46.500
And there were just
many other things, too.

00:39:46.500 --> 00:39:50.224
And so I think having
strong leadership,

00:39:50.224 --> 00:39:52.515
that would've made a huge
difference for our deployment

00:39:52.515 --> 00:39:56.090
if we'd had better
leadership at the very top.

00:39:56.090 --> 00:39:59.020
Like I mentioned before, my
squadron commanding officer

00:39:59.020 --> 00:40:01.760
was wonderful, and that make
a huge difference for me.

00:40:01.760 --> 00:40:03.550
So I think you really
have to have leaders

00:40:03.550 --> 00:40:08.940
who make sure that the
culture supports that change.

00:40:08.940 --> 00:40:11.380
And then I would
also say what helped

00:40:11.380 --> 00:40:16.010
me was just being empathetic to
the other people I was serving

00:40:16.010 --> 00:40:17.770
with and what their
experience must

00:40:17.770 --> 00:40:23.390
have been like to have this huge
change really pushed on them.

00:40:23.390 --> 00:40:26.440
But then also for me being
put into that situation,

00:40:26.440 --> 00:40:29.760
how could we both be
respectful of the concerns

00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:31.440
we had about each other.

00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:32.820
I was worried that
I wasn't going

00:40:32.820 --> 00:40:34.570
to get a fair shake
because I was a woman,

00:40:34.570 --> 00:40:35.680
and they were
worried that I wasn't

00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:37.221
going to cut it
because I was a woman

00:40:37.221 --> 00:40:39.930
and maybe wasn't getting
the training I needed.

00:40:39.930 --> 00:40:42.010
So being empathetic.

00:40:42.010 --> 00:40:43.560
Then finally, humor.

00:40:43.560 --> 00:40:46.510
That got me through a lot.

00:40:46.510 --> 00:40:48.670
I think, especially, too,
with carrier aviation,

00:40:48.670 --> 00:40:51.520
it's literally life
and death environment.

00:40:51.520 --> 00:40:57.790
And I think because of that,
aviators tend to have, I think,

00:40:57.790 --> 00:41:01.360
a more wicked sense
of humor about things.

00:41:01.360 --> 00:41:03.087
So leadership,
empathy, and humor.

00:41:03.087 --> 00:41:03.670
CELINE: Great.

00:41:03.670 --> 00:41:05.680
Thank you, Loree, for your time.

00:41:05.680 --> 00:41:06.580
Happy Veteran's Day.

00:41:06.580 --> 00:41:09.330
[APPLAUSE]
