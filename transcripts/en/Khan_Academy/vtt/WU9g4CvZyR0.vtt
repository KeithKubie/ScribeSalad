00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:03.140
Some ordered pairs
for a linear function

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:06.340
of x are given in
the table below.

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:08.650
Which equation was used
to generate this table?

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:10.275
So they give us a
bunch of data points.

00:00:10.275 --> 00:00:11.960
When x is 4, y is negative 8.

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:15.310
When x is 7, y is negative
20, so on and so forth.

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:18.530
And these points
have been generated

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:21.170
by one of these equations
right over here,

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:23.120
so let's just see which
of these equations

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:25.531
actually could have generated
all of these points.

00:00:25.531 --> 00:00:27.530
So let's go to this first
point right over here,

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:30.850
4 comma negative 8, and let's
go equation by equation.

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:36.177
If x is 4 here, negative 2
times 4 would be negative 8.

00:00:36.177 --> 00:00:37.260
Let me just write it down.

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.310
We'd multiply negative 2
times 4 to get negative 8,

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:45.380
and then I would add
1 to get negative 7.

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:46.570
I would get negative 7.

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:49.940
So for this equation,
when x is 4,

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.620
y would be negative
7, not negative 8.

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:55.980
So this equation
definitely did not

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.312
generate this top
point right over here.

00:00:58.312 --> 00:00:59.520
So we could just rule it out.

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.150
Whatever equation
should have been

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:02.670
able to generate
for any given x,

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.140
for any of these x's, should
generate this y right over

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:06.080
here.

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.030
Now let's go to
this next equation.

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:11.070
y is equal to
negative 2x plus 0.

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.430
So when x is 4, y would
be negative 2 times

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:15.760
4, which is negative 8.

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:18.200
So this second
equation seems to be

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.620
capable of generating
this first set of points.

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:22.700
When x is 4, y is negative 8.

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.640
But let's see if it
works for this second one

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:25.810
right over here.

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:28.760
When x is 7, you
would have negative 2

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:34.100
times 7, which is negative
14, but here, when x is 7,

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:35.830
y is negative 20.

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:39.720
So this one, we can rule
out, because when x is 7,

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.361
y does not equal negative
20 like this point right

00:01:42.361 --> 00:01:42.860
over here.

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:44.870
So we'll rule that
second one out.

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:46.260
Now let's look at
this third one.

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.600
y is equal to
negative 4x plus 8.

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.830
Well, we could go to
this first point again.

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:53.800
When x is 4, let's think about
what happens when x is 4.

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.390
So when x is 4,
you have negative 4

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:03.830
times 4, which is negative 16,
plus 8, which is negative 8.

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:07.460
So it seems to be able to
generate this first point.

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.490
When x is 4, y is negative 8 for
this equation right over here.

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:15.590
Now let's see what
happens when x is 7.

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:20.560
So negative 4 times
7 is negative 28.

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.010
Negative 28 plus
8 is negative 20,

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.870
so this candidate is
starting to look pretty good.

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:27.650
It's pretty good.

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.780
It satisfies these two
points, and frankly,

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.720
for any of these linear
functions, if it satisfies

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.710
any of these two points, if some
linear function generated all

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:41.130
of these, if some function
can generate any two of them,

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:44.521
it will satisfy all of these,
because two points define

00:02:44.521 --> 00:02:45.020
a line.

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:47.200
But we can verify
it right over here.

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.650
So let's see what
happens when x equals 8.

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:57.700
Negative 4 times 8 is negative
32, plus 8 is negative 24.

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.970
So that satisfies so that when x
is 8, y does equal negative 24.

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:05.340
And then finally, let's
look at that last point.

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:10.070
When x is 9, negative 4
times 9 is negative 36,

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:12.950
plus 8 is equal to negative 28.

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:15.690
And that's exactly what
we see here in this table.

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:18.170
So we don't even have
to look any further.

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:22.120
Choice 3 satisfies
the conditions

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.640
that when x is any
one of these things,

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:28.270
the corresponding y that's
defined by this equation

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:31.360
is going to be when x
is 4, y is negative 8.

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:35.760
When x is 7, y is negative
20, so on and so forth.
