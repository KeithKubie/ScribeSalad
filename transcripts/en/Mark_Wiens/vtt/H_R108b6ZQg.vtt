00:00:00.204 --> 00:00:02.593
- Hey everyone, it's Mark
Wiens with eatingthaifood.com

00:00:02.593 --> 00:00:04.459
in Bangkok, Thailand.

00:00:04.459 --> 00:00:06.507
Right now in Thailand it is mango season,

00:00:06.507 --> 00:00:09.280
and o if you go to the market,
or even on the streets,

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:12.106
you will find all sorts
of different varieties

00:00:12.106 --> 00:00:14.539
and ripenesses of mangoes.

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:17.813
During mango season,
also, you'll notice a lot

00:00:17.813 --> 00:00:19.930
of food carts and restaurants,

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:21.491
and even in the markets as well,

00:00:21.491 --> 00:00:25.907
serving khao neeo mamuang,
which is mango sticky rice.

00:00:25.907 --> 00:00:28.108
I think it's probably one
of the most well known

00:00:28.108 --> 00:00:30.059
Thai desserts throughout the entire world,

00:00:30.059 --> 00:00:33.138
and it's very popular in Thailand as well.

00:00:33.138 --> 00:00:35.506
We are gonna make the recipe right now,

00:00:35.506 --> 00:00:37.804
for mango sticky rice.

00:00:37.804 --> 00:00:39.139
♫ Shine like gold.

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:42.556
(upbeat energetic music)

00:00:46.245 --> 00:00:47.861
♫ Shine like gold.
The first thing we're gonna do

00:00:47.861 --> 00:00:49.727
is get started with the sticky rice,

00:00:49.727 --> 00:00:51.703
and in Thai it's called kow neuw.

00:00:51.703 --> 00:00:54.893
It is Thai sticky glutinous rice,

00:00:54.893 --> 00:00:56.551
and I've already been soaking this rice

00:00:56.551 --> 00:00:59.421
for about six hours, but what you do

00:00:59.421 --> 00:01:02.026
is when you first get the sticky
rice it's gonna be almost,

00:01:02.026 --> 00:01:03.935
it's gonna be white in color and have

00:01:03.935 --> 00:01:05.482
a little bit of starch around it,

00:01:05.482 --> 00:01:07.502
and you wanna remove all of that starch,

00:01:07.502 --> 00:01:09.954
so what you do is you grab
a handful of the rice,

00:01:09.954 --> 00:01:12.907
and sort of just brush
it together with your,

00:01:12.907 --> 00:01:15.443
or rub it together with
your hands like that,

00:01:15.443 --> 00:01:18.842
and that's gonna remove
the starch in the water,

00:01:18.842 --> 00:01:22.339
and then after that, I rinsed,
I dumped out the water,

00:01:22.339 --> 00:01:26.602
and re-added more water five or six times,

00:01:26.602 --> 00:01:30.559
and then after that you soak
the rice for about six hours,

00:01:30.559 --> 00:01:32.621
and so now we are left with this.

00:01:32.621 --> 00:01:36.076
You can see the rice,
the starch on the grains

00:01:36.076 --> 00:01:37.692
are pretty much removed,

00:01:37.692 --> 00:01:39.852
and this will be perfect for steaming.

00:01:39.852 --> 00:01:41.175
In order to steam the sticky rice

00:01:41.175 --> 00:01:43.906
I'm gonna be using this
basket, and what I'm gonna do

00:01:43.906 --> 00:01:46.943
is just put the rice into
this very fine mesh cloth

00:01:46.943 --> 00:01:49.590
then put it into the basket,
and then steam it like that.

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.694
But if you don't have a basket,

00:01:51.694 --> 00:01:53.644
you could just use a mesh cloth like this,

00:01:53.644 --> 00:01:55.679
put all the rice into the middle of it,

00:01:55.679 --> 00:01:59.914
kinda wrap it up, and you can
use whatever steaming method

00:01:59.914 --> 00:02:02.324
you can find, or even come up with.

00:02:02.324 --> 00:02:05.863
Grab a big handful of rice
right out of the water,

00:02:05.863 --> 00:02:08.008
let it drip and drain
just for a couple seconds

00:02:08.008 --> 00:02:10.377
and then put it directly into the cloth.

00:02:10.377 --> 00:02:13.794
(energetic upbeat music)

00:02:18.059 --> 00:02:19.358
♫ Shine like gold.

00:02:19.358 --> 00:02:22.397
I'm gonna turn on my stove.

00:02:22.397 --> 00:02:26.577
(energetic upbeat music)

00:02:26.577 --> 00:02:29.494
♫ Shine like gold.

00:02:30.965 --> 00:02:33.821
And I have already added
some water into the bottom

00:02:33.821 --> 00:02:36.691
of the pot here, so there's
some water down there.

00:02:36.691 --> 00:02:39.101
It's gonna boil, and then
steam the sticky rice

00:02:39.101 --> 00:02:40.216
in the basket.

00:02:40.216 --> 00:02:41.883
Fold over the cloth,

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:45.962
like that,

00:02:45.962 --> 00:02:49.571
and then I'm gonna add
on a cover to seal in

00:02:49.571 --> 00:02:51.326
all of that steam.

00:02:51.326 --> 00:02:55.338
And this is gonna steam for
right about 12 to 15 minutes.

00:02:55.338 --> 00:02:57.974
And then we should have nice fluffy rice

00:02:57.974 --> 00:03:00.159
for our mango sticky rice.

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:03.642
It's been 12 minutes since
the water started boiling,

00:03:03.642 --> 00:03:05.642
let's check on the rice.

00:03:06.707 --> 00:03:09.034
Oh yeah, that's very steamy and hot,

00:03:09.034 --> 00:03:12.736
definitely be careful when you do this.

00:03:12.736 --> 00:03:13.595
Oh yeah that's hot.

00:03:13.595 --> 00:03:15.253
You can take just a fork or a spoon

00:03:15.253 --> 00:03:17.496
and just kinda check the,

00:03:17.496 --> 00:03:19.154
oh yeah that's almost perfect I think.

00:03:19.154 --> 00:03:21.021
You can see the texture of that rice,

00:03:21.021 --> 00:03:23.055
it looks cooked but,

00:03:23.055 --> 00:03:25.330
and you can almost, it
turns from kinda white

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:27.874
to kind of transparent.

00:03:27.874 --> 00:03:29.699
I think we are just about ready.

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:31.148
I think I'll cook it for,

00:03:31.148 --> 00:03:33.893
steam it for just a few more minutes,

00:03:33.893 --> 00:03:35.843
and then it will be ready.

00:03:35.843 --> 00:03:38.260
Put back the cloth, cover on,

00:03:39.493 --> 00:03:41.486
and just in like two more minutes,

00:03:41.486 --> 00:03:43.144
and our sticky rice will be ready.

00:03:43.144 --> 00:03:45.894
I'm gonna take off the entire pot

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:50.937
and move it over to a table to sit,

00:03:51.921 --> 00:03:53.453
and I'm not even gonna turn off the stove

00:03:53.453 --> 00:03:56.365
but then put on a small
pot right over the fire,

00:03:56.365 --> 00:03:58.525
and we're gonna cook the coconut milk,

00:03:58.525 --> 00:04:00.182
and actually this is coconut cream,

00:04:00.182 --> 00:04:02.049
in Thai this is called hua gati.

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:03.281
So this is just, you wanna just use

00:04:03.281 --> 00:04:06.577
the thickest, richest coconut cream.

00:04:06.577 --> 00:04:08.695
This is freshly squeezed.

00:04:08.695 --> 00:04:13.432
Pour it in very carefully, oh
man, look at the consistency

00:04:13.432 --> 00:04:16.915
of that, that is almost
approaching the consistency

00:04:16.915 --> 00:04:18.998
of yogurt, it's so thick.

00:04:19.854 --> 00:04:21.512
Alright.

00:04:21.512 --> 00:04:23.588
And you want a low heat on this as well.

00:04:23.588 --> 00:04:25.413
And immediately as you
add the coconut milk in,

00:04:25.413 --> 00:04:26.862
we're gonna go with sugar.

00:04:26.862 --> 00:04:29.612
About three pretty big spoonfuls.

00:04:30.638 --> 00:04:31.471
One.

00:04:38.983 --> 00:04:40.085
Alright.

00:04:40.085 --> 00:04:42.585
And then delicately stir that,

00:04:44.369 --> 00:04:47.155
make sure you just stir in one direction

00:04:47.155 --> 00:04:49.969
in a circular motion, very smoothly

00:04:49.969 --> 00:04:51.418
and rhythmically because you don't want

00:04:51.418 --> 00:04:53.751
that coconut milk to curdle.

00:04:54.734 --> 00:04:57.561
Got about a teaspoon of salt.

00:04:57.561 --> 00:04:59.178
Pour that all in.

00:04:59.178 --> 00:05:01.572
And this is gonna just
bring out the flavor

00:05:01.572 --> 00:05:06.559
of that coconut milk and
contrast that sugar as well.

00:05:06.559 --> 00:05:08.928
You wanna keep on
stirring this very gently

00:05:08.928 --> 00:05:11.129
until it comes to a
boil, and then make sure

00:05:11.129 --> 00:05:14.083
all of the sugar is dissolved
and then turn off the heat.

00:05:14.083 --> 00:05:16.500
I'm gonna taste it real fast.

00:05:18.975 --> 00:05:19.808
Mmmm!

00:05:20.984 --> 00:05:25.004
Oh yeah, that is sweet
and a little bit salty,

00:05:25.004 --> 00:05:28.069
and really creamy coconuty.

00:05:28.069 --> 00:05:31.594
It is boiling right now,
I'm gonna turn the fire off.

00:05:31.594 --> 00:05:33.126
And at this point you
gotta work pretty fast

00:05:33.126 --> 00:05:34.826
because you don't want the sticky rice,

00:05:34.826 --> 00:05:37.431
or the coconut milk, coconut cream,

00:05:37.431 --> 00:05:39.590
to cool off before you combine them.

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:41.625
So back to the sticky rice,

00:05:41.625 --> 00:05:45.065
I'm gonna take this
entire basket, pour it,

00:05:45.065 --> 00:05:48.982
or dump the entire sticky
rice into a big bowl,

00:05:50.882 --> 00:05:53.166
oh and that should just
come off very nicely.

00:05:53.166 --> 00:05:54.072
(laughing)

00:05:54.072 --> 00:05:56.440
Oh yeah, there we go, a
little pyramid of sticky rice.

00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:01.094
Then you grab spoon, kinda
fluff this rice a little bit,

00:06:01.094 --> 00:06:03.671
oh, perfect sticky rice.

00:06:03.671 --> 00:06:04.869
And then quickly move back over

00:06:04.869 --> 00:06:07.140
to the coconut cream, sugar mixture.

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:08.645
You don't wanna dump in the whole thing,

00:06:08.645 --> 00:06:10.930
you wanna just go spoon by spoon.

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:15.233
Maybe a couple of spoons at
first, and then you wanna

00:06:15.233 --> 00:06:17.650
just very delicately stir it.

00:06:18.772 --> 00:06:22.189
(upbeat energetic music)

00:06:25.808 --> 00:06:28.369
The reason you wanna just add
a couple spoons and then stir,

00:06:28.369 --> 00:06:30.131
and then add a couple
more spoons and then stir

00:06:30.131 --> 00:06:32.918
is because you don't want
the rice to be too wet.

00:06:32.918 --> 00:06:35.969
You want it to be sticky, but not wet.

00:06:35.969 --> 00:06:38.546
And then additionally
though, the coconut cream

00:06:38.546 --> 00:06:42.713
is going to start to seep into
the grains of sticky rice.

00:06:44.063 --> 00:06:45.972
We have reached the end
of the coconut milk,

00:06:45.972 --> 00:06:47.889
just a little bit left.

00:06:49.051 --> 00:06:50.542
I'm gonna finish it off.

00:06:50.542 --> 00:06:55.362
So we ended up putting all
of it, just little by little.

00:06:55.362 --> 00:06:57.689
And the texture of this
sticky rice has gone

00:06:57.689 --> 00:07:01.924
from individual grains to
almost pudding in texture

00:07:01.924 --> 00:07:03.958
because of that thick coconut cream.

00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:05.218
Wow, that looks amazing.

00:07:05.218 --> 00:07:07.392
And what they do at
the market in Thailand,

00:07:07.392 --> 00:07:11.559
is they pile it into a cone
shape so that it's beautiful

00:07:12.574 --> 00:07:15.709
and it looks really good, and
then they serve it like that

00:07:15.709 --> 00:07:17.409
in individual portions.

00:07:17.409 --> 00:07:20.321
I'm gonna try to do it, I don't
know how well this will go,

00:07:20.321 --> 00:07:23.023
but let's see how it turns out.

00:07:23.023 --> 00:07:27.705
My cone formation, smooth it
down, it almost looks like

00:07:27.705 --> 00:07:29.627
there's, it's just filled with butter,

00:07:29.627 --> 00:07:32.581
but that is just all coconut cream.

00:07:32.581 --> 00:07:33.779
Oh, look at that.

00:07:33.779 --> 00:07:35.410
Just glistening.

00:07:35.410 --> 00:07:36.635
(laughing)

00:07:36.635 --> 00:07:38.017
Wonderful.

00:07:38.017 --> 00:07:41.121
I know you're gonna
wanna eat it immediately,

00:07:41.121 --> 00:07:43.559
so you can grab a little taste.

00:07:43.559 --> 00:07:44.813
But before we actually,

00:07:44.813 --> 00:07:46.387
oh that's good!

00:07:46.387 --> 00:07:48.672
But before we actually
assemble it together

00:07:48.672 --> 00:07:52.490
with the mango, we're gonna
really quickly dry-fry up

00:07:52.490 --> 00:07:55.151
some yellow mung beans.

00:07:55.151 --> 00:07:56.822
Pour this all into the wok,

00:07:56.822 --> 00:07:59.424
and these are commonly sprinkled on top

00:07:59.424 --> 00:08:02.270
of mango sticky rice in Thailand.

00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:05.251
They're just in a dry pot, pan or wok.

00:08:05.251 --> 00:08:07.369
Just lightly toast these for a few minutes

00:08:07.369 --> 00:08:09.536
to give them a crispiness.

00:08:13.025 --> 00:08:16.202
You can see the beans are
slightly getting toasted,

00:08:16.202 --> 00:08:17.205
I think that's good to go,

00:08:17.205 --> 00:08:19.072
let me turn off the fire.

00:08:19.072 --> 00:08:21.064
Put them back into this little bowl.

00:08:21.064 --> 00:08:23.564
It almost smells like popcorn.

00:08:24.798 --> 00:08:25.631
Okay.

00:08:26.623 --> 00:08:27.793
And we have one more thing to do,

00:08:27.793 --> 00:08:29.980
I actually almost forgot to do it,

00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:33.143
because I was so excited to
assemble the mango sticky rice,

00:08:33.143 --> 00:08:34.676
but we've gotta boil

00:08:34.676 --> 00:08:38.033
a little more coconut cream to go on top.

00:08:38.033 --> 00:08:39.700
Turn on low heat,

00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:44.245
and you can immediately
pour in coconut cream.

00:08:44.245 --> 00:08:48.412
A little bit of salt, and
then keep stirring that up,

00:08:49.996 --> 00:08:52.336
and this is just gonna be
salt and coconut cream,

00:08:52.336 --> 00:08:53.785
no sugar in this.

00:08:53.785 --> 00:08:56.237
That has thickened up and it is boiling,

00:08:56.237 --> 00:08:59.233
I'm gonna turn it off and
we'll immediately pour it

00:08:59.233 --> 00:09:00.733
into a small bowl.

00:09:03.259 --> 00:09:07.426
Oh yeah, this is gonna be
the gravy on top, alright.

00:09:08.999 --> 00:09:12.872
And if you wanna get really
Thai, you have to get

00:09:12.872 --> 00:09:16.606
a little plastic bag, this
is just a packaging bag,

00:09:16.606 --> 00:09:21.175
and they make a little, kinda
wrap it up like this I think,

00:09:21.175 --> 00:09:23.405
and they make a little mitt.

00:09:23.405 --> 00:09:24.240
A little mitt.

00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:27.305
Actually they inside it
out I think, inside it out,

00:09:27.305 --> 00:09:30.663
and make a little mitten of a plastic bag

00:09:30.663 --> 00:09:32.168
to be able to scoop out the rice,

00:09:32.168 --> 00:09:34.202
otherwise your hand
will get really sticky,

00:09:34.202 --> 00:09:35.846
and it will just get messy.

00:09:35.846 --> 00:09:38.423
Alright, first I'm just
gonna mix up the rice

00:09:38.423 --> 00:09:40.206
and actually we can get rid of the spoon,

00:09:40.206 --> 00:09:44.289
now that I have the plastic
mitt method goin' on.

00:09:45.570 --> 00:09:47.646
Oh, that feels wonderful,

00:09:47.646 --> 00:09:51.547
it's so oily and buttery
from that coconut cream.

00:09:51.547 --> 00:09:54.125
I'm gonna move that
over to the side there.

00:09:54.125 --> 00:09:56.869
Oh man, that is so smooth and,

00:09:56.869 --> 00:10:00.101
okay, and then you dish out,
I'm gonna dish out a portion,

00:10:00.101 --> 00:10:02.267
I'm guessing that this amount that we made

00:10:02.267 --> 00:10:05.221
would probably make about, at least 10,

00:10:05.221 --> 00:10:08.132
maybe you could even get
like 15 portions out of this.

00:10:08.132 --> 00:10:09.498
Maybe about that much.

00:10:09.498 --> 00:10:12.911
Move this onto the plate
and I think I'm just,

00:10:12.911 --> 00:10:13.789
there are a lot of different ways

00:10:13.789 --> 00:10:15.321
that you could present this,

00:10:15.321 --> 00:10:19.612
but I think I'm gonna make
a base, add a little more,

00:10:19.612 --> 00:10:23.742
and then just put the
mango right on top of it.

00:10:23.742 --> 00:10:27.462
Kinda fluff it up a little bit, alright,

00:10:27.462 --> 00:10:29.642
that's pretty good, let's
move on to the mango.

00:10:29.642 --> 00:10:32.679
Take it off, leave it in the sticky rice.

00:10:32.679 --> 00:10:34.650
Let's just quickly talk about mangoes.

00:10:34.650 --> 00:10:37.247
In Thailand, there are many many, well,

00:10:37.247 --> 00:10:39.190
across the world there are
many different varieties

00:10:39.190 --> 00:10:41.750
of mangoes, and the one
that is commonly used

00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:45.727
for mango sticky rice is
called ma-muang nam dok mai,

00:10:45.727 --> 00:10:48.388
and it's a very sweet, and very smooth,

00:10:48.388 --> 00:10:51.467
it's not stringy, and
just a little bit tart.

00:10:51.467 --> 00:10:54.491
But really, you can use any type of mango

00:10:54.491 --> 00:10:58.658
that is sweet and yellow, and
it should work fine for this.

00:11:00.826 --> 00:11:02.828
And, but the key thing in Thailand,

00:11:02.828 --> 00:11:05.475
they always wanna use beautiful mangoes

00:11:05.475 --> 00:11:07.175
for mango sticky rice.

00:11:07.175 --> 00:11:10.842
I'm gonna very delicately
slice off the skin

00:11:12.455 --> 00:11:17.108
and I'm not the best at
this, but I will do my best.

00:11:17.108 --> 00:11:19.937
That is a very good looking mango.

00:11:19.937 --> 00:11:21.260
Very ripe.

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:23.127
And then, I think we're ready here,

00:11:23.127 --> 00:11:25.941
the seed should be right in the middle,

00:11:25.941 --> 00:11:29.173
and then the next step is to kinda,

00:11:29.173 --> 00:11:31.743
put your knife in and find the seed.

00:11:31.743 --> 00:11:33.743
Slice right on the seed,

00:11:34.850 --> 00:11:38.876
and then you're gonna have
whole like, mango steak.

00:11:38.876 --> 00:11:41.370
Alright, I think we're good.

00:11:41.370 --> 00:11:43.822
Alright, slice that, make sure it doesn't

00:11:43.822 --> 00:11:45.800
slide out of your hand.

00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:48.503
Look at that juice coming out.

00:11:48.503 --> 00:11:52.864
And then what you do is you
slice the mango like that

00:11:52.864 --> 00:11:54.197
into big slices,

00:11:56.730 --> 00:11:58.221
like that,

00:11:58.221 --> 00:12:00.499
and just kinda slide it

00:12:00.499 --> 00:12:03.249
directly onto the rice like that.

00:12:04.692 --> 00:12:07.107
Oh man, that looks amazing.

00:12:07.107 --> 00:12:10.107
Turn the mango over, and same thing.

00:12:11.552 --> 00:12:12.385
Skin it.

00:12:14.881 --> 00:12:17.542
And then once the other side
of the mango is skinned,

00:12:17.542 --> 00:12:20.705
you do the exact same thing.

00:12:20.705 --> 00:12:23.872
Cut around the seed, and then put that

00:12:26.473 --> 00:12:28.758
right down on the sticky rice.

00:12:28.758 --> 00:12:32.450
That is a lot of mango, the way I like it.

00:12:32.450 --> 00:12:34.367
Oh, that is full plate.

00:12:35.473 --> 00:12:38.134
Then the crispy mung
beans, sprinkle this on,

00:12:38.134 --> 00:12:42.217
and you wanna mostly get
it onto the sticky rice.

00:12:43.707 --> 00:12:46.033
Alright. I think that's good.

00:12:46.033 --> 00:12:47.440
The moment has come!

00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:49.962
It is time to eat the mango sticky rice.

00:12:49.962 --> 00:12:53.668
I'm gonna add on just a little
bit of that coconut cream,

00:12:53.668 --> 00:12:55.485
I'm going right in for the middle there,

00:12:55.485 --> 00:12:58.068
on to that mango in the middle,

00:12:59.487 --> 00:13:00.703
and

00:13:00.703 --> 00:13:01.784
oh man,

00:13:01.784 --> 00:13:03.191
that's just like butter.

00:13:03.191 --> 00:13:06.340
The spoon just goes right
through that mango, look at that.

00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:09.280
Get, with a little bit of
those crispy mung beans,

00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:12.461
a ratio of the sticky
rice, that's perfect.

00:13:12.461 --> 00:13:15.878
(upbeat energetic music)

00:13:18.061 --> 00:13:21.099
The mango is so smooth,
it's not stringy at all,

00:13:21.099 --> 00:13:24.763
and it's just completely
sweet and really juicy.

00:13:24.763 --> 00:13:27.911
To contrast that, is the
sticky rice which is,

00:13:27.911 --> 00:13:30.029
you can still taste each individual grain,

00:13:30.029 --> 00:13:34.196
but the rice is so rich and
oily from that coconut cream.

00:13:35.797 --> 00:13:39.214
(upbeat energetic music)

00:13:42.079 --> 00:13:45.912
The mango just, like,
liquefies in your mouth.

00:13:47.086 --> 00:13:48.786
It's so juicy.

00:13:48.786 --> 00:13:53.607
Oh, it almost tastes like
it's just gushing with honey.

00:13:53.607 --> 00:13:54.440
Wow.

00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:55.836
That's it for this recipe.

00:13:55.836 --> 00:13:57.786
I think that you'll not
only enjoy eating it,

00:13:57.786 --> 00:14:00.447
but also making it is quite a lot of fun,

00:14:00.447 --> 00:14:03.150
and just imagine showing up at a party,

00:14:03.150 --> 00:14:05.393
or at a get together or a dinner,

00:14:05.393 --> 00:14:07.385
with this pan full of sticky rice,

00:14:07.385 --> 00:14:10.074
and then putting on the plastic bag glove

00:14:10.074 --> 00:14:12.401
to put it on to peoples plates

00:14:12.401 --> 00:14:15.926
and then slicing fresh
mango, fresh juicy mango,

00:14:15.926 --> 00:14:17.667
right over the top of that.

00:14:17.667 --> 00:14:20.453
I think your friends love you for it.

00:14:20.453 --> 00:14:22.627
