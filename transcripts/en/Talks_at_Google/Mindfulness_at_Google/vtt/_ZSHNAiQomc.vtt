[SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:49.820
[SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:24.580
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:27.260
INTERPRETER: So
regardless of topic,

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.117
let's just engage in a dialogue.

00:03:29.117 --> 00:03:30.450
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:31.408
INTERPRETER: It's good?

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:44.201
MALE SPEAKER:
Afternoon, my friends.

00:03:44.201 --> 00:03:48.030
Pomnyun Sunim is
no ordinary monk.

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.440
He's the winner of
the Magsaysay Award,

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:53.140
which is Asia's
Nobel Peace Prize.

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:55.600
He was one of the
very first people

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:59.590
to organize food aid for
North Korea back in the 1990s.

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:02.480
Yeah, back when
even I was young.

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:04.830
His deep engagement
with North Koreans

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:09.380
have made him one of the world's
top experts on North Korea.

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:14.700
He is a popular zen teacher
and he's a widely respected

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:17.519
international
humanitarian leader.

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:21.769
Venerable Pomnyun
Sunim is the chairman

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:23.970
of the Peace
Foundation in Seoul,

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:28.740
which supports policy
research and analysis aimed

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:34.070
at Korean unification--
peaceful unification--

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:37.250
and humanitarian
issues in North Korea.

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:42.040
He is also a Zen master with
the Seoul-based Jungto Society,

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:46.990
which he originally established
in 1988 to facilitate self

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:49.560
improvement through
volunteerism.

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:52.112
And overall, he's
just a cool dude.

00:04:52.112 --> 00:04:54.570
And my friends, please welcome
the Venerable Pomnyun Sunim.

00:04:59.579 --> 00:05:01.420
Sunim, thank you so
much for being here.

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:04.870
We're so honored to have you.

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:06.287
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:05:06.287 --> 00:05:08.495
INTERPRETER: Thank you for
inviting me to this event.

00:05:08.495 --> 00:05:10.270
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:12.417
INTERPRETER: And it's
great to see you all today.

00:05:12.417 --> 00:05:13.750
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:15.460
INTERPRETER: You
must be all busy.

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:17.502
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:05:17.502 --> 00:05:19.710
INTERPRETER: So is it OK
for you to be here and waste

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:20.543
your time like this?

00:05:20.543 --> 00:05:22.230
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:25.990
MALE SPEAKER: They
get paid to sit here.

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:27.377
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:05:27.377 --> 00:05:29.335
INTERPRETER: So they
don't have to do anything.

00:05:29.335 --> 00:05:30.200
You still pay them?

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:30.550
MALE SPEAKER: Yes.

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:32.234
Well, I get paid
to sit with you.

00:05:32.234 --> 00:05:35.900
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:39.259
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:05:39.259 --> 00:05:41.050
INTERPRETER: So I think
I need to thank you

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:42.720
all first here at Google.

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:45.610
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:48.080
INTERPRETER: Because of you,
I derive a lot of benefits.

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:50.450
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:52.450
INTERPRETER: I travel
all over the world.

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:54.112
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:05:54.112 --> 00:05:56.570
INTERPRETER: So I especially
travel to those areas that are

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:57.780
less travelled.

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:02.345
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:06:02.345 --> 00:06:05.090
INTERPRETER: Because you allow
a free use of the Google Maps,

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:06.720
I tend to use it very often.

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:07.820
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:09.153
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:06:09.153 --> 00:06:10.250
INTERPRETER: Thank you.

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:11.710
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:13.850
INTERPRETER: But there is
also not so good things.

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:17.670
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:19.170
INTERPRETER: Because
I travel often,

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:21.450
I should know my way
around fairly well.

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:23.610
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:25.860
INTERPRETER: So I should
know every nooks and crannies

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:26.590
in Seoul.

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:33.850
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:37.190
INTERPRETER: So if I were
to quit from being a monk,

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:39.810
I would have been made
an excellent taxi driver.

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:41.911
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:06:41.911 --> 00:06:44.160
INTERPRETER: But right now,
my talents are now wasted.

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:45.820
It's useless anymore.

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:50.639
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:06:50.639 --> 00:06:52.180
INTERPRETER: Because
the GPS actually

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:56.087
knows the roads a
lot better than I do.

00:06:56.087 --> 00:06:57.420
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:06:57.420 --> 00:06:59.797
INTERPRETER: So another
matter to thank you about--

00:06:59.797 --> 00:07:01.130
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:02.330
INTERPRETER: --is YouTube.

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:12.540
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:15.770
INTERPRETER: So my dialogues,
engagement with folks,

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:18.020
the video clips of those
are on the YouTube.

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:20.050
And that allows
Koreans communities

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:24.000
across the world to be able
to speak with me vicariously.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.740
And that made it easy for
me to engage with them.

00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:33.272
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:07:33.272 --> 00:07:34.730
INTERPRETER: Before,
our engagement

00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:38.560
was limited by time and space
and limited to areas like this,

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:39.390
spaces like this.

00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:44.450
But now our engagement has been
freed from that limitation.

00:07:44.450 --> 00:07:45.920
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:47.637
INTERPRETER: And
this is also free.

00:07:47.637 --> 00:07:48.970
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:52.720
INTERPRETER: So thank
you doubly for that.

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:54.860
MALE SPEAKER: So Sunim,
I am aware that you're

00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:56.590
on a world tour.

00:07:56.590 --> 00:08:00.850
You are touring, you're
giving 115 lectures

00:08:00.850 --> 00:08:05.060
in 115 cities in 115 days.

00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:09.580
And Mountain View is
lecture number 79.

00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:12.320
And tonight you're
going to Oakland,

00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:15.530
and they'll be lecture 80.

00:08:15.530 --> 00:08:17.590
Young people like
him, lots of energy.

00:08:17.590 --> 00:08:20.560
Not old people like me.

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:24.090
So, my dear friend, your
world tour-- what do you

00:08:24.090 --> 00:08:25.800
hope to achieve in doing this?

00:08:29.295 --> 00:08:31.240
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:35.159
INTERPRETER: There's no specific
thing I'm trying to achieve.

00:08:35.159 --> 00:08:37.480
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:40.127
INTERPRETER: So a lot of people
suffer in their everyday lives.

00:08:40.127 --> 00:08:41.460
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:42.419
INTERPRETER: To listen to them--

00:08:42.419 --> 00:08:43.679
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:08:43.679 --> 00:08:45.304
INTERPRETER: --and
to engage with them.

00:08:45.304 --> 00:08:50.710
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:08:50.710 --> 00:08:52.260
INTERPRETER: And
I feel fulfilled

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:54.690
when I see their
suffering alleviated even

00:08:54.690 --> 00:08:56.140
by a small amount.

00:08:56.140 --> 00:08:58.770
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:08:58.770 --> 00:09:01.210
INTERPRETER: Because they
see me first through YouTube.

00:09:01.210 --> 00:09:02.544
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:09:02.544 --> 00:09:04.751
INTERPRETER: And they want
to engage with me directly

00:09:04.751 --> 00:09:05.427
in person.

00:09:05.427 --> 00:09:06.760
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:10.040
INTERPRETER: And they also
want to ask questions of me.

00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:11.775
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:09:11.775 --> 00:09:13.150
INTERPRETER: So
I have been asked

00:09:13.150 --> 00:09:15.320
to come visit them many times.

00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:18.190
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:09:18.190 --> 00:09:19.940
INTERPRETER: But seeing
how Buddhist monks

00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:24.750
should be fairly not
busy, but I'm always busy.

00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:29.461
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:09:29.461 --> 00:09:31.210
INTERPRETER: So I
didn't have time before,

00:09:31.210 --> 00:09:32.840
but this time I
actually made time

00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:35.330
in order to travel through
the world and meet with them.

00:09:35.330 --> 00:09:43.560
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:45.630
INTERPRETER: Second,
because I only speak Korean,

00:09:45.630 --> 00:09:48.800
until now I was able to
engage with Koreans only.

00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:56.677
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:09:56.677 --> 00:09:58.260
INTERPRETER: So if
I were to be reborn

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:00.000
in the next lifetime
speaking English,

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.060
then I'll be able to engage
with English speakers

00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:03.640
and other global
citizens, as well.

00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:06.660
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:09.960
INTERPRETER: So I'm actually
practicing for my next lifetime

00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:11.420
by doing this world tour.

00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:12.240
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:14.031
INTERPRETER: So it's
an investment, per se.

00:10:16.639 --> 00:10:18.930
MALE SPEAKER: You do recognize
when you get reborn, you

00:10:18.930 --> 00:10:20.600
sort of forget some English?

00:10:25.730 --> 00:10:27.271
He's going, oops.

00:10:27.271 --> 00:10:30.990
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:30.990 --> 00:10:32.486
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:10:32.486 --> 00:10:34.860
INTERPRETER: So no one has
proved that yet, so we'll see.

00:10:37.637 --> 00:10:39.220
MALE SPEAKER: So you
will get a chance

00:10:39.220 --> 00:10:40.940
to ask Sunim some questions.

00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:42.270
We will leave plenty of time.

00:10:42.270 --> 00:10:45.921
So I only have a few
questions, and then we'll

00:10:45.921 --> 00:10:46.920
give you plenty of time.

00:10:49.510 --> 00:10:52.565
So Sunim, I have to ask
you about North Korea

00:10:52.565 --> 00:10:54.440
because you're one of
the world's top experts

00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:55.740
on the topic.

00:10:55.740 --> 00:10:58.790
And I'm just going to ask you
a very broad question, which

00:10:58.790 --> 00:11:02.880
is, talk about peace
and humanitarian issues

00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:04.620
in North Korea today.

00:11:10.816 --> 00:11:19.250
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:11:19.250 --> 00:11:21.550
INTERPRETER: So when you
say North Korea, images

00:11:21.550 --> 00:11:26.750
of dictatorship, nuclear,
and human rights violations.

00:11:26.750 --> 00:11:28.590
Those are the images
that come to your mind.

00:11:28.590 --> 00:11:32.729
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:11:32.729 --> 00:11:35.270
INTERPRETER: But we don't often
think that there are actually

00:11:35.270 --> 00:11:38.647
20 million people living there.

00:11:38.647 --> 00:11:39.980
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:42.130
INTERPRETER: And they are
suffering as we speak.

00:11:42.130 --> 00:11:43.463
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:11:43.463 --> 00:11:44.810
INTERPRETER: They lack food.

00:11:44.810 --> 00:11:46.157
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:11:46.157 --> 00:11:47.490
INTERPRETER: They lack medicine.

00:11:47.490 --> 00:11:48.900
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:50.250
INTERPRETER: They lack water.

00:11:50.250 --> 00:11:51.930
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:11:51.930 --> 00:11:53.930
INTERPRETER: They lack a
lot of essential goods.

00:11:53.930 --> 00:11:55.080
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:56.250
INTERPRETER: They
don't have electricity.

00:11:56.250 --> 00:11:57.760
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:11:57.760 --> 00:11:59.301
INTERPRETER: They
don't have anything

00:11:59.301 --> 00:12:01.160
to burn for heat during winter.

00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:10.134
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:12:10.134 --> 00:12:11.550
INTERPRETER: Because
we only focus

00:12:11.550 --> 00:12:15.240
on the bad actions
perpetrated by the leadership,

00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:18.350
we forget about the 20 million
people who suffer under them.

00:12:18.350 --> 00:12:24.490
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:12:24.490 --> 00:12:28.080
INTERPRETER: So I want to focus
on the 20 million people who

00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:31.090
are suffering and think
about their suffering.

00:12:31.090 --> 00:12:35.244
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:12:35.244 --> 00:12:36.910
INTERPRETER: Because
they have the right

00:12:36.910 --> 00:12:39.590
to ask for help as
part of the human race.

00:12:39.590 --> 00:12:41.470
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:12:41.470 --> 00:12:43.950
INTERPRETER: And that's
what I seek to do.

00:12:43.950 --> 00:12:48.476
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:12:48.476 --> 00:12:50.850
INTERPRETER: So many of them,
some of them actually cross

00:12:50.850 --> 00:12:53.877
the river into China because
they cannot suffer anymore.

00:12:53.877 --> 00:12:55.210
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:12:55.210 --> 00:12:56.668
INTERPRETER: And
they are refugees.

00:12:56.668 --> 00:12:59.644
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:12:59.644 --> 00:13:01.435
INTERPRETER: Of course
China considers them

00:13:01.435 --> 00:13:03.770
as illegal aliens
and repatriates them

00:13:03.770 --> 00:13:05.530
to North Korea.

00:13:05.530 --> 00:13:07.382
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:13:07.382 --> 00:13:09.340
INTERPRETER: So it's a
little dangerous for you

00:13:09.340 --> 00:13:12.600
to actually actively help
North Korean refugees in China.

00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:15.160
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:17.760
INTERPRETER: But they also
have the right to be protected.

00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:20.360
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:24.120
INTERPRETER: And so that's why
I give them support when I can.

00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:25.810
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:13:25.810 --> 00:13:28.590
INTERPRETER: And human rights
is also very bad in North Korea.

00:13:28.590 --> 00:13:31.810
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:13:31.810 --> 00:13:33.310
INTERPRETER: But
it's very difficult

00:13:33.310 --> 00:13:36.880
to find a way to
alleviate, improve

00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:39.160
that situation in North Korea.

00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:42.020
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:13:42.020 --> 00:13:45.800
INTERPRETER: But we do have
consistent and constant

00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:47.400
awareness.

00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:50.820
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:52.430
INTERPRETER: And
collect information

00:13:52.430 --> 00:13:54.850
about the sufferings and let
the international community

00:13:54.850 --> 00:13:55.890
know about them.

00:13:55.890 --> 00:13:57.314
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:13:57.314 --> 00:13:58.980
INTERPRETER: Because
they have the right

00:13:58.980 --> 00:14:01.680
to live as human beings.

00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:08.970
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:14:08.970 --> 00:14:11.660
INTERPRETER: Not to criticize
the North Korean regime,

00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:13.890
but to give North Korean
people the opportunity

00:14:13.890 --> 00:14:17.330
to live as human beings.

00:14:17.330 --> 00:14:18.950
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:14:18.950 --> 00:14:20.760
INTERPRETER: But this
is not an easy work.

00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:23.580
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:14:23.580 --> 00:14:25.080
INTERPRETER: Because
currently there

00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:28.600
is a great tension between
North and South Korea.

00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:32.390
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:14:32.390 --> 00:14:34.230
INTERPRETER: So North
Korea is the enemy

00:14:34.230 --> 00:14:35.890
from South Korean perspective.

00:14:35.890 --> 00:14:40.720
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:44.000
INTERPRETER: So we ignore
the people's plight,

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.060
their diseases,
their lack of food.

00:14:46.060 --> 00:14:48.460
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:14:48.460 --> 00:14:49.960
INTERPRETER: And
since North Korea's

00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:53.120
also at odds with
the United States.

00:14:53.120 --> 00:15:01.210
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:15:01.210 --> 00:15:02.870
INTERPRETER: So
from my perspective,

00:15:02.870 --> 00:15:05.510
the US is not really
keeping in principle

00:15:05.510 --> 00:15:07.830
to their humanitarian
principles when

00:15:07.830 --> 00:15:09.975
it comes to dealing
with North Korea.

00:15:09.975 --> 00:15:19.087
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:15:19.087 --> 00:15:20.920
INTERPRETER: So
improvements in human rights

00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:23.090
situation and
humanitarian aid, I think,

00:15:23.090 --> 00:15:26.310
can only really be improved
once the tension surrounding

00:15:26.310 --> 00:15:28.770
the Korean peninsula
can be relaxed a little.

00:15:28.770 --> 00:15:33.341
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:15:33.341 --> 00:15:34.840
INTERPRETER: So no
matter how feeble

00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:36.820
it might be, I do
my best in order

00:15:36.820 --> 00:15:39.960
to aid to the cause of peace
on the Korean peninsula.

00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:41.340
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:43.390
INTERPRETER: To go to peace.

00:15:43.390 --> 00:15:46.394
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:15:46.394 --> 00:15:48.810
INTERPRETER: The first step
in the road to peace is first,

00:15:48.810 --> 00:15:52.250
you have to acknowledge the
difference between you and me.

00:15:52.250 --> 00:15:56.890
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:15:56.890 --> 00:15:58.640
INTERPRETER: And second,
try to understand

00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:02.780
that the other might act
that way for a reason.

00:16:02.780 --> 00:16:05.240
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:07.540
INTERPRETER: But today,
just because others do not

00:16:07.540 --> 00:16:08.835
think the way we do--

00:16:08.835 --> 00:16:13.339
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:16:13.339 --> 00:16:15.505
INTERPRETER: --we actually
paint them into a corner,

00:16:15.505 --> 00:16:19.260
saying label them as
beast, as Satan, as evil.

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:22.696
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:16:22.696 --> 00:16:24.320
INTERPRETER: But if
you listen to them,

00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:28.490
they also think similarly about
South Korea and the United

00:16:28.490 --> 00:16:29.530
States.

00:16:29.530 --> 00:16:31.770
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:16:31.770 --> 00:16:34.450
INTERPRETER: That's why it's
difficult, the road to peace.

00:16:34.450 --> 00:16:41.095
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:16:41.095 --> 00:16:42.470
INTERPRETER: That's
well first we

00:16:42.470 --> 00:16:46.280
have to lay the foundation
of mutual understanding

00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:48.760
and acknowledgement of
each other's differences

00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:50.740
in order to arrive
at lasting peace.

00:16:50.740 --> 00:16:52.980
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:16:52.980 --> 00:16:56.220
INTERPRETER: But that path is
strewn with misunderstandings.

00:16:56.220 --> 00:17:02.200
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:03.700
INTERPRETER: So if
you claim that we

00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:06.609
need to acknowledge
our differences,

00:17:06.609 --> 00:17:09.079
understand their
point of view, people

00:17:09.079 --> 00:17:10.780
say you are trying
to sympathize.

00:17:10.780 --> 00:17:13.089
You are trying to
take their side.

00:17:13.089 --> 00:17:16.285
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:17:16.285 --> 00:17:17.910
INTERPRETER: So I
try to do what's best

00:17:17.910 --> 00:17:20.119
and what's good to
me in my thoughts,

00:17:20.119 --> 00:17:23.460
but I get criticized
from both sides.

00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:25.160
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:27.796
INTERPRETER: So perhaps that's
why I live such a long life.

00:17:27.796 --> 00:17:30.824
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:30.824 --> 00:17:33.240
MALE SPEAKER: So Sunim, are
you hopeful about world peace?

00:17:38.210 --> 00:17:39.727
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:17:39.727 --> 00:17:41.810
INTERPRETER: I think it's
going to take some time.

00:17:41.810 --> 00:17:45.490
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:17:45.490 --> 00:17:48.300
INTERPRETER: Because
even just a century ago--

00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:51.820
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:17:51.820 --> 00:17:55.040
INTERPRETER: So we usually
lived our lives in the community

00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:56.120
that we are born in.

00:17:56.120 --> 00:17:57.200
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:17:57.200 --> 00:17:58.600
INTERPRETER: With
the same ethnicity.

00:17:58.600 --> 00:17:59.190
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:17:59.190 --> 00:18:00.240
INTERPRETER: With
the same religion.

00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:01.160
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:02.618
INTERPRETER: With
the same culture.

00:18:02.618 --> 00:18:05.185
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:18:05.185 --> 00:18:06.810
INTERPRETER: So that
led us to thinking

00:18:06.810 --> 00:18:08.707
that we are always right.

00:18:08.707 --> 00:18:10.040
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:12.390
INTERPRETER: But now
we are all intermixed.

00:18:12.390 --> 00:18:14.220
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:18:14.220 --> 00:18:16.330
INTERPRETER: And you
have that tension.

00:18:16.330 --> 00:18:19.702
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:18:19.702 --> 00:18:21.410
INTERPRETER: So it
takes some time for us

00:18:21.410 --> 00:18:23.990
to develop the capacity
to understand each other,

00:18:23.990 --> 00:18:25.740
acknowledge each
other's differences.

00:18:25.740 --> 00:18:27.640
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:29.710
INTERPRETER: I think
we are improving.

00:18:29.710 --> 00:18:31.280
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:33.340
INTERPRETER: So after
a century or so--

00:18:33.340 --> 00:18:40.590
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:18:40.590 --> 00:18:43.710
INTERPRETER: --I believe that
we can live together in harmony

00:18:43.710 --> 00:18:47.200
on the basis of acknowledgment
of each other's differences

00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:49.320
and understanding
of the differences.

00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:51.532
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:18:51.532 --> 00:18:52.990
INTERPRETER: It's
not anything else

00:18:52.990 --> 00:18:54.790
that becomes a
source of conflict.

00:18:54.790 --> 00:18:59.645
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:18:59.645 --> 00:19:01.520
INTERPRETER: So the
differences will actually

00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:04.440
be appreciated for bringing
about enrichment to our lives,

00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:06.390
rather than being a
source of conflict.

00:19:06.390 --> 00:19:09.574
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:19:09.574 --> 00:19:10.990
INTERPRETER: So
for example, there

00:19:10.990 --> 00:19:13.627
are different flowers
within the same pot.

00:19:13.627 --> 00:19:14.960
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:16.240
INTERPRETER: Different shapes.

00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:17.020
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:19:17.020 --> 00:19:17.850
INTERPRETER: Different colors.

00:19:17.850 --> 00:19:18.760
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:19.968
INTERPRETER: Different sizes.

00:19:19.968 --> 00:19:22.570
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:19:22.570 --> 00:19:25.320
INTERPRETER: But see, they
come together to create beauty.

00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:27.740
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:19:27.740 --> 00:19:31.804
INTERPRETER: So that's the
world that I'm dreaming about.

00:19:31.804 --> 00:19:33.220
MALE SPEAKER: So
is there anything

00:19:33.220 --> 00:19:37.280
that Googlers and Google can
help you or help world peace?

00:19:41.280 --> 00:20:01.843
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:20:01.843 --> 00:20:05.080
INTERPRETER: So it's important
for Google, as a corporation,

00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:10.030
to abide by its fiduciaries to
pursue profit at the same time.

00:20:10.030 --> 00:20:13.150
For example, allowing all of
us to use Google Maps for free.

00:20:13.150 --> 00:20:16.910
If you could allow us a lot
of spaces, a lot of areas,

00:20:16.910 --> 00:20:20.950
a lot of functions that we
could also use in common,

00:20:20.950 --> 00:20:22.860
I think that's a
great contribution.

00:20:22.860 --> 00:20:24.282
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:20:24.282 --> 00:20:26.448
INTERPRETER: Does that mean
that you won't get paid?

00:20:26.448 --> 00:20:28.540
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:28.540 --> 00:20:36.817
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:20:36.817 --> 00:20:38.650
INTERPRETER: So there's
a traditional saying

00:20:38.650 --> 00:20:41.130
that if you create a
lot of good blessings,

00:20:41.130 --> 00:20:43.190
then you will get the
blessings in return.

00:20:43.190 --> 00:20:45.650
I think you are actually
investing a lot of blessing

00:20:45.650 --> 00:20:48.531
for your own fortune
in the future.

00:20:48.531 --> 00:20:50.530
MALE SPEAKER: Now, don't
be shy to ask any time.

00:20:54.110 --> 00:20:56.670
I have one more question
before I open the floor.

00:20:56.670 --> 00:20:58.600
So this time I'm going
to shift the focus

00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:00.150
to something more local.

00:21:03.030 --> 00:21:06.680
Which is, so the
problem with modern life

00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:09.320
in a modern society, especially
in the Silicon Valley,

00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:13.180
is that people feel
overwhelmed all the time.

00:21:13.180 --> 00:21:15.755
So do you have
any advice for how

00:21:15.755 --> 00:21:18.130
to address the feeling of
being overwhelmed all the time?

00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:26.771
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:21:26.771 --> 00:21:28.270
INTERPRETER: I'm
not sure, actually.

00:21:28.270 --> 00:21:31.422
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:31.422 --> 00:21:32.755
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:21:32.755 --> 00:21:37.200
INTERPRETER: Because everything
is becoming faster and faster.

00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:39.720
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:42.950
INTERPRETER: So there's a
saying in Buddhist sacred text.

00:21:42.950 --> 00:21:45.410
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:21:45.410 --> 00:21:48.000
INTERPRETER: Say for example,
a rabbit was taking a nap,

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.430
then it was alerted, woke up.

00:21:50.430 --> 00:21:51.764
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:21:51.764 --> 00:21:53.929
INTERPRETER: It almost felt
like the sky was falling

00:21:53.929 --> 00:21:55.090
and the earth was shaking.

00:21:55.090 --> 00:21:56.580
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:21:56.580 --> 00:21:58.079
INTERPRETER: And
it started running.

00:21:58.079 --> 00:21:59.710
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:21:59.710 --> 00:22:01.943
INTERPRETER: So
on the [INAUDIBLE]

00:22:01.943 --> 00:22:05.720
a deer was asking the rabbit,
where are you running?

00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:07.720
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:10.447
INTERPRETER: And the rabbit
said, the sky's falling.

00:22:10.447 --> 00:22:11.780
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:22:11.780 --> 00:22:13.400
INTERPRETER: And the
deer asked, really?

00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:14.620
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:22:14.620 --> 00:22:16.661
INTERPRETER: And so the
deer followed the rabbit.

00:22:16.661 --> 00:22:18.089
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:22:18.089 --> 00:22:20.630
INTERPRETER: So you know, the
deer wasn't convinced at first,

00:22:20.630 --> 00:22:22.120
but he started
following the rabbit.

00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:23.453
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:22:23.453 --> 00:22:24.710
INTERPRETER: And other deers.

00:22:24.710 --> 00:22:26.194
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:22:26.194 --> 00:22:28.110
INTERPRETER: So all the
animals in the forest,

00:22:28.110 --> 00:22:30.900
you know, they actually competed
each other, raced each other.

00:22:30.900 --> 00:22:33.180
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:22:33.180 --> 00:22:35.230
INTERPRETER: One might
be ahead of each other,

00:22:35.230 --> 00:22:36.630
but they traded places.

00:22:36.630 --> 00:22:38.177
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:22:38.177 --> 00:22:39.760
INTERPRETER: Because
everybody thought

00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:42.051
they needed to run away as
soon as possible, as quickly

00:22:42.051 --> 00:22:43.230
as possible to live.

00:22:43.230 --> 00:22:48.030
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:22:48.030 --> 00:22:50.370
INTERPRETER: But a tall
cliff was waiting for them

00:22:50.370 --> 00:22:51.787
at the edge of the forest.

00:22:51.787 --> 00:22:53.120
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:56.252
INTERPRETER: No one knew about
the existence of the cliff.

00:22:56.252 --> 00:23:02.709
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:23:02.709 --> 00:23:05.250
INTERPRETER: So they say, a lion
is watching this from above,

00:23:05.250 --> 00:23:07.560
and roared.

00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:09.812
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:23:09.812 --> 00:23:11.770
INTERPRETER: So all the
animals were frightened

00:23:11.770 --> 00:23:14.890
and they stopped.

00:23:14.890 --> 00:23:16.450
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:23:16.450 --> 00:23:18.700
INTERPRETER: So he asked the
cow, where are you going?

00:23:18.700 --> 00:23:19.240
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:20.720
INTERPRETER: And the
cow said, I don't know.

00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:21.740
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:23:21.740 --> 00:23:22.480
INTERPRETER: Why
were you running?

00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:23.420
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:23:23.420 --> 00:23:25.250
INTERPRETER: Because
the horse was running.

00:23:25.250 --> 00:23:26.610
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:23:26.610 --> 00:23:27.900
INTERPRETER: To the horse,
why are you running?

00:23:27.900 --> 00:23:28.860
He said he didn't know, either.

00:23:28.860 --> 00:23:29.480
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:30.410
INTERPRETER: Why
were you running?

00:23:30.410 --> 00:23:31.350
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:23:31.350 --> 00:23:32.720
INTERPRETER: Because
the sheep was running.

00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:33.900
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:23:33.900 --> 00:23:35.570
INTERPRETER: So he
asked all the animals.

00:23:35.570 --> 00:23:36.590
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:23:36.590 --> 00:23:38.400
INTERPRETER: He found the
original runner, the rabbit.

00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:39.190
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:23:39.190 --> 00:23:41.565
INTERPRETER: He said, why did
you run in the first place?

00:23:41.565 --> 00:23:44.814
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:23:44.814 --> 00:23:46.730
INTERPRETER: Because I
saw the sky was falling

00:23:46.730 --> 00:23:47.560
and the Earth shaking.

00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:48.890
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:23:48.890 --> 00:23:50.220
INTERPRETER: He said,
did you really see it?

00:23:50.220 --> 00:23:51.270
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:23:51.270 --> 00:23:53.260
INTERPRETER: So let's go back to
that place where you saw this.

00:23:53.260 --> 00:23:54.730
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:23:54.730 --> 00:23:56.313
INTERPRETER: They
go back to the place

00:23:56.313 --> 00:23:58.042
where the rabbit
was having a nap.

00:23:58.042 --> 00:24:00.010
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:24:00.010 --> 00:24:03.080
INTERPRETER: So he was
sleeping under an acorn tree.

00:24:03.080 --> 00:24:05.544
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:24:05.544 --> 00:24:07.460
INTERPRETER: So when an
acorn fell next to him

00:24:07.460 --> 00:24:10.050
while he was taking a nap,
that's what frightened him.

00:24:10.050 --> 00:24:11.530
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:24:11.530 --> 00:24:16.880
INTERPRETER: So they said this
was a happening, of sorts.

00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:18.780
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:24:18.780 --> 00:24:21.660
INTERPRETER: So perhaps that
explains where we are today.

00:24:21.660 --> 00:24:23.880
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:27.860
INTERPRETER: So we are always
racing, but where are we going?

00:24:27.860 --> 00:24:30.260
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:24:30.260 --> 00:24:33.740
INTERPRETER: So I want to ask
you back the same question.

00:24:33.740 --> 00:24:35.556
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:24:35.556 --> 00:24:37.180
INTERPRETER: The
reason for you to run.

00:24:37.180 --> 00:24:38.800
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:40.720
INTERPRETER: Is it because
of the money you get paid?

00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:41.960
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:24:41.960 --> 00:24:43.418
INTERPRETER: Is it
because you have

00:24:43.418 --> 00:24:44.775
to contribute to growing Google?

00:24:44.775 --> 00:24:46.870
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:24:46.870 --> 00:24:47.970
INTERPRETER: Is it really?

00:24:47.970 --> 00:24:50.670
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:24:50.670 --> 00:24:52.510
INTERPRETER: Why do you
have to run so fast?

00:24:52.510 --> 00:24:53.843
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:24:53.843 --> 00:24:57.487
INTERPRETER: I think it's time
for us to kind of review that.

00:24:57.487 --> 00:24:58.820
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:24:58.820 --> 00:25:00.070
INTERPRETER: And to
tell you this first--

00:25:00.070 --> 00:25:01.190
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:25:01.190 --> 00:25:02.440
INTERPRETER: And one more--

00:25:05.500 --> 00:25:08.130
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:25:08.130 --> 00:25:10.930
INTERPRETER: It is greed that
actually leads to anxiety.

00:25:10.930 --> 00:25:13.204
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:25:13.204 --> 00:25:15.120
INTERPRETER: Just because
you want to run fast

00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:17.700
doesn't necessarily
mean you run fast.

00:25:17.700 --> 00:25:19.370
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:25:19.370 --> 00:25:21.227
INTERPRETER: But we
always want to run fast.

00:25:21.227 --> 00:25:22.560
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:25:22.560 --> 00:25:24.880
INTERPRETER: But our
bodies do not agree.

00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:26.780
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:25:26.780 --> 00:25:28.670
INTERPRETER: That's why
it's so tough on us.

00:25:28.670 --> 00:25:30.216
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:25:30.216 --> 00:25:32.090
INTERPRETER: That's why
it's important for us

00:25:32.090 --> 00:25:34.290
to kind of stabilize our mind.

00:25:34.290 --> 00:25:36.336
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:25:36.336 --> 00:25:37.710
INTERPRETER:
Instead of being too

00:25:37.710 --> 00:25:40.170
obsessed over
wanting to run fast.

00:25:40.170 --> 00:25:42.070
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:25:42.070 --> 00:25:44.340
INTERPRETER: And start
thinking, growing the capacity

00:25:44.340 --> 00:25:45.470
to run fast.

00:25:45.470 --> 00:25:47.820
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:25:47.820 --> 00:25:50.020
INTERPRETER: But you
know, in modern world,

00:25:50.020 --> 00:25:53.220
we usually want
to run fast first.

00:25:53.220 --> 00:25:54.810
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:25:54.810 --> 00:25:56.080
INTERPRETER: That's
why we feel anxious.

00:25:56.080 --> 00:25:56.980
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:25:56.980 --> 00:25:58.354
INTERPRETER: And
we feel nervous.

00:25:58.354 --> 00:26:01.890
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:26:01.890 --> 00:26:03.520
INTERPRETER: And we
always are worried

00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:05.061
that somebody else
is running faster.

00:26:05.061 --> 00:26:08.020
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:26:08.020 --> 00:26:09.750
INTERPRETER: And I
think type of anxiety

00:26:09.750 --> 00:26:12.650
we are fully capable
of overcoming.

00:26:12.650 --> 00:26:15.400
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:18.250
INTERPRETER: So I just wanted
to speak to you about that.

00:26:18.250 --> 00:26:20.940
MALE SPEAKER: So the moral of
the story is steel the mind

00:26:20.940 --> 00:26:22.861
and never trust
a talking rabbit.

00:26:22.861 --> 00:26:28.270
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:28.270 --> 00:26:30.160
OK, questions from the audience.

00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:32.844
There's on there.

00:26:32.844 --> 00:26:33.760
There's one over here.

00:26:38.430 --> 00:26:40.090
This lady.

00:26:40.090 --> 00:26:42.540
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:26:42.540 --> 00:26:44.740
One of my favorite
modern philosophers

00:26:44.740 --> 00:26:48.370
said that the three most
dangerous human addictions

00:26:48.370 --> 00:26:54.280
today are heroin, carbohydrates,
and a monthly salary.

00:26:54.280 --> 00:26:56.100
His name is Nassim Taleb.

00:26:56.100 --> 00:26:58.080
He's Doctor Doom.

00:26:58.080 --> 00:27:02.250
So my question to you is most
of us here have at least two

00:27:02.250 --> 00:27:07.560
out of those three addictions,
definitely the monthly salary.

00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:09.840
And every day I ask
myself the question

00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:12.640
of what is the
purpose of humans?

00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:15.530
So as a human, what
should be a noble purpose

00:27:15.530 --> 00:27:16.340
that should pursue?

00:27:21.580 --> 00:27:23.140
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:27:23.140 --> 00:27:26.530
INTERPRETER: Do we
need to have a purpose?

00:27:26.530 --> 00:27:29.724
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:27:29.724 --> 00:27:31.140
INTERPRETER: Do
you think that you

00:27:31.140 --> 00:27:33.030
need a purpose in your life?

00:27:33.030 --> 00:27:34.660
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:27:34.660 --> 00:27:37.160
INTERPRETER: Does a
squirrel have a purpose?

00:27:37.160 --> 00:27:39.000
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:40.570
INTERPRETER: Do
deers in the hills,

00:27:40.570 --> 00:27:42.207
do they have a purpose
in their lives?

00:27:42.207 --> 00:27:43.540
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:27:43.540 --> 00:27:45.890
INTERPRETER: They just live.

00:27:45.890 --> 00:27:47.620
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:27:47.620 --> 00:27:50.420
INTERPRETER: So human beings
are not that different.

00:27:50.420 --> 00:27:52.570
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:27:52.570 --> 00:27:54.650
INTERPRETER: So meanings,
or sense of purpose,

00:27:54.650 --> 00:27:57.710
is an artifact
created by our mind.

00:27:57.710 --> 00:28:00.295
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:28:00.295 --> 00:28:02.670
INTERPRETER: So basically you
create the sense of purpose

00:28:02.670 --> 00:28:05.000
that you created,
and then you are

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:07.280
imprisoned by the
sense of purpose.

00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:08.662
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:28:08.662 --> 00:28:10.370
INTERPRETER: So you
need to actually gain

00:28:10.370 --> 00:28:13.340
an insight into that.

00:28:13.340 --> 00:28:15.940
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:28:15.940 --> 00:28:19.920
INTERPRETER: So you have to be
able to look into your mind.

00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:21.384
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:28:21.384 --> 00:28:23.300
INTERPRETER: Because
even though you might not

00:28:23.300 --> 00:28:24.787
have a specific purpose--

00:28:24.787 --> 00:28:26.120
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:28:26.120 --> 00:28:28.140
INTERPRETER: --if you just
start living out your days--

00:28:28.140 --> 00:28:29.473
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:28:29.473 --> 00:28:31.120
INTERPRETER: --while
you are living--

00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:32.453
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:28:32.453 --> 00:28:34.077
INTERPRETER: --how do you live?

00:28:34.077 --> 00:28:35.410
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:28:35.410 --> 00:28:36.950
INTERPRETER: If you
observe people--

00:28:36.950 --> 00:28:38.420
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:28:38.420 --> 00:28:40.990
INTERPRETER: They live in
the midst of suffering.

00:28:40.990 --> 00:28:43.140
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:28:43.140 --> 00:28:45.760
INTERPRETER: They live in the
midst of anxiety, nervousness.

00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:47.105
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:28:47.105 --> 00:28:49.030
INTERPRETER: They
live under stress.

00:28:49.030 --> 00:28:51.119
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:28:51.119 --> 00:28:52.660
INTERPRETER: But
then there are those

00:28:52.660 --> 00:28:55.910
who actually live freer and
happier than the rest of us.

00:28:55.910 --> 00:28:57.527
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:28:57.527 --> 00:28:59.360
INTERPRETER: So a lot
of people think this--

00:28:59.360 --> 00:29:01.090
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:29:01.090 --> 00:29:02.965
INTERPRETER: That if
you have a lot of money,

00:29:02.965 --> 00:29:04.147
you'll be freer and happier.

00:29:04.147 --> 00:29:05.480
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:29:05.480 --> 00:29:07.340
INTERPRETER: If you
have a high status,

00:29:07.340 --> 00:29:10.207
you'll be more free and happier.

00:29:10.207 --> 00:29:11.540
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:29:11.540 --> 00:29:13.123
INTERPRETER: It
almost looks that way.

00:29:13.123 --> 00:29:16.260
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:29:16.260 --> 00:29:18.460
INTERPRETER: But then is
people with a lot of money

00:29:18.460 --> 00:29:21.280
and high position, are they
really freer and happier?

00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:23.845
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:29:23.845 --> 00:29:25.970
INTERPRETER: So I don't
know how many people you've

00:29:25.970 --> 00:29:27.580
encountered in your life so far.

00:29:27.580 --> 00:29:29.087
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:29:29.087 --> 00:29:31.170
INTERPRETER: But I have
met a lot of those people.

00:29:31.170 --> 00:29:32.280
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:29:32.280 --> 00:29:33.930
INTERPRETER: But they
don't seem so happy.

00:29:33.930 --> 00:29:34.720
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:36.261
INTERPRETER: They
don't seem so free.

00:29:36.261 --> 00:29:37.620
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:29:37.620 --> 00:29:41.450
INTERPRETER: In a way, they
are even more chased by things.

00:29:41.450 --> 00:29:44.784
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:29:44.784 --> 00:29:46.700
INTERPRETER: So what do
we have to do in order

00:29:46.700 --> 00:29:50.855
to be more authentically
happy and free?

00:29:50.855 --> 00:29:54.350
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:29:54.350 --> 00:29:56.680
INTERPRETER: So the
answers to those questions

00:29:56.680 --> 00:29:58.270
we can always explore.

00:29:58.270 --> 00:30:00.580
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:30:00.580 --> 00:30:02.830
INTERPRETER: So if you look
at how our minds operate--

00:30:05.897 --> 00:30:07.230
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:30:07.230 --> 00:30:09.250
INTERPRETER: For example--

00:30:09.250 --> 00:30:10.634
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:30:10.634 --> 00:30:12.175
INTERPRETER: --say
this is the stage.

00:30:12.175 --> 00:30:13.810
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:30:13.810 --> 00:30:16.390
INTERPRETER: Say this is a
discotheque, a night club.

00:30:16.390 --> 00:30:20.000
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:22.500
INTERPRETER: For example, you
have the dancers, the audience

00:30:22.500 --> 00:30:27.140
of people who paid $100 a person
to come and dance in this club.

00:30:27.140 --> 00:30:30.675
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:30:30.675 --> 00:30:32.300
INTERPRETER: Then
there are the dancers

00:30:32.300 --> 00:30:35.740
that the club hires at $1,000
a night to actually dance

00:30:35.740 --> 00:30:37.530
on the stage.

00:30:37.530 --> 00:30:39.070
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:30:39.070 --> 00:30:42.130
INTERPRETER: So they all
dance to the same music.

00:30:42.130 --> 00:30:45.190
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:30:45.190 --> 00:30:47.960
INTERPRETER: But the people
who paid $100 to dance, they're

00:30:47.960 --> 00:30:49.070
having fun.

00:30:49.070 --> 00:30:51.450
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:30:51.450 --> 00:30:54.920
INTERPRETER: But the dancers
on the stage, they're working.

00:30:54.920 --> 00:30:56.580
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:30:56.580 --> 00:30:59.520
INTERPRETER: So the people below
stage are enjoying themselves.

00:30:59.520 --> 00:31:01.120
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:03.070
INTERPRETER: So if you
say extended club hours

00:31:03.070 --> 00:31:04.225
by 30 minutes--

00:31:04.225 --> 00:31:05.854
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:31:05.854 --> 00:31:08.020
INTERPRETER: --the people
below stage, they love it.

00:31:08.020 --> 00:31:11.680
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:15.120
INTERPRETER: The dancers on
the stage, they want overtime.

00:31:15.120 --> 00:31:16.546
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:31:16.546 --> 00:31:17.920
INTERPRETER: Why
such phenomenon?

00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:18.740
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:31:18.740 --> 00:31:20.800
INTERPRETER: They're doing
the same exact things.

00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:21.990
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:31:21.990 --> 00:31:24.031
INTERPRETER: So why is it
that people below stage

00:31:24.031 --> 00:31:25.010
are having fun?

00:31:25.010 --> 00:31:26.350
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:31:26.350 --> 00:31:28.055
INTERPRETER: And why is it
that the dancers on the stage

00:31:28.055 --> 00:31:28.720
are working?

00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:30.590
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:31:30.590 --> 00:31:32.660
INTERPRETER: So the only
difference is money.

00:31:32.660 --> 00:31:34.320
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:36.250
INTERPRETER: So if
you pay, you have fun.

00:31:36.250 --> 00:31:38.040
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:41.980
INTERPRETER: If you take
money, then you're working.

00:31:41.980 --> 00:31:43.440
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:45.398
INTERPRETER: So you're
all getting paid, right?

00:31:45.398 --> 00:31:47.638
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:47.638 --> 00:31:51.200
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:52.950
INTERPRETER: So that's
why you're working.

00:31:52.950 --> 00:31:54.810
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:31:54.810 --> 00:31:55.990
INTERPRETER: Because
I'm not getting paid.

00:31:55.990 --> 00:31:57.323
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:31:57.323 --> 00:31:59.880
INTERPRETER: I actually
have fun every single day.

00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:01.510
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:32:01.510 --> 00:32:04.210
INTERPRETER: That's
how your mind operates.

00:32:04.210 --> 00:32:08.450
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:32:08.450 --> 00:32:11.430
INTERPRETER: So being
free from labor--

00:32:11.430 --> 00:32:14.029
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:32:14.029 --> 00:32:15.570
INTERPRETER: So
being free from labor

00:32:15.570 --> 00:32:19.590
is not a matter of you getting
paid a lot for a short time.

00:32:19.590 --> 00:32:24.290
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:32:24.290 --> 00:32:27.200
INTERPRETER: It's for you
to enjoy, or make fun,

00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:28.926
out of your labor.

00:32:28.926 --> 00:32:30.472
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:32:30.472 --> 00:32:31.930
INTERPRETER: So
how do you do that?

00:32:31.930 --> 00:32:33.740
How do you transform
labor into fun?

00:32:33.740 --> 00:32:35.439
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:32:35.439 --> 00:32:36.980
INTERPRETER: That
means that you have

00:32:36.980 --> 00:32:40.320
to become the agent
of your own actions.

00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:44.360
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:47.000
INTERPRETER: So when
you pay money to dance,

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:49.520
the money is not the purpose.

00:32:49.520 --> 00:32:51.630
You having fun is the purpose.

00:32:51.630 --> 00:32:55.440
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:57.720
INTERPRETER: But if
you get paid to dance,

00:32:57.720 --> 00:33:00.020
then dancing is not the purpose.

00:33:00.020 --> 00:33:02.670
The money is the purpose.

00:33:02.670 --> 00:33:04.094
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:33:04.094 --> 00:33:05.760
INTERPRETER: So you
are actually selling

00:33:05.760 --> 00:33:08.555
your professional dancing
abilities for money.

00:33:08.555 --> 00:33:10.470
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:33:10.470 --> 00:33:13.547
INTERPRETER: Then you become
enslaved to that transaction.

00:33:13.547 --> 00:33:14.880
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:33:14.880 --> 00:33:16.640
INTERPRETER: That's
why it's tough.

00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:18.592
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:33:18.592 --> 00:33:20.550
INTERPRETER: So if you
look at those principles

00:33:20.550 --> 00:33:22.260
that move our minds--

00:33:22.260 --> 00:33:24.484
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:33:24.484 --> 00:33:26.650
INTERPRETER: --then you are
able to diagnose at what

00:33:26.650 --> 00:33:29.090
areas and what times
you feel happy.

00:33:29.090 --> 00:33:31.359
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:33:31.359 --> 00:33:32.900
INTERPRETER: We
usually think that we

00:33:32.900 --> 00:33:35.197
feel we are pleased
when we receive help--

00:33:35.197 --> 00:33:36.530
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:33:36.530 --> 00:33:37.905
INTERPRETER: --but
that's not so.

00:33:37.905 --> 00:33:40.224
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:33:40.224 --> 00:33:41.640
INTERPRETER: Because
that actually

00:33:41.640 --> 00:33:44.160
is a path to enslaving yourself.

00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:50.350
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:33:50.350 --> 00:33:52.100
INTERPRETER: So I
encourage you to examine

00:33:52.100 --> 00:33:54.340
how your mind operates--

00:33:54.340 --> 00:33:56.000
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:57.625
INTERPRETER: --so
that you can actually

00:33:57.625 --> 00:33:59.920
bring more enjoyment
or fun to your work.

00:33:59.920 --> 00:34:01.386
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:34:01.386 --> 00:34:03.010
INTERPRETER: And to
your life, as well.

00:34:03.010 --> 00:34:05.969
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:34:05.969 --> 00:34:07.760
INTERPRETER: It's not
important whether you

00:34:07.760 --> 00:34:10.010
die today or the next day.

00:34:10.010 --> 00:34:11.947
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:34:11.947 --> 00:34:14.280
INTERPRETER: Because you need
to be happy today in order

00:34:14.280 --> 00:34:16.056
to make your next
life happy, as well.

00:34:16.056 --> 00:34:17.389
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:34:17.389 --> 00:34:19.820
INTERPRETER: So no one can
prove that the next life exists

00:34:19.820 --> 00:34:22.302
or not, of course.

00:34:22.302 --> 00:34:25.364
MALE SPEAKER: If it exists,
you'll speak English.

00:34:25.364 --> 00:34:30.237
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:30.237 --> 00:34:31.570
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:34:31.570 --> 00:34:33.611
INTERPRETER: Do you have
any follow up questions?

00:34:35.480 --> 00:34:37.964
MALE SPEAKER: Sunim,
that's a beautiful answer.

00:34:37.964 --> 00:34:39.380
Oh by the way, I
do have an answer

00:34:39.380 --> 00:34:43.540
for that question, what
is the meaning of life.

00:34:43.540 --> 00:34:48.309
The meaning of life is not.

00:34:48.309 --> 00:34:49.774
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:49.774 --> 00:34:50.940
MALE SPEAKER: Next question.

00:34:58.730 --> 00:35:00.810
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:35:00.810 --> 00:35:05.440
I agree many of our sufferings
are really due to our mind.

00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:10.070
But this year seems-- this
year has been especially

00:35:10.070 --> 00:35:12.510
complicated or hard
to swallow for me.

00:35:12.510 --> 00:35:17.340
I mean, early this year starting
with the Ukraine crisis,

00:35:17.340 --> 00:35:20.000
and then the conflicts
in the Middle East.

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:23.220
We have this Ebola
outbreak and whatnot.

00:35:23.220 --> 00:35:25.790
I feel as if the
entire universe is

00:35:25.790 --> 00:35:29.630
kind of inching towards
the end, or so to speak.

00:35:29.630 --> 00:35:34.160
And we're closing to the
autumn of the universe.

00:35:34.160 --> 00:35:35.850
What's going on this year?

00:35:35.850 --> 00:35:37.510
Is this thing going to continue?

00:35:37.510 --> 00:35:40.520
What's your opinion?

00:35:40.520 --> 00:35:41.880
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:45.270
INTERPRETER: So these
problems always exist.

00:35:45.270 --> 00:35:47.040
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:35:47.040 --> 00:35:48.580
INTERPRETER: From
a long time ago.

00:35:48.580 --> 00:35:49.913
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:35:49.913 --> 00:35:51.950
INTERPRETER: And they
will always exist.

00:35:51.950 --> 00:35:53.720
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:35:53.720 --> 00:35:56.020
INTERPRETER: So the
world is not so complex.

00:35:56.020 --> 00:36:00.642
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:36:00.642 --> 00:36:02.350
INTERPRETER: So the
world becomes complex

00:36:02.350 --> 00:36:04.880
if you lack the capacity
to understand it.

00:36:04.880 --> 00:36:08.950
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:36:08.950 --> 00:36:11.850
INTERPRETER: The karmas by
which you understand the world--

00:36:11.850 --> 00:36:13.380
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:36:13.380 --> 00:36:14.940
INTERPRETER: --was
created a long time ago.

00:36:14.940 --> 00:36:16.050
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:36:16.050 --> 00:36:17.180
INTERPRETER: But the
world has changed.

00:36:17.180 --> 00:36:18.480
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:19.560
INTERPRETER: But
we are still trying

00:36:19.560 --> 00:36:21.856
to analyze the world through
that karmic paradigm.

00:36:21.856 --> 00:36:23.540
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:36:23.540 --> 00:36:24.820
INTERPRETER: That's why
it's very, very difficult

00:36:24.820 --> 00:36:26.500
for us to analyze
it, understand it.

00:36:26.500 --> 00:36:27.110
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:36:27.110 --> 00:36:28.520
INTERPRETER: That's why
it makes it complex.

00:36:28.520 --> 00:36:30.060
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:36:30.060 --> 00:36:31.650
INTERPRETER: So the
mistake I make--

00:36:31.650 --> 00:36:33.010
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:36:33.010 --> 00:36:35.880
INTERPRETER: --think that
the world itself is complex.

00:36:35.880 --> 00:36:38.154
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:36:38.154 --> 00:36:40.070
INTERPRETER: So that's
why you need a new lens

00:36:40.070 --> 00:36:42.320
by which to analyze the world.

00:36:42.320 --> 00:36:44.140
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:36:44.140 --> 00:36:46.150
INTERPRETER: So Ebola,
it's not a huge deal.

00:36:46.150 --> 00:36:47.900
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:36:47.900 --> 00:36:50.977
INTERPRETER: There's a lot
of fear involved in the US.

00:36:50.977 --> 00:36:52.310
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:36:52.310 --> 00:36:56.300
INTERPRETER: It is the
fear that's a huge deal.

00:36:56.300 --> 00:37:17.430
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:37:17.430 --> 00:37:18.910
INTERPRETER: So
even ISIS, that's

00:37:18.910 --> 00:37:22.020
the same kind of
reactionary methods

00:37:22.020 --> 00:37:25.560
that a weak, actually
a weak state,

00:37:25.560 --> 00:37:27.790
actually usually
expresses itself.

00:37:27.790 --> 00:37:29.454
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:37:29.454 --> 00:37:31.995
INTERPRETER: Because if you're
actually strong and confident,

00:37:31.995 --> 00:37:34.040
you don't engage in such terror.

00:37:34.040 --> 00:37:38.100
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:37:38.100 --> 00:37:40.730
INTERPRETER: It is a method
of expression usually reserved

00:37:40.730 --> 00:37:42.760
for the weak who are enraged.

00:37:42.760 --> 00:37:44.384
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:37:44.384 --> 00:37:46.050
INTERPRETER: So how
do you deal with it?

00:37:46.050 --> 00:37:48.704
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:37:48.704 --> 00:37:50.120
INTERPRETER: If
you actually speak

00:37:50.120 --> 00:37:54.130
to the source of their anger,
it becomes easy to deal with it.

00:37:54.130 --> 00:37:55.894
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:37:55.894 --> 00:37:57.810
INTERPRETER: But if you
try to suppress them--

00:37:57.810 --> 00:38:00.481
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:38:00.481 --> 00:38:02.355
INTERPRETER: --you might
be able to stop it--

00:38:02.355 --> 00:38:03.880
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:38:03.880 --> 00:38:05.866
INTERPRETER: --but
it will continue.

00:38:05.866 --> 00:38:10.982
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:38:10.982 --> 00:38:12.440
INTERPRETER: So
throughout history,

00:38:12.440 --> 00:38:13.564
you've seen that happening.

00:38:13.564 --> 00:38:15.530
Unless you manage to kill
off every single one,

00:38:15.530 --> 00:38:16.310
it'll continue.

00:38:16.310 --> 00:38:18.820
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:38:18.820 --> 00:38:20.520
INTERPRETER: But we
can't do that today.

00:38:20.520 --> 00:38:24.480
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:27.250
INTERPRETER: Because we
don't allow ourselves

00:38:27.250 --> 00:38:30.045
to kill others who
are bystanders.

00:38:30.045 --> 00:38:31.977
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:38:31.977 --> 00:38:33.810
INTERPRETER: That's why
we need a new method

00:38:33.810 --> 00:38:35.520
of dealing with such phenomena.

00:38:35.520 --> 00:38:37.284
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:38:37.284 --> 00:38:38.700
INTERPRETER: So
when nation states

00:38:38.700 --> 00:38:40.960
are in conflict
with each other--

00:38:40.960 --> 00:38:42.999
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:38:42.999 --> 00:38:44.790
INTERPRETER: --we can't
solve their problem

00:38:44.790 --> 00:38:46.020
with the same method.

00:38:46.020 --> 00:38:51.830
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:38:51.830 --> 00:38:54.360
INTERPRETER: So we need a new
way to approach such problems,

00:38:54.360 --> 00:38:59.500
but we are always attached
to methodologies of the past.

00:38:59.500 --> 00:39:03.090
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:39:03.090 --> 00:39:04.590
INTERPRETER: So
from my perspective,

00:39:04.590 --> 00:39:08.240
I think we lack an understanding
of the human psyche.

00:39:08.240 --> 00:39:09.610
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:39:09.610 --> 00:39:11.068
INTERPRETER: Why
they act that way.

00:39:11.068 --> 00:39:13.120
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:39:13.120 --> 00:39:15.140
INTERPRETER: It looks
ridiculous and horrible

00:39:15.140 --> 00:39:17.160
from our perspective.

00:39:17.160 --> 00:39:21.042
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:39:21.042 --> 00:39:22.750
INTERPRETER: So we
need to try to explore

00:39:22.750 --> 00:39:27.540
why they feel as if they have
to behave in such a manner.

00:39:27.540 --> 00:39:30.180
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:39:30.180 --> 00:39:32.375
INTERPRETER: So it's not
a huge problem, per se.

00:39:32.375 --> 00:39:33.830
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:39:33.830 --> 00:39:36.080
INTERPRETER: But it's a
problem that we need to solve.

00:39:36.080 --> 00:39:37.770
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:39:37.770 --> 00:39:40.510
INTERPRETER: Then we need
to explore solutions.

00:39:40.510 --> 00:39:43.260
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:39:43.260 --> 00:39:45.580
INTERPRETER: So if
the strong can't

00:39:45.580 --> 00:39:47.397
compromise with the weak--

00:39:47.397 --> 00:39:48.730
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:39:48.730 --> 00:39:51.690
INTERPRETER: --then that is
called embracing the weak.

00:39:51.690 --> 00:39:53.280
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:39:53.280 --> 00:39:55.407
INTERPRETER: And it's
spoken in a positive manner.

00:39:55.407 --> 00:39:56.740
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:39:56.740 --> 00:39:59.430
INTERPRETER: But if the
weak have to compromise--

00:39:59.430 --> 00:40:00.929
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:40:00.929 --> 00:40:02.970
INTERPRETER: --then they
say the weak capitulate.

00:40:02.970 --> 00:40:04.320
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:06.840
INTERPRETER: And that is
not a good sounding word.

00:40:06.840 --> 00:40:09.857
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:40:09.857 --> 00:40:12.190
INTERPRETER: That's why if
you force them to capitulate,

00:40:12.190 --> 00:40:14.660
they'll look for the next
opportunity to rebel.

00:40:14.660 --> 00:40:18.514
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:40:18.514 --> 00:40:20.180
INTERPRETER: So that
kind of methodology

00:40:20.180 --> 00:40:23.890
brings about a temporary lull,
but not a permanent peace.

00:40:23.890 --> 00:40:28.116
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:40:28.116 --> 00:40:30.490
INTERPRETER: That's why the
strong needs to do something.

00:40:34.240 --> 00:40:35.546
MALE SPEAKER: Thank you.

00:40:35.546 --> 00:40:36.965
There's a question here.

00:40:40.280 --> 00:40:42.750
AUDIENCE: I've heard that
in some Buddhist traditions,

00:40:42.750 --> 00:40:44.380
women are treated differently.

00:40:44.380 --> 00:40:47.720
For instance, I've heard that
in order to become a Buddha,

00:40:47.720 --> 00:40:50.600
a woman must first be
reincarnated as a man.

00:40:50.600 --> 00:40:51.960
What do you feel about this?

00:40:51.960 --> 00:40:52.860
What is your opinion?

00:40:52.860 --> 00:40:53.510
Do you agree?

00:40:53.510 --> 00:40:55.730
Do you think this is antiquated?

00:40:55.730 --> 00:40:56.340
I'm curious.

00:41:00.920 --> 00:41:03.530
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:41:03.530 --> 00:41:05.030
INTERPRETER: So
there's a difference

00:41:05.030 --> 00:41:09.720
between Buddhist
Dharma and Buddhism.

00:41:09.720 --> 00:41:11.754
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:41:11.754 --> 00:41:12.920
MALE SPEAKER: Define dharma.

00:41:12.920 --> 00:41:14.220
Dharma means teaching, right?

00:41:21.122 --> 00:41:27.095
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:41:27.095 --> 00:41:28.720
INTERPRETER: So when
I speak of dharma,

00:41:28.720 --> 00:41:32.200
it speaks to the teaching of
the truth as spoken by Buddha.

00:41:32.200 --> 00:41:36.970
When I say Buddhism, I speak
more of the cultural artifacts

00:41:36.970 --> 00:41:40.880
that surround the Buddhism.

00:41:40.880 --> 00:41:44.577
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:41:44.577 --> 00:41:46.160
INTERPRETER: So when
Buddha was alive,

00:41:46.160 --> 00:41:49.820
there was a great
discrimination based on gender,

00:41:49.820 --> 00:41:52.000
as well as based on the caste.

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:55.992
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:41:55.992 --> 00:41:58.450
INTERPRETER: But Buddha thought
that you can't discriminate

00:41:58.450 --> 00:42:00.640
between humans based
on their caste.

00:42:00.640 --> 00:42:05.420
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:42:05.420 --> 00:42:08.150
INTERPRETER: So when a person
wanted to become a monk,

00:42:08.150 --> 00:42:10.960
he received them
without restrictions.

00:42:10.960 --> 00:42:18.990
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:42:18.990 --> 00:42:22.140
INTERPRETER: So there were a
lot of members from the lowest

00:42:22.140 --> 00:42:25.500
caste among his sanga, his
original community of monks.

00:42:25.500 --> 00:42:29.069
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:42:29.069 --> 00:42:30.610
INTERPRETER: And he
taught that there

00:42:30.610 --> 00:42:32.600
are four types of
rivers in this world.

00:42:32.600 --> 00:42:34.370
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:42:34.370 --> 00:42:37.180
INTERPRETER: But they all become
one sea when they flow out.

00:42:37.180 --> 00:42:40.665
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:42:40.665 --> 00:42:43.040
INTERPRETER: So likewise,
there are four different castes

00:42:43.040 --> 00:42:43.820
in this world.

00:42:43.820 --> 00:42:46.110
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:42:46.110 --> 00:42:49.840
INTERPRETER: But within my
teachings, there's only one.

00:42:49.840 --> 00:42:55.425
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:42:55.425 --> 00:42:59.230
INTERPRETER: And he allowed
for women to become a convert.

00:42:59.230 --> 00:43:00.650
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:43:00.650 --> 00:43:02.525
INTERPRETER: And there
was a great opposition

00:43:02.525 --> 00:43:04.190
to that at that time.

00:43:04.190 --> 00:43:06.410
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:43:06.410 --> 00:43:08.190
INTERPRETER: Because
at that time,

00:43:08.190 --> 00:43:10.450
women were not considered
fully human beings.

00:43:10.450 --> 00:43:12.414
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:43:12.414 --> 00:43:13.830
INTERPRETER: Because
at that time,

00:43:13.830 --> 00:43:16.250
women were not considered
capable of becoming

00:43:16.250 --> 00:43:18.430
holy human beings by themselves.

00:43:18.430 --> 00:43:20.040
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:43:20.040 --> 00:43:22.720
INTERPRETER: Because they had
to be somebody's daughter when

00:43:22.720 --> 00:43:23.467
they were young.

00:43:23.467 --> 00:43:24.800
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:43:24.800 --> 00:43:27.012
INTERPRETER: And they
had to be somebody's wife

00:43:27.012 --> 00:43:27.970
when they were married.

00:43:27.970 --> 00:43:31.055
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:43:31.055 --> 00:43:32.680
INTERPRETER: And when
the husband died,

00:43:32.680 --> 00:43:35.440
they had to remain
as somebody's mother.

00:43:35.440 --> 00:43:37.600
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:43:37.600 --> 00:43:41.220
INTERPRETER: So they were
always labeled in attachment

00:43:41.220 --> 00:43:42.650
to some male.

00:43:42.650 --> 00:43:44.760
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:43:44.760 --> 00:43:47.430
INTERPRETER: But for a woman
to actually convert and enter

00:43:47.430 --> 00:43:48.420
into the community--

00:43:48.420 --> 00:43:51.047
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:43:51.047 --> 00:43:53.255
INTERPRETER: --then you are
allowing them, in effect,

00:43:53.255 --> 00:43:55.120
to own themselves.

00:43:55.120 --> 00:43:58.950
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:43:58.950 --> 00:44:01.470
INTERPRETER: And
acknowledging that they

00:44:01.470 --> 00:44:05.600
are one independent, self
sufficient human being.

00:44:05.600 --> 00:44:07.610
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:44:07.610 --> 00:44:12.170
INTERPRETER: And he allowed that
while he was alive in that era.

00:44:12.170 --> 00:44:14.140
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:44:14.140 --> 00:44:16.137
INTERPRETER: But
after 300, 400 years--

00:44:16.137 --> 00:44:17.470
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:44:17.470 --> 00:44:19.880
INTERPRETER: --that
practice disappeared.

00:44:19.880 --> 00:44:24.610
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:44:24.610 --> 00:44:26.760
INTERPRETER: And
Buddhism was dyed

00:44:26.760 --> 00:44:32.040
by the originals, India's
traditional ideologies.

00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:35.660
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:44:35.660 --> 00:44:38.310
INTERPRETER: So in the
original ideology of India,

00:44:38.310 --> 00:44:40.680
there are five things that
women can never become.

00:44:40.680 --> 00:44:42.950
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:44:42.950 --> 00:44:44.755
INTERPRETER: They can
never be a wise king.

00:44:44.755 --> 00:44:46.050
She can never be a wise king--

00:44:46.050 --> 00:44:46.850
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:44:46.850 --> 00:44:48.260
INTERPRETER: --could
never be a Buddha--

00:44:48.260 --> 00:44:49.490
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:44:49.490 --> 00:44:51.240
INTERPRETER: --could
never be [INAUDIBLE].

00:44:51.240 --> 00:44:57.784
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:44:57.784 --> 00:44:59.950
INTERPRETER: --cannot become
one of the kings of one

00:44:59.950 --> 00:45:00.700
of the heavens--

00:45:00.700 --> 00:45:01.900
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:45:01.900 --> 00:45:03.691
INTERPRETER: --and
cannot become a Brahmin.

00:45:03.691 --> 00:45:05.550
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:45:05.550 --> 00:45:08.090
INTERPRETER: And so that
traditional Indian belief

00:45:08.090 --> 00:45:10.000
system entered into Buddhism.

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:12.590
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:45:12.590 --> 00:45:15.020
INTERPRETER: And according
to that tradition,

00:45:15.020 --> 00:45:16.770
women cannot become a Buddha.

00:45:16.770 --> 00:45:18.910
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:45:18.910 --> 00:45:20.820
INTERPRETER: Then they
said, therefor women

00:45:20.820 --> 00:45:23.410
do not need to become a monk.

00:45:23.410 --> 00:45:25.120
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:45:25.120 --> 00:45:27.580
INTERPRETER: So just do a
good deeds in this lifetime--

00:45:27.580 --> 00:45:29.300
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:45:29.300 --> 00:45:31.180
INTERPRETER: --and
be reborn as a man.

00:45:31.180 --> 00:45:32.690
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:45:32.690 --> 00:45:34.550
INTERPRETER: And then try
to become a Buddha, then.

00:45:34.550 --> 00:45:35.950
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:45:35.950 --> 00:45:37.908
INTERPRETER: But that's
not Buddhist teachings.

00:45:37.908 --> 00:45:43.250
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:45:43.250 --> 00:45:46.140
INTERPRETER: But in the
historical evolution

00:45:46.140 --> 00:45:50.560
of Buddhism as an institution,
that actually has taken root.

00:45:50.560 --> 00:45:56.570
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:45:56.570 --> 00:45:59.170
INTERPRETER: And it is part
of the Theravada tradition

00:45:59.170 --> 00:46:03.200
of Buddhism, but it is not part
of Buddha's original teaching.

00:46:03.200 --> 00:46:04.852
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:46:04.852 --> 00:46:06.310
INTERPRETER: But
it is true that we

00:46:06.310 --> 00:46:09.150
have to recognize that in
today, in our current reality,

00:46:09.150 --> 00:46:11.620
there is discrimination
in Buddhism against women.

00:46:11.620 --> 00:46:15.200
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:46:15.200 --> 00:46:17.180
INTERPRETER: But
instead of labeling them

00:46:17.180 --> 00:46:19.600
as Buddhism is
actually a lingering

00:46:19.600 --> 00:46:23.190
artifact from a feudal
society that we lived in.

00:46:23.190 --> 00:46:25.900
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:46:25.900 --> 00:46:28.660
INTERPRETER: And it is Buddhism
that actually has accepted,

00:46:28.660 --> 00:46:30.850
been corrupted by
that tradition.

00:46:30.850 --> 00:46:34.760
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:46:34.760 --> 00:46:36.380
INTERPRETER: So
that discrimination,

00:46:36.380 --> 00:46:40.580
we can say it is part of a
Buddhist cultural tradition,

00:46:40.580 --> 00:46:43.165
but you can't say it is part
of Buddha's original Dharma

00:46:43.165 --> 00:46:43.665
teaching.

00:46:47.997 --> 00:46:49.330
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:46:49.330 --> 00:46:50.612
INTERPRETER: Do you have
any follow up questions?

00:46:50.612 --> 00:46:51.445
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:46:51.445 --> 00:46:52.402
That was amazing.

00:46:52.402 --> 00:46:53.943
MALE SPEAKER: You
know the Dalai Lama

00:46:53.943 --> 00:46:55.850
had a commentary
on that question?

00:46:55.850 --> 00:46:59.136
The Dalai Lama said,
he said his next life,

00:46:59.136 --> 00:47:00.510
he wants to be
reborn as a woman.

00:47:03.310 --> 00:47:04.940
So maybe there's a
suggestion for you.

00:47:04.940 --> 00:47:08.880
Maybe you can be
reborn as a woman, too.

00:47:08.880 --> 00:47:16.160
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:47:16.160 --> 00:47:19.430
INTERPRETER: So Buddha said
the difference between genders,

00:47:19.430 --> 00:47:23.090
label such as men and women, is
an illusion, is seeing things.

00:47:23.090 --> 00:47:25.100
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:47:25.100 --> 00:47:27.760
INTERPRETER: It is just a
preconception that you hold.

00:47:34.940 --> 00:47:40.730
AUDIENCE: I went to the trip
with [INAUDIBLE] over here

00:47:40.730 --> 00:47:45.320
in 2008 to China and North
Korea, border of North Korea.

00:47:45.320 --> 00:47:49.450
And climbing the
mountains of [INAUDIBLE]

00:47:49.450 --> 00:47:52.090
was very informative
and very nice.

00:47:52.090 --> 00:47:55.310
But the thing was that one
of the most memorable moments

00:47:55.310 --> 00:47:58.130
is when looking at the
North Korean border,

00:47:58.130 --> 00:47:59.560
all the trees were chopped off.

00:47:59.560 --> 00:48:00.559
Every single trees.

00:48:00.559 --> 00:48:02.100
There were no trees
in the mountains.

00:48:02.100 --> 00:48:07.980
And also seeing aid from
China getting rejected

00:48:07.980 --> 00:48:12.330
and coming back from the North
Korean border back to China.

00:48:12.330 --> 00:48:18.210
And so my question is, that
was when Kim Jong Il was still

00:48:18.210 --> 00:48:19.830
in dictatorship.

00:48:19.830 --> 00:48:27.870
So is the treatment of
civilians much better

00:48:27.870 --> 00:48:30.690
now that Kim Jong
Un is in state?

00:48:30.690 --> 00:48:33.097
Or even reunification?

00:48:36.650 --> 00:48:42.229
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:48:42.229 --> 00:48:44.020
INTERPRETER: So we are
not able to discover

00:48:44.020 --> 00:48:46.850
any concrete improvements
over the human rights

00:48:46.850 --> 00:48:48.160
situation in North Korea.

00:48:48.160 --> 00:48:52.125
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:48:52.125 --> 00:48:53.750
INTERPRETER: And I
can't say that there

00:48:53.750 --> 00:48:55.840
has been any
concrete improvement

00:48:55.840 --> 00:48:57.820
in the lives of everyday people.

00:48:57.820 --> 00:49:01.414
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:49:01.414 --> 00:49:02.830
INTERPRETER: And
say people do say

00:49:02.830 --> 00:49:04.750
that's Pyungyang,
the city itself,

00:49:04.750 --> 00:49:06.457
has become a little livelier.

00:49:06.457 --> 00:49:10.080
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:49:10.080 --> 00:49:11.580
INTERPRETER: And
it's in a way so we

00:49:11.580 --> 00:49:15.060
can see that the market
economy has expanded somewhat.

00:49:15.060 --> 00:49:18.960
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:49:18.960 --> 00:49:21.490
INTERPRETER: And the amount
of private ownership that

00:49:21.490 --> 00:49:23.490
are recognized
has also expanded.

00:49:23.490 --> 00:49:31.570
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:49:31.570 --> 00:49:33.760
INTERPRETER: So even
the collective farm

00:49:33.760 --> 00:49:35.090
has been divided.

00:49:35.090 --> 00:49:38.070
Not to individuals, per
se, but to smaller units,

00:49:38.070 --> 00:49:39.220
to family units.

00:49:39.220 --> 00:49:44.350
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:49:44.350 --> 00:49:49.730
INTERPRETER: And small firms
has been also transformed.

00:49:49.730 --> 00:49:52.710
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:49:52.710 --> 00:49:55.560
INTERPRETER: So there has been
a lot of changes on the line.

00:49:55.560 --> 00:49:58.660
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:49:58.660 --> 00:50:00.850
INTERPRETER: But in terms
of politics and military,

00:50:00.850 --> 00:50:02.800
there has been no change.

00:50:02.800 --> 00:50:07.694
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:50:07.694 --> 00:50:09.360
INTERPRETER: So we
still see no evidence

00:50:09.360 --> 00:50:12.680
that the quality of life
has improved for people.

00:50:15.372 --> 00:50:17.830
AUDIENCE: In your first answer
that was a really beautiful,

00:50:17.830 --> 00:50:23.480
you talked about the importance
of the how instead of the what.

00:50:23.480 --> 00:50:27.190
And I was wondering as people
try to go down this path

00:50:27.190 --> 00:50:30.190
and look more inwards,
how do you advise them

00:50:30.190 --> 00:50:34.280
in terms of spending
their time inwards.

00:50:34.280 --> 00:50:37.910
Maybe people come to you
for the monastic tradition.

00:50:37.910 --> 00:50:40.390
How do you advise people
of sort of the career

00:50:40.390 --> 00:50:43.437
or the worldly life versus
more of an inward life?

00:50:43.437 --> 00:50:44.395
Do you have any advice?

00:50:51.860 --> 00:50:55.530
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:50:55.530 --> 00:50:57.280
INTERPRETER: So if you
go out to the hill,

00:50:57.280 --> 00:51:01.030
if you see rabbits and
squirrels, you see them living.

00:51:01.030 --> 00:51:04.750
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:51:04.750 --> 00:51:06.970
INTERPRETER: So if human
beings are supposedly better

00:51:06.970 --> 00:51:08.470
than the other
animals, then there's

00:51:08.470 --> 00:51:10.960
no reason why we
shouldn't live better.

00:51:10.960 --> 00:51:12.985
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:51:12.985 --> 00:51:15.110
INTERPRETER: Have you ever
seen a rabbit suffering?

00:51:15.110 --> 00:51:16.060
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:51:16.060 --> 00:51:18.390
INTERPRETER: Have you ever
seen them commit suicide?

00:51:18.390 --> 00:51:20.280
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:51:20.280 --> 00:51:22.864
INTERPRETER: Have you ever seen
them turn jealous and envious?

00:51:22.864 --> 00:51:24.196
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:51:24.196 --> 00:51:25.380
INTERPRETER: They just live.

00:51:25.380 --> 00:51:27.274
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:51:27.274 --> 00:51:28.690
INTERPRETER: But
at the same time,

00:51:28.690 --> 00:51:31.500
I'm not saying that they live
very enjoyable lives as well.

00:51:31.500 --> 00:51:34.772
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:51:34.772 --> 00:51:36.730
INTERPRETER: So I believe
that as human beings,

00:51:36.730 --> 00:51:39.780
we should live at least
as well as animals.

00:51:39.780 --> 00:51:41.620
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:51:41.620 --> 00:51:44.570
INTERPRETER: So we don't have
to live super enjoyable lives.

00:51:44.570 --> 00:51:47.841
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:51:47.841 --> 00:51:49.840
INTERPRETER: But we should
not subject our lives

00:51:49.840 --> 00:51:51.870
to one of suffering, either.

00:51:51.870 --> 00:51:56.710
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:51:56.710 --> 00:51:59.950
INTERPRETER: So suffering really
arises not out of some survival

00:51:59.950 --> 00:52:04.370
need, but it comes
from our mind itself.

00:52:04.370 --> 00:52:08.990
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:52:08.990 --> 00:52:10.840
INTERPRETER: And
the fact is that it

00:52:10.840 --> 00:52:13.460
is possible to resolve the
source of your suffering

00:52:13.460 --> 00:52:16.240
if you spend enough
effort to explore it.

00:52:16.240 --> 00:52:18.642
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:52:18.642 --> 00:52:20.100
INTERPRETER: Of
course, institution

00:52:20.100 --> 00:52:23.350
could be changed or
improved to help us do that.

00:52:23.350 --> 00:52:26.050
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:52:26.050 --> 00:52:27.980
INTERPRETER: Because
the needs of an animal

00:52:27.980 --> 00:52:30.140
are survival needs, basic needs.

00:52:30.140 --> 00:52:33.315
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:52:33.315 --> 00:52:35.110
INTERPRETER: And
if they're hungry,

00:52:35.110 --> 00:52:38.167
when they eat their full,
then the need disappears.

00:52:38.167 --> 00:52:39.500
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:52:39.500 --> 00:52:41.500
INTERPRETER: But not
with human beings.

00:52:41.500 --> 00:52:46.640
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:52:46.640 --> 00:52:51.070
INTERPRETER: So I think to be
able to eat when you're hungry,

00:52:51.070 --> 00:52:53.230
I think that's one of
our basic human rights.

00:52:53.230 --> 00:52:55.420
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:52:55.420 --> 00:52:56.920
INTERPRETER: And
as institutions, we

00:52:56.920 --> 00:52:58.420
need to guarantee that right.

00:52:58.420 --> 00:53:00.280
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:53:00.280 --> 00:53:02.697
INTERPRETER: But to eat
better, richer food--

00:53:02.697 --> 00:53:04.030
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:53:04.030 --> 00:53:05.900
INTERPRETER: --to live
in a bigger house--

00:53:05.900 --> 00:53:08.060
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:53:08.060 --> 00:53:09.628
INTERPRETER: There's
no end to that.

00:53:09.628 --> 00:53:11.790
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:53:11.790 --> 00:53:13.940
INTERPRETER: I think those
kind of relative desires

00:53:13.940 --> 00:53:17.605
you need to moderate.

00:53:17.605 --> 00:53:20.054
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:53:20.054 --> 00:53:21.720
INTERPRETER: So there
are two solutions.

00:53:21.720 --> 00:53:23.290
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:53:23.290 --> 00:53:25.790
INTERPRETER: From a so social
infrastructure point of view--

00:53:25.790 --> 00:53:28.209
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:53:28.209 --> 00:53:29.750
INTERPRETER: --to
lessen the distance

00:53:29.750 --> 00:53:31.580
between the rich and poor.

00:53:31.580 --> 00:53:35.655
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:53:35.655 --> 00:53:37.280
INTERPRETER: Because
a sense of poverty

00:53:37.280 --> 00:53:40.890
is a relative term
compared to the rich.

00:53:40.890 --> 00:53:45.094
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:53:45.094 --> 00:53:47.010
INTERPRETER: But as
individuals, it's up to us

00:53:47.010 --> 00:53:49.177
to be able to
moderate our desires.

00:53:49.177 --> 00:53:50.510
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:53:50.510 --> 00:53:53.690
INTERPRETER: To let
go of your greed.

00:53:53.690 --> 00:54:02.440
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:54:02.440 --> 00:54:05.530
INTERPRETER: So this
conversation could really

00:54:05.530 --> 00:54:08.450
last a long time, so I
just want to conclude

00:54:08.450 --> 00:54:12.240
by saying that it is possible,
fully possible, for you to just

00:54:12.240 --> 00:54:15.010
make a little effort to
examine yourself and alleviate

00:54:15.010 --> 00:54:16.360
your source of suffering.

00:54:16.360 --> 00:54:21.980
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:54:21.980 --> 00:54:24.130
INTERPRETER: So as
employees of Google,

00:54:24.130 --> 00:54:27.350
what is it that's
causing your suffering?

00:54:27.350 --> 00:54:29.292
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:54:29.292 --> 00:54:31.000
INTERPRETER: You're
living in the richest

00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:32.480
country in the world.

00:54:32.480 --> 00:54:34.325
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:54:34.325 --> 00:54:37.000
INTERPRETER: And
you are employed

00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:40.660
by the best company in the
richest country in the world.

00:54:40.660 --> 00:54:42.224
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:54:42.224 --> 00:54:43.640
INTERPRETER: So
you are the object

00:54:43.640 --> 00:54:45.997
of envy for the
rest of the world.

00:54:45.997 --> 00:54:47.330
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:54:47.330 --> 00:54:49.470
INTERPRETER: If
you are suffering--

00:54:49.470 --> 00:54:51.330
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:54:51.330 --> 00:54:55.567
INTERPRETER: --then the rest of
us have no option but despair.

00:54:55.567 --> 00:54:56.900
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:54:56.900 --> 00:54:59.000
INTERPRETER: What are
we supposed to do, then?

00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:00.410
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:55:00.410 --> 00:55:02.790
INTERPRETER: So if we go on
the way we do now, then--

00:55:02.790 --> 00:55:05.831
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:55:05.831 --> 00:55:08.080
INTERPRETER: --we believe
that heaven is a good place.

00:55:08.080 --> 00:55:09.040
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:55:09.040 --> 00:55:10.170
INTERPRETER: If you
actually get there.

00:55:10.170 --> 00:55:11.730
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:55:11.730 --> 00:55:13.105
INTERPRETER: So
they are probably

00:55:13.105 --> 00:55:14.920
suffering, as well, then.

00:55:14.920 --> 00:55:16.870
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:55:16.870 --> 00:55:20.380
INTERPRETER: That's why we need
to kind of examine ourselves.

00:55:20.380 --> 00:55:23.960
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:55:23.960 --> 00:55:26.550
INTERPRETER: So for you to
live a little happier lives--

00:55:26.550 --> 00:55:28.460
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:55:28.460 --> 00:55:30.520
INTERPRETER: --it's good
for you as individuals.

00:55:30.520 --> 00:55:32.499
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:55:32.499 --> 00:55:34.790
INTERPRETER: But it is also
very important for the rest

00:55:34.790 --> 00:55:35.670
of humanity.

00:55:35.670 --> 00:55:41.630
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:55:41.630 --> 00:55:45.890
INTERPRETER: So if you
could expand your heart

00:55:45.890 --> 00:55:47.730
to help others a little bit--

00:55:47.730 --> 00:55:50.010
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:55:50.010 --> 00:55:51.660
INTERPRETER: --and
you will amplify

00:55:51.660 --> 00:55:53.640
your sense of happiness.

00:55:53.640 --> 00:55:55.970
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:55:55.970 --> 00:55:57.950
INTERPRETER: And really
improve the lives

00:55:57.950 --> 00:55:59.570
of others around the world.

00:55:59.570 --> 00:56:02.000
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:05.280
INTERPRETER: If you continue
just running straight ahead--

00:56:05.280 --> 00:56:08.537
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:56:08.537 --> 00:56:10.370
INTERPRETER: --you don't
know whether you're

00:56:10.370 --> 00:56:11.260
running into a cliff.

00:56:15.650 --> 00:56:19.240
AUDIENCE: So I'm
not sure if you're

00:56:19.240 --> 00:56:23.120
suggesting that happiness
is sort of the state

00:56:23.120 --> 00:56:24.730
that we should
ideally be seeking.

00:56:24.730 --> 00:56:27.830
But if it is, I
think to the people

00:56:27.830 --> 00:56:29.400
that I know who
are the happiest,

00:56:29.400 --> 00:56:32.760
and they're actually the
people that are most selfish.

00:56:32.760 --> 00:56:36.615
And I observe that they're
very happy because they spend--

00:56:36.615 --> 00:56:39.270
you know, all of our time
and energy are limited.

00:56:39.270 --> 00:56:41.540
And they spend that
time and energy

00:56:41.540 --> 00:56:43.890
on their own goals and
their own interests,

00:56:43.890 --> 00:56:45.760
and they don't
really help others.

00:56:45.760 --> 00:56:48.110
And that doesn't seem to
be the ideal way of living.

00:56:48.110 --> 00:56:50.150
The ideal way of
living seems to be

00:56:50.150 --> 00:56:52.940
some sort of balance between
seeking your own happiness,

00:56:52.940 --> 00:56:54.570
and also seeking
others' happiness.

00:56:54.570 --> 00:56:55.944
On the other end
of the spectrum,

00:56:55.944 --> 00:56:57.950
I see other people
who are very selfless

00:56:57.950 --> 00:56:59.900
and help a lot of
people selflessly,

00:56:59.900 --> 00:57:03.560
but actually because they're so
neglectful of their own needs,

00:57:03.560 --> 00:57:04.530
they're unhappy.

00:57:04.530 --> 00:57:07.480
So it seems like we need
some sort of balance, right?

00:57:07.480 --> 00:57:11.200
How would you suggest striking
an appropriate balance

00:57:11.200 --> 00:57:13.620
between addressing
other people's needs

00:57:13.620 --> 00:57:15.920
and increasing other
people's happiness,

00:57:15.920 --> 00:57:16.860
and our own happiness?

00:57:23.120 --> 00:57:27.750
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:57:27.750 --> 00:57:30.730
INTERPRETER: For example, I'm
carrying this heavy burden.

00:57:30.730 --> 00:57:37.080
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:57:37.080 --> 00:57:38.860
INTERPRETER: I look
down at the ground

00:57:38.860 --> 00:57:41.960
because this thing I'm
carrying is too heavy.

00:57:41.960 --> 00:57:45.157
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:57:45.157 --> 00:57:47.490
INTERPRETER: So I have no
idea what others are carrying,

00:57:47.490 --> 00:57:49.090
how heavy their burdens are.

00:57:49.090 --> 00:57:51.060
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:57:51.060 --> 00:57:52.560
INTERPRETER: And
even if I knew it--

00:57:52.560 --> 00:57:53.893
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:57:53.893 --> 00:57:56.640
INTERPRETER: --I have no
capacity to help them carry it.

00:57:56.640 --> 00:57:58.640
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:57:58.640 --> 00:58:01.600
INTERPRETER: But for example,
if I let go of more burden--

00:58:01.600 --> 00:58:03.882
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:58:03.882 --> 00:58:05.840
INTERPRETER: --then I
can actually look around.

00:58:05.840 --> 00:58:08.389
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:58:08.389 --> 00:58:10.430
INTERPRETER: Then I can
actually see other people

00:58:10.430 --> 00:58:11.960
carrying their burdens, as well.

00:58:11.960 --> 00:58:14.260
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:58:14.260 --> 00:58:16.610
INTERPRETER: And then
now I have capacity

00:58:16.610 --> 00:58:18.330
to help them if I wanted to.

00:58:18.330 --> 00:58:20.224
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:58:20.224 --> 00:58:21.640
INTERPRETER: That's
why first, you

00:58:21.640 --> 00:58:23.480
need to be happy
first and foremost.

00:58:23.480 --> 00:58:25.660
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:58:25.660 --> 00:58:27.970
INTERPRETER: But by saying
you need to be happy,

00:58:27.970 --> 00:58:30.417
I'm not saying only
you need to be happy.

00:58:30.417 --> 00:58:31.750
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:58:31.750 --> 00:58:34.000
INTERPRETER: First and
foremost, you need to be happy.

00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:37.760
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:58:37.760 --> 00:58:39.890
INTERPRETER: Then,
you have that capacity

00:58:39.890 --> 00:58:41.660
to help others be happy.

00:58:41.660 --> 00:58:44.390
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:58:44.390 --> 00:58:47.180
INTERPRETER: So if you think
you're sacrificing for others--

00:58:47.180 --> 00:58:49.297
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:58:49.297 --> 00:58:50.880
INTERPRETER: --that's
not sustainable.

00:58:50.880 --> 00:58:53.250
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:58:53.250 --> 00:58:55.940
INTERPRETER: Because we
have limits to our patience.

00:58:55.940 --> 00:58:59.170
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:58:59.170 --> 00:59:02.750
INTERPRETER: At some point
in time, you will explode.

00:59:02.750 --> 00:59:08.070
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:59:08.070 --> 00:59:10.460
INTERPRETER: However for
you to benefit selfishly

00:59:10.460 --> 00:59:13.867
while causing loss to others,
that's not sustainable, either.

00:59:13.867 --> 00:59:15.200
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:59:15.200 --> 00:59:17.420
INTERPRETER: Because then
the people who suffer loss,

00:59:17.420 --> 00:59:18.890
they won't be still.

00:59:18.890 --> 00:59:20.650
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:59:20.650 --> 00:59:22.735
INTERPRETER: That's why
it's not sustainable.

00:59:22.735 --> 00:59:24.260
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:59:24.260 --> 00:59:27.530
INTERPRETER: But for a sense of
happiness to be sustainable--

00:59:27.530 --> 00:59:30.180
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:59:30.180 --> 00:59:33.840
INTERPRETER: --you have to
achieve a state in which it's

00:59:33.840 --> 00:59:35.430
good for me and good for you.

00:59:35.430 --> 00:59:37.750
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:59:37.750 --> 00:59:40.210
INTERPRETER: So a temporary
state of happiness

00:59:40.210 --> 00:59:41.210
is not real happiness.

00:59:41.210 --> 00:59:42.560
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:59:42.560 --> 00:59:43.726
INTERPRETER: It's enjoyment.

00:59:43.726 --> 00:59:44.470
Perhaps pleasure.

00:59:44.470 --> 00:59:46.550
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:59:46.550 --> 00:59:48.960
INTERPRETER: But that enjoyment
needs to be sustainable.

00:59:48.960 --> 00:59:50.379
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:59:50.379 --> 00:59:52.420
INTERPRETER: And we can
define that as happiness.

00:59:52.420 --> 00:59:54.880
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:59:54.880 --> 00:59:57.450
INTERPRETER: To achieve that
state, it has to be good for me

00:59:57.450 --> 00:59:58.687
and good for you.

00:59:58.687 --> 01:00:00.020
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:00:00.020 --> 01:00:02.228
INTERPRETER: And that's the
beginning, starting gate.

01:00:02.228 --> 01:00:03.562
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:00:03.562 --> 01:00:06.061
INTERPRETER: The starting gate
should be you should be happy

01:00:06.061 --> 01:00:06.800
yourself.

01:00:06.800 --> 01:00:10.024
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:00:10.024 --> 01:00:11.940
INTERPRETER: And so even
when you help others,

01:00:11.940 --> 01:00:14.260
you must be happy
yourself helping others.

01:00:14.260 --> 01:00:15.989
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:00:15.989 --> 01:00:17.530
INTERPRETER: So when
you love others,

01:00:17.530 --> 01:00:20.070
it must cause
happiness within you.

01:00:20.070 --> 01:00:24.100
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:00:24.100 --> 01:00:27.070
INTERPRETER: So if helping
others causes you suffering,

01:00:27.070 --> 01:00:28.600
then it's not a good way.

01:00:28.600 --> 01:00:30.150
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:00:30.150 --> 01:00:31.566
INTERPRETER: Because
then you want

01:00:31.566 --> 01:00:33.350
some kind of
compensation in return.

01:00:33.350 --> 01:00:36.099
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:00:36.099 --> 01:00:37.640
INTERPRETER: So in
that, you actually

01:00:37.640 --> 01:00:40.550
cause a seed-- you
actually create enemies

01:00:40.550 --> 01:00:43.020
by helping with a
sense of compensation.

01:00:43.020 --> 01:00:47.039
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:00:47.039 --> 01:00:48.580
INTERPRETER: So you
have to recognize

01:00:48.580 --> 01:00:52.060
that helping others is actually
a way to make yourself happy.

01:00:52.060 --> 01:00:55.030
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:00:55.030 --> 01:00:58.130
INTERPRETER: So that, I don't
think, is self centeredness.

01:00:58.130 --> 01:01:04.140
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:01:04.140 --> 01:01:06.060
INTERPRETER: Because
I believe that trying

01:01:06.060 --> 01:01:09.620
to create a happier
world, the first step

01:01:09.620 --> 01:01:12.981
starts with your own happiness.

01:01:12.981 --> 01:01:14.980
MALE SPEAKER: The happiest
people I've never met

01:01:14.980 --> 01:01:17.225
are all people with no hair.

01:01:17.225 --> 01:01:18.600
So there's an
inverse correlation

01:01:18.600 --> 01:01:20.286
between hair and happiness.

01:01:20.286 --> 01:01:28.070
[LAUGHTER]

01:01:28.070 --> 01:01:30.340
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:01:30.340 --> 01:01:32.500
INTERPRETER: So for us to
shave our heads actually

01:01:32.500 --> 01:01:36.890
signifies that we
are very simple.

01:01:36.890 --> 01:01:42.600
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:01:42.600 --> 01:01:45.470
INTERPRETER: Because if you have
too much thoughts in your head,

01:01:45.470 --> 01:01:50.120
then that automatically
results in a heavier heart.

01:01:50.120 --> 01:01:52.072
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:01:52.072 --> 01:01:53.530
INTERPRETER: So
I'm just urging you

01:01:53.530 --> 01:01:56.440
to be a little light
headed in your thoughts.

01:01:56.440 --> 01:01:57.967
[LAUGHTER]

01:01:57.967 --> 01:01:59.550
MALE SPEAKER: OK,
maybe this gentlemen

01:01:59.550 --> 01:02:01.091
and then if there's
still a question,

01:02:01.091 --> 01:02:02.410
we can come back to you.

01:02:02.410 --> 01:02:04.860
AUDIENCE: Thank you for
your great teachings today.

01:02:04.860 --> 01:02:09.420
I'd like to ask the question
about like the ones related

01:02:09.420 --> 01:02:12.970
to the question about
the world itself.

01:02:12.970 --> 01:02:16.410
So you said in your
answer, you said

01:02:16.410 --> 01:02:20.320
like we have a lot of
problems in the world,

01:02:20.320 --> 01:02:23.120
but it has been like
that for a long time.

01:02:23.120 --> 01:02:28.010
But if you look at the companies
around the Silicon Valley,

01:02:28.010 --> 01:02:30.810
we see a lot of business like,
make the world a better place.

01:02:30.810 --> 01:02:33.060
Stuff like that.

01:02:33.060 --> 01:02:36.090
Do you think with this
technology and innovation,

01:02:36.090 --> 01:02:40.330
are we getting to a
better place as a world?

01:02:40.330 --> 01:02:45.400
I'd like to know your
opinions on the meanings

01:02:45.400 --> 01:02:49.145
of this innovation and
technology in our lives.

01:02:59.095 --> 01:03:01.190
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:03:01.190 --> 01:03:02.890
INTERPRETER: So I'm not sure.

01:03:02.890 --> 01:03:05.860
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:03:05.860 --> 01:03:08.140
INTERPRETER: If you use
technology for a good cause,

01:03:08.140 --> 01:03:09.598
then it will become
a better world.

01:03:09.598 --> 01:03:11.682
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:03:11.682 --> 01:03:13.640
INTERPRETER: And if you
use it for a bad cause,

01:03:13.640 --> 01:03:15.005
you'll create a worse world.

01:03:15.005 --> 01:03:17.417
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:03:17.417 --> 01:03:19.250
INTERPRETER: That's why
technology in itself

01:03:19.250 --> 01:03:21.420
is not efficient to
create a better world.

01:03:21.420 --> 01:03:28.740
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:03:28.740 --> 01:03:31.330
INTERPRETER: So
we need people who

01:03:31.330 --> 01:03:33.230
are willing to use
the technologies

01:03:33.230 --> 01:03:35.950
to the betterment of the world.

01:03:35.950 --> 01:03:39.910
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:03:39.910 --> 01:03:42.540
INTERPRETER: Because a better
weapon kills more people.

01:03:45.280 --> 01:03:52.290
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:03:52.290 --> 01:03:55.150
INTERPRETER: So a sharper knife
can be used very effectively

01:03:55.150 --> 01:03:56.650
for other things,
but it could also

01:03:56.650 --> 01:03:58.900
be used as a better weapon.

01:03:58.900 --> 01:04:02.760
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:04:02.760 --> 01:04:05.610
INTERPRETER: So it's not a
problem of the technology,

01:04:05.610 --> 01:04:07.650
for example, a
sharper knife itself.

01:04:07.650 --> 01:04:10.230
It's a problem of who wields it.

01:04:10.230 --> 01:04:12.520
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:04:12.520 --> 01:04:14.770
INTERPRETER: Because right
now, all you are focused on

01:04:14.770 --> 01:04:17.340
is creating a
sharper, better knife.

01:04:17.340 --> 01:04:19.032
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:04:19.032 --> 01:04:20.740
INTERPRETER: So you
might think that it's

01:04:20.740 --> 01:04:24.860
up to the people, whoever they
are, to use it to their end.

01:04:24.860 --> 01:04:27.020
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:04:27.020 --> 01:04:29.290
INTERPRETER: So
I don't think so.

01:04:29.290 --> 01:04:32.986
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:04:32.986 --> 01:04:34.860
INTERPRETER: So I think
it's part of your job

01:04:34.860 --> 01:04:38.711
to prepare people to be able to
use your technology to better

01:04:38.711 --> 01:04:39.210
ends.

01:04:39.210 --> 01:04:44.414
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:04:44.414 --> 01:04:46.830
INTERPRETER: Because you need
to actually set the example,

01:04:46.830 --> 01:04:50.120
exemplify how you could use
your technology to better ends

01:04:50.120 --> 01:04:52.195
so that people can
follow your lead.

01:04:52.195 --> 01:04:57.832
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:04:57.832 --> 01:04:59.790
INTERPRETER: Because if
you use your technology

01:04:59.790 --> 01:05:04.130
for enrichment of
individuals, or in bad ways,

01:05:04.130 --> 01:05:07.400
then people will follow
those examples, as well.

01:05:07.400 --> 01:05:10.230
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:05:10.230 --> 01:05:12.520
INTERPRETER: So I'm here
today partially related

01:05:12.520 --> 01:05:14.180
to that issue.

01:05:14.180 --> 01:05:16.990
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:05:16.990 --> 01:05:19.360
INTERPRETER: That you
yourself need to be happy.

01:05:19.360 --> 01:05:25.310
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:05:25.310 --> 01:05:26.685
INTERPRETER: And
to encourage you

01:05:26.685 --> 01:05:30.250
to take an interest in
how your technology can

01:05:30.250 --> 01:05:31.716
be used in good ways.

01:05:37.204 --> 01:05:38.370
MALE SPEAKER: Any questions?

01:05:38.370 --> 01:05:39.400
OK, back to the lady.

01:05:44.702 --> 01:05:47.940
AUDIENCE: Let's say,
OK, I have a loved one

01:05:47.940 --> 01:05:50.330
and there was a
misunderstanding.

01:05:50.330 --> 01:05:52.570
And there have been
many, many years where

01:05:52.570 --> 01:05:56.350
I've tried to clear up
the misunderstanding

01:05:56.350 --> 01:06:00.130
and it just hasn't cleared up.

01:06:00.130 --> 01:06:01.720
So it's been difficult for me.

01:06:01.720 --> 01:06:06.940
And the question is, until
when do I keep on trying.

01:06:06.940 --> 01:06:11.010
Or do I just, for my own
emotional lightness of being,

01:06:11.010 --> 01:06:14.810
just sever the
relationship and move on?

01:06:17.750 --> 01:06:19.466
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:06:19.466 --> 01:06:21.840
INTERPRETER: So why do you
think it's a misunderstanding?

01:06:21.840 --> 01:06:23.520
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:06:23.520 --> 01:06:25.020
INTERPRETER: It's
a misunderstanding

01:06:25.020 --> 01:06:26.250
from your perspective.

01:06:26.250 --> 01:06:27.874
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:06:27.874 --> 01:06:29.540
INTERPRETER: Maybe
from his perspective,

01:06:29.540 --> 01:06:30.890
it's not a misunderstanding.

01:06:30.890 --> 01:06:32.570
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:06:32.570 --> 01:06:36.490
INTERPRETER: So you need
to examine that first.

01:06:36.490 --> 01:06:40.550
AUDIENCE: Well, I guess
to be more open and honest

01:06:40.550 --> 01:06:43.370
about this-- so I
tried to explain

01:06:43.370 --> 01:06:47.790
as clear as possible
my true intention

01:06:47.790 --> 01:06:53.320
and the loved one is saying
that that's not true.

01:06:53.320 --> 01:06:57.184
So refuses to accept
what I'm saying.

01:06:57.184 --> 01:06:58.600
And then I don't
know where to go.

01:06:58.600 --> 01:07:01.150
Because I feel like I've
been fully honest and open,

01:07:01.150 --> 01:07:05.180
but the loved one
will not believe me.

01:07:05.180 --> 01:07:06.880
And accuses a
different intention.

01:07:09.710 --> 01:07:12.260
I don't know where to go.

01:07:12.260 --> 01:07:15.440
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:07:15.440 --> 01:07:18.170
INTERPRETER: So the
key to the situation

01:07:18.170 --> 01:07:19.840
is the fact that
you believe that he

01:07:19.840 --> 01:07:22.450
has a misunderstanding
that you want

01:07:22.450 --> 01:07:23.720
to continue the relationship.

01:07:27.930 --> 01:07:31.190
AUDIENCE: Well I guess it's
a loved one, it's a relative,

01:07:31.190 --> 01:07:36.310
and so I'd like to keep the
relationship going and strong.

01:07:36.310 --> 01:07:39.650
But again, I'm trying to
be honest with how I feel

01:07:39.650 --> 01:07:44.560
and my intentions, but the loved
one says that that's not true.

01:07:44.560 --> 01:07:47.350
So keeps on saying,
suggesting that I'm lying

01:07:47.350 --> 01:07:53.120
or misrepresenting how I really
feel, when I'm being honest.

01:07:53.120 --> 01:07:54.490
So that's my challenge.

01:07:54.490 --> 01:07:58.250
Do I keep on trying to
persuade with the truth which

01:07:58.250 --> 01:08:00.550
that person won't
accept, or do I

01:08:00.550 --> 01:08:02.920
somehow just try and
forget the person

01:08:02.920 --> 01:08:07.710
and leave and just kind
of sever the relationship

01:08:07.710 --> 01:08:10.094
and try and forget
that person completely?

01:08:10.094 --> 01:08:12.010
But it's difficult for
me, because that person

01:08:12.010 --> 01:08:13.510
is obviously a loved
one and I would

01:08:13.510 --> 01:08:16.939
like to improve the relationship
instead of run away.

01:08:19.840 --> 01:08:23.901
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:08:23.901 --> 01:08:25.359
INTERPRETER: So I
do understand you

01:08:25.359 --> 01:08:27.830
wanting to improve
the relationship,

01:08:27.830 --> 01:08:31.060
but you have to face the
fact that it's not improving.

01:08:31.060 --> 01:08:33.291
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:08:33.291 --> 01:08:34.790
INTERPRETER: So you
can't really get

01:08:34.790 --> 01:08:36.799
everything you
want in this life.

01:08:36.799 --> 01:08:39.399
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:08:39.399 --> 01:08:40.907
INTERPRETER: So
you can try more--

01:08:40.907 --> 01:08:42.240
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:08:42.240 --> 01:08:44.170
INTERPRETER: --or you can stop.

01:08:44.170 --> 01:08:48.860
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:08:48.860 --> 01:08:50.359
INTERPRETER: So if
you stop now, you

01:08:50.359 --> 01:08:52.890
feel maybe you didn't
try hard enough.

01:08:52.890 --> 01:08:55.392
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:08:55.392 --> 01:08:56.850
INTERPRETER: But
if you try harder,

01:08:56.850 --> 01:09:00.290
it's not going to be
easy to resolve, either.

01:09:00.290 --> 01:09:02.749
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:09:02.749 --> 01:09:04.540
INTERPRETER: But instead
of looking to him,

01:09:04.540 --> 01:09:06.239
look at yourself.

01:09:06.239 --> 01:09:10.330
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:09:10.330 --> 01:09:13.359
INTERPRETER: But ultimately,
the essence of the problem

01:09:13.359 --> 01:09:16.470
is you don't want to be
criticized or misunderstood.

01:09:16.470 --> 01:09:18.250
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:09:18.250 --> 01:09:20.880
INTERPRETER: Let's say he
did have a misunderstanding.

01:09:20.880 --> 01:09:22.213
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:09:22.213 --> 01:09:24.630
INTERPRETER: Then he was hurt
by that misunderstanding.

01:09:24.630 --> 01:09:26.160
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:09:26.160 --> 01:09:27.910
INTERPRETER: So, well,
let him insult you.

01:09:27.910 --> 01:09:28.797
Let him curse at you.

01:09:28.797 --> 01:09:30.130
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:09:30.130 --> 01:09:31.470
INTERPRETER: And
accept it willingly.

01:09:31.470 --> 01:09:32.569
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:09:32.569 --> 01:09:34.277
INTERPRETER: Instead
of criticizing him--

01:09:34.277 --> 01:09:35.919
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:09:35.919 --> 01:09:37.960
INTERPRETER: --allow him
to insult you even more.

01:09:37.960 --> 01:09:40.642
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:09:40.642 --> 01:09:42.350
INTERPRETER: So if
you think that's going

01:09:42.350 --> 01:09:44.677
to help him overcome his anger.

01:09:44.677 --> 01:09:46.010
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:09:46.010 --> 01:09:47.801
INTERPRETER: Then go
ahead, insult me more.

01:09:47.801 --> 01:09:51.490
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:09:51.490 --> 01:09:53.859
INTERPRETER: So be
lighthearted in your approach.

01:09:53.859 --> 01:09:56.730
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:09:56.730 --> 01:09:58.780
INTERPRETER: Then you
won't feel such impatience

01:09:58.780 --> 01:10:00.090
at resolving this situation.

01:10:00.090 --> 01:10:01.999
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:10:01.999 --> 01:10:03.790
INTERPRETER: If he
avoids you, then there's

01:10:03.790 --> 01:10:04.637
nothing you can do.

01:10:04.637 --> 01:10:05.970
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:10:05.970 --> 01:10:08.280
INTERPRETER: But you have
no reason to avoid him.

01:10:08.280 --> 01:10:09.882
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:10:09.882 --> 01:10:11.340
INTERPRETER: Because
you're already

01:10:11.340 --> 01:10:13.740
prepared to take whatever
he throws at you.

01:10:13.740 --> 01:10:16.580
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:10:16.580 --> 01:10:19.690
INTERPRETER: Then you free
yourself from the result,

01:10:19.690 --> 01:10:22.150
whether the situation
improves or not.

01:10:22.150 --> 01:10:23.619
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:10:23.619 --> 01:10:25.160
INTERPRETER: Because
you can't always

01:10:25.160 --> 01:10:26.567
have people praising you.

01:10:26.567 --> 01:10:27.900
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:10:27.900 --> 01:10:29.899
INTERPRETER: Because even
Buddha was criticized.

01:10:29.899 --> 01:10:31.960
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:10:31.960 --> 01:10:35.326
INTERPRETER: And Jesus was
misunderstood and crucified.

01:10:35.326 --> 01:10:37.149
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:10:37.149 --> 01:10:39.190
INTERPRETER: So even those
sages were criticized.

01:10:39.190 --> 01:10:40.981
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:10:40.981 --> 01:10:42.480
INTERPRETER: So
people like us, it's

01:10:42.480 --> 01:10:44.927
no big deal for us to be
insulted and criticized.

01:10:44.927 --> 01:10:46.260
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:10:46.260 --> 01:10:48.220
INTERPRETER: So be
willing to accept that.

01:10:48.220 --> 01:10:49.300
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:10:49.300 --> 01:10:50.383
INTERPRETER: Then it's OK.

01:10:50.383 --> 01:10:52.230
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:10:52.230 --> 01:10:55.210
INTERPRETER: First and foremost,
you have to open yourself up.

01:10:55.210 --> 01:10:56.570
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:10:56.570 --> 01:10:58.903
INTERPRETER: Instead of
trying to resolve something--

01:10:58.903 --> 01:11:00.800
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:11:00.800 --> 01:11:03.150
INTERPRETER: --just understand
that he does have a scar.

01:11:03.150 --> 01:11:04.483
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:11:04.483 --> 01:11:07.400
INTERPRETER: And just encourage
him to criticize you even more.

01:11:07.400 --> 01:11:08.250
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:11:08.250 --> 01:11:10.150
INTERPRETER: And be
receptive to all that.

01:11:10.150 --> 01:11:11.700
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:11:11.700 --> 01:11:13.700
INTERPRETER: And if
you have that attitude,

01:11:13.700 --> 01:11:15.597
then nothing is an issue.

01:11:15.597 --> 01:11:16.930
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:11:16.930 --> 01:11:18.330
INTERPRETER: What do you think?

01:11:18.330 --> 01:11:24.170
AUDIENCE: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:11:24.170 --> 01:11:26.900
AUDIENCE: You said
that to be happy,

01:11:26.900 --> 01:11:30.980
we have to remove
our greediness.

01:11:30.980 --> 01:11:33.740
It sounds very simple,
but in practice it's

01:11:33.740 --> 01:11:36.810
very difficult to
remove our greediness.

01:11:36.810 --> 01:11:40.619
So can you suggest how can
we practice in our life

01:11:40.619 --> 01:11:41.660
to remove our greediness?

01:11:44.260 --> 01:11:47.705
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:11:47.705 --> 01:11:49.080
INTERPRETER: An
option is for you

01:11:49.080 --> 01:11:51.190
to hold on to your
greediness and suffer.

01:11:53.890 --> 01:11:55.920
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:11:55.920 --> 01:11:57.650
INTERPRETER: But if
you suffer enough,

01:11:57.650 --> 01:12:01.810
if the suffering is severe
enough, then you will let go.

01:12:01.810 --> 01:12:03.460
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:12:03.460 --> 01:12:07.180
INTERPRETER: For example,
let's say this object is hot.

01:12:07.180 --> 01:12:08.790
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:12:08.790 --> 01:12:10.350
INTERPRETER: So if I grab it--

01:12:10.350 --> 01:12:11.683
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:12:11.683 --> 01:12:13.417
INTERPRETER: --how do I react?

01:12:13.417 --> 01:12:14.750
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:12:14.750 --> 01:12:17.197
INTERPRETER: Then I let go.

01:12:17.197 --> 01:12:18.530
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:12:18.530 --> 01:12:20.290
INTERPRETER: But if I'm
holding on to this hot object--

01:12:20.290 --> 01:12:21.660
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:12:21.660 --> 01:12:24.170
INTERPRETER: --and I say I'm
suffering because this is hot,

01:12:24.170 --> 01:12:24.677
this is hot.

01:12:24.677 --> 01:12:26.010
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:12:26.010 --> 01:12:27.860
INTERPRETER: And so
I say, let it go.

01:12:27.860 --> 01:12:28.870
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:12:28.870 --> 01:12:29.890
INTERPRETER: Then he says--

01:12:29.890 --> 01:12:31.060
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:12:31.060 --> 01:12:32.809
INTERPRETER: --give
me a way to let it go.

01:12:32.809 --> 01:12:34.995
Teach me a methodology
to let it go.

01:12:34.995 --> 01:12:36.750
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:12:36.750 --> 01:12:39.130
INTERPRETER: So is it because
of a lack of methodology

01:12:39.130 --> 01:12:40.450
that you don't let go?

01:12:40.450 --> 01:12:41.120
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:12:41.120 --> 01:12:41.870
INTERPRETER: No.

01:12:41.870 --> 01:12:43.960
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:12:43.960 --> 01:12:46.780
INTERPRETER: It's because
your greed is on holding it.

01:12:46.780 --> 01:12:48.380
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:12:48.380 --> 01:12:50.090
INTERPRETER: So if you
do want to hold onto it--

01:12:50.090 --> 01:12:51.423
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:12:51.423 --> 01:12:53.517
INTERPRETER: --then
burn yourself.

01:12:53.517 --> 01:12:54.850
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:12:54.850 --> 01:12:56.440
INTERPRETER: But if you
don't want to burn yourself--

01:12:56.440 --> 01:12:57.650
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:12:57.650 --> 01:12:58.730
INTERPRETER: --just let go.

01:12:58.730 --> 01:13:00.063
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:13:00.063 --> 01:13:03.236
INTERPRETER: So it's not
an issue of methodology.

01:13:03.236 --> 01:13:05.879
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:13:05.879 --> 01:13:07.420
INTERPRETER: So
that's what we teach.

01:13:07.420 --> 01:13:10.140
If you know that
it's hot, let it go.

01:13:10.140 --> 01:13:11.880
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:13:11.880 --> 01:13:14.035
INTERPRETER: And just let it go.

01:13:14.035 --> 01:13:16.595
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:13:16.595 --> 01:13:18.970
INTERPRETER: So basically it
means in Chinese characters,

01:13:18.970 --> 01:13:21.330
just let it go.

01:13:21.330 --> 01:13:22.930
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:13:22.930 --> 01:13:25.290
INTERPRETER: Then people
still keep asking questions.

01:13:25.290 --> 01:13:26.240
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:13:26.240 --> 01:13:28.239
INTERPRETER: Please teach
me a way to let it go.

01:13:28.239 --> 01:13:29.750
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:13:29.750 --> 01:13:32.040
INTERPRETER: So that's
why as a last option,

01:13:32.040 --> 01:13:35.070
I tell them then throw
it to your left hand.

01:13:35.070 --> 01:13:36.570
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:13:36.570 --> 01:13:38.859
INTERPRETER: And
so they yell at me,

01:13:38.859 --> 01:13:40.150
why didn't you teach me sooner?

01:13:40.150 --> 01:13:42.100
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:13:42.100 --> 01:13:44.260
INTERPRETER: Because I just
solved how hot it was--

01:13:44.260 --> 01:13:45.290
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:13:45.290 --> 01:13:47.540
INTERPRETER: --and then I
still keep holding on to it.

01:13:47.540 --> 01:13:49.062
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:13:49.062 --> 01:13:50.770
INTERPRETER: So it
looks like a solution.

01:13:50.770 --> 01:13:52.010
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:13:52.010 --> 01:13:53.845
INTERPRETER: Then eventually
your left hand gets hot.

01:13:53.845 --> 01:13:55.130
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:13:55.130 --> 01:13:56.140
INTERPRETER: Then he
keeps complaining,

01:13:56.140 --> 01:13:57.330
my left hand is hot.

01:13:57.330 --> 01:13:59.010
So I said, put it on your thigh.

01:13:59.010 --> 01:13:59.950
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:13:59.950 --> 01:14:01.520
INTERPRETER: So he said wow,
that's a great solution.

01:14:01.520 --> 01:14:02.490
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:14:02.490 --> 01:14:04.250
INTERPRETER: Because
neither of my hands are hot.

01:14:04.250 --> 01:14:04.930
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:14:04.930 --> 01:14:06.220
INTERPRETER: I still
hold on to the bottle.

01:14:06.220 --> 01:14:07.390
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:14:07.390 --> 01:14:09.515
INTERPRETER: But then again,
your knees become hot.

01:14:09.515 --> 01:14:10.930
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:14:10.930 --> 01:14:12.587
INTERPRETER: So after
five such steps--

01:14:12.587 --> 01:14:13.920
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:14:13.920 --> 01:14:15.720
INTERPRETER: If you
finally let it go--

01:14:15.720 --> 01:14:17.280
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:14:17.280 --> 01:14:20.070
INTERPRETER: --is
that a good way?

01:14:20.070 --> 01:14:21.710
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:14:21.710 --> 01:14:23.460
INTERPRETER: These
were nonessential ways,

01:14:23.460 --> 01:14:25.200
useless ways.

01:14:25.200 --> 01:14:26.534
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:14:26.534 --> 01:14:27.991
INTERPRETER: So
that's why you have

01:14:27.991 --> 01:14:29.740
to go to the core
of the problem.

01:14:29.740 --> 01:14:31.440
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:14:31.440 --> 01:14:32.898
INTERPRETER: So
it's not the matter

01:14:32.898 --> 01:14:34.447
of not knowing the
right methodology.

01:14:34.447 --> 01:14:35.780
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:14:35.780 --> 01:14:37.930
INTERPRETER: You just
don't want to let it go.

01:14:37.930 --> 01:14:40.472
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:14:40.472 --> 01:14:41.930
INTERPRETER: So
you say you suffer,

01:14:41.930 --> 01:14:43.585
but you don't want to let it go.

01:14:43.585 --> 01:14:47.312
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:14:47.312 --> 01:14:48.770
INTERPRETER: So
then you have to be

01:14:48.770 --> 01:14:51.045
able to deal with the suffering.

01:14:51.045 --> 01:14:52.604
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:14:52.604 --> 01:14:53.770
INTERPRETER: Why do we live?

01:14:53.770 --> 01:14:55.110
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:14:55.110 --> 01:14:56.860
INTERPRETER: Do we
live to suffer, though?

01:14:56.860 --> 01:14:58.193
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:14:58.193 --> 01:15:01.137
INTERPRETER: If that's not it--

01:15:01.137 --> 01:15:02.470
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:15:02.470 --> 01:15:04.220
INTERPRETER: --then
you have to let it go.

01:15:06.550 --> 01:15:08.180
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:15:08.180 --> 01:15:10.430
INTERPRETER: So I do understand
how difficult this is.

01:15:10.430 --> 01:15:11.770
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:15:11.770 --> 01:15:12.960
INTERPRETER: To a smoker--

01:15:12.960 --> 01:15:15.350
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:15:15.350 --> 01:15:17.270
INTERPRETER: --how does
a smoker quit smoking?

01:15:17.270 --> 01:15:18.730
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:15:18.730 --> 01:15:20.270
INTERPRETER: And
my answer is easy.

01:15:20.270 --> 01:15:21.603
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:15:21.603 --> 01:15:24.160
INTERPRETER: Stop smoking.

01:15:24.160 --> 01:15:25.770
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:15:25.770 --> 01:15:27.505
INTERPRETER: So
everybody understands it.

01:15:27.505 --> 01:15:28.839
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:15:28.839 --> 01:15:30.546
INTERPRETER: But
there's one who doesn't.

01:15:30.546 --> 01:15:32.020
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:15:32.020 --> 01:15:33.740
INTERPRETER: The smoker
does not understand it.

01:15:33.740 --> 01:15:34.650
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:15:34.650 --> 01:15:36.645
INTERPRETER: He says,
how can I stop smoking?

01:15:36.645 --> 01:15:38.506
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:15:38.506 --> 01:15:39.880
INTERPRETER: So
by that question,

01:15:39.880 --> 01:15:42.520
he's actually implying that
he wants to continue smoking.

01:15:42.520 --> 01:15:44.676
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:15:44.676 --> 01:15:46.550
INTERPRETER: His
consciousness is telling him

01:15:46.550 --> 01:15:47.716
that he should stop smoking.

01:15:47.716 --> 01:15:50.470
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:15:50.470 --> 01:15:52.480
INTERPRETER: But
his subconsciousness

01:15:52.480 --> 01:15:54.070
wants to continue smoking.

01:15:54.070 --> 01:15:55.450
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:15:55.450 --> 01:15:57.090
INTERPRETER: So it's a habit.

01:15:57.090 --> 01:15:59.090
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:15:59.090 --> 01:16:01.280
INTERPRETER: Habits are
difficult to get rid of.

01:16:01.280 --> 01:16:03.310
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:16:03.310 --> 01:16:05.760
INTERPRETER: So you have to
choose two options, then.

01:16:05.760 --> 01:16:07.910
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:16:07.910 --> 01:16:10.980
INTERPRETER: So provide
a strong anti stimulus.

01:16:10.980 --> 01:16:13.459
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:16:13.459 --> 01:16:15.000
INTERPRETER: A
stimulus strong enough

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:18.090
to delve and reach down
into your subconscious.

01:16:18.090 --> 01:16:21.385
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:16:21.385 --> 01:16:22.760
INTERPRETER: For
example, say you

01:16:22.760 --> 01:16:25.947
put some kind of
electronics on your filter.

01:16:25.947 --> 01:16:27.280
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:16:27.280 --> 01:16:28.780
INTERPRETER: So it
gives you shock--

01:16:28.780 --> 01:16:30.260
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:16:30.260 --> 01:16:32.801
INTERPRETER: --every time you
smoke, you put it to your lips.

01:16:32.801 --> 01:16:35.350
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:16:35.350 --> 01:16:38.497
INTERPRETER: It's strong
enough for you to faint.

01:16:38.497 --> 01:16:39.830
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:16:39.830 --> 01:16:41.730
INTERPRETER: If you repeat
this several times--

01:16:41.730 --> 01:16:42.810
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:16:42.810 --> 01:16:44.601
INTERPRETER: --then it
is your subconscious

01:16:44.601 --> 01:16:46.750
that develops a fear,
an aversion to smoking.

01:16:46.750 --> 01:16:48.950
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:16:48.950 --> 01:16:50.680
INTERPRETER: So there's
a way to do that

01:16:50.680 --> 01:16:53.170
by using that kind of
strong anti stimulus.

01:16:53.170 --> 01:16:56.142
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:16:56.142 --> 01:16:58.600
INTERPRETER: For example, if
you want to control your anger

01:16:58.600 --> 01:17:00.030
management, it's very difficult.

01:17:00.030 --> 01:17:01.110
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:17:01.110 --> 01:17:02.740
INTERPRETER: If you really,
really want to fix it--

01:17:02.740 --> 01:17:03.880
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:17:03.880 --> 01:17:05.713
INTERPRETER: --every
time you become angry--

01:17:05.713 --> 01:17:08.140
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:17:08.140 --> 01:17:11.137
INTERPRETER: --so take some car
batteries and shock yourself.

01:17:11.137 --> 01:17:12.470
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:17:12.470 --> 01:17:14.070
INTERPRETER: You
do it just 5 times.

01:17:14.070 --> 01:17:16.712
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:17:16.712 --> 01:17:18.170
INTERPRETER: Then
the next time you

01:17:18.170 --> 01:17:19.940
feel yourself getting
angry, your body

01:17:19.940 --> 01:17:21.480
will react and start shaking.

01:17:21.480 --> 01:17:24.062
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:17:24.062 --> 01:17:26.020
INTERPRETER: But is there
really a need for you

01:17:26.020 --> 01:17:28.170
to go that far to fix a habit?

01:17:28.170 --> 01:17:29.700
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:17:29.700 --> 01:17:32.737
INTERPRETER: That's why
you end up not fixing it.

01:17:32.737 --> 01:17:34.070
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:17:34.070 --> 01:17:35.778
INTERPRETER: But the
second solution is--

01:17:35.778 --> 01:17:37.230
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:17:37.230 --> 01:17:39.520
INTERPRETER: --to
actually do this

01:17:39.520 --> 01:17:41.230
over a long time, consistently.

01:17:41.230 --> 01:17:50.102
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:17:50.102 --> 01:17:51.560
INTERPRETER: So
whatever choice you

01:17:51.560 --> 01:17:52.935
make, whatever
decision you make,

01:17:52.935 --> 01:17:56.355
consciously you have to
train yourself to carry it

01:17:56.355 --> 01:17:59.090
on consistently over
a long period of time.

01:17:59.090 --> 01:18:01.280
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:18:01.280 --> 01:18:03.760
INTERPRETER: Until
that state of conscious

01:18:03.760 --> 01:18:05.085
affects your subconscious.

01:18:05.085 --> 01:18:07.074
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:18:07.074 --> 01:18:09.240
INTERPRETER: So if you
repeat something long enough,

01:18:09.240 --> 01:18:10.650
it becomes a habit.

01:18:10.650 --> 01:18:12.861
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:18:12.861 --> 01:18:14.610
INTERPRETER: If something
becomes a habit,

01:18:14.610 --> 01:18:18.010
it means you have made it into
part of your subconscious.

01:18:18.010 --> 01:18:19.497
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:18:19.497 --> 01:18:21.580
INTERPRETER: The same thing
as the law of physics.

01:18:21.580 --> 01:18:25.020
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:18:25.020 --> 01:18:27.370
INTERPRETER: So there are
properties to objects.

01:18:27.370 --> 01:18:35.970
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:18:35.970 --> 01:18:39.340
INTERPRETER: So we all know
about the law of inertia.

01:18:39.340 --> 01:18:42.150
Anything that's in movement
want to continue moving.

01:18:42.150 --> 01:18:44.997
Anything that stops wants
to continue stopping.

01:18:44.997 --> 01:18:46.330
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:18:46.330 --> 01:18:47.310
INTERPRETER: We all
know this, right?

01:18:47.310 --> 01:18:48.020
In physics?

01:18:48.020 --> 01:18:49.834
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:18:49.834 --> 01:18:52.000
INTERPRETER: For example,
this is moving towards me.

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:53.660
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:18:53.660 --> 01:18:54.770
INTERPRETER: And I
have to stop this.

01:18:54.770 --> 01:18:55.700
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:18:55.700 --> 01:18:57.241
INTERPRETER: There
are only two ways.

01:18:57.241 --> 01:18:58.700
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:18:58.700 --> 01:19:01.240
INTERPRETER: Stop it with
a strong force against it--

01:19:01.240 --> 01:19:02.240
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:19:02.240 --> 01:19:04.656
INTERPRETER: --then it'll stop
after pushing a little bit.

01:19:04.656 --> 01:19:07.332
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:19:07.332 --> 01:19:08.790
INTERPRETER: But
if you want to use

01:19:08.790 --> 01:19:10.530
small strength,
force, to stop it--

01:19:10.530 --> 01:19:12.120
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:19:12.120 --> 01:19:14.456
INTERPRETER: --then it'll
take a while before it stops.

01:19:14.456 --> 01:19:20.594
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:19:20.594 --> 01:19:22.260
INTERPRETER: So there
are only two ways.

01:19:22.260 --> 01:19:26.400
To use a strong force to stop
in short time, or smaller

01:19:26.400 --> 01:19:28.660
force to stop over a
long period of time.

01:19:28.660 --> 01:19:31.600
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:19:31.600 --> 01:19:33.867
INTERPRETER: But we don't
want to use a strong force.

01:19:33.867 --> 01:19:35.200
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:19:35.200 --> 01:19:36.980
INTERPRETER: And we
are not consistent.

01:19:36.980 --> 01:19:41.960
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:19:41.960 --> 01:19:44.040
INTERPRETER: That's
why we allow our karma

01:19:44.040 --> 01:19:47.880
to self amplify itself
over and over again.

01:19:47.880 --> 01:19:49.265
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:19:49.265 --> 01:19:51.640
INTERPRETER: That's why you
don't see any transformation.

01:19:51.640 --> 01:19:52.740
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:19:52.740 --> 01:19:55.340
INTERPRETER: And say because you
don't see the transformation,

01:19:55.340 --> 01:19:58.077
you say this is unfixable.

01:19:58.077 --> 01:19:59.410
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:19:59.410 --> 01:20:02.060
INTERPRETER: This is something
that I was born with.

01:20:02.060 --> 01:20:03.635
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:20:03.635 --> 01:20:05.510
INTERPRETER: That's why
in Chinese tradition,

01:20:05.510 --> 01:20:07.490
you have the stars.

01:20:07.490 --> 01:20:10.710
By the date and time you're born
with, your fortune is fixed.

01:20:10.710 --> 01:20:12.387
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:20:12.387 --> 01:20:13.845
INTERPRETER: In
India, your destiny

01:20:13.845 --> 01:20:16.855
is fixed by what you did
in your previous lifetime.

01:20:16.855 --> 01:20:18.710
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:20:18.710 --> 01:20:20.740
INTERPRETER: And in
Western theistic tradition,

01:20:20.740 --> 01:20:23.150
it's God who preordained
your destiny.

01:20:23.150 --> 01:20:26.757
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:20:26.757 --> 01:20:28.590
INTERPRETER: Because
change is so difficult,

01:20:28.590 --> 01:20:31.010
they're saying that
change does not happen.

01:20:31.010 --> 01:20:32.140
It's preordained.

01:20:32.140 --> 01:20:34.000
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:35.250
INTERPRETER: By that's not so.

01:20:35.250 --> 01:20:37.010
Nothing is unchanging.

01:20:37.010 --> 01:20:38.582
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:20:38.582 --> 01:20:40.290
INTERPRETER: Because
a karma is something

01:20:40.290 --> 01:20:42.117
that has been manufactured.

01:20:42.117 --> 01:20:43.450
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:20:43.450 --> 01:20:45.540
INTERPRETER: So as
such, it does change.

01:20:45.540 --> 01:20:46.874
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:20:46.874 --> 01:20:48.540
INTERPRETER: But to
change it, however--

01:20:48.540 --> 01:20:49.874
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:20:49.874 --> 01:20:51.165
INTERPRETER: --it is difficult.

01:20:51.165 --> 01:20:52.510
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:20:52.510 --> 01:20:54.384
INTERPRETER: Because it
has been manufactured

01:20:54.384 --> 01:20:55.820
over a long period of time.

01:20:55.820 --> 01:20:59.395
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:20:59.395 --> 01:21:01.100
INTERPRETER: The
earlier it was formed,

01:21:01.100 --> 01:21:02.740
the less change it experiences.

01:21:02.740 --> 01:21:08.060
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:21:08.060 --> 01:21:10.280
INTERPRETER: So either do
it forcefully, or do it

01:21:10.280 --> 01:21:12.270
over a long period of time.

01:21:12.270 --> 01:21:15.290
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:21:15.290 --> 01:21:16.830
INTERPRETER: By
doing so, anybody

01:21:16.830 --> 01:21:18.510
can actually affect change.

01:21:18.510 --> 01:21:20.300
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:21:20.300 --> 01:21:22.337
INTERPRETER: But we
never actually even try.

01:21:22.337 --> 01:21:23.670
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:21:23.670 --> 01:21:25.350
INTERPRETER: We
just want change.

01:21:25.350 --> 01:21:27.410
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:21:27.410 --> 01:21:30.020
INTERPRETER: But we don't put
the requisite effort behind.

01:21:30.020 --> 01:21:31.437
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:21:31.437 --> 01:21:33.770
INTERPRETER: Even if we
actually spend a little effort--

01:21:33.770 --> 01:21:35.330
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:21:35.330 --> 01:21:37.705
INTERPRETER: --we give up and
say, eh, it's not worth it.

01:21:37.705 --> 01:21:38.360
Didn't happen.

01:21:38.360 --> 01:21:42.550
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:21:42.550 --> 01:21:45.416
INTERPRETER: So do it forcefully
over a long period of time.

01:21:45.416 --> 01:21:48.220
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:21:48.220 --> 01:21:51.480
INTERPRETER: Then you can
change, no matter who you are.

01:21:51.480 --> 01:21:58.300
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:21:58.300 --> 01:22:00.970
INTERPRETER: So intellectually
understanding this concept,

01:22:00.970 --> 01:22:04.490
intellectually it is an
activity of the consciousness.

01:22:04.490 --> 01:22:07.165
So it doesn't really affect
change fundamentally.

01:22:07.165 --> 01:22:10.687
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:22:10.687 --> 01:22:12.520
INTERPRETER: But if
your heart, for example,

01:22:12.520 --> 01:22:15.465
if your heart is moved over
a story that you hear--

01:22:15.465 --> 01:22:16.860
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:22:16.860 --> 01:22:18.526
INTERPRETER: --then
that makes it easier

01:22:18.526 --> 01:22:20.150
for you to change
your behaviors.

01:22:20.150 --> 01:22:23.350
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:22:23.350 --> 01:22:25.100
INTERPRETER: For your
heart to have moved,

01:22:25.100 --> 01:22:27.058
that means you have
affected your subconscious.

01:22:29.350 --> 01:22:33.870
MALE SPEAKER: Sunim, in closing,
if we remember only one thing

01:22:33.870 --> 01:22:35.790
from today, what do you
want us to remember?

01:22:41.439 --> 01:22:44.246
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:22:44.246 --> 01:22:45.870
INTERPRETER: Try to
suppress something.

01:22:45.870 --> 01:22:47.900
Try to be patient
against something.

01:22:47.900 --> 01:22:49.260
It's not a good thing.

01:22:49.260 --> 01:22:51.039
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:22:51.039 --> 01:22:52.955
INTERPRETER: For example,
if you become angry,

01:22:52.955 --> 01:22:56.382
you express your anger.

01:22:56.382 --> 01:22:58.650
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:22:58.650 --> 01:23:02.220
INTERPRETER: Then the target
of your anger becomes stressed.

01:23:02.220 --> 01:23:03.790
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:23:03.790 --> 01:23:06.040
INTERPRETER: And that anger
comes right back at you.

01:23:06.040 --> 01:23:07.240
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:23:07.240 --> 01:23:08.840
INTERPRETER: Then that
amplifies your anger.

01:23:08.840 --> 01:23:10.040
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:23:10.040 --> 01:23:12.280
INTERPRETER: So you're
actually mutually amplifying.

01:23:12.280 --> 01:23:13.790
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:23:13.790 --> 01:23:15.650
INTERPRETER: It is
a foolish option.

01:23:15.650 --> 01:23:21.309
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:23:21.309 --> 01:23:23.100
INTERPRETER: That's
why as a second option,

01:23:23.100 --> 01:23:25.280
we tell people to
suppress your anger.

01:23:25.280 --> 01:23:27.881
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:23:27.881 --> 01:23:30.130
INTERPRETER: So at least you
don't transfer your anger

01:23:30.130 --> 01:23:31.007
to the other person.

01:23:31.007 --> 01:23:32.340
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:23:32.340 --> 01:23:34.855
INTERPRETER: So you stop it
from amplifying the situation.

01:23:34.855 --> 01:23:36.430
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:23:36.430 --> 01:23:37.610
INTERPRETER: So from
that sense, that's

01:23:37.610 --> 01:23:38.947
a good method from the outside.

01:23:38.947 --> 01:23:40.280
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:23:40.280 --> 01:23:42.600
INTERPRETER: And you get
praised for being patient.

01:23:42.600 --> 01:23:44.390
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:23:44.390 --> 01:23:46.875
INTERPRETER: But then you
create stress for yourself.

01:23:46.875 --> 01:23:49.007
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:23:49.007 --> 01:23:51.090
INTERPRETER: So a lot of
us experience that state.

01:23:51.090 --> 01:23:53.725
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:23:53.725 --> 01:23:55.100
INTERPRETER: So
that, ultimately,

01:23:55.100 --> 01:23:56.350
is not really good for you.

01:23:56.350 --> 01:23:57.700
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:23:57.700 --> 01:23:59.650
INTERPRETER: So we said, don't
even suppress your anger.

01:23:59.650 --> 01:24:00.760
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:24:00.760 --> 01:24:02.650
INTERPRETER: Then people
ask, then what can I do?

01:24:02.650 --> 01:24:03.810
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:24:03.810 --> 01:24:05.110
INTERPRETER: You tell
me not to get angry--

01:24:05.110 --> 01:24:05.820
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:24:05.820 --> 01:24:07.160
INTERPRETER: --then
don't even suppress it.

01:24:07.160 --> 01:24:07.640
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:24:07.640 --> 01:24:09.260
INTERPRETER: Then what to do?

01:24:09.260 --> 01:24:11.140
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:24:11.140 --> 01:24:13.090
INTERPRETER: So it
might sound that way.

01:24:13.090 --> 01:24:13.940
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:24:13.940 --> 01:24:15.130
INTERPRETER: But if you
look at it a little deeper--

01:24:15.130 --> 01:24:16.240
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:24:16.240 --> 01:24:18.620
INTERPRETER: --say you feel
this anger rising within you.

01:24:18.620 --> 01:24:21.352
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:24:21.352 --> 01:24:23.310
INTERPRETER: So then you
have only two options.

01:24:23.310 --> 01:24:26.760
To express that anger, or
to suppress that anger.

01:24:26.760 --> 01:24:28.094
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:24:28.094 --> 01:24:30.551
INTERPRETER: But if you go back
to the root of that anger--

01:24:30.551 --> 01:24:31.895
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:24:31.895 --> 01:24:33.311
INTERPRETER: --you
have to observe

01:24:33.311 --> 01:24:35.140
the anger originating
within you.

01:24:35.140 --> 01:24:36.830
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:24:36.830 --> 01:24:40.365
INTERPRETER: So if that
anger never rises--

01:24:40.365 --> 01:24:42.560
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:24:42.560 --> 01:24:44.730
INTERPRETER: --then you
don't have to suppress it,

01:24:44.730 --> 01:24:46.130
nor express it.

01:24:46.130 --> 01:24:47.464
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:24:47.464 --> 01:24:49.004
INTERPRETER: That's
why we ask people

01:24:49.004 --> 01:24:50.390
to go deeper into the roots.

01:24:50.390 --> 01:24:53.286
Ask yourself, why
do I get angry?

01:24:53.286 --> 01:24:55.500
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:24:55.500 --> 01:24:57.950
INTERPRETER: So you
need to delve deeper--

01:24:57.950 --> 01:24:59.790
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:24:59.790 --> 01:25:02.470
INTERPRETER: --and become a
person who is not angered.

01:25:02.470 --> 01:25:06.846
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:25:06.846 --> 01:25:08.220
INTERPRETER: But
we allow ourself

01:25:08.220 --> 01:25:10.730
to sink into a
state of ignorance.

01:25:10.730 --> 01:25:13.470
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:25:13.470 --> 01:25:16.090
INTERPRETER: Because anger
rises from the subconscious

01:25:16.090 --> 01:25:17.120
within us.

01:25:17.120 --> 01:25:19.194
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:25:19.194 --> 01:25:21.110
INTERPRETER: And our
conscious does not always

01:25:21.110 --> 01:25:22.210
catch it in time.

01:25:22.210 --> 01:25:25.425
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:25:25.425 --> 01:25:27.050
INTERPRETER: That's
why we teach people

01:25:27.050 --> 01:25:30.237
for your conscious to
be awake at all times.

01:25:30.237 --> 01:25:31.570
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:25:31.570 --> 01:25:33.420
INTERPRETER: But
sometimes it escapes us.

01:25:33.420 --> 01:25:35.710
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:25:35.710 --> 01:25:38.270
INTERPRETER: So we tell
people to catch your anger,

01:25:38.270 --> 01:25:40.070
be aware of your anger.

01:25:40.070 --> 01:25:46.155
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:25:46.155 --> 01:25:49.670
INTERPRETER: So if you can
catch your anger and observe it,

01:25:49.670 --> 01:25:51.000
it doesn't amplify.

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:53.485
It actually reduces in
volume and disappears.

01:25:53.485 --> 01:25:55.595
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:25:55.595 --> 01:25:57.970
INTERPRETER: So you're not
trying to suppress it, per se.

01:25:57.970 --> 01:26:00.110
You're trying to
become aware of it.

01:26:00.110 --> 01:26:01.510
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:26:01.510 --> 01:26:03.400
INTERPRETER: To be awake to it.

01:26:03.400 --> 01:26:05.210
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:26:05.210 --> 01:26:07.620
INTERPRETER: So you don't
create stress that way.

01:26:07.620 --> 01:26:09.381
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:26:09.381 --> 01:26:11.130
INTERPRETER: But say
you lost that moment.

01:26:11.130 --> 01:26:12.570
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:26:12.570 --> 01:26:14.980
INTERPRETER: Say that you
actually expressed your anger.

01:26:14.980 --> 01:26:18.169
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:26:18.169 --> 01:26:19.960
INTERPRETER: Then we
usually make an excuse

01:26:19.960 --> 01:26:21.800
that it's your fault
that I'm angry.

01:26:21.800 --> 01:26:23.414
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:26:23.414 --> 01:26:25.830
INTERPRETER: At that moment,
you have to look at yourself.

01:26:25.830 --> 01:26:26.770
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:26:26.770 --> 01:26:28.478
INTERPRETER: You say,
I lost that moment.

01:26:28.478 --> 01:26:30.520
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:26:30.520 --> 01:26:33.700
INTERPRETER: And you have
to kind of review yourself.

01:26:33.700 --> 01:26:36.640
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:26:36.640 --> 01:26:38.680
INTERPRETER: Then that
anger is not amplified.

01:26:38.680 --> 01:26:42.087
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:26:42.087 --> 01:26:43.670
INTERPRETER: And
that allows your life

01:26:43.670 --> 01:26:45.770
to become much more comfortable.

01:26:45.770 --> 01:26:50.580
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:26:50.580 --> 01:26:54.040
INTERPRETER: So what I'm
not try to suppress stress.

01:26:54.040 --> 01:26:55.617
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:26:55.617 --> 01:26:57.450
INTERPRETER: Because
you need to resolve it.

01:26:57.450 --> 01:27:02.230
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:27:02.230 --> 01:27:04.260
INTERPRETER: So I think
exploding in anger

01:27:04.260 --> 01:27:05.815
is not a resolution.

01:27:05.815 --> 01:27:08.652
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:27:08.652 --> 01:27:10.485
INTERPRETER: That's why
you have to maintain

01:27:10.485 --> 01:27:13.210
a constant state
of awakefulness.

01:27:13.210 --> 01:27:14.932
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:27:14.932 --> 01:27:16.890
INTERPRETER: And for
that, to reach that state,

01:27:16.890 --> 01:27:17.639
you need practice.

01:27:17.639 --> 01:27:20.530
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:27:20.530 --> 01:27:22.970
INTERPRETER: That's why
meditation is a good practice.

01:27:22.970 --> 01:27:24.707
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:27:24.707 --> 01:27:26.290
INTERPRETER: The
first step is for you

01:27:26.290 --> 01:27:28.200
to recognize, be
awake to your breath.

01:27:28.200 --> 01:27:31.580
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:27:31.580 --> 01:27:34.160
INTERPRETER: And try to
maintain a state of tranquility

01:27:34.160 --> 01:27:35.200
on your mind.

01:27:35.200 --> 01:27:37.649
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:27:37.649 --> 01:27:39.190
INTERPRETER: So of
course it's easier

01:27:39.190 --> 01:27:41.600
to maintain that when
you're sitting down.

01:27:41.600 --> 01:27:43.065
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:27:43.065 --> 01:27:45.190
INTERPRETER: But it's also
difficult to maintain it

01:27:45.190 --> 01:27:47.190
while you're actually
encountering people.

01:27:47.190 --> 01:27:48.810
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:27:48.810 --> 01:27:51.565
INTERPRETER: But just because
you fail, it's not a bad thing.

01:27:51.565 --> 01:27:54.090
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:27:54.090 --> 01:27:56.670
INTERPRETER: Because it allows
you to explore why you failed.

01:27:56.670 --> 01:27:58.070
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:27:58.070 --> 01:28:00.320
INTERPRETER: And then take
that back to your practice.

01:28:00.320 --> 01:28:02.170
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:28:02.170 --> 01:28:04.647
INTERPRETER: Then experiment
with it in real life.

01:28:04.647 --> 01:28:05.980
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:28:05.980 --> 01:28:07.855
INTERPRETER: Then go
back and practice again.

01:28:07.855 --> 01:28:10.060
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:28:10.060 --> 01:28:12.180
INTERPRETER: So if you
put it in that effort--

01:28:12.180 --> 01:28:15.059
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:28:15.059 --> 01:28:17.600
INTERPRETER: --where nothing is
going to completely go away--

01:28:17.600 --> 01:28:19.020
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:28:19.020 --> 01:28:20.590
INTERPRETER: --but
perhaps 80% of it.

01:28:20.590 --> 01:28:22.140
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:28:22.140 --> 01:28:24.880
INTERPRETER: It's very easy to
arrive at a much better state.

01:28:24.880 --> 01:28:27.615
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:28:27.615 --> 01:28:29.490
INTERPRETER: The sense
you are able to create

01:28:29.490 --> 01:28:31.130
much happier lives
for yourselves.

01:28:31.130 --> 01:28:34.142
POMNYUN SUNIM: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

01:28:34.142 --> 01:28:35.850
INTERPRETER: Much more
comfortable lives,

01:28:35.850 --> 01:28:36.507
tranquil lives.

01:28:36.507 --> 01:28:37.840
