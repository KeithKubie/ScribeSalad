00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:03.630
So how would you use the notion of understanding [UNKNOWN] frames, constraint,

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:07.390
and ambiguity to address Raven's progressive matrices? One example of

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:10.390
an application here, would be to the idea of multiple possible transformations,

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:12.290
that we saw in some of our earlier problems.

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:15.000
We saw certain problems that could be solved with either rotation or

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.700
a reflection, but they would give different answers. You might imagine a frame

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:21.800
that dictates certain expected values for different transformations. And

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.050
the degree of fit to those expectations can dictate the accuracy of that

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.480
particular answer. Try to think of the different phases of the understanding

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.550
process. How do you first understand what's happening in the problem?

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:34.975
How do you fit that, into a thematically role frame representation? And

00:00:34.975 --> 00:00:37.900
how would that representation then help you transfer and solve the problem?
