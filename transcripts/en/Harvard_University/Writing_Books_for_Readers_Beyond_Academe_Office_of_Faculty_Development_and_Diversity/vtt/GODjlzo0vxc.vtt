ANGELA VON DER LIPPE:
Thank you, Amy.

00:00:09.526 --> 00:00:14.000
A preliminary disclosure,
I work for the last

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.640
of the independent
publishers, WW Norton,

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:18.850
whose name I think
you'd agree is

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:22.390
synonymous with interests
of the university,

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:24.810
but it wasn't always so.

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.120
As I discovered last week
when my husband handed me

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:31.210
an article from
the January 28th,

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:35.670
1924 edition of the
Harvard Crimson.

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.520
With the headline,
"Lecture halls

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.760
may become the laboratories
for lecture publishers."

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:47.710
With the alarmist subheadings,
"A cultural correspondence

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:52.810
school, " and, "Aristocracy
of brains threatened,"

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:57.580
Sound familiar with all the
talk about cognitive elites?

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:01.740
It was a piece from the founding
of the People's Publishing

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:04.970
institute based on
a series of public

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:09.850
lectures at Cooper Union and the
new school, sponsored by one,

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.150
William Warder Norton,
an upstart publisher

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:18.070
making it his business
to make the university's

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:23.070
business available to the
public through books no less.

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.740
I had no idea I worked for
such a subversive publisher.

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.930
In any case I think that the lab
experiment, for the most part,

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:35.300
worked out in everyone's favor.

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:38.970
So let me turn to the
challenges we face today.

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.160
When I sat down to
write this talk,

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.030
the first thing
that came to mind

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:47.340
was, well, I'll have to
tell them it's a crap shoot.

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.670
And then came the backpedaling,
no, I can't tell them

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.930
that, that's not what
they need to hear.

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:56.370
Still whatever else I tell
you today, keep in mind

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:58.735
the one certainty about
trade publishing--

00:01:58.735 --> 00:02:01.540
it is a crap shoot.

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:05.740
That same afternoon I was
in my car listening to NPR

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:10.070
and I tuned into a conversation
with the biographer, Bob

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:14.400
Richardson, about his
latest collection of essays.

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:19.310
And he was talking about
the cash value of an idea.

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.980
And the term was
jarring, and I winced

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.880
as I realized that it was none
other than William James who

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:30.460
coined the term, his low
lectures on pragmatism,

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:32.930
public ones for which
he got a pretty penny

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:35.820
and probably had kids in school.

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:40.910
But as dissonant is the
phrase, cash value of an idea,

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:45.330
seemed to me, it wasn't
just the commodifying part

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.710
of it felt a little vulgar.

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:49.790
It was maybe that
the question, what

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:54.350
is the cash value of an idea,
struck a little too close

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:55.530
to home.

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.000
To something we
people in publishing,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.450
and all gradations of
publishing, but especially

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:03.740
the trade grapple
with every day.

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:06.430
And however much I tell
myself that the cash

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:09.580
value of an idea isn't
its intrinsic value,

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:12.860
or its whole value,
isn't what I do,

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:15.870
I'm stuck in an
industry like so many,

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:19.110
that looks to the market
to determine value,

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:22.000
and indeed, will make
their publishing choices

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.280
based, in part and
sometimes in large part,

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.780
on a cold calculation.

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:31.980
So I'm not infrequently
torn between two publishing

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:35.260
responsibilities--
the one captured

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.930
in the German word for
publisher [GERMAN],

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:42.170
transferring goods and
money, and the other

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:44.730
in its Latin root, [LATIN].

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:48.170
Getting the word
out-- much more suited

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:50.870
to my impractical nature.

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:55.190
My job is to be a first
reader, to help authors craft

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:57.070
their words and
arguments in a way that

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:00.760
captures the public
imagination for their subject,

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:04.460
reaches out to readers,
delivers the goods.

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:08.590
But I'm also a bookmaker,
dealing in ideas.

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:11.770
And that's what anyone
publishing serious nonfiction

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:13.630
these days is doing.

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:18.300
I'm collecting and making
bets on idea books.

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:21.959
And this is what I want
to briefly address today.

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:25.550
How we all can approach writing
for the trade with an eye

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:29.030
toward beating the
odds of the market.

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:33.740
Let's face it, it's an
industry in tremendous flux

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:38.070
with a few years ago, some
50,000 books published

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:40.600
each year in the US alone.

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:44.640
And that's before you factor
in the exponential increases

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:47.650
in titles through
electronic sales,

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:51.200
and all the other noise
in the marketplace.

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:54.090
As a publisher, it's
a formidable challenge

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:56.020
to get the attention
of the marketplace

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:00.170
out there for your idea book,
your serious nonfiction,

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:04.380
or for that matter, your
book of literary fiction

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:08.610
when it has to compete against
a sea of other books, celebrity

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:12.530
books, sports books, comic
books, murder and mayhem,

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:16.870
redemption, rumor, conspiracy,
especially today when

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:21.190
it is often delivered on the
same device that streams music,

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:24.350
film, and endless games.

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:29.730
Case in point, 30 years
ago Cosmos, the book,

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:36.160
and Cosmos, the TV series
occupied different galaxies.

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:39.610
Today's new Cosmos
will be available

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:44.490
in dual formats and mixed
media instantaneously

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:46.340
on the same device.

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:48.520
So you can bet when
it comes to a choice

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:53.330
to be seen interactively,
or read singularly

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:56.230
which format will prevail.

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:59.650
The book may have to work
harder today to be read.

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:08.050
One of my authors, the
cosmologist, Sir Martin Rees,

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:10.860
has written an eloquent
little book entitled,

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:12.940
From Here To Infinity.

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:16.600
It's based on his Reith
lectures he delivered last year.

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:19.520
And in this book, he
passionately enlist scientists

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:23.580
of every stripe, pure and
applied, to come out of the lab

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:30.140
and in from the field to assert
themselves as global citizens.

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:32.850
"Scientists have a
civic responsibility,"

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:35.410
he says, 'to inform
the public of what

00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:39.910
they do, their process, their
discoveries, their methods.

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:41.000
Why?

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.590
Because never have the
stakes been as high,

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:47.760
the misinformation
been as saturated,

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:52.860
and the power and fate of
the many been as concentrated

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:55.400
in the hands of a
disinterested few,

00:06:55.400 --> 00:07:00.630
valuing political expediency
over scientific truth."

00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:04.350
I was reminded of Rees'
appeal to scientists

00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:10.820
when I read the opening
pages of Marketplace of Ideas

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:14.470
about the role of the university
in today's global world.

00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:18.240
And what resonated
with me from that book

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:20.450
was a basic appeal
to the university

00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:23.930
and its members also, to
get out of themselves, out

00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:28.580
of business as usual, and think
of novel ways of doing its core

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:32.410
business, generating ideas
that shape the culture

00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:37.370
and are the binding elements of
our social fabric, our memory,

00:07:37.370 --> 00:07:38.890
and our vision.

00:07:38.890 --> 00:07:42.980
And what better vehicle
for clarifying those ideas

00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:46.230
and forging that
critical connection

00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:48.900
with the world
than the book, even

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:53.110
in the turbulent world of
technological innovation.

00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:56.180
And that's just to say,
with so much out there

00:07:56.180 --> 00:08:00.540
to distract that public
from critical thinking,

00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:04.630
what we do in publishing
serious nonfiction, in what you

00:08:04.630 --> 00:08:08.420
do in writing it
expressly for the trade,

00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:13.330
may have more of a critical
function today than ever.

00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:17.580
So what do we do to
get their attention?

00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:21.210
When we editors consider
projects that proposal stage,

00:08:21.210 --> 00:08:23.510
and for that matter
later, promoting it

00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:25.810
to critics in the
greater world, we're

00:08:25.810 --> 00:08:29.060
frequently asked what
the take away of a book

00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:32.890
is, what readers will
draw from the argument.

00:08:32.890 --> 00:08:36.230
It's an eye-opening exercise.

00:08:36.230 --> 00:08:38.730
It can be ridiculously
reductive,

00:08:38.730 --> 00:08:40.600
but it's also useful.

00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:43.250
And you may be listening
to these remarks saying,

00:08:43.250 --> 00:08:45.620
what's the takeaway?

00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:50.660
I have to confess, I rarely
publish a prescriptive book,

00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:55.040
hate being told what to
do, and I'm the last person

00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:58.450
to give you seven simple
keys for the academic,

00:08:58.450 --> 00:09:00.550
writing of a
successful trade book.

00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:03.390
But I can't give
you a few pointers.

00:09:03.390 --> 00:09:06.570
A few things to consider
in framing your projects

00:09:06.570 --> 00:09:08.000
for the trade.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.640
I think I know where
you're coming from,

00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:16.060
as I came from
academic publishing,

00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:18.760
right down the street at
Harvard University Press,

00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:21.900
and before that
I'm from academia,

00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:27.010
and easily 2/3 of my
authors come from academia.

00:09:27.010 --> 00:09:31.340
And while I can't deny that
academic writing is often

00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:36.000
code for deadly, dispassionate,
obfuscating prose

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.330
because it can be
just that, it's

00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:41.730
also true that
academic writing can

00:09:41.730 --> 00:09:44.480
convey something very special.

00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:49.260
And that's authority,
nuance, and originality.

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:51.320
It's avoiding the
former and capitalizing

00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:54.970
on the latter that will make the
difference in writing a trade

00:09:54.970 --> 00:09:56.410
book.

00:09:56.410 --> 00:09:59.750
Ideally, you want to capture
the public imagination

00:09:59.750 --> 00:10:02.710
for your subject by delivering
a fresh perspective,

00:10:02.710 --> 00:10:06.930
a new argument, a scientific
horizon, or a story never heard

00:10:06.930 --> 00:10:10.700
before in prose that enlightens
and doesn't speak down

00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:12.080
to people.

00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:13.770
Tall order.

00:10:13.770 --> 00:10:15.890
Journalists, for
the most part, rise

00:10:15.890 --> 00:10:19.880
to this challenge with ease
because they are constantly

00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:23.190
distilling complex
ideas in brief compass

00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:26.100
and pitching their
work to the media.

00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:29.580
But academics have a
difficult time calibrating

00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:33.140
what they know, and the
requirements of scholarship,

00:10:33.140 --> 00:10:36.650
against the needs of a
good persuasive story.

00:10:36.650 --> 00:10:39.940
Here are just a few things
to consider in thinking

00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:43.326
about writing for the trade.

00:10:43.326 --> 00:10:46.590
, One synthesis.

00:10:46.590 --> 00:10:50.800
One of the reasons that people
like Carl Zimmer and Malcolm

00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:55.550
Gladwell and Fareed Zakaria as
such successful trade writers

00:10:55.550 --> 00:10:58.520
is that they are
natural synthesizers.

00:10:58.520 --> 00:11:00.690
Academics who are
naturally invested

00:11:00.690 --> 00:11:03.370
in a specific corner
of research find

00:11:03.370 --> 00:11:07.090
it painful to take a
wide angle approach

00:11:07.090 --> 00:11:08.950
to writing for the trade.

00:11:08.950 --> 00:11:13.600
When Brian Greene's proposal for
a trade book on string theory

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:18.310
came to trade publishers with
the title, Hidden Dimensions,

00:11:18.310 --> 00:11:20.820
and the promise of
an immediate dive

00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:24.360
into a mire of
multiple dimensions,

00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:28.370
the book was rejected by the
trade, except for yours truly.

00:11:28.370 --> 00:11:31.090
And that was probably because
I was fresh from Harvard

00:11:31.090 --> 00:11:33.780
University Press.

00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:39.280
And it was on its way to
be published by Princeton.

00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:40.370
There are worse fates.

00:11:43.094 --> 00:11:46.180
In the end, the
approach was altered

00:11:46.180 --> 00:11:49.130
to a historical
unfolding of space time

00:11:49.130 --> 00:11:51.730
through relativity
and quantum physics,

00:11:51.730 --> 00:11:56.550
culminating in multi-dimensional
space of strings,

00:11:56.550 --> 00:11:58.680
with the title, The
Elegant Universe.

00:11:58.680 --> 00:11:59.980
It caught on.

00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:02.230
It wasn't driven
by his research,

00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:06.560
he wasn't the central
figure in the string worl--

00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:08.730
Ed Witten would have been.

00:12:08.730 --> 00:12:12.960
And given its subject matter, it
certainly wasn't an easy book,

00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:14.810
but it was one
that readers could

00:12:14.810 --> 00:12:18.730
scale by virtue of
the angle of approach

00:12:18.730 --> 00:12:21.560
that Greene had so
deftly provided.

00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:26.130
Synthesis drives some of the
most successful trade books

00:12:26.130 --> 00:12:28.580
by academics, as
I'm sure you know.

00:12:28.580 --> 00:12:31.960
Steve Pinker's first trade
book, The Language Instinct,

00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:34.620
drawing on Chomsky,
and Dan Goldman's,

00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:38.250
Emotional Intelligence, on the
work on social intelligence,

00:12:38.250 --> 00:12:41.360
and Howard Gardner's,
Multiple Intelligences,

00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:45.680
approaching their subjects
with a wide angle vision.

00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:49.110
There is often a lag of many
years between the emergence

00:12:49.110 --> 00:12:52.440
of the research in the
academy and its distillation

00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:53.490
in the trade.

00:12:53.490 --> 00:12:58.080
It's not that there's nothing
new under the trade sun,

00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:01.500
but that trade books take
a while to percolate,

00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:04.960
and are perhaps a better measure
of how ideas and research

00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:07.520
resonate in the culture.

00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:09.650
The second point is passion.

00:13:09.650 --> 00:13:13.630
Writing for the trade also
gives you a unique opportunity

00:13:13.630 --> 00:13:17.940
to express your passion for your
subject in ways that. academic

00:13:17.940 --> 00:13:20.240
writing may frown upon.

00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:23.390
So it's a chance to
write outside the box.

00:13:23.390 --> 00:13:26.030
And it's amazing how
a consistent dose

00:13:26.030 --> 00:13:30.770
of personal feeling can hold
the attention of readers.

00:13:30.770 --> 00:13:35.630
How you accomplish this, which
narrative devices you employ,

00:13:35.630 --> 00:13:37.850
will depend on your story.

00:13:37.850 --> 00:13:40.370
Astronomer Chris
Impey, in a book

00:13:40.370 --> 00:13:42.590
yet to be published,
How It Began,

00:13:42.590 --> 00:13:48.600
may invent a time machine to
take us through lookback time

00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:50.760
to the first three seconds.

00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:54.480
Eric Kandel in his book,
In Search of Memory,

00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:58.920
intersperses personal
biography with the grand story

00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:03.060
of the revolution in our
understanding of memory

00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:06.890
from the theory of
psychoanalysis, the talking

00:14:06.890 --> 00:14:10.770
cure, to cells talking to
each other in neuroscience.

00:14:10.770 --> 00:14:16.000
It worked for Kandel
actually, because Kandel once

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.690
aspired to finding
the id, the ego,

00:14:18.690 --> 00:14:21.290
and the superego in the brain.

00:14:21.290 --> 00:14:24.860
He wanted to be a psychoanalyst,
he started that way.

00:14:24.860 --> 00:14:27.930
That melding of
biography with narrative

00:14:27.930 --> 00:14:29.930
will not work for everyone.

00:14:29.930 --> 00:14:32.200
And Nietzsche was
right when he warned,

00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:37.480
authors need to shut up when
the work begins to speak.

00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:41.240
But you have to find
your own way of bringing

00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:43.480
your passion to your narrative.

00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:46.940
All part of what
Ursula Le Guin notes

00:14:46.940 --> 00:14:51.940
about writing as, ultimately
a connection with the reader.

00:14:51.940 --> 00:14:56.210
That you write a story and
the reader completes it.

00:14:56.210 --> 00:15:01.130
Well truly, if that happens,
that is passion in action.

00:15:01.130 --> 00:15:04.360
The third point is people.

00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:07.420
One way to infuse your
narrative with passion

00:15:07.420 --> 00:15:11.870
is to pepper it with people,
historical or real life

00:15:11.870 --> 00:15:12.670
doesn't matter.

00:15:12.670 --> 00:15:18.070
I'm amazed at how many really
very interesting proposals

00:15:18.070 --> 00:15:21.350
I receive from academics
that are really

00:15:21.350 --> 00:15:25.290
heavy on interpretive
analysis, and can

00:15:25.290 --> 00:15:28.260
be curiously devoid of people.

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:31.070
They have names, but no people.

00:15:31.070 --> 00:15:33.660
Ideas need to be embodied.

00:15:33.660 --> 00:15:36.460
Arguments need to be dramatized.

00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:40.180
And discoveries need to be
felt, as well as explained

00:15:40.180 --> 00:15:41.760
and defended.

00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:44.320
With Brian Greene,
for instance, there

00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:48.160
was no way a trade
book would sustain

00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:52.520
the math necessary to convey
the work of string theory.

00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:57.950
So, as we talked about it,
he told stories at that point

00:15:57.950 --> 00:15:59.180
in the narrative.

00:15:59.180 --> 00:16:02.970
What was it like to make
a collective discovery

00:16:02.970 --> 00:16:05.520
or breakthrough
in string theory.

00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:09.750
It wasn't graveyard duty at the
Smithsonian, so what was it?

00:16:09.750 --> 00:16:10.700
He told his story.

00:16:10.700 --> 00:16:12.840
It was very effective.

00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:16.960
There's no more compelling
way to present an argument

00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:21.750
than to embody it in
people and context.

00:16:21.750 --> 00:16:25.770
The fourth and last
point is audience.

00:16:25.770 --> 00:16:27.280
Who are you writing for?

00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:29.860
I should have begun with this
because if you get that right,

00:16:29.860 --> 00:16:32.650
other things will start
falling into place.

00:16:32.650 --> 00:16:35.890
If you're writing expressly
for your colleagues,

00:16:35.890 --> 00:16:39.480
then it truly is not
at all in your interest

00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:42.390
to push a book out
into the trade.

00:16:42.390 --> 00:16:47.290
It will be lost or ignored and
won't give the book its due.

00:16:47.290 --> 00:16:49.450
Journals are there
for the short form

00:16:49.450 --> 00:16:52.550
and university
presses are far better

00:16:52.550 --> 00:16:57.150
equipped to get the word out
in book form to professionals.

00:16:57.150 --> 00:16:59.450
To reach the trade
reader, you have

00:16:59.450 --> 00:17:02.750
to think of your
audience as intelligent,

00:17:02.750 --> 00:17:05.550
lay readers for whom
you are opening up

00:17:05.550 --> 00:17:09.160
a subject for
discussion requiring

00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:14.680
no assumed knowledge-- so, your
colleague in other departments.

00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:16.400
Finally, I want
to say a few words

00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:19.560
to the state of trade
publishing-- the trade

00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:23.220
publishing industry which has
been on death's door for 30

00:17:23.220 --> 00:17:25.050
years now.

00:17:25.050 --> 00:17:28.550
There are tremendous changes
that are taking place,

00:17:28.550 --> 00:17:33.080
and we don't know what will
shake out for publishers.

00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:37.220
I heard somewhere publishers
today described as scribes

00:17:37.220 --> 00:17:38.990
before Gutenberg.

00:17:38.990 --> 00:17:43.350
And I said, because I don't
want to believe that, no, no.

00:17:43.350 --> 00:17:47.490
Gutenberg changed literacy,
created a symbolic world,

00:17:47.490 --> 00:17:50.770
this isn't that.

00:17:50.770 --> 00:17:53.780
Last October I was in
Germany, but didn't

00:17:53.780 --> 00:17:55.890
go to the Frankfurt Book Fair.

00:17:55.890 --> 00:17:58.720
I went on a personal
vigil instead,

00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:02.400
to Gottingen to visit
the literary archive

00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:04.230
for the first time,
of a woman I'd

00:18:04.230 --> 00:18:08.570
written two books on-- a
novel, and a work of nonfiction

00:18:08.570 --> 00:18:10.840
on Lou Andreas Salome.

00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:14.040
And when I arrived,
I actually sat

00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:20.030
in a small room with her books
by Rilke, Nietzsche, and Freud,

00:18:20.030 --> 00:18:23.620
and they were
crumbling in my hands.

00:18:23.620 --> 00:18:26.710
And on the way
back to Frankfurt,

00:18:26.710 --> 00:18:31.880
I was left thinking about
the afterlife of words

00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:36.360
held in the palms of a
book for so many centuries.

00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:38.510
And later that evening,
I asked my husband,

00:18:38.510 --> 00:18:42.950
returning from the fair, if
there were any books there.

00:18:42.950 --> 00:18:46.340
And happily there were still.

00:18:46.340 --> 00:18:51.650
A couple of years ago the NBA
award winner, Patti Smith,

00:18:51.650 --> 00:18:57.090
and one of Betsy's clients,
made a moving appeal

00:18:57.090 --> 00:19:00.870
to not completely abandon
the physical book.

00:19:00.870 --> 00:19:06.320
And what I drew from this was
that raw, sensual connection

00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:09.520
to ideas that only books afford.

00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:13.730
And I found it heartening
that this year the NBA

00:19:13.730 --> 00:19:17.410
award for nonfiction
was awarded to a book

00:19:17.410 --> 00:19:22.870
about rescuing a manuscript
from 1,000 years of oblivion.

00:19:22.870 --> 00:19:27.380
A book of dangerous ideas,
Lucretius, On The Nature

00:19:27.380 --> 00:19:28.130
Of Things.

00:19:28.130 --> 00:19:30.890
If you have not
read this, read it

00:19:30.890 --> 00:19:33.780
it's quite and
extraordinary book.

00:19:33.780 --> 00:19:37.040
Copying and translating
it, and changing

00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:39.550
the course of civilization.

00:19:39.550 --> 00:19:42.920
The book about the book was, of
course, Stephen Greenblatt's,

00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:44.450
The Swerve.

00:19:44.450 --> 00:19:48.170
I take that as an altogether
good sign for books,

00:19:48.170 --> 00:19:51.530
and especially for
books of ideas, the ones

00:19:51.530 --> 00:19:54.980
you need to write and
we need to publish.

00:19:54.980 --> 00:19:56.380
Thank you.

00:19:56.380 --> 00:19:59.730
[APPLAUSE]
