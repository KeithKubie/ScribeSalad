00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:05.059
Hi, I’m Andre Meadows, this is Crash Course Games,
and today we’re going to get down to business.

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:07.360
Specifically, the business of video games.

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:12.520
Until the 1970s, computer and video games
were created by individuals with access to expensive,

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:16.600
difficult to use computers that were frequently
housed in institutions like universities.

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:21.080
The general public wasn’t playing video games, and the number of people making games was miniscule.

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:26.360
But there was a community of students and academics who did play early video games on university computers,

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.310
and some of them envisioned a world where
video games could reach a wide audience,

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:32.449
and at the same time be very, very profitable.

00:00:32.449 --> 00:00:36.989
Now, if you’ve seen any of our Crash Course
History series, you know we usually don’t

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.879
go in for so-called “great man” history.

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:44.889
The idea that individuals can shift the course
of history is, in most cases, false.

00:00:44.889 --> 00:00:51.509
But, in the case of Video Game history, a guy named Nolan Bushnell really did manage to change everything.

00:00:51.509 --> 00:01:00.189
[Theme Music]

00:01:00.189 --> 00:01:05.940
Nolan Bushnell got interested in computers in the 1960s while he was a student at the University of Utah.

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:09.260
The school was an important center of computer
graphics research at the time,

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:16.040
and while Bushnell was there, he came across a PDP-1 that played Steve “Slug” Russell’s Spacewar! (exclamation point)

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.600
Bushnell loved the game, and he loved working
with the computers that ran the game.

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:25.740
He played Spacewar! a lot so he could learn all he could about computers and programming languages.

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.880
Incidentally, Bushnell also worked as a barker
on the midway at an amusement park,

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.840
where his job was to convince people to spend their money on playing games like the ring toss.

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.100
It was his amusement park experience
coupled with his knowledge of technology

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.080
that helped him birth an industry.

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:43.380
After college he created a prototype for his
own game called Computer Space,

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:48.500
which shared a lot of gameplay similarities with our old favorite, Spacewar! (exclamation point)

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:53.340
Bushnell partnered with Nutting &amp; Associates, a company that manufactured coin operated bar trivia games,

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.420
to produce a commercial version of Computer Space.
It didn’t go that great.

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.780
Although they put the game in an amazing looking
space age fiberglass cabinet,

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.509
they only only sold around 1000 copies of
the game.

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:10.229
That’s less copies than Wii music. If you
don’t know what Wii Music is, my point exactly.

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:15.320
Bushnell squarely blamed Computer Space’s failure on Nutting &amp; Associated, and decided to form his own company.

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:20.640
He and a partner came up with the princely
sum of $500, and after trying out the name

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.100
Syzygy. Syzygy? Syzygy?

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.830
It has the distinction of being hard to pronounce
AND spell.

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:29.880
He named the company Atari instead.
Thank goodness.

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.600
They took the name from the ancient Japanese
strategy game, Go.

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:37.690
Apparently, the word Atari refers to a situation
where one player’s piece is in danger of

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:39.470
being captured on the next turn.

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:43.810
Some players would speak the word aloud at this point, kind of like saying “check” during a chess game.

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:48.010
It turns out though, actually saying Atari
during a game is considered kind of rude,

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:52.790
and something an inexperienced player would do;
something that would be frowned on by the 'real' players.

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:55.040
How rude.
That’s kind of fitting, though.

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:00.240
As we’ll see here in a minute, Nolan Bushnell’s Atari was definitely a newcomer in the entertainment industry,

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:04.820
and he wasn’t above being rude, and disrupting
the traditional players in the game.

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:08.520
Atari moved into a small warehouse, and hired
a handful of employees.

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:12.480
One of these employees would turn out to be
a crucial early asset to the company.

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.800
Let’s go to the Thought Bubble.
Al Alcorn was an early hire.

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.240
He was a computer scientist and mechanical
engineer,

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:21.070
and Bushnell tasked him with creating Atari’s
first game.

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:23.930
While Bushnell was enthusiastic about computers
and electronics,

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:27.320
he needed someone with more engineering experience
to design the games.

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:31.140
Bushnell assigned Alcorn to create a table
tennis simulation, and in a week and a half,

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:34.410
Alcorn delivered a hand-wired version of the
game that became Pong.

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:38.720
The game was rough and incomplete and seemingly
built with stuff from around the house.

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.660
The onscreen white bars that represented players’
paddles were placeholders,

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:44.790
intended to be replaced with fancy graphics
that looked like human players.

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:48.810
The cabinet was cobbled together out of spare
parts, with an off the shelf TV for a monitor,

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:50.730
and a bread pan to collect the quarters.

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:55.580
Bushnell, foreshadowing a habit of rushing products to market, thought all those half-measures were just fine,

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:59.780
and they installed the game in a local bar
for playtesting. It was an immediate success.

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:05.260
According to video game historian David Ellis, the bar started attracting patrons who only wanted to play Pong.

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:09.210
The game was so popular that at one point
the prototype machine stopped working because

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:10.970
there were too many quarters in the bread
pan.

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:15.920
Atari moved Pong into mass production, and despite some manufacturing hiccups, the game was a success.

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:18.030
But Atari’s success bred competition.

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:22.620
Within a year of Pong’s release other major gaming companies in the US began making knock-offs of it.

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:27.360
Companies that had built their businesses on carnival games and electro mechanical games like pinball machines,

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:31.240
and that dumb skill claw game, suddenly jumped
into the video game business.

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:36.450
Williams had Paddle Ball, Chicago Coin had
Olympic TV Hockey, Sega had Hockey TV,

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:39.730
Taito had Pro Hockey, and Brunswick had Astro
Hockey.

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:43.930
All of these looked and played like Pong,
and these clones cut into Atari’s business.

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:46.140
Thanks, Thought Bubble.
So how did this happen?

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:51.730
Well, according to video game historian Steven Kent, the company failed to apply for patents before releasing the game,

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:54.700
which allowed competitors to enter the market
with very similar games.

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:59.420
In addition to stiff competition, Atari ran into trouble with distributors of coin-operated games.

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:03.940
At the time, the industry was controlled only a handful of game distributors in each region of the country,

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:08.600
and each of these distributors wanted an exclusive
contract to sell Atari products in their area.

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:13.480
Bushnell wanted to sell games to all the distributors, but Atari had already signed a bunch of these contracts.

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:18.120
So, in a move that some might see unethical,
he hired his neighbor to run a new company,

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:21.460
Kee Games, which produced clones of Atari
games with different names.

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:26.240
This allowed Bushnell to sell Atari game machines
to one distributor and Kee games to another,

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:28.840
increasing sales without violating his contracts.

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:33.740
Eventually this deception was found out, but luckily, by that time Atari’s games were so popular,

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:37.870
and generated so much money for distributors
that they overlooked the contract violations.

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:41.280
This was the beginning of the end for the
exclusive distribution contract,

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:45.560
and it paved the way for Arcade games to become
national hits, rather than regional phenomena.

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:50.980
For much of the 1970’s, Atari continued to produce hit after hit for the coin-operated game industry.

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:55.080
In 1974 they created Gotcha, an early maze
game like Pac-man.

00:05:55.090 --> 00:06:02.030
And Atari struck gold in 1976 with a variant of
Pong called Breakout. OK. It’s time to LEVEL UP.

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:04.270
So this is Breakout which is really cool to
play.

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:06.660
Hopefully, I’m better at this than I was
at Spacewar!

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:12.320
As you can see this is the Atari 2600 home
version of Breakout not the arcade version.

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:17.180
And I’m playing it on a Ouya controller so if I don’t do well I’m going to blame the controller.

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:20.570
I would be much better if I had the Atari
controller in my hand. Let’s go with that.

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:26.140
Alright here we go, so you have a paddle at
the bottom and eventually you will start the game.

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:31.380
And when you start the game a little ball or block
comes down. Oh, and I already missed it.

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:34.440
Now what’s interesting about this game is
the story behind it.

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:39.440
You see Nolan Bushnell asked an employee to specifically make this game,

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:43.900
that employee that he asked, was this guy, you might have heard of him, his name is Steve Jobs.

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:48.440
So Steve actually asked his friend, to help
him do this game.

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:52.780
His friend being Steve Wozniak - some good
company to have.

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:57.760
Wozniak actually finished making the game
in four days. They called it the Four Day Wonder.

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:02.120
It’s going to take me four days to hit one
of these balls.

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:05.500
Breakout actually influenced other game designers
like Tomohiro Nishikado,

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:09.680
the creator of Space Invaders, he said he wouldn’t have made that game if it wasn’t for Breakout.

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:15.320
Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak went on to make
this little company called Apple in 1976,

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:22.280
and Steve Wozniak has even said that his designs and influence on the Apple II came from working on Breakout.

00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:29.940
So, you have this little bouncing ball, rainbow
breaking game to thank for the Apple Company,

00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:32.240
the Apple II, and the vision of Wozniak.

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:35.500
Alright, I think I’m done with Breakout.
I did the best I could with it.

00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:37.730
I really recommend playing this game.

00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:42.730
It’s a fun game but play the arcade or play
it with an old school Atari controller.

00:07:42.730 --> 00:07:45.410
To really get the feel of how it was to play
this game back in the 70’s.

00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:49.640
Now, if Atari’s pioneering commercialization
of video games was the company’s only contribution

00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:52.980
to the history of video games, we might have
still done a whole episode on it.

00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:57.800
But Atari was also vital to the other major
change video games underwent in the 1970’s.

00:07:57.820 --> 00:08:03.060
Atari’s next step toward dominating the hearts
and wallets of consumers was a home invasion.

00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:06.139
They started making video games people could
play at home.

00:08:06.139 --> 00:08:10.510
After Pong’s initial arcade success, Atari
produced a home version of the game that consumers

00:08:10.510 --> 00:08:12.120
could play on their home televisions.

00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:15.600
They sold these games through Sears, and they
sold a lot of them.

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:19.010
It became clear that the gaming frontier was
in consumers’ living rooms.

00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:25.919
In 1977 Atari released the Atari 2600 in all
its simulated wood-grain glory.

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:28.919
The console didn’t see immediate success,
largely due to it’s high price

00:08:28.919 --> 00:08:34.179
-- $199 that’s about $777 when you
adjust it for inflation --

00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:37.620
and the fact that there were only about 10
games available at launch.

00:08:37.629 --> 00:08:41.380
But technologically, the Atari 2600 was miles
ahead of the competition.

00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:45.339
While there were other home video consoles
on the market that had a few games built in,

00:08:45.339 --> 00:08:49.299
Atari’s real innovation with the 2600 was
the interchangeable game cartridge.

00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:54.840
Interchangeable games meant that players could buy and play new games without replacing the entire console.

00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:57.579
And that meant lots of cartridge sales for
Atari.

00:08:57.579 --> 00:09:01.889
This move into the home made games more accessible
and a larger part of our everyday life.

00:09:01.889 --> 00:09:06.490
The success of the Atari 2600 spawned the
console wars of the second part of the 1970’s

00:09:06.490 --> 00:09:08.420
and wormed its way into the popular culture.

00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:13.660
You can see the Atari 2600 in movies, like
Airplane, Blade Runner, and of course E.T.

00:09:13.660 --> 00:09:15.440
But we’ll get to that later.

00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:19.520
The company would continue to dominate the
industry throughout the 70’s and into the 80’s,

00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:25.480
creating classics like Centipede, Tempest, and Pitfall until the great video game crash of the 1980’s.

00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:29.860
Atari isn’t dead, the company continues
on today, and still produces games.

00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:33.819
But Nolan Bushnell is no longer involved,
and it isn’t anything like the innovative,

00:09:33.819 --> 00:09:37.239
disruptive, and for a while, dominant force
that it once was.

00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:42.040
Thanks for watching, I’ll see you next week,
and just one more time - ATARI!

00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:46.220
