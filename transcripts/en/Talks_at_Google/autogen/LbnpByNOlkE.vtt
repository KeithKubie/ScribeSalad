SPEAKER 1: Well,
welcome, everyone.

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:06.340
Thank you for being here.

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:10.290
Excited to take some time today
to talk about this new book

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.020
and to introduce you to the
author and my friend Amy

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:15.280
Carroll.

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:17.530
She's the author of the book
"The China Factor," which

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:19.350
we'll talk about today.

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.070
For those of you who
haven't read it yet,

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:24.200
it's been endorsed
by Harvard, Stanford,

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.720
and the forward is written by
the chairman of the Silicon

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.340
Valley Bank.

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:34.104
She and the book were recently
quoted in a "Forbes" article,

00:00:34.104 --> 00:00:35.520
for those of you
in the room which

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.490
is at the back, that talked
about Hillary and Donald,

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:44.480
for those of you here in the
US and how this topic that she

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.620
talks about is actually the one
common factor between the two

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:48.287
of them.

00:00:48.287 --> 00:00:50.620
So if you have a chance to
read that article, please do.

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:51.570
Well, let's get started.

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:51.750
Welcome.

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.125
AMY KARAM: Thanks,
Suzanne, yeah.

00:00:53.125 --> 00:00:54.300
I'm happy to be here

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.680
SPEAKER 1: So for
those of us that

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:58.819
haven't deep dived
the book, tell us

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:59.860
about "The China Factor."

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:00.720
What's it about?

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:02.970
AMY KARAM: All right, but
before we get into the book,

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:05.000
I just wanted to take a survey.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.290
How many of you have
either worked in or with

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:10.600
or for emerging markets?

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.300
Anybody familiar
with-- raise your hand.

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:14.590
OK, great, we've
got a small handful.

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:15.520
All right, super.

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.770
And I just wanted
to set the stage.

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:19.520
I'd love for this
to be interactive,

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.170
so if you have
comments, I would love

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:24.110
to hear from you, questions.

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:26.440
And just let's make
this a learning thing

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.680
all across the board.

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.900
So about "The China Factor,"
what I wanted to start off with

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:36.060
is what it's not
about, necessarily.

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.290
So it's not about how
to do business in China,

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:41.440
although it would
be useful for you

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:45.420
if you were to use
it for that purpose.

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.590
But what it is, the
main intention of it,

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.510
is to equip
Western-based companies

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:55.480
with strategies and
tactics and knowledge

00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:00.460
in better competing with
emerging entrants like those

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:01.890
from China.

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.760
So China has risen.

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:05.280
They're doing a great job.

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.180
They're a strong
force in our economy.

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:10.979
And they do business
differently.

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.240
And the premise is that we
as Western-based companies

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.230
need to change our
game a little bit.

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:21.100
We need to know that
emerging competitors have

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.280
different approaches,
and we need

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.050
to be more creative about that.

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:29.980
The other element is the
innovation advantage.

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:33.430
And how do we protect
or maintain and evolve

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:36.480
our innovation advantage?

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.600
And that's a big element
in the book, too.

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.880
So we take a look at
some innovation models

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.260
and how we can be innovating
maybe a little bit differently

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.840
or learning from each other
in terms of innovation.

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.290
So the book starts out with
a little synopsis of what

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:54.840
really has happened, right?

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.429
How did China become so strong?

00:02:57.429 --> 00:02:58.970
What are the strengths
and weaknesses

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:02.730
of each side, the
West and the East?

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.820
And then we get
into a comparison

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:08.620
using the five-part framework.

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:12.460
This is how China and/or
emerging competitors,

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:13.770
how they do business.

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:17.530
And then ultimately, how
can Western-based companies

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.730
do business differently using
that five-part framework?

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:23.649
And then we close with
some detailed case studies

00:03:23.649 --> 00:03:25.940
just to give you an idea of
how all these elements come

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:26.510
together.

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:27.760
SPEAKER 1: Thank you for that.

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.816
And so share with the audience
what this is based on.

00:03:31.816 --> 00:03:33.190
Where did the
research come from?

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:34.050
What does that look like?

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:35.049
AMY KARAM: Oh, yeah, OK.

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:40.620
So I worked at Cisco for over
10 years, and a good part

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.950
of those years, about
four of those years,

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:47.180
I led a competitive
sales support

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:49.840
program that was sponsored
by the CEO at the time.

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:54.330
So the fun part was Cisco
was going to emerging

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:55.480
markets in a big way.

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.440
They said emerging
markets was important.

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:02.020
And also emerging competitors
were becoming a stronger force

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:03.500
and challenging us.

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:05.670
And so we created this program.

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:07.820
I was the global
escalation point.

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:10.670
And so the sales people
from around the world

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:12.990
would tell me about
their strategic deals

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:17.470
that they couldn't deal with
on their own regionally that

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:21.600
had to do with competitors
specifically from China.

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.730
And then the other
part of the job

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:28.230
was that I was to report from
a competitive intelligence

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:31.370
perspective back to
executive management saying,

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:33.360
hey, this is what's
happening in the field.

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:36.070
This is what we need
to be more successful.

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:38.270
This is how we need
to change or what

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:43.770
resources we need to bring
to bear in order for us

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:46.780
to be more successful in
this new global environment.

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:50.420
And so the results
were eye-opening.

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:53.090
It was just like, wow, this
isn't business as usual.

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:56.150
It's not like some of
our domestic competitors.

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:59.930
It's not a product
superiority play anymore.

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:02.680
Here it's like, my box
is better than your box,

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:04.160
so I'll win the business.

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.790
And that's not what was
happening, especially

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:09.450
in emerging markets and
especially with some

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:10.380
emerging competitors.

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:13.390
So that was the
catalyst for me to say,

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:16.100
wow, this is not a trend,
this is not a blip.

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:18.260
This is, I think, here to stay.

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.200
And I wanted to
share my learnings

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:24.000
with other
Western-based companies.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.040
SPEAKER 1: I know it's not just
based on your time in Cisco,

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:27.620
though.

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:28.360
AMY KARAM: Yes, thank you.

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:29.026
So you're right.

00:05:29.026 --> 00:05:30.340
So that was the catalyst.

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:34.050
And then I left Cisco, and
I did a lot of research,

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:37.510
and it's based on a lot of
other companies as well.

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:39.170
You'll notice at
the end even there's

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:43.400
a case study of Xiaomi, which
is a China-based smartphone

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:47.780
company; Pinnacle Engines,
which was a startup who actually

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:50.220
developed their products
just for emerging markets;

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:52.170
and other companies,
like we talk about Apple,

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:54.250
we talk about HP, we
talk about Intuit.

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:56.320
And it's also other
industries as well.

00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:00.640
So I've tried to pepper it
in with other data points

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:01.930
as well for sure.

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:03.540
SPEAKER 1: So you
just talked about

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:07.289
some eye-opening surprises in
some of your work as a thread.

00:06:07.289 --> 00:06:09.580
Do you want to give some
examples of those, maybe share

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:10.210
a couple?

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:10.880
AMY KARAM: Sure.

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:11.380
Sure.

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:14.850
So first it is the
severe price discounting.

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:16.400
And that's no shocker, right?

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:22.600
Most of us know that that's
generally a pretty consistent

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:24.360
market-penetration strategy.

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:27.100
But there was really
no bottom to it.

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:30.540
So I encountered a
lot of escalations

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:32.340
where they'd say,
hey, my competitor

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:37.070
has just discounted
me by another 25%.

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:40.370
I need I need approval
for another discount.

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:42.980
And so we realized
that that wasn't

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:46.377
going to be a successful
strategy for either competitor

00:06:46.377 --> 00:06:47.460
and even for the customer.

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:48.501
It wasn't a winning game.

00:06:48.501 --> 00:06:50.490
So that was one big thread.

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:53.090
The other was financing,
which we didn't really

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:55.960
get into very much as a
Western-based company.

00:06:55.960 --> 00:07:01.880
And that's a real helpful
tool for emerging customers.

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:06.460
So this competitor
would help them

00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:08.950
with financing and to an
extreme degree, right?

00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:11.370
Sometimes they
would help finance

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:12.880
over a very long period of time.

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:15.830
And that was a real great
value to these emerging markets

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:16.640
customers.

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:20.490
And then another huge trend,
a huge element that came up

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:23.960
was politics, the use
of politics to influence

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:24.880
business decisions.

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:26.209
And we're like, whoa.

00:07:26.209 --> 00:07:27.250
Where did that come from?

00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:28.930
Like what do we do about that?

00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:31.690
It would get
escalated, complaints

00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:33.440
from emerging
markets, like we've

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:36.520
been working this deal for two
years, we had it in the bag,

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:40.670
and the 11th hour they just said
it was an influence from above.

00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:42.690
We have no idea where
it came from, right?

00:07:42.690 --> 00:07:44.250
And it was
government-to-government

00:07:44.250 --> 00:07:46.280
influencing for
business decisions

00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:48.379
at a more granular level.

00:07:48.379 --> 00:07:49.920
SPEAKER 1: So politics
is interesting

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:52.430
and something that
Google obviously

00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:56.030
has had some experience
with as well.

00:07:56.030 --> 00:07:57.840
So do you want to
talk a little bit more

00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:00.560
about some of the
practical things

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:03.750
that you have to think about
and actually do for success?

00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:05.140
AMY KARAM: Yeah, sure.

00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:09.680
So politics is a huge element
of the whole strategy.

00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:12.590
And so because it was
so important in the way

00:08:12.590 --> 00:08:14.920
we had to re-vector
our strategy--

00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:18.770
so another part of my job was to
train the sales teams worldwide

00:08:18.770 --> 00:08:22.610
on how to position vis-a-vis
certain types of competitors.

00:08:22.610 --> 00:08:27.550
And so in the book I outline
a five-part framework,

00:08:27.550 --> 00:08:30.980
as I mentioned, and I
added-- for those of you

00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:33.590
who are business geeks, four
Ps of marketing-- Product,

00:08:33.590 --> 00:08:35.780
Price, Place, Promotion.

00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:38.520
So I created the fifth
P, which is politics.

00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:41.690
So I had the five Ps of
global marketing framework.

00:08:41.690 --> 00:08:46.780
And politics, so back to your
specific question, it does.

00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:50.090
It happens at a
high level, and you

00:08:50.090 --> 00:08:53.890
have your executive management
making pretty big decisions

00:08:53.890 --> 00:08:55.490
in terms of market access.

00:08:55.490 --> 00:08:58.740
So because this has
become such a big world

00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:02.990
but small at the same time,
we need market access.

00:09:02.990 --> 00:09:06.830
We want to play in other
people's sandboxes, as I say.

00:09:06.830 --> 00:09:09.810
But there are certain rules and
there are certain limitations

00:09:09.810 --> 00:09:11.240
that we need to encounter.

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:16.025
And you folks know better than I
when Google pulled out of China

00:09:16.025 --> 00:09:19.840
in 2010 for censorship
reasons, et cetera,

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:21.160
that was a big decision.

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:25.790
And the implications were huge.

00:09:25.790 --> 00:09:28.880
You could have affected
maybe like 1.4,

00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:32.390
1.5 billion people in terms
of access to knowledge.

00:09:32.390 --> 00:09:34.910
But there were
really good reasons,

00:09:34.910 --> 00:09:38.450
and those were the
boundaries within which

00:09:38.450 --> 00:09:41.760
a Western-based company
decided that they did not

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:42.770
want to operate.

00:09:42.770 --> 00:09:46.740
However, recent headlines is
they're going back in, right?

00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:49.860
So market access is
really important,

00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:51.770
and reach is really important.

00:09:51.770 --> 00:09:55.710
So the political element is
knowing that co-opetition

00:09:55.710 --> 00:09:57.820
is the new element.

00:09:57.820 --> 00:10:00.720
It's not that new, but
it's an integral part

00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:02.820
of a strategy going forward.

00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:05.280
It's not us versus them.

00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:07.440
I call it "thus" a
little bit, right?

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:08.890
You combine the two words.

00:10:08.890 --> 00:10:15.910
It's how do we all play together
within our own boundaries

00:10:15.910 --> 00:10:20.980
and desirables to get ultimately
the success that we need.

00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:23.140
So that's it at a high level.

00:10:23.140 --> 00:10:27.270
And then how do you, how
do we at the working level

00:10:27.270 --> 00:10:28.340
deal with politics?

00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:31.840
And politics even happens at
the organizational level, right?

00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:35.400
And generally, there's a
pretty negative connotation

00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:37.160
to politics.

00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:39.020
But what I'm trying
to say in the book is

00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:41.160
it's really important, we
can't ignore it anymore,

00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:43.480
and we need to embrace
it and apply it.

00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:45.810
So how do we apply it
from a sales perspective?

00:10:45.810 --> 00:10:50.640
What we did was we educated
the sales teams on some

00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:54.930
of the tools available from
the US government, for example,

00:10:54.930 --> 00:10:59.990
and the local governments
in different countries.

00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:03.010
How can they engage with
their own government

00:11:03.010 --> 00:11:05.670
to help influence their
own sales locally?

00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:07.890
So reaching out to
the consulates--

00:11:07.890 --> 00:11:08.890
how do you get involved?

00:11:08.890 --> 00:11:11.700
How do you know that some
of these deal opportunities

00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:13.880
are happening early
on in the game?

00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:18.020
How do you escalate some
maybe unfair trade issues

00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:21.230
that you're experiencing so that
there's maybe some intervention

00:11:21.230 --> 00:11:22.290
sooner than later?

00:11:22.290 --> 00:11:24.760
And it's not at the 11th
hour when we oftentimes

00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:25.920
hear about it

00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:29.390
And then we also
organizationally changed.

00:11:29.390 --> 00:11:31.950
And we're able to
convince the senior vice

00:11:31.950 --> 00:11:34.300
president of government
affairs to shift

00:11:34.300 --> 00:11:39.780
the focus from just a policy
perspective to helping

00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:41.800
with sales objectives.

00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:43.440
So using that
influence that they

00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:46.480
have in the government
affairs group for more

00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:51.160
of the end result in terms of
numbers and not just policy.

00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:53.780
And that was really
effective, too.

00:11:53.780 --> 00:11:55.800
We went to
Washington, DC, and we

00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:57.770
escalated some of our concerns.

00:11:57.770 --> 00:11:59.570
So there's a lot we can do.

00:11:59.570 --> 00:12:02.780
And I think it's
really the point

00:12:02.780 --> 00:12:04.190
of learning from each other.

00:12:04.190 --> 00:12:05.960
It's, OK, this is the situation.

00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:09.650
How can you mirror and then
tap into your own resources?

00:12:09.650 --> 00:12:12.189
SPEAKER 1: You use some
great examples in the book.

00:12:12.189 --> 00:12:14.230
I think it would be
interesting for this audience

00:12:14.230 --> 00:12:17.790
to hear your perspective on how
Western-based companies could

00:12:17.790 --> 00:12:21.350
potentially evolve or
change things to think

00:12:21.350 --> 00:12:22.424
about doing differently.

00:12:22.424 --> 00:12:23.090
AMY KARAM: Yeah.

00:12:23.090 --> 00:12:25.010
So there's a list.

00:12:25.010 --> 00:12:26.970
Of course, we all love lists.

00:12:26.970 --> 00:12:30.870
And there's a list of 13 things,
recommendations that we can do.

00:12:30.870 --> 00:12:33.460
And ironically it
ended up on chapter 13.

00:12:33.460 --> 00:12:38.300
So I think that's a really good
luck thing for some cultures,

00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:40.980
mine maybe.

00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:43.995
So very simply, go global.

00:12:43.995 --> 00:12:48.490
A lot of times, Western-based
companies had been hesitant.

00:12:48.490 --> 00:12:49.600
And I don't mean Google.

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:51.520
Let's just set it straight.

00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:54.130
There's a lot of companies
that have already gone global

00:12:54.130 --> 00:12:55.260
and get the global thing.

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:56.670
But I'm just generalizing here.

00:12:56.670 --> 00:12:59.970
It's don't be afraid to
go global if we need to.

00:12:59.970 --> 00:13:02.490
The second part is, OK,
while you're out there,

00:13:02.490 --> 00:13:06.050
let's move out of emerging
markets being a novelty.

00:13:06.050 --> 00:13:07.970
And I think a lot of
Western-based companies

00:13:07.970 --> 00:13:09.260
dabble in emerging markets.

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:10.385
Oh, yeah, it's really cool.

00:13:10.385 --> 00:13:11.390
Let's try it out.

00:13:11.390 --> 00:13:14.920
Let's throw a few people in
there and hope it works out.

00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:16.720
Oh, not making the
ROI that we need.

00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:18.280
Gotta pull out, right?

00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:21.030
It needs to be a
longer-term investment.

00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:22.380
It needs to be a commitment.

00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:26.510
And you need to know that it's
not just a temporary thing.

00:13:26.510 --> 00:13:28.480
Other things like
product development--

00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:30.510
make sure that your
product development

00:13:30.510 --> 00:13:34.070
is catering or customizing
to local customer needs.

00:13:34.070 --> 00:13:35.180
We can't just recycle.

00:13:35.180 --> 00:13:37.824
It's not, oh, this is a
mature product in this market;

00:13:37.824 --> 00:13:39.240
let's just throw
it over the fence

00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:41.170
and see if they're going
to like our old product.

00:13:41.170 --> 00:13:42.586
SPEAKER 1: You had
a great example

00:13:42.586 --> 00:13:44.830
that we talked about
recently on that in something

00:13:44.830 --> 00:13:47.741
that you were working with with
Cisco when they were bringing

00:13:47.741 --> 00:13:48.490
product to market.

00:13:48.490 --> 00:13:49.590
Do you remember what
we talked about?

00:13:49.590 --> 00:13:50.510
AMY KARAM: Oh, yes.

00:13:50.510 --> 00:13:53.100
Yeah.

00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:54.800
And yeah, that's
the other challenge

00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:58.990
with really successful,
innovative companies

00:13:58.990 --> 00:14:02.070
who have a
premium-based product is

00:14:02.070 --> 00:14:05.470
we're really proud of our
innovations and our products.

00:14:05.470 --> 00:14:09.510
And I was hosting some ministers
from an African country,

00:14:09.510 --> 00:14:15.090
and they nicely, politely
sat through the presentation

00:14:15.090 --> 00:14:16.920
at the executive
briefing center.

00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:21.160
And we were talking about how
great our super core router was

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:23.150
and all the features
and functionality,

00:14:23.150 --> 00:14:25.480
and it's the best out there.

00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:29.710
And then at the end, they
asked a question politely,

00:14:29.710 --> 00:14:31.430
thank you for the presentation.

00:14:31.430 --> 00:14:37.084
And how does your product
deal with power surges?

00:14:37.084 --> 00:14:38.060
What?

00:14:38.060 --> 00:14:42.430
And so in a lot of
emerging countries,

00:14:42.430 --> 00:14:45.410
the power goes on and off
because it's inconsistent.

00:14:45.410 --> 00:14:49.790
And when the power comes on,
there is a power surge-- ff!

00:14:49.790 --> 00:14:51.680
And sometimes the
power surge is so

00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:55.940
strong it comes through
and blows up the equipment.

00:14:55.940 --> 00:14:58.560
So we're asking them to
invest millions of dollars

00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:02.530
in this super-duper
core router, and we

00:15:02.530 --> 00:15:05.130
haven't helped them
protect that investment

00:15:05.130 --> 00:15:10.690
by knowing a very small
detail of their needs, right?

00:15:10.690 --> 00:15:13.322
So of course the presenter
was caught off guard,

00:15:13.322 --> 00:15:15.030
hadn't done their
homework, didn't really

00:15:15.030 --> 00:15:17.330
know what the true
customer needs were.

00:15:17.330 --> 00:15:21.364
And we didn't get to answer
the question really well.

00:15:21.364 --> 00:15:22.780
So thank you for
bringing that up.

00:15:22.780 --> 00:15:24.774
And so it's these
little nuances, right?

00:15:24.774 --> 00:15:26.690
So you look through the
list, and you're like,

00:15:26.690 --> 00:15:27.780
yes, I know that.

00:15:27.780 --> 00:15:29.960
But do we really
know these things?

00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:31.760
Do we really think
of these things

00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:37.120
before we just jump in, right
down to the execution detail?

00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:39.500
SPEAKER 1: Loosely
how do we develop

00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:43.300
products for countries and/or
people where we are not, right?

00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:44.670
How do we do that effectively?

00:15:44.670 --> 00:15:45.780
It that remotely close?

00:15:45.780 --> 00:15:46.280
Yeah.

00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:47.710
AMY KARAM: Really good question.

00:15:47.710 --> 00:15:50.260
And whether it's good
or bad, really it's

00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:53.390
the business case that
makes it happen or not.

00:15:53.390 --> 00:15:56.610
And that was a little
bit of the challenge

00:15:56.610 --> 00:16:01.010
that I've encountered in
the past, is you can say,

00:16:01.010 --> 00:16:02.950
emerging markets
really needs this,

00:16:02.950 --> 00:16:05.720
and then management will
say, show me the numbers,

00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:06.840
give me the estimates.

00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:08.530
What are the forecasts?

00:16:08.530 --> 00:16:13.040
So if you can give them some
sort of revenue projections, A,

00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:14.820
but then the quick
answer is going to be,

00:16:14.820 --> 00:16:18.870
oh, but that's so small relative
to our larger revenue stream.

00:16:18.870 --> 00:16:24.540
So my other angle to that
is the strategic importance

00:16:24.540 --> 00:16:27.720
of addressing that market with
that product or that solution,

00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:28.220
right?

00:16:28.220 --> 00:16:31.500
So it's the opportunity
cost of not being there.

00:16:31.500 --> 00:16:35.480
And a lot of companies are
punished if they're not, right?

00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:37.920
When you're slow to market,
and I talk a little bit

00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:41.540
about this in there, time to
market is really important.

00:16:41.540 --> 00:16:43.605
And you can't dilly
dally and think about it

00:16:43.605 --> 00:16:46.490
and analyze too long,
because there are so

00:16:46.490 --> 00:16:49.900
many other competitors out
there ready and waiting

00:16:49.900 --> 00:16:51.690
and addressing that market.

00:16:51.690 --> 00:16:53.800
So even if you do
decide eventually,

00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:56.660
sure, we're going to play, you
may have missed that window.

00:16:56.660 --> 00:16:59.450
And it's the longer-term view.

00:16:59.450 --> 00:17:01.840
You asked me last question
about recommendations.

00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:05.000
It really comes down to
really committing and having

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:09.042
that longer-term strategic
view that enables that.

00:17:09.042 --> 00:17:10.750
SPEAKER 1: And I think
what's interesting

00:17:10.750 --> 00:17:13.530
about your point is as a
developer, so someone who's

00:17:13.530 --> 00:17:15.935
in product development as
opposed to the sales side,

00:17:15.935 --> 00:17:17.310
you actually talk
about something

00:17:17.310 --> 00:17:22.099
in your book about relationships
and patience in the long term

00:17:22.099 --> 00:17:23.565
and how important that is.

00:17:23.565 --> 00:17:27.579
So I wonder how much that plays
into the development lifecycle

00:17:27.579 --> 00:17:30.561
and thinking about making sure
that your relationships are

00:17:30.561 --> 00:17:32.560
long term and you're in
there for the long haul.

00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:33.476
AMY KARAM: Yeah, huge.

00:17:33.476 --> 00:17:34.840
Yeah.

00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:36.780
And then when you develop
those relationships,

00:17:36.780 --> 00:17:42.320
you get that real
on-the-street data that

00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:44.989
helps you support that case.

00:17:44.989 --> 00:17:47.030
SPEAKER 1: Right at the
very beginning you talked

00:17:47.030 --> 00:17:48.850
about the innovation advantage.

00:17:48.850 --> 00:17:52.150
So tell us how Western-based
companies can maintain

00:17:52.150 --> 00:17:54.714
our innovation advantage.

00:17:54.714 --> 00:17:55.380
AMY KARAM: Yeah.

00:17:55.380 --> 00:17:58.130
Thanks for coming back to that.

00:17:58.130 --> 00:18:00.440
So the key crux of it is
the innovation advantage

00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:04.380
is the coveted prize,
the white flag at the top

00:18:04.380 --> 00:18:05.620
of the mountain, right?

00:18:05.620 --> 00:18:07.830
At the beginning of the
book, we talk about strengths

00:18:07.830 --> 00:18:09.230
and weaknesses of each side.

00:18:09.230 --> 00:18:13.490
But ultimately, every--
I'm generalizing,

00:18:13.490 --> 00:18:16.114
but every company
of East to West

00:18:16.114 --> 00:18:18.280
really wants to be innovative,
because that's really

00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:22.600
where the next phase
of growth comes from.

00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:27.670
And so we see contingents
of emerging folks coming

00:18:27.670 --> 00:18:30.670
to Silicon Valley wanting
to learn the secret of how

00:18:30.670 --> 00:18:32.500
is Silicon Valley innovative.

00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:33.370
How do you do it?

00:18:33.370 --> 00:18:34.930
How do you become creative?

00:18:34.930 --> 00:18:37.840
But the idea is that we have
to also be creative, too.

00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:40.840
We have to be innovative
at being innovative.

00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:43.800
So you can't just
rest on your laurels.

00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:46.440
This whole concept of
innovation is evolving.

00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:50.020
And as more players from
different backgrounds

00:18:50.020 --> 00:18:53.140
are becoming innovative, they're
bringing different business

00:18:53.140 --> 00:18:53.640
models.

00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:55.910
So we talk about five
different business models.

00:18:55.910 --> 00:18:58.231
And a couple of them are
business model innovation,

00:18:58.231 --> 00:18:58.730
right?

00:18:58.730 --> 00:19:00.220
That's coming from the East.

00:19:00.220 --> 00:19:01.450
What are they really good at?

00:19:01.450 --> 00:19:04.520
They're really good at
commercializing things.

00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:06.130
And again, I'm
going to generalize.

00:19:06.130 --> 00:19:09.290
We're really good at making
things, really cool things.

00:19:09.290 --> 00:19:11.430
But they're really
good at making money

00:19:11.430 --> 00:19:14.090
from really cool things
or even making money

00:19:14.090 --> 00:19:16.300
from OK-cool things.

00:19:16.300 --> 00:19:20.380
We also talk about supply-chain
or process innovation.

00:19:20.380 --> 00:19:23.450
I mean, there's the
reputation of manufacturing.

00:19:23.450 --> 00:19:28.850
They've got it down to a T.
So one venture capitalist

00:19:28.850 --> 00:19:31.830
who I interviewed
in the book said,

00:19:31.830 --> 00:19:34.960
you know, all this business
about bringing manufacturing

00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:38.620
back to America, we don't
have the efficiencies.

00:19:38.620 --> 00:19:42.330
We don't have the
ecosystems yet to do that.

00:19:42.330 --> 00:19:47.260
And some of the Eastern
countries do, right?

00:19:47.260 --> 00:19:50.810
And we need to either
establish that ecosystem

00:19:50.810 --> 00:19:53.690
or just understand
that, that there's

00:19:53.690 --> 00:19:57.100
a different source of
innovation happening out there.

00:19:57.100 --> 00:19:57.600
Yeah.

00:19:57.600 --> 00:19:58.476
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:19:58.476 --> 00:20:00.849
AMY KARAM: I'm just generalizing
to be more encompassing.

00:20:00.849 --> 00:20:02.308
Like it's based
out of China, and I

00:20:02.308 --> 00:20:03.765
don't want to just
pigeonhole China

00:20:03.765 --> 00:20:05.160
as being the
manufacturing giant,

00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:07.080
because they're
evolving out of that,

00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:09.720
and other countries
are growing into that.

00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:11.900
Bangladesh and Vietnam
are becoming so.

00:20:11.900 --> 00:20:14.800
But I mean, it's even
humorous to see an emerging

00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:18.440
country like Mexico
outsourcing to China,

00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:21.150
or they have done in the past,
outsourcing their manufacturing

00:20:21.150 --> 00:20:21.649
to China.

00:20:21.649 --> 00:20:23.530
It's like their
unemployment is high.

00:20:23.530 --> 00:20:27.280
Why can't-- it is
so efficient there.

00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:28.805
They are so smart
about it there.

00:20:28.805 --> 00:20:32.967
And let's not even think about
the shipping costs alone.

00:20:32.967 --> 00:20:34.050
So that's what I'm saying.

00:20:34.050 --> 00:20:36.440
All I'm saying is let's
get more creative.

00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:41.720
Let's figure out what's
our innovation 2.0 or 5.0

00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:43.590
or whatever the rev
is that we're on.

00:20:43.590 --> 00:20:47.150
How are we going
to step up our game

00:20:47.150 --> 00:20:48.610
and learn from others as well?

00:20:48.610 --> 00:20:50.470
SPEAKER 1: So we talked
a little yesterday

00:20:50.470 --> 00:20:54.230
about companies that you
thought were doing this well

00:20:54.230 --> 00:20:57.457
or an example of a model
that's doing this well

00:20:57.457 --> 00:20:58.290
or doing a good job.

00:20:58.290 --> 00:21:01.650
AMY KARAM: Oh, yeah, let's talk
about your own Hugo Barra, OK?

00:21:01.650 --> 00:21:04.580
So Xiaomi recruited Hugo Barra.

00:21:04.580 --> 00:21:05.890
That's one of the 13, right?

00:21:05.890 --> 00:21:07.790
Talent is one of
the recommendations.

00:21:07.790 --> 00:21:10.580
They recruited your
own Hugo Barra,

00:21:10.580 --> 00:21:13.830
who is running the
Android product line here.

00:21:13.830 --> 00:21:17.940
They've made VP
Global of Xiaomi.

00:21:17.940 --> 00:21:21.310
Their phone is based on
the Android platform,

00:21:21.310 --> 00:21:25.360
but they've been criticized for
it looking like an iPhone, OK?

00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:27.560
So they're doing
the mix and match.

00:21:27.560 --> 00:21:30.560
And then they've applied
it to their Chinese market.

00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:35.070
And they've capitalized
on the local--

00:21:35.070 --> 00:21:37.850
the Chinese social
media phenomenon.

00:21:37.850 --> 00:21:41.760
I think it's WeChat that
everybody's all over, right?

00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:45.274
And they have fans, right?

00:21:45.274 --> 00:21:46.440
There they're not customers.

00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:47.610
They're called fans.

00:21:47.610 --> 00:21:50.039
And there's direct
access to the fan base.

00:21:50.039 --> 00:21:52.080
And they tell them what's
working with the phone.

00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:55.370
So, wow, they just shaved
off millions of R&amp;D

00:21:55.370 --> 00:21:59.310
because the actual end
users are telling them what

00:21:59.310 --> 00:22:00.830
they need to have improved.

00:22:00.830 --> 00:22:04.270
They have real-time, like
almost weekly, software updates,

00:22:04.270 --> 00:22:04.770
right?

00:22:04.770 --> 00:22:10.470
So they're not waiting
for the next iPhone 6S

00:22:10.470 --> 00:22:13.250
to come out in eight months
with line-ups around the corner,

00:22:13.250 --> 00:22:13.750
right?

00:22:13.750 --> 00:22:16.580
There's that regular updates,
which is also the Android

00:22:16.580 --> 00:22:18.290
platform that enables that.

00:22:18.290 --> 00:22:19.590
So they've adapted.

00:22:19.590 --> 00:22:22.940
They've taken innovation
from all over,

00:22:22.940 --> 00:22:26.670
including the talent, put
it in a different market,

00:22:26.670 --> 00:22:30.880
used the local market dynamics
to make it super successful.

00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:32.920
And what I really like
about this example,

00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:37.520
too, is they are very
shrewd about knowing

00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:40.270
that this model isn't
going to necessarily work

00:22:40.270 --> 00:22:44.730
as they go to other countries as
they do their market expansion

00:22:44.730 --> 00:22:45.640
strategy.

00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:49.070
So for example,
in the Philippines

00:22:49.070 --> 00:22:50.660
they don't do a
lot of chat, right?

00:22:50.660 --> 00:22:52.269
They don't do a lot of Twitter.

00:22:52.269 --> 00:22:53.060
And they know that.

00:22:53.060 --> 00:22:54.434
And so like, OK,
that's not going

00:22:54.434 --> 00:22:59.090
to be a success element for us,
nor is the fact that our CEO is

00:22:59.090 --> 00:23:01.320
a rock star in China, right?

00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:02.950
So that's not going
to be-- how are

00:23:02.950 --> 00:23:06.050
we going to modify our market
expansion strategy to be

00:23:06.050 --> 00:23:07.380
successful elsewhere?

00:23:07.380 --> 00:23:10.160
So, yeah, that's
just one example

00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:12.830
of doing a combined strategy.

00:23:12.830 --> 00:23:16.090
SPEAKER 1: How worried should
Western companies be about IP?

00:23:16.090 --> 00:23:17.610
AMY KARAM: It's a big deal.

00:23:17.610 --> 00:23:19.210
Everybody should be
worried about it.

00:23:19.210 --> 00:23:21.680
Eastern companies should
be worried about it, too.

00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:23.860
And that's the ongoing debate.

00:23:23.860 --> 00:23:26.260
In fact, there was
another headline recently

00:23:26.260 --> 00:23:31.170
about the word "iPhone" being
used for another product.

00:23:31.170 --> 00:23:33.760
I think they were just
leather goods in China.

00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:34.990
And it was in the courts.

00:23:34.990 --> 00:23:36.550
I hear some head nods, right?

00:23:36.550 --> 00:23:38.710
There was a debate
over many years,

00:23:38.710 --> 00:23:41.790
and their court said it was OK.

00:23:41.790 --> 00:23:47.070
So then you get into
international law

00:23:47.070 --> 00:23:48.260
and regulation.

00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:51.250
And then sometimes you bring in
the World Trade Organization.

00:23:51.250 --> 00:23:54.530
What does the World Trade
Organization say or do?

00:23:54.530 --> 00:23:58.310
But then you have to figure
out, does that country

00:23:58.310 --> 00:24:00.170
or that competitor care?

00:24:00.170 --> 00:24:01.770
What are the implications?

00:24:01.770 --> 00:24:03.790
So, yes, we need to care.

00:24:03.790 --> 00:24:05.980
And in fact,
Michelle Lee is doing

00:24:05.980 --> 00:24:10.650
a really great job of that, and
she's quoted in the book, too.

00:24:10.650 --> 00:24:15.020
She's heading up the whole
intellectual property

00:24:15.020 --> 00:24:19.720
issue for the US government.

00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:25.390
And this comes up with the whole
TPP issue, the Trans Pacific

00:24:25.390 --> 00:24:26.954
Partnership agreement.

00:24:26.954 --> 00:24:28.870
And a lot of people are
saying, this is great.

00:24:28.870 --> 00:24:31.470
And then a lot of
people are saying, hm,

00:24:31.470 --> 00:24:33.630
we better be careful,
because what's that going

00:24:33.630 --> 00:24:36.160
to mean for our own protection?

00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:38.580
And it goes both ways, right?

00:24:38.580 --> 00:24:40.370
And that comes back
to politics as well.

00:24:40.370 --> 00:24:42.450
There's that back
and forth in terms

00:24:42.450 --> 00:24:44.900
of protectionist measures.

00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:47.810
I know recently,
of course, and you

00:24:47.810 --> 00:24:51.360
know as well, China has
pulled back on market access

00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:53.766
to a lot of
Western-based countries,

00:24:53.766 --> 00:24:55.140
for different
reasons, of course.

00:24:55.140 --> 00:25:01.062
But all I'm trying to
say is it goes both ways.

00:25:01.062 --> 00:25:02.520
So the government
is looking at it,

00:25:02.520 --> 00:25:04.130
I guess is the short answer.

00:25:04.130 --> 00:25:07.334
And be very prudent and careful.

00:25:07.334 --> 00:25:08.780
Yeah,

00:25:08.780 --> 00:25:10.830
SPEAKER 1: So in what
way can governments

00:25:10.830 --> 00:25:12.250
be helpful and play a role?

00:25:12.250 --> 00:25:14.830
And in what way can
they not be helpful?

00:25:14.830 --> 00:25:15.720
AMY KARAM: OK.

00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:18.260
So governments
are there for you,

00:25:18.260 --> 00:25:22.700
the trade groups, the
trade commissions.

00:25:22.700 --> 00:25:27.340
They have contingents that
take you out and help you

00:25:27.340 --> 00:25:28.397
with market access.

00:25:28.397 --> 00:25:29.980
And they give you
the lay of the land.

00:25:29.980 --> 00:25:31.870
They give you contacts, right?

00:25:31.870 --> 00:25:35.960
And they give you the heads
up on what yes, what no to do.

00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:41.460
And one of the
challenges with that

00:25:41.460 --> 00:25:45.950
as well is that we have
a very fair government,

00:25:45.950 --> 00:25:48.030
and they don't play favorites.

00:25:48.030 --> 00:25:56.430
So the extreme, the extent to
which they will help companies,

00:25:56.430 --> 00:25:58.100
is very limited
because they have

00:25:58.100 --> 00:26:00.030
to be very fair to everyone.

00:26:00.030 --> 00:26:02.940
They can't favor any
particular company

00:26:02.940 --> 00:26:04.640
in a particular industry.

00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:05.620
So it gets very tricky.

00:26:05.620 --> 00:26:08.150
And they're very aware
of that challenge.

00:26:08.150 --> 00:26:11.840
Because other
countries' governments

00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:14.660
are much more
aggressive when it does

00:26:14.660 --> 00:26:19.950
come to presenting a
certain company abroad.

00:26:19.950 --> 00:26:21.420
So I guess they're
looking at it,

00:26:21.420 --> 00:26:23.880
but it's very
difficult to change

00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:28.149
based on our democratic
fairness system.

00:26:28.149 --> 00:26:29.690
And what was the
second part of that?

00:26:29.690 --> 00:26:31.314
SPEAKER 1: How can
they not be helpful?

00:26:31.314 --> 00:26:35.110
AMY KARAM: Yeah, that's sort
of how they're not helpful.

00:26:35.110 --> 00:26:37.870
And they need to just get
more involved, to be honest.

00:26:37.870 --> 00:26:39.380
There's a lot of groups.

00:26:39.380 --> 00:26:42.360
And so for example in the
high-tech industry, even

00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:44.700
competitors have
been coming together

00:26:44.700 --> 00:26:47.320
to share some of their
challenges and their complaints

00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:51.142
and going as a cooperative
group to the government

00:26:51.142 --> 00:26:52.600
to present some of
these challenges

00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:56.430
and ask them to make some
changes in how they present

00:26:56.430 --> 00:26:58.130
or represent us abroad.

00:26:58.130 --> 00:27:00.390
I mean, quite simply, even
with the trade agreements,

00:27:00.390 --> 00:27:03.970
how are we really
leveraging those like China

00:27:03.970 --> 00:27:06.680
and other countries do?

00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:09.170
So there are ways that
we can step it up,

00:27:09.170 --> 00:27:12.362
but I think it's a
slow, ongoing process.

00:27:12.362 --> 00:27:13.820
SPEAKER 1: Companies
that you think

00:27:13.820 --> 00:27:16.800
are just not doing this
well, or did you see examples

00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:18.630
of this not working well?

00:27:18.630 --> 00:27:20.800
AMY KARAM: Yes, sometimes
we're just too arrogant.

00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:22.670
And we don't-- I am
going to generalize,

00:27:22.670 --> 00:27:27.190
so I don't want to name names,
but as Western-based companies,

00:27:27.190 --> 00:27:29.030
we don't get it sometimes.

00:27:29.030 --> 00:27:34.210
And I talk about
cultural IQ in the book.

00:27:34.210 --> 00:27:37.570
And again, we've all been very
sensitized to that, especially

00:27:37.570 --> 00:27:39.520
here in the US and
in Silicon Valley,

00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:42.850
but it's really taking
it to that next step

00:27:42.850 --> 00:27:45.770
and really appreciating
the local nuances

00:27:45.770 --> 00:27:51.430
before we just dive in, because
they'll quickly throw us out.

00:27:51.430 --> 00:27:57.460
And then we look baffled
when it doesn't work.

00:27:57.460 --> 00:27:59.830
I'm just I'm just
thinking back to just even

00:27:59.830 --> 00:28:01.520
a stint that I did
in South Africa.

00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:04.830
And we went in
literally for two days,

00:28:04.830 --> 00:28:06.680
did a little bit
of meetings, did

00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:08.760
I'm embarrassed to
say a 24-hour safari.

00:28:08.760 --> 00:28:11.310
Yes, we did see almost
all the animals that we

00:28:11.310 --> 00:28:13.670
needed to see in 24 hours.

00:28:13.670 --> 00:28:17.320
And we flew out, and we
felt really good about it.

00:28:17.320 --> 00:28:20.140
But we didn't get the business.

00:28:20.140 --> 00:28:21.570
It's just, why?

00:28:21.570 --> 00:28:22.290
Why didn't they?

00:28:22.290 --> 00:28:23.790
Well, because you can't.

00:28:23.790 --> 00:28:27.680
You can't just swoop
in, fly in, and expect

00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:31.290
to build that relationship
instantly just because we've

00:28:31.290 --> 00:28:32.710
got brand equity.

00:28:32.710 --> 00:28:35.810
SPEAKER 1: There was a piece
in the question about financing

00:28:35.810 --> 00:28:38.430
and government
involvement in financing,

00:28:38.430 --> 00:28:40.650
specifically using
China as an example,

00:28:40.650 --> 00:28:44.400
and whether that's a
model that will continue

00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:47.550
or whether the model will
actually look very different.

00:28:47.550 --> 00:28:49.140
AMY KARAM: Yeah,
and then there was

00:28:49.140 --> 00:28:52.280
a second part we'll get to, too,
which was really interesting.

00:28:52.280 --> 00:28:53.100
So yeah, let's get
to the financing.

00:28:53.100 --> 00:28:54.850
I'm glad you brought
that up, because this

00:28:54.850 --> 00:28:59.960
is a really huge challenge
for Western-based countries

00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:00.910
and companies.

00:29:03.980 --> 00:29:07.400
So the good news is-- and
I'm happy to talk about this

00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:09.510
because I've been very
passionate about it--

00:29:09.510 --> 00:29:13.770
we have a lot of international
development banks

00:29:13.770 --> 00:29:15.110
that can tap into this, right?

00:29:15.110 --> 00:29:16.630
So I would get the complaints.

00:29:16.630 --> 00:29:18.760
It's like, hey, how do
I compete with this?

00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:19.760
There's financing.

00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:21.920
They just gave this
company $10 billion

00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:23.380
over this amount of time.

00:29:23.380 --> 00:29:27.300
Like, sorry, we don't have
that kind of cash to give out,

00:29:27.300 --> 00:29:29.460
nor would we, because
that's not what we do.

00:29:29.460 --> 00:29:32.110
However, let's look
at these programs.

00:29:32.110 --> 00:29:34.180
So there are international
development banks

00:29:34.180 --> 00:29:35.420
that you can tap into.

00:29:35.420 --> 00:29:38.880
You can allocate maybe
half a headcount or one

00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:40.320
or two headcounts for it.

00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:42.820
And all you do is comb the
projects that are coming up.

00:29:42.820 --> 00:29:45.800
There is cash waiting to be had.

00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:49.210
And it's really bridging
that private sector

00:29:49.210 --> 00:29:52.340
to that customer in the emerging
country and saying, hey,

00:29:52.340 --> 00:29:54.500
we can help you with
that development.

00:29:54.500 --> 00:29:57.470
And let us help you
fill out the forms.

00:29:57.470 --> 00:30:00.490
And whoa-- voila-- you
just helped your customer

00:30:00.490 --> 00:30:02.980
finance the purchase
of your equipment.

00:30:02.980 --> 00:30:06.480
And by the way, you just
established a relationship

00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:09.090
because you're
helping them execute

00:30:09.090 --> 00:30:10.640
in ways that they may not have.

00:30:10.640 --> 00:30:13.730
So that's just one
small way to do it.

00:30:13.730 --> 00:30:18.230
And then it's also-- companies
can get a little bit more

00:30:18.230 --> 00:30:21.190
assertive with risk-taking.

00:30:21.190 --> 00:30:24.230
So Cisco had Cisco
Capital, and we

00:30:24.230 --> 00:30:28.650
were very conservative about who
Cisco capital put money out to.

00:30:28.650 --> 00:30:33.600
But eventually, we
came to the realization

00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:36.080
that, hey, we're really
serious about emerging markets,

00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:40.470
and perhaps we are
ready to have a fund,

00:30:40.470 --> 00:30:43.440
a special strategic
fund, for key business

00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:46.460
that is really
important for us to win.

00:30:46.460 --> 00:30:49.580
And we're going to be very
diligent about assessing

00:30:49.580 --> 00:30:52.670
who we lend that money
to, but hey, why not?

00:30:52.670 --> 00:30:55.670
And that just shows a little
bit more of a commitment.

00:30:55.670 --> 00:30:57.220
Now let's get back
to your question.

00:30:57.220 --> 00:30:59.701
You also talked about
pockets in the world

00:30:59.701 --> 00:31:01.700
that would influence
product development because

00:31:01.700 --> 00:31:02.408
of the financing?

00:31:02.408 --> 00:31:04.640
AUDIENCE: Yeah, [INAUDIBLE].

00:31:04.640 --> 00:31:05.390
AMY KARAM: Yes.

00:31:05.390 --> 00:31:06.389
The quick answer is yes.

00:31:06.389 --> 00:31:10.800
So she's essentially saying,
based on local market needs

00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:14.600
and trends, especially
from a technology usage,

00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:19.950
is that going to influence
product development locally?

00:31:19.950 --> 00:31:22.420
And is it not going
to be centralized?

00:31:22.420 --> 00:31:26.140
Is innovation not going to
be centralized in one place?

00:31:26.140 --> 00:31:27.560
Absolutely yes.

00:31:27.560 --> 00:31:31.030
Yes, I say very emphatically.

00:31:31.030 --> 00:31:31.940
That's the point.

00:31:31.940 --> 00:31:36.320
We need to start looking at
that and localizing innovation

00:31:36.320 --> 00:31:38.680
based on local customer needs.

00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:41.264
SPEAKER 1: How are people
using this material like today?

00:31:41.264 --> 00:31:41.930
AMY KARAM: Yeah.

00:31:41.930 --> 00:31:43.950
So I did take a lot
of pride in the fact

00:31:43.950 --> 00:31:47.040
that this is-- I wanted it
to be a practical guide,

00:31:47.040 --> 00:31:50.717
like a toolbox for business
people to kind of go through

00:31:50.717 --> 00:31:52.050
and see what they can implement.

00:31:52.050 --> 00:31:54.790
So it's a checklist.

00:31:54.790 --> 00:31:56.550
There's a framework inside.

00:31:56.550 --> 00:31:58.460
I even have like
a rough template

00:31:58.460 --> 00:32:01.620
in the back where you can
get your folks together

00:32:01.620 --> 00:32:06.440
and strategize about your
next global expansion endeavor

00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:09.110
and ask yourself
certain questions.

00:32:09.110 --> 00:32:10.740
But I'm also giving workshops.

00:32:10.740 --> 00:32:12.850
And I like to facilitate
the discussion

00:32:12.850 --> 00:32:14.780
and get the ball rolling.

00:32:14.780 --> 00:32:20.480
And a lot of times it's at
corporations with similar teams

00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:23.725
that are trying to build their
global expansion strategy.

00:32:23.725 --> 00:32:25.850
And it's stirring the pot
and getting them to think

00:32:25.850 --> 00:32:27.440
about certain elements.

00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:32.420
And I love seeing the
thread of influence, right?

00:32:32.420 --> 00:32:35.100
So it's looking at the
five-piece framework,

00:32:35.100 --> 00:32:37.280
and as simple as
it may sound, when

00:32:37.280 --> 00:32:41.670
you look at the
competitive dynamic that

00:32:41.670 --> 00:32:45.160
might rebut your
strategy, it really

00:32:45.160 --> 00:32:48.040
shows you how you might
want to reconsider

00:32:48.040 --> 00:32:52.970
and how a decision in
one element or one area

00:32:52.970 --> 00:32:55.670
will influence the other areas.

00:32:55.670 --> 00:32:59.976
So it's that puppeteering and
really thinking it through,

00:32:59.976 --> 00:33:02.510
through the workshops
and the courses.

00:33:02.510 --> 00:33:05.490
It really makes an
impact at the end.

00:33:05.490 --> 00:33:06.500
SPEAKER 1: Great.

00:33:06.500 --> 00:33:10.700
Just maybe on a closing note,
there's so much in this book,

00:33:10.700 --> 00:33:12.990
and it's wonderful to read.

00:33:12.990 --> 00:33:15.120
And there are
controversial pieces,

00:33:15.120 --> 00:33:18.480
and one can sometimes
leave feeling worried

00:33:18.480 --> 00:33:19.240
and/or challenged.

00:33:19.240 --> 00:33:20.650
But you are so positive.

00:33:20.650 --> 00:33:29.020
So tell us what makes you so
positive just about this topic.

00:33:29.020 --> 00:33:32.130
AMY KARAM: I think the
reinforcement from industry,

00:33:32.130 --> 00:33:35.960
from people that have lived
it, people who were there.

00:33:35.960 --> 00:33:38.670
You mentioned Ken Wilcox,
who wrote the forward.

00:33:38.670 --> 00:33:41.510
I mean, just the
validation from people

00:33:41.510 --> 00:33:44.520
out there that are like,
yes, this is a need.

00:33:44.520 --> 00:33:45.690
This needs to be done.

00:33:45.690 --> 00:33:48.970
And the idea that we all
do need to work together,

00:33:48.970 --> 00:33:50.440
the idea that it's co-opetition.

00:33:50.440 --> 00:33:52.300
It's no longer a
competition game.

00:33:52.300 --> 00:33:56.370
We need to learn how to learn
from each other equally,

00:33:56.370 --> 00:33:59.800
and that's also playing
in each other's sandboxes

00:33:59.800 --> 00:34:01.920
and learning how to do
that respectfully given

00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:07.190
our different boundaries
and limitations.

00:34:07.190 --> 00:34:09.850
So I just think it's necessary.

00:34:09.850 --> 00:34:13.739
We just need to figure
out how to recalibrate,

00:34:13.739 --> 00:34:16.822
and everybody will
be successful.

00:34:16.822 --> 00:34:17.530
SPEAKER 1: Great.

00:34:17.530 --> 00:34:18.230
Thank you.

00:34:18.230 --> 00:34:19.340
Well, thank you for that.

00:34:19.340 --> 00:34:20.830
Amy is going to stick
around a little bit

00:34:20.830 --> 00:34:23.090
to answer questions for those
of you that are in the room

00:34:23.090 --> 00:34:24.139
and would like to stay.

00:34:24.139 --> 00:34:25.630
Thank you so much
for coming, Amy.

00:34:25.630 --> 00:34:26.360
AMY KARAM: Thank
you for having me.

00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:27.126
I had a good time.

00:34:27.126 --> 00:34:27.920
SPEAKER 1: Great.

00:34:27.920 --> 00:34:29.086
AMY KARAM: Thanks, everyone.

00:34:29.086 --> 00:34:32.668
[APPLAUSE]
