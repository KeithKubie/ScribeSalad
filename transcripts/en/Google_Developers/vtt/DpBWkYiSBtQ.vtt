EMILY FORTUNA: One
of my favorite things

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.070
about working on
Flutter is I get

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.020
to connect with people
from all over the world

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:33.360
to make their mobile
app ideas possible.

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.520
You may recognize me
from the presentations

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.509
I've given at Google
I/O, or on YouTube,

00:00:37.509 --> 00:00:39.300
like the "Flutter Boring
Development Show."

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.830
MARTIN AGUINIS: You might
be familiar with my voice

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:42.750
on the "Introducing
Flutter" animation video,

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.510
or from some of my talks at
GDD China and Google Marketing

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:46.422

00:00:46.422 --> 00:00:47.130

I am the co-founder and Lead
Product Manager at [INAUDIBLE]..

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.260
With Flutter, it's been
really, really easy

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:17.790
to bring my ideas to life.

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.580
MARTIN AGUINIS: Here we are
inside the science museum IMAX,

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.840
and this screen is huge.

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.170
It's so big that you can
fit four double-decker buses

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.490
on top of each other.

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.514
Here we are in front
of Registration,

00:01:31.514 --> 00:01:33.680
where all the on-site
attendees will be checking in.

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.500
But right after the
keynote, in this space

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.860
we have some really cool demos
and activations to show you.

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.100
All the way in the
back of the room,

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:40.683
we're going to have
a massive showcase

00:01:40.683 --> 00:01:43.860
wall, with 99 phones that have
Flutter apps loaded on them.

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.330
[UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:53.246 --> 00:01:55.860
Nilay, you have
done an amazing job

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.070
at building up the Flutter
community all around the world.

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.340
I am seriously impressed.

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.140
NILAY YENER: Basically,
the community

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.860
attracted me about the Flutter,
and I just looked into that.

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.150
And it was a great team.

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:08.010
I'm so happy being in this team.

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:09.509
MARTIN AGUINIS: So
I'm standing here

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.510
with Eric Seidel, who is one
of the founders of Flutter.

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.110
Was there a moment where you
went, wow, this is legitimate?

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:17.280
This is really taking off.

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.150
ERIC SEIDEL: I think the biggest
moment for me was "Hamilton."

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.877
When we saw the
"Hamilton" app ship, when

00:02:23.877 --> 00:02:25.710
we saw that team be
successful with Flutter,

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:28.620
helped me believe that,
yeah, anybody can use this.

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.170
MARTIN AGUINIS: (RAPPING)
The $10 founding father

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.480
without a father got a
lot farther by working

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.520
a lot harder, by
being a lot smarter,

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:36.800
by being a self-starter.

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:40.543
By 14, they placed him in
charge of a trading charter.

00:02:40.543 --> 00:02:41.584
EMILY FORTUNA: (LAUGHING)

00:02:41.584 --> 00:02:42.075
MARTIN AGUINIS: (LAUGHING)

00:02:42.075 --> 00:02:42.741
SPEAKER 9: Yeah!

00:02:42.741 --> 00:02:45.235
[WHISTLING]

00:02:45.235 --> 00:02:46.360
EMILY FORTUNA: Flutter 1.0!

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.000
MARTIN AGUINIS:
Flutter 1.0 is here.
