deep learning algorithms have a huge

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:02.220
deep learning algorithms have a huge
 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:03.889
deep learning algorithms have a huge
hunger for training data

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:03.899
hunger for training data
 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:06.410
hunger for training data
they just often work best we can find

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:06.420
they just often work best we can find
 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:08.750
they just often work best we can find
enough labor training data to put into

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760
enough labor training data to put into
 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:09.709
enough labor training data to put into
the training center

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719
the training center
 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:12.290

this is resulted in many teams sometimes

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300
this is resulted in many teams sometimes
 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.270
this is resulted in many teams sometimes
taking one of the days you can find and

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280
taking one of the days you can find and
 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:15.919
taking one of the days you can find and
just shoving it into the training set

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929
just shoving it into the training set
 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.410
just shoving it into the training set
just to get more training data even as

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420
just to get more training data even as
 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.570
just to get more training data even as
some of this data or even if maybe a lot

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580
some of this data or even if maybe a lot
 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.609

so in a deep learning error more and
 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.259
so in a deep learning error more and
more teams are now training on data that

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269
more teams are now training on data that
 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.540
more teams are now training on data that
comes from a different distribution than

comes from a different distribution than
 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.090
comes from a different distribution than
your depth and test set and there's some

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.319
subtleties and some best practices but
dealing with when you train and test

dealing with when you train and test
 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.209

distributions differ from each other
let's take a look not say that you're

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070
let's take a look not say that you're
 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.420
let's take a look not say that you're
building a mobile app where users will

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430
building a mobile app where users will
 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.520
building a mobile app where users will
upload pictures take from the cell

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530
upload pictures take from the cell
 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.139
upload pictures take from the cell
phones and you want to recognize whether

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149
phones and you want to recognize whether
 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.540
phones and you want to recognize whether
the picture is that your users upload

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550
the picture is that your users upload
 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.510
the picture is that your users upload
from the mobile app is a cat or not so

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520
from the mobile app is a cat or not so
 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.599
from the mobile app is a cat or not so
you can now get two sources of data one

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609
you can now get two sources of data one
 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.700
you can now get two sources of data one
which is the distribution of data you

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710
which is the distribution of data you
 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.439
which is the distribution of data you
really care about this data from a

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449
really care about this data from a
 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.390
really care about this data from a
mobile app like that on the right which

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400
mobile app like that on the right which
 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.640
mobile app like that on the right which
tends to be less professionally shots

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650
tends to be less professionally shots
 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.070
tends to be less professionally shots
less warframe maybe the blurrier to the

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080
less warframe maybe the blurrier to the
 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.800
less warframe maybe the blurrier to the
short pipe you know amateur users the

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810
short pipe you know amateur users the
 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.450
short pipe you know amateur users the
other source of data you can get is you

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460
other source of data you can get is you
 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.730
other source of data you can get is you
can crawl the web and just download a

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740
can crawl the web and just download a
 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.950
can crawl the web and just download a
lot of them for the sake of this example

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960
lot of them for the sake of this example
 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.560
lot of them for the sake of this example
let's you can download a lot of very

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570
let's you can download a lot of very
 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.109
let's you can download a lot of very
professional trains high-resolution

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119

professionally taken images of cats and

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:26.570
professionally taken images of cats and
 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:28.760
professionally taken images of cats and
let's say you don't have a lot of users

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770
let's say you don't have a lot of users
 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.010
let's say you don't have a lot of users
yet for your mobile apps so maybe you've

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020
yet for your mobile apps so maybe you've
 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.710
yet for your mobile apps so maybe you've
gotten you know 10,000 pictures uploaded

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720
gotten you know 10,000 pictures uploaded
 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.560
gotten you know 10,000 pictures uploaded
from the mobile app but by crawling the

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570
from the mobile app but by crawling the
 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.469
from the mobile app but by crawling the
web you can download huge numbers of cat

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479
web you can download huge numbers of cat
 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.469
web you can download huge numbers of cat
pictures and maybe you have 200,000

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479
pictures and maybe you have 200,000
 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.600
pictures and maybe you have 200,000
pictures of cats downloaded off the

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610
pictures of cats downloaded off the
 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.460
pictures of cats downloaded off the
internet so what you really care about

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470
internet so what you really care about
 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.109
internet so what you really care about
is that your final system does well on

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:53.119
is that your final system does well on
 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:57.370
is that your final system does well on
the mobile app distribution of images

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380
the mobile app distribution of images
 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.959
the mobile app distribution of images
right because in the end your users be

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969
right because in the end your users be
 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.490
right because in the end your users be
uploading pictures like those on the

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500
uploading pictures like those on the
 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.230
uploading pictures like those on the
right and you need your classifier to do

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240
right and you need your classifier to do
 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.080
right and you need your classifier to do
well on that but you now have a bit of a

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090
well on that but you now have a bit of a
 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.910
well on that but you now have a bit of a
dilemma because you have a relatively

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920
dilemma because you have a relatively
 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.830
dilemma because you have a relatively
small data set just 10,000 examples

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840
small data set just 10,000 examples
 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.710
small data set just 10,000 examples
drawn from that distribution

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720
drawn from that distribution
 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.630
drawn from that distribution
and you have a much bigger data set

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640
and you have a much bigger data set
 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:15.980
and you have a much bigger data set
that's drawn from a different

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990
that's drawn from a different
 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:17.900
that's drawn from a different
distribution a different appearance of

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910
distribution a different appearance of
 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.080
distribution a different appearance of
image than the one you actually want so

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090
image than the one you actually want so
 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.300
image than the one you actually want so
you don't want to use just those 10,000

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310
you don't want to use just those 10,000
 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.580
you don't want to use just those 10,000
images because it ends up giving you a

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590
images because it ends up giving you a
 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.000
images because it ends up giving you a
relatively small training set and using

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010
relatively small training set and using
 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.550
relatively small training set and using
this 200,000 images seems helpful but

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560
this 200,000 images seems helpful but
 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.770
this 200,000 images seems helpful but
you know the dilemma is this 200,000

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780
you know the dilemma is this 200,000
 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.690
you know the dilemma is this 200,000
images isn't from exactly the

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700
images isn't from exactly the
 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.860
images isn't from exactly the
distribution you want so what can you do

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870
distribution you want so what can you do
 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:43.910
distribution you want so what can you do
well here's one option one thing to do

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920
well here's one option one thing to do
 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.430
well here's one option one thing to do
is put both of these datasets together

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440
is put both of these datasets together
 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.850
is put both of these datasets together
so you now have two hundred and ten

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860
so you now have two hundred and ten
 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:51.830
so you now have two hundred and ten
thousand images and you can then take

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840
thousand images and you can then take
 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.780
thousand images and you can then take
the two hundred ten thousand images and

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790
the two hundred ten thousand images and
 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:59.680
the two hundred ten thousand images and
randomly shuffle them into a train

00:02:59.680 --> 00:02:59.690
randomly shuffle them into a train
 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:04.010
randomly shuffle them into a train
death and test set and let's say for the

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:04.020
death and test set and let's say for the
 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:06.260
death and test set and let's say for the
sake of argument that you decided that

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:06.270
sake of argument that you decided that
 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:08.660
sake of argument that you decided that
your death in test says will be two

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670
your death in test says will be two
 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:11.420
your death in test says will be two
thousand five hundred examples each so

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430
thousand five hundred examples each so
 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.490
thousand five hundred examples each so
your training sets will be two hundred

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500
your training sets will be two hundred
 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:18.080
your training sets will be two hundred
and five thousand examples now so some

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090
and five thousand examples now so some
 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.180
and five thousand examples now so some
of your data this way it has some

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190
of your data this way it has some
 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:23.540
of your data this way it has some
advantages but also disadvantages the

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:23.550
advantages but also disadvantages the
 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:25.250
advantages but also disadvantages the
advantage is that now your training

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260
advantage is that now your training
 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.170
advantage is that now your training
depth and test sets will all come from

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180
depth and test sets will all come from
 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:28.910
depth and test sets will all come from
the same distribution so that makes it

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920
the same distribution so that makes it
 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:29.690
the same distribution so that makes it
easier to manage

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700
easier to manage
 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.210
easier to manage
but the disadvantage and this is a huge

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220
but the disadvantage and this is a huge
 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.729
but the disadvantage and this is a huge
disadvantage is that if you look at your

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739
disadvantage is that if you look at your
 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:38.390
disadvantage is that if you look at your
def set of this 2500 examples a lot of

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400
def set of this 2500 examples a lot of
 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.400
def set of this 2500 examples a lot of
it will come from the web page

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410
it will come from the web page
 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:43.610
it will come from the web page
distribution of images rather than what

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620
distribution of images rather than what
 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:44.690
distribution of images rather than what
you actually care about which is the

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700
you actually care about which is the
 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:48.620
you actually care about which is the
mobile app distribution of images so it

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:48.630

following the training set let's say
 

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:04.870
following the training set let's say
it's still two hundred five thousand

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:04.880
it's still two hundred five thousand
 

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:09.570

have two hundred thousand all two

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:13.550
have two hundred thousand all two
 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:15.370

hundred thousand images from the web and
 

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:18.250
hundred thousand images from the web and
then you can if you want add in five

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:18.260
then you can if you want add in five
 

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.340
then you can if you want add in five
thousand images from the mobile app and

thousand images from the mobile app and
 

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:23.470
thousand images from the mobile app and
then for your dev and test sets

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:23.480
then for your dev and test sets
 

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:26.590
then for your dev and test sets
I guess my data sets eyes on terms of

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:26.600
I guess my data sets eyes on terms of
 

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:30.850

scale your dev and test sets would be

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:30.860
scale your dev and test sets would be
 

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:39.550
scale your dev and test sets would be
all mobile app images so the training

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:39.560
all mobile app images so the training
 

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:42.730
all mobile app images so the training
set will include two hundred thousand

from the mobile app the advantage of

00:05:59.500 --> 00:05:59.510
from the mobile app the advantage of
 

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:02.140
from the mobile app the advantage of
this way of splitting up your data to

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:02.150
this way of splitting up your data to
 

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:04.450
this way of splitting up your data to
Train dev and test is that you're now

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:04.460
Train dev and test is that you're now
 

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:06.820
Train dev and test is that you're now
aiming the target where you want it to

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:06.830
aiming the target where you want it to
 

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:09.430
aiming the target where you want it to
be you're telling your team my dev set

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:09.440
be you're telling your team my dev set
 

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:12.550
be you're telling your team my dev set
has data uploaded from the mobile app

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:12.560
has data uploaded from the mobile app
 

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:14.290
has data uploaded from the mobile app
and that's the distribution of images

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:14.300
and that's the distribution of images
 

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:15.880
and that's the distribution of images
you really care about so let's try to

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:15.890
you really care about so let's try to
 

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:17.290
you really care about so let's try to
build a machine learning system that

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:17.300
build a machine learning system that
 

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:19.690
build a machine learning system that
does really well on the mobile app

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:19.700
does really well on the mobile app
 

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:21.130
does really well on the mobile app
distribution of images

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:21.140
distribution of images
 

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:23.680
distribution of images
the disadvantage of course is that now

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:23.690
the disadvantage of course is that now
 

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:26.370
the disadvantage of course is that now
your training distribution is different

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:26.380
your training distribution is different
 

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:29.890
your training distribution is different
from your dev intensity distributions

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:29.900
from your dev intensity distributions
 

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:33.070
from your dev intensity distributions
but it turns out that this split of your

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:33.080
but it turns out that this split of your
 

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:35.950
but it turns out that this split of your
data into training dev and test will get

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:35.960
data into training dev and test will get
 

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:37.510
data into training dev and test will get
you better performance over the long

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:37.520
you better performance over the long
 

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:39.470
you better performance over the long
term and we'll discuss later

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:39.480
term and we'll discuss later
 

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:40.910
term and we'll discuss later
some specific techniques for dealing

some specific techniques for dealing
 

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:42.740
some specific techniques for dealing
with your training set coming from

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:42.750
with your training set coming from
 

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:44.540
with your training set coming from
different distributions and your dev and

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:44.550
different distributions and your dev and
 

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:48.280
different distributions and your dev and
test sets let's look at another example

country so how can you get data to train

00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:29.700
country so how can you get data to train
 

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:31.790
country so how can you get data to train
up a speech recognition system for this

00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:31.800
up a speech recognition system for this
 

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:34.400

product well maybe if work on speech

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:34.410
product well maybe if work on speech
 

00:07:34.410 --> 00:07:36.230
product well maybe if work on speech
recognition for a long time so you have

00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:36.240
recognition for a long time so you have
 

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:38.540
recognition for a long time so you have
a lot of data from other speech

00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:38.550
a lot of data from other speech
 

00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:40.700
a lot of data from other speech
recognition applications just not from a

00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:40.710

here's how you could split up your

00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:44.550
here's how you could split up your
 

00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:47.690
here's how you could split up your
training and your deaf intestines so for

00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:47.700
training and your deaf intestines so for
 

00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:49.580
training and your deaf intestines so for
a training you can take all the speech

00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:49.590
a training you can take all the speech
 

00:07:49.590 --> 00:07:51.740
a training you can take all the speech
data you have that your accumulated from

00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:51.750
data you have that your accumulated from
 

00:07:51.750 --> 00:07:53.450
data you have that your accumulated from
work on other speech problems such as

00:07:53.450 --> 00:07:53.460
work on other speech problems such as
 

00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:56.090
work on other speech problems such as
data you purchased over the years from

00:07:56.090 --> 00:07:56.100
data you purchased over the years from
 

00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:58.610

maybe you've worked on smart speakers

00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:08.510
maybe you've worked on smart speakers
 

00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:11.420
maybe you've worked on smart speakers
smart voice activated speakers so you

00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:11.430
smart voice activated speakers so you
 

00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:13.430
smart voice activated speakers so you
have some data from that maybe it worked

00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:13.440
have some data from that maybe it worked
 

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:16.340
have some data from that maybe it worked
on voice activated keyboards and so on

00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:16.350
on voice activated keyboards and so on
 

00:08:16.350 --> 00:08:18.590
on voice activated keyboards and so on
and for the sake of argument maybe you

00:08:18.590 --> 00:08:18.600
and for the sake of argument maybe you
 

00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:23.510
and for the sake of argument maybe you
have half a million utterances from all

so this distribution of data will be

00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:53.730
so this distribution of data will be
 

00:08:53.730 --> 00:08:57.160
so this distribution of data will be
very different than these on the left

00:08:57.160 --> 00:08:57.170
very different than these on the left
 

00:08:57.170 --> 00:08:59.840
very different than these on the left
but this is really the data you care

00:08:59.840 --> 00:08:59.850
but this is really the data you care
 

00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:01.280
but this is really the data you care
about because this is what you need your

00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:01.290
about because this is what you need your
 

00:09:01.290 --> 00:09:03.980
about because this is what you need your
product to do well on so this is what

00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:03.990
product to do well on so this is what
 

00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:06.020

you send your death and then test that

00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:06.030
you send your death and then test that
 

00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:10.610
you send your death and then test that
to be so what you do in this example is

00:09:10.610 --> 00:09:10.620
to be so what you do in this example is
 

00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:14.720
to be so what you do in this example is

you can take half of that and put that
 

00:09:41.610 --> 00:09:44.510
you can take half of that and put that
in the training set so then the training

00:09:44.510 --> 00:09:44.520
in the training set so then the training
 

00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:47.780
in the training set so then the training
set could be five hundred and ten

thousand dollar and so huge so up to

00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:04.770
thousand dollar and so huge so up to
 

00:10:04.770 --> 00:10:06.920
thousand dollar and so huge so up to
twenty thousand other answers may be ten

00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:06.930
twenty thousand other answers may be ten
 

00:10:06.930 --> 00:10:10.040

thousand into the test set so this would

00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:14.880
thousand into the test set so this would
 

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:16.490
thousand into the test set so this would
be another reasonable way of splitting

00:10:16.490 --> 00:10:16.500
be another reasonable way of splitting
 

00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:19.760
be another reasonable way of splitting
your data into trained deaf intense and

00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:19.770
your data into trained deaf intense and
 

00:10:19.770 --> 00:10:21.830
your data into trained deaf intense and
this gives you a much bigger training

00:10:21.830 --> 00:10:21.840
this gives you a much bigger training
 

00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:24.470
this gives you a much bigger training

activated rearview mirror data for your

00:10:29.390 --> 00:10:29.400
activated rearview mirror data for your
 

00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:32.360
activated rearview mirror data for your
training set so in this video you've

00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:32.370
training set so in this video you've
 

00:10:32.370 --> 00:10:35.000
training set so in this video you've
seen a couple examples of when allowing

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:35.010
seen a couple examples of when allowing
 

00:10:35.010 --> 00:10:37.010
seen a couple examples of when allowing
your training set data to come from a

00:10:37.010 --> 00:10:37.020
your training set data to come from a
 

00:10:37.020 --> 00:10:38.660
your training set data to come from a
different distribution then your Devon

00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:38.670
different distribution then your Devon
 

00:10:38.670 --> 00:10:40.760
different distribution then your Devon
test set allows you to have much more

00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:40.770
test set allows you to have much more
 

00:10:40.770 --> 00:10:43.070
test set allows you to have much more
