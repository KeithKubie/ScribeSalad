00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.100
We're operating LGBTQIA rights

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:04.019
into Columbia's curriculum

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:06.059
is not just a good idea.

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:07.600
It's essential.

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:10.108
Because LGBTQIA people

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.109
around the world are often used as the

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:14.339
canary in the coal mine.

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:17.789
Let's test out how strong

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.159
the arm of oppression can

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.089
be.

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.511
Let's see how far we can push

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.439
people into the shadows through

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:26.520
mass arrests.

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.260
The deregistering of LGBTQIA

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:30.510
organizations.

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:32.290
The raids.

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.529
On Pride events and community

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.870
gatherings and also

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.060
you know torture

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.490
and killing so the LGBTQOIA people

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.439
especially human rights defenders

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.810
so caring about LGBTQIA

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.090
issues is not just a matter

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.659
of placating LGBTQI

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.532
students or doing something that feels

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:53.519
good.

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.740
It is a matter of understanding

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.409
how governments have shifted

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:59.729
their discourse.

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.119
Towards populist ethno

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.369
nationalism and who

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:07.439
is most impacted by those

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:08.440
policies.

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.260
And so if we don't look at how out

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.659
LGBTIQ people are being treated

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:14.819
if we don't look at the shift in law and

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.486
public policy and if we don't look

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.689
at community based solutions.

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:20.939
Then we not only risk seeing more

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.420
violence against LGBTIQ

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.579
people but we risk misunderstanding

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.740
the growing targeting of minorities

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.220
and the attacks on democracy.
