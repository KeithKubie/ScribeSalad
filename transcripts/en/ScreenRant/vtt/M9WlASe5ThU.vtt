10 Hidden Details in Superhero Movies

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:11.290
There's nothing as satisfying to a comic book
fan as seeing a beloved comic story, characters,

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:16.260
settings, and twists adapted to the big screen.
But with so much history to draw from, it

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.710
isn't just the script that fans should look
to for hidden easter eggs, cameos, or comic

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:25.640
book references. Be warned, there may be some
spoilers in Screen Rant's 10 Hidden Details

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.250
in Superhero Movies.

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:29.520
Batman Begins

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:34.160
No fan of the Dark Knight can forget the closing
scene of Batman Begins. With Bruce Wayne having

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.579
saved Gotham City from the League of Shadows,
Jim Gordon warns him that a new criminal has

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.320
surfaced, taking Batman's emphasis on theatricality
and costume to heart. The Joker's calling

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.070
card thrilled fans, making it clear the Clown
Prince of Crime would appear in the sequel,

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:52.320
but a closer look shows that the playing card
was signed into evidence by someone named

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.210
"J. Kerr." It's a shortened version of "Joe
Kerr" - just one alias the villain has adopted

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.469
over the years, which means he may have been
tempting Batman to bring him down for longer

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.450
than fans ever knew.

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:04.450
The Avengers

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:08.899
When Thor first makes his entrance into Marvel's
first team-up, it's not in the name of teamwork:

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:13.040
simply grabbing his brother Loki from Cap
and Iron Man for a cliffside chat. The pair

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.830
of Asgardians disturb a few birds as they
land, but casual Marvel fans may not understand

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:21.930
why the same set of birds continues to circle
the scene. These are no random birds, but

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.220
Huginn and Muninn (pronounced with a y sound,
like "Hyoo-ginn and Myoo-ninn"), the ravens

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:29.260
from Norse mythology that gather information
from Earth, and return it to Odin in Asgard.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:33.060
It helps explain why Loki and Thor's father
is always kept up to speed on his sons' behaviour,

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.580
while giving fans yet another easy-to-miss
easter egg to search for in future films.

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:39.580
Man of Steel

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:44.320
For Batman V Superman and his Justice League
universe, Zack Snyder decided he needed an

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.780
older, battle-hardened Batman who'd been fighting
crime for years already. But it was the special

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.880
effects team on Man of Steel who first had
the idea of showing Batman was already a pop

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:57.299
culture icon in Metropolis. When Zod first
discovers his heat vision in the movie's final

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:02.500
battle, he causes a skyscraper to fall apart
around Superman. It's just then that a poster

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:07.040
in one of the cubicles can be seen, reading:
Keep Calm and Call Batman. He may not have

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:11.569
planted the Easter egg himself, but Snyder
took the advice to heart.

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:12.569
Captain America

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:16.950
The Captain America series made actor Chris
Evans a household name, and forever synonymous

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.590
with the star-spangled hero. But his entry
into superhero cinema wasn't totally smooth.

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:26.590
Before Cap, Evans appeared as the Human Torch
in Fox's Fantastic Four series. Evans won

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:30.760
over more fans than the films, so few complained
when he was chosen to play another Marvel

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:35.629
hero. But the studio couldn't resist a joke
at Johnny Storm's expense, including a version

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:40.040
of the original Human Torch costume in the
World Exposition visited in The First Avenger's

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:41.579
opening act.

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:43.329
The Amazing Spider-Man 2

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:47.090
The movie may be remembered as the one which
ended star Andrew Garfield's time as Peter

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:51.579
Parker, but The Amazing Spider-Man 2 had an
even bigger story to tackle: the death of

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:56.371
Gwen Stacy. While casual fans enjoyed the
chemistry between the two lead actors, comic

00:02:56.371 --> 00:03:01.409
book fans knew that Spider-Man's fight sequence
with Green Goblin was going to end in tragedy.

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:05.790
Gwen's death was every bit as tragic and unforgettable
as fans would have hoped, with an easter egg

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:10.840
every bit as fitting. As the clock's gears
hit the ground, the hands spin to read 1:21.

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.199
As in Issue #121, in which "The Night Gwen
Stacy Died."

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:15.859
Marvel Creator Cameos

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:19.689
These days, the average moviegoer might think
that superheroes find "real" success on the

00:03:19.689 --> 00:03:23.790
big screen, leaving the artists and writers
who actually created their best stories out

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:27.879
in the cold. While that's partly true, Marvel
Studios has been sure to include the creators

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:32.299
in the fun. Audiences got to see writer J.
Michael Straczinsky learn that it's easier

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:37.659
to move Thor's hammer on the page than in
person, Legendary writer and artist Walt Simonson

00:03:37.659 --> 00:03:42.090
feasting next to Lady Sif, and even writer
Ed Brubaker watching his Winter Soldier brought

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:44.980
to life in front of him.

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:46.939
Guardians Of The Galaxy

00:03:46.939 --> 00:03:50.540
Director James Gunn's space opera may include
more Easter Eggs and nods to the comics than

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:54.639
any Marvel film before, but it's the one message
in the film that we can't figure out that

00:03:54.639 --> 00:03:59.260
seems the most important. Whenever a new planet
or location is introduced, a set of coordinates

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:03.660
appear alongside it. Most point to actual
locations in the Andromeda Galaxy, but when

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:08.279
the villain's ship is first shown, the string
of characters means something else entirely.

00:04:08.279 --> 00:04:12.089
Swap out the numbers for the corresponding
letters of the alphabet, and we're told that

00:04:12.089 --> 00:04:16.810
"THIS IS MOMS CANCER". Since Star-Lord's human
mother died of cancer, it sounds like even

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:21.010
more plot twists are on the way, but your
guess is as good as ours.

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:23.210
Thor: The Dark World

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:26.830
Even if the brilliant Dr. Erik Selvig was
being mind-controlled by Loki through much

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:31.250
of The Avengers, it was his cosmic knowledge
which helped them save the day. But it came

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:36.200
at a price. By the time Thor: the Dark World
came around, Selvig was institutionalized,

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:40.740
obsessed with the glimpse he'd gotten of Marvel's
larger universe. As a result, his chalkboard

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:45.220
of notes packs plenty of easter eggs. Comic
writers Craig Kyle and Christopher Yost get

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:50.169
a shout-out for their X-Men and X-Force storylines,
while Dr. Selvig has apparently deduced that

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:55.139
the MCU, like the Marvel Comic continuity,
is set in the "616 Universe." There's also

00:04:55.139 --> 00:04:59.030
a nod to The Crossroads, the nexus of alien
dimensions likely to appear in the Doctor

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:03.130
Strange fiction, and The Fault, a rift in
space that has played a major role for both

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:07.860
the Guardians of the Galaxy and The Inhumans.
They may be the scribblings of a mad man,

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:10.889
but he's onto something.

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:11.889
Iron Man

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:16.439
There was a time when the Marvel Cinematic
Universe was just a dream, revealed as a hard-to-believe

00:05:16.439 --> 00:05:20.850
goal for the studio in a post credits scene
for Iron Man. Nick Fury wasn't lying, and

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:25.390
The Avengers began to form soon after, with
Iron Man 2 even using Captain America's deconstructed

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:29.500
shield in a gag. Since fans knew to look for
it, the shield's appearance doesn't qualify

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:33.909
as a secret. That honor goes to the previous
film, when the same shield appeared on Tony's

00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:37.610
workbench - but even those who noticed it
couldn't have guessed it was actually a sign

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:40.419
of the shared universe to come.

00:05:40.419 --> 00:05:41.419
Man of Steel

00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:45.479
Zack Snyder made no secret of his love for
the TV series Smallville, even calling on

00:05:45.479 --> 00:05:49.949
a few cast members to appear in Man of Steel.
But the references didn't stop there. When

00:05:49.949 --> 00:05:54.050
a teenage Clark is bullied by a group of football
players, it's shown to take take place in

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:58.469
front of Sullivan's Truck &amp; Tartar Repair
- a direct reference to Chloe Sullivan, the

00:05:58.469 --> 00:06:02.729
fan-favorite Smallville character created
solely for the TV series, but included - at

00:06:02.729 --> 00:06:05.969
least in name - in Snyder's re-imagined origin.

00:06:05.969 --> 00:06:09.699
