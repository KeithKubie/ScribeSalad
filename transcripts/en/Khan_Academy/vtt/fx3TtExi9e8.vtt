00:00:00.808 --> 00:00:04.111
- [Instructor] Let's say that
we have a random variable x.

00:00:04.111 --> 00:00:05.904
Maybe it represents the height

00:00:05.904 --> 00:00:09.218
of a randomly selected person
walking out of the mall

00:00:09.218 --> 00:00:10.822
or something like that

00:00:10.822 --> 00:00:15.346
and right over here, we have
its probability distribution

00:00:15.346 --> 00:00:18.159
and I've drawn it as a bell curve

00:00:18.159 --> 00:00:20.244
as a normal distribution right over here

00:00:20.244 --> 00:00:21.933
but it could have many other distributions

00:00:21.933 --> 00:00:23.976
but for the visualization sake,

00:00:23.976 --> 00:00:25.852
it's a normal one in this example

00:00:25.852 --> 00:00:29.370
and I've also drawn the
mean of this distribution

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:30.452
right over here

00:00:30.452 --> 00:00:33.501
and I've also drawn one standard
deviation above the mean

00:00:33.501 --> 00:00:36.684
and one standard deviation below the mean.

00:00:36.684 --> 00:00:38.441
What we're going to do in this video

00:00:38.441 --> 00:00:41.101
is think about how does this distribution

00:00:41.101 --> 00:00:42.814
and in particular, how does the mean

00:00:42.814 --> 00:00:45.471
and the standard deviation get affected

00:00:45.471 --> 00:00:49.100
if we were to add to this random variable

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.651
or if we were to scale
this random variable?

00:00:52.651 --> 00:00:54.979
So let's first think
about what would happen

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:57.560
if we have another random variable

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:01.611
which is equal to let's
call this random variable y

00:01:01.611 --> 00:01:06.255
which is equal to whatever
the random variable x is

00:01:06.255 --> 00:01:08.551
and we're going to add a constant.

00:01:08.551 --> 00:01:10.675
So let's say we add,

00:01:10.675 --> 00:01:12.718
so we're gonna add some constant here.

00:01:12.718 --> 00:01:13.779
I'll do a lowercase k.

00:01:13.779 --> 00:01:14.992
This is not a random variable.

00:01:14.992 --> 00:01:15.864
This is a constant.

00:01:15.864 --> 00:01:17.089
It could be the number 10.

00:01:17.089 --> 00:01:19.298
So if these are random heights

00:01:19.298 --> 00:01:21.088
of people walking out of the mall,

00:01:21.088 --> 00:01:22.924
well, you're just gonna add
10 inches to their height

00:01:22.924 --> 00:01:23.757
for some reason.

00:01:23.757 --> 00:01:24.677
Maybe you wanna figure out,

00:01:24.677 --> 00:01:27.657
well, the distribution of
people's heights with helmets on

00:01:27.657 --> 00:01:30.764
or plumed hats or whatever it might be.

00:01:30.764 --> 00:01:32.120
How would that affect,

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:36.031
how would the mean of y and
the standard deviation of y

00:01:36.031 --> 00:01:37.031
relate to x?

00:01:38.809 --> 00:01:40.571
So we could visualize that.

00:01:40.571 --> 00:01:43.836
So what the distribution
of y would look like.

00:01:43.836 --> 00:01:46.122
So instead of this,

00:01:46.122 --> 00:01:48.008
instead of the center of the distribution,

00:01:48.008 --> 00:01:51.613
instead of the mean here
being right at this point,

00:01:51.613 --> 00:01:53.649
it's going to be shifted up by k.

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:55.689
In fact, we can shift.

00:01:55.689 --> 00:01:59.617
The entire distribution
would be shifted to the right

00:01:59.617 --> 00:02:01.367
by k in this example.

00:02:02.589 --> 00:02:04.434
Maybe k is quite large.

00:02:04.434 --> 00:02:07.622
Maybe it looks something like that.

00:02:07.622 --> 00:02:11.789
This is my distribution for
my random variable y here

00:02:13.704 --> 00:02:15.594
and you can see that the distribution

00:02:15.594 --> 00:02:18.297
has just shifted to the right by k.

00:02:18.297 --> 00:02:21.945
So we have moved to the right by k.

00:02:21.945 --> 00:02:24.207
We would have moved to
the left if k was negative

00:02:24.207 --> 00:02:25.929
or if we were subtracting k

00:02:25.929 --> 00:02:28.463
and so this clearly changes the mean.

00:02:28.463 --> 00:02:31.942
The mean is going to now be k larger.

00:02:31.942 --> 00:02:33.749
So we can write that down.

00:02:33.749 --> 00:02:38.478
We can say that the mean
of our random variable y

00:02:38.478 --> 00:02:40.645
is equal to the mean of x,

00:02:42.927 --> 00:02:47.094
the mean of x of our
random variable x plus k,

00:02:48.341 --> 00:02:49.569
plus k.

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:51.204
You see that right over here

00:02:51.204 --> 00:02:53.842
but has the standard deviation changed?

00:02:53.842 --> 00:02:56.291
Well, remember, standard
deviation is a way

00:02:56.291 --> 00:02:59.563
of measuring typical spread from the mean

00:02:59.563 --> 00:03:01.286
and that won't change.

00:03:01.286 --> 00:03:03.703
So for our random variable x,

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:07.353
this is, this length right over here

00:03:07.353 --> 00:03:09.520
is one standard deviation.

00:03:10.543 --> 00:03:12.323
Well, that's also going to be the same

00:03:12.323 --> 00:03:14.952
as one standard deviation here.

00:03:14.952 --> 00:03:17.206
This is one standard deviation here.

00:03:17.206 --> 00:03:18.442
This is going to be the same

00:03:18.442 --> 00:03:23.250
as our standard deviation
for our random variable y

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:27.083
and so we can say the
standard deviation of y,

00:03:27.974 --> 00:03:29.155
of our random variable y,

00:03:29.155 --> 00:03:33.322
is equal to the standard deviation
of our random variable x.

00:03:34.529 --> 00:03:37.840
So if you just add to a random variable,

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.787
it would change the mean but
not the standard deviation.

00:03:40.787 --> 00:03:42.343
You see it visually here.

00:03:42.343 --> 00:03:45.084
Now, what if you were to
scale a random variable?

00:03:45.084 --> 00:03:47.374
So what if I have another random variable,

00:03:47.374 --> 00:03:50.043
I don't know, let's call it z

00:03:50.043 --> 00:03:53.932
and let's say z is equal to some constant,

00:03:53.932 --> 00:03:55.682
some constant times x

00:03:57.277 --> 00:03:59.731
and so remember, this isn't,
the k is not a random variable.

00:03:59.731 --> 00:04:00.564
It's just gonna be a number.

00:04:00.564 --> 00:04:02.065
It could be say the number two.

00:04:02.065 --> 00:04:03.973
Well, let's think about what would happen.

00:04:03.973 --> 00:04:08.864
So let me redraw the distribution
for our random variable x.

00:04:08.864 --> 00:04:10.786
So let's see, if k were two,

00:04:10.786 --> 00:04:12.883
what would happen is is
with this distribution

00:04:12.883 --> 00:04:13.904
would be scaled out.

00:04:13.904 --> 00:04:15.594
It would be stretched out by two

00:04:15.594 --> 00:04:17.844
and since the area always has to be one,

00:04:17.844 --> 00:04:19.761
it would actually be flattened down

00:04:19.761 --> 00:04:24.047
by a scale of two as well so
it still has the same area.

00:04:24.047 --> 00:04:27.773
So I can do that with my
little drawing tool here.

00:04:27.773 --> 00:04:31.940
Let me try to, first I'm
going to stretch it out by,

00:04:32.844 --> 00:04:35.918
whoops, first actually
I'll just make it shorter

00:04:35.918 --> 00:04:37.944
by a factor of two

00:04:37.944 --> 00:04:42.640
but more importantly, it is
going to be stretched out

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:44.438
by a factor of two.

00:04:44.438 --> 00:04:46.466
So let me align the axes here

00:04:46.466 --> 00:04:48.554
so that we can appreciate this.

00:04:48.554 --> 00:04:51.717
So it's going to look something like this.

00:04:51.717 --> 00:04:53.924
It's going to look something like this

00:04:53.924 --> 00:04:56.664
when you scale the random variable.

00:04:56.664 --> 00:04:58.674
This is what the distribution

00:04:58.674 --> 00:05:01.389
of our random variable
z is going to look like.

00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:04.949
I'll do it in the z's
color so that it's clear

00:05:04.949 --> 00:05:06.542
and so you can see two things.

00:05:06.542 --> 00:05:09.608
One, the mean for sure shifted.

00:05:09.608 --> 00:05:12.775
The mean here for sure got pushed out.

00:05:13.735 --> 00:05:16.596
It definitely got scaled up

00:05:16.596 --> 00:05:21.225
but also, we see that the
standard deviations got scaled,

00:05:21.225 --> 00:05:24.785
that the standard deviation
right over here of z,

00:05:24.785 --> 00:05:27.129
that this is a, this has been scaled,

00:05:27.129 --> 00:05:29.212
it actually turns out
that it's been scaled

00:05:29.212 --> 00:05:30.723
by a factor of k.

00:05:30.723 --> 00:05:33.180
So this is going to be equal to k

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:36.972
times the standard deviation
of our random variable x

00:05:36.972 --> 00:05:40.137
and it turns out that
our mean right over here,

00:05:40.137 --> 00:05:42.426
so let me write that too,

00:05:42.426 --> 00:05:45.772
that our mean of our random variable z

00:05:45.772 --> 00:05:47.612
is going to be equal to,

00:05:47.612 --> 00:05:50.263
that's also going to be scaled up,

00:05:50.263 --> 00:05:52.960
times or it's gonna be k times

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:55.793
the mean of our random variable x.

00:05:57.251 --> 00:05:59.494
So the big takeaways here,

00:05:59.494 --> 00:06:02.072
if you have one random variable

00:06:02.072 --> 00:06:04.561
that's constructed by adding a constant

00:06:04.561 --> 00:06:05.870
to another random variable,

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:08.891
it's going to shift the
mean by that constant

00:06:08.891 --> 00:06:11.386
but it's not going to affect
the standard deviation.

00:06:11.386 --> 00:06:12.897
If you try to scale,

00:06:12.897 --> 00:06:16.254
if you multiply one random
variable to get another one

00:06:16.254 --> 00:06:17.548
by some constant

00:06:17.548 --> 00:06:20.714
then that's going to affect
both the standard deviation,

00:06:20.714 --> 00:06:21.982
it's gonna scale that,

00:06:21.982 --> 00:06:24.815
and it's going to affect the mean.
