00:00:01.234 --> 00:00:04.170
Well, folks, we are headed into
halftime on an absolute blowout.

00:00:04.637 --> 00:00:06.506
- Bill?
- I can't help but wonder

00:00:06.539 --> 00:00:08.574
if the league-mandated
sensitivity training

00:00:08.607 --> 00:00:12.478
- hasn't taken away their edge.
- Now I've seen some bad
basketball before

00:00:12.511 --> 00:00:15.015
but I don't even recognize the
team that's in front of me
right now.

00:00:15.481 --> 00:00:17.784
Goddamn, that seminar
really screwed y'all up.

00:00:17.817 --> 00:00:20.119
Some of us found
the seminar very enlightening.

00:00:20.152 --> 00:00:21.521
Oh yeah, you enlightened
all right.

00:00:21.554 --> 00:00:23.656
As in they lightening yo ass
up on the court.

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:25.391
What the hell is wrong
with you guys?

00:00:25.424 --> 00:00:27.126
Well, for one thing,
when you keep asking us

00:00:27.159 --> 00:00:28.528
what's wrong with you guys

00:00:28.561 --> 00:00:30.663
it feels like you're
imposing a gender on us.

00:00:30.696 --> 00:00:32.265
And some players
might have a hard time

00:00:32.298 --> 00:00:35.201
focusing in the face of
a constant microaggression.

00:00:35.234 --> 00:00:36.803
I'd love to see
a little aggression

00:00:36.836 --> 00:00:38.671
'cause right now
everybody's out there

00:00:38.704 --> 00:00:40.540
playing like a bunch of bitches.

00:00:40.573 --> 00:00:43.142
Coach, the word bitches
is so offensive.

00:00:43.175 --> 00:00:44.410
I don't even know
where to begin.

00:00:44.443 --> 00:00:46.212
What the fuck are you
talking about?

00:00:46.245 --> 00:00:48.648
The word bitches
is misogynistic.

00:00:48.681 --> 00:00:50.583
It's like you're saying
we're playing like women,

00:00:50.616 --> 00:00:52.685
implying that women aren't
as good at basketball.

00:00:52.718 --> 00:00:54.153
That's exactly what I'm saying.

00:00:54.186 --> 00:00:56.456
- That's sexist.
- And also not true

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:57.757
when you compare
the fundamentals

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:59.325
of the NBA and the WNBA players.

00:00:59.358 --> 00:01:01.527
Personally I model my game
after Sheryl Swoops.

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:03.429
I've always thought of myself
as more of a Diana Taurasi. 

00:01:03.462 --> 00:01:09.635
- I'm a Tina Charles all day.
- So ya'll happy being bitches?

00:01:09.668 --> 00:01:10.703
Do y'all hear yourselves right
now?

00:01:10.736 --> 00:01:13.172
Hey. Knock knock.
Hi, how are you doing? Coach,

00:01:13.205 --> 00:01:15.241
I was reading some numbers
and Darren over there,

00:01:15.274 --> 00:01:17.310
turns out that he's much more
effective as a power forward

00:01:17.343 --> 00:01:20.213
instead of a center
in the first half.

00:01:20.246 --> 00:01:24.584
Boy, if you don't get your
Moneyball homeschooled Dexter's
Laboratory

00:01:24.617 --> 00:01:27.520
looking ass out
of my locker room...
- Don't cry, don't cry.

00:01:28.587 --> 00:01:30.223
- Thank you.
- What is this?

00:01:30.256 --> 00:01:31.491
What did you just
give my players?

00:01:31.524 --> 00:01:33.426
That is something
I call V Sauce 3.

00:01:33.459 --> 00:01:36.295
It's something I'm working on
that helps enhance mid-game

00:01:36.328 --> 00:01:38.631
performance, it's chock full
of electrolytes and you...

00:01:39.532 --> 00:01:40.934
... put it on vegetables.

00:01:40.967 --> 00:01:43.837
Coach, it's just to preserve our
energy. 
- Yes. It's my special sauce.

00:01:44.703 --> 00:01:47.607
Hell no! You don't come
into a room full of men

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.642
and start offering your special
sauce.

00:01:49.675 --> 00:01:51.878
- Get your ass out of here.
- Wow.

00:01:51.911 --> 00:01:54.147
- Now you're being homophobic.
- I'm not homophobic.

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.915
That shit sounded
suspect. Anyway,

00:01:55.948 --> 00:01:57.149
remember what got us here.

00:01:57.183 --> 00:02:01.621
Ball control, ball control -
when they come to the middle.

00:02:01.654 --> 00:02:05.158
I want y'all to hit them
with hard D. What

00:02:05.191 --> 00:02:09.896
the hell are y'all looking at?
- That was wasteful.

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.764
Sure the city of Flint
would have liked that water.

00:02:11.797 --> 00:02:13.165
Oh you know
what I would love?

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:17.403
I would love Darren to
goddamn box somebody out and
grab a rebound.

00:02:17.436 --> 00:02:19.505
The way you play it, we
stand about as much chance

00:02:19.538 --> 00:02:22.241
as a one legged man
in the ass kicking contest.

00:02:22.274 --> 00:02:23.309
- Ableist 
- Hey Rob!

00:02:23.342 --> 00:02:24.911
You close out on your man!
You're out there moving

00:02:24.944 --> 00:02:27.213
- like somebody's grandaddy. 
- Ageist.

00:02:27.246 --> 00:02:30.883
Terrence, you out there playing
like a poor man's James Harden.

00:02:30.916 --> 00:02:31.584
Classist.

00:02:31.617 --> 00:02:33.252
I can't believe this the shit

00:02:33.285 --> 00:02:34.787
I've got to deal with
in the finals.

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:36.923
It's already bad enough
my best player is a white boy.

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.793
Actually coach.
I identify as a black man.

00:02:41.694 --> 00:02:47.233
- Nigga, what? 
- Lost your damn mind.

00:02:47.266 --> 00:02:48.835
Come on guys. It's our struggle.

00:02:49.668 --> 00:02:52.438
Haven't we been through enough?
