00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:03.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:24.970
&gt;&gt; Joan Weeks: I'd like to
welcome you to the African

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:28.060
and Middle East Division
at the Library of Congress

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:30.420
and to our noontime lecture series

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:36.170
with today's program entitled
the Sultan's Gift, Book Diplomacy

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:40.600 position:56%
in the Hamidian Period by Guy Burak.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.830
And it's sponsored by the Near
East section of the African

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:45.570
and Middle East Division.

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.070
I'm Joan Weeks, I'm head
of the Near East section

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:49.930
and the Turkish specialist.

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:54.560
And on behalf of all my colleagues
and especially Dr. Mary Jane Deeb,

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:57.040
chief of the division, she
may join us in a little bit

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.570
with some of our guests today.

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:02.570
I'd like to extend a very
warm welcome to everyone.

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:06.750
But before we start today's program
and introduce our speaker I'd

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.820
like to give you a brief overview
of our division and its resources.

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.520
I know many of you've heard
this before many times,

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.350
but we also have some
visitors with us.

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:18.650
In the hopes that you'll come back

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:22.750
and use our beautiful reading
room for your research.

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:27.580
This division is comprised
of three sections that build

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:31.510
and serve the collections to
researchers from around the world.

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:37.270
We cover 75 countries and
more than two dozen languages.

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:43.660 position:56%
The Africa section covers all of
the countries of sub-Saharan Africa.

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:48.720
The Hebraic section is responsible
for Judaica and Hebraica worldwide.

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.000
And the Near East section covers
all of the Arab countries,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.870
including North Africa, Turkey,
Turkic Central Asia, Iran,

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:03.040
Afghanistan, the Muslims in western
China, Russia and the Balkans,

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:06.890
and the peoples of the Caucasus.

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.620
After the program we invite
you to fill in the little forms

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:12.070
that you see, our little survey.

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:17.700 position:56%
We'd like to know how the program
-- what you liked about the program.

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.100
And you can leave these
forms at the reference desk

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.790 position:56%
at the back in the little container.

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.250
And we'd also like to invite you
to ask questions during our program

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.460
after this, but this
program is being videotaped.

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:37.570
So if you ask questions you're
implicitly giving your permission

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:40.700
for us to be recorded.

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.430
Now I'd like to introduce
our speaker.

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:48.130
Guy Burak is the Middle Eastern
and Islamic studies librarian

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:52.310
at New York University,
Elmer Holmes Library.

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:56.770
He is the author of The Second
Formation of Islamic Law,

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:00.740
it was published by Cambridge
University Press in 2015.

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:05.750
And he publishes regularly on
Ottoman and Islamic history.

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:11.030
He did his PhD at NYU on
Ottoman legal history and was

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:16.140
in the Islamic legal studies
program at Harvard University.

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:21.420 position:56%
He began working at NYU on February
2013, so he's a relatively newcomer.

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:26.520 position:56%
But he seems to do it all reference,
acquisitions, and cataloging.

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:31.530
And one of his many projects at NYU

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:36.650 position:56%
and his most recent endeavors
involves cataloguing the Abdul Hamid

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:39.120
collections at NYU.

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:43.620
And this is a very special
collection that was presented

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:48.340
by Abram Hewitt to the
Library of Congress.

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:53.420
We've got over almost 400
books, it has also been a gift

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:58.350
to the British Library, as
well as to New York University.

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:01.890
So without further ado I'll
let Guy Barak tell us all

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:04.050
about that collection
and his work with it.

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:05.380
Thank you.

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:12.070
&gt;&gt; Guy Burak: And good afternoon,
I have notes but I just speak.

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:15.770
And thank you Joan for the
invitation to be here, to talk

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:18.930
and share with you and my
experience with this project.

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:23.740
And it has been and it is a real
pleasure to be at the Library

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:27.410
of Congress in general and
specifically to be here

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:36.000
with this project that I have
been working on for quite a while.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.660
And it's very much a work
in progress and I hope

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:44.920
that it will be the beginning
of a conversation between NYU

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:47.960
and the Library of Congress and
possibly many other libraries

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:51.530
about this collection and
what we can do with this

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:57.810
and similar collections that
we have in our institutions.

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:02.330
So this all started -- this
collection has a very long history

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:05.340
and I'll tell you a little
bit about in a few minutes.

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:09.560
And my history with this
connection is very, very recent.

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:18.580
A year ago or slightly more than a
year ago I got an e-mail from Hamid

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:23.890
and Waleed from the British
Library and he asked me

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:28.540
about do you know something
about the books that NYU received

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:30.690
from Abdulhamid the Second.

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:34.220
And I hadn't heard
about these books,

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:40.260
I mean I'm monotonous I did
my PhD at NYU, no one told me

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.240
about these things, I didn't know.

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:49.680
And so I contacted our
university archivist, Janet Bunde.

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:54.950
In general, I should say that
this is a collaborative project

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:59.850
with the university archives at
NYU and the special collections.

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:03.650
So I should mention my colleagues
Janet Bunde from the archives

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:06.660
and Charlotte Priddle from
the special collections.

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:11.140
They've all been extremely
supportive and helpful and in fact,

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:13.040
instrumental in this project.

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:17.750
So I contact Janet and ask her do
you know nothing about these books

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:19.590
or do you know anything
about these gifts?

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:21.840
Are there documents in the archive?

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:24.960
And a few days later she
came back and said yes,

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:27.490
actually we have things
in the accession books

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:29.090
and these are accession books

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:31.620
and these are the entries
in the accession books.

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:36.210
And at that time we thought
-- we just assumed okay,

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:39.420
we have the accession books, we
know that we received the books,

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:44.780
but we probably lost them
in one of the renovations

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:48.480
since the 19th century,
the late 19th century

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:53.200
when we received the books.

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:59.200
So we just -- but we also
found from the accession books

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:01.710
that we received the books
through Abram Hewitt.

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:05.360
So basically, there are two
main protagonists to this story.

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:07.870
One is obviously of
Abdulhamid the Second

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:12.530
and perhaps the most famous
sultan of the 19 century,

00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:15.580
definitely the second
half of the 19th century.

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:17.680
And the second was Abram S. Hewitt.

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:20.220
At the time he was
the representative

00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:24.570
and New York's representative
to the house.

00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:27.020
And later he became
the mayor of New York.

00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:29.590
Apparently at that
time Abdulhamid thought

00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:35.270
that he would become the
President of the United States,

00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:37.190
what actually did not happen.

00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:46.420
But in 1884 Hewitt visited
Istanbul and had several meetings

00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:48.930
with Abdulhamid the Second.

00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:55.040
And in one of these meetings Hewitt
presented with this collection,

00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:59.650
with the collection that
the Library of Congress have

00:07:59.650 --> 00:08:05.350
and the collection that we have.

00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:12.630
Interestingly, in 1940 Hewitt's
son wrote a very interesting piece

00:08:12.630 --> 00:08:16.920
for the New Yorker and I'm
also grateful for Janet

00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:19.280
for pointing this out to me.

00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:24.030
And the piece is titled
The Sultan's Gift

00:08:24.030 --> 00:08:26.650
and this is the piece
from the New Yorker.

00:08:26.650 --> 00:08:29.900
And it actually tells some
very interesting stories,

00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:33.490
very interesting details
about this collection.

00:08:33.490 --> 00:08:39.210
And we hear the numbers
and Hewitt's son says

00:08:39.210 --> 00:08:45.900
that his father received 395
books from Abdulhamid the Second.

00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:48.410
He also says that when
Hewitt came back

00:08:48.410 --> 00:08:54.400
to the US he sent Abdulhamid
some gilded pens

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:57.850
and 10,000 Virginia cigarettes.

00:08:57.850 --> 00:08:59.180
So it's a very cool piece

00:08:59.180 --> 00:09:03.070 position:56%
if you have time you should actually
take the time and take a look at it.

00:09:03.070 --> 00:09:09.030
But so that was the
first clue we had.

00:09:09.030 --> 00:09:14.310
Then a few days ago, less
than a week ago actually,

00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:17.580
Professor [inaudible]
from Boston University

00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:24.870
who actually has seen the set
at NYU sent me this document.

00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:30.120
This is a document from the Ottoman
archives talking about the gift.

00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:38.570
It was issued by the [inaudible],
the Ministry of Education

00:09:38.570 --> 00:09:40.480
or something along those lines.

00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:43.510
And what is interesting
in this story --

00:09:43.510 --> 00:09:46.450
from this document is that it
completely changed my perception,

00:09:46.450 --> 00:09:50.540
not completely, but it changed my
perception of history of the gift.

00:09:50.540 --> 00:09:57.450 position:56%
Before I saw this document I assumed
that Hewitt received one set,

00:09:57.450 --> 00:10:01.480
gave it to the Library of Congress
and then Abdulhamid was so excited

00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:06.410
by the reception or
by the enthusiasm

00:10:06.410 --> 00:10:12.930
that he gave Hewitt a second set.

00:10:12.930 --> 00:10:15.920
And for some reason apparently
because he didn't want

00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:20.610
to pay taxes he gave
this collection to NYU.

00:10:20.610 --> 00:10:22.680
But this document tells
a very different story.

00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:28.990
This document apparently Hewitt
was presented with two sets,

00:10:28.990 --> 00:10:35.930 position:56%
one from what they call the American
[inaudible] that is the Library

00:10:35.930 --> 00:10:40.200
of Congress and the second
was a personal set or a set

00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:47.810
that was intended to be or to be a
personal set for Monsieur Hewitt.

00:10:47.810 --> 00:10:53.190
It actually describes
what you Abdulhamid wanted

00:10:53.190 --> 00:10:54.490
to do with the books.

00:10:54.490 --> 00:10:59.010
He specifically explains
how they should be bound

00:10:59.010 --> 00:11:01.270
and how they should be inscribed.

00:11:01.270 --> 00:11:04.010
He also said -- we also learned

00:11:04.010 --> 00:11:09.570
from this document the
scope of this collection.

00:11:09.570 --> 00:11:13.600
Basically, it's the connection
should include all the books

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:19.760
that were published presumably
in Istanbul or in the core lands

00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:28.950
of the empire from Abdulhamid's
accession to the throne in 1876.

00:11:28.950 --> 00:11:32.520
There are two copies
of this document.

00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:38.960
This is one, this is the second
and they were issued in 1884,

00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:46.530
the same date when the books
were actually given to Hewitt.

00:11:46.530 --> 00:11:51.610
So this is how the books look
like and one of the things

00:11:51.610 --> 00:11:56.990
that is actually interesting
about the NYU set is

00:11:56.990 --> 00:11:59.190 position:56%
that it remained pretty much intact.

00:11:59.190 --> 00:12:04.150
I mean some books are in
better shapes than others.

00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:09.790 position:56%
But we still have the physical books
bound and I think that the Library

00:12:09.790 --> 00:12:14.250
of Congress have two or three
books that remained intact.

00:12:14.250 --> 00:12:17.340
But we still have the
physical object

00:12:17.340 --> 00:12:24.390
and they are extremely brittle and
the paper is incredibly acidic,

00:12:24.390 --> 00:12:28.790
especially the books
published in Arabic.

00:12:28.790 --> 00:12:34.640
I don't know why were
printed on a much better paper

00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:40.440
and I don't have a good
explanation why this is the case,

00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:45.440
but this is how it is.

00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:48.700
And so among the -- so, so far

00:12:48.700 --> 00:12:55.310 position:56%
at NYU we have catalogued mostly the
Turkish or the Ottoman Turkish part

00:12:55.310 --> 00:12:59.210
and we are about or we
just started working

00:12:59.210 --> 00:13:02.690
on the Persian and the Arabic.

00:13:02.690 --> 00:13:07.890
And most of the collection out
of the 400 titles in our books

00:13:07.890 --> 00:13:12.260
in Ottoman and the rest are
in Persian and in Arabic.

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:19.110 position:56%
So for the Ottoman collection you
can find books by the usual suspects

00:13:19.110 --> 00:13:21.530
or what I call the usual suspects.

00:13:21.530 --> 00:13:27.700
Books by Ahmed Cevdet Pasha,
the famous jurist and scholar

00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:31.910
and also a Ministry of Justice

00:13:31.910 --> 00:13:38.420
and an incredibly important
reformer of the 19th century.

00:13:38.420 --> 00:13:42.080
So we have most of his
works in this collection,

00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:45.740
including the recently published
the Mecelle, [inaudible],

00:13:45.740 --> 00:13:55.680
the Ottoman Legal Code published
in the mid 60's or the late 60's.

00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:59.880
There are also books by Ahmed
Midhat Efendi, the famous author

00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:05.650
and novelist of the
19th century who was one

00:14:05.650 --> 00:14:08.070
of his works was recently
published --

00:14:08.070 --> 00:14:10.560
a translation of one of his work
was recently published in English.

00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:17.190
So this is how a book by
Midhat Efendi looks like.

00:14:17.190 --> 00:14:18.490
What is interesting
about these books

00:14:18.490 --> 00:14:23.590
and this actually raises some
questions, cataloguing questions

00:14:23.590 --> 00:14:26.690 position:56%
because the books, the
collection, what is very interesting

00:14:26.690 --> 00:14:30.790
about the collection even if
the books are well-known is

00:14:30.790 --> 00:14:33.410
that it raises some interesting
questions about the book,

00:14:33.410 --> 00:14:37.830
the history of the book in
the early Hamidian period.

00:14:37.830 --> 00:14:43.540
And some of the questions that
we are confronted when we see,

00:14:43.540 --> 00:14:47.930
I mean those title pages raise
some very interesting questions

00:14:47.930 --> 00:14:49.260
in terms of cataloguing.

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:53.970
So for instance, there was
this very interesting practice

00:14:53.970 --> 00:14:58.430
that you had the publisher,
but then or a printer,

00:14:58.430 --> 00:15:01.180
but then a publisher
bought the printed books

00:15:01.180 --> 00:15:03.290
and just stamped them like this.

00:15:03.290 --> 00:15:06.580
So it's not part of the title page

00:15:06.580 --> 00:15:12.250
and for most part most
records have tended

00:15:12.250 --> 00:15:15.750
to take the printer
as the publisher.

00:15:15.750 --> 00:15:21.840
But there we have this interesting
practice and they're all kind

00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:25.460
of practices that we see when we
look at this collection closely.

00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:32.340
And because I'm not an expert
in Hamidian book history,

00:15:32.340 --> 00:15:38.320
so I still don't know what to
do with these practices and how

00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:41.330
to reflect them in our records.

00:15:41.330 --> 00:15:45.110
But I just thought it would be
interesting to point this out.

00:15:45.110 --> 00:15:50.410
There are also quite a few
translations from a wide range

00:15:50.410 --> 00:15:58.720
of languages from Russian to
French to English and German.

00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:05.080
This is a translation of
Alexandre Dumas [inaudible],

00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:10.130
but we have a very wide range
of books, mostly novels,

00:16:10.130 --> 00:16:16.830
but also military manuals published
in the early Hamidian period.

00:16:17.940 --> 00:16:19.790
There are also quite
a few lithographs.

00:16:19.790 --> 00:16:24.130
Most of the books are movable and
were printed using movable type,

00:16:24.130 --> 00:16:25.650
but there are quite
a few lithographs.

00:16:25.650 --> 00:16:28.580
And what is interesting
about those lithographs is

00:16:28.580 --> 00:16:31.560
that they are usually books
that are almost ephemera.

00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:39.200
They are textbooks, they
are manuals for engineers

00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:43.360
and railroad builders
and all those things.

00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:48.070 position:56%
And I should say that this it's nice

00:16:48.070 --> 00:16:50.540
because it supplements
a very nice collection

00:16:50.540 --> 00:16:54.380
of lithographs that we have at NYU.

00:16:54.380 --> 00:16:57.040
And covering lithographs
basically from the [inaudible]

00:16:57.040 --> 00:16:58.840
to the Indian subcontinent.

00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:05.530
So this collection fills
a very interesting gap

00:17:05.530 --> 00:17:09.920
that we have in our collection.

00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:13.310
But the most interesting thing

00:17:13.310 --> 00:17:19.020
about the collection is
not the famous works.

00:17:19.020 --> 00:17:22.570
One of the interesting things
and it was a bit puzzling

00:17:22.570 --> 00:17:27.240
when we started going through the
boxes is that we realized that most

00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:30.720
of the collection or not most,
but there are quite a few titles

00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:32.470
that are almost ephemera.

00:17:32.470 --> 00:17:39.640
And this one for example is a
very small book that was done

00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:46.940
for the commanders of small
military units in the Hamidian Army

00:17:46.940 --> 00:17:48.770
or the Hamidian Military.

00:17:48.770 --> 00:17:56.620
There are also all kind of annual
statistics of the court system,

00:17:56.620 --> 00:18:02.200
cookbooks, there are textbooks
intended for different students

00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:09.760
in different stages of the
Ottoman or the Hamidian curriculum.

00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:19.140
And I think that there are the
most interesting and rare books

00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:20.480
that we got for this collection.

00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:28.620
And these things have not been --
obviously, they were not purchased

00:18:28.620 --> 00:18:33.670 position:56%
in the 19th century and if they were
they were never taken seriously.

00:18:33.670 --> 00:18:36.640
So it's a way of getting very --

00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:45.570
it offers a glimpse into
the less prestigious sides

00:18:45.570 --> 00:18:49.600
of the Hamidian book
culture of the first,

00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:53.980
at least for the first
decade of Abdulhamid's rule.

00:18:55.340 --> 00:19:01.910
So and this is the most interesting
thing for this talk I think.

00:19:01.910 --> 00:19:08.910
One of the interesting things is
to figure out who has those sets.

00:19:08.910 --> 00:19:13.600
So we know that the Library of
Congress has a set and we know

00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:17.880 position:56%
that NYU has a set, apparently the
British Museum has a set and we know

00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:20.070
that the British Library has a set.

00:19:20.070 --> 00:19:24.120
Apparently, Leiden or some
Dutch university have a set,

00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:28.580
I mean I say it based on
the records I found on OCLC.

00:19:28.580 --> 00:19:33.630
They seem to have most
of the records.

00:19:33.630 --> 00:19:39.050
So they may have gotten
these through a similar gift.

00:19:39.050 --> 00:19:44.880
So if someone in the Netherlands
is watching this show or this talk,

00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:54.050
please contact me I'd be very glad
to know if they have a similar set.

00:19:54.050 --> 00:19:56.760
But my assumption or
the assumption I had

00:19:56.760 --> 00:19:59.560
when we catalogued these books is

00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:02.470
that there are many
more sets out there.

00:20:02.470 --> 00:20:07.070
I might be wrong, but when we
catalogued the set our assumption

00:20:07.070 --> 00:20:11.270
was or what we wanted to do,
we wanted to create records

00:20:11.270 --> 00:20:13.040
that other libraries could use

00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:17.650
to identify similar
sets in their holdings.

00:20:19.900 --> 00:20:27.650
I should also point out that
we got this set in a moment

00:20:27.650 --> 00:20:30.780
in the scholarship where
there is a renewed interest

00:20:30.780 --> 00:20:35.490
in Ottoman book culture in
general and specifically,

00:20:35.490 --> 00:20:40.100
in the book culture of
the Hamidian period.

00:20:40.100 --> 00:20:48.890
These are three studies that I know
of and that were published recently

00:20:48.890 --> 00:20:55.780 position:56%
about Hamidian, about the history
of the book and the Hamidian period.

00:20:55.780 --> 00:21:00.120
I should just point out that
[inaudible] article studies the

00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:05.710 position:56%
connections between a specific
publisher that he's well-represented

00:21:05.710 --> 00:21:12.030
in the set and Abdulhamid
during the Hamidian period.

00:21:12.030 --> 00:21:15.450
And one of the things that
we want to do or at least

00:21:15.450 --> 00:21:22.980
that we hope the set will allow
is to do more studies like this.

00:21:22.980 --> 00:21:27.010
Look at the publisher, so
that scholars could look

00:21:27.010 --> 00:21:34.670
at the different publishers and
see what we can learn from the sets

00:21:34.670 --> 00:21:37.230 position:56%
that are in the collection or from
the books that are in the collection

00:21:37.230 --> 00:21:41.380
about the connections
between these publishers

00:21:41.380 --> 00:21:45.450
and Abdulhamid and his court.

00:21:45.450 --> 00:21:53.680
And one of these things
is what we try to do is

00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:58.390
that through the metadata
to create --

00:21:58.390 --> 00:22:02.810
we use those studies to see
what scholars are looking

00:22:02.810 --> 00:22:09.290
for when they are studying Hamidian
book culture and we are trying

00:22:09.290 --> 00:22:13.710
to respond to these questions and
to these needs in our metadata.

00:22:13.710 --> 00:22:17.890
And I'll say a few words
about it in a few minutes.

00:22:19.340 --> 00:22:23.600
So this is how the
records look like.

00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:27.190
I'll just say that one of the
questions that we've been trying

00:22:27.190 --> 00:22:28.880
to figure out is how

00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:35.100
to transliterate the Ottoman
titles this is I think a question

00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:40.710
that everyone who is
cataloguing Ottoman materials is

00:22:40.710 --> 00:22:42.800
struggling with.

00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:47.830
I'll say that for the most
part if records existed

00:22:47.830 --> 00:22:50.780
in OCLC we didn't change
[inaudible] system

00:22:50.780 --> 00:22:54.390
because we didn't want
OCLC to reject our records.

00:22:54.390 --> 00:22:59.810
But we did add Arabic
script to all the fields.

00:22:59.810 --> 00:23:03.050
So this is one of the records
of the book that actually came

00:23:03.050 --> 00:23:09.550
from the Library of Congress and
we also kept the call numbers

00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:14.650
or at least this was [inaudible]
collection call number.

00:23:14.650 --> 00:23:17.460
We have 15 of these so far I think.

00:23:17.460 --> 00:23:22.230
And this is how the
record looks like.

00:23:22.230 --> 00:23:28.380
We included a description
of the physical books

00:23:28.380 --> 00:23:35.510
and the most important we obviously
added all the basic fields.

00:23:35.510 --> 00:23:40.930
We added 2796 that we are in
the process of transforming

00:23:40.930 --> 00:23:48.060
into 700 fields for both Abram
Hewitt and Abdulhamid the Second

00:23:48.060 --> 00:23:51.890
so that users can actually
go through the collection

00:23:51.890 --> 00:23:57.580
and have a sense of the
set in its entirety.

00:23:57.580 --> 00:24:04.650
And when we created or generated
original records we followed the

00:24:04.650 --> 00:24:08.030
Library of Congress
Ottoman [inaudible] system.

00:24:08.030 --> 00:24:18.880
I know it's not a common practice,
but we thought it would be nice.

00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:23.530
We also added Arabic script and
something that is not very common

00:24:23.530 --> 00:24:30.360
in cataloguing of Ottoman
materials for two reasons.

00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:40.130
The first reason is that Arabic
script enables users to search

00:24:40.130 --> 00:24:43.410
across the three main
Ottoman languages.

00:24:43.410 --> 00:24:47.500
It's very frustrating to figure
out the transliteration is

00:24:47.500 --> 00:24:50.460
in Turkish, in modern Turkish.

00:24:50.460 --> 00:24:54.430
And this is particularly important
because many of these books

00:24:54.430 --> 00:24:57.560
that were translated into Ottoman

00:24:57.560 --> 00:25:01.070
in that time period
were also translated

00:25:01.070 --> 00:25:05.090
into Arabic in Egypt or Beirut.

00:25:05.090 --> 00:25:07.420
So it will be nice to have --

00:25:07.420 --> 00:25:11.740
so we wanted users to
have the searchability

00:25:11.740 --> 00:25:16.330 position:56%
across the Ottoman language divides.

00:25:16.330 --> 00:25:23.530
But the other reason
is that we assume

00:25:23.530 --> 00:25:26.700
or at least there is
this possibility

00:25:26.700 --> 00:25:30.770
that a similar set was
given to other libraries

00:25:30.770 --> 00:25:35.960
in what is today Middle
Eastern countries.

00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:41.980
It is possible that similar sets
exist in Egypt and maybe in Iran

00:25:41.980 --> 00:25:48.380
and we thought that it would
be useful for whoever will look

00:25:48.380 --> 00:25:52.070
at these records in these
countries to have the Arabic

00:25:52.070 --> 00:25:57.160
that might make the
integration of these records

00:25:57.160 --> 00:26:00.700
into the catalogue easier.

00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:07.520
And I'll also show you how it
looks like if you want to look

00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:10.480
at the collection in its entirety.

00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:17.060
That's based on the 796 field
for Abdulhamid the Second.

00:26:17.060 --> 00:26:21.030
So here you have all the books
that we have catalogued so far

00:26:21.030 --> 00:26:25.520
and eventually we hope that
people could actually browse

00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:28.670
through the collection and
find interesting titles based

00:26:28.670 --> 00:26:31.580
on Abdulhamid.

00:26:31.580 --> 00:26:33.420
I want to conclude
by saying a few words

00:26:33.420 --> 00:26:39.460
about what we hope
will be the next step.

00:26:39.460 --> 00:26:46.350
So first, we hope to complete
the processing of this collection

00:26:46.350 --> 00:26:51.300
by the end of the summer and
make it available to researchers

00:26:51.300 --> 00:26:55.080
with a brief description
and analysis of what's there

00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:57.550
so users will know about it.

00:26:57.550 --> 00:27:05.160
And we may digitize, especially
the ephemera selectively

00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:11.080
because these are things that
we hope or assume will be --

00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:16.900
maybe heavily used is a
strong, is too hopeful,

00:27:16.900 --> 00:27:22.810
but they will be used more
than the famous works.

00:27:22.810 --> 00:27:25.330
And because they are brittle,
so it would make sense

00:27:25.330 --> 00:27:27.510
to actually have them digitized.

00:27:27.510 --> 00:27:31.990
And finally, we hope
to publish the records

00:27:31.990 --> 00:27:34.030
so other libraries could use it.

00:27:34.030 --> 00:27:40.040
And we might use it as a way
to experiment with link data

00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:45.220
and to think about
different RDF environments.

00:27:45.220 --> 00:27:49.770
So far as far as I know very
little has been worked --

00:27:49.770 --> 00:27:57.730
very little has been done with
RDF in special collections

00:27:57.730 --> 00:28:00.650
to trace provenance and to
link collections in terms

00:28:00.650 --> 00:28:02.720
of where the books came from.

00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:07.960 position:56%
And that might be an interesting way
and I really hope that the Library

00:28:07.960 --> 00:28:12.400
of Congress will be interested
in using these records

00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:16.890
and experimenting with them
as part of their big frame,

00:28:16.890 --> 00:28:20.770
the development of big frame.

00:28:20.770 --> 00:28:25.450
And we also hope that other
institutions will use these records

00:28:25.450 --> 00:28:30.290
to have a better understanding of
the history of their collections

00:28:30.290 --> 00:28:32.680
and about this practice
of giving books

00:28:32.680 --> 00:28:35.080
in the Hamidian and
the Ottoman period.

00:28:35.080 --> 00:28:38.870
And I think I'll stop here.

you very much Guy.

I'd like to invite questions
and please know again

00:28:49.630 --> 00:28:52.360
that you're being recorded
if you're asking questions.

00:28:52.360 --> 00:28:55.890
But a fascinating presentation
I'm sure some

00:28:55.890 --> 00:28:57.960
of our [inaudible] must
have some questions

00:28:57.960 --> 00:29:03.390
and Guy will answer
those questions for us.

Anybody, questions?

00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:21.340
&gt;&gt; Guy Burak: So that's something

00:29:21.340 --> 00:29:22.980
that we don't really know
who made the selection.

00:29:22.980 --> 00:29:29.630
The description says that all
the books that were published

00:29:29.630 --> 00:29:33.620
in I don't know if in the empire

00:29:33.620 --> 00:29:41.210
since 1876 were included
in this gift.

00:29:41.210 --> 00:29:44.880 position:56%
Obviously, this is not the case
because there are no books in Greek,

00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:48.130
Armenian, Hebrew and so
these are mostly books

00:29:48.130 --> 00:29:50.170
in Arabic, Turkish and Persian.

00:29:50.170 --> 00:29:54.760
And probably and they don't include
books that were published as far

00:29:54.760 --> 00:29:57.770
as we can tell, they don't
include books published

00:29:57.770 --> 00:30:01.340
in the Arab provinces
and even in the provinces

00:30:01.340 --> 00:30:04.530
in Anatolia and in the Balkans.

00:30:04.530 --> 00:30:09.850
There are a few books that
were published in provinces

00:30:09.850 --> 00:30:15.130
that are pretty close to Istanbul,

00:30:15.130 --> 00:30:18.850
but we don't really know
who decided to include.

00:30:18.850 --> 00:30:23.210
I mean there might be
other documents out there.

00:30:23.210 --> 00:30:26.190
But if someone comes
across something

00:30:26.190 --> 00:30:29.070
that would be really,
really interesting.

00:30:29.070 --> 00:30:31.130
But we also know that
there are some differences

00:30:31.130 --> 00:30:34.390
between the collection
not major differences.

00:30:34.390 --> 00:30:42.150 position:56%
Apparently we have some titles that
the Library of Congress do not have.

00:30:42.150 --> 00:30:46.730
But once we have the inventories so
we can actually compare holdings.

00:30:46.730 --> 00:31:03.660

your presentation it was

00:31:08.380 --> 00:31:09.850
fascinating [inaudible].

00:31:09.850 --> 00:31:14.680
&gt;&gt; Guy Burak: I didn't know about
the photograph, I mean I knew --

00:31:14.680 --> 00:31:18.870
by the photograph you
mean the famous album?

00:31:18.870 --> 00:31:20.170
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:31:20.170 --> 00:31:22.110
&gt;&gt; Guy Burak: We didn't
get the famous album.

00:31:22.110 --> 00:31:30.150 position:56%
I think the famous album exists only
two copies in the world or I think,

00:31:30.150 --> 00:31:34.480
so we just got the books.

00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:40.870
I don't know the albums well enough
to say how we can actually link

00:31:40.870 --> 00:31:44.280
or what kind of links
could be established

00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:45.860
between these collections.

00:31:45.860 --> 00:31:51.240
And I think they are part of
the same interest of Abdulhamid

00:31:51.240 --> 00:31:56.400
in projecting a certain
image of the empire.

00:31:56.400 --> 00:31:59.240
Although, I've recently
heard there are some doubts

00:31:59.240 --> 00:32:07.010
about who was behind the album
and how officially it was done.

00:32:07.010 --> 00:32:12.310
But yeah, I mean in
terms of if there are --

00:32:12.310 --> 00:32:15.840
I mean I don't know them well
enough, but if someone can think

00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:21.510
of interesting connections I'd be
more than happy to talk about it.

you on the spot but.

00:32:53.550 --> 00:32:55.760 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Okay [inaudible] photographs
division we do have the photographic

00:32:55.760 --> 00:32:58.690
albums that were given
to the library.

00:32:58.690 --> 00:33:01.560
We couldn't bring them today
because they're quite fragile

00:33:01.560 --> 00:33:03.710
and we don't serve
them to researchers.

00:33:03.710 --> 00:33:08.950
We have digital images of all
the photographs in the album.

00:33:08.950 --> 00:33:10.860
They were done a while ago,

00:33:10.860 --> 00:33:14.550
so they don't really reflect the
quality of the actual images.

00:33:14.550 --> 00:33:20.510 position:56%
But this is a handout that we have
that shows what the covers look like

00:33:20.510 --> 00:33:22.030
and some information about it.

00:33:22.030 --> 00:33:24.980
So there is an individual
catalogue record and image

00:33:24.980 --> 00:33:27.540
for every photograph
that is in the --

00:33:27.540 --> 00:33:29.350
and I'm not remember how
many albums there are.

00:33:29.350 --> 00:33:32.660
So you can see it online
and we have information

00:33:32.660 --> 00:33:36.070
about the website where
you can find them.

00:33:36.070 --> 00:33:38.860
And if you come to the
reading room we do have a few

00:33:38.860 --> 00:33:40.210
that are safely housed

00:33:40.210 --> 00:33:44.810
and in certain circumstances we
will show them to researchers.

00:33:44.810 --> 00:33:51.450
Are there any questions
about the albums?

00:33:51.450 --> 00:33:53.250
I'd be glad to.

&gt;&gt; Guy Burak: I mean if they're good
it would be -- I mean in general,

00:34:21.410 --> 00:34:28.590
I mean what is or at least what
I thought would be interesting is

00:34:29.820 --> 00:34:38.890
to have a sense of what's out there
knowing that we have only part

00:34:38.890 --> 00:34:44.730
of the Hamidian production, but
that people could actually add

00:34:44.730 --> 00:34:47.320
to this collection and
eventually we'll have a sense

00:34:47.320 --> 00:34:52.320
of what was published in the
empire and in this time period.

00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:57.960
And what was given as gifts to
different libraries in Europe,

00:34:57.960 --> 00:35:01.180
North America, and possibly
the Middle East and beyond.

00:35:01.180 --> 00:35:07.870 position:56%

important part of it and I'd be more

than happy to collaborate with
whoever has records and collections.

00:35:13.660 --> 00:35:19.590
And again, this is one of
the reasons why we think --

00:35:19.590 --> 00:35:23.510
we are thinking seriously
about publishing the records.

[ Inaudible Comment ]

00:36:06.040 --> 00:36:08.970
Yeah, I'll start with the
second because it's easier

00:36:08.970 --> 00:36:14.420
or at least I haven't gone through
the entire Persian collection.

00:36:14.420 --> 00:36:19.900
Most of the things
are in the [inaudible]

00:36:19.900 --> 00:36:24.390
with some have commentaries,
some don't.

00:36:24.390 --> 00:36:29.850
But as far as I can tell at
this point are mostly classics.

00:36:29.850 --> 00:36:32.900
I might be wrong there might be
things that I haven't seen yet.

00:36:32.900 --> 00:36:39.470 position:56%
The assumption is that most of these
books exist somewhere in Turkey

00:36:39.470 --> 00:36:45.960
and the main problem is it's
mostly a discoverability issue.

00:36:45.960 --> 00:36:50.920
It's very difficult to find
records for these books,

00:36:50.920 --> 00:36:58.250
at least on the platforms that
we are using or not in OCLC

00:36:58.250 --> 00:37:02.130
and if they are not they
are not English records.

00:37:02.130 --> 00:37:10.660 position:56%
So this is -- but we do hope, I mean
I know that some Turkish scholars

00:37:10.660 --> 00:37:14.030
and Turkish librarians have
been or have shown interest

00:37:14.030 --> 00:37:19.030
in this collection and I think
that once it's done people will --

00:37:19.030 --> 00:37:24.390 position:56%
I hope it will draw more attention
and people will in Turkey and again,

00:37:24.390 --> 00:37:28.280
else will actually go
back to their libraries

00:37:28.280 --> 00:37:31.290
and look at their holdings.

00:37:31.290 --> 00:37:38.070
But so far many of these books
I've not been able to find

00:37:38.070 --> 00:37:47.100
in Turkish libraries, but to
be fair I haven't been looking

00:37:47.100 --> 00:37:49.530
at the catalogues of
individual libraries.

00:37:49.530 --> 00:37:54.270

&gt;&gt; Guy Burak: I mean the collection

00:38:21.360 --> 00:38:24.290
when I started cataloguing
it seems incredibly random.

00:38:24.290 --> 00:38:30.510
You have everything from
cookbooks to engineering manuals

00:38:30.510 --> 00:38:33.720
to school textbooks
to military manuals

00:38:33.720 --> 00:38:36.980
to high classics to Islamic law.

00:38:36.980 --> 00:38:41.570
It's a very, very wide -- it's
a very wide range of topics.

00:38:41.570 --> 00:38:44.380
And I think that this is one of the
things that makes this collection

00:38:44.380 --> 00:38:48.950
so interesting is precisely
because it was not --

00:38:48.950 --> 00:38:55.580
it didn't focus on the
high note or the classics,

00:38:55.580 --> 00:39:01.350
but it actually gave
everything or not everything,

00:39:01.350 --> 00:39:07.740
but that he gave Hewitt most of
what was published in Turkey,

00:39:07.740 --> 00:39:09.140
as long as it was printed.

00:39:09.140 --> 00:39:11.790
And this is why I think
the collection is

00:39:11.790 --> 00:39:14.900
so riveting and interesting.

00:39:14.900 --> 00:39:16.940
&gt;&gt; Joan Weeks: I'd like to show
you [inaudible] collection.

00:39:16.940 --> 00:39:25.830
This is one of the books and
I want everybody to come up

00:39:25.830 --> 00:39:28.860
and have a close-up look at this.

00:39:28.860 --> 00:39:35.510
It's got a gold leaf on the
pages and the dedication

00:39:35.510 --> 00:39:42.040 position:56%
on the front cover it's made by his
Majesty Sultan Abdulhamid the Second

00:39:42.040 --> 00:39:46.100
to the National Library of
the United States of America

00:39:46.100 --> 00:39:48.710
through the honorable A. S. Hewitt.

00:39:48.710 --> 00:39:53.810
And it goes on through this and on
the back side I've turned second

00:39:53.810 --> 00:39:56.480
from [inaudible] back side so that.

00:39:56.480 --> 00:40:00.760
These are very, very
fragile, very brittle paper.

00:40:00.760 --> 00:40:06.310
And I think that's why the library
microfilmed the entire collection

00:40:06.310 --> 00:40:08.200
of books.

00:40:08.200 --> 00:40:11.790
And the back side is all
in the Ottoman Turkish.

00:40:11.790 --> 00:40:17.380
And I wanted to kind of ask I
noticed on your slide that one

00:40:17.380 --> 00:40:20.700
of the entries was
for Susine [phonetic]

00:40:20.700 --> 00:40:26.750
and Susine was this eclectic, I
call him almost a renaissance man

00:40:26.750 --> 00:40:29.240
in this [inaudible]
Ottoman materials.

00:40:29.240 --> 00:40:31.290
And I noticed you had an
entry there for Susine

00:40:31.290 --> 00:40:37.160
and I don't know whether the
book happened to be the same book

00:40:37.160 --> 00:40:40.900
that Susine collected,
probably that's what happened

00:40:40.900 --> 00:40:43.760
because we've got the
catalogue in here [inaudible].

00:40:43.760 --> 00:40:46.340
Alan Mayberry [inaudible]
the primary catalogue

00:40:46.340 --> 00:40:49.790 position:56%
of our collections, but I don't know
if there's some kind of parallel

00:40:49.790 --> 00:40:54.800
that we have a Susine book
that replicates one of these.

00:40:54.800 --> 00:40:59.030
I'd invite you to come up and
look at these upfront and personal

00:40:59.030 --> 00:41:00.400
and also in the back

00:41:00.400 --> 00:41:05.720
on our microfilm reader machine
I loaded a reel of the microfilm.

00:41:05.720 --> 00:41:09.680
So in the 80's they
microfilmed our Library

00:41:09.680 --> 00:41:11.670
of Congress entire collection.

00:41:11.670 --> 00:41:14.630
This is what so intrigued
me when I met Guy Barak

00:41:14.630 --> 00:41:16.400
at the Middle East
Librarians Associated

00:41:16.400 --> 00:41:18.470
and started talking about this.

00:41:18.470 --> 00:41:21.910
And I said well we've got the
microfilm for this collection

00:41:21.910 --> 00:41:24.450
and I know one of the
most exciting things

00:41:24.450 --> 00:41:27.980
that they're doing now
is digitizing microfilm.

00:41:27.980 --> 00:41:32.390
And I can see such potential if you
could figure out which books are

00:41:32.390 --> 00:41:38.090
which and digitize our
microfilm, digitize these records.

00:41:38.090 --> 00:41:43.690
I think bit frame is a wave
of the future for cataloguing

00:41:43.690 --> 00:41:47.150
because it links data, which
means that you can link

00:41:47.150 --> 00:41:49.350
through to these photographic
albums,

00:41:49.350 --> 00:41:52.560
you can link through to
other library's holdings,

00:41:52.560 --> 00:41:59.720
knowledge of these collections
in hopes of tremendous potential.

00:41:59.720 --> 00:42:02.910
So I invite you to come
around and look at the books

00:42:02.910 --> 00:42:07.610
and we have pictures of what the
photographic albums look like.

00:42:07.610 --> 00:42:10.030
Also if you want to
look at the microfilm

00:42:10.030 --> 00:42:12.760
in the back machine
what that looks like.

00:42:12.760 --> 00:42:14.680
We invite you to come in

00:42:14.680 --> 00:42:18.150
and do research using the
microfilm, that's easy to surf.

00:42:18.150 --> 00:42:22.940
And I hope you will come
back and really investigate

00:42:22.940 --> 00:42:25.510
and help us process this
collection, so thank you.

00:42:25.510 --> 00:42:27.640

just say that if you want

00:42:27.640 --> 00:42:31.430
to use the physical books
