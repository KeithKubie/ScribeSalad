can say that the stories are fairly
 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.740
can say that the stories are fairly
different and I wouldn't say any ripping

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750
different and I wouldn't say any ripping

off or copying has occurred it's just
that they have similar themes and they

00:03:15.759 --> 00:03:15.769

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:20.450
Dead celebration and so inevitably they
 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:22.390
Dead celebration and so inevitably they
