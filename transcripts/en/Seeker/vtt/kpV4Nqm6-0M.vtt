00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.800
Some of you have heard the term Blood Brain
Barrier, and of course, some have not.

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:07.309
But lets just say….you basically have a
brick wall around your brain.

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:10.200
Gives another meaning to being hard headed.

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.200
HEYO.

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:12.200
I’m sorry.

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:13.750
Hey guys, Julia here for DNews

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:15.589
Your body is constantly in flux.

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:19.900
From eating, drinking, exercise, whatever,
amino acids and hormones and other chemicals

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:21.500
in your body change in response.

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.650
For example, your blood sugar spikes after
you eat a piece of cake.

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.609
But there’s one area that you’d want to
remain relatively unchanged, your brain.

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.600
So there’s like a fortresses between the
brain and the blood called the blood brain

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.379
barrier, or BBB.

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:36.720
So what is this thing?

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:41.960
Shout to Asmon Lacroix on twitter for asking
us this very question! #askdnews

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.030
The BBB surrounds blood vessels in the brain
and central nervous system.

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.440
It locks down the brain and spinal cord fluid.

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.950
It lets the necessary molecules through and
keeps the bad stuff out.

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:55.410
It’s made up of tightly knitted endothelial
cells, enzymes and transporters.

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.440
Some people have described it as "a brick
wall” around a vast majority of your brain.

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.329
Where each cell of the blood-brain barrier
is a brick and the tight junctions between

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:04.510
them are the mortar."

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:09.320
The BBB allows small molecules like alcohol
to squeeze through and the enzymes and transporters

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.110
allow essential nutrients like vitamin c and
omega 3s to cross.

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.250
But large molecules and bacteria are kept
out.

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:18.870
This whole system keeps what’s on the inside
stable.

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:22.580
The brain needs specific microenvironments
to function properly.

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:26.220
The brain’s communication system relies
on chemical and electrical signalling between

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.159
neurons in a tightly controlled environment
to function.

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.170
But conditions like inflammation and HIV can
weaken the barrier.

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:36.650
If a bacteria or virus in the blood stream
were to bypass the BBB and get in the brain,

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:39.920
it would get into the way of that kind of
signalling and things would get thrown way

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.390
out of balance.

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:43.670
Brain infections are incredibly rare thanks
to the BBB.

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.740
But that also means when someone does get
one, it’s incredibly dangerous and hard

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:48.780
to treat.

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.690
While good at keeping out the bad stuff, the
BBB is unfortunately good at keeping out the

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:53.690
good stuff too.

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:55.640
Like potentially life saving medicine.

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:00.350
According to the Royal Chemistry Society,
over 95 per cent of drugs do not show useful

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:01.780
activity in the brain.

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.570
Those that do make their way into the brain
are only for conditions like depression, schizophrenia,

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:06.770
and insomnia.

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:11.160
There are ways to bypass the BBB but it’s
complicated and is basically neurosurgery.

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.700
Like an intracerebral implantation, which
just like it sounds is an implant put directly

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.000
into the cerebrum.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.920
But brain tissue is dense, so it’s hard
for medicines to diffuse through the tissue.

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.390
So not ideal.

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:25.670
But there might be a way to tunnel through
the brick wall with sound waves.

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.140
Which could help brain tumor patients.

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.380
Brain tumors are notoriously hard to treat
or take out with surgery, especially a nasty

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:33.860
one like glioma.

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:35.500
They often leave roots behind.

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.750
And chemotherapy can’t cross the BBB, leaving
few options for treatment.

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.610
So researchers at Sunnybrook Health Sciences
Centre in Canada did something no one else

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:44.770
has done before.

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:47.800
They opened up the BBB with sound waves to
let chemo in.

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:52.430
Seriously, earlier research published in the
journal Ultrasound in Medicine &amp; Biology found

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:57.440
that tiny air bubbles injected into the blood
stream could open up the BBB enough to let

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:58.720
the good stuff in.

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:03.070
They used low-intensity ultrasound waves to
guide the bubbles to blood vessels near the

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:04.070
BBB.

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:07.970
These sound waves made the bubbles expand
and contract and kind of vibrate.

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:11.920
This vibration jiggled open some of the junctions
between cells in the BBB.

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:16.970
In the case of Sunnybrook research, once openings
in the BBB were made, life-saving chemotherapy

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:19.960
could slip through and finally reach it’s
target.

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:23.630
So our bodies are complicated and weird and
mostly fighting FOR us.

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:26.660
But sometimes we have to work against it,
to save lives.

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:31.490
Speaking of weird body things and blood things,
ever wonder why we have different blood types?

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:41.040
There are a number of different blood types
that a person can have, but what’s the difference

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:42.040
between them all?

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.300
Julian has the answer in this episode, right
here

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:48.410
So do you have any other questions about how
the body works?
