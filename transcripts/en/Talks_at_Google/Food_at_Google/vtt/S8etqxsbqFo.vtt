00:00:01.554 --> 00:00:03.970
FEMALE SPEAKER: Thanks for
coming out and joining us today

00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:05.910
to hear Josey talk
about his new book,

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.025
and his voyage to make bread.

00:00:08.025 --> 00:00:08.900
JOSEY BAKER: [LAUGHS]

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:11.290
So I've known Josey
for about three years.

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:14.180
He started his bread journey
right around the time

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:16.309
that I guess I met him, right?

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:18.180
So he'll give you a
bit more of the story.

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.877
But I think in good
Google fashion,

00:00:20.877 --> 00:00:22.710
we have an awesome video
to really highlight

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.770
the history of how Josey started
to start this bread journey,

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:27.270
so I'm just going
to play that video

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:29.770
and then afterwards, Josey will
give us a bit of a talk, so.

00:00:31.427 --> 00:00:33.010
JOSEY BAKER (VOICEOVER):
I've wrestled

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:35.080
a lot with the
question now than I'm

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:38.700
so invested in this project.

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.420
Do I want to be doing this?

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:42.789
How long will I want
to be doing this?

00:00:42.789 --> 00:00:44.705
Because I haven't been
doing it for that long,

00:00:44.705 --> 00:00:47.390
and I've been doing it in a
really different way than I'm

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:48.380
about to be doing it.

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:56.960
JOSEY BAKER: It's
like in college.

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:58.180
You meet someone new.

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:01.110
You're just like, can't stop
thinking about them, you know?

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:02.544
And you're staying up late.

00:01:02.544 --> 00:01:03.585
And like, you don't care.

00:01:03.585 --> 00:01:05.700
You're going to be late
for class tomorrow.

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.470
You don't give a
shit, because you're

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.160
going to go hang
out with them later.

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.982
It's going to be good.

00:01:11.982 --> 00:01:15.755
That's the way I feel about my
girlfriend-- and about bread.

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.940
My name is Josey Baker.

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:21.855
I'm a bread baker.

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.295
The first time that I
baked a loaf of bread

00:01:27.295 --> 00:01:29.950
was not that long ago, it
was 2 and 1/2 years ago.

00:01:32.654 --> 00:01:34.070
JOSEY BAKER
(VOICEOVER): It was so

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:36.031
exciting to take the
finished loaf of bread

00:01:36.031 --> 00:01:37.614
and bring it, and
give it to somebody.

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:43.616
When I approached the owners
of Mission Pie I said,

00:01:43.616 --> 00:01:44.990
maybe I could rent
space from you

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:47.870
when you're not using your oven.

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:49.850
It was written into
the contract that we

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:52.677
had that I need to have to
at least 10 loves of bread

00:01:52.677 --> 00:01:54.010
available for walk-in customers.

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:58.500
Some days, it felt
like 80 loves,

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:59.958
you know, in just
like a few hours.

00:02:02.335 --> 00:02:08.940
For most people, the best
loaf of bread that they've had

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.830
is either a loaf that
they made themselves,

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.700
or a loaf that they
got from a neighbor.

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.220
Somebody that made it
like a matter of hours

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:21.510
before, and really like, put
part of themself into it,

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:22.156
you know?

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:30.190
CHARLIE HALLOWELL: Josey has the
few of these simple things that

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:33.090
just help, like
his heart is open.

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.510
You can just tell he has
a commitment to serving

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.440
the people around
him, and his friends,

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:39.780
and the people he loves.

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.180
He has an advantage in that
way where he can be a novice,

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.675
and still have this
remarkable product.

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:50.550
JOSEY BAKER
(VOICEOVER): Most people

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:54.870
have what it takes to
make something yummy.

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.690
It's all the other
stuff that separates out

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:00.050
the people who make
a few jars of jam,

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:03.400
sell it to their neighbors-- to
the people who end up actually

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.102
making a successful
business out of it.

00:03:06.102 --> 00:03:08.180
Because it's a lot
more than that.

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:09.910
Jesus, I had no idea.

00:03:15.795 --> 00:03:17.170
JEREMY TOOKER:
One of the reasons

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:19.630
that Josey's bread is so
good is because he will never

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:20.769
say how good it is.

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:23.310
Because that's the way he sees
it-- I could always be better.

00:03:25.904 --> 00:03:27.320
JODI GEREN: We
always knew that we

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:30.010
wanted to open another location.

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:32.020
I think that you
probably had your hands

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:34.239
in like, five different
potential leases--

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:35.030
JEREMY TOOKER: Yes.

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:36.280
JODI GEREN: --around the city.

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.260
JEREMY TOOKER: And I
basically lied to everyone

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.904
to get them to jump
on board the project.

00:03:40.904 --> 00:03:41.820
JODI GEREN: Yeah, so--

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:43.611
JEREMY TOOKER: I can
do it for 150, 50,000.

00:03:43.611 --> 00:03:44.210
No problem.

00:03:46.814 --> 00:03:49.039
When we found the space,
it was a bit bigger

00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:50.830
than we were looking
for for a second cafe.

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:52.230
And then, we started to
think about what else

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:52.930
we could do in the space.

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:55.360
I think it was falling asleep
one night, I was like--ah!

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.060
Baker.

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.540
Just put Josey Baker in there.

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:03.670
JOSEY BAKER: That wasn't on my
radar, getting my own space.

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:06.980
But as soon as he asked me I was
like oh, if I'm going to do it,

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:09.920
like this is a
golden opportunity.

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:12.120
So let's go for it.

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:17.899
I think right here
actually, about right

00:04:17.899 --> 00:04:21.580
here is going to
be our toast bar.

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:24.750
We're installing this oven,
this huge oven from Italy,

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:25.420
it's crazy.

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:29.870
This will be the
mill room right here.

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:32.514
This is the mill.

00:04:32.514 --> 00:04:34.555
I can't even believe it,
you want to look inside?

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:40.720
This little string
and rod controls

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:43.640
how quickly the grains fall in.

00:04:45.532 --> 00:04:47.240
JODI GEREN: He's one
of those people that

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:50.000
could learned how
to do anything.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.630
So for us, we're just really
lucky that it's bread,

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:59.610
and we're really lucky that he
was naive enough at one point

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:03.539
to take us up on
this crazy offer.

00:05:03.539 --> 00:05:05.080
JOSEY BAKER: I hadn't
gotten very far

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:07.029
in my conceiving of
this whole thing.

00:05:07.029 --> 00:05:09.070
I didn't know where I was
going to get the money.

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:09.810
I was like, OK.

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:14.140
I need like, $30,000 dollars,
$35,000 dollars or something.

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:16.170
I'll like, I'll ask
around, and I'll find that.

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:19.960
And I did ask around,
and I found it.

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:23.005
It very quickly, I realized that
that was nowhere near enough.

00:05:23.005 --> 00:05:27.510
Oh geez, I need like,
I need that much again.

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:31.030
I need that much again six
to eight months after that.

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:35.264
And that number is
you know, times 5.

00:05:35.264 --> 00:05:37.680
CHARLIE HALLOWELL: I like,
invested in his business a lot,

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:40.790
like every dime of my
savings, basically.

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:45.955
And I love Josey, but it was
definitely like blind faith.

00:05:47.677 --> 00:05:49.760
JOSEY BAKER (VOICEOVER):
This is a big commitment.

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:51.014
JOSEY BAKER: No problem.

00:05:51.014 --> 00:05:52.430
MALE SPEAKER: Was
this back there?

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:54.680
JOSEY BAKER: It was hiding
back there, hiding on you.

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:56.030
JOSEY BAKER (VOICEOVER):
Someone's got to make all of it

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:56.530
happen.

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:58.250
And if it's your
project, you're going

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:01.230
to be the one to
make it all happen.

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:02.790
None of those
people you hire are

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:05.174
going to care about
it as much as you do.

00:06:05.174 --> 00:06:06.840
JOSEY BAKER: It's
hardest to find things

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:09.140
when they're right
in front of you.

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:11.040
This is our kiosk,
this is our area

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:14.230
for people to come in
and sample the wares.

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:17.515
And this is copyrighted, so
you know, don't try to copy

00:06:17.515 --> 00:06:20.370
this, anybody.

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:22.139
We're making toast,
you how to make toast.

00:06:22.139 --> 00:06:23.139
MALE SPEAKER: Thank you.

00:06:23.139 --> 00:06:23.889
JOSEY BAKER: Yeah.

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:30.840
FEMALE SPEAKER: Mmm.

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:34.680
Now we know what
treats to buy for you.

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:36.130
JOSEY BAKER: Mmm.

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:40.200
We're going to be doing this
until the place is built out,

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:42.654
which will be, you know,
couple months from now.

00:06:42.654 --> 00:06:44.320
MALE SPEAKER: You're
building now, yeah?

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:44.710
JOSEY BAKER: Yeah.

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:45.680
Yeah, a couple months.

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:46.010
MALE SPEAKER: Really?

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:46.360
JOSEY BAKER: Yeah.

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:46.820
MALE SPEAKER: Really nice spot.

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:47.819
JOSEY BAKER: Open it up.

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:05.062
JOSEY BAKER (VOICEOVER):
It's taking a long time.

00:07:05.062 --> 00:07:07.020
It's taking a lot longer
than I think any of us

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:08.920
thought it was going to take.

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:12.620
Planning on opening in
June of 2012, and then that

00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:13.317
doesn't happen.

00:07:13.317 --> 00:07:15.150
OK we're going to plan
on opening in August.

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:17.733
That doesn't-- OK, we're going
to plan on opening in November.

00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:24.650
JOSEY BAKER: I was in
here the other night,

00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:26.090
and it was pouring rain.

00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:30.000
Water started just
pouring out of this.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.830
It started just
pouring out of that.

00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:36.410
This hole in the ceiling,
this hole on the ceiling.

00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:37.840
I go into my
walk-in, and there's

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:40.830
like an inch of
water on the ground.

00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:54.510
JOSEY BAKER (VOICEOVER): It's
always just been me, you know?

00:07:54.510 --> 00:07:57.300
How can I figure
out how to just make

00:07:57.300 --> 00:08:00.870
this work by delivering
the bread on my bike?

00:08:00.870 --> 00:08:04.680
By walking around and
asking people if I could

00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:06.005
you know, rent space from them?

00:08:09.701 --> 00:08:10.575
Now, I have a bakery.

00:08:14.091 --> 00:08:16.050
I've got a lot of
loans to pay off.

00:08:20.343 --> 00:08:24.965
I'm invested in this project
with these people you know,

00:08:24.965 --> 00:08:28.010
and that we're now really
relying on each other.

00:08:30.650 --> 00:08:35.360
That's scary,
because I've wondered

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:37.830
how long am I going
to want to do this?

00:08:37.830 --> 00:08:40.070
Because I haven't been
doing it for that long,

00:08:40.070 --> 00:08:42.776
and I've been doing it in a
really different way than I'm

00:08:42.776 --> 00:08:43.650
about to be doing it.

00:08:53.811 --> 00:08:56.060
JOSEY BAKER: We're out in
Chico at Dave Miller's house

00:08:56.060 --> 00:08:58.340
at his bakery for
one last trip out

00:08:58.340 --> 00:09:01.673
before I open up the bakery.

00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:09.360
Bread is what brought us
together, and a lot of what

00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:11.390
we talk about.

00:09:11.390 --> 00:09:13.640
He's been doing this
for a really long time,

00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:18.370
and I'm only like now
engaging in certain questions

00:09:18.370 --> 00:09:21.142
that he engaged in
a long time ago.

00:09:21.142 --> 00:09:24.940
You know, and so
that's why I mean,

00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:27.200
he's the closest thing
I have to a mentor.

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:29.750
He has answers to a lot
of the questions I have,

00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:31.690
and he's really
happy to share them.

00:09:39.510 --> 00:09:41.010
DAVE MILLER: That
is the one problem

00:09:41.010 --> 00:09:42.230
with doing everything yourself.

00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:44.355
You don't have anyone to
blame when it doesn't out.

00:09:44.355 --> 00:09:46.130
JOSEY BAKER: Totally.

00:09:46.130 --> 00:09:49.720
Now I have the opposite issue
with having Wendy's help.

00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:53.050
It's like we look at two loves
of bread and like, one of them

00:09:53.050 --> 00:09:55.620
is perfect, and one of them
is like a little lopsided,

00:09:55.620 --> 00:09:58.100
I'm like, fuck.

00:09:58.100 --> 00:10:00.590
Wendy-- Wendy made the
one that looks perfect.

00:10:04.290 --> 00:10:06.850
In San Fransisco I don't
feel like there's really

00:10:06.850 --> 00:10:12.776
any room for me to slow down.

00:10:12.776 --> 00:10:14.150
And I get out
here, and it's just

00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:21.743
like, everything's
going to be fine.

00:10:24.340 --> 00:10:27.230
It's going to be shot in
the dark for everybody, man.

00:10:27.230 --> 00:10:28.030
It's, it's fine.

00:10:28.030 --> 00:10:29.407
I'd rather--

00:10:29.407 --> 00:10:30.740
WENDY: It's better to have not--

00:10:30.740 --> 00:10:32.000
JOSEY BAKER: I'd rather
for the first few days

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.160
not have enough than
have like-- that's

00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:37.880
just, like psychologically,
that's damaging, you know?

00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:41.225
We're trying to guesstimate
daily numbers right now.

00:10:41.225 --> 00:10:43.725
We're going to do it the first
day, we're going to be wrong.

00:10:43.725 --> 00:10:44.000
WENDY: Yeah.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.600
JOSEY BAKER: We're going
to adjust the second day,

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:46.740
we're going to be wrong.

00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:48.740
WENDY: I mean if we
sell out, sell out.

00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:51.150
JOSEY BAKER: Yeah, we
not superheroes, right?

00:10:51.150 --> 00:10:52.090
We're bakers.

00:10:56.520 --> 00:11:02.060
I think that most
people probably,

00:11:02.060 --> 00:11:07.630
regardless of what they do, if
you're committed to anything,

00:11:07.630 --> 00:11:12.290
you're going to wonder
whether or not you want to be.

00:11:18.254 --> 00:11:19.250
Awesome.

00:11:19.250 --> 00:11:19.620
JOSEY BAKER
(VOICEOVER): Seems kind

00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:21.750
of boring to not be
committed to something.

00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:25.850
Really good things take time.

00:11:29.826 --> 00:11:31.317
JOSEY BAKER: Oh,
fucking shit man.

00:12:33.442 --> 00:12:34.930
This good?

00:12:34.930 --> 00:12:35.430
OK.

00:12:48.849 --> 00:12:53.322
Yeah, yeah. [LAUGHING] I
can see that, feel that.

00:13:21.246 --> 00:13:22.662
JOSEY BAKER
(VOICEOVER): We're not

00:13:22.662 --> 00:13:26.145
trying to like to become
a croissant master,

00:13:26.145 --> 00:13:29.170
or a cookie master,
or whatever, you know?

00:13:29.170 --> 00:13:32.200
I just want to make bread.

00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:40.760
I wish that I could give other
people the love and the focus

00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:43.545
that I've found through it.

00:14:30.050 --> 00:14:33.522
[APPLAUSE]

00:14:33.522 --> 00:14:37.450
JOSEY BAKER:
[CLEARS THROAT] Thank you.

00:14:37.450 --> 00:14:39.440
Thanks for coming very much.

00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:43.940
It's really exciting
to do events like this,

00:14:43.940 --> 00:14:47.040
and it is always
amazing to me when

00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:50.340
people that I don't
already know come.

00:14:50.340 --> 00:14:54.270
So thanks for coming.

00:14:54.270 --> 00:14:58.640
Yeah, and like I said at
the end, wow, there I am.

00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:00.600
Like I said at the
end of that movie

00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:03.004
there, that was quite a trip
down memory lane for me.

00:15:03.004 --> 00:15:04.670
I hadn't watched that
in a little while.

00:15:04.670 --> 00:15:08.640
And we opened The Mill
in February of last year,

00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:10.720
so it's been almost
a year and a half.

00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:17.150
And that feels
like very long ago.

00:15:17.150 --> 00:15:20.380
But I said at the
end of the movie

00:15:20.380 --> 00:15:22.990
there that I wish that
I could give people

00:15:22.990 --> 00:15:27.240
the love and the focus that
I've found through bread.

00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:35.230
And you know, little
did I know that that's

00:15:35.230 --> 00:15:39.590
what this book is really
allowing me to do.

00:15:39.590 --> 00:15:46.340
And it's been really amazing
to be hearing from people

00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:49.710
who have the book, and
are baking from it,

00:15:49.710 --> 00:15:54.120
and are having a lot
of success at home.

00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:58.730
And I get lots of emails that
are filled with exclamation

00:15:58.730 --> 00:16:02.645
points because people are
so pumped up because they--

00:16:02.645 --> 00:16:04.800
you know a common
thing I hear is

00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:12.420
that folks have tried to bake
a few loaves of bread at home.

00:16:12.420 --> 00:16:18.350
Or they just thought that
they weren't a baker,

00:16:18.350 --> 00:16:21.160
they didn't have what it took.

00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:24.919
And for whatever reason,
they decided to get the book

00:16:24.919 --> 00:16:25.710
and give it a shot.

00:16:25.710 --> 00:16:30.070
And lone behold,
they are a baker,

00:16:30.070 --> 00:16:33.780
just like you all are bakers.

00:16:33.780 --> 00:16:40.260
Because I mean four years
ago, literally four years ago,

00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:44.110
I hadn't baked bread at all.

00:16:44.110 --> 00:16:50.150
And my friend
George was traveling

00:16:50.150 --> 00:16:54.340
through San Fransisco, and
he had a little container

00:16:54.340 --> 00:16:55.770
with a little brown lump in it.

00:16:55.770 --> 00:17:00.250
And I said George, what is
that gross looking stuff?

00:17:00.250 --> 00:17:02.222
And he said, it's a
sourdough starter.

00:17:02.222 --> 00:17:04.430
I was like well, why do you
have a sourdough starter?

00:17:04.430 --> 00:17:07.760
You can't bake good
bread at home, right?

00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:09.550
Kind of laughed, he
said no, you can man.

00:17:09.550 --> 00:17:11.849
Just try it.

00:17:11.849 --> 00:17:13.859
So he wrote down
some instructions,

00:17:13.859 --> 00:17:15.369
left some sourdough with me.

00:17:15.369 --> 00:17:23.599
And a week later I tried it,
and just was totally in love,

00:17:23.599 --> 00:17:28.700
and haven't been able
to stop ever since.

00:17:28.700 --> 00:17:33.590
And I'll go through, what
I'll do is I'll maybe,

00:17:33.590 --> 00:17:35.220
I'll go through my slide show.

00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:39.120
And I'll probably jump around
and jump through, speed it

00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:41.350
up a little bit
quicker than usual.

00:17:41.350 --> 00:17:43.720
I'm not used to doing the
slide show after we've all

00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:47.300
seen the movie, so I'll try
to keep from boring you.

00:17:50.670 --> 00:18:00.770
This is my first blog
entry in August of 2010.

00:18:00.770 --> 00:18:03.350
Holy moly, it's happening.

00:18:03.350 --> 00:18:04.210
Hi friends.

00:18:04.210 --> 00:18:05.930
Holy moly, it's happening.

00:18:05.930 --> 00:18:08.710
I'm selling bread,
and people like it.

00:18:08.710 --> 00:18:11.070
This is so totally
rad, it's making

00:18:11.070 --> 00:18:14.640
my eyes pop out of my face.

00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:18.320
Not really, but I'm pumped up.

00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:25.690
And so it really was-- and
this is just a few months ago.

00:18:25.690 --> 00:18:28.960
Went from that first blog
entry of baking at home

00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:34.470
to being on billboards and bus
stops around San Fransisco.

00:18:34.470 --> 00:18:36.510
This is unreal.

00:18:36.510 --> 00:18:39.640
This is for this
great company here

00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:41.370
in San Fransisco
called Good Eggs.

00:18:41.370 --> 00:18:43.430
They're like an online
farmer's market,

00:18:43.430 --> 00:18:46.450
and I sell a lot of
my bread through them.

00:18:46.450 --> 00:18:50.230
And they were really
influential and helpful to me

00:18:50.230 --> 00:18:54.400
early on in my business,
because-- actually,

00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:57.770
and some of you may--
I feel like you,

00:18:57.770 --> 00:19:01.110
and maybe some others of
you, I actually-- Google

00:19:01.110 --> 00:19:02.960
was super helpful.

00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:05.820
Yeah, super helpful
to my business

00:19:05.820 --> 00:19:08.770
early on, because I
was doing, I started

00:19:08.770 --> 00:19:11.270
selling my bread through
a bread subscription.

00:19:11.270 --> 00:19:15.620
So I'd say hey, give me $20, and
I'll bake you a loaf per week

00:19:15.620 --> 00:19:17.330
for four weeks.

00:19:17.330 --> 00:19:20.129
So I started doing that
just word of mouth,

00:19:20.129 --> 00:19:21.920
and then I had an
article written about it.

00:19:21.920 --> 00:19:24.500
And so Stranger
started doing it,

00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:29.360
and then I started doing
it at some businesses

00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:30.360
around the city.

00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:34.235
And I had a really good
experience doing that here

00:19:34.235 --> 00:19:37.590
at Google where some days
I would drop off like,

00:19:37.590 --> 00:19:41.090
50 loaves of bread.

00:19:41.090 --> 00:19:44.160
And that was one of
a handful of things

00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:46.600
that made me feel
like, holy shit.

00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:48.785
This might be for real.

00:19:53.470 --> 00:19:58.590
And so this was in, this
is Thanksgiving of 2010.

00:19:58.590 --> 00:20:01.400
I had that article
written about me,

00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:03.090
and I was just baking at home.

00:20:03.090 --> 00:20:05.240
Kind of selling
the bread because I

00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:06.930
had to do something
with it, because I

00:20:06.930 --> 00:20:08.970
was making too
much of it to eat.

00:20:08.970 --> 00:20:10.510
I had to give away.

00:20:10.510 --> 00:20:13.940
And I was selling it
at my friend's shop

00:20:13.940 --> 00:20:15.660
in the mission, Gravel &amp; Gold.

00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:21.450
And someone came in
there and saw the bread

00:20:21.450 --> 00:20:25.612
and tried it, and liked it,
and saw my blog and said hey,

00:20:25.612 --> 00:20:27.195
we want to write an
article about you,

00:20:27.195 --> 00:20:29.242
and I was like--
(WHISPERING) you

00:20:29.242 --> 00:20:30.710
want to write an
article about me?

00:20:30.710 --> 00:20:32.490
My bread?

00:20:32.490 --> 00:20:34.060
OK, let's do it.

00:20:34.060 --> 00:20:36.940
And so they wrote an
article, and all of sudden I

00:20:36.940 --> 00:20:39.235
got a bunch of
emails from people

00:20:39.235 --> 00:20:41.360
I didn't know saying hey,
we read about your bread.

00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:42.790
We want some.

00:20:42.790 --> 00:20:45.030
And I was like, OK.

00:20:45.030 --> 00:20:47.100
Wasn't really ready for
that, but Kathy actually

00:20:47.100 --> 00:20:51.050
helped me set up-- what was it.

00:20:51.050 --> 00:20:52.666
A Google forum?

00:20:52.666 --> 00:20:56.010
Yeah, so we set
up a Google forum

00:20:56.010 --> 00:20:58.050
so people could sign
up for the bread

00:20:58.050 --> 00:20:59.820
and I got their
money through Paypal.

00:20:59.820 --> 00:21:04.134
And then on Thanksgiving Day
I baked 60 loaves of bread

00:21:04.134 --> 00:21:04.800
in my home oven.

00:21:07.970 --> 00:21:09.190
There it is, right there.

00:21:09.190 --> 00:21:10.981
And it's funny looking
at this picture now.

00:21:10.981 --> 00:21:12.510
I'm like, that
bread totally sucks.

00:21:12.510 --> 00:21:16.390
But I think at the time it
was the best I could do.

00:21:21.085 --> 00:21:25.710
The type of things I do now
is, my previous job actually

00:21:25.710 --> 00:21:28.830
was working at UC Berkeley
at the Lawrence Hall Science

00:21:28.830 --> 00:21:31.630
on elementary and middle
school science curriculum.

00:21:31.630 --> 00:21:36.870
And so I've got a love of
children and education,

00:21:36.870 --> 00:21:40.036
and so we have
groups of children

00:21:40.036 --> 00:21:41.660
come and visit us
every once in awhile.

00:21:41.660 --> 00:21:43.076
And we take them
around the bakery

00:21:43.076 --> 00:21:46.993
and show them our huge oven,
and then when you press a button

00:21:46.993 --> 00:21:49.019
it shoots steam out the front.

00:21:49.019 --> 00:21:49.810
It's very exciting.

00:21:53.660 --> 00:21:58.310
But so I'm baking at home,
and I bake those 60 loaves

00:21:58.310 --> 00:21:59.710
on Thanksgiving morning.

00:21:59.710 --> 00:22:05.662
And it's very exciting
for me, and I say OK.

00:22:05.662 --> 00:22:06.620
I'm going to go for it.

00:22:06.620 --> 00:22:10.576
And I quit my job,
quit my day job.

00:22:10.576 --> 00:22:13.100
And I'm thinking, I was
making a little bit of money

00:22:13.100 --> 00:22:15.980
on bread, because I
was baking it at home.

00:22:15.980 --> 00:22:18.356
I did have any employees,
I didn't have any expenses.

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:26.160
So if it costs you
a buck in flour,

00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:29.380
and then you make it
into a loaf of bread,

00:22:29.380 --> 00:22:30.980
make a few bucks right there.

00:22:30.980 --> 00:22:33.420
It takes time, but
the moral of the story

00:22:33.420 --> 00:22:37.332
is we're making it a
little bit of money,

00:22:37.332 --> 00:22:39.040
but nowhere near enough
money to actually

00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:42.260
live-- in San
Fransisco, especially.

00:22:42.260 --> 00:22:45.880
And so, so I started
bartending at Amnesia.

00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:47.764
And what I would
do there when-- I

00:22:47.764 --> 00:22:49.430
didn't know that I
was going to do this,

00:22:49.430 --> 00:22:52.980
but it's just turned out to
make sense-- is I'd bake bread

00:22:52.980 --> 00:22:55.530
at home, or I'd
bake it, I also met

00:22:55.530 --> 00:22:58.590
this is really great, generous
guy who owns a restaurant.

00:22:58.590 --> 00:23:01.604
A few restaurants
in the East Bay.

00:23:01.604 --> 00:23:03.520
And we're having a party
actually Friday night

00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:05.478
at Penrose, any of you
are interested in coming

00:23:05.478 --> 00:23:07.800
out and partying.

00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:10.390
Charlie Hallowell,
and anyway, I'd

00:23:10.390 --> 00:23:13.870
take the bread that I baked,
either at home or at Pizzaiolo

00:23:13.870 --> 00:23:17.810
and bring it into the bar,
and hide it under the bar.

00:23:17.810 --> 00:23:20.050
But I'd like, cut
up a few samples.

00:23:20.050 --> 00:23:23.187
And so I'd be like, being a
bartender, and they'd come up

00:23:23.187 --> 00:23:25.020
and they'd see the bread
they'd have a bite.

00:23:25.020 --> 00:23:26.228
And they'd say, this is good.

00:23:26.228 --> 00:23:27.230
Where is this?

00:23:27.230 --> 00:23:30.850
Where is this from?

00:23:30.850 --> 00:23:34.660
I know where you can get a
whole loaf of that stuff.

00:23:34.660 --> 00:23:37.750
You got $5?

00:23:37.750 --> 00:23:40.955
Then pretty soon, people
would come into the bar,

00:23:40.955 --> 00:23:44.530
and I'd know as
soon they walked in.

00:23:44.530 --> 00:23:47.156
Because they'd walk in
and they'd be like--

00:23:47.156 --> 00:23:49.150
and they'd come up
and they be like--

00:23:49.150 --> 00:23:51.484
is this where I
can get the bread?

00:23:51.484 --> 00:23:54.410
Yeah, it is.

00:23:54.410 --> 00:23:56.310
And I did that for
a little while,

00:23:56.310 --> 00:24:02.380
but did that 'til April, 2011.

00:24:02.380 --> 00:24:06.210
I wasn't cut out for
being a bartender.

00:24:06.210 --> 00:24:08.370
Baking was more to
my liking and so

00:24:08.370 --> 00:24:11.615
I said OK, I'm going
to stop the bartending,

00:24:11.615 --> 00:24:12.490
and really go for it.

00:24:12.490 --> 00:24:14.220
And I started baking full time.

00:24:14.220 --> 00:24:16.030
So I was baking at
Mission Pie, which

00:24:16.030 --> 00:24:18.660
is a pie bakery in The Mission.

00:24:18.660 --> 00:24:21.160
I just walked in there
one day and asked them

00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:23.070
if they'd let me
use their space,

00:24:23.070 --> 00:24:25.990
rent space from them in
order to run my business.

00:24:25.990 --> 00:24:29.230
And they were generous
enough to say yes.

00:24:29.230 --> 00:24:32.030
And I was doing that,
and baking at Pizzaiolo.

00:24:32.030 --> 00:24:34.080
So I was always baking
three days a week,

00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:37.935
and I was doing it all
myself, and delivering it,

00:24:37.935 --> 00:24:43.630
and I was probably making
around 250 loaves a week

00:24:43.630 --> 00:24:44.860
or so that point.

00:24:48.010 --> 00:24:49.900
This is me at Mission Pie.

00:24:49.900 --> 00:24:54.450
Mission Pie was so influential,
because it allowed me

00:24:54.450 --> 00:24:56.431
to-- you know, I
was baking at home,

00:24:56.431 --> 00:24:58.680
and I was baking in this
wood fired oven at Pizzaoilo.

00:25:01.580 --> 00:25:05.010
Neither of those ovens were
really meant for bread baking.

00:25:05.010 --> 00:25:06.440
They weren't bread ovens.

00:25:06.440 --> 00:25:08.910
The oven at Mission
Pie was a bread oven,

00:25:08.910 --> 00:25:11.110
and it made a world
of difference.

00:25:11.110 --> 00:25:13.380
You could press a button,
and then the chamber

00:25:13.380 --> 00:25:15.020
will fill up with steam.

00:25:15.020 --> 00:25:18.860
And steam is really helpful
for bread baking, which

00:25:18.860 --> 00:25:22.310
you can do in your
home oven just as good

00:25:22.310 --> 00:25:24.750
just with a baking
stone and a metal pot.

00:25:24.750 --> 00:25:28.340
And the steam that's created
from the baking loaf of bread

00:25:28.340 --> 00:25:33.260
is actually perfect for creating
steam saturated environment,

00:25:33.260 --> 00:25:36.230
which will allow you to
get the most oven spring,

00:25:36.230 --> 00:25:42.048
and get a nice crispy crust,
and really beautiful coloration.

00:25:42.048 --> 00:25:43.310
So this is near Burning Man.

00:25:45.860 --> 00:25:53.290
Just shooting a flame
thrower, pretty sweet.

00:25:53.290 --> 00:25:55.960
That was one of the things
that was very appealing to me

00:25:55.960 --> 00:26:02.470
about doing bread, and
turning it into my life,

00:26:02.470 --> 00:26:07.840
was that I was able
to jump right into it

00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:13.300
and immediately be my
own boss, because I

00:26:13.300 --> 00:26:17.780
had my own ideas about how I
wanted to do the whole thing.

00:26:17.780 --> 00:26:23.260
And the fact that I could
just start putting them

00:26:23.260 --> 00:26:28.160
into practice right away
was really amazing to me.

00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:30.490
And it definitely
was-- I don't think

00:26:30.490 --> 00:26:34.250
I would have made it if
I got a job in a bakery,

00:26:34.250 --> 00:26:39.887
or had to spend several
years in baking school.

00:26:39.887 --> 00:26:41.970
Doing things like this was
really important to me,

00:26:41.970 --> 00:26:44.000
apparently.

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:48.080
So this is the room that Jeremy
from Four Barrel brought me to.

00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:50.390
And he said hey, I've
got an idea on the space.

00:26:50.390 --> 00:26:52.500
I want to work on
something with you.

00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:58.700
And he brings me here,
and I'm like, oh, OK.

00:26:58.700 --> 00:27:02.760
Looks like we've got a lot of
work to do on this place, huh?

00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:08.045
And we did, as I painfully
illustrated in the movie.

00:27:08.045 --> 00:27:09.770
It took us about
a year and a half

00:27:09.770 --> 00:27:13.180
from start to finish
to build out The Mill.

00:27:13.180 --> 00:27:15.940
But it's done now.

00:27:15.940 --> 00:27:19.240
These are just some trips from
my travels with my wife, Cathy.

00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:26.270
This is Angkor Wat, and
doing some deep water soloing

00:27:26.270 --> 00:27:33.270
in an island in Thailand,
jumping into a river in Lao.

00:27:36.020 --> 00:27:37.520
That wasn't supposed
to be in there.

00:27:40.830 --> 00:27:43.510
So I had that trip,
we had that trip

00:27:43.510 --> 00:27:46.630
planned before I got
involved in The Mill,

00:27:46.630 --> 00:27:47.840
building out The Mill.

00:27:47.840 --> 00:27:50.520
And so we stuck to
it, but I came back

00:27:50.520 --> 00:27:54.900
and we had a lot of work to do.

00:27:54.900 --> 00:27:59.155
And I did as much
myself as I could.

00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:05.420
This is me doing a little
grinding on the cart

00:28:05.420 --> 00:28:08.240
that we used for coffee service
in The Mill for a little while

00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:09.875
before the whole
space was built out.

00:28:13.020 --> 00:28:16.060
Now the space is built out.

00:28:16.060 --> 00:28:18.370
Top cellar is small.

00:28:18.370 --> 00:28:21.960
Small, beautiful children.

00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:26.210
No, what's really amazing
to me, one of the things

00:28:26.210 --> 00:28:28.420
that's really
amazing is that we've

00:28:28.420 --> 00:28:33.680
got a really solid customer
base of folks who come there

00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:35.010
on a really regular basis.

00:28:35.010 --> 00:28:39.420
So it really feels like we're
members of the community.

00:28:39.420 --> 00:28:43.410
And that's really nourishing
to me, to lots of other people.

00:28:47.670 --> 00:28:53.450
About three weeks
after we opened

00:28:53.450 --> 00:28:56.000
we had to photograph
the cookbook,

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:58.420
which was not good timing.

00:28:58.420 --> 00:29:00.160
But what can you do?

00:29:00.160 --> 00:29:03.350
We'd already been pushing
it back for weeks and weeks,

00:29:03.350 --> 00:29:08.320
so at that point, I
was hell bent on baking

00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:10.290
every loaf of bread myself.

00:29:10.290 --> 00:29:16.440
And so I was still doing that
at that point, which was silly.

00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:19.130
A silly idea to think that I
could bake every loaf of bread

00:29:19.130 --> 00:29:23.020
myself, but I didn't know
how to do anything else.

00:29:23.020 --> 00:29:26.040
So I'd bake in the
morning, and then we'd

00:29:26.040 --> 00:29:27.610
take off in the afternoon.

00:29:27.610 --> 00:29:30.934
And we shot the whole thing
over the course of a week.

00:29:30.934 --> 00:29:32.350
Erin Kunkel was
really, really fun

00:29:32.350 --> 00:29:33.600
to work with, really talented.

00:29:36.740 --> 00:29:40.430
So that was a terrible, terrible
thing that happened to me.

00:29:40.430 --> 00:29:44.160
Two months after we opened
The Mill, I was on a bike ride

00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:45.830
through Golden Gate Park.

00:29:45.830 --> 00:29:51.010
And the fork on my bicycle
broke, and I fell on my face.

00:29:51.010 --> 00:29:59.590
And it was very challenging,
but it was actually

00:29:59.590 --> 00:30:00.940
a blessing in disguise.

00:30:00.940 --> 00:30:04.510
Because I was
trying to do things

00:30:04.510 --> 00:30:06.450
like bake every
single loaf of bread

00:30:06.450 --> 00:30:11.800
myself, which is a
relic from the way

00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:14.360
the business was
when it was just me.

00:30:14.360 --> 00:30:17.910
But now it wasn't just me, it
was a whole team of people.

00:30:17.910 --> 00:30:23.270
And a really talented team
of people that as soon

00:30:23.270 --> 00:30:29.860
as I had to let go of the
business, it flourished.

00:30:29.860 --> 00:30:31.870
And I didn't let go completely.

00:30:31.870 --> 00:30:34.930
But I took 10 days
away from the bakery,

00:30:34.930 --> 00:30:37.750
because I was like
in La La Land.

00:30:37.750 --> 00:30:43.570
And I came back, and
everything was great.

00:30:43.570 --> 00:30:47.160
And people were on
some level, they

00:30:47.160 --> 00:30:52.790
were grateful that they
were able to take the reins

00:30:52.790 --> 00:30:53.890
and run with them.

00:30:53.890 --> 00:30:58.070
And it's still so amazing to me.

00:30:58.070 --> 00:31:02.710
I'm filled with gratitude
when I go into that space

00:31:02.710 --> 00:31:08.850
and see everybody working
so hard on this project.

00:31:08.850 --> 00:31:11.290
It really fills me with love.

00:31:13.880 --> 00:31:15.420
These are loafers, by the way.

00:31:18.801 --> 00:31:20.920
And this is just a
pretty loaf of bread.

00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:25.720
The bread is not
always, baking bread--

00:31:25.720 --> 00:31:27.570
it depends what your
standards are, right?

00:31:27.570 --> 00:31:30.590
What your end vision is
for whatever you're doing.

00:31:30.590 --> 00:31:35.040
But we've got a very particular
thing that we're going for.

00:31:35.040 --> 00:31:37.360
And it's very hard to get there.

00:31:37.360 --> 00:31:41.200
There are many days
where the bread is still

00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:43.740
wonderfully
delicious and pretty,

00:31:43.740 --> 00:31:48.790
and I think 98% of people
don't care or notice

00:31:48.790 --> 00:31:51.230
the difference from
one day to another.

00:31:51.230 --> 00:32:01.300
But we obviously do, and
I'm almost never satisfied

00:32:01.300 --> 00:32:03.890
with how the bread comes out.

00:32:03.890 --> 00:32:05.440
And that's one of
the things that

00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:09.090
keeps it really interesting,
is that it's very,

00:32:09.090 --> 00:32:11.000
it's a finicky beast.

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:13.030
But this one came
out pretty good.

00:32:15.640 --> 00:32:19.436
And we started doing pizza
on Monday nights at The Mill.

00:32:19.436 --> 00:32:21.310
So every Monday night,
we do a different type

00:32:21.310 --> 00:32:27.190
of vegetarian pizza, and it's
been really out of control.

00:32:27.190 --> 00:32:29.050
So feel free to swing
through if you want.

00:32:29.050 --> 00:32:32.464
There's a whole chapter
in the book on pizza.

00:32:32.464 --> 00:32:33.880
So without further
ado, I think we

00:32:33.880 --> 00:32:35.921
should start talking about
the book a little bit.

00:32:35.921 --> 00:32:38.650
Or I'll talk a little
bit about this, toast.

00:32:38.650 --> 00:32:43.050
So I don't know if any of you
were privy to the whole toast

00:32:43.050 --> 00:32:44.430
thing that happened.

00:32:44.430 --> 00:32:49.690
But we got a lot of flack
for our toast and ruining San

00:32:49.690 --> 00:32:52.410
Francisco.

00:32:52.410 --> 00:32:55.180
I'm glad that that's blown over.

00:32:55.180 --> 00:32:59.510
We make toast at The Mill,
we think it tastes good.

00:32:59.510 --> 00:33:04.350
Come try it if you like, but
don't if you don't want to.

00:33:04.350 --> 00:33:05.740
And this is The Mill.

00:33:05.740 --> 00:33:10.160
So it's up on Divisidero St,
between Fulton and Grove.

00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:15.200
I'm there most the time,
come say hey if you want.

00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:22.180
So the book "Josey Baker Bread"
is a beginner's bread baking

00:33:22.180 --> 00:33:24.980
cookbook, and the
first two chapters

00:33:24.980 --> 00:33:27.780
are a series of
recipes that are meant

00:33:27.780 --> 00:33:29.200
to be followed sequentially.

00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:30.600
So you start at the beginning.

00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:32.860
You do recipe one,
two, three, four,

00:33:32.860 --> 00:33:37.100
and each one builds on
the previous recipe.

00:33:37.100 --> 00:33:41.630
And so the reason I did that
was because I was hearing from,

00:33:41.630 --> 00:33:43.700
and I had the same
experience myself,

00:33:43.700 --> 00:33:47.040
but hearing from lots
of people that they're

00:33:47.040 --> 00:33:49.832
overwhelmed when you open
up a bread baking cookbook.

00:33:49.832 --> 00:33:51.790
You're overwhelmed at
the idea of baking bread.

00:33:51.790 --> 00:33:58.020
It's this mystical thing,
involves yeast-- terrifying.

00:33:58.020 --> 00:34:03.440
But what I tried to do is
start at the beginning,

00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:07.010
and only give you the
information that you really

00:34:07.010 --> 00:34:08.010
need.

00:34:08.010 --> 00:34:14.090
Not get all crazy about
temperature, and time,

00:34:14.090 --> 00:34:17.020
and you need to shape
the loaf this way.

00:34:17.020 --> 00:34:20.090
And there's a bulk
ferment, and then a proof.

00:34:20.090 --> 00:34:22.900
But you can retard the
proof, and all these things

00:34:22.900 --> 00:34:25.840
that when you're first
starting out it's like-- whoa.

00:34:25.840 --> 00:34:27.719
I just want to make bread here.

00:34:27.719 --> 00:34:30.750
And so that's
where we start out,

00:34:30.750 --> 00:34:34.280
with a really, really basic loaf
with just bread flour, water,

00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:34.900
salt, yeast.

00:34:34.900 --> 00:34:38.250
You don't even need it at all.

00:34:38.250 --> 00:34:39.949
And it's really flexible.

00:34:39.949 --> 00:34:44.159
You could leave the dough in
your fridge for like a week,

00:34:44.159 --> 00:34:47.819
or less than a week,
as long as you want.

00:34:47.819 --> 00:34:49.860
And then you shape it into
a loaf and bake it up.

00:34:49.860 --> 00:34:53.920
And then the next recipe
introduces a few other things.

00:34:53.920 --> 00:34:55.790
We introduce whole wheat flour.

00:34:55.790 --> 00:35:02.550
We introduce the idea of mixing
the dough in multiple stages,

00:35:02.550 --> 00:35:03.550
and so on, and so forth.

00:35:03.550 --> 00:35:05.500
And the second chapter
is all about sourdough.

00:35:05.500 --> 00:35:08.330
I teach you how to make
your own sourdough culture.

00:35:08.330 --> 00:35:12.380
And then the rest of the book
goes into all sorts of areas.

00:35:12.380 --> 00:35:14.340
We've making bread
with different grains,

00:35:14.340 --> 00:35:19.430
making pizza, pocket breads.

00:35:19.430 --> 00:35:22.630
The last chapter is
sweets-- like cookies,

00:35:22.630 --> 00:35:26.800
and fruit crumbles,
and cornbread,

00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:29.810
cream scones, that
kind of stuff.

00:35:29.810 --> 00:35:33.400
But it's been great, I've been
getting really good feedback.

00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:40.852
So happy to answer any questions
anybody has about anything.

00:35:40.852 --> 00:35:42.310
AUDIENCE: When I
bake bread at home

00:35:42.310 --> 00:35:47.120
I feel like what's really
helpful to me is to be tasting

00:35:47.120 --> 00:35:50.260
a bread and being really
picky about how will

00:35:50.260 --> 00:35:53.450
the results are, and
really just doing

00:35:53.450 --> 00:35:55.720
ridiculously picky about it.

00:35:55.720 --> 00:35:58.576
How do you assess how
good your bread is?

00:35:58.576 --> 00:36:00.950
How do you, like what are
things that you're looking for,

00:36:00.950 --> 00:36:02.520
and stuff like that?

00:36:02.520 --> 00:36:05.052
JOSEY BAKER: Yeah,
good question.

00:36:05.052 --> 00:36:06.635
Yeah, I mean the
first thing obviously

00:36:06.635 --> 00:36:08.580
that you can tell
is what it looks

00:36:08.580 --> 00:36:14.790
like from the outside,
which can be very deceiving.

00:36:14.790 --> 00:36:17.700
And that's a personal thing,
that's your own aesthetic,

00:36:17.700 --> 00:36:19.480
and what you're going for.

00:36:19.480 --> 00:36:23.820
But one thing that
we go for at The Mill

00:36:23.820 --> 00:36:26.700
and that I suggest to
you go for in your home

00:36:26.700 --> 00:36:29.760
is to go for a bold bake.

00:36:29.760 --> 00:36:34.860
And so that means baking your
bread until the crust is really

00:36:34.860 --> 00:36:36.940
the whole spectrum of
colors, but everywhere

00:36:36.940 --> 00:36:40.270
from really dark
brown to really light.

00:36:40.270 --> 00:36:43.864
And you get that spectrum
mostly in the ear

00:36:43.864 --> 00:36:46.030
that's created from the
slash that you give it right

00:36:46.030 --> 00:36:47.446
before the bread
goes in the oven.

00:36:50.200 --> 00:36:55.770
But in order for your
bread to not be dried out

00:36:55.770 --> 00:36:57.600
by baking it that
much, you need to have

00:36:57.600 --> 00:37:00.880
kind of a lot of water
in your bread dough.

00:37:00.880 --> 00:37:05.080
And so that helps the
interior of your bread

00:37:05.080 --> 00:37:08.120
stay nice and moist while
the outside can get nice,

00:37:08.120 --> 00:37:11.520
and flavorful, and crunchy.

00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:16.160
So we've got the loaf,
so we go for a bold bake.

00:37:16.160 --> 00:37:21.280
And what usually
comes along with that

00:37:21.280 --> 00:37:23.295
is some crunch to your crust.

00:37:23.295 --> 00:37:24.830
It's our preference.

00:37:24.830 --> 00:37:29.030
We're talking about sourdough,
hearth loaves, specifically.

00:37:29.030 --> 00:37:36.130
Then you cut into it, and I
like to have some irregularity

00:37:36.130 --> 00:37:39.540
to the crumb, the crumb being
just the interior of the bread.

00:37:39.540 --> 00:37:40.720
Crust and crumb, right?

00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:44.010
Crumb is the inside, the
crust is the outside.

00:37:44.010 --> 00:37:49.880
And that is where I can get
very particular about what

00:37:49.880 --> 00:37:52.780
it looks like in there.

00:37:52.780 --> 00:37:58.460
More than the pattern
of the bubbles inside,

00:37:58.460 --> 00:38:02.330
I want the inside
to be supple, soft,

00:38:02.330 --> 00:38:05.260
and to have the
appearance to have

00:38:05.260 --> 00:38:07.060
a little bit of
glossiness, which

00:38:07.060 --> 00:38:11.780
means that the starches
are fully gelatinized.

00:38:11.780 --> 00:38:13.420
Gelated, I'm not sure
which is correct,

00:38:13.420 --> 00:38:16.215
but just means that the
bread is fully baked.

00:38:19.270 --> 00:38:23.300
Having a good amount of
oven spring on the bread,

00:38:23.300 --> 00:38:26.940
and so that means that when
you put the loaf into the oven

00:38:26.940 --> 00:38:29.860
it's going to undergo a period
of rapid expansion, which is it

00:38:29.860 --> 00:38:32.590
mostly the gases that are
already in the bubbles

00:38:32.590 --> 00:38:34.390
in there expanding.

00:38:34.390 --> 00:38:37.550
And so that expansion
is called oven spring.

00:38:37.550 --> 00:38:41.527
And so if when you slash your
loaf-- if you do it well,

00:38:41.527 --> 00:38:43.110
if you've done
everything well, you'll

00:38:43.110 --> 00:38:44.850
have a nice amount
of oven spring

00:38:44.850 --> 00:38:52.490
which will lead to
something along these lines.

00:38:52.490 --> 00:38:56.070
Which you see--
this was closed up

00:38:56.070 --> 00:38:57.740
when we put it into the oven.

00:38:57.740 --> 00:39:02.560
And I ran a razor like
that just along this part.

00:39:02.560 --> 00:39:07.650
And so this was the cut I made,
lines up with here, and here.

00:39:07.650 --> 00:39:10.400
And all of this is tearing.

00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:13.660
The dough ripped itself apart
because it had so much vitality

00:39:13.660 --> 00:39:15.760
in it.

00:39:15.760 --> 00:39:22.630
So I like some of oven spring,
but it's a personal question.

00:39:22.630 --> 00:39:25.650
Everybody can decide
for themselves.

00:39:25.650 --> 00:39:27.715
AUDIENCE: So when you
started, you first baked

00:39:27.715 --> 00:39:29.256
your first loaf of
bread, were you're

00:39:29.256 --> 00:39:30.980
looking for a life change?

00:39:30.980 --> 00:39:33.596
Like were you happy doing
what you were doing?

00:39:33.596 --> 00:39:35.095
JOSEY BAKER: That's
a good question.

00:39:37.710 --> 00:39:41.520
When I started my work at
the Lawrence Hall of Science,

00:39:41.520 --> 00:39:45.020
that was my dream job.

00:39:45.020 --> 00:39:48.510
And I totally loved it for
the first several years

00:39:48.510 --> 00:39:51.650
that I was there.

00:39:51.650 --> 00:39:54.880
And then I started to think
about doing something else,

00:39:54.880 --> 00:39:56.920
and I didn't know what.

00:39:56.920 --> 00:39:59.590
And actually, I was
really close to going back

00:39:59.590 --> 00:40:02.330
to school for psychology.

00:40:02.330 --> 00:40:06.310
I was going to apply to
CIS here in the city,

00:40:06.310 --> 00:40:10.790
and I missed the deadline
for applications.

00:40:10.790 --> 00:40:13.930
And when I realized it was
going to be a whole other year

00:40:13.930 --> 00:40:18.300
before I could go,
I realized that that

00:40:18.300 --> 00:40:20.610
wasn't the right
fit for me either.

00:40:20.610 --> 00:40:24.160
And so I wanted to
do something else,

00:40:24.160 --> 00:40:28.220
but I wasn't sure what
until I started baking.

00:40:28.220 --> 00:40:31.190
And then it was really
not even like oh, this

00:40:31.190 --> 00:40:33.000
can be my next job.

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:36.820
It was just oh man, I've got
to be doing this all the time,

00:40:36.820 --> 00:40:40.750
and then figuring out how
to make it into a business

00:40:40.750 --> 00:40:41.970
came after the fact.

00:40:44.500 --> 00:40:48.650
It was sweet, I
lucked out I think.

00:40:48.650 --> 00:40:52.470
AUDIENCE: So it seems
like bread has recently

00:40:52.470 --> 00:40:55.450
gotten some fame about it.

00:40:55.450 --> 00:40:57.880
Which is great, because
I love eating bread,

00:40:57.880 --> 00:40:59.550
and I love making bread.

00:40:59.550 --> 00:41:01.830
And it seems like every year
or so the New York Times

00:41:01.830 --> 00:41:03.550
will run this big
article talking about--

00:41:03.550 --> 00:41:04.370
JOSEY BAKER: Yeah.

00:41:04.370 --> 00:41:06.090
AUDIENCE: --Jim Lahey
and no knead bread,

00:41:06.090 --> 00:41:07.930
or Chad Robertson from Tartine.

00:41:07.930 --> 00:41:09.110
JOSEY BAKER: Yeah.

00:41:09.110 --> 00:41:10.800
AUDIENCE: This maybe
an unfair question,

00:41:10.800 --> 00:41:15.300
but what do you think your
personal angle to bread is,

00:41:15.300 --> 00:41:18.314
and how it differs from some
of the other bread celebrities?

00:41:18.314 --> 00:41:19.980
JOSEY BAKER: No,
that's a cool question.

00:41:19.980 --> 00:41:21.640
Yeah, I appreciate it.

00:41:21.640 --> 00:41:23.080
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:41:23.080 --> 00:41:24.700
FEMALE SPEAKER:
He wears loafers.

00:41:24.700 --> 00:41:26.930
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah,
which is awesome.

00:41:26.930 --> 00:41:29.990
Which I would do if it
didn't mean throwing away

00:41:29.990 --> 00:41:30.900
three hours of work.

00:41:30.900 --> 00:41:34.240
JOSEY BAKER: I
know what you mean.

00:41:34.240 --> 00:41:37.410
Yeah, I'm just starting
to wonder that myself.

00:41:37.410 --> 00:41:41.400
What is my angle in
this whole thing?

00:41:41.400 --> 00:41:46.350
And in a way, I feel like
other people would actually

00:41:46.350 --> 00:41:48.890
be better suited to
answer that than me,

00:41:48.890 --> 00:41:51.970
because like I just said.

00:41:51.970 --> 00:41:54.600
It really was not-- like
I didn't have any business

00:41:54.600 --> 00:41:56.430
plan to the whole thing.

00:41:56.430 --> 00:41:58.675
It was not a
calculated endeavor.

00:42:01.280 --> 00:42:06.210
It was pretty improvisational,
the whole thing.

00:42:06.210 --> 00:42:09.970
But what I'm realizing, and
this is like what I just said,

00:42:09.970 --> 00:42:12.690
is that other people-- what
I'm hearing from lots of people

00:42:12.690 --> 00:42:18.420
tell me is that what they
value about my approach

00:42:18.420 --> 00:42:23.920
to the whole thing is
that it's casual, and fun,

00:42:23.920 --> 00:42:34.440
and that it takes the terror
out of bread baking, which

00:42:34.440 --> 00:42:38.940
for whatever reason-- I
think bread baking has

00:42:38.940 --> 00:42:41.130
a certain mystique
around it right now

00:42:41.130 --> 00:42:43.680
which is funny,
because back in the day

00:42:43.680 --> 00:42:46.770
it was something that
everybody did at home

00:42:46.770 --> 00:42:50.800
and there was no was
no hullabaloo about it.

00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:55.140
You just baked because
that's the way you got bread.

00:42:55.140 --> 00:43:00.350
And so what I found through
the process of bread

00:43:00.350 --> 00:43:05.570
baking as a hobby was
I found a lot of peace

00:43:05.570 --> 00:43:08.910
in the act of making bread.

00:43:08.910 --> 00:43:14.160
And then I find a lot of
joy in the connections

00:43:14.160 --> 00:43:18.580
that breaking bread can
foster between people.

00:43:18.580 --> 00:43:24.990
And so the more people that can
find those things through it,

00:43:24.990 --> 00:43:26.380
I think the better.

00:43:26.380 --> 00:43:31.370
Because it's really, to me
it's a pretty magical thing

00:43:31.370 --> 00:43:33.440
to engage in.

00:43:33.440 --> 00:43:37.675
So maybe something
along those lines?

00:43:37.675 --> 00:43:40.125
I don't know.

00:43:40.125 --> 00:43:41.500
AUDIENCE: Great
to have you back.

00:43:41.500 --> 00:43:42.541
JOSEY BAKER: Thanks, man.

00:43:42.541 --> 00:43:47.090
AUDIENCE: I was lucky enough
to be a proud and joyous eater

00:43:47.090 --> 00:43:49.294
of the bicycle delivered
loaves that were here.

00:43:49.294 --> 00:43:50.460
JOSEY BAKER: I remember you.

00:43:50.460 --> 00:43:52.501
AUDIENCE: You buy many of
them, and then actually

00:43:52.501 --> 00:43:55.849
give them to friends and so
forth who just enjoyed so much.

00:43:55.849 --> 00:43:57.640
So one of the things
that was evident then,

00:43:57.640 --> 00:43:59.930
is still evident now is
your sort of passion.

00:43:59.930 --> 00:44:04.650
And sort of the joy you
take in what you're doing.

00:44:08.690 --> 00:44:12.180
But you also say like,
1 in 50 set of loaves.

00:44:12.180 --> 00:44:13.730
Like OK, this is good bread.

00:44:13.730 --> 00:44:16.370
Otherwise, nah.

00:44:16.370 --> 00:44:21.650
And then you also just now
spoke to sort of the peace,

00:44:21.650 --> 00:44:24.640
or perhaps even meditative
quality to the act itself.

00:44:24.640 --> 00:44:26.380
And I'm sort of curious.

00:44:26.380 --> 00:44:29.550
OK, so that's a really
interesting combination

00:44:29.550 --> 00:44:33.830
of feelings about something.

00:44:33.830 --> 00:44:37.285
Like if I succeeded 1 in 50
times, I might be saying, hey,

00:44:37.285 --> 00:44:38.910
maybe I should be
doing something else.

00:44:41.670 --> 00:44:44.670
Admittedly, your tastes are now
very particular because you're

00:44:44.670 --> 00:44:46.700
an expert, but nonetheless.

00:44:46.700 --> 00:44:48.530
So I'm curious if you
could sort of tease

00:44:48.530 --> 00:44:53.880
that, sort of what brings you
to the immense amount of work

00:44:53.880 --> 00:44:57.220
involved in what you've
accomplished so far.

00:44:57.220 --> 00:44:59.420
I mean, that's very evident
in all aspects of it.

00:44:59.420 --> 00:45:04.130
So I'm curious, like why
did despair not drag you

00:45:04.130 --> 00:45:05.659
into the floor?

00:45:05.659 --> 00:45:07.200
JOSEY BAKER: That's
a great question.

00:45:07.200 --> 00:45:09.490
I'll blab a little bit.

00:45:09.490 --> 00:45:12.750
You just keep me on track, OK?

00:45:12.750 --> 00:45:15.460
I think these days
actually, one of the things,

00:45:15.460 --> 00:45:23.210
I mean it's always it's always
interesting and challenging.

00:45:23.210 --> 00:45:26.420
And now, making
one loaf of bread

00:45:26.420 --> 00:45:29.020
when you're first
starting out is

00:45:29.020 --> 00:45:33.160
new, and different, and
interesting, and challenging.

00:45:33.160 --> 00:45:34.640
And after you do
that for a while,

00:45:34.640 --> 00:45:38.940
it starts to become
easier, right?

00:45:38.940 --> 00:45:45.880
That gets complicated when you
start making 2, 4, 300 a day.

00:45:45.880 --> 00:45:48.980
And so it's still
really challenging.

00:45:48.980 --> 00:45:51.980
Like every day I have at the
bakery I'm like, holy crap.

00:45:51.980 --> 00:45:53.820
This is hard.

00:45:53.820 --> 00:45:55.980
This is hard to make
this much, and to have

00:45:55.980 --> 00:45:59.030
everything go really well.

00:45:59.030 --> 00:46:04.970
And then when the bread comes
out, the moment of truth.

00:46:04.970 --> 00:46:07.460
You see how good a job you did.

00:46:07.460 --> 00:46:12.290
And it is really
hard for the bread

00:46:12.290 --> 00:46:16.290
to live up to this
idea I have of it.

00:46:16.290 --> 00:46:19.330
And every once in
awhile, it does it.

00:46:19.330 --> 00:46:23.340
And that is like
this carrot that

00:46:23.340 --> 00:46:29.050
keeps dangling in front
of me, and keeps me--

00:46:29.050 --> 00:46:33.850
the fact that it's elusive is
very intriguing, and seductive.

00:46:36.865 --> 00:46:40.390
But that's my experience of it.

00:46:40.390 --> 00:46:42.790
Now, our customers
experience of it

00:46:42.790 --> 00:46:46.540
is that basically the
bread's the same every day.

00:46:46.540 --> 00:46:48.195
And that's awesome.

00:46:48.195 --> 00:46:50.320
The fact that we have people
coming back and buying

00:46:50.320 --> 00:46:53.070
the bread regularly is
extremely flattering,

00:46:53.070 --> 00:46:57.230
and I'm really grateful
that I can play that role.

00:46:57.230 --> 00:47:01.160
But so it's through
two different lenses

00:47:01.160 --> 00:47:02.630
that I have those experiences.

00:47:02.630 --> 00:47:08.330
I have the really critical
side from my maker perspective,

00:47:08.330 --> 00:47:12.550
and then I have the
really satisfied part,

00:47:12.550 --> 00:47:18.350
which is from my relationship
with my customers.

00:47:18.350 --> 00:47:22.010
So both of those things
mean I keep going.

00:47:22.010 --> 00:47:24.050
AUDIENCE: So at
some point you went

00:47:24.050 --> 00:47:28.560
from being some guy who
followed some recipes

00:47:28.560 --> 00:47:32.010
and was making some decent
bread that you kind of liked,

00:47:32.010 --> 00:47:36.270
and you kind of liked
doing it, to a point where

00:47:36.270 --> 00:47:44.560
you know sort of what the 100
variables that you can alter

00:47:44.560 --> 00:47:47.580
to affect the taste,
and the texture,

00:47:47.580 --> 00:47:50.310
and the size, and the color,
and all that of your bread.

00:47:50.310 --> 00:47:51.310
JOSEY BAKER: Yeah.

00:47:51.310 --> 00:47:55.760
AUDIENCE: I'm really interested
in how you got there.

00:47:55.760 --> 00:47:56.686
JOSEY BAKER: Uh-huh.

00:47:56.686 --> 00:47:59.970
AUDIENCE: How is it that you
made that transition from sort

00:47:59.970 --> 00:48:04.380
of somebody who just
follows recipes to a baker--

00:48:04.380 --> 00:48:05.130
JOSEY BAKER: Yeah.

00:48:05.130 --> 00:48:06.490
AUDIENCE: --right, who
really kind of knows

00:48:06.490 --> 00:48:07.239
what you're doing?

00:48:07.239 --> 00:48:08.040
JOSEY BAKER: Yeah.

00:48:08.040 --> 00:48:12.490
Well, I still don't
know what I'm doing.

00:48:12.490 --> 00:48:18.010
But no, I mean it is,
it's a process, right?

00:48:18.010 --> 00:48:24.750
So there wasn't any one moment
where like it all clicked

00:48:24.750 --> 00:48:25.320
or anything.

00:48:25.320 --> 00:48:28.100
It's still clicking,
like every time

00:48:28.100 --> 00:48:32.900
I'm in the bakery I'm
learning something new.

00:48:32.900 --> 00:48:36.060
And being able to
more delicately pull

00:48:36.060 --> 00:48:39.640
on all those strings as I
understand what exactly they're

00:48:39.640 --> 00:48:40.580
connected to.

00:48:44.568 --> 00:48:49.365
But one thing that I did
really early on-- yeah?

00:48:49.365 --> 00:48:50.990
AUDIENCE: You may be
about to say this,

00:48:50.990 --> 00:48:54.710
but I was going to ask if
there was a point at which you

00:48:54.710 --> 00:48:59.290
started doing things like
experimenting-- saying OK,

00:48:59.290 --> 00:49:05.900
let's on purpose, do
things in different ways

00:49:05.900 --> 00:49:06.870
and see what it's like.

00:49:06.870 --> 00:49:10.680
Knowing that probably n minus
1 of them will be really bad,

00:49:10.680 --> 00:49:13.251
but you'll discover which is
the one that's really good.

00:49:13.251 --> 00:49:14.000
JOSEY BAKER: Yeah.

00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:16.270
I started doing that
pretty early on.

00:49:16.270 --> 00:49:20.420
Yeah, and I was very, I
was meticulous about it.

00:49:20.420 --> 00:49:22.900
And that is in part
just my disposition,

00:49:22.900 --> 00:49:24.370
but also because
I would had just

00:49:24.370 --> 00:49:26.900
been working in science
education for the last five

00:49:26.900 --> 00:49:27.400
years.

00:49:27.400 --> 00:49:30.440
And so I knew that that was the
way I was going to get answers

00:49:30.440 --> 00:49:33.300
to my questions, and I had
really specific questions.

00:49:33.300 --> 00:49:41.780
And so I think also having
the experience of not getting

00:49:41.780 --> 00:49:44.880
it all laid out for
me by going to school

00:49:44.880 --> 00:49:48.260
or working under someone
else, that kind of had

00:49:48.260 --> 00:49:51.100
to be my approach
from the beginning.

00:49:51.100 --> 00:49:53.590
I was doing the
investigation here,

00:49:53.590 --> 00:49:56.670
and I was getting to decide
what the questions were.

00:49:56.670 --> 00:49:59.560
So I went about it in a
pretty scientific way,

00:49:59.560 --> 00:50:03.960
and having my buddy just
scribble out some instructions.

00:50:03.960 --> 00:50:09.320
And then, really quickly
noticing that everybody

00:50:09.320 --> 00:50:11.320
has a different way
of doing it, right?

00:50:11.320 --> 00:50:14.460
And obviously there's
many different ways

00:50:14.460 --> 00:50:15.710
to make a great loaf of bread.

00:50:15.710 --> 00:50:20.030
Like there's many different ways
to do most things, and so, OK.

00:50:20.030 --> 00:50:24.950
Well why does this method work?

00:50:24.950 --> 00:50:28.750
And this method works, and
they're so totally different.

00:50:28.750 --> 00:50:36.580
And so I had a lot
of energy that I

00:50:36.580 --> 00:50:40.380
was ready to pour into
something, and bread became it.

00:50:40.380 --> 00:50:51.040
And by making it my job very
quickly, all of sudden I

00:50:51.040 --> 00:50:52.144
was baking all the time.

00:50:52.144 --> 00:50:54.560
I mean, I was baking a lot
because I was interested in it.

00:50:54.560 --> 00:50:56.476
But then I started selling
it, and then people

00:50:56.476 --> 00:50:57.970
started asking me for it.

00:50:57.970 --> 00:51:00.490
And so then I was just
really, that really

00:51:00.490 --> 00:51:01.680
accelerated everything.

00:51:01.680 --> 00:51:05.820
And it was always a really
rich learning experience,

00:51:05.820 --> 00:51:07.980
because there wasn't
anybody saying, hey,

00:51:07.980 --> 00:51:10.810
you need to make sure
that water is 75 degrees.

00:51:10.810 --> 00:51:11.470
Well, why?

00:51:14.060 --> 00:51:16.750
Well what happens if
I make it 80 degrees?

00:51:16.750 --> 00:51:19.360
And by the way, I
didn't even measure

00:51:19.360 --> 00:51:20.570
the temperature of the water.

00:51:20.570 --> 00:51:22.930
Which any of you have
baked any bread before,

00:51:22.930 --> 00:51:25.870
you know that the
temperature of the water

00:51:25.870 --> 00:51:29.390
will really affect how
quickly your bread ferments.

00:51:29.390 --> 00:51:30.660
The temperature of your dough.

00:51:30.660 --> 00:51:32.140
Basically a warmer
dough ferments

00:51:32.140 --> 00:51:33.780
quicker than a cooler dough.

00:51:33.780 --> 00:51:34.750
Simple rule of thumb.

00:51:34.750 --> 00:51:36.760
But I didn't even
take the temperature

00:51:36.760 --> 00:51:40.050
of the water for the first
like, six or eight months

00:51:40.050 --> 00:51:42.050
that I baked at Mission Pie.

00:51:42.050 --> 00:51:44.500
And it was fine.

00:51:44.500 --> 00:51:46.890
So if you're nervous about
taking the temperature,

00:51:46.890 --> 00:51:47.820
just don't do it.

00:51:50.750 --> 00:51:53.504
Does that kind of answer-- yeah.

00:51:53.504 --> 00:51:55.420
AUDIENCE: I'm kind of
curious about just like,

00:51:55.420 --> 00:51:56.950
you mentioned the
community aspect.

00:51:56.950 --> 00:51:58.658
And I think we're
super fortunate to live

00:51:58.658 --> 00:52:00.570
in San Fransisco
where we have access

00:52:00.570 --> 00:52:02.576
to wonderful talents like you.

00:52:02.576 --> 00:52:03.700
JOSEY BAKER: Oh, thank you.

00:52:03.700 --> 00:52:05.640
AUDIENCE: Just as
far as continuing

00:52:05.640 --> 00:52:07.420
this, where you have
a community of people

00:52:07.420 --> 00:52:10.080
who have amazing talents
when it comes to food.

00:52:10.080 --> 00:52:12.850
Is there something that
you're a part of outside

00:52:12.850 --> 00:52:15.450
of, now that you've
got this establishment,

00:52:15.450 --> 00:52:16.630
your huge business.

00:52:16.630 --> 00:52:18.940
You're growing, like
are there other things?

00:52:18.940 --> 00:52:20.960
Like do you see sort of
a connection or a larger

00:52:20.960 --> 00:52:22.655
community that's
becoming bigger hear

00:52:22.655 --> 00:52:26.060
in San Fransisco than other
cities where we can support?

00:52:26.060 --> 00:52:28.180
I mean I've love
seeing this, and I

00:52:28.180 --> 00:52:30.610
love seeing it happen here
in San Fransisco rather

00:52:30.610 --> 00:52:31.360
than other cities.

00:52:31.360 --> 00:52:32.750
I'm just curious of
whether or not there's--

00:52:32.750 --> 00:52:34.750
JOSEY BAKER: Meaning like
a formal organization?

00:52:34.750 --> 00:52:36.526
Or just--

00:52:36.526 --> 00:52:41.570
AUDIENCE: Like a collective of
artisanal baker's and others.

00:52:41.570 --> 00:52:44.010
JOSEY BAKER: Yeah,
that's a great question.

00:52:44.010 --> 00:52:51.444
I think, I'm not a member
of any formal organization

00:52:51.444 --> 00:52:56.100
that's catered
specifically to that.

00:52:56.100 --> 00:52:56.925
What I find--

00:52:58.814 --> 00:53:00.230
AUDIENCE: Part of
the reason why I

00:53:00.230 --> 00:53:02.520
ask is because it's
fascinating as you look

00:53:02.520 --> 00:53:03.900
at how you established yourself.

00:53:03.900 --> 00:53:04.649
JOSEY BAKER: Yeah.

00:53:04.649 --> 00:53:06.920
AUDIENCE: And I'm sure it
was very scary at times

00:53:06.920 --> 00:53:07.630
and challenging.

00:53:07.630 --> 00:53:09.202
And so who did you turn to?

00:53:09.202 --> 00:53:10.035
JOSEY BAKER: Gotcha.

00:53:10.035 --> 00:53:11.868
AUDIENCE: There's people
who in similar ways

00:53:11.868 --> 00:53:13.880
just establishing
themselves, and how do you

00:53:13.880 --> 00:53:15.856
guys support each other?

00:53:15.856 --> 00:53:17.230
JOSEY BAKER: So
one of the things

00:53:17.230 --> 00:53:19.850
that was so helpful to me
from the very beginning

00:53:19.850 --> 00:53:24.000
was that I was able to,
again, I would never

00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:27.470
use this term in the moment, but
I was able to find mentors who

00:53:27.470 --> 00:53:31.290
were people who were already
working in the industry who had

00:53:31.290 --> 00:53:33.560
answers all these
questions I had.

00:53:33.560 --> 00:53:37.560
And there are
certain organizations

00:53:37.560 --> 00:53:43.010
that have that type
of framework set up,

00:53:43.010 --> 00:53:48.750
like La Cocina in the Mission.

00:53:48.750 --> 00:53:56.400
But without that guidance,
I would've been really lost.

00:53:56.400 --> 00:54:01.500
And I think I was bold
enough or stupid enough

00:54:01.500 --> 00:54:03.940
to just really
talk to anybody who

00:54:03.940 --> 00:54:05.420
would talk about it with me.

00:54:05.420 --> 00:54:08.030
And every once in a while
you can find someone

00:54:08.030 --> 00:54:10.730
who you resonate with,
and who you can actually

00:54:10.730 --> 00:54:17.480
have a relationship with like
Charlie Hallowell, and Jody

00:54:17.480 --> 00:54:20.780
and Jeremy from Four Barrel,
and the owners of Mission Pie,

00:54:20.780 --> 00:54:22.050
and Dave Miller out in Chico.

00:54:22.050 --> 00:54:26.030
Like all those people
were so helpful in helping

00:54:26.030 --> 00:54:29.570
me figure out what
my value system was,

00:54:29.570 --> 00:54:33.860
and how to navigate
that whole thing.

00:54:33.860 --> 00:54:37.290
So I don't have a great
answer though for you

00:54:37.290 --> 00:54:43.669
as far as what, maybe someone
in the room knows about some--

00:54:43.669 --> 00:54:45.210
AUDIENCE: Maybe you
should start one.

00:54:45.210 --> 00:54:47.300
JOSEY BAKER: Maybe
I should start one.

00:54:47.300 --> 00:54:49.008
AUDIENCE: I think you
have a great story,

00:54:49.008 --> 00:54:50.425
so I'd just like,
spread the word.

00:54:50.425 --> 00:54:51.716
JOSEY BAKER: I appreciate that.

00:54:51.716 --> 00:54:53.930
It's one of the things
that I've been chewing on.

00:54:53.930 --> 00:54:56.530
I'm trying right now to
not start any new projects,

00:54:56.530 --> 00:55:01.230
but something along those lines
is something I've considered,

00:55:01.230 --> 00:55:03.809
so thank you.

00:55:03.809 --> 00:55:04.350
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:55:04.350 --> 00:55:06.680
So I live near The Mill
in Western Edition.

00:55:06.680 --> 00:55:09.380
And I every time I walk by
it's just so busy, so crowded.

00:55:09.380 --> 00:55:12.230
Do you have any plans
of other locations?

00:55:12.230 --> 00:55:14.580
Or when you look to the
future what do you see,

00:55:14.580 --> 00:55:17.240
or what are your plans?

00:55:17.240 --> 00:55:19.650
JOSEY BAKER: I don't want
to open another location

00:55:19.650 --> 00:55:27.510
any time soon, mostly because
it was so much work to get it up

00:55:27.510 --> 00:55:28.470
and running.

00:55:28.470 --> 00:55:31.850
And now it's up
and running, and I

00:55:31.850 --> 00:55:34.785
want to be in that for a while.

00:55:37.880 --> 00:55:40.350
And if I was to
start something else,

00:55:40.350 --> 00:55:43.190
I would just be in the
process of building again.

00:55:43.190 --> 00:55:45.980
So no, I think what
we're going to focus on

00:55:45.980 --> 00:55:51.810
for a while at least is
exploring different breads,

00:55:51.810 --> 00:55:54.160
exploring work with
different grains,

00:55:54.160 --> 00:55:59.820
building relationships
with California farmers.

00:55:59.820 --> 00:56:10.330
That stuff is really, those are
the goals of building The Mill.

00:56:10.330 --> 00:56:14.040
And now that we have it, we can
get to work on those things.

00:56:17.120 --> 00:56:21.892
Is the idea of
opening a restaurant

00:56:21.892 --> 00:56:23.850
where we serve toast and
coffee in the morning,

00:56:23.850 --> 00:56:27.480
and pizza, beer at night,
is that exciting to me?

00:56:27.480 --> 00:56:29.290
Hell yeah.

00:56:29.290 --> 00:56:32.310
Will I maybe do
that at some point?

00:56:32.310 --> 00:56:36.340
Very possibly, but not yet.

00:56:36.340 --> 00:56:38.180
I'm going to start
work on another book

00:56:38.180 --> 00:56:44.610
though which is going to be a
journey to my favorite bakers

00:56:44.610 --> 00:56:48.460
around the country,
and exploring

00:56:48.460 --> 00:56:51.040
the role of the
village baker today.

00:56:51.040 --> 00:56:58.410
And translating their recipes
into recipes for the home cook.

00:56:58.410 --> 00:57:00.130
It's just an excuse
to get to go hang out

00:57:00.130 --> 00:57:03.860
with my favorite bakers.

00:57:03.860 --> 00:57:08.910
AUDIENCE: So you described a
really interesting and somewhat

00:57:08.910 --> 00:57:14.610
unique and idiosyncratic
path to how you got here.

00:57:14.610 --> 00:57:18.480
I'm wondering how that affects
the way that you teach,

00:57:18.480 --> 00:57:22.547
and mentor, and relate to the
people who work for you, right?

00:57:22.547 --> 00:57:24.380
Because they're coming
into this thing which

00:57:24.380 --> 00:57:26.970
now is kind of
established, but you

00:57:26.970 --> 00:57:29.810
came into it sort
of from scratch

00:57:29.810 --> 00:57:31.550
and having to learn
it all yourself.

00:57:31.550 --> 00:57:34.530
So I'm wondering if that
affects the way that you

00:57:34.530 --> 00:57:36.790
interact with them, and
teach, and mentor them.

00:57:36.790 --> 00:57:37.760
JOSEY BAKER: Yeah.

00:57:37.760 --> 00:57:43.010
We've had a growing team
of folks at the bakery.

00:57:43.010 --> 00:57:48.150
Now we're up to 10 people,
and that's a great size.

00:57:48.150 --> 00:57:52.240
And I can have a direct
relationship with everybody

00:57:52.240 --> 00:57:53.630
that works for me.

00:57:53.630 --> 00:57:57.660
And for now, that's what I want.

00:57:57.660 --> 00:58:01.851
I don't-- I actively am not
looking to have the team grow

00:58:01.851 --> 00:58:02.350
at all.

00:58:05.320 --> 00:58:09.420
But I like that because of
that direct relationship

00:58:09.420 --> 00:58:15.040
I get to have with everybody
who works for me, what I wanted

00:58:15.040 --> 00:58:19.370
to build at The Mill was
really like a tight knit

00:58:19.370 --> 00:58:20.510
little family.

00:58:20.510 --> 00:58:23.060
A crew of people.

00:58:23.060 --> 00:58:27.640
And to a large
extent we've done it.

00:58:27.640 --> 00:58:31.450
We all spend a lot of
our free time together.

00:58:31.450 --> 00:58:33.850
We like it and
respect each other

00:58:33.850 --> 00:58:35.950
as coworkers and as people.

00:58:39.690 --> 00:58:48.580
But it's interesting, because
I haven't hired anybody

00:58:48.580 --> 00:58:52.820
as a baker who didn't
have any experience.

00:58:55.690 --> 00:58:57.960
A few of the folks
had more experience

00:58:57.960 --> 00:58:59.880
working in bakeries than I did.

00:58:59.880 --> 00:59:04.030
Which wasn't too hard
because I didn't have much,

00:59:04.030 --> 00:59:09.630
but we've had people join
the team who really didn't

00:59:09.630 --> 00:59:13.400
have much experience in baking.

00:59:13.400 --> 00:59:16.150
But they were really,
really interested,

00:59:16.150 --> 00:59:20.400
and they were really
dedicated to it.

00:59:20.400 --> 00:59:27.890
And they didn't already have
all of these ideas about how

00:59:27.890 --> 00:59:29.590
we were going to
go about things.

00:59:29.590 --> 00:59:30.100
Right?

00:59:30.100 --> 00:59:34.130
And so we're able to start
and build from the ground up,

00:59:34.130 --> 00:59:37.880
and sometimes
that's a lot easier

00:59:37.880 --> 00:59:40.697
than having to unlearn
things that you've learned

00:59:40.697 --> 00:59:42.280
from however long
you've been doing it

00:59:42.280 --> 00:59:43.488
the way you've been doing it.

00:59:46.340 --> 00:59:51.190
I, as much as possible,
try to remain really open

00:59:51.190 --> 00:59:54.370
with all of my employees.

00:59:54.370 --> 01:00:00.080
And I always say, I
say the best idea wins.

01:00:00.080 --> 01:00:04.090
Which means if it's somebody's
first day and they come in,

01:00:04.090 --> 01:00:08.200
and they don't know the way
we're used to doing things

01:00:08.200 --> 01:00:11.760
and they ask a question or
they suggest doing something

01:00:11.760 --> 01:00:15.300
radically different, if
you keep your mind open,

01:00:15.300 --> 01:00:17.960
they might have a
brilliant solution

01:00:17.960 --> 01:00:20.130
to a problem you didn't
even know you had.

01:00:20.130 --> 01:00:24.280
And so sometimes that
happens, and sometimes it's

01:00:24.280 --> 01:00:25.140
a stupid idea.

01:00:25.140 --> 01:00:32.020
But you've got to keep
your eyes open to it.

01:00:32.020 --> 01:00:35.130
Thank you so much for coming,
I really appreciate it.
