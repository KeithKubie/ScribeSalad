00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:30.260
The ghosts in Pac-Man are among some of the
most enduring enemies in video game history,

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:34.500
thanks in part to their surprisingly difficult
to predict movements which make the game a

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.640
constant challenge for new and seasoned players
alike.

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:42.540
However, as it turns out, the ghost’s movements
are defined by a deceptively simple set of

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.500
algorithms thought up by the game’s designer,
Toru Iwatani.

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.440
According to Iwatani, all of the ghosts in
Pac-Man have their own distinct personality

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.800
which influences the movements they make.

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.180
This was a deliberate choice Iwatani made
very early on in the game’s development

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:00.630
so that, as he said, “they weren’t all
just chasing after Pac-Man in single file,

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:02.670
which would have been tiresome and flat.”

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.390
In fact, only one of the ghosts in Pac-Man
actually directly chases the titular hero,

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:12.080
Blinky (the red ghost), while the rest have
movements that don’t go directly for Pac-Man,

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.920
but are influenced by Pac-Man’s current
position on the screen.

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.170
You see, the Pac-Man game-board is normally
separated into a grid consisting of multiple

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.880
8 pixel by 8 pixel squares, known as tiles,
with the tile Pac-Man currently resides in

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.320
generally being the thing used by the ghosts
to determine which direction they will go

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.780
after they transition to a new tile.

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.289
In regards to Blinky, along with being the
only ghost to actively pursue Pac-Man directly

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:40.950
in-game, he’s also the only ghost not to
begin each round inside the small holding

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.720
pen in the middle of the screen (known by
fans as “the ghost house”).

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.450
Put simply, Blinky is programmed to target
whichever tile Pac-Man currently occupies,

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.679
giving the illusion that he’s chasing the
player.

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:56.179
As the game progresses, Blinky’s speed increases
to the point that he becomes marginally faster

00:01:56.179 --> 00:02:01.130
than Pac-Man at which point he becomes what
fans refer to as “Cruise Elroy”.

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.280
The exact number of dots you need to consume
for Blinky to become Cruise Elroy depends

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.050
on which level you’re currently playing,
with the overall number dropping the further

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:13.099
you get into the game to the point that he
will assume Cruise Elroy form when there are

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:14.640
still 60 dots left on screen.

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.500
Blinky will momentarily cease being Cruise
Elroy whenever the player loses a life.

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.720
As for where the name Cruise Elroy comes from,
despite being ingrained as part of Pac-Man

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.440
lore, nobody seems to know.

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.240
In the original arcade game, Blinky’s official
name is “Shadow” alluding to the fact

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:32.140
that he is almost always right behind the
player.

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:35.629
In the Japanese version, his personality is
described as “oikake” which roughly translates

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:36.930
to “chaser“.

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:42.230
The Pink ghost, known as Pinky, is programmed
to try and land on the space 16 pixels (or

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:45.170
two tiles in front) of Pac-Man to ambush him.

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:49.739
However, due to “overflow error” in the
game’s code, if Pac-Man is facing upwards,

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:53.939
Pinky will instead attempted to land on the
space 4 tiles in front of him and 4 tiles

00:02:53.939 --> 00:02:55.000
to the left.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.099
Interestingly, because Pinky is programmed
to always be ahead of Pac-Man, you can usually

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:02.430
make her stop chasing you by heading straight
for her.

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.269
In the English arcade version of the game,
Pinky is known as “Speedy” which many

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:11.000
believe is a mistake, since Blinky is the
only ghost who can travel faster than the

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.000
player.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.609
However, in the game Super Smash Bros, this
apparent misnomer is clarified as follows:

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:18.340
“A pink ghost that strategically targets
Pac-Man in the Pac-Man series.

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:23.000
She’s also known as Speedy, as she can anticipate
Pac-Man’s moves and get ahead of him quick

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.430
enough to ambush him.”

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.750
In the Japanese version of the game, Pinky’s
personality is described as “machibuse”

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:29.640
which fittingly translates to “ambusher“.

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.690
The blue ghost, known as Inky, has what has
been described as one of the more difficult

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:36.830
ghosts to avoid for seasoned players, because
his movements appear more erratic than the

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:37.830
others.

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:41.499
You see, Inky’s movements are determined
by both the relative position of Pac-Man and

00:03:41.499 --> 00:03:42.499
Blinky.

00:03:42.499 --> 00:03:45.939
In a nutshell, Inky will try to move to a
tile that is calculated by taking the tile

00:03:45.939 --> 00:03:50.530
two spaces ahead of Pac-Man and doubling the
distance Blinky is away from it.

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:55.719
Similar to Pinky, if Pac-Man is facing upwards,
this tile will be two tiles ahead of Pac-Man

00:03:55.719 --> 00:03:57.470
and two tiles to the left.

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:01.620
Because of this comparatively complex targeting
method, Inky’s movement’s fluctuate a

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.780
bit, making his English name “Bashful”
rather appropriate.

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:06.599
In the Japanese version, Inky’s personality
is described as “kimagure” which roughly

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:10.389
translates to “Fickle” as a nod to his
indecisive movements.

00:04:10.389 --> 00:04:14.299
As for the final, orange ghost, known as Clyde,
his movements are based on how far away he

00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:15.609
currently is from Pac-Man.

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:19.519
Whenever Clyde is more than 8 tiles away from
Pac-Man, his movements are identical to that

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:23.990
of Blinky’s, in that he will actively attempt
to move towards whichever tile Pac-Man is

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.990
currently occupying.

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:29.810
However, as soon as Clyde comes within 8 tiles
of the circular hero, he will attempt to flee

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:33.130
to the bottom left portion of the screen and
hide there.

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:37.090
In the English version of the game, Clyde
is described as “Pokey”, alluding to his

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:38.480
seeming stupidity.

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:40.590
In the Japanese version, Clyde comes out a
little better, with his personality being

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:42.120
listed as “otoboke” or “feigning ignorance“.

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:45.740
Along with this, the ghosts also have three
possible modes that they can be in at any

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:49.740
one time, Chase Mode, Scatter Mode and Frightened
Mode.

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:53.560
In chase mode, the ghosts will move exactly
as previously described.

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:57.050
After a few seconds of gameplay (with the
exact amount varying depending on the current

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:01.300
level), the ghosts will enter what is known
as Scatter Mode, where they will all flee

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:05.620
to a different corner of the map, with Blinky
heading for the top right, Pinky heading for

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:10.740
the top left, Inky heading for the bottom
right and Clyde heading for the bottom left.

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:15.300
During Scatter Mode, each ghost’s individual
target tile is placed just outside of their

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:19.389
respective favourite corner, causing them
to endlessly move in circles.

00:05:19.389 --> 00:05:24.080
The ghosts can only enter Scatter Mode a maximum
of 4 times in a given life or level, at which

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:26.780
point they’ll enter Chase Mode indefinitely.

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:31.490
As for Frightened Mode, this occurs whenever
Pac-Man eats a Power Pellet and is characterised

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:36.650
by all of the ghosts turning blue and running
away, at which point Pac-Man can eat them.

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:40.460
Upon entering Frightened Mode, all of the
ghosts will immediately reverse direction

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:45.080
and upon reaching a corner, a “psuedo-random
number generator” will decide the direction

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:46.379
they turn at that point.

00:05:46.379 --> 00:05:50.380
After Frightened Mode ends, the ghosts will
continue with whatever they were doing before.

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:55.090
Annoyingly, after moving past level 20, Power
Pellets will no longer cause ghosts to become

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:56.090
blue.

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:59.680
All of these factors combine to make the four
ghosts incredibly difficult to avoid for newer

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:04.030
players at higher levels, meaning the game
provides a continuous challenge for all but

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:09.910
the most skilled aficionados, who can abuse
the ghost’s rudimentary AI to move unimpeded

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:10.930
around the maps.

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:15.530
The master of this sort of thing is Billy
L. Mitchell, who is often hailed as the greatest

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:19.970
arcade game player of all time- among many
other arcade game records being the first

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:26.110
to achieve a perfect Pac-Man score of 3,333,360,
doing so on July 3, 1999.

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:27.220
How does one achieve that score?

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:32.659
Simply by managing to eat every dot, bonus,
energizer, and ghost on every single level

00:06:32.659 --> 00:06:39.949
(255 full levels, with a 256th that can’t
be completed due to a bug in the game) without

00:06:39.949 --> 00:06:52.740
ever 

00:06:52.740 --> 00:08:59.500
having 

00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:22.900
Pac-Man die.
