00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.630
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:25.730 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Paul Fraunfelter: Good afternoon.

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:28.310
I'm Paul Fraunfelter
with the Music Division.

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:34.000
And I call this presentation, World
War One Sheet Music at the Library

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.870 position:56%
of Congress, America's War as
Viewed by Publishers and the Public.

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:44.300
So, 100 years ago today,
Congress was

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.520
across the street debating
President Wilson's war resolution.

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:52.600
And very soon, songs like the
hit, "I Didn't Raise My Boy

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.670 position:56%
to Be a Soldier," and the
"Neutrality Rag," would no longer be

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.770
in the national interest.

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.420
During the period of
neutrality, anger at Germany

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.540
and sympathy towards France and
Britain, had steadily increased.

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:12.010
Yet, when the War Declaration came,
there was little public interest

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:14.530
or enthusiasm to actively join

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:18.400
in with what was then
called the European War.

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:22.290
In order to gain support
for the war effort

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.420
and help spread the
national message,

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.970
President Wilson established the
Committee on Public Information.

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:34.750
The CPI was the official
government propaganda instrument.

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:39.980
And very quickly, their
activities became widespread

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:43.190
and pervasive in American life.

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:50.680
Only around for two years, CPI
quickly expanded from propaganda.

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.820
Got into censorship.

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:57.420
Attempted to control all war
news that reached the public.

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.790
And even engaged in public
attacks on groups or individuals

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:08.160
that it felt were less
than 100% American.

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:13.490
Today, the CPI is usually
remembered for two things.

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:17.830
The posters it commissioned
and the work of its film unit.

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:22.940 position:56%
The picture you see up here, the
image, is -- that covers both basis.

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:28.860
This is a poster about
one of their movies there,

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.340
one of their two feature
films that they had.

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.540
It's also an example of what
you can find in the prints

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.350
and photographs division,
online World War One posters.

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:41.720
There's a lot of cool stuff there.

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.160
I love going there.

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.790
But for the ability to
reach a mass audience,

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.590
in a time before mass
communications,

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:55.820
probably their most effective
initiative was the Speaker series.

00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:04.760 position:56%
CPI sponsored programs that featured
patriotic, often inflammatory

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:09.570
or incendiary speeches,
given by Four Minute Men.

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:12.230
So called for the length
of these addresses.

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:18.970
And this really was a
saturation campaign.

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:24.530
These meetings kind of took
like a town hall sort of format.

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:27.810
Any place they could get
a room, you know, schools,

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.490
churches, maybe libraries.

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:34.440
Every village, every town,
any place they could get in.

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.350
By the end of the war, over 750,000

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:40.930
of these speeches had
been given nationwide.

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:43.880
The programs also finished --

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:47.540
finished, well, maybe they
finished with it, maybe not.

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:52.080
But they also included
patriotic group singing.

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.860
Similarly called Four
Minute Singing.

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:58.220 position:56%
And this is also another CPI poster.

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:01.850
And note the blank
space at the bottom,

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:04.910
where local printers
could put venue and date

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:10.800
and time information
for upcoming shows.

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:17.310
So, with the war, now foremost in
the public's mind, the songwriters

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:21.600
of New York Cities, Tin Pan Alley,
the music publishing district,

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:25.450
now began producing work
reflective of the new reality.

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:29.780
In 1917, the Vaudeville
Variety Stage,

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:33.840
was the nation's chief source
of public entertainment.

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.580
And the cinema, of
course, was still silent.

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:40.260 position:56%
It had not overtaken Vaudeville yet.

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:46.540 position:56%
Recording was important, but at that
time, considered a secondary market.

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:51.710
And of course, broadcast radio
was several years in the future.

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:57.340
The publishers promoted their
songs to the Vaudeville performers

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:01.610
or their agents, to get
them to perform the songs.

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:04.620
Present them to the public
on the Vaudeville circuit.

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:09.030
Hopefully make hits, which would
drive demand for the sheet music.

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:13.230
Sheet music sales was the
publishers chief source

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:14.780
of income, at that time.

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:20.040
And this was still, you know,
very much the era of the piano

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:23.330
in the parlor and making
your own music at home.

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:31.240
In 2013, the music division,
catalogued and scanned

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:36.680
about 14,000 pieces of World
War One classified sheet music.

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:40.500
As you can see in the breakdown,
about 80% of it's printed.

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:43.220
About 20% of it is manuscript.

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:49.470
From the printed, there's a 60, 40
split between for profit commercial

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:54.270
and self-published and
amateur vanity press.

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:57.570
The manuscripts are essentially
all copyright deposits.

00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:01.130
But within that, it's
kind of a mix bag

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:03.850
of what they may have
been when they came in.

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:08.010
There are pieces that
are obviously the work

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:12.280
of an experienced musician
or a copyist.

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:16.440
There's some really rough stuff
that's obviously amateur work.

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:19.830
And there's even more
gray area in-between.

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:24.410
Where it's hard to determine
where that may have come from.

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:26.200
There's also a good chunk

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:29.890
of non-print manuscript
vanity press pieces.

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:34.430
But I'd say probably
about 35 to 40% of it.

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:38.190
We have well over 1,2000
pieces in there.

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:43.190
And there are also manuscript
drafts that were sent

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:48.140
in for copyright deposit, prior
to subsequent publication.

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:52.860
If you dig around in the website
long enough and you look around,

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:56.290
you'll realize that
there are many songs

00:06:56.290 --> 00:07:00.710
that we have both the
copyright deposit manuscript

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:03.760
and the first printed edition.

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:10.590
So, overall, what we have in
the collection, is a collection

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:14.630
that was created by
publishers and the public.

00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:19.820
I want to talk a little
bit about the Vanity Press.

00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:23.470
The column that you see here,

00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:29.740
is a detail from the sheet
music websites display list.

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:34.070
And the top nine entries,
the most prolific producers

00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:36.320
of World War One songs,

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:42.090
are all either Vanity Press
song writers or publishers.

00:07:42.090 --> 00:07:45.880
There's a little intersection
in the numbers here.

00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:49.060
You see Leo Friedman and North
American Music are very close.

00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:54.510
Well, Leo Friedman was associated
with North American Music.

00:07:54.510 --> 00:08:00.660
Similarly, Hector Richard here,
was associated with Legters.

00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:05.790
Also, not all these song
writers worked exclusively

00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:07.500
for the Vanity Press.

00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:10.350
Or at least some point
of the careers,

00:08:10.350 --> 00:08:13.400
they did freelance or outside work.

00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:15.710
Leo Friedman had a hit.

00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:19.150
He wrote the music for "Let
Me Call You Sweetheart."

00:08:19.150 --> 00:08:21.970
And George Graff, down
here, wrote the music

00:08:21.970 --> 00:08:25.110
for "When Irish Eyes are Smiling."

00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:32.340
The basic agreement was
that someone with a poem,

00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:35.730
usually an original poem,
that they wanted set

00:08:35.730 --> 00:08:38.250
to music, to make a song of.

00:08:38.250 --> 00:08:43.440
Would contact a Vanity Press and
pay them to have their song writer

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:47.980
or pulper, as they were known,
to set the song to music.

00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:53.390
And the Vanity Press would
take care of copyright deposit.

00:08:53.390 --> 00:08:56.920
Beyond that, there are two
different business models found

00:08:56.920 --> 00:08:58.380
in the collection.

00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:03.830
The first is that the client
would then choose from a selection

00:09:03.830 --> 00:09:07.240
of standard cover illustrations.

00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:08.540
Here you see four.

00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:10.550
There were about 16
in the collection

00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:13.450
that you see over and over again.

00:09:13.450 --> 00:09:18.210
With just the title
and the names changed.

00:09:18.210 --> 00:09:24.180
The agreed upon issue would then
be printed out on cheap stock

00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:27.770
in a standard piano
vocal arrangement.

00:09:27.770 --> 00:09:32.040
Two versus and a chorus, is
what the client usually got.

00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:37.440
Then the whole thing was delivered
to the client, to distribute

00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:40.090
or market, if they wished.

00:09:40.090 --> 00:09:43.620
However, they wanted to do that.

00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:51.120
The other model, according to the
account of someone who had worked

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:54.660
for one of these people as a
copyist during the depression,

00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:59.060
was that the Vanity
Press sold the client

00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:02.510
on the dream of fame and fortune.

00:10:02.510 --> 00:10:06.340
By promising to promote their song

00:10:06.340 --> 00:10:10.060
to a large commercial
publishing house.

00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:12.620
You know, hopefully get it
on the Vaudeville circuit

00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:17.930
and become a hit and
fame and fortune.

00:10:17.930 --> 00:10:22.200
This is a piece by Raymond Brown.

00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:27.060
And he was the most prolific
pulper in this business model.

00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:31.120
We have over 740 of his pieces.

00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:34.640
And I find his stuff
a little unusual

00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:37.860
because he would always break
his songs down into components.

00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:42.580 position:56%
He would identify the
introduction, the verse, the chorus.

00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:46.640
And then put the client's
lyrics pasted directly

00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:49.150
onto the main script sheet.

00:10:49.150 --> 00:10:52.230
Notice that it is just the melody.

00:10:52.230 --> 00:10:54.110
There's no harmonization.

00:10:54.110 --> 00:10:56.940
There's no arrangement.

00:10:56.940 --> 00:11:01.090
This is also kind of
uncharacteristic for one

00:11:01.090 --> 00:11:03.230
of Brown's pieces because
of its length.

00:11:03.230 --> 00:11:07.600
He's got a 24-bar verse
and a 16-bar chorus.

00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:12.080
Some of his pieces in there are
as simple as a four-bar intro,

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:16.470
an eight-bar verse and
an eight-bar chorus.

00:11:16.470 --> 00:11:22.790
Other pulpers that worked in this
business model, delivered something

00:11:22.790 --> 00:11:24.900
that looked a lot like Brown's.

00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:29.550
But they would write the verse
chorus sequence out in something

00:11:29.550 --> 00:11:34.770
that closely resembles
a modern lead sheet.

00:11:34.770 --> 00:11:39.510
The finished product
was three copies.

00:11:39.510 --> 00:11:42.270
The client, of course,
would get one.

00:11:42.270 --> 00:11:48.220
The Vanity Press would keep one,
supposedly to show to publishers.

00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:51.780
And the Library of
Congress got the third.

00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:57.130
And the copyist, I mentioned
before, said in her time

00:11:57.130 --> 00:12:02.990
with the Vanity Press, she had seen
her boss attempt to sell one piece

00:12:02.990 --> 00:12:06.980
of music to a publishing house.

00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:13.190
So, now let's get to the meat
and potatoes of the collection.

00:12:13.190 --> 00:12:18.410
And look at some of the
recurring themes and subjects.

00:12:18.410 --> 00:12:20.750
Why were we at war?

00:12:20.750 --> 00:12:24.240
Well, there were a whole
lot of contributing factors.

00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:28.300
But of course, the straw that broke
the camel's back was Germanies

00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:31.250
declaration of unrestricted
submarine warfare.

00:12:31.250 --> 00:12:38.130
The U-boat songs in the collection,
typically do not depict U-boats

00:12:38.130 --> 00:12:42.410
as menaces or high seas killers.

00:12:42.410 --> 00:12:46.730
But more like nuisances, which
we'll quickly dispense of.

00:12:46.730 --> 00:12:49.390
We'll sweep them from the seas.

00:12:49.390 --> 00:12:55.450 position:56%
And in many of these songs, there is
a demeaning superior attitude shown

00:12:55.450 --> 00:12:56.750
towards the enemy.

00:12:56.750 --> 00:12:59.980
And that attitude --
that's why I put this first,

00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:04.480
carries over throughout
the collection.

00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:07.920
President Wilson's
famous declaration,

00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:11.870
"The world must be made
safe for democracy."

00:13:11.870 --> 00:13:15.660
Actually, got him some
heat in Congress

00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:20.790
for inserting ideology
into the war resolution.

00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:23.570
But it resounded with the public.

00:13:23.570 --> 00:13:29.410
There are songs about democracy,
the defense of democracy.

00:13:29.410 --> 00:13:32.280
The triumph of democracy
and the doom

00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:35.550
of the militaristic
German autocracy.

00:13:35.550 --> 00:13:39.940
And I said this resounded with
the public, as the majority

00:13:39.940 --> 00:13:43.150
of these kinds of songs all
come from the Vanity Press

00:13:43.150 --> 00:13:46.090
and the manuscripts deposits.

00:13:46.090 --> 00:13:54.250
The enemy was often characterized
or embodied in Kaiser Wilhelm.

00:13:54.250 --> 00:14:00.280
He's shown as the chief provocateur
and a villain of the war.

00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:02.140
Old Satan gets the [inaudible],

00:14:02.140 --> 00:14:07.270
as a very typically cover
treatment of Wilhelm.

00:14:07.270 --> 00:14:11.720
He's shown several times with
the devil or with other demons.

00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:14.870
But he can be chased by goats.

00:14:14.870 --> 00:14:19.250
He can be tomahawked by a
gigantic American Indian.

00:14:19.250 --> 00:14:24.650
He can be thrown in a prison van by
a laughing John Bull and Uncle Sam.

00:14:24.650 --> 00:14:28.480
And those variations go on.

00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:32.940
The Bleeding Belgium Campaign,
was an appeal of sympathy

00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:39.370
that brought Britain its first
wave of volunteers in 1914.

00:14:39.370 --> 00:14:47.960 position:56%
And though there a few Belgium songs
in the collection, prior to 1917,

00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:53.150
the amount of songs about German
atrocities in Belgium that appear

00:14:53.150 --> 00:14:57.540
in 1917, suggests that
when we entered the war,

00:14:57.540 --> 00:15:01.590
we too took up the
Bleeding Belgium campaign.

00:15:01.590 --> 00:15:07.830
If there's one thing the common
person, just about everybody knows

00:15:07.830 --> 00:15:12.480
about World War One in
America, is that the invocation

00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:16.380
of the Great Revolutionary War
hero, the Marquis de Lafayette,

00:15:16.380 --> 00:15:22.570
was a powerful, popular,
emotional appeal at that time.

00:15:22.570 --> 00:15:27.260
And there are, indeed,
songs reminding the listener

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:32.210 position:56%
that it was now Lafayette's homeland
that was facing its dark hour.

00:15:32.210 --> 00:15:34.960
And we had an old debt to repay.

00:15:39.690 --> 00:15:46.550
When we entered the war,
literally, we did not have a plan.

00:15:46.550 --> 00:15:51.260
Certainly, we knew that our money
and our Navy would be involved.

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:56.660
But as to if we were going to
commit troops and what level

00:15:56.660 --> 00:15:59.150
of that commitment would
be, was still unknown.

00:15:59.150 --> 00:16:06.050
And certainly, no one in
Washington here, in April,1917,

00:16:06.050 --> 00:16:12.920 position:56%
thought we were going to send troops
to Europe and rescue the allies.

00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:17.000
However, there's always a however.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:21.460
The day after war was
declared, George M. Cohan,

00:16:21.460 --> 00:16:23.980 position:56%
who was already a popular songwriter

00:16:23.980 --> 00:16:27.690
and Broadway producer,
wrote, "Over There."

00:16:27.690 --> 00:16:31.820
And three weeks later,
when he presented it

00:16:31.820 --> 00:16:34.730
to the public, it was
an instant hit.

00:16:34.730 --> 00:16:37.910
And was one of the driving forces

00:16:37.910 --> 00:16:43.440
of creating the idea
of the Grand Crusade.

00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:47.240
In 1909, the U.S. became
the world's largest economy.

00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:49.680
In 1914, a lending nation.

00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:57.280 position:56%
And entering the war, solidified
America's position as a world power.

00:16:57.280 --> 00:17:05.100
Cover illustrations of songs about
the alliance, often relay a message

00:17:05.100 --> 00:17:10.230
of equality with the traditional
powers, France and Britain.

00:17:10.230 --> 00:17:12.820
Usually you see the
three flags together.

00:17:12.820 --> 00:17:15.880
The U.S. flag is always
front and center.

00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:19.480
Sometimes you'll see
Pershing and his counterparts

00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:23.240 position:56%
or even Wilson and his counterparts.

00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:29.990
This is also the first time we sent
large numbers of troops overseas.

00:17:29.990 --> 00:17:34.460
And there's a body of mostly
self-deprecating songs

00:17:34.460 --> 00:17:39.100
about young American's
experiences with French culture

00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:42.520
and French language
and French women.

00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:46.430
The most enduring of these
songs, actually comes

00:17:46.430 --> 00:17:48.180
from the post-war period.

00:17:48.180 --> 00:17:49.980
And the name of that song is?

00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:52.490
[ Inaudible Answers ]

00:17:52.490 --> 00:17:55.910
"How Ya Gonna Keep'em Down on The
Farm, After They've Seen Paree?"

00:17:55.910 --> 00:17:59.560
Exactly. But we did
not come empty handed.

00:17:59.560 --> 00:18:04.130
We brought with us, arguably,
the greatest cultural export

00:18:04.130 --> 00:18:08.000
of the twentieth century and jazz.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:14.790
And there are, indeed, early
jazz songs in the collection.

00:18:14.790 --> 00:18:22.030
And for those inclined to want to
go looking for them, I think I need

00:18:22.030 --> 00:18:25.480
to offer some sort
of kind of a caveat.

00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:31.500
You know, today, we have
well, clearly defined genres.

00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:34.070
Back then, not so much.

00:18:34.070 --> 00:18:36.980
And when you're working
in a collection

00:18:36.980 --> 00:18:42.900
and you see the terms
ragtime, blues and jazz,

00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:48.660
keep in mind that they used those
terms pretty interchangeably.

00:18:48.660 --> 00:18:51.630
There are also songs about jazz.

00:18:51.630 --> 00:18:54.810
And these normally
follow a narrative

00:18:54.810 --> 00:18:57.970
of the young Americans
on their way in Europe.

00:18:57.970 --> 00:19:02.030
And they're eagerly anticipating
what the European reception

00:19:02.030 --> 00:19:06.320
to jazz is going to be.

00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:12.860
The mantra or motto of the
day, was 100% American.

00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:17.920
And that came, not from the
CPI, but from a still active

00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:21.310
and very vocal former
President Theodore Roosevelt,

00:19:21.310 --> 00:19:23.830
during the run up to the war.

00:19:23.830 --> 00:19:29.040
Songs of general appeal, have names
like, "We're All Comrades Now."

00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:31.080
"We're All True Americans."

00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:33.460
"We're All in the Same Boat Now."

00:19:33.460 --> 00:19:37.540 position:56%
And "There's no Hyphen in My Heart."

00:19:39.620 --> 00:19:44.140
There are songs by,
about or directed to,

00:19:44.140 --> 00:19:48.130
most every ethnic group present
in the country, at the time.

00:19:48.130 --> 00:19:52.930
But the numbers favor
three groups in particular.

00:19:52.930 --> 00:19:58.310
For African Americans, this
was a time of flux and change.

00:19:58.310 --> 00:20:00.820
The Great Migration
from the rural south

00:20:00.820 --> 00:20:03.850
to the industrial north,
was underway.

00:20:03.850 --> 00:20:06.330
The NAACP had been founded.

00:20:06.330 --> 00:20:11.030
And the Modern Civil Rights
Movement, is rooted in as time.

00:20:11.030 --> 00:20:15.360
African American song writers
were active in Tin Pan Alley.

00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:19.790
African Americans, of course,
were the driving force in jazz.

00:20:19.790 --> 00:20:26.890
African Americans now had influence
in mainstream American culture.

00:20:26.890 --> 00:20:29.500
Irish Americans, then, as now,

00:20:29.500 --> 00:20:33.030
were one of the two largest ethnic
groups present in the country.

00:20:33.030 --> 00:20:36.770
And historically, their
participation

00:20:36.770 --> 00:20:40.370
in the American military
has been critical.

00:20:40.370 --> 00:20:44.170
But at that time, there
was unrest in Ireland.

00:20:44.170 --> 00:20:47.450
And a degree of anti-British
sentiment

00:20:47.450 --> 00:20:52.470
in the Irish American communities
here, that had to be addressed.

00:20:52.470 --> 00:20:55.830
Italian Americans were
the newcomers.

00:20:55.830 --> 00:21:01.570
Between 1880 and 1920, about
four million Italians immigrated

00:21:01.570 --> 00:21:06.620
to the U.S. Most in the
decade before the war.

00:21:06.620 --> 00:21:12.260 position:56%
And the songs of serious or
earnest appeal to Italian Americans,

00:21:12.260 --> 00:21:16.650
differ in that most are
not calls for volunteers.

00:21:16.650 --> 00:21:23.020
But rather, songs in support
of the European Italian allies.

00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:27.310
And what of my people?

00:21:27.310 --> 00:21:31.290
The other of the two
largest ethnic groups?

00:21:31.290 --> 00:21:34.570
Well, you'll find a lot of
German names in the collection.

00:21:34.570 --> 00:21:39.040
They're all song writers
and publishers.

00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:43.990
I found two songs,
manuscript deposits,

00:21:43.990 --> 00:21:47.780
about patriotic German Americans.

00:21:47.780 --> 00:21:54.840
We must remember that ethnic
comedy was a staple component

00:21:54.840 --> 00:21:57.540
of the Vaudeville stage.

00:21:57.540 --> 00:22:02.670
And for every one heartfelt
earnest appeal made

00:22:02.670 --> 00:22:08.570
to any particular ethnic group,
there are multiple songs directed

00:22:08.570 --> 00:22:15.300
to that same ethnic group that mock
appearance, accents and customs.

00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:20.290
Ironically, even the stereotype
stuff is couched in terms

00:22:20.290 --> 00:22:24.940
to serve unity and the war effort.

00:22:24.940 --> 00:22:29.110
The Civil War had been
over for a scant 50 years.

00:22:29.110 --> 00:22:32.710
And the grandsons of the
Confederacy, were expected to fight

00:22:32.710 --> 00:22:35.970
and die for the Federal Government.

00:22:35.970 --> 00:22:39.670
Appeals had to be made to the
still disenfranchised south.

00:22:39.670 --> 00:22:44.310
There are Civil War reunion songs,
"Boys of the Blue and the Gray,"

00:22:44.310 --> 00:22:47.130
"Sons of the Blue and the Gray."

00:22:47.130 --> 00:22:52.120
"Dixie Land" and "Yankee Doodle
Land," are one in the same today.

00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:58.270
There are also songs about
or directed to the south.

00:22:58.270 --> 00:23:02.590
All you really need to
do is get to the site.

00:23:02.590 --> 00:23:10.790
And in the search box, type in the
word Dixie and see what you get.

00:23:10.790 --> 00:23:14.270
Unsurprisingly, the bulk
of the collection though,

00:23:14.270 --> 00:23:19.840
is given to the traditional
wartime topics, patriotism,

00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:21.900
home and hearth and women.

00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:27.820
The patriotic stuff is pretty much
what you would expect, my homeland,

00:23:27.820 --> 00:23:31.550
my nation, my flag, my president.

00:23:31.550 --> 00:23:38.280
But there are some topics in there
that are historically important

00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:42.670
or has a -- I'll keep it at that.

00:23:42.670 --> 00:23:47.900
Uncle Sam, the characterization
or the personification

00:23:47.900 --> 00:23:50.130
of the U.S. Government, had been

00:23:50.130 --> 00:23:52.590
around since the early
nineteenth century.

00:23:52.590 --> 00:23:55.980
But his appearances were sporadic.

00:23:55.980 --> 00:23:58.450
His physical appearance
could change.

00:23:58.450 --> 00:24:00.310
His name could be different.

00:24:00.310 --> 00:24:04.940
It was not until here, in
World War One, that the tall,

00:24:04.940 --> 00:24:09.390
goateed man in the red, white
and blue suit, became universal.

00:24:09.390 --> 00:24:13.450
And if this collection has
a star, it's Uncle Sam.

00:24:13.450 --> 00:24:17.800
And in titles, cover illustrations,

00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:22.690
song content, lyrics,
he's everywhere.

00:24:22.690 --> 00:24:27.470
The use of the service flag
is a tradition that began

00:24:27.470 --> 00:24:31.290
in World War One and
continues to this day.

00:24:31.290 --> 00:24:35.050
When a family member in
the military is deployed,

00:24:35.050 --> 00:24:39.330
the family is issued a
small flag or banner,

00:24:39.330 --> 00:24:41.990
bearing a blue star for
that service member.

00:24:41.990 --> 00:24:46.220
Here you see one in
this window here.

00:24:46.220 --> 00:24:49.830
Particularly during World War Two,
it was not uncommon to see flags

00:24:49.830 --> 00:24:52.960
with two, three, four
stars, for however many

00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:55.330
that household were serving.

00:24:55.330 --> 00:24:58.640
If the member is killed in action,

00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:02.300
the blue star is replaced
by a gold star.

00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:07.120
And there's songs about service
flags, blue stars, gold stars.

00:25:07.120 --> 00:25:09.920
And when the blue star
turns to gold.

00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:15.430
And these songs seem to be evenly
divided between the commercial

00:25:15.430 --> 00:25:19.200
and the amateur song writers.

00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:24.050
At that time, the traditional
roles of women still prevailed.

00:25:24.050 --> 00:25:28.570
We have wives, we have patient,
sympathetic sweethearts.

00:25:28.570 --> 00:25:32.650
And first and foremost, centrally

00:25:32.650 --> 00:25:37.060
and most important,
there are mothers.

00:25:37.060 --> 00:25:43.440
In cover illustrations, it's not
unusual to find female architypes.

00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:48.890
You know, often with the long
clarion horn or the sword,

00:25:48.890 --> 00:25:51.730
rallying the boys,
calling to the boys.

00:25:51.730 --> 00:25:53.580
Leading to the boys.

00:25:53.580 --> 00:25:57.270
There's Columbia, there's liberty.

00:25:57.270 --> 00:26:04.020
There are generic noble looking
women in Greek and Roman dress.

00:26:04.020 --> 00:26:08.310
And of course, as we
were going to France,

00:26:08.310 --> 00:26:12.150
Joan of Arc makes her appearances.

00:26:12.150 --> 00:26:16.330
When it comes to women's war
work, there's a slight schism

00:26:16.330 --> 00:26:19.580
between the commercial
and the amateur pieces.

00:26:19.580 --> 00:26:25.280
The commercial pieces are almost
solely given to two occupations.

00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:28.450
The nurse, in particular,
the Red Cross nurse,

00:26:28.450 --> 00:26:31.080
as opposed to the military nurses.

00:26:31.080 --> 00:26:34.850
And the Salvation Army girls,
who dispense coffee and donuts

00:26:34.850 --> 00:26:37.810
and cakes, near the front.

00:26:37.810 --> 00:26:40.550
Again, cover illustrations.

00:26:40.550 --> 00:26:47.070 position:56%
Sometimes you can see women in other
war work, carrying hose or spades

00:26:47.070 --> 00:26:51.380
or maybe driving a truck or
maybe working in a factory.

00:26:51.380 --> 00:26:53.640
But the songs themselves, don't go

00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:58.670
into any great detail
about this work.

00:26:58.670 --> 00:27:03.860
The amateur songs, also
skew heavily towards nurses

00:27:03.860 --> 00:27:06.320
and Salvation Army girls.

00:27:06.320 --> 00:27:09.170
But here you can find songs

00:27:09.170 --> 00:27:14.690
about particular women's
wartime occupations.

00:27:14.690 --> 00:27:18.410
Like, the operation of
the Women's Land Army,

00:27:18.410 --> 00:27:21.540
that replaced agricultural
workers gone to war.

00:27:21.540 --> 00:27:26.310
And the conductorettes that
worked on the railroads.

00:27:29.500 --> 00:27:33.420
How does the collections
treatment of these themes,

00:27:33.420 --> 00:27:38.760
compare with the CPI's agenda?

00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:43.260
Overall, content of the
commercially published pieces,

00:27:43.260 --> 00:27:47.980
is consistent with the
national message of the time.

00:27:47.980 --> 00:27:54.140 position:56%
Public reception, if we can judge it

00:27:54.140 --> 00:27:57.800
from the amateur pieces,
was positive.

00:27:57.800 --> 00:28:03.810
As the vast majority of these
things mime what Tin Pan Alley

00:28:03.810 --> 00:28:05.760
was producing.

00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:07.570
That's not to say that
everything fits

00:28:07.570 --> 00:28:10.190
into a nice big mainstream package.

00:28:10.190 --> 00:28:14.360
Outside the larger
better represented themes,

00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:17.780
there are smaller groups
or individual songs.

00:28:17.780 --> 00:28:23.650
Which are also reflective of
American society at the time.

00:28:23.650 --> 00:28:29.450
And an ethnic group, I hadn't
mentioned earlier, was Eastern

00:28:29.450 --> 00:28:33.960
and Central Europeans who
came here in the millions,

00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:37.030
at the same time the Italians came.

00:28:37.030 --> 00:28:42.600
We can find Polish Freedom Fighter
songs, calling for Polish Americans

00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:47.300
to go back to the homeland
and free it from the Russians.

00:28:47.300 --> 00:28:50.670
And the Austrians and the Germans.

00:28:50.670 --> 00:28:52.980
There are Zionist songs.

00:28:52.980 --> 00:28:55.840
There are anti-Bolshevist songs.

00:28:55.840 --> 00:28:58.130
Some of them calling
for intervention

00:28:58.130 --> 00:29:01.270
in the Russian Revolution.

00:29:01.270 --> 00:29:05.600
The largest group of a war
related special interest songs,

00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:10.840
are songs in support of Wilson's
Internationalists Agenda, i.e.

00:29:10.840 --> 00:29:13.420
; the Foundation of
the League of Nations.

00:29:13.420 --> 00:29:16.250
But you know, you can
also find the other camp.

00:29:16.250 --> 00:29:21.040
You can find more nationalistic
songs that would appeal to people

00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:27.470
like the National Security League
and Teddy Roosevelt's followers.

00:29:27.470 --> 00:29:33.340
The U.S. did not impose food
rationing, during World War One.

00:29:33.340 --> 00:29:36.300
But a Federal Agency,
was established

00:29:36.300 --> 00:29:40.640
that encourage people
to economize on food.

00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:44.980
And looked into things like
better food distribution.

00:29:44.980 --> 00:29:53.190 position:56%
There is, to me, a surprising amount
of songs devoted to this initiative.

00:29:53.190 --> 00:29:57.170
And to the food administrations
rising political star,

00:29:57.170 --> 00:29:59.750
Herbert Hoover.

00:29:59.750 --> 00:30:02.050
There are, of course,
war bond songs.

00:30:02.050 --> 00:30:09.140
And a curious little group of
amateur songs about Pershing's,

00:30:09.140 --> 00:30:13.140
1916 Mexican exertion or incursion.

00:30:13.140 --> 00:30:18.290
That's the one where he failed
to capture or kill Pancho Villa.

00:30:18.290 --> 00:30:22.850
And these songs all promise
that Black Jack is coming home.

00:30:22.850 --> 00:30:26.980
And he's going to take care of
unfinished business down there.

00:30:28.060 --> 00:30:34.710
And it seems that the -- no sooner
was the ink dry on the armistice,

00:30:34.710 --> 00:30:38.830
that some of the disillusionment
and cynicism

00:30:38.830 --> 00:30:43.100
that post-war period was
known for, starts creeping

00:30:43.100 --> 00:30:46.260
into some of the song lyrics.

00:30:46.260 --> 00:30:50.360
Probably the easiest place
to spot them is songs

00:30:50.360 --> 00:30:52.860
about Veterans returning home,

00:30:52.860 --> 00:30:57.120
looking for work, often
unsuccessfully.

00:30:57.120 --> 00:31:01.860
There's even one song called, "Why
Shouldn't They Be Good Enough Now."

00:31:01.860 --> 00:31:07.790
Which is about women war workers
resisting pressure to return

00:31:07.790 --> 00:31:12.410
to domesticity, to make
room for the males.

00:31:12.410 --> 00:31:18.350
Another post-war hot topic
was the impending ratification

00:31:18.350 --> 00:31:21.560
of the Eighteenth Amendment,
the Prohibition Amendment.

00:31:21.560 --> 00:31:27.490 position:56%
And based on the songs, I don't know
how that thing ever got ratified.

00:31:27.490 --> 00:31:30.630
It was not popular.

00:31:30.630 --> 00:31:33.940
There are some pro-temperance
songs in there,

00:31:33.940 --> 00:31:37.840
but they are a decided minority.

00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:45.690
And then we get to my favorites,
which is the occasional piece

00:31:45.690 --> 00:31:50.370
that displays a personal
view or an opinion

00:31:50.370 --> 00:31:54.690
or may even relate an experience.

00:31:54.690 --> 00:31:58.490
Something I noticed, while
working with the collection,

00:31:58.490 --> 00:32:03.720
was that socially conscious songs,
like the one I just mentioned.

00:32:03.720 --> 00:32:07.570
And are they equal, in
the eyes of the law?

00:32:07.570 --> 00:32:12.400
All are self-published.

00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:16.480
I'll let y'all draw your
own conclusions about that.

00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:19.680
There is a manuscript called

00:32:19.680 --> 00:32:24.330
"What Price Has Pershing
Paid for Dead Man's Hill?"

00:32:24.330 --> 00:32:29.810
Which takes issue with
casualties sustained during part

00:32:29.810 --> 00:32:32.260
of the [inaudible] campaign.

00:32:32.260 --> 00:32:35.880
There is another manuscript
called "Heaven."

00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:41.430
Which was written for
the composer's sister,

00:32:41.430 --> 00:32:44.050
who was nurse that
died during the war,

00:32:44.050 --> 00:32:46.660
that was killed during
the war, actually.

00:32:46.660 --> 00:32:52.970
And it's the only mention I found
in the collection that young women

00:32:52.970 --> 00:32:57.140
who served near the front,
could also be casualties.

00:32:58.400 --> 00:33:01.990 position:56%
And then we have, "A Soldiers Wife,"

00:33:01.990 --> 00:33:05.180
which is basically a
hum and hearth song.

00:33:05.180 --> 00:33:11.340
Which tells the tale of soldier
who dutifully sends home his pay,

00:33:11.340 --> 00:33:15.760
only to find that his wife had
spent it all on another man.

00:33:15.760 --> 00:33:19.350
And this is personal favorite
of mine, as it's local.

00:33:19.350 --> 00:33:24.330
It's by Mrs. Carrie Baker of
Martinsburg, West Virginia.

00:33:24.330 --> 00:33:26.710
And one can only speculate

00:33:26.710 --> 00:33:31.810
on what Mrs. Baker's
inspiration for this song was.

00:33:31.810 --> 00:33:33.110
So, there you have it.

00:33:33.110 --> 00:33:36.870
That's the grand tour,
the big overview.

00:33:36.870 --> 00:33:39.070
I pointed out some
of the highlights.

00:33:39.070 --> 00:33:45.880
But again, with almost
14,000 pieces up online,

00:33:45.880 --> 00:33:49.050
there is just so much to explore.

00:33:49.050 --> 00:33:53.620
A whole lot to discover
in that collection.

00:33:53.620 --> 00:33:56.870
The war notwithstanding,
this was an active

00:33:56.870 --> 00:34:00.260 position:56%
and exciting time in American music.

00:34:00.260 --> 00:34:05.070
I mentioned the development
and the rise of jazz.

00:34:05.070 --> 00:34:08.130
People like Irving
Berlin, Cole Porter,

00:34:08.130 --> 00:34:13.140
the teenage George Gershwin,
were young, developing.

00:34:13.140 --> 00:34:18.470
American musical theatre was soon
going to explode, full flower.

00:34:18.470 --> 00:34:21.650
It's probably also
the high-water mark

00:34:21.650 --> 00:34:23.630
of the Vaudeville variety stage,

00:34:23.630 --> 00:34:27.630
before the talkies
and radio took over.

00:34:28.660 --> 00:34:34.890 position:56%
Now, to be honest, I have seen
online, from some other collections,

00:34:34.890 --> 00:34:42.600
a handful of pieces that we
don't have in this collection.

00:34:42.600 --> 00:34:47.920
But that said, this
is still the largest.

00:34:47.920 --> 00:34:52.220
And with the inclusion of the
Vanity Press and manuscripts,

00:34:52.220 --> 00:34:55.410
most comprehensive collection

00:34:55.410 --> 00:35:00.120
of World War One American
sheet music in existence.

00:35:00.120 --> 00:35:06.630
Again, with the Vanity Press and
manuscript stuff, I'm speculating

00:35:06.630 --> 00:35:10.490
that 95% of that stuff
has to be unique.

00:35:10.490 --> 00:35:14.810
Has to be the only
copies left in existence.

00:35:14.810 --> 00:35:20.430
There just can't be too many
copies of great grandma's song,

00:35:20.430 --> 00:35:25.800
still floating around out there.

00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:32.620
And finally, sheet music may
not automatically come to mind,

00:35:32.620 --> 00:35:36.780
when looking for historic
source material.

00:35:36.780 --> 00:35:41.420
But remember that these songs
were written by the people

00:35:41.420 --> 00:35:44.080 position:56%
that were experiencing these things,

00:35:44.080 --> 00:35:48.110
at the time they were
experiencing them.

00:35:48.110 --> 00:35:51.620
And getting familiar
with this collection,

00:35:51.620 --> 00:35:55.260
may help to develop a
better understanding

00:35:55.260 --> 00:35:59.820
of the collective consciousness
of wartime America.

00:35:59.820 --> 00:36:01.620
Thank you.

00:36:01.620 --> 00:36:08.090
[ Applause ]

00:36:08.090 --> 00:36:11.480
And now we're -- David,
right over there.

00:36:11.480 --> 00:36:15.560
&gt;&gt; If you have questions,
please wait for the microphone.

00:36:15.560 --> 00:36:16.860
&gt;&gt; Sorry.

00:36:16.860 --> 00:36:20.920
&gt;&gt; Going back to your point about
over there and its huge influence

00:36:20.920 --> 00:36:23.350
on the American attitude.

00:36:23.350 --> 00:36:27.720
Did Cohan have that
objective in mind?

00:36:27.720 --> 00:36:29.810
Or was it just dumb luck?

00:36:29.810 --> 00:36:32.090
Was there a relationship
between the author and -- ?

00:36:32.090 --> 00:36:36.170
&gt;&gt; Paul Fraunfelter: Cohan
was a known flag waver.

00:36:36.170 --> 00:36:40.400
I mean, from his previous work, you
know, "I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy."

00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:44.280
And he wrote, "She's a Grand
Old Flag," prior to this.

00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:49.210
So, he was patriotic, in his
musicals, from the start.

00:36:49.210 --> 00:36:52.970
You know, was a perfect
storm sort of situation.

00:37:00.040 --> 00:37:05.150
&gt;&gt; Hi. Can you tell my why
so many people published

00:37:05.150 --> 00:37:09.830
through Vanity Press and just
didn't do the copyright themselves?

00:37:11.140 --> 00:37:12.860
I mean, I'm looking at the titles.

00:37:12.860 --> 00:37:18.520
And the titles seem to me, to be
the same as the copyrighted music.

00:37:18.520 --> 00:37:19.900
&gt;&gt; Paul Fraunfelter: Yeah, yeah.

00:37:19.900 --> 00:37:24.470
A lot of -- a lot of just -- a
lot of people just sent it in.

00:37:24.470 --> 00:37:31.040
But well, for the one thing, the
printed Vanity Press, which is,

00:37:31.040 --> 00:37:36.300
you know, the biggest chunk of it,
I mean, your song is printed out.

00:37:36.300 --> 00:37:38.420
It has a publisher's
name on the bottom.

00:37:38.420 --> 00:37:41.920
It has a patriotic
cover on the front.

00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:49.330
Plus, Vanity Presses advertised
and the Library of Congress didn't.

00:37:52.090 --> 00:37:54.430
&gt;&gt; Following up, I'm
still a little confused.

00:37:54.430 --> 00:37:57.470
So, is Vanity Press the only --

00:37:57.470 --> 00:38:01.350
so, what you're saying is that
there's a group of publishers,

00:38:01.350 --> 00:38:08.060
at the time, who will get a
poetry, set it to music, print it.

00:38:08.060 --> 00:38:10.500
And then they promise their clients

00:38:10.500 --> 00:38:12.720
that they will sell it
to other publishers?

00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:14.020
&gt;&gt; Paul Fraunfelter: No, no.

00:38:14.020 --> 00:38:15.320
&gt;&gt; I'm really sorry.

00:38:15.320 --> 00:38:16.620
&gt;&gt; Paul Fraunfelter: Yeah.

00:38:16.620 --> 00:38:17.920
There were two different
business models.

00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:19.220
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:38:19.220 --> 00:38:23.290 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Paul Fraunfelter: One would print
it and then deliver it to the client

00:38:23.290 --> 00:38:25.030
and say, good luck with that.

00:38:25.030 --> 00:38:30.870
Have fun. The other would
take the client's money,

00:38:30.870 --> 00:38:33.160
have their pulper put it to music.

00:38:33.160 --> 00:38:34.460
&gt;&gt; Right, okay.

00:38:34.460 --> 00:38:36.560
&gt;&gt; Paul Fraunfelter: And then
they send them a manuscript copy.

00:38:36.560 --> 00:38:41.110
Now, granted, the copy that we
say there, was in a copyist hand.

00:38:41.110 --> 00:38:44.030
So, most of that stuff
is very legible.

00:38:44.030 --> 00:38:46.660
But yeah, the second model,

00:38:46.660 --> 00:38:51.410
the client just got a
manuscript copy of their music.

00:38:51.410 --> 00:38:54.370
And the promise of, you know,
you're going to be famous,

00:38:54.370 --> 00:38:56.510
once I got somebody to
put it on Vaudeville.

00:38:56.510 --> 00:38:58.540
&gt;&gt; And there were a lot of
different companies who did

00:38:58.540 --> 00:39:00.040
that business model,
is what you're saying.

00:39:00.040 --> 00:39:03.660
So, the term Vanity Press, really
encompasses a number of companies.

00:39:03.660 --> 00:39:05.430
&gt;&gt; Paul Fraunfelter: An
inclusive term, yeah.

00:39:05.430 --> 00:39:06.730
&gt;&gt; Okay, okay.

00:39:06.730 --> 00:39:08.030
That was my confusion.

00:39:08.030 --> 00:39:09.330
&gt;&gt; Paul Fraunfelter:
There were a lot of people

00:39:09.330 --> 00:39:10.630
that practiced in both
business models.

00:39:10.630 --> 00:39:11.930
&gt;&gt; I see, okay.

00:39:11.930 --> 00:39:13.230
I apologize.

00:39:13.230 --> 00:39:14.530
&gt;&gt; Paul Fraunfelter: No problem.

00:39:14.530 --> 00:39:15.830
&gt;&gt; I wasn't totally clear on that.

00:39:15.830 --> 00:39:18.130
Okay.

00:39:21.700 --> 00:39:25.140
&gt;&gt; Since so much of this industry
was concentrated on one street

00:39:25.140 --> 00:39:27.510
in Manhattan, how much
does all of this --

00:39:27.510 --> 00:39:31.970
what was sent to Vaudevillians,
what was actually recorded

00:39:31.970 --> 00:39:34.140
or what was just shipped
back to the writer?

00:39:34.140 --> 00:39:38.610
How much reflects what Ted Cruz
would call, New York values?

00:39:40.370 --> 00:39:42.470
&gt;&gt; Paul Fraunfelter:
New York values.

00:39:42.470 --> 00:39:54.670
I see -- I've seen in the
collection, a lot of, you know,

00:39:54.670 --> 00:39:59.360
old New York Broadway type
of stuff in there, okay?

00:39:59.360 --> 00:40:04.580
I don't know what -- I'm sorry,
but I don't pay a whole lot

00:40:04.580 --> 00:40:06.090
of attention to what Ted Cruz says.

00:40:06.090 --> 00:40:08.610
That's me.

00:40:08.610 --> 00:40:10.400
That's not the Library of Congress.

00:40:10.400 --> 00:40:11.810
That's just me.

00:40:11.810 --> 00:40:14.510
So, I don't know what he was
implying with that remark.

00:40:14.510 --> 00:40:32.350
[ Inaudible Question ]

00:40:32.350 --> 00:40:33.650
I don't know.

00:40:33.650 --> 00:40:36.090
You know, I really
wasn't looking for that.

00:40:36.090 --> 00:40:40.710
I mean, you do get -- you
do get a pretty good mix

00:40:40.710 --> 00:40:44.290
of what America was at that time.

00:40:44.290 --> 00:40:51.030
Everybody kind of in here gets a
little exposure, a little chance.

00:40:51.030 --> 00:40:57.660
And you know, the lower
Eastside Jewish experience.

00:40:57.660 --> 00:41:03.480
You know, the have the, what's it
called, the Yiddish Army Blues.

00:41:03.480 --> 00:41:05.750
You get songs like that.

00:41:05.750 --> 00:41:07.540
I mean, it's like, you know,

00:41:07.540 --> 00:41:09.900
everybody has a little
piece of the pie here.

00:41:09.900 --> 00:41:14.900
It's not, you know,
strictly white bread.

00:41:14.900 --> 00:41:20.030
I mean, you have to figure, too,

00:41:20.030 --> 00:41:26.760
the published stuff here,
was more to entertain.

00:41:26.760 --> 00:41:29.610
It was to entertain and inspire.

00:41:29.610 --> 00:41:36.950
So, the printed stuff was
basically what you see on TV

00:41:36.950 --> 00:41:40.490
and cable today, their
version of that.

00:41:40.490 --> 00:41:46.560
So, you know, there is, you
know, a certain view of America.

00:41:46.560 --> 00:41:51.750
But as far as trying to put
like that type of message

00:41:51.750 --> 00:41:54.050
in there, I didn't see it.

00:41:59.010 --> 00:42:03.700
&gt;&gt; Had a similar amount of sheet
music been generated during the

00:42:03.700 --> 00:42:09.150
Spanish American War on
public sentiments for that?

00:42:09.150 --> 00:42:12.810 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Paul Fraunfelter: I don't know
how many Spanish American War pieces

00:42:12.810 --> 00:42:15.720
there are, to be honest.

00:42:15.720 --> 00:42:18.040
But no, this is the biggest chunk.

00:42:18.040 --> 00:42:26.710 position:56%
Civil War, north and south combined,
are less than 5,000 pieces.

00:42:26.710 --> 00:42:31.340
And that's the next biggest
chunk of war music we have.

00:42:31.340 --> 00:42:35.560
&gt;&gt; Did the recorded music
industry also sell sheet music

00:42:35.560 --> 00:42:36.860
to go along with their hits?

00:42:36.860 --> 00:42:40.060
Or were those done independently?

00:42:40.060 --> 00:42:44.020
&gt;&gt; Paul Fraunfelter: That
was done independently.

00:42:44.020 --> 00:42:49.680
They bought sheet music
from the publishers.

00:42:49.680 --> 00:42:53.240
And in fact, created libraries.

00:42:53.240 --> 00:42:56.830
We have a collection
here that we think came

00:42:56.830 --> 00:43:02.860
from the old Victor Library or the
Edison Library, Edison sheet music.

00:43:02.860 --> 00:43:06.320
So, yeah, they had --
recording companies

00:43:06.320 --> 00:43:12.080
and later radio symphony
orchestras and radio orchestras,

00:43:12.080 --> 00:43:14.490
they had their own music libraries.

00:43:14.490 --> 00:43:19.170
And that was all sheet music
that they published or scores,

00:43:19.170 --> 00:43:24.560
orchestrated scores, in parts
they got from the publishers.

00:43:25.790 --> 00:43:29.740
&gt;&gt; I was wondering, I sensed
that there might be a tension

00:43:29.740 --> 00:43:32.810
between some of the songs
that were emphasizing unity.

00:43:32.810 --> 00:43:34.970
You know, "There's no
Hyphen in My Heart."

00:43:34.970 --> 00:43:36.270
&gt;&gt; Paul Fraunfelter: Right.

00:43:36.270 --> 00:43:37.610
&gt;&gt; And songs on the other
hand that suggested,

00:43:37.610 --> 00:43:40.730
not necessarily divided loyalties,

00:43:40.730 --> 00:43:43.620
but maybe multiple
loyalties or investments.

00:43:43.620 --> 00:43:48.090 position:56%
As when you talked about the Polish
Freedom Fighters calling for action,

00:43:48.090 --> 00:43:53.030
back in Poland, against
say, Russia or Austria.

00:43:53.030 --> 00:43:57.340
And so, I was curious about
that, to what extent do some

00:43:57.340 --> 00:44:02.600
of the immigrant groups, as well
as groups that by then, of course,

00:44:02.600 --> 00:44:05.800
are deeply rooted in the United
States, such as African Americans.

00:44:05.800 --> 00:44:08.860
To what extent do we
see multiple messaging

00:44:08.860 --> 00:44:11.650
or multiple loyalties
expressed in these songs?

00:44:11.650 --> 00:44:13.770
So, that people are
actually speaking

00:44:13.770 --> 00:44:16.940
of fights on different fronts?

00:44:16.940 --> 00:44:20.890
&gt;&gt; Paul Fraunfelter: I know I'm
the poster boy for Vanity Press

00:44:20.890 --> 00:44:22.940
and the manuscript deposits.

00:44:22.940 --> 00:44:29.010
And there is a lot of
bad poetry in there.

00:44:29.010 --> 00:44:38.000
But that is really the value
that amateur stuff serves.

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:43.190
Because yeah, the -- as I just
said, the published stuff,

00:44:43.190 --> 00:44:45.670
the mainstream stuff,
was mainstream.

00:44:45.670 --> 00:44:49.380
It was, you know, general
consumption stuff.

00:44:49.380 --> 00:44:53.490
And you do get into
the amateur stuff.

00:44:53.490 --> 00:44:57.050
And you can see stuff
that is, you know,

00:44:57.050 --> 00:44:59.830
from someone else's point of view.

00:44:59.830 --> 00:45:07.040
Now, again, most people,
like, pretty much ate it up.

00:45:07.040 --> 00:45:13.680
The CPI was pretty effective
in selling the war to us.

00:45:13.680 --> 00:45:21.240
Because the -- it's pretty
consistent during the war of, like,

00:45:21.240 --> 00:45:23.120
you know, this is my experience.

00:45:23.120 --> 00:45:25.800
But you know, being a
Paul, you know, yeah,

00:45:25.800 --> 00:45:27.780
I want to go over there and fight.

00:45:27.780 --> 00:45:30.420
But I want to get, you
know, the damn Russians out.

00:45:30.420 --> 00:45:33.520
And those Germans want to take
over and I don't want to let

00:45:33.520 --> 00:45:35.700
that happen either, you know.

00:45:35.700 --> 00:45:38.150
But it's, like, the end of the war,

00:45:38.150 --> 00:45:43.060
where you start seeing what
we call today dissention.

00:45:43.060 --> 00:45:45.890
Where, as I said, the
guy goes, like, you know,

00:45:45.890 --> 00:45:50.570
I don't think Pershing
should have, like, you know,

00:45:50.570 --> 00:45:52.970
marched straight into those guns.

00:46:02.430 --> 00:46:03.730
&gt;&gt; Thanks.

00:46:03.730 --> 00:46:05.030
A question about the publishers.

00:46:05.030 --> 00:46:08.590
The published manuscript
sounds like, actually, I mean,

00:46:08.590 --> 00:46:13.520 position:56%
I'm speculating, they actually have
the pulse on what the country wants.

00:46:13.520 --> 00:46:15.880
Because they're publishing
things that they think will sell.

00:46:15.880 --> 00:46:20.160
As far as the Vanity
publishing, where would somebody

00:46:20.160 --> 00:46:25.070
like Carrie Baker in Martinsburg,
learn about a Vanity Press?

00:46:25.070 --> 00:46:26.680
Where were they advertising?

00:46:26.680 --> 00:46:29.920
And how were people from all over
the country sending something

00:46:29.920 --> 00:46:31.820
into New York to get
out their songs?

00:46:31.820 --> 00:46:33.120
&gt;&gt; Paul Fraunfelter:
They used to advertise

00:46:33.120 --> 00:46:34.900
in newspapers and periodicals.

00:46:34.900 --> 00:46:37.790
You know, have your
song set to music.

00:46:37.790 --> 00:46:41.940
But I think it lost.

00:46:41.940 --> 00:46:43.780
I think it flew away
[brief laughter].

00:46:43.780 --> 00:46:46.080
I'm sorry.

00:46:48.180 --> 00:46:51.270
&gt;&gt; Do you have any -- I
know these are copyrights,

00:46:51.270 --> 00:46:53.410
so these are everything
that was submitted.

00:46:53.410 --> 00:46:57.670
Do you have any idea
what actually sold?

00:46:57.670 --> 00:47:05.950
And what sort of numbers are we
talking about for the sheet music?

00:47:05.950 --> 00:47:07.310
&gt;&gt; Paul Fraunfelter: No, I don't.

00:47:07.310 --> 00:47:09.110
But it's easy enough to find out.

00:47:09.110 --> 00:47:11.970 position:56%
Because we have the trade magazines.

00:47:11.970 --> 00:47:17.780
Just go over to the performing
arts reading room and look it up.

00:47:17.780 --> 00:47:22.200
And I have friends that will help
you do that [brief laughter].

00:47:22.200 --> 00:47:28.570
Yeah. But a lot of the
recognizable hits are in here.

00:47:28.570 --> 00:47:35.760
You know, of course, over there,
Irving Berlin's, you know,

00:47:35.760 --> 00:47:37.820
"How I Hate to Wake
Up in the Morning."

00:47:37.820 --> 00:47:41.740
Which supposedly was
written about his experience

00:47:41.740 --> 00:47:43.270
as a private in the army.

00:47:43.270 --> 00:47:48.320
And so, my grandfather's
favorite song, "K-K-K-Katy."

00:47:48.320 --> 00:47:49.620
He used to sing that.

00:47:49.620 --> 00:47:52.980
He was a World War One vet.

00:47:52.980 --> 00:47:56.270
So, yeah, there's quite
a bit of it is popular.

00:47:56.270 --> 00:47:59.330
And there's some titles I
recognized when I went through it.

00:47:59.330 --> 00:48:03.360
But even more, I didn't.

00:48:03.360 --> 00:48:07.610
And again, it's just
like anything else it --

00:48:07.610 --> 00:48:12.780
what was popular, is
what the public bought.

00:48:12.780 --> 00:48:15.600
And they did their market research.

00:48:15.600 --> 00:48:19.730
And the whole -- I really

00:48:19.730 --> 00:48:25.890
over simplified Tin Pan
Alley's promotion system.

00:48:25.890 --> 00:48:29.150
I mean, the whole thing
about how many pieces

00:48:29.150 --> 00:48:32.170
of sheet music you
print at the first pass.

00:48:32.170 --> 00:48:35.480
And they used to have kind of like,
I forget what they called them,

00:48:35.480 --> 00:48:37.920
promotional or like fair copies

00:48:37.920 --> 00:48:40.690
about something they were
thinking about printing.

00:48:40.690 --> 00:48:43.770
But they would just print
like about 1,000 pages first

00:48:43.770 --> 00:48:46.250
and you know, distribute them.

00:48:46.250 --> 00:48:49.850
So, I mean, they were market savvy.

00:48:49.850 --> 00:48:52.750
Even though it was 100 years
ago, they were market savvy.

00:48:52.750 --> 00:48:57.690
And you're right, I mean, they had
figures and they were keeping track

00:48:57.690 --> 00:48:59.990
of what kind of stuff was selling.

00:49:03.110 --> 00:49:07.120
&gt;&gt; Is there any anti-war
music at all?

00:49:07.120 --> 00:49:11.670
Is there a Pete Seegre of
that generation, a Phil Ochs?

00:49:11.670 --> 00:49:12.970
Or would they not be published?

00:49:12.970 --> 00:49:15.120
How about in the Vanity
Press, do you see any,

00:49:15.120 --> 00:49:17.000
we shouldn't be in
this fight, at all?

00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:18.580
&gt;&gt; Paul Fraunfelter:
No, just, you know,

00:49:18.580 --> 00:49:23.080
just some of the neutrality
stuff in there.

00:49:23.080 --> 00:49:25.520 position:56%
Just some neutrality stuff in there.

00:49:25.520 --> 00:49:32.400
Again, at the end of the war,

00:49:32.400 --> 00:49:35.200
you start seeing people
second think sometimes.

00:49:35.200 --> 00:49:40.010
But that all comes from the Vanity
Press, from the copyright deposits.

00:49:40.010 --> 00:49:45.800
I've seen nothing in the
commercially published pieces.

00:49:45.800 --> 00:49:49.880
But then again, like I pointed out,

00:49:49.880 --> 00:49:54.760
the potentially controversial
songs, were all self-published.

00:49:54.760 --> 00:50:00.050
So, the, you know, Pete
Seegre got a label here.

00:50:00.050 --> 00:50:03.360
He never would have back then.

00:50:03.360 --> 00:50:07.030
But also, you know,
we have what we have,

00:50:07.030 --> 00:50:11.960
when it comes to the
commercial stuff.

00:50:11.960 --> 00:50:15.640
Apparently and I don't know the
provenance of the collection,

00:50:15.640 --> 00:50:20.110
but apparently, it was
put together sometime

00:50:20.110 --> 00:50:22.480
after the war, it was assembled.

00:50:22.480 --> 00:50:27.660
Because there are dates
from like the twenties.

00:50:27.660 --> 00:50:32.430
There are stamps like
from private collections.

00:50:32.430 --> 00:50:36.120
I found a Korean war
song mixed up with them.

00:50:36.120 --> 00:50:40.010
So, the commercial stuff
is, we have what we have.

00:50:40.010 --> 00:50:44.630
But the copyright deposits,
wouldn't lie.

00:50:44.630 --> 00:50:49.090
And I went looking for
that and I didn't find it.

00:50:49.090 --> 00:50:55.380
But then again, I was trying to get
14,000 pieces of music up online.

00:50:55.380 --> 00:50:59.900
So, you know, go ahead,
it's all up there.

00:50:59.900 --> 00:51:04.970
Do us a service and find
it, the Pete Seegre of 1917.

00:51:07.320 --> 00:51:09.970
&gt;&gt; I think we have time for
one more question if there is.

00:51:15.890 --> 00:51:17.190
&gt;&gt; All right, well, thank you Paul.

00:51:17.190 --> 00:51:18.490
We really appreciate it.

00:51:18.490 --> 00:51:20.290
&gt;&gt;Paul Fraunfelter: Yeah.

00:51:20.290 --> 00:51:24.860
[ Applause ]
