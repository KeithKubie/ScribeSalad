00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Well, congratulations. We talked about a lot in this unit.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
In fact, you learned all the basics of electricity.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
You've learned about the two different types of charge and how they interact.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
You learned several methods for charging a neutral object and how this method relate to lightning.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
We learned a bit about the cause of lightning and discovered that a tall conducting pole

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.000
connected to the ground can effectively catch lightning and safely redistribute

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
both the charge and electrical potential energy into the ground without destroying any buildings.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Next unit would be a bit about many unit on the future of physics as well as the final exam.

00:00:34.000 --> 99:59:59.000
See you next week.
