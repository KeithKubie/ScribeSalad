[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:00.896 --> 00:00:02.340
LAURENCE MORONEY: Welcome
to the Googleplex.

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:04.890
This is an incredible place
with lots of great stuff being

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.680
worked on every single day.

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.660
Before I worked here,
I always wondered

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.960
what it be like to
come to the Googleplex,

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:14.560
meet up with a Googler,
and have coffee with them,

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:16.970
and just chat about what
they do, how they do it

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:18.120
and why they do it.

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:20.210
And today, we're going
to do exactly that.

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:25.750
So welcome to this episode
of "Coffee With A Googler."

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:28.140
Today, I'm meeting
with Francesc Campoy.

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.020
He's a developer advocate on
the Google Cloud platform,

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:33.285
and he specializes in
the language called Go.

00:00:33.285 --> 00:00:34.160
So welcome, Francesc.

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:35.670
Thanks for joining us.

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:36.180
FRANCESC CAMPOY: Oh,
thank you for having me.

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:36.980
I'm very happy.

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:38.022
It's an honor to be here.

00:00:38.022 --> 00:00:39.688
LAURENCE MORONEY: Oh,
thank you so much.

00:00:39.688 --> 00:00:40.380
So, Go.

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:42.017
What's so special about Go?

00:00:42.017 --> 00:00:43.850
FRANCESC CAMPOY: So Go
is a primary language

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.810
that was created five
years ago here at Google.

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:49.850
It was created
with the main goal

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:52.330
of solving Google problems.

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:53.840
The most important
thing when you--

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.090
the most important word that
comes to mind when you think

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:57.210
about Google is, of course--

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:57.490
LAURENCE MORONEY:
Scale, right, yes.

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:58.150
FRANCESC CAMPOY: Scale.

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:58.870
There you go.

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:03.300
So, it's basically scale
in three different axes

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.570
of the same problem
that we have.

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:08.385
One of them is how many
engineers or developers

00:01:08.385 --> 00:01:10.260
do you have per project?

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.160
And Google is pretty well
known to have really--

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:14.841
a really big number
of engineers.

00:01:14.841 --> 00:01:15.840
LAURENCE MORONEY: Right.

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:16.900
FRANCESC CAMPOY:
If those engineers

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:18.500
are using a primary
language that

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.170
doesn't help them interact
with each other, share a code,

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.350
be able to read and understand
what the other wrote,

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:26.440
that's a big problem.

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:27.470
LAURENCE MORONEY: I see.

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:29.178
FRANCESC CAMPOY: So
Go concentrates a lot

00:01:29.178 --> 00:01:33.350
on keeping it really simple,
having very good readability.

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.000
So even if you might not have
read a single line of Go code

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.260
ever in your life, you
might find a Go program

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.340
and find it surprisingly
familiar, actually.

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.006
LAURENCE MORONEY: So it's
not like C++ in that regard.

00:01:46.006 --> 00:01:47.630
FRANCESC CAMPOY: Uhh,
not exactly, yes.

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.650
That's actually-- C++ is the
language that we still use

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:53.241
mostly for servers.

00:01:53.241 --> 00:01:54.240
LAURENCE MORONEY: Right.

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.350
FRANCESC CAMPOY: So Go was
supposed to replace C++.

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:59.480
LAURENCE MORONEY: Ah.

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:01.780
FRANCESC CAMPOY: That
didn't really happen yet.

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:06.420
It actually surprisingly
came-- most people coming to Go

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.960
are coming from other
languages like Python and Ruby,

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.002
because they like the
simplicity of the language.

00:02:12.002 --> 00:02:12.959
LAURENCE MORONEY: Cool.

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:13.801
Cool.

00:02:13.801 --> 00:02:16.300
FRANCESC CAMPOY: The second
axis of scale for these problems

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.905
is the number of cores we
have in a single machine.

00:02:19.905 --> 00:02:22.280
Nowadays, for instance, you
can check on the Google cloud

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.780
platform.

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.814
We provide instances
that have 32 cores.

00:02:25.814 --> 00:02:26.730
LAURENCE MORONEY: Wow.

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.320
FRANCESC CAMPOY: If
you have 32 cores

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.740
and you are not able
to use them correctly

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:34.260
because your primary language
doesn't support concurrency

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.130
or a parallelism, you're
wasting money, basically.

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:38.090
LAURENCE MORONEY: Sure.

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:39.840
FRANCESC CAMPOY: So
it's really important.

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.810
Concurrency is a
fundamental part of Go.

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:48.530
And finally, the number
of machines we're running.

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:50.430
Everything now is
about the cloud.

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.400
The cloud is about running
across a big fleet of machines.

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.746
You need to be able to
communicate correctly

00:02:56.746 --> 00:02:57.870
between different machines.

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.387
But these, we have been doing it
at Google for ages, basically.

00:03:01.387 --> 00:03:02.595
LAURENCE MORONEY: Yeah, yeah.

00:03:02.595 --> 00:03:03.240
It's in your DNA, right?

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:04.156
FRANCESC CAMPOY: Yeah.

00:03:04.156 --> 00:03:06.400
So Go was created from
the beginning keeping

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:07.609
all of those aspects in mind.

00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:08.483
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK.

00:03:08.483 --> 00:03:10.710
Now, Go recently had a new
release dropped, right?

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:11.230
Was it 1.4?

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:12.750
FRANCESC CAMPOY: Yeah,
it was 1.4, yeah.

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:13.625
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK.

00:03:13.625 --> 00:03:14.480
What's in this?

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.760
FRANCESC CAMPOY:
So in Go 1.4, there

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.220
was not much new from
the point of view

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:21.510
of features of the language.

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:22.385
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK.

00:03:22.385 --> 00:03:25.040
FRANCESC CAMPOY: It was
more about improving things.

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.650
One of the things
that we improved

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:29.470
was having a better
garbage collector.

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:31.470
We keep on doing that
every single time.

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.740
That's one of the
topics of research

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:37.075
that we're actually working
on very, very closely.

00:03:37.075 --> 00:03:38.350
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK.

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:40.630
FRANCESC CAMPOY: Then
some small features.

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:44.260
One of the small features
that was not really important

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.570
at that point but will become
way more important on 1.5

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:50.120
is the support for Android.

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.720
LAURENCE MORONEY: Android.

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:51.595
FRANCESC CAMPOY: Yes.

00:03:51.595 --> 00:03:55.820
We gave some basic support
for Android, and with Go 1.5,

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:58.544
the support for Android
will be much more important.

00:03:58.544 --> 00:04:00.460
LAURENCE MORONEY: So
what kind of Android apps

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:02.980
can you build with Go right now?

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:04.940
FRANCESC CAMPOY:
The idea is that we

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:06.960
don't want to replace Java.

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:10.280
Java is the language of Android,
and we're totally OK with that.

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:14.280
What we're trying to do is
replace all the languages

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.720
that people have been
using to, for instance,

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:20.769
write games, where basically,
you're not depending

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:23.320
that much on the UI of Android.

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:25.532
You're basically writing
everything from scratch.

00:04:25.532 --> 00:04:27.740
Your buttons don't need to
look like Android buttons,

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:28.450
for instance.

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:29.100
LAURENCE MORONEY: Right.

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:31.224
FRANCESC CAMPOY: In those
cases, basically what you

00:04:31.224 --> 00:04:35.910
need is to be able to open and
close connections and files

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:41.040
and then basically write into
the screen and play some music.

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:42.470
All of those are
actually powered,

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:45.169
not of the SDK of
Android, but the NDK.

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:46.210
LAURENCE MORONEY: Got it.

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:48.126
FRANCESC CAMPOY: That's
what we're supporting.

00:04:48.126 --> 00:04:52.870
With Go 1.5, we will
give support for Android,

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:54.820
the NDK only.

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:58.160
And the good thing about
this is that what we're doing

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:01.840
is we created this
Go mobile thing.

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:06.310
Go Mobile is just a layer of
abstraction between your Go

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:08.695
program and the Android behind.

00:05:08.695 --> 00:05:09.570
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK.

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:11.070
FRANCESC CAMPOY:
Now, the cool thing

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:12.990
is that that Go Mobile
layer abstraction

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:16.482
has been designed with
multiple platforms in mind.

00:05:16.482 --> 00:05:17.440
LAURENCE MORONEY: Cool.

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:18.990
FRANCESC CAMPOY: So we're
also working on iOS.

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:20.040
LAURENCE MORONEY: Cool.

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:21.415
FRANCESC CAMPOY:
And very soon we

00:05:21.415 --> 00:05:24.420
expect to be able to say, you
can write your app just in Go

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:29.050
and deploy it at the same
time, both on the Apple Store

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:30.960
and on the Play Store by Google.

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:31.170
LAURENCE MORONEY: Nice, nice.

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:31.540
Cool.

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:32.720
FRANCESC CAMPOY: Pretty
excited about that.

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:33.678
LAURENCE MORONEY: Yeah.

00:05:33.678 --> 00:05:35.980
Now, you said that a lot
of that's coming in 1.5.

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:38.060
FRANCESC CAMPOY:
Yes, that's-- by now,

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:40.820
we're able to run
things on Android.

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:42.540
That has been,
actually, the case

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:46.630
for a little bit, because Go is
compiled in a lot of platforms.

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:49.360
ARM is one of those, so you
would be able to run it.

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:53.990
But the possibility of
contacting-- of using the NDK

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:57.180
and being able to use OpenGL
and these kinds of things

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:59.602
on Android, that will
come with Go 1.5.

00:05:59.602 --> 00:06:00.560
LAURENCE MORONEY: Cool.

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:02.567
So it runs on Android,
and you mentioned earlier

00:06:02.567 --> 00:06:03.650
on that runs in the cloud.

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:04.700
But the cloud is so diverse.

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:06.283
There must be lots
of great scenarios,

00:06:06.283 --> 00:06:08.390
like, where else is Go
making good stuff happen?

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:10.140
FRANCESC CAMPOY: Yeah,
so there's actually

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:13.510
so many new projects
that are using Go.

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:16.346
One of the ones that everybody's
talking about is Docker.

00:06:16.346 --> 00:06:17.220
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK.

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:17.730
FRANCESC CAMPOY:
Everybody knows--

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:19.040
LAURENCE MORONEY:
So Docker uses Go?

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:19.410
FRANCESC CAMPOY: Yes.

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:20.750
Nobody knows that
Docker's bringing Go--

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:21.100
LAURENCE MORONEY:
I didn't know that.

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:21.630
FRANCESC CAMPOY: --but it is.

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:23.100
Yeah, it is bringing Go.

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:26.540
There's also all the
things that Cooper Net is--

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:29.500
Cooper Net is also bringing Go,
so Cooper Net is just basically

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:32.120
like the open-sourced
version of how

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:33.710
Google manages data centers.

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:35.257
LAURENCE MORONEY: Right.

00:06:35.257 --> 00:06:37.090
FRANCESC CAMPOY: There's
so many other more.

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:40.040
Corel has, for instance,
new Linux distribution.

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:41.350
They also use Go.

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:43.340
And I think that the
main reason for this

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:46.520
is that because on the
cloud, you need two things.

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:49.210
One is you need to use
very well your machines,

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:51.160
so concurrency is important.

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:54.650
And then again, you need to
use the network very well.

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:57.870
So the networking package
that we have on Google

00:06:57.870 --> 00:06:59.100
works really well.

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:00.960
So it's a little bit of both.

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:03.060
Then the last thing that
I think is very important

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:08.300
is that we provide
multi-platform compilation

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:10.040
and also cross-platform,
which means

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:14.480
that I can compile an
exit binary for Windows

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:15.920
from my Linux machine.

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:17.000
LAURENCE MORONEY: Wow.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:17.916
FRANCESC CAMPOY: Yeah.

00:07:17.916 --> 00:07:21.540
Basically it allows it to
work in whatever environment

00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:24.080
you want, and then deploy it
to the cloud, whatever cloud is

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:25.419
using, which is a great thing.

00:07:25.419 --> 00:07:27.210
LAURENCE MORONEY: Yeah,
that's pretty cool.

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:29.305
So if a developer wants
to get started with this,

00:07:29.305 --> 00:07:30.930
there's so much
diversity there, right?

00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:33.800
So if a developer wants to start
programming in Go so that they

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:35.490
can reach that
diversity, how would you

00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:36.754
recommend they get started?

00:07:36.754 --> 00:07:39.170
FRANCESC CAMPOY: Well, I think
that the most important web

00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:43.560
page to remember is golang.org,
which is the Go home page.

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:45.210
Then from there,
you're going to find

00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:49.420
a variety of resources,
documentation, tutorials

00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:50.380
and so on.

00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:53.625
And there is a specific tutorial
that is really important.

00:07:53.625 --> 00:07:54.500
It's very successful.

00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:55.107
It's Go tour.

00:07:55.107 --> 00:07:56.190
LAURENCE MORONEY: Go tour.

00:07:56.190 --> 00:07:57.398
FRANCESC CAMPOY: The Go tour.

00:07:57.398 --> 00:07:59.200
So that's in tour.golang.org.

00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:00.060
LAURENCE MORONEY:
Tour.golang.org, OK.

00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:00.520
FRANCESC CAMPOY: Yes.

00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:01.400
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK, I'll
have to remember that one.

00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:02.920
FRANCESC CAMPOY: Yeah.

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:04.800
That allows you to
learn Go without having

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:06.050
to install anything.

00:08:06.050 --> 00:08:08.040
So basically, you
get to a web page

00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:10.215
and you're going to be able
to see some instruction

00:08:10.215 --> 00:08:12.680
on the side, some Go
code on the other side

00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:15.750
that you can edit and run and
just play with the language

00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:19.175
and understand the basics
without having to install

00:08:19.175 --> 00:08:20.260
anything on your computer.

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:20.990
LAURENCE MORONEY:
That's pretty cool.

00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:21.980
Great way to learn.

00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:23.896
FRANCESC CAMPOY: Yeah,
I think that's the best

00:08:23.896 --> 00:08:27.320
way to learn without having
to engage into anything.

00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:28.789
Just go there, try it.

00:08:28.789 --> 00:08:30.080
If you like it, that's awesome.

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:31.804
If you don't like it,
well, let us know.

00:08:31.804 --> 00:08:33.970
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK, showing
how we can improve it.

00:08:33.970 --> 00:08:34.993
FRANCESC CAMPOY: Yes.

00:08:34.993 --> 00:08:37.159
LAURENCE MORONEY: Well,
thank you so much, Francesc.

00:08:37.159 --> 00:08:39.242
And thank you for watching
this episode of "Coffee

00:08:39.242 --> 00:08:40.110
With A Googler."

00:08:40.110 --> 00:08:43.320
I've learned so much about
Go, and I hope you have, too.

00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:46.150
So if you want to learn more
about Google and about Go,

00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:48.360

00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:51.476
And if you've any
questions for me

00:08:51.476 --> 00:08:52.950
or any questions
