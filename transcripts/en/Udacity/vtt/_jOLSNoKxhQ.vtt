00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:05.080
A quick fix for this is to be much more explicit in how we want to format our

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:10.780
dates, rather than using some intelligent default that Dimple chooses.

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:13.280
Going back to our editor, a quick fix for

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:18.630
this problem is to simply add a date parts format to our x-axis.

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.090
In this case, setting it to % capital Y.

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:25.440
And while these strings might seem mysterious,

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:29.890
it's actually an old Unix standard called strftime.

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:33.170
And most programming languages and libraries implement it.

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:36.900
So if you ever worked with a date in another language, such as R or

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.220
Python, this should seem familiar.

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:44.060
What this line tells us is to parse the date on the x axis,

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:48.094
which corresponds to year according to this format, %Y.

00:00:48.094 --> 00:00:51.415
%Y actually stands for

00:00:51.415 --> 00:00:56.646
a four digit year, for example, 1966, 1970, and

00:00:56.646 --> 00:01:03.080
there's many other ways to interpret your dates.

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:07.080
But I don't want to spend time now going over every possible way

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.840
to use this STRF time string.

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.340
So I've left a cheat sheet in the instructor note, and if we refresh

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:20.250
our page now, you'll notice that as we hover over any bar the dates are correct.

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.870
In this case 1962, in this case 1966.

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:29.790
One quirk of this is that there's stale placed at the first of the year,

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:35.260
in this case January 1st, which isn't the exact date the gain was at.

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:39.100
Or this World Cup was held, since most of them happen in the summers.

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.690
But for simplicity, let's not worry about this.

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:44.620
And as long as we have the year, that's all we're interested in.
