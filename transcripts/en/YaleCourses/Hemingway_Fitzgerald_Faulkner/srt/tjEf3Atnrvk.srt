1
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:04,590
So we're getting started.
Um, the sound of fury,

2
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:10,190
and this is, um, just want to show
you, um, the field images, um,

3
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:15,370
of, um, Faulkner's Oxford,
Oxford, Mississippi. Um,

4
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:19,050
so this is Rowan Oak,
Faulkner's house.

5
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:24,930
And um, this is actually the old, um,

6
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:28,410
Faulkner family house.

7
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,330
And you notice that I'm actually quite
a few American authors changed the

8
00:00:33,331 --> 00:00:36,660
spelling of the names. So hot on, um,

9
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:40,470
used to be a t. H. O. R. N. E. So, um,

10
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:43,350
the w is an added on and likewise,

11
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:47,020
and it used to be spelled
f a L K and you are out.

12
00:00:47,021 --> 00:00:51,320
So I was just an interesting fact, but
this is a trek dial, a partner house, um,

13
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:56,430
and 1904 and the little boy on a pony,
that's as they thought in there,

14
00:00:56,431 --> 00:01:01,410
right there. Um, so, um,
this is, um, his stature, um,

15
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:05,290
in the courthouse square in Oxford.
Um,

16
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:09,450
and keep that this square in mind,
uh,

17
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:13,030
because in fact it will come back at
the very end, the sound, the fury,

18
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:17,680
the confederate monument in that
squares. Very important, uh,

19
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:21,390
to apply of design if already. So
just to landmark, you know, I mean,

20
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:25,780
it is the most important place in central,
square and arts with,

21
00:01:25,781 --> 00:01:29,400
so it was very important and
falling and sitting right there. Um,

22
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:33,570
and this is an image of him
at work and you see that he's,

23
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:38,460
he was a very bookish author, um,
you know, surrounded by books as he,

24
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:41,010
um, as, as, as he wrote. Um,

25
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:46,070
and so we have to keep in mind that
authors are also leaders as well and what

26
00:01:48,451 --> 00:01:52,250
they read, um, make a
difference to how they write.

27
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:56,070
So both, um, the creator
of his own writings,

28
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:59,620
but also read other people's writings.
Um,

29
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:04,790
and this is the mythic a unit to have you
and then tell powerful accounting your

30
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:10,890
net top county. I can always
have trouble saying this, um,

31
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:15,450
and is mad by Faulkner
himself. Uh, and it's, um,

32
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:20,430
obviously completely made up, but
very much based on, uh, uh, uh,

33
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:22,570
Oxford. And this is, uh,

34
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:27,630
Jefferson Mississippi in
Faulkner's works. So, um,

35
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:32,190
it's, it's just a really interesting
fact of Faulkner's writings,

36
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:35,760
um, that he should create
not just in the theology,

37
00:02:35,761 --> 00:02:39,200
but also a whole landscape
that goes with that. Um,

38
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:43,800
and talking about
Faulkner as, um, a reader,

39
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:48,390
not just an author, but
also, um, sound of the fury.

40
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:52,310
The phrase is taken from the
Beth at five scene five. Um,

41
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:54,990
and it turns out that there's
another phrase that's awesome,

42
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:56,730
very important to him as well.

43
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,000
So tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow
creeps in this petty pace from day to day

44
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:06,820
to the last syllable of recorded time.

45
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:10,600
And all our yesterdays have lighted force.

46
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:16,020
The way to dusty that out out brief
candle lives for the walking shadow,

47
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:23,700
the poor player that struts and Fred's
his hour upon the stage and then is heard

48
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:27,063
no more.

49
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Is it how told by an idiot for
Sam and fury signifying nothing.

50
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:38,060
So the title of the novel,
um,

51
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,470
is taken from the phrase sound and fury,

52
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:46,920
but today's Benji section is
obviously a tale told by an idiot.

53
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:51,100
And that's really the
challenge that Faulkner, um,

54
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:56,280
takes upon himself is to use mental
retardation as a constrain on duration.

55
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:02,890
Um, and to take up the challenge
that comes from that constraint.

56
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:06,180
So, um, and here, um,

57
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:10,450
I want to read you two
accounts of partners, um,

58
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:15,370
on description of how the
sound and the fury began. Um,

59
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:18,970
and one is much less
precise than the other.

60
00:04:18,971 --> 00:04:23,110
And I'll say a little bit about your
upcoming paper in that context. But first,

61
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:28,720
let's look at the two accounts the
thought may himself offers, um,

62
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:31,090
that began as a short story.

63
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:34,270
It was a story without plot.

64
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:39,930
Some children being sent away from the
house during the grandmother's funeral,

65
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:43,810
they were too young to be
told what was going on.

66
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:49,320
And these are things only incidentally
to the childish games they were playing.

67
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:55,490
So, you know, this is a
fine, um, description is,

68
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:58,650
is an okay summary of the sound.

69
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:03,090
The fury is about children at the
beginning of the [inaudible], um,

70
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:04,360
being sent away from the house,

71
00:05:04,361 --> 00:05:08,350
but there's kind of strange
central reality given to
her grandmother's funeral.

72
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:13,310
Um, and not being able to figure
out what was going on. Um,

73
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:16,090
that is not,
not in there.

74
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,980
It is very much in there
in his arm if period. Um,

75
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:24,030
but our experience with reading Benji's
exception isn't really revolving around

76
00:05:24,311 --> 00:05:29,290
that particular event so far other
than obviously has moved away from that

77
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:33,550
initial account way.
So let's look at his second account,

78
00:05:33,551 --> 00:05:34,900
much more precise,

79
00:05:34,901 --> 00:05:38,860
much closer to what we actually
see in the Benji's action.

80
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:44,460
And then the idea struck me to see how
much more I could have gotten out of the

81
00:05:45,671 --> 00:05:50,170
idea of the blind self
centeredness of innocence,

82
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:51,940
typify by children.

83
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:56,710
If one of those children
have been truly innocent.

84
00:05:57,170 --> 00:05:58,820
That is an idiot.

85
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:04,480
So it was born and then I
became interested in the
relationship of the idiot to

86
00:06:06,711 --> 00:06:08,060
the world he was in,

87
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:11,990
but would never be able to cope with.

88
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:15,620
And just where could
he get the tenderness,

89
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:20,210
the hell to show him in his innocence,

90
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:25,990
I mean innocence in the sense that
God has stricken him blind at birth.

91
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:29,510
That is mindless at both.

92
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:33,500
So I'll come back to this
particular very precise, very,

93
00:06:33,501 --> 00:06:37,640
very good summary. Um,
of the Benji's section,

94
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:42,760
but I just want to stop for a moment
and talk about one strategy to keep in

95
00:06:42,891 --> 00:06:43,740
mind,
um,

96
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,000
as you write your papers because
this is a writing wr class.

97
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:52,830
Um, so, um, I want to um,

98
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:58,180
emphasize how important it is to know
exactly what you're trying to do in the

99
00:07:00,411 --> 00:07:02,240
paper.
That is the most important thing.

100
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,640
Knowing what you want to say is important.

101
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:09,170
It's just about the most important thing
as important as having something to say.

102
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:11,850
So that's why,
um,

103
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:17,080
the two assignments that accompany the
first paper at one is the outline in

104
00:07:17,241 --> 00:07:19,730
which you name you itemize,

105
00:07:19,731 --> 00:07:23,000
you enumerate all the things
that you plan to do in the paper.

106
00:07:23,001 --> 00:07:27,240
That's very important.
Um, and the other is, um,

107
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:31,790
kind of more unusual requirement,
um, is the cover page. Um,

108
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:36,050
they're the company as your first paper
that will both describe what you're

109
00:07:36,051 --> 00:07:38,320
trying to do,
um,

110
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:43,600
the parlance that you've run into in
the course of writing the paper and what

111
00:07:43,881 --> 00:07:46,970
you would do differently
if you have more time.

112
00:07:46,971 --> 00:07:50,600
So it was recognizing the fact that you
guys have constraints on you as well.

113
00:07:50,601 --> 00:07:53,150
Time goods, right? You just
have to turn the paper in.

114
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:58,280
But if you had more time, what else would
you do? What would you do differently?

115
00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:03,730
This is to color a self consciousness
about the paper as the paperwork goes into

116
00:08:04,551 --> 00:08:05,384
the paper,

117
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:10,480
what you are free and able to put in
the paper at one moment and what future

118
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:16,160
projects with future versions of
the paper you might want to do.

119
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:16,880
Um,

120
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:21,880
as well as the recognition of what you
are trying to do that you haven't quite

121
00:08:23,091 --> 00:08:24,980
succeeded in doing.
Okay.

122
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:30,280
So that is as important
as well is realizing that
you're trying to do something

123
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:32,720
but you hadn't quite done it.

124
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:35,980
But knowing that that's really
what you should try to achieve. Um,

125
00:08:36,170 --> 00:08:41,120
so that self awareness after slight gap
between what you set out to do and what

126
00:08:41,121 --> 00:08:42,500
you've actually achieved,

127
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:47,770
the self awareness of that gap is crucial
to you on your way to becoming the

128
00:08:49,941 --> 00:08:54,410
writer that you want to be. So, you
know, recognizing rating as the process.

129
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:59,460
Um, you can get them maybe, you know,
three of those are the way still another,

130
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:04,230
um, third of it. Maybe more
than that, maybe, you know,
three quarters of the way. Um,

131
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:06,640
but you know, you're not
completely there. Um,

132
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:11,090
but what else do you need to do in
order in your own estimation to get to

133
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,890
exactly where you are?
So this is, um, you know,

134
00:09:13,891 --> 00:09:17,850
I would just encourage you to give a
lot of thought to those two additional

135
00:09:17,851 --> 00:09:22,800
requirements, the first
writing assignment. But now
let's come back to Faulkner.

136
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:26,280
Um,
and his account of this very good,

137
00:09:26,281 --> 00:09:28,800
very precise account of
the sound of the fury.

138
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:32,370
And we know there's a number of things.
First of all,

139
00:09:32,371 --> 00:09:36,600
the he is defining it is there
in a very peculiar way, right?

140
00:09:36,601 --> 00:09:41,601
He's defining idiocy as the blind
self centeredness of innocence.

141
00:09:42,601 --> 00:09:46,740
He's not using the word mentor,
retired patient that's very,

142
00:09:46,741 --> 00:09:51,741
very important to keep in mind is
not necessarily a simple deficiency.

143
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:56,610
Um, it is blind. So, you
know, it has that aspect.

144
00:09:56,850 --> 00:10:01,590
It is self centered and we'll
think about what that means,

145
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:06,500
uh, for it is to be a form
of self centered in this.

146
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:09,240
But also more than anything else,

147
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:14,310
it is a kind of innocence,
which is a good word for most of us.

148
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:18,990
So what does it mean for it? Is
there to be kind of innocence? Well,

149
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:21,070
think about that.
And in fact,

150
00:10:21,071 --> 00:10:25,590
the argument that I would like to
make is that not only is Benji himself

151
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:29,940
innocent innocence is also
what he demands from the world.

152
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:35,510
Innocence is the impossible demands that
he puts upon the person that he loves

153
00:10:35,971 --> 00:10:37,020
the most catty.

154
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:42,380
And it is that impossible demands that
catty is not able to fulfill and they add

155
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:47,820
[inaudible] does about that.
So both is this about

156
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:53,130
being able to supply that requisite,
that demand,

157
00:10:53,131 --> 00:10:57,840
that innocence that is coming from,
from Benji,

158
00:10:57,870 --> 00:11:02,400
the demands made upon her, um, not
being able to fulfill it fondly.

159
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:07,050
And Faulkner, Ashley
stepping in, um, to, um,

160
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:11,910
supply that lack, um, by his
narrative experimentation.

161
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:13,950
So, um, it's, this is the,

162
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:18,300
what I'll try to show in the
course of this lecture, but, um,

163
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:22,040
I want to contextualize Faulkner, um, uh,

164
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:27,140
against the number of thinkers who also
thought about mental retardation or you

165
00:11:27,391 --> 00:11:31,530
know, the various, uh, ways
of designated that condition.

166
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:36,570
And the most, one of the most important
is the philosopher John Locke. Um,

167
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:40,110
and this is what he says. I'm
new, very, very influential.

168
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:45,040
He was one of the most influential text
written in that end of the 17th century

169
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:49,530
incentive, very afraid, influential in the
18th century, the 19th century as well.

170
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:50,820
Um,

171
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:55,820
John Locke here in seems to the difference
between idiots and madmen that madmen

172
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:03,010
put wrong ideas together
and listen from them,

173
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:08,670
but idiots make very few or no
propositions and reason scares at all.

174
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:16,420
Okay. So we almost recognize something
else in what John Locke is describing.

175
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:21,960
Madmen put wrong ideas together and reason
from them actually he's describing a

176
00:12:23,321 --> 00:12:27,850
lot of the characters and Edgar Allan Poe,
right? So it's sort of recognize that,

177
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:32,710
um, but areas, and this is really
a very good description of what,

178
00:12:32,711 --> 00:12:37,711
five minutes trying to create it is put
very few or no propositions and reason

179
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:43,960
scares at all. So not being able
to put two and two together,

180
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:48,920
not being able to go from point a
to point B, that has been just part.

181
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:53,740
And so point a on beer, always going
to be completely separate, discrete,

182
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:58,690
unconnected dots is not able to
connect all the dots the world.

183
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:03,630
Um, so, so it really goes back to
John Locke in some sentence. Um,

184
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:07,900
and um, in the 19th century, um,

185
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:09,640
the institution,

186
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:13,360
how the what was called a lunatic asylum,

187
00:13:13,361 --> 00:13:18,040
it's not car by that designation. Now a
mental institution is the word we use.

188
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:22,220
Uh, but when it first started
in the mid 19th century, um,

189
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:24,940
harder lunatic asylum,

190
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:29,050
and this is the one in Jackson,
Mississippi and Jackson.

191
00:13:29,051 --> 00:13:32,710
Mississippi is a very resonant
and loaded word in Faulkner.

192
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:38,100
Sending someone to Jackson just
means sending to the lunatic asylum.

193
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:43,540
And it comes up in the sound of your head.
That comes up in as I lay dying.

194
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:48,040
So this is the large scale, um, housing,

195
00:13:48,041 --> 00:13:52,300
concentration of the mentally
retarded in just one place.

196
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:58,090
And, um, as we move on to
the early 20th century,

197
00:13:58,370 --> 00:13:58,960
um,

198
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:03,960
we're beginning to get the newer kind
of taxonomy sciences proceed by way of

199
00:14:04,541 --> 00:14:05,374
taxonomy.

200
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:10,560
So we could get this 1910 [inaudible]
from the American Association on mental

201
00:14:12,161 --> 00:14:15,940
deficiency. So we're sort of moving
closer and closer to our own time.

202
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:19,450
It's mental deficiency.
So the two,

203
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:24,480
three ways to categorize or
classify mental deficiency,

204
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:28,690
um, the most severe form is
the word idiot. So, you know,

205
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:33,720
actually the Falklands taking his word
from that classification is development,

206
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:38,500
arrested, age to embersol. You know,

207
00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:42,220
first it's just of
course, really, you know,

208
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:46,690
that we throw it over people is actually
has a clinical definition arrested

209
00:14:46,691 --> 00:14:50,680
between two and seven.
Um, and moron, again,

210
00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:52,640
whether we use without thinking about it,
uh,

211
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:56,960
has a clinical definition
arrested between seven and 12.

212
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,880
Um, so, um,

213
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:03,390
as you can see by the
early 20th century in,

214
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:04,340
um,

215
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:09,340
the scientific thinking about mental
retardation was moving more and more

216
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:15,050
towards a bonded Tatum approach.
Right? You know, so, um,

217
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,730
we see the numbers right there,

218
00:15:16,731 --> 00:15:21,731
age to age as to the seven
and ages to seven and 12.

219
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:26,870
Um, to quantify what's
developmental stage, um,

220
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:31,500
the, it was arrested, your mental
capacities were arrested. Um,

221
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:36,290
and how that would correlate with
various degrees of mental retardation.

222
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:41,450
Um, the person who was instrumental
was probably the most important figure.

223
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:46,490
Um, and turning a kind of
a quantitative approach,

224
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:51,470
um, into standard practice,
uh, was Henry Garde art.

225
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:55,940
Um, and um, and his quantitative approach,

226
00:15:56,210 --> 00:16:00,770
um, took a number of forms. He was
physical, he was very important, um,

227
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:04,610
as to director of research at the violence
in your school for feebleminded girls

228
00:16:04,611 --> 00:16:09,200
and boys. One of the first and one of
the most important, uh, for 12 years,

229
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:14,330
um, 1906 to 1918 and then he
even more important than that,

230
00:16:14,331 --> 00:16:18,900
he was actually a pioneer in
Iq testing. So the 1908, uh,

231
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:22,490
translation up in these
intelligence testing, uh,

232
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:26,800
it was invented by a French
psychologist, been there, um,

233
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:30,110
and God are translated from the French,
uh,

234
00:16:30,111 --> 00:16:34,430
and was instrumental in getting
it to be widely adopted.

235
00:16:34,431 --> 00:16:35,264
So you know,

236
00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:39,740
what we know as Iq has really dated
from that time was getting completely

237
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:44,600
quantitative numerical measurements.
Um, and then the 1912, he wrote a book,

238
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:49,710
um, kind cat family and inheritance
of feeblemindedness. Um,

239
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:54,710
so this is God as contribution to um,
and widely use.

240
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:58,460
Um, understanding of
mental retardation, um,

241
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:03,050
fall can be seen in many
ways as rejoinder. Um,

242
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:03,590
and uh,

243
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:08,270
maybe a descent departure from
this quantitative approach.

244
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:12,950
Here's it's very much a non
quantitative approach. Um,

245
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:17,060
the quantitative approach not only
anthracite is numerical measurement,

246
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:22,430
but it's very much an objective look
at mental retardation from the outside,

247
00:17:22,971 --> 00:17:26,360
right? You know, it is people
who are not retarded, uh,

248
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:30,170
looking at people who are retarded
and seeing where they're deficient.

249
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:32,690
So the deficiency indexed,

250
00:17:32,691 --> 00:17:37,691
the numerical index is a measurement
of how deficient they are as defined by

251
00:17:38,001 --> 00:17:40,450
people who are not retarded.
Um,

252
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:45,520
farmers tell to my period is fairly
much the tell from inside the mind of an

253
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:47,350
idiot.

254
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:51,960
It is not the total by someone from
the outside looking at Benji from the

255
00:17:51,961 --> 00:17:52,650
outside.

256
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:57,650
It is tow from inside the consciousness
of an idiot with the blind self

257
00:17:59,191 --> 00:18:02,190
centeredness of innocence
being front and center.

258
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:05,150
That is the defining,
um,

259
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:08,580
grime of Benji's world.
Um,

260
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:13,510
so what we get is the suits,
the very recognizable modernist technique,

261
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:15,490
stream of consciousness.
Um,

262
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:19,110
and in this case of allowing for
extreme subjectivity. So, you know,

263
00:18:19,111 --> 00:18:22,350
as opposed to the objectivity
of the quantitative approach,

264
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:25,130
this is extreme subjectivity.
Um,

265
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:30,200
and we see a number of features
associated with this extreme subjectivity.

266
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:34,940
One is we've seen this before,
refresh my memory about this. Um,

267
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:38,580
is that the past and the present
adjust to post, right? So,

268
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,240
and we can call it by different names.

269
00:18:41,290 --> 00:18:44,510
That is non linear chronology.
Um,

270
00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:47,300
we've also seen the private part,

271
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:52,310
primacy of smell and we'll see how that
really is the basis on which department

272
00:18:53,991 --> 00:18:56,940
tells to central story
in the Benji [inaudible].

273
00:18:57,390 --> 00:19:00,060
And another interesting feature
is the incomplete syntax.

274
00:19:00,061 --> 00:19:03,160
I'll talk about all this.
Um, but first, just, um,

275
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:08,270
this is a passage that we looked at
before and just want to bring it back.

276
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:11,890
This is very early in the band section.
Um,

277
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:15,860
just opposing, uh, two moments, um,

278
00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:20,370
that might not seem
connected to the rest of us,

279
00:19:20,371 --> 00:19:25,371
but they are connected in Benji's
mine does you come to meet Katie?

280
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:30,860
She said rubbing my hands while is it
whether you're trying to tell Katty Kay,

281
00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:36,090
smell my trees and like when
she says we were asleep,

282
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,200
whether you're moaning about Lester
said you can watch them again.

283
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:44,080
When we get to the brand here,
here's you the with so you know,

284
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,030
fairy content into they've um,

285
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:51,450
yoking together of two
experiential moments for Benji.

286
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:56,780
You can together one episode having to
do with his sister Cathy young logo and

287
00:19:57,361 --> 00:20:01,330
the other having to deal with
luster, a young black surgeon. Um,

288
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,130
so those two are connected.

289
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:09,050
Benji makes no racial distinctions that
are important to register this flat,

290
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:13,320
no racial distinction. And then
Jews life. That might be one way.

291
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:18,350
Why either it might not be completely
deficient in Faulkner's estimation.

292
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:23,700
Um, but in any case, he's
not making the usual,

293
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:25,740
you know,
distinction,

294
00:20:26,010 --> 00:20:30,720
but he is making instead of the connection
through the sense of smell rates are

295
00:20:30,721 --> 00:20:34,880
catty smelt latreese. Um, lastly,

296
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:36,890
it doesn't exactly smelt like trees,

297
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:41,640
but he's coming up with a good
enough substitute, the Jimson weed.

298
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:45,270
So this is thoughtless
way of substitution.

299
00:20:45,271 --> 00:20:49,280
The logic of substitution is
a play now in Faulkner, um,

300
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:53,840
and last days almost good enough and
it's the sense of smell the connects,

301
00:20:53,841 --> 00:20:56,080
those two moments and Benji's Jay's mind.

302
00:20:56,560 --> 00:21:01,060
So here I want to, um, bring up another,

303
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:05,130
um, psychiatrist, psychologist, um,

304
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:07,690
that you would recognize right away.
Um,

305
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:11,680
and that in some sense father
and is also, um, departing from,

306
00:21:11,681 --> 00:21:15,250
and this is Sigmund Freud. Um, and um,

307
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:18,040
in his classic, um, on

308
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:22,690
civilization and its discontent,

309
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:28,260
Freud argues that the
development of human sexuality,

310
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:30,220
um,

311
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:35,220
makes it less and less dependent on
the census now that the sense of smell

312
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:42,470
becomes, um, less and less central to, um,

313
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:47,670
the demonstration and the
articulation of human sexuality.

314
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:53,250
So this is what throws as the development
of human sexuality seems most likely

315
00:21:55,450 --> 00:21:57,370
to be connected with.

316
00:21:57,371 --> 00:22:02,371
The dual inhibition of the
olfactory stimuli by me is a wish.

317
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:06,520
The Mastro process producers.
And in fact,

318
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:08,170
on the male psyche,

319
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:14,070
the row was taken over by
the visual excitations,

320
00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:19,950
which in contrast to the
incident mitten or factories,

321
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:24,760
stimuli, we're able to have a
permanent effect. So this is,

322
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,730
we assume, recognize
the truth of what, um,

323
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:29,830
of what fry the saying that we don't get,

324
00:22:30,130 --> 00:22:33,040
usually we're not attracted to people
because of the way that you smell.

325
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:37,270
Usually the first thing that gets us
is the way they look. So, you know,

326
00:22:37,271 --> 00:22:41,360
he's described,
I'm not overly generalizing,

327
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:43,900
but I think that that's
probably true of lots of people.

328
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:46,070
It's the first thing that
they see is how some,

329
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:49,810
the first fact that they registered
that anyway is how that person looks,

330
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:54,760
not the way they smell. So
I mean Friday's not, um,

331
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:58,960
not, you know, this is
not untrue, but, um,

332
00:22:59,050 --> 00:23:04,050
the way that he denigrates the importance
of the sense of smell is something

333
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:08,230
that one might take issue with.
Um,

334
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:13,320
and it turns out that fog nerve actually
is taking issue with that denigration

335
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:18,180
of the senses smell.
Um,

336
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:23,310
the sound of fury is obviously about
hearing that announced in the title of the

337
00:23:23,801 --> 00:23:27,430
novel. But the sense of smell
is actually very important.

338
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:32,550
So what I like to do today is to
use the sense of smell as the,

339
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:38,680
in that as the connecting thread
through wish far from the towels,

340
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:42,790
the dramatic story and a dramatic stories,

341
00:23:42,791 --> 00:23:47,791
obviously caddies story told through
the eyes of her brother who loves him,

342
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:49,101
loves her,

343
00:23:49,101 --> 00:23:53,900
but who is completely blind and completely
self center in his love for caddy.

344
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:58,370
So the story goes on there
like this. Um, the innocence,

345
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:03,400
sexual innocence of Cali
is threatened by this.

346
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:08,500
We store precariously risk toward
twice and then it is Trenton yet again.

347
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:16,220
And there's no restoration. This
time it is lost. It's gone forever.

348
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:20,720
And that lost does something to Benji.

349
00:24:20,810 --> 00:24:25,400
And we stayed in a way that is syntax
becomes incomplete and then the something

350
00:24:25,410 --> 00:24:29,750
else that it's lost to Benji as well.
But

351
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,233
father,

352
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:37,360
knowing that innocence has to be
sheltered through acts of tenderness,

353
00:24:38,450 --> 00:24:43,450
is able through his narrative to supply
that af of tenderness that is not coming

354
00:24:46,101 --> 00:24:47,540
anymore from Catholic.

355
00:24:47,541 --> 00:24:52,280
So it's very complicated
story is actually completely,

356
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:57,560
uh, it makes complete sense actually
to me. Um, so in that sense, you know,

357
00:24:57,561 --> 00:25:01,130
it, it's for them staying
extremely coherent story,

358
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:05,840
too complicated, um, non linear
chronology of NGS section.

359
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:06,770
Um,

360
00:25:06,770 --> 00:25:11,770
but it is a story that
we have to reconstruct by
following one particular phrase

361
00:25:15,230 --> 00:25:17,450
that has to do with the census now.

362
00:25:17,930 --> 00:25:22,930
So let's go to the first step of innocence
becoming dangerously in Japanese,

363
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:31,640
but being restore in the
nick of time. Okay. So, um,

364
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:36,880
and caddy put her arms around me and a
Shining Vale and I couldn't smell the

365
00:25:38,211 --> 00:25:43,200
trees and ignore and I began to cry.
Benjamin,

366
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:47,780
Kathy said Benjy she put her arms around
me again and I went away. What is it?

367
00:25:47,781 --> 00:25:49,850
Benji just said,
isn't this hat?

368
00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:54,860
She told her hat off and came
again and I went away. Benji,

369
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:57,890
she that, what is it Benji?
Well, this can be done.

370
00:25:58,550 --> 00:26:01,820
I went to the bathroom door,
I could hear water.

371
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:04,190
I listened to the water,

372
00:26:04,970 --> 00:26:08,600
I couldn't hear the water
and Kelly opened the door.

373
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:14,740
[inaudible] she said she looked at me and
I went and she put her arms around me.

374
00:26:15,530 --> 00:26:19,700
Did you find Hattie again?
She said she think how they have run away.

375
00:26:20,610 --> 00:26:23,690
Hey, smell like trees. Okay.

376
00:26:23,691 --> 00:26:28,691
So that is the phrase that is going to
be our guide in the reconstruction of the

377
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:35,120
drama that Faulkner is giving us.
Um,

378
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:40,240
and we know this right away that Kelly
is the supplier of tenderness for a good

379
00:26:41,571 --> 00:26:44,180
pot of Benji's section.
Hookers.

380
00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:49,230
Ristick gesture is putting her arms around
Benji and we can think of it both in

381
00:26:50,791 --> 00:26:54,300
terms of the physical act of
putting her arms around Benji,

382
00:26:54,630 --> 00:26:58,760
but also wrapping her mind around Benji.
Um,

383
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:02,400
someone who's not able to
tell her what is wrong. Right?

384
00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:07,430
So Kathy tried to figure out what it
is that is making Benji cry and wish I

385
00:27:08,071 --> 00:27:11,580
remember the all this
time when Benji is crying,

386
00:27:11,610 --> 00:27:16,470
it's actually making this incredible
noise is this battling that's just filling

387
00:27:16,471 --> 00:27:20,630
up the whole house unbearable.
Um, so you know, just like, um,

388
00:27:20,670 --> 00:27:24,180
the noise and Hemingway's Indian camp,

389
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:27,600
this is unbearable noise coming
from Benji. So, you know,

390
00:27:27,601 --> 00:27:29,820
just to stop that noise.
Um,

391
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:34,940
Kelly is to figure out what it is that
is upsetting Benji to this extent.

392
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:38,580
And she tries out a number
of explanations. Right.

393
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:42,900
So is it this hat that I'm wearing that
you don't mind? This making use of upset?

394
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:47,000
Wrong answer.
Can I figure out figures,

395
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:48,510
figures out the answer.

396
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:53,720
And it has to do with something that
requires go into the bathroom and turning

397
00:27:54,331 --> 00:27:55,164
on the Faucet.

398
00:27:55,560 --> 00:28:00,560
So this is the only thing that Benji
is going to tell us is that Kelly has

399
00:28:02,131 --> 00:28:04,170
figured out what it is.
She goes to the bathroom,

400
00:28:04,171 --> 00:28:09,000
he hears the water running while the runs
for awhile can hear the water anymore.

401
00:28:09,090 --> 00:28:13,500
Kenny comes out,
everything is okay again.

402
00:28:13,890 --> 00:28:18,600
Kennedy puts her arm around
Benji Kelly's mouth, like trees,

403
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:22,290
everything is okay and
lessons has been restored.

404
00:28:22,291 --> 00:28:27,291
So what is it that was
really upsetting Benji.

405
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:31,920
We found out very soon. Next page after
they've talked me. It actually isn't it?

406
00:28:31,921 --> 00:28:35,370
So, um, you know, impossible
to read. I mean, you know,

407
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:37,770
this is fairly close.

408
00:28:38,270 --> 00:28:43,200
Cluing in what exactly?
Uh, was upsetting to Benji.

409
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:48,180
They'll say, Kathy said Benji
has gone to prison for you.

410
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:52,500
She stooped down and put
the bottle in my hand,

411
00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:55,230
holding out to go.
They'll now,

412
00:28:56,250 --> 00:28:59,280
Kelly held my hand and
their see took the bottle.

413
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:03,530
Well I declare due season
if my baby and give,

414
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:06,150
they'll see a bottle of perfume.

415
00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:10,380
Just look here at Roscoe's caddies.
Smells like trees.

416
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:15,510
We don't like earthy ourselves.
Said she smelled like cheese.

417
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:18,300
So that is what was upsetting.

418
00:29:18,770 --> 00:29:23,770
And J is the use of perfume that sign
that Hattie is on her way to losing

419
00:29:26,190 --> 00:29:28,620
homosexual innocence.
Um,

420
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:33,800
and what is really interesting is that
on this occasion a is able to do exactly

421
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:36,620
what is needed.

422
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:41,620
Much gives away the perfume
and she uses the Pronoun we,

423
00:29:41,690 --> 00:29:43,660
we don't like perfume anymore.

424
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:48,940
This fusing of herself and Ben j even
though really is Benji who objects to the

425
00:29:50,111 --> 00:29:51,690
perfume,
uh,

426
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:56,830
after putting her on both physically and
metaphorically around Ben j Kelly uses

427
00:29:57,491 --> 00:29:59,830
the more encompassing pronoun we,

428
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:04,860
that is the syntactic equivalent to the
physical act of putting her arm around

429
00:30:05,111 --> 00:30:05,944
Benji.

430
00:30:06,250 --> 00:30:10,990
So this is one moment when
we can see this clear danger.

431
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:14,770
The danger has been averted.
Innocence has been restored.

432
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:18,940
Let's look at one other moment
when that happens again.

433
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:21,423
Um,

434
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:27,000
it was two now and then one in the swing
headache came fast way in the darkness.

435
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:35,200
Benji, she said, how did you
slip up? Where's version?

436
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:40,800
She put her arms around me and I hush
and held to her dress and try to away

437
00:30:42,870 --> 00:30:44,140
caddy and I ran,

438
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:49,560
we ran up the kitchen steps onto the
porridge and caddied now done in the dark

439
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:55,840
and held me.
I could hear her and feel her chest.

440
00:30:56,020 --> 00:31:00,370
I won't, I won't anymore
ever. Benji Benji.

441
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:04,660
Then she was crying and I cried
and we held each other hush.

442
00:31:04,690 --> 00:31:07,480
Just hush.
I won't anymore.

443
00:31:08,050 --> 00:31:13,050
So I hush and Kenny got up and we went
into the kitchen and turn the light on

444
00:31:15,030 --> 00:31:20,030
and catty took the kitchen so and wash
your love at the same hot Tevye smelled

445
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:25,360
like trees. Once again,
that's very reliable.

446
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:28,720
Thread that five minutes giving us.

447
00:31:29,170 --> 00:31:34,170
So we've just looked at one kind of re
of arithmetic and the earlier use of the

448
00:31:35,411 --> 00:31:40,411
Pronoun we re catty and Benji being two
different people but being turned into a

449
00:31:42,461 --> 00:31:46,690
single unit by that first person thorough.
We,

450
00:31:47,410 --> 00:31:52,330
the two of them had become one in
that earlier moment here. This,

451
00:31:52,331 --> 00:31:57,331
the repetition of that kind of logic
except that it is not Benji who's been

452
00:31:58,331 --> 00:31:59,760
fused with chaotic,

453
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:05,240
it was two now and then one in the
swim calving and who bow in this way,

454
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:13,380
the two of them becoming one and it is
that site that is unbearable to Benji.

455
00:32:16,210 --> 00:32:21,070
So that's why she was crying and
caddied this time doesn't have to guess.

456
00:32:21,130 --> 00:32:25,330
She knows it's not clear what it is
that is upsetting. Bangy so much.

457
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:27,040
So once again,

458
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:32,550
she tries her best to make
things okay for the energy again,

459
00:32:32,570 --> 00:32:36,420
she puts her arm around Benji.
Um,

460
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:41,330
and then she does what is one more time.
Um,

461
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:45,680
and it is within the capacity
to do what is needed.

462
00:32:45,681 --> 00:32:49,460
So she goes to the kitchen
is not the bathroom,

463
00:32:49,461 --> 00:32:54,200
but it's the same really the equivalent
functional equivalent of the bathroom,

464
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:59,450
um, turns the light on turns on
the faucet one more time, right?

465
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:01,340
This necessary ingredient.

466
00:33:01,341 --> 00:33:06,341
Now those are the necessary ingredients
to the restoration of innocence.

467
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:10,160
Faster soap and water
washing out her mouth.

468
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:14,230
So she wants again,
smells like trees. So, um,

469
00:33:14,330 --> 00:33:19,330
we can see that cat is doing everything
that Benji is demanding from her,

470
00:33:21,770 --> 00:33:26,420
but I think that we can also see
how unreasonable Benji is. Right?

471
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:30,260
So let's not romanticize
Benji and you know,

472
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:34,310
just call him innocent.
He is innocent,

473
00:33:34,311 --> 00:33:35,570
but this is an innocent,

474
00:33:35,571 --> 00:33:39,520
that is not only blind
to the needs of catty.

475
00:33:39,570 --> 00:33:41,960
She is going to become a woman.

476
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:44,660
She's not going to be
able to wash yourself,

477
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:47,940
clean every time with soap and water.
Um,

478
00:33:48,170 --> 00:33:53,170
and Benji is simply has no recognition
of catty as a separate person who has her

479
00:33:55,190 --> 00:33:57,800
own developmental path.

480
00:33:57,801 --> 00:34:02,801
She's going to turn from a young girl to
a woman that's her developmental path.

481
00:34:04,190 --> 00:34:09,050
And because Benji is arrested at age two,
he wants everybody or you know,

482
00:34:09,051 --> 00:34:12,050
whatever age to age four,
um,

483
00:34:12,110 --> 00:34:14,750
because he's arrested
in such an early age,

484
00:34:14,870 --> 00:34:19,870
he wants everybody to be developmentally
arrested at that age as well.

485
00:34:20,631 --> 00:34:25,631
With that degree of innocence and
bad Katie is not able to do for him.

486
00:34:26,870 --> 00:34:31,250
So it is a very, um, uh,

487
00:34:31,550 --> 00:34:32,630
impossible,

488
00:34:32,660 --> 00:34:37,660
very self centered kind of
demand that Benji is imposing.

489
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:41,960
Um, on Kelly, and in that sense,

490
00:34:42,410 --> 00:34:44,870
sowing the seed of its own destruction.

491
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:48,170
It is at the demand that cat is,

492
00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:53,230
can never meet in the long run is almost
like the impossible demand that gaspy

493
00:34:55,870 --> 00:34:57,860
is putting on these. Right. You know,

494
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:02,920
we're beginning to see actually a
pattern of people who love intensely,

495
00:35:03,350 --> 00:35:06,200
um,
but in a very intensity of the love,

496
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:10,620
putting an impossible demand
on the love object. Um,

497
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:15,080
just no human being is capable
of meeting that demand.

498
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:19,970
Um, so not surprisingly, we see,

499
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:21,530
um,

500
00:35:21,530 --> 00:35:26,530
this time caddy failing Benji and see
what's in this passage and what is not.

501
00:35:29,211 --> 00:35:31,880
In this passage,
we were in a hall,

502
00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:37,190
caddy was still looking at me.
A hand was against her mouth.

503
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:42,710
She stopped again against the wall looking
at me and I cried and she went on and

504
00:35:44,491 --> 00:35:49,220
I came on crying as just ran
against the wall looking at me.

505
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,390
She opened the door to her room,

506
00:35:51,391 --> 00:35:56,220
but I bought a red dress and we went into
the bathroom and she stood against the

507
00:35:56,221 --> 00:35:58,560
door looking at me though,

508
00:35:58,561 --> 00:36:01,500
should put her arm across her face.

509
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:04,110
And I've posted her cry.

510
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:11,240
So the Kurds rustic
gesture coming from Kelly,

511
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:16,400
putting her arms around Benji that
is not here in this passage as that,

512
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:23,360
just putting her arm across on those as
just doing this because Benji is trying

513
00:36:23,671 --> 00:36:27,240
to get her to go the bathroom,
you know, to achieve that,

514
00:36:27,330 --> 00:36:30,600
that previously try then,
you know,

515
00:36:30,601 --> 00:36:35,601
solution that worked before on
Benji [inaudible] one more time.

516
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:40,110
This time,
best solution isn't going to work.

517
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:45,680
So we see it in the nonappearance of that
gesture coming from catty arms around

518
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:50,220
years.
She's now able to do that.

519
00:36:50,550 --> 00:36:53,460
And we also see that non
appearance of that phrase,

520
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:58,780
Kelly's smell like triaged smell and
trees anymore and she never world smell

521
00:36:59,161 --> 00:37:00,000
like trends again.

522
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:05,300
So this is a five way of telling the
story of loss of sexual interactions,

523
00:37:07,790 --> 00:37:08,100
um,

524
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:13,050
completely through the sense of smell
and through it's very indirect way of

525
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:18,710
channeling it through of the mind
of some of us were mentally recall,

526
00:37:18,770 --> 00:37:23,630
the retired or who can mean they can
vision can't really need that loss. Uh,

527
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:28,320
but who registered that lost as
a sensory loss rate, you know,

528
00:37:28,321 --> 00:37:32,910
so he's not able to reason
but his senses to how him,

529
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:36,620
what actually has happened. So you know,

530
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:41,660
this is one way in which Benji
Ashley both knows and not knows me.

531
00:37:42,151 --> 00:37:45,390
He knows really in the sense that
his reaction and says that he knows,

532
00:37:45,690 --> 00:37:48,870
but he doesn't know in the sense that
he doesn't, can you give them reason,

533
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:51,210
can mean the condition.
Um,

534
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:56,240
so let's look at the consequences
of that lost on Kelly's,

535
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:04,530
what happens to energy within the losers.
Caddy in this way.

536
00:38:05,070 --> 00:38:10,070
And the way father is telling that
story is by this technique af Benji not

537
00:38:12,481 --> 00:38:14,340
finishing his sentences.

538
00:38:14,370 --> 00:38:18,490
So let's look at this income
fixed impacts in the very, um,

539
00:38:18,690 --> 00:38:21,480
all the way through. Um,
the, the Benji action,

540
00:38:21,870 --> 00:38:26,580
but especially striking in this moment.
They came on,

541
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:30,350
I opened the gate and they start telling,

542
00:38:30,930 --> 00:38:35,920
I was trying to say a
quarter trying to say,

543
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:41,700
and she screamed and I was trying to say
and trying and the right shapes began

544
00:38:42,521 --> 00:38:46,000
to stop.
And I tried to get up the trolley,

545
00:38:46,001 --> 00:38:50,440
get it off of my face,
but the bright shapes we're going again.

546
00:38:50,910 --> 00:38:55,570
They would go on up the hill to where
it fell away. And I tried to cry,

547
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:59,860
but when I breathe in,
I couldn't breathe out again to cry.

548
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:04,650
And I try to keep from falling off the
hill and then fell off the hill and to

549
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:06,820
write whether the shapes.

550
00:39:08,050 --> 00:39:11,620
So it is tow as a jumble of sensations.

551
00:39:11,670 --> 00:39:16,630
How is this the only way, and you can
tell the story, but we can sort of know,

552
00:39:16,690 --> 00:39:20,980
you know, roughly what is
going on. Um, someone, we,

553
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:25,570
we need more to know that someone had
left the gate open. So some school goes,

554
00:39:25,571 --> 00:39:30,490
we're going by and Benji had
lost Kelly at this point.

555
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:34,320
He sees the school goes, it's always
looking for substitutes for candidate.

556
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:39,130
So he grabs one of those school
goes, um, I caught her trying to say,

557
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:44,170
and we can almost see that this is what
happens to this is the consequences of

558
00:39:44,171 --> 00:39:49,171
what happens to Benji when
this not caddied there to
complete his sentences for

559
00:39:50,771 --> 00:39:52,060
him. Right. Catty,

560
00:39:52,270 --> 00:39:56,920
putting her arm around Benji is
her way of finishing his sentences,

561
00:39:57,250 --> 00:40:01,430
saying what he cannot save
himself. She's not there, um,

562
00:40:01,510 --> 00:40:02,620
to do that for him.

563
00:40:02,890 --> 00:40:07,240
So Benji sentences are
left hanging incomplete,

564
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:11,740
always trying to say, uh, without the, uh,

565
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:13,690
predicate without an object,
uh,

566
00:40:13,810 --> 00:40:17,700
without just as grammatical
compliments who, uh,

567
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:21,260
finishing that sentence. Um, and um,

568
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:26,410
that's just how things are going to
be for him forever. Um, you know,

569
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:29,590
trying to say something, trying to, um,

570
00:40:30,190 --> 00:40:34,450
express himself to the world without the
resources of the language and without

571
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:35,920
Amanda capacity to do so.

572
00:40:36,250 --> 00:40:40,740
So we also know what happens when you
know that really this is the moment.

573
00:40:40,770 --> 00:40:44,680
What is Faulkner is actually
registering mental deficiency.

574
00:40:44,710 --> 00:40:49,180
Something is lacking from the Eia
is missing from Benji's. Well, um,

575
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:52,890
and something is happening
to be energy as well as red.

576
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:57,660
It looks like something has been put
on his face. Um, he can breathe, um,

577
00:40:57,820 --> 00:41:02,050
that he is fighting it,
but this thing is happening to him.

578
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:07,040
So what is it that's happening
to Benji at this moment? Uh,

579
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:12,060
we see the physical manifestation was
happening to him just a little later.

580
00:41:15,690 --> 00:41:20,690
I got an address and I looked at
myself and I began to cry hush.

581
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:24,213
Those that said,

582
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:29,560
looking at looking for them
in going to do no good,

583
00:41:30,370 --> 00:41:34,010
they are gone. Okay. So

584
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:38,660
that is what happens
to Benji. Um, you know,

585
00:41:38,661 --> 00:41:41,810
I don't think it was, you know, I
think that we know what happens.

586
00:41:41,811 --> 00:41:45,740
We know that people who
are mentally retarded,

587
00:41:45,770 --> 00:41:49,880
who are threatened to others get
castrated. It's still happens.

588
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:55,160
Um, so, um, is, um, a very graphic,

589
00:41:55,820 --> 00:41:56,960
um,
uh,

590
00:41:57,020 --> 00:42:02,020
rendition of the lost that comes
to Benji when he loses caddy.

591
00:42:04,490 --> 00:42:05,211
But you know,

592
00:42:05,211 --> 00:42:09,710
I would say even though it was
a horrible fate and you know,

593
00:42:09,711 --> 00:42:11,760
Benji can really bear
to look at it himself.

594
00:42:11,761 --> 00:42:16,100
So he really has that degree
of self consciousness. Um,

595
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:19,610
but I have to say that it actually shows,
um,

596
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:24,270
some degree of narrative
tenderness on the part of the fog.

597
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:28,040
And I really want to emphasize
those because they magically,

598
00:42:28,190 --> 00:42:31,040
the tendonitis got not going
to come from caddy. You know,

599
00:42:31,070 --> 00:42:32,690
she's lost that ability.

600
00:42:33,410 --> 00:42:38,410
So something else has to supply that
tenderness that will show it and shelter

601
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:43,010
Benji and thought that is
the one who was doing this.

602
00:42:43,250 --> 00:42:48,200
So on the one hand it is terrible that
there should be that lost coming to

603
00:42:48,210 --> 00:42:49,043
Benji.

604
00:42:49,490 --> 00:42:54,490
But at the same time that lost once again
establishes a bond trading Benji and

605
00:42:57,560 --> 00:42:58,010
having,

606
00:42:58,010 --> 00:43:02,710
they do have something in common even
though had he doesn't know it and Ben j

607
00:43:02,750 --> 00:43:07,100
the last person to be able to say it.
And then that condition nonetheless,

608
00:43:07,101 --> 00:43:11,600
there is a bond is almost as though Kenny
has suffered this terrible thing that

609
00:43:11,601 --> 00:43:16,280
she was very there, she was devastated
by it. This was a point in time where,

610
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:20,510
um, you know, to be, um, um, to,

611
00:43:20,570 --> 00:43:25,340
to have that loss is a kind of
incredible stigma on, on, on, on, on,

612
00:43:25,370 --> 00:43:30,080
on, on caddy, um, that when
something's rooms alive, um,

613
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:35,100
and Benji's live is also
ruined, devastated, um,

614
00:43:35,210 --> 00:43:36,770
in a parallel fashion.

615
00:43:37,130 --> 00:43:40,910
So the two of them as they do have it
would have been pushed this point so far

616
00:43:40,911 --> 00:43:45,020
as lily, not the consultation to anyone
to have that particular thing in common.

617
00:43:45,020 --> 00:43:49,870
But this is the cemetery,
um, that Faulkner is, uh,

618
00:43:49,970 --> 00:43:54,920
creating, creating for Benji
and, and, and catty. Um,

619
00:43:54,980 --> 00:43:59,980
we'll look at one other moment and this
is the very and of the Benji section,

620
00:44:02,540 --> 00:44:07,290
um, in which we see maybe a
more compelling, more, um,

621
00:44:09,070 --> 00:44:14,030
you know, um, persuasive,
uh, way in which, um, uh,

622
00:44:14,031 --> 00:44:19,031
shelter could be device for Benji
without it being physically there.

623
00:44:21,740 --> 00:44:25,370
So this is the very,
and of the [inaudible] section,

624
00:44:26,510 --> 00:44:29,270
and I'm telling you what I want to say,

625
00:44:29,540 --> 00:44:33,290
but obviously we're back
to experimentation, um,

626
00:44:33,510 --> 00:44:36,550
on the part of the Faulkner.
But let's just look at his. Um,

627
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:40,770
father went to the door
and look at us again.

628
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:46,320
The dog came back and he's too black in
the door and then the door turn black

629
00:44:47,191 --> 00:44:49,470
again.
Kelly tells me,

630
00:44:49,890 --> 00:44:54,840
and I put here is all and the
jobless and something I could smell.

631
00:44:56,190 --> 00:45:01,140
And then I could see the windows where
the trees were busing than a doc began to

632
00:45:01,141 --> 00:45:04,890
go and smooth bright
shapes like it always does.

633
00:45:05,370 --> 00:45:08,700
Even when caddies says
that I have been asleep.

634
00:45:10,050 --> 00:45:10,470
Um,

635
00:45:10,470 --> 00:45:15,360
this is coming at the very end of Veggie
section where they study three and back

636
00:45:15,361 --> 00:45:17,940
again to being a young boy.
Right?

637
00:45:17,941 --> 00:45:22,500
So this is what the nonlinear
finally reveal to us.

638
00:45:22,890 --> 00:45:26,030
What the nonlinear chronology
is doing for Benji.

639
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:30,000
B being 33 is no place for Benji to be,

640
00:45:30,620 --> 00:45:32,160
it's a terrible place.

641
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:35,940
No one wants to in his
condition at this course,

642
00:45:35,941 --> 00:45:40,800
the age when Christ was crucified
and obviously that's in Redlands. Um,

643
00:45:40,860 --> 00:45:41,640
so he,

644
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:46,640
Benji is going to be crucified at
age 33 and father doesn't want him,

645
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:54,270
you know, was that crucification
to happen and to be registered.

646
00:45:54,750 --> 00:45:59,750
But he doesn't want that to be
the experiential ending for Benji.

647
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:05,760
So because he is telling the
story in a nonlinear fashion,

648
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:10,680
he can choose to end the
story at a much earlier point.

649
00:46:10,710 --> 00:46:15,600
And he can do that because
path and presence that always
just oppose and benches

650
00:46:15,601 --> 00:46:19,320
mind anyway. And he can tell the
difference between past and present.

651
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:22,290
So at the ferry and a brand new section,

652
00:46:22,291 --> 00:46:25,500
he actually goes back this
a bit of time travel for,

653
00:46:25,740 --> 00:46:29,340
he gets to go back to a very
satisfying moment in time.

654
00:46:29,790 --> 00:46:34,570
And let's look at how this moment
reconstitutes all those things to the

655
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:36,900
[inaudible] to Benji.
Um,

656
00:46:36,930 --> 00:46:40,890
the dark comes back to trees about
saying so you know, this, this um,

657
00:46:41,070 --> 00:46:43,840
sight and sound fuse.
Um,

658
00:46:43,950 --> 00:46:48,950
that really is the kind of the defining
feature of a band as well and have no

659
00:46:49,681 --> 00:46:54,180
explanation of law but very
reassuring. Um, visual images.

660
00:46:54,390 --> 00:46:54,840
Um,

661
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:59,610
father still alive are black and the
door and then the door turning black and

662
00:46:59,611 --> 00:47:02,460
that's how Benji wants it to be,
wants to be asleep,

663
00:47:02,461 --> 00:47:06,890
wants to be in bed with
Katee holding him and um,

664
00:47:06,930 --> 00:47:09,810
he could smell something

665
00:47:11,340 --> 00:47:16,340
was really interesting is that there's
almost no need to mention that Kelly

666
00:47:17,110 --> 00:47:21,930
smells like cheese and there
actually is the best envision.

667
00:47:23,130 --> 00:47:28,130
Even that phrase caddies smelt like
smelled like trees already suggest that is

668
00:47:28,610 --> 00:47:31,230
she was in of not smelling like trees,
right?

669
00:47:31,740 --> 00:47:36,740
Bend in this dimension that Kelly's melt
like trees when she started smelling

670
00:47:36,791 --> 00:47:41,720
like trees when Nolan. And so even
the appearance of that phrase say,

671
00:47:41,770 --> 00:47:45,190
knows that there's already a danger
present and maybe has been avoided,

672
00:47:45,191 --> 00:47:48,640
but they injured,
has been there not been able to name that.

673
00:47:48,641 --> 00:47:53,140
And she actually also smells a month on
home muddy draws that she's completely

674
00:47:53,141 --> 00:47:56,240
Monday from fighting in
the wild with Quentin.

675
00:47:56,650 --> 00:47:58,400
So his males tree is males,

676
00:47:58,450 --> 00:48:03,450
mark the smell of an innocent young girl
and that is the smell that Benji ones

677
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:08,590
to die smelling. Um, so
he gets to smell that.

678
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:12,910
But what is also interesting is that
there's a kind of a bag with reference to

679
00:48:12,911 --> 00:48:16,840
the previous traumatic
moment, right? The smooth,

680
00:48:16,841 --> 00:48:21,841
bright shapes that we just go back
to that horrible traumatic moment.

681
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:23,473
Um,

682
00:48:23,530 --> 00:48:28,530
those are the bright whirling sheds that
were forced upon Benji at this moment

683
00:48:32,441 --> 00:48:33,670
when he's completely helpless,

684
00:48:33,671 --> 00:48:37,960
when it's pen and died down when
Katty is nowhere to be seen.

685
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:39,040
Um,

686
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:44,040
those bright whirling shapes and
this supremely traumatic moment,

687
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:51,000
those have been reconstituted
as comforting shapes that
he just doesn't know why

688
00:48:55,571 --> 00:48:56,404
they're there,

689
00:48:56,530 --> 00:49:00,040
but his falling asleep and caddy is
telling him that he's falling asleep.

690
00:49:00,090 --> 00:49:03,340
He doesn't even have
to work to talk about,

691
00:49:03,341 --> 00:49:06,790
describe the condition of
being asleep, but as, okay,

692
00:49:07,060 --> 00:49:12,060
this is really one moment where not
having language is completely okay and

693
00:49:12,911 --> 00:49:17,911
Foglar has been managed to bring
Benji back to the point with life.

694
00:49:19,300 --> 00:49:24,290
Ashley is bearable and in fact
satisfying. Um, he can talk on,

695
00:49:24,300 --> 00:49:28,720
can't really do more.
One that can really bring true happiness,

696
00:49:28,990 --> 00:49:33,990
actual objective happen is we can bring
objective happiness to Benji at 33.

697
00:49:35,740 --> 00:49:40,740
The only way you can bring is subjective
satisfaction to Benji at the age 33

698
00:49:43,030 --> 00:49:47,200
acting as if he was much younger
and still having Kelly there.

699
00:49:47,530 --> 00:49:48,910
So, um, you know,

700
00:49:48,940 --> 00:49:53,590
that the narrative experimentation
is really completely, um,

701
00:49:53,770 --> 00:49:56,920
thematically consequential as well.
Um,

702
00:49:56,921 --> 00:50:00,380
and that's really is the
story that fall in Italian.

703
00:50:00,381 --> 00:50:05,260
So we'll move on this time and
to Quentin section session too.
