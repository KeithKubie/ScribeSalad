invested in the story and what they were

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690
invested in the story and what they were
 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:51.930

cool story they have during this movie

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:53.709
cool story they have during this movie
 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:55.650
cool story they have during this movie
but for the most part the movie comes

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:55.660
but for the most part the movie comes
 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:57.030
but for the most part the movie comes
off as kind of bland and that's

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040
off as kind of bland and that's
 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:58.199
off as kind of bland and that's
unfortunately due to the fact that the

00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:58.209
unfortunately due to the fact that the
 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:00.479
