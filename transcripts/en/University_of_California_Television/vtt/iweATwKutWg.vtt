(energetic electronic music)

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:59.247
- My talk today is about
Obama, the tea party,

00:00:59.247 --> 00:01:02.820
and the future of American politics.

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.260
I think we can all recall

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.920
the tumultuous, joyful scene

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.843
in Grant Park in Chicago
on November 5th, 2008,

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:15.740
when a massive crowd

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:19.890
greeted Barack Obama,

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.780
Joe Biden, their families,

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.660
as the first African American
president of the United States

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:25.493
was elected,

00:01:25.493 --> 00:01:28.350
and one who promised change

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.850
that a very large majority
of Americans wanted

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:32.993
at that point.

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:35.960
It wasn't, oh, two weeks later

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:40.280
that Time magazine had a striking cover

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.550
on its November 24th, 2008
issue, that was called

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:49.010
The New New Deal: What Barack
Obama can learn from F.D.R.

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:51.130
It had a picture of an open

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:56.650
open convertible

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:58.590
with a grinning Barack Obama

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.490
with a fedora and a cigarette
hanging from his mouth,

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.223
Franklin Roosevelt-style.

00:02:06.327 --> 00:02:08.500
The whole theme of that magazine

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.500
was very similar to a lot of
the punditry, and the analysis,

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.600
the breathless punditry at that moment,

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.760
that we were on the verge
of a second New Deal,

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:21.090
that the Democrats and Obama
were arriving in Washington,

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.610
and were gonna change the
direction of American government,

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.860
and the youthful coalition

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:28.730
behind this youthful president

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.410
was going to relegate the Republicans

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.050
to permanent oblivion

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.053
and take the country in a new direction.

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.160
Okay, that was then, and
then, two years later,

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.853
in November, 2010,

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.240
the scene was very, very different.

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:48.330
The Republican Party was not only

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:51.010
not in oblivion,

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:52.500
it had thundered back

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.980
to one of biggest sweeping victories

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.360
in any election in the 20th century,

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:01.560
took 63 seats in the House

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.600
to take the gavel from Nancy Pelosi

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.690
and hand it to John Boehner.

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:09.160
There were big gains in the Senate

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.550
that brought the Republicans
within striking distance

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:15.350
of grabbing the majority in 2012,

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:19.180
and of course, in many
ways, even more important,

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:22.390
the huge transformations
of state house posts

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:26.210
and governorships in key states,

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:29.113
including key states like
Wisconsin and Florida,

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:31.710
Ohio,

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:33.960
that Obama would need

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:36.853
if he were to win reelection in 2012.

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:42.820
So from them on,

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:45.183
the question was, why?

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:48.160
Did Obama and the Democrats

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.900
fail to deliver the promised changes?

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.630
I see people nodding their head yes,

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:55.460
and you need to wait till
the end of the lecture

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:56.670
to argue that.

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:58.700
(audience chuckles)

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:01.850
Or did something about

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:03.740
what happened in this period

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:05.820
reenergize the Republicans,

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:10.650
and enable them to sweep around?

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:12.360
I'm gonna be suggesting, in this lecture,

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.160
that Obama actually accomplished

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.320
quite a bit of what he promised,

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:19.890
but in ways that provoked, and irritated,

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:23.460
and enraged his enemies and opponents,

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:24.950
and remained invisible,

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:29.323
and largely disappointing to his friends.

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:32.480
In any event, we can be sure

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:34.840
that whatever changes
did or did not happen

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:38.160
in that first two years
of Obama's presidency,

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:42.060
they did not lead to the
expected political payoffs

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:43.600
for Democrats.

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:47.140
So the sort of marrying
of policy redirection

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:49.700
to the building of a
new political majority

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:52.770
that had been envisaged at the time,

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:56.930
by many analysts at the
time of the 2008 election,

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:59.200
certainly did not occur.

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:03.330
So what I am going to do in
my remarks today is, first,

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:06.640
address the question of what
happened and didn't happen.

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:11.140
In other words, were there
major transformations

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:12.760
that were accomplished
in the first two years?

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:14.840
I can tell you that very
little has been accomplished

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:16.100
in the last two years,

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:20.293
so we can concentrate on 2009 and 2010,

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:23.153
and then,

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:27.933
to the degree that not as
much as might have happened,

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:31.070
is that occurred, why?

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:34.010
What were the limits on change,

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:36.970
and why did it take certain channels

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:40.760
during what I'm gonna call
Obama's halfway New Deal?

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:43.340
Secondly, what happened
to the Republican Party?

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:45.520
Because during this period,

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:49.300
we've seen the Republican
Party radicalize,

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:52.060
and that's not just me saying it.

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:53.840
According to the quantitative measures

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:55.250
that political scientists use

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:58.590
to measure the ideological
positions of parties,

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:01.640
the Republican Party has taken
the biggest leap to the right

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:05.670
in any measurement in the 20th century.

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:09.270
So we'll talk about what Obama
did and didn't accomplish,

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:13.360
why it had this kind of
effect of frustrating friends

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:15.690
and provoking and mobilizing enemies,

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:18.220
what happened with the Republican
Party, and then finally,

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:22.637
we'll end it with some
reflections on what next,

00:06:22.637 --> 00:06:25.340
and next is pretty much now.

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:29.170
We're very close to next: not entirely,

00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:31.870
but the pivot to next

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:34.203
is very closely upon us.

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:40.380
So let me start by talking
about Obama's halfway New Deal.

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:43.310
Well, why was it that so many pundits,

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:47.070
and even some analysts,
who were more sober,

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:49.530
thought that there was an opening

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:54.080
for a real redirection
of government policy,

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:56.740
and a complementary building of a politics

00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:59.513
to support it and flow from it in 2008?

00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:04.110
Well, all right, the Democrats,
for the first time, really,

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:06.360
since Clinton's election in 1992,

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:09.070
took the presidency and
both houses of Congress,

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:11.700
and did so with more
substantial majorities,

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:12.980
at least at the electoral

00:07:14.285 --> 00:07:17.410
in the presidential election for Obama.

00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:19.410
That's a rare conjuncture,

00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:22.810
and it happened because both
the House and the Senate

00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:25.530
strengthened their majorities in 2008.

00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:27.920
The campaign itself had been fought

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:29.940
with Obama being pretty clear

00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:32.550
that he wanted to change directions.

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:35.270
In foreign policy, he promised
to withdraw from Iraq.

00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:39.360
He did promise to double
down in Afghanistan,

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:42.470
so nobody can tell me that
he didn't say that; he did,

00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:44.780
but he promised to withdraw from Iraq,

00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:46.680
and he also was promising

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:51.060
to build a more bottom-up
political economy,

00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:54.930
rather than to double down
on the sort of trickle-down.

00:07:54.930 --> 00:07:56.520
He talked about taxes

00:07:56.520 --> 00:08:00.940
for the first time that
any Democrat had in eons,

00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:05.070
and actually stuck with it
when the fire got turned up,

00:08:05.070 --> 00:08:07.190
continued to insist that
he would raise taxes

00:08:07.190 --> 00:08:10.380
on people making more
that $250,000 a year.

00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:14.610
He promised, and redoubled
after he was inaugurated,

00:08:14.610 --> 00:08:18.733
to redirect health policy,
major health reform,

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:24.630
education policy, environmental
policy, and energy policy,

00:08:24.630 --> 00:08:27.543
and that's just a few of
the things he promised.

00:08:28.650 --> 00:08:31.700
This president was elected
with a youthful coalition

00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:34.240
that saw the highest
level of participation

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:37.130
since the '60s in a presidential election,

00:08:37.130 --> 00:08:40.890
with under-45-year-old
voters, minorities, women,

00:08:40.890 --> 00:08:44.677
and very much behind the president

00:08:44.677 --> 00:08:46.940
and the Democratic Party.

00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:49.300
The GOP appeared to be

00:08:50.430 --> 00:08:53.053
in total disarray after the election.

00:08:55.150 --> 00:08:57.000
Its leaders were in a state of shock.

00:08:57.970 --> 00:09:01.390
The victories that they
managed to eke out in 2008

00:09:01.390 --> 00:09:03.250
were restricted to Southern states

00:09:03.250 --> 00:09:07.593
and to the Appalachian
Chain into the Ozarks.

00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:11.840
So a lot of pundits were thinking, too,

00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:13.810
that Americans would suddenly be open

00:09:13.810 --> 00:09:15.320
to strong governmental efforts,

00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:17.960
because of course all this coincided

00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:21.630
with a financial and economic meltdown,

00:09:21.630 --> 00:09:24.010
and Americans were telling pollsters

00:09:24.010 --> 00:09:26.320
that they were more open to
the government stepping in

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:27.900
to do something.

00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:31.240
Now, I have to say that,
even at the moment,

00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:32.980
at the height of the hysteria

00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:34.580
that there would be a second New Deal,

00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:39.330
there were analysts, in my
profession of political science,

00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:41.150
such a dour profession,

00:09:41.150 --> 00:09:44.013
who were saying, wait a minute,

00:09:44.013 --> 00:09:47.220
and they were pointing to some things

00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:49.410
that I think even the White House,

00:09:49.410 --> 00:09:54.410
and probably a lot of people
in both political parties knew,

00:09:54.610 --> 00:09:57.890
which is that the 2010 election

00:09:57.890 --> 00:10:02.200
was gonna see a much less
of a turnout than 2012,

00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:06.450
that Americans

00:10:06.450 --> 00:10:09.060
will often say they want
government to do things,

00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:13.370
but are quite wary,
especially in crisis periods,

00:10:13.370 --> 00:10:16.450
when government appears
to be doing too much.

00:10:16.450 --> 00:10:18.700
So there were reasons to think

00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:21.410
that the Republicans were
gonna make more of a rebound

00:10:21.410 --> 00:10:23.920
than the Time magazine suggested,

00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:27.830
and that much of what was going to happen

00:10:27.830 --> 00:10:30.640
was going to happen quickly,
have to happen quickly,

00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:34.760
and might or might not be popular.

00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:37.270
The first months of
Obama's presidency, though,

00:10:37.270 --> 00:10:40.540
seemed to underscore

00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:42.750
the positive narrative.

00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:45.980
His popularity remained sky-high.

00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:47.150
The Democrats put through

00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:50.800
a fairly sweeping American
Recovery and Reinvestment Act,

00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:51.930
and various other laws

00:10:51.930 --> 00:10:54.750
such as the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act

00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:57.430
that had been blocked under Republicans

00:10:57.430 --> 00:10:59.053
for the previous eight years.

00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:04.510
It looked as if, possibly,

00:11:04.510 --> 00:11:06.430
the president's first budget

00:11:07.270 --> 00:11:10.480
was anything but the
usual snoozy document.

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:13.010
It reiterated the promise to move forward

00:11:13.010 --> 00:11:15.980
with comprehensive health reform
that would expand coverage

00:11:15.980 --> 00:11:17.840
to the millions who didn't have it,

00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:20.740
or were losing it in the economy.

00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:24.010
It committed to education reforms,

00:11:24.010 --> 00:11:28.550
and it committed to energy
and environmental legislation,

00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:30.923
including a version of cap-and-trade,

00:11:31.930 --> 00:11:33.960
and that's only a few things.

00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:35.770
There were many other agendas

00:11:35.770 --> 00:11:38.900
being pressed by Democrats in Congress.

00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:40.650
So it looked, for a while,

00:11:40.650 --> 00:11:44.500
as if this kind of burst of
redirection in government policy

00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:45.333
might happen,

00:11:45.333 --> 00:11:49.580
and that popularity for Obama,
if not all the Democrats,

00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:50.743
might be sustained.

00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:57.080
But it didn't take long
before things bogged down,

00:11:57.780 --> 00:12:02.640
and the popularity waned
as the economy plunged

00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:05.970
into the highest levels of unemployment,

00:12:05.970 --> 00:12:07.730
and the greatest levels of distress,

00:12:07.730 --> 00:12:09.510
particularly in the housing market,

00:12:09.510 --> 00:12:11.003
since the Great Depression.

00:12:14.170 --> 00:12:18.420
So I'd like to talk about what happened

00:12:18.420 --> 00:12:20.980
and what didn't happen after that,

00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:22.930
by invoking a comparison

00:12:22.930 --> 00:12:26.540
to the first New Deal period of the 1930s.

00:12:26.540 --> 00:12:29.060
I'm not doing that to suggest

00:12:29.060 --> 00:12:32.110
that these two periods are the same,

00:12:32.110 --> 00:12:34.580
but to use the comparison

00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:36.960
to clarify what is different

00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:40.700
about the political and
institutional context in our time,

00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:43.370
and what was different about the crises.

00:12:43.370 --> 00:12:45.310
But they do invite comparison,

00:12:45.310 --> 00:12:49.660
because these are both moments
in the 20th, 21st century,

00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:52.910
in which reform-oriented
Democratic presidents,

00:12:52.910 --> 00:12:56.130
backed by large Democratic majorities,

00:12:56.130 --> 00:12:59.300
come to Washington in a moment

00:12:59.300 --> 00:13:03.663
of massive and profound
national economic crisis.

00:13:04.730 --> 00:13:08.573
And that brings me to the
first point I wanna make.

00:13:09.570 --> 00:13:13.730
We have to ask what
kind of economic crisis,

00:13:13.730 --> 00:13:17.280
and what the timing of the downturn was

00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:21.233
in relation to the arrival
of the reformist Democrat.

00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:26.160
In the Great Depression, I'm
tempted to say you'll recall,

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:27.890
but I don't think any of us recall,

00:13:27.890 --> 00:13:30.314
but we recall from history.

00:13:30.314 --> 00:13:32.300
(audience chuckles)

00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:37.300
Roosevelt arrived three
years into the downturn.

00:13:37.410 --> 00:13:40.313
25% national unemployment.

00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:44.510
So desperate were the
businesses, the farms,

00:13:44.510 --> 00:13:47.200
the homeowners, the
workers of the country,

00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:50.890
that the bills Roosevelt sent to Congress

00:13:50.890 --> 00:13:54.350
were passed by huge bipartisan majorities

00:13:54.350 --> 00:13:56.833
even before the written texts arrived.

00:13:57.980 --> 00:14:01.143
Didn't last, but that's the
way it was the first year.

00:14:03.870 --> 00:14:05.560
Obama, by comparison,

00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:10.280
arrived just as the crisis was starting,

00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:12.690
a financial crisis.

00:14:12.690 --> 00:14:17.043
He ended up, as it were, holding
hands with Herbert Hoover.

00:14:18.230 --> 00:14:19.680
Roosevelt had been very careful

00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:21.583
not to hold hands with Herbert Hoover.

00:14:23.510 --> 00:14:25.460
Obama had little choice

00:14:25.460 --> 00:14:28.240
because he was drawn into the negotiations

00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:30.730
to prevent the Wall Street meltdown

00:14:30.730 --> 00:14:35.010
from turning into a second
worldwide Great Depression,

00:14:35.010 --> 00:14:37.010
even before he took office,

00:14:37.010 --> 00:14:39.723
and continuing after he
moved into the White House.

00:14:40.630 --> 00:14:43.520
So he didn't arrive at a moment

00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:46.810
when most Americans understood the need

00:14:46.810 --> 00:14:50.620
for massive emergency
action by government,

00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:52.690
and he certainly didn't arrive at a moment

00:14:52.690 --> 00:14:54.240
when both parties were prepared

00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:56.940
to support his emergency efforts.

00:14:56.940 --> 00:14:58.710
Furthermore, his involvement

00:14:58.710 --> 00:15:00.970
in preventing the Wall Street meltdown

00:15:00.970 --> 00:15:05.240
almost certainly influenced his
choice of economic advisors,

00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:08.990
and his choice of
Secretary of the Treasury.

00:15:08.990 --> 00:15:12.140
He picked people with ties to Wall Street.

00:15:12.140 --> 00:15:16.630
Many on the left really
think that's just awful,

00:15:16.630 --> 00:15:20.080
and maybe it is, but
it was understandable.

00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:23.160
Those were the people he
had been dealing with.

00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:25.980
Those were the people
that he probably hoped

00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:28.930
could talk these institutions
into righting the ship

00:15:28.930 --> 00:15:32.543
before it completely broke apart.

00:15:34.090 --> 00:15:38.380
So, from the point of view
of ordinary Americans,

00:15:38.380 --> 00:15:41.840
they ended up conflating the stimulus

00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:44.260
with the bailout of Wall Street,

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:46.600
thinking of them as one and the same,

00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:51.040
and the president himself
appeared to be saving the big boys

00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:54.090
while allowing all of the rest of America

00:15:54.090 --> 00:15:56.770
to suffer losses in family income

00:15:56.770 --> 00:15:58.723
and, in many cases, employment.

00:15:59.750 --> 00:16:00.943
In many ways,

00:16:02.860 --> 00:16:05.560
middle class America began to wonder,

00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:07.090
what is this all about,

00:16:07.090 --> 00:16:10.310
and is this really addressing
what we care about?

00:16:10.310 --> 00:16:13.150
Obama did not stress investments and jobs,

00:16:13.150 --> 00:16:15.610
even though many of the
investments in the Recovery Act

00:16:15.610 --> 00:16:18.513
were about creating or saving jobs.

00:16:19.900 --> 00:16:23.343
Now, the second big thing, of
course, is GOP obstruction.

00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:27.270
Unlike the Republicans
and conservative Democrats

00:16:27.270 --> 00:16:29.550
who went along with the early stages

00:16:29.550 --> 00:16:31.883
of Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal,

00:16:32.820 --> 00:16:36.983
certainly they turned against
it by '34, but the first part,

00:16:38.350 --> 00:16:41.310
Obama faced almost a solid wall

00:16:41.310 --> 00:16:44.610
of deliberate opposition
from Republican leaders

00:16:44.610 --> 00:16:47.380
from the moment he moved
into the White House.

00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:50.030
We now know that they had a dinner

00:16:50.030 --> 00:16:52.710
the night of the inauguration

00:16:52.710 --> 00:16:55.043
to set in motion this plan.

00:16:57.880 --> 00:17:02.880
It was a cold-blooded
but rational calculus

00:17:03.020 --> 00:17:05.570
on the part of the congressional leaders

00:17:05.570 --> 00:17:07.993
of the Republican Party:
McConnell and Boehner.

00:17:09.100 --> 00:17:13.120
They were dealing with a
demoralized, angry base

00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:15.480
being whipped into fear and anger

00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:19.250
by Rush Limbaugh and others
in the right-wing media,

00:17:19.250 --> 00:17:22.020
and they didn't see any percentage

00:17:22.020 --> 00:17:24.620
in cooperating with efforts

00:17:24.620 --> 00:17:27.480
to limit the economic downturn,

00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:31.550
because they didn't think they'd
get credit for cooperation,

00:17:31.550 --> 00:17:34.710
and they thought if the
economy turned up quickly,

00:17:34.710 --> 00:17:37.520
that would merely help
to reelect a president

00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:40.023
that they very much wanted to displace.

00:17:41.310 --> 00:17:46.310
Obama was slow to recognize,
I think it's fair to say,

00:17:46.580 --> 00:17:50.483
that he wasn't getting any
cooperation from these folks,

00:17:51.590 --> 00:17:54.670
but it's empirically
obvious from the record.

00:17:54.670 --> 00:17:56.970
The stimulus was cut back,

00:17:56.970 --> 00:17:58.730
and barely eked through

00:17:58.730 --> 00:18:03.310
after a few of what counted at that time

00:18:03.310 --> 00:18:05.360
as moderate Republicans

00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:09.480
were allowed to take much of the spending

00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:10.890
out of the measure,

00:18:10.890 --> 00:18:13.150
and place more emphasis on tax cuts,

00:18:13.150 --> 00:18:15.313
which are not as stimulative of growth.

00:18:19.581 --> 00:18:21.650
And we know, we all know,

00:18:21.650 --> 00:18:24.280
that the long battle for
the Affordable Care Act,

00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:28.460
which passed only 15 months
into Obama's presidency,

00:18:28.460 --> 00:18:30.800
was greatly slowed down

00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:34.160
by the willingness of
Republican leaders in the Senate

00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:39.110
to crack the whip, and
impede every single move,

00:18:39.110 --> 00:18:41.880
on every appointment,
every legislative step,

00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:44.130
about that bill and everything else,

00:18:44.130 --> 00:18:47.010
grinding the Senate to a virtual halt

00:18:47.010 --> 00:18:50.243
during and after that struggle.

00:18:51.940 --> 00:18:54.350
So that's a second difference.

00:18:54.350 --> 00:18:57.840
Now, another difference
from the '30s would be,

00:18:57.840 --> 00:18:59.480
not so much that there

00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:00.510
there were conflicts

00:19:00.510 --> 00:19:03.020
between conservatives and
liberals in the 1930s,

00:19:03.020 --> 00:19:06.480
and much of the rhetoric
of politics in the 1930s

00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:10.080
was just as, shall we say,

00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:12.190
unlimited in its

00:19:14.610 --> 00:19:17.710
demonization of the opponent

00:19:17.710 --> 00:19:20.780
as anything we hear now.

00:19:20.780 --> 00:19:22.680
There's nothing about American politics

00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:24.360
that's really a tea party,

00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:27.830
if I can say so in that tea party sense,

00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:29.030
the old tea party sense.

00:19:30.270 --> 00:19:31.643
It's a contact sport,

00:19:32.870 --> 00:19:35.110
and there's a lot of vituperation

00:19:35.110 --> 00:19:39.440
in periods of mobilization and crisis.

00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:41.140
But the difference in the 1930s

00:19:41.140 --> 00:19:43.280
was that ideological polarization

00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:46.133
and partisan polarization
did not perfectly line up.

00:19:47.810 --> 00:19:51.360
There were moderate to
liberal Republicans,

00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:53.140
who went along with parts of the New Deal.

00:19:53.140 --> 00:19:54.840
There were certainly a conservative bloc

00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:55.760
in the Democratic Party,

00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:57.320
which ended up being the arbiter

00:19:57.320 --> 00:20:01.080
of how far things like labor law reform,

00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:02.740
or the shape of Social Security,

00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:06.510
how many groups it included
in the society, went.

00:20:06.510 --> 00:20:08.380
And you might say, well, what
difference does that make?

00:20:08.380 --> 00:20:10.680
There's polarization in both cases,

00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:11.940
between conservatives and liberals,

00:20:11.940 --> 00:20:15.050
but what I would argue
that in the Obama period,

00:20:15.050 --> 00:20:17.200
by the time he had
already arrived in office,

00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:19.010
this had already happened,

00:20:19.010 --> 00:20:21.550
the sharp polarization

00:20:21.550 --> 00:20:24.320
that lines up conservatives
with Republicans,

00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:26.800
and liberals and moderates with Democrats,

00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:29.910
was so extreme already,

00:20:29.910 --> 00:20:34.057
that that gave party leaders
in the Republican Party

00:20:34.057 --> 00:20:37.890
a more effective means

00:20:37.890 --> 00:20:40.240
for disciplining their cohorts,

00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:42.080
who were like-minded,

00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:43.950
and more of an ability

00:20:43.950 --> 00:20:47.030
to line up a message of opposition

00:20:47.030 --> 00:20:49.310
that is highly ideological,

00:20:49.310 --> 00:20:52.340
with the wielding of congressional power.

00:20:52.340 --> 00:20:53.550
So it does matter.

00:20:53.550 --> 00:20:56.570
It also matters, given the
norms of parts of the media,

00:20:56.570 --> 00:20:58.240
which will always give equal time

00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:00.250
to Democrats and Republicans,

00:21:00.250 --> 00:21:02.370
and so the message that would be heard,

00:21:02.370 --> 00:21:03.950
especially from the Republican side,

00:21:03.950 --> 00:21:07.680
would be consistent in
certain ideological terms,

00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:08.883
in our period.

00:21:09.900 --> 00:21:12.270
Now, that brings me into another
factor that really matters,

00:21:12.270 --> 00:21:14.860
and that's the structure of our media,

00:21:14.860 --> 00:21:17.800
of mass media, of communications.

00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:20.724
Both Franklin Roosevelt and Barack Obama

00:21:20.724 --> 00:21:25.073
were innovators in
presidential communication.

00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:27.370
Franklin Roosevelt

00:21:27.370 --> 00:21:31.490
was famous for his radio chats
with the American people,

00:21:31.490 --> 00:21:32.950
fireside chats,

00:21:32.950 --> 00:21:36.480
in which he hopped over
the newspaper editors,

00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:38.360
who were mostly opposed to him,

00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:41.300
and got right into people's
homes through the radio.

00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:44.150
Obama, as you know, does these weekly

00:21:45.350 --> 00:21:49.010
Internet video chats

00:21:49.010 --> 00:21:49.843
that are pretty good.

00:21:49.843 --> 00:21:51.120
They get to a lot of people

00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:54.940
and allow him to bypass the scrum

00:21:54.940 --> 00:21:58.930
that would take the message
in another direction.

00:21:58.930 --> 00:22:00.590
But that's where the similarity ends,

00:22:00.590 --> 00:22:04.293
because by the time you get to our era,

00:22:06.537 --> 00:22:09.340
the 20th century norms of balance,

00:22:09.340 --> 00:22:13.810
in which newspapers, and
television outlets after the '60s,

00:22:15.090 --> 00:22:18.090
kind of say, well, there's
two sides to every story.

00:22:18.090 --> 00:22:20.240
Actually, it's not just
two sides to every story,

00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:23.790
but that's what they've
said for many decades:

00:22:23.790 --> 00:22:25.110
there are two sides to everybody's story,

00:22:25.110 --> 00:22:27.210
so we're gonna have one
Democrat and one Republican

00:22:27.210 --> 00:22:28.170
to tell those stories,

00:22:28.170 --> 00:22:31.740
or one pro and one con
to tell those stories.

00:22:31.740 --> 00:22:34.470
Well, we still have parts of our media,

00:22:34.470 --> 00:22:38.760
some newspapers, to the degree
that they're hobbling on,

00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:40.620
in economic circumstances,

00:22:40.620 --> 00:22:44.650
some television networks

00:22:44.650 --> 00:22:46.690
that try for that,

00:22:46.690 --> 00:22:50.780
but we also have the growth
of a right-wing media sector

00:22:50.780 --> 00:22:52.280
around Fox News

00:22:53.150 --> 00:22:57.900
that is much more like 19th
century American politics.

00:22:57.900 --> 00:23:01.050
In 19th century American politics,

00:23:01.050 --> 00:23:04.000
media outlets were overtly aligned

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:05.750
with one political party or the other,

00:23:05.750 --> 00:23:09.540
and frankly presented a
combination of propaganda and news.

00:23:09.540 --> 00:23:11.410
Everybody knew they were.

00:23:11.410 --> 00:23:12.673
That's the way it worked.

00:23:13.510 --> 00:23:16.970
So now what we have is frank propaganda

00:23:16.970 --> 00:23:19.460
combined with information,
or disinformation,

00:23:19.460 --> 00:23:21.440
in the Fox Network,

00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:25.580
which is reinforced by a
network of radio talk hosts

00:23:25.580 --> 00:23:28.253
around the country that
echo those messages.

00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:32.960
That, coexisting with
economically-stressed,

00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:36.540
increasingly fragmented media outlets,

00:23:36.540 --> 00:23:40.350
some of them Internet,
some of them newspapers,

00:23:40.350 --> 00:23:43.720
that are still trying to do a
little bit of this and that.

00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:46.320
That combination of 19th century media

00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:50.950
and 20th century
institutions under stress,

00:23:50.950 --> 00:23:53.080
and increasingly fragmented,

00:23:53.080 --> 00:23:54.470
leads to a situation

00:23:54.470 --> 00:23:57.700
in which the right-wing
can set the agenda.

00:23:57.700 --> 00:23:59.300
Time and time again,

00:23:59.300 --> 00:24:03.900
Fox and the talk radio people

00:24:03.900 --> 00:24:07.380
raise some accusation or scandal,

00:24:07.380 --> 00:24:10.360
and the rest of the media
spends time discussing it.

00:24:10.360 --> 00:24:12.230
The New York Times
always waits a few days,

00:24:12.230 --> 00:24:14.180
and then has an article about how,

00:24:14.180 --> 00:24:17.479
what are we, sort of meta?

00:24:17.479 --> 00:24:18.430
(audience chuckles)

00:24:18.430 --> 00:24:23.430
But should we really be talking
about death panels, I mean,

00:24:23.660 --> 00:24:25.640
in the health care act?

00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:29.830
Now, my point would be that
that makes it very difficult

00:24:29.830 --> 00:24:33.230
for a government official,

00:24:33.230 --> 00:24:35.010
president, Congress,

00:24:35.010 --> 00:24:39.140
who are trying to promote
fairly complicated changes,

00:24:39.140 --> 00:24:42.980
to even get an explanation
of what they're trying to do

00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:45.310
through the hubbub,

00:24:45.310 --> 00:24:46.640
and all the more so

00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:50.530
because the citizens are
partly aligning themselves

00:24:50.530 --> 00:24:53.200
by age group and by
partisan identification,

00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:55.650
with different sets of media outlets,

00:24:55.650 --> 00:24:58.240
so that people aren't even
hearing the same facts

00:24:58.240 --> 00:25:00.433
or the same realities at all.

00:25:02.070 --> 00:25:04.030
Now, that brings me to
the final big difference

00:25:04.030 --> 00:25:08.530
I wanna draw between FDR and Obama,

00:25:08.530 --> 00:25:11.710
between the first New Deal and
the attempt at a second one,

00:25:11.710 --> 00:25:15.000
and that is there's a huge difference

00:25:16.130 --> 00:25:18.850
between trying to expand

00:25:18.850 --> 00:25:23.120
federal government
interventions and benefits

00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:25.610
into new sectors of
social and economic life

00:25:25.610 --> 00:25:28.433
for the first time in peacetime,

00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:31.860
and trying to remake

00:25:31.860 --> 00:25:36.570
already deeply-entrenched
sets of regulations,

00:25:36.570 --> 00:25:40.890
benefits, taxes, and tax credits.

00:25:40.890 --> 00:25:42.890
When Roosevelt and the New Dealers

00:25:42.890 --> 00:25:45.510
were putting in place Social Security,

00:25:45.510 --> 00:25:47.630
some of the first labor laws,

00:25:47.630 --> 00:25:50.210
some of the first financial regulations,

00:25:50.210 --> 00:25:52.290
there was certainly intense argument

00:25:52.290 --> 00:25:54.260
about whether it should be done,

00:25:54.260 --> 00:25:57.950
but people had an idea that
something was happening,

00:25:57.950 --> 00:25:59.400
that something new was happening,

00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:01.380
and some sense of what it was,

00:26:01.380 --> 00:26:03.400
and that was true both
among the opponents,

00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:07.653
and among the proponents, and
the possible beneficiaries.

00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:12.133
Now, Obama arrives in 2008.

00:26:13.080 --> 00:26:16.270
He is proposing

00:26:16.270 --> 00:26:21.270
to move social policy

00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:23.400
and tax policy

00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:26.190
in a somewhat more middle-class

00:26:26.190 --> 00:26:29.460
and lower-income-friendly direction,

00:26:29.460 --> 00:26:32.470
and to make it a little bit less tilted

00:26:32.470 --> 00:26:35.490
toward business and the very wealthy,

00:26:35.490 --> 00:26:37.600
but he's proposing to do that

00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:40.720
in an era of tight fiscal constraints,

00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:45.703
with a budget very much out
of balance before he arrived,

00:26:47.486 --> 00:26:49.491
after the Bush wars

00:26:49.491 --> 00:26:52.460
and social policy measures

00:26:52.460 --> 00:26:57.360
had busted the deficit
picture for the long run,

00:26:57.360 --> 00:27:00.220
and he is proposing to change things

00:27:00.220 --> 00:27:02.960
that are already embedded

00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:05.950
in the life of business sectors,

00:27:05.950 --> 00:27:09.000
and in the lives of
families and communities,

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:11.123
but often in ways they don't see.

00:27:12.260 --> 00:27:16.230
So for example, in higher education loans,

00:27:16.230 --> 00:27:20.910
Obama set to work to
remove subsidies from banks

00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:24.130
that they were using to channel loans

00:27:24.130 --> 00:27:27.393
through college financial aid offices,

00:27:28.290 --> 00:27:30.320
recapture some of those resources

00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:33.300
to expand the Pell Grants
for low-income students,

00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:36.040
and make more loans to
middle-class families

00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:38.610
at a lower expense to
the federal government.

00:27:38.610 --> 00:27:42.770
Sounds logical, but in
a situation like that,

00:27:42.770 --> 00:27:45.620
which was repeated, by the
way, in the health-care arena,

00:27:46.840 --> 00:27:50.840
a very complicated public-private
health-care system,

00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:52.700
in which Obama was going to retrieve

00:27:52.700 --> 00:27:56.660
some resources committed
to Medicare and Medicaid,

00:27:56.660 --> 00:27:59.780
some of the subsidies
being given to hospitals,

00:27:59.780 --> 00:28:03.610
pharmaceutical companies,
medical devices manufacturers,

00:28:03.610 --> 00:28:05.790
and unionized workers,

00:28:05.790 --> 00:28:08.640
and take those resources

00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:12.380
and redirect them to the
expansion of coverage

00:28:12.380 --> 00:28:15.363
for low and lower-middle-income people.

00:28:16.210 --> 00:28:17.993
In both of those cases,

00:28:18.970 --> 00:28:21.853
the people whose toes were
going to be stepped on,

00:28:23.010 --> 00:28:25.690
the businesses that were going to lose

00:28:25.690 --> 00:28:29.780
regulated profit
opportunities or subsidies,

00:28:29.780 --> 00:28:30.960
the wealthy people

00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:34.263
who were gonna be asked to
pay a smidgen more in taxes,

00:28:35.690 --> 00:28:38.040
the Medicare, wealthy Medicare people

00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:40.800
who might have to pay a little bit more,

00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:43.280
as you will recall, the unions,

00:28:43.280 --> 00:28:45.260
whose workers might have to take

00:28:45.260 --> 00:28:48.350
a little bit less generous tax subsidy

00:28:48.350 --> 00:28:50.360
for 10 years from now

00:28:50.360 --> 00:28:52.210
in their health benefits.

00:28:52.210 --> 00:28:54.770
So this is not really just partisan.

00:28:54.770 --> 00:28:58.510
All the players with
the embedded advantages

00:28:58.510 --> 00:29:01.180
knew their toes were being stepped on,

00:29:01.180 --> 00:29:04.373
and could mobilize
instantly in opposition.

00:29:05.970 --> 00:29:10.540
But many of the beneficiaries

00:29:10.540 --> 00:29:12.983
couldn't see what they would get,

00:29:14.130 --> 00:29:17.790
either because the
transformations were occurring

00:29:17.790 --> 00:29:19.960
in things they didn't even
know they were getting

00:29:19.960 --> 00:29:21.810
in the first place.

00:29:21.810 --> 00:29:23.160
There's a lot good research now

00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:24.790
that shows that Pell Grant recipients

00:29:24.790 --> 00:29:27.040
don't even know they're
getting a Pell Grant,

00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:33.380
whereas GI benefits after World War II,

00:29:33.380 --> 00:29:34.563
every GI knew,

00:29:37.016 --> 00:29:39.530
and that's a direct benefit,

00:29:39.530 --> 00:29:42.980
but it's so embedded in
the layers of tax credits,

00:29:42.980 --> 00:29:47.200
and loan subsidies, and
letters that nobody can read,

00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:50.550
that aren't in English,
that they don't know.

00:29:50.550 --> 00:29:53.190
And certainly, large numbers of people

00:29:53.190 --> 00:29:55.300
who were going to be beneficiaries

00:29:55.300 --> 00:29:56.670
of the Affordable Care Act,

00:29:56.670 --> 00:29:58.710
the 30 million who were going to get

00:29:58.710 --> 00:30:02.100
expanded, affordable health
coverage through Medicaid,

00:30:02.100 --> 00:30:04.890
or through subsidies on the
health insurance exchanges,

00:30:04.890 --> 00:30:07.763
they didn't know what
they were going to get.

00:30:09.250 --> 00:30:12.690
So there's a huge difference

00:30:12.690 --> 00:30:14.250
between putting into place

00:30:14.250 --> 00:30:16.950
fairly clear, direct government benefits

00:30:16.950 --> 00:30:18.660
and regulations in the first place,

00:30:18.660 --> 00:30:23.060
and trying to rework a
forest of regulations,

00:30:23.060 --> 00:30:24.320
subsidies, and benefits,

00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:29.220
that include many invisible tax credits

00:30:29.220 --> 00:30:33.350
and subsidies for businesses
to deliver things,

00:30:33.350 --> 00:30:37.230
or non-profits to deliver
things to people indirectly.

00:30:37.230 --> 00:30:38.280
There's a huge difference,

00:30:38.280 --> 00:30:41.590
and Obama, in many ways,
has paid the price,

00:30:41.590 --> 00:30:43.920
because his enemies knew,

00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:46.890
and his friends still
don't know, in many cases,

00:30:46.890 --> 00:30:51.133
what they stand to get, or
what they have already gotten.

00:30:53.370 --> 00:30:55.750
Now, that brings me to what
I wanna talk about next,

00:30:55.750 --> 00:30:58.263
which is the tea party
and the Republican Party.

00:30:59.750 --> 00:31:01.760
I've talked about all
this stuff about Obama,

00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:04.400
but in the long run of history,

00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:06.380
people may look back
at this period and say,

00:31:06.380 --> 00:31:09.620
the real story here was not the Democrats,

00:31:09.620 --> 00:31:13.000
not their attempts to
change things in Washington,

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:16.700
but the radicalization
and the mobilization

00:31:16.700 --> 00:31:19.140
of the Republican Party.

00:31:19.140 --> 00:31:20.160
It's certainly not

00:31:20.160 --> 00:31:23.250
Dwight Eisenhower's
Republican Party anymore.

00:31:23.250 --> 00:31:25.930
It's not Richard Nixon's Republican Party.

00:31:25.930 --> 00:31:29.320
It's not even John
McCain's Republican Party,

00:31:29.320 --> 00:31:30.153
because remember,

00:31:30.153 --> 00:31:34.333
in 2008 John McCain said global
warming was a serious issue,

00:31:36.440 --> 00:31:38.070
sorta advocated cap-and-trade,

00:31:38.070 --> 00:31:40.283
he was a little vague on that,

00:31:41.250 --> 00:31:45.160
and he certainly reiterated
that Republicans, too,

00:31:45.160 --> 00:31:46.940
wanted to get health
insurance to everyone,

00:31:46.940 --> 00:31:49.443
it's just that they had a
different way of doing it.

00:31:50.570 --> 00:31:54.763
That's not where we are now
with the Republican Party.

00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:01.000
There has been a documentable
leap to the right

00:32:01.190 --> 00:32:04.170
in what party leaders,
candidates, and officeholders

00:32:04.170 --> 00:32:07.040
are prepared to say about
all of these issues,

00:32:07.040 --> 00:32:08.490
and in the quantitative measures

00:32:08.490 --> 00:32:09.620
that political scientists use

00:32:09.620 --> 00:32:11.813
to measure their voting behavior.

00:32:12.770 --> 00:32:14.000
So what happened?

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:15.680
In many ways, this was a period

00:32:15.680 --> 00:32:19.300
in which the cold-blooded
leadership calculation,

00:32:19.300 --> 00:32:22.910
that's nevertheless rational,
that I described in 2009,

00:32:22.910 --> 00:32:25.480
that the Republican
leaders in Congress took,

00:32:25.480 --> 00:32:29.180
to oppose Obama and hope for
the best in the next election,

00:32:29.180 --> 00:32:31.870
that was reinforced by the eruption

00:32:31.870 --> 00:32:34.580
and the pincer movement of the tea party.

00:32:34.580 --> 00:32:35.980
Now, what do I mean by that?

00:32:36.910 --> 00:32:41.350
It was just a few weeks
into Obama's presidency

00:32:41.350 --> 00:32:46.190
when a rant, as it came to
be called, occurred on CNBC.

00:32:46.190 --> 00:32:49.130
Rick Santelli, a financial commentator,

00:32:49.130 --> 00:32:52.640
went into an emotional rant
in his television program,

00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:55.620
invoking the founding
fathers, including Jefferson.

00:32:55.620 --> 00:32:56.740
Is there a bust of Jefferson?

00:32:56.740 --> 00:32:57.573
No.

00:32:59.977 --> 00:33:02.680
To condemn mortgage assistance

00:33:03.800 --> 00:33:08.020
being put out by the Obama
administration to losers,

00:33:08.020 --> 00:33:12.570
neighbors that were freeloading

00:33:12.570 --> 00:33:13.760
on the real Americans,

00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:16.870
and he called for tea party protests,

00:33:16.870 --> 00:33:20.850
and within weeks there were
regional demonstrations

00:33:20.850 --> 00:33:24.720
cheered on by Fox News and
right-wing radio commentators,

00:33:24.720 --> 00:33:28.230
and we saw older people carrying signs

00:33:28.230 --> 00:33:32.850
denouncing Obama as a
communist, a socialist,

00:33:32.850 --> 00:33:35.739
a Nazi, all at once.

00:33:35.739 --> 00:33:36.650
(audience chuckling)

00:33:36.650 --> 00:33:40.543
It's almost as if the pact
had returned temporarily.

00:33:41.860 --> 00:33:46.020
And within weeks after that,

00:33:46.020 --> 00:33:49.700
by late spring and through
the summer of 2009,

00:33:49.700 --> 00:33:51.550
while the regional
demonstrations were going on,

00:33:51.550 --> 00:33:54.440
and building to the big one in Washington

00:33:55.960 --> 00:33:59.060
that was held in September
of 2009 for the first time,

00:33:59.060 --> 00:34:01.060
tea partiers were taking
another step which,

00:34:01.060 --> 00:34:03.200
to a student of American
civic life like myself,

00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:05.100
is quite extraordinary.

00:34:05.100 --> 00:34:07.520
Across the country,
they started organizing,

00:34:07.520 --> 00:34:10.560
regularly meeting local tea parties

00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:12.763
that met once a week, or once a month.

00:34:14.100 --> 00:34:17.300
In our book, Vanessa
Williamson and I have a map

00:34:17.300 --> 00:34:21.770
showing that they were all
across the United States.

00:34:21.770 --> 00:34:22.603
They were put together

00:34:22.603 --> 00:34:24.970
by people who often met each
other for the first time

00:34:24.970 --> 00:34:26.510
during some of the protests,

00:34:26.510 --> 00:34:30.740
and they were quite an
achievement in this era,

00:34:30.740 --> 00:34:34.310
where locally-meeting
citizens groups rarely happen,

00:34:34.310 --> 00:34:37.810
and are not usually newly created.

00:34:37.810 --> 00:34:39.220
By 2010,

00:34:39.220 --> 00:34:43.690
tea partiers were beginning
to influence elections.

00:34:43.690 --> 00:34:48.120
They were credited with part
of the Scott Brown victory

00:34:49.120 --> 00:34:50.130
in Massachusetts,

00:34:50.130 --> 00:34:55.130
which really sent a cannon
shot through Washington DC,

00:34:55.772 --> 00:35:00.080
and they were certainly
responsible for, say, Crist being,

00:35:00.080 --> 00:35:01.560
the moderate Republican Crist,

00:35:01.560 --> 00:35:02.850
being defeated in Florida,

00:35:02.850 --> 00:35:07.650
and Marco Rubio displacing
him in the Republican ticket.

00:35:07.650 --> 00:35:09.860
They went on, during the course of 2009,

00:35:09.860 --> 00:35:13.000
to influence quite a few substitutions

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:15.730
of very, very conservative Republicans,

00:35:15.730 --> 00:35:19.240
for merely very conservative Republicans,

00:35:19.240 --> 00:35:22.390
and were credited with a lot of the energy

00:35:22.390 --> 00:35:24.660
that helped the sweep of the Republicans

00:35:24.660 --> 00:35:26.933
that I described earlier,
in November, 2010.

00:35:31.250 --> 00:35:35.040
Now, one of my graduate students,
Vanessa Williamson, and I

00:35:35.040 --> 00:35:37.780
were working on other projects
as all this began to unfold.

00:35:37.780 --> 00:35:40.290
I was working on the Obama presidency,

00:35:40.290 --> 00:35:43.630
and we obviously noticed
something is happening here,

00:35:43.630 --> 00:35:46.250
and we were very interested
to figure out what it was.

00:35:46.250 --> 00:35:48.360
So we set out to do the research

00:35:48.360 --> 00:35:50.010
that's been published
in the tea party book,

00:35:50.010 --> 00:35:55.010
and we threw every possible
research method at it.

00:35:55.040 --> 00:35:57.350
We collected all the surveys

00:35:57.350 --> 00:35:59.890
that asked who tea partiers
were, what they thought,

00:35:59.890 --> 00:36:01.230
what other Americans thought of them,

00:36:01.230 --> 00:36:03.530
and arrayed them over time.

00:36:03.530 --> 00:36:07.010
We studied media coverage
of the tea party,

00:36:07.010 --> 00:36:09.140
Fox News and CNN.

00:36:09.140 --> 00:36:13.290
We pulled together electoral statistics,

00:36:13.290 --> 00:36:16.260
and we commissioned a
couple of undergraduates

00:36:16.260 --> 00:36:17.830
to help us put together a database

00:36:17.830 --> 00:36:21.430
of the 900 tea parties around the country,

00:36:21.430 --> 00:36:24.600
by studying their websites,
so we know where they are

00:36:24.600 --> 00:36:27.030
and what they're saying on their websites.

00:36:27.030 --> 00:36:29.680
But we also wanted to take another step.

00:36:29.680 --> 00:36:32.423
We wanted to talk to tea partiers.

00:36:33.330 --> 00:36:36.570
Now, that was a new one for me

00:36:36.570 --> 00:36:37.670
(audience chuckles)

00:36:37.670 --> 00:36:39.460
I've talked to policymakers,

00:36:39.460 --> 00:36:41.740
but I've never talked
to grassroots actors,

00:36:41.740 --> 00:36:46.474
particularly those who think
that professors are demons.

00:36:46.474 --> 00:36:47.731
(audience laughs)

00:36:47.731 --> 00:36:50.710
And I can tell you that in tea party land,

00:36:50.710 --> 00:36:54.533
Harvard professors are pretty bad,

00:36:55.427 --> 00:36:56.883
pretty high on the list,

00:36:57.820 --> 00:37:02.300
and it doesn't take much
clicking around on the Web

00:37:02.300 --> 00:37:06.219
to find out that I'm a
known New Deal liberal.

00:37:06.219 --> 00:37:07.052
(audience chuckles)

00:37:07.052 --> 00:37:08.970
I mean, you know.

00:37:08.970 --> 00:37:10.840
One tea partier

00:37:10.840 --> 00:37:13.700
that we were set to visit
her tea party in Minnesota.

00:37:13.700 --> 00:37:16.370
We'd gotten the governor,

00:37:16.370 --> 00:37:21.210
or the Republican who ran for
governor unsuccessfully on the

00:37:21.210 --> 00:37:22.230
with tea party support,

00:37:22.230 --> 00:37:24.340
he had arranged for us
to visit a tea party

00:37:24.340 --> 00:37:26.210
outside of Minneapolis.

00:37:26.210 --> 00:37:30.530
We were all set to go when
she clicked on her website

00:37:32.305 --> 00:37:34.010
on her computer one Saturday afternoon,

00:37:34.010 --> 00:37:36.540
and discovered who Theda Skocpol was,

00:37:36.540 --> 00:37:39.070
and it tells you something
about local tea partiers

00:37:39.070 --> 00:37:41.770
that she immediately
canceled the engagement.

00:37:41.770 --> 00:37:44.480
It didn't matter that elites in her state

00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:46.890
thought she should cooperate.

00:37:46.890 --> 00:37:48.560
She wasn't about to do that when she

00:37:48.560 --> 00:37:51.623
She wrote me an email, said,
your views are not ours.

00:37:52.490 --> 00:37:53.640
Don't come.

00:37:53.640 --> 00:37:55.100
Well, we didn't go.

00:37:55.100 --> 00:37:57.180
But we did go to visit

00:37:57.180 --> 00:38:00.950
and observe local tea parties
in several parts of Virginia,

00:38:00.950 --> 00:38:04.590
several parts of New England, and Arizona,

00:38:04.590 --> 00:38:07.120
and when tea partiers

00:38:07.120 --> 00:38:09.980
would allow us to come,

00:38:09.980 --> 00:38:11.567
I mean these are public
meetings, so you can go,

00:38:11.567 --> 00:38:13.940
and I went to one of them incognito.

00:38:13.940 --> 00:38:16.960
I'll tell you about it
in the question period.

00:38:16.960 --> 00:38:19.500
But we usually asked,

00:38:19.500 --> 00:38:23.020
and when they allowed us to come,

00:38:23.020 --> 00:38:26.120
and when they allowed, agreed,
a certain proportion of them,

00:38:26.120 --> 00:38:28.460
to sit down with us for
one-on-one, personal,

00:38:28.460 --> 00:38:32.610
confidential interviews, they
were utterly gracious to us.

00:38:32.610 --> 00:38:37.183
We, of course, put aside our Harvard-ness

00:38:37.183 --> 00:38:38.140
(audience chuckles)

00:38:38.140 --> 00:38:42.690
for the occasion, and showed
respect to our fellow citizens,

00:38:42.690 --> 00:38:44.370
and that wasn't hard to do,

00:38:44.370 --> 00:38:46.550
because the people we were interviewing

00:38:46.550 --> 00:38:48.460
were devoted citizens.

00:38:48.460 --> 00:38:52.400
They had organized volunteer meetings.

00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:53.830
They threw in their own money.

00:38:53.830 --> 00:38:57.030
Tea parties do not receive
checks from the Koch brothers.

00:38:57.030 --> 00:39:00.730
They are run like Methodist
church gatherings,

00:39:00.730 --> 00:39:04.170
in which ladies sell baked goods,

00:39:04.170 --> 00:39:06.470
and people put money in a basket,

00:39:06.470 --> 00:39:10.420
or they sell things like
beautiful tea party pins.

00:39:10.420 --> 00:39:12.570
I should have brought my tea party pin.

00:39:12.570 --> 00:39:16.657
Or biographies of Sarah
Palin, for a proportion of the

00:39:16.657 --> 00:39:18.030
The tea party pins are lovely.

00:39:18.030 --> 00:39:19.500
They're made in China.

00:39:19.500 --> 00:39:21.000
(audience chuckles)

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:22.850
But that's how they raise money.

00:39:22.850 --> 00:39:26.550
So anyway, we visited these places,

00:39:26.550 --> 00:39:27.850
and interviewed people individually,

00:39:27.850 --> 00:39:28.870
and here's what we found out

00:39:28.870 --> 00:39:30.340
by putting together our interviews

00:39:30.340 --> 00:39:33.750
with the survey research
and the other resources.

00:39:33.750 --> 00:39:38.533
Tea partiers are all older white
conservative-minded people.

00:39:39.480 --> 00:39:42.730
They always vote for
Republicans against Democrats,

00:39:42.730 --> 00:39:44.520
but they are suspicious

00:39:44.520 --> 00:39:48.450
of the established Republican leadership,

00:39:48.450 --> 00:39:52.517
officeholders, and Karl
Rove, for that matter.

00:39:55.730 --> 00:39:58.660
They feel very strongly

00:39:58.660 --> 00:40:01.100
against regulation and spending,

00:40:01.100 --> 00:40:05.670
but when you sit down and
talk with them one-on-one,

00:40:05.670 --> 00:40:07.260
you get a more nuanced view

00:40:07.260 --> 00:40:10.440
than you're gonna get out
of any national survey.

00:40:10.440 --> 00:40:12.600
We, for example, were curious

00:40:12.600 --> 00:40:14.500
what they thought about
government regulation,

00:40:14.500 --> 00:40:16.660
and we had people whispering in our ear

00:40:16.660 --> 00:40:19.150
to find out if they
were against Wall Street

00:40:19.150 --> 00:40:21.540
and willing to regulate business abuses.

00:40:21.540 --> 00:40:22.410
Well, I can report to you

00:40:22.410 --> 00:40:25.220
that we never heard a single
tea partier criticize business

00:40:25.220 --> 00:40:26.750
in any way whatsoever,

00:40:26.750 --> 00:40:28.500
and although they didn't like the bailout,

00:40:28.500 --> 00:40:30.750
they blamed the politicians,
not Wall Street.

00:40:33.030 --> 00:40:34.300
When it comes to regulation,

00:40:34.300 --> 00:40:37.020
they're completely opposed to
any regulation of business,

00:40:37.020 --> 00:40:40.500
or any regulation of
private property homeowners,

00:40:40.500 --> 00:40:43.260
but they are very much in favor

00:40:43.260 --> 00:40:45.880
of cracking down on immigrants.

00:40:45.880 --> 00:40:48.570
All tea partiers in all
parts of the country believe

00:40:48.570 --> 00:40:51.810
the United States is being
overrun by illegal immigrants

00:40:51.810 --> 00:40:55.220
who are crowding into our
emergency rooms and our schools,

00:40:55.220 --> 00:40:58.440
and taking taxpayer-funded resources

00:40:58.440 --> 00:41:00.210
that they don't have a right to,

00:41:00.210 --> 00:41:03.650
and they want the toughest
possible enforcement,

00:41:03.650 --> 00:41:05.660
at the border and in their communities,

00:41:05.660 --> 00:41:08.483
against immigrants who are not documented.

00:41:09.810 --> 00:41:13.590
About half of tea partiers are
also Christian conservatives,

00:41:13.590 --> 00:41:15.110
and they wanna crack down

00:41:15.110 --> 00:41:19.623
on homosexuals, abortion,
and family behavior.

00:41:21.370 --> 00:41:22.690
What about spending?

00:41:22.690 --> 00:41:25.100
Now, I will admit that Vanessa and I,

00:41:25.100 --> 00:41:26.633
going into this research,

00:41:27.890 --> 00:41:31.887
were skeptical that a lot of older people,

00:41:31.887 --> 00:41:34.410
and most tea partiers, I fit right in,

00:41:34.410 --> 00:41:38.920
most tea partiers are 45
and above, almost all,

00:41:38.920 --> 00:41:41.050
and most are 55, or 60, or above,

00:41:41.050 --> 00:41:43.360
and when you go to a tea party meeting,

00:41:43.360 --> 00:41:47.400
you arrive there and there
are big, Buick-like cars

00:41:47.400 --> 00:41:51.070
with bumper stickers

00:41:51.070 --> 00:41:53.870
like, Redistribute My Work Ethic,

00:41:53.870 --> 00:41:57.240
Keep Working: Millions
on Welfare Depend on You,

00:41:57.240 --> 00:42:01.730
things like that, or ones attacking Obama,

00:42:01.730 --> 00:42:04.720
and they are older couples, men and women,

00:42:04.720 --> 00:42:07.900
who are attending these meetings
together, in most cases.

00:42:07.900 --> 00:42:12.350
And so we were skeptical that
that demographic, if you will,

00:42:12.350 --> 00:42:14.810
was completely against
government spending.

00:42:14.810 --> 00:42:19.288
I mean, they're on
Social Security (laughs)

00:42:19.288 --> 00:42:20.260
(audience laughs)

00:42:20.260 --> 00:42:23.880
They're on Medicare, and they
are on veterans benefits,

00:42:23.880 --> 00:42:26.230
and they know those are
government benefits.

00:42:26.230 --> 00:42:28.060
Don't let anybody tell you
these are stupid people

00:42:28.060 --> 00:42:28.893
who don't know.

00:42:28.893 --> 00:42:32.530
They know, and they
think they deserve them,

00:42:32.530 --> 00:42:34.640
just like most Americans,

00:42:34.640 --> 00:42:37.520
they think they've worked a lifetime,

00:42:37.520 --> 00:42:39.020
and they've paid their taxes,

00:42:39.020 --> 00:42:41.670
and they deserve these
benefits, they've earned them.

00:42:42.770 --> 00:42:46.800
So what kind of government
spending are they against?

00:42:46.800 --> 00:42:49.640
Well, it turns out they're
against government spending

00:42:49.640 --> 00:42:52.480
for freeloaders and moochers.

00:42:52.480 --> 00:42:55.250
I think we've heard this just recently,

00:42:55.250 --> 00:42:57.980
and who are the freeloaders
and the moochers?

00:42:57.980 --> 00:43:00.460
I mean, we wanted to
know, so we were all ears,

00:43:00.460 --> 00:43:01.293
and I have to tell you

00:43:01.293 --> 00:43:04.010
that in these interviews we just listened.

00:43:04.010 --> 00:43:05.960
We'd ask the softball-est questions,

00:43:05.960 --> 00:43:08.910
and just wrote down the answers
no matter what they were.

00:43:08.910 --> 00:43:13.297
So obviously illegal immigrants.

00:43:13.297 --> 00:43:16.820
They're big on the
moocher/freeloader scale.

00:43:16.820 --> 00:43:20.640
Next would be lower-income people who,

00:43:20.640 --> 00:43:22.340
given the way they're talked about,

00:43:22.340 --> 00:43:23.770
are often people of color,

00:43:23.770 --> 00:43:26.680
although people were very
careful in interviews with us

00:43:26.680 --> 00:43:30.590
never to overtly make racist statements.

00:43:30.590 --> 00:43:34.523
Except against Muslims;
no holds barred there.

00:43:37.065 --> 00:43:38.623
And young people.

00:43:39.630 --> 00:43:41.620
Young people.

00:43:41.620 --> 00:43:44.500
That was one of the most
surprising things we discovered

00:43:44.500 --> 00:43:45.940
in the interviews.

00:43:45.940 --> 00:43:48.830
People would cite their own grandkids

00:43:48.830 --> 00:43:52.569
and their own grandnephews
as examples of freeloaders.

00:43:52.569 --> 00:43:53.570
(audience chuckles)

00:43:53.570 --> 00:43:55.690
They wanted Pell Grants.

00:43:55.690 --> 00:43:57.760
They wanted food stamps.

00:43:57.760 --> 00:43:59.370
They wanted help going to college.

00:43:59.370 --> 00:44:03.130
They were moving in back
home with Mom and Dad,

00:44:03.130 --> 00:44:07.729
and not finding jobs, and
they supported that Obama,

00:44:07.729 --> 00:44:08.633
(audience chuckles)

00:44:08.633 --> 00:44:09.663
in a lot of cases.

00:44:11.360 --> 00:44:12.960
Now, older people, I can tell you,

00:44:12.960 --> 00:44:15.273
do sit around and gripe
about young people.

00:44:16.720 --> 00:44:17.893
It happens.

00:44:19.700 --> 00:44:21.720
But in tea party circles,

00:44:21.720 --> 00:44:24.200
it has a harder edge to it.

00:44:24.200 --> 00:44:26.840
It's tied to a political fear

00:44:26.840 --> 00:44:30.700
that those people are asking
for taxpayer-supported benefits

00:44:30.700 --> 00:44:32.000
that they don't deserve,

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:34.500
that they're getting ahead of themselves.

00:44:34.500 --> 00:44:37.490
Now obviously, hatred of Barack Obama

00:44:38.640 --> 00:44:42.220
brings together all of
these things at once.

00:44:42.220 --> 00:44:44.600
He's a Democrat: that's
his biggest problem,

00:44:44.600 --> 00:44:47.560
and remember, the
right-wing in this country

00:44:47.560 --> 00:44:50.960
went after Clinton with
just as much ferocity.

00:44:50.960 --> 00:44:52.440
So frankly,

00:44:52.440 --> 00:44:55.810
whenever one party takes
everything in Washington,

00:44:55.810 --> 00:44:58.930
that mobilizes the activists
of the opposite party,

00:44:58.930 --> 00:45:01.520
and when

00:45:01.520 --> 00:45:03.420
George W. Bush moved into the White House

00:45:03.420 --> 00:45:06.170
with two houses of Republicans behind him,

00:45:06.170 --> 00:45:08.660
there was despair in
Cambridge, Massachusetts,

00:45:08.660 --> 00:45:10.860
I can report that.

00:45:10.860 --> 00:45:13.960
People didn't mobilize as
fast, perhaps, but they were

00:45:13.960 --> 00:45:15.700
they thought they'd lost their country,

00:45:15.700 --> 00:45:18.360
and that's what these conservatives think,

00:45:18.360 --> 00:45:20.890
when all Democrats move in,
that they've lost their country,

00:45:20.890 --> 00:45:23.000
and I think it was even more shocking

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:26.533
that they'd lost it to somebody
named Barack Hussein Obama.

00:45:27.490 --> 00:45:29.050
His black skin may be part of it,

00:45:29.050 --> 00:45:32.080
but I think his foreign
father is a bigger part of it,

00:45:32.080 --> 00:45:34.480
because of the sense that
America's place in the world

00:45:34.480 --> 00:45:35.320
is changing,

00:45:35.320 --> 00:45:37.943
and that he might be tied to the Muslims,

00:45:39.350 --> 00:45:41.230
and that he's young,

00:45:41.230 --> 00:45:43.390
that he's a constitutional law professor

00:45:43.390 --> 00:45:46.393
who hangs out with Henry
Louis Gates at Harvard,

00:45:47.920 --> 00:45:51.080
that he is adored by the young.

00:45:51.080 --> 00:45:52.287
One woman said to us,

00:45:52.287 --> 00:45:56.980
"Two million young people
yelling, Obama, Obama, Obama!"

00:45:56.980 --> 00:45:58.630
You could hear in her voice

00:45:58.630 --> 00:46:01.503
the fear about what that
could possibly mean.

00:46:02.660 --> 00:46:05.090
So he is the perfect storm.

00:46:05.090 --> 00:46:08.653
He represents all the
changes: generational,

00:46:09.490 --> 00:46:12.683
racial, immigrant, moral,

00:46:13.700 --> 00:46:17.810
that these people fear
and want to fend off.

00:46:17.810 --> 00:46:20.920
Our country is being taken away from us.

00:46:20.920 --> 00:46:23.520
That's what they say, and
that's what they feel,

00:46:23.520 --> 00:46:25.740
and when you interview them individually,

00:46:25.740 --> 00:46:29.870
what you hear is not
so much anger as fear,

00:46:29.870 --> 00:46:34.153
and fear is a powerful,
powerful political mobilizer.

00:46:35.040 --> 00:46:36.680
Now, the other part of the tea party

00:46:36.680 --> 00:46:39.160
that I haven't mentioned, I will quickly,

00:46:39.160 --> 00:46:43.260
has nothing to do with
grassroots anger or fear.

00:46:43.260 --> 00:46:46.310
It's longstanding, ultra-free-market,

00:46:46.310 --> 00:46:50.840
billionaire-backed advocacy
groups that, for decades,

00:46:50.840 --> 00:46:53.780
have been working to turn
Social Security and Medicare

00:46:53.780 --> 00:46:56.680
into private subsidies
for insurance companies,

00:46:56.680 --> 00:46:59.343
to privatize them, or Wall Street,

00:47:00.430 --> 00:47:02.220
that wanna get rid of all regulations,

00:47:02.220 --> 00:47:03.380
that above all wanna block

00:47:03.380 --> 00:47:06.560
environmental regulations of any kind,

00:47:06.560 --> 00:47:08.193
and dismantle the EPA.

00:47:09.590 --> 00:47:12.060
Dick Armey and FreedomWorks,
the Koch brothers,

00:47:12.060 --> 00:47:13.640
and Americans for Prosperity,

00:47:13.640 --> 00:47:16.810
and various other very professionally-run,

00:47:16.810 --> 00:47:20.313
very opulently-backed advocacy groups,

00:47:21.730 --> 00:47:26.300
that, when this eruption
emerged, jumped on the bandwagon,

00:47:26.300 --> 00:47:29.800
renamed part of themselves
the tea party, in many cases,

00:47:29.800 --> 00:47:32.790
and put their elites
in front of the camera

00:47:32.790 --> 00:47:35.690
to speak for what the tea party wanted.

00:47:35.690 --> 00:47:39.600
So soon we have the
70-year-old Dick Armey,

00:47:39.600 --> 00:47:42.970
a former Republican leader in the House,

00:47:42.970 --> 00:47:45.870
a 15-year lobbyist for business interests,

00:47:45.870 --> 00:47:49.090
presenting himself as
a revolutionary leader

00:47:49.090 --> 00:47:54.090
in front of the media, to
tell the media, after 2010,

00:47:54.300 --> 00:47:57.820
media needs spokespeople
for the tea party,

00:47:57.820 --> 00:48:00.340
and the decentralized, grassroots groups

00:48:00.340 --> 00:48:04.030
are no good for that, so they
put the Dick Armeys up there,

00:48:04.030 --> 00:48:06.720
and they tell everybody the tea party

00:48:06.720 --> 00:48:09.720
wants to get rid of Social
Security and Medicare.

00:48:09.720 --> 00:48:11.070
Think of the irony of that.

00:48:13.070 --> 00:48:15.760
All right, now let me
bring us to the present,

00:48:15.760 --> 00:48:17.860
and stop so that we can have a discussion.

00:48:20.370 --> 00:48:23.930
Obviously, American politics
is not dull in our period.

00:48:23.930 --> 00:48:26.730
We went from the sweep into power

00:48:26.730 --> 00:48:29.230
of a pair of reform-oriented Democrats,

00:48:29.230 --> 00:48:33.250
perhaps on their way to building
strong majorities in 2008,

00:48:33.250 --> 00:48:38.250
to this backlash that was not
just a swing to Republicans,

00:48:38.350 --> 00:48:41.080
but something surprising
to political scientists,

00:48:41.080 --> 00:48:43.480
a swing to Republicans who
were, at the same time,

00:48:43.480 --> 00:48:46.100
being pulled far to the right,

00:48:46.100 --> 00:48:48.010
and where a pincer's movement

00:48:48.010 --> 00:48:51.960
of big money interests
and grassroots activists

00:48:51.960 --> 00:48:56.210
were enforcing a new kind
of anti-compromise orthodoxy

00:48:56.210 --> 00:49:00.030
on Republicans running for
office, or Republicans in office.

00:49:00.030 --> 00:49:04.560
You really only have to
knock a few Richard Lugars,

00:49:04.560 --> 00:49:06.750
or Bob Inglises,

00:49:06.750 --> 00:49:10.490
or I'm forgetting the
man in Utah, Bob Bennett,

00:49:10.490 --> 00:49:12.890
you only need to knock a few of them off

00:49:12.890 --> 00:49:16.370
to terrify all of them in Washington.

00:49:16.370 --> 00:49:19.300
And then they suddenly
stopped voting for anything

00:49:19.300 --> 00:49:22.443
that could be construed in
any way as a compromise.

00:49:23.280 --> 00:49:24.903
And that was the point.

00:49:25.980 --> 00:49:27.090
That was the point

00:49:27.090 --> 00:49:29.680
of the grassroots mobilization from below,

00:49:29.680 --> 00:49:32.580
of half the Republican base, half,

00:49:32.580 --> 00:49:35.600
and the more attentive half,

00:49:35.600 --> 00:49:38.420
the half that knows what's being debated,

00:49:38.420 --> 00:49:40.850
goes to the public debates,

00:49:40.850 --> 00:49:43.440
that sends delegations
to congressional offices,

00:49:43.440 --> 00:49:44.670
that sends letters,

00:49:44.670 --> 00:49:47.830
all the things citizens are
supposed to do, by the way,

00:49:47.830 --> 00:49:49.480
they do them.

00:49:49.480 --> 00:49:50.580
And you combine that

00:49:50.580 --> 00:49:54.240
with the money that can
flow into any election

00:49:54.240 --> 00:49:59.120
to fund a challenger to a
too-moderate Republican,

00:49:59.120 --> 00:50:01.410
and that's where you get
to the situation we've had

00:50:01.410 --> 00:50:02.250
in the last two years,

00:50:02.250 --> 00:50:06.240
where Republicans refuse
to compromise on anything.

00:50:06.240 --> 00:50:07.470
Came very close

00:50:07.470 --> 00:50:10.770
to pushing the United States
of America into default,

00:50:10.770 --> 00:50:13.250
and the local tea partiers
I knew in Virginia, who

00:50:13.250 --> 00:50:15.920
lovely people, a lot of
the really lovely people,

00:50:15.920 --> 00:50:20.390
they were all for it, on
the grounds that, well,

00:50:20.390 --> 00:50:23.520
things were a mess already, so
why not just go all the way?

00:50:23.520 --> 00:50:24.600
The last time I heard that

00:50:24.600 --> 00:50:27.560
was when I was a new leftist in my 20s,

00:50:27.560 --> 00:50:29.657
and there were Leninist arguing that,

00:50:29.657 --> 00:50:33.560
and it was stupid then,
and it's stupid now,

00:50:33.560 --> 00:50:35.820
but that's the kind of pressure

00:50:35.820 --> 00:50:38.500
that Republican officeholders
and candidates are getting,

00:50:38.500 --> 00:50:41.250
and which Republicans, office-seekers,

00:50:41.250 --> 00:50:43.270
have not held up against.

00:50:43.270 --> 00:50:46.473
And a case in point is
a man named Mitt Romney,

00:50:47.890 --> 00:50:51.790
who has signed on to
every extreme grassroots

00:50:51.790 --> 00:50:55.590
and elite tea party
priority that there is.

00:50:55.590 --> 00:50:57.790
I thought he was doing it stealthily.

00:50:57.790 --> 00:50:59.330
I wrote an op-ed in April

00:50:59.330 --> 00:51:01.990
calling him the stealth
tea party candidate.

00:51:01.990 --> 00:51:03.173
Forget the stealth.

00:51:04.520 --> 00:51:06.510
He's open about it.

00:51:06.510 --> 00:51:09.220
He's both endorsing the
crackdown on immigrants

00:51:09.220 --> 00:51:11.980
that the grassroots prioritize,

00:51:11.980 --> 00:51:14.470
and the rollback of the
New Deal and Great Society,

00:51:14.470 --> 00:51:16.940
and the privatization of
Social Security and Medicare,

00:51:16.940 --> 00:51:18.543
which is what Ryan stands for,

00:51:19.760 --> 00:51:22.130
who is a protege of the Koch brothers,

00:51:22.130 --> 00:51:25.040
brought up in the Americans
for Prosperity network

00:51:25.040 --> 00:51:26.003
in the Midwest.

00:51:27.180 --> 00:51:31.840
So this is quite a turnaround,

00:51:31.840 --> 00:51:34.130
and what's gonna happen next?

00:51:34.130 --> 00:51:36.123
Well, you know as well as I do.

00:51:37.140 --> 00:51:38.530
I can't predict.

00:51:38.530 --> 00:51:41.540
All I can tell you is what
the possibilities are.

00:51:41.540 --> 00:51:44.490
It turns out that the 2012 election

00:51:44.490 --> 00:51:47.770
is an even more important
election that 2008.

00:51:47.770 --> 00:51:50.100
It's one of the most important elections

00:51:50.100 --> 00:51:51.363
in American history,

00:51:52.690 --> 00:51:56.040
because it really is going to determine

00:51:56.040 --> 00:51:59.690
whether the attempts to, with difficulty,

00:51:59.690 --> 00:52:03.200
transform the direction of American tax,

00:52:03.200 --> 00:52:05.130
social policy, regulatory policy,

00:52:05.130 --> 00:52:09.820
that Obama haltingly
and imperfectly launched

00:52:09.820 --> 00:52:11.690
after 2008,

00:52:11.690 --> 00:52:14.240
will survive,

00:52:14.240 --> 00:52:18.730
the parts, like Affordable
Care, that passed, and proceed,

00:52:18.730 --> 00:52:21.100
or whether we're gonna see,

00:52:21.100 --> 00:52:24.157
not just at rollback of Affordable Care

00:52:24.157 --> 00:52:26.450
and the other Obama reforms,

00:52:26.450 --> 00:52:27.780
like the Wall Street regulations,

00:52:27.780 --> 00:52:29.980
however imperfect they may be,

00:52:29.980 --> 00:52:34.100
but a radical rollback

00:52:34.100 --> 00:52:35.770
of the place of government

00:52:35.770 --> 00:52:37.550
in providing security and opportunity.

00:52:37.550 --> 00:52:40.110
I haven't even talked about
educational investments.

00:52:40.110 --> 00:52:43.663
Those are all there in the radicalized GOP

00:52:45.229 --> 00:52:49.600
and Mitt Romney program, and believe me,

00:52:49.600 --> 00:52:53.870
if they control the presidency,
the House, and the Senate,

00:52:53.870 --> 00:52:55.853
they'll do it in three months.

00:52:57.290 --> 00:53:01.130
Filibusters will not matter;
they'll be overridden.

00:53:01.130 --> 00:53:03.683
The Congressional Budget
Office will not matter;

00:53:05.020 --> 00:53:06.920
it will be set aside.

00:53:06.920 --> 00:53:09.210
It'll happen very fast,

00:53:09.210 --> 00:53:12.853
because they think it's their last chance.

00:53:14.330 --> 00:53:17.210
They see generational, and racial,

00:53:17.210 --> 00:53:19.160
and social changes in the United States

00:53:19.160 --> 00:53:21.560
that are going to make it impossible

00:53:21.560 --> 00:53:24.650
to realize these conservative goals,

00:53:24.650 --> 00:53:29.133
which are heartfelt
for most conservatives,

00:53:30.190 --> 00:53:32.580
if they wait even one more election.

00:53:32.580 --> 00:53:34.103
So they're not gonna wait.

00:53:35.360 --> 00:53:37.783
On the other hand, if Obama is reelected,

00:53:39.260 --> 00:53:43.020
the major accomplishments of
what I call halfway New Deal,

00:53:43.020 --> 00:53:47.900
which really were major,
the Affordable Care Act,

00:53:47.900 --> 00:53:50.483
I don't care if it doesn't
have a public option,

00:53:51.950 --> 00:53:56.000
it is one of the most
redistributive pieces of legislation

00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:58.770
ever to pass in modern America.

00:53:58.770 --> 00:54:02.250
It taxes the wealthy
and business interests

00:54:02.250 --> 00:54:04.970
to provide health insurance

00:54:04.970 --> 00:54:07.380
to millions of low-income

00:54:07.380 --> 00:54:10.323
and lower-middle-income working families.

00:54:12.850 --> 00:54:16.120
Its opponent know exactly what it is,

00:54:16.120 --> 00:54:19.960
and they understand that if
it is implemented after 2014,

00:54:19.960 --> 00:54:23.940
Americans will want to
keep its major parts.

00:54:23.940 --> 00:54:27.030
All of its specific parts
except the individual mandate

00:54:27.030 --> 00:54:28.563
are highly popular.

00:54:30.050 --> 00:54:31.540
Once they're actually in place,

00:54:31.540 --> 00:54:34.270
along with the Medicare drug benefit,

00:54:34.270 --> 00:54:37.340
the 26-year-olds on
the parents' insurance,

00:54:37.340 --> 00:54:40.130
the new rules of the game
for insurance companies,

00:54:40.130 --> 00:54:42.110
they will cement a new relationship

00:54:42.110 --> 00:54:45.740
between the however-muddling
Democratic Party

00:54:45.740 --> 00:54:47.150
that passed them,

00:54:47.150 --> 00:54:49.130
and the American majority,

00:54:49.130 --> 00:54:51.760
and so a lot is at stake politically,

00:54:51.760 --> 00:54:53.360
as well as socioeconomically,

00:54:53.360 --> 00:54:56.860
in the mere survival of that law.

00:54:56.860 --> 00:55:00.420
It will survive if Democrats
survive one of the three.

00:55:00.420 --> 00:55:02.303
It won't if they're swept.

00:55:03.680 --> 00:55:05.180
And that's just the beginning.

00:55:06.470 --> 00:55:09.900
The EPA may be gone, or it may stay on,

00:55:09.900 --> 00:55:14.150
and the EPA is being
used, however haltingly,

00:55:14.150 --> 00:55:17.850
to push in the direction of new kind of

00:55:17.850 --> 00:55:20.033
uses of energy in the United States.

00:55:21.930 --> 00:55:24.883
The student loan reforms,
the investments in education,

00:55:25.800 --> 00:55:29.080
they won't survive, perhaps,
in as generously-funded a way

00:55:29.080 --> 00:55:31.090
as anybody thinks is necessary,

00:55:31.090 --> 00:55:32.620
but they'll be there,

00:55:32.620 --> 00:55:35.560
and that's a big difference
from not being there.

00:55:35.560 --> 00:55:39.370
So it's a very important election,

00:55:39.370 --> 00:55:41.600
and it remains to be seen

00:55:41.600 --> 00:55:45.300
whether the lagging economic recovery,

00:55:45.300 --> 00:55:48.680
the imperfectly-explained
Obama economic measures,

00:55:48.680 --> 00:55:50.940
Bill Clinton did a better
job of explaining it

00:55:50.940 --> 00:55:52.803
than Barack Obama ever did,

00:55:54.840 --> 00:55:57.780
and the irritating changes

00:55:57.780 --> 00:56:01.570
whose payoffs to the
majority are not yet clear,

00:56:01.570 --> 00:56:03.410
whether, with all of that baggage,

00:56:03.410 --> 00:56:07.400
Obama can squeak through to reelection.

00:56:07.400 --> 00:56:10.170
Now the one reason to
think it might happen,

00:56:10.170 --> 00:56:12.023
apart from Mitt Romney.

00:56:12.023 --> 00:56:14.287
(audience laughing)

00:56:14.287 --> 00:56:17.287
(audience clapping)

00:56:18.230 --> 00:56:19.730
By the way, no tea partiers

00:56:19.730 --> 00:56:21.620
that we interviewed in the spring of 2011

00:56:21.620 --> 00:56:24.210
were enthusiastic about Mitt Romney,

00:56:24.210 --> 00:56:25.560
and you know why, they said?

00:56:25.560 --> 00:56:27.775
They said he's not authentic.

00:56:27.775 --> 00:56:28.750
(audience murmuring)

00:56:28.750 --> 00:56:30.653
Not authentic.

00:56:32.110 --> 00:56:34.010
People didn't name policies.

00:56:34.010 --> 00:56:36.683
They said, he's not authentic.

00:56:39.800 --> 00:56:43.895
I wrote in my notes,
something we can all agree on.

00:56:43.895 --> 00:56:46.542
(audience laughing)

00:56:46.542 --> 00:56:49.242
I mean, he was governor of
Massachusetts as a liberal.

00:56:50.150 --> 00:56:52.583
So apart from that,

00:56:53.580 --> 00:56:55.930
the thing that is different this time

00:56:55.930 --> 00:56:57.840
is that in 2010,

00:56:57.840 --> 00:57:01.630
two out of five eligible
voters went to the polls,

00:57:01.630 --> 00:57:04.180
skewed toward the old, the
white, the conservative.

00:57:05.360 --> 00:57:08.620
The way it always happens in
midterm elections, but more so,

00:57:08.620 --> 00:57:12.470
because the elderly swung
heavily against the Democrats,

00:57:12.470 --> 00:57:15.300
they were convinced that
Medicare was being destroyed,

00:57:15.300 --> 00:57:17.593
that death panels were
being put into place.

00:57:18.900 --> 00:57:19.910
In this election,

00:57:19.910 --> 00:57:23.580
we'll be closer to the three
out of five eligible voters

00:57:23.580 --> 00:57:25.890
that went to the polls in 2008,

00:57:25.890 --> 00:57:28.010
and the outcome may very well depend

00:57:28.010 --> 00:57:29.943
on how much closer we are.

00:57:31.050 --> 00:57:34.410
Because if you just ask for opinions,

00:57:34.410 --> 00:57:38.433
if you just ask registered
voters, even, Obama's way ahead,

00:57:39.340 --> 00:57:40.550
but he's not way ahead

00:57:40.550 --> 00:57:43.043
among those who are
necessarily going to vote.

00:57:44.080 --> 00:57:48.550
So it's quite a cliffhanger,
in my opinion, still,

00:57:48.550 --> 00:57:50.640
particularly since a
billion and a half of ads

00:57:50.640 --> 00:57:55.020
are about to be unleashed
in the swing states,

00:57:55.020 --> 00:57:56.963
most of them on the Republican side,

00:57:57.820 --> 00:57:59.620
but the outcome on November 6th

00:57:59.620 --> 00:58:03.520
will tell us a lot about
the kind of country

00:58:03.520 --> 00:58:08.400
we're going to be moving toward

00:58:08.400 --> 00:58:11.320
over the coming months and years.

00:58:11.320 --> 00:58:13.592
So let me stop on that.

00:58:13.592 --> 00:58:16.759
(audience applauding)
