symmetrical movement sometimes so I

00:09:54.690 --> 00:09:54.700
symmetrical movement sometimes so I
 

00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:56.430
symmetrical movement sometimes so I
think that the existence of the global

00:09:56.430 --> 00:09:56.440
think that the existence of the global
 

00:09:56.440 --> 00:10:00.449
think that the existence of the global
center is very important to help us even

00:10:00.449 --> 00:10:00.459
center is very important to help us even
 

00:10:00.459 --> 00:10:02.069

collaboration that would be yet even
 

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:07.139
collaboration that would be yet even
more meaningful not only for the

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:50.829
 
I when when John said that we had the

00:10:50.829 --> 00:10:50.839
I when when John said that we had the
 

00:10:50.839 --> 00:10:52.980
I when when John said that we had the
opportunity to open up the center and

00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:52.990
opportunity to open up the center and
 

00:10:52.990 --> 00:10:57.250

chili I took a deep breath because we

00:10:57.250 --> 00:10:57.260
chili I took a deep breath because we
 

00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:59.650
chili I took a deep breath because we
were really very busy trying to swallow

00:10:59.650 --> 00:10:59.660
were really very busy trying to swallow
 

00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:03.040
were really very busy trying to swallow
the ones we had already started and and

00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:03.050
the ones we had already started and and
 

00:11:03.050 --> 00:11:04.689
the ones we had already started and and
I was hesitant and that kind of stuff

00:11:04.689 --> 00:11:04.699
I was hesitant and that kind of stuff
 

00:11:04.699 --> 00:11:06.759
I was hesitant and that kind of stuff
and on the other hand it's extremely

00:11:06.759 --> 00:11:06.769
and on the other hand it's extremely
 

00:11:06.769 --> 00:11:08.949
and on the other hand it's extremely
important because we cannot be a global

00:11:08.949 --> 00:11:08.959
important because we cannot be a global
 

00:11:08.959 --> 00:11:10.569
important because we cannot be a global
network until we're in Latin America and

00:11:10.569 --> 00:11:10.579
network until we're in Latin America and
 

00:11:10.579 --> 00:11:13.900
network until we're in Latin America and
you've now made that happen so for the

00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:13.910
you've now made that happen so for the
 

00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:15.819
you've now made that happen so for the
first time we really can very first time

00:11:15.819 --> 00:11:15.829
first time we really can very first time
 

00:11:15.829 --> 00:11:17.949
first time we really can very first time
in the history of this project we can

00:11:17.949 --> 00:11:17.959
in the history of this project we can
 

00:11:17.959 --> 00:11:19.750
in the history of this project we can
say we're now a global network we were

00:11:19.750 --> 00:11:19.760
say we're now a global network we were
 

00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:24.280
say we're now a global network we were
just everywhere but my my hesitancy ease

00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:24.290
just everywhere but my my hesitancy ease
 

00:11:24.290 --> 00:11:25.569
just everywhere but my my hesitancy ease
were just about the amount of work that

00:11:25.569 --> 00:11:25.579
were just about the amount of work that
 

00:11:25.579 --> 00:11:27.540
were just about the amount of work that
had to be done on the lazy kind of guy

00:11:27.540 --> 00:11:27.550
had to be done on the lazy kind of guy
 

00:11:27.550 --> 00:11:32.800
had to be done on the lazy kind of guy
and then in my office walk Karen cut me

00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:32.810
and then in my office walk Karen cut me
 

00:11:32.810 --> 00:11:34.930
and then in my office walk Karen cut me

a check I said my God my problems are
 

00:11:34.940 --> 00:11:38.800
a check I said my God my problems are
solved we've got somebody already there

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:38.810
solved we've got somebody already there
 

00:11:38.810 --> 00:11:42.210

I can the the idea is really to create a
new kind of University which has a

00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:13.670
new kind of University which has a
 

00:12:13.670 --> 00:12:16.900
new kind of University which has a
global presence so it's not just a

00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:16.910
global presence so it's not just a
 

00:12:16.910 --> 00:12:19.870
global presence so it's not just a
series of bilateral relationship with

challenges that that are facing us we
 

00:12:30.199 --> 00:12:31.840
challenges that that are facing us we
know those global challenges I won't

knowledgeable about parts of the world
 

00:14:14.170 --> 00:14:18.140
knowledgeable about parts of the world
including Latin America so we we have

00:14:18.140 --> 00:14:18.150
including Latin America so we we have
 

00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:24.540
including Latin America so we we have
great experts on on everything making

00:14:24.540 --> 00:14:24.550
great experts on on everything making
 

00:14:24.550 --> 00:14:27.360
great experts on on everything making
sure that those experts are able to

00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:27.370
sure that those experts are able to
 

00:14:27.370 --> 00:14:30.240
sure that those experts are able to
develop their expertise even further and

00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:30.250
develop their expertise even further and
 

00:14:30.250 --> 00:14:33.060

to spread that expertise and to share it

00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:33.070
to spread that expertise and to share it
 

00:14:33.070 --> 00:14:36.870
to spread that expertise and to share it
with others is a goal in itself for

00:14:36.870 --> 00:14:36.880
with others is a goal in itself for
 

00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:39.930
with others is a goal in itself for
University and would be I think a

00:14:39.930 --> 00:14:39.940
University and would be I think a
 

00:14:39.940 --> 00:14:42.330
University and would be I think a
sufficient justification for this new

00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:49.920
center in Santiago but it so happens we
have another reason and the other reason

00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:49.930
have another reason and the other reason
 

00:14:49.930 --> 00:14:53.240
have another reason and the other reason
is because of the phenomena of

00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:53.250
is because of the phenomena of
 

00:14:53.250 --> 00:14:56.400
is because of the phenomena of
globalization and it's a cliche of

00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:56.410
globalization and it's a cliche of
 

00:14:56.410 --> 00:14:58.860
globalization and it's a cliche of
course to talk in terms of globalization

00:14:58.860 --> 00:14:58.870
course to talk in terms of globalization
 

00:14:58.870 --> 00:15:02.220
course to talk in terms of globalization
at this stage but I believe that every

00:15:02.220 --> 00:15:02.230
at this stage but I believe that every
 

00:15:02.230 --> 00:15:05.660
at this stage but I believe that every
single one of us understands that that

00:15:05.660 --> 00:15:05.670
single one of us understands that that
 

00:15:05.670 --> 00:15:08.970
single one of us understands that that
there are forces at work in today's

00:15:08.970 --> 00:15:08.980
there are forces at work in today's
 

00:15:08.980 --> 00:15:13.269
there are forces at work in today's
world that are creating

00:15:13.269 --> 00:15:13.279
world that are creating
 

00:15:13.279 --> 00:15:16.199
world that are creating
increasingly interdependent world

00:15:16.199 --> 00:15:16.209
increasingly interdependent world
 

00:15:16.209 --> 00:15:19.480
increasingly interdependent world
especially in the sphere of economic

00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:19.490
especially in the sphere of economic
 

00:15:19.490 --> 00:15:22.389
especially in the sphere of economic
activity and it's just no longer

00:15:22.389 --> 00:15:22.399
activity and it's just no longer
 

00:15:22.399 --> 00:15:26.920

possible for anybody whether you're an

possible for anybody whether you're an
expert in Latin America or an expert on

expert in Latin America or an expert on
 

00:15:30.019 --> 00:15:32.949
expert in Latin America or an expert on
any other subject it's just not possible

00:15:32.949 --> 00:15:32.959
any other subject it's just not possible
 

00:15:32.959 --> 00:15:36.100
any other subject it's just not possible
any longer to think about your field in

00:15:36.100 --> 00:15:36.110
any longer to think about your field in
 

00:15:36.110 --> 00:15:40.749
any longer to think about your field in
all probability unless you have a deeper

all probability unless you have a deeper

knowledge of what is happening around

00:15:42.999 --> 00:15:43.009

the world it's also extremely difficult

00:15:48.189 --> 00:15:48.199
the world it's also extremely difficult
 

00:15:48.199 --> 00:15:51.309
the world it's also extremely difficult
to get that knowledge because this is

00:15:51.309 --> 00:15:51.319
to get that knowledge because this is
 

00:15:51.319 --> 00:15:53.650
to get that knowledge because this is
not a case where you can simply go to

00:15:53.650 --> 00:15:53.660
not a case where you can simply go to
 

00:15:53.660 --> 00:15:56.379
not a case where you can simply go to
the library or turn on your computer and

00:15:56.379 --> 00:15:56.389
the library or turn on your computer and
 

00:15:56.389 --> 00:15:59.590
the library or turn on your computer and
read new books about it the world has

00:15:59.590 --> 00:15:59.600
read new books about it the world has
 

00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:03.639
read new books about it the world has
moved in our view faster it is changing

00:16:03.639 --> 00:16:03.649
moved in our view faster it is changing
 

00:16:03.649 --> 00:16:09.189
moved in our view faster it is changing
faster than our knowledge and so we have

00:16:09.189 --> 00:16:09.199
faster than our knowledge and so we have
 

00:16:09.199 --> 00:16:14.139
faster than our knowledge and so we have
to in universities figure out ways for

00:16:14.139 --> 00:16:14.149
to in universities figure out ways for
 

00:16:14.149 --> 00:16:18.189
to in universities figure out ways for
us to catch up and to perform our great

00:16:18.189 --> 00:16:18.199
us to catch up and to perform our great
 

00:16:18.199 --> 00:16:21.519
us to catch up and to perform our great

are our way of doing that in one sense

00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:33.110
are our way of doing that in one sense
 

00:16:33.110 --> 00:16:35.799
are our way of doing that in one sense
they're simply offices with wonderful

in our teaching and our research some
universities are setting up branch

universities are setting up branch
 

00:17:26.930 --> 00:17:30.070
universities are setting up branch
campuses some are setting up networks of

universities some are simply doing what
 

00:17:33.230 --> 00:17:35.230
universities some are simply doing what
they've been doing but trying to do it a

they've been doing but trying to do it a
 

00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:40.030
they've been doing but trying to do it a
little more all those are fine we're not

00:17:40.030 --> 00:17:40.040
little more all those are fine we're not
 

00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:42.880
little more all those are fine we're not
doing the branch campus route we're not

00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:42.890
doing the branch campus route we're not
 

00:17:42.890 --> 00:17:44.980
doing the branch campus route we're not
doing some other routes this is our

00:17:44.980 --> 00:17:44.990
doing some other routes this is our
 

00:17:44.990 --> 00:17:50.830
doing some other routes this is our
route and the function is exactly what

00:17:50.830 --> 00:17:50.840
route and the function is exactly what
 

00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:53.320
route and the function is exactly what
you said we're trying to do that is we

00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:53.330
you said we're trying to do that is we
 

00:17:53.330 --> 00:17:55.510
you said we're trying to do that is we
are at the university are trying to

00:17:55.510 --> 00:17:55.520
are at the university are trying to
 

00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:58.720
are at the university are trying to
facilitate the opportunities for our

00:17:58.720 --> 00:17:58.730
facilitate the opportunities for our
 

00:17:58.730 --> 00:18:01.470
facilitate the opportunities for our
faculty and students to work with local

that in a global way on serious problems

00:18:11.410 --> 00:18:11.420
that in a global way on serious problems
 

00:18:11.420 --> 00:18:15.940
that in a global way on serious problems
that matter so it's a it's a very very

00:18:15.940 --> 00:18:15.950
that matter so it's a it's a very very
 

00:18:15.950 --> 00:18:20.020
that matter so it's a it's a very very
important ambition grounded we think in

00:18:20.020 --> 00:18:20.030
important ambition grounded we think in
 

00:18:20.030 --> 00:18:21.640
important ambition grounded we think in
an understanding of the world and the

00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:21.650
an understanding of the world and the
 

00:18:21.650 --> 00:18:24.520
an understanding of the world and the
relation of relationship of universities

00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:24.530
relation of relationship of universities
 

00:18:24.530 --> 00:18:26.860
relation of relationship of universities
to that world and the last thing I want

00:18:26.860 --> 00:18:26.870
to that world and the last thing I want
 

00:18:26.870 --> 00:18:30.820
to that world and the last thing I want
to say is that this requires in every

00:18:30.820 --> 00:18:30.830
to say is that this requires in every
 

00:18:30.830 --> 00:18:33.130
to say is that this requires in every
instance because our resources at this

00:18:33.130 --> 00:18:33.140
instance because our resources at this
 

00:18:33.140 --> 00:18:37.060
instance because our resources at this
university are so thin and needed for so

00:18:37.060 --> 00:18:37.070
university are so thin and needed for so
 

00:18:37.070 --> 00:18:39.669
university are so thin and needed for so
many purposes we're pursuing all the

00:18:39.669 --> 00:18:39.679
many purposes we're pursuing all the
 

00:18:39.679 --> 00:18:44.980
many purposes we're pursuing all the
time we need to have friends and we need

00:18:44.980 --> 00:18:44.990
time we need to have friends and we need
 

00:18:44.990 --> 00:18:47.500
time we need to have friends and we need
to have people to help us understand how

00:18:47.500 --> 00:18:47.510
to have people to help us understand how
 

00:18:47.510 --> 00:18:50.440
to have people to help us understand how
to do this best and you have done that

00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:50.450
to do this best and you have done that
 

00:18:50.450 --> 00:18:53.200
to do this best and you have done that
now for us with Santiago the first in

will mark the point at which we
 

00:19:41.130 --> 00:20:39.210
will mark the point at which we
officially inaugurate the center
