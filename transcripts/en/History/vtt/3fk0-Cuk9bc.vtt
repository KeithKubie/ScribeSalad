00:00:02.919 --> 00:00:06.548
NARRATOR: An ancient painting
on a cave wall in Africa.

00:00:06.548 --> 00:00:11.177
Ceremonial clay objects
discovered in Sweden.

00:00:11.177 --> 00:00:15.390
A mysterious sculpture
found in China.

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:18.601
Throughout the ancient world,
there is a symbol that is

00:00:18.601 --> 00:00:21.187
more pervasive than any other--

00:00:21.187 --> 00:00:23.398
the symbol of the egg.

00:00:23.398 --> 00:00:25.567
[music playing]

00:00:27.527 --> 00:00:28.987
JONATHAN YOUNG: The
egg is one of the most

00:00:28.987 --> 00:00:31.489
universal sacred images.

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:35.910
It is more widespread than the
cross or the star or the wheel.

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.580
It appeals to people in
all corners of the Earth,

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:42.125
in all times and traditions.

00:00:42.125 --> 00:00:45.628
ERICH VON DANIKEN: We found
stone eggs all over the world.

00:00:45.628 --> 00:00:50.467
For example, stone eggs
were found in Egypt.

00:00:50.467 --> 00:00:55.305
And even on Easter Island,
a stone egg was found.

00:00:55.305 --> 00:01:01.186
So the symbol of egg
is a worldwide symbol.

00:01:01.186 --> 00:01:03.855
RICHARD RADER: What's
amazing is that the egg, what

00:01:03.855 --> 00:01:09.068
we call the egg cosmogony, is a
feature of several cosmogonies.

00:01:09.068 --> 00:01:12.197
We have it in the
Nordic tradition.

00:01:12.197 --> 00:01:14.407
We have it in the
Mediterranean tradition, not

00:01:14.407 --> 00:01:19.120
only Greco Roman, but Egyptian
and also the Phoenician

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:20.413
mythologies.

00:01:20.413 --> 00:01:22.332
We also have it in
some Middle Eastern

00:01:22.332 --> 00:01:24.876
and even Vedic mythologies.

00:01:24.876 --> 00:01:30.507
So these are radically
different cultures.

00:01:30.507 --> 00:01:33.009
Is it possible that
there's a common origin

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:36.137
for South American,
Native American,

00:01:36.137 --> 00:01:39.724
Norse, and Vedic mythology?

00:01:39.724 --> 00:01:43.102
We have no evidence,
so it would be

00:01:43.102 --> 00:01:47.232
hard to say where
they come from and why

00:01:47.232 --> 00:01:51.194
they all use this image.

00:01:51.194 --> 00:01:54.489
NARRATOR: Why is it that
so many ancient cultures

00:01:54.489 --> 00:02:01.704
separated by thousands of miles
all use the symbol of the egg?

00:02:01.704 --> 00:02:04.916
For one thing, obviously,
it is associated with birth.

00:02:04.916 --> 00:02:08.461
Well birth is a great mystery,
so it's the worship of life.

00:02:08.461 --> 00:02:11.214
It is also taken as
a symbol of rebirth.

00:02:11.214 --> 00:02:13.591
We use it at the Easter
time in the spring.

00:02:13.591 --> 00:02:15.718
[music playing]

00:02:15.718 --> 00:02:20.265
RICHARD RADER: The cultures that
birth these stories recognized

00:02:20.265 --> 00:02:25.061
something in the story
of birth, of creation,

00:02:25.061 --> 00:02:28.022
of fertility, of
reproduction that was

00:02:28.022 --> 00:02:31.901
meaningful for their stories.

00:02:31.901 --> 00:02:35.029
NARRATOR: While the most obvious
interpretation of the egg

00:02:35.029 --> 00:02:38.491
is that it symbolizes fertility
and the natural creation

00:02:38.491 --> 00:02:42.871
of life, some researchers
question why there are so

00:02:42.871 --> 00:02:47.000
many depictions of eggs found
throughout the ancient world

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.295
that show humans
emerging from them.

00:02:50.295 --> 00:02:51.921
DAVID CHILDRESS: We
have these many stories

00:02:51.921 --> 00:02:55.592
from around the world
of how life starts

00:02:55.592 --> 00:02:59.888
in the form of an egg,
including human life, too,

00:02:59.888 --> 00:03:02.891
starting with a
sperm and an egg.

00:03:02.891 --> 00:03:07.145
But how would ancient
people realize that humans

00:03:07.145 --> 00:03:09.981
also have these eggs?

00:03:09.981 --> 00:03:11.774
[music playing]

00:03:11.774 --> 00:03:15.028
NARRATOR: Could ancient people
have somehow had the knowledge

00:03:15.028 --> 00:03:18.072
that humans emerged from eggs?

00:03:18.072 --> 00:03:21.743
Or might this symbol have
held a less literal and more

00:03:21.743 --> 00:03:24.537
profound meaning
for them, one that

00:03:24.537 --> 00:03:29.667
reveals an extra
terrestrial connection?

00:03:29.667 --> 00:03:32.253
Ancient astronaut
theorists suggest

00:03:32.253 --> 00:03:34.797
that the stories
connected to the egg

00:03:34.797 --> 00:03:38.593
provide undeniable evidence
that this was not simply

00:03:38.593 --> 00:03:42.138
a representation of fertility.

00:03:42.138 --> 00:03:45.058
Nearly as widespread as
the symbol of the egg

00:03:45.058 --> 00:03:49.562
is a concept commonly
known as the cosmic egg.

00:03:49.562 --> 00:03:52.315
While the name varies
from culture to culture,

00:03:52.315 --> 00:03:55.652
the story is always
nearly identical--

00:03:55.652 --> 00:03:59.489
that the entire universe
originated from an egg.

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:01.324
They're called cosmic eggs.

00:04:01.324 --> 00:04:02.575
They're called silver eggs.

00:04:02.575 --> 00:04:04.494
They're called magic eggs.

00:04:04.494 --> 00:04:06.955
They're called enchanted eggs.

00:04:06.955 --> 00:04:08.873
They're called the
eggs of the gods.

00:04:08.873 --> 00:04:11.376
I mean, all around
the world, there

00:04:11.376 --> 00:04:16.589
are these creation stories
of the egg breaking open

00:04:16.589 --> 00:04:20.218
and the water of
life coming out.

00:04:20.218 --> 00:04:22.929
In Chinese mythology,
there is this notion

00:04:22.929 --> 00:04:29.477
that the universe emerges
out of a primordial chaos.

00:04:29.477 --> 00:04:32.939
And this primordial
chaos, in many accounts,

00:04:32.939 --> 00:04:34.732
is self-contained.

00:04:34.732 --> 00:04:37.235
It's like a cosmic egg.

00:04:37.235 --> 00:04:41.948
And from this primordial chaos,
which contains everything,

00:04:41.948 --> 00:04:44.784
the universe is
generated, And first, it

00:04:44.784 --> 00:04:48.037
divides into two principles,
yin and yang, and then

00:04:48.037 --> 00:04:50.581
three, and then 10,000.

00:04:50.581 --> 00:04:51.582
Basically, ad infinitum.
