00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:05.567
What does "genius"
mean, to me?

00:00:05.567 --> 00:00:07.734
I think there are
many brilliant people

00:00:07.734 --> 00:00:09.834
in the world, many people who
are very, very intelligent.

00:00:09.834 --> 00:00:12.300
So I think it has to do
with a line of dialogue

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.433
that I think we have in
the first episode, which is

00:00:14.433 --> 00:00:19.200
"A genius is not just answering
questions but asking questions

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.867
that nobody else
thought to ask."

00:00:20.867 --> 00:00:22.800
You don't need to raise your
hand to speak here, Albert.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.633
There's a particular thing
that happens to you when

00:00:24.633 --> 00:00:26.133
you watch people do
something that they're

00:00:26.133 --> 00:00:27.367
really, really good at.

00:00:27.367 --> 00:00:28.767
It's a sensation.

00:00:28.767 --> 00:00:31.433
It's like a-- it can be a
six-year-old kid drawing

00:00:31.433 --> 00:00:33.100
something, or it
can be a painter,

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:37.066
like, applying wall color, but
they're just very, very good.

00:00:37.066 --> 00:00:39.800
You kind of know whenever you
witness somebody being really,

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.433
really excellent at something.

00:00:41.433 --> 00:00:45.066
It's a profound experience to be
able to be around it, you know?

00:00:45.066 --> 00:00:48.400
And I think that,
to me, really, is--

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.400
watching somebody doing
something special.

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.867
Unless we can define time--

00:00:53.867 --> 00:00:57.000
Most people would agree that,
whoever the geniuses are--

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.233
and you could say it's the
people that can combine ideas

00:01:01.233 --> 00:01:03.266
that are staring everyone
else in the face,

00:01:03.266 --> 00:01:06.667
but they somehow connect
something that no one's even

00:01:06.667 --> 00:01:07.433
thought about.

00:01:07.433 --> 00:01:09.467
Like Mozart's metronome.

00:01:09.467 --> 00:01:11.133
GEOFFREY RUSH: I found the
quote that Schopenhauer made.

00:01:11.133 --> 00:01:16.066
He has this great quote where
he says "Talent hits a target

00:01:16.066 --> 00:01:17.734
that no one else can hit.

00:01:17.734 --> 00:01:21.000
Genius hits a target that
no one else can see."

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.500
Close your eyes.

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:23.800
GEOFFREY RUSH: And then, if
you apply that to someone

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.266
like Einstein, he
would engage in what he

00:01:26.266 --> 00:01:27.834
called "thought experiments."

00:01:27.834 --> 00:01:31.800
He'd just let his mind wander
and drift off and speculate

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.233
about [inaudible].

00:01:33.233 --> 00:01:35.700
He was always obsessed,
right from his youth--

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.567
what if I could travel as
fast as the speed of light?

00:01:39.567 --> 00:01:42.233
What would light look
like, next to me?

00:01:42.233 --> 00:01:44.133
Now, I'm imagining
that the ball

00:01:44.133 --> 00:01:45.967
is traveling in deep space.

00:01:45.967 --> 00:01:50.200
The most elegant answer to the
question of "what is a genius"

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:51.767
was given to me by Ron Howard.

00:01:51.767 --> 00:01:55.333
Scientists, they live in
the light of knowledge.

00:01:55.333 --> 00:01:58.633
They're working, and they're
refining their knowledge,

00:01:58.633 --> 00:02:01.500
and they're testing
things, all the time.

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.266
Some scientists operate
at the edge of the light,

00:02:04.266 --> 00:02:05.967
where the dark is, which--

00:02:05.967 --> 00:02:07.633
nobody knows what's in the dark.

00:02:07.633 --> 00:02:13.767
But a tiny number of scientists
jump right into the dark

00:02:13.767 --> 00:02:17.533
and create their own
light, around them.

00:02:17.533 --> 00:02:21.633
It's a combination of vision
and absolute determination

00:02:21.633 --> 00:02:23.533
that you're right,
that you're totally

00:02:23.533 --> 00:02:27.233
convinced that this leap into
the dark that you've made

00:02:27.233 --> 00:02:28.400
is right.

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.600
And Einstein
definitely qualifies.

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:32.266
And that--

00:02:32.266 --> 00:02:33.100
--to the sun!

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:35.500
--to me, is genius.

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.767
I have another question.
