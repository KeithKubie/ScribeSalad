1
00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:05.870
Hello freak bitches, shit from him. Put Cosby out. Oh God, was this,

2
00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:07.310
that was a surprise. Yeah.

3
00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:10.370
<v 1>Was it done? Did you, did you ever hear the rumors? No.</v>

4
00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:13.460
See I did in show business circles because, uh,

5
00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:17.660
briefly I lived in the actor's world right when I was on news radio and I would

6
00:00:17.661 --> 00:00:22.070
hear it, I would hear it back then that he would drug people. Yes, yes, yes.

7
00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:23.870
Yeah, you would hear it. Wow.

8
00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.540
It was like one of those weird rumors that would go around bill Cosby drugs

9
00:00:26.541 --> 00:00:29.690
people. Wow. Dude, it was going on forever.

10
00:00:29.691 --> 00:00:33.830
That's why Hannibal talked about it when Hannibal talked about it on stage and

11
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:38.060
then it all blew up, which is kind of crazy if you know Hannibal, you know guys,

12
00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:41.780
he just happened to be talking about it and then someone happened to be filming

13
00:00:41.781 --> 00:00:44.570
it and then the rest of the world was like, is that true? Is that true?

14
00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.720
Cause bill Cosby's always telling people to not swear and tell him,

15
00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:52.330
especially like he was big on telling young black comedians not swear enough to

16
00:00:52.331 --> 00:00:54.290
talk about sex. And he's like, cause he goes,

17
00:00:54.291 --> 00:00:57.380
bill Cosby only tell now at least I'm out raping people. And everybody's like,

18
00:00:57.381 --> 00:00:57.940
what?

19
00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:58.773
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

20
00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:04.720
That was like the rumor was always around. Yeah, I didn't,

21
00:01:04.721 --> 00:01:09.190
I had heard some creepy, a little creepiness that, but I didn't know.

22
00:01:09.191 --> 00:01:11.770
But it was that extent when someone know

23
00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:15.150
<v 1>when someone does something like that to people, like that's one of the,</v>

24
00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.180
like that's one of the creepiest fucking things a human can do to another human.

25
00:01:20.341 --> 00:01:20.790
Yeah.

26
00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.380
And the idea that this guy who was America's father,

27
00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.350
right. In a lot of ways, he was our black dad. You know,

28
00:01:28.351 --> 00:01:32.700
he was the moral authority. He was, he was mr Huxtable. Yeah. You know,

29
00:01:32.701 --> 00:01:34.770
and then the fact that that guy,

30
00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.840
someone described him as the biggest serial rapist in the history of America,

31
00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.610
like that really might be the case because if he really did drug all these

32
00:01:44.611 --> 00:01:47.580
people that he said he did, like how many people have raped more?

33
00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:48.593
He might be number one,

34
00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:52.840
<v 0>which is crazy. And it's crazy. And the whole time with their hip</v>

35
00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:01.000
[inaudible] yeah. He's the darkest motherfucker ever dark,

36
00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:04.600
dark drug in them. Watching them Plaza. That's fucking,

37
00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:07.480
and he's got kids that's even more fucked up.

38
00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.530
The crazy part when you feel someone else's baby and sticking his Dick in them

39
00:02:11.531 --> 00:02:15.190
while they're unconscious, it's so evil. It's evil.

40
00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:20.170
Now what about Harvey Weinstein? Yeah. Woo woo.

41
00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.460
And he's the one everyone knew about too, apparently. Apparently. Yeah,

42
00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:28.420
that's the um, that's like, that's the cliche, right?

43
00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:32.530
The disgusting boss of the studio that wants you to suck his Dick and I had to

44
00:02:32.531 --> 00:02:36.400
get a role. I know it's funny because you do think like, well,

45
00:02:36.401 --> 00:02:39.460
isn't that kind of why you become like a show business executive?

46
00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.180
Like to get chicks, not to rape chicks. Sexual assault is always off the table,

47
00:02:43.181 --> 00:02:46.840
but, but did he rape them or did, now it's coming out that there's,

48
00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:51.140
there's rape. I tip last I checked today, uh, I know he's,

49
00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:55.240
and he is not a Looker, like he's definitely not cute type of guy.

50
00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:00.100
That would be the type of guy he is, which is what's fucked up. Suicide threat

51
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:03.400
<v 1>prompts. Police response. Whoa. Where there, huh?</v>

52
00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.310
[inaudible] into a fight with his daughter this morning and they had to,

53
00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.300
she called the nine one one damn cause he was going to kill himself or

54
00:03:10.301 --> 00:03:11.050
something. I don't know.

55
00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:16.050
Well he must be so overwhelmed with guilt and fear and remorse and just self

56
00:03:17.681 --> 00:03:22.360
hatred and you know, he sounds like an addict, you know? Yeah.

57
00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:27.040
Yeah. And that he's also probably a power addict. You know,

58
00:03:27.041 --> 00:03:30.490
like he's this guy who's like this gluttonous man.

59
00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:35.370
Like if you look at his physical self, right? His face is over flowing on his

60
00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:41.750
color and he's just gluttonous food. Where's the Coke? Plus

61
00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:46.690
there's this gluttonous existence.

62
00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:49.600
It's not like a measured thought out,

63
00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:54.610
contemplated introspective existence where he's just trying to enjoy his time

64
00:03:54.611 --> 00:03:55.301
here. Like wow,

65
00:03:55.301 --> 00:03:58.480
how lucky I am that I get to do this and make these amazing movies.

66
00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:01.810
You guys were all great. Like that's all I expect from like Steven Spielberg.

67
00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:05.740
I expect Steven Spielberg to be like this really like introspective,

68
00:04:05.741 --> 00:04:09.700
thoughtful guy. I was just enjoying the process of making amazing movies,

69
00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:14.440
but he's, but he's a creative thing. Harvey's an executive guy, right?

70
00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:18.490
He's the guy, the money guy behind everything. And I carve, it's like my deck

71
00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:25.390
is so nasty, so gross. But okay, now on the other hand,

72
00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:27.880
on the other hand, I was like, you know,

73
00:04:27.881 --> 00:04:32.020
Hollywood is such a labyrinth in terms of like getting shit done and getting

74
00:04:32.021 --> 00:04:34.000
deals closed and how did this, does this happen?

75
00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:37.930
It would kind of be nice to be like, you want to Netflix special,

76
00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:42.940
just go fucking suck. And then I could be like, Oh, that's all I have to do.

77
00:04:42.941 --> 00:04:45.490
It's like that guys. Yeah, come over here. You nasty. Fuck.

78
00:04:45.491 --> 00:04:48.430
And then there's a special right.

79
00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:52.900
Way easier would you have to have a conversation with Tommy? Listen Tommy,

80
00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:58.150
this is not sex. This is said job. It's work. Right?

81
00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:01.330
And then it's like cut and dry and it's an exchange. You know,

82
00:05:01.331 --> 00:05:04.330
I was in law school for two weeks and I remember two weeks, two weeks,

83
00:05:04.331 --> 00:05:06.250
and I dropped out in contract law.

84
00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:08.530
It's an exchange of something for something else.

85
00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:12.160
It seems fucking pretty straightforward. Well that's what prostitution is,

86
00:05:12.161 --> 00:05:14.950
right? Which is one of the weirdest things that massage is legal,

87
00:05:14.951 --> 00:05:17.620
but prostitution. Isn't that something? It is.

88
00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:20.290
It is odd because we do not like genital pleasure.

89
00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:22.180
We don't like genital pleasure for cash.

90
00:05:22.181 --> 00:05:25.990
Like general pleasure has to be for love and has to be love and it has to be

91
00:05:25.991 --> 00:05:26.824
given free.

92
00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:31.860
It's the only thing in civilization that we require to be given away for free.

93
00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:37.180
Everything else you can exchange money for exchange money for food. Right.

94
00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:40.930
It's not a prostitution. If someone cooks for you. Right. That's normal.

95
00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:45.100
It's a total normal thing, but it's a very intimate thing. Feeding someone. Yes,

96
00:05:45.101 --> 00:05:47.230
yes, of course. It's loud. A hair salon,

97
00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:49.360
they'll wash your head to give you a head massage.

98
00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:54.150
That's one thing I miss about having hair. I rubbed my head. Ah,

99
00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:01.940
massage or foot massage. People who love foot massage.

100
00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:04.760
I bet there's people out there that like foot massage is one thing like head.

101
00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:07.550
<v 0>Ah, yeah, for sure. For sure. For sure. Right.</v>

102
00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:11.480
But then you put a camera in front of two people fucking,

103
00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:16.480
and now it's legal. So what's well retarded. Yeah. That makes no sense.

104
00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:18.200
Babies. Yeah. We're grown up babies,

105
00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:22.250
but maybe because you can commodify that and that's a capitalistic thing.

106
00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:25.100
Maybe it's more commodifiable as a product.

107
00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:29.870
<v 1>Honestly I think there's two, two factors. One is the tax factor.</v>

108
00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:33.200
It's very difficult to get taxes from people that are prostitutes. Right?

109
00:06:33.201 --> 00:06:35.600
It's like no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, not wait,

110
00:06:35.601 --> 00:06:37.760
where's that money going? Give us. Give us our cut. Yeah.

111
00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:42.830
And then the other thing is the um, sex trafficking,

112
00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:45.380
sex slavery aspect,

113
00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:50.090
like protecting people that are sex traffickers because like, you know,

114
00:06:50.091 --> 00:06:53.960
you could have someone that was sold into sex slavery or you know,

115
00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:56.450
in some way bartered their, you know,

116
00:06:56.480 --> 00:07:00.530
trip to America and had some sort of a sex slave deal.

117
00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:02.000
That's where it gets fucked up.

118
00:07:02.001 --> 00:07:06.530
But there has been arguments that what makes that exist in the first place is

119
00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:10.310
that prostitution is illegal here and a prostitution was legal.

120
00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:12.920
It would be that stuff would all go away.

121
00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:15.830
Much like the argument is with illegal drugs.

122
00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:18.200
Like if you made marijuana illegal,

123
00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:22.940
you wouldn't have as much of the Mexican drug trade, which you are seeing,

124
00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:24.860
you know you are seeing in America.

125
00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:29.740
<v 0>Of course it's retarded and I wait, but wait, Harvey,</v>

126
00:07:29.741 --> 00:07:33.070
he was the guy that would give girls the shoulder rubs.

127
00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:37.040
<v 1>He would tell them to massage him. Oh, he would massage them.</v>

128
00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:40.340
They would massage him. He would do according to these girls.

129
00:07:40.341 --> 00:07:42.470
I don't know if it's true, but he'd be the guy that'd be like,

130
00:07:42.471 --> 00:07:46.280
I'll be right back. And he comes back in a bathrobe. He's a bathrobe guy.

131
00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:48.710
Here's the thing, here's the thing.

132
00:07:48.711 --> 00:07:53.711
I don't mean to make light of anybody's sexual assault or whatever it was or

133
00:07:53.931 --> 00:07:57.980
harassment, but other working on the roof. Again, wonderful. But, but what I,

134
00:07:58.310 --> 00:08:02.510
but here's the thing. How many women said yes, probably a fuck load.

135
00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:07.520
Like that was his move. What we're seeing is his missed pitches. Right, right.

136
00:08:07.521 --> 00:08:10.760
He hit a lot of fucking triples and home runs,

137
00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:12.320
knocked a lot of balls out of the park,

138
00:08:12.321 --> 00:08:16.370
but occasionally he was Wiffen occasionally. He was like,

139
00:08:16.371 --> 00:08:20.330
I got this one in the bag boys. And she's like, fuck off you pig. And he's like,

140
00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:22.970
Oh, come on. Just come back to my room. No, no, no. It's like, shit.

141
00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:27.830
What happened? Harvey wasn't connecting. I wasn't connecting, but listen,

142
00:08:27.831 --> 00:08:28.340
I got all this.

143
00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:32.930
I was just a girl wants to be in the next fucking this movie and avatar 16

144
00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:37.980
<v 0>willing to do the thing to get the part and that's kind of okay. Yeah.</v>

145
00:08:38.010 --> 00:08:39.060
Then dense like that guys,

146
00:08:39.061 --> 00:08:41.070
they can get the part and get your money and get on with it.

147
00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:46.320
<v 1>How many girls read the story when it broke and could still taste the asparagus?</v>

148
00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:51.870
Caviar flavored come just the cocaine and

149
00:08:53.650 --> 00:08:56.010
VOD color in his loads.

150
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.120
<v 0>I bet he has like a Flemmi like moan when he comes.</v>

151
00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:11.250
He's a kind of guy, the white spittle and the corners of his mouth.

152
00:09:11.251 --> 00:09:13.230
When he talks to you, he's try to hit on you.

153
00:09:13.231 --> 00:09:17.400
He's got a little white bubble lip. Oh,

154
00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:21.660
he nasty. He's nasty. Nasty. But that's a gluttonous man.

155
00:09:22.110 --> 00:09:25.320
He's out of control. It's not attractive. It's definitely not. Oh,

156
00:09:25.321 --> 00:09:28.500
my favorite too is that he would jerk off into, did you hear this?

157
00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:32.700
That he plants, Oh he's green.

158
00:09:32.701 --> 00:09:34.680
He wants to exist off of his loads.

159
00:09:34.710 --> 00:09:38.040
But that's such a desperate thing like come over, can we get it? Can I have it?

160
00:09:38.041 --> 00:09:39.480
No. Okay. Stay here then let me,

161
00:09:39.481 --> 00:09:42.900
you know like it's so maybe it was hoping they would just dive on the grenade

162
00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:50.760
of a soldier. But I also like, I was thinking too, like I've,

163
00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:54.720
I've seen so many dudes jerking off in public like homeless guys.

164
00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:59.520
I never got anything for it. Is it, you know, good point.

165
00:09:59.670 --> 00:10:04.440
Yeah. Young guys. Look just the,

166
00:10:05.250 --> 00:10:07.650
here's the thing about male sex versus female sex, right.

167
00:10:07.651 --> 00:10:12.240
Is the accepting part of female sex versus the giving,

168
00:10:12.270 --> 00:10:14.820
like trying to get, take this, take it. Yeah.

169
00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:20.540
And the other thing is that men take it literally are constantly building com

170
00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:24.360
while you're alive, your com is backing up. Yup.

171
00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:28.260
<v 1>So if you're, if you're not like I used to have the bit in my act that was,</v>

172
00:10:28.410 --> 00:10:31.770
it was really based on advice that I used to give friends when they're like,

173
00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:33.460
Ooh, girl wants to get married.

174
00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:38.570
I listen to me jerk off first and then think about it. I give you,

175
00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:40.800
if you're having a hard time with someone and you're,

176
00:10:40.801 --> 00:10:44.700
you don't know what to do and you're going to see them jerk off first and then

177
00:10:44.701 --> 00:10:48.270
see them and then you'll be able to deal with them without any sexual lust,

178
00:10:48.420 --> 00:10:52.200
you won't be make it. ISIS cause me as a PR, as a young man,

179
00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:55.890
this is a real issue with me. When I was in my twenties because I was so horny,

180
00:10:56.010 --> 00:10:58.890
it was like I was a drug addict. So I'd be like,

181
00:10:58.891 --> 00:11:01.680
I'd be like making agreements with myself. Yeah, she's annoying,

182
00:11:01.710 --> 00:11:04.170
but she's going to let me have sex with her. So listen, just,

183
00:11:04.171 --> 00:11:08.610
let's just change our behavior and mold to what she likes and then you'll get to

184
00:11:08.790 --> 00:11:11.700
fuck her is, that's what you need. Like otherwise you'd just be beaten off.

185
00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:15.810
But I remember one time I was supposed to go out with this girl and she was just

186
00:11:15.811 --> 00:11:18.150
so preposterously annoying.

187
00:11:18.570 --> 00:11:22.980
It was so frustrating and she just was always negative. And before we went out,

188
00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:27.090
before I went to go get her, I jerked off and I was sitting there, I was going,

189
00:11:27.091 --> 00:11:29.430
what am I doing? Like I don't even enjoy her company.

190
00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:33.390
Like she's not compatible with me. Like I don't if you can,

191
00:11:33.510 --> 00:11:38.190
if you would just like someone as a person and you like having sex with them,

192
00:11:38.310 --> 00:11:41.490
that's a relationship. But if you only like having sex with them,

193
00:11:41.730 --> 00:11:45.930
you have some sort of a weird barter deal. And that's a lot of men.

194
00:11:46.110 --> 00:11:48.900
A lot of men. And I'm sure a lot of women probably too,

195
00:11:48.901 --> 00:11:53.410
but I can only speak for men like men get involved in these relationships where

196
00:11:53.411 --> 00:11:57.760
you're really just in a relationship so that you have a continuous supply of

197
00:11:57.761 --> 00:12:01.270
sex. Especially when you're young and stupid. When you're 20 years old,

198
00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:04.390
you're basically a monkey. You know, you're, you're just like a little,

199
00:12:04.450 --> 00:12:08.140
a person just trying to fuck and you just try to love her. She's really cool.

200
00:12:08.141 --> 00:12:09.040
And why do you love her?

201
00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:12.040
Cause she smells good cause her tits feel good in your mouth. Like what?

202
00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:14.110
What is really going on? Like,

203
00:12:14.111 --> 00:12:18.130
do you actually enjoy her company as a human being outside of sex?

204
00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:20.230
It doesn't matter, right? Most of the time you don't.

205
00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:25.300
And so if you could just jerk off first and then hang out with someone and you

206
00:12:25.301 --> 00:12:26.350
actually liked them,

207
00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:30.250
like then you have a real relationship like Oh I really like you.

208
00:12:30.310 --> 00:12:34.720
I like you clear out the pipes. Right. You clear out the testosterone.

209
00:12:34.810 --> 00:12:38.980
And I think clearly, yeah, it's super smart. But I think,

210
00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:44.020
I mean I'm just guessing, I've never been a a media mogul,

211
00:12:44.170 --> 00:12:48.370
but I would imagine there's a bunch of factors going on. First of all,

212
00:12:48.371 --> 00:12:52.930
there's a bunch of people that are constantly kissing his ass and rubbing.

213
00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:57.820
Like I saw a picture of him with Renee Zellweger and Renee Zellweger was like

214
00:12:57.821 --> 00:13:01.630
cuddling up with him and she had her hand on him and he had his arm on her and

215
00:13:01.631 --> 00:13:04.900
there was like some other celebrity to his right and there were like Yuk Yuk Yuk

216
00:13:04.910 --> 00:13:08.500
it up. But he was like pawn her. He had a hold of her.

217
00:13:08.710 --> 00:13:12.190
And I would imagine that there's all these people that recognize that he's this

218
00:13:12.191 --> 00:13:14.890
like epicenter of power and success.

219
00:13:15.070 --> 00:13:20.070
And you want Harvey Weinstein of Mira max to love you and you would get close to

220
00:13:21.281 --> 00:13:24.790
him and you have a couple of drinks and you're doing Coke together. Yeah,

221
00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:25.390
look at that.

222
00:13:25.390 --> 00:13:30.390
She's got her hand on his leg and he's got Russell Crowe to his right and Renee

223
00:13:30.550 --> 00:13:32.290
Zellweger to his left and she's smiling.

224
00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:36.460
They're probably hammered and everyone's on Xanax. Next thing you know,

225
00:13:36.610 --> 00:13:39.710
he's got his Dick in her butt. That's crazy, dude.

226
00:13:39.830 --> 00:13:43.660
She's like imagining that diary number two, number six.

227
00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:45.640
I don't know if that really happened,

228
00:13:45.910 --> 00:13:50.110
but my point is that it's not just that he was predatory,

229
00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:54.880
it was also that he lived, I'm just guessing. Okay.

230
00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:56.890
I'm not an apologist folks,

231
00:13:57.220 --> 00:14:02.220
but I would imagine that he lived in this world where he was like royalty.

232
00:14:02.741 --> 00:14:06.850
He was essentially like the King of this empire. Right.

233
00:14:06.910 --> 00:14:10.030
So you had all these employees is one of the articles that I read today,

234
00:14:10.390 --> 00:14:13.960
I think it was from the Telegraph where this guy was saying that, um,

235
00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:18.550
he was at a party or one of his friends was at a party and uh,

236
00:14:18.790 --> 00:14:20.830
they were having a conversation with, uh,

237
00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:25.870
this girl who worked for Harvey and Harvey just said her name from across the

238
00:14:25.871 --> 00:14:30.460
room and her face went pale and she immediately just ran away from him to run to

239
00:14:30.461 --> 00:14:34.090
her. Like didn't say, excuse me, I'll be right back. Just ran at a fear.

240
00:14:34.870 --> 00:14:39.340
Who knows? That is obvious. Could he be interpretation after the fact?

241
00:14:39.610 --> 00:14:42.970
It could be exaggeration of what the actual circumstances were to fit a

242
00:14:42.971 --> 00:14:43.804
narrative,

243
00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:48.610
but you got to imagine that this guy is just multi-multi millionaire,

244
00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:52.070
just orgiastic gluttonous

245
00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:53.900
<v 0>job of the hut, motherfucker.</v>

246
00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:58.370
Just getting us to socked and just [inaudible] we're going to be the biggest,

247
00:14:58.650 --> 00:14:59.483
the biggest driver.

248
00:15:02.270 --> 00:15:05.720
And then there's also these girls that he can't get and he's like close to them,

249
00:15:05.721 --> 00:15:09.410
close to them. That's the anger, right? Listen Christina,

250
00:15:09.411 --> 00:15:13.370
I think you're the one that got his hand on you. One of the best.

251
00:15:14.210 --> 00:15:16.610
Come into my room. Let's talk about this. I've got a proposal,

252
00:15:16.611 --> 00:15:19.230
I've got a proposal. He come up to his room and he's got a bathrobe on.

253
00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:23.660
You're like, what is there? Just give me a massage and my neck is tense.

254
00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:29.330
You're like, Coke, what about cocaine? Caviar, cocaine, caviar together. So

255
00:15:32.660 --> 00:15:36.380
that is, he is unbelievably the him and I have to say,

256
00:15:36.381 --> 00:15:39.740
and I know Hugh Hefner was a big mogul and he did a lot of cool shit.

257
00:15:40.310 --> 00:15:41.510
Not for me.

258
00:15:41.511 --> 00:15:46.340
That would be a tough gig to like living in the mansion and being one of the

259
00:15:46.341 --> 00:15:49.490
girls like come over for movie night, you know,

260
00:15:49.491 --> 00:15:53.480
and he's in his pajamas and you know that he butts sex them because he don't

261
00:15:53.481 --> 00:15:56.750
want to get anyone pregnant. That's the trick. That's what I read.

262
00:15:56.990 --> 00:16:00.740
And what does it, Holly, Holly Madison wrote, but I wrote a book.

263
00:16:00.770 --> 00:16:03.320
Is that her fucking name? Dolly Madison's the pastry.

264
00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:05.990
Like who the fuck is,

265
00:16:06.410 --> 00:16:10.280
he bought sex them so that they didn't have to worry about birth controls?

266
00:16:10.310 --> 00:16:10.820
Correct.

267
00:16:10.820 --> 00:16:15.080
And then there's a lot of like he would make the girls make out in front of him

268
00:16:15.290 --> 00:16:17.660
and then he would masturbate too. It's also kind of,

269
00:16:17.661 --> 00:16:21.350
I think is a way of avoiding possible pregnancies. Wow.

270
00:16:21.410 --> 00:16:26.210
So you've probably developed a strategy of a years of like ducking pregnancies.

271
00:16:26.870 --> 00:16:29.210
Wow. That's, that's a weird thing to write,

272
00:16:29.211 --> 00:16:33.860
to like be putting yourself out there as this person with a lot of money who

273
00:16:33.861 --> 00:16:35.780
really likes young girls and the young girls go,

274
00:16:35.810 --> 00:16:38.510
all I have to do is catch one load.

275
00:16:38.990 --> 00:16:40.870
It's all at the right time.

276
00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:44.960
Stories about athletes that girls put holes in the condoms or the girl girls

277
00:16:44.961 --> 00:16:47.990
take the condoms out of the trash and squirt them into their pussy.

278
00:16:50.060 --> 00:16:54.410
Imagine. How was I born, mommy? Well,

279
00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:57.950
it's a lovely story. Umami. Umami took a condom,

280
00:16:58.700 --> 00:17:03.290
like one of them pastry bags and squirted that fucker in there.

281
00:17:05.540 --> 00:17:08.210
Well, your mother fish to fill the condom out of the trash.

282
00:17:08.900 --> 00:17:11.840
I threw it in the toilet, tended to throw it in the toilet,

283
00:17:12.050 --> 00:17:15.650
but I had one saved in my mouth. Spit that one in the toilet.

284
00:17:15.651 --> 00:17:16.850
And that's why you're alive.

285
00:17:25.350 --> 00:17:25.350
<v 2>[inaudible].</v>
