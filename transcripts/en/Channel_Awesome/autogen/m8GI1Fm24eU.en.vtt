I think it's it's always good pointing
 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:52.150 align:start position:0%
I think it's it's always good pointing

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:52.160 align:start position:0%
out when that's done so well that you
 

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:54.420 align:start position:0%
out when that's done so well that you
kind<00:04:52.400><c> of</c><00:04:52.520><c> don't</c><00:04:52.670><c> notice</c><00:04:53.030><c> that</c><00:04:53.210><c> checklist</c><00:04:53.570><c> uh</c>

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:00.890 align:start position:0%
