Speaker 1:          00:00          Hello, I'm busy getting animated about language and this is why you should join me. We've been digging into the decipherment of ancient scripts in some languages out there. People sing when they speak. So how does that work? It's the U S is 50th state and one of the most popular tropical vacation destinations in the world. But how do you say it's name? Did you know that bees are out there talking to each other right now? Storytellers of old knew how to spin tales with monsters and ghosts like in Homer's odyssey, spirit possession and lady Murasaki's tale of Genji or even spooky settings as dog days in Ferno, ancient Sanskrit. Turn that dial 1000 years into the future. What will future English be like.
