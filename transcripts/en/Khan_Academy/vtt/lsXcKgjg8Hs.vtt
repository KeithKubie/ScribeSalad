00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:03.990
Let's do another states of
matter phase change problem.

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:05.280
And we'll deal with
water again.

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:08.340
But this one hopefully will
stretch our neurons a little

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:09.360
bit further.

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.205
So let's say I have 500
grams of water.

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:20.710
Of liquid water.

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:25.420
At 60 degrees Celsius.

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:29.170
Now my goal is to get it to
zero degrees Celsius.

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:32.670
And the way I'm going to do it
is, I'm going to put ice into

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:34.480
this 500 grams of water.

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:39.070
And my ice machine at home makes
ice that comes out of

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:44.480
the machine at minus 10
degrees Celsius ice.

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.710
And my question is, exactly
how much ice do I need?

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:51.690
So how much, or how
many grams of ice?

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:00.140
And I'm going to take the ice
out of the freezer and just

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:01.490
plop it into my liquid.

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:05.890
How much do I need to bring this
liquid, this 500 grams of

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:10.870
liquid water, down
to zero degrees?

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:13.970
So the idea, if we just
imagine a cup here.

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:15.800
Let me draw a cup.

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.270
This is a cup.

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:21.130
I have some 60 degree
water in there.

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:24.580
I'm going to plunk a big
chunk of ice in there.

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:31.350
And what's going to happen is
that heat from the water is

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:32.250
going to go into the ice.

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:38.140
So the ice is going to absorb
heat from the water.

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.890
So in order for water to go
from 60 degrees to zero

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.040
degrees, I have to extract
heat out of it.

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.260
And we're about to figure
out just how much heat.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.620
And so we have to say, whatever
was extracted out of

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:50.760
the water, essentially has to
be contained by the ice.

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:53.320
And the ice can't get
above zero degrees.

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.150
Essentially, that amount of
ice has to absorb all that

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:58.180
heat to go from minus
10 to zero.

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:01.780
And then also, that energy will
be used to melt it a bit.

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.230
But if we don't have enough ice,
then the ice is going to

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:06.310
go beyond that and then
warm up even more.

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:08.009
So let's see how we do this.

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.380
So how much energy do we have
to take out of the 500 grams

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:12.680
of liquid water?

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.570
Well, it's the same amount of
energy that it would take to

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:16.540
put into zero degrees
liquid water and

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.150
get it to 60 degrees.

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.180
So we're talking about
a 50 degree change.

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:29.150
So the energy or the heat out
of the water is going to be

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:46.060
the specific heat of water,
4.178 joules per grams Kelvin.

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.330
And I have to multiply that
times the number of grams of

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:52.090
water I have to cool down, I
have to take the heat out of.

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:57.330
And we know that's 500 grams.
And then I multiply that times

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.680
the temperature differential
that we care about.

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.260
And just a side note, I use
this specific heat because

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:03.560
we're dealing with
liquid water.

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.540
Liquid water going
from 60 to zero.

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:10.590
So the final thing, I have to
multiply it by the change in

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:11.050
temperature.

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:13.350
The change in temperature
is 60 degrees.

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:18.450
Times 60 degrees.

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:21.410
There's a little button on the
side of my pen, when I press

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:23.900
it by accident sometimes it
does that weird thing.

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.110
So let's see what this is.

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:37.780
So this is 4.178 times 500 times
change of 60 degrees.

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.040
It could be a change of 60
degrees Kelvin or a change of

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:40.960
60 degrees Celsius.

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:41.600
It doesn't matter.

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.100
The actual difference is the
same, whether we're doing

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:45.840
Kelvin or Celsius.

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:57.130
And it's 125,340 joules.

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:59.340
So this is the amount of heat
that you have to take out of

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:02.450
60 degree water in order to get
it down to zero degrees.

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:06.110
Or the amount of heat you have
to add to zero degree water to

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:07.920
get it to 60 degrees.

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:14.300
So essentially, our ice has
to absorb this much energy

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:16.779
without going above
zero degrees.

00:04:16.779 --> 00:04:20.060
So how much energy can
the ice absorb?

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:21.149
Well let's set a variable.

00:04:21.149 --> 00:04:22.940
The question is how much ice.

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:27.350
So let's set our variable,
maybe we'll call it I.

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:30.370
Let's do x. x is always
the unknown variable.

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:37.030
So we're going to have
x grams of ice.

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:39.960
OK, and it starts at
minus 10 degrees.

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:45.530
So when this x grams of ice
warms from minus 10 degrees to

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:49.405
zero degrees Celsius, how much
energy will it be absorbing?

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:58.140
So to go from minus 10 degrees
Celsius to zero degrees

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:02.450
Celsius, the heat that's
absorbed by the ice is equal

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:11.420
to-- is equal to the specific
heat of ice, ice water, 2.05

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:19.690
joules per gram Kelvin, times
the amount of ice.

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:20.830
That's what we're solving for.

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:23.050
So times x.

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:25.150
Times the change
in temperature.

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:28.230
So this is a 10 degree change
in Celsius degrees, which is

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:31.090
also a 10 degree change
in Kelvin degrees.

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:32.730
We can just do 10 degrees.

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:35.850
I could write Kelvin here, just
because at least when I

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:38.670
wrote the specific heat units,
I have a Kelvin in the

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:38.840
denominator.

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:40.760
It could have been a Celsius,
but just to

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:41.960
make them cancel out.

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:44.880
This is, of course, x grams.
So the grams cancel out.

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:48.440
So that heat absorbed to go from
minus 10 degree ice to

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:55.220
zero degree ice is 2.05
times 10 is 20.5.

00:05:55.220 --> 00:06:03.890
So it's 20.5 times x joules.

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:06.550
This is to go from minus 10
degrees to zero degrees.

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:08.780
Now, once we're at zero degrees,
the ice can even

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:12.120
absorb more energy before
increasing in

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:13.980
temperature as it melts.

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:17.950
Remember, when I drew that
phase change diagram.

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:20.250
The ice gains some energy
and then it

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:22.260
levels out as it melts.

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:26.720
As the the bonds, the hydrogen
bonds start sliding past each

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:29.360
other, and the crystalline
structure breaks down.

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:30.540
So this is the amount
of energy the

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:31.790
ice can also absorb.

00:06:34.815 --> 00:06:36.880
Let me do it in a
different color.

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:42.430
Zero degree ice to zero--
I did it again--

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:43.983
to zero degree water.

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:51.680
Well the heat absorbed now
is going to be the heat

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:53.300
of fusion of ice.

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:55.510
Or the melting heat,
either one.

00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:59.730
That's 333 joules per gram.

00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:05.760
It's equal to 333.55 joules per
gram times the number of

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:08.090
grams we have. Once
again, that's x

00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:09.770
grams. They cancel out.

00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:18.580
So the ice will absorb 333.55
joules as it goes from zero

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:22.510
degree ice to zero
degree water.

00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:25.453
Or 333.55x joules.

00:07:25.453 --> 00:07:27.690
Let me put the x there,
that's key.

00:07:27.690 --> 00:07:30.970
So the total amount of heat
that the ice can absorb

00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:32.660
without going above
zero degrees.

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:35.100
Because once it's at zero degree
water, as you put more

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:38.800
heat into it, it's going to
start getting warmer again.

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:41.080
If the ice gets above zero
degrees, there's no way it's

00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:43.020
going to bring the water
down to zero degrees.

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:48.340
The water can't get above
zero degrees.

00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:51.280
So how much total heat
can our ice absorb?

00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:56.440
So heat absorbed is equal to the
heat it can absorb when it

00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:59.400
goes from minus 10 to
zero degrees ice.

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:02.950
And that's 20.5x.

00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:06.950
Where x is the number of grams
of ice we have. Plus the

00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:09.970
amount of heat we can absorb as
we go from zero degree ice

00:08:09.970 --> 00:08:11.600
to zero degree water.

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:16.155
And that's 333.55x.

00:08:16.155 --> 00:08:17.500
And of course, all of
this is joules.

00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:20.860
So this is the total amount of
heat that the ice can absorb

00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:24.270
without going above
zero degrees.

00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:26.520
Now, how much real energy
does it have to absorb?

00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:32.289
Well it has to absorb all of
this 125,340 joules of energy

00:08:32.289 --> 00:08:33.070
out of the water.

00:08:33.070 --> 00:08:35.360
Because that's the amount of
energy we have to extract from

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:38.120
the water to bring it down
to zero degrees.

00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:42.820
So the amount of energy
the ice absorbs

00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:46.690
has to be this 125,340.

00:08:46.690 --> 00:08:53.200
So that has to be equal
to 125,340 joules.

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:55.380
We can do a little bit
of algebra here.

00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:56.640
Add these two things.

00:08:56.640 --> 00:09:10.670
20.5x plus 333.55x is 354.05x.

00:09:10.670 --> 00:09:11.470
Is that right?

00:09:11.470 --> 00:09:14.370
Yeah, 330 plus 30 is 350.

00:09:14.370 --> 00:09:16.310
Then you have a 3 with
a 0.5 there.

00:09:16.310 --> 00:09:20.960
354.05x and that is equal to the
amount of energy we take

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:22.500
out of the water.

00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:23.750
You divide both sides.

00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:31.590
So x is equal to 125,340
divided by 354.05.

00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:33.210
I'll take out the calculator
for this.

00:09:37.210 --> 00:09:43.010
The calculator tells me 125,340,
the amount of energy

00:09:43.010 --> 00:09:53.770
that has to be absorbed by the
ice, divided by 354.05 is

00:09:53.770 --> 00:09:58.960
equal to 354 grams. Roughly;
there's a little bit extra.

00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:01.700
So actually, just to be careful
maybe I'll take 355

00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:02.360
grams of ice.

00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:05.020
Because I definitely want
my water to be chilled.

00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:12.980
So our answer is x is equal
to 354.02 grams of ice.

00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:13.900
So this is interesting.

00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:16.860
I had 500 grams of liquid.

00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:19.120
And you know, intuitively I
said, well if I have to bring

00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:22.660
that down to zero degrees, I'd
have to have a ton of ice.

00:10:22.660 --> 00:10:27.220
But it turns out, I only need,
what was the exact number?

00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:31.960
So the liquid is 500 grams.
About, roughly half a pound,

00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:33.930
if you want to get a sense for
how much 500 grams is.

00:10:33.930 --> 00:10:36.920
A kilogram is 2.2 pounds.

00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:39.080
So this ice is 354.

00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:42.010
So you actually have to have
less ice than water.

00:10:42.010 --> 00:10:44.220
Which is interesting, because
it seems like the ice isn't

00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:45.760
making that big of a
temperature change.

00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:48.650
The ice is only going from
minus 10 to zero degrees.

00:10:48.650 --> 00:10:51.870
While the water is going all
the way from 60 degrees to

00:10:51.870 --> 00:10:52.570
zero degrees.

00:10:52.570 --> 00:10:54.130
So you're like, how does
that work out?

00:10:54.130 --> 00:10:57.340
And the reason is because so
much energy can be absorbed by

00:10:57.340 --> 00:11:02.410
the ice in the form of potential
energy as it melts.

00:11:02.410 --> 00:11:04.740
So if you talk about all the
energy that the ice is

00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:06.910
asborbing, most of it is
due to the heat of

00:11:06.910 --> 00:11:09.920
fusion right there.

00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:12.630
You can actually have zero
degree ice and it can still

00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:17.020
absorb this huge amount of
energy just by melting it.

00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:19.140
Without even changing
its temperature.

00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:22.700
Anyway, hopefully you found
that reasonably useful.
