00:00:01.048 --> 00:00:04.762
- [Voiceover] So I have here
a three-dimensional graph,

00:00:04.762 --> 00:00:05.999
and that means that it's representing

00:00:05.999 --> 00:00:07.545
some kind of function that has

00:00:07.545 --> 00:00:10.743
a two-dimensional input
and a one-dimension output.

00:00:10.743 --> 00:00:14.326
So that might look
something like f of x, y

00:00:15.489 --> 00:00:17.396
equals and then just some

00:00:17.396 --> 00:00:20.359
expression that has a
bunch of x's and y's in it.

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:21.471
And graphs are great

00:00:21.471 --> 00:00:23.471
but they're kinda clunky to draw.

00:00:23.471 --> 00:00:25.395
I mean, certainly you can't
just scribble it down.

00:00:25.395 --> 00:00:28.240
It typically requires some
kind of graphing software

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:29.702
and when you take a static image of it

00:00:29.702 --> 00:00:31.792
it's not always clear what's going on.

00:00:31.792 --> 00:00:33.743
So here I'm going to
describe a way that you can

00:00:33.743 --> 00:00:37.144
represent these functions and
these graphs two-dimensionally

00:00:37.144 --> 00:00:40.581
just by scribbling down on a
two-dimensional piece of paper.

00:00:40.581 --> 00:00:43.156
This is a very common way
that you'll see if you're

00:00:43.156 --> 00:00:46.085
reading a textbook or if someone
is drawing on a blackboard.

00:00:46.085 --> 00:00:48.209
It's known as a contour plot

00:00:48.209 --> 00:00:49.799
and the idea of a contour plot

00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:51.132
is that we're going to take this graph

00:00:51.132 --> 00:00:53.096
and slice it a bunch of times.

00:00:53.096 --> 00:00:55.060
So I'm going to slice
it with various planes

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:58.903
that are all parallel to the x, y plane

00:00:58.903 --> 00:01:00.169
and let's think for a moment

00:01:00.169 --> 00:01:02.349
about what these guys represent.

00:01:02.349 --> 00:01:04.650
So the bottom one here

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.650
represents the value z
is equal to negative two.

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:11.781
This is the z-axis over here

00:01:11.781 --> 00:01:13.664
and when we fix that to be negative two

00:01:13.664 --> 00:01:16.940
and let x and y run freely
we get this whole plane.

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:20.549
And if you let z increase,
keep it constant,

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.504
but let it increase by one to negative one

00:01:22.504 --> 00:01:26.671
we get a new plane, still
parallel to the x, y plane

00:01:28.668 --> 00:01:31.318
but it's distance from the
x, y plane is negative one.

00:01:31.318 --> 00:01:32.173
And the rest of these guys,

00:01:32.173 --> 00:01:35.829
they're all still constant values of z.

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:38.344
Now in terms of our graph,

00:01:38.344 --> 00:01:39.268
what that means is that

00:01:39.268 --> 00:01:44.175
these represent constant
values of the graph itself.

00:01:44.175 --> 00:01:47.185
These represent constant
values for the function itself.

00:01:47.185 --> 00:01:49.685
So because we always represent
the output of the function

00:01:49.685 --> 00:01:52.122
as the height off of the x, y plane

00:01:52.122 --> 00:01:56.039
these represent constant
values for the output.

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.650
What that's going to look like.

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:02.167
So what we do

00:02:02.167 --> 00:02:05.751
is we say, "Where do these
slices cut into the graph?"

00:02:05.751 --> 00:02:08.127
So I'm going to draw on all of the points

00:02:08.127 --> 00:02:09.916
where those slices cut into the graph

00:02:09.916 --> 00:02:11.889
and these are called contour lines.

00:02:11.889 --> 00:02:12.957
We're still in three-dimensions

00:02:12.957 --> 00:02:15.349
so we're not done yet.

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:18.017
So what I'm going to do is
take all these contour lines

00:02:18.017 --> 00:02:21.456
and I'm going to squish them
down on to the x, y plane.

00:02:21.456 --> 00:02:23.638
So what that means,

00:02:23.638 --> 00:02:26.750
each of them has some kind
of z component at the moment,

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:28.632
and we're just going to chop it down,

00:02:28.632 --> 00:02:31.132
squish them all nice and flat,

00:02:31.998 --> 00:02:34.204
on to the x, y plane.

00:02:34.204 --> 00:02:36.885
And now we have something two-dimensional,

00:02:36.885 --> 00:02:38.069
and it still represents

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:39.614
some of the outputs of our function.

00:02:39.614 --> 00:02:41.041
Not all of them, it's not perfect,

00:02:41.041 --> 00:02:43.941
but it does give a very good idea.

00:02:43.941 --> 00:02:46.745
I'm going to switch over to
a two-dimensional graph here.

00:02:46.745 --> 00:02:48.845
And this is that same

00:02:48.845 --> 00:02:51.162
function that we were just looking at.

00:02:51.162 --> 00:02:55.042
Let's actually move it a
little bit more central here.

00:02:55.042 --> 00:02:56.400
So this is the same function

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.150
that we were just looking at, but

00:03:00.584 --> 00:03:01.546
each of these lines represents

00:03:01.546 --> 00:03:03.490
a constant output of the function

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:04.802
so it's important to realize

00:03:04.802 --> 00:03:07.208
we're still representing

00:03:07.208 --> 00:03:09.665
a function that has a
two-dimensional input

00:03:09.665 --> 00:03:11.051
and a one-dimensional output.

00:03:11.051 --> 00:03:13.237
It's just that we're
looking in the input space

00:03:13.237 --> 00:03:14.658
of that function as a whole.

00:03:14.658 --> 00:03:16.663
So this is still

00:03:16.663 --> 00:03:17.496
f of x, y

00:03:19.954 --> 00:03:22.655
and then some expression of those guys

00:03:22.655 --> 00:03:26.099
but this line might represent
the constant value of f

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:29.559
when all of the values
were at outputs three.

00:03:29.559 --> 00:03:31.716
Over here, this also,

00:03:31.716 --> 00:03:33.239
both of these circles together give you

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:35.771
all the values where f outputs three.

00:03:35.771 --> 00:03:37.917
This one over here

00:03:37.917 --> 00:03:39.355
will tell you where it outputs two

00:03:39.355 --> 00:03:41.665
and you can't know this just
looking at the contour plot

00:03:41.665 --> 00:03:43.459
so typically if someone's drawing it

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:46.185
if it matters that you
know the specific values

00:03:46.185 --> 00:03:47.734
they'll mark it somehow.

00:03:47.734 --> 00:03:51.357
They'll let you know what
value each line corresponds to

00:03:51.357 --> 00:03:53.901
but as soon as you know that
this line corresponds to zero

00:03:53.901 --> 00:03:56.432
it tells you that every
possible input point

00:03:56.432 --> 00:03:58.157
that sits somewhere on this line

00:03:58.157 --> 00:04:01.583
will evaluate to zero when you
pump it through the function.

00:04:01.583 --> 00:04:03.049
And this actually gives a very good feel

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:04.759
for the shape of things.

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:06.474
If you like thinking in terms of graphs

00:04:06.474 --> 00:04:08.049
you can kind of imagine how

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:11.107
these circles and everything
would pop out of the page.

00:04:11.107 --> 00:04:11.940
You can also look,

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.659
notice how the lines are really
close together over here,

00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:15.637
very, very close together,

00:04:15.637 --> 00:04:18.034
but they're a little
more spaced over here.

00:04:18.034 --> 00:04:20.460
How do you interpret that?

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:24.977
Well, over here this means it
takes a very, very small step

00:04:24.977 --> 00:04:27.717
to increase the value
of the function by one,

00:04:27.717 --> 00:04:29.865
very small step and it increases by one,

00:04:29.865 --> 00:04:32.082
but over here it takes a much larger step

00:04:32.082 --> 00:04:34.534
to increase the function
by the same value.

00:04:34.534 --> 00:04:36.935
So over here this kind of means steepness.

00:04:36.935 --> 00:04:40.328
If you see a very short
distance between contour lines

00:04:40.328 --> 00:04:41.527
it's going to be very steep

00:04:41.527 --> 00:04:44.181
but over here it's much more shallow.

00:04:44.181 --> 00:04:46.311
And you can do things like this
to kind of get a better feel

00:04:46.311 --> 00:04:47.885
for the function as whole.

00:04:47.885 --> 00:04:49.846
The idea of a whole bunch
of concentric circles

00:04:49.846 --> 00:04:53.689
usually corresponds to
a maximum or a minimum,

00:04:53.689 --> 00:04:55.219
and you end up seeing these a lot.

00:04:55.219 --> 00:04:57.219
Another common

00:04:57.219 --> 00:04:59.603
thing people will do with contour plots

00:04:59.603 --> 00:05:01.756
as they represent them is color them.

00:05:01.756 --> 00:05:04.022
So what that might look like

00:05:04.022 --> 00:05:05.636
is here where

00:05:05.636 --> 00:05:09.142
warmer colors like orange
correspond to high values

00:05:09.142 --> 00:05:13.329
and cooler colors like blue
correspond to low values.

00:05:13.329 --> 00:05:15.869
The contour lines end up going along

00:05:15.869 --> 00:05:17.908
the division between red and green here,

00:05:17.908 --> 00:05:20.104
between light green and green,

00:05:20.104 --> 00:05:21.740
and that's another way were

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:23.855
colors tell you the output and then

00:05:23.855 --> 00:05:25.585
the contour lines
themselves can be thought of

00:05:25.585 --> 00:05:28.755
as the borders between different colors.

00:05:28.755 --> 00:05:30.169
And again a good way to get a feel

00:05:30.169 --> 00:05:31.690
for a multi-dimensional function

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:34.607
just by looking at the input space.
