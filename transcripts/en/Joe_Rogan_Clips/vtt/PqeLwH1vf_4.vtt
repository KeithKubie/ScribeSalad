1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.390
I know you don't listen.
I think if you never talked about Sandy Hook,

2
00:00:03.391 --> 00:00:06.810
you'd have no problems.
I really do believe that.
I believe there'd be problems.

3
00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.320
I think people would look down on you and call you a right wing lunatic and all

4
00:00:10.321 --> 00:00:12.120
sorts of other things,
which they don't even know.

5
00:00:12.121 --> 00:00:13.740
When I knew you when I first knew you,

6
00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.550
you were getting arrested for going after George Bush.
I remember when George,

7
00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.710
you are not a right one guy.
Ask Him a question.
He had me rush.
Well you,
yeah.

8
00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:24.340
Were you were asking him a pertinent question about the CFR in his dad's drug.

9
00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.340
Yes,
exactly.
Exactly.

10
00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.580
And this was a guy that was running for president as a Republican and you,

11
00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:33.930
you were getting arrested for questioning and contra the CFR.

12
00:00:33.931 --> 00:00:37.890
But my point is you weren't,
you weren't a tie to a party.

13
00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.300
You were trying to find the truth.
And I,
when I,
when I aligned with Trump,

14
00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.530
that's when all hell broke loose.
Yeah,
yeah.
That was part of it.

15
00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.340
I think that was definitely Hillary admits.
She looked at my whole bio and shit.

16
00:00:50.341 --> 00:00:53.600
Shani Hook,
hit him on that right now.
Uh,

17
00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:55.530
do juice still communicate with Trump?

18
00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.930
Not In a while and I shot it becomes a big issue.

19
00:01:00.931 --> 00:01:03.660
I mean I obviously communicate with surrogates should people that talk to Trump,

20
00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.270
I mean don jr was on Tucker Carlson last night.

21
00:01:06.271 --> 00:01:09.270
They were talking about Ma'am saying what happened was wrong and the fact that

22
00:01:09.271 --> 00:01:13.390
they've used me as the way to start the casual society and then,
and then,

23
00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:16.140
and then I'm gonna Imagine are never supposed to block somebody from banking if

24
00:01:16.141 --> 00:01:19.620
they have a good record,
it's not fraud.
Here's a whole other story.

25
00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.490
I had an a plus plus rating with my shopping cart and bank accounts that I had

26
00:01:25.501 --> 00:01:29.400
for 22 years and banks looked at it and said,

27
00:01:29.401 --> 00:01:32.070
we've quite frankly never seen anybody with a credit rating.

28
00:01:32.071 --> 00:01:35.160
The shy cause you'd ever even do chargebacks with our shopping cart.

29
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.750
People do that.
What does that mean?
Chargebacks point is we have the best credit.

30
00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.840
There is a group out of Boston,

31
00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.700
which I'm not going to mention here for your show and things,

32
00:01:44.701 --> 00:01:49.530
but we're preparing litigation against who does the ratings to she grit rating

33
00:01:49.531 --> 00:01:52.920
system for like Taliban al Qaeda,
the Mafia that's,

34
00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:56.610
that's given a bank executives two days before paypal bandage,

35
00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.150
they put a hate designation for the southern poverty law center.

36
00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.230
Shang I'm basically a terrorist so when they call you a hate personality,

37
00:02:04.231 --> 00:02:07.590
it needs a terrorist in Interpol show all over the western world.

38
00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.330
I am listed and we would sent documents out of England and out of the u s that

39
00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:14.550
we were sent this by High Level Bank of people that are freaked out.

40
00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.950
We make contacts,
lawyers checks that they can't believe it.

41
00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.790
They have designated me as an international terrorist and that's how they took

42
00:02:20.791 --> 00:02:25.791
five of my six bank accounts and got me down to one bank account with perfect

43
00:02:26.281 --> 00:02:27.620
credit Shang.

44
00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:32.550
You cannot take money on your shopping cart and forced to.com for your products,

45
00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.330
t shirts,
books,
whatever.
You,

46
00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:37.260
you aren't allowed to be in commerce because you are a terrorist.

47
00:02:37.261 --> 00:02:40.800
And what do they use to define terrorist h?

48
00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.900
It's classified symbols and we got some of the documents is hate,
h is hate.

49
00:02:45.901 --> 00:02:50.310
And then just let me just decide arbitrarily that you're a hateful person that

50
00:02:50.311 --> 00:02:54.510
you promote hate.
No judge,
no jury.
It's the global Chinese social score.

51
00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.300
That's what they're all testing for here.
But this is what we were talking about.

52
00:02:57.301 --> 00:02:58.920
That's very important.
This is actually,

53
00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:03.370
this is actually dangerous to give people the ability to define people without

54
00:03:03.371 --> 00:03:07.390
any strict rigid qualifications,
without anything that you can point to on paper.

55
00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:11.000
If I was a convicted murderer and got out of prison,
I started online storage,

56
00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:15.910
sell t shirts,
right?
If I was Charlie Manson,
he had like four TV specials on,
on,

57
00:03:15.911 --> 00:03:20.680
on,
you know,
uh,
CBS on 60 minutes and I was a kid.
I watched Charlie Manson.

58
00:03:20.681 --> 00:03:22.300
I don't think he was allowed to get paid for those though.

59
00:03:22.301 --> 00:03:25.330
I think that was part of the thing because he's involved in,
well,
we'll share,

60
00:03:25.331 --> 00:03:27.490
they have laws on that.
But the point is he would do her all the reverse shows.

61
00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:29.260
The point is Hitler.

62
00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:31.960
Basically it was the number one thing on the history channel when they first

63
00:03:31.961 --> 00:03:35.620
launched it so you can hear what Hitler has to say even though we know he's a

64
00:03:35.621 --> 00:03:37.460
bad guy.
Well why can't you read Alex Challenge?

65
00:03:37.461 --> 00:03:41.350
I have to say because they have found what I talk about as effective.

66
00:03:41.351 --> 00:03:44.380
It gets people thinking and they want it shut down because we've,

67
00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:47.050
we've relaunched populism,
Info wars has done this.

68
00:03:47.051 --> 00:03:52.051
My audience has 1776 worldwide populism,

69
00:03:52.211 --> 00:03:56.350
anti globalism,
anti-communism anti China and the big tech companies,

70
00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:02.550
Google and apple and all of them have publicly moved to China and they publicly

71
00:04:02.861 --> 00:04:04.870
agreed the sensor and control the population.

72
00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:08.320
This is in the nose and that's why Tim Cook got so mad at me and I made a huge

73
00:04:08.321 --> 00:04:10.600
issue to Trump and I shouldn't report to the president.

74
00:04:10.601 --> 00:04:14.410
I know he got and that that's what happened on that Sunday night when they said

75
00:04:14.411 --> 00:04:15.730
that's it,
we're done with Jones.

76
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.980
We have to take him down because I got investigations going at the national

77
00:04:20.981 --> 00:04:23.430
security level,
sending big reports,

78
00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:28.450
the president through law firms of Reuters and AP and then the articles which he

79
00:04:28.961 --> 00:04:33.961
wasn't getting where China has given the code keys by apple just last year,

80
00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:34.721
uh,

81
00:04:34.721 --> 00:04:37.720
and is moving their database there and all the code keys have been given to the

82
00:04:37.721 --> 00:04:39.470
Chinese government.
And Apple says,

83
00:04:39.471 --> 00:04:42.970
I just part of being there and Google's building dragon fly project help since

84
00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.100
the entire population with a social credit score.

85
00:04:45.101 --> 00:04:47.470
They're already testing in Venezuela with China and they're going to bring it

86
00:04:47.471 --> 00:04:50.620
here and everything you do in live time will be controlled.
And you know,

87
00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:53.620
all the big airlines now are putting cameras in that watch you while you're on

88
00:04:53.621 --> 00:04:56.620
the airplane.
Let me stop you because you rent.
And again,
I am renting.

89
00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:57.280
That's okay.

90
00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:02.230
You think they're using sandy hook as an excuse to get you off the air and to

91
00:05:02.231 --> 00:05:06.250
censor you and to take away your ability to make income.
Not because of that,

92
00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:09.040
but using that as an excuse because of the other things that you do.

93
00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:13.800
Oh they like targeting things like Google and talking about things that you

94
00:05:13.801 --> 00:05:16.260
talking about where were there in China and China's allow,

95
00:05:16.261 --> 00:05:19.000
they're allowing China to censor the population.
I'm just telling,

96
00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:21.940
I'm not against Google or apple.
They're that.
They've did a lot of cool things.

97
00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:23.470
I'm saying stop it.

98
00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:27.190
Congress told you 10 years ago you were built here in the u s with Darpa money.

99
00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:30.220
Don't go help China do this stuff.
Don't be evil.

100
00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:33.310
Well I let me tell you something cause I knew someone who worked at Google.

101
00:05:33.311 --> 00:05:35.470
I know someone who used to work at Google,
I should say.

102
00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:39.160
Their thought process was that Google is going,

103
00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:42.370
if they don't bring Google to China in a sense it form,

104
00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:43.750
they're going to copy Google.

105
00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:47.110
This was there were the real worry because China copies everything.

106
00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:51.850
I mean their intellectual copyright ball steal it better now.

107
00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:56.110
True.
But this is what they're saying.
Wait,
what about that Joe?
But let me,

108
00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:59.690
let me explain something from the point of view of Google as a business.

109
00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:00.830
And I don't necessarily,

110
00:06:00.831 --> 00:06:03.470
I'm not saying I agree with this cause I don't reach more apple juice.

111
00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:07.730
Get some apple juice and your system fella.
Um,
they were thinking,

112
00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:11.060
and this is what I was talking to a woman who was a very high level executive

113
00:06:11.061 --> 00:06:14.990
and she was saying that they're going to steal it if we don't work with them.

114
00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:18.920
They're just going to steal Google and take the code and make their own version

115
00:06:18.921 --> 00:06:22.490
of it.
So them as a business,
they're like,
this is inevitable.

116
00:06:22.491 --> 00:06:23.240
They're going to do it anyway.

117
00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:27.650
We're just going to give in to their censorship demands.
I don't agree with it.

118
00:06:27.651 --> 00:06:30.050
I don't think it's a good idea,
but I don't know what I would do if I was Google.

119
00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:33.350
I'll tell them,
you'll tell what,
I'll tell you a little tissue.

120
00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:37.070
What should they do for China?
You're dead on with what that person told you.

121
00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:41.120
When I had the globalist 15 years ago,
20 years ago,

122
00:06:41.121 --> 00:06:44.960
tried to buy me off 10 million a year,
you know,
whatever.
Um,
by the way,
cheers.

123
00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:48.110
Cheers brother.
Anyway,
when they did all that

124
00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:53.900
well,
they did all that.
What were they trying to do?
Who's trying to buy you out?

125
00:06:53.901 --> 00:06:54.920
Well,
I can't get into it.

126
00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:57.350
You can have private meetings and the judge journalistic stuff off record,

127
00:06:57.351 --> 00:06:59.960
but I mean everybody gets business offers like Alex,

128
00:06:59.961 --> 00:07:02.300
you're going to influence things by being on the inside.

129
00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:07.130
If you don't join this and helps save the planet and do all these big things.

130
00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:09.590
My Dad,
I've got the same speech when he was in high school already.

131
00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:12.710
Ut had planned to let me tell you about that.
We'll get to that later,

132
00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:15.380
but if you don't join us,

133
00:07:15.381 --> 00:07:17.270
then the bad guys that are in the system are going to win.

134
00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:20.720
That's how they call object because that's how those people you're talking to

135
00:07:20.721 --> 00:07:22.340
are probably pretty good person.
That person at Google,

136
00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:26.690
they've had hundreds of their top engineers quit over this because here's the

137
00:07:26.691 --> 00:07:27.524
thing.

138
00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:33.310
China in 1949 was nationalist and and capitalist and our own CIA been

139
00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:38.930
declassified,
leftist,
the Ford Foundation.

140
00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:42.860
That's what's above the CIA helped put the Chai comms and power.

141
00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:45.740
It took him decades to get running water and toilets.

142
00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:49.550
They have no environmental standards,
no rules.
They've had all of our investment.

143
00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:52.400
They've been built up because the Chinese commies,

144
00:07:52.401 --> 00:07:56.120
we'll do whatever the globalist wine,
when you go and you are in China,

145
00:07:56.180 --> 00:08:00.530
they make you become state run to get 0% tax corporate.

146
00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:03.080
Okay?
That's what Trump's trying to lower ours.
Just to be competitive.

147
00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:05.900
China has 0% corporate tax.
Look it up.
Now,

148
00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:10.640
if you become state sponsored state run show,
they're claiming,
oh,

149
00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:14.240
show that China doesn't rape us of our technology.

150
00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:17.600
We're going to go over there and spread our legs to them even more.

151
00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:20.990
So it's not a rape.
We're willing and we're going to take you along with us.

152
00:08:20.991 --> 00:08:24.770
So the idea that,
well if we don't give it to them,

153
00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:26.930
they're just gonna rip it off.
So let us go,

154
00:08:26.931 --> 00:08:29.200
really give them all the big secrets and,

155
00:08:29.201 --> 00:08:32.720
and have Google last year tell the Pentagon we're not going to help you with Ai,

156
00:08:32.721 --> 00:08:36.800
autonomous drones.
But Google gave them all the latest Ai.

157
00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:38.610
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

158
00:08:38.610 --> 00:08:40.320
<v 0>And I'm getting more sophisticated stuff in a moment.</v>

159
00:08:41.310 --> 00:08:45.330
Gave them all the sophisticated AI and now China announces they've got all these

160
00:08:45.331 --> 00:08:48.750
AI drones that are autonomous and all these AI weapons systems should erector.
