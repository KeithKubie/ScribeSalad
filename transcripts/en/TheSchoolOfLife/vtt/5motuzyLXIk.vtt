00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.640
Being dropped.
It will happen to us all, at some point.

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:16.800
So negotiating the pain with a measure of reason belongs to the art of living.

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.740
A number of tips suggest themselves.

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.440
Firstly... don't attempt to minimize what's happened.

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:25.440
Being 'brave' has no place here.

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:33.700
Allow your sadness so much room, so much time, so many melancholic songs, hot baths and indulgent meals

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:38.900
you eventually bore yourself back into an appetite for life.

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:41.600
Secondly... believe them when they said it.

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:49.180
Don’t imagine that their past sweetness and kind words provides any covert indications of future commitment.

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:55.300
Kill any remaining hope yourself, if they didn’t quite have the courage to do so themselves.

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:59.480
Don’t imagine that anyone can love on command.

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.580
The capacity to feel attracted lies outside the will.

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:07.400
It isn’t a question of them not trying hard enough.

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:14.640
Remove morality from it: they were not being ‘bad’ for not loving, and nor were you ‘good’ for wanting them.

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.660
You were both on search for pleasure that took you down different and conflicting routes.

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:27.740
Our conscious minds ride like tiny boats on the swells of unconscious psychoanalytic and biological seas.

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.240
So don’t turn this into a morality tale.

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:36.600
They acted weirdly around the break up not because they were bad or – indeed – unsure.

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.160
They just felt terribly guilty... because they're nice.

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.380
Which doesn’t, though, mean that they want you.

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.960
Many of us are predisposed to think especially well of people who don’t want us.

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.240
It feeds into our reserves of self-hatred.

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.640
But this isn’t romanticism, it’s an illness.

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:04.720
The true challenge is to stop being so revolted by people who do in fact want us and so admiring of those who don’t.

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:10.820
Think back to when you rejected people: you didn’t hate them or regret them.

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:14.740
The chief emotions were embarrassment and pity.

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:20.800
Don’t connect up the rejection with everything you fear and hate about being you.

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.940
Don’t accuse them of cowardice.

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.120
Don’t exaggerate their qualities.

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.260
Don't insist on their uniqueness.

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.400
Don't offer them sex in the hope of changing their mind.

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:35.760
Don't imagine that people can fall back in love with someone out of pity or of guilt.

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.100
And don't defensively maintain that they had a ‘fear of intimacy’.

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:45.200
Just try to laugh. And have a few rounds of casual sex, if that helps.

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:51.040
But above all, don’t keep thinking of the end of this relationship as tragically sad.

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:59.820
The only good relationship, the only relationship worth mourning, would be one to which two people desperately wanted to belong.

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:07.680
And this wasn’t – in the end – despite all the promising signs – that kind of relationship... at all.
