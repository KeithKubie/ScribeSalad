00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.460
So this works for things other than words. The place where

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:06.110
you've seen it the most so far has been in language,

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:07.689
but we're also going to to see how to use it to

00:00:07.689 --> 00:00:10.550
make procedures. And you'll also see how to use it in

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:13.800
later classes, how to define data structures. There are lots and

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.780
lots of different things in computing that are defined recursively. And

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:20.660
a recursive definition has two parts. It has the base case.

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:24.660
In our example with the word, that was the second rule.

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:27.360
And the base case we can think of as

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:31.330
a starting point. And the important thing about the base

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:35.820
case, is it's not defined in terms of itself. It

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.400
has to be something where we already know how to

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:42.260
define it. So for programs, it's usually going to be the

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.540
smallest input, or one of the simplest inputs. Something where

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:47.280
we already know the answer. We don't have to do

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.900
any computation to figure it out. The second part is

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:54.240
the recursive case. And that is defined in terms of itself.

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:57.570
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.310
But it shouldn't be defined in terms of

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:01.660
itself exactly. It should be defined in terms of

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:03.880
some sort of smaller version of itself. We need

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:06.040
to make progress to eventually get to the base

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.360
case. We'll see what that means in programs

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.280
soon. First, we're going to try one other example not

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.370
in terms of a program, just to get a

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:17.050
better sense for how things can be defined recursively.
