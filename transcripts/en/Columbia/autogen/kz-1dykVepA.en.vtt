the afternoon we have your exams for you

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570
the afternoon we have your exams for you
 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.530
the afternoon we have your exams for you
you can get them after was that a sigh

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540
you can get them after was that a sigh
 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:26.679
you can get them after was that a sigh
of something was the average 76 and

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:26.689
of something was the average 76 and
 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:29.029
of something was the average 76 and
based on the results we've decided to

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039
based on the results we've decided to
 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.089
based on the results we've decided to
make the final not cumulative but just

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099
make the final not cumulative but just
 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:38.510
make the final not cumulative but just
from now on okay yeah it was my idea

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520
from now on okay yeah it was my idea
 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.110
from now on okay yeah it was my idea
Saul didn't want to do it just kidding

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120
Saul didn't want to do it just kidding
 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.959

in class this final will not be

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370
in class this final will not be
 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.000
in class this final will not be
cumulative it'll just be from the

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010
cumulative it'll just be from the
 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:59.510

lecture after the midterm okay today we

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520
lecture after the midterm okay today we
 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.010
lecture after the midterm okay today we
are going to talk about a particular

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020
are going to talk about a particular
 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.139
are going to talk about a particular
virus which is unusual for this course

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149
virus which is unusual for this course
 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.270
virus which is unusual for this course
we usually don't have lectures on

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280
we usually don't have lectures on
 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.310
we usually don't have lectures on
individual viruses in fact I designed

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320
individual viruses in fact I designed
 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.190
individual viruses in fact I designed
this course on purpose not to do that

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200
this course on purpose not to do that
 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.460
this course on purpose not to do that
rather to do it in terms of function in

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470
rather to do it in terms of function in
 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.800
rather to do it in terms of function in
steps of replication but this is a

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810
steps of replication but this is a
 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.770
steps of replication but this is a
really important virus this is the

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:17.780
really important virus this is the
 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.600
really important virus this is the
pandemic of our era so it really

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610
pandemic of our era so it really
 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.880
pandemic of our era so it really
deserves a lecture of its own and that's

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890
deserves a lecture of its own and that's
 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.870
deserves a lecture of its own and that's
of course H HIV and the AIDS pandemic

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:25.880
of course H HIV and the AIDS pandemic
 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:31.069

of this unusual cluster of opportunistic
 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.710
of this unusual cluster of opportunistic
infections and it was followed by many

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720
infections and it was followed by many
 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.850

Colombia in 1982 and sitting down with
 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:20.990
Colombia in 1982 and sitting down with
colleagues and they're saying have you

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000
colleagues and they're saying have you
 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.240
colleagues and they're saying have you
heard about this new infection no one

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250
heard about this new infection no one
 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.640
heard about this new infection no one
knows what it is well shortly afterward

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650
knows what it is well shortly afterward
 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.000
knows what it is well shortly afterward
it was sorted out and it's turned out

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010
it was sorted out and it's turned out
 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.400
it was sorted out and it's turned out
that this infection was caused by a new

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410
that this infection was caused by a new
 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.770

that wasn't the name originally given to
 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.930
that wasn't the name originally given to
it it was given two different names and

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940
it it was given two different names and
 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.540
it it was given two different names and
eventually at some point the

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550
eventually at some point the
 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.460
eventually at some point the
nomenclature committees got together and

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470
nomenclature committees got together and
 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:46.580
nomenclature committees got together and
came up with this so the virus was first

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590
came up with this so the virus was first
 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:50.090
came up with this so the virus was first
isolated in 1983 from the lymph node of

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100
isolated in 1983 from the lymph node of
 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:53.480
isolated in 1983 from the lymph node of
a patient with lymph adenopathy swollen

a patient with lymph adenopathy swollen
 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:55.760
a patient with lymph adenopathy swollen
lymph nodes and this is one of the

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:55.770
lymph nodes and this is one of the
 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:57.710
lymph nodes and this is one of the
typical presentations of this infection

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720
typical presentations of this infection
 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.350
typical presentations of this infection
this happened in Paris it was

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360
this happened in Paris it was
 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.430
this happened in Paris it was
subsequently isolated at the NIH and

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440
subsequently isolated at the NIH and
 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.860
subsequently isolated at the NIH and
UCSF a lot of controversy about who

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870
UCSF a lot of controversy about who
 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:08.870
UCSF a lot of controversy about who
discovered this initially books have

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880
discovered this initially books have
 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.720
discovered this initially books have
been written about it but it it's

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730
been written about it but it it's
 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:16.340
been written about it but it it's
clearly first isolated in Paris electron

microscopy of the virus and sequence
analysis showed that there are Lenti

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400
analysis showed that there are Lenti
 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.430
analysis showed that there are Lenti
viruses which was at this time already a

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440
viruses which was at this time already a
 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.440
viruses which was at this time already a
known group in the retrovirus family

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450
known group in the retrovirus family
 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:26.420
known group in the retrovirus family
which we'll talk about in a moment so

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430
which we'll talk about in a moment so
 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.460
which we'll talk about in a moment so
here is a cartoon of the virion

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470
here is a cartoon of the virion
 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.590
here is a cartoon of the virion
it's a typical retrovirus has an

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:30.600
it's a typical retrovirus has an
 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.900
it's a typical retrovirus has an
envelope there are glycoproteins in the

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910
envelope there are glycoproteins in the
 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:36.410
envelope there are glycoproteins in the
envelope and within it is a core with a

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420
envelope and within it is a core with a
 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.180
envelope and within it is a core with a
variety of proteins reverse

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190
variety of proteins reverse
 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:40.370
variety of proteins reverse
transcriptase integrase RNA CH protease

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380
transcriptase integrase RNA CH protease
 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:42.710
transcriptase integrase RNA CH protease
and the viral RNA of which there are two

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720
and the viral RNA of which there are two
 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.330
and the viral RNA of which there are two
copies and here's an electron micrograph

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340
copies and here's an electron micrograph
 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.430
copies and here's an electron micrograph
so this has an unusual conical shaped

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440
so this has an unusual conical shaped
 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.920
so this has an unusual conical shaped
core this is characteristic of the

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930
core this is characteristic of the
 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:51.170
core this is characteristic of the
Lente's and this distinguishes it from

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180
Lente's and this distinguishes it from
 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:54.760
Lente's and this distinguishes it from
some of the other retroviruses as well

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:54.770
some of the other retroviruses as well
 

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:57.860
some of the other retroviruses as well
so the retrovirus family we've talked

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870
so the retrovirus family we've talked
 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:59.900
so the retrovirus family we've talked
quite a bit about retroviruses in terms

00:03:59.900 --> 00:03:59.910
quite a bit about retroviruses in terms
 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:02.180
quite a bit about retroviruses in terms
of replication but not so much about

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190
of replication but not so much about
 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:07.550
of replication but not so much about
disease it is divided into a couple of

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560
disease it is divided into a couple of
 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:10.310
disease it is divided into a couple of
sections if you will there are ortho

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:10.320
sections if you will there are ortho
 

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:12.830
sections if you will there are ortho
retro véronique there's another section

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840
retro véronique there's another section
 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.540
retro véronique there's another section
which I haven't shown here and this is

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:14.550
which I haven't shown here and this is
 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:17.449
which I haven't shown here and this is
further divided into alpha retroviruses

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:17.459
further divided into alpha retroviruses
 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:20.199
further divided into alpha retroviruses
beta gamma and Delta retroviruses and

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:20.209
beta gamma and Delta retroviruses and
 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:23.469
beta gamma and Delta retroviruses and
epsilon and then finally lentiviruses

00:04:23.469 --> 00:04:23.479
epsilon and then finally lentiviruses
 

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:27.680
epsilon and then finally lentiviruses
so the known human retrovirus

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:27.690
so the known human retrovirus
 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:31.400
so the known human retrovirus
are either Delta retroviruses htlv 1 2 &amp;

3 human t-cell leukemia viruses these
 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:37.070
3 human t-cell leukemia viruses these
are actually discovered before HIV and

are actually discovered before HIV and
 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:41.960
are actually discovered before HIV and
then HIV 1 and to these htlv s by the

immunodeficiency of horses and this was

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:40.730
immunodeficiency of horses and this was
 

00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:43.120
immunodeficiency of horses and this was
isolated in the early 1900s so the idea

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:43.130
isolated in the early 1900s so the idea
 

00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:45.430
isolated in the early 1900s so the idea
of an immunodeficiency causing virus

00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:45.440
of an immunodeficiency causing virus
 

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:47.800

wasn't new it had been seen already in
 

00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:51.670
wasn't new it had been seen already in
other animals so the name of course is

00:07:51.670 --> 00:07:51.680
other animals so the name of course is
 

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:54.190

respiratory tract infections are the
 

00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:28.820
respiratory tract infections are the
biggest killers and this includes

00:12:28.820 --> 00:12:28.830
biggest killers and this includes
 

00:12:28.830 --> 00:12:31.640

just to give you a perspective of what's

00:12:59.390 --> 00:12:59.400
just to give you a perspective of what's

now as for as far as controlling age

00:13:05.210 --> 00:13:05.220
now as for as far as controlling age
 

00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:06.860
now as for as far as controlling age
goes we will talk about this a lot more

00:13:06.860 --> 00:13:06.870
goes we will talk about this a lot more
 

00:13:06.870 --> 00:13:10.370
goes we will talk about this a lot more
when we talk about antivirals and

00:13:10.370 --> 00:13:10.380
when we talk about antivirals and
 

00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:12.530
when we talk about antivirals and
vaccines but I just want to mention that

00:13:12.530 --> 00:13:12.540
vaccines but I just want to mention that
 

00:13:12.540 --> 00:13:14.390

wants to get around the problem of
 

00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:20.750
wants to get around the problem of
resistance and we'll talk about the

00:13:20.750 --> 00:13:20.760
resistance and we'll talk about the
 

00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:22.269
resistance and we'll talk about the
numbers later in

00:13:22.269 --> 00:13:22.279
numbers later in
 

00:13:22.279 --> 00:13:24.249
numbers later in
their lecture but this is only good in

00:13:24.249 --> 00:13:24.259
their lecture but this is only good in
 

00:13:24.259 --> 00:13:25.660
their lecture but this is only good in
countries with money because these are

00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:25.670
countries with money because these are
 

00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:27.369
countries with money because these are
very expensive so unfortunately poor

00:13:27.369 --> 00:13:27.379
very expensive so unfortunately poor
 

00:13:27.379 --> 00:13:29.800

countries though aren't able to use
 

00:13:29.810 --> 00:13:32.530
countries though aren't able to use
these triple drug therapies so in poor

00:13:32.530 --> 00:13:32.540
these triple drug therapies so in poor
 

00:13:32.540 --> 00:13:34.360
these triple drug therapies so in poor
countries people continue to die because

00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:34.370

they can't access antivirals Bill Gates
 

00:13:39.199 --> 00:13:42.429
they can't access antivirals Bill Gates
could probably help out here these are

00:13:42.429 --> 00:13:42.439
could probably help out here these are
 

00:13:42.439 --> 00:13:45.100
could probably help out here these are
some of the antiretroviral agents that

00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:45.110
some of the antiretroviral agents that
 

00:13:45.110 --> 00:13:48.610
some of the antiretroviral agents that
have been approved in the US the pathway

00:13:48.610 --> 00:13:48.620
have been approved in the US the pathway
 

00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:50.739
have been approved in the US the pathway
of AIDS antiviral discovery has been

00:13:50.739 --> 00:13:50.749
of AIDS antiviral discovery has been
 

00:13:50.749 --> 00:13:53.350
of AIDS antiviral discovery has been
phenomenal from the onset there's been

00:13:53.350 --> 00:13:53.360
phenomenal from the onset there's been
 

00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:55.629
phenomenal from the onset there's been
an amazing amount of research going into

00:13:55.629 --> 00:13:55.639
an amazing amount of research going into
 

00:13:55.639 --> 00:13:56.769
an amazing amount of research going into
this and you can see there over 20

00:13:56.769 --> 00:13:56.779
this and you can see there over 20
 

00:13:56.779 --> 00:13:59.439
this and you can see there over 20
different drugs of all sorts and we'll

00:13:59.439 --> 00:13:59.449
different drugs of all sorts and we'll
 

00:13:59.449 --> 00:14:01.269
different drugs of all sorts and we'll
go into these in another lecture in more

00:14:01.269 --> 00:14:01.279
go into these in another lecture in more
 

00:14:01.279 --> 00:14:03.220
go into these in another lecture in more
detail these were initially used

00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:03.230
detail these were initially used
 

00:14:03.230 --> 00:14:06.009
detail these were initially used
individually but they rapidly selected

00:14:06.009 --> 00:14:06.019
individually but they rapidly selected
 

00:14:06.019 --> 00:14:08.110
individually but they rapidly selected
for viral mutants that were resistant

00:14:08.110 --> 00:14:08.120
for viral mutants that were resistant
 

00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:10.059
for viral mutants that were resistant
and then the idea came to do them in

00:14:10.059 --> 00:14:10.069
and then the idea came to do them in
 

00:14:10.069 --> 00:14:12.790
and then the idea came to do them in
combination so now we have fixed dose

00:14:12.790 --> 00:14:12.800
combination so now we have fixed dose
 

00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:14.860
combination so now we have fixed dose
combination of three they're currently

00:14:14.860 --> 00:14:14.870
combination of three they're currently
 

00:14:14.870 --> 00:14:17.799
combination of three they're currently
six different combinations of three

00:14:17.799 --> 00:14:17.809
six different combinations of three
 

00:14:17.809 --> 00:14:19.239
six different combinations of three
different drugs that are approved for

00:14:19.239 --> 00:14:19.249
different drugs that are approved for
 

00:14:19.249 --> 00:14:21.939
different drugs that are approved for
use in the US and in particular this

00:14:21.939 --> 00:14:21.949
use in the US and in particular this
 

00:14:21.949 --> 00:14:24.489
use in the US and in particular this
this pill called a triplet it's one pill

00:14:24.489 --> 00:14:24.499
this pill called a triplet it's one pill
 

00:14:24.499 --> 00:14:26.049
this pill called a triplet it's one pill
that has all three in it it makes it

00:14:26.049 --> 00:14:26.059
that has all three in it it makes it
 

00:14:26.059 --> 00:14:27.910
that has all three in it it makes it
very easy to take these drugs as opposed

00:14:27.910 --> 00:14:27.920
very easy to take these drugs as opposed
 

00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:30.639
very easy to take these drugs as opposed
to taking three separate ones so this is

00:14:30.639 --> 00:14:30.649
to taking three separate ones so this is
 

00:14:30.649 --> 00:14:32.139
to taking three separate ones so this is
called heart or highly active

00:14:32.139 --> 00:14:32.149
called heart or highly active
 

00:14:32.149 --> 00:14:34.689
called heart or highly active
antiretroviral therapy or combination

00:14:34.689 --> 00:14:34.699
antiretroviral therapy or combination
 

00:14:34.699 --> 00:14:37.929
antiretroviral therapy or combination
therapy so this can really extend the

00:14:37.929 --> 00:14:37.939
therapy so this can really extend the
 

00:14:37.939 --> 00:14:40.840
therapy so this can really extend the
life span of individuals that have are

00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:40.850
life span of individuals that have are
 

00:14:40.850 --> 00:14:43.240
life span of individuals that have are
infected with HIV one but the problem is

00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:43.250
infected with HIV one but the problem is
 

00:14:43.250 --> 00:14:45.400
infected with HIV one but the problem is
there's no cure we can't get rid of the

00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:45.410
there's no cure we can't get rid of the
 

00:14:45.410 --> 00:14:46.990
there's no cure we can't get rid of the
virus

00:14:46.990 --> 00:14:47.000
virus
 

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.749
virus
remember these are retroviruses so you

00:14:49.749 --> 00:14:49.759
remember these are retroviruses so you
 

00:14:49.759 --> 00:14:52.150
remember these are retroviruses so you
should know that these integrate their

00:14:52.150 --> 00:14:52.160
should know that these integrate their
 

00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:54.999
should know that these integrate their
genomes into your cells so you can't

00:14:54.999 --> 00:14:55.009
genomes into your cells so you can't
 

00:14:55.009 --> 00:15:07.730
genomes into your cells so you can't
clear virus yes

00:15:07.730 --> 00:15:07.740
 
 

00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:14.270
 
yes well if you can catch them before

00:15:14.270 --> 00:15:14.280
yes well if you can catch them before
 

00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:16.950
yes well if you can catch them before
integration occurs to a large extent

00:15:16.950 --> 00:15:16.960
integration occurs to a large extent
 

00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:19.410
integration occurs to a large extent
then you can prevent them from being

00:15:19.410 --> 00:15:19.420
then you can prevent them from being
 

00:15:19.420 --> 00:15:21.360
then you can prevent them from being
infected so in the early days in the

00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:21.370
infected so in the early days in the
 

00:15:21.370 --> 00:15:23.490
infected so in the early days in the
early stages when it's an acute

00:15:23.490 --> 00:15:23.500
early stages when it's an acute
 

00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:26.400
early stages when it's an acute
infection if you prevent enough Furion's

00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:26.410
infection if you prevent enough Furion's
 

00:15:26.410 --> 00:15:27.750
infection if you prevent enough Furion's
from being made with the anti

00:15:27.750 --> 00:15:27.760
from being made with the anti
 

00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:29.400
from being made with the anti
retrovirals you can catch it before it

00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:29.410
retrovirals you can catch it before it
 

00:15:29.410 --> 00:15:38.700
retrovirals you can catch it before it
goes into this stage yes yeah and we

00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:38.710
goes into this stage yes yeah and we
 

00:15:38.710 --> 00:15:43.020
goes into this stage yes yeah and we
will talk about that in a moment so yes

00:15:43.020 --> 00:15:43.030
will talk about that in a moment so yes
 

00:15:43.030 --> 00:15:46.320
will talk about that in a moment so yes
if you're suspected of being stuck you

00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:46.330
if you're suspected of being stuck you
 

00:15:46.330 --> 00:15:49.920
if you're suspected of being stuck you
get on to anti retrovirals right away so

00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:49.930
get on to anti retrovirals right away so
 

00:15:49.930 --> 00:15:51.360
get on to anti retrovirals right away so
we have anti retrovirals but we don't

00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:51.370
we have anti retrovirals but we don't
 

00:15:51.370 --> 00:15:53.430
we have anti retrovirals but we don't
have a vaccine yet it's a lot of work in

00:15:53.430 --> 00:15:53.440
have a vaccine yet it's a lot of work in
 

00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:54.900
have a vaccine yet it's a lot of work in
this area but it's a really tough

00:15:54.900 --> 00:15:54.910
this area but it's a really tough
 

00:15:54.910 --> 00:15:57.870
this area but it's a really tough
problem as you will see so you can't

00:15:57.870 --> 00:15:57.880
problem as you will see so you can't
 

00:15:57.880 --> 00:16:00.510
problem as you will see so you can't
block primary infection people still get

00:16:00.510 --> 00:16:00.520
block primary infection people still get
 

00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:02.460
block primary infection people still get
infected they get diagnosed and then

00:16:02.460 --> 00:16:02.470
infected they get diagnosed and then
 

00:16:02.470 --> 00:16:04.680
infected they get diagnosed and then
they go for antiretroviral therapy so by

00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:04.690
they go for antiretroviral therapy so by
 

00:16:04.690 --> 00:16:07.050
they go for antiretroviral therapy so by
that time it's too late you've already

00:16:07.050 --> 00:16:07.060
that time it's too late you've already
 

00:16:07.060 --> 00:16:09.360
that time it's too late you've already
got a pool of integrated pro viruses in

00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:09.370
got a pool of integrated pro viruses in
 

00:16:09.370 --> 00:16:11.430
got a pool of integrated pro viruses in
your body that you can't get rid of as a

00:16:11.430 --> 00:16:11.440
your body that you can't get rid of as a
 

00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:13.440
your body that you can't get rid of as a
consequence you cannot stop taking your

00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:13.450
consequence you cannot stop taking your
 

00:16:13.450 --> 00:16:15.390
consequence you cannot stop taking your
drugs you have to take three drugs a day

00:16:15.390 --> 00:16:15.400
drugs you have to take three drugs a day
 

00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:18.720
drugs you have to take three drugs a day
or whatever for the rest of your life if

00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:18.730
or whatever for the rest of your life if
 

00:16:18.730 --> 00:16:20.790
or whatever for the rest of your life if
you stop taking them the virus will once

00:16:20.790 --> 00:16:20.800
you stop taking them the virus will once
 

00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:24.660
you stop taking them the virus will once
again multiply within you and eventually

00:16:24.660 --> 00:16:24.670
again multiply within you and eventually
 

00:16:24.670 --> 00:16:28.530
again multiply within you and eventually
cause disease as we will see the problem

00:16:28.530 --> 00:16:28.540
cause disease as we will see the problem
 

00:16:28.540 --> 00:16:29.880
cause disease as we will see the problem
the main problem is that there are

00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:29.890
the main problem is that there are
 

00:16:29.890 --> 00:16:32.160
the main problem is that there are
reservoirs of cells long-lived cells

00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:32.170
reservoirs of cells long-lived cells
 

00:16:32.170 --> 00:16:34.440
reservoirs of cells long-lived cells
that remain within you so if the cells

00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:34.450
that remain within you so if the cells
 

00:16:34.450 --> 00:16:37.050
that remain within you so if the cells
turned over very quickly in in the face

00:16:37.050 --> 00:16:37.060
turned over very quickly in in the face
 

00:16:37.060 --> 00:16:38.880
turned over very quickly in in the face
of antiviral therapy you could get rid

00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:38.890
of antiviral therapy you could get rid
 

00:16:38.890 --> 00:16:40.170
of antiviral therapy you could get rid
of all the cells but there are some very

00:16:40.170 --> 00:16:40.180
of all the cells but there are some very
 

00:16:40.180 --> 00:16:42.840
of all the cells but there are some very
long-lived reservoirs that exist so

00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:42.850
long-lived reservoirs that exist so
 

00:16:42.850 --> 00:16:43.940
long-lived reservoirs that exist so
there have been people on

00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:43.950
there have been people on
 

00:16:43.950 --> 00:16:46.140
there have been people on
antiretrovirals for over ten years and

00:16:46.140 --> 00:16:46.150
antiretrovirals for over ten years and
 

00:16:46.150 --> 00:16:49.290
antiretrovirals for over ten years and
they still have Pro viral sequences in

00:16:49.290 --> 00:16:49.300
they still have Pro viral sequences in
 

00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:50.910
they still have Pro viral sequences in
certain pools and we're not even sure

00:16:50.910 --> 00:16:50.920
certain pools and we're not even sure
 

00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:52.440
certain pools and we're not even sure
what all these pools are some of them

00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:52.450
what all these pools are some of them
 

00:16:52.450 --> 00:16:55.020
what all these pools are some of them
are memory long-lived memory t-cells but

00:16:55.020 --> 00:16:55.030
are memory long-lived memory t-cells but
 

00:16:55.030 --> 00:16:56.760
are memory long-lived memory t-cells but
there may be other pools as well that we

00:16:56.760 --> 00:16:56.770
there may be other pools as well that we
 

00:16:56.770 --> 00:16:59.130
there may be other pools as well that we
don't understand and we know this

00:16:59.130 --> 00:16:59.140
don't understand and we know this
 

00:16:59.140 --> 00:17:01.110
don't understand and we know this
because many people stop taking their

00:17:01.110 --> 00:17:01.120
because many people stop taking their
 

00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:02.910
because many people stop taking their
drugs they feel great after a few years

00:17:02.910 --> 00:17:02.920
drugs they feel great after a few years
 

00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:04.410
drugs they feel great after a few years
and it's expensive so they stopped

00:17:04.410 --> 00:17:04.420
and it's expensive so they stopped
 

00:17:04.420 --> 00:17:06.750
and it's expensive so they stopped
taking them and they get AIDS again so

00:17:06.750 --> 00:17:06.760
taking them and they get AIDS again so
 

00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:08.250
taking them and they get AIDS again so
these experiments happen all the time

00:17:08.250 --> 00:17:08.260
these experiments happen all the time
 

00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:10.830
these experiments happen all the time
they also get drug-resistant viruses

00:17:10.830 --> 00:17:10.840
they also get drug-resistant viruses
 

00:17:10.840 --> 00:17:12.540
they also get drug-resistant viruses
even on triple therapy and you just

00:17:12.540 --> 00:17:12.550
even on triple therapy and you just
 

00:17:12.550 --> 00:17:15.540
even on triple therapy and you just
change the combination drugs are

00:17:15.540 --> 00:17:15.550
change the combination drugs are
 

00:17:15.550 --> 00:17:16.780
change the combination drugs are
expensive which is a No

00:17:16.780 --> 00:17:16.790
expensive which is a No
 

00:17:16.790 --> 00:17:19.810

the reason why it's problematic and all

00:17:19.810 --> 00:17:19.820
the reason why it's problematic and all
 

00:17:19.820 --> 00:17:22.330
the reason why it's problematic and all
this amounts to is that age is becoming

00:17:22.330 --> 00:17:22.340
this amounts to is that age is becoming
 

00:17:22.340 --> 00:17:23.650
this amounts to is that age is becoming

take care of it even with antivirals

00:17:28.120 --> 00:17:28.130
take care of it even with antivirals
 

00:17:28.130 --> 00:17:29.830
take care of it even with antivirals
that can't afford them so the virus

00:17:29.830 --> 00:17:29.840
that can't afford them so the virus
 

00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:36.720
that can't afford them so the virus

where HIV came from our current thinking
 

00:18:53.660 --> 00:18:58.150
where HIV came from our current thinking
is that both HIV and one-and-two came

00:18:58.150 --> 00:18:58.160
is that both HIV and one-and-two came
 

00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:01.060
is that both HIV and one-and-two came
from separate colonization events of

00:19:01.060 --> 00:19:01.070
from separate colonization events of
 

00:19:01.070 --> 00:19:03.310
from separate colonization events of
simian viruses and humans that is two

00:19:03.310 --> 00:19:03.320
simian viruses and humans that is two

what kind of animals that might be

00:19:13.270 --> 00:19:13.280
what kind of animals that might be
 

00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:15.790
what kind of animals that might be
you'll see there are involving monkeys

00:19:15.790 --> 00:19:15.800
you'll see there are involving monkeys
 

00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:18.790
you'll see there are involving monkeys
and in Africa where is which is where

00:19:18.790 --> 00:19:18.800

HIV 1 &amp; 2 emerged it involved trapping

00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:23.810
HIV 1 &amp; 2 emerged it involved trapping
 

00:19:23.810 --> 00:19:25.960
HIV 1 &amp; 2 emerged it involved trapping
monkeys and slaughtering them and

00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:25.970
monkeys and slaughtering them and
 

00:19:25.970 --> 00:19:28.510
monkeys and slaughtering them and
selling them at market and so the virus

00:19:28.510 --> 00:19:28.520
selling them at market and so the virus
 

00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:29.820
selling them at market and so the virus
jumped from those

00:19:29.820 --> 00:19:29.830
jumped from those
 

00:19:29.830 --> 00:19:32.430
jumped from those
animals which had virus in them and into

00:19:32.430 --> 00:19:32.440
animals which had virus in them and into
 

00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:36.630
animals which had virus in them and into
people at some point to do this first we

00:19:36.630 --> 00:19:36.640
people at some point to do this first we
 

00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:39.060
people at some point to do this first we
have to talk about different subtypes of

00:19:39.060 --> 00:19:39.070
have to talk about different subtypes of
 

00:19:39.070 --> 00:19:41.759
have to talk about different subtypes of
the virus the virus is HIV one anyway is

00:19:41.759 --> 00:19:41.769
the virus the virus is HIV one anyway is
 

00:19:41.769 --> 00:19:43.830
the virus the virus is HIV one anyway is
divided into what are called clades or

00:19:43.830 --> 00:19:43.840
divided into what are called clades or
 

00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:46.680
divided into what are called clades or
subtypes these are basically antigenic

00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:46.690
subtypes these are basically antigenic
 

00:19:46.690 --> 00:19:48.600
subtypes these are basically antigenic
groupings of the viruses there currently

00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:48.610
groupings of the viruses there currently
 

00:19:48.610 --> 00:19:50.909
groupings of the viruses there currently
ten different clades a through J and

00:19:50.909 --> 00:19:50.919
ten different clades a through J and
 

00:19:50.919 --> 00:19:53.549
ten different clades a through J and
they are based on the sequence of the

00:19:53.549 --> 00:19:53.559
they are based on the sequence of the
 

00:19:53.559 --> 00:19:56.009
they are based on the sequence of the
envelope and the gag genes so this is

00:19:56.009 --> 00:19:56.019
envelope and the gag genes so this is
 

00:19:56.019 --> 00:19:58.740
envelope and the gag genes so this is
basically a sequence alignment and there

00:19:58.740 --> 00:19:58.750
basically a sequence alignment and there
 

00:19:58.750 --> 00:20:00.029
basically a sequence alignment and there
are very distinct geographical

00:20:00.029 --> 00:20:00.039
are very distinct geographical
 

00:20:00.039 --> 00:20:01.919
are very distinct geographical
restrictions of these clades which is

00:20:01.919 --> 00:20:01.929
restrictions of these clades which is
 

00:20:01.929 --> 00:20:04.529
restrictions of these clades which is
why they're important to know about so

00:20:04.529 --> 00:20:04.539
why they're important to know about so
 

00:20:04.539 --> 00:20:06.330
why they're important to know about so
here's a map of the world which shows

here's a map of the world which shows
 

00:20:06.340 --> 00:20:09.210
here's a map of the world which shows
you where the clades are they're

Africa clades a C D and E predominate

00:20:22.070 --> 00:20:22.080
Africa clades a C D and E predominate
 

00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:24.450
Africa clades a C D and E predominate
most different clades are found in

00:20:24.450 --> 00:20:24.460
most different clades are found in
 

00:20:24.460 --> 00:20:26.220
most different clades are found in
Central Africa that is the most diverse

00:20:26.220 --> 00:20:26.230
Central Africa that is the most diverse
 

00:20:26.230 --> 00:20:28.919
Central Africa that is the most diverse
numbers of clades elsewhere one or two

00:20:28.919 --> 00:20:28.929
numbers of clades elsewhere one or two
 

00:20:28.929 --> 00:20:30.840
numbers of clades elsewhere one or two
predominate so for example here in the

00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:30.850
predominate so for example here in the
 

00:20:30.850 --> 00:20:33.720
predominate so for example here in the
US and in Western Europe predominantly

00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:33.730
US and in Western Europe predominantly
 

00:20:33.730 --> 00:20:36.720

clade B but it does change with time and

00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:36.730
clade B but it does change with time and
 

00:20:36.730 --> 00:20:38.490
clade B but it does change with time and
over time in Africa we've seen the

00:20:38.490 --> 00:20:38.500
over time in Africa we've seen the
 

00:20:38.500 --> 00:20:40.289
over time in Africa we've seen the
spread of C clade which was initially

00:20:40.289 --> 00:20:40.299
spread of C clade which was initially
 

00:20:40.299 --> 00:20:43.139
spread of C clade which was initially
minimal there and it has taken foothold

00:20:43.139 --> 00:20:43.149
minimal there and it has taken foothold
 

00:20:43.149 --> 00:20:45.779
minimal there and it has taken foothold
and spread so the the ability of people

00:20:45.779 --> 00:20:45.789
and spread so the the ability of people
 

00:20:45.789 --> 00:20:48.720
and spread so the the ability of people
to travel extensively makes it easy for

00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:48.730
to travel extensively makes it easy for
 

00:20:48.730 --> 00:20:50.850
to travel extensively makes it easy for
these clades to move around and that's

00:20:50.850 --> 00:20:50.860
these clades to move around and that's
 

00:20:50.860 --> 00:20:52.620
these clades to move around and that's
an important consideration when you

00:20:52.620 --> 00:20:52.630
an important consideration when you
 

00:20:52.630 --> 00:20:55.889
an important consideration when you
devise a vaccine because the vaccines

00:20:55.889 --> 00:20:55.899
devise a vaccine because the vaccines
 

00:20:55.899 --> 00:20:58.620
devise a vaccine because the vaccines
are likely to be clade specific and so

00:20:58.620 --> 00:20:58.630
are likely to be clade specific and so
 

00:20:58.630 --> 00:21:00.570
are likely to be clade specific and so
you may make a clade B vaccine for the

00:21:00.570 --> 00:21:00.580
you may make a clade B vaccine for the
 

00:21:00.580 --> 00:21:02.909
you may make a clade B vaccine for the
for the US but as people with other

00:21:02.909 --> 00:21:02.919
for the US but as people with other
 

00:21:02.919 --> 00:21:04.710
for the US but as people with other
clades move into the u.s. they're gonna

00:21:04.710 --> 00:21:04.720
clades move into the u.s. they're gonna
 

00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:06.720
clades move into the u.s. they're gonna
overcome that protection and so you have

00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:06.730
overcome that protection and so you have
 

00:21:06.730 --> 00:21:14.789
overcome that protection and so you have
to be be able to be flexible yes they

00:21:14.789 --> 00:21:14.799
to be be able to be flexible yes they
 

00:21:14.799 --> 00:21:16.860
to be be able to be flexible yes they
can in some cases they can correlate

00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:16.870
can in some cases they can correlate
 

00:21:16.870 --> 00:21:19.560
can in some cases they can correlate
with virulence and transmissibility but

00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:19.570
with virulence and transmissibility but
 

00:21:19.570 --> 00:21:23.490
with virulence and transmissibility but
we don't exactly understand that so here

00:21:23.490 --> 00:21:23.500
we don't exactly understand that so here
 

00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:25.860
we don't exactly understand that so here
are some sequence comparisons among

00:21:25.860 --> 00:21:25.870
are some sequence comparisons among
 

00:21:25.870 --> 00:21:28.169
are some sequence comparisons among
these lentiviruses to give you an idea

00:21:28.169 --> 00:21:28.179
these lentiviruses to give you an idea
 

00:21:28.179 --> 00:21:31.259
these lentiviruses to give you an idea
about the origins so here is a this is a

00:21:31.259 --> 00:21:31.269
about the origins so here is a this is a
 

00:21:31.269 --> 00:21:33.600
about the origins so here is a this is a
phylogenetic tree where you take the

00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:33.610
phylogenetic tree where you take the
 

00:21:33.610 --> 00:21:36.889
phylogenetic tree where you take the
sequence and you calculate the amount of

00:21:36.889 --> 00:21:36.899
sequence and you calculate the amount of
 

00:21:36.899 --> 00:21:39.000
sequence and you calculate the amount of
homology among the sequences and then

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:39.010
homology among the sequences and then
 

00:21:39.010 --> 00:21:40.500
homology among the sequences and then
you make a tree based on what you think

00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:40.510
you make a tree based on what you think
 

00:21:40.510 --> 00:21:43.200
you make a tree based on what you think
might be the way these evolved from

00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:43.210
might be the way these evolved from
 

00:21:43.210 --> 00:21:46.010
might be the way these evolved from
common ancestor and this amount of

00:21:46.010 --> 00:21:46.020
common ancestor and this amount of
 

00:21:46.020 --> 00:21:49.049
common ancestor and this amount of
distance is 1% sequence difference on

00:21:49.049 --> 00:21:49.059
distance is 1% sequence difference on
 

00:21:49.059 --> 00:21:52.799
distance is 1% sequence difference on
this kind of a tree and you can see here

00:21:52.799 --> 00:21:52.809
this kind of a tree and you can see here
 

00:21:52.809 --> 00:21:55.529
this kind of a tree and you can see here

immunodeficiency viruses are down here
 

00:22:02.919 --> 00:22:05.940
immunodeficiency viruses are down here
so here we have HIV one which is right

00:22:05.940 --> 00:22:05.950
so here we have HIV one which is right
 

00:22:05.950 --> 00:22:08.519
so here we have HIV one which is right
next to a SIV which was from a

next to a SIV which was from a
 

00:22:08.529 --> 00:22:11.190
next to a SIV which was from a
chimpanzee so this is SIV chimpanzee and

00:22:11.190 --> 00:22:11.200
chimpanzee so this is SIV chimpanzee and
 

00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:15.110
chimpanzee so this is SIV chimpanzee and
then we have HIV 2 which is from a sooty

00:22:15.110 --> 00:22:15.120
then we have HIV 2 which is from a sooty
 

00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:19.700
then we have HIV 2 which is from a sooty
sooty mangabey virus so we believe that

00:22:19.700 --> 00:22:19.710
sooty mangabey virus so we believe that
 

00:22:19.710 --> 00:22:25.070

it's likely that HIV 1e evolved from
 

00:22:32.649 --> 00:22:35.899
it's likely that HIV 1e evolved from
these viruses so again the

often kept as pets

00:22:51.930 --> 00:22:51.940
often kept as pets
 

00:22:51.940 --> 00:22:53.909
often kept as pets
so there's close contact between people

00:22:53.909 --> 00:22:53.919
so there's close contact between people
 

00:22:53.919 --> 00:22:55.740
so there's close contact between people
and these animals they can scratch you

00:22:55.740 --> 00:22:55.750
and these animals they can scratch you
 

00:22:55.750 --> 00:22:57.870
and these animals they can scratch you
and transmit the virus to you all right

00:22:57.870 --> 00:22:57.880
and transmit the virus to you all right
 

00:22:57.880 --> 00:22:59.909
and transmit the virus to you all right
so two separate colonization events from

00:22:59.909 --> 00:22:59.919
so two separate colonization events from
 

00:22:59.919 --> 00:23:03.480
so two separate colonization events from

when did this happen

00:23:05.450 --> 00:23:05.460
when did this happen
 

00:23:05.460 --> 00:23:10.500
when did this happen
the oldest known sequence of HIV that we

00:23:10.500 --> 00:23:10.510
the oldest known sequence of HIV that we
 

00:23:10.510 --> 00:23:14.580
the oldest known sequence of HIV that we
have was from 1959 it's a serum sample

00:23:14.580 --> 00:23:14.590
have was from 1959 it's a serum sample
 

00:23:14.590 --> 00:23:16.799
have was from 1959 it's a serum sample
that had been stored from a Kinshasa

00:23:16.799 --> 00:23:16.809
that had been stored from a Kinshasa
 

00:23:16.809 --> 00:23:19.860
that had been stored from a Kinshasa
male and so this was taken for other

00:23:19.860 --> 00:23:19.870
male and so this was taken for other
 

00:23:19.870 --> 00:23:22.680
male and so this was taken for other
purposes in 1959 and it was stored which

00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:22.690
purposes in 1959 and it was stored which
 

00:23:22.690 --> 00:23:26.100
purposes in 1959 and it was stored which
was good and then in 1998 they went back

00:23:26.100 --> 00:23:26.110
was good and then in 1998 they went back
 

00:23:26.110 --> 00:23:27.480
was good and then in 1998 they went back
to these they were looking throughout

00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:27.490
to these they were looking throughout
 

00:23:27.490 --> 00:23:29.730
to these they were looking throughout
any any kind of clinical specimens that

00:23:29.730 --> 00:23:29.740
any any kind of clinical specimens that
 

00:23:29.740 --> 00:23:32.340
any any kind of clinical specimens that
they had and looking for HIV by a

00:23:32.340 --> 00:23:32.350
they had and looking for HIV by a
 

00:23:32.350 --> 00:23:35.700
they had and looking for HIV by a
variety of tests PCR for example and it

00:23:35.700 --> 00:23:35.710
variety of tests PCR for example and it
 

00:23:35.710 --> 00:23:37.529
variety of tests PCR for example and it
was possible to amplify the entire

00:23:37.529 --> 00:23:37.539
was possible to amplify the entire
 

00:23:37.539 --> 00:23:40.049
was possible to amplify the entire
genome from this sequence from this

00:23:40.049 --> 00:23:40.059
genome from this sequence from this
 

00:23:40.059 --> 00:23:41.850
genome from this sequence from this
serum sample and sequence it which is

00:23:41.850 --> 00:23:41.860
serum sample and sequence it which is
 

00:23:41.860 --> 00:23:45.240
serum sample and sequence it which is
really amazing and so that gave us a way

00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:45.250
really amazing and so that gave us a way
 

00:23:45.250 --> 00:23:48.240
really amazing and so that gave us a way
to clock the evolution of HIV from 1959

00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:48.250
to clock the evolution of HIV from 1959
 

00:23:48.250 --> 00:23:50.190
to clock the evolution of HIV from 1959
to the present so that was really

00:23:50.190 --> 00:23:50.200
to the present so that was really
 

00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:53.519
to the present so that was really
important to have that sequence so

00:23:53.519 --> 00:23:53.529
important to have that sequence so
 

00:23:53.529 --> 00:23:57.120
important to have that sequence so
that's called Zaire 59 and as far as we

00:23:57.120 --> 00:23:57.130
that's called Zaire 59 and as far as we
 

00:23:57.130 --> 00:23:57.360
that's called Zaire 59 and as far as we
can

00:23:57.360 --> 00:23:57.370
can
 

00:23:57.370 --> 00:23:59.220
can
how the sequence puts it at the

00:23:59.220 --> 00:23:59.230
how the sequence puts it at the
 

00:23:59.230 --> 00:24:01.530
how the sequence puts it at the
ancestral node of this D group right

00:24:01.530 --> 00:24:01.540
ancestral node of this D group right
 

00:24:01.540 --> 00:24:05.010
ancestral node of this D group right
here so these are all different HIV and

00:24:05.010 --> 00:24:05.020
here so these are all different HIV and
 

00:24:05.020 --> 00:24:08.280
here so these are all different HIV and
SIV isolates arranged according to group

00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:08.290
SIV isolates arranged according to group
 

00:24:08.290 --> 00:24:10.950
SIV isolates arranged according to group
so another way of isolating these

00:24:10.950 --> 00:24:10.960
so another way of isolating these
 

00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:13.650
so another way of isolating these
viruses is by groups which are

00:24:13.650 --> 00:24:13.660
viruses is by groups which are
 

00:24:13.660 --> 00:24:16.230
viruses is by groups which are
collections of like sequences so the D

00:24:16.230 --> 00:24:16.240
collections of like sequences so the D
 

00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:19.500
collections of like sequences so the D
group shown right here the ancestor was

about two years ago another sequence was

00:24:27.810 --> 00:24:27.820
about two years ago another sequence was
 

00:24:27.820 --> 00:24:31.049
about two years ago another sequence was
obtained from 1960 and that's from the

00:24:31.049 --> 00:24:31.059
obtained from 1960 and that's from the
 

00:24:31.059 --> 00:24:32.850
obtained from 1960 and that's from the

Democratic Republic of the Congo this
 

00:24:32.860 --> 00:24:35.720
Democratic Republic of the Congo this
was actually from a paraffin-embedded

archive and they got this and they were
 

00:24:41.710 --> 00:24:43.950
archive and they got this and they were
able to pull out almost the entire HIV

00:24:43.950 --> 00:24:43.960
able to pull out almost the entire HIV
 

00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:46.680
able to pull out almost the entire HIV

about this the 1918 flu was
 

00:24:52.090 --> 00:24:55.320
about this the 1918 flu was
reconstructed in the same way and that

here so in other words ancestral means

00:25:00.450 --> 00:25:00.460
here so in other words ancestral means

what's interesting is if you compare the

00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:07.450
what's interesting is if you compare the
 

00:25:07.450 --> 00:25:10.110
what's interesting is if you compare the
59 to 60 sequences you see a huge amount

00:25:10.110 --> 00:25:10.120
59 to 60 sequences you see a huge amount
 

00:25:10.120 --> 00:25:12.030
59 to 60 sequences you see a huge amount
of diversity already so this is already

00:25:12.030 --> 00:25:12.040
of diversity already so this is already
 

00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:14.460

multiplying extensively in people you
 

00:25:14.470 --> 00:25:17.040
multiplying extensively in people you
can use that sequence to calculate a

00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:17.050
can use that sequence to calculate a
 

00:25:17.050 --> 00:25:19.140
can use that sequence to calculate a
clock by which how much the virus

00:25:19.140 --> 00:25:19.150
clock by which how much the virus
 

00:25:19.150 --> 00:25:20.940
clock by which how much the virus
mutates each year and then you can back

00:25:20.940 --> 00:25:20.950
mutates each year and then you can back
 

00:25:20.950 --> 00:25:23.310
mutates each year and then you can back
calculate to where this probably went

00:25:23.310 --> 00:25:23.320

and that from that kind of analysis we

00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:28.210
and that from that kind of analysis we
 

00:25:28.210 --> 00:25:30.150
and that from that kind of analysis we
suspect that the M group up here

00:25:30.150 --> 00:25:30.160
suspect that the M group up here
 

00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:33.480
suspect that the M group up here
originated in around 1930 and probably

00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:33.490
originated in around 1930 and probably
 

00:25:33.490 --> 00:25:35.430
originated in around 1930 and probably

were fed to people and that's what
 

00:26:29.259 --> 00:26:31.109
were fed to people and that's what
started the outbreak so that's totally

the 40s and 50s so it took a long time
 

00:27:32.229 --> 00:27:34.499
the 40s and 50s so it took a long time
for the virus to spread from the initial

old-world monkeys are resistant to HIV

00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:13.690
old-world monkeys are resistant to HIV
 

00:28:13.690 --> 00:28:17.489
old-world monkeys are resistant to HIV
infection so the animals from which the

00:28:17.489 --> 00:28:17.499
infection so the animals from which the
 

00:28:17.499 --> 00:28:20.399
infection so the animals from which the
virus came are resistant to it it has

00:28:20.399 --> 00:28:20.409
virus came are resistant to it it has
 

00:28:20.409 --> 00:28:23.640
virus came are resistant to it it has
now evolved in people such that

00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:23.650
now evolved in people such that
 

00:28:23.650 --> 00:28:24.930
now evolved in people such that
there's no longer it being able to

00:28:24.930 --> 00:28:24.940
there's no longer it being able to
 

00:28:24.940 --> 00:28:27.510
there's no longer it being able to
infect these animals now this there is a

00:28:27.510 --> 00:28:27.520
infect these animals now this there is a
 

00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:29.520
infect these animals now this there is a
protein in these monkeys called trim5

00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:29.530
protein in these monkeys called trim5
 

00:28:29.530 --> 00:28:33.120
protein in these monkeys called trim5
alpha and that's why the the cells of

00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:33.130
alpha and that's why the the cells of
 

00:28:33.130 --> 00:28:34.590
alpha and that's why the the cells of
these animals are resistant to infection

00:28:34.590 --> 00:28:34.600
these animals are resistant to infection
 

00:28:34.600 --> 00:28:36.930
these animals are resistant to infection
this is called a restriction factor and

00:28:36.930 --> 00:28:36.940
this is called a restriction factor and
 

00:28:36.940 --> 00:28:39.480
this is called a restriction factor and
it's believed to protect to have

00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:39.490
it's believed to protect to have
 

00:28:39.490 --> 00:28:41.820
it's believed to protect to have
protected these animals from HIV

00:28:41.820 --> 00:28:41.830
protected these animals from HIV
 

00:28:41.830 --> 00:28:45.150
protected these animals from HIV
infection over the years our trim5

00:28:45.150 --> 00:28:45.160
infection over the years our trim5
 

00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:48.240
infection over the years our trim5
doesn't block HIV obviously otherwise we

00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:48.250
doesn't block HIV obviously otherwise we
 

00:28:48.250 --> 00:28:49.760
doesn't block HIV obviously otherwise we
wouldn't be talking about this right now

00:28:49.760 --> 00:28:49.770
wouldn't be talking about this right now
 

00:28:49.770 --> 00:28:54.120
wouldn't be talking about this right now
for some reason our trim5 has had to

00:28:54.120 --> 00:28:54.130
for some reason our trim5 has had to
 

00:28:54.130 --> 00:28:55.950
for some reason our trim5 has had to
stay constant maybe there are some other

00:28:55.950 --> 00:28:55.960
stay constant maybe there are some other
 

00:28:55.960 --> 00:28:58.350
stay constant maybe there are some other
pressures put on it we don't really

00:28:58.350 --> 00:28:58.360
pressures put on it we don't really
 

00:28:58.360 --> 00:29:00.270
pressures put on it we don't really
understand but it doesn't have the

00:29:00.270 --> 00:29:00.280
understand but it doesn't have the
 

00:29:00.280 --> 00:29:03.060
understand but it doesn't have the
sequence that a old world monkey trim5

00:29:03.060 --> 00:29:03.070
sequence that a old world monkey trim5
 

00:29:03.070 --> 00:29:05.540
sequence that a old world monkey trim5
alpha has and therefore we are

00:29:05.540 --> 00:29:05.550
alpha has and therefore we are
 

00:29:05.550 --> 00:29:08.580
alpha has and therefore we are
susceptible to infection but studying

00:29:08.580 --> 00:29:08.590
susceptible to infection but studying
 

00:29:08.590 --> 00:29:10.920
susceptible to infection but studying
this provides us with some ideas about

00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:10.930
this provides us with some ideas about
 

00:29:10.930 --> 00:29:12.840
this provides us with some ideas about
how we could interfere with HIV

00:29:12.840 --> 00:29:12.850
how we could interfere with HIV
 

00:29:12.850 --> 00:29:14.460
how we could interfere with HIV
infection so that's why this kind of

00:29:14.460 --> 00:29:14.470
infection so that's why this kind of
 

00:29:14.470 --> 00:29:17.340
infection so that's why this kind of
research is informative also if you take

00:29:17.340 --> 00:29:17.350
research is informative also if you take
 

00:29:17.350 --> 00:29:19.800
research is informative also if you take
cells from south african south american

00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:19.810
cells from south african south american
 

00:29:19.810 --> 00:29:22.470
cells from south african south american
owl monkeys these are also resistant to

00:29:22.470 --> 00:29:22.480
owl monkeys these are also resistant to
 

00:29:22.480 --> 00:29:24.330
owl monkeys these are also resistant to
HIV infection that's because of a

00:29:24.330 --> 00:29:24.340
HIV infection that's because of a
 

00:29:24.340 --> 00:29:26.720
HIV infection that's because of a
different protein it's trim5 fused to a

00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:26.730
different protein it's trim5 fused to a
 

00:29:26.730 --> 00:29:29.460
different protein it's trim5 fused to a
second protein called cyclic fill and a

00:29:29.460 --> 00:29:29.470
second protein called cyclic fill and a
 

00:29:29.470 --> 00:29:41.130
second protein called cyclic fill and a
yeah it's thought to be part of the

00:29:41.130 --> 00:29:41.140
yeah it's thought to be part of the
 

00:29:41.140 --> 00:29:44.880
yeah it's thought to be part of the
innate immune system of animals so this

00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:44.890
innate immune system of animals so this
 

00:29:44.890 --> 00:29:46.860
innate immune system of animals so this
this is the only known function at the

00:29:46.860 --> 00:29:46.870
this is the only known function at the
 

00:29:46.870 --> 00:29:49.170
this is the only known function at the
moment whether it does something else

00:29:49.170 --> 00:29:49.180
moment whether it does something else
 

00:29:49.180 --> 00:29:55.020
moment whether it does something else
we don't really know old-world monkeys

00:29:55.020 --> 00:29:55.030
we don't really know old-world monkeys
 

00:29:55.030 --> 00:29:57.570
we don't really know old-world monkeys
have a similar fusion protein that also

00:29:57.570 --> 00:29:57.580
have a similar fusion protein that also
 

00:29:57.580 --> 00:30:00.660
have a similar fusion protein that also
helps prevent HIV infection so this is

00:30:00.660 --> 00:30:00.670
helps prevent HIV infection so this is
 

00:30:00.670 --> 00:30:03.210
helps prevent HIV infection so this is
trim5 and this is how we think it works

00:30:03.210 --> 00:30:03.220
trim5 and this is how we think it works
 

00:30:03.220 --> 00:30:05.790
trim5 and this is how we think it works
so normally in cells that don't have

00:30:05.790 --> 00:30:05.800
so normally in cells that don't have
 

00:30:05.800 --> 00:30:07.890
so normally in cells that don't have
trim5 alpha or one that doesn't block

00:30:07.890 --> 00:30:07.900
trim5 alpha or one that doesn't block
 

00:30:07.900 --> 00:30:10.260
trim5 alpha or one that doesn't block
infection the retrovirus fuses with the

00:30:10.260 --> 00:30:10.270
infection the retrovirus fuses with the
 

00:30:10.270 --> 00:30:13.230
infection the retrovirus fuses with the
cell membrane the core is deposited in

00:30:13.230 --> 00:30:13.240
cell membrane the core is deposited in
 

00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:14.730
cell membrane the core is deposited in
the cytoplasm it undergoes reverse

00:30:14.730 --> 00:30:14.740
the cytoplasm it undergoes reverse
 

00:30:14.740 --> 00:30:16.800
the cytoplasm it undergoes reverse
transcription and eventually goes in the

00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:16.810
transcription and eventually goes in the
 

00:30:16.810 --> 00:30:18.630
transcription and eventually goes in the
nucleus so that the DNA can integrate

00:30:18.630 --> 00:30:18.640
nucleus so that the DNA can integrate
 

00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:21.170
nucleus so that the DNA can integrate
into that of the cell if you have trim5

00:30:21.170 --> 00:30:21.180
into that of the cell if you have trim5
 

00:30:21.180 --> 00:30:24.660
into that of the cell if you have trim5
present one model is that there's some

00:30:24.660 --> 00:30:24.670
present one model is that there's some
 

00:30:24.670 --> 00:30:26.730
present one model is that there's some
protein and there's trim5 in the cell

00:30:26.730 --> 00:30:26.740
protein and there's trim5 in the cell
 

00:30:26.740 --> 00:30:28.980
protein and there's trim5 in the cell
that's the green protein here it binds

00:30:28.980 --> 00:30:28.990
that's the green protein here it binds
 

00:30:28.990 --> 00:30:31.800
that's the green protein here it binds
the core and prevents it from either on

00:30:31.800 --> 00:30:31.810
the core and prevents it from either on
 

00:30:31.810 --> 00:30:33.210
the core and prevents it from either on
coding it may block reverse

00:30:33.210 --> 00:30:33.220
coding it may block reverse
 

00:30:33.220 --> 00:30:35.250
coding it may block reverse
transcription it may block transport

00:30:35.250 --> 00:30:35.260
transcription it may block transport
 

00:30:35.260 --> 00:30:36.050

into the nucleus

00:30:36.050 --> 00:30:36.060
into the nucleus
 

00:30:36.060 --> 00:30:37.970
into the nucleus
it could target it for degradation we

00:30:37.970 --> 00:30:37.980
it could target it for degradation we
 

00:30:37.980 --> 00:30:40.520
it could target it for degradation we
don't know how this works but the idea

00:30:40.520 --> 00:30:40.530
don't know how this works but the idea
 

00:30:40.530 --> 00:30:42.620
don't know how this works but the idea
is that this protein by itself or maybe

00:30:42.620 --> 00:30:42.630
is that this protein by itself or maybe
 

00:30:42.630 --> 00:30:44.780
is that this protein by itself or maybe
with another protein somehow it blocks

00:30:44.780 --> 00:30:44.790
with another protein somehow it blocks
 

00:30:44.790 --> 00:30:47.720
with another protein somehow it blocks
the integration of the viral DNA so

00:30:47.720 --> 00:30:47.730
the integration of the viral DNA so
 

00:30:47.730 --> 00:30:49.880
the integration of the viral DNA so
trim5 alpha defines very precise steps

00:30:49.880 --> 00:30:49.890
trim5 alpha defines very precise steps
 

00:30:49.890 --> 00:30:51.440
trim5 alpha defines very precise steps
people are trying to sort out how this

00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:51.450
people are trying to sort out how this
 

00:30:51.450 --> 00:30:53.780
people are trying to sort out how this
works and maybe you could then target it

00:30:53.780 --> 00:30:53.790
works and maybe you could then target it
 

00:30:53.790 --> 00:30:57.260
works and maybe you could then target it
with an inhibitor of sorts alright let's

00:30:57.260 --> 00:30:57.270
with an inhibitor of sorts alright let's
 

00:30:57.270 --> 00:30:58.610
with an inhibitor of sorts alright let's
talk a little bit about transmission

00:30:58.610 --> 00:30:58.620
talk a little bit about transmission
 

00:30:58.620 --> 00:31:01.790

00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:21.570
blood transfusions three to five percent
 

00:32:21.570 --> 00:32:23.750
blood transfusions three to five percent
so contaminated blood where you don't

00:32:23.750 --> 00:32:23.760
so contaminated blood where you don't
 

00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:26.060
so contaminated blood where you don't
pick up the presence of virus and other

00:32:26.060 --> 00:32:26.070
pick up the presence of virus and other
 

00:32:26.070 --> 00:32:30.110
pick up the presence of virus and other
unknown mechanisms of transmission so

00:32:30.110 --> 00:32:30.120
unknown mechanisms of transmission so
 

00:32:30.120 --> 00:32:34.100
unknown mechanisms of transmission so
this is important HIV transmission in

00:32:34.100 --> 00:32:34.110
this is important HIV transmission in
 

00:32:34.110 --> 00:32:36.170
this is important HIV transmission in
most of the world is by heterosexual

00:32:36.170 --> 00:32:36.180
most of the world is by heterosexual
 

00:32:36.180 --> 00:32:41.030
most of the world is by heterosexual
transmission now how does that happen so

00:32:41.030 --> 00:32:41.040
transmission now how does that happen so
 

00:32:41.040 --> 00:32:42.770
transmission now how does that happen so
you would think immediately that it's

00:32:42.770 --> 00:32:42.780
you would think immediately that it's
 

00:32:42.780 --> 00:32:46.430
you would think immediately that it's
virus that is transmitted in in sexual

00:32:46.430 --> 00:32:46.440
virus that is transmitted in in sexual
 

00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:48.980
virus that is transmitted in in sexual
fluids but there's still some debate

00:32:48.980 --> 00:32:48.990
fluids but there's still some debate
 

00:32:48.990 --> 00:32:49.890
fluids but there's still some debate
over whether it's

00:32:49.890 --> 00:32:49.900
over whether it's
 

00:32:49.900 --> 00:32:52.590
over whether it's
virus or virus within cells or maybe

00:32:52.590 --> 00:32:52.600
virus or virus within cells or maybe
 

00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:54.390
virus or virus within cells or maybe
both we still I was just reading an

00:32:54.390 --> 00:32:54.400
both we still I was just reading an
 

00:32:54.400 --> 00:32:56.280
both we still I was just reading an
article this morning where they say we

00:32:56.280 --> 00:32:56.290
article this morning where they say we
 

00:32:56.290 --> 00:32:58.170
article this morning where they say we
still don't know the relative

00:32:58.170 --> 00:32:58.180
still don't know the relative
 

00:32:58.180 --> 00:33:01.200
still don't know the relative
contribution of free virus versus virus

00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:01.210
contribution of free virus versus virus
 

00:33:01.210 --> 00:33:03.900
contribution of free virus versus virus
within cells so this is a summary of

00:33:03.900 --> 00:33:03.910
within cells so this is a summary of
 

00:33:03.910 --> 00:33:06.000
within cells so this is a summary of
various studies where they looked for

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:06.010
various studies where they looked for
 

00:33:06.010 --> 00:33:09.950
various studies where they looked for
the virus in either cell free fluids or

00:33:09.950 --> 00:33:09.960
the virus in either cell free fluids or
 

00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:12.750
the virus in either cell free fluids or
infected cells so you can see

00:33:12.750 --> 00:33:12.760
infected cells so you can see
 

00:33:12.760 --> 00:33:16.470
infected cells so you can see
cerebrospinal fluid ear secretions etc

00:33:16.470 --> 00:33:16.480
cerebrospinal fluid ear secretions etc
 

00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:19.620
cerebrospinal fluid ear secretions etc
feces milk plasma plasma is a large one

00:33:19.620 --> 00:33:19.630
feces milk plasma plasma is a large one
 

00:33:19.630 --> 00:33:20.820
feces milk plasma plasma is a large one
and that's one of the ways you

00:33:20.820 --> 00:33:20.830
and that's one of the ways you
 

00:33:20.830 --> 00:33:22.320
and that's one of the ways you
transmitted of course by blood

00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:22.330
transmitted of course by blood
 

00:33:22.330 --> 00:33:25.980
transmitted of course by blood
transfusions semen also has virus in it

00:33:25.980 --> 00:33:25.990
transfusions semen also has virus in it
 

00:33:25.990 --> 00:33:28.920
transfusions semen also has virus in it
vaginal cervical secretions also contain

00:33:28.920 --> 00:33:28.930
vaginal cervical secretions also contain
 

00:33:28.930 --> 00:33:30.690
vaginal cervical secretions also contain
virus but you see some of these have

00:33:30.690 --> 00:33:30.700
virus but you see some of these have
 

00:33:30.700 --> 00:33:33.020
virus but you see some of these have
very little virus like like this one

00:33:33.020 --> 00:33:33.030
very little virus like like this one
 

00:33:33.030 --> 00:33:35.580
very little virus like like this one
infected cells peripheral blood

00:33:35.580 --> 00:33:35.590
infected cells peripheral blood
 

00:33:35.590 --> 00:33:38.820
infected cells peripheral blood
mononuclear cells these are the number

00:33:38.820 --> 00:33:38.830
mononuclear cells these are the number
 

00:33:38.830 --> 00:33:42.750
mononuclear cells these are the number
of positive samples out of the number

00:33:42.750 --> 00:33:42.760
of positive samples out of the number
 

00:33:42.760 --> 00:33:45.300
of positive samples out of the number
that were tested so 89 of 92 in this

00:33:45.300 --> 00:33:45.310
that were tested so 89 of 92 in this
 

00:33:45.310 --> 00:33:48.570
that were tested so 89 of 92 in this
case not much in saliva semen 11 out of

00:33:48.570 --> 00:33:48.580
case not much in saliva semen 11 out of
 

00:33:48.580 --> 00:33:51.300
case not much in saliva semen 11 out of
28 in vaginal and cervical fluid 7 of 16

00:33:51.300 --> 00:33:51.310
28 in vaginal and cervical fluid 7 of 16
 

00:33:51.310 --> 00:33:53.370
28 in vaginal and cervical fluid 7 of 16
so in these areas there are also

00:33:53.370 --> 00:33:53.380
so in these areas there are also
 

00:33:53.380 --> 00:33:55.800
so in these areas there are also
infected cells so the point the question

00:33:55.800 --> 00:33:55.810
infected cells so the point the question
 

00:33:55.810 --> 00:33:58.350
infected cells so the point the question
is whether it's virus or virus infected

00:33:58.350 --> 00:33:58.360
is whether it's virus or virus infected
 

00:33:58.360 --> 00:34:00.210
is whether it's virus or virus infected
cells that is transmitting the infection

00:34:00.210 --> 00:34:00.220
cells that is transmitting the infection
 

00:34:00.220 --> 00:34:02.040
cells that is transmitting the infection
is still not established very difficult

00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:02.050
is still not established very difficult
 

00:34:02.050 --> 00:34:04.110
is still not established very difficult
to do these kinds of studies and that's

00:34:04.110 --> 00:34:04.120
to do these kinds of studies and that's
 

00:34:04.120 --> 00:34:05.910
to do these kinds of studies and that's
an important question because remember

00:34:05.910 --> 00:34:05.920
an important question because remember
 

00:34:05.920 --> 00:34:08.490
an important question because remember
an antibody a vaccine that induces

00:34:08.490 --> 00:34:08.500
an antibody a vaccine that induces
 

00:34:08.500 --> 00:34:10.590
an antibody a vaccine that induces
antibodies will prevent invite free

00:34:10.590 --> 00:34:10.600
antibodies will prevent invite free
 

00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:12.270
antibodies will prevent invite free
viruses from in fact thing but it's not

00:34:12.270 --> 00:34:12.280
viruses from in fact thing but it's not
 

00:34:12.280 --> 00:34:13.500
viruses from in fact thing but it's not
going to have an effect on a virus

00:34:13.500 --> 00:34:13.510
going to have an effect on a virus
 

00:34:13.510 --> 00:34:15.330
going to have an effect on a virus
infected cell so you really have to

00:34:15.330 --> 00:34:15.340
infected cell so you really have to
 

00:34:15.340 --> 00:34:17.100
infected cell so you really have to
figure that out before you can design an

00:34:17.100 --> 00:34:17.110
figure that out before you can design an
 

00:34:17.110 --> 00:34:20.820
figure that out before you can design an
effective vaccine so this is a study

00:34:20.820 --> 00:34:20.830
effective vaccine so this is a study
 

00:34:20.830 --> 00:34:23.159
effective vaccine so this is a study
done in Uganda a number of years ago

00:34:23.159 --> 00:34:23.169
done in Uganda a number of years ago
 

00:34:23.169 --> 00:34:25.680
done in Uganda a number of years ago
which measured the probably probability

00:34:25.680 --> 00:34:25.690
which measured the probably probability
 

00:34:25.690 --> 00:34:28.490
which measured the probably probability
of HIV transmission per coital ACT in

00:34:28.490 --> 00:34:28.500
of HIV transmission per coital ACT in
 

00:34:28.500 --> 00:34:31.620
of HIV transmission per coital ACT in
monogamous heterosexual HIV discordant

00:34:31.620 --> 00:34:31.630
monogamous heterosexual HIV discordant
 

00:34:31.630 --> 00:34:34.770
monogamous heterosexual HIV discordant
couples so that means there were

00:34:34.770 --> 00:34:34.780
couples so that means there were
 

00:34:34.780 --> 00:34:36.600
couples so that means there were
monogamous as far as they told everyone

00:34:36.600 --> 00:34:36.610
monogamous as far as they told everyone
 

00:34:36.610 --> 00:34:38.669
monogamous as far as they told everyone
although people never admit it when

00:34:38.669 --> 00:34:38.679
although people never admit it when
 

00:34:38.679 --> 00:34:40.169
although people never admit it when
they're not that's the problem with all

00:34:40.169 --> 00:34:40.179
they're not that's the problem with all
 

00:34:40.179 --> 00:34:42.149
they're not that's the problem with all
of these studies and their HIV

00:34:42.149 --> 00:34:42.159
of these studies and their HIV
 

00:34:42.159 --> 00:34:44.100
of these studies and their HIV
discordant which means one partner is

00:34:44.100 --> 00:34:44.110
discordant which means one partner is
 

00:34:44.110 --> 00:34:46.350
discordant which means one partner is
HIV positive and the other is not so you

00:34:46.350 --> 00:34:46.360
HIV positive and the other is not so you
 

00:34:46.360 --> 00:34:49.230
HIV positive and the other is not so you
can follow these couples and ask what's

00:34:49.230 --> 00:34:49.240
can follow these couples and ask what's
 

00:34:49.240 --> 00:34:53.220
can follow these couples and ask what's
the probability of transmission and so

00:34:53.220 --> 00:34:53.230
the probability of transmission and so
 

00:34:53.230 --> 00:34:55.669
the probability of transmission and so
you see here depending on the viral load

00:34:55.669 --> 00:34:55.679
you see here depending on the viral load
 

00:34:55.679 --> 00:34:58.200
you see here depending on the viral load
HIV RNA copies per milliliter of blood

00:34:58.200 --> 00:34:58.210
HIV RNA copies per milliliter of blood
 

00:34:58.210 --> 00:35:00.480
HIV RNA copies per milliliter of blood
there is a very different transmission

00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:00.490
there is a very different transmission
 

00:35:00.490 --> 00:35:03.160
there is a very different transmission
rate so very low viral loads

00:35:03.160 --> 00:35:03.170
rate so very low viral loads
 

00:35:03.170 --> 00:35:04.799
rate so very low viral loads
there's there's very low transmission

00:35:04.799 --> 00:35:04.809
there's there's very low transmission
 

00:35:04.809 --> 00:35:08.789
there's there's very low transmission
but here you can see that with 1700 to

00:35:08.789 --> 00:35:08.799
but here you can see that with 1700 to
 

00:35:08.799 --> 00:35:12.069
but here you can see that with 1700 to
12,500 rnas per milliliter you have a

00:35:12.069 --> 00:35:12.079
12,500 rnas per milliliter you have a
 

00:35:12.079 --> 00:35:15.370
12,500 rnas per milliliter you have a
probability for 10000 chordal acts 10 at

00:35:15.370 --> 00:35:15.380
probability for 10000 chordal acts 10 at
 

00:35:15.380 --> 00:35:19.210
probability for 10000 chordal acts 10 at
roughly 10 10 and 10,000 and higher

00:35:19.210 --> 00:35:19.220
roughly 10 10 and 10,000 and higher
 

00:35:19.220 --> 00:35:21.039
roughly 10 10 and 10,000 and higher
probability if you have genital ulcer

00:35:21.039 --> 00:35:21.049
probability if you have genital ulcer
 

00:35:21.049 --> 00:35:22.870
probability if you have genital ulcer
diseases makes it easier for the virus

00:35:22.870 --> 00:35:22.880
diseases makes it easier for the virus
 

00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:24.490
diseases makes it easier for the virus
to get into your bloodstream of course

00:35:24.490 --> 00:35:24.500
to get into your bloodstream of course
 

00:35:24.500 --> 00:35:29.950
to get into your bloodstream of course
and these probabilities go up with more

00:35:29.950 --> 00:35:29.960
and these probabilities go up with more
 

00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:33.220
and these probabilities go up with more
virus in the blood and I think now the

00:35:33.220 --> 00:35:33.230
virus in the blood and I think now the
 

00:35:33.230 --> 00:35:35.349
virus in the blood and I think now the
the general rule of thumb is you have

00:35:35.349 --> 00:35:35.359
the general rule of thumb is you have
 

00:35:35.359 --> 00:35:38.670
the general rule of thumb is you have
about a 1 in 200 chance of contracting

00:35:38.670 --> 00:35:38.680
about a 1 in 200 chance of contracting
 

00:35:38.680 --> 00:35:43.150
about a 1 in 200 chance of contracting
HIV by sexual mechanisms okay based on

00:35:43.150 --> 00:35:43.160
HIV by sexual mechanisms okay based on
 

00:35:43.160 --> 00:35:44.680
HIV by sexual mechanisms okay based on
studies such as this so it's not

00:35:44.680 --> 00:35:44.690
studies such as this so it's not
 

00:35:44.690 --> 00:35:50.620
studies such as this so it's not
terribly infectious yes yeah

00:35:50.620 --> 00:35:50.630
terribly infectious yes yeah
 

00:35:50.630 --> 00:35:52.809
terribly infectious yes yeah
no no they have to tell them you have to

00:35:52.809 --> 00:35:52.819
no no they have to tell them you have to
 

00:35:52.819 --> 00:35:54.490
no no they have to tell them you have to
always advise people to have safe sex

00:35:54.490 --> 00:35:54.500
always advise people to have safe sex
 

00:35:54.500 --> 00:35:56.980
always advise people to have safe sex
and when you do vaccine trials you have

00:35:56.980 --> 00:35:56.990
and when you do vaccine trials you have
 

00:35:56.990 --> 00:35:58.809
and when you do vaccine trials you have
to do the same thing you have to give

00:35:58.809 --> 00:35:58.819
to do the same thing you have to give
 

00:35:58.819 --> 00:36:00.640
to do the same thing you have to give
them you know all the right advice but

00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:00.650
them you know all the right advice but
 

00:36:00.650 --> 00:36:02.799
them you know all the right advice but
there will always be people that don't

00:36:02.799 --> 00:36:02.809
there will always be people that don't
 

00:36:02.809 --> 00:36:04.780
there will always be people that don't
listen and that's where you get the data

00:36:04.780 --> 00:36:04.790
listen and that's where you get the data
 

00:36:04.790 --> 00:36:06.970
listen and that's where you get the data
from unfortunately yeah you're obligated

00:36:06.970 --> 00:36:06.980
from unfortunately yeah you're obligated
 

00:36:06.980 --> 00:36:10.599
from unfortunately yeah you're obligated
on ethical grounds to do that you have

00:36:10.599 --> 00:36:10.609
on ethical grounds to do that you have
 

00:36:10.609 --> 00:36:16.720
on ethical grounds to do that you have
to educate yeah ok so the reason some of

00:36:16.720 --> 00:36:16.730
to educate yeah ok so the reason some of
 

00:36:16.730 --> 00:36:19.120
to educate yeah ok so the reason some of
the reasons why transmission is not

00:36:19.120 --> 00:36:19.130
the reasons why transmission is not
 

00:36:19.130 --> 00:36:21.190
the reasons why transmission is not

00:36:21.200 --> 00:36:24.059
terribly effective in other routes is
because air drying reduces infectivity

00:36:24.059 --> 00:36:24.069
because air drying reduces infectivity
 

00:36:24.069 --> 00:36:26.770
because air drying reduces infectivity
heating so in very hot climates it's

00:36:26.770 --> 00:36:26.780
heating so in very hot climates it's
 

00:36:26.780 --> 00:36:29.140

Hardy virus and that goes brings us back
 

00:36:36.619 --> 00:36:38.530
Hardy virus and that goes brings us back
to structure and here again we have a

to structure and here again we have a
 

00:36:38.540 --> 00:36:40.599
to structure and here again we have a
virus which isn't very resistant so it

00:36:40.599 --> 00:36:40.609
virus which isn't very resistant so it
 

00:36:40.609 --> 00:36:42.520
virus which isn't very resistant so it
ends up being transmitted by roots that

00:36:42.520 --> 00:36:42.530
ends up being transmitted by roots that
 

00:36:42.530 --> 00:36:45.220
ends up being transmitted by roots that
don't require resistance to these kinds

00:36:45.220 --> 00:36:45.230
don't require resistance to these kinds

cd4 positive T cells so that's shown

00:37:05.829 --> 00:37:05.839
cd4 positive T cells so that's shown
 

00:37:05.839 --> 00:37:09.130
cd4 positive T cells so that's shown
here in green so here's a cd4 positive T

00:37:09.130 --> 00:37:09.140
here in green so here's a cd4 positive T
 

00:37:09.140 --> 00:37:11.319

that's needed for infection and remember

00:37:18.520 --> 00:37:18.530
that's needed for infection and remember
 

00:37:18.530 --> 00:37:21.160
that's needed for infection and remember
it's because fusion has to occur it can

kinds of strains of HIV that we define

00:37:27.520 --> 00:37:27.530
kinds of strains of HIV that we define
 

00:37:27.530 --> 00:37:29.260
kinds of strains of HIV that we define
within an infected individual

00:37:29.260 --> 00:37:29.270
within an infected individual
 

00:37:29.270 --> 00:37:32.800
within an infected individual
we have t-cell tropic strains and these

00:37:32.800 --> 00:37:32.810
we have t-cell tropic strains and these
 

00:37:32.810 --> 00:37:35.680
we have t-cell tropic strains and these
use a alpha chemokine receptor called

00:37:35.680 --> 00:37:35.690
use a alpha chemokine receptor called
 

00:37:35.690 --> 00:37:38.710
use a alpha chemokine receptor called
cxcr4 and then there are macrophage

00:37:38.710 --> 00:37:38.720
cxcr4 and then there are macrophage
 

00:37:38.720 --> 00:37:41.020

traffic strains that use a beta

00:37:41.020 --> 00:37:41.030
traffic strains that use a beta
 

00:37:41.030 --> 00:37:42.940
traffic strains that use a beta
chemokine receptor so just two different

00:37:42.940 --> 00:37:42.950
chemokine receptor so just two different
 

00:37:42.950 --> 00:37:45.760

Co receptors that define the two

00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:45.770
Co receptors that define the two
 

00:37:45.770 --> 00:37:47.290
Co receptors that define the two
different strains and I'm telling you

00:37:47.290 --> 00:37:47.300
different strains and I'm telling you
 

00:37:47.300 --> 00:37:49.120
different strains and I'm telling you
this because we have to talk about these

00:37:49.120 --> 00:37:49.130
this because we have to talk about these
 

00:37:49.130 --> 00:37:51.339
this because we have to talk about these
the evolution of these strains and so

00:37:51.339 --> 00:37:51.349
the evolution of these strains and so
 

00:37:51.349 --> 00:37:52.450
the evolution of these strains and so
you need to know what I'm talking about

00:37:52.450 --> 00:37:52.460
you need to know what I'm talking about
 

00:37:52.460 --> 00:37:54.280
you need to know what I'm talking about
alright so let's go through a typical

00:37:54.280 --> 00:37:54.290
alright so let's go through a typical
 

00:37:54.290 --> 00:37:58.809
alright so let's go through a typical
course of HIV so you get infected either

00:37:58.809 --> 00:37:58.819
course of HIV so you get infected either
 

00:37:58.819 --> 00:38:02.230
course of HIV so you get infected either
by free virus or virus containing cells

00:38:02.230 --> 00:38:02.240
by free virus or virus containing cells
 

00:38:02.240 --> 00:38:05.710
by free virus or virus containing cells
and the dendritic cells of course come

00:38:05.710 --> 00:38:05.720
and the dendritic cells of course come
 

00:38:05.720 --> 00:38:09.069
and the dendritic cells of course come
to the infected area and they interact

00:38:09.069 --> 00:38:09.079
to the infected area and they interact
 

00:38:09.079 --> 00:38:11.650
to the infected area and they interact
with virus which is what their job is so

00:38:11.650 --> 00:38:11.660
with virus which is what their job is so
 

00:38:11.660 --> 00:38:12.910
with virus which is what their job is so
you typically get infected with

00:38:12.910 --> 00:38:12.920
you typically get infected with
 

00:38:12.920 --> 00:38:14.859
you typically get infected with
macrophage atrophic strains the ones

00:38:14.859 --> 00:38:14.869
macrophage atrophic strains the ones
 

00:38:14.869 --> 00:38:17.170
macrophage atrophic strains the ones
that use that beta chemokine receptor

00:38:17.170 --> 00:38:17.180
that use that beta chemokine receptor
 

00:38:17.180 --> 00:38:19.000
that use that beta chemokine receptor
that I just showed you okay so not

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:19.010

worry about the name just the fact is
that the virus attaches to it doesn't go

00:38:44.770 --> 00:38:44.780
that the virus attaches to it doesn't go
 

00:38:44.780 --> 00:38:46.720
that the virus attaches to it doesn't go
into the dendritic cell though it just

00:38:46.720 --> 00:38:46.730
into the dendritic cell though it just
 

00:38:46.730 --> 00:38:49.180
into the dendritic cell though it just
attaches to it and lets the dendritic

00:38:49.180 --> 00:38:49.190
attaches to it and lets the dendritic
 

00:38:49.190 --> 00:38:52.210
attaches to it and lets the dendritic
cell take it into the lymph node which

00:38:52.210 --> 00:38:52.220
cell take it into the lymph node which
 

00:38:52.220 --> 00:38:54.700

situation for another virus that we
 

00:39:05.089 --> 00:39:07.510
situation for another virus that we
talked about previously so again it

00:39:07.510 --> 00:39:07.520
talked about previously so again it
 

00:39:07.520 --> 00:39:09.040
talked about previously so again it
doesn't the virus doesn't get into the

00:39:09.040 --> 00:39:09.050
doesn't the virus doesn't get into the

lymph node with the intent of delivering
 

00:39:18.680 --> 00:39:21.579
lymph node with the intent of delivering
this to T cell and the virus is going to

00:39:21.579 --> 00:39:21.589
this to T cell and the virus is going to
 

00:39:21.589 --> 00:39:24.490
this to T cell and the virus is going to
replicate in that T cell so the virus

00:39:24.490 --> 00:39:24.500
replicate in that T cell so the virus
 

00:39:24.500 --> 00:39:26.290
replicate in that T cell so the virus
then goes to lymphoid tissues where it

00:39:26.290 --> 00:39:26.300
then goes to lymphoid tissues where it
 

00:39:26.300 --> 00:39:28.300
then goes to lymphoid tissues where it
replicates you get a lot of virus

00:39:28.300 --> 00:39:28.310
replicates you get a lot of virus
 

00:39:28.310 --> 00:39:30.460
replicates you get a lot of virus
produced then the virus spreads to other

00:39:30.460 --> 00:39:30.470
produced then the virus spreads to other
 

00:39:30.470 --> 00:39:30.820

cd4 cells in which to replicate there is

00:39:37.120 --> 00:39:37.130
cd4 cells in which to replicate there is
 

00:39:37.130 --> 00:39:39.160
cd4 cells in which to replicate there is
an initial immune response and we'll

00:39:39.160 --> 00:39:39.170
an initial immune response and we'll
 

00:39:39.170 --> 00:39:41.230
an initial immune response and we'll
show some graphs of this and the immune

00:39:41.230 --> 00:39:41.240
show some graphs of this and the immune
 

00:39:41.240 --> 00:39:43.240
show some graphs of this and the immune
response is effective it down regulates

00:39:43.240 --> 00:39:43.250
response is effective it down regulates
 

00:39:43.250 --> 00:39:44.800
response is effective it down regulates
the virus load so you have initially a

00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:44.810
the virus load so you have initially a
 

00:39:44.810 --> 00:39:46.900
the virus load so you have initially a
peak of virus production and then we

00:39:46.900 --> 00:39:46.910
peak of virus production and then we
 

00:39:46.910 --> 00:39:49.120
peak of virus production and then we
have antibodies and and t-cells kicking

00:39:49.120 --> 00:39:49.130
have antibodies and and t-cells kicking
 

00:39:49.130 --> 00:39:51.040
have antibodies and and t-cells kicking
in and they limit infection but they

00:39:51.040 --> 00:39:51.050
in and they limit infection but they
 

00:39:51.050 --> 00:39:54.610
in and they limit infection but they
can't eliminate it entirely and after

00:39:54.610 --> 00:39:54.620
can't eliminate it entirely and after
 

00:39:54.620 --> 00:39:56.640
can't eliminate it entirely and after
about six months from the primary

00:39:56.640 --> 00:39:56.650
about six months from the primary
 

00:39:56.650 --> 00:39:59.230
about six months from the primary
infection you reach what's called the

00:39:59.230 --> 00:39:59.240
infection you reach what's called the
 

00:39:59.240 --> 00:40:01.540
infection you reach what's called the
viral set point and you have that level

00:40:01.540 --> 00:40:01.550
viral set point and you have that level
 

00:40:01.550 --> 00:40:02.860
viral set point and you have that level
of virus in your blood so you have

00:40:02.860 --> 00:40:02.870
of virus in your blood so you have
 

00:40:02.870 --> 00:40:04.480
of virus in your blood so you have
initial burst of virus and it reaches a

00:40:04.480 --> 00:40:04.490
initial burst of virus and it reaches a
 

00:40:04.490 --> 00:40:06.550
initial burst of virus and it reaches a
set point after about six months at

00:40:06.550 --> 00:40:06.560
set point after about six months at

depending on a variety of factors so

00:40:12.430 --> 00:40:12.440
depending on a variety of factors so
 

00:40:12.440 --> 00:40:14.470
depending on a variety of factors so
here's a wonderful eeehm this is a

00:40:14.470 --> 00:40:14.480
here's a wonderful eeehm this is a
 

00:40:14.480 --> 00:40:16.630
here's a wonderful eeehm this is a
dendritic cell in the lower right and

00:40:16.630 --> 00:40:16.640
dendritic cell in the lower right and
 

00:40:16.640 --> 00:40:21.310
dendritic cell in the lower right and
it's got HIV particles attached to it so

00:40:21.310 --> 00:40:21.320
it's got HIV particles attached to it so
 

00:40:21.320 --> 00:40:23.500
it's got HIV particles attached to it so
it's this dendritic cells picked up the

00:40:23.500 --> 00:40:23.510
it's this dendritic cells picked up the
 

00:40:23.510 --> 00:40:26.380
it's this dendritic cells picked up the
virus particles by DC sign and this

00:40:26.380 --> 00:40:26.390
virus particles by DC sign and this
 

00:40:26.390 --> 00:40:28.420
virus particles by DC sign and this
dendritic cell is interacting with a

dendritic cell is interacting with a
 

00:40:28.430 --> 00:40:31.390
dendritic cell is interacting with a
t-cell cd4 positive T cell which is what

00:40:31.390 --> 00:40:31.400
t-cell cd4 positive T cell which is what
 

00:40:31.400 --> 00:40:33.400
t-cell cd4 positive T cell which is what
the job of the dendritic cell is right

00:40:33.400 --> 00:40:33.410
the job of the dendritic cell is right
 

00:40:33.410 --> 00:40:36.250
the job of the dendritic cell is right
but inadvertently it's delivering virus

00:40:36.250 --> 00:40:36.260
but inadvertently it's delivering virus
 

00:40:36.260 --> 00:40:38.290
but inadvertently it's delivering virus
to the T cell these are cd4 positive T

to the T cell these are cd4 positive T
 

00:40:38.300 --> 00:40:40.510
to the T cell these are cd4 positive T
cells and the virus is now going to

00:40:40.510 --> 00:40:40.520
cells and the virus is now going to
 

00:40:40.520 --> 00:40:42.490
cells and the virus is now going to
infect the T cell so it's a cruel twist

00:40:42.490 --> 00:40:42.500
infect the T cell so it's a cruel twist
 

00:40:42.500 --> 00:40:45.130
infect the T cell so it's a cruel twist

leukocytes I'm not gonna ask you that

00:41:35.080 --> 00:41:35.090
leukocytes I'm not gonna ask you that
 

00:41:35.090 --> 00:41:36.250
leukocytes I'm not gonna ask you that
but you should know these words

00:41:36.250 --> 00:41:36.260
but you should know these words
 

00:41:36.260 --> 00:41:41.090
but you should know these words
how about thrombocytopenia what's that

00:41:41.090 --> 00:41:41.100
 
 

00:41:41.100 --> 00:41:45.140
 
mmm low platelets so infection can cause

00:41:45.140 --> 00:41:45.150
mmm low platelets so infection can cause
 

00:41:45.150 --> 00:41:47.300
mmm low platelets so infection can cause
that as well and you all know what your

00:41:47.300 --> 00:41:47.310
that as well and you all know what your
 

00:41:47.310 --> 00:41:51.080

liver is median duration about two weeks
 

00:41:51.090 --> 00:41:53.480
liver is median duration about two weeks
so these are primary infection symptoms

00:41:53.480 --> 00:41:53.490
so these are primary infection symptoms
 

00:41:53.490 --> 00:41:58.690
so these are primary infection symptoms

00:42:16.110 --> 00:42:17.980
collections of lymphoid tissue GI
associated lymphoid tissue all these

00:42:17.980 --> 00:42:17.990
associated lymphoid tissue all these
 

00:42:17.990 --> 00:42:20.210
associated lymphoid tissue all these
lumps here I mean these all look like

00:42:20.210 --> 00:42:20.220
lumps here I mean these all look like
 

00:42:20.220 --> 00:42:22.130

bowel this is the way it's supposed to

00:42:23.960 --> 00:42:23.970
bowel this is the way it's supposed to
 

00:42:23.970 --> 00:42:26.150
bowel this is the way it's supposed to
look these are full of lymphocytes these

00:42:26.150 --> 00:42:26.160
look these are full of lymphocytes these
 

00:42:26.160 --> 00:42:28.520
look these are full of lymphocytes these
are basically lymph nodes on the lining

00:42:28.520 --> 00:42:28.530
are basically lymph nodes on the lining
 

00:42:28.530 --> 00:42:31.420
are basically lymph nodes on the lining
of your bowel and in an individual

00:42:31.420 --> 00:42:31.430
of your bowel and in an individual
 

00:42:31.430 --> 00:42:35.840
of your bowel and in an individual
infected with HIV in this case the virus

00:42:35.840 --> 00:42:35.850
infected with HIV in this case the virus
 

00:42:35.850 --> 00:42:38.420
infected with HIV in this case the virus
was delivered into the colon after a few

00:42:38.420 --> 00:42:38.430
was delivered into the colon after a few
 

00:42:38.430 --> 00:42:41.360
was delivered into the colon after a few
weeks all these lymph nodes are gone the

00:42:41.360 --> 00:42:41.370
weeks all these lymph nodes are gone the
 

00:42:41.370 --> 00:42:43.160
weeks all these lymph nodes are gone the
virus has destroyed all of them by

00:42:43.160 --> 00:42:43.170
virus has destroyed all of them by
 

00:42:43.170 --> 00:42:45.440
virus has destroyed all of them by
replicating in cd4 positive T cells so

00:42:45.440 --> 00:42:45.450
replicating in cd4 positive T cells so
 

00:42:45.450 --> 00:42:47.330
replicating in cd4 positive T cells so
the bowel looks very clean but in fact

00:42:47.330 --> 00:42:47.340
the bowel looks very clean but in fact
 

00:42:47.340 --> 00:42:51.500
the bowel looks very clean but in fact
it shouldn't be that way so here's a

00:42:51.500 --> 00:42:51.510
it shouldn't be that way so here's a
 

00:42:51.510 --> 00:42:53.570
it shouldn't be that way so here's a
graph of the course of infection we've

00:42:53.570 --> 00:42:53.580
graph of the course of infection we've
 

00:42:53.580 --> 00:42:55.850
graph of the course of infection we've
just talked about this initial phase so

00:42:55.850 --> 00:42:55.860
just talked about this initial phase so
 

00:42:55.860 --> 00:42:57.290
just talked about this initial phase so
this actually looks like an acute

00:42:57.290 --> 00:42:57.300
this actually looks like an acute
 

00:42:57.300 --> 00:43:00.920
this actually looks like an acute
infection you get infected you have a a

00:43:00.920 --> 00:43:00.930
infection you get infected you have a a
 

00:43:00.930 --> 00:43:03.440
infection you get infected you have a a
rise in viral RNA on the bottom here

00:43:03.440 --> 00:43:03.450
rise in viral RNA on the bottom here
 

00:43:03.450 --> 00:43:06.230
rise in viral RNA on the bottom here
this is HIV RNA copies per mil of plasma

00:43:06.230 --> 00:43:06.240
this is HIV RNA copies per mil of plasma
 

00:43:06.240 --> 00:43:08.540
this is HIV RNA copies per mil of plasma
so you have a peak which goes down and

00:43:08.540 --> 00:43:08.550
so you have a peak which goes down and
 

00:43:08.550 --> 00:43:11.840
so you have a peak which goes down and
by about ten weeks or so and that could

00:43:11.840 --> 00:43:11.850
by about ten weeks or so and that could
 

00:43:11.850 --> 00:43:14.810
by about ten weeks or so and that could
just be an acute infection on the top

00:43:14.810 --> 00:43:14.820
just be an acute infection on the top
 

00:43:14.820 --> 00:43:18.250
just be an acute infection on the top
are some measurements of lymphocytes so

00:43:18.250 --> 00:43:18.260
are some measurements of lymphocytes so
 

00:43:18.260 --> 00:43:20.800
are some measurements of lymphocytes so
you can see here there's an issue

00:43:20.800 --> 00:43:20.810
you can see here there's an issue
 

00:43:20.810 --> 00:43:23.120
you can see here there's an issue
decrease in the number of lymphocytes so

00:43:23.120 --> 00:43:23.130
decrease in the number of lymphocytes so
 

00:43:23.130 --> 00:43:25.130
decrease in the number of lymphocytes so
a normal person about a thousand cd4

00:43:25.130 --> 00:43:25.140
a normal person about a thousand cd4
 

00:43:25.140 --> 00:43:27.680
a normal person about a thousand cd4
positive T cells per microliter and

00:43:27.680 --> 00:43:27.690
positive T cells per microliter and
 

00:43:27.690 --> 00:43:30.170
positive T cells per microliter and
there's an initial drop there caused by

00:43:30.170 --> 00:43:30.180
there's an initial drop there caused by
 

00:43:30.180 --> 00:43:32.030
there's an initial drop there caused by
the virus killing them it's replicating

00:43:32.030 --> 00:43:32.040
the virus killing them it's replicating
 

00:43:32.040 --> 00:43:35.240
the virus killing them it's replicating
in them there is an increase in cd8

00:43:35.240 --> 00:43:35.250
in them there is an increase in cd8
 

00:43:35.250 --> 00:43:37.430
in them there is an increase in cd8
positive T cells these are cytotoxic T

00:43:37.430 --> 00:43:37.440
positive T cells these are cytotoxic T
 

00:43:37.440 --> 00:43:39.200
positive T cells these are cytotoxic T
lymphocytes whose job it is to kill

00:43:39.200 --> 00:43:39.210
lymphocytes whose job it is to kill
 

00:43:39.210 --> 00:43:41.360
lymphocytes whose job it is to kill
virus infected cells so there's a burst

00:43:41.360 --> 00:43:41.370
virus infected cells so there's a burst
 

00:43:41.370 --> 00:43:42.950
virus infected cells so there's a burst
in those we think those are important

00:43:42.950 --> 00:43:42.960
in those we think those are important
 

00:43:42.960 --> 00:43:45.410
in those we think those are important
for controlling that initial viral level

00:43:45.410 --> 00:43:45.420
for controlling that initial viral level
 

00:43:45.420 --> 00:43:48.500
for controlling that initial viral level
and then the virus levels go down so

00:43:48.500 --> 00:43:48.510
and then the virus levels go down so
 

00:43:48.510 --> 00:43:51.740
and then the virus levels go down so
these immune responses by the way this

00:43:51.740 --> 00:43:51.750
these immune responses by the way this
 

00:43:51.750 --> 00:43:54.800
these immune responses by the way this
top purple line is C D all cd8 positive

00:43:54.800 --> 00:43:54.810
top purple line is C D all cd8 positive
 

00:43:54.810 --> 00:43:57.890
top purple line is C D all cd8 positive
t-cells and these are virus specific cd8

00:43:57.890 --> 00:43:57.900
t-cells and these are virus specific cd8
 

00:43:57.900 --> 00:44:00.500
t-cells and these are virus specific cd8
positive T cells all right so then the

00:44:00.500 --> 00:44:00.510
positive T cells all right so then the
 

00:44:00.510 --> 00:44:02.330
positive T cells all right so then the
virus is cleared are not clear but the

00:44:02.330 --> 00:44:02.340
virus is cleared are not clear but the
 

00:44:02.340 --> 00:44:04.880
virus is cleared are not clear but the
levels go quite far down by about ten

00:44:04.880 --> 00:44:04.890
levels go quite far down by about ten
 

00:44:04.890 --> 00:44:06.890
levels go quite far down by about ten
weeks and then you have a long period

00:44:06.890 --> 00:44:06.900
weeks and then you have a long period
 

00:44:06.900 --> 00:44:09.590
weeks and then you have a long period
where there's a low amount of virus and

00:44:09.590 --> 00:44:09.600
where there's a low amount of virus and
 

00:44:09.600 --> 00:44:12.200
where there's a low amount of virus and
there are really no symptoms but during

00:44:12.200 --> 00:44:12.210
there are really no symptoms but during
 

00:44:12.210 --> 00:44:14.210
there are really no symptoms but during
this period the virus is killing cd4

00:44:14.210 --> 00:44:14.220
this period the virus is killing cd4
 

00:44:14.220 --> 00:44:16.610
this period the virus is killing cd4
positive T cells the cd8 s remain

00:44:16.610 --> 00:44:16.620
positive T cells the cd8 s remain
 

00:44:16.620 --> 00:44:18.430
positive T cells the cd8 s remain
constant until the very end

00:44:18.430 --> 00:44:18.440
constant until the very end
 

00:44:18.440 --> 00:44:20.600
constant until the very end
and then when these reach a low level

00:44:20.600 --> 00:44:20.610
and then when these reach a low level
 

00:44:20.610 --> 00:44:23.270
and then when these reach a low level
now you have development of AIDS here

00:44:23.270 --> 00:44:23.280
now you have development of AIDS here
 

00:44:23.280 --> 00:44:25.970
now you have development of AIDS here
the blue shaded area this is where your

00:44:25.970 --> 00:44:25.980
the blue shaded area this is where your
 

00:44:25.980 --> 00:44:28.220
the blue shaded area this is where your
immune system can no longer repel other

00:44:28.220 --> 00:44:28.230
immune system can no longer repel other
 

00:44:28.230 --> 00:44:30.380
immune system can no longer repel other
pathogens and you get opportunistic

00:44:30.380 --> 00:44:30.390
pathogens and you get opportunistic
 

00:44:30.390 --> 00:44:32.870
pathogens and you get opportunistic
infections like the Pneumocystis that

00:44:32.870 --> 00:44:32.880
infections like the Pneumocystis that
 

00:44:32.880 --> 00:44:35.870
infections like the Pneumocystis that
was in the first slide and canada and

00:44:35.870 --> 00:44:35.880
was in the first slide and canada and
 

00:44:35.880 --> 00:44:38.960
was in the first slide and canada and
many other infections as well so the

00:44:38.960 --> 00:44:38.970
many other infections as well so the
 

00:44:38.970 --> 00:44:40.820
many other infections as well so the
number of T cells began to decline as

00:44:40.820 --> 00:44:40.830
number of T cells began to decline as
 

00:44:40.830 --> 00:44:42.980
number of T cells began to decline as
those decline you can no longer fight

00:44:42.980 --> 00:44:42.990
those decline you can no longer fight
 

00:44:42.990 --> 00:44:44.870
those decline you can no longer fight
off infection the T cells are also going

00:44:44.870 --> 00:44:44.880
off infection the T cells are also going
 

00:44:44.880 --> 00:44:47.920
off infection the T cells are also going
down virus RNA levels now rise

00:44:47.920 --> 00:44:47.930
down virus RNA levels now rise
 

00:44:47.930 --> 00:44:50.390
down virus RNA levels now rise
significantly towards the end this is

00:44:50.390 --> 00:44:50.400
significantly towards the end this is
 

00:44:50.400 --> 00:44:52.910
significantly towards the end this is
ten years now eight to ten years and

00:44:52.910 --> 00:44:52.920
ten years now eight to ten years and
 

00:44:52.920 --> 00:44:54.770
ten years now eight to ten years and
then they drop again because there are

00:44:54.770 --> 00:44:54.780
then they drop again because there are
 

00:44:54.780 --> 00:44:56.990
then they drop again because there are
no more cd4 positive cells for the virus

00:44:56.990 --> 00:44:57.000
no more cd4 positive cells for the virus
 

00:44:57.000 --> 00:44:59.570
no more cd4 positive cells for the virus
to replicate in and then eventually you

00:44:59.570 --> 00:44:59.580
to replicate in and then eventually you
 

00:44:59.580 --> 00:45:01.370
to replicate in and then eventually you
get a secondary infection and you die

00:45:01.370 --> 00:45:01.380
get a secondary infection and you die
 

00:45:01.380 --> 00:45:03.980
get a secondary infection and you die
from that so HIV doesn't kill you but

00:45:03.980 --> 00:45:03.990
from that so HIV doesn't kill you but
 

00:45:03.990 --> 00:45:05.720
from that so HIV doesn't kill you but
something else kills you because you

00:45:05.720 --> 00:45:05.730
something else kills you because you
 

00:45:05.730 --> 00:45:07.160
something else kills you because you
have no immune system left it's

00:45:07.160 --> 00:45:07.170
have no immune system left it's
 

00:45:07.170 --> 00:45:17.150
have no immune system left it's
completely destroyed it okay

00:45:17.150 --> 00:45:17.160
 
 

00:45:17.160 --> 00:45:19.860
 
yeah yeah we're making antibodies are

00:45:19.860 --> 00:45:19.870
yeah yeah we're making antibodies are
 

00:45:19.870 --> 00:45:21.240
yeah yeah we're making antibodies are
going to show you what's going on there

00:45:21.240 --> 00:45:21.250
going to show you what's going on there
 

00:45:21.250 --> 00:45:23.280
going to show you what's going on there
yeah there's a there's a give-and-take

00:45:23.280 --> 00:45:23.290
yeah there's a there's a give-and-take
 

00:45:23.290 --> 00:45:24.660
yeah there's a there's a give-and-take
with that whole time we make antibodies

00:45:24.660 --> 00:45:24.670
with that whole time we make antibodies
 

00:45:24.670 --> 00:45:26.280
with that whole time we make antibodies
the virus changes you make new

00:45:26.280 --> 00:45:26.290
the virus changes you make new
 

00:45:26.290 --> 00:45:27.930
the virus changes you make new
antibodies the virus changes so you

00:45:27.930 --> 00:45:27.940
antibodies the virus changes so you
 

00:45:27.940 --> 00:45:32.250
antibodies the virus changes so you
never eliminate all the virus so if you

00:45:32.250 --> 00:45:32.260
never eliminate all the virus so if you
 

00:45:32.260 --> 00:45:34.470
never eliminate all the virus so if you
take antiviral drugs you can keep

00:45:34.470 --> 00:45:34.480
take antiviral drugs you can keep
 

00:45:34.480 --> 00:45:36.420
take antiviral drugs you can keep
yourself at a very low level without

00:45:36.420 --> 00:45:36.430
yourself at a very low level without
 

00:45:36.430 --> 00:45:39.300
yourself at a very low level without
going into this aids phase basically and

00:45:39.300 --> 00:45:39.310
going into this aids phase basically and
 

00:45:39.310 --> 00:45:41.460
going into this aids phase basically and
you can live like that forever I don't

00:45:41.460 --> 00:45:41.470
you can live like that forever I don't
 

00:45:41.470 --> 00:45:43.290
you can live like that forever I don't
know about forever but whatever a normal

00:45:43.290 --> 00:45:43.300
know about forever but whatever a normal
 

00:45:43.300 --> 00:45:48.030
know about forever but whatever a normal
lifespan is so an established infection

00:45:48.030 --> 00:45:48.040
lifespan is so an established infection
 

00:45:48.040 --> 00:45:49.320
lifespan is so an established infection
which is that middle part you have

00:45:49.320 --> 00:45:49.330
which is that middle part you have
 

00:45:49.330 --> 00:45:51.420
which is that middle part you have
active viral replication it's low levels

00:45:51.420 --> 00:45:51.430
active viral replication it's low levels
 

00:45:51.430 --> 00:45:53.580
active viral replication it's low levels
but the virus is still replicating there

00:45:53.580 --> 00:45:53.590
but the virus is still replicating there
 

00:45:53.590 --> 00:45:55.830
but the virus is still replicating there
are major reservoirs where the virus is

00:45:55.830 --> 00:45:55.840
are major reservoirs where the virus is
 

00:45:55.840 --> 00:45:57.690
are major reservoirs where the virus is
replicating outside of the blood one of

00:45:57.690 --> 00:45:57.700
replicating outside of the blood one of
 

00:45:57.700 --> 00:45:59.940
replicating outside of the blood one of
them is the lymph nodes where the virus

00:45:59.940 --> 00:45:59.950
them is the lymph nodes where the virus
 

00:45:59.950 --> 00:46:01.980
them is the lymph nodes where the virus
replicates eventually destroys all the

00:46:01.980 --> 00:46:01.990
replicates eventually destroys all the
 

00:46:01.990 --> 00:46:03.990
replicates eventually destroys all the
lymph nodes all the cd4 positive cells

00:46:03.990 --> 00:46:04.000
lymph nodes all the cd4 positive cells
 

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:06.120
lymph nodes all the cd4 positive cells
in the lymph nodes gastrointestinal

00:46:06.120 --> 00:46:06.130
in the lymph nodes gastrointestinal
 

00:46:06.130 --> 00:46:08.400
in the lymph nodes gastrointestinal
tract lymph oh reticular tissues we shot

00:46:08.400 --> 00:46:08.410
tract lymph oh reticular tissues we shot
 

00:46:08.410 --> 00:46:10.260
tract lymph oh reticular tissues we shot
we saw a picture of that being destroyed

00:46:10.260 --> 00:46:10.270
we saw a picture of that being destroyed
 

00:46:10.270 --> 00:46:12.960
we saw a picture of that being destroyed
there's also reservoirs in the central

00:46:12.960 --> 00:46:12.970
there's also reservoirs in the central
 

00:46:12.970 --> 00:46:15.300
there's also reservoirs in the central
nervous system the genital tract there

00:46:15.300 --> 00:46:15.310
nervous system the genital tract there
 

00:46:15.310 --> 00:46:17.760
nervous system the genital tract there
are many many different kinds of viruses

00:46:17.760 --> 00:46:17.770
are many many different kinds of viruses
 

00:46:17.770 --> 00:46:20.190
are many many different kinds of viruses
they exist as a quasi species we'll talk

00:46:20.190 --> 00:46:20.200
they exist as a quasi species we'll talk
 

00:46:20.200 --> 00:46:22.560
they exist as a quasi species we'll talk
about what that means in evolution but

00:46:22.560 --> 00:46:22.570
about what that means in evolution but
 

00:46:22.570 --> 00:46:24.720
about what that means in evolution but
as this virus multiplies it mutates

00:46:24.720 --> 00:46:24.730
as this virus multiplies it mutates
 

00:46:24.730 --> 00:46:27.090
as this virus multiplies it mutates
extensively and you have huge

00:46:27.090 --> 00:46:27.100
extensively and you have huge
 

00:46:27.100 --> 00:46:29.610
extensively and you have huge
populations of diversify our viruses

00:46:29.610 --> 00:46:29.620
populations of diversify our viruses
 

00:46:29.620 --> 00:46:32.970
populations of diversify our viruses
every day you make 10 times 10 to the

00:46:32.970 --> 00:46:32.980
every day you make 10 times 10 to the
 

00:46:32.980 --> 00:46:35.730
every day you make 10 times 10 to the
ninth virion so during this middle phase

00:46:35.730 --> 00:46:35.740
ninth virion so during this middle phase
 

00:46:35.740 --> 00:46:37.950
ninth virion so during this middle phase
it's a huge amount of variants and then

00:46:37.950 --> 00:46:37.960
it's a huge amount of variants and then
 

00:46:37.960 --> 00:46:40.260
it's a huge amount of variants and then
they're destroyed in the same day huge

00:46:40.260 --> 00:46:40.270
they're destroyed in the same day huge
 

00:46:40.270 --> 00:46:44.130
they're destroyed in the same day huge
turnover of Furion's all right and that

00:46:44.130 --> 00:46:44.140
turnover of Furion's all right and that
 

00:46:44.140 --> 00:46:46.100
turnover of Furion's all right and that
gives you a lot of genetic diversity

00:46:46.100 --> 00:46:46.110
gives you a lot of genetic diversity
 

00:46:46.110 --> 00:46:48.450
gives you a lot of genetic diversity
that's what we mean by quasi species

00:46:48.450 --> 00:46:48.460
that's what we mean by quasi species
 

00:46:48.460 --> 00:46:51.810
that's what we mean by quasi species
half life of HIV and the plasma is less

00:46:51.810 --> 00:46:51.820
half life of HIV and the plasma is less
 

00:46:51.820 --> 00:46:55.020
half life of HIV and the plasma is less
than six hours so virus is made in six

00:46:55.020 --> 00:46:55.030
than six hours so virus is made in six
 

00:46:55.030 --> 00:46:57.270
than six hours so virus is made in six
hours later sometimes 30 minutes later

00:46:57.270 --> 00:46:57.280
hours later sometimes 30 minutes later
 

00:46:57.280 --> 00:47:00.420

it's gone so very rapid turnover during

00:47:00.420 --> 00:47:00.430
it's gone so very rapid turnover during
 

00:47:00.430 --> 00:47:03.120
it's gone so very rapid turnover during
that very that intermediate phase of

00:47:03.120 --> 00:47:03.130
that very that intermediate phase of
 

00:47:03.130 --> 00:47:06.180
that very that intermediate phase of
disease so this just shows you some of

00:47:06.180 --> 00:47:06.190
disease so this just shows you some of
 

00:47:06.190 --> 00:47:10.080
disease so this just shows you some of
the various cells that are compartments

00:47:10.080 --> 00:47:10.090
the various cells that are compartments
 

00:47:10.090 --> 00:47:12.210
the various cells that are compartments
for HIV replication in the blood on the

00:47:12.210 --> 00:47:12.220
for HIV replication in the blood on the
 

00:47:12.220 --> 00:47:14.670
for HIV replication in the blood on the
left here we have productively infected

00:47:14.670 --> 00:47:14.680
left here we have productively infected
 

00:47:14.680 --> 00:47:17.730
left here we have productively infected
cd4 positive lymphocytes and these are

00:47:17.730 --> 00:47:17.740
cd4 positive lymphocytes and these are
 

00:47:17.740 --> 00:47:19.770
cd4 positive lymphocytes and these are
just half-lives of these cells so these

00:47:19.770 --> 00:47:19.780
just half-lives of these cells so these
 

00:47:19.780 --> 00:47:22.170
just half-lives of these cells so these
are very short-lived cells in the blood

00:47:22.170 --> 00:47:22.180
are very short-lived cells in the blood
 

00:47:22.180 --> 00:47:25.710
are very short-lived cells in the blood
this the account for about 99 percent of

00:47:25.710 --> 00:47:25.720
this the account for about 99 percent of
 

00:47:25.720 --> 00:47:27.330
this the account for about 99 percent of
the virions that are made in the blood

00:47:27.330 --> 00:47:27.340
the virions that are made in the blood
 

00:47:27.340 --> 00:47:29.370
the virions that are made in the blood
have a very short half-life you see six

00:47:29.370 --> 00:47:29.380
have a very short half-life you see six
 

00:47:29.380 --> 00:47:31.500
have a very short half-life you see six
hours here and they can go on and infect

00:47:31.500 --> 00:47:31.510
hours here and they can go on and infect
 

00:47:31.510 --> 00:47:33.960
hours here and they can go on and infect
fresh cd4 positive lymphocytes which

00:47:33.960 --> 00:47:33.970
fresh cd4 positive lymphocytes which
 

00:47:33.970 --> 00:47:36.870
fresh cd4 positive lymphocytes which
continue to be made until they're

00:47:36.870 --> 00:47:36.880
continue to be made until they're
 

00:47:36.880 --> 00:47:40.200
continue to be made until they're
outpaced by viral destruction there are

00:47:40.200 --> 00:47:40.210
outpaced by viral destruction there are
 

00:47:40.210 --> 00:47:42.810
outpaced by viral destruction there are
also other compartments there are lately

00:47:42.810 --> 00:47:42.820
also other compartments there are lately
 

00:47:42.820 --> 00:47:44.610
also other compartments there are lately
infected lymphocytes in various other

compartments that we mentioned which

00:47:47.040 --> 00:47:47.050
compartments that we mentioned which
 

00:47:47.050 --> 00:47:49.140
compartments that we mentioned which
don't make virus but they have viral

don't make virus but they have viral
 

00:47:49.150 --> 00:47:50.550
don't make virus but they have viral
genomes in them that's what we mean by

00:47:50.550 --> 00:47:50.560
genomes in them that's what we mean by
 

00:47:50.560 --> 00:47:53.280
genomes in them that's what we mean by
latent ly infected and these have longer

00:47:53.280 --> 00:47:53.290
latent ly infected and these have longer
 

00:47:53.290 --> 00:47:54.930

cd8 have cd4 on them they may be
 

00:51:53.410 --> 00:51:55.050
cd8 have cd4 on them they may be
affected by the virus and that will end

00:51:55.050 --> 00:51:55.060
affected by the virus and that will end
 

00:51:55.060 --> 00:51:58.260

00:52:39.510 --> 00:52:39.520
lymph node and then the virus is going
 

00:52:39.520 --> 00:52:43.500
lymph node and then the virus is going
to go out into the blood the lymph node

00:52:43.500 --> 00:52:43.510
to go out into the blood the lymph node
 

00:52:43.510 --> 00:52:45.810
to go out into the blood the lymph node
upon getting dendritic cells in it that

a lot of lymphocytes so that they can go
 

00:52:52.270 --> 00:52:53.730
a lot of lymphocytes so that they can go
out into the blood and that's why early

destroyed by virus infection and that's

00:53:40.050 --> 00:53:40.060
destroyed by virus infection and that's
 

00:53:40.060 --> 00:53:41.520
destroyed by virus infection and that's
that's why in part you get

00:53:41.520 --> 00:53:41.530
that's why in part you get
 

00:53:41.530 --> 00:53:45.090

that's in about 30% of infections here's

00:54:30.570 --> 00:54:30.580
that's in about 30% of infections here's
 

00:54:30.580 --> 00:54:32.550
that's in about 30% of infections here's
a schematic of what we think is

happening in the central nervous system
 

00:54:34.150 --> 00:54:37.290
happening in the central nervous system
so the virus here's a virus particle

00:54:37.290 --> 00:54:37.300
so the virus here's a virus particle
 

00:54:37.300 --> 00:54:39.360
so the virus here's a virus particle
here is able to get into the CNS

00:54:39.360 --> 00:54:39.370
here is able to get into the CNS
 

00:54:39.370 --> 00:54:41.040
here is able to get into the CNS
remember a long time ago we talked about

00:54:41.040 --> 00:54:41.050
remember a long time ago we talked about
 

00:54:41.050 --> 00:54:44.070
remember a long time ago we talked about
the blood vein brain barrier to getting

00:54:44.070 --> 00:54:44.080
the blood vein brain barrier to getting
 

00:54:44.080 --> 00:54:46.800
the blood vein brain barrier to getting
into the CNS so these are endothelial

00:54:46.800 --> 00:54:46.810
into the CNS so these are endothelial
 

00:54:46.810 --> 00:54:48.810
into the CNS so these are endothelial
cells one ideas that the virus can cross

00:54:48.810 --> 00:54:48.820
cells one ideas that the virus can cross
 

00:54:48.820 --> 00:54:52.290
cells one ideas that the virus can cross
and athelia cells in the CNS the virus

00:54:52.290 --> 00:54:52.300
and athelia cells in the CNS the virus
 

00:54:52.300 --> 00:54:54.120
and athelia cells in the CNS the virus
can infect astrocytes

00:54:54.120 --> 00:54:54.130
can infect astrocytes
 

00:54:54.130 --> 00:54:57.930
can infect astrocytes
that can infect oligodendrocytes but it

00:54:57.930 --> 00:54:57.940
that can infect oligodendrocytes but it
 

00:54:57.940 --> 00:54:59.670
that can infect oligodendrocytes but it
does not infect and it can also infect

00:54:59.670 --> 00:54:59.680
does not infect and it can also infect
 

00:54:59.680 --> 00:55:03.410
does not infect and it can also infect
microglia but it cannot infect neurons

00:55:03.410 --> 00:55:03.420
microglia but it cannot infect neurons
 

00:55:03.420 --> 00:55:06.420
microglia but it cannot infect neurons
HIV doesn't infect neurons yet it does

00:55:06.420 --> 00:55:06.430
HIV doesn't infect neurons yet it does
 

00:55:06.430 --> 00:55:08.190
HIV doesn't infect neurons yet it does
produce neurological symptoms so the

00:55:08.190 --> 00:55:08.200
produce neurological symptoms so the
 

00:55:08.200 --> 00:55:10.020
produce neurological symptoms so the
idea is that all these infected cells

00:55:10.020 --> 00:55:10.030
idea is that all these infected cells
 

00:55:10.030 --> 00:55:13.260
idea is that all these infected cells
are producing a variety of cytokines and

00:55:13.260 --> 00:55:13.270
are producing a variety of cytokines and
 

00:55:13.270 --> 00:55:16.470
are producing a variety of cytokines and
perhaps viral proteins that give the

00:55:16.470 --> 00:55:16.480
perhaps viral proteins that give the
 

00:55:16.480 --> 00:55:19.830
perhaps viral proteins that give the
neuronal toxicity okay so this is just

00:55:19.830 --> 00:55:19.840
neuronal toxicity okay so this is just
 

00:55:19.840 --> 00:55:23.310
neuronal toxicity okay so this is just
an example of a macrophage infected

00:55:23.310 --> 00:55:23.320
an example of a macrophage infected
 

00:55:23.320 --> 00:55:26.640
an example of a macrophage infected
which is a microglia in the CNS if it's

00:55:26.640 --> 00:55:26.650
which is a microglia in the CNS if it's
 

00:55:26.650 --> 00:55:28.800
which is a microglia in the CNS if it's
infected with HIV it produces all of

00:55:28.800 --> 00:55:28.810
infected with HIV it produces all of
 

00:55:28.810 --> 00:55:31.170
infected with HIV it produces all of
these chemokines and cytokines and other

00:55:31.170 --> 00:55:31.180
these chemokines and cytokines and other
 

00:55:31.180 --> 00:55:34.080

cells are always making cytokines and

00:56:38.700 --> 00:56:38.710
cells are always making cytokines and
 

00:56:38.710 --> 00:56:40.380
cells are always making cytokines and
what is one of the things that cytokines

00:56:40.380 --> 00:56:40.390
what is one of the things that cytokines
 

00:56:40.390 --> 00:56:43.260
what is one of the things that cytokines
do is to stimulate cell division and

00:56:43.260 --> 00:56:43.270
do is to stimulate cell division and
 

00:56:43.270 --> 00:56:46.350
do is to stimulate cell division and
when cells divide uncontrollably that is

00:56:46.350 --> 00:56:46.360
when cells divide uncontrollably that is
 

00:56:46.360 --> 00:56:48.630
when cells divide uncontrollably that is
a recipe for cancer because the more

cells divide the more mutations

00:56:49.830 --> 00:56:49.840
cells divide the more mutations
 

00:56:49.840 --> 00:56:52.980
cells divide the more mutations
accumulate and eventually this the cell

00:56:52.980 --> 00:56:52.990
accumulate and eventually this the cell
 

00:56:52.990 --> 00:56:56.910
accumulate and eventually this the cell
will become tumorigenic and also other

00:56:56.910 --> 00:56:56.920

00:56:56.920 --> 00:57:00.860
will become tumorigenic and also other
viruses play into this as well so

00:57:00.860 --> 00:57:00.870
viruses play into this as well so
 

00:57:00.870 --> 00:57:03.740

virus human herpes virus 8 or Kaposi

00:57:49.320 --> 00:57:49.330
virus human herpes virus 8 or Kaposi
 

00:57:49.330 --> 00:57:53.420
virus human herpes virus 8 or Kaposi
sarcoma virus and in fact these

00:57:53.420 --> 00:57:53.430

Mediterranean men that had Kaposi

00:57:56.580 --> 00:57:56.590
Mediterranean men that had Kaposi
 

00:57:56.590 --> 00:58:02.160
Mediterranean men that had Kaposi
sarcoma before AIDS era also had hhv-8

00:58:02.160 --> 00:58:02.170
sarcoma before AIDS era also had hhv-8
 

00:58:02.170 --> 00:58:05.880
sarcoma before AIDS era also had hhv-8
so hhv-8 will cause Kaposi sarcoma but

00:58:05.880 --> 00:58:05.890
so hhv-8 will cause Kaposi sarcoma but
 

00:58:05.890 --> 00:58:08.280
so hhv-8 will cause Kaposi sarcoma but
people with AIDS are immunosuppressed so

00:58:08.280 --> 00:58:08.290
people with AIDS are immunosuppressed so
 

00:58:08.290 --> 00:58:09.750
people with AIDS are immunosuppressed so
they're more likely to be infected with

and so you get uncontrolled replication

00:58:42.630 --> 00:58:42.640
and so you get uncontrolled replication
 

00:58:42.640 --> 00:58:45.870
and so you get uncontrolled replication
and development of b-cell tumors so

00:58:45.870 --> 00:58:45.880

00:59:47.650 --> 00:59:49.910
the problems that we have which we've
already discussed if you have this early

00:59:49.910 --> 00:59:49.920
already discussed if you have this early
 

00:59:49.920 --> 00:59:52.980
already discussed if you have this early
acute phase of HIV infection where you

00:59:52.980 --> 00:59:52.990
acute phase of HIV infection where you
 

00:59:52.990 --> 00:59:54.390
acute phase of HIV infection where you
have a lot of virus which is eventually

00:59:54.390 --> 00:59:54.400
have a lot of virus which is eventually
 

00:59:54.400 --> 00:59:56.370
have a lot of virus which is eventually
cleared its cleared because of an immune

00:59:56.370 --> 00:59:56.380
cleared its cleared because of an immune
 

00:59:56.380 --> 00:59:58.319
cleared its cleared because of an immune
response you have a very nice antiviral

00:59:58.319 --> 00:59:58.329
response you have a very nice antiviral
 

00:59:58.329 --> 01:00:01.650
response you have a very nice antiviral
immunity and it's well it's not cleared

01:00:01.650 --> 01:00:01.660
immunity and it's well it's not cleared
 

01:00:01.660 --> 01:00:03.420
immunity and it's well it's not cleared
the levels are reduced but then you have

01:00:03.420 --> 01:00:03.430
the levels are reduced but then you have
 

01:00:03.430 --> 01:00:05.789
the levels are reduced but then you have
persistence so the one one question is

01:00:05.789 --> 01:00:05.799
persistence so the one one question is
 

01:00:05.799 --> 01:00:07.529
persistence so the one one question is
how does the virus persist despite

01:00:07.529 --> 01:00:07.539
how does the virus persist despite
 

01:00:07.539 --> 01:00:09.960
how does the virus persist despite
having good antibodies against it and

01:00:09.960 --> 01:00:09.970
having good antibodies against it and
 

01:00:09.970 --> 01:00:13.259
having good antibodies against it and
how does it eventually outstrip the

01:00:13.259 --> 01:00:13.269
how does it eventually outstrip the
 

01:00:13.269 --> 01:00:16.799
how does it eventually outstrip the
immune control and some of the questions

01:00:16.799 --> 01:00:16.809
immune control and some of the questions
 

01:00:16.809 --> 01:00:18.990
immune control and some of the questions
for which we don't really have answers

01:00:18.990 --> 01:00:19.000
for which we don't really have answers
 

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.089
for which we don't really have answers
yet and for which we do need answers

01:00:21.089 --> 01:00:21.099
yet and for which we do need answers
 

01:00:21.099 --> 01:00:23.190
yet and for which we do need answers
before we can make a vaccine do you need

01:00:23.190 --> 01:00:23.200
before we can make a vaccine do you need
 

01:00:23.200 --> 01:00:25.529
before we can make a vaccine do you need
antibodies for protection and recovery

01:00:25.529 --> 01:00:25.539
antibodies for protection and recovery
 

01:00:25.539 --> 01:00:27.569
antibodies for protection and recovery
do these have to be neutralizing

01:00:27.569 --> 01:00:27.579
do these have to be neutralizing
 

01:00:27.579 --> 01:00:29.099
do these have to be neutralizing
antibodies there's a lot of discussion

01:00:29.099 --> 01:00:29.109
antibodies there's a lot of discussion
 

01:00:29.109 --> 01:00:31.230
antibodies there's a lot of discussion
now maybe just they don't have to

01:00:31.230 --> 01:00:31.240
now maybe just they don't have to
 

01:00:31.240 --> 01:00:32.730
now maybe just they don't have to
neutralize in fact if 'ti maybe they

01:00:32.730 --> 01:00:32.740
neutralize in fact if 'ti maybe they
 

01:00:32.740 --> 01:00:34.890
neutralize in fact if 'ti maybe they
could just bind to the virus and let it

01:00:34.890 --> 01:00:34.900
could just bind to the virus and let it
 

01:00:34.900 --> 01:00:37.499
could just bind to the virus and let it
be taken up by other cell types do you

01:00:37.499 --> 01:00:37.509
be taken up by other cell types do you
 

01:00:37.509 --> 01:00:39.210
be taken up by other cell types do you
need me coastal immunity to prevent

01:00:39.210 --> 01:00:39.220
need me coastal immunity to prevent
 

01:00:39.220 --> 01:00:41.490
need me coastal immunity to prevent
infection or is an immunity in the blood

01:00:41.490 --> 01:00:41.500
infection or is an immunity in the blood
 

01:00:41.500 --> 01:00:44.249
infection or is an immunity in the blood
enough and do you need T cells we're not

01:00:44.249 --> 01:00:44.259
enough and do you need T cells we're not
 

01:00:44.259 --> 01:00:47.609
enough and do you need T cells we're not
even sure about that so here's an

01:00:47.609 --> 01:00:47.619
even sure about that so here's an
 

01:00:47.619 --> 01:00:48.180
even sure about that so here's an
example

01:00:48.180 --> 01:00:48.190
example
 

01:00:48.190 --> 01:00:51.510
example
what HIV does with respect to the

01:00:51.510 --> 01:00:51.520
what HIV does with respect to the
 

01:00:51.520 --> 01:00:53.339
what HIV does with respect to the
antibody response so you get infected

01:00:53.339 --> 01:00:53.349
antibody response so you get infected
 

01:00:53.349 --> 01:00:59.490
antibody response so you get infected
with a purple HIV here and it you make

01:00:59.490 --> 01:00:59.500
with a purple HIV here and it you make
 

01:00:59.500 --> 01:01:01.710
with a purple HIV here and it you make
antibodies against it you see the purple

01:01:01.710 --> 01:01:01.720
antibodies against it you see the purple
 

01:01:01.720 --> 01:01:03.990
antibodies against it you see the purple
antibodies here but by the time these

01:01:03.990 --> 01:01:04.000
antibodies here but by the time these
 

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.599
antibodies here but by the time these
antibodies are produced the virus has

01:01:06.599 --> 01:01:06.609
antibodies are produced the virus has
 

01:01:06.609 --> 01:01:08.579
antibodies are produced the virus has
changed to an orange virus so it's

01:01:08.579 --> 01:01:08.589
changed to an orange virus so it's
 

01:01:08.589 --> 01:01:10.710
changed to an orange virus so it's
mutated and these purple Ana the

01:01:10.710 --> 01:01:10.720
mutated and these purple Ana the
 

01:01:10.720 --> 01:01:13.220
mutated and these purple Ana the
antibodies no longer bind to the virus

01:01:13.220 --> 01:01:13.230
antibodies no longer bind to the virus
 

01:01:13.230 --> 01:01:16.380
antibodies no longer bind to the virus
so your body detects this orange virus

01:01:16.380 --> 01:01:16.390
so your body detects this orange virus
 

01:01:16.390 --> 01:01:18.660
so your body detects this orange virus
and starts to make orange antibodies but

01:01:18.660 --> 01:01:18.670
and starts to make orange antibodies but
 

01:01:18.670 --> 01:01:21.510
and starts to make orange antibodies but
by the time you do that you now have

01:01:21.510 --> 01:01:21.520
by the time you do that you now have
 

01:01:21.520 --> 01:01:24.270
by the time you do that you now have
blue HIV particles and this is what goes

01:01:24.270 --> 01:01:24.280
blue HIV particles and this is what goes
 

01:01:24.280 --> 01:01:26.339
blue HIV particles and this is what goes
on in that intervening period between

01:01:26.339 --> 01:01:26.349
on in that intervening period between
 

01:01:26.349 --> 01:01:29.730
on in that intervening period between
the acute infection and AIDS the virus

01:01:29.730 --> 01:01:29.740
the acute infection and AIDS the virus
 

01:01:29.740 --> 01:01:32.579
the acute infection and AIDS the virus
is always out stripping the antibodies

01:01:32.579 --> 01:01:32.589
is always out stripping the antibodies
 

01:01:32.589 --> 01:01:35.040
is always out stripping the antibodies
it's sort of like satchel page in a way

01:01:35.040 --> 01:01:35.050
it's sort of like satchel page in a way
 

01:01:35.050 --> 01:01:40.319
it's sort of like satchel page in a way
right and here is a graph of an

01:01:40.319 --> 01:01:40.329
right and here is a graph of an
 

01:01:40.329 --> 01:01:42.290
right and here is a graph of an
experiment which demonstrates this

01:01:42.290 --> 01:01:42.300
experiment which demonstrates this
 

01:01:42.300 --> 01:01:45.690
experiment which demonstrates this
specifically so we have a patient

01:01:45.690 --> 01:01:45.700
specifically so we have a patient
 

01:01:45.700 --> 01:01:49.380
specifically so we have a patient
infected with with HIV and we take serum

01:01:49.380 --> 01:01:49.390
infected with with HIV and we take serum
 

01:01:49.390 --> 01:01:53.359
infected with with HIV and we take serum
at the time a month zero 6 and 12 and

01:01:53.359 --> 01:01:53.369
at the time a month zero 6 and 12 and
 

01:01:53.369 --> 01:01:58.859
at the time a month zero 6 and 12 and
then we react that serie with month 0

01:01:58.859 --> 01:01:58.869
then we react that serie with month 0
 

01:01:58.869 --> 01:02:01.559
then we react that serie with month 0
virus from that same patient in month 12

01:02:01.559 --> 01:02:01.569
virus from that same patient in month 12
 

01:02:01.569 --> 01:02:07.200
virus from that same patient in month 12
virus okay so month 0 virus by 6 months

01:02:07.200 --> 01:02:07.210
virus okay so month 0 virus by 6 months
 

01:02:07.210 --> 01:02:09.150
virus okay so month 0 virus by 6 months
as of you make a very nice immune

01:02:09.150 --> 01:02:09.160
as of you make a very nice immune
 

01:02:09.160 --> 01:02:10.770
as of you make a very nice immune
response against it actually you have a

01:02:10.770 --> 01:02:10.780
response against it actually you have a
 

01:02:10.780 --> 01:02:13.440
response against it actually you have a
good immune response even at month 0 it

01:02:13.440 --> 01:02:13.450
good immune response even at month 0 it
 

01:02:13.450 --> 01:02:15.569
good immune response even at month 0 it
gets stronger and then it stays the same

01:02:15.569 --> 01:02:15.579
gets stronger and then it stays the same
 

01:02:15.579 --> 01:02:18.359
gets stronger and then it stays the same
by 6 and 12 months so 0 virus can be

01:02:18.359 --> 01:02:18.369
by 6 and 12 months so 0 virus can be
 

01:02:18.369 --> 01:02:21.599
by 6 and 12 months so 0 virus can be
neutralized 6 and 12 months out but the

01:02:21.599 --> 01:02:21.609
neutralized 6 and 12 months out but the
 

01:02:21.609 --> 01:02:23.849
neutralized 6 and 12 months out but the
problem is that at 12 months there is

01:02:23.849 --> 01:02:23.859
problem is that at 12 months there is
 

01:02:23.859 --> 01:02:26.339
problem is that at 12 months there is
another virus which is not neutralized

01:02:26.339 --> 01:02:26.349
another virus which is not neutralized
 

01:02:26.349 --> 01:02:30.240
another virus which is not neutralized
by the month 0 or month 6 and barely by

01:02:30.240 --> 01:02:30.250
by the month 0 or month 6 and barely by
 

01:02:30.250 --> 01:02:32.309
by the month 0 or month 6 and barely by
the month 12 plasma so this is a

01:02:32.309 --> 01:02:32.319
the month 12 plasma so this is a
 

01:02:32.319 --> 01:02:38.970
the month 12 plasma so this is a
practical showing of how the virus is

01:02:38.970 --> 01:02:38.980
practical showing of how the virus is
 

01:02:38.980 --> 01:02:41.460
practical showing of how the virus is
changing over time so that's one of the

01:02:41.460 --> 01:02:41.470
changing over time so that's one of the
 

01:02:41.470 --> 01:02:43.680
changing over time so that's one of the
problems the virus changes so quickly

01:02:43.680 --> 01:02:43.690
problems the virus changes so quickly
 

01:02:43.690 --> 01:02:46.650
problems the virus changes so quickly
that you can't neutralize it now what

01:02:46.650 --> 01:02:46.660
that you can't neutralize it now what
 

01:02:46.660 --> 01:02:49.140
that you can't neutralize it now what
would be the effect if at day 0 you had

01:02:49.140 --> 01:02:49.150
would be the effect if at day 0 you had
 

01:02:49.150 --> 01:02:50.579
would be the effect if at day 0 you had
neutralizing antibodies we don't know

01:02:50.579 --> 01:02:50.589
neutralizing antibodies we don't know
 

01:02:50.589 --> 01:02:52.050
neutralizing antibodies we don't know
because we don't have a vaccine that's

01:02:52.050 --> 01:02:52.060
because we don't have a vaccine that's
 

01:02:52.060 --> 01:02:54.420
because we don't have a vaccine that's
been able to do that yet and so we're

01:02:54.420 --> 01:02:54.430
been able to do that yet and so we're
 

01:02:54.430 --> 01:02:56.490
been able to do that yet and so we're
not even sure if you block all infection

01:02:56.490 --> 01:02:56.500
not even sure if you block all infection
 

01:02:56.500 --> 01:02:58.079
not even sure if you block all infection
whether it would the virus would still

01:02:58.079 --> 01:02:58.089
whether it would the virus would still
 

01:02:58.089 --> 01:03:09.130
whether it would the virus would still
evolve to overcome it yeah

01:03:09.130 --> 01:03:09.140
 
 

01:03:09.140 --> 01:03:23.570
 
Yeah right right

01:03:23.570 --> 01:03:23.580
 
 

01:03:23.580 --> 01:03:24.780
 
No

01:03:24.780 --> 01:03:24.790
No
 

01:03:24.790 --> 01:03:26.730
No
so the question is does this virus

01:03:26.730 --> 01:03:26.740
so the question is does this virus
 

01:03:26.740 --> 01:03:29.040
so the question is does this virus
change more rapidly than any other RNA

01:03:29.040 --> 01:03:29.050
change more rapidly than any other RNA
 

01:03:29.050 --> 01:03:31.350
change more rapidly than any other RNA
virus so the error rate is the same the

01:03:31.350 --> 01:03:31.360
virus so the error rate is the same the
 

01:03:31.360 --> 01:03:33.420
virus so the error rate is the same the
problem here is that every day you make

01:03:33.420 --> 01:03:33.430
problem here is that every day you make
 

01:03:33.430 --> 01:03:35.460
problem here is that every day you make
ten to the ten ten times ten to the

01:03:35.460 --> 01:03:35.470
ten to the ten ten times ten to the
 

01:03:35.470 --> 01:03:35.960
ten to the ten ten times ten to the
ninth

01:03:35.960 --> 01:03:35.970
ninth
 

01:03:35.970 --> 01:03:37.859
ninth
particles so you have a huge

01:03:37.859 --> 01:03:37.869
particles so you have a huge
 

01:03:37.869 --> 01:03:40.710
particles so you have a huge
productivity and turnover so if you make

01:03:40.710 --> 01:03:40.720
productivity and turnover so if you make
 

01:03:40.720 --> 01:03:42.780
productivity and turnover so if you make
one mistake for ten thousand bases

01:03:42.780 --> 01:03:42.790
one mistake for ten thousand bases
 

01:03:42.790 --> 01:03:44.700
one mistake for ten thousand bases
that's a huge number of mistakes so

01:03:44.700 --> 01:03:44.710
that's a huge number of mistakes so
 

01:03:44.710 --> 01:03:49.140
that's a huge number of mistakes so
every milliliter of blood has uncounted

01:03:49.140 --> 01:03:49.150
every milliliter of blood has uncounted
 

01:03:49.150 --> 01:03:51.870
every milliliter of blood has uncounted
numbers of mutations so it's a

01:03:51.870 --> 01:03:51.880
numbers of mutations so it's a
 

01:03:51.880 --> 01:03:54.180
numbers of mutations so it's a
particular kind of disease here that

01:03:54.180 --> 01:03:54.190
particular kind of disease here that
 

01:03:54.190 --> 01:03:58.410
particular kind of disease here that
lends it to this kind of escape this is

01:03:58.410 --> 01:03:58.420
lends it to this kind of escape this is
 

01:03:58.420 --> 01:04:00.570
lends it to this kind of escape this is
just another way of looking at the same

01:04:00.570 --> 01:04:00.580
just another way of looking at the same
 

01:04:00.580 --> 01:04:03.090
just another way of looking at the same
data these are again HIV escape these

01:04:03.090 --> 01:04:03.100
data these are again HIV escape these
 

01:04:03.100 --> 01:04:06.150
data these are again HIV escape these
are viruses taken at 0 3 6 etc all the

01:04:06.150 --> 01:04:06.160
are viruses taken at 0 3 6 etc all the
 

01:04:06.160 --> 01:04:07.590
are viruses taken at 0 3 6 etc all the
way out to twenty five months so these

01:04:07.590 --> 01:04:07.600
way out to twenty five months so these
 

01:04:07.600 --> 01:04:09.960
way out to twenty five months so these
are from HIV infected patients and these

01:04:09.960 --> 01:04:09.970
are from HIV infected patients and these
 

01:04:09.970 --> 01:04:12.270
are from HIV infected patients and these
are plasma taken at different times and

01:04:12.270 --> 01:04:12.280
are plasma taken at different times and
 

01:04:12.280 --> 01:04:14.400
are plasma taken at different times and
then you try and neutralize the virus

01:04:14.400 --> 01:04:14.410
then you try and neutralize the virus
 

01:04:14.410 --> 01:04:16.050
then you try and neutralize the virus
with the different plasma so every

01:04:16.050 --> 01:04:16.060
with the different plasma so every
 

01:04:16.060 --> 01:04:19.080
with the different plasma so every
plasma is incubated with every virus

01:04:19.080 --> 01:04:19.090
plasma is incubated with every virus
 

01:04:19.090 --> 01:04:21.930
plasma is incubated with every virus
sample to make this matrix and then you

01:04:21.930 --> 01:04:21.940
sample to make this matrix and then you
 

01:04:21.940 --> 01:04:23.670
sample to make this matrix and then you
mix the vibe the plasma with the virus

01:04:23.670 --> 01:04:23.680
mix the vibe the plasma with the virus
 

01:04:23.680 --> 01:04:24.960
mix the vibe the plasma with the virus
then you ask is the virus still

01:04:24.960 --> 01:04:24.970
then you ask is the virus still
 

01:04:24.970 --> 01:04:27.650
then you ask is the virus still
infectious that's a neutralization assay

01:04:27.650 --> 01:04:27.660
infectious that's a neutralization assay
 

01:04:27.660 --> 01:04:31.230
infectious that's a neutralization assay
so you can see the virus at zero months

01:04:31.230 --> 01:04:31.240
so you can see the virus at zero months
 

01:04:31.240 --> 01:04:34.859
so you can see the virus at zero months
is nicely neutralized by all of the Sira

01:04:34.859 --> 01:04:34.869
is nicely neutralized by all of the Sira
 

01:04:34.869 --> 01:04:37.830
is nicely neutralized by all of the Sira
from them about day three years from

about month three or so all the way out
 

01:04:39.550 --> 01:04:44.370
about month three or so all the way out
to 25 months but the virus at 25 months

01:04:44.370 --> 01:04:44.380
to 25 months but the virus at 25 months
 

01:04:44.380 --> 01:04:46.500
to 25 months but the virus at 25 months
you can see is poorly neutralized by the

01:04:46.500 --> 01:04:46.510
you can see is poorly neutralized by the
 

01:04:46.510 --> 01:04:48.090
you can see is poorly neutralized by the

just a standardized way of calculating a
 

01:05:14.530 --> 01:05:18.750
just a standardized way of calculating a
neutralization titer so here 50%

viral escaped mutants so CT ELLs
recognize specific viral epitopes the

01:06:01.320 --> 01:06:01.330
recognize specific viral epitopes the
 

01:06:01.330 --> 01:06:03.540
recognize specific viral epitopes the
virus can change those sequences as well

01:06:03.540 --> 01:06:03.550
virus can change those sequences as well
 

01:06:03.550 --> 01:06:05.250
virus can change those sequences as well
just like antibodies recognize an

just like antibodies recognize an
 

01:06:05.260 --> 01:06:07.470
just like antibodies recognize an
epitope and those viral epitopes can

01:06:07.470 --> 01:06:07.480
epitope and those viral epitopes can
 

01:06:07.480 --> 01:06:09.270
epitope and those viral epitopes can
change the same thing can happen with

01:06:09.270 --> 01:06:09.280
change the same thing can happen with
 

01:06:09.280 --> 01:06:11.760
change the same thing can happen with
CTL epitopes they can change as well so

01:06:11.760 --> 01:06:11.770
CTL epitopes they can change as well so
 

01:06:11.770 --> 01:06:14.490
CTL epitopes they can change as well so
we see that during the course of an HIV

01:06:14.490 --> 01:06:14.500
we see that during the course of an HIV
 

01:06:14.500 --> 01:06:17.490
we see that during the course of an HIV
infection you get CTL epitope changes so

01:06:17.490 --> 01:06:17.500
infection you get CTL epitope changes so
 

01:06:17.500 --> 01:06:20.790
infection you get CTL epitope changes so
that suggests that they're important now

01:06:20.790 --> 01:06:20.800

01:08:06.460 --> 01:08:09.150
very good at accommodating a wide range
of viral epitopes so here's an

01:08:09.150 --> 01:08:09.160
of viral epitopes so here's an
 

01:08:09.160 --> 01:08:12.079
of viral epitopes so here's an
experiment where we take CTLs away from

01:08:12.079 --> 01:08:12.089
experiment where we take CTLs away from
 

01:08:12.089 --> 01:08:16.170
experiment where we take CTLs away from
an animal this is a macaque infected

01:08:16.170 --> 01:08:16.180
an animal this is a macaque infected
 

01:08:16.180 --> 01:08:20.160
an animal this is a macaque infected
with HIV so in a normal situation you in

01:08:20.160 --> 01:08:20.170
with HIV so in a normal situation you in
 

01:08:20.170 --> 01:08:22.590
with HIV so in a normal situation you in
fact they have bursts of virus and then

01:08:22.590 --> 01:08:22.600
fact they have bursts of virus and then
 

01:08:22.600 --> 01:08:25.079
fact they have bursts of virus and then
the CTLs peak and clear the virus at the

01:08:25.079 --> 01:08:25.089
the CTLs peak and clear the virus at the
 

01:08:25.089 --> 01:08:27.300
the CTLs peak and clear the virus at the
same time but if you take away the CTL

01:08:27.300 --> 01:08:27.310
same time but if you take away the CTL
 

01:08:27.310 --> 01:08:30.240
same time but if you take away the CTL
which you can do experimentally you get

01:08:30.240 --> 01:08:30.250
which you can do experimentally you get
 

01:08:30.250 --> 01:08:32.280
which you can do experimentally you get
much more virus replication so again

01:08:32.280 --> 01:08:32.290
much more virus replication so again
 

01:08:32.290 --> 01:08:34.170
much more virus replication so again
this is just suggesting that CTL is in

01:08:34.170 --> 01:08:34.180
this is just suggesting that CTL is in
 

01:08:34.180 --> 01:08:35.700
this is just suggesting that CTL is in
addition to antibody are likely to be

01:08:35.700 --> 01:08:35.710
addition to antibody are likely to be
 

01:08:35.710 --> 01:08:39.300
addition to antibody are likely to be
important for protection so back to

01:08:39.300 --> 01:08:39.310
important for protection so back to
 

01:08:39.310 --> 01:08:42.030
important for protection so back to

individuals that as I said can last for
 

01:08:44.560 --> 01:08:47.249
individuals that as I said can last for
a number of years one in 300 infected

01:08:47.249 --> 01:08:47.259

people are likely to be elite

01:08:48.959 --> 01:08:48.969
people are likely to be elite
 

01:08:48.969 --> 01:08:50.519
people are likely to be elite
controllers and they're associated with

01:08:50.519 --> 01:08:50.529
controllers and they're associated with
 

01:08:50.529 --> 01:08:52.910

a number of months ago where the idea is

01:09:11.579 --> 01:09:11.589
a number of months ago where the idea is

so can you cure HIV infection you can

01:09:23.970 --> 01:09:23.980
so can you cure HIV infection you can
 

01:09:23.980 --> 01:09:28.200
so can you cure HIV infection you can
limit viral replication with antiviral

01:09:28.200 --> 01:09:28.210
limit viral replication with antiviral
 

01:09:28.210 --> 01:09:31.019
limit viral replication with antiviral
therapy but as I said there are

01:09:31.019 --> 01:09:31.029
therapy but as I said there are
 

01:09:31.029 --> 01:09:33.420

persistent reservoirs are of infection

01:09:33.420 --> 01:09:33.430
persistent reservoirs are of infection

there are long-lived memory T cells

01:09:35.070 --> 01:09:35.080
there are long-lived memory T cells
 

01:09:35.080 --> 01:09:38.130

marrow are elsewhere that have Pro viral
 

01:09:40.359 --> 01:09:42.690
marrow are elsewhere that have Pro viral
DNA in them and that's going to be very

01:09:42.690 --> 01:09:42.700
DNA in them and that's going to be very
 

01:09:42.700 --> 01:09:45.800
DNA in them and that's going to be very
difficult to eradicate so I think

01:09:45.800 --> 01:09:45.810
difficult to eradicate so I think
 

01:09:45.810 --> 01:09:48.269
difficult to eradicate so I think
prevention of infection is really going
