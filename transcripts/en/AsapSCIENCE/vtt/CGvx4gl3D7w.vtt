00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.230
Whether it’s the the first day of school,
a big interview or your wedding day - pimples

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:10.410
find a way of cropping up at the most inconvenient
times. But why do they occur and how do we

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:11.559
get rid of them?

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:15.620
The term “pore”, it is just another way
of saying “hair follicle”, and your body

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:20.199
is covered in them. Within the follicle is
a gland that produces an oily substance called

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:25.259
sebum, which empties onto the skin to keep
your hair and body moisturized. But if the

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:30.960
hair follicle becomes clogged with dead skin
cells and oils, a blockage is created. Sebum

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.770
continues to be produced but it is trapped
within the follicle making it become enlarged.

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:40.670
And this is where bacteria come into play,
feeding on the dead skin and sebum which can

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:45.840
unfortunately lead to infection. Your immune
system responds by sending blood to the area,

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.460
giving the appearance of redness and inflammation,
and white blood cells come to the site too,

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.680
to clear up the infection. When the white
blood cells die, they, combined with the dead

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.770
skin and sebum, create the pus filled pimple.

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:02.300
If the blockage occurs under the skin it creates
a white bump known as a “whitehead” and

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:07.329
if the blockage is above the skin and black
discolouration occurs it’s known as a “blackhead”.

00:01:07.329 --> 00:01:11.990
This is a result of melanin in the dead skin
cells reacting with oxygen creating a black

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:13.650
colour - it’s not dirt.

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.399
We get the most pimples when we are teens
due to the increased amount of androgen hormones

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:23.079
like testosterone in our bodies at the onset
of puberty. Testosterone sends the production

00:01:23.079 --> 00:01:28.969
of sebum into overdrive, increasing the incidence
of blockages. But zits can occur at any time

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:34.149
- often brought on by stressful events. Cortisol,
the stress hormone, increases the amount of

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:39.270
inflammation in your body (aka more red bumps
on your face) and can also suppress your immune

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.470
system, meaning your body can’t fight the
bacteria that is causing the acne.

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.600
So how do we fight the war on pimples? For
normal breakouts, cleaning your face to remove

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.450
excess oil which prevents pore blockage and
occasionally exfoliating to remove dead skin

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:58.479
will help, although acne often cannot be solved
this way. And it’s important to remember

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:03.590
that cleanliness and diet do not play a major
role in acne, but rather your genetics and

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:10.440
hormones. Many drugs exist like benzoyl peroxide
which kills specific acne causing bacteria,

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:15.460
salicylic acid which helps to remove dead
skin blockages, retinoids which reduce sebum

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:20.670
production and a variety of others; though
some drugs can have severe side effects. In

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.000
women, some success has been seen with oral
contraceptives, which decrease the ovaries

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.890
production of androgen hormones, ultimately
decreases sebum. Of course, consulting with

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:33.890
a doctor over which regimen is best suited
to you is always best.

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:38.310
But new therapies and cures may be on the
horizon with the help of science! By studying

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:43.550
individuals who do not get acne, scientists
noticed something: the bacteria that typically

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:48.990
causes acne still exists on their skin, but
it’s a different strain. It turns out that

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:54.400
this same bacteria with slightly different
genes causes healthier skin. Knowing this,

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:59.010
future therapies may include a deeper look
at the bacterial level, and whether or not

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.320
altering your skin microbiota could cure pimples.

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:05.930
We're really glad to be working in collaboration
with Bill and Melinda Gates in supporting

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:09.980
their Annual Letter this year called “Two
superpowers we wish we had”! Every year

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:14.060
they release a letter looking at global issues,
and this year the question is: what would

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:18.560
your superpower for good be? Would it be to
have more clean energy like Bill or more time

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.840
like Melinda, which means one thing in rich
countries and something else to the world’s

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:27.230
poorest families. It’s a chance to enact
positive change in the world – so find something

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:30.840
you’re passionate about and learn more about
it. Check out the letter with the link in

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:39.000
the description, and we'll be posting our
superpower ideas on instagram with #superpowerforgood.
