I'd say 23andme is so as much as we have
the reputation for being the consumer

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:14.080
the reputation for being the consumer
 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.260
the reputation for being the consumer
oriented company and we are consumer

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:16.270
oriented company and we are consumer
 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:18.650
oriented company and we are consumer
oriented were so heavy on the science

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660
oriented were so heavy on the science
 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.570
oriented were so heavy on the science
that to us it was it was sort of obvious

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:21.580
that to us it was it was sort of obvious
 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:22.980
that to us it was it was sort of obvious
you know of course you're going to want

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:22.990
you know of course you're going to want
 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:24.630
you know of course you're going to want
your genetic information we all want our

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:24.640
your genetic information we all want our
 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.400
your genetic information we all want our
genetic information why would you not

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:26.410
genetic information why would you not
 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:28.769
genetic information why would you not
want you netic information and I think

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:28.779
want you netic information and I think
 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:30.240
want you netic information and I think
that that's probably something that we

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:30.250
that that's probably something that we
 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:32.940
that that's probably something that we
we underestimated in terms of the fact

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:32.950
we underestimated in terms of the fact
 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:34.740
we underestimated in terms of the fact
that people don't really necessarily

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:34.750
that people don't really necessarily
 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:38.220
that people don't really necessarily
know exactly why you know what do they

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:38.230
know exactly why you know what do they
 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:39.540
know exactly why you know what do they
want to do with them from what do they

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:39.550
want to do with them from what do they
 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:41.060
want to do with them from what do they
want to do with the genetic information

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070
want to do with the genetic information
 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.369
want to do with the genetic information
why would they want it and and creating

00:00:44.369 --> 00:00:44.379
why would they want it and and creating
 

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:46.380
why would they want it and and creating
you know I think about other industries

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:46.390
you know I think about other industries
 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:48.150
you know I think about other industries
where it's been a big technology shift

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:48.160
where it's been a big technology shift
 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.910
where it's been a big technology shift
so something like tivo tivo was a big

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:50.920
so something like tivo tivo was a big
 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.709
so something like tivo tivo was a big
shift in how people watch TV but

00:00:52.709 --> 00:00:52.719
shift in how people watch TV but
 

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:55.529
shift in how people watch TV but
everyone understood the concept of TV no

00:00:55.529 --> 00:00:55.539
everyone understood the concept of TV no
 

00:00:55.539 --> 00:00:57.180
everyone understood the concept of TV no
one really understands the concept of

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:57.190
one really understands the concept of
 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:58.529
one really understands the concept of
why would I want my genetic information

00:00:58.529 --> 00:00:58.539
why would I want my genetic information
 

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:00.840
why would I want my genetic information
and and I think one of the other big

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:00.850
and and I think one of the other big
 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:03.890
and and I think one of the other big
challenges that we have is that people

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:03.900
challenges that we have is that people
 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:05.850
challenges that we have is that people
health care is not a true and just

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:05.860
health care is not a true and just
 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:07.320
health care is not a true and just
Healthcare's on a true free market

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:07.330
Healthcare's on a true free market
 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:09.270
Healthcare's on a true free market
because you are used to going to your

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:09.280
because you are used to going to your
 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.700
because you are used to going to your
doctor and saying you want x y and z and

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:11.710
doctor and saying you want x y and z and
 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:14.429
doctor and saying you want x y and z and
not paying for it and and so for that

00:01:14.429 --> 00:01:14.439
not paying for it and and so for that
 

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:16.170
not paying for it and and so for that
reason as telling people wow you can get

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:16.180
reason as telling people wow you can get
 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:18.149
reason as telling people wow you can get
access to your genetic information it's

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:18.159
access to your genetic information it's
 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:20.100
access to your genetic information it's
much cheaper than you know some of the

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:20.110
much cheaper than you know some of the
 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:21.960
much cheaper than you know some of the
other ways you could get it and it's all

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:21.970
other ways you could get it and it's all
 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:24.539
other ways you could get it and it's all
within your control that that's actually

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:24.549
within your control that that's actually
 

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:26.219
within your control that that's actually
a hardly for a lot of people because

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:26.229
a hardly for a lot of people because
 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:27.420
a hardly for a lot of people because
they're not used to paying for anything

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:27.430
they're not used to paying for anything
 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:29.670
they're not used to paying for anything
for healthcare so it's one of the things

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:29.680
for healthcare so it's one of the things
 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.980
for healthcare so it's one of the things
that we fat we've discovered that we

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:31.990
that we fat we've discovered that we
 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:35.340
that we fat we've discovered that we
have to educate people a lot more about

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:35.350
have to educate people a lot more about
 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:37.590
have to educate people a lot more about
you know preventative care why they

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:37.600
you know preventative care why they
 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.780
you know preventative care why they
should actually invest in that and what

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:39.790
should actually invest in that and what
 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:40.830
should actually invest in that and what
are things that they should do with the

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840
are things that they should do with the
 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:41.819
are things that they should do with the
information and the fact that they

00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:41.829
information and the fact that they
 

00:01:41.829 --> 00:01:43.230
information and the fact that they
actually are going to have to take a lot

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:43.240
actually are going to have to take a lot
 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.600
actually are going to have to take a lot
more responsibility for for their health

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:45.610
more responsibility for for their health
 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:47.940
more responsibility for for their health
and and that's a that's a pretty big

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:47.950
and and that's a that's a pretty big
 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:52.110
and and that's a that's a pretty big
adjustment for people

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:52.120
 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.290
I think there's huge those huge

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:54.300
I think there's huge those huge
 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.180
I think there's huge those huge
questions to to deal with it was funny

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:57.190
questions to to deal with it was funny
 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:58.920
questions to to deal with it was funny
early on in the company we engaged with

00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:58.930
early on in the company we engaged with
 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:01.320
early on in the company we engaged with
a number of different bioethicists and

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:01.330
a number of different bioethicists and
 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:02.370
a number of different bioethicists and
we actually talked about employing

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:02.380
we actually talked about employing
 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.080
we actually talked about employing
someone and then we actually couldn't

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.090
someone and then we actually couldn't
 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.120
someone and then we actually couldn't
get anyone to join because everyone

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.130
get anyone to join because everyone
 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:08.010
get anyone to join because everyone
found that this topic was so interesting

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:08.020
found that this topic was so interesting
 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:09.660
found that this topic was so interesting
that they felt that this was going to be

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670
that they felt that this was going to be
 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:12.600
that they felt that this was going to be
pivotal to their academic career so so

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610
pivotal to their academic career so so
 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:13.800
pivotal to their academic career so so
we've engaged with a number of people

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810
we've engaged with a number of people
 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:15.630
we've engaged with a number of people
we've gotten them to you know always

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640
we've gotten them to you know always
 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.360
we've gotten them to you know always
give us feedback on it but fundamentally

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370
give us feedback on it but fundamentally
 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:19.710
give us feedback on it but fundamentally
one things we've realized it's an

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720
one things we've realized it's an
 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.780
one things we've realized it's an
instant incredibly interesting area for

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790
instant incredibly interesting area for
 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.170
instant incredibly interesting area for
the ethics community to talk about you

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180
the ethics community to talk about you
 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.270
the ethics community to talk about you
know fundamentally what 23 Emmy believes

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280
know fundamentally what 23 Emmy believes
 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.340
know fundamentally what 23 Emmy believes
is that it's really about choice and if

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:29.350
is that it's really about choice and if
 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:30.810
is that it's really about choice and if
you want to get access to something that

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:30.820
you want to get access to something that
 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:33.030
you want to get access to something that
is fundamentally yours we believe it's

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040
is fundamentally yours we believe it's
 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.760
is fundamentally yours we believe it's
your right to get access to it it's not

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:35.770
your right to get access to it it's not
 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:38.250
your right to get access to it it's not
for everyone that's abundantly clear to

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260
for everyone that's abundantly clear to
 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:39.930
for everyone that's abundantly clear to
us and those people should not have to

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940
us and those people should not have to
 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.780
us and those people should not have to
do it and so you know 23 Emmy really

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790
do it and so you know 23 Emmy really
 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.720
do it and so you know 23 Emmy really
wants to encourage the debate we want to

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730
wants to encourage the debate we want to
 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:46.860
wants to encourage the debate we want to
encourage the debate we want to be a

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870
encourage the debate we want to be a
 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:48.630
encourage the debate we want to be a
participant in it we want to be

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640
participant in it we want to be
 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.180
participant in it we want to be
supportive of it and I think we remain

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190
supportive of it and I think we remain
 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:52.890
supportive of it and I think we remain
very firm and that we believe

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900
very firm and that we believe
 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.330
very firm and that we believe
individuals should have the right to get

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340
individuals should have the right to get
 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.300
individuals should have the right to get
access to this information and how it's

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310
access to this information and how it's
 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:00.240
access to this information and how it's
going to be used and what are the right

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250
going to be used and what are the right
 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:01.350
going to be used and what are the right
what are the good things or what are the

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360
what are the good things or what are the
 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.570
what are the good things or what are the
bad things that society really needs to

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:03.580
bad things that society really needs to
 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:05.280
bad things that society really needs to
have that debate and 23 Emmy will be

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290
have that debate and 23 Emmy will be
 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.530
have that debate and 23 Emmy will be
there but it's society to should put the

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540
there but it's society to should put the
 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:10.110
there but it's society to should put the
limits on it
