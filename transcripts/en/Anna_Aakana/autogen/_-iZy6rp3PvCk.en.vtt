00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.340
If there's one thing I think every day it's--

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:04.660
(Gasp!) I've made a horrible mistake.

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:08.720
Whether I'm hungover and see the drunk text messages that I sent the night before. (Shriek)

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:11.720
Or I ask I guy out to lunch and I get rejected. (Shriek)

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:15.040
Or I write a book called, "So Much I Want to Tell You, Letters to my Little Sister."

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:18.780
and I worry that everyone will hate it when it comes out on June 13th, 2017. Preorder at the link below!

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:19.640
(Ding!)

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:20.780
(Shriek)

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:26.200
There's this clichÃ© saying that you'll regret the things you didn't do, more than the ones that you did

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.200
And to that saying, I say

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:32.700
Have you met me? Do you know the sh*t I've done? I am full of regrets.

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:35.120
Oh my God, Anna you were so lit last night!

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:36.560
What?! Really?! Ugh.

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.640
Dude, I don't remember anything.

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.380
Time to check the Instastory...

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:41.780
(Dramatic sound effect) Oh no.

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:42.880
Oh yes!

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:43.740
Oh no!

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:44.240
Dude.

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.820
Check your Twitter.

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:48.840
OH NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:50.600
You flirt with Gaby Dunn so much,

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.520
like, when are you guys gonna hook up?

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:53.220
I don't know, Gaby.

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:55.220
You tell me... (ding)

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:55.960
But to be honest,

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:58.220
I'm really tired of hating myself.

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.720
And like,

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:01.600
Obsessing over everything that I do and say

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:02.960
And telling myself that it's wrong

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:04.120
And that everybody hates me.

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:04.820
'Cause it's like,

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:08.780
I could've probably read four REALLY big books

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.100
In the time that I've spent cringing over my own existence.

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.600
You know,

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.040
I could've been so much more productive;

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.160
I could've been writing

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:16.420
Or like, hanging out with friends

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:17.920
Or binging a Netflix series

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:19.920
Instead of just being stuck in my head.

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:20.800
What are you doing today?

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:22.980
Um... well, I have an audition in the afternoon...

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:23.960
And then I have a meeting...

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:25.620
And then I'm gonna spend the rest of the evening

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:26.120
Uh,

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:27.960
Remembering the time that I accidentally

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.160
Called my friends nerds

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:29.920
In like, a joking manner

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.220
But they kind of took it seriously

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:32.280
And then I hurt their feelings

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.160
And then I'm just gonna just, you know marinade in that

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:35.460
Embarrassment and shame for a bit.

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:36.820
... Oh.

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:37.800
Well, did you want to go to dinner?

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.180
(Tsk) No, I don't... I can't...

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.580
I really have to spend the evening hating myself.

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:44.380
I talked to my friend Mandy the other day,

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.280
about how I just feel so self-conscious

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.240
and self-aware of my every action,

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.800
and she kind of echoed the sentiment that she felt the same as well.

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.180
And it feels weird, it's like

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.620
Why do I feel like I've reverted into like,

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:59.680
a 15 year old teenager who's just desperate

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.060
for the approval of my peers?

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.660
Is this normal...?

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:03.960
And I don't what it is...

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.680
You know, maybe it's the human condition.

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.120
Maybe it's because 30 is around the corner

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:10.120
And this is adulthood's cruel joke that

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:12.240
High school is actually real life.

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:13.340
You think you're gonna leave, but

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:14.420
Nuh uh uh!

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.980
You're gonna perpetually be in the state of mind of being a teenager

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.540
Where you're analysing every single action that you take in hating yourself

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.060
Even though no one really cares.

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.840
So, yeah

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.520
I'm like, tired of feeling like I've made horrible mistakes.

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.120
Because to be honest, horrible mistakes are kind of really fun, right?

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.720
Like, bad decisions lead to good stories.

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:30.980
I really believe in that.

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.560
And I would rather just approach all of my mistakes

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.100
With confidence and like, being comfortable in my own skin

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:41.320
And not second-guessing every decision that do I make even though it goes horribly array.

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.080
And unfortunately, there's no real easy fix for this, right?

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.200
It's just re-wiring your thought patterns.

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.680
So what I have to work on, is every time I revert back into cringing over a past memory,

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.260
To catch myself, and be like:

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:53.920
"No! Not gonna do that!"

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.120
"Just let it go."

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:56.800
Because... to be honest,

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:59.320
No one's ever gonna dread of that memory except for me.

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:01.300
And I probably shouldn't.

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.240
'Cause it's just torturing myself.

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:04.500
I'm Anna Akana.

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.420
Stay awesome, Gotham.
