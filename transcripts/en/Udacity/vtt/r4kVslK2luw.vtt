Loading these TILEDmaps is actually a pretty complex process, so we're going to

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:08.392
walk through it piece by piece. First, to parse the JSON, you'll notice that

00:00:08.392 --> 00:00:12.552
we've actually modified our load function call to call parseMapJSON with the

00:00:12.552 --> 00:00:16.817
data we get from our xhr request. Now the data we've received from the internet

00:00:16.817 --> 00:00:20.636
is actually a JSON blob. The first thing we need to do is actually call

00:00:20.636 --> 00:00:25.204
JSON.parse, passing the JSON blob, to actually give us an object in Javascript.

00:00:25.204 --> 00:00:29.364
Next, what we'd like to do is to actually cache some of the values of this new

00:00:29.364 --> 00:00:33.585
JSON object inside of the map class itself, so, we don't have to keep walking

00:00:33.585 --> 00:00:37.935
through and querying that data object later on. The parameters we care about

00:00:37.935 --> 00:00:42.030
keeping track of right now are the total number of tiles crossing down in the

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.023
atlas. The size of each of those tiles in pixels, and then the size of the

00:00:46.023 --> 00:00:50.422
entire map in pixels. Now, once you've retrieved that data from our JSON object,

00:00:50.422 --> 00:00:53.252
go ahead and set the fullyLoaded attribute to true.
