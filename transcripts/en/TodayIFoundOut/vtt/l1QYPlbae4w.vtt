00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:06.720
The Tragic Family Life of Kelsey Grammer

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:19.860
Dr. Crane was a recurring character in seasons
3 and 4 and went on to become a regular in

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:23.140
season 5 until the series finale in season
11.

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:25.590
The end of Cheers was not the end for Kelsey
Grammer, however.

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.070
He continued to portray Dr. Frasier Crane
as the star of the popular television series,

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:33.190
Frasier from 1993 – 2004.

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:37.149
Although his professional life has been very
successful, he has struggled in his personal

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:39.879
life and experienced more than his fair share
of tragedies.

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:43.660
Kelsey Grammer’s parents were divorced when
he was 2 years old and his father, Frank Grammer,

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:47.609
owned a coffee shop and a bar-and-grill called
Greer’s Place.

00:00:47.609 --> 00:00:51.510
His mother brought Kelsey and Karen back to
her parents’ house in New Jersey where they

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.800
were raised by their mother and grandfather.

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.699
Unfortunately, his grandfather died when Kelsey
was 11.

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:02.809
On April 25, 1968, a man named Arthur B. Niles
set fire to Frank Grammer’s car outside

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:07.010
the St. Thomas home he shared with his second
wife, Elizabeth, and their four children (Betty,

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:08.630
John, Billy and Stephen).

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.820
When Frank Grammer went outside, Niles shot
him twice.

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.160
During the trial, Elizabeth Grammer testified
that she pulled her husband’s body from

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:18.640
in front of Niles’ car because he had threatened
to run over him as well.

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.190
Kelsey Grammer was only 13 years old at the
time of his father’s murder.

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:25.740
Niles was found not guilty of the murder by
reason of insanity and spent several decades

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.610
in a psychiatric ward.

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:31.910
In 1994, he was assessed to no longer be a
threat to society and was released.

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:36.771
In November of 2002, a judge issued a restraining
order against Niles which prevented him from

00:01:36.771 --> 00:01:37.920
seeing his son.

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.590
In March 2003, Niles went back to prison after
pleading guilty to threatening to kill that

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.960
same judge- no longer a threat indeed.

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.860
Seven years later, when Kelsey was 20 years
old, his younger sister, 18 year old Karen

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:55.040
Grammer, was raped by four men and murdered
by Freddie Lee Glenn.

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:00.300
Glenn, who was a civilian worker at Fort Carson
near Colorado Springs, Colorado began his

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:05.980
involvement in a killing spree on June 19,
1975 when he, and two soldiers, including

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:11.270
Michael Corbett, decided to assault Daniel
Van Lone, a Four Seasons Hotel cook who had

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:13.780
just gotten off work at the time they grabbed
him.

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.200
They then took him to a secluded area to kill
him.

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.560
Corbett shot him point blank in the head and
the trio made off with a whopping 50 cents

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:21.560
from the killing.

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.640
A little over a week later, Glenn and Corbett
met another Fort Carson soldier to sell some

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:26.640
pot to him.

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.880
Corbett had recently been training with bayonets,
and instead of making the sale, decided to

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:35.560
stab the soldier with a bayonet, supposedly
to see how it felt to stab someone.

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:41.000
On June 30, 1975, Karen Grammer was sitting
outside the Red Lobster in Colorado Springs,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.280
Colorado, where she had just finished her
shift as a waitress.

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:48.240
Glenn, Corbett and two friends had decided
to rob the Red Lobster Karen worked at that

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.990
night but left the restaurant without any
money when they came across Karen.

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:55.630
They forced her into their car, stopped to
rob a convenience store, then drove her to

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:58.740
their apartment where they took turns raping
her for about four hours.

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:02.130
Afterwards, they put a cloth over her head,
promising to take her home.

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:03.970
They dumped her in a trailer park instead.

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:08.069
According to testimony during the trial, Glenn
had taken LSD and when he got out of the car,

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:12.080
he stabbed Karen in the back, on her hand
(presumably from her trying to shield herself),

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:13.080
and the neck.

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.680
He then drove away with his accomplices, leaving
her for dead.

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:19.100
Karen was made of sterner stuff, though, and
managed to crawl to the back porch of a nearby

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:20.890
home that had a light on.

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:22.500
Unfortunately, no one was at home.

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.340
Detectives describe a scene where Karen had
left bloody handprints and fingerprints where

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.000
she had tried to ring the doorbell.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.330
From her fingerprints, she was inches away
from the doorbell when she passed out.

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:34.989
Although, given no one was home, ringing it
wouldn’t have done her any good, but of

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:36.250
course she didn’t know that.

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:39.630
She died on that back porch and was not found
until the next day.

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:43.880
Police did not know who the girl was for about
a week until Kelsey Grammer arrived and positively

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:45.209
identify her.

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:50.239
In 1976, Glenn was convicted for all three
murders and was sentenced to die via the gas

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:51.239
chamber.

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:55.280
However, in 1978, the Colorado Supreme Court
overturned the death penalty sentence.

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:00.989
Later, in a 2009 parole board hearing statement,
Kelsey stated, “She was so smart and good

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:01.989
and decent.

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:04.459
She wrote poetry … We could laugh for hours
together…

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:07.520
I was supposed to protect her — I could
not.

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:08.960
It very nearly destroyed me…

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:13.020
When we heard this man might be paroled, the
suffering began anew.”

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:15.380
Needless to say, his parole was not approved.

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:23.840
Glenn is eligible again for parole in 2014.

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:40.960
If that wasn’t all bad enough, five years
after Karen’s murder, on June 1, 1980, both

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:44.000
of Kelsey Grammer’s half brothers died unexpectedly.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.090
Stephen and Billy were scuba diving off of
St. Thomas at the time.

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:51.430
When Billy failed to resurface, Stephen went
back in after him but died of a fatal embolism

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:53.310
during an improper ascent that followed.

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:56.550
Billy’s body was never recovered.

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:00.550
Kelsey Grammer’s good friend and the producer
of Frasier, David Angell, died in the September

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:01.889
11 terrorist attacks.

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:06.270
Angell and his wife, Lynn, were both passengers
of American Airlines Flight 11, the first

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:24.060
plane to hit the World Trade Center.
