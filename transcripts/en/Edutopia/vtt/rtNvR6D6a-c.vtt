00:00:00.706 --> 00:00:11.496
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Whether they are
meeting with foreign ambassadors.

00:00:11.566 --> 00:00:14.856
&gt;&gt;Did that sort of brutality affect
any of your personal relationships?

00:00:15.376 --> 00:00:18.166
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Or creating
international forums in Second Life,

00:00:18.626 --> 00:00:21.756
members of Global Kids are
plugged in to the world.

00:00:22.426 --> 00:00:26.106
&gt;&gt;Carole: I was meeting young
people and asking them if they would

00:00:26.106 --> 00:00:28.136
like to learn about world affairs.

00:00:28.656 --> 00:00:30.646
And they said "Oh yes, please.

00:00:31.016 --> 00:00:32.876
You know we never get this in school.

00:00:33.226 --> 00:00:37.336
We'd like to know about the cultures
of the people in our classrooms

00:00:37.586 --> 00:00:40.966
and no one is ever really giving
us the opportunity to do that."

00:00:40.966 --> 00:00:42.606
&gt;&gt;You know because
getting some education,

00:00:43.336 --> 00:00:44.456
telling us about the world and stuff-

00:00:44.496 --> 00:00:48.906
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Created in 1989, Global
Kids conducts a variety of in-school

00:00:48.906 --> 00:00:52.866
and after-school programs at several
locations around New York City.

00:00:53.156 --> 00:00:55.136
Activities include the arts.

00:00:55.136 --> 00:00:56.786
&gt;&gt;Somebody pass me a blue marker.

00:00:57.386 --> 00:00:58.176
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Digital media.

00:00:58.176 --> 00:00:58.816
&gt;&gt;Computer program: Return
to school after a week

00:00:59.166 --> 00:01:03.436
but don't bother coming back if
you don't have the tuition fees.

00:01:03.436 --> 00:01:04.996
&gt;&gt;Narrator: And leadership classes

00:01:04.996 --> 00:01:07.806
that promote civic
participation and global awareness.

00:01:07.856 --> 00:01:11.036
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Can you think of one
global issue like a human rights

00:01:11.036 --> 00:01:14.616
or social justice issue and
write it on your Post-It.

00:01:14.716 --> 00:01:17.386
&gt;&gt;Narrator: In the Online
Leadership program students learn

00:01:17.386 --> 00:01:21.676
to use new media forms like
gaming and virtual environments

00:01:21.676 --> 00:01:23.586
to explore a larger world.

00:01:24.236 --> 00:01:27.206
&gt;&gt;Barry: We actually have a class
where the youth go into Second Life,

00:01:27.206 --> 00:01:30.456
it's a virtual world, and learn
about global sustainability issues,

00:01:30.656 --> 00:01:33.046
and then demonstrate what they
know within that same space.

00:01:33.296 --> 00:01:35.836
We still have a teacher here in
Brooklyn, but we also have a teacher

00:01:35.836 --> 00:01:38.926
in Scotland who being there in
Second Life co-teaches the class.

00:01:39.276 --> 00:01:42.706
And in that space for example, youth
aren't just using a virtual world.

00:01:42.776 --> 00:01:45.446
They're using a virtual world as
part of the larger Internet ecology.

00:01:46.016 --> 00:01:50.056
&gt;&gt;Student: Currently I'm working on
trying to put the scenes together-

00:01:50.096 --> 00:01:54.046
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The virtual video class
also takes place in Teen Second Life.

00:01:54.666 --> 00:01:55.256
&gt;&gt;Computer program:
Did you get a book?

00:01:55.256 --> 00:01:58.346
&gt;&gt;Computer program: Oh only the
Chinese students get those for free.

00:01:58.436 --> 00:01:59.196
&gt;&gt;Tabitha: Now the exciting part

00:01:59.196 --> 00:02:02.016
about their filmmaking is they're
not using real-life cameras.

00:02:02.176 --> 00:02:04.166
They're using everything virtual.

00:02:04.316 --> 00:02:07.956
So they're using Second Life which
is a virtual community as a platform.

00:02:08.216 --> 00:02:11.326
They're learning to work with each
other on coming up with a storyboard,

00:02:11.326 --> 00:02:14.326
everything from the preproduction
all the way to post-production,

00:02:14.326 --> 00:02:17.996
all the little steps
in making a film.

00:02:17.996 --> 00:02:20.626
&gt;&gt;...was basically the classroom.

00:02:20.626 --> 00:02:20.756
&gt;&gt;Tabitha: Okay.

00:02:20.806 --> 00:02:21.976
&gt;&gt;The first semester they're working

00:02:22.046 --> 00:02:24.716
on improving their digital
media delivery skills,

00:02:25.046 --> 00:02:27.336
and then in their second
half then they talk

00:02:27.336 --> 00:02:30.036
about what's the global issue
they want to raise awareness on.

00:02:30.216 --> 00:02:33.326
&gt;&gt;And then after he notices
so many injustices going

00:02:33.326 --> 00:02:36.126
on in China he decides
to leave with his mother

00:02:36.636 --> 00:02:38.746
through the Himalayan
Mountains and into India.

00:02:39.356 --> 00:02:42.056
&gt;&gt;Barry: One of the exciting things
about using digital media as a form

00:02:42.056 --> 00:02:44.926
of youth media is that not
only are the tools fascinating

00:02:44.926 --> 00:02:45.966
to work with for young people.

00:02:45.966 --> 00:02:48.516
They're very engaged around it and
they can learn important skills,

00:02:48.786 --> 00:02:51.086
but it means that their potential
audience is so much bigger.

00:02:51.226 --> 00:02:53.276
I mean the game that we
released three years ago,

00:02:53.276 --> 00:02:55.886
The Cost of Life has been played
in the past year and one-half

00:02:55.886 --> 00:02:57.516
about over one and
one-half million times.

00:02:58.526 --> 00:03:00.056
To have youth know that
their work can be heard

00:03:00.056 --> 00:03:01.466
by that many people
can make a difference,

00:03:02.046 --> 00:03:04.336
and if that many people can just
enjoy what they've done is a

00:03:04.336 --> 00:03:07.506
tremendously powerful experience
to move from being a consumer

00:03:07.576 --> 00:03:08.666
to being a critical creator.

00:03:08.666 --> 00:03:11.476
And when you become a critical
creator you then view yourself

00:03:11.476 --> 00:03:13.426
as a leader, one who can make
a difference in the world.

00:03:14.386 --> 00:03:16.706
&gt;&gt;We also visited the U.N.

00:03:16.706 --> 00:03:19.946
&gt;&gt;Carole: If young people
have the opportunity to learn

00:03:19.946 --> 00:03:24.626
about things they care about they
will be more motivated to read books.

00:03:24.626 --> 00:03:29.476
They'll be more motivated to take
action on things they care about,

00:03:29.476 --> 00:03:34.086
and they will see themselves
as players on the world stage

00:03:34.286 --> 00:03:36.666
and they'll understand
that in order to do that,

00:03:37.296 --> 00:03:39.016
they'll have to work
harder in school.

00:03:39.816 --> 00:03:44.906
So my approach to dropout prevention
was to turn young people on to things

00:03:44.956 --> 00:03:51.306
that they really cared about.

00:03:51.306 --> 00:03:51.976
And it actually has worked.

00:03:54.086 --> 00:03:56.716
