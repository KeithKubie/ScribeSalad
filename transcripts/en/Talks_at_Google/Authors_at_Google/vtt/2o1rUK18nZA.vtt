[APPLAUSE]

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:12.450
MARY ROACH: Hello-- hello.

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.260
I like the oriental carpet.

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.000
Last time I went around
doing a round of talks,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.610
someone had cut and paste into
my speaking contract something

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:25.600
from one of the
Food Network chefs

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:29.030
that required an oriental
carpet of certain dimensions

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:29.710
and flowers.

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:32.704
And they had to be all of one
particular blue, not another.

00:00:32.704 --> 00:00:34.370
I didn't know this
and I kept showing up

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:38.390
and people would be like hi, our
oriental carpet is a little too

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:39.314
small.

00:00:39.314 --> 00:00:41.710
And I was like, what
is wrong with people?

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:44.930
And then I found out that my
[INAUDIBLE], this had happened.

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:45.680
It was horrifying.

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:47.554
So I would show up and
go like, it wasn't me.

00:00:47.554 --> 00:00:48.820
It's not me.

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:51.270
Anyway.

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:52.290
Hello.

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:53.610
Hi.

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.740
It's lovely to be here.

00:00:55.740 --> 00:01:00.560
I've been at the Google,
the mothership down

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.560
in Silicon Valley, but
I've never been here.

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:05.239
And it's very nice.

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:10.170
So the book that I'm running
around town promoting

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.970
these days is called
"Grunt-- The Curious Science

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:17.110
of Humans at War," which
has kind of thrown people

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:18.800
a little bit because
it seems like sort

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:24.320
of a dark and somber
and serious topic.

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:25.670
And it can be.

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:30.760
But the angle that
I cover is-- I'm not

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:34.220
writing about weapons
and bombs and strategy.

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.470
I kind of leave that to the
Discovery Channel and Wired.com

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.630
and lots of other places that
do quite well covering that,

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:47.370
because the human body,
that's kind of my bag.

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:50.360
It is a bag, of sorts.

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:55.530
So I am covering sort
of the human experience

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:56.650
of being in combat.

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:02.650
So we're talking about lethal
heat and extreme noise and fear

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:07.010
and panic and maggots
and flies and diarrhea

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:09.479
and all these things you
don't necessarily associate

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.630
with military deployment.

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.890
Obviously the combat is what
comes to most people's minds.

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.520
And I got interested in
this book, I was it India.

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:25.500
And I was reporting a
story for Smithsonian

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.677
on the hottest chili--
arguably the hottest

00:02:28.677 --> 00:02:29.760
chili pepper in the world.

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.120
There are people who disagree.

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.880
But it's called
the Bhut jolokia.

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.290
And I was up in Nagaland, the
extreme northeast of India,

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:37.440
reporting this story.

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.240
And while I was
reporting on the pepper,

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:42.630
someone said, you know,
the Indian Defense Ministry

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:44.770
weaponized this pepper.

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:47.640
And I'm like, I need
to know about this.

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.610
And the science arm, one of the
science branches of the Indian

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:53.860
Defense Ministry is in the
neighboring state of Assam.

00:02:53.860 --> 00:03:00.160
So I went over there and talked
to folks about the pepper.

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.720
As it turns out, they never
deployed the pepper powder

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.510
because it was prone to mildew.

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:09.639
And so that sort of set
aside, while I was there,

00:03:09.639 --> 00:03:11.430
I was saying well what
else do you guys do.

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:15.390
And they were testing a
leech repellent that day,

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:16.340
or had been testing.

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:18.115
And I said, what's
that entailed.

00:03:18.115 --> 00:03:20.800
And he described going
down to the river

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:22.780
during monsoon season,
going down to the river,

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:25.051
rolling up their trousers,
trying on these leech

00:03:25.051 --> 00:03:25.550
repellents.

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:27.580
And I thought, god,
military science

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:30.292
it's kind of Mary Roachable.

00:03:30.292 --> 00:03:33.150
It's kind of not
what you would think.

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.650
And I had expected to spend more
time with the Indian Defense

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:39.740
Ministry, but they
had finished up

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:41.900
with the leech repellent
project and they were not

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:44.530
particular interested in
my poking around there.

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:48.590
So I came back to the
US and pursued it there,

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:50.730
and assumed that it
would be very, very

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:54.100
difficult to get access.

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:58.210
But in fact the Office
of the Secretary

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:01.000
of Defense of the United States
has a public affairs office

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.530
that deals with books.

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:05.950
And you can send them
a very brief, kind

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:09.012
of larval in my case
proposal saying this is

00:04:09.012 --> 00:04:10.220
what I'm interested in doing.

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:15.070
And they will sort of give
you kind of a generalized nod

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:16.352
of support.

00:04:16.352 --> 00:04:17.810
Now initially I
had thought that it

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:22.144
would be a very formal support
with embossed letters and gold

00:04:22.144 --> 00:04:23.810
trim and something
that I could present.

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:25.101
But in fact it's just an email.

00:04:25.101 --> 00:04:29.130
They could very easily have
taken out the not when they

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:32.860
said yes, we're fine with this.

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:34.690
Because as one of the
people there put it,

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:37.510
Mary Roach writing
about this science

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:41.520
is really not-- this is
not a big concern for us.

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.590
We're concerned about
"Zero Dark Thirty."

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:47.950
And we have other-- I'm just
sort of this trifling piffle.

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:52.120
Go and do your little science,
diarrhea whatever thing you're

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:54.830
going to do.

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:57.280
So people were fairly helpful.

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:00.410
It's also a side of
the military's work

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:04.100
that doesn't get
a lot of coverage.

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:07.630
And some of the work that
goes on is pretty cool.

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:11.170
And it's nice for
those people to get

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:13.680
a little bit of the spotlight.

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:17.700
So that's what
the book is about.

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:23.350
And I started out
the end of the book.

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:25.080
So it was kind of
strange process.

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:27.930
The first place I went was the
Armed Forces Medical Examiner

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:29.670
System in Dover.

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:33.929
And that's where the military's
main mortuary and morgue are.

00:05:33.929 --> 00:05:35.470
And when I went
there, I kind of knew

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:38.330
that this would probably
be the end of the book,

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:40.390
because it's a little dark.

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:45.060
It's a way to kind
of wrap up, in a way,

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:48.720
the various wanderings
of the book.

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:54.040
The science that I was reporting
on there was pretty amazing.

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:56.080
It's called feedback
from the field.

00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:01.840
And any time a body comes
in to the morgue in Dover,

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:02.850
it's given an autopsy.

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:04.010
All bodies are autopsied.

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:06.240
And what's different
about these bodies

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:08.160
is that all of the
lifesaving equipment

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:11.750
is left in place,
whether it was a needle

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:16.120
decompression for a collapsed
lung or a tourniquet.

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:18.850
And there's some new
technology in tourniquets,

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:22.950
or an airway device to
create a second airway.

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:25.200
All of that's left in place.

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:27.080
And it's part of the autopsy.

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:29.040
And then every month
there's something

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:35.210
called a combat
mortality teleconference

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:39.070
in which all the people at
the morgue and also some

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:43.860
of the research facilities, and
then the actual folks overseas

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:46.500
who had provided the
medical care, the emergency

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:48.560
medical care, all
of those people

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:50.310
are in this teleconference.

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:52.020
And they go case by case.

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:55.720
They take seven or eight
cases and they have slides.

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:59.270
And they discuss it with
the aim of identifying

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:02.270
things that have been
possibly going wrong,

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:05.080
equipment that isn't working
the way the manufacturer thought

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:09.070
or it wasn't placed properly,
just getting at the question,

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:11.630
is there anything that could
have been done differently,

00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:14.570
any way we might have
saved this person's life.

00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:17.310
So that was a really
interesting and of course very

00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:20.090
sobering afternoon.

00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:23.190
And one of the things they'd
recently figured out-- this

00:07:23.190 --> 00:07:24.960
was just kind of
an amazing thing

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:27.430
you don't really think about.

00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:31.270
The number one pastime on
these big bases in Afghanistan

00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:33.290
is body building.

00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:37.850
And some of the
soldiers, their pectorals

00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:43.440
are so buff that the needles
they were using for a needle

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:46.940
decompression, which
is if you've been shot

00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:50.450
and the air that you're inhaling
is ending up outside the lung,

00:07:50.450 --> 00:07:53.880
it can become difficult
to inhale and you can die.

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:57.080
It's, I think, the
second most common cause

00:07:57.080 --> 00:07:59.200
of fatality in combat.

00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:02.150
Anyway, so they
realized the needles

00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:05.310
weren't making their way
through the muscle to the space

00:08:05.310 --> 00:08:08.340
that they needed to
decompress that pressure.

00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:11.790
They were not sure why
this was-- what's going on?

00:08:11.790 --> 00:08:13.920
Why were these people dying?

00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:17.142
And so it was kind
of great that they

00:08:17.142 --> 00:08:19.350
were able to figure this
out, get the information out

00:08:19.350 --> 00:08:20.820
there quickly through
a teleconference

00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:22.650
rather than waiting
for somebody to publish

00:08:22.650 --> 00:08:27.030
a paper, which is usually the
traditional route to making

00:08:27.030 --> 00:08:28.155
that information available.

00:08:31.642 --> 00:08:33.100
And because it's
a Mary Roach book,

00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:36.539
people are like whoa, how's
she going to make that funny?

00:08:36.539 --> 00:08:37.929
How's this book going to work?

00:08:37.929 --> 00:08:43.400
So I ended up-- there's a
couple of historical chapters

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:48.240
that dealt with the-- they
both had to do the OSS, which

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:50.630
was the precursor to the CIA.

00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:53.990
And the OSS had some interesting
projects in World War II,

00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:57.840
including something
called Who Me?,

00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:03.954
which was a foul
smell in a tube.

00:09:03.954 --> 00:09:05.370
The idea would be
to distribute it

00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:09.290
to resistance groups
in occupied countries.

00:09:09.290 --> 00:09:12.810
And so motivated citizens could
go up behind a German officer

00:09:12.810 --> 00:09:18.600
and discreetly squeeze, fire
this tube and spray this.

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:21.020
And it was interesting
because the language was all

00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:22.160
describing it as a weapon.

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:25.780
They had specs, like it has
to be lastingly penetrative.

00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:31.480
It has to withstand rain,
dry cleaning solvents.

00:09:35.130 --> 00:09:37.130
There was a range
that it had to cover.

00:09:37.130 --> 00:09:39.140
And it had to do
this at-- it had

00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:42.770
to stink for at least
two hours at 70 degrees

00:09:42.770 --> 00:09:44.220
Fahrenheit at a certain level.

00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:46.160
And the whole thing
was sort of documented.

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:48.292
And they'd hired out
this chemistry company

00:09:48.292 --> 00:09:49.000
to figure it out.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.291
And there were all these
memos that went back and forth

00:09:51.291 --> 00:09:53.250
about what is a stink.

00:09:53.250 --> 00:09:56.270
It's all in the
context actually,

00:09:56.270 --> 00:09:59.950
because something like
butyric acid could smell.

00:09:59.950 --> 00:10:03.890
If you're in a deli it would
smell like Parmesan cheese.

00:10:03.890 --> 00:10:06.960
But if you're not in a deli,
it smells like dirty feet

00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:10.440
I think it is, unless it's
vomit-- anyway, vomit.

00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:12.740
So they were looking
for something that

00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:16.710
would be universally repellent.

00:10:16.710 --> 00:10:18.890
So there was all these
conversations back and forth.

00:10:18.890 --> 00:10:22.910
Oh yeah, the other example in
this memo about what is a stink

00:10:22.910 --> 00:10:28.600
was trimethylamine, which
is a fishy smell which

00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:33.070
could be pleasant or unpleasant
according to circumstances.

00:10:33.070 --> 00:10:36.420
And trimethylamine is,
in the tampon world,

00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:41.197
used for testing the powers
of deodorant of the product

00:10:41.197 --> 00:10:41.780
that you have.

00:10:41.780 --> 00:10:43.100
Anyway, enough said.

00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:48.980
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:52.240
Anyway, the tubes,
there were all manner

00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:55.670
of problems with backfire.

00:10:55.670 --> 00:10:57.500
The weapon was backfiring.

00:10:57.500 --> 00:11:01.080
The tubes, the little lead tube,
the crimping wouldn't hold.

00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:03.060
There was one guy
who, at the OSS,

00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:06.484
actually set up a
mannequin with a uniform.

00:11:06.484 --> 00:11:08.900
And he took a box of the tubes
and he tried to spray them.

00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:11.250
There's this very testy memo
saying that most of them

00:11:11.250 --> 00:11:13.360
had sprayed back at him.

00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:16.010
And anyway, it was just
sort of a delightful chapter

00:11:16.010 --> 00:11:22.130
in military espionage
and goings on.

00:11:22.130 --> 00:11:24.520
So the Who Me?

00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:29.750
Was-- the tradition of bad
smells as nonlethal weapons

00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:33.370
has carried on at the Monell
Chemical Senses Center

00:11:33.370 --> 00:11:38.560
where I spent some time
there in the late '90s.

00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:41.520
The Joint Non-Lethal
Weapons Directorate

00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:45.390
commissioned sensory chemists,
as in smell and taste,

00:11:45.390 --> 00:11:50.270
at Monell to come up with a
universally horrible smell.

00:11:50.270 --> 00:11:54.640
And this woman Pam Dalton
went around gathering data,

00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:55.590
all over the world.

00:11:55.590 --> 00:11:59.340
She had, in her suitcase,
she had little bottles

00:11:59.340 --> 00:12:05.520
labeled burnt hair, sewage, US
government standard bathroom

00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:10.490
malodor, garbage, sewage.

00:12:10.490 --> 00:12:12.620
She was doing a
project in South Africa

00:12:12.620 --> 00:12:15.450
and she thought, well I can get
some more cross-cultural data

00:12:15.450 --> 00:12:15.949
here.

00:12:15.949 --> 00:12:17.990
And she had this 15 hour flight.

00:12:17.990 --> 00:12:20.680
And in her carry on she
had all of her smells.

00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:25.070
And she describes getting up
from her seat after three hours

00:12:25.070 --> 00:12:26.520
to go to the
bathroom, standing up

00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:29.685
so her nose is about the
height of the overhead luggage

00:12:29.685 --> 00:12:33.000
and going oh my god,
those are my smells.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.100
She forgot about the change in
pressure and they were leaking.

00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:38.720
And so she said to her seatmate,
you cannot open this overhead

00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:40.160
bin for the entire 15 hours.

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:43.440
Everything you have at your
feet, that's all we can have.

00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:44.860
And then she did this.

00:12:44.860 --> 00:12:48.120
When we land, I don't
know what I'm going to do.

00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:48.790
So they land.

00:12:48.790 --> 00:12:51.440
She waits for the doors
to be open on the plane

00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:54.940
before she opens the overhead
so that people will go huh,

00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:57.545
I guess that's just how it
smells here or something.

00:13:01.070 --> 00:13:04.730
And in the end, the
winner among burnt hair,

00:13:04.730 --> 00:13:07.680
which was kind of a stand
in for burning body, which

00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:10.260
was thought that would
be universally abhorred.

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:12.700
But in fact when you
interviewed some-- there

00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:16.210
were all these different
cultural groups that

00:13:16.210 --> 00:13:19.710
had to say, is this pleasant,
unpleasant, wearable.

00:13:19.710 --> 00:13:21.719
Is it a wearable
scent, an edible scent?

00:13:21.719 --> 00:13:23.510
And for every one of
these horrible scents,

00:13:23.510 --> 00:13:26.009
there would be some group that
was like yeah, I'd wear that.

00:13:26.009 --> 00:13:27.320
I'd wear that as perfume.

00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:30.620
I'd eat that, because
it's all out of context.

00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:33.680
The one that just upset
and horrified everyone

00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:36.480
was US government
standard bathroom malodor,

00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:37.610
which you can still get.

00:13:37.610 --> 00:13:43.900
And that is something
that was devised to-- they

00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:47.720
were trying to come up with
a deodorizer for latrines

00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:49.440
in World War II.

00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:53.990
Some of the open pit latrines,
really nasty smell, intense.

00:13:53.990 --> 00:13:56.050
So they tried to mimic
that smell so they could

00:13:56.050 --> 00:13:57.570
test deodorizing compounds.

00:13:57.570 --> 00:13:59.100
So this is a really vile smell.

00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:03.010
I have smelled US government
standard bathroom malodor,

00:14:03.010 --> 00:14:04.050
and it is pretty bad.

00:14:09.850 --> 00:14:11.362
So that was where they started.

00:14:11.362 --> 00:14:12.570
And then they're very clever.

00:14:12.570 --> 00:14:16.270
At Monell they really
know their smells.

00:14:16.270 --> 00:14:23.010
What they did for this
nonlethal weapon is they

00:14:23.010 --> 00:14:29.590
added a kind of floral,
fruity, sweet top note to it.

00:14:29.590 --> 00:14:32.240
Because when you're presented
with an unknown smell,

00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:34.660
you take a tentative
little whiff.

00:14:34.660 --> 00:14:37.060
And if that top node
is nice, then you

00:14:37.060 --> 00:14:40.000
do what's called
the keeper inhale.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.900
So people go oh, this is nice.

00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:45.460
And then they'd get this,
this like wall of smell.

00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:47.650
And it tends to stay.

00:14:47.650 --> 00:14:51.100
Something about it-- Pam
Dalton is the chemist.

00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:53.420
She was like, it keeps
rebinding to the receptors

00:14:53.420 --> 00:14:55.760
and you get it
stuck in your nose.

00:14:55.760 --> 00:15:00.190
And I have, in my closet,
a sample of stench soup

00:15:00.190 --> 00:15:03.340
that is in a bottle,
sealed, with paraffin,

00:15:03.340 --> 00:15:05.280
double bagged in a box.

00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:07.590
And I haven't had the
courage to open it.

00:15:07.590 --> 00:15:09.900
It's kind of like
this mystery box

00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:11.860
that's just sat there
for over a year.

00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:13.010
And I don't really
know-- I thought maybe

00:15:13.010 --> 00:15:15.301
I would bring it to the
Republican National Convention.

00:15:18.420 --> 00:15:20.170
I don't know What I'm
going to do with it.

00:15:20.170 --> 00:15:21.954
But I will open it somewhere.

00:15:21.954 --> 00:15:23.620
I thought maybe, oh
I'll bring it along.

00:15:23.620 --> 00:15:24.744
I could bring it to Google.

00:15:24.744 --> 00:15:29.770
And then I thought, it could
get into the ventilation

00:15:29.770 --> 00:15:32.060
and you guys could be
on the street for days.

00:15:32.060 --> 00:15:36.850
So I have to be a little bit
careful with my stench soup.

00:15:36.850 --> 00:15:40.380
So anyway, that's stench soup.

00:15:40.380 --> 00:15:43.790
But for the most part,
some of the humor

00:15:43.790 --> 00:15:46.170
is kind of the
historical elements.

00:15:46.170 --> 00:15:49.590
And the other thing is
just I'm such an outsider

00:15:49.590 --> 00:15:52.180
to the military
culture, and it really

00:15:52.180 --> 00:15:54.260
is a culture, a foreign culture.

00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:57.090
And I've not spent
any time in it.

00:15:57.090 --> 00:15:58.380
My family is not military.

00:15:58.380 --> 00:16:03.000
My dad was 65 when I was
born, so he enlisted.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:04.990
He came over on the "Lusitania."

00:16:04.990 --> 00:16:08.520
In World War I he
enlisted in the military.

00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:11.530
Born in England, he
was-- I found his papers

00:16:11.530 --> 00:16:12.960
at Fort Moultrie.

00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:16.500
But my dad got a hernia
in basic training.

00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:20.350
That's the illustrious
Roach military saga.

00:16:20.350 --> 00:16:27.389
So it's not a personal
history by any means.

00:16:27.389 --> 00:16:29.430
And I don't know a lot of
people in the military,

00:16:29.430 --> 00:16:32.640
so it's fascinating to me
to be kind of in this world,

00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:34.860
sort of thrashing around.

00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:37.050
And I would find
myself-- I mean,

00:16:37.050 --> 00:16:42.400
sometimes the humor came just
from that, that kind of I'm

00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:44.830
really out of my element here.

00:16:44.830 --> 00:16:52.580
I was in Djibouti, which
is a North African nation

00:16:52.580 --> 00:16:54.590
above Somalia,
across from Yemen,

00:16:54.590 --> 00:16:57.280
which obviously gives you a
sense of what goes on there.

00:16:57.280 --> 00:17:00.700
A lot of counterinsurgency,
special operations stuff

00:17:00.700 --> 00:17:01.760
goes on there.

00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:02.700
And I was on the base.

00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:06.609
The special operations, those
folks are in a restricted zone

00:17:06.609 --> 00:17:09.270
that you need
clearance to go into.

00:17:09.270 --> 00:17:11.400
So I went over there
with Captain Mark Riddle,

00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:13.640
who is a diarrhea researcher.

00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:17.930
He's an MD and he was testing
a much faster, one dose

00:17:17.930 --> 00:17:22.119
regimen for diarrhea,
traveler's diarrhea,

00:17:22.119 --> 00:17:26.170
a particular kind of E.
coli that's fairly common

00:17:26.170 --> 00:17:28.160
and is pretty nasty.

00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:31.080
He was over there testing that.

00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:33.830
And the rates of diarrhea just
among the average deployed

00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:41.060
soldier in 2003 to '04, 77% of
soldiers and personnel had come

00:17:41.060 --> 00:17:45.790
down with diarrhea, 40% bad
enough that they sought medical

00:17:45.790 --> 00:17:50.260
care, and 32% had it bad enough
that there was a time when they

00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:52.540
didn't make it to
a bathroom in time.

00:17:52.540 --> 00:17:55.580
And if you can imagine a
special operations mission,

00:17:55.580 --> 00:17:57.940
these are fairly
critical, high risk,

00:17:57.940 --> 00:18:00.550
kind of take out Osama
bin Laden style things.

00:18:00.550 --> 00:18:04.500
And if you are hit with
this sudden extreme urgency,

00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:06.490
you can't just go, could
someone else cover me,

00:18:06.490 --> 00:18:08.630
because I've got [MOANS],
not feeling well.

00:18:08.630 --> 00:18:12.160
So it's kind of a matter
of national security.

00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:13.490
And that was my take on it.

00:18:13.490 --> 00:18:15.390
So I thought OK, I need
to just talk to some

00:18:15.390 --> 00:18:17.649
of the special operations guys.

00:18:17.649 --> 00:18:19.190
They're easy to pick
out because they

00:18:19.190 --> 00:18:21.070
have beards and no one
else there-- everyone

00:18:21.070 --> 00:18:22.010
else is clean shaven.

00:18:22.010 --> 00:18:24.800
They need to fit in with
the local population

00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:27.230
in these villages.

00:18:27.230 --> 00:18:29.740
And they the public
affairs guy is like Mary,

00:18:29.740 --> 00:18:33.220
I sent out an email for you, and
I've already humiliated myself.

00:18:33.220 --> 00:18:35.170
So it became known as
the diarrhea email.

00:18:35.170 --> 00:18:38.060
Will somebody please share
their stories of diarrhea

00:18:38.060 --> 00:18:40.560
with our visiting writer.

00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:42.500
And nobody-- well, some
people did, but no one

00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:44.550
from special operations.

00:18:44.550 --> 00:18:45.760
Oh, I will.

00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:52.270
So he said, you
know, Captain Riddle

00:18:52.270 --> 00:18:55.770
said, "You're going to have
to talk to them over dinner.

00:18:55.770 --> 00:18:57.670
They only come out to eat."

00:18:57.670 --> 00:19:00.100
And Seamus, the
public affairs guys

00:19:00.100 --> 00:19:05.410
goes, "And to steal our women."

00:19:05.410 --> 00:19:07.860
Anyway, so my only
opportunity to talk

00:19:07.860 --> 00:19:12.340
to these individuals, who are a
little intimidating to someone

00:19:12.340 --> 00:19:15.180
like me, was in the
dining facility.

00:19:15.180 --> 00:19:21.120
So it created this kind of
wonderfully awkward scenario

00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:23.240
of crossing the room to
approach this very sort

00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:26.160
of stony and omnipotent
seeming person eating

00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:28.930
by himself, who just kind
of looked up at us and said,

00:19:28.930 --> 00:19:30.050
I'm done.

00:19:30.050 --> 00:19:32.630
And Seamus said oh, could I
ask just what line of work

00:19:32.630 --> 00:19:33.190
are you in.

00:19:33.190 --> 00:19:34.640
And he said I'm leaving.

00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:35.530
And he got up to go.

00:19:35.530 --> 00:19:37.470
And I had to jump
in and sort of just

00:19:37.470 --> 00:19:39.000
say, "My name is Mary Roach.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:40.010
I'm working on a book.

00:19:40.010 --> 00:19:43.090
And I wanted to talk
to you about diarrhea.

00:19:43.090 --> 00:19:44.920
I know that it sounds
like a silly topic."

00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:49.960
And he looked up
and said, "It's not.

00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:51.470
You're welcome to sit down."

00:19:51.470 --> 00:19:56.960
So it was a very interesting
conversation and a very unusual

00:19:56.960 --> 00:19:57.980
reporting challenge.

00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:09.550
Anyway, the thing
about the book is

00:20:09.550 --> 00:20:13.880
one of the reasons I went
ahead with this book is

00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:16.960
because the topics are
things that anybody

00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:19.600
in the military deals with
a really extreme version of,

00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:23.520
whether it's overheating or
back pain from heavy loads

00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:29.200
or sleep deprivation or
hearing loss from loud noise.

00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:30.960
The science of
these topics would

00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:36.760
be applicable to anybody who
has a body and ears and a back.

00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:43.150
The culture of the
military is interesting,

00:20:43.150 --> 00:20:45.130
but also just the
science of-- you know,

00:20:45.130 --> 00:20:50.590
the science of sweat
and heat stroke--

00:20:50.590 --> 00:20:57.160
I mean, it's a big problem
because the situation that

00:20:57.160 --> 00:21:00.860
creates heat stroke is this
competition for bodily fluid,

00:21:00.860 --> 00:21:02.130
specifically blood.

00:21:02.130 --> 00:21:04.120
Because your sweat is plasma.

00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:06.250
It's the clear
portion of your blood.

00:21:06.250 --> 00:21:08.080
And when you start to
overheat-- your body

00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:10.790
is a machine that wants to be
in a set temperature range.

00:21:10.790 --> 00:21:12.530
And if you stray
from that, it does

00:21:12.530 --> 00:21:13.740
what it can to bring it back.

00:21:13.740 --> 00:21:16.980
And the first thing it
does is generate sweat.

00:21:16.980 --> 00:21:20.610
So all the blood is
shunted to your skin,

00:21:20.610 --> 00:21:23.840
and the plasma comes out
through the sweat glands,

00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:26.030
and then kind of
vaporizes and takes away

00:21:26.030 --> 00:21:27.382
the heat from your body.

00:21:27.382 --> 00:21:28.090
And that's great.

00:21:28.090 --> 00:21:29.910
And it's very, very efficient.

00:21:29.910 --> 00:21:32.100
However if you are
exerting yourself,

00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:35.170
if you're carrying a heavy
pack and you're running,

00:21:35.170 --> 00:21:37.400
especially if you haven't
hydrated yourself well,

00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:41.900
you have this competition for
a limited amount of resources.

00:21:41.900 --> 00:21:44.880
And at a certain point, somes
got to go to the muscles,

00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:47.160
and it's got to go to
the blood to cool you.

00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:50.690
And your body will start
to shut down other things.

00:21:50.690 --> 00:21:52.660
You might not get enough
blood to your head.

00:21:52.660 --> 00:21:57.240
That's why people pass out
when they're very, very hot.

00:21:57.240 --> 00:22:00.130
Or your gut can
start to shut down.

00:22:00.130 --> 00:22:03.130
And that leads to a sort
of a chain of events

00:22:03.130 --> 00:22:09.860
that can result in delirium,
coma, and then you're dead.

00:22:09.860 --> 00:22:14.310
The military was trying
the-- medical school,

00:22:14.310 --> 00:22:17.330
USU, Uniformed Services
University of Health Sciences

00:22:17.330 --> 00:22:20.600
was working on trying
to figure out--

00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:22.910
because there's a lot of
individual difference in how

00:22:22.910 --> 00:22:26.640
well you acclimate to heat and
how badly you suffer from it.

00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:30.640
So the idea was, well,
could we find a blood marker

00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:33.710
or is there some sort of genetic
difference between people?

00:22:33.710 --> 00:22:37.110
Can we identify who
is really at risk

00:22:37.110 --> 00:22:40.020
and keep them out
of this scenario?

00:22:40.020 --> 00:22:43.939
Which is a great plan,
and it was interesting

00:22:43.939 --> 00:22:45.480
because they have
the cook box there,

00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:48.020
which is a box that they can
adjust the heat and humidity

00:22:48.020 --> 00:22:51.400
and sort of create a really
god awful hot day in the Middle

00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:54.850
East with a treadmill
and a backpack.

00:22:54.850 --> 00:22:59.770
I lasted seven minutes out
of the hour and a half.

00:22:59.770 --> 00:23:00.990
It's pretty brutal.

00:23:00.990 --> 00:23:02.900
And my pack only
had 30 pounds, which

00:23:02.900 --> 00:23:05.490
is about what the body
armor itself would weigh.

00:23:05.490 --> 00:23:09.850
So it's unbelievable how
fit, how these people are,

00:23:09.850 --> 00:23:12.350
and what they endure.

00:23:15.139 --> 00:23:17.180
Something that seems like
would be a good answer,

00:23:17.180 --> 00:23:22.620
it's a little tough
because what happens,

00:23:22.620 --> 00:23:25.290
you take people out of--
it's like OK, this guy,

00:23:25.290 --> 00:23:27.170
obviously, we've
been able to identify

00:23:27.170 --> 00:23:30.300
these people are not going
to fare well in extreme heat.

00:23:30.300 --> 00:23:31.320
So let's hold them back.

00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:34.050
And then so the people who
are fit end up doing more

00:23:34.050 --> 00:23:35.019
than their fair share.

00:23:35.019 --> 00:23:36.560
They're the only
ones you can call in

00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:38.040
to do a really hard job.

00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:40.370
And so they push themselves
and then collapse.

00:23:40.370 --> 00:23:45.110
So it's just really hard.

00:23:45.110 --> 00:23:48.650
There's an environmental
medicine unit at Natick labs

00:23:48.650 --> 00:23:50.190
that has a mannequin
that sweats,

00:23:50.190 --> 00:23:52.540
that they figure out
these sweat prediction

00:23:52.540 --> 00:23:57.230
equations where give me how
many miles, how hot is it,

00:23:57.230 --> 00:24:00.690
how much are they carrying,
what's the body armor.

00:24:00.690 --> 00:24:02.610
And then you plug it
all into a formula

00:24:02.610 --> 00:24:05.110
and it tells you this is how
much water per person to carry.

00:24:05.110 --> 00:24:08.095
So they're trying to get it
dialed down to a science.

00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:16.560
But ultimately, when you
get into the real world

00:24:16.560 --> 00:24:18.640
of a mission, there's
always five or six things

00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:20.950
nobody counted on.

00:24:20.950 --> 00:24:23.416
It's just really
hard to hand someone

00:24:23.416 --> 00:24:25.540
a formula that's going to
solve all their problems.

00:24:25.540 --> 00:24:29.800
And the soldiers are
like, these scientists,

00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:31.360
these rules that
these guys in air

00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:32.980
conditioned offices
come up with.

00:24:32.980 --> 00:24:35.220
So there's kind of a
tension between the soldiers

00:24:35.220 --> 00:24:37.060
and the scientists.

00:24:37.060 --> 00:24:38.772
But they're all trying
to do their job.

00:24:43.550 --> 00:24:46.570
And the one thing I
wanted to do for the book,

00:24:46.570 --> 00:24:50.670
I initially had
planned to embed.

00:24:50.670 --> 00:24:55.820
This was when there was still
stuff going on in Afghanistan.

00:24:55.820 --> 00:24:56.910
And I was going to embed.

00:24:56.910 --> 00:25:02.720
I initially had an idea I wanted
to embedded with the 4th Marine

00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:07.080
Corps Dental Battalion, just
because that whole concept

00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:10.090
of a Marine Corps
Dental Battalion

00:25:10.090 --> 00:25:11.860
just really appealed to me.

00:25:11.860 --> 00:25:15.000
As I said, I had a notion
of these guys parachuting

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:16.925
in with little picks, smocks.

00:25:19.460 --> 00:25:21.360
Of course that's not the case.

00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:24.000
And they're like yeah, well
we're not going anywhere.

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:25.270
Thanks for your interest.

00:25:25.270 --> 00:25:28.220
So the Marine Corps Dental
Battalion was off the list,

00:25:28.220 --> 00:25:28.790
sadly.

00:25:28.790 --> 00:25:32.290
But I still like to talk about
the 4th Marine Corps Dental

00:25:32.290 --> 00:25:36.630
Battalion just because there's
a dental battalion, a Marine

00:25:36.630 --> 00:25:38.260
Corps Dental Battalion.

00:25:38.260 --> 00:25:40.570
Similarly at one
point I thought it

00:25:40.570 --> 00:25:42.310
would be-- because
my editor of course

00:25:42.310 --> 00:25:44.740
was like, special
operations, can you

00:25:44.740 --> 00:25:46.940
go out with a special
operations team?

00:25:46.940 --> 00:25:51.610
I'm like, I kind of think that's
classified stuff, but I'll try.

00:25:51.610 --> 00:25:54.280
So I called the Special
Operations Command Public

00:25:54.280 --> 00:25:55.890
Affairs Office.

00:25:55.890 --> 00:25:58.460
And I thought OK,
I'll cover-- what

00:25:58.460 --> 00:26:01.000
about, because they have
their own weather command,

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:02.110
their own weather people.

00:26:02.110 --> 00:26:05.710
Because if you're
flying in somewhere,

00:26:05.710 --> 00:26:07.240
weather is important.

00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:09.970
And it's a critical element.

00:26:09.970 --> 00:26:15.320
But I could just imagine, it's
a just a very elite group.

00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:17.310
And if you made it into
special operations,

00:26:17.310 --> 00:26:19.110
and then you got
to brag about that.

00:26:19.110 --> 00:26:23.400
I got into special
operations-- special operations

00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:26.880
weather command.

00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:28.942
So I thought that
would be interesting,

00:26:28.942 --> 00:26:30.900
that these folks would
have an interesting take

00:26:30.900 --> 00:26:31.691
on the whole thing.

00:26:31.691 --> 00:26:33.940
And I explained that to
the public affairs guy.

00:26:33.940 --> 00:26:38.120
And he said yeah, that's
just not going to happen.

00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:39.560
It's classified.

00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:43.160
And I actually said to
him, "But I'm only going

00:26:43.160 --> 00:26:45.040
to ask questions about weather.

00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:48.360
So I won't pay any
attention to anybody else,

00:26:48.360 --> 00:26:50.036
what they're doing."

00:26:50.036 --> 00:26:53.220
No-- no.

00:26:53.220 --> 00:26:57.250
So there were some walls that
were thrown up, understandably,

00:26:57.250 --> 00:26:59.030
in my efforts to
report this book.

00:26:59.030 --> 00:27:06.000
But I made my way onto a
ballistic missile submarine,

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:10.240
the "USS Tennessee," which
was a fascinating place to be.

00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:13.530
They had been a serious
issue with sleep deprivation.

00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:18.200
Most of the guys at that
time had been averaging

00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:19.670
around four hours sleep.

00:27:19.670 --> 00:27:23.280
It's kind of not what
you want on a vessel that

00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:27.880
is powered by a nuclear reactor
and carries 20 some Trident

00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:28.700
missiles.

00:27:28.700 --> 00:27:30.450
So they were trying
out a different watch,

00:27:30.450 --> 00:27:35.360
because a submarine is isolated
from the normal queues of day

00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:36.059
and night.

00:27:36.059 --> 00:27:38.600
The thought was, well maybe we
can muck with circadian rhythm

00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:40.830
and create a different
length of day,

00:27:40.830 --> 00:27:42.660
thereby making things
more productive.

00:27:42.660 --> 00:27:44.887
But in fact you had
a situation where

00:27:44.887 --> 00:27:46.970
they might have been a
little less sleep deprived,

00:27:46.970 --> 00:27:49.610
but it was like flying
to Paris every day

00:27:49.610 --> 00:27:51.450
is how someone put it.

00:27:51.450 --> 00:27:53.240
That circadian
rhythm was just off.

00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:56.640
Their body rhythm was
off with the clock.

00:27:56.640 --> 00:27:59.990
So they were trying
something, moving it back

00:27:59.990 --> 00:28:03.070
onto a circadian
friendly time schedule.

00:28:03.070 --> 00:28:07.220
So that's what was going
on the "USS Tennessee."

00:28:07.220 --> 00:28:09.670
It took me a year and
a half to get on there.

00:28:09.670 --> 00:28:13.720
Not because anybody
was saying no, just

00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:17.620
because its very
hard to find somebody

00:28:17.620 --> 00:28:19.440
who had the
authority to say yes.

00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:22.340
So you get a lot of,
well it seems OK to me,

00:28:22.340 --> 00:28:23.840
but I'm not the one
who can say yes.

00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:26.570
So you kind of get
bounced around.

00:28:26.570 --> 00:28:30.771
The Djibouti trip, I think there
were probably 60 or so emails

00:28:30.771 --> 00:28:32.520
flying around over the
span of three weeks

00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:35.570
to just try to go with
the diarrhea research

00:28:35.570 --> 00:28:36.910
to Camp Lemonnier.

00:28:36.910 --> 00:28:41.240
And the Navy public
affairs person was like,

00:28:41.240 --> 00:28:42.300
seems fine to me.

00:28:42.300 --> 00:28:44.480
I don't even know,
is it CENTCOM?

00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:45.490
Is it AFRICOM?

00:28:45.490 --> 00:28:46.820
Is it Joint Horn of Africa?

00:28:46.820 --> 00:28:47.640
Is it the Pentagon?

00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:49.060
I have no idea who to ask.

00:28:49.060 --> 00:28:51.160
I don't know who can
sign off on this.

00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:55.620
And finally it came down to
that guy Seamus on the ground

00:28:55.620 --> 00:28:58.160
in Camp Lemonnier who had
seen all these emails pinging

00:28:58.160 --> 00:29:01.669
around, and finally said--
because I asked him,

00:29:01.669 --> 00:29:02.960
"How did you make this happen?"

00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:04.751
He said, "Well you
know, at a certain point

00:29:04.751 --> 00:29:06.830
I thought, this is
not like diarrhea.

00:29:06.830 --> 00:29:09.267
You can't just hydrate and
wait for it to go away.

00:29:11.672 --> 00:29:12.880
Somebody has to do something.

00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:15.060
So I went into the base
commander's office and I said,

00:29:15.060 --> 00:29:17.630
'Do you care if this woman comes
here to talk about diarrhea

00:29:17.630 --> 00:29:20.830
with people?' And he's like, 'I
don't care.'" So they said yes,

00:29:20.830 --> 00:29:21.380
that's fine.

00:29:21.380 --> 00:29:26.150
So weeks of formally petitioning
the wrong person over and over

00:29:26.150 --> 00:29:26.930
and over.

00:29:26.930 --> 00:29:30.090
And in the end it was just
the guy on the ground.

00:29:30.090 --> 00:29:32.110
Sorry, I have a
little bit of a lost--

00:29:32.110 --> 00:29:36.100
I've been talking a lot lately.

00:29:36.100 --> 00:29:40.710
So I should probably sort of
wind it down and take questions

00:29:40.710 --> 00:29:42.349
from anybody who has questions.

00:29:42.349 --> 00:29:43.890
Or if you wanted me
to talk about any

00:29:43.890 --> 00:29:48.732
of the other
subjects in the book,

00:29:48.732 --> 00:29:52.380
I talked also about
genital injuries,

00:29:52.380 --> 00:29:55.152
which is something we've been
seeing lately for two reasons.

00:29:55.152 --> 00:29:57.110
There's been that the
bombs have gotten bigger,

00:29:57.110 --> 00:30:01.540
and also the emergency medical
care and medical evacuations

00:30:01.540 --> 00:30:04.890
have gotten better and
faster, so bigger injuries

00:30:04.890 --> 00:30:06.307
and more people surviving them.

00:30:06.307 --> 00:30:08.140
It used to be if there
was a bomb big enough

00:30:08.140 --> 00:30:11.400
to damage the pelvic region
rather than just blow off

00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:12.916
your foot, you didn't survive.

00:30:12.916 --> 00:30:14.290
And now these guys
are surviving.

00:30:14.290 --> 00:30:19.310
So there's interesting
reconstructive work,

00:30:19.310 --> 00:30:23.100
some of it coming
out of cooperation

00:30:23.100 --> 00:30:26.150
with the transgendered
community, which build penises

00:30:26.150 --> 00:30:27.130
all the time.

00:30:27.130 --> 00:30:30.300
What do you need to know?

00:30:30.300 --> 00:30:35.440
Anyway, so there's that and
lots of other fun topics.

00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:40.810
But I'd be happy to talk about
any questions people have

00:30:40.810 --> 00:30:43.310
or about any of my other books.

00:30:45.597 --> 00:30:47.180
AUDIENCE: So you do
a lot of research.

00:30:47.180 --> 00:30:49.220
How much actually
makes it into the book

00:30:49.220 --> 00:30:52.320
and how many of these gems
are just left on the floor?

00:30:52.320 --> 00:30:55.790
MARY ROACH: Oh well, I
write everything down.

00:30:55.790 --> 00:30:57.820
Because when I go
somewhere, I don't really

00:30:57.820 --> 00:31:01.179
know what the chapter is
about quite, because I

00:31:01.179 --> 00:31:02.220
haven't met these people.

00:31:02.220 --> 00:31:04.011
I don't really know
what's going to happen.

00:31:04.011 --> 00:31:05.580
So I'm just writing
everything down.

00:31:05.580 --> 00:31:10.820
I would say 0.01% of what I
write down I actually use.

00:31:10.820 --> 00:31:11.720
It's insane.

00:31:11.720 --> 00:31:14.770
It's so much just
stuff that-- And I'll

00:31:14.770 --> 00:31:18.290
go back and look at a notebook,
I have no idea what I was even

00:31:18.290 --> 00:31:19.540
writing down.

00:31:19.540 --> 00:31:21.730
So no gems.

00:31:21.730 --> 00:31:22.610
The gems, no.

00:31:22.610 --> 00:31:23.640
The gems go in the book.

00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:31.382
In fact when I go on a reporting
trip, I go back to my room

00:31:31.382 --> 00:31:32.590
and I go through my notebook.

00:31:32.590 --> 00:31:34.260
And I have a system
where if it looks

00:31:34.260 --> 00:31:38.349
like a promising something
somebody said or something

00:31:38.349 --> 00:31:39.890
that was interesting,
I'll circle it.

00:31:39.890 --> 00:31:42.110
And if it's really good, I'll
circle it and put three stars.

00:31:42.110 --> 00:31:43.526
And I go one, two,
or three stars.

00:31:43.526 --> 00:31:44.760
So I have this rating system.

00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:47.530
And I pull that stuff
out into a transcript.

00:31:47.530 --> 00:31:49.510
And then I print that out.

00:31:49.510 --> 00:31:51.730
And then I go through and
circle stuff in there.

00:31:51.730 --> 00:31:54.420
And I move the really good
stuff to the top, kind of just

00:31:54.420 --> 00:31:56.850
like this is the good shit.

00:31:56.850 --> 00:31:58.360
This is going to go in somehow.

00:31:58.360 --> 00:32:01.720
And that actually influences
how I shape the chapter.

00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:05.840
Like if there's a scene
that is really great,

00:32:05.840 --> 00:32:08.190
that seems like it would
be really fun to read,

00:32:08.190 --> 00:32:11.070
I'll figure out, now what's
the order of these two or three

00:32:11.070 --> 00:32:11.570
scenes.

00:32:11.570 --> 00:32:14.190
So I identify the
scenes and quotes.

00:32:14.190 --> 00:32:16.070
But most of it, yeah.

00:32:16.070 --> 00:32:17.475
Most of it just--

00:32:17.475 --> 00:32:19.350
And when I was on the
submarine at one point,

00:32:19.350 --> 00:32:22.020
I was interviewing
someone and something

00:32:22.020 --> 00:32:24.850
was said over the intercom
that was classified.

00:32:24.850 --> 00:32:27.030
And the ship's
commanding officer

00:32:27.030 --> 00:32:29.680
said, "I'm really sorry, you'd
going to have to delete that."

00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:31.520
And I said, "It's an MP3 file.

00:32:31.520 --> 00:32:32.300
I can't go in.

00:32:32.300 --> 00:32:33.850
I mean, you guys probably could.

00:32:33.850 --> 00:32:37.070
You can't go in and
just delete a word."

00:32:37.070 --> 00:32:39.335
And he said, "Well,
you're either

00:32:39.335 --> 00:32:41.410
going to have to
delete the whole file,

00:32:41.410 --> 00:32:43.260
or I guess I could
transcribe it."

00:32:43.260 --> 00:32:44.010
I'm like, yeah.

00:32:47.090 --> 00:32:49.320
So this guy is so busy.

00:32:49.320 --> 00:32:51.189
He's got so much on his plate.

00:32:51.189 --> 00:32:53.480
And this annoying journalist
who's there for four days,

00:32:53.480 --> 00:32:57.160
out at sea, I kept going
by his little state room.

00:32:57.160 --> 00:33:00.890
He's hunched over his computer.

00:33:00.890 --> 00:33:03.520
And it was the most beautifully
transcribed, every word

00:33:03.520 --> 00:33:05.710
written out, spelled perfectly.

00:33:05.710 --> 00:33:08.270
You know, Mary Roach, colon.

00:33:08.270 --> 00:33:10.380
It was like a screenplay.

00:33:10.380 --> 00:33:12.950
Whereas when I type it, you
could barely figure it out.

00:33:12.950 --> 00:33:15.500
I abbreviate every word.

00:33:15.500 --> 00:33:18.745
Anyway, so that's kind of
my haphazard procedure.

00:33:21.420 --> 00:33:21.960
Yeah?

00:33:21.960 --> 00:33:22.501
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:33:22.501 --> 00:33:26.450
I was very interested to hear--
you talk about the autopsies

00:33:26.450 --> 00:33:28.110
at the beginning
of your remarks,

00:33:28.110 --> 00:33:30.650
particularly in the nonmilitary
world, a lot of doctors

00:33:30.650 --> 00:33:32.900
are concerned that they're
not doing enough autopsies.

00:33:32.900 --> 00:33:34.860
They're not learning
enough from their mistakes

00:33:34.860 --> 00:33:35.820
or their problems.

00:33:35.820 --> 00:33:38.630
Do you know anything about how
the information might flow?

00:33:38.630 --> 00:33:41.370
Do the military doctors write
papers or data summaries

00:33:41.370 --> 00:33:43.322
from what they learn
in their autopsy work?

00:33:43.322 --> 00:33:45.030
MARY ROACH: I think
they do write papers.

00:33:45.030 --> 00:33:48.490
They do that conference just
to get the information back

00:33:48.490 --> 00:33:52.030
to the medics and the
emergency room people.

00:33:52.030 --> 00:33:55.100
But I think they do go on and
write papers based on what

00:33:55.100 --> 00:33:56.910
they're learning from autopsy.

00:33:56.910 --> 00:33:58.990
Autopsies, like
hospital autopsies,

00:33:58.990 --> 00:34:01.710
that's an interesting realm.

00:34:01.710 --> 00:34:07.180
I know the medical examiner in
the Bay Area-- of course I do.

00:34:07.180 --> 00:34:08.110
We go have lunch.

00:34:08.110 --> 00:34:09.380
She's like "Oh,
I've a decomp today.

00:34:09.380 --> 00:34:10.338
You want to come over?"

00:34:10.338 --> 00:34:14.730
I'm like "Hey, not so
much before lunch, no."

00:34:14.730 --> 00:34:19.370
She said that there
is sometimes--

00:34:19.370 --> 00:34:20.920
she didn't give
me any specifics,

00:34:20.920 --> 00:34:25.350
but there might be pressure
on the medical examiner

00:34:25.350 --> 00:34:28.480
not to find negligence.

00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:30.980
That was upsetting to me,
like that the whole idea

00:34:30.980 --> 00:34:34.980
with an autopsy is to get at
the truth of what happened.

00:34:34.980 --> 00:34:37.380
Probably that's not
a regular occurrence,

00:34:37.380 --> 00:34:39.159
but that was sort
of disconcerting.

00:34:39.159 --> 00:34:45.460
So I think there's some politics
behind prevalence of autopsy.

00:34:45.460 --> 00:34:50.409
It tends to be done when
the cause isn't obvious,

00:34:50.409 --> 00:34:53.020
when it seems suicide or
homicide is suspected.

00:34:53.020 --> 00:34:57.720
But people die in hospitals
and the family wants to know.

00:34:57.720 --> 00:35:01.460
You can get a private--
you can call 1-800-AUTOPSY

00:35:01.460 --> 00:35:04.470
and they drive up in a van.

00:35:04.470 --> 00:35:06.990
You can contract someone
to do an autopsy.

00:35:06.990 --> 00:35:09.610
So that would be an
interesting realm to explore.

00:35:09.610 --> 00:35:12.310
I don't know that much about
it or whether I have even

00:35:12.310 --> 00:35:14.740
answered your question.

00:35:14.740 --> 00:35:17.236
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:35:17.236 --> 00:35:17.860
MARY ROACH: Hi.

00:35:17.860 --> 00:35:20.224
AUDIENCE: I am a huge
fan of your books there--

00:35:20.224 --> 00:35:21.140
MARY ROACH: Oh thanks.

00:35:21.140 --> 00:35:23.955
AUDIENCE: --highly entertaining
and very educational.

00:35:23.955 --> 00:35:25.820
And I have not read
"Grunt" yet, though I'm

00:35:25.820 --> 00:35:26.360
very excited to do so.

00:35:26.360 --> 00:35:28.290
And a lot of the things
you've spoken about

00:35:28.290 --> 00:35:31.800
are the physical--
the smell, the bodies.

00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:35.560
Do you touch or have you touched
on the mental side of things

00:35:35.560 --> 00:35:38.640
and technology and
innovation in that space?

00:35:38.640 --> 00:35:43.460
MARY ROACH: I was going to after
the 4th Marine Corps Dental

00:35:43.460 --> 00:35:46.000
Battalion turned me down.

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:50.110
I had planned and got permission
to embed with the Chaplain

00:35:50.110 --> 00:35:54.870
Corps, because I wanted
to cover PTSD-- or not

00:35:54.870 --> 00:35:56.920
PTSD, but just specifically
emotional issues

00:35:56.920 --> 00:36:01.360
and how a variety of them, like
dealing with a death in a unit

00:36:01.360 --> 00:36:03.330
or whatever comes up.

00:36:03.330 --> 00:36:06.720
And the chaplain, the chaplain's
assistant who has a weapon

00:36:06.720 --> 00:36:08.180
and covers for
the chaplain, they

00:36:08.180 --> 00:36:11.910
go out on missions with a unit.

00:36:11.910 --> 00:36:14.550
Which I hadn't
realized, I thought

00:36:14.550 --> 00:36:17.555
they stayed back on base and
had an office that people

00:36:17.555 --> 00:36:18.180
would come too.

00:36:18.180 --> 00:36:20.180
But they'll actually go
out on a route clearance

00:36:20.180 --> 00:36:23.450
mission or whatever it is so
they can offer this empathy.

00:36:23.450 --> 00:36:25.630
I wasn't interested in
the religious element

00:36:25.630 --> 00:36:28.990
so much as their
ability to empathize

00:36:28.990 --> 00:36:31.370
because they've kind of been
through similar hardships.

00:36:31.370 --> 00:36:32.370
And that fascinated me.

00:36:32.370 --> 00:36:34.000
And I was really disappointed.

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:35.740
I was approved by
the US, but then

00:36:35.740 --> 00:36:39.160
ISAF, which is the coalition
umbrella organization,

00:36:39.160 --> 00:36:40.900
said no because
it's the drawdown

00:36:40.900 --> 00:36:45.010
and we have hardly
any journalists.

00:36:45.010 --> 00:36:48.350
And I think it was more
like hey, you didn't ask us.

00:36:48.350 --> 00:36:49.300
Who says you could go?

00:36:49.300 --> 00:36:51.380
Somehow he saw an
email and was like hey,

00:36:51.380 --> 00:36:52.520
you didn't talk to me.

00:36:52.520 --> 00:36:53.530
I don't know.

00:36:53.530 --> 00:36:55.180
Do you know what
they say ISAF stands

00:36:55.180 --> 00:36:57.860
for-- I suck at fighting.

00:37:00.600 --> 00:37:02.886
That's my little dig at
ISAF for turning me down.

00:37:02.886 --> 00:37:04.760
No, I don't even know
ISAF, international-- I

00:37:04.760 --> 00:37:08.620
don't even know-- what
does ISAF even stand for?

00:37:08.620 --> 00:37:11.919
International-- it's
those guys, the overseers.

00:37:11.919 --> 00:37:12.710
It's the coalition.

00:37:12.710 --> 00:37:18.952
But anyway, because I didn't
really have a narrative--

00:37:18.952 --> 00:37:22.470
I didn't find another way in
that would afford kind of-- I

00:37:22.470 --> 00:37:26.756
like to have sort of a
scene and a setting thing.

00:37:26.756 --> 00:37:28.630
I think I had a chapter
in "Packing for Mars"

00:37:28.630 --> 00:37:32.940
that had to do with sort of
unique psychological components

00:37:32.940 --> 00:37:34.170
of being in space.

00:37:34.170 --> 00:37:37.170
And I had planned to do
that but didn't end up.

00:37:37.170 --> 00:37:39.460
And there's a lot
of coverage of that

00:37:39.460 --> 00:37:41.150
as well that other
people I think

00:37:41.150 --> 00:37:43.147
have done a nice job with.

00:37:43.147 --> 00:37:43.980
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:37:43.980 --> 00:37:45.230
Looking forward to reading it.

00:37:45.230 --> 00:37:46.914
MARY ROACH: Thank you.

00:37:46.914 --> 00:37:48.670
Hi.

00:37:48.670 --> 00:37:51.840
AUDIENCE: After spending so
much time in your research,

00:37:51.840 --> 00:37:54.450
did you find your
opinions related

00:37:54.450 --> 00:37:59.110
to the military, its command
structure, its politics,

00:37:59.110 --> 00:38:02.040
the soldiers, their
lifestyle or their worldview,

00:38:02.040 --> 00:38:05.330
did you find your opinions
changing on that at all?

00:38:05.330 --> 00:38:07.950
What was kind of the
before and after of that?

00:38:07.950 --> 00:38:09.560
MARY ROACH: Well the
before was that I

00:38:09.560 --> 00:38:15.160
had this view of the military
as a sort of monolithic entity.

00:38:15.160 --> 00:38:17.870
Which the more time you
spend in that realm,

00:38:17.870 --> 00:38:19.420
the more you see
how fractured it is.

00:38:19.420 --> 00:38:22.480
There's not just the different
branches of the military,

00:38:22.480 --> 00:38:26.640
but there's the policy
people in the Pentagon

00:38:26.640 --> 00:38:29.700
and then there's the scientists
and the medical people

00:38:29.700 --> 00:38:30.920
and the civilians who work.

00:38:30.920 --> 00:38:36.310
And so it became really hard
to have any single opinion.

00:38:36.310 --> 00:38:39.080
I ended up having a
tremendous amount of respect

00:38:39.080 --> 00:38:43.080
for the researchers
who do this work, which

00:38:43.080 --> 00:38:46.590
is going toward trying to
make this god awful experience

00:38:46.590 --> 00:38:50.270
somewhat more tolerable
and survivable.

00:38:50.270 --> 00:38:52.680
Those guys, those
people-- a lot of them

00:38:52.680 --> 00:38:55.280
were women actually in
the book-- were great.

00:38:55.280 --> 00:38:58.970
And so that's the main
world I inhabited.

00:38:58.970 --> 00:39:03.200
So I don't really have-- I
mean, my views on the larger

00:39:03.200 --> 00:39:07.460
entity of war and military
policy, et cetera,

00:39:07.460 --> 00:39:08.560
have not changed.

00:39:08.560 --> 00:39:10.312
But that did change.

00:39:10.312 --> 00:39:11.020
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:39:14.224 --> 00:39:15.640
AUDIENCE: I was
interested to hear

00:39:15.640 --> 00:39:19.740
you talking about the circadian
rhythm stuff on the submarines,

00:39:19.740 --> 00:39:22.460
especially because
since I read--

00:39:22.460 --> 00:39:25.190
I think "Bonk" and "Stiff" were
the first two books I read.

00:39:25.190 --> 00:39:26.690
I've been wondering
if you were ever

00:39:26.690 --> 00:39:29.090
going to do a book
specifically about sleep.

00:39:29.090 --> 00:39:32.540
MARY ROACH: Yeah, people have
suggested-- did I cut you off,

00:39:32.540 --> 00:39:33.520
or was that your--

00:39:33.520 --> 00:39:35.161
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
what do you think?

00:39:35.161 --> 00:39:36.910
MARY ROACH: Well, two
things are going on.

00:39:36.910 --> 00:39:39.060
My editor at WW
Norton just edited

00:39:39.060 --> 00:39:42.260
a book called
"Dreamland," I think,

00:39:42.260 --> 00:39:44.100
on sleep, the science of sleep.

00:39:44.100 --> 00:39:49.050
But more than that, because
it's dreaming and sleep,

00:39:49.050 --> 00:39:54.242
it's an internal state,
trying to imagine

00:39:54.242 --> 00:39:56.325
what would be the scene
and the setting-- it would

00:39:56.325 --> 00:40:00.790
be like chapter after chapter of
a guy on a bed with electrodes

00:40:00.790 --> 00:40:01.659
asleep.

00:40:01.659 --> 00:40:02.700
So it's kind of hard to--

00:40:02.700 --> 00:40:05.600
And you know how when you
tell your spouse or partner

00:40:05.600 --> 00:40:08.550
your dream, and they're like
instantly like, shut up,

00:40:08.550 --> 00:40:10.570
it's so boring.

00:40:10.570 --> 00:40:12.370
Please don't tell me your dream.

00:40:12.370 --> 00:40:14.770
So trying to describe--
I mean, not that it would

00:40:14.770 --> 00:40:17.320
be entirely about dreaming.

00:40:17.320 --> 00:40:19.010
But it felt a little
confining in terms

00:40:19.010 --> 00:40:23.900
of the color and the scenes
and kind of the narratives

00:40:23.900 --> 00:40:26.810
that would bring the research
to life, for that reason.

00:40:26.810 --> 00:40:29.985
But it is-- and I have
given it thought, yeah.

00:40:29.985 --> 00:40:32.342
AUDIENCE: Cool, thank you.

00:40:32.342 --> 00:40:33.800
AUDIENCE: Hi, thank
you for coming.

00:40:33.800 --> 00:40:36.250
My wife is very jealous that
she wasn't able to come.

00:40:36.250 --> 00:40:38.391
You're one of her
favorite authors.

00:40:38.391 --> 00:40:39.890
Have there been any
themes for books

00:40:39.890 --> 00:40:41.820
that you've started
pursuing and then abandoned

00:40:41.820 --> 00:40:43.778
because they didn't
actually bear enough fruit?

00:40:43.778 --> 00:40:45.640
And if so, what were they?

00:40:45.640 --> 00:40:49.700
MARY ROACH: Yeah, there was
one idea I had for a book

00:40:49.700 --> 00:40:51.760
that morphed into
"Packing for Mars."

00:40:51.760 --> 00:40:56.350
But originally this guy
I knew from way back

00:40:56.350 --> 00:40:58.710
when had gotten a
job in Galveston

00:40:58.710 --> 00:41:04.250
at the bed rest facility
connected to NASA where they're

00:41:04.250 --> 00:41:10.060
studying muscle wasting
and bone loss from being

00:41:10.060 --> 00:41:13.120
in weightlessness because
your body kind of just

00:41:13.120 --> 00:41:14.200
takes apart your muscles.

00:41:14.200 --> 00:41:16.366
We don't need these, we're
going to take them apart.

00:41:16.366 --> 00:41:19.350
So there's lot of bone
loss and muscle wasting.

00:41:19.350 --> 00:41:21.940
The analog for
that, the simulation

00:41:21.940 --> 00:41:24.820
is to have people lie in
bed slightly head down

00:41:24.820 --> 00:41:29.420
and not get up for three months.

00:41:29.420 --> 00:41:32.830
They're paid $17,000
or something.

00:41:32.830 --> 00:41:36.520
And I thought wow, the
whole human Guinea pig world

00:41:36.520 --> 00:41:40.130
seemed kind of
interesting and bizarre.

00:41:40.130 --> 00:41:41.894
But I talked to my agent.

00:41:41.894 --> 00:41:44.310
He's like, "It seems like it
would be a little repetitive.

00:41:44.310 --> 00:41:46.490
Is there enough variety?"

00:41:46.490 --> 00:41:49.310
I mean, a lot of people are
testing drugs, pharmaceuticals.

00:41:49.310 --> 00:41:51.290
That is an interesting
world, but that

00:41:51.290 --> 00:41:53.270
has been covered a fair amount.

00:41:53.270 --> 00:41:55.070
So again, it was
a situation where

00:41:55.070 --> 00:41:57.970
I didn't know that there was
enough variety or my agent

00:41:57.970 --> 00:42:00.820
didn't think that there
would be quite enough

00:42:00.820 --> 00:42:05.800
variety to the landscape
to make it a go.

00:42:05.800 --> 00:42:09.610
So I folded that into
"Packing for Mars."

00:42:09.610 --> 00:42:12.410
AUDIENCE: You do a lot of
traveling for your research.

00:42:12.410 --> 00:42:18.680
And it seems some places kind
of recur from book to book.

00:42:18.680 --> 00:42:21.870
And I was wondering,
on any given trip,

00:42:21.870 --> 00:42:25.850
how many different projects
are you working on at a time?

00:42:25.850 --> 00:42:28.817
MARY ROACH: On any given
trip, often just one chapter.

00:42:28.817 --> 00:42:29.400
AUDIENCE: Wow.

00:42:29.400 --> 00:42:30.510
MARY ROACH: Yeah.

00:42:30.510 --> 00:42:33.780
Well the India trip,
I was traveling

00:42:33.780 --> 00:42:36.880
with a friend who was
doing some charitable work

00:42:36.880 --> 00:42:39.460
for an organization called
Books and Water that

00:42:39.460 --> 00:42:42.270
tries to put in
wells in villages

00:42:42.270 --> 00:42:44.380
and portable libraries.

00:42:44.380 --> 00:42:45.670
So I was traveling with her.

00:42:45.670 --> 00:42:48.279
And then I she was
going to be in Nagaland.

00:42:48.279 --> 00:42:50.070
And I was Nagaland,
I've never heard of it.

00:42:50.070 --> 00:42:53.620
So I looked it up, heard about
the chili pepper contest,

00:42:53.620 --> 00:42:54.590
and pitched that.

00:42:54.590 --> 00:42:56.310
So I was doing two things there.

00:42:56.310 --> 00:42:58.270
But usually when I
travel somewhere,

00:42:58.270 --> 00:43:03.700
I'm only doing one
chunk of research.

00:43:03.700 --> 00:43:06.155
AUDIENCE: And here I was
envisioning some huge master

00:43:06.155 --> 00:43:06.950
plan.

00:43:06.950 --> 00:43:09.940
MARY ROACH: Yeah, you
know what, I'd love that.

00:43:09.940 --> 00:43:12.892
It never works out that way.

00:43:12.892 --> 00:43:14.350
And sometimes it
will be like, I've

00:43:14.350 --> 00:43:15.980
got to go to London for this.

00:43:15.980 --> 00:43:18.110
And then six weeks later
there's another thing.

00:43:18.110 --> 00:43:21.740
And I can't combine them because
it's all their schedule, not

00:43:21.740 --> 00:43:22.560
mine.

00:43:22.560 --> 00:43:25.490
So I'm constantly sort of
being buffeted here and there

00:43:25.490 --> 00:43:27.060
by researcher's schedules.

00:43:27.060 --> 00:43:30.440
Things get pushed
back and delayed.

00:43:30.440 --> 00:43:33.040
So I never go on a vacation
myself because I'm like,

00:43:33.040 --> 00:43:35.780
my cadaver project might
come through next month.

00:43:35.780 --> 00:43:36.730
Oh, it's been delayed.

00:43:36.730 --> 00:43:40.300
So I am constantly-- And I
don't do a lot of talks outside

00:43:40.300 --> 00:43:44.060
of book tour for that reason as
well, because I may need to up

00:43:44.060 --> 00:43:47.140
and go quickly.

00:43:47.140 --> 00:43:49.070
I wish.

00:43:49.070 --> 00:43:51.270
Anyone else?

00:43:51.270 --> 00:43:52.152
All right then.

00:43:52.152 --> 00:43:56.930
[APPLAUSE]

00:43:56.930 --> 00:43:59.620
Thanks a lot.
