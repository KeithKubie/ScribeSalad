JEFF POSNICK: Hi, everybody.

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.000
I'm Jeff Posnick from the
YouTube API Developer

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.520
Relations Team, and welcome to
this week's episode of YouTube

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:54.890
Developers Live.

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.050
Today's guest is Kris Schroder
from Next Big Sound.

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:02.220
And they're a pretty cool
company that's using--

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:05.350
primarily, we're going to talk
about your Analytics API use.

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:07.160
And really happy to have
you on the show.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.730
KRIS SCHRODER: Great.

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:08.210
Thanks, Jeff.

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:09.259
It's awesome to be here.

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:09.680
JEFF POSNICK: Awesome.

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:10.289
Thank you.

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.080
And I want to just go into a
little bit of background on

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.740
what Next Big Sound is all about
for the folks who might

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:17.030
not be familiar already.

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.390
KRIS SCHRODER: Sure.

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:20.700
So I'm a member of the
Engineering Team, and my role

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.550
is focused on integrations
with our

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:24.800
customers and partners.

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:28.580
So that's a little
about myself.

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:32.430
The company itself tracks the
online activity for almost

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.020
every band in the world and
then we organize that

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:38.130
information into a centralized
dashboard and provide that

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:39.660
back to the music industry.

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:44.280
So our customers include both
labels, who are very

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.340
interested in developing and
marketing artists, as well as

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.220
individual bands and band
managers, who are trying to

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.010
learn more about their fan base
and promote themselves on

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:54.440
social media and
other networks.

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.850
JEFF POSNICK: Cool.

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:57.480
And obviously YouTube is a
huge part of the music

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:57.795
ecosystem--

00:02:57.795 --> 00:02:58.620
KRIS SCHRODER: Absolutely.

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.010
JEFF POSNICK: --so being able
to get that type of

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:03.820
information for YouTube
play backs I'm

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:04.800
assuming is pretty important.

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.390
KRIS SCHRODER: Yeah,
tremendous.

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:09.800
Really interesting in so many
ways too, because it's not

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:14.100
just an amazing way for fans to
connect with artists, but

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:18.870
also you see new acts breaking
on YouTube in new ways that

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:20.030
were impossible before.

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:23.340
So getting a viral video or an
internet meme, or getting

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.660
discovered by making covers of
their favorite acts, and

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:30.680
aspiring artists that are trying
to grow a fan base and

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:31.623
get started that way.

00:03:31.623 --> 00:03:32.310
JEFF POSNICK: OK.

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:35.110
So you mentioned a little bit
about who the intended

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.800
audience is.

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:39.860
If you were a smaller act, can
you still use Next Big Sound

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:42.770
or is it mainly for
more established--

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:43.350
KRIS SCHRODER: Yes.

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:44.670
Yes, it's for both.

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:47.700
So all three major record labels
are our customers, but

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.020
we also have thousands of what
we call self-serve customers--

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:54.800
individual acts, bands, band
managers, people just getting

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:57.890
started who want to understand
like, I need to take advantage

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:02.420
of all these sources that are
out there, and where am I and

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:06.140
how do I compare to other acts
that I might aspire to.

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:07.284
JEFF POSNICK: Sure.

00:04:07.284 --> 00:04:07.726
Cool.

00:04:07.726 --> 00:04:08.400
OK.

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.580
Well, that's a bit of a
overview, but it's always

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:15.130
really nice to see live demos
of what we're talking about.

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:18.660
So before we go any further, if
you want to start driving

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:19.440
the web interface.

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:20.399
KRIS SCHRODER: That
sounds great.

00:04:20.399 --> 00:04:21.510
JEFF POSNICK: Show us what
you're all about.

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:23.220
KRIS SCHRODER: Cool.

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:26.260
So right now we're looking
at our home page.

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.360
We're a web-based
app obviously.

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:33.870
And if I log in, this is the
artist overview home page that

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:35.000
you are taken to.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.320
So any acts like yourself or
others that you're interested

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:41.180
in that you want to report on,
you would subscribe to and

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:42.790
include here.

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:46.070
But what I wanted to show you
was specifically an example of

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:46.970
YouTube data.

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:51.480
So I'm sure we're all familiar
with Psy and his story.

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:52.210
It's amazing.

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:54.970
But if we go in here, we have
a bunch of different data.

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:58.430
This is the artist overview
page, and right now we're

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:01.620
getting a quick look at some key
metrics that I've decided

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:04.620
that are important to me and
really the values for the past

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:09.230
week as well as how they've
changed week over week.

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:11.570
I'm also getting information
on particular tracks on the

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:15.440
left-hand side and then also
gender and age information

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:16.385
from different sources.

00:05:16.385 --> 00:05:17.270
JEFF POSNICK: Sure.

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:22.120
And just to be clear, we are not
here showing any private

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:23.470
data about Psy.

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:25.000
The data on this particular
page is

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.740
publicly available data--

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:27.270
KRIS SCHRODER: That's right.

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:27.996
JEFF POSNICK: --about
the YouTube views.

00:05:27.996 --> 00:05:31.030
But I know that there is
a separate kind of like

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:32.750
authenticated mode where you're
actually using the

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:35.450
Analytics API to pull some
additional data.

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:38.115
We're not going to be able to
demo that right now, but--

00:05:38.115 --> 00:05:38.890
KRIS SCHRODER: So basically--

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:41.200
JEFF POSNICK: --do believe
me that it exists.

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:41.470
KRIS SCHRODER: Great.

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:43.270
Basically, the data that you're
seeing right now is

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:45.890
data that you could go and see
yourself and if you had a

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:47.920
pencil and paper every day,
went and tracked it down.

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:50.740
So it's all public information,
and then for

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:52.570
YouTube Analytics, that
integration--

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:55.490
it's just like you said-- it's
an authorized source and that

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:57.210
gives you much more
granularity.

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:59.430
But just to give you an overview
of the type of

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:04.150
information we have, I think
this will work great.

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:09.600
If we go to the graph section,
I'm looking at a graph of

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:17.480
YouTube views for Psy for
the past 90 days.

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:19.540
And so it's really
interesting.

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:20.870
He has a couple different
spikes.

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:23.890
In addition to collecting data
from multiple sources, social

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:27.830
media, et cetera, we also
collect event data so you can

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:32.040
look at key points in time and
compare them to what might be

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:34.300
driving up that spike in
YouTube plays on that

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:35.130
particular day.

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:36.410
JEFF POSNICK: That's
interesting.

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:38.520
Where do you pull that
sort of information?

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:39.425
KRIS SCHRODER: All
over the place.

00:06:39.425 --> 00:06:42.910
So there's different
sources for music--

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:44.925
these names are escaping
me right now--

00:06:44.925 --> 00:06:47.670
where you can pull concert
information,

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:49.800
appearances on charts.

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:53.600
If we notice something shows
up-- so like a new video on

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:55.180
YouTube, for instance--
we'll turn that

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:56.440
into an event ourselves.

00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:58.700
So really just scouring as
many different possible

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:00.360
sources as we can get
our hands on.

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:01.690
JEFF POSNICK: Cool.

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:02.000
KRIS SCHRODER: Twitter--

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.520
JEFF POSNICK: Even for the data
that you might be pulling

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:06.450
from publicly available sources,
it seems like you're

00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:10.050
adding a lot of value from
intelligently presenting it

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:13.206
and making some-- you know
helping people discover some

00:07:13.206 --> 00:07:15.000
things that they might not see
if they were just looking at

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:15.640
numbers rather--

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:16.390
KRIS SCHRODER: Right.

00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:17.660
JEFF POSNICK: So that's
really cool.

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:18.900
KRIS SCHRODER: That's
the goal.

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:20.500
And then another idea--

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:23.780
bringing the YouTube analytics
into Next Big Sound means that

00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:25.820
not only can you look at just
the YouTube analytics data but

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:29.120
compare it to the events that
we find and compare it to

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:32.130
other social media sources
and whatnot.

00:07:32.130 --> 00:07:33.022
JEFF POSNICK: Cool.

00:07:33.022 --> 00:07:35.750
KRIS SCHRODER: Yeah, so
continuing with this example.

00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:38.760
So I just looked at events for
this day and it turns out the

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:43.220
reason it spiked there was it
looks like Psy released a new

00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:47.250
video, "The Gangnam Shake,"
on YouTube.

00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:49.240
So I think we can imagine
what that is.

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:49.510
JEFF POSNICK: Yes.

00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:52.520
I don't think we can play
it right now, but--

00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:54.250
KRIS SCHRODER: And then
this huge jump, I

00:07:54.250 --> 00:07:56.526
mean 48 million views.

00:07:56.526 --> 00:08:00.720
This is the release of his
newer video for that

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:04.910
"Gentleman" song, which people
are wondering can Psy do it

00:08:04.910 --> 00:08:06.590
again and have another
great hit.

00:08:06.590 --> 00:08:09.706
And it looks like at least for
now that's what's happening.

00:08:09.706 --> 00:08:11.990
JEFF POSNICK: Cool.

00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:15.245
That seems really compelling
unless there's anything else

00:08:15.245 --> 00:08:16.480
you wanted to demo.

00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:17.640
KRIS SCHRODER: Yeah, I just
wanted to give an

00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:21.360
example of if we--

00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:23.430
and on top that, like Wikipedia
page views.

00:08:23.430 --> 00:08:26.900
Now it's not on the same scale
yet, but if I just change over

00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:30.420
to a relative view of the data,
you can start seeing

00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:33.200
things like, all right, well
not only did releasing that

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:37.100
video drive people to YouTube
to watch the video, but it

00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:40.030
meant people were going online
and going to Wikipedia and

00:08:40.030 --> 00:08:41.230
learning about Psy.

00:08:41.230 --> 00:08:43.950
And so Wikipedia is an
interesting source,

00:08:43.950 --> 00:08:46.170
complementary source, because
that's where people go to

00:08:46.170 --> 00:08:48.890
learn about artists
more so than the

00:08:48.890 --> 00:08:49.930
artist's own web page.

00:08:49.930 --> 00:08:52.175
JEFF POSNICK: Very cool.

00:08:52.175 --> 00:08:53.025
Awesome.

00:08:53.025 --> 00:08:55.580
Do you want to dive into some of
the technical details about

00:08:55.580 --> 00:08:58.630
how you've implemented to this,
and specifically how

00:08:58.630 --> 00:09:01.940
you're using the YouTube
APIs to pull--

00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:02.470
KRIS SCHRODER: OK.

00:09:02.470 --> 00:09:05.750
JEFF POSNICK: So some background
on how you've

00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:07.620
actually built this if you
want to get into it.

00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:08.380
KRIS SCHRODER: The platform?

00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:10.585
JEFF POSNICK: Yeah, what kind
of stack are you running on?

00:09:10.585 --> 00:09:11.920
KRIS SCHRODER: Yeah, sure.

00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:12.240
Sure.

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:12.870
Definitely.

00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:19.090
So the front end is mainly PHP
backbone.js, and then our back

00:09:19.090 --> 00:09:24.760
end is mainly a large
Cassandra cluster.

00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:27.090
And so that's housing
all of our raw

00:09:27.090 --> 00:09:30.990
data, time series data.

00:09:30.990 --> 00:09:33.770
It was the perfect database
for that because it's just

00:09:33.770 --> 00:09:36.250
great for scaling and handling
that large amount of data,

00:09:36.250 --> 00:09:38.870
lots of concurrent rights,
that type of stuff.

00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:40.040
JEFF POSNICK: OK.

00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:40.570
Very cool.

00:09:40.570 --> 00:09:44.240
And obviously YouTube Analytics
is one of the major

00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:46.530
sources of data for people
who have gone through the

00:09:46.530 --> 00:09:49.730
authorization flow and said
explicitly, yes, run analytics

00:09:49.730 --> 00:09:52.610
for my channel, so how are you
integrating with that?

00:09:52.610 --> 00:09:54.210
What language are you--

00:09:54.210 --> 00:09:55.440
KRIS SCHRODER: So that's--

00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:57.870
our data integrations,
[INAUDIBLE]

00:09:57.870 --> 00:10:00.860
our data collectors and our
data crawlers, they're all

00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:02.180
written in Java.

00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:04.160
So it's pretty much standalone
Java app

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:05.730
that runs on a schedule.

00:10:05.730 --> 00:10:09.850
And then we're using very basic
straightforward standard

00:10:09.850 --> 00:10:13.320
HTTP client to go ahead and
create the calls to grab the

00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:17.850
data from YouTube, and since
it's JSON, it's really

00:10:17.850 --> 00:10:18.760
easy to work with.

00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:19.030
JEFF POSNICK: OK.

00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:22.050
And you go through the standard
OAuth 2 flow in

00:10:22.050 --> 00:10:24.510
advance and ask for
credentials and

00:10:24.510 --> 00:10:25.210
that sort of thing.

00:10:25.210 --> 00:10:25.790
KRIS SCHRODER: Exactly.

00:10:25.790 --> 00:10:30.670
So we use OAuth 2 and we have
to redirect the user to a

00:10:30.670 --> 00:10:35.500
Google authentication page and
we save that token and then

00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:38.010
each day as we go in, we have
to go and refresh those

00:10:38.010 --> 00:10:40.480
tokens, so there's a little
bit of management of the

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:45.030
connection of those types of
things that can come up, but

00:10:45.030 --> 00:10:47.810
that's the nature of an API,
so no surprise there.

00:10:47.810 --> 00:10:51.090
It's actually been pretty
smooth integration.

00:10:51.090 --> 00:10:52.630
JEFF POSNICK: Very cool.

00:10:52.630 --> 00:10:56.310
So you're kind of running your
analytics polls more or less

00:10:56.310 --> 00:10:57.240
on a regular timer.

00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:58.620
It's not like On Demand
when somebody

00:10:58.620 --> 00:11:00.326
loads a page that you--

00:11:00.326 --> 00:11:01.115
KRIS SCHRODER: That's right.

00:11:01.115 --> 00:11:01.420
Yeah.

00:11:01.420 --> 00:11:04.650
Cause as you can see in our
interface, people are choosing

00:11:04.650 --> 00:11:06.770
different time ranges.

00:11:06.770 --> 00:11:09.380
So what we actually do is we're
going to go in and we're

00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:12.170
going to get the daily values
for every artist that is

00:11:12.170 --> 00:11:16.550
registered for every channel
and for every video, all of

00:11:16.550 --> 00:11:19.780
the different view metrics,
engagement metrics.

00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:23.160
We don't really go into
annotations or some of the

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:29.070
things that are more I feel
like ad focused features.

00:11:29.070 --> 00:11:33.200
But plays, unique plays, the
geographic data and the

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:35.790
demographic data, we all
grab from there.

00:11:35.790 --> 00:11:37.230
And yeah.

00:11:37.230 --> 00:11:39.020
JEFF POSNICK: I don't know if
you've had any outstanding

00:11:39.020 --> 00:11:40.770
feature requests for this but
one of the things we did

00:11:40.770 --> 00:11:45.250
recently add to the Analytics
API was access to monetization

00:11:45.250 --> 00:11:47.630
details, so if you do have
people that have been

00:11:47.630 --> 00:11:51.350
clamoring to see how much their
ad revenue has been for

00:11:51.350 --> 00:11:52.780
certain videos, you
can now start

00:11:52.780 --> 00:11:54.060
exposing that if you wanted.

00:11:54.060 --> 00:11:54.455
KRIS SCHRODER: Cool.

00:11:54.455 --> 00:11:55.610
JEFF POSNICK: Just throwing
that out there.

00:11:55.610 --> 00:11:58.180
Kind of a plug for some new
functionality that we've added

00:11:58.180 --> 00:11:59.420
to the API.

00:11:59.420 --> 00:12:03.970
I know a lot of analytics users
were asking for that.

00:12:03.970 --> 00:12:05.250
KRIS SCHRODER: Cool.

00:12:05.250 --> 00:12:06.930
I mean, there's been a lot of
excitement from the industry

00:12:06.930 --> 00:12:10.916
about this and from our
record label partners.

00:12:10.916 --> 00:12:14.600
I'll have to look into how
this can come into play.

00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:16.130
JEFF POSNICK: Very cool.

00:12:16.130 --> 00:12:21.700
Any kind of best practices or
anything that kind of you ran

00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:24.740
into that was not immediately
clear that you want to share a

00:12:24.740 --> 00:12:28.920
solution to or put me on
the spot and ask why we

00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:30.360
implemented something
in a certain way?

00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:32.840
I'll obviously deflect,
but you know.

00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:36.310
KRIS SCHRODER: Yeah, I mean in
terms of the challenges that

00:12:36.310 --> 00:12:40.820
we ran into-- just the fact that
we are collecting so much

00:12:40.820 --> 00:12:45.820
data on a daily granularity, we
had to be mindful of how we

00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:47.980
created our queries.

00:12:47.980 --> 00:12:52.470
So as you use the API, you learn
things like geography

00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:55.820
and daily having data sliced
by both at the same

00:12:55.820 --> 00:12:58.340
time isn't an option.

00:12:58.340 --> 00:12:59.220
Right.

00:12:59.220 --> 00:13:01.810
And certain metrics can't be
queried with other metrics, so

00:13:01.810 --> 00:13:03.580
to get all of that--

00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:04.890
JEFF POSNICK: That's another
thing that's actually gotten

00:13:04.890 --> 00:13:06.826
better for folks who are
watching who might have run

00:13:06.826 --> 00:13:08.670
into this before.

00:13:08.670 --> 00:13:10.415
We need to make more noise
about these changes.

00:13:10.415 --> 00:13:13.610
But you can now query for
minutes watched, like all the

00:13:13.610 --> 00:13:19.120
watch time data, along with the
standard views and likes

00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:20.120
and all that other data.

00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:22.570
So you did use to have to
do two separate queries.

00:13:22.570 --> 00:13:24.890
You can now do them in one.

00:13:24.890 --> 00:13:26.570
Maybe that cuts the number
of queries you

00:13:26.570 --> 00:13:27.210
have to do in half.

00:13:27.210 --> 00:13:28.660
KRIS SCHRODER: That's
going to help a lot.

00:13:28.660 --> 00:13:29.210
Absolutely.

00:13:29.210 --> 00:13:31.770
JEFF POSNICK: Well it's a good
thing you were on the show.

00:13:31.770 --> 00:13:34.140
Yeah, this obviously doesn't
scale super well where we

00:13:34.140 --> 00:13:36.450
invite people on the show in
order for them to learn about

00:13:36.450 --> 00:13:40.930
new API features, so follow
us on +YouTube [INAUDIBLE]

00:13:40.930 --> 00:13:44.300
on Google Plus and we'll make
sure to share these updates.

00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:47.670
And we actually do have RSS
feeds now of our documentation

00:13:47.670 --> 00:13:51.705
whenever we release something
new, so you can subscribe to

00:13:51.705 --> 00:13:54.830
that and find out what's been
added to our different APIs.

00:13:54.830 --> 00:13:56.216
KRIS SCHRODER: Great.

00:13:56.216 --> 00:13:59.120
JEFF POSNICK: Yeah, so a
little plug for that.

00:13:59.120 --> 00:13:59.210
OK.

00:13:59.210 --> 00:14:03.330
So managing your request time,
and I know that a lot of

00:14:03.330 --> 00:14:05.780
partners who've started working
with the Analytics API

00:14:05.780 --> 00:14:10.580
have run into that and I think
the temptation's always I want

00:14:10.580 --> 00:14:13.560
to request information about
every single video I know

00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:15.575
about as frequently
as possible.

00:14:15.575 --> 00:14:19.660
I want to get as much data as
possible, and we sympathize

00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:23.320
with that, but you do need to
be a little less aggressive

00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:25.500
than pulling everything.

00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:27.800
Some of the things that we
recommend folks do is for

00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:30.940
instance, instead of if you
happen to manage tens of

00:14:30.940 --> 00:14:32.705
thousands, hundreds of thousands
of videos that you

00:14:32.705 --> 00:14:36.220
want to pull reports for, don't
do it every night but

00:14:36.220 --> 00:14:39.360
maybe do it every three nights
and request data for the past

00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:40.220
three days.

00:14:40.220 --> 00:14:40.970
Something like that.

00:14:40.970 --> 00:14:44.300
So you kind of lose a little bit
of the real time element,

00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:47.080
but it scales a lot
better basically.

00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:49.730
So I'm not sure if that's
something that you kind of--

00:14:49.730 --> 00:14:50.906
KRIS SCHRODER: It is.

00:14:50.906 --> 00:14:51.300
It is.

00:14:51.300 --> 00:14:52.446
It is.

00:14:52.446 --> 00:14:55.550
The second an artist-- or excuse
me, the second a user

00:14:55.550 --> 00:14:58.210
connects their YouTube Analytics
to our dashboard

00:14:58.210 --> 00:14:58.960
they're like, great.

00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:00.210
Show me all my data.

00:15:00.210 --> 00:15:02.200
It's like, all right, well we
have to grab a little bit of

00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:05.720
it at a time, maybe five day
segments and work backwards in

00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:09.450
time to get all that
data so it'll grow.

00:15:09.450 --> 00:15:10.050
But--

00:15:10.050 --> 00:15:14.860
JEFF POSNICK: I think you can
do a pretty large date range

00:15:14.860 --> 00:15:15.830
in your requests.

00:15:15.830 --> 00:15:16.310
KRIS SCHRODER: Sometimes.

00:15:16.310 --> 00:15:19.430
Some requests we can, and then
other requests where we want

00:15:19.430 --> 00:15:23.380
the geographic data also, each
request is technically its own

00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:26.560
single day range, so it ends up
being an extra query just

00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:27.370
to get that one day.

00:15:27.370 --> 00:15:27.865
JEFF POSNICK: OK.

00:15:27.865 --> 00:15:29.350
KRIS SCHRODER: So it's
tricky for us.

00:15:29.350 --> 00:15:32.060
JEFF POSNICK: We'll see what we
can do about that, because

00:15:32.060 --> 00:15:35.820
I'm not really sure why we have
that limitation but maybe

00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:38.570
we could help.

00:15:38.570 --> 00:15:41.345
KRIS SCHRODER: Besides that, I
mean the big takeaway that I

00:15:41.345 --> 00:15:44.080
would say for the API is
that it is extremely

00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:46.500
straightforward and flexible.

00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:47.820
There's a lot of great
data in there.

00:15:47.820 --> 00:15:49.890
Almost everything I've seen
in the YouTube Analytics

00:15:49.890 --> 00:15:52.630
dashboard itself is available
through this API, which is

00:15:52.630 --> 00:15:54.080
just really awesome.

00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:55.730
That's really great.

00:15:55.730 --> 00:15:57.830
And then the types of challenges
I ran into I would

00:15:57.830 --> 00:16:01.530
say are not deal breakers or
major compared to just the

00:16:01.530 --> 00:16:03.920
value that you get
from the API.

00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:07.200
Generally, things just work
like they should and--

00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:09.340
JEFF POSNICK: That's
excellent feedback.

00:16:09.340 --> 00:16:13.490
Hopefully our engineers who
wrote the API are watching and

00:16:13.490 --> 00:16:15.760
virtual pat on your
back for that.

00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:19.305
And it's great to see these APIs
used in really compelling

00:16:19.305 --> 00:16:20.440
and interesting ways.

00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:23.930
KRIS SCHRODER: And for me, the
biggest help was the API

00:16:23.930 --> 00:16:28.650
Explorer was a great tool to
use and it just really just

00:16:28.650 --> 00:16:31.140
clears up any mystery about
what's happening when you make

00:16:31.140 --> 00:16:31.570
these queries.

00:16:31.570 --> 00:16:32.890
It's pretty straightforward.

00:16:32.890 --> 00:16:34.500
JEFF POSNICK: Yeah, we've
covered that in some

00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:36.320
previous GDL shows.

00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:38.900
I'm not sure that we have time
to pull it up now but just

00:16:38.900 --> 00:16:42.170
basically you can search for
Google APIs Explorer and it

00:16:42.170 --> 00:16:45.050
give you that live interface
where you can try out any

00:16:45.050 --> 00:16:45.530
sample queries.

00:16:45.530 --> 00:16:48.410
It's not just for the Analytics
API but for all our

00:16:48.410 --> 00:16:51.610
data APIs and pretty much all
our Google APIs across the

00:16:51.610 --> 00:16:54.160
board without having
to write code.

00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:56.130
Specifically, I do this
all the time too.

00:16:56.130 --> 00:16:59.340
If you're running an analytics
report, the tricky part is

00:16:59.340 --> 00:17:00.580
getting the report
definition right.

00:17:00.580 --> 00:17:03.280
It's not necessarily writing
Java code or

00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:04.380
PHP code to do it.

00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:06.599
It's like, what should
my report look like?

00:17:06.599 --> 00:17:09.020
So API Explorer definitely
helps with that.

00:17:09.020 --> 00:17:11.280
KRIS SCHRODER: Cool.

00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:13.969
JEFF POSNICK: Any other feedback
about the experience

00:17:13.969 --> 00:17:15.560
that you want to share?

00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:16.490
I know that--

00:17:16.490 --> 00:17:17.849
I don't want to take
away too much.

00:17:17.849 --> 00:17:21.349
I'm deliberately not asking Kris
certain things cause Kris

00:17:21.349 --> 00:17:24.609
is actually going to be onstage
next week at the

00:17:24.609 --> 00:17:26.109
Google I/O conference.

00:17:26.109 --> 00:17:29.650
He's going to be presenting
somewhat similar material but

00:17:29.650 --> 00:17:33.130
some new stuff too about how
Next Big Sound is using

00:17:33.130 --> 00:17:36.420
Analytics API as part of
one of our sessions.

00:17:36.420 --> 00:17:39.150
So I know not everybody's going
to be able to make it

00:17:39.150 --> 00:17:42.460
out to Google I/O. We're going
to have a recording of his

00:17:42.460 --> 00:17:46.460
session video available
hopefully not too late after

00:17:46.460 --> 00:17:51.370
that, so if you like what you
learned on this show, I

00:17:51.370 --> 00:17:54.840
definitely recommend that folks
check out the video once

00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:57.100
that's available, once I/O
actually happens, once

00:17:57.100 --> 00:18:01.580
[INAUDIBLE], Kris will be
talking in even more detail.

00:18:01.580 --> 00:18:01.930
KRIS SCHRODER: Yeah.

00:18:01.930 --> 00:18:04.260
We have a lot of great stuff
lined up for that.

00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:09.360
Some really good specific
examples of real world artists

00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:11.970
where the data has been prepared
and scrubbed, because

00:18:11.970 --> 00:18:14.110
it is private data so we--

00:18:14.110 --> 00:18:16.020
it's really interesting, but
we have to be careful about

00:18:16.020 --> 00:18:17.380
how we show it.

00:18:17.380 --> 00:18:21.960
So you'll have to go watch the
Google I/O session to see it.

00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:23.550
JEFF POSNICK: Absolutely.

00:18:23.550 --> 00:18:24.650
Well great.

00:18:24.650 --> 00:18:28.830
So yeah, we are going to be at
Google I/O next week so there

00:18:28.830 --> 00:18:31.090
won't be a show at our regularly
scheduled slot but

00:18:31.090 --> 00:18:33.740
there's going to be all this
great recorded Google I/O

00:18:33.740 --> 00:18:35.780
content that we're going to make
available for folks to

00:18:35.780 --> 00:18:37.120
watch after the fact.

00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:41.850
And I know that the whole Google
Developers Live series

00:18:41.850 --> 00:18:44.690
is going to be live at I/O for
a bunch of other things, so

00:18:44.690 --> 00:18:47.910
there's going to be plenty of
content for folks even if

00:18:47.910 --> 00:18:49.760
you're not able to make
it to I/O to watch.

00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:52.620
So stay tuned for that.

00:18:52.620 --> 00:18:57.670
And this is Jeff Posnick, Kris
Schroder from Next Big Sound.

00:18:57.670 --> 00:19:00.570
Thanks so much for watching our
show this week and we'll

00:19:00.570 --> 00:19:01.820
talk to you soon.
