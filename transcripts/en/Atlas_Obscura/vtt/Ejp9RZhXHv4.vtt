- Hi, I'm Dylan Thuras of Atlas Obscura.

00:00:03.429 --> 00:00:05.385
Welcome back to the YouTube Channel.

00:00:05.385 --> 00:00:08.937
In case you've forgotten who I am,

00:00:08.937 --> 00:00:10.728
what Atlas Obscura is,

00:00:10.728 --> 00:00:12.038
what we're all doing here,

00:00:12.038 --> 00:00:14.912
let me give you a quick refresher.

00:00:14.912 --> 00:00:15.745
I'm Dylan,

00:00:15.745 --> 00:00:19.788
Atlas Obscura is an organization dedicated

00:00:19.788 --> 00:00:21.834
to the world's hidden wonders.

00:00:21.834 --> 00:00:23.384
We've been growing our database

00:00:23.384 --> 00:00:25.886
of 15 thousand places all over the world.

00:00:25.886 --> 00:00:28.761
We also share incredible foods,

00:00:28.761 --> 00:00:30.704
unusual dishes, and ingredients.

00:00:30.704 --> 00:00:32.625
We are running events
all over the country.

00:00:32.625 --> 00:00:35.270
We are taking trips all over the world

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:37.616
and on top of all of that,

00:00:37.616 --> 00:00:40.535
we are gonna be adding a ton of new video,

00:00:40.535 --> 00:00:43.879
incredible series to this YouTube channel.

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:46.217
We are gonna be doing more
than just 100 Wonders,

00:00:46.217 --> 00:00:47.936
which was the main video previously.

00:00:47.936 --> 00:00:51.301
We are gonna be giving you
a series about collectors.

00:00:51.301 --> 00:00:54.439
People who have unbelievable
objects in their

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:56.081
homes, basements, barns.

00:00:56.081 --> 00:00:58.021
We're gonna be doing series
about incredible artists

00:00:58.021 --> 00:01:00.481
like a miniature artist
who builds little versions

00:01:00.481 --> 00:01:02.534
of buildings about to be torn down.

00:01:02.534 --> 00:01:05.571
Unbelievable skill and craftsmanship.

00:01:05.571 --> 00:01:06.674
We're gonna do food videos

00:01:06.674 --> 00:01:08.614
about how to make the
world's bounciest meatball.

00:01:08.614 --> 00:01:11.270
It is so incredibly bouncy.

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:13.828
You would not believe how bouncy it is.

00:01:13.828 --> 00:01:16.523
So, for all of you who love
the 100 Wonders series,

00:01:16.523 --> 00:01:18.749
you're gonna see me, you're
gonna get videos about places

00:01:18.749 --> 00:01:20.082
but, you're gonna meet new people.

00:01:20.082 --> 00:01:21.948

00:01:21.948 --> 00:01:24.388
and all of its live here

00:01:24.388 --> 00:01:27.349

these videos up on the channel.
