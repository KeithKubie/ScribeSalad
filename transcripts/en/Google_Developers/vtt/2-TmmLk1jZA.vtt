[SIDE CONVERSATIONS]

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.020
SPEAKER 1: So, while
everyone is coming back,

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:12.300
I'll introduce Alexandra.

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.620
Alexandra
Deschamps-Sonsino, she is

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:20.010
an expert in internet of things,
a designer, and an innovator.

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.620
Some of her work has been
exhibited at the MoMA,

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:26.190
at the Victoria and
Albert Museum in London,

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:28.350
and the Design Museum in London.

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:30.450
And we look forward
to hear from her

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:32.189
around the internet of things.

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:40.029
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:43.319 --> 00:00:45.610
ALEXANDRA DESCHAMPS-SONSINO:
I like how this is written

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:49.050
according to how
my passport is--

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.690
kind of the name on my passport.

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.290
They fucked up
and there's a dash

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:59.290
between the two, which now I
have to get used to not using,

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:00.200
it's very strange.

00:01:04.709 --> 00:01:05.680
Awesome.

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.160
So I've posted these slides
online in case some of you

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.890
would like to express read
them and not listen to me,

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:13.660
which does happen sometimes.

00:01:16.487 --> 00:01:17.570
Thank you for inviting me.

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:20.860
This is quite an unusual
event for me to attend.

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:27.430
I can't remember the last time
I said interaction design, HCI,

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:31.540
in a willing manner.

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:35.440
I tend to speak at quite
a lot of tech conferences,

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:40.000
people who do tech in a very
specific way, which is usually

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.005
the internet of things.

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:48.820
You'll find that I am this
kind of odd mixture, perhaps,

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:52.750
of someone who has a deep
history with some people

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:56.200
in the room who it's a
great pleasure to see,

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.390
because we don't see
each other very often.

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:04.000
It's even a bigger pleasure to
be speaking before one of them.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.740
But also, I have progressed in a
really interesting manner where

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:11.590
now I spend a lot of
my time just writing.

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.230
I don't do a lot of design work.

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:17.380
I studied industrial
design, which I think

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:18.955
is a field that
will eventually die.

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:22.990
Yeah, go good.

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:29.710
And I also am finding
myself turning to old tools

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:33.460
more and more and old ways of
thinking more and more, which

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:37.030
is I'm probably the only person
who dragged along two books--

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.430
which I will be
referencing in my talk,

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.620
but I also have in real life--

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.560
should you want to look
at them before committing

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.860
to an online purchase.

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:52.070
It's like a lending
library on the go.

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:54.700
So I studied industrial
design, interaction design.

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.160
I was the first UK
distributor of the Arduino.

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.790
Who here knows what
the Arduino is?

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:02.390
That's not bad at all.

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:04.540
If you do not, it
is a credit card

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:09.160
sized open hardware education
platform for electronics.

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:10.760
If you've heard of
the Raspberry Pi,

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.843
it was a thing that was
there before the Raspberry

00:03:12.843 --> 00:03:17.020
Pi was there and helped along
that whole ecology of products.

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:20.350
And I'm sure that Haiyan's work
will illustrate that further.

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:25.000
I have no examples of
the Arduino in this talk.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.710
I do a lot of work
with a variety

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:28.960
of clients, usually
telling them what

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:33.669
I think about the internet of
things within their sector.

00:03:33.669 --> 00:03:35.960
I'm also the founder of
something called the Good Night

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:38.910
Lamp, which I'm also
not going to talk about.

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:42.530
But it is a family of lamps
for global friends and family

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:47.120
that uses GSM, which
I don't recommend--

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:50.090
not the Good Night Lamp,
but just as a technology

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:51.890
stack to play with.

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:53.660
And for the last
seven years, I've

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:57.232
been the organizer of the London
internet of things Meetup.

00:03:57.232 --> 00:03:58.940
You do have a meetup
here, which is where

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:00.300
I was speaking last night.

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:02.960
So and I do encourage
you to go to the Zurich

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:06.310
internet of things Meetup that
is run by my friend Thomas.

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:07.190
It's excellent.

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:08.270
And they're nice people.

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:11.090
They need a bit more
attendance from nice people

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:14.240
like yourself to have good
conversations about what

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:16.070
it means in Switzerland
to be an IoT.

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:22.200
I'm going to start with
something I never do,

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:24.270
which is sort of
quotes from people,

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:27.840
from famous people who usually
end up being white men.

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:31.140
But I find these
useful, because they

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:34.650
relate to the things I'm going
to talk about, one of which

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:37.410
is "Evolution is
apparently intent

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:39.930
that man fulfil a much
greater destiny than that

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:43.890
of being a simple muscle
and reflex machine."

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:45.734
And I think that
presentations that we've

00:04:45.734 --> 00:04:47.400
heard this morning
and the conversations

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.290
that you must have
as an organization

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:51.990
relate to this
tension where we know

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:56.100
that the computer is there to
help us become something more.

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:58.060
It's just that so
much of our society

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:01.860
is actually built on the
idea of us being less

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:05.320
and being a reflex
muscle, machine.

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:10.400
The other one is--

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:12.220
and they're from
the same person,

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:13.535
weirdly, in the same book.

00:05:13.535 --> 00:05:14.510
So it's quite handy.

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:17.150
And I have that book here--

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:20.630
is the "Behavior of
whole systems unpredicted

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:22.910
by the separately
observed behaviors of any

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:25.760
of the system's separate
parts or any subassembly

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:27.770
of the system's parts."

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:31.790
This is the definition
of Buckminster Fuller

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:37.190
for the word synergy, which we
don't use on purpose at all.

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:39.430
We kind of use in
quotation marks.

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:40.880
It's like the word
that everybody

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:43.280
hates using but
sometimes accidentally

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:46.670
uses to mean something
completely different.

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:48.350
And I find that
fascinating, because I

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:51.080
think that a lot of
the conversations that

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:55.640
are happening in the world,
that Sarah's work encapsulates,

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:58.640
some of the people who are here
from doteveryone encapsulates,

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:00.700
and some of my work
these days encapsulates

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:04.460
is this misunderstanding
of the parts

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:08.630
and misunderstanding of
the influence on the whole.

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:11.780
So maybe we should take
synergy and revisit it

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:13.695
with Buckminster Fuller's
sort of approach.

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:20.060
And I think, these
days, I kind of

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:22.250
feel like we're prepared
for the apocalypse

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:24.000
that we sort of planned for.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.570
We have this imagery,
for the last 100 years--

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:28.470
and I'm writing a book
about smart homes.

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:33.920
So let me tell you I'm basking
in images of the future that

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:38.480
are very much about
things being connected,

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:42.830
this kind of hyperconnectivity
and, ultimately, a future

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:46.010
that is mathematically
coherent somehow.

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:48.450
There's always a circle.

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:50.755
There's always a
circle around things.

00:06:50.755 --> 00:06:53.190
There's always circles
within circles.

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:54.960
There's lines of things.

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:57.510
Everything kind
of mathematically

00:06:57.510 --> 00:06:59.940
somehow makes sense.

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:02.900
And visually, we feel like,
yeah, yeah, this is totally it.

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:07.057
This is totally
the future we want.

00:07:07.057 --> 00:07:08.890
And I find that that's,
of course, a problem

00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:10.450
because I don't
think that it allows

00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:15.220
us to account for the times
when it's not like that, which

00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:17.620
is almost always.

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:20.920
But we feel like we want
this future somehow,

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:23.535
because, you know, a
circle is a great shape.

00:07:23.535 --> 00:07:27.750
It's a great shape
to believe in.

00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:29.430
Triangles are also great shapes.

00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:31.630
You use them a lot.

00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:35.370
I don't have a triangle
in this presentation.

00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:38.010
But I find it more interesting
to think about futures

00:07:38.010 --> 00:07:39.750
that are completely incoherent.

00:07:39.750 --> 00:07:42.820
And this is only a
very recent position.

00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:46.090
This is not the kind of stuff
that I have done my whole life.

00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:51.120
This is just a compound
of events and projects

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:54.210
that I have spent more
and more of my time

00:07:54.210 --> 00:07:55.890
on that I'd like
to share with you.

00:07:58.770 --> 00:08:02.840
Predominantly, something
called the Open IoT Mark.

00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:06.580
I'll talk about what it is,
but it is a baby project.

00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:08.610
It's sort of at its infancy.

00:08:08.610 --> 00:08:11.360
It's less than a year old.

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:13.600
And it is an attempt
by a community

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:16.000
of people that are
less than 100 to look

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:21.670
at what it might mean to create
a certification mark for IoT.

00:08:21.670 --> 00:08:26.190
So think of Fair Trade and
the Fair Trade sticker.

00:08:26.190 --> 00:08:30.820
77% of British people know what
a Fair Trade sticker means.

00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:34.650
It's a very clear, very
well-publicized sticker.

00:08:34.650 --> 00:08:36.400
Think of what that
might mean in the world

00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:38.650
of connected products.

00:08:38.650 --> 00:08:40.630
What does trust
mean, ethics mean?

00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:43.360
How do we do something
that is a Fair Trade

00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:47.024
sticker for the world
of connected products?

00:08:47.024 --> 00:08:48.190
That's what we're exploring.

00:08:48.190 --> 00:08:50.398
That's what I'm spending
more and more of my time on.

00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:56.900
And in the things that we're
exploring-- and this is a very,

00:08:56.900 --> 00:08:59.690
again, small group of
people, mostly technologists,

00:08:59.690 --> 00:09:02.690
would really appreciate
anyone in this room,

00:09:02.690 --> 00:09:05.180
and in the extended
Google family

00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:07.760
to have a look at what we're
doing-- but we're exploring

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:09.730
ideas of trusts and risk.

00:09:12.530 --> 00:09:15.257
This is the more recent--

00:09:15.257 --> 00:09:17.840
I suppose it's not technically
the more recent of my examples,

00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:20.450
but it's the more recent
in a tangible way, which

00:09:20.450 --> 00:09:22.925
is the VW emissions scandal.

00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:28.650
A corporation, which
I shall not name,

00:09:28.650 --> 00:09:32.690
which is German,
and a foundation,

00:09:32.690 --> 00:09:39.930
provided the censors to VW to
actually measure the emissions.

00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:42.690
And in the world of
engineering, doing that,

00:09:42.690 --> 00:09:45.570
you have to do it in
a very particular way.

00:09:45.570 --> 00:09:48.660
And so someone, somewhere
sent an email to VW

00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:53.820
to say, yeah, by the
way, just keep in mind

00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:56.370
that this could be abused.

00:09:56.370 --> 00:09:57.720
We're selling you this sensor.

00:09:57.720 --> 00:09:59.370
It's going to go
in all your cars.

00:09:59.370 --> 00:10:04.740
And you do what you want to
do with it, but just be aware.

00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:07.440
And by doing that, have
absolved themselves

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:09.570
of any responsibility publicly.

00:10:09.570 --> 00:10:11.340
They are not the
corporation which

00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:14.520
is the one that
makes the headlines.

00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:16.350
Because from an
engineering perspective,

00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:18.270
they did the right thing.

00:10:18.270 --> 00:10:19.950
And they did the
commendable thing,

00:10:19.950 --> 00:10:22.860
and the protectable thing
in the eyes of the law

00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:27.070
by sending that one email
from that one engineer, which

00:10:27.070 --> 00:10:29.700
is really interesting.

00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:31.950
Because that's what
trust means and risks

00:10:31.950 --> 00:10:36.630
means within that area.

00:10:36.630 --> 00:10:39.360
Who knows where this is?

00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:41.990
Brownie points if you do.

00:10:41.990 --> 00:10:42.840
You can yell it out.

00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:52.800
Christchurch in New Zealand,
some years ago, obviously.

00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:55.860
And I always think of trust
and risk in an engineering

00:10:55.860 --> 00:10:58.590
space as this
space where we also

00:10:58.590 --> 00:11:03.960
are quite happy to bumble along
with crappy decision making

00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:08.550
and crappy structures of
living until something happens

00:11:08.550 --> 00:11:12.060
that makes us go, mm, I
guess that we'll build things

00:11:12.060 --> 00:11:17.640
in an earthquake safe manner
now, because the cost of change

00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:18.900
is high.

00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:21.000
The cost of taking
every single building

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.700
in New Zealand in both
islands and saying we're

00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:26.370
going to tear everything
down and we're

00:11:26.370 --> 00:11:30.240
going to rebuild it all to
code so that it's earthquake

00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:33.120
safe is not feasible.

00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:36.330
So we tend to wait till
bad things happen in order

00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:39.166
to operate any change.

00:11:39.166 --> 00:11:40.540
And this is because
we're people.

00:11:40.540 --> 00:11:41.260
We're human.

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:45.880
We assign a particular cost
to immediate decision making

00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:50.200
and we forget about the cost
of later decision making.

00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:53.290
We're very myopic that way.

00:11:56.230 --> 00:11:57.710
This is slightly more recent.

00:11:57.710 --> 00:12:01.390
Brownie points for who
knows where this is.

00:12:01.390 --> 00:12:02.240
Yes.

00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:04.690
So, Florida.

00:12:04.690 --> 00:12:07.570
Equally, here, the same
kind of conversation

00:12:07.570 --> 00:12:09.520
around risk and trust.

00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:11.560
Which is the engineer
called two days

00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:16.389
before to say, hey, by the
way, we've seen some cracks.

00:12:16.389 --> 00:12:17.680
You might want to look at this.

00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:19.420
This might need to be patched.

00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:21.850
And now this engineer is--

00:12:21.850 --> 00:12:25.270
his entire career is being
sort of dragged in the dirt

00:12:25.270 --> 00:12:28.430
because it turns out he was
involved in other projects.

00:12:28.430 --> 00:12:31.450
And oh, my god, what does this
mean for the other projects?

00:12:31.450 --> 00:12:33.190
As if that one
engineer was the one

00:12:33.190 --> 00:12:36.400
responsible for an
entire project like this.

00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:40.180
That no one else in the delivery
process, the people selling

00:12:40.180 --> 00:12:43.906
the concrete, the people
okaying the launch,

00:12:43.906 --> 00:12:45.280
whatever it might
be, no one else

00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:47.980
has any responsibility
but this one person.

00:12:51.370 --> 00:12:54.002
So we think about that in
terms of big structures.

00:12:54.002 --> 00:12:55.960
We're kind of happy
thinking about those things

00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:58.660
in terms of the structures
that surround us.

00:12:58.660 --> 00:13:00.980
But we're sort of less
comfortable with it,

00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:03.550
or it's newer to think
about it, in the things that

00:13:03.550 --> 00:13:06.730
start to disappear around
us, the small devices,

00:13:06.730 --> 00:13:09.550
the small consumer
facing devices.

00:13:09.550 --> 00:13:11.920
We don't yet have a
really good structure

00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:14.710
for what we should
expect, what risks looks

00:13:14.710 --> 00:13:17.320
like, what trust looks like.

00:13:20.780 --> 00:13:25.670
Or something as mundane and
as problematic as lifecycle.

00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:29.330
We live in a world where
things will not last very long.

00:13:29.330 --> 00:13:36.520
I am dragging my MacBook Pro
until it really literally dies

00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:38.170
on me, even though I'm--

00:13:38.170 --> 00:13:40.630
now, the nice people
next to me were probably

00:13:40.630 --> 00:13:43.330
thinking who is this
person, because I'm

00:13:43.330 --> 00:13:47.170
dragging an external keyboard,
because the keyboard died.

00:13:47.170 --> 00:13:49.470
And I'm like I am
not giving up on you,

00:13:49.470 --> 00:13:52.510
if you don't give up on me.

00:13:52.510 --> 00:13:55.990
Because I refused to
give said corporation

00:13:55.990 --> 00:13:58.360
that starts with an A
a large amount of money

00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:01.240
yet again every other year.

00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:03.700
And this one, this
baby, is like--

00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:05.210
I bought it in 2013.

00:14:05.210 --> 00:14:08.950
So I feel like I think we can
do another six months together,

00:14:08.950 --> 00:14:10.760
I swear.

00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:12.270
But lifecycle is a problem.

00:14:12.270 --> 00:14:14.300
It's a problem in
everyday devices.

00:14:14.300 --> 00:14:17.760
It's a problem in cheaper,
not even connected devices.

00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:20.650
But it's even more of a problem
in the internet of things.

00:14:23.510 --> 00:14:27.250
And because lifecycle has
become a problematic concept--

00:14:27.250 --> 00:14:30.980
so we have something like this,
which I own at home because,

00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:34.390
I, yes, drag books along
and external keyboards,

00:14:34.390 --> 00:14:38.280
but I also do try to buy
the latest and greatest.

00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:42.100
And this is an HP
smart ink printer.

00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:45.060
It is basically a printer
that I used to own

00:14:45.060 --> 00:14:49.260
and now I rent, because I
changed the process by which

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:51.750
ink is delivered to me.

00:14:51.750 --> 00:14:53.550
Which means that
now this printer--

00:14:53.550 --> 00:14:58.110
if my credit card or debit
card details change--

00:14:58.110 --> 00:15:01.060
stops printing,
because it does not

00:15:01.060 --> 00:15:04.300
recognize that the online
account is linked up

00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:05.200
to it anymore.

00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:09.790
And it gives me this really
weird message, like the printer

00:15:09.790 --> 00:15:12.110
can no longer function.

00:15:12.110 --> 00:15:13.420
It doesn't say why.

00:15:13.420 --> 00:15:16.900
It doesn't go, hey, maybe
you replaced your debit card

00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:20.020
and the billing kind
of process has changed.

00:15:20.020 --> 00:15:23.200
I can now no longer
interact with it

00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:25.600
until I change my
details online.

00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:28.930
Like that's a whole new
interaction with something

00:15:28.930 --> 00:15:31.480
that basically makes me want
to throw it in the garbage

00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:32.886
immediately.

00:15:32.886 --> 00:15:34.260
And it's already
a printer, which

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:38.080
is already the most
frustrating thing ever.

00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:40.875
Who here names their
printers after their pets?

00:15:44.430 --> 00:15:44.970
OK.

00:15:44.970 --> 00:15:45.600
Right.

00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:46.450
Two people.

00:15:46.450 --> 00:15:48.210
I think we've got something.

00:15:48.210 --> 00:15:51.840
I think we can start something.

00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:55.410
And the lifecycle of this is
really strange, because now--

00:15:55.410 --> 00:15:58.410
oh, five minutes,
wow-- these objects

00:15:58.410 --> 00:16:02.860
have started having a
life of their own somehow.

00:16:02.860 --> 00:16:05.070
So it's not even the
lifecycle of how I use it,

00:16:05.070 --> 00:16:06.915
it's how it decides to be used.

00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:14.980
We have, of course, more
problematic lifecycle issues

00:16:14.980 --> 00:16:16.960
that relate to--

00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:18.850
in the world of
IoT, companies that

00:16:18.850 --> 00:16:22.270
come and go far more
rapidly than most.

00:16:22.270 --> 00:16:24.660
And I'm kind of being
cheeky by picking Revolv--

00:16:24.660 --> 00:16:27.050
because, obviously,
I'm not an idiot.

00:16:27.050 --> 00:16:28.870
I know where I am.

00:16:28.870 --> 00:16:32.110
But there are multiple
others in my community

00:16:32.110 --> 00:16:35.790
that have come and gone in
the last two years or so.

00:16:35.790 --> 00:16:38.870
And when a consumer buys
something from someone,

00:16:38.870 --> 00:16:41.510
they don't necessarily think
at the back of their mind,

00:16:41.510 --> 00:16:44.100
I hope this company
is successful.

00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:47.090
I hope this company is
successful in two years.

00:16:47.090 --> 00:16:49.220
I hope that this
thing keeps working

00:16:49.220 --> 00:16:51.320
after this company dies.

00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:53.460
Nobody wants to think
that way, because it's

00:16:53.460 --> 00:16:58.430
sort of constantly thinking in
an early adopter kind of way.

00:16:58.430 --> 00:17:00.260
Not everybody has
that kind of money

00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:02.695
to throw constantly
at something.

00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:08.500
Within this group of
people in the IoT Mark,

00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:12.381
we talk about openness and what
open source can mean or not

00:17:12.381 --> 00:17:12.880
mean.

00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:14.869
And how could it be
used or not used?

00:17:14.869 --> 00:17:17.260
And who on earth wants
to open source everything

00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:19.630
and still be
commercially successful?

00:17:19.630 --> 00:17:22.520
These are all really
difficult questions.

00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:24.220
But openness might
mean that things

00:17:24.220 --> 00:17:27.369
start to be useful both
for us as households,

00:17:27.369 --> 00:17:29.740
and for the city,
and for researchers

00:17:29.740 --> 00:17:32.020
in much of a broad way.

00:17:32.020 --> 00:17:35.350
For example, if you
were using open data

00:17:35.350 --> 00:17:37.150
for a particular
consumer product--

00:17:37.150 --> 00:17:40.535
this is a crappy image, because
they still haven't got a better

00:17:40.535 --> 00:17:41.410
image on the website.

00:17:41.410 --> 00:17:43.870
But this is the air
quality egg, which

00:17:43.870 --> 00:17:46.840
is an air quality monitor
that you buy for your home.

00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:50.050
And it gives you your
air quality in your home.

00:17:50.050 --> 00:17:53.890
And you can see the map of all
the other air quality eggs.

00:17:53.890 --> 00:17:58.090
You sort of want that to be
connected to City University's

00:17:58.090 --> 00:18:02.290
projects, or UCL's projects,
so that UCL and City

00:18:02.290 --> 00:18:06.100
don't have to rebuild
another air quality monitor

00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:08.680
to do some air
quality monitoring

00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:12.270
and have to
commercially work out

00:18:12.270 --> 00:18:14.700
their own kind of
manufacturing hellhole.

00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:16.710
And you just want to
piggyback on what's

00:18:16.710 --> 00:18:17.720
there in people's homes.

00:18:20.780 --> 00:18:22.430
This is a company
called Nkube which

00:18:22.430 --> 00:18:25.310
is in the UK which
makes a smart hub.

00:18:25.310 --> 00:18:30.040
But it's a local smart
hub for your products.

00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:32.060
And it's made in
an open source way.

00:18:32.060 --> 00:18:35.380
But it's also made in a
way that is super secure.

00:18:35.380 --> 00:18:40.430
So openness does not
preclude security.

00:18:40.430 --> 00:18:41.900
Obviously, things
like Fairphone,

00:18:41.900 --> 00:18:45.770
which have to do with
openness and transparency.

00:18:45.770 --> 00:18:49.310
And they are two different
sections in our document.

00:18:49.310 --> 00:18:51.050
Don't worry.

00:18:51.050 --> 00:18:53.270
Permissions and ownership
being another one.

00:18:53.270 --> 00:18:57.290
I did not want to put Nest here,
again, for obvious reasons.

00:18:57.290 --> 00:19:00.110
I know where I am.

00:19:00.110 --> 00:19:03.620
But I bought a Hive at home.

00:19:03.620 --> 00:19:05.360
I installed a Hive at home.

00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:07.760
I am not one of the lucky
people who actually owns

00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:09.260
their own properties in the UK.

00:19:09.260 --> 00:19:10.340
I rent.

00:19:10.340 --> 00:19:11.830
So I moved.

00:19:11.830 --> 00:19:14.010
And when I moved, I
called British Gas.

00:19:14.010 --> 00:19:18.020
I said, can I have my Hive
with me in the next apartment?

00:19:18.020 --> 00:19:19.790
No, you can't.

00:19:19.790 --> 00:19:21.600
So I had to buy another one.

00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:24.680
I got 50 pounds discount
on the next one.

00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:27.860
But my online account is
still tied to the thing

00:19:27.860 --> 00:19:30.260
that's in the other apartment.

00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:32.930
And so I had to
create another account

00:19:32.930 --> 00:19:36.530
with another email
address to get the app

00:19:36.530 --> 00:19:38.780
to create a whole new profile.

00:19:38.780 --> 00:19:41.840
And the poor bastards
in the old flat

00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:45.590
are stuck with the thing
whose entire functionality--

00:19:45.590 --> 00:19:48.740
and the kind of plus of Hive is
the fact that I can switch it

00:19:48.740 --> 00:19:52.470
off with my phone online 20
minutes before I get home.

00:19:52.470 --> 00:19:57.410
And so I now hold ransom
their device somehow.

00:19:57.410 --> 00:19:59.240
Not, you know, literally.

00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:02.420
I haven't sent them anything.

00:20:02.420 --> 00:20:05.050
This is a friend of ours-- and
some of us in the room will

00:20:05.050 --> 00:20:07.310
know who that is--

00:20:07.310 --> 00:20:09.580
my friend Russell's wife, Anne.

00:20:09.580 --> 00:20:12.770
They used a Withings device.

00:20:12.770 --> 00:20:16.280
And that gives you a kind
of great way of interacting

00:20:16.280 --> 00:20:17.150
with your weight.

00:20:17.150 --> 00:20:19.520
And you can chart kind
of how you're doing

00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:23.750
and with your exercise,
et cetera, except when

00:20:23.750 --> 00:20:26.120
your weight and your
husband's weight

00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:29.210
start to get a little too close.

00:20:29.210 --> 00:20:32.960
And the device says,
hi, Russell, when

00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:36.050
it's actually her and not him.

00:20:36.050 --> 00:20:37.380
Time is up, wow.

00:20:37.380 --> 00:20:38.330
Right.

00:20:38.330 --> 00:20:41.800
So, all these are
considerations.

00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:45.670
And I will skip through
these in like 5 seconds.

00:20:45.670 --> 00:20:48.370
Here's some security
stuff in the 33 principles

00:20:48.370 --> 00:20:49.930
that we have published.

00:20:49.930 --> 00:20:53.090
We have eight categories
which we are using.

00:20:53.090 --> 00:20:56.120
We are also working in a
completely open process.

00:20:56.120 --> 00:21:00.060
So we do have GitHub things.

00:21:00.060 --> 00:21:02.860
And we have open tools, which
we have literally just produced

00:21:02.860 --> 00:21:05.800
in the last 24 hours, because
I gave a talk last night

00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:08.100
at the meetup.

00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:10.290
And I would, again,
love, love, love

00:21:10.290 --> 00:21:11.930
to get your feedback
on all of this.

00:21:11.930 --> 00:21:14.670
We're not the only people
doing stuff around this space.

00:21:14.670 --> 00:21:17.070
These are 45 of the
other things that

00:21:17.070 --> 00:21:20.070
are happening around the world
that touch this space that

00:21:20.070 --> 00:21:21.900
are concerned with this space.

00:21:21.900 --> 00:21:24.090
They are policy papers.

00:21:24.090 --> 00:21:25.560
They're policy efforts.

00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:26.730
They are white papers.

00:21:26.730 --> 00:21:30.120
I mean we're part of a
global movement right now.

00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:32.866
But I think that we need
more responsibility.

00:21:32.866 --> 00:21:35.531
Top props for who
knows what this is?

00:21:35.531 --> 00:21:36.030
Yes.

00:21:36.030 --> 00:21:37.030
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:21:37.030 --> 00:21:37.890
ALEXANDRA DESCHAMPS-SONSINO:
Yeah, yeah.

00:21:37.890 --> 00:21:39.720
So the iron ring, in which--

00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:42.210
if you're Canadian like myself,
my brother is an engineer

00:21:42.210 --> 00:21:43.800
and has this ring.

00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:48.030
It is a physical reminder
of your ethical requirements

00:21:48.030 --> 00:21:50.450
as a professional.

00:21:50.450 --> 00:21:52.730
And we have also lots
of other frameworks that

00:21:52.730 --> 00:21:54.320
have been created
by people long,

00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:57.410
long ago dead who are awesome.

00:21:57.410 --> 00:22:00.380
Marshall McLuhan's "Global
Village," which I have as one

00:22:00.380 --> 00:22:04.850
of my lending books today,
which I really recommend.

00:22:04.850 --> 00:22:07.010
The other one, which
is Neil Postman's

00:22:07.010 --> 00:22:08.900
"Seven Questions
for Technology,"

00:22:08.900 --> 00:22:11.810
which I also recommend,
they are like decades old.

00:22:11.810 --> 00:22:13.790
And they're still
really useful frameworks

00:22:13.790 --> 00:22:17.210
for asking ourselves questions.

00:22:17.210 --> 00:22:19.130
And asking ourselves
questions really

00:22:19.130 --> 00:22:22.790
about what the role
of computing is.

00:22:22.790 --> 00:22:26.480
Really, really top marks
for who knows who said this.

00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:27.700
And that is my last slide.

00:22:27.700 --> 00:22:29.930
You'll be happy to
know [INAUDIBLE]..

00:22:29.930 --> 00:22:31.790
"What the coming of
the computer did,

00:22:31.790 --> 00:22:34.580
'just in time,' was to make it
unnecessary to create social

00:22:34.580 --> 00:22:37.700
inventions to change
the system in any way.

00:22:37.700 --> 00:22:41.300
So in that sense, the computer
has acted fundamentally

00:22:41.300 --> 00:22:44.560
as a conservative force."

00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:46.340
Is the creator of
artificial intelligence

00:22:46.340 --> 00:22:48.380
himself saying this?

00:22:48.380 --> 00:22:49.460
I leave you with this.

00:22:49.460 --> 00:22:52.610
I thank you for your
time, and your attention,

00:22:52.610 --> 00:22:55.350
and hope that we can have
some conversations after.

00:22:55.350 --> 00:22:56.167
Thank you.

00:22:56.167 --> 00:22:58.652
[APPLAUSE]

00:23:02.131 --> 00:23:04.616
SPEAKER 2: We have a
little time for questions.

00:23:04.616 --> 00:23:05.858
Yeah.

00:23:05.858 --> 00:23:08.592
AUDIENCE: Hey, there.

00:23:08.592 --> 00:23:09.586
SPEAKER 2: Anybody?

00:23:14.556 --> 00:23:15.550
I have one.

00:23:18.540 --> 00:23:19.221
Oh, no?

00:23:19.221 --> 00:23:19.720
OK.

00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:21.861
Aha.

00:23:21.861 --> 00:23:23.610
AUDIENCE: I'm just
perusing the principles

00:23:23.610 --> 00:23:25.670
and they look really good.

00:23:25.670 --> 00:23:28.220
I guess what's the
go-to market strategy,

00:23:28.220 --> 00:23:31.220
I mean, in terms of getting
these actually to be used?

00:23:31.220 --> 00:23:33.485
Do you think it works
better to sort of legislate?

00:23:33.485 --> 00:23:35.360
Does it work better
through market pressures?

00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:36.920
Do you think you
the Fair Trade label

00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:38.740
strategy is going to work?

00:23:38.740 --> 00:23:40.220
But Fair Trade's
premium, you know?

00:23:40.220 --> 00:23:41.774
That doesn't apply
across the board.

00:23:41.774 --> 00:23:43.940
So in a sense, I would want
some of those principles

00:23:43.940 --> 00:23:46.610
to be used by everyone, not just
by the small sort of Fair Trade

00:23:46.610 --> 00:23:47.500
subset.

00:23:47.500 --> 00:23:48.916
ALEXANDRA
DESCHAMPS-SONSINO: Sure.

00:23:48.916 --> 00:23:52.470
And-- the question
was about whether this

00:23:52.470 --> 00:23:55.410
is a premium thing.

00:23:55.410 --> 00:23:57.990
The certification
mark kind of model

00:23:57.990 --> 00:24:02.040
is the one that we have
come to a conclusion about,

00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:05.472
after lots of chats
with lots of lawyers.

00:24:05.472 --> 00:24:06.930
They're always an
interesting group

00:24:06.930 --> 00:24:10.800
of people to talk to
about implementability,

00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:15.239
but also appetite for
trusted implementation.

00:24:15.239 --> 00:24:17.280
So you can tell people
what they should be doing.

00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:18.821
And they can tell
you, yes, that they

00:24:18.821 --> 00:24:21.720
do do in a self-certified
kind of way.

00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:23.820
There is nothing to
prove that they do.

00:24:23.820 --> 00:24:25.650
And that's a problem for us.

00:24:25.650 --> 00:24:28.080
Those other models which we
were exploring, one of which

00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:31.360
is closer to something like
the Energy Star rating,

00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:35.700
which is where you are
basically enabling anyone,

00:24:35.700 --> 00:24:39.547
no matter how bad they
are, to be clear about what

00:24:39.547 --> 00:24:40.630
it is that they are doing.

00:24:40.630 --> 00:24:43.920
The little that they might
be doing, you're championing.

00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:45.660
So we're definitely
in conversations

00:24:45.660 --> 00:24:49.110
around which implementation of
this mark might be the best.

00:24:49.110 --> 00:24:52.270
Again, if you have
thoughts and opinions,

00:24:52.270 --> 00:24:57.690
we have a very active Slack
channel, and the usual means.

00:24:57.690 --> 00:24:59.610
We have open calls every month.

00:24:59.610 --> 00:25:01.410
We have newsletters.

00:25:01.410 --> 00:25:03.600
We have face-to-face meetings.

00:25:03.600 --> 00:25:04.980
So we'd love your feedback.

00:25:12.010 --> 00:25:14.090
SPEAKER 1: There are
no-- you had a question--

00:25:14.090 --> 00:25:16.215
SPEAKER 2: I'll surrender
my question to the floor.

00:25:18.550 --> 00:25:21.810
AUDIENCE: So I just wanted
clarification about the sensor

00:25:21.810 --> 00:25:24.100
in the VW diesel problem.

00:25:24.100 --> 00:25:27.910
You seem to be implying that
the sensor suppliers had

00:25:27.910 --> 00:25:30.642
some responsibility
in the scandal.

00:25:30.642 --> 00:25:32.100
But was that really
what you meant?

00:25:32.100 --> 00:25:34.907
And if that's true, how about
all the other suppliers?

00:25:34.907 --> 00:25:36.490
ALEXANDRA
DESCHAMPS-SONSINO: Oh, sure.

00:25:36.490 --> 00:25:38.230
But I mean the sensor
is the one that

00:25:38.230 --> 00:25:40.890
actually is the most active
in enabling a rating.

00:25:40.890 --> 00:25:41.870
AUDIENCE: Wouldn't
the software be that?

00:25:41.870 --> 00:25:42.500
ALEXANDRA
DESCHAMPS-SONSINO: Sorry?

00:25:42.500 --> 00:25:44.290
AUDIENCE: Can the
software be that?

00:25:44.290 --> 00:25:44.530
ALEXANDRA
DESCHAMPS-SONSINO: Yeah.

00:25:44.530 --> 00:25:46.500
But without the--
it's a little bit--

00:25:46.500 --> 00:25:48.490
so the funny thing
about software

00:25:48.490 --> 00:25:50.800
only is that ultimately
there is a thing that

00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:52.640
needs to measure something.

00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:57.580
So the buck stops with hardware
in some IoT applications.

00:25:57.580 --> 00:26:01.290
Without power to a sensor,
you can't measure anything.

00:26:01.290 --> 00:26:04.340
Therefore, you got no
data and no one owns it.

00:26:04.340 --> 00:26:09.700
So there is a responsibility
that they share.

00:26:09.700 --> 00:26:14.170
Their way of turning away
from that responsibility

00:26:14.170 --> 00:26:16.480
is this email that
the engineer sent out

00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:20.860
to say, oh, by the way,
we're doing the hardware bit.

00:26:20.860 --> 00:26:21.942
You guys were going--

00:26:21.942 --> 00:26:23.650
AUDIENCE: My real
question is, how do you

00:26:23.650 --> 00:26:27.340
come to that sort of
causal blame analysis?

00:26:27.340 --> 00:26:30.550
Because gun manufacturers
get their materials

00:26:30.550 --> 00:26:31.330
from steel makers.

00:26:31.330 --> 00:26:35.500
Do they also adhere to this sort
of causal blame responsibility

00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:36.164
here?

00:26:36.164 --> 00:26:37.580
ALEXANDRA
DESCHAMPS-SONSINO: There

00:26:37.580 --> 00:26:41.890
are liability issues
across supply chains

00:26:41.890 --> 00:26:44.660
and across manufacturers
everywhere.

00:26:44.660 --> 00:26:49.150
And you trust your suppliers
to tick certain boxes,

00:26:49.150 --> 00:26:51.590
whether that's standards boxes.

00:26:51.590 --> 00:26:55.720
So I'm not going to be supplied
with the quality of plastic

00:26:55.720 --> 00:26:59.440
that might include some lead
if I make my toy out of it.

00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:03.700
There is trust and
legal frameworks

00:27:03.700 --> 00:27:05.920
built into every supply chain.

00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:08.290
We don't quite have
that connection

00:27:08.290 --> 00:27:11.330
between this hardware
and software space.

00:27:11.330 --> 00:27:14.140
And so a lot of the
projects that I showed--

00:27:14.140 --> 00:27:16.600
the 45 different projects
that are around the world--

00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:20.920
a lot of them now are
concentrating on security,

00:27:20.920 --> 00:27:23.920
because they feel like
that's an easier box

00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:28.390
to tick than to look more
transversely at ownership,

00:27:28.390 --> 00:27:30.640
permissions,
openness, et cetera.

00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:34.060
Because it is about
that complex connection

00:27:34.060 --> 00:27:38.500
and back to that quote from
Buckminster Fuller, which

00:27:38.500 --> 00:27:43.090
is the movement of each element
has unintended consequences

00:27:43.090 --> 00:27:44.660
at a larger scale.

00:27:44.660 --> 00:27:47.140
So that's kind of
why we're choosing

00:27:47.140 --> 00:27:50.200
to pick minimum viable
everything on lots

00:27:50.200 --> 00:27:53.710
of different levels,
because I don't think

00:27:53.710 --> 00:27:58.420
it's future proof to
think in this siloed way

00:27:58.420 --> 00:28:02.120
that, well, you know, my
responsibility lies here.

00:28:02.120 --> 00:28:03.985
No, you're still making
a car that pollutes.

00:28:06.915 --> 00:28:07.790
SPEAKER 2: All right.

00:28:07.790 --> 00:28:08.340
Thank you.

00:28:08.340 --> 00:28:12.170
[APPLAUSE]

00:28:12.170 --> 00:28:13.930
SPEAKER 1: The next speaker--

00:28:13.930 --> 00:28:17.430
I'm sure I'm not pronouncing
name correctly, Haiyan.
