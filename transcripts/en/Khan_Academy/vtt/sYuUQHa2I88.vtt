00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:01.610
- [Instructor] Now a related idea to

00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:04.670
just what a bureaucracy is
in our federal government.

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:07.620
Another question is how
do they get influenced?

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:10.150
Now one idea that you might see

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:12.160
in many American government courses

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.130
is the idea of an iron triangle.

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:20.130
So an iron triangle describes
how various parties might

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.210
influence each other and what
they might do for each other.

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:26.220
So let's say that there is a group

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.890
that is very interested
in building more roads.

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:31.750
Maybe there's a group that represents

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:34.750
all the road contractors
in the United States,

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:37.130
and they would love more
highways to be built

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:39.570
because there'd be more business for them.

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.270
And so then that interest group,

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:44.130
who wants more highways to
be built, they might say,

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:48.080
hey, congresspeople, we
want more highways built.

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:51.290
The way that they try to
get favor with Congress

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:53.380
is through electoral support.

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:55.710
Now what kind of electoral
support could they give?

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.950
Well, they could donate money
to the congressmen directly.

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:02.430
They could donate money
to political parties.

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.420
They could try to activate the electorate

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:07.750
to vote for a congressperson

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:11.030
who favors their agenda
more than someone else.

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.130
In exchange, congresspeople
could do a few things.

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.150
They could provide more
funding to the bureaucracy

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:18.840
that is going to build roads,

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:19.860
and we just talked about that

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.212
bureaucracy in the executive branch.

00:01:22.212 --> 00:01:25.200
That bureaucracy, not only
might they build more roads,

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.750
but if they like those interest groups,

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.160
they might lower their
regulations on them.

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:30.890
They might give them more contracts

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:32.800
as they build those roads.

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.470
Another thing that Congress could do

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.130
for the interest group is
pass friendly legislation.

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.590
So maybe pass a law that
makes it easier to build roads

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:45.320
in a certain part of the
country or in a certain way.

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.640
But the reason why it's
called an iron triangle,

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.120
it's not just about what
do interest groups want.

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:51.940
It's also what does Congress want?

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:53.100
What does the bureaucracy want,

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.400
and what do they get from
the other two parties?

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.310
So we already talked about how Congress

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:59.930
can get electoral support
from interest groups,

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:02.040
but what can it get from a bureaucracy?

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.230
Congress passes laws and a budget,

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:05.930
but a bureaucracy, for the most part,

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:07.870
decides how to execute on that.

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:11.340
And so if they are aligned with Congress,

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.800
they might execute on those laws

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.170
with a little bit more energy.

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.770
If the bureaucracy, for
one reason or another,

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:18.760
is not as gung ho about those laws,

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.810
they might drag their feet a little bit.

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:22.880
And from the bureaucracy point of view?

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:24.310
Well, we already talked
about how they could get

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.350
funding and political
support from Congress.

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:29.330
You see that on that part
of the triangle there.

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.120
What do they get from the interest groups?

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.340
Well, we already talked about
the congressional support,

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.790
which they can do by
supporting congresspeople

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.650
who might support favorable
policies for the bureaucracy.

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:39.840
The interest groups might be able to

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.720
directly lobby Congress, which means,

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.310
hey, we're going to meet with Congress.

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:47.870
We might even draft some
things for the policy agenda.

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:51.470
Now a related idea to an iron
triangle in interest groups

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:54.390
that you might also hear in
an American government course

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:59.290
is the notion of issue networks.

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:02.410
One way to think about
issue networks is they are

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:05.560
essentially more informal
than interest groups.

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.070
Interest groups can be
part of an issue network,

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:09.890
but an issue network can be, let's say,

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:11.830
you and I start to get really activated

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:13.130
about something we get on TV,

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:15.140
and then we start mailing
our congresspeople,

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:16.490
and we start blogging about it,

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:18.070
and we start getting a following,

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:20.540
and then that starts to
influence an interest group.

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:21.870
Or an interest group joins with us,

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:25.260
and then we start to send
messages to Congress.

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:29.110
We start to provide more
scrutiny on the bureaucracy.

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:31.470
Then we would be an issue network,

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.960
and as I mentioned, issue
networks might not be formal.

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:35.260
They might not be a formal, let's say,

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.920
lobbying group or interest group,

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.710
but they can also have
influence in the same way

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:42.270
that an interest group does.
