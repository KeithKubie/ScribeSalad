00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.879
You’ve all probably heard or stumbled over
the famous tongue twister...

00:00:03.879 --> 00:00:07.600
Sea shells... no.
she sells she's... oh.

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:10.010
She sells seashells by the seashore.

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:11.640
She sells seashells by the seashore.

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:12.640
She shells...

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:13.640
You get it.

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:18.189
Those six words tell a little known story
about the early days of paleontology and one

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:22.349
of its most important and influential participants;
Mary Anning.

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:26.510
But, first, let’s start here, with “the
seashore.”

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:31.510
This seashore is actually a 95 mile stretch
of shoreline in Dorset County, UK, that is

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:34.270
impressively nicknamed The Jurassic Coast.

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:41.120
It’s the only place in the world that shows
a complete 185 million year slice of history

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.850
as seen in the layers of its towering cliffs.

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:48.330
The rocks and beaches are full of fossils
and remains not only from the Jurassic, but

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:50.490
also the Triassic and Cretaceous.

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:55.960
And it was here, in the early 19th century,
where we started to realize that not only

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:01.760
was there such a thing as “millions of years
ago,” but that once upon a time… there

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.700
were such things as dinosaurs.

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:09.899
And one of the people who helped us figure
this out is the “she” in this tongue twister.

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:14.530
Mary Anning was born and raised in the Dorset
area, and from an early age she collected

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:17.929
and sold fossils, that, yes, were kind of
like seashells.

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:22.670
After her father died when Mary was just 10
years old, she continued to help support her

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:27.790
family by finding, identifying and selling
fossils to collectors and tourists.

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:32.229
But in doing so, she started finding things
that changed the way we look at the history

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:33.350
of our planet.

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:38.369
Before the age of 13, Mary unearthed one of
the first ichthyosaur skeletons ever discovered.

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:43.470
She also found the first complete plesiosaur,
the first pterosaur found outside of Germany,

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.899
and helped first identify fossilized dino
poop which is now called coprolite.

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:51.960
A lot of these discoveries made people question
the world they knew.

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:59.240
It gave rise to the idea of extinctions; these
giant reptiles obviously existed at one time,

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:00.520
but now don’t.

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.499
That was a new concept.

00:02:02.499 --> 00:02:07.270
Basically, because of what she found and how
that influenced our understanding of science,

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:13.180
it’s safe to say that Mary is one of history’s
best and most important fossil hunters.

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:18.930
But, even though Mary Anning was one the great
science minds of her time, she faced a lot

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:24.940
of challenges as a woman in the 19th century
who was not affluent nor formally educated.

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:29.310
She was embraced by many members of the science
community, including prominent professors,

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:34.290
lecturers, geologists, naturalists, paleontologists
and anatomists, but was still left on the

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:35.640
outside looking in.

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.970
Women were not allowed to attend university,
join many prominent science organizations,

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:41.370
hold office or vote.

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:46.909
So, it comes as no surprise that she was never
able to publish her findings and was not always

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:49.620
properly credited with her discoveries.

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.629
And without proper documentation, history
has a tendency to forget.

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:56.930
Which is why, today, one of the only ways
people around the world are familiar with

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:02.140
Mary Anning and her work is a tongue twister
that just doesn’t tell the whole story.

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:07.900
So maybe instead we should be teaching our
children about Mary, voted one of the 10 most

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:11.939
important British woman scientists of all
time, by saying this three times fast:

00:03:11.939 --> 00:03:14.860
Anning unearths ichthyosaurs on the Dorset
coast.

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:16.799
Anning unearths ichthyosaurs on the Dorset
coast.

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:18.940
Anning unearths ichthyosaurs...

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:19.940
You get it.

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:23.110
If you're not yet over dinosaurs, you should
watch this video right here, because some

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:27.440
nerds made a tiny tweak to the dino family
tree, and upheaval happened.

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:29.219
Again, video, watch it.

00:03:29.219 --> 00:03:31.440
Do you think there are other scientists that
need more credit?

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.870
Let us know down in the comments, make sure
you subscribe for more Seeker, and thanks

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:35.370
for watching.
