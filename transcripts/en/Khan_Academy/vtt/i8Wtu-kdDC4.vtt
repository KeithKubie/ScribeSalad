00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:03.780
This next optimization problem
that I've been sent seems fun.

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.350
I've actually never seen this
problem before, and so I'm

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:09.170
even more excited to do it.

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:12.620
So it says, a wire of
length 100 centimeters

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:14.470
is cut into two pieces.

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:16.115
Let me draw this wire.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.450
So that's our wire, and it's
going to be cut into 2 pieces.

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:25.200
Let me read the whole thing
before I draw anything.

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.760
One is bent to form a square,
and the other is bent to form

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:30.640
an equilateral triangle.

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.400
Where should the cut be made if
A, the sum of the two areas is

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.530
to be a minimum or a maximum?

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:39.610
And it says, allow the
possibility of no cut.

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:40.910
Fascinating.

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:43.870
So this is a 100
centimeters long.

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:45.440
Doesn't matter if it's
centimeters or meters

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:46.730
or whatever, right?

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:49.230
So it's 100 long.

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.540
Could be 100 miles long.

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:54.630
And we're going to cut
it at some point.

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:56.130
We'll cut it there.

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:00.510
Well, I shouldn't have
done that, because I was

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.205
going to use x and y.

00:01:02.205 --> 00:01:04.330
But actually, let's use a
and b, since I made the

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:05.500
cut look like an x.

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.575
So let's say that that is a
centimeters from the left

00:01:08.575 --> 00:01:10.630
hand side of the wire.

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:12.990
And then what is the distance
from the right hand

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:13.530
side of the wire?

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.420
I could call it b, but even
easier would be to say, if

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:18.760
this is a, then this is
going to be 100 minus a.

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.620
And they say, I'm going to take
one of the wires, let me just

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:30.150
say the left hand wire, and I'm
going to take it into, and

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.550
I'm going to form a square.

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:32.870
Which is not a rectangle.

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:33.610
A square.

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:36.900
And then the other wire
is going to form an

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.150
equilateral triangle.

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:40.610
OK.

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:41.090
So let's do it.

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:43.620
And actually, I can already
sense that it'll be easier

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:46.240
to manipulate this one.

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:47.850
So I'm going to make the
equilateral triangle out of

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.290
this side, and make the square
out of the side, just because I

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:52.800
have a sense it will make
the math a little easier.

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.690
So I'm going to take this wire
of length a and form an

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:57.800
equilateral triangle
out of it, right?

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.790
What is the triangle
going to look like?

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.780
It's going to look like, and
I'm going to arbitrarily

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.090
switch colors now.

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.720
So this is my
equilateral triangle.

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.500
All the sides are equal.

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.840
And how long are each of
the sides going to be?

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.810
Well, the whole perimeter
is a, so each of

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:16.690
these have to be a/3.

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.175
And then I also have a
square with the leftovers.

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.250
I'm not using the the square
tool-- so I have it,

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:39.780
I should use it.

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.020
Oh, I don't want to
do it like that.

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.670
OK, so there's my square.

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:49.320
And if the whole perimeter
is 100 minus a, what is

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:50.380
the length of each side?

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:53.780
It's going to be this
divided by 4, right?

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:56.630
Because all the
sides are equal.

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:59.590
So what's this length
divided by 4?

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:05.190
100 minus a divided by 4
is 25 minus a/4, right?

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:13.430
So this side is 25 minus a/4,
this side is 25 minus a/4, and

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:17.340
this is the same thing, 25
minus a/4, and this

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.180
is 25 minus a/4.

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:24.990
And they want us to find what
value of a, they say, the

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:26.550
sum of the 2 areas, right?

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:34.870
They want to know what value of
a minimizes the sum of the 2

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:37.785
areas and maximize the
sum of the 2 areas.

00:03:37.785 --> 00:03:39.330
So what are the sum
of the 2 areas?

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:40.380
What's the are of
this triangle?

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:43.440
I always forget the formula for
the area of an equilateral

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.460
triangle, so we'll have to
kind of derive it right now.

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:50.300
So what I do, is I always draw
something like that, and then

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:52.110
we know that this length
right here is a/6.

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:57.700
I'm just doing the
halfway point.

00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:59.230
The whole thing is a/3.

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:01.550
And this is a 30-60-90
triangle, right?

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:04.520
That's 30, this is 60, so
this is going to be square

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:05.700
root of 3 times this.

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:08.120
So the height, let me do
that here, just so you

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.700
know what I'm doing.

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:12.750
This is a some geometry I'm
drawing half the triangle.

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:14.990
This would be a/6.

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:17.960
That's a/3.

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:27.180
And so this would be square
root of 3 times this.

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:34.890
So square root of
3 over 6 times a.

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:36.370
So what's the area?

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:41.540
Well, the area of this half
triangle, is base times

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:43.730
height times 1/2.

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:45.370
So the area of the whole
triangle is just going to be

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:48.150
this base times this height.

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:55.530
So the area of the triangle
is equal to this base

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:57.050
times that height.

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:03.200
So its area over 6, that's
this, times the height, times

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:07.370
square root of 3 over 6, area.

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:09.690
And just so you remember,
area of a triangle is

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:11.390
1/2 base times height.

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:14.220
So if we did 1/2 base times
height, we would get the area

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:15.740
of this triangle, right?

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:17.590
But the area of the
entire triangle is 2

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:18.770
of these triangles.

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:20.890
And so that's why I
got rid of the 1/2.

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:24.450
Because it's 2 times
1/2 base times height.

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:25.660
Hopefully that
doesn't confuse you.

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:27.520
It's just a little
bit of geometry.

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:33.920
Anyway, the area of the
triangle is equal to the square

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:38.270
root of 3 over 36 a squared.

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:40.190
And what's the area
of the square?

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:41.380
That's easier.

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:43.250
That's just base times height.

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:49.510
So area of the square is
equal to 25 minus a over

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:54.740
4, that's just base
times height, squared.

00:05:54.740 --> 00:06:03.370
And that is equal to 625
minus 2 times-- so it's

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:09.020
20, let's see, 25 over
4 minus 50 over 4 a?

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:09.360
Right.

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:20.240
Minus 50 over 4a, plus
a squared over 16.

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:22.070
So that's the area
of the square.

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:27.080
But we want to know the
combined area of both of them.

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:29.470
So what's the function
for the combined area?

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:34.150
So the combined area, and I'll
do it in a bold color, area of

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:36.300
both of them, I'll say area
combined, that's equal to

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:38.750
the area of the square plus
the area of the triangle.

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:45.060
So the area of the
square is, let's see.

00:06:45.060 --> 00:07:01.050
It's a squared over 16 minus 50
over 4 a plus 625, and we want

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:07.450
to add the area of the
triangle, plus square root

00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:11.570
of 3 over 36 a squared.

00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:13.570
And that's a function of a.

00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:15.260
We could it put it like that.

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:16.800
So now we have to optimize it.

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:19.930
And we want to find the
minimum point and the maximum

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:21.310
point, if they exist.

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:23.315
Let me clear up some space.

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:31.970
The area of the square is
already implicitly there.

00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:37.940
I could actually clear
up all of this here.

00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:41.910
And so what is the derivative?

00:07:41.910 --> 00:07:46.670
a prime, the combined--
actually, I hope you

00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:47.960
don't mind, I'm going
to erase that too.

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:49.630
Because I think I'm going to
run out of space and just get

00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:52.110
all bunched up, otherwise.

00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:54.246
That's not what I wanted to do.

00:07:54.246 --> 00:07:56.520
But you know we're
talking about.

00:07:56.520 --> 00:08:00.930
We already have figured out the
area the combined entities.

00:08:00.930 --> 00:08:02.410
So now it's just pure calculus.

00:08:02.410 --> 00:08:04.740
All the geometry is done.

00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:11.680
So what is the derivative of
the combined areas as a

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:15.530
function of a is equal to the
derivative of this expression?

00:08:15.530 --> 00:08:22.920
So it's 2 times 16,
2/16, so it's a over 8.

00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:25.560
So let me write this.

00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:29.780
a over 8, let me draw a
line here, I don't want

00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:31.480
things to get confused.

00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:42.240
a over 8 minus 50/4, this
derivative 625 is just zero,

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:52.450
plus 2 over square root
of 3 over 18 a, right?

00:08:52.450 --> 00:08:55.030
And so we want to find the
minimum, or the maximum,

00:08:55.030 --> 00:08:56.300
values for this.

00:08:56.300 --> 00:09:01.860
So let's set this
equation as equal to 0.

00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:06.600
So we get, let me
see what we can do.

00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:08.170
We could add the
a coefficients.

00:09:08.170 --> 00:09:19.216
So we have 1/8 plus square root
of 3 over 18 a, right, I just

00:09:19.216 --> 00:09:22.890
added that to that, minus 50/4.

00:09:22.890 --> 00:09:25.420
And we want to set this
derivative equal to zero.

00:09:25.420 --> 00:09:27.880
So let me switch
colors arbitrarily.

00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:32.600
And so we get, let me add these
two fractions, so 8 and 18.

00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:35.350
What's their common
denominator?

00:09:35.350 --> 00:09:36.420
8 and 9.

00:09:39.350 --> 00:09:40.520
8 times 9, is it 72?

00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:49.120
And 1/8 is the same
thing as 9/72.

00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:58.810
And so 18 goes into 72 4 times,
so that's plus 4 square roots

00:09:58.810 --> 00:10:07.370
of 3, and all that times
a is equal to 50/4.

00:10:07.370 --> 00:10:09.740
And now we can multiply both
sides times the reciprocal of

00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:15.300
this coefficient, and we get--
maybe I made a careless

00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:17.650
mistake, but the numbers
aren't coming out too clean.

00:10:17.650 --> 00:10:19.210
But maybe they're not meant to.

00:10:19.210 --> 00:10:30.770
a is equal to 50/4
times 72 over 9 plus

00:10:30.770 --> 00:10:33.650
4 square roots of 3.

00:10:33.650 --> 00:10:35.360
Let's see if we can
cancel anything out.

00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:43.380
This 4 becomes, this becomes an
18, and so we get a is equal

00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:54.950
to 50 times 18 divided by 9
plus 4 square roots of 3.

00:10:54.950 --> 00:10:58.870
Now let's see if that
makes any kind of sense.

00:10:58.870 --> 00:10:59.980
And I think I'm going
to have to get the

00:10:59.980 --> 00:11:01.080
calculator for this one.

00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:09.910
So what should I do first?

00:11:09.910 --> 00:11:12.380
Let me figure out what the
denominator's value is.

00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:26.070
so 3 square root times 4 equals
plus 9 is equal to 15.928.

00:11:26.070 --> 00:11:31.030
So that a is equal to,
what's 50 times 18,

00:11:31.030 --> 00:11:34.560
550, 50, 90, right?

00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:36.270
5 times 8 is 40, right?

00:11:36.270 --> 00:11:45.090
So that's 900 over 15.928,
so let me do that, let

00:11:45.090 --> 00:11:48.990
me just invert that.

00:11:48.990 --> 00:11:56.420
Times 900.

00:11:56.420 --> 00:12:00.660
It equals 56.5.

00:12:00.660 --> 00:12:05.690
So a is equal to 56.5.

00:12:05.690 --> 00:12:08.040
So at least we got a
number that makes sense.

00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:12.070
It would have been unfortunate
if the point that we have to

00:12:12.070 --> 00:12:17.440
cut this wire was some number
larger, or God forbid we had

00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:18.480
a negative number there.

00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:20.600
But we actually got a positive
number, and it's a number

00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:22.640
between 0 and 100.

00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:25.060
So we are probably right.

00:12:25.060 --> 00:12:28.460
But the question is, is this
a minimum value, or is

00:12:28.460 --> 00:12:30.060
this a maximum value?

00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:32.550
And to figure that out, well,
let's see if we're concave

00:12:32.550 --> 00:12:35.160
upwards or downwards
at this point.

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:36.470
So let's think about it.

00:12:36.470 --> 00:12:38.860
Let's take the second
derivative of our

00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:41.230
combined area function.

00:12:41.230 --> 00:12:46.600
So this was our combined
area function.

00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:47.660
We had set it equal to 0.

00:12:47.660 --> 00:12:49.840
Let's take the second
derivative of that.

00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:55.830
Well that just equals, the
derivative of this equals, 1/8

00:12:55.830 --> 00:13:01.840
plus square root of 3 over 18,
well, times a, but that

00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:02.560
just [? switches ?]

00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:03.950
coefficient, and then
that goes to 0.

00:13:03.950 --> 00:13:09.890
So that equals a prime
prime as a function of a.

00:13:09.890 --> 00:13:11.540
The combined areas
are a function of a.

00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:14.620
It's just a constant number,
and it is a positive

00:13:14.620 --> 00:13:15.660
constant number.

00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:18.290
So what does that tell us,
given that that is a positive

00:13:18.290 --> 00:13:22.790
constant Number That tells us
that at any value of a, the

00:13:22.790 --> 00:13:24.870
second derivative is positive.

00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:28.680
The second derivative is
positive tells us that we are

00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:34.400
concave upwards, really over
this whole combined

00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:36.960
area function, we're
concave upwards.

00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:37.610
And how do we know that?

00:13:37.610 --> 00:13:38.170
Well, the [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:13:38.170 --> 00:13:41.610
is positive, the slope is
always increasing, right?

00:13:41.610 --> 00:13:45.900
And that tells us that any
value where the slope a 0,

00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:49.230
which was this one, is
actually a minimum point.

00:13:51.860 --> 00:13:53.790
So a is equal to 56.5.

00:13:53.790 --> 00:13:59.930
So if we cut it at 56.5, we are
actually at a minimum point.

00:13:59.930 --> 00:14:03.270
So how would we maximize
the combined value?

00:14:03.270 --> 00:14:05.130
Well, maybe here, we have
to just take one of the

00:14:05.130 --> 00:14:06.440
boundary conditions.

00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:10.380
So maybe we could set a as
equal to 0, or we could set a

00:14:10.380 --> 00:14:13.960
as equal to 100, and figure out
what the values are, and one

00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:16.620
of those have to be
our maximum value.

00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:19.470
So what happens when
a is equal to zero?

00:14:22.420 --> 00:14:25.110
So this was our function
to begin with.

00:14:25.110 --> 00:14:30.630
What is our combined area
function, if a is 0?

00:14:30.630 --> 00:14:39.520
Well, this is 0, this is 0,
that is 0, so it equals 625.

00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:41.280
And what does that
translate into?

00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:44.490
That's the case where the
entire wire is used to make a

00:14:44.490 --> 00:14:47.660
square, and none of the wire
is used to make a triangle.

00:14:47.660 --> 00:14:51.670
In that situation, our combined
area, and all the area coming

00:14:51.670 --> 00:14:54.140
from the square, would be 625.

00:14:54.140 --> 00:15:07.030
Well, what happens when
a is equal to 100?

00:15:07.030 --> 00:15:13.460
Well then, if this is equal
to 100, then the area

00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:14.310
of the square is 0.

00:15:14.310 --> 00:15:16.010
So we can actually even
ignore these terms.

00:15:16.010 --> 00:15:18.800
We actually know that this will
evaluate to 0, because we are

00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:20.760
committing no wire
to the square.

00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:23.440
And so what is the
area of the triangle?

00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:28.010
Well, this term right here was
the area of the triangle, so it

00:15:28.010 --> 00:15:36.620
equaled the square root of 3
over 36 times 100 squared.

00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:38.550
So what is that?

00:15:38.550 --> 00:15:40.610
Let's see if we can do that.

00:15:40.610 --> 00:15:48.440
So 3 square root divided by
36 is equal to, and then 100

00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:49.830
squared is 10,000, right?

00:15:49.830 --> 00:15:57.170
So times 110, 1, 2, 3.

00:15:57.170 --> 00:16:00.890
481.

00:16:00.890 --> 00:16:02.700
It equals 481.

00:16:02.700 --> 00:16:04.640
So what do we know?

00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:07.690
We know that if we cut it
exactly at 56.5, and actually

00:16:07.690 --> 00:16:10.830
there's a little bit more
precision that I didn't pay

00:16:10.830 --> 00:16:14.470
attention to, if we cut it at
roughly 56.5, the combined

00:16:14.470 --> 00:16:17.000
area, actually we haven't even
figured out what that combined

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.110
area is, but we know it's a
minimum point, because we're

00:16:19.110 --> 00:16:20.770
concave upward at that point.

00:16:20.770 --> 00:16:23.510
And as a fun exercise for you,
you might want to plug it into

00:16:23.510 --> 00:16:25.200
your calculator, and figure out
what the actual area is for

00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:27.910
that point, and realize
it is the low point.

00:16:27.910 --> 00:16:29.740
So that is the minimum value.

00:16:29.740 --> 00:16:33.640
That's how we minimize the area
of the square or the triangle.

00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:37.400
Now, if we committed all the
wire to the square, we get an

00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:40.640
area of 625, and all of
it comes to the square.

00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:46.150
If we cut it here, so all of
the wire is used to make the

00:16:46.150 --> 00:16:48.660
triangle, we get area of 481.

00:16:48.660 --> 00:16:53.080
So the maximum value is when a
is equal to 0, and our combined

00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:56.220
area is 625, because we're
doing a square with the whole

00:16:56.220 --> 00:17:02.170
wire, and the minimum value is
when we actually cut it

00:17:02.170 --> 00:17:04.850
right there at 56.5.

00:17:04.850 --> 00:17:11.180
So where we commit to 56.5 to
the triangle, and we commit,

00:17:11.180 --> 00:17:15.170
you know, the remainder, so
what is that, 43.5

00:17:15.170 --> 00:17:16.330
to the square.

00:17:16.330 --> 00:17:17.890
That's when we minimize it.

00:17:17.890 --> 00:17:20.840
That was that frankly a
fascinating problem, and I hope

00:17:20.840 --> 00:17:23.500
I got the problem right, and
even if I made a careless

00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:26.030
mistake, I think you understand
how to do the problem.

00:17:26.030 --> 00:17:27.260
I will see you in
the next video.
