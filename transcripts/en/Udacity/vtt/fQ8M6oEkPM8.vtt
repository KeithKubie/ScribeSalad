00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
So let's look a little closer at d and d'.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Well, to go up, it needs to go up the high h and again the high h down, so that's just 2h.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
That's not we know about the distance in the green frame. There's a term on this clock t.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Let's say we haven't measured the time it takes to go from the bottom to the top.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Well, then I know that this distance is just equal to velocity times time.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Remember that's an equation we can always use when something is moving at constant speed

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
and we believe that this light is moving at constant speed.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
That needs to go bottom to top the ct and to go top back to bottom is also ct,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
which means the total distance traveled is 2 ct.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
I know this is a lot of math but bear with me because it's about to get pretty interesting.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Now, let's look at the prime frame. In the prime frame, we have this right triangle.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Now, I'm going to tell you that one of these three sides of this triangle where it's length must be ct'

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
because we're talking about the prime frame.

00:00:53.000 --> 99:59:59.000
So I want you to tell me which of these three sides has a length of ct'.
