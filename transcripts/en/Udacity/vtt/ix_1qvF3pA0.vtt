00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.766
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; We can write ratios in many different ways. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; For example, if I want to

00:00:03.766 --> 00:00:07.936
write the number of dimes to the numbers of quarters, I could write it as 2 to

00:00:07.936 --> 00:00:12.131
3. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; I could write it using words, using a colon in between the two numbers, or

00:00:12.131 --> 00:00:15.951
using a fraction bar. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; All of these express a ratio. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; You might see this

00:00:15.951 --> 00:00:20.156
symbol later. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; I'm just using it to represent a number. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; This pound sign or

00:00:20.156 --> 00:00:24.371
hash tag is representing the word number. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; I just wanted to save some room

00:00:24.371 --> 00:00:25.425
when I was writing.
