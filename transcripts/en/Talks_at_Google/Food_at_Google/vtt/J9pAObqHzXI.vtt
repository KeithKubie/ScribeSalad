IRFAN: Hello.

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:03.783
Good afternoon, everybody.

00:00:03.783 --> 00:00:05.470
And welcome to KitchenSync.

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:06.420
My name is Irfan.

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.290
I'm the chef at Baadal, which
is the Indian restaurant

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:10.340
across campus.

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:13.754
So I'd like everyone
to welcome Josey Baker.

00:00:13.754 --> 00:00:18.151
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:18.151 --> 00:00:19.526
JOSEY BAKER: Thank
you very much.

00:00:19.526 --> 00:00:21.180
That's very flattering.

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.040
Thank you for having
me and everybody

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:24.330
who's welcomed me here.

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.300
I feel very, very comfy.

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.352
So that's really nice.

00:00:29.352 --> 00:00:30.310
And yeah, it was funny.

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:32.040
I was driving down.

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.720
So I'm Josey Baker.

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:35.635
My businesses Josey
Baker Bread, and I'm

00:00:35.635 --> 00:00:40.680
a co-owner of The Mill, which is
a cafe bakery in San Francisco

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.580
that I co-own with
Four Barrel Coffee.

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:49.700
And that's where we
bake all of our bread.

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:55.620
But I got my start a little over
five years ago baking at home.

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.290
And I just had a buddy
who was traveling

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:04.830
through San Francisco who had
a sourdough starter with him.

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.050
And I said, "Why do you
have sourdough starter?"

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:11.740
You can't-- I didn't really
think you could bake good bread

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:12.620
at home.

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:14.390
He said, yeah, you
can bake good bread.

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:15.973
So he scribbled down
some instructions

00:01:15.973 --> 00:01:18.290
and gifted me a little
bit of sourdough starter.

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:21.080
And a few days later I tried
it and just completely fell

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.200
in love with the
process of baking bread.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.870
And the nice thing about
the process of baking bread

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:33.530
is, the product is bread.

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.030
And bread is really nice
to share with people.

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:42.460
But I loved baking
so much that I just

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:44.570
started doing it all the time.

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:49.450
And again, you're
left with bread

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:54.100
after you go through
the process of baking.

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.600
Originally, I just started
storing the extra loaves

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.420
in my freezer.

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.540
And then my roommate
said, man, you

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.600
can't store more
bread in the freezer.

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.720
I said, OK.

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:07.070
I'm eating as much as I can.

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:08.580
I start giving it away.

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.970
And then one day a friend
says, I'll give you some money,

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.241
because he was getting
a lot bread from me.

00:02:14.241 --> 00:02:15.740
You know, I'll give
you a few bucks.

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:19.770
And I said, [SNAP] oh!

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:22.010
Sell the bread.

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.280
Good idea, Michael.

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:26.900
And that was sort
of how it began.

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.060
And funny enough, I didn't
even do this on purpose.

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.420
But this tub that
this dough is in

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:40.050
was one of the first
pieces of baking equipment

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:41.240
that I purchased.

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:45.790
And at the time I was
like, this is so huge.

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:48.860
This could hold so much dough.

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:53.360
And now at the mill, you know,
we're doing 350 loaves a day

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.730
or so.

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:58.330
But I drove down in
my truck with it.

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:01.670
And it felt like the good
old days because what I did

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:05.710
is I started baking at
home, and then started

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:08.150
selling it originally just
to friends and neighbors,

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:12.540
and then to strangers,
and pretty quickly had

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.790
to find a bigger space
to make the bread.

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:20.440
So I started renting space
from other businesses,

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:23.200
from MissionPie, which is a
pie bakery in the Mission,

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.950
then Pizzaiolo, which is an
Italian restaurant, California

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:30.060
Italian restaurant in Oakland
with a wood fired oven.

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:34.470
And I was doing
that all by myself.

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:36.531
And then Jeremy Tooker,
who's the founder, owner

00:03:36.531 --> 00:03:39.030
of Four Barrel Coffee approached
me and asked me if I wanted

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:40.300
to do a project with him.

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:43.390
And so we opened The Mill.

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:46.800
So that's me in a nutshell.

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:50.080
So what I'm going to talk about
today is, I'm really excited.

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:59.070
I've been fermenting some
ideas for a different type

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:00.160
of presentation.

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:04.170
I've done lots of how to make
bread at home classes before.

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:07.240
And I'm going to do that today.

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:10.590
But I'm going to have
kind of a new overlay

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:17.019
to it, which I think
are the principles that

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:19.110
make good bread.

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:21.620
And so if you take
these principles,

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:25.530
you can really apply
them to any style

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:30.322
of bread-- well, any grain,
really, which, at The Mill,

00:04:30.322 --> 00:04:31.780
we have a stone
mill in our bakery.

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:33.696
And we're always doing
lots of experimentation

00:04:33.696 --> 00:04:35.530
with different types of grain.

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:39.950
And I sort of stepped back and
looked at all of our breads

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:44.090
and sort of uncovered these
principles that were really

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:48.009
at the heart of all of
our breads, which are,

00:04:48.009 --> 00:04:49.175
they're sort of provocative.

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:53.910
Actually, wait.

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:54.820
Before I get that.

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:58.220
So what makes good bread?

00:04:58.220 --> 00:04:59.970
This is just my opinion.

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:05.370
But obviously, it
tastes good, right?

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:09.260
And so the types of bread
that I'm most interested in

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:12.480
are pretty simple breads.

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:18.440
They're breads that evoke the
most flavor from the grain

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:21.150
itself that the
bread is made from.

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:24.500
Not to say-- I love me
a delicious sweet bread

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:26.910
that's filled with
butter and sugar

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:32.889
and all types of, you know,
raisins and cheeses and all

00:05:32.889 --> 00:05:33.430
those things.

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:34.554
It makes a delicious bread.

00:05:34.554 --> 00:05:38.260
But what's most interesting to
me from the baking perspective

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:43.800
is really trying to evoke all of
the flavor from a grain itself.

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:45.450
So it tastes good.

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:47.800
It's good for you, right?

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:53.380
Bread is-- it can be,
I think it should be,

00:05:53.380 --> 00:06:00.860
the cornerstone of a healthy
diet-- which, not all bread can

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:01.690
fill that role.

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:07.770
And a loaf of bread
should keep well.

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:08.270
Yeah?

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:11.920
You should be able to have it
for a few days, ideally, not

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:13.980
because of a bunch of
artificial preservatives

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:17.490
that are pumped into it.

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:24.190
And made from responsible,
sustainable ingredients.

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:26.080
Yeah?

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:30.090
We all want to be good to
this world we're a part of.

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:34.490
And so, how do we get
all of those things?

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:38.220
I think one way is to follow
these five principles, which

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:46.961
are whole, wild,
wet, slow, and bold.

00:06:46.961 --> 00:06:47.460
Right?

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:50.230
And so what do
those things mean?

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:53.310
So that's what I'm going to
go through while showing you

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:54.670
how to make a loaf of bread.

00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:57.299
So there are handouts here.

00:06:57.299 --> 00:06:58.090
Just do me a favor.

00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:02.740
Don't get too caught up in them
throughout this presentation.

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:06.166
I'm not going to
really follow that.

00:07:06.166 --> 00:07:07.700
That stands on its own.

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:09.680
You can follow that at home.

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:13.330
It has exact quantities of all
the ingredients and everything.

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:16.030
Mostly what I want to
try to get out of this

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:19.510
is just some
helpful tidbits that

00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:21.394
will inspire you to
actually give it a shot

00:07:21.394 --> 00:07:22.810
because it's really
not that hard.

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:27.110
So whole.

00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:29.604
Whole grain.

00:07:29.604 --> 00:07:31.490
Let's see.

00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:34.234
So at The Mill, we
have-- and lots of people

00:07:34.234 --> 00:07:35.400
don't actually realize this.

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:39.780
But we have a mill, which is
the namesake of the place.

00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:41.370
And so it's a stone mill.

00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:44.400
And we use that mill to freshly
mill all of our whole grain

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:44.900
flour.

00:07:47.610 --> 00:07:52.570
And my mind is constantly being
blown by the variety of grains

00:07:52.570 --> 00:07:54.540
that you can use
for bread making.

00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:59.050
And so today, I just brought
two different whole grain stone

00:07:59.050 --> 00:08:00.480
ground flours.

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:03.620
This is Sonora flour,
which is a variety that

00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:05.650
has a really rich history
here in California.

00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:14.600
It's grown about two hours
northeast of the bakery.

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:16.000
I'll pass it around.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.385
It's really light in
color, mild in flavor.

00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:25.080
Just pass it around.

00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:28.580
And so that is a
type of white wheat.

00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:30.050
And here in this
big bag, which is

00:08:30.050 --> 00:08:34.570
what I'm going to use to mix
up a little bit of dough,

00:08:34.570 --> 00:08:37.150
is some red wheat.

00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:40.440
And so there's many
different types of wheat.

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:43.030
Red wheat and white wheat
are just categories.

00:08:43.030 --> 00:08:47.780
You've probably heard of spelt,
of camut, emmer, of durum,

00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:48.960
of rye.

00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:50.301
Rye is not wheat.

00:08:50.301 --> 00:08:51.800
But it is a grain
from which you can

00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:54.990
make totally delicious bread,
which is one of the breads

00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:57.150
that you'll all be eating today.

00:08:57.150 --> 00:08:58.680
The other bread
that you'll try is

00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:00.754
the bread made from
that Sonora, which

00:09:00.754 --> 00:09:01.920
we call California Heirloom.

00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:08.470
So most bread is made
from white flour.

00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:12.450
And what I mean by
that is, white flour

00:09:12.450 --> 00:09:20.270
is what you get if you
take powdered wheat berries

00:09:20.270 --> 00:09:26.300
and you take out the wheat
bran and the wheat germ.

00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:26.800
OK?

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:28.530
And so when you take
those things out,

00:09:28.530 --> 00:09:32.600
you have a pretty
shelf stable product.

00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:37.880
And you have a product
that's not as good for you

00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:40.100
and doesn't actually
taste as good.

00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:42.182
Definitely doesn't
taste as strongly.

00:09:42.182 --> 00:09:44.140
There aren't as many
flavors that are in there.

00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:51.050
I prefer bread that's made
with mostly whole grain.

00:09:51.050 --> 00:09:54.150
Again, I'm not
knocking white flour.

00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:56.330
We use a bunch of
it at the bakery.

00:09:56.330 --> 00:09:59.610
You can make really sweet,
airy loaves of bread.

00:09:59.610 --> 00:10:02.010
I just think if we're
trying to make bread that

00:10:02.010 --> 00:10:04.780
is really nutritive and
could be the cornerstone

00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:07.280
of a healthy diet, you need a
lot of whole grains in there.

00:10:10.650 --> 00:10:12.680
So the recipe that
ya'll have there

00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:15.275
is for 100% whole wheat bread.

00:10:15.275 --> 00:10:16.650
There's also a
few notes in there

00:10:16.650 --> 00:10:20.630
that if you want to add some
bread flour, lighten it up,

00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:22.170
you can totally do that.

00:10:22.170 --> 00:10:22.720
No problem.

00:10:27.010 --> 00:10:28.750
Do I want to accept
questions as we go?

00:10:28.750 --> 00:10:29.789
Or should I just blast?

00:10:29.789 --> 00:10:30.580
IRFAN: Well we can.

00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:33.110
But I think best would be to
go through and then accept

00:10:33.110 --> 00:10:35.660
questions right at the end
so that the presentation goes

00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:35.870
smooth.

00:10:35.870 --> 00:10:36.661
JOSEY BAKER: Great.

00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:41.140
Don't derail me with
any hard questions.

00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:41.950
IRFAN: Don't worry.

00:10:41.950 --> 00:10:42.450
You got it.

00:10:42.450 --> 00:10:43.116
JOSEY BAKER: OK.

00:10:43.116 --> 00:10:44.980
So that's whole, in a nutshell.

00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:48.240
Next up, wild.

00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:52.870
What I mean by wild is
wild yeast, sourdough.

00:10:52.870 --> 00:10:56.190
So we make all sourdough
bread at The Mill.

00:10:56.190 --> 00:11:01.200
We don't make, necessarily,
sour tasting bread.

00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:05.260
Sourdough is just a
culture of wild yeast

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:08.830
and bacteria in flour and water.

00:11:08.830 --> 00:11:09.560
And it's wild.

00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:12.080
It's the ambient yeasts that
are present on the grain,

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:16.620
in the bakery, in the
air, in your aura.

00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:21.040
And you use that to
make your bread rise,

00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:23.820
to give it amazing flavors,
to help it keep well.

00:11:28.060 --> 00:11:29.980
Totally delicious
breads can be made

00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:32.929
from commercial yeast, yeast
that's made in a factory

00:11:32.929 --> 00:11:34.095
that you can buy in a store.

00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:40.250
You can only use a little bit
because if you use too much,

00:11:40.250 --> 00:11:42.220
it ferments too quickly.

00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:43.790
Great flavors don't develop.

00:11:43.790 --> 00:11:47.660
The bread's going to
stale really quickly.

00:11:47.660 --> 00:11:49.217
We use all sourdough.

00:11:49.217 --> 00:11:50.800
It makes bread that's
more digestible.

00:11:55.560 --> 00:12:02.870
And it adds a layer of
complexity to the process.

00:12:02.870 --> 00:12:05.620
But I think it's
really worth it.

00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:09.855
And in the bakery
what we actually do--

00:12:09.855 --> 00:12:11.230
and this may
confuse some of you,

00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:13.900
but it also may really
simplify it for some of you--

00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:16.300
is we actually, for
most of our breads,

00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:20.630
we don't even have a separate
sourdough starter that we use.

00:12:20.630 --> 00:12:23.740
We actually just use some dough.

00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:27.190
So on today, we're
mixing our dough.

00:12:27.190 --> 00:12:29.590
My bakers are back in the
bakery right now mixing dough.

00:12:29.590 --> 00:12:32.030
And they're going to take
a bunch of that dough.

00:12:32.030 --> 00:12:36.690
And they're just going to put
it in the fridge until tomorrow.

00:12:36.690 --> 00:12:41.410
And then they'll mix that
into that day's bread dough.

00:12:41.410 --> 00:12:43.250
And it's all the same thing.

00:12:43.250 --> 00:12:49.620
It's all flour and water,
salt, wild yeast, bacteria.

00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:51.340
Yeah.

00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:54.157
So, obviously you can't
do that-- well, my guess

00:12:54.157 --> 00:12:56.490
is you can't do that at home
because you're probably not

00:12:56.490 --> 00:12:57.909
baking bread every day.

00:12:57.909 --> 00:12:59.700
So it's a little bit
more practical to have

00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:04.590
a sourdough starter that
you maintain on its own.

00:13:04.590 --> 00:13:07.980
And so, when you're starting
the life of a loaf of bread--

00:13:07.980 --> 00:13:11.810
and to feed your
starter, so simple.

00:13:11.810 --> 00:13:13.050
So, so, so simple.

00:13:13.050 --> 00:13:14.190
You throw out most of it.

00:13:14.190 --> 00:13:15.789
You compost it.

00:13:15.789 --> 00:13:16.330
And trust me.

00:13:16.330 --> 00:13:18.700
You want to compost it because
if you don't compost it--

00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:20.408
because what I used
to do was I was like,

00:13:20.408 --> 00:13:21.860
I can't compost the starter.

00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:23.215
I can't throw it out.

00:13:23.215 --> 00:13:25.700
It's my little pet.

00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:26.380
That pains me.

00:13:26.380 --> 00:13:28.790
And so I would
just bake with it.

00:13:28.790 --> 00:13:30.812
And then you end
up in my position.

00:13:30.812 --> 00:13:31.312
OK?

00:13:31.312 --> 00:13:33.640
So don't.

00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:35.729
So you just take a
little bit of it.

00:13:35.729 --> 00:13:36.707
Let's see, here.

00:13:42.086 --> 00:13:44.420
Yeah, don't worry about
the exact quantity.

00:13:44.420 --> 00:13:45.260
Oh yeah.

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:45.974
Move this?

00:13:45.974 --> 00:13:46.473
Yeah.

00:13:53.870 --> 00:13:56.610
Also, some folks,
I think, are really

00:13:56.610 --> 00:13:59.280
intimidated by using a scale.

00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:03.130
If you are interested
in bread baking,

00:14:03.130 --> 00:14:07.160
getting a scale is going to so
drastically simplify your life,

00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:09.780
especially in the early
phases, because you don't

00:14:09.780 --> 00:14:14.620
have that judgment to
know, oh, the dough's

00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:15.610
a little bit too wet.

00:14:15.610 --> 00:14:17.540
Oh, the dough's a
little bit too dry.

00:14:17.540 --> 00:14:23.000
And if you're measuring
by volume, a cup of flour,

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:27.690
there's a huge range in how much
flour actually fits in a cup.

00:14:27.690 --> 00:14:31.021
And so, because you're not
able to say, oh, shoot.

00:14:31.021 --> 00:14:32.520
I should add a
little bit more water

00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:36.460
because I compacted
the flour in the cup.

00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:38.910
It just kind of slows
your learning process,

00:14:38.910 --> 00:14:41.990
whereas if you use a scale,
you know exactly how much

00:14:41.990 --> 00:14:43.490
of everything you've added.

00:14:43.490 --> 00:14:45.140
And it's a breeze.

00:14:45.140 --> 00:14:49.680
So I, honestly, I didn't even
use a scale for the first six,

00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:52.090
eight months I was baking.

00:14:52.090 --> 00:14:53.290
Obviously, you can do it.

00:14:53.290 --> 00:14:55.039
There's plenty of great
recipes out there.

00:14:55.039 --> 00:14:57.127
But I think it's really helpful.

00:14:57.127 --> 00:14:59.210
So we'll put in a little
bit of sourdough starter.

00:15:05.580 --> 00:15:08.824
IRFAN: Now Josey, where can
we buy sourdough starter?

00:15:08.824 --> 00:15:11.490
JOSEY BAKER: So you can actually
make your own sourdough starter

00:15:11.490 --> 00:15:11.990
yourself.

00:15:11.990 --> 00:15:12.745
It's super simple.

00:15:12.745 --> 00:15:14.286
You just mix together
flour and water

00:15:14.286 --> 00:15:15.910
and you let it sit for a day.

00:15:15.910 --> 00:15:18.130
You throw out most of it.

00:15:18.130 --> 00:15:19.690
You do it again.

00:15:19.690 --> 00:15:23.530
And if you use whole
grain rye flour,

00:15:23.530 --> 00:15:26.831
you're going to have a better
chance of having success

00:15:26.831 --> 00:15:27.330
with that.

00:15:30.470 --> 00:15:34.470
And you basically just do
that for two weeks or so.

00:15:34.470 --> 00:15:38.480
And you should have
a healthy starter.

00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:42.110
You can visit a bakery, see if
they'll part with some of it.

00:15:45.310 --> 00:15:47.835
I'm going to pour in
a little bit of water.

00:15:52.230 --> 00:15:53.119
A little more.

00:15:53.119 --> 00:15:54.160
I'm just winging it here.

00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:55.743
Don't pay attention
to the quantities.

00:15:55.743 --> 00:15:58.830
I'm just showing you
the basic process.

00:15:58.830 --> 00:16:00.510
You want to break
up the starter.

00:16:00.510 --> 00:16:04.824
And so, another
thing that I think

00:16:04.824 --> 00:16:06.490
is really intimidating
when you're first

00:16:06.490 --> 00:16:10.302
learning how to bake is how to
fit it into your life, right?

00:16:10.302 --> 00:16:11.510
You're all at work right now.

00:16:11.510 --> 00:16:17.989
You can't be like, doing
this hours long process.

00:16:17.989 --> 00:16:20.280
But it's actually really easy
to fit it into your life.

00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:24.670
And the way to do that
is to use the fridge.

00:16:24.670 --> 00:16:29.571
And you basically can do any
of these phases of the process,

00:16:29.571 --> 00:16:31.820
stick the dough in the fridge,
and then just get to it

00:16:31.820 --> 00:16:33.880
when you're home from
work or when you woke up

00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:36.190
or when you're back
from your camping trip.

00:16:36.190 --> 00:16:37.810
It's really actually
very flexible.

00:16:41.331 --> 00:16:42.720
OK.

00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:47.160
And now, a little bit of
this whole grain flour.

00:16:49.950 --> 00:16:52.230
Could I get just a
spoon, a wooden spoon?

00:16:58.870 --> 00:16:59.830
Thank you.

00:17:03.530 --> 00:17:04.030
Yeah.

00:17:04.030 --> 00:17:05.446
And all I'm going
to show you here

00:17:05.446 --> 00:17:07.670
is about what the
consistency should look like.

00:17:07.670 --> 00:17:08.170
Yeah.

00:17:08.170 --> 00:17:11.735
That's my hope, is to give you
just some sort of landmarks,

00:17:11.735 --> 00:17:15.680
some signposts along the
way, so you can say, oh yeah.

00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:17.650
This kind of looks
like what he did.

00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:22.910
This is just one way of
making bread, though.

00:17:22.910 --> 00:17:24.920
There's many different ways.

00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:29.700
Again, so you see how I'm
relying on my judgment here.

00:17:29.700 --> 00:17:33.058
If you have a scale, you
just pour in-- oh god,

00:17:33.058 --> 00:17:34.960
I keep doing that--
if you have a scale,

00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:37.972
you just pour in
the exact amount.

00:17:37.972 --> 00:17:39.180
And you don't worry about it.

00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:44.770
OK?

00:17:44.770 --> 00:17:46.035
So something like that.

00:17:46.035 --> 00:17:48.180
Can you see this?

00:17:48.180 --> 00:17:48.690
Yeah.

00:17:48.690 --> 00:17:51.830
It's kind of like a
thick pancake batter.

00:17:51.830 --> 00:17:52.710
Yeah?

00:17:52.710 --> 00:17:56.530
And at about this consistency,
with about that much starter,

00:17:56.530 --> 00:17:59.760
this is going to be
good to go for-- you

00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:03.950
let it sit for eight to 12
hours at room temperature.

00:18:03.950 --> 00:18:04.589
Yeah?

00:18:04.589 --> 00:18:05.880
So that's a nice number, right?

00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:08.190
It's about how long
you're at work,

00:18:08.190 --> 00:18:12.460
somewhere in there, about
how long you're sleeping.

00:18:12.460 --> 00:18:14.840
And you'll come back to it.

00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:18.874
And it will have all sorts
of bubbles on the surface.

00:18:18.874 --> 00:18:20.290
It'll look like
it's really alive.

00:18:20.290 --> 00:18:21.150
And that's great.

00:18:21.150 --> 00:18:22.024
That's what you want.

00:18:22.024 --> 00:18:24.601
You're sort of getting this--
this is like a pre-dough.

00:18:24.601 --> 00:18:25.100
Yeah?

00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:28.160
You're getting this ready to
mix into your bread dough.

00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:29.810
But it's just the same thing.

00:18:29.810 --> 00:18:32.420
It's a little bit of
starter, flour, water.

00:18:32.420 --> 00:18:34.780
And so we're just going
to do that again, right?

00:18:34.780 --> 00:18:38.840
So we're going to fast
forward eight to 12 hours.

00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:39.770
This is smelling nice.

00:18:39.770 --> 00:18:40.860
You can see bubbles.

00:18:40.860 --> 00:18:43.440
Yeah?

00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:52.000
And so that brings me to the
third principle, which is wet.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:53.600
Wet dough.

00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:54.100
Yeah?

00:18:54.100 --> 00:18:59.841
So most bread dough, it's just
not made with enough water.

00:18:59.841 --> 00:19:00.340
Right?

00:19:00.340 --> 00:19:02.870
And it's made not
with enough water

00:19:02.870 --> 00:19:08.421
because it's really easy to
handle stiff bread dough,

00:19:08.421 --> 00:19:08.920
right?

00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:11.030
So if any of you have
made bread or you've

00:19:11.030 --> 00:19:15.410
seen people make bread
before, they mix the dough.

00:19:15.410 --> 00:19:17.280
And then, if they're
doing it by hand,

00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:18.960
they put it out on the counter.

00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:21.300
And they use some flour.

00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:23.432
And they rub it
around and push it.

00:19:23.432 --> 00:19:25.390
And we're not going to
actually do any of that.

00:19:25.390 --> 00:19:27.090
We're going to leave it in
the bowl the whole time.

00:19:27.090 --> 00:19:28.580
And we're just
going to use water

00:19:28.580 --> 00:19:29.930
to have it not stick to things.

00:19:33.030 --> 00:19:37.310
I think that, especially with
whole grain flours, whole grain

00:19:37.310 --> 00:19:38.930
breads, it just
needs more water.

00:19:38.930 --> 00:19:40.555
You've got that bran
and germ in there.

00:19:40.555 --> 00:19:43.830
It's going to soak
up more water.

00:19:43.830 --> 00:19:47.450
That's going to lead to a better
texture in your bread, better

00:19:47.450 --> 00:19:51.580
flavors in your bread, and
better keeping quality, right?

00:19:51.580 --> 00:19:53.640
Starts out with more
water, it's going

00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:55.410
to retain more water over time.

00:20:00.330 --> 00:20:05.560
Some people say high hydration,
high hydration doughs.

00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:09.320
I've started saying fully
hydrated doughs or properly

00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:17.220
hydrated doughs, because
high hydration kind of misses

00:20:17.220 --> 00:20:20.860
the point depending on what
grain you're working with,

00:20:20.860 --> 00:20:23.210
because some
grains-- every grain

00:20:23.210 --> 00:20:25.330
has a different absorption.

00:20:25.330 --> 00:20:25.830
Yeah?

00:20:25.830 --> 00:20:28.150
And so like that sonora,
that light colored flour

00:20:28.150 --> 00:20:29.970
in the bread that
we're going to eat?

00:20:29.970 --> 00:20:34.370
That particular crop
is super absorbent.

00:20:34.370 --> 00:20:39.920
It absorbs 30% more
water than another grain

00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:42.710
that we work with.

00:20:42.710 --> 00:20:44.810
But we also make this bread.

00:20:44.810 --> 00:20:47.060
It's probably my favorite
bread that I, unfortunately,

00:20:47.060 --> 00:20:50.760
don't have today because
the grain ran out.

00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:52.160
Einkorn bread.

00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:58.790
That bread absorbs-- the Einkorn
absorbs 75 grams of water

00:20:58.790 --> 00:21:00.890
for every 100 grams of flour.

00:21:00.890 --> 00:21:05.212
That Sonora absorbs
110 grams of water

00:21:05.212 --> 00:21:06.420
for every 100 grams of flour.

00:21:06.420 --> 00:21:08.320
So a huge difference, right?

00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:12.460
So calling the Einkorn
high hydration-- it's

00:21:12.460 --> 00:21:14.175
a little misleading.

00:21:14.175 --> 00:21:14.675
Anyway.

00:21:18.560 --> 00:21:22.070
So we're going to put water in.

00:21:22.070 --> 00:21:25.610
And we're just going to disperse
your sourdough pre-ferment

00:21:25.610 --> 00:21:26.350
here.

00:21:26.350 --> 00:21:28.032
Just get it dissolved in there.

00:21:28.032 --> 00:21:29.490
And when you're
doing this at home,

00:21:29.490 --> 00:21:31.865
you're paying really close
attention to the numbers here.

00:21:31.865 --> 00:21:33.886
Yeah?

00:21:33.886 --> 00:21:34.385
Right?

00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:39.600
You're going to add some
more whole wheat flour.

00:21:54.060 --> 00:21:56.820
And this really, this is
exactly the same process

00:21:56.820 --> 00:21:59.130
we do at the bakery, just
obviously in a much smaller

00:21:59.130 --> 00:21:59.630
scale.

00:21:59.630 --> 00:22:01.670
But this is it.

00:22:01.670 --> 00:22:08.090
The thing that makes
it tricky is that--

00:22:08.090 --> 00:22:11.820
and you'll learn this, which
is what makes bread baking

00:22:11.820 --> 00:22:15.940
infinitely challenging and
fulfilling and intriguing,

00:22:15.940 --> 00:22:18.090
is that every day--
especially if you're

00:22:18.090 --> 00:22:20.650
working with a sourdough
culture-- every day,

00:22:20.650 --> 00:22:22.640
things are a little
bit different.

00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:25.240
And so you have to really
be tuned into the dough.

00:22:34.810 --> 00:22:36.572
So this would be a
really wet dough.

00:22:36.572 --> 00:22:38.030
I'm going to add
a little bit more.

00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:49.700
And again, when
you're starting out,

00:22:49.700 --> 00:22:53.009
it's OK to add a little
bit more flour just

00:22:53.009 --> 00:22:54.800
to make things easier
to handle, because it

00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:58.859
can be kind of a
bummer if you're

00:22:58.859 --> 00:23:01.150
going through the process of
making your loaf of bread,

00:23:01.150 --> 00:23:04.140
you're all excited, you got your
friends coming over for dinner

00:23:04.140 --> 00:23:06.910
the next night-- I'm baking
bread for the party--

00:23:06.910 --> 00:23:11.580
and you get to the shaping
phase of bread baking.

00:23:11.580 --> 00:23:16.130
And you screw it all up,
which I've done many times.

00:23:24.580 --> 00:23:28.292
IRFAN: So you're using water
to shape rather than flour?

00:23:28.292 --> 00:23:29.000
JOSEY BAKER: Yes.

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:31.760
Well, I'm going to use
flour to do the final shape

00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:32.760
in a little bit.

00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:33.740
But yeah.

00:23:33.740 --> 00:23:35.320
I'm just trying to
not-- I'm trying

00:23:35.320 --> 00:23:40.490
to keep the ratio of flour
and water in that sweet spot.

00:23:40.490 --> 00:23:44.381
And if anything, I go a
little bit on the wet side.

00:23:44.381 --> 00:23:44.880
IRFAN: OK.

00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:46.199
JOSEY BAKER: Yeah.

00:23:46.199 --> 00:23:47.740
IRFAN: So while
you're working, is it

00:23:47.740 --> 00:23:48.860
OK to ask you a
couple questions?

00:23:48.860 --> 00:23:49.470
JOSEY BAKER: Of course, man.

00:23:49.470 --> 00:23:49.970
IRFAN: OK.

00:23:49.970 --> 00:23:53.510
So for the bunch of us who
shop at regular grocery stores,

00:23:53.510 --> 00:23:56.330
what kind of flour do
you recommend we get?

00:23:56.330 --> 00:23:59.280
JOSEY BAKER: We are very
fortunate to have some really

00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:06.620
nice options that are
local, like Giusto's.

00:24:06.620 --> 00:24:09.210
Central Milling is a
company up in Petaluma.

00:24:09.210 --> 00:24:12.290
I don't think their
flour is super easy

00:24:12.290 --> 00:24:13.660
to find in grocery stores.

00:24:13.660 --> 00:24:17.340
But I, for the first year or so,
I would go to Rainbow Grocery

00:24:17.340 --> 00:24:21.740
in San Francisco and just like,
load up my backpack with like,

00:24:21.740 --> 00:24:26.176
you know, I'd stand in the bulk
bin filling up sacks of flour,

00:24:26.176 --> 00:24:29.120
which I think they use Giusto's.

00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:32.980
King Arthur Flour is something
that's really widely available.

00:24:32.980 --> 00:24:36.226
It's a great flour
company out of Vermont.

00:24:36.226 --> 00:24:36.935
IRFAN: All right.

00:24:36.935 --> 00:24:37.684
JOSEY BAKER: Yeah.

00:24:37.684 --> 00:24:38.240
IRFAN: Super.

00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:40.700
JOSEY BAKER: Yeah, Bob's
Red Mill is awesome.

00:24:40.700 --> 00:24:41.200
OK.

00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:41.690
Here's this.

00:24:41.690 --> 00:24:42.840
AUDIENCE: Do you guys
sell flour at The Mill?

00:24:42.840 --> 00:24:44.673
JOSEY BAKER: We also
sell flour at The Mill.

00:24:44.673 --> 00:24:46.126
Yeah.

00:24:46.126 --> 00:24:49.563
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] Can you
use the same flour as the bread

00:24:49.563 --> 00:24:50.437
you're going to make?

00:24:50.437 --> 00:24:52.301
JOSEY BAKER: No.

00:24:52.301 --> 00:24:53.800
AUDIENCE: Can you
[? repeat that? ?]

00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:54.590
JOSEY BAKER: He's
wondering about,

00:24:54.590 --> 00:24:57.034
with your starter, what kind
of flour do you have to use.

00:24:57.034 --> 00:24:58.200
Do you have to use the same?

00:24:58.200 --> 00:24:59.330
And no, you don't.

00:24:59.330 --> 00:25:02.700
So even this starter
that I brought,

00:25:02.700 --> 00:25:06.740
because we don't use a starter
for most of our breads--

00:25:06.740 --> 00:25:08.270
we don't use a
starter that we keep

00:25:08.270 --> 00:25:10.880
separate from most of our breads
we do that old dough method.

00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:12.810
But this is actually
a rye starter,

00:25:12.810 --> 00:25:14.810
because we do keep a
starter for our rye bread

00:25:14.810 --> 00:25:17.340
because we don't make
it every single day.

00:25:17.340 --> 00:25:19.150
But so this was all
whole grain rye flour.

00:25:19.150 --> 00:25:21.500
And then I just added
whole wheat flour.

00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:23.840
Just something to
consider is that, whatever

00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:27.910
flour you use for your
starter, that flour's

00:25:27.910 --> 00:25:30.560
going to then be in your
final loaf of bread, right?

00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:34.720
So if you don't mind a little
bit of rye, no problem.

00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:35.220
Yeah.

00:25:38.180 --> 00:25:40.050
I forgot one thing in this.

00:25:40.050 --> 00:25:41.200
Who can tell me what it is?

00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:42.120
AUDIENCE: Salt.

00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:45.500
JOSEY BAKER: Salt. It
is a rite of passage.

00:25:45.500 --> 00:25:51.000
It's a rite of passage
in the life of a baker

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:58.380
to forget the salt, which at
home, you're very disappointed

00:25:58.380 --> 00:26:00.700
in yourself when it happens.

00:26:00.700 --> 00:26:05.500
In a bakery where we're
making 350 loaves,

00:26:05.500 --> 00:26:08.310
you've got a few people that
are very disappointed in you.

00:26:08.310 --> 00:26:13.840
But really, you
usually can find a way

00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:16.860
to make it work because
basically, what you then

00:26:16.860 --> 00:26:19.035
have is a starter.

00:26:22.067 --> 00:26:23.650
But you're going to
be mixing it again

00:26:23.650 --> 00:26:26.540
because if you
don't have the salt,

00:26:26.540 --> 00:26:28.720
the dough's ferment
a lot faster.

00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:30.890
Salt actually
slows fermentation.

00:26:30.890 --> 00:26:34.962
It also helps bring out
the flavors of the grain.

00:26:34.962 --> 00:26:36.670
But you'll know it
before you bake it off

00:26:36.670 --> 00:26:40.000
because the dough will
be behaving differently

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:43.015
than usual.

00:26:43.015 --> 00:26:45.370
AUDIENCE: Are you using
sugar for fermentation?

00:26:45.370 --> 00:26:45.890
JOSEY BAKER: Say
that one more time.

00:26:45.890 --> 00:26:47.931
AUDIENCE: Are you using
a sugar for fermentation?

00:26:47.931 --> 00:26:48.611
JOSEY BAKER: No.

00:26:48.611 --> 00:26:49.110
No.

00:26:49.110 --> 00:26:50.950
AUDIENCE: So it
works without sugar?

00:26:50.950 --> 00:26:51.210
JOSEY BAKER: Yeah.

00:26:51.210 --> 00:26:51.470
Totally.

00:26:51.470 --> 00:26:52.020
Yeah, just--

00:26:52.020 --> 00:26:53.620
AUDIENCE: Some people think
that you need the sugar to--

00:26:53.620 --> 00:26:54.040
JOSEY BAKER: Yeah.

00:26:54.040 --> 00:26:56.580
So there's lots of opinions out
there on sourdough starters.

00:26:56.580 --> 00:26:58.870
Some people use pineapple juice.

00:26:58.870 --> 00:27:01.550
Some people use raisins.

00:27:01.550 --> 00:27:06.880
I've had great experience using
whole grain rye flour and water

00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:08.782
and nothing else.

00:27:08.782 --> 00:27:10.740
That's not to say that,
in certain environments

00:27:10.740 --> 00:27:13.570
with certain flours,
that might not be enough.

00:27:13.570 --> 00:27:14.860
I just haven't experienced it.

00:27:14.860 --> 00:27:16.443
Nor have I experienced
it from anybody

00:27:16.443 --> 00:27:18.790
I've directly talked with.

00:27:18.790 --> 00:27:20.859
So I'm just going to
fold that salt in.

00:27:20.859 --> 00:27:21.900
Just going to mush it in.

00:27:25.500 --> 00:27:27.370
AUDIENCE: Can you
overmix at any point?

00:27:27.370 --> 00:27:29.855
IRFAN: The question is, can
you overmix at any point?

00:27:29.855 --> 00:27:31.730
JOSEY BAKER: If you're
mixing it in a machine

00:27:31.730 --> 00:27:33.370
mixer-- who asked that?

00:27:33.370 --> 00:27:35.680
If you're mixing it in a
machine mixer you totally can.

00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:37.841
By hand, you don't really
have to worry about it.

00:27:37.841 --> 00:27:38.340
Yeah.

00:27:38.340 --> 00:27:42.350
And this method that I
describe in the handout

00:27:42.350 --> 00:27:46.470
and I'm showing you
now, just all hand mix.

00:27:46.470 --> 00:27:49.900
You're just getting
the salt incorporated.

00:27:49.900 --> 00:27:51.392
IRFAN: Still is pretty sticky.

00:27:51.392 --> 00:27:52.350
JOSEY BAKER: Yes it is.

00:27:52.350 --> 00:27:56.110
This would be on
the stickier side.

00:27:56.110 --> 00:28:01.347
If you're feeling like being
wild, that would be fine.

00:28:01.347 --> 00:28:03.430
Probably would be a little
bit tricky to deal with

00:28:03.430 --> 00:28:04.846
if you haven't
handled much dough.

00:28:07.923 --> 00:28:09.760
OK.

00:28:09.760 --> 00:28:10.650
Whole, wild, wet.

00:28:13.160 --> 00:28:13.910
AUDIENCE: Slow.

00:28:13.910 --> 00:28:14.880
JOSEY BAKER: Slow.

00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:18.260
[INAUDIBLE] Slow.

00:28:18.260 --> 00:28:23.950
So what I mean by that--
slow fermentation, right?

00:28:23.950 --> 00:28:30.150
Most bread is made in a few
hours from the time the flour

00:28:30.150 --> 00:28:34.630
and water, salt, yeast
are mixed together,

00:28:34.630 --> 00:28:37.740
to the point when its baked.

00:28:37.740 --> 00:28:43.690
You can pull it off on
a timescale like that.

00:28:43.690 --> 00:28:50.250
But bread's really going to be
better if you don't rush it,

00:28:50.250 --> 00:28:50.850
right?

00:28:50.850 --> 00:28:53.100
And that's one of the things
that I loved about baking

00:28:53.100 --> 00:28:59.260
from the very
beginning, was that it

00:28:59.260 --> 00:29:04.970
made me slow down and just--
when the dough is fermenting,

00:29:04.970 --> 00:29:09.810
you can't do anything but wait.

00:29:09.810 --> 00:29:12.470
And it's kind of
nice to be engaged

00:29:12.470 --> 00:29:17.040
in a practice that requires
you to engage in that waiting.

00:29:19.900 --> 00:29:24.440
The way we do things at
The Mill is, today we're

00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:28.030
mixing up bread dough
with our starter, which

00:29:28.030 --> 00:29:30.500
is just yesterday's dough.

00:29:30.500 --> 00:29:32.740
And this afternoon, we'll
shape it into bread loves.

00:29:32.740 --> 00:29:34.370
And then we'll
put in the fridge.

00:29:34.370 --> 00:29:36.220
And we'll bake it
tomorrow morning.

00:29:36.220 --> 00:29:37.400
So again, that fridge.

00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:38.990
If I could give you
one little trick.

00:29:38.990 --> 00:29:42.340
It's like, bread baking
can really easily

00:29:42.340 --> 00:29:43.690
fit into your life.

00:29:43.690 --> 00:29:45.270
Just use the fridge.

00:29:45.270 --> 00:29:47.360
I used to stick bread
dough in the fridge

00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:50.170
all weekend long while I'd
go out on a camping trip.

00:29:50.170 --> 00:29:51.380
And I'd come back.

00:29:51.380 --> 00:29:52.900
And I'd bake it off.

00:29:52.900 --> 00:29:56.440
Sometimes it was disgusting.

00:29:56.440 --> 00:30:00.000
And other times, it was
a lot better, right?

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:03.620
And so that's where
the subtlety comes in.

00:30:03.620 --> 00:30:05.920
How active was your starter?

00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:08.490
How long did you let it
sit before you shaped it

00:30:08.490 --> 00:30:10.810
into a bread loaf?

00:30:10.810 --> 00:30:13.040
How long did it sit
shaped in a bread loaf

00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:15.880
before you baked it off?

00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:16.870
Too much to get into.

00:30:16.870 --> 00:30:20.890
But if you start
baking some bread

00:30:20.890 --> 00:30:24.150
you'll pick up on those things.

00:30:24.150 --> 00:30:25.775
So you do what I
just did to that.

00:30:29.120 --> 00:30:31.400
So we're not going to
take it out and knead it

00:30:31.400 --> 00:30:33.270
on a flour-covered
counter at all.

00:30:33.270 --> 00:30:35.700
We're going to
stretch it and fold it

00:30:35.700 --> 00:30:39.470
in the bowl about every
half hour for a few hours.

00:30:39.470 --> 00:30:40.340
Yeah?

00:30:40.340 --> 00:30:42.440
Do that about four times.

00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:43.830
So you pull it.

00:30:43.830 --> 00:30:47.040
Fold it back on itself.

00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:48.302
Fold it back on itself.

00:30:48.302 --> 00:30:50.010
This is exactly what
we do in the bakery.

00:30:50.010 --> 00:30:54.600
We just do it with big bus
tubs, like 15 kilos of dough.

00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:55.100
Yeah?

00:30:55.100 --> 00:30:56.310
And so you're doing this.

00:30:56.310 --> 00:30:58.200
And you can tell already.

00:30:58.200 --> 00:31:00.710
See how the dough can
stretch a little bit, right?

00:31:00.710 --> 00:31:02.664
It's not just like
a lump of paste.

00:31:02.664 --> 00:31:03.830
We're developing the gluten.

00:31:06.730 --> 00:31:09.900
And we're developing the
gluten without oxidizing

00:31:09.900 --> 00:31:12.010
the dough, which
is what can happen

00:31:12.010 --> 00:31:17.500
if you mix it aggressively
in a machine mixer.

00:31:17.500 --> 00:31:19.870
And that's not going to help
you out with your flavors,

00:31:19.870 --> 00:31:22.325
with your aromas,
with your nutrition.

00:31:25.030 --> 00:31:28.400
And just a little bit of water.

00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:29.640
Yeah?

00:31:29.640 --> 00:31:30.330
And that's good.

00:31:30.330 --> 00:31:31.380
Leave it alone for a half hour.

00:31:31.380 --> 00:31:32.080
I go for a walk.

00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:33.480
I read a book, take a nap.

00:31:36.750 --> 00:31:41.660
And after a few hours of that,
again, if you want to go to bed

00:31:41.660 --> 00:31:44.520
or you want to go to
work, just do that

00:31:44.520 --> 00:31:46.010
and stick it in the fridge.

00:31:46.010 --> 00:31:47.260
Just cover it up.

00:31:47.260 --> 00:31:49.212
And just get to it
when you get to it.

00:31:49.212 --> 00:31:50.670
AUDIENCE: Is
temperature important?

00:31:50.670 --> 00:31:52.670
JOSEY BAKER: Temperature
is extremely important.

00:31:52.670 --> 00:31:56.250
I, again, when I
was starting out,

00:31:56.250 --> 00:32:00.450
I didn't take temperature of
anything for the first six,

00:32:00.450 --> 00:32:02.200
eight months.

00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:05.970
It leads to
unpredictable results

00:32:05.970 --> 00:32:10.840
because that dough is a
certain temperature, right?

00:32:10.840 --> 00:32:12.640
I just don't know what it is.

00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:15.931
If you know what is, then
you can control things.

00:32:15.931 --> 00:32:16.430
Yeah?

00:32:16.430 --> 00:32:19.360
You can say, like
in the bakery, we

00:32:19.360 --> 00:32:23.410
want this dough to be ready
to divide in three hours.

00:32:23.410 --> 00:32:29.740
We adjust the water
temperature to an exact degree

00:32:29.740 --> 00:32:33.000
in order to ensure that
that fermentation proceeds

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:34.600
at the schedule we want.

00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:38.970
Basically the rule of thumb
is warmer temperatures

00:32:38.970 --> 00:32:42.066
make things happen faster.

00:32:42.066 --> 00:32:42.565
OK?

00:32:45.300 --> 00:32:48.410
Cooler temperatures
slow things down.

00:32:48.410 --> 00:32:50.890
I'm going to divide this dough.

00:32:50.890 --> 00:32:54.216
So this is some dough that
was mixed up this morning.

00:32:54.216 --> 00:32:55.090
Can I work over here?

00:32:55.090 --> 00:32:56.054
Is this OK?

00:32:56.054 --> 00:32:56.554
Yeah?

00:33:11.220 --> 00:33:13.900
Slow fermentation.

00:33:13.900 --> 00:33:14.401
Yeah?

00:33:14.401 --> 00:33:16.066
AUDIENCE: I'm wondering,
why do you take

00:33:16.066 --> 00:33:17.570
that half hour break in the--

00:33:17.570 --> 00:33:18.690
JOSEY BAKER: Yeah.

00:33:18.690 --> 00:33:19.190
Yeah.

00:33:19.190 --> 00:33:22.960
So in order to fully develop
the gluten with this method,

00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:25.870
you need to let the
dough relax, right?

00:33:25.870 --> 00:33:27.805
Because if you do
it, you'll feel it.

00:33:27.805 --> 00:33:31.210
If you do it too much, you'll
just start tearing the dough.

00:33:31.210 --> 00:33:31.710
Yeah?

00:33:31.710 --> 00:33:32.810
So you slow down.

00:33:32.810 --> 00:33:34.620
And you let some
fermentation occur,

00:33:34.620 --> 00:33:36.642
which also helps
strengthen the gluten.

00:33:40.980 --> 00:33:41.792
IRFAN: It's sticky.

00:33:41.792 --> 00:33:42.500
JOSEY BAKER: Yes.

00:33:42.500 --> 00:33:43.650
So this is a little sticky.

00:33:43.650 --> 00:33:45.274
And I sort of cut
some corners on this.

00:33:45.274 --> 00:33:46.740
We'll see if we
can make it work.

00:33:46.740 --> 00:33:51.200
So again, I'm just using
a little bit of water

00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:52.270
so that it doesn't stick.

00:33:56.720 --> 00:33:59.360
And so now I'm going to
pre-shape the dough, which

00:33:59.360 --> 00:34:00.670
is just making it into a round.

00:34:06.830 --> 00:34:08.800
Just do that.

00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:09.300
No.

00:34:09.300 --> 00:34:11.710
When I was first
learning how to do this,

00:34:11.710 --> 00:34:15.102
I actually used to do it
in the air, in my hands.

00:34:15.102 --> 00:34:16.810
And that's because I
was doing it at home

00:34:16.810 --> 00:34:19.370
and I didn't have enough
bench space on my kitchen

00:34:19.370 --> 00:34:20.840
counter to do it.

00:34:20.840 --> 00:34:23.530
There's lots of ways to do this.

00:34:23.530 --> 00:34:27.370
We do it this way so that we
don't incorporate more flour,

00:34:27.370 --> 00:34:29.650
because at this point--
so this dough has just

00:34:29.650 --> 00:34:32.929
completed its bulk fermentation,
its first fermentation.

00:34:32.929 --> 00:34:34.905
So all that flour has
been mixed with water.

00:34:34.905 --> 00:34:35.850
And it's fermented.

00:34:38.610 --> 00:34:40.429
If we incorporate
more flour now,

00:34:40.429 --> 00:34:43.815
it's not going to have the
opportunity to ferment.

00:34:43.815 --> 00:34:44.314
OK?

00:34:47.010 --> 00:34:52.800
This can be tricky if you
haven't done this much before.

00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:57.610
But it's, I think, a
little less important

00:34:57.610 --> 00:35:00.160
than the final shape,
which I'm going to show you

00:35:00.160 --> 00:35:01.590
how to do right afterwards.

00:35:01.590 --> 00:35:04.295
And we're about to run out
of time, which is perfect.

00:35:09.170 --> 00:35:09.670
Yeah?

00:35:14.600 --> 00:35:15.590
OK?

00:35:15.590 --> 00:35:17.190
So there's that.

00:35:17.190 --> 00:35:26.960
And now we're going to introduce
just a little bit of flour.

00:35:26.960 --> 00:35:28.970
And we usually do
this with bread flour.

00:35:28.970 --> 00:35:33.547
But you can totally do it
with whole grain flour.

00:35:33.547 --> 00:35:34.380
Where's that sonora?

00:35:34.380 --> 00:35:35.640
This it?

00:35:35.640 --> 00:35:36.900
AUDIENCE: I think so.

00:35:36.900 --> 00:35:37.430
JOSEY BAKER: Does anyone?

00:35:37.430 --> 00:35:37.930
IRFAN: Sonora.

00:35:37.930 --> 00:35:38.430
Cool.

00:35:38.430 --> 00:35:41.076
Here we go.

00:35:41.076 --> 00:35:41.867
JOSEY BAKER: Great.

00:35:49.841 --> 00:35:50.340
OK.

00:35:50.340 --> 00:35:52.870
So I'll just do one of these.

00:35:52.870 --> 00:35:55.140
And then I'll talk
you through the bake

00:35:55.140 --> 00:36:03.470
real quickly, which is
the last principle, bold.

00:36:03.470 --> 00:36:04.070
OK.

00:36:04.070 --> 00:36:05.950
So we've put flour on top.

00:36:05.950 --> 00:36:07.570
And you can tell
it's not sticking.

00:36:07.570 --> 00:36:09.510
We've got a little flour
on the surface here.

00:36:09.510 --> 00:36:11.350
So I'm going to
flip it on its head.

00:36:15.840 --> 00:36:18.540
So we're going to just--
watch what I do here.

00:36:18.540 --> 00:36:25.119
We're going to fold the
bottom up 2/3, 3/4 or so.

00:36:25.119 --> 00:36:27.410
And we're going to do the
same thing to the other side.

00:36:33.228 --> 00:36:33.728
Yeah?

00:36:33.728 --> 00:36:36.775
Then we're going to spin it.

00:36:36.775 --> 00:36:37.900
Nice little package, right?

00:36:37.900 --> 00:36:40.390
So a little bit
tapered on the top.

00:36:40.390 --> 00:36:42.690
Take this top.

00:36:42.690 --> 00:36:43.310
Fold it down.

00:36:45.815 --> 00:36:49.380
Then just fold it over again.

00:36:49.380 --> 00:36:51.765
Then I'll change
this so you can see.

00:36:51.765 --> 00:36:53.037
So here's the seam, here.

00:36:53.037 --> 00:36:55.120
So you're just going to
use the palm of your hand.

00:36:59.790 --> 00:37:00.570
Seam it up.

00:37:04.647 --> 00:37:07.420
And then we're going to
put this in rice flour.

00:37:07.420 --> 00:37:10.480
The rice flour just helps
it not stick to the basket.

00:37:10.480 --> 00:37:14.460
You can also totally
just put this in a pan.

00:37:14.460 --> 00:37:16.460
Then you don't need to
deal with the rice flour.

00:37:20.690 --> 00:37:21.582
Yeah?

00:37:21.582 --> 00:37:22.665
And then you let that sit.

00:37:22.665 --> 00:37:25.160
You can stick it in
your fridge and just

00:37:25.160 --> 00:37:26.600
get to it when you get to it.

00:37:26.600 --> 00:37:30.130
Or you can let it sit out
for three, four hours,

00:37:30.130 --> 00:37:32.730
and then bake it.

00:37:32.730 --> 00:37:38.200
And for the bake, what you want
to do is preheat your oven.

00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:44.380
450.

00:37:44.380 --> 00:37:47.310
If you're baking a loaf like
this, a free form hearth loaf,

00:37:47.310 --> 00:37:52.165
you want to have a
baking stone in there.

00:37:52.165 --> 00:38:01.022
Then this is-- I just can't
help but show you this part.

00:38:01.022 --> 00:38:02.480
You're going go
preheat that baking

00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:04.330
stone for 20, 30 minutes.

00:38:08.920 --> 00:38:15.840
And then you're going
to take your loaf

00:38:15.840 --> 00:38:20.110
and sprinkle the
top with some flour.

00:38:23.822 --> 00:38:26.390
Or you can use some
parchment paper as well.

00:38:26.390 --> 00:38:29.560
And now we're jumping ahead
in the process, right?

00:38:29.560 --> 00:38:32.990
You will have had to have
waited a few hours or overnight

00:38:32.990 --> 00:38:34.082
or after a day at work.

00:38:34.082 --> 00:38:35.415
And you're going to flip it out.

00:38:39.170 --> 00:38:41.591
It'll look prettier than this.

00:38:41.591 --> 00:38:44.400
And then you take
your razor, or lame--

00:38:44.400 --> 00:38:48.320
this is a double-sided
razor, very thin, very sharp.

00:38:48.320 --> 00:38:52.880
And you're going to
slash this sucker.

00:38:52.880 --> 00:38:53.670
All right?

00:38:53.670 --> 00:38:56.780
And this is very
exciting, when you--

00:38:56.780 --> 00:38:59.120
it's still very exciting
for me, still doing it,

00:38:59.120 --> 00:39:00.290
after all these years.

00:39:00.290 --> 00:39:02.850
But it'll be very
exciting for you.

00:39:02.850 --> 00:39:06.260
And it's a very subtle art.

00:39:06.260 --> 00:39:10.380
But it encourages
you to really, really

00:39:10.380 --> 00:39:12.880
tune in to this bread dough.

00:39:12.880 --> 00:39:17.490
And voila.

00:39:17.490 --> 00:39:21.630
[APPLAUSE]

00:39:21.630 --> 00:39:25.890
And so you bake for 20
minutes with a metal pot.

00:39:25.890 --> 00:39:28.710
So you take this, slide it
onto the hot baking stone,

00:39:28.710 --> 00:39:33.180
put a metal pot on
top, wait 20 minutes,

00:39:33.180 --> 00:39:35.750
take the metal pot
off, and at that point,

00:39:35.750 --> 00:39:37.420
the loaf will totally
have transformed.

00:39:37.420 --> 00:39:39.850
It will have
increased in volume.

00:39:39.850 --> 00:39:41.530
Probably won't
have changed color

00:39:41.530 --> 00:39:43.970
very much because it's been
baking in a steam saturated

00:39:43.970 --> 00:39:46.220
environment.

00:39:46.220 --> 00:39:47.800
But then when you
take that top off

00:39:47.800 --> 00:39:50.600
and you let it finish its
bake in a dry environment,

00:39:50.600 --> 00:39:52.930
that's where all that
delicious carmelization

00:39:52.930 --> 00:39:54.330
is going to occur.

00:39:54.330 --> 00:40:00.750
And I favor, encourage,
prefer a bold bake.

00:40:00.750 --> 00:40:03.502
It's that fifth principle there.

00:40:03.502 --> 00:40:05.710
Lots of people, if they
haven't had our bread before,

00:40:05.710 --> 00:40:08.813
they say, well you know, like,
I heard this place was great.

00:40:08.813 --> 00:40:11.311
And they burned all the bread.

00:40:11.311 --> 00:40:11.810
But no.

00:40:11.810 --> 00:40:14.510
We do it on purpose because
we think it tastes the best.

00:40:14.510 --> 00:40:17.610
It creates the most
delicious variation

00:40:17.610 --> 00:40:20.270
in texture between
the moist interior

00:40:20.270 --> 00:40:21.385
and a crunchy exterior.

00:40:24.020 --> 00:40:27.140
And yeah, pushing it
up to just shy of burnt

00:40:27.140 --> 00:40:29.260
is really what I prefer.

00:40:29.260 --> 00:40:32.435
And I think that
about covers it.

00:40:32.435 --> 00:40:32.935
IRFAN: Cool.

00:40:32.935 --> 00:40:33.643
That's fantastic.

00:40:33.643 --> 00:40:39.549
[APPLAUSE]

00:40:39.549 --> 00:40:41.090
Are you open to
taking questions now?

00:40:41.090 --> 00:40:41.590
JOSEY BAKER: Of course.

00:40:41.590 --> 00:40:41.900
Yeah.

00:40:41.900 --> 00:40:43.900
IRFAN: Does anybody have
questions in the group?

00:40:43.900 --> 00:40:45.692
We have a microphone.

00:40:45.692 --> 00:40:48.360
AUDIENCE: For the
metal pot technique

00:40:48.360 --> 00:40:51.160
you suggested, do you
preheat the pot before?

00:40:51.160 --> 00:40:53.555
IRFAN: The question is,
for the metal pot cooking,

00:40:53.555 --> 00:40:55.290
do you preheat the pot.

00:40:55.290 --> 00:40:56.700
JOSEY BAKER: You don't have to.

00:40:56.700 --> 00:41:00.040
I've done it both ways.

00:41:00.040 --> 00:41:03.790
And if you have a thin-walled
metal pot-- really,

00:41:03.790 --> 00:41:08.230
mostly what the metal pot is
doing is trapping the steam.

00:41:08.230 --> 00:41:11.110
Another way, which is
also totally awesome,

00:41:11.110 --> 00:41:15.420
is to do a Dutch
oven or a Le Creuset.

00:41:15.420 --> 00:41:19.730
And that makes the heat
blast it from all directions.

00:41:19.730 --> 00:41:21.780
And it traps the steam.

00:41:21.780 --> 00:41:25.660
That can be a little bit-- the
transfer of your unbaked loaf

00:41:25.660 --> 00:41:30.880
into the Le Creuset or the
Dutch oven can be really tricky.

00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:33.910
And I've screwed up
many a loaf doing that.

00:41:33.910 --> 00:41:36.290
Whereas the baking
stone, it's flat.

00:41:36.290 --> 00:41:39.840
So you just slide it on, take
that room temperature metal

00:41:39.840 --> 00:41:43.040
pot, put it on top,
and you're good to go.

00:41:43.040 --> 00:41:43.540
IRFAN: Cool.

00:41:43.540 --> 00:41:44.530
Any other questions?

00:41:44.530 --> 00:41:45.720
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:41:45.720 --> 00:41:49.470
If you're doing the method using
the sourdough, just the dough,

00:41:49.470 --> 00:41:52.570
at what point in the
process would that

00:41:52.570 --> 00:41:53.720
be the dough that you use?

00:41:53.720 --> 00:41:57.816
And how would it differ in
the new bread making process?

00:41:57.816 --> 00:41:59.650
JOSEY BAKER: It kind of depends.

00:41:59.650 --> 00:42:03.670
It depends on the activity level
of your dough, the temperature

00:42:03.670 --> 00:42:05.310
of your fridge, all that stuff.

00:42:05.310 --> 00:42:07.620
What we do is, we
take our dough,

00:42:07.620 --> 00:42:10.120
our whole wheat
dough, immediately

00:42:10.120 --> 00:42:11.505
after we're done mixing it.

00:42:11.505 --> 00:42:13.670
And so it actually has
salt in it as well.

00:42:13.670 --> 00:42:17.570
And we then have to divide
it up into smaller bits

00:42:17.570 --> 00:42:20.440
so that it can
cool down quickly,

00:42:20.440 --> 00:42:22.110
because if we took
30 kilos of dough

00:42:22.110 --> 00:42:23.610
and put it into the
fridge, it would

00:42:23.610 --> 00:42:25.020
take a long time to cool down.

00:42:25.020 --> 00:42:26.640
So we break it up
into little bits

00:42:26.640 --> 00:42:28.015
and put it right
into the fridge,

00:42:28.015 --> 00:42:31.920
and then use it 20 hours later.

00:42:31.920 --> 00:42:34.740
So-- say it again.

00:42:34.740 --> 00:42:36.780
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:42:36.780 --> 00:42:37.610
JOSEY BAKER: No.

00:42:37.610 --> 00:42:38.110
No.

00:42:38.110 --> 00:42:38.820
Yeah.

00:42:38.820 --> 00:42:40.046
And you can do that.

00:42:40.046 --> 00:42:41.420
It's really, you
know, every once

00:42:41.420 --> 00:42:45.560
in a while if we screw up and
like, accidentally throw away

00:42:45.560 --> 00:42:47.570
our starter or our old
dough, you could actually

00:42:47.570 --> 00:42:50.440
just take unbaked bread loaves.

00:42:50.440 --> 00:42:51.930
Like, you could
take any of these

00:42:51.930 --> 00:42:54.260
and use these as a
starter because it's

00:42:54.260 --> 00:42:55.740
all the same thing.

00:42:55.740 --> 00:42:58.160
It's flour, water, that
wild yeast and bacteria.

00:42:58.160 --> 00:43:01.890
The art of it is
catching your dough

00:43:01.890 --> 00:43:04.710
at the right phase in its
development after that fact,

00:43:04.710 --> 00:43:05.210
right?

00:43:05.210 --> 00:43:07.170
And I mean, obviously
that affects--

00:43:07.170 --> 00:43:11.510
like the development
of this dough

00:43:11.510 --> 00:43:15.757
is, it's pretty young to be used
as a starter for another dough,

00:43:15.757 --> 00:43:17.340
which is why we stick
it in the fridge

00:43:17.340 --> 00:43:20.438
and let it sit
there for a while.

00:43:20.438 --> 00:43:21.870
AUDIENCE: She's got a question.

00:43:21.870 --> 00:43:22.610
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:43:22.610 --> 00:43:24.990
I was reading Michael
Pollan's "Cooked."

00:43:24.990 --> 00:43:28.670
And in the bread section,
from what I understand,

00:43:28.670 --> 00:43:30.770
the whole milling
industry is really

00:43:30.770 --> 00:43:32.434
built around white flour.

00:43:32.434 --> 00:43:34.100
And wheat flour that
we buy in the store

00:43:34.100 --> 00:43:36.225
is really just white
flour with the germ

00:43:36.225 --> 00:43:38.450
and the bran added
back in afterwards.

00:43:38.450 --> 00:43:42.399
So where can we home cooks
get true wheat flour?

00:43:42.399 --> 00:43:44.065
JOSEY BAKER: You can
get it at The Mill.

00:43:47.920 --> 00:43:49.100
You can get it at The Mill.

00:43:49.100 --> 00:43:55.630
You can get it from-- you
know, it's a good question.

00:43:55.630 --> 00:44:03.040
I don't know of exactly
which large mills reliably

00:44:03.040 --> 00:44:08.410
produce whole grain flour that
hasn't been separated and then

00:44:08.410 --> 00:44:09.820
reconstituted.

00:44:09.820 --> 00:44:11.195
It's a very common practice.

00:44:14.475 --> 00:44:16.450
Another surefire
way, which is pretty

00:44:16.450 --> 00:44:19.820
impractical for most bakers,
but it's to mill your own flour.

00:44:24.090 --> 00:44:26.820
Yeah, I can't actually
give an answer

00:44:26.820 --> 00:44:29.160
that I'm totally positive
about on that front.

00:44:29.160 --> 00:44:31.820
Yeah, sorry.

00:44:31.820 --> 00:44:33.280
AUDIENCE: I had two questions.

00:44:33.280 --> 00:44:36.820
One was, when you
let your bread sit,

00:44:36.820 --> 00:44:41.140
or when you let your dough sit
a little bit-- like in the past,

00:44:41.140 --> 00:44:43.680
when I've let that happen, it
kind of gets a bit of a skin

00:44:43.680 --> 00:44:45.274
or like a kind of
dry skin on it.

00:44:45.274 --> 00:44:47.065
Is that just because
I haven't incorporated

00:44:47.065 --> 00:44:48.460
enough water in my dough?

00:44:48.460 --> 00:44:51.821
Or would that happen with
your technique or your recipes

00:44:51.821 --> 00:44:52.320
as well?

00:44:52.320 --> 00:44:54.300
JOSEY BAKER: At which
phase in the process?

00:44:54.300 --> 00:44:55.660
AUDIENCE: Like, at
the end of proofing.

00:44:55.660 --> 00:44:57.090
JOSEY BAKER: When you've
shaped it into a loaf?

00:44:57.090 --> 00:44:57.430
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:44:57.430 --> 00:44:58.846
JOSEY BAKER: Yeah,
so that happens

00:44:58.846 --> 00:45:00.390
because the moisture
in the dough

00:45:00.390 --> 00:45:02.260
is evaporating off of
the surface, right,

00:45:02.260 --> 00:45:04.340
and you're forming
a little skin.

00:45:04.340 --> 00:45:05.930
It's usually not a big deal.

00:45:05.930 --> 00:45:08.590
That happens sometimes in
the bakery, a little skin.

00:45:08.590 --> 00:45:12.450
A little skin on
the, when you've

00:45:12.450 --> 00:45:15.740
got your loaf in your basket,
a little skin on this side

00:45:15.740 --> 00:45:19.160
can actually be really helpful
because it makes the transfer

00:45:19.160 --> 00:45:22.760
into the oven a lot easier.

00:45:22.760 --> 00:45:24.700
But one thing you
could do-- you know,

00:45:24.700 --> 00:45:28.530
this depends on the
air flow in your fridge

00:45:28.530 --> 00:45:31.050
or wherever your
dough is sitting--

00:45:31.050 --> 00:45:32.050
but you can cover it up.

00:45:32.050 --> 00:45:34.720
You can put this inside
of a plastic bag.

00:45:34.720 --> 00:45:35.240
Tie the end.

00:45:35.240 --> 00:45:37.320
You could put it inside
of a container like this.

00:45:37.320 --> 00:45:39.640
I noticed really big
differences in the fridge

00:45:39.640 --> 00:45:44.740
that I had based on where I
put it in the fridge, right?

00:45:44.740 --> 00:45:48.030
Some areas are going to have a
lot more airflow than others.

00:45:48.030 --> 00:45:53.821
So you want it in a sort of
calm, draft-free environment.

00:45:53.821 --> 00:45:54.320
Yeah?

00:45:54.320 --> 00:45:57.654
AUDIENCE: And is the
steam pot, or the pot

00:45:57.654 --> 00:45:59.070
with the steaming
technique thing,

00:45:59.070 --> 00:46:01.720
is that enough to
give it a good crust?

00:46:01.720 --> 00:46:03.970
Because I know some
recipes will say, like,

00:46:03.970 --> 00:46:07.740
spritz your oven with water
to create a steam oven first.

00:46:07.740 --> 00:46:08.490
JOSEY BAKER: Yeah.

00:46:08.490 --> 00:46:11.596
So I've done a lot
of home oven baking.

00:46:11.596 --> 00:46:12.970
And the oven that
I was baking in

00:46:12.970 --> 00:46:14.594
at home when I started
selling my bread

00:46:14.594 --> 00:46:16.320
was not a fancy oven at all.

00:46:16.320 --> 00:46:20.570
It was in a little apartment
in the Mission, gas fired oven.

00:46:20.570 --> 00:46:24.910
And for a long time, because I
was baking 12 loaves at once,

00:46:24.910 --> 00:46:28.390
I couldn't bake them all on
baking stones with pots on top.

00:46:28.390 --> 00:46:30.030
I would do-- I'd
throw boiling water

00:46:30.030 --> 00:46:36.181
in the bottom of the oven, which
helps create a steam saturated

00:46:36.181 --> 00:46:36.680
environment.

00:46:36.680 --> 00:46:41.260
The problem is that your oven
is designed to let steam escape.

00:46:41.260 --> 00:46:46.570
So unless you trap it in there,
it's not going to be as good.

00:46:46.570 --> 00:46:49.280
So doing the oven within
an oven, whether that's

00:46:49.280 --> 00:46:52.360
with the Dutch oven, the Le
Creuset or a baking stone

00:46:52.360 --> 00:46:56.910
and a pot on top,
you can make bread

00:46:56.910 --> 00:47:00.860
that's as good as any
professional bakery.

00:47:00.860 --> 00:47:02.280
You really can.

00:47:02.280 --> 00:47:05.360
The only difference is that
the professional bakery

00:47:05.360 --> 00:47:08.800
can make hundreds,
thousands of loaves, right?

00:47:08.800 --> 00:47:10.680
But if you have
to make one loaf,

00:47:10.680 --> 00:47:15.070
your home oven is
totally capable.

00:47:15.070 --> 00:47:17.855
AUDIENCE: What are your views
on the gluten free movement?

00:47:19.670 --> 00:47:20.795
JOSEY BAKER: Good question.

00:47:24.240 --> 00:47:27.380
Well, I think it's
great that people

00:47:27.380 --> 00:47:31.550
are exploring different things
to help them feel better

00:47:31.550 --> 00:47:33.800
about themselves.

00:47:33.800 --> 00:47:39.570
And I think for
some people, eating

00:47:39.570 --> 00:47:43.120
less of particular types of
food makes them feel better.

00:47:43.120 --> 00:47:47.320
And that's awesome,
whatever it is.

00:47:47.320 --> 00:47:51.120
I think what we're seeing
now with gluten and bread

00:47:51.120 --> 00:47:55.700
and wheat is actually
really amazing

00:47:55.700 --> 00:47:59.950
because it's raising the
awareness about how bread

00:47:59.950 --> 00:48:02.680
is made, how wheat is grown.

00:48:06.220 --> 00:48:12.430
And I think what practically
everybody who actually explores

00:48:12.430 --> 00:48:15.140
that question is
going to find, is

00:48:15.140 --> 00:48:19.570
that it's actually not gluten.

00:48:19.570 --> 00:48:21.180
It's not wheat.

00:48:21.180 --> 00:48:22.860
It's not bread.

00:48:22.860 --> 00:48:26.380
It's certain types
of those things.

00:48:26.380 --> 00:48:26.880
Yeah?

00:48:26.880 --> 00:48:29.390
So I don't think the
question is, can I eat bread.

00:48:29.390 --> 00:48:32.409
It's, what type of
bread can I eat.

00:48:32.409 --> 00:48:33.450
If you want to eat bread.

00:48:33.450 --> 00:48:35.760
If you don't want to eat
bread, then by all means,

00:48:35.760 --> 00:48:36.390
don't eat it.

00:48:36.390 --> 00:48:38.490
Also, some people
have celiac disease.

00:48:38.490 --> 00:48:40.610
And they have a very
serious reaction to gluten.

00:48:40.610 --> 00:48:42.450
And I'm not questioning
that at all.

00:48:42.450 --> 00:48:47.160
But there is-- it's
a fad right now.

00:48:47.160 --> 00:48:55.760
And I've been really encouraged
by every single person who's

00:48:55.760 --> 00:48:58.510
written me an email or come
into The Mill and said, hey,

00:48:58.510 --> 00:48:59.930
I haven't eaten
bread in a while.

00:48:59.930 --> 00:49:03.090
But I hear that you have some
bread that actually doesn't

00:49:03.090 --> 00:49:05.010
bother people who
are allergic or who

00:49:05.010 --> 00:49:07.510
are sensitive to wheat
or to grain or to bread.

00:49:07.510 --> 00:49:08.740
And they eat our bread.

00:49:08.740 --> 00:49:11.160
And it doesn't
bother them at all.

00:49:11.160 --> 00:49:12.924
And why is that?

00:49:12.924 --> 00:49:14.840
Because the way that we
make bread and the way

00:49:14.840 --> 00:49:16.910
that I just taught
you how to make bread

00:49:16.910 --> 00:49:22.220
is totally different than the
way that most bread is made,

00:49:22.220 --> 00:49:24.570
which is made on a
really large scale

00:49:24.570 --> 00:49:28.090
in a really short amount
of time with ingredients

00:49:28.090 --> 00:49:30.800
that are mass produced.

00:49:30.800 --> 00:49:35.990
And nutrition is not
really on the radar, right?

00:49:35.990 --> 00:49:37.450
Or it's kind of an after fact.

00:49:37.450 --> 00:49:43.456
And it's sort of pumped
into it in weird forms.

00:49:43.456 --> 00:49:44.380
Yeah.

00:49:44.380 --> 00:49:46.740
So, does that?

00:49:46.740 --> 00:49:47.619
Yeah.

00:49:47.619 --> 00:49:49.660
We make a gluten free
bread, though, at The Mill.

00:49:49.660 --> 00:49:53.260
And for people who do have
a really serious sensitivity

00:49:53.260 --> 00:49:57.860
to gluten and to wheat, they
love that we offer that.

00:49:57.860 --> 00:50:02.530
And I'm really
proud to offer that.

00:50:02.530 --> 00:50:03.924
Yes sir?

00:50:03.924 --> 00:50:05.590
AUDIENCE: Could you
comment on the trade

00:50:05.590 --> 00:50:10.430
off in the texture and
flavor of the ultimate bread

00:50:10.430 --> 00:50:15.070
between the folding and kneading
every half hour that you

00:50:15.070 --> 00:50:18.890
demonstrated and a no-knead
method where you're

00:50:18.890 --> 00:50:21.190
relying strictly upon
time and fermentation

00:50:21.190 --> 00:50:22.450
to develop the texture?

00:50:22.450 --> 00:50:23.240
JOSEY BAKER: Yeah.

00:50:23.240 --> 00:50:26.110
So no-knead, for those
of you who don't know,

00:50:26.110 --> 00:50:29.570
is a totally awesome technique
that was popularized.

00:50:33.360 --> 00:50:35.160
It was an article in
the New York Times

00:50:35.160 --> 00:50:38.540
with Mark Bittman and Jim Lahey
from Sullivan Street Bakery.

00:50:38.540 --> 00:50:42.260
He's a really talented guy.

00:50:42.260 --> 00:50:46.680
And you can make an incredible
loaf of bread in your home oven

00:50:46.680 --> 00:50:49.570
with very little work.

00:50:49.570 --> 00:50:50.780
You don't need it at all.

00:50:50.780 --> 00:50:54.125
You just mix together the
flour, water, salt, little bit

00:50:54.125 --> 00:50:54.890
of yeast.

00:50:54.890 --> 00:50:58.200
You let it sit for a long time.

00:50:58.200 --> 00:51:01.222
Sort of flop it
into a round shape,

00:51:01.222 --> 00:51:02.930
let it sit for a little
bit, bake it off.

00:51:06.240 --> 00:51:09.160
I've tried that method
with more whole grain

00:51:09.160 --> 00:51:12.800
flours and haven't had
quite as much luck with it.

00:51:12.800 --> 00:51:14.950
I think that it's an
amazing method if you

00:51:14.950 --> 00:51:19.780
use primarily white flour.

00:51:19.780 --> 00:51:26.820
So if you're going
to use that method,

00:51:26.820 --> 00:51:28.195
I think you'll
have the best luck

00:51:28.195 --> 00:51:30.820
if you use mostly white flour.

00:51:33.390 --> 00:51:35.450
I'm open to hearing
other experiences.

00:51:35.450 --> 00:51:37.430
That just hasn't
been my experience.

00:51:37.430 --> 00:51:40.463
But that's also not
a sourdough bread.

00:51:40.463 --> 00:51:41.390
Yeah?

00:51:41.390 --> 00:51:46.550
And so with the
sourdough fermentation,

00:51:46.550 --> 00:51:51.930
you have to expel a little bit--
put a little bit more energy

00:51:51.930 --> 00:51:56.760
into the bread dough in
order to develop that gluten

00:51:56.760 --> 00:51:58.700
and have the type of
fermentation that's

00:51:58.700 --> 00:52:02.160
going to lead to a
delicious loaf of bread,

00:52:02.160 --> 00:52:06.002
rather than just leaving
it alone completely.

00:52:06.002 --> 00:52:06.710
IRFAN: Thank you.

00:52:06.710 --> 00:52:08.510
We have time for
one more question.

00:52:08.510 --> 00:52:10.400
And I believe the
microphone is right there.

00:52:10.400 --> 00:52:10.660
JOSEY BAKER: Hi.

00:52:10.660 --> 00:52:12.180
I was wondering if you
could talk a little bit

00:52:12.180 --> 00:52:13.800
from an entrepreneurial
standpoint what

00:52:13.800 --> 00:52:14.990
your journey was
like from, you know,

00:52:14.990 --> 00:52:17.190
I had this idea to bake
bread and sell it, to,

00:52:17.190 --> 00:52:19.092
I now have a mill and a bakery.

00:52:19.092 --> 00:52:19.800
And I sell bread.

00:52:19.800 --> 00:52:21.260
And also, what do
you do with the bread

00:52:21.260 --> 00:52:23.010
that you don't sell
at the end of the day?

00:52:23.010 --> 00:52:24.890
JOSEY BAKER: Yeah.

00:52:24.890 --> 00:52:29.780
Yeah, it's been a
pretty quick journey.

00:52:29.780 --> 00:52:33.450
And now, you know, I
think most of my energy

00:52:33.450 --> 00:52:38.090
is really spent on sort
of big picture stuff

00:52:38.090 --> 00:52:44.640
and the relationships that
exist, both within my business

00:52:44.640 --> 00:52:48.034
and with my businesses
and other businesses

00:52:48.034 --> 00:52:49.200
and our customers and stuff.

00:52:49.200 --> 00:52:52.300
So I spend a lot
of time thinking

00:52:52.300 --> 00:52:58.950
about those relationships,
which was a surprise to me.

00:52:58.950 --> 00:53:01.570
You know, I had no
idea that I would

00:53:01.570 --> 00:53:06.180
spend as much time on my
computer and in conversation

00:53:06.180 --> 00:53:12.410
with people when I decided
I was going to be a baker.

00:53:12.410 --> 00:53:20.660
But it's been, I think it was a
bit of a-- worked to my benefit

00:53:20.660 --> 00:53:26.910
how little I knew, because I
just kind of made things up

00:53:26.910 --> 00:53:28.090
as I went.

00:53:28.090 --> 00:53:34.340
And I didn't totally know how
difficult it was going to be.

00:53:34.340 --> 00:53:41.700
And I said yes to things
over and over again.

00:53:41.700 --> 00:53:47.180
And you know, I still sort of
am surprised when I look back

00:53:47.180 --> 00:53:50.160
on the last few years and
how much my day to day life

00:53:50.160 --> 00:53:54.640
has changed and how
the business has grown.

00:53:54.640 --> 00:53:57.220
But yeah.

00:53:57.220 --> 00:53:59.090
I'm really fortunate
to be able to say

00:53:59.090 --> 00:54:03.510
that I work with
an amazing group

00:54:03.510 --> 00:54:05.890
of passionate, talented people.

00:54:05.890 --> 00:54:15.107
And they make the best bread
that we know how to make.

00:54:15.107 --> 00:54:18.254
So, does that kind of
answer your question?

00:54:18.254 --> 00:54:19.360
IRFAN: Cool.

00:54:19.360 --> 00:54:19.860
All right.

00:54:19.860 --> 00:54:20.180
Thank you.

00:54:20.180 --> 00:54:21.365
This was an amazing class.

00:54:21.365 --> 00:54:21.620
JOSEY BAKER: Thank you.

00:54:21.620 --> 00:54:23.661
IRFAN: And it was really
great learning from you.

00:54:23.661 --> 00:54:25.540
So Josey Baker, everybody.

00:54:25.540 --> 00:54:26.140
Thank you.

00:54:26.140 --> 00:54:27.690
[APPLAUSE]
