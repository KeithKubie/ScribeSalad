00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:00.999
(whooshing)

00:00:00.999 --> 00:00:05.364
(mouse clicking)
(electronic chiming)

00:00:05.364 --> 00:00:07.947
(lively music)

00:00:09.194 --> 00:00:12.389
- [Narrator] We are the paradoxical ape,

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:14.889
bipedal, naked, large-brained,

00:00:17.579 --> 00:00:21.674
long the master of fire,
tools, and language,

00:00:21.674 --> 00:00:25.091
but still trying to understand ourselves,

00:00:25.961 --> 00:00:29.253
aware that death is inevitable,

00:00:29.253 --> 00:00:31.336
yet filled with optimism.

00:00:32.585 --> 00:00:34.913
We grow up slowly.

00:00:34.913 --> 00:00:37.513
We hand down knowledge.

00:00:37.513 --> 00:00:39.596
We empathize and deceive.

00:00:40.996 --> 00:00:42.053
We shape the future

00:00:42.053 --> 00:00:46.223
from our shared understanding of the past.

00:00:46.223 --> 00:00:48.443
CARTA brings together experts

00:00:48.443 --> 00:00:50.199
from diverse disciplines

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:53.248
to exchange insights on who we are

00:00:53.248 --> 00:00:54.915
and how we got here,

00:00:56.317 --> 00:00:58.032
an exploration made possible

00:00:58.032 --> 00:01:01.115
by the generosity of humans like you.

00:01:21.855 --> 00:01:24.605
(dramatic music)

00:01:27.557 --> 00:01:30.140
(lively music)

00:01:41.922 --> 00:01:45.922
- So I'm also very grateful
for this invitation.

00:01:47.027 --> 00:01:49.828
I haven't been this excited
about death for a long time.

00:01:49.828 --> 00:01:53.468
(audience laughing)

00:01:53.468 --> 00:01:57.940
So just to set the context
of my talk a little bit,

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:02.886
you'll remember when Dora
presented the baboon slides

00:02:02.886 --> 00:02:05.385
and the various questions
that we might ask

00:02:05.385 --> 00:02:07.489
of those baboons

00:02:07.489 --> 00:02:10.067
with respect to their
understanding of death.

00:02:10.067 --> 00:02:12.961
What I'll be telling you,
I think, in part today,

00:02:12.961 --> 00:02:15.442
is that the answer to
many of those questions

00:02:15.442 --> 00:02:17.657
with respect to children
at a fairly young age

00:02:17.657 --> 00:02:20.989
is yes, that they have an understanding.

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:23.682
But then I'll go on to say more

00:02:23.682 --> 00:02:26.185
about how that understanding

00:02:26.185 --> 00:02:28.768
might be displaced or amplified

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:33.736
by the notions of afterlife or religion

00:02:33.736 --> 00:02:38.332
that their particular
culture presents to them.

00:02:38.332 --> 00:02:41.733
So that's the gist of the presentation.

00:02:41.733 --> 00:02:43.513
Some acknowledgements here.

00:02:43.513 --> 00:02:44.979
My good colleague Rita Astuti,

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:48.640
whom you'll be hearing
more from this afternoon,

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.944
Marta Gimenez, with whom I
did some research in Spain,

00:02:51.944 --> 00:02:55.050
three colleagues at the
University of Texas,

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:56.077
I'll mention them later

00:02:56.077 --> 00:02:59.876
when I talk about some work in Vanuatu.

00:02:59.876 --> 00:03:01.293
So, as I've said,

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:05.077
children probably acquire,

00:03:06.114 --> 00:03:08.328
certainly by the age of seven or eight,

00:03:08.328 --> 00:03:10.674
have acquired what we might think of

00:03:10.674 --> 00:03:13.341
as a biological theory of death.

00:03:14.429 --> 00:03:16.781
That's to say they seem to understand

00:03:16.781 --> 00:03:19.492
that death is a terminal point

00:03:19.492 --> 00:03:22.438
for all mental and bodily processes.

00:03:22.438 --> 00:03:24.366
And indeed, children of this age,

00:03:24.366 --> 00:03:25.214
seven, eight, nine,

00:03:25.214 --> 00:03:28.717
it varies a little bit
from child to child,

00:03:28.717 --> 00:03:31.712
also seem to understand
the universality of death

00:03:31.712 --> 00:03:33.918
that it applies to everybody,

00:03:33.918 --> 00:03:35.835
that it's irreversible.

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:38.896
And it's also true that they understand

00:03:38.896 --> 00:03:41.758
something of the mechanics of death.

00:03:41.758 --> 00:03:45.175
That's to say that the body is a machine,

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:48.608
that there are various parts,

00:03:48.608 --> 00:03:52.204
invisible parts, lungs,
heart, and so forth,

00:03:52.204 --> 00:03:54.206
which have to be coordinated,

00:03:54.206 --> 00:03:56.704
and when those parts break down,

00:03:56.704 --> 00:03:58.433
then death is inevitable

00:03:58.433 --> 00:04:00.600
with various consequences.

00:04:01.811 --> 00:04:05.228
At the same time, children will encounter

00:04:06.873 --> 00:04:09.654
a religious account or
a supernatural account,

00:04:09.654 --> 00:04:11.096
and part of what I want to discuss,

00:04:11.096 --> 00:04:13.018
as I mentioned a moment ago,

00:04:13.018 --> 00:04:15.476
is the relationship in the child's mind

00:04:15.476 --> 00:04:18.109
between these two different accounts.

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:21.744
So in order to explore that question

00:04:21.744 --> 00:04:25.740
of the relationship
between the two accounts,

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:29.627
we, that's to say myself
and Marta Gimenez,

00:04:29.627 --> 00:04:33.380
tested children of five years of age,

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:34.741
sorry, seven years of age

00:04:34.741 --> 00:04:37.158
and 11 years of age in Spain.

00:04:38.703 --> 00:04:41.141
I mentioned Spain advisedly in some sense,

00:04:41.141 --> 00:04:42.514
because of course, these
children were there

00:04:42.514 --> 00:04:46.412
for growing up in a
particular religious culture.

00:04:46.412 --> 00:04:49.245
The children were not just quizzed

00:04:50.287 --> 00:04:52.287
about their, as it were,

00:04:53.273 --> 00:04:55.732
immediate or biological
conception of death,

00:04:55.732 --> 00:04:58.019
but we tried to prompt

00:04:58.019 --> 00:05:00.822
their religious conception as well.

00:05:00.822 --> 00:05:02.223
And we did this, therefore,

00:05:02.223 --> 00:05:06.152
in the context of two different stories.

00:05:06.152 --> 00:05:09.437
One about the death of a grandparent,

00:05:09.437 --> 00:05:11.924
and at the end of the story,

00:05:11.924 --> 00:05:15.091
the grandchild is visited by a doctor,

00:05:16.252 --> 00:05:19.254
and the other, also about
the death of a grandparent,

00:05:19.254 --> 00:05:21.370
but in this story,

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:24.989
the grandchild who's
lost their grandparent

00:05:24.989 --> 00:05:26.362
is visited by a priest.

00:05:26.362 --> 00:05:29.592
So I'll just show you those two stories.

00:05:29.592 --> 00:05:32.721
As you can see toward the end here,

00:05:32.721 --> 00:05:34.477
the doctor came to talk to Juan

00:05:34.477 --> 00:05:36.340
about what had happened,

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:37.211
and he said to Juan,

00:05:37.211 --> 00:05:39.347
"Your grandfather is dead now."

00:05:39.347 --> 00:05:43.410
You can see that there
is no hint in this story

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:45.125
of an afterlife,

00:05:45.125 --> 00:05:48.460
or there are no religious cues.

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:51.151
The second story, the priest's story,

00:05:51.151 --> 00:05:52.063
is fairly similar.

00:05:52.063 --> 00:05:56.149
That's to say, death of a
grandparent who's been ill,

00:05:56.149 --> 00:05:57.490
goes to the hospital.

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:00.062
But as you can see, at
the end of the story,

00:06:00.062 --> 00:06:03.710
Marta, the protagonist
is visited by a priest

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:05.234
rather than by a doctor

00:06:05.234 --> 00:06:07.965
who explains what has happened,

00:06:07.965 --> 00:06:11.410
and puts to Marta the claim that

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:13.340
her grandmother is now with God.

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:18.135
So each child listened
to both of these stories,

00:06:18.135 --> 00:06:19.885
and after each story,

00:06:20.906 --> 00:06:22.406
we would ask about

00:06:23.561 --> 00:06:26.644
the functioning of various processes.

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:30.691
Sometimes, we asked
about bodily processes,

00:06:30.691 --> 00:06:33.901
for example, have his
eyes stopped working?

00:06:33.901 --> 00:06:37.712
And sometimes, we asked
about mental processes,

00:06:37.712 --> 00:06:39.204
can he still see?

00:06:39.204 --> 00:06:42.187
And as in this case, we
tried to choose pairings,

00:06:42.187 --> 00:06:44.382
that's to say where we would focus in

00:06:44.382 --> 00:06:45.980
on a bodily organ

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:49.649
and an accompanying mental process.

00:06:49.649 --> 00:06:50.960
We couldn't always do that,

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:54.231
but roughly speaking, that was our goal.

00:06:54.231 --> 00:06:57.945
So ultimately, the children answered

00:06:57.945 --> 00:07:00.153
about 14 questions,

00:07:00.153 --> 00:07:02.469
seven about the functioning of the body,

00:07:02.469 --> 00:07:05.512
seven about the functioning of the mind.

00:07:05.512 --> 00:07:07.142
The children gave their reply.

00:07:07.142 --> 00:07:10.993
They would either say this
process was continuing or not,

00:07:10.993 --> 00:07:14.001
and then we would ask them
to offer an explanation

00:07:14.001 --> 00:07:16.519
of why it had stopped,

00:07:16.519 --> 00:07:20.352
or conversely, why the
process was continuing.

00:07:21.205 --> 00:07:25.361
And we found that we could
allocate children's answers

00:07:25.361 --> 00:07:27.861
to three different categories,

00:07:29.384 --> 00:07:30.859
religious, biological,

00:07:30.859 --> 00:07:33.561
and a more equivocal set of replies.

00:07:33.561 --> 00:07:35.480
So let's just present

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:37.381
the way in which we scored children

00:07:37.381 --> 00:07:39.799
for each of those categories.

00:07:39.799 --> 00:07:42.774
So religious answers, well, in this case,

00:07:42.774 --> 00:07:45.851
the child would claim that
a given process continues,

00:07:45.851 --> 00:07:47.934
so yes, he can still see.

00:07:48.923 --> 00:07:50.403
And then they, when we'd say,

00:07:50.403 --> 00:07:51.930
"Well, how is that?"

00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:55.294
They would supply a religious explanation.

00:07:55.294 --> 00:07:56.827
"In Heaven, everything can work

00:07:56.827 --> 00:07:58.776
"even if she is dead."

00:07:58.776 --> 00:08:00.359
"The soul keeps working," and so forth.

00:08:00.359 --> 00:08:03.942
So you can see very
clearly in these cases,

00:08:04.884 --> 00:08:07.566
references to religious notions,

00:08:07.566 --> 00:08:09.841
Heaven, the soul, and so forth.

00:08:09.841 --> 00:08:13.133
Now if we turn to the biological answers,

00:08:13.133 --> 00:08:16.250
here the child claims that
the process has stopped,

00:08:16.250 --> 00:08:17.185
and as you can see,

00:08:17.185 --> 00:08:20.288
they're pretty blunt about why it stopped.

00:08:20.288 --> 00:08:22.313
"He's been eaten by worms.

00:08:22.313 --> 00:08:24.342
"He has no body, he's just bones."

00:08:24.342 --> 00:08:26.205
"IF he's dead, nothing can work."

00:08:26.205 --> 00:08:29.659
And then finally, no credit answers,

00:08:29.659 --> 00:08:32.186
these were replies where the child

00:08:32.186 --> 00:08:34.759
either didn't offer an explanation

00:08:34.759 --> 00:08:36.506
or if they did so,

00:08:36.506 --> 00:08:38.314
it didn't seem to fit in with the judgment

00:08:38.314 --> 00:08:41.350
that they'd made about the process working

00:08:41.350 --> 00:08:43.278
or not working.

00:08:43.278 --> 00:08:44.418
So what I'm gonna do next

00:08:44.418 --> 00:08:47.335
is just show you the replies

00:08:47.335 --> 00:08:49.763
for the seven-year-olds,

00:08:49.763 --> 00:08:52.430
and just to give you a heads up,

00:08:54.861 --> 00:08:57.611
the biological answers are black,

00:08:58.527 --> 00:09:00.255
I mean the bars are black,

00:09:00.255 --> 00:09:03.386
the religious answers are white,

00:09:03.386 --> 00:09:06.738
and in between, you'll see
some gray for equivocal,

00:09:06.738 --> 00:09:07.738
so to speak.

00:09:09.136 --> 00:09:11.115
More than that, I'll show you the extent

00:09:11.115 --> 00:09:14.752
to which the child
offers religious replies

00:09:14.752 --> 00:09:17.759
or biological replies or equivocal replies

00:09:17.759 --> 00:09:20.676
with respect to those two story settings,

00:09:20.676 --> 00:09:24.354
remember the priest story
and the doctor story,

00:09:24.354 --> 00:09:26.873
and also within those two stories

00:09:26.873 --> 00:09:28.540
for mental processes

00:09:30.601 --> 00:09:32.847
versus bodily processes.

00:09:32.847 --> 00:09:34.368
So here's, as I say,

00:09:34.368 --> 00:09:37.073
an overview of the seven-year-olds,

00:09:37.073 --> 00:09:38.968
and you can see, it's fairly black.

00:09:38.968 --> 00:09:41.551
That's to say most of the time,

00:09:42.663 --> 00:09:47.262
the children are giving
biologically-oriented answers.

00:09:47.262 --> 00:09:50.100
And if you look at the
left-hand side of the figure,

00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:52.863
where I've charted replies

00:09:52.863 --> 00:09:55.519
for the doctor stories,

00:09:55.519 --> 00:09:58.153
whether it be about the body or the mind,

00:09:58.153 --> 00:10:01.620
you can see that biology is dominating.

00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:05.027
But if you shift over to
the two right-hand columns,

00:10:05.027 --> 00:10:07.676
you see that religion is beginning to

00:10:07.676 --> 00:10:09.571
get a look in, so to speak,

00:10:09.571 --> 00:10:11.585
more religious replies,

00:10:11.585 --> 00:10:15.398
and the proportion of
biological answers is declining.

00:10:15.398 --> 00:10:16.353
So in other words,

00:10:16.353 --> 00:10:18.332
when you present the same child,

00:10:18.332 --> 00:10:21.832
or, well, essentially the same child, yes,

00:10:23.638 --> 00:10:25.722
a story with some religious cues,

00:10:25.722 --> 00:10:27.327
they pick up on those cues

00:10:27.327 --> 00:10:30.410
and they start to interpret the death

00:10:31.370 --> 00:10:33.238
in a different context

00:10:33.238 --> 00:10:34.876
or in a different fashion.

00:10:34.876 --> 00:10:37.503
So that's the picture
for the seven-year-olds.

00:10:37.503 --> 00:10:39.691
Now we can ask what we will,

00:10:39.691 --> 00:10:42.608
might find with the older children,

00:10:44.005 --> 00:10:45.804
with the 11-year-olds,

00:10:45.804 --> 00:10:47.721
and the extent to which

00:10:48.579 --> 00:10:51.868
biology might, so to
speak, consolidate itself,

00:10:51.868 --> 00:10:55.485
or religion might consolidate itself,

00:10:55.485 --> 00:10:57.083
or there might be some competition

00:10:57.083 --> 00:10:59.286
between these two modes.

00:10:59.286 --> 00:11:01.091
And here's what we find.

00:11:01.091 --> 00:11:04.674
You can see that religion
is predominating,

00:11:06.876 --> 00:11:09.209
especially when we've given the child,

00:11:09.209 --> 00:11:11.935
as you see in the two right-hand columns,

00:11:11.935 --> 00:11:13.276
those afterlife cues.

00:11:13.276 --> 00:11:15.319
So if the priest is introduced,

00:11:15.319 --> 00:11:18.538
whether the child is asked
about the body or the mind,

00:11:18.538 --> 00:11:20.193
there's a lot of religious talk

00:11:20.193 --> 00:11:23.392
in their replies and justifications.

00:11:23.392 --> 00:11:25.809
So the next step that we took

00:11:27.124 --> 00:11:28.041
was to ask,

00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:32.284
given that we had presented each child

00:11:32.284 --> 00:11:33.701
with two stories,

00:11:34.633 --> 00:11:38.756
to ask how consistent any individual child

00:11:38.756 --> 00:11:41.700
might be across those two stories,

00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:45.298
and indeed, across
essentially the 28 questions

00:11:45.298 --> 00:11:47.798
that we had asked them.

00:11:47.798 --> 00:11:50.517
So at one extreme, a given child

00:11:50.517 --> 00:11:53.800
might be consistently
biological in their answer.

00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:55.640
They might assume that death is terminal,

00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:56.975
and that's that,

00:11:56.975 --> 00:11:58.202
no matter what the process

00:11:58.202 --> 00:12:00.795
and no matter what the story context.

00:12:00.795 --> 00:12:03.512
Conversely, they might
be consistently religious

00:12:03.512 --> 00:12:05.278
in their answers.

00:12:05.278 --> 00:12:08.572
And finally, we could
imagine an individual child

00:12:08.572 --> 00:12:10.348
who shifts their ground

00:12:10.348 --> 00:12:12.484
depending on the story context

00:12:12.484 --> 00:12:14.872
or indeed, on the particular process

00:12:14.872 --> 00:12:18.851
that they're being invited to think about.

00:12:18.851 --> 00:12:21.186
So you'll see in the next slide,

00:12:21.186 --> 00:12:22.795
again, these two age groups,

00:12:22.795 --> 00:12:24.493
seven-year-olds and 11-year-olds,

00:12:24.493 --> 00:12:27.099
but I'm gonna show you as
a proportion of children

00:12:27.099 --> 00:12:30.206
falling into these three categories.

00:12:30.206 --> 00:12:32.029
So here are the findings.

00:12:32.029 --> 00:12:34.094
So you can see that the seven-year-olds,

00:12:34.094 --> 00:12:37.369
as we might have suspected
from the earlier figure,

00:12:37.369 --> 00:12:41.974
approach death from a predominantly
biological perspective.

00:12:41.974 --> 00:12:44.745
On the other hand, if
you look at that red bar,

00:12:44.745 --> 00:12:46.967
we do see some proportion,

00:12:46.967 --> 00:12:49.424
about 30% of those seven-year-olds,

00:12:49.424 --> 00:12:50.432
who are mixing it,

00:12:50.432 --> 00:12:52.867
who go backwards and
forwards, so to speak,

00:12:52.867 --> 00:12:55.953
between the biological and the religious,

00:12:55.953 --> 00:12:57.607
and a small proportion

00:12:57.607 --> 00:13:00.334
who are consistently religious.

00:13:00.334 --> 00:13:02.166
Now if we turn to the 11-year-olds,

00:13:02.166 --> 00:13:03.919
we might have imagined

00:13:03.919 --> 00:13:07.684
that the consistently religious bar,

00:13:07.684 --> 00:13:09.037
the white bar,

00:13:09.037 --> 00:13:12.859
would be the one showing
the most sharp increase

00:13:12.859 --> 00:13:15.222
between the younger children
and the older children.

00:13:15.222 --> 00:13:17.783
That's not the case, as you see.

00:13:17.783 --> 00:13:19.125
What we do see is a decline

00:13:19.125 --> 00:13:22.870
in consistently biological responding

00:13:22.870 --> 00:13:26.826
and an increase in this
mixed pattern of responding,

00:13:26.826 --> 00:13:27.659
where the child,

00:13:27.659 --> 00:13:30.620
depending upon the particular
question we've asked,

00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:33.917
is inclined to offer a biological account

00:13:33.917 --> 00:13:36.108
or a religious account.

00:13:36.108 --> 00:13:37.752
More generally, I would say

00:13:37.752 --> 00:13:40.378
these data fitted into other data.

00:13:40.378 --> 00:13:42.295
It looks as if children

00:13:43.253 --> 00:13:47.420
by the age of late, middle
childhood, so to speak,

00:13:48.281 --> 00:13:50.471
have arrived at these two accounts.

00:13:50.471 --> 00:13:53.551
They don't necessarily
think of the two accounts

00:13:53.551 --> 00:13:55.678
as competitors with each other.

00:13:55.678 --> 00:13:58.928
They think of them as
compatible with each other.

00:13:58.928 --> 00:14:00.359
But it's also true,

00:14:00.359 --> 00:14:02.302
and this is going a little
bit beyond the data,

00:14:02.302 --> 00:14:04.264
but I think it's very plausible,

00:14:04.264 --> 00:14:06.221
that the starting point for young children

00:14:06.221 --> 00:14:07.509
is the biological.

00:14:07.509 --> 00:14:10.411
So they arrive at this biological account,

00:14:10.411 --> 00:14:13.132
of which, as I said earlier,

00:14:13.132 --> 00:14:16.136
by seven or eight, they
realize is a universal account

00:14:16.136 --> 00:14:18.460
and therefore, applies to themselves,

00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:20.270
and it may be that that's the foundation,

00:14:20.270 --> 00:14:23.102
ultimately, this biological account,

00:14:23.102 --> 00:14:26.368
for their increasing appreciation

00:14:26.368 --> 00:14:30.343
of the message that is offered
by religion, so to speak,

00:14:30.343 --> 00:14:32.759
which after all, in some sense,

00:14:32.759 --> 00:14:34.734
presupposes the biological account,

00:14:34.734 --> 00:14:35.819
but then denies it,

00:14:35.819 --> 00:14:38.486
which says death is not the end.

00:14:40.605 --> 00:14:44.739
So there's a sense in which,
from our point of view,

00:14:44.739 --> 00:14:48.574
we are seeing a somewhat paradoxical,

00:14:48.574 --> 00:14:50.540
conceptual development here,

00:14:50.540 --> 00:14:52.752
where conclusions that
the child has arrived at

00:14:52.752 --> 00:14:55.100
from a relatively objective point of view

00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:57.600
are going to be put aside or set aside

00:14:57.600 --> 00:15:01.142
in part by virtue of religious teaching.

00:15:01.142 --> 00:15:03.207
So there's a quick summary

00:15:03.207 --> 00:15:05.925
of what I've just reported to you.

00:15:05.925 --> 00:15:10.136
And as I've emphasized,
as children get older,

00:15:10.136 --> 00:15:13.476
this mixed stance is
the one that dominates.

00:15:13.476 --> 00:15:15.891
I'm going to give you a very quick taste

00:15:15.891 --> 00:15:18.999
of Rita's talk by showing
you a map of Madagascar.

00:15:18.999 --> 00:15:21.229
That's all I'm going to do.

00:15:21.229 --> 00:15:25.312
I'm gonna show you a
picture of her field site.

00:15:25.312 --> 00:15:26.944
She will tell you what happens

00:15:26.944 --> 00:15:29.915
when you go to Madagascar and you repeat

00:15:29.915 --> 00:15:32.015
this kind of interview

00:15:32.015 --> 00:15:34.317
with children and with adults,

00:15:34.317 --> 00:15:35.869
bearing in mind that in Madagascar,

00:15:35.869 --> 00:15:38.083
we're not talking about
a Christian culture,

00:15:38.083 --> 00:15:38.976
we're talking about a culture

00:15:38.976 --> 00:15:42.440
which believes in the
existence of the ancestors.

00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:46.261
So I'm gonna move on quickly
instead to Tanna, Vanuatu,

00:15:46.261 --> 00:15:50.957
as you can see, off the
east coast of Australia.

00:15:50.957 --> 00:15:53.974
And in particular, this island of Tanna

00:15:53.974 --> 00:15:56.956
is one where my colleagues in Austin,

00:15:56.956 --> 00:15:58.381
led by Christine Legare,

00:15:58.381 --> 00:16:01.638
have been doing these kinds of interviews

00:16:01.638 --> 00:16:06.175
with children, and indeed,
with adults in Tanna.

00:16:06.175 --> 00:16:09.925
Okay, they took essentially
the design study,

00:16:11.683 --> 00:16:14.891
the study design that I
described a moment ago

00:16:14.891 --> 00:16:15.808
to Vanuatu,

00:16:16.756 --> 00:16:20.506
but they also tested
adults in Austin, Texas,

00:16:21.583 --> 00:16:24.209
and the basic question was

00:16:24.209 --> 00:16:28.275
the extent to which we would
find a distinctive pattern,

00:16:28.275 --> 00:16:30.275
particularly in Vanuatu,

00:16:31.147 --> 00:16:32.690
or whether we would replicate

00:16:32.690 --> 00:16:35.640
the basic pattern we'd seen in Spain.

00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:38.718
One, it seems like a minor
methodological point,

00:16:38.718 --> 00:16:41.460
but I think it's of greater significance,

00:16:41.460 --> 00:16:43.248
in this particular study,

00:16:43.248 --> 00:16:47.650
each participant was only
presented with one story,

00:16:47.650 --> 00:16:49.506
not with two stories.

00:16:49.506 --> 00:16:50.339
So you could argue,

00:16:50.339 --> 00:16:53.016
looking back at the
results we got in Spain,

00:16:53.016 --> 00:16:55.935
that the reason why children
showed this duality,

00:16:55.935 --> 00:16:58.213
this coexistence of two accounts,

00:16:58.213 --> 00:17:00.582
was precisely because the two children

00:17:00.582 --> 00:17:02.025
had been presented

00:17:02.025 --> 00:17:05.139
with two different narratives about death.

00:17:05.139 --> 00:17:06.628
In this study then,

00:17:06.628 --> 00:17:08.616
each participant only got one story,

00:17:08.616 --> 00:17:10.605
and we'll see if nonetheless,

00:17:10.605 --> 00:17:13.938
we get this pattern of mixed responding.

00:17:15.530 --> 00:17:17.452
So that's the basic question.

00:17:17.452 --> 00:17:18.717
And I'm going to show you now the results

00:17:18.717 --> 00:17:21.322
that we got when we presented a story

00:17:21.322 --> 00:17:22.989
with afterlife cues,

00:17:24.102 --> 00:17:28.374
similar to the one that
I mentioned a moment ago,

00:17:28.374 --> 00:17:30.417
with respect to Madrid in Spain,

00:17:30.417 --> 00:17:31.870
but with certain cultural adjustments,

00:17:31.870 --> 00:17:33.370
given the culture,

00:17:36.215 --> 00:17:38.630
the two cultures, I should say.

00:17:38.630 --> 00:17:40.999
So here are the findings.

00:17:40.999 --> 00:17:44.240
Pretty straightforward as you can see.

00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:47.759
In both places, we see that
the consistently biological

00:17:47.759 --> 00:17:49.948
is in the minority.

00:17:49.948 --> 00:17:54.217
In both places, we do see some individuals

00:17:54.217 --> 00:17:57.636
who offer consistently
religious responding.

00:17:57.636 --> 00:17:59.715
But the very clear result

00:17:59.715 --> 00:18:03.174
is this prevalence of a mixed stance

00:18:03.174 --> 00:18:04.999
or mixed responding,

00:18:04.999 --> 00:18:09.245
both in the United States and in Vanuatu.

00:18:09.245 --> 00:18:11.033
So that leads me to, then,

00:18:11.033 --> 00:18:13.116
some overall conclusions.

00:18:14.689 --> 00:18:16.477
It looks as if, from our data,

00:18:16.477 --> 00:18:20.366
and actually, that's
echoed not just in Spain,

00:18:20.366 --> 00:18:22.936
but also in Madagascar,

00:18:22.936 --> 00:18:25.603
that young children don't really

00:18:27.446 --> 00:18:31.414
pay much heed to the religious narrative

00:18:31.414 --> 00:18:33.693
which is available in their culture.

00:18:33.693 --> 00:18:36.692
They come to an understanding of death

00:18:36.692 --> 00:18:38.359
in biological terms,

00:18:39.213 --> 00:18:41.939
and more probing interviews,

00:18:41.939 --> 00:18:44.331
and those I presented to you today

00:18:44.331 --> 00:18:46.631
suggest, as I mentioned earlier,

00:18:46.631 --> 00:18:48.197
that this is part of a theory

00:18:48.197 --> 00:18:49.336
in the sense that the children

00:18:49.336 --> 00:18:54.287
also can invoke various
unobservable bodily organs

00:18:54.287 --> 00:18:57.301
and realize that the body is coherent

00:18:57.301 --> 00:18:59.384
or has to work coherently

00:19:00.512 --> 00:19:02.600
for life to continue,

00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:04.321
and when life stops,

00:19:04.321 --> 00:19:07.640
you see a termination of most processes.

00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:11.351
So children have established that notion

00:19:11.351 --> 00:19:13.998
by around seven or eight years of age.

00:19:13.998 --> 00:19:17.498
As that theory or account is consolidated,

00:19:18.548 --> 00:19:20.681
it seems as if they become more receptive

00:19:20.681 --> 00:19:22.951
to the existing theological,

00:19:22.951 --> 00:19:25.173
supernatural, or religious account

00:19:25.173 --> 00:19:27.590
that exists in their culture,

00:19:29.730 --> 00:19:31.103
but having said that,

00:19:31.103 --> 00:19:32.867
it's not as if that religious stance

00:19:32.867 --> 00:19:35.729
leads them to forget or suppress

00:19:35.729 --> 00:19:37.886
what they know about biology.

00:19:37.886 --> 00:19:41.361
So what you see among
large numbers of people

00:19:41.361 --> 00:19:43.274
in all of these populations

00:19:43.274 --> 00:19:47.093
is a tendency to oscillate
between the two accounts.

00:19:47.093 --> 00:19:49.843
And to the best of our knowledge,

00:19:51.395 --> 00:19:54.146
these two accounts are not perceived to be

00:19:54.146 --> 00:19:55.935
in conflict with one another,

00:19:55.935 --> 00:19:57.397
and I think Rita will present you

00:19:57.397 --> 00:20:01.822
with more ethnographic
evidence this afternoon

00:20:01.822 --> 00:20:04.638
that indeed, people move rather smoothly

00:20:04.638 --> 00:20:07.308
from one account to the other.

00:20:07.308 --> 00:20:09.595
Now let me just try to
say one or two words

00:20:09.595 --> 00:20:12.418
about the broader implications then

00:20:12.418 --> 00:20:15.639
of these developmental findings

00:20:15.639 --> 00:20:18.323
for more comparative approach

00:20:18.323 --> 00:20:22.872
that we will be reviewing
in the course of today.

00:20:22.872 --> 00:20:24.549
So these developmental findings

00:20:24.549 --> 00:20:26.344
may or may not point to

00:20:26.344 --> 00:20:29.108
what happened in the
course of human history,

00:20:29.108 --> 00:20:32.369
and they may or may not point to

00:20:32.369 --> 00:20:36.449
ideas that we can bring to
primatology in particular.

00:20:36.449 --> 00:20:37.385
Could it be that primates

00:20:37.385 --> 00:20:40.324
have some minimal
biological understanding,

00:20:40.324 --> 00:20:43.004
and should we assume that

00:20:43.004 --> 00:20:44.919
the religious notion, of course,

00:20:44.919 --> 00:20:46.917
would ultimately, in the human species,

00:20:46.917 --> 00:20:49.120
build on that biological notion,

00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:53.223
which is already hinted
at in our close cousins.

00:20:53.223 --> 00:20:54.194
Let me stop there.

00:20:54.194 --> 00:20:55.027
Thank you.

00:20:55.027 --> 00:20:58.194
(audience applauding)

00:20:59.934 --> 00:21:02.517
(lively music)
