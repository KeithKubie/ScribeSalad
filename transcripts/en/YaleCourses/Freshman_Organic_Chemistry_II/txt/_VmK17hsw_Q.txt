Speaker 1:          00:01          Okay. So we've been talking about alkenes and they're polymerization. And now we'll go onto the triple bond analogs, the settled liens for just a little bit, and then onto a conjugated system, starting with Al Alec, intermediates, and then die jeans. And then in general about linear and cyclic conjugation and aero materiality. So we can generalize from what we know about Alkenes to uh, settled liens. We have the same kinds of reactions, additions of Hbr, addition of water, addition of h two. But all of these have a little bit of a different twist. A HBR, we already mentioned this, but I'll go over it again, the stepwise edition, but Mark Kaufman to cough the addition of water. We see the possibility of Quito enal to automatism and regio selection as in alkenes. Uh, and then in h two, there's a question of a stepwise edition, one double bond, and then the other one multiple bond and than the other.

Speaker 1:          01:04          And the question of Stereo selection. And finally, uh, some stuff about acidity and base catalyzed, I saw memorization of a settled liens, which you'll see are much more acidic than alkenes are. Okay. First we talked about this already, but just to go over it quickly, once again, uh, it's possible to add HBR to a triple bond, like one heck sign. And you can use a catalyst that helps make the HBR more acidic and you can get a single addition to give the heck scene to Bromo one heck scene. And you often use an inhibitor so that you don't get free radical addition of Hbr. Now we mentioned before it was a hundred to a thousand times slower than the comparable ionic addition to the alkene. And the reason is the vinyl cad ion is not so great at an intermediate. And you can see that already in gas phase ionization of the chlorides, the one that gives the ethyl cad ion, uh, requires only 193 kilocalories per mole to ionize the chloride.

Speaker 1:          02:06          But the, uh, vinyl compound to make the vinyl cat ion requires another 32 kilocalories per mole. It's hard to make the vinyl cad. I am so that, that's what of course you make when you added the proton to the, to the, uh, hexine. And it's possible to isolate that in 40% yield, which seems funny as we mentioned before because if it's so if it's not very reactive wouldn't the hexane you make be even more reactive so that it would be impossible to isolate something that was part way along and the so you can go further to to to dive Romo Hexane. Uh, obviously it's slower and it gives a second Markovnikov addition. Right, which if the Bromo substituents slows the addition to an alkene in order to make it slower than the initial addition to the already slow alcaide. Why is the or orientation Mark Kaufman the cough and we saw the resolution to that riddle a few lectures ago that the halogens do two things.

Speaker 1:          03:09          They elect, they withdraw electrons through the sigma bond and therefore make it harder to form the cad ion. But if you formed the cad ion, make it next to the halogen so that at least you can profit from stabilizing the unshared pair on the halogen. Okay. We saw that before. Now hydration and hydrogenation of Al kinds. First hydration, we can do the same kind of thing. We did the before the ALC, oxy mercury nation, which you may remember, forums, an unsymmetrical bridged ion, then water can open it up and you get the addition of mercury in Oih, hydroxy mercury or Asian. Now remember what we did before when this was an alkene to begin with and we had a single bond in the product. Nobody wants the mercury compound. What do you do? What, why did people make it?

Speaker 2:          04:04          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          04:05          the next step was reduction. Remove the mercury and replace it with age so that what you added was effectively water. Right? So they used sodium borohydride to do that. However, it doesn't wait around for you to do that under these conditions because you have acid there. And with the double bond, it's possible for the acid to, uh, to add to it now. Uh, so you get that cat eye on what's good about that cat I in? Why is that easier to form than it would have been if it had just been irregular? Alkene Lisa,

Speaker 2:          04:49          what does the o have to do with it? Uh,

Speaker 1:          04:57          no. Well they're a double bond. Gets farmed, rolled him lately. But what's good about the cad ion when you have the oxygen next door, Brandon, what do you say?

Speaker 2:          05:09          Yeah, it has

Speaker 1:          05:09          unshared electrons in the P orbitals that can be stabilized by the vacant p orbital next door. So that there's a resonance structure that makes it unusually stable. A Homo Lumo interaction. But what leaves then is the mercury plus.

Speaker 2:          05:25          Okay,

Speaker 1:          05:27          so you get this compound, which is an Ian Ole, it's noticed that it was formed with Markovnikov orientation as it would have been the case if it started with an alkene. Right. But enols can undergo this same acid catalyzed reaction to get that cat ion, which is stable as we can see in that resonance structure. And what could that do?

Speaker 2:          05:54          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          05:56          well, who's a proton? Okay, so it gives a key tone. This is, this got traditionally the name Quito, Ian, all Tao Tom Terrorism. Tau Tau means equivalent to, right. So the idea was that the ketone and anal inner inner converted so easily that it was impossible to isolate one or the other. So that's a really easy alcoholic rearrangement from one end of the, from one alley lake position. To the other. Okay. And we talked about about the Keto enol equilibrium last semester when we were talking about bond strings. Just to remind you, this is where we went through it, added up the bonds and showed that the ketone is much more stable than the Ian all, I'll just flip through that. That's just a, so when you're reviewing it, you can look at it there. Okay, so it goes to the ketone. So the product from hydration of the of an Al kind is not, is a ketone.

Speaker 1:          06:53          Okay, I'll Coxy mercury ration of an Alpine. You don't, doesn't wait around to do the sodium borohydride reduction. Now remember you could do the other thing and an alkene add in the other Riggio chemistry by using a boring, for a settled liens, you use a special Bahrain which has a VI. What you get, you get a vinyl, boring is the product and it won't add a second time if you have those are prime groups sufficiently hindered so that it's so that it blocks access. Okay. Away you can do that is with a compound called die. Same Old Boring, uh, which is made with Bh three and that alkane. So you might think about what the r groups are. They are prime groups that you put on there to make that hindered one with a single age that an ad's only once. So you get that vinyl boring.

Speaker 1:          07:43          And what do you remember what you did with, with boranes when we were added to a double bond? What was the next thing? Hydro duration. And then what incidentally, this reminds me that a week from today is, uh, we have another exam, right? And it'll cover at today's and Wednesdays lectures. I'll give a review session Wednesday evening. I'll tell you it probably eight to 10. Uh, and um, uh, so you have a week to learn this stuff. That's good news. Okay. Anyhow, in the, it was hydro ball ration, oxidation was the next thing. Remember you treated it with hydrogen peroxide and alk oxide to make the a boring into an alcohol. Right. And then, uh, in this case we have a, uh, an anal as above. So that'll I summarize to a carbonyl compound. But notice it was anti Markovnikov addition above was mark [inaudible] the oxygen went to the more substituted center.

Speaker 1:          08:47          This one, the trick you use when you do boring the the o goes to the less substituted center. So in that case you get an Aldehyde. So the h two on one carbon and the oh on the other ad in one sense here and in the opposite sense here. So that's nice because if you're a synthetic chemist that gives you the control of which product you want to get, you can use one method to get the Markov knockoff ketone and the other to get the anti Markovnikov Aldehyde. So this is hydration with either Riggio specificity but also we could talk about hydrogenation adding h two and here it's a question of stereo specificity up at the top there. If we take a an alpine and reduce it with h two and a catalyst as we talked about with an Alkene, uh, you can get first this alkene and you use a special catalyst.

Speaker 1:          09:44          This is called, was developed by a guy named Lyndon lar and he added, led to the, to the palladium catalyst. Led is a poison for catalysts. You makes the, it makes the catalyst less active. Why might you want the catalyst not to be very active, Chris? So it doesn't go all the way. It'll do the acetylene but it won't do the Alkene so you can stop and get it there. If you use a more reactive catalyst, you can go all the way. Okay, so that deactivates the palladium and stops at the alkene stage and notice the two hydrogens came in from the same side, so it's a sin addition. For example, you get a 97% of that sin addition. If the are, is this ch two taken three times ester group. Okay. Now on the other hand, if he use sodium and ammonia a thing called a dissolving metal reduction, you get the opposite stereo specificity.

Speaker 1:          10:43          It's an anti edition right? Now it might wonder that the sin addition we talked about before, it's the same thing in an alkene about how the Palladian comes in and attack. Then it gets replaced by one hydrogen and buy another hydrogen always front side attack so that it comes out to be sin. That one won't surprise you. But why does this one give Auntie? Uh, the key is that it's a dissolving metal reduction. Incidentally, in that case with and propyl groups, it's an 80 to 90% yield of that anti edition. And I think none of the sin. Okay. So it's a dissolving metal reduction. So sodium actually dissolves in ammonia to give electrons and sodium plus. So it's a very interesting I and pair, it's an electron and sodium ions. Of course the electron is solved aided by, by ammonias around and about it, and it looks blue. The solutions of electrons. Okay. Now if you have an acetylene, an electron will add to it. What? Orbital. We'll go into what's, what's the Lumo going to be? [inaudible] what do you say?

Speaker 1:          11:56          Yeah, high star. So notice it puts in, there already is a, uh, a pair of electrons in that corresponding pi orbital. So now you have three electrons among those two p orbitals. So you can write it as one being an an I n with two electrons and the other being a radical with the third electron. Okay? So we have an anti on radical as an intermediate. That of course is a very strong base, the carbon and iron, so it can react with the ammonia and pull off a proton, right? So we've added an electron and a proton that's the equivalent of adding a hydrogen atom, although it's done as two stages. Okay, so we get this a vinyl radical, which is bent,

Speaker 2:          12:41          right?

Speaker 1:          12:43          Their sp squared hybridized at that functional carbon, but they invert easily in the case of a radical right? So it goes back and forth between the, the RB on the same side and the opposite side. Now which one do you think is favored? Obviously the one with the art groups on the opposite side. So at equilibrium, that's the one you have. And now a second electron comes along and goes into that singly occupied orbital. So now you're going to have a pair of electrons there. We'll write the minus charge in that sp squared, hybridized orbital, but now it's harder to invert. Remember x h three how he, how if you added bore electrons, it ceased to be plainer and became pyramidal. The same idea here. So now it doesn't flip back and forth rapidly.

Speaker 2:          13:31          Uh,

Speaker 1:          13:33          so a second proton can be taken away from the ammonia.

Speaker 2:          13:39          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          13:39          And we get that product and the two H's are on opposite sides. It's an anti edition. Why auntie? It's because the, that, that isomerization of the radicals favored the one with the RS far apart from one another. Then it got trapped as the anti on in that geometry and then it went on to give the anti product as we and gave yields of on the previous slide. Now the final special thing about Al kinds that we're going to talk about is their acidity and how that relates to isomerization of Al kinds. So we looked before at these PKA values for, for a carbon nitrogen, oxygen in the order you would expect them to be, but that if you have an sp squared hybridized carbon or an sp hybridized carbon, they get much more acidic.

Speaker 2:          14:33          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          14:37          We talked about this before, and in some cases, if you have next door, uh, if you're breaking a ch bond and next door, there's a double bond you can get, uh, you can get a extra acidity. Okay? That stabilization. Okay. So anyhow, we looked at those PKA is, and here we can see, uh, the energies of these, uh, three isomers of an Alpine. So you have the Alpine on the left. The lowest energy is heavily substituted on the far right is one that it's the end of the chain. So not being, uh, not having as many, uh, carbon carbon bonds with a special sp hybrid. It's not as stable. And in the middle we have the dying version, the one to dying. So at equilibrium, you would strongly favor the, the internal acetylene. But how do you establish and equilibrium among these, you have to move hydrogens around.

Speaker 1:          15:37          So at equilibrium, given those energies, there's only 0.1% of the one to die [inaudible] and 0.03% of the terminal acetylene. So very little of those. Okay. So we just talked about the fact that that the Acetyl, that the terminal acetylene could be, or the internal acetylene could be acidic because of the Pi bonds next door making the anti and more stable. So deed you could do that or you could, you could do this one that was on the previous slide as well. Or You could do the terminal acetylene, which is the easiest one to take off to put the electrons in the low energy sp hybrid orbital. Now the PKA over here is 38 so that means that the KIA is 10 to the minus 38 right? Or the energy involved in getting up there is about 51 kilocalories per mole. Okay. Over on the right, it's 33 kilocalories per mole.

Speaker 1:          16:38          Still way up hill, right? So those energies are quite far above the, we know this, that's what we know from the pks. So if we wanted to take off a proton and then put it back on and take off a different one, put it back on and finally go to the final and ion, we'd have to go way up and energy. If you have to go up 51 kilocalories per mole, that's not a very fast process. The rate constant for that would be 10 to the 13th per second times 10 to the minus 38 or the halftime would be about 10 to the 17 years, which is about 10 to the fourth times the time that's elapsed since the big bang. So don't wait around for that one to happen. Okay? So obviously you're not going to be able to isomerize that way by just letting it ionize off of Proton.

Speaker 1:          17:26          But if you put hydroxide in, it reacts with the Proton to make water and that's worth 21 kilocalories per mole. Remember the PKA is 16 uh, four thirds of 16 is a is 21 so 21 kilocalories per mole. So that makes it 21 kilocalories easier to make the ani. And because you're not making proton, you're making water. Okay? So that's going to lower these, is that going to do the trick to be able to isomerize? Well now it's half time would be about 30 years at room temperature. Okay. But if you warmed it to 150 k it would be about two minutes. So if you heat it up, you could make the, the uh, I saw memorization occur and then no matter which of these you start with, it's going to equilibrate. And this is the lowest energy form. And that's going to be everything except there's going to be 0.1% here and 0.03% there.

Speaker 1:          18:29          Okay? So no matter which of these you start with, you're going to get that. However, suppose you use a really strong base like amid, so now the, that favors a loss of a proton. That is, it'll take the proton by 45 kilocalories per mole. So now we're going to lower those ions even further like that. And notice what happens on the far right. It goes all the way down there. And that's now the lowest energy forum. If you have Nh two minus. So instead of having it be all here, which is what you're going to have in any equilibrium among the neutral forms, right? This is going to be the lowest energy form, right? So everything will be over there. 7.2 kilo calories down, which means that at equilibrium you're going to have only 0.01% of this stuff, which was always the favorite stuff before.

Speaker 1:          19:25          So everything is now over here. So the trick is now you neutralize it very rapidly. Right? So the trick to obtain a terminal acetylene remember that an eye on is the one that has the, the anti and on the last carbon. That's why it's such a stable an ion cause it's sp hybridized. So you equilla break with an amid base in an amine solvent to form the terminal an eye on. Then you quench it by adding water to donate a proton to the terminal and I and and also to the R and, h. So you have only hydroxide now, which is too weak to allow equilibration or if you want to, you could just add acid so that you don't even have, Ooh, they're all of, that's gilding the lily. You've already made it by not having that really strong base. So you stopped the equilibrium, you'd put the Proton on the terminal acetylene so you could go from the internal, the more stable when usually to the terminal acetylene using this trick.

Speaker 1:          20:25          Okay. So that's all I wanted to say about, about uh, settled liens. And now we're going on for the next, uh, these two lectures and a little bit probably still beyond the exam to talk about conjugation and Aram [inaudible]. So conjugated Pi Systems is what you're talking about. The name conjugated comes from an interesting route that conjugated systems, or when you have pi bonds separated by a single, a single bond and they're called conjugated because there are yoked together. The word yoke is the same root. It's a yolk comes from younger ray from Yougo on which is to join, right? So they're joined together. They don't act independently. We talked about this already in the first exam and we may mentioned when you've memorized functional groups and on the, on the exam, I had a thing that had both the carbon eel and an amine and they were near one another.

Speaker 1:          21:25          But it's not a car video group and an amine group. It's an amid group, they are conjugated and they behave in their own special way. So now we're going to talk about a conjugation. So conjugation is where the localized orbital picture, which is, uh, which remember we've talked so much about pairwise to Adam's coming together to give a bond and an anti bond or isolate at the Tommy core bundles. That was our intermediate between hydrogen, like atomic orbitals, which we really understood. We had a table that we can draw them out and the Computer Mos, which looked very complicated, but in, in between where these pairwise things, right? But sometimes we have to think more deeply when these things are conjugated and they don't behave that way. Okay. So when does conjugation make a difference? So first we're gonna look at experimental evidence and then we're going to go into the theory.

Speaker 1:          22:19          So a classic example is Alec Stabilization. Allie will comes from the word, the same as I only or l and French meeting garlic. There's a, a sulfide in garlic, uh, that, that has an owl, a double bond than a carbon bumble bond, single bond, and then the functional group assault side. So that's an alcoholic sulfide came from garlic, right? So Allie ill is these three carbons in a row, double bond, single bond. So you can get special stabilization when you have functional groups involved. When you have a intermediates involved, they're like the cat eye and intermediate. So the energy for pulling off a chloride for a primary and secondary are these values in the gas phase? Of course, very hard to separate the ions, but if it's Alec, it's as good as being secondary. Right? So Al Lily because very good, right? Or if you look at anti and look at the PKA of the Oah here at 16 we know if you have a double bond here, falls by uh, by six orders of magnitude, right?

Speaker 1:          23:25          And then the case where it's an oxygen here, it falls by another five orders of magnitude than you actually call it an acid. Okay. So the anti is getting much more stable when they're out allelic by about eight kilocalories per mole in the case of the, of the eternal. Okay. Or free radicals. If you look at the bond energy of a normal ch bond hundred one. But if you make a double bond next door so that this is Al Lilly, it's 89, it's stabilized by about 13 kilocalories per mole. So there's stabilization of these reactive intermediates when their ally lake. Okay. Now let's look at some more detail about some of these. Like the cat I an intermediate, the addition of Hx to Butte to dying. We talked about HX, a halogen acids add into single double bonds. How about add into two double bonds. Okay, so it might have 78 degrees.

Speaker 1:          24:20          You can add HBR to Buda dying and you could imagine the h plus going on one of the internal carbons to generate that cat ion. Or it could go on the terminal carbon, the other Riggio chemistry and generate that cat eye. And uh, which of those do you think is more likely to get, which one would you prefer if you were the proton I Asia, the lower one. Why? First it's, it's secondary and it's also a little lake, right? Which the first one isn't because from this, from this carbon to the double bond, there's an intervening saturated carbon, right? It's not two double bonds or two, uh, two sets of p orbital separated by a single bond. There's no overlap between this p orbital and that p orbital. Okay? So this was the second one is of course also that because those are resonant structures, but as I used to tells us the top one doesn't look so good, so we're going to get one of those.

Speaker 1:          25:18          But then in a second step we add bromide, right? If we do that at minus 78 degrees, of course we generated the bromide when we attack the Proton. Uh, so, uh, we could imagine getting those two forms by attacking this, uh, this intermediate, this intermediate, which is denoted by two resonance structures. Uh, now in fact, you get those in the ratio, 80% to 20%. Um, does that surprise you? What would you expect for the, for the ratio of these two here you have a terminal double bond. Here you have an internal double bond, which one is more stable? Do you like to have double bonds, more substituted or less substituted? Arvin, do you remember more substituted? So this is backwards, right? It's four to one in the wrong direction. Now that means that if you allow it to equilibrate, it'll go the way our of and wants it to, right?

Speaker 1:          26:20          But the initial product formed it really low temperature. It dry ice temperature is backwards. Okay. Uh, you can cause this, this in fact can, can ionize to make the, to make, go back to the cat I and then come back and that, that's a root for equilibration between these two. And you can encourage the bromide to come off by putting ferric bromide if you want to. It'll go faster. But at any rate, that's the equilibrium. So this is called kinetic versus thermodynamic control. So thermodynamic his equilibrium. But kinetic is what you get first. And those aren't necessarily the same. It's this case we've seen before where you start and you go up a certain rate and then down to a product. Or You could go to a more stable product. Hammond would say you'd go faster to the more stable product, but sometimes remember it crosses and it's easier to get to the, to the, uh, to the less stable product. And that's example here. It's a kinetic controlled under at low temperature. Now, why, why, when it's a question of rate the first one to be formed. Why do you think you formed the top one? Anybody got a theory?

Speaker 2:          27:36          Yeah. How's it church? What about the positive charge?

Speaker 1:          27:46          Right? It looks like this is a sec. This is a secondary versus primary, more of this. So that's where at attacks, that looks like a good explanation and that's what you'll see in almost all textbooks. So very good on a rock. You can write a textbook. Okay, let's look at the, let's look at the orbitals that are involved in this just for fun quickly. Okay, so here's a top view down on the four p orbitals of the [inaudible]. And here's the side view, right? So here's the homo minus one. That's the favorable combination of those four p orbitals.

Speaker 2:          28:22          Okay.

Speaker 1:          28:24          And here's the homo. That's the unfavorable combination. It's Pi on this side, Pi on this side, but unfavorable between them. Okay? That's the homo. The Lumo has two nodes among the four P orbitals. And what do you think the Lumo plus one looks like?

Speaker 1:          28:43          It's got three nodes. So you got no nodes, one node, two nodes, three nodes, okay. For combinations among Lewis P orbitals. Now the homo is the one you want to attack with the, with the Proton. Okay? So where should you attack it? Probably you get the best overlap around in there, right? Or You could look at how the, the, the uh, potential on the surface that we've talked about to see where the best place for a proton is and it's in the orange region. So that's, that seems to more or less agree. It's about there. So that's where the Proton should attack at the terminal, uh, at the terminal carbon. And then it would give the pro penal cad I ion, right? Which is shown here. There are three hydrogens on this carbon here. Okay? So that's the best product then. Okay, now that's the, the homo minus four. It's a little bit silly to look at that, but it's a ch bond that's hyper conjugated a little bit with the [inaudible]. Now we have three P orbitals here, here, here. The one that was here became part of this ch bond. Okay. Now. How about the rest of them?

Speaker 2:          29:55          Okay,

Speaker 1:          29:56          here's the homo. It's the pie. Here's the Lumo one node. And here's the Lumo plus one, two nodes among those three p orbitals. Okay, so that's the pro penal cad. I am, uh, there's the Lumo that, that you're going to want to attack if you're the bromide, right? So you could attack at either end, not at the middle.

Speaker 2:          30:21          Okay.

Speaker 1:          30:23          And if you look at the surface potential, uh, the, the worst place for, uh, uh, a proton, uh, uh, is where it's very blue here. So that would be the best place for bromide to come, but it's in the plane of the ring. It's not a place you can form a bond.

Speaker 2:          30:45          Okay? Okay.

Speaker 1:          30:49          If you're willing, if you want to come in from the top where you can form a new bond, it's a little bit green there and a little bit blue, even better there. So the blue place plus 144 would be the best place to attack if you want to form a bond, that's where bromide would tend to be in order to attack. So one would think that that this is exactly what honor Rog has proposed, right? That it should attack there. But here's a really interesting paper that was published in 1979 where what's being added to his, not Buda dying, but Penta dying another methyl group on there. So they add DCL, which adds to the end to get the, as one would expect to get the more substituted Al Lilly [inaudible]. Right? But now there's something interesting about that that's symmetrical except for the fact that there's a deuterium there, right? So if a bromide now comes in, or in this case they use chloride, it could attack either here or here, right? If it attacks here, you get the one, two edition d and cl. If at attacks here, you get one for edition d and CS.

Speaker 2:          32:01          Okay.

Speaker 1:          32:03          Now if it had to do with, with the kind of thing we talked about before, where's the best place to put a chloride? Where do you get the best overlap and so on? That's the same here and here. Right? So it should be 50 50 in this case, because of the intermediate being symmetrical. When it was beauty to die and we didn't have this methyl group and it was unsymmetrical and we did the analysis of the previous slide where it would be the best place to attack, but now it's symmetrical. So we should get 50 50. So here's the product distribution done at a bunch of different solvents at different temperatures. And just look at a couple of these. If you do it at room temperature at 25 degrees, you get a, you get a half. Again, as much of this as you do have this more chloride ads here than here. And if you do it at low temperature, you'll get three times as much addition here as here, even though it's symmetrical. So we've got to find some other reason why when we do this, the chloride tends to attack here rather than here. One, two addition rather than one for addition. Canadian buddy gets a reason for that.

Speaker 1:          33:16          Well, let's look at the mechanism. The first thing that happens is the, we put a proton on and generate the, this uh, cad ion and also chloride. Now do you have an idea?

Speaker 3:          33:30          That's good.

Speaker 1:          33:32          Hi Alicia. It's closer, it has to move farther to get to one four because this backside attack on the hydrogen meant that the chloride has to be out here someplace closer to this end then to this end. Right. So it appears that rapid collapse of this ion pair that you made before they could I and could move independently and established true symmetry that competes so that the collapse competes with the motion that would make a truly symmetric. So it looks like it might not have anything to do with where the charges on the surface or which resonance structure is better. Right? It's just where the chloride got formed, ended at attacks really quickly when the eye pair of collapses. So you had, you could have written a textbook but you might not have been. Right.

Speaker 1:          34:26          Okay. Now, uh, Lle transition states also are unusually stable and we actually mentioned this before, but if you look at the, uh, an sn one reaction, so you're breaking away to get a cat eye on, uh, the, the relative rates are if you take a hundred for t butyl, which is very easy to form the t butyl cat eye, and the secondary is, is, uh, 10 to the fourth times slower and the primary just doesn't happen. It's way slower than that. Okay. But if it's how lily, then it's five, five times faster than secondary, even though you might think it would be primary. Right? And if it's Allah Lake with a methyl group on it to make the cat eye and more stable that you're forming, when you break off chloride, it's, it's, it's all half as fast as a tertiary t butyl chloride. If you put two methyl groups there, it's, it's very much faster.

Speaker 1:          35:16          63 times faster than t butyl. Right? And if you put a methyl group here, however, on this carbon that is, so we've put a methyl group here, it accelerates enormously. If we put two Bethel groups there, I really accelerates if we put a methyl group here. However, on the other end of the, or pardon me, down in the middle w wait a second. No, I, I had a, my game here, sorry if we put it on the other end is just as good. Okay. But this is what I wanted to tell you. If you put the methyl group in the middle, it doesn't help at all.

Speaker 1:          35:52          So the methyl group has to be on one end or the other of the cad I and you're gonna make when you lose the chloride, right? In order to get that acceleration, if you put it in the middle, it doesn't help. So again, we could look at the, where the charge is in the cad ion and you have to put the math for the methyl to be effective and accelerating it in an accelerated. The sn two reaction. Sn One reaction. It has to be where the charge is going to be. Now how about sn two. Okay. If we take the rate of of uh, ethyl chloride to be one reacted with f oxide, it's 37 times faster. If it's Alec at 97 times faster. If you put a methyl lawn and 560 times faster, if you put two methyls on right, if you put the methyl in the middle, it, it, uh, it doesn't help compared to the compared to not have it in the methyl. But if you put a Bethel at this end, remember before when we were doing sn, one forming the cat died. We could put it either at this end or this end and got the same right now it's slower here. Any idea why it should be slower in this case for the sn two how about the rate of t butyl for sn? Two

Speaker 1:          37:12          pft. Butyl three. Methyls and you want to do sn two very hindered, right? So this hinders the approach because you're a member, you're making a pentavalent carbon in the transition state. So Al Will Lake helps, but this time you can get help from the math at this end, but not at this end. Okay. Now another. So we looked at the alley cat ion, we looked at the transition states and Barb in form involved in forming the cad ion and in the sn two process. Now let's look at the alcoholic and ion. And that's easy, easily done by looking at the acidity. So we have a PK of something like 52. It's hard to measure for that, but if you have, it's alcoholic, it's 43 right? And that's helped by a nine powers of 10 are about 11 kilocalories per mole of stabilization for losing that Proton at equilibrium.

Speaker 1:          38:09          And if you have a been a federal ring there in what's called, it's been Zelig and now it's even more so about 16 kilocalories per mole. So again, having these pie things where they can overlap with the, an eye on that's being formed is a very favorable, the order of 10 or 15 kilocalories per mole. Okay. How about free radicals? Well, here's a very interesting, uh, these figures came out of this paper by Ziegler. This Siegler is, is not the Seigler who teaches Kevin to 20. This is the one who invented Ziegler, not a polymerization. And that became quite wealthy. Okay. So, uh, so in 1942 working in Germany at the Second World War, he was studying this process, he could get a 58% yield of, of substitution. This is this bro emanation as a substitution pulling off one of these hydrogens and replacing it by bromide.

Speaker 1:          39:04          Okay, now heat for this purpose. The paper that describes this describes this particular calm, proud, which is called [inaudible] sucks and emod. Right? And in the, in ether solve it in 30 minutes using light. What is the fact that he was using light? Suggest that it might be a free radical chain reaction, right? He was able to get this 58% yield. Now what's an brought, where does he get the, and Bromo sucks. Inhibit. So that compound is succinic acid. Hey, he reacted it with base to make the ad ion. Does it surprise you that that ad I could be formed with hydroxide? Remember, and h has a pka of in the of a 30 or something like that and hydroxide is only a 16 at the PK of water. How is it able to pull off that Proton? What's good about that? And I, and that we formed

Speaker 4:          40:02          Megan, do you have any idea can stabilize,

Speaker 1:          40:10          right? Yeah. To Carbondale. Pi Stars to sets that stabilize the high energy electrons are this nitrogen. Okay. So you could make that out iron, but it can, uh, that the PK, incidentally that is 9.5 it's a very strong, uh, acid as Nh bonds go. And that could do an sn two reaction on a br two to put, brought me in on the nitrogen and make the burrow, my dad and I, and together with the sodium ion that came from hydroxide. So that's how he got NBS. But you can take it apart again if you, instead of using base use acid, so if you, if you use Hbr, you can protonate this, you could protonate that oxygen or they could draw a resonance structure here like that. So it's easy to protonate here, but now you can take the burl bide and do an sn two reaction on the Br.

Speaker 1:          41:01          Right? So you generate this now neutral, right, which is an even or that easily I saw him rises to back to the starting material. So base you could make this with burl mead and if you add HBR, you come back, right? And of course also get br too. That was what was formed here. So you can get the br two back again if you want to from NBS. Now back to the reaction. Uh, we could imagine doing a reaction of br two with a double bond. What reaction have we talked about? Br plus a double bond.

Speaker 1:          41:43          It's the addition electrophilic addition to a double bond, right? We talked about this a good deal. No doubt it will be covered on the exam next Monday. Okay, you do this here at room temperature in the dark. You hit the bro Ammonium ion first. Remember how we talked about that? And then you get anti audition. Okay? Now, but suppose you want to do substitution. That's what Ziegler dead, right? He didn't add bro mean to the double bond. He replaced an aloe lake, hydrogen with bromine. So those substitutions are typically free radical substitutions. So you could have this same compound, but I show the hydrogens, because if you have ways to get a free radical, like a bromine atom, it can pull off. Get HBR. I had this, but remember, we use bromine here, not chlorine because it's slow and selective. So if you use chlorine, uh, it also takes not only this hydrogen, but also this hydrogen almost this rapidly.

Speaker 1:          42:42          It's not selective, but bromine is selective. It's uphill, okay? Then you can react it with br two and replace, uh, where the hydrogen is with bromine. So you've done alkylate Brahman nation, and of course the, uh, uh, this, this alcoholic intermediate was resonant of this farm. You could have put the bromine either here or here. So you also get that, which is the same material in the case shown. But if you had a substituent, it would be in a different position. If you had something on the ring substituted here, it would be a different compound. Okay? And it also gives a bromine atom. Why is that relevant? What happens to the bromine atom?

Speaker 2:          43:25          Math,

Speaker 5:          43:26          it gets reused. Theoretical chain. It goes back.

Speaker 1:          43:30          Let's start. It's a chain reaction. Okay, so how do you control what you're going to get? Are you going to get bromine, bromine edition or alcoholic substitution? Right? Can you think of any way of controlling which of these you put bromine in? Which of these things is going to operate?

Speaker 2:          43:50          Okay?

Speaker 5:          43:50          Is there a way any handle you have on it? Matt can use photo initiation to get the rat if you use notice this one? Yes,

Speaker 1:          43:57          it's done in the dark. Right? If we don't, if we can't get the radical, we won't do this one. Okay, so one, I want ideas to keep it in the dark, right? Don't use the initiator. Okay. Now suppose we want, so that'll allow us to do this one, that dark one. How do we get this one to happen? Well, you might say we use light or using initiator, right? But this can still happen. If you have the light on, you can still get that right. It doesn't require dark. It's just this one requires light. Okay, so this one would also be going on but another way, which is to minimize the concentration of br too. Now why does that have anything to do with it? This is a really interesting thing about the kinetics of the top reaction, right? It's second order in br too. That looks really weird. Why do you need two molecules of bromine in order to do this?

Speaker 6:          44:59          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          45:00          The reason is that you want to make, when you get the Br plus coming on, br minus is coming off from br too. So you have to get br minus and in fact br minus is stabilized by reacting with Vr too to give br three minus. So in fact what happens is that the br, the second VR two helps the bromide leave from br plus in a non polar solvent like this, right? So it's second order. So that means if you, if you have a really low concentration of br to this one gets really slow because it's a bad leaving group, right? It's like make, making the BR minus leave by putting br two in is like making Ooh lead by putting a proton on it. Make it a better leaving group. Okay, so we want to, if we minimize the concentration of br two will slow this one down.

Speaker 1:          45:55          But that reaction with VR too is very fast. Remember the first step of this is is endothermic is slow, but that's step is really fast. Okay. So we can tolerate a low concentration of br for this purpose. But how are you going to do it? Right? Cause suppose you'd put in just a TD about have just a teeny amount of br two there. Okay. This starts in, but quickly you've exhausted the br two and now the radical chain stops. Right? And that's the end of the line right now you could say, I'll just, I'll, I'll, I'll very carefully run in br to very slowly, right? Just to balance out. But when you put a drop in, the bromine concentration is higher in that drop locally, right? So you're going to get this reaction because of the local high concentration of br too. Right? But this is where it Siegler comes in with his clever NBS molecule. This looks like it's tedious to impossible to maintain a really low concentration of br too, while it's being consumed all the time. But notice that this reaction also yielded Hbr, right? Whenever that happens. And if we have envy and Bravo [inaudible] sucks in amid plus Hbr, that's the reaction we looked at on the previous slide that destroys and Bromo sucks. Cinnamint takes it back to succeed him it. And remember what the other product was.

Speaker 6:          47:27          Okay. B

Speaker 1:          47:30          R two. So isn't this neat? Whenever a br two bollock tool gets used up, a new br two molecule is created by this reaction, right? So it automatically maintains the minimum possible concentration of br too. Every time you use it, you get a new one. You don't have to sit there with your bureaucrat trying to run it in very slowly. So that's the trick with an Bromo sucks and emit now. So we've looked here at a lot of different Alec stabilizations, right? But dining's can also be conjugated. And how much is that worth? Okay. We can look at the heat of combustion of this one, which where they're not conjugated, and this one where there's across across a single bond, these isomers of one another, and you can see that it's the conjugation seems to be worth about seven kilocalories per mole or down here it seems to be worth about eight kilocalories per mole.

Speaker 1:          48:27          But these numbers, all of their claimed to be very precise, are big numbers, right? And that I think that precision might be a little bit overstated, right? If you look at the heat of hydrogenation, that heat that's given off, when you add h two then you can see that these are all 30 I'm going to let you go after you make two guesses. Okay, now guess what? It should eat this double bond. The stove on this double bond, they all give off 30 kilocalories per mole of heat. How much should this one give off when you hydrogenate both double bonds.

Speaker 2:          49:04          16 lean. How about this one now, how about this one? Something bigger.

Speaker 1:          49:25          So conjugation, this one is more stable. It doesn't give off as much heat, right? And it seems to be stable by about four kilocalories per mole. Okay. Now you can go.
