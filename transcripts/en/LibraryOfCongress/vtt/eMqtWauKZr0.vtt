00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:06.640
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:09.340
&gt;&gt; R. J. Palacio: I will say
that if you've read my book,

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:12.540 position:56%
you know that it's about a
10-year-old boy named Auggie Pullman

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.000
who was born with a very
severe craniofacial difference,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.430
which makes him the subject of
many stares, and social cruelties,

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.180
and an easy target for bullies.

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:26.930
He's singled out because
of what he looks like.

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:29.400
But, despite the unkindnesses
that have been hurled

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:35.390
at him his whole life, Auggie
himself is incapable, or unwilling,

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:38.590
to resort to unkindness himself.

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:41.360
Instead he greets the
world with the courage

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.930
of his own inherent kindness.

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:46.990
He fights cruelty with humor.

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:50.220
He meets ignorance with grace.

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:54.580
The reason he's a wonder isn't
because of the 27 surgeries,

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:57.100
or because he looks so different.

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.980
He's a wonder because despite
every reason to distrust the world,

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.150
he marches into it with a
brave heart, and a ready,

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.340
if not easy-to-fathom smile.

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:15.030 position:56%
That's why readers around the world
have taken Auggie into their hearts.

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:20.600
He reminds them that kindness
is what makes people great.

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.300
If Auggie Pullman can be kind
despite everything he's been

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.980
through, if he can
find that kindness

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:32.880
within him, so can everybody.

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:38.910
Let's see, what else I
can say from this speech.

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:42.710
I will also just add, since
I'm here in Washington.

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:47.740
I am the daughter of immigrants.

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:50.380
I'm a first-generation American.

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:54.380
My parents didn't know any
English when they came here.

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.440
My first language, my
mother tongue, was Spanish.

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.840
I'm completely bi-lingual.

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.310
And, I'm the product of
a public-school education

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.290
in a blue-collar neighborhood
in Flushing, Queens.

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:11.500
In fact, where my best
friend growing up,

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.190
Meg Medina [assumed spelling],
is in the audience, too.

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.100
She grew up there as well.

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.190
[ Applause ]

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:22.580
I will also add, I grew
up a 15-minute drive away

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:25.280
from where Donald Trump grew up,

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.550
but we had very different
childhoods and upbringings.

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:35.500 position:56%
I was taught by my immigrant
parents to value art and literature.

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:41.040
I was taught by my father to
marvel at the wonders of science.

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.760
I was taught by my
mother to revere books.

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.720
I was taught by my teachers
to value the ideas of others,

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.780
even if they were different
from mine.

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:54.060
You know, that saying, I may
not agree with what you say,

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.270
but I will fight to the
death your right to say it.

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:00.690
That is at the heart
of American values.

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:05.080
I was taught by my neighbors,
even those who weren't thrilled

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:09.370 position:56%
at having Latinos in their
neighborhood, that class has nothing

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:13.510
to do with income, and
everything to do with outcome.

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:18.240
[ Applause ]

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:24.330
I'm telling you these things
just to explain what it feels

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:29.170
like to hear our president announce
legislation that would bar people

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:33.920
like my parents to immigrate
here legally, to this country,

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:36.100
because they don't know English.

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:39.590 position:56%
Please understand the outrage I feel

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:47.390
when I see white supremacists decry
my right to live here and be here.

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:50.490
Please understand my dismay
at leaders and pundits

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:54.340
who don't denounce
Nazis and the KKK.

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:57.080
Please understand my
disappointment in the people

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:02.230 position:56%
who say they love my book's message,
but nevertheless defend policies

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:05.790
that hurt real-life Auggies.

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:09.020
It's incompatible.

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:14.360
I will tell you a little-- just
a very, very small anecdote

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:18.350
about a family that I've become
really, really good friends with.

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:21.470
They have a son who has
Treacher Collins syndrome,

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:23.680
and when I met this boy,
it's like, I thought,

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.860 position:56%
oh my goodness, this is like Auggie.

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:27.160
A real-life Auggie.

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:30.430
He looked exactly the way I
imagined Auggie looks like.

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:35.420
And, during the healthcare
debates of last month,

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:37.110
I got this text from the dad.

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:43.380
And, he's like, I've been crying
all night, because if this happens,

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:45.570
you know, Nathaniel
[assumed spelling] will--

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:51.790
he's like, tapped out, he's
maxed out of his life-time cap.

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:54.290
I mean, I don't know
what we're going to do.

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:55.660
There're real life Auggies.

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:58.200
There are kids who are born
with physical ailments who need,

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:03.790
and need us to fight for them,
and so, how do we do that?

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:05.090
Do we march?

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:06.390
Do we protest?

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:07.690
Do we write?

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:09.400
And, the answer is
yes, yes, and yes.

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:11.720
But, more than anything we vote.

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:16.140
We have to choose kind, we have
to vote kind, and I'm not talking

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:20.740
about voting in national
elections only.

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:24.020
I'm talking about voting
in local elections.

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:28.410
Voting for school board
people who believe in science.

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:32.680
I'm talking about voting
for Congressional people,

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:38.080
state legislators, who, you
know, who advocate and will fight

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:40.090
for the things that you
want and believe in.

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:43.860 position:56%
Because the state government affects
national government much more

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:45.160
than we know.

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:48.880
So, with that, I will end and
will say that I'm so sorry

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:52.440
that I've turned this into
sort of, a sermon on kindness.

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:56.780
But, I just feel like if you
give me, you know, a pen to write

00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:58.800
about something, I
write about kindness.

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:01.810
And, if you give me a soapbox
to talk about something,

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:06.060
I'm going to talk about kindness.

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:08.490
So, right now, we have 10 minutes.

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:11.570
I'm happy to answer
any questions you want.

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:18.500
I'm happy to change the subject,
and talk about anything you want.

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:21.620
Are there-- oh, there we go.

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:22.920
Hi there.

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:31.020 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Where did you get the inspiration
for the character Summer?

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:32.320
&gt;&gt; R. J. Palacio: Summer.

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:33.620
That's such a-- because
everyone loves Summer.

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:35.220
Summer's one of my
favorite characters.

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:38.700
And you know, I would say first,
that almost all the characters

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:44.760
in Wonder, are based, kind of, on
like, mashups of people I know.

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:50.190
So, Auggie himself is kind of, a
mashup between my son when he was

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:53.690
that age, and his best
friend, and Jack Will,

00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:56.680
for instance is also a mashup
of two boys, two brothers,

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:59.040
one was named Jack, the
other was named Will.

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:02.500
Summer is the only one
that is actually based

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:06.590
on a real little girl I
knew who was named Summer,

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:09.220
who was the nicest
little girl I'd ever met.

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:12.640
She was so sweet and kind, and
I used to say to her mother,

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:14.410
it's like, oh my God,
she's so amazing.

00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:17.710
And, the mother would say, I know,
it's, you know, it's you know,

00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:20.910
sometimes, you know, we
have kids, and they're like,

00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:22.800
better than anything
we've ever, like,

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:24.710
been able to do, you know, raise.

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:30.310
And, this little girl, Summer,
was truly a remarkable young lady.

00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:31.970
Next. Yes.

00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:34.930
&gt;&gt; Hi. First off, I want to say
thank you so much for your writing.

00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:36.230
&gt;&gt; R. J. Palacio: Oh, thank you.

00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:38.410
&gt;&gt; I teach fifth grade and
we read your book every year,

00:07:38.410 --> 00:07:41.120
and it's opened up so many
conversations about empathy

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:43.460
and compassion in our
classrooms, so thank you so much.

00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:44.760 position:56%
&gt;&gt; R. J. Palacio: Thank you so much.

00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:46.570
&gt;&gt; I wanted to ask
you, what are some

00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:49.500
of the most inspiring actions
you've seen children take

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:51.940
after reading Wonder?

00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:54.780
&gt;&gt; R. J. Palacio: You know,
I think for me, personally,

00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:59.520 position:56%
one of the best things about writing
Wonder is hearing stories like that,

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:03.290
and just hearing-- getting so many
emails, unfortunately too many

00:08:03.290 --> 00:08:07.450
to respond to, of things
that kids have been inspired

00:08:07.450 --> 00:08:09.240
to do after reading Wonder.

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:13.280
I almost can't think, you know,
everything from raising money

00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:18.980
at lemonade stands for Operation
Smile, to visiting hospitals

00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:22.840
that specialize in facial
reconstruction for young kids.

00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:27.640
My favorite though, came very, very
soon after Wonder was published.

00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:31.680
Where, let's see how quickly
I can tell this story.

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:36.050
There was a little boy whose
mother was the president

00:08:36.050 --> 00:08:39.750
of the Children's Craniofacial
Foundation, and she has a blog.

00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:42.030
And, her little son,
Peter [assumed spelling],

00:08:42.030 --> 00:08:44.330
was a big fan of Wonder early on,

00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:47.380
and he wrote a little guest
blog post for his mom,

00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:50.140
talking about all the ways
he was like Auggie Pullman.

00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:52.080
Like Auggie Pullman, he
had a facial difference.

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:54.280
Like Auggie Pullman,
he needed hearing aids.

00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:56.990
Like Auggie Pullman, he
had an October birthday,

00:08:56.990 --> 00:08:58.960
like Auggie Pullman,
he loved Star Wars.

00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:00.850
But, then he said,
unlike Auggie Pullman,

00:09:00.850 --> 00:09:02.920
I've never had a standing ovation.

00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:06.240
Somewhere across the country,
there was a class of fifth-graders

00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:09.910 position:56%
who were reading Wonder, and I guess
they came across this blog post.

00:09:09.910 --> 00:09:13.680
And then, they sent him, Peter,
this little boy they'd never met,

00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:17.100
a video of themselves
saying, you know, Peter,

00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:18.540
we heard that you like Wonder.

00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:21.340
We like Wonder too,
and this is for you.

00:09:21.340 --> 00:09:24.990
And then, they filmed themselves
giving him a standing ovation.

00:09:24.990 --> 00:09:27.710
That was when-- I mean, I remember
opening that email, showing--

00:09:27.710 --> 00:09:29.680
I was still working in my
office, and we all were,

00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:31.050
like, crying at that email.

00:09:31.050 --> 00:09:32.360
So, I think that was
one of my favorites.

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:35.350
There have been so many,
though, so it's been great.

00:09:35.350 --> 00:09:36.650
Yes?

00:09:36.650 --> 00:09:39.320 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Did you get to meet Daveed Diggs?

00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:40.850
&gt;&gt; R. J. Palacio: I did!

00:09:40.850 --> 00:09:46.340
It was so cool, and even more,
my kids got to meet him too,

00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:51.590
and they're huge Hamilton fans,
and that was-- and it's so funny,

00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:55.750
let me just say to all the
grownups in the room, I mean,

00:09:55.750 --> 00:09:58.330
I was floored when
I met Julia Roberts.

00:09:58.330 --> 00:10:00.050
For my kids, it was
all about Daveed Diggs.

00:10:00.050 --> 00:10:05.810
And, also Mandy Patinkin,
Inigo Montoya, you know?

00:10:05.810 --> 00:10:07.200
That was big.

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:08.680
So, yes.

00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:10.070
&gt;&gt; What does your--

00:10:10.070 --> 00:10:13.530
&gt;&gt; R. J. Palacio: Oh, sorry,
I think you're next, yes.

00:10:13.530 --> 00:10:15.650
&gt;&gt; OK. So first, I
just want to thank you

00:10:15.650 --> 00:10:17.350
for kind of, an obscure reason.

00:10:17.350 --> 00:10:21.520
I first read Wonder when I
was 11, and when I saw, like,

00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:24.210
the random little part about
Via reading War and Peace

00:10:24.210 --> 00:10:26.360
when she was 15, that
kind of inspired me.

00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:28.020
And, I just finished
it, like, a month ago,

00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:29.410
and it's the best thing
I've ever read,

00:10:29.410 --> 00:10:31.190
so thank you very much for that.

00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:32.490
&gt;&gt; R. J. Palacio: Thank you!

00:10:32.490 --> 00:10:34.210
Thank you, I am so
thrilled to hear it.

00:10:34.210 --> 00:10:35.660
Isn't it the best thing, ever?

00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:38.350
I read it when I was your age.

00:10:38.350 --> 00:10:41.490
People say, oh, is a 15-year-old
going to read War and Peace?

00:10:41.490 --> 00:10:43.780
I did. And, it is so good.

00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:47.650
It is not hard, it's
like soap opera stuff.

00:10:47.650 --> 00:10:49.950
I mean, it's really--
well, better than that.

00:10:49.950 --> 00:10:51.460
But, it's really, really,
good, right?

00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:54.310
I'm so glad you enjoyed it.

00:10:54.310 --> 00:10:55.730
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:10:55.730 --> 00:11:00.540
&gt;&gt; What's your favorite of Mr.
Brown's precepts from the book?

00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:05.420
&gt;&gt; R. J. Palacio: You know, I
think-- my favorite precept.

00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:10.370
Well, I guess, if you have
the choice between being right

00:11:10.370 --> 00:11:13.170
and being kind, choose kind.

00:11:13.170 --> 00:11:15.640
I would say that that
is probably my favorite.

00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:18.630
I will also say, it's not
in the original precepts,

00:11:18.630 --> 00:11:22.990
but it is one of Mr. Brown's
precepts in one of my other books,

00:11:22.990 --> 00:11:24.990
another precept I really love is,

00:11:24.990 --> 00:11:31.920
be kind because everyone you
meet is fighting a hard battle.

00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:36.310
And, I like that because it reminds
us that everyone's got a story

00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:40.310
to tell and sometimes we just
have to take the time to listen,

00:11:40.310 --> 00:11:43.730
you know, and be compassionate.

00:11:43.730 --> 00:11:45.030
So, thank you.

00:11:45.030 --> 00:11:46.330
Yes.

00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:48.400
&gt;&gt; I'm a parent volunteer
in a classroom,

00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:50.550
and I first read Auggie to--

00:11:50.550 --> 00:11:54.430
as a reading group volunteer
at Glenwood Elementary School

00:11:54.430 --> 00:11:59.420
in San Rafael to the
third-graders, and of course,

00:11:59.420 --> 00:12:02.310
Auggie and all the children
touched me beyond belief.

00:12:02.310 --> 00:12:05.570
And, I'm crying just
thinking about them.

00:12:05.570 --> 00:12:06.870 position:56%
But, while we were reading the book,

00:12:06.870 --> 00:12:11.420
I kept wondering where's the
adult outside of the family?

00:12:11.420 --> 00:12:12.720
Where's the adult?

00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:14.930
Come on, somebody's got
to jump in and help.

00:12:14.930 --> 00:12:18.350
And, then Mr. Tushman
came into the picture.

00:12:18.350 --> 00:12:22.090
So, my comment slash
question is twofold.

00:12:22.090 --> 00:12:27.100
What can we do as adults to
be more like the Mr. Tushman?

00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:30.470
How can we get more Mr.
Tushmans into our schools?

00:12:30.470 --> 00:12:34.180
There are so many schools
that don't have that presence

00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:36.230
and the adult role models.

00:12:36.230 --> 00:12:40.080
And then, would you ever
do a Mr. Tushman chapter,

00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:41.840
or have we had enough of him?

00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:43.740
I don't know.

00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:45.750
&gt;&gt; R. J. Palacio: Well,
those are great questions.

00:12:45.750 --> 00:12:48.730
I think-- I love Mr. Tushman.

00:12:48.730 --> 00:12:52.320
I, you know, it was very important
for me when I wrote Wonder

00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:54.250
to make sure that the grownups

00:12:54.250 --> 00:12:57.570
in the book were decent,
nice, good people.

00:12:57.570 --> 00:13:02.580
Because I had noticed a tendency in
some of the middle grade fiction,

00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:05.210
and also like, on TV
shows and stuff,

00:13:05.210 --> 00:13:11.070
to make grownups rather, unhelpful.

00:13:11.070 --> 00:13:12.540
Let's put it that way.

00:13:12.540 --> 00:13:18.460
And so, you know, Mr. Tushman,
to me-- I have five minutes,

00:13:18.460 --> 00:13:21.610
so I'm just going to try
to do it really quick.

00:13:21.610 --> 00:13:24.100
I would say, before,
what I said about voting

00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:28.790
and local school boards, one of
the reasons that's so important is

00:13:28.790 --> 00:13:30.600
because I think a lot
of teachers would

00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:34.830
like to be more like Mr. Tushman.

00:13:34.830 --> 00:13:39.340
And, I feel like they are
not always allowed to.

00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:43.020
They spend a lot of time
fighting political battles

00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:44.320
that they shouldn't be.

00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:47.770
They should be, it should be a
humanist approach to education

00:13:47.770 --> 00:13:53.620
and I do think that if we work
a little bit more about sort of,

00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:58.140
changing the school boards, and
the people that are, kind of,

00:13:58.140 --> 00:14:02.430
representing interests
that really aren't

00:14:02.430 --> 00:14:05.670
in their children's best
interest, in terms of, again,

00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:08.450
separation of church and
state, and all that stuff.

00:14:08.450 --> 00:14:11.650
I think that there would be
more Mr. Tushmans who rise,

00:14:11.650 --> 00:14:15.520
and who will be able to meet
the needs of these children.

00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:23.110
I think all adults should
remember that, I mean,

00:14:23.110 --> 00:14:25.660
we're not just parenting
our own kids.

00:14:25.660 --> 00:14:28.200
We have to look out for
other people's kids, too.

00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:31.590
You know, it's not enough
to be content, you know,

00:14:31.590 --> 00:14:34.440
when you have a kid in
the fifth or sixth grade,

00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:37.090
and to know that socially,
oh my kid's doing great,

00:14:37.090 --> 00:14:38.460
I don't have to worry about them.

00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:41.650
Or, my kid's popular and
everything, you know.

00:14:41.650 --> 00:14:45.790
Keep an eye out for those kids that
are struggling at the lower end

00:14:45.790 --> 00:14:48.760
of those social hierarchy ladders.

00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:50.150
Because they need help too.

00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:55.490 position:56%
And, sometimes it's other parents,
teachers, other people who, kind of,

00:14:55.490 --> 00:14:58.330
step in and help those children.

00:14:58.330 --> 00:15:04.660
So, I think, you know, not to,
again, not to quote a great woman.

00:15:04.660 --> 00:15:12.350
But, it takes a village, and you
know, we should all remember that.

00:15:12.350 --> 00:15:14.870
So, I only have time
for one last question.

00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:17.160
I think, or maybe two, depends.

00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:19.690
Two minutes, so let's go with you.

00:15:19.690 --> 00:15:20.990
Yes.

00:15:20.990 --> 00:15:23.690
&gt;&gt; When Jack punched
Julian in the face,

00:15:23.690 --> 00:15:27.660
was it really for Auggie,
or was it just for Jack?

00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:28.960
&gt;&gt; R. J. Palacio: That's
a great question.

00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:32.370
What do you think?

00:15:32.370 --> 00:15:34.490
&gt;&gt; For Jack.

00:15:34.490 --> 00:15:38.210
&gt;&gt; R. J. Palacio: You know, one
of the great things about writing,

00:15:38.210 --> 00:15:44.290
is that I have my opinion, but the
great thing is that you, sort of,

00:15:44.290 --> 00:15:49.560
you know-- writing and reading
a book, they're the two sides

00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:54.940
of the same thing, so if that's
your opinion, then, it's right.

00:15:54.940 --> 00:15:56.780
I would say the same thing.

00:15:56.780 --> 00:16:00.880
Having said that, when my younger
son read Wonder for the first time,

00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:07.780 position:56%
he asked me a question like, I think
it was a question like, which--

00:16:07.780 --> 00:16:13.010
who was the other boy in the mummy
mask during the Halloween thing.

00:16:13.010 --> 00:16:14.910
Was it Miles or Henry?

00:16:14.910 --> 00:16:16.890
And, I said, well, which do you
want it to be, and he said, no,

00:16:16.890 --> 00:16:18.720
that's not a good answer.

00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:20.290
Is it Miles or Henry.

00:16:20.290 --> 00:16:24.640
Like, so having said that, I would
say that your answer is right,

00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:27.320
but I think it was also
for Auggie a little bit.

00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:33.410
I think he felt, I think that Jack
just felt really bad in general

00:16:33.410 --> 00:16:35.260
about everything that was going on.

00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:40.910
He felt guilty, he felt shame,
and in a way, Julian just,

00:16:40.910 --> 00:16:45.470
he just kind of, like, said the
wrong thing at the wrong time,

00:16:45.470 --> 00:16:46.800
and Jack just had a moment.

00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:48.500
Like, he shouldn't have hit Julian.

00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:50.130
We should never resort to hitting.

00:16:50.130 --> 00:16:52.170
But, I think he was just
at his breaking point.

00:16:52.170 --> 00:16:53.470
And, that's why he did it.

00:16:53.470 --> 00:16:55.890
So, it was a little bit for
himself, a little bit for Auggie.

00:16:55.890 --> 00:16:57.190
I think you're right.

00:16:57.190 --> 00:17:01.970
So, I am told I have
to wrap it up now.

00:17:01.970 --> 00:17:03.390
Thank you so much.

00:17:03.390 --> 00:17:06.860
You've been such a great
crowd, and I really--

00:17:06.860 --> 00:17:11.810 position:56%
I so, I'm so happy to have been
able to talk to you, and so grateful

00:17:11.810 --> 00:17:17.130
for your time, so thank you
very much, and take care.

00:17:19.950 --> 00:17:25.990
Goodbye.
