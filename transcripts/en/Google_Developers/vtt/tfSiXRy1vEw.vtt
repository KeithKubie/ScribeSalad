ROMA SHAH: So I'm Roma, and
I'm the UX lead on Chrome.

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:09.000
So you've already heard today
about all the different ways

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.520
that we're tackling
the web app experience

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:13.770
from so many different fronts.

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:17.010
And you've heard about the
performance improvements, how

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.300
we're bringing
capabilities to web apps

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.630
that native apps already
have, and balancing

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.130
the friction of permissions,
with still keeping users safe.

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.800
So I'm here to talk today
a little bit about the user

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.950
experience run in general.

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:33.350
We've made some pretty
significant steps this year

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.820
that make it easier to design
intuitive and beautiful user

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.094
experiences across
native and web platforms.

00:00:40.094 --> 00:00:41.510
And my hope is
that you guys leave

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:46.180
this talk with a general
understanding of the philosophy

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:49.650
behind Material Design, some
practical tips on how to get

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:52.700
started even if you don't
have a designer on your team.

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.400
And I'm also going to talk
a little bit about some

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.940
of the Chrome UX changes
that we've made in Android L

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:04.190
that we hope moves the mobile
web experience forward.

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:07.580
So before I dig into the
philosophy of Material Design,

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:09.600
let's take a look at the
Material Design reel,

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.884
so you can get a visual design
sense of what it's about.

00:01:13.884 --> 00:01:14.550
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:16.089
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:02:01.498 --> 00:02:02.500
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.985
So the reason I want to get
into the philosophy of Material

00:02:05.985 --> 00:02:08.110
Design instead of just
jumping straight to the spec

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:10.870
and giving you
practical tips is that I

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:13.570
think it's really important
to understand what this design

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:16.250
framework is trying to achieve.

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:17.120
The spec is online.

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.840
You guys could just go
there right now look at it.

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.960
And it makes it easy for people
to build well-designed apps

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:25.620
but-- and that's
really important.

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.640
--but what I'm hoping is that
by understanding the philosophy

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.470
behind this design
framework you guys

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.952
can help us evolve it further.

00:02:36.952 --> 00:02:38.660
A spec is never going
to be able to cover

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:41.100
all the complexities
of any app out there.

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.750
And we need you guys are
really kind of push on it

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:46.690
and use it in novel ways
to help us evolve it.

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:50.120
It's a community effort.

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.940
So getting into the
philosophy, Material Design

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:58.170
is based in real life,
tactile experiences.

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.220
The name material suggest this.

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.130
But it was really
heavily inspired

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:05.890
by studies of paper and ink.

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:11.330
But it's more open and
imaginative with behavior

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:13.700
because there's code behind it.

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.080
So paper lends itself
really well to squares,

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:18.890
simple shapes like
squares and circles.

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:21.280
But unlike real
paper, this material

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.410
can split, heal,
rearrange itself,

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:26.780
and move itself about
when it needs to.

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:30.600
And while we want users to
feel like they can interact

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:34.310
with it in a realistic
way like real paper,

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:38.330
things should always
feel intuitive.

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:43.660
So let's take an example of
what it means to be material.

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:47.020
Material Design has attributes
that we're innately elite

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:48.480
familiar with in real life.

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:52.910
So there's surfaces, edges,
light, dimensionality,

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:53.600
and movement.

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:57.350
All of these things
give us visual cues

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:00.232
about how these objects
relate to each other

00:04:00.232 --> 00:04:01.940
and what the affordances
are in a design.

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:11.700
Material Design is bold,
graphic, and intentional.

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:13.940
It's based on the
foundational elements

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:16.430
of print design
and graphic design.

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:20.800
Typography and imagery,
colors, grids, scale, and space

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:24.190
all guide the visual design.

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:26.400
And when used appropriately,
these elements

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:30.310
combined will really make up
an esthetically pleasing UI

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:32.210
and a more immersive experience.

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:34.289
But beyond the
surface look and feel,

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:35.830
when these elements
are you the best,

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:37.680
they should really
also have function.

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.920
They should help convey
the meaning of elements,

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:42.240
the hierarchy of
the UI, and where

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:44.350
users should be focusing
their attention.

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:49.690
So let's take a look at Gmail
before and after having applied

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:53.790
these elements of design,
how it affects it.

00:05:02.839 --> 00:05:04.130
There's a lot more white space.

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:05.560
It's more readable.

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:10.050
And with the use of color and
this floating action button,

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:11.504
you see where the
user is supposed

00:05:11.504 --> 00:05:12.670
to focus their attention to.

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:18.430
So these elements should
also provide consistency

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:21.320
in a sense of familiarity
across platforms and devices.

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:28.400
In Material Design,
you've probably

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:31.109
noticed that there's a lot
more motion and animation.

00:05:31.109 --> 00:05:32.900
And it's not just there
for the sake of it.

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:35.790
Motion is meant to
provide meaning.

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:39.180
So motion and
animation are really

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:42.910
meant to reinforce the idea that
the user is initiating change.

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:44.930
The user is initiating action.

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:47.160
And they're in control.

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:50.330
So motion cascades
from touchpoints.

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:51.750
Changes in the
interface are meant

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:54.290
to provide visual feedback
and feel really directly

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:56.150
connected to what the
user has just done.

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:04.440
Motion also allows us to
make the experience more

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:06.290
immersive and natural.

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:09.820
It's no longer this
jump from screen A

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:13.660
to screen B but a really fluid
and deliberate transition

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:14.340
between states.

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:26.560
Material Design
also aims to create

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:29.890
a unified experience across
native and web platforms

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:33.870
and all the different device
sizes that are out there.

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:35.610
Across devices,
the user is meant

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:39.520
to be seeing these same
views of the same design.

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:43.442
And obviously, based on the
screen size, the interaction,

00:06:43.442 --> 00:06:45.650
and the input method that
is appropriate for whatever

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:48.550
that device is,
things should change.

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:52.460
But the colors,
iconography, and hierarchy

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:56.090
should all remained
somewhat constant.

00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:58.500
So those are kind of the
basics of the philosophy

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:00.000
behind Material Design.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.790
Now, I want to shift gears
is into how you can actually

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:05.480
apply these principles.

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:09.520
So the entire Material
Design spec up

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:12.460
on google.com/design/spec.

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:14.190
If you have the
luxury of a dedicated

00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:16.290
designer on your
team, this is the spec

00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:17.880
that they should
be going off of.

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:21.150
But if you don't, that's
why we're here right now.

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:23.160
So first of all,
you probably want

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:26.300
to use Polymer since you
can get in yearly for free.

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:28.530
And it's specifically for
building material design

00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:32.220
for web apps across
desktop and mobile.

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:34.790
And their website has everything
you need to get started,

00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:36.430
including some really
great demo apps

00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:41.240
that show you the interactive
elements of Material Design.

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:42.190
So Polymer is a tool.

00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:44.689
And you're actually going to
be hearing more about it later.

00:07:44.689 --> 00:07:48.740
But I'd like to dive into
a practical basic checklist

00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:51.910
of how to apply Material
Design to your apps.

00:07:51.910 --> 00:07:54.580
And the particular things
that I'm going to talk about

00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:57.330
will help you make
critical design decisions

00:07:57.330 --> 00:07:59.806
even if you don't have
a designer on your team

00:07:59.806 --> 00:08:02.055
and hopefully give you the
biggest bang for your buck.

00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:08.600
So Material Design has
recommended spacing and sizing

00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:11.560
guidelines, all of which
are detailed in online spec.

00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:13.730
Following these can
really just help

00:08:13.730 --> 00:08:16.780
the readability and
usability of your app.

00:08:16.780 --> 00:08:22.060
So components are on an
eight device independent

00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:25.080
pixel square grid.

00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:29.790
Type is on a four
dp squared grid.

00:08:29.790 --> 00:08:32.020
And the size of
structural elements

00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:34.320
are based on these
things called increment.

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:38.130
And increments are based on
standard app art height which

00:08:38.130 --> 00:08:42.770
is 56 dp on mobile and
64 dp on larger screen.

00:08:42.770 --> 00:08:46.690
So for example, we have
three different apps here.

00:08:46.690 --> 00:08:49.750
And they all have different
needs for different app bar

00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:53.180
heights or different view
heights for whatever reason.

00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:55.320
And all of these things
are in increments

00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:59.110
of 2, 3, or nx, the size of
the standard app bar height

00:08:59.110 --> 00:09:01.060
which is shown in the
orange one on the right.

00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:06.150
There are a number
of layout templates

00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:09.220
available to you on the
online spec for mobile,

00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:10.710
tablet, and desktop.

00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:13.520
And they give you an idea of
how keylines and spacing can

00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:18.180
work across screen sizes, window
sizes, different structures,

00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:20.980
and different elements.

00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:24.010
And if you're building an
app designed for touch input,

00:09:24.010 --> 00:09:30.550
you should really make your
touch targets 48 by 48 in dp

00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:33.840
whether the icons or
elements within that 48 by 48

00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:35.450
take up that full space or not.

00:09:40.870 --> 00:09:43.190
So Polymer has a
lot of components

00:09:43.190 --> 00:09:44.110
that you get for free.

00:09:44.110 --> 00:09:46.010
You should take
advantage of those.

00:09:46.010 --> 00:09:48.730
This includes icons
sets, widgets, elements,

00:09:48.730 --> 00:09:52.220
and transitions, all
based on Material Design.

00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:53.900
I'm going to take a
second to call out

00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:55.570
one of the specific
components that's

00:09:55.570 --> 00:09:58.220
pretty recognizable
in Material Design.

00:09:58.220 --> 00:10:04.520
And that is the floating action
button or FAB or paper FAB.

00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:07.300
This thing is supposed to be
the main and iconic action

00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:08.490
of your app.

00:10:08.490 --> 00:10:11.250
It's not supposed to be any
arbitrary action but something

00:10:11.250 --> 00:10:14.190
that a user can really
look at in one glance

00:10:14.190 --> 00:10:16.370
and understand what
is your app about.

00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:18.910
So for example, we have
this media app here.

00:10:18.910 --> 00:10:21.150
And a play/pause button
really gets the essence

00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:23.010
of what this app is about.

00:10:23.010 --> 00:10:26.000
In the Maps app, you have
a driving directions button

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:26.710
with a car.

00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:30.160
You really get a sense of this
is what this app is about.

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:32.740
And you should only ever
have one of these components

00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:35.520
on the screen at one time.

00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:38.570
And you probably don't need
these floating action buttons

00:10:38.570 --> 00:10:40.570
on all of your screens
within your app.

00:10:45.490 --> 00:10:45.990
Colors.

00:10:45.990 --> 00:10:49.260
So Material Design has
a lot of color palettes

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:51.742
that you should
take advantage of.

00:10:51.742 --> 00:10:53.950
I do you want to stress,
since it has come up before,

00:10:53.950 --> 00:10:58.410
that the Material Design
color palate does not

00:10:58.410 --> 00:11:00.610
equal the Google
Design color palette.

00:11:00.610 --> 00:11:04.070
This thing has plenty of range
to fit any app's branding

00:11:04.070 --> 00:11:07.090
and style needs.

00:11:07.090 --> 00:11:10.830
So it's easy to start with
the primary color of your app.

00:11:10.830 --> 00:11:13.330
This is usually going to be
the brand color of your app.

00:11:13.330 --> 00:11:16.150
So if the brand of
your app is red,

00:11:16.150 --> 00:11:20.800
let's say, this should probably
be red instead of indigo.

00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:23.110
And then, we have this
notion of accent colors.

00:11:23.110 --> 00:11:28.580
So accent colors really should
be bright not dull or dark.

00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:32.200
And they're really used
for button, UI elements,

00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:35.749
and components that you want
the users to focus and guide

00:11:35.749 --> 00:11:36.540
their attention to.

00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:45.740
The Material Design spec
recommends a stack of Roboto,

00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:47.725
then Noto, then,
Sans Serif-- that's

00:11:47.725 --> 00:11:51.660
a font stack-- at least
for body sized texts.

00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:53.500
But we doing
knowledge that fonts

00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:55.900
are often inseparable
from branding.

00:11:55.900 --> 00:11:58.370
So if you have a specific
font for your brand

00:11:58.370 --> 00:12:01.160
that really you want
to use everywhere,

00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:02.640
we recommend using
it for display

00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:06.690
sized texts not for body
sized texts, per se.

00:12:06.690 --> 00:12:11.220
But regardless of the
fonts that you use,

00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:13.620
you really should use
the sizing and spacing

00:12:13.620 --> 00:12:18.120
and weight and style guidelines
that they have in the spec.

00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:21.120
They've made a really easy
for you guys to just take.

00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:24.010
There's tons of typography nerds
that have worked on this stuff.

00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:27.820
Depth.

00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:29.480
Dimensionality and
shadows in depth

00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:31.880
are very important
in Material Design.

00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:36.280
So it helps to think of your
UI as existing in z space,

00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:37.390
not just x and y.

00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:43.220
So depth shouldn't
just be ornamental.

00:12:43.220 --> 00:12:46.110
Depth should be
giving users hints

00:12:46.110 --> 00:12:48.060
of how sections
relate to each other

00:12:48.060 --> 00:12:50.330
and move in ways
that seem plausible.

00:12:50.330 --> 00:12:51.960
Once you understand
the relationship

00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:54.710
of how sections in your
UI relate to each other,

00:12:54.710 --> 00:12:57.240
then you can start adding
shadows and dimensionality

00:12:57.240 --> 00:12:59.250
to things.

00:12:59.250 --> 00:13:02.320
So for example, on
the left, you see

00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:06.240
if there is a shadow there that
makes those two sections look

00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:08.830
somewhat separate from each
other or somewhat of a gap,

00:13:08.830 --> 00:13:11.990
it's natural for
the user to assume

00:13:11.990 --> 00:13:13.590
that if I swipe
one of those things

00:13:13.590 --> 00:13:16.010
away that the
other on may remain

00:13:16.010 --> 00:13:18.150
and moves independently
of the other.

00:13:18.150 --> 00:13:20.890
But the one on the right,
the seem between them

00:13:20.890 --> 00:13:22.940
is like a very light line.

00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:25.880
They still feel like they're
coplanar on the same section.

00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:28.000
And you would imagine that
if I swiped one of them

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.110
in one direction,
both of those things

00:13:30.110 --> 00:13:31.340
are going to go in the same.

00:13:34.900 --> 00:13:37.690
The z position is also meant to
be a reflection of your content

00:13:37.690 --> 00:13:38.470
hierarchy.

00:13:38.470 --> 00:13:40.510
And you're probably going
to use it with content

00:13:40.510 --> 00:13:43.630
that you typically want
the user to be focusing on,

00:13:43.630 --> 00:13:46.840
such as dialogue boxes or
floating action buttons

00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:48.800
that we were talking
about earlier.

00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:52.490
And this z-depth hierarchy
isn't necessarily

00:13:52.490 --> 00:13:54.490
a constant or fixed thing.

00:13:54.490 --> 00:13:57.430
For example, when a user
selects a date from Calendar,

00:13:57.430 --> 00:14:01.120
and it expands and moves
forward from the grid.

00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:04.990
So really make sure to
thoughtfully consider what

00:14:04.990 --> 00:14:08.920
z level each section
of your UI is in.

00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:12.050
And make sure that the shadows
it casts are appropriate.

00:14:12.050 --> 00:14:13.800
The movement is plausible.

00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:16.520
And Polymer, in fact, you can
use the Paper Shadow element

00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:21.170
to create z-depth and animate
between z of one to five.

00:14:24.990 --> 00:14:27.840
So motion, as we
talked about earlier,

00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:30.940
is also very important
in Material Design.

00:14:30.940 --> 00:14:32.900
But it's also one
of the things where

00:14:32.900 --> 00:14:34.610
it's really easy to
go overboard with.

00:14:34.610 --> 00:14:36.990
So transitions and
animations should

00:14:36.990 --> 00:14:39.997
be very deliberate
and meaningful but not

00:14:39.997 --> 00:14:40.955
necessarily gratuitous.

00:14:43.890 --> 00:14:46.940
A lot of the motion that you've
seen in this presentation today

00:14:46.940 --> 00:14:49.050
required a nontrivial
amount of work

00:14:49.050 --> 00:14:52.530
from motion designers
specific to that role.

00:14:52.530 --> 00:14:54.850
So if you don't have
dedicated motion designers,

00:14:54.850 --> 00:14:58.130
or you just don't have the
time to finesse these things

00:14:58.130 --> 00:15:00.680
on your own, I would recommend
just not worrying about it.

00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:03.530
It's better to stay
simple than to spend

00:15:03.530 --> 00:15:06.790
a lot of time and effort
making all these motions

00:15:06.790 --> 00:15:11.030
and animation that end up being
more distracting than helpful.

00:15:11.030 --> 00:15:13.440
And also you're going to
get a lot of transition

00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:17.010
in animations for free from
Polymer with the various UI

00:15:17.010 --> 00:15:18.520
widgets and elements.

00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:21.750
So if you do implement
custom animations,

00:15:21.750 --> 00:15:24.170
we recommend that
they be smooth, mimic

00:15:24.170 --> 00:15:27.380
true physical emotion,
give hints to your users

00:15:27.380 --> 00:15:30.760
about how this app works,
and then also reflect

00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:33.150
users choices and actions.

00:15:37.090 --> 00:15:40.765
So now that we've covered the
basics of Material Design,

00:15:40.765 --> 00:15:42.890
I really want to talk about
some of the big changes

00:15:42.890 --> 00:15:44.750
that we've made in Chrome.

00:15:44.750 --> 00:15:48.970
So first, let me start by
saying that applying Material

00:15:48.970 --> 00:15:51.580
Design to Chrome has been
a very interesting design

00:15:51.580 --> 00:15:53.960
exercise for us.

00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:57.700
We really like to think
of Chrome's core UI

00:15:57.700 --> 00:16:01.670
as a container for your guys'
app and your guys' content.

00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:05.370
And we usually strive to be
as invisible as possible.

00:16:05.370 --> 00:16:07.080
An approach that
we've landed on is

00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:10.550
to begin to apply Material
Design, starting first

00:16:10.550 --> 00:16:15.410
on mobile, using these
core foundational elements

00:16:15.410 --> 00:16:16.640
that we talked about earlier.

00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:21.540
But on the core parts like tabs,
the toolbar, and the omnibox,

00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:25.130
we're still going to remain much
more visually subtle than what

00:16:25.130 --> 00:16:28.470
an individual app
might be doing.

00:16:28.470 --> 00:16:30.980
So we basically want
our UI to be there

00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:32.235
for users when they need it.

00:16:32.235 --> 00:16:33.610
But most of the
time, they should

00:16:33.610 --> 00:16:36.520
be looking at your
content not Chrome.

00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:40.360
So beyond Material
Design, some of the stuff

00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:42.190
that we've been doing
is looking at how

00:16:42.190 --> 00:16:46.210
to make your apps fit more
naturally and intuitively and

00:16:46.210 --> 00:16:49.680
beautifully into
other platforms.

00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:51.560
So that brings me to
some of the big changes

00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:58.370
that we've made in the Chrome UX
for Android L. First, the most

00:16:58.370 --> 00:17:02.900
visible change that you'll see
here is that we've taken tabs

00:17:02.900 --> 00:17:05.190
outside of the Chrome
app and put them

00:17:05.190 --> 00:17:09.740
at the same level as your
Recent Apps in the Overview.

00:17:09.740 --> 00:17:12.579
So this is a pretty big
change to the user experience

00:17:12.579 --> 00:17:14.569
of the browser
where we separately

00:17:14.569 --> 00:17:17.812
have a separate browser
app that you go to.

00:17:17.812 --> 00:17:19.270
But we're really
excited about this

00:17:19.270 --> 00:17:23.530
because it brings
visibility of web content,

00:17:23.530 --> 00:17:25.329
brings visibility
to web content.

00:17:25.329 --> 00:17:31.750
And it actually un-silos
the web from a browser app.

00:17:31.750 --> 00:17:35.310
And for users, we think
that users shouldn't

00:17:35.310 --> 00:17:38.570
have to think about
the technologies

00:17:38.570 --> 00:17:39.710
that apps are built on.

00:17:39.710 --> 00:17:43.560
If I'm planning a
dinner with my friend,

00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:46.470
and I'm looking at restaurant
reviews on the web,

00:17:46.470 --> 00:17:52.000
I'm talking to my friends on my
native messaging or email app,

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:56.480
I'm going to be switching
back and forth between those

00:17:56.480 --> 00:17:57.560
and planning this thing.

00:17:57.560 --> 00:17:59.190
I'm thinking about my task.

00:17:59.190 --> 00:18:01.854
I'm not thinking about oh,
OK, that thing is on the web,

00:18:01.854 --> 00:18:03.520
so I need to go to
the browser for that.

00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:04.660
That thing is native,
so I need to go

00:18:04.660 --> 00:18:06.210
to the other switcher for that.

00:18:06.210 --> 00:18:08.915
So we want to have one single
place to switch between tasks.

00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:14.810
And in addition to
this new home for tabs,

00:18:14.810 --> 00:18:16.340
we want to continue
to make steps

00:18:16.340 --> 00:18:20.290
to level the visuals between
native apps and web apps.

00:18:20.290 --> 00:18:24.130
So you've notice in
Material Design in Android L

00:18:24.130 --> 00:18:26.830
that apps have really
boldly colored toolbars.

00:18:26.830 --> 00:18:29.892
And starting in Version
39 in Chrome for Android,

00:18:29.892 --> 00:18:31.850
you'll now be able to
choose a theme color meta

00:18:31.850 --> 00:18:34.240
tag to set Chrome's
toolbar color,

00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:37.900
giving you more control over the
look and feel of your content.

00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:41.300
The Theme toolbars will be
visible not only in the Browser

00:18:41.300 --> 00:18:44.090
view but in the Recent
Overview section

00:18:44.090 --> 00:18:47.775
as well to help users
with recognizability.

00:18:47.775 --> 00:18:49.400
Of course, what you
do here will really

00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:51.320
depend on the design
of your content.

00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:53.350
You may not want to
have multiple bars

00:18:53.350 --> 00:18:55.150
of really boldly colored things.

00:18:55.150 --> 00:18:56.990
So if you choose not
to use a theme color,

00:18:56.990 --> 00:18:58.864
we're still going to be
the same default gray

00:18:58.864 --> 00:19:00.590
that we are right now.

00:19:00.590 --> 00:19:02.680
So the syntax is pretty simple.

00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:05.620
You add a meta tag to your
page's head with the name theme

00:19:05.620 --> 00:19:12.450
dash color and set the content
to any valid opaque CSS color.

00:19:12.450 --> 00:19:15.600
Chrome will also show high
res fab icons in the Overview

00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:17.300
just like native apps have.

00:19:17.300 --> 00:19:20.200
And we pick the highest
res icon that you provide.

00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:24.040
And we recommend providing
a 192 by 192 PNG.

00:19:27.030 --> 00:19:31.580
So all the details for that
are on html5rocks and the web

00:19:31.580 --> 00:19:33.840
fundamentals site.

00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:37.860
So I hope I've helped guys get
a bit of a grasp on the efforts

00:19:37.860 --> 00:19:40.390
that we've been doing from
a user experience front

00:19:40.390 --> 00:19:42.520
to move the mobile web forward.

00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:44.450
Material Design is
basically a framework

00:19:44.450 --> 00:19:47.070
that helps anyone really make
thoughtful and well-designed

00:19:47.070 --> 00:19:51.150
apps whether they're built
natively or on the web

00:19:51.150 --> 00:19:52.810
with a really small
amount of effort

00:19:52.810 --> 00:19:55.130
using the tools and
specs that we provide.

00:19:55.130 --> 00:19:58.820
And the changes in Chrome
for Android Lollipop

00:19:58.820 --> 00:20:02.340
are our first steps to give you
guys more control over the look

00:20:02.340 --> 00:20:04.190
and feel of your stuff
and really simplify

00:20:04.190 --> 00:20:06.180
the workflow for our
users who don't really

00:20:06.180 --> 00:20:08.170
care whether something
is native or web.

00:20:08.170 --> 00:20:10.670
They just want to use this
stuff that they care about.

00:20:10.670 --> 00:20:13.360
And even more importantly,
what we need from you

00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:17.950
guys is to test out these
changes in Chrome, the Material

00:20:17.950 --> 00:20:20.090
Design framework,
and really, really

00:20:20.090 --> 00:20:23.040
stress test them with the
complexity of your apps,

00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:24.650
give us guidance and feedback.

00:20:24.650 --> 00:20:26.108
And that's the only
way we're going

00:20:26.108 --> 00:20:29.050
to be able to move the mobile
