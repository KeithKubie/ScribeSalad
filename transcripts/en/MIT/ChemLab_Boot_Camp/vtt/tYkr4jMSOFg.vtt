00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:01.460
PHIL: I mean everyone will
probably eat lunch.

00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:03.046
It's just a matter of where they
eat it and who they eat

00:00:03.046 --> 00:00:06.140
it with and if they
pay for it.

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:08.180
I mean, I'm sure everyone's
going to eat lunch on a day,

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:10.300
but some are going to have
to buy their own.

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:12.800
Some are going to be
dining with me.

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:43.180

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:46.380
NARRATOR: Yesterday in 5.301,
the students set up their

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:49.850
crystal growing experiments,
and some are growing fast.

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:52.360
JULIE: My crystal was
the first to form.

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.910
I think this is the largest
one I've seen so far.

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:57.700
So I thought I had won.

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:01.764
JOHN DOLHUN: Well, Julie
did get her crystal.

00:01:01.764 --> 00:01:04.760
So I saw it with my own eyes.

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:08.030
NARRATOR: Other crystals are
growing too, but their owner

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:09.630
isn't looking.

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.730
When Jason finally checks up
on his crystals, they're

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:13.440
looking good.

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.716
TENGFEI: In this well, we have
several a single crystals, and

00:01:17.716 --> 00:01:19.500
they are all big.

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.660
JASON: She had a crystal first,
but I haven't been

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:22.690
checking mine daily.

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:25.100
So I might have a
crystal first.

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.750
I don't know.

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:26.690
TENGFEI: Congratulations.

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:28.100
JASON: Thank you.

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.450
JULIE: I had a single crystal.

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:31.855
JASON: But I had multiple
single crystals.

00:01:31.855 --> 00:01:32.320
JULIE: What?

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:33.252
JASON: I had multiple
single crystals.

00:01:33.252 --> 00:01:35.116
JULIE: But my crystal
came first.

00:01:35.116 --> 00:01:38.378
JASON:

00:01:38.378 --> 00:01:40.800
JULIE: I'm not going
to bring it up.

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:42.388
I'm still the winner
as of right now.

00:01:42.388 --> 00:01:44.640
JASON: I'm gonna bring it up.

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:45.910
I won.

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:47.700
I had the largest crystal.

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.680
I just didn't check it because
I didn't want to disturb it.

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.580
Mine is definitely
bigger, clearly.

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:53.830
JULIE: OK, but mine crystallized
like made a

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:55.040
single crystal first.

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.920
JASON: And like Julie was like,
I won, I won, I won.

00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:59.483
I've got this tiny
little crystal.

00:01:59.483 --> 00:01:59.570
I just got it first.

00:01:59.570 --> 00:01:59.835
No.

00:01:59.835 --> 00:02:00.720
The competition was the largest

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:01.920
crystal in one week period.

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.090
So I checked after one week.

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.590
JULIE: His fault for not talking
to Dr. Dolhun earlier.

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:08.919
So--

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:12.250
JASON: If I would have just like
looked at it earlier and

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:15.280
told Dr. Dolhun earlier, I have
a crystal growing, then I

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.990
would have won.

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:18.500
JOHN DOLHUN: But you see
yeah, Jason, if you

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:19.405
would have came forward--

00:02:19.405 --> 00:02:21.330
JASON: I checked mine later.

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:22.340
And then I told Dr. Dolhun.

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.450
He was like, yeah,
but Julie won.

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.370
JOHN DOLHUN: We've already
declared a winner here.

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:27.370
JULIE: Mine.

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:28.715
Fantastic.

00:02:28.715 --> 00:02:30.580
JASON: Julie rubs it in
my face all the time.

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:33.240
JULIE: I mean, I was already
declared the winner, so he

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:34.870
can't, yeah.

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:35.380
He's honorable mention.

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:39.636
NARRATOR: So Julie wins the
prize, lunch for her and a

00:02:39.636 --> 00:02:41.230
friend or so she thinks.

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.920
PHIL: They both grew really
beautiful single crystals.

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.665
So the whole class got to enjoy
a lunch with the TAs and

00:02:48.665 --> 00:02:49.370
the instructor.

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:53.428
PHIL: We ended up going to
Chinatown for dim sum.

00:02:53.428 --> 00:02:57.680
And I have actually never
tried dim sum before.

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.880
So I got to try a lot
of new foods,

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.265
chicken feet, and tripe.

00:03:03.265 --> 00:03:06.964
JASON: It's basically
the lining of a

00:03:06.964 --> 00:03:08.832
cow's stomach, I think.

00:03:08.832 --> 00:03:09.910
PHIL: It was good.

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:10.670
It was good.

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:12.960
I always enjoy trying new
food, so everyone had

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:14.210
a really good time.

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:23.850
I've never felt so close to
dying in my entire life.

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:40.779
