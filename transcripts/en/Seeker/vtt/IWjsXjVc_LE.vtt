00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.399
Hey there power-crazed viewers, Trace here.

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:07.069
Internet hero Nikola Tesla dreamed of delivering
power wirelessly to the masses.

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:11.220
Of course, that was over a century ago, and
here we are today with “wireless phones”

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:13.010
that are anything but.

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:17.820
Researchers at Disney, yes, the cartoon/amusement
park juggernauts, have decided that simply

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.199
will not do, and they are trying to solve
the problem with a little Disney magic.

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:23.400
And science.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.730
Mostly science.

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:28.280
Wireless charging pads have existed for a
while now, but they’re far from perfect.

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:32.830
They work by running a high frequency alternating
current through a circular coil, which creates

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:34.080
a magnetic field.

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:38.930
That field induces a current in another circular
coil in the receiving device, and the device

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:40.300
converts it to direct current.

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.800
Presto change-o, your battery is charging
wirelessly.

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.440
We actually have a whole video about it.

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:49.110
I'm sure you get that the device isn’t physically
tethered to those charging spots, but just

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.430
because of that, if it’s picked up or moved
off the pad just a bit, and the juice stops

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:55.430
flowing.

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:59.610
Therefore, unless you just can’t stand the
sight of cables, wireless charging is still

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:00.610
not perfect.

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:04.250
The real holy grail would be wireless charging
at a distance.

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.670
Something that can keep you topped up while
you walk around and using your phone.

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.390
Researchers at Disney think they have an answer
to this.

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:16.330
Their solution was to design an entire room
that basically functioned as a giant three-dimensional

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:17.330
charging pad.

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:22.210
You’d never even know it was different from
any other room, aside that conspicuous copper

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:24.260
pole right in the middle of it.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:28.370
If you look closely at the copper pole and
you’ll see a gap towards the top.

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:31.530
In that gap are small discrete capacitors.

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:37.000
By combining those capacitors with a signal
generator and they can send alternating current

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.050
through the pole, the walls, the ceiling and
the floor at the frequency of their choice.

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:46.320
This creates a magnetic field around the pole,
and just like with current wireless chargers

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.090
on the market, if you have a receiver that
resonates at the right frequency, you’ve

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:53.070
got wireless charging almost anywhere in the
room.

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.970
Still, t’s not perfect.

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:00.680
Unless your phone and the receiver coil inside
are perpendicular to the magnetic field, nothing

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:01.740
is getting charged.

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.040
And of course, there’s the issue of safety.

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:08.980
The room can transmit enough power to charge
over 300 smartphones without exceeding the

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:13.700
government’s safety guidelines for how much
power a body can absorb, so long as you’re

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.310
standing more than 46 centimeters away the
pole, you shouldn't have to worry.

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.980
Also, it's probably best not to touch it.

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:25.020
Anything practical would need a shut-off mechanism
if a person got too close, or a wall around

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.450
the pole to keep people far enough away.

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:32.420
The researchers note though it’s important
that something actually consumes that power

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:38.370
since whatever goes unused is stored in the
room, and could be potentially harmful.

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:43.180
So future systems would need something to
monitor how much power is being used too.

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:44.580
There's a long way to go here.

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.780
The researchers are optimistic this technology
could be scaled for a variety of uses, from

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.099
small charging cabinets to warehouses that
use multiple poles.

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:57.800
Since this was developed by Disney, don’t
be surprised if future theme parks advertise

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:02.739
that your phone will magically never go dead,
while all the rooms suddenly have mysterious

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:04.230
pillars in the middle.

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.810

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:27.940
So this technique of wireless charging still
isn’t perfect, but maybe your phone’s

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:31.140
own radio waves could make your battery last
longer.

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:33.870
Amy’s got the science on that here.

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:37.010
So would you put up with an awkward pole in
the middle of your living room if it meant

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:38.349
you never had to plug your phone in again?
