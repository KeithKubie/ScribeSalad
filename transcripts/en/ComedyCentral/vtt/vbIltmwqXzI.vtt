00:00:04.538 --> 00:00:07.074
I MISSED MY BATWOMAN, SUZANNE,

00:00:07.107 --> 00:00:08.942
AND MY BAT-SON...

00:00:08.976 --> 00:00:10.344
BAT-EVERYTHING.

00:00:10.377 --> 00:00:13.413
HEY, THE BIKE LANES
ARE CLEARLY MARKED.

00:00:13.447 --> 00:00:16.416
- [bleep] YOU, BATMAN!

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:17.784
- [bleep] YOU.

00:00:17.818 --> 00:00:19.786
[bleep].

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:22.589
BUT I DID MY BEST
TO FIND CRIMINAL MASTERMINDS

00:00:22.623 --> 00:00:24.491
OR AS CLOSE
AS I COULD COME.

00:00:24.525 --> 00:00:26.260
EXCUSE ME.

00:00:26.293 --> 00:00:28.829
THIS SHOPPING CART
DOES NOT BELONG TO YOU.

00:00:28.862 --> 00:00:31.365
I'LL BRING IT BACK
TO THE FOOD SAVER.

00:00:31.398 --> 00:00:32.766
- WHAT?

00:00:32.799 --> 00:00:34.268
- I'M BATMAN.

00:00:34.301 --> 00:00:36.270
IT WAS CLEAR TO ME
THAT THE IDEA

00:00:36.303 --> 00:00:38.105
OF A PRIVATE CITIZEN
FIGHTING CRIME

00:00:38.138 --> 00:00:40.374
IS OF NO VALUE WHATSOEVER.

00:00:42.643 --> 00:00:43.977
THAT SHOULD BE LEFT
TO POLICE OFFICERS

00:00:44.011 --> 00:00:45.546
WITH THE PROPER TRAINING,
EQUIPMENT,

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:47.614
AND ACCOUNTABILITY TO SOCIETY.

00:00:47.648 --> 00:00:51.985
HOW THIS NEVER OCCURRED
TO BATMAN IS BEYOND ME.

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:53.987
YOO-HOO.

00:00:54.021 --> 00:00:55.455
YOU'RE BREAKING THE LAW
RIGHT NOW.

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:56.623
YOU MIND COMING WITH ME
TO THE POLICE STATION?

00:00:56.657 --> 00:00:58.559
- HA HA.
IT'S BATMAN.

00:00:58.592 --> 00:01:01.061
- STOP--OW.
THAT'S DISGUSTING.

00:01:01.061 --> 00:01:03.163
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU?
[cell phone rings]

00:01:03.197 --> 00:01:06.567
- WHAT?
- CONTROL YOURSELF.

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.202
HELLO?
- WHERE ARE YOU?

00:01:08.235 --> 00:01:09.570
WE'RE AT THE COURTHOUSE.
- WHAT?

00:01:09.603 --> 00:01:11.071
NO.
- I DON'T KNOW--

00:01:11.071 --> 00:01:13.507
- NO, NO, NO, NO.
NO, THAT WAS TOMORROW.

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:15.475
OH, NO, NO,
NO, NO, NO.

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:16.510
I'M HERE.
I JUST GOT HERE.

00:01:16.543 --> 00:01:18.312
WHAT FLOOR
ARE YOU GUYS ON?

00:01:18.345 --> 00:01:19.847
OKAY.
WELL, WHICH WAY IS IT?

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.882
WHICH WAY DO YOU GO IN
ONCE YOU'RE UP TOP,

00:01:21.915 --> 00:01:23.383
ONCE YOU'RE AT THE BEGINNING?

00:01:23.417 --> 00:01:24.818
OH.

00:01:24.852 --> 00:01:26.753
OH, YOU CAME IN
THROUGH THE PARKING GARAGE?

00:01:26.787 --> 00:01:28.188
WELL, WHEN YOU'RE IN THE LOBBY,
IS IT ALL

00:01:28.222 --> 00:01:32.092
ONE LOBBY FOR EVERYTHING,
OR IS IT...?

00:01:32.092 --> 00:01:34.494
IF YOU'RE STANDING
ON THE SIDEWALK--HANG ON.

00:01:34.528 --> 00:01:37.598
HEY, YOU GUYS, DO YOU KNOW
WHERE FAMILY COURT IS?

00:01:37.631 --> 00:01:40.367
WHAT FL--OR WHICH ENTRANCE
YOU GO IN FOR FAMILY COURT?

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.236
IS IT THE MIDDLE?
OKAY, THANK YOU.

00:01:42.269 --> 00:01:44.104
YEAH, I GOT IT.
I'M GOING IN THE MIDDLE DOOR.

00:01:44.104 --> 00:01:47.107
[elevator beeping]

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:50.878
- FORREST?
- YES.

00:01:50.911 --> 00:01:53.247
SUZANNE, CAN I SPEAK WITH YOU
FOR JUST ONE SECOND, PLEASE?

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.282
JUST ONE SECOND, PLEASE.

00:01:55.315 --> 00:01:56.717
- WHY ARE YOU DRESSED
LIKE THIS?

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.119
ARE YOU GOING CRAZY?
- NO.

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:01.522
LET'S NOT DO THIS.
I DON'T WANT TO BE DIVORCED.

00:02:01.555 --> 00:02:02.856
LET'S JUST GO--
- OKAY, FORREST,

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:04.224
I UNDERSTAND
THAT YOU ARE NOT

00:02:04.258 --> 00:02:06.126
IN THE BEST FRAME OF MIND
RIGHT NOW, OKAY?

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:08.762
- I AM THINKING VERY CLEARLY.
- YOU ARE CLEARLY NOT.

00:02:08.795 --> 00:02:12.900
BUT I AM CERTAIN
THAT THIS IS BEST FOR US, OKAY?

00:02:12.933 --> 00:02:14.268
- HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT?

00:02:14.301 --> 00:02:15.736
WE HAVE A LIFE TOGETHER.
- I CAN'T--

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:17.704
- MACNEIL!

00:02:17.738 --> 00:02:19.706
- [sighs]

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:20.941
- SUZANNE--SUZANNE.

00:02:20.974 --> 00:02:22.776
- STOP IT.
I'M SORRY.

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:25.212
- IT'S ALL RIGHT.
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

00:02:25.245 --> 00:02:26.580
- THIS WAS SUPPOSED
TO BE WEDNESDAY.

00:02:26.613 --> 00:02:29.917
- I WAS LOOKING
AT LAST YEAR'S CALENDAR.

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:33.820
- [sighing]
