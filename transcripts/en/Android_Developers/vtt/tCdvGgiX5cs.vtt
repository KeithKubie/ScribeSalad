00:00:09.987 --> 00:00:11.570
SIMON HADE: When we
started Space Ape,

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:13.390
things were definitely smaller.

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:15.000
We were only 12 people.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.115
Now, we're 55.

00:00:16.115 --> 00:00:18.115
TOBY MOORE: We were new
to building mobile games

00:00:18.115 --> 00:00:20.140
but had a lot of experience
building games in general.

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:21.710
We just needed to
learn very quickly.

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:23.959
So we needed to use it as a
learning platform, as well

00:00:23.959 --> 00:00:25.590
as making a video
game for our users.

00:00:28.142 --> 00:00:29.850
JOE REABURN: We'd all
been kicking around

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:32.310
ideas of what would make
great combat strategy game.

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:34.740
And really, we just loved Japan.

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:38.190
And we loved Japanese
and Eastern fantasy.

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.790
JOHN EARNER: "Samurai Siege"
is about building and battling.

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:42.620
You build a fortress.

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:44.222
You increase its strength.

00:00:44.222 --> 00:00:46.180
And you try and defend
it against other players

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:47.971
who are trying to steal
resources from you.

00:00:47.971 --> 00:00:51.810
And you, in turn, battle them
and steal their resources.

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:53.790
SIMON HADE: We had
fairly modest ambitions

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:55.830
for "Samurai Siege" when
we kicked things off.

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:59.080
We launched it initially in
Australia and New Zealand.

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.090
Then, we had about a
six-week beta period.

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:04.760
JOHN EARNER: Within two weeks of
putting the game live on beta,

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.180
we were already making
$10,000 a day gross.

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:09.250
And so, we went live globally.

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:12.230
And within a month, we had
about 300,000 people daily.

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:14.750
About a 1.5 million people
playing the game monthly.

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:16.202
And at that point,
we really knew

00:01:16.202 --> 00:01:18.140
that we were onto something.

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.220
These days, we make
about $55,000 a day.

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:22.980
It spikes on weekends.

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:25.960
Our biggest day,
we made $220,000,

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.430
which is both a small
number if you compare it

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:30.880
to some of the biggest
game companies out there,

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.072
but pretty cool if you're
18 or 24 months old,

00:01:34.072 --> 00:01:36.030
and you're just getting
off the ground with one

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:36.904
of your first titles.

00:01:36.904 --> 00:01:38.635
So we're pretty
thrilled with it.

00:01:38.635 --> 00:01:41.010
SIMON HADE: Android part of
our revenue has been growing.

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:42.540
It's 50%.

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.310
A lot of the growth's coming
from our focus on Asia.

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:49.016
10% to 15% of our revenue, I
think, comes from Japan alone.

00:01:49.016 --> 00:01:50.640
JOE REABURN: We always
intended to take

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:51.810
"Samurai Siege" to Japan.

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.310
We just wanted to make sure
that we got it right, because we

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.810
knew we had one shot at one
of the world's largest gaming

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:57.310
markets.

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:58.684
JOHN EARNER: We
spent four months

00:01:58.684 --> 00:01:59.980
preparing Japan for launch.

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:02.272
And the game had been live
pretty much everywhere else.

00:02:02.272 --> 00:02:03.729
JOE REABURN: One
of the reasons is,

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:05.660
we spent a long time
to localize our game

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:08.320
and culturalize our game, just
have a really high quality

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:09.360
translation.

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.930
JOHN EARNER: We learned how
users see advertisements.

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.600
We learned what they
thought about the game.

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.820
We spent a month in beta
in Japan testing it.

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:18.340
SIMON HADE: So we
had to find people

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:19.839
who would like our
game locally, who

00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:21.660
could be ambassadors for us.

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.510
So then when we're
live, they were really

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.039
the voice of our
players in Japan.

00:02:27.039 --> 00:02:28.830
JOE REABURN: The
alpha/beta testing feature

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.610
in the Google Play Development
Console is a good way to go.

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:33.350
So you can hand-select
a group of people

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:35.330
that are associated
with the Google group.

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.496
And then, you can start
getting feedback from users.

00:02:37.496 --> 00:02:40.265
You start seeing how your game
performs in the real world.

00:02:40.265 --> 00:02:42.880
For our marketing material
on the Google Play Store,

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.990
we wanted it to look like a
local Japanese company had

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:49.330
created it, which really
meant more exclamation

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:52.090
marks and cooler
character drawings.

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:54.765
We used our internal Japanese
staff to tell us how to look.

00:02:54.765 --> 00:02:56.040
And we got it together.

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.332
Turns out, it looks really
cool, looks really exciting.

00:02:58.332 --> 00:03:00.373
TOBY MOORE: Google Play
has been a great platform

00:03:00.373 --> 00:03:01.260
to develop with.

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.100
I've really enjoyed the fast
iteration speed and the way

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:07.100
that Google think about bringing
games to the Google Play Store

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:09.040
and working with the
partnership team there.

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.373
JOHN EARNER: Experience has
been great with Google Play.

00:03:11.373 --> 00:03:12.920
We have found that
it is about half

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:15.706
of our audience and
half of our business.

00:03:15.706 --> 00:03:18.330
Thrilling as it has been to have
the success we've had to date,

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:20.680
the thing that we're really
looking for, that next step,

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:21.470
is down the road.

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:23.470
I think that's what keeps
people going in gaming

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:25.884
is it's always the thrill
of working on the next game

00:03:25.884 --> 00:03:26.800
and seeing it go live.

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:29.200
And so, I'm looking
forward to the next one.

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.650
