00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:06.400
A space that I love
in anticipation

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.680
is the Smith Campus Center.

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:12.100
This is, for me, a
dream that is soon

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:16.270
going to come true with
its completion in the fall.

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:19.180
When I became
president, we started

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:22.870
talking about how to bring
the university together.

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:27.520
And I appointed a task
force on common spaces

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:31.990
to help us think about
the physical foundations

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:35.920
for sharing and
unity and integration

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.980
of the university
we could imagine.

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:41.320
And one of the ideas
that soon came out

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.020
of that was repurposing
what was then called Holyoke

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:48.940
Center into a campus
center that would not

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:52.000
be part of any
particular school,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.870
but would be a university-wide
space in which people could

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:59.740
bump into each other, share
ideas, find spaces in which

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:03.490
to have meetings for their
organizations and groups,

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:07.980
and embody the unity
that I so strongly felt

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:10.450
would strengthen the university.

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:14.740
And so with a magnificent gift
from Susan and Richard Smith,

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:19.600
we were able to embark on
redesigning the wonderful

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.920
[INAUDIBLE] building
located right on Mass Ave

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.900
at the center of
the Cambridge Campus

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:29.950
and envision a different way
for the members of the Harvard

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:32.650
and broader communities
to come together.

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:34.810
I think it's going
to be a space that

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:38.260
will change social dynamics,
intellectual dynamics

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:39.920
within the university.

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.560
So it's my anticipated favorite
space for the years to come,

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.500
though it's still
in my imagination

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.400
rather than in actuality.
