You might be thinking, great we solved our equation. But remember, we've only

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:08.680
solved for u so far. What we really want to solve for is our original variable,

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:15.210
x. Since u was actually equal to e to the x, what we really have here is e to

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:20.590
the x equals 3 and e to the x equals 2. However, you know how to solve each of

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:25.680
these equations. So, please solve for x and round each of your answers to three

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.019
decimal places.
