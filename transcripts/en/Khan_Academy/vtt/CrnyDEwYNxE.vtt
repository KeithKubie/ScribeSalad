00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.440
- [Instructor] In many videos already,

00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:04.140
we have talked about our
three branches of government

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.240
in the United States, but
what we're going to do

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.080
in this video is focus a little bit more

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:09.940
on the judicial branch.

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:10.910
As we've talked about,

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:15.306
the judicial branch's main goal
is to be the final authority

00:00:15.306 --> 00:00:18.250
on the United States Constitution.

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:19.900
And the main check that they have

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.440
on the legislative and executive branches

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:25.351
is that they can deem
things that are happening

00:00:25.351 --> 00:00:26.930
in the other branches,

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:29.030
say a law that gets passed by Congress

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:31.710
or an executive order from the president,

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.980
as being unconstitutional.

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:37.750
They can also interpret the
laws that have been passed.

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:39.870
And so that's where they get their power.

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.480
Now another interesting thing
about the judicial branch

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.500
that we've talked about
is unlike the executive

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.276
and legislative branch,
where these folks are elected

00:00:47.276 --> 00:00:50.300
on a semi-regular basis,
the Supreme Court,

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:51.874
these are lifetime appointments.

00:00:51.874 --> 00:00:55.096
Once someone is nominated by the president

00:00:55.096 --> 00:00:57.760
and then confirmed by the Senate,

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.770
they're in the Supreme Court for life.

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:02.630
And so the question is

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:04.670
is when the Supreme Court does something

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.220
that say, the president
or a member of Congress

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:09.673
disagrees with, what can they do?

00:01:09.673 --> 00:01:11.740
Well, there's a couple of options here.

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.360
One option, let's say
that a clause of a law

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.080
is deemed unconstitutional.

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.200
So let's say that there's a law here

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.550
and this part of it, the
US Supreme Court says,

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:24.240
"No, that's not consistent
with the Constitution,"

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.360
sometimes, the legislature
might decide to,

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.570
hey, let's try to pass another law

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:33.660
that clarifies that clause
in a way that is in line

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:36.400
with the Constitution, or
we'll do a whole other law

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:40.630
that's worded different,
but it has the same purpose.

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:43.270
And so the legislative
branch can't overrule

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.639
the judicial branch, but they
can try to revise their laws

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:49.420
to get more in line with their intent

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.560
but not get the negative judicial review.

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.120
The president also has some levers.

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.260
There's examples in
history of the president

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.550
just outright ignoring a judicial verdict.

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:04.640
For example, Thomas Jefferson,
during the Embargo Act

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:05.600
during his administration,

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.520
this is during the Napoleonic Wars,

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.170
and those warring nations
were taking advantage of

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.720
American vessels and seamen,
and Thomas Jefferson decided,

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.850
hey, we don't want to have
trade with those countries.

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:18.090
There are aspects of those
that the Supreme Court,

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.040
including some Jefferson appointees,

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.870
decided were unconstitutional
but Jefferson just kind of

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.477
kept executing the way he wanted to.

00:02:25.477 --> 00:02:27.330
You fast-forward a few decades

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.301
to the beginning of the Civil War,

00:02:29.301 --> 00:02:33.170
President Lincoln decided
that, hey, there's some people

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.580
causing some trouble and
we need to detain them,

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.040
and we know there's a constitutional right

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.780
of habeas corpus that says
that people should be allowed

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:44.510
to go to court to decide
whether the detention is legal,

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:46.530
to decide whether they should be detained,

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.680
but President Lincoln decided
to suspend habeas corpus

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.520
in certain parts of the country,

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:53.750
which the Supreme Court
was not happy with.

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:55.980
But he decided to just go ahead with it

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:57.620
with the argument that it was necessary

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:59.127
to preserve the Union.

00:02:59.127 --> 00:03:02.652
And perhaps the most famous
example of a president

00:03:02.652 --> 00:03:05.903
not being happy with
verdicts of the Supreme Court

00:03:05.903 --> 00:03:10.903
was FDR, as he took office in the midst

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.190
of the Great Depression.

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:14.208
There's a whole series of federal programs

00:03:14.208 --> 00:03:16.354
that he was trying to pass,

00:03:16.354 --> 00:03:19.787
and the Supreme Court started
to strike down many of these,

00:03:19.787 --> 00:03:22.600
saying that, hey, this was not the role

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.139
of the federal government,
or this was overreaching

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:26.916
by the executive.

00:03:26.916 --> 00:03:29.473
And so FDR was not happy with this,

00:03:29.473 --> 00:03:32.854
and so he actually proposed
to the legislative branch

00:03:32.854 --> 00:03:36.821
the Judicial Procedures
Reform Bill of 1937,

00:03:36.821 --> 00:03:38.910
which essentially said, hey,

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:40.860
as soon as a Supreme Court justice is over

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:43.050
70 and a half years old, I
should be able to appoint

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:45.610
another Supreme Court justice, up to six,

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:47.879
and it turns out there
were exactly six justices

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:50.160
who had already reached that age,

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.650
so he essentially wanted
to pack the Supreme Court

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:56.260
with six new justices
that would agree with him,

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.630
that would allow him to do what he wanted.

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:00.810
The legislative branch did not pass

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:04.530
his Judicial Procedures
Reform Bill of 1937,

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:06.710
but some historians think
that it had the impact

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:08.500
that he wanted, because it seems,

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:11.750
and we don't know for sure,
after he even tried to do this,

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:14.930
the judicial branch seemed
more friendly to FDR.

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:17.130
So maybe they said, "Hey, you know,

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:19.670
"maybe we don't want to
mess with this guy too much

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:21.840
"because eventually he
might be successful.

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:24.170
"Instead of having nine
Supreme Court justices,

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:25.350
"we'll have 15."

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:27.590
People sometimes call
this the switch in time

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:28.730
that saved nine.

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:31.120
But to get an appreciation of
how people thought about it,

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:33.515
I have some political
cartoons from the time,

00:04:33.515 --> 00:04:36.110
and these are fun to just
pause and take a look at it.

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:38.380
So this says Trying to
Change the Umpiring.

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:41.320
So this is the Supreme Court,
President Roosevelt here,

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:43.928
and he's saying "Listen. I
don't like your decisions.

00:04:43.928 --> 00:04:46.480
"From now on, you're
going to have to work with

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:49.130
"someone who can see things my way!"

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:51.572
and you can see all the different
bats that he tried to use

00:04:51.572 --> 00:04:55.070
and they were all ruled out by the umpire.

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:58.040
The NRA, the AAA, these are all different

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:59.760
government institutions or programs

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:01.370
that FDR was trying to set up

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:02.850
in order to fight the Great Depression,

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:04.610
as part of his New Deal.

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:07.704
And they say, "New Deal Acts
declared unconstitutional."

00:05:07.704 --> 00:05:09.888
I have another political
cartoon right over here,

00:05:09.888 --> 00:05:11.737
and it's from that same period in time.

00:05:11.737 --> 00:05:15.180
Do We Want A Ventriloquist
Act In The Supreme Court?

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:18.831
And you see Uncle Sam here
and then you have FDR,

00:05:18.831 --> 00:05:21.430
and it looks like he's
got his hand controlling

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:25.580
these puppets and it says,
"Yes, yes, we all vote yes!"

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:27.186
and even FDR did not get his way

00:05:27.186 --> 00:05:30.600
with his court-packing plan
as it's sometimes called,

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:34.480
let me write that down,
his court-packing plan,

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:38.980
as I mentioned, some historians
believe that it did help

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:41.106
influence the court being a
little bit friendlier to him,

00:05:41.106 --> 00:05:44.250
and a somewhat irony of it
is at the end of the day,

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:47.206
because FDR served so
many terms in office,

00:05:47.206 --> 00:05:49.940
he was able to make eight out of nine

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:51.830
Supreme Court appointments.

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:54.332
So in a lot of ways, he did determine

00:05:54.332 --> 00:05:57.080
the inclinations of the Supreme Court

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:00.490
for many decades to come well
after his administration.
