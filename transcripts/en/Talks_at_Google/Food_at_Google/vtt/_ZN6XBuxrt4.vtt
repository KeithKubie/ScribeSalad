&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: Hi everybody. Thanks so
much for coming. Amanda Hesser is here today

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:11.830
and she's probably best known as long time
food writer and staff writer at the New York

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:16.760
times where she created the two columns Food
Diary and Recipe Redux . And she was also

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:21.859
the food editor at the Times magazine where
she launched the style magazine, T Living.

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:27.609
She has written several books including Cooking
for Mr. Latte, which I loved. [chuckles] And

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:31.689
her two latest books which are her two cookbooks.
The Essential New York Times Cookbook and

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:36.830
Food 52 which is based on the website she
co-founded, of food 52 dot com. So please

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:40.020
join me in welcoming to Google New York Amanda
Hesser.

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.020
[applause]

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:44.350
&gt;&gt;Presenter: So Amanda, thank you so much
for being here.

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:45.559
&gt;&gt;Amanda: Thanks for having me.

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:48.730
&gt;&gt;Presenter: We're thrilled to have you. And
we're, first of all, sorry that Merrill couldn't

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:52.850
join us. I know she's off doing more important
things than coming to Google.

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:53.850
[laughter]

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.250
&gt;&gt;Amanda: Mostly just being very pregnant.

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:00.600
&gt;&gt;Presenter: So I'm glad she didn't get caught
up in the whole baby Beyonce debacle. She's

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.399
still waiting it out and not -- good.

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.199
&gt;&gt;Amanda: [laughing] She'll be at the hospital,
thankfully

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.869
&gt;&gt;Presenter: She'd be actually able to see
her baby. That's a good thing. So Amanda can

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:10.870
you talk to us about how you got your start
in food writing.

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:16.430
&gt;&gt;Amanda: Well, I started by cooking. I was
in college studying finance and economics

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:27.540
and I was, you know, kind of lost and so,
started -- I did a study abroad at the London

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:33.140
School of Economics and traveled around and
had this sort of classic 'aha moment' that

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:37.490
lots of Americans have the first time they
travel in Europe which is like, “oh my God,

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:43.649
the food is so amazing here and it matters
so much here”. And I'm really interested

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:49.841
in this. I grew up with really great food
and so, it was just that, you know, a great

00:01:49.841 --> 00:01:55.579
lightbulb moment that I decided, no I'm not
going to go on an interview and wear a suit.

00:01:55.579 --> 00:01:57.649
I'm going to instead work

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:59.680
&gt;&gt;Presenter: Where one to Google

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:05.250
&gt;&gt;Amanda: -- exactly. [laughs] Work for free
in a restaurant in Boston. So I started by

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.470
working in restaurants and bakeries and I
drove a bread truck around Boston in the middle

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:16.570
of the night and I also -- and then I moved
to Europe after college and I worked -- I

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:21.970
started in Germany and I worked in Switzerland
and Italy and France, cooking and baking.

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:27.950
And, you know, I had some, you know, unusual
jobs like I mean I worked through the night

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:34.790
as a baker. I lived above the bakery and I
worked with you know 25 old men. [laughter]

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:39.150
And that was -- it was actually really fun.
And I think what happened was that over time,

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:47.090
I realized that if you're going to be a chef
or baker, like, you just know when you have

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:53.099
like great talent. And if you don't. You know
if you have the talent to become like a Jean-Georges

00:02:53.099 --> 00:03:00.480
of the world or not. And I felt like to work
that hard, like, you had to have that talent.

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:06.610
And I don't. [laughs] And I also always found
myself, like, as much as I love being in the

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:11.400
kitchen, I liked being on the other side of
the door. Like, I liked dining as well. And

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:17.420
I just -- I like the stories behind food.
My interest were really in like the narrative

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:24.280
of the day in a restaurant. You know, all
the kind of different characters who would

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:32.090
stream in. And that was like the writer in
me. Like it took me awhile to kind of figure

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:36.590
out that actually what I really wanted to
do was kind of write about it. And so, and

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:42.380
then when I finally did, I just -- I mean,
there were no blogs then. Which is letting

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:48.210
you know how old I am. [laughter] But I did
-- you know I did have an e-mail account in

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:52.000
France which was one of those Compuserve plus
like 12 digit.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.510
Do you remember those.

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:58.500
&gt;&gt;Presenter: This is how old I am. I was in
college. I didn't even know what they were.

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:03.900
&gt;&gt;Amanda: France had this crazy thing called
Minitel. Do you know Minitel? Oh you know

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:09.950
it. [laughs] [audience member calls out] It
was like Minitel and e-mail. That's pretty

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:16.160
much all we had. So I just started writing
and sending pitches and I got lucky. My first

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:21.310
story was in the Washington Post and then
I got hired. And then I started writing a

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:27.380
book actually which was my first book called
The Cook and the Gardener. And I -- right

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:31.400
after I finished that basically I got hired
at the New York times which was completely

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:35.690
a stroke of luck. And I was, like, all right
I guess I'm a writer now. [laughs]

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:40.720
&gt;&gt;Presenter: So it really just happened from
you just deciding to write about something

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:45.960
you were passionate about not really knowing
you were a writer.

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:49.850
&gt;&gt;Amanda: Exactly. You know when you want
-- you need to express yourself in some way,

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:56.600
writing was the form that sort of made sense
then and I got some lucky breaks. So then

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:59.220
spent a lot of years kind of actually improving.

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:05.310
&gt;&gt;Presenter: So now having started in print,
I mean, you have such a strong background

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:09.130
in print with the Times and all the books
that you've written etcetera. And then making

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:14.320
this move to the web, how did that happen?
Or what sort of prompted that?

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:21.970
&gt;&gt;Amanda: Boredom one. I mean, the thing is
like because I didn't intend to become a writer,

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:27.260
I don't think like I was necessarily like
born to be a writer for the rest of my life.

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:33.810
And you know I do think I had an entrepreneurial
side which is why I studied finance and economics.

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:40.300
But it took me awhile to put the two together.
So I had been at the New York times for 11

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:46.840
years. It's an amazing company to work for
and they -- you know, I had been able to do

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:52.210
a lot of different things while I was there.
I was a reporter. I was an editor. I did restaurant

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:58.310
reviewing. I did wine writing. I traveled
a ton. I created new things. I wrote books.

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:02.370
But then I sort of felt like I was maxing
out on the creative things I could do.

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:04.850
&gt;&gt;Presenter: Once you've acted with Meryl
Streep, you're done.

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:12.560
&gt;&gt;Amanda: Yeah, I sort of feel like I had
the perfect acting career because I got a

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:16.430
part. I ended up actually in the movie and
then I never had to tryout again.

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:18.620
&gt;&gt;Presenter: Find yourself.

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:24.360
&gt;&gt;Amanda: Exactly. But so I -- I just thought
like you know I could stay at the New York

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:30.920
times and I could have a very fine career
and retire there, right? Ho hum. And or I

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:35.710
could pursue other things. And I actually
left the times to do a different start up

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:40.740
that had nothing to do with food. It was kind
of a digital time line of your life because

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:46.150
I was feeling we are all living online and
I feel like it's very diffuse and I wanted

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:51.070
to find a way to pull it together. I mean,
obviously it was a very ambitious idea which,

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:57.020
you know, but it was great because I actually
spent a year kind of immersing myself in the

00:06:57.020 --> 00:07:04.530
New York startup world. And you know meeting
lots of people. You know, I ended up teaming

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:11.360
up with two guys who had just graduated from
ITP. And you know we build prototype and then

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:16.150
we realize we couldn't--. It was just too
big. So we ended up doing a little Twitter

00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:24.130
app called Plodt. Which -- and it was just,
you know, a good kind of learning curve that

00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:31.540
has worked out to be a nice starting point
for Merrill and me to get started on Food

00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:37.650
52. I met a lot of people. I had a sense of
how to start a company.

00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:41.480
&gt;&gt;Presenter: Right. So now when you started
Food 52, was the intention just to do another

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:45.940
startup because food is your background that's
the natural place to land or.

00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:51.400
&gt;&gt;Amanda: We had a problem we wanted to solve
and we decided to try to get at that solution

00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:56.760
with a very simple proof of concept. The problem
we wanted to solve was that like, in the early

00:07:56.760 --> 00:08:02.300
days of the Internet, there were a couple
of really good recipe databases started, all

00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:08.360
recipes dot com, Epicurius and the like. Something
called Recipes Are, which is now food dot

00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:17.169
com. And, but over the years I mean, you know,
what they had done was sort of no longer kind

00:08:17.169 --> 00:08:23.110
of useful because they've grown to become
these giant recipe databases but with like

00:08:23.110 --> 00:08:30.949
sort of no filtering. So it's like this mosh
pit of recipes. And we felt like that was

00:08:30.949 --> 00:08:34.570
not something that appealed to us as people
who really cared about feed.

00:08:34.570 --> 00:08:38.510
&gt;&gt;Presenter: You were looking for something
online that wasn't.

00:08:38.510 --> 00:08:43.900
&gt;&gt;Amanda: It was like too much. But then on
the other side was this other interesting

00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:47.890
thing that was going on which, of course,
was the explosion of food blogs. And the thing

00:08:47.890 --> 00:08:53.310
that was interesting to us -- it was not like
technology had allowed this mass of people

00:08:53.310 --> 00:08:56.871
to express themselves.
Of course that is one aspect. But to us it

00:08:56.871 --> 00:09:04.080
was that in 2008 I think food blogs were one
of the top three blog topics. And that to

00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:13.330
us was signified a cultural shift from Americans
like being interested and excited about food

00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:18.930
-- like, shifting from there to actually knowing
so much about food that they wanted to express

00:09:18.930 --> 00:09:24.850
themselves and be credited for their knowledge
and their talents in the kitchen. And that

00:09:24.850 --> 00:09:29.690
was a very like important shift, because to
us it meant that there were -- if there were

00:09:29.690 --> 00:09:35.050
this many people creating their own food blogs,
think of how many people who are equally knowledgeable

00:09:35.050 --> 00:09:39.460
and talented who just are not going to take
the time and they don't have any place online.

00:09:39.460 --> 00:09:47.310
There's no place for them to talk to each
other, to get celebrated, and there is no

00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:55.761
-- and the rest of the blogs are incredibly
diffuse. So there's no kind of like, you know,

00:09:55.761 --> 00:10:01.810
hub for people who really cared about food
and wanted this curated, filtered experience.

00:10:01.810 --> 00:10:06.230
So we thought, "okay, well great." That's
a big thing to tackle. Why don't we start

00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:10.900
by doing what we know how to do well. Which
is create a cookbook. Community cookbooks

00:10:10.900 --> 00:10:15.510
are an American tradition. It's a concept
that people can instantly understand. So let's

00:10:15.510 --> 00:10:18.900
create the first crowd sourced cookbook.

00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:25.010
&gt;&gt;Presenter: So the goal was always to go
back to print 37 so it was going to be crowd

00:10:25.010 --> 00:10:26.010
source out the recipes.

00:10:26.010 --> 00:10:30.460
&gt;&gt;Amanda: Print was sort of -- that was part
of, but that wasn't our goal. Our goal was

00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:39.600
to build a business. We wanted to prove that
our theory was right and there was a business

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:45.390
worth building. And so, we felt like if all
we did was create a cookbook at the end of

00:10:45.390 --> 00:10:49.040
the year. And by the way the idea was to do
it in 52 weeks. Which is why we're called

00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:53.691
Food 52. And the beauty of that is that you
in 52 weeks you cover every season, every

00:10:53.691 --> 00:10:59.190
holiday and you get this nice number of recipes.
Because we were doing two contests per week.

00:10:59.190 --> 00:11:04.670
And so, and I'll get to the contests in a
second. But it was -- we knew that we could

00:11:04.670 --> 00:11:10.210
get a book contract so we went to Harper Collins.
We got a two book deal. We took our advance

00:11:10.210 --> 00:11:15.990
and we spent all of it on building our site
and getting our company started. So we felt

00:11:15.990 --> 00:11:20.640
like, if at the end of the year, we're like
there's not a business here we knew at the

00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:26.170
very least we could create a great book. And
I do think it turned out to be a very good

00:11:26.170 --> 00:11:35.230
book and has been reviewed very well. But
in -- during the course of that year, we saw,

00:11:35.230 --> 00:11:41.500
yes, indeed there was a business here. And
what was interesting was that, like, it wasn't

00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:48.610
just that we attracted people who knew -- like,
knew a lot about food, loved cooking and wanted

00:11:48.610 --> 00:11:56.430
a place to kind of convene with others, but
that food bloggers saw us as a complimentary

00:11:56.430 --> 00:12:02.149
platform for themselves. Like a place where
they could draw attention to their work and

00:12:02.149 --> 00:12:04.209
bring people back to their own sites.

00:12:04.209 --> 00:12:08.730
&gt;&gt;Presenter: So it's fascinating though that
you started with a book advance to build an

00:12:08.730 --> 00:12:13.149
online platform and then take it back to print.
So can you talk to us just a little bit about

00:12:13.149 --> 00:12:18.709
why did you feel like you wanted to go back
to print with it, ultimately if you solved

00:12:18.709 --> 00:12:22.589
the problem of how do you find recipes and
you've created this incredible site which

00:12:22.589 --> 00:12:27.380
we'll talk about in a few minutes, then why
put it back into book format.

00:12:27.380 --> 00:12:34.520
&gt;&gt;Amanda: Couple of reasons. One was like
a business reason. Nobody is going to give

00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:40.850
us money to just build a site. Yes, we could
do that, but I knew the issues involved with

00:12:40.850 --> 00:12:46.180
trying to raise money to do something like
that. Like, it would be better if we bootstrapped

00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:49.620
and then raised money later which is what
we did. But the other -- the main reason with

00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:54.630
the book was just that we felt very strongly
-- and of course this is two and a half years

00:12:54.630 --> 00:13:01.340
ago. We do actually feel differently now.
But at the time, our thinking was, you know,

00:13:01.340 --> 00:13:09.170
how often do you get the chance to contribute
to creating a physical object? You know? And

00:13:09.170 --> 00:13:15.230
I mean, I think a lot of people fantasize
about creating their own cookbook, but they

00:13:15.230 --> 00:13:22.440
have other jobs. Very few people have 100
plus original recipes in them. And there's

00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:26.430
nothing wrong with that. I mean, if you can
create ten great recipes, I think that's a

00:13:26.430 --> 00:13:31.330
great accomplishment. You know? So if you
can sort of collect a bunch of talented people,

00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:36.220
it's a way for everybody to have a say. And
the way our system works is we have recipe

00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:43.390
contests and that's the way we kind of curate
the book from an editorial perspective is

00:13:43.390 --> 00:13:49.260
we name recipe themes that we know over time
will go together to form a great book. We

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:54.430
name the themes. People send in their recipes.
We read every recipe. We have a team of testers

00:13:54.430 --> 00:13:59.320
who test the most promising ones. And then
we post the two finalists. And I will show

00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:05.190
you how this works. But then, anyone can vote.
So the beauty of this is that this isn't just

00:14:05.190 --> 00:14:10.120
a place for people who are creative cooks.
It's a place for people who have, you know,

00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:15.840
who are really opinionated about food to have
a say. Because by voting on a recipe, you

00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:19.209
are essentially editing a cookbook that's
going to be in Barnes and Noble and Amazon

00:14:19.209 --> 00:14:20.209
etcetera.

00:14:20.209 --> 00:14:22.680
&gt;&gt;Presenter: And so, what will the second
book be?

00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:25.540
&gt;&gt;Amanda: The second book? It will be another
Food 52 cookbook.

00:14:25.540 --> 00:14:27.480
&gt;&gt;Presenter: So another in a year of recipes.

00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:31.980
&gt;&gt;Amanda: Yes. So technically we should have
started our third book last September. And

00:14:31.980 --> 00:14:35.339
we decided instead to create an iPad app which
I'll show you as well.

00:14:35.339 --> 00:14:39.590
&gt;&gt;Presenter: Okay. Great so what's your favorite
recipe from the current book.

00:14:39.590 --> 00:14:42.019
&gt;&gt;Amanda: I can't say. It's like choosing
between your children.

00:14:42.019 --> 00:14:49.173
&gt;&gt;Presenter: I would totally choose between
my kids. I only have one. One's got to be

00:14:49.173 --> 00:14:50.490
your favorite. One's kind of your favorite.

00:14:50.490 --> 00:14:56.339
&gt;&gt;Amanda: There's so many that I like. I'm
just going to name one and I'm sure you know.

00:14:56.339 --> 00:15:02.740
I'll regret this later. But like fried chick
peas. I love it because you take a can of

00:15:02.740 --> 00:15:09.860
chick peas and you drain it and you shallow
fry it with sliced garlic, lemon zest and

00:15:09.860 --> 00:15:15.589
then when it comes -- you know when the chick
pea fries, it's skin kind of flips up so it's

00:15:15.589 --> 00:15:20.300
got these little crisp wings and it's nice
and soft in the center and crisp around the

00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:23.690
edges and you season it with salt and smoked
paprika.

00:15:23.690 --> 00:15:26.680
I mean It's so easy and everyone loves them.
Yeah.

00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:31.610
&gt;&gt;Presenter: You're making me very hungry.
These talks make me very hungry at lunchtime.

00:15:31.610 --> 00:15:35.680
That sounds good. And so, what recipe would
you recommend for Googlers or New Yorkers

00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:37.540
to try in their tiny New York kitchens.

00:15:37.540 --> 00:15:39.959
&gt;&gt;Amanda: That's a perfect one.

00:15:39.959 --> 00:15:43.980
&gt;&gt;Presenter: Chick peas and a frying pan.

00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:48.150
&gt;&gt;Amanda: It's not -- you can shallow fry
so you don't have to deep fry.

00:15:48.150 --> 00:15:52.540
&gt;&gt;Presenter: So you have some exciting new
things coming up with all the apps and all

00:15:52.540 --> 00:15:53.540
that.

00:15:53.540 --> 00:15:59.520
&gt;&gt;Amanda: I just want to show you what we're
up to and all that.

00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:02.420
&gt;&gt;Presenter: I'll be of no help..

00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:08.250
&gt;&gt;Amanda: All right. So this is great. Come
along. So this is our site. And I just want

00:16:08.250 --> 00:16:15.029
to give you kind of a quick tour on -- it's
very curated. So most of the pictures that

00:16:15.029 --> 00:16:20.410
you're seeing here on the home page, we take.
But they -- all of the recipes come from our

00:16:20.410 --> 00:16:25.780
community. So we launched our site with these
contests. And then, we also created our own

00:16:25.780 --> 00:16:31.950
content. And over time, we noticed that people
were talking to each other in the comments

00:16:31.950 --> 00:16:35.459
like answering each other's food questions,
their cooking questions, their answers were

00:16:35.459 --> 00:16:39.779
thorough, they were generous. We have a very
nice community which kind of freaks some people

00:16:39.779 --> 00:16:47.570
out. And you know, like, this observation
combined with the fact that for, you know,

00:16:47.570 --> 00:16:53.100
the decade and and a half that I had been
a food writer and editor, like, every relative

00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:57.790
every friend they e-mail me they call me when
I worked for the New York Times. Readers would

00:16:57.790 --> 00:17:03.950
call me at my desk and call me my cake looks
like it's going to flop, what do I do, which

00:17:03.950 --> 00:17:06.880
always amused me because I always thought
if I'm in the trouble in the kitchen, I don't

00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:11.169
think like I'm not going to call my local
newspaper or my national newspaper and ask

00:17:11.169 --> 00:17:12.409
for help. But people did.

00:17:12.409 --> 00:17:16.039
&gt;&gt;Presenter: I'm going to start doing that
though. I'm going to start calling you.

00:17:16.039 --> 00:17:22.839
&gt;&gt;Amanda: See, now we have hot line. So we
created Food 52 Hotline and the idea is you

00:17:22.839 --> 00:17:30.239
can ask any food or cooking question. You
can mark it as urgent. You -- and you can

00:17:30.239 --> 00:17:38.529
-- and the crowd answers. And so, the way
it works is -- I just want to show you. So

00:17:38.529 --> 00:17:44.789
there was a question that I wanted to highlight
earlier -- okay, here. Can I substitute honey

00:17:44.789 --> 00:17:54.279
for agave syrup? For stir fry. So this is
-- somebody we have iPads at Whole Foods Market

00:17:54.279 --> 00:17:59.600
stores around the country and somebody on
one of those iPads answered that question

00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:04.940
and as you can see two people think this is
an excellent answer. And the thing is you

00:18:04.940 --> 00:18:11.450
crowd source the answers and the crowd curates.
So that the person whose question it is can

00:18:11.450 --> 00:18:17.100
get a sense of like okay this is probably
the best answer. And then, also over time,

00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:22.859
you know as these questions come up in Google,
you know, somebody who's new to the site who

00:18:22.859 --> 00:18:27.559
has the same question can quickly see oh,
this is the answer I should pay attention

00:18:27.559 --> 00:18:34.269
to. We also have experts -- this is -- what
you're looking at is a very rudimentary form

00:18:34.269 --> 00:18:40.720
of this service. And we're going to spend
the next three to six months actually improving

00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:45.770
it vastly because it has proven to work very
well. Nobody else is doing it. And the thing

00:18:45.770 --> 00:18:50.580
about food and cooking questions is they're
different from other Q and A sites because

00:18:50.580 --> 00:18:57.720
they have this -- obviously you can Google
tons of food questions and get great answers.

00:18:57.720 --> 00:19:04.290
But you -- the thing about cooking is that
a lot of the answers are about experience.

00:19:04.290 --> 00:19:10.129
And these -- this is the voice of experience
here. And you, additionally, often you have

00:19:10.129 --> 00:19:14.489
a food and cooking question when you're in
the grocery store and you went to buy an ingredient

00:19:14.489 --> 00:19:17.660
for your recipe and they don't have it and
you can't think of a quick substitute. Or

00:19:17.660 --> 00:19:25.110
you're at the stove and things are not going
well and you need some help. This platform

00:19:25.110 --> 00:19:31.940
kind of serves that. So we have an iPhone
app. I want to quick show you that. Hopefully

00:19:31.940 --> 00:19:39.129
it will show up on this screen. I'm not sure
if this is going to be too small. We'll check

00:19:39.129 --> 00:19:45.559
it out. Oh, well, it's a little bit dark and
small. But the idea is so you can ask questions

00:19:45.559 --> 00:19:53.389
from your iPhone. And the other thing that
we do is that -- we have a very rudimentary

00:19:53.389 --> 00:19:58.109
reputation system which we'll be working on
which are these pies. And the fuller the pie

00:19:58.109 --> 00:20:04.940
the more trustworthy the person asking or
answering the question is. So, that's one

00:20:04.940 --> 00:20:16.429
thing. And we -- additionally we have is -- we
have experts. So people like Michael Ruhlman,

00:20:16.429 --> 00:20:23.320
Dorie Greenspan, Shuna Lydon, who's a great
pastry chef in New York City. They answer

00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:30.580
questions for us as well. So the idea for
this to become a place for people like them

00:20:30.580 --> 00:20:35.859
to reach another audience, but it's also a
great kind of treat for our audience to have

00:20:35.859 --> 00:20:43.460
kind of one of their food heroes answer questions.
And also elicit conversation. Because it's

00:20:43.460 --> 00:20:49.289
an open forum and it's not moderated lots
of sorts of things happen. For instance, at

00:20:49.289 --> 00:20:54.581
the holidays, somebody was like 'hey, let's
do a Food 52 secret Santa'. So 100 people

00:20:54.581 --> 00:21:00.220
in our community exchanged food gifts that
they made with each other around the country.

00:21:00.220 --> 00:21:04.280
So people they've never met except for on
the site, they sent food gifts to each other

00:21:04.280 --> 00:21:10.279
and they organized it all through the hot
line. So that's kind of fun. And then last

00:21:10.279 --> 00:21:13.610
thing I just wanted to show. Well, let me
see if I can actually get to our contest page

00:21:13.610 --> 00:21:18.049
which would be nice. No, not going to happen.

00:21:18.049 --> 00:21:23.019
&gt;&gt;Presenter: And it's even on Chrome so I
can't even make it show.

00:21:23.019 --> 00:21:28.179
&gt;&gt;Amanda: I know. What is up? I was just on
there. Look at the contests. They're great.

00:21:28.179 --> 00:21:34.080
[laughter] You know, I don't know what else
to say. But okay. So let's move on. Lastly,

00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:41.649
I want to show you an iPad. It's kind of like
an app. It's kind of like a book. We did it

00:21:41.649 --> 00:21:46.590
-- it's built on the Inkling platform and
we worked with Open Air Publishing. So after

00:21:46.590 --> 00:21:52.470
we finished our second book we thought, well
yes we could do a third book and a fourth

00:21:52.470 --> 00:21:57.309
book but there was like the time delay between
finishing the production of the book and actually

00:21:57.309 --> 00:22:04.479
having it come out was so long. It was actually
almost 18 months for the first book. Yeah,

00:22:04.479 --> 00:22:09.620
it was. And it's going to be 12 months for
our next book. And it just feels like we are

00:22:09.620 --> 00:22:15.110
a company that lives online and lives very
much in the present and this delay of 12 months

00:22:15.110 --> 00:22:21.019
just doesn't feel quite right. So we decided
to do an experiment. So in August, we decided

00:22:21.019 --> 00:22:26.450
well let's do a holiday app and let's crowd
source and curate not just recipes but entertaining

00:22:26.450 --> 00:22:31.110
tips and survival tips and let's make it a
survival guide for the holidays because even

00:22:31.110 --> 00:22:37.830
like experienced cooks get freaked out by
suddenly 12 family members coming over for

00:22:37.830 --> 00:22:47.990
dinner. And all of that. So we used our contests
system on our site to go do holiday-themed

00:22:47.990 --> 00:22:55.710
contests. And in nine weeks we created this
app -- it was in the app store. So it has

00:22:55.710 --> 00:23:02.700
75 recipes, 100 minutes of original video.
150 tips that we crowd sourced from our community.

00:23:02.700 --> 00:23:13.240
I just thought I'd show you a little bit of
it. So here is our drinks chapter. And you

00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:18.960
know the thing that's sort of nice about this
is you can just obviously, which we don't

00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:27.179
have on our site but it would be nice is you
can do little pop-ups and we -- oops-- we

00:23:27.179 --> 00:23:39.970
have step by step slide show. And we have
-- here you can ask the hot line any question

00:23:39.970 --> 00:23:49.280
from the app. I mean, you know it's nothing
like technically like exciting, but the thing

00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:54.090
is interesting to us is you can kind of do
these very focused topics around food and

00:23:54.090 --> 00:24:02.720
crowd source them and put them together very
quickly. And so, we charge $9.99 for this.

00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:09.029
And so, we have -- let me just show you a
couple of other things. We did a buying guide.

00:24:09.029 --> 00:24:16.590
So we, you know, curated all of this. These
link through to Amazon. We did menus. Hold

00:24:16.590 --> 00:24:23.929
on a second here. Here we go. So the idea
is here's like a traditional holiday menu.

00:24:23.929 --> 00:24:34.090
All of these recipes again come from our community.
And there you go. So we are obviously like

00:24:34.090 --> 00:24:41.279
we're not totally mainstream. We have a little
bit of higher end approach to food. And I

00:24:41.279 --> 00:24:46.559
think that increasingly we're kind of alone
in that online which we sort of feel is an

00:24:46.559 --> 00:24:47.820
advantage to us.

00:24:47.820 --> 00:24:52.190
&gt;&gt;Presenter: It's really beautiful. Thank
you. Looks really gorgeous. Are you going

00:24:52.190 --> 00:24:56.919
to be doing anything for Android? Will you
be moving to Android?

00:24:56.919 --> 00:24:59.100
&gt;&gt;Amanda: Probably. Not yet.

00:24:59.100 --> 00:25:00.100
Yeah.

00:25:00.100 --> 00:25:01.100
&gt;&gt;Presenter: So what's next.

00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:07.440
&gt;&gt;Amanda: So we are working on -- what is
next? Well, we're going to spend a lot of

00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:12.840
time on hot line because we just have seen,
I think, mostly through the app that like

00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:18.139
people the adoption from the app is really
great and we've basically haven't publicized

00:25:18.139 --> 00:25:25.070
it at all and people use it a lot. So, you
know, and there's just like little things.

00:25:25.070 --> 00:25:28.379
If you follow Mario Batali on Twitter, he
answers food questions a lot.

00:25:28.379 --> 00:25:29.379
&gt;&gt;Presenter: Yeah, all the time

00:25:29.379 --> 00:25:36.869
&gt;&gt;Amanda: A lot of chefs do that. Nearly every
site now does the Thanksgiving 101 or the

00:25:36.869 --> 00:25:43.210
Thanksgiving hot line or whatever. People
cook every day of the year. And so, we just

00:25:43.210 --> 00:25:48.210
feel like it's a great opportunity for us.
Because we basically have built the foundation

00:25:48.210 --> 00:25:49.210
for it.

00:25:49.210 --> 00:25:53.120
&gt;&gt;Presenter: So just to continue to sort of
build all these pieces out that you've already

00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:54.120
got.

00:25:54.120 --> 00:25:58.059
&gt;&gt;Amanda: Yeah. Yeah. You know because we
do -- we tend to like a company do the -- you

00:25:58.059 --> 00:26:04.669
know we like -- we experiment a lot and we
put things up not unfinished all the time.

00:26:04.669 --> 00:26:13.110
And so, like that has been evolving for like
a year. And now it's starting to get traction.

00:26:13.110 --> 00:26:16.919
It's given us time to sort of see if we were
going to make this great, how would we do

00:26:16.919 --> 00:26:17.919
it.

00:26:17.919 --> 00:26:23.149
&gt;&gt;Presenter: It looks great already. Before
we turn it over to questions from the audience

00:26:23.149 --> 00:26:27.210
which I'm sure there are a few burning. Well,
you can ask your food questions through the

00:26:27.210 --> 00:26:31.289
app. You all know that now. So don't ask food
questions unless you're also going to tweet

00:26:31.289 --> 00:26:37.279
it to your app or e-mail it or whatever. So
I have a couple of blanks -- fill-in-the-blanks

00:26:37.279 --> 00:26:38.279
for you..

00:26:38.279 --> 00:26:39.320
&gt;&gt;Amanda: Okay, great.

00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:42.489
&gt;&gt;Presenter: Crowd sourcing is.

00:26:42.489 --> 00:26:46.129
&gt;&gt;Amanda: is community building.

00:26:46.129 --> 00:26:48.179
&gt;&gt;Presenter: Print is

00:26:48.179 --> 00:26:50.070
&gt;&gt;Amanda: wilting.

00:26:50.070 --> 00:26:53.849
&gt;&gt;Presenter: Diplomatic answer.
[laughter]

00:26:53.849 --> 00:26:57.639
&gt;&gt;Presenter: Julia Child is....

00:26:57.639 --> 00:26:59.529
&gt;&gt;Amanda: Difficult.

00:26:59.529 --> 00:27:01.369
&gt;&gt;Presenter: Food bloggers are

00:27:01.369 --> 00:27:03.609
&gt;&gt;Amanda: Energetic.

00:27:03.609 --> 00:27:07.759
&gt;&gt;Presenter: My favorite thing about New York
is

00:27:07.759 --> 00:27:15.909
&gt;&gt;Amanda: The people.

00:27:15.909 --> 00:27:19.729
&gt;&gt;Presenter: A food trend I like is

00:27:19.729 --> 00:27:22.729
&gt;&gt;Amanda: Growing your own.

00:27:22.729 --> 00:27:25.429
&gt;&gt;Presenter: A food trend I hate is

00:27:25.429 --> 00:27:31.700
&gt;&gt;Amanda: Oh, like, obsession with hamburgers.
[laughter]

00:27:31.700 --> 00:27:36.830
&gt;&gt;Presenter: You're the second person that's
said something about hamburgers. Andrew Carmellini

00:27:36.830 --> 00:27:41.440
also said something about hamburgers, I don't
know why. But then he said I love Hamburgers.

00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:45.519
So we never got to the bottom of that. We'll
have to ask him. If you see him, ask him.

00:27:45.519 --> 00:27:46.519
I don't know what the deal is.

00:27:46.519 --> 00:27:50.369
&gt;&gt;Amanda: It's more like this obsession over
like the minute details of pizza and hamburgers.

00:27:50.369 --> 00:27:54.830
&gt;&gt;Presenter: About like what goes in?
&gt;&gt;Amanda: Not that it's not interesting. It's

00:27:54.830 --> 00:28:00.789
just like every single publication has done
like the, you know, we've explored, you know,

00:28:00.789 --> 00:28:05.539
the depths of the burger and here's everything
you need to know. I'm like, I'm tired.

00:28:05.539 --> 00:28:07.529
&gt;&gt;Presenter: I figure I know it.
&gt;&gt;Amanda: Yeah [giggles]

00:28:07.529 --> 00:28:08.529
&gt;&gt;Presenter: Food trucks are

00:28:08.529 --> 00:28:17.700
&gt;&gt;Amanda: Okay. I mean, they're not as good
as they are in Asia, but they don't really

00:28:17.700 --> 00:28:18.700
have trucks. [laughter]

00:28:18.700 --> 00:28:21.200
&gt;&gt;Presenter: Reality chef competitions are.

00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:24.730
&gt;&gt;Amanda: Oh, fun. I like them. Fan. I'm only
supposed to do one word, right? So kind of

00:28:24.730 --> 00:28:25.730
cheating.

00:28:25.730 --> 00:28:32.539
&gt;&gt;Presenter: Oh you can have as many as you
want. There's no rules for launching and iterating

00:28:32.539 --> 00:28:36.230
this whole process. You can do whatever you
want. Most surprising thing to me about Google

00:28:36.230 --> 00:28:38.559
is

00:28:38.559 --> 00:28:45.389
&gt;&gt;Amanda: I haven't really -- I mean, about
it as a company or your offices? I haven't

00:28:45.389 --> 00:28:53.710
seen that much of it, but -- umm -- some surprising
thing.

00:28:53.710 --> 00:28:57.710
&gt;&gt;Presenter: Well, actually I'll ask you a
question. I remember when we came up with

00:28:57.710 --> 00:28:58.710
recipe search.

00:28:58.710 --> 00:29:04.310
&gt;&gt;Amanda: Well, I was just thinking about
that. Yeah, well -- it's not because it's

00:29:04.310 --> 00:29:09.090
going to sound like a complaint. But even
Google hasn't figured out recipe search.

00:29:09.090 --> 00:29:13.190
&gt;&gt;Presenter: But now you have. So there you
go. We created a business opportunity for

00:29:13.190 --> 00:29:14.190
you.

00:29:14.190 --> 00:29:16.100
&gt;&gt;Amanda: So I should thank you.

00:29:16.100 --> 00:29:17.759
&gt;&gt;Presenter: You're welcome.
[laughter]

00:29:17.759 --> 00:29:22.190
&gt;&gt;Presenter: Okay, so how are we doing on
time because I want to make sure we have time

00:29:22.190 --> 00:29:26.799
for questions. A couple more minutes? So a
couple of cooking at home questions because

00:29:26.799 --> 00:29:31.409
this is all about home cooks. If I came to
your home for dinner and I'm not angling for

00:29:31.409 --> 00:29:36.509
an invitation, but I'm free on Friday in case
you're wondering what would you make?

00:29:36.509 --> 00:29:44.009
&gt;&gt;Amanda: Well, I've become much less ambitious
mostly because I was driving my husband crazy

00:29:44.009 --> 00:29:55.219
with too many courses. I was getting too stressed
out. So I would probably make like -- I like,

00:29:55.219 --> 00:29:59.109
like, kind of shaved salads. Like I'm kind
of into trying. I like the challenge of something

00:29:59.109 --> 00:30:05.090
-- taking something like kale or a sturdier
vegetable and making an interesting salad

00:30:05.090 --> 00:30:12.640
out of it. I really like slow roasted fish.
It's actually like my -- for you, I would

00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:17.690
make something more special. It's my lazy
out. I don't want to have to worry about the

00:30:17.690 --> 00:30:23.029
main course like giving me a hard time. So
I like slow roast fish and then I do like

00:30:23.029 --> 00:30:28.330
more interesting things around it. But I would
make you my mother-in-law's almond cake.

00:30:28.330 --> 00:30:30.749
&gt;&gt;Presenter: Oh, I'll come. Tomorrow.

00:30:30.749 --> 00:30:31.749
&gt;&gt;Amanda: Okay.

00:30:31.749 --> 00:30:33.659
&gt;&gt;Presenter: That sounds good. Almond cake.

00:30:33.659 --> 00:30:34.659
&gt;&gt;Amanda: It's really good..

00:30:34.659 --> 00:30:35.659
&gt;&gt;Presenter: Is it in the book.

00:30:35.659 --> 00:30:38.729
&gt;&gt;Amanda: I actually call it my thank you
cake. I've sent it across the country many

00:30:38.729 --> 00:30:42.349
times. If there's somebody who has helped
me out or I want to thank somebody, I make

00:30:42.349 --> 00:30:47.359
it. . Because it gets better with time So
you can send it. It's in actually the New

00:30:47.359 --> 00:30:52.090
York Times Cookbook and Cooking for Mr. Latte
but the better version is in the New York

00:30:52.090 --> 00:30:53.090
Times Cookbook.

00:30:53.090 --> 00:30:54.809
&gt;&gt;Presenter: You held out for Mr. Latte? Saved
an ingredient.

00:30:54.809 --> 00:30:59.029
&gt;&gt;Amanda: I improved it. No, we figured out
a new technique. Yeah.

00:30:59.029 --> 00:31:02.190
&gt;&gt;Presenter: Nice. What is in your fridge
right now?

00:31:02.190 --> 00:31:07.669
&gt;&gt; Amanda: Meyer lemons. Somebody sends me
Meyer Lemons every holiday and then it makes

00:31:07.669 --> 00:31:16.860
me really happy. Julia child's creme caramel,
which we were doing -- we made because we

00:31:16.860 --> 00:31:24.580
were going to do a series for YouTube about
like how to tell -- because we figured out

00:31:24.580 --> 00:31:31.419
that like all these questions on hot line,
like are this perfect resource for like what

00:31:31.419 --> 00:31:34.980
do cooks worry about, right? And so, we're
going to do a series of videos for YouTube

00:31:34.980 --> 00:31:38.809
that answers these questions. Everyone is
always asking questions like when is x done?

00:31:38.809 --> 00:31:44.369
When is y ready? Like you know how can I tell
my pastry dough is ready? How can I tell if

00:31:44.369 --> 00:31:50.120
the cake is done? How can I tell when my custard
is done? That's like a classic one. It gets

00:31:50.120 --> 00:31:55.529
asked once a week on the hot line. So we made
her creme caramel. We undercooked it, cooked

00:31:55.529 --> 00:31:59.450
it, over cooked it, and made a perfect version
and videoed each version.

00:31:59.450 --> 00:32:01.200
&gt;&gt;Presenter: How nice? That's a good idea.

00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:02.710
&gt;&gt;Amanda: And then we ate it.

00:32:02.710 --> 00:32:07.220
&gt;&gt;Presenter: And then it's all in your plate.
Who does the dishes?

00:32:07.220 --> 00:32:09.929
&gt;&gt;Amanda: My husband actually. Yeah.

00:32:09.929 --> 00:32:13.749
&gt;&gt;Presenter: Well trained. What is the one
thing you always make at home?

00:32:13.749 --> 00:32:21.309
&gt;&gt;Amanda: That I always make at home? I have
a couple of favorites. There's like a pancake

00:32:21.309 --> 00:32:27.200
recipe. It's called heavenly hots. Which sounds
like a late night cable offering.

00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:30.849
&gt;&gt;Presenter: It does, a little bit.
&gt;&gt;Amanda: But it's -- they're made with sour

00:32:30.849 --> 00:32:36.909
cream and they're really super delicate. They
basically have just enough flour to bind them

00:32:36.909 --> 00:32:42.659
and they have a lot of eggs in them. And they're
tiny little things and they puff up like little

00:32:42.659 --> 00:32:46.409
soufflés and they taste like they have cream
in the middle because they have so much sour

00:32:46.409 --> 00:32:49.599
cream, that's essentially the liquid. Those
are really good.

00:32:49.599 --> 00:32:52.330
&gt;&gt;Presenter: Nice. You can make those for
me, too.

00:32:52.330 --> 00:32:53.590
&gt;&gt;Amanda: OK. No problem.

00:32:53.590 --> 00:32:57.200
&gt;&gt;Presenter: What is one restaurant -- this
is sort of off cooking at home but if your

00:32:57.200 --> 00:33:03.389
at my home, we do eat out a lot what's the
one restaurant that nobody knows about that

00:33:03.389 --> 00:33:06.909
they should?

00:33:06.909 --> 00:33:13.720
&gt;&gt;Amanda: I feel like, well, there's this
chef who I like very much. And I -- I'm going

00:33:13.720 --> 00:33:23.320
to butcher the name because it's Basque but
Txikito. It's actually on Ninth Avenue at

00:33:23.320 --> 00:33:31.360
like 21st. It's right next to Ko, thank you.
Yeah, and she used to be at another tapas

00:33:31.360 --> 00:33:34.419
place but she's a really good chef. Love her.
Yeah.

00:33:34.419 --> 00:33:36.889
&gt;&gt;Presenter: Well, now we know about it.

00:33:36.889 --> 00:33:38.299
&gt;&gt;Amanda: There you go.

00:33:38.299 --> 00:33:44.390
&gt;&gt;Presenter: So I would love to turn it over
for questions if anyone has questions.

00:33:44.390 --> 00:33:54.159
&gt;&gt;female #1: Hi there. Dying to get your thoughts
on if you are kind of like venturing into

00:33:54.159 --> 00:34:01.479
the cooking world slowly but trying. What
recommendations do you have resources whatever

00:34:01.479 --> 00:34:07.169
to kind of like build that experience. I mean,
obviously you have to just practice, but you

00:34:07.169 --> 00:34:12.310
have any other recommendations for kind of
getting better at cooking.

00:34:12.310 --> 00:34:25.510
&gt;&gt;Just like for home cooking -- not like professionally.
I actually feel like if you find like even

00:34:25.510 --> 00:34:30.750
if it's just. I think it's nice to have one
cookbook or one recipe source that you kind

00:34:30.750 --> 00:34:34.980
of cook a lot from because you kind of develop
a relationship with it and I think it's really

00:34:34.980 --> 00:34:39.591
important when you start out rather than hopping
all over the place because I think then you

00:34:39.591 --> 00:34:44.010
get overwhelmed and you get lots of different
opinions. If you just start out with one place

00:34:44.010 --> 00:34:51.120
where you get comfortable and then -- like
something like do you like Heidi Swanson,

00:34:51.120 --> 00:34:58.590
Super Natural Cooking? She has a blog, an
incredibly popular blog called 101 Cookbooks

00:34:58.590 --> 00:35:04.360
and she's a really good cook. Nothing super
complicated and she has two good cookbooks

00:35:04.360 --> 00:35:10.370
out. So I would think somebody like her would
be worth trying out.

00:35:10.370 --> 00:35:12.950
&gt;&gt;female #1: Thank you.

00:35:12.950 --> 00:35:14.890
&gt;&gt;Amanda: You're welcome.

00:35:14.890 --> 00:35:20.340
&gt;&gt;male #1: Thanks for coming today. Question
about the contests and I think earlier you

00:35:20.340 --> 00:35:26.860
said with your contests you have recipes submitted
that are original recipes and you made a comment

00:35:26.860 --> 00:35:31.820
earlier about if somebody had ten original
recipes that's kind of like an accomplishment.

00:35:31.820 --> 00:35:36.920
How do you guys define. How do you determine
what is really original and what isn't in

00:35:36.920 --> 00:35:40.460
terms of recipes that people document and
put out.

00:35:40.460 --> 00:35:46.720
&gt;&gt;Amanda: We do define in on the site because
it is -- it's a really great question. And

00:35:46.720 --> 00:35:52.701
it -- there is -- like, in terms of copyright.
The only thing you can copyright in the recipe

00:35:52.701 --> 00:35:58.890
are the steps, not the ingredients. So you
can't copyright the thing as a whole. And

00:35:58.890 --> 00:36:04.150
so, there's like a lot of -- there's a big
gray area. To us it's not that gray, because

00:36:04.150 --> 00:36:12.630
we feel like every recipe is inspired by one
or many, many recipes or other influences.

00:36:12.630 --> 00:36:18.540
And that's sort of like -- we -- our goal
is to actually celebrate that narrative because

00:36:18.540 --> 00:36:22.950
that's the history of cooking, right? So the
idea that you're going to just like walk into

00:36:22.950 --> 00:36:25.832
your kitchen I'm going to grab a little bit
of this, grab a little bit of that and I'm

00:36:25.832 --> 00:36:28.690
going to measure and I'm going to write my
own recipe. Some people do that. Very few

00:36:28.690 --> 00:36:32.830
people do. It's usually that they've been
making Marcella Hazan's walnut cake for a

00:36:32.830 --> 00:36:37.090
decade and they've decided you know what?
I just want do it with pistachios and I'm

00:36:37.090 --> 00:36:43.020
going to add some lemon zest. You're building
on this foundation that Marcella Hazan and

00:36:43.020 --> 00:36:52.010
probably somebody before her built, right?
And so, that's great. What we do is like we

00:36:52.010 --> 00:37:00.220
have a couple of -- like, the way we built
our recipe entry form was very specific to

00:37:00.220 --> 00:37:06.430
kind of resolving this issue. Or addressing
it, I should say. But also to keep the quality

00:37:06.430 --> 00:37:10.660
high. Like, people say to us it's a pain in
the neck to up load a recipe to your site.

00:37:10.660 --> 00:37:16.490
And we're like, good. Because we have 15,000
recipes have been unloaded to our site which

00:37:16.490 --> 00:37:20.100
isn't a huge number but the quality is super
high because you have to make a commitment

00:37:20.100 --> 00:37:24.200
to do it, right? And that's step one. Because
if you're just ripping off somebody's recipe,

00:37:24.200 --> 00:37:28.780
you're probably not going to take the effort
to copy it again [laughs] onto somebody else's

00:37:28.780 --> 00:37:33.140
site. But additionally we ask you tell us
about your recipe. Where did it come from?

00:37:33.140 --> 00:37:37.180
What influences did you have? Tell us the
story of your recipe. So that's one way we

00:37:37.180 --> 00:37:42.711
can tell if somebody has done it. But you
know like changing like two ingredients. You

00:37:42.711 --> 00:37:48.070
kind of know if it's a different thing. Like,
basically, like, you can tell it's your own

00:37:48.070 --> 00:37:57.390
recipe when you -- like, when your personal
voice ends up in the recipe, you know what

00:37:57.390 --> 00:38:03.280
I mean? In the instructions you can tell this
step is ready when the butter starts to brown

00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:06.770
because you've done it. It's from your own
personal experience. So I think when you're

00:38:06.770 --> 00:38:11.130
adding that personal experience to your recipe,
it starts to become yours. Yeah.

00:38:11.130 --> 00:38:13.440
&gt;&gt;male #1: Thanksgiving
&gt;&gt;Amanda: Yeah

00:38:13.440 --> 00:38:14.820
&gt;&gt;female #2: Hello.

00:38:14.820 --> 00:38:15.820
&gt;&gt;Amanda: Hi

00:38:15.820 --> 00:38:20.240
&gt;&gt;female #2: So I'm in the middle of -- I'm
really curious about this. I'm in the middle

00:38:20.240 --> 00:38:26.971
of transitioning my recipes when I cook from
index cards which is how I was raised. My

00:38:26.971 --> 00:38:28.630
mom used to do index cards.

00:38:28.630 --> 00:38:29.630
&gt;&gt;Amanda: Wow. Old School

00:38:29.630 --> 00:38:33.310
&gt;&gt;female #2: Total old school. This started
a couple years ago. But I've transitioned

00:38:33.310 --> 00:38:40.030
now from index to notebooks to note pads to
computer. Now they're just all over the place.

00:38:40.030 --> 00:38:46.170
So my question for you is two fold. When you
are cooking, creating recipes, or editing.

00:38:46.170 --> 00:38:50.940
Where do you put the information? Do you do
it digitally or do you still write it out.

00:38:50.940 --> 00:38:56.480
And second, do you know of any sites that
are around that can actually foster this process

00:38:56.480 --> 00:39:02.410
that you can actually take your information
and put it into store for your own personal

00:39:02.410 --> 00:39:03.410
use.

00:39:03.410 --> 00:39:07.560
&gt;&gt;Amanda: There's this new site and I'm sorry
I just haven't had much experience with it,

00:39:07.560 --> 00:39:12.450
I've mostly just read about it. Paprika, it's
called and it's supposed to address it. A

00:39:12.450 --> 00:39:17.240
lot of people like Evernote recipes. I was
just thinking you can even take pictures of

00:39:17.240 --> 00:39:26.050
those cards and then like index them on or
sort them on Evernote but I mean unfortunately

00:39:26.050 --> 00:39:30.721
I'm not a great person to ask this because
I tend to write recipes for publication. So

00:39:30.721 --> 00:39:39.540
I'm usually like writing it into a CMS or,
you know, into a word doc that I'm going to

00:39:39.540 --> 00:39:42.560
hand into an editor. You know what I mean?
So I actually have terribly organized recipes.

00:39:42.560 --> 00:39:46.780
When I want to find my recipes, I go to the
New York Times archives.

00:39:46.780 --> 00:39:47.780
[laughter]

00:39:47.780 --> 00:39:51.310
&gt;&gt;Presenter: You call the new food editor.
Hey, how do I make this.

00:39:51.310 --> 00:39:53.660
&gt;&gt;female #2: Interesting. Thanks.

00:39:53.660 --> 00:39:54.840
&gt;&gt;Amanda: Sure.

00:39:54.840 --> 00:40:00.730
&gt;&gt;male #2: Hi. You have a very focused recipe
collection like you said. It seems very high

00:40:00.730 --> 00:40:06.950
end, American-ish. If you expand your recipe
base and your crowd are you going to change

00:40:06.950 --> 00:40:09.990
or lose your community? Because that is one
of the things that makes it special.

00:40:09.990 --> 00:40:15.210
&gt;&gt;Amanda: Yeah. I don't think so. I mean,
I think we already have one of our very active

00:40:15.210 --> 00:40:24.770
community members lives in Kerala, India.
He has obviously, you know, very kind of specific

00:40:24.770 --> 00:40:30.260
approach -- he cooks only southern Indian
food. But that hasn't like. People actually

00:40:30.260 --> 00:40:37.011
welcome that. But I think if we were to grow
very large, sub communities would form. You

00:40:37.011 --> 00:40:38.011
know.

00:40:38.011 --> 00:40:40.240
&gt;&gt;male #3: Thanks for coming.

00:40:40.240 --> 00:40:41.240
&gt;&gt;Amanda: Thanks for having me.

00:40:41.240 --> 00:40:46.990
&gt;&gt;male #3: You talked about how you got started
with food in general traveled around Europe.

00:40:46.990 --> 00:40:53.971
Sounds like you had the ability to maybe study
under certain chefs and do things like that.

00:40:53.971 --> 00:40:59.630
And I assume that helped you in your cooking
career. Most people probably don't have that

00:40:59.630 --> 00:41:08.840
type of opportunity. And how possible is it
do you think to be a good chef? To be maybe

00:41:08.840 --> 00:41:15.240
a great home cook if you don't have that and
you do you know have access to watching TV

00:41:15.240 --> 00:41:20.440
shows, access to the sites like Food 52. How
important was that in shaping what you've

00:41:20.440 --> 00:41:21.440
been able to do.

00:41:21.440 --> 00:41:22.520
&gt;&gt;Amanda: You mean like working in actual
kitchens.

00:41:22.520 --> 00:41:24.210
&gt;&gt;male #3: And traveling.

00:41:24.210 --> 00:41:29.700
&gt;&gt;Amanda: I did it in like a very scrappy
way. I got a scholarship. I could not have

00:41:29.700 --> 00:41:36.610
just dashed off to Europe or whatever. So
you know I got a small scholarship. And then,

00:41:36.610 --> 00:41:43.440
when you work in restaurants in Europe, you
work six days a week. So all I need. I didn't

00:41:43.440 --> 00:41:47.940
need any money except for a place to stay
and often restaurants will put you up if you're

00:41:47.940 --> 00:42:00.460
like a foreigner. I lived in some weird places,
but yeah. But anyway. So but, yeah, like,

00:42:00.460 --> 00:42:05.530
I mean the thing about going and working at
restaurant, it kick starts your education.

00:42:05.530 --> 00:42:11.730
I wouldn't say it's the most positive education,
because you learn everything by making mistakes

00:42:11.730 --> 00:42:18.550
and being yelled at. So like I think -- also
like, I mean, now food television didn't exist

00:42:18.550 --> 00:42:27.910
then. So had I had access to that, maybe that
would have been a great way to do it. I mean,

00:42:27.910 --> 00:42:33.850
now they have like Food Network has, Food
Network -- I'm sorry not Food Network -- Top

00:42:33.850 --> 00:42:39.510
Chef has like Top Chef University -- an app
where it's like you can learn to cook. They're

00:42:39.510 --> 00:42:44.940
not cheap. They're like 200 bucks a year or
something. I actually think. I mean, if you

00:42:44.940 --> 00:42:48.760
can work nights in a restaurant. It's just
a a great experience. I always think everybody

00:42:48.760 --> 00:42:53.510
should work in a restaurant at some point
in their life because they're fascinating.

00:42:53.510 --> 00:42:57.060
You know, they're like theaters.

00:42:57.060 --> 00:43:00.360
&gt;&gt;Presenter: I agree. They're totally like
theaters. I worked in two restaurants the

00:43:00.360 --> 00:43:06.440
same way. It's amazing experience because
it's like watching finely tuned symphony in

00:43:06.440 --> 00:43:11.050
the back of the restaurant and then you also
realize what you should not do as a customer

00:43:11.050 --> 00:43:13.990
because it will piss off the kitchen.

00:43:13.990 --> 00:43:17.800
&gt;&gt;Amanda: Everyone should be a waitress so
you're not rude to servers anymore. But the

00:43:17.800 --> 00:43:24.810
thing is like restaurant cooking, though,
there's so much repetition you're not actually.

00:43:24.810 --> 00:43:28.570
You're never going to learn a huge amount
at any one restaurant. So in some ways you'd

00:43:28.570 --> 00:43:29.970
have to supplement it anyhow.

00:43:29.970 --> 00:43:33.540
&gt;&gt;male #3: Without having that experience.

00:43:33.540 --> 00:43:38.710
&gt;&gt;Amanda: Oh, definitely. I just think that
like cooking and eating is all about experience.

00:43:38.710 --> 00:43:44.000
When people say they want to become food writers,
one of the things I say never eat the same

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:51.220
meal twice. Make that extra effort to go to
that new place or to try to cook something

00:43:51.220 --> 00:43:57.060
else rather than like you know your old standby
because it's really about exploring and experiencing

00:43:57.060 --> 00:44:00.560
and that's the only way you kind of become
knowledgeable. Yeah.

00:44:00.560 --> 00:44:08.510
&gt;&gt;female #3: Hi. I loved your chapter in Cooking
for Mr. Latte on dining alone. And I'm wondering

00:44:08.510 --> 00:44:13.410
now that you're married and I think have a
child, do you still find time to do that and

00:44:13.410 --> 00:44:20.610
if so what are your new, I guess, go to spots
for dining alone because you can't do that

00:44:20.610 --> 00:44:22.050
in every restaurant.

00:44:22.050 --> 00:44:28.840
&gt;&gt;Amanda: Oh, I haven't done it in so long.
Wow. You say you can't do it in restaurants.

00:44:28.840 --> 00:44:34.910
&gt;&gt;female #:3 No, no -- you can. . But I think
there's certain restaurants that lend themselves

00:44:34.910 --> 00:44:37.920
better to going and just having a nice meal
alone.

00:44:37.920 --> 00:44:41.900
&gt;&gt;Amanda: Well, the thing I feel about New
York is a lot of restaurants have nice bars

00:44:41.900 --> 00:44:50.130
you can eat at. That's really nice. I mean,
one of my favorite spots, you know, and I

00:44:50.130 --> 00:44:58.260
think I even mention -- I mean, I do love
Craft -- like their bars as a great bar for

00:44:58.260 --> 00:45:05.190
eating at. You know where I would go, Maialino
because they have a really nice bar and a

00:45:05.190 --> 00:45:10.850
nice menu and you have this view and it's
I feel like it's the kind of place where you

00:45:10.850 --> 00:45:11.850
wouldn't feel self-conscious.

00:45:11.850 --> 00:45:13.230
&gt;&gt;female #3: I love that place so good recommendation.

00:45:13.230 --> 00:45:17.570
&gt;&gt;Amanda: Oh, okay I'm sorry. Wish I could
give you a secret new spot.

00:45:17.570 --> 00:45:18.570
[laughter]

00:45:18.570 --> 00:45:20.370
&gt;&gt;female #3: No, that's okay. Thanks
[laughter]

00:45:20.370 --> 00:45:22.470
&gt;&gt;Amanda: Yeah, thanks for having me.

00:45:22.470 --> 00:45:23.520
&gt;&gt;Presenter: You're back.

00:45:23.520 --> 00:45:28.980
&gt;&gt;male #1: I actually have kind of a follow
up question about go to places. Being a New

00:45:28.980 --> 00:45:34.470
Yorker who doesn't have a backyard that I
could grow anything, where do you go locally

00:45:34.470 --> 00:45:38.140
for meats or where do you shop basically.

00:45:38.140 --> 00:45:43.120
&gt;&gt;Amanda: Well, I have this terrible experience
last weekend. Which was I live in Brooklyn

00:45:43.120 --> 00:45:48.830
Heights and on Cadman Plaza, there is a farmers'
market on the weekends. During the week, too,

00:45:48.830 --> 00:45:54.170
but I'm never there then. Lie, I showed up
last weekend. It's like a family ritual. We

00:45:54.170 --> 00:45:58.780
take our kids. They run around; I shop blah,
blah, blah. They'd wiped out like half of

00:45:58.780 --> 00:46:04.470
the vendors. And it just, I guess, the community
can't support it but that's where I would

00:46:04.470 --> 00:46:09.710
get. There was a great fish guy vegetables,
blah, blah, blah. But grocery shopping in

00:46:09.710 --> 00:46:15.240
Brooklyn Heights is not exciting otherwise.
I just tend to like, you know, I might go

00:46:15.240 --> 00:46:22.741
to Whole Foods. I might go to Union Market.
You know, FreshDirect. Food 52, we kind of

00:46:22.741 --> 00:46:28.340
rely on FreshDirect like a lot. Yeah, I know
those delivery guys well. Yeah.

00:46:28.340 --> 00:46:33.110
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Presenter: Any other questions? Great, well

00:46:33.110 --> 00:46:34.110
thank you so much.
&gt;&gt;male #4: I have a question

00:46:34.110 --> 00:46:35.110
&gt;&gt;Oh, sorry.

00:46:35.110 --> 00:46:39.480
&gt;&gt;male #4: Yeah, sorry about that. So, you
actually make recipes submitted from people

00:46:39.480 --> 00:46:42.291
on the Internet. What are some of the recipes
that have totally missed the mark, like they

00:46:42.291 --> 00:46:46.870
sounded great from the ingredients and the
steps when you actually made them they didn't

00:46:46.870 --> 00:46:50.220
turn out as good as you thought it would.
&gt;&gt;Presenter: Mmmmm, that's a good question.

00:46:50.220 --> 00:46:56.500
&gt;&gt;Amanda: It happens all the time. It's very
funny because when we were -- I did this book

00:46:56.500 --> 00:47:01.640
called the Essential New York Times Cookbook.
It was like recipes from the entire New York

00:47:01.640 --> 00:47:04.963
Times archive which is 150 years. And there
was one recipe actually of mine we were thinking

00:47:04.963 --> 00:47:09.800
of putting it in. I was like, ah, you know
I haven't made that in a while; let's make

00:47:09.800 --> 00:47:17.741
it. And it was so terrible. It's like everybody
does it. Every week, we find obviously we

00:47:17.741 --> 00:47:24.000
find clunkers. But you know we've read, I
mean, thousands of recipes at this point so

00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:29.110
we're kind of better at like knowing like
pushing aside the clunkers right away. But

00:47:29.110 --> 00:47:35.800
for the most part they're -- recipes tend
to be clunkers only because people are not

00:47:35.800 --> 00:47:39.810
-- especially on our site, only because they're
not professional recipe writers and they forget

00:47:39.810 --> 00:47:45.220
to put a key detail in. They forget to tell
you to add water to a soup or whatever it

00:47:45.220 --> 00:47:53.170
is. You know? So it tends to be stuff like
that. But we don't change recipes. We won't

00:47:53.170 --> 00:47:58.090
improve your recipe. So if it's bad, it's
going to stay bad.

00:47:58.090 --> 00:48:03.390
&gt;&gt;male #4: A little bit more butter, little
bit more salt.

00:48:03.390 --> 00:48:05.800
&gt;&gt;Amanda: Yeah, we let the commenters do that.
But we ask them to be civil.

00:48:05.800 --> 00:48:11.220
&gt;&gt;male #4: Does one recipe stick out in your
mind as a real clunker.

00:48:11.220 --> 00:48:14.870
&gt;&gt;Amanda: Not a single one. Sorry. Yeah yeah
yeah.

00:48:14.870 --> 00:48:17.960
&gt;&gt;Presenter: Great. Well thank you so much
for your time, Amanda. That was great.

00:48:17.960 --> 00:48:19.110
&gt;&gt;Amanda: Thank you so much for having me.

00:48:19.110 --> 00:48:19.260
[Applause].
