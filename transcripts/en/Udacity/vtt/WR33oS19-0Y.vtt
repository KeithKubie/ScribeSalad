00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Now, a simple way for you to start

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
with your customer segment hypotheses is rank

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
each job according to what you believe

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
is its significance to the customer.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
And you get to guess on day 1 is it crucial or trivial?

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
And take a guess about how frequently it occurs,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
and outline what specific context a job gets done.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
I call this the day in the life of a customer.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
That is, you ultimately ought to be able to go up

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
to a white board and diagram for me or anybody else

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
here's what a customer does from the moment they get up

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
to when they go to work or when they're at school or something else,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
and here are the products they use and the car they drive

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
and what they read, et cetera, and if you really don't have a deep understanding

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
of that customer and where your product fits

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
you're really going to have a hard time understanding them.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Now, just remember on day 1 all you're mostly doing

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
is guessing, but the whole objective

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
of getting out of the building is trying to fill in

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
this day in the life, so actually when you say something

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
about here's how we ought to go advertise to them or reach them

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
or get Google AdWords to them that you're just not saying

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
it's because I think so.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
It's because you're saying I've spoken to a ton of these people,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
and they'd love to buy our stuff, but here's how we reach them,

00:01:20.000 --> 99:59:59.000
or here's the key message we need to deliver.
