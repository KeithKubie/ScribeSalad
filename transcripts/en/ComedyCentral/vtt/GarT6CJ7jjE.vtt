  - Yeah, I know a
  PA on Transparent,

00:00:02.401 --> 00:00:04.237
so I think I know what
trans people go through.

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:05.471 line:0%
- Stop.

00:00:05.504 --> 00:00:06.973
 You've participated
 in a trolling cliche.

00:00:07.006 --> 00:00:08.775
 The hall pass.

00:00:08.808 --> 00:00:09.976
 What's that?

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:11.844 align:start size:88% position:13%
Your cousin's wife's
uncle fought in Vietnam?

00:00:11.877 --> 00:00:13.312
 Wow.

00:00:13.345 --> 00:00:15.281 align:start position:0%
You must be the world's leading
authority on the history

00:00:15.314 --> 00:00:17.617
of communism in Southeast Asia.

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:18.751
You know, using your alignments

00:00:18.784 --> 00:00:20.420
to make your point doesn't work.

00:00:20.453 --> 00:00:22.755 align:start position:0%
This whole, "I can't be racist,
my best friend is black,"

00:00:22.788 --> 00:00:25.258
 stuff has been going
 on for a long time.

00:00:25.291 --> 00:00:28.027 size:88% position:44%
  But thank you for updating
  it and bringing it online.

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:30.863
 It's just a shame it's never
 worked, and it never will.

00:00:30.896 --> 00:00:33.099 align:start size:88% position:13%
But I'm sure you know
all about never working.

00:00:33.132 --> 00:00:37.303
 'Cause you once talked to a
 homeless dude at a bus stop.
