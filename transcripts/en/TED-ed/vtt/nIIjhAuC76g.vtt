00:00:11.597 --> 00:00:15.464
Hercules, son of Zeus 
and champion of humankind,

00:00:15.464 --> 00:00:17.876
gazed in horror as he realized

00:00:17.876 --> 00:00:22.677
he had just committed 
the most unspeakable crime imaginable.

00:00:22.677 --> 00:00:28.179
The goddess Hera, who hated Hercules 
for being born of her husband’s adultery,

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:32.210
had stricken him 
with a temporary curse of madness.

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:35.220
And his own family were the casualties.

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:39.866
Consumed by grief, Hercules sought out 
the Oracle of Delphi,

00:00:39.866 --> 00:00:43.957
who told him the path to atonement lay
with his cousin,

00:00:43.957 --> 00:00:48.675
King Eurystheus of Tiryns, 
a favorite of Hera’s.

00:00:48.675 --> 00:00:53.891
Eurystheus hoped to humiliate Hercules 
with ten impossible tasks

00:00:53.891 --> 00:00:56.686
that pitted him against 
invincible monsters

00:00:56.686 --> 00:00:59.863
and unfathomable forces.

00:00:59.863 --> 00:01:04.061
Instead, the king set the stage 
for an epic series of adventures

00:01:04.061 --> 00:01:08.927
that would come to be known 
as the Labors of Hercules.

00:01:08.927 --> 00:01:12.881
The first labor was 
to slay the Nemean Lion,

00:01:12.881 --> 00:01:16.497
who kidnapped women 
and devoured warriors.

00:01:16.497 --> 00:01:20.666
Its golden fur was impervious to arrows,

00:01:20.666 --> 00:01:23.998
but Hercules cornered 
the lion in its dark cave,

00:01:23.998 --> 00:01:26.123
stunned it with a club,

00:01:26.123 --> 00:01:28.762
and strangled it with his bare hands.

00:01:28.762 --> 00:01:32.451
He found no tool sharp enough 
to skin the beast,

00:01:32.451 --> 00:01:38.429
until the goddess Athena suggested 
using one of its own claws.

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:42.237
Hercules returned to Tiryns 
wearing the lion’s hide,

00:01:42.237 --> 00:01:48.058
frightening King Eurystheus so much 
that he hid in a wine jar.

00:01:48.058 --> 00:01:50.126
From then on, Hercules was ordered

00:01:50.126 --> 00:01:53.923
to present his trophies 
at a safe distance.

00:01:53.923 --> 00:02:00.116
The second target was the Lernaean Hydra,
a giant serpent with many heads.

00:02:00.116 --> 00:02:01.996
Hercules fought fiercely,

00:02:01.996 --> 00:02:06.630
but every time he cut one head off,
two more grew in its place.

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.312
The battle was hopeless

00:02:08.312 --> 00:02:12.993
until his nephew Iolaus thought 
to cauterize the necks with fire,

00:02:12.993 --> 00:02:15.975
keeping the heads from regrowing.

00:02:15.975 --> 00:02:20.389
The dead serpent’s remains 
became the Hydra constellation.

00:02:20.389 --> 00:02:26.357
Instead of slaying a beast, 
Hercules next had to catch one, alive.

00:02:26.357 --> 00:02:31.966
The Ceryneian Hind was a female deer 
so fast it could outrun an arrow.

00:02:31.966 --> 00:02:34.171
Hercules tracked it for a year,

00:02:34.171 --> 00:02:39.039
finally trapping it in the northern land 
of Hyperborea.

00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:43.020
The animal turned out to be sacred 
to Artemis, goddess of the hunt,

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.657
and Hercules swore to return it.

00:02:45.657 --> 00:02:49.823
When Eurystheus saw the hind, 
he demanded to keep it instead,

00:02:49.823 --> 00:02:53.996
but as soon as Hercules let go,
the animal ran to its mistress.

00:02:53.996 --> 00:02:59.889
Thus, Hercules completed his task 
without breaking his promise.

00:02:59.889 --> 00:03:03.645
The fourth mission was to capture 
the Erymanthian boar,

00:03:03.645 --> 00:03:06.140
which had ravaged many fields.

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:09.966
Advised by the wise centaur Chiron,

00:03:09.966 --> 00:03:13.722
Hercules trapped it 
by chasing it into thick snow.

00:03:13.722 --> 00:03:18.653
For the fifth task, there were no animals,
just their leftovers.

00:03:18.653 --> 00:03:23.424
The stables where King Augeas 
kept his hundreds of divine cattle

00:03:23.424 --> 00:03:25.792
had not been maintained in ages.

00:03:25.792 --> 00:03:29.300
Hercules promised to clean them in one day

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:32.500
if he could keep one-tenth 
of the livestock.

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:35.136
Augeas expected the hero to fail.

00:03:35.136 --> 00:03:38.242
Instead, Hercules dug massive trenches,

00:03:38.242 --> 00:03:42.376
rerouting two nearby rivers to flow 
through the stables

00:03:42.376 --> 00:03:44.783
until they were spotless.

00:03:44.783 --> 00:03:47.746
Next came three more beastly foes,

00:03:47.746 --> 00:03:51.028
each requiring 
a clever strategy to defeat.

00:03:51.028 --> 00:03:57.331
The carnivorous Stymphalian birds 
nested in an impenetrable swamp,

00:03:57.331 --> 00:04:01.536
but Hercules used Athena’s special rattle 
to frighten them into the air,

00:04:01.536 --> 00:04:04.408
at which point he shot them down.

00:04:04.408 --> 00:04:08.644
No mortal could stand before 
the Cretan bull’s mad rampage,

00:04:08.644 --> 00:04:12.871
but a chokehold 
from behind did the trick.

00:04:12.871 --> 00:04:15.171
And the mad King Diomedes,

00:04:15.171 --> 00:04:18.576
who had trained his horses 
to devour his guests,

00:04:18.576 --> 00:04:20.560
got a taste of his own medicine

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:24.063
when Hercules wrestled him 
into his own stables.

00:04:24.063 --> 00:04:31.117
The ensuing feast calmed the beasts 
enough for Hercules to bind their mouths.

00:04:31.117 --> 00:04:36.056
But the ninth labor involved someone 
more dangerous than any beast,

00:04:36.056 --> 00:04:39.096
Hippolyta, Queen of the Amazons.

00:04:39.096 --> 00:04:46.488
Hercules was to retrieve the belt given
to her by her father Ares, the god of war.

00:04:46.488 --> 00:04:51.342
He sailed to the Amazon land of Themyscira
prepared for battle,

00:04:51.342 --> 00:04:55.156
but the queen was so impressed 
with the hero and his exploits

00:04:55.156 --> 00:04:58.175
that she gave the belt willingly.

00:04:58.175 --> 00:05:00.080
For his tenth labor,

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:05.148
Hercules had to steal a herd 
of magical red cattle from Geryon,

00:05:05.148 --> 00:05:08.635
a giant with three heads and three bodies.

00:05:08.635 --> 00:05:12.899
On his way, Hercules was so annoyed 
by the Libyan desert heat

00:05:12.899 --> 00:05:15.076
that he shot an arrow at the Sun.

00:05:15.076 --> 00:05:19.319
The sun god Helios admired 
the hero’s strength

00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:24.582
and lent his chariot for the journey 
to the island of Erytheia.

00:05:24.582 --> 00:05:27.716
There, Hercules fought off 
Geryon’s herdsman

00:05:27.716 --> 00:05:32.559
and his two-headed dog, 
before killing the giant himself.

00:05:32.559 --> 00:05:34.179
That should have been the end.

00:05:34.179 --> 00:05:37.582
But Eurystheus announced 
that two labors hadn’t counted:

00:05:37.582 --> 00:05:41.187
the Hydra, because Iolaus 
had helped Hercules kill it,

00:05:41.187 --> 00:05:44.965
and the stables, 
because he’d accepted payment.

00:05:44.965 --> 00:05:48.756
And so, the hero set 
about his eleventh task,

00:05:48.756 --> 00:05:53.800
obtaining golden apples from 
the garden of the Hesperides nymphs.

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:57.634
Hercules began by catching 
the Old Man of the Sea

00:05:57.634 --> 00:06:03.244
and holding the shape-shifting water-god
until he revealed the garden’s location.

00:06:03.244 --> 00:06:08.496
Once there, the hero found the titan Atlas
holding up the heavens.

00:06:08.496 --> 00:06:13.502
Hercules offered to take his place 
if Atlas would retrieve the apples.

00:06:13.502 --> 00:06:18.670
Atlas eagerly complied, but Hercules then
tricked him into trading places again,

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:22.386
escaping with apples in hand.

00:06:22.386 --> 00:06:27.402
The twelfth and final task 
was to bring back Cerberus,

00:06:27.402 --> 00:06:30.926
the three-headed hound 
guarding the underworld.

00:06:30.926 --> 00:06:36.952
Helped by Hermes and Athena, 
Hercules descended and met Hades himself.

00:06:36.952 --> 00:06:40.353
The lord of the dead allowed Hercules 
to take the beast

00:06:40.353 --> 00:06:42.298
if he could do it without weapons,

00:06:42.298 --> 00:06:46.650
which he achieved by grabbing 
all three of its heads at once.

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:50.405
When he presented the hound 
to a horrified Eurystheus,

00:06:50.405 --> 00:06:54.573
the king finally declared 
the hero’s service complete.

00:06:54.573 --> 00:06:57.707
After 12 years of toil,

00:06:57.707 --> 00:07:01.157
Hercules had redeemed the tragic deaths 
of his family

00:07:01.157 --> 00:07:04.128
and earned a place in the divine pantheon.

00:07:04.128 --> 00:07:07.735
But his victory held 
an even deeper importance.

00:07:07.735 --> 00:07:11.963
In overcoming the chaotic 
and monstrous forces of the world,

00:07:11.963 --> 00:07:17.343
the hero swept away what remained 
of the Titans’ primordial order,

00:07:17.343 --> 00:07:21.301
reshaping it into one 
where humanity could thrive.

00:07:21.301 --> 00:07:22.730
Through his labors,

00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:28.418
Hercules tamed the world’s madness 
by atoning for his own.
