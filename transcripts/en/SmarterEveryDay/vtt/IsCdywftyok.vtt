00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:05.010
Hey it's me Destin, welcome back to Smarter Every Day.

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:08.040
So it might surprise you to know that we have hockey at the

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:12.060
university that I went to. Anyway today we're gonna talk about the physics of a slap shot.

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:16.100
You're getting Smarter Every Day.

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:20.160
[theme music] [crowd noise]

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:24.190
(Destin) No way, you're missing a tooth?

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.230
That's so stereotypical hockey player. Can I see it?

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:32.270
What did you, when'd you get your tooth knocked out?
- 3 years ago.
- 3 what?
- 3 and a half years ago.

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:36.290
- That's awesome dude. Is it like a right of passage that you have to lose a

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:40.290
tooth in order to play hockey?
- No I mean.. ah..

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:44.340
- Just the good players?
- Just the good ones.
- [laughs] Alright so here's what we're gonna do today. We're gonna hit the puck

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.370
and record it with a Phantom which I have setup over there, and we're gonna see

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.400
exactly what's happening. I've heard that you don't actually hit the puck first, but I

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:56.490
want to look at the dynamics of how that happens. But first, let's look at your stick here. What kind of stick

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:00.510
is it, is it a wooden stick?
- No it's a one piece composite.
- Yep

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:04.540
- Made out of graphite. So mine's an 85 flex. I like mine a little whippier.

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:08.560
- Whippier is 85.. I love that word. Can you say that as much as possible

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.640
during this interview?
- Yeah I can say it. A little more whip to it. You can get a stiffer one

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:16.700
for the bigger guys.
[hits puck]

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.740
(Destin) I don't understand how you can hit that hard. That's crazy, I respect goalies

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:24.780
a lot more now. OK let's get the Phantom. Hoo I've fallen! [laughs]

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:29.830
(Destin) Alright bring it.

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.840
[hits puck]

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.360
 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:40.900
[hits ice]

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.970
[hits puck]

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:49.020
 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:53.980
[hits ice]

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.080
[hits puck]

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.480
 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:05.150
OK, so we got the close-up shot. Now what we're gonna do is we're gonna transition to a wide shot. We're gonna keep the Phantom at

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:09.180
3,200 frames per second but the goal here, the data we're looking for is we're gonna

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.230
try to pre-load that stick and get the entire flex, or the deformation of the stick

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.280
while he goes in for the slap shot. The slap shot is the fastest shot in hockey.

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.310
So what's the advantage of having a flexible stick?

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.350
Let's check out the high speed. The player stores potential energy in the stick

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:29.390
by striking the ice before he hits the puck. Now this seems like it would

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:33.400
waste energy and slow down his shot but it actually does the opposite.

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.430
By gradually releasing that potential energy

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.460
stored up in the stick like a slingshot, the player can make the puck go even

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:45.480
faster than he can swing the stick. Look at the overflex here as the

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.510
stick outruns the player's hands.

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:56.180
 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:57.610
[hits puck]

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:02.430
 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:05.650
This means that a good slap shot is all about timing.

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:09.670
And not just the timing about where you're gonna hit the ice, but also knowing how long

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:13.680
it takes that stored up energy to whip out of your stick.

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.730
So to understand the flexibility of a hockey stick we're here with my friend Dr Jeff Evans

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:21.750
We are friends, correct? Can I say that?
- We are friends.
- We are friends. I once tried to convince him to

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:25.760
shoot a coyote in his pasture cause I thought.. no, it wasn't a coyote.
- We thought

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:29.800
it was.. he thought it was a coyote. It was a donkey.
- It was a.. [laugh] It was a donkey.

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:33.810
You break things right?
- We do. We break things by pushing, pulling, twisting,

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:37.830
fatigue, we wear them out, we break them.
- OK some bonus footage.

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:41.900
We're going to crush a hockey puck here.

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:45.920
Check it out. 80,000lbs

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:49.990
on a hockey puck. One interesting thing I discovered while doing this is hockey players often

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:54.060
have no idea what the flex number on their stick means. If you support a stick

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:58.110
on both sides here and you hang weights right on the center, that flex number that's on

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:02.140
every single hockey stick is an indication for how much weight it takes to deflect

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:06.160
a hockey stick one inch. The problem is, often manufacturers don't do it correctly

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:10.210
so we have all these sticks from different manufacturers and Dr Evans is gonna take

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:14.250
the data as I apply weight to the stick and we're gonna measure the actual flex number

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:18.290
against the claimed flex number. We hung calibrated weights from four different

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:22.340
sticks, each with a different flex number. Then we recorded the deflection

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:26.360
values for each stick and generated a curve representing its stiffness.

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:30.380
The flex falue is the weight in pounds required to deflect the stick one inch.

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:34.410
The numbers we measured however were much lower than the manufacturer's numbers but this

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:38.430
is probably because the sticks were used and they lost their stiffness over time.

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:42.440
Check it out though. Real science. Let's take a closer look though.

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:46.490
A beam deflection equation can be used to model a hockey stick's flex. This force

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:50.510
represents the pivot hand and this force represents the stick hitting the ice.

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:54.560
The maximum displacement happens right here in the middle where the player's hand pushes

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:58.600
on the stick. In engineering we use two types of diagrams called shear and moment diagrams

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:02.640
to understand the stresses on the inside of a beam. So if our hockey player

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:06.700
is strong enough to actually break a stick while doing a slap shot,

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:10.750
according to science, where exactly along the stick is it going to break?

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:14.770
[hits puck]

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:18.800
- Did you get it?
(Destin) So where do you think it broke relative

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:22.830
to where your hand was?
- Probably in it.

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:26.860
- Like you think it was in your hand when it broke?
- Yeah. Oh yeah.

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:28.900
- Alright let's make sure I got it on slow mo.

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:34.600
 

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:35.360
[hits ice]

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:39.910
[scrapes ice]

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:41.980
[hits puck]

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.030
Did you see that?

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:47.090
There are two types of loading that added up to break the stick. First he flexed

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:51.120
it on the ice, but it wasn't until he tried to actually accelerate the puck

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:55.150
that it kicked it up over its maximum stress limit and actually broke the stick.

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:59.150
That is awesome. So thanks for sticking with me as I try to

00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:03.210

Before... and after.
- It was a smashing good time.
- [laughs]

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:43.540
You want more whippyness, or more stiffyness?

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:47.580
- Oh, ah all in, all in.. All in preference.
- [laugh]

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:51.590
- It's for science. I need a new stick.
