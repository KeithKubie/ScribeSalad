00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.180
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: Good
evening and welcome.

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:17.630
I'm Anne McLean from the
library's music division.

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:20.780
We are very excited tonight
to present the world premiere

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:23.740
of a new work by Brett
Dean, Rooms of Elsinore.

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:26.170
And it's wonderful to have
the composer here with us.

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:27.470
Welcome.

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:28.880
&gt;&gt; Brett Dean: Thank
you very much, Anne.

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.100
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: And you've come
from Berlin for this week here

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:35.120
at the library and our pianist,
Juho Pohjonen has come on a run

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.100
out from Finland, I believe.

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:38.400
&gt;&gt; Juho Pohjonen: Yes.

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:39.700
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: That's great.

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:41.000
And this is your first
time at the library.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.120
You said I think that the
Santa Fe festival had helped

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:44.420
to introduce you?

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:45.720
This is new?

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:47.020
&gt;&gt; Brett Dean: That's right.

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:51.670
I mean I think we have
Marc Neikrug much to thank

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:56.270
for us coming together and for
this commission coming about.

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:58.400
And so Juho was a guest

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.950
of the festival last
year for the first time.

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:02.700
&gt;&gt; Steven Ovitsky: Yes,
just this past summer.

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:08.040
And Marc and I were talking and
for the last couple of years,

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.720
working with Anne
and the library,

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.600
we've been planning this
commission and this concert.

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.160
So, the premiere is tonight
and then we'll play it again

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.200
in Santa Fe with
both of you in July.

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.580
&gt;&gt; Brett Dean: Yeah,
that's right.

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.620
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: So, let
me step back a moment.

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:26.630
I didn't get to introducing
my colleague, Steve Ovitsky,

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.900
from the Santa Fe
festival and we are pleased

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.310
that you have brought with
you a number of friends

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:33.610
of the festival tonight.

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:36.840
&gt;&gt; Steven Ovitsky: We have about
25 board members and spouses,

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.440
partners, supporters, who
are here from everywhere.

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:44.820
I mean many of them live
in Santa Fe year round.

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.420
We have a couple here from
Savannah, one from San Francisco

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.140
who just came in for this.

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.840
So, our board and our supporters
are all over the country

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.540
because we exist in only a
six-week festival during the

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.470
summer and so they come in for
the music and we're delighted

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:04.960
that so many of them came along
to hear this concert tonight.

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:06.260
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: And I know

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:07.560
that commissioning has always
been an important thing

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.450
for Santa Fe, just as it is,
of course, for the library,

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:12.190
but you presented-- commissioned

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:14.550
and presented the string
quartet we'll hear tonight,

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.650
String Quartet #2, And
Once I Played Ophelia.

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:18.950
We're looking forward to that.

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.300
And Tony Arnold is
just an amazing singer.

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:22.740
&gt;&gt; Brett Dean: Absolutely
astonishing.

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:24.040
Yeah.

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:25.340
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: So,
when was this?

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:26.640
A couple years ago?

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:27.940
&gt;&gt; Steven Ovitsky:
Twenty-fourteen.

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:29.240
&gt;&gt; Brett Dean: Twenty-fourteen.

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:30.540
&gt;&gt; Steven Ovitsky: Yeah, in '14.

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.200
The piece tonight-- what
Brett didn't mention is

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.310
that not only did he compose
it, but he's playing it tonight

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:43.590
as well and-- but in 2014 we
commissioned the string quartet

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:50.130
that you'll hear with soprano
and we also commissioned--

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:52.450
we've done a number--
over the last seven year--

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:58.430
six or seven years, Brett came
to us once as a violist and we--

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:00.290
then the next year we
commissioned a piece,

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:01.590
I think a string quintet?

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.160
&gt;&gt; Brett Dean: Well, I've
always had my viola with me.

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.180
&gt;&gt; Steven Ovitsky: Yeah, I know.

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:07.180
&gt;&gt; Brett Dean: And the
previous commission was the

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:08.480
string quintet.

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:09.780
&gt;&gt; Steven Ovitsky: The quintet.

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.600
So, this is the third piece
we've commissioned from Brett

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:16.420
and that's pretty close to
a record for the festival.

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:21.070
We've commissioned about 75
pieces over the last 42 years

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:24.800
and we do about two
or three a year

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:29.810
and you are probably the most
commissioned composer right now.

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:31.110
&gt;&gt; Brett Dean: I
feel very honored.

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:35.170
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: You know, for us
it's exciting to have you here

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:37.570
because you join a
very distinguished line

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:40.790
of composer performers
who have performed here

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:44.810
and one was Paul
Hindemith in 1937,

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:49.070
also playing his own viola
music, and of course many other

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:51.430
like Copeland and
Bernstein and so on.

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:54.770
So, as a conductor,
composer, and violist,

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:57.160
we're looking forward to
sort of chatting for a moment

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:59.700
about the whole picture
of the state

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.380
of the art of the viola today.

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:04.200
You have the big
perspective on everything.

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.220
But before we get to
that, I wanted to ask you

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:07.520
about some of the manuscripts.

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:10.470
I know that you and Juho had
a moment yesterday to look

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:12.860
at some manuscripts,
including the mansion builder,

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:14.780
which you can see in
the cases tonight.

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:18.220
This is a fairly recent
acquisition by the library

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:21.220
and I understand you made
a discovery of something.

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:22.520
&gt;&gt; Brett Dean: Well,
yeah, I mean there was a--

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:24.840
there's a spot in
the third movement

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.970
that has always struck
me as slightly odd

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:32.500
where the piano has this
beautifully rhapsodic moment

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:35.390
in the trio section

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:39.970
of an otherwise fairly
tumultuous scherzo movement.

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:43.880
And the viola just has these
sort of pizzicato notes

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:46.240
that go up the A string.

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:49.200
And I was keen to
look at that very spot

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:53.560
and sure enough there's an
extra note in the original

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:56.570
that we're going to
put back in tonight.

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:57.920
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: Tonight?

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:59.220
&gt;&gt; Brett Dean: Yes.

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:00.520
It's a first.

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:01.820
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: This is
a-- this is exciting.

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:03.260
I'm glad we're getting
you on video.

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:04.820
Anything that you noticed, Juho?

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:06.280
&gt;&gt; Juho Pohjonen: Well, I
noticed in the first movement

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:09.350
that there was a-- one spot
that actually had bothered me

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:12.940
for a long time because there's
a transition to the B section

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:17.990
from the A section which happens
very abruptly and I discovered

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:20.630
in the manuscripts that
he had a longer transition

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:25.940
for like 16 bars worth of
music which he removed.

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:27.620
So, that's why it
feels very sudden.

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:28.920
&gt;&gt; Brett Dean: Yeah, and then

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:31.970
when you know what his
original train of thought was,

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:34.330
then somehow the suddenness

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:37.740
of the transition makes complete
sense because you see, no,

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:39.740
he went down that
path and realized, no,

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:42.290
that's not what I mean.

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:43.590
Yeah.

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:44.890
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: So, you never
know what you'll discover here.

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:48.500
I remember once George Schulte
came to look at some manuscripts

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:51.550
and he went out with a big smile
on his face and somebody ran

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:53.880
after him in the hall and said,
maestro, what did you find out,

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:56.400
and he-- he said, oh, I found
something no one has ever

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:57.700
seen before.

00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:59.800
He didn't say what it
was, it was either, but--

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:02.500
&gt;&gt; Steven Ovitsky: In the
manuscript-- so, is the--

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:06.210
is that transition then
crossed out in the manuscript?

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:07.510
&gt;&gt; Brett Dean: Completely
crossed out.

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:10.550
In fact, never fully
worked through anyway,

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:12.550
but he just then crossed it out.

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:16.190
Yeah. And I mean I also found
it fascinating discovery

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:19.110
in the Schonberg quartet, which
I'm not playing in tonight,

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:21.480
but have played on
previous occasions.

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:24.510
And the famous line
in the last movement,

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:29.110
which is also famously the
first sort of free atonal piece

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:31.510
that Schonberg ever
wrote and to the words

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:34.050
[ Foreign Language Spoken ]

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:36.570
I feel the air of other planets.

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:41.180
He shortened that transition
as well by a whole bar,

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:43.890
such that the impact
of the chord

00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:48.650
in the quartet is followed
much more immediately

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:53.440
than in the final version
where you've seen him scribble

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:56.720
out a bar by the
soprano coming in.

00:06:56.720 --> 00:07:00.500
And so he realized then
also that it needed to--

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:02.560
the shock of that
moment needed to,

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:04.440
you know, result more quickly.

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:05.740
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: I didn't know

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:07.040
that you had seen
that one yesterday.

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:09.440
Well, you know, as long as we're
talking about this, let's shift

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:12.470
and go talking about the
Schonberg we were thinking

00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:16.190
of talking later, but Steve,
you have talked about this too,

00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:19.310
how lush the piece is and
I know that it's a work

00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:21.060
that as you say had a
very personal meaning

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:22.430
for Schoenberg himself.

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:26.720
And what for me was so
striking was this contextual

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:30.390
juxtaposition of the Stefan
George expressivist poetry

00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:33.160
that you're quoting and
then the strange quote

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:36.410
of the [foreign phrase],
you know, in there.

00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:39.020
But you were talking about the
harmonic aspects of the work.

00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:42.460
&gt;&gt; Steven Ovitsky: I was just
saying that when I talk to some

00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:46.590
of our board people who
are mostly non-musicians,

00:07:46.590 --> 00:07:49.130
but deeply in love
with chamber music.

00:07:49.130 --> 00:07:51.350
And sometimes when they
see the name Schoenberg,

00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:53.770
they get a little--
they still after 100

00:07:53.770 --> 00:07:57.370
and some years get
a bit frightened.

00:07:57.370 --> 00:08:01.250
A few years ago, we did
a remarkable performance

00:08:01.250 --> 00:08:03.340
of [foreign phrase]
with the arions

00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:06.560
as the main-- the
quartet in that.

00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:08.850
And it brought the house down.

00:08:08.850 --> 00:08:11.740
Everyone just really loved it

00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:13.530
and I was telling
our board people

00:08:13.530 --> 00:08:18.350
at dinner the other night how
this quartet number two is

00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:20.270
in that same cut.

00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:24.540
It's that same very
ultra-romantic style.

00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:27.330
It's just before
the atonal style.

00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:31.870
And how passionate a piece it
is, especially since everything

00:08:31.870 --> 00:08:37.570
that was going on in his life
that helped him or that--

00:08:37.570 --> 00:08:41.110
didn't help, but sort of moved
him to write this quartet.

00:08:41.110 --> 00:08:45.130
It was a very difficult time
in his life when he wrote this

00:08:45.130 --> 00:08:50.650
and that they should sort
of relax, forget the name,

00:08:50.650 --> 00:08:55.000
forget what they think
they know about Schoenberg,

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:56.960
and listen to it as
a late romantic piece

00:08:56.960 --> 00:09:00.190
and then it makes sense to them.

00:09:00.190 --> 00:09:03.280
&gt;&gt; Brett Dean: And, if I
may, it then makes sense

00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:07.090
of how the atonal thing
evolved because you then see it

00:09:07.090 --> 00:09:09.680
in the context of these
three previous movements

00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:11.970
that are getting more
and more extreme,

00:09:11.970 --> 00:09:16.340
including as you say this
sort of bizarre, you know,

00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:18.960
folk tune in the middle of it.

00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:22.270
And then you see that the
lift off of the last movement

00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:26.770
into a completely, you
know, tonal free world--

00:09:26.770 --> 00:09:28.980
although it's still quite
tonal in the end still

00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:30.630
in F sharp minor as well, but--

00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:34.690
oh, F sharp major then,
but it makes sense.

00:09:34.690 --> 00:09:38.080
You see that he could
only go that path.

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:40.910
&gt;&gt; Steven Ovitsky: The one thing
about this program tonight is

00:09:40.910 --> 00:09:46.160
that rarely do you hear a
string quartet with soprano.

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:48.140
Tonight there are two of them

00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:51.290
and the two best
ones that I know of.

00:09:51.290 --> 00:09:53.040
I don't-- are there any others?

00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:54.340
&gt;&gt; Brett Dean: There
are several.

00:09:54.340 --> 00:09:56.100
Yeah. Yeah.

00:09:56.100 --> 00:09:57.720
I'm sorry?

00:09:57.720 --> 00:10:00.040
[ Inaudible Speaker ]

00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:02.760
I think but piano as well.

00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:04.060
The--

00:10:04.060 --> 00:10:05.360
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: Dover Beach?

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:08.220
&gt;&gt; Brett Dean: Dover Beach, I
think it has piano-- and piano.

00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:09.520
&gt;&gt; Steven Ovitsky: Baritone.

00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:10.820
Yeah.

00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:12.120
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: This
is a beautiful program.

00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:14.910
I mean it fits together
so well and has such--

00:10:14.910 --> 00:10:17.040
so many threads running
through it.

00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:18.880
Before-- and I want
to talk to you

00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:20.850
about your Shakespeare universe

00:10:20.850 --> 00:10:23.360
that you've been
inhabiting for quite a while.

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:25.440
Before we leave the
Schoenberg, I wanted to say

00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:28.800
that our colleague found a very
interesting photograph that's

00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:31.260
on display out here, which
I didn't even know we had.

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:34.500
Apparently George Gershwin
was a big fan of Schoenberg.

00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:35.940
I did not know that.

00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:37.240
And this was a photograph

00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:39.360
that he arranged to
have commissioned.

00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:41.640
It's very, of course,
austere, you know,

00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:43.090
Schoenberg, what he looked like.

00:10:43.090 --> 00:10:44.770
&gt;&gt; Brett Dean: Yeah, he
never smiled I don't think.

00:10:44.770 --> 00:10:46.070
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: Yeah, yeah.

00:10:46.070 --> 00:10:51.340
And on the-- apparently Gershwin
liked the quartets very much

00:10:51.340 --> 00:10:54.050
and he subscribed to
their publication and then

00:10:54.050 --> 00:10:58.780
on this photograph you'll see he
has transcribed a few tiny bits

00:10:58.780 --> 00:11:02.630
of music from both the first
quartet and the fourth quartet.

00:11:02.630 --> 00:11:03.930
So, it's just a bit of--

00:11:03.930 --> 00:11:06.120
you just never know what
you're going to run across here

00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:08.490
and it's fun to unearth
these things.

00:11:08.490 --> 00:11:13.370
But we have so much to ask you
about about this new piece,

00:11:13.370 --> 00:11:16.500
Rooms of Elsinore, and
also about the fact

00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:19.420
that you have been really as
I say inhabiting this world.

00:11:19.420 --> 00:11:22.440
How did you become so
involved with the work

00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:24.410
of Shakespeare's Hamlet?

00:11:24.410 --> 00:11:29.040
Well, about seven years
ago, after the premiere

00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:32.660
of my first opera, which was
based on an Australian novel

00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:35.950
by Peter Carey called
Bliss, it was performed,

00:11:35.950 --> 00:11:39.750
among other places, firstly in
Australia, then also in Hamburg

00:11:39.750 --> 00:11:43.440
and the Hamburg production
was seen by the--

00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:46.600
at the time the managing
director of Glyndebourne Opera

00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:53.550
in the U.K. who then approached
me to write a second opera.

00:11:53.550 --> 00:11:55.090
So, I mean I must say one

00:11:55.090 --> 00:12:00.850
of the trickiest things
is really setting upon

00:12:00.850 --> 00:12:06.670
and being happy with a
choice for an opera story.

00:12:06.670 --> 00:12:09.760
Because it's something
you're going to live

00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:12.560
with for quite a few years
of one's life and so you want

00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:15.780
to make sure you've
made the right decision.

00:12:15.780 --> 00:12:20.050
And so, after quite a bit of
deliberation and a fair bit

00:12:20.050 --> 00:12:26.160
of daunting at the Shakespeare
factor, I decided to dive right

00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:30.590
in and write not only a
Shakespeare opera, but Hamlet.

00:12:30.590 --> 00:12:35.120
And I'm thrilled also
tonight that my librettist,

00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:38.200
Matthew Jocelyn, is
here from Toronto.

00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:43.170
Because he's been very much,
you know, my partner in crime

00:12:43.170 --> 00:12:49.240
through this journey and it's
been an extraordinary thing

00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:52.880
to delve into every single
word, not only of Hamlet

00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:54.810
as we know it, but all
the different versions.

00:12:54.810 --> 00:12:59.370
I mean Matthew brought into
play the early first quarto

00:12:59.370 --> 00:13:03.760
and the differences between
the other versions as well

00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:09.610
and so we've nutted out
our own version of Hamlet

00:13:09.610 --> 00:13:12.460
over these past years
and the journey started

00:13:12.460 --> 00:13:14.720
with the string quartet
that we'll hear tonight.

00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:16.220
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: Yeah,
I had wondered--

00:13:16.220 --> 00:13:20.190
and I saw that you had--
you and Matthew had sat

00:13:20.190 --> 00:13:23.060
down to read the entire
quarto in five hours

00:13:23.060 --> 00:13:26.120
or something yourselves
to really hear every word.

00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:29.860
I was fascinated to see on the
video that you talked about this

00:13:29.860 --> 00:13:34.060
about just examining the
fragments and the phrases

00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:36.380
and so forth and I
know that this piece--

00:13:36.380 --> 00:13:38.270
tell us about the
string quartet.

00:13:38.270 --> 00:13:42.670
You used words from other
people besides Ophelia.

00:13:42.670 --> 00:13:47.980
&gt;&gt; Brett Dean: Well, Matthew's
idea then for this libretto,

00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:51.060
in which we knew right from
the start we had one soprano,

00:13:51.060 --> 00:13:56.440
it was obvious that we were then
going to examine one or other

00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:57.750
of the female characters.

00:13:57.750 --> 00:14:00.540
In a sense, we examined
both Ophelia and Gertrude,

00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:03.920
but specifically Ophelia,
but not only her words,

00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:07.180
but also words that are
said to her or about her or,

00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:11.700
for example, Hamlet's love
poem that he writes to her.

00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:16.470
In this way, we were able
to focus on various aspects

00:14:16.470 --> 00:14:20.040
of this one person, but also
then start exploring other

00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:25.230
characters as well and see
a kind of micro version

00:14:25.230 --> 00:14:27.160
of the whole play
through the prism

00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:30.140
of this one extraordinary
character.

00:14:30.140 --> 00:14:32.120
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: Well, it's in
June, right, at Glyndebourne?

00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:34.450
&gt;&gt; Brett Dean: It premieres in
just a couple of months, yeah.

00:14:34.450 --> 00:14:36.420
It's all very exciting.

00:14:36.420 --> 00:14:38.560
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: And we were
touched, really, to see--

00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:41.600
to read about this, given that
our piece with the name Rooms

00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:47.620
of Elsinore is about Hamlet's
potential or purported castle

00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:50.900
and to realize that this brings
you to a sort of a full circle

00:14:50.900 --> 00:14:54.680
of your passionate
endeavor to explore this.

00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:58.310
Did you actually go to the
Kronborg castle I understand?

00:14:58.310 --> 00:14:59.610
&gt;&gt; Brett Dean: Yeah.

00:14:59.610 --> 00:15:03.850
In the midst-- fairly early
on in the journey, my wife,

00:15:03.850 --> 00:15:06.210
Heather, who is also
here tonight,

00:15:06.210 --> 00:15:10.020
she and I then paid a
visit to the Kronborg,

00:15:10.020 --> 00:15:12.940
north of Copenhagen
on the strait

00:15:12.940 --> 00:15:15.930
between Denmark and Sweden.

00:15:15.930 --> 00:15:19.340
And whilst I know
that the director

00:15:19.340 --> 00:15:21.090
of the Glyndebourne production,

00:15:21.090 --> 00:15:24.200
the Australian director Neil
Armfield, isn't planning

00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:29.150
on it being a period costume
drama, it was still fascinating

00:15:29.150 --> 00:15:32.780
to walk through this space,
also accompanied by the thought

00:15:32.780 --> 00:15:36.840
that we never-- you never know,
he may have been there himself

00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:38.150
as a traveling player.

00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:42.800
There were lots of
performances there at the time.

00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:48.170
And just to get a feel for
how the unfolding of the play

00:15:48.170 --> 00:15:50.900
in a physical space
could have happened.

00:15:50.900 --> 00:15:56.100
And so, you know, in a way
this piece, Rooms of Elsinore,

00:15:56.100 --> 00:15:58.000
is a kind of guided tour

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:03.040
of where the action takes place
following through the dark gate

00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:06.230
of the beginning into
the king's chamber,

00:16:06.230 --> 00:16:08.890
the chapel, the queen's chamber.

00:16:08.890 --> 00:16:13.370
And it was also a nice
and I think fitting way

00:16:13.370 --> 00:16:17.860
of closing the book on an
almost four-year journey

00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:19.160
through Hamlet.

00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:22.070
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: Amazing that
it has been four years for you.

00:16:22.070 --> 00:16:27.290
Do you feel-- do you feel
that you-- well, let me say--

00:16:27.290 --> 00:16:28.810
take a step back on that.

00:16:28.810 --> 00:16:31.910
I notice you talk about
literature as a huge influence

00:16:31.910 --> 00:16:34.250
and you've talked
about a sense of place.

00:16:34.250 --> 00:16:37.680
Would you mind saying what the
programmatic titles of the--

00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:39.990
something about the
spaces and so on?

00:16:39.990 --> 00:16:42.830
Because I found them-- listening
to your rehearsal work,

00:16:42.830 --> 00:16:46.040
I found them very evocative and
very different from each other,

00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:48.930
even though I didn't know the
program per se, I didn't think

00:16:48.930 --> 00:16:51.180
about them, but, yeah, they
were-- they were fascinating.

00:16:51.180 --> 00:16:53.060
And also then could
we talk a little

00:16:53.060 --> 00:16:55.160
about the role of the piano too?

00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:56.460
The piano writing.

00:16:56.460 --> 00:16:57.760
&gt;&gt; Brett Dean: Yeah,
well, that will be for you

00:16:57.760 --> 00:16:59.080
to say a few words
about, not-- I'll--

00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:01.300
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: Since
he plays, yeah.

00:17:01.300 --> 00:17:04.080
&gt;&gt; Brett Dean: Well, I mean,
having taken quite a few photos

00:17:04.080 --> 00:17:06.610
from the Kronborg
when we visited

00:17:06.610 --> 00:17:08.600
and having them also placed

00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:15.200
on my studio wall alongside
a long sort of storyboard

00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:21.050
in shaping this opera, I
also had the tourist map

00:17:21.050 --> 00:17:26.100
of the castle with, you know,
the numbered sort of highlights

00:17:26.100 --> 00:17:27.770
of where you go through.

00:17:27.770 --> 00:17:32.450
And so that's somehow what
brought about this idea

00:17:32.450 --> 00:17:37.780
of the suite of seven movements
which open with the dark gate

00:17:37.780 --> 00:17:40.650
and proceeds then
without a break

00:17:40.650 --> 00:17:43.390
into the foregate courtyard.

00:17:43.390 --> 00:17:48.640
The dark gates and the courtyard
and the following movement,

00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:52.570
the platform, all relate
to material that I've used

00:17:52.570 --> 00:17:56.400
in the opera that is the
moment where the ghost appears.

00:17:56.400 --> 00:18:00.370
First of all, in the
original play, Horatio

00:18:00.370 --> 00:18:03.150
and Marcellus see the ghost
and tell Hamlet about it later

00:18:03.150 --> 00:18:07.280
and then, bam, he sees
the ghost himself,

00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:10.350
which sets the whole
drama in motion.

00:18:10.350 --> 00:18:13.370
We then proceed to
the fourth movement,

00:18:13.370 --> 00:18:17.860
a long and very busy dramatic
movement called the king's

00:18:17.860 --> 00:18:21.440
chamber, where obviously
so much of all that goes on

00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:25.180
and all the intrigue in
the play takes place.

00:18:25.180 --> 00:18:27.980
We then proceed to the chapel,

00:18:27.980 --> 00:18:32.270
the place where Hamlet
chances upon Claudius

00:18:32.270 --> 00:18:34.470
and actually sees an
opportunity to kill him

00:18:34.470 --> 00:18:39.900
when Claudius is confessing
to the murder of King Hamlet.

00:18:39.900 --> 00:18:43.420
Hamlet sneaks up behind
him, but then realizes

00:18:43.420 --> 00:18:46.400
that seeing the king is
confessing his sin in church

00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:49.050
to kill him there would
send him to heaven

00:18:49.050 --> 00:18:51.290
and he doesn't want that.

00:18:51.290 --> 00:18:53.770
He then proceeds from the
chapel to the queen's chamber

00:18:53.770 --> 00:18:56.380
to confront his mother
about all that's going on,

00:18:56.380 --> 00:18:59.790
having just witnessed the
play and being convinced

00:18:59.790 --> 00:19:04.160
that what the ghost originally
told him must be true.

00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:06.940
So, then the queen's
chamber is the other sort

00:19:06.940 --> 00:19:13.230
of longish movement
which conjures this drama

00:19:13.230 --> 00:19:15.830
of the ghost's reappearance

00:19:15.830 --> 00:19:20.800
where hamlet sees the
ghost, but Gertrude doesn't.

00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:26.440
Then, to close this particular,
you know, scene-setting piece

00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:29.070
of seven movements,
I've proceeded then

00:19:29.070 --> 00:19:33.540
to the trumpeter's tower, which
isn't a moment from the opera,

00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:37.060
but gives us a kind of
birds-eye view of the whole--

00:19:37.060 --> 00:19:39.470
you know, it's surveying
the area

00:19:39.470 --> 00:19:41.860
in which the whole
play has taken place.

00:19:41.860 --> 00:19:44.120
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: This is
great because on the video

00:19:44.120 --> 00:19:47.230
that we'll be connected to
tonight's perform-- we will--

00:19:47.230 --> 00:19:48.560
we will put this together

00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:51.510
and that way people will have a
chance to really hear what was

00:19:51.510 --> 00:19:53.760
in your mind as you
worked through this

00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:58.220
and I'd wondered too if your
wife's paintings had-- were--

00:19:58.220 --> 00:20:01.880
have they been in this
storyline at any point?

00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:04.050
I know you're influenced
by the lot of them.

00:20:04.050 --> 00:20:05.500
&gt;&gt; Brett Dean: Very much
right from the start.

00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:07.690
While I was still
humming and hawing

00:20:07.690 --> 00:20:11.070
about whether I could possibly
take on Hamlet, Heather picked

00:20:11.070 --> 00:20:14.850
up the ball and ran with it and
started a cycle of paintings,

00:20:14.850 --> 00:20:16.980
which is also still ongoing

00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:21.140
and she'll also be doing
two exhibitions in the U.K.

00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:22.730
at the same time
as the production.

00:20:22.730 --> 00:20:28.090
One in Glyndebourne itself
on the walls of the theater

00:20:28.090 --> 00:20:29.390
and the other in London.

00:20:29.390 --> 00:20:34.870
So, very-- I mean it's a--
it's a creative relationship

00:20:34.870 --> 00:20:36.650
between us that is, you know,

00:20:36.650 --> 00:20:39.850
charged by what the
other is up to, really.

00:20:39.850 --> 00:20:41.150
Yeah.

00:20:41.150 --> 00:20:42.450
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: That's
wonderful.

00:20:42.450 --> 00:20:44.160
And so let's talk about
your relationship here too.

00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:46.710
I was fascinated to see you
put this together this week

00:20:46.710 --> 00:20:49.630
and having found out that you
didn't know each other before,

00:20:49.630 --> 00:20:51.830
what has that been like
where you're totally new

00:20:51.830 --> 00:20:53.130
to each other and so on?

00:20:53.130 --> 00:20:54.880
&gt;&gt; Brett Dean: We're
having a great time, but--

00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:56.180
&gt;&gt; Juho Pohjonen: Likewise.

00:20:56.180 --> 00:20:57.480
&gt;&gt; Brett Dean: You can say.

00:20:57.480 --> 00:20:58.780
&gt;&gt; Juho Pohjonen:
Well, I mean-- the--

00:20:58.780 --> 00:21:01.910
I got the music about
a month ago, which is--

00:21:01.910 --> 00:21:04.800
I mean it sounds pretty short
time to put together something,

00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:07.680
but actually it's a lot of time.

00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:11.440
And we went through a few
revisions of the score

00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:13.290
and we made some changes.

00:21:13.290 --> 00:21:14.890
Even today you made
some changes.

00:21:14.890 --> 00:21:16.190
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: Really?

00:21:16.190 --> 00:21:17.490
Oh, wow.

00:21:17.490 --> 00:21:18.790
&gt;&gt; Juho Pohjonen: Of
course, first thing is

00:21:18.790 --> 00:21:21.710
to just practice separately
the different parts

00:21:21.710 --> 00:21:27.510
and then we met together two
days ago, three days ago?

00:21:27.510 --> 00:21:28.810
Two days ago?

00:21:28.810 --> 00:21:30.110
&gt;&gt; Brett Dean: Well,
what's today?

00:21:30.110 --> 00:21:32.290
Saturday? We'd met--
we started on Thursday.

00:21:32.290 --> 00:21:33.960
&gt;&gt; Juho Pohjonen: Right.

00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:35.910
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: And I'm so
glad you've almost had a mini

00:21:35.910 --> 00:21:40.140
residency this week, in a way,
and thanks to David Pylar,

00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:42.910
my colleague who had
shown you those treasures,

00:21:42.910 --> 00:21:44.940
it's a way of sort
of introducing you

00:21:44.940 --> 00:21:47.430
to the larger picture
of the library

00:21:47.430 --> 00:21:50.050
and you got a mini
tour and so on.

00:21:50.050 --> 00:21:51.770
But often artists come in

00:21:51.770 --> 00:21:53.410
and we don't have the
time to spend with them.

00:21:53.410 --> 00:21:58.470
So, it's pretty exciting
for us about this.

00:21:58.470 --> 00:22:02.580
About the writing for the
work the Rooms of Elsinore,

00:22:02.580 --> 00:22:05.230
I was going to ask you about--

00:22:05.230 --> 00:22:07.690
we can talk a little bit about
the viola too and then I want

00:22:07.690 --> 00:22:11.920
to get back to sort of new
music as a final topic.

00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:15.190
But about the writing for
this one, you've mentioned

00:22:15.190 --> 00:22:18.730
that you thought this
viola, the Tuscan Medici,

00:22:18.730 --> 00:22:24.450
was especially perhaps a good
match because of its finesse,

00:22:24.450 --> 00:22:26.940
the variety of things,
and this fast response.

00:22:26.940 --> 00:22:29.900
I remember you said those
words, fast response,

00:22:29.900 --> 00:22:32.650
and then I noticed there are
a lot of textures and so on.

00:22:32.650 --> 00:22:34.770
And in your score you
say the word whisper

00:22:34.770 --> 00:22:36.070
at one point I think.

00:22:36.070 --> 00:22:37.370
Some things like that.

00:22:37.370 --> 00:22:39.360
Did you find that this viola
helped you to express some

00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:41.210
of those things that
you had in your mind?

00:22:41.210 --> 00:22:42.890
&gt;&gt; Brett Dean: Well, I
mean a great instrument--

00:22:42.890 --> 00:22:46.930
is a great instrument because
it can give you so much

00:22:46.930 --> 00:22:49.850
because it has such a
wide palette of colors

00:22:49.850 --> 00:22:54.500
and the tricky thing is
getting to know an instrument

00:22:54.500 --> 00:22:58.410
of that quality in such
a short time, but--

00:22:58.410 --> 00:23:01.630
and originally I was actually
thinking I'd play the shoe man

00:23:01.630 --> 00:23:05.390
on the Stradivarius and my
piece on my own instrument,

00:23:05.390 --> 00:23:09.910
but it was just so immediate
the relationship we struck

00:23:09.910 --> 00:23:15.880
up that I thought, no, I mean,
get a chance to play on a Strad

00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:20.740
of that quality, no, I
wouldn't mind one, really, but,

00:23:20.740 --> 00:23:23.560
yeah, it's very special.

00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:25.810
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: Well,
this one, as many people

00:23:25.810 --> 00:23:28.600
in the audience tonight will
know, is on loan to the library.

00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:30.940
It's a special one made in 1690.

00:23:30.940 --> 00:23:35.760
It's very powerful and has
a great, deep register.

00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:37.060
It really sings.

00:23:37.060 --> 00:23:38.360
It speaks.

00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:41.060
You know? And I wanted to
talk about that a little bit.

00:23:41.060 --> 00:23:43.790
Before we leave your
piece, Juho,

00:23:43.790 --> 00:23:46.140
any comments on the
piano writing?

00:23:46.140 --> 00:23:47.580
&gt;&gt; Juho Pohjonen:
The piano writing.

00:23:47.580 --> 00:23:52.520
I just play the music
and hope for the best.

00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:53.870
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: Oh, my goodness.

00:23:53.870 --> 00:23:57.220
&gt;&gt; Juho Pohjonen: What I
appreciate about your writing is

00:23:57.220 --> 00:24:01.630
that the piano and viola, they
are pretty much equal in terms

00:24:01.630 --> 00:24:03.940
of the importance, so there's
lots of things happening

00:24:03.940 --> 00:24:06.420
on the piano and
also in the viola.

00:24:06.420 --> 00:24:09.860
And, of course, because of
the different characteristics

00:24:09.860 --> 00:24:13.450
of the instruments, the
viola has more melody

00:24:13.450 --> 00:24:17.700
because that's what string
players can play only one line

00:24:17.700 --> 00:24:23.990
and piano has more texture and
the texture is kind of something

00:24:23.990 --> 00:24:27.120
that creates color
and atmosphere.

00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:34.480
So, in a way, I have plenty of
things to do and have affect on.

00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:37.600
&gt;&gt; Brett Dean: He's in charge
of the spooky bits, really.

00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:39.600
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: There are some
spooky bit-- there really are--

00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:43.430
and you'll be-- it'll be great
to have a recording of this too.

00:24:43.430 --> 00:24:46.320
There's ethereal
wisps here and there.

00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:48.800
Yeah, and I can see, you know,
things floating in the air

00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:51.740
above the ramparts and
things like that maybe.

00:24:51.740 --> 00:24:54.360
I liked your piece--

00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:57.670
this comment about this piece
having a dramaturgy of its own.

00:24:57.670 --> 00:25:00.960
So, it's programmatic, but
you don't need the program

00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:02.930
to hear it and understand it.

00:25:02.930 --> 00:25:04.750
&gt;&gt; Brett Dean: Yeah, I'm
always fascinated by, you know,

00:25:04.750 --> 00:25:07.800
how music comes across,
particularly new music,

00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:11.600
if you don't know
anything about it.

00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:14.310
You know, you sort of
turn on the radio and come

00:25:14.310 --> 00:25:16.530
in to the middle of a piece
and what does that say to you.

00:25:16.530 --> 00:25:20.770
And I do always hope
that the piece of music--

00:25:20.770 --> 00:25:22.910
although, most of my
pieces have some sort of--

00:25:22.910 --> 00:25:26.740
not necessarily program, but
extramusical aspect or component

00:25:26.740 --> 00:25:30.190
to them, I like to think that
they will also make sense

00:25:30.190 --> 00:25:34.170
on purely musical abstract
terms, if you like.

00:25:34.170 --> 00:25:37.280
And so, you know,
I'd like to think

00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:44.840
that the piece has its own
charge and fascination aside

00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:47.400
from the titles of
the movements.

00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:48.700
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: Which
it certainly does

00:25:48.700 --> 00:25:51.260
and you will enjoy
this piece very much.

00:25:51.260 --> 00:25:54.270
Well, as segueing into just
new music, since that is

00:25:54.270 --> 00:25:57.410
such a strong aspect at Santa
Fe and both here, what--

00:25:57.410 --> 00:26:00.960
do you see any sort of--

00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:04.350
not resurgence, but I feel
there's a lot more new music

00:26:04.350 --> 00:26:06.540
being written for the viola
these days that's just

00:26:06.540 --> 00:26:07.950
really excellent.

00:26:07.950 --> 00:26:10.240
What is your perspective
on that?

00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:13.080
It used to be sort of a
poor stepchild in a way.

00:26:13.080 --> 00:26:16.480
&gt;&gt; Brett Dean: Well, because
the-- I mean violas are--

00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:19.920
we're the slow ones, and so
we've been slow on the uptake

00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:21.810
at developing our own repertoire

00:26:21.810 --> 00:26:25.240
or at least composers
have neglected the viola

00:26:25.240 --> 00:26:27.340
for such a long time
that it's now coming

00:26:27.340 --> 00:26:29.290
into its own in many ways.

00:26:29.290 --> 00:26:31.910
I mean in the later
sort of 20th century

00:26:31.910 --> 00:26:36.560
and into the 21st century
it's really being recognized

00:26:36.560 --> 00:26:38.420
for its own-- on its own terms.

00:26:38.420 --> 00:26:40.080
It's not a violin.

00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:41.380
It's not a cello.

00:26:41.380 --> 00:26:44.300
It's very much its own thing and
has a very distinctive color.

00:26:44.300 --> 00:26:46.930
And I mean it's also through
the commissioning process

00:26:46.930 --> 00:26:51.860
of festivals such as yours,
Steve, that has sort of brought

00:26:51.860 --> 00:26:54.170
about a lot of these
opportunities also,

00:26:54.170 --> 00:26:56.510
the double viola quintet
of mine, just to speak

00:26:56.510 --> 00:26:59.460
of my own things, but also no
doubt many other things as well.

00:26:59.460 --> 00:27:04.830
And so, you know, it is-- it
is finding its repertoire.

00:27:04.830 --> 00:27:06.740
And we don't have the
kind of, you know,

00:27:06.740 --> 00:27:11.890
the legacy of umpteen Mozart or
Beethoven sonatas to fall back

00:27:11.890 --> 00:27:15.690
on and so it's still--
it's still happening now.

00:27:15.690 --> 00:27:16.990
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: I think so.

00:27:16.990 --> 00:27:18.430
Do you have-- have you had
any new pieces that are--

00:27:18.430 --> 00:27:21.220
you'd like to mention that have
come along for you in this--

00:27:21.220 --> 00:27:23.640
&gt;&gt; Steven Ovitsky: Well,
this summer, festival goes

00:27:23.640 --> 00:27:27.470
between the 16th of July and
the 21st of August and during

00:27:27.470 --> 00:27:29.670
that time we have
about 45 concerts

00:27:29.670 --> 00:27:31.960
in just under six weeks.

00:27:31.960 --> 00:27:35.400
Some weeks-- it's almost
like your schedule here,

00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:39.350
but some weeks we have as many
as seven concerts in a week

00:27:39.350 --> 00:27:44.560
and about 80 to 100 musicians
usually come to the festival.

00:27:44.560 --> 00:27:47.380
And this summer we
have three new pieces,

00:27:47.380 --> 00:27:50.000
the one you'll be hearing
tonight that we co-commissioned

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:53.310
with Anne and the
Library of Congress.

00:27:53.310 --> 00:27:57.770
A piece for a piano
solo by Julian Anderson

00:27:57.770 --> 00:28:00.730
that was co-commissioned
with the Aldeburgh Festival,

00:28:00.730 --> 00:28:04.290
and a piece by Bill
Balkum [assumed spelling].

00:28:04.290 --> 00:28:07.260
William Balkum, a sextet
for mixed wind, strings,

00:28:07.260 --> 00:28:10.960
and piano that we
co-commissioned

00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:13.940
with Chamber Music
Northwest in Portland.

00:28:13.940 --> 00:28:15.840
And that's-- that should be--

00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:17.820
I'm really looking forward
to hearing that one as well

00:28:17.820 --> 00:28:21.950
because a few years ago
we were talking with Bill

00:28:21.950 --> 00:28:23.280
and with David Shifrin,

00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:26.150
the clarinetist who's
the artistic director

00:28:26.150 --> 00:28:31.470
of Chamber Music Northwest, and
we were talking about what kind

00:28:31.470 --> 00:28:33.210
of interesting, you know,

00:28:33.210 --> 00:28:35.600
interesting orchestration
could we do.

00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:39.670
And we had just played
Martinu's Revue de Cuisine,

00:28:39.670 --> 00:28:45.610
which is like violin,
cello, trumpet, bassoon,

00:28:45.610 --> 00:28:48.310
piano, and I think clarinet.

00:28:48.310 --> 00:28:51.370
But-- and Bill said
that's a great combination.

00:28:51.370 --> 00:28:55.360
So, he wanted to do that
and then, unfortunately,

00:28:55.360 --> 00:29:00.970
after we had planned the season,
he said what would happen

00:29:00.970 --> 00:29:02.330
if I changed the orchestration

00:29:02.330 --> 00:29:05.030
to the same orchestration
as Walton's Facade?

00:29:05.030 --> 00:29:06.330
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: Oh, my goodness.

00:29:06.330 --> 00:29:08.550
&gt;&gt; Steven Ovitsky: And
we were already locked in

00:29:08.550 --> 00:29:11.760
and we couldn't do it and
the more I think about it--

00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:14.150
I love the orchestration
of Facade

00:29:14.150 --> 00:29:15.820
and it would be a great piece,

00:29:15.820 --> 00:29:18.170
so maybe that will be
another time with Bill

00:29:18.170 --> 00:29:22.920
because he loves writing
pieces that are very agreeable

00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:26.150
to the audiences and
also have such cleverness

00:29:26.150 --> 00:29:28.180
in the orchestration
and the composition.

00:29:28.180 --> 00:29:31.020
So, those are three
new pieces this summer.

00:29:31.020 --> 00:29:34.880
And we have commissions
for summer of 18 and summer

00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:38.630
of 19 we're working on
now, so we're always doing

00:29:38.630 --> 00:29:41.210
about three new works
every summer.

00:29:41.210 --> 00:29:42.510
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: Wonderful.

00:29:42.510 --> 00:29:43.810
&gt;&gt; Steven Ovitsky: Yeah,
both co-commissions

00:29:43.810 --> 00:29:46.040
and single commissions.

00:29:46.040 --> 00:29:49.190
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: And, Juho,
do you do a lot of new music

00:29:49.190 --> 00:29:52.600
or is your performing
career mostly--

00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:54.850
&gt;&gt; Juho Pohjonen: I do
every kind of music, but I--

00:29:54.850 --> 00:29:56.150
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: Wonderful, yeah.

00:29:56.150 --> 00:29:57.450
&gt;&gt; Juho Pohjonen:
I'll play very--

00:29:57.450 --> 00:30:00.940
in a short time is Esa-Pekka
Salonen's piano concerto,

00:30:00.940 --> 00:30:02.280
which is very--

00:30:02.280 --> 00:30:05.040
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: I'm
a Salonen fan, yeah.

00:30:05.040 --> 00:30:06.340
Fantastic.

00:30:06.340 --> 00:30:07.640
&gt;&gt; Juho Pohjonen: Very
interesting music, too.

00:30:07.640 --> 00:30:09.380
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: And what's the
recording project you mentioned

00:30:09.380 --> 00:30:10.680
that you're going back to?

00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:14.070
&gt;&gt; Juho Pohjonen: Oh,
that's old music, Bach.

00:30:14.070 --> 00:30:15.370
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: That's
a nice mixture.

00:30:15.370 --> 00:30:18.220
&gt;&gt; Brett Dean: Timeless.

00:30:18.220 --> 00:30:19.600
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: So,
one of the things

00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:21.380
that while you were talking,
Steve, I was thinking

00:30:21.380 --> 00:30:24.700
about Kim Kashkashian's
comment that she felt music--

00:30:24.700 --> 00:30:28.340
new music for the viola was
more supported in Europe

00:30:28.340 --> 00:30:30.240
and I said why would you--

00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:32.610
why do you say that and she said
she thought there were still

00:30:32.610 --> 00:30:35.210
government subsidy enough
for orchestras there

00:30:35.210 --> 00:30:39.270
that you found the odd concerto
coming through because of that.

00:30:39.270 --> 00:30:41.290
And you of course have
an orchestra background

00:30:41.290 --> 00:30:43.540
and I hadn't thought of
that being a strong element

00:30:43.540 --> 00:30:48.130
and why there might be more
viola pieces for orchestra now.

00:30:48.130 --> 00:30:51.740
And you'd conduct your
own work a great deal.

00:30:51.740 --> 00:30:55.000
You have more than one concerto?

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:58.040
&gt;&gt; Brett Dean: Well, I've
written myself a viola concerto.

00:30:58.040 --> 00:31:03.140
I've got other concertos, but,
yeah, the viola concerto format

00:31:03.140 --> 00:31:06.290
or genre is something that
I think has led the charge

00:31:06.290 --> 00:31:10.210
of new repertoire
for the viola and--

00:31:10.210 --> 00:31:12.450
I mean it's a tricky--
it's a tricky beast.

00:31:12.450 --> 00:31:16.860
The viola-- in saying that
it's certainly not the violin

00:31:16.860 --> 00:31:20.910
or the cello, it also sits
very much in the middle

00:31:20.910 --> 00:31:25.060
of an orchestral range and so
scoring for it is something,

00:31:25.060 --> 00:31:28.200
you know, in a concerto
setting is something you've got

00:31:28.200 --> 00:31:29.950
to be a bit careful about.

00:31:29.950 --> 00:31:33.160
I know I've had to rewrite
my own concerto a few times

00:31:33.160 --> 00:31:34.900
because I couldn't be heard.

00:31:34.900 --> 00:31:38.250
So, you know, you live
and learn, really.

00:31:38.250 --> 00:31:40.680
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: Well,
I know that we--

00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:44.550
I think we need to give you
a chance to warm up on stage,

00:31:44.550 --> 00:31:47.380
so do we-- I would love
to talk more and, in fact,

00:31:47.380 --> 00:31:49.370
we'll have to have
offline conversations

00:31:49.370 --> 00:31:52.050
about have you seen the
Benedict Cumberbatch Hamlet

00:31:52.050 --> 00:31:54.270
and have you seen the
David Tennant Hamlet

00:31:54.270 --> 00:31:55.960
and a few other things
like that.

00:31:55.960 --> 00:31:57.770
But we want to give
the audience a chance.

00:31:57.770 --> 00:32:01.570
So, does anyone have a question
for our colleagues here?

00:32:01.570 --> 00:32:02.870
&gt;&gt; One second.

00:32:02.870 --> 00:32:05.170
One second.

00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:10.700
&gt;&gt; It's on?

00:32:10.700 --> 00:32:13.970
OK. Actually, Anne,
this is additional.

00:32:13.970 --> 00:32:15.930
I walked in when you made
the comments on Gershwin

00:32:15.930 --> 00:32:18.230
and Schoenberg and I wanted
to add something to that

00:32:18.230 --> 00:32:20.790
because I understand not
only did Gershwin subscribe

00:32:20.790 --> 00:32:22.900
to the publication of
the Schoenberg quartets,

00:32:22.900 --> 00:32:25.690
he helped finance recordings
of them in the 1930's

00:32:25.690 --> 00:32:29.310
by the Kolisch Quartet, which I
think can still be found on CD

00:32:29.310 --> 00:32:32.170
in the secondary market.

00:32:32.170 --> 00:32:36.130
And they played tennis together
in Los Angeles regularly.

00:32:36.130 --> 00:32:37.430
There's a clip of them playing--

00:32:37.430 --> 00:32:38.730
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: Tennis,
you said?

00:32:38.730 --> 00:32:40.840
&gt;&gt; Yes. Yes, they enjoyed
playing tennis with each other.

00:32:40.840 --> 00:32:43.200
There's a clip that can be seen
on YouTube of them doing this.

00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:44.500
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: Oh, my goodness.

00:32:44.500 --> 00:32:47.310
&gt;&gt; And not only did Gershwin
greatly respect Schoenberg,

00:32:47.310 --> 00:32:48.640
but it went the other way too.

00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:51.280
Schoenberg had great respect
for Gershwin as a composer.

00:32:51.280 --> 00:32:54.460
When Gershwin died in 1937,
there was a memorial book put

00:32:54.460 --> 00:32:56.920
out of reminiscences
and Schoenberg's is one

00:32:56.920 --> 00:32:59.240
of the most touching in
the whole collection.

00:32:59.240 --> 00:33:01.250
And I believe there's
even a recording

00:33:01.250 --> 00:33:03.820
of him reading a section
of it also on YouTube.

00:33:03.820 --> 00:33:07.770
So, we draw this hard line
sometimes between tonal

00:33:07.770 --> 00:33:09.100
and serial twelve tone music.

00:33:09.100 --> 00:33:14.040
It-- the-- sometimes they're
a lot closer than we--

00:33:14.040 --> 00:33:15.780
&gt;&gt; Brett Dean: And
some poses don't see it

00:33:15.780 --> 00:33:19.260
as a hard line and-- which
brings me back to my comment

00:33:19.260 --> 00:33:21.450
about the second quartet.

00:33:21.450 --> 00:33:23.640
It's not a hard line,
it's actually--

00:33:23.640 --> 00:33:26.230
it floats from one end to the
other and I think that's what's

00:33:26.230 --> 00:33:30.280
so remarkable about
that piece too.

00:33:30.280 --> 00:33:31.580
&gt;&gt; That's it.

00:33:31.580 --> 00:33:32.880
Thanks.

00:33:32.880 --> 00:33:34.180
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: Yeah,
interesting.

00:33:34.180 --> 00:33:35.480
Anyone else?

00:33:35.480 --> 00:33:38.830
I think-- so, I think
we're in good shape.

00:33:38.830 --> 00:33:42.120
Brett is going to give our viola
a little bit of a warm up here

00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:45.950
and thank you very, very
much, Brett, Juho, Steve.

00:33:45.950 --> 00:33:47.250
&gt;&gt; Brett Dean: Thank you.

00:33:47.250 --> 00:33:49.050
It's been a pleasure.

00:33:49.050 --> 00:33:53.460
