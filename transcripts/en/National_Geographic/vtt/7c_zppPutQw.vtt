Stephanie: Child marriage occurs

00:00:53.486 --> 00:00:55.555 line:0%
in more than 50 developing
countries around the world.

00:00:55.555 --> 00:00:57.790 line:0%
And almost always results

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:59.525 line:0%
in the girl's
removal from school.

00:00:59.525 --> 00:01:01.460
What families don't realize

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:03.963
is that by curtailing
girl's education,

00:01:03.963 --> 00:01:06.666
they're only perpetuating
the cycle of poverty.

00:01:06.666 --> 00:01:10.370
Still, families do this
for a number of reasons.

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:11.871
Perhaps they can't afford
to feed

00:01:11.871 --> 00:01:13.505
the rest of their children.

00:01:13.505 --> 00:01:15.474
It can create family alliances

00:01:15.474 --> 00:01:17.176
and it often settles debts.

00:01:17.176 --> 00:01:20.813
Early marriage often
results in abusive

00:01:20.813 --> 00:01:23.650
and even deadly consequences.

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:30.290
( bells ringing )

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.663 line:0%
I first ran into this issue
in Afghanistan in 2003.

00:01:37.663 --> 00:01:40.232
I was doing a story
on the burn ward

00:01:40.232 --> 00:01:43.202
in Herat, Afghanistan.

00:01:43.202 --> 00:01:46.873
There several girls had
set themselves on fire

00:01:46.873 --> 00:01:51.009
and I didn't understand
why they would do that.

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:52.244
As a Westerner, as someone who

00:01:52.244 --> 00:01:55.114
just hadn't had anything
personal in my life

00:01:55.114 --> 00:01:57.283
that was so bad that
I would want to do that,

00:01:57.283 --> 00:02:00.019
and then I met this
young girl, Marzia.

00:02:00.019 --> 00:02:02.755
She was 15 years
old and turned out,

00:02:02.755 --> 00:02:06.392
she had been married
at the age of nine.

00:02:06.392 --> 00:02:08.528
She had set herself on fire

00:02:08.528 --> 00:02:12.565
because she broke her
husband's television set

00:02:12.565 --> 00:02:15.935
and obviously was so
fearful of reaction

00:02:15.935 --> 00:02:17.703
by him or the family

00:02:17.703 --> 00:02:20.406
that she decided to
set herself on fire,

00:02:20.406 --> 00:02:23.208
and really that's
a suicide attempt.

00:02:23.208 --> 00:02:25.211
While I was in the burn ward,

00:02:25.211 --> 00:02:28.214
I met several girls who...
They all gave different reasons

00:02:28.214 --> 00:02:29.915
for why they would do this.

00:02:29.915 --> 00:02:32.217
Like someone didn't
make the tea hot enough.

00:02:32.217 --> 00:02:34.653
It wasn't reasons that
I could comprehend.

00:02:34.653 --> 00:02:37.890
The more I researched
about their lives,

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:39.525
I learned that more
than half of those girls

00:02:39.525 --> 00:02:40.759
were married underage.

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:42.695
Now, I don't believe
that's the only reason

00:02:42.695 --> 00:02:44.230
why those girls did that

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:45.764
but at the same time,

00:02:45.764 --> 00:02:47.933
it was a common denominator
I couldn't deny.

00:02:47.933 --> 00:02:50.036
I wanted to look at the issues

00:02:50.036 --> 00:02:52.071
that would lead to
such a horrific act.

00:02:52.071 --> 00:02:54.373
I felt it was a bit
irresponsible actually

00:02:54.373 --> 00:02:55.741
as a photojournalist,

00:02:55.741 --> 00:02:57.276
the journalist part
being important,

00:02:57.276 --> 00:02:59.044
to just show this end result.

00:02:59.044 --> 00:03:01.313
I started looking at the issue
of underage marriage,

00:03:01.313 --> 00:03:03.649
something I had never
encountered before like this.

00:03:03.649 --> 00:03:08.521
I had the great fortune
to meet Malalai Kakar

00:03:08.521 --> 00:03:11.290
and she was a police
officer in Kandahar.

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:14.827
Just a powerhouse,
really amazing woman.

00:03:14.827 --> 00:03:16.829
She had been working with...

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:18.898
in the police department
for more than 20 years,

00:03:18.898 --> 00:03:20.933
even under the Taliban,

00:03:20.933 --> 00:03:23.035
only working on women's issues.

00:03:23.035 --> 00:03:25.904
I told her what I was
working on and she said,

00:03:25.904 --> 00:03:27.873
"Stephanie, this is impossible.

00:03:27.873 --> 00:03:29.041
You're never going to

00:03:29.041 --> 00:03:31.009
photograph a wedding
here in Afghanistan."

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:32.578
She's like, "I don't even know

00:03:32.578 --> 00:03:35.281
if I can even get you
anything like this."

00:03:35.281 --> 00:03:36.949
She's like,
"It happens all the time

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:39.484
but I don't know if I can get
you this," and I said "okay."

00:03:39.484 --> 00:03:41.187
Then I went back to the hotel

00:03:41.187 --> 00:03:42.421
and she called me
that afternoon.

00:03:42.421 --> 00:03:44.756
She's like, "Stephanie,
get over here."

00:03:44.756 --> 00:03:46.792
She had this young girl Jamila,

00:03:46.792 --> 00:03:48.461
which actually means
beautiful in Arabic,

00:03:48.461 --> 00:03:51.630
but this young girl Jamila,
she was 15 years old.

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:53.833
She had been stabbed
by her husband.

00:03:53.833 --> 00:03:55.468
This is her husband there.

00:03:55.468 --> 00:03:56.836
She already had 2 kids

00:03:56.836 --> 00:03:58.604
and she had just been
trying to visit her mother

00:03:58.604 --> 00:04:00.073
without his permission.

00:04:00.073 --> 00:04:01.741
I asked Malalai,

00:04:01.741 --> 00:04:03.042
I said, "What's going
to happen to this man?"

00:04:03.042 --> 00:04:04.410
And she said, "Nothing."

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:05.611
She kind of scoffed

00:04:05.611 --> 00:04:07.012
and then that's when she said,

00:04:07.012 --> 00:04:08.347
"Men are kings here."

00:04:08.347 --> 00:04:10.616
Unfortunately she was the one

00:04:10.616 --> 00:04:13.953
who was later murdered
by the Taliban.

00:04:13.953 --> 00:04:17.056
Having worked in the Middle
East for a long time,

00:04:17.056 --> 00:04:19.025
I really wanted to make
sure this wasn't something

00:04:19.025 --> 00:04:22.261
that was just against
one religious practice.

00:04:22.261 --> 00:04:24.897
It's not meant to be
against any religion,
religious practice,

00:04:24.897 --> 00:04:27.099
but I didn't want
to single out one,

00:04:27.099 --> 00:04:29.902
and so, I went looking
in different countries

00:04:29.902 --> 00:04:31.437
and cultures as well.

00:04:31.437 --> 00:04:34.841
This series of
photographs is from Nepal.

00:04:34.841 --> 00:04:37.310
And this is a village
called the Kagati Village

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:40.579
and it's just only
30 minutes outside of Kathmandu.

00:04:40.579 --> 00:04:44.183
This village is known
for practicing this.
There is a day...

00:04:44.183 --> 00:04:45.951
It's not Akha Teej,
which they do in India,

00:04:45.951 --> 00:04:47.453
but it's a different
auspicious day

00:04:47.453 --> 00:04:49.822
where a lot of girls are
married on the same day.

00:04:49.822 --> 00:04:52.625
I was able to see several
of these young marriages.

00:04:52.625 --> 00:04:57.463
The girls are usually
married between 13 and 16.

00:04:57.463 --> 00:04:59.731
It was very difficult
to get access to.

00:04:59.731 --> 00:05:01.067
In a lot of cases I showed them

00:05:01.067 --> 00:05:03.769
some of the other pictures
that I had done before

00:05:03.769 --> 00:05:07.206
and I wanted them
to know that I wasn't ...

00:05:07.206 --> 00:05:09.308
You know, even though...
I mean, I was focusing,

00:05:09.308 --> 00:05:11.210
specifically in the beginning
of the project,

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:13.845
on kind of
the harmful repercussions

00:05:13.845 --> 00:05:17.216
because I wanted that
message to get out,

00:05:17.216 --> 00:05:19.384
but at the same time

00:05:19.384 --> 00:05:21.788
I wanted to show
the cultures of the weddings

00:05:21.788 --> 00:05:23.288
and the beauty in
these cultures,

00:05:23.288 --> 00:05:24.723
and that was one of the reasons

00:05:24.723 --> 00:05:26.825
why I actually wanted to show
the weddings themselves

00:05:26.825 --> 00:05:29.562
because you see all
these beautiful colors.

00:05:29.562 --> 00:05:32.164
There are some really
beautiful traditions.

00:05:32.164 --> 00:05:33.699
One thing that I learned

00:05:33.699 --> 00:05:36.202
was that some of the people
in these weddings

00:05:36.202 --> 00:05:37.536
that were participating,

00:05:37.536 --> 00:05:39.071
were actually
against the practice

00:05:39.071 --> 00:05:41.173
but they were
walking a fine line

00:05:41.173 --> 00:05:44.210
between trying to like speak out

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:46.712
but also they were
part of the culture.

00:05:46.712 --> 00:05:49.181
They wanted to help me out

00:05:49.181 --> 00:05:50.783
and help be their voice.

00:05:50.783 --> 00:05:53.886
I also went to Ethiopia

00:05:53.886 --> 00:05:56.955
where they have a strong
Christian population.

00:05:56.955 --> 00:05:59.358
In January there's
a lot of weddings

00:05:59.358 --> 00:06:01.294
up in the Amhara District,

00:06:01.294 --> 00:06:04.096
which is where it's most
predominant in Ethiopia.

00:06:04.096 --> 00:06:06.866
I went to several weddings there

00:06:06.866 --> 00:06:09.301
and this one was
of a young girl.

00:06:09.301 --> 00:06:11.671
I think she was 14, Layulim.

00:06:11.671 --> 00:06:15.208
Here they actually drape
the sheet over her head

00:06:15.208 --> 00:06:18.010
to take her to her
husband's house.

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:19.345
That's when they
were taking her.

00:06:19.345 --> 00:06:21.680
Actually she was
one of the girls

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:23.882
who didn't mind that
she was getting married.

00:06:23.882 --> 00:06:25.817
She thought she was
gonna have a better life.

00:06:25.817 --> 00:06:27.553
She wasn't against her marriage

00:06:27.553 --> 00:06:29.388
but they were taking
her to the house

00:06:29.388 --> 00:06:30.990
and I asked why is she
covered up like that?

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:33.659
She said, "Well, we
just wanna make sure

00:06:33.659 --> 00:06:36.228
that if she escapes,
she can't find her way home,

00:06:36.228 --> 00:06:38.130
so she'll have to come back."

00:06:39.131 --> 00:06:41.967
This is the first time that
I actually was involved

00:06:41.967 --> 00:06:43.869
in the stopping of a wedding.

00:06:43.869 --> 00:06:45.637
In this situation,
the mother came over

00:06:45.637 --> 00:06:47.340
and she said to my translator

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:49.308
that this girl was gonna
get married that week.

00:06:49.308 --> 00:06:51.777
She asked us if we could
stop it and I said,

00:06:51.777 --> 00:06:53.445
"I really don't know."

00:06:53.445 --> 00:06:55.047
That's not my job to do that,

00:06:55.047 --> 00:06:56.682
it's not my position
as a foreigner.

00:06:56.682 --> 00:06:58.918
Not even as a journalist
but as a foreigner

00:06:58.918 --> 00:07:02.121
and I said, "But, if you want
to discuss it with the sheikh...

00:07:02.121 --> 00:07:04.056
And we have our
government minder as well.

00:07:04.056 --> 00:07:05.224
"If you want to discuss it

00:07:05.224 --> 00:07:07.593
and tell them what you
learned, then you can."

00:07:07.593 --> 00:07:08.627
That's what she did.

00:07:08.627 --> 00:07:09.861
They made a decision.

00:07:09.861 --> 00:07:12.064
Even the government
minder made a decision

00:07:12.064 --> 00:07:15.067
to go talk to the head
of the hospital,

00:07:15.067 --> 00:07:16.235
not so far away,

00:07:16.235 --> 00:07:18.337
and they came back and they
talked to the village about

00:07:18.337 --> 00:07:20.606
the physical consequences
of early marriage

00:07:20.606 --> 00:07:22.975
and they ended up stopping
this particular wedding.

00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:27.112
This is a young girl
who was early 20's

00:07:27.112 --> 00:07:30.082
and already had
all those children.

00:07:30.082 --> 00:07:32.885
This is a young girl named Asia

00:07:32.885 --> 00:07:36.021
and she was 14 and
already had 2 children.

00:07:36.021 --> 00:07:38.023
She was still bleeding
from her pregnancy.

00:07:38.023 --> 00:07:40.258
She didn't know what was
going on with her body

00:07:40.258 --> 00:07:42.094
and that was one of
the scariest situations

00:07:42.094 --> 00:07:44.696
is them not knowing what's
going on with their bodies

00:07:44.696 --> 00:07:48.868
and why things are
happening to them.

00:07:48.868 --> 00:07:51.370
Yemen is one of the places
where it's most predominant.

00:07:51.370 --> 00:07:52.838
It's not as reported on

00:07:52.838 --> 00:07:55.641
because it's harder
to get statistics

00:07:55.641 --> 00:07:57.042
and whatnot from.

00:07:57.042 --> 00:07:59.845
But an amazing situation -
I went to one village in Hajjah

00:07:59.845 --> 00:08:01.380
and I said, "Can you show me

00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:02.982
where there are
some young girls

00:08:02.982 --> 00:08:04.549
who are married underage?"

00:08:04.549 --> 00:08:07.086
All of a sudden
all these girls come in

00:08:07.086 --> 00:08:09.621
and I was like, "Wow,
I was expecting like two."

00:08:09.621 --> 00:08:11.890
All these girls were married.

00:08:11.890 --> 00:08:14.092
A couple of them had children.

00:08:14.092 --> 00:08:16.895
Most of them were about 15, 16.

00:08:16.895 --> 00:08:19.564
Most of them were not in school
or had never been in school

00:08:19.564 --> 00:08:21.700
and I asked them
why hadn't they gone,

00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:24.770
and they said, "Because
there's no female teachers."

00:08:24.770 --> 00:08:26.338
When you have a culture
like this,

00:08:26.338 --> 00:08:27.672
where if you don't have girls,

00:08:27.672 --> 00:08:30.609
who are educated enough
to become teachers,

00:08:30.609 --> 00:08:33.012
then how do you
put female teachers

00:08:33.012 --> 00:08:34.513
in these rural areas.

00:08:34.513 --> 00:08:35.815
Because this isn't Sanaa.

00:08:35.815 --> 00:08:37.783
This isn't even Hodeidah.

00:08:37.783 --> 00:08:39.885
This is like
the rural village areas.

00:08:39.885 --> 00:08:42.521
And so, it's hard
to change a culture,

00:08:42.521 --> 00:08:44.323
cultural practices where...

00:08:44.323 --> 00:08:46.324
There's nothing for them
to do but get married

00:08:46.324 --> 00:08:48.427
if they're not educated
to do anything else.

00:08:48.427 --> 00:08:50.128
It was kind of a catch-22

00:08:50.128 --> 00:08:53.566
and I felt that that was
an important part of this story.

00:08:53.566 --> 00:08:54.933
Thank you.

00:08:54.933 --> 00:09:01.340
( audience clapping )

00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:04.509 line:0%
Cynthia: I started in
India in my field work

00:09:04.509 --> 00:09:06.211 line:0%
because it is the case of course

00:09:06.211 --> 00:09:08.180
that this happens
a great deal in India

00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:09.615
as well as other
countries, and India

00:09:09.615 --> 00:09:12.351
being one of the most populous
countries on the planet.

00:09:12.351 --> 00:09:14.787
There's a whole area
in Northern India,

00:09:14.787 --> 00:09:16.455
the state of Rajasthan,

00:09:16.455 --> 00:09:18.323
where this practice
is more widespread

00:09:18.323 --> 00:09:20.125
than anywhere else
concentrated in India,

00:09:20.125 --> 00:09:22.060
although it does take
place all over India.

00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:23.329
And in particular,

00:09:23.329 --> 00:09:25.731
there is a season in India
called Akha Teej,

00:09:25.731 --> 00:09:28.600
which it's not
specifically marriages

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:30.536
that are regarded as auspicious,

00:09:30.536 --> 00:09:32.438
as we came to learn
during Akha Teej.

00:09:32.438 --> 00:09:34.940
All new enterprises including
business enterprises

00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:36.007
are thought to
have a good start,

00:09:36.007 --> 00:09:39.312
if they take place
during this set of

00:09:39.312 --> 00:09:42.314
religious and astrological
holidays in Akha Teej.

00:09:42.314 --> 00:09:44.216
So I first went...

00:09:44.216 --> 00:09:47.386
Stephanie and I didn't
connected until the 2nd trip.

00:09:47.386 --> 00:09:49.654
I first went and
spent a lot of time

00:09:49.654 --> 00:09:51.356
just in the field,
as Stephanie says,

00:09:51.356 --> 00:09:52.958
just talking to people

00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:55.661
and coming to understand
how extraordinary,

00:09:55.661 --> 00:09:57.996
how extraordinarily
complicated this is.

00:09:57.996 --> 00:10:00.166
Here's something that we all
sort of know in the abstract,

00:10:00.166 --> 00:10:01.667
but it takes a very
different reality

00:10:01.667 --> 00:10:03.168
when you're in India.

00:10:03.168 --> 00:10:05.637
Many, many of the
marriages in India

00:10:05.637 --> 00:10:07.439
are arranged marriages.

00:10:07.439 --> 00:10:10.008
It remains to this day
the most common way

00:10:10.008 --> 00:10:11.776
for marriage to occur in India,

00:10:11.776 --> 00:10:13.278
for young men and young women.

00:10:13.278 --> 00:10:14.613
So the notion that there is

00:10:14.613 --> 00:10:17.649
some independent right
for a woman or a girl

00:10:17.649 --> 00:10:20.386
to select who she's gonna marry,
is regarded

00:10:20.386 --> 00:10:22.555
in many of the most
enlightened families in India

00:10:22.555 --> 00:10:24.022
as just nonsensical

00:10:24.022 --> 00:10:25.858
because that's not
the way you do it.

00:10:25.858 --> 00:10:27.593
A marriage, Indians
would say to me

00:10:27.593 --> 00:10:29.027
of all educational levels,

00:10:29.027 --> 00:10:30.529
is a joining of two families.

00:10:30.529 --> 00:10:31.931
It's not two, excuse me,

00:10:31.931 --> 00:10:34.733
two foolish young people
in love with each other

00:10:34.733 --> 00:10:35.968
deciding to get married.

00:10:35.968 --> 00:10:37.736
There's so very
much more at stake.

00:10:37.736 --> 00:10:40.138
So that goes out the door
right away.

00:10:40.138 --> 00:10:42.007
Then you think about a village.

00:10:42.007 --> 00:10:45.110
A very poor village,
as this one was,

00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:47.846
where the only option
for a girl growing up

00:10:47.846 --> 00:10:51.283
is to work on a field
in tremendous heat

00:10:51.283 --> 00:10:52.851
or tremendous monsoon,

00:10:52.851 --> 00:10:55.154
and suffer possibly
the consequences

00:10:55.154 --> 00:10:58.423
of having some young man
or boy have sex with her

00:10:58.423 --> 00:11:00.058
before she's married,

00:11:00.058 --> 00:11:02.394
which in that
culture renders her

00:11:02.394 --> 00:11:04.963
basically an outcast for
the rest of her life.

00:11:04.963 --> 00:11:06.865
So those are two things
right there

00:11:06.865 --> 00:11:08.634
that are very
different from anything

00:11:08.634 --> 00:11:12.437
that a typical American
or Western young woman

00:11:12.437 --> 00:11:15.640
might have to contemplate
in her future.

00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:19.044
This village is the one
that we went to

00:11:19.044 --> 00:11:21.213
after weeks and weeks and weeks

00:11:21.213 --> 00:11:22.881
of hanging around
on both of our parts.

00:11:22.881 --> 00:11:24.983
Stephanie is the most
amazing hanger-arounder

00:11:24.983 --> 00:11:26.686
waiting for things to
happen I've ever encountered

00:11:26.686 --> 00:11:28.821
and she does it in the most
brutal circumstances

00:11:28.821 --> 00:11:29.888
you can imagine.

00:11:29.988 --> 00:11:32.858
We had been told that there
were two adolescent girls,

00:11:32.858 --> 00:11:34.193
sisters who were
going to be married,

00:11:34.193 --> 00:11:36.161
and that it was going
to take place at night,

00:11:36.161 --> 00:11:38.697
and that if we were
very careful,

00:11:38.697 --> 00:11:40.632
and did all sorts of
elegant negotiations,

00:11:40.632 --> 00:11:42.601
and brought some kind of

00:11:42.601 --> 00:11:45.237
a token of respect
to the village, we could watch.

00:11:45.237 --> 00:11:47.540
We came, we were
prepared for the wedding

00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:49.441
of a 12-year old
and a 13-year old

00:11:49.441 --> 00:11:51.743
or something like
that we've been told.

00:11:51.743 --> 00:11:54.680
This is one of the
teenage girls preparing,

00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:56.215
putting on her makeup.

00:11:56.215 --> 00:11:58.683
This is a big event
both for the girls

00:11:58.683 --> 00:12:00.719
and for everyone in the village.

00:12:00.719 --> 00:12:02.954
The entire village is consumed

00:12:02.954 --> 00:12:05.524
by the festivities that
are coming to pass.

00:12:05.524 --> 00:12:10.463
This little girl was part
of the family that we met

00:12:10.463 --> 00:12:14.199
and her face will haunt me
for the rest of my days.

00:12:14.199 --> 00:12:15.601
That is very much
what she looked like.

00:12:15.601 --> 00:12:17.469
We first saw her
in the afternoon

00:12:17.469 --> 00:12:20.505
in her little pink dress as
she was wandering around.

00:12:20.505 --> 00:12:21.941
We said, "Who is that?"

00:12:21.941 --> 00:12:25.110
They said, "Oh, she's the
cousin of the two sisters."

00:12:25.110 --> 00:12:27.279
People were kind of
circumspect about it.

00:12:27.279 --> 00:12:30.249
Then they started putting
makeup on this little girl.

00:12:30.249 --> 00:12:31.450
I remember this room.

00:12:31.450 --> 00:12:32.918
It was a tiny little
room in the village.

00:12:32.918 --> 00:12:34.652
It was enormously hot.

00:12:34.652 --> 00:12:35.921
Everybody was crammed in there.

00:12:35.921 --> 00:12:38.423
Of course, there were only women
as you might imagine,

00:12:38.423 --> 00:12:39.592
crammed into this thing,

00:12:39.592 --> 00:12:40.992
and Stephanie and
I just sat watching

00:12:40.992 --> 00:12:42.861
and we all began to realize

00:12:42.861 --> 00:12:45.230
and our translator who
was also a young woman,

00:12:45.230 --> 00:12:48.500
began to realize what we
thought was likely to happen.

00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:51.336
This horrible feeling
grew in all of us.

00:12:51.336 --> 00:12:53.371
Stephanie had been
living with this reality

00:12:53.371 --> 00:12:55.507
for many years
longer than any of us

00:12:55.507 --> 00:12:57.242
but I think, if I'm
not mistaken Stephanie,

00:12:57.242 --> 00:12:58.543
that this was the first time

00:12:58.543 --> 00:13:01.980
you had actually seen
a child this young

00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:04.950
being prepared for what
looked like her wedding.

00:13:04.950 --> 00:13:06.418
The women gathered around.

00:13:06.418 --> 00:13:08.854
There were many, many
prenuptial traditions.

00:13:08.854 --> 00:13:10.422
Some of which were
quite beautiful

00:13:10.422 --> 00:13:11.824
in the tremendous heat.

00:13:11.824 --> 00:13:14.360
I remember them walking
with crockery on their head

00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:16.495
across a long field.

00:13:16.495 --> 00:13:18.897
At one point, the cloth
that you see behind...

00:13:18.897 --> 00:13:21.733
They had multiple kinds
of beautiful sari cloth

00:13:21.733 --> 00:13:23.268
strung out all over the village

00:13:23.268 --> 00:13:25.571
to make canopies, to
make celebratory places

00:13:25.571 --> 00:13:28.673
because people were gonna
come from far and wide.

00:13:28.673 --> 00:13:30.943
The women are standing behind.

00:13:30.943 --> 00:13:33.746
There's the three girls
and they're all bathing.

00:13:33.746 --> 00:13:35.580
They're in the dirt

00:13:35.580 --> 00:13:38.783
and now they were
washing the little girl

00:13:38.783 --> 00:13:40.685
and now we understood for sure

00:13:40.685 --> 00:13:44.056
that she was gonna be
part of the wedding.

00:13:44.056 --> 00:13:46.691
The proceedings
went on for hours.

00:13:46.691 --> 00:13:49.361
That's typical for
an Indian wedding.

00:13:49.361 --> 00:13:51.062
It's especially
typical for weddings

00:13:51.062 --> 00:13:52.798
in this part of Northern India,

00:13:52.798 --> 00:13:54.933
where when they are
breaking the law,

00:13:54.933 --> 00:13:58.270
as it's important to
remember they were doing.

00:13:58.270 --> 00:14:00.706
This is not a legal
practice in India.

00:14:00.706 --> 00:14:03.208
It has not been
for over a century

00:14:03.208 --> 00:14:05.811
and that's the case
in most, not all,

00:14:05.811 --> 00:14:07.045
but most of the countries

00:14:07.045 --> 00:14:09.147
in which child
marriage takes place.

00:14:09.147 --> 00:14:11.249
If you go
to the Indian authorities

00:14:11.249 --> 00:14:13.952
at the state,
at the provincial...,
local level,

00:14:13.952 --> 00:14:15.855
the state level and
the national level,

00:14:15.855 --> 00:14:18.957
they will decry this
practice just as vigorously

00:14:18.957 --> 00:14:21.293
as anyone here in
the United States would,

00:14:21.293 --> 00:14:22.895
but they will also say

00:14:22.895 --> 00:14:25.263
it's very difficult to
climb into these cultures

00:14:25.263 --> 00:14:26.865
and find out what's going on,

00:14:26.865 --> 00:14:28.166
and furthermore,

00:14:28.166 --> 00:14:31.737
when you do get the word
of what's going on,

00:14:31.737 --> 00:14:33.505
if you try to stop it...

00:14:33.505 --> 00:14:34.773
Which way they
will sometimes do.

00:14:34.773 --> 00:14:35.773
They will make a great show,

00:14:35.773 --> 00:14:37.509
they will throw someone in jail.

00:14:37.509 --> 00:14:40.112
You'll have probably
disgraced that family

00:14:40.112 --> 00:14:42.381
for a generation to come.

00:14:42.381 --> 00:14:44.716
You have probably
not stopped the girl

00:14:44.716 --> 00:14:46.551
from getting married too early.

00:14:46.551 --> 00:14:48.520
You've certainly
not given her a life

00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:52.858
which would be a healthy
option to being married.

00:14:52.858 --> 00:14:54.292
What have you done?

00:14:54.292 --> 00:14:56.361
It's a huge and complex problem.

00:14:56.361 --> 00:15:00.665
The night comes,
the ceremonial fire is lit

00:15:00.665 --> 00:15:03.902
and the expression on
the children's face

00:15:03.902 --> 00:15:08.240
is one of pretty much utter
bewilderment, I would say.

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:10.709
The extent to which
this young boy,

00:15:10.709 --> 00:15:13.545
who is about three years
older than our five year old,

00:15:13.545 --> 00:15:15.247
understood what was going on,

00:15:15.247 --> 00:15:18.283
it was really not
possible for us to know.

00:15:18.283 --> 00:15:22.888
The older brothers
were obviously clearer

00:15:22.888 --> 00:15:24.589
about what was happening.

00:15:24.589 --> 00:15:26.525
These children were not

00:15:26.525 --> 00:15:29.661
and it's also because it's
such a long-drawn-out ceremony,

00:15:29.661 --> 00:15:31.163
it has none of what we regard

00:15:31.163 --> 00:15:34.132
as the sort of tidiness
of a Western ceremony.

00:15:34.132 --> 00:15:36.935
"I now pronounce you husband
and wife". Boom, we're done.

00:15:36.935 --> 00:15:38.837
It went on and on and on.

00:15:40.405 --> 00:15:42.875
This is the picture
that haunts me still

00:15:42.875 --> 00:15:45.744
and the reason I wanted
to show it you afterward

00:15:45.744 --> 00:15:48.980
is that this pictures
conveys utterly

00:15:48.980 --> 00:15:51.783
the confusing feeling
of that evening.

00:15:51.783 --> 00:15:53.818
At this moment,
she's taking a nap.

00:15:53.818 --> 00:15:55.620
She's been awaken from her nap

00:15:55.620 --> 00:15:58.323
and she's being
carried to the ceremony

00:15:58.323 --> 00:16:00.459
and the tenderness that
you see in this picture,

00:16:00.459 --> 00:16:02.027
on behalf of the
man holding her,

00:16:02.027 --> 00:16:03.962
was absolutely
what we saw there.

00:16:03.962 --> 00:16:05.630
It was one of the most
complicated scenes

00:16:05.630 --> 00:16:07.499
I had ever seen as a reporter.

00:16:07.499 --> 00:16:09.401
Knowing that this
child is going off

00:16:09.401 --> 00:16:11.903
to something that is
a horrifying notion to me

00:16:11.903 --> 00:16:14.173
and at the same time,
it being very clear

00:16:14.173 --> 00:16:15.707
that the people
who were doing it,

00:16:15.707 --> 00:16:17.509
including this uncle
who's carrying her,

00:16:17.509 --> 00:16:18.777
love her deeply

00:16:18.777 --> 00:16:20.411
and think they're doing
the right thing for her.

00:16:20.411 --> 00:16:22.681
It is important also to remember

00:16:22.681 --> 00:16:24.850
that in India, unlike some
of the other countries,

00:16:24.850 --> 00:16:27.552
there is a second
ceremony that takes place.

00:16:27.552 --> 00:16:29.287
The plan typically,
although not always,

00:16:29.287 --> 00:16:30.923
is that this child
will live at home,

00:16:30.923 --> 00:16:32.590
in this case with
her grandfather,

00:16:32.590 --> 00:16:34.826
and she will not go
to her husband's family

00:16:34.826 --> 00:16:36.661
until she's past puberty.

00:16:36.661 --> 00:16:38.630
That second ceremony
was called<i> gauna</i>

00:16:38.630 --> 00:16:40.099
and part of what
they do in India

00:16:40.099 --> 00:16:42.568
is try as hard as they
can to postpone the<i> gauna</i> ,

00:16:42.568 --> 00:16:44.669
but it was the gentleness

00:16:44.669 --> 00:16:46.671
with which this man
lifted her from sleep

00:16:46.671 --> 00:16:48.874
and took her to the ceremony,

00:16:48.874 --> 00:16:50.375
that really haunted me,

00:16:50.375 --> 00:16:52.144
and made me realize
how far I had come

00:16:52.144 --> 00:16:54.245
from my original
absolute clarity

00:16:54.245 --> 00:16:58.083
about everybody involved in
this practice being simply evil.

00:16:58.083 --> 00:17:01.887
Now, this child is someone

00:17:01.887 --> 00:17:05.056
for whom I want you
to have some hope.

00:17:05.056 --> 00:17:06.925
I talked to you originally
about some of the reasons

00:17:06.925 --> 00:17:10.762
that a parent, a loving
parent would do this.

00:17:10.762 --> 00:17:12.563
You're protecting your
child from possible rape

00:17:12.563 --> 00:17:14.733
because you live in a society

00:17:14.733 --> 00:17:17.436
in which loss of
virginity before marriage

00:17:17.436 --> 00:17:20.906
renders a young woman
an outcast, number one.

00:17:20.906 --> 00:17:24.642
Number two, you
know in the abstract

00:17:24.642 --> 00:17:25.977
that people from the government

00:17:25.977 --> 00:17:27.846
have told you
schooling is important.

00:17:27.846 --> 00:17:30.048
But that's kind of irrelevant
when you live in a village

00:17:30.048 --> 00:17:32.384
where the only schooling
your child can get to

00:17:32.384 --> 00:17:34.018
goes up to fifth grade.

00:17:34.018 --> 00:17:37.756
After fifth grade, there's a
long bus ride that's required.

00:17:37.756 --> 00:17:40.325
There are predatory
men on the bus

00:17:40.325 --> 00:17:42.227
which makes the bus
ride itself dangerous.

00:17:42.227 --> 00:17:43.862
If you're in a
culture like this,

00:17:43.862 --> 00:17:45.864
you don't send your
child to that school

00:17:45.864 --> 00:17:47.399
no matter what a government
person is telling you

00:17:47.399 --> 00:17:49.668
about the importance
of schooling.

00:17:49.668 --> 00:17:51.869
That stops right there.

00:17:51.869 --> 00:17:55.974
If you have no cultural option,

00:17:55.974 --> 00:17:58.410
no effective schooling
past fifth grade,

00:17:58.410 --> 00:18:00.879
no tradition of regard

00:18:00.879 --> 00:18:03.481
for the importance
of individual right

00:18:03.481 --> 00:18:05.750
in choosing a marriage,

00:18:05.750 --> 00:18:08.386
a clear life
involving rural life,

00:18:08.386 --> 00:18:11.924
agricultural work and some
kind of poverty in your future,

00:18:11.924 --> 00:18:14.126
what do you do to
protect your child?

00:18:14.126 --> 00:18:16.528
You make sure she's
marrying into a good family

00:18:16.528 --> 00:18:18.830
and you do it very young

00:18:18.830 --> 00:18:20.398
so that she won't be attacked.

00:18:20.398 --> 00:18:21.800
She'll have some sort of respect

00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:23.635
as a married child already,

00:18:23.635 --> 00:18:26.238
and so that there's no chance
that she can go astray.

00:18:27.372 --> 00:18:33.378
This child lived in a village
some distance away

00:18:33.378 --> 00:18:36.147
from the one we'd
been at previously.

00:18:36.147 --> 00:18:38.049
She had been in a school

00:18:38.049 --> 00:18:39.951
where the government
teachers understood

00:18:39.951 --> 00:18:41.687
how bad child marriage was,

00:18:41.687 --> 00:18:44.822
and they had really drummed
into all of the children,

00:18:44.822 --> 00:18:46.791
"Don't do this. Don't do this."

00:18:46.791 --> 00:18:49.161
Her older sister
was getting married

00:18:49.161 --> 00:18:51.162
in a house just
a few houses away

00:18:51.162 --> 00:18:53.264
and the night of
the older sister's wedding,

00:18:53.264 --> 00:18:55.967
her mother drew her aside
and said, "You too."

00:18:55.967 --> 00:18:57.669
Tied a string around her wrist

00:18:57.669 --> 00:19:00.506
which was part of
the ceremonial process.

00:19:00.506 --> 00:19:02.040
She jumped up

00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:03.875
and according to everybody
that we talked to,

00:19:03.875 --> 00:19:05.276
including the mother,

00:19:05.276 --> 00:19:06.844
said to her mother and father,

00:19:06.844 --> 00:19:09.080
"If you do that,
I will call the police

00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:10.915
and I will break your
head with a rock."

00:19:10.915 --> 00:19:12.851
Those were her actual words.

00:19:12.851 --> 00:19:14.052
She ran...

00:19:14.052 --> 00:19:16.521
The mom finally said this
to me with some pride.

00:19:16.521 --> 00:19:18.223
This was some months afterward.

00:19:18.223 --> 00:19:20.825
She ran up the street
to the home of a village worker.

00:19:20.825 --> 00:19:22.494
They have these India.

00:19:22.494 --> 00:19:25.897
They are paid for,
very nominally, by
the local governments

00:19:25.897 --> 00:19:27.799
and their job is
to monitor public health

00:19:27.799 --> 00:19:29.467
in a general sort of way.

00:19:29.467 --> 00:19:30.535
The village worker went over

00:19:30.535 --> 00:19:34.172
with her own parents
and in-laws to the village

00:19:34.172 --> 00:19:35.573
and said, "Don't ... "

00:19:35.573 --> 00:19:36.674
To this house and
said, "Don't do this.

00:19:36.674 --> 00:19:38.042
Let us tell you all the reasons

00:19:38.042 --> 00:19:40.012
that this is a bad thing
for your daughter."

00:19:40.012 --> 00:19:43.281
Astonishingly finally, there
was a huge row apparently,

00:19:43.281 --> 00:19:45.283
the entire village got in on it,

00:19:45.283 --> 00:19:47.285
the parents were persuaded.

00:19:47.285 --> 00:19:49.554
She was not married off

00:19:49.554 --> 00:19:52.323
and by the time I met
her some months later,

00:19:52.323 --> 00:19:55.527
she was an avid cricket player

00:19:55.527 --> 00:19:58.096
and those are
movie star pictures

00:19:58.096 --> 00:19:59.897
that she has up in her room,

00:19:59.897 --> 00:20:01.399
and she was preparing to go on

00:20:01.399 --> 00:20:03.935
to middle school and beyond.

00:20:03.935 --> 00:20:27.326
( lighthearted music )

00:20:27.326 --> 00:20:49.514
( calm music )
