ERICA FOX: Hi, everyone.

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:10.650
Thanks for joining us live
and on the livestream.

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.260
And it's my great pleasure
to have this conversation

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:14.910
today with Alison.

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:16.830
And for those of
you who have not

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.920
yet read her book
"On the Edge," I

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.490
thought we might start by
having her take us back

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.020
to May 24, 2010 and
tell us a little bit

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:30.390
about that day and that moment.

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.780
ALISON LEVINE: May
24, 2010 was the day

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.010
that I completed what's known as
the Adventure Grand Slam, which

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.900
is climbing the seven
summits, the highest

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.180
peak on each continent,
and then skiing to both

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.790
the North and the South Pole.

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:48.090
May 24, 2010 is when I summited
Mount Everest to complete

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.170
the Adventure Grand Slam.

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.620
And it was my second
attempt at the mountain.

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.320
I made my first attempt in 2002.

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.200
I was the team captain of the
First American Women's Everest

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:58.770
Expedition.

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.710
And we got this
close to the summit

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.690
and had to turn
around in bad weather.

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.270
We turned around just a few
hundred feet in a storm.

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.737
So that was, of
course, disappointing.

00:01:08.737 --> 00:01:10.820
Because we were the First
American Women's Everest

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:12.480
Expedition, we had all
this media coverage.

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:13.604
And then we didn't make it.

00:01:13.604 --> 00:01:16.357
And it took me eight years
before I got up enough guts

00:01:16.357 --> 00:01:18.190
to go back to the
mountain and try it again.

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:19.560
But I went back in 2010.

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.060
Did make it to the summit.

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.180
And that was the
Adventure Grand Slam.

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:27.600
ERICA FOX: It's hard
to even fathom what

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.755
goes into that accomplishment.

00:01:30.755 --> 00:01:32.130
So could you tell
us a little bit

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.700
about the path
that got you there?

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.670
And particularly from
reading your book,

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.050
it seems quite an unusual
path starting in there's

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:45.330
some investment banking time.

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:46.900
There's some other adventures.

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.025
And I thought that this
group would be particularly

00:01:49.025 --> 00:01:51.660
interested in that, because
many individuals here at Google

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:53.354
have quite unusual paths.

00:01:53.354 --> 00:01:55.770
And if they trace back how
they got to where they are now,

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.690
they might not have ever
anticipated where they are.

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:58.988
So I'd love for
you to just walk us

00:01:58.988 --> 00:01:59.220
through a little bit of that.

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:00.053
ALISON LEVINE: Sure.

00:02:00.053 --> 00:02:02.700
Well, when I was younger,
for whatever reason,

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.465
I was just very intrigued by
the stories of the early Arctic

00:02:05.465 --> 00:02:07.590
and Antarctic explorers
and the early mountaineers.

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:08.729
So I'd read these books.

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.800
I'd watched documentary films.

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.529
And long story short, but I was
born with a hole in my heart

00:02:13.529 --> 00:02:14.820
that got bigger as I got older.

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:16.650
So I've had three
heart surgeries.

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.080
But after my second one,
when I was 30 years old,

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:21.330
I had my second heart surgery.

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.460
And I was in pretty
good health after that.

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:25.710
And about 18 months
after that procedure,

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:27.210
this light bulb
went on in my head.

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:29.340
And I thought, all
right, if I want

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.580
to know what it's like
to be Reinhold Messner

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:36.046
and drag a 150-pound sled across
600 miles of Antarctic ice,

00:02:36.046 --> 00:02:37.920
then I should get out
there and do it instead

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:38.961
of just reading about it.

00:02:38.961 --> 00:02:42.752
If I want to know what it's like
to be these early mountaineers

00:02:42.752 --> 00:02:45.210
and these explorers that are
going to these remote mountain

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:47.430
regions, then I should go
to remote mountain regions

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.690
instead of just watching
documentary films about it.

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:52.980
And so that kind of sparked
this interest in me.

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.160
And I started having
these adventures.

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.250
And of course, I
started on lower peaks

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:02.010
that didn't have a lot of
technical requirements.

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.710
You could just walk
up Kilimanjaro, right?

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:08.790
If you had determination,
you could do this mountain

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.160
because it doesn't require
any technical abilities,

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.194
it just requires some stamina--

00:03:13.194 --> 00:03:13.860
ERICA FOX: Grit.

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.060
ALISON LEVINE: --and grit.

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:16.230
Exactly Right?

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:21.202
So I am from Arizona, so I
didn't have any warm clothes.

00:03:21.202 --> 00:03:22.910
And I borrowed warm
clothes from friends.

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:26.100
I borrowed a backpack, a
tent, everything I needed.

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.680
Used frequent flyer miles
to go to the base of Mount

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:29.820
Kilimanjaro in Tanzania--

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:30.972
I just went by myself--

00:03:30.972 --> 00:03:33.555
hired a guide at the base of the
mountain for a couple hundred

00:03:33.555 --> 00:03:35.842
bucks, and ended up
climbing Kilimanjaro.

00:03:35.842 --> 00:03:37.800
And that was the first
mountain that I climbed.

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:41.550
And that was where I found
that voice in my head

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:44.340
that told me that I
could keep going when

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.650
I felt like I wanted to quit.

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:51.150
And it was that voice that
really gave me the confidence

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:53.760
to know that no matter what
mountain I was tackling,

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.500
from that point on,
I had that voice

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.130
that told me that
I could keep going.

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:58.320
So it is really about grit.

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:01.114
So that's just kind of how I
started going to the mountains

00:04:01.114 --> 00:04:02.280
and having these adventures.

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:06.120
But I never really planned
on completing the seven

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.370
summits, you know, the highest
peak on each continent,

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:10.140
or completing the
Adventure Grand

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:12.240
Slam by skiing to the
North and South Pole

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:14.880
in addition to seven summits,
but it just kind of happened

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:15.550
over time.

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:17.220
And I would go on
these adventures

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:20.040
and I would meet people
climbing that would invite me

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:21.149
on other adventures.

00:04:21.149 --> 00:04:24.450
And by the time I went
back to Everest in 2010,

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:27.289
I had climbed the highest
peak on six continents, skied

00:04:27.289 --> 00:04:28.830
to both the North
and the South Pole,

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:31.456
and I knew it was
just that one mountain

00:04:31.456 --> 00:04:33.830
that I needed to do to complete
the Adventure Grand Slam.

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:36.870
But in between
doing all of that,

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:39.660
I did have a normal, you
know, semi-normal career.

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:43.380
I worked in pharmaceutical
and medical device industry.

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:46.024
I worked in investment
banking for a couple of years

00:04:46.024 --> 00:04:47.190
right after graduate school.

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:48.600
I got an MBA.

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:50.280
And when I went to
get my MBA, I thought

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:52.680
it was because I was going to
start this adventure travel

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:53.190
company.

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:56.250
And then somehow I got roped
into this investment banking

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:58.884
job, because I wanted to learn
about finance and accounting

00:04:58.884 --> 00:05:00.300
and things I had
no background in.

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.251
And I thought if I wanted
to do that, I should

00:05:02.251 --> 00:05:04.500
try to go to Wall Street,
because that's where I could

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:07.710
get my feet wet in those areas.

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:09.690
And so one thing led to another.

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:12.740
But I just kept
feeling this pull back

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:14.250
to the adventure world.

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:17.870
So the investment banking
thing didn't last very long.

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:20.390
ERICA FOX: So as the mom of
two middle-schoolers right now,

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:25.520
I just can't help but ask,
what were you like as a child?

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:29.420
And did you have this
draw to adventure,

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:33.622
this draw to putting yourself
out there and not quitting?

00:05:33.622 --> 00:05:35.330
Did you see signs of
that at a young age?

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:36.371
ALISON LEVINE: It didn't.

00:05:36.371 --> 00:05:40.300
So I think I liked frustrating
my parents as a child probably.

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:42.500
I mean, who doesn't?

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:46.280
But I didn't really think
that I could do anything

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:49.580
like this until I turned 30 and
I had that second heart surgery

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:51.680
and I was in much better health.

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:54.140
And at that point, I
just thought, well,

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:55.400
what's holding me back?

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:58.460
I don't have any
health challenges

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:00.110
that are preventing
me from doing this.

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:02.120
I do have what's called
Raynaud's disease, which

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:05.904
is a disease where
the nerves clamp down

00:06:05.904 --> 00:06:07.820
on the blood vessels in
your fingers and toes,

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:09.620
cutting off your circulation.

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:13.516
So doctors have always told
me to avoid cold environments.

00:06:13.516 --> 00:06:15.140
And of course, I
didn't listen to that.

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:16.790
But I just used
those hand warmers.

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:21.890
I figure there's always a way
around these roadblocks, right?

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:24.274
So for me, they said
no cold environments,

00:06:24.274 --> 00:06:25.940
because your hands
and toes will freeze.

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:28.760
And I was like, can't I
just use those hand warmers?

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:32.120
Sometimes there's a
really simple solution

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:35.400
to something that feels like
it's an overwhelming problem.

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:40.580
And so I don't think I did
anything too crazy or too

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:41.480
adventurous as a kid.

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:44.589
But I probably did
drive my parents crazy.

00:06:44.589 --> 00:06:46.130
ERICA FOX: So you
talked a little bit

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:48.760
about what fuels you
in terms of don't

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:53.930
go read about the mountains,
go and put yourself there.

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:56.630
Once you got back
from those trips,

00:06:56.630 --> 00:06:59.030
what then did you tap
into that compelled

00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:01.430
you to get involved in
more leadership work

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:04.640
to take this path forward?

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:07.710
ALISON LEVINE: I realized
that there was a lot of blood,

00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:10.400
sweat, and tears that goes into
these expeditions, everything

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:14.060
from pre-expedition training
and planning and getting

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:17.570
the logistics organized and then
the time that you're actually

00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:22.379
on the mountain or in
Antarctica or the Arctic Circle

00:07:22.379 --> 00:07:24.170
or wherever you are
doing these adventures.

00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:27.080
And sometimes you don't
always achieve the goal

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:28.290
that you set out to achieve.

00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:31.490
And I figured out that
if you focus solely

00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:34.550
on getting to the
top of a mountain,

00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:37.700
you are missing
so much of what is

00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:39.740
important about these
types of adventures.

00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:43.850
Because standing on top of a
mountain doesn't change you.

00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:45.050
It doesn't change the world.

00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:46.220
It doesn't change anything.

00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:49.910
What's important are the lessons
that you learn along the way

00:07:49.910 --> 00:07:53.180
when you're fighting like hell
to get up there and then what

00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:54.950
you're going to do
with that information

00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:56.660
to be better going forward.

00:07:56.660 --> 00:07:59.360
And I figured out
by really studying

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:00.770
the art and science
of leadership

00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:03.521
and by sharing my experiences
with others, whether it's

00:08:03.521 --> 00:08:05.270
something like this
that we're doing today

00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:08.480
or lecturing at a corporate
event or my time spent

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:11.120
on the part-time
faculty at West Point,

00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:15.020
sharing those leadership lessons
is what changes the world

00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:18.122
and is what helps people
become better in whatever area

00:08:18.122 --> 00:08:19.580
they're trying to
become better in.

00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:21.830
So for me, focusing on
the leadership stuff

00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:24.860
was a way that I could take my
experiences from the mountain

00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:29.690
and share them in a way that
would actually help people.

00:08:29.690 --> 00:08:33.830
ERICA FOX: And in what ways
has being a woman contributed

00:08:33.830 --> 00:08:38.179
to the way you show up as
a leader, your professional

00:08:38.179 --> 00:08:40.250
and athletic successes?

00:08:40.250 --> 00:08:42.559
ALISON LEVINE: So
being a woman, and I

00:08:42.559 --> 00:08:46.400
know this is going to sound
like something I shouldn't say,

00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:51.540
but being a woman in certain
situations is a disadvantage.

00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:54.080
And I know before everyone's
like, wait a minute!

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:56.060
So in the business
world, I do feel

00:08:56.060 --> 00:08:58.280
like women can compete
with men on every level,

00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:02.510
whether it's intellectual
capability or creativity

00:09:02.510 --> 00:09:04.460
or determination or
whatever it takes

00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:06.290
to be really good at your job.

00:09:06.290 --> 00:09:08.550
But when it comes to
these expeditions,

00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:11.630
while we like to think
that everybody's equal,

00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:14.630
the law of physics
basically dictates

00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:15.890
that we're not all equal.

00:09:15.890 --> 00:09:17.480
And it's not just
about being a woman,

00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:20.480
necessarily, it's about being
someone who's my size, right?

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:24.330
So it's not my gender,
it's my physical size.

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:28.640
So what I discovered when
I went on this South Pole

00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:30.680
expedition-- and this is
a chapter in the book.

00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:31.550
It's chapter six.

00:09:31.550 --> 00:09:33.883
And it seems to be everyone's
favorite chapter, I think,

00:09:33.883 --> 00:09:36.260
because it's a
very honest chapter

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:39.570
about a difficult situation
where I really struggled.

00:09:39.570 --> 00:09:42.470
But I showed up for the
South Pole expedition.

00:09:42.470 --> 00:09:45.680
And I always train as hard as
I can before an expedition,

00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:47.296
because that's just who I am.

00:09:47.296 --> 00:09:48.170
I'm going to show up.

00:09:48.170 --> 00:09:49.086
I'm going to be ready.

00:09:49.086 --> 00:09:50.150
I'm going to be prepared.

00:09:50.150 --> 00:09:53.720
There's no way I'm not going
to be the most prepared person

00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:56.300
on the trip, because I feel
like I owe it to my teammates

00:09:56.300 --> 00:09:57.950
to be that person.

00:09:57.950 --> 00:10:01.550
So I trained as hard as I could,
showed up for this expedition.

00:10:01.550 --> 00:10:03.920
And what I discovered was
that even though I trained

00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:08.590
really hard, that
my size was what

00:10:08.590 --> 00:10:11.190
was preventing me
from performing

00:10:11.190 --> 00:10:12.190
as well as my teammates.

00:10:12.190 --> 00:10:15.190
So like I said, the law
of physics basically

00:10:15.190 --> 00:10:17.535
dictates that somebody
who's my size--

00:10:17.535 --> 00:10:19.600
5'4, about 112 pounds--

00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:24.160
is not going to be able to pull
a 150-pound sled as quickly

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:29.590
or as efficiently as somebody
who is 6'3, 220, 230 pounds.

00:10:29.590 --> 00:10:32.980
So I wasn't able to keep
up with my teammates.

00:10:32.980 --> 00:10:35.740
And it was very
evident that I was

00:10:35.740 --> 00:10:38.470
the slowest person on the team,
because I was behind everybody.

00:10:38.470 --> 00:10:40.390
And it really caused me
a lot of frustration,

00:10:40.390 --> 00:10:42.130
because my teammates
were constantly

00:10:42.130 --> 00:10:43.387
having to wait for me.

00:10:43.387 --> 00:10:45.220
And you might think
that that's no big deal.

00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:48.790
But in Antarctica, when you have
to stop and wait for somebody,

00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:50.870
you're going to get cold, right?

00:10:50.870 --> 00:10:52.210
So here I am.

00:10:52.210 --> 00:10:55.120
My teammates are potentially
becoming hypothermic waiting

00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:57.100
for me, because I am
the slowest, weakest

00:10:57.100 --> 00:10:58.270
person on the team.

00:10:58.270 --> 00:11:01.540
No matter how hard I tried, I
was still the slowest, weakest

00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:02.440
person on the team.

00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:06.460
And I thought about
how I perceived

00:11:06.460 --> 00:11:08.080
slower, weaker people, right?

00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:09.970
Whether it was in a
business environment

00:11:09.970 --> 00:11:12.980
or on an expedition, I used
to think about slower people

00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:16.960
and think, oh, man, I wish that
person wasn't part of my team.

00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:17.920
That person is weaker.

00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:19.510
That person is holding us back.

00:11:19.510 --> 00:11:21.370
That person is slowing us down.

00:11:21.370 --> 00:11:24.010
We would be so much better,
so much more productive

00:11:24.010 --> 00:11:25.370
if we didn't have that person.

00:11:25.370 --> 00:11:29.740
So maybe that person will
transfer to another division

00:11:29.740 --> 00:11:32.620
or quit this job or
quit this expedition

00:11:32.620 --> 00:11:35.290
or choose to be a
part of another team.

00:11:35.290 --> 00:11:37.880
Please just get
them off of my team.

00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:40.210
Well, all of a sudden,
I'm that person.

00:11:40.210 --> 00:11:41.860
I'm the slowest, weakest person.

00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:45.190
And that really caused me to
double down on my frustration.

00:11:45.190 --> 00:11:47.140
Because not only was I
struggling physically,

00:11:47.140 --> 00:11:49.990
but now I was struggling
psychologically

00:11:49.990 --> 00:11:53.050
and emotionally, just knowing
for sure that nobody wanted me

00:11:53.050 --> 00:11:54.490
on the team.

00:11:54.490 --> 00:11:57.730
And the way our
team leader handled

00:11:57.730 --> 00:12:02.050
this situation changed
my approach to leadership

00:12:02.050 --> 00:12:03.730
completely.

00:12:03.730 --> 00:12:06.880
So instead of
saying to me, you're

00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:08.770
slower, you're weaker
you're holding us back,

00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:11.860
what's the problem, I
overheard our team leader

00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:14.170
Eric talking in his tent
to my teammate George.

00:12:14.170 --> 00:12:17.044
And I heard Eric
say, poor Alison.

00:12:17.044 --> 00:12:19.210
She's really struggling
with the weight of her sled.

00:12:19.210 --> 00:12:20.470
And George said, I know.

00:12:20.470 --> 00:12:22.060
She's so much smaller
than everybody.

00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:23.260
We should really
try to help her out.

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:24.610
And Eric said, yeah,
we're going to do that.

00:12:24.610 --> 00:12:26.050
We're going to help her out.

00:12:26.050 --> 00:12:28.720
And the next day, they
got out of their tent.

00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:30.940
And Eric said, hey!

00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:32.830
Before we start
off today, I just

00:12:32.830 --> 00:12:35.262
want to weigh everybody's
sled and make sure they're

00:12:35.262 --> 00:12:36.470
about the same weight, right?

00:12:36.470 --> 00:12:39.239
Because you have this
big 150-pound sled.

00:12:39.239 --> 00:12:40.780
And George said,
yeah, let's do that.

00:12:40.780 --> 00:12:42.404
Let's make sure
they're all about even.

00:12:42.404 --> 00:12:45.670
So they get out of their
tent and they pick up

00:12:45.670 --> 00:12:47.530
the end of George's sled.

00:12:47.530 --> 00:12:50.390
And they're like, oh, OK,
yeah, this one feels good.

00:12:50.390 --> 00:12:51.730
Let's weigh Eric's sled.

00:12:51.730 --> 00:12:53.515
They pick up the
end of Eric's sled.

00:12:53.515 --> 00:12:54.730
Yeah, this one feels good.

00:12:54.730 --> 00:12:56.090
Let's weigh Merete's sled.

00:12:56.090 --> 00:12:59.350
They each pick up the end
of this big 150-pound sled.

00:12:59.350 --> 00:13:01.120
OK, yeah, this one feels good.

00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:02.890
All right, let's
weigh Alison's sled.

00:13:02.890 --> 00:13:05.350
And they each get on
the end of my sled.

00:13:05.350 --> 00:13:06.040
They pick it up.

00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:08.440
They get it six
inches off the ground.

00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:09.710
And they both drop it.

00:13:09.710 --> 00:13:11.490
And they're like, oh, my god!

00:13:11.490 --> 00:13:14.620
And This is the heaviest sled!

00:13:14.620 --> 00:13:15.526
This is so crazy!

00:13:15.526 --> 00:13:16.900
Why are you carrying
so much more

00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:18.170
weight than everybody else?

00:13:18.170 --> 00:13:20.800
And I knew what they were
doing, because I overheard them.

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:22.846
And I thought, um, well.

00:13:22.846 --> 00:13:24.220
Eric's like, well,
this is crazy.

00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:25.470
We got to make this more even.

00:13:25.470 --> 00:13:28.240
And they pulled weight
out of my sled, right?

00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:29.980
They took a couple
fuel canisters out,

00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:33.220
they lightened up my sled
so that I could keep up

00:13:33.220 --> 00:13:34.390
with everybody else.

00:13:34.390 --> 00:13:37.270
And now their sleds
are heavier than mine.

00:13:37.270 --> 00:13:41.060
So I start thinking, wow,
what an amazing leader.

00:13:41.060 --> 00:13:43.060
He let me keep my pride intact.

00:13:43.060 --> 00:13:45.880
He made me feel like I was a
valuable member of the team.

00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:47.620
And instead of saying,
hey, you're slow,

00:13:47.620 --> 00:13:49.411
we're going to take
weight out of your sled

00:13:49.411 --> 00:13:53.080
and make our sleds heavier,
they sent me a message

00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:56.470
that they wanted me to succeed
and they wanted to support me.

00:13:56.470 --> 00:13:59.260
So I immediately
start thinking, what

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:01.420
am I going to do to pay
these people back, right?

00:14:01.420 --> 00:14:03.670
Because they've
helped me sort of

00:14:03.670 --> 00:14:05.770
compensate for this weakness.

00:14:05.770 --> 00:14:08.470
They've helped me, in a sense,
overcome it at the time.

00:14:08.470 --> 00:14:13.800
And so what I noticed was
these taller guys, the men who

00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:17.050
were taller, they were
really wrenching their backs

00:14:17.050 --> 00:14:18.640
trying to shovel snow every day.

00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:21.070
Because at the end of
skiing for 15 hours,

00:14:21.070 --> 00:14:23.009
at the end of the day,
you pitch this tent

00:14:23.009 --> 00:14:25.300
and you have to build a snow
barricade around your tent

00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:26.680
to protect it from the elements.

00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:29.620
So you're already
completely exhausted, right?

00:14:29.620 --> 00:14:31.900
And then you have to
build your snow barricade.

00:14:31.900 --> 00:14:34.360
And I noticed these taller
guys wrenching their backs

00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:36.880
trying to shovel snow
to build the barricade

00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:38.260
around their tent.

00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:40.870
So that next night after they
took weight out of my sled,

00:14:40.870 --> 00:14:45.670
I said, hey, you guys,
can I shovel the snow

00:14:45.670 --> 00:14:46.690
around your tent?

00:14:46.690 --> 00:14:50.080
Because I'm shorter,
so I can shovel snow

00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:52.180
without screwing up my back.

00:14:52.180 --> 00:14:55.020
So I said, hey, can I shovel
the snow around your tent?

00:14:55.020 --> 00:14:57.420
And Eric said, you
want to do what?

00:14:57.420 --> 00:14:59.405
And I said, I want
to shovel the snow

00:14:59.405 --> 00:15:01.030
to make the barricade
around your tent.

00:15:01.030 --> 00:15:03.050
And he goes, why do
you want to do that?

00:15:03.050 --> 00:15:07.780
And I said, because I
love to shovel snow.

00:15:07.780 --> 00:15:10.510
And Eric said, come on,
you love to shovel snow.

00:15:10.510 --> 00:15:14.470
And I said, yes, I
grew up in Phoenix

00:15:14.470 --> 00:15:16.520
and I never got to do that.

00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:19.010
So it's a treat for me to
be able to shovel snow.

00:15:19.010 --> 00:15:21.170
So every day at
the end of the day,

00:15:21.170 --> 00:15:24.550
I grabbed that snow shovel
and I shoveled the snow

00:15:24.550 --> 00:15:26.830
around the tent to make
the snow barricade.

00:15:26.830 --> 00:15:29.560
And at the end of
the expedition,

00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:31.060
we made it to the South Pole.

00:15:31.060 --> 00:15:32.110
It was almost two months.

00:15:32.110 --> 00:15:34.529
And Eric said, I'm
just curious, I just

00:15:34.529 --> 00:15:36.070
want to ask everyone
what's your most

00:15:36.070 --> 00:15:37.360
memorable part of the trip.

00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:39.080
And so everybody
was sharing that.

00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:41.710
And I said, what's your
most memorable part

00:15:41.710 --> 00:15:42.610
of the trip, Eric?

00:15:42.610 --> 00:15:46.060
And he said, uh, I think
how much crazy Alison likes

00:15:46.060 --> 00:15:47.679
to shovel snow.

00:15:47.679 --> 00:15:48.970
And I said, are you kidding me?

00:15:48.970 --> 00:15:50.710
I hate to shovel snow.

00:15:50.710 --> 00:15:53.560
I said, I was only doing
that, because I overheard

00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:56.110
you guys talking in your tent
about taking the weight out

00:15:56.110 --> 00:15:56.770
of my sled.

00:15:56.770 --> 00:15:58.516
And he said, oh, you heard that?

00:15:58.516 --> 00:15:59.890
And I was like,
yeah, plus you're

00:15:59.890 --> 00:16:04.120
the crappiest actors with, like,
oh, my back, this is so heavy.

00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:05.920
And for me, it was
this great lesson

00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:10.510
about accepting our weaknesses
and realizing that you're not

00:16:10.510 --> 00:16:13.810
going to overcome every
weakness that you have,

00:16:13.810 --> 00:16:16.822
but you can be creative
and compensate for it.

00:16:16.822 --> 00:16:19.030
So it goes back to that
question about being a woman.

00:16:19.030 --> 00:16:20.590
And we do want to be equal.

00:16:20.590 --> 00:16:22.870
And we do want to
achieve as much.

00:16:22.870 --> 00:16:27.340
And we do like to think that
the playing ground is even.

00:16:27.340 --> 00:16:28.750
But it's not always.

00:16:28.750 --> 00:16:32.260
And for me, I was never going
to overcome the fact that I was

00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:34.810
so much shorter and smaller
and physically weaker than

00:16:34.810 --> 00:16:37.990
my 6'3, 230-pound teammates.

00:16:37.990 --> 00:16:40.300
So it was this light
bulb moment for me

00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:46.480
where I realized that it's our
responsibilities as leaders

00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:49.810
to help people
compensate for weakness

00:16:49.810 --> 00:16:51.801
rather than just hammering
people to overcome

00:16:51.801 --> 00:16:53.050
their weaknesses all the time.

00:16:53.050 --> 00:16:54.940
Because there are
some weaknesses

00:16:54.940 --> 00:16:56.530
that you will never overcome.

00:16:56.530 --> 00:17:00.030
Whether you're a woman
or a man or whatever

00:17:00.030 --> 00:17:02.060
the certain characteristics
that you have,

00:17:02.060 --> 00:17:04.869
there are going to be weaknesses
that you should just accept.

00:17:04.869 --> 00:17:08.500
But it doesn't mean that
you're a weaker performer,

00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:10.730
it just means you have to
be creative and compensate.

00:17:10.730 --> 00:17:14.217
So that's just kind of a
long-winded answer for,

00:17:14.217 --> 00:17:16.550
how do you feel about being
a woman in these situations?

00:17:16.550 --> 00:17:17.425
Are there challenges?

00:17:17.425 --> 00:17:19.180
Is it an advantage
or a disadvantage?

00:17:19.180 --> 00:17:23.680
I just say, be creative,
play to your strengths,

00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:27.339
and realize that your strengths
might not be the same strengths

00:17:27.339 --> 00:17:30.340
that other people have, but
everybody has that sweet spot.

00:17:30.340 --> 00:17:33.430
And if you can be creative
and help someone else find

00:17:33.430 --> 00:17:35.740
their sweet spot,
like Eric did for me,

00:17:35.740 --> 00:17:38.175
you'll often get a higher
level of performance

00:17:38.175 --> 00:17:39.550
out of that person
than you would

00:17:39.550 --> 00:17:42.700
get from them had they been an
on par performer with everybody

00:17:42.700 --> 00:17:45.137
else to begin with.

00:17:45.137 --> 00:17:46.970
ERICA FOX: That makes
me think of situations

00:17:46.970 --> 00:17:48.950
that you talk about a lot
in the book about everyone

00:17:48.950 --> 00:17:50.570
on the team playing
a different role

00:17:50.570 --> 00:17:53.240
and needing to
show up as a leader

00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:56.990
or as a follower at different
parts of the expedition.

00:17:56.990 --> 00:17:59.960
And I'm just curious, when
you think about leadership

00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:05.300
as an attitude or a way
of being with a team as

00:18:05.300 --> 00:18:08.210
opposed to a role, can you talk
a little bit more about that?

00:18:08.210 --> 00:18:10.880
ALISON LEVINE: I think
everybody on a team

00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:12.560
is in a leadership position.

00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:16.880
So leadership is not
about title or tenure

00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:19.850
or how many people report to
you or how big of a budget

00:18:19.850 --> 00:18:20.870
you oversee.

00:18:20.870 --> 00:18:23.270
Leadership's about realizing
that every member of a team

00:18:23.270 --> 00:18:28.370
has a responsibility to help
the team move toward a goal.

00:18:28.370 --> 00:18:30.500
And everybody also
has a responsibility

00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:32.850
to be looking out
for one another.

00:18:32.850 --> 00:18:36.470
If you leave leadership to one
person with a certain title

00:18:36.470 --> 00:18:40.022
or a certain amount of tenure
and that person isn't around,

00:18:40.022 --> 00:18:42.230
what's going to happen if
anything goes wrong, right?

00:18:42.230 --> 00:18:44.900
So on our South Pole
expedition, the one

00:18:44.900 --> 00:18:46.820
I was just talking about,
Eric was brilliant,

00:18:46.820 --> 00:18:50.660
because he had
everybody sort of trade

00:18:50.660 --> 00:18:53.420
off in different
leadership roles every day.

00:18:53.420 --> 00:18:56.490
So every day, somebody
else was out front

00:18:56.490 --> 00:18:58.340
breaking trail and
navigating the route,

00:18:58.340 --> 00:18:59.506
figuring out how to do that.

00:18:59.506 --> 00:19:02.060
Because if you rely on one
person for route finding or one

00:19:02.060 --> 00:19:05.150
person for assessing
avalanche danger or one person

00:19:05.150 --> 00:19:08.145
for cooking the meals,
I mean, whatever it is,

00:19:08.145 --> 00:19:10.657
if that person isn't
around, for whatever reason,

00:19:10.657 --> 00:19:11.990
what are you going to do, right?

00:19:11.990 --> 00:19:14.990
So everybody has to be
able to sort of step

00:19:14.990 --> 00:19:18.530
into a different type of role
when called upon to do so.

00:19:18.530 --> 00:19:20.570
And that's why it's so
important for everybody

00:19:20.570 --> 00:19:23.120
to empower themselves to
think and act like a leader.

00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:24.860
From the second you
walk in the door

00:19:24.860 --> 00:19:27.010
of a building where
you work, right,

00:19:27.010 --> 00:19:29.420
or the second you
start on an expedition,

00:19:29.420 --> 00:19:31.302
everybody has to
realize that they

00:19:31.302 --> 00:19:32.510
are in a leadership position.

00:19:32.510 --> 00:19:35.300
And the other thing
is that as a leader,

00:19:35.300 --> 00:19:38.150
it's very important to
remember that you can never

00:19:38.150 --> 00:19:40.970
expect the people
on your team to be

00:19:40.970 --> 00:19:44.870
willing to endure anything that
you are not willing to endure.

00:19:44.870 --> 00:19:48.734
So you've got to be willing to
get out there in the trenches,

00:19:48.734 --> 00:19:50.900
on the front lines, just
like the rest of the people

00:19:50.900 --> 00:19:53.820
on your team.

00:19:53.820 --> 00:19:55.680
ERICA FOX: So I'm
stuck between wanting

00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:57.180
to ask you more
leadership questions

00:19:57.180 --> 00:20:01.390
and wanting to go into, like,
ooh, tell us about something

00:20:01.390 --> 00:20:02.522
that was really hard.

00:20:02.522 --> 00:20:03.480
So I'll go there first.

00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:06.540
But can you indulge
us in a story

00:20:06.540 --> 00:20:08.970
of just one of the
situations where

00:20:08.970 --> 00:20:10.950
you, as a leader
of the team, knew

00:20:10.950 --> 00:20:13.350
that you had to kind
of endure something

00:20:13.350 --> 00:20:16.850
difficult with your
team and just give us

00:20:16.850 --> 00:20:17.850
a little taste of that--

00:20:17.850 --> 00:20:18.210
ALISON LEVINE: Sure.

00:20:18.210 --> 00:20:20.085
ERICA FOX: --for those
of us who haven't been

00:20:20.085 --> 00:20:21.420
on Everest or the South Pole.

00:20:21.420 --> 00:20:25.920
ALISON LEVINE: Yeah, I would go
back to the 2002 First American

00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:28.590
Women's Everest Expedition
that I referenced

00:20:28.590 --> 00:20:31.090
a little bit earlier, where
we got to within just a couple

00:20:31.090 --> 00:20:33.370
hundred feet from
the summit and we had

00:20:33.370 --> 00:20:34.980
to turn around in bad weather.

00:20:34.980 --> 00:20:38.790
And what made that so
heart-wrenching is, A,

00:20:38.790 --> 00:20:41.040
we were the First American
Women's Everest Expedition,

00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:42.760
so we just wanted to make it.

00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:45.750
But, B, because we had
so much media coverage,

00:20:45.750 --> 00:20:48.300
I felt like we were
under a microscope

00:20:48.300 --> 00:20:50.490
and that we were very
closely scrutinized.

00:20:50.490 --> 00:20:53.040
And before we left
for the expedition,

00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:55.640
we were on the
morning show circuit

00:20:55.640 --> 00:20:58.080
and all the evening news
anchors were interviewing us,

00:20:58.080 --> 00:21:01.260
450 media outlets were
following our climb,

00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:03.720
CNN's doing live updates
from the mountain,

00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:06.900
and then we miss it
by that much, right?

00:21:06.900 --> 00:21:08.880
So then you come back.

00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:11.790
And you have to go back
to all the media outlets

00:21:11.790 --> 00:21:14.670
again, because they're like,
come back after the trip!

00:21:14.670 --> 00:21:16.170
So you go back to
"The Today Show."

00:21:16.170 --> 00:21:17.580
And you walk in.

00:21:17.580 --> 00:21:20.610
And Ann Curry's
like, welcome back!

00:21:20.610 --> 00:21:22.590
Oh.

00:21:22.590 --> 00:21:24.180
So you deal with
that kind of thing,

00:21:24.180 --> 00:21:26.460
where you have to
explain what happened.

00:21:26.460 --> 00:21:31.110
And people don't realize that
it takes several hours to go

00:21:31.110 --> 00:21:33.060
a couple hundred
feet when you're

00:21:33.060 --> 00:21:34.470
climbing up in the Death Zone.

00:21:34.470 --> 00:21:38.850
You could be taking five
breaths for every step

00:21:38.850 --> 00:21:40.210
just to catch your breath again.

00:21:40.210 --> 00:21:42.780
So we turned around a couple
hundred feet from the top.

00:21:42.780 --> 00:21:44.760
And people were like,
why couldn't you

00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:47.409
just run and touch the
tippy top and run back down?

00:21:47.409 --> 00:21:48.450
Like, I don't understand!

00:21:48.450 --> 00:21:51.900
And it's because you're taking
five breaths for every step,

00:21:51.900 --> 00:21:53.640
so it takes a
while to get there.

00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:55.590
And we didn't feel like we
had enough of a decent weather

00:21:55.590 --> 00:21:56.090
window.

00:21:56.090 --> 00:21:59.880
But to come back and have to
just talk about this failure.

00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:01.470
And it was such
a public failure.

00:22:01.470 --> 00:22:06.217
And you go from being this
celebrated team before you go.

00:22:06.217 --> 00:22:07.800
And then you come
back and you're just

00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:11.060
the butt of Jay Leno's
opening monologue joke.

00:22:11.060 --> 00:22:12.170
And how does that feel?

00:22:12.170 --> 00:22:13.540
And yes, that really happened.

00:22:13.540 --> 00:22:17.310
And so it's hard when you have
a big public failure like that,

00:22:17.310 --> 00:22:19.750
where you just you want to
achieve it for yourself,

00:22:19.750 --> 00:22:21.480
for the team, for your sponsor.

00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:23.670
The Ford Motor Company
sponsored our trip.

00:22:23.670 --> 00:22:25.110
And we wanted to
make them proud.

00:22:25.110 --> 00:22:28.290
And we felt like
America was watching.

00:22:28.290 --> 00:22:29.634
And then we didn't do it.

00:22:29.634 --> 00:22:31.050
ERICA FOX: And
it's so interesting

00:22:31.050 --> 00:22:35.982
that it's literally like
stepping on that summit,

00:22:35.982 --> 00:22:37.507
it's off or on, right?

00:22:37.507 --> 00:22:38.340
It's black or white.

00:22:38.340 --> 00:22:40.320
People say you made it
or you didn't make it.

00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:41.195
ALISON LEVINE: Right.

00:22:41.195 --> 00:22:44.550
ERICA FOX: And discounting
all the work, all the time

00:22:44.550 --> 00:22:47.310
you spent on the mountain,
all of the accomplishments

00:22:47.310 --> 00:22:49.920
to get as high up
on that mountain

00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:51.865
as you could is
kind of discounted,

00:22:51.865 --> 00:22:52.740
it seems like, right?

00:22:52.740 --> 00:22:53.698
ALISON LEVINE: Exactly.

00:22:53.698 --> 00:22:57.234
So cut to eight years later,
when I went back and I did

00:22:57.234 --> 00:22:58.150
make it to the summit.

00:22:58.150 --> 00:23:02.010
And I stood up there and
I was like, this is it?

00:23:02.010 --> 00:23:03.510
Because people were
like, how did it

00:23:03.510 --> 00:23:06.245
feel to go back to the
mountain eight years later,

00:23:06.245 --> 00:23:07.620
fight your way
through the storm,

00:23:07.620 --> 00:23:10.510
and stand on the highest
mountain in the world?

00:23:10.510 --> 00:23:13.980
And I was like, uh,
wasn't that big of a deal.

00:23:13.980 --> 00:23:15.800
Because that's when I
realized standing up

00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:17.050
there doesn't change anything.

00:23:17.050 --> 00:23:19.499
It is the journey and what
you learn along the way

00:23:19.499 --> 00:23:21.540
and what you're going to
do with that information

00:23:21.540 --> 00:23:23.940
to be better going forward.

00:23:23.940 --> 00:23:26.370
Anyone that knows a little
something about the history

00:23:26.370 --> 00:23:29.040
of Mount Everest knows the names
Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing

00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:29.770
Norgay, right?

00:23:29.770 --> 00:23:32.250
First guys to ever
summit Mount Everest.

00:23:32.250 --> 00:23:33.720
There were dozens
of climbers who

00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:37.380
tried and failed before those
two made it to the summit.

00:23:37.380 --> 00:23:40.560
But those two had the
benefit of the 411, right?

00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:43.080
The information from all
of those previous climbers.

00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:46.270
And maybe if those other guys
hadn't tried and failed first,

00:23:46.270 --> 00:23:47.850
Sir Edmund Hillary
and Tenzing Norgay

00:23:47.850 --> 00:23:49.420
would never have made
it to the summit.

00:23:49.420 --> 00:23:50.253
You just don't know.

00:23:50.253 --> 00:23:51.930
I mean, my point is
when you're going

00:23:51.930 --> 00:23:54.150
to try really hard
things, when you're

00:23:54.150 --> 00:23:57.030
going to push yourself
outside of your comfort zone,

00:23:57.030 --> 00:23:59.790
you're going to have to give
yourselves and your teams

00:23:59.790 --> 00:24:01.130
the freedom to fail, right?

00:24:01.130 --> 00:24:05.490
Just come back from it
better the next time around.

00:24:05.490 --> 00:24:08.640
ERICA FOX: You also have stories
in the book about backtracking.

00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:10.960
And I tend to think of
that on these trips,

00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:13.590
go up, acclimate, come back.

00:24:13.590 --> 00:24:19.440
And how do you get the team
to go along with you when

00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:22.800
seemingly you're taking them
in the reverse direction

00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:24.120
of progress?

00:24:24.120 --> 00:24:25.590
And I'm interested
on the mountain,

00:24:25.590 --> 00:24:27.570
but I'm also interested
sort of outside

00:24:27.570 --> 00:24:29.580
of the mountain in
a corporate setting

00:24:29.580 --> 00:24:33.074
or in a professional setting
when backtracking is actually

00:24:33.074 --> 00:24:33.990
the right thing to do.

00:24:33.990 --> 00:24:34.440
But it's hard.

00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:35.315
ALISON LEVINE: Right.

00:24:35.315 --> 00:24:35.920
It is so hard.

00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:38.970
So let me paint a little
picture for you of what it's

00:24:38.970 --> 00:24:40.230
like to climb Mount Everest.

00:24:40.230 --> 00:24:44.670
Because the process of the climb
is not at all straightforward.

00:24:44.670 --> 00:24:47.370
You don't just get to base
camp and climb to Camp 1

00:24:47.370 --> 00:24:51.210
and climb to Camp 2 and climb
to Camp 3 and get to Camp 4

00:24:51.210 --> 00:24:52.590
and get to the summit.

00:24:52.590 --> 00:24:54.660
It's going to take
you 10 days of hiking

00:24:54.660 --> 00:24:56.892
just to get yourself
to base camp.

00:24:56.892 --> 00:24:58.350
Once you get to
base camp, you have

00:24:58.350 --> 00:24:59.849
to spend a few days
and nights there

00:24:59.849 --> 00:25:03.004
to get used to the altitude,
because it's over 17,000 feet.

00:25:03.004 --> 00:25:04.920
So then once you've been
there for a few days,

00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:06.630
then you climb up
to the next camp.

00:25:06.630 --> 00:25:08.070
Climb up to Camp 1.

00:25:08.070 --> 00:25:10.140
Spend the night at Camp 1.

00:25:10.140 --> 00:25:14.500
And the next day, you come
back to base camp again.

00:25:14.500 --> 00:25:16.140
Spend a few nights
at base camp again.

00:25:16.140 --> 00:25:17.184
Climb to Camp 1 again.

00:25:17.184 --> 00:25:17.850
Spend the night.

00:25:17.850 --> 00:25:20.940
Then you climb to Camp 2 and you
spend the night up at Camp 2.

00:25:20.940 --> 00:25:24.570
After you spend the night
up at Camp 2, the next day,

00:25:24.570 --> 00:25:27.390
you come back down
to base camp again.

00:25:27.390 --> 00:25:29.850
Spend a few nights
at base camp again.

00:25:29.850 --> 00:25:31.200
Climb to Camp 1 again.

00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:33.060
Next day, climb to Camp 2 again.

00:25:33.060 --> 00:25:36.030
Next day, you're going to
climb all the way up to Camp 3.

00:25:36.030 --> 00:25:39.330
It's almost 24,000 feet.

00:25:39.330 --> 00:25:43.170
And after you spend the night
up at 24,000 feet, the next day,

00:25:43.170 --> 00:25:47.550
you pack up and you come all
the way back down to base camp

00:25:47.550 --> 00:25:48.221
again.

00:25:48.221 --> 00:25:50.220
And the reason you have
to keep coming back down

00:25:50.220 --> 00:25:54.060
is because you have to let your
body get used to the altitude

00:25:54.060 --> 00:25:54.870
very slowly.

00:25:54.870 --> 00:25:57.660
It's this process
called acclimatization.

00:25:57.660 --> 00:25:59.970
And if someone were to
magically drop you off

00:25:59.970 --> 00:26:02.386
on the summit of Mount Everest,
if you could be dropped up

00:26:02.386 --> 00:26:04.830
there by a plane or a helicopter
or something like that,

00:26:04.830 --> 00:26:07.680
you'd be dead in a matter of
minutes just from the altitude.

00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:09.750
So you have to move
up really slowly just

00:26:09.750 --> 00:26:13.120
so your head doesn't pop off
when you get to the very top.

00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:16.810
And I mean, it doesn't
really just pop off.

00:26:16.810 --> 00:26:18.970
But the catch is
that any time you're

00:26:18.970 --> 00:26:21.430
above about 18,000 feet,
which is going to be

00:26:21.430 --> 00:26:23.290
any camp above that base camp--

00:26:23.290 --> 00:26:25.240
base camp's about 17,500.

00:26:25.240 --> 00:26:26.860
Any time you're
above that elevation,

00:26:26.860 --> 00:26:29.320
your body is starting
to deteriorate

00:26:29.320 --> 00:26:31.420
and your muscles
are getting weaker.

00:26:31.420 --> 00:26:34.840
So it's this crazy
catch-22 of you

00:26:34.840 --> 00:26:37.199
want to spend time up high
to get used to the altitude,

00:26:37.199 --> 00:26:38.740
but you have to keep
coming back down

00:26:38.740 --> 00:26:42.040
low just so you can eat,
sleep, hydrate, and regain

00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:42.670
some strength.

00:26:42.670 --> 00:26:44.950
So not only is it
a very physically

00:26:44.950 --> 00:26:50.650
challenging to be going up, back
down, up higher, and back down

00:26:50.650 --> 00:26:53.890
again, but psychologically,
super frustrating as well.

00:26:53.890 --> 00:26:56.569
Because you know you want
to be going this way, right?

00:26:56.569 --> 00:26:58.360
But you're spending a
heck of a lot of time

00:26:58.360 --> 00:27:01.870
climbing in this direction.

00:27:01.870 --> 00:27:04.060
But what you have to realize
is that even though you

00:27:04.060 --> 00:27:07.570
are going completely backwards
where you're like, oh, my god,

00:27:07.570 --> 00:27:10.690
this is not the direction
I want to go, you are still

00:27:10.690 --> 00:27:14.890
making progress, because you're
helping your body acclimatize.

00:27:14.890 --> 00:27:17.530
And for whatever
reason, we always

00:27:17.530 --> 00:27:19.660
tend to think that
progress has to happen

00:27:19.660 --> 00:27:21.930
in one particular direction,
but that's not the case.

00:27:21.930 --> 00:27:25.866
Sometimes you are going to
have to go backwards for a bit

00:27:25.866 --> 00:27:27.990
in order to eventually get
to where you want to be.

00:27:27.990 --> 00:27:32.260
So don't ever look at that
backtracking as losing ground.

00:27:32.260 --> 00:27:37.150
Look at it as an opportunity to
regroup, regain some strength,

00:27:37.150 --> 00:27:39.790
so you're better out of the
gates the next time around.

00:27:39.790 --> 00:27:44.350
And I tell my team all
the time, backing up

00:27:44.350 --> 00:27:48.167
is not the same as backing down.

00:27:48.167 --> 00:27:50.000
OK, that's one of my
best lines, by the way.

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:52.169
So if you're going to
write down anything,

00:27:52.169 --> 00:27:53.210
I would go with that one.

00:27:53.210 --> 00:27:56.640
Backing up is not the
same as backing down.

00:27:56.640 --> 00:28:01.280
ERICA FOX: So speaking of
the camps and the base camp

00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:06.320
and Camp 1 and Camp 2, you
write about emotional obligation

00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:07.100
in your book.

00:28:07.100 --> 00:28:10.617
And I think there was a section
about going tent to tent

00:28:10.617 --> 00:28:11.950
and getting to know people and--

00:28:11.950 --> 00:28:12.200
ALISON LEVINE: Yes.

00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:13.940
ERICA FOX: --creating
some sense--

00:28:13.940 --> 00:28:16.580
or this is how I interpret
it-- creating some sense

00:28:16.580 --> 00:28:18.424
among the other
climbers that there

00:28:18.424 --> 00:28:20.090
was a connection
between the two of you.

00:28:20.090 --> 00:28:22.340
And that they would feel
some emotional connection.

00:28:22.340 --> 00:28:24.232
In the event that
you needed help,

00:28:24.232 --> 00:28:25.940
they may go out of
their way to help you.

00:28:25.940 --> 00:28:27.150
And it was fascinating.

00:28:27.150 --> 00:28:30.020
And I was thinking about
the translation of that

00:28:30.020 --> 00:28:31.250
in the corporate setting.

00:28:31.250 --> 00:28:32.790
And just wondered if you
could talk about that a bit.

00:28:32.790 --> 00:28:34.220
ALISON LEVINE: So
first thing I do

00:28:34.220 --> 00:28:36.636
when I get to base camp on any
mountain, very first thing,

00:28:36.636 --> 00:28:39.830
I walk around, I talk to
every other team that's there.

00:28:39.830 --> 00:28:41.964
And people think it's
because I'm so social.

00:28:41.964 --> 00:28:43.130
But I'm actually not social.

00:28:43.130 --> 00:28:45.800
I'm an extreme,
extreme introvert.

00:28:45.800 --> 00:28:48.860
I love my time alone in my tent.

00:28:48.860 --> 00:28:52.230
But I walk around and I talk to
every other team at base camp

00:28:52.230 --> 00:28:56.240
because if, god forbid,
something should happen

00:28:56.240 --> 00:28:58.925
to someone on one of my teams, I
would need the people around us

00:28:58.925 --> 00:29:02.090
to feel obligated
to help us, right?

00:29:02.090 --> 00:29:04.970
And there's a chapter in the
book that talks about rescues

00:29:04.970 --> 00:29:08.090
on Mount Everest and why some
people are rescued from high

00:29:08.090 --> 00:29:11.204
up on the mountain and others,
unfortunately, are not rescued.

00:29:11.204 --> 00:29:12.620
And it's tragic
that that happens.

00:29:12.620 --> 00:29:13.970
It should never happen.

00:29:13.970 --> 00:29:16.020
But the reality is
that it does happen.

00:29:16.020 --> 00:29:17.870
And there are a lot of factors
that go into whether or not

00:29:17.870 --> 00:29:19.610
somebody can even be
brought down from high up

00:29:19.610 --> 00:29:20.318
on that mountain.

00:29:20.318 --> 00:29:22.671
But one thing that always
works in people's favor

00:29:22.671 --> 00:29:24.920
is if they happen to know
the people walking past them

00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:26.090
at the time.

00:29:26.090 --> 00:29:29.720
Because people who know you
are, of course, much more

00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:32.180
likely to go out of
their way for you,

00:29:32.180 --> 00:29:35.240
potentially take on a large
amount of personal risk for you

00:29:35.240 --> 00:29:37.400
if you have that
relationship in place.

00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:39.140
And I think the mistake
that's often made

00:29:39.140 --> 00:29:41.660
is people think that because
their team's working really

00:29:41.660 --> 00:29:44.644
well together that that's
all they need to worry about.

00:29:44.644 --> 00:29:46.060
But you have to
be very strategic.

00:29:46.060 --> 00:29:49.939
Think about who
outside of your team

00:29:49.939 --> 00:29:51.980
you might need to call on
for help at some point.

00:29:51.980 --> 00:29:54.410
And you want to have those
relationships in place

00:29:54.410 --> 00:29:55.910
before you need the help.

00:29:55.910 --> 00:29:59.150
So put the time and effort
into networking outside

00:29:59.150 --> 00:30:02.000
of your immediate
team here, right,

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:03.920
at Google, because
you just never know

00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:06.764
when it's going to pay off.

00:30:06.764 --> 00:30:08.920
ERICA FOX: Yeah,
it's a great point.

00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:14.160
And we talk a lot in our
programs and communities

00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:17.220
here about the importance
of building relationships

00:30:17.220 --> 00:30:19.650
within teams, within
functions, but then

00:30:19.650 --> 00:30:22.770
people who don't even
work in your department,

00:30:22.770 --> 00:30:24.630
both for in the event
that you need help,

00:30:24.630 --> 00:30:27.440
but also just bringing in
different perspective on that.

00:30:27.440 --> 00:30:28.980
ALISON LEVINE:
That's [INAUDIBLE].

00:30:28.980 --> 00:30:31.271
ERICA FOX: So when you said
you're an extreme introvert

00:30:31.271 --> 00:30:34.440
and you like to be
in your tent, that

00:30:34.440 --> 00:30:38.130
made me think, what
do you do to stay sane

00:30:38.130 --> 00:30:41.910
when you're on these trips
that seem interminable?

00:30:41.910 --> 00:30:44.855
And if there's weather and
if you're going up and down,

00:30:44.855 --> 00:30:46.230
one, what do you
do to stay sane?

00:30:46.230 --> 00:30:48.130
And what do you do for fun?

00:30:48.130 --> 00:30:50.430
ALISON LEVINE: So you
have a lot of tent time

00:30:50.430 --> 00:30:53.130
on these expeditions, whether
it's a bad weather day or just

00:30:53.130 --> 00:30:56.040
an acclimatization day,
right, where you've gone up,

00:30:56.040 --> 00:30:59.334
you come back down, you got
to rest at a lower elevation,

00:30:59.334 --> 00:31:00.750
and you can't bring
a lot of stuff

00:31:00.750 --> 00:31:02.875
with you for entertainment,
because you're carrying

00:31:02.875 --> 00:31:04.380
everything in your backpack.

00:31:04.380 --> 00:31:11.094
So you can't bring a bunch of--

00:31:11.094 --> 00:31:14.320
I mean, you can bring an iPod
or something to listen to music,

00:31:14.320 --> 00:31:16.380
but you can't bring a
ton of books or games

00:31:16.380 --> 00:31:17.530
or anything like that.

00:31:17.530 --> 00:31:21.090
So I actually, when
I'm in my tent, what

00:31:21.090 --> 00:31:24.450
I do to pass the time
and for fun is I make up

00:31:24.450 --> 00:31:27.710
rap songs about my dog.

00:31:27.710 --> 00:31:30.570
And no, I'm not going
to perform one of them

00:31:30.570 --> 00:31:33.470
for you, because I don't
do them for anybody.

00:31:33.470 --> 00:31:34.590
But that is my thing.

00:31:34.590 --> 00:31:36.060
I'm obsessed with my dog.

00:31:36.060 --> 00:31:37.597
I love him so much.

00:31:37.597 --> 00:31:38.180
I have a big--

00:31:38.180 --> 00:31:39.346
ERICA FOX: What kind of dog?

00:31:39.346 --> 00:31:42.390
ALISON LEVINE: --100-pound
black lab named Trooper.

00:31:42.390 --> 00:31:44.280
I dedicated my book to him.

00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:46.740
And my husband too.

00:31:46.740 --> 00:31:47.760
But Trooper's first.

00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:51.040
It's like, to the most amazing,
charismatic, intelligent,

00:31:51.040 --> 00:31:53.920
handsome,
blah-blah-blah-blah, Trooper.

00:31:53.920 --> 00:31:55.740
And to Pat.

00:31:55.740 --> 00:31:57.820
But I make up rap
songs about my dog,

00:31:57.820 --> 00:31:59.070
because I'm obsessed with him.

00:31:59.070 --> 00:32:00.539
And I love him so much.

00:32:00.539 --> 00:32:02.580
I'm sure I have plenty of
dog lovers in the room.

00:32:02.580 --> 00:32:04.000
But dogs are-- they're amazing.

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:05.610
And I think it also--

00:32:05.610 --> 00:32:10.260
because I think dogs can bring
a sense of calm and tranquility,

00:32:10.260 --> 00:32:11.910
it helps me to think about him.

00:32:11.910 --> 00:32:14.397
But I make up rap
songs about him.

00:32:14.397 --> 00:32:16.230
And I just sing them
to him when I get home,

00:32:16.230 --> 00:32:19.560
not to anybody else.

00:32:19.560 --> 00:32:21.570
ERICA FOX: Awesome.

00:32:21.570 --> 00:32:23.370
One other thing
that you mentioned

00:32:23.370 --> 00:32:28.248
is the concept of VUCA,
volatile, uncertain--

00:32:28.248 --> 00:32:29.206
ALISON LEVINE: Complex.

00:32:29.206 --> 00:32:31.760
ERICA FOX: --complex
and ambiguous.

00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:35.790
And that more and more, the
environments that we're in

00:32:35.790 --> 00:32:38.610
are these VUCA environments,
particularly for the industry

00:32:38.610 --> 00:32:39.390
that we work in.

00:32:39.390 --> 00:32:41.970
And many of the products
that we're launching

00:32:41.970 --> 00:32:44.920
and the markets that we're
in have never existed before.

00:32:44.920 --> 00:32:50.280
So I'm curious how you think
about preparation and planning

00:32:50.280 --> 00:32:55.620
and anticipating events
and this VUCA environment.

00:32:55.620 --> 00:32:59.880
Because some might argue that
in a uncertain and volatile

00:32:59.880 --> 00:33:01.590
environment, you
need to actually

00:33:01.590 --> 00:33:03.720
be very creative and
innovative about how you're

00:33:03.720 --> 00:33:06.660
going to respond, not always
thinking you have the plan,

00:33:06.660 --> 00:33:08.040
because the plan might not work.

00:33:08.040 --> 00:33:08.310
ALISON LEVINE: Exactly.

00:33:08.310 --> 00:33:09.851
ERICA FOX: How do
you reconcile this?

00:33:09.851 --> 00:33:12.630
ALISON LEVINE: So
obviously, when

00:33:12.630 --> 00:33:15.510
you're getting ready for
a big expedition or just

00:33:15.510 --> 00:33:17.892
in the business world,
planning's super important.

00:33:17.892 --> 00:33:18.600
You have to plan.

00:33:18.600 --> 00:33:20.730
It helps keep you organized.

00:33:20.730 --> 00:33:23.430
It helps keep you on track.

00:33:23.430 --> 00:33:25.170
But what you have to
realize is that when

00:33:25.170 --> 00:33:27.336
you are in environments
that are constantly shifting

00:33:27.336 --> 00:33:30.900
and changing, and when you
have these elements that

00:33:30.900 --> 00:33:34.800
are completely outside
of your control,

00:33:34.800 --> 00:33:38.390
your plan might be outdated
as soon as it's finished.

00:33:38.390 --> 00:33:40.530
Or whether you came
out with it last year,

00:33:40.530 --> 00:33:43.260
last month, last week,
even that morning,

00:33:43.260 --> 00:33:44.920
your plan is already
outdated, right?

00:33:44.920 --> 00:33:46.920
As soon as it's finished,
your plan is outdated.

00:33:46.920 --> 00:33:49.566
So what you have to do in
these types of environments is,

00:33:49.566 --> 00:33:50.940
while it's good
to plan, you have

00:33:50.940 --> 00:33:54.060
to be much more focused
on executing based

00:33:54.060 --> 00:33:58.159
on what is going on at the time,
rather than being hell-bent

00:33:58.159 --> 00:33:59.200
on sticking to your plan.

00:33:59.200 --> 00:33:59.836
Well, this is the plan.

00:33:59.836 --> 00:34:00.810
This is what we put together.

00:34:00.810 --> 00:34:02.030
This is what we agreed upon.

00:34:02.030 --> 00:34:03.005
We got to follow it.

00:34:03.005 --> 00:34:04.260
Forget that.

00:34:04.260 --> 00:34:07.020
You have to be much more
focused on executing

00:34:07.020 --> 00:34:12.940
based on the situation,
not based on the plan.

00:34:12.940 --> 00:34:14.800
ERICA FOX: And is
there a hierarchy

00:34:14.800 --> 00:34:19.719
or a prioritization of needs,
I guess, in that moment, right?

00:34:19.719 --> 00:34:21.909
I'm thinking,
obviously, preserving

00:34:21.909 --> 00:34:23.469
life is probably the first one.

00:34:23.469 --> 00:34:24.552
ALISON LEVINE: Good point.

00:34:24.552 --> 00:34:27.444
ERICA FOX: But are
there other parameters

00:34:27.444 --> 00:34:28.360
that you keep in mind?

00:34:28.360 --> 00:34:29.985
If you're going to
have to shift and be

00:34:29.985 --> 00:34:32.259
present in the situation,
what are the considerations

00:34:32.259 --> 00:34:32.980
that you--

00:34:32.980 --> 00:34:35.355
ALISON LEVINE: So I'm glad
you mentioned preserving life,

00:34:35.355 --> 00:34:39.489
because that is the number one
goal of any expedition, come

00:34:39.489 --> 00:34:40.360
back alive.

00:34:40.360 --> 00:34:43.239
The goal is never the
summit of the mountain

00:34:43.239 --> 00:34:45.520
or reaching the North
Pole or the South Pole.

00:34:45.520 --> 00:34:47.170
Number one goal,
come back alive.

00:34:47.170 --> 00:34:49.570
Number two, come back with
all your fingers and toes.

00:34:49.570 --> 00:34:51.760
Number three, come
back as friends

00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:53.750
with the people on your team.

00:34:53.750 --> 00:34:57.250
What you have to remember
is that the summit, not only

00:34:57.250 --> 00:35:02.590
is it not the goal, the summit
is only the halfway point.

00:35:02.590 --> 00:35:04.540
So what you have to
think about is not just

00:35:04.540 --> 00:35:08.377
do I have enough in me, enough
mental and physical energy

00:35:08.377 --> 00:35:10.585
to get myself to the summit,
you have to be thinking,

00:35:10.585 --> 00:35:12.376
do I have enough mental
and physical energy

00:35:12.376 --> 00:35:15.940
to get myself to the summit
and get myself back down?

00:35:15.940 --> 00:35:20.230
So most of the deaths
that occur on the mountain

00:35:20.230 --> 00:35:23.380
occur shortly after people
have reached the summit,

00:35:23.380 --> 00:35:26.479
because they use everything
they've got left in them to get

00:35:26.479 --> 00:35:29.020
themselves to the top and they
don't have enough left in them

00:35:29.020 --> 00:35:30.310
to get themselves back down.

00:35:30.310 --> 00:35:34.180
So you have to know yourself
really well and think about

00:35:34.180 --> 00:35:36.460
not only do I have enough
left to get me there,

00:35:36.460 --> 00:35:39.100
but do I have enough left
to get me back down safely?

00:35:39.100 --> 00:35:41.520
So just always keeping
in mind, the summit

00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:45.160
is the halfway
point only, right?

00:35:45.160 --> 00:35:48.400
You got to be able to
get yourself back down.

00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:51.730
ERICA FOX: And once
you're back down,

00:35:51.730 --> 00:35:55.380
did you have any sort of
routine or ritual that was--

00:35:55.380 --> 00:35:58.750
I mean, maybe postmortem
on the formal side of it,

00:35:58.750 --> 00:36:01.000
but even just personal,
like, a period

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:03.070
of reflection or depression?

00:36:03.070 --> 00:36:05.000
Or what happens afterwards?

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:06.707
I mean, you've had
this amazing goal.

00:36:06.707 --> 00:36:08.290
You've gone through
all these ordeals.

00:36:08.290 --> 00:36:09.450
And then it's done.

00:36:09.450 --> 00:36:09.950
What--

00:36:09.950 --> 00:36:10.870
ALISON LEVINE: It is done.

00:36:10.870 --> 00:36:12.203
ERICA FOX: --happens after that?

00:36:12.203 --> 00:36:14.710
ALISON LEVINE: So
that's why I really

00:36:14.710 --> 00:36:18.040
try never to emphasize
the summit of a mountain.

00:36:18.040 --> 00:36:20.627
Because if you just
emphasize summits,

00:36:20.627 --> 00:36:22.210
you're just going
to get there or not.

00:36:22.210 --> 00:36:23.020
And then it's over.

00:36:23.020 --> 00:36:25.720
And you think all that blood,
sweat, and tears for what,

00:36:25.720 --> 00:36:26.220
right?

00:36:26.220 --> 00:36:31.150
So it does go back to, for me,
post-expedition, I think about,

00:36:31.150 --> 00:36:33.820
what did I learn along the
way that's going to help

00:36:33.820 --> 00:36:36.286
me be better going forward?

00:36:36.286 --> 00:36:37.660
But the other
thing I think about

00:36:37.660 --> 00:36:43.690
is I think about the people
that paved the way before me

00:36:43.690 --> 00:36:46.120
and who was it that had
the guts and the courage

00:36:46.120 --> 00:36:49.570
to get out here and
do this before I ever

00:36:49.570 --> 00:36:50.770
came to this mountain.

00:36:50.770 --> 00:36:54.370
And I'm actually making
a documentary right now

00:36:54.370 --> 00:36:58.270
about the first Nepali woman
to ever climb Mount Everest.

00:36:58.270 --> 00:36:59.890
Her name was Pasang
Lhamu Sherpa.

00:36:59.890 --> 00:37:03.040
And when she first climbed--
because I think about her all

00:37:03.040 --> 00:37:04.270
the time on all these climbs.

00:37:04.270 --> 00:37:06.220
She was really an
inspiration to me.

00:37:06.220 --> 00:37:09.370
But she grew up in Nepal.

00:37:09.370 --> 00:37:09.880
Dirt poor.

00:37:09.880 --> 00:37:10.420
Couldn't read.

00:37:10.420 --> 00:37:11.045
Couldn't write.

00:37:11.045 --> 00:37:12.644
No education.

00:37:12.644 --> 00:37:14.560
And she had this dream
to climb Mount Everest.

00:37:14.560 --> 00:37:16.930
But she wasn't allowed to,
because she was a Sherpa woman.

00:37:16.930 --> 00:37:19.050
And they didn't let Sherpa
women climb Mount Everest.

00:37:19.050 --> 00:37:19.620
Sherpanis.

00:37:19.620 --> 00:37:20.630
That's what they call them.

00:37:20.630 --> 00:37:21.880
They weren't allowed to climb.

00:37:21.880 --> 00:37:23.170
Only the men could climb.

00:37:23.170 --> 00:37:26.410
And she basically said,
that's kind of like bullshit.

00:37:26.410 --> 00:37:29.590
Women should be able to
climb this mountain too.

00:37:29.590 --> 00:37:36.040
So the Nepali government let
women from 22 other countries

00:37:36.040 --> 00:37:38.530
come and climb Everest, but
wouldn't let the local women

00:37:38.530 --> 00:37:39.220
climb.

00:37:39.220 --> 00:37:43.990
So she had the courage to
fight the government of Nepal

00:37:43.990 --> 00:37:46.810
to allow women access to
Everest and allow women

00:37:46.810 --> 00:37:47.620
the right to climb.

00:37:47.620 --> 00:37:49.969
And she tried three
times unsuccessfully

00:37:49.969 --> 00:37:51.010
to make it to the summit.

00:37:51.010 --> 00:37:54.604
One time she got as far as
the high camp at 26,000 feet

00:37:54.604 --> 00:37:56.770
and was told she wasn't
allowed to go to the summit,

00:37:56.770 --> 00:37:58.960
because they didn't want
a Sherpa woman touching

00:37:58.960 --> 00:37:59.500
the summit.

00:37:59.500 --> 00:38:02.260
That would just ruin the
whole mountain forever, right?

00:38:02.260 --> 00:38:03.940
So she wasn't
permitted to go on.

00:38:03.940 --> 00:38:06.280
And that was a crusher for her.

00:38:06.280 --> 00:38:09.100
She finally made it to the
summit on her fourth attempt

00:38:09.100 --> 00:38:11.110
in 1993.

00:38:11.110 --> 00:38:14.110
But she died on the descent.

00:38:14.110 --> 00:38:17.140
She left three young
children behind.

00:38:17.140 --> 00:38:21.070
And I think that she
was just so determined

00:38:21.070 --> 00:38:23.867
to make it to the summit to
represent the women of Nepal.

00:38:23.867 --> 00:38:25.450
And it was in the
early '90s and there

00:38:25.450 --> 00:38:27.520
was the people's
movement of Nepal

00:38:27.520 --> 00:38:29.380
and this strong
sense of nationalism

00:38:29.380 --> 00:38:32.410
and it just became
this goal that became

00:38:32.410 --> 00:38:34.180
much bigger than herself.

00:38:34.180 --> 00:38:35.830
And she was so
determined to get there.

00:38:35.830 --> 00:38:37.360
And she didn't
make it back down.

00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:41.290
And after every climb, I
think about people like Pasang

00:38:41.290 --> 00:38:43.450
and other people like her
that were brave enough

00:38:43.450 --> 00:38:47.890
to go out there and do it
first and to fight the system.

00:38:47.890 --> 00:38:50.830
Because for her, it wasn't
just about climbing a mountain,

00:38:50.830 --> 00:38:53.800
you know, it was about women's
rights and changing things

00:38:53.800 --> 00:38:55.150
in that country.

00:38:55.150 --> 00:38:56.470
And it was about equality.

00:38:56.470 --> 00:38:58.810
And it was also about
just showing people

00:38:58.810 --> 00:39:00.985
that no matter who you
are or where you came from

00:39:00.985 --> 00:39:05.050
or your level of education
or your demographic, whatever

00:39:05.050 --> 00:39:08.380
your background is, if you
have a dream, then frickin'

00:39:08.380 --> 00:39:09.890
go out there and go for it.

00:39:09.890 --> 00:39:12.649
And so I'm so inspired by
people like her that did this.

00:39:12.649 --> 00:39:14.940
So that's why I'm working on
this documentary now. now.

00:39:14.940 --> 00:39:16.280
It's called "The Glass Ceiling."

00:39:16.280 --> 00:39:18.660
So we have a little
highlight reel online.

00:39:18.660 --> 00:39:21.387
If you want to check it out,
it's theglassceilingmovie.com.

00:39:21.387 --> 00:39:22.720
You can learn more about Pasang.

00:39:22.720 --> 00:39:25.800
But I just feel like when
I'm done with a climb,

00:39:25.800 --> 00:39:29.250
I stop and I think about the
people that had the courage

00:39:29.250 --> 00:39:32.850
to go before me because
I feel like I owe them

00:39:32.850 --> 00:39:35.940
a lot of gratitude and
a lot of appreciation.

00:39:35.940 --> 00:39:38.100
So that's what I think
about on these trips,

00:39:38.100 --> 00:39:40.370
typically, are the
people that did it first,

00:39:40.370 --> 00:39:42.990
the people that really
had the courage to get out

00:39:42.990 --> 00:39:45.630
there long before I did.

00:39:45.630 --> 00:39:47.880
ERICA FOX: When are you
anticipating that'll come out?

00:39:47.880 --> 00:39:48.270
ALISON LEVINE: I don't know.

00:39:48.270 --> 00:39:50.670
We We're going to be
doing a crowdfunding

00:39:50.670 --> 00:39:52.020
campaign in a couple of months.

00:39:52.020 --> 00:39:54.780
So probably if you're
connected to me in some way,

00:39:54.780 --> 00:39:55.530
you'll get a little
email about that.

00:39:55.530 --> 00:39:56.340
ERICA FOX:
Theglassceilingmovie.com

00:39:56.340 --> 00:39:57.810
ALISON LEVINE:
Theglassceilingmovie.com.

00:39:57.810 --> 00:40:00.390
Yeah, so we're going to do an
Indiegogo campaign, because we

00:40:00.390 --> 00:40:03.785
need to raise the funds for
all the post-production costs

00:40:03.785 --> 00:40:04.410
and everything.

00:40:04.410 --> 00:40:06.122
So hopefully, we'll
have it finished

00:40:06.122 --> 00:40:07.080
by the end of the year.

00:40:07.080 --> 00:40:09.150
That's what I'm hoping.

00:40:09.150 --> 00:40:11.940
ERICA FOX: So what's
different for you now?

00:40:11.940 --> 00:40:13.110
Or how are you different?

00:40:13.110 --> 00:40:17.250
If you kind of reflect
back to those days when

00:40:17.250 --> 00:40:19.920
you were starting out and
using your frequent flyer

00:40:19.920 --> 00:40:23.280
miles to go to Mount Kilimanjaro
and kind of bootstrapping

00:40:23.280 --> 00:40:28.740
a lot of these expeditions,
what's different about you now?

00:40:28.740 --> 00:40:32.490
ALISON LEVINE: What's really
different is, I think,

00:40:32.490 --> 00:40:34.950
my level of failure tolerance.

00:40:34.950 --> 00:40:37.590
Because I used to
think that in order

00:40:37.590 --> 00:40:40.170
to get a sponsor
for an expedition

00:40:40.170 --> 00:40:43.590
or to get whatever media
coverage that your team needs

00:40:43.590 --> 00:40:45.750
to get sponsored for
the next expedition,

00:40:45.750 --> 00:40:49.612
you have to be the best,
fastest, strongest climber,

00:40:49.612 --> 00:40:51.570
and you have to get to
the top of the mountain.

00:40:51.570 --> 00:40:58.952
And I really learned a
sense of failure tolerance.

00:40:58.952 --> 00:41:00.660
And I think, in general,
we're not really

00:41:00.660 --> 00:41:03.450
a very failure tolerant society,
which is really too bad.

00:41:03.450 --> 00:41:05.200
Because a lack of
failure tolerance

00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:08.520
is what stifles
progress and innovation

00:41:08.520 --> 00:41:11.002
and prevents people from
taking risks, right?

00:41:11.002 --> 00:41:12.960
So you've got to give
yourselves and your teams

00:41:12.960 --> 00:41:13.520
a freedom to fail.

00:41:13.520 --> 00:41:15.270
When you're going to
try really hard stuff

00:41:15.270 --> 00:41:18.690
that's a huge stretch that
feels like it's completely

00:41:18.690 --> 00:41:21.366
out of your comfort
zone, give yourselves

00:41:21.366 --> 00:41:22.240
that freedom to fail.

00:41:22.240 --> 00:41:24.660
Just come back from it
better the next time around.

00:41:24.660 --> 00:41:26.700
And sometimes you look
at these people that

00:41:26.700 --> 00:41:31.590
seem like they're these
really high achievers, that

00:41:31.590 --> 00:41:35.511
seem perfect and they
achieve everything

00:41:35.511 --> 00:41:36.510
they set out to achieve.

00:41:36.510 --> 00:41:39.720
But just remember that a lot of
the times, people only achieve

00:41:39.720 --> 00:41:42.690
something, because somebody
else got out there first

00:41:42.690 --> 00:41:43.500
and paved the way.

00:41:43.500 --> 00:41:44.916
And sometimes it's
the people that

00:41:44.916 --> 00:41:47.490
get out there first that have
stumbled and fallen and been

00:41:47.490 --> 00:41:50.790
bruised and bloodied
along the way, right?

00:41:50.790 --> 00:41:53.580
And so give yourselves
that freedom to fail.

00:41:53.580 --> 00:41:57.095
The other thing that
I learned is that--

00:41:57.095 --> 00:41:59.790
and this is a super important
lesson for me to remember

00:41:59.790 --> 00:42:02.670
and I think, for
everyone to remember--

00:42:02.670 --> 00:42:07.230
you do not have to be the best,
fastest, strongest climber

00:42:07.230 --> 00:42:09.180
to get to the top of a mountain.

00:42:09.180 --> 00:42:13.650
You just have to be absolutely
relentless about putting

00:42:13.650 --> 00:42:15.840
one foot in front of the other.

00:42:15.840 --> 00:42:17.190
That's really all it was.

00:42:17.190 --> 00:42:19.710
Because in 2002 when
I didn't make it

00:42:19.710 --> 00:42:21.960
to the summit in a storm,
I think about that.

00:42:21.960 --> 00:42:24.990
And in 2010 in a
similar situation,

00:42:24.990 --> 00:42:27.660
we had bad weather again
in 2010 when I went back

00:42:27.660 --> 00:42:30.810
eight years later, but I was
able to push through the storm.

00:42:30.810 --> 00:42:32.760
And that's because I
knew a heck of a lot more

00:42:32.760 --> 00:42:37.150
about my pain threshold,
about my risk tolerance.

00:42:37.150 --> 00:42:39.855
I knew what it felt like to
get the living snot kicked out

00:42:39.855 --> 00:42:41.730
of me high up on that
summit ridge in a storm

00:42:41.730 --> 00:42:43.854
and I wasn't afraid of that
the second time around.

00:42:43.854 --> 00:42:48.540
And so I think I've learned
to learn from my failures.

00:42:48.540 --> 00:42:50.305
And I've learned
also that it's just

00:42:50.305 --> 00:42:52.180
about putting one foot
in front of the other.

00:42:52.180 --> 00:42:54.263
You don't have to be the
best, fastest, strongest.

00:42:54.263 --> 00:42:56.117
Just be relentless.

00:42:56.117 --> 00:42:58.200
ERICA FOX: That sounds
terrifying and exhilarating

00:42:58.200 --> 00:43:00.180
at the same time.

00:43:00.180 --> 00:43:03.667
OK, I'm just going to see
if anyone has questions.

00:43:03.667 --> 00:43:06.552
ALISON LEVINE:
Ah, good question.

00:43:06.552 --> 00:43:08.010
ERICA FOX: So let
me just repeat it

00:43:08.010 --> 00:43:09.343
for the folks on the livestream.

00:43:09.343 --> 00:43:12.567
A question about training
schedule and routine

00:43:12.567 --> 00:43:13.400
throughout the year.

00:43:13.400 --> 00:43:14.233
ALISON LEVINE: Yeah.

00:43:14.233 --> 00:43:16.192
So I wrote a little bit
about this in the book.

00:43:16.192 --> 00:43:18.150
And it's one of the more
controversial sections

00:43:18.150 --> 00:43:19.566
in the book because
people call me

00:43:19.566 --> 00:43:21.090
out on this section
all the time,

00:43:21.090 --> 00:43:24.300
because I talk about
sleep deprivation.

00:43:24.300 --> 00:43:26.306
ERICA FOX: We know a
fair bit about that here.

00:43:26.306 --> 00:43:27.180
ALISON LEVINE: Right?

00:43:27.180 --> 00:43:32.969
So the only way to really train
properly for a big expedition

00:43:32.969 --> 00:43:34.260
is to get out to the mountains.

00:43:34.260 --> 00:43:36.600
No amount of running,
cycling, swimming

00:43:36.600 --> 00:43:39.240
is going to prepare
you for a big climb.

00:43:39.240 --> 00:43:41.010
That's good for your
cardiovascular health

00:43:41.010 --> 00:43:43.180
and your overall health, so
you should continue to do that.

00:43:43.180 --> 00:43:44.850
But if you're going
to go to a big peak,

00:43:44.850 --> 00:43:46.349
you got to get out
to the mountains.

00:43:46.349 --> 00:43:48.537
So for me, I would drive
up to Mount Shasta.

00:43:48.537 --> 00:43:50.370
Probably some of you
have been there before.

00:43:50.370 --> 00:43:52.380
But it's just south
of the Oregon border.

00:43:52.380 --> 00:43:55.740
So it would take me about six
hours to drive to Mount Shasta.

00:43:55.740 --> 00:43:58.200
And I would start from the
parking lot at 11 o'clock

00:43:58.200 --> 00:43:59.509
at night or midnight.

00:43:59.509 --> 00:44:01.050
And I would put on
a heavy pack and I

00:44:01.050 --> 00:44:03.180
would climb from the
base of Mount Shasta

00:44:03.180 --> 00:44:06.210
to the summit, which is
just over 14,000 feet,

00:44:06.210 --> 00:44:08.610
and back down in one
push with a heavy pack.

00:44:08.610 --> 00:44:10.984
I would climb through the night.

00:44:10.984 --> 00:44:13.650
And the reason I wanted to climb
through the night with no sleep

00:44:13.650 --> 00:44:17.190
is because I wanted to
practice sleep deprivation.

00:44:17.190 --> 00:44:20.670
Because in addition to
conditioning myself physically

00:44:20.670 --> 00:44:23.130
with a heavy pack and
crampons and an ice axe

00:44:23.130 --> 00:44:26.794
and walking up a
steep slope, I wanted

00:44:26.794 --> 00:44:28.710
to get my body used to
that sleep deprivation.

00:44:28.710 --> 00:44:30.260
Because on these
big expeditions,

00:44:30.260 --> 00:44:32.430
sometimes you're going
to climb for 18, 20,

00:44:32.430 --> 00:44:34.710
maybe 24 or more hours.

00:44:34.710 --> 00:44:38.310
And I found that people get
really stressed out about that.

00:44:38.310 --> 00:44:38.814
Oh, my god.

00:44:38.814 --> 00:44:40.230
Summit day's going
to be 20 hours?

00:44:40.230 --> 00:44:41.313
How am I going to do that?

00:44:41.313 --> 00:44:44.170
So I like to practice
sleep deprivation

00:44:44.170 --> 00:44:46.260
so that I know how
my body performs

00:44:46.260 --> 00:44:48.570
when I am incredibly
sleep deprived

00:44:48.570 --> 00:44:49.952
and I'm familiar with it.

00:44:49.952 --> 00:44:51.660
So it doesn't stress
me out when I think,

00:44:51.660 --> 00:44:54.180
oh, yeah, 20 hours
climbing with no sleep.

00:44:54.180 --> 00:44:54.810
24 hours.

00:44:54.810 --> 00:44:55.520
I can do that.

00:44:55.520 --> 00:44:58.020
I practice that all the time.

00:44:58.020 --> 00:45:01.500
Is it good for you to go
without sleep a bunch of times?

00:45:01.500 --> 00:45:04.620
No, it's terrible for you.

00:45:04.620 --> 00:45:10.400
But I didn't write a book
about how to live to be 100.

00:45:10.400 --> 00:45:12.990
I wrote a book about how to get
through the toughest of times

00:45:12.990 --> 00:45:14.170
when you absolutely have to.

00:45:14.170 --> 00:45:17.580
So for me, part of that is
just sleep deprivation training

00:45:17.580 --> 00:45:20.880
on top of the physical
training for these expeditions.

00:45:20.880 --> 00:45:22.920
ERICA FOX: Are you
climbing now still?

00:45:22.920 --> 00:45:25.770
ALISON LEVINE: I just did
a climb this past November.

00:45:25.770 --> 00:45:28.064
I went back to Nepal
to this remote area

00:45:28.064 --> 00:45:29.230
called the Rolwaling Valley.

00:45:29.230 --> 00:45:30.688
I went with two
girlfriends of mine

00:45:30.688 --> 00:45:31.980
that live in the French Alps.

00:45:31.980 --> 00:45:33.780
And we spent a couple
of weeks over there.

00:45:33.780 --> 00:45:37.005
We did the first ascent of
this peak called Khang Karpo.

00:45:37.005 --> 00:45:40.030
It's a 22,000-foot peak over
in the Rolwaling Valley.

00:45:40.030 --> 00:45:41.780
We were the first
people to ever climb it.

00:45:41.780 --> 00:45:44.224
So it was incredibly
challenging, but also really

00:45:44.224 --> 00:45:46.140
rewarding and a lot of
fun to go to a mountain

00:45:46.140 --> 00:45:48.264
that nobody had ever climbed
before because there's

00:45:48.264 --> 00:45:49.950
no beta at all on the peak.

00:45:49.950 --> 00:45:51.950
You kind of have to figure
things out as you go.

00:45:51.950 --> 00:45:54.540
And we went with an amazing team
of Sherpas that were actually

00:45:54.540 --> 00:45:55.660
from that village.

00:45:55.660 --> 00:45:57.780
So they knew their way
around there really well.

00:45:57.780 --> 00:45:59.400
And they were incredible.

00:45:59.400 --> 00:46:00.550
And it was fun.

00:46:00.550 --> 00:46:02.460
It was the second first
ascent I had done.

00:46:02.460 --> 00:46:04.920
I did one last year, the
first ascent of Hall Peak

00:46:04.920 --> 00:46:06.780
in Antarctica.

00:46:06.780 --> 00:46:08.940
The seven summits or the
Adventure Grand Slam.

00:46:08.940 --> 00:46:14.700
So it wasn't really like
I set out to do that.

00:46:14.700 --> 00:46:17.880
Because you don't get anything
when you complete the Grand

00:46:17.880 --> 00:46:18.540
Slam.

00:46:18.540 --> 00:46:20.498
You don't even get a free
breakfast at Denny's.

00:46:20.498 --> 00:46:23.085
You get nothing.

00:46:23.085 --> 00:46:26.100
I had to buy my own
Grand Slam breakfast.

00:46:26.100 --> 00:46:28.542
But for whatever reason, I
started climbing these peaks.

00:46:28.542 --> 00:46:31.000
And I would go to a mountain
and I would meet people there.

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:32.770
And then they would invite
me on another expedition.

00:46:32.770 --> 00:46:35.019
So then I'd end up on another
one of the seven summits

00:46:35.019 --> 00:46:37.080
and then another one
of the seven summits.

00:46:37.080 --> 00:46:39.030
And before I knew
it, I had climbed

00:46:39.030 --> 00:46:40.320
six of the seven summits.

00:46:40.320 --> 00:46:42.840
And I thought, oh,
well, I'll never

00:46:42.840 --> 00:46:45.870
do the seven summits, because
how could I go to Everest?

00:46:45.870 --> 00:46:47.100
I couldn't afford that.

00:46:47.100 --> 00:46:48.690
And I don't have the
time off of work.

00:46:48.690 --> 00:46:50.273
And I have all this
student loan debt.

00:46:50.273 --> 00:46:53.490
And that would never be
something I could do.

00:46:53.490 --> 00:46:57.460
Well, sure enough, where
there's a will, there's a way.

00:46:57.460 --> 00:47:00.270
And I ended up actually
getting an invitation

00:47:00.270 --> 00:47:02.710
to join the First American
Women's Everest Expedition

00:47:02.710 --> 00:47:03.960
and serve as the team captain.

00:47:03.960 --> 00:47:07.050
And we got Ford as a
sponsor, so that covered

00:47:07.050 --> 00:47:09.780
the financial end of it.

00:47:09.780 --> 00:47:12.480
And then this was
shortly after 9/11.

00:47:12.480 --> 00:47:14.750
And I had this new
job at Goldman Sachs.

00:47:14.750 --> 00:47:17.040
I was a new associate there
right out of grad school.

00:47:17.040 --> 00:47:19.770
And I was a very junior
level person there.

00:47:19.770 --> 00:47:22.530
But it was after 9/11 and all
the investment banking firms

00:47:22.530 --> 00:47:23.770
were laying people off.

00:47:23.770 --> 00:47:26.430
And so I thought, well,
maybe I could take

00:47:26.430 --> 00:47:27.930
an unpaid leave of absence.

00:47:27.930 --> 00:47:29.565
And the timing was
perfect after 9/11.

00:47:29.565 --> 00:47:31.919
So I was like, could I
get two months unpaid?

00:47:31.919 --> 00:47:33.210
And they were like, two months?

00:47:33.210 --> 00:47:34.050
Sure thing.

00:47:34.050 --> 00:47:35.480
Take six months.

00:47:35.480 --> 00:47:37.590
Take the whole
department with you.

00:47:37.590 --> 00:47:39.870
So it was just
good timing that I

00:47:39.870 --> 00:47:41.300
was able to take the time off.

00:47:41.300 --> 00:47:43.380
But then, of course, we
didn't make it in 2002.

00:47:43.380 --> 00:47:44.880
So it wasn't until
eight years later

00:47:44.880 --> 00:47:46.770
where I actually
completed the Grand Slam.

00:47:46.770 --> 00:47:50.290
But it wasn't like I set
out to do that as a goal,

00:47:50.290 --> 00:47:53.070
it just kind of
ended up happening,

00:47:53.070 --> 00:47:54.540
where I didn't
even know there was

00:47:54.540 --> 00:47:56.206
such a thing as the
Adventure Grand Slam

00:47:56.206 --> 00:47:58.590
until I got to Everest
base camp in 2010

00:47:58.590 --> 00:48:01.740
and was talking with some other
people about my experiences

00:48:01.740 --> 00:48:02.700
on other mountains.

00:48:02.700 --> 00:48:05.381
And I was talking about how much
I liked my polar expeditions as

00:48:05.381 --> 00:48:05.880
well.

00:48:05.880 --> 00:48:08.250
And this guy said, oh, you've
been to the North and South

00:48:08.250 --> 00:48:08.749
Pole?

00:48:08.749 --> 00:48:10.440
If you summit Everest,
you know, that's

00:48:10.440 --> 00:48:11.550
the Adventure Grand Slam.

00:48:11.550 --> 00:48:15.030
And I said, I don't even
know what that is, but great.

00:48:15.030 --> 00:48:17.320
So that's how I
ended up doing it.

00:48:17.320 --> 00:48:19.740
It wasn't really
anything I set out

00:48:19.740 --> 00:48:21.810
to do as a goal ahead of time.

00:48:21.810 --> 00:48:23.610
ERICA FOX: OK,
how, if at all, did

00:48:23.610 --> 00:48:25.620
the danger of
climbing Mount Everest

00:48:25.620 --> 00:48:29.200
factor into your
attempts at the mountain?

00:48:29.200 --> 00:48:31.710
ALISON LEVINE: So you're always
aware when you're in these

00:48:31.710 --> 00:48:35.269
remote extreme environments
where you cannot control things

00:48:35.269 --> 00:48:37.560
around you and there are all
these elements that affect

00:48:37.560 --> 00:48:37.980
your climb.

00:48:37.980 --> 00:48:40.080
So the weather is probably
the most obvious thing

00:48:40.080 --> 00:48:41.220
that people think
about, the weather,

00:48:41.220 --> 00:48:42.515
but there are other things too.

00:48:42.515 --> 00:48:44.640
Your health, the health of
the team, the conditions

00:48:44.640 --> 00:48:47.130
of the route, the conditions
of your gear, all these things

00:48:47.130 --> 00:48:49.890
can change and you
can't control any of it.

00:48:49.890 --> 00:48:54.420
So Mount Everest really bad
place for control freaks.

00:48:54.420 --> 00:48:58.020
So it goes back
to, first of all,

00:48:58.020 --> 00:49:01.020
being able to take action based
on this situation at the time.

00:49:01.020 --> 00:49:04.680
I think that helps with
some of the risk, right?

00:49:04.680 --> 00:49:06.280
Mitigating some of that risk.

00:49:06.280 --> 00:49:07.980
And then just always--

00:49:07.980 --> 00:49:10.080
I realize these
situations are dangerous,

00:49:10.080 --> 00:49:15.050
but being very
hyperaware of everything

00:49:15.050 --> 00:49:16.280
that's going on around you.

00:49:16.280 --> 00:49:20.960
So I always tell people that a
healthy dose of fear, I think,

00:49:20.960 --> 00:49:23.400
is what helps you survive
in these environments.

00:49:23.400 --> 00:49:28.850
So fear is what I
use to sort of help

00:49:28.850 --> 00:49:31.850
me stay on top of everything
that's going on around me.

00:49:31.850 --> 00:49:34.730
So fear's just a normal
human emotion, right?

00:49:34.730 --> 00:49:37.370
So don't ever beat
yourself up for feeling

00:49:37.370 --> 00:49:38.770
scared or intimidated.

00:49:38.770 --> 00:49:40.500
Fear, I use it to my advantage.

00:49:40.500 --> 00:49:43.640
It keeps me awake, alert, on
my toes, aware of everything

00:49:43.640 --> 00:49:45.180
going on around me.

00:49:45.180 --> 00:49:45.920
Fear's fine.

00:49:45.920 --> 00:49:50.000
Complacency is what
will kill you, right?

00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:51.514
When you're in
these environments

00:49:51.514 --> 00:49:53.930
where there is a lot of inherent
risk and a lot of danger,

00:49:53.930 --> 00:49:58.170
it's complacency
that is dangerous.

00:49:58.170 --> 00:50:01.460
So stay scared, right?

00:50:01.460 --> 00:50:02.090
Stay scared.

00:50:02.090 --> 00:50:04.280
Stay intimidated by the
mountain and just keep

00:50:04.280 --> 00:50:06.196
an eye out for everything
going on around you.

00:50:06.196 --> 00:50:09.530
And don't be afraid to just
pull the plug on the whole thing

00:50:09.530 --> 00:50:11.700
and head back down if that's
the right thing to do.

00:50:11.700 --> 00:50:12.440
ERICA FOX: Great.

00:50:12.440 --> 00:50:16.670
Another question
from the livestream.

00:50:16.670 --> 00:50:18.329
How do you finance
your expeditions?

00:50:18.329 --> 00:50:20.120
And can you talk about
how this has changed

00:50:20.120 --> 00:50:22.250
from when you started to now?

00:50:22.250 --> 00:50:26.240
ALISON LEVINE: So fundraising is
one of my least favorite things

00:50:26.240 --> 00:50:27.200
in the world.

00:50:27.200 --> 00:50:33.142
But it is a necessary evil
when it comes to these trips.

00:50:33.142 --> 00:50:34.850
An Everest expedition
right now, just the

00:50:34.850 --> 00:50:39.330
permit to go to Everest
is $11,000 per person.

00:50:39.330 --> 00:50:43.550
So when we were fundraising,
the cost was about $25,000

00:50:43.550 --> 00:50:44.840
a person.

00:50:44.840 --> 00:50:48.170
I had $70,000 of debt.

00:50:48.170 --> 00:50:50.170
I didn't know
anyone else who was

00:50:50.170 --> 00:50:51.602
a climber who had any money.

00:50:51.602 --> 00:50:53.810
So we had to go out and
raise the funds for the trip.

00:50:53.810 --> 00:50:56.210
And I ended up connecting
with a friend of mine

00:50:56.210 --> 00:50:59.620
from grad school who worked in
the Mercury division of Ford.

00:50:59.620 --> 00:51:02.810
And he helped us funnel the idea
of the First American Women's

00:51:02.810 --> 00:51:05.251
Everest Expedition up to
the senior Ford executives

00:51:05.251 --> 00:51:05.750
in Michigan.

00:51:05.750 --> 00:51:10.790
And they actually agreed
to fund our entire trip.

00:51:10.790 --> 00:51:13.880
And they agreed to fund us,
because our expedition just

00:51:13.880 --> 00:51:15.440
happened to coincide
with the launch

00:51:15.440 --> 00:51:18.680
of their new full-size SUV,
which was, of course, the Ford

00:51:18.680 --> 00:51:20.540
Expedition.

00:51:20.540 --> 00:51:22.040
So it was perfect timing, right?

00:51:22.040 --> 00:51:23.140
ERICA FOX: Serendipity.

00:51:23.140 --> 00:51:23.450
ALISON LEVINE: Right?

00:51:23.450 --> 00:51:24.300
There you go.

00:51:24.300 --> 00:51:26.450
So perfect timing for that.

00:51:26.450 --> 00:51:29.540
And it was just all about
casting a really wide net.

00:51:29.540 --> 00:51:33.050
I sent so many
proposal letters out

00:51:33.050 --> 00:51:36.500
to so many companies and so many
individuals trying to get help.

00:51:36.500 --> 00:51:38.594
And I was raising money
for this cancer research

00:51:38.594 --> 00:51:40.760
foundation called the V
Foundation at the same time.

00:51:40.760 --> 00:51:43.051
So I was trying to raise
money for this cancer research

00:51:43.051 --> 00:51:46.160
grant, which was completely
separate from fundraising

00:51:46.160 --> 00:51:48.120
for the expedition.

00:51:48.120 --> 00:51:53.060
So I was soliciting
donations and ideas

00:51:53.060 --> 00:51:54.290
and stuff all the time.

00:51:54.290 --> 00:51:56.150
And what sparked the
thing for Ford is,

00:51:56.150 --> 00:51:59.060
I was at the Half Moon
Bay pumpkin festival.

00:51:59.060 --> 00:52:02.254
And I'd been trying to
fundraise for so long.

00:52:02.254 --> 00:52:03.920
And we just kept
getting no, no, no, no.

00:52:03.920 --> 00:52:05.670
I'm at the Half Moon
Bay pumpkin festival.

00:52:05.670 --> 00:52:08.750
And I walk by this-- they
call it a concept car, which

00:52:08.750 --> 00:52:11.570
is a car that might
be on display that's

00:52:11.570 --> 00:52:14.990
not in actual production or no
plans for actual production.

00:52:14.990 --> 00:52:18.710
But I walk past this
humongous white SUV

00:52:18.710 --> 00:52:22.330
and it's called the
Himalayan Expedition.

00:52:22.330 --> 00:52:23.820
And it's this big Ford thing.

00:52:23.820 --> 00:52:26.097
And I was like, oh, timeout!

00:52:26.097 --> 00:52:27.680
I was like, wait a
minute, this is it.

00:52:27.680 --> 00:52:30.130
And I'm looking at this
big, monstrous SUV.

00:52:30.130 --> 00:52:31.140
It was like, this is it!

00:52:31.140 --> 00:52:32.210
This is it!

00:52:32.210 --> 00:52:32.840
Ford!

00:52:32.840 --> 00:52:36.590
I'd been brainstorming all these
ideas more related to sports.

00:52:36.590 --> 00:52:41.240
And I was trying Nike and
Adidas and people at ESPN.

00:52:41.240 --> 00:52:43.880
I sent a letter to Dick Vitale.

00:52:43.880 --> 00:52:44.840
Can you help us?

00:52:44.840 --> 00:52:49.490
And he sent me back a 8 by
10 glossy with his signature

00:52:49.490 --> 00:52:50.120
on it.

00:52:50.120 --> 00:52:52.411
I was like, that's not going
to get me to the mountain,

00:52:52.411 --> 00:52:55.370
but thank you, because
I was a Dickie V fan.

00:52:55.370 --> 00:52:58.502
But it was just that idea,
like, the Half Moon Bay pumpkin

00:52:58.502 --> 00:52:59.960
festival is what
sparked that idea.

00:52:59.960 --> 00:53:02.797
Seeing that concept car on
display, I thought, Ford.

00:53:02.797 --> 00:53:03.380
Wait a minute.

00:53:03.380 --> 00:53:03.963
Wait a minute.

00:53:03.963 --> 00:53:07.610
And then I thought, oh, I know
a guy that works in the Mercury

00:53:07.610 --> 00:53:08.660
division of Ford.

00:53:08.660 --> 00:53:11.000
I don't know him well, but
he was in my business school

00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:11.499
class.

00:53:11.499 --> 00:53:12.590
So I reached out to him.

00:53:12.590 --> 00:53:14.930
He funneled the idea up
through the people at Ford.

00:53:14.930 --> 00:53:17.810
Their director of global
marketing was a woman.

00:53:17.810 --> 00:53:18.830
She liked the idea.

00:53:18.830 --> 00:53:20.600
So that's just how you do it.

00:53:20.600 --> 00:53:23.150
And then I've also had
people actually approach me

00:53:23.150 --> 00:53:25.760
for other expeditions,
where they

00:53:25.760 --> 00:53:28.019
say, we're sponsoring
this expedition,

00:53:28.019 --> 00:53:29.060
will you be a part of it?

00:53:29.060 --> 00:53:34.660
And so I think having all the
media coverage of our 2002

00:53:34.660 --> 00:53:36.410
expedition, even though
we didn't make it,

00:53:36.410 --> 00:53:39.230
sort of helped me get on the
radar of some other expeditions

00:53:39.230 --> 00:53:43.500
that were planning things and
got roped into them that way.

00:53:43.500 --> 00:53:46.150
ERICA FOX: So we have a lot of
Googlers in the room-- sorry,

00:53:46.150 --> 00:53:49.740
guys, I'm just asking
one more question--

00:53:49.740 --> 00:53:51.440
in the room and
on the livestream

00:53:51.440 --> 00:53:56.840
who are amazing at
what they do and work

00:53:56.840 --> 00:54:00.200
with people and data
and places and maps

00:54:00.200 --> 00:54:02.540
and all of the products
that Google has.

00:54:02.540 --> 00:54:05.150
If you could direct
our energies,

00:54:05.150 --> 00:54:07.100
do you have any suggestions
or requests of us,

00:54:07.100 --> 00:54:08.975
given that you've been
to such amazing places

00:54:08.975 --> 00:54:15.390
in the world that are touched
by the things that we do

00:54:15.390 --> 00:54:17.760
and also the efforts
that we stand behind?

00:54:17.760 --> 00:54:20.580
ALISON LEVINE: So
this is something

00:54:20.580 --> 00:54:24.330
that I've learned
in every workplace,

00:54:24.330 --> 00:54:26.884
every polar environment, and
every mountain I've been to,

00:54:26.884 --> 00:54:28.300
something that
makes a difference.

00:54:28.300 --> 00:54:34.500
So sometimes we're so focused
on innovation and performance

00:54:34.500 --> 00:54:38.070
and doing our jobs and achieving
more and this and that,

00:54:38.070 --> 00:54:40.080
and you set these
really high goals

00:54:40.080 --> 00:54:42.340
and you want to achieve them.

00:54:42.340 --> 00:54:46.050
But what we sometimes
forget about

00:54:46.050 --> 00:54:49.590
is to focus on the
people around us

00:54:49.590 --> 00:54:53.580
and reminding those people
how valuable they are to you,

00:54:53.580 --> 00:54:55.230
how valuable they
are to the team,

00:54:55.230 --> 00:54:57.730
and how important
they are to you.

00:54:57.730 --> 00:55:00.900
For example, on my 2010
Everest expedition,

00:55:00.900 --> 00:55:06.060
there was a guy on the trip
who was the strongest climber

00:55:06.060 --> 00:55:07.110
physically on the team.

00:55:07.110 --> 00:55:10.170
He was 6'4, former Navy guy.

00:55:10.170 --> 00:55:12.660
He had a PhD from MIT.

00:55:12.660 --> 00:55:15.450
This guy was so smart,
so strong physically,

00:55:15.450 --> 00:55:18.570
so much experience, strongest
guy on the trip every day.

00:55:18.570 --> 00:55:22.230
For whatever reason, when it
came time for our summit push,

00:55:22.230 --> 00:55:24.420
he started struggling.

00:55:24.420 --> 00:55:26.370
And we got to Camp
2 and he said,

00:55:26.370 --> 00:55:28.770
I don't know if I'm
going to continue.

00:55:28.770 --> 00:55:30.776
He said, I can't feel my hands.

00:55:30.776 --> 00:55:31.650
I can't feel my feet.

00:55:31.650 --> 00:55:33.340
I feel this tingling sensation.

00:55:33.340 --> 00:55:35.760
I'm feeling some
anxiety about going on.

00:55:35.760 --> 00:55:37.110
And I may turn back.

00:55:37.110 --> 00:55:40.620
And I thought, this guy has
been such an amazing teammate.

00:55:40.620 --> 00:55:41.960
He is such a strong climber.

00:55:41.960 --> 00:55:44.010
He was out in front every day.

00:55:44.010 --> 00:55:45.350
I don't want him to turn back.

00:55:45.350 --> 00:55:47.970
And so I said to him
at dinner, I said,

00:55:47.970 --> 00:55:50.430
you are not going to turn back.

00:55:50.430 --> 00:55:52.650
I said, you are such an
important part of this team.

00:55:52.650 --> 00:55:55.530
And if you're not standing
on the summit with me,

00:55:55.530 --> 00:55:59.430
that summit is not going to
mean nearly as much to me.

00:55:59.430 --> 00:56:00.354
What can I do?

00:56:00.354 --> 00:56:01.770
What can the rest
of us do to help

00:56:01.770 --> 00:56:03.360
you to get you to keep going?

00:56:03.360 --> 00:56:05.310
Because I'm telling
you, I don't really

00:56:05.310 --> 00:56:07.500
want to go unless
you're there too.

00:56:07.500 --> 00:56:09.360
And he thought about
it for a few minutes.

00:56:09.360 --> 00:56:11.880
And he said, you know what?

00:56:11.880 --> 00:56:12.970
I'll give it a try.

00:56:12.970 --> 00:56:14.820
And he made it to the summit.

00:56:14.820 --> 00:56:16.500
But a couple of weeks
after we got back,

00:56:16.500 --> 00:56:17.970
he sent me this really
nice note in the mail.

00:56:17.970 --> 00:56:20.160
And he said, thank you so
much for the encouragement

00:56:20.160 --> 00:56:23.640
at Camp 2, because that is
what got me off the fence

00:56:23.640 --> 00:56:25.306
and convinced me to continue.

00:56:25.306 --> 00:56:27.680
And I thought, well, it was
just a few words just saying,

00:56:27.680 --> 00:56:29.100
I don't want you to turn back.

00:56:29.100 --> 00:56:30.058
You're important to me.

00:56:30.058 --> 00:56:31.260
I want you to be there.

00:56:31.260 --> 00:56:33.690
I want to high-five you or
fist bump you at the summit.

00:56:33.690 --> 00:56:35.273
It's not going to
mean as much to me--

00:56:35.273 --> 00:56:37.470
this journey isn't going
to mean as much to me

00:56:37.470 --> 00:56:38.850
if you're not on it too.

00:56:38.850 --> 00:56:42.750
And it really taught me the
importance of telling people

00:56:42.750 --> 00:56:46.560
how important they are because
you never know the impact

00:56:46.560 --> 00:56:49.350
that a few kind words can have.

00:56:49.350 --> 00:56:51.210
And you assume that
people know because they

00:56:51.210 --> 00:56:54.030
got a promotion or they got
a raise or they got a bonus

00:56:54.030 --> 00:56:57.930
or whatever, you assume
they know how valuable they

00:56:57.930 --> 00:57:00.960
are to you and to the team and
how important they are to you.

00:57:00.960 --> 00:57:04.020
But everybody needs that
boost every now and then.

00:57:04.020 --> 00:57:07.960
Even the strongest performers
have their down days.

00:57:07.960 --> 00:57:11.920
Even the most skilled people
have periods of doubt.

00:57:11.920 --> 00:57:15.510
And if you can be that
person to just give somebody

00:57:15.510 --> 00:57:18.150
a little encouragement and tell
them how much they mean to you

00:57:18.150 --> 00:57:20.130
and how important
they are to the team,

00:57:20.130 --> 00:57:21.840
that can really
make a difference

00:57:21.840 --> 00:57:24.460
in outcomes in
certain situations.

00:57:24.460 --> 00:57:26.220
So I would say, in
addition to focusing

00:57:26.220 --> 00:57:30.450
on technology and
innovation and market share

00:57:30.450 --> 00:57:33.690
and all that stuff, focus
on the people around you

00:57:33.690 --> 00:57:37.500
and reminding them how
important they are.

00:57:37.500 --> 00:57:38.414
ERICA FOX: Thank you.

00:57:38.414 --> 00:57:40.330
And I really appreciate
you coming and sharing

00:57:40.330 --> 00:57:40.590
your adventures--

00:57:40.590 --> 00:57:41.630
ALISON LEVINE: Yeah, thanks
for having me, you guys.

00:57:41.630 --> 00:57:42.480
Thanks for allowing
me to be your guest.

00:57:42.480 --> 00:57:44.646
ERICA FOX: --tips and
recommendations for all of us.

00:57:44.646 --> 00:57:46.350
It's incredibly inspiring.

00:57:46.350 --> 00:57:46.840
ALISON LEVINE: Yeah,
thanks, you guys.

00:57:46.840 --> 00:57:47.740
ERICA FOX: Thank you.

00:57:47.740 --> 00:57:53.190
