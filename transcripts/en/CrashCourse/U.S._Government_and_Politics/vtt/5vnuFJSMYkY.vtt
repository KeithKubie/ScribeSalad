00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:08.120
Hi, I'm Craig, and this is Crash Course Government and Politics and today we're gonna talk about government.

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:10.640
I know what you're thinking, "Craig we're been talking about government for thirteen weeks."

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:13.700
To that I say, you got me, but let's talk about actual governing,

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:18.520
in particular the executive branch tools and strategies that the president uses to try to get things done.

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:20.920
I mean, the president's just one person, for now --

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.980
-- who knows what sort of animal-human hybrid will be president in the future --

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:27.180
but there's a lot of presidenting to
be done in the United States

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:36.180
[Theme Music]

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.671
So we usually just talk about the president as if he's the entire executive branch, but obviously there's more to it than that.

00:00:40.671 --> 00:00:45.791
Technically, the entire federal bureaucracy is part of the executive branch, but it's really big and complicated.

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.780
For today, let's just look at the top-levels. The big-wigs. The Hank Greens. The head honchos.

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.820
The ones that deal most directly with the president. Hank Green doesn't work for the Government.

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.680
At the top of the organizational pyramid is the president, of course,

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.820
and I suppose just below him is the vice president, ready to break a tie in the Senate,

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:03.440
or step in if the president dies, or go to a shopping mall opening on behalf of the president.

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.472
To paraphrase Truman's desk, the buck stops with the president,

00:01:06.472 --> 00:01:10.832
meaning he has the ultimate decision in important matters and therefore takes the blame when they go wrong.

00:01:10.832 --> 00:01:14.696
George W. Bush once called himself the decider, and there's a lot of truth to that description,

00:01:14.696 --> 00:01:17.680
but many, probably most, policy decisions are made at lower levels,

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.896
because there are just too many of them for the president to make them all.

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.840
The president is served directly by the White House Staff, which is made up mostly of trusted

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.340
policy and political advisors called "special assistants"

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:28.040
Special assistant, I need more coffee!

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:32.180
Other than television versions, we don't see much of the White House staff, except for the press secretary,

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:36.380
who's the public spokesperson for the president, and maybe the Chief of Staff can be a public figure as well.

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:41.575
Next in terms of proximity to the president and influence on his decisions is the Executive Office of the President.

00:01:41.575 --> 00:01:43.957
It's staffed by various advisers and policy experts.

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.620
They're selected by the president and his office rather than by rising through

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:50.920
the ranks of government employment, or they're chosen for political reasons like many cabinet secretaries.

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.900
The officials in the EOP give important advice to the president on specified topics.

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:56.960
Although there are a lot of different
departments in the EOP,

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:01.280
probably the most important are the National Security Council, the Council of Economic Advisors,

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.140
and the Office of Management and Budget, the OMB.

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.600
The Cabinet used to be very important in advising the president, and still can be, but that depends on the president.

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:11.400
Some presidents rely a lot on the heads of Cabinet departments,

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.660
and usually the Secretary of State and the Secratary of Defence play a significant role in the administration,

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.920
especially if there's a lot of foreign
policy issues to deal with.

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.260
The Cabinet secretaries tend to become prominent when bad things happen.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:25.120
For example in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, the Treasury Secretary was in the news a lot.

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.120
You sometimes hear a lot about the Attorney General, who heads the Justice Department

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.120
when civil rights issues crop up, like same-sex marriage or affirmative action.

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.660
And if there's a terrorist threat, you might be seeing a lot more of the Secretary of Homeland Security.

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:38.520
There are also independent agencies and government corporations, which, historically speaking

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.720
are relatively new, with the exception of the postal service.

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.200
The postal service is one of the oldest functioning government agencies,

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.220
although it's now a government corporation, which means it's supposed to earn money and be self-funding.

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.900
My fiancee's dad worked for the postal service so...postal workers are awesome, sir.

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.680
Sadly, the postal office isn't doing that great
financially, so buy a stamp once in a while!

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.480
Send a letter to an old friend or something. How else are you going to send it without the post office?

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.420
An eagle? No.

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.280
Amtrak is the other well-known government corporation and it isn't profitable either.

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.734
How else are you gonna get around? The eagle isn't big enough to take you. Unless you're Gandalf.

00:03:09.734 --> 00:03:12.754
Independent agencies and regulatory commissions appear in the news a lot,

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:17.120
usually in stories buried in the back pages, or whatever the digital equivalent of the back pages are.

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:18.420
Your uncle's blog?

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.293
But they're rarely called independent agencies.

00:03:20.293 --> 00:03:24.713
NASA's probably the best known independent agency, because everyone knows space travel is awesome.

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.094
Watch Crash Course Astronomy as well as Sci Show Space.

00:03:28.094 --> 00:03:30.274
But for now keep watching Government and Politics, thanks.

00:03:30.274 --> 00:03:33.254
But other more down-to-earth agencies include the Federal Trade Commission,

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.840
the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the Federal Communications Commission.

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.700
It's easy to remember those three are regulatory commissions,

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:41.880
because they have the word 'commission' built right in, so that's helpful.

00:03:41.895 --> 00:03:44.955
And for most of us, even if we don't realize it, the most important independent  federal agency is

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:49.460
the Federal Reserve System, which manages banking and monetary policy,

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:52.971
and which will get its own episode later, because it's really important and kind of mysterious.

00:03:52.971 --> 00:03:57.751
Will I get my own episode later? How Craig relates to the government? I'm kind of mysterious.

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:00.160
So that's the structure of the executive branch, more or less.

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:03.680
These agencies are the tools that the government has to make policy and to implement it.

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:06.660
They are the heart and soul of  actual governing but they aren't all that fun,

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:09.720
especially when you look at what strategies the president uses to actually govern.

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:14.040
Political scientists will tell you, and I'm not gonna argue with them, they're scientists, they went to college,

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:17.060
that the president has three main strategies at his disposal:

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:20.620
Party leadership, mobilizing public opinion, and administrative strategies.

00:04:20.623 --> 00:04:22.792
One of these is much more important than the other two.

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.840
Which one is it, can you guess? Which one?

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.940
It's not party leadership, but the president is the leader of his political party

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:31.800
and can use it to create and manage policy, especially in Congress, where party matters a lot.

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:34.794
The president usually appoints members of his own party to head agencies.

00:04:34.794 --> 00:04:39.514
And once appointed, party affiliation doesn't matter much to an agency head, because  he's not running for office.

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:42.620
Control of the party makes it easier for the president to get choices through congress though.

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:45.060
This strategy doesn't work when there's divided government,

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:47.960
but when one party controls both chambers of Congress and the White House,

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:52.580
it's easier for the president to use his position as party leader as leverage to accomplish his policy goals

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:57.020
When they're in different parties? Not so much.
Hoo, it's more like this.

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:00.660
That was my third eagle punch of the video.
Hat trick!

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:05.040
Mobilizing public opinion is also not the most important tool in the president's toolbox,

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:07.100
but going public is what I'm going to talk about right now.

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:10.900
The president's access to the media is almost limitless. Now that doesn't mean he gets free Netflix,

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:14.460
although he might, especially if he just shares a log-in with the vice president or something.

00:05:14.464 --> 00:05:18.064
But, if he wants a press conference, or a speech on national TV, he gets it.

00:05:18.064 --> 00:05:22.180
This use of the media is sometimes called the bully pulpit, and it sounds like a big policy stick,

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:26.590
but it has a downside. Basically, it's not really gonna work if the president isn't popular,

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:29.158
and his approval rating almost always declines the longer he is in office

00:05:29.158 --> 00:05:33.278
This leaves us the third tool that the president can use to get things done, administrative strategy.

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:38.120
Yes, that's the most important one, using administrative agencies to make and carry out policies.

00:05:38.122 --> 00:05:40.402
Hoo-hah, yeah! Let's go to the Thought Bubble.

00:05:40.406 --> 00:05:43.926
There are a number of ways that the president can use his administrative offices to bring about

00:05:43.926 --> 00:05:47.886
the objectives he wants. Over time the president has expanded the size and capacities

00:05:47.886 --> 00:05:51.006
of the executive office of the president, especially since the New Deal.

00:05:51.006 --> 00:05:55.780
This enlarged EOP gathers information about policies, plans programs, communicates with constituents,

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:58.840
including Congress and interest groups and it can supervise other agencies

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:01.760
and check up on how they're working. One of the most important examples of this

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:05.160
is the expanded reach of the office of management and budget, or OMB,

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:08.340
to plan the budget and exercise huge influence over how government money is spent.

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:11.880
Another administrative strategy that the president can use is regulatory review.

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:15.220
Federal agencies are usually required to make rules for how they operate. The president's office

00:06:15.223 --> 00:06:19.597
can review these rules, make suggestions, or even order agencies to adopt certain rules.

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:23.060
This can have enormous direct and indirect influence over how the rule is implemented.

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:27.440
To give an example, president Bill Clinton ordered the FDA to make rules so that tobacco companies couldn't

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:31.620
advertise to children, so you don't see cigarette ads on kids' TV, or any TV actually,

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:36.500
and that's why teenagers never smoke, ever. They just ride their heelies around and play Pokenan.

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:40.360
The president can also try to influence the way a law is implemented by issuing a signing statement

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:44.160
when he signs a bill into law. This is the White House's interpretation of what the law means

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:47.620
and they become a part of the legislative history that courts can use if the laws are challenged,

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:51.140
although it's not clear that they have any real legal weight, and they might violate separation of powers

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:54.280
because courts are supposed to decide what a law means, not the president.

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:58.740
The most important administrative strategy that the president has at his disposal is the executive order.

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:02.980
These are presidential directives that have the force of law and presidents have used them for major policies

00:07:02.988 --> 00:07:05.508
that would have been difficult to get through Congress. Thanks, Thought Bubble.

00:07:05.508 --> 00:07:09.000
When I say that executive action has been used to push through major policies,

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.920
I mean MAJOR policies, like purchasing Louisiana, annexing Texas, emancipating the slaves,

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:17.400
interning Japanese Americans during WWII, desegregating the army,

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:19.480
creating the peace corps, and implementing affirmative action.

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:22.980
Presidents increasingly rely on administrative strategies for a number of reasons,

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:24.340
but especially because they work.

00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:28.920
Administrative strategies usually happen outside of the public eye, which makes it easier for the president to act

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:32.720
Courts usually defer to administrative actions, especially in the area of national defense.

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:36.440
And administrative action can be much more efficient than having to wait for a majority

00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:40.340
of 535 members of Congress to agree on something, especially if it's something important.

00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:44.000
But the increasingly large and powerful executive branch is controversial,

00:07:44.008 --> 00:07:47.968
and critics have worried about the growing power of the president since FDR, or maybe even since Jackson.

00:07:47.968 --> 00:07:50.928
There's an argument that the founders of the country preferred a weak executive branch,

00:07:50.928 --> 00:07:53.500
and not because all that administration is expensive,

00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:56.860
but there are also a few arguments in favor of an expanded presidency that you should know about.

00:07:56.860 --> 00:08:01.920
The first is that in emergencies the nation needs a leader who can act fast, and the president is the best suited to be that leader.

00:08:01.928 --> 00:08:04.508
Maybe Captain America as well, but he's fictional.

00:08:04.508 --> 00:08:08.888
Of course this could potentially give him an incentive to create emergencies and further increase his power,

00:08:08.888 --> 00:08:10.815
but how about let's not get cynical, ok?

00:08:10.815 --> 00:08:14.975
The second argument holds that the president is more able to act in the public interest because he's the center of public attention

00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:19.080
and thus easily held accountable, and because he only has to run for re-election once.

00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:22.820
The third argument in favor of a powerful president is that he is the only nationally elected official

00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:24.400
and thus the most democratic one.

00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:30.700
The only nationally elected official? Really? What about  errrr....oh yeah, you're right.

00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:33.700
The idea is that since most people pay
attention to the presidential elections

00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:38.160
by choosing one person over another, the majority
of the public is implicitly endorsing his policies.

00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:42.000
I mean, everyone loves the president's policies. Everyone.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.160
Do you buy it? I'm not sure that I do. Maybe you do.

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:48.700
But, increasing the complexity of our understanding is kind of what we do here at Crash Course.

00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:50.660
Thanks for watching, I'll see you next time.

00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:54.660
