00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Again, the dynamic trace gives us the answer.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:10.000
We have the variable quote, which is read over here and last set up here.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
So this becomes part of the dynamic slice.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Likewise, we have quote which is read up here, for instance,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and set up here.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
This also becomes part of the dynamic slice.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
However, these two lines, tag being set to true and tag being set to false,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000
are never executed and therefore the values they set into tag--

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
therefore, these two statements do not become part of the dynamic slice.
