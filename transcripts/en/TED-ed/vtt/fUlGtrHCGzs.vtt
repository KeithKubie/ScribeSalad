00:00:07.796 --> 00:00:11.336
From Shakespeare’s plays 
to modern TV dramas,

00:00:11.336 --> 00:00:15.966
the unscrupulous schemer for whom 
the ends always justify the means

00:00:15.966 --> 00:00:20.040
has become a familiar character type 
we love to hate.

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:22.925
So familiar, in fact, that for centuries

00:00:22.925 --> 00:00:28.235
we’ve had a single word to describe 
such characters: Machiavellian.

00:00:28.235 --> 00:00:33.388
But is it possible that we’ve been using 
that word wrong this whole time?

00:00:33.388 --> 00:00:37.388
The early 16th century statesman Niccoló 
Machiavelli

00:00:37.388 --> 00:00:41.468
wrote many works of history, philosophy, 
and drama.

00:00:41.468 --> 00:00:47.638
But his lasting notoriety comes from a 
brief political essay known as The Prince,

00:00:47.638 --> 00:00:51.088
framed as advice to current 
and future monarchs.

00:00:51.088 --> 00:00:53.818
Machiavelli wasn’t the first to do this–

00:00:53.818 --> 00:00:58.648
in fact there was an entire tradition of 
works known as “mirrors for princes”

00:00:58.648 --> 00:01:01.128
going back to antiquity.

00:01:01.128 --> 00:01:03.078
But unlike his predecessors,

00:01:03.078 --> 00:01:06.248
Machiavelli didn’t try to describe an 
ideal government

00:01:06.248 --> 00:01:09.928
or exhort his audience to rule 
justly and virtuously.

00:01:09.928 --> 00:01:13.208
Instead, he focused on the 
question of power–

00:01:13.208 --> 00:01:16.628
how to acquire it, and how to keep it.

00:01:16.628 --> 00:01:18.898
And in the decades after it was published,

00:01:18.898 --> 00:01:22.648
The Prince gained a diabolical reputation.

00:01:22.648 --> 00:01:24.888
During the European Wars of Religion,

00:01:24.888 --> 00:01:28.118
both Catholics and Protestants 
blamed Machiavelli

00:01:28.118 --> 00:01:32.768
for inspiring acts of violence and tyranny
committed by their opponents.

00:01:32.768 --> 00:01:34.251
By the end of the century,

00:01:34.251 --> 00:01:39.111
Shakespeare was using “Machiavel” to 
denote an amoral opportunist,

00:01:39.111 --> 00:01:42.321
leading directly to our popular use of 
“Machiavellian”

00:01:42.321 --> 00:01:45.741
as a synonym for manipulative villainy.

00:01:45.741 --> 00:01:46.981
At first glance,

00:01:46.981 --> 00:01:51.861
The Prince’s reputation as a manual for 
tyranny seems well-deserved.

00:01:51.861 --> 00:01:57.141
Throughout, Machiavelli appears entirely 
unconcerned with morality,

00:01:57.141 --> 00:02:02.258
except insofar as it’s helpful or harmful 
to maintaining power.

00:02:02.258 --> 00:02:06.579
For instance, princes are told to 
consider all the atrocities necessary

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:07.689
to seize power,

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:10.279
and to commit them in a single stroke

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:12.359
to ensure future stability.

00:02:12.359 --> 00:02:16.359
Attacking neighboring territories and 
oppressing religious minorities

00:02:16.359 --> 00:02:19.989
are mentioned as effective ways of 
occupying the public.

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:22.429
Regarding a prince’s personal behavior,

00:02:22.429 --> 00:02:25.769
Machiavelli advises keeping up the 
appearance of virtues

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:27.869
such as honesty or generosity,

00:02:27.869 --> 00:02:32.689
but being ready to abandon them as soon 
as one’s interests are threatened.

00:02:32.689 --> 00:02:35.116
Most famously, he notes that for a ruler,

00:02:35.116 --> 00:02:38.466
“it is much safer to be feared 
than loved.”

00:02:38.466 --> 00:02:42.401
The tract even ends with an appeal to 
Lorenzo de’ Medici,

00:02:42.401 --> 00:02:44.921
the recently installed ruler of Florence,

00:02:44.921 --> 00:02:49.801
urging him to unite the fragmented 
city-states of Italy under his rule.

00:02:49.801 --> 00:02:54.711
Many have justified Machiavelli as 
motivated by unsentimental realism

00:02:54.711 --> 00:03:00.181
and a desire for peace in an Italy torn by
internal and external conflict.

00:03:00.181 --> 00:03:01.481
According to this view,

00:03:01.481 --> 00:03:05.111
Machiavelli was the first to understand 
a difficult truth:

00:03:05.111 --> 00:03:07.411
the greater good of political stability

00:03:07.411 --> 00:03:12.191
is worth whatever unsavory tactics 
are needed to attain it.

00:03:12.191 --> 00:03:16.751
The philosopher Isaiah Berlin suggested 
that rather than being amoral,

00:03:16.751 --> 00:03:20.111
The Prince hearkens back to 
ancient Greek morality,

00:03:20.111 --> 00:03:26.281
placing the glory of the state above the 
Christian ideal of individual salvation.

00:03:26.281 --> 00:03:30.370
But what we know about Machiavelli might
not fit this picture.

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:35.423
The author had served in his native 
Florence for 14 years as a diplomat,

00:03:35.423 --> 00:03:38.880
staunchly defending its elected 
republican government

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:41.100
against would-be monarchs.

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.440
When the Medici family seized power,

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.380
he not only lost his position,

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:48.340
but was even tortured and banished.

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:49.700
With this in mind,

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:52.950
it’s possible to read the pamphlet 
he wrote from exile

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:55.300
not as a defense of princely rule,

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:58.730
but a scathing description 
of how it operates.

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:01.930
Indeed, Enlightenment figures like Spinoza

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:03.990
saw it as warning free citizens

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:08.630
of the various ways in which they can be
subjugated by aspiring rulers.

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:11.680
In fact, both readings might be true.

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:15.190
Machiavelli may have written a manual for 
tyrannical rulers,

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:20.340
but by sharing it, he also revealed 
the cards to those who would be ruled.

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:21.313
In doing so,

00:04:21.313 --> 00:04:23.843
he revolutionized political philosophy,

00:04:23.843 --> 00:04:27.153
laying the foundations for Hobbes and 
future thinkers

00:04:27.153 --> 00:04:30.933
to study human affairs based on their 
concrete realities

00:04:30.933 --> 00:04:33.163
rather than preconceived ideals.

00:04:33.173 --> 00:04:35.913
Through his brutal and shocking honesty,

00:04:35.913 --> 00:04:41.643
Machiavelli sought to shatter popular 
delusions about what power really entails.

00:04:41.643 --> 00:04:44.755
And as he wrote to a friend 
shortly before his death,

00:04:44.755 --> 00:04:50.145
he hoped that people would “learn the way 
to Hell in order to flee from it."
