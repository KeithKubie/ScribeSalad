00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.846
Let's try another problem on inverse variation using light. The intensity of

00:00:04.846 --> 00:00:09.291
light varies inveresely as a square of the distance from the source. So think

00:00:09.291 --> 00:00:13.693
about if we shine the light unto a screen. This screen would have a light spot

00:00:13.693 --> 00:00:18.497
on it and this would be the intnsity of light on the screen. We measure this

00:00:18.497 --> 00:00:23.395
intensity on whats called a foot candle, so if a light source is 5 feet from a

00:00:23.395 --> 00:00:28.530
screen There will be an intensity of 2 foot candles knowing this let's find the

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:33.514
intensity on the screen if this light source was moved to 20 feet away. Now you

00:00:33.514 --> 00:00:37.674
might never have heard of a foot candle before but just know that foot candle is

00:00:37.674 --> 00:00:41.250
a way that we can measure intensity. Look this up if you want to learn more

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.480
about light and foot candles. Distance here is just measured in feet, so 5 feet

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:51.120
would be a distance, as would 20 feet. So try to figure this problem out and

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.810
remember that the intensity of light is varying inversely with the square of the

00:00:55.810 --> 00:01:00.433
distance. Think carefully about the proportion you need to setup and when you're

00:01:00.433 --> 00:01:01.993
ready put your answer here.
