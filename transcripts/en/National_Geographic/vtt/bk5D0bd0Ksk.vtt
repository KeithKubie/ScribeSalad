( intro music )

00:00:34.534 --> 00:00:36.502
<i> Rick Smolan: This sort of
 underlying message</i>

00:00:36.502 --> 00:00:38.837
<i> that you're as powerful
 as you allow yourself to be</i>

00:00:38.837 --> 00:00:41.040
<i> is one of the things I think
 has resonated with people</i>

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.377
<i> for years about Robyn's trip.</i>

00:00:44.377 --> 00:00:46.813
<i> That she doesn't
 describe herself as a hero,</i>

00:00:46.813 --> 00:00:48.515
<i> she doesn't say
 she's courageous.</i>

00:00:48.515 --> 00:00:50.850
<i> She actually talks about
 her fears very openly</i>

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.718
<i> but she does it anyway,
 which is I think the thing</i>

00:00:52.718 --> 00:00:56.289
<i> that people have admired
 so much about her.</i>

00:01:01.093 --> 00:01:02.194
( applause )

00:01:02.194 --> 00:01:03.863 line:0%
Rick Smolan: I...
was given an assignment

00:01:03.863 --> 00:01:06.900 line:0%
by<i> Time</i> magazine in 1977,

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.968 line:0%
to go to
the outback of Australia,

00:01:08.968 --> 00:01:12.372
and to shoot a cover story
about Aborigines.

00:01:12.372 --> 00:01:14.406
<i> And the writer had
 already written the story</i>

00:01:14.406 --> 00:01:16.508
<i> and my job was to
 go out and illustrate</i>

00:01:16.508 --> 00:01:17.609
<i> the story that he had written,</i>

00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:20.513
<i> a wonderful gentleman named
 Roy Rowan.</i>

00:01:20.513 --> 00:01:22.515
He had worked with
a social worker

00:01:22.515 --> 00:01:24.083
who had taken him
into the Aboriginal camps

00:01:24.083 --> 00:01:26.185
to get him permission
to take photographs.

00:01:26.185 --> 00:01:28.788
And so I called this woman
before I got to Alice Springs,

00:01:28.788 --> 00:01:30.690
and I said,
"Could you also take me out

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:32.324
to some of the same places
you took the writer?"

00:01:32.324 --> 00:01:33.960
And she said,
"Sure, meet me at this

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.095
little pub down the street
from this hotel,"

00:01:36.095 --> 00:01:37.630
she suggested I stay at.

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:39.965
So, I checked into my hotel,
I walked out of the hotel

00:01:39.965 --> 00:01:43.169
<i> and there washing
 the window of my hotel</i>

00:01:43.169 --> 00:01:45.738
<i> was the most beautiful woman
 I had ever seen in my life.</i>

00:01:45.738 --> 00:01:47.773
<i> And so I took
 a few photographs,</i>

00:01:47.773 --> 00:01:50.009
<i> and she got really angry.</i>

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.844
And she said,
"Put your damn cameras down!

00:01:51.844 --> 00:01:53.579
Who the hell are you?"
And I said, "I'm really sorry,

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:54.747
I didn't mean to get you
upset."

00:01:54.747 --> 00:01:56.815
And I left
and I then took a turn and

00:01:56.815 --> 00:01:58.484
went to the place I should've
gone in the first place

00:01:58.484 --> 00:02:00.586
and I met the social worker.

00:02:00.586 --> 00:02:02.188
And she said,
"Well, a group of us

00:02:02.188 --> 00:02:03.222
who work with Aborigines

00:02:03.222 --> 00:02:05.591
are going to get together
tonight for dinner.

00:02:05.591 --> 00:02:06.859
You might want to come
and meet some of the

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:08.327
other social workers,
people involved

00:02:08.327 --> 00:02:10.262
in the
Aboriginal Rights Movement,"

00:02:10.296 --> 00:02:11.898
and so she gave me
the address.

00:02:11.898 --> 00:02:13.366
And of course,
who opens the door

00:02:13.366 --> 00:02:15.134
but the woman
who had been washing

00:02:15.134 --> 00:02:16.235
the windows of the hotel,

00:02:16.235 --> 00:02:18.571
who was not at all pleased
to see me.

00:02:18.571 --> 00:02:20.607
And she said, you know,
"What are you doing here?"

00:02:20.607 --> 00:02:22.375
And I said,
"Well, your friend,

00:02:22.375 --> 00:02:23.743
Jenny, invited me."
And she said,

00:02:23.776 --> 00:02:25.745
"You can't photograph
my friends."

00:02:25.745 --> 00:02:26.880
I said, "Okay, so..."

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:27.980
She said,
"Put your cameras down!"

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:29.082
So I put the cameras, like

00:02:29.082 --> 00:02:30.616
leave your guns at the door,
you know.

00:02:30.616 --> 00:02:33.452
So... so, I put
my cameras down

00:02:33.452 --> 00:02:34.854
and I walked into this house,

00:02:34.854 --> 00:02:36.055
which was literally
falling apart,

00:02:36.055 --> 00:02:37.223
there was no back
to the house.

00:02:37.223 --> 00:02:40.593
And in the backyard
she had four camels tied up.

00:02:40.593 --> 00:02:43.095
And I said,
"Why do you have camels?"

00:02:43.095 --> 00:02:44.864
She says,
"None of your business." So...

00:02:44.864 --> 00:02:46.232
( audience laughing )

00:02:46.232 --> 00:02:47.600
So I found Jenny and said,

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.435
"Why does she have camels
in the backyard?"

00:02:49.435 --> 00:02:51.604
And she said,
"Oh, she's this odd girl

00:02:51.604 --> 00:02:53.105
that showed up here a year ago.
We don't really know

00:02:53.105 --> 00:02:55.040
where she is from...
what she is doing here

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:56.509
but she... we bring her food,

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:57.944
we come out here
and we visit her.

00:02:57.944 --> 00:02:59.279
We're kind of worried
about her,

00:02:59.279 --> 00:03:01.080
but she has this crazy idea
that she is going to walk

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.516
2,000 miles from here,
Alice Springs,

00:03:03.516 --> 00:03:06.052
the heart of the desert,
through the Gibson Desert,

00:03:06.052 --> 00:03:07.553
out to the Indian Ocean."
And I said,

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.988
"Okay, well it's pretty crazy."

00:03:09.988 --> 00:03:12.191
So throughout the week
I worked with Jenny,

00:03:12.191 --> 00:03:14.159
at the end of the week
she said,

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:15.961
"Robyn wrote to
<i> National Geographic</i>

00:03:15.961 --> 00:03:18.464
a year ago and
never got any answer at all.

00:03:18.464 --> 00:03:19.899
She asked them
if they would like,

00:03:19.899 --> 00:03:21.067
underwrite her trip.

00:03:21.067 --> 00:03:23.536
And she thought maybe
you might know someone there

00:03:23.536 --> 00:03:25.304
or she could use your name,
because

00:03:25.304 --> 00:03:27.139
she is just so tired of
washing windows

00:03:27.139 --> 00:03:28.942
and waiting on jerks
in pubs and..."

00:03:28.942 --> 00:03:30.209
I said,
"She wants to use my name,

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:31.643
fine, you know, whatever."

00:03:31.643 --> 00:03:32.945
And I thought
that would be the end of it,

00:03:32.945 --> 00:03:34.614
and I flew back to the States.

00:03:34.614 --> 00:03:36.382
And a week later
the phone rings,

00:03:36.382 --> 00:03:37.850
and it's Bob Gilka,
who was then

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:40.019
Director of Photography here
at the Geographic.

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:42.254
He said, "We got this letter
from this woman in Australia

00:03:42.254 --> 00:03:44.790
and she's describing
this fascinating idea

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:46.926
of crossing the desert
with camels and...

00:03:46.926 --> 00:03:48.528
but you know,
we don't want the headline

00:03:48.528 --> 00:03:50.897
<i> 'National Geographic</i> explorer
dies in week two.' ( laughter )

00:03:50.897 --> 00:03:53.432
You know, in the outback,
is she a nutcase,

00:03:53.432 --> 00:03:54.967
is she for real..."
( audience laughing )

00:03:54.967 --> 00:03:58.036
I said,
"Well, she is very intense.

00:03:58.036 --> 00:03:59.905
I've seen her camels,
I've seen her maps,

00:03:59.905 --> 00:04:03.176
I mean... you know,
she is very focused."

00:04:03.176 --> 00:04:04.443
And he said,
"Well, since you guys are

00:04:04.443 --> 00:04:05.645
such good friends,
would you like..."

00:04:05.645 --> 00:04:06.912
( audience roaring
with laughter )

00:04:06.912 --> 00:04:08.681
I'm serious.

00:04:08.681 --> 00:04:11.617
"Would you like to be the
photographer that we send out

00:04:11.617 --> 00:04:13.719
to meet her five times
in the desert,

00:04:13.719 --> 00:04:16.089
to document her trip?"
And it's like,

00:04:16.089 --> 00:04:17.456
I remember having
two reactions,

00:04:17.456 --> 00:04:19.091
which is "This is so cool,"

00:04:19.091 --> 00:04:21.927
and like, "Oh my God,"
you know... ( laughter )

00:04:21.927 --> 00:04:23.329
Be careful what you wish for.

00:04:23.329 --> 00:04:26.332
So, there's always been
sort of a mystery

00:04:26.332 --> 00:04:28.334
to Robyn's trip, which is...

00:04:28.334 --> 00:04:29.435
why did she do this,

00:04:29.435 --> 00:04:30.836
why did she want to go
on this journey?

00:04:30.836 --> 00:04:32.304
<i> And a lot of her friends
 were worried</i>

00:04:32.304 --> 00:04:34.674
<i> that this was a
 weird form of suicide.</i>

00:04:34.674 --> 00:04:37.309
<i> Robyn's mother had died
 when she was 11-years old,</i>

00:04:37.309 --> 00:04:38.877
<i> and a lot of her friends
 thought</i>

00:04:38.877 --> 00:04:40.913
<i> this was some kind of
 echo of that.</i>

00:04:40.913 --> 00:04:42.781
And it was a
bizarre form of it.

00:04:42.781 --> 00:04:45.284
I never thought that,
and Robyn certainly doesn't...

00:04:45.284 --> 00:04:47.086
didn't think that,
and doesn't think it.

00:04:47.086 --> 00:04:48.253
No one at the time knew that

00:04:48.253 --> 00:04:49.889
she was an
unbelievable writer.

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:53.092
She is now sort of like the
J. D. Salinger of Australia.

00:04:53.092 --> 00:04:54.993
Everyone reads her book,
<i> Tracks</i> , in high school now.

00:04:54.993 --> 00:04:56.362
<i> It's actually required reading</i>

00:04:56.362 --> 00:04:57.997
<i> and they have study guides
 about it.</i>

00:04:57.997 --> 00:05:01.099
<i> So, Robyn got funding
 from</i> National Geographic<i> ,</i>

00:05:01.099 --> 00:05:04.236
<i> and it's funny because they
 flew me back to Australia,</i>

00:05:04.236 --> 00:05:06.072
<i> when Bob Gilka interviewed her</i>

00:05:06.072 --> 00:05:08.274
<i> to make sure that
 they really wanted to do this.</i>

00:05:08.274 --> 00:05:10.710
And we went out
and had a drink afterwards

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:12.277
and after the third drink,

00:05:12.277 --> 00:05:14.080
she looked at me and said,
"What are you doing here?"

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:15.347
And I said, "What?"

00:05:15.347 --> 00:05:16.849
She said,
"What are you doing here?"

00:05:16.849 --> 00:05:17.883
And I thought "Oh my God,

00:05:17.883 --> 00:05:19.785
the woman is actually
really nuts."

00:05:19.785 --> 00:05:22.221
And she said, "No,"
she said like,

00:05:22.221 --> 00:05:24.957
"I've just completely
sold out my whole trip."

00:05:24.957 --> 00:05:26.325
I said,
"What are you talking about?"

00:05:26.325 --> 00:05:27.960
She said, "I don't want
my friends to come,

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:29.395
I don't want you coming,

00:05:29.395 --> 00:05:31.530
and now I've got to write
a story for this magazine."

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:33.365
I said, "Robyn,
they're across the street

00:05:33.365 --> 00:05:35.034
at the hotel,
go back and tell them

00:05:35.034 --> 00:05:36.636
you don't want the money."
I mean

00:05:36.636 --> 00:05:39.505
you haven't done anything yet,
if you really feel

00:05:39.505 --> 00:05:41.874
this is something that's
going to destroy your trip..."

00:05:41.874 --> 00:05:44.443
And she said, "I can't,
I can't spend another year,

00:05:44.476 --> 00:05:46.545
you know, doing odd jobs."

00:05:46.545 --> 00:05:48.680
And this was sort of her
conflict from the beginning,

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:50.482
of wanting to do this all
by herself

00:05:50.482 --> 00:05:51.784
but also needing some help,

00:05:51.784 --> 00:05:53.586
and it's something that
sort of went on throughout...

00:05:53.586 --> 00:05:55.487
the whole trip.

00:05:55.487 --> 00:05:58.557
<i> She had this wonderful dog
 named Diggity,</i>

00:05:58.557 --> 00:06:02.028
<i> that was her daughter,
 her companion, her friend.</i>

00:06:02.028 --> 00:06:03.463
<i> So much of this trip was</i>

00:06:03.463 --> 00:06:05.064
<i> her relationship
 with this dog.</i>

00:06:05.064 --> 00:06:08.600
She said that two years before
she came to Alice Springs,

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:10.569
she got a job at a hospital
as a janitor,

00:06:10.569 --> 00:06:12.605
basically, you know,
emptying out trash bins.

00:06:12.605 --> 00:06:16.542
And she said,
one night, this first week

00:06:16.542 --> 00:06:17.710
she was working
at this hospital,

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:20.479
she heard these terrible cries
coming from the basement.

00:06:20.479 --> 00:06:22.748
And she went downstairs
and found out they were

00:06:22.748 --> 00:06:23.949
basically taking strays

00:06:23.949 --> 00:06:26.585
and doing experiments
on these animals.

00:06:26.585 --> 00:06:28.221
You know testing them
for cosmetics,

00:06:28.221 --> 00:06:29.388
if it burned their eyes
and stuff.

00:06:29.388 --> 00:06:30.723
She said it was just
absolutely horrible

00:06:30.723 --> 00:06:31.858
she couldn't stand it.

00:06:31.858 --> 00:06:33.292
So the second night

00:06:33.292 --> 00:06:35.094
she waited until
all the other janitors left

00:06:35.094 --> 00:06:36.462
and she went back in
with the keys,

00:06:36.462 --> 00:06:38.997
opened up all the cages
and let all the animals loose,

00:06:38.997 --> 00:06:41.601
opened up all the doors
and one little puppy

00:06:41.601 --> 00:06:43.235
had been brought in that day,
that was Diggity.

00:06:43.235 --> 00:06:44.936
I have goose bumps
telling the story.

00:06:44.936 --> 00:06:47.373
And, so Diggity became
like her companion.

00:06:47.373 --> 00:06:50.509
And Diggity saved her life
so many times during the trip,

00:06:50.509 --> 00:06:52.144
it was unbelievable.

00:06:52.144 --> 00:06:54.180
If... if a snake or centipede

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:55.614
had crawled into her
sleeping bag,

00:06:55.614 --> 00:06:56.849
Diggity would bark
and tell her

00:06:56.849 --> 00:06:58.284
there is something
in the sleeping bag.

00:06:58.284 --> 00:07:00.118
<i> If she got lost Diggity
 could lead her back to</i>

00:07:00.118 --> 00:07:01.887
<i> where she'd left the camels.</i>

00:07:01.887 --> 00:07:03.922
<i> But one night,
 it was a full moon,</i>

00:07:03.922 --> 00:07:06.058
<i> we were by Ayers Rock,
 called "Uluru"</i>

00:07:06.058 --> 00:07:07.960
<i> by the Aborigines.</i>

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:09.829
<i> And she was snuggling
 with Diggity,</i>

00:07:09.829 --> 00:07:11.564
<i> one of my favorite pictures
 from the trip.</i>

00:07:11.564 --> 00:07:14.433
<i> Obviously the Geographic
 for the most part uses color,</i>

00:07:14.433 --> 00:07:17.236
<i> so this picture just sat
 in my archives for years</i>

00:07:17.236 --> 00:07:18.570
<i> and then this picture
 just became</i>

00:07:18.603 --> 00:07:19.806
<i> Robyn's official portrait</i>

00:07:19.806 --> 00:07:21.606
<i> in the National
 Portrait Gallery in Australia,</i>

00:07:21.606 --> 00:07:22.741
<i> which is wonderful. I just...</i>

00:07:22.741 --> 00:07:25.811
<i> I love the picture of her
 and Diggity together.</i>

00:07:25.845 --> 00:07:27.546
<i> The first time
 Robyn saw the Rock,</i>

00:07:27.546 --> 00:07:28.681
<i> I mean, you hear
 about these things</i>

00:07:28.681 --> 00:07:30.817
<i> and you think it's like
 a tourist attraction.</i>

00:07:30.817 --> 00:07:32.918
<i> But it's actually
 the middle of the desert.</i>

00:07:32.918 --> 00:07:34.419
<i> And you realize
 that this was actually</i>

00:07:34.419 --> 00:07:36.755
<i> once the bottom of the ocean.</i>

00:07:36.755 --> 00:07:38.424
<i> Circumference of this is
 five miles,</i>

00:07:38.424 --> 00:07:40.426
<i> if you actually ride
 around the outside of it.</i>

00:07:40.426 --> 00:07:43.362
<i> But there is a little cave
 up there at the top.</i>

00:07:43.362 --> 00:07:45.297
<i> And in the next picture
 you're going to see...</i>

00:07:45.297 --> 00:07:47.767
<i> It's Robyn inside that cave.</i>

00:07:47.767 --> 00:07:49.668
( audience gasping )

00:07:49.668 --> 00:07:50.936
So, one of the things that was

00:07:50.936 --> 00:07:52.238
challenging on this trip
is that

00:07:52.238 --> 00:07:54.673
Robyn didn't wear
clothes a lot.

00:07:54.673 --> 00:07:56.608
( audience laughing )
And...

00:07:56.608 --> 00:07:57.976
<i> it was challenging for
 lots of reasons</i>

00:07:57.976 --> 00:07:59.912
<i> as you can imagine, but...</i>

00:07:59.912 --> 00:08:01.113
( audience laughing )

00:08:01.113 --> 00:08:02.848
<i> Ah, so, I decided</i>

00:08:02.848 --> 00:08:04.450
I didn't want to send
pictures of Robyn,

00:08:04.483 --> 00:08:05.617
who I was falling
in love with,

00:08:05.617 --> 00:08:07.386
back to the Geographic,

00:08:07.386 --> 00:08:09.155
because I just didn't feel
comfortable

00:08:09.155 --> 00:08:11.057
sharing these pictures.
So, I would only send

00:08:11.057 --> 00:08:12.958
the pictures that I wanted
the Geographic to see.

00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:15.327
And the Geographic got
really angry at me,

00:08:15.327 --> 00:08:17.229
because you are not supposed
to do that.

00:08:17.229 --> 00:08:18.997
And I... they basically said,

00:08:18.997 --> 00:08:21.000
"You're never going to work
for us again."

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.335
And I was sort of committing
professional suicide,

00:08:23.335 --> 00:08:25.204
because this, you know,
I was 28 years old

00:08:25.204 --> 00:08:27.506
at that point and I was,

00:08:27.506 --> 00:08:29.408
you know, my loyalties,
to be honest,

00:08:29.408 --> 00:08:31.077
were to Robyn
and not to my career,

00:08:31.077 --> 00:08:33.679
and not to the Geographic.
I just felt like, you know,

00:08:33.679 --> 00:08:35.514
the more the trip went on,
the more concerned

00:08:35.548 --> 00:08:38.250
I was about her,
the more fond I was of her,

00:08:38.250 --> 00:08:39.752
and the more worried
I was that

00:08:39.752 --> 00:08:40.819
something's going to
happen to her.

00:08:40.819 --> 00:08:42.588
Every time I left her...

00:08:42.588 --> 00:08:45.924
I remember I would look in the
rear-view mirror of my car

00:08:45.924 --> 00:08:47.159
and wonder if that
would be the last time

00:08:47.159 --> 00:08:48.628
I'd ever see her.

00:08:49.628 --> 00:08:51.496
<i> She had brought
 a cassette player</i>

00:08:51.496 --> 00:08:53.432
<i> with Aboriginal
 language tapes,</i>

00:08:53.432 --> 00:08:55.034
<i> to speak "Pitjantjatjara".</i>

00:08:55.034 --> 00:08:57.336
<i> I'm not sure
 I am saying that correctly.</i>

00:08:57.336 --> 00:08:59.805
<i> Most tourists, most people
 that go out there</i>

00:08:59.805 --> 00:09:02.541
<i> treat Aborigines like
 they want to learn about them,</i>

00:09:02.541 --> 00:09:03.676
they are anthropologists.

00:09:03.676 --> 00:09:05.645
Robyn really wanted to
actually...

00:09:05.645 --> 00:09:06.879
she felt that there was
something

00:09:06.879 --> 00:09:09.848
that they could teach her
and I think...

00:09:09.848 --> 00:09:11.717
She sort of become...
became a legend.

00:09:11.717 --> 00:09:12.818
Whenever
I would ask Aborigines,

00:09:12.818 --> 00:09:14.052
"Have you seen
the camel lady?"

00:09:14.052 --> 00:09:16.321
Which is what they called her,

00:09:16.321 --> 00:09:18.291
they had such fondness and
respect for what she was doing

00:09:18.291 --> 00:09:21.293
because she was taking
the time to slowly travel

00:09:21.293 --> 00:09:23.028
through the places
where they lived.

00:09:23.028 --> 00:09:24.363
And she wanted to spend time
with them

00:09:24.363 --> 00:09:26.231
and learn from them.

00:09:26.231 --> 00:09:27.599
She said that,
you know, people...

00:09:27.599 --> 00:09:29.501
said wasn't it hard,
wasn't it frightening?

00:09:29.501 --> 00:09:31.503
and she actually talks about it
with a sense of wonder.

00:09:31.503 --> 00:09:33.739
She said it was so beautiful
and so quiet.

00:09:33.739 --> 00:09:35.074
I remember at night

00:09:35.074 --> 00:09:36.709
when you looked up
at the stars,

00:09:36.709 --> 00:09:39.912
it was... you know,
there was no visual pollution,

00:09:39.912 --> 00:09:42.748
no traffic lights,
there were no street lights,

00:09:42.748 --> 00:09:45.951
no buildings and
so the clarity of the heavens

00:09:45.951 --> 00:09:48.420
were just amazing there.

00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:50.656
<i> And she said
 on one of these trips,</i>

00:09:50.656 --> 00:09:52.625
<i> and I was actually there
 when this happened...</i>

00:09:52.625 --> 00:09:54.559
<i> She was travelling
 with the camels,</i>

00:09:54.559 --> 00:09:55.861
<i> she was in a really good mood,</i>

00:09:55.861 --> 00:09:58.063
<i> everything seemed to be going
 really, really well.</i>

00:09:58.063 --> 00:09:59.831
<i> And then it started raining.</i>

00:09:59.831 --> 00:10:02.501
When it rains camels will
stop dead in their tracks,

00:10:02.501 --> 00:10:04.737
and they won't move
because they have no traction.

00:10:04.737 --> 00:10:06.938
She was trying to get to
a place called Docker River,

00:10:06.938 --> 00:10:08.140
which is about ten miles away

00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:09.641
from where we were
at that point.

00:10:09.641 --> 00:10:11.844
<i> And so she kept going
 in the rain,</i>

00:10:11.844 --> 00:10:14.079
<i> and kind of forcing the camels
 to walk.</i>

00:10:14.079 --> 00:10:15.414
<i> Right after I took
 this picture,</i>

00:10:15.414 --> 00:10:17.550
<i> one of her camels,
 Dookie, fell.</i>

00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:20.018
And camels are like horses.
If they break a leg,

00:10:20.018 --> 00:10:21.687
you basically have to
put them down,

00:10:21.687 --> 00:10:23.722
because they...
it doesn't heal.

00:10:23.722 --> 00:10:25.824
<i> And he laid
 on the ground groaning</i>

00:10:25.824 --> 00:10:27.493
<i> and she thought
 he had broken his leg.</i>

00:10:27.493 --> 00:10:29.895
<i> He wouldn't move.
 It took...for about six hours.</i>

00:10:29.895 --> 00:10:31.664
So, I drove ahead
to the Aboriginal Mission

00:10:31.664 --> 00:10:34.567
and we called a vet who we
actually flew out.

00:10:34.567 --> 00:10:37.469
<i> The vet said it looked like
 he had just sprained his leg,</i>

00:10:37.469 --> 00:10:39.604
<i> but it was going to take
 six weeks to heal.</i>

00:10:39.604 --> 00:10:42.707
<i> So, she ends up living
 at Docker River for six weeks.</i>

00:10:42.707 --> 00:10:44.109
You know, sort of life
is what happens

00:10:44.109 --> 00:10:46.012
while you are busy making
other plans.

00:10:46.012 --> 00:10:48.013
This ended up becoming
a great experience for her

00:10:48.013 --> 00:10:49.281
because she got to spend time

00:10:49.281 --> 00:10:51.683
in this one Aboriginal Mission
instead of stopping

00:10:51.683 --> 00:10:53.318
and travelling on.

00:10:53.318 --> 00:10:54.753
<i> One of the things
 that was so wonderful</i>

00:10:54.753 --> 00:10:56.955
<i> about the Aboriginal kids
 is that they were so excited</i>

00:10:56.955 --> 00:10:59.025
<i> whenever she showed up
 in these villages.</i>

00:10:59.025 --> 00:11:00.325
<i> This is probably one of
 my favorite pictures</i>

00:11:00.325 --> 00:11:02.861
<i> from the whole trip.
 I just love that.</i>

00:11:02.861 --> 00:11:04.430
<i> You can just see
 all the body language,</i>

00:11:04.430 --> 00:11:05.731
<i> all the excitement
 of the kids.</i>

00:11:05.731 --> 00:11:07.833
<i> "The camel lady is here,
 the camel lady is here."</i>

00:11:07.833 --> 00:11:09.101
<i> It's just wonderful.</i>

00:11:09.101 --> 00:11:11.536
<i> It was nice to see her
 happy too and the kids</i>

00:11:11.536 --> 00:11:13.839
<i> really kind of brought her
 out of herself,</i>

00:11:13.839 --> 00:11:16.741
<i> in wonderful ways.</i>

00:11:16.741 --> 00:11:19.678
I would show up sometimes and

00:11:19.678 --> 00:11:23.682
I remembering showing up
once and she said...

00:11:23.682 --> 00:11:25.985
"You Americans treat
friendship like Valium."

00:11:25.985 --> 00:11:27.920
It was like, you know,
"Really?"

00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:30.055
( audience laughing )

00:11:30.055 --> 00:11:32.358
It's like it's an insult
or challenge of the day.

00:11:32.358 --> 00:11:33.592
Robyn was doing this
to herself as well

00:11:33.592 --> 00:11:35.428
but I thought
at a certain point

00:11:35.428 --> 00:11:37.463
we had sort of gotten over
the initial hostility

00:11:37.463 --> 00:11:39.532
and I said, "Okay, what's that
supposed to mean?"

00:11:39.532 --> 00:11:42.100
She said, "Well, every time
I see Americans together,

00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:43.502
they're all saying,
'Don't worry,

00:11:43.502 --> 00:11:45.905
everything will be fine.
It will all work out'."

00:11:45.905 --> 00:11:47.473
And I said,
"And that's a bad thing?"

00:11:47.473 --> 00:11:50.075
She says, "Yeah, because
if you care about somebody

00:11:50.075 --> 00:11:51.243
and they are doing
something stupid,

00:11:51.243 --> 00:11:52.344
if they are marrying
the wrong person,

00:11:52.344 --> 00:11:53.578
they have an abusive boss,

00:11:53.578 --> 00:11:54.713
they are doing,
they are taking drugs,

00:11:54.747 --> 00:11:56.581
whatever it is, you hit them
over the head

00:11:56.581 --> 00:11:58.984
with a two-by-four.
You risk your friendship

00:11:58.984 --> 00:12:00.952
to be a friend and maybe
you lose them as friends."

00:12:00.952 --> 00:12:02.621
But, she said,
"You are all cowards.

00:12:02.621 --> 00:12:04.556
Like you won't actually...

00:12:04.556 --> 00:12:06.191
be friends to each other
because you are afraid

00:12:06.191 --> 00:12:07.759
you'll lose the friendship."
And I...

00:12:07.759 --> 00:12:09.694
I remember thinking,
"Wow, that's... I mean,

00:12:09.694 --> 00:12:11.063
that's a really
interesting thought,"

00:12:11.063 --> 00:12:12.798
I had never, you know...

00:12:12.798 --> 00:12:14.300
I said, "You know,
you're right, I mean,

00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:16.234
I am not speaking
for all Americas but I mean..."

00:12:16.234 --> 00:12:18.303
There were so many
conversations like

00:12:18.303 --> 00:12:20.005
that where she had a
really different way of like,

00:12:20.038 --> 00:12:22.207
approaching things.

00:12:22.207 --> 00:12:24.209
And it was sort of my year
of growing up too.

00:12:24.209 --> 00:12:26.345
I mean,
I was 27, 28 years old, but

00:12:26.345 --> 00:12:28.247
emotionally,
I was like 19 years old.

00:12:28.247 --> 00:12:31.183
Every girlfriend I had had
lasted a week and then,

00:12:31.183 --> 00:12:33.118
somebody gave me an
assignment and I could leave.

00:12:33.118 --> 00:12:34.153
( audience laughing )

00:12:34.153 --> 00:12:35.654
We'll work it out
when I come back

00:12:35.654 --> 00:12:37.155
and I would never come back.
So...

00:12:37.155 --> 00:12:38.523
( audience laughing )

00:12:38.523 --> 00:12:40.993
You know...
this experience with Robyn,

00:12:40.993 --> 00:12:44.396
who was like so much older
and wiser than her 26 years.

00:12:44.396 --> 00:12:46.565
I mean it was like,
literally like,

00:12:46.565 --> 00:12:48.834
spending time with a really
interesting, profound person

00:12:48.834 --> 00:12:50.869
that wouldn't let you get away
with anything.

00:12:50.869 --> 00:12:53.271
So, I mean, I was constantly
having to either defend

00:12:53.271 --> 00:12:55.607
or think or be challenged,
it was just...

00:12:55.607 --> 00:12:56.742
the whole thing was
so fascinating.

00:12:56.742 --> 00:12:59.344
So, at one point
during the trip...

00:12:59.344 --> 00:13:01.113
Early in the trip,
one morning she woke up

00:13:01.113 --> 00:13:02.481
and she said,
"I had this dream

00:13:02.481 --> 00:13:04.616
about this Aboriginal man
that came out of nowhere

00:13:04.616 --> 00:13:06.552
and travelled with me."
And I had a journal,

00:13:06.552 --> 00:13:08.620
I was keeping a journal
throughout the whole trip.

00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:11.490
And I came back, you know,
like the third time out there

00:13:11.490 --> 00:13:13.225
and she was with this
little Aboriginal man.

00:13:13.225 --> 00:13:15.427
<i> I said, "Who is this?"
 She said, "This is Mr. Eddie."</i>

00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:17.962
<i> And she said,
 "He came out of nowhere</i>

00:13:17.962 --> 00:13:19.198
<i> and he is travelling with me."</i>

00:13:19.198 --> 00:13:20.932
<i>I said, "Just like your dream."
 She said, "What do you mean?"</i>

00:13:20.932 --> 00:13:22.534
I said, "Don't you remember
the dream you had

00:13:22.534 --> 00:13:23.702
at the beginning of the trip?"

00:13:23.702 --> 00:13:25.137
She says, "I didn't have
a dream about..."

00:13:25.170 --> 00:13:28.707
I showed her in my journal...
you dreamt this guy.

00:13:28.707 --> 00:13:30.809
<i> Mr. Eddie travelled
 with her for six weeks.</i>

00:13:30.809 --> 00:13:32.911
<i> He was incredible.
 He was a tribal elder.</i>

00:13:32.911 --> 00:13:34.613
<i> He didn't speak
 a word of English,</i>

00:13:34.613 --> 00:13:36.047
<i> and travelled with her
 for six weeks.</i>

00:13:36.047 --> 00:13:38.584
<i> Came out of nowhere,
 taught her how to find food</i>

00:13:38.584 --> 00:13:40.786
<i> in the outback,
 took her to sacred areas</i>

00:13:40.786 --> 00:13:42.754
<i> that no one was
 supposed to go to.</i>

00:13:42.754 --> 00:13:45.290
<i> Mr. Eddie became one of her
 most cherished memories</i>

00:13:45.290 --> 00:13:46.524
<i> of her whole journey.</i>

00:13:46.524 --> 00:13:49.061
One day I got a telegram
from her, I was in Hong Kong,

00:13:49.061 --> 00:13:50.428
And the telegram said,

00:13:50.428 --> 00:13:52.798
"Could you please
bring me a rifle?"

00:13:52.798 --> 00:13:55.000
And it was the same rifle
I knew she already had.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.904
And the reason is because
when male camels are in heat,

00:13:58.904 --> 00:14:00.272
if you have a female camel,

00:14:00.272 --> 00:14:02.541
they will kill you
to get to your female.

00:14:02.541 --> 00:14:04.810
So, I said to her
when she was telling me

00:14:04.810 --> 00:14:06.812
about it on the trip,
how would a camel kill you?

00:14:06.812 --> 00:14:08.647
You know... chew you to death
or something?

00:14:08.647 --> 00:14:09.982
I am trying to figure out.

00:14:09.982 --> 00:14:12.083
And she said, "No, actually,
it's pretty frightening."

00:14:12.083 --> 00:14:15.554
They... you know, camels
have necks that are so strong,

00:14:15.554 --> 00:14:18.757
that... they can lift 15
grown men on their neck.

00:14:18.757 --> 00:14:21.226
So what a camel will do is
come over and knock you over

00:14:21.226 --> 00:14:23.695
with its neck and it will sit
on you and suffocate you.

00:14:23.695 --> 00:14:25.396
These are very
intelligent animals.

00:14:25.396 --> 00:14:27.332
I mean, it's very interesting

00:14:27.332 --> 00:14:28.366
that they've actually
figured out

00:14:28.366 --> 00:14:30.402
to kill human beings, right?

00:14:30.402 --> 00:14:32.671
But when they are in heat,
they... they have this bladder

00:14:32.671 --> 00:14:34.440
that comes out of their mouth
and foam and...

00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:35.774
It's like a lot of animals
in heat

00:14:35.774 --> 00:14:37.209
and if you have a female,

00:14:37.209 --> 00:14:38.777
they will kill you
to get to the female.

00:14:38.777 --> 00:14:41.379
And if they lure
the female off, she is dead.

00:14:41.379 --> 00:14:43.616
She... These camels
carried all of her food,

00:14:43.616 --> 00:14:44.750
all of her water,
all of her gear.

00:14:44.750 --> 00:14:47.252
So, if they ran away,
she was dead out there.

00:14:47.252 --> 00:14:49.822
So, she actually was attacked
at one point,

00:14:49.822 --> 00:14:51.289
by a group of wild camels.

00:14:51.289 --> 00:14:53.358
So when I... And she had to
kill two of them,

00:14:53.358 --> 00:14:55.327
which was heartbreaking to her
because she obviously,

00:14:55.327 --> 00:14:56.829
you know, she loves animals.

00:14:56.829 --> 00:14:58.163
So I had this
horrible thought,

00:14:58.163 --> 00:15:00.532
"Oh my God, she's lost
her gun somewhere."

00:15:00.532 --> 00:15:02.667
So I, you know,
when I drove out there,

00:15:02.701 --> 00:15:04.202
I thought, "My God, I'm going
to bring her the gun,"

00:15:04.202 --> 00:15:06.304
and it turned out
it was a gift for Mr. Eddie.

00:15:06.304 --> 00:15:07.906
<i> She had her gun, she was fine,</i>

00:15:07.906 --> 00:15:10.209
<i> but Mr. Eddie just loved
 this gun of hers</i>

00:15:10.209 --> 00:15:12.044
<i> and so he was so excited</i>

00:15:12.044 --> 00:15:15.981
<i> when I got out of the car
 and I had this gun.</i>

00:15:15.981 --> 00:15:17.849
On one of the trips
I came out,

00:15:17.849 --> 00:15:20.052
I was sitting by the fire
and Robyn said,

00:15:20.052 --> 00:15:22.020
"When are you going to
get here?"

00:15:22.020 --> 00:15:23.856
And I had come in
about four hours before

00:15:23.856 --> 00:15:25.824
and I was sitting there
and I was talking about

00:15:25.824 --> 00:15:28.060
something I had just done
somewhere else and she said...

00:15:28.060 --> 00:15:29.160
I said, "Excuse me?"

00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:30.829
She said, "When are you
going to get here?"

00:15:30.829 --> 00:15:33.165
I thought okay now she's
actually now flipped out.

00:15:33.165 --> 00:15:34.800
I said,
"Robyn, I am sitting here

00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:37.068
across the fire from you.
Hello!"

00:15:37.102 --> 00:15:38.203
She said, "No, you're not here!"

00:15:38.303 --> 00:15:41.039
She said, "You are talking
about your<i> Time</i> cover story,

00:15:41.039 --> 00:15:42.574
where you're going to leave
the car in three weeks,

00:15:42.574 --> 00:15:44.209
did your film get x-rayed..."
She said,

00:15:44.209 --> 00:15:46.679
"You know, you come out here
and you spend the entire time

00:15:46.679 --> 00:15:47.746
talking about
something you did

00:15:47.746 --> 00:15:48.914
or something
you're going to do.

00:15:48.914 --> 00:15:49.982
And if you are
going to be here,

00:15:49.982 --> 00:15:51.149
then God damn it, be here.

00:15:51.149 --> 00:15:53.252
And don't be lost in your head
the whole time."

00:15:53.252 --> 00:15:54.553
It's... again it's one of
those things

00:15:54.553 --> 00:15:55.721
where somebody kind of...
goes like that.

00:15:55.721 --> 00:15:56.889
And you go, you know what,

00:15:56.889 --> 00:15:57.989
how many of you now

00:15:57.989 --> 00:15:59.524
have looked at people
in restaurants,

00:15:59.524 --> 00:16:01.159
where there is a couple
in a restaurant

00:16:01.159 --> 00:16:02.660
and they are both doing
this...

00:16:02.660 --> 00:16:03.995
And they are talking to
everybody except

00:16:03.995 --> 00:16:05.731
the person they are...
with, right?

00:16:05.731 --> 00:16:07.532
I mean, if...
I was going to say,

00:16:07.532 --> 00:16:09.034
"Robyn, if you thought
it was bad back then...

00:16:09.034 --> 00:16:10.468
( audience laughing )

00:16:10.468 --> 00:16:11.870
The whole world is now
turned to that,"

00:16:11.870 --> 00:16:14.439
but again it was...
it was so,

00:16:14.439 --> 00:16:17.942
not to say refreshing,
but it was so...

00:16:17.942 --> 00:16:21.780
fascinating to have someone
constantly call you on things.

00:16:21.780 --> 00:16:24.083
And you say, "You know what,
you're absolutely right.

00:16:24.083 --> 00:16:26.151
You know, I am totally
thinking about what I did

00:16:26.151 --> 00:16:27.286
or what I am going to do."

00:16:27.286 --> 00:16:28.653
It's sort of be here now,

00:16:28.653 --> 00:16:31.022
it's that old
Zen-kinda thing, right?

00:16:31.022 --> 00:16:32.791
So, as I said before,

00:16:32.791 --> 00:16:35.660
every time I left her
I always worried that...

00:16:35.660 --> 00:16:37.930
each time I left her I'd look
in the rear-view mirror

00:16:37.930 --> 00:16:39.097
as I drove away and wonder

00:16:39.097 --> 00:16:40.965
if that would be
my last memory of her

00:16:40.965 --> 00:16:43.335
or something terrible
would happen to her out there.

00:16:43.335 --> 00:16:48.173
So... I was sitting
in Hong Kong one day

00:16:48.173 --> 00:16:50.609
and a writer, I was working
with a writer named

00:16:50.609 --> 00:16:52.344
Richard Bernstein
from<i> New York Times</i>

00:16:52.344 --> 00:16:54.346
and he was at breakfast,
I met him for breakfast.

00:16:54.346 --> 00:16:56.414
And I walked into the
Hilton Hotel and he said,

00:16:56.414 --> 00:16:58.050
"You better sit down."
And I said, "What?"

00:16:58.050 --> 00:16:59.585
He said, "Just sit down."

00:16:59.585 --> 00:17:01.552
So, I sit down, he is really
pale looking and he

00:17:01.552 --> 00:17:03.355
hands me the local paper
and the paper says,

00:17:03.355 --> 00:17:06.458
"Mysterious 'Camel Lady'
Missing in Gibson Desert,

00:17:06.458 --> 00:17:07.893
Desperate Search Underway."

00:17:07.893 --> 00:17:10.061
And I go completely cold,

00:17:10.061 --> 00:17:11.596
"Oh my God,
this... it's happened.

00:17:11.596 --> 00:17:14.032
You know, the thing I was
most afraid of."

00:17:14.032 --> 00:17:16.467
So, I rented a plane,

00:17:16.467 --> 00:17:19.705
I flew out to
this little desert town

00:17:19.705 --> 00:17:21.105
near where I thought

00:17:21.105 --> 00:17:22.775
I was going to meet her
the next time,

00:17:22.775 --> 00:17:26.011
and there were journalists,
there were trackers,

00:17:26.011 --> 00:17:27.178
there were helicopters,

00:17:27.178 --> 00:17:30.215
there were like
80 paparazzi out there.

00:17:30.215 --> 00:17:33.718
And, I... was so flummoxed
and so upset

00:17:33.718 --> 00:17:35.787
and so freaked out that I...

00:17:35.787 --> 00:17:36.955
it never occurred to me

00:17:36.955 --> 00:17:38.790
that I was leading
all of them to her.

00:17:38.790 --> 00:17:40.258
I assumed she was dead.

00:17:40.258 --> 00:17:41.626
So, I got my car, I drove

00:17:41.626 --> 00:17:42.961
to where she would have been
if every...

00:17:42.961 --> 00:17:45.063
if she had been on schedule
and there she was.

00:17:45.063 --> 00:17:46.098
( audience laughing )

00:17:46.198 --> 00:17:49.267
And I now have all these guys
and cars following me.

00:17:49.267 --> 00:17:51.336
With film crews and...

00:17:51.336 --> 00:17:53.038
And before I can say a word,

00:17:53.038 --> 00:17:55.373
they are thrusting
the newspapers in her face,

00:17:55.373 --> 00:17:57.475
with my pictures on the cover.

00:17:57.475 --> 00:17:58.810
And you know the whole time...

00:17:58.810 --> 00:17:59.878
<i> You know,
 this is what they thought</i>

00:17:59.911 --> 00:18:01.313
<i> the camel lady looked like,
 by the way.</i>

00:18:01.313 --> 00:18:05.250
( audience laughing )

00:18:05.250 --> 00:18:07.252
So, before I can say
a word to her,

00:18:07.252 --> 00:18:08.720
I mean, my first thought is
she is going to think

00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:09.822
I've sold her out.

00:18:09.822 --> 00:18:12.090
You know, because I always
worried that she thought

00:18:12.090 --> 00:18:14.560
that I was... that...
my career came first,

00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:18.096
the Geographic
came first and...

00:18:18.096 --> 00:18:20.665
You know, I finally
got her away from them

00:18:20.665 --> 00:18:22.734
and we were trying to
figure out what happened, like

00:18:22.734 --> 00:18:24.769
why did people think
you were missing.

00:18:24.769 --> 00:18:27.272
I said, "Has anything
happened, I mean,

00:18:27.272 --> 00:18:29.774
what would have done this?"
And she said, "Oh my God!"

00:18:29.774 --> 00:18:32.711
I said, "What?" And she said,
"I know what happened."

00:18:32.711 --> 00:18:34.313
I said, "What?" She said,

00:18:34.313 --> 00:18:36.548
"Two weeks ago,
this guy shows up

00:18:36.548 --> 00:18:39.217
in the middle of the night
in a racing car."

00:18:39.217 --> 00:18:40.485
I said, "What?" I thought

00:18:40.485 --> 00:18:41.853
she really has gone nuts,
right?

00:18:41.853 --> 00:18:43.187
She said, "No, no,
in the middle of the night,

00:18:43.187 --> 00:18:44.455
I hear this motor.

00:18:44.455 --> 00:18:46.091
I see these lights
coming towards me.

00:18:46.091 --> 00:18:48.260
I hadn't seen anybody
for like three weeks.

00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:50.896
And this guy screeches up

00:18:50.896 --> 00:18:53.298
with a racing car,
with big fat tires."

00:18:53.298 --> 00:18:55.901
And she said his pupils
were the size of pinpricks.

00:18:55.901 --> 00:18:58.336
This guy was so obviously
on speed or something,

00:18:58.336 --> 00:19:00.172
And she said, "He hit on me."

00:19:00.172 --> 00:19:03.708
And she told him to piss off
and he drove to Sydney.

00:19:03.708 --> 00:19:06.544
And she said, "He was breaking
the world record of driving

00:19:06.544 --> 00:19:08.780
from one side of Australia
to the other."

00:19:08.780 --> 00:19:09.948
And we found out

00:19:09.948 --> 00:19:11.683
that he had a press conference
in Sydney

00:19:11.683 --> 00:19:13.117
and one of the
journalists said,

00:19:13.117 --> 00:19:15.087
"What was the most
interesting thing

00:19:15.087 --> 00:19:17.088
about you breaking
the world's record of driving

00:19:17.088 --> 00:19:18.456
from one side of Australia
to the other?"

00:19:18.456 --> 00:19:20.925
And he said,
"Oh, I spent a romantic night

00:19:20.925 --> 00:19:22.527
in the moonlight
with a naked camel lady."

00:19:22.527 --> 00:19:23.595
( audience laughing )

00:19:23.662 --> 00:19:25.363
<i> So, all of a sudden
 they have made up this story</i>

00:19:25.363 --> 00:19:27.999
<i> of this naked camel lady
 in the moonlight in the desert</i>

00:19:27.999 --> 00:19:30.902
<i> with a racing car driver.
 She knew nothing about this.</i>

00:19:30.902 --> 00:19:32.237
<i> And so all these people
 were out there</i>

00:19:32.237 --> 00:19:33.805
<i> they had made up this story
 that she was missing.</i>

00:19:33.805 --> 00:19:36.742
<i> She was never missing
 and then like, what do you do?</i>

00:19:36.742 --> 00:19:38.544
<i> Now you've got 80 people
 in the desert like,</i>

00:19:38.544 --> 00:19:40.044
<i> how do you hide,
 how do you get rid of them?</i>

00:19:40.044 --> 00:19:44.082
So, one night I said to her...

00:19:44.082 --> 00:19:45.250
"After everybody
goes to sleep,

00:19:45.317 --> 00:19:48.320
get in my car and hide, like,
you know, in the back seat.

00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:49.421
And I am going to
tell the guys

00:19:49.421 --> 00:19:50.688
I am going for beer."

00:19:50.688 --> 00:19:53.491
And so, I basically we drove
to the next town.

00:19:53.491 --> 00:19:55.427
Her camels were fine
because they are camels,

00:19:55.427 --> 00:19:57.729
they can survive for three
or four days without water.

00:19:57.729 --> 00:20:00.231
And we went to town and
I had one of my friends send

00:20:00.231 --> 00:20:01.767
a telegram saying that

00:20:01.767 --> 00:20:04.369
Robyn has decided to call
the trip off

00:20:04.369 --> 00:20:05.937
because of
all the journalists.

00:20:05.937 --> 00:20:10.509
And that she is sending
a truck to pick up the camels.

00:20:10.509 --> 00:20:14.178
And basically all the guys
gave up and they left.

00:20:14.178 --> 00:20:15.480
We waited three days,
we didn't come back

00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:16.948
for three days.
Their budgets ran out.

00:20:16.948 --> 00:20:19.017
Basically there is nothing
to do out there.

00:20:19.050 --> 00:20:20.185
So, it's sort of
a funny scene.

00:20:20.185 --> 00:20:21.553
<i> This is when she is looking
 at the newspapers</i>

00:20:21.553 --> 00:20:25.791
<i> with pictures of herself.</i>

00:20:25.791 --> 00:20:27.626
<i> It's just insane.</i>

00:20:27.626 --> 00:20:30.528
<i> They were even doing
 cartoons about her.</i>

00:20:30.528 --> 00:20:34.166 line:0%
( audience laughing )

00:20:34.166 --> 00:20:36.168
I am not going to give you all
the ins-and-outs of the trip.

00:20:36.168 --> 00:20:38.002
She had an unbelievable
experience

00:20:38.002 --> 00:20:40.038
but she finally did make it
to the ocean.

00:20:40.038 --> 00:20:41.206
<i> It took her nine months,</i>

00:20:41.206 --> 00:20:43.575
<i> originally it was supposed
 to be a six month trip.</i>

00:20:43.575 --> 00:20:45.109
<i> The day before we got
 to the ocean she said,</i>

00:20:45.109 --> 00:20:47.178
<i> "I don't want you there
 when I get to the ocean.</i>

00:20:47.178 --> 00:20:49.647
<i> I really, just need to be
 by myself."</i>

00:20:49.647 --> 00:20:53.318
I said,
"Robyn, I have to be there."

00:20:53.351 --> 00:20:54.953
So I managed to talk her
into it

00:20:54.953 --> 00:20:57.589
<i> and now she loves
 these pictures.</i>

00:20:57.589 --> 00:20:59.123
<i> She took the camels
 into the water.</i>

00:20:59.123 --> 00:21:00.325
<i> They thought this was like</i>

00:21:00.325 --> 00:21:02.494
<i> the biggest drinking fountain
 they had ever seen.</i>

00:21:02.494 --> 00:21:03.695
( audience laughing )

00:21:03.695 --> 00:21:06.564
<i> They didn't like
 the salt water very much.</i>

00:21:06.564 --> 00:21:08.566
This sort of underlying
message

00:21:08.566 --> 00:21:10.969
that you are as powerful
as you allow yourself to be

00:21:10.969 --> 00:21:13.070
is one of the things I think
has resonated with people

00:21:13.070 --> 00:21:15.240
for years about Robyn's trip.

00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:17.642
That she doesn't describe
herself as a hero,

00:21:17.642 --> 00:21:19.344
she doesn't say
she is courageous.

00:21:19.344 --> 00:21:21.647
She actually talks about
her fears very openly

00:21:21.647 --> 00:21:23.481
but she does it anyway,
which is I think the thing

00:21:23.514 --> 00:21:27.652
that people have admired
so much about her.

00:21:27.652 --> 00:21:29.854
One of things I think
that stunned everybody

00:21:29.854 --> 00:21:31.556
at the end of the trip

00:21:31.556 --> 00:21:33.991
was that she decided
to write a book about it.

00:21:33.991 --> 00:21:36.695
And I think to
everybody's astonishment

00:21:36.695 --> 00:21:39.998
the book resonated with
people all over the world.

00:21:39.998 --> 00:21:42.400
So the story was,
this was commissioned

00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:43.968
<i> by and for</i>
National Geographic<i> .</i>

00:21:43.968 --> 00:21:45.603
<i> After it ran in the Geographic</i>

00:21:45.603 --> 00:21:47.539
<i> many other magazines
 around the world picked it up,</i>

00:21:47.572 --> 00:21:49.240
<i> I think there was over
 a 100 publications.</i>

00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:51.910
<i> They told the story in many,
 many different languages.</i>

00:21:51.910 --> 00:21:54.246
<i> Tracks</i> has now been
published in 18 languages.

00:21:54.246 --> 00:21:55.781
It's sold
over a million copies.

00:21:55.781 --> 00:21:57.549
As I said,
it's sort of a cult book

00:21:57.549 --> 00:21:59.617
in certain places
in the world.

00:21:59.617 --> 00:22:01.352
I think one of the
strangest things,

00:22:01.352 --> 00:22:03.254
it was the most stolen book

00:22:03.254 --> 00:22:04.856
the year it was published
in Australia.

00:22:04.856 --> 00:22:06.825
I don't know
how they determine that.

00:22:06.825 --> 00:22:10.162
And I don't know why it's a
sort of an odd honor to win.

00:22:10.162 --> 00:22:13.031
I am sure the booksellers
are really happy about that.

00:22:13.031 --> 00:22:14.933
So about every seven years
I get a call

00:22:14.933 --> 00:22:17.102
from somebody in Hollywood
saying we are doing this movie

00:22:17.102 --> 00:22:18.837
and can we talk to you
about Robyn

00:22:18.837 --> 00:22:19.905
and what it was like
to be there.

00:22:19.905 --> 00:22:21.038
And I'd go out and
have these meetings

00:22:21.038 --> 00:22:22.406
and nothing would ever happen.

00:22:22.406 --> 00:22:24.208
So, when these guys
called this time saying

00:22:24.208 --> 00:22:25.810
we're making the movie.
It was sort of like, you know,

00:22:25.810 --> 00:22:28.713
crying wolf, okay, been there
done that 4,000 times already.

00:22:28.713 --> 00:22:30.048 line:0%
They said,
"No, we've actually cast

00:22:30.048 --> 00:22:32.450 line:0%
<i> this wonderful young actress
 Mia Wasikowska."</i>

00:22:32.450 --> 00:22:34.353 line:0%
<i> So this is a little trailer
 for the movie</i>

00:22:34.353 --> 00:22:36.321 line:0%
<i> and I want to just quickly
 show you, kind of,</i>

00:22:36.321 --> 00:22:37.622 line:0%
<i> some of the scenes</i>

00:22:37.622 --> 00:22:40.158 line:0%
<i> that they built
 on the still photographs.</i>

00:22:40.158 --> 00:22:41.726
<i> "Dear Sir</i>

00:22:41.726 --> 00:22:44.128
<i> I am planning to walk
 across the Australian Desert</i>

00:22:44.128 --> 00:22:46.197
<i> from Alice Springs
 to the Indian Ocean,</i>

00:22:46.230 --> 00:22:49.700
<i> a distance of 2,000 miles.</i>

00:22:49.700 --> 00:22:51.469
<i> And when people ask me
 why I am doing it,</i>

00:22:51.469 --> 00:22:53.772
<i>my usual answer is, 'why not?'"</i>

00:22:57.809 --> 00:23:00.879
<i> Your plan is ridiculous.</i>

00:23:00.879 --> 00:23:03.381
( dramatic music plays )

00:23:03.381 --> 00:23:05.449
<i> You must be mad, girlie.</i>

00:23:05.449 --> 00:23:07.552
<i> You know it's about
 2,000 miles,</i>

00:23:07.552 --> 00:23:10.455
six months of hard walkin'.

00:23:10.455 --> 00:23:12.690
You want to die out there
or something?

00:23:12.690 --> 00:23:14.926
( dramatic music continues )

00:23:39.985 --> 00:23:41.086
Leave us alone!

00:23:53.331 --> 00:23:54.666
Go away!

00:23:56.468 --> 00:23:57.935
I am so alone.

00:23:57.935 --> 00:23:59.103
We all are.

00:23:59.103 --> 00:24:02.174
( dramatic music continues )

00:24:12.283 --> 00:24:13.485
( applause )

00:24:13.485 --> 00:24:15.219
Thank you all very much.
Thank you.

00:24:15.219 --> 00:24:17.355
( applause )

00:24:17.355 --> 00:24:20.225
( outro music )
