00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:10.360
Why Coke Tried to Switch to New Coke

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:14.810
It turns out there was actually (if you squint
at the problem hard enough), a semi-good reason

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:18.942
for doing the switch. It didn’t work out,
of course… But then, it kind of did work

00:00:18.942 --> 00:00:22.449
out amazingly well at the same time, as you’ll
soon see.

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:26.529
Now, before I get into the real reason for
the switch, let me debunk the conspiracy theory-

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:31.269
that Coca-Cola was trying to swindle people
into accepting high fructose corn syrup over

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:35.701
sugar in their drink by pulling the New Coke
stunt. The truth of the matter is that they’d

00:00:35.701 --> 00:00:41.020
already allowed bottlers to use high fructose
corn syrup in Coke for about five years before

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:43.560
they introduced New Coke (before they even
thought up the idea to make a New Coke). Most

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:48.000
made the switch pretty quickly because of
the drastic cost savings. Initially Coca-Cola

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.710
allowed a 50% corn syrup substitution and
by about 6 months before the introduction

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:58.210
of New Coke, nearly every major bottler of
Coca-Cola was using 100% high fructose corn

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:02.720
syrup, rather than sugar or a mixture of the
two. So those who claimed they could taste

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:07.380
a difference because of the high fructose
corn syrup after the return of the old Coca-Cola,

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.050
actually had already been drinking it with
high fructose corn syrup, in most cases long

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:13.090
before New Coke.

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.910
Now, Coca-Cola did consider not announcing
that they were switching to New Coke, with

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:21.570
a plan to just very gradually change the flavor.
But they ended up deciding that it was too

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.330
risky, because if someone noticed, it might
become a huge news story and hurt sales from

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:27.570
the bad publicity of trying to trick their
customers.

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.409
So what really was the motivation for switching
to New Coke? Coke had steadily been losing

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:38.440
ground to Pepsi and by the early 1980s, taste
tests done by Coca-Cola and Pepsi showed that

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:43.650
most people tested preferred Pepsi over Coke.
Further, if not for Coke’s exclusive contracts

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:48.320
with many restaurants and vending machine
vendors, Pepsi would have been drastically

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:53.500
outselling Coke, as it was in supermarkets
and other locations where people had a choice.

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.560
Coca-Cola, thus, set about changing their
formula to come up with something people would

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:03.210
prefer over the original Coke and Pepsi. Specifically,
they created New Coke based on their Diet

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.670
Coke formula. Diet Coke was extremely popular
right from its debut (rocketing up to the

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:12.850
third most popular cola after Pepsi and Coke
within just a few years of its debut), even

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:15.950
though it was a new flavor and not a drink
flavor based on regular Coke, as the name

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:17.080
seems to imply.

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:21.670
Thus, as taste tests showed that more people
preferred the taste of Diet Coke to regular

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:26.490
Coke, they decided to primarily just take
out the artificial sweeteners in Diet Coke

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:31.190
and substituted in high fructose corn syrup.
With a few more minor modifications, they

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:34.310
succeeded in creating a new apparently tasty
drink.

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:38.489
This wasn’t a case of them not doing their
due diligence on whether it was better than

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:42.620
the original Coca-Cola. They knew full well
how big of a thing it would be to abandon

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:48.310
their old formulation. As such, they ran numerous
tests which showed the vast majority of people

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:53.900
preferred the new formulation over the old
and it also beat out Pepsi by a decent margin.

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:58.440
What went wrong is still partially up for
debate, but the heart of the issue is basically

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:03.290
the “nostalgia” factor and that they’d
spent nearly a century marketing their product

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:08.930
as something you can’t live without, then
they took it away. People had apparently taken

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:14.870
this message to heart. While the taste tests
made New Coke look great, they never explicitly

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:20.340
asked the question in any of their tests “Would
you care if we switched in this new formulation

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.470
of Coke and got rid of the old?” They didn’t
do this because they didn’t want people

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:29.200
to know they were developing a new formulation
at all. They did ask a a very similar question

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:33.190
that subtly implied the previous question
and the result should have clued them in to

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:38.100
the dissent. They asked tasters who had liked
it, “Would you buy this [new flavor] if

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:43.810
it were Coca-Cola?” While the majority said
yes, about 10% said no and got angry about

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:48.860
the subtle implication of getting rid of Coke.
While this is a small percentage, the problem

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:55.379
ahead was illustrated in that these 10% were
very vocal about their dissent and had a tendency

00:03:55.379 --> 00:03:59.860
to try to convince other testers that they
should switch their answer to “no” too,

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:00.860
often successfully.

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:05.070
This is exactly how it played out when New
Coke was introduced as well. At first, sales

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:10.140
were up a significant amount over the previous
year, even more than Coca-Cola expected; and

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:15.180
according to surveys run by Coca-Cola, most
people preferred the new flavor over the old.

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:19.350
Just as importantly, the majority of existing
Coke drinkers continued to buy Coke at the

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:23.650
same levels as they did before. Further, most
of those few customers they lost weren’t

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:27.820
switching to Pepsi, they were simply just
not drinking Coke anymore. Coca-Cola stock

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:30.630
went up and things were looking really good.

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:35.560
But then the vocal minority started kicking
up their heels- complaints trickled in and

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:39.901
the angered Coke fans started enlisting the
aid of the media; soon that trickle started

00:04:39.901 --> 00:04:44.780
to develop into a flood. One man, Gay Mullins,
even started the Old Cola Drinkers of America

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:49.300
organization to lobby for the return of the
Old Coke, or at the least try to get Coca-Cola

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:53.620
to license out the formula to someone else.
The fact that in blind taste tests Mullins

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:58.620
himself picked New Coke over Old Coke didn’t
stop him from attempting to sue Coca-Cola

00:04:58.620 --> 00:04:59.890
over the switch either, and continue his campaign.

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:04.000
The dissenters started convincing others,
many who had never even tried New Coke decided

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.251
they hated it before even tasting it, primarily
because they were upset at the fact that the

00:05:08.251 --> 00:05:13.699
original Coke was no longer available. Finally,
just three months after New Coke was introduced,

00:05:13.699 --> 00:05:18.479
the public outcry forced Coca-Cola to release
the old formula under the name “Coca-Cola

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:19.479
Classic”.

00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:24.440
So why did they get rid of Coca-Cola “Classic”
in the first place, rather than just introducing

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:28.860
New Coke as a separate drink right off the
bat? There were a few reasons, but the big

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:33.600
one was because the market for cola drinks
at the time was shrinking fast and by introducing

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:38.101
another Coke substitute (having introduced
Diet Coke in 1982), they feared (rightly so)

00:05:38.101 --> 00:05:41.550
it would split the market for their product
with many people who would have drank Coca-Cola

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:45.919
Classic now drinking New Coke. This would
allow Pepsi to take the top spot by a good

00:05:45.919 --> 00:05:51.180
margin, allowing Pepsi to not only claim taste
tests showed people preferred Pepsi, but also

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:56.400
to boast about how Pepsi was the most popular
soft drink in the world. Coca-Cola was unwilling

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:01.400
to give this marketing advantage to Pepsi,
so decided to get rid of the original Coke,

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:07.180
in favor of New Coke. After all, every test
they ran showed people preferred the new formulation

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:10.169
anyways. What could go wrong?

00:06:10.169 --> 00:06:14.650
Despite this switch not working out the way
they hoped, it did in the end work out amazingly

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:20.130
well. After this fiasco, Coca-Cola Classic,
instead of continuing its steady decline,

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:25.720
began to take back market share over both
Pepsi and New Coke. This was despite the fact

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:31.580
that when people were blind taste tested,
they almost universally picked both New Coke

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:35.960
and Pepsi as better tasting than Coca-Cola
Classic. (Although, some theorize that the

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:40.889
taste tests here are flawed because they often
only gave people small sips. Thus, the sweeter

00:06:40.889 --> 00:06:46.000
tasting Pepsi and New Coke would perform better,
whereas when drunk normally, might be too

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.639
sweet, and so Coca-Cola would win in these
cases. Those who theorize this is the reason

00:06:50.639 --> 00:06:54.930
for Coke losing out in the taste tests tend
to state that Pepsi’s steady rise before

00:06:54.930 --> 00:07:00.240
this fiasco was not due to superior taste,
but from their superior marketing, particularly

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:01.410
to youth.)

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:04.949
Whatever the case, while the whole thing was
a fiasco that nearly sunk the company initially,

00:07:04.949 --> 00:07:10.710
within 6 months of the return of Classic Coke,
Coca-Cola sales had risen at double the rate

00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:16.180
of Pepsi and it continued to climb. Thus,
the blunder ultimately was a huge part of

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:21.509
why Coca-Cola was able to reestablish itself
as the most popular cola in the world. Sometimes

00:07:21.509 --> 00:07:25.060
doing something stupid can really pay off.

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:29.660
Despite New Coke sales dropping like crazy
after the return of Classic Coke, when the

00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:34.770
Wall Street Journal in 1987 did yet another
blind taste test of Pepsi, Classic Coke, and

00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:39.389
New Coke, with most of the participants before
the test saying they preferred one or the

00:07:39.389 --> 00:07:45.090
other of Coke or Pepsi, New Coke won out as
the most popular choice again. Much like the

00:07:45.090 --> 00:07:49.139
New Coke dissenters, when the people were
told they’d picked New Coke as their favorite

00:07:49.139 --> 00:07:54.040
instead of their previous stated favorites
of Coke or Pepsi, rather than deciding they’d

00:07:54.040 --> 00:08:08.330
start drinking New Coke, they predominately
got angry at the testers.
