00:00:06.856 --> 00:00:12.167
Some of the world's most recognizable
symbols exist to sell products,

00:00:12.167 --> 00:00:14.316
others to steer traffic

00:00:14.316 --> 00:00:16.887
or advance political causes.

00:00:16.887 --> 00:00:20.766
But there's one whose main purpose
is to help people.

00:00:20.766 --> 00:00:26.616
You may know it as the wheelchair symbol,
or a sign for people with disabilities,

00:00:26.616 --> 00:00:30.397
but its formal title as maintained
by the ISO

00:00:30.397 --> 00:00:33.875
is the International Symbol of Access.

00:00:33.875 --> 00:00:35.494
But despite its familiarity,

00:00:35.494 --> 00:00:39.387
many people are unclear as to what 
the symbol actually means,

00:00:39.387 --> 00:00:44.246
which has a lot to do with the symbol
itself and the way it came about.

00:00:44.246 --> 00:00:49.038
In 1968, the International Commission
on Technology and Accessibility

00:00:49.038 --> 00:00:50.967
held a design contest.

00:00:50.967 --> 00:00:52.448
They were looking for a symbol

00:00:52.448 --> 00:00:55.617
that would be readily identifiable 
from a reasonable distance,

00:00:55.617 --> 00:00:57.108
self-descriptive,

00:00:57.108 --> 00:00:58.043
simple,

00:00:58.043 --> 00:00:58.928
practical,

00:00:58.928 --> 00:01:01.939
and couldn't be confused
with existing signage.

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:04.320
The winning design, 
which didn't have a head,

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.557
was created by a Danish designer
named Susanne Koefed.

00:01:08.557 --> 00:01:12.328
The addition of a head a year later
gave it a more human form,

00:01:12.328 --> 00:01:13.677
and within ten years,

00:01:13.677 --> 00:01:17.699
it was endorsed by both the United Nations
and the ISO.

00:01:17.699 --> 00:01:22.426
With minimal cost and minimal fuss,
a global icon was born.

00:01:22.426 --> 00:01:25.058
There have been a few tweaks
over the decades.

00:01:25.058 --> 00:01:29.038
The Graphic Artists Guild added more
rounded, human-like features,

00:01:29.038 --> 00:01:35.189
and in 2012, the Accessible Icon Project
produced a more dynamic version.

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.600
But what does it really represent?

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:38.889
What's its purpose?

00:01:38.889 --> 00:01:44.178
Put simply, it's a sign to identify where
there are accessible facilities.

00:01:44.178 --> 00:01:46.911
The strength of such an internationally
recognized image

00:01:46.911 --> 00:01:48.560
is that wherever you travel,

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.781
you don't need to speak the language
or have in-depth cultural knowledge.

00:01:52.781 --> 00:01:56.889
If you require an accessible toilet,
the sign shows the way.

00:01:56.889 --> 00:02:00.030
But the confusion comes 
from the term accessibility

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.141
and what that actually means.

00:02:02.141 --> 00:02:05.402
Many people assume that because
the symbol depicts a wheelchair,

00:02:05.402 --> 00:02:10.321
that accessible facilities are meant
only for people who use wheelchairs,

00:02:10.321 --> 00:02:14.221
or those, at the very least,
who have a visible physical condition.

00:02:14.221 --> 00:02:16.761
But accessibility is a broad concept

00:02:16.761 --> 00:02:19.471
that applies to many, 
many different conditions.

00:02:19.471 --> 00:02:21.219
That includes people with autism,

00:02:21.219 --> 00:02:22.592
visual impairments,

00:02:22.592 --> 00:02:24.232
and autoimmune diseases,

00:02:24.232 --> 00:02:27.032
like lupus, which can cause 
pain and fatigue,

00:02:27.032 --> 00:02:29.332
along with many other conditions.

00:02:29.332 --> 00:02:32.012
In fact, the World Health 
Organization estimates

00:02:32.012 --> 00:02:34.631
that there are approximately
1 billion people

00:02:34.631 --> 00:02:37.632
who experience some form of disability,

00:02:37.632 --> 00:02:40.943
which means that this group is very
likely to include yourself,

00:02:40.943 --> 00:02:42.230
or a family member,

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:43.192
a classmate,

00:02:43.192 --> 00:02:44.204
a friend,

00:02:44.204 --> 00:02:45.712
or a work colleague.

00:02:45.712 --> 00:02:49.583
And people who use wheelchairs only
make up about 65 million,

00:02:49.583 --> 00:02:52.623
or 15% of the total.

00:02:52.623 --> 00:02:56.323
The vast majority 
have non-visible disabilities.

00:02:56.323 --> 00:02:59.693
Accessible parking spaces, facilities,
and entrances

00:02:59.693 --> 00:03:03.552
are designed with 
that entire group in mind.

00:03:03.552 --> 00:03:08.183
So it's easy to see why in recent years
people have begun to raise questions

00:03:08.183 --> 00:03:12.434
about whether the symbol is really
appropriate for what it's meant to do.

00:03:12.434 --> 00:03:14.484
And it's not just about accuracy.

00:03:14.484 --> 00:03:16.686
It's common for people 
to become indignant,

00:03:16.686 --> 00:03:18.207
sometimes abusive,

00:03:18.207 --> 00:03:23.337
when they see people without visible
disabilities using accessible facilities.

00:03:23.337 --> 00:03:26.167
The symbol is unfortunately creating
widespread issues

00:03:26.167 --> 00:03:30.387
for the very people and families
it's meant to help.

00:03:30.387 --> 00:03:33.226
The recent redesigns have attempted
with some success

00:03:33.226 --> 00:03:36.268
to acknowledge concerns 
over the current symbol.

00:03:36.268 --> 00:03:39.878
But some think that a complete redesign
is in order.

00:03:39.878 --> 00:03:41.507
It's a difficult task, though.

00:03:41.507 --> 00:03:46.507
How do you replace a symbol 
that's familiar the world over?

00:03:46.507 --> 00:03:48.587
And what do you replace it with?
