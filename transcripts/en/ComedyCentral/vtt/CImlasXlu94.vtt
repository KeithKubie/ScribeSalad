00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.469
A good hair stylist
is indispensable.

00:00:03.502 --> 00:00:05.872
My guy Sean--
had him for 20 years

00:00:05.905 --> 00:00:07.240
we've been working together.

00:00:07.273 --> 00:00:09.742
He's the reason I look
like a dapper little hunk boy

00:00:09.775 --> 00:00:12.045
-instead of a raggedy dandy.
-(laughter)

00:00:12.078 --> 00:00:13.413
But one of the best parts

00:00:13.446 --> 00:00:16.549
of getting your hair did
is the hot goss that happens.

00:00:16.582 --> 00:00:18.217
Who's dating whom,
who's leaving whom,

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:19.485
who insists on saying "whom"

00:00:19.518 --> 00:00:20.720
'cause
it's grammatically correct

00:00:20.753 --> 00:00:22.422
even though it sounds
pretentious as (bleep).

00:00:22.455 --> 00:00:24.557
And nothing shows
this chitchat off better

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:27.026
than this adorable viral video
of a woman and her hairdresser,

00:00:27.059 --> 00:00:29.262
captioned "Salon Talk."

00:00:29.295 --> 00:00:32.331
And then I told him,
"Is you crazy?"

00:00:32.364 --> 00:00:33.933
Is you crazy?

00:00:33.966 --> 00:00:35.468
Girl, he kept it right.

00:00:35.501 --> 00:00:38.037
-Kept it right.
-Crazy.

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.939
Girl, I'm trying to tell you.

00:00:39.972 --> 00:00:42.075
-I'm trying to tell you.
-Ain't he crazy?

00:00:42.108 --> 00:00:44.177
-He crazy.
-Girl.

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.712
Girl.

00:00:46.745 --> 00:00:49.282
-(laughter, cheering, applause)
-Come on!

00:00:49.315 --> 00:00:51.617
Come on!

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:54.220
My ovaries just moved!

00:00:54.253 --> 00:00:56.255
(laughter)

00:00:56.288 --> 00:00:58.357
Right there,
she's giving Mommy an updo do.

00:00:58.390 --> 00:00:59.859
So, comedians,

00:00:59.892 --> 00:01:02.595
this mom didn't really
ask her hairdresser anything.

00:01:02.628 --> 00:01:04.964
So, as the next client
of this baby stylist,

00:01:04.997 --> 00:01:07.266
get the scoop on her life.

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:10.069
-DulcÃ©. -Girl, what's new
in your life, solid food?

00:01:10.102 --> 00:01:12.638
-Okay, I see you.
-(laughter, applause, cheering)

00:01:12.671 --> 00:01:14.173
Points.

00:01:14.206 --> 00:01:17.643
-Jon. -Girl, what do you do
to make your ass look so fat?

00:01:17.676 --> 00:01:20.942
Oh, you (bleep) your pants.
Awesome. That's great.
