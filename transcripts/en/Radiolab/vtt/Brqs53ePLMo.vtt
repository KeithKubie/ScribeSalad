1
00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:04.640
Okay. So here's how I got to you. Okay. I have a,

2
00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:09.320
a former producer and I now a good friend, Pat Walters. Oh yeah. You know pat?

3
00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:13.850
Yes. We corresponded. And then he came to see me speak in San Francisco. Yes.

4
00:00:13.851 --> 00:00:16.040
And it was based on something he saw you talk about,

5
00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:19.250
which is why I'm now contacting you. Interesting. Okay. So, Hey,

6
00:00:19.251 --> 00:00:21.350
I'm Jen [inaudible]. I'm Robert Krulwich.

7
00:00:21.351 --> 00:00:26.090
This is radiolab and today a story about a set of pictures. Pictures. Yeah.

8
00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:26.910
And a,

9
00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.890
a set of questions about those pictures regarding who gets to see the pictures

10
00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:33.080
and who gets to decide who gets to see the pictures.

11
00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:37.040
Did we get to see the pictures? Well, that's kind of the question.

12
00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.130
So I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna answer that yet. Um,

13
00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:43.220
but I w I should say that there are some moments in this story that get a

14
00:00:43.221 --> 00:00:46.940
little, what's the word? Heavy. Heavy. Yeah.

15
00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:50.180
So be forewarned, but we'll start with the picture taker.

16
00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:52.910
My name is Lindsay Adario and I'm a photojournalist.

17
00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:57.380
She's been covering war for the last 15 years. I've done military and beds,

18
00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:01.400
infantry units, patrolling, going in house to house searches.

19
00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.210
She's worked in well everywhere. Sudan, Libya, Lebanon, Pakistan,

20
00:01:05.211 --> 00:01:09.200
a million places. She's been kidnapped twice. She's won a Pulitzer, a MacArthur,

21
00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:12.440
and she's been called one of the most influential photographers of the past 25

22
00:01:12.441 --> 00:01:17.230
years. In any case, this particular story, can you set it up a little bit?

23
00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:18.420
Sure. Uh,

24
00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:22.510
so in December of 2009,

25
00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:25.450
she was taking pictures for Time magazine. She was in Afghanistan,

26
00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.520
Gazmere district, Helmand province,

27
00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:30.370
stationed at a base in the middle of the desert.

28
00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:35.360
I was embedded with the metabolic team and their role is to go in and pick up

29
00:01:35.361 --> 00:01:38.330
injured troops out of, uh, the theater of war.

30
00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.900
This is a small team of basically helicopter pilots, medics, doctors.

31
00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:43.880
Basically whenever there's an injured soldier,

32
00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.930
these teams are called whichever team is closest to the injured.

33
00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:52.040
We're talking like helicopter dropping into, oh yeah. I mean, this is fast,

34
00:01:52.041 --> 00:01:52.320
this.

35
00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.270
So Lindsay had been embedded with this team for a couple of days and not much

36
00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.751
what's happening?

37
00:01:56.751 --> 00:01:59.960
So you're just sitting around reading magazines and then rereading the same

38
00:01:59.961 --> 00:02:02.240
magazines and one night really late.

39
00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:05.990
But I think I was lying in bed and I was totally like if I wasn't asleep,

40
00:02:05.991 --> 00:02:08.720
I was on the verge of sleep. When they, someone ran was like

41
00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:11.670
there was an alpha.

42
00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.500
<v 1>Alpha is like Alpha means the most gravely wounded,</v>

43
00:02:17.501 --> 00:02:20.410
like you have seconds to get there. I mean it's life or death.

44
00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.070
So she grabs two cameras, her helmet and body armor runs out to the Black Hawk.

45
00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.560
I strap myself in and we take off.

46
00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:32.260
And I think it was about a two minute flight, which is so fast.

47
00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:37.210
And I remember I was shooting the fields as we flew in because I was trying to

48
00:02:37.211 --> 00:02:39.460
focus and see what I can see.

49
00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:44.590
Luckily they had lent me a set of night vision goggles, which was really nice.

50
00:02:44.591 --> 00:02:45.370
The military,

51
00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.680
cause you can't see anything without them in the middle of the night because

52
00:02:47.681 --> 00:02:50.890
they are using night vision. So they don't ever turn on the light.

53
00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.290
So if you were to look through the camera directly, you would see nothing.

54
00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:56.410
Just blackness, nothing. So what you do for photographers,

55
00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:59.980
you put the night vision goggles in front

56
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.030
<v 0>of the Camera Lens, so it looks green, it's fluorescent green.</v>

57
00:03:04.031 --> 00:03:06.130
Does that mean that the picture you get is green? Yes.

58
00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:10.240
So they fly for two minutes through the pitch black land, the helicopter.

59
00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:13.810
She has no idea where and everything is happening extremely fast.

60
00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:18.760
I'm trying to focus as I'm looking out the helicopter door and suddenly in my

61
00:03:18.761 --> 00:03:20.530
view finder, I see

62
00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:22.340
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

63
00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:27.200
<v 0>a man sort of wrapped. I think he was wrapped in a blanket and he's a,</v>

64
00:03:27.201 --> 00:03:31.880
he gets put right in front of me on the floor of that, of the Black Hawk.

65
00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:37.030
<v 1>The first thing I thought is I think he's already dead.</v>

66
00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:42.510
He seemed completely unresponsive and he seemed so young.

67
00:03:42.521 --> 00:03:47.110
I just remember looking at his face and thinking, God,

68
00:03:47.111 --> 00:03:50.830
what are we doing here? Within seconds there airborne again,

69
00:03:50.831 --> 00:03:52.420
flying back to the field hospital,

70
00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:54.640
Lindsey takes pictures on that brief flight back,

71
00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:58.750
grainy fluorescent green images of the medics tending to the soldier,

72
00:03:58.751 --> 00:04:02.360
checking his vitals. We land at the field office.

73
00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:02.890
<v 0>Well,</v>

74
00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:06.430
they rushed him on a stretcher into the hospital tent and the whole team of

75
00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:10.390
medics, navy nurses, the anesthesiologist, everyone is there.

76
00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:14.440
They carry him inside and put him immediately on the table. Uh,

77
00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:17.470
cut his clothes off, they're cutting his pants off, um,

78
00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:22.740
open up his shirt and the room starts filling up with everyone because everyone

79
00:04:23.111 --> 00:04:27.520
has heard that there's an alpha. And so troops come in from across the base,

80
00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:29.770
sort of in support. She says within minutes,

81
00:04:29.771 --> 00:04:34.180
the room went from just a handful of people, five, six to a dozen, 20,

82
00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:38.760
and it's a, you can hear a pin drop. I mean,

83
00:04:38.761 --> 00:04:43.080
the room is silent except for the doctors, you know,

84
00:04:43.081 --> 00:04:44.430
they're trying to resuscitate him.

85
00:04:44.431 --> 00:04:48.900
He had lost I think eight or nine pints of blood. They're bringing in blood,

86
00:04:48.901 --> 00:04:52.290
they're bringing in all sorts of things. And um,

87
00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:55.770
I you shooting this whole time? Well, yeah, of course. You know,

88
00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:59.970
I'm basically trying to be invisible because it's so sensitive to be a

89
00:04:59.971 --> 00:05:04.050
photographer in that situation. What I do, I don't shoot like Bang My,

90
00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:05.280
my [inaudible], you know,

91
00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:10.490
I shoot one frame and then I put my camera down and I shoot another frame

92
00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:15.180
because you can hear the click of the shutter and it is like exponentially

93
00:05:15.181 --> 00:05:19.650
louder than normal in a situation like that. What did you get? Did anyone look,

94
00:05:19.651 --> 00:05:22.320
give you a look of like, oh back off or anything like that?

95
00:05:22.321 --> 00:05:26.340
At one point I was shooting for probably, I don't know,

96
00:05:26.341 --> 00:05:28.050
five or six minutes maybe.

97
00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:32.340
And an officer walked over to me and he said, hey,

98
00:05:32.341 --> 00:05:35.790
stop photographing and yeah,

99
00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:40.020
and I put the camera down and I looked at him and I said, I have permission.

100
00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:42.300
She had worked all that out beforehand.

101
00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:47.040
<v 1>That's part of the conditions of her in bed. We had had all these conversations,</v>

102
00:05:47.041 --> 00:05:51.450
you know, what happens in the case of this, what is my access, what can I do?

103
00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:52.850
But at this point she says, ah,

104
00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:55.980
the room was full of people from across the base who didn't know any of that,

105
00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:58.100
didn't know who she was, that she had permission.

106
00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:00.500
And so she was sort of at this fork in the road.

107
00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:07.680
<v 0>There were those like that officer who clearly felt put the camera down. Stop.</v>

108
00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:11.340
Obviously this is not the time to argue or to be disrespectful.

109
00:06:11.341 --> 00:06:13.230
So I didn't say anything else. I put the camera down.

110
00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:17.280
But she says the moment she did that several other troops said no,

111
00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:22.300
<v 1>let her shoot. This has to be documented. Oh that's interesting.</v>

112
00:06:22.301 --> 00:06:26.410
So you have one guy who says, you can't take a picture of this. Right.

113
00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:29.410
Almost like anything but this. Right. And another guy's like, no,

114
00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:32.470
this especially right. Right. First of all,

115
00:06:32.471 --> 00:06:37.090
the guy who said no was being protective. It made perfect sense for me,

116
00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:40.480
but I think the guys who who stood up and said this has to be documented.

117
00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:44.440
I think at some point everyone realized like, look,

118
00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:45.910
this war is not going away.

119
00:06:45.911 --> 00:06:50.410
We are losing so many lives and limbs and and no one is seeing it.

120
00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:52.390
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

121
00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:53.021
<v 0>and keep in mind,</v>

122
00:06:53.021 --> 00:06:58.021
this is 2009 this is just the tail end of a 18 year ban where the news media

123
00:06:58.061 --> 00:07:02.590
couldn't even photograph military coffins. In any case,

124
00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:03.640
the officer let it go.

125
00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.430
Lindsay continued to take pictures for about another 20 minutes.

126
00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:09.280
She took pictures of the doctors cutting open the boy's chest,

127
00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:12.280
massaging his heart. At some point I remember someone,

128
00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:13.990
one of the doctors looked up and said,

129
00:07:13.991 --> 00:07:17.530
does anyone else have any suggestions basically for how to save him?

130
00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:21.790
And everyone said no. And they sort of disconnected.

131
00:07:21.791 --> 00:07:23.110
The Emini died.

132
00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:30.140
People were looking down and then they were looking at each other and someone

133
00:07:30.141 --> 00:07:33.860
went to go get a flag and American flag to drape over his body.

134
00:07:33.861 --> 00:07:37.850
And I continued photographing and there was a moment where, uh,

135
00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:43.210
the whole room was silent and people stood around his body draped with a flag

136
00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:45.410
and said a prayer.

137
00:07:47.130 --> 00:07:51.210
That to me is one of the most powerful images that came out of this whole

138
00:07:51.211 --> 00:07:52.044
series.

139
00:07:52.530 --> 00:07:57.450
There's this old idea in photography called the decisive moment that the world

140
00:07:57.451 --> 00:07:59.490
is filled with these far off realities.

141
00:07:59.491 --> 00:08:04.230
But every so often a photograph can capture a moment. The boom takes you there.

142
00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:07.020
This is one of those photos in the picture.

143
00:08:07.021 --> 00:08:10.530
You see all these men and women standing in kind of a loose semicircle.

144
00:08:11.010 --> 00:08:13.590
Some of them still have their, a blue surgical gloves on.

145
00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:15.600
They look totally spent.

146
00:08:15.930 --> 00:08:20.370
They're all looking in different directions and they all look like they're not

147
00:08:20.371 --> 00:08:23.640
even there. Like they're totally lost in their own thoughts.

148
00:08:23.910 --> 00:08:27.480
Their attention is clearly inwards. Yeah.

149
00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:31.890
I'm sure all those troops were like, God, that could've been me.

150
00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:35.550
Why couldn't we save him? What are we doing here in Afghanistan?

151
00:08:35.610 --> 00:08:36.900
Is this war wars yet?

152
00:08:37.050 --> 00:08:40.740
And to read the expressions on their faces like it's even,

153
00:08:40.741 --> 00:08:42.780
you can be at war as a journalist,

154
00:08:42.930 --> 00:08:46.770
but never actually get to the heart of the war because we don't have access or

155
00:08:46.771 --> 00:08:51.270
people don't open up. And I felt like I really had reached, oh,

156
00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:54.660
of like the crux of the war. Interesting. It was war.

157
00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:59.100
You'd seen an essence of something. Yeah, but then came a problem.

158
00:08:59.730 --> 00:09:04.110
Any photos that she had taken that included that soldiers face or any other

159
00:09:04.111 --> 00:09:05.760
identifying marks like tattoos.

160
00:09:05.761 --> 00:09:09.180
And he did have tattoos according to the rules of her bed.

161
00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:13.110
She couldn't use those photos without the soldiers permission. Right.

162
00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:17.490
And you never got to speak to him. No. So was it days later,

163
00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:21.310
weeks later, months later, where you began to ask yourself, can I, he knew,

164
00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:23.580
I taught. It was minutes later, it's,

165
00:09:23.581 --> 00:09:27.960
the military does not let a journalist cover something like this without coming

166
00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:29.340
directly to that person.

167
00:09:29.341 --> 00:09:34.341
And so literally like I followed the young man's body out to the morgue and they

168
00:09:36.371 --> 00:09:39.730
had to walk him outside. And I remember that it was,

169
00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:44.200
the moon was so bright that night and I was shooting with the moonlight as he

170
00:09:44.201 --> 00:09:47.030
was being carried outside. And then, uh,

171
00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:52.040
I went back to the tent where I was staying and within minutes of the Military

172
00:09:53.110 --> 00:09:58.060
Pao, the Marines, uh, public affairs officers came and said, uh, you know,

173
00:09:58.061 --> 00:10:01.570
you can't send those images out without permission from the next of kin.

174
00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:05.620
That's the rule for soldiers unconscious and then dies before giving permission.

175
00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:09.520
I have to then go to the next of kin. And I said, of course I understand.

176
00:10:09.730 --> 00:10:12.790
You know, I'm not doing anything with those photos in that moment.

177
00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:16.480
I signed this piece of paper. I, when I give my word, I keep that word,

178
00:10:16.481 --> 00:10:20.500
you know. But then the other side of me was like, fuck, you know, in Vietnam,

179
00:10:20.501 --> 00:10:24.910
no one was signing pieces of paper and in Vietnam, no one had to, to,

180
00:10:25.210 --> 00:10:27.760
to go to the next akin before they publish anything.

181
00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:29.890
And that's why the American public,

182
00:10:29.950 --> 00:10:34.150
I think rose up against the war in Vietnam because they saw the most graphic

183
00:10:34.151 --> 00:10:36.760
devastating images that were uncensored.

184
00:10:36.850 --> 00:10:39.340
So then what do you do in that situ circumstance? I mean,

185
00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:42.000
I imagine you go to the next of kin, right? Well,

186
00:10:42.010 --> 00:10:44.800
you're not allowed as a journalist to reach out to the next of kin.

187
00:10:44.860 --> 00:10:48.490
They asked me, are you interested in being contacted by the next of kin?

188
00:10:48.550 --> 00:10:52.150
If they're willing to speak to you. Oh, so you can't even actually call? No,

189
00:10:52.210 --> 00:10:55.810
they will not give you the information. But I said, um, you know,

190
00:10:55.811 --> 00:10:58.480
of course I would like to be contacted by the next of Canon,

191
00:10:58.481 --> 00:11:02.020
please pass my information on. And I was sort of just waiting.

192
00:11:06.130 --> 00:11:08.170
I mean at this point were you thinking the pictures would ever see the light of

193
00:11:08.171 --> 00:11:12.460
day? I had no idea. And um,

194
00:11:12.850 --> 00:11:16.900
few days later, maybe less than a week or in bed was over,

195
00:11:16.990 --> 00:11:21.250
she was flying to JFK on our way to meet her family for Christmas and I had

196
00:11:21.251 --> 00:11:22.510
voicemails on my telephone

197
00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:25.630
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

198
00:11:25.630 --> 00:11:27.790
<v 1>and I listened and it was his father?</v>

199
00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:30.150
<v 2>No,</v>

200
00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:31.890
<v 1>and he left me a voicemail and he said,</v>

201
00:11:31.891 --> 00:11:36.891
I understand you were with my son when he died and I would like to talk to you

202
00:11:37.411 --> 00:11:38.700
and this is my phone number.

203
00:11:39.570 --> 00:11:42.630
I sort of choked up just listening to his voice,

204
00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:45.270
anticipating how difficult that phone call would be,

205
00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:49.440
that phone call when all the fallout is coming up.

206
00:11:53.910 --> 00:11:54.743

207
00:11:55.430 --> 00:11:59.600

231
00:13:23.650 --> 00:13:28.090
<v 1>hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich. Radiolab. So Lindsey Addario,</v>

232
00:13:28.091 --> 00:13:32.230
the photographer has these photos, uh, these intense photos of a soldier dying,

233
00:13:32.231 --> 00:13:36.070
but you can't use them without getting permission from the next of kin. Right.

234
00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:41.230
Few days later I had voicemails on my telephone and I listened and it was his

235
00:13:41.231 --> 00:13:45.400
father. His father's name is Todd Taylor. Son's name was Jonathan Taylor,

236
00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:47.080
my son. And just to jump ahead for a second,

237
00:13:47.081 --> 00:13:51.190
as we were talking about the phone call and the fallout from that phone call,

238
00:13:51.191 --> 00:13:55.570
I had all of these questions about what Todd Taylor was thinking and questions

239
00:13:55.571 --> 00:13:58.140
about his son, things that Lindsay couldn't possibly the answer.

240
00:13:58.141 --> 00:14:00.840
So at a certain point in the universe, you just told me, I don't know. I mean,

241
00:14:00.841 --> 00:14:04.780
you could maybe interview on, do you think he would? I mean, is that, is that,

242
00:14:04.950 --> 00:14:07.610
is there any gray ambition of me talking to him? Well,

243
00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:10.590
I'd be happy to give you some. Yeah. Gee, I'd love to talk to you. I mean,

244
00:14:10.591 --> 00:14:11.424
you can try.

245
00:14:12.660 --> 00:14:15.330
Lindsey put us in touch and I'll just tell you about the visit for a second.

246
00:14:15.810 --> 00:14:18.510
Todd Taylor was willing to talk. He had two conditions.

247
00:14:20.940 --> 00:14:23.940
One was like, if I'm gonna do this story about these photos of his son,

248
00:14:23.941 --> 00:14:25.620
I should at least get to know his son a little bit.

249
00:14:25.890 --> 00:14:28.860
And the second was that I come down to Florida to meet him and his family

250
00:14:29.150 --> 00:14:31.080
personally. The destination is on your left.

251
00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:36.233
Hey,

252
00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:41.910
did you have a Taylor family live in a section of Jacksonville?

253
00:14:41.911 --> 00:14:44.640
It's near a naval base, so there are a lot of military families there.

254
00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:47.760
Come on in and read all the dog. Todd is x e x navy himself.

255
00:14:49.730 --> 00:14:52.460
He introduced me to his three giant boxers.

256
00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:56.750
<v 0>They sort of introduced themselves. And then my daughter,</v>

257
00:14:56.751 --> 00:15:00.860
my youngest dad met his daughters. I am Lauren Taylor.

258
00:15:01.070 --> 00:15:04.920
I am 16 going on 17 Oh oh it's about to add that.

259

My name is McKinsey Taylor. I'm Jonathan Zither sister and I'm 20 years old.

260
00:15:10.550 --> 00:15:13.280

261
00:15:13.281 --> 00:15:16.580

262
00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:20.400
My Name's Paige Larson and Jonathan stepsister.

263
00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:24.920
And I'm 21 my name is sue Taylor and I'm, I'm Jonathan Step-mom.

264
00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:25.860
And then of course

265
00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:29.240
<v 5>I'm Todd Taylor. I'm Jonathan's Dad. Um,</v>

266
00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:30.930
we're here in my house in Jacksonville,

267
00:15:30.931 --> 00:15:33.570
Florida and today is Jonathan's birthday. It's

268
00:15:37.530 --> 00:15:40.030
April 8th, 2015 so he would've been held today 28 years old today,

269
00:15:41.490 --> 00:15:42.323
<v 6>28</v>

270
00:15:42.940 --> 00:15:45.600
<v 5>when I got there, they pulled out photo albums of Jonathan.</v>

271
00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:48.310
We all sat at the kitchen table and looked at pictures,

272
00:15:48.870 --> 00:15:52.960
no pictures of them as a baby. So that was very young toddler.

273
00:15:52.990 --> 00:15:57.730
This was on the Disney cruise. I took him on adolescent Kennedy Space Center,

274
00:15:58.120 --> 00:16:01.870
teenager, see him running track. He like cross country going to prom.

275
00:16:01.930 --> 00:16:03.640
That was Jonathan's girlfriend.

276
00:16:03.930 --> 00:16:07.660
You think you notice immediately in all the pictures and big blue eyes,

277
00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:11.440
he's got these eyes that are not just blue. They're really blue.

278
00:16:11.740 --> 00:16:14.860
Like if you boosted the brightness and Photoshop or something. Yeah. This,

279
00:16:14.861 --> 00:16:16.810
I forgot. I think we're on vacation here,

280
00:16:16.811 --> 00:16:20.960
but the other thing you notice is facial expressions are really [inaudible] a

281
00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:24.220
big class clown. Lot of goofy faces.

282
00:16:24.270 --> 00:16:26.550
<v 0>Very good. Big goofball. Goofball. Yeah,</v>

283
00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:28.200
definitely knew how to make anybody laugh

284
00:16:28.270 --> 00:16:31.550
<v 5>full of energy. Always in the stuff. He kept the boys away too.</v>

285
00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:35.830
<v 0>Definitely most definitely made sure if I had boyfriends you'd call them just to</v>

286
00:16:35.831 --> 00:16:38.620
see what grades they had. Really. He would check on their grades. Yeah.

287
00:16:38.650 --> 00:16:41.950
Kind of give him a little interview. I do remember he was very protective.

288
00:16:41.980 --> 00:16:45.130
If I had a crush, he'd be like, oh no, you're not going to have a crush. No,

289
00:16:45.131 --> 00:16:47.890
no boys. There was one time before he left for Afghanistan,

290
00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:53.230
like I really sick with a fever and I remember him holding my hand just so he

291
00:16:53.350 --> 00:16:55.900
can make sure that I was OK and, and took care of me.

292
00:16:56.320 --> 00:16:59.170
They told me story after story about how he doted on his sisters,

293
00:16:59.380 --> 00:17:01.780
how we love to read and it to become a history teacher.

294
00:17:01.781 --> 00:17:05.680
After his four years in the marines and inevitably the conversation turned to

295
00:17:05.681 --> 00:17:08.860
the day that they found out he died December 1st,

296
00:17:08.860 --> 00:17:13.540
2009 they get a call from Jonathan's mom. I'm saying set classic scene.

297
00:17:13.990 --> 00:17:14.441
Oh my God.

298
00:17:14.441 --> 00:17:18.880
There were two marines at the door and we just kind of like left everything to

299
00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:22.360
Todd. The girls jumped in the car race over. They all wanted to get out.

300
00:17:22.361 --> 00:17:24.880
We're like, no, cause we didn't really know what was gonna happen.

301
00:17:24.881 --> 00:17:28.750
So we made all the girls stay in the car and I remember walking in the door and

302
00:17:28.751 --> 00:17:33.010
everyone just had this look on their face like the world had just ended.

303
00:17:33.660 --> 00:17:34.493
<v 6>And um,</v>

304
00:17:44.190 --> 00:17:46.080
I remember asking what happened.

305
00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:50.880
My mom had told me he was gone.

306
00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:57.720
[inaudible] the first thing I did was run to his room because everything was the

307
00:17:58.161 --> 00:17:59.690
same before he had left.

308
00:18:01.300 --> 00:18:06.230
I remember opening his closet and I'm grabbing one of his shirts and just

309
00:18:06.231 --> 00:18:08.540
holding onto it because it still had it sent on it.

310
00:18:12.590 --> 00:18:13.610
That night was really hard.

311
00:18:18.290 --> 00:18:21.800
<v 1>One thing that had never occurred to me, totally caught me off guard.</v>

312
00:18:21.830 --> 00:18:26.830
And in thinking about those pictures is that when those marines came to the door

313
00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:31.700
and told them the news, well,

314
00:18:31.701 --> 00:18:33.080
they didn't actually give much news.

315
00:18:33.180 --> 00:18:35.910
<v 5>This right here with this one. This is what was red.</v>

316
00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:38.990
<v 1>Todd actually read me the circumstances of death statement.</v>

317
00:18:39.660 --> 00:18:40.830
<v 5>Hostile action,</v>

318
00:18:40.831 --> 00:18:45.480
result of multiple traumatic injuries received as a member of a dismounted

319
00:18:45.481 --> 00:18:50.481
patrol that was struck by an id while conducting combat operations in the

320
00:18:50.611 --> 00:18:54.750
Hellman province. That was it on patrol night patrol,

321
00:18:54.810 --> 00:18:58.830
that's all I had. He didn't know anything. That's it.

322
00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:02.610
<v 1>Jonathan's unit was still in Afghanistan so he couldn't talk to anyone.</v>

323
00:19:02.611 --> 00:19:04.890
He had no clue what happened to his son.

324
00:19:04.891 --> 00:19:09.150
So when that casualty assistance officer told him actually there was a

325
00:19:09.151 --> 00:19:11.670
photographer in the room with your son, when he died

326
00:19:11.980 --> 00:19:14.320
<v 5>automatically I was like, I wanted to want to call her.</v>

327
00:19:14.990 --> 00:19:17.240
<v 1>Earlier in my conversation with Lindsey, I'd asked her,</v>

328
00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:18.800
what do you remember that the call?

329
00:19:19.090 --> 00:19:20.980
<v 0>So the call, um,</v>

330
00:19:21.130 --> 00:19:25.660
I went to my mother's house in Connecticut and I asked my mother to be left

331
00:19:25.661 --> 00:19:28.510
alone, which in a big Italian American family means

332
00:19:31.550 --> 00:19:34.230
she sort of looked at me like what? And I,

333
00:19:34.270 --> 00:19:39.270
I went up into the guest bedroom and I called him and he picked up,

334
00:19:40.780 --> 00:19:44.950
I think he thanked me for calling him. I don't remember exactly what we said,

335
00:19:44.951 --> 00:19:46.510
but I said, you know,

336
00:19:46.870 --> 00:19:51.870
I was with your son when he died and I will give you as much or as little

337
00:19:52.931 --> 00:19:57.490
information as you want. And he said, I want to know

338
00:19:57.610 --> 00:20:01.780
<v 5>everything because I wasn't there. I was here. He said,</v>

339
00:20:01.781 --> 00:20:06.310
I want to know every single thing I want to be with my son just to lose him and

340
00:20:06.430 --> 00:20:10.030
not be there for him. That was hard, really hard.

341
00:20:10.290 --> 00:20:14.290
And I felt sort of very awkward because I felt like, well, you know,

342
00:20:14.291 --> 00:20:19.210
why was I privy to this moment? Um, and he is, the father could not be privy.

343
00:20:19.270 --> 00:20:22.600
The most important question to me was did he suffer and do you think,

344
00:20:22.601 --> 00:20:26.710
did he suffer? I said, no. She told me, Ms. Taylor, I don't,

345
00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:31.060
I don't think you separate. I think he was in shock. I told him everything,

346
00:20:31.090 --> 00:20:34.900
how much blood his son lost. How long did they try to save him?

347
00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:38.500
And at some point I said, look, I have these pictures.

348
00:20:38.501 --> 00:20:40.360
I have all of these pictures.

349
00:20:40.361 --> 00:20:45.100
I shot everything and I need your permission to publish the ones that show his

350
00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:48.010
face. Oh yeah. She asked me a permission and

351
00:20:48.730 --> 00:20:49.870
<v 1>he was quiet.</v>

352
00:20:52.850 --> 00:20:56.840
<v 5>I said, um, I told her yes but, but</v>

353
00:20:57.100 --> 00:20:59.110
<v 1>he said, Aye. Aye Can I see them?</v>

354
00:21:00.070 --> 00:21:02.680
And I wanted to see him first before I give permission.

355
00:21:02.681 --> 00:21:06.610
I want to see every photo. And I said, you know,

356
00:21:06.670 --> 00:21:10.390
I'm not sure you want to see these photos cause they're graphic,

357
00:21:10.391 --> 00:21:14.140
but he wanted to see the outtake. He wanted to see every photo, all of them.

358
00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:17.140
Yep. Of course we were on the phone.

359
00:21:17.141 --> 00:21:21.730
I couldn't show them pictures and legally I needed permission from Time magazine

360
00:21:21.731 --> 00:21:26.110
to show him anything because you know as a journalist you can't show anything to

361
00:21:26.111 --> 00:21:27.580
anyone until it's published.

362
00:21:27.610 --> 00:21:30.910
You don't show people pictures of journalism before you publish them.

363
00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:33.280
This is one of those cardinal rules that's drilled into.

364
00:21:33.281 --> 00:21:35.410
Every journalist said if you show a subject,

365
00:21:35.411 --> 00:21:37.330
the raw stuff before it's out there,

366
00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:40.390
you kind of given up the only independence you've got.

367
00:21:40.450 --> 00:21:42.940
That's why she says ordinarily I would never ever,

368
00:21:42.941 --> 00:21:46.420
ever show just to play it out for a second if he to be cynical about it.

369
00:21:46.690 --> 00:21:47.830
If you show him the pictures,

370
00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:51.760
he might take away permission that he might've otherwise give you. Exactly.

371
00:21:51.940 --> 00:21:56.020
Exactly. You can say as a publication, no, I won't show those pictures before.

372
00:21:56.021 --> 00:21:57.460
You have to just say yes or no.

373
00:21:57.880 --> 00:22:01.690
What do you give your permission like in a way if you get down to it,

374
00:22:01.691 --> 00:22:04.660
I feel like one of the fundamental layers here is just like a question of who's

375
00:22:04.661 --> 00:22:07.720
right when it comes to that information is more important.

376
00:22:07.750 --> 00:22:11.290
I could hear an argument that's has the battle is important.

377
00:22:11.291 --> 00:22:13.090
It was authorized by public figures.

378
00:22:13.150 --> 00:22:18.150
It is carrying America's message into the world and shouldn't Americans see what

379
00:22:18.521 --> 00:22:21.070
goes on? Yeah, but I could hear an argument that says,

380
00:22:21.071 --> 00:22:25.830
shouldn't a dad be able to protect who sees his son in that situation? Yeah.

381
00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:27.970
In any case, Lindsey called her editors at time.

382
00:22:27.971 --> 00:22:31.210
They had a series of conversations that went all the way up to the editor of

383
00:22:31.211 --> 00:22:31.540
time.

384
00:22:31.540 --> 00:22:36.540
We had a very intense conversation and we collectively made a decision to show

385
00:22:37.361 --> 00:22:42.361
him the photos to say that decision was unusual from their perspective would be

386
00:22:43.061 --> 00:22:44.230
severely understating it.

387
00:22:46.570 --> 00:22:49.990
<v 5>When I first got these, um, from FedEx,</v>

388
00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:53.560
I knew they were coming and I was actually

389
00:22:55.150 --> 00:22:58.180
scared to look at them and I saw my son there

390
00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:03.580
and I just kept looking and looking.

391
00:23:07.580 --> 00:23:11.020
You can see these were the in the metabolic when they got him on.

392
00:23:11.690 --> 00:23:15.860
You see the Night Vision Lens? There's Jonathan's body. Hi, it's jazz.

393
00:23:15.861 --> 00:23:17.920
There's a space. There's the oxygen

394
00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:23.470
still as watch on stone. See his eyes closed there. That was, yeah,

395
00:23:24.310 --> 00:23:28.750
so many hands in the work and you can see they're doing CPR there

396
00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:31.930
now.

397
00:23:31.930 --> 00:23:36.930
Here you see right leg is really mangled and broken.

398
00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:41.680
That's really why I lost so much blood. It was this. All right in here.

399
00:23:41.770 --> 00:23:44.830
Some of these pictures are there. Some of them that are really hard to see.

400
00:23:44.870 --> 00:23:45.703
Yeah,

401
00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:50.750
but even though they show that I've messed up war,

402
00:23:52.580 --> 00:23:56.930
I've got a piece of Jonathan. This is my treasure.

403
00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:02.840
I'll show you one of the pictures that to me it's,

404
00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:06.710
it always stands out. You brought up the picture of the prayer.

405
00:24:07.460 --> 00:24:10.970
All those people standing in a semicircle with far away eyes run here.

406
00:24:11.630 --> 00:24:14.570
You just see a little different in their faces here. I mean

407
00:24:16.100 --> 00:24:18.830
it meant something. He was somebody.

408
00:24:21.850 --> 00:24:23.300
Yeah. It wasn't just a number.

409
00:24:25.100 --> 00:24:30.100
Dad said he wanted people to see this picture and the others to convey what's

410
00:24:31.430 --> 00:24:36.230
happening over there. This is going on every day. And he says for him,

411
00:24:36.231 --> 00:24:37.130
it's not a political thing.

412
00:24:37.190 --> 00:24:39.230
You can feel however you want to feel about the wars we're in.

413
00:24:40.010 --> 00:24:44.600
For him it's about people seeing what is actually happening. I mean,

414
00:24:44.601 --> 00:24:49.230
I wanted to let people see in the sacrifices that these boys do it too.

415
00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:52.620
<v 1>Todd and his family over a month to decide what to do about those pictures,</v>

416
00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:56.310
whether it grant time, permission to run the photos or not.

417
00:24:56.580 --> 00:24:58.680
He says ultimately he called Jonathan's mother over

418
00:24:58.760 --> 00:25:02.720
<v 5>her and her husband and um, my wife and I,</v>

419
00:25:03.110 --> 00:25:08.110
we all discussed it and ultimately he said no,

420
00:25:10.030 --> 00:25:14.260
<v 1>and it was a lot of back and forth. He said no to showing any pictures at all.</v>

421
00:25:14.500 --> 00:25:17.190
Well, he can't say no to any pictures because, oh,

422
00:25:17.610 --> 00:25:19.600
because there's pictures without the face. Yeah, exactly.

423
00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:23.230
He said no to any pictures with the face or identifying marks.

424
00:25:23.310 --> 00:25:27.570
<v 5>We decided really that, uh, we didn't want these pictures to get out, um,</v>

425
00:25:27.630 --> 00:25:30.900
for fear that his sisters, somehow they'd get back to them.

426
00:25:30.901 --> 00:25:32.340
And that was the big thing.

427
00:25:32.730 --> 00:25:35.460
I didn't want them to be able to see this yet as their dad.

428
00:25:35.461 --> 00:25:38.880
I want to protect them from seeing certain things. And so

429
00:25:40.830 --> 00:25:42.150
we decided not to do it.

430
00:25:45.250 --> 00:25:48.520
<v 1>Time had planned to run a whole photo spread on the Medevac team trying to save</v>

431
00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:52.630
Jonathan Taylor's life. But since they now couldn't use most of those photos,

432
00:25:53.500 --> 00:25:56.710
they had to make the photo spread more general. What had been the,

433
00:25:57.040 --> 00:26:01.270
basically the death of a soldier ultimately became a photo essay on the Mat of

434
00:26:01.510 --> 00:26:02.230
act team.

435
00:26:02.230 --> 00:26:07.000
And those pictures were maybe two pictures or three pictures in that spread.

436
00:26:07.001 --> 00:26:11.890
But they were not the focus prayer photo is in the news spread because in that

437
00:26:11.891 --> 00:26:14.980
photo you can't see his body cause it's covered with a flag.

438
00:26:14.981 --> 00:26:19.600
There are no identifying marks but somehow in that context it's,

439
00:26:20.470 --> 00:26:25.060
it's not got the same impact weirdly because you're seeing the after without the

440
00:26:25.061 --> 00:26:26.980
before. Exactly. And you know,

441
00:26:27.280 --> 00:26:28.420
<v 5>let's see here.</v>

442
00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:32.650
Todd showed me the original photo spread cause they had sent that to him.

443
00:26:32.770 --> 00:26:35.530
You know, again, super unusual. So this is the, um,

444
00:26:35.710 --> 00:26:38.890
this is the feature they wanted to do. Yeah. Let me see.

445
00:26:38.891 --> 00:26:42.850
The pictures are so much more clearer. This is kind of the layout.

446
00:26:42.950 --> 00:26:44.370
It's going to be to cock 29

447
00:26:44.370 --> 00:26:48.120
<v 1>minutes, crapping it out minute by minute. This whole process,</v>

448
00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:52.110
see there you see all the before pictures that lead up to the prayer and what it

449
00:26:52.111 --> 00:26:54.800
seemed to me, it's like if you don't see all that stuff, the the,

450
00:26:54.880 --> 00:26:59.100
the wounds and the blood and the tenderness as they tried to come from him and

451
00:26:59.101 --> 00:27:01.710
then the emptiness they feel when they couldn't save him.

452
00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:03.030
Like if you don't see all that,

453
00:27:03.690 --> 00:27:06.570
you're not really standing with them in that prayer at the end.

454
00:27:06.990 --> 00:27:10.290
You're still seeing them across the space. That's interesting.

455
00:27:10.530 --> 00:27:15.300
In the original spread, you are there in that room and they did a,

456
00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:16.890
they did a great job. You know,

457
00:27:18.770 --> 00:27:23.770
it's really powerful and I couldn't help but think that like maybe this would

458
00:27:24.230 --> 00:27:28.450
have created that conversation that Lindsay talked about just a tiny bit and

459
00:27:28.460 --> 00:27:30.680
like how weird that I'm one of the only people to see it

460
00:27:32.370 --> 00:27:33.210
and to know that like I,

461
00:27:33.390 --> 00:27:36.810
the only reason I can describe it to you is because I'm on the radio, you know,

462
00:27:36.900 --> 00:27:40.380
I will always feel like journalistically

463
00:27:42.040 --> 00:27:43.450
we, we sacrifice, you know,

464
00:27:43.451 --> 00:27:47.020
we did not tell the story as powerfully as we could have,

465
00:27:47.350 --> 00:27:52.090
but we had integrity and I feel like we treated everyone with respect and we

466
00:27:52.091 --> 00:27:57.091
kept our word Lindsey and Todd now stay in touch over email once or twice a

467
00:27:57.700 --> 00:27:59.530
year. And in terms of keeping your word,

468
00:27:59.560 --> 00:28:02.650
Todd has made a deal with his daughters that they can see the pictures when they

469
00:28:02.950 --> 00:28:04.900
turn 21 but interestingly, um,

470
00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:08.530
the three of them don't agree as to whether they want to Paige and McKinsey who

471
00:28:08.620 --> 00:28:11.800
are about to turn 21 say they don't want to see the pictures.

472
00:28:11.860 --> 00:28:15.550
I just can't handle it. Do you feel to feel sad? I think for me,

473
00:28:15.551 --> 00:28:19.960
I just don't want to see them in pain, you know, that's Mackenzie. So on the CA,

474
00:28:19.961 --> 00:28:23.350
cause I'd rather just remember him in one piece, how he was.

475
00:28:23.351 --> 00:28:28.210
I'm just too sensitive. That's Paige. Now. Lauren, the youngest for me,

476
00:28:28.360 --> 00:28:32.560
she says she needs to see those pictures because I want to know what he went

477
00:28:32.561 --> 00:28:32.891
through.

478
00:28:32.891 --> 00:28:37.891
And I like constantly knowing things and I don't like things being kept from me

479
00:28:40.590 --> 00:28:45.400
and I just wanna I guess I just want a visual. She says she knows he's gone,

480
00:28:45.401 --> 00:28:49.400
but she's still somehow needs proof. Not that it happened,

481
00:28:49.401 --> 00:28:52.570
she knows it happened, but so it feels real.

482
00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:17.660
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

483
00:29:17.660 --> 00:29:22.640
<v 1>okay. So, um, big thanks to Pat Walters. Um, cure Pollock,</v>

484
00:29:23.110 --> 00:29:27.860
the Taylor family and of course Lindsay Adario, she has a book out now called,

485
00:29:27.890 --> 00:29:28.940
it's what I do,

486
00:29:29.750 --> 00:29:33.110
which is sort of a memoir about her war photography and how it's changed her

487
00:29:33.111 --> 00:29:36.260
life. And uh, that book is filled with her photography.

488
00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:39.050
Anything like the ones we didn't see. Oh,

489
00:29:39.051 --> 00:29:41.750
there's some amazing pictures in there, but nothing like, like these ones.

490
00:29:42.740 --> 00:29:46.790
So yeah, that's it. I'm Jana. Boom. Ron, I remember crow,

491
00:29:46.791 --> 00:29:47.930
which thanks for listening.
