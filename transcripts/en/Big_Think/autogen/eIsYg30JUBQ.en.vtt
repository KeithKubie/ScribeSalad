Berkeley and I'm here to talk to you

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:04.230
Berkeley and I'm here to talk to you
 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:06.320
Berkeley and I'm here to talk to you
about words here and interface for

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:06.330
about words here and interface for
 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.690
about words here and interface for
exploring language use in literary texts

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700
exploring language use in literary texts
 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.430
exploring language use in literary texts
and so now you might be wondering what's

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440
and so now you might be wondering what's
 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.610
and so now you might be wondering what's
so interesting about literary texts well

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620
so interesting about literary texts well
 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.160
so interesting about literary texts well
the questions that literary scholars ask

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170
the questions that literary scholars ask
 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.609
the questions that literary scholars ask
of texts are really deep and really

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:18.619
of texts are really deep and really
 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:20.990
of texts are really deep and really
complicated and it takes them a long

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000
complicated and it takes them a long
 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.009
complicated and it takes them a long
time to get answers for our project I

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019
time to get answers for our project I
 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.109
time to get answers for our project I
teamed up with Brian Wagner at UC

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119
teamed up with Brian Wagner at UC
 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:28.580
teamed up with Brian Wagner at UC
Berkeley and Brian is studying the

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590
Berkeley and Brian is studying the
 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:29.990
Berkeley and Brian is studying the
collection of North American slave

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000
collection of North American slave
 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.840
collection of North American slave
narratives these are stories of escaped

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850
narratives these are stories of escaped
 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.610
narratives these are stories of escaped
former slaves and they're published by

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620
former slaves and they're published by
 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.440
former slaves and they're published by
white abolitionists and what Brian is

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450
white abolitionists and what Brian is
 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.750
white abolitionists and what Brian is
interested in is characterizing them in

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760
interested in is characterizing them in
 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.020
interested in is characterizing them in
typifying them and so a question that he

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030
typifying them and so a question that he
 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.569
typifying them and so a question that he
might be interested in answering is what

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579
might be interested in answering is what
 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.610
might be interested in answering is what
relationship did slaves have with God

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620
relationship did slaves have with God
 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.130
relationship did slaves have with God
and this is a complicated deep question

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140
and this is a complicated deep question
 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.479
and this is a complicated deep question
because to understand it you have to

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489
because to understand it you have to
 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:51.590
because to understand it you have to
really have a sense of the entire

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600
really have a sense of the entire
 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.110
really have a sense of the entire
collection and you have to get the

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120
collection and you have to get the
 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.720
collection and you have to get the
answers to what did God do how is God

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730
answers to what did God do how is God
 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.599
answers to what did God do how is God
described unfortunately getting the

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609
described unfortunately getting the
 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.340
described unfortunately getting the
answer this question currently takes a

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350
answer this question currently takes a
 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:02.630
answer this question currently takes a
long time and that's because the state

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640
long time and that's because the state
 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.820
long time and that's because the state
of the art and answering it is to use a

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830
of the art and answering it is to use a
 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.609
of the art and answering it is to use a
graduate student and so you you pay or

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619
graduate student and so you you pay or
 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.520
graduate student and so you you pay or
you don't pay this graduate student to

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:09.530
you don't pay this graduate student to
 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:11.960
you don't pay this graduate student to
read all the narratives really closely

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970
read all the narratives really closely
 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.450
read all the narratives really closely
find passages that deal with the

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460
find passages that deal with the
 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.130
find passages that deal with the
relationship between slaves and God and

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140
relationship between slaves and God and
 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.289
relationship between slaves and God and
then form a hypothesis and gather

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299
then form a hypothesis and gather
 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.929
then form a hypothesis and gather
evidence to convince you so there's

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939
evidence to convince you so there's
 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.940
evidence to convince you so there's
clearly a potential for search to speed

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950
clearly a potential for search to speed
 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.800
clearly a potential for search to speed
up this process we can digitize the

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810
up this process we can digitize the
 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.899
up this process we can digitize the
entire collection and index it and so

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909
entire collection and index it and so
 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:27.950
entire collection and index it and so
instead of stumbling around the

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960
instead of stumbling around the
 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.749
instead of stumbling around the
narratives looking for passages to deal

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759
narratives looking for passages to deal
 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.940
narratives looking for passages to deal
with God the graduate student can just

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950
with God the graduate student can just
 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.399
with God the graduate student can just
search for them and so that turns it up

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409
search for them and so that turns it up
 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:35.780
search for them and so that turns it up
it's actually an option for this

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790
it's actually an option for this
 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.460
it's actually an option for this
collection because it was digitized by

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470
collection because it was digitized by
 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:38.870
collection because it was digitized by
the University of North Carolina and

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880
the University of North Carolina and
 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.830
the University of North Carolina and
they put it on a website and so we can

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840
they put it on a website and so we can
 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.690
they put it on a website and so we can
go to a search engine and search the

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700
go to a search engine and search the
 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.340
go to a search engine and search the
site we type in God and when we get our

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350
site we type in God and when we get our
 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.560
site we type in God and when we get our
search results we can ask you know what

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570
search results we can ask you know what
 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.810
search results we can ask you know what
did God do and how is God described and

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820
did God do and how is God described and
 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.550
did God do and how is God described and
stuff like that so here are the search

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560
stuff like that so here are the search
 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.590
stuff like that so here are the search
results and you can see that they're

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600
results and you can see that they're
 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.980
results and you can see that they're
actually all excerpts from the real

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990
actually all excerpts from the real
 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.330
actually all excerpts from the real
slave narratives so they're sort of

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340
slave narratives so they're sort of
 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.249
slave narratives so they're sort of
relevant but when you look at them kind

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259
relevant but when you look at them kind
 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.560
relevant but when you look at them kind
of closely they're not all relevant for

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570
of closely they're not all relevant for
 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:04.789
of closely they're not all relevant for
example the first one is only there

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799
example the first one is only there
 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.469
example the first one is only there
because God appears in the title and

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479
because God appears in the title and
 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:07.940
because God appears in the title and
many of them don't really have anything

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950
many of them don't really have anything
 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.619
many of them don't really have anything
to do with the relationship between

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629
to do with the relationship between
 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.089
to do with the relationship between
slaves and God and how can you blame it

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099
slaves and God and how can you blame it
 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:11.890
slaves and God and how can you blame it
really sir

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900
really sir
 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.089
really sir
and didn't really know what you were

00:02:13.089 --> 00:02:13.099
and didn't really know what you were
 

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:16.360
and didn't really know what you were
after either way though this is an

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370
after either way though this is an
 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.009
after either way though this is an
improvement than stumbling around the

00:02:18.009 --> 00:02:18.019
improvement than stumbling around the
 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:19.360
improvement than stumbling around the
entire collection instead of having to

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370
entire collection instead of having to
 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.089
entire collection instead of having to
read all the narratives closely you only

00:02:22.089 --> 00:02:22.099
read all the narratives closely you only
 

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:24.100
read all the narratives closely you only
have to read 37 pages of search results

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110
have to read 37 pages of search results
 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:25.899
have to read 37 pages of search results
and that's kind of an improvement right

00:02:25.899 --> 00:02:25.909
and that's kind of an improvement right
 

00:02:25.909 --> 00:02:28.149
and that's kind of an improvement right
so to get even a vague sense of what did

00:02:28.149 --> 00:02:28.159
so to get even a vague sense of what did
 

00:02:28.159 --> 00:02:30.640
so to get even a vague sense of what did
God do how's God described instead of

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650
God do how's God described instead of
 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.830
God do how's God described instead of
taking five months as would have

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840
taking five months as would have
 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:34.809
taking five months as would have
previously taken the graduate student

00:02:34.809 --> 00:02:34.819
previously taken the graduate student
 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:37.890
previously taken the graduate student
can now do it in maybe a week five days

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900
can now do it in maybe a week five days
 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.030
can now do it in maybe a week five days
but the graduate student still has to

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040
but the graduate student still has to
 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.610
but the graduate student still has to
spend a lot of time reading each page

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620
spend a lot of time reading each page
 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.369
spend a lot of time reading each page
that was returned and so why is that why

00:02:45.369 --> 00:02:45.379
that was returned and so why is that why
 

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:48.130
that was returned and so why is that why

is it that keyword search is missing

00:02:49.869 --> 00:02:49.879
is it that keyword search is missing
 

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:52.089
is it that keyword search is missing
here and the answer is that keyword

00:02:52.089 --> 00:02:52.099
here and the answer is that keyword
 

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:54.699

really aren't mysterious bags of words
sentences follow rules and they have a

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:03.709
sentences follow rules and they have a
 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:05.949
sentences follow rules and they have a
grammatical structure and for many years

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:05.959
grammatical structure and for many years
 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:07.569
grammatical structure and for many years
now it's been possible for computers to

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:07.579
now it's been possible for computers to
 

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:09.099
now it's been possible for computers to
look at that grammatical structure and

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:09.109
look at that grammatical structure and
 

00:03:09.109 --> 00:03:11.170
look at that grammatical structure and
automatically understand it so for

completely non-technical person can use
 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.879
completely non-technical person can use
this technology and because we're using

00:03:57.879 --> 00:03:57.889
this technology and because we're using
 

00:03:57.889 --> 00:03:59.699
this technology and because we're using
the grammatical structure of sentences

the grammatical structure of sentences
 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:02.710
the grammatical structure of sentences
we can vastly increase the precision of

and the great power of this sort of

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:58.000
and the great power of this sort of
 

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.090
and the great power of this sort of
technology is that just like that we've

know the sentence wouldn't get that kind

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:29.680
know the sentence wouldn't get that kind
 

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:31.440

next for this so what's next for this is
we want to actually do a research

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:37.930
we want to actually do a research
 

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:39.540
we want to actually do a research
project with these historians and

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:39.550
project with these historians and
 

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:42.000
project with these historians and
basically convince the humanities that

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:42.010
basically convince the humanities that
 

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:42.840
basically convince the humanities that
there's place for this kind of

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:42.850
there's place for this kind of
 

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:44.640
there's place for this kind of
technology in the humanities and by in

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:44.650
technology in the humanities and by in
 

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:45.960
technology in the humanities and by in
that process convince other people that

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:45.970
that process convince other people that
 

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:47.640
that process convince other people that
you know natural language processing can

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:47.650
you know natural language processing can
 

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:49.380
you know natural language processing can
actually help answer these really

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:49.390
actually help answer these really
 

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:51.210
actually help answer these really
difficult or researchy questions and can

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:51.220
difficult or researchy questions and can
 

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:52.950
difficult or researchy questions and can
help speed up the research process right

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:52.960
help speed up the research process right
 

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:54.660
help speed up the research process right
I wish you lots of success thank you

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:54.670
