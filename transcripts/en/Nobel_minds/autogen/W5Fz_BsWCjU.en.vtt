Esther at Michigan and so on anyway so I

00:03:42.809 --> 00:03:42.819
 

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:47.770
I'm going to tell you can be and can we

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:47.780
I'm going to tell you can be and can we
 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:50.709
I'm going to tell you can be and can we
blow this picture little bit bigger yes

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:50.719
blow this picture little bit bigger yes
 

00:03:50.719 --> 00:03:55.659
blow this picture little bit bigger yes
yes yes okay so I'm going ready to to

00:03:55.659 --> 00:03:55.669
yes yes okay so I'm going ready to to
 

00:03:55.669 --> 00:03:59.550
yes yes okay so I'm going ready to to
talk about my patient my patient about

00:03:59.550 --> 00:03:59.560
talk about my patient my patient about
 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:04.030
talk about my patient my patient about
extreme light so Donna gave you all the

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:04.040
extreme light so Donna gave you all the
 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:06.640

background how to build these high

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:06.650
background how to build these high
 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:08.589
background how to build these high
intensity lasers and so on you don't

00:04:08.589 --> 00:04:08.599
intensity lasers and so on you don't
 

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:12.699
intensity lasers and so on you don't
need much more than that okay and so but

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:12.709
need much more than that okay and so but
 

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:14.770
need much more than that okay and so but
I'm going to tell you what you can do

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:14.780
I'm going to tell you what you can do
 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:19.439
I'm going to tell you what you can do
with that okay because it's true that

00:04:19.439 --> 00:04:19.449
with that okay because it's true that
 

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:22.810
with that okay because it's true that
it's only only recently but we had this

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:22.820
it's only only recently but we had this
 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:28.450
it's only only recently but we had this
phenomenal in intensity available and so

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:28.460
phenomenal in intensity available and so
 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:32.680
phenomenal in intensity available and so
there is many new discovery shall be

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:32.690
there is many new discovery shall be
 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:36.909
there is many new discovery shall be
made okay so that's my patient all right

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:36.919
made okay so that's my patient all right
 

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:50.649
made okay so that's my patient all right
okay and so okay can maybe act okay I

00:04:50.649 --> 00:04:50.659
okay and so okay can maybe act okay I
 

00:04:50.659 --> 00:04:53.469
okay and so okay can maybe act okay I
can I can i yeah so everything like

00:04:53.469 --> 00:04:53.479
can I can i yeah so everything like
 

00:04:53.479 --> 00:04:56.260
can I can i yeah so everything like
Donna said everything and started from

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:56.270

yes and this one thing you know which

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:10.880
yes and this one thing you know which
 

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:16.240
yes and this one thing you know which
really strikes me about about light it's

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:16.250
really strikes me about about light it's
 

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:20.500

a variety of things we can do okay

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:20.510
a variety of things we can do okay
 

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:28.060
a variety of things we can do okay
and as after ash Kingdom sorry showed

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:28.070
and as after ash Kingdom sorry showed
 

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:31.210
and as after ash Kingdom sorry showed
but what you can do you know first thing

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:31.220
but what you can do you know first thing
 

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:34.120
but what you can do you know first thing
is maybe you can slow down at homes and

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:34.130
is maybe you can slow down at homes and
 

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:39.070
is maybe you can slow down at homes and
it's a very very interesting phenomenon

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:39.080
it's a very very interesting phenomenon
 

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:42.480
it's a very very interesting phenomenon
we have seen with tweezers and so on and

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:42.490
we have seen with tweezers and so on and
 

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:52.990
we have seen with tweezers and so on and
this it doesn't okay so people you know

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:53.000
this it doesn't okay so people you know
 

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.670
this it doesn't okay so people you know
used it intensively very successfully

00:05:57.670 --> 00:05:57.680
used it intensively very successfully
 

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:02.650
used it intensively very successfully
and trying to really use the light to

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:02.660
and trying to really use the light to
 

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:06.190
and trying to really use the light to
decelerate atoms and that led to the

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:06.200
decelerate atoms and that led to the
 

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:10.450
decelerate atoms and that led to the
field of quantum optics and called atoms

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:10.460
field of quantum optics and called atoms
 

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:13.990

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:14.000
and you have Steve Chu in the first row
 

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.600
and you have Steve Chu in the first row
here which got a Nobel Prize with

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:16.610
here which got a Nobel Prize with
 

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:20.980
here which got a Nobel Prize with
cohen-tannoudji and also Bill Phillips

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:20.990

and so but LEDs this this flag but we

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:25.010
and so but LEDs this this flag but we
 

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:29.409
and so but LEDs this this flag but we
cannot really slow down the atoms to

00:06:29.409 --> 00:06:29.419
cannot really slow down the atoms to
 

00:06:29.419 --> 00:06:35.440
cannot really slow down the atoms to
very very small times velocity very

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:35.450
very very small times velocity very
 

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:38.710
very very small times velocity very
important it's another way to say that's

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:38.720
important it's another way to say that's
 

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:41.950
important it's another way to say that's
it's a way or so to make it atoms very

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:41.960
it's a way or so to make it atoms very
 

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:44.920
it's a way or so to make it atoms very
cold and which temperatures you know

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:44.930
cold and which temperatures you know
 

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:47.110
cold and which temperatures you know
which are I think the coldest

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:47.120
which are I think the coldest
 

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:51.210
which are I think the coldest
temperature we can produce now okay now

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:51.220
temperature we can produce now okay now
 

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:54.310
temperature we can produce now okay now
the other thing you can do and this is

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:54.320
the other thing you can do and this is
 

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:57.400
the other thing you can do and this is
what is exciting okay you can do just

00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:57.410
what is exciting okay you can do just
 

00:06:57.410 --> 00:06:58.920
what is exciting okay you can do just
the opposite you can accelerate

00:06:58.920 --> 00:06:58.930
the opposite you can accelerate
 

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:04.150
the opposite you can accelerate
particles and and you can accelerate

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:04.160
particles and and you can accelerate
 

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:07.750
particles and and you can accelerate
particles like electrons for instance to

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:07.760
particles like electrons for instance to
 

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:09.790
particles like electrons for instance to
use a speed of light or very close to

00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:09.800
use a speed of light or very close to
 

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:11.020
use a speed of light or very close to
the speed of light

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:11.030
the speed of light
 

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:16.960
the speed of light
okay and and this led really to a new

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:16.970
okay and and this led really to a new
 

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:19.570
okay and and this led really to a new
field which we call whole atavistic

00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:19.580
field which we call whole atavistic
 

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:22.000

that light is relativistic of the
 

00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:33.790
that light is relativistic of the
definition almost and and so that the

00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:33.800
definition almost and and so that the
 

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:35.320

fact that we can now accelerate
 

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:39.580
fact that we can now accelerate
particles to the speed of light then led

00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:39.590
particles to the speed of light then led
 

00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:44.170

00:09:27.230 --> 00:09:29.680
audience because he liked me they
understood immediately that it was

00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:29.690
understood immediately that it was
 

00:09:29.690 --> 00:09:34.580
understood immediately that it was
something important for for

00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:34.590
something important for for
 

00:09:34.590 --> 00:09:37.840
something important for for
power increasing the power of lasers

00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:37.850
power increasing the power of lasers
 

00:09:37.850 --> 00:09:44.300

okay so now with this CPA technique what

00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:44.310
okay so now with this CPA technique what
 

00:09:44.310 --> 00:09:46.520
okay so now with this CPA technique what
is fascinating is we can really produce

00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:46.530
is fascinating is we can really produce
 

00:09:46.530 --> 00:09:48.950
is fascinating is we can really produce
very very high peak power and we are

00:09:48.950 --> 00:09:48.960
very very high peak power and we are
 

00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:51.650
very very high peak power and we are
going to use this high power I will show

00:09:51.650 --> 00:09:51.660
going to use this high power I will show
 

00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:54.230
going to use this high power I will show
you in a minute but just to give you a

00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:54.240
you in a minute but just to give you a
 

00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:58.370
you in a minute but just to give you a
sense the power of the peak power okay

00:09:58.370 --> 00:09:58.380
sense the power of the peak power okay
 

00:09:58.380 --> 00:10:01.910
sense the power of the peak power okay
if the light is in a paper in now it's a

00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:01.920
if the light is in a paper in now it's a
 

00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:04.190
if the light is in a paper in now it's a
new beta watt range okay which is about

00:10:04.190 --> 00:10:04.200
new beta watt range okay which is about
 

00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:07.250
new beta watt range okay which is about
a thousand times the total power of of

00:10:07.250 --> 00:10:07.260
a thousand times the total power of of
 

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:10.550
a thousand times the total power of of
the world Ward grid so global will do it

00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:10.560
the world Ward grid so global will do it
 

00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:14.090
the world Ward grid so global will do it
okay but of course for femtosecond you

00:10:14.090 --> 00:10:14.100
okay but of course for femtosecond you
 

00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:17.510
okay but of course for femtosecond you
know 10-15 seconds but nevertheless it

00:10:17.510 --> 00:10:17.520
know 10-15 seconds but nevertheless it
 

00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:21.940
know 10-15 seconds but nevertheless it
extremely important and if you take now

00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:21.950
extremely important and if you take now
 

00:10:21.950 --> 00:10:26.810
extremely important and if you take now
this power you know B's petawatt power

00:10:26.810 --> 00:10:26.820
this power you know B's petawatt power
 

00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:32.330
this power you know B's petawatt power
and you focus it like Donna said over on

00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:32.340
and you focus it like Donna said over on
 

00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:35.270
and you focus it like Donna said over on
a on a spot size which is a weapon for

00:10:35.270 --> 00:10:35.280
a on a spot size which is a weapon for

bright you cannot take off less than

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:38.010
bright you cannot take off less than
 

00:10:38.010 --> 00:10:40.520
bright you cannot take off less than
that so typically on me micrometers or

00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:40.530
that so typically on me micrometers or
 

00:10:40.530 --> 00:10:44.050
that so typically on me micrometers or
so then you get a fabulous amount of

00:10:44.050 --> 00:10:44.060
so then you get a fabulous amount of
 

00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:48.010
so then you get a fabulous amount of
energy density on a very small spot and

00:10:48.010 --> 00:10:48.020
energy density on a very small spot and
 

00:10:48.020 --> 00:10:50.930
energy density on a very small spot and
this is of course you know lead is

00:10:50.930 --> 00:10:50.940
this is of course you know lead is
 

00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:53.300
this is of course you know lead is
leading to absolutely new application

00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:53.310
leading to absolutely new application
 

00:10:53.310 --> 00:10:57.760
leading to absolutely new application
just to give you an idea okay light like

00:10:57.760 --> 00:10:57.770
just to give you an idea okay light like
 

00:10:57.770 --> 00:11:02.120
just to give you an idea okay light like
the first picture showed and outer

00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:02.130

you can really produce pressures which

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:23.610
you can really produce pressures which
 

00:11:23.610 --> 00:11:27.050
you can really produce pressures which
is correspond to about ten millions FL

00:11:27.050 --> 00:11:27.060
is correspond to about ten millions FL
 

00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:30.860

like Donna said you know you are

00:12:13.699 --> 00:12:13.709
like Donna said you know you are
 

00:12:13.709 --> 00:12:16.699
like Donna said you know you are
damaging you if you go higher you are

00:12:16.699 --> 00:12:16.709
damaging you if you go higher you are
 

00:12:16.709 --> 00:12:20.060

to prevent Donna making mistake I said

00:12:47.750 --> 00:12:47.760
to prevent Donna making mistake I said
 

00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:50.990
to prevent Donna making mistake I said
well if you know that's not the way to

00:12:50.990 --> 00:12:51.000
well if you know that's not the way to
 

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.420
well if you know that's not the way to
do it let's do it this way okay let's

00:12:53.420 --> 00:12:53.430
do it let's do it this way okay let's
 

00:12:53.430 --> 00:12:57.019
do it let's do it this way okay let's
try it let's invent so CPA okay so she

00:12:57.019 --> 00:12:57.029
try it let's invent so CPA okay so she
 

00:12:57.029 --> 00:13:00.199
try it let's invent so CPA okay so she
would learn try damage word anymore

00:13:00.199 --> 00:13:00.209
would learn try damage word anymore
 

00:13:00.209 --> 00:13:04.960
would learn try damage word anymore
okay so so we we did she build it and

00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:04.970
okay so so we we did she build it and
 

00:13:04.970 --> 00:13:08.960
okay so so we we did she build it and
the CPA and then we we cool really now

00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:08.970
the CPA and then we we cool really now
 

00:13:08.970 --> 00:13:14.329
the CPA and then we we cool really now
we are not limited by by the breakdowns

00:13:14.329 --> 00:13:14.339
we are not limited by by the breakdowns
 

00:13:14.339 --> 00:13:18.530
we are not limited by by the breakdowns
of material loss and but and we could

00:13:18.530 --> 00:13:18.540
of material loss and but and we could
 

00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:21.560
of material loss and but and we could
easily climb up now the intensities and

00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:21.570
easily climb up now the intensities and
 

00:13:21.570 --> 00:13:26.920
easily climb up now the intensities and
now I mean since we 85 when we did it

00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:26.930
now I mean since we 85 when we did it
 

00:13:26.930 --> 00:13:30.259
now I mean since we 85 when we did it
the intensity have to say I think reason

00:13:30.259 --> 00:13:30.269
the intensity have to say I think reason
 

00:13:30.269 --> 00:13:35.750
the intensity have to say I think reason
obviously okay eight or nine orders of

00:13:35.750 --> 00:13:35.760
obviously okay eight or nine orders of
 

00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:39.170
obviously okay eight or nine orders of
magnitude okay and it going to go

00:13:39.170 --> 00:13:39.180
magnitude okay and it going to go
 

00:13:39.180 --> 00:13:45.019
magnitude okay and it going to go
further up okay with with lasers like up

00:13:45.019 --> 00:13:45.029
further up okay with with lasers like up
 

00:13:45.029 --> 00:13:47.540
further up okay with with lasers like up
alone but is being built lasers which

00:13:47.540 --> 00:13:47.550
alone but is being built lasers which
 

00:13:47.550 --> 00:13:49.750
alone but is being built lasers which
which is part of the Eloi

infrastructures you know and Gary and

00:13:52.069 --> 00:13:52.079
infrastructures you know and Gary and
 

00:13:52.079 --> 00:13:58.639
infrastructures you know and Gary and
and home mania and and and crag and so

00:13:58.639 --> 00:13:58.649
and home mania and and and crag and so
 

00:13:58.649 --> 00:14:02.990
and home mania and and and crag and so
on so he's going up and as we are going

00:14:02.990 --> 00:14:03.000
on so he's going up and as we are going
 

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.889
on so he's going up and as we are going
up you know of course we are traversing

00:14:05.889 --> 00:14:05.899
up you know of course we are traversing
 

00:14:05.899 --> 00:14:10.189
up you know of course we are traversing
new regimes of physics so the first one

00:14:10.189 --> 00:14:10.199
new regimes of physics so the first one
 

00:14:10.199 --> 00:14:14.000
new regimes of physics so the first one
you know we and Donna said it you know

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:14.010
you know we and Donna said it you know
 

00:14:14.010 --> 00:14:16.090
you know we and Donna said it you know
we we started to really observe

00:14:16.090 --> 00:14:16.100
we we started to really observe
 

00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:19.550
we we started to really observe
multiphoton ionization differently and

00:14:19.550 --> 00:14:19.560
multiphoton ionization differently and
 

00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:25.460
multiphoton ionization differently and
so on and and and and observe what she

00:14:25.460 --> 00:14:25.470
so on and and and and observe what she
 

00:14:25.470 --> 00:14:30.019
so on and and and and observe what she
was saying I know I saw we climbed up

00:14:30.019 --> 00:14:30.029
was saying I know I saw we climbed up
 

00:14:30.029 --> 00:14:33.290
was saying I know I saw we climbed up
with this as we climb up with the

00:14:33.290 --> 00:14:33.300
with this as we climb up with the
 

00:14:33.300 --> 00:14:37.009
with this as we climb up with the
intensity when we go into relativistic

00:14:37.009 --> 00:14:37.019
intensity when we go into relativistic
 

00:14:37.019 --> 00:14:40.009
intensity when we go into relativistic
optics why relativistic optics because

00:14:40.009 --> 00:14:40.019
optics why relativistic optics because
 

00:14:40.019 --> 00:14:43.220
optics why relativistic optics because
for the first times you know when you

00:14:43.220 --> 00:14:43.230
for the first times you know when you
 

00:14:43.230 --> 00:14:46.610
for the first times you know when you
have when you can see something this

00:14:46.610 --> 00:14:46.620
have when you can see something this
 

00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:49.420
have when you can see something this
means that you have been you have

00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:49.430
means that you have been you have
 

00:14:49.430 --> 00:14:52.429
means that you have been you have
electrons with which are agitated and

00:14:52.429 --> 00:14:52.439
electrons with which are agitated and
 

00:14:52.439 --> 00:14:54.530
electrons with which are agitated and
because they are agitated they are

00:14:54.530 --> 00:14:54.540
because they are agitated they are
 

00:14:54.540 --> 00:14:58.130
because they are agitated they are
really move producing light which are

00:14:58.130 --> 00:14:58.140
really move producing light which are
 

00:14:58.140 --> 00:15:02.750
really move producing light which are
coming and spiking your eyes okay so but

00:15:02.750 --> 00:15:02.760
coming and spiking your eyes okay so but
 

00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:06.380
coming and spiking your eyes okay so but
in a case of when you are passing 10 to

00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:06.390
in a case of when you are passing 10 to
 

00:15:06.390 --> 00:15:08.689
in a case of when you are passing 10 to
be 18 watt per square centimeter or so

00:15:08.689 --> 00:15:08.699
be 18 watt per square centimeter or so
 

00:15:08.699 --> 00:15:12.439
be 18 watt per square centimeter or so
then what happened is now the electrons

00:15:12.439 --> 00:15:12.449
then what happened is now the electrons
 

00:15:12.449 --> 00:15:17.150
then what happened is now the electrons
in your atoms move by a large amount and

00:15:17.150 --> 00:15:17.160
in your atoms move by a large amount and
 

00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:21.439
in your atoms move by a large amount and
move at the speed of light so the

00:15:21.439 --> 00:15:21.449
move at the speed of light so the
 

00:15:21.449 --> 00:15:23.750
move at the speed of light so the
electrons not to light but the electrons

00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:23.760
electrons not to light but the electrons
 

00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:26.360
electrons not to light but the electrons
are really moving at the speed of light

00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:26.370
are really moving at the speed of light
 

00:15:26.370 --> 00:15:29.150
are really moving at the speed of light
so so that's what's very interesting

00:15:29.150 --> 00:15:29.160
so so that's what's very interesting
 

00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:32.150
so so that's what's very interesting
regimes you know which leads to a lot of

00:15:32.150 --> 00:15:32.160
regimes you know which leads to a lot of
 

00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:37.370
regimes you know which leads to a lot of
fact and and so on so now of course if

00:15:37.370 --> 00:15:37.380
fact and and so on so now of course if
 

00:15:37.380 --> 00:15:40.009
fact and and so on so now of course if
you are pushing this is what we are

00:15:40.009 --> 00:15:40.019
you are pushing this is what we are
 

00:15:40.019 --> 00:15:42.199
you are pushing this is what we are
trying to do now if you are pushing the

00:15:42.199 --> 00:15:42.209
trying to do now if you are pushing the
 

00:15:42.209 --> 00:15:44.509
trying to do now if you are pushing the
intensity up you know like we are trying

00:15:44.509 --> 00:15:44.519
intensity up you know like we are trying
 

00:15:44.519 --> 00:15:46.429
intensity up you know like we are trying
to do with Apollo in the eye and so on

00:15:46.429 --> 00:15:46.439
to do with Apollo in the eye and so on
 

00:15:46.439 --> 00:15:50.150
to do with Apollo in the eye and so on
the end you you go into the you travel

00:15:50.150 --> 00:15:50.160
the end you you go into the you travel
 

00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:52.670
the end you you go into the you travel
atavistic regime and this time it is

00:15:52.670 --> 00:15:52.680
atavistic regime and this time it is
 

00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:56.120
atavistic regime and this time it is
because not only the electrons don't can

00:15:56.120 --> 00:15:56.130
because not only the electrons don't can
 

00:15:56.130 --> 00:15:59.240
because not only the electrons don't can
be moved at the speed of light but also

00:15:59.240 --> 00:15:59.250
be moved at the speed of light but also
 

00:15:59.250 --> 00:16:01.939
be moved at the speed of light but also
the protons protons which are massives

00:16:01.939 --> 00:16:01.949
the protons protons which are massives
 

00:16:01.949 --> 00:16:05.780
the protons protons which are massives
are 2,000 times the the mass of the

00:16:05.780 --> 00:16:05.790
are 2,000 times the the mass of the
 

00:16:05.790 --> 00:16:09.439
are 2,000 times the the mass of the
electron so the Imam as if but a 10 to

00:16:09.439 --> 00:16:09.449
electron so the Imam as if but a 10 to
 

00:16:09.449 --> 00:16:12.530
electron so the Imam as if but a 10 to
the 25 or so what Pascrell centimeters

00:16:12.530 --> 00:16:12.540
the 25 or so what Pascrell centimeters
 

00:16:12.540 --> 00:16:13.550
the 25 or so what Pascrell centimeters
they move

00:16:13.550 --> 00:16:13.560
they move
 

00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:15.079
they move
the speed of light and that's going to

00:16:15.079 --> 00:16:15.089
the speed of light and that's going to
 

00:16:15.089 --> 00:16:18.439
the speed of light and that's going to
be very important when finally if we

00:16:18.439 --> 00:16:18.449
be very important when finally if we
 

00:16:18.449 --> 00:16:24.889
be very important when finally if we
push even the intensity even higher and

00:16:24.889 --> 00:16:24.899
push even the intensity even higher and
 

00:16:24.899 --> 00:16:27.259
push even the intensity even higher and
I won't say exactly how we're going to

00:16:27.259 --> 00:16:27.269
I won't say exactly how we're going to
 

00:16:27.269 --> 00:16:29.389
I won't say exactly how we're going to
do that Jonathan we are indeed in the

00:16:29.389 --> 00:16:29.399
do that Jonathan we are indeed in the
 

00:16:29.399 --> 00:16:32.389
do that Jonathan we are indeed in the
audience and can we can talk about it

00:16:32.389 --> 00:16:32.399
audience and can we can talk about it
 

00:16:32.399 --> 00:16:36.110
audience and can we can talk about it
but so we go into this regime where

00:16:36.110 --> 00:16:36.120
but so we go into this regime where
 

00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:41.540
but so we go into this regime where
light interact with vacuum okay like my

00:16:41.540 --> 00:16:41.550
light interact with vacuum okay like my
 

00:16:41.550 --> 00:16:45.619
light interact with vacuum okay like my
friend position says we are boiling the

00:16:45.619 --> 00:16:45.629
friend position says we are boiling the
 

00:16:45.629 --> 00:16:53.170
friend position says we are boiling the
vacuum okay we are really separating the

00:16:53.170 --> 00:16:53.180
vacuum okay we are really separating the
 

00:16:53.180 --> 00:16:58.579
vacuum okay we are really separating the
particles real particles and the article

00:16:58.579 --> 00:16:58.589
particles real particles and the article
 

00:16:58.589 --> 00:17:02.119
particles real particles and the article
virtual particle in vacuum and this is

00:17:02.119 --> 00:17:02.129
virtual particle in vacuum and this is
 

00:17:02.129 --> 00:17:05.689
virtual particle in vacuum and this is
what we can do and at this regime which

00:17:05.689 --> 00:17:05.699
what we can do and at this regime which
 

00:17:05.699 --> 00:17:07.819
what we can do and at this regime which
is ten to the twenty eight twenty to

00:17:07.819 --> 00:17:07.829
is ten to the twenty eight twenty to
 

00:17:07.829 --> 00:17:09.559
is ten to the twenty eight twenty to
twenty nine what Pascal Santa materials

00:17:09.559 --> 00:17:09.569
twenty nine what Pascal Santa materials
 

00:17:09.569 --> 00:17:12.399
twenty nine what Pascal Santa materials
okay and basically what we do is we

00:17:12.399 --> 00:17:12.409
okay and basically what we do is we
 

00:17:12.409 --> 00:17:16.549
okay and basically what we do is we
materialize the value vacuum okay anyway

00:17:16.549 --> 00:17:16.559
materialize the value vacuum okay anyway
 

00:17:16.559 --> 00:17:22.659
materialize the value vacuum okay anyway
so moving right along okay again so now

00:17:22.659 --> 00:17:22.669
so moving right along okay again so now
 

00:17:22.669 --> 00:17:26.960
so moving right along okay again so now
just one thing if we go back to the

00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:26.970
just one thing if we go back to the
 

00:17:26.970 --> 00:17:29.330
just one thing if we go back to the
regime's you know a ten to fourteen and

00:17:29.330 --> 00:17:29.340
regime's you know a ten to fourteen and
 

00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:33.710
regime's you know a ten to fourteen and
so on you know then we can really use

00:17:33.710 --> 00:17:33.720
so on you know then we can really use
 

00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:38.260
so on you know then we can really use
this time to Saigon lasers so we don't

00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:38.270
this time to Saigon lasers so we don't
 

00:17:38.270 --> 00:17:44.139
this time to Saigon lasers so we don't
add for instance to two micro machines

00:17:44.139 --> 00:17:44.149
add for instance to two micro machines
 

00:17:44.149 --> 00:17:48.020
add for instance to two micro machines
to remove to a blade material very very

00:17:48.020 --> 00:17:48.030
to remove to a blade material very very
 

00:17:48.030 --> 00:17:52.100
to remove to a blade material very very
precisely the reason is femtosecond

00:17:52.100 --> 00:17:52.110
precisely the reason is femtosecond
 

00:17:52.110 --> 00:17:55.549
precisely the reason is femtosecond
laser are so good for that is because if

00:17:55.549 --> 00:17:55.559
laser are so good for that is because if
 

00:17:55.559 --> 00:17:57.230
laser are so good for that is because if
you are using for me number continuous

00:17:57.230 --> 00:17:57.240
you are using for me number continuous
 

00:17:57.240 --> 00:17:59.210
you are using for me number continuous
laser and you're shining the continuous

00:17:59.210 --> 00:17:59.220
laser and you're shining the continuous
 

00:17:59.220 --> 00:18:03.560
laser and you're shining the continuous
lasers on the on the on a target then

00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:03.570
lasers on the on the on a target then
 

00:18:03.570 --> 00:18:05.930
lasers on the on the on a target then
you are going finally to heat to all

00:18:05.930 --> 00:18:05.940
you are going finally to heat to all
 

00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:08.330
you are going finally to heat to all
volumes of the targets so you cannot

00:18:08.330 --> 00:18:08.340
volumes of the targets so you cannot
 

00:18:08.340 --> 00:18:10.789
volumes of the targets so you cannot
really micro machine with that now if

00:18:10.789 --> 00:18:10.799
really micro machine with that now if
 

00:18:10.799 --> 00:18:14.180
really micro machine with that now if
you are using pulses which are much

00:18:14.180 --> 00:18:14.190
you are using pulses which are much
 

00:18:14.190 --> 00:18:18.130
you are using pulses which are much
shorter nanosecond me nanosecond layton

00:18:18.130 --> 00:18:18.140
shorter nanosecond me nanosecond layton
 

00:18:18.140 --> 00:18:22.430
shorter nanosecond me nanosecond layton
nanosecond pulses which is for us is

00:18:22.430 --> 00:18:22.440
nanosecond pulses which is for us is
 

00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:26.450
nanosecond pulses which is for us is
infinity you know it's very long but you

00:18:26.450 --> 00:18:26.460
infinity you know it's very long but you
 

00:18:26.460 --> 00:18:27.470
infinity you know it's very long but you
do better be

00:18:27.470 --> 00:18:27.480
do better be
 

00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:29.480
do better be
because of course the heat doesn't have

00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:29.490
because of course the heat doesn't have
 

00:18:29.490 --> 00:18:32.060
because of course the heat doesn't have
the time to pop again between between

00:18:32.060 --> 00:18:32.070
the time to pop again between between
 

00:18:32.070 --> 00:18:39.250
the time to pop again between between
before the block is it's it's molten and

00:18:39.250 --> 00:18:39.260
before the block is it's it's molten and
 

00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:42.650
before the block is it's it's molten and
and then you have the femtosecond laser

00:18:42.650 --> 00:18:42.660
and then you have the femtosecond laser
 

00:18:42.660 --> 00:18:45.050
and then you have the femtosecond laser
where you come with a very very short

00:18:45.050 --> 00:18:45.060
where you come with a very very short
 

00:18:45.060 --> 00:18:48.560
where you come with a very very short
pulse and you deposit the energy and the

00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:48.570
pulse and you deposit the energy and the
 

00:18:48.570 --> 00:18:53.390
pulse and you deposit the energy and the
the temperature I mean the hate doesn't

00:18:53.390 --> 00:18:53.400
the temperature I mean the hate doesn't
 

00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:55.730
the temperature I mean the hate doesn't
have the time to propagate and you make

00:18:55.730 --> 00:18:55.740
have the time to propagate and you make
 

00:18:55.740 --> 00:19:00.050
have the time to propagate and you make
this very nice holes and it's a very

00:19:00.050 --> 00:19:00.060
this very nice holes and it's a very
 

00:19:00.060 --> 00:19:04.760
this very nice holes and it's a very
very precise way to really oblate

00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:04.770
very precise way to really oblate
 

00:19:04.770 --> 00:19:11.420
very precise way to really oblate
materials and this gives you some idea

00:19:11.420 --> 00:19:11.430
materials and this gives you some idea
 

00:19:11.430 --> 00:19:14.150
materials and this gives you some idea
you know of what we could do what you

00:19:14.150 --> 00:19:14.160
you know of what we could do what you
 

00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:15.980
you know of what we could do what you
can do in fact really easily now is

00:19:15.980 --> 00:19:15.990
can do in fact really easily now is
 

00:19:15.990 --> 00:19:20.810
can do in fact really easily now is
really what widely known was he highly

00:19:20.810 --> 00:19:20.820
really what widely known was he highly
 

00:19:20.820 --> 00:19:25.430
really what widely known was he highly
done everywhere and you can see that we

00:19:25.430 --> 00:19:25.440
done everywhere and you can see that we
 

00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:30.260
done everywhere and you can see that we
can really make holes and so on very

00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:30.270
can really make holes and so on very
 

00:19:30.270 --> 00:19:31.100
can really make holes and so on very
precisely

00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:31.110
precisely
 

00:19:31.110 --> 00:19:33.560
precisely
there is no collateral damage and Owens

00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:33.570
there is no collateral damage and Owens
 

00:19:33.570 --> 00:19:36.620
there is no collateral damage and Owens
very clean and very small okay

00:19:36.620 --> 00:19:36.630
very clean and very small okay
 

00:19:36.630 --> 00:19:38.480
very clean and very small okay
you see what we have feature of size

00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:38.490
you see what we have feature of size
 

00:19:38.490 --> 00:19:41.000
you see what we have feature of size
which is less than a micrometers you

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:41.010
which is less than a micrometers you
 

00:19:41.010 --> 00:19:44.840
which is less than a micrometers you
know in in size and no damages so of

00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:44.850
know in in size and no damages so of
 

00:19:44.850 --> 00:19:49.160
know in in size and no damages so of
course now one beautiful way to use this

00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:49.170
course now one beautiful way to use this
 

00:19:49.170 --> 00:19:55.790
course now one beautiful way to use this
with this this laser is to is to do ice

00:19:55.790 --> 00:19:55.800
with this this laser is to is to do ice
 

00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:58.220
with this this laser is to is to do ice
surgery because after all eyes you know

00:19:58.220 --> 00:19:58.230
surgery because after all eyes you know
 

00:19:58.230 --> 00:20:02.750
surgery because after all eyes you know
is some magical tissue and also is not

00:20:02.750 --> 00:20:02.760
is some magical tissue and also is not
 

00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:05.150
is some magical tissue and also is not
the kind of things where you have to be

00:20:05.150 --> 00:20:05.160
the kind of things where you have to be
 

00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:09.530
the kind of things where you have to be
accurate with ice and so we thought

00:20:09.530 --> 00:20:09.540
accurate with ice and so we thought
 

00:20:09.540 --> 00:20:13.340
accurate with ice and so we thought
about that in fact we thought because we

00:20:13.340 --> 00:20:13.350
about that in fact we thought because we
 

00:20:13.350 --> 00:20:17.270
about that in fact we thought because we
had with little mishap happening in my

00:20:17.270 --> 00:20:17.280
had with little mishap happening in my
 

00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:20.690
had with little mishap happening in my
lab and this is one of one of my

00:20:20.690 --> 00:20:20.700
lab and this is one of one of my
 

00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:25.330
lab and this is one of one of my
students within the audience you know

00:20:25.330 --> 00:20:25.340
students within the audience you know
 

00:20:25.340 --> 00:20:29.030
students within the audience you know
God arranged the laser cutter laser in

00:20:29.030 --> 00:20:29.040
God arranged the laser cutter laser in
 

00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:32.810
God arranged the laser cutter laser in
his eyes and and immediately you know

00:20:32.810 --> 00:20:32.820
his eyes and and immediately you know
 

00:20:32.820 --> 00:20:35.120
his eyes and and immediately you know
for free to the students you know to the

00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:35.130
for free to the students you know to the
 

00:20:35.130 --> 00:20:39.080
for free to the students you know to the
hospital and they made the met after

00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:39.090
hospital and they made the met after
 

00:20:39.090 --> 00:20:41.500
hospital and they made the met after
largest who is also

00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:41.510
largest who is also
 

00:20:41.510 --> 00:20:47.740
largest who is also
here on Kurt and and so honkers look at

00:20:47.740 --> 00:20:47.750
here on Kurt and and so honkers look at
 

00:20:47.750 --> 00:20:54.130
here on Kurt and and so honkers look at
the detail do eyes both are here and say

00:20:54.130 --> 00:20:54.140
the detail do eyes both are here and say
 

00:20:54.140 --> 00:20:58.030
the detail do eyes both are here and say
wow this is very strange and yes you got

00:20:58.030 --> 00:20:58.040
wow this is very strange and yes you got
 

00:20:58.040 --> 00:21:04.060
wow this is very strange and yes you got
hit by the laser but it's strange and so

00:21:04.060 --> 00:21:04.070
hit by the laser but it's strange and so
 

00:21:04.070 --> 00:21:05.710
hit by the laser but it's strange and so
did you say what what is strange

00:21:05.710 --> 00:21:05.720
did you say what what is strange
 

00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:08.860
did you say what what is strange
well it's strange because the damage on

00:21:08.860 --> 00:21:08.870
well it's strange because the damage on
 

00:21:08.870 --> 00:21:13.420
well it's strange because the damage on
your retina is perfect so that

00:21:13.420 --> 00:21:13.430
your retina is perfect so that
 

00:21:13.430 --> 00:21:16.240
your retina is perfect so that
immediately you know of course you know

00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:16.250
immediately you know of course you know
 

00:21:16.250 --> 00:21:18.190
immediately you know of course you know
we had the University of Michigan you

00:21:18.190 --> 00:21:18.200
we had the University of Michigan you
 

00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:21.310
we had the University of Michigan you
know excited about it they put some

00:21:21.310 --> 00:21:21.320
know excited about it they put some
 

00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:24.130
know excited about it they put some
money in it and and and then we add but

00:21:24.130 --> 00:21:24.140
money in it and and and then we add but
 

00:21:24.140 --> 00:21:26.440
money in it and and and then we add but
started the field of femtosecond laser

00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:26.450
started the field of femtosecond laser
 

00:21:26.450 --> 00:21:30.610
started the field of femtosecond laser
which is a very very important field ok

00:21:30.610 --> 00:21:30.620
which is a very very important field ok
 

00:21:30.620 --> 00:21:34.330
which is a very very important field ok
so this is just to give you an idea what

00:21:34.330 --> 00:21:34.340
so this is just to give you an idea what
 

00:21:34.340 --> 00:21:38.880
so this is just to give you an idea what
we can do you know on on the on the

00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:38.890
we can do you know on on the on the
 

00:21:38.890 --> 00:21:42.250
we can do you know on on the on the
cornea we can use it all kinds of things

00:21:42.250 --> 00:21:42.260
cornea we can use it all kinds of things
 

00:21:42.260 --> 00:21:47.860
cornea we can use it all kinds of things
no we can on enough technology and so it

00:21:47.860 --> 00:21:47.870
no we can on enough technology and so it
 

00:21:47.870 --> 00:21:49.210
no we can on enough technology and so it
was very exciting

00:21:49.210 --> 00:21:49.220
was very exciting
 

00:21:49.220 --> 00:21:52.930
was very exciting
in fact so if you are I'm just show here

00:21:52.930 --> 00:21:52.940
in fact so if you are I'm just show here
 

00:21:52.940 --> 00:21:58.440
in fact so if you are I'm just show here
if you have 50 picosecond laser which is

00:21:58.440 --> 00:21:58.450
if you have 50 picosecond laser which is
 

00:21:58.450 --> 00:22:03.760
if you have 50 picosecond laser which is
long for us ok and if you have 300 10

00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:03.770
long for us ok and if you have 300 10
 

00:22:03.770 --> 00:22:05.680
long for us ok and if you have 300 10
toes are gone you can you see we can

00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:05.690
toes are gone you can you see we can
 

00:22:05.690 --> 00:22:09.400
toes are gone you can you see we can
really create this flap you know very

00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:09.410
really create this flap you know very
 

00:22:09.410 --> 00:22:12.610
really create this flap you know very
very nicely you know and and this is

00:22:12.610 --> 00:22:12.620
very nicely you know and and this is
 

00:22:12.620 --> 00:22:17.460
very nicely you know and and this is
being done you know now as I saw also a

00:22:17.460 --> 00:22:17.470
being done you know now as I saw also a
 

00:22:17.470 --> 00:22:20.620
being done you know now as I saw also a
few few of the largest here in the

00:22:20.620 --> 00:22:20.630
few few of the largest here in the
 

00:22:20.630 --> 00:22:24.940
few few of the largest here in the
audience and it's great so now I I had I

00:22:24.940 --> 00:22:24.950
audience and it's great so now I I had I
 

00:22:24.950 --> 00:22:29.740
audience and it's great so now I I had I
had a movie showing this creation of a

00:22:29.740 --> 00:22:29.750
had a movie showing this creation of a
 

00:22:29.750 --> 00:22:33.790
had a movie showing this creation of a
flap but I have to say that and some cup

00:22:33.790 --> 00:22:33.800
flap but I have to say that and some cup
 

00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:36.040
flap but I have to say that and some cup
after some comments people say well if

00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:36.050
after some comments people say well if
 

00:22:36.050 --> 00:22:39.880
after some comments people say well if
you show this this this movie maybe some

00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:39.890
you show this this this movie maybe some
 

00:22:39.890 --> 00:22:41.830
you show this this this movie maybe some
people are not going to stand it you

00:22:41.830 --> 00:22:41.840
people are not going to stand it you
 

00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:44.230
people are not going to stand it you
know for it because it's so I'm I'm not

00:22:44.230 --> 00:22:44.240
know for it because it's so I'm I'm not
 

00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:47.260
know for it because it's so I'm I'm not
going to show it okay and I will save

00:22:47.260 --> 00:22:47.270
going to show it okay and I will save
 

00:22:47.270 --> 00:22:49.590
going to show it okay and I will save
some time

00:22:49.590 --> 00:22:49.600
some time
 

00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:52.570
some time
but anyway if you want really to talk

00:22:52.570 --> 00:22:52.580
but anyway if you want really to talk
 

00:22:52.580 --> 00:22:55.120
but anyway if you want really to talk
about that here you have specialist

00:22:55.120 --> 00:22:55.130
about that here you have specialist
 

00:22:55.130 --> 00:22:57.940
about that here you have specialist
at least we at least we a specialist you

00:22:57.940 --> 00:22:57.950
at least we at least we a specialist you
 

00:22:57.950 --> 00:23:02.650
at least we at least we a specialist you
know on this thing here okay now let's

00:23:02.650 --> 00:23:02.660
know on this thing here okay now let's
 

00:23:02.660 --> 00:23:09.000
know on this thing here okay now let's
go back to my to my my hot nap here and

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:09.010
go back to my to my my hot nap here and
 

00:23:09.010 --> 00:23:12.730
go back to my to my my hot nap here and
so as I said you so we were here for a

00:23:12.730 --> 00:23:12.740
so as I said you so we were here for a
 

00:23:12.740 --> 00:23:14.980
so as I said you so we were here for a
short while and now we are climbing up

00:23:14.980 --> 00:23:14.990
short while and now we are climbing up
 

00:23:14.990 --> 00:23:18.070
short while and now we are climbing up
as I said we are in this area right now

00:23:18.070 --> 00:23:18.080
as I said we are in this area right now
 

00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:20.529
as I said we are in this area right now
and what's exciting here

00:23:20.529 --> 00:23:20.539
and what's exciting here
 

00:23:20.539 --> 00:23:25.779
and what's exciting here
you know one we are which was like this

00:23:25.779 --> 00:23:25.789
you know one we are which was like this
 

00:23:25.789 --> 00:23:29.169
you know one we are which was like this
right yeah when we when you are in this

00:23:29.169 --> 00:23:29.179
right yeah when we when you are in this
 

00:23:29.179 --> 00:23:36.100
right yeah when we when you are in this
area of of you know 10 to the 20 and 25

00:23:36.100 --> 00:23:36.110
area of of you know 10 to the 20 and 25
 

00:23:36.110 --> 00:23:38.850
area of of you know 10 to the 20 and 25
weeks ago when you are shining the laser

00:23:38.850 --> 00:23:38.860
weeks ago when you are shining the laser
 

00:23:38.860 --> 00:23:42.190
weeks ago when you are shining the laser
over a very small size I mean sports

00:23:42.190 --> 00:23:42.200
over a very small size I mean sports
 

00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:45.220
over a very small size I mean sports
sports eyes like donna said wavelength

00:23:45.220 --> 00:23:45.230
sports eyes like donna said wavelength
 

00:23:45.230 --> 00:23:47.860
sports eyes like donna said wavelength
of light then you are producing with

00:23:47.860 --> 00:23:47.870
of light then you are producing with
 

00:23:47.870 --> 00:23:48.880
of light then you are producing with
amongest

00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:48.890
amongest
 

00:23:48.890 --> 00:23:51.930
amongest
intensities and you are producing

00:23:51.930 --> 00:23:51.940
intensities and you are producing
 

00:23:51.940 --> 00:23:56.440
intensities and you are producing
particles you know of any kind of

00:23:56.440 --> 00:23:56.450
particles you know of any kind of
 

00:23:56.450 --> 00:23:59.500
particles you know of any kind of
particles any kind of radiations with

00:23:59.500 --> 00:23:59.510
particles any kind of radiations with
 

00:23:59.510 --> 00:24:03.909
particles any kind of radiations with
very large with energy okay very freely

00:24:03.909 --> 00:24:03.919
very large with energy okay very freely
 

00:24:03.919 --> 00:24:04.779
very large with energy okay very freely
okay

00:24:04.779 --> 00:24:04.789
okay
 

00:24:04.789 --> 00:24:09.760
okay
it's amazing and so this is a we call a

00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:09.770
it's amazing and so this is a we call a
 

00:24:09.770 --> 00:24:14.740
it's amazing and so this is a we call a
universal source of eye energy particle

00:24:14.740 --> 00:24:14.750
universal source of eye energy particle
 

00:24:14.750 --> 00:24:19.270
universal source of eye energy particle
and radiations and this and this type of

00:24:19.270 --> 00:24:19.280
and radiations and this and this type of
 

00:24:19.280 --> 00:24:22.930
and radiations and this and this type of
course of work is being done at Lund you

00:24:22.930 --> 00:24:22.940
course of work is being done at Lund you
 

00:24:22.940 --> 00:24:27.730
course of work is being done at Lund you
know not there if one in Sweden

00:24:27.730 --> 00:24:27.740
know not there if one in Sweden
 

00:24:27.740 --> 00:24:32.980
know not there if one in Sweden
anyway and and if you are interested

00:24:32.980 --> 00:24:32.990
anyway and and if you are interested
 

00:24:32.990 --> 00:24:37.330
anyway and and if you are interested
people here okay so now what we are what

00:24:37.330 --> 00:24:37.340
people here okay so now what we are what
 

00:24:37.340 --> 00:24:41.279
people here okay so now what we are what
we want to do now is we are producing we

00:24:41.279 --> 00:24:41.289
we want to do now is we are producing we
 

00:24:41.289 --> 00:24:45.010
we want to do now is we are producing we
this was an idea from

00:24:45.010 --> 00:24:45.020
this was an idea from
 

00:24:45.020 --> 00:24:48.310
this was an idea from
Tajima and Dowson tashirojima a very

00:24:48.310 --> 00:24:48.320
Tajima and Dowson tashirojima a very
 

00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:51.190
Tajima and Dowson tashirojima a very
good friend of mine of a lot of people

00:24:51.190 --> 00:24:51.200
good friend of mine of a lot of people
 

00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:56.529
good friend of mine of a lot of people
also and the idea is this ID in 1979 he

00:24:56.529 --> 00:24:56.539
also and the idea is this ID in 1979 he
 

00:24:56.539 --> 00:24:59.110
also and the idea is this ID in 1979 he
said well you know looking at ducks or

00:24:59.110 --> 00:24:59.120
said well you know looking at ducks or
 

00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:04.750
said well you know looking at ducks or
whatever on the lake you know looking at

00:25:04.750 --> 00:25:04.760
whatever on the lake you know looking at
 

00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:08.810
whatever on the lake you know looking at
surf surfer and so on he said well maybe

00:25:08.810 --> 00:25:08.820
surf surfer and so on he said well maybe
 

00:25:08.820 --> 00:25:11.899
surf surfer and so on he said well maybe
we should use the same effect that is

00:25:11.899 --> 00:25:11.909
we should use the same effect that is
 

00:25:11.909 --> 00:25:15.529
we should use the same effect that is
being used by surfer in order really to

00:25:15.529 --> 00:25:15.539
being used by surfer in order really to
 

00:25:15.539 --> 00:25:20.629
being used by surfer in order really to
get particles moving so they they they

00:25:20.629 --> 00:25:20.639
get particles moving so they they they
 

00:25:20.639 --> 00:25:25.100
get particles moving so they they they
really wrote this very nice paper but of

00:25:25.100 --> 00:25:25.110
really wrote this very nice paper but of
 

00:25:25.110 --> 00:25:27.789
really wrote this very nice paper but of
course is 1979

00:25:27.789 --> 00:25:27.799
course is 1979
 

00:25:27.799 --> 00:25:34.730
course is 1979
so it's before 1985 so I didn't know

00:25:34.730 --> 00:25:34.740
so it's before 1985 so I didn't know
 

00:25:34.740 --> 00:25:37.340
so it's before 1985 so I didn't know
about this effect you know and Toshi

00:25:37.340 --> 00:25:37.350
about this effect you know and Toshi
 

00:25:37.350 --> 00:25:40.970
about this effect you know and Toshi
didn't know about the CPA okay so but

00:25:40.970 --> 00:25:40.980
didn't know about the CPA okay so but
 

00:25:40.980 --> 00:25:44.029
didn't know about the CPA okay so but
fortunately we had scientists at an

00:25:44.029 --> 00:25:44.039
fortunately we had scientists at an
 

00:25:44.039 --> 00:25:47.210
fortunately we had scientists at an
array of Naval Research Lab who we

00:25:47.210 --> 00:25:47.220
array of Naval Research Lab who we
 

00:25:47.220 --> 00:25:50.480
array of Naval Research Lab who we
really were able ready to solve the

00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:50.490
really were able ready to solve the
 

00:25:50.490 --> 00:25:53.690
really were able ready to solve the
potential to put the two concepts CPA

00:25:53.690 --> 00:25:53.700
potential to put the two concepts CPA
 

00:25:53.700 --> 00:25:56.240
potential to put the two concepts CPA
and laser Wakefield accelerations you

00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:56.250
and laser Wakefield accelerations you
 

00:25:56.250 --> 00:25:57.980
and laser Wakefield accelerations you
know together in order to accelerate

00:25:57.980 --> 00:25:57.990
know together in order to accelerate
 

00:25:57.990 --> 00:26:00.980
know together in order to accelerate
particles and this is what is going on

00:26:00.980 --> 00:26:00.990
particles and this is what is going on
 

00:26:00.990 --> 00:26:04.369
particles and this is what is going on
now in the many many laboratories in the

00:26:04.369 --> 00:26:04.379
now in the many many laboratories in the
 

00:26:04.379 --> 00:26:09.799
now in the many many laboratories in the
world you have lasers here and you shine

00:26:09.799 --> 00:26:09.809
world you have lasers here and you shine
 

00:26:09.809 --> 00:26:14.450
world you have lasers here and you shine
the laser on this gas jet and and you're

00:26:14.450 --> 00:26:14.460
the laser on this gas jet and and you're
 

00:26:14.460 --> 00:26:16.730
the laser on this gas jet and and you're
polishing a plasma you know which is a

00:26:16.730 --> 00:26:16.740
polishing a plasma you know which is a
 

00:26:16.740 --> 00:26:20.330
polishing a plasma you know which is a
plasma is a kind of a soup of electrons

00:26:20.330 --> 00:26:20.340
plasma is a kind of a soup of electrons
 

00:26:20.340 --> 00:26:23.720
plasma is a kind of a soup of electrons
and and and protons and so on

00:26:23.720 --> 00:26:23.730
and and and protons and so on
 

00:26:23.730 --> 00:26:26.899
and and and protons and so on
and you are creating this wave this

00:26:26.899 --> 00:26:26.909
and you are creating this wave this
 

00:26:26.909 --> 00:26:31.369
and you are creating this wave this
plasma waves where the electrons are

00:26:31.369 --> 00:26:31.379
plasma waves where the electrons are
 

00:26:31.379 --> 00:26:35.659
plasma waves where the electrons are
going to be trapped and dragged at the

00:26:35.659 --> 00:26:35.669
going to be trapped and dragged at the
 

00:26:35.669 --> 00:26:38.710
going to be trapped and dragged at the
speed of light you know by this wave

00:26:38.710 --> 00:26:38.720
speed of light you know by this wave
 

00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:42.619
speed of light you know by this wave
okay so this now it is really we were

00:26:42.619 --> 00:26:42.629
okay so this now it is really we were
 

00:26:42.629 --> 00:26:46.039
okay so this now it is really we were
talking last night with Olga this is

00:26:46.039 --> 00:26:46.049
talking last night with Olga this is
 

00:26:46.049 --> 00:26:49.070
talking last night with Olga this is
ready is the future for electron

00:26:49.070 --> 00:26:49.080
ready is the future for electron
 

00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:54.980
ready is the future for electron
accelerations and for is because we have

00:26:54.980 --> 00:26:54.990
accelerations and for is because we have
 

00:26:54.990 --> 00:26:57.259
accelerations and for is because we have
example problems in in high-energy

00:26:57.259 --> 00:26:57.269
example problems in in high-energy
 

00:26:57.269 --> 00:26:59.659
example problems in in high-energy
physics there are problems because you

00:26:59.659 --> 00:26:59.669
physics there are problems because you
 

00:26:59.669 --> 00:27:02.659
physics there are problems because you
have to build this huge accelerators

00:27:02.659 --> 00:27:02.669
have to build this huge accelerators
 

00:27:02.669 --> 00:27:05.509
have to build this huge accelerators
here you have the CERN accelerator or

00:27:05.509 --> 00:27:05.519
here you have the CERN accelerator or
 

00:27:05.519 --> 00:27:12.560
here you have the CERN accelerator or
LHC 27 kilometer in confluence yeah you

00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:12.570
LHC 27 kilometer in confluence yeah you
 

00:27:12.570 --> 00:27:15.619
LHC 27 kilometer in confluence yeah you
know and about 70 meters underground

00:27:15.619 --> 00:27:15.629
know and about 70 meters underground
 

00:27:15.629 --> 00:27:19.269
know and about 70 meters underground
so it is really of course it cost

00:27:19.269 --> 00:27:19.279
so it is really of course it cost
 

00:27:19.279 --> 00:27:21.860
so it is really of course it cost
enormous amount of in earth

00:27:21.860 --> 00:27:21.870
enormous amount of in earth
 

00:27:21.870 --> 00:27:26.149
enormous amount of in earth
of of money and now because for the the

00:27:26.149 --> 00:27:26.159
of of money and now because for the the
 

00:27:26.159 --> 00:27:28.850
of of money and now because for the the
next step the next next Collider is

00:27:28.850 --> 00:27:28.860
next step the next next Collider is
 

00:27:28.860 --> 00:27:31.460
next step the next next Collider is
going to be even bigger okay

00:27:31.460 --> 00:27:31.470
going to be even bigger okay
 

00:27:31.470 --> 00:27:36.799
going to be even bigger okay
and will cost in an affordable amount of

00:27:36.799 --> 00:27:36.809
and will cost in an affordable amount of
 

00:27:36.809 --> 00:27:40.039
and will cost in an affordable amount of
money so really it is very important

00:27:40.039 --> 00:27:40.049
money so really it is very important
 

00:27:40.049 --> 00:27:43.850
money so really it is very important
really to come to come and and with the

00:27:43.850 --> 00:27:43.860
really to come to come and and with the
 

00:27:43.860 --> 00:27:46.460
really to come to come and and with the
new technology and you think that if you

00:27:46.460 --> 00:27:46.470
new technology and you think that if you
 

00:27:46.470 --> 00:27:50.029
new technology and you think that if you
are ready we placing the technology use

00:27:50.029 --> 00:27:50.039
are ready we placing the technology use
 

00:27:50.039 --> 00:27:54.799

turn on a football field okay so this is

00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:38.250
turn on a football field okay so this is
 

00:28:38.250 --> 00:28:42.799
turn on a football field okay so this is
pretty good okay but you know of course

00:28:42.799 --> 00:28:42.809
pretty good okay but you know of course
 

00:28:42.809 --> 00:28:46.399
pretty good okay but you know of course
we like with toshi to look ahead all the

00:28:46.399 --> 00:28:46.409
we like with toshi to look ahead all the
 

00:28:46.409 --> 00:28:52.159
we like with toshi to look ahead all the
time and so some people you know in the

00:28:52.159 --> 00:28:52.169
time and so some people you know in the
 

00:28:52.169 --> 00:28:55.669

agency's a difficulty to see that you

00:28:55.669 --> 00:28:55.679
agency's a difficulty to see that you
 

00:28:55.679 --> 00:28:58.789
agency's a difficulty to see that you
know and and but anyway this way we are

00:28:58.789 --> 00:28:58.799
know and and but anyway this way we are
 

00:28:58.799 --> 00:29:03.409
know and and but anyway this way we are
okay and so we like to look ahead and so

00:29:03.409 --> 00:29:03.419
okay and so we like to look ahead and so
 

00:29:03.419 --> 00:29:07.880
okay and so we like to look ahead and so
right now let me tell you but we can

00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:07.890
right now let me tell you but we can
 

00:29:07.890 --> 00:29:12.980
right now let me tell you but we can
produce now something like devices GeV

00:29:12.980 --> 00:29:12.990
produce now something like devices GeV
 

00:29:12.990 --> 00:29:17.090
produce now something like devices GeV
devices a centimeter of size okay now we

00:29:17.090 --> 00:29:17.100
devices a centimeter of size okay now we
 

00:29:17.100 --> 00:29:22.789
devices a centimeter of size okay now we
can produce up to 5 GeV but 5 GV is is

00:29:22.789 --> 00:29:22.799
can produce up to 5 GeV but 5 GV is is
 

00:29:22.799 --> 00:29:26.139
can produce up to 5 GeV but 5 GV is is
something like 10 centimeter in lab okay

00:29:26.139 --> 00:29:26.149
something like 10 centimeter in lab okay
 

00:29:26.149 --> 00:29:31.100
something like 10 centimeter in lab okay
and yes we could very maybe put turn on

00:29:31.100 --> 00:29:31.110
and yes we could very maybe put turn on
 

00:29:31.110 --> 00:29:34.549
and yes we could very maybe put turn on
the football field but could we - but

00:29:34.549 --> 00:29:34.559
the football field but could we - but
 

00:29:34.559 --> 00:29:35.870
the football field but could we - but
much better than that

00:29:35.870 --> 00:29:35.880
much better than that
 

00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:43.669
much better than that
and right now the reason is yes yes we

00:29:43.669 --> 00:29:43.679
and right now the reason is yes yes we
 

00:29:43.679 --> 00:29:49.010
and right now the reason is yes yes we
cool in fact I'm not putting your leg

00:29:49.010 --> 00:29:49.020

the accelerator kind of TeV accelerator

00:29:59.870 --> 00:29:59.880
the accelerator kind of TeV accelerator
 

00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:03.289
the accelerator kind of TeV accelerator
on the fingertip and and by by doing

00:30:03.289 --> 00:30:03.299
on the fingertip and and by by doing
 

00:30:03.299 --> 00:30:04.789
on the fingertip and and by by doing
what okay

00:30:04.789 --> 00:30:04.799
what okay
 

00:30:04.799 --> 00:30:08.840
what okay
instead of using gas which has which has

00:30:08.840 --> 00:30:08.850
instead of using gas which has which has
 

00:30:08.850 --> 00:30:14.600
instead of using gas which has which has
a very low density of electrons then we

00:30:14.600 --> 00:30:14.610
a very low density of electrons then we
 

00:30:14.610 --> 00:30:17.680
a very low density of electrons then we
have to use black light to use solid

00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:17.690
have to use black light to use solid
 

00:30:17.690 --> 00:30:23.360
have to use black light to use solid
solid and so you have six order of

00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:23.370
solid and so you have six order of
 

00:30:23.370 --> 00:30:27.260
solid and so you have six order of
magnitude larger amount of electrons

00:30:27.260 --> 00:30:27.270
magnitude larger amount of electrons
 

00:30:27.270 --> 00:30:29.419
magnitude larger amount of electrons
okay because we are working also with

00:30:29.419 --> 00:30:29.429
okay because we are working also with
 

00:30:29.429 --> 00:30:34.669
okay because we are working also with
gas at low low density gas and and then

00:30:34.669 --> 00:30:34.679
gas at low low density gas and and then
 

00:30:34.679 --> 00:30:36.230
gas at low low density gas and and then
but you say wow

00:30:36.230 --> 00:30:36.240
but you say wow
 

00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:38.240
but you say wow
but I mean now light won't be able to

00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:38.250
but I mean now light won't be able to
 

00:30:38.250 --> 00:30:40.310
but I mean now light won't be able to
propagate through the solid at this very

00:30:40.310 --> 00:30:40.320
propagate through the solid at this very
 

00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:45.919
propagate through the solid at this very
high intensity and so so okay fine but

00:30:45.919 --> 00:30:45.929
high intensity and so so okay fine but
 

00:30:45.929 --> 00:30:49.520
high intensity and so so okay fine but
if we can if we can really develop high

00:30:49.520 --> 00:30:49.530
if we can if we can really develop high
 

00:30:49.530 --> 00:30:54.950
if we can if we can really develop high
I intensity x-ray now so but is instead

00:30:54.950 --> 00:30:54.960
I intensity x-ray now so but is instead
 

00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:57.620
I intensity x-ray now so but is instead
of visit working in a visible work in

00:30:57.620 --> 00:30:57.630
of visit working in a visible work in
 

00:30:57.630 --> 00:31:02.000
of visit working in a visible work in
the x-ray regime then with the x-rays

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:02.010
the x-ray regime then with the x-rays
 

00:31:02.010 --> 00:31:07.250
the x-ray regime then with the x-rays
high intensity can penetrate into into

00:31:07.250 --> 00:31:07.260
high intensity can penetrate into into
 

00:31:07.260 --> 00:31:10.820
high intensity can penetrate into into
the salad and to produce this Wakefield

00:31:10.820 --> 00:31:10.830

00:31:10.830 --> 00:31:13.669
the salad and to produce this Wakefield
this is exactly what we are doing right

00:31:13.669 --> 00:31:13.679
this is exactly what we are doing right
 

00:31:13.679 --> 00:31:17.930
this is exactly what we are doing right
now you know it might be at at the ecole

00:31:17.930 --> 00:31:17.940

well you know protons therapy per exam

00:33:15.650 --> 00:33:15.660
well you know protons therapy per exam
 

00:33:15.660 --> 00:33:20.480
well you know protons therapy per exam
for cancer and so on is really the the

00:33:20.480 --> 00:33:20.490
for cancer and so on is really the the
 

00:33:20.490 --> 00:33:23.810
for cancer and so on is really the the
the really the therapy of choice okay

00:33:23.810 --> 00:33:23.820
the really the therapy of choice okay
 

00:33:23.820 --> 00:33:26.840
the really the therapy of choice okay
because the protons not like other

00:33:26.840 --> 00:33:26.850
because the protons not like other
 

00:33:26.850 --> 00:33:30.350
because the protons not like other
radiation of particles they don't burn

00:33:30.350 --> 00:33:30.360
radiation of particles they don't burn
 

00:33:30.360 --> 00:33:35.170
radiation of particles they don't burn
the tissue between bit between really

00:33:35.170 --> 00:33:35.180
the tissue between bit between really
 

00:33:35.180 --> 00:33:40.220
the tissue between bit between really
the the skin and the tumors you can

00:33:40.220 --> 00:33:40.230
the the skin and the tumors you can
 

00:33:40.230 --> 00:33:45.410
the the skin and the tumors you can
really address tumors almost you know

00:33:45.410 --> 00:33:45.420
really address tumors almost you know
 

00:33:45.420 --> 00:33:48.820
really address tumors almost you know
uniquely so you can deposit your proton

00:33:48.820 --> 00:33:48.830
uniquely so you can deposit your proton
 

00:33:48.830 --> 00:33:54.500
uniquely so you can deposit your proton
exactly in a tumor now also what is nice

00:33:54.500 --> 00:33:54.510
exactly in a tumor now also what is nice
 

00:33:54.510 --> 00:33:58.100
exactly in a tumor now also what is nice
about having these high intensity lasers

00:33:58.100 --> 00:33:58.110
about having these high intensity lasers
 

00:33:58.110 --> 00:34:02.300
about having these high intensity lasers
is you can make particles and these

00:34:02.300 --> 00:34:02.310
is you can make particles and these
 

00:34:02.310 --> 00:34:03.410

and so on and you can use them you know
 

00:34:08.460 --> 00:34:16.720
and so on and you can use them you know
to implant these particles into into the

00:34:16.720 --> 00:34:16.730
to implant these particles into into the
 

00:34:16.730 --> 00:34:20.419
to implant these particles into into the
near the tumor or in the tumor of of the

00:34:20.419 --> 00:34:20.429
near the tumor or in the tumor of of the
 

00:34:20.429 --> 00:34:27.580
near the tumor or in the tumor of of the
patient also you can use these these

00:34:27.580 --> 00:34:27.590
patient also you can use these these
 

00:34:27.590 --> 00:34:33.080
patient also you can use these these
these I do isotopes and so on but you

00:34:33.080 --> 00:34:33.090
these I do isotopes and so on but you
 

00:34:33.090 --> 00:34:36.130
these I do isotopes and so on but you
know which in order to do all kind of

00:34:36.130 --> 00:34:36.140

00:35:05.120 --> 00:35:05.130
dreaming what I'd like to do him anyway
 

00:35:05.130 --> 00:35:08.360
dreaming what I'd like to do him anyway
so I did that all my life and made my

00:35:08.360 --> 00:35:08.370
so I did that all my life and made my
 

00:35:08.370 --> 00:35:13.700
so I did that all my life and made my
made my living with that and so anyway

00:35:13.700 --> 00:35:13.710
made my living with that and so anyway
 

00:35:13.710 --> 00:35:17.630
made my living with that and so anyway
so just one one really big problem we

00:35:17.630 --> 00:35:17.640
so just one one really big problem we
 

00:35:17.640 --> 00:35:20.840
so just one one really big problem we
have and this also together with Toshi

00:35:20.840 --> 00:35:20.850
have and this also together with Toshi
 

00:35:20.850 --> 00:35:25.880

while working on it and by the way we're

00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:25.890
while working on it and by the way we're
 

00:35:25.890 --> 00:35:28.850
while working on it and by the way we're
not working because it's easy what's

00:35:28.850 --> 00:35:28.860
not working because it's easy what's
 

00:35:28.860 --> 00:35:30.470
not working because it's easy what's
going to we're working on it because

00:35:30.470 --> 00:35:30.480
going to we're working on it because
 

00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:32.420
going to we're working on it because
it's difficult okay

00:35:32.420 --> 00:35:32.430
it's difficult okay
 

00:35:32.430 --> 00:35:35.360
it's difficult okay
and what we want her to do is to

00:35:35.360 --> 00:35:35.370
and what we want her to do is to
 

00:35:35.370 --> 00:35:39.860
and what we want her to do is to
transmute transmute nuclear waste

00:35:39.860 --> 00:35:39.870
transmute transmute nuclear waste
 

00:35:39.870 --> 00:35:42.920
transmute transmute nuclear waste
because we have all nuclear energy it

00:35:42.920 --> 00:35:42.930
because we have all nuclear energy it
 

00:35:42.930 --> 00:35:46.310
because we have all nuclear energy it
may be the best candidate for the future

may be the best candidate for the future
 

00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:49.550
may be the best candidate for the future
but you are still you are still you know

00:35:49.550 --> 00:35:49.560
but you are still you are still you know

invented the terms now toilet science

00:36:00.380 --> 00:36:00.390
invented the terms now toilet science
 

00:36:00.390 --> 00:36:02.780
invented the terms now toilet science
it's time to do toilets and it's time to

00:36:02.780 --> 00:36:02.790
it's time to do toilets and it's time to
 

00:36:02.790 --> 00:36:05.990
it's time to do toilets and it's time to
to clean up what we have produced you

00:36:05.990 --> 00:36:06.000
to clean up what we have produced you
 

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:08.960
to clean up what we have produced you
know producing energy and so on for our

00:36:08.960 --> 00:36:08.970
know producing energy and so on for our
 

00:36:08.970 --> 00:36:14.030
know producing energy and so on for our
living and so and so the idea now it was

00:36:14.030 --> 00:36:14.040
living and so and so the idea now it was
 

00:36:14.040 --> 00:36:16.100
living and so and so the idea now it was
is

00:36:16.100 --> 00:36:16.110
is
 

00:36:16.110 --> 00:36:22.430
is
is we have to find ways okay to mitigate

00:36:22.430 --> 00:36:22.440
is we have to find ways okay to mitigate
 

00:36:22.440 --> 00:36:25.310
is we have to find ways okay to mitigate
you know this nuclear waste in one way

00:36:25.310 --> 00:36:25.320
you know this nuclear waste in one way
 

00:36:25.320 --> 00:36:29.300
you know this nuclear waste in one way
will be maybe to transmute this this

00:36:29.300 --> 00:36:29.310
will be maybe to transmute this this
 

00:36:29.310 --> 00:36:34.850
will be maybe to transmute this this
this nuclear waste into a new new new

00:36:34.850 --> 00:36:34.860
this nuclear waste into a new new new
 

00:36:34.860 --> 00:36:39.530
this nuclear waste into a new new new
form of atoms which are not which

00:36:39.530 --> 00:36:39.540
form of atoms which are not which
 

00:36:39.540 --> 00:36:41.360
form of atoms which are not which
doesn't don't have this problem of

00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:41.370
doesn't don't have this problem of
 

00:36:41.370 --> 00:36:44.360
doesn't don't have this problem of
radioactivity and so what you have to do

00:36:44.360 --> 00:36:44.370
radioactivity and so what you have to do
 

00:36:44.370 --> 00:36:47.900
radioactivity and so what you have to do
is to change the making of the nucleus

00:36:47.900 --> 00:36:47.910
is to change the making of the nucleus
 

00:36:47.910 --> 00:36:52.130
is to change the making of the nucleus
okay of so far if you have a I if you

00:36:52.130 --> 00:36:52.140
okay of so far if you have a I if you
 

00:36:52.140 --> 00:36:56.570
okay of so far if you have a I if you
have a nucleus atoms a okay and you have

00:36:56.570 --> 00:36:56.580
have a nucleus atoms a okay and you have
 

00:36:56.580 --> 00:37:00.530
have a nucleus atoms a okay and you have
a isotope a and which is maybe lighter

00:37:00.530 --> 00:37:00.540
a isotope a and which is maybe lighter
 

00:37:00.540 --> 00:37:03.110
a isotope a and which is maybe lighter
active for a long time so that takes me

00:37:03.110 --> 00:37:03.120
active for a long time so that takes me
 

00:37:03.120 --> 00:37:05.380
active for a long time so that takes me
example of technician for instance and

00:37:05.380 --> 00:37:05.390
example of technician for instance and
 

00:37:05.390 --> 00:37:09.020
example of technician for instance and
which can be radioactive for 100,000 of

00:37:09.020 --> 00:37:09.030
which can be radioactive for 100,000 of
 

00:37:09.030 --> 00:37:12.020
which can be radioactive for 100,000 of
years then if you can if you can really

00:37:12.020 --> 00:37:12.030
years then if you can if you can really
 

00:37:12.030 --> 00:37:17.690
years then if you can if you can really
large a a neutrons because now we have

00:37:17.690 --> 00:37:17.700
large a a neutrons because now we have
 

00:37:17.700 --> 00:37:19.580
large a a neutrons because now we have
freedom we know we know that we can

00:37:19.580 --> 00:37:19.590
freedom we know we know that we can
 

00:37:19.590 --> 00:37:21.650
freedom we know we know that we can
produce any kind of particles you know

00:37:21.650 --> 00:37:21.660
produce any kind of particles you know
 

00:37:21.660 --> 00:37:24.800
produce any kind of particles you know
including neutrons we can produce

00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:24.810
including neutrons we can produce
 

00:37:24.810 --> 00:37:28.460
including neutrons we can produce
neutrons you know in in this in nucleus

00:37:28.460 --> 00:37:28.470
neutrons you know in in this in nucleus
 

00:37:28.470 --> 00:37:32.570
neutrons you know in in this in nucleus
when you are changing the isotope a into

00:37:32.570 --> 00:37:32.580
when you are changing the isotope a into
 

00:37:32.580 --> 00:37:35.720
when you are changing the isotope a into
an isotope B but this time it can have

00:37:35.720 --> 00:37:35.730
an isotope B but this time it can have
 

00:37:35.730 --> 00:37:42.380
an isotope B but this time it can have
ready now radioactivity time wheel is of

00:37:42.380 --> 00:37:42.390
ready now radioactivity time wheel is of
 

00:37:42.390 --> 00:37:44.930
ready now radioactivity time wheel is of
the order of seconds of course this is

00:37:44.930 --> 00:37:44.940
the order of seconds of course this is
 

00:37:44.940 --> 00:37:48.500
the order of seconds of course this is
most favorable case but so we will I try

00:37:48.500 --> 00:37:48.510
most favorable case but so we will I try
 

00:37:48.510 --> 00:37:53.630
most favorable case but so we will I try
to extend the concept you know to to of

00:37:53.630 --> 00:37:53.640
to extend the concept you know to to of
 

00:37:53.640 --> 00:37:53.960
to extend the concept you know to to of
course

00:37:53.960 --> 00:37:53.970
course
 

00:37:53.970 --> 00:37:56.120
course
so nuclear waste which are really

00:37:56.120 --> 00:37:56.130
so nuclear waste which are really
 

00:37:56.130 --> 00:37:59.180
so nuclear waste which are really
polluting our life right now

00:37:59.180 --> 00:37:59.190
polluting our life right now
 

00:37:59.190 --> 00:38:01.940
polluting our life right now
so and so by the way sometime you have

00:38:01.940 --> 00:38:01.950
so and so by the way sometime you have
 

00:38:01.950 --> 00:38:05.510
so and so by the way sometime you have
you're lucky and this isotope B becomes

00:38:05.510 --> 00:38:05.520
you're lucky and this isotope B becomes
 

00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:09.680
you're lucky and this isotope B becomes
isotope C and it's it's stable so it

00:38:09.680 --> 00:38:09.690
isotope C and it's it's stable so it
 

00:38:09.690 --> 00:38:13.330
isotope C and it's it's stable so it
doesn't emit anything

00:38:13.330 --> 00:38:13.340
 

00:38:13.340 --> 00:38:19.910
so in conclusion for me is extreme light

00:38:19.910 --> 00:38:19.920
so in conclusion for me is extreme light
 

00:38:19.920 --> 00:38:23.270
so in conclusion for me is extreme light
is capable of generating the largest

00:38:23.270 --> 00:38:23.280
is capable of generating the largest
 

00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:27.070
is capable of generating the largest
field the largest accelerations so

00:38:27.070 --> 00:38:27.080
field the largest accelerations so
 

00:38:27.080 --> 00:38:29.829
field the largest accelerations so
largest temperature and the larger

00:38:29.829 --> 00:38:29.839
largest temperature and the larger
 

00:38:29.839 --> 00:38:33.969
largest temperature and the larger
pressure just with flight is amazing

00:38:33.969 --> 00:38:33.979
pressure just with flight is amazing
 

00:38:33.979 --> 00:38:36.819
pressure just with flight is amazing
and it carries the best hope and

00:38:36.819 --> 00:38:36.829
and it carries the best hope and
 

00:38:36.829 --> 00:38:38.829
and it carries the best hope and
opportunity for the future of science
