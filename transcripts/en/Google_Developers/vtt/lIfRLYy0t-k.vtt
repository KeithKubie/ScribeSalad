KORY JEFFREY: Greetings,
everyone, and welcome.

00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:05.100
We are on site at Founder
World in San Francisco.

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.100
Joining me in the studio is Lisa
Fetterman, the CEO of Nomiku,

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:11.920
who has a hardware and
software solution that

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:15.890
is changing the world
for the food industry.

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:17.140
Tell us a little bit about it.

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:19.306
LISA FETTERMAN: So Nomiku's
the first ever home sous

00:00:19.306 --> 00:00:20.850
vide immersion circulator.

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.680
And we have a Wi-Fi one
coming out this November

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:28.620
that you can use your app on
your phone for Android or iOS

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:31.360
or Windows Phone, where
it controls your machine.

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:32.610
And you can cook with one tap.

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:33.360
KORY JEFFREY: Wow.

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.290
So for those who don't know, can
you explain what sous vide is?

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:37.210
LISA FETTERMAN: Yes.

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:39.740
Sous vide is a relatively
new thing that's come about,

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:42.120
but it's been used for
decades by top chefs

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.510
all around the world.

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:48.260
And now top chefs use my
machine-- [INAUDIBLE].

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.790
And what it does is that it
controls water and circulates

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:52.950
it to a very
precise temperature.

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:55.410
What you do is put your
food inside of a bag

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.020
and then drop it in
the water, walk away.

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.394
When you come back, you
have a world class meal.

00:01:00.394 --> 00:01:01.150
KORY JEFFREY: Wow.

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:03.750
So what's the price point for
something like that, typically?

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.099
LISA FETTERMAN: $199.

00:01:05.099 --> 00:01:06.610
It used to be
thousands of dollars.

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:10.270
I remember working for
Jean-Georges and Mario Batali.

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:12.642
And we would have this
huge, hulking piece

00:01:12.642 --> 00:01:15.255
of laboratory equipment that
was thousands of dollars.

00:01:15.255 --> 00:01:18.105
And we would cook a lot
of our components in it.

00:01:18.105 --> 00:01:19.067
And I was like, why?

00:01:19.067 --> 00:01:20.525
When you took food
out of there, it

00:01:20.525 --> 00:01:23.288
was like eating heavenly food.

00:01:23.288 --> 00:01:25.239
You know how food
is perfect on TV?

00:01:25.239 --> 00:01:26.030
KORY JEFFREY: Yeah.

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:27.320
LISA FETTERMAN:
It's how they do it.

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:28.195
KORY JEFFREY: Really?

00:01:28.195 --> 00:01:30.990
So how long does it take to cook
something using that method?

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.840
LISA FETTERMAN: It really ranges
depending on what you cook.

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:34.790
Fish is 20 minutes.

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:36.880
Steak is an hour.

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.400
Sometimes short
ribs are 48 hours.

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.054
So you put that in there and
then you just go to sleep.

00:01:42.054 --> 00:01:43.470
KORY JEFFREY: And
then you wake up

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:44.160
and then you go to sleep again.

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:45.114
LISA FETTERMAN: Yeah.

00:01:45.114 --> 00:01:47.780
KORY JEFFREY: So you've recently
had a whole bunch of accolades,

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:49.390
including the White House,
we were talking about.

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:50.265
LISA FETTERMAN: Yeah.

00:01:50.265 --> 00:01:51.754
I'm a White House honored maker.

00:01:51.754 --> 00:01:53.920
That's how we got our start
in the Maker Revolution.

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.730
We traveled, actually, across
the United States teaching

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:58.750
people how to make
their own DIY,

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:00.710
open source sous vide machines.

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:02.890
Our code is still up on Eagle.

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:04.650
We have our CAD files up.

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:05.570
Whatever people want.

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:08.380
They can make their
own sous vide machine.

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:10.030
That's our start.

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:12.830
And this year, I'm
also Forbes 30 Under 30

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:15.500
and Zagat 30 under 30
for the innovation.

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.475
So thank you the media gods.

00:02:18.475 --> 00:02:20.105
KORY JEFFREY: It's
a lot of momentum.

00:02:20.105 --> 00:02:21.771
LISA FETTERMAN: Yeah,
a lot of momentum.

00:02:21.771 --> 00:02:26.399
This is a way of cooking that
everybody's been waiting for,

00:02:26.399 --> 00:02:27.065
myself included.

00:02:27.065 --> 00:02:29.300
And I couldn't believe it
hadn't been done before.

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:30.640
It's like modern art.

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.840
It's like, oh, you just control
the temperature very precisely?

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.309
My kid could do that.

00:02:35.309 --> 00:02:36.350
You know what I'm saying?

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:39.410
It was just too obvious, because
ever since the dawn of fire,

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:40.870
we've been trying to control it.

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.260
And if you think of our
chefs, what they do,

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.650
they're not the controllers
of the ingredients.

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:46.830
That's the farmers.

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.619
What they do in the
kitchen is control heat.

00:02:49.619 --> 00:02:51.785
And now you can control
heat to 0.1 degrees Celsius.

00:02:51.785 --> 00:02:54.938
That's completely revolutionary
to how you can cook.

00:02:54.938 --> 00:02:55.894
KORY JEFFREY: Great.

00:02:55.894 --> 00:02:58.445
And so what's the
market share like?

00:02:58.445 --> 00:02:59.820
LISA FETTERMAN:
The market share?

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:04.600
Well, great thing you asked,
because Unilver, Nestle,

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:08.840
and Campbell, they all lose
like $16 billion a year

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:13.923
in market share to people
like me, who cook food the way

00:03:13.923 --> 00:03:16.980
that people really, really
want to eat it, like perfectly.

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.180
So a big thing that
they lose out on

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:22.470
is frozen food, and
that's packaged food.

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:27.110
And what we do is that we have
packaged food that we sell.

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:29.000
We have it in beta
right now with Bi-Rite.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.940
All you have to do
is go to our website,

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:33.040
and then we ship it
right to your door.

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.195
You drop it in the water
and then walk away.

00:03:35.195 --> 00:03:38.130
It's just like microwaved food,
except it becomes the freaking

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.193
centerpiece of your meal.

00:03:40.193 --> 00:03:42.610
KORY JEFFREY: And it doesn't
lose any nutritional value?

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:44.230
LISA FETTERMAN: That's right.

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:47.320
Nothing cooks at above
100 degrees Celsius.

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:51.530
At 57 degrees Celsius,
the fat and the collagen

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:54.360
melt into the muscle of a steak.

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:58.590
Effectively, you can make NY
strip steak taste like Wagyu.

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:00.690
It's so good.

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:01.310
Magic happens.

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:02.265
KORY JEFFREY: You're
making me hungry.

00:04:02.265 --> 00:04:03.264
LISA FETTERMAN: Oh good.

00:04:03.264 --> 00:04:04.200
OK, you can come eat.

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.977
Come eat at Nomiku.

00:04:06.977 --> 00:04:09.060
KORY JEFFREY: So you're
also a speaker here today.

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:10.040
You have a booth.

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:11.566
How did the speaking session go?

00:04:11.566 --> 00:04:13.690
LISA FETTERMAN: Speaking
session was off the chain.

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:15.090
There's so many people here.

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:15.370
KORY JEFFREY: There are.

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:16.390
There's a lot.

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:17.377
LISA FETTERMAN: So
it was really fun

00:04:17.377 --> 00:04:18.880
to speak in front
of a big audience.

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:20.060
KORY JEFFREY: So what
was your message?

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:21.518
What were you trying
to talk about?

00:04:21.518 --> 00:04:23.900
LISA FETTERMAN: Message is
the connection between food

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:26.110
and everything in our lives.

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:31.790
People treat food
like, oh, whatever.

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:34.860
They treat it as some
kind of soft thing.

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:36.220
But it's hard.

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:38.530
It's real freaking money.

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:43.108
And also, you put it
in your body every day.

00:04:43.108 --> 00:04:45.170
KORY JEFFREY: Captive audience.

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:48.220
LISA FETTERMAN: The experience,
you have to have it.

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:49.640
What's another
experience that you

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:51.015
have with your
body where you put

00:04:51.015 --> 00:04:52.830
something inside of your body?

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:56.030
It's a very important thing.

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:58.508
It should be as sacred as that.

00:04:58.508 --> 00:04:59.591
KORY JEFFREY: I like that.

00:04:59.591 --> 00:05:00.091
That's good.

00:05:00.091 --> 00:05:01.052
That's really good.

00:05:01.052 --> 00:05:04.130
So what drew you to this event?

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:06.230
LISA FETTERMAN: This
event, I just love

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:10.560
that there's going to
be smart people here.

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:13.060
I don't have to explain
what sous vide is

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:14.810
to every single person.

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:18.830
And also, a lot of cool people,
like Tim Draper was here,

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:22.300
Danielle Fong, Eva
[INAUDIBLE], these people

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:24.860
that I watch from afar
build their stuff.

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:27.307
I'm like, ooh, how you do that?

00:05:27.307 --> 00:05:28.390
KORY JEFFREY: That's cool.

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:29.000
LISA FETTERMAN: That's
why it's exciting.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:29.770
KORY JEFFREY: And
so obviously, you're

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:32.016
a big fan of technology,
food technology.

00:05:32.016 --> 00:05:33.640
Is there anything
else in the landscape

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:36.250
that gets you excited from
a technology perspective?

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:38.900
LISA FETTERMAN: From a
technology perspective,

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:41.046
I love all things hardware.

00:05:41.046 --> 00:05:42.670
So there's this thing
called Everpurse.

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:44.888
They just partnered
with Kate Spade.

00:05:44.888 --> 00:05:49.168
And what they did is that they
made this cute, little bag.

00:05:49.168 --> 00:05:50.876
You drop your phone
in and it charges it.

00:05:50.876 --> 00:05:51.874
KORY JEFFREY:
That's pretty cool.

00:05:51.874 --> 00:05:53.040
LISA FETTERMAN: I need that.

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:54.041
I never charge my phone.

00:05:54.041 --> 00:05:54.873
KORY JEFFREY: Right.

00:05:54.873 --> 00:05:56.280
That's really clever, actually.

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:57.363
LISA FETTERMAN: I love it.

00:05:57.363 --> 00:05:58.860
KORY JEFFREY: Very cool.

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:01.400
And do you have a favorite
Google technology?

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:04.256
LISA FETTERMAN: A favorite Goog.

00:06:04.256 --> 00:06:05.950
Oh, Goog.

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:09.120
Well, I love Gmail, no doi.

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:11.040
[INAUDIBLE]

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:13.420
You know what I'm saying?

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:16.510
Gmail, I mean, I use it
for my business, too.

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:17.710
It's like lisa@nomiku.com.

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:21.600
That goes through Gmail.

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:24.850
I can't believe I've been
using it for years now.

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:26.375
I probably use a
lot of Google stuff

00:06:26.375 --> 00:06:28.200
and I don't even
know it's Google.

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:30.084
KORY JEFFREY: That
is probably true,

00:06:30.084 --> 00:06:31.500
which is part of
the point, right?

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:32.210
LISA FETTERMAN: Yes.

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:33.030
Actually, you know what?

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:34.535
One thing that I
really do notice

00:06:34.535 --> 00:06:37.690
that I insist on when
I'm in a ride share,

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:40.080
whether it's Lyft
or Uber, I'm like,

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:42.210
can you please use Google Maps?

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:46.030
For god's sake, use Google Maps.

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:48.162
KORY JEFFREY: I
do too, actually.

00:06:48.162 --> 00:06:49.870
Well, thank you very
much for joining me.

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:50.642
LISA FETTERMAN: Thank you.

00:06:50.642 --> 00:06:52.433
KORY JEFFREY: And thank
you for joining me.

00:06:52.433 --> 00:06:56.180
This has been on site at
Founder World San Francisco.

00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:58.930
