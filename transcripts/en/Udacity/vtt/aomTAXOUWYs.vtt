00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.600
Here are the correct answers negative 1. Great work if found that one. We start

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:10.078
solving this equation by multiplying both sides by the LCD this leaves us with 2

00:00:10.078 --> 00:00:15.320
times x minus 8 minus 6 times 2x minus 1 on the left hand side of the equation.

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:20.360
On the right hand side we'll still have 0 since 0 times any factor would still

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:24.993
be 0. Next we distribute and combine our like terms to get negative 10x. Minus

00:00:24.993 --> 00:00:30.341
10 equals zero. We rewrite this sign up here, and then solve for x. We add 10 to

00:00:30.341 --> 00:00:35.638
both sides, and then we divide both sides by negative 10. This gives us our

00:00:35.638 --> 00:00:39.750
final value of negative 1. For the excluded values, we want to look at these 2

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.649
denominators to figure out what x cannot equal. We know x cannot equivalent half

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:49.796
or this denominator here equals 0. Likewise we know x cannot equal positive 8 or

00:00:49.796 --> 00:00:53.892
this denominator would be 0 as well. Our final answer is not one of these

00:00:53.892 --> 00:00:59.145
excluded values. So here is our only solution, negative 1. Notice that there is

00:00:59.145 --> 00:01:03.700
another way to solve this equation. If we move this second fraction to the right

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:08.205
side of the equation we would have one fraction equal to another. We would just

00:01:08.205 --> 00:01:13.067
add this to both sides of our equation. Next we would multiply by the LCD or

00:01:13.067 --> 00:01:18.428
simply cross-multiply to get this next equation. After distributing and solving

00:01:18.428 --> 00:01:23.144
for x, we would find x would be equal to negative 1. If you use this method,

00:01:23.144 --> 00:01:23.953
that's great.
