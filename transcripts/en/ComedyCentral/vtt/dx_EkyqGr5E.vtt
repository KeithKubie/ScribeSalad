00:00:01.367 --> 00:00:03.770
Here's a surprise
about The White House.

00:00:03.803 --> 00:00:06.372
The paintings come alive
at night

00:00:06.405 --> 00:00:10.543
after I've taken
my anti-baldness medication.

00:00:10.576 --> 00:00:12.879
Look who's
in the painting today.

00:00:12.912 --> 00:00:16.749
It's President Andrew Jackson,
Old Hickory Dickory.

00:00:16.782 --> 00:00:19.819
Let's see if we can wake him up.

00:00:19.852 --> 00:00:23.589
Wake up! Wake up! Wake up! Wake
up! Wake up! Wake up! Wake up!

00:00:23.622 --> 00:00:26.959
What? What is happening?
Where am I?

00:00:26.992 --> 00:00:29.762
Why, this looks
like The White House.

00:00:29.795 --> 00:00:31.330
And who might you be?

00:00:31.363 --> 00:00:32.932
I'm the president.

00:00:32.965 --> 00:00:34.734
Oh, boy, oh, boy.

00:00:34.767 --> 00:00:36.636
I'm so glad you're here.

00:00:36.669 --> 00:00:39.972
I told everybody that you would
have prevented the Civil War.

00:00:40.005 --> 00:00:43.609
Uh, no, Mr. President,
I didn't fight in the Civil War.

00:00:43.642 --> 00:00:45.912
I fought in the War of 1812.

00:00:45.945 --> 00:00:48.881
18 to 12-- the forbidden years.

00:00:48.914 --> 00:00:50.316
(laughter)

00:00:50.349 --> 00:00:52.752
Okay.

00:00:52.785 --> 00:00:55.488
The Civil War
was a total disaster.

00:00:55.521 --> 00:00:57.490
Why did it have to happen?

00:00:57.523 --> 00:00:59.525
I can't believe
I'm the only person

00:00:59.558 --> 00:01:01.327
to ever ask that question.

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.030
And you were the only man
who could have stopped it.

00:01:04.063 --> 00:01:06.732
I don't think that's true.

00:01:06.765 --> 00:01:08.868
You know,
between my time in office

00:01:08.901 --> 00:01:10.603
and the start of the Civil War,

00:01:10.636 --> 00:01:12.472
there were nine
other presidents.

00:01:12.505 --> 00:01:14.407
Also, I was dead.

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.342
No, no, no. No, no.

00:01:16.375 --> 00:01:19.011
You would've prevented it.
Don't be modest.

00:01:19.044 --> 00:01:20.980
I don't know what you're...

00:01:21.013 --> 00:01:23.649
Well, I sent a war ship
to South Carolina

00:01:23.682 --> 00:01:26.285
to enforce Federal law
against nullification.

00:01:26.318 --> 00:01:28.020
Is that
what you're talking about?

00:01:28.053 --> 00:01:29.856
Absolutely.

00:01:29.889 --> 00:01:32.024
One of the greats.
One of the greats.

00:01:32.057 --> 00:01:33.392
Am I?

00:01:33.425 --> 00:01:36.095
A lot of stuff I did
hasn't aged well.

00:01:36.128 --> 00:01:38.564
(laughter)

00:01:38.597 --> 00:01:41.100
I... I owned hundreds of slaves.

00:01:41.133 --> 00:01:43.569
I legalized genocide
against the Indian tribes.

00:01:43.602 --> 00:01:47.073
But in the end, you took
one look at the Civil War,

00:01:47.106 --> 00:01:49.809
and you said,
"Not on my watch!"

00:01:49.842 --> 00:01:53.346
Listen to me! I had nothing
to do with the Civil War!

00:01:53.379 --> 00:01:57.783
I wasn't mad about it
because I didn't see it coming

00:01:57.816 --> 00:02:00.853
because I couldn't have seen it
coming because I was dead!

00:02:00.886 --> 00:02:02.755
(laughter)

00:02:02.788 --> 00:02:05.124
-Is this your cup?
-What?!

00:02:05.157 --> 00:02:07.260
I found this old cup,
and I said,

00:02:07.293 --> 00:02:09.729
"This is definitely
Jackson's cup."

00:02:09.762 --> 00:02:12.064
I've been drinking out of it
for weeks.

00:02:12.097 --> 00:02:13.399
It's got to be yours.

00:02:13.432 --> 00:02:15.034
I don't think so.

00:02:15.067 --> 00:02:16.836
Are you<i> sure </i>
it's not your cup?

00:02:16.869 --> 00:02:18.171
It's not my cup.

00:02:18.204 --> 00:02:20.239
I think it's yours.

00:02:20.272 --> 00:02:22.275
Okay, fine, it's my cup.

00:02:22.308 --> 00:02:24.844
Is there anything
you want to say to cup?

00:02:24.877 --> 00:02:27.613
Uh, hello, Cup.

00:02:27.646 --> 00:02:31.217
I love this.
This is history come alive.

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.486
You know what?
Come out of the painting!

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:36.822
Well, this whole thing
is just a hallucination

00:02:36.855 --> 00:02:39.692
caused by your anti-baldness
medication, so you're the boss.

00:02:39.725 --> 00:02:42.628
All right, whatever.

00:02:42.661 --> 00:02:44.630
-(applause and cheering)
-♪ ♪

00:02:44.663 --> 00:02:47.833
-Andrew Jackson, everybody.
-(applause and cheering)

00:02:47.866 --> 00:02:49.835
Andrew Jackson, everybody.

00:02:49.868 --> 00:02:51.704
Sit where Mike sits.

00:02:51.737 --> 00:02:54.440
Just sit where Mike sits,
right next to Cup.

00:02:54.473 --> 00:02:56.809
Not my cup.

00:02:56.842 --> 00:02:58.945
Do you have any questions
about the future,

00:02:58.978 --> 00:03:01.247
President Andrew Jackson?

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.950
Sure. Are we still
at war with the Indians?

00:03:03.983 --> 00:03:06.085
Sort of. We just ran
a rickety pipeline

00:03:06.118 --> 00:03:07.587
through their sacred land.

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.455
Love that.

00:03:09.488 --> 00:03:11.524
Um, what about slavery?

00:03:11.557 --> 00:03:12.992
How did that all shake out?

00:03:13.025 --> 00:03:16.162
Well, I hate to break it to you,
but there's no more slavery.

00:03:16.195 --> 00:03:18.598
-Aw.
-But...

00:03:18.631 --> 00:03:22.068
But we do have an incredible
prison industrial complex

00:03:22.101 --> 00:03:25.638
that locks up black people
and makes them work for nothing.

00:03:25.671 --> 00:03:27.473
Hey, pretty much the same thing!

00:03:27.506 --> 00:03:29.308
Wow. See?

00:03:29.341 --> 00:03:30.509
(applause)

00:03:30.542 --> 00:03:33.312
Steve was right--
I<i> am</i> just like you.

00:03:33.345 --> 00:03:35.448
You are way cooler than Mike.

00:03:35.481 --> 00:03:37.750
PENCE:
Uh, sir? Sir?

00:03:37.783 --> 00:03:39.752
Mike, where the hell are you?

00:03:39.785 --> 00:03:42.822
Uh, trapped in the painting,
sir!

00:03:42.855 --> 00:03:45.091
Oh, Jesus, Mike.

00:03:45.124 --> 00:03:47.026
All right, yeah,
we'll get you out.

00:03:47.059 --> 00:03:49.525
-Please.
-We're not gonna get him out.
