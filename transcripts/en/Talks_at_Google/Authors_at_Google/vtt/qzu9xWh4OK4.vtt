00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:19.570
Please help me in welcoming Ben Huh to Google.

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:20.570
&gt;&gt; [Clapping]

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:21.570
Ben Huh: Thanks, everybody, for being here
today.

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:22.570
I really appreciate it.
It's really nice to come and talk to Google

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:23.570
like this, because you guys impact so much
of our lives -- especially the way we actually

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:25.029
communicate the things that we find funny.
I'm sure a lot of lolcats have passed through

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:36.750
the pipes of Google over the last couple years.
So I'm here to talk about what I call "microhumor."

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.630
And this is the part of humor that gets largely
ignored by mass media.

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:47.070
And I think, in order to understand microhumor,
I'll start by explaining the other humor that

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.660
we are normally used to.
And, by the way, that's my Twitter name.

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:57.210
If you want to tweet this and tell me what
you think, I'd be more than happy to read

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.840
that and include your feedback in my next
presentation.

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:04.930
So, I'm going to start with a magic quadrant.
So we've got 'Reach' -- which is mass reach,

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:07.920
or private.
So basically, it's a meaning of exposure -- how

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.360
many people know about this specific subject
item.

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.460
And then, we go to 'Acceptance', which is
 -- Some things are not really funny for a

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.420
lot of people, and some things are funny to
a lot of people, whether they know it or not.

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:26.860
And I call it the "I agree it's lol" axis.
And when you put the two together, you get

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.890
a quadrant like this.
You've got "Ooh, that's awkward."

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:33.520
You've got the "Mass Stardom".
You've got "Microhumor", which is what I'm

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.850
here to talk about today mostly.
And then, you have the, "Dude, you have to

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.280
see this."
Unfortunately, the two -- upper-left and lower-right

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.760
 -- I really don't have a great name for it.
So that's why they're a little bit longer

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:45.290
than the other two.
So, I'm actually going to overlay, over this

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:48.940
magic quadrant, the humor and the type of
content that we're used to.

00:01:48.940 --> 00:02:05.570
So this slide might take a little bit to read.
[pause] So, you've got Ben Stiller movies,

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:10.530
which I think they've become more moved to
the right ever since he did "Tropic Thunder",

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.460
right?
And then, you've got like racist jokes and

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:16.490
sexist jokes that like, most people don't
agree are funny, but maybe they think it's

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:20.049
funny in private.
But everybody knows that it exists, right?

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:23.870
And you've got the inside joke, which is on
the bottom left hand corner -- the jokes that

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.290
we only tell our friends.
This is the type of content that a lot of

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:31.720
us are actually getting really used to today
 -- through Twitter, through e-mails, through

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.230
IM'ing, where we're sharing a little bit of
our lives.

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:39.269
And this is like the stuff that's overheard,
or maybe the Quote Board in its form, back

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:41.540
in the day.
You know, if you remember those things from

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.040
your dorm life, this is where it all starts,
right? -- the inside joke.

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:52.199
So I'm going to take an example of puns, which
is a type of humor format we're very familiar

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:55.320
with.
And puns can range from, "Ooh, that's really

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.820
awkward.
Like, that's really not that funny, but I

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:00.449
know that that's a pun."
All the way to, you know, there are some really

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:03.920
great puns out there.
Like, actually I can't really think of one

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:08.070
right now.
But most of the like, you know, hair salon,

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:12.850
and the pet news headline puns kind of fall
under the, "Ooh, that's awkward," category,

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:15.590
right?
We've seen them all like, what is it?

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:19.880
Great clips. Oh, I get it -- you clip my hair.
Ha ha, right?

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:27.970
So, I'm going to take this quadrant and analyze
a mean that we're very familiar with.

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:32.410
[laughter] I've saved you the trouble of actually
not playing this video.

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:40.440
So I will not actually Rickroll you.
That's the best applause I've gotten all year.

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:44.630
So, I'm going to talk about how Rickrolling
started, right?

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:48.870
It started as Duckrolling, which was on 4chan
boards.

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:52.680
They used to post a picture of a duck and
you click a link and like, "Oh, I got Duckrolled,

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.579
right?"
So it's a very private thing.

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:59.380
A lot of people on 4chan found it funny.
But it moved, right?

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:04.320
It moved when it became Rickrolling.
It was still private, but most people Rick

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:07.540
Astley's far funnier than a wooden duck.
Go figure, right?

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:12.540
So it moved to Rickrolling, right?
So this is a mean as it grows and evolves.

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:18.450
And then, it hit a mass and consensus, which
was when YouTube decided on April 1st, 2008,

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:21.650
to Rickroll everybody, by changing their links
on the home page.

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:27.259
Like, this was the total, you know, peak of
this mean.

00:04:27.259 --> 00:04:32.940
And then afterwards -- after April first -- after
everybody had seen it, it kind of died off,

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:35.160
and said, "Okay, I've been Rickrolled sixteen
times in a day.

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:37.780
You know, how many more times can I take the
same joke?"

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:41.750
So it actually moved from one quadrant all
the way to all four.

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:47.310
And let me tell you why it moves.
It moves from one quadrant to another, this

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:54.370
little humor that was inside joke within 4chan,
I always distract my own audience by posting

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:58.550
lolcats.
It moved, because it's evolutionary, right?

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:02.020
It was a Duckroll, which wasn't as funny as
Rick Astley.

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:06.040
And then, people thought, "You know, being
able to prank somebody by making a link go

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:10.120
to a different place that we all assume is
one thing then appears to be something really

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:14.530
ridiculous, it's a part of collective truism.
Meaning, we actually understand this to be

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:17.461
true internally, whether we had witnessed
this previously or not.

00:05:17.461 --> 00:05:21.220
Timeliness -- April 1st, right?
April Fool's Day.

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:25.550
What a great day to do a joke.
So, as the mean grew, it hit this peak, because,

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:27.860
"Hey, everybody needed a prank, right?
April 1st."

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:33.650
So YouTube picked this thing and made it huge.
And marketing -- because YouTube is so giant,

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:39.150
in terms of the world of videos, it had the
biggest platform available for this mean to

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:41.680
go viral.
And you can literally see that on Google Trends.

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:48.000
So in 2007 -- this is Google Trends of people
Googling for the word 'Rickrolling'.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.950
So it started as Duckrolling.
Nobody was looking for 'Duckrolling'.

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:54.570
Nobody cared; it was a private joke.
When it moved to another quadrant as more

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:57.310
and more people discovered it, people were
trying to find out what Rickrolling was, and

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:01.460
they were Googling it.
April Fool's, it peaked.

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:06.340
Everybody, who previously wasn't aware of
Rickrolling, now knew exactly what it was

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:08.780
 -- thanks to YouTube.
And then, afterwards, you can see, it died

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:10.340
down.
It ended up at a slightly higher peak than

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:13.950
before, but it's actually drifted off even
more so since then.

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:20.750
So you can see how this internal mean humor
went viral literally by looking at Google

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:23.500
Trends.
Well, so let's go back and define microhumor,

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:27.560
where this thing came from.
And I'm going to overanalyze.

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:33.300
I love this one.
This was actually one of the very first photos

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:37.550
I posted on the FAIL blog.
The expression on her face is just priceless

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:40.370
if you can see that.
And then, the fact that the frisbee was within

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:45.800
arm's reach, just outside.
It just makes this perfect.

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:49.490
So this was an inside joke.
A guy, who was taking photos of a frisbee

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:53.889
match, decided that he wanted to send this
photo around to his friends.

00:06:53.889 --> 00:06:58.910
And his friends decided that this was so funny
that, they suggest that he send it to FAIL

00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:00.420
blog.
And we posted it.

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:05.580
Well, prior to invention of a FAIL blog -- and
other things like it -- this would have been

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:09.190
just an inside joke, "Ha ha, whatever her
name is fell on her face. Face plant. That's

00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:13.240
really funny."
Well, this is exactly where all Internet means

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:15.949
start.
This little subculture -- this little subgroup

00:07:15.949 --> 00:07:19.389
 -- who find something to be compelling enough
to share with other people.

00:07:19.389 --> 00:07:24.150
Unless you can actually overcome the resistance
within that small subculture, where they all

00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:28.050
agree that this is worth sharing, the mean
never makes it out of that group.

00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:31.950
So what usually happens is, when you guys
have an inside joke, right?

00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:37.373
A very good example of an inside joke that
made it out is, what is it?

00:07:37.373 --> 00:07:41.430
"That's what she said," right?
Or "your mama." That's pretty bad.

00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:44.110
But, you know, "That's what she said" can
be applied to a lot of different things.

00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:46.630
It's a mean.
Whether we know it as an Internet mean or

00:07:46.630 --> 00:07:52.240
not, we tend to use the word 'mean' according
to the Internet, but that went from person

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:56.140
to person practically overnight.
Like, I don't know exactly what started -- and

00:07:56.140 --> 00:07:59.120
usually with means, you can't really pinpoint
the beginning of it.

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:05.389
But "That's what she said" became an idea
that everybody kind of learned without explicitly

00:08:05.389 --> 00:08:10.470
learning it.
So, let's describe what is microhumor and

00:08:10.470 --> 00:08:12.960
what is not.
It isn't web two point whatever.

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:18.010
It isn't new. It isn't really a mean.
It isn't Internet-based.

00:08:18.010 --> 00:08:24.000
And it is not the root of all humor.
What it is, is that, it's the first exposure

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:29.090
to humor we've had as kids, right?
When you guys were talking with your other,

00:08:29.090 --> 00:08:33.349
you know, third-grade friends and somebody
said something funny and it was because the

00:08:33.349 --> 00:08:37.599
context of being a third grader in your little
sandpit, you know, somebody did something

00:08:37.599 --> 00:08:41.399
funny, but you didn't recognize that as a
mass-media thing.

00:08:41.399 --> 00:08:45.290
You laughed and you forgot about it and you
moved on.

00:08:45.290 --> 00:08:48.180
It's most of why we laugh.
The fact that I'm here today talking to you

00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:53.370
about Internet means is relevant to this subculture,
or this subgroup of people, right?

00:08:53.370 --> 00:08:57.350
We're pretty much a very small community in
the grand scheme of the world.

00:08:57.350 --> 00:09:00.460
Not a lot of people work for the biggest technology
company in the world, right?

00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:04.240
Not a lot of people spend most of their lives
on the Internet, like I do, right?

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:08.670
We share very much a commonality that we appreciate
Internet culture for what it is -- something

00:09:08.670 --> 00:09:11.820
that's funny to us.
And it is more intimate.

00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:16.540
And this is one of the reasons why microhumor
tends to make it out, when it's really good,

00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:18.800
because we feel somewhat of an ownership of
it.

00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:23.590
We feel passionate about that little joke,
and we want to share it with the rest of the

00:09:23.590 --> 00:09:29.060
world.
So, before mass media, microhumor was the

00:09:29.060 --> 00:09:32.450
Force, right?
Maybe it was the Dark Side, maybe it wasn't.

00:09:32.450 --> 00:09:34.370
But this was the thing that we were all used
to.

00:09:34.370 --> 00:09:39.730
Like, in the Middle Ages, the Court -- the
King's Court, the Queen's Court -- had a jester.

00:09:39.730 --> 00:09:44.260
And the jester would make fun of other, you
know, members of the royal family, or maybe

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:47.570
he or she got beheaded for that.
But you know, maybe like other things that

00:09:47.570 --> 00:09:51.220
the king knew about, they wanted to share
this thing called microhumor -- things that

00:09:51.220 --> 00:09:55.820
were contextually relevant and funny to that
group of people.

00:09:55.820 --> 00:10:01.870
However, things changed when mass media came
into view, right?

00:10:01.870 --> 00:10:05.880
So if you look at the potential economic value
of different types of humor.

00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:12.420
When TV came into view.
The big, upper right quadrant -- meaning things

00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:16.210
that's funny to a lot of people -- got the
money, right?

00:10:16.210 --> 00:10:22.089
The balance completely became out of whack.
Whereas before, in the age before mass media,

00:10:22.089 --> 00:10:26.300
the inside joke was the only thing that held
sway, because we didn't have the ability to

00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:28.150
communicate with other people and share this
joke.

00:10:28.150 --> 00:10:34.570
So the balance went from microhumor all the
way to, you know, the stardom part, and nothing

00:10:34.570 --> 00:10:37.580
in between.
Well, the Internet is changing that, as you

00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:48.170
can clearly see and experience, right?
I'm going to let you laugh at this first.

00:10:48.170 --> 00:10:50.780
[laughter]
This would never make it on television. [laughter]

00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:55.680
It just doesn't work.
But we find it really funny.

00:10:55.680 --> 00:11:01.790
What we're doing is, we're refragmenting humor
in mass media, mass culture.

00:11:01.790 --> 00:11:06.180
More people can find more things funny.
Our tastes have become broader.

00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:11.260
Our tastes have become more eccentric almost.
And we're taking the power away from mass

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:15.630
media -- such as television and radio -- into
our own hands, because we can go and find

00:11:15.630 --> 00:11:19.620
and share and filter the things that we find
funny that maybe other people don't.

00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:24.000
It's because we can now publish things easily,
because we can access and find things.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.520
We can find other people who share the same
sense of humor.

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:29.270
And there's a feedback group that says, "Hey,
that was funny.

00:11:29.270 --> 00:11:33.080
I think this is funnier."
That's why means work, because it requires

00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:37.470
a two-directional effort in trying to make
something evolve to the next level.

00:11:37.470 --> 00:11:43.140
So we're growing -- these nuts -- right?
These crazy Internet people with their weird

00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:45.870
sense of humor of captioning cat photos with
misspelled words.

00:11:45.870 --> 00:11:49.760
Where the hell do they come from?
TV got, you know, kind of blind-sided by this.

00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:53.240
Or mass media got blind-sided.
That's why they're so interested in this story

00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:58.380
called lolcats and FAIL blog and Graph Jam,
because well, who the heck liked this stuff

00:11:58.380 --> 00:12:01.790
before TV was around?
Well, we probably did, but there was no way

00:12:01.790 --> 00:12:04.390
to access it.
There was no way to share the fact that we

00:12:04.390 --> 00:12:10.560
liked it.
And if you look at this ridiculous slide of

00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:15.230
people, right?
Evolution of dance, Chuck Norris.

00:12:15.230 --> 00:12:18.940
I mean talk about a mean.
Chuck Norris, who practically is a has-been

00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:24.029
on television, got a second wind, thanks to
Chuck Norris "facts," right?

00:12:24.029 --> 00:12:26.380
These ridiculous sayings about what Chuck
Norris could do.

00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:28.700
He can count to infinity twice.
I mean, it's like -- [laughter] You know,

00:12:28.700 --> 00:12:33.070
it's ridiculous, right?
Like behind his beard is a fist.

00:12:33.070 --> 00:12:38.649
[laughter] Dr. Horrible Sing-Along Blog.
Has anybody seen that one?

00:12:38.649 --> 00:12:41.730
Oh yeah, see?
Okay, I'm talking to the right audience, right?

00:12:41.730 --> 00:12:44.970
That was created, because the TV writers went
on strike.

00:12:44.970 --> 00:12:49.450
And they had free time, and they wanted to
create a drama that they enjoyed.

00:12:49.450 --> 00:12:54.500
It's really quirky.
It features Dudy Hauser, right?

00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:59.399
I mean what an awesome guy, right?
And that never would have been made, if it

00:12:59.399 --> 00:13:01.410
wasn't for the Internet.
It was released online.

00:13:01.410 --> 00:13:05.430
iTunes picked it up.
We all saw it, because it wasn't on TV.

00:13:05.430 --> 00:13:08.820
We saw it online.
And we probably told our friends about it.

00:13:08.820 --> 00:13:13.459
There was no marketing budget.
Taze All Day, [singing] Chocolate Rain.

00:13:13.459 --> 00:13:18.240
Yeah, that's pretty inside there.
This is a case where a very not-talented person

00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:22.720
got on the Internet, decided that he wanted
to be talented and made an absolutely ridiculous

00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:27.500
song called "Chocolate Rain," which I don't
even want to think about.

00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:30.350
So, and he ended up in a Dr. Pepper commercial,
right?

00:13:30.350 --> 00:13:35.290
So this is a case where, again, some subgroup
of people decided that this was so ridiculous

00:13:35.290 --> 00:13:39.400
that they wanted to share it with other people.
I won't go through everything, but as you

00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:48.520
can see, things like this is how it all starts.
So this is actually not the oldest lolcat

00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:51.370
by the way.
This is a poster from the 70's.

00:13:51.370 --> 00:13:55.970
The oldest lolcat that we found -- and I wish
I would have brought the picture with me.

00:13:55.970 --> 00:14:00.440
It was printed, as far as I can tell, 1904.
And I'm not kidding.

00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:05.360
Somebody who went to an antique store in Seattle,
found this postcard of a kitten sitting in

00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:09.970
a highchair dressed up like a little girl,
and there's an all-caps caption underneath

00:14:09.970 --> 00:14:17.290
the photo that said, "Mommy, where's my dinner?"
If it had made an impact, like done! That's

00:14:17.290 --> 00:14:19.600
a lolcat, right?
It wasn't even a predecessor.

00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:24.310
That would have been an actual lolcat.
And this was because -- this was the beginning

00:14:24.310 --> 00:14:27.110
days of photography.
They wanted to, I guess, make postcards that

00:14:27.110 --> 00:14:31.800
other people bought.
So the idea of captioning a cat is not new.

00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:36.610
I'm pretty sure if you go to Egypt, somewhere
in the pyramids, [laughter] there's a cat

00:14:36.610 --> 00:14:41.190
with a caption underneath it.
"Mommy, can I have a Sycophagus?"

00:14:41.190 --> 00:14:45.220
I don't know. [laughter]
So, I'm going to go back and talk a little

00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:52.860
bit about how we all got started.
So Eric and Kerry, the cofounders of I Can

00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:55.899
Has Cheezburger actually came here and talked
to you guys about a year ago about the founding

00:14:55.899 --> 00:14:58.490
of I Can Has Cheezburger.
And they can tell you about how it just went

00:14:58.490 --> 00:15:03.790
from having a blog that had a couple of pictures
of lolcats to this massive, you know, Internet

00:15:03.790 --> 00:15:09.029
phenomenon practically overnight.
I showed up sometime in April, as the site

00:15:09.029 --> 00:15:11.500
was taking off.
And the first time I saw it, I didn't get

00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:14.029
it.
Second time somebody sent me a link, I didn't

00:15:14.029 --> 00:15:18.339
get it.
By the third time, I said, "Jeez, I'm not

00:15:18.339 --> 00:15:22.890
going to go there again," but I did.
And then, I found something I liked.

00:15:22.890 --> 00:15:26.170
Something that appealed to my sense of humor.
And then, I sent it to my friends.

00:15:26.170 --> 00:15:28.550
I said, "Dude, you got to check this out."
Right?

00:15:28.550 --> 00:15:32.459
That's like microhumor in action.
It appealed -- some context of that joke appealed

00:15:32.459 --> 00:15:34.290
to me.
I wish I could remember which one that was.

00:15:34.290 --> 00:15:37.310
And I said, "I have to share it with my friends
who share my sense of humor."

00:15:37.310 --> 00:15:43.080
And the site continued to grow.
And in September, that's when I took over,

00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:55.720
we knew absolutely nothing about how to run
this blog. [laughter]

00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:59.360
That's exactly how I felt.
What is this blog?

00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:04.550
How do you get these pictures?
So, in September, we realize that -- just

00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:08.769
like microhumor -- the good solutions are
the really simple solutions.

00:16:08.769 --> 00:16:13.580
So we focused on just making sure that you
guys got the lolcats that you wanted.

00:16:13.580 --> 00:16:18.740
And we started growing like crazy.
So that's millions of pays to the left by

00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:21.010
the way.
And we were profitable from day one, which

00:16:21.010 --> 00:16:24.120
was the other crazy part.
So when I raised investment money to purchase

00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:27.470
I Can Has Cheezburger on these little blogs,
you know, the investor said, "Well, how much

00:16:27.470 --> 00:16:29.730
am I going to have to put in, because can
you make money off this?"

00:16:29.730 --> 00:16:34.310
And I said, "Yeah, we can actually make money."
That was kind of the watershed moment, when

00:16:34.310 --> 00:16:38.680
we had our first month's worth of revenues
come in, and said, "Oh, my God, we actually

00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:43.089
didn't lose anything."
And we kept on growing, which is very contradictory

00:16:43.089 --> 00:16:47.370
to what people believe about how new media
works. [laughter]

00:16:47.370 --> 00:17:01.200
Yeah, this one takes a few seconds, so.
We were a blog, posting weird cat photos and

00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:05.579
turning a profit, whereas other people doing
great work, creating great content, weren't.

00:17:05.579 --> 00:17:10.010
And there's something weird about that.
And we kept on growing.

00:17:10.010 --> 00:17:17.419
And we added more blogs.
I'm sure you know about FAIL blog and Graph

00:17:17.419 --> 00:17:20.630
Jam.
FAIL blog we actually acquired from a guy

00:17:20.630 --> 00:17:25.409
in London in April of 2008.
And I think that's the last big acquisition

00:17:25.409 --> 00:17:29.320
that we're going to do, because the world
has really changed since we started doing

00:17:29.320 --> 00:17:31.452
this.
We've created this kind of cottage industry

00:17:31.452 --> 00:17:35.759
of people who post pictures online and try
to make a living off it, which is bizarre,

00:17:35.759 --> 00:17:39.649
because in two years, that is a really, really
fast turn around.

00:17:39.649 --> 00:17:43.129
Before we were really in existence, no one
knew that you could actually make a living

00:17:43.129 --> 00:17:46.059
doing this.
And now, there's a bunch of people who like,

00:17:46.059 --> 00:17:50.269
have a part-time job at home, posting pictures
of whatever it is they find funny.

00:17:50.269 --> 00:17:55.090
And the odds of them actually making money
are very slim, but so is becoming a Hollywood

00:17:55.090 --> 00:17:58.779
star, and people try anyway, right?
It's this idea that you can affect the world

00:17:58.779 --> 00:18:01.540
with your sense of humor that seems to be
virally infectious to other people.

00:18:01.540 --> 00:18:08.140
And I have no idea why I included this slide.
[laughter]

00:18:08.140 --> 00:18:15.820
Rest in peace, Michael Jackson/dude from Egypt.
So, we found the same idea to be true, that

00:18:15.820 --> 00:18:17.860
we could go out and buy blogs if we wanted
to.

00:18:17.860 --> 00:18:20.639
But we could also build our own, like "Totally
Looks Like."

00:18:20.639 --> 00:18:24.520
This idea was inspired by -- you guys remember
Mad Magazine?

00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:30.440
They used to have a feature called "Separate
at Birth," I think, which would feature like,

00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:33.340
two celebrities.
That's where this came from.

00:18:33.340 --> 00:18:37.260
All we did was, we just made a place online
where you can submit your own.

00:18:37.260 --> 00:18:42.210
And then, "Totally Looks Like" was born.
So, as we added our blogs, we kept on growing

00:18:42.210 --> 00:18:48.259
and growing and growing.
So that's August 2008.

00:18:48.259 --> 00:18:50.749
And I'll also share with you our planning
philosophy.

00:18:50.749 --> 00:18:52.999
And we said, "You know, what we're doing is
working so well."

00:18:52.999 --> 00:18:57.110
It's a little hard to read, but this is a
song. [laughter]

00:18:57.110 --> 00:19:03.330
Got some music. You just got it?
Okay. It takes a while. But anyway.

00:19:03.330 --> 00:19:08.690
That's what Graph Jam is all about.
But we decided that 30 days of planning was

00:19:08.690 --> 00:19:11.600
just enough.
That we did not have to plan out years in

00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:14.821
advance, because let's face it, we're a cat
blog.

00:19:14.821 --> 00:19:20.820
And when you are a cat blog, you just want
to live till tomorrow.

00:19:20.820 --> 00:19:25.279
And this has worked really well for us, just
focusing on what we do well, posting other

00:19:25.279 --> 00:19:28.659
people's content that are funny according
to other people's standards.

00:19:28.659 --> 00:19:32.019
Because if you go to our site, you'll realize
everything is voted upon.

00:19:32.019 --> 00:19:34.350
Like, we don't sit there and go, "We think
this is funny."

00:19:34.350 --> 00:19:38.190
We let the users decide.
So not only do we crowd source our material,

00:19:38.190 --> 00:19:43.460
we crowd filter the best of the best.
So people started calling us a "user-generated,

00:19:43.460 --> 00:19:50.379
content pioneer," which is a very nice label.
Which is like saying, well, the earth would

00:19:50.379 --> 00:19:56.030
be mass media, and user-generated content
would be the sun, because we create so much

00:19:56.030 --> 00:19:57.169
content.
You know, Blogger?

00:19:57.169 --> 00:19:59.440
My God, there's so much content on Blogger,
right?

00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:04.919
So basically what "UGC pioneer" means, people
crazy enough to go sift through all this stuff

00:20:04.919 --> 00:20:07.740
out there, right?
That's all we're doing is trying to figure

00:20:07.740 --> 00:20:11.669
out how to take the best of what people are
creating and send it and show it to the right

00:20:11.669 --> 00:20:15.700
audience.
And this is our traffic growth.

00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:21.669
This is for until last month.
We exceeded 200 million page views.

00:20:21.669 --> 00:20:26.100
And now, we're on pace to do a billion pages
every four months.

00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:30.649
And, oddly enough, we now have the number
sixth all-time watched channel on YouTube

00:20:30.649 --> 00:20:35.879
thanks to FAIL blog.
So FAIL blog's videos came in about sixteen

00:20:35.879 --> 00:20:38.470
months ago, eighteen months ago.
Somebody sent us a video and said, "You should

00:20:38.470 --> 00:20:41.350
post this on FAIL blog."
And I said, "We don't post videos on FAIL

00:20:41.350 --> 00:20:47.619
blog. This is a photo blog, dammit!"
Well, we posted it anyway, because I got overruled,

00:20:47.619 --> 00:20:53.759
and it grew and it grew and it grew.
And we just passed CBS as the sixth most-watched

00:20:53.759 --> 00:20:58.710
channel on YouTube of all time in 18 months.
I mean, that's just crazy, right?

00:20:58.710 --> 00:21:05.710
It's just videos of people failing. [laughter]
Sometimes videos of professionals failing,

00:21:05.710 --> 00:21:09.230
but it's not rocket science.
It really isn't.

00:21:09.230 --> 00:21:12.419
And a lot of these videos had been seen by
other people before, and what we did was,

00:21:12.419 --> 00:21:17.979
we used crowd sourcing to put that in front
of a wide audience and to allow them to decide

00:21:17.979 --> 00:21:21.979
what they believed was good.
That's all it was.

00:21:21.979 --> 00:21:26.070
Also, the financial crisis helped, which then
the word 'fail' came [undecipherable]

00:21:26.070 --> 00:21:31.729
So, let's think about this.
April 2008, I buy the blog, it starts growing.

00:21:31.729 --> 00:21:34.889
September of 2008, the financial crisis happened,
and banks fail.

00:21:34.889 --> 00:21:38.970
And there's a photo of some person at a Senate
hearing of the banks.

00:21:38.970 --> 00:21:42.269
And she is holding a sign that says, "Fail."
[laughter]

00:21:42.269 --> 00:21:46.309
I remember looking at that picture going,
"I better buy some more servers."

00:21:46.309 --> 00:21:51.419
[laughter] And that was it.
And that's our story so far.

00:21:51.419 --> 00:21:55.999
We keep launching a new blog every week.
I'm trying to test out what is funny and what

00:21:55.999 --> 00:21:58.109
isn't.
The latest blog that we launched is a little,

00:21:58.109 --> 00:22:01.039
cute, baby product blog.
So we basically -- you know, I was talking

00:22:01.039 --> 00:22:03.259
to Molly Wood, who's the executive editor
at CNET.

00:22:03.259 --> 00:22:07.729
And she was basically telling me, "You guys
basically live in the world of extreme, making

00:22:07.729 --> 00:22:09.940
fun of other people's failures or really cute
stuff."

00:22:09.940 --> 00:22:14.239
And I'm like, "Oh, I didn't really know that."
"Like you guys," she said, "were basically

00:22:14.239 --> 00:22:19.789
doing two extremes of happiness -- watching
other people's misery, or watching cute things."

00:22:19.789 --> 00:22:22.279
I'm like, "That's really good. Thanks.
I'm actually going to go back to the office

00:22:22.279 --> 00:22:25.720
and tell them about this."
And this is the best part about my job is

00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:29.379
that I comment and meet with other people
who visit our blogs and they tell us what

00:22:29.379 --> 00:22:34.239
to do.
Our mission statement is "To make people happy

00:22:34.239 --> 00:22:37.320
for five minutes a day."
And it's not some kind of wisdom I crafted

00:22:37.320 --> 00:22:40.559
from my little, windowless office.
It was actually something that was sent in

00:22:40.559 --> 00:22:43.679
to us by our users.
They kept on e-mailing us, and they said,

00:22:43.679 --> 00:22:48.229
"Hey, guys.
We love your blog, because it's my five-minute

00:22:48.229 --> 00:22:50.309
break from the office."
Or "I print out lolcats, and I take it to

00:22:50.309 --> 00:22:54.019
my grandmother who's recovering from cancer,
and we share a laugh over it.

00:22:54.019 --> 00:22:57.169
She has no idea that there's this stuff on
the Internet."

00:22:57.169 --> 00:23:00.710
You know? And that was really great.
And we adopted that as our mission statement.

00:23:00.710 --> 00:23:06.190
Because, for us, the microhumor -- the little
joys we share with other people -- is what

00:23:06.190 --> 00:23:08.999
we specialize in.
And if we can continue to make more blogs

00:23:08.999 --> 00:23:12.330
that make people laugh for just a few minutes,
then we've won.

00:23:12.330 --> 00:23:17.159
So that's it. That's me.
If you have any questions, feel free to send

00:23:17.159 --> 00:23:19.580
me an e-mail, and I'd love to take your questions.

00:23:19.580 --> 00:23:28.429
&gt;&gt; [Clapping]

00:23:28.429 --> 00:23:32.139
&gt;&gt; So if anyone has any questions, they can
go ahead and come up to the microphone.

00:23:32.139 --> 00:23:35.729
It'll be right here.
Go ahead and ask a question.

00:23:35.729 --> 00:23:37.139
Ben Huh: Don't feel too shy.

00:23:37.139 --> 00:23:44.929
&gt;&gt; Or I can come to you if you have a question,
if you prefer.

00:23:44.929 --> 00:23:51.320
Ben Huh: I'm going to find some photos to
show you guys.

00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:53.159
I think this was a crowd favorite.
Somebody post that one.

00:23:53.159 --> 00:23:54.529
There you go, that's how I roll.
I'm not sure how the cat got in there, but

00:23:54.529 --> 00:23:59.470
I'm pretty sure you can't force a cat into
a tube like that.

00:23:59.470 --> 00:24:08.489
Q Question from San Francisco.
Do you know what your all-time, most-visited

00:24:08.489 --> 00:24:09.499
photo is?

00:24:09.499 --> 00:24:12.639
Ben Huh: Our all-time, most-visited photo
varies.

00:24:12.639 --> 00:24:17.999
Because, as we grow, the photos that we post
at a later date tend to get the most views.

00:24:17.999 --> 00:24:21.039
So that's kind of a tricky question.
So people have asked us, "Can you guys do

00:24:21.039 --> 00:24:23.889
a Best Of?"
I'm like, "How do we decide that? I don't

00:24:23.889 --> 00:24:27.070
know, right?"
Because, as traffic grows, the stuff we post

00:24:27.070 --> 00:24:30.739
on the home page become more and more -- seen
by more people.

00:24:30.739 --> 00:24:35.009
So, I wish I knew that, actually.
That would be great.

00:24:35.009 --> 00:24:38.119
Q So would that be a cat roll?

00:24:38.119 --> 00:24:42.669
Ben Huh: That would be a cat roll.
There's also a subway cat, which is a similar

00:24:42.669 --> 00:24:48.119
cat, but in -- cat is by itself, and then,
it says 'Catway'.

00:24:48.119 --> 00:24:51.720
I'm not sure why that says 'Catway,' but it
does.

00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:59.100
Q It's great to have you here.
FAIL blog has worked its way into a meditative

00:24:59.100 --> 00:25:00.859
process that I have every night before I go
to bed. [laughter]

00:25:00.859 --> 00:25:05.169
I log into it and I start laughing, because
I used to look at the New York Times, and

00:25:05.169 --> 00:25:10.849
it just got so depressing.
I'll be rolling -- literally rolling -- on

00:25:10.849 --> 00:25:16.979
the floor, laughing, reading the thing.
And when my ex was living with me.

00:25:16.979 --> 00:25:19.280
She just never got it.

00:25:19.280 --> 00:25:20.669
Ben Huh: Is that why she's your ex? [laughter]

00:25:20.669 --> 00:25:21.929
Q Yeah, exactly. Exactly.

00:25:21.929 --> 00:25:26.820
Ben Huh: I'm great to have contributed to
the breakup of relationships.

00:25:26.820 --> 00:25:31.759
Q I won't go into that here.
But I mean, maybe you could talk a little

00:25:31.759 --> 00:25:35.429
bit more about the thing you touched on in
the mean like, people kind of get it.

00:25:35.429 --> 00:25:39.240
And people who don't.
Because I think not everybody gets it.

00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:43.279
Ben Huh: That's the interesting part about
what we do is that we're serving up humor

00:25:43.279 --> 00:25:45.910
in a very fragmented community.
Not everybody gets FAIL blog.

00:25:45.910 --> 00:25:48.559
Not everybody gets I Can Has Cheezburger.
Not everybody gets Graph Jam.

00:25:48.559 --> 00:25:50.640
But that's okay with me.
People say, "Well, this is not funny."

00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:53.309
I'm like, "That's okay.
Other people find it funny, and that's really

00:25:53.309 --> 00:25:56.360
who we're targeting."
So that's why we've got 28 blogs now.

00:25:56.360 --> 00:26:02.830
And we've gone from one cat blog to a network
of 28-plus blogs, where we try out new material

00:26:02.830 --> 00:26:04.730
every week.
It's like being a stand-up comedian.

00:26:04.730 --> 00:26:09.159
If it doesn't work, we won't use it again.
So, we launched "There, I Fixed It," which

00:26:09.159 --> 00:26:13.110
was leftover content from FAIL blog.
People would send us -- "There I Fixed It"

00:26:13.110 --> 00:26:18.999
is a site that features horrible fix-up jobs.
So like, that shower curtain that's actually

00:26:18.999 --> 00:26:21.780
not attached by rings -- but with like, duct
tape -- to the rod.

00:26:21.780 --> 00:26:25.609
So you have to basically climb under the curtain
to get in there.

00:26:25.609 --> 00:26:30.899
There's a ladder that's been apparently -- a
ladder that's replaced a staircase, and if

00:26:30.899 --> 00:26:34.440
you look closely, the ladder is actually bolted
into the wall, because it's been there so

00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:37.309
long.
And it's actually a ladder on top of a ladder,

00:26:37.309 --> 00:26:39.880
which makes me wonder if that house owner
is still alive.

00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:41.991
So, it's stuff like this that was sent to
the FAIL blog.

00:26:41.991 --> 00:26:44.399
We're like, "You know, this really isn't a
fail, because there's nobody actually falling

00:26:44.399 --> 00:26:48.169
off of it right now, but maybe we could start
something else." So we started, "There, I

00:26:48.169 --> 00:26:52.210
Fixed It."
So, it's things like this, where subcultures

00:26:52.210 --> 00:26:56.029
give us an idea into what they would like
to see, and that's what we try.

00:26:56.029 --> 00:26:57.029
Yeah.

00:26:57.029 --> 00:26:58.049
Q Just wondering.
I guess before lolcats came along, we had

00:26:58.049 --> 00:27:01.679
like all these really big forums of something
awful like -- I remember the days of the old

00:27:01.679 --> 00:27:03.580
really owl, which I love.

00:27:03.580 --> 00:27:04.729
Ben Huh: Yeah.

00:27:04.729 --> 00:27:13.210
Q And I was just wondering like, How -- have
you thought about that fact or how that in

00:27:13.210 --> 00:27:19.519
a sense kind of maybe grew into this sensation?
Or?

00:27:19.519 --> 00:27:22.669
Ben Huh: Actually, that's where it all came
from.

00:27:22.669 --> 00:27:27.269
So, lolcats -- as a phenomenon -- came from
4chan, which made its way out to "something

00:27:27.269 --> 00:27:31.909
awful" "for a phase" all of those forums I'm
sure you're aware of.

00:27:31.909 --> 00:27:36.450
And then, from there, it made a crossover
into kind of mass blogging world.

00:27:36.450 --> 00:27:38.109
And that's where I Can Has Cheezburger first
started.

00:27:38.109 --> 00:27:43.039
So lolcats was an invention of a very sick
group of people.

00:27:43.039 --> 00:27:48.909
Also very creative group of people, right?
FAIL -- it didn't really come from 4chan.

00:27:48.909 --> 00:27:54.309
Graph Jam came from a community on Flicker.
So all these ideas germinate from somewhere

00:27:54.309 --> 00:27:56.519
else.
And even then, if you think about it, those

00:27:56.519 --> 00:28:01.499
ideas germinated from a different era.
So there was a woman named Jessica Hagee,

00:28:01.499 --> 00:28:04.100
who's got a book that's really a bunch of
graphs that she draws.

00:28:04.100 --> 00:28:08.169
Veni Tree Martin is a comedian who draws graphs
as part of his comedy routine, and that's

00:28:08.169 --> 00:28:11.389
what was the inspiration for that.
And I'm sure they will tell you they were

00:28:11.389 --> 00:28:14.980
inspired by something else.
So, the idea of a mean actually having a starting

00:28:14.980 --> 00:28:20.849
point is really hard to pinpoint.
But yeah, those forums were a very big, influential

00:28:20.849 --> 00:28:23.960
group, because they created a lot of the content
that we know as the early lolcats today, so.

00:28:23.960 --> 00:28:24.960
Yeah. Any other questions?

00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:25.960
Q Question from San Francisco.

00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:26.960
Ben Huh: Yeah.

00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:27.960
Q Thanks for coming, by the way.
I really appreciate almost all of your blogs,

00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:28.960
so.
Thank you for wasting hours and hours and

00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:34.809
hours of my time in the best way.
So now, you were just talking about Graph

00:28:34.809 --> 00:28:48.929
Jam -- and maybe I missed it, but that's the
only one that's really your content, right?

00:28:48.929 --> 00:28:52.361
You guys are actually -- that's not user-submitted;
is it?

00:28:52.361 --> 00:28:56.090
Ben Huh: Graph Jam.
I think, if I heard your question correctly,

00:28:56.090 --> 00:28:57.519
the question is, Is Graph Jam user-submitted?

00:28:57.519 --> 00:28:58.640
Q Right.

00:28:58.640 --> 00:29:03.299
Ben Huh: Yeah, it's all user-submitted.
If you go to Graph Jam, there's a graph-builder/uploader,

00:29:03.299 --> 00:29:06.509
and you can go make your own graphs.
What was really fascinating -- it's a little

00:29:06.509 --> 00:29:10.029
flash builder, which allows you to make graphs
without actually punching in numbers.

00:29:10.029 --> 00:29:13.179
If you kind of think about that, that's really
crazy, right?

00:29:13.179 --> 00:29:16.950
Graphs without the use of numbers.
You can draw a pie chart just by dragging

00:29:16.950 --> 00:29:22.289
a line and going, "Ooh, look I think it's
about this much percent." [Laughter]

00:29:22.289 --> 00:29:25.620
Well, that's what we found out.
So we see all the submissions that come in

00:29:25.620 --> 00:29:27.519
through our system, because the moderator
looks at this stuff.

00:29:27.519 --> 00:29:29.799
And then, we started seeing actual, corporate,
company data.

00:29:29.799 --> 00:29:34.659
Like somebody decided Excel was too hard and
decided that they wanted to make a financial

00:29:34.659 --> 00:29:39.320
presentation out of using Graph Jam's graph-builder.
[laughter]

00:29:39.320 --> 00:29:42.509
Unfortunately, I do not know the name of this
company, because I would go short their stock

00:29:42.509 --> 00:29:46.529
tomorrow.
But yeah, people do this actually quite frequently,

00:29:46.529 --> 00:29:49.509
and it scares the bejesus out of me, because
I'm pretty sure there's another Enron brewing

00:29:49.509 --> 00:29:54.479
somewhere. [laughter]
Yeah, everything we do is user-submitted.

00:29:54.479 --> 00:29:58.289
We have a blog called, "It Made My Day," which
 -- if you've ever checked on Twitter.

00:29:58.289 --> 00:30:02.580
If you've seen the tag 'IMMD' on Twitter -- that's
where it comes from, a blog called, "It Made

00:30:02.580 --> 00:30:06.639
My Day," which is either about something really
nice that's happened to you, or something

00:30:06.639 --> 00:30:10.049
really bad that's happened to somebody else,
that you witnessed, so.

00:30:10.049 --> 00:30:11.489
It's just different forms of user-generated
content.

00:30:11.489 --> 00:30:12.489
Q I follow that actually. I'm sorry.

00:30:12.489 --> 00:30:13.489
Ben Huh: Go ahead.

00:30:13.489 --> 00:30:14.489
Q Can I ask one more?
"It Made My Day" -- I actually thought that

00:30:14.489 --> 00:30:20.070
was from the producers of FML, which I'll
leave that acronym there.

00:30:20.070 --> 00:30:26.130
But was that a response to FML?

00:30:26.130 --> 00:30:33.940
Ben Huh: That was absolutely response to FML.
The question was, Was IMMD inspired by FML?

00:30:33.940 --> 00:30:37.309
Absolutely true. It's like the opposite of
FML. All right?

00:30:37.309 --> 00:30:41.490
So in most cases, the opposite of whatever
we're doing tends to be also true, and also

00:30:41.490 --> 00:30:43.970
appeals to an audience.
And that's the thing about this fragmented

00:30:43.970 --> 00:30:47.840
audience is that, if we're doing one thing,
we might as well go do the opposite as well,

00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:51.049
so.
Yeah. There's a question back there, I think.

00:30:51.049 --> 00:30:52.049
Q [inaudible]

00:30:52.049 --> 00:30:57.269
Ben Huh: I'll just repeat the question.
How do we prevent abuse?

00:30:57.269 --> 00:31:00.259
Everything that's submitted to our system
is seen by a paid moderator.

00:31:00.259 --> 00:31:04.639
So what we do is, we have somebody who screens
all the photos as they come in, for 'terms

00:31:04.639 --> 00:31:07.499
of service' violations.
It's really expensive to do, and it's really

00:31:07.499 --> 00:31:11.159
laborious, but I feel it has a really positive
effect on the community.

00:31:11.159 --> 00:31:18.049
Like I can't imagine somebody at YouTube doing
this, because then, they'd be like, just bored

00:31:18.049 --> 00:31:20.190
out of their minds of all the cat videos that
come in.

00:31:20.190 --> 00:31:24.429
But you know, that's what we do, and it's
just part of our culture to actually pay for

00:31:24.429 --> 00:31:28.169
that service to do it.
But yeah, that's how we prevent abuse.

00:31:28.169 --> 00:31:32.379
&gt;&gt; Do we have any other questions from the
other offices, Tim? No.

00:31:32.379 --> 00:31:37.249
&gt;&gt; Yeah, we do actually. Question from Ann
Arbor.

00:31:37.249 --> 00:31:39.690
&gt;&gt; Go ahead, Ann Arbor.

00:31:39.690 --> 00:31:46.399
Q Oh, great, thanks.
Are you planning on expanding your merchandise

00:31:46.399 --> 00:31:50.669
at all, for I Can Has Cheezburger?

00:31:50.669 --> 00:31:54.419
Ben Huh: I'm sorry, could?
Are we planning on expanding merchandise?

00:31:54.419 --> 00:31:56.570
Yes, we actually are.
Thank you for that segway; I owe you five

00:31:56.570 --> 00:32:02.129
dollars. [laughter]
In November, we plan on launching an "Internet

00:32:02.129 --> 00:32:06.359
Mean T-shirt A Day" program.
So just like shirt.woot, but with Internet

00:32:06.359 --> 00:32:08.289
culture products.
So like, it's a shirt.

00:32:08.289 --> 00:32:11.999
Like, I wish I was wearing one.
It's like, I've got a red shirt.

00:32:11.999 --> 00:32:16.139
It's got like Long Cat on one, and it's got
like the big towers, like Sears Tower, or

00:32:16.139 --> 00:32:21.460
like all those things -- buildings.
And then, it'll have their feet, like number

00:32:21.460 --> 00:32:24.469
of feet -- 2000 feet or whatever.
And then, the long cat is like over 9,000

00:32:24.469 --> 00:32:25.559
feet.
You know, stuff like that.

00:32:25.559 --> 00:32:30.910
Just Internet sub-humor stuff like that.
We want to just do one T-shirt a day to make

00:32:30.910 --> 00:32:34.239
it limited.
And I think it would be a lot of fun, so.

00:32:34.239 --> 00:32:37.690
Yeah. You had a question.

00:32:37.690 --> 00:32:39.570
Q [inaudible]

00:32:39.570 --> 00:32:45.940
Ben Huh: Yeah, how long can we afford to pay
for human moderation?

00:32:45.940 --> 00:32:51.049
That's a very good question.
I think the answer is, "Until we can't."

00:32:51.049 --> 00:32:53.109
And I really don't know.
And this is kind of the philosophy of running

00:32:53.109 --> 00:32:56.070
a company '30 days at a time' is that, you
know, we're small enough where we can be very

00:32:56.070 --> 00:32:58.919
nimble.
And if we feel that the expenses are going

00:32:58.919 --> 00:33:02.809
out of line, we'll have to figure out an answer,
but until we have to do that, we're going

00:33:02.809 --> 00:33:05.669
to concentrate on what we do best, which is
launch new sites.

00:33:05.669 --> 00:33:08.129
I'm sure somebody, somewhere in my office,
is going to be screaming going, "Oh, my God!

00:33:08.129 --> 00:33:10.609
We spent that much on moderation?"
And we'll say, "Okay, let's take a look, and

00:33:10.609 --> 00:33:17.270
see how much value that is to us."
But we don't have any plans to phase it out.

00:33:17.270 --> 00:33:21.399
I think that's -- in fact, I think we only
have plans to increase it to 24-hours coverage.

00:33:21.399 --> 00:33:25.259
Because right now, they sit in a queue, unless
there's a moderator on staff.

00:33:25.259 --> 00:33:29.299
So there's three shifts of people who look
at this stuff every day.

00:33:29.299 --> 00:33:32.460
So we try to cover as much of the time clock
as possible.

00:33:32.460 --> 00:33:36.380
And we want to expand that.
Yes.

00:33:36.380 --> 00:33:37.500
Q [inaudible]

00:33:37.500 --> 00:33:42.529
Ben Huh: Where are our visitors coming from?
Yeah, we're about 65 percent United States

00:33:42.529 --> 00:33:46.999
and 35 percent international.
It tends to do with the fact that we have

00:33:46.999 --> 00:33:51.710
an English-language blog, so unless you understand
kind of western culture and know English well

00:33:51.710 --> 00:33:54.509
enough.
Because, you have to know English to understand

00:33:54.509 --> 00:33:59.299
when it's misspelled. [laughter]
And it's weird, because you have to know English

00:33:59.299 --> 00:34:04.379
well enough to understand when things are
really misspelled correctly, right? [laughter]

00:34:04.379 --> 00:34:08.579
So like Kara Swisher, who's a very famous
blogger and reporter for the Wall Street Journal

00:34:08.579 --> 00:34:10.429
 -- loves lolcats -- she posts lolcats on
our blog.

00:34:10.429 --> 00:34:14.530
So one of the things that we countered was,
people would have very interesting misconceived

00:34:14.530 --> 00:34:18.960
notions about why people misspell things.
So one lady came up to me and said, "You know,

00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:24.659
I like your lolcats, but I hate the fact that
you assume that my cats can't spell." [laughter]

00:34:24.659 --> 00:34:32.179
And my response was, "It's not that they can't
spell, it's that they choose not to spell

00:34:32.179 --> 00:34:37.840
like we do, because they're better than us."
And she's like, "Oh." [laughter]

00:34:37.840 --> 00:34:41.950
I mean, she had a very, you know, new-found
respect for her cat after that.

00:34:41.950 --> 00:34:47.081
So like Paul Krugman, the Nobel Prize winner
of Economist, used a lolcat on his blog.

00:34:47.081 --> 00:34:51.230
So these are people who are very intelligent,
and this is what I tell people, it's like,

00:34:51.230 --> 00:34:53.679
"No, they're not misspelling because they
don't know how to spell English."

00:34:53.679 --> 00:34:56.960
"No, it is not a form of ebonics," which happened
by the way.

00:34:56.960 --> 00:35:01.500
Somebody called the NAACP and said, "Lol cats
are racist." [laughter]

00:35:01.500 --> 00:35:05.470
Yeah, so. It's not that.
It's actually people who are very smart, who

00:35:05.470 --> 00:35:08.930
tend to play with language, and that's how
they evolve things.

00:35:08.930 --> 00:35:13.180
So, yeah. Go ahead.

00:35:13.180 --> 00:35:16.010
Q [inaudible]

00:35:16.010 --> 00:35:22.960
Ben Huh: That's a very good question.
Do we have plans to expand internationally?

00:35:22.960 --> 00:35:25.340
There were some people who were trying to
translate lolcats to Spanish.

00:35:25.340 --> 00:35:29.290
And I don't know if that worked, because it
tends to be cultural.

00:35:29.290 --> 00:35:33.200
Because we focus things at small cultures
within a large group.

00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:37.980
It tends to be very -- it's not just a translation
that works.

00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:41.880
It has to match that culture.
Lol cats are somewhat known in Japan, but

00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:45.340
they're not wildly popular in a culture where
they love cats, right?

00:35:45.340 --> 00:35:46.861
There's something interesting about that phenomenon.
Why isn't it as popular?

00:35:46.861 --> 00:35:49.490
They actually have a relatively good grasp
of English.

00:35:49.490 --> 00:35:55.580
They're taught in school. Why not?
It's just something that I haven't been able

00:35:55.580 --> 00:35:57.480
to figure out yet.
Yeah.

00:35:57.480 --> 00:36:00.160
Q So, I'm interested in your perspective on
search.

00:36:00.160 --> 00:36:06.480
How does one exactly search for a cute picture
with misspellings that might not be linked

00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:07.580
off anywhere on the Internet?

00:36:07.580 --> 00:36:11.420
A Yeah, so, that's a very good question.
I think it's very relevant here.

00:36:11.420 --> 00:36:18.680
We tend to give it a specific type of nomenclature,
or we tend to take a phrase that is used regularly

00:36:18.680 --> 00:36:22.020
in our culture.
So for example, "There I Fixed It."

00:36:22.020 --> 00:36:25.570
What would you search for?
Pictures of horrible fix-up jobs?

00:36:25.570 --> 00:36:28.050
I mean, that's really long.
I mean, that's like not something that people

00:36:28.050 --> 00:36:30.600
think about.
But if you give it a name like "There I Fixed

00:36:30.600 --> 00:36:34.240
It," which is a phrase that we would be familiar
with in everyday life, right?

00:36:34.240 --> 00:36:37.430
Or "It Made My Day," right?
That's how people search.

00:36:37.430 --> 00:36:41.120
They look for the name of the blog.
And I was talking to Matt Cutts about this

00:36:41.120 --> 00:36:45.950
 -- your chief spam cop guy.
And one of the things I think he found fascinating

00:36:45.950 --> 00:36:51.170
was that, we don't really care about SCO.
Like, we own the term 'lolcat'.

00:36:51.170 --> 00:36:58.350
We own the term 'cheeseburger' actually. [laughter]
Cheeseburger ranks number two for the search

00:36:58.350 --> 00:37:01.270
for the word 'funny.'
FAIL blog ranks number three for the word

00:37:01.270 --> 00:37:05.230
funny, right?
We don't do SCO, because organically, we have

00:37:05.230 --> 00:37:09.930
no idea what people are going to call us.
So we just try to rank for the term that is

00:37:09.930 --> 00:37:13.590
the name of the site, which is actually relatively
easy to do -- thank you, Google.

00:37:13.590 --> 00:37:17.950
Like, before you guys were around, I Can Has
Cheezburger would never have taken off, right?

00:37:17.950 --> 00:37:25.210
Before search was actually this effective,
no one was going to search for "I can what?"

00:37:25.210 --> 00:37:30.030
No one knew our name, yet people found us.
And that's through the power of search.

00:37:30.030 --> 00:37:34.040
Like, if you type in anything remotely close
to I Can Has Cheezburger, like remotely close

00:37:34.040 --> 00:37:39.700
 -- "we has a cheeseburger" -- you end up
on I Can Has Cheezburger. [laughter]

00:37:39.700 --> 00:37:44.240
So, thank you. Long-winded way of saying,
"Thank you for that."

00:37:44.240 --> 00:37:48.730
So by the way, we have books for Graph Jam,
FAIL blog, and I Can Has Cheezburger, if you

00:37:48.730 --> 00:37:52.190
want to buy them.
There's also Happy Cats -- the cat that spawned

00:37:52.190 --> 00:37:54.530
it all -- with a little stuffed animal version
of that cat.

00:37:54.530 --> 00:37:59.130
So, MJ's here to take your order if you'd
like them.

00:37:59.130 --> 00:38:03.190
But yeah, that's pretty much all I have to
say.

00:38:03.190 --> 00:38:04.359
&gt;&gt; Great. Thank you very much.

00:38:04.359 --> 00:38:05.000
&gt;&gt; [Clapping]
