00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:04.220
*Intro Music*

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:07.780
So, fearing this story is sounding one hundred percent like coke ravings,

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:10.640
Korean Britney Spears brings back the dramatic tone.

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:15.020
Just try to listen to this with any hint of seriousness.

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:17.800
"A thousand Narfs is about a rare Narf."

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:20.320
"Who comes once in a generation of a Narfs."

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.060
*Hysterical Laughter*
"Who is called the Madam Narf."

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:23.140
"Who is called the Madam Narf."

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.720
"A Scrunt will do anything to
kill a Madam Narf!"

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:29.120
"Even forget his fears of the Tartutic."

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:31.840
*More Hysterical Laughter*
"And it is the Madam Narf herself."

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.200
"Does she know that she is a Madam Narf?"

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:35.040
Okay...

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.500
I'm sure Shyamalan is hearing this
really intense dramatic story,

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.420
But to the rest of the world all we can hear is...

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:43.380
A thousand (Narf)s

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:44.200
Rare (Narf)

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:45.660
The madam (Narf)

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.160
kill a madam (Narf)

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.160
The madam (Narf) herself

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.220
She know that she is a madam (Narf)?

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.090
once in a generation of a (Narf)s

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:56.470
I would give anything if the twist to this movie was that

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:00.400
The entire time, it was Pinky and the Brain trying to take over the world.

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:04.660
Literally, every single problem
would be fixed if they just do that twist.

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:06.720
It's a Warner Brothers' movie, make
it happen!

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:08.100
Speaking of which-

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.900
The master writer himself is told that his writing is going to change the world.

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:18.040
And give inspiration, I shit you not here, to the future president.

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.860
"This boy, will become leader of this country."

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:24.600
"And begin a movement of great change."

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:27.260
But also, yeah, gets even better,

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:33.270
His ideas will be so dangerous that someone will eventually take his life because of them.

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.440
And yet he still chooses to write the story.

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:41.759
Sacrificing himself not only for his art
but for the world.

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:44.620
Wow!

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:49.020
Is it... windy on that egotistical high
horse that you built for yourself?

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:54.200
I mean, Christ, you can see his boner
growing with every praising word.

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.380
"He will speak of you and your words."

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:57.860
*Stretching Sounds*

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.040
"Your book will be the seeds of many of his great thoughts."

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:02.360
*More Stretching Sounds*

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.680
"It will be the seeds of change."

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:05.640
*Even More Stretching Sounds*

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:06.220
*Explosion Sound*

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.200
Ohh! Now that's a messy story.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.380
So Giamatti is told that Rofio's mother will only tell the rest of the story if she can see him like a child.

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.480
"You have to make her see you as a child. Innocent."

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.940
So, ahhh... I can't even... just watch.

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:28.040
*Grunt*

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:31.600
*Throaty Sigh*

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.740
"Tell her it's a beautiful story."

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.040
*Foreign Language*

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.510
"Are there... are there any parts that might be good to hear?"

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.560
*More Foreign Language*

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.260
*Soft Laughter*

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:43.820
Okay...

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:48.480
So... let's say this represents the
world of sanity.

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.720
And this represents the edge of sanity.

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.200
And this represents the world of insanity.

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.600
You would be on Mars, you are so friggin' gone.

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:06.280
Because we have no idea where the hell you are to come up with a scene this goddamn bonkers!

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.500
I mean, what the hell is going on?

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:12.760
Is this what you do with all your Oscar nominated actors?

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.300
Make them look like they're jerking off sideways while peeing like a dog?

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:22.080
That's not acting like a child. That's acting like three lobotomies were given to you, in maple syrup!

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:25.520
What are you?!

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:30.560
So the (Narf) can't say anything about her world for...

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.940
Reasons...

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:35.580
But it's okay because she touches her ear to answer yes or no questions.

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:39.100
As that doesn't count for... reasons.

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:44.440
So there's a Symbolist, a Guardian, a
Healer, and a Guild he's supposed to find in order to help her.

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:48.800
And before you say anything, yes, this
"simple bedtime story"

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:52.460
Is as goddamn complicated as a freaking D&amp;D game!

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:55.710
"Do you know who the Symbolist or
Interpreter is?"

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:57.690
I don't know. let's roll the dice to find out!

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:58.630
*Dice rolling on table sounds*

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:03.740
So he goes to the crossword guy and his increasingly strange son.

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:07.080
"This picture on a cereal box is supposed to make you feel happy."

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:11.560
"I feel sad like that time you forgot to pick me up at school."

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:15.760
Are we in Wonderland?

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:22.200
He finds the others as well and takes them to a naked cut up lady he's keeping in his shower

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:24.800
This raises no concerns.

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:26.800
"Interpreter will tell us what to do."

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:30.890
"Nine letters across... is the word essential."

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:32.510
"I *Stutter* I thought that was weird."

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:33.100
*Emmm*

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:36.160
Really? THAT'S weird?

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:41.360
You're using a crossword puzzle to predict the future in front of a naked woman

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:43.300
Who's been kidnapped by the sideways guy

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:45.340
And THAT'S friggin' weird?!

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:46.380
Which I said...

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:53.020
The funny thing is, even by bedtime story standards, there's practically no action in any of this.

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:58.080
I mean, did Shyamalan actually read this to his kids every night?

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:01.660
And then they sat around the shower for a bit doing crosswords,

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:05.740
As Mr. Heep toured the apartments for a fifth time to talk to even more people.

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:08.040
Daddy, can you read us "Snow White"?

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:13.380
Kids, that story doesn't have nearly enough references to another story to make it interesting.

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:15.890
This is a bedtime story for a new
generation.

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:18.330
But its boring, we can barely stay awake.

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:19.360
That means it's working.

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:24.660
So he apparently can see the Scrunt by walking backwards and looking in the mirror.

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:28.980
Why? Because it's less complicated than doing jumping jacks and looking through a fruit loop.

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:30.720
Just get used to nothing being explained.

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:32.940
The Scrunt scares him away,

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:36.820
but to be fair you were asking Paul Giamatti to protect you,

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:38.340
What you think was going to happen?

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:40.990
In fact you saved him the first time,

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:43.490
You really thought this was the guy was gonna be on top of things?

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:46.600
There is no originality left in the world, Mr. Heep.

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:48.780
So they work on a new strategy.

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:51.830
"The Scrunt will hide unless he can't hide in his environment."

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.720
Doesn't that go without saying?

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:57.520
He'll hide unless he can't hide?

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:02.980
So they decide to throw a party to distract the Scrunt,

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.200
Yeah, always good to
throw other people's lives in there,

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:07.620
As we're realizing getting closer and closer to the end

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:10.900
That this really shouldn't have been called "Lady in the Water".

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:12.940
She barely does a friggin' thing!

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:14.600
What they should have called it is "Whispering",

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:16.240
Because that's all anybody does!

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:24.380
*Whispering*

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:27.280
"Turn it up! Turn it up!"
*Continued whispering*

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.880
So they wait for the eagle to come and get her as apparently nobody in the party would notice THAT,

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:36.820
But hey, if they don't notice a grass dog attacking a woman and dragging her into the woods,

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:38.840
I guess they wouldn't notice that either.

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:41.340
Oh! By the way, a grass dog attacks her and drags her into the woods.

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:42.700
*Bark*

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:45.680
Oh no! This is terrible! What should we do?

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:47.540
More crosswords!

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:50.660
"No... no... I don't know."

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:55.420
But big shock! They start
to ask "What if this is all a little crazy?"

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:59.540
"Why are you so certain that I'm the
Interpreter and they are the Guild?"

00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:01.560
"I asked someone."

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:06.420
"What kind of person would be so arrogant to presume to know the intention of another human being

00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:08.540
Who has put this young girl's life in jeopardy?"

00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:15.570
What heartless demon who gives points of view on art has doomed mankind for all eternity?

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:18.760
*Gasp*
The critic!

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:22.860
*Booing sounds*

00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:27.600
If only he praised Shyamalan, I mean any random writers of their genius!

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:33.620
But no! He had to point out the faults of movies like Signs, I mean any random story!

00:07:33.629 --> 00:07:38.429
This is all so obviously about Shyamalan, I mean Shyamalan, I mean Shyamalan, I mean you!

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:41.120
If you were Shyamalan.

00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:45.620
Look at this.
He writes the critics so one-dimensionaly

00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:49.520
That he actually confuses real life for a movie.

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:55.440
"Precisely the moment where the mutation or beast will attempt to kill an unlikable side character."

00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:59.320
"In stories where there has been no prior cursing, nudity, killing,

00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:02.420
The unlikable character will narrowly escaped,

00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:06.240
And may even be given a humorous moments to allow the audience to feel good about."

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:07.360
*Bark*

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:08.800
*Laughing*
I'm sorry...

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:10.320
*Gasp*
This... this is really hard.

00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:13.360
*Laughing*
It's really hard for me to get through this.

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:14.400
*Gasping*

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:17.460
*Stutters*... Cause that's all
they are. That's all critics are.

00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:22.060
It's literally just... "My life is a movie,
everything is connected to movie,

00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:25.080
I am robot, I judge and hate everything!"

00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:27.700
"There is no personal vendetta going on at all."

00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:32.580
"It is about you, the personal artists at home it is not about one individual person."

00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:35.520
"Who... probably is in this film somewhere."

00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:38.459
"I mean, I can't see him at all it's just too subtle,

00:08:38.460 --> 00:08:40.660
But maybe he's in the movie!"

00:08:40.660 --> 00:08:45.080
*laughing*
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, this is so unprofessional and I should just stay serious,

00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:47.000
That won't happen again I like just get out a little bit more-

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:48.080
*more laughing*

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:50.000
OK, OK, won't happen again, I promise.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:50.860
*Grunt*

00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:59.240
So... After that "stellar" satire criticism,
really SNL-worthy,

00:08:59.620 --> 00:09:03.940
They start to wonder if anyone else
could possibly be the Interpreter.

00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:07.740
"The hands of the Guild will be needed plus two others."

00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:10.500
"It is a ceremony of seven sisters."

00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:12.860
"Sisters? The guild is women?"

00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:15.800
"You'll need a man who has no secrets."

00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:19.540
*Spasm Sounds*
"And one whose opinions are highly respected as witnesses."

00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:24.060
"Touch together with their hearts as one to bring strength to the moment."

00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:28.380
"You'll need a man who has no secrets."

00:09:28.660 --> 00:09:31.980
"And one whose opinions are highly respected as witnesses."

00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:46.580
*Insane Laughter*

00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:49.480
*Insane Laughter*
Oh! My god!

00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:51.480
*Insane Laughter*

00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:52.940
*Gasping*

00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:54.380
People at home,

00:09:54.380 --> 00:09:57.410
You are not stoned, you are not high,

00:09:57.410 --> 00:09:59.340
You are seeing this correctly!

00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:08.380
A little boy, with incredible detail, is predicting the future of an ancient civilization...

00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:11.660
By staring at cereal boxes!

00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:13.360
Cereal boxes!

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:17.980
*Laughing*
Oh my God, I am crying, I am actually crying, this is so funny!

00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:19.400
*Gasping*

00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:21.500
What is he going to see?

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:29.160
The cookie Crook'll go cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs when Captain Crunch's neck go Snap Crackle and Pop,
and it'll be "grrrrreat"?

00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:32.860
What? Were the fortune cookies too hard to understand?

00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:34.520
*Laughing*

00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:37.760
I can't breathe!

00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:42.320
"Almost three, this will all be over in moments."

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:46.840
Now, onto the spice rack, where I will predict the second coming of Jesus!

00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:48.140
*Gasping*

00:10:48.140 --> 00:10:50.100
*Laughing*
Oh my god!

00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:51.420
Oh!

00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:52.520
I just came a bit.

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:59.700
"I read it wrong, I thought it said she'll lead a ceremony of Seven Sisters to bring strength to the moment."

00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:03.160
But it really just said "Cinnamon Toast Crunch".

00:11:04.180 --> 00:11:07.760
It turns out Giamatti has to be the healer because... Well,

00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:11.460
Symbolically, it ties to his family
and that dead horse is so kicked

00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:13.840
You can see the Nike symbol indented into it.

00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:19.060
It, of course, brings her back to life as the big Shyamalan twist is finally revealed.

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:20.460
Oh my God!

00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:23.000
Reggie! Reggie, just keep looking in his eyes

00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:25.380
*Thunder Strike*

00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:28.440
Oh my god! It takes place at the Cove

00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:32.140
Wait! I already knew that. Why'd you
cut to that?

00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:33.300
What the hell's the twist?

00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:34.480
He's the Guardian

00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:37.840
Reggie's the Guardian. Wow! I didn't know Cliffnotes could serve as twists now

00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:40.840
I mean uh, ohhh you really got me, ahhh!

00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:43.080
To look at the movie a whole different way now...

00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:46.960
And then apparently these things come out.

00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:48.140
*Wild Hauling*

00:11:48.140 --> 00:11:51.280
I am Groot.
Your ass is grass.

00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:53.860
*Eagle Sound*

00:11:53.970 --> 00:11:57.070
The Eagles are coming! The Eagles are coming!

00:11:57.360 --> 00:12:00.400
*Pleasant Music*

00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:02.400
And, no kidding,

00:12:02.610 --> 00:12:03.810
That's the ending.

00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:07.440
Yeah, the Eagle picks
her up and it just stops.

00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:10.220
Even Giamatti has a look on his face like:

00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:12.560
"That's it?
Are you kidding me?"

00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:17.080
"My two minute cameo in Downton Abbey was worth more of my time than this!"

00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:21.500
People, I know "The Happening" is fun... But...

00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:25.800
Where else can you see a Narf outrunning a Scrunt,

00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:29.820
With Paul Giamatti waving his leg and touching himself in front of two women,

00:12:29.820 --> 00:12:32.520
Helped by a guy who can predict the future through crosswords,

00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:36.480
Who gave birth to a prophet who can read mythologies that are part of a complete breakfast,

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:40.000
With a critic who dares call this all insane portrayed as the bad guy,

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.780
With tree Hulks beating up grass stains with teeth,

00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:48.140
While a giant eagle picks up a whispering tart whose only job was to tell a person to write a book,

00:12:48.140 --> 00:12:52.600
And the twist centers around a guy
we saw only for two minutes in the opening.

00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:56.960
How can this not be a masterpiece of madness?

00:12:57.160 --> 00:13:01.140
Complete and total entertaining madness.

00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:07.040
So, to show my appreciation for this,
incredible experience

00:13:07.050 --> 00:13:11.970
I am finally going to give Shyamalan exactly what he wants.

00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:13.480
*Dramatic Music*

00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:15.300
*Dramatic Music*
You summoned?

00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:16.340
*Dramatic Music*

00:13:16.340 --> 00:13:17.400
Sit down Shyamalan.

00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:19.660
Alright.

00:13:20.380 --> 00:13:36.980
*Soft Music*

00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:41.260
Tell me about... Your genius method in making this film.

00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:43.060
Really?

00:13:43.060 --> 00:13:57.280
*Soft Music*

00:13:57.280 --> 00:14:02.260
Well, I was trying to get across how
creative artists are always kept down by cynicism.

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:05.680
Ah! So the woman's story actually
represent the artist's story.

00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:08.260
Yeah, I never knew if I made that clear
enough.

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:09.850
And am I correct in thinking that

00:14:09.850 --> 00:14:14.080
The character of the critic is a subtle
jab to people who don't understand your work?

00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:15.640
Exactly!

00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:17.720
You don't think that came off too strong, do you?

00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:18.760
Of course not.

00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:20.740
I thought it was downplayed actually.

00:14:20.740 --> 00:14:24.700
So, I wanted to get across that all the people in the world who criticize,

00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:26.680
They are the real death of dreams.

00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:29.460
And how did you come up with those incredible names?

00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:32.800
It sounds like it came from a language that's existed for years.

00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:34.240
That was my intention.

00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:37.640
You see, I'm a big fan of creating other worlds.

00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:39.500
And other worlds have different sounding names.

00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:40.340
So I said to myself:

00:14:40.620 --> 00:14:42.740
"What sounds weird and otherworldly?"

00:14:42.740 --> 00:14:43.440
A Narf!

00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:47.200
You just hear that word and immediately you think a beautiful woman.

00:14:50.300 --> 00:15:05.080
*Intro Music*

00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:06.960
(Narf)
