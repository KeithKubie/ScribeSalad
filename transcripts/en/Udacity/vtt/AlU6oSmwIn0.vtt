00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.650
So up to this point, we've created
our code almost purely from scratch,

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:06.939
using a few internal libraries
like HTTP Base Server and

00:00:06.939 --> 00:00:09.750
external libraries like SQL Alchemy.

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.540
Creating a website from scratch really
shows that you have a good grasp of

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.800
underlying programming concepts and
are able to utilize the power of Python.

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:17.990
But as we make our website more and

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:21.710
more complex, the code becomes
repetitive and difficult to maintain.

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.280
Frameworks are collections of code that
simplify the web development process.

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:27.070
They take care of repetitive tasks and

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:30.200
allow us to focus on the more
unique features of our project.

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.880
At the moment, some of

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.970
the most popular frameworks out there
are RubyonRails.net and Django.

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:37.970
But if we take a look at this Wikipedia
article, we see that there are hundreds

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:41.480
of frameworks developers have created to
code web applications more efficiently.

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:42.380
Frameworks may rise and

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:44.720
fall in popularity but
the same underlying concepts for

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:48.190
developing web pages applies for
all of these technologies.

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.070
Think of a framework as
a box of prepared cake mix.

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:53.570
We could make a cake using all
of these items from scratch and

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:56.540
would probably have a better
understanding of how to make cakes.

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:59.010
But if we have several cakes to
make in a short period of time,

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.920
finding a good cake mix simplifies
the preparation process and

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.640
helps us focus on other things.

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:04.190
Like frosting.

00:01:05.602 --> 00:01:09.310
In lesson two you built a website with
the raw ingredients of web development.

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:10.100
Now it's time to see how we

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.230
can use frameworks to improve
our development process.
