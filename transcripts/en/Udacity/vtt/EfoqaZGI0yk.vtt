00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
The next kind of testing is system testing, and here we're asking a different question 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
than we were asking with integration testing and unit testing.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Here we're asking the question does the system as a whole meet its goals?

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
And often at this point we're doing black box testing, and that's for a couple of reasons.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
First of all, the system is probably large enough by now

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
that a detailed knowledge of its internals may not be 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
very much help in creating good test cases.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
The second reason is really at this point we're not so much concerned

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
with what's going on inside the system as with 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
whether the system actually meets its goals or not,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
and so another thing that differentiates system testing from unit testing 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
is the fact that at this level we are often concerned with how the system will be used.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
And the fact is, at this level we may not care about 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
making the system work for all possible use cases.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Rather, we would simply like to make sure that it performs

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
acceptably for the important use cases.
