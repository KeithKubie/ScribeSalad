00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:05.300
Well, every Disneycember, we try to look at the best that Disney has to offer.

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:08.640
This year, we're... gonna go the opposite route.

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:13.820
If you're younger, you might have noticed all these sequels that seem to pop up to popular Disney films

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:16.200
that don't really seem to be as good.

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:21.440
This is because as hand-drawn films were starting to phase out and CG films were starting to phase in,

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:24.660
Disney didn't always have a lot to do for their hand-drawn department.

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:27.180
...At least, nothing that made that much of a profit.

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.360
However, that seemed to change -though not necessarily for the best...

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:33.600
...with the direct-to-DVD sequels.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.520
For whatever reason, kids just loved to see what was gonna happen next in these movies

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.560
that really didn't need any continuing stories.

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:45.460
And they got a reputation pretty fast of being the worst.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:51.420
You name it: Lion King, Aladdin, Pocahontas... even the Hunchback of Notre Dame got a sequel.

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.640
As they seemed to make more and more money, they pushed 'em out faster and faster, and...

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:56.380
Well...

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.920
...they have a reputation for being some of Disney's worst material in recent years.

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:06.180
For a long time people have been asking me to look these over, and by God, I didn't want to.

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:08.040
But you know what? I'm an optimist,

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.620
and I'm gonna hold out hope that there's at least one, just ONE, good sequel out there.

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:15.440
Is it a fool's wish? Maybe.

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:20.260
But I'm determined to get through all of them to see if they're as bad as everybody says they are.

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.940
...I get a feeling they're right, but I should judge for myself.

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:27.420
Even though there's... surprisingly enough films to almost fill the entire month,

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.760
there's still one or two that I haven't been able to get.

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.280
So I'll fill those in with... not sequels, but still direct-to-DVD movies that they made.

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.100
Is there somewhere a diamond in the rough to be found?

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.060
Well, all through the month of December, I'm gonna find out.

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:41.660
Because you demanded it:

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.480
this is Disneycember: Direct-to-DVD sequels!

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.020
...I hope you appreciate what I do for you.

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.100
[Disneycember theme]

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:56.520
...So let's go to where this all started:

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:01.980
I remember I got the VHS of 'Fox and The Hound', and as soon as you opened it up there was a little pamphlet that said

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.160
one of the greatest villains was coming back.

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:07.820
You open it up and you saw Disney's 'The Return of Jafar'.

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.400
Ho-ly smokes. To a little kid, this was amazing.

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:14.800
Aladdin was one of the biggest films that ever came out at that time,

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.800
and Disney never really did any sequels apart from 'The Rescuers Down Under'.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.440
So we were beyond excited to see another Aladdin movie on the big screen.

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:29.440
As more time went by though, we realized... it wasn't gonna be on the big screen, it was gonna be direct to VHS.

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.060
Well, okay. It was still an Aladdin sequel!

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:33.580
And it was done by Disney!

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:35.700
It still has to be pretty good, right?

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:38.940
Aaand then we saw the trailer for it, and...

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.600
...Man... there was a serious downgrade.

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.780
It was pretty obvious from the first frame what this was:

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.660
this was Disney trying to cash in on a popular movie.

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.800
Which they'd done before, but not usually with a sequel.

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:55.180
And not usually with SUCH a difference in animation!

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:00.060
So... yeah. The hype died down pretty quickly, but... it was still kid of interesting seeing it.

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:04.400
After all, it was Aladdin! And we wanted to know what evil scheme Jafar had up his sleeve.

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.500
The film centers around Aladdin getting used to his new palace life

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:10.380
...and apparently still unable to put on a shirt...

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:14.240
...when Iago the parrot escapes from Jafar's lamp and tosses it away.

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:19.920
Trying to convince Aladdin and the gang that he's changed for good, even though he really just wants a new position of power.

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.340
On top of that, the genie returns, too.

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:23.680
...Eeeeh, sort of.

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.720
Robin Williams didn't come back to voice him this time, and it really shows.

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:31.020
They got Dan Castellaneta, the voice of Homer Simpson, to do him instead,

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:34.280
and, to be fair, it's not a bad choice, he can do a pretty good impression.

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.640
But so much of the Genie WAS Robin Williams just doing his improv, and...

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:40.260
...nobody's as good as him!

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:42.180
...So immediately it's a little distracting.

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:46.160
But Jafar returns as well, as a thief, played by Jason Alexander,

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:52.540
accidentally releases him, and Jafar, as the genie, promises to grant him his wishes if he follows through with his revenge.

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:58.280
So Jafar plans his evil scheme by framing Aladdin, making it look like he killed the sultan.

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:00.660
All while locking up everybody else away (sic).

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:06.300
The plot in general is not... that bad, and to its credit Jafar's revenge is actually a pretty good one.

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:09.140
But nothing feels as fleshed out as the original.

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:13.900
In fact, Aladdin doesn't even seem like the focus. It feels more like the focus is on Iago.

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.720
He's the one that has the story arc. He's the one that's torn between two places.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.040
But in terms of what made the original Aladdin so enjoyable and continuing it here...

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:24.320
...a lot of it just doesn't transfer over.

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:27.360
Whether they didn't have the time, or the budget, or whatever...

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.220
...it just feels really rushed.

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:33.300
Aladdin and Jasmine don't have much chemistry, the Genie's not really that funny...

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:39.060
The animation, though I know they're trying, just can't compete with the incredible colors and movement that the first one had.

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:40.800
Even the songs aren't as hummable.

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:44.420
...And yeah. WAY too many of them are given to Gilbert Gottfried.

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:47.700
Because... THAT's a voice I wanna hear put to music!

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:53.660
I remember when my brother and I first saw it, we were more making fun of it than actually getting sucked into the story...

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:57.480
...but, again, being kids, we did put it on once or twice after.

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:02.560
We kind of accepted what it was: just a cheap knockoff, rushed out really fast, and...

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:07.220
...I guess as cheap knockoffs go, it's not the WORST, it's just not very good.

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:12.680
Its purpose is made totally complete by the ending, where it... just seems to end really abruptly.

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:15.460
They just say, "Hey! We wanna go see the world!",

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:17.440
and... it just kinda stops.

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:23.100
I remember we were scratching our heads what that was about, and then a few days later, the Aladdin cartoon show came out.

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:29.340
So... yeah. Really all this was, was a pilot episode for the Aladdin cartoon.

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:35.040
Honestly, I would have liked it more if it just came forward and said that's what this was,

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:40.080
if they'd just announced there was an Aladdin show coming out, and this was gonna be the first episode,

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:44.020
or a couple of episodes tied together like what they usually did with the Disney Afternoon.

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:51.400
But no. They had to put it on VHS, slap 'Return of Jafar' on it, and thus we now have to judge it as a Disney movie.

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:55.320
Not a theatrical release, but... still a sequel to a theatrical release.

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:57.480
And in that case... it's pretty bad.

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:04.480
What would have made a passable TV pilot is now the beginning of a long line of disappointing DVD sequels.

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:09.320
The only part that kiiind of gets a chuckle every once in a while is Jason Alexander as the thief.

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:13.220
But... that's because it's Jason Alexander and anything he touches is hilarious.

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:16.080
Well. Almost - Disney did manage to crush him once.

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:19.940
But even when he's saying unfunny lines, he can get a little bit of a laugh out of them.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.060
He's just that good.

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:24.600
As for the rest: I think the word to describe it is probably...

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:25.500
...awkward.

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:29.360
It's not godawful, it's not like there was no effort put into it, it's just...

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:30.540
...awkward.

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:35.400
Looking back years later, it's not that big a deal, especially when you know all the sequels that are gonna come out after...

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:41.400
But for a buncha kids that were excited to finally see a sequel to one of the biggest Disney films they've ever seen...

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:42.980
...it was pretty underwhelming.

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:46.400
I know it has a soft spot for some, I was just never one to get into it.

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:49.780
But this would only be the beginning of the Disney-sequel-suckfest,

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:53.340
more were on the way, and there was so much more suffering to be had.
