00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:04.770
Akshay brought four boxes of
chocolate truffles to a party.

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.180
Each box contains 6 truffles.

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:11.500
Every guest at the party
ate exactly 3 truffles,

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:13.660
and there were none left over.

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:15.770
How many guests
must there have been

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:18.590
at the party, must have
attended the party?

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:22.250
So we're trying to figure
out how many guests

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:24.120
must have attended the party.

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:28.750
So let's actually define a
letter to represent that.

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:34.780
So let's say that p, or
let's say g, g for guests,

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:41.590
let's say that g is equal to the
number of guests at the party.

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:44.050
Then we could actually
set up a relation

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:46.990
between the number of guests,
the number of truffles

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:50.130
each guest ate, and then the
total number of chocolates.

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:52.310
So what was the total
number of chocolates

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:54.300
that we have at this party?

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.770
Well, he bought 4 boxes.

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:59.410
And each box
contains 6 truffles.

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:02.080
So the total number of
chocolates at the party

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:05.540
must have been 4 times 6.

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.990
4 times 6 truffles
must have been

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.600
the total number of
truffles at the party.

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:13.730
So let me write this down.

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:17.835
This is the number
of truffles total.

00:01:21.532 --> 00:01:22.990
Now, what's another
way of thinking

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:25.970
about the total number
of truffles at the party?

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:28.430
Well, you have g guests.

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:30.630
So you have g guests.

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.212
And each guest ate 3 truffles.

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.640
So g times 3 is also going
to be the number of truffles

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.775
at the party-- number
of truffles total.

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.160
So these two things need
to be equal to each other.

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:53.880
So we could figure
out what 4 times 6 is.

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.510
And then we say, well, 4 times
6 is going to be some number.

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:00.430
And g times 3 has to
equal that same number.

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:01.780
What must g be?

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.170
So let's think about
that step by step.

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.770
So let's just
visualize 4 times 6.

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.570
So here is one box of truffles.

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:10.509
We get 6 truffles.

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:18.550
So it's 1 times 6, 2 times
6, 3 times 6, and 4 times 6.

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:21.700
Or another way of
thinking about 4 times 6,

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:26.670
that's the same thing
as 6 plus 6 plus 6

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:32.270
plus 6, which is 6, 12, 18, 24.

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:35.500
So what we have here on
the left hand side is 24.

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.894
So we get 24.

00:02:37.894 --> 00:02:39.310
And now we know
that this is going

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:42.260
to be equal to the number
of guests at the party.

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.060
This is going to be equal to the
number of guests at the party

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.390
times 3.

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.620
So what times 3 is equal to 24?

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:59.540
And another way of viewing this
is if g times 3 is equal to 24,

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:08.800
that means that 24 divided
by 3 must be equal to g.

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:14.440
So one way of thinking
about it, if I

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.520
were to divide these
truffles, these 24 truffles,

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:21.197
into groups of 3,
3 for each guest,

00:03:21.197 --> 00:03:23.030
well, the number of
groups I'm going to have

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:24.750
will tell me the number
of guests I have.

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.130
So let's do that.

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:29.010
So let's divide it
into groups of 3.

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:29.730
So let's see.

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:33.330
Here is one group of
3, right over here.

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:34.990
One group of 3.

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:38.680
And now I have another group
of 3, so two groups of 3.

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:42.045
And now I have
three groups of 3.

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:47.620
Here's four groups of 3.

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:55.630
Here is five groups of 3, six
groups of 3, seven groups of 3,

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:58.060
and eight groups of 3.

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:01.170
So if I were to take 24 things
and divide it into groups of 3,

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:02.810
I get 8 groups.

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:07.790
So we see that g-- let
me get my pen tool.

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:11.910
We see that g, or I
could say 24 divided by 3

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:16.782
is 8, which must be equal to the
number of guests at the party.

00:04:16.782 --> 00:04:18.740
The other way of thinking
about it is I'm like,

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:20.962
hey, some mystery
number here, g,

00:04:20.962 --> 00:04:22.670
that I'm trying to
figure out, the number

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:25.910
of guests at the party
times 3 is equal to 24.

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:28.330
So what times 3 is 24?

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:31.615
Well, you could just think about
all the multiples of three.

00:04:31.615 --> 00:04:33.110
3 times 1 is 3.

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:34.350
3 times 2 is 6.

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:41.620
3 times 3 is 9,
12, 15, 18, 21, 24.

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:45.916
That's three times 1,
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

00:04:45.916 --> 00:04:52.080
3 times 8 is 24, so
g must be equal to 8,

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.750
or 8 must be equal to g.

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:59.390
Or we had exactly 8
guests at our party.
