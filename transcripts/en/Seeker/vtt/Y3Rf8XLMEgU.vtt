00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:06.359
If I drink too much of this, am I going to
overdose?!

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:15.050
WHAT ABOUT THIS?

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:18.960
Overdosing is a terrible thing, and though
it's commonly associated with opiate drugs,

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.710
you can overdose on a bunch of seemingly harmless
other things.

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.460
Recently a case study published in Pediatric
Neurology described a boy in Italy with seizures,

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:28.650
headaches, and high blood pressure.

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.100
After a week in the hospital, doctors noticed
the boy's teeth were black.

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.110
(It took them a week?

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:36.110
What?!)

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:41.110
Turns out, the kid has been eating 20 licorice
candies every day for the last four months.

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:45.510
SIDEBAR: we call it black licorice, everyone
else in the world just calls it licorice.

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.290
The red things WE eat don't contain licorice.

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:54.320
Licorice has been used as a medicine for over
4000 years and comes from the extract of the

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.750
licorice root, which contains glycyrrhizic
(glis-sigh-rizzic) acid.

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.360
The acid is 50 times sweeter than sugar and
is used to treat chronic hepatitis, inflammation,

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.180
ulcers, liver damage, and even viruses.

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:11.150
Eating too much caused the boy's body to freak,
so they stopped his "excessive consumption"

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:12.970
and he returned to normal.

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:15.290
HE OVERDOSED ON LICORICE.

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:17.970
The moral of this story, you can overdose
on a lot of things.

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:23.100
For instance, if you were hospitalized because
of irregular heartbeat, restlessness, vomiting,

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.689
muscle tremors, insomnia, anxiety and headaches
-- that would be pretty serious; right?

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.439
These are symptoms of a caffeine overdose!

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:35.350
You could even fall into a coma and die if
you consumed an excessive amount.

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:38.860
Caffeine is one of the most commonly abused
self-medications in the world.

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:43.590
"80% of the inhabitants of affluent countries
drink coffee or tea daily," and more than

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.300
600 to 900 milligrams of caffeine a day is
an overdose.

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:55.850
For measure, ONE tall (12 oz) Starbucks Blonde
Roast coffee contains 260 milligrams of caffeine.

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:56.850
Yikes.

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.939
But no one worries about that, instead we
worry about mercury contamination in fish!

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:06.149
A study in Biology Letters in 2010 found bluefin
and bigeye tuna contain more methylmercury

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:07.869
in their muscles than other species!

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:12.579
But while overdosing on methylmercury can
cause irreversible brain damage, to find out

00:02:12.579 --> 00:02:16.529
how much that would be depends on the fish
and where it came from, how much you ate,

00:02:16.529 --> 00:02:18.870
your body mass and how frequently you eat
it.

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:24.200
Thatâ€™s why the FDA recommends no more than
6 ounces, or one tuna steak meal a week.

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:29.650
Tomatoes and potatoes can cause solanine poisoning,
but you'd have to eat SO MANY of them to "overdose"

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:35.409
on potatoes -- 67 potatoes in a single sitting,
as calculated by one website.

00:02:35.409 --> 00:02:39.519
Not to mention, the human body can only process
2,000 milligrams per day of ascorbic acid

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:45.019
or "Vitamin C." Carrots, oranges, strawberries
and peppers all contain it; and if you overate

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:50.359
these foods while taking supplements too,
you COULD conceivably end up consuming more

00:02:50.359 --> 00:02:52.049
than your body could clean.

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:55.579
That would cause vomiting, heartburn, headache,
kidney stones and digestive problems like

00:02:55.579 --> 00:02:57.189
diarrhea and cramps.

00:02:57.189 --> 00:03:04.319
Over 11-thousand milligrams can kill, but
that's a LOT.

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:05.540
Even WATER can kill.

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:09.370
Too much water dilutes the electrolytes in
the body, throwing the water and sodium balance

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:12.629
off -- and causing death by water intoxication.

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:18.659
While relatively uncommon, it does happen,
usually as part of mental illness, or miseducation

00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:20.540
in lifestyle choices.

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:25.340
One 2005 New England Journal of Medicine study
found 13 percent of Boston MArathon runners

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:30.699
had extremely low sodium in their blood, and
in 2007 a woman died during a radio station

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:39.989
contest from water intoxication.

00:03:39.989 --> 00:04:03.930
I've said 
it before, and I'll say it again.

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:09.390
Everything in moderation!
