00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:02.380
MALE SPEAKER: All right.

00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:03.800
Thank you for coming, everyone.

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:06.181
We have a special
guest today on the day

00:00:06.181 --> 00:00:07.430
that his new book is released.

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:10.940
So this is a real
treat for us at Google.

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:13.170
Alva Noe is a writer
and philosopher,

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.040
specializing in human experience
and the philosophy of mind.

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:19.210
He holds degrees from
Columbia, Oxford, and Harvard,

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:21.900
where he earned his PhD.

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.690
He's now a member of
philosophy faculty

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:26.460
at the University of
California, Berkeley,

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.990
as well as Berkeley's Institute
for Cognitive and Brain

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:31.860
Sciences and the
Center for New Media.

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:33.960
Outside of academia,
you can find his writing

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.410
on NPR's "13.7, Cosmos
and Culture," where

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.230
he's written about
topics from PTSD

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:42.500
to Wilmer Flores and
the New York Mets.

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.015
He's the author of four
books, "Action in Perception,"

00:00:45.015 --> 00:00:48.290
"Out of Our Heads," "Varieties
of Presence," and his latest

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:50.650
work, which is the
aforementioned book released

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:53.380
today, "Strange Tools."

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:55.620
In this subtle and
enthusiastic new book,

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.050
he draws on examples from
keeping score at a baseball

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.310
game, to Nirvana, to
avant-garde art exhibitions

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:05.260
to lay out a new way of
understanding art-- one that

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.250
avoids the reductionist approach
of neuroscience and reframes

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.280
art as a crucial
practice of human life.

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.077
For more in that
topic and to celebrate

00:01:13.077 --> 00:01:14.660
the release of
"Strange Tools," please

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:17.020
give a warm welcome to
our guest, Alva Noe.

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:21.550
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.060
ALVA NOE: Thank you very
much for that warm welcome.

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:32.550
And yes, it's a very
exciting day for me.

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:35.130
I've been working on this
book for a long time.

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.420
And I've given dozens of
talks about different aspects

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:39.925
of the book that feed into it.

00:01:39.925 --> 00:01:41.550
But I'm never given
a talk on the book,

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:44.540
where the books sort of exists
already independently of me.

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.160
And it's an
interesting challenge

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.400
to think about,
now, what to pull

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:55.020
from it to share with you as
sort of an invitation to it.

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.080
The book is called
"Strange Tools."

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:00.270
It's about art and human nature.

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.060
The questions that guide the
book from start to finish

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:10.320
are, what is art, why does
art matter to us as much as it

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:15.250
does, what does art tell us
or what can it tell us about

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.600
ourselves.

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.590
And I thought I would
begin by reading

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:27.120
two pages from Chapter
9, which is called,

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.842
"Why Is Art So Boring?"

00:02:29.842 --> 00:02:30.760
Did I hear a chuckle?

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.700
"Do you remember
being bored as a kid?

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:41.890
I recall summer days
during vacation that seem,

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:45.670
as I think back on them now,
to have been fantastically,

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:53.570
impossibly long, hot, endless,
open, without organization,

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:57.630
irritating, the buzz
of flies, fighting

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:04.410
with my little brother,
nothing to do, parents remote."

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:08.160
"By and large, there's
no place for this sort

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:15.820
of radical boredom in the life
of an adult. As you get older,

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:20.810
life gets organized around
projects, and plans, and needs,

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:22.860
and goals.

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:27.050
And the result of this
congealing of activity

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:29.500
is that time speeds up.

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:33.320
Or we simply stop paying
attention to the metronome

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:36.220
and are captured
by larger patterns

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:39.410
of meaning and organization."

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:41.550
"Our days are over,
one might almost

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:44.770
say, before they have
begun, for we've already

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:48.240
defined the present
moment in relation

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:53.990
to what is yet to happen, in
relation to the purpose, point,

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:55.097
or plan.

00:03:55.097 --> 00:03:56.180
What did you do yesterday?

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:57.180
Oh, I went to work.

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:01.860
And this is all for the good.

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:03.330
It's a necessity."

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:05.310
"We achieve this.

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:09.690
We do not live in the tick-tock
motion of sensations and buzzes

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:12.290
and one thing after another.

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:14.010
It's the mark of
our development,

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:19.240
of our integration, to
use John Dewey's phrase.

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:24.720
Our lives are not made up
of a series of sensations.

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:28.400
They're composed of
experiences, experiences

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:34.120
that demand to be named,
that dinner in Venice,

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:38.840
going shopping, the softball
game last weekend, my visit

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:41.330
here to Google."

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:46.260
And these experiences
integrate over time."

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.510
"Grown-ups don't get bored.

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:52.670
Grown-ups can't get bored.

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:55.700
For that distinct,
emotional state,

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:57.740
vaguely painful,
that sense of being

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:01.970
trapped in the unending
and meaningless,

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:07.810
that state is available only in
the absence of structure, plan,

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:11.360
task, obligation.

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:17.140
The preconditions for boredom
are absent in adult life."

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:19.190
"Now, what does this
have to do with art?

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:22.390
My conjecture is everything.

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:27.890
The closest I have come
as an adult to reliving

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:30.850
the florid, boredom
of childhood is when

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:34.210
in the presence of art."

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:36.640
That's another
chuckle opportunity.

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:38.580
"Don't get me wrong, I love art.

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:39.250
I work with art.

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:39.900
I study art.

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:42.680
I was raised in a
family of artists.

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:44.560
Art matters to me.

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:46.930
And yet, it's hard for
me to think of anything

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:51.840
more slit-your-wrists dull
than some performances

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:55.640
or more excruciatingly
sleep-inducing

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:58.860
than encountering,
again, a gallery space

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:00.700
with pictures on the
wall, each of which,

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:04.780
to begin with at
least, is closed, mute,

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:08.010
indistinguishable,
and off-putting."

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:13.210
"It isn't just bad art
that is liable in this way

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:16.670
to induce that feeling
of anxious capture

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:19.590
by an endless and
meaningless present.

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:22.440
I stood in galleries at The Met,
or The Frick, or other museums

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:27.590
that I love, and I found myself
totally cold in the presence

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:30.000
of work that I know and value.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.460
It's as if someone failed
to press the on button.

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:35.880
the work stays off or I do.

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:39.570
And this time spent with
art in the standby mode

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:42.780
can be a torture."

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:44.740
"I propose--" it's one
of the many proposals

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:49.160
that I make in this book--
"that the boringness of art

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:54.600
is a clue to what art is
and why it matters to us.

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:58.650
Any adequate account of
what art is and of its place

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:02.690
in our lives must
address the striking fact

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:04.760
that art has the
power to bore us.

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:06.690
This is a power
it maintains when

00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:11.750
everything else in our lives
mitigates against boredom."

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:15.460
"Art affords us the
opportunity to be

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:20.870
bored to tears when almost
nothing else in our life does.

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:24.980
And art's potential to be dull
does not contradict the fact

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:29.920
that art also moves, and
thrills, and transforms,

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:32.610
and excites us.

00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:36.150
Indeed, it's the opposite
side of the very same coin."

00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:39.180
"Just as there is no
encounter with love

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:42.690
without the live
risk of heartbreak,

00:07:42.690 --> 00:07:47.040
so there can be no
confrontation with art

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:50.750
that does not open up the
possibility of getting lulled,

00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:54.960
unconscious, and bored to death.

00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:57.240
Art is valuable only
in direct proportion

00:07:57.240 --> 00:08:02.540
to the degree to which
it can or might bore us.

00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:05.430
Why should this be?"

00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:06.810
That's Chapter 9.

00:08:06.810 --> 00:08:08.780
And by the time
I've gotten there,

00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:11.610
I've sort of set the stage
for what an answer to that

00:08:11.610 --> 00:08:12.870
would look like.

00:08:12.870 --> 00:08:16.160
But for now, I want to kind of
let that just hang out there

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:17.880
with us as a kind of prologue.

00:08:20.890 --> 00:08:23.622
When I was in graduate
school, I studied philosophy.

00:08:23.622 --> 00:08:25.330
But from the very
start, I was interested

00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:26.500
in cognitive science.

00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:31.590
And I was especially interested
in the study of vision.

00:08:31.590 --> 00:08:34.090
And one day, I found
myself in conversation

00:08:34.090 --> 00:08:36.900
with a man, an older
man, an artist,

00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:40.600
and he asked me to tell
him about vision science.

00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:42.409
What do you do in
vision science?

00:08:42.409 --> 00:08:46.420
And I said, well, the question
that we ask in vision science

00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:51.450
is, how is it that we manage
to experience this three

00:08:51.450 --> 00:08:55.560
dimensional world of solid
objects and surrounding space,

00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:59.300
when what we're given
in the retinal image

00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:03.610
are really distorted, upside
down, twitching, shifting,

00:09:03.610 --> 00:09:06.460
gappy pictures?

00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:10.030
How do we get from such
an impoverished stimulus

00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:11.170
to such a rich experience?

00:09:11.170 --> 00:09:15.690
How do we experience
so much visually

00:09:15.690 --> 00:09:16.990
on the basis of so little?

00:09:20.810 --> 00:09:28.570
And the artist, a man I
admired and knew very well,

00:09:28.570 --> 00:09:34.170
he sort of paused a beat, tried
to absorb what I just said,

00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:37.050
and then he just said, Nonsense!

00:09:37.050 --> 00:09:40.500
The question is not,
or should not be,

00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:44.505
how do we see so much on
the basis of so little.

00:09:44.505 --> 00:09:48.590
The interesting question is why
we see so little when there's

00:09:48.590 --> 00:09:50.635
so much around us to perceive.

00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:56.590
Well, I came away
from that conversation

00:09:56.590 --> 00:10:01.010
thinking he just didn't
understand the point.

00:10:01.010 --> 00:10:03.990
But years went by,
and I wrote the books

00:10:03.990 --> 00:10:06.410
that were mentioned
in the introduction--

00:10:06.410 --> 00:10:08.560
"Action in Perception,"
and "Out of Our Heads,"

00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:10.390
and "Varieties of Presence."

00:10:10.390 --> 00:10:13.430
And the basic idea
of those books--

00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:19.740
which I wrote from the context
of my own active collaboration

00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:23.740
with scientists; I wrote
those books very much with one

00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:27.360
foot outside of
academic philosophy--

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:29.020
the basic idea of
those books was

00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:33.130
that we shouldn't think of
perception, or consciousness,

00:10:33.130 --> 00:10:36.420
or experience as something
that happens inside us, not

00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:38.776
in the brain or anywhere else.

00:10:38.776 --> 00:10:40.150
We should think
of experience, we

00:10:40.150 --> 00:10:41.941
should think of
consciousness, as something

00:10:41.941 --> 00:10:45.080
that we enact or perform.

00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:47.000
And while it depends
on what's going on

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.410
inside us, and
particularly in our brains,

00:10:49.410 --> 00:10:53.370
it can't be reduced to what goes
on inside us or in our brains.

00:10:53.370 --> 00:10:55.710
Perception and
consciousness is--

00:10:55.710 --> 00:10:58.840
so I argued in these
books, convincingly

00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:04.350
or not as the case may be--
consciousness is an activity.

00:11:04.350 --> 00:11:07.270
It's a dynamic of involvement
with, an exchange with,

00:11:07.270 --> 00:11:09.050
the world around us.

00:11:09.050 --> 00:11:12.650
The body the world the brain
the environment other people

00:11:12.650 --> 00:11:16.050
make consciousness happen.

00:11:16.050 --> 00:11:18.670
Trying to find consciousness in
the brain-- which, of course,

00:11:18.670 --> 00:11:22.510
nobody's been able to do--
is looking for consciousness

00:11:22.510 --> 00:11:24.100
in the wrong place.

00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:26.040
It's like looking for
the value of the money

00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:29.670
in the paper it's printed
on, or like looking

00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:34.960
for the dance in
the dancer's body.

00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:38.600
It's just a confusion,
so I argued.

00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:41.770
And it dawned on
me at one point,

00:11:41.770 --> 00:11:43.830
as I remembered back
to that conversation

00:11:43.830 --> 00:11:49.920
I had had in graduate school,
that I had developed a view-- I

00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:52.610
called it the inactive
approach, sometimes

00:11:52.610 --> 00:11:55.180
the actionist approach,
sometimes the sensory motor

00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:59.600
approach to perception
consciousness-- that

00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:02.646
sort of vindicated what
that artist had said to me.

00:12:02.646 --> 00:12:04.020
There's really
two different ways

00:12:04.020 --> 00:12:05.060
of thinking about experience.

00:12:05.060 --> 00:12:06.601
You can think of
something we achieve

00:12:06.601 --> 00:12:08.169
and we can fail to achieve.

00:12:08.169 --> 00:12:10.710
Or you can think of experience
as something that sort of just

00:12:10.710 --> 00:12:13.720
happens, thanks to the way our
nervous system is triggered.

00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:15.950
And I was planking down
for this other view.

00:12:15.950 --> 00:12:18.920
So in some sense, I realized
looking back on this work

00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:21.680
that I'd done,
that I was arguing

00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:23.560
that the artist was right.

00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:27.420
And that was important to
me for a number of reasons.

00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:31.382
But one of them then dawned
on me only even more recently,

00:12:31.382 --> 00:12:32.840
which is that it
wasn't just that--

00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:34.710
and again, you don't have to
agree with me about this--

00:12:34.710 --> 00:12:36.543
but it wasn't just that
I'd come to conclude

00:12:36.543 --> 00:12:39.160
that, in some profound sense,
the artist had been right,

00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:40.950
but it was important
to me, I realized,

00:12:40.950 --> 00:12:43.840
that the artist was right.

00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:47.470
That is, I'd gotten this
lesson, I'd gotten this insight,

00:12:47.470 --> 00:12:49.990
from an artist and
from a perspective that

00:12:49.990 --> 00:12:54.600
had been afforded to him in
some way through his work

00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:58.180
through his in engagement
with, through his valuing art.

00:12:58.180 --> 00:13:01.020
Now, usually when philosophers,
or cognitive scientists,

00:13:01.020 --> 00:13:04.315
or psychologists try
to write about art,

00:13:04.315 --> 00:13:06.940
they think of it as a phenomenon
that they're going to explain.

00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:08.390
They're going to tell
you why it exists

00:13:08.390 --> 00:13:09.848
from an evolutionary
point of view.

00:13:09.848 --> 00:13:13.030
Or they're going to show you
how it works neurologically.

00:13:13.030 --> 00:13:16.232
But I came away then--
again, thinking back

00:13:16.232 --> 00:13:17.690
on this rich
experience that I had,

00:13:17.690 --> 00:13:20.180
this conversation--
thinking, no, we

00:13:20.180 --> 00:13:25.360
shouldn't think of art as a
phenomenon to be explained,

00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:30.300
but rather art as itself
a field of research

00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:33.240
or a domain of investigation,
a kind of inquiry

00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:35.740
in which explanations
are sought.

00:13:35.740 --> 00:13:39.380
We can think of art itself, the
work of dancers and painters,

00:13:39.380 --> 00:13:42.920
for example, as
forms of research.

00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:44.630
So one of the questions
I came to think

00:13:44.630 --> 00:13:47.860
hard about as I approached
writing this book is, well,

00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:49.210
what kind of research?

00:13:49.210 --> 00:13:50.480
What kind of research is this?

00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:53.924
And by the way, long before
I wrote "Strange Tools"--

00:13:53.924 --> 00:13:55.590
this sort of sounds
self-congratulatory,

00:13:55.590 --> 00:13:58.300
but it's really
part of my journey--

00:13:58.300 --> 00:13:59.825
long before I wrote
"Strange Tools,"

00:13:59.825 --> 00:14:02.450
long before I even really framed
for myself the idea of writing

00:14:02.450 --> 00:14:05.534
this book, artists were
responding positively to these

00:14:05.534 --> 00:14:07.950
other books that I'd written,
these books that were really

00:14:07.950 --> 00:14:10.980
written for people interested
in the mind and consciousness,

00:14:10.980 --> 00:14:13.760
really for cognitive
science broadly construed.

00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:17.070
And they were finding
some idea that I

00:14:17.070 --> 00:14:19.650
was helping them articulate
what it was that they

00:14:19.650 --> 00:14:21.580
were investigating in my work.

00:14:21.580 --> 00:14:23.092
Anyway, that's kind of an aside.

00:14:23.092 --> 00:14:25.050
I don't really know how
to finish that thought.

00:14:25.050 --> 00:14:31.420
But the point is I've come
to this point-- and in a way,

00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:34.560
this is perhaps
the most salient,

00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:44.480
most prominent thesis in
this book "Strange Tools"--

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:47.665
one of the main themes of
the book is the idea that art

00:14:47.665 --> 00:14:50.910
as a research
practice, specifically,

00:14:50.910 --> 00:14:54.850
it is a philosophical practice.

00:14:54.850 --> 00:14:58.070
I might just as well have said
that philosophy is an aesthetic

00:14:58.070 --> 00:15:00.457
or artistic practice.

00:15:00.457 --> 00:15:02.040
And one of the things
I do in the book

00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:04.770
is I try to explain that,
or unpack that, or give

00:15:04.770 --> 00:15:07.459
that meaning, especially
give that meaning

00:15:07.459 --> 00:15:09.125
when terms like
philosophy of themselves

00:15:09.125 --> 00:15:11.490
is difficult to define and
explain and maybe just as

00:15:11.490 --> 00:15:13.700
problematic as notions
like art itself.

00:15:16.410 --> 00:15:19.467
And the final position
that I arrive at,

00:15:19.467 --> 00:15:21.300
and which I explain in
the body of the book,

00:15:21.300 --> 00:15:25.200
and which I'll try to explain to
some degree with you right now

00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:29.950
is that, actually, the sort
of official view at the end

00:15:29.950 --> 00:15:33.370
is not that art and
philosophy are the same,

00:15:33.370 --> 00:15:36.160
but that each of them is a
species of a common genus.

00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:40.660
And that common genus I call
reorganizational practice.

00:15:40.660 --> 00:15:43.850
And just in a line, the
thing about reorganizational

00:15:43.850 --> 00:15:47.070
practices is that they
exhibit us to ourselves

00:15:47.070 --> 00:15:50.970
and, in doing so, invariably
give us the resources,

00:15:50.970 --> 00:15:53.030
whether we like it or
not, to change ourselves.

00:15:58.620 --> 00:16:02.160
Let me make a first pass at
some of those ideas-- a very

00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:03.420
informal first pass.

00:16:05.970 --> 00:16:08.640
I gave a talk at Google
a number of years ago,

00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:10.380
when "Out of Our
Heads" came out.

00:16:10.380 --> 00:16:12.310
And I gave a version
of this example

00:16:12.310 --> 00:16:15.220
then, too, because it's a rich
example that I come back to

00:16:15.220 --> 00:16:16.880
again and again.

00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:18.640
Imagine you're at a gallery.

00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:22.692
And there, you encounter
paintings, let's say.

00:16:22.692 --> 00:16:24.400
And imagine that
they're in a style which

00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:27.665
is completely strange to you.

00:16:27.665 --> 00:16:30.040
Maybe they're by a painter
you've never heard of or never

00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:31.510
seen, or they're
part of a movement

00:16:31.510 --> 00:16:33.760
that you're unfamiliar with.

00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:38.180
It's a very familiar,
very normal experience

00:16:38.180 --> 00:16:39.306
that you kind of walk in.

00:16:39.306 --> 00:16:40.430
Maybe you're with a friend.

00:16:40.430 --> 00:16:41.160
You're talking.

00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:43.630
The pictures don't
grab your attention.

00:16:43.630 --> 00:16:45.960
They all kind of look the same.

00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:49.630
They certainly
don't fascinate you.

00:16:49.630 --> 00:16:54.620
And left to your own devices,
you might very likely just

00:16:54.620 --> 00:16:56.812
continue on to the next
room looking for something

00:16:56.812 --> 00:16:57.770
more attention-getting.

00:17:00.494 --> 00:17:01.910
But I'm interested
in what happens

00:17:01.910 --> 00:17:05.000
when you don't do that--
when you don't keep on going,

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:10.030
when you don't
simply just pass by,

00:17:10.030 --> 00:17:14.619
but when you stop and take
another look and look again.

00:17:14.619 --> 00:17:16.190
Suppose that the
friend you're with

00:17:16.190 --> 00:17:18.310
is a huge fan of this artist.

00:17:18.310 --> 00:17:20.839
And she calls your attention
to features of the work

00:17:20.839 --> 00:17:24.579
that you hadn't noticed-- maybe
patterns in the composition

00:17:24.579 --> 00:17:26.430
or in the color
scheme or relationship

00:17:26.430 --> 00:17:27.746
between the different pictures.

00:17:27.746 --> 00:17:29.120
Or maybe she points
out something

00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:31.320
about the order in which
the pictures were made,

00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:33.403
or something about the
historical context in which

00:17:33.403 --> 00:17:36.060
they were made, or the kind
of work that was going on

00:17:36.060 --> 00:17:37.220
at the time they were
made and what this

00:17:37.220 --> 00:17:39.011
would have meant to
people who saw it then,

00:17:39.011 --> 00:17:40.310
whatever it might be.

00:17:40.310 --> 00:17:47.740
Sometimes, if you're lucky,
something remarkable happens.

00:17:47.740 --> 00:17:49.890
Whereas, all the
pieces basically

00:17:49.890 --> 00:17:54.030
look the same at
first, now they start

00:17:54.030 --> 00:17:58.720
to pop out at you
as individuals.

00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:05.680
And whereas before, they
seemed flat and uninteresting,

00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:10.080
now you start to, as it
were, see depth in them,

00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:13.950
or see into them, see structure,
see meaning, and indeed find

00:18:13.950 --> 00:18:15.134
them to be fascinating.

00:18:15.134 --> 00:18:17.300
Whereas, before they were
dull, now all of a sudden,

00:18:17.300 --> 00:18:19.960
they are attention-getting.

00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:23.700
So I'm very interested
in that transition.

00:18:23.700 --> 00:18:26.260
I mean, I think we have
all had that experience.

00:18:26.260 --> 00:18:28.006
If you've ever spent
any time with art,

00:18:28.006 --> 00:18:29.130
you've had that experience.

00:18:29.130 --> 00:18:30.713
Or with a record
album, I can remember

00:18:30.713 --> 00:18:32.865
the first time I listened
to Led Zeppelin's

00:18:32.865 --> 00:18:33.740
"Houses of the Holy."

00:18:33.740 --> 00:18:36.840
I couldn't understand what
people liked about it.

00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:40.240
Just one song sounded
like the next.

00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:41.380
I came to love the album.

00:18:41.380 --> 00:18:44.260
And I came to
perceive the structure

00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:48.500
and subtle differences
between the songs.

00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:51.930
So how do we understand
this transformation?

00:18:51.930 --> 00:18:53.900
It's a transformation,
which I think of as one

00:18:53.900 --> 00:18:57.610
from not seeing to seeing.

00:18:57.610 --> 00:19:00.600
Or as Nicole [? Pizzel, ?]
who's here in the audience,

00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:03.250
put it to me from seeing
to seeing differently.

00:19:06.950 --> 00:19:09.950
You might say, well,
it's a change in you.

00:19:09.950 --> 00:19:12.600
After all, the works
haven't changed.

00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:15.065
We're not talking about
kinetic art or digital art that

00:19:15.065 --> 00:19:16.190
might actually be changing.

00:19:16.190 --> 00:19:17.920
I'm just imagining
paintings in the wall.

00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:19.470
So the paintings
haven't changed.

00:19:19.470 --> 00:19:22.400
If there's a change,
there's a change in you.

00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:24.530
But I think it's important
to realize that it's not

00:19:24.530 --> 00:19:26.740
merely a change in what
you think or believe,

00:19:26.740 --> 00:19:30.240
because whatever the
change is, I would argue.

00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:32.860
It's a change that enables you
to see what was there all along

00:19:32.860 --> 00:19:35.210
but they couldn't see before.

00:19:35.210 --> 00:19:38.640
It's a change that enables you
to bring with what is there

00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:41.730
into focus, to
bring it into focus

00:19:41.730 --> 00:19:42.980
for your conscious experience.

00:19:46.490 --> 00:19:50.504
Now, one way I
could summarize what

00:19:50.504 --> 00:19:52.420
I'm trying to do in this
book is to understand

00:19:52.420 --> 00:19:54.680
that transformation.

00:19:54.680 --> 00:19:57.100
I call it reorganization.

00:19:57.100 --> 00:19:59.654
How is it that in that
situation through active

00:19:59.654 --> 00:20:01.445
looking, through
thinking, through talking,

00:20:01.445 --> 00:20:04.590
and through interrogating the
things before you that we come

00:20:04.590 --> 00:20:07.690
to experience them differently?

00:20:07.690 --> 00:20:12.420
How is it that we reorganize
ourselves in that way?

00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:17.590
Notice that what I
described as such,

00:20:17.590 --> 00:20:20.350
doesn't really have anything
special to do with art.

00:20:20.350 --> 00:20:24.220
It's a general feature
of our perceptual lives

00:20:24.220 --> 00:20:26.940
that through learning
and knowledge and talking

00:20:26.940 --> 00:20:29.250
and interaction
we achieve access

00:20:29.250 --> 00:20:32.314
to what there is around us
in our perceptual lives.

00:20:32.314 --> 00:20:33.730
Think of how you
learn a language,

00:20:33.730 --> 00:20:35.312
and then you can read.

00:20:35.312 --> 00:20:37.270
You couldn't be offended
by the racist graffiti

00:20:37.270 --> 00:20:38.660
if you couldn't read
the language it was in.

00:20:38.660 --> 00:20:41.470
Suddenly, you can read it, and
boom, you can be hit by it.

00:20:41.470 --> 00:20:45.150
So we can bring the world
into focus through learning.

00:20:45.150 --> 00:20:47.447
And it happened really quickly.

00:20:47.447 --> 00:20:49.030
So in some sense,
this gallery example

00:20:49.030 --> 00:20:52.350
I've given you isn't an
art-specific example.

00:20:52.350 --> 00:20:53.960
But there is something
about it which

00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:59.710
I think is maybe a clue to what
makes art special or at least

00:20:59.710 --> 00:21:02.050
one of art's special gifts.

00:21:02.050 --> 00:21:06.820
And that is that a visit
to the gallery of this kind

00:21:06.820 --> 00:21:13.220
is one in which you get the
opportunity to catch yourself

00:21:13.220 --> 00:21:15.980
in the act of doing just that.

00:21:15.980 --> 00:21:18.290
It's not just that you
undergo a transformation,

00:21:18.290 --> 00:21:22.390
but you realize that you're
undergoing the transformation

00:21:22.390 --> 00:21:24.450
and it's made available to you.

00:21:24.450 --> 00:21:29.520
Now for me, that is a
paradigmatically philosophical

00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:34.840
kind of moment, where you in
a way stop business as usual

00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:36.777
but get to reflect
on what you're doing.

00:21:36.777 --> 00:21:38.360
It's one of the
things that philosophy

00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:41.970
aims at-- that kind of
self-disclosure or unveiling

00:21:41.970 --> 00:21:44.160
of oneself to oneself.

00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:47.110
And moreover, in
this example, it

00:21:47.110 --> 00:21:51.410
does it in the setting of
the exercise of our abilities

00:21:51.410 --> 00:21:53.850
to look and think
and see, that is,

00:21:53.850 --> 00:21:55.850
in the setting of
our real lives,

00:21:55.850 --> 00:21:57.830
in the setting up
our lived experience.

00:21:57.830 --> 00:22:00.130
So the ways in
which we reorganize

00:22:00.130 --> 00:22:01.980
and the ways in which
we transform ourselves

00:22:01.980 --> 00:22:04.615
have to do with perception
and consciousness.

00:22:04.615 --> 00:22:05.990
So if this is
right, then there's

00:22:05.990 --> 00:22:09.680
a sense in which what this
encounter with art is affording

00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:16.732
us is not just an
episode in consciousness

00:22:16.732 --> 00:22:19.315
but a kind of revelation or an
insight into what consciousness

00:22:19.315 --> 00:22:21.360
is.

00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:24.455
So I take this to be
a very rich example.

00:22:24.455 --> 00:22:26.330
And I could spend the
whole talk just talking

00:22:26.330 --> 00:22:27.121
about this example.

00:22:29.550 --> 00:22:33.290
And I won't, but I'll just
mention as a footnote,

00:22:33.290 --> 00:22:36.520
it's interesting to think
about, to compare this

00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:39.862
to a platonic or
Socratic dialogue.

00:22:39.862 --> 00:22:42.070
The kind of transformation
that happens in this visit

00:22:42.070 --> 00:22:44.130
to the gallery for me
is very much like what

00:22:44.130 --> 00:22:46.905
happens between Socrates
and his interlocutors

00:22:46.905 --> 00:22:49.070
and their dialogues.

00:22:49.070 --> 00:22:51.900
But there is one last note
I'll mention before I go on,

00:22:51.900 --> 00:22:53.950
more substantively.

00:22:53.950 --> 00:22:57.900
And that is, I think this
example also gives us

00:22:57.900 --> 00:23:01.040
a hint as to what
goes on when we think

00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:05.021
about the boringness of art.

00:23:05.021 --> 00:23:05.520
Welcome.

00:23:09.290 --> 00:23:13.790
Because what's
striking about-- what

00:23:13.790 --> 00:23:18.470
was required to set
the stage for you

00:23:18.470 --> 00:23:22.110
to see what you couldn't
see or to see what you saw

00:23:22.110 --> 00:23:24.830
but differently,
what was required

00:23:24.830 --> 00:23:28.890
was a kind of a disruption,
a moment of not being

00:23:28.890 --> 00:23:32.200
able to see it, a
confrontation with stuff

00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:34.580
that all looked the same.

00:23:34.580 --> 00:23:36.999
And in our natural,
habitual, organized living,

00:23:36.999 --> 00:23:39.290
the natural thing to do when
everything looks the same,

00:23:39.290 --> 00:23:42.050
is uninteresting,
is to keep on going.

00:23:42.050 --> 00:23:45.090
But what the work
ritually-- sort

00:23:45.090 --> 00:23:47.490
of the art situation
invited you to do

00:23:47.490 --> 00:23:50.350
was to disrupt those habits,
to put the email away,

00:23:50.350 --> 00:23:52.109
to stop the
conversation-- rather,

00:23:52.109 --> 00:23:53.900
the conversation that's
unrelated to what's

00:23:53.900 --> 00:23:56.740
going on around you,
and look to the work.

00:23:56.740 --> 00:23:59.980
And so I think, we begin to see
a way in which the work creates

00:23:59.980 --> 00:24:04.260
a setting in which boredom
is a stage through which you

00:24:04.260 --> 00:24:07.675
have to go to make discovery.

00:24:10.300 --> 00:24:12.980
So that's a first pass.

00:24:12.980 --> 00:24:19.652
I now want to approach these
issues, these very same issues,

00:24:19.652 --> 00:24:21.110
but in a slightly
different manner.

00:24:24.650 --> 00:24:27.380
And just in case any of
you are pressed for time,

00:24:27.380 --> 00:24:30.380
I'm thinking that I'll probably
go about 20 more minutes.

00:24:30.380 --> 00:24:32.088
And then there'll be
time for discussion.

00:24:39.950 --> 00:24:44.127
OK, so cut to a new situation.

00:24:44.127 --> 00:24:44.710
We're mammals.

00:24:47.460 --> 00:24:52.900
And the hallmark of mammals is
that they suckle at the breast.

00:24:55.810 --> 00:25:00.320
It turns out that,
of all the mammals,

00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:02.740
humans are really
bad at breastfeeding.

00:25:05.611 --> 00:25:08.720
So bad are we at
breastfeeding, that it's

00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:12.070
been hypothesized that the
function that breastfeeding

00:25:12.070 --> 00:25:15.610
plays for us isn't
primarily feeding,

00:25:15.610 --> 00:25:17.480
but rather that we
feed that way in order

00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:20.086
to accomplish something else.

00:25:20.086 --> 00:25:21.460
When I say that
we're about it, I

00:25:21.460 --> 00:25:26.730
mean most mammals will draw
milk until they're stated

00:25:26.730 --> 00:25:30.080
or until another
sibling makes them stop,

00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:31.670
but not the human being.

00:25:31.670 --> 00:25:34.790
The human being falls asleep.

00:25:34.790 --> 00:25:38.610
The human being hears
a noise and stops.

00:25:38.610 --> 00:25:41.270
And as a result of this,
the mother-- and this

00:25:41.270 --> 00:25:42.930
goes for breastfeeding
just as well,

00:25:42.930 --> 00:25:45.950
it has nothing to do with
the mother-- excuse me,

00:25:45.950 --> 00:25:47.750
with bottle feeding
just as well.

00:25:47.750 --> 00:25:48.830
It needn't be the mother.

00:25:48.830 --> 00:25:51.840
It needn't be a woman who's
engaged in this interaction.

00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:57.380
But what happens is that the
breastfeeder or the feeder

00:25:57.380 --> 00:25:59.530
needs to have a
negotiation with the infant

00:25:59.530 --> 00:26:02.360
in order to help
the feeding happen.

00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:06.270
So a typical kind
of scenario is baby

00:26:06.270 --> 00:26:10.270
feeds and then falls to sleep.

00:26:10.270 --> 00:26:12.380
Mother notices that the
baby has fallen asleep,

00:26:12.380 --> 00:26:14.240
and jiggles the baby, and
draws its attention back

00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:15.973
to the task at hand. [CLAPS]
And then there's a loud sound,

00:26:15.973 --> 00:26:18.535
and the baby turns, and looks at
the sound, and gets distracted.

00:26:18.535 --> 00:26:20.035
And the mother
notices that the baby

00:26:20.035 --> 00:26:22.480
is no longer feeding
and coaxes the baby back

00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:25.200
to the task at hand, and so on.

00:26:29.750 --> 00:26:33.890
I'd like you to
notice six features

00:26:33.890 --> 00:26:37.840
of this interaction
between infant and feeder

00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:40.450
that I've just described.

00:26:40.450 --> 00:26:44.270
The first is that in some fairly
straightforward obvious sense

00:26:44.270 --> 00:26:48.885
it's primitive, it's
spontaneous, it's biological,

00:26:48.885 --> 00:26:49.715
it's natural.

00:26:53.650 --> 00:26:56.590
But notice-- and this
is the second feature--

00:26:56.590 --> 00:26:58.020
that for all that
it's spontaneous

00:26:58.020 --> 00:26:59.830
and primitive and
biological and natural,

00:26:59.830 --> 00:27:08.150
it's also incredibly
sophisticated in the suite

00:27:08.150 --> 00:27:10.850
of cognitive and
perceptual skills

00:27:10.850 --> 00:27:15.160
that are exercised during it--
doing, undergoing looking,

00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:18.890
listening, noticing,
responding, communicating.

00:27:18.890 --> 00:27:23.790
It's a very subtle
exchange that happens.

00:27:23.790 --> 00:27:24.745
It exhibits smarts.

00:27:27.420 --> 00:27:31.610
Here's a third feature of
the breastfeeding scenario.

00:27:31.610 --> 00:27:34.990
It has a kind of spatial,
temporal dynamics.

00:27:38.120 --> 00:27:41.940
It involves rocking and
something like turn taking.

00:27:41.940 --> 00:27:47.560
In fact, it's been noticed
that it's sort of remarkable

00:27:47.560 --> 00:27:50.900
that the one mammalian species
with full-blown linguistic

00:27:50.900 --> 00:27:54.880
powers is also the
one species that

00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:59.760
has this kind of problematic
style of breastfeeding,

00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:02.110
almost as if to suggest that
the breastfeeding itself is

00:28:02.110 --> 00:28:05.450
a kind of practice
run for conversation,

00:28:05.450 --> 00:28:10.110
a kind of primitive
form of conversation.

00:28:10.110 --> 00:28:11.990
Here's a fourth feature.

00:28:11.990 --> 00:28:14.410
Breastfeeding is--
I mean, the mother

00:28:14.410 --> 00:28:16.980
is obviously the authority
figure in that exchange.

00:28:16.980 --> 00:28:18.500
But this dynamic
I'm talking about

00:28:18.500 --> 00:28:21.150
is not one that she
dictates or authors.

00:28:21.150 --> 00:28:24.700
It emerges in the dynamic
interaction between them.

00:28:24.700 --> 00:28:27.730
So this structure, this temporal
dynamic, this turn taking

00:28:27.730 --> 00:28:32.420
is not written-- it evolves,
it happens, it emerges.

00:28:36.370 --> 00:28:38.390
Here's a fifth future.

00:28:38.390 --> 00:28:41.440
Breastfeeding obviously
has a function.

00:28:41.440 --> 00:28:45.310
It's embedded in needs--
probably the needs for feeding,

00:28:45.310 --> 00:28:47.050
but maybe other
needs, like the needs

00:28:47.050 --> 00:28:50.480
for the release of oxytocin and
the establishment of attachment

00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:52.160
relationships.

00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:54.750
Maybe that's why we
breastfeed-- so that we

00:28:54.750 --> 00:28:59.790
can enter into that kind of
intense, dyadic relationship

00:28:59.790 --> 00:29:01.680
that is so important
in our lives.

00:29:04.460 --> 00:29:07.850
And the sixth future
that I want to mention

00:29:07.850 --> 00:29:11.760
is that breastfeeding
is a place, or a site,

00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:14.980
or an occasion, or an
opportunity for feeling,

00:29:14.980 --> 00:29:18.410
or for affect, and indeed, if
all goes well, for pleasure.

00:29:21.220 --> 00:29:24.620
Now, the reason why I'm
describing breastfeeding

00:29:24.620 --> 00:29:27.090
in my lecture on arts
at such great length

00:29:27.090 --> 00:29:32.350
is that I actually think
that breastfeeding exhibits

00:29:32.350 --> 00:29:34.510
a structure which
turns out to be

00:29:34.510 --> 00:29:38.357
very important for understanding
human life more generally.

00:29:38.357 --> 00:29:40.440
I'd like to say that
breastfeeding is an organized

00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:41.355
activity.

00:29:41.355 --> 00:29:43.110
Now, organized activity,
that's English.

00:29:43.110 --> 00:29:44.390
That's not technical language.

00:29:44.390 --> 00:29:46.240
But I want to use it
in a precise sense

00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:49.680
and so in a technical sense
to mean an activity that

00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:52.960
exhibits those six features--
that it's primitive and yet

00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:54.810
cognitively sophisticated,
that it exhibits

00:29:54.810 --> 00:29:57.555
a spatial, temporal dynamics
without being authored,

00:29:57.555 --> 00:30:00.650
that it has a function, and that
it can be a source for pleasure

00:30:00.650 --> 00:30:02.550
or feeling.

00:30:02.550 --> 00:30:05.500
And I want to say that
any other activity that

00:30:05.500 --> 00:30:10.800
exhibits those six features
is an organized activity too.

00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:12.520
So I'm using the
example of breastfeeding

00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:14.900
to introduce a concept--
the concept of an organized

00:30:14.900 --> 00:30:16.240
activity.

00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:22.240
And what I want to offer you is
the thought that, once you've

00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:24.320
got the category of
the organized activity,

00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:28.460
organized activities are
very widespread in our lives.

00:30:28.460 --> 00:30:32.000
Everywhere you look, you see
organization of this kind--

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:34.780
un-authored modes
of organization

00:30:34.780 --> 00:30:40.970
in which we find ourselves, as
it were, by habit caught up.

00:30:40.970 --> 00:30:42.950
Take conversation itself.

00:30:42.950 --> 00:30:45.282
We think of
conversation in a sort

00:30:45.282 --> 00:30:47.490
of classical, Western,
intellectualist, philosophical

00:30:47.490 --> 00:30:49.940
way, as two intellects
expressing thoughts

00:30:49.940 --> 00:30:53.310
in the garb of language,
using a code to communicate.

00:30:53.310 --> 00:30:55.060
But if you actually
watch people talking--

00:30:55.060 --> 00:30:58.900
and there's a very
well-established and decades

00:30:58.900 --> 00:31:03.660
old literature on this-- if you
actually watch people talking,

00:31:03.660 --> 00:31:05.160
something goes on
between them which

00:31:05.160 --> 00:31:07.570
is much like breastfeeding.

00:31:07.570 --> 00:31:10.120
So when two people
talk together,

00:31:10.120 --> 00:31:14.305
their bodily
posture, their tilt,

00:31:14.305 --> 00:31:16.700
their attitude in
relation to what's

00:31:16.700 --> 00:31:21.340
going around them, their
eye movements, their volume,

00:31:21.340 --> 00:31:24.060
their distance in relation
to each other and things

00:31:24.060 --> 00:31:28.940
around them, and their word
choice are all modulated.

00:31:28.940 --> 00:31:30.500
There's this
incredible coordination

00:31:30.500 --> 00:31:31.990
that happens between them.

00:31:31.990 --> 00:31:34.290
It happens spontaneously.

00:31:34.290 --> 00:31:37.640
It's the very essence
of intelligence

00:31:37.640 --> 00:31:39.280
to be able to participate in it.

00:31:39.280 --> 00:31:40.990
It's thoughtful.

00:31:40.990 --> 00:31:45.010
It has a clear-- it's a
spatial, temporal thing.

00:31:45.010 --> 00:31:47.830
It's a dynamic of interaction
between the people

00:31:47.830 --> 00:31:50.910
talking, which neither of
them is deciding to do.

00:31:50.910 --> 00:31:52.080
It's not by choice.

00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:53.427
It's not authored.

00:31:53.427 --> 00:31:54.885
Conversation is
clearly functional.

00:31:54.885 --> 00:31:57.070
And conversation, when all
goes well, is clearly, at least

00:31:57.070 --> 00:31:58.486
potentially, a
source of pleasure.

00:31:58.486 --> 00:32:00.660
It's definitely a place
where we have feelings.

00:32:00.660 --> 00:32:04.520
Conversation is an
organized activity.

00:32:04.520 --> 00:32:07.477
In my first book,
"Action in Perception"--

00:32:07.477 --> 00:32:09.310
and I'm not going to
review that book here--

00:32:09.310 --> 00:32:13.870
but I'll just say that I argued
that perception is an activity

00:32:13.870 --> 00:32:17.070
of exploring the environment,
making use of a certain kind

00:32:17.070 --> 00:32:18.425
of sensorimotor skill.

00:32:18.425 --> 00:32:21.820
I used the word activity
there without, at the time,

00:32:21.820 --> 00:32:23.540
having a clear idea
of how to analyze

00:32:23.540 --> 00:32:25.550
what activity might mean.

00:32:25.550 --> 00:32:28.510
But I now would like
to say-- and in my book

00:32:28.510 --> 00:32:30.820
I try to develop the thought--
that the relevant kind

00:32:30.820 --> 00:32:35.060
of activity that perception is,
is an organized activity, one

00:32:35.060 --> 00:32:36.910
that needn't involve
other people.

00:32:36.910 --> 00:32:39.452
So every time you move, you
produce a sensory event.

00:32:39.452 --> 00:32:41.910
You move your eyes, you move
your head, you move your body,

00:32:41.910 --> 00:32:43.160
you produce a sensory event.

00:32:43.160 --> 00:32:45.550
You approach an object, it
looms in your visual field.

00:32:45.550 --> 00:32:49.150
You blink, you modulate your
sensory relationship to it.

00:32:49.150 --> 00:32:55.130
We have a kind of dynamic
exchange with things around us,

00:32:55.130 --> 00:32:58.230
that I think exhibits the
six features that I just

00:32:58.230 --> 00:33:02.870
enumerated, that are definitive
of organized activity.

00:33:02.870 --> 00:33:05.550
So the conclusion that I
want to make at this point

00:33:05.550 --> 00:33:08.000
is that we are organized.

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:11.080
We are organized
throughout our lives.

00:33:11.080 --> 00:33:13.235
By the way, just little
note, a big theme

00:33:13.235 --> 00:33:14.860
in the book and the
reason why the book

00:33:14.860 --> 00:33:18.520
is called "Strange
Tools" is that I think

00:33:18.520 --> 00:33:22.800
a major part of the story, about
how organized activities work

00:33:22.800 --> 00:33:26.160
in our lives, is
technology and tools.

00:33:26.160 --> 00:33:29.699
Just to be very simple
right now, tools I think

00:33:29.699 --> 00:33:31.740
function in the setting
of modes of organization.

00:33:31.740 --> 00:33:34.670
So you can look at the thing,
you could talk about technology

00:33:34.670 --> 00:33:37.170
by looking at the evolution of
the technologies themselves,

00:33:37.170 --> 00:33:40.190
or you can think of them as
evolving modes of organization.

00:33:40.190 --> 00:33:45.400
Every tool, every technology
is I think the hub of organized

00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:46.440
activities.

00:33:46.440 --> 00:33:49.020
It's the focal point.

00:33:49.020 --> 00:33:53.180
If you like, it's the
organizing principle.

00:33:53.180 --> 00:33:58.850
It's the thing which sets up
and gets the organization going.

00:33:58.850 --> 00:34:02.370
So organization of this kind
is very, very widespread

00:34:02.370 --> 00:34:04.389
in our lives.

00:34:04.389 --> 00:34:06.305
One friend of mine who
read this book early on

00:34:06.305 --> 00:34:07.700
said, organized activity
sounds like you're

00:34:07.700 --> 00:34:08.991
writing for a business seminar.

00:34:08.991 --> 00:34:10.790
Don't talk about
organized activities.

00:34:10.790 --> 00:34:14.110
But I think I like the
word organization too,

00:34:14.110 --> 00:34:24.020
because organization is linked
to organism and to biology.

00:34:24.020 --> 00:34:25.610
We are organisms.

00:34:25.610 --> 00:34:27.820
And if there's anything
that distinctively marks off

00:34:27.820 --> 00:34:30.380
the difference between the
organic and the inorganic,

00:34:30.380 --> 00:34:33.530
is its capacity for, as
Immanuel Kant put it,

00:34:33.530 --> 00:34:36.870
self-organization of
something like this kind.

00:34:36.870 --> 00:34:40.620
So I want to offer the
thought that A, organization

00:34:40.620 --> 00:34:43.000
of this kind, what I'm
calling organized activity,

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:44.370
is ubiquitous in our life.

00:34:44.370 --> 00:34:46.500
In some sense, our lives
are nested structures

00:34:46.500 --> 00:34:49.689
of organized activities or
structures of nested organized

00:34:49.689 --> 00:34:50.189
activities.

00:34:53.239 --> 00:34:56.000
I want to suggest that this
has something to do with what

00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:59.770
we are as a biological animal.

00:34:59.770 --> 00:35:02.230
This has to do with our biology.

00:35:02.230 --> 00:35:05.450
And therefore, any account
of organized activity,

00:35:05.450 --> 00:35:07.820
which is going to
be adequate, needs--

00:35:07.820 --> 00:35:10.140
or rather, any account
of our biology that

00:35:10.140 --> 00:35:12.350
is going to be adequate to
account for human nature

00:35:12.350 --> 00:35:14.359
needs to have something
to say about this kind

00:35:14.359 --> 00:35:15.025
of organization.

00:35:19.050 --> 00:35:21.650
And finally, and this
is a more soft point,

00:35:21.650 --> 00:35:26.690
but I think we're lost in the
seas of our own organization.

00:35:26.690 --> 00:35:28.240
We don't organize ourselves.

00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:30.590
We find ourselves organized.

00:35:30.590 --> 00:35:32.340
Sort of the image
that-- as I was thinking

00:35:32.340 --> 00:35:34.756
about how I was going to present
this to you this morning,

00:35:34.756 --> 00:35:38.010
I had his image that popped into
my mind of Gregor Samsa, who

00:35:38.010 --> 00:35:39.485
wakes up one day
in the Kafka story

00:35:39.485 --> 00:35:42.740
and finds that he's
turned into an insect.

00:35:42.740 --> 00:35:44.500
We just find
ourselves organized.

00:35:44.500 --> 00:35:47.020
It doesn't necessarily
terrify us.

00:35:47.020 --> 00:35:48.690
But we just find
ourselves organized.

00:35:48.690 --> 00:35:51.197
So it's sort of an
existential issue for us

00:35:51.197 --> 00:35:53.030
to get a better
understanding of the ways we

00:35:53.030 --> 00:35:55.250
find ourselves organized.

00:35:55.250 --> 00:35:59.170
Moving on, here's
another example

00:35:59.170 --> 00:36:01.290
of an organized activity.

00:36:01.290 --> 00:36:05.820
I don't think this will be
controversial at all-- dancing.

00:36:05.820 --> 00:36:09.710
Dancing is spontaneous
and seems to be

00:36:09.710 --> 00:36:16.060
primitive for human beings,
exceptionally for human beings.

00:36:16.060 --> 00:36:20.360
When people dance, that involves
the exquisite control, not just

00:36:20.360 --> 00:36:23.520
of their bodies, but of
their attention-- attention

00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:26.960
to music or attention to the
person they're dancing with.

00:36:26.960 --> 00:36:30.880
So it's a very
intelligent activity.

00:36:30.880 --> 00:36:32.570
Obviously, it's
spatiotemporally,

00:36:32.570 --> 00:36:34.560
rhythmically organized.

00:36:34.560 --> 00:36:40.710
I assume dancing serves
functions, social functions.

00:36:40.710 --> 00:36:44.940
People dance to meet people.

00:36:44.940 --> 00:36:47.040
People dance to celebrate.

00:36:47.040 --> 00:36:48.040
People dance to mourn.

00:36:48.040 --> 00:36:49.665
People dance to
express their feelings.

00:36:49.665 --> 00:36:54.480
Those are functions in my book.

00:36:54.480 --> 00:36:56.580
I like to illustrate
this idea that dancing

00:36:56.580 --> 00:37:02.590
has a function by recalling
the character of Tony

00:37:02.590 --> 00:37:09.610
Manero in the 1979 movie
"Saturday Night Fever."

00:37:09.610 --> 00:37:11.880
Any of you old enough to
remember "Saturday Night

00:37:11.880 --> 00:37:13.100
Fever"?

00:37:13.100 --> 00:37:15.500
Well, darn it, if you haven't
seen it, see it tonight.

00:37:15.500 --> 00:37:17.062
It's a good movie.

00:37:17.062 --> 00:37:19.395
And it will take you back to
the glorious days of disco,

00:37:19.395 --> 00:37:21.200
when I grew up.

00:37:21.200 --> 00:37:23.140
But it's about a character.

00:37:23.140 --> 00:37:27.071
It's played by John Travolta
named Tony Manero, who

00:37:27.071 --> 00:37:27.820
lives in Brooklyn.

00:37:27.820 --> 00:37:32.410
And to make a fairly
long story short,

00:37:32.410 --> 00:37:35.110
he's got a pretty grim life.

00:37:35.110 --> 00:37:36.920
His father is abusive.

00:37:36.920 --> 00:37:40.080
His mother is under his thumb.

00:37:40.080 --> 00:37:42.150
He has a job, which
he doesn't do well.

00:37:42.150 --> 00:37:43.570
He's a clerk in
a hardware store.

00:37:43.570 --> 00:37:45.500
And his boss, who's
kind of a good guy,

00:37:45.500 --> 00:37:47.900
nevertheless is constantly
getting on this case.

00:37:47.900 --> 00:37:52.000
His life is full of
drudgery and displeasure,

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:54.850
until Saturday
night comes, when he

00:37:54.850 --> 00:37:58.180
puts on this duds-- his
beautiful, fancy, three-piece,

00:37:58.180 --> 00:38:01.660
white, bell-bottom suit and
goes dancing at the disco.

00:38:01.660 --> 00:38:03.305
And boy, does he dance.

00:38:03.305 --> 00:38:05.110
He dances better
than all the others.

00:38:05.110 --> 00:38:07.230
His friends go out and
all want different things.

00:38:07.230 --> 00:38:09.704
Some of his friends are
going out to score girls.

00:38:09.704 --> 00:38:11.870
Some of his friends are
actually going out to fight,

00:38:11.870 --> 00:38:13.420
because they're
sort of gangsters.

00:38:13.420 --> 00:38:14.960
He's dancing.

00:38:14.960 --> 00:38:16.100
But why does he dance?

00:38:16.100 --> 00:38:21.740
He dances, I think, in
order to manifest himself,

00:38:21.740 --> 00:38:28.110
in order to actualize himself,
in order to find himself,

00:38:28.110 --> 00:38:31.940
and in order to present
himself to the world

00:38:31.940 --> 00:38:34.490
as a thing of value,
which is sexy, and strong,

00:38:34.490 --> 00:38:37.620
and healthy, and young,
and not caught up

00:38:37.620 --> 00:38:40.760
in this rather grim and
unpleasant life situation

00:38:40.760 --> 00:38:42.000
that he has.

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:45.200
So for him, I would
submit-- and I'm just

00:38:45.200 --> 00:38:46.850
choosing this as an
example, you don't

00:38:46.850 --> 00:38:49.470
have to look far to
find other examples-- it

00:38:49.470 --> 00:38:52.620
shows the kind of
psychological functions

00:38:52.620 --> 00:38:55.132
that dancing can have.

00:38:55.132 --> 00:38:57.980
As for the other two, dancing is
obviously a source of pleasure.

00:38:57.980 --> 00:39:01.100
And I think, when people dance,
they don't decide what to do.

00:39:01.100 --> 00:39:02.460
They can decide what to do.

00:39:02.460 --> 00:39:04.720
But as a general
rule, dancing happens.

00:39:04.720 --> 00:39:06.635
People get caught
up in their dances.

00:39:06.635 --> 00:39:08.155
They get into the flow.

00:39:08.155 --> 00:39:10.130
The situation dances for them.

00:39:10.130 --> 00:39:12.540
But John Travolta is a sort
of bad example of that,

00:39:12.540 --> 00:39:14.600
because they dance all
these very fixed move

00:39:14.600 --> 00:39:16.766
steps, like the Hustle and
all these kinds of things

00:39:16.766 --> 00:39:19.460
that they do in the
discotheques of the late '70s.

00:39:19.460 --> 00:39:24.150
But the point stands, dancing
is an organized activity.

00:39:24.150 --> 00:39:30.660
And now, now we come to art.

00:39:33.450 --> 00:39:37.630
I chose dancing, because
dancing has a relationship

00:39:37.630 --> 00:39:39.970
to choreography.

00:39:39.970 --> 00:39:44.430
Choreography is the
art of dancing--

00:39:44.430 --> 00:39:47.770
to give it a quick summation.

00:39:47.770 --> 00:39:51.980
And my question to you
is, how does choreography

00:39:51.980 --> 00:39:56.140
fit in relation to
organized activity?

00:39:56.140 --> 00:39:59.444
Is choreography an
organized activity?

00:39:59.444 --> 00:40:01.860
And you might say, well, yeah,
choreographers make dances,

00:40:01.860 --> 00:40:04.210
and dancing is an
organized activity.

00:40:04.210 --> 00:40:06.550
But not so fast.

00:40:06.550 --> 00:40:10.700
If I'm right that dancing is an
organized activity, that it's

00:40:10.700 --> 00:40:15.140
something that we get caught
up in and that organizes us,

00:40:15.140 --> 00:40:17.530
and that serves these
kinds of embedded functions

00:40:17.530 --> 00:40:22.550
in our lives, and
that we don't author,

00:40:22.550 --> 00:40:26.740
then you can't make dancing.

00:40:26.740 --> 00:40:29.617
It's not the kind of
thing you can make.

00:40:29.617 --> 00:40:31.200
Well, you might say,
the choreographer

00:40:31.200 --> 00:40:36.680
doesn't make dancing but the
choreographer stages dancing.

00:40:36.680 --> 00:40:38.600
And there, I want to
say, yes, exactly.

00:40:38.600 --> 00:40:40.360
So what does that mean?

00:40:40.360 --> 00:40:43.300
What does it mean
to stage a dance?

00:40:43.300 --> 00:40:47.000
Well, it means to put
a dance on the stage,

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:52.230
or put dancing on the stage,
or put the fact that people

00:40:52.230 --> 00:40:56.080
are dancers on the stage, or put
the fact that we are organized

00:40:56.080 --> 00:40:59.130
by dancing itself
on display, or put

00:40:59.130 --> 00:41:02.120
the fact that
dancing matters to us

00:41:02.120 --> 00:41:04.340
in the center of our attention.

00:41:04.340 --> 00:41:05.900
In other words,
the choreographer

00:41:05.900 --> 00:41:07.530
is not doing more dancing.

00:41:07.530 --> 00:41:12.740
The choreographer is, in a
way, investigating the place

00:41:12.740 --> 00:41:16.780
that dancing has in
our lives already.

00:41:16.780 --> 00:41:20.230
The choreographer is
exhibiting that we

00:41:20.230 --> 00:41:21.275
are dancers to ourselves.

00:41:24.460 --> 00:41:32.480
Now, two points about that, one
is if organized activities have

00:41:32.480 --> 00:41:42.030
this link to biology, and
if dancing is an organized

00:41:42.030 --> 00:41:47.090
activity, and if choreography
is exhibiting or investigating

00:41:47.090 --> 00:41:50.770
dancing in something like
the way I'm suggesting,

00:41:50.770 --> 00:41:55.830
then we begin to see a way of
thinking about how choreography

00:41:55.830 --> 00:42:01.240
is meshing with biology,
meshing with the investigation

00:42:01.240 --> 00:42:04.570
of ourselves thought
of biologically,

00:42:04.570 --> 00:42:06.570
or thought of naturally.

00:42:06.570 --> 00:42:08.900
It's grappling with
our nature, just as

00:42:08.900 --> 00:42:11.470
through a thin slice of it,
the dancing slice of it.

00:42:15.470 --> 00:42:18.820
Secondly, I said
before that we're lost

00:42:18.820 --> 00:42:21.590
in these nests of organization.

00:42:21.590 --> 00:42:29.350
My thought is that by
choreography putting dancing

00:42:29.350 --> 00:42:33.080
in our lives on display
in the ways that it does,

00:42:33.080 --> 00:42:37.590
choreography is, if you like,
enabling us to get found,

00:42:37.590 --> 00:42:39.820
if that's correct English.

00:42:39.820 --> 00:42:45.770
It is orienting us or disclosing
to ourselves this fact

00:42:45.770 --> 00:42:49.340
about ourselves
and, thus, helping

00:42:49.340 --> 00:42:57.050
us be what we are, but, if you
like, without feeling lost.

00:42:57.050 --> 00:43:01.150
Wittgenstein once said
that philosophical problems

00:43:01.150 --> 00:43:03.730
have the form, I don't
know my way about.

00:43:03.730 --> 00:43:07.800
So dancing in a way gives us
a perspicuous representation

00:43:07.800 --> 00:43:10.100
of where we are.

00:43:10.100 --> 00:43:13.120
Heidegger your once said that
philosophical problems are

00:43:13.120 --> 00:43:15.750
bringing what's
concealed into the open.

00:43:15.750 --> 00:43:18.050
And I'm suggesting that
choreography brings something

00:43:18.050 --> 00:43:21.280
concealed about us
that we are organized

00:43:21.280 --> 00:43:23.590
by dancing into the open.

00:43:28.110 --> 00:43:34.150
So the work of choreography
is both philosophical

00:43:34.150 --> 00:43:37.660
and also relevant to biology.

00:43:40.860 --> 00:43:43.550
It makes a contribution
in that sense

00:43:43.550 --> 00:43:46.785
to some kind of an
account of ourselves

00:43:46.785 --> 00:43:47.785
biologically understood.

00:43:50.016 --> 00:43:51.390
And this goes back
to the thought

00:43:51.390 --> 00:43:53.240
I shared with you
at the beginning

00:43:53.240 --> 00:43:56.347
that maybe far from it's
been the case that scientists

00:43:56.347 --> 00:43:58.430
and neuroscientists and
evolutionary psychologists

00:43:58.430 --> 00:44:01.430
are going to explain
art, maybe art

00:44:01.430 --> 00:44:05.310
is going to help us frame
a more adequate conception

00:44:05.310 --> 00:44:06.625
of our nature.

00:44:06.625 --> 00:44:08.750
And this is, I think, an
example of the kind of way

00:44:08.750 --> 00:44:10.760
in which it could happen.

00:44:10.760 --> 00:44:13.390
Now again, from what I just
said, I hope it's clear,

00:44:13.390 --> 00:44:16.540
I've chosen choreography
as, if you like,

00:44:16.540 --> 00:44:18.635
a random art practice.

00:44:21.310 --> 00:44:23.310
And so what I want to say
about the relationship

00:44:23.310 --> 00:44:25.610
between choreography
and dancing,

00:44:25.610 --> 00:44:28.690
I want to say that something
like that very same relation

00:44:28.690 --> 00:44:32.960
holds between all the parts and
the different activities that

00:44:32.960 --> 00:44:35.990
organize us.

00:44:35.990 --> 00:44:39.640
Now, I have two more ideas
I want to share with you

00:44:39.640 --> 00:44:42.790
before I conclude.

00:44:42.790 --> 00:44:45.924
One way to summarize what I just
said is that there's dancing

00:44:45.924 --> 00:44:47.340
and there's
choreography, where we

00:44:47.340 --> 00:44:48.940
can think of dancing
as a first order

00:44:48.940 --> 00:44:53.860
organized activity and
choreography as, if you like,

00:44:53.860 --> 00:44:56.990
a second order representation
of dancing in our lives,

00:44:56.990 --> 00:44:58.020
a kind of meta-dancing.

00:45:00.155 --> 00:45:01.363
I called it an investigation.

00:45:04.850 --> 00:45:06.500
I think it's very
important to realize

00:45:06.500 --> 00:45:09.300
that, although what I said just
now, that summation is kind

00:45:09.300 --> 00:45:15.010
of notionally accurate,
it doesn't do justice

00:45:15.010 --> 00:45:20.170
to the reality, because
in reality, what happens

00:45:20.170 --> 00:45:28.030
is practices, such
as choreography,

00:45:28.030 --> 00:45:31.160
influence the way people dance.

00:45:31.160 --> 00:45:37.100
They loop back down and change
the first order expression

00:45:37.100 --> 00:45:39.090
of dancing.

00:45:39.090 --> 00:45:43.810
And they do so in ways
that iterate recursively

00:45:43.810 --> 00:45:48.830
through history, so that
in fact for us, embedded

00:45:48.830 --> 00:45:51.500
as we are in
history and culture,

00:45:51.500 --> 00:45:57.530
there's no such thing as dancing
immune to the model of what

00:45:57.530 --> 00:46:00.900
dancing is, which
choreography provides to us,

00:46:00.900 --> 00:46:07.940
whether it's Michael
Jackson or whoever, Mick

00:46:07.940 --> 00:46:12.347
Jagger, or your mother in
the kitchen, who taught me

00:46:12.347 --> 00:46:13.180
how to do the twist.

00:46:16.360 --> 00:46:20.540
Whatever the source
is, our first order

00:46:20.540 --> 00:46:25.370
lived experience with dancing
is already shaped and influenced

00:46:25.370 --> 00:46:30.430
by second order artistic
grapplings with the place

00:46:30.430 --> 00:46:33.600
of dancing in our lives, or
I might say with second order

00:46:33.600 --> 00:46:35.395
philosophical grapplings
with the place

00:46:35.395 --> 00:46:36.395
of dancing in our lives.

00:46:39.930 --> 00:46:43.340
That means that
even kids dancing

00:46:43.340 --> 00:46:50.190
at the discotheque, whoever
they may be, are in an art space

00:46:50.190 --> 00:46:52.220
even if they don't
have those intentions

00:46:52.220 --> 00:46:55.450
and if they're not
participating in an art world.

00:46:55.450 --> 00:46:57.200
And by the way, this
looping phenomenon

00:46:57.200 --> 00:46:58.785
is very, very widespread.

00:46:58.785 --> 00:47:02.494
And my book discusses this in
a lot of different examples.

00:47:02.494 --> 00:47:04.660
An important example-- I'm
just going to mention it,

00:47:04.660 --> 00:47:06.160
because I don't
want to tire you out

00:47:06.160 --> 00:47:08.300
with new ideas-- but
an interesting example

00:47:08.300 --> 00:47:10.790
is writing and language.

00:47:10.790 --> 00:47:12.570
Speech is one thing.

00:47:12.570 --> 00:47:14.610
Writing is another.

00:47:14.610 --> 00:47:20.220
But we, I mean us, live
in a scriptorial culture.

00:47:20.220 --> 00:47:23.110
And our conception
of language, indeed

00:47:23.110 --> 00:47:27.110
our conception of our own
experience as talkers,

00:47:27.110 --> 00:47:32.025
is permeated through and through
by the picture of what language

00:47:32.025 --> 00:47:35.650
is that writing provides us.

00:47:35.650 --> 00:47:36.830
So writing is second order.

00:47:36.830 --> 00:47:37.770
Speech is first order.

00:47:37.770 --> 00:47:40.000
But in fact, it loops
back down and transforms,

00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:44.080
so it's a much more complex
two-directional thing.

00:47:44.080 --> 00:47:46.665
I think something very
similar goes on with pictures.

00:47:51.240 --> 00:47:53.560
I'll just summarize
it in a sentence.

00:47:53.560 --> 00:47:57.440
I think pictures have
changed the way we see.

00:47:57.440 --> 00:47:59.190
And that's a very
interesting fact

00:47:59.190 --> 00:48:00.565
when you consider
that we've been

00:48:00.565 --> 00:48:03.000
making pictures of the
highest quality for at least

00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:07.830
30,000 years.

00:48:07.830 --> 00:48:12.020
So now, the point of
this last set of remarks

00:48:12.020 --> 00:48:15.930
is to explain why I say
reorganizational practice,

00:48:15.930 --> 00:48:19.490
because art doesn't just exhibit
our organization to ourselves,

00:48:19.490 --> 00:48:21.050
it reorganizes us.

00:48:21.050 --> 00:48:28.540
And it does so not by sort
of consciously giving us

00:48:28.540 --> 00:48:31.360
tools for reorganizing
ourselves, it just changes us.

00:48:31.360 --> 00:48:33.620
And this is very
interesting, because it

00:48:33.620 --> 00:48:36.030
points to-- I don't know
if I emphasized this

00:48:36.030 --> 00:48:38.340
well enough in the
book-- but it points

00:48:38.340 --> 00:48:41.900
to what you might call the
emancipatory value of art.

00:48:41.900 --> 00:48:44.620
The fact of the matter is that
all these organized activities,

00:48:44.620 --> 00:48:48.500
they're habits that were trapped
inside-- ways of looking,

00:48:48.500 --> 00:48:50.620
ways of moving, ways of
seeing, ways of talking,

00:48:50.620 --> 00:48:53.280
ways of thinking,
ways of dressing.

00:48:58.200 --> 00:49:01.310
They are ways that were
organized not voluntarily.

00:49:01.310 --> 00:49:07.200
And art, I think, always changes
that, and thus changes us,

00:49:07.200 --> 00:49:10.740
and in a sense liberates us.

00:49:10.740 --> 00:49:13.900
Final thought before
I stop, I said

00:49:13.900 --> 00:49:17.540
before that Tony Manero says,
look at me, I'm beautiful,

00:49:17.540 --> 00:49:19.450
I'm sexy, I'm young.

00:49:19.450 --> 00:49:20.500
Check me out.

00:49:20.500 --> 00:49:21.700
That's his motto.

00:49:21.700 --> 00:49:25.760
His motto is check me out.

00:49:25.760 --> 00:49:31.530
I think that's exactly not
the work of art's motto.

00:49:31.530 --> 00:49:34.080
The work of art doesn't
say, check me out.

00:49:34.080 --> 00:49:36.600
The work of art says
something more like,

00:49:36.600 --> 00:49:42.290
I dare you try to see me,
try to bring me into focus,

00:49:42.290 --> 00:49:43.920
see me if you can.

00:49:43.920 --> 00:49:47.415
And the interesting thing is
at the beginning you can't.

00:49:47.415 --> 00:49:49.710
You're in that gallery
space, and the pictures all

00:49:49.710 --> 00:49:50.880
look the same.

00:49:50.880 --> 00:49:54.220
You need to change yourself
to bring the work of art

00:49:54.220 --> 00:49:56.250
into focus.

00:49:56.250 --> 00:49:59.280
So I'll conclude with the
thought that, if you like,

00:49:59.280 --> 00:50:02.230
the essential project of
the work of art is to say,

00:50:02.230 --> 00:50:03.910
see me if you can.

00:50:03.910 --> 00:50:07.242
Thank you very much
for your attention.

00:50:07.242 --> 00:50:11.634
[APPLAUSE]

00:50:14.499 --> 00:50:15.915
AUDIENCE: The last
distinction you

00:50:15.915 --> 00:50:21.220
were making between the
level of dance and the level

00:50:21.220 --> 00:50:25.290
choreography, makes me
reminded of an observation

00:50:25.290 --> 00:50:28.380
that sports video games
actually have more in common

00:50:28.380 --> 00:50:30.776
with how sports is
presented on TV than what

00:50:30.776 --> 00:50:33.070
it's like to actually
play the sport.

00:50:33.070 --> 00:50:35.990
So this kind of looping
back phenomenon.

00:50:35.990 --> 00:50:40.640
I'm curious if you see that
as analogous to the experience

00:50:40.640 --> 00:50:47.300
of-- or analogous to like the
user level or the perceiver

00:50:47.300 --> 00:50:49.891
level, versus like the
author or designer level.

00:50:49.891 --> 00:50:51.390
That's something
that, obviously, we

00:50:51.390 --> 00:50:54.310
think about a lot in terms
of this distinction-- users

00:50:54.310 --> 00:50:57.640
and implementers or
creators or authors,

00:50:57.640 --> 00:51:00.540
who are actually
creating the experience.

00:51:00.540 --> 00:51:03.730
And thus, part of what
seems like you're getting at

00:51:03.730 --> 00:51:05.945
is creating the norms
or the conventions

00:51:05.945 --> 00:51:07.445
with which the user
then understands

00:51:07.445 --> 00:51:08.992
the experience their having.

00:51:08.992 --> 00:51:12.180
ALVA NOE: When you're--
I'm not a programmer,

00:51:12.180 --> 00:51:15.800
and I don't really know
the issues that you face.

00:51:15.800 --> 00:51:20.190
But one interesting thing that
I imagine the programmer faces

00:51:20.190 --> 00:51:26.200
is designing environments that
give the user the affordances

00:51:26.200 --> 00:51:29.380
the user needs to know what's
going on or to make sense,

00:51:29.380 --> 00:51:32.030
to find the situation
intelligible.

00:51:32.030 --> 00:51:36.360
So for that reason,
designers are

00:51:36.360 --> 00:51:40.970
going to try to tap into
the habits and knowledge

00:51:40.970 --> 00:51:48.070
and expectations that the user
brings to the task-- point

00:51:48.070 --> 00:51:52.260
and click, for example.

00:51:52.260 --> 00:51:59.990
And then as you're suggesting,
or maybe as we're both

00:51:59.990 --> 00:52:05.030
suggesting in slightly
different words,

00:52:05.030 --> 00:52:09.480
the user is transformed
by their new interface,

00:52:09.480 --> 00:52:17.890
by their new engagement
and acquires new habits,

00:52:17.890 --> 00:52:21.410
which affect how
they think and see

00:52:21.410 --> 00:52:26.174
and respond outside of
the designed environment.

00:52:26.174 --> 00:52:27.090
And that's remarkable.

00:52:27.090 --> 00:52:30.350
I mean, that's real evolution.

00:52:30.350 --> 00:52:33.470
And it's not foreseeable.

00:52:33.470 --> 00:52:35.880
I mean, there's the silly,
stupid examples of it,

00:52:35.880 --> 00:52:39.626
like when I punch my book trying
to get it to turn the page,

00:52:39.626 --> 00:52:41.000
which if you're
tired enough, I'm

00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:44.330
sure you've all done
things like that.

00:52:44.330 --> 00:52:49.460
Or I can think of many,
many examples, where

00:52:49.460 --> 00:52:58.210
the metaphors and models and
paradigms and a virtual space

00:52:58.210 --> 00:53:02.590
misfire when they've taken over
into a non-virtual environment

00:53:02.590 --> 00:53:03.980
and yet they'll do so.

00:53:10.080 --> 00:53:13.200
One of the interesting-- if I
can just free associate for one

00:53:13.200 --> 00:53:15.760
moment, it's interesting to
think about this in relation

00:53:15.760 --> 00:53:18.600
to language.

00:53:18.600 --> 00:53:20.650
One of the big questions
that people have always

00:53:20.650 --> 00:53:23.266
asked about language--
not always asked,

00:53:23.266 --> 00:53:26.320
but I'm thinking of sort of
people in the post Chomskian

00:53:26.320 --> 00:53:28.300
world of linguistics
have asked--

00:53:28.300 --> 00:53:31.820
how is it that we can learn
language as readily as we can,

00:53:31.820 --> 00:53:33.990
given our complexities and
given how little time we

00:53:33.990 --> 00:53:37.135
have to learn it and given how
poor the linguistic samples are

00:53:37.135 --> 00:53:38.960
on the basis of which
we do learn it--

00:53:38.960 --> 00:53:43.610
baby talk and inaccurate speech
as people slur their words when

00:53:43.610 --> 00:53:44.970
they're talking.

00:53:44.970 --> 00:53:49.178
And yet kids get it,
and they get it fast.

00:53:49.178 --> 00:53:51.950
Well, there's an interesting
way of turning that idea around

00:53:51.950 --> 00:53:52.490
on its head.

00:53:52.490 --> 00:53:54.590
This is not an idea
original to me.

00:53:54.590 --> 00:53:56.840
There's an interesting way
of turning that idea around

00:53:56.840 --> 00:53:59.070
on its head, which is
that language, in a way,

00:53:59.070 --> 00:54:00.990
is a user friendly system.

00:54:00.990 --> 00:54:05.660
It's been designed through
thousands of years precisely

00:54:05.660 --> 00:54:08.110
to be learnable by
creatures like us.

00:54:08.110 --> 00:54:11.560
So it's not that
we are so smart.

00:54:11.560 --> 00:54:13.490
It's that the design
process iterated

00:54:13.490 --> 00:54:17.615
over long periods of time has
turned out to be so sufficient.

00:54:20.280 --> 00:54:24.080
And I think something actually
similar-- in the book,

00:54:24.080 --> 00:54:27.320
I hypothesize that something
similar goes on with pictures.

00:54:27.320 --> 00:54:29.350
And pictures are old
world technology,

00:54:29.350 --> 00:54:31.920
30,000-year-old technology.

00:54:31.920 --> 00:54:39.490
But we find pictures
effortless to interpret.

00:54:39.490 --> 00:54:40.840
Actually, that's not quite true.

00:54:40.840 --> 00:54:42.381
We find them effortless
to interpret,

00:54:42.381 --> 00:54:43.910
when they come with a caption.

00:54:43.910 --> 00:54:46.530
You give a picture out of a
context, and all of a sudden,

00:54:46.530 --> 00:54:48.730
all bets are off.

00:54:48.730 --> 00:54:51.290
But with the caption
in the right context,

00:54:51.290 --> 00:54:54.000
we find pictures very,
very straightforward.

00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:57.355
So one question is,
is that-- and I just

00:54:57.355 --> 00:54:59.370
leave this, give this to
you as a question-- is

00:54:59.370 --> 00:55:06.390
that because they tap into
the way we naturally see?

00:55:06.390 --> 00:55:09.100
Or is it that they've
taught how to see

00:55:09.100 --> 00:55:11.420
in the way in which a
virtual environment can teach

00:55:11.420 --> 00:55:15.340
a gamer or a user how to act?

00:55:15.340 --> 00:55:16.930
AUDIENCE: The sort
of reorganization

00:55:16.930 --> 00:55:19.390
that you describe as
occurring through art

00:55:19.390 --> 00:55:23.100
is something that reminds
me of what happens

00:55:23.100 --> 00:55:27.150
with education,
with psychotherapy,

00:55:27.150 --> 00:55:31.880
with other sorts of situations
where you achieve an insight

00:55:31.880 --> 00:55:34.120
and then you have this
nonlinear transition

00:55:34.120 --> 00:55:36.580
in your understanding of things.

00:55:36.580 --> 00:55:39.570
Do you see those as part
of the same category?

00:55:39.570 --> 00:55:42.350
And if so, why did
you pick art as sort

00:55:42.350 --> 00:55:44.520
of the prototypical
example of it.

00:55:44.520 --> 00:55:47.430
ALVA NOE: The
discovery in the book

00:55:47.430 --> 00:55:49.090
is that there's a
phenomenon called

00:55:49.090 --> 00:55:50.335
reorganizational practice.

00:55:53.490 --> 00:55:58.260
And art is one and
so is philosophy.

00:55:58.260 --> 00:56:00.977
And by the way, that's not an
orthodox view in philosophy.

00:56:00.977 --> 00:56:02.560
I mean, there are
people in philosophy

00:56:02.560 --> 00:56:04.010
that would agree with me.

00:56:04.010 --> 00:56:07.240
But many philosophers
think of themselves

00:56:07.240 --> 00:56:11.410
as seeking knowledge or
results or making proofs

00:56:11.410 --> 00:56:15.550
about the nature of mind
and matter and causation.

00:56:15.550 --> 00:56:21.270
The idea that philosophy is
not about discovering truths

00:56:21.270 --> 00:56:26.140
but is about reorganizing
us is a debatable view.

00:56:30.890 --> 00:56:33.490
The argument of the book is
that art and philosophy matter

00:56:33.490 --> 00:56:37.070
to us, because they are
reorganizational practices.

00:56:37.070 --> 00:56:39.610
If the value of philosophy
depended on the truths

00:56:39.610 --> 00:56:41.600
that philosophers had
established and come

00:56:41.600 --> 00:56:44.650
to agree upon, philosophy
would be in trouble.

00:56:44.650 --> 00:56:47.190
But it's not a
problem for philosophy

00:56:47.190 --> 00:56:52.220
that no philosopher agrees
with another philosopher.

00:56:52.220 --> 00:56:53.940
Similarly, it's
no problem for art

00:56:53.940 --> 00:56:59.240
that art doesn't converge
on a single artistic idea.

00:56:59.240 --> 00:57:00.807
So I think that
the idea that art

00:57:00.807 --> 00:57:02.890
is a reorganizational
practice and that philosophy

00:57:02.890 --> 00:57:05.224
are reorganizational
practices help

00:57:05.224 --> 00:57:07.640
us answer the kinds of questions
I asked at the beginning.

00:57:07.640 --> 00:57:08.690
What is art?

00:57:08.690 --> 00:57:10.140
What is philosophy?

00:57:10.140 --> 00:57:11.210
Why do they matter to us?

00:57:11.210 --> 00:57:13.282
What do they teach
us about ourselves?

00:57:13.282 --> 00:57:15.240
Now, you're asking a very
interesting question.

00:57:17.820 --> 00:57:20.370
Are there other
reorganizational practices?

00:57:20.370 --> 00:57:23.715
Is psychotherapy, for
example psychoanalysis,

00:57:23.715 --> 00:57:26.470
a reorganization practice?

00:57:26.470 --> 00:57:28.890
This terminology of
organization reorganization

00:57:28.890 --> 00:57:34.040
is used in a number
of other fields,

00:57:34.040 --> 00:57:36.330
for example, in the
body work field.

00:57:36.330 --> 00:57:38.430
People like Feldenkrais
practitioners

00:57:38.430 --> 00:57:40.900
talk about reorganizing
the body's habits

00:57:40.900 --> 00:57:43.140
to deal with organic
problems that the body faces.

00:57:48.400 --> 00:57:51.650
And I'm open to the
possibility that there

00:57:51.650 --> 00:57:56.825
are other species of the genus
than just art and philosophy.

00:58:00.440 --> 00:58:02.510
So my answer to you,
if that's the question,

00:58:02.510 --> 00:58:08.990
is I didn't mean to suggest
that I'd given evidence

00:58:08.990 --> 00:58:12.410
that only art and philosophy
are reorganizational practices.

00:58:12.410 --> 00:58:14.100
But now there's a
further question,

00:58:14.100 --> 00:58:16.830
which you might be asking.

00:58:16.830 --> 00:58:19.240
What's the principle of
differentiation between them?

00:58:23.300 --> 00:58:24.800
I thought about
that for a long time

00:58:24.800 --> 00:58:27.100
in a slightly different setting.

00:58:30.010 --> 00:58:33.080
Most of the features that
I think define works of art

00:58:33.080 --> 00:58:34.850
are also characteristics
of jokes.

00:58:38.530 --> 00:58:41.549
Jokes are sort of
cognitively rich.

00:58:41.549 --> 00:58:43.090
They involve certain
kinds of shifts.

00:58:45.955 --> 00:58:48.530
They exhibit many of the
hallmarks of works of art.

00:58:52.714 --> 00:58:54.380
I don't know if that's
a problem for me.

00:58:54.380 --> 00:58:59.610
Maybe joke-telling is a
species of art-making.

00:58:59.610 --> 00:59:04.404
But I would-- oh,
there's another way.

00:59:04.404 --> 00:59:06.320
Actually, here's another
point that's related.

00:59:06.320 --> 00:59:08.390
Sorry if my answer is
going on much too long.

00:59:08.390 --> 00:59:10.480
But another point
which is relevant

00:59:10.480 --> 00:59:16.450
is playing the flute
is an art form.

00:59:16.450 --> 00:59:18.970
Dancing hip hop is an art form.

00:59:18.970 --> 00:59:21.180
Potting is an art form.

00:59:21.180 --> 00:59:25.070
Making video installations
is an art form.

00:59:25.070 --> 00:59:27.140
Building buildings
is an art form.

00:59:27.140 --> 00:59:30.700
Those are all totally
different kinds of things.

00:59:30.700 --> 00:59:36.460
So maybe the class of things
that participate-- and I

00:59:36.460 --> 00:59:40.210
want to say that philosophy
belongs on that list-- what

00:59:40.210 --> 00:59:43.890
makes them each
art forms, I think,

00:59:43.890 --> 00:59:46.750
is the way in which
they're performing

00:59:46.750 --> 00:59:51.120
reorganizational work in
different neighborhoods

00:59:51.120 --> 00:59:51.821
of our being.

00:59:55.258 --> 01:00:00.150
And-- and maybe this
is getting closer

01:00:00.150 --> 01:00:04.600
to something that might have
been in the back of your mind--

01:00:04.600 --> 01:00:06.436
and they're doing so
for that reason alone.

01:00:12.600 --> 01:00:15.980
The artist isn't trying to get
a rocket ship to go to the moon

01:00:15.980 --> 01:00:17.130
or to debug a program.

01:00:20.600 --> 01:00:23.980
The artist, if I'm
right, is trying

01:00:23.980 --> 01:00:26.370
to give us
enlightenment, is trying

01:00:26.370 --> 01:00:31.850
to help us understand
ourselves, and in that sense,

01:00:31.850 --> 01:00:35.900
open up the possibility
of changing ourselves.

01:00:35.900 --> 01:00:37.670
Maybe that's a very
good explanation

01:00:37.670 --> 01:00:39.600
of what psychoanalysis
is doing too.

01:00:39.600 --> 01:00:40.560
That's a good question.

01:00:40.560 --> 01:00:43.120
It's an open question to me.

01:00:43.120 --> 01:00:44.020
[APPLAUSE]

01:00:44.020 --> 01:00:45.220
Thank you very much.

01:00:45.220 --> 01:00:47.670
I thank you for your attention.
