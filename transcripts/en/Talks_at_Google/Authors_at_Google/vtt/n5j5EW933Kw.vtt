00:00:08.595 --> 00:00:09.720
MALE SPEAKER: Good morning.

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:13.210
Welcome to Authors at
Google in Cambridge.

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:17.240
Today, it's my great pleasure to
introduce Ha-Joon Chang, author

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.560
of "Economics,
The User's Guide."

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.030
In his bestselling
"23 Things They

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:26.100
Don't Tell You
About Capitalism,"

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:29.670
Dr. Chang, the
Cambridge economist,

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.235
brilliantly debunked many
of the predominant myths

00:00:32.235 --> 00:00:35.810
of neoclassical economics.

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:38.600
Now, in an entertaining
and accessible primer,

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.510
he explains how the
global economy actually

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.330
works in real-world terms.

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:47.750
Writing with irreverent wit,
a deep knowledge of history,

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:51.380
and a disregard for
conventional economic pieties,

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:53.190
he offers insights
that will never

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.690
be found in the textbooks.

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:58.500
Dr. Chang teaches in
the faculty of economics

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.590
at Cambridge University.

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:03.450
His books include the
international bestseller "Bad

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:05.610
Samaritans, The
Myth of Free Trade

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.410
and the Secret History
of Capitalism,"

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:11.830
"Kicking Away the Ladder,"
winner of the 2003 Myrdal

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:14.900
Prize, and again,
"23 Things They

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.250
Don't Tell You
About Capitalism."

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.110
In 2005, he was awarded
the Leontief Prize

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:24.190
for Advancing the Frontiers
of Economic Thought.

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:27.276
Please join me in welcoming
Dr. Ha-Joon Chang.

00:01:27.276 --> 00:01:31.650
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.110
HA-JOON CHANG: Good morning.

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:36.970
My great pleasure to be here.

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:42.240
As a recent recruit to
your Android system,

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.780
I thank you for inventing
a very good one.

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:52.200
Yeah, I went-- I come from
the other Cambridge, which

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.200
is a few hundred
years older than here.

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.090
Yeah, but then there are places
like Oxford, where there's

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:02.800
a college called
New College, which

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.710
was founded in the 15th century.

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:09.840
So yeah, a lot more
advanced than that.

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.430
Today, I want to talk about
this book, "Economics,

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:13.680
The User's Guide."

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:20.954
And the reason why I
got to write this book

00:02:20.954 --> 00:02:26.990
is many people agree that
economics is very important.

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:31.190
Economic events like 2008
financial crisis, or the rise

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:35.600
of China, the invention of the
internet, and so on, I mean,

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:40.681
they seriously affect our
lives for better or worse.

00:02:40.681 --> 00:02:45.350
And how our business
and political leaders

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:47.520
deal with those
changes also affect

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:51.560
how people live, how they
grow old, how they retire,

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.700
and so on.

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:59.310
So everyone agrees that economic
issues are very important.

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:03.680
But when it comes to talking
about those things, when

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.770
it comes to talking about
economics, which is supposed

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:12.640
to tell you how these things
do work and should work,

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:16.120
there's widespread perception
that it is too complicated.

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.600
Economics is too complicated
for non-specialists.

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:23.580
Actually, it's very
interesting because we

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:28.230
have very strong opinions
about all sorts of things, Iraq

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:34.240
War, gay marriage, Afghanistan,
climate change, nuclear power.

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:39.230
I have got strong views
on all those things.

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:41.320
But then are we
actually qualified

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:42.970
to make those judgments?

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:47.100
That the only thing I know
about in terms of politics

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:51.190
is this introduction to
international relations

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:53.960
that I took as an
undergraduate student

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:57.080
back in South Korea in 1983.

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:00.420
And then I'm saying all kinds of
things about US foreign policy,

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:05.870
and the Middle East, and
the role of Britain in that.

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:08.230
So we are not actually
afraid of saying those things

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:10.900
without having the
necessary qualifications.

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:12.640
But when it comes
to economics, people

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:15.230
say, oh, yeah,
that's too difficult.

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:17.120
That's for the experts.

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:18.850
And indeed, the
experts themselves

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:21.450
say, yes, that stuff
is so difficult.

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:23.020
You wouldn't understand
it even if we

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:24.700
tried to explain it to you.

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:26.510
So don't worry.

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:27.870
Everything's under control.

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:28.790
Go away.

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:29.750
Don't look into this.

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:30.250
Yeah?

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:32.900
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:35.310
But why?

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:38.491
Why should economics
be different?

00:04:38.491 --> 00:04:41.550
I mean, it's only because my
professional colleagues have

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:43.770
been fantastically
successful in convincing

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:47.010
the rest of the world that
that stuff is so difficult,

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:55.810
that it's not going to be
understandable to mere mortals.

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:58.530
But I believe, as I
said in my earlier book,

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:02.410
"23 Things They Don't
Tell You Capitalism,"

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:07.810
I believe that 95% of economics
is actually common sense.

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:09.650
Of course, they're
made to look difficult

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:14.030
with the use of mathematics
and graphs and the jargons.

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:17.180
And even the remaining
5%, I would argue,

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:19.260
can be understood
in their essence,

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:25.690
if not in all technical details,
if somebody bothers to explain

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:28.920
them in an accessible
way, which is

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:31.196
what I tried to do in this book.

00:05:31.196 --> 00:05:38.170
Yes, I tried my best
to make it interesting.

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:41.880
So there is "Mary Poppins," "The
Simpsons," well, at least Ned

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:44.920
Flanders, my favorite
"Simpson's" character,

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:46.900
"The Hitchhikers
Guide to the Galaxy,"

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:49.591
"The Matrix," "My Fair
Lady," "Gone With the Wind,"

00:05:49.591 --> 00:05:50.090
and whatnot.

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:54.850
However, being
accessible doesn't

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:57.770
mean that I'm trying to give
you some kind of baby version

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:00.650
or dummy's version
of economics to you.

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:03.890
So when we remember
these 15 things, 7 things

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:05.320
you need to know
about inflation,

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:07.220
or that kind of approach.

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:10.590
I take my readers very seriously
and talk about all kinds

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:12.150
of fundamental things.

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:14.620
So what is economics?

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:16.380
We can talk about
that, but I don't

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:19.900
think we have enough
time to do that.

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:22.080
Whether economics
can be a science,

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:25.690
as some or indeed
many economists claim,

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:28.510
the ethical foundations
of economics, and then we

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:33.080
can separate economics from
politics, different approaches

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:38.610
to understanding the
economy, and so on.

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:42.620
So if I briefly--
this is the cover

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:46.830
of the British edition,
which is same in content

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:48.740
but a different format.

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:52.090
So it's a pocket-sized book.

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:55.650
So if I show you--
ah, yeah, I'm,

00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:58.800
yeah, trying to do something
completely different

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:01.430
from the existing
economics books.

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:05.680
As you can see from
this table of contents,

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:07.590
I mean, you will
find a lot of things

00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:15.570
that you normally do not see
in introductory economics book.

00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:20.770
So the definition of economics,
the history of capitalism,

00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:24.960
different schools of economics,
topics like production

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:29.500
and work, which do not get
talked about very much.

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:31.920
For example, in
standard economics

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:36.500
we are mainly conceptualized
as consumers, yeah?

00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:38.750
So we make consumer
choice, forms

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:43.400
that provide the
products, and so on.

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:47.870
And the form is there but
is seen as a black box,

00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:53.010
as this thing called production
function, which describes

00:07:53.010 --> 00:07:56.880
this relationship between some
abstract concept called capital

00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:57.600
and labor.

00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:01.130
And then there's
really very little

00:08:01.130 --> 00:08:04.270
talk about how to actually
organize production,

00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:07.540
whether for the material
things or immaterial

00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:11.820
things like what you
produce here, and so on.

00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:14.660
So I tried to talk
about these things.

00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:20.400
I'll talk about some of
them in a few minutes,

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:27.080
but let's go through
some of the basic things.

00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:32.100
My book also
introduces the readers

00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:37.690
to what I call
real life numbers.

00:08:37.690 --> 00:08:40.809
People think that economics
is a numbers subject.

00:08:40.809 --> 00:08:45.200
And yes, I mean, if you
look at economic articles,

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:46.480
you see a lot of numbers.

00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:54.380
But these numbers are dealt in
a very kind of abstract way,

00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:55.550
in aggregate ways.

00:08:55.550 --> 00:08:58.730
So it is quite common these
days that people graduate

00:08:58.730 --> 00:09:03.490
with an economics degree without
knowing really much numbers

00:09:03.490 --> 00:09:06.600
about the real economy.

00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:09.190
So economics graduate
would be hard pressed

00:09:09.190 --> 00:09:16.350
to know what the national
income of their country is,

00:09:16.350 --> 00:09:22.140
how big the world economy is,
and what proportion of that

00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:26.720
is produced by the US
or China or Germany.

00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:30.970
Now, [INAUDIBLE] why do you
need to know these numbers?

00:09:30.970 --> 00:09:32.312
Because of you.

00:09:32.312 --> 00:09:36.360
You have created this
amazing search engine

00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:39.950
where you can find anything.

00:09:39.950 --> 00:09:42.740
But even to know
what to look for,

00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:44.660
you need some sense
of these numbers.

00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:47.610
And if you have no
sense of these numbers,

00:09:47.610 --> 00:09:52.010
you can make very
serious misjudgment.

00:09:52.010 --> 00:09:57.750
A great recent example
is the Eurozone crisis.

00:09:57.750 --> 00:10:01.860
So a number of European economy
using the common currency

00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:07.030
euro got into economic
trouble, and especially bad

00:10:07.030 --> 00:10:10.320
was the situation in Greece.

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:13.610
And when the Greek
crisis erupted,

00:10:13.610 --> 00:10:17.110
there was this very
widely-accepted narrative,

00:10:17.110 --> 00:10:19.740
mainly coming out
of Germany, they

00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:23.950
started saying the Greeks are in
trouble because they are lazy.

00:10:23.950 --> 00:10:28.100
Ah yeah, those Mediterranean
types, they always

00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:30.280
eat and drink and dance,
and they don't work,

00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:34.480
and they want to leech on
the hardworking Germans,

00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:37.940
and the Dutch, and
the Finns, and so on.

00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:41.780
But actually, did you
know that the Greeks work

00:10:41.780 --> 00:10:47.100
30% longer than the Germans and
40% longer than the Dutch, who

00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:49.210
happen to be the laziest
people in the world?

00:10:49.210 --> 00:10:53.940
They have the shortest
working hour in the world.

00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:57.760
Once you know that, you
realize that the Greek crisis

00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:01.840
is a crisis of productivity,
not work ethic.

00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:04.210
Greeks actually work very hard.

00:11:04.210 --> 00:11:06.960
It's that the
whole Greek economy

00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:11.860
that has a low productivity,
to address which

00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:15.470
we need to talk about investment
in infrastructure, research

00:11:15.470 --> 00:11:17.490
and development,
things like that.

00:11:17.490 --> 00:11:19.500
The Greek economic
problem is not

00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:22.300
going to be solved by
shouting at the Greeks

00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:23.670
that you have to work harder.

00:11:26.180 --> 00:11:32.690
While talking about
misunderstood numbers,

00:11:32.690 --> 00:11:37.370
in this country
Mexicans are seen

00:11:37.370 --> 00:11:40.840
as the quintessential
lazy Latinos.

00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:42.580
But did you know that
Mexicans actually

00:11:42.580 --> 00:11:44.850
work 25% longer
than the Americans?

00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:48.970
I mean, this is
just one example.

00:11:48.970 --> 00:11:51.140
But if you get
these numbers wrong,

00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:54.360
you can have a pretty
distorted sense

00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:56.680
about the real-world economies.

00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:59.510
And for that reason,
I emphasize that we

00:11:59.510 --> 00:12:05.020
need to know many of
these real-life numbers,

00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:07.090
and I actually
give a lot of them.

00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:14.400
Of course, emphasizing
the importance of numbers

00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:18.110
doesn't mean that you have
to take them too seriously.

00:12:18.110 --> 00:12:23.810
I suggest that numbers have to
be taken with a pinch of salt

00:12:23.810 --> 00:12:27.640
and sometimes with
a bag of salt.

00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:30.000
The German writer,
and apparently he

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.080
was also a scientist writing
books on the theory of color

00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:39.370
and things like that, Johann
Wolfgang von Goethe once said,

00:12:39.370 --> 00:12:44.150
"Everything factual
is already a theory."

00:12:44.150 --> 00:12:48.210
Economic numbers, I mean,
same with other numbers,

00:12:48.210 --> 00:12:51.890
but economic numbers
are constructed

00:12:51.890 --> 00:12:55.000
on particular
theoretical assumptions.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.270
So take the case of GDP,
our Gross Domestic Product,

00:12:58.270 --> 00:13:02.640
which is a way of measuring what
an economy produces in a given

00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:05.270
period.

00:13:05.270 --> 00:13:11.570
This number doesn't include
unpaid household work and care

00:13:11.570 --> 00:13:12.900
work that people do at home.

00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:19.640
Well, one standard
justification is, oh, you know,

00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:21.230
they are not marketed.

00:13:21.230 --> 00:13:27.390
It's very difficult to
calculate their economic value.

00:13:27.390 --> 00:13:29.350
But this is not true.

00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:34.170
In constructing the GDP data,
the national statisticians

00:13:34.170 --> 00:13:40.300
go at a great length to impute--
that's the technical term--

00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:44.820
impute the market value
to services and goods that

00:13:44.820 --> 00:13:46.780
are transacted in the markets.

00:13:46.780 --> 00:13:50.490
So for example, if you own
a house and live in there,

00:13:50.490 --> 00:13:55.030
they actually try
to estimate the rent

00:13:55.030 --> 00:13:56.590
that you would
have paid yourself

00:13:56.590 --> 00:13:59.100
if you are renting
it from yourself.

00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:01.850
So when you are even trying
to include those things,

00:14:01.850 --> 00:14:05.240
why do we not include
household work

00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:10.140
and care work, which then
leads to gross underestimation

00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:15.250
of women's contribution
to the economy,

00:14:15.250 --> 00:14:18.370
because most of this
work is done by women?

00:14:18.370 --> 00:14:24.400
And in the standard
estimate that this kind

00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:29.350
of ignored contribution
is estimated

00:14:29.350 --> 00:14:36.835
to be around 30% of national
output in any country.

00:14:36.835 --> 00:14:37.710
Unemployment numbers.

00:14:40.730 --> 00:14:45.630
Well, if you want to be
counted as unemployed,

00:14:45.630 --> 00:14:47.360
you should be willing to work.

00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:50.300
Not everyone who is not
working is willing to work.

00:14:50.300 --> 00:14:53.490
One example is students.

00:14:53.490 --> 00:14:56.280
They want to get education.

00:14:56.280 --> 00:14:57.620
They do not want to work.

00:14:57.620 --> 00:15:00.090
So even if they are
not working, they

00:15:00.090 --> 00:15:01.820
are not counted as unemployed.

00:15:01.820 --> 00:15:06.410
They are counted as people
who are not participating

00:15:06.410 --> 00:15:09.130
in the economy, not active
in the labor market.

00:15:09.130 --> 00:15:11.450
There are people
who might stay home

00:15:11.450 --> 00:15:13.445
but who take care
of children who

00:15:13.445 --> 00:15:14.955
are not seeking paid employment.

00:15:18.750 --> 00:15:24.570
So that you aren't counting only
people who are willing to work

00:15:24.570 --> 00:15:28.780
and do not have a job
when you are counting

00:15:28.780 --> 00:15:32.730
the number of people
who are unemployed.

00:15:32.730 --> 00:15:36.760
But how do you know whether
this person is willing to work

00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:38.860
or not?

00:15:38.860 --> 00:15:41.290
You don't just ask them,
are you willing to work?

00:15:41.290 --> 00:15:44.510
You have to prove that you
are willing to work, which

00:15:44.510 --> 00:15:52.640
in standard methodology is done
by showing that I have actually

00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:56.230
applied for paid employment
within the last four weeks.

00:15:59.090 --> 00:16:04.320
In normal times, this is not
an unreasonable approach.

00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:07.600
But in difficult economic
times, like we have been through

00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:10.120
in the last several
years, there are

00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:14.420
a lot of people who are known
as, technically, discouraged

00:16:14.420 --> 00:16:16.260
workers.

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:20.250
These are people who have
applied for 100 jobs, 150 jobs,

00:16:20.250 --> 00:16:23.510
got rejected over and
over and over again,

00:16:23.510 --> 00:16:25.380
and they just give up.

00:16:25.380 --> 00:16:28.840
So when the statisticians that
[INAUDIBLE] come and ask them,

00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:31.930
have you applied for a paid
job in the last four weeks,

00:16:31.930 --> 00:16:33.390
they say no.

00:16:33.390 --> 00:16:38.200
But that doesn't mean that
they are willingly unemployed.

00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:41.940
Anyway, you can debate
all these numbers,

00:16:41.940 --> 00:16:45.210
but the point I'm
trying to say here

00:16:45.210 --> 00:16:47.620
is that all these
numbers are based

00:16:47.620 --> 00:16:50.810
on particular assumptions,
and you can't take them

00:16:50.810 --> 00:16:53.560
in the way you take, I
don't know, the temperature

00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:56.160
of water or weight of
an elephant and so on.

00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:59.370
Although if you ask
a scientist, they'll

00:16:59.370 --> 00:17:01.030
say even those numbers
can be debated.

00:17:05.329 --> 00:17:07.650
Now, talking of
science, many economists

00:17:07.650 --> 00:17:09.410
will try to tell
you that economics

00:17:09.410 --> 00:17:12.490
is a science in which
there's one right theory,

00:17:12.490 --> 00:17:15.310
or at least one best theory.

00:17:15.310 --> 00:17:17.859
But in this book, I
devote one long chapter

00:17:17.859 --> 00:17:20.940
to explain that there are at
least nine different schools

00:17:20.940 --> 00:17:25.085
of economics, each with its own
unique strength and weaknesses.

00:17:28.050 --> 00:17:30.470
And for free market
economics alone, there

00:17:30.470 --> 00:17:32.440
are three different varieties.

00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:36.680
One is classical
economics of Adam Smith

00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:40.510
and David Ricardo,
neoclassical, which

00:17:40.510 --> 00:17:44.890
is the dominant school of
economics today, and Austrian.

00:17:44.890 --> 00:17:50.790
This is represented by the,
well, Austrian economist

00:17:50.790 --> 00:17:53.834
Friedrich von Hayek.

00:17:53.834 --> 00:17:56.250
I mean, this school
is sometimes known

00:17:56.250 --> 00:17:58.690
as libertarian in
the United States.

00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:06.250
Well, the complication is
the neoclassical economics

00:18:06.250 --> 00:18:08.925
isn't the same as
free market economics.

00:18:08.925 --> 00:18:11.180
Some neoclassical
economists, like Paul Krugman

00:18:11.180 --> 00:18:14.520
and Joe Stiglitz, they are
not free market economists.

00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:18.520
I mean, we can talk about
that if you are interested.

00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:20.950
But the majority of
neoclassical economists

00:18:20.950 --> 00:18:23.880
these days advocate
free market policy,

00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:28.020
but the way they advocate
free market is all different.

00:18:31.190 --> 00:18:33.740
So the classical
economists, they

00:18:33.740 --> 00:18:35.700
do not talk about
the individuals.

00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:39.150
They do not really
talk about consumers

00:18:39.150 --> 00:18:42.790
because their analysis is
based on class analysis.

00:18:42.790 --> 00:18:46.110
Their theory is that there are
three classes, capitalists,

00:18:46.110 --> 00:18:47.630
workers, and landlord.

00:18:47.630 --> 00:18:51.340
And the best way to
maximize national output is

00:18:51.340 --> 00:18:55.460
to give the maximum amount of
surplus to the capitalists,

00:18:55.460 --> 00:18:59.240
will invest and generate
growth and jobs.

00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:01.130
And in order to achieve
that, the best way

00:19:01.130 --> 00:19:04.570
is to leave it to the market.

00:19:04.570 --> 00:19:09.731
Neoclassical economics doesn't
have the notion of class.

00:19:09.731 --> 00:19:11.480
Actually, a lot of
neoclassical economists

00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:16.210
will say, well, class is
wrong analytical category.

00:19:16.210 --> 00:19:17.580
We are all individuals.

00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:25.280
There is no such super
individual thing like class.

00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:28.820
The Austrians also have
a very different defense

00:19:28.820 --> 00:19:31.030
of the free market.

00:19:31.030 --> 00:19:33.990
To simplify it, the neoclassical
defense of free market

00:19:33.990 --> 00:19:37.150
is that everyone knows
what he or she is

00:19:37.150 --> 00:19:41.190
doing, so leave people alone.

00:19:41.190 --> 00:19:44.700
The Austrian defense is no one
really knows what's going on,

00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:46.920
so how dare the
government thinks

00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:48.950
that it can tell
people what to do.

00:19:48.950 --> 00:19:51.780
These are quite different
views of the world.

00:19:51.780 --> 00:19:54.100
Because the Austrian
views that the world

00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:55.920
is full of uncertainty.

00:19:55.920 --> 00:20:04.420
Our rationale is limited, and
therefore there cannot be some

00:20:04.420 --> 00:20:10.920
centrally planned or at least
centrally-directed policy.

00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:14.562
The neoclassical view is that
the world is very certain.

00:20:14.562 --> 00:20:15.395
People are rational.

00:20:15.395 --> 00:20:17.870
They know what they
are doing, so why

00:20:17.870 --> 00:20:19.890
should government
meddle with it?

00:20:24.282 --> 00:20:27.090
Yeah, so there are all
these different ways

00:20:27.090 --> 00:20:30.170
of conceptualizing the economy.

00:20:30.170 --> 00:20:34.890
And if you know that there
are three different ways

00:20:34.890 --> 00:20:36.425
of defending the
free market, you

00:20:36.425 --> 00:20:39.340
know that this is not a science
like physics or chemistry.

00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:50.220
But I give you these different
schools not to create division,

00:20:50.220 --> 00:20:55.940
not to create
factional fighting.

00:20:55.940 --> 00:20:59.550
Because my view is that all
these diverse approaches

00:20:59.550 --> 00:21:02.490
to economics is
necessary in order

00:21:02.490 --> 00:21:06.530
to explain the complexity
of real-world economics.

00:21:06.530 --> 00:21:11.170
And to illustrate this
point, I give you what I call

00:21:11.170 --> 00:21:13.370
"The Singapore
Problem," or "life

00:21:13.370 --> 00:21:15.730
is stranger than fiction."

00:21:15.730 --> 00:21:20.240
Now, if you read standard
things about Singapore

00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:22.880
in, I don't know, the
"Wall Street Journal,"

00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:28.480
the "Economist" magazine,
standard economics textbooks,

00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:31.670
they don't need to tell
you about its free trade

00:21:31.670 --> 00:21:34.350
policy and its
welcoming attitude

00:21:34.350 --> 00:21:38.160
towards foreign
investors, which it has.

00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:44.460
But you will never be told
that 90% of land in Singapore

00:21:44.460 --> 00:21:48.290
is owned by the government,
and 85% of housing

00:21:48.290 --> 00:21:52.040
is provided by government-owned
housing corporation,

00:21:52.040 --> 00:21:56.260
and a staggering 22%
of GDP is produced

00:21:56.260 --> 00:22:01.058
by state-owned enterprises
including Singapore Airlines.

00:22:01.058 --> 00:22:03.200
So I put it to my
students, look,

00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:05.610
give me one economic
theory-- it doesn't matter

00:22:05.610 --> 00:22:09.410
what it is, neoclassical,
Austrian, Marxist, Keynesian--

00:22:09.410 --> 00:22:11.500
one economic theory
that can single-handedly

00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:12.335
explain Singapore.

00:22:15.290 --> 00:22:18.720
Well, they can't because
there is no such theory.

00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:23.040
Singapore combines the
features of extreme free market

00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:26.670
capitalism and
socialism, and where

00:22:26.670 --> 00:22:31.730
is a theory that can
reconcile these two?

00:22:31.730 --> 00:22:35.910
So in the book, I argue that we
should let a "hundred flowers

00:22:35.910 --> 00:22:40.040
bloom," as Chairman
Mao Zedong once said.

00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:42.600
And of course, he said
it with ulterior motive.

00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:44.670
He wanted everyone
to speak their mind,

00:22:44.670 --> 00:22:48.704
and then get rid of
people he didn't like.

00:22:48.704 --> 00:22:49.870
I don't have such intention.

00:22:49.870 --> 00:22:51.210
I don't have such power.

00:22:51.210 --> 00:22:53.980
So this is a genuine plea.

00:22:53.980 --> 00:22:58.110
Well, moreover, I argue that we
should let them cross-fertilize

00:22:58.110 --> 00:23:00.820
because different
approaches to economics

00:23:00.820 --> 00:23:04.860
can actually benefit a lot
from learning from each other,

00:23:04.860 --> 00:23:08.400
making our understanding of
the economic world richer.

00:23:14.190 --> 00:23:18.390
And my advice to the
reader is that they

00:23:18.390 --> 00:23:22.350
should try not to be a man
or a woman with a hammer.

00:23:22.350 --> 00:23:25.160
There's this famous saying
sometimes attributed

00:23:25.160 --> 00:23:27.810
to Mark Twain that,
"He who has a hammer

00:23:27.810 --> 00:23:30.696
sees everything as a nail."

00:23:30.696 --> 00:23:33.600
Yeah, so if you
acquire one theory,

00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:36.560
you keep applying
it to everything.

00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:39.090
So if you acquire a hammer,
you keep banging things.

00:23:39.090 --> 00:23:42.430
I mean, it's great
if it's a nail.

00:23:42.430 --> 00:23:45.040
It would just about
work if it's a screw.

00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:49.720
But it would be a
disaster if it is the egg.

00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:53.990
And it would be totally
ineffectual if it's jelly.

00:23:53.990 --> 00:23:57.560
So we need a Swiss army
knife approach, yeah?

00:23:57.560 --> 00:24:02.410
We need a range of tools, and
of course, the sense with which

00:24:02.410 --> 00:24:08.140
to decide what tool to apply to
what problem, which is provided

00:24:08.140 --> 00:24:12.580
by our knowledge of history,
politics, and ethics,

00:24:12.580 --> 00:24:14.110
and so on.

00:24:14.110 --> 00:24:19.000
And this is what we need
because, unfortunately,

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:23.340
economists have become the
proverbial man with the hammer.

00:24:23.340 --> 00:24:26.870
I mean, they have
only one theory

00:24:26.870 --> 00:24:29.650
that they try to
apply everywhere.

00:24:29.650 --> 00:24:32.180
We've seen what
kind of mess that it

00:24:32.180 --> 00:24:35.210
can create in the
last several years.

00:24:38.260 --> 00:24:40.290
Now, as I said
earlier, my book deals

00:24:40.290 --> 00:24:42.920
with a number of topics
that are not usually

00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:46.310
discussed in economics
books these days.

00:24:46.310 --> 00:24:48.540
So I mentioned
production and work.

00:24:48.540 --> 00:24:53.650
Let me elaborate on
only one of them, work.

00:24:53.650 --> 00:24:58.710
Most people of working
age spend at least half

00:24:58.710 --> 00:25:03.160
their waking hours at work.

00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:06.670
And for white-collar
workers like you and me,

00:25:06.670 --> 00:25:10.080
the boundary between
work and personal life

00:25:10.080 --> 00:25:15.510
has been blurred because of
the internet, the mobile phone,

00:25:15.510 --> 00:25:17.770
what have you.

00:25:17.770 --> 00:25:21.530
And if you begin to count
the commuting hours,

00:25:21.530 --> 00:25:26.120
some people are spending
basically 2/3 of their lives

00:25:26.120 --> 00:25:27.780
for working.

00:25:27.780 --> 00:25:31.060
In South Africa under
the apartheid regime,

00:25:31.060 --> 00:25:33.440
they built these
so-called townships

00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:37.100
for black people,
which are built

00:25:37.100 --> 00:25:42.100
in a far-flung place from
the nice, white cities.

00:25:42.100 --> 00:25:44.790
And apartheid
regime didn't really

00:25:44.790 --> 00:25:48.810
provide any public transport
for these townships.

00:25:48.810 --> 00:25:50.660
Even after the end
of the apartheid,

00:25:50.660 --> 00:25:52.590
the South African
government haven't

00:25:52.590 --> 00:25:56.820
invested enough to
solve this problem.

00:25:56.820 --> 00:26:01.540
So people in some
of these townships

00:26:01.540 --> 00:26:06.320
have to rely on these
strange things known

00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:10.290
as taxis in the country,
which are basically minibuses

00:26:10.290 --> 00:26:13.490
run by organized crime gangs.

00:26:13.490 --> 00:26:15.480
So they charge an arm
and a leg, and they

00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:21.910
have to travel in very bad or
sometimes non-existent road.

00:26:21.910 --> 00:26:27.500
For some people, one-way
commute takes three hours.

00:26:27.500 --> 00:26:29.100
So it's six hours both ways.

00:26:29.100 --> 00:26:32.820
Even if they work only
eight hours, which

00:26:32.820 --> 00:26:38.260
few of these people do, you
are spending 14 hours just

00:26:38.260 --> 00:26:41.310
going to work, working,
coming back a day.

00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:51.370
Despite the fact that work
takes up so much of our lives,

00:26:51.370 --> 00:26:54.720
there's really little discussion
of work in economics books

00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:56.170
these days.

00:26:56.170 --> 00:26:58.530
Work is, in a way,
discussed only

00:26:58.530 --> 00:27:02.520
when it's absent, when
there is an unemployment.

00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:07.410
The work itself
is not discussed,

00:27:07.410 --> 00:27:10.170
and this is because people
are mainly conceptualized

00:27:10.170 --> 00:27:11.890
as consumers, as I
mentioned earlier,

00:27:11.890 --> 00:27:14.460
in relation to production.

00:27:14.460 --> 00:27:16.360
Because in the standard
economic theory,

00:27:16.360 --> 00:27:18.690
neoclassical
economic theory, work

00:27:18.690 --> 00:27:21.480
is seen as disutility
that people

00:27:21.480 --> 00:27:24.370
have to put up with so that
they can earn something

00:27:24.370 --> 00:27:29.570
income with which to buy things,
goods and services, whose

00:27:29.570 --> 00:27:33.020
consumption gives the utility,
their ultimate pleasure

00:27:33.020 --> 00:27:34.660
in life.

00:27:34.660 --> 00:27:36.250
The work is only a means.

00:27:36.250 --> 00:27:40.610
But we know that what happens
in the workplace tremendously

00:27:40.610 --> 00:27:42.270
affects us.

00:27:42.270 --> 00:27:43.430
Work can be interesting.

00:27:43.430 --> 00:27:47.310
I hope that at least
most people in this room

00:27:47.310 --> 00:27:50.020
think that their
work is interesting.

00:27:50.020 --> 00:27:51.760
Can be deathly boring.

00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:59.000
I mean, you've seen Charlie
Chaplin in "Modern Times."

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:07.760
I mean, it can really affect
your psychological well-being

00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:13.880
because a lot of companies have
introduced this performance

00:28:13.880 --> 00:28:16.690
monitoring regime, which
really drive people hard,

00:28:16.690 --> 00:28:21.190
or they have reduced
job security, and so on.

00:28:21.190 --> 00:28:28.945
And ultimately, work can
also affect our identity

00:28:28.945 --> 00:28:29.820
and self-fulfillment.

00:28:34.570 --> 00:28:38.380
Despite that, we
don't talk about work.

00:28:38.380 --> 00:28:42.200
So government
policies and economics

00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:45.590
advises that
economies [INAUDIBLE]

00:28:45.590 --> 00:28:47.410
all gear towards income.

00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:54.520
So a lot of people in the rich
countries over the last 20

00:28:54.520 --> 00:28:58.160
years have become
richer, but many of them

00:28:58.160 --> 00:29:00.510
are feeling less happy
because their work has

00:29:00.510 --> 00:29:02.360
become more stressful.

00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:03.985
The work intensity
has increased,

00:29:03.985 --> 00:29:07.190
the commute has become
longer, that there

00:29:07.190 --> 00:29:09.470
is less job security.

00:29:09.470 --> 00:29:11.890
But then these people are
told, oh, you should be happy.

00:29:11.890 --> 00:29:16.970
Your monetary economy
is 20% higher.

00:29:16.970 --> 00:29:18.730
But should they?

00:29:18.730 --> 00:29:21.090
Well, we need to discuss
these things at least.

00:29:28.780 --> 00:29:30.970
Throughout the book, I
emphasize that economics

00:29:30.970 --> 00:29:33.610
is a political subject.

00:29:33.610 --> 00:29:35.570
It's not a science.

00:29:35.570 --> 00:29:38.910
Of course, many economists,
neoclassical economists,

00:29:38.910 --> 00:29:41.570
will try to tell you
that what they do

00:29:41.570 --> 00:29:45.390
is a value-free science.

00:29:45.390 --> 00:29:47.960
But economics can
not be separated

00:29:47.960 --> 00:29:49.960
from politics in the end.

00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:52.730
Actually, very interesting,
all the name for economics

00:29:52.730 --> 00:29:54.910
was political economy.

00:29:54.910 --> 00:29:59.550
There's an explicit recognition
that politics and economics

00:29:59.550 --> 00:30:02.370
are inseparable.

00:30:02.370 --> 00:30:04.010
The neoclassical
school, which came

00:30:04.010 --> 00:30:08.020
into being in the late 19th
century, didn't like that.

00:30:08.020 --> 00:30:10.300
They wanted to make
economics science.

00:30:10.300 --> 00:30:21.000
So they tried their best to
rid economics of politics.

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:25.420
So they renamed the subject from
political economy to economics.

00:30:25.420 --> 00:30:31.940
They introduced this
ethical criteria, which

00:30:31.940 --> 00:30:37.790
they think is apolitical,
known as the Pareto criterion.

00:30:37.790 --> 00:30:41.670
This is named after
half-Italian, half-French

00:30:41.670 --> 00:30:47.245
economist in Switzerland
in the late 19th century

00:30:47.245 --> 00:30:51.210
and early 20th century
called Vilfredo Pareto.

00:30:51.210 --> 00:30:56.120
And Pareto argued that we
should call a social change

00:30:56.120 --> 00:31:00.820
an improvement only when it
makes at least some people

00:31:00.820 --> 00:31:06.630
better, but makes
no one worse off.

00:31:06.630 --> 00:31:09.940
And this actually is a
very important principle

00:31:09.940 --> 00:31:12.710
because it's a
defense of individuals

00:31:12.710 --> 00:31:16.040
against the tyranny
of the majority.

00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:18.550
So to explain this-- I
don't do this in the book--

00:31:18.550 --> 00:31:30.300
I often use this story that I
call the one-finger example.

00:31:30.300 --> 00:31:33.930
Suppose there's someone knocks
on my door tomorrow and says,

00:31:33.930 --> 00:31:37.760
oh, Dr. Chang, we've invented
this wonderful technology

00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:40.980
that will solve the
global climate change

00:31:40.980 --> 00:31:43.665
problem overnight.

00:31:43.665 --> 00:31:45.410
The machines are built.

00:31:45.410 --> 00:31:46.950
It's ready to go.

00:31:46.950 --> 00:31:52.320
We only need one tiny
input, which you, we hope,

00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:53.320
can provide.

00:31:53.320 --> 00:31:54.520
And I said, what is it?

00:31:57.110 --> 00:32:00.960
He says, well, we need
one live human finger

00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:03.042
to start the machine.

00:32:03.042 --> 00:32:05.680
Yeah, I'll gladly walk into my
kitchen, chop off my finger,

00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:08.060
and give it to him.

00:32:08.060 --> 00:32:10.810
But what if it's one arm?

00:32:10.810 --> 00:32:12.270
I think I'll do it.

00:32:12.270 --> 00:32:13.820
But what if it's my life?

00:32:13.820 --> 00:32:16.565
What if it's the life
of all my family?

00:32:16.565 --> 00:32:20.150
What if it's the life of
all 50 million Koreans?

00:32:20.150 --> 00:32:21.940
Where do you stop?

00:32:21.940 --> 00:32:25.260
So Pareto was terribly
concerned about this and said,

00:32:25.260 --> 00:32:28.330
look, we can't say
you have to sacrifice

00:32:28.330 --> 00:32:32.060
some people for
the greater good.

00:32:32.060 --> 00:32:34.070
So this is a very
important principle.

00:32:34.070 --> 00:32:36.290
However, it still is
our political position

00:32:36.290 --> 00:32:42.740
because the converse of this
position is that you cannot

00:32:42.740 --> 00:32:46.640
make a social change that
will improve the lives of many

00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:49.620
people if one person objects.

00:32:49.620 --> 00:32:54.150
And suppose there's a country
with one very rich guy,

00:32:54.150 --> 00:32:58.600
and you try to
introduce some welfare

00:32:58.600 --> 00:33:00.470
program for poor people.

00:33:00.470 --> 00:33:03.110
This guy can say no,
and there's no way

00:33:03.110 --> 00:33:09.150
you can make this guy do it
on the basis of the Pareto

00:33:09.150 --> 00:33:10.880
criterion.

00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:13.100
I'm not saying
that this is easy.

00:33:13.100 --> 00:33:16.195
It's a terrible dilemma.

00:33:16.195 --> 00:33:16.820
What do you do?

00:33:16.820 --> 00:33:21.850
I mean, do you force that
one person to give up

00:33:21.850 --> 00:33:24.752
a lot of things for
the greater majority?

00:33:24.752 --> 00:33:25.460
Maybe you should.

00:33:25.460 --> 00:33:27.860
But then how about 10 people?

00:33:27.860 --> 00:33:29.070
How about 100 people?

00:33:29.070 --> 00:33:33.150
How about a whole group
of people, and so on?

00:33:33.150 --> 00:33:36.300
So it is a terribly
difficult issue.

00:33:36.300 --> 00:33:43.110
But what I'm trying to say is
that you cannot rid economics

00:33:43.110 --> 00:33:45.800
of politics.

00:33:45.800 --> 00:33:50.190
Actually, the political nature
of economics goes even deeper.

00:33:50.190 --> 00:33:53.180
In my earlier book, "23
Things They Don't Tell You

00:33:53.180 --> 00:33:57.880
About Capitalism," I
have this chapter, well,

00:33:57.880 --> 00:34:00.160
the first chapter,
titled, "There's

00:34:00.160 --> 00:34:02.560
No Such Thing as a Free Market."

00:34:02.560 --> 00:34:05.650
The point I tried
to make there is

00:34:05.650 --> 00:34:08.270
that there is no
objective, scientific way

00:34:08.270 --> 00:34:12.720
to draw the boundary
around the market.

00:34:12.720 --> 00:34:13.219
Yeah.

00:34:13.219 --> 00:34:18.500
So 200 years ago, in
this country and lots

00:34:18.500 --> 00:34:20.260
of other countries,
it was perfectly

00:34:20.260 --> 00:34:23.380
normal to buy and sell people.

00:34:23.380 --> 00:34:25.130
Child labor was
considered normal.

00:34:30.100 --> 00:34:33.770
Today, I haven't met any
free market economists

00:34:33.770 --> 00:34:37.520
who say that we need to bring
back child labor to truly make

00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:41.100
our economy a free
market economy.

00:34:41.100 --> 00:34:43.777
Well, there is one person
who almost said that,

00:34:43.777 --> 00:34:45.110
although he is not an economist.

00:34:45.110 --> 00:34:45.994
Newt Gingrich, yeah?

00:34:45.994 --> 00:34:46.577
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:34:46.577 --> 00:34:47.524
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:47.524 --> 00:34:48.940
HA-JOON CHANG: You
know the story.

00:34:48.940 --> 00:34:51.229
He said poor
children should work

00:34:51.229 --> 00:34:52.719
as janitors in their school.

00:34:52.719 --> 00:34:56.610
But other than him, I haven't
met any advocate of free market

00:34:56.610 --> 00:34:59.290
who want to bring
back child labor.

00:34:59.290 --> 00:35:03.410
But in the 19th century
when social reformers wanted

00:35:03.410 --> 00:35:06.420
to regulate child labor,
many free market economists

00:35:06.420 --> 00:35:08.890
were up in arms.

00:35:08.890 --> 00:35:11.570
They said, this is undermining
the very foundation

00:35:11.570 --> 00:35:16.710
of a free market economy,
namely the freedom of contract.

00:35:16.710 --> 00:35:18.640
These children want to work.

00:35:18.640 --> 00:35:20.050
These people want
to employ them.

00:35:20.050 --> 00:35:22.037
What is your problem?

00:35:22.037 --> 00:35:24.370
It's not like that these
people kidnapped these children

00:35:24.370 --> 00:35:27.415
and used them as slave laborers.

00:35:27.415 --> 00:35:31.220
Yeah, so if you take
the ethical position

00:35:31.220 --> 00:35:35.540
there's nothing wrong with child
labor, well, a lot of people

00:35:35.540 --> 00:35:37.670
have come to accept that,
no, actually children

00:35:37.670 --> 00:35:39.160
need childhood.

00:35:39.160 --> 00:35:42.500
They have the
right to education.

00:35:42.500 --> 00:35:45.920
They need protection
up to a certain age.

00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:48.730
Once you accept that,
it is inconceivable

00:35:48.730 --> 00:35:53.330
that we are debating whether to
relax our regulation on child

00:35:53.330 --> 00:35:56.319
labor so that we can become an
even more free market economy.

00:36:01.010 --> 00:36:03.720
So economics is a fundamentally
political subject,

00:36:03.720 --> 00:36:06.650
the one that any economist will
tell you that it is a science.

00:36:10.130 --> 00:36:12.905
But finally, my book is
not just an explanation

00:36:12.905 --> 00:36:13.780
of economic theories.

00:36:13.780 --> 00:36:16.610
In fact, it's also
about the role

00:36:16.610 --> 00:36:19.910
of economics in public life.

00:36:19.910 --> 00:36:25.090
And in this regard, I have three
sets of observations to make.

00:36:25.090 --> 00:36:29.040
So the first one is,
never trust an economist,

00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:31.666
and that includes me.

00:36:31.666 --> 00:36:36.430
Yeah, of course, that
creates the kind of paradox

00:36:36.430 --> 00:36:40.070
that the Greek
philosophers used to love.

00:36:40.070 --> 00:36:42.200
So if you don't
trust any economists,

00:36:42.200 --> 00:36:44.910
how do you trust
this guy who says

00:36:44.910 --> 00:36:46.505
don't trust any economists?

00:36:46.505 --> 00:36:47.610
I'm not a philosopher.

00:36:47.610 --> 00:36:49.640
I'm not going to
bother with that.

00:36:49.640 --> 00:36:53.060
This is my advice.

00:36:53.060 --> 00:36:56.820
Professional economists do not
have a monopoly over truth,

00:36:56.820 --> 00:37:00.190
and it is entirely
possible for people

00:37:00.190 --> 00:37:02.420
who are not professional
economists to have

00:37:02.420 --> 00:37:05.310
sound judgments on
economic issues.

00:37:05.310 --> 00:37:07.640
And sometimes
judgments might even

00:37:07.640 --> 00:37:12.200
be better because they may
be more rooted in reality

00:37:12.200 --> 00:37:15.820
and less narrowly focused.

00:37:15.820 --> 00:37:18.150
Indeed, I would argue
that the willingness

00:37:18.150 --> 00:37:21.000
on the part of ordinary
citizens to challenge profession

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:25.097
economists and other experts
is a foundation of democracy.

00:37:25.097 --> 00:37:25.930
Just think about it.

00:37:25.930 --> 00:37:28.380
If all you have to
do is to entrust it

00:37:28.380 --> 00:37:34.370
to the professionals, what's
the point of having democracy?

00:37:34.370 --> 00:37:37.880
Yeah, let economists
run economic policy.

00:37:37.880 --> 00:37:42.990
Let the international relations
scholars run foreign policy.

00:37:42.990 --> 00:37:45.450
Let philosophers
run, I don't know,

00:37:45.450 --> 00:37:49.070
your policies on
religion and marriage.

00:37:49.070 --> 00:37:53.020
And the rest of the population
don't need to bother.

00:37:53.020 --> 00:37:54.500
Well, some people think that.

00:37:54.500 --> 00:37:56.400
But I think that
that's a terrible idea

00:37:56.400 --> 00:37:59.540
because then there's no
point in having democracy.

00:38:02.070 --> 00:38:06.520
I also argue that--
well, I'm not even

00:38:06.520 --> 00:38:08.800
trying to pretend
that I can read Latin.

00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:12.570
I mean, apparently
this is a passage

00:38:12.570 --> 00:38:15.640
written on the walls of
the city halls of Gouda,

00:38:15.640 --> 00:38:18.290
the town famous for its cheese.

00:38:18.290 --> 00:38:22.615
I don't know how they invented
this thing in the middle of all

00:38:22.615 --> 00:38:24.780
the cheese making, but they did.

00:38:24.780 --> 00:38:28.082
And I think that
this is the thing

00:38:28.082 --> 00:38:29.540
we have to bear in
mind when you're

00:38:29.540 --> 00:38:36.600
having this debate about
economic issues, which, I mean,

00:38:36.600 --> 00:38:41.860
inevitably involve political
and ethical judgments.

00:38:41.860 --> 00:38:43.480
Now, I'm not saying
that we should not

00:38:43.480 --> 00:38:46.792
have a strong
opinion of our own.

00:38:46.792 --> 00:38:49.100
I mean, we should.

00:38:49.100 --> 00:38:50.790
But given the
complexity of the world

00:38:50.790 --> 00:38:53.130
and given the necessarily
partial nature

00:38:53.130 --> 00:38:55.740
of all economic
theories, we should

00:38:55.740 --> 00:38:59.980
be humble about the validity
of our favorite theory

00:38:59.980 --> 00:39:01.900
and should keep an
open mind about it.

00:39:04.430 --> 00:39:06.180
And finally,
throughout the book,

00:39:06.180 --> 00:39:09.595
even while I constantly
make reform proposals,

00:39:09.595 --> 00:39:14.760
I emphasize how difficult it is
to change the economy reality.

00:39:14.760 --> 00:39:18.180
Sometimes the difficulty is
due to the active attempts

00:39:18.180 --> 00:39:22.230
by those who benefit from
the current arrangements who

00:39:22.230 --> 00:39:24.850
want to defend their positions.

00:39:24.850 --> 00:39:28.110
Bribing, lobbying, media
propaganda, and even violence

00:39:28.110 --> 00:39:30.200
are used.

00:39:30.200 --> 00:39:33.290
But the status quo
often gets defended even

00:39:33.290 --> 00:39:36.420
without some people
actively being evil.

00:39:36.420 --> 00:39:41.980
You don't need Dr. Evil to
have the world that is evil

00:39:41.980 --> 00:39:44.860
because the one dollar,
one vote rule of the market

00:39:44.860 --> 00:39:47.780
drastically constrains the
ability of those with less

00:39:47.780 --> 00:39:52.370
money to refuse undesirable
options given to them.

00:39:52.370 --> 00:39:56.090
So poor workers choose to
work in a dangerous factory.

00:39:56.090 --> 00:39:59.680
But is that a real choice?

00:39:59.680 --> 00:40:02.380
Yes, I mean,
[INAUDIBLE] is a choice

00:40:02.380 --> 00:40:05.300
because the alternative
is starvation.

00:40:05.300 --> 00:40:07.580
But if you had different
social arrangements,

00:40:07.580 --> 00:40:11.340
these people would not
choose that kind of thing.

00:40:11.340 --> 00:40:15.380
So in this regard, I'm always
reminded of this famous saying

00:40:15.380 --> 00:40:20.510
by this Brazilian bishop
called Dom Helder Camara who

00:40:20.510 --> 00:40:24.140
was one of the leaders of the
liberation theology, which

00:40:24.140 --> 00:40:28.150
is the radical left-wing
Catholic theology that

00:40:28.150 --> 00:40:33.150
was quite popular in Latin
America in the 1950s and '60s.

00:40:33.150 --> 00:40:39.030
And Camara said, "When
I give food to the poor,

00:40:39.030 --> 00:40:40.620
they call me a saint.

00:40:40.620 --> 00:40:43.240
But when I ask why
these poor people do not

00:40:43.240 --> 00:40:46.410
have enough to eat, they
call me a communist."

00:40:46.410 --> 00:40:50.510
Yeah, I mean, we should all
become a bit of a communist.

00:40:50.510 --> 00:40:54.410
You should question the social
order, the economic order,

00:40:54.410 --> 00:40:57.770
underlying the
surface phenomenon

00:40:57.770 --> 00:41:03.440
and try to question whether this
order is just, or efficient,

00:41:03.440 --> 00:41:06.250
or whatever, and whether
it can be changed.

00:41:09.770 --> 00:41:11.920
Moreover, we can be
susceptible to beliefs

00:41:11.920 --> 00:41:14.660
that go against
our own interests.

00:41:14.660 --> 00:41:18.080
The Marxists used to call
this false consciousness.

00:41:18.080 --> 00:41:21.104
Today, we call it "The Matrix."

00:41:21.104 --> 00:41:23.360
The best example came
from this country

00:41:23.360 --> 00:41:26.990
when they tried to introduce
so-called Obamacare.

00:41:26.990 --> 00:41:31.150
There were pictures of these
pensioners demonstrating

00:41:31.150 --> 00:41:36.010
against Obamacare with placards
saying, "Government, hands off

00:41:36.010 --> 00:41:38.610
my Medicare program."

00:41:38.610 --> 00:41:41.770
Hello, Medicare is a
government program.

00:41:41.770 --> 00:41:43.720
But these people have
been so brainwashed

00:41:43.720 --> 00:41:48.250
by the medical insurance
lobby that they

00:41:48.250 --> 00:41:51.480
think it's a private
program because it works,

00:41:51.480 --> 00:41:54.070
because they've been told
all the time that government

00:41:54.070 --> 00:41:56.860
program never works.

00:41:56.860 --> 00:42:00.670
So we have a lot of
difficulties in changing

00:42:00.670 --> 00:42:05.840
the social order because of the
active obstruction of people

00:42:05.840 --> 00:42:11.000
who will benefit from the status
quo, the limitations of choices

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:14.220
that the markets
give to poor people,

00:42:14.220 --> 00:42:18.520
and down to false consciousness.

00:42:18.520 --> 00:42:20.810
But acknowledging
the difficulties

00:42:20.810 --> 00:42:22.690
should not make us
give up the fight

00:42:22.690 --> 00:42:28.420
to create a better economy and
in the end, a better society.

00:42:28.420 --> 00:42:30.090
Yes, changes are difficult.

00:42:30.090 --> 00:42:34.430
But in the long run, when
enough people fight for them,

00:42:34.430 --> 00:42:37.980
many impossible things happen.

00:42:37.980 --> 00:42:40.290
Yes, I mean, 200
years ago, anyone

00:42:40.290 --> 00:42:43.545
who in this country that said
we should abolish slavery,

00:42:43.545 --> 00:42:48.750
would have been branded
unrealistic at best.

00:42:48.750 --> 00:42:50.800
Yeah, and makes sense.

00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:53.370
I mean, the US
economy at the time

00:42:53.370 --> 00:42:56.815
was totally dependent
on the export of cotton,

00:42:56.815 --> 00:42:59.830
tobacco, and other
agriculture products produced

00:42:59.830 --> 00:43:03.670
by Southern plantations
that used slaves.

00:43:03.670 --> 00:43:10.170
So saying that we should
free all the slaves,

00:43:10.170 --> 00:43:12.710
that can be easily
seen as an attempt

00:43:12.710 --> 00:43:16.500
to undermine the foundation
of the US economy.

00:43:16.500 --> 00:43:19.840
And 100 years ago in
Britain and other countries,

00:43:19.840 --> 00:43:23.830
they put women in jail
for asking for vote.

00:43:23.830 --> 00:43:28.160
Only 50, 60 years ago,
all the founding fathers

00:43:28.160 --> 00:43:32.270
of most of today's
developing nations, well,

00:43:32.270 --> 00:43:34.900
actually including
Israel, were hunted down

00:43:34.900 --> 00:43:38.920
by the British and the
French as terrorists.

00:43:38.920 --> 00:43:42.860
And 25 years ago, not that long
ago, Margaret Thatcher famously

00:43:42.860 --> 00:43:45.230
said that, "Anyone who
thinks that there will

00:43:45.230 --> 00:43:48.150
be a black majority
rule in South Africa

00:43:48.150 --> 00:43:50.430
is living in a
cloud cuckoo land,"

00:43:50.430 --> 00:43:51.680
which is where she was living.

00:43:55.190 --> 00:43:57.270
Yeah, so all these
impossible things

00:43:57.270 --> 00:44:01.600
have happened because
people fought for them.

00:44:01.600 --> 00:44:07.080
And this is why I often
quote Antonio Gramsci,

00:44:07.080 --> 00:44:10.880
the Italian political
thinker, that we

00:44:10.880 --> 00:44:14.360
need "pessimism
of the intellect,

00:44:14.360 --> 00:44:18.730
but optimism of the will."

00:44:18.730 --> 00:44:20.680
And let me conclude
by showing you

00:44:20.680 --> 00:44:25.230
my favorite quote from
Nelson Mandela who said,

00:44:25.230 --> 00:44:28.360
"It always seems impossible
until it is done."

00:44:28.360 --> 00:44:29.545
Thank you very much.

00:44:29.545 --> 00:44:32.870
[APPLAUSE]

00:44:36.970 --> 00:44:37.470
All right.

00:44:37.470 --> 00:44:39.890
I'll be happy to
take any question

00:44:39.890 --> 00:44:42.860
and comment you may have.

00:44:42.860 --> 00:44:44.110
AUDIENCE: I have one question.

00:44:44.110 --> 00:44:47.020
So a lot of us are
evolved in technology

00:44:47.020 --> 00:44:49.020
that it seems to
me simplistically

00:44:49.020 --> 00:44:51.760
is driving up productivity.

00:44:51.760 --> 00:44:56.300
And it seems that if, just the
normal progression of things

00:44:56.300 --> 00:44:58.340
just from a mathematical
perspective,

00:44:58.340 --> 00:45:02.200
might be the case that the
needed employment to supply

00:45:02.200 --> 00:45:04.930
goods and services, I
don't see any guarantee

00:45:04.930 --> 00:45:06.710
that it needs to stay high.

00:45:06.710 --> 00:45:08.876
That, in fact, we could
have fewer and fewer people,

00:45:08.876 --> 00:45:10.560
like in agriculture
or something.

00:45:10.560 --> 00:45:12.060
So I'm just curious.

00:45:12.060 --> 00:45:16.000
Is that something that in
modern free market economics

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:19.560
people are looking
at that assumption?

00:45:19.560 --> 00:45:21.950
It seems as if we always
regard lower employment

00:45:21.950 --> 00:45:23.491
as something that
needs to get fixed.

00:45:23.491 --> 00:45:26.039
And [INAUDIBLE], with just the
right policies, we can fix it.

00:45:26.039 --> 00:45:27.580
What's the proof
that says that there

00:45:27.580 --> 00:45:31.980
is gainful employment within
a free market [INAUDIBLE]?

00:45:31.980 --> 00:45:32.730
HA-JOON CHANG: OK.

00:45:32.730 --> 00:45:36.240
Well, thank you for that
interesting question.

00:45:36.240 --> 00:45:42.030
Yes, in the long
run, we have always

00:45:42.030 --> 00:45:47.014
found work for the
majority of people.

00:45:47.014 --> 00:45:47.680
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:45:47.680 --> 00:45:49.763
But it is still is the
same. [INAUDIBLE] years ago

00:45:49.763 --> 00:45:51.560
[INAUDIBLE].

00:45:51.560 --> 00:45:53.437
So basically, [INAUDIBLE].

00:45:53.437 --> 00:45:54.520
HA-JOON CHANG: Yeah, yeah.

00:45:54.520 --> 00:45:57.880
No, let me continue.

00:45:57.880 --> 00:46:04.850
So not so long ago, even in
the fairly rich countries,

00:46:04.850 --> 00:46:08.450
15% to 20% of people
worked in agriculture.

00:46:08.450 --> 00:46:10.160
Today, it's 1% or 2%.

00:46:10.160 --> 00:46:12.140
In South Korea,
my native country,

00:46:12.140 --> 00:46:17.450
when I was born in the early
1960s, nearly 80% of people

00:46:17.450 --> 00:46:18.420
worked in agriculture.

00:46:18.420 --> 00:46:20.776
Today, it's like 3%.

00:46:20.776 --> 00:46:25.140
Yeah, so if you believe
that these people who

00:46:25.140 --> 00:46:28.970
say technological progress
destroys jobs, I mean,

00:46:28.970 --> 00:46:33.440
we would have a
terrible employment

00:46:33.440 --> 00:46:37.170
crisis over the last 200 years.

00:46:37.170 --> 00:46:43.020
So in the long run, we keep
finding new things to make,

00:46:43.020 --> 00:46:46.930
new services to provide,
and people have jobs.

00:46:46.930 --> 00:46:49.530
The trouble is in
the transition period

00:46:49.530 --> 00:46:54.900
when the change is very fast,
when a lot of people lose jobs.

00:46:54.900 --> 00:46:58.500
They need to get retooled, if
you like, and that takes time.

00:46:58.500 --> 00:47:01.910
That takes income
support and so on.

00:47:01.910 --> 00:47:04.010
And in some
countries, they manage

00:47:04.010 --> 00:47:12.530
this better than others through
various government-assisted

00:47:12.530 --> 00:47:15.000
retraining schemes and so on.

00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:20.180
So yes, I mean, technology
will create-- sorry, destroy

00:47:20.180 --> 00:47:25.070
many, many jobs, but it
will also create many.

00:47:25.070 --> 00:47:27.180
But then during the
transition period,

00:47:27.180 --> 00:47:29.530
you need some kind
of social arrangement

00:47:29.530 --> 00:47:33.710
to help people to retool
themselves to find new jobs.

00:47:33.710 --> 00:47:37.430
Some countries do it
better than others.

00:47:37.430 --> 00:47:38.880
Yes.

00:47:38.880 --> 00:47:41.336
AUDIENCE: Well, the
jobs that are replaced

00:47:41.336 --> 00:47:44.068
are not necessarily equivalent
jobs that are lost, right?

00:47:44.068 --> 00:47:45.996
There's a lot of evidence
that certain change

00:47:45.996 --> 00:47:50.100
in jobs in the middle is being
taken on by automation and jobs

00:47:50.100 --> 00:47:54.195
that are too cheap
to automate or too

00:47:54.195 --> 00:47:56.504
expensive to automate, right?

00:47:56.504 --> 00:48:01.810
And [INAUDIBLE] to
middle class jobs.

00:48:01.810 --> 00:48:04.300
HA-JOON CHANG: Yes, I mean,
this is a new phenomenon,

00:48:04.300 --> 00:48:08.900
because in the past the jobs
that have been destroyed

00:48:08.900 --> 00:48:11.950
were mainly to do
with manual labor,

00:48:11.950 --> 00:48:14.420
sort of so-called
low-class jobs.

00:48:14.420 --> 00:48:18.140
Now, it's encroaching
the middle class area.

00:48:18.140 --> 00:48:21.920
And this is probably why that
we see more anxious comments

00:48:21.920 --> 00:48:24.140
in the media because
those are people

00:48:24.140 --> 00:48:30.170
who are writing for the media
who give opinions to the media.

00:48:30.170 --> 00:48:37.620
But once again,
jobs can be created

00:48:37.620 --> 00:48:40.310
through different
social arrangements.

00:48:40.310 --> 00:48:43.500
For example, in many
European countries,

00:48:43.500 --> 00:48:45.720
a very large number
of people work

00:48:45.720 --> 00:48:49.510
in public welfare services.

00:48:49.510 --> 00:48:52.440
And yes, they were
created deliberately

00:48:52.440 --> 00:48:56.240
by government
intervention, and I

00:48:56.240 --> 00:48:58.250
don't see anything
wrong with that.

00:48:58.250 --> 00:49:02.480
So yes, I mean-- well,
basically, my view is that,

00:49:02.480 --> 00:49:05.870
yeah, the technology and
other economic forces

00:49:05.870 --> 00:49:08.530
are difficult to control.

00:49:08.530 --> 00:49:11.480
But they are not
like earthquake.

00:49:11.480 --> 00:49:13.150
They are not like typhoon.

00:49:13.150 --> 00:49:16.490
I mean, there are different
ways of dealing with them.

00:49:16.490 --> 00:49:18.760
And for example, a
lot of people have

00:49:18.760 --> 00:49:22.220
argued that because of
globalization, inequality

00:49:22.220 --> 00:49:24.500
is rising everywhere.

00:49:24.500 --> 00:49:26.790
This is not true.

00:49:26.790 --> 00:49:29.670
It hasn't risen in Switzerland.

00:49:29.670 --> 00:49:37.810
Also, if you look at the data,
before taxation and welfare

00:49:37.810 --> 00:49:41.660
transfer many European
countries actually

00:49:41.660 --> 00:49:44.950
are as unequal as
the United States.

00:49:44.950 --> 00:49:47.060
Sweden, Belgium,
Germany, they are

00:49:47.060 --> 00:49:49.530
very unequal before
those things.

00:49:49.530 --> 00:49:52.750
And they tax and
redistribute so much

00:49:52.750 --> 00:49:55.610
that their income inequality
after those things

00:49:55.610 --> 00:49:57.210
is much lower than in the US.

00:49:57.210 --> 00:49:59.850
So you can change those things.

00:49:59.850 --> 00:50:02.020
This is not to say that
those countries were not

00:50:02.020 --> 00:50:04.385
affected by globalization
and technological changes

00:50:04.385 --> 00:50:05.950
[INAUDIBLE], but
there's actually

00:50:05.950 --> 00:50:09.410
a lot more that you can
do than people suggest.

00:50:09.410 --> 00:50:12.677
So please don't think
that, I mean, it's

00:50:12.677 --> 00:50:14.260
all because of
technology or whatever,

00:50:14.260 --> 00:50:16.170
middle-class jobs will
have to disappear.

00:50:16.170 --> 00:50:17.770
No, they don't have to.

00:50:17.770 --> 00:50:18.270
Yes.

00:50:18.270 --> 00:50:21.420
AUDIENCE: I was wondering,
isn't-- to me it has also some

00:50:21.420 --> 00:50:24.380
similarity to some of
the philosophical change

00:50:24.380 --> 00:50:29.020
[INAUDIBLE] we have in
this country from, say,

00:50:29.020 --> 00:50:32.394
the 10-hour workday to
the 8-hour workday, where,

00:50:32.394 --> 00:50:36.250
at first, it was union
fights, whatever, to do that.

00:50:36.250 --> 00:50:38.498
And companies say, well,
we're going to cut your pay

00:50:38.498 --> 00:50:40.053
and we'll cut your hours.

00:50:40.053 --> 00:50:43.340
And strikers say, no,
[INAUDIBLE] hours.

00:50:43.340 --> 00:50:47.830
And where the money was coming
from, just a change in who's

00:50:47.830 --> 00:50:48.942
driving what.

00:50:48.942 --> 00:50:50.691
The scale might be a
little bit different,

00:50:50.691 --> 00:50:54.373
but it seems that just the
underlying assumptions of, we

00:50:54.373 --> 00:50:57.565
earn our food, whatever,
from work, these jobs exist,

00:50:57.565 --> 00:50:58.860
and they go away.

00:50:58.860 --> 00:51:00.580
And you said, who suffers?

00:51:00.580 --> 00:51:02.875
Even though the
assumptions of almost

00:51:02.875 --> 00:51:06.056
seem to be [INAUDIBLE] needs to
change just sort oif like they

00:51:06.056 --> 00:51:07.014
changed in those times.

00:51:07.014 --> 00:51:08.970
HA-JOON CHANG: Yeah,
absolutely, I mean, yeah.

00:51:08.970 --> 00:51:11.720
I mean, I have this
beautiful example

00:51:11.720 --> 00:51:15.720
in the chapter on
work in this book.

00:51:15.720 --> 00:51:21.220
In 1905, New York State
introduced this law

00:51:21.220 --> 00:51:25.070
restricting the working hours
of bakers, bakery workers,

00:51:25.070 --> 00:51:28.660
to like 10 hours.

00:51:28.660 --> 00:51:33.300
Typically, bakers work 14 hours
in those days, some of them 16.

00:51:33.300 --> 00:51:37.680
So New York State thought
that this is outrageous,

00:51:37.680 --> 00:51:38.760
wanted to regulate it.

00:51:38.760 --> 00:51:42.960
The Supreme Court struck
it out as unconstitutional

00:51:42.960 --> 00:51:45.880
as it deprives the
workers the freedom

00:51:45.880 --> 00:51:48.910
to work as long as they want.

00:51:48.910 --> 00:51:51.230
Yeah, so that there
was a time when even

00:51:51.230 --> 00:51:54.250
16-hour work was considered OK.

00:51:54.250 --> 00:51:56.200
And yes, people
have fought for it

00:51:56.200 --> 00:51:58.840
and, I mean, got these rights.

00:51:58.840 --> 00:52:03.760
And I mean, it's exactly
where politics comes in.

00:52:03.760 --> 00:52:06.250
Of course, I mean, there
were also economic forces.

00:52:06.250 --> 00:52:08.600
People are, relatively
speaking, becoming

00:52:08.600 --> 00:52:12.520
more valuable than when
the country was poorer.

00:52:12.520 --> 00:52:14.980
So there was also
economic forces.

00:52:14.980 --> 00:52:18.500
But economic forces only
give you the outer boundary.

00:52:18.500 --> 00:52:21.740
Exactly where you end
up within that boundary

00:52:21.740 --> 00:52:25.670
depends on your political
action, union activities,

00:52:25.670 --> 00:52:30.450
or democratic pressure,
and things like that.

00:52:30.450 --> 00:52:31.040
Yes.

00:52:31.040 --> 00:52:35.420
AUDIENCE: So I think, in
response to the productivity

00:52:35.420 --> 00:52:38.860
question, there's always
stuff for people to do.

00:52:38.860 --> 00:52:42.150
The issue is whether
society-- or how much

00:52:42.150 --> 00:52:45.950
society values that be done.

00:52:45.950 --> 00:52:47.760
When I was in Hong
Kong 20 years ago,

00:52:47.760 --> 00:52:49.400
there were people
whose job it was

00:52:49.400 --> 00:52:51.170
to go down the
street every morning

00:52:51.170 --> 00:52:54.144
with a broom and a basket
sweeping everything up

00:52:54.144 --> 00:52:55.060
from the night before.

00:52:55.060 --> 00:52:57.060
HA-JOON CHANG:
That's right, yeah.

00:52:57.060 --> 00:53:03.010
AUDIENCE: During the Depression,
the WPA, the New Deal,

00:53:03.010 --> 00:53:06.110
created jobs by saying,
we need infrastructure

00:53:06.110 --> 00:53:07.570
in our national parks.

00:53:07.570 --> 00:53:10.230
We need a bathhouse on
Revere Beach, right?

00:53:10.230 --> 00:53:15.030
And it's a question of whether
you have to what extent

00:53:15.030 --> 00:53:17.520
the work is valued, right,
the work is of value.

00:53:17.520 --> 00:53:19.360
HA-JOON CHANG: Yeah,
exactly, yeah, yeah.

00:53:19.360 --> 00:53:24.980
Well, that's
absolutely why, I mean,

00:53:24.980 --> 00:53:29.410
the economic values of jobs
are, I mean, in large part,

00:53:29.410 --> 00:53:31.330
created by the society.

00:53:31.330 --> 00:53:38.800
So if you begin to hire all
lot of, say, [INAUDIBLE] nurses

00:53:38.800 --> 00:53:46.710
to available-- sorry, to enable
women to leave their children

00:53:46.710 --> 00:53:52.690
and go out to work, that
creates a certain dynamic.

00:53:52.690 --> 00:53:55.080
But if the government
isn't willing to fund

00:53:55.080 --> 00:53:57.420
that kind of thing,
only rich women

00:53:57.420 --> 00:53:59.380
will be able to
afford those things.

00:53:59.380 --> 00:54:03.110
So the value of the
women's work itself

00:54:03.110 --> 00:54:06.490
is dependent on the political
action of the governments.

00:54:06.490 --> 00:54:09.710
And that's another example, but
yes, you're absolutely right.

00:54:09.710 --> 00:54:15.608
I mean, what is valuable work
is partly socially determined.

00:54:15.608 --> 00:54:16.890
Yes.

00:54:16.890 --> 00:54:19.060
AUDIENCE: So inequality
is increasing,

00:54:19.060 --> 00:54:23.590
and I think my understanding
is that mobility is decreasing,

00:54:23.590 --> 00:54:25.070
in the United States at least.

00:54:25.070 --> 00:54:28.110
Is there any way that
that can be reversed

00:54:28.110 --> 00:54:30.320
without significant
policy changes,

00:54:30.320 --> 00:54:35.197
or is that something that will
sort of, in theory, depending--

00:54:35.197 --> 00:54:36.030
HA-JOON CHANG: Yeah.

00:54:36.030 --> 00:54:36.530
No, no, no.

00:54:36.530 --> 00:54:39.420
I mean, it is a
general phenomenon.

00:54:39.420 --> 00:54:42.570
I mean, with increasing
inequality, mobility falls.

00:54:42.570 --> 00:54:46.420
I mean, it's a
well-known regularity.

00:54:46.420 --> 00:54:48.770
Now, I think that what we
have to think about here

00:54:48.770 --> 00:54:53.640
is that people who say, well,
inequality should be accepted,

00:54:53.640 --> 00:54:58.620
usually tend to focus on
equality of opportunity.

00:54:58.620 --> 00:55:02.230
Yeah, so as far as you
had the same opportunity,

00:55:02.230 --> 00:55:05.460
you shouldn't complain because
the more competent people will

00:55:05.460 --> 00:55:08.720
rise to the top and less
competent people with fall

00:55:08.720 --> 00:55:10.930
to the bottom.

00:55:10.930 --> 00:55:16.790
This will be correct if you
lived in Aldous Huxley's "Brave

00:55:16.790 --> 00:55:19.830
New World," and everyone was
raised under same condition.

00:55:19.830 --> 00:55:21.580
But they are not.

00:55:21.580 --> 00:55:26.680
So if you have richer parents,
you get more attention.

00:55:26.680 --> 00:55:28.150
You get better education.

00:55:28.150 --> 00:55:29.870
You get better
nutrition, and so on.

00:55:29.870 --> 00:55:35.390
So it's not like a
race where no one is

00:55:35.390 --> 00:55:37.740
allowed to have a head start.

00:55:37.740 --> 00:55:40.430
It's equality of opportunity.

00:55:40.430 --> 00:55:43.860
But you don't mention that
some kids have only one leg.

00:55:43.860 --> 00:55:45.180
So is it a fair race?

00:55:45.180 --> 00:55:49.970
So we need to think
about these trends,

00:55:49.970 --> 00:55:52.920
the generational
transmission of inequality.

00:55:52.920 --> 00:55:58.931
And yes, I'm afraid on this
you equalize the-- I mean,

00:55:58.931 --> 00:56:00.430
not necessarily the
parental income,

00:56:00.430 --> 00:56:05.200
but the life opportunities
that children

00:56:05.200 --> 00:56:07.290
have when they're
young, we are not

00:56:07.290 --> 00:56:08.680
going to solve this problem.

00:56:08.680 --> 00:56:12.540
And I mean, there's a
lot of research showing

00:56:12.540 --> 00:56:15.810
how social mobility in, for
example, Scandinavian countries

00:56:15.810 --> 00:56:17.940
is much, much higher
than in countries

00:56:17.940 --> 00:56:19.930
like Britain and
the United States

00:56:19.930 --> 00:56:22.560
because they provide
those conditions

00:56:22.560 --> 00:56:24.350
when children are young.

00:56:24.350 --> 00:56:27.140
Whereas in the US
and Britain, they

00:56:27.140 --> 00:56:29.280
don't do that to
the same extent.

00:56:29.280 --> 00:56:31.590
So yes, I mean, we need
that policy intervention.

00:56:31.590 --> 00:56:35.730
I mean, we'll need some
reduction in income inequality.

00:56:35.730 --> 00:56:39.290
But you should have more
focused intervention

00:56:39.290 --> 00:56:44.440
in terms of childhood
stimulus and nutrition

00:56:44.440 --> 00:56:45.400
and opportunities.

00:56:48.240 --> 00:56:49.202
Yes, miss.

00:56:49.202 --> 00:56:50.660
AUDIENCE: I'm
significantly shorter

00:56:50.660 --> 00:56:53.460
than the person who
was here before me.

00:56:53.460 --> 00:56:56.600
In the beginning, you kind of
mentioned that we, as people,

00:56:56.600 --> 00:56:58.100
have opinions on
all kinds of topics

00:56:58.100 --> 00:56:59.750
that we're probably
not qualified for.

00:56:59.750 --> 00:57:03.260
And I think part of that's
because various forces have

00:57:03.260 --> 00:57:05.680
kind of allowed us to mobilize
around one element of it,

00:57:05.680 --> 00:57:05.980
right?

00:57:05.980 --> 00:57:07.854
So if we think about
global warming or issues

00:57:07.854 --> 00:57:10.060
of environmentalism, we
focus on global warming,

00:57:10.060 --> 00:57:11.945
not like the 12
other issues that

00:57:11.945 --> 00:57:14.990
are part of this
broader need to fix

00:57:14.990 --> 00:57:17.020
what's happening
environmentally.

00:57:17.020 --> 00:57:19.760
So what would you say are the
one or two economic issues

00:57:19.760 --> 00:57:23.700
that we, as laypeople, or me, as
someone who has a liberal arts

00:57:23.700 --> 00:57:26.330
background, could
maybe mobilize around

00:57:26.330 --> 00:57:28.540
to invoke more conversation?

00:57:28.540 --> 00:57:30.340
HA-JOON CHANG: Well,
this sort of depends

00:57:30.340 --> 00:57:34.790
on the exact society
we are talking about,

00:57:34.790 --> 00:57:38.360
because does some
organization A have

00:57:38.360 --> 00:57:43.560
to address the questions
that are the most important

00:57:43.560 --> 00:57:44.920
for that particular society?

00:57:44.920 --> 00:57:50.890
And also, different people react
to the same thing differently.

00:57:50.890 --> 00:57:55.030
So it is well-known that
in this country, typically,

00:57:55.030 --> 00:57:59.500
the tolerance for inequality
is a lot higher than, say,

00:57:59.500 --> 00:58:02.370
in European countries,
which doesn't necessarily

00:58:02.370 --> 00:58:04.600
mean that inequality
shouldn't be an issue here.

00:58:04.600 --> 00:58:06.240
But you need to
consider these things.

00:58:06.240 --> 00:58:08.090
And yes, you're
absolutely right.

00:58:08.090 --> 00:58:12.770
I mean, what people find
difficult in their attempt

00:58:12.770 --> 00:58:15.940
to be an active
responsible citizen is

00:58:15.940 --> 00:58:18.641
that there are so many issues.

00:58:18.641 --> 00:58:24.470
And I sometimes joke that the
most difficult job in the world

00:58:24.470 --> 00:58:28.010
is to be a responsible citizen
of a democratic country

00:58:28.010 --> 00:58:31.920
because you have to care about
everything from global warming

00:58:31.920 --> 00:58:36.070
to your country's income
inequality, balance

00:58:36.070 --> 00:58:40.480
of payments, monetary policy,
the defense policy, what

00:58:40.480 --> 00:58:40.980
have you.

00:58:40.980 --> 00:58:43.950
So yes, I mean, if
you tell people,

00:58:43.950 --> 00:58:47.840
well, we have like 727 issues,
let's all think about it,

00:58:47.840 --> 00:58:49.060
they'll not do it.

00:58:49.060 --> 00:58:50.410
So you need to focus.

00:58:50.410 --> 00:58:54.640
But exactly what are
those one or two issues

00:58:54.640 --> 00:58:56.345
will depend on the
time and the country.

00:58:56.345 --> 00:59:00.920
And yes, I think that in the
US, the concern for inequality

00:59:00.920 --> 00:59:04.770
has actually become very strong.

00:59:04.770 --> 00:59:09.220
I wouldn't have imagined it to
be so even, say, 10 years ago.

00:59:09.220 --> 00:59:11.150
But yes, I mean, this
might be your chance

00:59:11.150 --> 00:59:13.740
to address some of this
inequality problem,

00:59:13.740 --> 00:59:16.230
even though the final
outcome might be

00:59:16.230 --> 00:59:19.400
you are still more
unequal than, say, Sweden.

00:59:19.400 --> 00:59:23.690
So yes, I mean, you'll have
to think about those things

00:59:23.690 --> 00:59:26.780
and try to focus people's
minds, because when

00:59:26.780 --> 00:59:30.550
I said my intellectual hero,
Herbert Simon once said,

00:59:30.550 --> 00:59:37.830
"The most scarce resource in
human society is attention."

00:59:37.830 --> 00:59:38.560
Yes, please.

00:59:38.560 --> 00:59:43.015
AUDIENCE: Now, what happened
to UK on Friday's [INAUDIBLE]?

00:59:43.015 --> 00:59:43.765
HA-JOON CHANG: Ah.

00:59:43.765 --> 00:59:45.781
[LAUGHTER]

00:59:45.781 --> 00:59:47.780
AUDIENCE: Economic
[INAUDIBLE] end of the world.

00:59:47.780 --> 00:59:48.613
HA-JOON CHANG: Yeah.

00:59:48.613 --> 00:59:51.230
Well, I am not a
UK citizen, so I

00:59:51.230 --> 00:59:54.580
don't have to worry about that.

00:59:54.580 --> 00:59:56.890
The UK equivalent
of a green card.

00:59:56.890 --> 01:00:03.610
Yes, but I think this is
quite a complicated issue

01:00:03.610 --> 01:00:11.040
because if you read about the
history of the United Kingdom

01:00:11.040 --> 01:00:13.020
in the last three
centuries, actually

01:00:13.020 --> 01:00:17.290
the Scots were crucial in
building the UK economy.

01:00:17.290 --> 01:00:20.510
All the early economists,
Adam Smith, well,

01:00:20.510 --> 01:00:24.830
except for David Ricardo
who was a Jew, were Scots.

01:00:24.830 --> 01:00:27.200
The guy who set up
the Bank of England

01:00:27.200 --> 01:00:29.960
was a Scotsman called Paterson.

01:00:29.960 --> 01:00:36.380
I mean, the way that these
two countries work together

01:00:36.380 --> 01:00:38.370
was quite amazing.

01:00:38.370 --> 01:00:43.940
And yeah, now the Scots are
saying, we want to leave.

01:00:43.940 --> 01:00:48.490
I think that one difficulty here
is that the Scots, many Scots

01:00:48.490 --> 01:00:51.530
see it as a way to get rid
of the Conservative Party

01:00:51.530 --> 01:00:55.040
rather than truly be
a separate country.

01:00:55.040 --> 01:00:57.130
So yeah, they might
be in for a shock.

01:00:57.130 --> 01:01:00.940
Because my view is why not?

01:01:00.940 --> 01:01:04.180
Yeah, there are a lot of small,
very prosperous countries.

01:01:04.180 --> 01:01:08.450
Finland has less than
5 million people.

01:01:08.450 --> 01:01:12.290
Denmark has 5 million people.

01:01:12.290 --> 01:01:14.170
Austria has 7 million.

01:01:14.170 --> 01:01:15.500
Switzerland has 7 million.

01:01:15.500 --> 01:01:16.330
So why not?

01:01:16.330 --> 01:01:21.990
But this will create quite a
disruption in the short run.

01:01:21.990 --> 01:01:25.230
And yes, the UK
economy might suffer

01:01:25.230 --> 01:01:29.850
because of all this
short-term turmoil.

01:01:29.850 --> 01:01:34.990
And can it survive that
given its weakened state?

01:01:34.990 --> 01:01:35.860
I don't know.

01:01:35.860 --> 01:01:40.190
I mean, because
the UK economy was

01:01:40.190 --> 01:01:45.270
damaged a lot more by
this 2008 financial crisis

01:01:45.270 --> 01:01:48.830
than even the United States
because its reliance on finance

01:01:48.830 --> 01:01:50.620
was much higher.

01:01:50.620 --> 01:01:54.450
And yeah, I shudder to
think what will happen,

01:01:54.450 --> 01:01:56.610
but it's not for me to say.

01:02:01.092 --> 01:02:03.582
Any more?

01:02:03.582 --> 01:02:05.980
Well, thank you very
much for listening.

01:02:05.980 --> 01:02:09.330
[APPLAUSE]
