00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.817
Being familiar with your
competitive advantages and

00:00:02.817 --> 00:00:06.718
disadvantages will help you position
yourself among your customers.

00:00:06.718 --> 00:00:08.840
You may want to include
this in your pitch deck, or

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:11.350
somehow share this information
with your customers.

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:13.180
What is your unique value?

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:14.960
Now if you know this answer,

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:17.230
it's going to help you
shape your marketing plan.

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:20.940
The advantages can be based on
one of the five P's of marketing.

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:22.080
Let's look at those.

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:28.617
The 5 P's of Marketing are, product,
price, promotion, place and people.

00:00:28.617 --> 00:00:32.320
Now, these are going to help you
evaluate your main advantages over your

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:33.910
competitors.

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:37.100
For product, do you have any
features that others don't have?

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.130
Do you provide value in some way?

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:43.695
For price, are you about to bring the
exact same value but lower the price?

00:00:43.695 --> 00:00:47.705
Now that would be a great value to
your customer that are on a budget.

00:00:47.705 --> 00:00:50.645
And for promotion, maybe you have
some marketing channels that you use

00:00:50.645 --> 00:00:53.565
to promote your business or
to generate sales.

00:00:53.565 --> 00:00:56.825
For place, do you have a unique
place you can sell your product?

00:00:56.825 --> 00:00:59.600
Maybe it used to only be sold in stores.

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.670
And now you can sell it on line,
or vice versa.

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.150
And finally we have people.

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:05.864
What are the strengths of your team?

00:01:05.864 --> 00:01:08.842
What are your co-founders bringing to
the table that's going to help make you

00:01:08.842 --> 00:01:10.080
successful?

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.380
Now I want you to take a few minutes
to think about your own competitive

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:14.430
advantages for your idea?

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.760
Or you can use Embarkment
if you don't have one.

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:21.360
Go through each of these and think about
what your advantages over your customer.

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.140
So for product, what features do you
have that your main competitor doesn't?

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.590
Or are you cheaper, more expensive
than your main competitor?

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:29.860
Things like that.

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:33.230
Now using the blanks below,
fill in a competitive advantage for

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:35.210
each of the five Ps of marketing.

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:37.160
Now be sure to save your
answers somewhere else,

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:38.410
because we'll be using these again.
