00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.340
Let's add a service worker
to the Wittr project and

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:04.750
start messing around
with these requests.

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:07.840
To make things easy the project
already contains a script file

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:11.500
at public &gt; js &gt; sw &gt; index.js.

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:13.760
And it's currently empty.

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:15.219
So let's add a quick console log.

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:18.020
The build system picks this up and

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:22.540
the final result is served at
sw.js at the root of the server.

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:26.006
The extra code here is the output
of Babel which the script runs.

00:00:26.006 --> 00:00:28.850
Babel let's you use some of
the newer JavaScript features but

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:30.077
I'm going to stick with ES5.

00:00:30.077 --> 00:00:33.120
But if you feel like writing
newer JavaScript, go ahead.

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:37.800
As we talked about before,
the service worker receives events.

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.500
let's add a listener for one of these.

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:40.950
Fetch.

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.060
When the user navigates to a page
within your service worker scope,

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:45.460
it controls it.

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:48.870
The network requests for its HTML,
goes to the service worker, and

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.820
triggers a Fetch event.

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.270
But not only that,
you also get a Fetch event for

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:55.330
every request triggered by that page.

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:58.030
CSS, JavaScript, images,
you get a Fetch event for

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:01.270
each, even if the requests
were another origin.

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:03.570
And we can inspect them with JavaScript.

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.530
So in my Fetch event,
I'm going to log event.request.

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:11.020
To find out what kind of
information is in that object,

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:12.240
click through to the next lesson.

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.370
That was me trying to build
up some dramatic tension.

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:20.612
I mean event.request it's clearly going
to be information about the request.

00:01:20.612 --> 00:01:22.932
Or is it.

00:01:22.932 --> 00:01:23.896
Yes.

00:01:23.896 --> 00:01:24.750
Yes it is.
