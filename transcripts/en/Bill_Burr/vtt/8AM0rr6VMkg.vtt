00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:04.530
Hey,
what's going on and spill?
Burn.
It's time for the Monday morning.

2
00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:10.100
Podcasts from March 14th,

3
00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.730
2016 how are you doing?
How's it going?
How are you all?
Wow.

4
00:00:14.731 --> 00:00:19.410
You look great.
Did you lose,
is that a new blouse?

5
00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.230
What did she tell you?
Did something different?
Um,
ah,

6
00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:26.250
is there anything worse than watching somebody do that?
You know,

7
00:00:26.251 --> 00:00:28.890
coming up and they,
they take the two women meet,
right?

8
00:00:28.891 --> 00:00:31.230
And they grab each other by both hands.
Right?

9
00:00:31.231 --> 00:00:34.380
And then they look at you and they fucking hold the hands out.

10
00:00:34.381 --> 00:00:38.460
I think I've talked about this before.
Look at you.
What are you doing?
You know,

11
00:00:38.461 --> 00:00:42.330
secretly hated the woman cause she looks better.
You know,

12
00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.010
I can't you be like guys,
we just look each other in the ag.
I said Pussy,

13
00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:56.610
I don't,
I'm talking about,
oh Billy fucking cuisine over here.

14
00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.010
I want to try to make Gnocchi this week or no?
Yeah,

15
00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.570
where the fuck you supposed to pronounce it?
Um,

16
00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.230
it doesn't seem too fucking hard.
Right?
So anyways,

17
00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.150
we got these old pants,
right?
Like everything in my life.
It's fucking old,
right?

18
00:01:12.151 --> 00:01:16.530
I'm old and everything I own is old,
cause I bought it when I was young.
Um,

19
00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.390
so I guess the Teflon or whatever the nose shit.
Well you want to have,

20
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.400
it was ted scraped off over the years and was flaking up and somebody told my

21
00:01:26.071 --> 00:01:29.820
lady that it was getting in our foods.
So now of course all that God,

22
00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:33.930
we've got to get rid of,
you know,

23
00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.610
or eating Teflon fucking omelettes.
Evidently.
I don't know.

24
00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.140
I didn't taste it.
My fucking omics bomblets or rather the delicious.

25
00:01:43.141 --> 00:01:47.100
I didn't feel any Lino crunchy.
Like,
wait a minute.
What was that?
What does that,

26
00:01:47.101 --> 00:01:50.640
what does that onions or was that part of the frying pan?
I can't tell.

27
00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.950
It's such a similar taste.
Eggs and parts of the frying pan,

28
00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:58.170
you know,
I don't know.
I figured,
you know,

29
00:01:58.171 --> 00:02:01.950
with the amount of booze and I do whatever that,
that,
you know,

30
00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:07.250
Teflon that went to my system got eaten up by the fucking my liquid diet.

31
00:02:07.501 --> 00:02:11.820
Right.
But whatever.
So now we gotta go get a fucking frying pan.
So I go,

32
00:02:11.821 --> 00:02:13.440
all right.
You know,
we,
we,

33
00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.320
we have one nice one and then we had like three shit ones.

34
00:02:16.321 --> 00:02:17.460
So the three shit once,

35
00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.810
I guess we're giving us cancer because someone who isn't a doctor saw,

36
00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.110
saw the pants and told us that that was what was,
what was happening.

37
00:02:25.111 --> 00:02:26.850
So we threw those outs and all that.

38
00:02:26.851 --> 00:02:30.300
I'm sure those are going to be fucking hitting some octopus on the fucking head

39
00:02:30.301 --> 00:02:33.000
when they dump it into the ocean soon and up to now I'm going to go buy some

40
00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.850
work,
right?
I already had what I needed and I throw it out tonight.

41
00:02:36.851 --> 00:02:41.851
I got to go buy some more classic fucking capitalism.

42
00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:43.960
It's how it works.
It's how we keep it going.

43
00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:46.710
That's how we keep the plates spinning.
You go out,

44
00:02:46.711 --> 00:02:48.810
you buy what you need and then when you have it,

45
00:02:48.811 --> 00:02:53.370
you throw it out and then your rebuy it and the second people stopped doing
that.

46
00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.730
This whole country goes down the shitter.
That's it.
That's how simple it is.

47
00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.440
All these fucking stupid terrorists over there,

48
00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:02.320
you know who think they've got to come over here and bomb us?

49
00:03:02.321 --> 00:03:06.340
All they gotta do is just,
just start sending leaflets over here,

50
00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:11.140
telling us not to buy stuff.
Hey wait,
you already own that?

51
00:03:11.141 --> 00:03:15.580
You don't need to buy that.
Keep the money.
Treat yourself.
Put your feet up.

52
00:03:15.581 --> 00:03:19.570
Don't go to the mall.
Relax.
Just send,
you know,
propaganda like we used to in the,

53
00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:24.250
in the wars,
right.
We drop and drop little leaflets.
You know,

54
00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:25.730
I would love to read one of those.

55
00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:30.460
Everything that ain't fucking pictures of those wartime leaflets to try to get

56
00:03:30.461 --> 00:03:33.010
people like,
I don't understand how the fuck are you going to do that?
Like,

57
00:03:33.011 --> 00:03:36.730
I don't think I could ever fly over Yankee stadium with leaflets telling people

58
00:03:36.731 --> 00:03:38.260
to become red sox fan.
So like,

59
00:03:38.261 --> 00:03:42.500
how do you dern a fucking war when the country that's bombing your country's

60
00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:45.910
going to send you a leaflet.
What the fuck does it say on it?
Yeah.
Hey,

61
00:03:45.911 --> 00:03:49.350
sorry about,
are most of your relatives a anyways,

62
00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.040
you want to come over to our side?

63
00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:56.650
We could get you AMC in which they're fucking smoky.

64
00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:00.640
Um,
alright.
Let's see.
World War,

65
00:04:00.641 --> 00:04:04.900
two leaflets.
Leaflet.

66
00:04:04.901 --> 00:04:06.940
Propaganda.
All right.
Let's read a couple of these.

67
00:04:06.941 --> 00:04:09.640
Let me see if this would make you fucking switch sides.

68
00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:15.030
Go from Red Sox to the Yankees are fucking Dodgers to giants are fucking

69
00:04:15.251 --> 00:04:20.170
avalanche to the fucking red wings or a Michigander

70
00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:21.713
<v 1>hi.</v>

71
00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:30.160
<v 0>You get,
um,
all right.</v>

72
00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:33.250
Oh,
Jesus Christ.
Look at this one.

73
00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:39.520
Why are you German?
Still fighting?
Not that that's no way to get the reader.

74
00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.180
The question is extremely difficult to answer.

75
00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:47.140
Did they understand that these people spoke,
spoke German?

76
00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:48.790
You're going to write it.

77
00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:54.290
This is almost over my head and I speak the fucking language.
Uh,

78
00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:58.270
why are you German still fighting on via your Jeremy's still fighting's a

79
00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:02.070
funeral.
Blow his fucking brains out next to his six of a chip.
Then,
uh,

80
00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:05.230
the question is extremely difficult to answer.
In fact,

81
00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:09.340
there is no reasonable answer to it at all.
You go on fighting,

82
00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:10.830
although you cannot,

83
00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:14.710
I should believe fucking click on the page here so I can read this a little

84
00:05:14.711 --> 00:05:18.700
bigger.
Oh,
and then it always disappears.
Doesn't it always disappear?

85
00:05:18.701 --> 00:05:20.980
You just click on it.
Where did it go?
Okay,
there we go.
All right?

86
00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:23.350
You go on fighting,
although you cannot

87
00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.410
help but realize that Germany is losing the war.
Wow.

88
00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:34.360
Jesus.
This would make me want to be you have fuck these fucking assholes.
Uh,

89
00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:38.560
you go on fighting.
Although you know that every day,
which the war still lasts,

90
00:05:38.561 --> 00:05:40.510
means new destruction to your homeland,

91
00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:44.650
new danger in new hardships to your family.
You go on fighting.

92
00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:49.680
Although it is clear that the only people interested in the pro prolongation of

93
00:05:50.261 --> 00:05:53.020
the war,
someone's going to read that in a second language.

94
00:05:53.021 --> 00:05:57.770
I can't even read prolongation of the war are the party leaders who want to at

95
00:05:57.771 --> 00:05:59.840
any price the consequences,

96
00:05:59.841 --> 00:06:04.070
which the Nazi defeat is inevitably going to have for them personally.

97
00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:06.670
In other words,
we're going to hang them.
Uh,

98
00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:09.920
remember that your dear ones want you back alive.

99
00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:15.040
Remember also that there is only one safe way home the way through allied

100
00:06:16.311 --> 00:06:20.270
captivity.
You know,

101
00:06:20.271 --> 00:06:23.780
we had a lot of balls dropping these after we were firebombing fucking cities,

102
00:06:23.781 --> 00:06:25.850
Huh?
Yeah.
You know,
I know we just burned.

103
00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:30.110
You're all fucking city to the ground and evidently he didn't die screaming in

104
00:06:30.111 --> 00:06:34.550
agony.
A,
the only way for you to avoid that is to,
uh,
become our prisoner.

105
00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:40.730
According to the Geneva Conventions,
which has been recognized by Brazil,

106
00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:45.530
you will have the following,
uh,
privileges in allied captivity.
Oh,

107
00:06:45.531 --> 00:06:50.030
Jesus.
This is,
this is the classic checks in the fucking mail.

108
00:06:50.031 --> 00:06:52.640
You will be removed immediately from the battle zone.

109
00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:57.410
You will get the same food as allied troops.
If six sick,

110
00:06:57.411 --> 00:07:00.440
you will be treated in the same hospitals as our soldiers.

111
00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:05.450
And after the end of the war,
you will go home as soon as possible.
Well,

112
00:07:05.451 --> 00:07:10.370
that's pretty vague.
As soon as we,
uh,
decide when you can fucking leave.

113
00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:14.980
Did anybody believe a word of that?
I didn't.
I wouldn't do it.
I was like,

114
00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:17.000
you know what the fuck you want these fucking guys are doing.

115
00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:18.440
They want us to surrender

116
00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:19.940
<v 1>because they don't want us to kill more of them.</v>

117
00:07:19.941 --> 00:07:22.170
They're just going to fucking kill us.
You know what I take?

118
00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:27.580
<v 0>Well,
it's,
yeah,
he speaks the truth.
Um,</v>

119
00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:31.570
that was me in a foxhole with a Boston accent talking to somebody who sounds

120
00:07:31.571 --> 00:07:33.190
like Hans and Franz.
How'd you like that?

121
00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:37.600
He didn't think that was coming on the old podcast.
They did you,
um,

122
00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:40.210
fuck did I start talking about World War II leaflets?

123
00:07:40.211 --> 00:07:41.920
I was talking about buying a frying pan.
Oh yeah.

124
00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:46.270
So I get down the street driving down the old road there.

125
00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:49.360
Okay.
It's a Sunday evening.
I'm like,
you know what,

126
00:07:49.361 --> 00:07:53.380
I'm going to knock this shit out before Monday comes around and all these

127
00:07:53.381 --> 00:07:56.950
assholes have to go to work.
You know what I mean?
Oh,
I'm sorry.

128
00:07:56.951 --> 00:08:00.190
It's an election year.
All these hard work and uh,
Joe six backs,

129
00:08:00.191 --> 00:08:03.160
they put that Vance on one layer.
Um,

130
00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:06.910
anybody who's in my ways and ask is there either a cunt.
Okay.

131
00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:10.830
And I wish I was more enlightened to realize that I'm just impatient.
But,
uh,

132
00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:14.230
that's,
you know,
it hasn't happened yet.
So anyways,

133
00:08:14.231 --> 00:08:18.640
so I'm driving down the fucking road,
cruising along,
you know,

134
00:08:18.641 --> 00:08:19.540
and all of a sudden,
you know,

135
00:08:19.541 --> 00:08:23.860
they're doing road construction and it's just this massive fucking traffic jam.

136
00:08:24.790 --> 00:08:27.560
And I knew I had to do the podcast tonight cause I'm doing some bullshit

137
00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:31.210
tomorrow morning and I'm just like,
it can,
you can get this fucking city.

138
00:08:31.211 --> 00:08:35.800
Can it just ever give me a fucking break?
You know,
I gotta tell you something.

139
00:08:35.801 --> 00:08:39.100
All these shit where they talk about new Yorky,
you know if I can,

140
00:08:40.590 --> 00:08:41.530
<v 1>yeah.</v>

141
00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:43.590
<v 0>Oh that shit.
You know,</v>

142
00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:46.710
they're always blow in New York about how fucking difficult it is.

143
00:08:46.711 --> 00:08:50.250
I got to tell you.
Okay,
there's an outsider from Massachusetts.

144
00:08:50.470 --> 00:08:51.720
I've lived in both places.

145
00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:56.250
New York is definitely has its of grinding you down,

146
00:08:56.251 --> 00:09:00.390
but there is no place like fucking Los Angeles do this,
this fucking city.

147
00:09:01.910 --> 00:09:06.060
It's just,
it's brutal.
It's just fucking,
it never,

148
00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:08.820
never lets up,
you know.

149
00:09:08.821 --> 00:09:13.050
And then the whole time you're just bacon in the son of the exact same weather

150
00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:14.790
every fucking day.

151
00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:17.160
And everybody in the east coast comes out here and they're like here for five,

152
00:09:17.161 --> 00:09:19.140
six days.
Oh my God,
this is great.
This is great.
Yeah,

153
00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:21.690
there's great for six days it's fucking great.
But every day,

154
00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:25.530
waking up that fucking Sun,
Sun,
Sun,
Sun,

155
00:09:26.090 --> 00:09:29.970
burn it down on your fucking head.
I'm telling you this fucking place.

156
00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:35.900
And you combine that with being in this business that I'm in trying to fucking

157
00:09:36.001 --> 00:09:40.770
move ahead.
It is.
It is brutal.
Fucking brutal and all that shit.
You know?

158
00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:45.030
I can't tell you how many fucking New York comedians have moved out here and

159
00:09:45.031 --> 00:09:48.060
then moved back.
I moved back.
First Time I came out of it,
I couldn't take it.

160
00:09:48.061 --> 00:09:51.680
I was like,
I gotta get the Fuck Outta here.
I'm telling you,
they're always so,
oh,

161
00:09:51.690 --> 00:09:56.520
you know New York is so fucking real.
I'll fuck you.
Fuck you.
Bullshit.

162
00:09:56.550 --> 00:09:57.570
You couldn't take it.

163
00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:01.680
He couldn't take it and you wanted to move back to your familiar surroundings.

164
00:10:01.730 --> 00:10:04.710
The only be 20 minutes away from your grandmother's special sauce.

165
00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:08.210
That's why the fuck you moved back.
All right.

166
00:10:08.910 --> 00:10:13.590
You're dumb fucking leather coat.
The pizza sucks out here.
You know,

167
00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:19.530
I'm telling you,
if I devote,
which is a tougher city to live in,

168
00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:24.100
I would definitely say Los Angeles over in New York.
It is.
Fuck yeah,
dude.

169
00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:27.200
This said fucking catches on fire out here.
There's mudslides,

170
00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:32.130
this fucking earthquakes,
you know,
in New York,

171
00:10:32.131 --> 00:10:32.720
what's great about,

172
00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:35.520
but I'm just talking basically trying to make it in show business to live in New

173
00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:38.340
York,
in show business,
which is what is great about it is,

174
00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:41.220
is you can get on the subway in,

175
00:10:41.221 --> 00:10:45.990
stand amongst a bunch of regular people,
real people,

176
00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:49.590
right?
And then you get to feel this feeling that,
that you're real,

177
00:10:50.250 --> 00:10:52.740
that you're not this big showbiz fucking phony.

178
00:10:52.741 --> 00:10:56.460
Who wants their own Goddamn TV show in New York.
It's so fucking real.

179
00:10:56.461 --> 00:11:00.990
Look at that chair.
Look out real.
That fucking chair is right.
Um,

180
00:11:02.490 --> 00:11:05.590
I just think because you know,
everybody's all mixed into fucking gather.

181
00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:08.340
He ride on the subway that these New York showbiz people,

182
00:11:08.341 --> 00:11:11.100
they just automatically think that they're there.
You know,

183
00:11:11.130 --> 00:11:14.220
everybody here is all plastic and phony because you come out to la and the whole

184
00:11:14.221 --> 00:11:17.310
place looks like a fucking movie set,
right?
You sit there,
you know,

185
00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:21.090
you'd ride on the subway and you sit next to some fucking,
I don't know,

186
00:11:21.091 --> 00:11:22.560
some construction worker,

187
00:11:22.830 --> 00:11:26.010
union guy with this hired head getting ready and you start,
yeah,

188
00:11:26.011 --> 00:11:28.650
I one of these guys now.
Now you're not,
you're in show business.

189
00:11:28.651 --> 00:11:30.420
You're a big fucking phony,
right?

190
00:11:30.870 --> 00:11:33.480
You're on your way to puppeteer school or whatever the fuck it is.

191
00:11:33.481 --> 00:11:36.120
You're doing your little song and dance because you don't want to have a job.

192
00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:41.490
Sorry,
I shouldn't have said all that shit.
But you know,

193
00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:43.870
I really shouldn't have said that.

194
00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:47.540
And having seen all the bullshit that I've seen,
like,
you know,
uh,

195
00:11:47.610 --> 00:11:49.200
Bernie Sanders talking about her,

196
00:11:49.201 --> 00:11:51.510
I don't know what the fuck he was talking about.
Like,
I don't think it's,

197
00:11:51.511 --> 00:11:52.344
you know,

198
00:11:52.410 --> 00:11:55.840
a good way to try to bring black and white people together by talking about how

199
00:11:55.841 --> 00:11:57.640
white people have never lived in a ghetto.

200
00:11:57.970 --> 00:12:02.970
Because automatically you just going to put them into a defensive posture where

201
00:12:03.161 --> 00:12:03.510
they're going,

202
00:12:03.510 --> 00:12:05.710
they're going to sit there and think about all the shit that they've gone

203
00:12:05.711 --> 00:12:08.710
through and then they get,
and then they're going to get upset.

204
00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:12.640
You know what I mean?
Um,
yeah.
I don't,
generally speaking,

205
00:12:12.641 --> 00:12:14.140
white people do not live in ghettos.

206
00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:17.650
Although I had to think other races of people do not live in the middle of

207
00:12:17.651 --> 00:12:20.470
fucking nowhere off the Appalachian trail.
You know,

208
00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:25.330
washing their clothes in a fucking bathtub,
sharing a pair of shoes,

209
00:12:25.450 --> 00:12:29.110
some of that fucking horrific poverty that I've seen,
um,

210
00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:32.470
that most of these fucking politicians will never see.

211
00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:36.640
I don't think it's one of these fucking politicians.

212
00:12:36.641 --> 00:12:40.330
They should go on the road and open for a fucking comedian who's traveling to

213
00:12:40.331 --> 00:12:42.910
all these different,
that you will see.
Shit.
You can't fucking believe.

214
00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:47.790
You'll see levels of poverty you can't fucking believe exist in this country.
Um,

215
00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:50.210
I don't want to name cities,
but a,

216
00:12:50.211 --> 00:12:53.320
there's some places down South Jesus Christ,

217
00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:55.241
I don't know.

218
00:12:55.241 --> 00:12:58.660
One time I drove from Indianapolis to Nashville and there was some place in

219
00:12:58.661 --> 00:12:59.620
southern Kentucky.

220
00:12:59.621 --> 00:13:03.580
I was running out of gas and I pulled over and they'll fucking humanity.

221
00:13:04.990 --> 00:13:09.910
My God,
I swear to God,
there was something in the fucking drinking water.

222
00:13:09.911 --> 00:13:13.210
I've never seen it.
It was just like I do.

223
00:13:13.210 --> 00:13:17.470
I describe these people without just absolutely insulting them.
Um,

224
00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:23.350
I dunno,
it was just like,
uh,
you know,

225
00:13:23.351 --> 00:13:26.980
when somebody is like so dumb,
you get nervous.
You know,

226
00:13:27.010 --> 00:13:29.710
they start talking to you and they're looking at you and you're,

227
00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:33.100
you can tell they're just smart enough that they know that you think that

228
00:13:33.101 --> 00:13:36.490
they're dumb and you're trying not to fucking give it away.
You know,

229
00:13:36.660 --> 00:13:38.760
she just kind of puts your eyebrows up like,
Oh yeah,

230
00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:40.730
you tried to get out of the fucking conversation.
Yeah.

231
00:13:40.731 --> 00:13:42.670
It was like an entire gas station of that.

232
00:13:42.850 --> 00:13:45.970
Even the person running the gas station,
um,

233
00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:51.100
and this was off a major highway.
You know,
there was a subway,
you know,
you know,

234
00:13:51.101 --> 00:13:52.630
when you drive in the middle of nowhere,

235
00:13:52.631 --> 00:13:56.530
you don't ever go into just some fucking,
you know,
mom and pop place.

236
00:13:56.531 --> 00:14:01.330
You don't want to do that.
What you do is you stay,
you stay brand loyal.

237
00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:04.090
You pull into the Mcdonald's,
right?

238
00:14:04.091 --> 00:14:08.920
You get gas at the fucking Sunoco or whatever.
You keep it fucking,

239
00:14:08.950 --> 00:14:10.060
yeah.
You want to get breakfast?

240
00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:13.330
Let's do you want to try the [inaudible] fucking pop place where everyone's

241
00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:17.800
going to fucking turn around and look at you or we go into Denny's,
you know?

242
00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:21.730
Um,
anyways,

243
00:14:22.660 --> 00:14:26.020
I really should be talking about politics because I literally do not watch any

244
00:14:26.021 --> 00:14:30.310
of it.
Um,
I know that was all that bullshit with Trump.
I don't understand why,

245
00:14:30.311 --> 00:14:32.140
but people won't let Trump speak.

246
00:14:32.950 --> 00:14:37.000
And how you feel that that's going to derail his campaign.
I think if anything,

247
00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:39.920
it will just strengthen it.
Um,

248
00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:44.410
I'm sure there's probably plenty of Trump people that don't like what Bernie

249
00:14:44.410 --> 00:14:48.400
Sanders or Hillary saying they're not going in there and literally disrupting

250
00:14:48.401 --> 00:14:52.760
the whole fucking thing.
Right?
I Dunno.

251
00:14:53.420 --> 00:14:57.320
Just seems stupid to me.
He sees a fucking reality TV show star.

252
00:14:57.321 --> 00:15:00.290
Just let the guy talk who gives a shit.
He's not really saying anything.

253
00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:02.060
He's appealing to some people.

254
00:15:04.140 --> 00:15:07.260
Who the fuck votes in a primary anyways,
aren't you guys like,

255
00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:11.760
may I vote once every fucking four years?
I hate to say it,
but I do.
I vote one.

256
00:15:11.761 --> 00:15:13.660
I vote for president.
That's why vote for him.

257
00:15:13.661 --> 00:15:16.980
I always vote for the fucking third party person.

258
00:15:17.970 --> 00:15:19.500
Although I don't know about Bernie Sanders.

259
00:15:19.501 --> 00:15:22.760
I don't know if I'm going to fucking vote for this guy.
I'm just sick,
you know?

260
00:15:22.770 --> 00:15:23.161
Hey,

261
00:15:23.161 --> 00:15:27.900
you know we're going to take all the money from fucking these 10 people and gave

262
00:15:27.901 --> 00:15:32.550
it to all you guys cause all you guys deserve it,
right?
No,
you guys are lazy.

263
00:15:32.890 --> 00:15:36.960
Come to,
don't want to pull their own weight.
Your angels did.

264
00:15:36.961 --> 00:15:41.710
Everybody got there is devils right?
That dumb shit.
It's just as extreme.

265
00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.870
It's fucking Donald Trump to the left.
I can't listen to any of it.

266
00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:48.540
And then sitting right in the fucking middle,

267
00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:52.890
drafted behind both of them is all fucking square head herself.

268
00:15:53.850 --> 00:15:57.600
Hillary Clinton,
she's gonna fuck.
She's going to go right in underneath,

269
00:15:57.840 --> 00:15:58.980
right in underneath.

270
00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:02.220
She's going to get in there and you're going to have listened to that fucking

271
00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:05.100
busted trumpet for fucking the next four years.

272
00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:12.270
Fucking filthy,
filthy family.
I don't like any of them.
All three of them.

273
00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:13.200
You know what?

274
00:16:14.430 --> 00:16:17.640
You have a seat on the Donald Trump show when he does like a combo firing.

275
00:16:17.641 --> 00:16:19.950
You know what,
you'll find you're fucking fired and you're fired.

276
00:16:19.951 --> 00:16:22.770
That's what I would like to do with the three of them tossed him in the fucking,

277
00:16:22.771 --> 00:16:26.820
I can say that hat on because I only vote once every four years and I do not

278
00:16:26.850 --> 00:16:30.810
watch the debates.
All right,
so,
you know,
I'm standing on farm ground here.

279
00:16:32.370 --> 00:16:36.320
Such a dope.
Hey,
you know what I did do?
Um,

280
00:16:36.390 --> 00:16:38.630
God knows it wasn't read something.
Uh,

281
00:16:42.180 --> 00:16:45.630
I,
um,
I watched on Netflix,

282
00:16:45.631 --> 00:16:49.570
I watched that Ukraine documentary a winter on fire.
It,
um,

283
00:16:50.190 --> 00:16:51.023
<v 2>okay.</v>

284
00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:53.440
<v 0>You know,
it was just one of those things where it's just like Jesus Christ.</v>

285
00:16:54.580 --> 00:16:54.970
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

286
00:16:54.970 --> 00:16:59.140
<v 0>I knew I wasn't politically active,
but watching what these people did,</v>

287
00:16:59.470 --> 00:17:01.390
what they turned around,
I'll,

288
00:17:01.430 --> 00:17:05.620
I'll try to give you a simple version of what happened,
which,
you know,

289
00:17:05.621 --> 00:17:10.060
with my brain,
that's all you're going to get is basically what happened,

290
00:17:10.061 --> 00:17:13.850
I guess around 2003,
2004,
uh,

291
00:17:14.050 --> 00:17:15.730
there was some fucking Russian dude,

292
00:17:15.731 --> 00:17:18.940
pro Russian dude each claim that he won the fucking election and they were like,

293
00:17:19.090 --> 00:17:20.860
no,
you didn't,
you a piece of shit.
You're rigged it.

294
00:17:20.861 --> 00:17:24.220
And they proved it and he got bounced on 2009.

295
00:17:24.221 --> 00:17:26.680
The same dude comes back and guess what?

296
00:17:26.681 --> 00:17:31.480
He wins the election like that wasn't corrupt.
So anyways,
you,

297
00:17:31.630 --> 00:17:35.290
the Ukraine is a chance to join the European Union,
right?

298
00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:39.820
To start being more like a European country and for once and for all get out

299
00:17:39.821 --> 00:17:43.720
from underneath,
uh,
whatever you call,
whatever.
Russia has a dictatorship.

300
00:17:44.380 --> 00:17:49.380
So the fucking Russian dude who allegedly got elected legitimately,

301
00:17:50.580 --> 00:17:54.630
you know,
listens to the people and they say that that's what we want to do.

302
00:17:54.630 --> 00:17:56.700
We don't want to take a step towards Russia.

303
00:17:56.701 --> 00:18:00.870
We want to become part of the European Union.
We want to have a future here.
Like,

304
00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:06.210
um,
what we see going on in western Europe and all of the fucking politicians go,

305
00:18:06.211 --> 00:18:10.380
you got it.
All right.
The people have spoken.
We're going to do what you said.

306
00:18:10.950 --> 00:18:13.430
And what do you think happened?
Right?
In the midnight hour they gave him,

307
00:18:13.530 --> 00:18:15.580
they all right.
They have Fred.
They're like,
yeah,
you know what,

308
00:18:15.710 --> 00:18:19.320
when not signed to that,
and,
uh,
we've been go hang out with though.

309
00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:23.460
Vladi daddy over there.
Putin,
Vladimir Putin,
and,
and uh,

310
00:18:23.490 --> 00:18:26.670
we're going to fucking shoot 18 holes of golf with him and we're going to sell

311
00:18:26.671 --> 00:18:29.910
out your country to the risky.
So

312
00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:34.110
started off this whole fucking revolution.
I'm not going to say what the fuck.

313
00:18:34.111 --> 00:18:39.060
I mean,
you gotta watch it.
It's unbelievable.
But um,
you know,

314
00:18:39.690 --> 00:18:41.970
I mean,
it's not like it's not in the news.
I mean,
they ended up winning.

315
00:18:42.150 --> 00:18:45.180
They somehow ended up winning and these,
these fucking people had no weapons.

316
00:18:45.181 --> 00:18:49.860
They were just getting shot at what,
when I don't understand.
I mean,

317
00:18:49.861 --> 00:18:54.840
I do understand it,
but I,
I,
there's no place in the world where you can protest.

318
00:18:55.980 --> 00:18:57.690
You can't do it.
You protest,

319
00:18:57.960 --> 00:19:02.190
cops show up and they beat the fuck out of you until you go home and they

320
00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:05.430
arrested a few and then that's it.
Everyone,
it happens in this country,

321
00:19:05.431 --> 00:19:09.190
this country with all its own would have free brave freedom of speech.

322
00:19:09.730 --> 00:19:14.050
You know those fucking occupy Wall Street people,
right?

323
00:19:14.051 --> 00:19:16.180
They come down there,
they beat the fuck out of them.

324
00:19:16.181 --> 00:19:19.300
And everybody knows the old trick,
the same shit that they was,

325
00:19:19.330 --> 00:19:22.120
they were claiming they did it in the Ukraine where it basically,

326
00:19:22.510 --> 00:19:25.390
when you have a peaceful demonstration,
it's like,
well fuck,

327
00:19:25.391 --> 00:19:27.520
we can't beat the fuck out of him.
What should we do?

328
00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:31.660
They hire a couple people to go down there and pretend to be the protesters.

329
00:19:31.661 --> 00:19:36.490
They throw a couple of fucking rocks and then the,
the,
the,
the cops go nuts.

330
00:19:36.580 --> 00:19:38.050
And then on the news they're like,
ah,

331
00:19:38.051 --> 00:19:40.930
the protesters started attacking the police.
You know,

332
00:19:40.931 --> 00:19:43.560
the police were just doing their job,
but bla bla bla bla.

333
00:19:43.570 --> 00:19:46.480
The police's job is to go down there and beat the fuck out of him.
Right.

334
00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:50.970
Isn't it?
Isn't that what it is that Jesus Christ built?
I Dunno.
Pill.
What?

335
00:19:50.980 --> 00:19:53.980
What do you know?
I don't know.
That's,
that's kind of what I got out of it.

336
00:19:53.981 --> 00:19:55.220
I got out of it that,
um,

337
00:19:55.750 --> 00:20:00.400
it was an amazing documentary that these people actually with basically no

338
00:20:00.401 --> 00:20:04.360
fucking weapons and just,
you know,
died,

339
00:20:04.390 --> 00:20:08.170
lost their eyes,
had all these horrific fucking injuries.
Got Kidnapped,

340
00:20:08.171 --> 00:20:12.990
disappeared,
all of this horrific shit,
and they were able to,

341
00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:15.970
um,
hold them off for a while.

342
00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:19.900
So then the fucking Russian guy ends up having to leave,
right?

343
00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:22.090
He fucking leaves.
And then the AA,

344
00:20:23.780 --> 00:20:27.640
Aa is a jolly good fellow.
It's all fucking over.
And then all of a sudden,

345
00:20:27.641 --> 00:20:29.870
out of nowhere,
this,

346
00:20:30.130 --> 00:20:33.190
this other revolution starts with people who are pro Russia.

347
00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:37.420
So once again,

348
00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:42.480
all they did was they just had Russian troops pretend to be Ukrainians and say,

349
00:20:42.791 --> 00:20:46.600
wait a minute,
we don't want to be free.

350
00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:50.570
We to be oppressed.
Right?
So now I guess they got a fight,
that thing.

351
00:20:50.710 --> 00:20:53.650
And since then,
since the document you'd been made,

352
00:20:53.651 --> 00:20:57.520
like 6,000 Ukrainian people died.
But um,
well,
I,

353
00:20:57.570 --> 00:20:59.170
I don't understand why a,

354
00:21:00.420 --> 00:21:00.600
<v 3>yeah,</v>

355
00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:02.760
<v 0>if you just look at the United States of America,</v>

356
00:21:03.030 --> 00:21:06.570
the amount of money you can still make,

357
00:21:06.930 --> 00:21:08.310
if you're up on top,

358
00:21:08.610 --> 00:21:12.960
the amount of taxes you can get out of paying the amount of parks that you can

359
00:21:12.961 --> 00:21:16.350
fucking have and just pass it onto the middle class.

360
00:21:16.740 --> 00:21:18.180
I don't understand why,

361
00:21:19.410 --> 00:21:23.520
like why Russia still does the whole fucking a dictated thing or why any country

362
00:21:23.521 --> 00:21:27.930
does just set it up the way we set it up.
You pretend that people,
you know,

363
00:21:27.931 --> 00:21:32.190
you give them,
you know,
you let them be as free as they could be,

364
00:21:33.210 --> 00:21:35.660
you know?
Yeah.
You do the whole rhetoric and the end,

365
00:21:35.670 --> 00:21:39.750
but basically there is still a ruling class and you don't have to pay your fair

366
00:21:39.751 --> 00:21:43.410
share and all that fucking shady works out and we know you're doing it.

367
00:21:43.411 --> 00:21:46.200
But as long as you know,
you let us drive down the street and the convertible,

368
00:21:47.470 --> 00:21:48.303
<v 3>you know,</v>

369
00:21:49.570 --> 00:21:53.260
<v 0>listening to some tunes,
man,
I mean,
somebody's got to run it.</v>

370
00:21:54.010 --> 00:21:55.390
I don't want to fucking do that shit.

371
00:21:56.470 --> 00:21:57.303
<v 3>You know,</v>

372
00:21:58.300 --> 00:22:01.030
<v 0>all of a sudden make decisions.
I don't even like run in my own website.</v>

373
00:22:01.150 --> 00:22:03.730
There's no fucking way I could be sitting there making decisions for an a whole

374
00:22:03.731 --> 00:22:06.040
goddamn country.
I don't want to do that.

375
00:22:07.420 --> 00:22:08.010
<v 3>Okay.</v>

376
00:22:08.010 --> 00:22:09.820
<v 0>You know what,
uh,
what the,
what are the,
what is,</v>

377
00:22:09.821 --> 00:22:14.460
what does that like every fucking day waking up and not a God damn problem.

378
00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:16.650
That's why I think things such why you can't have a dictator.

379
00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:18.450
That's why they're all so brutally mean.

380
00:22:19.290 --> 00:22:21.360
After a while they just get sick of answering questions.
Why?

381
00:22:21.361 --> 00:22:24.270
What's the problem where I have just fucking shoot him.
All right.
I don't,

382
00:22:24.271 --> 00:22:28.540
I don't care.
I said fucking shovel up the rest up.

383
00:22:28.670 --> 00:22:29.640
What am a jail?

384
00:22:31.070 --> 00:22:31.320
<v 3>Okay.</v>

385
00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:34.750
<v 0>Fuck.
I've got to do everything around here,
chicken here and about it.</v>

386
00:22:36.690 --> 00:22:41.430
Um,
anyways,
so if you get a chance,
I'll try to say here is,

387
00:22:41.431 --> 00:22:46.110
if you get a chance to check out a Ukraine winter on fire and um,

388
00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:51.090
I dunno,
I,
I should really start paying attention to politics more,
but I,

389
00:22:51.750 --> 00:22:56.100
I just think it's all bullshit.
I can't,
I can't sit there and listen to it.

390
00:22:56.101 --> 00:22:57.930
I start screaming at the fucking TV.

391
00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:00.773
<v 3>MMM.</v>

392
00:23:01.310 --> 00:23:03.650
<v 0>And I get all fucking upset.
So why would I do that?</v>

393
00:23:03.651 --> 00:23:08.090
And then I ended up with three fucking options,
none of which I want.
You know,

394
00:23:08.570 --> 00:23:11.990
I do have to tell you,
watching all fat boy,
they're from New Jersey,
Jesus Christ.

395
00:23:12.260 --> 00:23:15.080
The look on his face when he was fucking listening to Donald Trump.

396
00:23:15.081 --> 00:23:18.770
That was the funniest fucking shit ever.
That looks like a shotgun wedding.

397
00:23:22.550 --> 00:23:25.160
It all he was thinking is that I'm fucking fuck do I get it?

398
00:23:25.161 --> 00:23:29.480
I get myself into this.
How do I get out of this it?
Oh

399
00:23:31.130 --> 00:23:35.990
yeah,
Jesus Christ.
How much did he fucking binge eat that night?

400
00:23:37.250 --> 00:23:39.200
Poor guy.
That's really bad.
It's gotta be,

401
00:23:39.201 --> 00:23:41.870
you know what sucks about being fat is people just know it.
You know,

402
00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:44.990
you can't hide that shit and just boom,
they just fucking right on it.

403
00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:49.340
You know what?
Me All,
I guess we,
I'm a baldheaded motherfucker,
so I got that now.

404
00:23:49.340 --> 00:23:54.290
But when I was younger,
well then I had orange hair orange then turned red.
Yeah.

405
00:23:54.291 --> 00:23:57.500
You know,
I kind of got shit the whole time,
you know,
if I really look back at it,

406
00:23:58.100 --> 00:24:02.240
um,
all right.
Save you just some regular brown hair.
Brunette fucking,
you know,

407
00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:07.710
I'm just,
you know,
when you think about Chinese people,
right?
Cause they don't,

408
00:24:07.711 --> 00:24:12.270
they are there any red headed,
like naturally redheaded,
naturally aspirated.

409
00:24:12.900 --> 00:24:14.910
Um,
Chinese people hang on a second here.

410
00:24:15.810 --> 00:24:19.620
Natural red head,

411
00:24:20.430 --> 00:24:21.390
Chinese

412
00:24:23.050 --> 00:24:26.830
nine natural redheads from different backgrounds.
The forever war.

413
00:24:26.831 --> 00:24:30.880
Why a Chinese girl has red hair?
Well,

414
00:24:30.881 --> 00:24:34.000
because there was a fucking military base nearby,
I would think.

415
00:24:36.210 --> 00:24:39.380
All right.
The forever war.
Why a Chinese girl has red hair.

416
00:24:39.740 --> 00:24:44.740
When you zoom out of history to the level where empires rise and fall and people

417
00:24:44.751 --> 00:24:47.630
migrate,
conquer,
collapse and absorb and disappear,

418
00:24:47.631 --> 00:24:49.870
you find that the story is always the same.

419
00:24:50.420 --> 00:24:52.550
<v 3>That what</v>

420
00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:56.400
<v 0>the tall stock tie stock.</v>

421
00:24:57.150 --> 00:25:01.770
The original stock is light non black hair.
Non Brown eyes.

422
00:25:01.830 --> 00:25:02.790
Fair skin.

423
00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:04.870
<v 3>Okay.</v>

424
00:25:04.870 --> 00:25:08.830
<v 0>Where am I on a racist website?
Don't fuck.
Am I reading here?</v>

425
00:25:11.430 --> 00:25:12.263
<v 3>MMM.</v>

426
00:25:12.810 --> 00:25:17.420
<v 0>The others are darker.
The others are weaker but breed faster up.
There we go.</v>

427
00:25:17.550 --> 00:25:21.360
Yeah.
I saw the red flags.
The fuck is the name of this website.

428
00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:26.600
Kalanik soul life to the neanderthal death to the void.

429
00:25:27.610 --> 00:25:28.443
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

430
00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:32.230
<v 0>Christus rex.
The forever war.
Why a Chinese girl has red hair.</v>

431
00:25:34.210 --> 00:25:35.043
<v 3>Oh God.</v>

432
00:25:36.900 --> 00:25:39.220
<v 0>Fucking Internet is amazing and I just affected his,</v>

433
00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:41.830
gives every clued me just punch a fucking dopes.

434
00:25:43.350 --> 00:25:46.110
Why are blonde and red hair clothes not seen?

435
00:25:46.590 --> 00:25:48.630
Can an Asian and a natural redhead?

436
00:25:48.631 --> 00:25:51.630
If I have a redheaded Asian look at this shit,

437
00:25:51.631 --> 00:25:56.430
the redheaded Chinese girl,
Asian red hair on Pinterest,

438
00:25:59.940 --> 00:26:02.060
the world's first Asian redheads.

439
00:26:02.070 --> 00:26:04.050
So I'm going to go out on a limb and say that they don't really don't have any

440
00:26:04.530 --> 00:26:06.240
blondes or any of that type of shit.
So I was just thinking,

441
00:26:06.450 --> 00:26:10.920
do you think that people get less shit?
Like what are you get bullied for

442
00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:16.040
in,
uh,
in China?
Oh God,

443
00:26:16.041 --> 00:26:18.440
please let there be some fucking native Chinese people.
Listen to this.

444
00:26:18.441 --> 00:26:18.920
What are the,

445
00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:23.920
give me the top fucking 10 reasons that Chinese people get bullied in China.

446
00:26:26.790 --> 00:26:29.730
It's probably a usual shit economic that's going to be looks right.

447
00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:32.580
There's always going to be better looking mediocre.

448
00:26:32.581 --> 00:26:35.220
And then there was always going to be some poor bastard coming down the street.

449
00:26:35.221 --> 00:26:36.970
You know,
some fucking happen.
I don't know,

450
00:26:38.070 --> 00:26:40.680
something that's going on with his nose,
his fucking ears.
There's a there,

451
00:26:40.681 --> 00:26:44.310
the kids,
they'll,
they'll,
they'll find something you,
but you would think,

452
00:26:44.311 --> 00:26:47.580
you know,
if everybody just had the fucking jet black hair,

453
00:26:47.730 --> 00:26:50.430
and maybe I'm more overly sensitive to this because I just came,
you know,

454
00:26:50.431 --> 00:26:53.730
I came on,
I came to the world with a bullseye.
Right,
right there.
There you go.

455
00:26:54.090 --> 00:26:56.940
What the fuck is that?
Get it right.

456
00:27:01.010 --> 00:27:01.843
<v 4>MMM.</v>

457
00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:04.940
<v 0>This has been a fucking crazy podcast,
huh?
I don't,</v>

458
00:27:04.941 --> 00:27:06.470
and I don't have any advertising yet.
I,

459
00:27:06.471 --> 00:27:09.200
this is usually the time that I tap out and I started fucking reading,

460
00:27:09.201 --> 00:27:12.560
but it hasn't come in yet.
It has not come in yet.
Let me see.

461
00:27:12.561 --> 00:27:14.000
I'll look it up right now.
See if I got it.

462
00:27:16.380 --> 00:27:19.210
Why do I only have 50 fucking windows open now?

463
00:27:19.211 --> 00:27:23.120
I got a French book here that I was reading.
I wasn't reading,

464
00:27:23.121 --> 00:27:25.890
I was listening to it.
There's a book,

465
00:27:25.891 --> 00:27:28.050
something about a wolf that wanted to change its colors.

466
00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:32.850
I've gone 15 or 16 straight days on a duo.

467
00:27:32.851 --> 00:27:37.170
Lingo asked me to say something in French.
I can't really,
but you know what?

468
00:27:37.171 --> 00:27:38.340
I can read it pretty well.

469
00:27:39.980 --> 00:27:40.813
<v 4>MMM.</v>

470
00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:47.970
<v 0>For,
I know that that means for children.
Poor on false children.
All right.</v>

471
00:27:47.971 --> 00:27:50.130
What am I doing?
I'm on completely losing my train of thought here.

472
00:27:52.700 --> 00:27:55.370
Oh fuck you.
Something.
There's a window.
This is the amount of shit.

473
00:27:55.371 --> 00:27:59.180
I look out one window.
I have French school books.
All right.

474
00:27:59.181 --> 00:28:04.181
And then the next window I have critical engine opened up on a Wikipedia.

475
00:28:05.330 --> 00:28:09.080
I was talking to Paul Versey cause we're doing this tour and I was saying like,

476
00:28:09.081 --> 00:28:09.291
all right,

477
00:28:09.291 --> 00:28:13.490
these are going to be like four or five hour drives or we could rent a small

478
00:28:13.491 --> 00:28:17.330
plane but it's going to be maybe two to sin Paul's music.
Oh,
I know.
I like,

479
00:28:17.420 --> 00:28:19.490
I like small planes starts freaking the fuck out,
right?

480
00:28:20.390 --> 00:28:23.090
Like small planes sticking.
It's like a Chevy Chevette some piece of shit.

481
00:28:23.091 --> 00:28:25.200
Like it's not just going to die.
And I was saying like,
dude,

482
00:28:25.300 --> 00:28:29.030
there's going to be a dual engine.
We're going to be fucking fine.
Uh,

483
00:28:29.220 --> 00:28:29.840
you got two engines.

484
00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:32.600
It to the odds are them both fucking failing at the same time and one of them

485
00:28:32.601 --> 00:28:35.330
can still fly the plane.
You find this is what I believed.

486
00:28:35.630 --> 00:28:37.760
But then I started looking it up cause I was trying to give them some

487
00:28:37.761 --> 00:28:41.380
information.
I was saying like,
look,
I mean I don't know 100% know this ship,

488
00:28:41.470 --> 00:28:44.920
but this is what I've basically been told.
And a,

489
00:28:44.930 --> 00:28:48.470
I started looking it up and evidently,
uh,

490
00:28:48.500 --> 00:28:51.470
one engine for the most part is more critical than the other.

491
00:28:52.460 --> 00:28:54.980
And also when one engine goes out,

492
00:28:55.400 --> 00:28:59.060
it isn't like he just keep flying at normally.
Whoa.
You know,
we still got one.

493
00:28:59.061 --> 00:29:03.070
We're good like that.
Obviously,
you know,

494
00:29:03.530 --> 00:29:06.800
it fucks with the not the balance.
What would it be?

495
00:29:06.830 --> 00:29:10.460
I don't know how to say it scientifically.
It's not a jet engine.

496
00:29:10.460 --> 00:29:14.540
So there's no like thrust is there
of Jesus Christ.

497
00:29:14.541 --> 00:29:16.940
Can you believe I have a pilot's license?
Fucking,
I believe art.
Um,

498
00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:18.320
let's read this here.
Uh,

499
00:29:18.321 --> 00:29:22.640
the critical engine of a multi engine fixed wing aircraft is the engines whose

500
00:29:22.641 --> 00:29:27.500
failure would most adversely affect the performance or handling abilities of an

501
00:29:27.501 --> 00:29:29.870
aircraft on propeller aircraft.

502
00:29:29.871 --> 00:29:33.890
There is a difference in the remaining young and that's just the nose going

503
00:29:33.891 --> 00:29:38.270
right to left moments after failure of the left or the right outboard engine.

504
00:29:38.271 --> 00:29:42.970
When all propellers rotate in the same due to the p factor.

505
00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:46.330
And I was like,
what the fuck is the p factor?

506
00:29:46.380 --> 00:29:48.970
And it has something to do with like when you're flying straight and level

507
00:29:48.971 --> 00:29:53.110
flight,
okay.
Your propeller blades are um,

508
00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:57.550
you know,
they're there.
Uh,
you have the angle of attack with the wind.

509
00:29:57.700 --> 00:29:58.960
It's basically coming straight.

510
00:29:58.961 --> 00:30:01.480
You're perpendicular to the angle of attack of the wind.

511
00:30:01.750 --> 00:30:05.440
That way you are getting the most bang for your buck with,

512
00:30:05.610 --> 00:30:07.930
for the work that the engine is doing with the propellers.

513
00:30:08.110 --> 00:30:12.730
But the more you angle nose up or nose down,
the more the wind,

514
00:30:12.731 --> 00:30:16.280
the way it's hitting.
It affects the performance is what I sorta belief.

515
00:30:17.350 --> 00:30:20.710
I've got all this Mumbo jumbo in my fucking head.
I have no idea.
But I had no,

516
00:30:20.910 --> 00:30:24.730
so I started reading more about this and there's all these fucking debates.

517
00:30:26.020 --> 00:30:26.441
You know,

518
00:30:26.441 --> 00:30:31.060
I was always of the belief that if you had two engines,

519
00:30:31.210 --> 00:30:32.620
if you could afford to engines,

520
00:30:32.950 --> 00:30:37.780
you buy that fucking airplane because you know,

521
00:30:37.781 --> 00:30:40.390
the engines run independently.
So you've got to fucking engines.

522
00:30:40.391 --> 00:30:41.830
What are the odds of both of them?

523
00:30:41.831 --> 00:30:46.720
One fails and then the other one fucking fails,
you know,
but it's,

524
00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:51.520
it's so it's gotta be almost zero.
However,
there's all these that I could,

525
00:30:51.521 --> 00:30:51.710
you know,

526
00:30:51.710 --> 00:30:56.710
something I started to read about it and there was all these debates where at

527
00:30:57.911 --> 00:31:01.840
first it was obviously believed that yeah,
more engines is better,
it's safer.

528
00:31:02.020 --> 00:31:05.530
And then somewhere along the line somebody did a study and saw that more fatal

529
00:31:05.531 --> 00:31:06.590
action,
uh,

530
00:31:07.150 --> 00:31:11.110
accessing more fatal accidents happened in dual engine aircraft.

531
00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:15.730
And people going like,
oh,
and then so maybe a single is better.

532
00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:17.560
And then that person came back and was like,
no,

533
00:31:17.561 --> 00:31:21.880
you weren't hearing what I was trying to say.
I was actually saying it was safe.

534
00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:25.900
And then it doubled back on itself and I have no fucking clue what is safe.

535
00:31:25.901 --> 00:31:30.901
But what I did learn in it in a very layman kind of way was I had no idea that,

536
00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:35.650
um,
I mean it does make sense if you just have one side working,

537
00:31:36.430 --> 00:31:40.060
you know that it'd be sort of pulling that side along of the aircraft more so

538
00:31:40.061 --> 00:31:42.990
than the other one causing the other one.
The drag.
And I,
you'd have to,
I dunno,

539
00:31:43.820 --> 00:31:46.450
crab your way into the fucking wind.
I have no idea.

540
00:31:47.920 --> 00:31:50.800
But all I know is I was reading it says if one of your engines dies and the

541
00:31:50.801 --> 00:31:53.530
other one's still going,
you obviously have a much,

542
00:31:53.650 --> 00:31:56.350
they said a much better chance of making it to the airport.

543
00:31:56.351 --> 00:31:59.770
They didn't say you would make it though.
And a witch.

544
00:31:59.830 --> 00:32:03.850
Here's my question to anybody out there who might know this shit

545
00:32:05.590 --> 00:32:08.290
on,
uh,
on your average twin engine airplane,

546
00:32:10.180 --> 00:32:14.530
can boat both engines independently fly the airplane?

547
00:32:15.940 --> 00:32:20.680
You know what I mean?
With one quit.
Do they both have the ability to,

548
00:32:21.320 --> 00:32:26.080
uh,
basically gets you,

549
00:32:26.110 --> 00:32:30.130
have you flying fast enough where you can still maintain lift,

550
00:32:31.900 --> 00:32:34.030
you know,
cause then I was then thinking like,
okay,

551
00:32:34.031 --> 00:32:36.970
well if they went from one to two engines,
you know,

552
00:32:36.971 --> 00:32:38.860
you're adding more weight to the aircraft.

553
00:32:39.020 --> 00:32:42.590
Like as you'd build a bigger fucking plane.
Sorry,

554
00:32:42.591 --> 00:32:45.110
I'm trying to do this math in my head.
You build a bigger fucking plane.

555
00:32:45.111 --> 00:32:49.850
But my thing is is do they then go all because of certain aircraft?

556
00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:51.560
Because it's a cheaper twin engine.

557
00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:57.160
It's the both engines in unison have enough power so you can maintain lift.

558
00:32:59.361 --> 00:33:00.740
But if you lose one of them,

559
00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:05.210
the other one can still give you the hundred percent of the lifts that you need.

560
00:33:05.211 --> 00:33:07.130
You actually only have like 60%.

561
00:33:07.430 --> 00:33:11.300
If you still have the critical engine or only 40% of the critical one goes out.

562
00:33:11.301 --> 00:33:14.420
Like I have no idea how that works.
All I know is it scared the fuck out of me.

563
00:33:14.840 --> 00:33:18.640
That's all I can tell you.
Um,
all right.

564
00:33:19.060 --> 00:33:21.350
Is it an amazing the amount of topics I can talk about that.

565

567
00:33:28.611 --> 00:33:31.400
I guess now I'm just going to say that I'm going to stop here and read some

568
00:33:31.401 --> 00:33:35.210
advertising.
I don't have it,
but a,

579
00:34:11.031 --> 00:34:14.840
one reason is because they deliver amazing razors right to your door for a third

580
00:34:14.841 --> 00:34:17.660
of the price of what those greedy cut razor corporations charge.

581
00:34:17.840 --> 00:34:19.550
That means when you joined dollar Shave Club,

582

585
00:34:28.941 --> 00:34:33.930
your wallet.
Another reason is their doctor cavities easier.
Uh,

586
00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:35.900
using it with the executive,
uh,

587

Don't do that.

589
00:34:44.360 --> 00:34:49.360
Nobody at fucking Skin Shave Dollar Shave Club is saying to fucking do that.

590
00:34:49.970 --> 00:34:54.400
That was a joke.

Drop your razor and wash the coffee.

591
00:34:54.410 --> 00:34:58.280
Shave butter off of your ball bag.

All right,
back to the ED.

592
00:34:59.450 --> 00:35:03.560

Are Old friends are back headspace,
man.

601
00:35:36.690 --> 00:35:41.160
Um,
let's honest,
most of you,
most of your problems start with your mind.
Jesus.

602
00:35:41.161 --> 00:35:44.640
I know mine.
Do fear,
anger,
stress,
anxiety,

603
00:35:44.641 --> 00:35:46.770
depression and sleeplessness and freckles.

604
00:35:47.190 --> 00:35:51.690

I will,
I always do.

606
00:35:57.280 --> 00:35:58.330
Um,
but it doesn't have to be that way.

607
00:35:58.331 --> 00:36:00.640
You can make a major difference in just 10 minutes a day.

608
00:36:00.850 --> 00:36:05.850
This change comes through through guided meditation with the new headspace APP.

computer or tablet.

612
00:36:19.140 --> 00:36:22.200
Beditation is rooted in thousands of years of tradition and we've boiled,

613
00:36:22.380 --> 00:36:27.150
we've boiled it down to an APP that we hope a bigger corporation will someday by

614
00:36:27.150 --> 00:36:30.150
.
So we came,
we can take the money,

I wouldn't be funny anymore and I'd become homeless,
but God damn it.

I with lame sesame,

radishes,
feral far.
Oh fuck.
Oh,

681

686
00:40:32.141 --> 00:40:36.410

And then you go back to them podcasts yet.

687
00:40:36.840 --> 00:40:41.510
Cons in the future.
All right.
Um,
oh,

688
00:40:41.511 --> 00:40:44.510
I didn't even finish the fucking,
I'm back.
We're back after the advertising.

689
00:40:44.511 --> 00:40:48.440
We are back I guess.
Did I read it then?
I sound good.
How much did I stumble?

690
00:40:48.710 --> 00:40:50.540
I never even finished the frying Pan Story.

691
00:40:50.660 --> 00:40:53.810
So I get all the way down to the fucking frying pan thing.
All right.

692
00:40:54.440 --> 00:40:56.780
And we already have like the regular whatever,
a 10 inch one.

693
00:40:56.930 --> 00:40:59.120
So I want to buy the eight inch one that matches.

694
00:40:59.121 --> 00:41:01.940
And of course the only way to do that is that to buy the whole fucking set.

695
00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:03.150
<v 3>Okay.</v>

696
00:41:03.150 --> 00:41:05.850
<v 0>You know,
and I was just like,
you know what?
Fuck you.</v>

697
00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:08.550
And I bought one of those little pasta cutter thinks and that was it.

698
00:41:08.551 --> 00:41:10.890
And I fucking left and I couldn't for the life of me could understand.

699
00:41:11.040 --> 00:41:13.620
One of them was nine 95 the other one was 21 bucks.

700
00:41:13.621 --> 00:41:15.660
And I sat there for 10 minutes holding both of them,

701
00:41:16.240 --> 00:41:18.030
trying to see like what does it handle better?

702
00:41:18.900 --> 00:41:23.890
How is this one more than twice the price?
I Dunno.

703
00:41:23.900 --> 00:41:26.360
Bill,
why would you think it's interesting to us?
I don't know.

704
00:41:26.600 --> 00:41:30.050
Trying to fill up a fucking hour here.
Um,

706
00:41:33.140 --> 00:41:37.850
do have some dates and I will never again announced cities,
um,
that I,

707
00:41:37.851 --> 00:41:40.670
that I'm saying,
you know,
we're working on it.
I'm never going to do that again.

708
00:41:40.671 --> 00:41:41.121
Like I said,

709
00:41:41.121 --> 00:41:45.260
what I said with buffalo and fucking Syracuse because that hasn't worked out
yet.

710
00:41:45.261 --> 00:41:47.570
Now everybody's like,
dude,
what the fuck you said you will come in there.

711
00:41:47.990 --> 00:41:51.860
I shouldn't open my big Yap.
All right.
Um,

712
00:41:51.861 --> 00:41:54.260
I am coming to Albany.
I do know that.

713
00:41:55.190 --> 00:41:59.300
So people in Buffalo,
like,
dude,
that's like a four hour fucking drive.
I know,

714
00:41:59.570 --> 00:42:03.830
I know.
I'm sorry.
All right,
I'll,
I'll,
I'll figure something out.
All right,

715
00:42:03.831 --> 00:42:08.330
here we go on match 25th.
I'm in Riverside,
California,

716
00:42:09.650 --> 00:42:10.161
Riverside,

717
00:42:10.161 --> 00:42:14.180
which I believe is the beginning of the inland empire or maybe it isn't.

718
00:42:14.181 --> 00:42:17.870
I have no idea.
Um,
on the 26th,

719
00:42:17.900 --> 00:42:20.480
I'm at the terrorist theatre in Long Beach,
California.

720
00:42:20.540 --> 00:42:25.010
Unbelievable honor to be playing in a place that is the place who Richard Pryor

721
00:42:25.040 --> 00:42:27.980
taped live in concert where he had the red shirt,

722
00:42:27.981 --> 00:42:31.610
the black pants in the silver shoes.
I will be standing on that stage.

723
00:42:31.611 --> 00:42:34.880
I'm sure they redid it since he's been there,
you know,

724
00:42:34.881 --> 00:42:37.180
so I won't be standing on the exact same floorboards,

725
00:42:37.220 --> 00:42:39.140
but I will be within the same structure.

726
00:42:39.270 --> 00:42:44.270
I'd be standing in the same place where he did stand up comedy to me,

727
00:42:44.330 --> 00:42:49.330
the greatest standup comedian of all time on the 22nd of April.

728
00:42:50.631 --> 00:42:53.280
I will be in Saint Louis.
Uh,

729
00:42:53.281 --> 00:42:56.960
the Oh it go y'all on the 24th.

730
00:42:58.430 --> 00:43:02.060
He's a great ones.
I will be in Iowa in Ames,
Iowa,

731
00:43:02.990 --> 00:43:06.590
22nd St Louis,
Missouri and the 24th.
I'll be in ames,
Iowa.

732
00:43:06.591 --> 00:43:11.591
I have not been an ios since I did the rich bitch tour way back in 2004.

733
00:43:15.020 --> 00:43:16.220
Um,
speaking of which did anybody's think?

734
00:43:16.221 --> 00:43:18.140
One of the guys that did the tour with Donnell Rawlings?

735
00:43:18.141 --> 00:43:22.430
Did you see that TMZ video?
The guy's getting breakfast.

736
00:43:22.600 --> 00:43:25.400
He's got a $12 check.
He goes outside to have a cigarette.

737
00:43:25.401 --> 00:43:29.300
He leaves his bag inside and all of a sudden they came running out in Philly

738
00:43:29.990 --> 00:43:31.570
screaming and I'm thinking he was,

739
00:43:31.610 --> 00:43:36.380
he was dining and dashing showing it as we used to call it in Boston.

740
00:43:37.220 --> 00:43:40.390
You know what I mean?
Fucking unbelievable.
Unbelievably.

741
00:43:40.400 --> 00:43:43.550
Ends up getting in a big fucking fight knowledge,
and he's got his bag and side.

742
00:43:43.551 --> 00:43:44.660
They won't give it to him.

743
00:43:46.460 --> 00:43:47.293
<v 4>MMM.</v>

744
00:43:47.380 --> 00:43:49.490
<v 0>According to this shit that I read,
I was just fucking,
I believe,</v>

745
00:43:49.600 --> 00:43:51.820
and I can tell you that as a white guy,
that would not happen to me.

746
00:43:52.600 --> 00:43:57.520
That would not happen to me.
Um,
that was,
that was fucked up.

747
00:43:58.180 --> 00:44:01.030
Definitely fucked up.
And uh,
you know what?
It didn't happen in Boston.
All right.

748
00:44:01.031 --> 00:44:05.230
All you fucking haters that happened in Philly,
say it's all around.

749
00:44:06.710 --> 00:44:07.543
<v 4>MMM.</v>

750
00:44:08.080 --> 00:44:10.600
<v 0>You know,
it was funny.
Donald threw that punch in.
The dude caught it.</v>

751
00:44:14.410 --> 00:44:16.780
The next time I see him,
I'm going to tease him about that.

752
00:44:16.781 --> 00:44:20.650
I wouldn't do it now because it's fucking fresh and it was bullshit.
I can,

753
00:44:20.680 --> 00:44:23.260
I can definitely tell you as a white dude,
uh,
that you know,

754
00:44:23.261 --> 00:44:24.640
that not would not have happened to me.

755
00:44:24.641 --> 00:44:28.750
That's a complete racial profiling incident.
Put it was dead fucking dude.

756
00:44:28.751 --> 00:44:32.850
Lean back and just caught it.
You know,
you ever see a pitcher?

757
00:44:32.851 --> 00:44:35.850
Just catch a fucking one that comes right back to the mound.
He did that.

758
00:44:35.851 --> 00:44:40.320
But with Don Ellis fist,
um,
anyways,
uh,

759
00:44:40.350 --> 00:44:44.700
plowing ahead.
Uh,
May 7th,
Orlando,
Florida,

760
00:44:44.910 --> 00:44:48.900
May 8th.
I'll be in Jacksonville,
Florida.

761
00:44:49.770 --> 00:44:54.600
And a clear,
what are you staring at me for?
Once the matter.

762
00:44:56.060 --> 00:44:58.320
I'm not,
I already gave you fod,

763
00:44:58.370 --> 00:45:01.910
so let me look at me like that and I already took you out.
Um,

764
00:45:02.350 --> 00:45:05.840
well you just want attention buddy.
You're getting lonely over there,

765
00:45:07.200 --> 00:45:10.460
<v 3>Huh?
All right.</v>

766
00:45:11.320 --> 00:45:14.200
<v 0>Fucking dog is so needy.
All right.
Portland May,</v>

767
00:45:17.980 --> 00:45:21.430
June 4th,
2016 I'll be there.
Uh,
and I also know I,
in the early April,

768
00:45:21.431 --> 00:45:25.510
I got a bunch of Canadian dates.
Uh,
they're all up on my website.

769
00:45:25.900 --> 00:45:30.220
[inaudible] DOT com.
Um,
so anyway,
speaking of dogs,

770
00:45:31.480 --> 00:45:33.820
I kind of tweeted about this shit where,
um,
you know what?

771
00:45:33.821 --> 00:45:36.910
The fucking dog I have the biggest problem with like their owners never have

772
00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:38.830
them under control.
I'm not blaming the breed here,

773
00:45:38.831 --> 00:45:42.900
but there's just something about the fucking the owners and how hyper the dog is

774
00:45:42.900 --> 00:45:46.270
,
is those fucking giant portals.
There was another one today.

775
00:45:46.271 --> 00:45:50.140
I was at the supermarket in this person that tied it up outside and it's just

776
00:45:50.141 --> 00:45:53.290
literally outside the fucking supermarket the whole time.

777
00:45:53.690 --> 00:45:57.560
<v 5>Wow.
Wow.
Wow,</v>

778
00:45:58.940 --> 00:45:59.773
wow.

779
00:46:00.110 --> 00:46:03.530
<v 0>We just would not stop.
Sorry.
Get my dog all amped up.
Um,</v>

780
00:46:04.370 --> 00:46:09.020
those fucking dogs are insane.
I don't know what the deal is with them,
be they,

781
00:46:09.050 --> 00:46:12.050
I think they are like,
they're kind of like greyhounds.

782
00:46:12.170 --> 00:46:15.230
I'd really just think you need to run them around a fucking track for an hour

783
00:46:15.540 --> 00:46:17.360
everyday just to get them to get it out of their system.

784
00:46:17.780 --> 00:46:19.520
But they got like that perm going on.

785
00:46:19.521 --> 00:46:23.000
So I don't think anybody really thinks it's an issue.
Cleo,
what are you doing?

786
00:46:23.080 --> 00:46:26.540
You're going to distract me on the podcast.
You can't be this adorable right now.

787
00:46:28.660 --> 00:46:30.430
Okay.
For those who don't know anything about pit bulls,

788
00:46:30.460 --> 00:46:35.460
they are like the most needy fucking like love bugs.

789
00:46:35.710 --> 00:46:36.341
They're ridiculous.

790
00:46:36.341 --> 00:46:40.780
Like she just wants to crawl up here in fucking put her head in my lap and go to

791
00:46:40.781 --> 00:46:42.340
sleep.
You know what I mean?

792
00:46:42.341 --> 00:46:46.090
She's not over in the corner of fucking doing some prison workouts,

793
00:46:46.150 --> 00:46:49.990
thinking about,
you know,
people she wants to kill.
And that right buddy.

794
00:46:51.250 --> 00:46:53.500
Now that I've stereotyped giant poodles,

795
00:46:53.830 --> 00:46:57.920
I'm going to try to undo the damage with pit bulls who's getting hit.

796
00:46:57.950 --> 00:47:01.910
My dog would try to rip your face off if he came into the fucking,
um,

797
00:47:02.430 --> 00:47:02.861
and in the house.

798
00:47:02.861 --> 00:47:06.640
She fucking parked at a guy yesterday and I actually loved every second of it.

799
00:47:06.641 --> 00:47:10.600
I was sitting in my Prius on these mean streets of Los Angeles,

800
00:47:11.200 --> 00:47:13.930
downtown Hollywood.
And uh,

801
00:47:13.990 --> 00:47:18.990
some fucking degenerate came up to the window and uh,

802
00:47:20.260 --> 00:47:23.650
I don't know what the fuck he's asking for money or booze or some shit.

803
00:47:24.740 --> 00:47:28.360
And my dog just fucking flipped out,
flipped out,

804
00:47:28.440 --> 00:47:30.710
and the guy jumped back and everything was great,
was like,

805
00:47:30.711 --> 00:47:33.060
I have my own security.
Um,

806
00:47:33.100 --> 00:47:37.810
and the guy was such a fucking alkie deep backed up off the car and then still

807
00:47:37.811 --> 00:47:42.070
mind like,
I want to drink,
I'm trying to get some money for drinks.

808
00:47:46.310 --> 00:47:47.240
I just,
you know,

809
00:47:47.360 --> 00:47:49.700
I told him the beat it every once in a while I'd tell them to beat it.
You know,

810
00:47:49.970 --> 00:47:52.520
there was a one legged homeless guy and he seemed like he was saying,

811
00:47:53.030 --> 00:47:55.430
and he was talking to himself.
Maybe it was a little crazy,

812
00:47:55.431 --> 00:47:58.370
but I will be talking to myself too if I had one fucking leg standing next to a

813
00:47:58.371 --> 00:48:02.360
stop sign.
Right.
What else are you going to do?
There's nobody else there.
So him,

814
00:48:02.361 --> 00:48:03.194
I gave money to

815
00:48:05.310 --> 00:48:07.740
and I was actually joking to myself when I gave him the money and I drove away.

816
00:48:07.741 --> 00:48:10.350
I go,
hi,
there's,
there's my good deed for the day.
Hey,

817
00:48:10.351 --> 00:48:11.850
let's go in and rub and tug.

818
00:48:12.770 --> 00:48:13.603
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

819
00:48:14.680 --> 00:48:15.513
<v 0>rub and tug.</v>

820
00:48:15.680 --> 00:48:18.770
I can't believe fucking people go to those places that don't you worry that the

821
00:48:18.771 --> 00:48:22.280
cops are gonna show up any second.
You know,

822
00:48:22.310 --> 00:48:24.740
you lie in there with the fucking woody,
right?

823
00:48:24.840 --> 00:48:26.720
With a little fucking Woodrow Wilson,
right?

824
00:48:27.710 --> 00:48:31.230
Some girl fucking give you a little handy and all of a sudden everybody get down

825
00:48:31.270 --> 00:48:34.700
on the ground,
you know,
you're like,
oh shit.
Right?
And what are you gonna do?

826
00:48:35.060 --> 00:48:36.020
Say it was legal.

827
00:48:36.160 --> 00:48:39.380
You're not a will that hard on to go away before that fucking dude comes in and

828
00:48:39.381 --> 00:48:44.090
sees you with a half a stiffy,
you know,
I swear to God it hangs like that.

829
00:48:44.390 --> 00:48:48.950
I was in here.
I had a problem with my shoulder,
man,
they're gonna rest you.

830
00:48:49.210 --> 00:48:52.130
Is she a fucking half naked?

831
00:48:53.610 --> 00:48:53.710
<v 2>Okay.</v>

832
00:48:53.710 --> 00:48:56.320
<v 0>Bring it down to the jail.
You're already ready to get fucked.</v>

833
00:48:56.440 --> 00:48:58.630
You don't even have any clothes on that.

834
00:49:00.310 --> 00:49:04.810
He got an oil all over your body.
The fuck is wrong with you.
So anyways,

835
00:49:04.811 --> 00:49:09.340
June 5th,
I'll be in Albany,
New York,
and a June 17th,

836
00:49:09.341 --> 00:49:12.090
I'll be in Noah.
No,

837
00:49:12.300 --> 00:49:15.450
we're fucking New Jersey at the,
uh,

838
00:49:15.480 --> 00:49:18.540
New Jersey fucking performance arts center for the,
uh,

839
00:49:18.541 --> 00:49:21.510
the fucking cock suck is there.
Um,

840
00:49:22.580 --> 00:49:22.890
<v 2>yeah.</v>

841
00:49:22.890 --> 00:49:25.920
<v 0>You don't really make me happy.
The other day I was watching the NHL channel.</v>

842
00:49:26.190 --> 00:49:28.170
Obviously they were talking about how the Bruins could potentially get the

843
00:49:28.171 --> 00:49:31.260
number one seed in the east.
Unfucking believable.

844
00:49:31.680 --> 00:49:35.490
The job that closed Julian has done.
And I'll tell you something right now,

845
00:49:35.491 --> 00:49:36.520
Dan Shaughnessy,

846
00:49:36.600 --> 00:49:39.900
you remember last year when you were calling for his fucking head and saying

847
00:49:39.901 --> 00:49:41.370
maybe he stayed here too long.

848
00:49:41.371 --> 00:49:44.490
You all went on and you should write an apology article.

849
00:49:46.730 --> 00:49:48.680
Unbelievable how these fucking sports writers,

850
00:49:48.681 --> 00:49:51.560
because they got nothing else to write.
We'll,
we'll try to run out,

851
00:49:52.340 --> 00:49:53.173
run out of town,

852
00:49:53.180 --> 00:49:57.740
a fucking coach who brings us our first Stanley Cup and almost 40 fucking years.

853
00:49:58.010 --> 00:50:02.840
Why would you do that?
Jesus fucking Christ.
Why would you do that?
All right,

854
00:50:02.870 --> 00:50:06.500
let's,
uh,
let's read some of the,
uh,
the questions here for this week.

855
00:50:07.790 --> 00:50:11.210
Oh,
we got an update.
I love when there's an update.
Remember last week the,
uh,

856
00:50:11.211 --> 00:50:12.730
the granny fucking are.

857
00:50:14.910 --> 00:50:15.240
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

858
00:50:15.240 --> 00:50:17.700
<v 0>Remember that story all right.
Here we got an update.
Hey,</v>

859
00:50:17.970 --> 00:50:22.830
they're all Billy fucking water.
I got an update for you on this one.

860
00:50:23.450 --> 00:50:26.940
Uh,
the story has good news and bad news.
All right,
so last,
last,

861
00:50:27.200 --> 00:50:29.150
for those of you who didn't listen,
I'll give you a little recap.

862
00:50:29.720 --> 00:50:34.520
There was some kid,
uh,
you know,
he was,
he's basically,
he's engaged,

863
00:50:34.521 --> 00:50:36.020
he's getting married in six weeks,

864
00:50:36.021 --> 00:50:41.021
so he's over his fiance's house as his future in laws house or fucking parents.

865
00:50:42.170 --> 00:50:43.490
That's all I'm trying to say.
Right?

866
00:50:43.880 --> 00:50:48.200
So they're playing some card game and evidently they're down to the final hand

867
00:50:48.201 --> 00:50:52.790
and he has,
uh,
the cards called granny water.

868
00:50:53.180 --> 00:50:55.340
I don't know what the game is or whatever.

869
00:50:55.341 --> 00:50:57.860
Some people sent me pictures of the car at the game does exist,

870
00:50:58.160 --> 00:51:02.390
but it's a really high point card or whatever.
And he was laying down,

871
00:51:03.530 --> 00:51:08.240
oh fuck them yarn and sorry,
he was laying down his car the last,
I basically,

872
00:51:08.241 --> 00:51:11.240
when he laid it down,
he was going to do the old fucking right there.
Fred.

873
00:51:11.270 --> 00:51:13.160
I won the game and uh,

874
00:51:13.220 --> 00:51:15.920
he had the granny water cart and I guess in the end of the game is probably,

875
00:51:15.980 --> 00:51:18.650
you get it,
you hold onto it and you played at a crucial point.

876
00:51:19.030 --> 00:51:21.530
So everybody's sitting there as everybody's laying the cards down,

877
00:51:21.710 --> 00:51:23.720
waiting to see who's going to fucking lay it down.

878
00:51:23.721 --> 00:51:28.460
So this kid fucking finally his turn,
he lays it down to be like,
you know,

879
00:51:28.461 --> 00:51:30.530
like hitting the last second three.
I just won.

880
00:51:30.770 --> 00:51:33.470
And because he listens to the podcast,
instead of saying,

881
00:51:33.471 --> 00:51:37.460
I got the grantee water card,
he goes,
he goes,
look,
he goes,

882
00:51:37.461 --> 00:51:41.300
it's all fucking grant now.
He goes,
it's granny fucking wall.

883
00:51:42.620 --> 00:51:46.430
And just screamed it
to his in laws.

884
00:51:47.300 --> 00:51:51.530
Okay,
who never heard this guy curse before and do not listen to this podcast?

885
00:51:51.531 --> 00:51:55.970
So they just stared at him like,
what?
What was that?

886
00:51:55.970 --> 00:51:57.500
What is my daughter marrying?

887
00:51:57.920 --> 00:52:00.290
Like he just completely screwed the whole fucking thing up.

888
00:52:00.291 --> 00:52:03.800
So he's asking me for advice.
Should he bring it up?
Should he not bring it up?

889
00:52:03.801 --> 00:52:05.480
All right,
now you guys are caught up.
Here you go.

890
00:52:05.690 --> 00:52:08.300
He says the story has good news and bad news.

891
00:52:09.500 --> 00:52:14.230
The good news is my fiance's parents were super cool about the whole things.

892
00:52:16.490 --> 00:52:16.870
Um,
I,

893
00:52:16.870 --> 00:52:21.860
I bit the bullet and waited until we went over for game night again last night.

894
00:52:22.340 --> 00:52:27.050
I apologized,
of course,
and they said,
they initially just thought,

895
00:52:28.660 --> 00:52:30.320
Whoa,
y'all your like this fuck.

896
00:52:30.530 --> 00:52:33.590
They initially thought it was really odd for me to yell like that without

897
00:52:33.591 --> 00:52:38.270
knowing,
without them knowing the context.
But once it was explained,

898
00:52:38.660 --> 00:52:43.430
my fiance texted them about it.
It was no big deal.
It was a huge relief.

899
00:52:43.431 --> 00:52:48.230
We played the game again and every time someone played that car,

900
00:52:48.231 --> 00:52:52.400
they did the whole granny water thing minus the fucking in the middle.

901
00:52:53.450 --> 00:52:58.040
Okay,
cool.
He goes,
so my embarrassment will be immortalized.
Uh,

902
00:52:58.041 --> 00:53:01.970
the bad news is that I mentioned that you read the letter on the podcast.

903
00:53:02.030 --> 00:53:06.740
Oh No.
You know what?
You're one of those guys.

904
00:53:06.940 --> 00:53:10.430
Do you just like you just like stepping and shit.
He goes naturally.

905
00:53:10.431 --> 00:53:11.750
They wanted to listen to it.

906
00:53:11.990 --> 00:53:16.190
I thought it wasn't a big deal because they lived through the story and your

907
00:53:16.191 --> 00:53:17.960
commentary was hilarious.

908
00:53:18.230 --> 00:53:22.340
I warn them about the explicit nature of your podcasts and that there were

909
00:53:22.341 --> 00:53:26.760
plenty of fucks throughout the fact that you did the granny water thing before

910
00:53:26.761 --> 00:53:30.480
it was even brought up,
uh,
was perfect.

911
00:53:30.930 --> 00:53:35.910
Everyone thought the story was hilarious.
That is until the p s

912
00:53:38.190 --> 00:53:42.840
uh,
if you recall,
I may or may have not called Hillary Clinton a cont.

913
00:53:44.250 --> 00:53:49.010
Uh,
Jesus,
that's right.
You did.
He goes,
yeah,
I know.
I'm a dumb ass bill.

914
00:53:49.010 --> 00:53:53.850
My fiance just turned to me and said,
did you write that?
Uh,

915
00:53:54.720 --> 00:53:56.940
he said,
my fiance turned to me and said,

916
00:53:56.941 --> 00:54:01.920
did you write that with that look on her face?
I knew I was fucked.

917
00:54:02.070 --> 00:54:06.330
So freckles.
I did the only thing I could,
I said,
oh,

918
00:54:06.331 --> 00:54:10.590
sorry about that.
I didn't write it.
Bill's email screener.
Guy Did.

919
00:54:11.550 --> 00:54:16.200
Andrew did,
he picks the emails each week,
then writes the little opening line,

920
00:54:16.890 --> 00:54:21.180
pun and then sometimes throws in a ps to make them more entertaining.

921
00:54:21.930 --> 00:54:24.720
When or why would you write this?
Cause if they listen to this,
you're fucked.

922
00:54:24.800 --> 00:54:27.600
And you know what,
Dude,
I have no sympathy for you.
Say,
here we go.
He goes,

923
00:54:27.601 --> 00:54:28.201
they bought it.

924
00:54:28.201 --> 00:54:31.650
So we just listened to the rest and we're laughing again by the end.

925
00:54:31.800 --> 00:54:34.350
So I through Andrew onto the bus on that one.

926
00:54:34.620 --> 00:54:38.970
I'm going to repeat my only good move from the last story and just shut the fuck

927
00:54:38.971 --> 00:54:42.060
up about it forever and the end all is well,

928
00:54:42.061 --> 00:54:45.720
thanks for reading it on the podcast.
It seemed to help smooth it over.

929
00:54:45.721 --> 00:54:49.020
No worries.
Just tell him not to listen to this one.
He goes,
by the way,

930
00:54:51.060 --> 00:54:55.320
um,
I just bought tickets to your show and I'm not gonna say where the show is in

931
00:54:55.321 --> 00:54:57.270
case anybody's figuring out who the fuck this is.

932
00:54:57.780 --> 00:55:02.780
It's the week after my wedding and my fiance slash wife by that point is coming

933
00:55:03.150 --> 00:55:07.540
too.
I'd love to meet you in person.
Thanks.
And Go fuck yourself.
Uh,

934
00:55:07.730 --> 00:55:08.860
all right,
well yeah,

935
00:55:09.810 --> 00:55:12.850
I'll be hanging out after Iowa.

936
00:55:13.890 --> 00:55:18.480
Just scream out.
Oh,
I just said where it was.
Oh,
well you're fucked.

937
00:55:19.560 --> 00:55:22.990
Grantee water screaming out and fucking say a to you.
All right.

938
00:55:22.991 --> 00:55:25.890
Now everybody's gonna do that.
They're all right,
girlfriend,

939
00:55:25.891 --> 00:55:29.610
leaving cleo.
Relax buddy.

940
00:55:30.630 --> 00:55:33.210
Go cold you noses.
It's usually not cold at night.

941
00:55:33.940 --> 00:55:36.780
You got a little gas left in the tank,
Huh?
You want to go?
Oh,
I know.
Okay.

942
00:55:36.840 --> 00:55:38.910
I got it.
I'm not going to say the whole sentence.
I will.

943
00:55:39.480 --> 00:55:44.040
I'm going to take you know who you know where when I'm done with this.
All right,

944
00:55:45.080 --> 00:55:47.970
Cleo,
go lay down buddy.
Could you please lay down?

945
00:55:47.971 --> 00:55:50.400
I don't have it in my heart to yell at you here.
All right,
cool.

946
00:55:50.460 --> 00:55:54.870
Could you lay down your fucking bastard?
I love you to get out of here.
Go on.

947
00:55:56.220 --> 00:56:00.540
Go on please.
Can you lay down please

948
00:56:02.100 --> 00:56:06.960
cleo?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Step on all my shit.
As you go over there,
just go lay down

949
00:56:09.780 --> 00:56:14.730
Jesus dog whisperer.
I am not.
Um,
oh,
by the way,

950
00:56:14.731 --> 00:56:18.240
how about those fucking concert wounded warriors?
How much money did I give them?

951
00:56:18.241 --> 00:56:21.570
If they're actual pieces of shit over there and they didn't give that fucking

952
00:56:21.571 --> 00:56:23.860
money to wounded troops,
you know,

953
00:56:24.430 --> 00:56:27.610
can I sue them to get the money back and then just give it to the fucking people

954
00:56:27.611 --> 00:56:28.720
they were allegedly going to help?

955
00:56:29.570 --> 00:56:30.403
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

956
00:56:30.840 --> 00:56:35.550
<v 0>I am really just,
I'm done.
I'm done with fucking charities.</v>

957
00:56:35.580 --> 00:56:39.090
I'm fucking done with them.
I just am eight.
Oh,

958
00:56:39.780 --> 00:56:41.190
I'm going Donald Trump on this one.

959
00:56:41.220 --> 00:56:44.100
I've seen two or three bad ones and now I'm judging all of them.
Fuck them.

960
00:56:45.540 --> 00:56:48.200
Saint Jude,
I'm sticking with them.
Okay.
If they ended up turning foot,

961
00:56:48.410 --> 00:56:51.070
they're bad then fuck all of them.
I'm just doing what I'm doing.

962
00:56:51.200 --> 00:56:54.840
Why did the other day drove up to somebody with one leg at a stoplight,

963
00:56:55.080 --> 00:56:57.880
observed that they weren't fucking wasted as much as I could tell in,

964
00:56:57.990 --> 00:56:59.520
here you go.
You know,
even if they were,

965
00:56:59.640 --> 00:57:03.090
I'd be drinking too if I had one leg right standing at a fucking stop sign.

966
00:57:05.010 --> 00:57:06.870
Um,
I don't know what the stop sign has to do with it.
What was it?

967
00:57:06.871 --> 00:57:10.250
A traffic light bill.
Well then,
you know,
maybe I have some yogurt,
um,

968
00:57:10.410 --> 00:57:13.230
girlfriend leaving for religious mission,

969
00:57:14.550 --> 00:57:17.160
a Billy Ball bag.

970
00:57:17.190 --> 00:57:21.390
My girlfriend and I are both college students and although we haven't been

971
00:57:21.391 --> 00:57:24.480
together for too long,
I could tell she is special in the way.

972
00:57:24.690 --> 00:57:28.920
When you meet the one,
you just know she's the person I have.

973
00:57:29.910 --> 00:57:33.570
She's the best person I've ever met.
Kind,
funny,
intelligent.

974
00:57:33.571 --> 00:57:38.100
And on top of that just drop dead gorgeous.
What?
Jesus lock that down to.

975
00:57:39.150 --> 00:57:41.310
Um,
if things seem to be too good to true,

976
00:57:41.910 --> 00:57:46.040
what if things seem too good to be true?
Jesus Christ,
I have,
sorry,

977
00:57:46.130 --> 00:57:50.120
I've got to have some form of fucking mild dyslexia or many even done,

978
00:57:50.300 --> 00:57:53.880
but then I thought I use a reform.
Uh,
uh,
things seem too good to be true.

979
00:57:53.881 --> 00:57:57.030
They are.
She's Mormon.
Oh

980
00:57:57.200 --> 00:57:59.050
<v 4>g</v>

981
00:57:59.390 --> 00:58:04.110
<v 0>and she's leaving for her mission in July.
If you don't know.
Um,</v>

982
00:58:04.400 --> 00:58:05.233
Mormons,

983
00:58:05.690 --> 00:58:09.020
I don't give a shit about Mormons and just anybody who's actively religious,

984
00:58:09.440 --> 00:58:10.740
you know,
to the point it,
it,

985
00:58:10.800 --> 00:58:14.660
it affects the decisions they make in life other than basic shit.
Like,
you know,

986
00:58:14.661 --> 00:58:17.120
don't throw a rocket that guy,
cause you wouldn't want them to do it to you.

987
00:58:17.150 --> 00:58:18.980
You know,
I,
I'm at one with that.
But when you know,

988
00:58:18.981 --> 00:58:22.940
when you start forming other opinions on you fucker religion,
I don't know.

989
00:58:23.100 --> 00:58:24.860
It starts to get a little,
a

990
00:58:26.690 --> 00:58:30.110
little a scion taller Christian,

991
00:58:31.310 --> 00:58:32.143
<v 4>Judy [inaudible],</v>

992
00:58:33.830 --> 00:58:35.830
<v 0>Buddha,
fucking Nizam,
whatever.
All of them.</v>

993
00:58:35.831 --> 00:58:38.020
Throw them all over and fucking Muslim.
Liam.

994
00:58:39.420 --> 00:58:42.610
It's a big fucking pot and stick it on a fucking pot,
right?
Yeah,
there you go.

995
00:58:42.850 --> 00:58:46.840
Show her the microwave from it.
Turn it on it.
Don't shut it off.
All right.

996
00:58:46.841 --> 00:58:50.200
She's a Mormon and she's leaving for her mission in July.
If you don't know,

997
00:58:50.201 --> 00:58:52.780
Mormons are a type of Christian.
I didn't know that,

998
00:58:53.080 --> 00:58:56.320
and they send missionaries around the world to convert people into their

999
00:58:56.321 --> 00:58:59.560
religion and she's getting sent to Zimbabwe.

1000
00:59:00.160 --> 00:59:03.100
Fucking Zimbabwe.
They leave for two years,

1001
00:59:03.460 --> 00:59:07.300
have to pay for everything themselves and aren't allowed to contact home the

1002
00:59:07.301 --> 00:59:08.350
entire time.

1003
00:59:10.300 --> 00:59:15.170
Why aren't they allowed to contact home the entire time?
That's fucking weird.

1004
00:59:15.530 --> 00:59:18.320
If she goes,
not only would that be the end of us,

1005
00:59:18.321 --> 00:59:23.120
but it's seriously hurts chances.
I've her future career aspiration,

1006
00:59:23.420 --> 00:59:26.420
we both wanted to become doctors.
I'm an atheist,

1007
00:59:26.421 --> 00:59:30.380
but I've recently found myself praying to Jesus that she doesn't actually go

1008
00:59:30.620 --> 00:59:33.470
because if and when she leaves,
that will be the end of it.

1009
00:59:33.800 --> 00:59:36.650
I don't know what to do.
Should I break things off now?

1010
00:59:36.670 --> 00:59:38.630
Should I try and convince her not to go?

1011
00:59:38.840 --> 00:59:42.920
Waiting is not an option for me because we'd be completely different people by

1012
00:59:42.921 --> 00:59:47.360
the time she gets back.
Thanks and go fuck yourself.
Um,

1013
00:59:49.400 --> 00:59:51.830
I dunno.
Do what?
I'm starting to think maybe she isn't the one for you.

1014
00:59:52.820 --> 00:59:56.630
If you're just going to,
you know,
if you have to debate telling her not,

1015
00:59:56.631 --> 01:00:00.140
should I just break it off or tell her not to go?
I mean,

1016
01:00:00.141 --> 01:00:02.930
I think if she really loved this woman,
you would you be going,

1017
01:00:02.931 --> 01:00:06.440
I'm just going to talk to her until I'm blue in the face

1018
01:00:07.970 --> 01:00:11.120
and tell her not to go.
And then even if she went,
you'd be thinking like,

1019
01:00:11.121 --> 01:00:14.720
well maybe you know,
you'd have a ray of light going,

1020
01:00:14.721 --> 01:00:16.400
well maybe to two years.

1021
01:00:16.401 --> 01:00:21.140
I Dunno if we agreed a fucking cool it for two years.

1022
01:00:22.250 --> 01:00:25.070
You know,
it's only two years.
When you look at the rest of your life,

1023
01:00:25.220 --> 01:00:28.230
you're Kinda like,
Eh,
we'd be two completely different people at jet.

1024
01:00:28.231 --> 01:00:32.270
Break it up now.
Yeah,
look,

1025
01:00:32.271 --> 01:00:34.190
she wants to go to Zimbabwe.
Let her,
you know,

1026
01:00:34.191 --> 01:00:38.600
to spread the fucking word of a whatever the fuck they're doing there.
Yeah.

1027
01:00:38.601 --> 01:00:42.270
Let her go.
Just,
you know,
if

1028
01:00:43.790 --> 01:00:45.910
somebody wants to go somewhere to go do something,

1029
01:00:45.920 --> 01:00:49.880
what are you gonna tell him not to go?
Go ahead.
Yeah,

1030
01:00:50.960 --> 01:00:55.130
go ahead.
Go,
go.
Spread the fucking dumb shit they put in your head and go,
go,

1031
01:00:55.131 --> 01:00:58.100
go spread it on the other side of the world's poor fucking Zimbabwe.

1032
01:00:59.510 --> 01:01:02.600
Peep Zimbabwean people.
Now you went fucking Zimbabwe.

1033
01:01:02.770 --> 01:01:05.600
You know I was assuming you meant because it's so far away you couldn't visit

1034
01:01:05.601 --> 01:01:09.830
her.
Let's see what's going on in Zimbabwe right now.
Zim.

1035
01:01:09.831 --> 01:01:14.480
Bob,
way as exactly how it should be spelled.
Z I m B A,
B,

1036
01:01:15.040 --> 01:01:15.180
Wwii.

1037
01:01:15.180 --> 01:01:18.560
I'd be such a great fucking speller if everything was spelled like Zimbabwe,

1038
01:01:20.160 --> 01:01:25.130
Zimbabwe,
Z ,
I m B,
a,
B,
Wwii,
Zimbabwe,

1039
01:01:26.730 --> 01:01:27.563
Zambia,

1040
01:01:27.830 --> 01:01:32.710
<v 1>Bob.
We soon we'll be converting you to more men.</v>

1041
01:01:33.970 --> 01:01:37.900
<v 0>Do,
do,
do you got to go two years of your life to fucking for what?</v>

1042
01:01:39.840 --> 01:01:40.800
Alright.
Zimbabwe.

1043
01:01:41.890 --> 01:01:46.090
Zimbabwe is a beautiful country in southern Africa that is known for its

1044
01:01:46.091 --> 01:01:49.330
dramatic a way,
way,
way would come on.
Oh,
this is the government.

1045
01:01:49.510 --> 01:01:52.120
This is the government websites.
So this is all the propaganda here.
Oh,

1046
01:01:52.330 --> 01:01:53.230
it's absolutely beautiful.

1047
01:01:53.231 --> 01:01:55.840
You can have your wallet and fucking tape to your chest.
No one will take it.

1048
01:01:56.660 --> 01:01:59.150
<v 1>Everybody's wonderful down here.
Everybody's welcome.</v>

1049
01:01:59.151 --> 01:02:02.540
Please come down and spend all your fucking money.
You know,
if you don't mind.

1050
01:02:03.600 --> 01:02:03.630
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1051
01:02:03.630 --> 01:02:08.630
<v 1>Zimbabwe was voted the number one place in Zimbabwe to go three years in a row.</v>

1052
01:02:09.050 --> 01:02:12.920
<v 0>Wow.
Jesus,
look at that.
Fuck.
That puts an Agora falls to shame.</v>

1053
01:02:12.980 --> 01:02:14.060
Holy Shit.

1054
01:02:15.220 --> 01:02:18.530
So Bob was a beautiful country in southern Africa that is known for its dramatic

1055
01:02:18.531 --> 01:02:22.770
landscapes.
It's diverse.
Wildlife,
see Cobras and tigers,

1056
01:02:23.190 --> 01:02:28.060
and it's hardworking people home to the Great Zimbabwe Monument,

1057
01:02:28.090 --> 01:02:32.710
the mighty Victorian falls and the majestic eastern highlands.

1058
01:02:32.711 --> 01:02:37.330
The country also boasts of worldclass national parks in which a variety of

1059
01:02:37.331 --> 01:02:41.250
animals,
including the big five can be found.
The big fat.

1060
01:02:41.650 --> 01:02:45.850
What the fuck are the big five?
Big Five.

1061
01:02:45.851 --> 01:02:50.380
I've got to go lion.
Who's your big five?
It's like the Chris rock movie.
Top Five.

1062
01:02:50.560 --> 01:02:54.880
Gimme a big five.
I'd say the Big Five.
You've got to go lion.

1063
01:02:55.300 --> 01:02:58.270
Tiger,
elephant doubt.
Doubt.
Right?

1064
01:02:59.780 --> 01:03:04.670
That's like Montana.
Brady can Johnny Unitas the third one?
You never know,

1065
01:03:04.671 --> 01:03:07.460
right?
Whatever they're there were in everybody's top five.

1066
01:03:07.550 --> 01:03:10.790
If you know anything about football,
right?
Alright.
Lion.
Tiger,
elephant,

1067
01:03:13.910 --> 01:03:16.580
hippos.
Rhinos.
Giraffes are big

1068
01:03:18.320 --> 01:03:22.910
gorillas.
Some big motherfuckers.
Hang on a second.
I've got to look up big five.

1069
01:03:22.911 --> 01:03:24.260
They see this.
This is,
how are you doing?
What?
You know,

1070
01:03:24.261 --> 01:03:28.580
I'm going to get the sports club big five sporting goods.
Big Five

1071
01:03:30.940 --> 01:03:34.720
animals in Africa.

1072
01:03:36.810 --> 01:03:41.350
All right.
In Africa,
the big five game animals are

1073
01:03:43.050 --> 01:03:44.340
the African lion.

1074
01:03:47.090 --> 01:03:47.430
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1075
01:03:47.430 --> 01:03:50.760
<v 0>The African elephant plan.
Like I says,
African,</v>

1076
01:03:50.880 --> 01:03:53.370
you know like what it's supposed to,
what the Rhode Island one,

1077
01:03:54.010 --> 01:03:57.860
the one at that fucking zoo.
The Cape Buffalo.
Oh,

1078
01:03:58.500 --> 01:04:00.810
the African Leopard.
Ah,

1079
01:04:01.620 --> 01:04:04.860
and the white slash black rhinoceros.
All right,

1080
01:04:04.861 --> 01:04:07.690
so I've got three out of eight and said hippo.
Rhino.
Well,

1081
01:04:07.710 --> 01:04:10.020
when a fucks the Hippel big five game.

1082
01:04:13.040 --> 01:04:16.280
All right.
In Africa,
the big five game animals are American.
Okay.
The Lion,

1083
01:04:16.281 --> 01:04:19.610
the elephant,
the Buffalo,
the leopard,
and the rhinoceros.
Oh,

1084
01:04:19.611 --> 01:04:23.000
is this the thing that dentists paid to fly over and go fucking shoot these

1085
01:04:23.001 --> 01:04:26.800
things?
All right.
All right,
so there you go.

1086
01:04:26.801 --> 01:04:29.050
So we learned a little something here.
That's the big five.

1087
01:04:29.950 --> 01:04:34.270
The largest of these are the national park in the west and the something else

1088
01:04:34.271 --> 01:04:38.350
transfrontier park in the south has a total area of three or nines as an edge

1089
01:04:38.530 --> 01:04:41.020
then.
All right,
let's get to the,
let's get to the real questions.

1090
01:04:43.660 --> 01:04:47.630
Um,
Americans
welcomes

1091
01:04:49.360 --> 01:04:52.270
in Zimbabwe.

1092
01:04:53.550 --> 01:04:53.890
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1093
01:04:53.890 --> 01:04:55.600
<v 0>Did we do anything that out did,</v>

1094
01:04:55.660 --> 01:04:59.110
did the upper 1% in this country piss them off?

1095
01:05:01.820 --> 01:05:06.700
All right.
Americans in Zimbabwe
that,

1096
01:05:06.701 --> 01:05:11.380
that at the de and I should say,
are you looking for fellow Americans in zip up?

1097
01:05:11.740 --> 01:05:13.450
No,
I'm not looking for a fucking pen pal.

1098
01:05:14.710 --> 01:05:17.830
Six things I had wrong because last thing I read about Zimbabwe here,
all right.

1099
01:05:17.890 --> 01:05:21.640
Six things I had wrong about traveling to Zimbabwe.
Look at those elephants.

1100
01:05:21.860 --> 01:05:24.880
Fuck it.
Love those things.
I cannot believe people kill those things.

1101
01:05:25.750 --> 01:05:28.060
How could you kill an elephant?
I couldn't kill any of those fucking things.

1102
01:05:30.350 --> 01:05:31.183
<v 3>MMM.</v>

1103
01:05:31.300 --> 01:05:32.750
<v 0>All right.
The top five things.</v>

1104
01:05:33.020 --> 01:05:36.410
Six things I had wrong about traveling to Zimbabwe and one I had right?

1105
01:05:36.470 --> 01:05:39.800
Number one,
Zimbabwe's dangerous.
Uh,

1106
01:05:39.801 --> 01:05:44.801
at Matador we believe most travel advisories in American perceptions of overseas

1107
01:05:45.460 --> 01:05:48.630
destination being dangerous are way overblown.
I enjoy visiting,
say Dah,
Dah,
Dah,

1108
01:05:48.640 --> 01:05:50.150
Dah.
The big cities.

1109
01:05:51.840 --> 01:05:52.673
<v 3>MMM.</v>

1110
01:05:53.960 --> 01:05:55.120
<v 0>The big cities are the most,</v>

1111
01:05:55.330 --> 01:05:58.340
or where the most violent crime is concentrated like in the United States.

1112
01:05:58.341 --> 01:06:03.341
It wasn't a surprise that then that Victoria Falls as well as the couple

1113
01:06:04.371 --> 01:06:07.670
national parks we visited felt to just about as safe and as friendly as any

1114
01:06:07.671 --> 01:06:12.140
place can get.
In fact,
Victoria Falls has such a small town feel that,
uh,

1115
01:06:12.380 --> 01:06:13.640
other journalists joked,

1116
01:06:13.910 --> 01:06:18.080
it had the vibe of US national park in the off season.
All right,
cool.

1117
01:06:18.530 --> 01:06:23.000
Zimbabwe's wildlife has all been wiped out.
This was a big one for me.

1118
01:06:23.001 --> 01:06:26.240
I love seeing wildlife.
This is making me want to go there.

1119
01:06:26.241 --> 01:06:30.380
Three hyperinflation will make buying things a total hassle.

1120
01:06:31.580 --> 01:06:34.810
You have to sing years of new coverage,
hyperinflation,
and I was fixing him,
blah,

1121
01:06:34.811 --> 01:06:35.644
blah,
blah,
blah.

1122
01:06:35.840 --> 01:06:40.310
I'd have to carry around bricks of $10 $10 billion notes to buy a bunch of bear.

1123
01:06:40.840 --> 01:06:43.270
Let the currency of Zimbabwe has become so worthless.

1124
01:06:43.520 --> 01:06:44.930
They've retired it completely.

1125
01:06:45.340 --> 01:06:47.990
And the country now operates on a misks of foreign currency,

1126
01:06:47.991 --> 01:06:52.370
including the South Africa.
K beyond the wildlife.
There's not much to do or see.

1127
01:06:52.371 --> 01:06:56.840
There's rafting,
bungee jumping,
microlight flying over.
Victory,

1128
01:06:56.841 --> 01:07:01.740
fall fishing,
swimming.
All right,

1129
01:07:01.741 --> 01:07:04.680
well what the fuck did you get?
Right?
I'm not reading all this shit.

1130
01:07:05.640 --> 01:07:10.140
Look at this fucking videos.
Swimming and Victoria Falls.
Get the fuck Outta here.

1131
01:07:11.650 --> 01:07:14.110
This is this thing that looks like it's bigger than Niagara Falls.

1132
01:07:14.140 --> 01:07:15.940
No fucking way.

1133
01:07:20.650 --> 01:07:20.870
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

1134
01:07:20.870 --> 01:07:24.590
<v 0>So basically the water isn't flowing fast enough to these fucking got,
okay,</v>

1135
01:07:24.700 --> 01:07:26.360
I've got to put a,
send a link to this video.

1136
01:07:29.480 --> 01:07:30.313
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

1137
01:07:30.950 --> 01:07:34.640
<v 0>Who is the absolute fucking psycho that figured out you could do that?</v>

1138
01:07:36.200 --> 01:07:39.920
Dude,
if you just saw the pasty fat fucking white dude who just jumped in there.

1139
01:07:40.910 --> 01:07:45.050
You know what's funny?
He's there with two fucking two black guys,
man.

1140
01:07:45.080 --> 01:07:48.740
It'd be funny if they grabbed him and threw him over.
That was for slavery.

1141
01:07:53.050 --> 01:07:57.860
All right,
let me,
uh,
all right.
I got a copy of that.
Jesus Christ.

1142
01:07:57.861 --> 01:08:01.460
What a fucking loan.
There's no,
no way.
There's no fucking way.
No fucking way.

1143
01:08:01.490 --> 01:08:05.170
All right,
let's get back to the,
uh,
the things here.
All right.
Um,

1144
01:08:07.840 --> 01:08:12.740
where am I?
All right.
Tinder.
Oh,
Billy.
Let's read some emails for the week.
Uh,

1145
01:08:12.741 --> 01:08:16.670
I hooked up with this girl.
I met on Tinder the first in years.

1146
01:08:16.850 --> 01:08:19.730
I'm not a bad looking guy.
I'm not a bad looking guy.

1147
01:08:19.731 --> 01:08:24.110
I think I just suck at small talk over or over text.
Any who?

1148
01:08:24.111 --> 01:08:25.160
This girl is 21.

1149
01:08:25.161 --> 01:08:29.090
I didn't expect it to go anywhere after we matched up and we ended up hooking
up.

1150
01:08:29.270 --> 01:08:29.991
She's really cool.

1151
01:08:29.991 --> 01:08:34.730
We've hung out a few times since my friend and his girlfriend started saying

1152
01:08:34.760 --> 01:08:39.020
that was gross.
Uh,
I am 30 years old now.

1153
01:08:39.021 --> 01:08:42.620
I know my friend is being lame because his girlfriend was there,

1154
01:08:42.710 --> 01:08:46.220
but gross not at all,
so I let them have their ignorant opinions.

1155
01:08:46.221 --> 01:08:47.660
Then I dropped the facts on them.

1156
01:08:48.110 --> 01:08:51.290
She looks more like she's 24th do this really isn't helping you.

1157
01:08:51.470 --> 01:08:54.140
I look like I'm 25 that's also not helping you.

1158
01:08:54.320 --> 01:08:58.460
She took extra classes to graduate college early and is already accepted into

1159
01:08:58.461 --> 01:09:02.870
medical schools.
Still not helping you.
She speaks four languages fluently.
Oh,

1160
01:09:02.871 --> 01:09:05.240
I see what you're saying.
She's not a dumb fuck.
She knows what she's doing.

1161
01:09:05.241 --> 01:09:06.430
I don't mean hello and goodbye.

1162
01:09:06.530 --> 01:09:09.290
She can carry on full on comp conversations in Mandarin,

1163
01:09:09.291 --> 01:09:11.210
French and Italian as well as English.
Of course.

1164
01:09:11.600 --> 01:09:16.520
She has much better table manners then both of them.
Oh,
you said that.
Wow.

1165
01:09:16.580 --> 01:09:17.840
If you just torched the whole friendship.

1166
01:09:18.020 --> 01:09:19.920
I pointed this out to my friend's girlfriend.

1167
01:09:19.990 --> 01:09:24.320
He didn't have a Napkin on her lap and our elbows were on the table and pointed

1168
01:09:25.860 --> 01:09:28.200
that very fact out to her as well.
Also,

1169
01:09:28.201 --> 01:09:31.490
I mentioned that when me and this girl met for a drink,

1170
01:09:32.100 --> 01:09:36.180
she put her napkin on your lap before she bought her drink to her mouth.

1171
01:09:37.370 --> 01:09:41.280
Uh,
which would have hovered over her lap awareness levels maximum.

1172
01:09:42.280 --> 01:09:43.040
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1173
01:09:43.040 --> 01:09:47.270
<v 0>Uh,
21.
Who gives a fuck?
I like to think I'm right and then I made a good point,</v>

1174
01:09:47.271 --> 01:09:51.980
but I need the opinion of your honor.
Billy Burke.
Uh,
yes.
Fuck.
Damn.
You're 30.

1175
01:09:51.981 --> 01:09:55.100
She's 21.
Who gives a shit good for you.
You're fucking crushing it.

1176
01:09:55.280 --> 01:09:58.990
She's a fucking adult and uh,
she's not a dope.

1177
01:09:59.090 --> 01:10:02.210
You didn't roof here and there too.
Miserable fucks in our relationship.

1178
01:10:02.980 --> 01:10:07.010
All right.
We've got food coming out of the side of their mouth.
Carry on.

1179
01:10:07.840 --> 01:10:11.900
All right.
My kid wants to play football.
Hey,
Billy Bellacheck,

1180
01:10:12.740 --> 01:10:17.680
Bella,
Bella Lik,
um,
I'm a huge football fan.

1181
01:10:17.681 --> 01:10:20.560
Watch every week,
Yada,
Yada,
Yada.
My kid is seven and loves it too.

1182
01:10:20.710 --> 01:10:23.200
He plays baseball and basketball and it's really fast.

1183
01:10:23.201 --> 01:10:27.550
We played catch with a football in the year and he's really fast,

1184
01:10:27.551 --> 01:10:29.860
which has given him the desire to be a wide receiver.

1185
01:10:30.010 --> 01:10:32.500
Granted it's not the worst pound and you can get on the field.

1186
01:10:32.710 --> 01:10:35.830
I don't want to play football.
Uh,
he's a great athlete,

1187
01:10:35.831 --> 01:10:40.030
but I'm not one of those delusional dads who thinks he's going pro in whatever

1188
01:10:40.031 --> 01:10:44.440
he does.
He's not small,
but definitely not the biggest of his age group.

1189
01:10:44.770 --> 01:10:48.790
How do I not sound like a cranky old man or worried old mother and explained to

1190
01:10:48.791 --> 01:10:50.080
him how it's not worth it?

1191
01:10:50.320 --> 01:10:53.920
Should I just show him footage from a 30 for 30 to scare the shit out of them?

1192
01:10:55.420 --> 01:10:57.910
Oh Man.
Dude,
that is such a,
um,

1193
01:11:00.400 --> 01:11:04.060
contemporary question,
relevant question,
whatever,
you know.
Um,

1194
01:11:05.640 --> 01:11:06.080
<v 3>yeah,</v>

1195
01:11:06.080 --> 01:11:09.650
<v 0>I would actually defer this to the Internet.
I believe it or not.</v>

1196
01:11:09.651 --> 01:11:13.830
And then you have to use your own judgment as to whether you're listening to

1197
01:11:13.831 --> 01:11:17.250
somebody who is informed and,
or somebody who isn't.
Can you,

1198
01:11:17.280 --> 01:11:19.560
can you do like a middle ground and maybe hockey?

1199
01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:22.870
Maybe you can get them into hockey.
I guess you,

1200
01:11:22.940 --> 01:11:26.090
you'd have to like hockey if you don't like hockey.
Um,

1201
01:11:26.310 --> 01:11:30.630
cause it would have the physical aspects of it.
But,
um,
those guys don't just go,

1202
01:11:30.660 --> 01:11:35.220
don't fucking slam into each other every play.
Um,

1203
01:11:36.390 --> 01:11:38.640
you know what,
dude,
I don't know how to bring that up.

1204
01:11:38.730 --> 01:11:40.890
I would just be honest with them and just say,
listen,

1205
01:11:41.910 --> 01:11:43.830
I don't want to seem like a cranky old man.

1206
01:11:43.831 --> 01:11:46.740
I don't want to seem like a worried mother like you just said.
But um,

1207
01:11:47.460 --> 01:11:50.430
I'm really worried about the longterm effects

1208
01:11:52.170 --> 01:11:53.460
of you playing football.

1209
01:11:53.520 --> 01:11:58.490
And I would even say longterm effects talk to them like an adult.
Just say,
yeah,

1210
01:11:58.550 --> 01:12:02.690
I am worried that you know,
you,
if you get hit the wrong way,

1211
01:12:02.691 --> 01:12:05.810
God forbid people get paralyzed,
people die.

1212
01:12:05.840 --> 01:12:09.590
People have fucking don't say fucking people who have brain injuries.

1213
01:12:09.591 --> 01:12:12.680
I would go down that road and just,
I would just say to the kid,

1214
01:12:13.990 --> 01:12:14.460
<v 2>yeah,</v>

1215
01:12:14.460 --> 01:12:18.630
<v 0>your concerns.
And if he really wants to fucking play,</v>

1216
01:12:19.950 --> 01:12:24.600
then you know,
you just do what Peyton did.

1217
01:12:24.601 --> 01:12:26.580
You just get some roids sent house.

1218
01:12:26.610 --> 01:12:29.190
You put them in your wife's name and you get this kid,
you,

1219
01:12:29.310 --> 01:12:34.050
you let them do a cycle right before the season starts and you let him kick the

1220
01:12:34.051 --> 01:12:37.590
fuck out of somebody else's kid,
not yours.
Right?
There you go.
Okay.

1221
01:12:39.360 --> 01:12:41.380
I'm just fucking around.
Obviously.
The first thing I said I would,

1222
01:12:41.381 --> 01:12:45.240
I would seek more information on that and figure out how you do it in the best

1223
01:12:45.241 --> 01:12:49.710
way.
All right.
Pete and my house man,
terrorist bill,

1224
01:12:49.980 --> 01:12:52.800
my house needs painting.
It has about six years.

1225
01:12:52.830 --> 01:12:56.760
It's been about six years since it's been painted.
We moved in four years ago.

1226
01:12:56.761 --> 01:12:58.020
I've painted a house before by,

1227
01:12:58.021 --> 01:13:01.110
my wife thinks I'm going to fuck it up and or it will take too long.

1228
01:13:01.410 --> 01:13:05.340
You know what?
I'm with her already.
Uh,
I've been telling her that I,

1229
01:13:05.341 --> 01:13:10.320
I'll say it'll save thousands of dollars.
She says that's not the point.

1230
01:13:10.620 --> 01:13:13.740
She's right.
It's not entirely the point.
I make good money.

1231
01:13:13.770 --> 01:13:15.570
I just want to paint the house.

1232
01:13:15.840 --> 01:13:19.740
It's my first house and I feel the need to do something to leave my mark on it,

1233
01:13:20.070 --> 01:13:24.140
literally and figuratively speaking.
Um,
I'll take,

1234
01:13:24.190 --> 01:13:28.290
it'll take me about three weeks to do the whole house.
Not working every day,

1235
01:13:28.410 --> 01:13:29.790
but three,
four days a week.

1236
01:13:29.820 --> 01:13:32.010
I have a neighbor who's going to be home from college,

1237
01:13:32.011 --> 01:13:36.360
who I've introduced to music and he's never heard.
Oh,

1238
01:13:36.361 --> 01:13:37.770
listen to him to music he's never heard.

1239
01:13:37.771 --> 01:13:41.520
So it's a great excuse to give the kid a few bucks while introducing him to

1240
01:13:41.521 --> 01:13:45.780
early Soundgarden and Jane's Addiction.
Uh,
she started bringing things up like,

1241
01:13:45.781 --> 01:13:49.380
well,
what if it starts raining?
She's got nothing left on this one.

1242
01:13:49.410 --> 01:13:53.670
I have to paint my house.
It's not a manly thing.
It's not to prove a point.

1243
01:13:53.700 --> 01:13:58.380
It's taking pride and ownership thoughts on this.
I say,
you listen to your wife.

1244
01:13:59.940 --> 01:14:01.860
Do you want to do some fucking,

1245
01:14:01.861 --> 01:14:05.850
you finish your garage to something like that.
Okay.

1246
01:14:06.030 --> 01:14:09.810
Do something in there where it's a part of a room that she doesn't have to

1247
01:14:09.811 --> 01:14:10.644
fucking deal with.

1248
01:14:10.800 --> 01:14:13.870
Just have some pros come over there and have them knock it out and have them

1249
01:14:14.230 --> 01:14:17.740
charge you through the fucking nose and you sit inside drinking a fucking beer.

1250
01:14:18.180 --> 01:14:20.950
All right?
This other shit that you can do on the house.

1251
01:14:22.410 --> 01:14:24.180
<v 4>Um,
you know,</v>

1252
01:14:25.130 --> 01:14:29.840
<v 0>I just painting a fucking houses.
That's a big one,
dude.
That is a big one.</v>

1253
01:14:29.841 --> 01:14:31.220
I understand that you want to do it.

1254
01:14:32.520 --> 01:14:33.353
<v 4>MMM.</v>

1255
01:14:33.700 --> 01:14:36.190
<v 0>But yeah,
I,
I'm with you wife on this one too.
You know,</v>

1256
01:14:36.280 --> 01:14:41.080
you already got a fucking job.
Okay.
You make a good money.
Pay Somebody to do it.

1257
01:14:41.200 --> 01:14:41.970
All right?

1258
01:14:41.970 --> 01:14:44.620
There's a bunch of shit on my house that I started to do and I just started

1259
01:14:44.621 --> 01:14:46.390
thinking,
you know what?
I'm making a good living.
Fuck this.

1260
01:14:46.391 --> 01:14:48.370
Why don't I have a pro come over.
I can do it.

1261
01:14:48.460 --> 01:14:50.770
I can figure I was patching up holes in walls.

1262
01:14:50.980 --> 01:14:54.100
I was learning how to do that shit.
You know,

1263
01:14:54.130 --> 01:14:58.710
I was fucking fixing the j trap under my sink and doing all of that fucking
crap.

1264
01:14:58.860 --> 01:15:00.550
Didn't learn all of that shit.
My last department.

1265
01:15:00.551 --> 01:15:01.870
Then I got to the house and it's like,
all right,

1266
01:15:02.020 --> 01:15:06.340
well I can do this or I can have a pro come over here and do it and do it

1267
01:15:06.341 --> 01:15:09.130
fucking right.
Okay.
Now I'm speaking for myself here.

1268
01:15:09.610 --> 01:15:14.610
My house was fucking wall toward wall floor to ceiling inside and out.

1269
01:15:14.980 --> 01:15:18.940
Do it yourself fucking hacks.
All right.
And

1270
01:15:20.540 --> 01:15:22.670
I wasn't going to carry that fucking baton anymore.

1271
01:15:22.671 --> 01:15:25.640
Everything that I have had done on my house has been done by fucking

1272
01:15:25.641 --> 01:15:28.970
professionals and my house is as much as I bitch about it.

1273
01:15:30.300 --> 01:15:31.133
<v 4>MMM.</v>

1274
01:15:31.210 --> 01:15:35.140
<v 0>It's 70% this shit at this point.
It really is no ticket.
This garage done.</v>

1275
01:15:35.141 --> 01:15:36.940
And then I got,
you know,
my kitchen's fucked up.

1276
01:15:38.090 --> 01:15:41.470
Don't you get me started with all the exterior doors and windows.
Okay.

1277
01:15:41.530 --> 01:15:43.990
In the wood rot and some of the other shit I have to deal with.

1278
01:15:43.991 --> 01:15:48.960
But generally speaking like this fucking place is solid and um,
I dunno dude.

1279
01:15:48.961 --> 01:15:52.170
Fuck that to you.
You won't go a fucking ladder.
You know what I mean?

1280
01:15:52.171 --> 01:15:56.220
Mixing the Goddamn paint,
doing all of that bullshit.
Um,

1281
01:15:56.310 --> 01:15:57.660
I would just,
I would,

1282
01:15:58.160 --> 01:15:58.993
<v 4>yeah,</v>

1283
01:16:00.250 --> 01:16:04.700
<v 0>just,
just pay for it.
Just pay for it and just say,
this bill is what you do.</v>

1284
01:16:04.850 --> 01:16:08.360
Don't just do it.
Just don't do what your wife says.
Get something out of it.

1285
01:16:08.450 --> 01:16:11.060
All right.
Be like,
alright.
You know what,
I thought about it.

1286
01:16:11.840 --> 01:16:12.980
I don't agree with it,

1287
01:16:13.520 --> 01:16:16.940
but I know that you would feel better if somebody else did it.
Okay?

1288
01:16:16.941 --> 01:16:21.941
So I am going to hire a professional company to paint the house and she's like,

1289
01:16:23.481 --> 01:16:26.030
okay good.
And I'll be like,
I'm not finished.
I'm not finished.

1290
01:16:26.850 --> 01:16:27.683
<v 4>However,</v>

1291
01:16:28.870 --> 01:16:30.370
<v 0>because I am doing that,</v>

1292
01:16:30.710 --> 01:16:35.710
I am going to Redo the garage and the garage is going to be a place where me and

1293
01:16:36.881 --> 01:16:40.090
my friends,
we play poker and we smoked cigars once a week.

1294
01:16:40.240 --> 01:16:41.740
I'm gonna have my own fridge in there.

1295
01:16:41.890 --> 01:16:44.980
There's going to be a lock on the door that you do not have a key for.

1296
01:16:45.070 --> 01:16:48.850
When you see,
um,
exotic women walking in and out of that,

1297
01:16:48.910 --> 01:16:51.670
you are not to ask questions.
Is this understood?
Right?

1298
01:16:51.671 --> 01:16:54.640
You just say crazy shit like that right over the fucking top.

1299
01:16:54.970 --> 01:16:57.910
And then she's done laughing.
Then you say,
what the fuck you really want?

1300
01:16:57.911 --> 01:17:02.080
It will pale in comparison to fucking exotic women walking in and out of your

1301
01:17:02.081 --> 01:17:05.740
garage and you'll be fucking in.
So I would think about what else you want.

1302
01:17:06.480 --> 01:17:08.260
All right?
And at the end of the fucking day,

1303
01:17:08.261 --> 01:17:10.700
you're going to get something that you want somebody else who's going to pay you

1304
01:17:10.990 --> 01:17:14.210
out.
Paint,
uh,
paint your house.
I think you're gonna win.
Personally speaking.

1305
01:17:14.211 --> 01:17:15.590
That's what I think.
All right.
And you know what,

1306
01:17:15.591 --> 01:17:18.980
that's the podcast for this week,
mother fuckers.
Um,

1307
01:17:19.220 --> 01:17:22.580
thank you for listening as always and I'm really excited about all these dates

1308
01:17:22.581 --> 01:17:26.390
that I have coming up and,
uh,
I,

1309
01:17:26.500 --> 01:17:29.810
I cannot fucking wait to go to Iowa.
I'm so excited about the Saint Louis.

1310
01:17:30.020 --> 01:17:33.590
Some of the great fucking sports fans I've ever met in my life or in Saint Louis

1311
01:17:33.591 --> 01:17:38.120
and God knows they got enough Budweiser's.
Long Beach is fucking,

1312
01:17:38.810 --> 01:17:41.660
uh,
the Goddamn motherfucking,
uh,
Richard Pryor Gig,

1313
01:17:41.870 --> 01:17:45.650
Riverside,
Riverside,
California.
I fucking,
you know,

1314
01:17:45.651 --> 01:17:48.670
when I was learning how to fly,
I had to,
I had the land there and I did the,

1315
01:17:48.671 --> 01:17:52.430
the fucking French valley flight had a flight or Riverside,

1316
01:17:52.520 --> 01:17:57.110
then out the French valley and back to Long Beach.
Um,
shit,

1317
01:17:57.111 --> 01:18:00.080
I might fly over there.
That would be awesome.
Um,
ames,

1318
01:18:00.081 --> 01:18:02.810
Iowa obviously cannot wait to go to there or Lando.

1319
01:18:02.811 --> 01:18:04.850
I haven't been there in a minute.
Jacksonville,
Florida.

1320
01:18:04.851 --> 01:18:08.390
Last time I was there and went to a gun gun range and shut fucking guns with

1321
01:18:08.391 --> 01:18:10.520
silencers.
You think I'm not gonna do that again?

1322
01:18:10.880 --> 01:18:15.640
Portland may my old stomping grounds.
Albany,
New York,
um,

1323
01:18:15.860 --> 01:18:18.320
Newark,
New Jersey.
These are all places I love all those places.

1324
01:18:18.321 --> 01:18:21.200
I can't wait to get out there.
I've been working my ass off of my act.

1325
01:18:21.230 --> 01:18:23.840
If he come out,
I'm gonna make you laugh your fucking ass off.
Okay.

1326
01:18:24.620 --> 01:18:27.050
So if you can make it,
I would really appreciate it.
All right.

1327
01:18:27.051 --> 01:18:29.690
And I'm actually trying to think of a tour name if you can come up with a name

1328
01:18:29.691 --> 01:18:33.140
for it,
you know,
cause these dates.
I'm in Canada,
I'm in North America.

1329
01:18:33.380 --> 01:18:35.420
I'm in fucking,
you know,
well Canada's North America.

1330
01:18:35.420 --> 01:18:38.330
I'm in the United States of America,
right?
I'm on the East Coast,

1331
01:18:38.331 --> 01:18:41.990
I'm in the Midwest,
I'm in the south.
I can't think of a name for the tour.

1332
01:18:42.290 --> 01:18:44.060
I don't know why I have to name the tour,

1333
01:18:44.061 --> 01:18:46.160
but my agent says I got to come up with a name for it.

1334
01:18:46.310 --> 01:18:48.740
So I'm thinking the checking in on your tour.
I don't know why.

1335
01:18:48.770 --> 01:18:53.490
If you guys got any ideas,
just tweet them to me,
uh,
at Bill Burr,

1336
01:18:53.600 --> 01:18:55.570
whatever the,
I don't even know what my Twitter is,
you know,

1337
01:18:55.670 --> 01:18:58.640
I don't even know what it is.
So whatever.
If you've got time to look it up,

1338
01:18:58.890 --> 01:19:01.370
send it to me.
If you don't,
I understand.
All right.
Go fuck yourselves.

1339
01:19:01.450 --> 01:19:02.210
We'll talk to you on Thursday.
