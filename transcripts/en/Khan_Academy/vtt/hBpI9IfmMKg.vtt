00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:02.850
- [Instructor] Tara was
hiking up a mountain.

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.180
She started her hike at an
elevation of 1,200 meters

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.370
and ascended at a constant rate.

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.370
After four hours, she reached
an elevation of 1,700 meters.

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:18.340
Let y represent Tara's elevation
in meters after x hours.

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:19.990
And they ask us, and this is from

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:21.490
an exercise on Khan Academy, it says,

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:23.660
complete the equation for the relationship

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:25.690
between the elevation
and the number of hours.

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:27.850
And if you're on Khan
Academy, you would type it in,

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:29.200
but we can do it by hand.

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.190
So pause this video and
work it out on some paper

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:34.750
and let's see if we get to the same place.

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:37.050
All right, now let's do this together.

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.260
So first of all, they tell us

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.220
that she's ascending at a constant rate.

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:42.927
So that's a pretty good indication

00:00:42.927 --> 00:00:46.040
that we could describe her elevation

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.510
based on the number of hours she travels

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.150
with a linear equation.

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:52.770
And we could even figure
out that constant rate.

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.420
It says that she goes from 1,200 meters

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:58.710
to 1,700 meters in four hours.

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.420
So we could say her rate

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.680
is going to be her change in elevation

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:04.880
over a change in time.

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:08.450
So her change in elevation is 1,700 meters

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:13.450
minus 1,200 meters and she
does this over four hours.

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:17.580
Over, her change in time is four hours.

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.713
So her constant rate
in the numerator here,

00:01:19.713 --> 00:01:23.660
1,700 minus 1,200 is 500 meters.

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:26.423
She's able to go up 500
meters in four hours.

00:01:28.758 --> 00:01:30.010
If we divide 500 by four,

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:35.010
this is 125 meters per hour.

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.170
And so we could use this now

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:41.360
to think about what our equation would be.

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.220
Our elevation y would be equal to,

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.720
well, where is she starting?

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.890
Well, it's starting at 1,200 meters.

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:50.270
So she's starting at 1,200 meters.

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.050
And then to that, we're going to add

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:58.360
how much she climbs based on
how many hours she's traveled.

00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:59.920
So it's going to be this rate,

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.030
125 meters per hour times

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.100
the number of hours she has been hiking.

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.460
So the number of hours is x times x.

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:11.420
So this right over here is an equation

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:12.957
for the relationship between the elevation

00:02:12.957 --> 00:02:14.560
and the number of hours.

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.110
Another way you could
have thought about it,

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.943
you could have said, okay,

00:02:16.943 --> 00:02:18.980
this is going to be a linear equation

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.060
because she's ascending
at a constant rate.

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.010
You could say the slope intercept form

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:28.010
for a linear equation is
y is equal to mx plus b,

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.400
where b is your y-intercept.

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.710
What is the value of y
when x is equal to zero?

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:33.560
And you'd say, all right,

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:34.470
when x is equal to zero,

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.173
she's at an elevation of 1,200.

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:38.960
And then m is our slope.

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:42.600
So that's the rate at which
our elevation is increasing.

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.380
And that's what we
calculated right over here.

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:47.750
Our slope is 125 meters per hour.

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.190
So notice, these are equivalent.

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:51.760
I just have, these two terms are swapped.

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.080
So we could either write
y is equal to 1,200

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:59.470
plus 125x or you could write
it the other way around.

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:04.030
You could write 125x plus 1,200.

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:05.513
They are equivalent.
