00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:32.900 align:start position:0%
well that's meant to be false so it
 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:34.540 align:start position:0%
well that's meant to be false so it

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:34.550 align:start position:0%
means the one on the other side is also
 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:37.000 align:start position:0%
means the one on the other side is also
false<00:01:35.060><c> oh</c><00:01:35.540><c> but</c><00:01:36.140><c> we</c><00:01:36.230><c> suppose</c><00:01:36.560><c> that</c><00:01:36.590><c> that</c><00:01:36.830><c> was</c>

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:39.280 align:start position:0%

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:39.290 align:start position:0%
true so that's false so the other side
 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:41.230 align:start position:0%
true so that's false so the other side
is<00:01:39.410><c> true</c><00:01:39.890><c> which</c><00:01:40.220><c> means</c><00:01:40.250><c> that</c><00:01:40.580><c> and</c><00:01:40.940><c> you</c><00:01:41.120><c> get</c>

00:07:56.589 --> 00:07:56.599 align:start position:0%
this is actually something that has a

this is actually something that has a

00:08:05.439 --> 00:08:05.449 align:start position:0%
mathematical equation now this means
 

00:08:05.449 --> 00:08:07.689 align:start position:0%
mathematical equation now this means

00:08:07.689 --> 00:08:07.699 align:start position:0%
because it's an equation in mathematics
 

00:08:07.699 --> 00:08:12.069 align:start position:0%
because it's an equation in mathematics
it's<00:08:08.389><c> either</c><00:08:08.659><c> true</c><00:08:08.959><c> or</c><00:08:09.349><c> its</c><00:08:09.649><c> false</c><00:08:10.389><c> so</c><00:08:11.389><c> let's</c>

00:08:12.069 --> 00:08:12.079 align:start position:0%
it's either true or its false so let's
 

00:08:12.079 --> 00:08:15.429 align:start position:0%
it's either true or its false so let's
start<00:08:12.679><c> by</c><00:08:13.089><c> saying</c><00:08:14.089><c> that</c><00:08:14.419><c> the</c><00:08:14.809><c> statement</c><00:08:15.259><c> is</c>

00:08:15.429 --> 00:08:15.439 align:start position:0%
start by saying that the statement is
 

00:08:15.439 --> 00:08:18.179 align:start position:0%
start by saying that the statement is
false<00:08:15.739><c> that</c><00:08:16.399><c> means</c><00:08:16.459><c> that</c><00:08:16.939><c> this</c><00:08:17.299><c> statement</c><00:08:17.629><c> is</c>

00:08:18.179 --> 00:08:18.189 align:start position:0%
false that means that this statement is
 

00:08:18.189 --> 00:08:21.249 align:start position:0%
false that means that this statement is
provable<00:08:19.189><c> from</c><00:08:19.549><c> the</c><00:08:19.669><c> axioms</c><00:08:20.179><c> is</c><00:08:20.389><c> true</c><00:08:20.839><c> but</c><00:08:21.229><c> a</c>

00:08:21.249 --> 00:08:21.259 align:start position:0%
provable from the axioms is true but a
 

00:08:21.259 --> 00:08:24.909 align:start position:0%
provable from the axioms is true but a
provable<00:08:22.129><c> statement</c><00:08:22.819><c> must</c><00:08:23.239><c> be</c><00:08:23.419><c> true</c><00:08:23.749><c> so</c><00:08:24.649><c> now</c>

00:08:24.909 --> 00:08:24.919 align:start position:0%
provable statement must be true so now
 

00:08:24.919 --> 00:08:26.889 align:start position:0%
provable statement must be true so now
we've<00:08:25.549><c> started</c><00:08:26.209><c> with</c><00:08:26.389><c> something</c><00:08:26.659><c> which</c><00:08:26.749><c> we</c>

00:08:26.889 --> 00:08:26.899 align:start position:0%
we've started with something which we
 

00:08:26.899 --> 00:08:28.719 align:start position:0%
we've started with something which we
assumed<00:08:27.169><c> was</c><00:08:27.289><c> false</c><00:08:27.589><c> and</c><00:08:27.799><c> now</c><00:08:28.339><c> we've</c><00:08:28.519><c> deduced</c>

00:08:28.719 --> 00:08:28.729 align:start position:0%
assumed was false and now we've deduced
 

00:08:28.729 --> 00:08:30.549 align:start position:0%
assumed was false and now we've deduced
that<00:08:29.389><c> it's</c><00:08:29.599><c> true</c><00:08:29.989><c> so</c><00:08:30.289><c> we've</c><00:08:30.409><c> got</c><00:08:30.529><c> a</c>

00:08:30.549 --> 00:08:30.559 align:start position:0%
that it's true so we've got a
 

00:08:30.559 --> 00:08:32.290 align:start position:0%
that it's true so we've got a

00:08:32.290 --> 00:08:32.300 align:start position:0%
contradiction and we're assuming that
 

00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:34.779 align:start position:0%
contradiction and we're assuming that

00:08:34.779 --> 00:08:34.789 align:start position:0%
mathematics is consistent so we can't
 

00:08:34.789 --> 00:08:37.179 align:start position:0%
mathematics is consistent so we can't

00:08:37.179 --> 00:08:37.189 align:start position:0%
have contradictions this is important so
 

00:08:37.189 --> 00:08:40.480 align:start position:0%
have contradictions this is important so
that<00:08:37.430><c> means</c><00:08:37.669><c> it</c><00:08:37.849><c> can't</c><00:08:38.180><c> be</c><00:08:38.389><c> false</c><00:08:39.199><c> this</c><00:08:40.189><c> means</c>

00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:40.490 align:start position:0%
that means it can't be false this means
 

00:08:40.490 --> 00:08:42.999 align:start position:0%
that means it can't be false this means
it<00:08:40.729><c> must</c><00:08:41.089><c> be</c><00:08:41.419><c> true</c><00:08:41.689><c> because</c><00:08:41.959><c> a</c><00:08:42.409><c> mathematical</c>
