00:00:12.944 --> 00:00:14.967
I want to talk to you tonight

00:00:14.991 --> 00:00:18.227
about the work that makes
all other work possible,

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:23.638
about the millions of women
who go to work in our homes

00:00:23.662 --> 00:00:25.843
every single day,

00:00:25.867 --> 00:00:29.648
caring for children as nannies,

00:00:29.672 --> 00:00:33.142
caring for our loved ones
with disabilities and our elders,

00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:34.754
as home care workers,

00:00:35.596 --> 00:00:39.474
maintaining sanity
in our homes as cleaners.

00:00:39.498 --> 00:00:42.440
It's the work that makes
all other work possible.

00:00:43.472 --> 00:00:47.040
And it's mostly done by women,
more than 90 percent women,

00:00:47.064 --> 00:00:49.259
disproportionately women of color.

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:55.376
And the work itself is associated with
work that women have historically done,

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.602
work that's been made incredibly invisible

00:00:58.626 --> 00:01:01.220
and taken for granted in our culture.

00:01:02.228 --> 00:01:06.852
But it's so fundamental
to everything else in our world.

00:01:06.876 --> 00:01:11.594
It makes it possible for all of us
to go out and do what we do in the world

00:01:11.618 --> 00:01:12.936
every single day,

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.183
knowing that the most precious aspects
of our lives are in good hands.

00:01:19.239 --> 00:01:21.318
But we don't think about it that way.

00:01:22.026 --> 00:01:25.547
It's almost defined by its invisibility.

00:01:26.483 --> 00:01:28.166
You could go into any neighborhood

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:31.362
and not know which homes
are also workplaces.

00:01:31.386 --> 00:01:32.958
There's no sign.

00:01:32.982 --> 00:01:35.902
There's no list or registry.

00:01:35.926 --> 00:01:37.466
It's just invisible.

00:01:39.791 --> 00:01:45.774
And it's this work that is not even
referred to as real work.

00:01:45.798 --> 00:01:48.070
It's referred to as "help."

00:01:48.681 --> 00:01:51.885
It's often seen as unskilled,

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:53.925
not seen as professional.

00:01:55.631 --> 00:02:01.357
And race has played a profound role
in how we value this work in our culture.

00:02:01.381 --> 00:02:04.809
Some of the first domestic workers
in the United States were black women

00:02:04.833 --> 00:02:06.253
who were enslaved,

00:02:06.277 --> 00:02:10.370
and racial exclusion has shaped
their conditions for generations.

00:02:11.066 --> 00:02:14.555
In the 1930s, when Congress
was discussing the labor laws

00:02:14.579 --> 00:02:16.730
that would be a part of the New Deal,

00:02:16.754 --> 00:02:19.090
that would protect all workers,

00:02:19.114 --> 00:02:23.880
Southern members of Congress
refused to support those labor laws

00:02:23.904 --> 00:02:28.707
if they included protections
for domestic workers and farmworkers.

00:02:29.503 --> 00:02:32.764
That history of racial exclusion

00:02:32.788 --> 00:02:37.775
and our cultural devaluing of work
that's associated with women

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:42.074
now means that millions of women
go to work every single day,

00:02:42.098 --> 00:02:43.781
work incredibly hard

00:02:43.805 --> 00:02:45.903
and still can't make ends meet.

00:02:46.639 --> 00:02:51.519
They earn poverty wages
without a safety net,

00:02:51.543 --> 00:02:57.386
so that the women that we're counting on
to take care of us and our families

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:00.402
can't take care of their own,
doing this work.

00:03:01.983 --> 00:03:07.233
But my work over the last 20 years
has been about changing precisely that.

00:03:07.257 --> 00:03:11.463
It's about making these jobs good jobs
that you can take pride in

00:03:11.487 --> 00:03:13.259
and support your family on.

00:03:13.835 --> 00:03:17.471
At the National Domestic Workers Alliance,
we've been working hard in states

00:03:17.495 --> 00:03:22.559
to pass new laws that will protect
domestic workers from discrimination

00:03:22.583 --> 00:03:24.709
and sexual harassment,

00:03:24.733 --> 00:03:28.959
that will create days of rest,
paid time off, even.

00:03:29.766 --> 00:03:34.206
So far, eight states have passed
domestic workers bills of rights.

00:03:35.412 --> 00:03:36.590
Yes.

00:03:36.614 --> 00:03:40.317
(Applause)

00:03:40.341 --> 00:03:42.135
And during the Obama administration,

00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:46.136
we were successful in bringing
two million home care workers

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.700
under minimum wage
and overtime protections

00:03:48.724 --> 00:03:52.563
for the first time since 1937.

00:03:52.587 --> 00:03:56.548
(Applause)

00:03:58.317 --> 00:04:03.823
Most recently, we've been really excited
to launch a new portable benefits platform

00:04:03.847 --> 00:04:06.507
for domestic workers, called "Alia,"

00:04:06.531 --> 00:04:10.154
which allows for domestic workers
with multiple clients

00:04:10.178 --> 00:04:14.472
to give them access to benefits
for the very first time.

00:04:15.554 --> 00:04:19.072
So really important progress
is being made.

00:04:19.794 --> 00:04:22.233
But I would argue tonight

00:04:22.257 --> 00:04:27.484
that one of the most important things
that domestic workers can provide

00:04:27.508 --> 00:04:30.033
is actually what they can teach us

00:04:30.057 --> 00:04:32.179
about humanity itself

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:38.260
and about what it will take to create
a more humane world for our children.

00:04:39.774 --> 00:04:42.533
In the face of extreme immorality,

00:04:42.557 --> 00:04:46.516
domestic workers can be our moral compass.

00:04:47.309 --> 00:04:49.227
And it makes sense,

00:04:49.251 --> 00:04:52.157
because what they do is so fundamental

00:04:52.181 --> 00:04:56.485
to the very basics
of human need and humanity.

00:04:57.184 --> 00:05:00.987
They are there when we
are born into this world;

00:05:01.011 --> 00:05:04.857
they shape who we become in this world;

00:05:05.611 --> 00:05:10.025
and they are with us
as we prepare to leave this world.

00:05:11.215 --> 00:05:14.720
And their experiences
with families are so varied.

00:05:14.744 --> 00:05:17.818
They have some relationships
with the families that they work for

00:05:17.842 --> 00:05:20.950
that are incredibly positive
and mutually supportive

00:05:20.974 --> 00:05:22.932
and last for years and years.

00:05:22.956 --> 00:05:25.631
And then the opposite also happens.

00:05:26.209 --> 00:05:30.905
And we've seen cases
of sexual violence and assault,

00:05:30.929 --> 00:05:34.575
of extreme forms
of abuse and exploitation.

00:05:35.753 --> 00:05:38.483
We've seen cases of human trafficking.

00:05:39.696 --> 00:05:42.934
Domestic workers live
in poor neighborhoods,

00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:46.993
and then they go to work
in very wealthy ones.

00:05:48.112 --> 00:05:54.102
They cross cultures and generations
and borders and boundaries,

00:05:54.126 --> 00:05:57.251
and their job, no matter what,

00:05:57.275 --> 00:06:00.150
is to show up and care --

00:06:01.872 --> 00:06:07.233
to nurture, to feed, to clothe, to bathe,

00:06:08.406 --> 00:06:11.907
to listen, to encourage,

00:06:12.908 --> 00:06:14.790
to ensure safety,

00:06:15.415 --> 00:06:17.212
to support dignity ...

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:20.776
to care no matter what.

00:06:22.245 --> 00:06:25.779
I want to tell you a story of a woman
I met early on in this work.

00:06:25.803 --> 00:06:27.135
Her name is Lily.

00:06:28.309 --> 00:06:31.043
Lily and her family lived in Jamaica,

00:06:32.035 --> 00:06:35.791
and when she was 15 years old,
she was approached by an American couple

00:06:35.815 --> 00:06:38.649
who were looking for a live-in nanny
to come live with them

00:06:38.673 --> 00:06:39.824
in the United States

00:06:39.848 --> 00:06:41.732
and help them care for their children.

00:06:42.295 --> 00:06:47.422
They offered Lily's family that
if she came to work as their nanny,

00:06:47.446 --> 00:06:51.416
she would be able to have access
to a US education,

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:56.023
and she would have a weekly salary
sent home to help her family financially.

00:06:57.819 --> 00:06:59.756
They decided it was a good idea

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:02.674
and decided to take the opportunity.

00:07:04.184 --> 00:07:06.840
Lily held up her end of the bargain

00:07:08.125 --> 00:07:10.386
and helped to raise three children.

00:07:11.957 --> 00:07:15.580
But all communication
with her family was severed:

00:07:15.604 --> 00:07:18.641
no letters, no phone calls.

00:07:18.665 --> 00:07:21.188
She was never allowed to go to school,

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:24.205
and she was never paid --

00:07:24.229 --> 00:07:26.585
for 15 years.

00:07:27.804 --> 00:07:31.488
One day, she saw an article in a newspaper
about another domestic worker

00:07:31.512 --> 00:07:33.961
with a really similar story to hers,

00:07:33.985 --> 00:07:36.731
another case that I was
working on at the time,

00:07:36.755 --> 00:07:38.752
and she found a way to reach me.

00:07:39.777 --> 00:07:42.399
She also found a way to reach her brother,

00:07:42.423 --> 00:07:45.174
who was living in the United States
at the time as well.

00:07:45.198 --> 00:07:48.488
Between the two of us,
we were able to help her escape.

00:07:49.525 --> 00:07:52.476
And she had the help
of one of the children.

00:07:53.071 --> 00:07:56.895
One of the children
was old enough to realize

00:07:56.919 --> 00:08:01.074
that the way his nanny
was being treated was wrong,

00:08:01.098 --> 00:08:04.476
and he gave her the money that he
had been saving through his childhood

00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:05.733
to help her escape.

00:08:07.304 --> 00:08:09.480
But here's the thing about this story.

00:08:12.210 --> 00:08:16.806
She was essentially enslaved for 15 years.

00:08:18.248 --> 00:08:21.548
Human trafficking and slavery
is a criminal offense.

00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:25.180
And so her lawyers and I asked Lily,

00:08:25.204 --> 00:08:28.985
did she want to press criminal charges
for what had happened to her.

00:08:29.731 --> 00:08:32.696
And after thinking about
what it would mean,

00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:34.309
she said no,

00:08:35.222 --> 00:08:39.457
because she didn't want the children
to be separated from their parents.

00:08:42.113 --> 00:08:46.562
Instead, we filed a civil lawsuit,
and we eventually won the case,

00:08:46.586 --> 00:08:50.287
and her case became a rallying cry
for domestic workers everywhere.

00:08:50.311 --> 00:08:54.877
She was reunited with her family
and went on to have a family of her own.

00:08:55.909 --> 00:08:59.255
But the thing that's so profound
to me about this story

00:08:59.279 --> 00:09:04.190
is, despite having 15 years
stolen from her life,

00:09:04.214 --> 00:09:09.998
it did not affect the care and compassion
that she felt for the children.

00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:14.259
And I see this from domestic
workers all the time.

00:09:14.283 --> 00:09:16.170
In the face of indignities

00:09:16.194 --> 00:09:19.985
and our failure to respect and value
this work in our culture,

00:09:20.009 --> 00:09:22.299
they still show up,

00:09:22.323 --> 00:09:23.776
and they care.

00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:28.369
They're simply too proximate
to our shared humanity.

00:09:28.393 --> 00:09:31.552
They know how your toddler
likes to be held

00:09:31.576 --> 00:09:33.980
as they take their bottle before a nap.

00:09:35.011 --> 00:09:37.781
They know how your mother likes her tea,

00:09:37.805 --> 00:09:41.876
how to make her smile and tell stories
despite her dementia.

00:09:42.924 --> 00:09:46.640
They are so proximate to our humanity.

00:09:47.688 --> 00:09:49.839
They know that at the end of the day,

00:09:49.863 --> 00:09:52.967
these are people
who are part of families --

00:09:52.991 --> 00:09:54.852
someone's mother,

00:09:54.876 --> 00:09:57.127
someone's grandmother,

00:09:57.151 --> 00:09:59.601
someone's best friend

00:09:59.625 --> 00:10:01.765
and someone's baby;

00:10:03.773 --> 00:10:05.878
undeniably human,

00:10:06.656 --> 00:10:09.747
and therefore, not disposable.

00:10:11.715 --> 00:10:18.236
Domestic workers know that any time
a single person becomes disposable,

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:20.002
it's a slippery slope.

00:10:21.284 --> 00:10:25.238
You see, the cultural devaluing
of domestic work

00:10:25.262 --> 00:10:29.238
is a reflection
of a hierarchy of human value

00:10:29.262 --> 00:10:31.674
that defines everything in our world,

00:10:32.549 --> 00:10:36.465
a hierarchy that values
the lives and contributions

00:10:36.489 --> 00:10:39.683
of some groups of people over others,

00:10:40.714 --> 00:10:44.292
based on race, gender,

00:10:44.316 --> 00:10:47.949
class, immigration status --

00:10:47.973 --> 00:10:50.212
any number of categories.

00:10:51.514 --> 00:10:58.198
And that hierarchy of human value requires
stories about those groups of people

00:10:58.222 --> 00:11:00.915
in order to sustain itself.

00:11:00.939 --> 00:11:04.050
So these stories have seeped
deep into our culture

00:11:04.074 --> 00:11:08.455
about how some people
are less intelligent,

00:11:08.479 --> 00:11:11.716
some people are less intuitive,

00:11:13.081 --> 00:11:14.901
weaker,

00:11:14.925 --> 00:11:18.737
by extension, less trustworthy,

00:11:19.371 --> 00:11:20.739
less valuable

00:11:21.652 --> 00:11:23.441
and ultimately,

00:11:23.465 --> 00:11:25.010
less human.

00:11:26.448 --> 00:11:30.665
And domestic workers know
it's a slippery slope

00:11:30.689 --> 00:11:37.339
when we start to see a worker
as less than a real worker,

00:11:38.318 --> 00:11:41.644
to a woman as less than a woman,

00:11:42.367 --> 00:11:46.278
to a mother as less than a mother,

00:11:47.365 --> 00:11:50.750
to a child as less than a child.

00:11:52.519 --> 00:11:54.119
In the spring of 2018,

00:11:54.143 --> 00:11:58.837
the Trump administration announced
a new policy at the US-Mexico border,

00:11:58.861 --> 00:12:01.297
a zero-tolerance policy,

00:12:01.321 --> 00:12:06.162
to forcibly separate all children
from their parents,

00:12:06.186 --> 00:12:09.439
who were arriving at the border
seeking asylum;

00:12:09.463 --> 00:12:13.496
children as young as 18 months,
separated from their parents

00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:18.608
after a long and arduous journey
to reach the US-Mexico border

00:12:18.632 --> 00:12:21.537
in search of safety and a new beginning.

00:12:22.542 --> 00:12:25.017
Thousands of children separated.

00:12:26.765 --> 00:12:29.545
And because they were migrants,

00:12:29.569 --> 00:12:33.041
they were treated as less than children.

00:12:35.446 --> 00:12:39.943
In response, I helped to organize
the Families Belong Together Vigil

00:12:39.967 --> 00:12:44.216
at the Ursula Border Patrol
Processing Center in McAllen, Texas,

00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:45.478
on Father's Day.

00:12:46.065 --> 00:12:49.359
Inside that processing center,
there were hundreds of children

00:12:49.383 --> 00:12:52.111
who were being held, processed

00:12:52.135 --> 00:12:55.335
and then prepared to be
shipped all over country

00:12:55.359 --> 00:13:00.547
to be jailed in facilities
hundreds of miles away from their parents.

00:13:01.522 --> 00:13:03.683
I saw with my own eyes

00:13:03.707 --> 00:13:06.575
children not [old] enough for kindergarten

00:13:06.599 --> 00:13:08.084
in unmarked buses,

00:13:08.108 --> 00:13:12.373
being shipped off to jails
hundreds of miles away.

00:13:13.904 --> 00:13:16.587
And as they passed us by,

00:13:16.611 --> 00:13:19.089
they reached for us through the windows,

00:13:21.485 --> 00:13:25.333
as we stood vigil to let them know
that they are not alone,

00:13:25.357 --> 00:13:27.001
and we are fighting for them.

00:13:27.906 --> 00:13:32.237
Domestic workers came from all over Texas
to be a part of the vigil.

00:13:32.261 --> 00:13:36.827
They saw in those families
their own family stories.

00:13:36.851 --> 00:13:42.646
They had also come here
in search of safety and a new beginning,

00:13:42.670 --> 00:13:44.246
a better life for their families,

00:13:44.270 --> 00:13:47.939
and they saw in the eyes of those children

00:13:47.963 --> 00:13:49.514
their own children.

00:13:51.052 --> 00:13:52.872
And through our tears,

00:13:53.650 --> 00:13:56.527
we looked at each other
and we asked each other,

00:13:56.551 --> 00:13:58.621
"How did we get here,

00:13:59.732 --> 00:14:02.526
to putting children in cages

00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:06.476
and separating them from the people
who love them the most in the world?"

00:14:07.159 --> 00:14:08.570
How?

00:14:10.171 --> 00:14:16.104
And what I thought to myself was:
if domestic workers were in charge,

00:14:16.128 --> 00:14:17.932
this never would have happened.

00:14:18.916 --> 00:14:23.846
Our humanity would never
have been so disposable

00:14:23.870 --> 00:14:26.543
that we would be treating
children in this way.

00:14:29.304 --> 00:14:35.084
The Dalai Lama once said
that love and compassion are necessities,

00:14:35.877 --> 00:14:37.525
not luxuries.

00:14:38.597 --> 00:14:42.237
Without them, humanity cannot survive.

00:14:44.341 --> 00:14:48.104
In other words, they are fundamental
to human existence.

00:14:49.644 --> 00:14:54.639
Domestic workers are in charge
of the fundamentals.

00:14:55.980 --> 00:14:57.992
They love and they care,

00:14:58.016 --> 00:15:00.993
and they show compassion no matter what.

00:15:04.016 --> 00:15:08.441
We live in a time of moral choices

00:15:09.417 --> 00:15:11.077
everywhere we turn:

00:15:11.101 --> 00:15:12.755
at the border,

00:15:12.779 --> 00:15:14.999
at the ballot box,

00:15:15.023 --> 00:15:16.898
in our workplaces,

00:15:17.930 --> 00:15:21.473
right in our homes, full of moral choices.

00:15:23.267 --> 00:15:29.273
As you go about your day
and you encounter these moral choices,

00:15:29.297 --> 00:15:30.799
think of Lily.

00:15:32.323 --> 00:15:33.948
Think like Lily.

00:15:35.083 --> 00:15:41.530
Think like a domestic worker
who shows up and cares no matter what.

00:15:42.228 --> 00:15:45.161
Love and compassion, no matter what.

00:15:46.461 --> 00:15:48.839
Show up like a domestic worker,

00:15:51.164 --> 00:15:53.792
because our children are counting on us.

00:15:54.537 --> 00:15:55.708
Thank you.

00:15:55.732 --> 00:15:59.362
(Applause)
