00:00:00.436 --> 00:00:04.021
- Kali is having a picnic
for her six friends.

00:00:04.021 --> 00:00:06.842
The oldest friend,
Vikram, is 10 years old.

00:00:06.842 --> 00:00:09.907
The youngest, Diya, is six years old.

00:00:09.907 --> 00:00:12.020
She has a total of 48 blueberries

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:13.808
and wants to split them evenly

00:00:13.808 --> 00:00:15.480
between her friends.

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.928
How many blueberries does each friend get?

00:00:18.928 --> 00:00:20.019
And I encourage you to now,

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:21.307
pause this video

00:00:21.307 --> 00:00:22.688
and try to figure it out on your own.

00:00:22.688 --> 00:00:26.763
How many blueberries does each friend get?

00:00:26.763 --> 00:00:28.226
Let's think about this a little bit.

00:00:28.226 --> 00:00:30.606
So she has six friends.

00:00:30.606 --> 00:00:31.684
She has six friends

00:00:31.684 --> 00:00:33.438
and she wants them all

00:00:33.438 --> 00:00:35.587
to be able to get the same amount.

00:00:35.587 --> 00:00:38.721
So, she wants to split
the 48 blueberries evenly

00:00:38.721 --> 00:00:39.939
amongst her six friends.

00:00:39.939 --> 00:00:42.145
The ages of her friends don't matter.

00:00:42.145 --> 00:00:44.689
So, she's going to take
the 48 blueberries.

00:00:44.689 --> 00:00:46.661
She's going to take the 48 blueberries

00:00:46.661 --> 00:00:48.565
and divide it,

00:00:48.565 --> 00:00:50.237
and divide it

00:00:50.237 --> 00:00:51.305
by six.

00:00:51.305 --> 00:00:53.882
She wants to divide it into six groups.

00:00:53.882 --> 00:00:57.806
So she wants to divide it into six groups.

00:00:57.806 --> 00:01:00.337
48 divided by 6.

00:01:00.337 --> 00:01:01.713
And so this,

00:01:01.713 --> 00:01:03.065
so question mark,

00:01:03.065 --> 00:01:06.060
is going to be equal to
the number of blueberries

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.834
that each friend gets.

00:01:08.834 --> 00:01:11.922
So 48 divided by six is
equal to question mark,

00:01:11.922 --> 00:01:13.954
is the same thing as saying

00:01:13.954 --> 00:01:16.044
that 48,

00:01:16.044 --> 00:01:18.621
48 is equal to,

00:01:18.621 --> 00:01:23.044
is equal to question mark times six,

00:01:23.044 --> 00:01:24.623
times six.

00:01:24.623 --> 00:01:25.760
So if we could figure out

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:28.117
what number we can multiply by six

00:01:28.117 --> 00:01:29.813
to get 48,

00:01:29.813 --> 00:01:32.598
then we know what 48 divided by six

00:01:32.598 --> 00:01:33.921
actually is.

00:01:33.921 --> 00:01:35.361
For example, this question mark,

00:01:35.361 --> 00:01:37.416
this is the number of
blueberries per friend.

00:01:37.416 --> 00:01:41.653
The number of blueberries
per friend times six friends,

00:01:41.653 --> 00:01:43.777
well that should tell us the
total number of blueberries,

00:01:43.777 --> 00:01:45.542
which is 48.

00:01:45.542 --> 00:01:47.562
So what is this number?

00:01:47.562 --> 00:01:48.560
Well, let's think about,

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:49.512
let's just think about

00:01:49.512 --> 00:01:51.857
all of the multiples of six.

00:01:51.857 --> 00:01:56.177
So, six times one is equal to six.

00:01:56.177 --> 00:01:59.357
Six times two is equal to 12.

00:01:59.357 --> 00:02:02.178
And really we're just
increasing by six each time.

00:02:02.178 --> 00:02:04.534
We're just increasing by six.

00:02:04.534 --> 00:02:07.878
Six times three is equal to 18.

00:02:07.878 --> 00:02:10.954
Six times four is equal to 24.

00:02:10.954 --> 00:02:15.099
Six times five is equal to 30.

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:18.697
Six times six is equal to 36.

00:02:18.697 --> 00:02:21.495
Six times seven is equal to 42.

00:02:21.495 --> 00:02:23.573
Notice we're just adding six every time.

00:02:23.573 --> 00:02:27.834
Six times eight is equal to 48.

00:02:27.834 --> 00:02:29.993
Is equal to 48.

00:02:29.993 --> 00:02:32.350
So we now know that question mark,

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:35.948
we now know that the
question mark must be eight.

00:02:35.948 --> 00:02:36.889
Six times eight

00:02:36.889 --> 00:02:38.793
and eight times six is the same thing.

00:02:38.793 --> 00:02:40.155
So this is going to be equal

00:02:40.155 --> 00:02:42.716
to six times question mark.

00:02:42.716 --> 00:02:46.408
Six times question mark

00:02:46.408 --> 00:02:47.569
and now we learned

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:50.332
that question mark is equal to 48.

00:02:50.332 --> 00:02:53.246
Sorry, question mark is equal to eight.

00:02:53.246 --> 00:02:54.407
So, each of her friends

00:02:54.407 --> 00:02:56.473
are going to get eight blueberries.

00:02:56.473 --> 00:02:57.588
So this is, right over here,

00:02:57.588 --> 00:03:02.588
48 divided by six is equal
to eight blueberries.

00:03:03.973 --> 00:03:05.807
Now, let's verify that.

00:03:05.807 --> 00:03:08.233
We have 48 blueberries right over here.

00:03:08.233 --> 00:03:10.474
Lets divide them into six groups

00:03:10.474 --> 00:03:13.852
where each group is going
to have eight blueberries.

00:03:13.852 --> 00:03:15.024
So let me do my best.

00:03:15.024 --> 00:03:17.385
So let's see, this is one, two,

00:03:17.385 --> 00:03:22.385
three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:25.426
So, that's a group of eight blueberries.

00:03:25.426 --> 00:03:28.630
See, here's another group
of eight blueberries,

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:30.627
right over here.

00:03:30.627 --> 00:03:33.610
And there's another
group, right over here,

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:35.944
of eight blueberries.

00:03:35.944 --> 00:03:37.929
And then, here's our fourth group

00:03:37.929 --> 00:03:40.193
of eight blueberries.

00:03:40.193 --> 00:03:40.912
And now, let's see,

00:03:40.912 --> 00:03:43.052
we can make a fifth group

00:03:43.052 --> 00:03:45.544
of eight blueberries.

00:03:45.544 --> 00:03:47.425
Fifth group of eight blueberries.

00:03:47.425 --> 00:03:48.390
And then, finally,

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:50.722
here is our sixth group.

00:03:50.722 --> 00:03:51.987
Here is our sixth group

00:03:51.987 --> 00:03:54.031
of eight blueberries.

00:03:54.031 --> 00:03:54.729
So notice,

00:03:54.729 --> 00:03:56.921
we have six groups of eight blueberries.

00:03:56.921 --> 00:03:58.349
Each of her six friends

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:00.160
could take one of these groups

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:01.873
of eight blueberries.
