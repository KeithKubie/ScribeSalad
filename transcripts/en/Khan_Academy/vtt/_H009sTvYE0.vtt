00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:04.000
Using all of the major
components in oil of cloves.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.700
It has a molar mass of 164.2
grams per mole, and is 73.14%

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:14.710
carbon, and 7.37% hydrogen.

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:16.140
The remainder is oxygen.

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:17.940
What are the empirical
and molecular

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.660
formulas for eugenol?

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:22.370
And just as a refresher,
empirical formula is the

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:25.300
simplest ratio of the atoms
in the molecule.

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:26.450
And we'll see that
in a second.

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:30.300
And the molecular formula is the
actual number of atoms in

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:30.715
the molecule.

00:00:30.715 --> 00:00:32.640
So let's see if we can
figure this out.

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.840
So the first piece of
information they gave us is

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.430
that, the molar mass
of eugenol is

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:42.220
164.2 grams per mole.

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:47.480
So just to simplify things in
our head, let's just assume

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:56.100
that we have 1 mole
of eugenol.

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.190
And just as a bit of a
refresher, a mole is just a

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.570
huge number.

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.760
It's like saying we have a
million molecules of eugenol,

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:06.750
but a mole is just an
even bigger number.

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.310
And we know that the molar mass
of eugenol-- if we have

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:13.090
that many molecules of eugenol,
then since we have 1

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:17.180
mole, we know that, that is
going to have a mass of 164.2

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:19.450
grams. So another way to
say it is, we have

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:26.500
164.2 grams of eugenol.

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.020
Now they gave us the
composition.

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.970
They tell us what percentage
is carbon, what's hydrogen,

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.750
and the remainder is oxygen.

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:35.480
So if we assume we have a mole
of eugenol and we know that

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:40.460
mole will have a mass of 164.2
grams, we can just use the

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.580
percentages to figure out what
is our mass of carbon,

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:44.880
hydrogen, and oxygen.

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.380
So let's figure this out.

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.840
So let's start off with this.

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:57.750
So 164.2 grams of eugenol
times-- let me do it in

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:03.630
another color-- times 73.14%.

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.950
This will tell us what is our
mass of carbon that we're

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:08.080
dealing with.

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.139
So let's figure this out.

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:13.990
So our mass of carbon-- get
the calculator up here.

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:23.210
All right, so we have 164.2
times-- so 73.14% is the same

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:27.780
thing as 0.7314.

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.920
So we have 120.1.

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.080
Let's go with that.

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.690
We have four significant
digits in each of these

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:40.180
numbers, so let's just go with
120.1 grams of carbon.

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:47.280
So this is 120.1 grams
of carbon.

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:48.560
Now let's do the same
thing for the

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:49.750
hydrogen and the oxygen.

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:58.070
So we have 164.2 grams of
eugenol times-- what's our

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:59.450
percent composition
of hydrogen?

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:06.340
It's right here, 7.37%--
so times 7.37%.

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:08.620
What is this going
to be equal to?

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:09.910
Get the calculator out.

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:19.240
So we have 164.2 times--
7.37% is 0.0737.

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:23.200
And we will get 12.1.

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.660
So we have 12.1 grams
of carbon.

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:33.050
And they don't give us,
explicitly, the percent

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:34.220
composition of oxygen.

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:36.610
But we could figure it out
fairly easily, because we know

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:38.780
everything left over
is oxygen.

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:42.100
So we could take the mass of
carbon, the mass of hydrogen--

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:44.590
oh sorry, this isn't
grams of carbon.

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:46.220
That's grams of hydrogen.

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:49.400
We could take the mass of
hydrogen, the mass of carbon,

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:53.660
subtract them both from 164.2,
and whatever is left

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:55.060
over will be oxygen.

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:56.570
So let's do it that way.

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:58.590
Or we could figure out the
percentage that's oxygen,

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:01.250
because these all have to add up
to 100%, and then multiply.

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:03.180
Either way would work.

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:04.290
So let's do that.

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:10.540
So if we have 1 mole of eugenol,
it's 164.2 grams. We

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:17.769
just figured out that 120.1 of
those grams are carbon, and

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:24.330
that 12.1 of those grams
are hydrogen.

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:25.100
So what's left over?

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:30.170
We have exactly 32
grams of oxygen.

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:32.840
So what's left over when you
subtract these two guys out?

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:36.600
I'll do that in green.

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:40.980
We are left with 32
grams of oxygen.

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:43.860
So if you have a mole of
eugenol, it has a mass of

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:47.650
164.2 grams. And if you break
it down by the masses of the

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:52.060
constituent molecules, 120 grams
of carbon, 12 grams of

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:55.050
hydrogen, 32 grams of oxygen.

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:57.820
Now what we need to do is figure
out how many moles of

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:01.310
carbon this is, how many moles
of hydrogen this is, and how

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:03.440
many moles of oxygen.

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:06.780
And this is maybe something that
you should have memorized

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:09.210
at some point, because these
are the three most common

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:11.030
elements you'll ever
deal with.

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:13.980
But just as a refresher, you
could look up on any periodic

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:18.710
table for carbon, you would see
in the periodic table the

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:21.920
atomis-- well, most periodic
tables will give you the

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:25.260
atomic weight, which is the
weighted average of the

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.130
different isotopes
of carbon around.

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:30.360
But in general, the atomic
weight, or the weighted

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:33.400
average of the atomic masses
of the different isotopes.

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:36.360
But carbon, you just remember
that the atomic weight is

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:42.300
pretty close to 12 atomic
mass units.

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:47.870
Which means, that carbon
has a molar mass of

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:50.760
12 grams per mole.

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:54.710
Or if you have a mole of carbon
molecules, it will have

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:58.370
a mass of 12 grams. We do the
same thing for the hydrogen

00:05:58.370 --> 00:05:59.740
and the oxygen.

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:04.770
Hydrogen has, whether you take
a single isotope or you take

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:07.650
the weighted average, its
atomic weight or mass,

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:12.540
depending which 1 you use, is
pretty darn close to 1.

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:17.980
And so hydrogen's molar mass
is 1 gram per mole.

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:19.950
There's some decimals here if
you look it up on a periodic

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:23.050
table, but I just remember
carbon as 12, hydrogen is 1,

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:26.410
and then finally,
oxygen is 16.

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:32.910
So oxygen's is approximately
16 atomic mass units.

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:35.460
I guess, if you take a specific
isotope, atomic mass.

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:37.760
If you take its weighted
average, atomic weight.

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:45.670
And that means that its molar
mass is 16 grams per mole.

00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:48.070
Now we have the number
of grams of oxygen,

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:49.940
hydrogen, and oxygen.

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:51.950
So now we should be able to use
this information down here

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:55.460
to figure out how many
moles this is.

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:56.620
So let's do this.

00:06:56.620 --> 00:07:02.060
So it's 12 grams per mole, but
we want to divide by grams

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:04.660
because we want this gram to
disappear in the numerator.

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:07.630
So what we could do is, if it's
12 grams per mole, that's

00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:16.090
the same thing as 1 mole for
every 12 grams. All I did is,

00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:17.860
I took the reciprocal
of this right here.

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:20.080
If we have 12 grams for every
mole, that's also true that we

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:22.800
have 1 mole for every
12 grams. And the

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:24.320
grams cancel out.

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:29.070
And we are left with 120.1
divided by 12, which is pretty

00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:31.730
close to 10.

00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:38.230
So this is equal to 10
moles of carbon.

00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:39.960
So we know how many moles
of carbon we have

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:41.920
in 1 mole of eugenol.

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:43.560
Now let's do the hydrogen.

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:45.160
So we do the multiplication
here.

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:49.510
And so here we have 1 mole of
hydrogen-- if we take the

00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:53.570
inverse of this, or the
reciprocal of this-- has a

00:07:53.570 --> 00:07:55.370
mass of 1 gram.

00:07:55.370 --> 00:07:57.390
So really, this is just
going to multiply out.

00:07:57.390 --> 00:08:01.170
So we literally have, we could
say 12.1 moles of hydrogen.

00:08:01.170 --> 00:08:04.810
But because we're looking for
formulas, that's pretty darn

00:08:04.810 --> 00:08:06.390
close to 12.

00:08:06.390 --> 00:08:10.860
So we should just say 12
moles of hydrogen.

00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:14.950
And then finally, we
have our oxygen.

00:08:14.950 --> 00:08:22.800
And we have 1 mole of oxygen for
every 16 grams of oxygen.

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:26.420
32 divided by-- the grams cancel
out, of course-- 32

00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:28.350
divided by 16 is 2.

00:08:28.350 --> 00:08:34.450
So this is equal to
2 moles of oxygen.

00:08:34.450 --> 00:08:37.190
So if we have 1 mole of eugenol,
we have 10 moles of

00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:40.990
carbon, 12 moles of hydrogen,
and 2 moles of oxygen.

00:08:40.990 --> 00:08:43.000
So we now have the ratio.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.020
Or you could even think of, if
you had 1 molecule of eugenol,

00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:55.700
we would have 10 carbons,
we have 12 hydrogens,

00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:56.950
and we have 2 oxygens.

00:08:59.770 --> 00:09:00.330
And we're done.

00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:05.010
This is the molecular formula
we have for every mole.

00:09:05.010 --> 00:09:06.860
We could think of it in moles
which is a huge number.

00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:09.270
Or you could think of, for every
molecule of eugenol, we

00:09:09.270 --> 00:09:12.480
have 10 molecules of carbon,
12 molecules of hydrogen, 6

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:14.710
molecules of oxygen.

00:09:14.710 --> 00:09:16.395
This right here is molecular
formula.

00:09:23.290 --> 00:09:26.040
And the empirical formula is
essentially taking this ratio

00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:28.600
to the simplest terms. And
all of these have a

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:30.230
common factor of 2.

00:09:30.230 --> 00:09:38.240
So the empirical formula, we
essentially just put this

00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:40.910
ratio in simplest terms. So we
can divide all of them by 2.

00:09:40.910 --> 00:09:42.780
So let's divide all
of them by 2.

00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:49.480
And you have 5 carbons for
every 6 hydrogens.

00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:50.290
This isn't O,6.

00:09:50.290 --> 00:09:51.550
This is 2 oxygens.

00:09:51.550 --> 00:09:52.800
So let me make that clear.

00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:57.770
I'll have to erase a lot
of stuff to get there.

00:09:57.770 --> 00:09:58.240
There you go.

00:09:58.240 --> 00:09:59.260
That was 2 oxygens.

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:00.320
Don't want to make
that blunder.

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:04.360
We saw we have 2 moles of
oxygen, so this is the

00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:05.610
molecular formula.

00:10:10.540 --> 00:10:15.930
And the empirical formula,
at least the 2 is still

00:10:15.930 --> 00:10:16.740
divisible by 2.

00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:18.820
So you divide all
of these by 2.

00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:20.570
You get the simplest ratio.

00:10:20.570 --> 00:10:27.590
For every 5 carbons, you
have 6 hydrogens,

00:10:27.590 --> 00:10:29.260
and you have 1 oxygen.

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:31.640
Or you can put a 1 right
there if you like.

00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:33.240
And we're done.
