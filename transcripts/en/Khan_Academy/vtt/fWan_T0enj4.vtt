00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.080
Welcome to the presentation on
why, not how, borrowing works.

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:06.750
And I think this is very
important because a lot of

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.500
people who even know math
fairly well or have an advanced

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:15.630
degree still aren't completely
sure on why borrowing works.

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.710
That's the focus of
this presentation.

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:20.500
Let's say I have the
subtraction problem

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.450
1,000-- that's a 0.

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:31.840
1,005 minus 616.

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.050
What I'm going to do is I'm
going to write the same problem

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.300
in a slightly different way.

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.640
We could call this
the expanded form.

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.080
1,005-- what I'm going to do
is I'm going to separate

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.330
the digits out into
their respective places.

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:49.720
So that is equal to 1,000
plus let's say zero 100's

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:53.550
plus zero 10's plus 5.

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.830
1,005 is just 1,000
plus 0 plus 0 plus 5.

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:00.340
And then that's minus 616.

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:08.910
So that's minus 600
minus 10 minus 6.

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:13.440
616 could be rewritten
as 600 plus 10 plus 6.

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.150
And I put a minus there
because we're subtracting

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.130
the whole thing.

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:18.940
So let's do this problem.

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:23.220
Well, if you're familiar with
how you borrow is, this 5 is

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.940
less than this 6, so we have to
somehow make this 5 a bigger

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:28.220
number so that we could
subtract the 6 from it.

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:31.060
Well, we know from traditional
borrowing that we have to

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.890
borrow 1 from someplace and
make this it into a 15.

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:36.240
But what I want to see
actually, is understand where

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.530
that 1 or actually where
that 10 comes from.

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:41.090
Because if you're turning this
5 into a 15 you actually

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:43.090
have to add 10 to it.

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.550
Well, if we look at this top
number, the only place that

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:49.970
a 10 could come from is
here, is from this 1,000.

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:52.950
But what we're going to do
since this is the 1,000's

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.040
place, instead of borrowing 10
from here, which would make it

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.480
kind of a very messy problem,
I'm going to borrow

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.430
1,000 from here.

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:03.960
I'm going to get
rid of this 1,000.

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.110
And I have a 1,000 that
I took from this 1,000.

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:12.740
I have 1,000 now that
I can distribute into

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:14.790
these 3 buckets.

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.360
Into the 100's, 10's
and 1's buckets.

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.270
Well, we need 10 here,
so let's put 10 here.

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:24.320
So it's 10 plus 5
is equal to 15.

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:25.040
We got our 15.

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:32.030
If we took 10 from the 1,000
then we have 990 left.

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:37.960
So we could put 900
here and 90 here.

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:41.250
Notice, we just said-- so we
had 1,000 and we just rewrote

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.040
it as 900 plus 90 plus 10.

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.670
And we added this 10 to this 5.

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:47.670
And now we could do this
subtraction just how we

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.110
would do a normal problem.

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:52.710
15 minus 6 is 9.

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:56.300
90 minus 10 is 80.

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:00.730
900 minus 600 is 300.

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:06.550
So 300 plus 80 plus 9 is 389.

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:08.940
And let's see how we would have
done it traditionally and make

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:12.790
sure that it would have kind of
translated into the same way.

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:15.210
Well, the way I teach it and I
don't know if this is actually

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:20.440
the traditional way of teaching
borrowing, is I say, OK, I need

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:23.480
to turn this 5 into a 15.

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.220
So I have to borrow
a 1 from someplace.

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:26.840
Well, we know from this side of
the problem that we actually

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:28.630
borrowed a 10 because that's
why it turned to 15.

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:30.540
If we're going to borrow
1, I'd say, well, can I

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:31.660
borrow the 1 from the 0?

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:32.100
No.

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:33.730
Can I borrow the 1 from this 0?

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:34.440
No.

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.630
I could borrow it from
here, but I'm borrowing

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:38.980
it from 100, right?

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:43.110
So 100 minus 1 is 99.

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:44.500
So that's the how I do it.

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.560
And I say 15 minus 6 is 9.

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.370
9 minus 1 is 8.

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:51.570
And 9 minus 6 is 300.

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:55.600
So this way that I just did it
is clearly faster and, I guess

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:57.780
you could say it's easier, but
a lot of people might say, well

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.200
Sal, that looks like a
little bit of magic.

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.160
You just took that 5, put a 1
on it, and then you borrowed

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.600
a 1 from this 100 here.

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:07.080
But really, what I
did is right here.

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:12.600
I took 1,000 from this 1
and I redistributed that

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:17.050
1,000 amongst the 100's,
10's, and 1's place.

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:18.010
Let me do another example.

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:19.810
I think it might make it a
little bit more clearer

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:22.050
of why borrowing works.

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:26.820
Let me do a simpler problem.

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:29.210
I actually started off with a
problem that tends to confuse

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:30.670
the most number of people.

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:45.290
Let's say I had 732 minus-- Let
me do a fairly simple one.

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:46.573
Minus 23.

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:50.820
Sometimes those 3's
just come out weird.

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:55.120
Well, we just learned that's
the same thing as 700 plus

00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:03.240
30 plus 2 minus 20 minus 3.

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:07.150
Well, we see this 2, 2 is less
than 3, so we can't subtract.

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:09.050
Wouldn't it be great if we
could get a 10 from someplace?

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:10.870
We could get a 10 from here.

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:16.960
We make this into 20 and add
the 10 to the 2 and we get 12.

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:21.940
And notice, 700 plus 20
plus 12 is still 732.

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:24.420
So we really didn't change
the number up top at all.

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:28.520
We just redistributed its
quantity amongst the

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:29.200
different places.

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:30.260
And now we're ready
to subtract.

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.340
12 minus 3 is 9.

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:36.610
20 minus 20 is 0 and then you
just bring down the 700.

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:42.190
You get 700 plus 0 plus 9,
which is the same thing as 709.

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:45.260
And that's the reason why
this borrowing will work.

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.380
Well, we say, oh, let's
borrow 1 from the 3.

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:48.290
Makes it a 2.

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:49.750
This becomes a 12.

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:52.200
And then we subtract.

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:54.520
9 0 7.

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:57.370
Let's do another
problem, one last one.

00:05:57.370 --> 00:05:59.160
And once again, you don't
have to do it this way.

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:00.850
You don't have to every
time you do a subtraction

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:01.480
problem do it this way.

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:03.520
Although if you ever get
confused, you can do it this

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:05.700
way and you won't make a
mistake, and you'll actually

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:06.990
understand what you're doing.

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:08.930
But if you're on a test and you
have to do things really fast

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:10.860
you should do it the
conventional way.

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:13.570
But it takes a lot of practice
to make sure you never are

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:15.710
doing something improper.

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:16.390
And that's the problem.

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:18.280
People learn just the rules,
and then they forget the

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:19.980
rules, and then they
forgot how to do it.

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:22.620
If you learn what you're doing,
you'll never really forget it

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:26.230
because it should make
some sense to you.

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:28.000
Let's do another problem.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:35.970
If I had 512 minus 38.

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:38.350
Well, let's keep doing it
that way I just showed you.

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:45.020
That's the same thing
as 500 plus 10 plus

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:51.080
2 minus 30 minus 8.

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:52.130
Well, 2 is less than 8.

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:53.290
I need a 10 from someplace.

00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:55.290
Well, one option we can
do is we can just get

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:56.600
the 10 from here.

00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:58.720
So then that becomes 0.

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:00.220
And then this will become a 12.

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:05.370
Notice that 500 plus 0 plus
12, same thing as 512 still.

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:06.270
So we could subtract.

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:09.770
12 minus 8 is 4.

00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:14.860
But here we see this 0 is less
than 30, so we can't subtract.

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:17.290
But we can borrow from the 500.

00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:22.930
Well, all we need is 100, so if
we turn this into 100 then we

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:25.260
took the 100 from the 500.

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:28.070
This becomes 400.

00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:31.430
I just rewrote 500
as 400 plus 100.

00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:32.340
Now I can subtract.

00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:35.510
100 minus 30 is 70.

00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:38.790
Bring down the 400.

00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:42.560
And this is the
same thing as 474.

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:44.490
And the way you learn how to do
it in school is you say, oh,

00:07:44.490 --> 00:07:47.815
well, 2 is less than 8,
so let me borrow the 1.

00:07:47.815 --> 00:07:48.930
It becomes 12.

00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:50.890
This becomes a 0.

00:07:50.890 --> 00:07:56.120
0 is less than 3, so let
me borrow 1 from this 5.

00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:57.140
Make this 4.

00:07:57.140 --> 00:07:58.710
This becomes 10.

00:07:58.710 --> 00:08:01.270
So then you say
12 minus 8 is 4.

00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:05.780
10 minus 3 is 7 and
you bring down the 4.

00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:09.400
Hopefully what I've done here
will give you an intuition

00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:10.510
of why borrowing works.

00:08:10.510 --> 00:08:12.760
And this is something that
actually I didn't quite

00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:16.690
understand until a while after
I learned how to borrow.

00:08:16.690 --> 00:08:19.650
And if you learned this, you'll
realize that what you're doing

00:08:19.650 --> 00:08:21.260
here isn't really magic.

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:23.780
And hopefully, you'll never
forget what you're actually

00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:25.400
doing and you can always
kind of think about what's

00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:28.900
fundamentally happening to
the numbers when you borrow.

00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:31.580
I hope you found that useful.

00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:32.400
Talk to later.

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:33.700
Bye.
