00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:04.790
You dream every night, you might be yelling
that you don’t, but you’re wrong.

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:07.560
Just because you don’t remember it doesn't
mean you didn’t dream.

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:08.560
Everyone dreams.

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:11.690
Even animals!

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:17.000
Hey lovers and dreamers, Lissette here for
DNews.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.109
When your head hits the pillow at night and
you fall into a deep slumber, you dream.

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:25.609
And we're not alone, according to new, and...
well old research, animals are dreamers too.

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:30.429
Of course, there is no way to ask an animal
once they wake up if they were dreaming, but

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:33.570
science points to yes, most animals dream.

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.350
And it all comes back to Rapid Eye Movement,
or REM.

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:37.370
We sleep in stages.

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:41.410
REM sleep is the final stage in your sleep
cycle and when dreaming occurs.

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:45.681
Like a lot of things in the brain, it is still
a mystery, but scientists think REM sleep

00:00:45.681 --> 00:00:48.690
has to do with storing memories and learning.

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.610
When REM sleep starts, your body sends signals
to your cerebral cortex, where learning, organizing,

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.300
and thinking occur.

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:59.469
Signals are also sent to your spinal cord,
where neurons are shut off - this causes temporary

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:02.820
paralysis of your limb muscles so you don't
act out your dreams.

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.070
Meanwhile, random signals are also send to
your cortex and some scientists think this

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:08.780
is where dreams come from.

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.549
They think dreams are your brain trying to
make sense of those random signals, creating

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:14.320
something like a story.

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:19.070
So basically, if scientists observe REM sleep
in animals, they can conclude that those animals

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:20.070
are dreaming.

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.920
Or to put it in a more sciency way, Patrick
McNamara, director of Evolutionary Neurobehavior

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:29.970
Laboratory at Boston University says, “it
is reasonable to suppose that animals have

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.189
something like what we call dreams.”

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:36.360
Until recently REM sleep cycles were only
seen in mammals and some birds, but researchers

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.630
in Germany might have discovered that reptiles
dream too.

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:44.479
Researchers put probes inside the brains of
five bearded dragons to measure electrophysical

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:45.690
activity while they slept.

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:49.230
And they found that they had sleep stages
similar to that of REMming humans.

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:50.770
So, dreams!

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:53.149
Or again, something like what we call dreams.

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:57.520
The lizards averaged 350 REM cycles lasting
about 80 seconds each.

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:03.060
To put that in context, humans can experience
5 REM cycles a night of more than an hour

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.060
each!

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.170
But REM sleep isn’t the only way we’ve
been able to tell animals dream.

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:12.500
Scientists can watch animals sleep and see
how they move -- just like your family pooch.

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.520
But, remember how the brain paralyzes us so
we don't act out our dreams?

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:21.810
Well, in 1959 a French neuroscientist altered
the part of a cat’s brain that is responsible

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:22.810
for this.

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.930
So, when the cat fell asleep, it moved all
sorts of ways.

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.950
Scientists observed it raising its head, arching
its back and overall appearing as if it were

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:31.629
stalking or hunting prey.

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:32.629
Dream prey! -- awesome band name.

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:34.950
And scientists have even studied what animals
dream about.

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.090
Research done at MIT looked at rats' brain
patterns when they were in REM sleep…

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.400
And found they were similar to brain patterns
measured when they were running through a

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:44.400
maze when awake.

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.330
They figured the rats were dreaming about
their daily maze running.

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:52.620
The two measurements were so aligned scientists
could conclude where the rats were in the

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:53.620
dream maze.

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:57.739
A study was also done on zebra finches that
found they might be practising their songs

00:02:57.739 --> 00:02:58.840
while they sleep.

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.200
But what does all this mean?

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:04.690
Well, it helps us understand our brain a little
bit more, but also a little bit more about

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:05.690
evolution.

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:09.909
If a similar sleep pattern is occurring in
the brains of mammals, birds and lizards,

00:03:09.909 --> 00:03:14.190
that means it likely existed in our common
ancestor: the amniote.

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:19.099
Which existed about 320 million years ago,
suggesting sleep patterns may have evolved

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:22.290
100 million years earlier than we previously
thought.

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.130
Do you dream about crazy things?

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:26.909
Maybe you should start an online dream journal
through a website.

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:28.630
Domain.com can help you do that!

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:32.980

But, even with all that.

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:42.020
Sleep is still pretty crazy.

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:46.459
Over on DNews plus Trace looked at lucid dreaming,
dream monitors, and even if we could someday

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:48.659
record what you're dreaming about!

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:08.330
Running any mazes?

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:09.330
Stalking prey?
