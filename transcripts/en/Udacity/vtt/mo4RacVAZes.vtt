00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
[D. Evans] So before we go on to the next major computer science topic

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
we're going to introduce, I want to give you one more quiz

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
to see if you can write a Python expression

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
that's going to give you some idea how fast a computer executes.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
So your goal for this quiz is to write some Python code

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
that will print out how far light travels in 1 nanosecond.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Let me give you some information that will help with this.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:32.000
The speed of light is 299,792,458 meters per second, so almost 300 million.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
One meter is 100cm.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:43.000
One nanosecond is 1 billionth of a second, which is 1 divided by 1000000000.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
So your goal is to compute how far light travels in 1 nanosecond

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
and to get that answer in centimeters.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
I don't want this to be an algebra quiz,

00:00:52.000 --> 99:59:59.000
so all you need to do is multiply these 3 values together and you'll get the answer we want.
