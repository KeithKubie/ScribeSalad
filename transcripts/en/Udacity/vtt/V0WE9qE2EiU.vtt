00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I chose to solve this problem by relying on our knowledge of conservation of energy,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
one of the big topics we talked about in this unit.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Conservation of energy says that the kinetic energy plus the potential energy

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
at all points in this problem should be the same.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
For this original point to look at, I'm going to choose the point where the block is over here

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
with an original velocity of 2 m/s, so it definitely has a non-zero kinetic energy.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
And what about the potential energy?

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Well, there's always some gravitational potential energy,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
but that's not going to change in this problem because the block is only traveling horizontally.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
We can safely ignore that for this problem.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
The only potential energy we're concerned about is the potential energy of the spring.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
And since currently the spring is completely uncompressed, it's at its equilibrium length,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
we can say that the potential energy in the spring is 0, so we can cross out this term.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
For my final point, I'm going to choose this point here

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
where the block speed is 0, and the spring is quite compressed.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Now, why do we know this happens.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Well, the block comes in with a velocity pointing to the left of 2 m/s,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
and we know it's going to push against the spring and go back with a rightward velocity of 2 m/s.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
So, somewhere along the line, the changing between a leftward velocity of 2 m/s

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
and going to a rightward velocity of 2 m/s, the velocity must have been 0.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
That's actually the point where the spring is the most compressed

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
during the entire course of this spring-block interaction.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
That's a good point to look at in our equation.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
At this point, since the velocity of the block is 0, it has no kinetic energy.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
We know that the final kinetic energy here is 0. All right, we're making progress.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:35.000
I can replace the kinetic energy with 1/2 mv² and the potential energy with 1/2 kΔx²

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
like we saw on the previous video and plug in those values and we get that the maximum displacement

00:01:40.000 --> 99:59:59.000
away from the equilibrium length is 0.141 m. Great Work.
