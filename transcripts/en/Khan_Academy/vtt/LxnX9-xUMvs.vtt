00:00:00.305 --> 00:00:01.705
- [Voiceover] Now that
we've read the passage

00:00:01.705 --> 00:00:03.683
let's see if we can answer the questions.

00:00:03.683 --> 00:00:05.002
In the context of the passage,

00:00:05.002 --> 00:00:08.262
the author's use of the
phrase her light step flying

00:00:08.262 --> 00:00:12.542
to keep time with his long
stride, lines four to five,

00:00:12.542 --> 00:00:15.983
is primarily meant to
convey the idea that?

00:00:15.983 --> 00:00:18.922
So, that's right over
here, lines four to five.

00:00:18.922 --> 00:00:20.982
So, her light step,

00:00:20.982 --> 00:00:23.361
her light step flying to keep time

00:00:23.361 --> 00:00:24.441
with his long stride.

00:00:24.441 --> 00:00:25.841
So, remember, this is,

00:00:25.841 --> 00:00:28.321
Mattie Silver had lived under
Ethan's roof for a year,

00:00:28.321 --> 00:00:31.122
and from early morning
till they met at supper

00:00:31.122 --> 00:00:32.642
he had frequent chances of seeing her,

00:00:32.642 --> 00:00:35.718
but no moments in her company
were comparable to those when.

00:00:35.718 --> 00:00:37.816
So, he's talking about a really good time

00:00:37.816 --> 00:00:39.519
when her arm in his,

00:00:39.519 --> 00:00:41.571
and her light step flying to keep

00:00:41.571 --> 00:00:43.613
time with his long stride.

00:00:43.613 --> 00:00:46.872
They walked back through
the night to the farm.

00:00:46.872 --> 00:00:48.192
So, you kind of imagine,

00:00:48.192 --> 00:00:52.089
he's this guy and he's,
these long strides,

00:00:52.089 --> 00:00:55.747
and he's not used to being
kind of connected to people

00:00:55.747 --> 00:00:56.888
and being happy around people,

00:00:56.888 --> 00:00:58.509
but then there's her and her light step

00:00:58.509 --> 00:01:00.149
flying to keep time with his.

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.510
So, you imagine this
person and they're kind

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:04.169
of having this enthusiastic
and spirited conversations.

00:01:04.169 --> 00:01:06.189
I mean, we read the whole
passage about nature,

00:01:06.189 --> 00:01:09.289
and about science, and about
feeling this connection.

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:12.929
So, yeah, this first
choice Ethan and Mattie

00:01:12.929 --> 00:01:14.967
share a powerful enthusiasm.

00:01:14.967 --> 00:01:17.188
That looks like what's being described.

00:01:17.188 --> 00:01:19.188
I mean, in fact as we read on we realize

00:01:19.188 --> 00:01:23.157
that's at least what Ethan at
the time thought was going on.

00:01:23.157 --> 00:01:25.584
B, Mattie strives to match the speed

00:01:25.584 --> 00:01:28.122
at which Ethan works.

00:01:28.122 --> 00:01:29.444
Well, no, that would be the case if, like,

00:01:29.444 --> 00:01:31.318
they were saying that
he has these long stride

00:01:31.318 --> 00:01:32.318
and she was having trouble,

00:01:32.318 --> 00:01:33.958
and the whole passage was about her having

00:01:33.958 --> 00:01:35.639
trouble doing all the work in the house

00:01:35.639 --> 00:01:37.919
that she wants him to do and all of that.

00:01:37.919 --> 00:01:38.620
But that's not what it's about.

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:40.976
The whole passage is about
this powerful enthusiasm

00:01:40.976 --> 00:01:44.278
and it really starts
from these early lines

00:01:44.278 --> 00:01:46.099
where we're talking about this is the time

00:01:46.099 --> 00:01:48.118
that he liked being around
her and this connection

00:01:48.118 --> 00:01:51.078
and her light steps flying to keep

00:01:51.078 --> 00:01:52.760
time with his long stride.

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:54.679
You kinda, they've having fun,

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:57.660
the spirited, passionate
conversations in the night.

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:00.939
Mattie and Ethan playfully
compete with each other.

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:03.158
Compete, well, no, the
spirit of competition

00:02:03.158 --> 00:02:03.999
doesn't really play out here.

00:02:03.999 --> 00:02:05.358
In fact, most of what
he kind of talks about,

00:02:05.358 --> 00:02:08.918
he likes being like this
teacher, professorial figure,

00:02:08.918 --> 00:02:11.859
this father figure kind of that likes

00:02:11.859 --> 00:02:14.728
to awaken her appreciation of the planet.

00:02:14.728 --> 00:02:16.288
So, it doesn't really
seem like a competitive

00:02:16.288 --> 00:02:18.786
or even a playfully
competitive relationship.

00:02:18.786 --> 00:02:20.607
It's really, she, he's the teacher.

00:02:20.607 --> 00:02:21.688
At least, he thinks he's the teacher

00:02:21.688 --> 00:02:25.325
and she's the student who's
appreciating him and nature.

00:02:25.325 --> 00:02:28.365
Ethan walks at a pace
that frustrates Mattie.

00:02:28.365 --> 00:02:29.928
Well, nothing in the passage makes us

00:02:29.928 --> 00:02:31.716
think that, or at least in the beginning,

00:02:31.716 --> 00:02:33.941
that Mattie somehow got
frustrated by Ethan.

00:02:33.941 --> 00:02:37.451
It sounds like, at least
over in those times,

00:02:37.451 --> 00:02:40.861
when he's reminiscing
about it that he believes

00:02:40.861 --> 00:02:43.132
that she was really enjoying all of this.

00:02:43.132 --> 00:02:45.033
So, I would definitely go with A.

00:02:45.033 --> 00:02:46.931
Let's go to the next question.

00:02:46.931 --> 00:02:48.876
The description in the first paragraph

00:02:48.876 --> 00:02:50.892
indicates that what Ethan values

00:02:50.892 --> 00:02:53.029
most about Mattie is her...

00:02:53.029 --> 00:02:55.229
Fitness for farm labor.

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:57.492
No, he, in fact, he says right over here,

00:02:57.492 --> 00:02:59.393
"She don't look much on housework."

00:02:59.393 --> 00:03:00.912
So, it's not gonna be that.

00:03:00.912 --> 00:03:03.263
Vivacious youth.

00:03:03.263 --> 00:03:04.392
That's possible.

00:03:04.392 --> 00:03:08.532
I mean, she is this
kind of youthful spirit

00:03:08.532 --> 00:03:10.392
that's entered into this life.

00:03:10.392 --> 00:03:13.633
Receptive nature, freedom from worry.

00:03:13.633 --> 00:03:15.534
So, the receptive nature
is interesting too

00:03:15.534 --> 00:03:17.174
because he talks in
the whole passage about

00:03:17.174 --> 00:03:19.393
how open she is about learning

00:03:19.393 --> 00:03:21.934
about the stars and about geology

00:03:21.934 --> 00:03:22.734
and whatever else.

00:03:22.734 --> 00:03:23.833
Well, let's just see.

00:03:23.833 --> 00:03:25.331
"But she don't look much on housework

00:03:25.331 --> 00:03:27.552
"but she ain't a fretter, anyhow."

00:03:27.552 --> 00:03:29.392
But then they say, "But it was not only

00:03:29.392 --> 00:03:31.213
"that the coming to his house of a bit

00:03:31.213 --> 00:03:33.294
"of hopeful young life was like

00:03:33.294 --> 00:03:36.174
"the lighting of a fire on a cold breath."

00:03:36.174 --> 00:03:37.928
So, he's saying it was't only

00:03:37.928 --> 00:03:39.966
essentially her vivacious youth.

00:03:39.966 --> 00:03:41.783
"The girl was more than the bright

00:03:41.783 --> 00:03:44.041
"serviceable creature he had thought her.

00:03:44.041 --> 00:03:47.820
"She had an eye to see and an ear to hear.

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:49.922
"He could show her things
and tell her things,

00:03:49.922 --> 00:03:52.183
"and taste the bliss of feeling

00:03:52.183 --> 00:03:55.602
"that all he imparted
left long reverberations,

00:03:55.602 --> 00:03:59.442
"reverberations and echoes
he could wake at will."

00:03:59.442 --> 00:04:01.401
So, this is, it starts off saying,

00:04:01.401 --> 00:04:05.041
look, it didn't look
like she was necessarily

00:04:05.041 --> 00:04:09.322
the most impressive to look
at from a labor point of view

00:04:09.322 --> 00:04:12.561
and sure, she had vivacious
youth but that wasn't it.

00:04:12.561 --> 00:04:13.921
The really powerful thing about her

00:04:13.921 --> 00:04:17.219
is she had an eye to
see and an ear to hear.

00:04:17.219 --> 00:04:19.340
He could show her things,
and tell her things,

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:21.540
and taste the bliss of feeling that all

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:24.001
he imparted left long reverberations

00:04:24.001 --> 00:04:26.042
and echoes he could wake at will.

00:04:26.042 --> 00:04:28.681
So, really, it is about
the receptive nature.

00:04:28.681 --> 00:04:30.139
She was open to these things

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:31.840
and he wanted to teach her, and she was,

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:34.943
at least he thought,
excited about these things.

00:04:34.943 --> 00:04:37.583
Question four, which choice provides

00:04:37.583 --> 00:04:40.903
the best evidence for the
answer to the previous question?

00:04:40.903 --> 00:04:44.383
Well, actually I would, I
would, I would, let's see.

00:04:44.383 --> 00:04:45.943
I think I highlighted them.

00:04:45.943 --> 00:04:47.685
She had, she had,

00:04:47.685 --> 00:04:49.103
the girl was more than the bright

00:04:49.103 --> 00:04:51.325
serviceable creature he had thought her.

00:04:51.325 --> 00:04:54.722
She had an eye to see and ear to hear.

00:04:54.722 --> 00:04:57.202
He could show her things
and tell her things.

00:04:57.202 --> 00:04:58.104
So, let's see.

00:04:58.104 --> 00:04:58.904
Which of these are that?

00:04:58.904 --> 00:05:02.704
This is, like, line 15 through 16, 17, 18.

00:05:02.704 --> 00:05:04.664
That's, actually, I highlighted,

00:05:04.664 --> 00:05:07.184
happened to highlight those exact lines.

00:05:07.184 --> 00:05:08.482
I like to these, as you can tell,

00:05:08.482 --> 00:05:10.523
in real time so that I am experiencing

00:05:10.523 --> 00:05:11.981
it as you would experience it.

00:05:11.981 --> 00:05:13.221
But luckily, I literally,

00:05:13.221 --> 00:05:14.842
well, anyway, you get the point.

00:05:14.842 --> 00:05:16.202
This is the line that tells,

00:05:16.202 --> 00:05:18.082
these are the lines that
say that she was receptive.

00:05:18.082 --> 00:05:20.002
She had an eye to see and an ear to hear.

00:05:20.002 --> 00:05:22.083
He could show her things
and tell her things.

00:05:22.083 --> 00:05:24.781
So, definitely go with that.

00:05:24.781 --> 00:05:27.863
The author includes the
descriptions of the sunset,

00:05:27.863 --> 00:05:30.585
the clouds, and the hemlock shadows.

00:05:30.585 --> 00:05:31.944
Hemlock is a type of plant.

00:05:31.944 --> 00:05:34.103
So, the shadows of the
plants says we're in nature.

00:05:34.103 --> 00:05:35.882
So, lines 41, 43.

00:05:35.882 --> 00:05:37.482
So, let's go down to line 41.

00:05:37.482 --> 00:05:41.543
Line 41, 43, and I'll start
reading a little early.

00:05:41.543 --> 00:05:43.282
And there were other sensations.

00:05:43.282 --> 00:05:47.744
Less definable but more
exquisite. More exquisite.

00:05:47.744 --> 00:05:50.623
So, before we was talking about
kind of science of the stars

00:05:50.623 --> 00:05:53.121
and being able to think about

00:05:53.121 --> 00:05:55.522
what's in the fossil
record and all of that,

00:05:55.522 --> 00:05:56.438
but then they were saying there were

00:05:56.438 --> 00:06:00.217
other sensations less
definable but more exquisite,

00:06:00.217 --> 00:06:04.318
which drew them together
with the shock of silent joy.

00:06:04.318 --> 00:06:07.795
The cold red of sunset
behind the winter hills,

00:06:07.795 --> 00:06:12.039
the flight of cloud-flocks
over slopes of golden stubble,

00:06:12.039 --> 00:06:16.879
or the intensely blue shadows
of hemlock on sunlit snow.

00:06:16.879 --> 00:06:18.478
When she said to him once,

00:06:18.478 --> 00:06:20.178
"It looks just as if it was painted."

00:06:20.178 --> 00:06:22.966
So, this is just kind of that incredible,

00:06:22.976 --> 00:06:24.872
I mean, I feel that maybe I should have

00:06:24.872 --> 00:06:27.891
hung out with Ethan Frome (laughs)

00:06:27.891 --> 00:06:29.651
but when you're in nature there's this

00:06:29.651 --> 00:06:32.309
indescribable feeling of how
it just connects with you.

00:06:32.309 --> 00:06:33.873
The beauty of it all.

00:06:33.873 --> 00:06:35.732
So, this is what they're
describing over here

00:06:35.732 --> 00:06:36.971
when we're talking about the sunset,

00:06:36.971 --> 00:06:39.451
the clouds, the hemlock shadows.

00:06:39.451 --> 00:06:42.091
So, it suggests the peacefulness
of the natural world.

00:06:42.091 --> 00:06:43.391
Oh yeah.

00:06:43.391 --> 00:06:46.533
Emphiase the acuteness of
two characters' sensations.

00:06:46.533 --> 00:06:48.613
Yeah, I like that because he's talking

00:06:48.613 --> 00:06:50.551
about him in the past as we read it

00:06:50.551 --> 00:06:53.031
that he was wondering
is he the only person

00:06:53.031 --> 00:06:55.070
who feels so strongly about nature

00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:57.470
and the beauty of the natural world

00:06:57.470 --> 00:06:59.732
but he's, at the time he said,

00:06:59.732 --> 00:07:01.845
"I think I found someone in this Mattie,

00:07:01.845 --> 00:07:04.720
"who connects with this sensation,

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:06.481
"who understands it."

00:07:06.481 --> 00:07:09.070
Foreshadowing the decline of
the fortunes of two characters.

00:07:09.082 --> 00:07:10.290
No, this isn't that.

00:07:10.290 --> 00:07:12.072
This is about their connection.

00:07:12.072 --> 00:07:14.690
Offer a sense of how fleeting time can be.

00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:16.592
No, this was about both of them,

00:07:16.592 --> 00:07:19.724
him feeling this very basic

00:07:19.724 --> 00:07:21.394
passion for everything around him,

00:07:21.394 --> 00:07:23.234
this almost indescribable thing,

00:07:23.234 --> 00:07:24.692
and her connecting with it.

00:07:24.692 --> 00:07:26.779
And when she says, "It looks
just as if it was painted."

00:07:26.779 --> 00:07:29.578
He feels that she had
just perfectly described

00:07:29.578 --> 00:07:31.999
what he was feeling these sensations.

00:07:31.999 --> 00:07:36.086
So, I definitely, I
definitely would go with B.
