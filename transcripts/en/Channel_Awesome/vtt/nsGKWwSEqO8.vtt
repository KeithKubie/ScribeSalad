00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.960
"Why, that black-and-white cartoon from God-knows-when?"

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.940
"How could a film based on that thing be as horrible as I'm making it out to be?"

NC: And in case you're wondering,

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.980
no, there's no other 3D animation in the entire picture.

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:57.040
So really, this is completely pointless.

It's like watching that annoying Mario head at the opening of Mario 64.

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:04.380

ALL THE PROBLEMS WITH THE MOVIE in the first two minutes!

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.940
Yeah!

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:55.060
Actually, everything wrong with this film you can sum up in literally the first two minutes!

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:58.120
Firstly: the animation is obnoxious. It needs Ritalin.

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.240
Second: It has the same problem as The Magic Voyage:

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:06.540
It's just constant noise all throughout the film. It never takes a break!

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:11.720
Pearl: The Duke of Zill! He's gotten through the impasse with a whole army!

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:12.980

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:18.880
Why?

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:24.420
Because the sound mixing is so bad, that half the time, you can't even make out what they're saying!

Give The Magic Voyage some credit; I at least heard every piece of shit dialogue that was written!

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:38.700
Third: the lip movements almost never match what the characters are saying.

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.500
Look at this scene: the guy never closes his mouth!

But hey!

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:53.780
Seeing how we can't HEAR what the characters are saying half the time anyway, I guess it doesn't matter.

It's two minutes. TWO MINUTES, and already I want to stab a puppy and eat people!

Pray for the apocalypse people! We have 80 more minutes of this shit!

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:05.820
Okay, so what I could gather over the underwater audio is that the princess' uncle...

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:20.360
there is now no defense against such a possibility.

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:37.420

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:41.020
(as Oriana): And even if someone DID try to break in,

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:44.120
I would just hold my dress on both sides and think happy thoughts.
