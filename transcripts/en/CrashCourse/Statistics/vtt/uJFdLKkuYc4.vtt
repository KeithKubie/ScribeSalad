00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:06.299
Hi, I’m Adriene Hill, and Welcome back to
Crash Course Statistics.

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:11.009
In the last episode we talked about some areas
in which we still struggle to make consistently

00:00:11.009 --> 00:00:12.769
accurate predictions.

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:15.549
But there are also many areas in which we
have done really well.

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:19.500
Companies have increasingly improved their
use of both customer and outside data to make

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.590
sure they have the right items in stock.

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:25.339
And our ability to predict the weather has
improved a ton since the days when people

00:00:25.339 --> 00:00:28.609
believed that deities used weather to punish
us.

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:33.120
Statistics has also transformed sports from
football fans who use state of the art analytics

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.520
to come up on top of their fantasy football
leagues, to soccer where players shooting

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:43.059
penalty kicks have figured out where to aim
the ball for the highest chance of scoring.

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:46.220
Baseball even has a name for its analytic
field: Sabermetrics.

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:49.570
Pretty much everything we’ve done in this
series from data visualization, to chi-square

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:55.660
tests, to Machine Learning and bayesian hypothesis
testing has led up to this last episode.

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:59.329
Whether we’re doing inferential tests, or
creating predictive models, we want to make

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:00.680
informed decisions.

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.360
From which medication to take, to which colleges
to apply to.

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:10.000
And statistics allows us to use inference
and prediction to make those decisions.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:18.360
INTRO

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.990
Let’s start with how prediction helps companies
and their customers.

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.250
Walmart, has accumulated data on customer
demand for different items.

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.310
And their team discovered some surprising
trends, like the fact that wind conditions

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:34.700
may have an impact on whether or not customers
want to eat berries…

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.220
They found that people like to eat berries
when temperatures it’s cooler than 80F or

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:42.720
26.7 C and there’s very little wind.

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.230
So, they advertise berries more at times like
that, when demand is high.

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:52.270
They also know that if it’s not raining
and warm people are likely to buy steaks.

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:58.710
If it gets hot--over 90F or 32.2 C people
buy hamburger.

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.220
Big and small stores alike all want to predict
exactly when people will want to buy things.

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.410
If they can get it right, then they save money
by not having unwanted merchandise taking

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:09.250
up warehouse space, and make money by selling
stuff.

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:14.420
They also won’t LOSE money because they
didn’t have enough stock of a popular item.

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.540
And customers are happy if there are NY strip
steaks available when they want to eat them.

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.920
One company that has shared a bit about its
algorithms is StitchFix.

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:27.250
It’s a style subscription service that sends
you clothes to try on and potentially buy.

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:31.370
StitchFix uses data and statistics in order
to make sure that they choose clothes you’re

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.049
more likely to wanna keep.

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:34.719
And their model has a lot of moving parts.

00:02:34.719 --> 00:02:40.099
It uses algorithms not just to stock its warehouse
or match me with a blouse but also to help

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:42.040
DESIGN clothes.

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.420
Each dress or pair of pants has a set or attributes.

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.480
Gold, Lame, Flared.

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.129
Stitchfix also has data on what subscribers
like.

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:51.140
Gold, Lame.

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:57.780
To create new styles the recombine the attributes
of existing styles and alter them slightly.

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.980
Then they bring the human designers to help
out.

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:00.980
At least for now..

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:05.989
Alright, gold lame pants probably aren’t
the best example of successful use of statistics

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:10.299
and algorithms, but the success of statistics
and analytics in baseball will not come as

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:13.760
a surprise to anyone who has seen or read
“Moneyball”.

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.780
Stats like batting average--which is number
of hits divided by number of times at bat--have

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:19.510
been around for a long time.

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:23.590
But many of these simpler stats were missing
a lot of information about what really makes

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:25.719
a good baseball player.

00:03:25.719 --> 00:03:31.069
In Moneyball, Michael Lewis writes about Bill
James the father of sabermetrics who believed

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:35.090
“The statistics were not merely inadequate;
they lied.

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:39.239
And the lies they told led the people who
ran major league baseball teams to misjudge

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:42.340
their players, and mismanage their games.“

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:46.709
So in 2001, when the Oakland A’s lost 3
of their best players, and found themselves

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:51.489
with a lack of funds to replace them, manager
Billy Beane decided to use statistics to find

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:53.260
the best players for the team.

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:57.379
Beane and his assistant--the stats savvy Paul
DePodesta--looked at how adding individual

00:03:57.379 --> 00:04:01.159
players to the team could increase the probability
of winning games.

00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:05.840
They calculated more complicated statistics
such as how many walks players had, and their

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:10.280
on base average (which is a measure of how
often a player reaches a base whether from

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:12.730
a hit, a walk, or by being hit by the pitch).

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:15.700
They used data that other teams weren’t
paying attention to, and as a result, they

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:18.250
recruited players that other teams had overlooked.

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:21.610
Beane’s attention to statistical details
paid off.

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:26.480
In the 2002 season, the A’s won 20 straight
games, a record at the time for their league.

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:31.120
This spurred on the popularity of Sabermetrics
which is the statistical analysis of players

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:33.400
and gameplay in baseball.

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:37.750
Sabermetricians use statistics to figure out
who to hire, who to trade, and when to pull

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:39.210
pitchers from the mound.

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:44.540
Major League Baseball teams use high-def cameras
and radar to measure pitch release and velocity.

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:46.480
They track a baseball’s spin rate.

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:50.440
They gather data on the angle of the the ball
when it leaves the bat after it’s been hit.

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:55.680
And data shows that a ball hit a little higher
is more likely to become a hit or homerun.

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:59.340
So, baseball players are now trying to hit
the ball higher in the air.

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:05.140
According to the Washington Post--the average
launch angle went up from 10.5 degrees in

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:08.490
2015 to 11.5 degrees in 2016.

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:10.650
Or as Dodger Justin Turner, put it:

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:12.780
“You can’t slug by hitting balls on the
ground.

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:16.900
You have to get the ball in the air if you
want to slug, and guys who slug stick around,

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:18.230
and guys who don’t, don’t.”

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:21.630
Managers sometimes use statistics when they’re
deciding when and where players should stand

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:22.630
on defense.

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:28.070
Kind of like when I was at bat as a kid, and
everyone ran in 5 steps it was embarrassing.

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:29.070
Whatever.

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:33.050
Since managers have access to data on every
player, -they can gauge where a ball hit by

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:35.660
an opposing batter is most likely to go.

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:40.630
Traditionally the baseball players stand about
here But managers can move them, based on

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:42.100
the past behavior of the batter.

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:46.220
If a player has a tendency to hit the ball
to the left side of the field--like data from

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:52.020
the Cubs’ third baseman Kris Bryant showed
in 2017 and 2018--managers can move their

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:55.550
fielders so that they’re more concentrated
in that area.

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:58.900
This gives the team on defense a better chance
of getting the out.

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:03.470
And it turns out defenses shift against Bryant
specifically over half the time he’s at

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:04.470
bat!

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:05.470
A lot of teams do this.

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:07.870
Defensive shifting has gone up 5% in the last
year.

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:11.740
The Houston Astros and the Kansas City Royals
shift more than most.

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:16.090
The Astros shifted their defense about 37%
of the time in 2018.

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:21.900
And the Royals shifted 27% of the time, which
meant they shifted 1304 more times than they

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:23.390
did in 2017.

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:27.510
Sabermatrecians aren’t the only ones predicting
what’s going to happen on the field.

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:29.310
Meteorologists are using statistics to predict
the weather.

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:31.650
so they can have that big tarp ready when
it rains.

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:34.790
I love that big tarp. [tarp-spreading noise]

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:38.030
Weather has historically seemed unpredictable
to humans.

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:42.880
In ancient Greek mythology, Zeus controlled
the sky, as well as the thunder, rain, and

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:43.880
lightning.

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:44.880
But we’ve come a long way since then.

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:49.330
In 1870, President Ulysses S. Grant established
The Weather Bureau--now called the National

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:51.420
Weather Service--in the United States.

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:55.390
At first, forecasts were filled with vague
uncertainty, and had very little precision

00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:58.050
compared to the hour by hour forecasts we
have today.

00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:02.720
They were also limited in their reach, perhaps
only forecasting a day or two compared to

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:04.660
today’s 10 day forecasts.

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:07.580
Over the years, our predictive abilities have
improved.

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:12.060
According to Nate Silver, “In 1972, the
[National Weather Service’s] high-temperature

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:16.580
forecast missed by an average of six degrees
when made three days in advance.

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:18.550
Now it’s down to three degrees.”

00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:23.169
Silver also cites the current odds of an American
being killed by lightning -- 1 in 11 million

00:07:23.169 --> 00:07:27.780
-- compared to those odds in 1940, 1 in 400,000.

00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:32.860
Some of that not-being-struck-by-lightning
can be attributed to better weather prediction.

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:37.720
U.S. meteorologists and weather researchers
use a combination of doppler radar, satellites

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:42.380
data around the planet and facing the sun,
radiosondes in weather balloons in the upper

00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:44.750
stratosphere, and regular old weather stations.

00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:49.460
And then they crunch all that data with NOAA’s
Weather and Climate Operational Supercomputer

00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:54.400
System which is 6 million times faster than
your or my computer.

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:58.280
And that allows them to more accurately predict
weather events, like rainfall, drought and

00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:01.740
hurricane paths
About 25 years ago, hurricane path predictions

00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:06.540
would be off by about 563 km (350 miles).

00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:12.780
Now we’re off only about 161 km (100 miles)
and scientists likely will keep improving

00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:13.780
on that.

00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:16.920
Nate Silver notes in his book “The Signal
and the Noise” that the advanced notice

00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:22.120
we had that Hurricane Katrina was going to
hit New Orleans likely saved a lot of people.

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:26.090
Even though Katrina was still devastating,
a few decades ago, we may not have known to

00:08:26.090 --> 00:08:28.370
evacuate as many people as we did.

00:08:28.370 --> 00:08:31.710
With better weather prediction--we also have
more time to get out of the way of tornadoes

00:08:31.710 --> 00:08:34.399
and flash floods and severe thunderstorms.

00:08:34.399 --> 00:08:38.490
We can avoid getting stuck in extreme heat
or extreme cold.

00:08:38.490 --> 00:08:39.959
And stay off icy roads.

00:08:39.959 --> 00:08:43.520
It’s important that we have continued improvement
on a global scale.

00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:47.660
Being able to predict rainfall and get that
data to the right people will be crucial,

00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:50.680
particularly as temperatures change and the
climate shifts.

00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:55.199
In recent years, climate scientists have been
able to more accurately forecast rainfall

00:08:55.199 --> 00:09:00.209
in sub-Saharan Africa, which impacts food
from farms that use rain as a water source.

00:09:00.209 --> 00:09:04.519
But for weather predictions to be useful to
as many people as possible, experts recommend

00:09:04.519 --> 00:09:09.290
that investments are made in data management
systems, satellites, and means to distribute

00:09:09.290 --> 00:09:12.420
the information to the right people, like
rural farmers.

00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:15.920
The complexity of the weather data can also
make it hard to create a “best” model

00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:17.089
by hand.

00:09:17.089 --> 00:09:21.480
Some researchers have begun to use Machine
Learning to help handle all that data.

00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:27.290
One team at Chapman University used a Recurrent
Neural Network to predict droughts in California.

00:09:27.290 --> 00:09:30.889
They predicted how severe droughts would be
and their model did pretty well

00:09:30.889 --> 00:09:32.829
Weather is an incredibly noisy phenomenon.

00:09:32.829 --> 00:09:37.600
There are many factors that affect the temperature,
humidity, and other weather events.

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:42.939
And the more complex a phenomenon is, the
more data we need to accurately predict it.

00:09:42.939 --> 00:09:47.300
As we’ve discussed before, Neural Networks
are often better than humans at figuring out

00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:50.420
patterns in huge amounts of complex data.

00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:54.279
Statistics help us see how the world works,
and hints at how the world could work.

00:09:54.279 --> 00:09:57.959
It helps us see through uncertainty, but doesn’t
get rid of that uncertainty.

00:09:57.959 --> 00:10:02.259
It can show us our biases, it can also paper
over them.

00:10:02.259 --> 00:10:05.360
Statistics help us update our beliefs and
come up with new ones.

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:09.120
Even if you don’t come away from this series
remembering what ANOVA stands for we hope

00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:13.709
you take away that the world isn’t binary
that it’s complicated sometimes requiring

00:10:13.709 --> 00:10:15.360
complicated solutions.

00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:19.980
If you don’t remember specifics about p-values
take away the importance of reading further

00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:24.200
anytime you see a study that you might base
a life decision on see if it makes sense to

00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:25.200
you.

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:27.199
And remember improbable things are likely
to happen.

00:10:27.199 --> 00:10:29.180
Just not to you. Or to me.

00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:33.279
Most of us are right in the middle of most
of the curves that describe us.

00:10:33.279 --> 00:10:34.860
And that’s OK.
