00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.050
And think back to what we
were talking about earlier.

00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:05.520
A vertical line like this has
every single x value the same.

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.852
Every point has an x value equal to 4.

00:00:07.852 --> 00:00:09.779
1, 2, 3, 4.

00:00:09.779 --> 00:00:11.980
So that's the equation of this line.

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:17.110
Maybe you can tell me for this line
what you think the equation might be.

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:20.710
And note that all of the points
in this line have a y value of 2.

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:22.210
Think about it, and

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:26.010
when you have an answer that you like,
try entering it in this box.

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:26.811
Don't worry if it's not right.

00:00:26.811 --> 00:00:28.039
