00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:01.130
Guys, c'mere…

00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:05.120
I have a secret…
the military has a secret space shuttle!

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:11.710
oh, everyone already knew that.

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:20.140
So in case you didn't already know, the U.S.
Air Force has a SECRET SPACE SHUTTLE!

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:23.779
If you pay attention to space news, you probably
already heard about it.

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:28.060
I mean, Vandenberg Air Force Base sent out
a press release last week telling the world

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:31.269
it was landing last Tuesday!

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:37.580
It's called the X-37B, and the secret part
isn't that it exists, but what it's FOR.

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:42.601
Here's what we DO know: The reusable orbiter
is a fourth the size of the old NASA space

00:00:42.601 --> 00:00:46.040
shuttle -- which means it's only 9 and-a-half
feet tall (2.9M) and not quite 30 feet long

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:47.040
(8.9M).

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:48.280
It's unmanned, and fully automated.

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:53.710
It's launched atop an Atlas V rocket and can
stay in space for a LONG time, using solar

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:58.900
panels to power itself, and when one landed
in 2010 it did so autonomously.

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:04.719
NASA started the X37 project in 1999 and transferred
it to the Defence Advanced Research Projects

00:01:04.719 --> 00:01:07.810
Agency -better known as DARPA - in 2004.

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:14.200
Her first flight was in 2006, and there have
since been three orbital flights and two tiny

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.310
orbiters built…

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:19.340
The third mission ended this week, more than
doubling the time in space of the previous

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:20.340
mission.

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.810
The Air Force is open with all this information,
but when asked what the X-37B is DOING up

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.459
there… that's when things get all Area 51-ish.

00:01:29.459 --> 00:01:35.569
They're quote "testing technologies," "operating
experiments," and trying to create a quote

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:39.469
"fast-turnaround vehicle -- making sure it
can be re-fueled and re-launched within days"

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:41.030
rather than months.

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:46.900
But the theories as to what it's doing up
there abound!

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:54.319
According to amateur astronomers it flies
around 218 miles up (350km), above the ISS,

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:57.869
and an ideal altitude for spying -- says some
sources.

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:03.819
Popular Mechanics did a short round-up, and
they say the three major theories are these:

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:09.210
it's either a spy plane -- spying from space
is ideal, the media has worried about it,

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:15.500
and those astronomers say the orbit should
fly over Afghanistan, Iran and Pakistan.

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.210
Hmm… perhaps it's a space-based bomber!

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:22.090
The payload bay is small, but no so much that
the X-37B couldn't hold a nuke!

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:23.090
(Of course, NASA studied this in the 60s,
and found nuclear blasts in space, or high

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:24.090
orbit can mess with a LARGE section of Earth.

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:25.090
Why risk taking a nuke to space?!

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:26.090
It could screw up communications globally,
and irradiate a lot of the surface.

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:27.090
Based on actual nuclear tests in space, NASA
discovered radiation exposure between 8 and

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:28.090
17 times higher than at sea level with the
same explosive.

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:29.090
That's horrifying.

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:30.090
Plus the amount of fuel required to move a
spacecraft around in space makes a space-bomber

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:31.090
of that size fairly useless.

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:32.090
) THIS SEEMS TO TAKE THE SCRIPT A BIT OFF
THE RAILS - COULD CUT.

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:33.090
Maybe…

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:34.090
*GASP* the government is telling the truth,
and it's for experiments!

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:35.090
The Air Force is known for trying cutting
edge tech, so maybe?

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:36.090
I dunno.

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:37.830
Regardless, the X-37B's third mission came
to an end this week, bringing all this to

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:38.830
the surface again.

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:43.160
Neither Boeing nor the Air Force are saying
anything about the exact mission, but Boeing

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:50.111
is already contracted to create the X-37C,
which is 65-percent larger -- meaning it could

00:02:50.111 --> 00:02:54.630
carry up to six astronauts.

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:56.670
What do you think these secret shuttles are
for?

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:03.340
Are they going to fly to the far side of the
moon and look for aliens?

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:20.380
WHAT DOES IT DOOOOO??
