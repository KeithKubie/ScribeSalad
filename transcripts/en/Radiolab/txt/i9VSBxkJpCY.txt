Speaker 1:          00:00          Hello. I'm Jad Abumrad and I'm Robert Krulwich dishes radiolab. This hour we're going to talking about diagnosis, diagnosis, the easy kind. We're not going to talk about it. Easy would be you come into my office and I'm a doctor. You have a broken arm. I take a picture. I say, Hey, you've got a broken arm. That picture says so. Yeah, cause you can see the break right there. But let's suppose you came into my office and you were sad. You tell me that your sex drive is down. Yay. I'm the doctor. So we're going to sit. But just between you and me, right? Well, right away my learning tells me that you may be a candidate for depression, but how do I know that you're depressed? What do you mean? How do we know we talk about it? You just said, well you can't measure sadness or depression.

Speaker 1:          00:41          You can't go to a test tube and count anything. Right. It's not hard science. Yeah, because till now, what if I put you in, you know, one of those FMR I machines that we've talked about so often? I snap a picture of your brain in action and I look at it and from your picture I say that you are depressed. You're going to tell me I'm depressed. Just from looking at a picture of my brain. Yes. What? No Way. Look, it's now here. Photographic diagnosis of mental illness. This is happening. There is no question and that by the way, is Eric Candela professor up at Columbia University who just happens to have won the Nobel prize for medicine. Let me give you a little historical back. Did you get a note, Bill? I don't think you did. I still don't believe you. And what just cause he's got a Nobel prize.

Speaker 1:          01:31          I'm going to suddenly turn it. Oh no you're not. So let's do this step by step. Okay. Step one. Imagine you're slipping into an FMR I machine. Okay. I want you to just look at my face. Why is that so difficult? Just to know what this is going anywhere. Okay. I'm looking at your face now that you're looking at my face. Different regions of the brain, they become active. There are cells in your brain that are saying, I know him. The cells are more active. They need energy. Just like when you're running, you have to breathe fast and to get the energy, your heart pumps more blood. The body sends a rush of fresh blood with that particular group of cells because the blood has iron in it. The magnet and the brain scanner can see the iron and therefore see the blood field and take pictures of it.

Speaker 1:          02:22          Many, many pictures in real time. I'll show you a very nice example of that. Eric's now heading off across his ample office with an extraordinary view of the Hudson Valley and he brought over a picture of a human brain with different colors in different areas and he told me, when you look at a face, when you image the face, this area lights up. You're pointing to an area of your main area of the brain, your on your forehead kind of. That's right. That's fine. If you look at a house, some other area lights up, but this area does not light up. You look at another face. This area lights up again. Every time you see a face, the same area. Yup. But you haven't told me anything about emotions yet. That's true. So let's move on to step two because we use faces to tell what someone else's thinking or someone else's feeling.

Speaker 1:          03:08          Looking at faces also triggers an area deep in the brain that is concerned with the emotion called the Amygdala. Now very recently a number of people have looked at the make the looking at faces and it's extremely interesting. Step three. Okay, I'm going to take you now to London. Hello. Hi. Yeah, hi. Yeah, that's good. It's okay. Who is this? Oh wait, sorry. Who are you? I'm Cynthia [inaudible]. My psychiatrist at the Institute of Psychiatry Kings College London. And Are you liking your 30s or your forties or your 50s this is part of the interview I want cause like cause your mood tonight man. I wanted to establish that she came into psychiatry. Trying to think, when did I graduate medical school. I didn't live very critical time. I finished my training in 97 my training in psychiatry in 97 1997 when the Fmri machines were first becoming available. And so Cynthia was able to do a rather amazing study.

Speaker 1:          04:03          What in this study she got together a group of people who were clinically depressed, depressed people, and then another group of people who are normal, healthy people and she put them in the brain scan machine and showed them facial expressions, faces ranging from more neutral expressions to more sad expressions. So they saw a sad face and then a neutral face and a sad face. That's right. And what the person in the machine was supposed to do is look at these faces and decide whether it was a man or a woman's face. Huh? What does that have to do with anything? Because, because while they were doing that, now they're making this decision. The emotion of the face is being processed automatically. The amygdala sees the emotion on the faces at that moment and the machines, it's like tick, tick, tick, tick, tick. And they were hundreds of pictures.

Speaker 1:          04:50          10th of a second to 10th of a second. A 10th of a second. That's right. Did you see a difference between the people who were depressed and the people who were normal? Yes. Was it a significant difference or adjust? Barely difference as a group it was a significant difference and now she takes the big step. Step four from the pattern she sees in bunches of people, she feeds all those patterns into a computer called machine learning. Show the program. This is a pattern of brain activity and depressed people. This is a pattern and brain activity in healthy people. And then she shows the computer a brain scan of a new person. So this is someone the computer's never met before. Exactly. And she did this a bunch of time, right? A whole bunch of people. And each time the computer tries to get, is this new person depressed or not? Oh and what? What happened? More than 85% of the time, 86% of the time the algorithm correctly diagnosed, whether that person was depressed or healthy.

Speaker 2:          05:52          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          05:53          was just a brain scan, a computer and a patient. No doctor. Cynthia's computer got the diagnosis right. 86% of the time a computer. Let me saw the results. It's like, wow, this is amazing. Wait a second. Has she repeated this? Well, this is actually the very first time that this has been done with depression and so it's just a pilot study and like you say, someone else will have to do it again and again and again, but according [inaudible] does, Cynthia, the potential is fantastic. Psychiatry is going to be absolutely revolutionize. I think this method can be applied to any psychiatric disorder, any autism. It's a phrenia obsessive compulsive disorder. No Way. Come on. Why not? Every one of these illnesses ultimately must have an anatomical basis, every one of these illnesses, so this means that it will shoot or one day be possible for a patient to come in and you take a picture of him in real time or of her and you will have a diagnostic tool.

Speaker 1:          06:53          That's what you're saying? Absolutely. Absolutely. You mean to tell me that they're going to put people in machines and just go boom, no, no, no. Wait, wait, wait. This is not a casual thing. You go to the doctor, you tell the doctor that you're feeling a certain way, the doctor will talk to you and then he would come to you and say, well my learning and the test tells me that you're ill. So that's all it's happening. Share is now the medical doctor was habitats. We have nothing in this that feels invasive to you. Well obviously huddling into the deep depths of your personhood is no, this is, if you believe that mental illness is a mental illness, it is a structural condition which can be fixed. So it's not the deep inner you, it's the broken you. So it's like the broken arms and you started off with that.

Speaker 1:          07:43          So you would put the two side by side. I think I would. And then of course you get to the Nelson. Come on Robert. I mean human beings are way too messy for that. You're too messy for it to be that easy. No, no way. So you think this is out of science's reach? Really? It's just too, there's a part of me that does think it is out of science. I think it's because you think you think that they're looking deep inside you. That's what you don't like. I do. I mean, don't get me wrong. I find brain scans fascinating when it comes to questions like where is the salt? What is consciousness? That kind of stuff, but don't kind of get in my head and tell me what's what's right and what's wrong and sick. Don't you want to get better? Yes, but I enjoy the comfortable ambiguity that would come from a situation like sitting in a therapist's office and saying, well, I'm, how am I feeling?

Speaker 1:          08:26          I'm feeling this way or that way. And in the messiness of trying to just rely on how you're feeling, there's a vast landscape of, of things that can happen. Choices. You can make therapies, you can pursue it this way. Let's say you are sick and you know that you're sick machine or no. Okay. [inaudible] if you are feeling badly, wouldn't it be nice if a machine could help you find the right kind of help? What do you mean? Well, Eric took me people to do a thought experiment, a mind experiment. You've developed a psychotherapy and I've developed a psychotherapy. We each claim it's the best in the world. Now we have an objective way of seeing this machine allows you to independently of any evaluation, see the outcome of treatment. So you can audit the doctor, audit the doctor and give you evidence that it's working or no.

Speaker 1:          09:13          Okay. [inaudible] a little bit on board. I can give you 10% buy in now. Okay, so how far off is this stuff? Is it going to come soon? This is very early in the game, obviously, but I get to ask him like how far into the future are we talking about here? Soon or mid after long after you're dead. I'm going to be around a long time, but the question stands, will you make it to see that said, look, people who actually have you don't. One can't in medicine. In all honesty, give a timeline for many of these things. Imaging methodology right now is quite sophisticated, but it's still primitive compared where it needs to be. You're picking this up in status and this entity, you become excited as the thing is beginning to emerge. We see it for the first time on the horizon. You saying we got to the story too early. That's what you said, just right. It's not going to be interesting. 20 years from now it'll be obvious. Or in 20 years it'll be obvious that we were wrong. Okay. That's a real possibility because what we don't know is ally's vast. Yeah, and I want to tell you a story now about just how wrong people can be. Okay. It begins with a mystery, sudden infant death syndrome, perfectly healthy child goes to sleep and dies during the night.

Speaker 2:          10:34          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          10:34          it's about the worst thing that can happen to a parent and each year it does happen about 7,000 times. It's still, no one knows why. Oh, and by the way, that was Robert Sapolsky. He's a professor of neuroscience at Stanford University, and a Spolsky tells this story of the moment sids was diagnosed for the first time, or at least classified in a terrible mistake that was made around 1900 or so. People were being made to recognize this as a disease entity and nobody knew what was up. So people decided, let's go dissect sids. Kids meaning when a baby would die, they would perform an autopsy. Exactly, yes. Checked the baby's inside. See if there's anything different in them from normal kids. That seems logical. Absolutely. They measure the size of the baby's lungs. Yep. Normal. And they didn't. They measured the size of the heart. Yep. Nothing strange. Their stomach, kidney, liver, Yep. Those are all fine. Then they would look in the throat.

Speaker 2:          11:31          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          11:31          they look in there and they say, oh my God, these sids kids, they have enormous fine. This glance, the thymus of famous. What is the famous wonder? Well, it is a little tiny pink gland that is right there. Right behind your collarbone, Huh? At the base of your throat. And Its job is to help you fight disease makes one type of cell critical to your immune system, especially in times of stress. Any case, normally this little organ is about the size of a tiny tube of toothpaste, like the tribal coin. But in these six kids it was huge. Humongous, enormous. Twice the size. Exactly. And since the thymus is dangerously close to the windpipe, doctors came up with a hypothesis, perfectly reasonable hypothesis, which was that maybe if you're one of these babies with an enlarged thymus and you're asleep and somehow you roll over wrong [inaudible] well that gland might press down on your trachea and suffocate you during the night.

Speaker 1:          12:32          Oh, so medical mystery soft, really? Nope. They even came up with a name for it. It was called status find Maco, lymphatic and the spillage. It was in all the pediatric textbooks by the 1920s and you would look in there and there'd be pictures, there would be pictures of the dissector fine misses, normal size. And here on the right in large, abnormally large status find the colon fat. And in no time at all, doctors came up with a treatment, perfectly logical therapy, which is that if we're going to help these babies, we've got to shrink their thymus gland. And to do that, the best solution obviously is to irradiate their throats or radiate their throats to shrink their thymus gland

Speaker 3:          13:25          that the child's throat with trillions of radioactive particles.

Speaker 1:          13:30          You literally, you Betcha. And this was considered like something every good loving parents should do. Absolutely. If you worry about your child being at risk for sids, go and get their throats irradiated to shrink the thymus glands and did it work? Yes. Shrank the following. Ms Glanz. But he says it did have another effect. Decades later. You've killed 20 to 30,000 people with thyroid cancer. 20 30,000 deaths. That's a, that's a real number. Yeah, that's a, that's a fairly big one. Yeah. So here's my question. How could these doctors have gotten it so, so, so, so, so wrong. Do you know what I mean? I do. I don't. You know what you mean? You just answered your own question a minute ago. No, no, I didn't. I'm about to answer it right now. They're playing with radiation. You just said that. But what they, what? They didn't know that radiation would hurt you. They had no, it was like, that's not technology, but that's not what I was

Speaker 4:          14:29          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          14:31          no, a couple of decades into radiation having been discussed,

Speaker 4:          14:34          isotopes are performing near miracles of diagnosis and discovery.

Speaker 1:          14:39          Well, we're just tossing around radiation all over the place. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          14:42          Iodine one 31 radioactive sodium right off gamma rays. Blue Trot.

Speaker 1:          14:46          And this was a period with madame Curie dipping her arm into vats of radioactivity. Harmless in dying. Soon afterwards from cancer, people would go into shoe stores and they would have their feet x-ray. Yes. X-Ray is a wonderful invention I had that you had that. I did. Yes. Kick off your shoes. And I think you can look at your balloon. That's exactly what that, how would you do that? That's what that was back. That was the thing you could do at the shoe store was very cool. Good. Showing how cutting edge of a shoe store or they aren't.

Speaker 1:          15:19          So that's your explanation. Yeah. So that may look like the explanation, meet your radiation would play a role. But if you would have, let me say what I was gonna say. I would have told you the real explanation. Yes. Preceded the radiation by like a couple hundred years. Hello? I don't know, idea what you're talking. I'm going to tell you back in the 17 hundreds okay. Oh, that far back, that far back before, uh, radiation before, uh, your grandpa for, uh, before the civil war or the Eiffel tower in Napoleon. I'm talking when the red coats were still wearing red. Yeah. Yeah. This was shortly after the revolutionary war, right about this time. So supposedly the first med schools exist, started to pop up in America, and a supply and demand issue came into effect because with these med schools came med students, medical students who needed to learn about anatomy.

Speaker 1:          16:06          And of course, in order to do that, they needed bodies, you know, to dissect this, produced this whole occupation. You could be a resurrection list or resurrect Janice. Yup. And they would go out and dig up bodies that's at night and sell them to the unanimous just the medical schools. I'll need two more by Thursday. [inaudible] yeah. Hey Dick. Now here's the key point. Since demand was so high, the resurrection has had to go where the bodies were easiest to get, which meant no, avoiding the fancy graveyards. If you were wealthy, you could have yourself buried in what was called a patent coffin, which was a triple layer coffin, which was meant to be. Resurrection is proof, but if you are not wealthy, no fancy coffin for you, you'd probably just be buried in a sack and some poppers field just a few inches under the soil. Very accessible for these resurrection lists. Not surprisingly, that's where they went. Are we still on the same topic? Are you explaining why children die? Yes, yes, they're with me. All right. What I'm trying to make is that the grave robbers targeted the poor so much so sometimes when they, you know, people would catch these resurrection lists in the act and see like, oh my God, that's my dad. You're digging up [inaudible] there'd be riots.

Speaker 1:          17:38          Stop stealing leaps recalled out and why odors were shot. Are we talking like hundreds of people torch bearing a, it was townies versus the people who are trying to dissect their dead relatives. This is a lot of history and I'm very fascinated in quotes. What does this have to do with kids dying? Fire, right? Let me bring it home. Not that it hasn't been interesting, but being at home, okay. As a result of all of this hubbub over a grave robbing country after country throughout Europe decided, no, let's standardize how science gets it's cadavers. Forget all this great robbing. So they passed laws which formalized anyone who died in a poorhouse, uh, their body would be turned over to the anatomist. This was like the cadaver version of direct deposit. Okay. So grave robbing was gone, but now all the body's use by medicine and not just some, but nearly all now came from the poor estimates were by the end of that century, 99% of the body's used for, for anatomy lessons had been derived from poor houses.

Speaker 1:          18:40          And that seemed okay until 1936 a guy named Han Soviet showed that being poor actually warps your body. And now Robert, now we come back to the case of the mysteriously enlarged time is cause if you're poor, you're either worried about your job, you're worried about feeding your family, you're worried about the bills. In other words, you are stressed out during chronic stress. Your immune system goes down the tubes and since the time is this part of the immune system, if you are chronically stressed, the thymus gland shrinks. Hello, I'm Jad Abumrad and I'm Robert Krulwich Radiolab. This hour we're going to talking about diagnosis, diagnosis. The easy card, we're not going to talk about it easy would be you come into my office and I'm a doctor. You have a broken arm. I take a picture. I say, Hey, you've got a broken arm. That picture says so.

Speaker 1:          19:32          Yeah, cause you can see the break right there. But let's suppose you came into my office and you were sad. You tell me that your sex drive is down. Yay. I'm the doctor. So we're going to sit. But just between you and me. Well, right away my learning tells me that you may be a candidate for depression, but how do I know that you're depressed? What do you mean? How do we know we talk about it? You just said, well you can't measure sadness or depression. You can't go to a test tube and count anything. Right? It's not hard science. Yeah. Because till now, what if I put you in, you know, one of those FMR AI machines that we've talked about so often? Yeah. I snap a picture of your brain in action and I look at it and from your picture I say that you are depressed. You're going to tell me I'm depressed. Just from looking at a picture of my brain. Yes. What? No Way. Look, it's now here. Photographic diagnosis of mental illness. This is happening. There is no question, and that, by the way, is Eric Kandel, a professor up at Columbia University who just happens to have won the Nobel prize for medicine. Let me give you a little historical backwards. Did you get a note.
