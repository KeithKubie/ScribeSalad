Throughout this unit, we've learned how to graph linear equations and linear

00:00:03.977 --> 00:00:08.172
inequalities. We're going to wrap this unit up by talking about functions. All

00:00:08.172 --> 00:00:12.330
the linear equations that we've encountered are actually functions and we're

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.024
going to learn why. Functions take some sort of input like Bob, they do

00:00:16.024 --> 00:00:20.500
something mysterious to it, and then get an output like o. This mysterious part

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:24.690
is the part we're trying to figure out. It's the description or rule that

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:28.995
changes Bob into o. Here is the list of the names of some people. These are

00:00:28.995 --> 00:00:32.977
going to be my input and here is a list of outputs. I'm going to pair each

00:00:32.977 --> 00:00:37.751
person with an output by showing some errors. Bob goes to the letter o, Jill

00:00:37.751 --> 00:00:42.581
goes to the letter i, and Ralph goes to the letter a, and so on. So in this

00:00:42.581 --> 00:00:48.457
relation, what's the relationship between these inputs and these outputs? Finish

00:00:48.457 --> 00:00:51.360
out this sentence using the best choice.
