00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:04.100
Let's review a little bit of
what we know about exponents.

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:10.660
So if I were to have 3 to
the second power times 3

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:17.130
to the third power,
what does that equal?

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.390
Well, we could expand
it out just as a review.

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:22.705
3 to the second power-- well,
that's going to be 3 times 3.

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:27.040
And then 3 to the
third power-- we're

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:29.870
going to multiply it by
3 to the third power--

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:34.910
is going to be 3
times 3 times 3.

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:36.720
So what is this
going to be equal to?

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:41.520
Well, this is going to be equal
to 3 to the 2 plus 3 power.

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.600
And this comes straight
out of what an exponent is.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.130
We're taking two 3's and
multiplying it together.

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:56.510
And then we're going to
multiply that with three 3's

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:57.890
being multiplied together.

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.150
So you're going to end up
with 2 plus 3, or five,

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:02.890
3's being multiplied together.

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:07.490
So this, of course, is
going to be equal to 3

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:08.285
to the fifth power.

00:01:12.474 --> 00:01:13.890
And that's a little
bit of review.

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.290
And this is one of the
core exponent properties.

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:21.750
If you have the same base
multiplied to exponents,

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.630
and you're taking the product
of those two expressions,

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.610
you can essentially, or you
do, just add the exponents.

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:30.780
3 to some exponent times
3 to some other exponent

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.047
is going to be 3 to the
sum of those two exponents.

00:01:35.047 --> 00:01:36.630
So that's kind of
interesting, but now

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.630
let's use this property
right over here

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.430
to try to think about what a
negative exponent should be.

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:50.480
So we're going to try to think
about what should-- let's just

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:56.122
say 3 to the negative 2 power--
what should this be equal to?

00:01:56.122 --> 00:01:58.580
And I encourage you to pause
this video and think about it.

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:01.030
Think about, what should
this be equal to if we

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:03.140
want this property
to hold, that if you

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.759
have the same base raised
to different exponents,

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:09.050
and you're taking the product
of those two expressions,

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:13.820
that you can take that base to
the sum of those two exponents.

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:16.840
Well, let's try a
little experiment here.

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:28.220
What should 3 squared times
3 to the negative 2 power be?

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.590
What should this be equal to?

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:33.280
Well, if we want to keep
this property going,

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:40.280
this should be equal
to 3 to the 2 plus

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:48.220
negative 2 power, which, of
course, would be equal to 3

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:49.725
to the 0-th power.

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.180
And any non-zero number
to the 0-th power

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:57.910
is going to be equal to 1.

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:00.660
So this should be equal to 1.

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.540
So we should define 3 to
the negative 2 in some way

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.080
so that 3 squared times
3 to the negative 2

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:07.890
should be equal to 1.

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:12.740
We need to do that if we want
this property to hold right

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:13.670
over there.

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:15.840
So let's just think about
what 3 to the negative 2

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:16.910
should actually be.

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:19.530
So we want this to equal 1.

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:23.745
Let me copy and paste that
so that we can manipulate it

00:03:23.745 --> 00:03:24.870
a little bit algebraically.

00:03:29.651 --> 00:03:30.150
All right.

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:31.320
So we have that on one side.

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:36.080
We want that to be equal to 1.

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:38.250
And let me clean
this up a little bit.

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.480
We want that to be equal to 1.

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.260
So to define 3 to
the negative 2,

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.640
or to think about what 3 to
the negative 2 should be,

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:49.300
let's divide both
sides by 3 squared.

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:51.675
Let's divide both sides by that.

00:03:51.675 --> 00:03:54.160
So let me copy that.

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.460
So we're going to divide
this side by that,

00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:00.260
and we're going to
divide this side by that.

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.617
And let me draw a line so that
you know that we're dividing.

00:04:03.617 --> 00:04:05.200
So we're going to
divide the left hand

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:08.130
by that and the
right hand by that.

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:11.190
Well, 3 squared over 3
squared-- those cancel out.

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:13.540
And now we get a really
interesting result.

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:20.060
We get that 3 to
the negative 2 power

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:27.540
should be equal to 1 over
3 to the second power.

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:34.960
And I really want you to
internalize this right over

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:35.110
here.

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:37.040
You have something to
the negative power,

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:39.230
to the negative 2
power, in this case.

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:44.110
That's equal to 1 over 3
to the positive version

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:45.930
of that exponent.

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:47.630
And this is true in general.

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:50.650
In the next video, we'll
use a very similar argument

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:55.650
to prove this for any non-zero
base and any exponent,

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:58.060
that raising it to
the negative should

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:00.209
be-- if you want this
exponent property to hold,

00:05:00.209 --> 00:05:02.000
that you would add the
exponents when we're

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.750
taking the product of
the same base raised

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:05.040
to different exponents.

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:06.680
If you want that
property to hold,

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:09.000
when you raise something
to the negative exponent,

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.460
it should be 1 over
that base raised

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:14.570
to the positive version
of that exponent.

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:17.250
So 3 to the negative
2 power is 1 over 3

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:20.700
squared, which is equal to 1/9.
