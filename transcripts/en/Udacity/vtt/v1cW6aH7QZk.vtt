00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:05.270
I'm sure you have noticed that this class has a subtitle, cognitive systems.

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:09.430
Let's talk about this term and break it down into its components. Cognitive,

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:13.850
in this context, means dealing with human-like intelligence. The ultimate goal

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:18.650
is to dwell up human level, human-like intelligence. Systems, in this context,

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:23.310
means having multiple interacting components, such as learning, reasoning and

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.615
memory. Cognitive systems, they are systems that exhibit human level,

00:00:28.615 --> 00:00:33.110
human-like intelligence through interaction among components like learning,

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:38.150
reasoning and memory. Thus, on a spectrum, what we'll discuss in this

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:41.960
class will definitely lie on the right side of the spectrum, on the human side.

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.470
We will be talking about thinking and acting, but

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:47.050
we will always be concerned with human cognition.
