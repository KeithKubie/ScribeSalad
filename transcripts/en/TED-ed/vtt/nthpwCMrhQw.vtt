00:00:06.919 --> 00:00:32.500
(Music)

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.612
Aw, thank you, thank you.

00:00:35.612 --> 00:00:37.490
As you can probably tell,

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:39.047
I'm an astronaut.

00:00:39.047 --> 00:00:42.825
No, I'm a DJ/Producer, as it says on the screen.

00:00:42.825 --> 00:00:44.699
I am also a high school student,

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:45.970
just like many of you guys.

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:47.420
How many high school students do we have out here?

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:48.536
(Cheers)

00:00:48.536 --> 00:00:50.129
Oh, okay! A good amount.

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.740
I'm a proud member of my school's marching band,

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:53.297
and I run track, as well,

00:00:53.297 --> 00:00:55.210
so if any of you guys are into that,

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:57.084
it's one of my other passions.

00:00:57.084 --> 00:00:58.661
I have been DJing and producing

00:00:58.661 --> 00:01:00.574
for a little over three years now,

00:01:00.574 --> 00:01:02.435
and I've worked with artists that you may know,

00:01:02.435 --> 00:01:05.407
like Avicii, Skrillex, Major Lazer,

00:01:05.407 --> 00:01:08.824
Krewella, Porter Robinsion, Carnage, and many others.

00:01:08.824 --> 00:01:12.003
How many of you guys like dance music?

00:01:12.003 --> 00:01:14.493
Show off hands, dance music, oh okay.

00:01:14.493 --> 00:01:16.874
How many of you guys like rap or trap hip hop?

00:01:16.874 --> 00:01:18.812
Okay, good amount.

00:01:18.812 --> 00:01:21.364
Jazz? Classical?

00:01:21.364 --> 00:01:23.084
That's good, you guys have smart minds, that's good.

00:01:23.084 --> 00:01:24.505
What's great about DJing

00:01:24.505 --> 00:01:27.125
is that you can combine all these genres into one idea,

00:01:27.125 --> 00:01:29.118
and what I like to do is combine

00:01:29.118 --> 00:01:33.973
dance, hip hop, trap, dubstep, even movie samples,

00:01:33.973 --> 00:01:36.362
and kind of combine them into one set.

00:01:36.362 --> 00:01:38.326
DJing creates this, sort of, combined culture

00:01:38.326 --> 00:01:40.092
that really unites many fans.

00:01:40.092 --> 00:01:41.548
A good example of this

00:01:41.548 --> 00:01:43.907
is Skrillex and A$AP Rocky's collaboration

00:01:43.907 --> 00:01:45.422
"Wild for the Night"

00:01:45.422 --> 00:01:48.691
or, most recently, Avicii and Ella Black's "Wake Me Up."

00:01:48.691 --> 00:01:50.670
How many of you guys know that song?

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.419
It's a great track.

00:01:52.419 --> 00:01:54.853
Now, what exactly does a DJ do?

00:01:54.853 --> 00:01:56.822
Well, as you just saw earlier,

00:01:56.822 --> 00:01:58.738
they mix tracks.

00:01:58.738 --> 00:02:00.154
What I just did

00:02:00.154 --> 00:02:02.536
was mix a Kanye West intro from "Black Skinheads"

00:02:02.536 --> 00:02:04.164
with a track called "LRAD."

00:02:04.164 --> 00:02:05.917
One of the main goals is to really

00:02:05.917 --> 00:02:07.745
trigger samples, tracks, or clips

00:02:07.745 --> 00:02:09.583
and kind of create this long journey.

00:02:09.583 --> 00:02:11.692
I'm going to do another little example for you guys right now

00:02:11.692 --> 00:02:13.627
of what DJs call a "mashup,"

00:02:13.627 --> 00:02:15.245
which is taking two or more tracks

00:02:15.245 --> 00:02:17.042
and combining them into one.

00:02:17.042 --> 00:02:18.515
This mashup was made famous

00:02:18.515 --> 00:02:21.403
by a Hungarian duo Myon &amp; Shane 54,

00:02:21.403 --> 00:02:24.389
and it takes the vocals from Krewella's "Alive."

00:02:24.389 --> 00:02:26.544
How many of you guys know that song? "Alive"?

00:02:26.544 --> 00:02:28.386
Yeah, okay.

00:02:28.386 --> 00:02:30.252
I'm going to take the vocals from that track

00:02:30.252 --> 00:02:32.240
and the song "Language" by Porter Robinson.

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:36.229
So, let me just play you the vocals first.

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:43.943
(Music)

00:02:43.943 --> 00:02:45.323
So, that's the vocals,

00:02:45.323 --> 00:02:47.414
and here's the actual track.

00:02:47.414 --> 00:02:50.032
(Music)

00:02:50.032 --> 00:02:51.617
So, what I'm going to do is I'm going to fill these vocals

00:02:51.617 --> 00:02:52.786
on top of the track

00:02:52.786 --> 00:02:54.826
and create a new song, a kind of combined song,

00:02:54.826 --> 00:02:56.717
with the two vocals.

00:02:56.717 --> 00:03:10.196
(Music)

00:03:10.196 --> 00:03:11.425
If you turn it down,

00:03:11.425 --> 00:03:14.356
you can just hear I'm playing it a capella

00:03:14.356 --> 00:03:15.934
or just the song by itself.

00:03:15.934 --> 00:03:26.944
(Music)

00:03:26.944 --> 00:03:28.598
Now, what I'm going to do after this drops

00:03:28.598 --> 00:03:30.159
is change it into another song.

00:03:30.159 --> 00:03:31.909
One of the most important things about dance music

00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:33.701
is really the drop,

00:03:33.701 --> 00:03:35.740
so I'm going to change it into another song

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:37.788
and really catch you by surprise.

00:03:37.788 --> 00:04:05.227
(Music)

00:04:05.227 --> 00:04:07.470
And that's one example right there.

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:09.559
(Applause)

00:04:09.559 --> 00:04:13.994
So, as you saw, I took three different songs

00:04:13.994 --> 00:04:15.993
and kind of combined them into one new idea,

00:04:15.993 --> 00:04:18.721
which is something plenty of DJs do out there

00:04:18.721 --> 00:04:20.217
on the professional circuit.

00:04:20.217 --> 00:04:22.009
There are plenty of ways to get started DJing.

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:23.732
One of the main things I did

00:04:23.732 --> 00:04:26.455
was really take the time to study DJs that inspired me.

00:04:26.455 --> 00:04:28.431
Whether it was watching podcasts,

00:04:28.431 --> 00:04:30.454
watching live sets,

00:04:30.454 --> 00:04:32.062
or just really looking them up online.

00:04:32.062 --> 00:04:33.625
I really tried to take in what it meant

00:04:33.625 --> 00:04:35.216
to be a fantastic DJ.

00:04:35.216 --> 00:04:36.679
One of the best ways to really learn

00:04:36.679 --> 00:04:39.652
is to ask a friend, you know, a friend who knows how to DJ.

00:04:39.652 --> 00:04:42.153
Just go over there, ask him a few questions.

00:04:42.153 --> 00:04:45.990
If no that, thankfully we have a lot of great online resources.

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:47.902
One of the things you can do is check out YouTube,

00:04:47.902 --> 00:04:51.210
check out some demonstrations.

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:53.247
Now, many DJs, a high percentage of them,

00:04:53.247 --> 00:04:56.825
check out Beatport or Soundcloud to find a lot of the tracks.

00:04:56.825 --> 00:04:58.593
There are also many other blog sites,

00:04:58.593 --> 00:05:02.531
such as Billboard's CODE, EDMTunes, EDM Sauce,

00:05:02.531 --> 00:05:04.170
or Dancing Astronaut.

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:05.751
Now, there are multiple ways to DJ,

00:05:05.751 --> 00:05:09.573
and what could originally only be done on turntables and vinyl,

00:05:09.573 --> 00:05:10.851
by legends

00:05:10.851 --> 00:05:14.017
such as Larry Levan, Grandmaster Flash, and Paul Oakenfold,

00:05:14.017 --> 00:05:17.639
can now be done with many more pieces of equipment,

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:19.126
such as CDJs,

00:05:19.126 --> 00:05:21.119
which are, sort of, digital turntables

00:05:21.119 --> 00:05:24.062
and what I learned on and what I still use to this day.

00:05:24.062 --> 00:05:26.899
There are many other amazing programs now,

00:05:26.899 --> 00:05:29.158
such as Ableton, Traktor Pro,

00:05:29.158 --> 00:05:32.655
Serato, or even apps for tablets and touchscreens.

00:05:32.655 --> 00:05:35.619
There are many hardware systems

00:05:35.619 --> 00:05:37.619
just like my APC40 here

00:05:37.619 --> 00:05:41.132
that can launch samples, clips and tracks.

00:05:41.132 --> 00:05:43.905
You can also just use turntables, CDJs,

00:05:43.905 --> 00:05:46.169
an S4 controller, or an Novation Launchpad.

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:49.886
And all of these really kind of do the same thing,

00:05:49.886 --> 00:05:52.125
and that's mix tracks.

00:05:52.125 --> 00:05:53.466
So, what I'm going to do now

00:05:53.466 --> 00:05:57.107
is show you guys another mix demonstration.

00:05:57.107 --> 00:05:58.541
I'm going to start with one of my own songs

00:05:58.541 --> 00:06:00.206
that I did with my friend Matt Dzyacky,

00:06:00.206 --> 00:06:01.874
and from there I'm going to go

00:06:01.874 --> 00:06:03.128
in a sort of medley of different tracks

00:06:03.128 --> 00:06:10.473
and show you the different styles of mixing that you can do.

00:06:10.473 --> 00:06:18.301
(Music)

00:06:18.301 --> 00:06:21.183
So I'll show you guys when I start mixing the new track,

00:06:21.183 --> 00:06:22.993
so you can hear it coming in.

00:06:22.993 --> 00:06:32.413
(Music)

00:06:32.413 --> 00:06:34.174
You can hear in the back, a new song is mixing in.

00:06:34.174 --> 00:06:43.257
(Music)

00:06:43.257 --> 00:06:45.924
Now, another thing that DJs use is what's called a mixer,

00:06:45.924 --> 00:06:47.783
and a mixer has many different effects,

00:06:47.783 --> 00:06:54.220
such as a beat roll,

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:56.684
filter effects,

00:06:56.684 --> 00:06:58.441
and any other different ones.

00:06:58.441 --> 00:07:00.124
There's plenty of effects to use.

00:07:00.124 --> 00:07:15.673
(Music)

00:07:15.673 --> 00:07:17.260
So, now I'm going into a new song,

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:18.649
and after this drops,

00:07:18.649 --> 00:07:19.962
I'm going to drop it in another song

00:07:19.962 --> 00:07:21.316
and kind of change it up.

00:07:21.316 --> 00:07:42.992
(Music)

00:07:42.992 --> 00:07:45.161
And that's a new song bite.

00:07:45.161 --> 00:08:01.257
(Music)

00:08:01.257 --> 00:08:02.747
So I'm just going to straight mash up

00:08:02.747 --> 00:08:05.016
another song right when this one breaks down.

00:08:05.016 --> 00:08:13.357
(Music)

00:08:13.357 --> 00:08:15.081
Now, if I want to change up the music,

00:08:15.081 --> 00:08:16.647
let's say, throw in some new beats,

00:08:16.647 --> 00:08:19.641
I can just choose a trap beat I want to throw over the breakdown.

00:08:19.641 --> 00:08:29.044
(Music)

00:08:29.044 --> 00:08:32.874
So, I get ready to throw in my new beats now.

00:08:32.874 --> 00:09:43.440
(Music)

00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:45.353
And that is the end of that demo.

00:09:45.353 --> 00:09:50.077
(Applause)

00:09:50.077 --> 00:09:52.193
Thank you, thank you!

00:09:52.193 --> 00:09:54.263
Now, the great thing about technologies now

00:09:54.263 --> 00:09:56.102
is whether it's a two dollar app

00:09:56.102 --> 00:09:58.258
or a couple hundred dollar equipment,

00:09:58.258 --> 00:09:59.721
which I'm sure most parents

00:09:59.721 --> 00:10:01.288
won't want to buy for their child,

00:10:01.288 --> 00:10:03.636
is that almost anyone who has a passion for DJing

00:10:03.636 --> 00:10:05.361
and a passion for the music

00:10:05.361 --> 00:10:07.141
and who might want to pursue a career in it

00:10:07.141 --> 00:10:09.599
really has the ability to, well, pursue it,

00:10:09.599 --> 00:10:11.618
such as myself.

00:10:11.618 --> 00:10:13.809
You can start with an app on a tablet

00:10:13.809 --> 00:10:15.471
or an app on your phone, even, an app on your iPad,

00:10:15.471 --> 00:10:17.635
and then move on to bigger equipment.

00:10:17.635 --> 00:10:19.625
The opportunities are endless,

00:10:19.625 --> 00:10:21.417
and, as you saw, you can mix

00:10:21.417 --> 00:10:22.849
many different styles of music.

00:10:22.849 --> 00:10:24.682
So, thank you!
