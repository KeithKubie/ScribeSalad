us about the importance of random

00:03:53.119 --> 00:03:53.129

reinforcement so we did these

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290

experiments with rats where he set it up

00:03:58.309 --> 00:03:58.319
experiments with rats where he set it up
 

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:00.199
experiments with rats where he set it up
so that the rat would come up and push a

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:00.209
so that the rat would come up and push a
 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:03.740
so that the rat would come up and push a
lever and when they did that food would

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750
lever and when they did that food would
 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:07.520
lever and when they did that food would
come out awesome what he learned though

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530
come out awesome what he learned though
 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:09.110
come out awesome what he learned though
is that if you set up the lever

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120
is that if you set up the lever
 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:10.969
is that if you set up the lever
differently so that food doesn't come

00:04:10.969 --> 00:04:10.979
differently so that food doesn't come
 

00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:13.580
differently so that food doesn't come

two that I see time and time again and
if we think about you know this is in

00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:11.410
if we think about you know this is in
 

00:18:11.410 --> 00:18:13.830
if we think about you know this is in
our office every day we come in we focus

00:18:13.830 --> 00:18:13.840
our office every day we come in we focus
 

00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:16.310
our office every day we come in we focus
on how do I change these two numbers

00:18:16.310 --> 00:18:16.320
on how do I change these two numbers
 

00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:20.039
on how do I change these two numbers
what's the obvious answer notifications

00:18:20.039 --> 00:18:20.049
what's the obvious answer notifications
 

00:18:20.049 --> 00:18:23.010
what's the obvious answer notifications
I can do I can ping with notifications

00:18:23.010 --> 00:18:23.020
I can do I can ping with notifications
 

00:18:23.020 --> 00:18:25.710
I can do I can ping with notifications
right now and I will move the needle on

00:18:25.710 --> 00:18:25.720
right now and I will move the needle on
 

00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:29.340
right now and I will move the needle on
those two things for sure but the

00:18:29.340 --> 00:18:29.350
those two things for sure but the
 

00:18:29.350 --> 00:18:32.340
those two things for sure but the
challenge is that when we're sending a

00:18:32.340 --> 00:18:32.350
challenge is that when we're sending a
 

00:18:32.350 --> 00:18:34.350
challenge is that when we're sending a
notification two things are actually

00:18:34.350 --> 00:18:34.360
notification two things are actually

blip right in engagement right now but

00:18:40.380 --> 00:18:40.390
blip right in engagement right now but
 

00:18:40.390 --> 00:18:41.399
blip right in engagement right now but
you're also getting long term

00:18:41.399 --> 00:18:41.409
you're also getting long term
 

00:18:41.409 --> 00:18:44.220
you're also getting long term
deterioration but we're not seeing that

00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:44.230
deterioration but we're not seeing that
 

00:18:44.230 --> 00:18:46.110
deterioration but we're not seeing that
we're not looking at that with such an

00:18:46.110 --> 00:18:46.120
we're not looking at that with such an
 

00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:48.240
we're not looking at that with such an
intense focus that we have on these

00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:48.250
intense focus that we have on these
 

00:18:48.250 --> 00:18:50.430
intense focus that we have on these
short-term measures and I'm not saying

00:18:50.430 --> 00:18:50.440
short-term measures and I'm not saying
 

00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:51.480
short-term measures and I'm not saying
that we shouldn't measure these

00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:51.490
that we shouldn't measure these
 

00:18:51.490 --> 00:18:53.310
that we shouldn't measure these
short-term things I'm saying that we

00:18:53.310 --> 00:18:53.320
short-term things I'm saying that we
 

00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:55.590
short-term things I'm saying that we
should create a better balance we should

00:18:55.590 --> 00:18:55.600
should create a better balance we should
 

00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:57.990
should create a better balance we should
focus more on these longer-term measures

00:18:57.990 --> 00:18:58.000
focus more on these longer-term measures
 

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:01.230

reason we rely so heavily on short-term

00:19:11.669 --> 00:19:11.679
reason we rely so heavily on short-term
 

00:19:11.679 --> 00:19:13.110
reason we rely so heavily on short-term
measures is because it's way easier to

00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:13.120
measures is because it's way easier to
 

00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:15.060

right now what would we see remember a
 

00:20:29.850 --> 00:20:31.399
right now what would we see remember a
dashboard we would actually see that

the drivers would sign off the drivers

00:20:34.820 --> 00:20:34.830
the drivers would sign off the drivers
 

00:20:34.830 --> 00:20:36.490
the drivers would sign off the drivers
that we pinged with this notification

00:20:36.490 --> 00:20:36.500
that we pinged with this notification
 

00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:41.779
that we pinged with this notification
active users go down but think about the

00:20:41.779 --> 00:20:41.789
active users go down but think about the
 

00:20:41.789 --> 00:20:44.960
active users go down but think about the
long-term effect on that driver instead

00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:44.970
long-term effect on that driver instead
 

00:20:44.970 --> 00:20:46.369
long-term effect on that driver instead
of someone who is I'm not suggesting

that lyft does this but if instead of a

you you've driven probably enough right

00:20:56.600 --> 00:20:56.610
you you've driven probably enough right
 

00:20:56.610 --> 00:20:57.830
you you've driven probably enough right
now and there's not that much demand

00:20:57.830 --> 00:20:57.840
now and there's not that much demand
 

00:20:57.840 --> 00:21:00.830
now and there's not that much demand
anyway and we're in where you are think

anyway and we're in where you are think
about how that person feels and so this

about how that person feels and so this
 

00:21:03.570 --> 00:21:05.269
about how that person feels and so this
is just one example and you can come up

00:21:05.269 --> 00:21:05.279
is just one example and you can come up
 

00:21:05.279 --> 00:21:09.289
is just one example and you can come up
with your own as well so what is all of

00:21:09.289 --> 00:21:09.299
with your own as well so what is all of

this about what I'm trying to say here
 

00:21:12.389 --> 00:21:15.649
this about what I'm trying to say here
is that it's our opportunity our time to

00:21:15.649 --> 00:21:15.659
is that it's our opportunity our time to
 

00:21:15.659 --> 00:21:18.320
is that it's our opportunity our time to
band together to create our own code of

with this before let's think of organic

00:21:37.970 --> 00:21:37.980
with this before let's think of organic

food imagine the time think back if you
can - before when before organic food

00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:44.610
can - before when before organic food
 

00:21:44.610 --> 00:21:48.019
can - before when before organic food
labels existed so you're the organic

00:21:48.019 --> 00:21:48.029
labels existed so you're the organic
 

00:21:48.029 --> 00:21:50.960

00:22:01.909 --> 00:22:01.919
so you're making your grapes and you're
 

00:22:01.919 --> 00:22:03.980
so you're making your grapes and you're
very proud of your grapes and they're

00:22:03.980 --> 00:22:03.990
very proud of your grapes and they're
 

00:22:03.990 --> 00:22:05.899
very proud of your grapes and they're
awesome and they go on the shelf and

00:22:05.899 --> 00:22:05.909
awesome and they go on the shelf and
 

00:22:05.909 --> 00:22:07.369
awesome and they go on the shelf and
they're competing with those other

00:22:07.369 --> 00:22:07.379
they're competing with those other
 

00:22:07.379 --> 00:22:09.400
they're competing with those other
grapes that have pesticides on them

00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:09.410
grapes that have pesticides on them
 

00:22:09.410 --> 00:22:11.140
grapes that have pesticides on them
and who and what's the difference the

00:22:11.140 --> 00:22:11.150
and who and what's the difference the
 

00:22:11.150 --> 00:22:12.610
and who and what's the difference the
only difference at that point is price

00:22:12.610 --> 00:22:12.620
only difference at that point is price
 

00:22:12.620 --> 00:22:15.040
only difference at that point is price
and you're gonna lose that battle

00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:15.050
and you're gonna lose that battle
 

00:22:15.050 --> 00:22:17.080
and you're gonna lose that battle
because at that point the consumer has

00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:17.090
because at that point the consumer has
 

00:22:17.090 --> 00:22:19.240
because at that point the consumer has
no understanding no idea well why would

00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:19.250
no understanding no idea well why would
 

00:22:19.250 --> 00:22:20.860
no understanding no idea well why would
I pay more for that's all I can see is

00:22:20.860 --> 00:22:20.870
I pay more for that's all I can see is
 

00:22:20.870 --> 00:22:24.280
I pay more for that's all I can see is
these grapes cost more and yet with the

00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:24.290
these grapes cost more and yet with the
 

00:22:24.290 --> 00:22:28.000
these grapes cost more and yet with the
label right this became a signifier a

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:28.010
label right this became a signifier a
 

00:22:28.010 --> 00:22:30.910
label right this became a signifier a
symbol of the fact that this these

00:22:30.910 --> 00:22:30.920
symbol of the fact that this these
 

00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:33.640
symbol of the fact that this these
grapes this product was made with a

00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:33.650
grapes this product was made with a
 

00:22:33.650 --> 00:22:35.140
grapes this product was made with a
different set of standards with a

00:22:35.140 --> 00:22:35.150
different set of standards with a
 

00:22:35.150 --> 00:22:36.790
different set of standards with a
different set of norms it's in a

00:22:36.790 --> 00:22:36.800
different set of norms it's in a
 

00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:38.950
different set of norms it's in a
different category and so I think this

00:22:38.950 --> 00:22:38.960
different category and so I think this
 

00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:40.450
different category and so I think this
is a really nice example for us to think

00:22:40.450 --> 00:22:40.460
is a really nice example for us to think
 

00:22:40.460 --> 00:22:43.180
is a really nice example for us to think
about you know can we create something

00:22:43.180 --> 00:22:43.190
about you know can we create something
 

00:22:43.190 --> 00:22:46.330
about you know can we create something
similar to that the second example I

00:22:46.330 --> 00:22:46.340
similar to that the second example I
 

00:22:46.340 --> 00:22:49.450
similar to that the second example I
want to give you is also from food but

00:22:49.450 --> 00:22:49.460
want to give you is also from food but
 

00:22:49.460 --> 00:22:52.570
want to give you is also from food but
it's from the UK so the British

00:22:52.570 --> 00:22:52.580
it's from the UK so the British
 

00:22:52.580 --> 00:22:55.390
it's from the UK so the British
government like our government as well

00:22:55.390 --> 00:22:55.400
government like our government as well
 

00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:58.030
government like our government as well
actually realize that hey we have a

00:22:58.030 --> 00:22:58.040
actually realize that hey we have a
 

00:22:58.040 --> 00:23:01.600
actually realize that hey we have a
problem with our population obesity

00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:01.610
problem with our population obesity
 

00:23:01.610 --> 00:23:03.310
problem with our population obesity
numbers are really way too high people

00:23:03.310 --> 00:23:03.320
numbers are really way too high people
 

00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:05.470
numbers are really way too high people
are very unhealthy how do we fix this

00:23:05.470 --> 00:23:05.480
are very unhealthy how do we fix this
 

00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:06.940
are very unhealthy how do we fix this
and so one of the things they did is

00:23:06.940 --> 00:23:06.950
and so one of the things they did is
 

00:23:06.950 --> 00:23:09.400
and so one of the things they did is
they turned to the food manufacturers

00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:09.410
they turned to the food manufacturers
 

00:23:09.410 --> 00:23:13.360
they turned to the food manufacturers
and said guess what we have two choices

00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:13.370
and said guess what we have two choices
 

00:23:13.370 --> 00:23:20.170
and said guess what we have two choices
here one we will regulate you we will

00:23:20.170 --> 00:23:20.180
here one we will regulate you we will
 

00:23:20.180 --> 00:23:21.310
here one we will regulate you we will
come up with a statement set of

00:23:21.310 --> 00:23:21.320
come up with a statement set of
 

00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:22.150
come up with a statement set of
standards that you're gonna have to

00:23:22.150 --> 00:23:22.160
standards that you're gonna have to
 

00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:23.770
standards that you're gonna have to
follow this process is going to be very

00:23:23.770 --> 00:23:23.780
follow this process is going to be very
 

00:23:23.780 --> 00:23:27.100
follow this process is going to be very
expensive very laborious and because we

00:23:27.100 --> 00:23:27.110
expensive very laborious and because we
 

00:23:27.110 --> 00:23:28.540
expensive very laborious and because we
you know are an outside function we

00:23:28.540 --> 00:23:28.550
you know are an outside function we
 

00:23:28.550 --> 00:23:30.070
you know are an outside function we
don't and we might not necessarily come

00:23:30.070 --> 00:23:30.080
don't and we might not necessarily come
 

00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:32.260
don't and we might not necessarily come
up with the right answers sorry can we

00:23:32.260 --> 00:23:32.270
up with the right answers sorry can we
 

00:23:32.270 --> 00:23:34.780
up with the right answers sorry can we
go back

00:23:34.780 --> 00:23:34.790
 

00:23:34.790 --> 00:23:37.630
so that was option a right we will

00:23:37.630 --> 00:23:37.640
so that was option a right we will
 

00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:41.110
so that was option a right we will
regulate you second option you guys

00:23:41.110 --> 00:23:41.120
regulate you second option you guys
 

00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:43.780
regulate you second option you guys
regulate yourselves what did the British

00:23:43.780 --> 00:23:43.790
regulate yourselves what did the British
 

00:23:43.790 --> 00:23:45.850
regulate yourselves what did the British
food manufacturers do they said

00:23:45.850 --> 00:23:45.860
food manufacturers do they said
 

00:23:45.860 --> 00:23:48.190
food manufacturers do they said
absolutely we will do that they banded

00:23:48.190 --> 00:23:48.200
absolutely we will do that they banded
 

00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:51.250
absolutely we will do that they banded
together they created a standards for

00:23:51.250 --> 00:23:51.260
together they created a standards for
 

00:23:51.260 --> 00:23:53.890
together they created a standards for
sugar content and all kinds of details

00:23:53.890 --> 00:23:53.900
sugar content and all kinds of details
 

00:23:53.900 --> 00:23:55.660
sugar content and all kinds of details
on how the products were able to be made

00:23:55.660 --> 00:23:55.670
on how the products were able to be made
 

00:23:55.670 --> 00:23:59.110
on how the products were able to be made
fat content etc they lowered all of

00:23:59.110 --> 00:23:59.120
fat content etc they lowered all of
 

00:23:59.120 --> 00:24:01.270
fat content etc they lowered all of
these right so across the board and this

00:24:01.270 --> 00:24:01.280
these right so across the board and this
 

00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:02.890
these right so across the board and this
was effort for them they were cost

00:24:02.890 --> 00:24:02.900
was effort for them they were cost
 

00:24:02.900 --> 00:24:04.930
was effort for them they were cost
involved any one of them couldn't have

00:24:04.930 --> 00:24:04.940
involved any one of them couldn't have
 

00:24:04.940 --> 00:24:06.400
involved any one of them couldn't have
done it individually the whole reason

00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:06.410
done it individually the whole reason
 

00:24:06.410 --> 00:24:07.930
done it individually the whole reason
why this worked is that they did it

00:24:07.930 --> 00:24:07.940
why this worked is that they did it
 

00:24:07.940 --> 00:24:10.450
why this worked is that they did it
together but then everyone won right

00:24:10.450 --> 00:24:10.460
together but then everyone won right
 

00:24:10.460 --> 00:24:12.310
together but then everyone won right
because consumers in the end ended up

00:24:12.310 --> 00:24:12.320
because consumers in the end ended up
 

00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:13.510
because consumers in the end ended up
with products that were a lot less

00:24:13.510 --> 00:24:13.520
with products that were a lot less
 

00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:16.810
with products that were a lot less
sugary so this is again our opportunity

00:24:16.810 --> 00:24:16.820
sugary so this is again our opportunity
 

00:24:16.820 --> 00:24:19.060
sugary so this is again our opportunity
to create something for ourselves

00:24:19.060 --> 00:24:19.070
to create something for ourselves
 

00:24:19.070 --> 00:24:21.130
to create something for ourselves
there's examples of this these are just

00:24:21.130 --> 00:24:21.140
there's examples of this these are just
 

00:24:21.140 --> 00:24:22.749
there's examples of this these are just
two that I've given

00:24:22.749 --> 00:24:22.759
two that I've given
 

00:24:22.759 --> 00:24:25.449
two that I've given
but ultimately it's time for us to

00:24:25.449 --> 00:24:25.459
but ultimately it's time for us to
 

00:24:25.459 --> 00:24:27.909
but ultimately it's time for us to
create our own white line to design a

00:24:27.909 --> 00:24:27.919
create our own white line to design a
 

00:24:27.919 --> 00:24:29.649
create our own white line to design a
system that works better for everyone

00:24:29.649 --> 00:24:29.659
system that works better for everyone
 

00:24:29.659 --> 00:24:31.940
system that works better for everyone
thank you

00:24:31.940 --> 00:24:31.950
