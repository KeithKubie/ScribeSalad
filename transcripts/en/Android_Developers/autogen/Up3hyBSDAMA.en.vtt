00:13:01.700 --> 00:13:01.710
physical device so what are three things
 

00:13:01.710 --> 00:13:04.210
physical device so what are three things
that we have done let's go through them

00:13:04.210 --> 00:13:04.220
that we have done let's go through them
 

00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:06.830
that we have done let's go through them
the first thing is we start off with the

00:13:06.830 --> 00:13:06.840
the first thing is we start off with the
 

00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:10.160
the first thing is we start off with the
same code base as a physical device and

00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:10.170
same code base as a physical device and
 

00:13:10.170 --> 00:13:11.690
same code base as a physical device and
when we say the same code base

00:13:11.690 --> 00:13:11.700
when we say the same code base
 

00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:14.900
when we say the same code base
we don't mean half a stack we mean the

00:13:14.900 --> 00:13:14.910
we don't mean half a stack we mean the
 

00:13:14.910 --> 00:13:17.510
we don't mean half a stack we mean the
whole stack and that includes the

00:13:17.510 --> 00:13:17.520
whole stack and that includes the
 

00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:20.030
whole stack and that includes the
hardware abstraction layer as well as

00:13:20.030 --> 00:13:20.040
hardware abstraction layer as well as
 

00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:21.690
hardware abstraction layer as well as
the init Linux kernel

00:13:21.690 --> 00:13:21.700

Windows Mac and Linux by paying a lot of

00:13:31.090 --> 00:13:31.100
Windows Mac and Linux by paying a lot of
 

00:13:31.100 --> 00:13:33.610
Windows Mac and Linux by paying a lot of
attention to performance so that you can

00:13:33.610 --> 00:13:33.620
attention to performance so that you can
 

00:13:33.620 --> 00:13:36.340
attention to performance so that you can
get the same feel using emulator as a

00:13:36.340 --> 00:13:36.350
get the same feel using emulator as a
 

00:13:36.350 --> 00:13:41.530
get the same feel using emulator as a
physical device so ok fine you know

00:13:41.530 --> 00:13:41.540
physical device so ok fine you know
 

00:13:41.540 --> 00:13:44.140
physical device so ok fine you know
you've done the code but that's all good

00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:44.150
you've done the code but that's all good
 

00:13:44.150 --> 00:13:49.150
you've done the code but that's all good
developers do we test it so we are now

00:13:49.150 --> 00:13:49.160
developers do we test it so we are now
 

00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:54.190
developers do we test it so we are now
running over 900,000 compatibility tests

00:13:54.190 --> 00:13:54.200
running over 900,000 compatibility tests
 

00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:57.990
running over 900,000 compatibility tests
and these are the same tests that pass

00:13:57.990 --> 00:13:58.000
and these are the same tests that pass
 

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.210

with your fiscal phone so your fiscal

00:14:01.210 --> 00:14:01.220
with your fiscal phone so your fiscal
 

00:14:01.220 --> 00:14:03.250
with your fiscal phone so your fiscal
phone passed these tests and the

phone passed these tests and the
 

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:05.710
phone passed these tests and the
emulator passed the same test and you

00:14:05.710 --> 00:14:05.720
emulator passed the same test and you
 

00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:09.040
emulator passed the same test and you
might go yeah oh you know 900,000 big

of this and why is that when we go
 

00:14:47.870 --> 00:14:50.080
of this and why is that when we go
through the code base these kinds of

00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:50.090
through the code base these kinds of
 

00:14:50.090 --> 00:14:52.870
through the code base these kinds of
things were in it we basically run one

we run a completely different set of
 

00:14:57.200 --> 00:15:00.310
we run a completely different set of
code if it is running in the emulator so

00:15:00.310 --> 00:15:00.320
code if it is running in the emulator so
 

00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:02.110

how about how does it actually fit into
 

00:17:24.829 --> 00:17:27.159
how about how does it actually fit into
your workflow so let's talk about the

00:17:27.159 --> 00:17:27.169
your workflow so let's talk about the
 

00:17:27.169 --> 00:17:31.180
your workflow so let's talk about the
versatility of the emulator itself my

00:17:31.180 --> 00:17:31.190
versatility of the emulator itself my
 

00:17:31.190 --> 00:17:33.210
versatility of the emulator itself my
own personal favorite feature is

00:17:33.210 --> 00:17:33.220
own personal favorite feature is
 

00:17:33.220 --> 00:17:37.210
own personal favorite feature is
snapshot how many of you have basically

00:17:37.210 --> 00:17:37.220
snapshot how many of you have basically
 

00:17:37.220 --> 00:17:39.490
snapshot how many of you have basically
install an app run through the flow and

00:17:39.490 --> 00:17:39.500
install an app run through the flow and
 

00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:42.039
install an app run through the flow and
you realize oh actually you tested again

00:17:42.039 --> 00:17:42.049
you realize oh actually you tested again
 

00:17:42.049 --> 00:17:44.710
you realize oh actually you tested again
which means uninstalling your app and

00:17:44.710 --> 00:17:44.720
which means uninstalling your app and
 

00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:46.990
which means uninstalling your app and
then basically reset up the entire thing

00:17:46.990 --> 00:17:47.000
then basically reset up the entire thing
 

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.220
then basically reset up the entire thing
again show me your hands

00:17:49.220 --> 00:17:49.230
again show me your hands
 

00:17:49.230 --> 00:17:54.110
again show me your hands
yay okay so this feature is for you I

00:17:54.110 --> 00:17:54.120
yay okay so this feature is for you I
 

00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:56.580
yay okay so this feature is for you I
don't think you have done all your setup

00:17:56.580 --> 00:17:56.590
don't think you have done all your setup
 

00:17:56.590 --> 00:17:59.010
don't think you have done all your setup
steps you can just tell the emulator to

00:17:59.010 --> 00:17:59.020
steps you can just tell the emulator to
 

00:17:59.020 --> 00:18:01.770
steps you can just tell the emulator to
save a snapshot and when you're ready to

00:18:01.770 --> 00:18:01.780
save a snapshot and when you're ready to
 

00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:04.530
save a snapshot and when you're ready to
test again from exactly that particular

00:18:04.530 --> 00:18:04.540
test again from exactly that particular
 

00:18:04.540 --> 00:18:08.040
test again from exactly that particular
point you can just click on the one

00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:08.050
point you can just click on the one
 

00:18:08.050 --> 00:18:10.200
point you can just click on the one
button and basic get back right back to

button and basic get back right back to
 

00:18:10.210 --> 00:18:12.870
button and basic get back right back to
that point can we switch to the laptop

00:18:12.870 --> 00:18:12.880
that point can we switch to the laptop
 

00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:14.430
that point can we switch to the laptop
please and Frank will demonstrate this

00:18:14.430 --> 00:18:14.440
please and Frank will demonstrate this
 

00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:17.960

so I'm gonna demonstrate this little
 

00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:23.670
so I'm gonna demonstrate this little
thing where oftentimes snapshots can be

00:18:23.670 --> 00:18:23.680
thing where oftentimes snapshots can be
 

00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:25.050
thing where oftentimes snapshots can be
useful for when you want to put your

00:18:25.050 --> 00:18:25.060
useful for when you want to put your
 

00:18:25.060 --> 00:18:28.020
useful for when you want to put your
device in a particular state that is

00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:28.030
device in a particular state that is
 

00:18:28.030 --> 00:18:30.810
device in a particular state that is
easy to get back to this is especially

00:18:30.810 --> 00:18:30.820
easy to get back to this is especially
 

00:18:30.820 --> 00:18:33.510
easy to get back to this is especially
going to be an issue in new foldable

00:18:33.510 --> 00:18:33.520
going to be an issue in new foldable
 

00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:35.790
going to be an issue in new foldable
devices where split-screen may be more

00:18:35.790 --> 00:18:35.800
devices where split-screen may be more
 

00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:38.340
devices where split-screen may be more
prominent so the demonstrate split

00:18:38.340 --> 00:18:38.350
prominent so the demonstrate split
 

00:18:38.350 --> 00:18:40.110
prominent so the demonstrate split

split screen so now we have another

00:18:58.050 --> 00:18:58.060
split screen so now we have another
 

00:18:58.060 --> 00:19:00.150
split screen so now we have another
window pane in which we can potentially

00:19:00.150 --> 00:19:00.160
window pane in which we can potentially
 

00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:03.840
window pane in which we can potentially
launch a different application now when

00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:03.850
launch a different application now when
 

00:19:03.850 --> 00:19:05.730
launch a different application now when
you're testing this multi window app one

00:19:05.730 --> 00:19:05.740
you're testing this multi window app one
 

00:19:05.740 --> 00:19:07.080
you're testing this multi window app one
of the things that might happen is you

00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:07.090
of the things that might happen is you
 

00:19:07.090 --> 00:19:09.540
of the things that might happen is you
might launch an unreasonable activity

00:19:09.540 --> 00:19:09.550
might launch an unreasonable activity
 

00:19:09.550 --> 00:19:12.720
might launch an unreasonable activity
and now when you launch that the system

00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:12.730
and now when you launch that the system
 

00:19:12.730 --> 00:19:15.480
and now when you launch that the system
has no choice but to cancel split screen

00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:15.490
has no choice but to cancel split screen
 

00:19:15.490 --> 00:19:18.750
has no choice but to cancel split screen
mode and put you in this fixed aspect

00:19:18.750 --> 00:19:18.760
mode and put you in this fixed aspect
 

00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:21.870
mode and put you in this fixed aspect
ratio mode right here and now if you

00:19:21.870 --> 00:19:21.880
ratio mode right here and now if you
 

00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:24.020
ratio mode right here and now if you
want to retest that original scenario

00:19:24.020 --> 00:19:24.030
want to retest that original scenario
 

00:19:24.030 --> 00:19:26.280
want to retest that original scenario
you need to click through what I just

00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:26.290
you need to click through what I just
 

00:19:26.290 --> 00:19:30.060
you need to click through what I just
did again but with the snapshots once

00:19:30.060 --> 00:19:30.070
did again but with the snapshots once
 

00:19:30.070 --> 00:19:32.670
did again but with the snapshots once
you have saved your device in a state

00:19:32.670 --> 00:19:32.680
you have saved your device in a state
 

00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:35.520
you have saved your device in a state
where that staked out you like you can

00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:35.530
where that staked out you like you can

click play down here and it will load
 

00:19:38.110 --> 00:19:41.580
click play down here and it will load
the snapshot and I guess it's still

00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:41.590
the snapshot and I guess it's still
 

00:19:41.590 --> 00:19:47.710
the snapshot and I guess it's still
loading but yeah that is live demo yeah

00:19:47.710 --> 00:19:47.720
loading but yeah that is live demo yeah

load it and then it's in the state that

00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:53.770
load it and then it's in the state that
 

00:19:53.770 --> 00:19:56.720
load it and then it's in the state that
you were using before and you can then

00:19:56.720 --> 00:19:56.730
you were using before and you can then
 

00:19:56.730 --> 00:19:59.460
you were using before and you can then
pretty easily set up many other states

00:19:59.460 --> 00:19:59.470
pretty easily set up many other states
 

00:19:59.470 --> 00:20:01.740
pretty easily set up many other states
here and also change the name of your

00:20:01.740 --> 00:20:01.750
here and also change the name of your
 

00:20:01.750 --> 00:20:02.549
here and also change the name of your

00:20:02.549 --> 00:20:02.559
snapshot in every
 

00:20:02.559 --> 00:20:05.519
snapshot in every
thing so that's cool all right back to

00:20:05.519 --> 00:20:05.529
thing so that's cool all right back to
 

00:20:05.529 --> 00:20:08.450

slides cool thank you Frank

00:20:08.450 --> 00:20:08.460
slides cool thank you Frank
 

00:20:08.460 --> 00:20:11.549
slides cool thank you Frank
so in that scenario you might argue hey

00:20:11.549 --> 00:20:11.559
so in that scenario you might argue hey
 

00:20:11.559 --> 00:20:13.350
so in that scenario you might argue hey
you know it's just two steps you split

00:20:13.350 --> 00:20:13.360
you know it's just two steps you split
 

00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:15.450
you know it's just two steps you split
the screen but as many of you who have

00:20:15.450 --> 00:20:15.460
the screen but as many of you who have
 

00:20:15.460 --> 00:20:17.580
the screen but as many of you who have
raised your hand before you know you

00:20:17.580 --> 00:20:17.590
raised your hand before you know you
 

00:20:17.590 --> 00:20:19.919
raised your hand before you know you
might spend five minutes setting up your

00:20:19.919 --> 00:20:19.929
might spend five minutes setting up your
 

00:20:19.929 --> 00:20:21.930
might spend five minutes setting up your
app to a particular state before you go

00:20:21.930 --> 00:20:21.940
app to a particular state before you go
 

00:20:21.940 --> 00:20:24.330
app to a particular state before you go
on and test and what I usually do as

00:20:24.330 --> 00:20:24.340
on and test and what I usually do as
 

00:20:24.340 --> 00:20:26.669
on and test and what I usually do as
well is I will actually run through the

00:20:26.669 --> 00:20:26.679
well is I will actually run through the
 

00:20:26.679 --> 00:20:28.499
well is I will actually run through the
flow of my app and take several

00:20:28.499 --> 00:20:28.509
flow of my app and take several
 

00:20:28.509 --> 00:20:31.259
flow of my app and take several
snapshots around along the way which

00:20:31.259 --> 00:20:31.269
snapshots around along the way which
 

00:20:31.269 --> 00:20:34.139
snapshots around along the way which
saves me a ton of time when I want to

00:20:34.139 --> 00:20:34.149
saves me a ton of time when I want to
 

00:20:34.149 --> 00:20:36.090
saves me a ton of time when I want to
retest a particular bug fix or when I

00:20:36.090 --> 00:20:36.100
retest a particular bug fix or when I
 

00:20:36.100 --> 00:20:38.340
retest a particular bug fix or when I
want to just add a new feature at a

00:20:38.340 --> 00:20:38.350
want to just add a new feature at a
 

00:20:38.350 --> 00:20:40.830
want to just add a new feature at a
particular place and I can go right back

00:20:40.830 --> 00:20:40.840
particular place and I can go right back
 

00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:46.169
particular place and I can go right back
in so a perform step shot and we have

00:20:46.169 --> 00:20:46.179
in so a perform step shot and we have
 

00:20:46.179 --> 00:20:48.149
in so a perform step shot and we have
done a lot of testing so now is your

00:20:48.149 --> 00:20:48.159
done a lot of testing so now is your
 

00:20:48.159 --> 00:20:50.489
done a lot of testing so now is your
turn and what's better than running one

00:20:50.489 --> 00:20:50.499
turn and what's better than running one
 

00:20:50.499 --> 00:20:54.389
turn and what's better than running one
test running multiple tests at the same

00:20:54.389 --> 00:20:54.399
test running multiple tests at the same
 

00:20:54.399 --> 00:20:57.330
test running multiple tests at the same
time so another feature that the enter

00:20:57.330 --> 00:20:57.340
time so another feature that the enter
 

00:20:57.340 --> 00:20:59.340
time so another feature that the enter
emulator support is having multiple

00:20:59.340 --> 00:20:59.350
emulator support is having multiple
 

00:20:59.350 --> 00:21:02.489
emulator support is having multiple
instances running different tests at the

00:21:02.489 --> 00:21:02.499
instances running different tests at the
 

00:21:02.499 --> 00:21:05.669
instances running different tests at the
same time another way that I use this is

00:21:05.669 --> 00:21:05.679
same time another way that I use this is
 

00:21:05.679 --> 00:21:08.909
same time another way that I use this is
to test the same app on different screen

00:21:08.909 --> 00:21:08.919
to test the same app on different screen
 

00:21:08.919 --> 00:21:11.940
to test the same app on different screen
configurations and this doesn't just

00:21:11.940 --> 00:21:11.950
configurations and this doesn't just
 

00:21:11.950 --> 00:21:14.159
configurations and this doesn't just
work for the phone form-factor

00:21:14.159 --> 00:21:14.169
work for the phone form-factor
 

00:21:14.169 --> 00:21:16.769
work for the phone form-factor
it also works for large screen and photo

00:21:16.769 --> 00:21:16.779
it also works for large screen and photo
 

00:21:16.779 --> 00:21:21.720
it also works for large screen and photo
bows as well and another thing about the

00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:21.730
bows as well and another thing about the
 

00:21:21.730 --> 00:21:24.419
bows as well and another thing about the
emulator is quite often you know you

00:21:24.419 --> 00:21:24.429
emulator is quite often you know you
 

00:21:24.429 --> 00:21:26.519
emulator is quite often you know you
have different devices available in

00:21:26.519 --> 00:21:26.529
have different devices available in
 

00:21:26.529 --> 00:21:28.919
have different devices available in
different geographies and in this very

00:21:28.919 --> 00:21:28.929
different geographies and in this very
 

00:21:28.929 --> 00:21:31.289
different geographies and in this very
case photo bows are actually pretty hard

00:21:31.289 --> 00:21:31.299
case photo bows are actually pretty hard
 

00:21:31.299 --> 00:21:34.379
case photo bows are actually pretty hard
to get even when you're working in

you to take a look and I'm sure that you
have got many more questions about this

00:21:53.700 --> 00:21:53.710
have got many more questions about this
 

00:21:53.710 --> 00:21:55.590
have got many more questions about this
new form factor and also the larger

what about other things you can do with

00:22:18.990 --> 00:22:19.000
what about other things you can do with
 

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:21.590
what about other things you can do with
multiple instances of the emulator

00:22:21.590 --> 00:22:21.600
multiple instances of the emulator
 

00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:23.999
multiple instances of the emulator
another one my favorite is basically

00:22:23.999 --> 00:22:24.009
another one my favorite is basically
 

00:22:24.009 --> 00:22:26.490
another one my favorite is basically
running different instances but running

00:22:26.490 --> 00:22:26.500
running different instances but running

running different instances but running
different API levels I'm sure that a lot

00:22:29.370 --> 00:22:29.380
different API levels I'm sure that a lot
 

00:22:29.380 --> 00:22:31.139
different API levels I'm sure that a lot
of you will go through the behavior

00:22:31.139 --> 00:22:31.149
of you will go through the behavior
 

00:22:31.149 --> 00:22:33.570

this let me test that this makes it

00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:39.850
this let me test that this makes it
 

00:22:39.850 --> 00:22:43.740
this let me test that this makes it
super-easy to test the different API

00:22:43.740 --> 00:22:43.750
super-easy to test the different API
 

00:22:43.750 --> 00:22:48.180
super-easy to test the different API
levels such as in this example the share

00:22:48.180 --> 00:22:48.190
levels such as in this example the share
 

00:22:48.190 --> 00:22:50.940

screen have been changed in android q so

00:22:50.940 --> 00:22:50.950
screen have been changed in android q so
 

00:22:50.950 --> 00:22:53.519
screen have been changed in android q so
you can now test it right next to an

00:22:53.519 --> 00:22:53.529
you can now test it right next to an
 

00:22:53.529 --> 00:22:58.619
you can now test it right next to an
Oreo device or emulator rather so Frank

00:22:58.619 --> 00:22:58.629
Oreo device or emulator rather so Frank
 

00:22:58.629 --> 00:23:00.269
Oreo device or emulator rather so Frank
can you show us how this could be done

00:23:00.269 --> 00:23:00.279
can you show us how this could be done
 

00:23:00.279 --> 00:23:02.899
can you show us how this could be done
the different types of testing indeed

00:23:02.899 --> 00:23:02.909
the different types of testing indeed
 

00:23:02.909 --> 00:23:07.919
the different types of testing indeed
let's switch a lot of things like so

00:23:07.919 --> 00:23:07.929
let's switch a lot of things like so
 

00:23:07.929 --> 00:23:09.690
let's switch a lot of things like so
there are many different things that you

00:23:09.690 --> 00:23:09.700
there are many different things that you
 

00:23:09.700 --> 00:23:11.519
there are many different things that you
can do with multiple instances of

00:23:11.519 --> 00:23:11.529
can do with multiple instances of
 

00:23:11.529 --> 00:23:14.669
can do with multiple instances of
emulators and there are different

00:23:14.669 --> 00:23:14.679
emulators and there are different
 

00:23:14.679 --> 00:23:17.850
emulators and there are different
degrees so the first one which we

00:23:17.850 --> 00:23:17.860
degrees so the first one which we
 

00:23:17.860 --> 00:23:20.220
degrees so the first one which we
introduced recently is the rage or run

00:23:20.220 --> 00:23:20.230
introduced recently is the rage or run
 

00:23:20.230 --> 00:23:22.799
introduced recently is the rage or run
more than one instance of the same AVD

00:23:22.799 --> 00:23:22.809
more than one instance of the same AVD
 

00:23:22.809 --> 00:23:25.560
more than one instance of the same AVD
note that previously you needed to

00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:25.570
note that previously you needed to
 

00:23:25.570 --> 00:23:27.330
note that previously you needed to
create more than one AVD if you wanted

00:23:27.330 --> 00:23:27.340
create more than one AVD if you wanted
 

00:23:27.340 --> 00:23:28.769
create more than one AVD if you wanted
to run more than one emulator in

00:23:28.769 --> 00:23:28.779
to run more than one emulator in
 

00:23:28.779 --> 00:23:30.840
to run more than one emulator in
parallel well now you don't have to I

00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:30.850
parallel well now you don't have to I
 

00:23:30.850 --> 00:23:33.899
parallel well now you don't have to I
have a terminal open with a script to

00:23:33.899 --> 00:23:33.909
have a terminal open with a script to
 

00:23:33.909 --> 00:23:36.180
have a terminal open with a script to
launch multiple instances of the same

00:23:36.180 --> 00:23:36.190
launch multiple instances of the same
 

00:23:36.190 --> 00:23:39.710
launch multiple instances of the same
AVD called launch multi instance Sh

00:23:39.710 --> 00:23:39.720
AVD called launch multi instance Sh
 

00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:42.779
AVD called launch multi instance Sh
now you'll notice that this command line

00:23:42.779 --> 00:23:42.789
now you'll notice that this command line
 

00:23:42.789 --> 00:23:44.970
now you'll notice that this command line
is pretty typical except for the fact

00:23:44.970 --> 00:23:44.980
is pretty typical except for the fact
 

00:23:44.980 --> 00:23:47.070
is pretty typical except for the fact
that you have this new command line flag

00:23:47.070 --> 00:23:47.080
that you have this new command line flag
 

00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:50.759
that you have this new command line flag
here read-only and the AVD name is the

00:23:50.759 --> 00:23:50.769
here read-only and the AVD name is the
 

00:23:50.769 --> 00:23:53.190
here read-only and the AVD name is the
same in both cases now why is this

00:23:53.190 --> 00:23:53.200
same in both cases now why is this
 

00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:56.490
same in both cases now why is this
significant well read-only will

00:23:56.490 --> 00:23:56.500
significant well read-only will
 

00:23:56.500 --> 00:23:58.919
significant well read-only will
essentially let you launch more than one

00:23:58.919 --> 00:23:58.929
essentially let you launch more than one
 

00:23:58.929 --> 00:24:02.669
essentially let you launch more than one
instance of an AV D at the same time so

00:24:02.669 --> 00:24:02.679
instance of an AV D at the same time so
 

00:24:02.679 --> 00:24:04.379
instance of an AV D at the same time so
when you launch this script it will

00:24:04.379 --> 00:24:04.389
when you launch this script it will
 

00:24:04.389 --> 00:24:06.379
when you launch this script it will
launch both of them in the background in

00:24:06.379 --> 00:24:06.389
launch both of them in the background in
 

00:24:06.389 --> 00:24:09.629
launch both of them in the background in
addition if you add the read-only option

00:24:09.629 --> 00:24:09.639
addition if you add the read-only option
 

00:24:09.639 --> 00:24:11.669
addition if you add the read-only option
and you're booting off of a quick boost

00:24:11.669 --> 00:24:11.679
and you're booting off of a quick boost
 

00:24:11.679 --> 00:24:14.850
and you're booting off of a quick boost
nap shot you're only going to restore to

00:24:14.850 --> 00:24:14.860
nap shot you're only going to restore to
 

00:24:14.860 --> 00:24:17.039
nap shot you're only going to restore to
that previous snapshot and discard all

00:24:17.039 --> 00:24:17.049
that previous snapshot and discard all
 

00:24:17.049 --> 00:24:19.139
that previous snapshot and discard all
of the changes to the snapshot once you

00:24:19.139 --> 00:24:19.149
of the changes to the snapshot once you
 

00:24:19.149 --> 00:24:21.539
of the changes to the snapshot once you
exit so once you launch it again you're

00:24:21.539 --> 00:24:21.549
exit so once you launch it again you're
 

00:24:21.549 --> 00:24:23.460
exit so once you launch it again you're
going to be in the same exact state that

00:24:23.460 --> 00:24:23.470
going to be in the same exact state that
 

00:24:23.470 --> 00:24:25.049
going to be in the same exact state that
you started with when you last saved the

00:24:25.049 --> 00:24:25.059
you started with when you last saved the
 

00:24:25.059 --> 00:24:26.879
you started with when you last saved the
quick boot snapshot I will demonstrate

00:24:26.879 --> 00:24:26.889
quick boot snapshot I will demonstrate
 

00:24:26.889 --> 00:24:32.419
quick boot snapshot I will demonstrate
now

00:24:32.419 --> 00:24:32.429
 
 

00:24:32.429 --> 00:24:35.970
 
so this is actually two emulators and

00:24:35.970 --> 00:24:35.980
so this is actually two emulators and
 

00:24:35.980 --> 00:24:39.930
so this is actually two emulators and
they're all running independently and if

00:24:39.930 --> 00:24:39.940
they're all running independently and if
 

00:24:39.940 --> 00:24:44.700
they're all running independently and if
we look in say let's clear the terminal

00:24:44.700 --> 00:24:44.710
we look in say let's clear the terminal
 

00:24:44.710 --> 00:24:49.590
we look in say let's clear the terminal
a B devices we have two devices and with

00:24:49.590 --> 00:24:49.600
a B devices we have two devices and with
 

00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:52.350
a B devices we have two devices and with
we can run integration tests as if we

00:24:52.350 --> 00:24:52.360
we can run integration tests as if we
 

00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:55.500
we can run integration tests as if we
actually had two devices so for example

00:24:55.500 --> 00:24:55.510
actually had two devices so for example
 

00:24:55.510 --> 00:24:59.850
actually had two devices so for example
if I try to run this instrumentation

00:24:59.850 --> 00:24:59.860
if I try to run this instrumentation
 

00:24:59.860 --> 00:25:07.289
if I try to run this instrumentation
test here the adb shell am instrument it

00:25:07.289 --> 00:25:07.299
test here the adb shell am instrument it
 

00:25:07.299 --> 00:25:10.620
test here the adb shell am instrument it
can run on parallel on both devices at

00:25:10.620 --> 00:25:10.630
can run on parallel on both devices at
 

00:25:10.630 --> 00:25:14.730
can run on parallel on both devices at
the same time so one test is running on

00:25:14.730 --> 00:25:14.740
the same time so one test is running on
 

00:25:14.740 --> 00:25:17.130
the same time so one test is running on
one device and a different test is

00:25:17.130 --> 00:25:17.140
one device and a different test is
 

00:25:17.140 --> 00:25:19.230
one device and a different test is
running on the other device so you can

00:25:19.230 --> 00:25:19.240
running on the other device so you can
 

00:25:19.240 --> 00:25:21.230
running on the other device so you can
get kind of test charting pretty easily

00:25:21.230 --> 00:25:21.240
get kind of test charting pretty easily
 

00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:23.640
get kind of test charting pretty easily
one last thing to mention about resuming

00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:23.650
one last thing to mention about resuming
 

00:25:23.650 --> 00:25:26.760
one last thing to mention about resuming
these AVD clones from the same snapshot

00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:26.770
these AVD clones from the same snapshot
 

00:25:26.770 --> 00:25:29.399
these AVD clones from the same snapshot
is that their RAM is shared until it's

00:25:29.399 --> 00:25:29.409
is that their RAM is shared until it's
 

00:25:29.409 --> 00:25:31.560
is that their RAM is shared until it's
written it's called copy-on-write so

00:25:31.560 --> 00:25:31.570
written it's called copy-on-write so
 

00:25:31.570 --> 00:25:34.140
written it's called copy-on-write so
this is also using less RAM than if you

00:25:34.140 --> 00:25:34.150
this is also using less RAM than if you
 

00:25:34.150 --> 00:25:37.970
this is also using less RAM than if you
started to independent a VDS so that's

00:25:37.970 --> 00:25:37.980
started to independent a VDS so that's
 

00:25:37.980 --> 00:25:41.909
started to independent a VDS so that's
the same a VD in sense but what if you

00:25:41.909 --> 00:25:41.919
the same a VD in sense but what if you
 

00:25:41.919 --> 00:25:43.169
the same a VD in sense but what if you
are testing multiple screen

00:25:43.169 --> 00:25:43.179
are testing multiple screen
 

00:25:43.179 --> 00:25:44.220
are testing multiple screen
configurations

00:25:44.220 --> 00:25:44.230
configurations
 

00:25:44.230 --> 00:25:49.380

well let's launch a normal screen

00:25:49.380 --> 00:25:49.390
well let's launch a normal screen
 

00:25:49.390 --> 00:25:52.440
well let's launch a normal screen
configuration and one of the new

00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:52.450
configuration and one of the new
 

00:25:52.450 --> 00:26:01.390
configuration and one of the new
foldable ones let's see

00:26:01.390 --> 00:26:01.400
foldable ones let's see
 

00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:06.100
foldable ones let's see
and if we run the Santa tracker and the

00:26:06.100 --> 00:26:06.110
and if we run the Santa tracker and the
 

00:26:06.110 --> 00:26:07.570
and if we run the Santa tracker and the
emulator with normal screen

00:26:07.570 --> 00:26:07.580
emulator with normal screen
 

00:26:07.580 --> 00:26:09.370
emulator with normal screen
configuration it comes with a particular

00:26:09.370 --> 00:26:09.380
configuration it comes with a particular
 

00:26:09.380 --> 00:26:12.190
configuration it comes with a particular
layout however if you launch the

00:26:12.190 --> 00:26:12.200
layout however if you launch the
 

00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:15.490
layout however if you launch the
foldable emulator and then inside that

00:26:15.490 --> 00:26:15.500
foldable emulator and then inside that
 

00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:19.390
foldable emulator and then inside that
emulator you launch the same app you can

00:26:19.390 --> 00:26:19.400
emulator you launch the same app you can
 

00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:23.799
emulator you launch the same app you can
often get a different layout so running

00:26:23.799 --> 00:26:23.809
often get a different layout so running
 

00:26:23.809 --> 00:26:26.170
often get a different layout so running
multiple emulator screen configurations

00:26:26.170 --> 00:26:26.180
multiple emulator screen configurations
 

00:26:26.180 --> 00:26:28.299
multiple emulator screen configurations
this way lets you really quickly test

00:26:28.299 --> 00:26:28.309
this way lets you really quickly test
 

00:26:28.309 --> 00:26:30.730
this way lets you really quickly test
multiple screen configurations quickly

00:26:30.730 --> 00:26:30.740
multiple screen configurations quickly
 

00:26:30.740 --> 00:26:34.780
multiple screen configurations quickly
and since this is a foldable device I

00:26:34.780 --> 00:26:34.790
and since this is a foldable device I
 

00:26:34.790 --> 00:26:36.490
and since this is a foldable device I
have to also demonstrate the folding

00:26:36.490 --> 00:26:36.500
have to also demonstrate the folding
 

00:26:36.500 --> 00:26:40.210
have to also demonstrate the folding
feature so with a foldable device the

00:26:40.210 --> 00:26:40.220
feature so with a foldable device the
 

00:26:40.220 --> 00:26:43.600
feature so with a foldable device the
app layout will change a lot if you fold

00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:43.610
app layout will change a lot if you fold
 

00:26:43.610 --> 00:26:46.060
app layout will change a lot if you fold
and unfold and so the foldable virtual

00:26:46.060 --> 00:26:46.070
and unfold and so the foldable virtual
 

00:26:46.070 --> 00:26:48.010
and unfold and so the foldable virtual
devices give you a quick way to test

00:26:48.010 --> 00:26:48.020
devices give you a quick way to test
 

00:26:48.020 --> 00:26:51.669
devices give you a quick way to test
this all right so that's four different

00:26:51.669 --> 00:26:51.679
this all right so that's four different
 

00:26:51.679 --> 00:26:53.560
this all right so that's four different
screen configurations what about

00:26:53.560 --> 00:26:53.570
screen configurations what about
 

00:26:53.570 --> 00:27:00.130
screen configurations what about
different API levels in launch SDK

00:27:00.130 --> 00:27:00.140
different API levels in launch SDK
 

00:27:00.140 --> 00:27:02.380
different API levels in launch SDK
compat I will be launching two emulators

00:27:02.380 --> 00:27:02.390
compat I will be launching two emulators
 

00:27:02.390 --> 00:27:05.620
compat I will be launching two emulators
one of them is an API 27 Oreo and

the tests to fail and one of the tests
 

00:27:42.050 --> 00:27:45.580
the tests to fail and one of the tests
to succeed depending on the API level so

00:27:45.580 --> 00:27:45.590
to succeed depending on the API level so
 

00:27:45.590 --> 00:27:47.500

00:28:06.420 --> 00:28:08.790
 
so hopefully we have convinced that

00:28:08.790 --> 00:28:08.800
so hopefully we have convinced that
 

00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:11.220
so hopefully we have convinced that
convinced you that you should run all

00:28:11.220 --> 00:28:11.230
convinced you that you should run all
 

00:28:11.230 --> 00:28:12.840

into different sections one is you know

00:31:20.220 --> 00:31:20.230
into different sections one is you know
 

00:31:20.230 --> 00:31:22.830
into different sections one is you know
potentially your own app version another

third is a different API levels and you

00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:30.730
third is a different API levels and you
 

00:31:30.730 --> 00:31:33.389
third is a different API levels and you
might also want to have a look at the

00:31:33.389 --> 00:31:33.399
might also want to have a look at the
 

00:31:33.399 --> 00:31:35.999
might also want to have a look at the
kind of user feedback and you know where

00:31:35.999 --> 00:31:36.009
kind of user feedback and you know where
 

00:31:36.009 --> 00:31:37.799
kind of user feedback and you know where
the positive or negative depending on

00:31:37.799 --> 00:31:37.809
the positive or negative depending on
 

00:31:37.809 --> 00:31:40.230
the positive or negative depending on
the device as well and this is a kind of

00:31:40.230 --> 00:31:40.240
the device as well and this is a kind of
 

00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:43.470
the device as well and this is a kind of
workflow that I would go through so the

00:31:43.470 --> 00:31:43.480
workflow that I would go through so the
 

00:31:43.480 --> 00:31:45.210
workflow that I would go through so the
first thing that we do is I will have a

00:31:45.210 --> 00:31:45.220
first thing that we do is I will have a
 

00:31:45.220 --> 00:31:47.279
first thing that we do is I will have a
look at you know are there any

00:31:47.279 --> 00:31:47.289
look at you know are there any
 

00:31:47.289 --> 00:31:49.169
look at you know are there any
particular device studies causing a lot

00:31:49.169 --> 00:31:49.179

of crashes or injure or not being
 

00:31:51.940 --> 00:31:55.919
of crashes or injure or not being
responsive and if it is I would look up

00:31:55.919 --> 00:31:55.929
responsive and if it is I would look up
 

00:31:55.929 --> 00:31:58.560
responsive and if it is I would look up
what is the screen density is that hdpi

00:31:58.560 --> 00:31:58.570
what is the screen density is that hdpi
 

00:31:58.570 --> 00:32:01.830
what is the screen density is that hdpi
or is it other different screen size or

00:32:01.830 --> 00:32:01.840
or is it other different screen size or
 

00:32:01.840 --> 00:32:05.279
or is it other different screen size or
density once I get that I will launch an

00:32:05.279 --> 00:32:05.289
density once I get that I will launch an
 

00:32:05.289 --> 00:32:07.259
density once I get that I will launch an
emulator that matches that and just do a

00:32:07.259 --> 00:32:07.269
emulator that matches that and just do a
 

00:32:07.269 --> 00:32:10.019
emulator that matches that and just do a
sanity test that will be that's usually

00:32:10.019 --> 00:32:10.029
sanity test that will be that's usually
 

00:32:10.029 --> 00:32:13.200
sanity test that will be that's usually
very quick much much faster than me kind

00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:13.210
very quick much much faster than me kind
 

00:32:13.210 --> 00:32:14.999
very quick much much faster than me kind
of going down to the device lab and

00:32:14.999 --> 00:32:15.009
of going down to the device lab and
 

00:32:15.009 --> 00:32:18.840
of going down to the device lab and
checking a device out if it's not that

00:32:18.840 --> 00:32:18.850
checking a device out if it's not that
 

00:32:18.850 --> 00:32:21.299
checking a device out if it's not that
the next thing that we do is to look at

00:32:21.299 --> 00:32:21.309
the next thing that we do is to look at
 

00:32:21.309 --> 00:32:23.279
the next thing that we do is to look at
the API level and see whether the

00:32:23.279 --> 00:32:23.289
the API level and see whether the
 

00:32:23.289 --> 00:32:24.560
the API level and see whether the
crashes is actually caused by

00:32:24.560 --> 00:32:24.570
crashes is actually caused by
 

00:32:24.570 --> 00:32:27.359
crashes is actually caused by
differences in behavior of the different

00:32:27.359 --> 00:32:27.369
differences in behavior of the different
 

00:32:27.369 --> 00:32:31.400
differences in behavior of the different
API levels

00:32:31.400 --> 00:32:31.410
 
 

00:32:31.410 --> 00:32:35.220
