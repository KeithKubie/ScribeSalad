00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:04.640
Welcome to Part 2 on the
presentation on Level

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:06.110
1 exponent rules.

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:07.960
So let's start off by
reviewing the rules

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:09.340
we've learned already.

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:21.050
If I had 2 to the tenth times 2
to the fifth, we learned that

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:25.130
since we're multiplying
exponents with the same base,

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.410
we can add the exponent, so
this equals 2 to the fifteenth.

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:37.510
We also learned that if it was
2 to the tenth over 2 to the

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:41.690
fifth, we would actually
subtract the exponents.

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:46.150
So this would be 2 to
the 10 minus 5, which

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:48.680
equals 2 to the fifth.

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.460
At the end of the last
presentation, and I probably

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.970
shouldn't have introduced it
so fast, I introduced

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:54.070
a new concept.

00:00:54.070 --> 00:01:02.740
What happens if I have 2 to
the tenth to the fifth power?

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:04.380
Well, let's think about
what that means.

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:07.340
When I raise something to the
fifth power, that's just like

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:14.240
saying 2 to the tenth times 2
to the tenth times 2 to the

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:19.955
tenth times 2 to the tenth
times 2 to the tenth, right?

00:01:19.955 --> 00:01:22.465
All I did is I took 2 to
the tenth and I multiplied

00:01:22.465 --> 00:01:24.800
it by itself five times.

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.370
That's the fifth power.

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:30.550
Well, we know from this rule up
here that we can add these

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:33.280
exponents because they're
all the same base.

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.360
So if we add 10 plus 10
plus 10 plus 10 plus

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.050
10, what do we get?

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:42.480
Right, we get 2 to
the fiftieth power.

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.090
So essentially, what
did we do here?

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:50.420
All we did is we multiplied
10 times 5 to get 50.

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.480
So that's our third exponent
rule, that when I raise an

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:56.620
exponent to a power and then I
raise that whole expression to

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:00.940
another power, I can multiply
those two exponents.

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:02.400
So let me give you
another example.

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:12.340
If I said 3 to the 7, and all
of that to the negative 9, once

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:17.460
again, all I do is I multiply
the 7 and the negative 9, and

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:23.200
I get 3 to the minus 63.

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:28.670
So, you see, it works just as
easily with negative numbers.

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:33.465
So now, I'm going to teach you
one final exponent property.

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:45.740
Let's say I have 2 times 9,
and I raise that whole thing

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:48.710
to the hundredth power.

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:53.540
It turns out of this is equal
to 2 to the hundredth power

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:56.890
times 9 to the hundredth power.

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:58.180
Now let's make sure
that that makes sense.

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:59.880
Let's do it with a
smaller example.

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:06.190
What if it was 4 times
5 to the third power?

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:15.440
Well, that would just be equal
to 4 times 5 times 4 times 5

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:21.890
times 4 times 5, right, which
is the same thing as 4 times 4

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:26.410
times 4 times 5 times
5 times 5, right?

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:28.820
I just switched the order in
which I'm multiplying, which

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:30.730
you can do with multiplication.

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:33.030
Well, 4 times 4 times 4,
well, that's just equal

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:34.640
to 4 to the third.

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:39.220
And 5 times 5 times 5 is
equal to 5 to the third.

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.110
Hope that gives you a good
intuition of why this

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:43.350
property here is true.

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:46.170
And actually, when I had first
learned exponent rules, I would

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:48.480
always forget the rules, and I
would always do this proof

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.750
myself, or the other proofs.

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:52.700
And a proof is just an
explanation of why the rule

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:56.660
works, just to make sure
that I was doing it right.

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:00.080
So given everything that we've
learned to now-- actually, let

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:03.810
me review all of
the rules again.

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:10.390
If I have 2 to the seventh
times 2 to the third,

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:13.366
well, then I can add the
exponents, 2 to the tenth.

00:04:13.366 --> 00:04:20.080
If I have 2 the seventh over
2 the third, well, here I

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:24.580
subtract the exponents, and
I get 2 to the fourth.

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:30.910
If I have 2 to the seventh to
the third power, well, here

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:32.310
I multiplied the exponents.

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:35.180
That gives you 2 to the 21.

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:42.690
And if I had 2 times 7 to the
third power, well, that equals

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:47.650
2 to the third times
7 to the third.

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:52.260
Now, let's use all of these
rules we've learned to actually

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.500
try to do some, what I would
call, composite problems that

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:58.630
involve you using multiple
rules at the same time.

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:00.630
And a good composite problem
was that problem that I had

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:03.145
introduced you to at the
end of that last seminar.

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:20.330
Let's say I have 3 squared
times 9 to the eighth power,

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:25.780
and all of that I'm going to
raise to the negative 2 power.

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:27.250
So what can I do here?

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:32.970
Well, 3 and 9 are two separate
bases, but 9 can actually

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:35.760
be expressed as an
exponent of 3, right?

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:37.540
9 is the same thing as
3 squared, so let's

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:40.210
rewrite 9 like that.

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:44.650
That's equivalent to 3 squared
times-- 9 is the same thing as

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:50.520
3 squared to the eighth power,
and then all of that to the

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:52.350
negative 2 power, right?

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:54.330
All I did is I replaced 9
with 3 squared because

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:57.610
we know 3 times 3 is 9.

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:00.070
Well, now we can use the
multiplication rule on

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:01.630
this to simplify it.

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:09.500
So this is equal to 3 squared
times 3 to the 2 times 8,

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:15.230
which is 16, and all of
that to the negative 2.

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:16.610
Now, we can use the first rule.

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:18.960
We have the same base, so we
can add the exponents, and

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:23.280
we're multiplying them, so that
equals 3 to the eighteen power,

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:28.210
right, 2 plus 16, and all
that to the negative 2.

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:29.150
And now we're almost done.

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:31.870
We can once again use this
multiplication rule, and we

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:36.580
could say 3-- this is equal to
3 to the eighteenth times

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:42.220
negative 2, so that's
3 to the minus 36.

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:46.040
So this problem might have
seemed pretty daunting at

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:49.380
first, but there aren't that
many rules, and all you have to

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:51.580
do is keep seeing, oh, wow,
that little part of the

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:52.970
problem, I can simplify it.

00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:55.520
Then you simplify it, and
you'll see that you can keep

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:59.215
using rules until you get
to a much simpler answer.

00:06:59.215 --> 00:07:02.290
And actually the Level 1
problems don't even involve

00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:03.340
problems this difficult.

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:06.380
This'll be more on the
exponent rules, Level 2.

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:07.850
But I think at this
point you're ready

00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:10.125
to try the problems.

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:15.550
I'm kind of divided whether I
want you to memorize the rules

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:18.800
because I think it's better to
almost forget the rules and

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:20.740
have to prove it to yourself
over and over again to

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:22.010
the point that you
remember the rules.

00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:25.400
Because if you just memorize
the rules, later on in life

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:27.905
when you haven't done it for a
couple of years, you might kind

00:07:27.905 --> 00:07:29.340
of forget the rules, and
then you won't know how

00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:30.590
to get back to the rules.

00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:31.880
But it's up to you.

00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:35.160
I just hope you do understand
why these rules work, and as

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:36.616
long as you practice and you
pay attention to the signs,

00:07:36.616 --> 00:07:40.510
you should have no problems
with the Level 1 exercises.

00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:42.010
Have fun!
