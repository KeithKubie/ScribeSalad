00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.997
Whether its Mozart, Joni Mitchell,
Adele or newcomers like Frank Ocean,

00:00:03.997 --> 00:00:07.125
music is powerful and has existed in all
cultures throughout history.

00:00:07.125 --> 00:00:10.314
But why do humans find music
so addictive and pleasurable?

00:00:10.314 --> 00:00:14.714
At its core, music is the combination of audio
frequencies and intricate patterns

00:00:14.714 --> 00:00:17.020
floating through the air and
clashing together in your ear.

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:20.382
Much like your eyes process light, your ears process waves of sound

00:00:20.382 --> 00:00:23.230
and trigger a state of excitement
and sometimes pleasure in your brain.

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:27.071
Humans experience pleasure from many
stimulants such as food, sex and drugs.

00:00:27.071 --> 00:00:30.602
But because many of these stimulants
are necessary for human survival

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:34.203
the body has created a system
in which it rewards you for achieving them.

00:00:34.103 --> 00:00:38.231
What's really happening is a release
of a neurotransmitter in the brain called dopamine.

00:00:38.231 --> 00:00:41.502
Dopamine is a chemical responsible for
making you feel good.

00:00:41.502 --> 00:00:46.199
When dopamine is released following a reward
such as a delicious meal or winning the lottery,

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:49.629
the neurotransmitter causes a feeling
of pleasure and satisfaction.

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:54.530
Drugs, such as cocaine, take advantage of this
pathway by increasing the amount of dopamine,

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:56.338
or rather, preventing its removal,

00:00:56.338 --> 00:01:00.858
causing continual stimulation of your neurons,
which creates intense moments of pleasure.

00:01:00.858 --> 00:01:04.000
Music has the ability to create
a state of arousal

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.073
causing pupils to dilate

00:01:05.073 --> 00:01:06.225
blood pressure to rise, 

00:01:06.225 --> 00:01:09.499
and the brain to fire in
auditory, movement and emotional regions.

00:01:09.499 --> 00:01:12.491
And even though music does not have
a direct survival benefit,

00:01:12.491 --> 00:01:16.386
this emotional reaction causes a release of
the feel good chemical dopamine.

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.154
Though the exact evolutionary reasoning is unclear,

00:01:19.154 --> 00:01:20.881
the amazing fact remains,

00:01:20.881 --> 00:01:23.980
music chemically alters our body
and makes us feel great.

00:01:24.161 --> 00:01:27.823
And in the same way that a drug
induced dopamine surge leaves you craving more,

00:01:27.823 --> 00:01:29.412
music becomes addictive.

00:01:29.325 --> 00:01:31.624
The dopamine tells your body it was rewarded

00:01:31.624 --> 00:01:33.338
and creates the desire to seek out more.

00:01:33.338 --> 00:01:38.591
Even though music enjoyment is entirely subjective and
intertwined with cultural and personal experience

00:01:38.591 --> 00:01:41.622
The chemical effects remain consistent
amongst the human race,

00:01:41.622 --> 00:01:44.215
a perfectly natural drug of happiness.

00:01:44.215 --> 00:01:46.281
