00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:03.429
Over the decades, there have been many theories
as to where the first people to get to the

00:00:03.429 --> 00:00:17.180
New World originated, and now, thanks to DNA,
we likely have a definitive answer.

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:21.810
We humans have a couple million years behind
us, and it's taken us nearly that entire time

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.560
to spread across the planet. Anthropologists
know for a fact humans evolved in what is

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:31.190
now Ethiopia and Somalia. Eventually modern
humans stood up and started walking out of

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:34.569
Africa, but not long afterward, things get
a bit blurry.

00:00:34.569 --> 00:00:38.839
By following the fossil record, humans moved
from Eastern Africa into South Africa and

00:00:38.839 --> 00:00:43.309
onto the Arabian Peninsula. Over thousands
of years, modern Homo Sapiens migrated throughout

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:47.899
Europe and Asia, supplanting or interbreeding
with populations of Neanderthals and Homo

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:54.139
erectus. Eventually, modern humans spread
to the New World and populated there too,

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:59.350
but how humans made it over here -- when the
map makes it look SO. FAR. has been a puzzle

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:05.030
with many hypotheses, until DNA was discovered.

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.020
Before DNA, scientists looked at fossils and
traits and the geologic record and theorized

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:13.850
humans moved onto a land bridge which existed
between Asia and North America. The Bering

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:18.719
Land Bridge probably conjures pictures of,
well, a tiny little bridge. But it's a bridge

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:24.689
like France is a bridge from Spain to Germany;
it's also called the Bering Plain. The land

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:30.929
bridge was a massive amount of land connecting
the two continents. People moved ONTO the

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:36.609
bridge 23,000 years ago, and then moved OFF
the bridge maybe 15,000 years agoâ€¦

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:40.770
Now, new science has confirmed most of the
Bering Land Bridge theory, and added even

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.909
more specifics as to how First Peoples or
Native Americans found their way onto this

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.350
continent. A new paper in Science sequenced
the genomes of 23 ancient individuals and

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.429
31 living Native peoples and found a very
specific genetic history. DNA carries with

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:58.880
it a step-by-step record of interbreeding
and adaptations in its billions of quad-coded

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:04.240
nucleobases. Since the human genome was completely
sequenced in 2003, we don't know what everything

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.840
in there does, but we do have a baseline.

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:13.080
Here's what happened, no more than 23,000
years ago, Amerindians (as they called them)

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:18.190
moved from Siberia in a single wave and settled
in the north for thousands of years. From

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:22.620
there they split into two groups about 13,000
years ago. We know that the glaciers were

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.450
receding about then. That meant the land bridge
was shrinking. One group settled throughout

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.860
North America and while the other settled
in Central and South America! Incredibly,

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:37.310
they pinpointed the 13,000 year split figure,
based on the DNA from the remains of a single

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:42.010
12,600-year-old boy. As they sequence more
ancient individuals they'll get even more

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.030
precise migration estimates.

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:49.020
But that's not all, they also answered the
long-wondered question, where did the Natives

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:54.520
originate? According to the genetic information,
Native Americans have a small mix of genes

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:59.700
from East Asians and Australo-Melanesians.
Australoid and Melanesians are two racial

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:04.400
classifications which include Southeast Asian
hunter-gatherers, Papua New Guineans, Solomon

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:09.360
Islanders, Vanuatuans and Indigenous Australians!
Somehow, people from as far away as remote

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:16.490
islands in the South Pacific and Australia
were able to make their way to the New World.

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:20.520
It's mind-boggling to think of ancient people
migrating so far and mixing with the locals.

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:25.280
Today, more than 80-percent of our planet
has seen influence from human activity. Studies

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:29.680
like this show us just how little we know
about how we got here; and how much of an

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.150
impact we've made in such a short time on
our Earth..

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.330
Do you have a curiosity we can quench?
