00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:03.833
(upbeat music)

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:30.510
- Welcome to a Conversation With History.

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:31.940
I'm Harry Kreisler of

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:33.930
the Institute of International Studies.

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.937
Our distinguished guest
today is Amory Lovins,

00:00:36.937 --> 00:00:40.650
the Rocky Mountain Institute co-founder,

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:43.130
chairman and chief scientist.

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:46.770
He is a consultant,
experimental physicist,

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.850
educated at Harvard and Oxford.

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:52.700
He has received an Oxford
MA by virtue of being a don,

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:56.260
10 honorary degrees, a
MacArthur Fellowships,

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:00.150
and numerous awards
from all over the world.

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:01.235
He's an honorary member

00:01:01.235 --> 00:01:04.040
of the American Institute of Architects,

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.400
foreign member of the
Royal Swedish Academy

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:07.840
of Engineering Sciences,

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.100
Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts,

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.220
and honorary senior fellow of
the Design Futures Council.

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.320
He's lately led the redesign
of over 30 billion dollars

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.440
worth of facilities in 29 sectors

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:24.940
for radical energy and
resource efficiency.

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:28.557
He's been a visiting professor
at numerous universities.

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.210
He's briefed 19 heads of states.

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:36.960
The Wall Street Journal named Mr. Lovins

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.010
one of 39 people worldwide
most likely to change

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:43.320
the course of business in the '90s.

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.279
And Newsweek praised him as
one of the western world's

00:01:46.279 --> 00:01:50.208
most influential energy thinkers.

00:01:50.208 --> 00:01:53.095
Amory, welcome to Berkley.

00:01:53.095 --> 00:01:54.550
- Thanks for having me.

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:56.100
- Where were you born and raised?

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.040
- Washington D.C.

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:59.820
- And, go ahead, please.

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.260
- Lived just outside there
in Silver Spring, Maryland

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.210
for eight years and gradually
trickled up the coast,

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:07.360
went to high school in Amherst.

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.160
And then lived in Cambridge a few years,

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:10.968
then 14 years in England.

00:02:10.968 --> 00:02:13.251
- And looking back, how
do you think your parents

00:02:13.251 --> 00:02:15.470
shaped your thinking about the world?

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:16.873
- Profoundly.

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.810
My sister, Julie, is
a linguist, and I were

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.770
part of the adult conversation
from the beginning.

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:27.980
We were just small adults.

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:29.310
And there were a lot of interesting people

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:30.657
discussing the affairs of the day.

00:02:30.657 --> 00:02:33.480
And we were raised with the ideal

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.991
of helping make the world better.

00:02:35.991 --> 00:02:39.820
And given lots of choices.

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:42.910
So I read voraciously.

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:44.450
Being sick a lot in childhood,

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:46.910
I was home reading most of the time.

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:51.910
And ended up, I think,
much better equipped

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.060
than I would have been through
a conventional education.

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.163
I'm actually a Harvard and Oxford dropout.

00:03:00.124 --> 00:03:03.520
Harvard wanted me to specialize too much.

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:05.870
And Oxford wouldn't let me
do a doctorate in energy,

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:09.880
'cause it was two years
before the oil embargo of '73.

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:11.920
And they said, "Energy?

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:12.753
What's that?

00:03:12.753 --> 00:03:13.803
It's not an academic subject is it?

00:03:13.803 --> 00:03:15.170
We haven't a chair at it.

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:16.213
Pick a real subject."

00:03:16.213 --> 00:03:17.910
But I did it anyway.

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:19.430
They now have a chair in it.

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:22.730
- Yeah, and I'm gonna talk to
you about that in a minute.

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:24.140
Namely academic rigidity.

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:25.230
But I'm curious.

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:28.732
Was it that your reading was eclectic

00:03:28.732 --> 00:03:31.530
and crossed disciplines?

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:35.410
- Yeah, I mean, my formal
education, such as it was,

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:38.090
was largely in physical sciences.

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:40.280
But then I had a parallel track.

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:45.113
It went, chronologically,
music, classics, math,

00:03:45.113 --> 00:03:48.120
linguistics, some law, a little medicine,

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.040
a lot of mountain photography.

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.780
And then I started to diversify,

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:53.180
because, in our line of work,

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:56.028
you have to pick up a couple
of new disciplines a year.

00:03:56.028 --> 00:03:59.760
And I figured out pretty early

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.000
one of the great unwritten secrets.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.110
That there's hardly any subject that

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:07.330
a smart, motivated person can't learn

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:08.910
as much about in six months

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:11.380
as most people in the field know.

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:13.170
Not all, of course.

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:14.333
But most.

00:04:14.333 --> 00:04:18.010
Enough that you can rattle
around in other people's turf

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:20.400
and do some serious damage.

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:24.597
- And what is it that
is a key impetus here?

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:30.530
That is, namely, you
suddenly realized that

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:34.300
you need to know
something about some stuff

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:35.930
that you don't know anything about?

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:39.190
Or is it just one thing
leads you to another?

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:40.583
- One thing leads to another.

00:04:40.583 --> 00:04:43.750
All kinds of knowledge are useful.

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:46.370
There's still a lot of stuff which

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:50.070
I have a rapidly expanding
frontier of ignorance.

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:53.790
But, after a while, as
they say in linguistics,

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:55.599
everything reminds you of something.

00:04:55.599 --> 00:05:00.599
And I think the world has way
too many narrow specialists

00:05:01.661 --> 00:05:04.710
and not enough vision across boundaries.

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:08.910
So, many of our problems
are self-inflicted

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:12.220
by narrow vision trying
to do just one thing

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:14.748
and not understanding connections.

00:05:14.748 --> 00:05:19.748
Do you know our guiding
parable about parachuting cats?

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:21.320
- No, no, please.

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:24.580
- Well, it's an essentially true story.

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:26.900
I'm still nailing down some
details in the archives.

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:30.973
But, in the '50s, the
Dayak people in Borneo,

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:36.000
especially up in the Kelabit
Highlands, had malaria.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.070
The World Health
Organization had a solution.

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:39.943
They would spray DDT all
over, which they did.

00:05:39.943 --> 00:05:42.270
They killed the mosquitoes,
so the malaria declined.

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:43.720
So far, so good.

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:44.890
But there were side effects.

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:47.200
For example, the roofs of people's houses

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:49.010
started to fall down on their heads.

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:53.680
Because the DDT had also
killed tiny parasitic wasps

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:57.340
that had previously controlled
thatch-eating caterpillars.

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:00.780
So, the colonial government
addressed this problem

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:02.780
by giving people sheet metal roofs.

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:04.970
But then folks were driven
nuts by lack of sleep

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:08.880
because of the din of the tropical rain

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:10.072
on the tin roofs at night.

00:06:10.072 --> 00:06:13.250
Meanwhile, though, the DDT-poisoned bugs

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:16.440
were eaten by geckos,
which were eaten by cats.

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:18.930
And, as the DDT built
up in the food chain,

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:19.890
it killed the cats.

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:22.670
But, without the cats, the
rats flourished and multiplied.

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:25.250
And, soon, the World Health Organization

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:27.040
was threatened with potential outbreaks

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:28.730
of typhus and sylvatic plague,

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:30.810
which it, itself, would have created.

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:33.757
And therefore had to call up RAF Singapore

00:06:33.757 --> 00:06:37.890
and ask them to come
conduct Operation Cat Drop.

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:42.185
Parachuting large numbers
of live cats into Borneo.

00:06:42.185 --> 00:06:46.450
So, this nicely shows that,

00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:48.889
if you don't understand
how things are connected,

00:06:48.889 --> 00:06:52.950
quite often, the cause
of problems is solutions.

00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:55.400
Most of our problems are like that.

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:57.870
So, what we try to do at
Rocky Mountain Institute,

00:06:57.870 --> 00:06:59.460
and, really, in my life's work,

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:03.070
is to understand and
harness hidden connections

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:09.120
so that you can solve or,
better still, avoid a problem

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:10.700
in a way that solves or avoids

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:12.320
a lot of other problems, as well,

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:14.610
without making new ones
before somebody has to go

00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:15.850
parachuting more cats.

00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:20.850
- Yeah, and I think the thrust
of your analyses is that,

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:26.130
too often, we focus on the little problem

00:07:26.130 --> 00:07:27.440
that is part of a chain.

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:29.887
So, you're suddenly
presented with the problem

00:07:29.887 --> 00:07:32.580
"How do we fix the roofs
in the middle chain?"

00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:33.860
And you put the tin roofs in.

00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:35.900
And so, nothing is really solved.

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:40.780
- Yeah, you're just creating more problems

00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:42.500
or swapping one for another.

00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:44.764
Or making it somebody else's problem.

00:07:44.764 --> 00:07:49.764
- I see a lot, in your writing,
a kind of a holistic view,

00:07:49.790 --> 00:07:51.170
which you just mentioned.

00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:53.760
Is this a...

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:58.260
Are you at all interested
in human studies, basically?

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:00.523
I mean, does literature inform

00:08:00.523 --> 00:08:02.860
your sense of the whole at all?

00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:03.833
- Sure, yeah.

00:08:07.587 --> 00:08:12.587
I mean, in cultural, as in other affairs,

00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:15.270
I'm still wandering in the wilderness.

00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:18.880
But I do try to be broadly informed.

00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:20.820
And, if I didn't do that,

00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:22.780
I couldn't possibly be effective

00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:24.523
or try to do the right thing.

00:08:26.243 --> 00:08:29.140
- You talked a little
about your education,

00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:30.630
your disappointment with Harvard.

00:08:30.630 --> 00:08:31.680
You go to Oxford.

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:32.952
You're at Oxford.

00:08:32.952 --> 00:08:35.210
You want to do energy studies.

00:08:35.210 --> 00:08:36.953
At the time, it's '74...

00:08:38.579 --> 00:08:39.412
- [Amory] '71.

00:08:39.412 --> 00:08:41.900
- '71, '71.

00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:43.360
Talk a little about that time,

00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:46.925
'cause what was coming was the oil embargo

00:08:46.925 --> 00:08:49.000
by the Middle Eastern states.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:50.496
- In '73, yeah.

00:08:50.496 --> 00:08:51.658
- '73, right.

00:08:51.658 --> 00:08:56.156
And you wrote a very perceptive article,

00:08:56.156 --> 00:08:59.730
prophetic article, in Foreign Affairs.

00:08:59.730 --> 00:09:01.320
Talk a little about that.

00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:04.580
Yeah, well, in the late '60s,

00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:09.170
I'd been reading the writings
of John Holdren and others

00:09:09.170 --> 00:09:12.390
about the nexus, the tangle

00:09:12.390 --> 00:09:14.930
of population, environment,
resource development,

00:09:14.930 --> 00:09:16.560
security issues.

00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:18.900
Realizing we were headed
for serious trouble

00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:21.580
with things like climate change
and nuclear proliferation

00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:22.743
and oil dependence.

00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:25.322
And these were all interlinked.

00:09:25.322 --> 00:09:28.470
And it seemed, to me, obvious that energy

00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:31.500
was a kind of master key for unlocking

00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:32.640
many of these puzzles.

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:35.360
Or for learning how to deal with

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:37.403
other resource issues, like water.

00:09:40.101 --> 00:09:45.100
And, meanwhile, I was transferred
from Harvard to Oxford

00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:50.010
so the administrators
would get out of my hair.

00:09:50.010 --> 00:09:51.283
I had some in those days.

00:09:52.820 --> 00:09:55.450
- We still have the administrators.

00:09:55.450 --> 00:09:56.533
- I had hair, too.

00:09:57.890 --> 00:09:59.233
In '67.

00:10:00.931 --> 00:10:04.590
And, initially, as a grad student

00:10:04.590 --> 00:10:06.440
at Magdalen College, Oxford,

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:09.460
just through a series of
coincidences of whom I knew

00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:10.990
that could help me get in.

00:10:10.990 --> 00:10:12.050
And that was great.

00:10:12.050 --> 00:10:14.620
And then I was running out of money again.

00:10:14.620 --> 00:10:17.870
And my squash partner, Sudhera Naan,

00:10:17.870 --> 00:10:20.710
said "Well, I've got
this nice thing at Murton

00:10:20.710 --> 00:10:22.374
called a senior scholarship
that's expiring.

00:10:22.374 --> 00:10:24.490
So, they'll advertise it again.

00:10:24.490 --> 00:10:25.420
Why don't you apply?

00:10:25.420 --> 00:10:28.200
It pays your expenses and a stipend."

00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:29.290
So, I did.

00:10:29.290 --> 00:10:31.450
And, halfway through the
short list interview,

00:10:31.450 --> 00:10:32.730
discovered I was being interviewed

00:10:32.730 --> 00:10:33.840
for a much more exalted thing

00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:35.270
called junior research fellowship,

00:10:35.270 --> 00:10:36.970
which I'd gotten and became a don.

00:10:39.310 --> 00:10:40.960
And, initially, in Magdeline,

00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:43.280
I'd been doing theoretical physics,

00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:45.490
but I wasn't really a theoretician.

00:10:45.490 --> 00:10:47.650
And then I was trying to
switch into biophysics.

00:10:47.650 --> 00:10:50.660
And then realizing the old
Stokely Carmichael line that,

00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:51.710
if you're not part of the solution,

00:10:51.710 --> 00:10:53.240
you're part of the problem.

00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:56.340
And the academic work I was doing

00:10:56.340 --> 00:10:58.630
was intellectually fascinating,

00:10:58.630 --> 00:11:01.883
but not terribly important.

00:11:02.789 --> 00:11:06.800
So, I wanted to make more of a difference.

00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:10.570
And, meanwhile, fell in with David Brower,

00:11:10.570 --> 00:11:13.781
the greatest conservationist
of the 20th century through,

00:11:13.781 --> 00:11:16.040
of all things, mountain photography.

00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:17.631
Which I'd been doing in North Wales

00:11:17.631 --> 00:11:19.900
with Philip Pell Evans,

00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:23.923
the unsung great British
landscape photographer.

00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:29.380
And we ended up together doing

00:11:29.380 --> 00:11:31.290
one of Dave's exhibit format books

00:11:31.290 --> 00:11:33.288
on the mountains of North Wales.

00:11:33.288 --> 00:11:35.310
That got me involved with him.

00:11:35.310 --> 00:11:40.170
So, when Oxford didn't recognize energy

00:11:40.170 --> 00:11:42.440
as an academic subject

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.990
and I couldn't find a way
to do a doctorate in that...

00:11:47.990 --> 00:11:52.990
I resigned in '71 partway
through the fellowship

00:11:53.770 --> 00:11:57.690
and went to work for
Dave as his British rep

00:11:57.690 --> 00:11:59.400
initially for, I thought, a year or two.

00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:01.870
It turned out to be 10 years in London.

00:12:01.870 --> 00:12:04.565
Although he had, meanwhile,
left Friends of the Earth.

00:12:04.565 --> 00:12:07.660
And so, I was living by my wits in London

00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:10.470
cross-pollinating the energy
grapevine across the Atlantic.

00:12:10.470 --> 00:12:14.640
Because, at that time,
the technology leadership

00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:15.780
was more in the US.

00:12:15.780 --> 00:12:17.393
Policy more in Europe.

00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:21.023
They needed to talk to each other more.

00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:23.730
And, meanwhile, I'd come back

00:12:23.730 --> 00:12:25.519
and got in the White
Mountains every summer.

00:12:25.519 --> 00:12:27.197
It worked quite well.

00:12:27.197 --> 00:12:30.940
And then, eventually, my
then wife Hunter and I...

00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:32.447
We had married in '79.

00:12:33.391 --> 00:12:36.045
Moved back in '81.

00:12:36.045 --> 00:12:39.090
And, within a year,

00:12:39.090 --> 00:12:41.740
we'd found some land
to build on in Colorado

00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:43.580
and gather a handful of colleagues.

00:12:43.580 --> 00:12:45.880
Which soon got out of hand.

00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:47.750
We now have about 100.

00:12:47.750 --> 00:12:49.720
She left in 2002.

00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:53.440
And Rocky Mountain Institute
is now 26 years old

00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:56.042
and making a difference.

00:12:56.042 --> 00:12:59.700
- And so, what was the
reception of this article

00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:01.048
that you wrote for Foreign Affairs?

00:13:01.048 --> 00:13:06.048
- That article actually
came out of some concepts

00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:10.543
that first took shape on a roll
out shale blackboard in '75.

00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:14.183
They'd called me in around '73

00:13:15.931 --> 00:13:17.870
at the time of the oil embargo.

00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:20.940
Dennis Gabor, the inventor of holography,

00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:22.950
said they should talk to me.

00:13:22.950 --> 00:13:25.950
And we got along well.

00:13:25.950 --> 00:13:27.840
They had, at that time,

00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:31.040
the best strategic planning
capability in the world.

00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:33.760
So, I found their planning methodology

00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:38.513
that Piervoka developed very
valuable and educational.

00:13:40.810 --> 00:13:42.470
And I had some unusual ideas.

00:13:42.470 --> 00:13:44.370
I'd already, by the time of the embargo,

00:13:44.370 --> 00:13:45.430
written a book on energy.

00:13:45.430 --> 00:13:47.180
So, I had a little headstart.

00:13:47.180 --> 00:13:52.180
And was gradually realizing,
through the early '70s,

00:13:52.620 --> 00:13:54.720
that the whole problem had been misdefined

00:13:55.555 --> 00:13:57.760
as where do we get more energy?

00:13:57.760 --> 00:14:01.140
More of any kind from
any source at any price.

00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:02.946
But people don't actually want

00:14:02.946 --> 00:14:06.040
barrels of sticky black
goo or lumps of coal

00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:07.250
or raw kilowatt hours.

00:14:07.250 --> 00:14:10.040
They want the services
the energy provides.

00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:13.623
Like hot showers, cold
beer, mobility, comfort.

00:14:14.827 --> 00:14:16.460
And it seemed to make more sense

00:14:16.460 --> 00:14:18.710
to start at that end of
the problem by asking

00:14:18.710 --> 00:14:23.040
what end uses do we want the energy for

00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:26.750
and how much energy of
what kind or quality

00:14:26.750 --> 00:14:28.980
at what scale from what
source will do that job

00:14:28.980 --> 00:14:29.813
in the cheapest way?

00:14:29.813 --> 00:14:34.760
So, this end use leased cost question

00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:36.700
turned out to be a very fruitful way

00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:39.300
to look at energy and
a lot of other things.

00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:43.570
And, indeed, in '75, '76,

00:14:43.570 --> 00:14:45.970
I wrote this article that
ended up in Foreign Affairs.

00:14:45.970 --> 00:14:49.330
And then a book a year
later, Soft Energy Paths.

00:14:49.330 --> 00:14:53.840
And it stills reads pretty well.

00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:56.280
It laid out what happens,

00:14:56.280 --> 00:14:59.280
what answer do you get if you
ask that different question.

00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:03.580
And you end up using energy
far more productively.

00:15:03.580 --> 00:15:05.260
We've already more than doubled

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:09.071
our energy efficiency
since '75 at a big profit.

00:15:09.071 --> 00:15:11.630
And you end up shifting supply

00:15:11.630 --> 00:15:14.920
to more diverse, dispersed,
renewable sources

00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:17.513
that provide the right kind for the job.

00:15:18.710 --> 00:15:21.980
And that revolution is
now well underway, too.

00:15:21.980 --> 00:15:25.320
It was delayed by policy
meddling for 20 odd years.

00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:28.522
But, finally, it's
happening in the market.

00:15:28.522 --> 00:15:32.860
In fact, the developments
are really revolutionary.

00:15:32.860 --> 00:15:36.346
And very few people realize the
revolution already happened.

00:15:36.346 --> 00:15:37.872
- I'm curious.

00:15:37.872 --> 00:15:41.563
We'll talk about the Rocky
Mountain Institute in a moment.

00:15:42.871 --> 00:15:46.950
Because I think that
organization is really critical

00:15:46.950 --> 00:15:48.921
to the way you view the
problems of the world.

00:15:48.921 --> 00:15:51.090
But I'm curious.

00:15:51.090 --> 00:15:54.450
Students might be interested
in classifying you.

00:15:54.450 --> 00:15:58.640
You're a consultant, a physical
scientist, an engineer.

00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:00.535
And what does it take...

00:16:00.535 --> 00:16:02.010
You can answer that.

00:16:02.010 --> 00:16:03.948
- Recovering physicist.

00:16:03.948 --> 00:16:07.690
- But what I am curious
is what are the skills

00:16:07.690 --> 00:16:09.810
do you see that are really important

00:16:09.810 --> 00:16:14.423
for doing the kind of out of
the box thinking that you do?

00:16:15.510 --> 00:16:19.750
- The same ones that I
look for in people I hire.

00:16:19.750 --> 00:16:23.723
I want people who are literate, numerate,

00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:28.503
self-starting or self-propelled,

00:16:29.830 --> 00:16:34.830
fun, intensely curious, have
a vision across boundaries,

00:16:34.970 --> 00:16:36.620
are passionate about our mission,

00:16:36.620 --> 00:16:39.053
and have a high tolerance of ambiguity.

00:16:40.250 --> 00:16:43.910
- So, quite a number of skills.

00:16:43.910 --> 00:16:47.150
But necessary if you're
gonna think out of the box.

00:16:47.150 --> 00:16:49.493
- Yeah, and realize there is no box.

00:16:51.018 --> 00:16:53.910
So, I don't hire by discipline.

00:16:53.910 --> 00:16:55.150
I hire by aptitude.

00:16:55.150 --> 00:16:57.599
I look for all around athletes.

00:16:57.599 --> 00:17:02.599
- And so, frustrated
at Harvard and Oxford,

00:17:05.060 --> 00:17:06.850
you moved to the US.

00:17:06.850 --> 00:17:09.280
You start this institute.

00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:13.493
What did you see that
institute being able to do

00:17:13.493 --> 00:17:17.660
that you couldn't do in
these other settings?

00:17:17.660 --> 00:17:19.810
- My then wife Hunter and I thought

00:17:22.350 --> 00:17:24.780
we could be more effective
with a handful of colleagues

00:17:24.780 --> 00:17:26.150
than just mom and pop.

00:17:26.150 --> 00:17:29.140
And Dave Brower was gradually getting into

00:17:29.140 --> 00:17:30.420
an untenable position with

00:17:30.420 --> 00:17:32.735
his board at Friends of the Earth,

00:17:32.735 --> 00:17:34.585
as he had earlier at the Sierra Club.

00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:38.200
He used to say, "If
you're an environmentalist

00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:41.440
and have a balance in your bank account,

00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:43.729
it means you haven't realized
the urgency of the situation."

00:17:43.729 --> 00:17:45.260
(laughter)

00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:47.480
So, it was obvious he was
going to be forced out

00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:48.680
and probably we would, too.

00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:49.727
So, we started to think

00:17:49.727 --> 00:17:54.310
"What sort of institutional
home could we devise?"

00:17:54.310 --> 00:17:58.720
There weren't, at the time,
companies or government agencies

00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:02.460
or other groups that we
found very attractive.

00:18:02.460 --> 00:18:05.390
And, eventually, we
came up with the notion

00:18:05.390 --> 00:18:07.020
of starting our own.

00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:10.284
Which we did with $10,000
out of our back pocket.

00:18:10.284 --> 00:18:11.923
Just grew it from there.

00:18:13.254 --> 00:18:18.254
And, you know, I said, "Oh,
horrors administrivia."

00:18:18.900 --> 00:18:19.860
And Hunter said, "Don't worry.

00:18:19.860 --> 00:18:21.020
I've been running TreePeople

00:18:21.020 --> 00:18:22.580
for Andy Lipkis for some years.

00:18:22.580 --> 00:18:24.190
So, I know how to do that.

00:18:24.190 --> 00:18:25.980
You just get the ideas

00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:28.170
and do the research and quality control."

00:18:28.170 --> 00:18:30.250
So, that worked for a long time.

00:18:30.250 --> 00:18:34.050
And, gradually, we became
more institutional.

00:18:34.050 --> 00:18:37.550
And now fully so, because, in March '07,

00:18:37.550 --> 00:18:40.210
we finally got a real CEO, Michael Potts,

00:18:40.210 --> 00:18:41.810
who's a tech entrepreneur.

00:18:41.810 --> 00:18:43.882
So, I was then able, belatedly,

00:18:43.882 --> 00:18:46.220
to move up to chairman of chief sciences.

00:18:46.220 --> 00:18:51.220
So, I can just do mission,
stewardship, and evolution,

00:18:51.670 --> 00:18:54.433
thought leadership, special projects,

00:18:55.290 --> 00:18:59.043
cultural transmission, and
mentoring strategic influence.

00:19:00.750 --> 00:19:03.130
Rainmaking, rolodex, all of the stuff

00:19:03.130 --> 00:19:06.210
that goes with being elder,

00:19:06.210 --> 00:19:07.949
although not yet venerable.

00:19:07.949 --> 00:19:09.195
(laughter)

00:19:09.195 --> 00:19:11.810
- And, if you had to give
a short mission statement

00:19:11.810 --> 00:19:13.970
for your institute, what is it?

00:19:13.970 --> 00:19:16.510
- We're actually in the
process of rewording it.

00:19:16.510 --> 00:19:18.880
But it's currently to foster the efficient

00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:21.551
and restorative use of resources

00:19:21.551 --> 00:19:24.660
to make the world
secure, just, prosperous,

00:19:24.660 --> 00:19:26.090
and life sustaining.

00:19:26.090 --> 00:19:27.460
I won't give you a sneak preview

00:19:27.460 --> 00:19:28.480
of what we're coming up with,

00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:31.790
which, I think, is even niftier
but says the same thing.

00:19:31.790 --> 00:19:34.733
The short version is we
create abundance by design.

00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:41.680
- And so, the question becomes,

00:19:44.150 --> 00:19:47.820
obviously, you think ideas matter.

00:19:47.820 --> 00:19:52.820
And so, how do you make
them effective in the world?

00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:03.560
- We implement our ideas
largely in mindful markets

00:20:06.590 --> 00:20:11.590
by an unusual variety of techniques.

00:20:14.370 --> 00:20:17.840
Things like institutional acupuncture.

00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:19.750
We figure out where the business logic

00:20:19.750 --> 00:20:22.210
and what ought to happen is congested

00:20:22.210 --> 00:20:23.400
and not flowing properly.

00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:25.790
We stick needles in
carefully selected sites

00:20:25.790 --> 00:20:27.280
to get it flowing.

00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:28.563
This works very well.

00:20:30.350 --> 00:20:33.200
We have pretty good convening power,

00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:35.720
because we're fiercely independent.

00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:39.000
Known for saying, honestly,
exactly what we think

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:41.640
and backing it up with good scholarship.

00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:46.640
So, we're widely regarded
in industry and military

00:20:48.060 --> 00:20:49.360
and can pull together people that

00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:53.053
need to talk to each other
as kind of an honest broker.

00:20:54.370 --> 00:20:59.370
We use an architectural charrette process,

00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:03.220
which is an intensive round table,

00:21:03.220 --> 00:21:05.320
transdiciplinary design workshop

00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:06.590
with very ambitious deliverables.

00:21:06.590 --> 00:21:08.220
So we've applied that to redesigning

00:21:08.220 --> 00:21:11.360
hundreds of buildings,
industries, vehicles.

00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:12.193
You name it.

00:21:12.193 --> 00:21:13.578
Just about anything.

00:21:13.578 --> 00:21:17.420
And we have, really, a
quite extensive toolkit.

00:21:17.420 --> 00:21:20.430
We don't try to take our work to scale

00:21:20.430 --> 00:21:24.935
by turning into a huge
consulting firm or whatever.

00:21:24.935 --> 00:21:28.380
We try to ally with powerful partners

00:21:28.380 --> 00:21:33.380
who already have those
capabilities and need our content.

00:21:33.470 --> 00:21:36.617
Which we're happy to have
them brand and spread.

00:21:36.617 --> 00:21:41.617
And we've evolved a rather
unusual hybrid mechanism

00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:45.559
as an entrepreneurial
nonprofit that's had,

00:21:45.559 --> 00:21:48.950
in 26 years, 11 different revenue models.

00:21:48.950 --> 00:21:50.150
10 of them entrepreneurial.

00:21:50.150 --> 00:21:50.983
And they've all worked.

00:21:50.983 --> 00:21:52.660
Most of them are still going on.

00:21:52.660 --> 00:21:55.650
Including five for-profit spinoffs.

00:21:55.650 --> 00:21:59.240
So, much of our revenue
actually comes from

00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:02.670
private sector consultancy
to carry out our mission.

00:22:02.670 --> 00:22:04.560
This creates very rapid learning

00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:07.193
with a smart, highly motivated partner.

00:22:08.700 --> 00:22:12.650
It creates, also, teachable case studies

00:22:12.650 --> 00:22:14.870
and competitive pressure for emulation.

00:22:14.870 --> 00:22:17.050
That is, we help early adopters

00:22:17.050 --> 00:22:19.660
get so conspicuously successful

00:22:19.660 --> 00:22:22.640
with resource efficiency
and natural capitalism

00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:25.510
that their rivals are forced
by competitive pressure

00:22:25.510 --> 00:22:28.243
to follow suit or lose market share.

00:22:28.243 --> 00:22:32.240
- You told the Manchester Guardian...

00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:34.987
It was a snappy quote in
a list of snappy quotes.

00:22:34.987 --> 00:22:36.780
"I'm not an environmentalist.

00:22:36.780 --> 00:22:40.565
I'm a cultural repairman."

00:22:40.565 --> 00:22:44.656
Was that just a zinger for the moment?

00:22:44.656 --> 00:22:46.703
But it sounds like it's true.

00:22:46.703 --> 00:22:48.010
Explain that.

00:22:48.010 --> 00:22:49.210
Explain what that means.

00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:52.813
- We're trying to help things work better.

00:22:53.940 --> 00:22:57.830
And RMI is not an environmental group.

00:22:57.830 --> 00:23:02.830
It's a think and do tank that
advances resource efficiency.

00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:11.400
Because that turns scarcity into abundance

00:23:11.461 --> 00:23:16.380
and relieves a lot of the basic problems

00:23:16.380 --> 00:23:20.500
of environment, development,
security, and prosperity

00:23:20.500 --> 00:23:23.470
simultaneously without compromise.

00:23:23.470 --> 00:23:27.380
So, we think it's not
exactly a magic elixir,

00:23:27.380 --> 00:23:28.490
but pretty close.

00:23:28.490 --> 00:23:30.200
It solves lots of problems at once

00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:31.766
and doesn't make more.

00:23:31.766 --> 00:23:36.670
- You, in acting in the world,
so to speak, with ideas,

00:23:36.670 --> 00:23:40.838
you had a choice and you
identify that choice.

00:23:40.838 --> 00:23:42.300
You work with business.

00:23:42.300 --> 00:23:43.830
You work with government.

00:23:43.830 --> 00:23:45.910
You work with the environmental movement.

00:23:45.910 --> 00:23:47.410
I'm sure you work with all of them.

00:23:47.410 --> 00:23:48.520
- [Amory] We work with everybody.

00:23:48.520 --> 00:23:52.580
- But your main focus has been

00:23:53.876 --> 00:23:56.205
with consulting with business.

00:23:56.205 --> 00:23:58.530
And why was that?

00:23:58.530 --> 00:24:02.520
Did you see the
possibilities for doing this

00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:04.650
cultural repair work?

00:24:04.650 --> 00:24:07.483
That that was a better
environment to do this?

00:24:08.929 --> 00:24:11.300
- Working with business has been

00:24:11.300 --> 00:24:13.290
a main focus for 35 years.

00:24:13.290 --> 00:24:16.140
Because it was clear, even then,

00:24:16.140 --> 00:24:18.560
that, in the evolving tripolar world,

00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:21.590
where the foci of power and action

00:24:21.590 --> 00:24:26.590
are in the private sector,
civil society, and government

00:24:27.420 --> 00:24:28.853
all interacting,

00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:32.450
government, at least at a national level,

00:24:32.450 --> 00:24:34.980
is typically the least effective of those.

00:24:34.980 --> 00:24:36.670
And, in our country particularly,

00:24:36.670 --> 00:24:40.650
it's been dreadfully
gridlocked for a long time.

00:24:40.650 --> 00:24:44.213
And the process of forming
its policy is pretty corrupt.

00:24:45.190 --> 00:24:48.500
So, why not work with the
more effective sectors?

00:24:48.500 --> 00:24:49.790
Particularly business

00:24:49.790 --> 00:24:53.363
and its co-evolution with civil society.

00:24:53.363 --> 00:24:58.363
Which could be anywhere from
cooperative to adversarial.

00:25:00.931 --> 00:25:04.890
They form a tight ecosystem.

00:25:04.890 --> 00:25:09.890
And we found business is, in general,

00:25:10.130 --> 00:25:12.170
extraordinarily dynamic.

00:25:12.170 --> 00:25:16.463
It has, of course, its
own hangups and inertias,

00:25:16.463 --> 00:25:18.160
like every institution.

00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:20.750
But there is a lot of leadership,

00:25:20.750 --> 00:25:23.160
top-down, bottom-up, every which way,

00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:25.750
that can be harnessed in business

00:25:25.750 --> 00:25:28.374
to do extraordinary things quickly.

00:25:28.374 --> 00:25:30.370
Other than perhaps the military,

00:25:30.370 --> 00:25:34.013
it's about the only really
effective institution we have

00:25:34.013 --> 00:25:37.083
that can do big, difficult things quickly.

00:25:38.370 --> 00:25:43.070
- It's interesting that,
in your life's work,

00:25:43.070 --> 00:25:44.800
you've often...

00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:47.090
And I wanna be careful with my terms here.

00:25:47.090 --> 00:25:48.030
And you can jump on me.

00:25:48.030 --> 00:25:53.030
But it's as if you were
perceived as a Cassandra

00:25:53.090 --> 00:25:55.700
when, in fact, you were
a prophet, basically.

00:25:55.700 --> 00:26:00.700
And I think that it's fascinating that

00:26:01.977 --> 00:26:06.977
you identified a vehicle whereby
you can make things happen.

00:26:10.189 --> 00:26:14.380
But many people argue that,

00:26:14.380 --> 00:26:16.320
when we're looking at the
environmental problems,

00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:19.670
that capitalism is part of the
problem and not the solution.

00:26:19.670 --> 00:26:22.428
But what you're really saying is that

00:26:22.428 --> 00:26:24.390
you can start at the micro...

00:26:24.390 --> 00:26:25.860
You have to have the right theory

00:26:25.860 --> 00:26:30.270
and the right way to think
about engineering processes

00:26:30.270 --> 00:26:32.260
and changing those processes.

00:26:32.260 --> 00:26:36.130
But that you can work at
the level of the firm,

00:26:36.130 --> 00:26:38.180
but, through the market,

00:26:38.180 --> 00:26:40.863
there will be imitation and competition

00:26:40.863 --> 00:26:43.760
which will force a general adoption.

00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:45.909
Is that a fair statement
of the way you see it?

00:26:45.909 --> 00:26:47.170
- Pretty close.

00:26:47.170 --> 00:26:51.500
I mean, I'm certainly not
a market fundamentalist.

00:26:51.500 --> 00:26:55.300
I don't think markets
can solve all problems.

00:26:55.300 --> 00:26:59.340
Markets make a splendid
servant, a bad master,

00:26:59.340 --> 00:27:01.310
and a worse religion.

00:27:01.310 --> 00:27:03.970
And, if you try to substitute markets

00:27:03.970 --> 00:27:08.583
for ethics, politics, faith,
you get in serious trouble.

00:27:09.750 --> 00:27:11.988
I think our country's just starting

00:27:11.988 --> 00:27:15.593
to reverse that pendulum swing.

00:27:17.220 --> 00:27:21.010
But business is very good at what it does.

00:27:21.010 --> 00:27:23.040
Markets are very good at what they do.

00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:24.920
We've invented probably 20 ways

00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:27.693
to make markets and save
resources, for example.

00:27:29.420 --> 00:27:30.550
Really simple ideas.

00:27:30.550 --> 00:27:33.810
Like, in New England,
you can bid megawatts,

00:27:33.810 --> 00:27:36.670
saved electricity, into
the supply auction.

00:27:36.670 --> 00:27:37.570
And, of course, you win,

00:27:37.570 --> 00:27:38.847
because efficiency's cheaper

00:27:38.847 --> 00:27:41.410
than producing more electricity.

00:27:41.410 --> 00:27:42.540
Then you get the money up front

00:27:42.540 --> 00:27:45.260
with which to do the savings
and you have money left over.

00:27:45.260 --> 00:27:47.483
And everybody saves money and emissions.

00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:54.360
The toolkit we've evolved is very much,

00:27:55.338 --> 00:27:59.090
but not exclusively, led
by business for profit.

00:27:59.090 --> 00:28:01.850
We've also devised a lot of
innovative public policies

00:28:01.850 --> 00:28:05.140
to help support and not
distort the business logic.

00:28:05.140 --> 00:28:06.960
I think government has
a very important role,

00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:08.423
but it should steer, not row.

00:28:09.573 --> 00:28:11.850
I'd like it to steer
in the right direction.

00:28:11.850 --> 00:28:14.040
But then I work mainly with the rowers

00:28:14.040 --> 00:28:15.710
to improve their technique.

00:28:15.710 --> 00:28:19.170
For example, we've figured
out and now demonstrated

00:28:19.170 --> 00:28:23.300
in 29 sectors how to get
expanding, not diminishing, returns

00:28:23.300 --> 00:28:25.900
to investments in energy
and resource savings.

00:28:25.900 --> 00:28:29.640
That is, how to make very big savings,

00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:34.640
even factor 10 savings, cheaper
than small or no savings.

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:36.190
Cheaper up front.

00:28:36.190 --> 00:28:38.233
Which always surprises the economists.

00:28:42.494 --> 00:28:44.579
If you look at your career,

00:28:44.579 --> 00:28:49.579
it's very clear that your analysis,

00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:53.370
your theorizing, really
gives one a long term view.

00:28:53.370 --> 00:28:57.110
And, often, the current situation

00:28:57.110 --> 00:28:59.880
is not ready for the long term view.

00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:01.540
So, it's kind of interesting.

00:29:01.540 --> 00:29:03.620
Has that been frustrating?

00:29:03.620 --> 00:29:08.430
The extent to which it really takes time.

00:29:08.430 --> 00:29:11.720
I'm not talking about
the particular redesign

00:29:11.720 --> 00:29:13.220
of a particular company.

00:29:13.220 --> 00:29:16.250
But, rather, the long
term vision that you have

00:29:16.250 --> 00:29:17.940
and which you call natural capitalism,

00:29:17.940 --> 00:29:19.160
which we'll talk about in a minute.

00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:23.410
- Well, the changes
that my colleagues and I

00:29:23.410 --> 00:29:26.440
are trying to make take,
typically, a half century or so

00:29:26.440 --> 00:29:28.210
to come to full flower.

00:29:28.210 --> 00:29:31.987
And this requires relentless patience

00:29:31.987 --> 00:29:35.200
and meticulous attention to detail.

00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:38.089
But you see a lot of progress every day.

00:29:38.089 --> 00:29:41.213
Which is, of course, encouraging.

00:29:43.070 --> 00:29:48.070
And we don't set abstract, long term goals

00:29:49.950 --> 00:29:53.623
that don't have short
term practical steps.

00:29:55.930 --> 00:29:58.530
That is, we're intently focused on

00:29:58.530 --> 00:29:59.900
how to get there from here.

00:29:59.900 --> 00:30:02.560
Not just this far off vision,

00:30:02.560 --> 00:30:05.223
'cause we work in a
spirit of applied hope.

00:30:06.220 --> 00:30:08.990
Which is not the same as theoretical hope

00:30:08.990 --> 00:30:11.913
and not the same as
mere glandular optimism.

00:30:13.680 --> 00:30:18.680
- Let's talk about your
vision in natural capitalism.

00:30:22.067 --> 00:30:23.652
Let me show the book.

00:30:23.652 --> 00:30:28.652
And we will also direct people
to your website shortly.

00:30:33.490 --> 00:30:35.030
Help us understand.

00:30:35.030 --> 00:30:37.800
Let's walk through some of the arguments.

00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:40.811
I think you start with the notion that

00:30:40.811 --> 00:30:45.811
where capitalism has failed
and needs to be redirected

00:30:46.640 --> 00:30:50.260
is really in the valuation that

00:30:50.260 --> 00:30:53.480
it places on natural capital.

00:30:53.480 --> 00:30:54.800
Tell us what you mean by that.

00:30:54.800 --> 00:30:57.716
- Capitalism, in a way,
has succeeded all too well

00:30:57.716 --> 00:31:01.580
in half of its task.

00:31:01.580 --> 00:31:03.870
Capitalism is conventionally defined as

00:31:03.870 --> 00:31:08.870
the productive use of and
reinvestment in capital.

00:31:09.700 --> 00:31:10.883
But what's capital?

00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:14.640
Industrial capitalism,
as we have known it,

00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:16.670
productively uses and reinvests in

00:31:16.670 --> 00:31:19.180
only physical and financial capital.

00:31:19.180 --> 00:31:21.210
That is money and goods.

00:31:21.210 --> 00:31:23.810
But it ignores and often liquidates

00:31:23.810 --> 00:31:26.220
two even more important kinds.

00:31:26.220 --> 00:31:27.950
Namely people and nature.

00:31:27.950 --> 00:31:30.500
Human capital and natural capital.

00:31:30.500 --> 00:31:32.910
Without people, there's no economy.

00:31:32.910 --> 00:31:34.630
Without nature, there are no people.

00:31:34.630 --> 00:31:36.453
This is a rather material omission.

00:31:38.090 --> 00:31:40.610
But it turns out, if you productively use

00:31:40.610 --> 00:31:43.460
and reinvest in all four forms of capital,

00:31:43.460 --> 00:31:45.270
if you play with a full deck,

00:31:45.270 --> 00:31:49.080
you make more money, have
more fun, and do more good.

00:31:49.080 --> 00:31:54.080
So, natural capitalism, which
Hunter and I formulated with

00:31:54.654 --> 00:31:57.113
our senior author, Paul Hawkin,

00:31:58.320 --> 00:32:01.160
is a new way of doing business

00:32:01.160 --> 00:32:04.210
as if nature and people
were properly valued,

00:32:04.210 --> 00:32:06.810
but without needing to
know or signal their value.

00:32:06.810 --> 00:32:09.923
It's not about internalizing
environmental costs.

00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:15.863
But it has four operational elements.

00:32:15.863 --> 00:32:20.230
The first is radical resource efficiency.

00:32:20.230 --> 00:32:22.710
Wringing lots more work out of

00:32:22.710 --> 00:32:25.130
the energy, minerals, water, topsoil,

00:32:25.130 --> 00:32:27.750
everything we borrow from the planet.

00:32:27.750 --> 00:32:30.940
Second, making things the way nature does

00:32:30.940 --> 00:32:34.660
with closed loops, no
waste, and no toxicity.

00:32:34.660 --> 00:32:36.790
Third, adopting a business model

00:32:36.790 --> 00:32:38.960
that rewards those two shifts.

00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:41.670
By rewarding both producers and customers

00:32:41.670 --> 00:32:42.730
for the same thing.

00:32:42.730 --> 00:32:45.820
Namely doing more and
better with less for longer.

00:32:45.820 --> 00:32:49.160
And, fourth, you reinvest
some of the resulting profits

00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:52.060
back into the kinds of
capital you're shortest of.

00:32:52.060 --> 00:32:53.770
Particularly nature.

00:32:53.770 --> 00:32:56.480
Together, those interlocking principles

00:32:56.480 --> 00:32:59.607
turn out to confer a stunning
competitive advantage

00:32:59.607 --> 00:33:04.607
and help, of course,
attract, retain, and motivate

00:33:04.820 --> 00:33:05.690
the best people,

00:33:05.690 --> 00:33:10.690
which is what business
competition is, at root, about.

00:33:11.060 --> 00:33:15.660
And this is really not
a novel set of ideas.

00:33:15.660 --> 00:33:19.690
It rests on very orthodox
economic concepts

00:33:19.690 --> 00:33:21.243
and historical experience.

00:33:23.480 --> 00:33:24.620
If you go back to the roots

00:33:24.620 --> 00:33:26.740
of the First Industrial Revolution

00:33:26.740 --> 00:33:28.763
in the 18th century in England,

00:33:30.090 --> 00:33:31.410
just to oversimplify a bit,

00:33:31.410 --> 00:33:34.070
there weren't enough
weavers to make enough cloth

00:33:34.070 --> 00:33:36.000
for most people to afford.

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:39.117
But, if you'd come into
Parliament around 1750 and said,

00:33:39.117 --> 00:33:40.920
"Don't worry. I know how
to solve this problem.

00:33:40.920 --> 00:33:43.880
We'll just make weavers
100 times more productive."

00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:46.130
Nobody would have understood this concept.

00:33:46.130 --> 00:33:48.310
Let alone thought it was possible.

00:33:48.310 --> 00:33:49.580
But it's what happened.

00:33:49.580 --> 00:33:54.580
And, soon, as technological
innovators teamed up

00:33:54.770 --> 00:33:56.800
with profit maximizing capitalists,

00:33:56.800 --> 00:34:01.020
you had a Lancashire spinner that

00:34:01.020 --> 00:34:02.140
could produce the cloth that

00:34:02.140 --> 00:34:05.160
previously had required a
couple of hundred weavers.

00:34:05.160 --> 00:34:08.270
So, we started spreading
this through the economy

00:34:08.270 --> 00:34:10.880
and soon you had affordable mass goods,

00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:12.267
purchasing power, middle class,

00:34:12.267 --> 00:34:15.420
and, ultimately, all the
artifacts we see around us

00:34:15.420 --> 00:34:19.680
as the hallmarks of an advanced
industrial civilization.

00:34:19.680 --> 00:34:24.233
Now, to summarize, then, the history,

00:34:26.470 --> 00:34:28.733
we hadn't enough...

00:34:28.733 --> 00:34:33.700
We had scarce people.

00:34:33.700 --> 00:34:35.010
Relative scarcity of people.

00:34:35.010 --> 00:34:38.920
Not enough people to exploit
seemingly boundless nature.

00:34:38.920 --> 00:34:41.893
So, we made people 100
times more productive.

00:34:42.750 --> 00:34:45.120
Well, now, the logic is the same,

00:34:45.120 --> 00:34:47.660
but the pattern of scarcity has reversed.

00:34:47.660 --> 00:34:50.890
We now have abundant
people and scarce nature.

00:34:50.890 --> 00:34:54.600
So, now, it's not people but
nature we need to be using

00:34:54.600 --> 00:34:57.610
four, 10, 100 times more productively.

00:34:57.610 --> 00:35:00.430
I think that's an idea
everybody can get behind.

00:35:00.430 --> 00:35:03.020
Particularly because it's very profitable.

00:35:03.020 --> 00:35:06.210
Efficiency's cheaper than
the resources it saves.

00:35:06.210 --> 00:35:10.120
Therefore, for example,
it's profitable, not costly,

00:35:10.120 --> 00:35:11.200
to protect the climate.

00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:13.150
Because efficiency's cheaper than fuel.

00:35:14.500 --> 00:35:17.500
- Let's look at a concrete example,

00:35:17.500 --> 00:35:19.030
because what you're...

00:35:19.030 --> 00:35:20.880
You have a very interesting example

00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:24.660
in both the book and the
article in the Harvard Review

00:35:24.660 --> 00:35:26.570
about a carpet maker.

00:35:26.570 --> 00:35:31.570
And, basically, it comes
down to rethinking design,

00:35:34.090 --> 00:35:36.974
rethinking our notion of a product,

00:35:36.974 --> 00:35:40.610
looking at not having a product,

00:35:40.610 --> 00:35:43.770
namely a carpet on your office floor,

00:35:43.770 --> 00:35:46.300
but the services that provide it.

00:35:46.300 --> 00:35:47.310
Talk about that.

00:35:47.310 --> 00:35:49.400
Because it's really...

00:35:49.400 --> 00:35:54.027
You're taken aback by how, if
you look at the whole picture,

00:35:54.027 --> 00:35:58.230
you really have to look
at the world in a new way.

00:35:58.230 --> 00:36:03.100
- Yeah, most offices are
still carpeted with broadloom.

00:36:03.100 --> 00:36:05.350
Big, wide rolls of stuff.

00:36:05.350 --> 00:36:09.350
And, every 10 or 20 years, it
starts to looks pretty awful.

00:36:09.350 --> 00:36:11.320
So, you have to shut down the office,

00:36:11.320 --> 00:36:15.384
move everybody out, roll
up the partly worn carpet,

00:36:15.384 --> 00:36:18.740
which is made of oil, send it to landfill,

00:36:18.740 --> 00:36:21.803
where it sits for 10 or 20,000 years,

00:36:21.803 --> 00:36:25.420
and lay down a new carpet, move back in,

00:36:25.420 --> 00:36:28.210
maybe get poisoned by the
fumes from the carpet glue.

00:36:28.210 --> 00:36:30.050
This is really pretty dumb
when you think about it,

00:36:30.050 --> 00:36:33.590
'cause you never wanted to own
a carpet in the first place.

00:36:33.590 --> 00:36:36.770
What you wanted was to
walk on it and look at it.

00:36:36.770 --> 00:36:40.630
So, Ray Anderson at Interface went beyond

00:36:40.630 --> 00:36:43.328
just the first principle
of natural capitalism,

00:36:43.328 --> 00:36:45.880
eliminating waste

00:36:45.880 --> 00:36:48.280
and wringing more work
out of his resources...

00:36:48.280 --> 00:36:49.310
He did pretty well with that.

00:36:49.310 --> 00:36:51.990
Hundreds of millions of
dollars extra profit already.

00:36:52.870 --> 00:36:54.633
- If he had different materials...

00:36:54.633 --> 00:36:56.590
- And, already, the company has

00:36:56.590 --> 00:36:59.410
cut its greenhouse gas emissions 82%

00:36:59.410 --> 00:37:00.600
while growing the business.

00:37:00.600 --> 00:37:02.940
It has the most oil
independent cost structure

00:37:02.940 --> 00:37:03.773
in the industry.

00:37:03.773 --> 00:37:05.520
It's doing really well with this approach.

00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:07.070
But he said, "Wait a minute.

00:37:07.070 --> 00:37:10.539
Let's invent a kind of carpet that

00:37:10.539 --> 00:37:14.970
has essentially no waste, no toxicity.

00:37:14.970 --> 00:37:18.143
You can remake it into itself
with no loss of quality.

00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:24.160
And it has good aesthetics
and acoustics and durability

00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:25.390
and so on.

00:37:25.390 --> 00:37:29.247
And takes a lot less energy
and material to make."

00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:35.360
But then he said, "Let's
deliver it as carpet tiles.

00:37:35.500 --> 00:37:37.770
Not as broadloom.

00:37:37.770 --> 00:37:41.290
And we could even do it
through a service lease.

00:37:41.290 --> 00:37:44.640
So, we lease you a floor covering service.

00:37:44.640 --> 00:37:47.450
And, every month little
elves come in the night

00:37:47.450 --> 00:37:50.090
and remove only the worn carpet tiles

00:37:50.090 --> 00:37:52.700
to be recycled into new ones."

00:37:52.700 --> 00:37:54.610
And they put down fresh ones.

00:37:54.610 --> 00:37:56.560
So, you have an always
fresh looking carpet.

00:37:56.560 --> 00:37:58.750
But there's no disruption
to your operation.

00:37:58.750 --> 00:38:00.560
And then you only need to replace

00:38:00.560 --> 00:38:02.340
about 1/5 of the carpet tiles,

00:38:02.340 --> 00:38:05.260
because the rest of them are
in places you're not walking.

00:38:05.260 --> 00:38:08.170
So, you save another factor of five

00:38:08.170 --> 00:38:10.530
on top of the factor 20 something

00:38:10.530 --> 00:38:15.170
from greater durability and
less materials intensity.

00:38:15.170 --> 00:38:19.750
And then, you've saved about 97-98%

00:38:21.780 --> 00:38:25.600
of the flow of stuff to
have a nice looking carpet.

00:38:25.600 --> 00:38:28.580
And, when you actually remanufacture it,

00:38:28.580 --> 00:38:32.850
you'd end up saving 99.9% or so.

00:38:32.850 --> 00:38:35.380
So, imagine that you're the
old kind of carpet maker

00:38:35.380 --> 00:38:37.119
and you're trying to
compete with this new kind.

00:38:37.119 --> 00:38:39.780
So, you're using 10 times more capital,

00:38:39.780 --> 00:38:42.297
1000 times more oil.

00:38:42.297 --> 00:38:46.520
And, by the way, your
competitor is leasing

00:38:46.520 --> 00:38:47.760
a floor covering service.

00:38:47.760 --> 00:38:50.040
That's a tax deductible
net operating lease.

00:38:50.040 --> 00:38:51.684
It's actually a financial product.

00:38:51.684 --> 00:38:54.850
Whereas, you're selling
square yards of carpet,

00:38:54.850 --> 00:38:58.850
which is an idle balance
sheet item doing you no good.

00:38:58.850 --> 00:39:01.680
It's pretty obvious who's
gonna win that competition.

00:39:01.680 --> 00:39:05.900
Now, in the event, there
was one technical problem.

00:39:05.900 --> 00:39:08.500
And there were some
institutional challenges

00:39:08.500 --> 00:39:11.199
with the marketing on the
particular product I described.

00:39:11.199 --> 00:39:13.527
But the concept is perfectly sound.

00:39:13.527 --> 00:39:17.100
And this so-called solutions
economy business model

00:39:17.100 --> 00:39:19.850
is taking over pretty quickly
in areas like chemicals

00:39:19.850 --> 00:39:23.860
where Dow, for example, instead
of selling you a solvent,

00:39:23.860 --> 00:39:26.580
leases you a dissolving service.

00:39:26.580 --> 00:39:30.130
So, the more trips they
can put the solvent through

00:39:30.130 --> 00:39:33.160
with different customers
and not lose much each time,

00:39:33.160 --> 00:39:36.130
the cheaper the dissolving
service becomes.

00:39:36.130 --> 00:39:36.963
Cheaper for you.

00:39:36.963 --> 00:39:37.796
Cheaper for them.

00:39:37.796 --> 00:39:39.750
More profitable for everybody.

00:39:39.750 --> 00:39:44.750
And the more elegant
frugality they can achieve

00:39:45.070 --> 00:39:47.040
in using the solvent molecules,

00:39:47.040 --> 00:39:48.563
the more money you both make.

00:39:49.800 --> 00:39:53.093
This is a very subtle and powerful concept

00:39:53.093 --> 00:39:58.093
to lease the service
people want from the good

00:39:59.650 --> 00:40:01.763
rather than selling the good.

00:40:03.290 --> 00:40:07.797
And it gets into areas as obvious as

00:40:08.760 --> 00:40:10.880
Schindler liking to lease you

00:40:10.880 --> 00:40:12.770
a vertical transportation service

00:40:12.770 --> 00:40:14.925
instead of selling you an elevator.

00:40:14.925 --> 00:40:16.720
Then the more durable and
efficient the elevator gets,

00:40:16.720 --> 00:40:18.910
the more money you both make.

00:40:18.910 --> 00:40:23.910
- Now, how do you envision this model

00:40:24.160 --> 00:40:25.540
changing the world?

00:40:25.540 --> 00:40:27.127
You just suggested that,

00:40:27.127 --> 00:40:29.540
when a competitor looks at

00:40:29.540 --> 00:40:31.189
what's going on in the other operation,

00:40:31.189 --> 00:40:33.590
they seem to have a losing proposition.

00:40:33.590 --> 00:40:34.423
Is it?

00:40:34.423 --> 00:40:35.256
- It's happening already.

00:40:35.256 --> 00:40:37.040
Look at the zip car/flex car model

00:40:37.040 --> 00:40:38.620
for personal mobility.

00:40:38.620 --> 00:40:41.210
Your car, your second
biggest household asset

00:40:41.210 --> 00:40:43.300
is parked 96% of the time.

00:40:43.300 --> 00:40:46.250
It just sits there eating
interest and parking fees.

00:40:46.250 --> 00:40:50.030
Well, if you arrange, instead,

00:40:50.030 --> 00:40:54.580
to have the car of your
choice available by the hour

00:40:54.580 --> 00:40:57.300
and then you leave it
at any convenient place

00:40:57.300 --> 00:40:59.130
or, in some countries,
they'll deliver it to you

00:40:59.130 --> 00:41:00.453
and pick it up afterwards,

00:41:01.440 --> 00:41:05.030
this means you can go have a four by

00:41:05.030 --> 00:41:06.407
to haul drywall on Wednesday

00:41:06.407 --> 00:41:09.100
and a sports car to pick
up your honey on Saturday.

00:41:09.100 --> 00:41:11.520
And you don't need to
own either one of them.

00:41:11.520 --> 00:41:13.970
And the business model
works for the provider,

00:41:13.970 --> 00:41:16.230
because there's diversity of need

00:41:16.230 --> 00:41:19.100
and very low asset
utilization by each customer.

00:41:19.100 --> 00:41:21.110
It's also great for society.

00:41:21.110 --> 00:41:22.790
It's a lot cheaper.

00:41:22.790 --> 00:41:25.540
And you take about half the
vehicle models off the road

00:41:25.540 --> 00:41:28.560
to provide the same or better mobility.

00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:33.560
- How do you see the
present financial crisis

00:41:34.530 --> 00:41:36.530
impacting on your set of ideas?

00:41:36.530 --> 00:41:39.260
It would seem to offer
a great opportunity,

00:41:39.260 --> 00:41:44.260
because what the old system
had going for it was waste.

00:41:45.530 --> 00:41:48.520
A system built to produce waste

00:41:48.520 --> 00:41:51.076
and to not think about

00:41:51.076 --> 00:41:54.100
the natural capital or the people capital

00:41:54.100 --> 00:41:55.300
in the way you're talking about.

00:41:55.300 --> 00:41:59.950
So, is this an opportunity?

00:41:59.950 --> 00:42:04.063
Are things, in a way, so serious that

00:42:04.063 --> 00:42:08.830
it's gonna fast forward the time that

00:42:08.830 --> 00:42:12.450
people see the changes that we need?

00:42:12.450 --> 00:42:17.440
- Well, at RMI, we're
practitioners, not theorists.

00:42:17.440 --> 00:42:20.260
We do solutions, not problems.

00:42:20.260 --> 00:42:22.900
We do transformation, not incrementalism.

00:42:22.900 --> 00:42:24.540
And times of crisis like this

00:42:24.540 --> 00:42:27.263
are wonderful transformational
opportunities.

00:42:28.701 --> 00:42:33.701
If what you want is a world
without waste or want or war,

00:42:35.390 --> 00:42:37.741
then all the principles
of natural capitalism

00:42:37.741 --> 00:42:40.740
are just what you need.

00:42:40.740 --> 00:42:42.840
And the more hard-pressed you are,

00:42:42.840 --> 00:42:46.170
personally or in your
business, to meet your goals,

00:42:46.170 --> 00:42:51.170
the more elegant frugality and
abundance by design you need

00:42:52.430 --> 00:42:54.350
and the better you need
the business models

00:42:54.350 --> 00:42:58.430
that reward provider and
customer interests together.

00:42:58.430 --> 00:43:00.240
That align those interests.

00:43:00.240 --> 00:43:04.740
So, I think this could
be a great opportunity.

00:43:04.740 --> 00:43:06.470
Just as a small example,

00:43:06.470 --> 00:43:08.770
I do a lot of work in
the automotive industry.

00:43:10.203 --> 00:43:12.895
- You had designed a car, actually.

00:43:12.895 --> 00:43:14.590
- Well, I figured out, in '91,

00:43:14.590 --> 00:43:16.570
how to do factor three to six

00:43:16.570 --> 00:43:21.150
more efficient, uncompromised
cars at about the same cost.

00:43:21.150 --> 00:43:24.890
And the industry wasn't ready.

00:43:24.890 --> 00:43:27.680
In particular, GM wasn't
ready culturally at that time

00:43:27.680 --> 00:43:29.630
to work seriously with outsiders.

00:43:29.630 --> 00:43:31.760
Especially a little nonprofit.

00:43:31.760 --> 00:43:34.290
So, we opensourced the idea in '93

00:43:34.290 --> 00:43:35.580
so nobody could patent it.

00:43:35.580 --> 00:43:37.720
Got everybody fighting over it.

00:43:37.720 --> 00:43:40.246
And, by 2000, the industry
had committed over $10 billion

00:43:40.246 --> 00:43:42.000
to this line of development,

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:44.360
which is more than a 3,000-fold multiplier

00:43:44.360 --> 00:43:46.343
for our R and D investment.

00:43:47.402 --> 00:43:50.020
And then we'd done a couple of spinoffs

00:43:50.020 --> 00:43:54.100
to provide a manufacturing solution.

00:43:54.100 --> 00:43:57.913
And now a plug-in hybrid
commercialization.

00:43:58.765 --> 00:44:03.765
But I think, now that this
tsunami of creative destruction

00:44:06.560 --> 00:44:08.403
is washing over Detroit,

00:44:09.980 --> 00:44:12.940
minds are opening quite wonderfully.

00:44:12.940 --> 00:44:16.310
The competition is changing
the managers or their minds.

00:44:16.310 --> 00:44:18.150
Whichever comes first.

00:44:18.150 --> 00:44:20.960
And they now are starting to realize that

00:44:20.960 --> 00:44:23.680
incrementalism is the high risk strategy.

00:44:23.680 --> 00:44:25.580
You know, imagine you're in the sumo ring

00:44:25.580 --> 00:44:28.273
with the world champion
sumo wrestler, Toyota-san.

00:44:29.220 --> 00:44:30.730
Do you keep training to try to get

00:44:30.730 --> 00:44:32.990
a little faster and
stronger than Toyota-san

00:44:32.990 --> 00:44:34.920
or do you maybe, halfway through,

00:44:34.920 --> 00:44:37.460
just quietly switch the game
to aikido and not tell him?

00:44:37.460 --> 00:44:39.680
This might be more promising.

00:44:39.680 --> 00:44:42.960
- You're something of a pessimist

00:44:42.960 --> 00:44:44.160
when it comes to government.

00:44:44.160 --> 00:44:46.130
Although you've worked
a lot with the Pentagon.

00:44:46.130 --> 00:44:50.410
And, as I go through some of
the stuff that you've written,

00:44:50.410 --> 00:44:55.410
I have the sense that you
worry about subsidies.

00:44:55.660 --> 00:44:58.261
For example, in the soft energy path,

00:44:58.261 --> 00:45:02.730
subsidies can be a
problem in the sense that,

00:45:02.730 --> 00:45:05.420
in the short term, the government giveth.

00:45:05.420 --> 00:45:08.330
But, in the long term, it takes away.

00:45:08.330 --> 00:45:11.220
So, I'm curious, in the present crisis...

00:45:11.220 --> 00:45:14.470
We're talking about the
automobile industry.

00:45:14.470 --> 00:45:16.110
We're in a situation where the government

00:45:16.110 --> 00:45:18.210
has already given 25 billion.

00:45:18.210 --> 00:45:21.480
Is promising another 15
billion to the auto...

00:45:21.480 --> 00:45:25.620
How would you like to
see things come together

00:45:25.620 --> 00:45:29.510
so that the kind of
natural capitalism ideas

00:45:29.510 --> 00:45:32.900
that you have on the
table would be implemented

00:45:32.900 --> 00:45:37.900
without government being
an obstruction in the path?

00:45:38.340 --> 00:45:42.160
- Well, I think an interesting
bit of history to look at

00:45:42.160 --> 00:45:44.900
is how, at the start of World War II,

00:45:44.900 --> 00:45:46.727
the automakers who were then making

00:45:46.727 --> 00:45:49.133
four million cars a year,

00:45:51.130 --> 00:45:54.740
switched completely in six
months to making no cars,

00:45:54.740 --> 00:45:58.670
but to making the Jeeps,
tanks, planes, munitions.

00:45:58.670 --> 00:46:00.063
The stuff that won the war.

00:46:01.950 --> 00:46:05.430
If you take seriously, as I do,

00:46:05.430 --> 00:46:09.770
the security, prosperity,
and climate implications

00:46:09.770 --> 00:46:11.283
of our oil dependence,

00:46:13.470 --> 00:46:18.470
the economic collapse of
automaking in this country

00:46:18.510 --> 00:46:20.655
is a wonderful opportunity to do something

00:46:20.655 --> 00:46:24.250
more in the spirit of that wartime urgency

00:46:24.250 --> 00:46:27.820
in retooling, retraining,
rejigging that industry

00:46:27.820 --> 00:46:29.980
to use its wonderful skills

00:46:29.980 --> 00:46:32.850
to produce the kinds of vehicles we need.

00:46:32.850 --> 00:46:37.850
Which can be big, sporty,
but also super efficient.

00:46:39.620 --> 00:46:41.860
I'm not talking about incremental gains

00:46:41.860 --> 00:46:43.410
or even what's in the present law.

00:46:43.410 --> 00:46:45.360
I'm talking about what the market

00:46:45.360 --> 00:46:48.423
and other conditions on us require.

00:46:49.806 --> 00:46:53.430
Factor three to six
improvement is straightforward.

00:46:53.430 --> 00:46:56.696
At least factor three
improvement doesn't cost anymore

00:46:56.696 --> 00:46:58.660
with modern techniques.

00:46:58.660 --> 00:47:00.070
We already have lightweighting

00:47:00.070 --> 00:47:02.857
and electrification revolutions
starting in the industry.

00:47:02.857 --> 00:47:05.820
But they are normally
assumed to come in slowly

00:47:05.820 --> 00:47:08.845
because of all of the constraints on

00:47:08.845 --> 00:47:11.920
how little money we have to retool with.

00:47:11.920 --> 00:47:15.420
Well, if we're going to have
to rebuild this industry

00:47:15.420 --> 00:47:17.800
anyway to get it back on its feet,

00:47:17.800 --> 00:47:20.070
let's jump to the best stuff.

00:47:20.070 --> 00:47:22.890
Because that's what foreign competitors

00:47:22.890 --> 00:47:25.160
are going to be bringing to us anyway.

00:47:25.160 --> 00:47:28.000
And we really have a
choice whether we're going

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:33.000
to keep importing
efficient cars to save oil

00:47:33.590 --> 00:47:36.450
or whether we're gonna make efficient cars

00:47:36.450 --> 00:47:38.870
and import neither the oil nor the cars.

00:47:38.870 --> 00:47:42.360
And there's one or two million
jobs hanging in the balance.

00:47:42.360 --> 00:47:45.930
- So, the elements here
of really moving forward

00:47:45.930 --> 00:47:47.140
on some of these ideas that

00:47:47.140 --> 00:47:52.140
we have climate change and the
energy crisis coming together

00:47:53.660 --> 00:47:58.660
at a time of a really
serious economic collapse.

00:47:58.980 --> 00:48:02.400
- Well, what we need to do in energy

00:48:02.400 --> 00:48:07.400
to solve our economic and
security and climate problems

00:48:07.710 --> 00:48:10.450
are all the same thing.

00:48:10.450 --> 00:48:12.400
You have exactly the same set of actions

00:48:12.400 --> 00:48:14.200
to solve all those problems at once.

00:48:14.200 --> 00:48:16.730
There's no compromise or tradeoff.

00:48:16.730 --> 00:48:19.890
And you said earlier I'm
pessimistic about government.

00:48:19.890 --> 00:48:21.470
Not natively so.

00:48:21.470 --> 00:48:24.440
I have a great admiration
for many of the institutions

00:48:24.440 --> 00:48:26.063
and individuals in government.

00:48:26.990 --> 00:48:30.100
And there is often very
effective government,

00:48:30.100 --> 00:48:33.480
particularly at more of
a state or local level.

00:48:33.480 --> 00:48:35.020
At the federal level,

00:48:35.020 --> 00:48:38.240
we have the best government money can buy,

00:48:38.240 --> 00:48:40.770
because we've been
proceeding, for some years,

00:48:40.770 --> 00:48:43.150
on a one dollar, one vote system.

00:48:43.150 --> 00:48:46.410
I think there's a whiff
of change in the air.

00:48:46.410 --> 00:48:50.224
And, you know, we can't go on this way.

00:48:50.224 --> 00:48:52.433
But Churchill said,
"You can always count on

00:48:52.433 --> 00:48:55.580
the Americans to do the right thing

00:48:55.580 --> 00:48:57.900
once they've exhausted
all other alternatives."

00:48:57.900 --> 00:49:00.550
We must be pretty near the
bottom of the list by now.

00:49:01.594 --> 00:49:04.240
- Let's take the example of nuclear power,

00:49:04.240 --> 00:49:09.240
because that's a case
where private capital,

00:49:09.460 --> 00:49:14.460
you point out, has not
put its money on the table

00:49:14.620 --> 00:49:17.230
for building more nuclear power plants.

00:49:17.230 --> 00:49:20.010
- There isn't a penny of
private investment at risk

00:49:20.010 --> 00:49:21.850
in any new nuclear plant in the world.

00:49:21.850 --> 00:49:23.340
Other than that of the vendors.

00:49:23.340 --> 00:49:25.553
- Whereas there has been
a lot of private capital

00:49:25.553 --> 00:49:27.870
down the soft energy path.

00:49:27.870 --> 00:49:28.966
But the question is...

00:49:28.966 --> 00:49:33.966
- $148 billion of clean
energy private capital

00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:36.090
last year worldwide.

00:49:36.090 --> 00:49:39.778
- Are you worried that government
will make the wrong choice

00:49:39.778 --> 00:49:41.500
in this regard?

00:49:41.500 --> 00:49:44.350
I'm trying to understand...

00:49:44.350 --> 00:49:46.750
'Cause you have a set of ideas.

00:49:46.750 --> 00:49:49.560
We have the moment of opportunity.

00:49:49.560 --> 00:49:53.770
I want to anticipate the
way things could go wrong

00:49:53.770 --> 00:49:55.208
so they won't.

00:49:55.208 --> 00:49:56.310
(laughter)

00:49:56.310 --> 00:49:59.620
- Well, nuclear's already died of

00:49:59.620 --> 00:50:02.046
an incurable attack of market forces.

00:50:02.046 --> 00:50:04.990
100 plus percent new subsidies in the US

00:50:04.990 --> 00:50:07.380
have failed to elicit a
penny of private investment.

00:50:07.380 --> 00:50:10.500
That was before the
capital market went away.

00:50:10.500 --> 00:50:13.420
And I think, now that it has gone away,

00:50:13.420 --> 00:50:17.305
it's even less possible to imagine

00:50:17.305 --> 00:50:20.820
financing 10 or $15 billion plants

00:50:22.740 --> 00:50:24.830
that are big, slow, lumpy.

00:50:24.830 --> 00:50:26.580
Therefore, high risk investments that

00:50:26.580 --> 00:50:29.210
are guaranteed obsolete
before they can be built.

00:50:29.210 --> 00:50:31.170
That's true not just of nuclear,

00:50:31.170 --> 00:50:32.610
but of coal plants, gas plants,

00:50:32.610 --> 00:50:36.110
any kind of big thermal plant
is already uncompetitive.

00:50:36.110 --> 00:50:38.570
It's too late to build those.

00:50:38.570 --> 00:50:41.090
And the market is rejecting them rapidly.

00:50:41.090 --> 00:50:46.090
I mean, just in 2007,
the US or China or Spain

00:50:47.910 --> 00:50:51.130
added more wind power than
the world added nuclear power.

00:50:51.130 --> 00:50:54.360
And the US added more
wind power, led by Texas,

00:50:54.360 --> 00:50:55.700
than we've added coal plants

00:50:55.700 --> 00:50:58.330
in the last five years put together.

00:50:58.330 --> 00:50:59.901
I don't know what part of the story

00:50:59.901 --> 00:51:03.290
anyone who takes market
seriously doesn't get.

00:51:03.290 --> 00:51:05.150
But the last four years data...

00:51:05.150 --> 00:51:06.202
We have 2006.

00:51:06.202 --> 00:51:08.670
Nuclear worldwide added less capacity

00:51:08.670 --> 00:51:11.430
than photovoltaics did, a
tenth what wind power did.

00:51:11.430 --> 00:51:14.030
30 or 40 times less than micropower did.

00:51:14.030 --> 00:51:16.610
And that doesn't even
count electric savings.

00:51:16.610 --> 00:51:19.570
Altogether, the big thermal power plants

00:51:19.570 --> 00:51:21.058
we're told are so indispensable

00:51:21.058 --> 00:51:23.060
are now minority market share.

00:51:23.060 --> 00:51:24.270
They're providing less than half

00:51:24.270 --> 00:51:25.730
of the world's new electrical services,

00:51:25.730 --> 00:51:26.770
'cause they cost too much

00:51:26.770 --> 00:51:28.430
and they have too much financial risk.

00:51:28.430 --> 00:51:30.440
So, the revolution's already happened.

00:51:30.440 --> 00:51:31.414
Sorry if you missed it.

00:51:31.414 --> 00:51:33.780
And governments can have,

00:51:33.780 --> 00:51:36.270
regardless of their level
of nuclear enthusiasm,

00:51:36.270 --> 00:51:38.450
only as many nuclear
plants as they can force

00:51:38.450 --> 00:51:40.030
the taxpayers to buy,

00:51:40.030 --> 00:51:42.310
because investors aren't that dumb.

00:51:42.310 --> 00:51:43.730
- So, what do you worry about

00:51:43.730 --> 00:51:48.010
in terms of not seizing this opportunity?

00:51:48.010 --> 00:51:50.230
- Well, if we spend our
money on the wrong stuff,

00:51:50.230 --> 00:51:52.680
we make all our problems worse.

00:51:52.680 --> 00:51:55.560
For example, if you buy
a new nuclear plant,

00:51:55.560 --> 00:51:58.873
you're gonna get about two to 11 odd times

00:51:58.873 --> 00:52:03.486
less carbon displacement
to protect the climate.

00:52:03.486 --> 00:52:06.610
And you'll get it 20 to 40 times slower

00:52:06.610 --> 00:52:09.430
than if you'd bought efficiency
in micropower instead.

00:52:09.430 --> 00:52:11.080
The market winners.

00:52:11.080 --> 00:52:15.890
In fact, if you buy nuclear
instead of efficiency,

00:52:15.890 --> 00:52:18.750
you will thereby cause
more carbon to be released

00:52:18.750 --> 00:52:19.970
than if you'd spent the same money

00:52:19.970 --> 00:52:21.303
buying a new coal plant.

00:52:22.170 --> 00:52:27.170
But this little problem with not picking

00:52:28.420 --> 00:52:32.580
the cheapest, fastest method
of protecting the climate

00:52:32.580 --> 00:52:34.590
has gone largely unnoticed.

00:52:34.590 --> 00:52:36.750
And the nuclear industry
is desperately keen

00:52:36.750 --> 00:52:38.055
that you not notice it.

00:52:38.055 --> 00:52:41.000
Because they say, "Well,
we're carbon free."

00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:42.250
Well, that's not good enough.

00:52:42.250 --> 00:52:44.990
You have to be also cheaper and faster

00:52:44.990 --> 00:52:47.500
than other ways to protect the climate.

00:52:47.500 --> 00:52:48.333
And they're not.

00:52:49.670 --> 00:52:54.670
So, I think there's
this prevalent myth that

00:52:56.460 --> 00:52:59.391
energy policy is like a
Chinese restaurant menu.

00:52:59.391 --> 00:53:02.060
You know, the big old kind where

00:53:02.060 --> 00:53:04.510
you select one thing from
column A and one from column B

00:53:04.510 --> 00:53:06.880
and so on until everybody who contributed

00:53:06.880 --> 00:53:08.810
a lot to your campaign is happy.

00:53:08.810 --> 00:53:11.510
Well, if you actually order

00:53:11.510 --> 00:53:13.090
that way in a Chinese restaurant,

00:53:13.090 --> 00:53:17.790
you'll probably have indigestion
and possibly bankruptcy.

00:53:17.790 --> 00:53:19.650
And, if you actually spend all your money

00:53:19.650 --> 00:53:21.030
on the delicacies,

00:53:21.030 --> 00:53:25.270
you may not get enough rice
to avoid going away hungry.

00:53:25.270 --> 00:53:28.460
So, you really have to choose judiciously,

00:53:28.460 --> 00:53:32.760
not indiscriminately, from our
big menu of energy choices.

00:53:32.760 --> 00:53:37.760
And pick the right
combination of best buys

00:53:37.820 --> 00:53:40.510
that will solve your problems

00:53:40.510 --> 00:53:42.260
quickest, fastest, cheapest.

00:53:42.260 --> 00:53:44.347
We have a lot of other things
we need to spend money on.

00:53:44.347 --> 00:53:46.447
And energy doesn't need to be one of them.

00:53:50.260 --> 00:53:51.920
I think, more broadly,

00:53:51.920 --> 00:53:56.180
we need a transideological
and, in some ways,

00:53:56.180 --> 00:53:59.108
a deeply conservative
approach to energy policy.

00:53:59.108 --> 00:54:01.480
What I would love to see is

00:54:01.480 --> 00:54:04.980
for all ways to save or produce energy

00:54:04.980 --> 00:54:07.640
to compete fairly at honest prices

00:54:07.640 --> 00:54:09.270
regardless of which kind they are,

00:54:09.270 --> 00:54:12.440
what technology they use, where they are,

00:54:12.440 --> 00:54:15.030
how big they are, or who owns them.

00:54:15.030 --> 00:54:17.473
Let's see who's not in favor of that.

00:54:18.701 --> 00:54:21.270
Well, let me venture a prediction.

00:54:21.270 --> 00:54:22.677
It's going to be the incumbents

00:54:22.677 --> 00:54:26.520
who have paid a lot of money to install

00:54:26.520 --> 00:54:29.010
large troughs shoveled
full of public money

00:54:29.010 --> 00:54:30.660
and they have their snouts in the trough

00:54:30.660 --> 00:54:33.520
and are very happy with this arrangement.

00:54:33.520 --> 00:54:34.356
- One final question.

00:54:34.356 --> 00:54:36.680
Looking back at your career,

00:54:36.680 --> 00:54:40.863
how would you advise students
to prepare for their future?

00:54:42.900 --> 00:54:47.900
- Fearlessly, adventurously,
and with complete disregard

00:54:48.014 --> 00:54:52.963
to any suggestions about how
to structure their curriculum.

00:54:54.143 --> 00:54:57.310
They'll probably do a lot more good

00:54:58.400 --> 00:55:02.800
if they've studied chemical engineering,

00:55:02.800 --> 00:55:05.900
cultural anthropology, and Chinese history

00:55:07.010 --> 00:55:09.503
than if they are deep and narrow.

00:55:12.380 --> 00:55:15.440
And, if your advisor raises eyebrows

00:55:15.440 --> 00:55:17.460
looking at your proposed course of study

00:55:17.460 --> 00:55:19.820
and says, "I don't see what
this has to do with that."

00:55:19.820 --> 00:55:21.952
Then you're probably on the right track.

00:55:21.952 --> 00:55:22.785
(laughter)

00:55:22.785 --> 00:55:25.250
- On that note, I wanna thank you for

00:55:25.250 --> 00:55:26.690
coming to the campus to be

00:55:26.690 --> 00:55:30.100
the Weinstock Lecturer later today.

00:55:30.100 --> 00:55:33.170
And thank you for taking the
time to have this conversation.

00:55:33.170 --> 00:55:34.003
- Thank you.

00:55:34.003 --> 00:55:36.010
- And thank you very much for joining us

00:55:36.010 --> 00:55:37.903
for this Conversation with History.

00:55:40.568 --> 00:55:43.151
(upbeat music)
