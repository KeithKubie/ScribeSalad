00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.350
So the answer here is that the lines are executed 1,048,576 times

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:10.500
or just about a million times.

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.810
And the way you calculate this is very similar to here above.

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:18.430
So instead of 2^5, you now have to take 2^20 because--

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:23.160
for the 20 communication centers--you're trying all separate possibilities

00:00:23.160 --> 99:59:59.000
of having them with a monitoring device or not.
