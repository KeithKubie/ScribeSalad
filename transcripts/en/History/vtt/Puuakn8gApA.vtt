00:00:01.418 --> 00:00:02.627
- What do we got here?

00:00:02.627 --> 00:00:06.423
A 1936 [inaudible]
Zeiss camera.

00:00:06.423 --> 00:00:08.508
Sweet.
And where did you get this?

00:00:08.508 --> 00:00:11.219
We do clean outs for
different storage facilities.

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.848
And for his pay for the
day, this is what he wanted.

00:00:14.848 --> 00:00:17.100
OK.
So how old are you?

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.476
14.

00:00:18.476 --> 00:00:19.686
You know, they were
still using these things

00:00:19.686 --> 00:00:20.270
when I was 14.

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:25.525
The camera I'm
coming in to sell today

00:00:25.525 --> 00:00:28.486
is a 1936 Zeiss movie camera.

00:00:28.486 --> 00:00:31.614
We know very little
about this movie camera.

00:00:31.614 --> 00:00:33.658
But it's really cool.

00:00:33.658 --> 00:00:35.952
The appraiser that we
went to said that he

00:00:35.952 --> 00:00:37.912
has never seen one of these.

00:00:37.912 --> 00:00:39.581
He's only seen two.

00:00:39.581 --> 00:00:41.207
Sorry.

00:00:41.207 --> 00:00:42.876
This is really neat.

00:00:42.876 --> 00:00:48.173
So you have a Zeiss
16 millimeter camera.

00:00:48.173 --> 00:00:50.759
I looked it up some
for like, 20 minutes

00:00:50.759 --> 00:00:55.180
and said, can't
find nothing on it.

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:58.892
Kodak came out with 16
millimeter early 1920s,

00:00:58.892 --> 00:01:00.643
and they were
hoping that it would

00:01:00.643 --> 00:01:02.854
be a home movie camera, OK?

00:01:02.854 --> 00:01:05.440
The problem was it was
really damn expensive.

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.400
Most people-- 99% of
people in this country

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.068
couldn't afford it.

00:01:09.068 --> 00:01:11.738
But news organizations loved
them, because you could run

00:01:11.738 --> 00:01:13.323
around, get a news
story, and you

00:01:13.323 --> 00:01:15.283
could sell it to the newsreels.

00:01:15.283 --> 00:01:17.911
Anyone who has gone to
film school at one point

00:01:17.911 --> 00:01:20.205
probably used a 16
millimeter camera.

00:01:20.205 --> 00:01:24.125
It's an incredible pain
to load, develop film,

00:01:24.125 --> 00:01:25.835
and everything else.

00:01:25.835 --> 00:01:29.172
But it makes incredible images
that you still, to this day,

00:01:29.172 --> 00:01:31.841
cannot get on video.

00:01:31.841 --> 00:01:33.343
Why are you selling it?

00:01:33.343 --> 00:01:35.970
We do demolition derbies,
and I was hoping to get

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.848
enough for me to buy a car.
- OK.

00:01:38.848 --> 00:01:39.808
You ever tried it?

00:01:39.808 --> 00:01:41.392
No.

00:01:41.392 --> 00:01:44.896
It's the most fun you can
have with your clothes on.

00:01:44.896 --> 00:01:48.441
What were you looking
to get out of it?

00:01:48.441 --> 00:01:51.027
At least $800.

00:01:51.027 --> 00:01:53.488
You know, you've got a
really interesting camera here.

00:01:53.488 --> 00:01:55.949
Everything is in great shape,
looks like it was barely used.

00:01:55.949 --> 00:01:59.077
But the problem is they just
don't go for that much money,

00:01:59.077 --> 00:02:00.495
because there's so
many of them out there.

00:02:00.495 --> 00:02:02.038
I mean, you know, once
the video came out,

00:02:02.038 --> 00:02:04.457
all these things
threw on a shelf.

00:02:04.457 --> 00:02:06.334
Well we went to
an appraiser for it,

00:02:06.334 --> 00:02:08.920
and he said he
has only seen two.

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:12.090
And he said the first one he
saw looked like it had got hit

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.218
by a truck, and it was $250.

00:02:15.218 --> 00:02:18.179
OK, well, see, this is one
of the things about this world.

00:02:18.179 --> 00:02:20.348
People can ask for
money all day long,

00:02:20.348 --> 00:02:22.517
it's whether they get it or not.

00:02:22.517 --> 00:02:23.476
I'll give you 100 bucks for it.

00:02:26.312 --> 00:02:29.190
Nah, we'll do a
little better than that.

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.985
I think $100 is
really insulting.

00:02:31.985 --> 00:02:35.697
Bottom dollar will be $400.

00:02:35.697 --> 00:02:36.739
No.

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:41.244
Unfortunately, it's not here.

00:02:41.244 --> 00:02:42.996
No one uses these anymore.

00:02:42.996 --> 00:02:44.956
I am being a nice guy offering
100 bucks because it will sit

00:02:44.956 --> 00:02:46.082
around for a very long time.

00:02:50.503 --> 00:02:52.088
I don't think I'm going
to be able to do that.

00:02:52.088 --> 00:02:53.256
OK.

00:02:53.256 --> 00:02:54.424
Well, thanks for
coming in, though.

00:02:54.424 --> 00:02:56.593
I'm going to take
the camera home,

00:02:56.593 --> 00:03:00.513
and probably put it on a
shelf, and wait 20 years.

00:03:00.513 --> 00:03:01.681
Not a big deal.

00:03:01.681 --> 00:03:02.682
He'll hustle something else.
