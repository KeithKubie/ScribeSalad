LOGAN URY: Thank
you all for coming.

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:06.850
My name is Logan Ury, and I
run a behavioral economics team

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:08.830
at Google called Irrational Lab.

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:11.580
It is my pleasure to introduce
our very special guest Roman

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:12.080
Mars.

00:00:18.505 --> 00:00:21.770
So as you probably know,
Roman is the host and creator

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:24.660
of "99% Invisible,"
a short radio

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.070
show about design
and architecture.

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:30.710
With over 40 million downloads,
the "99% Invisible" podcast

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:33.530
is one of those popular
podcasts in the world.

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:36.730
Fast Company named him one of
the 100 most creative people

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:38.470
in 2013.

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:41.150
He was a TED main stage
speaker this year,

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:45.510
and his crowd funding campaigns
have raised over $1.16 million,

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.180
making him the highest-funded
journalist in Kickstarter

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.500
history.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.670
He is also a co-founder
of Radiotopia,

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:55.170
a collective of groundbreaking
story-driven podcasts.

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.190
And I'd like to add he also
has twin boys with possibly

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:02.642
the coolest names ever, Mazlo
Rocket Mars and Carver Atomic

00:01:02.642 --> 00:01:03.142
Mars.

00:01:05.854 --> 00:01:06.520
Congratulations.

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:09.159
ROMAN MARS: It's true.

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:11.450
LOGAN URY: So, Roman, thank
you so much for joining us.

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:12.210
ROMAN MARS: Thank
you for having me.

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.376
LOGAN URY: I want to start
with some basic questions

00:01:14.376 --> 00:01:15.640
about the show.

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.780
So at one point you were
getting your PhD in genetics,

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.260
setting a gene cluster in corn.

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.040
How did you wind up
creating "99% Invisible,"

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:25.369
and what's your mission?

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:27.910
ROMAN MARS: Well, there's a lot
of distance between those two

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:28.600
things.

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.650
So I studied genetics.

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.390
I loved going to school,
and when college ended,

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:37.670
I just wanted to
go to more school.

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:39.670
And so I did that.

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:42.390
But then I realized after
I'd finished my classes

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.610
and finished my
teaching that I was not

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:45.680
meant to be a scientist.

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.060
It just was not in me.

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.720
And so one of the things
I loved was public radio.

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.460
I listen to public
radio all the time.

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:54.360
I didn't have a TV.

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:00.450
And at a certain point
when I moved out here,

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.969
and I was listening to
a lot of public radio.

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:05.260
And I love the way they talked.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:06.390
I love the way they did things.

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:07.980
And it reminded me
of teaching, which

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:10.690
is my favorite part of
being a graduate student.

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.710
And so I've just made
it my mission in life

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:18.760
to just rearrange everything to
become a public radio producer.

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.570
Because I didn't know
what the job was,

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:22.800
but I knew there
was someone who told

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.880
Ray Suarez on Talk of the
Nation what questions to ask

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:27.710
who read the books.

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:29.430
And I was always good at that.

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.312
And when I was a
graduate student,

00:02:31.312 --> 00:02:33.770
my favorite thing was leading
seminars, and reading papers,

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:35.090
and stuff like that.

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.130
And I knew there was
someone who did that job.

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:40.280
And so I rearranged my life
to kind of make that happen.

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.110
And then "99%
Invisible" came about

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:46.920
because I'd been working
radio at that point for about

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.560
a decade, actually.

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:53.810
And I'd been to Chicago and I
moved back when I had the boys.

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:58.050
And there was the AIA of
San Francisco and KALW.

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.740
They had this idea of putting
together a little architecture

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:08.150
minute, a little drop-in
story about a local building.

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.425
And they asked me what
I'd thought about that,

00:03:10.425 --> 00:03:13.169
and would I be interested
in doing something about it.

00:03:13.169 --> 00:03:15.210
And I'd began to plan it
and sort of sound design

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.890
the idea of it.

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:17.380
And I met with all these
people and I was like,

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:18.940
I would totally love
to do this show.

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:22.859
At the time I was working on
a show called "Snap Judgment."

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:24.650
I was their first senior
producer, and sort

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:28.020
of getting them going in radio.

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:30.740
And I loved "Snap
Judgment," but the style

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:33.100
is extremely emotional
storytelling.

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:35.280
There's very few facts.

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.110
And I'm very fact.

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:39.480
I just am didactic by nature.

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:42.580
And I wanted something that
used my teaching voice.

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:44.560
And so that's what
"99% Invisible"

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.520
became my outlet for that.

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:48.060
And I hadn't hosted
in a long time,

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.620
and so it was fun to
conceive of a project

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:52.526
where I would host again.

00:03:52.526 --> 00:03:54.000
And so that was what it was for.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.700
LOGAN URY: That's great.

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:56.908
So at lunch we talked about
some of the worst pitches

00:03:56.908 --> 00:03:58.360
that you get.

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:00.110
Where do you actually
get some of the best

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:02.017
inspiration for the show?

00:04:02.017 --> 00:04:04.100
ROMAN MARS: I mean, the
best thing about the show,

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:05.680
the best thing about
covering design,

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:09.580
is that it's a way of covering
everything and nothing

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:10.570
at the same time.

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:12.952
You can kind of find
inspiration anywhere.

00:04:12.952 --> 00:04:14.785
And so I take pictures
of things constantly.

00:04:17.529 --> 00:04:19.370
And so the best
things come from me

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:21.082
trying to scratch
an itch of something

00:04:21.082 --> 00:04:22.040
that I'm interested in.

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:27.880
And then it usually takes
some kind of second fact

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:29.440
to turn it into an actual story.

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:33.230
So we'll find some weird
plaque or some weird thing

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:35.450
and I'll have no idea
what that's about.

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:39.426
And then it'll stick in my head,
and then another instance of it

00:04:39.426 --> 00:04:41.800
will come up and then all of
a sudden it becomes a thing.

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:48.000
So the flag thing, which is
one of my weird obsessions,

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.030
is flags.

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:54.960
And that story, because I was
in Chicago, and I move there.

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:59.240
And I was like, what the fuck
is that thing I see everywhere,

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:01.220
and do other cities have flags?

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:03.127
I didn't understand it.

00:05:03.127 --> 00:05:04.960
And that was something
that stuck in my head

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:09.229
for a long time, turning
that into a story.

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:11.270
But it wasn't until I came
back to San Francisco,

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:13.590
and realized I'd never
seen the flag there,

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:17.420
and then why I'd
never seen the flag.

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:18.452
Because it's terrible.

00:05:18.452 --> 00:05:19.750
LOGAN URY: For those who
haven't seen [INAUDIBLE],

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:21.640
you should see the
San Francisco flag.

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:24.660
ROMAN MARS: It's not pretty.

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:26.400
And then that became a story.

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:31.700
And that was like the sixth
episode of "99% Invisible."

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:34.670
And it's something that was
just kind of stuck in my craw

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:37.960
for like a long time
until it had an outlet.

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:40.700
LOGAN URY: So now we understand
where you get inspiration from.

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:43.480
Can you walk us through the
process of making an episode,

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:46.346
from getting an idea to
eventually publishing it?

00:05:46.346 --> 00:05:47.720
ROMAN MARS: Well,
in the old days

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:49.060
it was basically like that.

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:50.884
I would have some
idea in my head.

00:05:50.884 --> 00:05:52.050
I would start working on it.

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:54.508
One of the great things about
it-- because in the beginning

00:05:54.508 --> 00:05:56.650
the shows were just
four minutes long--

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:59.590
so you can make anything.

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:02.070
It barely has to have a story
to be four minutes long.

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:05.360
You just have to
have a couple facts.

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:11.017
Nowadays I have a team
of people, Sam Greenspan,

00:06:11.017 --> 00:06:12.600
and Katie Mingle,
and Avery Trufelman.

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:17.080
They work for me and
we all sit in a room.

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:19.510
And we get pitches
in from the outside

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:22.590
and they pitch
things internally.

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:26.750
And then we assign someone
to be the primary reporter,

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:29.730
and that comes back to
me, and then we edit it.

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:30.840
Katie edits at first.

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:31.860
She's our main editor.

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:35.330
Then it's a long process.

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:39.360
Somebody presents a script.

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:40.910
Basically, they come
up with an idea,

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:45.300
we talk about what's interesting
to us about it, what's

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:46.900
the angle of the show.

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:49.630
And then they go and
do the interviews

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:51.670
and start to put it together.

00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:54.170
And we discuss it again and
then they put together a script.

00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:57.690
And then that script goes
through all these iterations,

00:06:57.690 --> 00:07:00.360
and then we perform it
a couple times together.

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:01.769
And then we perform it to tape.

00:07:01.769 --> 00:07:02.810
It's just a long process.

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:05.380
LOGAN URY: So how
long will that take?

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:10.710
ROMAN MARS: I would say on
average a comfortable show

00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:13.220
takes about four to five weeks.

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:13.845
LOGAN URY: Wow.

00:07:13.845 --> 00:07:17.554
And does most of what you
record get put into an episode?

00:07:17.554 --> 00:07:18.720
ROMAN MARS: Oh no not even--

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:20.440
LOGAN URY: What percentage
do you think makes it in?

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:21.690
ROMAN MARS: Like an interview?

00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:24.560
I would say every single
interview is usually an hour,

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:27.969
and we probably use four
or five minutes of it.

00:07:27.969 --> 00:07:29.010
LOGAN URY: Or none of it.

00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:30.093
ROMAN MARS: Or none of it.

00:07:30.093 --> 00:07:32.440
Yeah, pretty often.

00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:35.670
And then we kill certain
stories we pursued.

00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:37.850
They're just not working,
and they just get killed.

00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:41.480
That's a luxury that happens
when you have a staff.

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:46.871
Back in the old days, I
would squeeze a story.

00:07:46.871 --> 00:07:51.160
If I had pursued it at all,
it was going to go on the air.

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:52.530
Because it was my nighttime job.

00:07:52.530 --> 00:07:54.899
I had to make it count.

00:07:54.899 --> 00:07:56.440
LOGAN URY: Can you
tell us about some

00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:58.230
of your favorite episodes
or favorite things

00:07:58.230 --> 00:07:59.063
that you've learned?

00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:03.716
ROMAN MARS: I'm terrible
with this question.

00:08:03.716 --> 00:08:05.090
I can tell you my
least favorite.

00:08:05.090 --> 00:08:06.881
My least favorite
episode is always the one

00:08:06.881 --> 00:08:08.880
I'm currently working on.

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:10.544
And I'm just like,
God, this sucks.

00:08:10.544 --> 00:08:12.460
LOGAN URY: What about
some really weird people

00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:13.668
who you've met along the way?

00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:17.260
ROMAN MARS: One of
the things that's

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:20.140
great about designers
and architects

00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:23.570
is they're extremely
passionate people.

00:08:23.570 --> 00:08:28.040
And so I like tapping into
other people's obsessions.

00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:33.544
And I catch it very
quickly or easily so

00:08:33.544 --> 00:08:36.900
if someone's really
into sidewalk stamps,

00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:39.530
then I become
infected immediately.

00:08:39.530 --> 00:08:41.915
And then I began taking
photographs of sidewalk stamps

00:08:41.915 --> 00:08:44.015
or flags or whatever.

00:08:44.015 --> 00:08:46.140
LOGAN URY: I think of you
as the manhole cover guy.

00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:47.223
ROMAN MARS: Yeah, exactly.

00:08:47.223 --> 00:08:48.960
So what I love is
when people ask

00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:51.800
me what's the quintessential
"99% Invisible" episode,

00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:53.960
I always say it's
like we cover manhole

00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:56.550
covers, even though we've
never covered manhole covers.

00:08:56.550 --> 00:09:00.760
And it's my internal
joke, for me and Sam.

00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:03.400
Yeah, that's our one we've never
done, but that's our thing.

00:09:10.426 --> 00:09:13.490
The weirdest thing that happened
in general with the show

00:09:13.490 --> 00:09:22.610
is when you start to notice
all the effort that people

00:09:22.610 --> 00:09:25.800
go into designing the world
and making it a better place.

00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:28.360
It makes you kind of
optimistic about the world,

00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:31.400
and I'm not naturally
wired that way.

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:33.050
And I think that's
the biggest change

00:09:33.050 --> 00:09:37.030
that I've seen in my life.

00:09:37.030 --> 00:09:41.770
I don't think that a lot of
the people that I grew up

00:09:41.770 --> 00:09:48.230
with when I was an angry
punk straightedge kid

00:09:48.230 --> 00:09:51.050
would say, "God, that Roman,
he just loves the world."

00:09:51.050 --> 00:09:53.190
You know what I mean?

00:09:53.190 --> 00:09:57.092
But it kind of rewired
me a little bit.

00:09:57.092 --> 00:09:59.300
LOGAN URY: It's sort of like
a pitch for mindfulness.

00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:01.175
If you're paying attention
things around you,

00:10:01.175 --> 00:10:03.100
you're happier, because
you notice more.

00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:04.790
ROMAN MARS: I think so.

00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:05.990
That's what I like.

00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:10.330
And that's what I've heard from
people who listen to the show.

00:10:10.330 --> 00:10:14.140
They began to tell me
the thesis of the show

00:10:14.140 --> 00:10:16.680
without me being very explicit
about the thesis of the show.

00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:20.210
About that mindfulness and
the joy of these things.

00:10:20.210 --> 00:10:22.566
LOGAN URY: Do you have a
dream episode, or dream guest

00:10:22.566 --> 00:10:23.940
you'd like to
feature on the show

00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:26.774
but haven't been able to yet?

00:10:26.774 --> 00:10:27.440
ROMAN MARS: Huh.

00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:33.120
I don't have a dream guest.

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:38.930
I don't tend to pursue
anything around a personality.

00:10:38.930 --> 00:10:40.630
I just don't have that in me.

00:10:40.630 --> 00:10:42.740
I don't know what that is.

00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:46.700
I'm often asked to interview
famous architects on stage

00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:49.900
or something like that, and
I'm like, I don't want to.

00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:51.374
It's just not my thing.

00:10:51.374 --> 00:10:52.540
LOGAN URY: I totally relate.

00:10:57.340 --> 00:10:59.920
ROMAN MARS: But I don't have
anything to add to that.

00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:01.709
Especially if
they're famous enough

00:11:01.709 --> 00:11:03.500
to be interviewed on
a big stage somewhere,

00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:07.360
then I have nothing
to contribute to that.

00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:09.270
My favorite person
to interview is

00:11:09.270 --> 00:11:12.920
the person who wrote some
blog post five years ago

00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:15.130
that I found.

00:11:15.130 --> 00:11:17.530
And they're just
stoked I'm there.

00:11:17.530 --> 00:11:21.137
LOGAN URY: Are you thinking
about somebody right now?

00:11:21.137 --> 00:11:22.720
ROMAN MARS: Like the
sidewalk stamper.

00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:24.150
We had never done
that as a story yet.

00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:25.566
We were going to
do it as a video.

00:11:25.566 --> 00:11:32.550
But he was hard to find because
his blog was really old.

00:11:32.550 --> 00:11:34.740
That type of thing.

00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:37.100
I like connecting with
those people the best.

00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:38.551
That's what makes me happy.

00:11:38.551 --> 00:11:40.800
LOGAN URY: So we just watched
your TED talk last night

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:42.285
on state flags.

00:11:42.285 --> 00:11:45.030
Can you talk to us a little bit
about your experience at TED,

00:11:45.030 --> 00:11:46.630
and about how you
chose this topic,

00:11:46.630 --> 00:11:50.350
and maybe what else
you considered?

00:11:50.350 --> 00:11:52.970
ROMAN MARS: TED
was a real treat.

00:11:52.970 --> 00:11:54.310
I really loved it.

00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:57.290
It's kind of like being here,
where you just walk around

00:11:57.290 --> 00:11:59.480
and pick shit up and drink it.

00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:01.900
You go out and grab
whatever you want to,

00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:05.520
and it's all free and
available, and everything's

00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:06.275
nice and clean.

00:12:10.030 --> 00:12:12.360
So I loved it.

00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:14.680
Rock on.

00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:18.230
What I loved about
TED is I think

00:12:18.230 --> 00:12:21.730
you see a lot of TED talks.

00:12:21.730 --> 00:12:24.540
I think everyone has their
own impression of what

00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:29.410
TED is about, and when
you're asked to speak at TED.

00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:34.850
I've done hundreds
of radio stories

00:12:34.850 --> 00:12:36.620
and I've told kinds
of stories on stage

00:12:36.620 --> 00:12:38.900
and various other formats,
but there's something

00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:43.420
about doing a TED talk
which, you're thinking, well,

00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:45.510
do I have to do it
like a TED TED talk,

00:12:45.510 --> 00:12:47.780
or do I do it like
a normal talk, or--?

00:12:47.780 --> 00:12:50.190
It throws you off.

00:12:50.190 --> 00:12:56.700
And so I wrote a very
TED TED talk once which

00:12:56.700 --> 00:12:59.420
was kind of the big
grand unifying theory

00:12:59.420 --> 00:13:02.760
of the show and my existence.

00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:08.140
And I had little bits of
the show, the episodes,

00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:09.950
and I performed it a few times.

00:13:09.950 --> 00:13:13.860
Or in live settings I
would do pieces of it

00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:15.700
and see how it would fly.

00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:17.440
It was terrible, and I hated it.

00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:19.240
Hated it a lot.

00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:24.560
And so I called them and
I said, "I hate my talk.

00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:26.870
I think I want to
do one on flags."

00:13:26.870 --> 00:13:30.700
And they're like, OK.

00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:32.200
I said, "I have
this one that's kind

00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:37.410
of about design in everyday
things, and the love letters

00:13:37.410 --> 00:13:39.560
that designers leave
for you in the world.

00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:45.090
And I think it's OK, but I also
have this talk about flags.

00:13:45.090 --> 00:13:47.270
And they were like, "I
can tell in your voice.

00:13:47.270 --> 00:13:49.890
You should do the flag one."

00:13:49.890 --> 00:13:50.920
LOGAN URY: Good for TED.

00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:51.628
ROMAN MARS: Yeah.

00:13:51.628 --> 00:13:54.572
And then I stripped
out all the clips.

00:13:54.572 --> 00:13:55.280
I tried to do it.

00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:58.370
I was envisioning it of the
way you stand on the red dot

00:13:58.370 --> 00:14:01.180
and you have the
little microphone.

00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:02.850
And I had stripped
away all that stuff.

00:14:02.850 --> 00:14:06.170
And I said, "And
also when I perform I

00:14:06.170 --> 00:14:09.470
do this little thing
where I press the buttons

00:14:09.470 --> 00:14:12.840
and I talk over a lot
of music and stuff."

00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:16.030
And they were like, "Go for it.

00:14:16.030 --> 00:14:18.500
We'd love to see that happen."

00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:25.380
And so I had in my head what TED
was about, and TED is not that.

00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:27.950
If you are a neuroscientist
and you've never

00:14:27.950 --> 00:14:30.910
done a talk before, they know
how to make your talk good,

00:14:30.910 --> 00:14:32.580
and they will make
it fit that, and they

00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:34.170
know how to do that talk.

00:14:34.170 --> 00:14:37.130
But if you have some idea
as to what you want to do,

00:14:37.130 --> 00:14:38.392
they will totally let you go.

00:14:38.392 --> 00:14:39.100
It was free rein.

00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:41.270
It was really remarkable.

00:14:41.270 --> 00:14:43.410
And so I loved my
experience with them.

00:14:43.410 --> 00:14:44.960
I was totally into it.

00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:47.824
I met weird, crazy people,
and had just a great time.

00:14:47.824 --> 00:14:49.990
LOGAN URY: What was your
favorite talk that you saw?

00:14:53.740 --> 00:14:54.810
ROMAN MARS: Favorite.

00:14:54.810 --> 00:15:00.160
Well, my favorite set
was a lot of my friends

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:02.720
do a thing called "Pop Up
Magazine" up in the city.

00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:07.860
It was a set of-- I
loved all those mentally.

00:15:07.860 --> 00:15:10.950
The most striking one
was earlier in the day,

00:15:10.950 --> 00:15:12.780
when my talk was.

00:15:12.780 --> 00:15:15.430
Monica Lewinsky gave a
talk, and it was the buzz.

00:15:15.430 --> 00:15:18.280
It was the talk of
the whole conference.

00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:21.270
Of whether or not it was
going to be exploitative,

00:15:21.270 --> 00:15:22.890
or going to be
weird, or whatever.

00:15:22.890 --> 00:15:26.440
And she just went in and she
knocked it out of the park.

00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:28.000
And it was a joyous thing.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.870
She said, "I'm
now 41 years old."

00:15:30.870 --> 00:15:34.475
And my head exploded,
because in my mind, she's 24.

00:15:37.330 --> 00:15:40.670
So that was the biggest
experience of the talk.

00:15:40.670 --> 00:15:42.740
And then the first
day I show up,

00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:45.570
and then there's the
former Prime Minister

00:15:45.570 --> 00:15:50.550
of Australia, who normalized
trade relationships with China.

00:15:50.550 --> 00:15:54.150
I was like, why
the fuck am I here?

00:15:54.150 --> 00:15:57.790
My little flag talk.

00:15:57.790 --> 00:15:59.810
And that was intimidating,
but over the course,

00:15:59.810 --> 00:16:02.080
you start to see where
your place is in it.

00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:06.230
And you're like, oh yeah,
I'm meant to be comic relief.

00:16:06.230 --> 00:16:07.210
I got it.

00:16:07.210 --> 00:16:07.980
Cool, I can just--

00:16:07.980 --> 00:16:09.830
LOGAN URY: Well, you
got a standing ovation.

00:16:09.830 --> 00:16:10.070
ROMAN MARS: I know.

00:16:10.070 --> 00:16:10.580
I loved it.

00:16:10.580 --> 00:16:11.920
So that's the thing about TED.

00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:15.270
One of the things is there's all
these really important people.

00:16:15.270 --> 00:16:19.300
The next day the Nobel
Peace Prize winner,

00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:24.730
who freed 80,000 child
slaves, presented.

00:16:24.730 --> 00:16:26.439
And when he comes out,
you're like, well,

00:16:26.439 --> 00:16:28.063
that dude's getting
a standing ovation.

00:16:28.063 --> 00:16:28.920
I mean, seriously.

00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:30.350
He earned it.

00:16:30.350 --> 00:16:36.270
But when you make them stand
up for your little flag talk,

00:16:36.270 --> 00:16:39.400
I felt great after that.

00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:40.844
It was pretty fun.

00:16:40.844 --> 00:16:42.510
LOGAN URY: So one
thing I was wondering,

00:16:42.510 --> 00:16:44.093
since you're such a
big fan of design,

00:16:44.093 --> 00:16:46.050
is there a product
that you wished

00:16:46.050 --> 00:16:48.170
you'd designed because
you like it so much?

00:16:48.170 --> 00:16:49.323
ROMAN MARS: Oh no.

00:16:49.323 --> 00:16:52.430
The thing is I'm a fan
of design but I'd never

00:16:52.430 --> 00:16:54.850
want to-- I don't
want to be a designer.

00:16:54.850 --> 00:16:58.324
I'm a professional appreciater.

00:16:58.324 --> 00:16:59.990
LOGAN URY: Those who
can't do, do radio.

00:16:59.990 --> 00:17:00.880
ROMAN MARS: Maybe.

00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:03.030
That was the same way with me.

00:17:03.030 --> 00:17:07.339
I was a huge punk and
hardcore music fan,

00:17:07.339 --> 00:17:08.630
but I was never in a band.

00:17:08.630 --> 00:17:12.260
I just was like,
I'll be there early.

00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:14.410
I'll buy the seven inch.

00:17:14.410 --> 00:17:15.892
That's my deal.

00:17:15.892 --> 00:17:17.725
LOGAN URY: You're a
professional enthusiast.

00:17:17.725 --> 00:17:19.490
ROMAN MARS: I'm totally a
professional enthusiast.

00:17:19.490 --> 00:17:21.906
LOGAN URY: Anything that you
would like to redesign, maybe

00:17:21.906 --> 00:17:24.390
not as a designer but
like, grocery store

00:17:24.390 --> 00:17:25.484
cards drive me crazy?

00:17:28.369 --> 00:17:32.160
ROMAN MARS: Well, the one in
my lifetime, which I think

00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:33.660
is coming.

00:17:33.660 --> 00:17:35.770
The fax machine has to die.

00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:40.990
Every time I get a
thing that's like,

00:17:40.990 --> 00:17:43.610
sign this and fax it
back, it's like, OK well

00:17:43.610 --> 00:17:46.720
you're going to get that
back in about 11 weeks

00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:47.970
when I get around to it.

00:17:47.970 --> 00:17:49.290
I can't stand it.

00:17:52.220 --> 00:17:55.130
There's plenty of
things I hate, like I've

00:17:55.130 --> 00:17:57.130
done shows about US currency.

00:17:57.130 --> 00:17:58.360
I don't like US currency.

00:17:58.360 --> 00:18:01.150
I would redesign US currency.

00:18:01.150 --> 00:18:05.550
I think our passports
are really fucking ugly.

00:18:05.550 --> 00:18:11.760
Which is all that eagle
and wavy, I don't know.

00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:13.270
Just like, give it up, guys.

00:18:13.270 --> 00:18:14.580
It's too much.

00:18:14.580 --> 00:18:15.820
You know?

00:18:15.820 --> 00:18:17.120
I am proud, too.

00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:18.262
I love America.

00:18:18.262 --> 00:18:19.862
I really, really do.

00:18:19.862 --> 00:18:22.262
But let's just try other things.

00:18:22.262 --> 00:18:24.720
LOGAN URY: You're now on some
sort of list for saying that.

00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:26.178
ROMAN MARS: I know
I'm on the list.

00:18:26.178 --> 00:18:27.332
On the list.

00:18:27.332 --> 00:18:29.415
LOGAN URY: So now I want
to ask you some questions

00:18:29.415 --> 00:18:31.140
just about podcasts in general.

00:18:31.140 --> 00:18:33.990
I read that you listen
to over 50 podcasts.

00:18:33.990 --> 00:18:36.370
What's the best podcast
that we're not currently

00:18:36.370 --> 00:18:38.004
listening to?

00:18:38.004 --> 00:18:40.489
ROMAN MARS: Ooh.

00:18:40.489 --> 00:18:41.940
Well, I don't know.

00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:49.240
So I have this little
collective that I'm

00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:50.520
part of called Radiotopia.

00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:53.075
And so you have to
listen to all those.

00:18:56.590 --> 00:18:59.520
LOGAN URY: You can pitch
us onto Radiotopia ones.

00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:02.460
ROMAN MARS: Well, the
newest one in Radiotopia

00:19:02.460 --> 00:19:06.277
is one called "The
Illusionist" by Helen Zaltzman.

00:19:06.277 --> 00:19:07.360
LOGAN URY: Some fans here.

00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:11.210
ROMAN MARS: And Helen has done
this podcast called "Answer Me

00:19:11.210 --> 00:19:15.540
This" with Olly Mann for eight
years, and it's so funny.

00:19:15.540 --> 00:19:17.630
It makes me really,
really happy.

00:19:17.630 --> 00:19:22.450
And I was originally trying
to get "Answer Me This"

00:19:22.450 --> 00:19:25.750
in Radiotopia before we had
an idea that we were sticking

00:19:25.750 --> 00:19:30.700
to narrative story style shows.

00:19:30.700 --> 00:19:33.710
And so she started
this one on word usage

00:19:33.710 --> 00:19:36.240
and etymology called
"The Illusionist,"

00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:37.850
and I love that one.

00:19:37.850 --> 00:19:39.880
And so every other
week, it's "Answer

00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:41.630
Me This" or "The
Illusionist" and I always

00:19:41.630 --> 00:19:43.420
get to hear from Helen.

00:19:43.420 --> 00:19:47.040
And she's just a gem of
a human being and just

00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:48.360
really, really funny.

00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:50.830
Naturally great at everything.

00:19:50.830 --> 00:19:53.830
It's almost infuriating how
good she is at this stuff.

00:19:53.830 --> 00:19:57.170
But everyone should listen to
"The Illusionist" and "Answer

00:19:57.170 --> 00:19:57.740
Me This."

00:19:57.740 --> 00:19:59.664
Those are a couple favorites.

00:19:59.664 --> 00:20:01.580
LOGAN URY: So I've heard
you say that podcasts

00:20:01.580 --> 00:20:03.610
are more intimate than
listening to the radio.

00:20:03.610 --> 00:20:06.980
Can you talk more about that?

00:20:06.980 --> 00:20:09.740
ROMAN MARS: Well when
I started the show, one

00:20:09.740 --> 00:20:12.770
of things I liked
about it-- I've

00:20:12.770 --> 00:20:15.840
sound designed a
lot of radio shows,

00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:19.660
and there was something about
the format of the podcasting,

00:20:19.660 --> 00:20:23.930
and the subjects and
my low-key style.

00:20:26.740 --> 00:20:32.540
I loved the miking.

00:20:32.540 --> 00:20:35.160
You might say, oh, you sound
different than you normally

00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:36.000
do on the show.

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:39.690
It's like, well, I mike the
show really close to my face,

00:20:39.690 --> 00:20:41.800
so it'd be like, "This is 99%."

00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:43.360
I talk lower.

00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:47.820
My point is I'm
trying to be-- I want

00:20:47.820 --> 00:20:52.640
to have the voice that you hear
of yourself inside your head.

00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:54.490
Because I'm doing
this thing where

00:20:54.490 --> 00:20:57.450
I'm trying to be your guide
through the world, and I

00:20:57.450 --> 00:21:00.640
think that that requires
that intimate connection.

00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:02.410
And so I was very
conscious of that

00:21:02.410 --> 00:21:04.500
when I was creating the show.

00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:13.450
And you put these things in
your head and I'm right there.

00:21:13.450 --> 00:21:16.290
And I know I feel that
connection to the people

00:21:16.290 --> 00:21:17.950
that I listen to, so
I wanted to create

00:21:17.950 --> 00:21:21.084
that intimate space with
the people who listen to me.

00:21:21.084 --> 00:21:21.750
LOGAN URY: Yeah.

00:21:21.750 --> 00:21:23.110
I thought it was really
interesting, because I've

00:21:23.110 --> 00:21:25.860
noticed when I watch TV
shows on my laptop in my bed,

00:21:25.860 --> 00:21:29.610
I feel really close
to Don Draper.

00:21:29.610 --> 00:21:31.810
And then on TV I'm like,
oh, they're so far away.

00:21:31.810 --> 00:21:35.730
It's just a different experience
of experiencing media.

00:21:35.730 --> 00:21:38.140
So what's your dream for
the future of podcasts?

00:21:40.810 --> 00:21:43.919
ROMAN MARS: Probably that
they won't be called podcasts.

00:21:43.919 --> 00:21:45.710
LOGAN URY: Should we
rename them right now?

00:21:45.710 --> 00:21:48.470
ROMAN MARS: Oh, no, I've
tried for years at this point.

00:21:48.470 --> 00:21:49.630
I've kind of given up.

00:21:49.630 --> 00:21:53.607
At this point, I've accepted
that I'm a podcaster.

00:21:53.607 --> 00:21:55.190
But sometimes when
I say it, I'll say,

00:21:55.190 --> 00:21:58.270
"I'm a podcaster," like that.

00:21:58.270 --> 00:22:00.780
Just because that
somehow is how I feel.

00:22:00.780 --> 00:22:06.820
But recently I've
just come to accept

00:22:06.820 --> 00:22:09.470
that's the name
it's going to be.

00:22:09.470 --> 00:22:12.690
It's not a lesser form.

00:22:12.690 --> 00:22:15.390
In fact I think it's a
superior form at this point.

00:22:15.390 --> 00:22:18.270
And I don't know if
we can ever rename it.

00:22:18.270 --> 00:22:24.660
But my hope is that some
mechanism just makes it

00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:27.970
so there are these shows,
and you press a button,

00:22:27.970 --> 00:22:30.522
and the shows happen,
and that's it.

00:22:30.522 --> 00:22:31.980
LOGAN URY: I heard
you say you want

00:22:31.980 --> 00:22:34.080
a podcast button in the car.

00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:36.140
ROMAN MARS: Totally.

00:22:36.140 --> 00:22:40.820
My listening changed a lot when
I finally got a new enough car

00:22:40.820 --> 00:22:44.090
that the Bluetooth
syncs to the car.

00:22:44.090 --> 00:22:47.410
It just flips on, and
whatever's on your phone starts.

00:22:47.410 --> 00:22:51.310
And I haven't turned on
my radio in a long time.

00:22:51.310 --> 00:22:55.432
And I devote my life
to public radio.

00:22:55.432 --> 00:22:56.390
So that really changed.

00:22:56.390 --> 00:22:59.060
I think that was one
of those things that

00:22:59.060 --> 00:23:03.470
made podcasting pushed ahead.

00:23:03.470 --> 00:23:05.970
I think that the
critical mass of people

00:23:05.970 --> 00:23:08.190
with those types
of cars made it so

00:23:08.190 --> 00:23:11.110
that listening to whatever
was on your phone at the time

00:23:11.110 --> 00:23:14.070
became the thing that
you did all the time.

00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:21.330
My hope is that they just
feel like radio shows.

00:23:21.330 --> 00:23:23.120
So they feel like
pieces of entertainment.

00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:26.450
And nobody cares
about the provenance

00:23:26.450 --> 00:23:28.790
of how it was distributed,
or whether you signed up

00:23:28.790 --> 00:23:31.340
for an RSS feed, or whatever.

00:23:31.340 --> 00:23:32.840
LOGAN URY: So since
we're at Google,

00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:35.680
I wanted to ask you a few
questions about technology.

00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:37.630
So with today's
technology, and people

00:23:37.630 --> 00:23:40.322
walking around with headphones,
and staring at their screens,

00:23:40.322 --> 00:23:41.780
do you think people
are interacting

00:23:41.780 --> 00:23:46.217
less with the buildings around
them and their environment?

00:23:46.217 --> 00:23:47.300
ROMAN MARS: I mean, maybe.

00:23:47.300 --> 00:23:48.383
I'm pretty guilty of that.

00:23:48.383 --> 00:23:51.000
I have my earphones
in most of the time,

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:54.390
so I don't listen as
much as I used to.

00:23:54.390 --> 00:23:58.050
But I feel like people
are more engaged and more

00:23:58.050 --> 00:24:00.160
design-aware than ever.

00:24:02.850 --> 00:24:05.900
My conceit always is that
the story of a design

00:24:05.900 --> 00:24:08.420
is more important than the
aesthetics of the design.

00:24:08.420 --> 00:24:10.090
And because you
have the back story

00:24:10.090 --> 00:24:13.930
of everything at
your fingertips,

00:24:13.930 --> 00:24:18.410
the world gets more into you.

00:24:18.410 --> 00:24:22.310
Like you get when you get a
good story about something.

00:24:22.310 --> 00:24:24.230
You begin to fall in
love with these things

00:24:24.230 --> 00:24:25.490
and these structures.

00:24:25.490 --> 00:24:28.520
And I think that's often
what the phone provides.

00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:30.770
I mean maybe if you're on
Twitter, you don't get that,

00:24:30.770 --> 00:24:35.220
but if you're engaged
and looking stuff up.

00:24:35.220 --> 00:24:38.490
That's the way I operate in
my screen world is looking

00:24:38.490 --> 00:24:41.480
up little things all the time.

00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:43.620
And that does make
me more engaged.

00:24:43.620 --> 00:24:47.010
And then the other thing is
I take pictures of things

00:24:47.010 --> 00:24:50.740
all the time, which reminds
me of my thoughts, which

00:24:50.740 --> 00:24:53.050
is important.

00:24:53.050 --> 00:24:56.490
And you could say, why
don't you just use your eyes

00:24:56.490 --> 00:25:00.450
instead of always using a lens?

00:25:00.450 --> 00:25:03.609
But to me I feel like I get the
right balance of that stuff.

00:25:03.609 --> 00:25:05.400
LOGAN URY: Well, it's
an interesting point.

00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:07.830
It's almost like because
we've had Google for a while,

00:25:07.830 --> 00:25:09.521
we know we can ask
those questions.

00:25:09.521 --> 00:25:11.520
So if we see something
that sparks our interest,

00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:14.640
there's an immediate way
to get the answer to that.

00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:16.880
So it changes,
maybe, how we think.

00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:18.820
ROMAN MARS: It does.

00:25:18.820 --> 00:25:21.260
But I think that there's
an expectation that there's

00:25:21.260 --> 00:25:24.850
a story for everything, and that
you can find it pretty easily.

00:25:24.850 --> 00:25:27.130
And I think that when you
think about the stories

00:25:27.130 --> 00:25:31.190
behind things, they're
more meaningful.

00:25:31.190 --> 00:25:36.380
LOGAN URY: What scares you about
technology or Google right now?

00:25:36.380 --> 00:25:37.090
ROMAN MARS: Ooh.

00:25:37.090 --> 00:25:38.590
Let's do something
about technology.

00:25:42.410 --> 00:25:43.120
I don't know.

00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:45.630
I think that when it
runs into a friction

00:25:45.630 --> 00:25:52.100
with me, personally, is when
somebody who we work with,

00:25:52.100 --> 00:25:59.430
they want to introduce some
kind of metric which I want

00:25:59.430 --> 00:26:02.840
to be my own creative thought.

00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:10.420
I don't want to be told I have
to put something in my show

00:26:10.420 --> 00:26:14.210
within nine seconds or
someone's going to skip it.

00:26:14.210 --> 00:26:15.910
LOGAN URY: Oh, like analytics.

00:26:15.910 --> 00:26:19.920
ROMAN MARS: Yeah, I'll rub up
against that technologically a

00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:20.834
little bit.

00:26:20.834 --> 00:26:23.000
But it's not that I think
that those things are bad.

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:25.750
I think those things are
good, but I don't always

00:26:25.750 --> 00:26:32.700
want to be subject to them
when I'm making things.

00:26:32.700 --> 00:26:37.160
I get this a lot with-- so we
started having ads on the show,

00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:38.290
to support the show.

00:26:38.290 --> 00:26:41.820
And I always put them all
at the end of the show.

00:26:44.490 --> 00:26:49.170
And these days as podcast
things exploded and stuff,

00:26:49.170 --> 00:26:52.180
it's really common to have
pre-rolls and mid-rolls, which

00:26:52.180 --> 00:26:55.610
are ads in the middle or
at the very beginning.

00:26:55.610 --> 00:26:57.980
And just aesthetically,
this is not my bag.

00:26:57.980 --> 00:27:00.922
I just don't want to do it.

00:27:00.922 --> 00:27:03.130
I listen to plenty of them
with it, and I don't mind,

00:27:03.130 --> 00:27:04.760
but it's just not my thing.

00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:10.780
But the whenever we
talk to an advertiser

00:27:10.780 --> 00:27:14.460
I get hit with this like,
well, in-the-show ads

00:27:14.460 --> 00:27:17.260
do this well, and the
[INAUDIBLE] and this well.

00:27:17.260 --> 00:27:19.100
And I was like, you
don't understand.

00:27:19.100 --> 00:27:22.210
My people stay for
my ads, usually.

00:27:22.210 --> 00:27:22.850
It's different.

00:27:22.850 --> 00:27:24.390
LOGAN URY: Well, you make
them really personal.

00:27:24.390 --> 00:27:25.560
ROMAN MARS: That's the idea.

00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:27.200
I do them different.

00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:30.250
But it's hard to
argue the analytics,

00:27:30.250 --> 00:27:31.510
because they're right.

00:27:31.510 --> 00:27:33.780
But I'm right, too.

00:27:36.024 --> 00:27:37.440
So those are the
things that I run

00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:39.370
against in
technology, where they

00:27:39.370 --> 00:27:40.620
have good facts on their side.

00:27:40.620 --> 00:27:42.560
It's not that they're wrong.

00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:44.020
I feel like I'm the exception.

00:27:44.020 --> 00:27:47.977
Which I guess everybody feels
like they're the exception.

00:27:47.977 --> 00:27:49.560
LOGAN URY: So you
have that experience

00:27:49.560 --> 00:27:51.480
where you see later
how popular a show was,

00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:53.445
and you're like, but
that show was so great.

00:27:53.445 --> 00:27:55.480
It should have been
more popular than that.

00:27:55.480 --> 00:27:57.210
Why did this one
perform this way?

00:27:57.210 --> 00:27:59.696
ROMAN MARS: Yeah,
and every once in a

00:27:59.696 --> 00:28:04.807
while I get a feeling about one
of them, but you never know.

00:28:04.807 --> 00:28:07.140
LOGAN URY: What's the most
popular when you've ever run?

00:28:10.524 --> 00:28:11.940
ROMAN MARS: It's
kind of anecdotal

00:28:11.940 --> 00:28:15.472
but I would say this
one called "Heyoon" was

00:28:15.472 --> 00:28:16.680
one of the more popular ones.

00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:20.830
It's about Alex Goldman,
who works on a show called

00:28:20.830 --> 00:28:23.380
"Reply All" now.

00:28:23.380 --> 00:28:24.930
It's about this
sort of secret place

00:28:24.930 --> 00:28:27.940
that he went to as a
teenager in Ann Arbor.

00:28:27.940 --> 00:28:29.830
And it was extremely personal.

00:28:29.830 --> 00:28:33.954
There wasn't a
lot of fact in it.

00:28:33.954 --> 00:28:35.370
I mean, all of it
was true, but it

00:28:35.370 --> 00:28:38.070
wasn't me trying to teach
you something about whatever.

00:28:40.890 --> 00:28:42.950
And I was a little nervous
about it, actually.

00:28:42.950 --> 00:28:45.860
I wasn't sure it
was going to work.

00:28:45.860 --> 00:28:47.860
But I think because it
was different, because it

00:28:47.860 --> 00:28:50.470
was personal, it stood out.

00:28:50.470 --> 00:28:52.480
It was the tall
flower in that case.

00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:54.744
And then people really
gravitated towards it.

00:28:54.744 --> 00:28:56.160
I think if I did
that type of show

00:28:56.160 --> 00:28:59.520
every week, people
would not like it,

00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:02.260
but that one does well.

00:29:02.260 --> 00:29:05.960
The one about Citicorp
tower nearly blowing over,

00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:06.920
that does well.

00:29:11.610 --> 00:29:13.930
But there will be ones
that are like-- we

00:29:13.930 --> 00:29:15.980
did this one for a long time.

00:29:15.980 --> 00:29:19.860
Julia Barton brought me this
one about the port of Dallas,

00:29:19.860 --> 00:29:22.630
the idea of turning Dallas
into a port city which

00:29:22.630 --> 00:29:25.940
is 300 miles inland.

00:29:25.940 --> 00:29:29.560
And I was deeply concerned
that was way too wonky.

00:29:29.560 --> 00:29:33.650
Way too weird and wonky a
process, and bureaucracy,

00:29:33.650 --> 00:29:35.950
and hydrology.

00:29:35.950 --> 00:29:37.830
And I just was
like, listen, guys.

00:29:37.830 --> 00:29:39.560
I don't know about this.

00:29:39.560 --> 00:29:43.970
And then people kind
of love that one.

00:29:43.970 --> 00:29:47.000
You get in the right space and
people will nerd out with you

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:49.650
for the most part.

00:29:49.650 --> 00:29:52.640
We make them for us,
and I think we've

00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:54.390
built enough of a
relationship with people

00:29:54.390 --> 00:29:57.405
that they'll come along with us
for the ride most of the time.

00:29:57.405 --> 00:29:59.780
LOGAN URY: That's how I felt
about the billiards episode.

00:29:59.780 --> 00:30:01.090
I was like, I trust you.

00:30:01.090 --> 00:30:02.777
Let's see where this goes.

00:30:02.777 --> 00:30:03.610
ROMAN MARS: Exactly.

00:30:03.610 --> 00:30:07.300
And for a long time
we were debating

00:30:07.300 --> 00:30:11.944
where to put the reveal
about plastics in it,

00:30:11.944 --> 00:30:14.110
because we had first scrubbed
it from the beginning,

00:30:14.110 --> 00:30:15.940
and we put it really late.

00:30:15.940 --> 00:30:18.610
And then we decided
to put it back.

00:30:18.610 --> 00:30:22.282
And that was Katie and Dan.

00:30:22.282 --> 00:30:24.250
We went back and
forth on that one.

00:30:24.250 --> 00:30:26.230
Because it's hard
to figure out what's

00:30:26.230 --> 00:30:28.125
going to make it
relevant to people.

00:30:28.125 --> 00:30:30.242
LOGAN URY: I think it worked.

00:30:30.242 --> 00:30:31.950
So what are some
stories about technology

00:30:31.950 --> 00:30:33.366
that you're
interested in telling?

00:30:37.780 --> 00:30:46.610
ROMAN MARS: Well, Sam's working
on this piece about automation

00:30:46.610 --> 00:30:49.350
in general, and what it means.

00:30:49.350 --> 00:30:52.445
The first automatic doors
and what kind of anxiety

00:30:52.445 --> 00:30:52.945
they caused.

00:30:56.270 --> 00:30:58.160
And I was trying to
talk to your car people,

00:30:58.160 --> 00:30:59.600
but they wouldn't talk to me.

00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:05.242
So if you're
listening, I remember.

00:31:13.170 --> 00:31:16.010
So it started out with
we got a pitch-- I don't

00:31:16.010 --> 00:31:17.190
know if I should tell you.

00:31:17.190 --> 00:31:18.650
When is that piece coming out?

00:31:18.650 --> 00:31:19.858
I don't I'm going to ruin it.

00:31:19.858 --> 00:31:25.950
But we had a pitch about these
old trains in Buenos Aires.

00:31:25.950 --> 00:31:29.000
And you had to
manually open them.

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:31.690
And this woman
from the states, it

00:31:31.690 --> 00:31:34.440
caused her great
anxiety anticipating

00:31:34.440 --> 00:31:36.895
being the person up front
who had to open the door.

00:31:39.530 --> 00:31:42.030
And we theorized,
which is backed up

00:31:42.030 --> 00:31:44.990
by a lot of newspaper
reports, that the opposite

00:31:44.990 --> 00:31:47.359
happened when automatic doors
were actually introduced.

00:31:47.359 --> 00:31:48.900
That you've got a
lot of anxiety when

00:31:48.900 --> 00:31:53.380
you're walking up to a door,
waiting for it to do its thing.

00:31:53.380 --> 00:31:55.870
But she felt great
performance anxiety

00:31:55.870 --> 00:31:57.140
when she had to open the door.

00:31:57.140 --> 00:31:57.980
I feel the same way.

00:31:57.980 --> 00:32:01.620
If I'm in line for a fast food
place or something like that,

00:32:01.620 --> 00:32:04.180
practice my order, because
I'm like, can't mess up!

00:32:04.180 --> 00:32:07.437
I've got to get this right.

00:32:07.437 --> 00:32:10.020
LOGAN URY: Are you the guy who
opts out of sitting in the exit

00:32:10.020 --> 00:32:10.695
row?

00:32:10.695 --> 00:32:12.070
ROMAN MARS: No,
no, I'll do that.

00:32:12.070 --> 00:32:13.030
That'll be fine.

00:32:13.030 --> 00:32:15.620
But if it involves
people waiting then

00:32:15.620 --> 00:32:17.790
I get really nervous
and anxious about that.

00:32:17.790 --> 00:32:20.060
But I was really
interested in that idea.

00:32:20.060 --> 00:32:24.690
And especially the
weird brackish water

00:32:24.690 --> 00:32:28.140
in automation, where
the sink is automated,

00:32:28.140 --> 00:32:30.689
but they have to pump the soap.

00:32:30.689 --> 00:32:32.230
And things like that
where it's like,

00:32:32.230 --> 00:32:36.270
when did we decide which
ones, and what works,

00:32:36.270 --> 00:32:37.310
and what doesn't work?

00:32:37.310 --> 00:32:39.579
And so that was what was
swimming around in our heads.

00:32:39.579 --> 00:32:41.870
LOGAN URY: How did you feel
about the Google bathrooms?

00:32:41.870 --> 00:32:44.670
ROMAN MARS: It seemed
to work just fine.

00:32:44.670 --> 00:32:46.385
Everything was automated.

00:32:46.385 --> 00:32:48.010
LOGAN URY: So I have
two more questions

00:32:48.010 --> 00:32:50.040
and then I'll open it
up to the audience.

00:32:50.040 --> 00:32:53.470
So this is kind of random,
but if you could recommend

00:32:53.470 --> 00:32:55.640
one class that all American
high schoolers would

00:32:55.640 --> 00:32:58.185
have to take, what would it be?

00:32:58.185 --> 00:32:59.810
ROMAN MARS: Some kind
of history class.

00:33:03.240 --> 00:33:06.740
I knew I wanted to be
a scientist so young

00:33:06.740 --> 00:33:11.730
that I opted out of every
elective until my junior year.

00:33:11.730 --> 00:33:13.830
I took modern European history.

00:33:13.830 --> 00:33:16.160
And I was like, oh,
man, I should have

00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:19.050
been doing this the whole time.

00:33:19.050 --> 00:33:21.270
And that's why some
kind of history class

00:33:21.270 --> 00:33:26.287
with a good professor, who
can really tell great stories.

00:33:26.287 --> 00:33:27.870
Because that's really
what it's about.

00:33:27.870 --> 00:33:31.392
But history is my big one.

00:33:31.392 --> 00:33:33.350
LOGAN URY: Oh, I just
remembered the other one.

00:33:33.350 --> 00:33:36.020
If you could put a line
under the Google homepage

00:33:36.020 --> 00:33:39.620
for one day-- we have the Google
Doodles and those things-- what

00:33:39.620 --> 00:33:42.720
would you want to say?

00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:44.124
ROMAN MARS: I have no idea.

00:33:46.844 --> 00:33:48.260
LOGAN URY: It's a
lot of pressure.

00:33:48.260 --> 00:33:49.120
ROMAN MARS: It's
a lot of pressure!

00:33:49.120 --> 00:33:50.670
LOGAN URY: OK, you
can get back to me.

00:33:50.670 --> 00:33:51.461
ROMAN MARS: Please.

00:33:51.461 --> 00:33:55.980
LOGAN URY: And finally,
as a podcast insider,

00:33:55.980 --> 00:33:57.060
tell us the truth.

00:33:57.060 --> 00:34:00.189
Did Adnan do it?

00:34:00.189 --> 00:34:01.730
ROMAN MARS: Should
I really say this?

00:34:01.730 --> 00:34:03.570
LOGAN URY: What do you think?

00:34:03.570 --> 00:34:04.295
ROMAN MARS: Yeah.

00:34:04.295 --> 00:34:06.060
LOGAN URY: You think he did it?

00:34:06.060 --> 00:34:09.360
ROMAN MARS: Well, yeah, I do.

00:34:09.360 --> 00:34:10.719
OK, so I listen to that show.

00:34:10.719 --> 00:34:11.719
LOGAN URY: Can we
just have the audience

00:34:11.719 --> 00:34:13.497
who thinks he did
it raise your hand?

00:34:13.497 --> 00:34:15.080
AUDIENCE: Can you
repeat the question?

00:34:15.080 --> 00:34:16.621
LOGAN URY: From the
podcast "Serial."

00:34:16.621 --> 00:34:18.120
ROMAN MARS: Did Adnan do it?

00:34:18.120 --> 00:34:19.170
Here's the deal.

00:34:22.780 --> 00:34:27.679
I got no impression from
the show either way.

00:34:27.679 --> 00:34:30.210
Women are killed by their
boyfriends or husbands.

00:34:30.210 --> 00:34:32.574
That is almost a
certain a fact as there

00:34:32.574 --> 00:34:35.650
is any fact in this world
when it comes to murder.

00:34:35.650 --> 00:34:42.088
And so I'm resting on that, when
I have no other information.

00:34:42.088 --> 00:34:42.754
LOGAN URY: Cool.

00:34:42.754 --> 00:34:45.584
I'll take your word for it.

00:34:45.584 --> 00:34:47.750
So now we'll open up to
questions from the audience,

00:34:47.750 --> 00:34:50.650
and we have a lovely
volunteer and his dog.

00:34:50.650 --> 00:34:53.280
We're going to come to you
so if you have a question,

00:34:53.280 --> 00:34:55.690
raise your hand, and we'll
bring the mic to you.

00:34:55.690 --> 00:34:57.439
AUDIENCE: I do a little
bit of podcasting.

00:34:57.439 --> 00:35:00.350
So my name is Salim, and I work
here at Google doing training

00:35:00.350 --> 00:35:03.091
for our partner network, and
we're looking at different ways

00:35:03.091 --> 00:35:04.090
to deliver the training.

00:35:04.090 --> 00:35:06.550
And the thing I like
about the podcast format

00:35:06.550 --> 00:35:09.554
is all the tools anybody
can use, I mean, the podcast

00:35:09.554 --> 00:35:10.720
and it goes to their device.

00:35:10.720 --> 00:35:12.420
It's [INAUDIBLE] on a phone.

00:35:12.420 --> 00:35:15.310
Whereas our other training, you
have to actually be connected.

00:35:15.310 --> 00:35:16.770
So we're trying this new format.

00:35:16.770 --> 00:35:21.320
And my idea was just, well, the
content is so important to me,

00:35:21.320 --> 00:35:23.380
but my colleague who
helped build this--

00:35:23.380 --> 00:35:27.070
I don't know if he
can hear me-- I said,

00:35:27.070 --> 00:35:29.150
well, we should
have a show page.

00:35:29.150 --> 00:35:30.900
And I love the show
page that he designed.

00:35:30.900 --> 00:35:34.330
It's great to use
as a marketing tool.

00:35:34.330 --> 00:35:35.856
I said, this is
what I'm working on.

00:35:35.856 --> 00:35:37.720
But I feel bad
about the show page,

00:35:37.720 --> 00:35:39.130
because it's not the content.

00:35:39.130 --> 00:35:41.821
It's the podcast that
I want them to go to.

00:35:41.821 --> 00:35:43.570
And I want them to go
in the device, which

00:35:43.570 --> 00:35:46.420
means the show page
is kind of secondary,

00:35:46.420 --> 00:35:48.590
because I want them--
and I'm OK with that.

00:35:48.590 --> 00:35:51.000
Just, why do we spend so
much time on the show page?

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:53.410
Can you tell me some design
tips on the show page?

00:35:53.410 --> 00:35:55.330
ROMAN MARS: I'm with
you on this one,

00:35:55.330 --> 00:36:01.770
in the sense that for the
longest time-- until Sam came--

00:36:01.770 --> 00:36:04.430
the show page for a
certain episode was like,

00:36:04.430 --> 00:36:05.670
we did a show about this.

00:36:05.670 --> 00:36:06.570
Listen to it.

00:36:06.570 --> 00:36:07.605
It was nothing.

00:36:07.605 --> 00:36:09.720
It was some random picture.

00:36:09.720 --> 00:36:12.790
I didn't care all that
much, because the idea

00:36:12.790 --> 00:36:15.750
was that we were making--
the radio show was the show.

00:36:19.040 --> 00:36:21.120
Quickly I learned
that a lot of people

00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:24.657
rely on the website to
fill in the visual images

00:36:24.657 --> 00:36:26.240
that they were
conjuring in their head

00:36:26.240 --> 00:36:27.781
when they were
listening to the show.

00:36:27.781 --> 00:36:29.745
And so find that useful.

00:36:33.620 --> 00:36:38.230
And more and more
I've been thinking

00:36:38.230 --> 00:36:41.070
that there are
stories to be told

00:36:41.070 --> 00:36:44.790
which might not be podcasts.

00:36:44.790 --> 00:36:48.860
But recently, like in
the past couple years,

00:36:48.860 --> 00:36:50.510
I get tweets from
people that say,

00:36:50.510 --> 00:36:53.140
this seems like a "99%
Invisible" story more and more.

00:36:53.140 --> 00:36:56.540
Like we were owning
an idea of how to view

00:36:56.540 --> 00:36:59.670
the world through design.

00:36:59.670 --> 00:37:04.070
And so I've been thinking more
and more that we would actually

00:37:04.070 --> 00:37:07.060
build out the website to include
some of those things that

00:37:07.060 --> 00:37:10.090
might not be radio shows.

00:37:10.090 --> 00:37:13.370
So I'm starting to
convert to the idea

00:37:13.370 --> 00:37:16.080
that the web page
is more important,

00:37:16.080 --> 00:37:18.310
but in the beginning,
the worst thing--

00:37:18.310 --> 00:37:20.629
AUDIENCE: But your
podcast can be video.

00:37:20.629 --> 00:37:22.170
That's what I love
about the podcast.

00:37:22.170 --> 00:37:23.990
It could be video or audio.

00:37:23.990 --> 00:37:26.320
And with the end
user's tool, they

00:37:26.320 --> 00:37:29.472
can tell us, no, I only
want to see the video.

00:37:29.472 --> 00:37:30.180
ROMAN MARS: Yeah.

00:37:30.180 --> 00:37:33.860
I don't know how to make video,
which is why we do audio.

00:37:33.860 --> 00:37:36.630
AUDIENCE: So just to
further on your question,

00:37:36.630 --> 00:37:38.350
you said the visual image.

00:37:38.350 --> 00:37:40.740
So what do you recommend?

00:37:40.740 --> 00:37:46.190
Because I always try to think
of what is the listener?

00:37:46.190 --> 00:37:48.140
So I interview a
lot of people, and I

00:37:48.140 --> 00:37:50.090
try to channel what
kind of questions

00:37:50.090 --> 00:37:51.870
I'd ask, just like
yourself today,

00:37:51.870 --> 00:37:54.510
so that people don't get
a chance to ask questions.

00:37:54.510 --> 00:37:56.340
Because that's the format.

00:37:56.340 --> 00:37:58.190
How do you come
up with the visual

00:37:58.190 --> 00:38:00.610
that I could take back with me?

00:38:00.610 --> 00:38:03.645
ROMAN MARS: The visual,
like in my scripts?

00:38:03.645 --> 00:38:05.520
AUDIENCE: Yeah, like
the visual that you will

00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:08.610
have on the show page, yeah.

00:38:08.610 --> 00:38:11.250
You just said to put a
visual on your show page.

00:38:11.250 --> 00:38:13.350
ROMAN MARS: The visual
on the show page.

00:38:13.350 --> 00:38:14.900
Because we cover
physical objects,

00:38:14.900 --> 00:38:16.858
you just have a picture
of the physical object.

00:38:16.858 --> 00:38:21.240
I mean that's our
thing, so that's easier.

00:38:21.240 --> 00:38:23.620
When you're describing
visual things on the radio,

00:38:23.620 --> 00:38:25.320
you either have to
be exactly right,

00:38:25.320 --> 00:38:27.278
or you have to tell a
story in which it doesn't

00:38:27.278 --> 00:38:28.870
matter if you're exactly right.

00:38:28.870 --> 00:38:31.690
And we usually
lean on the latter,

00:38:31.690 --> 00:38:34.150
that you don't have to
picture it perfectly

00:38:34.150 --> 00:38:35.910
to tell the right story.

00:38:35.910 --> 00:38:38.930
And my thing with the website
is I hope it's a tool.

00:38:38.930 --> 00:38:40.190
I'm glad people go to it.

00:38:40.190 --> 00:38:42.850
When we redesigned it,
a lot more people did.

00:38:42.850 --> 00:38:47.120
But if you ever tell me
you came to the website

00:38:47.120 --> 00:38:53.490
and didn't listen to the radio
show, I will be upset with you.

00:38:53.490 --> 00:38:55.540
AUDIENCE: That was a good segue.

00:38:55.540 --> 00:38:58.070
One of the things
I like about design

00:38:58.070 --> 00:39:01.150
is that it's often determined by
the constraints that you have.

00:39:01.150 --> 00:39:03.891
And I'm interested in-- I
was listening to the startup

00:39:03.891 --> 00:39:05.890
podcast, and one of the
things they talked about

00:39:05.890 --> 00:39:06.940
was adding technology.

00:39:06.940 --> 00:39:09.620
Like you can push a
picture to your phone.

00:39:09.620 --> 00:39:12.730
And I'm interested in how much
you appreciate the constraint

00:39:12.730 --> 00:39:15.340
of only being able
to talk, and how much

00:39:15.340 --> 00:39:18.420
you're interested
in other multimedia

00:39:18.420 --> 00:39:21.440
ways of describing things.

00:39:21.440 --> 00:39:23.880
ROMAN MARS: Yeah, I love
the constraint of it.

00:39:23.880 --> 00:39:26.890
I think, in the
beginning especially,

00:39:26.890 --> 00:39:30.870
the joy of doing an
audio-only show about design,

00:39:30.870 --> 00:39:35.140
like the perversity of that
just gave me so much joy.

00:39:35.140 --> 00:39:40.840
Because it allowed
me to pick up stories

00:39:40.840 --> 00:39:44.162
that-- a lot of the
design press, especially.

00:39:44.162 --> 00:39:46.620
It's been different recently,
but especially five years ago

00:39:46.620 --> 00:39:49.510
when the show started,
was everything new

00:39:49.510 --> 00:39:53.230
and shiny on a nice
white background

00:39:53.230 --> 00:39:55.690
and how beautiful a thing was.

00:39:55.690 --> 00:39:59.020
And when you don't have
to worry about that,

00:39:59.020 --> 00:40:02.250
it opens up the things
you can talk about.

00:40:02.250 --> 00:40:04.050
And so I really love that.

00:40:04.050 --> 00:40:09.670
And I love the idea that
I could talk about flags,

00:40:09.670 --> 00:40:14.070
or the design of language,
or the design of queues,

00:40:14.070 --> 00:40:19.520
and have it all fit under the
umbrella of "99% Invisible."

00:40:19.520 --> 00:40:23.670
And I think a function of
that is because we're telling

00:40:23.670 --> 00:40:25.150
the stories only through audio.

00:40:25.150 --> 00:40:30.980
They're just as real in front of
you as these physical objects.

00:40:30.980 --> 00:40:32.630
So I love that stuff.

00:40:32.630 --> 00:40:39.030
When I'm free to have visuals,
it really throws me off.

00:40:39.030 --> 00:40:42.939
We've been working
on a video forever.

00:40:42.939 --> 00:40:44.480
I don't know if
we'll ever finish it.

00:40:44.480 --> 00:40:48.460
I hope we will someday, but
it's just really hard for me

00:40:48.460 --> 00:40:52.071
to have no constraints
in that way.

00:40:52.071 --> 00:40:55.450
The other thing I like
about telling design stories

00:40:55.450 --> 00:41:00.640
with audio is a lot of people
have a real distinct opinion,

00:41:00.640 --> 00:41:03.610
especially when they see
a building or something.

00:41:03.610 --> 00:41:05.245
A lot of people hate modernism.

00:41:05.245 --> 00:41:08.306
A lot of people have
a real reaction to it.

00:41:08.306 --> 00:41:10.180
But if I can tell you
the story of a building

00:41:10.180 --> 00:41:13.340
before you see it, I
can make you love it,

00:41:13.340 --> 00:41:18.550
even if your general perception
of that is that it's ugly.

00:41:18.550 --> 00:41:22.060
I love having that power.

00:41:22.060 --> 00:41:23.940
So in a way it's a
constraint, but I think

00:41:23.940 --> 00:41:25.310
that it's a real powerful mode.

00:41:25.310 --> 00:41:28.100
If you're the only
stimulus, it's

00:41:28.100 --> 00:41:32.630
only your words that are
painting the picture of it,

00:41:32.630 --> 00:41:34.610
you can make it
whatever you want.

00:41:34.610 --> 00:41:37.130
You can make people
feel whatever they want.

00:41:37.130 --> 00:41:38.387
I love that part.

00:41:38.387 --> 00:41:39.220
AUDIENCE: Hi, Roman.

00:41:39.220 --> 00:41:40.220
Thanks for coming in.

00:41:40.220 --> 00:41:41.380
I'm a big fan.

00:41:41.380 --> 00:41:44.910
So I wanted to ask a little bit
about the tools that you use.

00:41:44.910 --> 00:41:46.970
So you mentioned you
use a condenser mic,

00:41:46.970 --> 00:41:50.030
and you make good use
of the proximity effect.

00:41:50.030 --> 00:41:52.290
So if you could describe
a little bit the signal

00:41:52.290 --> 00:41:54.120
flow, whether you use
compression or not.

00:41:54.120 --> 00:41:55.420
[INAUDIBLE].

00:41:55.420 --> 00:41:58.752
And also where the writing
actually takes place.

00:41:58.752 --> 00:41:59.710
Do you use Google Docs?

00:41:59.710 --> 00:42:02.464
Do you go use [INAUDIBLE]
for stuff like this?

00:42:02.464 --> 00:42:04.130
I would love to learn
a little bit more.

00:42:04.130 --> 00:42:05.430
ROMAN MARS: Yeah.

00:42:05.430 --> 00:42:16.300
So I mostly use a shotgun
mic and AT897 to track.

00:42:16.300 --> 00:42:21.040
It's not the prescribed
use, to do vocal voiceovers.

00:42:21.040 --> 00:42:21.960
It's the one I had.

00:42:24.800 --> 00:42:27.600
It was the one I had.

00:42:27.600 --> 00:42:29.220
It's one of the
reasons why it sounds

00:42:29.220 --> 00:42:31.700
so close is because I
mike it really close, off

00:42:31.700 --> 00:42:33.450
my face a little bit.

00:42:33.450 --> 00:42:38.610
And it's a shotgun mic
and a normal vocal.

00:42:38.610 --> 00:42:39.975
We write in Google Docs.

00:42:43.400 --> 00:42:46.880
We share in group.

00:42:46.880 --> 00:42:50.320
Once a person gets a certain
amount, they open it up.

00:42:50.320 --> 00:42:54.350
Especially Katie who-- she
only shares at a certain point

00:42:54.350 --> 00:42:56.290
because she has grading.

00:42:56.290 --> 00:42:58.310
If somebody can see
her typing poorly,

00:42:58.310 --> 00:43:01.310
she gets really
anxious about that.

00:43:01.310 --> 00:43:04.340
So she only shares it
after a certain point

00:43:04.340 --> 00:43:08.300
and then we work together
on the Google Doc.

00:43:08.300 --> 00:43:10.820
Even in a room, we'll
play the thing out loud

00:43:10.820 --> 00:43:13.770
and we're all making comments
in the comment stream.

00:43:17.320 --> 00:43:19.060
In the beginning, I
didn't use scripts.

00:43:19.060 --> 00:43:22.094
I mainly wrote on the fly.

00:43:22.094 --> 00:43:23.760
So in the beginning
when it was just me,

00:43:23.760 --> 00:43:30.050
I would have bullet points and
I would just play the clip,

00:43:30.050 --> 00:43:32.560
say what I was thinking, cut
it together in Pro Tools,

00:43:32.560 --> 00:43:35.300
and then write it in Pro Tools.

00:43:35.300 --> 00:43:37.210
In a way I could
write it in Pro Tools.

00:43:37.210 --> 00:43:39.600
And then if it didn't
work, or the breath was

00:43:39.600 --> 00:43:42.080
wrong or something, then
I'd re-perform the thing

00:43:42.080 --> 00:43:43.976
I cut together.

00:43:43.976 --> 00:43:45.600
And I used to call
that retroscripting.

00:43:45.600 --> 00:43:50.850
It was a way for it to sound
extemporaneous because it was.

00:43:50.850 --> 00:43:52.680
It was really me
reacting to the take.

00:43:52.680 --> 00:43:55.400
But it was tighter, and
I cut it and edited it,

00:43:55.400 --> 00:43:58.320
and I would just try it again
and again until I got it right.

00:43:58.320 --> 00:44:00.741
And so there were no
scripts in the beginning.

00:44:00.741 --> 00:44:02.740
But now when you have to
work with other people,

00:44:02.740 --> 00:44:04.520
you have to write
stuff down on paper.

00:44:04.520 --> 00:44:07.775
Or "paper."

00:44:07.775 --> 00:44:09.170
Yeah, is there anything else?

00:44:09.170 --> 00:44:10.385
And we'd work in Pro Tools.

00:44:10.385 --> 00:44:12.560
AUDIENCE: Just so you don't
have to use compression, EQ.

00:44:12.560 --> 00:44:13.268
ROMAN MARS: Yeah.

00:44:13.268 --> 00:44:22.340
So I use basic compression
inside of Pro Tools for me.

00:44:22.340 --> 00:44:25.340
I have a booming
middle, so I drop down

00:44:25.340 --> 00:44:29.490
the mid-range of my
voice so you can hear me

00:44:29.490 --> 00:44:31.910
over music or stuff.

00:44:31.910 --> 00:44:33.742
Sometimes I forget.

00:44:33.742 --> 00:44:35.700
So sometimes if you notice
it, and you're like,

00:44:35.700 --> 00:44:37.890
you sound really muddy and
when you're driving in a car

00:44:37.890 --> 00:44:40.181
I can't hear your voice at
all because it's all rumbly.

00:44:40.181 --> 00:44:42.612
But that's because I
didn't cut down the middle.

00:44:45.410 --> 00:44:46.610
Yeah, that's about it.

00:44:46.610 --> 00:44:47.610
We don't do a lot.

00:44:47.610 --> 00:44:51.760
A little bit of max and a
little bit of compression.

00:44:51.760 --> 00:44:53.177
LOGAN URY: Let's
pass it this way.

00:44:53.177 --> 00:44:54.760
AUDIENCE: I think
it's interesting how

00:44:54.760 --> 00:44:57.610
many of these questions were
about the mechanics of creating

00:44:57.610 --> 00:44:58.510
podcasts.

00:44:58.510 --> 00:45:00.430
Would you ever consider
creating something

00:45:00.430 --> 00:45:03.450
like Radiotopia University?

00:45:03.450 --> 00:45:06.700
It could even be as simple as
the list you just gave here.

00:45:06.700 --> 00:45:09.490
ROMAN MARS: Yeah, I mean,
other people are doing it well.

00:45:09.490 --> 00:45:12.050
So right when I
started in radio,

00:45:12.050 --> 00:45:14.740
a website started
called transom.org.

00:45:14.740 --> 00:45:17.220
It's still going strong and
they had put a lot of stuff

00:45:17.220 --> 00:45:18.095
out about podcasting.

00:45:18.095 --> 00:45:21.390
I just feel like
other people are

00:45:21.390 --> 00:45:25.950
doing a pretty good job of it.

00:45:25.950 --> 00:45:27.971
I get asked it a lot.

00:45:27.971 --> 00:45:29.470
I haven't done them
in a few months,

00:45:29.470 --> 00:45:31.760
but I used to do these
things called office hours.

00:45:31.760 --> 00:45:35.494
I had a hard time fielding all
the emails from people starting

00:45:35.494 --> 00:45:36.910
podcasts and various
other things,

00:45:36.910 --> 00:45:39.950
and so I just was like,
well, I'll be at this cafe

00:45:39.950 --> 00:45:41.300
from 2:00 to 4:00.

00:45:41.300 --> 00:45:43.660
Show up with your questions.

00:45:43.660 --> 00:45:46.305
And so I know there's a lot
of people really interested,

00:45:46.305 --> 00:45:47.970
and there'd be
some way to do it.

00:45:47.970 --> 00:45:50.840
But I've just never had the
time to commit all that stuff.

00:45:50.840 --> 00:45:51.780
It's totally true.

00:45:51.780 --> 00:45:54.200
It's people ask
that all the time.

00:45:54.200 --> 00:45:57.950
What mic do you use and all that
stuff is really, really common,

00:45:57.950 --> 00:46:00.384
so I'm always happy when
other people handle it for me.

00:46:00.384 --> 00:46:01.800
AUDIENCE: I just
think of the page

00:46:01.800 --> 00:46:04.300
that you used to have of these
are the podcasts I listen to.

00:46:04.300 --> 00:46:06.860
And I found some of the best
experiences I've had that way.

00:46:06.860 --> 00:46:08.820
So even a little one pager.

00:46:08.820 --> 00:46:10.200
ROMAN MARS: I probably could.

00:46:10.200 --> 00:46:11.050
I do have one.

00:46:11.050 --> 00:46:12.260
It's in the FAQ.

00:46:12.260 --> 00:46:13.700
It's like, what
is your equipment?

00:46:13.700 --> 00:46:17.260
And it mentions the
AT897 and the PCM-D50,

00:46:17.260 --> 00:46:20.450
the recorder I track
into, and Pro Tools.

00:46:20.450 --> 00:46:23.450
The thing is for the most
part, none of this stuff--

00:46:23.450 --> 00:46:25.030
it isn't complicated.

00:46:25.030 --> 00:46:27.410
And it isn't exactly hard.

00:46:27.410 --> 00:46:30.220
You just have to do it a
lot until it feels good.

00:46:30.220 --> 00:46:35.350
And you'll know when your
podcast or your radio story

00:46:35.350 --> 00:46:36.895
is good.

00:46:36.895 --> 00:46:39.011
You feel different about it.

00:46:39.011 --> 00:46:41.260
You just play it out loud
for people, and you'll know.

00:46:41.260 --> 00:46:46.990
When I hear a piece, and
when I know the bad parts is,

00:46:46.990 --> 00:46:51.599
I get really hot around my
head, and my ears get red.

00:46:51.599 --> 00:46:53.640
I'll be like, oh, God,
I've got to cut that part.

00:46:53.640 --> 00:46:55.390
That was terrible.

00:46:55.390 --> 00:46:57.727
So play your work
for other people.

00:46:57.727 --> 00:46:59.060
That's usually the secret to it.

00:46:59.060 --> 00:47:00.800
The equipment's irrelevant.

00:47:00.800 --> 00:47:02.680
You can talk into a
micro set recorder.

00:47:02.680 --> 00:47:04.570
It'll be fine.

00:47:04.570 --> 00:47:07.780
AUDIENCE: You mentioned early
on walking around campus here.

00:47:07.780 --> 00:47:10.860
And I would be curious to
hear your take, from a design

00:47:10.860 --> 00:47:15.510
architecture perspective, on
the Google campus as it is,

00:47:15.510 --> 00:47:17.660
or if you're at all
familiar with some

00:47:17.660 --> 00:47:21.840
of the plans Google has released
about the next generation.

00:47:21.840 --> 00:47:24.640
ROMAN MARS: I'm not
especially familiar.

00:47:24.640 --> 00:47:26.860
I've read very basic articles.

00:47:26.860 --> 00:47:28.450
I don't have them
committed to memory,

00:47:28.450 --> 00:47:30.800
I can tell you that much.

00:47:30.800 --> 00:47:34.660
The main thing, I'm not
an architecture critic,

00:47:34.660 --> 00:47:39.120
so I don't tend to have
this initial strong reaction

00:47:39.120 --> 00:47:40.530
to places.

00:47:40.530 --> 00:47:46.490
What I react to is, how do
people feel in the environment?

00:47:46.490 --> 00:47:49.300
So that's what I
interview people about.

00:47:49.300 --> 00:47:52.510
So it's less of a question for
me as it is a question for you.

00:47:52.510 --> 00:47:54.290
It's how you feel
when you're here.

00:47:57.460 --> 00:48:00.800
When I'm here, I guess
I feel a little lost,

00:48:00.800 --> 00:48:03.035
but I can get used
to it probably.

00:48:05.532 --> 00:48:07.740
LOGAN URY: Can you talk a
little bit about the plaque

00:48:07.740 --> 00:48:08.945
that you took a picture of?

00:48:08.945 --> 00:48:09.820
That was interesting.

00:48:09.820 --> 00:48:10.528
ROMAN MARS: Yeah.

00:48:10.528 --> 00:48:13.165
So this is another story
that we were thinking of.

00:48:13.165 --> 00:48:14.570
I'd have to look it up.

00:48:14.570 --> 00:48:19.700
But right through the
main Googleplex area,

00:48:19.700 --> 00:48:24.200
it must have some kind of
a requirement to be open.

00:48:24.200 --> 00:48:27.530
Because there's a
little Title 1080

00:48:27.530 --> 00:48:29.680
plaque the very
start of the stairs

00:48:29.680 --> 00:48:33.469
which is a statement
that basically says,

00:48:33.469 --> 00:48:35.010
this is supposed to
be a passthrough,

00:48:35.010 --> 00:48:36.910
and you can pass through
it if you want to.

00:48:36.910 --> 00:48:40.550
But if you're sleeping
on the sidewalk,

00:48:40.550 --> 00:48:42.590
we get to kick you out,
that kind of thing.

00:48:42.590 --> 00:48:47.654
That's what that Title 1008 is.

00:48:47.654 --> 00:48:49.570
And so I took a picture
of that, because I was

00:48:49.570 --> 00:48:50.736
kind of surprised to see it.

00:48:50.736 --> 00:48:53.490
You see it a lot
if you're downtown.

00:48:53.490 --> 00:48:55.490
There's a building
with a passthrough,

00:48:55.490 --> 00:48:57.530
and you're allowed to
walk through there.

00:48:57.530 --> 00:48:58.910
It's not private.

00:48:58.910 --> 00:49:02.970
It's slightly public space.

00:49:02.970 --> 00:49:04.410
So yeah, you have that here.

00:49:04.410 --> 00:49:07.634
I was really
intrigued to see that.

00:49:07.634 --> 00:49:10.570
I don't know why that
just came up, but anyway.

00:49:10.570 --> 00:49:11.140
I don't know.

00:49:11.140 --> 00:49:13.340
What is your
impression of Google?

00:49:13.340 --> 00:49:20.410
AUDIENCE: I think
the move to-- I

00:49:20.410 --> 00:49:22.950
live in San Francisco,
an like many employees.

00:49:22.950 --> 00:49:26.450
And I think one of the things I
noticed most coming down here,

00:49:26.450 --> 00:49:29.050
as you move from an
urban environment,

00:49:29.050 --> 00:49:32.880
where it's many people
with different agendas

00:49:32.880 --> 00:49:39.821
and interests mixing, to a very
nice, but somewhat set apart.

00:49:39.821 --> 00:49:42.070
ROMAN MARS: Well if you're
talking about the big scale

00:49:42.070 --> 00:49:45.050
stuff about creating a
hermetically sealed campus.

00:49:45.050 --> 00:49:47.610
I think there's dangers to that
not having outside influence

00:49:47.610 --> 00:49:49.530
and not being integrated
into the community.

00:49:49.530 --> 00:49:52.820
And I think you
feel that over time.

00:49:52.820 --> 00:49:55.280
I think there's
dangers of what that

00:49:55.280 --> 00:50:00.280
can do to you, like the
employee-employer relationship.

00:50:00.280 --> 00:50:04.844
I don't know what they do to
you, or what they make you do.

00:50:04.844 --> 00:50:06.510
But there's dangers
of that because when

00:50:06.510 --> 00:50:13.640
you get sequestered, like
when you're in college,

00:50:13.640 --> 00:50:15.450
you feel everything more.

00:50:15.450 --> 00:50:18.280
Because you're on this campus,
you feel the rage more.

00:50:18.280 --> 00:50:19.470
You feel the injustice more.

00:50:19.470 --> 00:50:23.120
You feel weird
slights about things.

00:50:23.120 --> 00:50:24.530
You feel it more.

00:50:24.530 --> 00:50:29.010
Maybe if you were
integrated into a city,

00:50:29.010 --> 00:50:30.840
it would have less
of that effect.

00:50:30.840 --> 00:50:36.260
And I always warn
people, when you

00:50:36.260 --> 00:50:41.340
take a job where they have
laundry facilities, that

00:50:41.340 --> 00:50:45.800
means they want you to be
there instead of at home doing

00:50:45.800 --> 00:50:46.610
your laundry.

00:50:46.610 --> 00:50:48.660
And so that's a choice.

00:50:48.660 --> 00:50:52.200
Sometimes that seems like
an awesome choice to me.

00:50:52.200 --> 00:50:57.140
But sometimes probably
it's not a good choice.

00:50:57.140 --> 00:51:00.840
So the environment
reflects those values.

00:51:00.840 --> 00:51:02.724
So it's just part of it.

00:51:02.724 --> 00:51:04.140
AUDIENCE: First
of all, thank you.

00:51:04.140 --> 00:51:07.880
We're on a shuttle for three
or four or five hours a day,

00:51:07.880 --> 00:51:13.320
and it's entertaining to listen
to you uncover these stories.

00:51:13.320 --> 00:51:15.195
But I was just
curious how much do

00:51:15.195 --> 00:51:20.320
you hold the concept of "99%
Invisible" to the stories

00:51:20.320 --> 00:51:22.700
that you guys create?

00:51:22.700 --> 00:51:26.260
Do you sometimes find yourself
saying, well, that's 20%?

00:51:26.260 --> 00:51:28.780
ROMAN MARS: Is 99
invisible enough?

00:51:28.780 --> 00:51:31.720
Yeah, I don't.

00:51:31.720 --> 00:51:34.610
We don't measure against
that sort of thing.

00:51:34.610 --> 00:51:36.320
AUDIENCE: Well,
because it very often

00:51:36.320 --> 00:51:39.030
seems like you're the guy
that reads the plaques

00:51:39.030 --> 00:51:42.110
and finds the stories
in the plaques.

00:51:42.110 --> 00:51:46.860
Do you ever find yourself
vetting the concept

00:51:46.860 --> 00:51:50.970
against some of the stories
that you're coming up with?

00:51:50.970 --> 00:51:54.660
ROMAN MARS: Yeah, a little bit.

00:51:54.660 --> 00:51:58.860
They're design stories
that are stories.

00:51:58.860 --> 00:52:01.090
We call them "dude
with a project"

00:52:01.090 --> 00:52:03.950
stories, which are cool
things that someone

00:52:03.950 --> 00:52:06.930
does that solves a problem.

00:52:06.930 --> 00:52:09.410
But it really
doesn't help you view

00:52:09.410 --> 00:52:11.030
the world in any different way.

00:52:11.030 --> 00:52:12.720
It just is interesting.

00:52:12.720 --> 00:52:16.470
And that to me is the equivalent
of arts reporting, of like,

00:52:16.470 --> 00:52:17.365
here's a good band.

00:52:17.365 --> 00:52:20.720
I want to tell you
about that band.

00:52:20.720 --> 00:52:23.590
I like the ones where
when you're done with it,

00:52:23.590 --> 00:52:26.300
you decode the world
in a different way.

00:52:26.300 --> 00:52:28.700
And that's usually what the
secret sauce that puts it

00:52:28.700 --> 00:52:30.577
over the edge for a
"99% Invisible" story.

00:52:30.577 --> 00:52:32.535
It doesn't have to be
the most invisible thing.

00:52:32.535 --> 00:52:35.820
In fact, for the most part, what
I love is the really obvious

00:52:35.820 --> 00:52:38.090
and ubiquitous things, and
going, no, wait a minute.

00:52:38.090 --> 00:52:39.050
Pay attention.

00:52:39.050 --> 00:52:41.760
There's an interesting
parts to this thing.

00:52:41.760 --> 00:52:44.860
Those are actually my
favorite types of stories.

00:52:44.860 --> 00:52:48.070
AUDIENCE: OK, so you've gone
from podcasting at night

00:52:48.070 --> 00:52:50.825
to making a full time job to now
creating business with a team.

00:52:50.825 --> 00:52:53.720
I think that's mainly through
the power of Kickstarter.

00:52:53.720 --> 00:52:55.487
ROMAN MARS: It's
one of them, yeah.

00:52:55.487 --> 00:52:56.820
AUDIENCE: I've been a supporter.

00:52:56.820 --> 00:53:00.115
ROMAN MARS: Yeah, no,
I appreciate that.

00:53:00.115 --> 00:53:01.740
AUDIENCE: And through
Radiotopia you're

00:53:01.740 --> 00:53:03.365
now giving that chance
to other people.

00:53:03.365 --> 00:53:06.090
Do you see the Kickstarter
and Patreon patronage model

00:53:06.090 --> 00:53:09.090
letting more people pursue their
artistic passion that same way

00:53:09.090 --> 00:53:11.137
and turning into
a job or something

00:53:11.137 --> 00:53:13.720
that they can support them, or
how do you see that developing?

00:53:13.720 --> 00:53:15.178
ROMAN MARS: Yeah,
well, Kickstarter

00:53:15.178 --> 00:53:16.800
was hugely important to me.

00:53:16.800 --> 00:53:21.220
I mean to me at the beginning
it was a means to an end.

00:53:21.220 --> 00:53:24.620
I needed money to survive or
it wasn't going to happen.

00:53:24.620 --> 00:53:26.590
The show wasn't going to exist.

00:53:26.590 --> 00:53:28.890
But what I didn't know,
because the first Kickstart

00:53:28.890 --> 00:53:33.720
took off in such a way and it
became the biggest journalism

00:53:33.720 --> 00:53:35.180
Kickstart at the time.

00:53:35.180 --> 00:53:37.440
And then we did again,
and became bigger.

00:53:40.010 --> 00:53:42.410
It became a story
in and of itself.

00:53:42.410 --> 00:53:51.680
And a lot of it was the vanguard
of a lot of this podcast,

00:53:51.680 --> 00:53:53.220
like resurgence at the time.

00:53:53.220 --> 00:53:57.950
I mean Alex Blumberg,
who does Gimlet,

00:53:57.950 --> 00:54:01.570
has very generously cited
me as some kind of influence

00:54:01.570 --> 00:54:04.110
in making his thing.

00:54:04.110 --> 00:54:08.280
It's not entirely true, but
he's sweet about that stuff.

00:54:08.280 --> 00:54:11.840
But realizing that you could
form a tight connection

00:54:11.840 --> 00:54:14.320
with your audience, and
they would value you

00:54:14.320 --> 00:54:17.470
more than the radio stations
we used to make things for

00:54:17.470 --> 00:54:21.390
was a huge deal to
us as producers.

00:54:21.390 --> 00:54:24.620
And for the first time,
because of that connection,

00:54:24.620 --> 00:54:28.570
because of that ability
to fund directly,

00:54:28.570 --> 00:54:33.550
radio producers like
myself are able to get by.

00:54:33.550 --> 00:54:38.740
And it was really touch-and-go
there for a while.

00:54:38.740 --> 00:54:43.700
I was really trying to leave
radio about seven years ago,

00:54:43.700 --> 00:54:45.490
right after the kids were born.

00:54:45.490 --> 00:54:48.180
I did everything in my
power to leave radio,

00:54:48.180 --> 00:54:52.660
because it just seemed like a
selfish choice for my family.

00:54:52.660 --> 00:54:57.030
And so Kickstarter was just
a huge game changer for me.

00:54:57.030 --> 00:54:58.780
I owe them everything.

00:54:58.780 --> 00:55:02.180
I think it's one of the
most interesting disruptive

00:55:02.180 --> 00:55:06.910
technologies, to overuse
an overused term, that's

00:55:06.910 --> 00:55:08.530
available.

00:55:08.530 --> 00:55:11.970
And it was super important
to creative people like me.

00:55:11.970 --> 00:55:16.010
LOGAN URY: I think it's nice
to end on a point of gratitude.

00:55:16.010 --> 00:55:17.800
Thank you so much for coming.

00:55:17.800 --> 00:55:20.250
ROMAN MARS: Thank you so much.
