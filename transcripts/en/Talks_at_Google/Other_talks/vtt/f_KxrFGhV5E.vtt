00:00:01.699 --> 00:00:02.699
[applause]

00:00:02.699 --> 00:00:06.859
&gt;&gt;Teresa Amabile: Thank you so much.

00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:08.149
I'm really delighted to be here.

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:09.210
And please don't feel shy.

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:10.420
Come on down in front.

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:13.260
I'd love to have people sitting down close.

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:18.930
I get a lot of energy from being able to talk
to you in this way.

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:24.500
I'm really excited to be here and to be able
to share with you some, what I think, are

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.140
some fairly surprising results from our recent
research.

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.230
The basic research question is a pretty simple
one.

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:36.770
What makes people happy, motivated, productive,
and creative at work?

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:41.820
Now obviously, this is a pretty important
question because presumably, we all want to

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.330
be happy and motivated at work.

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:48.420
And our organizations want us to be creative
and productive.

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.140
But the answer to this question really isn't
very simple at all.

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.560
For one thing, do these even go together?

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:57.720
Think about the prototypical starving artist.

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:05.059
Do happiness and creativity work in the same
direction or might they work in opposition?

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:06.520
Another question about this.

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:11.259
Should managers care how happy people are
at work?

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:14.450
And also, what influences any of these?

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:16.539
Take creativity for example.

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:20.659
People have been wondering about creativity
at least since the time of Plato.

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:27.030
I, myself, have been studying creativity since
I was about five years old.

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.030
Really.

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:29.030
True.

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.049
At least, that's the first time I remember
hearing the word "creativity."

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:38.859
I was in kindergarten and I overheard my kindergarten
teacher tell my mother, "I think Teresa shows

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:43.560
a lot of potential for artistic creativity
and I hope that's something she really develops

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:44.829
over the years."

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:46.889
I was ecstatic when I heard this.

00:01:46.889 --> 00:01:52.950
I don't think I really knew what creativity
meant, but it sounded good.

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.700
I was glad I had it.

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.369
And I was looking forward to a lifetime as
a creative artist.

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:06.479
Well, unfortunately, that kindergarten year
was the high point of artistic career.

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:07.479
[laughter]

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:12.150
I really have never done anything with art
after that, and I've often thought about why.

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.720
What is it that happened to that promised
artistic creativity?

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.209
As I look back on it, I think it might have
had something to do with the kind of day by

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:25.019
day experiences that I had with art in those
years following.

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:30.739
So, kindergarten was in a very progressive,
open-school kind of situation where we had

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:36.550
a lot of free play time and a lot of access
to these wonderful art materials all day.

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:41.909
The following year, my parents enrolled me
in a very strict, traditional, parochial school.

00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:43.630
There it is.

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:46.599
St. Joe's Elementary in North Tonawanda, New
York.

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:48.560
Doesn't that look like a lot of fun?

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:49.560
[laughter]

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:57.450
So, at St. Joe's, art, rather than being something
that we did all the time every day, art became

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.219
a subject that we had once a week.

00:03:00.219 --> 00:03:04.470
And every week, we got the same, pretty bizarre
activity given to us.

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:09.909
We were each given a small reprint of one
the great masterworks in painting and we were

00:03:09.909 --> 00:03:11.900
asked to copy it.

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:18.730
So, this is something that we got in Second
Grade--da Vinci's Adoration of the Magi.

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:24.069
And we were told to copy this with absolutely
no skill training and with material that looked

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:26.129
pretty much like this.

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:27.129
[laughter]

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:30.069
This was obviously an exercise in frustration.

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:35.200
And what's more, we were really strictly graded
on these monstrosities we produced.

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:36.360
Mine were true monstrosities.

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:41.909
I couldn't even figure out how to get all
those horses and Saints on the page, let alone

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:43.849
make them look like horses and Saints.

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:51.400
And there was only one time in all those years
in school that I heard the word "creative."

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.090
I decided to do something interpretive on
this particular day.

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:57.530
I was doing something abstract during art.

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:59.989
And I heard the nun walking up the aisle.

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:04.930
And then, I noticed that she stopped by my
desk and she was looking down at me.

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:10.739
And then I heard her say, "I think maybe we're
being a little too creative."

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:12.739
[laughter]

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:14.760
I was mortified when she said this.

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:15.760
I was embarrassed.

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:17.030
I was angry.

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:20.660
I looked at her as being a cruel person.

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:22.750
I saw myself as being ridiculous.

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:27.310
And I certainly lost all of my motivation
at that point for doing anything with art.

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:33.260
It was like the last straw in my drive to
do anything with art as a kid.

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:41.310
Now, in an adult at work, I would call that
kind of reaction "poor inner work life."

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:43.860
Let me show you what I mean by inner work
life.

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:51.070
It's the combination of perceptions, emotions,
and motivations that people experience at

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:57.020
they're reacting to and trying to make sense
of the events going on in their work day.

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:59.860
So, inner work life consists of perceptions.

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:04.760
That is, your thoughts, impressions, your
judgments about the place where you work,

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:10.200
your co-workers, your bosses, the work that
you're doing--even yourself as an employee.

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:12.420
So, those are your perceptions.

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:17.920
It's also your motivations, your emotions
and your emotional reactions to what's happening

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:18.920
with what's going on.

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:21.920
And also, you're general mood on a given day.

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:24.630
And it's your motivation for doing the work.

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:30.470
And we found that the most important motivation
for creativity is what we call "intrinsic

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:31.650
motivation."

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:35.640
And that's your passion for doing what you're
doing, your drive to do it because you find

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:40.730
it interesting, exciting, because you're personally
challenged by it.

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:47.830
So this complex of psychological experiences
are inner work life.

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:51.740
Inner work life is called "inner" because
it's mostly hidden.

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:53.500
Let me give you an example of this.

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:58.960
Have you ever been in a business meeting with
higher status people?

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:05.690
When one of those people says something so
outrageous that you're momentarily stunned--I

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:08.760
see some heads nodding--I think many of us
had had that experience.

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:11.860
So, did you say what you were thinking?

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:14.370
If you're like me and most people, you didn't.

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:19.090
Do you let it show on your face?

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:22.210
If you're like me, you did something like
this.

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:23.210
[laughter]

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:27.620
When, in fact, you wanted to react by saying,
"What?

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:30.340
What did you just say?"

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:32.580
So, it's really hidden away.

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:37.160
Co-workers are often not aware on inner work
life and bosses certainly aren't aware of

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:41.180
it, especially if the reaction is negative.

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:42.340
But does it matter?

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:48.410
Does it really matter what people's innermost
thoughts, feelings, are at work?

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:50.071
In short, you bet it does.

00:06:50.071 --> 00:06:51.460
It matters a lot.

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:56.570
In fact, inner work life is a central construct
in our research.

00:06:56.570 --> 00:07:00.740
It matters a great deal for the work that
people do and it matters for the people doing

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:01.740
that work.

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:06.540
I'm going to illustrate the importance of
inner work life by telling you two contrasting

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:08.430
stories of two companies from our research.

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:12.000
I think of these companies in Dickensonian
terms.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.950
The best of time and the worst of times.

00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:23.520
Because the worst company, in terms of employee
engagement and actual success, was like the

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:29.160
evil twin of the best company in our research,
because these two companies were oddly similar

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:31.280
before we started our research.

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:33.270
They were both very well-known companies.

00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:35.810
I can't tell you the real names, by the way.

00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:40.550
I'm gonna use disguise names because we have
some pretty confidential information on them.

00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:47.330
Very well-known companies, very profitable
and known as the innovative leaders in their

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:48.330
industries.

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:49.960
I'm gonna start with the worst.

00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:53.810
And it's a company that we call "Karpenter
Corporation."

00:07:53.810 --> 00:07:57.820
It's one of the best-known consumer products
brands in the world.

00:07:57.820 --> 00:08:02.790
Imagine that you're standing with your co-workers
in the parking lot of the building where you

00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:03.790
work.

00:08:03.790 --> 00:08:09.890
And you're watching silently as the contents
of that building are being auctioned off--your

00:08:09.890 --> 00:08:16.740
computers, CADs, work stations, your desks,
your telephones.

00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:19.560
Your chairs are being auctioned off.

00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:23.830
You used to be proud to work for this particular
company because it was known for its really

00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:27.000
cool innovative products.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:31.620
But the last few years, innovation began to
fizzle, profitability tanked.

00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:39.450
The company was acquired by a smaller rival
and now it's being completely closed down.

00:08:39.450 --> 00:08:42.430
And it's breaking your heart.

00:08:42.430 --> 00:08:44.730
That's the story of Karpenter Corporation.

00:08:44.730 --> 00:08:50.470
And it's the story of the demise of one of
the great consumer products companies of the

00:08:50.470 --> 00:08:52.570
20th Century.

00:08:52.570 --> 00:08:55.490
Now, let me tell you about the best of times.

00:08:55.490 --> 00:08:59.560
A company that we call "O'Reilly Coated Materials."

00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:05.020
This company makes coated fabrics for weather-proof
clothing and a wide variety of other products

00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:06.970
that are known around the world.

00:09:06.970 --> 00:09:12.190
We studied Karpenter and O'Reilly at roughly
the same time period.

00:09:12.190 --> 00:09:16.280
And they actually use a lot of the same raw
materials, so the economic conditions for

00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:18.610
these two companies were pretty similar.

00:09:18.610 --> 00:09:24.880
And yet, Karpenter lies dead and O'Reilly
is still at the top of its industry and is

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:27.110
still known as the innovative leader.

00:09:27.110 --> 00:09:32.181
So, what made the difference between these
two companies that looked so similar at one

00:09:32.181 --> 00:09:34.440
point?

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:39.460
My research team and I studied these companies
in real time in great detail and I can tell

00:09:39.460 --> 00:09:41.130
you what it's not.

00:09:41.130 --> 00:09:45.940
It's not any of these things because the two
companies were the same, essentially, on all

00:09:45.940 --> 00:09:48.050
of these aspects.

00:09:48.050 --> 00:09:49.370
Both public companies.

00:09:49.370 --> 00:09:51.630
Both had similar incentive systems.

00:09:51.630 --> 00:09:55.400
Because they were so well-known, they were
able to hire the cream of the crop in their

00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:59.890
disciplines, highly-skilled employees, and
we had personality profiles on people in these

00:09:59.890 --> 00:10:00.890
companies.

00:10:00.890 --> 00:10:02.150
And there were no differences.

00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:06.580
The personality profiles were in the normal
range.

00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:12.460
So, my co-author, Steve Kramer, and I are
both psychologists.

00:10:12.460 --> 00:10:17.900
We're not the kind of psychologists who can
cure your neurosis for you, but we are able

00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:23.030
to give you a view of what really happens
inside organizations.

00:10:23.030 --> 00:10:28.800
And when we took this deep look into these
companies, we realized that what really differentiated

00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:34.279
them was inner work life--the inner work life
experiences that their employees were having

00:10:34.279 --> 00:10:36.210
day by day.

00:10:36.210 --> 00:10:41.930
So it turns out that shortly before we started
our study, a new management team had come

00:10:41.930 --> 00:10:43.740
in at Karpenter.

00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:52.870
And by what they said and did every day, they
slowly changed the climate at Karpenter.

00:10:52.870 --> 00:10:56.480
And they essentially poisoned inner work life.

00:10:56.480 --> 00:11:02.150
And this is something that we saw happening
day by day.

00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:09.490
So, let me tell you a little something about
how we got our look at inner work life.

00:11:09.490 --> 00:11:11.840
It is hidden most of the time.

00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:18.110
We decided that the best way to get a window
into what was really going on was to ask people

00:11:18.110 --> 00:11:26.850
working on creative projects to send us daily
confidential electronic diaries describing

00:11:26.850 --> 00:11:32.920
what had gone on for them in their own work
experience that day and what their inner work

00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:35.290
life was like for that day.

00:11:35.290 --> 00:11:39.440
So that's what we did--daily, confidential,
electronic diaries.

00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:47.670
We studied three industries in this entire
project, a total of seven companies in these

00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:50.780
industries, 26 creative project teams.

00:11:50.780 --> 00:11:52.880
These are projects that required creativity.

00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:58.760
They required innovative solutions in order
to be done successfully.

00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:04.100
In these 26 creative project teams, we had
a total of 238 professionals participating

00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:06.630
in the research.

00:12:06.630 --> 00:12:10.471
Because they participated every day during
the entire course of the project they were

00:12:10.471 --> 00:12:18.390
working on, we amassed a total of nearly 12
thousand daily diary reports, which we were

00:12:18.390 --> 00:12:19.390
able to analyze.

00:12:19.390 --> 00:12:23.230
This was a real treasure trove of data for
us.

00:12:23.230 --> 00:12:25.210
We had numerical data.

00:12:25.210 --> 00:12:30.730
We actually had day by day scale ratings from
these people of what their inner work life

00:12:30.730 --> 00:12:35.180
was like--their perceptions, their emotions,
and their motivation.

00:12:35.180 --> 00:12:38.960
We also had numerical data on their performance.

00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:45.310
Quite apart from their diaries, we had performance
ratings by co-workers and supervisors throughout

00:12:45.310 --> 00:12:48.420
the entire course of the time that we were
studying these people.

00:12:48.420 --> 00:12:50.210
And we actually had behavioral measures, too.

00:12:50.210 --> 00:12:52.730
I'll tell you a little bit more about that
in just a minute.

00:12:52.730 --> 00:12:57.750
To me, the most interesting part of the daily
diaries were the stories that we got about

00:12:57.750 --> 00:12:58.860
people's days.

00:12:58.860 --> 00:13:05.020
So, at the end of the diary form, we asked
a question: "Briefly describe one event from

00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:08.310
today that stands out in your mind from the
work day.

00:13:08.310 --> 00:13:12.800
It can be anything at all."

00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:18.350
These stories were incredibly rich, often
very detailed accounts of something that had

00:13:18.350 --> 00:13:21.760
actually happened that day in these people's
work lives.

00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:28.130
Let me give you an example of some of these
diaries that we got.

00:13:28.130 --> 00:13:32.760
This first one is from a product manager at
Karpenter Corporation named Sophie.

00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:36.150
That's what we call her anyway.

00:13:36.150 --> 00:13:41.850
This was one of Sophie's worst days during
the time that we were studying Karpenter Corporation.

00:13:41.850 --> 00:13:47.060
She said, "I don't understand why R&amp;D kills
so many of my projects, yet I'm supposedly

00:13:47.060 --> 00:13:49.520
measured on new product development.

00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:55.330
The VP of R&amp;D killed my new hand-held mixer
three times before it was approved a couple

00:13:55.330 --> 00:13:56.960
weeks ago.

00:13:56.960 --> 00:14:03.830
Very conflicting goals causing us to start,
stop, restart, etc."

00:14:03.830 --> 00:14:06.020
This really was a worst day for Sophie.

00:14:06.020 --> 00:14:11.500
Her intrinsic motivation on this day was over
two and a half standard deviations below her

00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:13.350
own baseline.

00:14:13.350 --> 00:14:18.620
And her affect, her mood for the day, was
one and a half standard deviations below her

00:14:18.620 --> 00:14:20.589
own baseline.

00:14:20.589 --> 00:14:26.630
Now for contrast, this is a diary from someone
in O'Reilly Corporation, two thousand miles

00:14:26.630 --> 00:14:28.920
away, almost at exactly the same point in
time.

00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:33.050
This is a team leader named Dave.

00:14:33.050 --> 00:14:40.470
"Presented 1.5 hours’ worth of technical
data, market information, process capability

00:14:40.470 --> 00:14:44.180
and cost information in the project review.

00:14:44.180 --> 00:14:46.520
The review was very well-received.

00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:49.980
Much assistance was given and we passed.

00:14:49.980 --> 00:14:54.350
We were allowed to go on to the next stage."

00:14:54.350 --> 00:15:00.230
Dave's intrinsic motivation on this day was
almost one standard deviation above his average.

00:15:00.230 --> 00:15:03.940
And his mood for the day was one and a half
standard deviations above his average.

00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:06.050
So, this was a best day for Dave.

00:15:06.050 --> 00:15:11.020
And I could give you lots of examples just
like this from O'Reilly Corporation.

00:15:11.020 --> 00:15:16.290
I could also give you many examples like Sophie's
from Karpenter Corporation--many days where

00:15:16.290 --> 00:15:19.510
that kind of thing happened to a variety of
people.

00:15:19.510 --> 00:15:22.700
Now let me tell you something about how we
measured creativity.

00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:29.530
We got a quasi-behavioral measure by looking
at what people reported doing that day in

00:15:29.530 --> 00:15:30.530
their diary.

00:15:30.530 --> 00:15:33.910
Now, we didn't tell them that we were looking
for creativity, that we wanted them to tell

00:15:33.910 --> 00:15:36.230
us about their new ideas.

00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:41.440
In fact, we didn't even say that we were focusing
on creativity in this study.

00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:46.000
But if they happened to report that they came
up with a new idea on a given day, or that

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:52.330
they solved a complex problem, we counted
that as an example of creativity.

00:15:52.330 --> 00:15:54.110
So here's an example from a different company.

00:15:54.110 --> 00:15:55.630
This is a high-tech firm.

00:15:55.630 --> 00:15:58.410
This is from an engineer's diary.

00:15:58.410 --> 00:16:03.000
He said, "Working on the details of how the
image will be produced, I really got into

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:09.120
the problem and came up with an elegant method
for dealing with overloaded tasks."

00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:14.510
So when we put these creativity data and our
other performance data together with inner

00:16:14.510 --> 00:16:18.300
work life data, we made our first discovery.

00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:22.120
We call it the "inner work life effect."

00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:26.560
And that is that inner work life drives performance.

00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:32.680
We found that all three aspects of inner work
life--perceptions, emotions, and motivation--predict

00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:37.890
four dimensions of performance.

00:16:37.890 --> 00:16:44.290
When people have more positive perceptions
of their organization, their co-workers, their

00:16:44.290 --> 00:16:49.670
bosses, the work that they're doing, when
they have more pleasant emotions like feeling

00:16:49.670 --> 00:16:56.660
happy, feeling proud, and when they feel stronger
intrinsic motivation, on those days they're

00:16:56.660 --> 00:17:01.540
more likely to be creative, productive, committed
to the work, and they're likely to be better

00:17:01.540 --> 00:17:04.890
colleagues to the people around them.

00:17:04.890 --> 00:17:10.459
So for instance, one study that we did, we
found that when people had more positive emotions

00:17:10.459 --> 00:17:16.230
on one day, they were more likely to have
creative ideas that day.

00:17:16.230 --> 00:17:21.750
And not only that, they were more likely to
have creative ideas the following day.

00:17:21.750 --> 00:17:24.860
Even controlling for that next day's mood.

00:17:24.860 --> 00:17:32.850
So we found a carryover effect of positive
emotion on creative thinking.

00:17:32.850 --> 00:17:37.929
You could call this inner work life effect,
the Zappos effect.

00:17:37.929 --> 00:17:44.019
You're probably familiar with the fact that
Zappos has built this online commerce powerhouse

00:17:44.019 --> 00:17:49.580
in part, based on the happiness philosophy
of CEO, Tony Hsieh.

00:17:49.580 --> 00:17:55.360
He says, "We believe you can't have happy
customers unless you have happy employees."

00:17:55.360 --> 00:18:00.360
And there are a number of people who really
believe that the happiness philosophy is at

00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:05.899
least in part responsible for the very high-quality
work you see at Zappos from people, whether

00:18:05.899 --> 00:18:10.340
they're working in those call centers, taking
customer orders and dealing with customer

00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:13.590
issues, or whether they're working in the
bustling warehouses.

00:18:13.590 --> 00:18:18.750
So, this is an anecdote that supports the
inner work life effect we found.

00:18:18.750 --> 00:18:23.900
But there was another study that came out
just a few months ago that gives further support

00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:25.519
to the inner work life effect.

00:18:25.519 --> 00:18:28.210
These researchers used a very different methodology.

00:18:28.210 --> 00:18:34.330
They have survey data from over 140 thousand
employees in a variety of companies, business

00:18:34.330 --> 00:18:38.190
units, a variety of industries around the
world.

00:18:38.190 --> 00:18:45.190
They wanted to see what effect job satisfaction
and people's perceptions of their work environment,

00:18:45.190 --> 00:18:51.720
basically, what effect inner work life would
have on bottom line performance of the company.

00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:59.289
They found that when a business unit's employees
had higher levels of job satisfaction and

00:18:59.289 --> 00:19:05.129
more positive perceptions of their managers,
their co-workers, and their jobs, at one point

00:19:05.129 --> 00:19:11.600
in time, that business unit at a later point
in time was more likely to have higher sales

00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:17.830
growth, greater profitability, higher levels
of customer loyalty, and greater employee

00:19:17.830 --> 00:19:19.120
retention.

00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:20.710
So think about it.

00:19:20.710 --> 00:19:27.529
Inner work life leads to better bottom line
performance for companies.

00:19:27.529 --> 00:19:37.440
So, if inner work life drives performance--and
it does--what drives inner work life?

00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:43.090
We decided to take a look at this by isolating
the very best inner work life days from those

00:19:43.090 --> 00:19:50.620
12 thousand days of data that we had and understanding
what events actually happened on those days--categorizing

00:19:50.620 --> 00:19:52.710
the events, coding them.

00:19:52.710 --> 00:19:57.399
And contrasting the events on the best inner
work life days with those on the very worst

00:19:57.399 --> 00:19:58.960
inner work life days.

00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:06.029
And when we did this, we found that one kind
of event stood out on those best days.

00:20:06.029 --> 00:20:11.070
Simply, making progress in meaningful work.

00:20:11.070 --> 00:20:15.119
We call this the "progress principle."

00:20:15.119 --> 00:20:21.299
The number one driver of inner work life is
progress in meaningful work.

00:20:21.299 --> 00:20:24.470
And let me just say something about meaningful
work.

00:20:24.470 --> 00:20:28.609
To take a random example, people might find
it motivating to work for a company where

00:20:28.609 --> 00:20:34.970
the mission is to organize all of the world's
information and make it universally accessible

00:20:34.970 --> 00:20:37.929
and useful.

00:20:37.929 --> 00:20:42.739
And even if a company doesn't have such a
lofty goal, as long as people, as individuals,

00:20:42.739 --> 00:20:48.859
can see a connection between what they're
doing every day and something that they value,

00:20:48.859 --> 00:20:53.149
something that has a sense of purpose for
them, as long as that's true, then making

00:20:53.149 --> 00:20:58.269
progress can ignite their inner work lives.

00:20:58.269 --> 00:21:00.489
[pause]

00:21:00.489 --> 00:21:06.070
Interestingly, this can happen in a variety
of ways.

00:21:06.070 --> 00:21:11.710
Let me show you how prominent progress is
on the very best days at work.

00:21:11.710 --> 00:21:17.360
When people are feeling happiest, most intrinsically
motivated, and having the most positive perceptions

00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:22.739
about their work environment, progress dominates
all other events.

00:21:22.739 --> 00:21:28.240
It's by far the most common event on those
best days at work.

00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:29.970
Setbacks are the opposite of progress.

00:21:29.970 --> 00:21:33.970
And that means being blocked in the work in
some way, having obstacles, feeling that you're

00:21:33.970 --> 00:21:36.119
stalled or that you're actually moving backward.

00:21:36.119 --> 00:21:41.529
And setbacks were quite minimal on the best
days at work.

00:21:41.529 --> 00:21:46.200
The worst days at work are almost exactly
the opposite.

00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:47.960
Setbacks dominate on those days.

00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:50.370
They dwarf all other events.

00:21:50.370 --> 00:21:52.320
And progress is much less common.

00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:55.159
So, the progress principle isn't just about
progress.

00:21:55.159 --> 00:21:57.460
It's also about setbacks.

00:21:57.460 --> 00:22:02.249
As a pair of contrasting events, these two
are the number one differentiators between

00:22:02.249 --> 00:22:06.799
best and worst inner work life days.

00:22:06.799 --> 00:22:13.090
But the progress principle isn't only about
huge breakthroughs and devastating failures.

00:22:13.090 --> 00:22:20.980
One of our most surprising findings is that
even small events can have a huge impact on

00:22:20.980 --> 00:22:22.559
inner work life.

00:22:22.559 --> 00:22:30.179
Even making small, incremental steps forward
in the work can lead people to feel great.

00:22:30.179 --> 00:22:34.359
And we call this "the power of small wins."

00:22:34.359 --> 00:22:40.730
I'm gonna give you an example of this from
a diary of an engineer named Tom.

00:22:40.730 --> 00:22:45.279
This happened after he had finally defeated
a bug in some software that he was trying

00:22:45.279 --> 00:22:46.340
to create.

00:22:46.340 --> 00:22:51.440
He said, "I smashed that software bug that's
been frustrating me for almost a calendar

00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:53.019
week.

00:22:53.019 --> 00:22:56.999
That may not be an event to you, but I live
a very drab life.

00:22:56.999 --> 00:22:59.409
So, I'm all hyped.

00:22:59.409 --> 00:23:01.210
No one really knows about it.

00:23:01.210 --> 00:23:04.309
Three of the team members who had been involved
are out today.

00:23:04.309 --> 00:23:10.279
So, I have to sit here rejoicing in my solitary
smugness."

00:23:10.279 --> 00:23:17.889
Doesn't Tom sound happy there?

00:23:17.889 --> 00:23:24.460
We found that 28 percent of small events can
have a major impact on inner work life.

00:23:24.460 --> 00:23:25.460
Twenty-eight percent.

00:23:25.460 --> 00:23:30.059
There are a number of interesting things in
this diary of Tom's that I just read.

00:23:30.059 --> 00:23:34.399
First of all, Tom tells us about the causal
link.

00:23:34.399 --> 00:23:39.669
He doesn't just say that he made progress,
he defeated this bug and he felt good.

00:23:39.669 --> 00:23:43.070
He tells us that he felt good because he made
progress.

00:23:43.070 --> 00:23:47.919
And we saw this over and over again when people
reported making progress in their work.

00:23:47.919 --> 00:23:54.309
They said that they reacted very positively
to it.

00:23:54.309 --> 00:23:57.729
The other thing to notice is that this was
just a bug.

00:23:57.729 --> 00:24:01.619
In the grand scheme of Tom's work on this
project and the grand scheme of his professional

00:24:01.619 --> 00:24:04.980
life, it was no big deal.

00:24:04.980 --> 00:24:06.740
But it was.

00:24:06.740 --> 00:24:11.169
It was a big deal to him on the day that it
happened.

00:24:11.169 --> 00:24:14.289
Unfortunately, it operates in the negative
direction, too.

00:24:14.289 --> 00:24:19.369
So, small losses can have a pretty significant
negative impact on inner work life.

00:24:19.369 --> 00:24:25.159
And unfortunately, setbacks in the work have
a negative effect that's two to three times

00:24:25.159 --> 00:24:32.210
more powerful in the negative direction than
the positive effect of progress on inner work

00:24:32.210 --> 00:24:33.659
life.

00:24:33.659 --> 00:24:35.229
So there are a couple of implications here.

00:24:35.229 --> 00:24:41.249
One is, it's really important to try to minimize
inhibitors to progress, minimize things that

00:24:41.249 --> 00:24:43.409
can lead to setbacks in the work.

00:24:43.409 --> 00:24:50.899
Even, and maybe especially, minor daily hassles
in getting good work done.

00:24:50.899 --> 00:24:56.609
Another implication is that if you have big,
audacious goals for a project, which is great--it's

00:24:56.609 --> 00:25:02.210
wonderful to have goals like that--it's really
helpful to chunk those goals down into more

00:25:02.210 --> 00:25:09.970
meaningful pieces where people can get a more
frequent sense of achieving small wins.

00:25:09.970 --> 00:25:13.970
So, the progress principle is about small
events.

00:25:13.970 --> 00:25:15.729
It's about big events.

00:25:15.729 --> 00:25:19.649
It's about best days at work, worst days,
and all kinds of days in-between.

00:25:19.649 --> 00:25:24.679
In fact, we analyzed all 12 thousand days
that we had data on.

00:25:24.679 --> 00:25:29.240
We found significant differences in inner
work life as a function of whether the day

00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:34.669
had a progress event, a setback event, or
neither.

00:25:34.669 --> 00:25:40.970
And progress is much more likely in some teams
and companies than in others.

00:25:40.970 --> 00:25:46.379
I'm going to show you a couple of ratios of
progress to setback events in a couple of

00:25:46.379 --> 00:25:48.100
the 26 teams that we studied.

00:25:48.100 --> 00:25:52.239
These are really the extremes.

00:25:52.239 --> 00:25:55.639
One of these teams was from Karpenter Corporation.

00:25:55.639 --> 00:25:59.239
The other one from O'Reilly Coated Materials.

00:25:59.239 --> 00:26:03.019
This is the ratio of progress to setbacks
in the diaries from these teams.

00:26:03.019 --> 00:26:09.639
Let's see if you can just guess which is Karpenter
team, which is the O'Reilly team.

00:26:09.639 --> 00:26:16.830
Yeah, it's not too hard, is it? [chuckles]
The vision team is from O'Reilly Corporation.

00:26:16.830 --> 00:26:19.889
They were doing a technically very difficult
project.

00:26:19.889 --> 00:26:21.379
They had a lot of setbacks.

00:26:21.379 --> 00:26:26.809
But for every setback they reported, they
had five progress events.

00:26:26.809 --> 00:26:31.119
The domain team at Karpenter Corporation,
you've gotta pity them.

00:26:31.119 --> 00:26:36.129
For every step forward, they make two steps
backward in their work.

00:26:36.129 --> 00:26:41.450
Imagine how different it would feel to be
working in these two teams.

00:26:41.450 --> 00:26:48.330
So, let's take a step back ourselves right
now and think about the big picture.

00:26:48.330 --> 00:26:52.429
Putting together the inner work life effect
with the progress principle.

00:26:52.429 --> 00:26:56.679
If inner work life drives performance--and
it does.

00:26:56.679 --> 00:27:01.879
That is, inner work life leads people to be
more creative and productive in their work,

00:27:01.879 --> 00:27:05.850
to make progress at these creative projects.

00:27:05.850 --> 00:27:09.899
And progress leads to better inner work life.

00:27:09.899 --> 00:27:12.179
We have a positive feedback loop going on.

00:27:12.179 --> 00:27:19.289
And we call it the "progress loop" because
progress is really the greatest leverage point

00:27:19.289 --> 00:27:21.690
to get this positive cycle going.

00:27:21.690 --> 00:27:25.909
When people are making progress in the work,
that leads to better inner work life, which

00:27:25.909 --> 00:27:31.059
in turn will make it more likely that they'll
be creative and productive in their work,

00:27:31.059 --> 00:27:36.799
which can keep that positive cycle going unless
something intervenes, something interrupts

00:27:36.799 --> 00:27:43.320
the progress, something happens to block the
progress, or something interrupts positive

00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:48.309
inner work life and leads it to become negative.

00:27:48.309 --> 00:27:52.679
This spiral happens in the negative direction,
too, unfortunately.

00:27:52.679 --> 00:27:57.659
So, when people have negative inner work life,
that makes it more difficult for them to make

00:27:57.659 --> 00:28:03.529
progress, be creative and productive, which
in turn will lead to deterioration further

00:28:03.529 --> 00:28:09.129
in inner work life leading to the kind of
death spiral like we saw going on in the Karpenter

00:28:09.129 --> 00:28:10.129
Corporation.

00:28:10.129 --> 00:28:15.940
Unless something happens to intervene and
to make progress more likely or to life inner

00:28:15.940 --> 00:28:18.779
work life or both.

00:28:18.779 --> 00:28:24.419
There was one very bad day for a product designer
at Karpenter Corporation where he seemed to

00:28:24.419 --> 00:28:29.119
realize that this spiral was not gonna go
away, that things were not going to be getting

00:28:29.119 --> 00:28:30.909
better.

00:28:30.909 --> 00:28:33.080
And he was pretty depressed on this day.

00:28:33.080 --> 00:28:40.100
And he said, "It's clear to me now that we
are no longer the leader in product innovation.

00:28:40.100 --> 00:28:45.139
We are the follower."

00:28:45.139 --> 00:28:48.029
So progress is really important.

00:28:48.029 --> 00:28:49.029
What can people do?

00:28:49.029 --> 00:28:50.029
What can managers do?

00:28:50.029 --> 00:28:51.429
What can team leaders do?

00:28:51.429 --> 00:28:55.059
What can co-workers do for each other to make
progress more likely?

00:28:55.059 --> 00:29:01.899
We identified a couple of different classes
of actions that can keep this progress loop

00:29:01.899 --> 00:29:02.899
going.

00:29:02.899 --> 00:29:05.129
One we call "catalyst."

00:29:05.129 --> 00:29:10.460
These are things that can catalyze progress
in the work directly.

00:29:10.460 --> 00:29:13.999
The other is what we call "nourishers."

00:29:13.999 --> 00:29:17.749
And these are things that nourish people's
human soul at work.

00:29:17.749 --> 00:29:20.049
These are things that directly lift inner
work life.

00:29:20.049 --> 00:29:22.509
I'm gonna give you examples of both of these.

00:29:22.509 --> 00:29:28.340
First of all, we identified seven primary
catalysts that can jumpstart progress in the

00:29:28.340 --> 00:29:30.270
work.

00:29:30.270 --> 00:29:33.509
The first of these is having clear and meaningful
goals in the work.

00:29:33.509 --> 00:29:38.759
And the second is, even though you have these
clear goals of what you're trying to achieve,

00:29:38.759 --> 00:29:42.830
you have some autonomy in deciding how to
achieve those goals.

00:29:42.830 --> 00:29:48.960
So, this is the mountain we're going to climb,
but you have the autonomy to use your own

00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:54.029
skills, talents, your own expertise in deciding
how to climb that mountain.

00:29:54.029 --> 00:29:56.789
The negative of the catalysts we call "inhibitors."

00:29:56.789 --> 00:29:59.580
And you can imagine the negative form of these.

00:29:59.580 --> 00:30:04.309
Think about Sophie's diary at Karpenter where
she was talking about how conflicting and

00:30:04.309 --> 00:30:06.190
unclear the goals were.

00:30:06.190 --> 00:30:09.580
Starting the project, now stopping it, now
restarting it again.

00:30:09.580 --> 00:30:12.869
She never really knew what she was supposed
to be doing and neither did her team.

00:30:12.869 --> 00:30:17.970
At the same time, they had very little autonomy,
very little sense of control over what they

00:30:17.970 --> 00:30:20.259
were doing or how they were doing it.

00:30:20.259 --> 00:30:26.950
Contrast that with Dave at O'Reilly Coated
Materials, who had a clear sense of where

00:30:26.950 --> 00:30:33.349
his project was going in that project review,
yet a sense of autonomy of how to do it.

00:30:33.349 --> 00:30:38.820
He got sufficient resources from upper management
to continue to the next stage of the project

00:30:38.820 --> 00:30:40.330
and got help.

00:30:40.330 --> 00:30:45.599
He said much assistance was given in that
project review--actually got helpful feedback

00:30:45.599 --> 00:30:47.140
for going forward in the project.

00:30:47.140 --> 00:30:52.820
Now when we say sufficient resources, we don't
mean essentially lavish resources, but just

00:30:52.820 --> 00:30:56.600
resources that are sufficient to get the work
done.

00:30:56.600 --> 00:30:58.279
Other catalysts.

00:30:58.279 --> 00:31:00.259
Learning from problems.

00:31:00.259 --> 00:31:05.469
One of the most important ways of catalyzing
progress is to have an atmosphere of psychological

00:31:05.469 --> 00:31:11.609
safety where people feel they don't have to
hide errors or mistakes or experiments they

00:31:11.609 --> 00:31:13.779
try that don't work out.

00:31:13.779 --> 00:31:17.989
But where they know that people are welcome
hearing about these things so that they can

00:31:17.989 --> 00:31:24.090
talk about what went wrong, what can we learn
from this, and how can we go forward, rather

00:31:24.090 --> 00:31:30.499
than having blame affixed or having people
punished if things don't work out quite right.

00:31:30.499 --> 00:31:36.249
This has a huge impact on people's ability
to be creative and productive in their work.

00:31:36.249 --> 00:31:41.399
And notice that it's important to learn from
successes as well, not just celebrate it when

00:31:41.399 --> 00:31:43.519
something goes well, which is important.

00:31:43.519 --> 00:31:44.809
You can do that.

00:31:44.809 --> 00:31:47.090
But also to say, "All right, let's debrief.

00:31:47.090 --> 00:31:48.440
Why did this work?

00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:51.450
And what can we learn from it going forward?"

00:31:51.450 --> 00:31:56.529
Having an open idea flow within teams, across
the organization, and even with people outside

00:31:56.529 --> 00:31:57.570
the organization.

00:31:57.570 --> 00:32:02.779
Now, this doesn't mean that every idea is
going to be accepted, but every idea will

00:32:02.779 --> 00:32:07.349
be respected and at least listened to.

00:32:07.349 --> 00:32:12.489
And finally, having sufficient time to do
the work, but not too much.

00:32:12.489 --> 00:32:20.489
We found that the optimal level of time pressure
for creativity is low to moderate time pressure.

00:32:20.489 --> 00:32:26.169
We also found some other, more complicated
effects of time pressure on creativity and

00:32:26.169 --> 00:32:28.419
productivity, but we'll save that for the
Q&amp;A.

00:32:28.419 --> 00:32:31.119
If you're interested, please ask me about
it.

00:32:31.119 --> 00:32:32.989
And now onto the nourishers.

00:32:32.989 --> 00:32:37.070
These are things that directly support inner
work life, directly support the people trying

00:32:37.070 --> 00:32:38.960
to do the work.

00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:41.480
First of all, basic respect and recognition.

00:32:41.480 --> 00:32:52.289
A sense that people know you exist and that
your efforts are valued inside the organization.

00:32:52.289 --> 00:32:53.969
Encouragement when the work is difficult.

00:32:53.969 --> 00:32:54.969
A sense of confidence.

00:32:54.969 --> 00:32:57.169
"We know you can do it."

00:32:57.169 --> 00:33:01.299
You can imagine the opposite of each of these,
which by the way, we call the opposite of

00:33:01.299 --> 00:33:05.100
nourishers, the "toxins" that can poison a
work environment.

00:33:05.100 --> 00:33:07.129
Emotional support.

00:33:07.129 --> 00:33:11.729
If someone's having difficulty in their professional
life or their personal life, simply having

00:33:11.729 --> 00:33:17.559
that acknowledged, having it validated at
work, can make a huge difference in the quality

00:33:17.559 --> 00:33:20.609
of their inner work life.

00:33:20.609 --> 00:33:22.099
And affiliation and camaraderies.

00:33:22.099 --> 00:33:24.929
A sense of bonding with the people you work
with.

00:33:24.929 --> 00:33:31.099
A sense of being able to trust each other
and count on each other.

00:33:31.099 --> 00:33:34.190
Sometimes it's a matter of having fun with
each other.

00:33:34.190 --> 00:33:39.389
And that's opposed to the opposite--the toxins--which
are really negative interpersonal conflict

00:33:39.389 --> 00:33:40.399
that can flare up.

00:33:40.399 --> 00:33:44.139
And if it goes unchecked, that can poison
inner work life.

00:33:44.139 --> 00:33:51.779
So, given these catalysts and these nourishers,
we now have some sense of how to answer that

00:33:51.779 --> 00:33:52.870
opening question.

00:33:52.870 --> 00:33:58.299
Remember, the question was what makes people
happy, motivated, productive, and creative

00:33:58.299 --> 00:33:59.500
at work?

00:33:59.500 --> 00:34:02.879
So, what makes people happy and motivated?

00:34:02.879 --> 00:34:05.890
What gives them positive inner work life?

00:34:05.890 --> 00:34:08.810
Making progress on meaningful work.

00:34:08.810 --> 00:34:15.599
And getting nourishers that we just talked
about to sustain their inner work life.

00:34:15.599 --> 00:34:20.610
And interestingly, catalysts can also directly
lift inner work life.

00:34:20.610 --> 00:34:25.060
You notice that curved arrow at the bottom
of the figure?

00:34:25.060 --> 00:34:28.710
When people find out, for example, that they're
getting a new resource, which is one of the

00:34:28.710 --> 00:34:29.710
catalysts.

00:34:29.710 --> 00:34:33.580
Well, if they find out they're getting a resource
that they really need to make progress in

00:34:33.580 --> 00:34:37.000
their work, they feel great.

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:40.559
You feel great, don't you, when you find out
you're getting a resource you really need?

00:34:40.559 --> 00:34:41.869
Even before you get it.

00:34:41.869 --> 00:34:47.510
Even before it can possibly add to your progress,
you know that you'll be able to make that

00:34:47.510 --> 00:34:49.480
progress in the work.

00:34:49.480 --> 00:34:54.940
And also, it shows that you are valued by
your organization.

00:34:54.940 --> 00:34:58.260
You and your work matter enough to get this
resource.

00:34:58.260 --> 00:35:03.809
So, it can have an interesting direct effect
on inner work life to get a catalyst.

00:35:03.809 --> 00:35:07.170
And what makes people productive and creative
at work?

00:35:07.170 --> 00:35:09.710
What helps them make progress in their work?

00:35:09.710 --> 00:35:12.750
First of all, having positive inner work life.

00:35:12.750 --> 00:35:19.240
And also, getting a regular supply of the
catalysts day by day.

00:35:19.240 --> 00:35:24.099
So progress is key, but is it obvious?

00:35:24.099 --> 00:35:29.579
It does seem a little bit obvious sometimes
that well, of course people feel great when

00:35:29.579 --> 00:35:34.140
they make progress in their work.

00:35:34.140 --> 00:35:39.559
So we wondered, is this really top of mind
for managers?

00:35:39.559 --> 00:35:46.230
Do managers know what an incredible motivational
force it is to just get support for making

00:35:46.230 --> 00:35:48.700
progress in your work?

00:35:48.700 --> 00:35:54.730
So, we recently surveyed nearly 700 managers
from a variety of companies at a variety of

00:35:54.730 --> 00:35:56.850
levels around the world.

00:35:56.850 --> 00:35:58.480
And we gave them a very simple question.

00:35:58.480 --> 00:36:02.520
We said, "Here are five employee motivators.

00:36:02.520 --> 00:36:05.609
Rank them in terms of how important you think
they are."

00:36:05.609 --> 00:36:07.710
And these are the motivators.

00:36:07.710 --> 00:36:15.380
Recognition, incentives, clear goals, progress
in the work, and interpersonal support.

00:36:15.380 --> 00:36:17.700
Now, all these are motivators, right?

00:36:17.700 --> 00:36:23.180
But we know from our research that making
progress in the work is number one.

00:36:23.180 --> 00:36:28.000
So, did these managers rank progress as number
one?

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:30.780
Yeah, not so much.

00:36:30.780 --> 00:36:38.020
Number one, recognition, in the view of these
700 managers that we surveyed.

00:36:38.020 --> 00:36:41.020
Number two, clear goals.

00:36:41.020 --> 00:36:45.079
Number three, incentives.

00:36:45.079 --> 00:36:48.100
Number four, interpersonal support.

00:36:48.100 --> 00:36:49.100
Yes.

00:36:49.100 --> 00:36:53.770
Progress in the work, which we know is number
one as a motivator, came in dead last.

00:36:53.770 --> 00:36:59.150
In fact, only five percent of the managers
taking the survey ranked progress number one.

00:36:59.150 --> 00:37:03.670
If they were making their choices randomly,
20 percent of them would've chosen progress,

00:37:03.670 --> 00:37:04.670
right?

00:37:04.670 --> 00:37:07.730
[audience chuckles] So they were actively
saying they didn't think progress was that

00:37:07.730 --> 00:37:09.270
important for motivation.

00:37:09.270 --> 00:37:13.039
They didn't think it was that important for
them to support progress in the work.

00:37:13.039 --> 00:37:17.090
And that's what the question said, actually--supporting
progress in the work.

00:37:17.090 --> 00:37:18.880
They didn't think it was that important.

00:37:18.880 --> 00:37:24.640
And certainly, in the companies that we studied,
we didn't see a lot of evidence that managers

00:37:24.640 --> 00:37:28.370
acted like they thought it was really important
to support daily progress in the work.

00:37:28.370 --> 00:37:34.490
In fact, of all seven companies, only one
had managers at all levels and co-workers

00:37:34.490 --> 00:37:40.730
across the organization who consistently supported
the progress of the people working in the

00:37:40.730 --> 00:37:43.430
creative trenches.

00:37:43.430 --> 00:37:46.670
It was O'Reilly Coated Materials, of course.

00:37:46.670 --> 00:37:51.589
And by the way, O'Reilly was the only company
to have a true technological breakthrough

00:37:51.589 --> 00:37:53.970
in all the months that we were studying them.

00:37:53.970 --> 00:37:56.460
And I don't think that's a coincidence.

00:37:56.460 --> 00:37:58.650
So what is the implication here?

00:37:58.650 --> 00:38:03.589
If you're a team leader, if you're a manager,
what's the implication?

00:38:03.589 --> 00:38:10.000
The implication is not that you have to somehow
try to psychologize the people who work with

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:11.451
you and the people who work for you.

00:38:11.451 --> 00:38:15.450
You don't have to become an emotional intelligence
genius.

00:38:15.450 --> 00:38:17.599
You don't have to pry into people's inner
work lives.

00:38:17.599 --> 00:38:20.510
In fact, that would really be a bad idea.

00:38:20.510 --> 00:38:24.599
And it doesn't mean that you have to bring
in comedians at lunchtime to cheer people

00:38:24.599 --> 00:38:25.859
up.

00:38:25.859 --> 00:38:30.680
What it does mean is that you have to support
progress every day.

00:38:30.680 --> 00:38:35.349
And the first step is to simply keep yourself
aware of it.

00:38:35.349 --> 00:38:37.910
Put in on your mental agenda.

00:38:37.910 --> 00:38:40.660
Pay attention to it.

00:38:40.660 --> 00:38:46.589
And we think it can help to have a daily progress
checklist.

00:38:46.589 --> 00:38:50.500
I don't know if any of you are familiar with
this wonderful book from 2009 called "The

00:38:50.500 --> 00:38:51.660
Checklist Manifesto."

00:38:51.660 --> 00:38:54.760
Yeah, a few people have read that.

00:38:54.760 --> 00:38:59.680
It's by Atul Gawande, who's a Harvard Medical
School surgeon and author on a number of health

00:38:59.680 --> 00:39:00.680
topics.

00:39:00.680 --> 00:39:05.900
Gawande decided with his research team a few
years ago to see if they could do something

00:39:05.900 --> 00:39:13.190
to reduce the incredibly high incidence of
unnecessary complications, and even deaths,

00:39:13.190 --> 00:39:16.309
because of surgical accidents.

00:39:16.309 --> 00:39:23.070
So they created what they call the "safe surgery
checklist" as a discipline for surgical teams

00:39:23.070 --> 00:39:27.410
to follow--something that they actually have
to physically check off the items to make

00:39:27.410 --> 00:39:33.289
sure that they've taken care of these things
before and during surgery.

00:39:33.289 --> 00:39:42.270
This checklist consists of things that are
blazingly obvious to any surgeon.

00:39:42.270 --> 00:39:43.950
Anyone should know to do this, right?

00:39:43.950 --> 00:39:45.299
This is good surgical practice.

00:39:45.299 --> 00:39:49.940
Things like, everybody on the surgical team
should introduce themselves by name before

00:39:49.940 --> 00:39:54.080
they get started, so that if anything bad
starts to happen during the operation, they

00:39:54.080 --> 00:39:56.799
can call each other by name.

00:39:56.799 --> 00:39:59.710
Something else on the surgery checklist.

00:39:59.710 --> 00:40:05.440
Before the surgery starts, we should all say
out loud what side of the body we're going

00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:07.230
to be operating on.

00:40:07.230 --> 00:40:09.450
Make sure we all agree.

00:40:09.450 --> 00:40:12.910
And before we close the incision at the end,
we should make sure that any instruments and

00:40:12.910 --> 00:40:18.680
sponges that went into the body have now come
out of the body.

00:40:18.680 --> 00:40:20.039
Very basic things.

00:40:20.039 --> 00:40:28.849
And yet, following the safe surgery checklist
had an unbelievable impact--a 36 percent reduction

00:40:28.849 --> 00:40:38.280
in serious complications and an incredible
47 percent reduction in deaths.

00:40:38.280 --> 00:40:43.490
Now management isn't brain surgery, but it
is pretty complicated and there are a lot

00:40:43.490 --> 00:40:45.559
of things you have to keep in mind.

00:40:45.559 --> 00:40:49.160
That's why we recommend using a daily progress
checklist.

00:40:49.160 --> 00:40:54.240
Just spend five minutes at the end of the
day to write down, "OK, what progress did

00:40:54.240 --> 00:40:57.039
my team make today?

00:40:57.039 --> 00:40:58.710
What might have been holding them back?

00:40:58.710 --> 00:41:01.710
What inhibitors might they have been encountering?

00:41:01.710 --> 00:41:04.190
Were there any toxins?"

00:41:04.190 --> 00:41:09.859
And then, this is the most important piece,
think of one thing that you can do--just one

00:41:09.859 --> 00:41:16.200
thing--the following day, even if it's something
small that can enable your people to make

00:41:16.200 --> 00:41:17.809
more progress in their work.

00:41:17.809 --> 00:41:20.890
And you can do this as a co-worker as well.

00:41:20.890 --> 00:41:26.849
In fact, those nourishers and those catalysts
come just as well from co-workers as they

00:41:26.849 --> 00:41:30.049
do from team leaders or from higher-level
managers.

00:41:30.049 --> 00:41:33.160
In fact, sometimes more effectively.

00:41:33.160 --> 00:41:38.090
And keeping a daily checklist or some kind
of a work diary can actually have positive

00:41:38.090 --> 00:41:41.280
benefits for your own inner work life and
your own sense of progress.

00:41:41.280 --> 00:41:46.220
There's some great psychological research
lately showing that simply writing about something

00:41:46.220 --> 00:41:50.270
difficult you're dealing with can help you
feel better about it and can help you plan

00:41:50.270 --> 00:41:53.339
to deal with it more effectively.

00:41:53.339 --> 00:41:57.740
And noting your progress every day, even if
it's been a frustrating day, noting whatever

00:41:57.740 --> 00:42:03.210
progress you did make can rescue your inner
work life at the end of the day and can help

00:42:03.210 --> 00:42:07.440
you plan to make better progress the following
day.

00:42:07.440 --> 00:42:16.220
So, your big takeaway here is to support progress
every day and support the people trying to

00:42:16.220 --> 00:42:17.400
make that progress.

00:42:17.400 --> 00:42:23.539
If you can do that inside your organization,
inside your group, inside your own little

00:42:23.539 --> 00:42:28.550
team, you will support the inner work lives
of the people around you.

00:42:28.550 --> 00:42:32.250
They will feel happier and more motivated
in their work.

00:42:32.250 --> 00:42:34.410
They will make more progress in their work.

00:42:34.410 --> 00:42:37.309
And that will lead to long-term benefits.

00:42:37.309 --> 00:42:42.720
So not only will their personal well-being
be enhanced, but these people will be more

00:42:42.720 --> 00:42:45.279
committed and more collegial--

00:42:45.279 --> 00:42:52.510
[digital voice]

00:42:52.510 --> 00:42:56.130
OK.

00:42:56.130 --> 00:42:59.880
I'm not sure what number I'm supposed to press,
but I will finish up.

00:42:59.880 --> 00:43:10.780
Let me end with a quote from a programmer
named Tom on an information management team.

00:43:10.780 --> 00:43:14.750
This comes from a project that his team was
doing where they were working nearly around

00:43:14.750 --> 00:43:21.010
the clock for eight days to solve a very complicated
problem where 145 million dollars were at

00:43:21.010 --> 00:43:23.890
stake for the company.

00:43:23.890 --> 00:43:28.450
We saw more examples of the progress principle,
more catalysts and nourishers, during those

00:43:28.450 --> 00:43:36.150
eight days than we saw in some other teams
during the entire months that we studied them.

00:43:36.150 --> 00:43:40.380
The top management in that company cleared
the decks for the team, taking away all other

00:43:40.380 --> 00:43:41.630
demands.

00:43:41.630 --> 00:43:45.640
They even stopped by to encourage them late
in the evening as they were working by bringing

00:43:45.640 --> 00:43:47.550
food and treats.

00:43:47.550 --> 00:43:52.000
Other groups inside the company really helped
out doing whatever they could.

00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:54.119
The team members rallied around.

00:43:54.119 --> 00:43:59.150
One person even postponed her vacation so
she could come in and work with her team.

00:43:59.150 --> 00:44:03.369
And of all the catalysts and nourishers, I
think the best came from the team leader herself,

00:44:03.369 --> 00:44:09.740
who got in there, rolled up her sleeves, worked
alongside the team every day, helping them

00:44:09.740 --> 00:44:15.570
to solve multiple technical problems that
came up and she provided nourishers.

00:44:15.570 --> 00:44:19.309
The seventh night, when people were starting
to get really discouraged because they had

00:44:19.309 --> 00:44:24.570
one more hurdle to get over, she lifted their
spirits by singing a silly song as midnight

00:44:24.570 --> 00:44:25.950
approached.

00:44:25.950 --> 00:44:29.319
The result was a superb solution.

00:44:29.319 --> 00:44:33.079
Really creative, productive work--

00:44:33.079 --> 00:44:37.690
[digital voice]

00:44:37.690 --> 00:44:40.000
OK.

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:44.710
I'm assuming that somebody's been dialing
in here and they're trying to get through,

00:44:44.710 --> 00:44:47.880
but maybe they can hit their mute button or
something.

00:44:47.880 --> 00:44:56.319
So, this is what Tom had to say in his diary
during that golden week.

00:44:56.319 --> 00:45:03.779
He said, "The truth is everyone is working
crazy hours, doing impossible tasks, and still

00:45:03.779 --> 00:45:07.460
keeping on the cheery side of the street.

00:45:07.460 --> 00:45:08.480
God help me.

00:45:08.480 --> 00:45:11.000
I do love them so."

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:13.190
So, I've seen it happen.

00:45:13.190 --> 00:45:17.070
If you can apply the progress principle every
day, you can make a real difference in your

00:45:17.070 --> 00:45:21.150
organization and in the lives of the people
working in it and in your own life.

00:45:21.150 --> 00:45:22.150
Thank you very much.

00:45:22.150 --> 00:45:22.380
[applause]
