00:00:11.178 --> 00:00:14.414
&gt;&gt; Let's face it none of us
really think about our leftovers

00:00:14.414 --> 00:00:16.917
beyond their function as a
convenient alternative

00:00:16.917 --> 00:00:18.352
when we're
feeling lazy.

00:00:18.352 --> 00:00:20.754
But did you know there's a lot
more to last night's meal

00:00:20.754 --> 00:00:22.222
than meets the eye.

00:00:22.222 --> 00:00:24.224

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:33.600
&gt;&gt; During World War I
it was considered patriotic

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.303
to consume every
last scrap of food.

00:00:36.303 --> 00:00:39.273
And during the Great Depression
re-purposing your meal

00:00:39.273 --> 00:00:40.974
avoided the
sin of waste.

00:00:41.541 --> 00:00:43.543
[music playing] 

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:56.423
&gt;&gt; Grocery prices fell in the
1960s and throwing food away

00:00:56.423 --> 00:00:58.692
was considered
a sign of affluence.

00:00:58.692 --> 00:01:02.663
Inexpensive fast food and
frozen meals also proved

00:01:02.663 --> 00:01:05.165
more convenient
than cooking at home.

00:01:06.066 --> 00:01:08.068

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.709
&gt;&gt; As women
entered the workforce,

00:01:15.709 --> 00:01:18.178
they were less willing
and had less time

00:01:18.178 --> 00:01:19.846
to get creative
in the kitchen.

00:01:20.747 --> 00:01:22.749
[music playing] 

00:01:31.024 --> 00:01:32.326
&gt;&gt; According to
a recent study

00:01:32.326 --> 00:01:35.062
by the nonprofit
organization ReFED

00:01:35.062 --> 00:01:39.766
Americans toss out 27
million tons of food each year.

00:01:40.233 --> 00:01:41.134
Why?

00:01:41.134 --> 00:01:43.437
Because they forget
about their leftovers,

00:01:43.437 --> 00:01:46.206
grow bored of them
or simply dislike them.

00:01:47.374 --> 00:01:49.376
[music playing] 

00:01:55.048 --> 00:01:58.819
&gt;&gt; Access to nutritious meals
is a real concern in America

00:01:58.819 --> 00:02:00.821
and advocates believe
that leftovers

00:02:00.821 --> 00:02:03.924
can play an important role
in cutting back waste.

00:02:03.924 --> 00:02:07.661
One solution is to make eating
your leftovers a priority again

00:02:07.661 --> 00:02:09.496
through public
service campaigns

00:02:09.496 --> 00:02:11.331
like the ones during
World War I.

00:02:11.331 --> 00:02:14.401
So, eating leftovers
doesn't mean you're lazy.

00:02:14.401 --> 00:02:16.336
It might just
make you a Patriot.

00:02:22.376 --> 00:02:23.543
&gt;&gt; March On.

00:02:23.543 --> 00:02:26.013
Celebrating Women
Who Changed the World.
