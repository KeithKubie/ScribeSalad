00:00:00.462 --> 00:00:02.420
Just want to follow up
on the last video, where

00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:05.030
we threw balls in the air, and
saw how long they stayed up

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:05.530
in the air.

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:08.109
And we used that to figure
out how fast we initially

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:10.499
threw the ball and how
high they went in the air.

00:00:10.499 --> 00:00:12.790
And in the last video, we
did it with specific numbers.

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:13.800
In this video, I
just want to see

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.129
if we can derive some
interesting formulas so that we

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:19.040
can do the computations
really fast in our brains,

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:21.840
while we're playing this game
out on some type of a field,

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.880
and we don't necessarily
have any paper around.

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.880
So let's say that the ball
is in the air for delta t.

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.120
Delta t is equal
to time in the air.

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.340
Then we know that
the time up is going

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:38.800
to be half that, which is the
same thing as the time down.

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.880
The time up is going to
be equal to delta t-- I'm

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:44.570
going to do that
in the same color--

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:49.380
is going to be equal to the
time in the air divided by 2.

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:52.060
So what was our
initial velocity?

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:54.370
Well, all we have to
do is remind ourselves

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:57.780
that the change
in velocity, which

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.020
is the same thing as
the final velocity

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:02.026
minus the initial velocity.

00:01:02.026 --> 00:01:03.400
So the final
velocity-- remember,

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.691
we're just talking about half
of the path of this ball.

00:01:05.691 --> 00:01:08.175
So the time that
it gets released,

00:01:08.175 --> 00:01:10.610
and it's going at kind of
its maximum upward velocity,

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.470
and it goes slower, and slower,
slower, all the way until it's

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.220
stationary for just
a moment, and then

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:17.080
it starts going down again.

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.810
Now remember, the acceleration
is constant downwards

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:21.524
this entire time.

00:01:21.524 --> 00:01:23.190
So what is the final
velocity if we just

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:24.680
consider half of the time?

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:25.870
Well, it's the time.

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:26.830
It's 0.

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:32.580
So it's going to be 0
minus our initial velocity,

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:34.040
when it was taking off.

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.130
That's our change in velocity.

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:40.500
This is our change
in velocity, is

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:46.560
going to be equal to the
acceleration of gravity,

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.930
negative 9.8 meters
per second squared--

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:51.820
or the acceleration
due to gravity

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:54.800
when an object is in free fall,
to be technically correct--

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:59.100
times the time that
we are going up.

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.194
So times delta t up,
which is the same thing.

00:02:03.194 --> 00:02:04.110
I won't even write it.

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.510
Delta t up is the same
thing as our total time

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:12.590
in the air divided by 2.

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:17.670
And so we get negative
the initial velocity is

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.740
equal to-- this thing,
when you divide it by 2,

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:25.100
is going to be 4.9 meters
per second squared--

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:30.047
we still have our negative
out front-- times our delta t.

00:02:30.047 --> 00:02:31.880
Remember, this is our
total time in the air,

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:32.770
not just the time up.

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:34.590
This is our total
time in the air.

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.580
And then we multiply both
sides times a negative.

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:40.290
We get our initial
velocity is just

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:47.330
going to be equal to 4.9
meters per second squared times

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:52.710
the total time that
we are in the air.

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:55.030
Or you could say
it's going to be

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:58.254
9.8 meters per second squared
times half of the time

00:02:58.254 --> 00:02:59.170
that we're in the air.

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.880
Either of those would get
you the same calculation.

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.620
So let's figure out our total
distance, or the distance

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.150
that we travel in the time up.

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.530
So that'll give us
our peak distance.

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:12.850
Remember that distance-- or
I should say displacement,

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:14.650
in this situation--
displacement is

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:21.380
equal to average velocity
times change in time.

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:24.670
The change in time that we
care about is the time up.

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:26.980
So that is our delta t over 2.

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:30.620
Our total time divided by 2.

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:33.720
This is our time up.

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.316
And what's our average velocity?

00:03:39.316 --> 00:03:40.690
Well, the average
velocity, if we

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:44.470
assume constant acceleration,
is your initial velocity

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:47.570
plus your final velocity over 2.

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:50.490
It's really just the
mean of the two things.

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:52.900
Well, we know what our
initial velocity is.

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:55.000
Our initial velocity is
this thing over here.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.250
So this is this thing over here.

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:58.840
Our final velocity--
remember, we're

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:00.390
just talking about
the first half

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:02.140
of the time the
ball is in the air--

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:04.730
so it's final velocity is 0.

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:08.290
We're talking when it gets
to this peak point, right

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:11.980
over here-- that's from two
videos ago-- that peak point

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:13.040
right over there.

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.470
So our average
velocity is just going

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:20.290
to be this stuff divided by 2.

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:25.870
So it's going to be 4.9 meters
per second squared times delta

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:32.380
t over 2.

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:35.890
So this right here, this
is our average velocity.

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:38.120
Velocity average.

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:39.810
So let's stick that
back over here.

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:43.510
So our maximum
displacement is going

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:45.890
to be our average
velocity-- so that

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:51.160
is 4.9 meters per second
squared-- times delta

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:55.980
t, all of that over 2.

00:04:55.980 --> 00:05:00.060
And then we multiply it
again times the time up.

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:03.270
So times delta t over 2 again.

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:04.980
This is the same thing.

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:06.444
These are the same thing.

00:05:06.444 --> 00:05:07.610
And then we can simplify it.

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:12.790
Our maximum displacement is
equal to 4.9 meters per second

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:22.340
squared times delta t
squared, all of that over 4.

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:27.150
And then we can just
divide 4.9 divided by 4.

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:37.275
4.9 divided by 4 is-- let me
just get the calculator out.

00:05:37.275 --> 00:05:39.275
I don't want to do that
in my head, get this far

00:05:39.275 --> 00:05:40.441
and make a careless mistake.

00:05:40.441 --> 00:05:46.990
4.9 divided by 4 is 1.225.

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:48.920
So our maximum
displacement is going

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:57.740
to be 1.225 times our total
time in the air squared,

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:03.760
which is a pretty
straightforward calculation.

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:07.700
So this is our max
displacement, kind

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:11.210
of how high we get displaced.

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:13.420
Right when that
ball is stationary,

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:17.360
or has no net velocity, just
for a moment, and starts

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:19.290
decelerating downwards.

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:20.160
So we can use that.

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:24.150
If a ball is in the air for
5 seconds-- we can verify

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:26.480
our computation from
the last video--

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:33.250
our maximum displacement, 1.225,
times 5 squared, which is 25,

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:35.230
will give us 30.625.

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:36.910
That's what we got
in the last video.

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:39.140
If the ball's in the
air for, I don't know,

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:45.300
2.3 seconds-- so
it's 1.225 times 2.3

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:50.870
squared-- then that means it
went 6.48 meters in the air.

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:55.250
So anyway, I just wanted to give
you a simple expression that

00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:57.990
gives you the maximum
displacement from the ground,

00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:00.480
assuming air resistance
is negligible,

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:04.259
as a function of the
total time in the air.

00:07:04.259 --> 00:07:04.800
I don't know.

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:06.290
I find that pretty fun.

00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:08.940
And it's a neat game to play.
