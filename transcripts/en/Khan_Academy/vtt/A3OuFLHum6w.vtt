00:00:00.369 --> 00:00:01.446
- [Voiceover] So what we're
going to do in this video

00:00:01.446 --> 00:00:04.109
is look at a series of
vectors, and we're gonna

00:00:04.109 --> 00:00:06.389
draw them in standard form,
where their initial points

00:00:06.389 --> 00:00:08.932
or their tails are
gonna sit at the origin.

00:00:08.932 --> 00:00:10.106
And we're gonna see if we can figure out

00:00:10.106 --> 00:00:12.647
the angles that they
form, the positive angles

00:00:12.647 --> 00:00:15.321
that they form with the positive x-axis.

00:00:15.321 --> 00:00:16.724
And like always, pause this video and see

00:00:16.724 --> 00:00:18.159
if you could figure out
what these thetas are

00:00:18.159 --> 00:00:19.461
going to be on your own, and we're gonna

00:00:19.461 --> 00:00:21.398
figure 'em out in degrees.

00:00:21.398 --> 00:00:24.200
So in this first one, I have the vector u.

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.343
If we were to write it
in unit-vector notation,

00:00:26.343 --> 00:00:28.363
sometimes this is called
engineering notation,

00:00:28.363 --> 00:00:30.365
we would say it's three
times the unit vector

00:00:30.365 --> 00:00:33.719
in the horizontal direction,
the i unit vector,

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.606
plus four times the unit vector
in the vertical direction

00:00:36.606 --> 00:00:39.288
or you could view this as
the x-component is three

00:00:39.288 --> 00:00:41.426
and the y-component is
four, and you see that here.

00:00:41.426 --> 00:00:44.908
If you start at the origin,
we're gonna move three

00:00:44.908 --> 00:00:46.766
in the horizontal direction,
and we're gonna move

00:00:46.766 --> 00:00:49.365
four in the vertical direction.

00:00:49.365 --> 00:00:51.705
Now to figure out this theta, there's

00:00:51.705 --> 00:00:52.826
a couple of ways to think about it.

00:00:52.826 --> 00:00:54.808
We could just construct a right triangle

00:00:54.808 --> 00:00:56.182
for this one in particular.

00:00:56.182 --> 00:00:59.006
We could say, okay, the
x-coordinate is three.

00:00:59.006 --> 00:01:02.587
So if we were to create
a right triangle here,

00:01:02.587 --> 00:01:05.028
this side would have a length of three,

00:01:05.028 --> 00:01:08.911
and then we have a height of four

00:01:08.911 --> 00:01:10.606
or the y-coordinate is four.

00:01:10.606 --> 00:01:14.608
So this side has a length of four,

00:01:14.608 --> 00:01:17.124
and we know just from
even our basic SOHCAHTOA

00:01:17.124 --> 00:01:19.907
definitions of trig functions
that what trig function

00:01:19.907 --> 00:01:22.367
involves the opposite of an angle?

00:01:22.367 --> 00:01:25.164
So the opposite of an angle,
and the adjacent of an angle?

00:01:25.164 --> 00:01:26.269
Well, tangent does.

00:01:26.269 --> 00:01:27.450
SOHCAHTOA.

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.070
So we know, we know that
the tangent of theta

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.030
is going to be equal to the
length of the opposite side,

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:37.887
which is four, over the length of

00:01:37.887 --> 00:01:40.967
the adjacent side, over three.

00:01:40.967 --> 00:01:42.949
And so if we wanted to solve for theta,

00:01:42.949 --> 00:01:45.889
we could just say that theta is equal to

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:47.748
the inverse tangent.

00:01:47.748 --> 00:01:49.409
Sometimes people say arc tangent

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:53.424
of 4/3, of four over ...

00:01:55.024 --> 00:01:58.292
four over three, and let's evaluate this.

00:01:58.292 --> 00:02:01.654
And I'm gonna get my
calculator out to do it.

00:02:01.654 --> 00:02:06.654
So I wanna take four divided by three,

00:02:06.932 --> 00:02:09.394
which is that, and I
had already had pressed

00:02:09.394 --> 00:02:11.152
this button right over here that takes my

00:02:11.152 --> 00:02:14.054
tangent and makes it
into an inverse tangent.

00:02:14.054 --> 00:02:16.994
So I'm gonna take the
inverse tangent of this,

00:02:16.994 --> 00:02:21.994
and I get, I get roughly 53.1 degrees.

00:02:22.256 --> 00:02:25.568
So this is approximately

00:02:25.568 --> 00:02:29.613
53.1 degrees, which looks about right.

00:02:29.613 --> 00:02:30.992
This looks like a little
bit more, even though

00:02:30.992 --> 00:02:33.288
I didn't draw it
completely super precisely.

00:02:33.288 --> 00:02:34.211
I hand-drew this.

00:02:34.211 --> 00:02:36.608
It looks a little bit more
than a 45 degree angle,

00:02:36.608 --> 00:02:39.650
so that feels, that feels pretty good.

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:41.149
Now another thing you might have said,

00:02:41.149 --> 00:02:42.005
"Hey. Well, look.

00:02:42.005 --> 00:02:44.043
"Four is the y-component.

00:02:44.043 --> 00:02:47.163
"Three is the x-component,
and so maybe tangent

00:02:47.163 --> 00:02:49.048
"of theta is always going to be

00:02:49.048 --> 00:02:52.342
"the y-component over the x-component."

00:02:52.342 --> 00:02:54.205
And that, in fact, is the case.

00:02:54.205 --> 00:02:55.403
And that actually comes
straight out of the

00:02:55.403 --> 00:02:57.987
unit circle definition
of the trig functions,

00:02:57.987 --> 00:02:59.764
where you could say that if you have

00:02:59.764 --> 00:03:03.133
a unit circle, if you have, I
could draw it right over here.

00:03:03.133 --> 00:03:06.112
So let me draw the coordinates.

00:03:06.112 --> 00:03:08.749
So if I were to draw a unit
circle right over here,

00:03:08.749 --> 00:03:10.629
and if I were to have some line,

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:12.045
here we're thinking about vectors,

00:03:12.045 --> 00:03:14.791
that the angle formed
with the positive x-axis,

00:03:14.791 --> 00:03:18.488
the tangent of that
angle, tangent of theta

00:03:18.488 --> 00:03:20.250
is going to be the y-coordinate, where we

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.710
intersect the circle,
over the x-coordinate.

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:23.970
And so you could imagine if you made

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.444
a unit circle right here,
if you made a unit circle

00:03:26.444 --> 00:03:30.168
right over here, the ratio
between the y-coordinate

00:03:30.168 --> 00:03:31.930
and the x-coordinate of
this point right over here

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:33.627
where we intersect the
circle is going to be

00:03:33.627 --> 00:03:35.865
the same thing as the ratio
between four and three.

00:03:35.865 --> 00:03:37.725
So this is going to be,
this also is going to be

00:03:37.725 --> 00:03:40.826
one and 1/3 or 4/3.

00:03:40.826 --> 00:03:42.965
So either way, you could
think of, when you think of

00:03:42.965 --> 00:03:45.569
vectors, the tangent of
the angle that it forms

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:49.030
with the positive x-axis is going to be,

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:53.350
is going to be the y-component
over the x-component.

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:55.990
So it's nice when everything
kinda fits together like that.

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:57.245
So let's leverage that to figure out

00:03:57.245 --> 00:03:59.868
this, to figure out this
angle right over there.

00:03:59.868 --> 00:04:04.868
Well, we could say that tangent of theta

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:09.509
is going to be equal to the y-component.

00:04:09.509 --> 00:04:12.250
The y-component over the x-component.

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:15.308
Over, do this in a new color

00:04:15.308 --> 00:04:18.008
or let's see, over negative five.

00:04:18.008 --> 00:04:20.879
So it's gonna be negative 6/5.

00:04:20.879 --> 00:04:23.775
Or we could say theta.

00:04:23.775 --> 00:04:25.294
So let's be a little bit careful.

00:04:25.294 --> 00:04:27.651
So we could say, we could say that theta

00:04:27.651 --> 00:04:32.651
is equal to, is equal
to the inverse tangent.

00:04:32.753 --> 00:04:35.330
Let me do that same color.

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:40.012
Inverse tangent of, I'll
just write it like this,

00:04:40.012 --> 00:04:43.530
negative 6/5, but I'm going
to put a little question mark

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:46.452
here to see if we feel
good about the answer

00:04:46.452 --> 00:04:47.812
that you get when we do this.

00:04:47.812 --> 00:04:48.848
So let's do that.

00:04:48.848 --> 00:04:53.848
So if we do, if we do six divided by five,

00:04:54.053 --> 00:04:55.294
which'll equal to that, and then we

00:04:55.294 --> 00:04:56.134
want to make this negative.

00:04:56.134 --> 00:04:57.869
So that's negative 6/5, and we're gonna

00:04:57.869 --> 00:04:58.953
take the inverse tangents.

00:04:58.953 --> 00:04:59.994
I already pressed this button, so this

00:04:59.994 --> 00:05:01.894
is going to be an inverse
tangent, not tangent.

00:05:01.894 --> 00:05:06.894
I get negative, roughly
negative 50.2 degrees.

00:05:07.831 --> 00:05:12.831
So this is approximately
negative 50.2 degrees.

00:05:12.854 --> 00:05:14.134
Well, does that look right?

00:05:14.134 --> 00:05:14.675
Well, no.

00:05:14.675 --> 00:05:17.173
Theta looks like it's over 90 degrees.

00:05:17.173 --> 00:05:21.134
Negative 50.2 degrees,
negative 50.2 degrees

00:05:21.134 --> 00:05:25.617
is actually giving us this
angle right over here.

00:05:25.617 --> 00:05:27.291
So that's giving us, that's specifying

00:05:27.291 --> 00:05:29.314
another vector, if you think about a line,

00:05:29.314 --> 00:05:33.104
another line that would
have the same tangent.

00:05:33.104 --> 00:05:33.788
The same tangent.

00:05:33.788 --> 00:05:35.211
So it's really important to visualize this

00:05:35.211 --> 00:05:36.268
and think about this,
and the reason why it is

00:05:36.268 --> 00:05:39.533
is because the arc tangent or
the inverse tangent functions

00:05:39.533 --> 00:05:43.353
in calculators, they
will give you an angle

00:05:43.353 --> 00:05:45.154
that is between negative 90 degrees and

00:05:45.154 --> 00:05:47.450
positive 90 degrees, so something

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:49.269
that's in the fourth or first quadrant.

00:05:49.269 --> 00:05:51.571
While here, we have something
that's in the second quadrant.

00:05:51.571 --> 00:05:53.608
So we have to make sure that
we're thinking about it right

00:05:53.608 --> 00:05:56.130
so that we could make the
appropriate adjustment.

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:58.993
So that would give the
case if we were looking

00:05:58.993 --> 00:06:02.651
at a line like that or a vector like that.

00:06:02.651 --> 00:06:05.761
So in order to figure out
what, in order to figure out

00:06:05.761 --> 00:06:08.118
the actual angle, what we want to do

00:06:08.118 --> 00:06:10.911
is add 180 degrees to it.

00:06:10.911 --> 00:06:15.034
So to get the vector that
goes in the other direction.

00:06:15.034 --> 00:06:19.151
So you want to add, so theta
is going to be equal to

00:06:19.151 --> 00:06:21.804
or I could say approximately equal to

00:06:21.804 --> 00:06:26.804
negative 50.2 degrees plus 180 degrees.

00:06:27.131 --> 00:06:28.997
So let's do that.

00:06:28.997 --> 00:06:33.997
So let me plus 180 is equal to

00:06:34.975 --> 00:06:39.136
approximately 129.8 degrees.

00:06:39.136 --> 00:06:44.136
So theta is approximately
equal to 129.8 degrees.

00:06:44.934 --> 00:06:45.812
Did I get that right?

00:06:45.812 --> 00:06:46.977
I have a very short memory.

00:06:46.977 --> 00:06:47.897
Okay, yeah; that's right.

00:06:47.897 --> 00:06:51.918
129.8 degrees, and that looks much better.

00:06:51.918 --> 00:06:55.083
That looks clearly is
an angle we're gonna go.

00:06:55.083 --> 00:06:56.052
That take us to 90 degrees,

00:06:56.052 --> 00:06:58.015
and then we're going above 90 degrees.

00:06:58.015 --> 00:07:00.110
Now another way you could
have thought about this

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:04.853
is what you know from SOHCATOA
and just right triangles.

00:07:04.853 --> 00:07:07.935
We could construct a right triangle where,

00:07:07.935 --> 00:07:11.054
we construct a right
triangle using some colors.

00:07:11.054 --> 00:07:14.212
Well, we know, so I could
maybe just draw it like this.

00:07:14.212 --> 00:07:18.295
So this is the height of
it, and what is that height?

00:07:18.295 --> 00:07:21.869
Well, the height is going to be six,

00:07:21.869 --> 00:07:26.869
and then the base, the
base right over here,

00:07:27.011 --> 00:07:30.254
what is that length going to be?

00:07:30.254 --> 00:07:32.149
Well, we know that we're
going from the origin,

00:07:32.149 --> 00:07:33.795
we're going five back, but
if we think about just the

00:07:33.795 --> 00:07:35.713
absolute value, the length of that line,

00:07:35.713 --> 00:07:38.253
that is going to be five, and so we could

00:07:38.253 --> 00:07:41.652
figure out just using
right triangles this angle.

00:07:41.652 --> 00:07:44.269
Maybe we call that x, and so we could say

00:07:44.269 --> 00:07:47.753
that the tangent of x, tangent of x

00:07:47.753 --> 00:07:52.753
is equal to six over five,
opposite over adjacent.

00:07:52.972 --> 00:07:55.943
Six over five.

00:07:56.623 --> 00:07:59.829
Or that x, or you could say

00:07:59.829 --> 00:08:04.046
x is equal to the inverse tangent

00:08:04.046 --> 00:08:07.688
of 6/5, and what is that going to be?

00:08:07.688 --> 00:08:12.688
So, if we take six divided by five, 1.2.

00:08:13.728 --> 00:08:17.004
And then we're going to take
the inverse tangent of that,

00:08:17.004 --> 00:08:21.944
and we get approximately 50.2 degrees.

00:08:21.944 --> 00:08:26.944
So x is approximately 50.2 degrees,

00:08:27.863 --> 00:08:29.064
which looks right.

00:08:29.064 --> 00:08:30.003
But remember, we're not
trying to figure out x,

00:08:30.003 --> 00:08:31.324
we're trying to figure out,

00:08:31.324 --> 00:08:34.648
we are trying to figure out what theta,

00:08:34.648 --> 00:08:37.726
what theta is, and you
can see that x and theta

00:08:37.726 --> 00:08:39.107
are supplementary.

00:08:39.107 --> 00:08:41.229
So theta plus x is going to be 180 or

00:08:41.229 --> 00:08:44.146
theta's gonna be 180 minus that.

00:08:44.146 --> 00:08:45.985
So 180 minus that.

00:08:45.985 --> 00:08:47.263
So let's just put a negative
sign in front of that

00:08:47.263 --> 00:08:49.968
and add 180, and that might look familiar.

00:08:49.968 --> 00:08:54.968
So that gets to us to
129, roughly 129.8 degrees

00:08:55.469 --> 00:08:59.037
is what exactly what we got before.
