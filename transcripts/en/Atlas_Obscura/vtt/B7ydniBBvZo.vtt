00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:01.340
- I'm Sam O'Brien,

00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:03.410
I'm the Foods Editor at Atlas Obscura,

00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:06.670
and I'm here at the World Grits
Festival in South Carolina

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:08.708
to participate in Rolling in the Grits.

00:00:08.708 --> 00:00:11.375
(intense music)

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:26.750
For the Rolling in the Grits competition,

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:29.240
the contestants each have 10 seconds

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.993
to trap as many grits on
their body as possible.

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:35.033
Should I mention the pool and stuff?

00:00:35.033 --> 00:00:37.080
(intense music)

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:39.400
So the way the Rolling in
the Grits competition works

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:43.880
is they fill a giant
kiddie pool with grits,

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:46.490
it's about 550 pounds of dry grits

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:49.020
and over 300 gallons of water,

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.970
and each contestant dives
right into the pool,

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:54.150
has 10 seconds to trap as much grits

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:55.530
on their body as possible,

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.230
and then they're weighed before and after

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:59.230
to determine who trapped the most grits.

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.283
- Our first place winner,

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:07.828
coming in with 27 pounds of grits...

00:01:07.828 --> 00:01:10.495
(intense music)

00:01:14.624 --> 00:01:17.430
(clapping beat)

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:18.390
- The World Grits Festival

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.290
is a celebration of all things grits.

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:21.510
There are grits you can eat,

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:23.030
there are grits arts and crafts,

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:25.480
and there are even grits
you can jump right into.

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:30.680
It all started in 1986,

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:32.780
when the owner of a local Piggly Wiggly

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.010
was ordering a massive amount
of grits from his supplier,

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:38.267
and the supplier said
something along the lines of

00:01:38.267 --> 00:01:40.600
"You order more grits than anybody else."

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.900
So he'd asked around
to his other suppliers

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:45.490
and they said the same thing.

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:46.620
So, according to the lore,

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:50.170
he determined that St. George
consumed more grits per capita

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:51.620
than other town in the world.

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:56.640
They wanted something flashy and fun

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.200
to attract people to the festival

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.580
so they started the Rolling
in the Grits Competition

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:03.193
the very first year the
festival kicked off in '86.

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.730
I first learned about
the contest last year,

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:11.230
and since then I've
been a little obsessed.

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:12.500
I'm really just the kind of person

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.550
who likes to prepare for
something before doing it.

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.690
My first step was contacting
the world record holder,

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:18.730
Tiffany McGirr,

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:21.490
she trapped 66 pounds
of grits on her body,

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:23.430
so I talked to her about her strategies,

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.260
and asked her if she had any tips for me.

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:26.950
She was super helpful.

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.970
So, last week, before the competition,

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:31.470
I went to my sister's house

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.170
to try out a few of those techniques.

00:02:40.395 --> 00:02:43.312
(orchestral music)

00:02:59.892 --> 00:03:02.892
(air pump whirring)

00:03:06.442 --> 00:03:09.192
(grits sloshing)

00:03:21.651 --> 00:03:24.234
(tape peeling)

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:01.840
- At first it felt a little weird,

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:04.430
the consistency is definitely something

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:06.230
you're not used to swimming through,

00:04:07.524 --> 00:04:10.220
but you get used to it really quickly

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:13.120
and now I'm quite comfortable in here.

00:04:15.146 --> 00:04:16.870
It's not so bad.

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:18.470
It's a little unnerving at first,

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:19.990
but you get used to it.

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:22.330
I feel more ready than I did previously,

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:25.850
because I had never dove
into a pool of grits before,

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:28.410
but I am a little nervous

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:31.190
at how quickly the 10 seconds went by.

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:32.330
I think I'm definitely gonna need

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:35.150
to act faster than I thought,

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:37.163
but I definitely feel more prepared now.

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:40.680
- So that's why we give you the rules,

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:42.640
to let you know at the beginning

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:44.060
that no type of jewelry,

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:46.040
and nothing sharp on you,

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:49.010
any kinda things that would cut the pool,

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:50.220
anything like that.

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:51.820
Make sure when you come up,

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:52.960
pants that come down,

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:55.189
you got something under
that ain't going to

00:04:55.189 --> 00:04:56.336
- [Contestant] Show everything.

00:04:56.336 --> 00:04:57.169
(contestant laughs)

00:04:57.169 --> 00:04:58.226
We don't want to see
no moonies or nothing,

00:04:58.226 --> 00:05:00.857
so you know, make sure
everything's covered.

00:05:00.857 --> 00:05:03.414
- [Lady] One year before, I
had did it here or whatever

00:05:03.414 --> 00:05:04.685
and my pants fell down,

00:05:04.685 --> 00:05:06.602
I didn't have nothing.

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:10.360
- So the grits are just about ready,

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:12.730
and now we're eagerly awaiting round one

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:13.563
of Rolling in the Grits,

00:05:13.563 --> 00:05:15.020
which is the children's round.

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:19.060
- Everybody down here
with the front row seats,

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:20.609
it's the best seats in the house.

00:05:20.609 --> 00:05:21.530
(laughter)

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:23.430
You ever been to a Gallagher concert?

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:24.521
- [Audience] Yeah.

00:05:24.521 --> 00:05:27.161
- [Announcer] You're about
to find out what that means.

00:05:27.161 --> 00:05:28.910
(synth pop)

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:30.610
- [Announcer] Let's not prolong this.

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:31.760
Are you ready?

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:33.150
Go!

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:34.185
- [Crowd] One!

00:05:34.185 --> 00:05:35.514
Two!

00:05:35.514 --> 00:05:36.689
Three!

00:05:36.689 --> 00:05:37.789
Four!

00:05:37.789 --> 00:05:38.969
Five!

00:05:38.969 --> 00:05:40.200
Six!

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:41.365
Seven!

00:05:41.365 --> 00:05:42.392
Eight!

00:05:42.392 --> 00:05:43.440
Nine!

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:44.430
10!

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:45.380
- [Announcer] Stop!

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:50.837
- [Announcer] Take your time, easy!

00:05:50.837 --> 00:05:52.968
Oh, your body got some grits in there.

00:05:52.968 --> 00:05:54.106
(laughter)

00:05:54.106 --> 00:05:55.125
You full of grits, girl?

00:05:55.125 --> 00:05:56.760
(laughter)

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:58.643
Or were you just raised in the south?

00:05:58.643 --> 00:06:00.090
- [Contestant] I was raised in the south.

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:01.201
- Trying to psych myself up.

00:06:01.201 --> 00:06:03.872
Get in the right mindset, you know?

00:06:03.872 --> 00:06:06.754
- [Announcer] All right, all
the way from New York City...

00:06:06.754 --> 00:06:08.484
(crowd cheers)

00:06:08.484 --> 00:06:11.495
Samantha O'Brien!

00:06:11.495 --> 00:06:13.620
- [Announcer] From New York City.

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:15.177
Samantha where are you from exactly?

00:06:15.177 --> 00:06:16.010
- Brooklyn.

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:16.843
- [Announcer] Brooklyn?

00:06:16.843 --> 00:06:17.676
- Yeah.

00:06:17.676 --> 00:06:19.563
- [Announcer] Ah, okay, you
parked the car in the yard?

00:06:19.563 --> 00:06:20.503
(laughter)

00:06:20.503 --> 00:06:21.836
- That's Boston!

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:24.680
- [Announcer] And what
do you do in New York?

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:26.830
- I'm an editor, I'm
actually doing this for work.

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:28.280
- [Announcer] You're an editor?

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:30.870
- Yeah
- Oh, for which magazine?

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:32.570
- It's a website called Atlas Obscura.

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:33.870
- [Announcer] Atlas Obscura.

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:35.617
Everybody, make sure you go on that site.

00:06:35.617 --> 00:06:37.349
She'll have something on there about this.

00:06:37.349 --> 00:06:38.710
She'll probably be on there herself.

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:41.377
(intense music)

00:06:42.841 --> 00:06:44.200
- [Announcer] All right. You ready?

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:45.598
- Mm-hmm.

00:06:45.598 --> 00:06:47.055
- [Announcer] Let's go!

00:06:47.055 --> 00:06:48.164
- [Crowd And Announcer] One!

00:06:48.164 --> 00:06:48.997
Two!

00:06:49.903 --> 00:06:51.058
Three!

00:06:51.058 --> 00:06:52.212
Four!

00:06:52.212 --> 00:06:53.045
Five!

00:06:53.045 --> 00:06:54.491
- [Announcer] Looks like
she's fighting somebody.

00:06:54.491 --> 00:06:56.057
(laughing)

00:06:56.057 --> 00:06:58.610
- [Announcer] Nine, boogie down brawl.

00:06:58.610 --> 00:06:59.792
Ten!

00:06:59.792 --> 00:07:01.133
All right, stop.

00:07:02.603 --> 00:07:03.770
You'd think she was gonna fight somebody

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:05.760
in the Bronx there, huh?

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:06.660
She said Brooklyn.

00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:08.500
Boogie down.

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:11.138
Oh my goodness. Oh my!

00:07:11.138 --> 00:07:13.470
(laughing)

00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:14.870
Samantha, is that still you?

00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:19.090
Is anybody getting this?

00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:20.773
Let's be an editor for her.

00:07:20.773 --> 00:07:22.620
(laughing)

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:24.283
All right, Samantha!

00:07:24.283 --> 00:07:25.142
Give her a hand ladies and gentlemen,

00:07:25.142 --> 00:07:26.080
Give her a hand!

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:27.869
You're a star!

00:07:27.869 --> 00:07:30.119
(applause)

00:07:31.642 --> 00:07:34.270
- It was much thicker than I imagined.

00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:35.623
The grits are much heavier.

00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:40.470
I thought that I would
be swimming in them more

00:07:40.470 --> 00:07:44.297
but instead it was more like
raking it into my pants.

00:07:44.297 --> 00:07:45.836
I think I did pretty good.

00:07:45.836 --> 00:07:47.590
Hard to say because they're
not announcing the weights,

00:07:47.590 --> 00:07:48.960
so it's kind of all a mystery,

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:51.577
but I'm proud of the way I did.

00:07:51.577 --> 00:07:54.311
- [Announcer] Come on! Come on! Ohhh.

00:07:54.311 --> 00:07:57.311
(suspenseful music)

00:08:00.854 --> 00:08:04.021
- [Woman With Hose] You
did good! You did good!

00:08:06.110 --> 00:08:07.560
- If you'll come around
to the back of the stage

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:08.940
when I call your name,

00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:11.243
we've got some money for you.

00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:14.740
Our first place winner...

00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:20.610
coming in with 27 pounds of grits...

00:08:20.610 --> 00:08:23.260
27, we're gonna have to
refill the pool now with her.

00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:28.940
Samantha O'Brien from New York City!

00:08:30.073 --> 00:08:33.177
(hip-hop music)

00:08:33.177 --> 00:08:34.680
- [Announcer] All of these
first timers winning,

00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:37.487
isn't it something?

00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:40.798
All right lets give her a big hand.

00:08:40.798 --> 00:08:44.293
Lets give all our contestants
a big hand and our winners!

00:08:46.877 --> 00:08:49.627
(dramatic music)

00:08:54.130 --> 00:08:55.210
- [Announcer] All right, thank you.

00:08:55.210 --> 00:08:57.000
This concludes the Rolling in the Grits.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.173
Now we will be selling the grits.

00:09:01.990 --> 00:09:03.400
- Thanks so much for watching.

00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:05.860
If you're concerned about food
waste, don't worry about it.

00:09:05.860 --> 00:09:08.270
A local farmer goes to the festival,

00:09:08.270 --> 00:09:09.710
picks up the pool of grits,

00:09:09.710 --> 00:09:11.280
takes it home, cuts it open,

00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:14.170
and allows his hogs to
climb in and chow down.

00:09:14.170 --> 00:09:16.240
If you liked this video and
