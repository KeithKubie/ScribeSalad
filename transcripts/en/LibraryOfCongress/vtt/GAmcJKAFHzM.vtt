00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:07.950
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:09.760
&gt;&gt; Jon Parrish Peede: Hello.

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:12.940
On behalf of my colleagues
at the National Endowment

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:19.740 position:56%
for the Humanities, I am pleased to
be with you, and our agency is proud

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.560
to be a contributor to the National
Book Festival which is hosted

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:29.110
by the Library of Congress and
it is now in its 17th year.

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:34.500
And thanks are due to David M.
Rubenstein, who is the co-chairman

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.080
of the festival and also
to the many volunteers.

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.400
And also, this pavilion is here

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:43.940
through the generosity
of Wells Fargo.

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:46.280
And also, could we
just take a moment

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.550
and recognize the Librarian
of Congress.

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:50.510
Could you just join me in
acknowledging Doctor Hayden.

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:58.050
[ Applause ]

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.020
&gt;&gt; It's wonderful to
see so many book lovers

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.080
of all ages and all walks of life.

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.920
Before this starts, I want to
ask you out of consideration

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.540
of your fellow audience
members to please turn off

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.010
or silence your cell phones.

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:18.770
There's nothing worse than hearing
one ringing in these events,

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:22.800
except for the fact that it
is ringing in your own pocket.

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.350
Again, if you might do that, it
would be very much appreciated.

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.990
It is my great pleasure to
introduce A. Scott Berg,

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.140
a Pulitzer prize-winning
biographer and editor

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.280
of the NEH supported
Library of America volume,

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.000
"World War I in America: Told
by the Americans Who Lived It."

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.300
And here's the book.

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.970
It's a beautiful book,
an exquisite book.

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:50.360
It's for sale here, and I
hope at the end of this,

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.250
that you will join the
author for the signing.

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.560
I have some notes about Scott's
biography and I'll share that,

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.100
and then I want to say a little bit

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.940
about the trade of
being a biographer.

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:05.300
Berg is the perfect
choice for this book.

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:08.810
His first book won the
National Book Award and was

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.540
about an editor, Maxwell Perkins.

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.320
And of course, you know Perkins as
the editor for F. Scott Fitzgerald,

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:19.120
for Ernest Hemingway among others.

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.310
He also wrote a biography
of Charles Lindbergh

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.370
and it also won the Pulitzer Prize.

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.850 position:56%
And of course, he has written a
biography of Woodrow Wilson as well.

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:36.100
And that very much ties into
what we're talking about today,

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:39.310
World War I on the
hundredth anniversary of it.

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:43.280
And I want to say a bit about
the craft of being a biographer.

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:44.760
Think about what it takes.

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.650
You have to be a researcher.

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.300
You have to be an editor.

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.130
You have to be an author.

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:54.670
You must have a point of view
but you must not be a partisan.

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:59.910
You must provide a vista for the
reader to have a view of history

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:03.900
without narrowing the range
of the reader's vision.

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:09.870 position:56%
That's a rare gift, and there are at
any time in any great nation only 10

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.640
or 20 people really, I think,
operating at the height

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:16.020
of the craft, and we are about
to hear from one such person.

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:19.510
So please join me in
welcoming Scott Berg.

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:27.880
[ Applause ]

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:29.180
&gt;&gt; A. Scott Berg: Thank
you very much.

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:32.090
That was a wonderful introduction.

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:33.460
I'm most appreciative.

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:37.360 position:56%
And I want to thank the National
Endowment of the Humanities as well,

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.250
which has been a great supporter
of the Library of America

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:42.760
which published this book and
has been a great supporter

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:45.340
of this book in particular.

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:50.750
This book represents something
quite special, certainly to me,

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:53.240 position:56%
and I hope to all of you ultimately.

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:56.110
Because we are celebrating,
in a way,

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:59.150
two anniversaries with this book.

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:02.400
The first is, this is
the 35th anniversary

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.520
of the Library of America.

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:07.070
I don't know if you know
about the Library of America.

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:11.530
If you don't, I don't know what
you've been doing for 35 years.

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:13.610
You should know this organization.

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:18.990
They publish America's greatest
writers in affordable, attractive,

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:23.940
authoritative, uniformly
bound books.

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:27.130
If you pick the greatest
authors in America

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:31.400
and what they do will actually
8 to 10 volumes a year.

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:35.310 position:56%
I would just add as a plug for them,
they make wonderful wedding gifts,

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:39.000
birthday gifts, anniversary
gifts, bar mitzvah gifts.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.230
So one size fits all.

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:45.160
And I urge you if you haven't
seen a Library of America book,

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:48.010
to go online and check out
the Library of America.

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:50.810
Usually they come in these
lovely little black tuxedos,

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:53.310
really just sort of
beautiful black jackets.

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:56.660
But every now and then, they do
a specialty book not on an author

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:00.470
but on a subject, and such is the
case with the book that disappeared

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:05.070
from there which is
the World War I book

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:07.580
that I was selected
to be the editor of.

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:12.140
The second anniversary,
as Jon just pointed

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:17.960
out in his a kind introduction, is
this is the hundredth anniversary

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:23.430
of America's entry into
the First World War.

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:29.090
I think World War I is the most
important and most forgotten event

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:33.550
in modern history, at least if
you live in the United States.

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:37.440
It is not that way if you're in
Europe or other parts of the world.

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:39.540
But here in America it is.

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:42.910
We all know the date 9/11.

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:46.650
We all know December 7, 1941.

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:52.600
In some ways we should
also know April 6, 1917.

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:56.150
Now it's true, America
was not invaded that day.

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:59.760
We were not attacked on that day.

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:03.450
But it is a day in
which we went to war.

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:06.780
And I think the results
of our entering that war,

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:09.820
that great conflagration
that is World War I,

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:14.710
had repercussions arguably
greater than those other two dates

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:16.730
that I've already listed.

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:21.990 position:56%
So what I'm going to do for the next
few minutes here is kind of talk

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:25.580
about my volume here
that I was asked

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:28.110
to put together about World War I.

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:33.630
And I also want to discuss some
of the impact that World War I had

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:37.010
on the United States
and had on the world.

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:38.690
Now, here was my task.

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:41.390
The Library of America came to
me and asked if I'd be interested

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:46.570
in editing a volume on World
War I as seen through the eyes

00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:48.890
and the writings of Americans.

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:53.760
And was also meant to be
all nonfiction writing.

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:58.010
Now, that threw me a little
because World War I created some

00:06:58.010 --> 00:07:01.410
of the greatest fiction this
country has ever produced,

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:03.620
the likes of Hemingway
and Fitzgerald

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:05.300
and Faulkner and Dos Passos.

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:07.670
So I'm going to do a
book on World War I

00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:10.320
but I'm not even going
to mention those people.

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:11.910
I'm going to do nonfiction.

00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:13.610
And then I thought, well great,

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:17.400
there's been some fabulous
nonfiction written by the likes

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:20.540
of Barbara Tuchman, "The
Guns of August" and so forth.

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:22.390
"No, we don't want
any of those either.

00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:25.370
We don't want books that
were written after the fact."

00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:30.390
We want nonfiction that was
written as the war was going on."

00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:36.400
So here is the task -- to
select some 100 to 150 pieces

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:41.560
that will chronicle, that will
narrate, the story of World War I,

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:45.530
we hope in its entirety
in every way.

00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:49.490
And in so doing, show a selection

00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:54.020
of the greatest American
writing from those years.

00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:55.710
So this was a daunting task.

00:07:55.710 --> 00:07:59.180
It began with -- I actually
had a wonderful team

00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:00.610
of historical advisors.

00:08:00.610 --> 00:08:03.530
I a wonderful team of editors
of the Library of America,

00:08:03.530 --> 00:08:05.410
and I think we probably started

00:08:05.410 --> 00:08:09.150
with several thousand
pieces to play with.

00:08:09.150 --> 00:08:11.060
And then we just kept winnowing it

00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:14.250
down until we were
down to a few hundred.

00:08:14.250 --> 00:08:18.380
And then the editors of the Library
of America and I went through

00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:22.830
and looked for those pieces
that most significantly, again,

00:08:22.830 --> 00:08:28.110 position:56%
addressed the two points --
displayed excellent American writing

00:08:28.110 --> 00:08:34.410
and be illustrated -- chronicle
what was going on in the war.

00:08:34.410 --> 00:08:39.260
Now, wars are just on battlefronts.

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:42.100
Wars are fought at home as well.

00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:46.570
And so the object of this book
was to try to capture, you see,

00:08:46.570 --> 00:08:50.890
what was going on domestically
as well as universally

00:08:50.890 --> 00:08:53.570
as this war was being fought.

00:08:53.570 --> 00:08:56.940
So here was the task again.

00:08:56.940 --> 00:09:01.250
Sure, I knew I was going to
begin with some great reportage.

00:09:01.250 --> 00:09:03.550
And fortunately, World
War I has some

00:09:03.550 --> 00:09:07.260
of the greatest reporters
who have ever written.

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:11.200
I mean, the likes of Richard
Harding Davis, Floyd Gibbons,

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:14.520
John Reed whom you may
know from the movie "Red."

00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:16.090
How about Nellie Bly?

00:09:16.090 --> 00:09:19.780
She was a fantastic
reporter, often forgotten.

00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:24.850
It would probably surprise most
of you as it surprised me to learn

00:09:24.850 --> 00:09:28.670
that Edith Wharton wrote some
of the greatest reportage

00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:30.560
of World War I that's
ever been done.

00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:34.060
I mean, here's Edith Wharton,
famous for the "Age of Innocence"

00:09:34.060 --> 00:09:40.140
and her other novels of society New
York at the turn-of-the-century,

00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:44.090
and yet there she was at the
front lines in Belgium and France,

00:09:44.090 --> 00:09:49.170
sending reports back of
what this war was all about.

00:09:49.170 --> 00:09:53.600
Some of the most eloquent
politicians ever were charming in,

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:57.640
needless to say, on the war, the
likes of William Jennings Bryan,

00:09:57.640 --> 00:10:00.430
Eugene Debs, and so forth.

00:10:00.430 --> 00:10:04.620
Justices -- Oliver Wendell Holmes
was writing during World War I,

00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:06.870
perhaps the greatest
writer ever to sit

00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:08.900 position:56%
on the court, certainly one of them.

00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:12.250
And yet, he had much to say because
there was so much legal activity

00:10:12.250 --> 00:10:16.330 position:56%
that was going on in the country, in
the world, that had to be dealt with

00:10:16.330 --> 00:10:17.750
and had to be discussed,

00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:21.540
most particularly alien
and sedition laws.

00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:25.360
But I also wanted to
include songwriters.

00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:27.850
What were the songs
that were being sung?

00:10:27.850 --> 00:10:30.380
Because often, they
crystallize the feelings

00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:32.630
that are being expressed
during the war.

00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:34.670
I wanted comedy.

00:10:34.670 --> 00:10:37.170
I wanted the jokes of the period.

00:10:37.170 --> 00:10:41.620
And wouldn't you know, the first
political standup comedian was

00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:44.000
during World War I.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:50.250
He was a cowboy from Oklahoma
who used to get out on a stage

00:10:50.250 --> 00:10:53.740
with a rope and he
would just twirl it.

00:10:53.740 --> 00:10:58.020
And as he would twirl it, perform a
few rope tricks, he would tell some

00:10:58.020 --> 00:11:01.630
of the most biting political
satire, often with the President

00:11:01.630 --> 00:11:05.190
of the United States sitting
right in front of him.

00:11:05.190 --> 00:11:07.620
He was the first to do it,
Woodrow Wilson, by the way,

00:11:07.620 --> 00:11:12.590
was the first president to listen
to those jokes in a theater

00:11:12.590 --> 00:11:15.790
and he loved them, by the way.

00:11:15.790 --> 00:11:19.810 position:56%
And then I wanted to capture the
voices of soldiers, needless to say.

00:11:19.810 --> 00:11:23.520
I wanted those soldiers
who had been farmers,

00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:26.120
who had suddenly been brought
over to the battlefront.

00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:30.450
Mechanics -- and I learned
something quite interesting,

00:11:30.450 --> 00:11:37.660
which was this was a period that
wasn't necessarily great literacy,

00:11:37.660 --> 00:11:42.500
even the least schooled people,
especially the young man,

00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:46.180 position:56%
the farmers and the mechanics and
so forth, who went overseas to fight

00:11:46.180 --> 00:11:50.270
in World War I, even they
were well-versed in the Bible

00:11:50.270 --> 00:11:53.040
and they knew their Shakespeare.

00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:56.880
And so, I would find
in diaries and letters

00:11:56.880 --> 00:12:02.950 position:56%
of the most common Americans the
most uncommon language and thoughts,

00:12:02.950 --> 00:12:06.740
and they really expressing
some just fantastic sentiments

00:12:06.740 --> 00:12:09.160
in the most beautiful language.

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:14.190
I wanted to get somebody like,
for example, the Army captain

00:12:14.190 --> 00:12:17.100
from Independence Missouri,
Harry Truman,

00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:21.020
who was sending love letters
back to his sweetheart,

00:12:21.020 --> 00:12:24.700
Bess Wallace in Missouri.

00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:29.400
You see what his letters
especially brought home to me,

00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:32.800 position:56%
and there are some wonderful
letters written just days before the

00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:35.470
armistice, in fact, which
are included in the volume.

00:12:35.470 --> 00:12:39.740
But what interested me about
it is when we read history

00:12:39.740 --> 00:12:44.300
of World War I, we
all know how it ends.

00:12:44.300 --> 00:12:48.350
But when you're reading diaries
and letters and reportage

00:12:48.350 --> 00:12:50.540
as the story is unfolding,

00:12:50.540 --> 00:12:53.690
those authors didn't know what
the ending was going to be.

00:12:53.690 --> 00:12:56.980
They didn't know what the results
of this battle was going to be.

00:12:56.980 --> 00:12:59.700
They didn't know what was
going to happen tomorrow.

00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:02.450
And so, there's a kind
of electricity

00:13:02.450 --> 00:13:05.980
that really runs throughout
this entire volume

00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:07.360
and was really quite exciting.

00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:09.470
And then, of course, I had to play

00:13:09.470 --> 00:13:14.300
with the man I consider the
greatest voice of the age,

00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:16.470
and that is Woodrow Wilson.

00:13:16.470 --> 00:13:19.750
And I think ultimately this is why
the Library of America asked me

00:13:19.750 --> 00:13:22.960
if I would help put this book
together, if I would edit it

00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:26.030
and write an introduction to
it and write the headpieces

00:13:26.030 --> 00:13:29.140
for the 130 selections
we have in the book.

00:13:29.140 --> 00:13:32.820
And that is because
Wilson was the great voice,

00:13:32.820 --> 00:13:37.670
he was the engine behind this era

00:13:37.670 --> 00:13:41.980
and he was certainly the engine
behind the United States going

00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:43.280
to war.

00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:48.580
And he was, as it happens, not only
the most educated president we have

00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:53.840
ever had to this day, he is
the only president we've had

00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:56.450
who not only got a bachelors degree

00:13:56.450 --> 00:13:59.660
but then studied law
and then he got a PhD.

00:13:59.660 --> 00:14:03.300
He is, to this day, our
only president with a PhD.

00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:06.140
But he also was extremely eloquent.

00:14:06.140 --> 00:14:09.760
And they're just two or three
other presidents I would put

00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:11.080
in the same category.

00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:15.310
I don't want to shortchange
Lincoln, Thomas Jefferson,

00:14:15.310 --> 00:14:20.430
but Woodrow Wilson is definitely in
the top tier of American presidents

00:14:20.430 --> 00:14:23.690
and I would also add -
and this is most important

00:14:23.690 --> 00:14:25.700
for the book I was
putting together --

00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:29.300
Woodrow Wilson is the
last president we had

00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:32.600
who wrote every word that he spoke.

00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:35.050
He did not work with speechwriters.

00:14:35.050 --> 00:14:37.800
So when you see a Woodrow
Wilson speech,

00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:41.990
that meant Woodrow Wilson
sat down and wrote it.

00:14:41.990 --> 00:14:43.750
And what I mean, he
sat down and wrote it,

00:14:43.750 --> 00:14:46.170
I mean not with a secretary.

00:14:46.170 --> 00:14:48.330
I mean he sat down
with a shorthand pad

00:14:48.330 --> 00:14:50.200 position:56%
because he knew how to do shorthand.

00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:52.860
He would write his first
drafts in shorthand and then,

00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:56.800
because he was probably the
best typist in the White House,

00:14:56.800 --> 00:15:01.110
he then typed his rough drafts and
then he would make notes on them.

00:15:01.110 --> 00:15:03.040
And then he might give
them to somebody else

00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:05.450
to type, but generally not.

00:15:05.450 --> 00:15:09.730
So these are the voices
I had to play

00:15:09.730 --> 00:15:13.180
with in putting this book together.

00:15:13.180 --> 00:15:19.230
Now, as I was gathering all these
pieces, I began to see I knew I had

00:15:19.230 --> 00:15:21.620
to write an introduction
for the piece to kind

00:15:21.620 --> 00:15:26.310
of condense the entire World
War into 10 or 15 pages.

00:15:26.310 --> 00:15:30.780
But I noticed a theme that I
hadn't seen discussed before

00:15:30.780 --> 00:15:33.130 position:56%
that I think is extremely important.

00:15:33.130 --> 00:15:37.890
And it is this -- I think World
War I in large measure was

00:15:37.890 --> 00:15:40.380
about the subject of identity.

00:15:40.380 --> 00:15:45.240
The war got started
in Europe in 1914

00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:48.570
because there were
really four great empires

00:15:48.570 --> 00:15:51.260
that owned so much of the world.

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:54.710
And these empires, some
of them were so huge

00:15:54.710 --> 00:15:59.200
that they really embraced
communities that had nothing to do

00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:02.480
with each other, nationalities,
creeds, races.

00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:07.720
And they were so far apart just
geographically, to say nothing

00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:12.670
of morally, historically, socially,
every which way you might want

00:16:12.670 --> 00:16:16.010
to slice and dice these
particular empires.

00:16:16.010 --> 00:16:20.680
And so, I began to see, and in fact
the assassination of an archduke

00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:25.550
that ignited World War I
was by somebody saying,

00:16:25.550 --> 00:16:31.030
"I don't really feel as though
I'm in Austro-Hungarian.

00:16:31.030 --> 00:16:34.450
There are Serbs, and we want
to be treated a certain way,

00:16:34.450 --> 00:16:36.540
and Bosnians a certain way."

00:16:36.540 --> 00:16:39.540
And so, that's what
tripped off to war,

00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:43.930
this feeling that people were
searching for their identities.

00:16:43.930 --> 00:16:48.950 position:56%
Europe went to war of course because
then there is a great feeling

00:16:48.950 --> 00:16:51.910
of militarism, especially
in Germany.

00:16:51.910 --> 00:16:55.090
There was a great rising
tide of nationalism.

00:16:55.090 --> 00:16:57.300
So nationalism is really
nothing more

00:16:57.300 --> 00:17:01.040
than the expression of
identity, of course.

00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:04.410
And then there was a system
of alliances that kicked in.

00:17:04.410 --> 00:17:08.650
There had been treaties made over
the prior centuries and decades

00:17:08.650 --> 00:17:12.830
that made it so that once
war broke out somewhere,

00:17:12.830 --> 00:17:16.110 position:56%
another country was going to come in
and another country in retaliation.

00:17:16.110 --> 00:17:19.960
And the next thing you
knew, the world was at war.

00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:21.770
And so, that really brings

00:17:21.770 --> 00:17:25.740
in to mind what is the
United States supposed to do?

00:17:25.740 --> 00:17:29.110
Here is the United
States, a country thousands

00:17:29.110 --> 00:17:32.470 position:56%
of miles away, buffered by an ocean.

00:17:32.470 --> 00:17:34.530
We're quite safe here.

00:17:34.530 --> 00:17:38.140
But the United States
is now a teenage nation.

00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:42.060
It's in its 13th or 14th decade.

00:17:42.060 --> 00:17:47.910
And what is the United States'
role, if any, in this war abroad?

00:17:47.910 --> 00:17:53.550
As the world is shrinking, as
communications, as transportation,

00:17:53.550 --> 00:17:59.110 position:56%
is making it so that some event that
happens in the middle of Germany

00:17:59.110 --> 00:18:02.070
or in the middle of the
Austro-Hungarian Empire is going

00:18:02.070 --> 00:18:06.050
to have some affect on
what's going on in St. Louis

00:18:06.050 --> 00:18:08.770
or New Jersey or California.

00:18:08.770 --> 00:18:12.030
So all these things
had to be considered.

00:18:12.030 --> 00:18:16.630
The president of the United
States had a very firm feeling.

00:18:16.630 --> 00:18:21.140
Woodrow Wilson thought the United
States should stay out of this war,

00:18:21.140 --> 00:18:24.650
that it really did not
involve the United States

00:18:24.650 --> 00:18:28.070
or at least it shouldn't
involve us militarily.

00:18:28.070 --> 00:18:32.580
And so, he thought the best thing
we could do was remain neutral,

00:18:32.580 --> 00:18:37.240
not just militarily but
even in thought, he said.

00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:38.890
Because the United
States, of course,

00:18:38.890 --> 00:18:41.720
is made up of German-Americans,

00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:45.050
Russian-Americans,
English-Americans.

00:18:45.050 --> 00:18:48.060 position:56%
So which side are we meant to be on?

00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:52.630
And ultimately, he was arguing for
something called Americanism --

00:18:52.630 --> 00:18:56.090
that we should just be
Americans, that this was a moment

00:18:56.090 --> 00:19:00.420
and this is an identity
question where Wilson was arguing

00:19:00.420 --> 00:19:04.890
for the fact that the United States
should get rid of its hyphens

00:19:04.890 --> 00:19:08.680
and that we should now
just become Americans.

00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:14.100
So this was a great, great thing,
and this is largely, as I said,

00:19:14.100 --> 00:19:16.280
what my introduction is about.

00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:20.040
And in the 130-odd
pieces in the book,

00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:23.970
you will just see it just
happened to be that this thread

00:19:23.970 --> 00:19:28.690
of identity just keeps running
through it, personal identity,

00:19:28.690 --> 00:19:32.610
national identity, and even
identity as human beings.

00:19:32.610 --> 00:19:33.910
Who are we?

00:19:33.910 --> 00:19:38.040
So what happened was, as
the war kept going on,

00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:41.530
there was the great
debate in this country.

00:19:41.530 --> 00:19:44.950
You know, the United
States has had a couple

00:19:44.950 --> 00:19:47.910
of great debates in its lifetime.

00:19:47.910 --> 00:19:50.940
The first one was obviously when
the nation was being foundered

00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:54.480
and the revolution,
the Federalist Papers

00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:57.710
that forged the Constitution
and a country.

00:19:57.710 --> 00:20:02.770
We had another great debate
in this country from the 1840s

00:20:02.770 --> 00:20:05.850
on until really the
Civil War came about.

00:20:05.850 --> 00:20:09.110
And that was yet another
identity issue.

00:20:09.110 --> 00:20:12.830
Are we in fact United States here?

00:20:12.830 --> 00:20:14.130
That was one.

00:20:14.130 --> 00:20:17.080
We had a great debate
during World War II.

00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:19.020
Should this country go to war.

00:20:19.020 --> 00:20:20.850
This is just before Pearl Harbor

00:20:20.850 --> 00:20:24.280
when the America First
Movement really took off

00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:29.360
between 1939,1840 into 1941.

00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:34.260
Was it America's role to go
to war and fight overseas,

00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:35.980
either in Asia or in Europe?

00:20:35.980 --> 00:20:38.020
But one of the great debates - Oh,

00:20:38.020 --> 00:20:42.060
Vietnam was obviously another
important great debate.

00:20:42.060 --> 00:20:45.110
But one of the most
interesting of the great debates,

00:20:45.110 --> 00:20:50.930
if not the most interesting, was
the great debate about World War I,

00:20:50.930 --> 00:20:53.690
because we had not been attacked.

00:20:53.690 --> 00:20:57.820
And this became a debate
about ideas.

00:20:57.820 --> 00:21:00.560
What is the role of
the United States?

00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:02.520
What is our identity?

00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:05.180
What are we meant to do?

00:21:05.180 --> 00:21:07.960
And I hear the voice of
Woodrow Wilson yelling at me.

00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:10.460
"No Scott, it's not ideas.

00:21:10.460 --> 00:21:12.710
It's ideals."

00:21:12.710 --> 00:21:17.520 position:56%
And Woodrow Wilson, for three years,
believed, as I said, we should stay

00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:21.500
out of this war as the likes
of Teddy Roosevelt was arguing

00:21:21.500 --> 00:21:24.420
to bring us into the war.

00:21:24.420 --> 00:21:30.880
And gradually, Wilson who was a
great Anglophile himself but tried

00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:35.280
to live up to his own
rule of neutrality,

00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:39.800
found that we just couldn't
look the other way any longer.

00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:43.510
And when he saw what was going
on in Belgium, when he saw --

00:21:43.510 --> 00:21:47.740 position:56%
and I hope you read Edith
Wharton's dispatches from Belgium --

00:21:47.740 --> 00:21:51.730
and when he saw the hideous things,
the atrocities that were going

00:21:51.730 --> 00:21:56.630
on in this war, gradually
Wilson believed, "No,

00:21:56.630 --> 00:21:59.920
this is something we
better start preparing for."

00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:06.140
And as the years went on, 1914,
1915, it's now up to 1916.

00:22:06.140 --> 00:22:12.550
Woodrow Wilson got reelected on the
slogan, "He kept us out of war,"

00:22:12.550 --> 00:22:15.030
and that was a very good thing.

00:22:15.030 --> 00:22:21.060
But by the time he was
inaugurated in March 1917,

00:22:21.060 --> 00:22:24.720
something had been released
called the Zimmerman Telegram

00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:27.890
which was this secret
document that revealed

00:22:27.890 --> 00:22:32.830
that Germany was then colluding
with Mexico, trying to get them

00:22:32.830 --> 00:22:36.550
into the war to come to fight
against the United States,

00:22:36.550 --> 00:22:41.870
promising them territories back if
they would come in with Germany.

00:22:41.870 --> 00:22:44.870
And that was really a
kind of tipping point

00:22:44.870 --> 00:22:48.070
for the United States
and for Woodrow Wilson.

00:22:48.070 --> 00:22:55.380
And on April 2, 1917,
Woodrow Wilson gave a speech

00:22:55.380 --> 00:23:01.410
that I think is the single most
important foreign policy speech

00:23:01.410 --> 00:23:04.550
in American history, because in

00:23:04.550 --> 00:23:11.550
that speech Woodrow Wilson famously
implanted a single sentence.

00:23:11.550 --> 00:23:19.000
And that sentence is, "The world
must be made safe for democracy."

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:21.650
Now, when he said that to a
joint session of Congress,

00:23:21.650 --> 00:23:26.160
at first they didn't know
what he meant exactly.

00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:30.710
But in a second or two,
they realized what it meant

00:23:30.710 --> 00:23:34.010
and they burst into huge applause.

00:23:34.010 --> 00:23:36.580
And that's line, whether
you understand it or not,

00:23:36.580 --> 00:23:39.620
whether you agree with it or not,
whether you believe it or not,

00:23:39.620 --> 00:23:45.580
has been the bedrock of
all American foreign policy

00:23:45.580 --> 00:23:48.770
for the last hundred years.

00:23:48.770 --> 00:23:53.490
Every incursion by the
United States anywhere

00:23:53.490 --> 00:23:59.790
since that time has really been
based on that single principle,

00:23:59.790 --> 00:24:04.530
that single sentence of making
the world safe for democracy.

00:24:04.530 --> 00:24:06.950
Is that nation building?

00:24:06.950 --> 00:24:08.250
That is to be decided.

00:24:08.250 --> 00:24:11.940
That line, "The world must
be made safe for democracy,"

00:24:11.940 --> 00:24:13.880
has often been used by presidents.

00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:16.790
It has often been abused
by presidents.

00:24:16.790 --> 00:24:23.010 position:56%
Again, like it or not, it has been
what has compelled the United States

00:24:23.010 --> 00:24:26.800
to take action for 100 years.

00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:32.970
What Wilson was basically trying
to state and what he was adding

00:24:32.970 --> 00:24:37.400
to the formula here
was a moral component

00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:39.980
to American foreign policy.

00:24:39.980 --> 00:24:43.890
And he was basically saying,
"How can we, the United States,

00:24:43.890 --> 00:24:46.890
look at what is happening
to Belgium.

00:24:46.890 --> 00:24:51.290
Germany trampling over this tiny
country for the simple reason

00:24:51.290 --> 00:24:54.250
that it stood between
Germany and France

00:24:54.250 --> 00:24:56.020
and they had to get across it.

00:24:56.020 --> 00:24:57.320
Ad they conquered it.

00:24:57.320 --> 00:24:58.620
They burned it.

00:24:58.620 --> 00:25:01.000
They did terrible things
to the Belgians,

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:04.820
who did nothing to bring it on.

00:25:04.820 --> 00:25:09.320
And what was happening elsewhere
in Europe, mostly at the hands

00:25:09.320 --> 00:25:14.580
of the Hun as the German was known,
that became compelling enough

00:25:14.580 --> 00:25:18.060
to Wilson to lead us into this war.

00:25:18.060 --> 00:25:21.760
That now, part of the
American identity, you see,

00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:25.180
was to be a great champion
of democracy.

00:25:25.180 --> 00:25:27.190
And so it was.

00:25:27.190 --> 00:25:31.450
Now, in this moment,
the United States

00:25:31.450 --> 00:25:35.540
of America was a neutral country.

00:25:35.540 --> 00:25:41.990
We had a standing army of
about 150,000 soldiers.

00:25:41.990 --> 00:25:46.030 position:56%
If you made a list of all the armies
of the countries of the world,

00:25:46.030 --> 00:25:49.970
we were somewhere around 16 or 17.

00:25:49.970 --> 00:25:55.020
We were somewhere between
Portugal and Serbia.

00:25:55.020 --> 00:25:57.810
That's who the United States was.

00:25:57.810 --> 00:26:02.170
And now, over the next
year or two, Woodrow Wilson

00:26:02.170 --> 00:26:06.930
as commander-in-chief, intended to
change that and turn this country

00:26:06.930 --> 00:26:11.080
into the greatest fighting
force the world had ever seen.

00:26:11.080 --> 00:26:12.510
And that's what he did.

00:26:12.510 --> 00:26:19.430
Over the next few years, he
mobilized some 4 million young men,

00:26:19.430 --> 00:26:23.090
most of whom were in the Army,
but we also then needed a Navy

00:26:23.090 --> 00:26:28.220
to transport all those
soldiers overseas.

00:26:28.220 --> 00:26:32.400
This was the moment that a
sleeping giant basically awakened

00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:37.880
and became the first
modern superpower.

00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:43.350
Now, I mentioned that this
Great War is happening overseas.

00:26:43.350 --> 00:26:49.520
It's happening mostly in France
and Belgium having been trod upon.

00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:51.450
So there's France just
getting shut up,

00:26:51.450 --> 00:26:54.830
and it took a while before
we could muster an army

00:26:54.830 --> 00:26:57.150
and send them over there.

00:26:57.150 --> 00:27:02.680
In that period, the war was
really being fought here at home.

00:27:02.680 --> 00:27:07.720
And this is the moment where
America really goes to war,

00:27:07.720 --> 00:27:11.410
because the American
identity changed

00:27:11.410 --> 00:27:15.560
so dramatically over the next year.

00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:19.170
And here are just some
takeaways for you.

00:27:19.170 --> 00:27:23.910
You know, when I said how
impactful World War I was,

00:27:23.910 --> 00:27:29.280 position:56%
here are some examples of what we
live with today because of something

00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:32.230
that happened a hundred years ago.

00:27:32.230 --> 00:27:37.570
This is the moment that the
federal government went really big.

00:27:37.570 --> 00:27:41.790
In order to wage a war on the scale
that Woodrow Wilson felt we had to,

00:27:41.790 --> 00:27:43.780
we suddenly had an alphabet soup.

00:27:43.780 --> 00:27:46.650
We had thousands of
boards, agencies,

00:27:46.650 --> 00:27:48.890
committees, and commissions.

00:27:48.890 --> 00:27:53.570
Woodrow Wilson hired the
biggest men in American business

00:27:53.570 --> 00:27:56.670
to form committees,
a war trade board

00:27:56.670 --> 00:27:59.060
that was headed by Bernard Baruch.

00:27:59.060 --> 00:28:02.580
This was really the beginning,
although they didn't use this term.

00:28:02.580 --> 00:28:04.690
This was generally the beginning

00:28:04.690 --> 00:28:08.760
of a military-industrial
complex in this country.

00:28:08.760 --> 00:28:12.610
It was also a moment
strangely 's that was very good

00:28:12.610 --> 00:28:14.590
and important for the Jews.

00:28:14.590 --> 00:28:17.290
Not just American Jews,
but Jews around the world,

00:28:17.290 --> 00:28:20.510
there was something called the
Balfour Declaration which called

00:28:20.510 --> 00:28:23.980
for a national home
for the Jewish people,

00:28:23.980 --> 00:28:30.740
something that is being discussed
in the British Parliament.

00:28:30.740 --> 00:28:35.040
And Wilson's advisors advised him
not to have anything to do with it.

00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:36.340
Don't make any comment.

00:28:36.340 --> 00:28:38.040
But Wilson said, "Too late.

00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:39.450
I already made it very clear.

00:28:39.450 --> 00:28:41.590
I support this declaration."

00:28:41.590 --> 00:28:47.960
And so, in essence, in 1917 the
United States really became the

00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:53.590
first country beyond
Britain and Palestine itself

00:28:53.590 --> 00:28:56.700
to acknowledge the fact that
there should be a national home

00:28:56.700 --> 00:28:58.000
for Jewish people.

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:01.960
The economy changed drastically.

00:29:01.960 --> 00:29:05.590
Now, Woodrow Wilson did
not invent the income tax

00:29:05.590 --> 00:29:11.730
but he certainly modernized it,
and what had once been 1% on $3000

00:29:11.730 --> 00:29:17.520
of income doubled to 2% on $1000.

00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:23.180
Surtaxes were levied,
some as high as 67%.

00:29:23.180 --> 00:29:27.030
There were war profits
taxes that were introduced.

00:29:27.030 --> 00:29:30.870
So you now see this great
infusion of federal government.

00:29:30.870 --> 00:29:33.610
You know, to this day,
there are some people --

00:29:33.610 --> 00:29:37.210
I've heard it on TV --
the likes of Glenn Beck.

00:29:37.210 --> 00:29:43.610
I remember he once did a list
of the worst people in history,

00:29:43.610 --> 00:29:47.430
and there was Hitler and
Mussolini and Stalin.

00:29:47.430 --> 00:29:50.520
And there at the top of the
list, he had Woodrow Wilson.

00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:55.420
And it was because, I think,
of what he felt Wilson had done

00:29:55.420 --> 00:30:00.930
to this nation by making
this huge federal structure

00:30:00.930 --> 00:30:04.220
that was basically
not going to go away.

00:30:04.220 --> 00:30:10.250
Indeed, the federal deficit went
from $1 billion to $9 billion.

00:30:10.250 --> 00:30:12.020
We had war bonds.

00:30:12.020 --> 00:30:15.050
You know, during the election
season, we often hear about

00:30:15.050 --> 00:30:20.300
and think about and see Hollywood
joining hands with Washington.

00:30:20.300 --> 00:30:27.330 position:56%
The first link in that relationship
was actually made during World War I

00:30:27.330 --> 00:30:31.520 position:56%
when Wilson called upon movie stars.

00:30:31.520 --> 00:30:33.070
This was a brand-new phenomenon.

00:30:33.070 --> 00:30:37.280
Movie star, silent film stars,
Mary Pickford, Charlie Chaplin,

00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:41.130
Douglas Fairbanks, William S.
Hart the great stone-faced cowboy

00:30:41.130 --> 00:30:43.260
in silent pictures.

00:30:43.260 --> 00:30:46.390
They went out and actually
went to rallies

00:30:46.390 --> 00:30:50.130
and raised money for war bonds.

00:30:50.130 --> 00:30:54.950
There was something that Wilson
introduced to the Congress,

00:30:54.950 --> 00:30:58.220
something called a debt ceiling.

00:30:58.220 --> 00:31:02.680
This began as a tool for the
United States Treasury Department

00:31:02.680 --> 00:31:05.880
so that Wilson didn't have to go

00:31:05.880 --> 00:31:09.750
to Congress each time he
wanted to float a bond.

00:31:09.750 --> 00:31:12.950
He just said to the Congress,
"Why don't you set a debt ceiling,

00:31:12.950 --> 00:31:15.910
and whenever we need
to float another bond,

00:31:15.910 --> 00:31:18.040
maybe we'll raise the debt ceiling.

00:31:18.040 --> 00:31:20.210
We'll see what happens with that."

00:31:20.210 --> 00:31:24.300
And the fact, the Army and Navy,
of course, built up, as I told you,

00:31:24.300 --> 00:31:28.540
from some 100,000-150,000
to 4 million.

00:31:28.540 --> 00:31:32.560
The Navy went from
60,000 to 500,000.

00:31:32.560 --> 00:31:37.660
We had a selective service
system for the first time.

00:31:37.660 --> 00:31:42.110
Now, this meant that there was
a local board in every community

00:31:42.110 --> 00:31:45.910
that was going to determine
which of its young men were going

00:31:45.910 --> 00:31:48.080
to be going overseas.

00:31:48.080 --> 00:31:51.910
This matter ultimately
that a Harvard scion,

00:31:51.910 --> 00:31:57.090
some rich kid from Massachusetts,
might be sharing a trench, you see,

00:31:57.090 --> 00:32:01.080
with some farm boy from Missouri.

00:32:01.080 --> 00:32:06.380 position:56%
So this really shook up the economy.

00:32:06.380 --> 00:32:08.380
Wars are game changers.

00:32:08.380 --> 00:32:12.970
They just shake up all the pieces
and you see how it settles down.

00:32:12.970 --> 00:32:16.880
And it really affected
another part of American life

00:32:16.880 --> 00:32:19.540
that had long been
overlooked or dismissed,

00:32:19.540 --> 00:32:25.630
and that was the African
American, the black man, the Negro.

00:32:25.630 --> 00:32:31.270
There were still segregated units,
trenches, and burials for blacks

00:32:31.270 --> 00:32:35.290
who wanted to serve, and they
did suffer twice the death rate

00:32:35.290 --> 00:32:38.040
that the white soldiers did.

00:32:38.040 --> 00:32:43.660
But in fact, some 40,000
African Americans did go overseas

00:32:43.660 --> 00:32:46.290
and took part in combat.

00:32:46.290 --> 00:32:48.420
They didn't always fight
shoulder to shoulder.

00:32:48.420 --> 00:32:51.060
In fact, they did not
with white soldiers,

00:32:51.060 --> 00:32:54.590
but they were at least
on the same side.

00:32:54.590 --> 00:32:58.280
Now, as a result of this,
several things happened.

00:32:58.280 --> 00:33:01.720
Because they were shorthanded
in the South especially,

00:33:01.720 --> 00:33:07.070
there was a migration of
African Americans moving north.

00:33:07.070 --> 00:33:10.240
And then perhaps the greatest
thing that happened as result

00:33:10.240 --> 00:33:14.410
of World War I is in the aftermath.

00:33:14.410 --> 00:33:18.370
Because, you know, African
Americans had a real dilemma.

00:33:18.370 --> 00:33:21.710
Why should we be going overseas?

00:33:21.710 --> 00:33:27.120
Why should we be fighting for
peace and freedom for Belgians

00:33:27.120 --> 00:33:30.920
when we don't really have peace or
freedom here in the United States

00:33:30.920 --> 00:33:34.490
when we are second if not
third class citizens?"

00:33:34.490 --> 00:33:39.870
So it was a real decision for an
African American to go overseas.

00:33:39.870 --> 00:33:43.240
But by and large the thinking was,

00:33:43.240 --> 00:33:49.130
we must do it because we will come
back as full-fledged Americans.

00:33:49.130 --> 00:33:51.980
Our mothers will see sons
shedding the same blood

00:33:51.980 --> 00:33:53.540
that white mothers do.

00:33:53.540 --> 00:33:57.560
Some of us may not come home,
but this is an opportunity for us

00:33:57.560 --> 00:34:03.290
to win our red badges of courage
and to come back as Americans.

00:34:03.290 --> 00:34:07.570
And they did come back, and
unfortunately they discovered

00:34:07.570 --> 00:34:10.110
that they were treated
just as badly,

00:34:10.110 --> 00:34:13.130 position:56%
if not worse, than before they left.

00:34:13.130 --> 00:34:20.760
And this actually, I think, is the
darkest mark against Woodrow Wilson

00:34:20.760 --> 00:34:23.220
in his entire presidency.

00:34:23.220 --> 00:34:28.470
And that is, Woodrow Wilson, our
educator-in-chief, our smartest man

00:34:28.470 --> 00:34:31.660
who has ever been in the White
House, he was a Southerner,

00:34:31.660 --> 00:34:34.710
and he did have more
than racist tendencies.

00:34:34.710 --> 00:34:39.750 position:56%
But this was a moment when all these
soldiers came home that I think he,

00:34:39.750 --> 00:34:46.110
being a Southerner and a
somewhat reconstructed racist,

00:34:46.110 --> 00:34:50.830
could have said to America, "These
men have fought just the way

00:34:50.830 --> 00:34:52.130
that white men have fought,

00:34:52.130 --> 00:34:55.580
and we must now embrace
them in American society."

00:34:55.580 --> 00:34:59.690
And in fact, he said
nothing on the subject.

00:34:59.690 --> 00:35:03.970
And as a result of it,
in 1919 we had something

00:35:03.970 --> 00:35:06.800
that we now call the Red Summer.

00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:11.150 position:56%
And it was called the Red Summer
because there was so much bloodshed.

00:35:11.150 --> 00:35:15.950
Riots broke out in two dozen
cities and they were horrific.

00:35:15.950 --> 00:35:17.780
They were really terrible.

00:35:17.780 --> 00:35:21.670
But really coming out of the ashes

00:35:21.670 --> 00:35:25.380
of these riots is the
civil rights movement.

00:35:25.380 --> 00:35:30.460
It really gets born as a
result of the First World War.

00:35:30.460 --> 00:35:33.620
The labor situation
changed to such an extent

00:35:33.620 --> 00:35:39.240
that even women were welcome
to take jobs outside the home.

00:35:39.240 --> 00:35:46.430
It was a concept we had seen signs
of before, but we had never seen it

00:35:46.430 --> 00:35:50.550 position:56%
in any seriously measurable numbers.

00:35:50.550 --> 00:35:53.340
But now, women were taking
jobs outside the home.

00:35:53.340 --> 00:35:55.270
There were bad statistics
in the beginning,

00:35:55.270 --> 00:35:56.780
but let me put it this way.

00:35:56.780 --> 00:36:02.230
Even black women no longer had
to work merely as domestics.

00:36:02.230 --> 00:36:08.040
They could get jobs as elevator
operators or cafeteria waitresses.

00:36:08.040 --> 00:36:09.340
And the other thing that happened

00:36:09.340 --> 00:36:12.570
for women during this period
is that they got the vote.

00:36:12.570 --> 00:36:16.150
And they got the vote because
Woodrow Wilson went to Congress

00:36:16.150 --> 00:36:17.880
and said, "You know what?

00:36:17.880 --> 00:36:21.550
Suffrage, this is now
a wartime measure."

00:36:21.550 --> 00:36:26.010
And he went to Congress and he
said, "We cannot really be fighting

00:36:26.010 --> 00:36:27.690
for peace and freedom abroad

00:36:27.690 --> 00:36:31.850
when half our own subjects do not
have this the ability to vote,

00:36:31.850 --> 00:36:34.730
to have a say in what
the government is."

00:36:34.730 --> 00:36:36.710
And so, he argued extensively,

00:36:36.710 --> 00:36:41.900
and as soon as the war was
over, women did get the vote.

00:36:41.900 --> 00:36:43.980
Now, you've got 4 million soldiers

00:36:43.980 --> 00:36:46.620
and you've got people
starving all over Europe.

00:36:46.620 --> 00:36:48.790 position:56%
You've got to feed all these people,

00:36:48.790 --> 00:36:53.200
and America in that moment becomes
the great breadbasket of the world.

00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:56.890
The way some of the European
countries were using food

00:36:56.890 --> 00:36:59.800
as a weapon, blockades
keeping people

00:36:59.800 --> 00:37:01.520
on the continent from getting food.

00:37:01.520 --> 00:37:06.370
The United States realized we
could use food as a great tool,

00:37:06.370 --> 00:37:10.410
and indeed we really
began to feed the world.

00:37:10.410 --> 00:37:13.460
We became the great
breadbasket of the world.

00:37:13.460 --> 00:37:17.060
We went on next hours each day.

00:37:17.060 --> 00:37:18.360
You know what?

00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:20.790
Every year we have
daylight savings time.

00:37:20.790 --> 00:37:23.090
That's because of World War I.

00:37:23.090 --> 00:37:26.090
It all goes back to that
because Woodrow Wilson figured

00:37:26.090 --> 00:37:30.350
if we have an extra hour of
sunlight every day, we can harvest

00:37:30.350 --> 00:37:32.940
that much more food every day.

00:37:32.940 --> 00:37:35.750
Well, the United States,
of course, won the war.

00:37:35.750 --> 00:37:40.960
We finally got into it, actually
fighting in the spring of 1918.

00:37:40.960 --> 00:37:45.590
Within six months, the
war was fought and won

00:37:45.590 --> 00:37:50.270
because the United States
troops, they not only proved

00:37:50.270 --> 00:37:54.160
to be a very good fighting machine,
but they were fresh soldiers

00:37:54.160 --> 00:37:57.160
after this battle had
just been going on.

00:37:57.160 --> 00:38:01.290
It was a real stalemate until
the American soldiers got in.

00:38:01.290 --> 00:38:05.120
Wilson brought us into the First
World War because he believed

00:38:05.120 --> 00:38:09.010
if we got in, we could
help write the peace.

00:38:09.010 --> 00:38:12.780
And Wilson had a great plan
for the future of the world.

00:38:12.780 --> 00:38:15.750
That's all.

00:38:15.750 --> 00:38:19.740
Wilson narrowed it
down to 14 points,

00:38:19.740 --> 00:38:22.220
and some of them were quite
specific about borders

00:38:22.220 --> 00:38:26.400
and some were general
things about the seas

00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:28.820
and the laws that govern the world.

00:38:28.820 --> 00:38:33.360
But he had one important point,
and that was his 14th point,

00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:37.530
which was the creation of something
he called a League of Nations.

00:38:37.530 --> 00:38:42.430 position:56%
And Woodrow Wilson believed if every
country would sign on to the League

00:38:42.430 --> 00:38:46.670
of Nations and agreed to sit
down at a table with each other

00:38:46.670 --> 00:38:49.330
and they must bring any
disagreements they have

00:38:49.330 --> 00:38:52.210
to this table before they
would ever go to war.

00:38:52.210 --> 00:38:56.860 position:56%
Because if you did go to war against
a country in the League of Nations,

00:38:56.860 --> 00:39:00.950
you would be facing everyone
else in the League of Nations.

00:39:00.950 --> 00:39:06.200
In essence, Woodrow Wilson was
introducing collective security.

00:39:06.200 --> 00:39:10.420
This comes out, you
see, of World War I.

00:39:10.420 --> 00:39:15.430
And self-determination, that was
one of the keys to the 14 points,

00:39:15.430 --> 00:39:18.120
that every country around
the world should be able

00:39:18.120 --> 00:39:21.820
to determine its own
political future.

00:39:21.820 --> 00:39:25.040
The results of the
war were enormous.

00:39:25.040 --> 00:39:27.550
We won this war.

00:39:27.550 --> 00:39:30.320 position:56%
It changed the American personality.

00:39:30.320 --> 00:39:35.340
Suddenly the United States became
a genuinely extrovert nation.

00:39:35.340 --> 00:39:40.840
Belgium was restored, Alsace was
returned, Poland was recognized.

00:39:40.840 --> 00:39:45.680
There were lots of problems with
the 14 points with the treaty

00:39:45.680 --> 00:39:50.300
that was ultimately signed in
Versailles, the most important

00:39:50.300 --> 00:39:53.740
of which was done at the
very last minute really,

00:39:53.740 --> 00:39:56.400
when some agreement was made

00:39:56.400 --> 00:40:00.010
that gave Japan a great
advantage over China.

00:40:00.010 --> 00:40:06.380
And as a result of that,
there was a huge outburst

00:40:06.380 --> 00:40:11.720
in China on May 4, 1919.

00:40:11.720 --> 00:40:15.220
It was really the beginning, the
seeds of a revolution over there.

00:40:15.220 --> 00:40:19.860
And it incited the likes of a
very young man named Mao Tse-Tung

00:40:19.860 --> 00:40:23.290
and a whole generation
of young Chinese,

00:40:23.290 --> 00:40:27.890
largely students I might add,
really became the generation

00:40:27.890 --> 00:40:31.490
that created the Great
Revolution in China.

00:40:31.490 --> 00:40:37.460
And as a result of that, you
see, I think the tentacles

00:40:37.460 --> 00:40:42.360
of World War spread everywhere.

00:40:42.360 --> 00:40:45.830
Now, I'm going to leave you
with one reading from the book,

00:40:45.830 --> 00:40:48.720
one very brief reading
from this book

00:40:48.720 --> 00:40:52.530
that I put together on World War I.

00:40:52.530 --> 00:41:00.980
It's something that Woodrow Wilson
said on Memorial Day, May 30, 1919.

00:41:00.980 --> 00:41:03.820
The treaty hadn't yet been signed.

00:41:03.820 --> 00:41:05.120
Everything had been discussed.

00:41:05.120 --> 00:41:07.210
Everything had been agreed upon.

00:41:07.210 --> 00:41:10.960
Just a few details
remaining to be settled.

00:41:10.960 --> 00:41:14.900
And on Memorial Day, Woodrow
Wilson and his wife drove

00:41:14.900 --> 00:41:19.650
out to an American
cemetery just outside Paris.

00:41:19.650 --> 00:41:22.680
It was close enough to Paris that
you can actually see the spoke

00:41:22.680 --> 00:41:25.460
of the Eiffel Tower
off in the background.

00:41:25.460 --> 00:41:30.440
And there, Woodrow Wilson walked
out before hundreds of thousands

00:41:30.440 --> 00:41:32.690
of graves, the white crosses.

00:41:32.690 --> 00:41:35.330
You've seen pictures
of it time and again.

00:41:35.330 --> 00:41:39.270
And Woodrow Wilson, who could
barely contain himself --

00:41:39.270 --> 00:41:41.750
there were lots of French mothers

00:41:41.750 --> 00:41:43.610
and families scattered
all around this.

00:41:43.610 --> 00:41:45.350
But this was an American cemetery

00:41:45.350 --> 00:41:49.280
and the French had planted an
American flag at every grave.

00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:53.630
And Wilson got out there and
he did a very eloquent speech.

00:41:53.630 --> 00:41:57.290
The speech was finished,
they fought.

00:41:57.290 --> 00:42:02.660
And then, Wilson said -- this
is hard for me to read --

00:42:02.660 --> 00:42:06.290
"If I may speak a personal word.

00:42:06.290 --> 00:42:11.220 position:56%
I beg you," he said to his
audience, "to realize the compulsion

00:42:11.220 --> 00:42:14.310
that I myself feel that I am under.

00:42:14.310 --> 00:42:16.640
By the Constitution
of our great country,

00:42:16.640 --> 00:42:19.970
I was the commander-in-chief
of these men.

00:42:19.970 --> 00:42:26.680
I advised the Congress to
declare a state of war.

00:42:26.680 --> 00:42:31.210
I sent these lads over here to die.

00:42:31.210 --> 00:42:36.490
Shall I, can I, ever speak a word
of counsel which is inconsistent

00:42:36.490 --> 00:42:39.650
with assurances I gave
them when they came over.

00:42:39.650 --> 00:42:44.320
It is inconceivable there is
something better, if possible,

00:42:44.320 --> 00:42:48.800
that a man can give than his life,
and that is his living spirit

00:42:48.800 --> 00:42:51.340
to a service that is not easy.

00:42:51.340 --> 00:42:56.370
To resist counsels that are hard to
resist, to stand against purposes

00:42:56.370 --> 00:43:02.580
that are difficult to stand
against, and to say, 'Here stand I,

00:43:02.580 --> 00:43:08.170
consecrated in spirit to the
men who were once my comrades

00:43:08.170 --> 00:43:13.900
who are not gone and who have
left me under internal bands

00:43:13.900 --> 00:43:22.560 position:56%
of fidelity.'" I often wish every
president had to read that paragraph

00:43:22.560 --> 00:43:28.680
of that speech before he
sends any man or woman abroad.

00:43:28.680 --> 00:43:35.010
So, we live in a world and
especially a country whose economy,

00:43:35.010 --> 00:43:41.490
whose entire foreign policy,
you see, our identity was forged

00:43:41.490 --> 00:43:44.460
by this war, by World War I.

00:43:44.460 --> 00:43:47.290
And I think taking a
cue from Woodrow Wilson,

00:43:47.290 --> 00:43:51.780 position:56%
it behooves us never to forget that.

00:43:51.780 --> 00:43:53.580
Thank you very much.
