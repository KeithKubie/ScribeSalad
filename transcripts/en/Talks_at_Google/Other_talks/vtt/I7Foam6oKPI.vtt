JORDAN THIBODEAU:
Welcome, everyone.

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:06.120
I'd like to introduce you
to Tim Ferriss, author

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.100
of "The 4-Hour Workweek,"
"Body," and "Chef,"

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:11.860
hosts "The Tim Ferriss
Show," the number one rated

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:15.240
business podcast on iTunes,
and a serial investor.

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:16.950
I'm your host, Jordan Thibodeau.

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:20.936
So without further ado, let's
give Tim a nice welcome.

00:00:20.936 --> 00:00:23.812
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:33.950
So Tim, what has been one of the
most important stoic teachings?

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:36.450
TIM FERRISS: So
stoic philosophy is

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.500
in essence the
operating system that I

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.290
use for making better
decisions, or try to use.

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:46.240
It's very old-- 2,000-plus
years old in various iterations.

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:51.030
And I would say that you
can start in many places,

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.860
whether it's Marcus Aurelius'
"Meditations," or the "Moral

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:58.556
Letters to Lucilius,"
the letters of Seneca.

00:00:58.556 --> 00:01:00.180
Cato is particularly
interesting to me.

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.030
And one of the lessons that
I try to implement in my life

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.580
comes from Cato.

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.120
Cato was considered by
many the perfect stoic.

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:09.330
I'm sure he was not
perfect, as none of us are.

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.500
But he would regularly,
for instance,

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:16.880
wear mismatched clothing
in the high-profile arenas

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.280
where that was frowned
upon so that he could train

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.760
himself to be ashamed
only of the things

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:23.550
worth being ashamed of.

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:25.660
So he would practice
doing things

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:31.150
that would earn him the scorn,
superficial scorn, of others.

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:36.880
And the form that that can
take can be very, very simple.

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.310
And you can do in
very small ways.

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.140
But I have what I would call,
for instance-- and this is

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.223
a ridiculous example, but
that's the whole point--

00:01:42.223 --> 00:01:46.130
I have my party pants, which
are these ridiculous pants that

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:48.190
look straight out
of "Austin Powers."

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:51.450
And I will occasionally
wear those not to the extent

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.940
that I would offend some
guest-- like dinner host

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:56.247
in some-- I don't
want to make enemies.

00:01:56.247 --> 00:01:57.080
That's not the goal.

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:58.320
But I'll wear it
in a place where

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.445
I know that I'm going to
get these sideways glances

00:02:00.445 --> 00:02:03.400
from everyone to try
to inoculate myself

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.960
against that type of
superficial attachment

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.789
to what others think.

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.640
For a while, recently,
I was wearing

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:16.410
what I could best describe as
like a creepy porn 'stache.

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:21.520
It was a very ill-advised
half-grown mustache

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.040
that looked terrible.

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.040
It really did look-- it was
like "Chester the Molester."

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.000
It was terrible.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.360
And I wore that around for
a good week and a half.

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.150
And every time I would put
up a photograph on Instagram

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.930
or wherever it was, they'd be
like please, for god's sake,

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.130
take that thing off your face.

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:40.550
And it was just an exercise.

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:42.006
It was yet another exercise.

00:02:42.006 --> 00:02:43.880
And there are many
different ways to do this.

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.990
But I think that that would
be one that comes to mind--

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:50.690
is regularly practicing things
that you feel embarrassed

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:54.380
by, but shouldn't-- that have
no grander importance whatsoever

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:59.000
so that when you train
yourself to not be embarrassed

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.190
by the small things, then
when it comes time to make big

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.960
decisions, stand up
for something larger,

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:07.590
you will have the
training that you need.

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.980
And this is not
necessarily stoic.

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:11.625
But I think it's Archilochus.

00:03:11.625 --> 00:03:15.550
I'm not brushed up on my
ancient pronunciation.

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:18.290
But this is military.

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:19.450
This is a military context.

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:22.530
But it was we do not rise
to the level of our hopes.

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.330
We fall to the level
of our training.

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:29.030
So what I like about stoicism
is that it offers practical ways

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.920
of practicing this.

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.905
The second would be practicing
your worst-case scenario.

00:03:32.905 --> 00:03:33.780
This is very similar.

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.790
So [INAUDIBLE] a
larger meta example.

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:40.450
Seneca-- I think it's "On
Fasting and Festivals" or "On

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:41.610
Festivals and Fasting."

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:43.420
I think it's Letter
13, actually,

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:45.050
in the "Moral
Letters to Lucilius,"

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:46.450
which I reread all the time.

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:47.580
Clearly, you can tell.

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:50.550
And to set aside a
certain number of days,

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:52.870
say, each month, which
I do, during which

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:55.670
you will be satisfied with the
cheapest and scantest affair,

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:59.280
wear the roughest of clothing,
et cetera, asking yourself

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.160
all the while is this the
condition that I so feared?

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.310
So practicing poverty,
which would then

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:06.390
empower you to make
decisions because you

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:08.910
know the worst-case
scenario isn't that bad.

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:12.060
And for that reason, among
other reasons we can get into,

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.440
I do one three-day
fast every month.

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:18.269
I do one seven- to 10-day fast
every one to two quarters.

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:20.579
And there are other things
that I do on top of that.

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:22.800
But those are a few
that come to mind.

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:23.970
JORDAN THIBODEAU: Excellent.

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:26.652
In your podcast, you've
talked about the monkey brain.

00:04:26.652 --> 00:04:27.860
Can you explain what that is?

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:28.610
TIM FERRISS: Yeah.

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:31.340
The monkey brain or monkey mind
is, I think, inside all of us

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:32.140
in some capacity.

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:36.794
It's this incessant internal
dialogue, or maybe not

00:04:36.794 --> 00:04:37.460
even a dialogue.

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:40.320
Maybe it's just some stern
or irritating roommate

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:42.650
that you have in your head.

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:46.070
And we can all think back
to, say, elementary school.

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:48.180
I remember there was
this kid in my class.

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:49.330
He was always misbehaving.

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:51.080
And I remember at
one point, he got up.

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:52.670
It was like third grade.

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:55.240
And the teacher suddenly froze.

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:56.120
And we turned around.

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:58.310
And he had a fork over his head.

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:00.340
And he said I am the
master of the universe.

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:02.570
And he stabbed an
electrical outlet

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:04.650
and just got, like,
blown backwards.

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:07.270
And then there was this
kid who would walk over

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:10.610
and he would always-- he
would build a building out

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:12.859
of construction blocks.

00:05:12.859 --> 00:05:15.400
And then inevitably, it would
fall over when it got too tall.

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:17.740
And then he'd just
lay down and cry.

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:19.726
And I think that
as we get older,

00:05:19.726 --> 00:05:21.600
we learn to not do those
things because you'd

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:23.750
be put in a straitjacket.

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:25.540
But as a result,
they're internalized.

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:28.210
So all day, we're walking
around with some version

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:30.140
or a combination of
all of those things.

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:32.900
And the context in which
I probably brought it up,

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:35.360
the monkey mind,
was as it relates

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:37.160
to my morning journaling.

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:39.110
So I do regularly journal.

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:41.870
Sometimes I do what would
be considered morning pages.

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:44.370
Other times, I use something
called the Five Minute Journal,

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:46.300
which we could talk about.

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:50.870
But the goal is not
to write, per se.

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:52.360
I'm not doing it
for someone else.

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:55.530
I am simply capturing
my monkey mind.

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:59.530
It's litany of complaints
or insecurities on paper

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:02.630
so that it's not caught on
repeat for the rest of the day.

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:08.020
I'm simply giving it a
two-dimensional prison

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:12.370
or playpen so that I can
then move on with my day

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:16.584
and hit mute at least for
a brief period of time

00:06:16.584 --> 00:06:17.250
on those things.

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:23.720
But I think that if you want
to be less reactive, to be

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:27.090
the author of your own life
or business career, whatever

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:30.590
it might be, you have to
be able to do deep work

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:33.779
and think long-term
and rationally.

00:06:33.779 --> 00:06:35.320
And for all of those
things, you need

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:37.153
to get very good at
identifying where you're

00:06:37.153 --> 00:06:43.000
being overly reactive to
thoughts, to external factors

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.150
outside of your control,
whatever it might be.

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:47.880
JORDAN THIBODEAU: That ties
back to the Five Minute Journal.

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:48.755
TIM FERRISS: It does.

00:06:48.755 --> 00:06:50.297
The Five Minute
Journal is-- it's

00:06:50.297 --> 00:06:51.880
a journal that was
created by a reader

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:52.970
of "The 4-Hour
Workweek," actually,

00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:54.540
for those who have
read the book.

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:57.590
It was their muse--
so one of their cash

00:06:57.590 --> 00:07:01.920
flow-focused businesses in the
context of lifestyle design.

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:05.650
But you take 2 and 1/2
minutes or so in the morning

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:06.690
and then again at night.

00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:09.280
And so one is effectively a
focusing and planning exercise.

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:10.840
There's also a
gratitude component,

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:14.010
which I think is very
critical for those of us who

00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:17.240
are driven Type A achievers.

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:20.952
It's very easy to constantly
be focused on the future

00:07:20.952 --> 00:07:22.410
and just to hit
pause for a second.

00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:24.110
I've heard someone
say that depression

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:26.540
is an obsession with
the past and anxieties,

00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:28.050
and an obsession
with the future.

00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:30.980
Well, if you look
at achievers, they

00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:32.725
tend to be very future-focused.

00:07:32.725 --> 00:07:34.600
And as soon as they hit
a goal, they're like,

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:37.520
don't have time to
celebrate this small win.

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:40.620
This isn't good enough-- bigger,
bigger, better, et cetera.

00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:45.380
And that is a pattern that can
be very self-destructive even

00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:48.420
if you rack up a lot of
wins at the same time.

00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:50.630
So the gratitude component
is extremely critical.

00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:52.960
That takes but 2 and
1/2 minutes each day.

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:57.260
And it also helps to
identify your focal points

00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:02.030
or your priorities so that
when inevitably that 10% that's

00:08:02.030 --> 00:08:05.390
left of the monkey mind pops
up to dance in front of you

00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:07.770
and distract you
from your objectives

00:08:07.770 --> 00:08:10.111
you set out for the day,
you can return to that.

00:08:10.111 --> 00:08:11.610
And then at the end
of the day, it's

00:08:11.610 --> 00:08:13.670
basically a performance review.

00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:19.030
And I find it incredibly helpful
and a lot of ROI for the time

00:08:19.030 --> 00:08:20.010
invested.

00:08:20.010 --> 00:08:21.176
JORDAN THIBODEAU: Excellent.

00:08:21.176 --> 00:08:23.996
So it seems like it gives you
a degree of mental clarity.

00:08:23.996 --> 00:08:25.120
TIM FERRISS: Yeah, it does.

00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:27.080
And I think that
what separates--

00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:28.540
if I think about
my podcast, I've

00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:31.840
interviewed 100 to 150
world-class performers

00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:34.419
across every possible
demand imaginable-- sports,

00:08:34.419 --> 00:08:38.900
entertainment,
politics, art, chess,

00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:42.380
it just goes on and on-- that
the difference between somebody

00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:46.010
who's good, like
let's just call it

00:08:46.010 --> 00:08:48.400
the top quartile
of the population

00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:50.820
in their chosen
field, and the top 1%,

00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:53.940
it's the degree
to which they can

00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:56.879
focus to determine their
goals and maintain that focus.

00:08:56.879 --> 00:08:57.920
JORDAN THIBODEAU: Gotcha.

00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:01.554
TIM FERRISS: It's one of the
largest distinguishing factors.

00:09:01.554 --> 00:09:02.970
JORDAN THIBODEAU:
Now, with people

00:09:02.970 --> 00:09:07.700
who've achieved such success in
their careers or in athletics

00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:14.010
or whatever, what can people do
to maintain their humbleness?

00:09:14.010 --> 00:09:17.320
TIM FERRISS: Humility,
I think, is not

00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:22.750
too tough to maintain if you
create the proper environments.

00:09:22.750 --> 00:09:29.281
And I'm not a huge fan of
self-control or willpower.

00:09:29.281 --> 00:09:30.530
I think it's really overrated.

00:09:30.530 --> 00:09:33.390
It's like, oh, well, fat people
are fat because they just

00:09:33.390 --> 00:09:34.382
lack the willpower.

00:09:34.382 --> 00:09:35.770
It's like, no.

00:09:35.770 --> 00:09:40.317
That's a stupid, lazy answer,
or just a shite observation.

00:09:40.317 --> 00:09:41.900
If you look at
behavior modifications,

00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:42.890
they just have
lack of incentives.

00:09:42.890 --> 00:09:44.570
They have lack of
social accountability.

00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:47.290
Maybe they don't have the
information that they need.

00:09:47.290 --> 00:09:50.702
And you can create environments
in which you can train.

00:09:50.702 --> 00:09:52.910
And I come back to this over
and over and over again.

00:09:52.910 --> 00:09:58.320
But there are few things I
think that are very helpful.

00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:02.090
One is memento
mori, so remembering

00:10:02.090 --> 00:10:04.570
that you're going
to die, and putting

00:10:04.570 --> 00:10:06.880
that-- it's also very stoic.

00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:09.410
I'm somewhat obsessed about
death, even to a degree

00:10:09.410 --> 00:10:10.160
that I find weird.

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:15.300
But memento mori-- so
constantly revisiting death

00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:18.650
and realizing it forces
you to put your life

00:10:18.650 --> 00:10:22.840
in a broader context of
civilization and the world.

00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:26.500
And I think that in and of
itself is very corrective.

00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:28.420
And how do you
practice or develop

00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:29.840
that sense of memento mori?

00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:31.214
I have a quote on
my refrigerator

00:10:31.214 --> 00:10:32.620
that's from Marcus Aurelius.

00:10:32.620 --> 00:10:36.314
And "Meditations," by the way,
is effectively a war journal.

00:10:36.314 --> 00:10:38.480
While Marcus Aurelius, who
was the most powerful man

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:41.550
on the planet at the
time-- emperor of Rome--

00:10:41.550 --> 00:10:43.170
was on a military campaign.

00:10:43.170 --> 00:10:47.144
And he would write these entries
to do exactly this-- to remind

00:10:47.144 --> 00:10:49.310
himself that he was just a
man, he was going to die,

00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:50.185
it would all be dust.

00:10:50.185 --> 00:10:53.750
And it sounds depressing
until you realize the clarity

00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:59.500
and lack of waste that comes
from constantly repeating

00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:00.770
those types of things.

00:11:00.770 --> 00:11:03.540
Then you have the memento
homo-- probably getting

00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:04.460
the pronunciation off.

00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:08.220
But that is remembering that
you are just a man or a person.

00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:13.194
So we don't have-- those in
this room probably are not

00:11:13.194 --> 00:11:14.860
going to commission,
like Julius Caesar,

00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:16.860
someone to hold a laurel
wreath over your head

00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:19.630
while you're doing a procession
like the Roman triumph

00:11:19.630 --> 00:11:22.790
to say you're just a man, you're
just a man, you're not a god.

00:11:22.790 --> 00:11:27.232
But the way that you can
very easily humble yourself

00:11:27.232 --> 00:11:28.940
is to always try to
be the weakest person

00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:31.709
in the room in something.

00:11:31.709 --> 00:11:33.500
Every day, you should
be the weakest person

00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:37.170
in the room at some point,
whether that is in a meeting,

00:11:37.170 --> 00:11:40.970
whether that is in a sport,
whether that is in a gym,

00:11:40.970 --> 00:11:42.910
whether that is
in a chess match.

00:11:42.910 --> 00:11:43.710
It doesn't matter.

00:11:43.710 --> 00:11:46.280
But I always try to be the
weakest person in the room.

00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:51.682
And I remember when I was 15,
I had my first time overseas

00:11:51.682 --> 00:11:52.640
for an extended period.

00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:53.990
I was in Japan for a year.

00:11:53.990 --> 00:11:57.500
And I ended up
being a judo player.

00:11:57.500 --> 00:11:59.150
I was competing in judo.

00:11:59.150 --> 00:12:01.670
And the high school
that I went to

00:12:01.670 --> 00:12:03.190
was not particularly
strong in judo.

00:12:03.190 --> 00:12:05.210
But I was the big fish
in the little pond.

00:12:05.210 --> 00:12:07.000
And I got very high and mighty.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.160
I thought I was
just the cat's meow.

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:12.140
And I wasn't too overt about it.

00:12:12.140 --> 00:12:15.086
But I was very sort of satisfied
with how well I was doing.

00:12:15.086 --> 00:12:16.460
Went to my first
tournament and I

00:12:16.460 --> 00:12:19.620
got demolished in seven
seconds by this guy who weighed

00:12:19.620 --> 00:12:21.010
40 pounds less than I did.

00:12:21.010 --> 00:12:22.830
Like Ippon Gachi-- that was it.

00:12:22.830 --> 00:12:23.349
I was done.

00:12:23.349 --> 00:12:23.890
And I got up.

00:12:23.890 --> 00:12:24.400
I'm like, I'm fine.

00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:26.050
They're like no,
you're the loser.

00:12:26.050 --> 00:12:26.920
You're done.

00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:28.505
You are done.

00:12:28.505 --> 00:12:31.340
And I was so demoralized.

00:12:31.340 --> 00:12:33.620
And I was the only white
guy in the tournament.

00:12:33.620 --> 00:12:37.045
And it was kind of-- so
there were a lot of people

00:12:37.045 --> 00:12:39.420
just hoping that they would
be able to kind of, like, was

00:12:39.420 --> 00:12:40.690
a finger and laugh.

00:12:40.690 --> 00:12:41.900
And we love Japan.

00:12:41.900 --> 00:12:44.740
But it's like I get it--
a very homogeneous place.

00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:49.270
So I ended up going after that
to a cram school for judo,

00:12:49.270 --> 00:12:51.940
like a juku-- they have it for
all sorts of things-- at night.

00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:56.591
And I want to Tokai
University's judo cram schools.

00:12:56.591 --> 00:12:59.090
So Tokai University produces
gold medalists in the Olympics.

00:12:59.090 --> 00:13:00.360
They're really, really tough.

00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:00.901
So I went in.

00:13:00.901 --> 00:13:02.570
And I was 15 at the time.

00:13:02.570 --> 00:13:07.280
And I got just annihilated
by 12-year-olds-- talk

00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:08.570
about embarrassing.

00:13:08.570 --> 00:13:10.820
If you can try to flash back
to high school and you're

00:13:10.820 --> 00:13:12.340
like [INTENTIONALLY MUMBLES].

00:13:12.340 --> 00:13:14.510
And you're like a
sophomore in high school

00:13:14.510 --> 00:13:17.340
getting killed by sixth
graders, seventh graders.

00:13:17.340 --> 00:13:19.450
It's so embarrassing,
including women.

00:13:19.450 --> 00:13:21.530
I was getting torn to pieces.

00:13:21.530 --> 00:13:23.590
And I got trashed for
three or four months.

00:13:23.590 --> 00:13:26.359
And I was like, wow,
I don't feel like I'm

00:13:26.359 --> 00:13:27.400
making a lot of progress.

00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:29.670
My endurance is getting
a little bit better.

00:13:29.670 --> 00:13:32.440
And went to a tournament
that had the same competitors

00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:34.830
as the previous term and just
walked through everybody,

00:13:34.830 --> 00:13:39.295
just steamrolled because I
had a better cohort group.

00:13:39.295 --> 00:13:42.210
I was the weakest in the room.

00:13:42.210 --> 00:13:44.890
As long as you're trending
in the right direction,

00:13:44.890 --> 00:13:46.580
it doesn't matter
if you're losing.

00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:49.240
And so that would
be one approach.

00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:52.060
Just every day, schedule it.

00:13:52.060 --> 00:13:52.580
Plan it.

00:13:52.580 --> 00:13:56.080
Be the weakest person in
the room in some capacity.

00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:57.830
JORDAN THIBODEAU: You
have multiple people

00:13:57.830 --> 00:14:00.010
trying to reach out to
you and contact you.

00:14:00.010 --> 00:14:02.955
How do you manage
all those requests?

00:14:02.955 --> 00:14:04.580
TIM FERRISS: I suppose
the short answer

00:14:04.580 --> 00:14:08.220
is I don't manage
all those requests.

00:14:08.220 --> 00:14:12.010
The irony of "The 4-Hour
Workweek," among many others,

00:14:12.010 --> 00:14:15.860
is that my systems have to be
100 times better now than they

00:14:15.860 --> 00:14:18.480
were when the book came
out because if you look

00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:21.280
at my assistants and the
various embed channels

00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:26.420
that we have or try to
avoid, but nonetheless have,

00:14:26.420 --> 00:14:30.840
it's 1,500 to 2,000 direct
messages of some type every day

00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:32.590
that hit me and my team.

00:14:32.590 --> 00:14:36.400
That's excluding all the tweets,
Facebook mentions, Google+,

00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:36.940
et cetera.

00:14:36.940 --> 00:14:39.440
It's ignoring all of that.

00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:45.170
So the way that I try to
think about handling that

00:14:45.170 --> 00:14:49.500
is having rules set in advance.

00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:53.740
So for instance, if we were
to take a corporate or startup

00:14:53.740 --> 00:14:56.590
analogy, you don't
want to decide

00:14:56.590 --> 00:14:59.900
how to respond to a
crisis when a crisis hits.

00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:01.980
If you think you're
going to have a disaster,

00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:04.310
you want to role-play it out
and say, all right, if a,

00:15:04.310 --> 00:15:06.680
then b, c, or d.

00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:09.260
If x, then y and z.

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:12.240
And you have a plan in place
so that-- and this all ties

00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:16.740
back together-- if disaster
strikes, you are not reactive.

00:15:16.740 --> 00:15:20.850
You don't make a
impulsive decision

00:15:20.850 --> 00:15:24.527
that could destroy a lot of
what you've worked to achieve,

00:15:24.527 --> 00:15:25.610
including your reputation.

00:15:25.610 --> 00:15:29.390
So with email, I have
very particular rules.

00:15:29.390 --> 00:15:31.330
And I will block
out periods of time.

00:15:31.330 --> 00:15:33.240
For instance, I'm
going to take July--

00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:35.770
and I did this about
two years ago in Bali.

00:15:35.770 --> 00:15:38.120
There's actually a good piece
in "Inc" magazine called

00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:41.540
"The 4-Hour Reality
Check" that's

00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:42.870
not a bad read about this.

00:15:42.870 --> 00:15:46.980
But I'm blocking out July to
focus on writing and deep work

00:15:46.980 --> 00:15:48.530
in that capacity.

00:15:48.530 --> 00:15:51.380
So I have to set up systems
and rules in advance

00:15:51.380 --> 00:15:54.916
so that I don't have to be on
email or calendar or phone,

00:15:54.916 --> 00:15:56.790
which is what I did for
a month in Indonesia.

00:15:56.790 --> 00:15:58.610
I'm going to do
this time overseas.

00:15:58.610 --> 00:16:03.590
And so the important thing
is deciding on your policies.

00:16:03.590 --> 00:16:05.980
And I've realized for
myself that I do moderation

00:16:05.980 --> 00:16:10.250
very poorly, whether it's
caffeine, booze-- if I'm on,

00:16:10.250 --> 00:16:11.700
I am on.

00:16:11.700 --> 00:16:14.820
And if I am off, I am off.

00:16:14.820 --> 00:16:17.460
So that is why I decided
to take a startup

00:16:17.460 --> 00:16:19.990
vacation-- effectively
retirement--

00:16:19.990 --> 00:16:21.530
as of about nine months ago.

00:16:21.530 --> 00:16:23.870
I realized-- this is
just one example--

00:16:23.870 --> 00:16:27.600
I was drowning in email intros
to founders and cold emails

00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:29.600
and pitches and this,
that, and the other thing.

00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:33.460
Whether I do 100 deals
a year, 10 deals a year,

00:16:33.460 --> 00:16:37.680
one deal a year, if I
have to filter and look

00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:40.330
at all of the inbound
to make decisions,

00:16:40.330 --> 00:16:43.690
it's almost the exact
same amount of work.

00:16:43.690 --> 00:16:45.000
Does that make sense?

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:50.720
So trying to pare
back in moderation--

00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:51.730
it's a fool's errand.

00:16:51.730 --> 00:16:53.646
You just end up doing
the same amount of work.

00:16:53.646 --> 00:16:56.420
So I will decide am I doing
speaking engagements or not,

00:16:56.420 --> 00:16:57.290
period?

00:16:57.290 --> 00:17:01.580
Am I doing, say,
interviews or not, period?

00:17:01.580 --> 00:17:04.064
Am I writing for any other
sites whatsoever, because I get

00:17:04.064 --> 00:17:05.480
hit by people who
want me to write

00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:07.104
for this and this
new startup, to write

00:17:07.104 --> 00:17:08.880
for such and such
established media that's

00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:10.891
trying to branch into whatever.

00:17:10.891 --> 00:17:11.390
No.

00:17:11.390 --> 00:17:13.490
The answer for that
is absolutely not

00:17:13.490 --> 00:17:15.270
because I'm focusing
on my own writing.

00:17:15.270 --> 00:17:18.099
And the Five Minute
Journal-- all these things

00:17:18.099 --> 00:17:22.790
help to allow you to
practice that focus.

00:17:22.790 --> 00:17:24.280
And then there are tools.

00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:27.829
So there's a very small subset--
let's just call it 1% to 2%--

00:17:27.829 --> 00:17:30.810
that get me closer to sort
of the mountain that I see

00:17:30.810 --> 00:17:33.670
in the distance which represents
the goals I've already set

00:17:33.670 --> 00:17:34.170
for myself.

00:17:34.170 --> 00:17:35.040
And I'll have metrics.

00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:37.123
I'll have KPIs where I
keep performance indicators

00:17:37.123 --> 00:17:39.330
for these things,
like podcast growth.

00:17:39.330 --> 00:17:43.490
And a great commencement
speech by Neil Gaiman everybody

00:17:43.490 --> 00:17:45.970
should check out called "Make
Good Art"-- it's fantastic.

00:17:45.970 --> 00:17:48.270
But he talks a lot about this.

00:17:48.270 --> 00:17:52.120
And then the question is what
are the tools or policies,

00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:54.769
tactics, that help with
managing that subset that I

00:17:54.769 --> 00:17:55.560
am going to tackle?

00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:59.970
I use tools like
ScheduleOnce for scheduling--

00:17:59.970 --> 00:18:02.980
allows other people
to find times

00:18:02.980 --> 00:18:05.422
and to avoid the back and forth.

00:18:05.422 --> 00:18:07.130
If you guys want to
see something that'll

00:18:07.130 --> 00:18:10.080
be painfully humorous,
you can check out

00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:14.070
I think it's "Let's Get Drinks"
in I believe "The New Yorker."

00:18:14.070 --> 00:18:15.340
Somebody could look that up.

00:18:15.340 --> 00:18:17.030
You'll be like, that is my life.

00:18:17.030 --> 00:18:19.285
I remember there
was a tweet that I

00:18:19.285 --> 00:18:23.080
saw recently which was--
I'm paraphrasing-- adulthood

00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:28.180
is saying sorry for the late
reply until one of you dies.

00:18:28.180 --> 00:18:31.930
It's like that is a
sad state of affairs.

00:18:31.930 --> 00:18:33.150
So I'll use ScheduleOnce.

00:18:33.150 --> 00:18:35.000
I'll use a tool
called Boomerang,

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:39.010
which allows me to not
just automate followup

00:18:39.010 --> 00:18:41.030
reminders if I don't
hear back from someone,

00:18:41.030 --> 00:18:43.360
but to set parameters,
and secondly-- this

00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:47.670
is very underused as a
feature-- to send in the future.

00:18:47.670 --> 00:18:51.970
So the way you train
someone, just like training

00:18:51.970 --> 00:18:54.575
a dog or a manatee
or anything else,

00:18:54.575 --> 00:18:56.950
the same stuff-- there's a
great book called "Don't Shoot

00:18:56.950 --> 00:18:59.450
the Dog" that you should all
read about for training humans,

00:18:59.450 --> 00:19:07.376
also-- is you can extend the
time between which you respond

00:19:07.376 --> 00:19:08.500
to certain types of people.

00:19:08.500 --> 00:19:11.640
And it just teaches them
that you are not on IM.

00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:14.334
Email is not messenger for you.

00:19:14.334 --> 00:19:16.000
So sending in the
future-- very helpful.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:19.060
Processing email-- I
use Gmail offline a lot.

00:19:19.060 --> 00:19:22.010
So I'll process email,
batch process email offline,

00:19:22.010 --> 00:19:24.450
so that I don't have the
psychological trauma of feeling

00:19:24.450 --> 00:19:26.741
like I'm doing whack-a-mole
where I send off two emails

00:19:26.741 --> 00:19:29.420
and I get five back and I'm just
like, I can't, I'm drowning,

00:19:29.420 --> 00:19:30.150
I can't do this.

00:19:30.150 --> 00:19:32.780
And then you're like I should
go watch "Game of Thrones"

00:19:32.780 --> 00:19:34.850
or whatever you use
to procrastinate.

00:19:34.850 --> 00:19:38.570
To avoid that, batch processing
offline-- hugely valuable.

00:19:38.570 --> 00:19:41.430
And there are other
things that I do.

00:19:41.430 --> 00:19:46.000
I'll give one more, which
is if you send an email,

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.100
try to think of
if-then scenarios.

00:19:48.100 --> 00:19:51.020
So the engineers in
the room will probably

00:19:51.020 --> 00:19:53.350
do this naturally--
is thinking in terms

00:19:53.350 --> 00:19:54.660
of scripts or algorithms.

00:19:54.660 --> 00:19:57.150
But if you send an
email-- you're like, hey,

00:19:57.150 --> 00:19:59.340
can you meet up next
week, and that's

00:19:59.340 --> 00:20:02.170
the end of the email,
that's a bad email.

00:20:02.170 --> 00:20:04.800
So can you meet up next week?

00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:06.590
I suggest this
time or this time.

00:20:06.590 --> 00:20:09.050
This is my first choice.

00:20:09.050 --> 00:20:11.000
If you can't do
those times, please

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:13.310
suggest two or three
times in this time frame

00:20:13.310 --> 00:20:14.450
that works for you.

00:20:14.450 --> 00:20:16.920
Let's set it for 30 minutes--
being really specific.

00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:19.550
It takes an extra 30
seconds on the front end

00:20:19.550 --> 00:20:22.750
and it will save you 20
exchanges on the back end.

00:20:22.750 --> 00:20:26.261
So just always thinking
is there an if-then line

00:20:26.261 --> 00:20:28.010
that I should put in
this email before you

00:20:28.010 --> 00:20:30.160
hit Send saves a lot of time.

00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:32.850
But I try to move as much
as possible off of email

00:20:32.850 --> 00:20:37.460
to things like Slack, Dropbox,
et cetera, whenever possible.

00:20:37.460 --> 00:20:40.590
It was designed for emergency
military communication,

00:20:40.590 --> 00:20:42.440
not for what we use
it for currently.

00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:43.962
JORDAN THIBODEAU: Right, right.

00:20:43.962 --> 00:20:45.420
So most of us here
in this audience

00:20:45.420 --> 00:20:47.700
have listened to your podcast.

00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:49.189
And it's been wildly successful.

00:20:49.189 --> 00:20:51.355
What do you think drives
the success of the podcast?

00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:57.380
TIM FERRISS: I think the
podcast is successful

00:20:57.380 --> 00:21:02.370
because I knew I had a
guaranteed audience of one.

00:21:02.370 --> 00:21:05.080
And that means I was
scratching my own itch.

00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:10.270
In the case of whenever I try to
design something for a market,

00:21:10.270 --> 00:21:11.400
it fails.

00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:14.450
Whenever I just do something
that I couldn't find

00:21:14.450 --> 00:21:16.620
for myself, then it does fine.

00:21:16.620 --> 00:21:17.770
It seems to be the trend.

00:21:17.770 --> 00:21:19.330
So I'm scratching my own itch.

00:21:19.330 --> 00:21:26.310
And what I was missing was
the long-form fly on the wall

00:21:26.310 --> 00:21:31.860
conversation, but also the
tactics and the really detailed

00:21:31.860 --> 00:21:34.000
nitty-gritty how-to stuff.

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.186
And all the books
came about this way.

00:21:36.186 --> 00:21:38.310
I was looking for something,
looking for something,

00:21:38.310 --> 00:21:39.226
looking for something.

00:21:39.226 --> 00:21:41.620
And I was just like, fuck,
I'll just write it myself.

00:21:41.620 --> 00:21:42.780
This is too annoying
because I would

00:21:42.780 --> 00:21:43.905
gather all these resources.

00:21:43.905 --> 00:21:46.900
I'd be like, OK, I will
at least compile this.

00:21:46.900 --> 00:21:48.480
And in the case
of the podcast, I

00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:52.240
wanted to try to spot the
patterns in all these experts.

00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:55.640
And I was already doing this
type of prep work for the books

00:21:55.640 --> 00:21:56.890
by ferreting these people out.

00:21:56.890 --> 00:22:01.450
And it just so
happens that I would

00:22:01.450 --> 00:22:04.220
have these dinners or
drinks with folks who

00:22:04.220 --> 00:22:05.535
are the best at what they do.

00:22:05.535 --> 00:22:07.660
And I would think afterwards--
usually two or three

00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:11.090
glasses of wine in-- be
like, man, this is so good.

00:22:11.090 --> 00:22:13.450
I wish I could just share this.

00:22:13.450 --> 00:22:15.040
Why don't I just record this?

00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:20.000
And then-- if any of you heard
the first episode-- so sloppy

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:22.250
with Kevin Rose because
I was so nervous even

00:22:22.250 --> 00:22:25.470
though he was a close friend--
still is a close friend.

00:22:25.470 --> 00:22:28.085
And he was just busting
my balls the whole time

00:22:28.085 --> 00:22:30.850
because that's what close
guy friends do to each other.

00:22:30.850 --> 00:22:33.380
And so I just was
drinking way too much.

00:22:33.380 --> 00:22:35.329
And I remember we recorded
the first podcast.

00:22:35.329 --> 00:22:36.620
And I'd committed to doing six.

00:22:36.620 --> 00:22:37.370
This is important.

00:22:37.370 --> 00:22:38.500
I can mention why.

00:22:38.500 --> 00:22:41.660
But I was skipping through
the audio just checking

00:22:41.660 --> 00:22:42.430
on the quality.

00:22:42.430 --> 00:22:45.520
And it's like two hours long,
two and a half hours long.

00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:50.936
And about an hour in, I was so
anxious, for whatever reason.

00:22:50.936 --> 00:22:53.190
And I was like, well, Kevin,
I want to be respectful

00:22:53.190 --> 00:22:55.340
of your time, da-da-da-da-da-da.

00:22:55.340 --> 00:22:57.231
And then I was like,
all right, whatever.

00:22:57.231 --> 00:22:57.730
Click.

00:22:57.730 --> 00:23:00.425
Forward like an hour, and the
same exact phrase came up.

00:23:00.425 --> 00:23:01.800
And it was like,
(SLURRING) well,

00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:03.982
Kevin, I just want to be
respectful of your time.

00:23:03.982 --> 00:23:06.474
And I was like, oh my
god, this is terrible.

00:23:06.474 --> 00:23:07.820
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:07.820 --> 00:23:11.155
And I had this
lip-smacking tick.

00:23:11.155 --> 00:23:14.740
And all this stuff was
like, the shame, the shame.

00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:17.750
And I committed to six
because if you only do one,

00:23:17.750 --> 00:23:19.880
you're going to quit,
or most people will.

00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:21.590
So you commit to six.

00:23:21.590 --> 00:23:25.122
And the question I asked
myself because the success--

00:23:25.122 --> 00:23:26.580
you asked what
makes it successful.

00:23:26.580 --> 00:23:29.206
There are actually a bunch
of questions baked into that.

00:23:29.206 --> 00:23:31.080
There's what makes the
product something that

00:23:31.080 --> 00:23:32.750
could be successful?

00:23:32.750 --> 00:23:35.030
There's what makes it
something that spreads?

00:23:35.030 --> 00:23:37.450
But there's also why
it survived, which

00:23:37.450 --> 00:23:39.110
is maybe the better question.

00:23:39.110 --> 00:23:41.593
If I had tried to do
something fancier,

00:23:41.593 --> 00:23:43.540
like fill in the
blank-- something that

00:23:43.540 --> 00:23:47.280
is produced really well,
like "Freakonomics Radio,"

00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:49.320
I don't have the experience
and the resources.

00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:51.749
I would have become overwhelmed
and I would have quit.

00:23:51.749 --> 00:23:53.540
So rule number one is
if you want something

00:23:53.540 --> 00:23:57.220
to be successful, you can't
quit after two episodes.

00:23:57.220 --> 00:23:58.930
You actually have
to get to a point

00:23:58.930 --> 00:24:01.240
where your learning
curve hockey sticks.

00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:06.290
And I believe for my format,
for podcasts in general,

00:24:06.290 --> 00:24:08.430
that's at least six episodes.

00:24:08.430 --> 00:24:12.650
And so the questions
that I think

00:24:12.650 --> 00:24:15.250
have allowed it
to succeed for me

00:24:15.250 --> 00:24:18.560
and for me to feel
successful doing it

00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:21.540
because I enjoy it is number
one, how do I keep this fun?

00:24:21.540 --> 00:24:24.500
Number two, what would it
look like if it were simple?

00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:27.930
I ask myself that question
more and more all the time now.

00:24:27.930 --> 00:24:29.680
What would this
look like if it were

00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:32.050
dead simple, stupid simple?

00:24:32.050 --> 00:24:34.030
OK, Ferriss, I know
you like feature creep.

00:24:34.030 --> 00:24:35.970
I know you love
writing 700-page books.

00:24:35.970 --> 00:24:38.636
But let's hold back
on that for a second.

00:24:38.636 --> 00:24:40.385
What would this look
like if it were easy?

00:24:40.385 --> 00:24:43.684
And try that first.

00:24:43.684 --> 00:24:45.100
So I think those
are a few things.

00:24:45.100 --> 00:24:48.160
But it's very, very,
very, very tactic-rich--

00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:50.379
routines, habits, what
is the book that you've

00:24:50.379 --> 00:24:52.670
gifted the most to other
people, what does the first 60

00:24:52.670 --> 00:24:55.920
minutes of your day look like--
specifically, exact times.

00:24:55.920 --> 00:24:56.660
You have coffee?

00:24:56.660 --> 00:24:57.880
How do you make your coffee?

00:24:57.880 --> 00:24:58.838
What brand do you like?

00:24:58.838 --> 00:24:59.390
Why?

00:24:59.390 --> 00:25:06.900
And just I try and harness that
OCD in a way that is helpful

00:25:06.900 --> 00:25:09.800
instead of making my
relationships implode--

00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:11.090
something like that.

00:25:11.090 --> 00:25:12.182
So I think that's been it.

00:25:12.182 --> 00:25:13.640
But scratching your
own itch-- it's

00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:16.170
like, if you have a
guaranteed market of one,

00:25:16.170 --> 00:25:20.185
i.e. yourself, you're ahead of
99% of the entrepreneurs here.

00:25:20.185 --> 00:25:21.580
JORDAN THIBODEAU: Right.

00:25:21.580 --> 00:25:25.150
Now, you've done almost like,
what, 100-plus podcasts now?

00:25:25.150 --> 00:25:27.060
TIM FERRISS: Probably
150 episodes.

00:25:27.060 --> 00:25:30.310
JORDAN THIBODEAU: So now you
have a wide enough sample

00:25:30.310 --> 00:25:32.880
size to see of these
successful people,

00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:35.040
are you seeing
commonalities that

00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:38.020
is leading to their
success in their careers?

00:25:38.020 --> 00:25:40.020
TIM FERRISS: I think there
are a few things come

00:25:40.020 --> 00:25:40.830
to mind right away.

00:25:40.830 --> 00:25:44.600
The first is-- now, this
could be a selection bias.

00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:47.390
Maybe I'm choosing
people who are

00:25:47.390 --> 00:25:50.390
more prone to have certain
things in common than others

00:25:50.390 --> 00:25:55.290
or I'm attracted to people
in a way that biases this.

00:25:55.290 --> 00:25:58.630
But at least 80%
of the people I've

00:25:58.630 --> 00:26:02.250
interviewed across all domains
have a daily meditation

00:26:02.250 --> 00:26:05.490
practice of some type.

00:26:05.490 --> 00:26:08.370
Certainly, if you want to
cut down on monkey mind,

00:26:08.370 --> 00:26:10.620
the first step is just
to become aware of it

00:26:10.620 --> 00:26:14.480
and kind of observe it,
like a really shitty comedy

00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:15.380
in your head.

00:26:15.380 --> 00:26:17.050
So what is my brain doing?

00:26:17.050 --> 00:26:19.160
This doesn't make any sense.

00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:22.700
And 20 minutes in the morning
is a great way to do that.

00:26:22.700 --> 00:26:29.050
And I'm not particularly in
favor of one versus another.

00:26:29.050 --> 00:26:30.775
I found TM,
transcendental meditation,

00:26:30.775 --> 00:26:32.570
to be very helpful
because it's presented

00:26:32.570 --> 00:26:33.570
in a very secular way.

00:26:33.570 --> 00:26:37.310
And I find the white
noise of a mantra--

00:26:37.310 --> 00:26:40.430
the word mantra bugs me so
much, but a word that you

00:26:40.430 --> 00:26:43.540
repeat over and over
again-- to be very helpful.

00:26:43.540 --> 00:26:46.060
But Vipassana-- there's
a good book called

00:26:46.060 --> 00:26:47.420
"Waking Up" by Sam Harris.

00:26:47.420 --> 00:26:48.902
Sam Harris is PhD
in neuroscience.

00:26:48.902 --> 00:26:50.860
He's been on the podcast
and talked about this.

00:26:50.860 --> 00:26:52.680
Tara Brach-- also fantastic.

00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:55.000
80%-plus have some type
of meditation practice,

00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:58.200
even if they don't
call it meditation.

00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:00.060
So I've, for
instance, interviewed

00:27:00.060 --> 00:27:03.280
Amelia Boone-- incredible
endurance athlete,

00:27:03.280 --> 00:27:08.410
the most successful female
endurance athlete in obstacle

00:27:08.410 --> 00:27:09.550
course racing in the world.

00:27:09.550 --> 00:27:12.370
But also in 2012 at the
World's Toughest Mudder,

00:27:12.370 --> 00:27:14.160
I think it was about
1,200 competitors

00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:15.471
and probably 90% male.

00:27:15.471 --> 00:27:17.220
She came in second
place out of everybody.

00:27:17.220 --> 00:27:18.250
That's a 24-hour race.

00:27:18.250 --> 00:27:20.640
And she is super tough.

00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:23.000
And she said, well,
I don't really

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:24.220
have a meditation practice.

00:27:24.220 --> 00:27:26.178
And I was like what you
do when you're running?

00:27:26.178 --> 00:27:29.120
And she's like, I either
listen to one track

00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:31.460
over and over again, or I
sing one track to myself

00:27:31.460 --> 00:27:31.900
over and over again.

00:27:31.900 --> 00:27:33.270
I was like, well, that
sound a whole hell

00:27:33.270 --> 00:27:34.770
of a lot like meditation to me.

00:27:34.770 --> 00:27:35.770
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:35.770 --> 00:27:40.050
And then Arnold
Schwarzenegger, for instance--

00:27:40.050 --> 00:27:42.830
this was a really cool example.

00:27:42.830 --> 00:27:45.270
He does everything 100% Arnold.

00:27:45.270 --> 00:27:47.010
When he goes, he really goes.

00:27:47.010 --> 00:27:49.690
And he did-- I think, it was
transcendental meditation

00:27:49.690 --> 00:27:50.937
for a year.

00:27:50.937 --> 00:27:53.520
And then he felt like he hit a
certain plateau in the benefits

00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:55.290
and he stopped.

00:27:55.290 --> 00:27:59.850
But he said that the benefits
persisted for decades-- very,

00:27:59.850 --> 00:28:01.587
very cool idea.

00:28:04.290 --> 00:28:06.670
The prospect of that
is very exciting.

00:28:06.670 --> 00:28:09.500
So meditation would be one.

00:28:09.500 --> 00:28:14.910
Two-- of the males,
and we could theorize

00:28:14.910 --> 00:28:17.250
as to why this is the
case-- but of the males,

00:28:17.250 --> 00:28:22.270
a high percentage
of the interviewees

00:28:22.270 --> 00:28:26.780
over the age of 50
skip breakfast-- very

00:28:26.780 --> 00:28:28.420
high percentage.

00:28:28.420 --> 00:28:34.130
Wim Hof, General Stanley
McChrystal, tick, tick, tick,

00:28:34.130 --> 00:28:37.760
tick-- there's a long
list-- Pavel Tsatsouline,

00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:41.610
the Russian who effectively
brought kettlebells to the US.

00:28:41.610 --> 00:28:44.030
I remember I asked him-- my
usual sound check question is

00:28:44.030 --> 00:28:45.280
what'd you have for breakfast?

00:28:45.280 --> 00:28:47.680
And he was like, breakfast?

00:28:47.680 --> 00:28:49.281
Coffee.

00:28:49.281 --> 00:28:51.030
I was like we need
more for a sound check.

00:28:51.030 --> 00:28:52.696
He's like Tim, I like
to keep it simple.

00:28:52.696 --> 00:28:56.070
I was like, ah, all
right, all right.

00:28:56.070 --> 00:28:59.560
Pavel was awesome-- one
of my favorite episodes.

00:28:59.560 --> 00:29:04.350
Let's see-- I find just as
interesting as the patterns,

00:29:04.350 --> 00:29:08.970
I find the differences
reassuring because, of course,

00:29:08.970 --> 00:29:11.100
I think we're pattern
recognition machines.

00:29:11.100 --> 00:29:12.860
So I'm looking for the secrets.

00:29:12.860 --> 00:29:18.850
It's like, OK, just net-net,
what do 80% of these people

00:29:18.850 --> 00:29:20.780
have in common so
I can just do that?

00:29:20.780 --> 00:29:21.620
That's my recipe.

00:29:21.620 --> 00:29:23.660
And then I'll have
everything that I

00:29:23.660 --> 00:29:25.900
want-- great-- do everything
that I want, be happy.

00:29:25.900 --> 00:29:27.120
Oh, that'd be fantastic.

00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:28.980
But what I've
realized over time is

00:29:28.980 --> 00:29:33.602
that what appears to be the case
because you have-- at first,

00:29:33.602 --> 00:29:35.810
I was interviewing all these
people and they're like,

00:29:35.810 --> 00:29:37.320
I wake up at 4:30
in the morning.

00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:40.160
Like Jocko Willink, the most
decorated special operations

00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:44.000
commander from the Iraq War--
he was like wake up at 4:30.

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:46.780
And I had a string of about
10 of these interviews

00:29:46.780 --> 00:29:48.450
where they're like, I wake up
at 4:30, I wake up at 5:00.

00:29:48.450 --> 00:29:50.783
And I was like oh, god, I
don't want to wake up at 4:30.

00:29:50.783 --> 00:29:52.800
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:52.800 --> 00:29:56.340
For me, I'm waking up at the ass
crack of dawn is, like, 8:30.

00:29:56.340 --> 00:29:59.621
That's a major effort for me
because I go to bed so late.

00:29:59.621 --> 00:30:02.120
And I've historically done all
my best writing between 11:00

00:30:02.120 --> 00:30:04.944
PM and 4:00 or 5:00 AM.

00:30:04.944 --> 00:30:08.300
And then I had a few folks
who are very late night.

00:30:08.300 --> 00:30:10.174
And I was like, oh, thank god.

00:30:10.174 --> 00:30:11.550
Whew, that was close.

00:30:11.550 --> 00:30:14.370
And what I realized is--
and there's a quote--

00:30:14.370 --> 00:30:16.870
I'm going to massacre it, but
I'm going to paraphrase here--

00:30:16.870 --> 00:30:18.694
that I think is WH
Auden-- A-U-D-E-N--

00:30:18.694 --> 00:30:20.360
I might be getting
the last name wrong--

00:30:20.360 --> 00:30:26.100
but that routine in the
intelligent man-- person--

00:30:26.100 --> 00:30:29.610
routine in an intelligent
man is a sign of ambition.

00:30:29.610 --> 00:30:31.330
And I think that
what is important

00:30:31.330 --> 00:30:33.870
is not having a
specific routine.

00:30:33.870 --> 00:30:36.490
It's having a routine.

00:30:36.490 --> 00:30:39.250
That's it, like you
have a routine that

00:30:39.250 --> 00:30:41.620
allows you to preserve
your decision-making

00:30:41.620 --> 00:30:44.800
and your creativity
hit points-- sorry,

00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:47.190
Dungeons &amp; Dragons--
for the things

00:30:47.190 --> 00:30:49.455
that actually matter so
that you're not waking up

00:30:49.455 --> 00:30:51.360
and every morning deciding
what to have for breakfast.

00:30:51.360 --> 00:30:52.776
You're not waking
up every morning

00:30:52.776 --> 00:30:55.500
and maybe deciding what to
wear-- Steve Jobs, et cetera.

00:30:55.500 --> 00:30:59.010
I have quite a few friends who
wear the same thing effectively

00:30:59.010 --> 00:31:01.330
every day.

00:31:01.330 --> 00:31:06.500
So in what ways can you preserve
your decision-making budget,

00:31:06.500 --> 00:31:08.850
your creativity
budget, for the things

00:31:08.850 --> 00:31:14.480
that you are uniquely good
at and that really matter?

00:31:14.480 --> 00:31:18.270
And the answer seems to
have a lot of routines.

00:31:18.270 --> 00:31:21.050
And you can have
your own routines.

00:31:21.050 --> 00:31:23.530
But what's important is
that you have a routine

00:31:23.530 --> 00:31:27.720
or routines that you stick
to for periods of time.

00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:30.950
That seems to be-- and there
are many, many, many, many, many

00:31:30.950 --> 00:31:32.570
different routines.

00:31:32.570 --> 00:31:35.800
But those would be a few.

00:31:35.800 --> 00:31:39.300
A lot of them-- the majority
of them-- are insomniacs.

00:31:39.300 --> 00:31:40.904
So take heart.

00:31:40.904 --> 00:31:43.320
Just because you're insomniac
doesn't make you successful,

00:31:43.320 --> 00:31:47.730
but seems to be a symptom
or a common side effect

00:31:47.730 --> 00:31:49.850
of a lot of their behavior.

00:31:49.850 --> 00:31:54.020
And then scratching their
own itch-- almost all of them

00:31:54.020 --> 00:31:54.990
scratch their own itch.

00:31:54.990 --> 00:31:58.820
And this is actually
super important.

00:31:58.820 --> 00:32:01.920
I think there's a lot of rah-rah
motivational speaker business

00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:04.040
advice out there that
is utter horseshit.

00:32:04.040 --> 00:32:10.380
And I think one of the
biggest delusions, illusions,

00:32:10.380 --> 00:32:14.040
or just hoaxes is
optimism, think big,

00:32:14.040 --> 00:32:15.610
the passion's
going to drive you,

00:32:15.610 --> 00:32:17.860
like that's how the people
who are really successful

00:32:17.860 --> 00:32:18.889
are successful.

00:32:18.889 --> 00:32:21.180
That might be the story you
read about in the magazines

00:32:21.180 --> 00:32:24.170
because it makes for a fun
hero's journey type of story.

00:32:24.170 --> 00:32:29.310
But the people
that I've been most

00:32:29.310 --> 00:32:33.750
impressed by ask themselves
all the time, what

00:32:33.750 --> 00:32:35.670
is the worst-case scenario?

00:32:35.670 --> 00:32:37.630
They're budgeting
for the downside.

00:32:37.630 --> 00:32:40.730
So in other words,
they're not using optimism

00:32:40.730 --> 00:32:41.939
to allow them to take action.

00:32:41.939 --> 00:32:43.521
They're not just,
like, you know what?

00:32:43.521 --> 00:32:46.230
I'm going to jump off the cliff
and grow wings on the way down,

00:32:46.230 --> 00:32:50.110
or whatever the
cliche is that you

00:32:50.110 --> 00:32:53.220
might find on a calendar
in "Office Space."

00:32:53.220 --> 00:32:53.720
No.

00:32:53.720 --> 00:32:57.790
They're saying the way that I do
things that other people think

00:32:57.790 --> 00:33:00.730
are high-risk or other
people think are risky,

00:33:00.730 --> 00:33:05.280
dangerous, whatever it might
be, is because I write down

00:33:05.280 --> 00:33:07.427
the worst-case
scenarios, ask myself

00:33:07.427 --> 00:33:09.760
what could I do to mitigate
these things from happening.

00:33:09.760 --> 00:33:11.560
And I ask myself if they
happen, what can I do

00:33:11.560 --> 00:33:12.809
to get back to where I am now?

00:33:12.809 --> 00:33:16.410
And I realize these "risky"
things are not risky at all.

00:33:16.410 --> 00:33:18.330
They're totally reversible.

00:33:18.330 --> 00:33:21.210
They're just speed bumps if
anything goes wrong, really,

00:33:21.210 --> 00:33:22.760
in the grand scheme of things.

00:33:22.760 --> 00:33:25.710
And so they get
a lot of at-bats.

00:33:25.710 --> 00:33:27.610
They're really good at
capping the downside.

00:33:27.610 --> 00:33:29.340
Branson has said this.

00:33:29.340 --> 00:33:31.470
As much as he has a
lot of rah-rah stuff,

00:33:31.470 --> 00:33:33.053
you drill down into
it, it's like he's

00:33:33.053 --> 00:33:35.710
really good at deciding
what is the most I can lose

00:33:35.710 --> 00:33:41.250
if I do x, what is the most
time that I can lose if we do y,

00:33:41.250 --> 00:33:47.730
and then making decisions based
on that sort of lost limit,

00:33:47.730 --> 00:33:49.290
if that makes sense.

00:33:49.290 --> 00:33:53.090
So that's very heartening
because I've never been--

00:33:53.090 --> 00:33:55.660
I would like to say I'm a
follow my passion kind of guy.

00:33:55.660 --> 00:33:56.810
I get excited about things.

00:33:56.810 --> 00:33:58.280
I want to scratch my own itch.

00:33:58.280 --> 00:34:00.760
But I think that
the real toolkit

00:34:00.760 --> 00:34:04.210
is getting really good at asking
is this the condition that I so

00:34:04.210 --> 00:34:04.710
feared?

00:34:04.710 --> 00:34:06.520
What if?

00:34:06.520 --> 00:34:10.679
And once you sort of neuter
the worst-case scenarios

00:34:10.679 --> 00:34:14.350
and depower them, you're
like, oh, yeah, this is fine.

00:34:14.350 --> 00:34:15.939
This is totally fine.

00:34:15.939 --> 00:34:18.989
It's not any riskier than just
investing and watching a new TV

00:34:18.989 --> 00:34:20.710
series on Netflix-- like
maybe get three episodes in,

00:34:20.710 --> 00:34:22.210
you're like damn
it, I can't believe

00:34:22.210 --> 00:34:24.050
I watched three
hours of this crap.

00:34:24.050 --> 00:34:25.139
You choose another series.

00:34:25.139 --> 00:34:26.139
It's not the end of the world.

00:34:26.139 --> 00:34:27.060
JORDAN THIBODEAU: Right.

00:34:27.060 --> 00:34:27.260
Right.

00:34:27.260 --> 00:34:27.800
No, it's true.

00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:29.424
TIM FERRISS: "Narcos"--
watch "Narcos."

00:34:29.424 --> 00:34:30.620
JORDAN THIBODEAU: Very good.

00:34:30.620 --> 00:34:31.980
Can't wait for season two.

00:34:31.980 --> 00:34:33.420
TIM FERRISS:
(WHISPERING) So good.

00:34:33.420 --> 00:34:37.120
Oh, that was such a
head fake at the end.

00:34:37.120 --> 00:34:38.630
But I'm kind of happy.

00:34:38.630 --> 00:34:39.511
Sorry, I digress.

00:34:39.511 --> 00:34:40.831
JORDAN THIBODEAU: I know.

00:34:40.831 --> 00:34:42.330
TIM FERRISS:
"Billions"-- also good.

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:46.050
But I digress again.

00:34:46.050 --> 00:34:46.199
JORDAN THIBODEAU: No.

00:34:46.199 --> 00:34:47.800
When I saw "Narcos,"
I didn't actually--

00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:48.910
like some of the things
that happened, I was like,

00:34:48.910 --> 00:34:50.007
did this really happen?

00:34:50.007 --> 00:34:51.510
TIM FERRISS: Oh, yeah.

00:34:51.510 --> 00:34:55.300
I've spent a good amount of time
in Colombia and in Medellin,

00:34:55.300 --> 00:34:57.770
on a road that was
called the Road of Death

00:34:57.770 --> 00:35:00.650
because Pablo
Escobar's henchmen used

00:35:00.650 --> 00:35:02.920
to drop dead bodies down
ravines on either side

00:35:02.920 --> 00:35:05.567
and they would just
be piled with bodies.

00:35:05.567 --> 00:35:07.900
JORDAN THIBODEAU: That's
really hard to transition back.

00:35:07.900 --> 00:35:09.310
TIM FERRISS: So next time
you're stuck on 101 in traffic

00:35:09.310 --> 00:35:11.668
and you're cursing the
gods, be like, well,

00:35:11.668 --> 00:35:15.940
at least the sides of the road
aren't littered with bodies--

00:35:15.940 --> 00:35:17.730
could be a lot worse.

00:35:17.730 --> 00:35:18.900
Could be a lot worse.

00:35:18.900 --> 00:35:21.540
JORDAN THIBODEAU:
So period-- break.

00:35:21.540 --> 00:35:22.870
TIM FERRISS: Period, semicolon.

00:35:22.870 --> 00:35:24.286
JORDAN THIBODEAU:
Next transition.

00:35:24.286 --> 00:35:25.829
TIM FERRISS: Don't
use semicolons.

00:35:25.829 --> 00:35:28.120
JORDAN THIBODEAU: I've seen
many careers ended on this.

00:35:28.120 --> 00:35:29.203
TIM FERRISS: Or em dashes.

00:35:29.203 --> 00:35:31.667
I love em dashes-- so lazy.

00:35:31.667 --> 00:35:33.250
JORDAN THIBODEAU:
Now, are there plans

00:35:33.250 --> 00:35:36.000
to write a book
about these podcasts

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:37.350
and the experiences you've had?

00:35:37.350 --> 00:35:38.933
TIM FERRISS: I've
been toying with it.

00:35:38.933 --> 00:35:42.390
I put some feelers
out on social media

00:35:42.390 --> 00:35:45.062
to see if people will be
interested because usually,

00:35:45.062 --> 00:35:46.520
when I end up doing
something, it's

00:35:46.520 --> 00:35:49.450
when it's less painful to
do it than to not do it.

00:35:49.450 --> 00:35:52.900
So the insomnia for
me-- I'm much better

00:35:52.900 --> 00:35:55.400
at getting asleep, much
better at falling asleep.

00:35:55.400 --> 00:35:58.950
But usually when I end up
pulling a trigger on something,

00:35:58.950 --> 00:36:02.530
it's when it keeps me up for
four or five nights straight

00:36:02.530 --> 00:36:03.930
and just the ideas are coming.

00:36:03.930 --> 00:36:07.080
And I'm like god,
stop, make it stop.

00:36:07.080 --> 00:36:08.160
I want to go to sleep.

00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:10.407
But it's that
excitement good stuff,

00:36:10.407 --> 00:36:12.240
which is how "The 4-Hour
Workweek" happened.

00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:13.900
It was waking up and
writing down stuff.

00:36:13.900 --> 00:36:15.575
And like let me go to sleep,
get it out of my head,

00:36:15.575 --> 00:36:16.830
I want to go to sleep.

00:36:16.830 --> 00:36:21.600
And so for the last
week or two, the idea

00:36:21.600 --> 00:36:25.400
of sort of distilling the
patterns and learnings

00:36:25.400 --> 00:36:29.642
and the stuff that was
not in the podcasts,

00:36:29.642 --> 00:36:31.850
also-- like the experiments
that I've done afterwards

00:36:31.850 --> 00:36:33.410
or in between or other
interactions I've

00:36:33.410 --> 00:36:34.784
had with these
guests-- there are

00:36:34.784 --> 00:36:40.640
a lot of just really actionable,
awesome habits and tools

00:36:40.640 --> 00:36:42.379
that I've actually tested.

00:36:42.379 --> 00:36:43.420
Well, let me take a poll.

00:36:43.420 --> 00:36:46.810
So how many people here have
listened to the podcast?

00:36:46.810 --> 00:36:47.580
All right.

00:36:47.580 --> 00:36:49.750
Of those people,
how many would be

00:36:49.750 --> 00:36:55.280
interested in a distilled
synopsis of the best

00:36:55.280 --> 00:36:57.311
lessons learned in the podcast?

00:36:57.311 --> 00:36:57.810
All right.

00:36:57.810 --> 00:36:59.910
So it's like a 60%, 70%.

00:36:59.910 --> 00:37:00.410
Yeah.

00:37:00.410 --> 00:37:02.700
I think there's a decent chance.

00:37:02.700 --> 00:37:05.950
I just think it would be--
and I'll tell you why also.

00:37:05.950 --> 00:37:10.200
It's not the reason
you might expect.

00:37:10.200 --> 00:37:14.460
What I suffer from
most, what pains

00:37:14.460 --> 00:37:18.630
me the most about the
podcast, is the embarrassment

00:37:18.630 --> 00:37:21.880
of riches that comes out of
a 2 and 1/2 hour conversation

00:37:21.880 --> 00:37:24.710
because I do-- I have one of
these coming out in a week-- I

00:37:24.710 --> 00:37:28.050
don't have time to actually
digest and reflect on all

00:37:28.050 --> 00:37:29.390
the stuff that I'm putting out.

00:37:29.390 --> 00:37:30.640
I do as much as I can.

00:37:30.640 --> 00:37:32.680
But I just don't
have the bandwidth.

00:37:32.680 --> 00:37:33.780
And now I've done 150.

00:37:33.780 --> 00:37:35.830
I'm like-- and part
of me's like, I don't

00:37:35.830 --> 00:37:37.830
need to interview anybody else.

00:37:37.830 --> 00:37:38.715
This is enough.

00:37:38.715 --> 00:37:40.340
And I want to do it
because I enjoy it.

00:37:40.340 --> 00:37:43.010
But I'm like if you
can't figure out

00:37:43.010 --> 00:37:46.000
how to improve any aspect of
your life from these 150 people

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:48.090
across 100 different
disciplines,

00:37:48.090 --> 00:37:52.110
you're an idiot-- like Tim
Ferriss talking to myself.

00:37:52.110 --> 00:37:54.420
So it's like go back and review.

00:37:54.420 --> 00:37:56.010
Review, idiot.

00:37:56.010 --> 00:37:57.520
You've done tests before.

00:37:57.520 --> 00:37:58.950
Life is the test.

00:37:58.950 --> 00:38:02.510
Start studying, or you're
going to have a panic attack.

00:38:02.510 --> 00:38:07.300
So if I were to go back and
try to distill all this stuff,

00:38:07.300 --> 00:38:10.020
it would give me the
incentive and opportunity

00:38:10.020 --> 00:38:12.890
to do exactly that, to go
back and actually pull out

00:38:12.890 --> 00:38:16.520
all these things and be like,
oh my god, that's right.

00:38:16.520 --> 00:38:19.180
The most successful people
in the business and investing

00:38:19.180 --> 00:38:21.660
realm recommended
"Sapiens," this book

00:38:21.660 --> 00:38:23.230
on evolutionary
biology, effectively.

00:38:23.230 --> 00:38:24.330
It's like, that's weird.

00:38:24.330 --> 00:38:25.690
Oh, yeah, I forgot about that.

00:38:25.690 --> 00:38:28.121
Maybe I should read "Sapiens."

00:38:28.121 --> 00:38:28.870
Fill in the blank.

00:38:28.870 --> 00:38:30.570
There are so many
examples like that.

00:38:30.570 --> 00:38:32.820
JORDAN THIBODEAU: So it
should be done by July, right?

00:38:32.820 --> 00:38:34.200
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:34.200 --> 00:38:36.130
TIM FERRISS: Alas, I'm
fast at many things.

00:38:36.130 --> 00:38:37.640
Book writing is not one of them.

00:38:37.640 --> 00:38:42.320
But it certainly would
not take as long as some

00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:45.820
of the soul-crushing
projects that I've

00:38:45.820 --> 00:38:49.220
allowed myself to expand from,
like "The 4-Hour Chef" was

00:38:49.220 --> 00:38:50.370
supposed to 250 pages.

00:38:50.370 --> 00:38:53.970
I ended up 670 after
250 pages were cut.

00:38:53.970 --> 00:38:56.240
It's like, what was I thinking?

00:38:56.240 --> 00:38:58.480
Like oh, yeah, I'll do 30%
of the photographs myself.

00:38:58.480 --> 00:38:59.313
How hard could that?

00:38:59.313 --> 00:39:01.890
Oh, yeah, turns
out photography--

00:39:01.890 --> 00:39:03.240
really tough to do well.

00:39:03.240 --> 00:39:05.120
[CHUCKLING]

00:39:05.120 --> 00:39:07.220
So I'm trying to learn
from my mistakes.

00:39:07.220 --> 00:39:09.761
JORDAN THIBODEAU: Where do you
see Tim going in the next five

00:39:09.761 --> 00:39:11.360
years?

00:39:11.360 --> 00:39:13.750
TIM FERRISS: Tim in five years?

00:39:13.750 --> 00:39:17.060
Tim sees Tim-- this
is, like, Hulkspeak.

00:39:17.060 --> 00:39:20.300
I see in the next
five years-- well,

00:39:20.300 --> 00:39:22.940
let me pause before
I answer that

00:39:22.940 --> 00:39:27.040
to say I've never had reliable
five-year plans, 10-year plans,

00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:28.230
or otherwise.

00:39:28.230 --> 00:39:33.000
And I treat my entire life as a
series of two-week experiments

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:36.930
and six-month projects
because-- and maybe this

00:39:36.930 --> 00:39:41.140
is just the way I cope with
life and decision-making--

00:39:41.140 --> 00:39:45.660
but I feel like if you make
a five- or 10-year plan

00:39:45.660 --> 00:39:50.580
that you can reliably
hit, almost by definition,

00:39:50.580 --> 00:39:52.760
you have to set a
plan that is below

00:39:52.760 --> 00:39:55.030
your current capabilities.

00:39:55.030 --> 00:39:57.940
If you're an A student, you
have to set a C-plus plan for it

00:39:57.940 --> 00:40:00.040
to be 100% achievable.

00:40:00.040 --> 00:40:05.427
And I think it's
just a great way

00:40:05.427 --> 00:40:07.510
to paint yourself into a
very unattractive corner.

00:40:07.510 --> 00:40:10.591
So two-week experiments,
six-month projects

00:40:10.591 --> 00:40:12.090
is kind of how I
view my whole life.

00:40:12.090 --> 00:40:19.480
But if I had to guess, I would
say, five years-- less hair,

00:40:19.480 --> 00:40:22.230
better gymnastics, which
is my new thing, one

00:40:22.230 --> 00:40:23.910
of my new things.

00:40:23.910 --> 00:40:27.790
But larger picture,
I see myself doing

00:40:27.790 --> 00:40:30.830
the podcast or some
iteration of it,

00:40:30.830 --> 00:40:35.180
just deconstructing experts
and world-class performers

00:40:35.180 --> 00:40:37.540
on a much, much larger scale.

00:40:37.540 --> 00:40:39.930
I think it'll be
10-- I think and want

00:40:39.930 --> 00:40:42.710
it to be 10 times bigger
without sacrificing

00:40:42.710 --> 00:40:45.380
the nitty-gritty, the nerdiness,
or going into the details.

00:40:45.380 --> 00:40:48.010
It's like if I want to talk
about exogenous ketones-- which

00:40:48.010 --> 00:40:51.450
by the way, internet, are not
androgynous ketones-- exogenous

00:40:51.450 --> 00:40:53.390
ketones outside the
body with Dom D'Agostino

00:40:53.390 --> 00:40:55.570
and talk about Navy SEALs
and rebreathers and all

00:40:55.570 --> 00:40:57.850
this geeky shit for
an hour and a half,

00:40:57.850 --> 00:40:59.590
that's what I'm going to do.

00:40:59.590 --> 00:41:02.970
And if I'm having fun,
hopefully other people will.

00:41:02.970 --> 00:41:05.970
And I think that will continue
to be a component because

00:41:05.970 --> 00:41:07.460
whether or not
I'm publishing it,

00:41:07.460 --> 00:41:09.110
that's what I'm doing, anyway.

00:41:09.110 --> 00:41:10.990
So I'd like to-- but
by doing it publicly,

00:41:10.990 --> 00:41:13.490
I force myself to get better.

00:41:13.490 --> 00:41:19.350
It's a strong incentive
to refine the blade.

00:41:19.350 --> 00:41:22.406
I think that there's a
chance I'll have a family.

00:41:22.406 --> 00:41:23.530
We'll see about that stuff.

00:41:23.530 --> 00:41:25.440
Want to have a conversation
about my thoughts on marriage

00:41:25.440 --> 00:41:27.970
and relationships, that's
a whole separate thing that

00:41:27.970 --> 00:41:29.750
requires a lot more tequila.

00:41:29.750 --> 00:41:30.755
JORDAN THIBODEAU: Or
maybe a "4-Hour Workweek"

00:41:30.755 --> 00:41:31.380
on raising [INAUDIBLE].

00:41:31.380 --> 00:41:33.171
TIM FERRISS: That's a
whole separate thing.

00:41:33.171 --> 00:41:35.081
"4-Hour Parent" not
coming any time soon.

00:41:35.081 --> 00:41:37.367
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:37.367 --> 00:41:39.700
Somebody was like, what about
"The 4-Hour Relationship"?

00:41:39.700 --> 00:41:42.850
I'm like, what is that, a
guide to one-night stands?

00:41:42.850 --> 00:41:45.400
That's a best-case scenario.

00:41:45.400 --> 00:41:47.520
Feel like other people
have written that book--

00:41:47.520 --> 00:41:50.010
don't need to do it.

00:41:50.010 --> 00:41:53.020
So I think five
years from now, I

00:41:53.020 --> 00:41:59.070
hope to be better
at simplifying.

00:41:59.070 --> 00:42:01.480
I think I'm good, but
I know I can be better.

00:42:01.480 --> 00:42:05.140
I would like to-- this is
the first time in a long time

00:42:05.140 --> 00:42:09.220
that I've ever said this-- I
want to still be doing what

00:42:09.220 --> 00:42:10.560
I'm doing with the podcast.

00:42:10.560 --> 00:42:11.980
I'm just really loving it.

00:42:11.980 --> 00:42:13.910
And with books,
if anybody-- well,

00:42:13.910 --> 00:42:14.770
I know there are people
in the audience who

00:42:14.770 --> 00:42:15.561
have written books.

00:42:15.561 --> 00:42:17.970
And I'm not going to have
anybody confess their sins now.

00:42:17.970 --> 00:42:20.020
But it's like you
get through a book--

00:42:20.020 --> 00:42:22.575
and I remember I was 90%
done with "The 4-Hour Body"

00:42:22.575 --> 00:42:23.950
and I was talking
to this author.

00:42:23.950 --> 00:42:26.760
I'm like, god, I'm
so bored of this.

00:42:26.760 --> 00:42:30.060
Oh my god, I can't stand
rereading these chapters.

00:42:30.060 --> 00:42:31.112
I'm 90% done.

00:42:31.112 --> 00:42:31.820
I'm almost there.

00:42:31.820 --> 00:42:33.080
He goes, oh congratulations.

00:42:33.080 --> 00:42:34.260
You only have 50% left.

00:42:34.260 --> 00:42:39.060
And I was like, oh
god, you're so right.

00:42:39.060 --> 00:42:41.790
And it's just so painful to
give birth to these things.

00:42:41.790 --> 00:42:44.440
It's like crowning with
Tony Robbins' head.

00:42:44.440 --> 00:42:47.610
That sounds terrible.

00:42:47.610 --> 00:42:48.510
Tony, I love you.

00:42:48.510 --> 00:42:49.093
You know that.

00:42:49.093 --> 00:42:50.802
But it's just like an
image of birthing--

00:42:50.802 --> 00:42:53.092
JORDAN THIBODEAU: I would
have preferred "Total Recall"

00:42:53.092 --> 00:42:53.610
with Arnold.

00:42:53.610 --> 00:42:54.600
TIM FERRISS: Or Arnold.

00:42:54.600 --> 00:42:55.960
JORDAN THIBODEAU:
Claudia or something.

00:42:55.960 --> 00:42:56.710
TIM FERRISS: Yeah.

00:42:56.710 --> 00:42:59.070
So probably also painful
and kind of freaky.

00:42:59.070 --> 00:43:03.720
So let that haunt
your dreams, everyone.

00:43:03.720 --> 00:43:06.080
But with the podcast,
it's like when

00:43:06.080 --> 00:43:08.762
I finish a good interview--
I did one with BJ Miller--

00:43:08.762 --> 00:43:10.720
especially with someone
who's not widely known.

00:43:10.720 --> 00:43:14.210
BJ Miller is a palliative
care and hospice

00:43:14.210 --> 00:43:18.830
expert who's helped 1,000 people
or so transition to death.

00:43:18.830 --> 00:43:20.345
And I finished.

00:43:20.345 --> 00:43:24.110
And I was like, I feel so
much smarter after having

00:43:24.110 --> 00:43:25.920
had this conversation.

00:43:25.920 --> 00:43:30.380
And it just makes me so stoked
to do it again a week later.

00:43:30.380 --> 00:43:34.890
So I want to be continuing
along those lines.

00:43:34.890 --> 00:43:38.729
But I fully expect that
doors will close that I

00:43:38.729 --> 00:43:39.770
think are currently open.

00:43:39.770 --> 00:43:43.060
Doors will open that I don't
even know exist at the moment.

00:43:43.060 --> 00:43:48.400
And that's part of the two-week
experiment, six-month project

00:43:48.400 --> 00:43:48.970
plan.

00:43:48.970 --> 00:43:50.020
So I'm OK with that.

00:43:50.020 --> 00:43:53.690
And that's part of what makes
it exciting, quite frankly.

00:43:53.690 --> 00:43:56.560
If I had a predictable plan, I
think I would run out of steam.

00:43:56.560 --> 00:44:01.240
I wouldn't have the gasoline
or the electricity--

00:44:01.240 --> 00:44:06.020
those of you who drive
Teslas-- to make it work.

00:44:06.020 --> 00:44:09.060
And I don't think I take
myself too seriously.

00:44:09.060 --> 00:44:12.700
But I hope to even
to a greater extent

00:44:12.700 --> 00:44:15.540
be embracing and creating
absurdity in the world

00:44:15.540 --> 00:44:18.680
and laughing at myself
because I think it's very

00:44:18.680 --> 00:44:20.237
hard to get anything serious.

00:44:20.237 --> 00:44:22.820
I think it's really hard to get
anything truly big and serious

00:44:22.820 --> 00:44:25.830
done if you take
yourself too seriously--

00:44:25.830 --> 00:44:30.480
so another reason why I do drunk
Q&amp;As sometimes on the internet.

00:44:30.480 --> 00:44:33.040
I'm not drunk right now.

00:44:33.040 --> 00:44:35.820
JORDAN THIBODEAU:
I can verify, yeah.

00:44:35.820 --> 00:44:37.910
Final question--
let's say you had

00:44:37.910 --> 00:44:40.530
a personal board of
directors and you

00:44:40.530 --> 00:44:43.360
could put three people on
there, living and dead.

00:44:43.360 --> 00:44:45.200
Who would those people be?

00:44:45.200 --> 00:44:46.908
TIM FERRISS: Personal
board of directors,

00:44:46.908 --> 00:44:50.900
three people-- I would say
first few that come to mind

00:44:50.900 --> 00:44:56.090
would be Benjamin Franklin, the
merry prankster himself-- just

00:44:56.090 --> 00:45:00.930
such a colorful character
and multi-faceted, really

00:45:00.930 --> 00:45:04.210
incredible amateur
who was able to best

00:45:04.210 --> 00:45:06.380
a lot of the professionals
because of that beginner

00:45:06.380 --> 00:45:08.290
mind and lack of fear.

00:45:08.290 --> 00:45:13.540
And I think that prankster-like
nature was very helpful.

00:45:13.540 --> 00:45:16.520
The Walter Isaacson biography
of Franklin is so good.

00:45:16.520 --> 00:45:20.195
It's so, so good.

00:45:20.195 --> 00:45:23.180
It slows down for me in
the sort of last third.

00:45:23.180 --> 00:45:25.660
But the beginnings
are so incredible.

00:45:25.660 --> 00:45:27.990
They're really fantastic,
highly recommended.

00:45:27.990 --> 00:45:31.630
Second-- Richard
Feynman probably,

00:45:31.630 --> 00:45:36.270
the physicist, I guess from
Caltech, largely associated

00:45:36.270 --> 00:45:41.080
with Caltech-- another
prankster-- just

00:45:41.080 --> 00:45:45.400
another polymath/prankster
who used to in addition

00:45:45.400 --> 00:45:48.250
to being world-class physicist
at Los Alamos and whatnot,

00:45:48.250 --> 00:45:54.349
he became a safe breaker
just to annoy his superiors.

00:45:54.349 --> 00:45:56.140
I wouldn't suggest this
in today's climate.

00:45:56.140 --> 00:45:59.010
But he used to break into
these safes at Los Alamos,

00:45:59.010 --> 00:46:00.880
take out the
top-secret documents,

00:46:00.880 --> 00:46:03.380
and then put them on his boss's
desk and then close the safe

00:46:03.380 --> 00:46:06.697
and just leave
them there to-- not

00:46:06.697 --> 00:46:09.030
for extended periods of time,
but just to cause his boss

00:46:09.030 --> 00:46:12.430
to have a complete
panic attack-- learned

00:46:12.430 --> 00:46:17.060
to play the bongos-- had some
debate with an artist friend

00:46:17.060 --> 00:46:18.270
and they got really fired up.

00:46:18.270 --> 00:46:19.910
And he was like, well, I'm going
to teach you about science.

00:46:19.910 --> 00:46:20.253
And he's like, well, all right.

00:46:20.253 --> 00:46:21.560
Well, I'm going to
teach you how to paint.

00:46:21.560 --> 00:46:22.851
So he got really into painting.

00:46:22.851 --> 00:46:26.850
And he would go into strip
clubs to paint strippers.

00:46:26.850 --> 00:46:28.940
I love this guy.

00:46:28.940 --> 00:46:30.190
He was hilarious.

00:46:30.190 --> 00:46:33.640
So I think Feynman,
although I might not

00:46:33.640 --> 00:46:35.390
be able to get a word
in edgewise with him

00:46:35.390 --> 00:46:37.920
and Franklin at the same table.

00:46:37.920 --> 00:46:42.960
And then probably need some
serious, serious person

00:46:42.960 --> 00:46:44.740
with some scars.

00:46:44.740 --> 00:46:46.670
Not that they aren't
serious, but maybe

00:46:46.670 --> 00:46:48.612
like a Marcus Aurelius type.

00:46:48.612 --> 00:46:51.070
He was somebody who's had the
weight of the world literally

00:46:51.070 --> 00:46:53.278
on their shoulders and has
had to make life and death

00:46:53.278 --> 00:46:55.000
decisions.

00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:58.580
Yeah, I think maybe a
Marcus Aurelius-- not sure

00:46:58.580 --> 00:47:00.219
if I can get him to laugh much.

00:47:00.219 --> 00:47:01.760
Maybe Musashi,
although he'd probably

00:47:01.760 --> 00:47:05.430
kill all of us-- Musashi
Miyamoto, or Miyamoto Musashi.

00:47:05.430 --> 00:47:08.510
Anyway, I'd say Marcus Aurelius.

00:47:08.510 --> 00:47:09.600
I'll go with him.

00:47:09.600 --> 00:47:10.410
JORDAN THIBODEAU: Sounds good.

00:47:10.410 --> 00:47:12.326
AUDIENCE: So thank you
so much for coming out.

00:47:12.326 --> 00:47:14.110
I listen to your
podcast every week.

00:47:14.110 --> 00:47:14.320
TIM FERRISS: Thank you.

00:47:14.320 --> 00:47:15.694
AUDIENCE: And to
can actually see

00:47:15.694 --> 00:47:18.780
a face that moves with
them is a neat experience.

00:47:18.780 --> 00:47:21.395
TIM FERRISS: His head is so
much bigger than I though.

00:47:21.395 --> 00:47:23.520
Do look like a bridge
troll-- I apologize for that.

00:47:23.520 --> 00:47:25.061
AUDIENCE: I look
like a bridge troll?

00:47:25.061 --> 00:47:27.170
TIM FERRISS: No, I look
like a bridge troll.

00:47:27.170 --> 00:47:27.980
Oh, this is good.

00:47:27.980 --> 00:47:30.590
We're getting
all-- limbering up.

00:47:30.590 --> 00:47:31.750
I look like a bridge troll.

00:47:31.750 --> 00:47:32.541
Look at this thing.

00:47:32.541 --> 00:47:35.050
It's like a narwhal
or something.

00:47:35.050 --> 00:47:35.550
All right.

00:47:35.550 --> 00:47:35.980
Continue.

00:47:35.980 --> 00:47:36.250
Sorry.

00:47:36.250 --> 00:47:38.166
AUDIENCE: So I actually
have a Molly question,

00:47:38.166 --> 00:47:39.540
which by the way, where is she?

00:47:39.540 --> 00:47:39.875
TIM FERRISS: Molly?

00:47:39.875 --> 00:47:41.320
AUDIENCE: Totally thought you
would've brought her with you.

00:47:41.320 --> 00:47:42.070
TIM FERRISS: Yeah.

00:47:42.070 --> 00:47:44.080
So Molly my pup.

00:47:44.080 --> 00:47:45.550
She's about 11 months old.

00:47:45.550 --> 00:47:46.650
She is hiking right now.

00:47:46.650 --> 00:47:50.860
So she's probably in the
Marin Headlands with a walker.

00:47:50.860 --> 00:47:53.340
AUDIENCE: That was not
the full my question.

00:47:53.340 --> 00:47:54.840
So I know she's 11 months old.

00:47:54.840 --> 00:47:56.465
I actually have a
nine-month-old puppy,

00:47:56.465 --> 00:47:58.310
so I follow a lot
of what you talk

00:47:58.310 --> 00:48:00.310
about in your 5-Bullet
Fridays about her

00:48:00.310 --> 00:48:02.964
and the toy that spits out food.

00:48:02.964 --> 00:48:05.255
And I know that you do a lot
of testing experimentation

00:48:05.255 --> 00:48:05.834
on yourself.

00:48:05.834 --> 00:48:07.250
And I was just
wondering as you're

00:48:07.250 --> 00:48:09.570
raising a puppy--
not inhumanely,

00:48:09.570 --> 00:48:12.290
but do you do any kind of
testing experimentation

00:48:12.290 --> 00:48:13.099
in her training?

00:48:13.099 --> 00:48:13.890
TIM FERRISS: Right.

00:48:13.890 --> 00:48:15.620
So testing experimentation
with Molly--

00:48:15.620 --> 00:48:19.470
so in between the beatings--
you mentioned humane-- no.

00:48:19.470 --> 00:48:21.890
No beatings, no beatings.

00:48:21.890 --> 00:48:23.740
I'm testing all the time.

00:48:23.740 --> 00:48:25.880
And it's not like
I'm putting her

00:48:25.880 --> 00:48:28.230
in a Skinner box or anything.

00:48:28.230 --> 00:48:34.700
But I think that it is a
great-- as with, I think,

00:48:34.700 --> 00:48:36.940
many things in life-- like
how we do anything is how

00:48:36.940 --> 00:48:39.180
we do everything, sometimes.

00:48:39.180 --> 00:48:43.180
And I've found that getting
better at training Molly,

00:48:43.180 --> 00:48:46.010
being attuned to her
needs, but also being

00:48:46.010 --> 00:48:48.870
consistent with my
training and sequencing

00:48:48.870 --> 00:48:51.820
the training in the right way--
so just in "The 4-Hour Chef"

00:48:51.820 --> 00:48:54.847
when I talk about meta learning
and DSSS-- deconstruction,

00:48:54.847 --> 00:48:56.430
selection, sequencing--
and I approach

00:48:56.430 --> 00:49:00.077
dog training the same way, which
is really just animal training,

00:49:00.077 --> 00:49:00.785
including humans.

00:49:00.785 --> 00:49:04.400
So "Don't Shoot the Dog"--
great framework to start with.

00:49:04.400 --> 00:49:07.390
And I think crate
training-- huge.

00:49:07.390 --> 00:49:10.290
Even if you have an
older dog, I think

00:49:10.290 --> 00:49:15.290
that clicker training for just
precision-- super helpful.

00:49:15.290 --> 00:49:18.640
Karen Pryor's pretty
good for that, also.

00:49:18.640 --> 00:49:23.920
And training for attention as a
prerequisite to all other skill

00:49:23.920 --> 00:49:29.750
training-- and you can do that
very easily by, for instance,

00:49:29.750 --> 00:49:32.307
getting a treat in one hand
and a clicker in the other.

00:49:32.307 --> 00:49:34.390
And you hold the treat in
front of your dog's face

00:49:34.390 --> 00:49:37.590
after they sit and then you
hold the treat out to the side.

00:49:37.590 --> 00:49:39.010
Their eyes will travel with it.

00:49:39.010 --> 00:49:40.400
Wait until their eyes
come back to your eyes.

00:49:40.400 --> 00:49:42.858
And then you click the clicker
and you give them the treat.

00:49:42.858 --> 00:49:45.110
And by doing that
in various ways,

00:49:45.110 --> 00:49:49.910
you instill in them the habit
of constantly checking in

00:49:49.910 --> 00:49:52.490
with you using eye contact.

00:49:52.490 --> 00:49:57.390
And it makes everything
else-- come, sit, stay, down--

00:49:57.390 --> 00:49:58.460
infinitely easier.

00:49:58.460 --> 00:50:00.700
So thinking about how
to sequence those skills

00:50:00.700 --> 00:50:03.280
is very fun.

00:50:03.280 --> 00:50:08.390
Training for safety
first, trick second--

00:50:08.390 --> 00:50:10.820
it's also also something I
looked very carefully at.

00:50:10.820 --> 00:50:15.380
So I will do timed
stays, so like down stay.

00:50:15.380 --> 00:50:18.130
And I'll do, like, she has
to do it for five minutes

00:50:18.130 --> 00:50:21.610
and then I'll give her the
Beluga caviar of dog treats.

00:50:21.610 --> 00:50:26.760
But to do that, you also
need a no-reward marker.

00:50:26.760 --> 00:50:28.260
There are different
ways to do this.

00:50:28.260 --> 00:50:30.480
So the reward marker
would be click, treat.

00:50:30.480 --> 00:50:32.680
No-reward marker--
you can use uh-oh.

00:50:32.680 --> 00:50:34.470
You can use different
types of verbal cues

00:50:34.470 --> 00:50:38.340
to say you screwed
up, in other words.

00:50:38.340 --> 00:50:42.200
And always getting
your dog-- sorry,

00:50:42.200 --> 00:50:44.360
this is something
I'm really into-- so

00:50:44.360 --> 00:50:47.720
using sit for please
is another thing that I

00:50:47.720 --> 00:50:52.700
think is very helpful for safety
and as a prerequisite skill.

00:50:52.700 --> 00:50:57.220
Any time she wants
anything, sit.

00:50:57.220 --> 00:50:58.589
And that's like duh, OK.

00:50:58.589 --> 00:50:59.880
Tell me something I don't know.

00:50:59.880 --> 00:51:02.150
But I'll give you a variation
they might not think of.

00:51:02.150 --> 00:51:05.090
Any time I open a
door, she sits first.

00:51:05.090 --> 00:51:07.180
I go out next.

00:51:07.180 --> 00:51:08.160
Then she looks at me.

00:51:08.160 --> 00:51:09.009
And I go OK.

00:51:09.009 --> 00:51:10.300
And she comes through the door.

00:51:10.300 --> 00:51:11.620
This means your
dog never jumps out

00:51:11.620 --> 00:51:13.120
of the car when you
open a hatchback

00:51:13.120 --> 00:51:17.040
and gets hit by another
car-- will never happen.

00:51:17.040 --> 00:51:19.280
If-- well, I shouldn't say
never-- never say never.

00:51:19.280 --> 00:51:21.749
But you've just decreased
the likelihood infinitely.

00:51:21.749 --> 00:51:24.040
So those are a few things
that I've played around with.

00:51:24.040 --> 00:51:26.000
But I think the
sequencing of skills

00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:27.510
is something that
most dog training

00:51:27.510 --> 00:51:29.290
books do extremely poorly.

00:51:29.290 --> 00:51:32.500
There's one book that I'm
hoping to acquire and just give

00:51:32.500 --> 00:51:34.360
away for free, quite frankly.

00:51:34.360 --> 00:51:35.500
It's really thin.

00:51:35.500 --> 00:51:38.340
It's called "Command
Performance."

00:51:38.340 --> 00:51:43.470
And it's a short compilation
of, like, two pages per behavior

00:51:43.470 --> 00:51:45.470
put together by the
"Whole Dog Journal."

00:51:45.470 --> 00:51:48.136
I'm sure it's based somewhere in
Northern California with a name

00:51:48.136 --> 00:51:51.590
like that-- maybe Portland.

00:51:51.590 --> 00:51:52.972
And I would start with that.

00:51:52.972 --> 00:51:54.430
I think it'll go
a really long way.

00:51:54.430 --> 00:51:56.846
There also some YouTube channels
that I think are helpful.

00:51:56.846 --> 00:52:00.320
Kikopup-- K-I-K-O pup-- is one
that I've found very helpful.

00:52:00.320 --> 00:52:02.360
But you run into the
same issue that you

00:52:02.360 --> 00:52:05.210
run into with any type
of coach, like jiu-jitsu

00:52:05.210 --> 00:52:07.026
is very problematic
for this, everything

00:52:07.026 --> 00:52:08.400
is, where the
instructor walks in

00:52:08.400 --> 00:52:10.722
and they just kind of decide
on the technique du jour

00:52:10.722 --> 00:52:11.930
and then they teach you that.

00:52:11.930 --> 00:52:13.054
But there's is no sequence.

00:52:13.054 --> 00:52:14.150
There's no progression.

00:52:14.150 --> 00:52:17.360
And with dogs or humans, if
you want the best result,

00:52:17.360 --> 00:52:18.420
you need progression.

00:52:18.420 --> 00:52:19.670
JORDAN THIBODEAU: [INAUDIBLE]

00:52:19.670 --> 00:52:20.419
TIM FERRISS: Yeah.

00:52:20.419 --> 00:52:21.399
Long answer, but--

00:52:21.399 --> 00:52:22.440
JORDAN THIBODEAU: Thanks.

00:52:22.440 --> 00:52:23.950
I have a online question.

00:52:23.950 --> 00:52:26.455
There's a lot of talk and
focus on human longevity.

00:52:26.455 --> 00:52:27.830
What would you
actually recommend

00:52:27.830 --> 00:52:30.100
people begin doing as
they approach their 40s

00:52:30.100 --> 00:52:33.100
and beyond for a
minimum effective dose?

00:52:33.100 --> 00:52:36.530
TIM FERRISS: If you're
40s, it's just too late.

00:52:36.530 --> 00:52:37.920
Pick out your casket at Costco.

00:52:37.920 --> 00:52:40.300
No, I jest.

00:52:40.300 --> 00:52:44.160
I'm almost there myself.

00:52:44.160 --> 00:52:47.785
The preface has to
be I am not a doctor,

00:52:47.785 --> 00:52:49.160
I don't play one
on the internet,

00:52:49.160 --> 00:52:51.060
this is not medical
advice, blah, blah, blah.

00:52:51.060 --> 00:52:52.400
Talk to qualified professionals.

00:52:52.400 --> 00:52:56.590
But if I were to-- or
maybe I am already--

00:52:56.590 --> 00:53:00.520
if I were to pursue
increasing lifespan,

00:53:00.520 --> 00:53:04.224
it would not be at the expense
of performance, number one.

00:53:04.224 --> 00:53:05.640
I just enjoy
performance too much.

00:53:05.640 --> 00:53:11.750
So it can't make me a sexless,
listless, depressed person,

00:53:11.750 --> 00:53:14.310
which a lot of things
that extend lifespan

00:53:14.310 --> 00:53:18.430
do-- like really, really
extended caloric restriction?

00:53:18.430 --> 00:53:20.000
Yeah, have fun with that.

00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:22.744
You'll wish you were
going to die sooner.

00:53:22.744 --> 00:53:23.910
So I'm not going to do that.

00:53:23.910 --> 00:53:28.940
But I do fasts to purge
precancerous cells.

00:53:28.940 --> 00:53:30.630
By the time you're
40, almost everybody

00:53:30.630 --> 00:53:33.030
will have what you could
consider precancerous

00:53:33.030 --> 00:53:34.121
or cancerous cells.

00:53:34.121 --> 00:53:35.870
What you don't want
is uncontrolled growth

00:53:35.870 --> 00:53:36.570
of those cells.

00:53:36.570 --> 00:53:40.180
And you can affect
that by understanding

00:53:40.180 --> 00:53:44.020
the idiosyncrasies
of cancer metabolism.

00:53:44.020 --> 00:53:48.500
But just to keep it simple,
you want to experience ketosis

00:53:48.500 --> 00:53:54.110
and/or fasting for
semi-extended periods of time.

00:53:54.110 --> 00:53:56.919
To me, that means at
least two to three days.

00:53:56.919 --> 00:53:58.210
This is all a work in progress.

00:53:58.210 --> 00:53:59.830
But it's based on
good literature.

00:53:59.830 --> 00:54:03.930
So I would do, say-- I
do one three-day fast,

00:54:03.930 --> 00:54:07.710
meaning water, per month.

00:54:07.710 --> 00:54:11.210
Typically, I'll finish Thursday
dinner and then fast to Sunday

00:54:11.210 --> 00:54:12.240
dinner.

00:54:12.240 --> 00:54:17.690
And I may combine
that with-- this

00:54:17.690 --> 00:54:20.140
is addressing cancer in part.

00:54:20.140 --> 00:54:24.060
There are other mortality
causes, of course.

00:54:24.060 --> 00:54:28.850
But I might use
hyperbaric oxygen

00:54:28.850 --> 00:54:33.070
at, like, 2.5 atmospheres for
60 to 90 minutes three times

00:54:33.070 --> 00:54:34.294
a week.

00:54:34.294 --> 00:54:35.960
That's straight from
Dominic D'Agostino,

00:54:35.960 --> 00:54:37.730
who I had on the
podcast, who's looked

00:54:37.730 --> 00:54:40.460
at the use of
hyperbaric oxygen--

00:54:40.460 --> 00:54:42.430
not only ketogenic
diet and fasting,

00:54:42.430 --> 00:54:44.680
but also exogenous ketones,
like mixing up a powder

00:54:44.680 --> 00:54:46.820
and drinking it like
Gatorade, and how

00:54:46.820 --> 00:54:52.490
that can extend lifespan in
rats, in different species.

00:54:52.490 --> 00:54:56.474
Other things I would
consider would--

00:54:56.474 --> 00:54:58.640
if we're looking at pills,
because everybody asks me

00:54:58.640 --> 00:55:02.920
about this, I would
say the medication

00:55:02.920 --> 00:55:07.020
that has the most
support that I find

00:55:07.020 --> 00:55:10.510
compelling would be metformin
right now, Glucophage.

00:55:10.510 --> 00:55:12.110
So you could look up metformin.

00:55:12.110 --> 00:55:14.200
There are side effects.

00:55:14.200 --> 00:55:19.092
But I do know a lot of MDs who
are using it prophylactically

00:55:19.092 --> 00:55:20.550
to decrease the
likelihood of dying

00:55:20.550 --> 00:55:22.460
from a few different things.

00:55:22.460 --> 00:55:24.010
Those would be first to mind.

00:55:24.010 --> 00:55:25.176
JORDAN THIBODEAU: Excellent.

00:55:25.176 --> 00:55:27.950
TIM FERRISS: Don't drive a
car-- maybe number three.

00:55:27.950 --> 00:55:29.310
JORDAN THIBODEAU: Yeah.

00:55:29.310 --> 00:55:31.185
AUDIENCE: Quick question--
how did you manage

00:55:31.185 --> 00:55:32.400
to conquer your insomnia?

00:55:32.400 --> 00:55:36.870
And what's the delta from a
four-hour body to now mental

00:55:36.870 --> 00:55:38.160
interventions, physical ones?

00:55:38.160 --> 00:55:39.993
And especially when it
comes to mental ones,

00:55:39.993 --> 00:55:42.480
how did you figure out or
how could one figure out

00:55:42.480 --> 00:55:44.610
what is keeping
them awake at night

00:55:44.610 --> 00:55:47.095
or what makes their
sleep quality poor?

00:55:47.095 --> 00:55:48.220
TIM FERRISS: Good question.

00:55:48.220 --> 00:55:51.230
So insomnia-- what has
helped me the most-- there

00:55:51.230 --> 00:55:52.610
are a few things.

00:55:52.610 --> 00:55:55.090
I would say they're
the obvious ones.

00:55:55.090 --> 00:55:57.510
But sometimes, the
obvious are important.

00:55:57.510 --> 00:55:59.780
Let me address the
variable question first.

00:55:59.780 --> 00:56:03.580
So there are controlled
studies where

00:56:03.580 --> 00:56:05.540
you're looking for
a certain p-value

00:56:05.540 --> 00:56:08.060
and you're looking
for a certain power

00:56:08.060 --> 00:56:11.110
and you care a lot about
isolating variables.

00:56:11.110 --> 00:56:13.880
If you care about results,
first and foremost,

00:56:13.880 --> 00:56:16.420
you can still identify what
the primary movers are.

00:56:16.420 --> 00:56:17.810
But I'll do it after the fact.

00:56:17.810 --> 00:56:18.760
What I mean by
that is right now,

00:56:18.760 --> 00:56:20.760
I have extreme elbow
tendinitis-- I actually

00:56:20.760 --> 00:56:22.550
have fixed most
of it, but that's

00:56:22.550 --> 00:56:24.130
a whole separate conversation.

00:56:24.130 --> 00:56:28.360
And I did it by throwing maybe
six variables at it at a time.

00:56:28.360 --> 00:56:29.890
And I do six at a time.

00:56:29.890 --> 00:56:33.166
And then if it
helped, I could then--

00:56:33.166 --> 00:56:35.290
because I cared first and
foremost about training--

00:56:35.290 --> 00:56:40.640
I could remove variables and
see what the impact reversal

00:56:40.640 --> 00:56:41.840
effects, et cetera, was.

00:56:41.840 --> 00:56:44.950
So generally, I'm throwing
quite a bit at the problem

00:56:44.950 --> 00:56:49.340
and then removing variables once
I have a winning combination.

00:56:49.340 --> 00:56:57.376
For me, with insomnia, it was
replacing coffee with tea.

00:56:57.376 --> 00:56:59.000
You can go with pretty
high-powered tea

00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:02.330
or you can start with
decaf tea and actually take

00:57:02.330 --> 00:57:05.972
like a Vivarin, caffeine
pill, cut it into quarters.

00:57:05.972 --> 00:57:07.930
So now you have, let's
just say hypothetically,

00:57:07.930 --> 00:57:10.060
25 milligrams a quarter.

00:57:10.060 --> 00:57:13.460
And you can start decreasing
your caffeine intake

00:57:13.460 --> 00:57:15.980
as a known quantity as
opposed to a cup of coffee

00:57:15.980 --> 00:57:18.340
because it's highly,
highly variant.

00:57:18.340 --> 00:57:22.771
So you can have decaf plus
100 milligrams first day.

00:57:22.771 --> 00:57:24.270
And then you do
that for three days.

00:57:24.270 --> 00:57:27.100
Next, you go to 75
milligrams, 50, 25.

00:57:27.100 --> 00:57:31.040
That's one of the more effective
ways to decaf yourself.

00:57:31.040 --> 00:57:34.570
That was one-- is then
limiting caffeine consumption

00:57:34.570 --> 00:57:35.580
past about 5:00 PM.

00:57:35.580 --> 00:57:37.420
But everybody's
heard that stuff.

00:57:37.420 --> 00:57:40.930
Two that I found
tremendously impactful

00:57:40.930 --> 00:57:44.120
that I did test in
isolation would be one,

00:57:44.120 --> 00:57:49.361
some type of meditation in
the morning-- so 20 minutes,

00:57:49.361 --> 00:57:49.860
let's say.

00:57:49.860 --> 00:57:50.860
You could start with 10.

00:57:50.860 --> 00:57:53.750
Use an app like Headspace,
which has been very

00:57:53.750 --> 00:57:56.080
popular with a lot of my fans.

00:57:56.080 --> 00:57:58.850
Meditation in the
morning depends a lot

00:57:58.850 --> 00:58:00.109
on your cause of insomnia.

00:58:00.109 --> 00:58:01.400
For me, it was the monkey mind.

00:58:01.400 --> 00:58:02.880
It was just the machinery.

00:58:02.880 --> 00:58:06.470
I couldn't get the cogs and
the wheels to stop moving.

00:58:06.470 --> 00:58:08.510
I was still in
problem-solving mode.

00:58:08.510 --> 00:58:13.480
Meditation in the morning,
reading fiction before bed

00:58:13.480 --> 00:58:17.710
to take you into a storytelling
or story-consuming as opposed

00:58:17.710 --> 00:58:23.790
to problem-solving mode, using
Flux or something like Flux

00:58:23.790 --> 00:58:29.390
to change the light emitted
from your laptop or screen.

00:58:29.390 --> 00:58:36.700
And last, I will-- how should
I do this-- a friend of mine

00:58:36.700 --> 00:58:39.980
found microdosing with
psychedelics to be very

00:58:39.980 --> 00:58:46.170
helpful in a
subhallucinogenic level

00:58:46.170 --> 00:58:50.732
with perhaps psilocybin or
something along those lines.

00:58:50.732 --> 00:58:53.440
I did a podcast
with James Fadiman--

00:58:53.440 --> 00:58:55.910
talked a lot about this.

00:58:55.910 --> 00:58:57.930
God forbid you think
I'm suggesting that.

00:58:57.930 --> 00:59:01.440
I would never--
highly irresponsible.

00:59:01.440 --> 00:59:03.720
But I don't make the news.

00:59:03.720 --> 00:59:05.470
I just report the news.

00:59:05.470 --> 00:59:08.260
[LAUGHTER]

00:59:08.260 --> 00:59:10.880
JORDAN THIBODEAU: We're going
to do another online question.

00:59:10.880 --> 00:59:12.630
You are known to be
an aggressive marketer

00:59:12.630 --> 00:59:14.080
for "The 4-Hour Workweek."

00:59:14.080 --> 00:59:21.143
How does 2016 Tim react to
2007 Tim's pitch and asks?

00:59:21.143 --> 00:59:22.642
TIM FERRISS: That's
a good question.

00:59:27.830 --> 00:59:29.550
2007 Tim?

00:59:29.550 --> 00:59:35.700
2007 Tim was-- I
think he was tolerable

00:59:35.700 --> 00:59:40.450
and for the-- probably
pushed a little too hard.

00:59:40.450 --> 00:59:45.410
What he didn't know and
he couldn't have known

00:59:45.410 --> 00:59:51.460
is really what really busy
actually means at a high level.

00:59:51.460 --> 00:59:55.140
So I would, for instance,
shoot off an email to someone

00:59:55.140 --> 00:59:59.810
to try to get them to look at
a 10-minute excerpt of the book

00:59:59.810 --> 01:00:01.340
that I took ages
to put together.

01:00:01.340 --> 01:00:02.920
And it's like this will
only take 10 minutes.

01:00:02.920 --> 01:00:04.495
And then they would reply with,
like, I don't have the time.

01:00:04.495 --> 01:00:06.962
And I'm like, how-- I didn't
say this, but in my head,

01:00:06.962 --> 01:00:08.920
I'm just like, how can
you not have 10 minutes?

01:00:08.920 --> 01:00:10.080
That's ridiculous.

01:00:10.080 --> 01:00:12.880
And get very offended.

01:00:12.880 --> 01:00:14.250
And now I get it.

01:00:14.250 --> 01:00:15.080
Now I get it.

01:00:15.080 --> 01:00:16.220
I get 1,500 email a day.

01:00:16.220 --> 01:00:20.600
I get probably 100 unsolicited
books sent to me a week--

01:00:20.600 --> 01:00:21.260
a week.

01:00:21.260 --> 01:00:22.520
I took a photograph
of it at one point.

01:00:22.520 --> 01:00:23.240
I took a stack.

01:00:23.240 --> 01:00:25.310
And I'm just like if I
don't get back to you,

01:00:25.310 --> 01:00:28.360
here's one reason
of probably 100 why.

01:00:28.360 --> 01:00:34.202
And now I have much more
empathy and compassion

01:00:34.202 --> 01:00:35.160
for that kind of thing.

01:00:35.160 --> 01:00:39.660
So it's like if somebody doesn't
get back to me for months,

01:00:39.660 --> 01:00:41.960
never attribute-- this is
another quote I find very

01:00:41.960 --> 01:00:43.680
useful-- never
attribute to malice

01:00:43.680 --> 01:00:45.770
what you can attribute
to incompetence.

01:00:45.770 --> 01:00:48.250
But I would add to that,
never attribute to malice

01:00:48.250 --> 01:00:53.780
what you can attribute to
incompetence or business.

01:00:53.780 --> 01:00:55.030
Try not to take it personally.

01:00:55.030 --> 01:00:57.892
Assume it's not personal.

01:00:57.892 --> 01:01:00.100
Give yourself the benefit
of the doubt because you're

01:01:00.100 --> 01:01:02.740
going to be the one who
takes the imaginary shrapnel

01:01:02.740 --> 01:01:07.096
and carries it around with you
like acid in a vessel for weeks

01:01:07.096 --> 01:01:08.220
on end if you hold grudges.

01:01:08.220 --> 01:01:12.930
So I think he did
a pretty good job,

01:01:12.930 --> 01:01:17.170
but could definitely be a
little overbearing at points.

01:01:17.170 --> 01:01:19.370
But I don't know if that's
something I would change.

01:01:19.370 --> 01:01:20.290
I don't know.

01:01:20.290 --> 01:01:22.670
I'm too maybe
superstitious to think

01:01:22.670 --> 01:01:27.270
that that would be-- I'm pretty
happy with how things worked

01:01:27.270 --> 01:01:27.770
out.

01:01:27.770 --> 01:01:29.780
So I'm not sure I would
have changed anything.

01:01:29.780 --> 01:01:32.820
But I would have told
him to be a little nicer

01:01:32.820 --> 01:01:35.810
to his joints-- very
aggressive with joints

01:01:35.810 --> 01:01:38.460
and have suffered a
lot of pain and surgery

01:01:38.460 --> 01:01:39.450
as a result of that.

01:01:39.450 --> 01:01:41.510
That's about it.

01:01:41.510 --> 01:01:42.500
AUDIENCE: Hi, Tim.

01:01:42.500 --> 01:01:46.000
I have a question around
the experiments and projects

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.470
that you lead and
do on your own.

01:01:48.470 --> 01:01:49.880
I'm wondering about vision.

01:01:49.880 --> 01:01:51.610
So you may not have
a five-year plan.

01:01:51.610 --> 01:01:53.640
But what is the
vision towards what

01:01:53.640 --> 01:01:57.330
you orient towards on
your day-to-basis basis?

01:01:57.330 --> 01:02:00.220
In terms of moment by
moment, who are you becoming?

01:02:00.220 --> 01:02:02.870
And I'm wondering what would
that look like for you?

01:02:02.870 --> 01:02:03.850
What's that vision?

01:02:03.850 --> 01:02:06.540
TIM FERRISS: Yeah.

01:02:06.540 --> 01:02:09.930
Vision for me is a tricky
one unless I take it really

01:02:09.930 --> 01:02:14.300
literally-- and it's like
in the "Dances with Wolves"

01:02:14.300 --> 01:02:18.254
sweat lodge kind of
sense, which that's also

01:02:18.254 --> 01:02:19.670
maybe a conversation
that requires

01:02:19.670 --> 01:02:21.230
some level of other substances.

01:02:21.230 --> 01:02:25.270
But in terms of who
I would like to be,

01:02:25.270 --> 01:02:27.990
I saw this-- it's so cheesy--
and I have a better answer,

01:02:27.990 --> 01:02:29.960
but I'll put it out
there anyway because I

01:02:29.960 --> 01:02:32.000
do think about it
with Molly, as-- I saw

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:33.280
this billboard at one point.

01:02:33.280 --> 01:02:35.550
It said be the person
your dog thinks you are.

01:02:35.550 --> 01:02:39.620
And I was just like, that's
actually really good advice.

01:02:39.620 --> 01:02:41.550
That's actually really,
really profound advice

01:02:41.550 --> 01:02:43.820
if you kind of think about it.

01:02:43.820 --> 01:02:52.390
But the vision I
think would be--

01:02:52.390 --> 01:02:53.840
let me try to back into this.

01:02:53.840 --> 01:02:57.090
So why build the podcast?

01:02:57.090 --> 01:02:58.370
Why?

01:02:58.370 --> 01:03:01.000
Why put out more books?

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:02.650
Why do these various things?

01:03:02.650 --> 01:03:04.230
Why focus, again, on editorial?

01:03:04.230 --> 01:03:06.930
I'm backing out of the
startups, focusing more

01:03:06.930 --> 01:03:10.260
on the creation and the
interviewing and the research.

01:03:10.260 --> 01:03:15.130
And I feel like that
is my Archimedes lever

01:03:15.130 --> 01:03:17.110
for larger change.

01:03:17.110 --> 01:03:20.760
And to give a precise example,
I've spent a lot of time

01:03:20.760 --> 01:03:22.730
around lawmakers
and politicians.

01:03:22.730 --> 01:03:24.340
I can't play that game.

01:03:24.340 --> 01:03:26.520
I have too many skeletons
outside of my closet,

01:03:26.520 --> 01:03:28.110
too many in my closet.

01:03:28.110 --> 01:03:31.120
I use way too many drugs.

01:03:31.120 --> 01:03:35.490
And I'm not good
at lying, which is

01:03:35.490 --> 01:03:39.430
sort of a prerequisite for
that form of theater, at least

01:03:39.430 --> 01:03:40.980
part of the time.

01:03:40.980 --> 01:03:45.330
But what I've realized is if I
have a very well-educated, very

01:03:45.330 --> 01:03:51.100
well-heeled, in some cases
influential audience,

01:03:51.100 --> 01:03:56.010
I can help steer that ship from
afar, kind of like a football

01:03:56.010 --> 01:03:58.230
coach calling commands
without actually having

01:03:58.230 --> 01:03:59.800
to have my hands on the wheel.

01:03:59.800 --> 01:04:01.610
I can influence it.

01:04:01.610 --> 01:04:06.360
And I've used that already
to affect certain things,

01:04:06.360 --> 01:04:09.140
like the legality of
shark fin importation

01:04:09.140 --> 01:04:12.320
in a couple of
states in the US--

01:04:12.320 --> 01:04:15.620
in the process of funding
research into using,

01:04:15.620 --> 01:04:18.280
for instance,
psilocybin to address

01:04:18.280 --> 01:04:21.150
treatment-resistant
depression at Johns Hopkins.

01:04:21.150 --> 01:04:25.260
And those are experiments
that will ultimately

01:04:25.260 --> 01:04:28.300
lead me to probably
change or attempt

01:04:28.300 --> 01:04:31.740
to change laws and
policy because you can

01:04:31.740 --> 01:04:33.855
be a chess piece on the board.

01:04:33.855 --> 01:04:35.730
You can be the best
piece on the board, which

01:04:35.730 --> 01:04:36.896
is better than being a pawn.

01:04:36.896 --> 01:04:38.810
That's kind of where
we all start, I think.

01:04:38.810 --> 01:04:40.920
Then you can be a chess player.

01:04:40.920 --> 01:04:42.100
Then you can get very good.

01:04:42.100 --> 01:04:43.683
Then you can be the
person who designs

01:04:43.683 --> 01:04:45.230
the game in the first place.

01:04:45.230 --> 01:04:48.970
And ultimately, in
that sort of cascade,

01:04:48.970 --> 01:04:50.720
that's the most
powerful position.

01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:50.900
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:04:50.900 --> 01:04:51.920
And then you change the game.

01:04:51.920 --> 01:04:52.153
That's good.

01:04:52.153 --> 01:04:53.778
TIM FERRISS: Yeah,
you change the game.

01:04:53.778 --> 01:04:56.450
So I think that on a greatest
impact for the greatest

01:04:56.450 --> 01:04:59.000
number of people, I don't want
to lose the one-to-one, which

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.530
is why the podcast and providing
people with things they can

01:05:01.530 --> 01:05:04.740
start now, immediately start
using tomorrow or today,

01:05:04.740 --> 01:05:06.970
is important to me.

01:05:06.970 --> 01:05:08.120
That's the micro.

01:05:08.120 --> 01:05:09.220
That can affect the macro.

01:05:09.220 --> 01:05:11.220
But directly affecting
the chessboard

01:05:11.220 --> 01:05:13.000
is something I want to do.

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:16.600
But I'm playing a long game with
that because to do it right,

01:05:16.600 --> 01:05:19.590
I have to approach it
very, very methodically.

01:05:19.590 --> 01:05:25.110
For me personally, I think
the most important thing

01:05:25.110 --> 01:05:31.290
to me personally right
now is to be more--

01:05:31.290 --> 01:05:35.090
and I am much better, but to
reflect more on what-- like,

01:05:35.090 --> 01:05:39.230
to be happy with what I have
and to constantly reflect

01:05:39.230 --> 01:05:43.460
on how fortunate I
am in so many ways

01:05:43.460 --> 01:05:45.540
because if I don't do
that, nothing I get

01:05:45.540 --> 01:05:49.270
will ever make me happy,
content, fulfilled.

01:05:49.270 --> 01:05:51.350
And I'm really
good at achieving.

01:05:51.350 --> 01:05:53.050
I can knock down walls.

01:05:53.050 --> 01:05:54.240
I'm really good at it.

01:05:54.240 --> 01:05:57.090
But that is only one side.

01:05:57.090 --> 01:05:59.150
It's only one piece
of the whole equation.

01:05:59.150 --> 01:06:01.685
And on top of
that, I would say--

01:06:01.685 --> 01:06:07.760
and this is a twofer-- is
practicing and immersing

01:06:07.760 --> 01:06:10.220
myself, recognizing that
I'm a social animal-- humans

01:06:10.220 --> 01:06:14.750
are social animals-- so spending
a lot of time in groups.

01:06:14.750 --> 01:06:17.410
That means mixed groups,
meaning mixed gender.

01:06:17.410 --> 01:06:19.880
It also means, and this
is very out of favor

01:06:19.880 --> 01:06:25.350
as a topic of conversation--
like small groups of men for me

01:06:25.350 --> 01:06:27.700
and spending periods of
time in that environment.

01:06:27.700 --> 01:06:32.240
It's just I find
it inexplicably,

01:06:32.240 --> 01:06:33.830
in a way, therapeutic.

01:06:33.830 --> 01:06:37.280
And I think that if you look
at our evolutionary biology,

01:06:37.280 --> 01:06:40.550
you look at tribal societies--
my most recent podcast

01:06:40.550 --> 01:06:43.360
with Sebastian Junger gets
into this quite a bit-- we're

01:06:43.360 --> 01:06:45.761
in such a sensitive
political climate.

01:06:45.761 --> 01:06:48.010
I'm not telling you to run
around and touch everybody.

01:06:48.010 --> 01:06:51.940
But there's no physical contact.

01:06:51.940 --> 01:07:00.900
And it's extremely, I
think, problematic for us

01:07:00.900 --> 01:07:05.250
as organisms to live the
way we currently live.

01:07:05.250 --> 01:07:06.510
So I think I need that.

01:07:06.510 --> 01:07:10.770
And part and parcel of that is
developing greater compassion

01:07:10.770 --> 01:07:12.200
and empathy, or
just rediscovering

01:07:12.200 --> 01:07:13.850
that-- so long answer.

01:07:13.850 --> 01:07:14.600
I apologize, guys.

01:07:14.600 --> 01:07:16.980
But if I had to reflect
on it for me personally,

01:07:16.980 --> 01:07:17.897
that would be--

01:07:17.897 --> 01:07:18.730
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

01:07:18.730 --> 01:07:19.210
Thanks.

01:07:19.210 --> 01:07:19.240
It's good.

01:07:19.240 --> 01:07:20.720
JORDAN THIBODEAU: We'll
do one on online question

01:07:20.720 --> 01:07:22.261
and then one more
in-person question.

01:07:22.261 --> 01:07:24.870
So for the online
question, you've

01:07:24.870 --> 01:07:27.170
experimented with interview
structure of your podcast

01:07:27.170 --> 01:07:30.380
a few times-- sharing a bottle
of wine with Astro Teller.

01:07:30.380 --> 01:07:32.880
What has worked the best?

01:07:32.880 --> 01:07:38.400
TIM FERRISS: Interview
format-- I've tried many things

01:07:38.400 --> 01:07:39.360
in interview formats.

01:07:39.360 --> 01:07:41.609
I've also tried non-interview
formats for the podcast.

01:07:41.609 --> 01:07:45.110
And part of what is great
about treating things

01:07:45.110 --> 01:07:48.190
as an experiment and being very
vocal about the fact that you

01:07:48.190 --> 01:07:50.760
are doing that is
that you get hall

01:07:50.760 --> 01:07:54.020
passes to do all sorts of
zany, hair-brained shit, which

01:07:54.020 --> 01:07:54.580
is great.

01:07:54.580 --> 01:08:01.840
So I've done the
wine-- no big surprise.

01:08:01.840 --> 01:08:05.900
There's a tipping point
where wine makes you funnier

01:08:05.900 --> 01:08:08.300
and then you just feel like
you're getting funnier,

01:08:08.300 --> 01:08:10.110
but you're no longer funny.

01:08:10.110 --> 01:08:14.250
There's definitely a point where
the whole scale flips on that.

01:08:14.250 --> 01:08:16.340
But format-wise, what
I've found to work

01:08:16.340 --> 01:08:19.020
very well with my guests
is at least an hour

01:08:19.020 --> 01:08:20.604
and a half, up to three hours.

01:08:20.604 --> 01:08:22.020
Once you get to
three, most people

01:08:22.020 --> 01:08:24.189
just start running out of gas.

01:08:24.189 --> 01:08:27.710
I break the interview generally
in my mind into thirds.

01:08:27.710 --> 01:08:32.859
First third would be
developing rapport, offering

01:08:32.859 --> 01:08:34.167
vulnerabilities of my own.

01:08:34.167 --> 01:08:36.000
So if you hear me
offering stories of my own

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:37.020
in the beginning,
it's not because I

01:08:37.020 --> 01:08:38.180
want it to be the
Tim Ferriss show,

01:08:38.180 --> 01:08:39.380
even though it literally is.

01:08:39.380 --> 01:08:41.700
I don't want it to
be just me talking.

01:08:41.700 --> 01:08:44.242
I'm offering vulnerable pieces
so that they will reciprocate.

01:08:44.242 --> 01:08:46.283
And that's something I
learned from Neil Strauss.

01:08:46.283 --> 01:08:47.410
It works really well.

01:08:47.410 --> 01:08:50.210
So I'm trying to crack the ice.

01:08:50.210 --> 01:08:53.784
First third is basically getting
through some of their bio,

01:08:53.784 --> 01:08:56.200
or not getting through-- it's
interesting stuff-- covering

01:08:56.200 --> 01:09:00.020
some of their bio, current
projects, and breaking the ice,

01:09:00.020 --> 01:09:03.240
and also getting through
some of their soundbites.

01:09:03.240 --> 01:09:06.390
Second third would be audience
questions often times,

01:09:06.390 --> 01:09:08.290
or questions informed
by the audience.

01:09:08.290 --> 01:09:13.350
And then the tail end
of that second third

01:09:13.350 --> 01:09:15.979
is whatever they want to
pitch or talk about or promote

01:09:15.979 --> 01:09:17.189
if they have something.

01:09:17.189 --> 01:09:22.330
Then rapid-fire questions
and sort my usual set.

01:09:22.330 --> 01:09:24.270
And then the close.

01:09:24.270 --> 01:09:28.040
And I find that structure
works very well for me.

01:09:28.040 --> 01:09:31.210
In my experience, it
takes at least an hour--

01:09:31.210 --> 01:09:34.439
sometimes more-- unless you
know the person already to get

01:09:34.439 --> 01:09:36.550
through their usual shtick.

01:09:36.550 --> 01:09:38.840
And if you do a
lot of media, as I

01:09:38.840 --> 01:09:40.890
do-- I'm just as guilty
of this as anyone else--

01:09:40.890 --> 01:09:44.720
we talked about preserving your
decision-making creativity hit

01:09:44.720 --> 01:09:45.220
points.

01:09:45.220 --> 01:09:46.189
One of the ways
you do that is you

01:09:46.189 --> 01:09:48.149
figure out which stories
and answers work really well

01:09:48.149 --> 01:09:50.069
and you just use those
over and over again.

01:09:50.069 --> 01:09:51.810
But I want to get
original material.

01:09:51.810 --> 01:09:53.380
So you have to
burn through that.

01:09:53.380 --> 01:09:55.213
And it takes about an
hour, hour and a half.

01:09:57.300 --> 01:10:00.360
And that's the general format.

01:10:00.360 --> 01:10:03.700
There's a lot of prep that
goes into that, of course.

01:10:03.700 --> 01:10:05.650
Other formats that
work very well

01:10:05.650 --> 01:10:08.270
that I hadn't seen any other
podcast try-- but again,

01:10:08.270 --> 01:10:11.516
asking the question, what would
this look like if it were easy?

01:10:11.516 --> 01:10:12.890
I was like, man,
it's really hard

01:10:12.890 --> 01:10:13.980
to schedule with these people.

01:10:13.980 --> 01:10:15.521
These are really,
really busy people.

01:10:15.521 --> 01:10:16.690
It's super hard to schedule.

01:10:16.690 --> 01:10:20.340
What if I just had the
questions submitted and voted

01:10:20.340 --> 01:10:24.600
on Reddit or Facebook or
somewhere and then took

01:10:24.600 --> 01:10:27.460
the top 10, emailed
them, bought them

01:10:27.460 --> 01:10:31.510
a mic-- ATR2100's my favorite
kind of all-purpose mic,

01:10:31.510 --> 01:10:34.390
USB-- on Amazon Prime,
shipped it to them.

01:10:34.390 --> 01:10:35.640
It's just like, you know what?

01:10:35.640 --> 01:10:37.830
Record whatever you want.

01:10:37.830 --> 01:10:39.210
We don't have to
schedule a time.

01:10:39.210 --> 01:10:40.290
Just repeat the
question, the person

01:10:40.290 --> 01:10:41.915
who asked it, and
then give the answer.

01:10:41.915 --> 01:10:45.570
And some of those have turned
out spectacularly well.

01:10:45.570 --> 01:10:51.890
Maria Popova of "Brain
Pickings" killed it so good.

01:10:51.890 --> 01:10:55.290
Sam Harris killed
it just so, so good.

01:10:55.290 --> 01:10:58.000
Some of them are better
than others, of course.

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.060
But there are quite a few
formats that work well.

01:11:00.060 --> 01:11:01.760
I do like the wine.

01:11:01.760 --> 01:11:04.249
But I've realized you've
got to segue into the wine,

01:11:04.249 --> 01:11:05.790
like, halfway through
or you're going

01:11:05.790 --> 01:11:08.129
to be really sloppy for the end.

01:11:08.129 --> 01:11:09.670
So I think the Matt
Mullenweg episode

01:11:09.670 --> 01:11:11.290
that I did where
we started with tea

01:11:11.290 --> 01:11:14.480
and then segued to tequila,
for the second half,

01:11:14.480 --> 01:11:16.330
that was a good format.

01:11:16.330 --> 01:11:17.664
We didn't get too off the rails.

01:11:17.664 --> 01:11:19.080
JORDAN THIBODEAU:
Worked out well.

01:11:19.080 --> 01:11:21.740
AUDIENCE: In the many podcasts
and books that you've written,

01:11:21.740 --> 01:11:24.690
you've done a tremendous amount
of individual experiments,

01:11:24.690 --> 01:11:26.020
and so have your guests.

01:11:26.020 --> 01:11:30.010
But my question is let's
get back to your tribe

01:11:30.010 --> 01:11:31.880
here that you want.

01:11:31.880 --> 01:11:34.370
Let's say if you have a
bunch of adult followers

01:11:34.370 --> 01:11:36.830
and you want to
make your own tribe,

01:11:36.830 --> 01:11:39.310
what would you
basically have them do,

01:11:39.310 --> 01:11:41.750
whether it's for
their own betterment

01:11:41.750 --> 01:11:44.175
or for your own personal
experimentation?

01:11:44.175 --> 01:11:45.550
TIM FERRISS:
Meaning what would I

01:11:45.550 --> 01:11:47.690
have them do for
the greater good,

01:11:47.690 --> 01:11:50.659
or what would I have them do
to solidify their own tribe?

01:11:50.659 --> 01:11:52.450
AUDIENCE: I mean
actually, like, let's just

01:11:52.450 --> 01:11:54.342
say you have an adult
boot camp, you know?

01:11:54.342 --> 01:11:55.050
TIM FERRISS: Yep.

01:11:55.050 --> 01:11:56.550
AUDIENCE: You get
a group of people,

01:11:56.550 --> 01:11:58.206
however-- let's
just say, I don't

01:11:58.206 --> 01:12:00.810
know, 20 people or something
like that for 30 days.

01:12:00.810 --> 01:12:05.750
And I'm kind of wondering
would you run an experiment

01:12:05.750 --> 01:12:06.780
or would you--

01:12:06.780 --> 01:12:09.630
TIM FERRISS: If I wanted them
to be as tight as possible?

01:12:09.630 --> 01:12:12.040
If I wanted them to
be as tightly bonded?

01:12:12.040 --> 01:12:14.040
AUDIENCE: Actually, that's
part of the question.

01:12:14.040 --> 01:12:15.789
I guess what would
your goal be, because

01:12:15.789 --> 01:12:17.330
like I said, for
their own betterment

01:12:17.330 --> 01:12:19.170
or for your own experimentation?

01:12:19.170 --> 01:12:19.920
TIM FERRISS: Yeah.

01:12:19.920 --> 01:12:26.076
If I had an adult boot camp with
20 people, I would have equal--

01:12:26.076 --> 01:12:28.000
and this might come
off the wrong way--

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:31.590
but either equal numbers of
men and women, or just men.

01:12:31.590 --> 01:12:34.410
And I would find someone
who's in my position who's

01:12:34.410 --> 01:12:40.020
female to lead the equivalent
for women because I would like

01:12:40.020 --> 01:12:41.520
to think I have
empathy, but I don't

01:12:41.520 --> 01:12:43.712
have enough empathy
to understand

01:12:43.712 --> 01:12:44.920
what it's like to be a woman.

01:12:44.920 --> 01:12:47.750
I'm not a woman, last I checked.

01:12:47.750 --> 01:12:50.440
So it could be
split, in which case

01:12:50.440 --> 01:12:52.710
there'll be together
activities, but also

01:12:52.710 --> 01:12:55.019
sort of gender-specific--
not gender-specific.

01:12:55.019 --> 01:12:56.560
They'd be doing the
exact same thing.

01:12:56.560 --> 01:13:01.290
They would just be
in different groups.

01:13:01.290 --> 01:13:06.720
And the activities-- so
I wouldn't have a goal.

01:13:06.720 --> 01:13:08.782
It wouldn't be like "Fight
Club" Operation Mayhem

01:13:08.782 --> 01:13:09.740
at the end or anything.

01:13:09.740 --> 01:13:16.210
I wouldn't have a single thing
for them to do afterwards.

01:13:16.210 --> 01:13:19.380
Potentially-- actually,
I take that back.

01:13:19.380 --> 01:13:21.396
There would be a lot of
hardship and suffering.

01:13:21.396 --> 01:13:23.190
[LAUGHTER]

01:13:23.190 --> 01:13:25.720
No, I'm serious.

01:13:25.720 --> 01:13:28.374
There's too little productive
suffering in the US right now.

01:13:28.374 --> 01:13:30.790
And it's like, oh, you got
27th place, here's a gold star.

01:13:30.790 --> 01:13:32.580
No, that does not help anyone.

01:13:32.580 --> 01:13:33.780
It really doesn't.

01:13:33.780 --> 01:13:36.860
So getting good at
failing and overcoming it

01:13:36.860 --> 01:13:38.860
and coming back from it--
that's the real world.

01:13:38.860 --> 01:13:40.550
That's what I want
to train people

01:13:40.550 --> 01:13:43.620
to be able to handle because
if they're used to fighting

01:13:43.620 --> 01:13:45.400
each other in those
big blowup sumo suits

01:13:45.400 --> 01:13:48.475
and they're like I'm awesome and
they go out and then get round

01:13:48.475 --> 01:13:50.200
kicked in the head
by a UFC fighter,

01:13:50.200 --> 01:13:52.320
they're just going to be like,
what the fuck just happened?

01:13:52.320 --> 01:13:53.300
They won't be able
to recover from it.

01:13:53.300 --> 01:13:55.100
So I would have
probably some element

01:13:55.100 --> 01:13:57.930
of fasting because
most people are not

01:13:57.930 --> 01:14:02.620
familiar with the true
sensation of being hungry.

01:14:02.620 --> 01:14:08.680
I wasn't for decades-- really
hungry, not like, oh my god,

01:14:08.680 --> 01:14:10.400
I'm grumpy, I'm
hangry, I haven't

01:14:10.400 --> 01:14:12.080
had cashews in four hours.

01:14:12.080 --> 01:14:15.710
No, like really hungry,
like you haven't

01:14:15.710 --> 01:14:19.040
eaten in three days hungry.

01:14:19.040 --> 01:14:21.600
And there would be an
element of fasting.

01:14:21.600 --> 01:14:24.170
There would be an element of
physical discomfort or pain.

01:14:24.170 --> 01:14:27.230
I'd probably have people
doing outdoor activities

01:14:27.230 --> 01:14:29.600
like building debris
huts or something like

01:14:29.600 --> 01:14:36.580
that-- no screens
whatsoever, no alarm clocks.

01:14:36.580 --> 01:14:39.390
So for the first few days,
people would come in, decaf.

01:14:39.390 --> 01:14:41.540
They would be titrating
off of caffeine.

01:14:41.540 --> 01:14:43.672
And they would wake up
whenever they woke up,

01:14:43.672 --> 01:14:45.880
like for the first time
maybe getting the actual rest

01:14:45.880 --> 01:14:48.670
that they need in 10 years.

01:14:48.670 --> 01:14:54.739
And I would spend
a lot of the time--

01:14:54.739 --> 01:14:56.530
and this is straight
from Sebastian Junger.

01:14:56.530 --> 01:14:57.490
I think he was talking
about what he would

01:14:57.490 --> 01:14:59.020
do in ninth or 10th grade.

01:14:59.020 --> 01:15:02.570
I would have people working on
projects, like small projects

01:15:02.570 --> 01:15:04.350
that were very difficult.

01:15:04.350 --> 01:15:10.330
And we would rotate in terms of
who was leading a given group.

01:15:10.330 --> 01:15:12.660
So let's just say-- they'd
be small groups, maybe

01:15:12.660 --> 01:15:15.450
like five groups of four.

01:15:15.450 --> 01:15:17.000
Everybody would
have an opportunity

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.120
to sort of lead a project.

01:15:19.120 --> 01:15:23.950
And it would not be
totally democratic at all.

01:15:23.950 --> 01:15:29.220
I'd be like, OK, 1, 2, 3,
4, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4.

01:15:29.220 --> 01:15:30.340
OK, ones, raise your hand.

01:15:30.340 --> 01:15:31.800
OK, you're the dictators.

01:15:31.800 --> 01:15:32.380
That's it.

01:15:32.380 --> 01:15:34.129
Everybody has to do
exactly what you said.

01:15:34.129 --> 01:15:37.500
This is not a flat organization.

01:15:37.500 --> 01:15:38.030
No.

01:15:38.030 --> 01:15:40.510
You are like the platoon leader.

01:15:40.510 --> 01:15:42.650
That's it-- or maybe
not the best analogy.

01:15:42.650 --> 01:15:44.000
You're the dictator.

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:48.760
And every exercise would be
intended to put people out

01:15:48.760 --> 01:15:51.100
of their comfort
zone physically,

01:15:51.100 --> 01:15:57.930
emotionally,
psychologically, mentally so

01:15:57.930 --> 01:16:00.700
that when they come
out the other end,

01:16:00.700 --> 01:16:02.950
they are better at-- this
is probably the only part

01:16:02.950 --> 01:16:05.315
that I might teach because
we'd do postmortems

01:16:05.315 --> 01:16:08.310
on all of these-- would be
the ability to learn quickly

01:16:08.310 --> 01:16:11.650
and the ability to
teach other people.

01:16:11.650 --> 01:16:13.690
And my goal all
along in a way has

01:16:13.690 --> 01:16:16.140
been to create a
benevolent army of people

01:16:16.140 --> 01:16:23.700
who are expert learners--
incredibly high-level, top 1%

01:16:23.700 --> 01:16:28.192
meta learners who can learn to
be better at anything I've done

01:16:28.192 --> 01:16:29.900
who can then teach
people, in turn, to be

01:16:29.900 --> 01:16:31.627
better than they are.

01:16:31.627 --> 01:16:32.960
That seems like the right trend.

01:16:32.960 --> 01:16:35.700
So I think that's-- I've
actually fantasized about this,

01:16:35.700 --> 01:16:37.179
like adult boot camp thing.

01:16:37.179 --> 01:16:38.220
AUDIENCE: Haven't we all?

01:16:38.220 --> 01:16:40.053
TIM FERRISS: I've
fantasized about it a lot.

01:16:40.053 --> 01:16:42.510
But it would just
be like camp pain.

01:16:42.510 --> 01:16:46.210
It would just be
like-- but you look

01:16:46.210 --> 01:16:48.350
at the successful like
Tough Mudder Spartan race.

01:16:48.350 --> 01:16:50.599
There's actually a good doc
coming out soon-- I really

01:16:50.599 --> 01:16:53.870
enjoyed it, I know the guy
who produced it-- called

01:16:53.870 --> 01:16:56.110
the "Rise of the Sufferfests."

01:16:56.110 --> 01:17:01.530
I think there's part of us that
really subconsciously yearns

01:17:01.530 --> 01:17:03.560
to be tested.

01:17:03.560 --> 01:17:08.700
Nobody's really tested these
days in a holistic way,

01:17:08.700 --> 01:17:10.380
like a really painful way.

01:17:10.380 --> 01:17:12.250
There's no rite of passage.

01:17:12.250 --> 01:17:15.660
But I think we're programmed
to need that, to want that.

01:17:15.660 --> 01:17:21.160
So I think the camp might
get pretty low reviews given

01:17:21.160 --> 01:17:22.980
the amount of pain involved.

01:17:22.980 --> 01:17:26.460
Or I'd just have a religious
following of masochists.

01:17:26.460 --> 01:17:27.510
I don't know.

01:17:27.510 --> 01:17:30.120
But I do fantasize about it.

01:17:30.120 --> 01:17:32.700
But the goal would be
master meta learners

01:17:32.700 --> 01:17:34.740
who have a high pain
tolerance, who've

01:17:34.740 --> 01:17:36.909
expanded their sphere
of comfortable action,

01:17:36.909 --> 01:17:38.950
and are really good at
helping other people to do

01:17:38.950 --> 01:17:39.910
the same thing.

01:17:39.910 --> 01:17:40.460
JORDAN THIBODEAU:
Well, Tim, thank

01:17:40.460 --> 01:17:42.310
you very much for coming
and speaking to us--

01:17:42.310 --> 01:17:42.610
really appreciate it.

01:17:42.610 --> 01:17:42.910
TIM FERRISS: Yeah.

01:17:42.910 --> 01:17:43.810
My pleasure.

01:17:43.810 --> 01:17:46.860
