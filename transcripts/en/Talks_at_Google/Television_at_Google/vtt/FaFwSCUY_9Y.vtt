00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.185
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:10.180
SHILPA MANIAR: So, Hudson, it's
a pleasure to have you here.

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:12.320
So if you guys don't
know, Hudson is actually

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:16.460
22 years old, and he is
age appropriate to date

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:17.690
for all the girls out there.

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:18.900
HUDSON YANG: Ha, ha, ha.

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.300
SHILPA MANIAR: Is that OK, mom?

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:21.920
Just kidding.

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:25.470
So Hudson is 11 years old.

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.980
What a great accomplishment,
Hudson, at 11

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.260
to be the lead actor on
"Fresh Off the Boat."

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.200
So I think it's
only appropriate,

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.170
because the episode was
about basketball-- who is

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:38.340
your favorite basketball star?

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.894
HUDSON YANG: Well, my favorite
is Jeremy Lin, obviously.

00:00:42.894 --> 00:00:44.560
SHILPA MANIAR: Are
you paid to say that?

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:44.820
HUDSON YANG: Huh?

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.040
SHILPA MANIAR: Are
you paid to say that?

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.706
HUDSON YANG: No.

00:00:46.706 --> 00:00:47.206
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:47.206 --> 00:00:48.122
SHILPA MANIAR: Oh, OK.

00:00:48.122 --> 00:00:49.890
VINA HA: Have you
ever met Jeremy Lin?

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.730
HUDSON YANG: I was going
to, like a few days ago,

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:57.364
except I had to fly out to
LA because he's a Laker.

00:00:57.364 --> 00:00:58.280
So I couldn't make it.

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.090
VINA HA: So I
noticed that there's

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:10.080
a special guest appearance of
your father in this episode.

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.600
Can you tell us who's a better
actor, you or your father?

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.910
HUDSON YANG: That's a tough one.

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:20.290
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:21.062
For him.

00:01:21.062 --> 00:01:22.510
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:24.880
Just kidding.

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:26.126
I can't answer that.

00:01:26.126 --> 00:01:26.950
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:28.775
VINA HA: All good, all good.

00:01:28.775 --> 00:01:31.150
SHILPA MANIAR: So I think it
was only appropriate to ask,

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:34.630
because you are at Google
today, and everyone

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:38.200
says Google knows
everything about everyone.

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.520
So what is the most
interesting thing

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.130
you've ever googled
about yourself?

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.610
HUDSON YANG: I haven't really
googled about myself, really.

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.230
SHILPA MANIAR: What's your
favorite thing to Google?

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:51.122
HUDSON YANG: YouTube.

00:01:51.122 --> 00:01:53.840
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.877
VINA HA: Awesome, because
Google owns YouTube.

00:01:55.877 --> 00:01:57.370
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:58.678
That's the right answer.

00:01:58.678 --> 00:02:00.404
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:00.404 --> 00:02:02.070
SHILPA MANIAR: Is
there a specific video

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.290
you like to watch on YouTube?

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:04.706
HUDSON YANG: Well,
as my mom said,

00:02:04.706 --> 00:02:08.500
Minecraft or sometimes tips
for like games and stuff.

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:15.011
VINA HA: So I'm a
big fan of the show,

00:02:15.011 --> 00:02:17.510
and when I talk to my friends
who are also fans of the show,

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.330
they always talk about
how great you are.

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.200
And a lot of my friends
say like, oh, he's so cute,

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.815
he's so adorable.

00:02:23.815 --> 00:02:25.190
Now that we're
like getting close

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:26.910
to the end of the
season-- this I think

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.170
was the second-to-last
episode of the season--

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.160
how have the last few months
totally changed your life?

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.670
How does it feel
to be a celebrity?

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:37.784
HUDSON YANG: I mean, I don't
think of myself as a celebrity.

00:02:37.784 --> 00:02:39.450
I think of myself as
a well-known child.

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.940
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:44.454
VINA HA: That is
the best answer you

00:02:44.454 --> 00:02:45.662
could give for that question.

00:02:45.662 --> 00:02:48.190
HUDSON YANG: But I mean,
the last few months

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:50.550
have been extremely different.

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:54.050
I mean, I've been
stopped on the street,

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:57.090
and people have been
taking pictures with me.

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:58.980
And everybody's
just been like kind

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.650
of congratulating
me all the time,

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.140
saying the show's amazing.

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.430
But I mean, my
friends and everybody,

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:09.900
like those kind
of people, they've

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.030
been treating me the same.

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:12.330
They're just proud.

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:14.240
And they're like happy.

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:18.300
And they're like really
excited for the show

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:20.464
all the time, yeah.

00:03:20.464 --> 00:03:22.380
SHILPA MANIAR: So I guess
that's a good segue.

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:24.870
So how does it feel
going to school?

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.110
Because you just came
from school today, right?

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.520
HUDSON YANG: Yeah.

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:28.430
SHILPA MANIAR: So how
does it feel when you

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:30.050
go to school after the show.

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:31.040
Do you feel different?

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.060
Do teachers treat
you differently?

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:34.060
HUDSON YANG: Not really.

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:37.120
I mean, they've asked about
it like once or twice.

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:38.810
But they don't treat
me differently.

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:41.351
It's a job to be equal, really.

00:03:41.351 --> 00:03:41.850
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:44.960
SHILPA MANIAR: So you
don't get a free pass,

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:48.190
extra credit for being super
amazing and talented on "Fresh

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:48.860
Off the Boat?"

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:50.649
It's not an extra 10
points on an exam?

00:03:50.649 --> 00:03:51.815
HUDSON YANG: I wish, but no.

00:03:51.815 --> 00:03:54.305
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:54.305 --> 00:03:56.430
VINA HA: So, one of the
great things about the show

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:58.410
is that it deals with
Asian American issues.

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:00.320
That's like a big
theme of the show.

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:03.020
And there were a
couple episodes--

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:06.210
there was one episode where
your character Eddie was called

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:07.950
a "chink" by another classmate.

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:12.627
There's another episode where
a bunch of students at lunch

00:04:12.627 --> 00:04:15.210
complained about the smelly food
that your mom packed for you,

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:17.230
and that's why
you asked your mom

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:19.490
to get you some Lunchables
so that it doesn't smell up

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:21.620
the lunch room.

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:24.967
So just being part of the
show, what kind of lessons

00:04:24.967 --> 00:04:26.800
have you learned about
being Asian American?

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:28.820
And what other issues
have you learned about

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:30.180
by just being part of the show?

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:32.620
HUDSON YANG: I mean, I've
known about a few of them,

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:34.960
like how people like
don't adjust to your food

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:38.790
right away or about
how there's like upset

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:43.950
and like not nice names that
people call different races.

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:47.830
But I mean, I didn't
know that word before.

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:50.340
And there's like other
things where it's like,

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:53.860
people nowadays at my school,
they weren't that like harsh

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:56.210
and they weren't as like
cruel and they didn't

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:58.180
call me names or anything.

00:04:58.180 --> 00:04:59.820
They just kind of
asked questions.

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:03.240
That were polite, like
politely, like straight up.

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:09.630
SHILPA MANIAR: You have a
tough role to fill, I think,

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:11.760
for the Asian American
society at 11.

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:15.340
So we really appreciate
what you're doing out there.

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:16.690
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:19.007
That was a serious anecdote.

00:05:19.007 --> 00:05:20.215
HUDSON YANG: What's so funny?

00:05:20.215 --> 00:05:23.610
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:27.025
SHILPA MANIAR: [LAUGHS]
So you don't even

00:05:27.025 --> 00:05:29.320
have to say anything and
everyone laughs at you.

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:30.862
I wish that was
something I could do.

00:05:30.862 --> 00:05:32.569
You're going to have
to teach me one day.

00:05:32.569 --> 00:05:33.710
HUDSON YANG: [LAUGHS]

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:35.623
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:35.623 --> 00:05:37.830
SHILPA MANIAR: OK.

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:42.170
So, we talk about these
big shoes you have to fill.

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:44.960
And we've been
reading, and we know

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:47.960
that the last time an Asian
American show was on the air

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:49.807
was about 20 years ago.

00:05:49.807 --> 00:05:51.640
I think that was called
"All-American Girl,"

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:54.750
for those of you who might
have watched it before.

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:57.370
And you're not
even 20 years old.

00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:01.200
So how does that pressure
feel for you having to live up

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:03.002
to such high expectations?

00:06:03.002 --> 00:06:04.460
HUDSON YANG: I
mean, I don't really

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:06.670
think about the
expectations like people

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:09.526
have on me or something
or how like Asians think

00:06:09.526 --> 00:06:11.150
if this messes up
they're going to have

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:13.524
to wait another 20 years until
the next one or something.

00:06:13.524 --> 00:06:16.300
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:17.710
This is just an
experience that I

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:21.620
want to go through, have
fun with, and just make it

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:24.920
last as long as I can.

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:27.840
SHILPA MANIAR: We're
supportive of you.

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:30.260
VINA HA: OK, so we're going
to switch over to some Dory

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:31.550
and live questions.

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:33.550
So we'll take the
first Dory question.

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:36.330
Hudson, what would it take to
be cast as your long-lost cousin

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:36.910
on the show?

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:40.380
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:42.840
HUDSON YANG: I
actually have no idea.

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:44.820
There have been like
one of the episodes

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:48.010
where, like, my cousins
came, but long-lost cousin?

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:49.100
I don't know.

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:51.354
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:51.354 --> 00:06:52.020
VINA HA: Got it.

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:54.400
We'll send the bad news to
Roger, who asked the question.

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:55.275
HUDSON YANG: [LAUGHS]

00:06:55.275 --> 00:06:56.450
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:56.450 --> 00:06:58.350
VINA HA: If there are
any live questions,

00:06:58.350 --> 00:07:00.310
we have mikes set
up, so please line

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:06.160
up so that we can capture your
question on the recording.

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:07.659
We have one live right there.

00:07:07.659 --> 00:07:08.118
AUDIENCE: Hey, Hudson.

00:07:08.118 --> 00:07:08.742
How's it going?

00:07:08.742 --> 00:07:10.872
Thank you so much for
coming out tonight.

00:07:10.872 --> 00:07:13.410
One of my questions for
you-- if you could guest

00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:16.000
appear on any show in
the world right now,

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.624
what show would that be for you?

00:07:17.624 --> 00:07:18.540
HUDSON YANG: Any show?

00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:19.230
AUDIENCE: Any show.

00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:20.063
HUDSON YANG: At all?

00:07:20.063 --> 00:07:22.660
AUDIENCE: Yup, any show at all.

00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:24.250
HUDSON YANG: "Modern Family."

00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:26.720
AUDIENCE: That's a great choice.

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:27.409
Great choice.

00:07:27.409 --> 00:07:28.325
Thanks for coming out.

00:07:28.325 --> 00:07:31.230
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:32.829
VINA HA: Any other live?

00:07:32.829 --> 00:07:34.370
If there are no
other live questions,

00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:35.411
we'll take the next Dory.

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:40.430
SHILPA MANIAR: So the
next question is, hi

00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:42.200
all the way from Shanghai.

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:44.180
I'm a big fan of your show.

00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:46.190
If you could name
the top three things

00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:50.270
from the show that really rang
true for you as you grew up,

00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:53.080
what would they be?

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:54.840
HUDSON YANG: I
mean, some of them

00:07:54.840 --> 00:08:00.540
are not like direct-- like the
show, I don't really-- sorry,

00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:03.020
I can't talk right now.

00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:06.210
The stuff on the show hasn't
really happened to me directly,

00:08:06.210 --> 00:08:10.310
but there's been things on
the show that kind of relate

00:08:10.310 --> 00:08:12.680
to me, like the
part where I always

00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:16.300
ask my parents for like foods
that everybody else has,

00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:18.590
as in peer pressure
or something.

00:08:18.590 --> 00:08:21.050
That's like one of the episodes
where I ask for Lunchables.

00:08:21.050 --> 00:08:24.240
And then a time where
I had to stick up

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:26.225
for myself at one point.

00:08:26.225 --> 00:08:31.140
It didn't really get that
big, but I mean, yeah,

00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:32.909
it was really a long time ago.

00:08:32.909 --> 00:08:34.760
I can't remember it.

00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:37.210
And I think-- sorry.

00:08:37.210 --> 00:08:40.179
And then me playing
basketball with all my friends

00:08:40.179 --> 00:08:43.003
and like being in a court, that
kind of happened to me before.

00:08:43.003 --> 00:08:43.669
That's about it.

00:08:43.669 --> 00:08:48.506
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:48.506 --> 00:08:49.880
VINA HA: We have
a live question.

00:08:52.770 --> 00:08:55.141
AUDIENCE: On one of your
episodes, you got straight As.

00:08:55.141 --> 00:08:55.890
HUDSON YANG: Yeah.

00:08:55.890 --> 00:08:58.120
AUDIENCE: And I don't know if
somebody can cue the music.

00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:00.054
I was wondering if you
could do the pimp walk.

00:09:00.054 --> 00:09:03.710
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:05.460
SHILPA MANIAR: OK, we
can't get the music,

00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:07.150
but if you could drop us a beat.

00:09:07.150 --> 00:09:09.380
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:11.590
Do you mind showcasing the walk?

00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:14.280
We got any musicians out there?

00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:16.040
You want to just do the walk?

00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:17.760
HUDSON YANG: I
mean, like that one?

00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:19.970
SHILPA MANIAR: We
need the music.

00:09:19.970 --> 00:09:22.790
HUDSON YANG: Do you want me to
like wave my hands in the air?

00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:26.100
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:28.530
There's like a few different
types of pimp walks.

00:09:28.530 --> 00:09:29.830
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:29.830 --> 00:09:32.420
Everybody kind of has
their own way of doing it.

00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:34.378
SHILPA MANIAR: Do you
want to teach [INAUDIBLE]

00:09:34.378 --> 00:09:35.960
how to do the pimp walk?

00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:37.383
HUDSON YANG: I mean--

00:09:37.383 --> 00:09:38.674
SHILPA MANIAR: You wanna learn?

00:09:38.674 --> 00:09:42.800
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:43.770
All right!

00:09:43.770 --> 00:09:44.777
[CHEERING]

00:09:44.777 --> 00:09:46.610
VINA HA: Only if Hudson
is willing to teach.

00:09:46.610 --> 00:09:47.526
HUDSON YANG: I'm fine.

00:09:47.526 --> 00:09:48.167
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:48.167 --> 00:09:50.000
SHILPA MANIAR: Are you
up for the challenge?

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.420
VINA HA: I guess so now that
you've put me in the spot.

00:09:52.420 --> 00:09:53.974
SHILPA MANIAR:
Don't you love it?

00:09:53.974 --> 00:09:55.640
HUDSON YANG: I mean,
it's not that hard.

00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:57.610
Just like kind of keep
your shoulders back.

00:09:57.610 --> 00:09:59.630
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:59.630 --> 00:10:01.550
You can put your
hands like that.

00:10:01.550 --> 00:10:03.160
Or like go like that.

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:04.830
And just kind of walk like this.

00:10:04.830 --> 00:10:08.197
[CHEERING]

00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:12.160
SHILPA MANIAR: That was great.

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:15.725
VINA HA: This is going
to be on YouTube later.

00:10:15.725 --> 00:10:16.600
We can edit that out.

00:10:19.370 --> 00:10:21.880
All right, do we have
another live question?

00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:25.040
Does it involve me
dancing or doing anything?

00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:26.840
AUDIENCE: So who is
your favorite character

00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:28.625
to work for on the show?

00:10:28.625 --> 00:10:29.620
HUDSON YANG: Work with?

00:10:29.620 --> 00:10:30.300
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:35.470
And how is it living
in LA for the show

00:10:35.470 --> 00:10:37.705
compared to New York City?

00:10:37.705 --> 00:10:39.580
HUDSON YANG: I mean,
the question about who's

00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:41.110
my favorite is really hard.

00:10:41.110 --> 00:10:42.610
They're all amazing.

00:10:42.610 --> 00:10:45.845
They're really nice, fun.

00:10:45.845 --> 00:10:47.095
I mean, I can't really choose.

00:10:49.970 --> 00:10:53.380
But living out in LA means
that I'm closer to them,

00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:55.690
so we can hang
out, go eat dinner,

00:10:55.690 --> 00:10:59.050
talk about what's happening
in school and stuff

00:10:59.050 --> 00:11:02.080
and like about the
show, obviously.

00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:04.495
That's fun, amazing.

00:11:08.170 --> 00:11:10.670
VINA HA: OK, we're going
to-- should we take the Dory?

00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:15.060
OK, so this question
was voted pretty highly.

00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:18.430
So Hudson, if you could create
your own episode of "Fresh

00:11:18.430 --> 00:11:21.200
Off the Boat," what
would it be about?

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:23.700
HUDSON YANG: Oh.

00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:24.410
That's hard.

00:11:24.410 --> 00:11:30.160
I mean, maybe it
would be where I had

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:32.880
like a field trip or something.

00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:35.310
And then something
wild would happen,

00:11:35.310 --> 00:11:37.624
and I'd end up meeting
like Nicole on the trip.

00:11:37.624 --> 00:11:38.790
SHILPA MANIAR: Who's Nicole?

00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:41.203
HUDSON YANG: Oh, the girl that
I have a crush on on the show.

00:11:41.203 --> 00:11:41.606
SHILPA MANIAR: Oh, OK.

00:11:41.606 --> 00:11:42.105
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:42.105 --> 00:11:45.060
I thought she was another girl.

00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:47.245
HUDSON YANG: And
then while I'm there,

00:11:47.245 --> 00:11:49.510
like kind of like what
happened before when

00:11:49.510 --> 00:11:52.610
I was in like a
detention episode,

00:11:52.610 --> 00:11:55.030
we probably like
talk a little bit.

00:11:55.030 --> 00:11:57.710
And then, I don't
know, maybe my brothers

00:11:57.710 --> 00:11:59.387
would show up on a
different field trip.

00:11:59.387 --> 00:11:59.886
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:59.886 --> 00:12:00.780
SHILPA MANIAR: OK.

00:12:00.780 --> 00:12:02.516
HUDSON YANG: I
can't-- it's hard.

00:12:02.516 --> 00:12:04.730
There's a lot of
different things.

00:12:04.730 --> 00:12:06.972
Or maybe I'd meet
my cousins again.

00:12:06.972 --> 00:12:08.430
But then there
would be like girls,

00:12:08.430 --> 00:12:12.620
and they'd be like exactly
the opposite of us.

00:12:12.620 --> 00:12:16.920
And then we'd be like
feuding all the time, yeah.

00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:18.380
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:20.130
SHILPA MANIAR: I would
watch that episode.

00:12:20.130 --> 00:12:22.050
I think-- would you watch it?

00:12:22.050 --> 00:12:23.000
VINA HA: Of course.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.120
SHILPA MANIAR: You've got
two viewers right here.

00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:25.680
I can't wait.

00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:28.330
HUDSON YANG: [LAUGHS]

00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:30.400
VINA HA: There's another
question on the Dory.

00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:32.940
Hudson, do you get all the jokes
and references on the show?

00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:35.610
Or do you get your
father or mother

00:12:35.610 --> 00:12:38.780
to explain the jokes to you?

00:12:38.780 --> 00:12:40.550
HUDSON YANG: I mean,
I get most of them.

00:12:40.550 --> 00:12:42.550
But there's some where I
have to ask my parents,

00:12:42.550 --> 00:12:47.330
like what does this word
or this sentence mean?

00:12:47.330 --> 00:12:50.302
VINA HA: What's an example
of a word or sentence,

00:12:50.302 --> 00:12:51.260
like what's an example?

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:52.968
HUDSON YANG: I mean,
I think there's one,

00:12:52.968 --> 00:12:54.590
but I don't really remember it.

00:12:57.177 --> 00:12:59.510
VINA HA: Do you remember what
a Game Boy is or a Tetris?

00:12:59.510 --> 00:12:59.940
HUDSON YANG: Yeah, I have one.

00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:01.165
VINA HA: Oh, nice.

00:13:01.165 --> 00:13:02.660
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:02.660 --> 00:13:04.360
Nice.

00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:06.052
We have a live question.

00:13:06.052 --> 00:13:08.160
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I just
wanted to know a little bit

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:10.150
about your favorite
food preferences

00:13:10.150 --> 00:13:12.030
and whether you've
gone to Baohaus

00:13:12.030 --> 00:13:15.120
and what you like to eat there
and whether you read "Fresh

00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:16.430
Off the Boat."

00:13:16.430 --> 00:13:18.910
HUDSON YANG: Well, I
have gone to Baohaus.

00:13:18.910 --> 00:13:23.610
I've only eaten like one or
two of the special things.

00:13:23.610 --> 00:13:24.780
It's really good.

00:13:24.780 --> 00:13:26.220
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:29.860
I have read most
"Fresh Off the Boat,"

00:13:29.860 --> 00:13:32.080
but my dad won't let me
read any of the rest.

00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:34.900
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:34.900 --> 00:13:38.080
And what do you mean
by food preferences?

00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:39.790
AUDIENCE: Just in
terms of what you

00:13:39.790 --> 00:13:41.400
liked when you were
eating at Baohaus

00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:43.396
or what your favorite
Asian food is.

00:13:43.396 --> 00:13:47.290
HUDSON YANG: My favorite Asian
food would be sushi by far.

00:13:47.290 --> 00:13:51.580
But at Baohaus, I like the one
with like the meat, the chicken

00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:53.420
thing.

00:13:53.420 --> 00:13:55.530
AUDIENCE: It's like
fried chicken bao?

00:13:55.530 --> 00:13:57.470
HUDSON YANG: Kind of, yeah.

00:13:57.470 --> 00:13:59.190
I don't remember.

00:13:59.190 --> 00:14:01.030
I think my dad knows.

00:14:03.252 --> 00:14:04.960
VINA HA: Another
question from the Dory--

00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:07.790
which episode has been
your favorite to film?

00:14:07.790 --> 00:14:11.576
HUDSON YANG: My favorite
would be the one

00:14:11.576 --> 00:14:12.700
where I met Scottie Pippen.

00:14:15.660 --> 00:14:16.690
I talked really fast.

00:14:16.690 --> 00:14:17.860
VINA HA: What was that like?

00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:18.570
HUDSON YANG: Well,
it was really cool,

00:14:18.570 --> 00:14:19.720
because I got to meet him.

00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:22.750
He signed some stuff for
me and we took pictures.

00:14:22.750 --> 00:14:24.240
But he was really nice.

00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:29.820
And so me and my brothers,
my on-show brothers,

00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:31.941
we played basketball with him.

00:14:31.941 --> 00:14:33.690
And I actually got a
few shots off of him.

00:14:33.690 --> 00:14:36.090
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:36.090 --> 00:14:37.400
But he was distracted.

00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:39.780
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:39.780 --> 00:14:40.580
But, yeah.

00:14:42.824 --> 00:14:45.240
SHILPA MANIAR: So do you do
you have a favorite basketball

00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:46.860
team?

00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:48.260
HUDSON YANG: It
would most likely

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:50.300
be whichever team
Jeremy Lin's on.

00:14:50.300 --> 00:14:52.550
SHILPA MANIAR: OK, so it
just goes back to Jeremy Lin.

00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:53.300
HUDSON YANG: Yeah.

00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:55.567
SHILPA MANIAR: Does
Scottie Pippen know that?

00:14:55.567 --> 00:14:56.150
He knows that?

00:14:56.150 --> 00:14:56.649
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:56.649 --> 00:14:57.970
Broke his heart.

00:14:57.970 --> 00:15:00.510
You break girls' hearts, you
break Scottie Pippen's heart.

00:15:00.510 --> 00:15:02.160
Heartbreaker.

00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:04.570
VINA HA: We also have a
live question over here.

00:15:04.570 --> 00:15:05.111
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:15:05.111 --> 00:15:07.480
What do you want to
be when you grow up?

00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:09.813
HUDSON YANG: If I'm not an
actor when I want to grow up,

00:15:09.813 --> 00:15:13.890
I kind of want to be a
scientist or something.

00:15:13.890 --> 00:15:16.295
VINA HA: We can reserve
a spot for you here.

00:15:16.295 --> 00:15:17.720
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:19.220
We have fried chicken.

00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:22.210
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:22.210 --> 00:15:26.200
Eddie Huang has been here
doing this kind of talk.

00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:26.952
HUDSON YANG: Cool.

00:15:26.952 --> 00:15:28.410
SHILPA MANIAR: I
think his mom just

00:15:28.410 --> 00:15:30.790
requested that you
put that in writing

00:15:30.790 --> 00:15:33.077
that he has a job out here.

00:15:33.077 --> 00:15:34.160
VINA HA: We'll talk later.

00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:36.784
SHILPA MANIAR: He's an attorney,
so this works out really well.

00:15:36.784 --> 00:15:38.460
Attorney, mom.

00:15:38.460 --> 00:15:40.180
Mom, attorney.

00:15:40.180 --> 00:15:42.410
And it's on recording.

00:15:42.410 --> 00:15:43.847
It's great. [LAUGHS]

00:15:43.847 --> 00:15:45.805
VINA HA: We're going to
edit a lot out of this.

00:15:45.805 --> 00:15:47.389
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:47.389 --> 00:15:49.430
SHILPA MANIAR: Are there
any more live questions?

00:15:49.430 --> 00:15:53.260
Or should we continue
with the Dory?

00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:56.320
OK, so the next
question is, I grew up

00:15:56.320 --> 00:15:58.460
in Kansas in the mid '80s.

00:15:58.460 --> 00:16:03.340
And what show depicts
your early time?

00:16:03.340 --> 00:16:05.770
What show depicts
from the early time

00:16:05.770 --> 00:16:07.840
from the '80s that
really resonated

00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:09.780
with you from the '80s?

00:16:09.780 --> 00:16:11.920
How much fun is it
to try to recreate

00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:14.536
the mid '90s on screen?

00:16:14.536 --> 00:16:16.910
And I don't even know if you
know some of these examples.

00:16:16.910 --> 00:16:19.284
Do you know what
Pert Plus shampoo is?

00:16:19.284 --> 00:16:20.450
HUDSON YANG: Well, now I do.

00:16:20.450 --> 00:16:20.780
SHILPA MANIAR: Now you do.

00:16:20.780 --> 00:16:21.700
OK, so It's shampoo.

00:16:21.700 --> 00:16:22.950
Do you know what a minivan is?

00:16:22.950 --> 00:16:23.990
You should know a minivan.

00:16:23.990 --> 00:16:24.740
HUDSON YANG: Yeah.

00:16:24.740 --> 00:16:25.760
SHILPA MANIAR: OK.

00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:28.995
And then Baby Phat clothes.

00:16:28.995 --> 00:16:31.740
HUDSON YANG: Oh, well, I
have a friend in school who

00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:34.070
always wears that kind of swag.

00:16:34.070 --> 00:16:35.070
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:35.070 --> 00:16:36.860
SHILPA MANIAR: OK,
so is there something

00:16:36.860 --> 00:16:41.020
in the '80s that really
rang true to you,

00:16:41.020 --> 00:16:42.810
if you remember the '80s?

00:16:42.810 --> 00:16:44.050
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:44.050 --> 00:16:46.654
And then they want to know--

00:16:46.654 --> 00:16:49.610
HUDSON YANG: I
remember the '80s?

00:16:49.610 --> 00:16:51.610
SHILPA MANIAR: They want
to know how much fun it

00:16:51.610 --> 00:16:53.610
is to recreate the '90s.

00:16:53.610 --> 00:16:56.050
HUDSON YANG: Well, it's a lot
of fun to recreate the '90s.

00:16:56.050 --> 00:16:59.380
I mean, it's really cool seeing
what it was like back then.

00:16:59.380 --> 00:17:00.866
But about the '80s--

00:17:00.866 --> 00:17:02.240
SHILPA MANIAR:
It's too far back.

00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:04.130
HUDSON YANG: I wasn't alive.

00:17:04.130 --> 00:17:06.109
SHILPA MANIAR: We
remember the '80s.

00:17:06.109 --> 00:17:09.480
Should we tell you about
the '80s? [LAUGHS] It's OK,

00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:10.150
that's fair.

00:17:10.150 --> 00:17:10.780
That's fair.

00:17:10.780 --> 00:17:14.870
VINA HA: Hudson, has your
father ever had a success perm?

00:17:14.870 --> 00:17:18.800
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:20.376 --> 00:17:21.352
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:17:31.112 --> 00:17:33.552
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:33.552 --> 00:17:34.528
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:39.960
VINA HA: Awesome.

00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:41.920
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:43.560
SHILPA MANIAR: Sure.

00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:46.040
So next time we'll make
sure we bring it up to 2020

00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:49.090
or like in the 2000s for you.

00:17:49.090 --> 00:17:50.630
Second time you
come to Google, OK?

00:17:50.630 --> 00:17:51.839
You promise you'll come back?

00:17:51.839 --> 00:17:52.588
HUDSON YANG: Yeah.

00:17:52.588 --> 00:17:53.430
SHILPA MANIAR: OK.

00:17:53.430 --> 00:17:55.820
So if you could request
a guest appearance

00:17:55.820 --> 00:18:00.282
of any actor on the show, who
would you pick to work with?

00:18:00.282 --> 00:18:01.740
HUDSON YANG: Wait,
guest appearance

00:18:01.740 --> 00:18:03.354
of an actor on that
show, on my show?

00:18:03.354 --> 00:18:04.520
SHILPA MANIAR: On your show.

00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:05.400
HUDSON YANG: Yeah.

00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:06.850
Wait, a guest appearance?

00:18:06.850 --> 00:18:07.790
Wait, aren't there--

00:18:07.790 --> 00:18:09.960
SHILPA MANIAR: Like
if any other actor

00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:12.630
could come on to "Fresh Off
the Boat" and play your costar,

00:18:12.630 --> 00:18:13.522
who would it be?

00:18:13.522 --> 00:18:14.730
HUDSON YANG: Any other actor?

00:18:14.730 --> 00:18:16.915
Could I choose
somebody on my show?

00:18:16.915 --> 00:18:18.748
SHILPA MANIAR: They're
already on your show.

00:18:18.748 --> 00:18:19.850
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:19.850 --> 00:18:22.670
That's a fair, fair question,
fair question, Hudson.

00:18:22.670 --> 00:18:24.670
VINA HA: So like when
Scottie Pippin was a guest

00:18:24.670 --> 00:18:26.000
or your father was a guest.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:30.110
What's another person you
would want on the show?

00:18:30.110 --> 00:18:32.922
SHILPA MANIAR: Maybe your
sister wants to be on the show.

00:18:32.922 --> 00:18:33.880
Do you want to come up?

00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:36.680
You can come up.

00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:39.460
HUDSON YANG: It might
be my brother or maybe

00:18:39.460 --> 00:18:43.360
one of my other
friends or something.

00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:46.900
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:46.900 --> 00:18:49.676
VINA HA: For those
on VC who can't hear,

00:18:49.676 --> 00:18:51.800
Hudson's mom just made a
request to be on the show.

00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:53.141
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:53.141 --> 00:18:54.930
HUDSON'S MOTHER:
And a job at Google.

00:18:54.930 --> 00:18:56.140
VINA HA: And a job at Google.

00:18:56.140 --> 00:18:58.990
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:58.990 --> 00:19:01.930
OK, another question
involving your mom.

00:19:01.930 --> 00:19:04.702
Did your mom ever try to stop
you from becoming an actor?

00:19:04.702 --> 00:19:08.640
HUDSON YANG: I mean,
she's mostly supported me

00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:11.220
whatever decision I've made.

00:19:11.220 --> 00:19:16.780
But she did warn me not to
become too full of myself

00:19:16.780 --> 00:19:19.810
or to be like Justin
Bieber acting all like--

00:19:19.810 --> 00:19:21.770
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:21.770 --> 00:19:25.320
Or Miley Cyrus being like
all, running around getting

00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:27.990
in trouble or something.

00:19:27.990 --> 00:19:30.805
SHILPA MANIAR: What do you
think about tattoos, mom?

00:19:30.805 --> 00:19:32.055
HUDSON YANG: Or ear piercings?

00:19:32.055 --> 00:19:34.124
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:34.124 --> 00:19:35.290
HUDSON'S MOTHER: [INAUDIBLE]

00:19:35.290 --> 00:19:36.730
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:36.730 --> 00:19:37.230
[INAUDIBLE]

00:19:40.055 --> 00:19:41.680
SHILPA MANIAR: It's
negotiable, Hudson.

00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:43.010
Just remember that.

00:19:43.010 --> 00:19:46.580
Anything in life is negotiable.

00:19:46.580 --> 00:19:49.360
VINA HA: Do you have a
favorite line from the show?

00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:53.780
HUDSON YANG: I mean,
I've had a few.

00:19:53.780 --> 00:19:59.150
I think my favorite line was--
they were all pretty cool.

00:19:59.150 --> 00:20:02.860
I mean, I think it's the one
where it's like, it's not

00:20:02.860 --> 00:20:05.980
Shaq's shoe, but it will do.

00:20:05.980 --> 00:20:08.210
It was really funny
and it kind of

00:20:08.210 --> 00:20:12.679
made me seem like really picky.

00:20:12.679 --> 00:20:13.220
I don't know.

00:20:13.220 --> 00:20:15.946
It just stuck with
me for some reason.

00:20:15.946 --> 00:20:17.797
SHILPA MANIAR: So
we recently were

00:20:17.797 --> 00:20:19.380
reading a little bit
about you, and we

00:20:19.380 --> 00:20:23.410
learned that your favorite
subject in school is Mandarin.

00:20:23.410 --> 00:20:24.180
Is that true?

00:20:24.180 --> 00:20:26.340
HUDSON YANG: Well, because
it's really easy for me.

00:20:26.340 --> 00:20:28.316
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:28.316 --> 00:20:30.940
SHILPA MANIAR: OK, great
answer, great answer.

00:20:30.940 --> 00:20:35.550
So have you ever tried
to rap in Mandarin?

00:20:35.550 --> 00:20:38.400
HUDSON YANG: I mean, I've been
told to by one of my teachers

00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:40.080
that I used to have.

00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:41.370
But I failed epically.

00:20:43.379 --> 00:20:45.170
SHILPA MANIAR: Do you
want to do it for us?

00:20:45.170 --> 00:20:46.753
There's been requests
in the audience.

00:20:46.753 --> 00:20:48.790
HUDSON YANG: But I
don't know how to.

00:20:48.790 --> 00:20:50.050
That's why I failed epically.

00:20:50.050 --> 00:20:51.825
HUDSON'S MOTHER:
He failed Mandarin.

00:20:51.825 --> 00:20:53.325
HUDSON YANG: I
didn't fail Mandarin.

00:20:53.325 --> 00:20:54.600
I got an A+!

00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:58.030
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:01.470 --> 00:21:06.730
SHILPA MANIAR: OK, any
other live questions?

00:21:06.730 --> 00:21:07.510
OK--

00:21:07.510 --> 00:21:09.430
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:21:09.430 --> 00:21:12.100
HUDSON YANG: Yeah, sometimes.

00:21:12.100 --> 00:21:16.420
More of to my mom's mom and
sometimes to my grandma,

00:21:16.420 --> 00:21:18.215
who's right there.

00:21:18.215 --> 00:21:18.965
SHILPA MANIAR: Aw.

00:21:23.410 --> 00:21:26.410
OK, well so I guess if there's
no more live questions,

00:21:26.410 --> 00:21:29.030
we ran through the most
of the Dory questions.

00:21:29.030 --> 00:21:32.170
We want to wrap up
the conversation

00:21:32.170 --> 00:21:34.330
with an interesting
round of questions.

00:21:34.330 --> 00:21:37.680
We like to call this Vina and
Shilpa's rapid-fire round.

00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:39.400
So what we're going
to do is we're

00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:41.180
going to ask you a
question in Mandarin.

00:21:41.180 --> 00:21:44.430
And we're going to test how
well you understand Mandarin.

00:21:44.430 --> 00:21:47.389
And you have to respond
with one-word answers, OK?

00:21:47.389 --> 00:21:48.430
HUDSON YANG: Oh, my gosh.

00:21:48.430 --> 00:21:50.080
VINA HA: But we get to
use Google Translate.

00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:50.900
SHILPA MANIAR: Yeah.

00:21:50.900 --> 00:21:52.191
Because I don't speak Mandarin.

00:21:52.191 --> 00:21:54.820
I was just kidding.

00:21:54.820 --> 00:21:57.320
But we are going to
ask you a question,

00:21:57.320 --> 00:21:58.880
and what we want
you to do is we want

00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:01.310
you to either choose
between one or two

00:22:01.310 --> 00:22:02.762
or give us a one-word answer.

00:22:02.762 --> 00:22:03.720
HUDSON YANG: All right.

00:22:03.720 --> 00:22:05.820
SHILPA MANIAR:
OK, are you ready?

00:22:05.820 --> 00:22:06.570
HUDSON YANG: Yeah.

00:22:06.570 --> 00:22:06.650
SHILPA MANIAR: Yeah?

00:22:06.650 --> 00:22:07.200
Are you a little nervous?

00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:07.820
HUDSON YANG: Yeah.

00:22:07.820 --> 00:22:09.028
SHILPA MANIAR: You should be.

00:22:09.028 --> 00:22:09.980
No, I'm kidding.

00:22:09.980 --> 00:22:11.146
This is going to be fun, OK?

00:22:11.146 --> 00:22:11.910
HUDSON YANG: Yeah.

00:22:11.910 --> 00:22:13.743
SHILPA MANIAR: So our
first question for you

00:22:13.743 --> 00:22:15.627
is, Google or Bing?

00:22:15.627 --> 00:22:16.460
HUDSON YANG: Google.

00:22:16.460 --> 00:22:17.025
[CHEERING]

00:22:17.025 --> 00:22:18.150
SHILPA MANIAR: Good answer.

00:22:18.150 --> 00:22:20.000
VINA HA: Good answer.

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:21.670
HUDSON YANG: Bing is unreliable.

00:22:21.670 --> 00:22:25.670
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:25.670 --> 00:22:28.520
VINA HA: Uh, disclaimer-- we
didn't put him up to that.

00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:30.690
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:30.690 --> 00:22:32.600
Making sure.

00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:35.290
Biggie or Tupac?

00:22:35.290 --> 00:22:36.500
HUDSON YANG: Biggie.

00:22:36.500 --> 00:22:38.290
SHILPA MANIAR: Favorite food?

00:22:38.290 --> 00:22:39.720
HUDSON YANG: Sushi.

00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:42.290
VINA HA: Favorite
subject in school?

00:22:42.290 --> 00:22:43.990
HUDSON YANG: Science.

00:22:43.990 --> 00:22:44.630
It's changed.

00:22:44.630 --> 00:22:46.824
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:46.824 --> 00:22:48.490
SHILPA MANIAR: What's
your favorite part

00:22:48.490 --> 00:22:49.795
about being famous?

00:22:49.795 --> 00:22:52.320
HUDSON YANG: I'm not famous.

00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:54.350
SHILPA MANIAR:
That's very humbling.

00:22:54.350 --> 00:22:57.040
VINA HA: Who's your role model?

00:22:57.040 --> 00:22:57.790
SHILPA MANIAR: Aw.

00:22:57.790 --> 00:22:58.498
HUDSON YANG: Dad.

00:23:02.802 --> 00:23:05.010
SHILPA MANIAR: What's your
favorite line in the show?

00:23:07.055 --> 00:23:08.430
HUDSON YANG: I
said that already.

00:23:08.430 --> 00:23:11.360
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:15.532
SHILPA MANIAR: What's your
favorite sibling in the show?

00:23:15.532 --> 00:23:17.240
Who is your favorite
sibling in the show?

00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:21.649
HUDSON YANG: Oh, I
mean, they both have

00:23:21.649 --> 00:23:22.565
really good qualities.

00:23:22.565 --> 00:23:24.724
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:24.724 --> 00:23:26.390
Like one of them I
like him because he's

00:23:26.390 --> 00:23:28.245
really fun and enjoyable.

00:23:28.245 --> 00:23:31.760
And the other one, I like
him because he's a good kid

00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:33.980
and he's really good at acting.

00:23:33.980 --> 00:23:36.260
And so he's kind of
like a kid role model.

00:23:36.260 --> 00:23:37.010
SHILPA MANIAR: OK.

00:23:40.570 --> 00:23:43.665
VINA HA: Somebody already
asked this, but when I grow up,

00:23:43.665 --> 00:23:48.120
I want to be-- just making sure
your answers are consistent.

00:23:48.120 --> 00:23:49.960
What do you want to
be when you grow up?

00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:50.420
HUDSON YANG: Scientist.

00:23:50.420 --> 00:23:50.570
VINA HA: OK.

00:23:50.570 --> 00:23:51.280
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:53.010
Just testing, making
sure it's same.

00:23:56.280 --> 00:23:58.320
SHILPA MANIAR: When I
say Hudson, you say--

00:24:01.485 --> 00:24:02.610
HUDSON YANG: What do I say?

00:24:02.610 --> 00:24:05.949
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:10.239 --> 00:24:12.780
SHILPA MANIAR: All right, I'm
gonna rap you another line, OK?

00:24:12.780 --> 00:24:15.210
As I walk through the valleys
of the shadows of death,

00:24:15.210 --> 00:24:16.980
I take a look at myself and--

00:24:19.076 --> 00:24:21.201
HUDSON YANG: I don't know
what I'm supposed to say.

00:24:21.201 --> 00:24:22.469
SHILPA MANIAR: OK.

00:24:22.469 --> 00:24:23.510
You just finish the line.

00:24:23.510 --> 00:24:24.540
Just finish a line.

00:24:24.540 --> 00:24:25.230
OK.

00:24:25.230 --> 00:24:27.140
Do you got another
rap line for him?

00:24:27.140 --> 00:24:30.702
VINA HA: I don't, but I
have a regular question.

00:24:30.702 --> 00:24:34.620
SHILPA MANIAR: All right,
we'll just move on, then.

00:24:34.620 --> 00:24:38.527
VINA HA: The key to
being a good actor is--

00:24:38.527 --> 00:24:39.610
HUDSON YANG: To work hard.

00:24:42.390 --> 00:24:46.820
SHILPA MANIAR: Who has
more swagger, mom or dad?

00:24:46.820 --> 00:24:47.986
HUDSON YANG: Mom.

00:24:47.986 --> 00:24:49.735
I mean, depending on
what type of swagger.

00:24:49.735 --> 00:24:54.950
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:54.950 --> 00:24:58.160
VINA HA: OK, I think that's
all of our questions,

00:24:58.160 --> 00:25:00.740
so we'd like to
thank Hudson Yang.

00:25:00.740 --> 00:25:06.650
[APPLAUSE]

00:25:06.650 --> 00:25:09.550
We do have a gift
for you, so can we

00:25:09.550 --> 00:25:12.782
bring up the gift for Hudson?

00:25:12.782 --> 00:25:14.740
SHILPA MANIAR: That's
because you picked Google

00:25:14.740 --> 00:25:16.280
as your favorite search engine.

00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:17.321
HUDSON YANG: Google swag!

00:25:17.321 --> 00:25:19.160
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:19.160 --> 00:25:23.912
I got a Google NYC shirt.

00:25:23.912 --> 00:25:26.120
SHILPA MANIAR: Oh, everyone
gets to see what you got?

00:25:26.120 --> 00:25:26.660
OK.

00:25:26.660 --> 00:25:27.320
HUDSON YANG: Yes, they do.

00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:28.140
SHILPA MANIAR: We
hope you like it.

00:25:28.140 --> 00:25:29.400
HUDSON YANG: Thank you!

00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:32.049
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:32.049 --> 00:25:32.840
SHILPA MANIAR: Bye.

00:25:36.260 --> 00:25:38.860
Thank you all for coming.

00:25:38.860 --> 00:25:40.150
HUDSON YANG: Thank you.

00:25:40.150 --> 00:25:40.570
SHILPA MANIAR: Thank you.

00:25:40.570 --> 00:25:41.320
Thanks for coming.

00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:42.770
Do we get to shake your hand?

00:25:42.770 --> 00:25:43.270
Awesome.

00:25:43.270 --> 00:25:46.330
[APPLAUSE]

00:25:46.330 --> 00:25:47.710
Thank you.

00:25:47.710 --> 00:25:50.850
Thanks to your family members
that came to make it out.

00:25:55.990 --> 00:25:57.170
What an exit Hudson made.

00:25:57.170 --> 00:25:59.080
Great round of applause
for Hudson again.

00:25:59.080 --> 00:26:01.850
Thank you so much
for coming out here.

00:26:01.850 --> 00:26:03.400
[APPLAUSE]
