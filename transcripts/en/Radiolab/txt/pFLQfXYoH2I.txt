Speaker 1:          00:00          Let's just do it. You're going to do it. Okay. It's just freaking do it. Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad I'm Robert Krulwich, Radiolab, the pod guests. [inaudible] today's topic is, um, well, you know what, something you just did. I didn't, I had my eyes closed the whole time. Aw, you gave it away. You know what I'm about to say? Pretend you don't know what I'm saying. Okay. Today's topic is, um, something you just did actually what? Yeah, that you did. You did it again there in there. I don't know what it is. There's something with my fingernails. No, no. In there something. What? Tell me. Okay. You blinked. Oh, it's about, do you ever wonder, um, I know this about blinks. This is interesting, right? When you blink, you should, if you really understand what's going on since a little bit of darkness, cause after all your eyes are closed for an instant of time, but you don't because your mind erases the darkness of the blink.

Speaker 1:          00:56          So you can blink away, but the world will seem seamless and blink less to you. Even though your observers will see you blinking, you will not feel the blink inside. Do you ever wonder what is the actual purpose of the blink to wet in your eyeball? I assume? Well, that's what they tell you in ninth grade, but actually you would think of that is the case. They don't really humid days or let's say in the sauna you would blink less because it's very human and now you don't have the right thing. But very dry days, I would blink more. Yeah, they've, they've actually done studies where they put people in Saunas and they've at measured the rate of their blinks in there. It doesn't change. Oh, so there's something else [inaudible] reason for the blend. And so that's what we want to explore in this podcast. Why you do we blink? Actually, the answers are completely fascinating. Who are you going to ask this question to? A great scientist that blink cologists you will meet a blink ologists shortly. But first I want to take you to a guy who who uh, well he, he's a blink. Colleges have a different story. Let's say he doesn't really study blinks per se, but he, when we sort of stumbled into it.

Speaker 2:          01:59          My name is Walter Murch. I'm a film editor and I've been working as a both as a film editor and as a sound mixers since the late 1960s

Speaker 1:          02:08          Walter Merchant's edited some amazing films, apocalypse now, the godfather cold mountain. He's really one of the great editors in modern cinema. Oh, well thank you. Thank you. And he's also a great thinker about editing and he tells the following story about a discovery that he made while working on one of his early films.

Speaker 2:          02:25          Well, this was many years ago. Uh, when I was editing Francis Coppola was the conversation

Speaker 3:          02:36          [inaudible],

Speaker 2:          02:36          which by the way is another great, great movie was I think 1972 1973 and in the movie, Gene Hackman plays a surveillance expert. He spends the whole movie essentially trying to decode this one conversation that he's recorded. So Walter marches there, he's in the editing suite trying to put it all together. He was working late at night, all myself on this old editing machine, making a tape go and go backwards. And forwards.

Speaker 3:          03:06          Oh look, that's terrible. Cut Dead on a park bench.

Speaker 2:          03:12          And I was editing a scene when gene Hackman is a get him for Christmas. Yeah, he's already got the tapes. Okay. What he's listening to in his laboratory, what's a bit of a Meta moment actually, because on screen gene Hackman is editing tape and in his room, Walter merge his editing tape of Gene Hackman editing tape. A lot of fun. You know, every scene in a movie, even simple scenes require tons of cuts because as a viewer you're constantly being bounced around from one camera angle to the next, into the next. And though it seems like what you're watching is a continuous performance from the actor. It's actually been cobbled together by the editor from dozens of takes. So Walter Merchant's doing this, he's editing this scene, cut by laborious cut and it's important to understand he's making every cut by feel. What I will do is run the film at full, his mother mother's from try to feel the rhythm, you know, almost musical way and right when he's ready, who you there? Hit the cut button and then rewind. Run the film again and cut. And if I've hit that cut button on the same frame twice in a row, that tells me that I'm probably where I should be.

Speaker 1:          04:37          So he is editing this scene together, takes many days. He says, and somewhere along the way he begins to get this creeping sense,

Speaker 2:          04:47          you know, when you're in a room and maybe there's a leak outside and you, there's a little drip, drip, drip going on. I began to get the sense that,

Speaker 4:          04:59          uh,

Speaker 3:          05:01          that there were some

Speaker 2:          05:03          collaboration going on between myself and in this case gene Hackman cause he would find, he says that every time he made it, yeah. Cut. He would see that on the screen. Gene Hackman would have blinked [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          05:17          you mean your cuts kept falling smack in the middle of his blinks?

Speaker 2:          05:22          Oh yeah. Wow. When I saw it, well this is peculiar. Am I responding to him blinking? Oh, it didn't seem like that it was possible and yet the alignment was um, consistent

Speaker 4:          05:38          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          05:38          so Walter merged, developed a theory that maybe blinking has very little to do with [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          05:42          moisture or any of that. Maybe it's a kind of hidden punctuation to thought

Speaker 2:          05:50          we're storytelling. Thank you so much for agreeing to do this and this is a very cool idea, but it's just an idea and we wanted to know

Speaker 1:          05:58          if there's anything to this scientifically. Can you, can you do me a favor and introduce yourselves? Yes, yes. Tell them me first, but then we found out about these two Japanese researchers who were nice enough to Skype with us. My name is Tami Nakano and [inaudible] in the cognitive neuroscience. My name is [inaudible] and she was a student of mine. Okay. Tell me how mommy's going to talk and bring is [inaudible]. Very common, very common phenomenon, but the purpose of rank is military. Now the reason we had called to mommy and sugar was because they had just completed an experiment which they hoped would solve this mystery of blinking and what they did was they got a bunch of subjects together and they hooked each person up to a kind of Gizmo.

Speaker 5:          06:50          We put two electrodes, one above and one below the eye. And when we blink, we can recall very strong electrical signal and we can later analyze automatically when the subject blinked. This is actually what it sounds like when a person blanks and once they had everybody hooked up,

Speaker 1:          07:16          they played them a movie. Each puzzle I present the movie full street time. Which movie

Speaker 5:          07:25          did you use by the way? Uh, Ms Debbie. British quantity.

Speaker 1:          07:29          Okay. Mr. Bean, if you don't know the movie, I didn't. It's kind of like a farce. So that means that bean is the Mr. Bean because, uh, the story is easily understand without sound.

Speaker 5:          07:45          The reason she took out the sand was for, well, it's actually not that interesting why she took out the sound. What they did was they watched people watching movies, recorded their blanks. Each time they watched and what they found was really weird.

Speaker 1:          08:02          First thing they noticed within each person, uh, Dave's blink at the same time point in the movie,

Speaker 5:          08:10          meaning people when they watch the movie many times tend to always blink in the same spots,

Speaker 1:          08:16          but weirder than that. Also the timing of breach occurred. At the same time between people, they found a large percentage of their subjects actually fell in sync. They began to blink at the exact same moment in the movie. Oh, often did synchronization occurred between people.

Speaker 5:          08:38          Uh, so, uh, according to [inaudible] analysis, one third of

Speaker 1:          08:45          blinks contributed to synchronization. Just to appreciate that. I mean, imagine you're sitting in a movie theater with 200 other people, dark, the movie starts, action gets on the way and you're just there watching and with each unconscious blink that you make 70 people make that blink right with you. Like all these little butterfly wings fluttering at the same time. Oh yeah. Yeah. Wow.

Speaker 1:          09:18          And so they, uh, this was the question was why, why does this happen? And uh, yeah, they analyze their data with that question in mind. What they found is that what seems to be happening is that people, as they watched the movie, get in sync with the story. They intuit the narrative flow sort of peaks in the valleys of the tail and they're able to align their blinks so that they fall right in the gaps. Those little micro beets where nothing happens. Yes. We found that, uh, uh, rink synchronizes occurred at the conclusion of a action by the OCTA. We start by Mr [inaudible]. She gave a bunch of examples. One example is the empty street. There's a moment in the film, she says where all you see is this empty street for just a few frames just to beat. And that moment everybody blinks these streets or you know when Mr. Bean walks into a room, closes the door, right as the door finishes closing, everybody blinks.

Speaker 5:          10:15          So these sound like rest stops. If they were the New Jersey turnpike is be where you'd go in and get your coffee. Exactly. Say if it's an eyeball, you just blinked.

Speaker 6:          10:25          One reason is that, uh, we don't want to miss very important point in, in the story [inaudible] hypotheses is that you see blinking is related to the punctuation. Our ways of thinking. Maybe there is some kind of synchronization of the thinking of the editor or film maker, uh, that might, uh, you see, make us blink at the same time. Huh. But still, there's a white

Speaker 1:          10:55          question here like, cause why would we even need to do that in a blink and no one knows really. But it may be that we blink at all because we can only process life in chunks. Might Be Chow, make a tanking of the uh, role of, of information now for effective processing information processing or a effective memorizing

Speaker 5:          11:23          in computer terms. It's like that moment when we saved a dish was enough information in our buffer so to speak. And now we think I've got to remember this and that's at that moment that we blink. Huh? That's what Walter Mertz. Thanks. But who knows? Oh, it's popping a new tape every time you blink. Yeah, because I noticed that culturally, um, when you feel that you are done, you know enough changes over time. Like my daughter will watch a Cary grant movie and the character played by Cary grant will be in bed, throw off the covers, put his feet on the floor, get up and then walk to the door. The whole thing. She thinking like, come on, come on guy. Just she wants it to calm and go chunk and go. And so I don't know. She's blinking madly Susie, but she's clearly frustrated because she knows her. Yeah. I'm not sure that the chunking isn't an artifact of where, how you see when you're alive, like when you're alive. Yeah. I wonder if the, if the blink rates have changed over over generations, I'm sure they have

Speaker 1:          13:14          two years of darkness, which you are, which thanks to your lovely brain. You're totally unaware of missing. Thank you Brad. Thank you, ray. I am, I'm getting up. I'm rod and I remember call it Radiolab is supported in part by the Sloan Foundation, the corporation for public broadcasting and one other. We have one other, the biggest one in the mall, the National Science Foundation. Yes. Before we close, I just want to thank Tim Howard for production help on this podcast and I want to urge everyone listening right now.
