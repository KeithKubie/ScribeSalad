so we're gonna just put it in a second

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:05.740
so we're gonna just put it in a second

biased towards traditional media so if
we're gonna answer this question we have

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:23.020
we're gonna answer this question we have
 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:24.899
we're gonna answer this question we have
to classify all the channels that trend

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:24.909
to classify all the channels that trend
 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:26.850
to classify all the channels that trend
and find out if their traditional media

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:26.860
and find out if their traditional media
 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:28.919
and find out if their traditional media
or not I had to make some definitions of

00:01:28.919 --> 00:01:28.929
or not I had to make some definitions of
 

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:30.330
or not I had to make some definitions of
my own here for the types of channels

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:30.340
my own here for the types of channels
 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:32.010
my own here for the types of channels
that our traditional media versus what

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:32.020
that our traditional media versus what
 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.169

is a youtuber or independent creator and

00:01:34.169 --> 00:01:34.179
is a youtuber or independent creator and
 

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:35.580
is a youtuber or independent creator and
I made a few other classifications as

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:35.590
I made a few other classifications as
 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:37.169
I made a few other classifications as
well and now all we have to do is figure

00:01:37.169 --> 00:01:37.179
well and now all we have to do is figure
 

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:38.699
well and now all we have to do is figure
out which of these two thousand channels

00:01:38.699 --> 00:01:38.709
out which of these two thousand channels
 

00:01:38.709 --> 00:01:41.160
out which of these two thousand channels
is which manual classification like this

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:41.170
is which manual classification like this
 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:43.020
is which manual classification like this
would take way too long for one person

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:43.030
would take way too long for one person
 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:44.999
would take way too long for one person
so I enlisted 70 people from my second

00:01:44.999 --> 00:01:45.009
so I enlisted 70 people from my second
 

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:46.590
so I enlisted 70 people from my second
channel in order to help me crowdsource

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:46.600
channel in order to help me crowdsource
 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.569
channel in order to help me crowdsource
this data classification and when that's

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:48.579
this data classification and when that's
 

00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:50.880
this data classification and when that's
all finished you get this so this is

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:50.890
all finished you get this so this is
 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:53.039
all finished you get this so this is
what we get how do we read it so the

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:53.049
what we get how do we read it so the
 

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:55.050
what we get how do we read it so the
first thing is is the color key blue

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060
first thing is is the color key blue
 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.510
first thing is is the color key blue
will be traditional media orange is

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520
will be traditional media orange is
 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.480

anyone who trended with less than 10,000

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:06.969
anyone who trended with less than 10,000
 

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:08.999
anyone who trended with less than 10,000
subscribers so what do we get all right

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:09.009
subscribers so what do we get all right
 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:11.370
subscribers so what do we get all right
so the y-axis is the average view count

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.380
so the y-axis is the average view count
 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:13.830
so the y-axis is the average view count
they got before they got on training so

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840
they got before they got on training so
 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.300
they got before they got on training so
as soon as we got we see them on

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310
as soon as we got we see them on
 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:16.860
as soon as we got we see them on
trending how many views do they have

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870
trending how many views do they have
 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.090
trending how many views do they have
when that happens so we can think of

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.100
when that happens so we can think of
 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:19.710
when that happens so we can think of
that as sort of the barrier to them

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720
that as sort of the barrier to them
 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.090
that as sort of the barrier to them
getting on training how many views they

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100
getting on training how many views they
 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.220
getting on training how many views they
needed to get on trending and then we

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230
needed to get on trending and then we
 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:25.710
needed to get on trending and then we
have the number of unique trending

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720
have the number of unique trending
 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.520
have the number of unique trending
videos so let's do a for instance let's

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530
videos so let's do a for instance let's
 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.059
videos so let's do a for instance let's
say you have I don't know Lele pons she

00:02:33.059 --> 00:02:33.069
say you have I don't know Lele pons she
 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:35.280
say you have I don't know Lele pons she
seems to have trended about 10 times on

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290
seems to have trended about 10 times on
 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.680
seems to have trended about 10 times on
the training tab and she it took her

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690
the training tab and she it took her
 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.170
the training tab and she it took her
about four million views on average to

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180
about four million views on average to
 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.180
about four million views on average to
get on trending goes ten times okay so

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190
get on trending goes ten times okay so
 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:44.219
get on trending goes ten times okay so
that's how to read this so what do we

00:02:44.219 --> 00:02:44.229
that's how to read this so what do we
 

00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:45.500
that's how to read this so what do we
find

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510
find
 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.970
find
well the data is pretty clear number one

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980
well the data is pretty clear number one
 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.580
well the data is pretty clear number one
if you are high up on this you're not

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590
if you are high up on this you're not
 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.350
if you are high up on this you're not
going to be trending a lot the chances

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:53.360
going to be trending a lot the chances
 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:54.850
going to be trending a lot the chances
are you don't we don't see you trend a

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:54.860
are you don't we don't see you trend a
 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:56.380
are you don't we don't see you trend a
lot and that sort of makes intuitive

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390
lot and that sort of makes intuitive
 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:58.360
lot and that sort of makes intuitive
sense if it takes you a lot of views to

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370
sense if it takes you a lot of views to
 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:00.190
sense if it takes you a lot of views to
trend you're a lot less likely to trend

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200
trend you're a lot less likely to trend
 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:01.660
trend you're a lot less likely to trend
a lot because it's very hard to get

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.670

steps in fixing the system it's about

00:09:35.509 --> 00:09:35.519
steps in fixing the system it's about
 

00:09:35.519 --> 00:09:37.999
steps in fixing the system it's about
more than fixing a simple ratio it's

00:09:37.999 --> 00:09:38.009
more than fixing a simple ratio it's
 

00:09:38.009 --> 00:09:39.799
more than fixing a simple ratio it's
about giving the creators who build this

00:09:39.799 --> 00:09:39.809

00:09:51.089 --> 00:09:55.639
platform a fair chance I'm trying to
understand what does YouTube want what

00:09:55.639 --> 00:09:55.649
understand what does YouTube want what
 

00:09:55.649 --> 00:10:00.859
understand what does YouTube want what
what does YouTube want what would that's

00:10:00.859 --> 00:10:00.869
what does YouTube want what would that's
 

00:10:00.869 --> 00:10:02.210
what does YouTube want what would that's

trying to deconstruct this we can look

trying to deconstruct this we can look
 

00:12:07.170 --> 00:12:10.790
trying to deconstruct this we can look
at this we can look at what the output

00:12:10.790 --> 00:12:10.800
at this we can look at what the output
 

00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:12.410
at this we can look at what the output
is because we know the input

00:12:12.410 --> 00:12:12.420
is because we know the input
 

00:12:12.420 --> 00:12:15.350
is because we know the input
and if we have the we have the algorithm

00:12:15.350 --> 00:12:15.360
and if we have the we have the algorithm
 

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:17.870
and if we have the we have the algorithm
we sort of have the output but it's also

00:12:17.870 --> 00:12:17.880
we sort of have the output but it's also
 

00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:20.090
we sort of have the output but it's also
the case that if you have the output and

00:12:20.090 --> 00:12:20.100
the case that if you have the output and
 

00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:21.980
the case that if you have the output and
the input you can make inference as to

00:12:21.980 --> 00:12:21.990
the input you can make inference as to
 

00:12:21.990 --> 00:12:25.610
the input you can make inference as to
what the algorithm the black box is and

00:12:25.610 --> 00:12:25.620
what the algorithm the black box is and
 

00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:27.680
what the algorithm the black box is and
that's what this video is all about so

00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:27.690
that's what this video is all about so
 

00:12:27.690 --> 00:12:29.180
that's what this video is all about so

my intention when only talking about

my intention when only talking about
views was to shift the conversation away

views was to shift the conversation away
 

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:35.360

from this and to talk about this because

from this and to talk about this because
 

00:12:35.370 --> 00:12:38.629
from this and to talk about this because
this is in the end what actually matters

00:12:38.629 --> 00:12:38.639
this is in the end what actually matters
 

00:12:38.639 --> 00:12:40.730
this is in the end what actually matters
