00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
And the answer is actually this one.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
If you don't believe me, you should absolutely try this out.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Get in a car or on a train and while going along at constant speed,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
drop an object in front of yourself.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
You will see that it falls straight down.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Now, this may cause you to ask yourself what is going on?

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
I'm seeing the same results when I drop an apple on a train that's moving pretty fast

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
as I see when I drop an apple on the ground, and the ground is stationary, right?

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Well, in fact, in physics motion at a constant speed is absolutely

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
indistinguishable from being at rest.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
If you were on this train and you boarded up all the windows,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
and again remember it's moving perfectly smoothly but at a constant speed,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.000
there is no experiment that you could do to determine whether you're moving or at rest.

00:00:44.000 --> 99:59:59.000
That is pretty mind-blowing, I think.
