00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Now we can come up with an equation for the motion of the moon around the earth.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
The earth should be sitting at the origin of our coordinate system.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
The moon should be starting on the x axis

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
and should be moving in a counterclockwise direction.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Of course, there's something with cosine and sine.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Specify the details.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
What do we have in front of the cosine and sine?

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Is it 4 x 10⁸ m, is it 27 days, is it 2.5 x 10⁻⁹ m,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
or is it 2π x 27 days?

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
What's on the inside of cosine and sine?

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.000
2π x t, or t, or π x t?

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Then times, or divided by?

00:00:46.000 --> 09:59:59.000
27 days, or 4 x 10⁸ m?
