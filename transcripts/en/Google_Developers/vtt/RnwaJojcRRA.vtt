TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hello,
I'm Timothy Jordan

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:03.890
for The Developer Show.

00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:06.098
Now this is your update on
the coolest developer news

00:00:06.098 --> 00:00:08.160
from Google in the last week.

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:09.780
Stick around to the
end for highlights

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.070
from Google Cloud Next.

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.640
But first, Android P
beta 4 is now available.

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:17.340
It's the final preview
update before we

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.740
launch the official Android
P platform later this summer,

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:22.410
and includes a release
candidate build

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.220
with final system behaviors and
the official Android P APIs.

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.500
Head on over to the post
linked in the description

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.390
below to wrap up your testing in
time for the official release.

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.330
Chrome 68 is now available
and includes several updates

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:39.300
for developers, including add
to home screen changes, the page

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.750
lifecycle API, the payment
handler API, and more.

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.120
Details are on the post.

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.970
Dialogflow recently introduced
several new beta features

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:50.820
to expand conversational
capabilities for customer

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.010
support and contact centers.

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.380
Head on over to the post
for details and screenshots

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:58.080
of knowledge connectors,
automatic spelling correction,

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:00.210
and phone gateway.

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.060
The Go team at Google recently
released a new open source

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:05.280
project called Go Cloud.

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.190
It's a library and tools for
developing on the open cloud

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:11.220
to help you build portable
cloud applications.

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.410
Take a look at the post
for details of how it works

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:15.660
and how to get involved.

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:18.330
Google Cloud Next
2018 was last week

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.460
in San Francisco, California.

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.560
There were a ton
of announcements.

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.920
Here's just a few highlights.

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.900
Cloud Build is a fully managed,
continuous integration,

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.790
and continuous
delivery platform that

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.740
lets you build and
test applications

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.440
in the cloud at scale.

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:37.620
We're connecting GitHub with
Cloud Build to provide fast,

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:42.960
frictionless, and convenient CI
for any repository on GitHub.

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.730
Updates to our
serverless compute stack

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:47.490
include new App Engine
runtimes, Cloud Functions

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.310
general availability,
and serverless containers

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.680
on Cloud Functions.

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.560
New database features along
with partnerships, beta news,

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.510
and other improvements
can help you get

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:00.660
the most out of your databases.

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:03.510
Transparent SOIs, or
Service Level Indicators,

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:05.910
give you fine-grained
detail about the behavior

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:07.950
of Google Cloud
Platform services

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.979
as related to your workloads.

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.550
And BigQuery ML, which is a new
capability inside BigQuery that

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:16.440
enables you to build
and deploy machine

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.950
learning models on massive
structured or semi-structured

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.050
datasets.

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:24.180
There was a lot more,
but don't worry if you

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:25.260
couldn't be at the event.

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.720
Just head on over to the
Google Cloud YouTube channel

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.640
