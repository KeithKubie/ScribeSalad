00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090
this one takes a little time they sort
 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.139
this one takes a little time they sort

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280
it uh and then when they start repeating
 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.010
it uh and then when they start repeating
things over and over it's like okay like

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090
this this is going to be the message but
 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.020
this this is going to be the message but
I don't know it's a more clever message

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030
I don't know it's a more clever message
 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.350
I don't know it's a more clever message
in my opinion and you know obviously a

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360
in my opinion and you know obviously a
 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:01.700
in my opinion and you know obviously a
big chunk of this movie is going to be

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710
big chunk of this movie is going to be
 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.830
big chunk of this movie is going to be
about memory loss make your door a

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840
about memory loss make your door a
 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.170
about memory loss make your door a
short-term memory loss and for someone

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180
short-term memory loss and for someone
 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.059
short-term memory loss and for someone
who does not have a very good memory I

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069
who does not have a very good memory I
 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.660
who does not have a very good memory I
really look up to a character who is

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670
really look up to a character who is
 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:13.220
really look up to a character who is
trying to go through the

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230
trying to go through the
 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:14.780
trying to go through the
tire film go through this adventure with

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790
tire film go through this adventure with
 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.960
tire film go through this adventure with
a really bad memory uh and I felt they

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970
a really bad memory uh and I felt they
 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.690
a really bad memory uh and I felt they
kind of represented that you know

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700
kind of represented that you know
 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.430
kind of represented that you know
definitely that determination but also

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440
definitely that determination but also
 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.670
definitely that determination but also
the frustration of dealing with that and

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680
the frustration of dealing with that and
 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.300
the frustration of dealing with that and
I like the way the characters kind of

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310
I like the way the characters kind of
 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.160
I like the way the characters kind of
react off of her I like that you know

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170
react off of her I like that you know
 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:32.809
react off of her I like that you know
they can get annoyed but they also see

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:32.819
they can get annoyed but they also see
 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:35.000
they can get annoyed but they also see
like even through all this nonsense like

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010
like even through all this nonsense like
 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:36.949
like even through all this nonsense like
she's not stopping and she's not giving

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959
she's not stopping and she's not giving
 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:39.470
she's not stopping and she's not giving
up and she's discovering what she can

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480
up and she's discovering what she can
 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.110
up and she's discovering what she can
remember and can't remember and why she

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120
remember and can't remember and why she
 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.970
remember and can't remember and why she
remembers it so there's also a nice

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980
remembers it so there's also a nice
 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.699
remembers it so there's also a nice
mystery element to it as well because in

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709
mystery element to it as well because in
 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:47.390
mystery element to it as well because in
the first film

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400
the first film
 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.490
the first film
you gotta find Nemo and that's fine it

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500
you gotta find Nemo and that's fine it
 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.740
you gotta find Nemo and that's fine it
works great but there's also this

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750
works great but there's also this
 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.650
works great but there's also this
mystery of where are her parents are

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660
mystery of where are her parents are
 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.610
mystery of where are her parents are
they even still around um is this you

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620
they even still around um is this you
 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.860
they even still around um is this you
know how is she gonna find her way there

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870
know how is she gonna find her way there
 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.280
know how is she gonna find her way there
and back uh so I like that like

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290
and back uh so I like that like
 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.470
and back uh so I like that like
incorporating all that I also like that

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480
incorporating all that I also like that
 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.289
incorporating all that I also like that
a Nemo in this movie actually has a

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:09.299
a Nemo in this movie actually has a
 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:11.720
a Nemo in this movie actually has a
bigger role I am okay not not a big role

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730
bigger role I am okay not not a big role
 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.059
bigger role I am okay not not a big role
but a bigger role because in the first

00:03:14.059 --> 00:03:14.069
but a bigger role because in the first
 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:17.210
but a bigger role because in the first
