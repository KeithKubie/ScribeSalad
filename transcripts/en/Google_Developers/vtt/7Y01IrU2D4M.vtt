IDO GREEN: Hi, I'm
Ido Green, a developer

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:09.550
advocate for Actions on Google.

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:10.630
In my last video--

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:11.860
link up here--

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:14.380
I showed you how to create
a trivia template to create

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:16.239
an app without any code.

00:00:16.239 --> 00:00:19.000
Now I'll show you how to
use the personality quiz

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.330
template to create a new app
for the Google Assistant.

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:23.920
The best part of
this template is

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:25.780
that you don't need any code.

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:27.966
We've made it easy to
you to get started.

00:00:27.966 --> 00:00:29.590
In addition to showing
you how to build

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:32.470
an app with a template,
I'll share some suggestions

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:35.170
on how to create traits
and outcomes for the quiz

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:37.480
and how to submit
your app for review.

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:38.830
Let's check it out.

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:41.200
To get started, open
the Action console.

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.610
There are three template
options you can choose from.

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.320
To select the
personality quiz, simply

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.150
click on the Build button.

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:51.870
The next few steps are the same
for all three app templates.

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.060
Click the Next under
the bips, the robot,

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:56.220
to select this personality.

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:59.670
Now we're getting the part where
you get to customize your app.

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.960
Click on Upload Content
Via Google Sheet.

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.990
Click on the hyperlink to
create a copy of the template

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:07.590
we've made for you.

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.610
You'll get a new browser
tab with this option.

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.200
Click on the Make a Copy button.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.850
Make sure to change the
content on all three tabs

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:17.120
we provided here.

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:20.000
The blue sections
should not be changed.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.370
We suggest to design
the personality quiz

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:25.130
by first defining your
outcomes and traits,

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:28.220
then working backwards
to your questions.

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.840
For example, the traits speed,
supernatural, flight, stealth,

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.080
alien, and strength could
be useful for a superhero

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:37.810
personality quiz.

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:40.580
The personality quiz
uses traits to map a user

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:42.470
to a possible outcome.

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:45.110
It will ask one
question for each trait,

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:47.450
and their response
will mark that trait

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.970
as either positive or negative.

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:53.300
When the quiz is over, the
final values of all the traits

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.060
build a profile that is
mapped to the closest

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:57.900
matching outcome.

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:01.110
Keep in mind best
practices like answers

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.650
work best when they require
three or fewer words.

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:07.080
Keep questions clear
and short, and keep

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.060
the answers even shorter.

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.520
Check out the
description for a link

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.890
to even more best practices.

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.260
Once the questions and
traits are filled in,

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.600
and positive and
negative are identified,

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.840
click on the Outcome tabs
and fill this in as well.

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.710
This will help the algorithm
match the right final results

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:28.560
based on the user's answers.

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.810
Lastly, click on the
Configuration tab

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.960
and make sure to change
the values of each cell

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:35.500
to fit to your app.

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.530
After that, you're done here.

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.170
Copy the Google Sheet
URL and paste it

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:45.270
into the previous screen in the
Google Sheet browser URL field.

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:47.120
Click on Connect.

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.950
Once your content is
uploaded successfully,

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:54.010
click on Create App, which
will close this wizard.

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:55.230
Congrats!

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.110
You've just finished
the hard part.

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:59.350
And it wasn't hard
at all, right?

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:02.570
Now it's time to take
your app for a test drive.

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:04.550
Click on the simulator
on the left side,

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:06.910
or on the Test App button.

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:09.220
Here is what the
simulators look like.

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.780
We'll focus on the left side.

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:14.330
The web simulator is a great
tool for testing your app

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:18.170
and seeing how it's going to
work on the Google Assistant.

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:20.930
It's important to test that
everything is working well

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:23.540
before submitting
your app for a review.

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:26.120
As you can see, you
could talk or type

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:29.070
to test your personality quiz.

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:32.400
By the way, if you are
logged into your Assistant

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.610
with the same account on
your phone or Google Home,

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:39.070
you could test your
creation there as well.

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:41.940
Once you've tested your
app, you're done building,

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:45.270
and it's time to move
on to the app review.

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:48.210
Make sure your app follows our
content guidelines and best

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:49.440
practices--

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:54.800
link below-- before submitting
it to Google for review.

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:57.970
If your app is approved, it will
be available to all Assistant

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:58.960
users.

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:01.930
To submit your app for review,
go to the Overview page

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:05.100
for your project in
the Actions console.

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:07.660
Click on the App
Information section.

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:10.770
Click Add, and fill out
the requested information.

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:12.360
Most of this
information is public

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.890
and appears in the
system directory.

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:17.490
When you are done filling
out your app information,

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:20.560
you'll return to the
Assistant App Draft page.

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:23.650
You can skip the location
targeting section, the surface

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:26.530
capability section, and
account linking section

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:28.000
by clicking Next.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.810
Remember, template apps work
on all surfaces supported

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:33.590
by the Google Assistant.

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:36.850
Click Submit Draft for
Review to submit your app.

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:38.950

the review process,

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:41.740

the description below.

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:42.490
That's it.

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:43.580
You're all done.

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:44.445
Thanks for watching.

00:04:44.445 --> 00:04:45.820

that will pass the review.

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:57.870
Until next time, be strong,
and create amazing Actions.
