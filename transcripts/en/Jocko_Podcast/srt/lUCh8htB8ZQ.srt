1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:04,870
In the discipline equals freedom
field manual. The section fear reads,

2
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:10,120
how do you overcome feel
fear of failure step go.

3
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:13,660
But a previous entry reads,

4
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:16,840
I don't want you to
overcome fear of failure.

5
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:21,800
I want you to be afraid of
failure. Mind elaborating. Yeah,

6
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:23,630
clearly there's a dichotomy here.

7
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:27,390
I know it's my favorite word apparently
according to Dean lister. Yes, I agree.

8
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:32,620
There is a dichotomy here because fear
is something good that you should take

9
00:00:33,381 --> 00:00:36,590
advantage of. So it's kind of good to
be afraid because it keeps you on edge.

10
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:38,480
Agile keeps you from slacking.

11
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:44,450
It keeps you preparing as much as you
possibly can and all that stuff is good.

12
00:00:44,451 --> 00:00:48,290
But at the same time, yes, if you go too
far to the other end of the spectrum,

13
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,540
fear gets a hold of you
and you can't overcome it.

14
00:00:50,541 --> 00:00:53,960
So you freeze or you cower or you runaway.
And none of those are good reactions.

15
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:58,610
So what I obviously failed to
communicate well in the book,

16
00:00:58,611 --> 00:01:03,611
discipline equals freedom field manual
is the dichotomy between these spectrum,

17
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:10,160
the spectrum of fear that you can have.
So if you have no fear whatsoever,

18
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:14,490
no fear. Well guess what? You get
cocky. You can get arrogant. Um,

19
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:18,860
if you have too much fear, you can't even
get out of the gate. You just freeze.

20
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:23,210
You hesitate. So like all dichotomies,
you got to balance those two.

21
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:25,343
The, and

22
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:31,460
the way you balance those two is to try
and do things that make you feel fear.

23
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:34,940
Right? And try and do things
that, that make you feel fear.

24
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:39,800
So that way you get used to it. You
can overcome it, you can deal with it,

25
00:01:39,801 --> 00:01:42,320
you can utilize it. If you have a fighter,

26
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:45,320
you ever hear UFC fighters that I'll
come afraid every time I get in the ring.

27
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:48,440
Yeah, pretty much everybody. Yeah.
Pretty much everybody I'm afraid.

28
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:50,690
Cause you're, you're afraid you're
gonna get knocked out. You're afraid.

29
00:01:50,691 --> 00:01:50,830
This is,

30
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:54,470
you're afraid that you're afraid I'm
gonna lose in front of all my family and

31
00:01:54,471 --> 00:01:56,600
friends and all that. So everyone's
afraid. So what does that fear do?

32
00:01:56,690 --> 00:01:58,760
It drives you to train
harder, drives you to prepare.

33
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:02,030
It drives you to keep your hands up and
your chin down when you're in the cage.

34
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,760
So yeah, there's a healthy
level of fear. It can also get,

35
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:11,480
get the best of you. So
keep it balanced. Yeah,

36
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,640
we talked about this
and I think Sam Harris

37
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:18,960
talk about at first as far as the first
I heard it made a point not to go too

38
00:02:18,961 --> 00:02:23,550
deep into it, but the, where
you know, like this. Okay. Fear,

39
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:27,840
uh, how do you overcome fear step go.
Right. It's essentially like take action,

40
00:02:27,841 --> 00:02:32,370
be brave in the face of fear, right? But
if there's no fear, it's kind of like,

41
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:34,810
hmm, you're not really being brave.
You're not, you know, kind of thing.

42
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:39,060
Well that's true too. Yeah. So consider
that, that notion, right? So you say,

43
00:02:39,061 --> 00:02:41,700
yeah, I want you to be afraid of
failure. Oh yeah. Be Afraid of failure,

44
00:02:41,701 --> 00:02:44,790
but you still got to step. You still
got to go. You still gotta be brief,

45
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:48,930
you know, kind of thing. So they do
actually kind of compliment each other.

46
00:02:48,931 --> 00:02:53,190
Really. Um, unless you think like,
oh yeah. Overcome fear, meaning like,

47
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:56,370
I'm not scared of it anymore.
It's literally not figured
that it's always fear,

48
00:02:56,371 --> 00:02:59,590
but it's more, it's less about
the fear being, you know,

49
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,890
reduced to zero. It's
more about being brave,

50
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:07,770
training yourself to be embraced with
here. Yeah. Embrace the fear and the,

51
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:12,070
and so to continue with that thought,
in order to embrace the fear,

52
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:15,370
what do you do? You step. Do
you go into it? So there you go.

53
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:16,540
There's your answer. Cool.
