00:00:00.648 --> 00:00:02.970
- [Voiceover] The article
featured the Sea Islands

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.488
because many were known there to live

00:00:06.488 --> 00:00:10.191
much as their ancestors of a century

00:00:10.191 --> 00:00:12.257
ago had lived.

00:00:12.257 --> 00:00:15.288
So this one immediately seems strange

00:00:15.288 --> 00:00:16.866
because they're saying
the article featured

00:00:16.866 --> 00:00:19.571
the Sea Islands because many were known,

00:00:19.571 --> 00:00:21.754
so when they're saying
featured the Sea Islands

00:00:21.754 --> 00:00:23.993
because many were known, I'm thinking

00:00:23.993 --> 00:00:26.483
that when they're saying many were known,

00:00:26.483 --> 00:00:28.619
I think they're talking
about the Sea Islands

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.674
because that's what the
article was featured on.

00:00:30.674 --> 00:00:33.854
Because many were known there to live

00:00:33.854 --> 00:00:34.528
much as their ances--

00:00:34.528 --> 00:00:37.523
Well islands don't live
much as their ancestors.

00:00:37.523 --> 00:00:39.659
So the way this reads it
sounds like, you know,

00:00:39.659 --> 00:00:41.946
the article was talking about Sea Islands

00:00:41.946 --> 00:00:44.778
because many of the Sea Islands were known

00:00:44.778 --> 00:00:47.344
to live like the Sea Islands' ancestors.

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.704
Well islands don't have ancestors,

00:00:50.704 --> 00:00:51.819
at least in the way that we traditionally

00:00:51.819 --> 00:00:54.325
think about it, so this
is just badly phrased.

00:00:54.325 --> 00:00:55.777
So I'm going to rule it out as it is.

00:00:55.777 --> 00:00:57.170
So I'm going to rule out choice A,

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.434
which is the kind of as it is.

00:00:59.434 --> 00:01:00.711
So they're really talking about where

00:01:00.711 --> 00:01:02.755
the residents were known to live

00:01:02.755 --> 00:01:03.938
as their ancestors.

00:01:03.938 --> 00:01:06.329
So we have to be a little
bit more specific here.

00:01:06.329 --> 00:01:07.907
The article featured the Sea Islands

00:01:07.907 --> 00:01:10.689
because they were known for living,

00:01:10.689 --> 00:01:13.914
well once again, they,
it's not the Sea Islands.

00:01:13.914 --> 00:01:15.923
We're really talking about the residents,

00:01:15.923 --> 00:01:17.617
the people of the Sea Islands.

00:01:17.617 --> 00:01:20.683
So I'm going to rule this one out as well.

00:01:20.683 --> 00:01:22.099
The article featured the Sea Islands

00:01:22.099 --> 00:01:25.175
because many of the people there

00:01:25.175 --> 00:01:28.182
were known to live much as their ancestors

00:01:28.182 --> 00:01:30.341
of a century ago had lived.

00:01:30.341 --> 00:01:31.701
Well at least this one's conveying

00:01:31.701 --> 00:01:33.638
the right impression.

00:01:34.161 --> 00:01:35.211
It's making it clear we're not talking

00:01:35.211 --> 00:01:37.092
about the Sea Islands' ancestors,

00:01:37.092 --> 00:01:39.077
or the Sea Islands living
like their ancestors,

00:01:39.077 --> 00:01:41.194
we're talking about the
people who are known

00:01:41.194 --> 00:01:44.050
to live there live like their ancestors.

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:46.975
So this one is feeling pretty good.

00:01:46.975 --> 00:01:48.484
Let's try the other choices.

00:01:48.484 --> 00:01:50.388
The article featured the Sea Islands

00:01:50.388 --> 00:01:53.047
because of the many people,

00:01:53.047 --> 00:01:58.047
they were there living
much as their ancestors

00:02:00.674 --> 00:02:02.288
of a century ago had lived.

00:02:02.288 --> 00:02:04.134
So once again, you have this comma here,

00:02:04.134 --> 00:02:05.387
this is convoluted, and it's also

00:02:05.387 --> 00:02:07.163
not completely clear.

00:02:07.163 --> 00:02:09.207
The article featured the Sea Islands

00:02:09.207 --> 00:02:12.109
because of the many people,

00:02:12.109 --> 00:02:13.247
they were living.

00:02:13.247 --> 00:02:16.532
This makes it sound like the Sea Islands

00:02:16.532 --> 00:02:19.411
are somehow a subset of the many people,

00:02:19.411 --> 00:02:20.943
and still that they're talking about

00:02:20.943 --> 00:02:24.762
the Sea Islands themselves were living

00:02:24.762 --> 00:02:25.609
like their ancestors.

00:02:25.609 --> 00:02:27.355
Once again, it doesn't make sense,

00:02:27.355 --> 00:02:28.551
or at least it's confusing.

00:02:28.551 --> 00:02:30.351
So I'm going to rule that one out.

00:02:30.351 --> 00:02:32.336
The article featured the Sea Islands

00:02:32.336 --> 00:02:36.898
because of knowing that
many people lived there

00:02:36.898 --> 00:02:41.898
much as their ancestors of
a century ago had lived.

00:02:43.934 --> 00:02:46.790
Well this one has all sorts of problems.

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:50.272
If you said because of
knowing that many people

00:02:50.272 --> 00:02:53.255
lived there much as their ancestors

00:02:53.255 --> 00:02:55.171
of a century ago had lived,

00:02:55.171 --> 00:02:56.634
it leaves you hanging.

00:02:56.634 --> 00:02:58.851
Well what was because of knowing

00:02:58.851 --> 00:03:00.012
that many people had lived there?

00:03:00.012 --> 00:03:01.336
So it leaves you hanging.

00:03:01.336 --> 00:03:03.495
It's also just convoluted.

00:03:03.495 --> 00:03:08.057
Because of knowing that many people

00:03:08.057 --> 00:03:11.099
had lived there much as their ancestors?

00:03:12.344 --> 00:03:13.559
Because we know this fact,

00:03:13.559 --> 00:03:14.500
something is going to be there

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:15.347
and they didn't even tell us

00:03:15.347 --> 00:03:17.013
what is because of knowing?

00:03:17.013 --> 00:03:20.728
So this one is also really,
really, really strange.

00:03:20.728 --> 00:03:23.292
So definitely like C.

00:03:23.292 --> 00:03:25.511
The article featured the Sea Islands

00:03:25.511 --> 00:03:28.575
because many of the people there

00:03:28.575 --> 00:03:31.987
were known to live much as their ancestors

00:03:31.987 --> 00:03:34.124
of a century ago had lived.

00:03:34.124 --> 00:03:36.235
Yeah, that's nice and understandable.
