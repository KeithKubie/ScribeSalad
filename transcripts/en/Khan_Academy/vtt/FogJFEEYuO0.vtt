00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:04.040
A riparian buffer is
an area around a stream

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:06.230
that's covered in vegetation.

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:08.720
The buffer protects
the water in the stream

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:10.932
from activity happening
near its location.

00:00:10.932 --> 00:00:12.390
So let's imagine
this a little bit.

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:15.460
So let's say that I have
a stream right over here.

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:18.840
So this right over
here is my stream,

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.720
and the riparian
buffer is an area

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.070
around the stream that's
covered in vegetation.

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.950
So this could be the riparian
buffer right over here

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:28.160
on this side of the
stream, and maybe there's

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.259
another one on this side of
the stream right over here.

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:35.750
Suppose you run a farm
near a riparian buffer.

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:39.530
The buffer begins S feet
from the edge of your farm

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:44.020
and ends B feet from
the edge of your farm.

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:46.870
How wide is the riparian buffer?

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:49.860
So this right over here
could be maybe my farm.

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:57.360
So I've got my farm here, those
are my crops, just like that.

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.500
And they're saying
the buffer begins

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.170
S feet from the
edge of your farm.

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.720
So, actually, let's say
that this right over here

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:06.810
is the edge of my farm.

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.890
And it says it begins S feet
from the edge of your farm.

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:11.640
So it depends which
side you consider

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.210
to be the beginning of
the riparian buffer.

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:16.590
Maybe we'll take this
side to be the beginning.

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.510
And so they're saying this
distance right over here

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:24.580
is S feet, and it ends B feet
from the edge of your farm.

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:29.150
So they're saying that this
distance right over here all

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:33.210
the way to the other side of
the riparian buffer is B feet.

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.690
How wide is the riparian buffer?

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:39.380
So the way I made my assumptions
about where the riparian buffer

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.350
starts and ends,
it looks like it's

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:46.130
going to be B minus
S. It looks like it's

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:48.800
going to be B minus s,
which would be this distance

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:49.530
right over there.

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.390
So that is B minus
S. But I just assumed

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.810
the buffer starts
here and ends here.

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.690
I could have viewed it
the other way around.

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:03.260
I could have said, hey,
look, the buffer starts here.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.750
The buffer starts on
this side, and this

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.300
would be my S. And
I could have said,

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.210
maybe it ends on
this side, and then

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:14.840
this would be the B. We
really don't know which one

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.640
is the start or the
end of the buffer.

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.720
And in this world
right over here,

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.800
we would say that
the difference,

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:31.620
or how wide the riparian
buffer is, would be S minus B.

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.580
But one way that we
make sure that we're

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:36.038
going to get a positive answer
either way-- because we want

00:02:36.038 --> 00:02:37.584
our distance to
be positive-- is,

00:02:37.584 --> 00:02:39.000
well, we could
say, look, we don't

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.700
know if it's S minus
B or B minus S,

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.785
so let's just take the
absolute value of these.

00:02:43.785 --> 00:02:48.760
So absolute value of B minus
S, even in this situation right

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.180
over here, is going to
give the same exact answer

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.470
as the absolute value
of S minus B. It's just

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:57.200
going to find the absolute
difference between these two

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.050
values regardless of
which one is larger.

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:01.150
So let me make that clear.

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.640
The absolute value of B
minus S is the same thing

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:07.710
as the absolute
value of S minus B.

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:11.090
And so I would go with
either one of these.

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:13.900
Let's do another one.

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:18.490
Doctor When is a time-traveling
alien with a PhD.

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:23.340
In the year 1999, Doctor When
is sitting in Central Park,

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:26.130
New York City and
eating a hot dog.

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:29.340
He then realizes that
he's forgotten his hat.

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.540
To retrieve his hat,
he travels T years,

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:36.320
where T is a
negative to represent

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:38.580
going backwards in time.

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:42.750
What do we know about
the sum 1999 plus T?

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:44.730
So we know that T is
a negative number.

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:45.990
He's going backwards in time.

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:47.610
So let's look at the choices.

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:53.330
1999 plus T is the absolute
value of T greater than 1999.

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:56.110
No, that would've been true
if T is a positive number.

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:58.080
Then we'd say, hey,
this right over here

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:02.540
is going to be the absolute
value of T greater than 1999.

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:04.570
This would have been
only in a positive,

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:08.650
so that would have been in a
situation if T is positive.

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:09.617
So let's read this one.

00:04:09.617 --> 00:04:15.070
1999 plus T is the absolute
value of T less than 1999.

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:15.777
That's right.

00:04:15.777 --> 00:04:17.860
Imagine a situation-- we
know that T is negative--

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:21.920
imagine T as being
equal to negative 3.

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:29.710
Then 1999 plus T would
be equal to 1996,

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:41.180
which is 3 years less than, so
this is 3 years less than 1999.

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:43.260
And this 3 right
over here-- or we

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:47.594
could write that
1996 is-- instead

00:04:47.594 --> 00:04:49.010
of saying 3 years
less than-- it's

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:57.560
the absolute value of negative
3 years less than 1999.

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:59.480
So this one works out.

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:03.100
1999 plus T is going to
be the absolute value,

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:06.090
the absolute magnitude
of that negative number

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:08.590
T less than 1999.

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:11.590
So we could go with
this, right over here.

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:13.430
Let's do one more.

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:17.130
You're using an auger to
drill a hole for a fence post.

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:20.950
The bottom of the hole is at
a position of negative 2.3

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:22.210
relative to ground level.

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:23.680
So let's draw the ground.

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:28.840
So here is the ground right over
here, that's the ground level.

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:31.255
And the bottom of my
hole-- so I drill a hole.

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:37.020
And the bottom of the
hole is at a position

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:39.970
of negative 2.3 feet.

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:47.090
So this position right over here
is negative 2.3 feet relative

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:48.550
to ground level.

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:51.880
The fence post has a
length of 4.7 feet.

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:53.770
How much higher
is the fence post

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:55.930
when it stands atop
the ground than when

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:58.050
it is sitting in
the hole you dug?

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:00.070
So when it is sitting
atop the ground-- so let

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:02.390
me draw the fence post.

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:05.480
So when it's sitting
atop the ground,

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:08.360
the fence post looks
something like this.

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:12.180
And so when it's sitting atop
the ground, it's 4.7 feet high.

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:15.490
4.7, so this distance
right over here.

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:18.960
So if I were to draw-- so
let me make this clear.

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:22.990
So this right over
here is negative 2.3.

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:26.190
This right over here is 4.7.

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:28.905
That's how tall it is when it's
sitting on top of the ground.

00:06:28.905 --> 00:06:30.280
How much higher
is the fence post

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:31.946
when it stands atop
the ground than when

00:06:31.946 --> 00:06:33.690
it's sitting in
the hole you dug?

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:36.920
So when you put this fence
post in the hole you dug,

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:39.500
it's going to go down 2.3 feet.

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:43.015
So it's going to
go down 2.3 feet.

00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:47.967
You could figure out
what this height is,

00:06:47.967 --> 00:06:50.550
but they're not even asking us
this height above ground level.

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:53.890
They're just saying, how
much does the top go down

00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:55.630
when it's sitting
in the hole you dug?

00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:59.700
So it's pretty clear that
this distance right over here

00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:02.440
is going to be 2.3 feet.

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:05.910
It's going to go
2.3 feet lower, when

00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:08.080
you stick it into the hole.

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:09.610
So how much higher
is the fence post

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:11.076
when it stands atop
the ground than when

00:07:11.076 --> 00:07:12.540
it's sitting in
the hole you dug?

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:18.589
It's 2.3 feet higher when
it's stands atop the ground.
