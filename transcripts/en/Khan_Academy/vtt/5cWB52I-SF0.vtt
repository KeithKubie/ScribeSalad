00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:04.170
In this first, what I'll call
this is my first real linear

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:11.250
algebra video, I want to
introduce you to some concepts

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.660
that you're going to see over
and over in linear algebra,

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:16.280
and if they're not introduced
to you properly in the

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:17.980
beginning, they can
be very confusing.

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:19.930
But hopefully over the course
of this video, you'll

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:22.400
understand that they're pretty
straightforward ideas.

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.490
If anything, in linear algebra,
the field, or the

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:28.830
gods of linear algebra, are
kind of experts in to some

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.950
degree stating simple and
obvious things in convoluted

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:33.050
and Byzantine ways.

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:34.700
But it does that for a
reason; it gives it

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.620
mathematical rigor.

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.330
So the first thing I want to
introduce you to is the set

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:44.400
notation for real numbers and
then multiple dimensions of

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:45.070
real numbers.

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:48.820
So if you ever see this, an R
with an extra backbone like

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:53.220
that, or sometimes it's written
as just a really

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:57.040
bold-faced R if it's maybe
typed in a book, a really

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:08.810
bold-faced R, this just means,
the set of all real numbers.

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.510
And I probably should make a
few videos where I classify

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:16.380
numbers by reals and complex
and irrational and rational

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.410
and whatever else, and there's
actually very formal ways of

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:24.250
defining the set of all real
numbers, but the simple thing

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:26.460
for me is all numbers
except complex ones.

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.300
So this is the same thing as

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:35.840
everything but complex numbers.

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:40.730
So pi is a real number, e is a
real number, square root of 2

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:44.250
is a real number, 3 is a real
number, minus 3 is a real

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:50.630
number, minus pi is a real
number, But 1 plus 2i is not a

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:51.560
real number.

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.120
It's not in the set of reals;
that's a complex number.

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:55.460
So everything but complex.

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:58.230
So pretty much all regular
numbers that you ever dealt

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:00.360
with before you learned
what i was.

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.540
That's the set of
real numbers.

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:06.660
Now, the next thing you'll see
when you start discussing

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:10.090
linear algebra is someone will
write-- they won't just write

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:17.350
the set of all real numbers,
they'll write Rn.

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:18.570
And you're like, gee,
what is that?

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:22.000
Are they somehow taking
the exponent of

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.460
all of the real numbers?

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:26.100
And actually on some level, that
is what they're doing,

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:30.710
but what they're saying here is
they're taking the set of

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:32.900
all ordered sets of
real numbers.

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.550
So what do I mean by that?

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:37.190
So let me do an example where
I don't just have Rn,

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:45.310
So R2 is the set of all lists
of real numbers, and let me

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:46.440
make one of the lists.

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.020
So let's say this has
one number and then

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:51.810
it has another number.

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.330
So it's the set of -- let me
write it this way, so I can

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:55.460
write in the set of notations.

00:02:55.460 --> 00:03:00.110
It's the set of all-- we could
call these tuples.

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:07.310
Sometimes it's called a 2-tuple,
which just means a

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:08.370
list of two numbers.

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:09.180
That's all it means.

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.920
It just means a list
of two numbers.

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:16.760
So R2 is a list of all ordered
2-tuples, so all ordered lists

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:17.340
of two numbers.

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.350
Let me actually write down the
word ordered because that's

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:25.010
important, so ordered
list of 2-tuples.

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:27.760
So, for example, this would
be-- well, let me

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.460
write it this way.

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:32.870
This would be a different-- when
I say ordered, I'm saying

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:35.690
that this is fundamentally
different than that, that

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:38.240
these aren't the same 2-tuple.

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:42.010
Each of these is a 2-tuple,
but R2 is a set of all

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:48.730
2-tuples such that-- that line
there just means such that or

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:58.825
maybe for which-- each of
the numbers-- and I'll

00:03:58.825 --> 00:04:00.280
write it this way.

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.250
I could just write-- well, I
could write it a couple of

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:05.480
ways, but I'll write it in the
harder to understand way, just

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:06.570
so you get used to it.

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:12.130
Such that xi is a member
of the reals.

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:20.140
So member of, that's what this
little character means.

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:22.010
So that each xi is a member
of the reals.

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:22.770
So what do you you mean xi?

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:30.530
Well, xi just means any of these
x's, and I'll write for

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:35.610
i is less than or equal to 2 and
greater than or equal to

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:39.550
1, and i is an integer.

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:43.090
Now, I could have written this
a bunch of different ways.

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:46.220
This is almost silly how much
effort I'm taking to write it

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:48.720
this way, but I could have
written it like this, too.

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:54.290
I could have written that R2
is equal to the set of all

00:04:54.290 --> 00:05:01.180
ordered tuples, x1 x2 such
that-- I could have just

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:06.780
written such that x1 and x2
are a member of the reals.

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:07.670
I could have written
it that way.

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:10.400
That would have been an easier
way to write it.

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:12.020
But either way, I think
you get the idea.

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:14.110
It's all of the combinations
of two things.

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:19.460
So I said in the beginning,
this kind of is a squared

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:21.720
operator. and why do
they write it as

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:22.470
a superscript there?

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:30.750
And my gut sense is if you think
about it, you have an

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:34.290
infinite number of
real numbers.

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:37.430
I won't go into things like
accountability and things like

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:39.820
that, but you have a very large
number of real numbers.

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:43.830
But let's say that you only
had n real numbers, right?

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:46.440
Let's say that we weren't
dealing with reals.

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:48.880
Just for sake of argument, let's
say that you had like

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:50.910
100 real numbers, right?

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:52.430
So that means that there
would've been 100

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:54.880
possibilities there, and then
there's another 100

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:56.260
possibilities there.

00:05:56.260 --> 00:06:00.200
So now your set of all the
possibilities of 2-tuples,

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:03.390
well, you'd have 100 times 100
possibilities, so you'd almost

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:06.030
have the squared number
of possibilities.

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:10.220
So however many possibilities
you have for R, you have that

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:13.670
many squared possibilities for
R2, which doesn't make a lot

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:15.237
of sense, because you have
an infinite number of

00:06:15.237 --> 00:06:17.170
possibilities, but you have that
many more possibilities.

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:19.470
You have an infinite number of
possibilities here and an

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:20.840
infinite number of possibilities
here.

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:24.120
So it's almost a greater
infinity of potential

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:25.290
possibilities.

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:27.430
Now, what's R3?

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:29.070
R3 is just the same thing.

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:38.940
R3 means you're going to have
three points or three numbers.

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:40.990
I want to be careful not
to just say points.

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:46.550
We can graph these things, and,
for example, R2, point in

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:51.730
R2 can normally be graphed on
graph paper just in Cartesian

00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:52.510
coordinates.

00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:54.930
Points in R3 can be graphed
in three dimensions.

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:59.300
Points in just R, or we could
just say R1, you could just

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:01.390
graph those on a number line.

00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:04.430
I can have a number line like
that, and if I had to graph

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:05.900
pi, you know, that's 0.

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:07.830
I just say, hey, right
there, that's pi.

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:09.240
And if i had to graph e,
I'd say, hey, right

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:10.000
there, that's e.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.320
And if I had to graph 1,
I'd say, hey, that's 1.

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:14.330
So you could graph them, but
I want to be careful.

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:16.370
You don't have to graph them.

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:18.730
They don't have to correspond
to actual

00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:20.970
physical points on a graph.

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:23.000
But anyway, when you talk about
R3, you're literally

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.640
just talking about all the
possibilities where you have

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:28.970
an ordered set of three numbers,
where all three

00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:32.060
numbers are a member of
the real numbers.

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:33.680
That's all you're saying.

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:35.370
Now, I want to introduce
you to another

00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:37.275
definition of a vector.

00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:43.780
Now, a vector, you've
seen before.

00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:45.740
You've seen it in physics,
where you said, oh, it's

00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:47.930
something that has a magnitude
and a direction.

00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:51.800
You saw it in calculus, and we
plotted them and whatever not.

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:54.410
But I'm going to be very formal
and very abstract and

00:07:54.410 --> 00:07:58.700
very broad with the vector right
now because the beauty

00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:02.230
of linear algebra is that it
doesn't just apply to things

00:08:02.230 --> 00:08:06.120
like physics, and it doesn't
just apply-- well, it does

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:09.100
apply a lot to physics, but it
doesn't just apply to that.

00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:11.060
In linear algebra, you can
apply it to anything.

00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:13.100
It doesn't have to apply to
things that just graphs in

00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:13.780
three dimensions.

00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:15.830
And we'll talk more about that
in the future, but that's why

00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:19.830
I'm trying to stay
pretty abstract.

00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:24.690
So I'm going to define
a vector in Rn, a

00:08:24.690 --> 00:08:26.580
vector to be in Rn.

00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:27.800
Actually, let me be careful.

00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:29.500
I haven't even defined
what Rn is.

00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:34.740
I just defined R2 and R3,
so let me define Rn.

00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:43.409
Rn is equal to the set of all
n-tuples, ordered n-tuples.

00:08:43.409 --> 00:08:48.160
So you have x1, x2, all
the way over to xn.

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:50.380
So you're going to have n
things; so if this was 100,

00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:52.180
you'd have 100 things here.

00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:58.980
So this is an ordered n-tuple.

00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:06.442
This is an ordered n-tuple, such
that for each xi, where

00:09:06.442 --> 00:09:10.820
xi is one of these, it is a
member of the real, so each of

00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:13.210
these has to be a real number.

00:09:13.210 --> 00:09:19.470
And then I'll just say for i
is less than or equal to n,

00:09:19.470 --> 00:09:21.900
greater than or equal to 1.

00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:25.990
So all that's saying is that x1
is a member of the reals,

00:09:25.990 --> 00:09:28.890
x2 is a member of the reals,
all the way up to xn is a

00:09:28.890 --> 00:09:29.910
member of the reals.

00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:35.440
Rn is the set of all of these
possible ordered n-tuples or

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:38.360
ordered sets of n numbers.

00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:40.800
So what is a vector?

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:43.810
What is a vector in Rn?

00:09:43.810 --> 00:09:47.360
Well, a vector in Rn really is
just a particular instance of

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:48.590
one of these n-tuples.

00:09:48.590 --> 00:09:55.065
I'll just call it an ordered
list of n real numbers.

00:09:59.930 --> 00:10:03.030
And you can represent a vector
in a bunch of different ways.

00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:07.290
You could represent
it like this.

00:10:07.290 --> 00:10:10.850
You could represent it like--
let me do it a bunch of

00:10:10.850 --> 00:10:13.090
different ways.

00:10:13.090 --> 00:10:16.190
A two-dimensional vector, you
could represent like x1, x2,

00:10:16.190 --> 00:10:17.180
kind of like a coordinate.

00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:20.200
You could maybe represent it
with brackets like that.

00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:21.300
This is just syntax.

00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:24.150
This is just different ways
of representing the same

00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:26.510
information, the same idea.

00:10:26.510 --> 00:10:28.440
And for most of what we talk
about in linear algebra, we're

00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:31.690
going to represent them as
essentially these columns, and

00:10:31.690 --> 00:10:33.370
in the very near future,
we'll represent

00:10:33.370 --> 00:10:35.000
them as rows as well.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.280
But I'm going to define
my vector.

00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:41.670
A vector as an Rn is an
ordered list of n real

00:10:41.670 --> 00:10:44.390
numbers, and I define-- and
this is an example.

00:10:44.390 --> 00:10:54.750
So it would be v1, v2, all the
way to vn, where each of these

00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:56.155
is a member of the
real numbers.

00:11:01.130 --> 00:11:04.830
And just to make sure you
understand the notation or the

00:11:04.830 --> 00:11:06.950
terminology, each of
these is called a

00:11:06.950 --> 00:11:16.360
component of our vector.

00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:18.630
Actually, I want to be very
careful here, because when we

00:11:18.630 --> 00:11:21.850
write vectors, you want
to make sure you

00:11:21.850 --> 00:11:23.130
have a nice bold v.

00:11:23.130 --> 00:11:26.480
I won't make all my v's in the
future that bold, but that's

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:29.540
how, when you're reading a math
book, they differentiate

00:11:29.540 --> 00:11:32.200
between just a vector and just
a regular quantity , right?

00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:36.090
These regular quantities are
just written non-bolded, while

00:11:36.090 --> 00:11:38.530
the vectors are bolded.

00:11:38.530 --> 00:11:47.850
Now, I'm going to define two
operations for vectors in Rn.

00:11:47.850 --> 00:11:52.460
I'm going to define addition,
and these are definitions.

00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:55.040
I could've defined them in any
arbitrary way, but these I

00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:58.400
think you'll find to be somewhat
natural, so these are

00:11:58.400 --> 00:11:59.650
definitions.

00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:06.000
These are just human abstract
constructs that end up

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:07.210
becoming very useful.

00:12:07.210 --> 00:12:08.800
So they said, hey, let's
make some definitions.

00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:10.340
Let's define addition.

00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:18.510
So, if I have some vector-- let
me write it as a lowercase

00:12:18.510 --> 00:12:22.460
a, but it's a really bolded
lowercase a, and then that is

00:12:22.460 --> 00:12:25.230
equal to a1, a2.

00:12:25.230 --> 00:12:28.900
That's all of it's components
all the way to an, and I want

00:12:28.900 --> 00:12:31.120
to add that.

00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:34.400
And then I have vector b-- and
I'm going to make that a

00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:41.440
really bolded b right there--
is equal to b1, b2, all the

00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:46.690
way to bn, I'm going to define
addition of these two vectors

00:12:46.690 --> 00:12:51.010
to be just the sum of each
of their components.

00:12:51.010 --> 00:13:04.260
Bolded a, plus bolded b is equal
to a new vector, where

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:05.740
you just add each of
their components.

00:13:05.740 --> 00:13:08.620
It's going to be a1 plus
b1 is going to

00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:10.420
create this new component.

00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:16.200
a2 plus b2, all the way
down to an plus bn.

00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:20.910
And if you found this somewhat
confusing, just think, I'm

00:13:20.910 --> 00:13:23.360
almost going through pains to
write something very simple in

00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:28.130
very confusing terms. If I have
two vectors in R2, let's

00:13:28.130 --> 00:13:33.810
say I have the vector 2, minus
1, and I want to add that to

00:13:33.810 --> 00:13:41.060
the vector 3, 2, I literally
just add each of the

00:13:41.060 --> 00:13:42.280
corresponding components.

00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:44.460
So I add the first components
to each other.

00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:47.390
So 2 plus 3 is equal to 5.

00:13:47.390 --> 00:13:50.030
Minus 1 plus 2 is equal to 1.

00:13:50.030 --> 00:13:53.740
That's all my definition of
vector addition is for my

00:13:53.740 --> 00:13:55.490
vectors in real numbers.

00:13:55.490 --> 00:13:59.410
And now the next thing I'm going
to define is the idea of

00:13:59.410 --> 00:14:00.660
a scalar multiple.

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:09.490
You might remember from physics
class, a scalar is

00:14:09.490 --> 00:14:11.930
just a regular number, or if
your multiplying something by

00:14:11.930 --> 00:14:13.920
a scalar, you're just
scaling it up.

00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:16.710
Maybe I shouldn't use the same
word in the definition, but

00:14:16.710 --> 00:14:19.990
I'm going to define it as--
let me say c is a scalar.

00:14:19.990 --> 00:14:24.110
So notice, I didn't
bold the c.

00:14:24.110 --> 00:14:30.070
So c times my vector a-- and
here I'm going to take pains

00:14:30.070 --> 00:14:36.120
to bold it up-- is going to be
equal to all of my components

00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:40.500
of vector a multiplied by
each, multiplied by c.

00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:45.840
So a1, a2, all the way to an,
and they're each going to be

00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:48.790
multiplied by c.

00:14:48.790 --> 00:14:51.800
So that's all I define-- every
term is going to be

00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:52.870
multiplied by c.

00:14:52.870 --> 00:14:57.070
And just to give you an example
like that, if I wrote

00:14:57.070 --> 00:15:04.630
minus 3 times some vector--
I'll just

00:15:04.630 --> 00:15:06.390
draw the vector here.

00:15:06.390 --> 00:15:08.010
Let me draw a vector in R3.

00:15:08.010 --> 00:15:14.370
So let's say the first term is
pi, the second term is minus

00:15:14.370 --> 00:15:18.200
2, and then the third term is 0,
then this is just going to

00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:26.360
be equal to a new vector in R3
or you can kind of view it as

00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:31.100
a three-dimensional vector,
minus 3pi, minus 3 times minus

00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:37.360
2 is positive 6, and then minus
3 times 0 is just 0.

00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:39.100
So it's that straightforward.

00:15:39.100 --> 00:15:41.750
They made this fancy definition,
but it's fairly

00:15:41.750 --> 00:15:43.550
easy to deal with, I think.

00:15:43.550 --> 00:15:48.380
And I'll just make one last
definition, and I'll call that

00:15:48.380 --> 00:15:49.630
the zero vector.

00:15:54.350 --> 00:15:56.760
And depending on what dimension
we're in, it just

00:15:56.760 --> 00:15:58.240
means a vector with
all zeroes.

00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:04.150
So the zero vector in Rn, if
it's arbitrary, is just a

00:16:04.150 --> 00:16:07.010
vector where everything
is zero.

00:16:07.010 --> 00:16:09.145
And if this is Rn, you just
have n components.

00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:14.950
So those are all
my definitions.

00:16:14.950 --> 00:16:19.060
I think I've given you enough
to think about right now in

00:16:19.060 --> 00:16:19.510
this video.

00:16:19.510 --> 00:16:21.140
In the next video, I'm going
to show a bunch more of

00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:25.050
examples, and I'll actually draw
representations of these

00:16:25.050 --> 00:16:27.190
vectors, although you don't
have to, and we'll kind of

00:16:27.190 --> 00:16:28.950
have a little more visual
understanding

00:16:28.950 --> 00:16:30.680
of what they mean.
