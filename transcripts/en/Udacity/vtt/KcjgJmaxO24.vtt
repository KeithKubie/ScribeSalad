00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:03.985
Memory is sometimes taken for granted. But it's importance cannot be

00:00:03.985 --> 00:00:08.663
overstated. Memory allows us to interact successfully in our world. Through

00:00:08.663 --> 00:00:12.439
case studies such as HM, we can gain a better understanding of the areas of the

00:00:12.439 --> 00:00:18.366
brain involved in memory. We have three types of memory. Sensory memory, which

00:00:18.366 --> 00:00:22.654
includes iconic and echoic memory, short-term or working memory and long-term

00:00:22.654 --> 00:00:28.605
memory. Sensory memory is very short in duration. Working memory allows for the

00:00:28.605 --> 00:00:31.905
day to day fluidity of our actions, and long-term memory is comprised of

00:00:31.905 --> 00:00:37.255
several types of memory. Long-term memory includes declarative memory, which

00:00:37.255 --> 00:00:43.090
consists of episodic memory or memory for personal events. And semantic memory

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:47.530
which is memory for facts. In addition, we also have explicit and implicit

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:53.174
memories. The four steps in long term memory formation are encoding,

00:00:53.174 --> 00:00:58.868
consolidation, storage and retrevial. We can use schemas, associative networks,

00:00:58.868 --> 00:01:04.156
and mnemonic devices in aiding our memory efforts. Over time, we may experience

00:01:04.156 --> 00:01:08.806
forgetting and memory loss. In addition, illness and injury can also impair our

00:01:08.806 --> 00:01:13.410
memory. This can result from things such as Alzheimer's disease or dementia and

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:18.160
accidents that may result in amnesia. Some important areas of the brain

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:22.240
involved in memory include the cerebellum and striatum, the hippocampus and the

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:28.874
amygdala. Furthermore, the prefrontal cortex. Auditory cortex, visual cortex,

00:01:28.874 --> 00:01:32.690
and somatosensory cortex all play a role in memory.
