00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:05.596
So, what is computer architecture. Architecture, in the sense that

00:00:05.596 --> 00:00:09.250
we all know it, is about designing a building that

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:12.652
is well suited for its purpose. So, it could be

00:00:12.652 --> 00:00:16.044
designing, for example, an apartment building or a house and

00:00:16.044 --> 00:00:18.540
what we want is for this building to be designed

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:20.908
so that it work wells for whatever you want to

00:00:20.908 --> 00:00:23.304
use it. Like, for a family to live in or

00:00:23.304 --> 00:00:25.510
for a lot of people to live in. Or if it's

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:27.670
an office building, for a lot of offices to

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:29.710
be there and the employees to be happy and

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:33.944
so on. So, computer architecture is similar in that

00:00:33.944 --> 00:00:37.298
it is about designing a computer this time that

00:00:37.298 --> 00:00:40.824
is well suited for its purpose. So, we can

00:00:40.824 --> 00:00:43.530
have a large desktop computer, or a much smaller

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.910
laptop computer. Or even a smartphone. And we want

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:50.830
to design each of these so that they work well.

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:53.110
Maybe the desktop, because it's larger, can

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:56.310
be much more powerful. The laptop provides

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:58.900
some computational power in a much more

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:02.065
constrained space. And the phone provides us with

00:01:02.065 --> 00:01:05.298
a good battery life and it's very light weight and still provides us with

00:01:05.298 --> 00:01:07.312
some computational power that is enough to,

00:01:07.312 --> 00:01:09.260
for example, do web browsing and so on.
