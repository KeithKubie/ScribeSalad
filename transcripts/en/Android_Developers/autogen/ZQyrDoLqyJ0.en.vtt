questions like this before
 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:36.100
questions like this before
I think the first thing I would ask is

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:36.110
I think the first thing I would ask is
 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:37.960

why do you want to do that I mean I

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:37.970
why do you want to do that I mean I
 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:41.590
why do you want to do that I mean I
think that one of the most one of these

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:51.420
through the speakers so I mean you know
it seems like you you have the

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:51.430
it seems like you you have the
 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:55.450
it seems like you you have the
possibility of circumventing the basic

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:55.460
possibility of circumventing the basic
 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:57.340

contract that the device makes that says
that when you plug in your headphones

00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:58.340
that when you plug in your headphones
 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:03.790

you won't be annoying your neighbors but
 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:07.469
you won't be annoying your neighbors but
the thing is here we are actually

00:05:07.469 --> 00:05:07.479
the thing is here we are actually
 

00:05:07.479 --> 00:05:10.870
the thing is here we are actually
sending the entire audio input signal as

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:10.880
sending the entire audio input signal as
 

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:14.740
sending the entire audio input signal as
in one source while the other one are

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:14.750
in one source while the other one are

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:17.800
using as material notifications stuff
 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:21.430
using as material notifications stuff
but still when we use a notification or

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:21.440
but still when we use a notification or
 

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:26.020
but still when we use a notification or
a ring instead of a stream it's

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:26.030
a ring instead of a stream it's
 

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:27.760
a ring instead of a stream it's
interrupting the string to wait until

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:27.770
interrupting the string to wait until
 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:30.640
interrupting the string to wait until
this this audio is finished and then

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:30.650
this this audio is finished and then
 

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:32.770
this this audio is finished and then
it's it resumes the signal back again

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:32.780
it's it resumes the signal back again
 

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:35.320
it's it resumes the signal back again
and which is quite a bit not what we are

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:35.330
and which is quite a bit not what we are
 

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:43.149
and which is quite a bit not what we are
expecting I don't know if any of us are

00:05:43.149 --> 00:05:43.159
expecting I don't know if any of us are
 

00:05:43.159 --> 00:05:45.370
expecting I don't know if any of us are
really that that expert in the

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:45.380
really that that expert in the
 

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:46.839
really that that expert in the
multimedia framework I don't maybe I

00:05:46.839 --> 00:05:46.849
multimedia framework I don't maybe I
 

00:05:46.849 --> 00:05:48.939

won't speak for you guys online at night

00:05:48.939 --> 00:05:48.949
won't speak for you guys online at night
 

00:05:48.949 --> 00:05:50.950
won't speak for you guys online at night
I don't I mean technically I don't know

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:50.960
I don't I mean technically I don't know
 

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:52.719
I don't I mean technically I don't know
the answer I'm just not convinced that

00:05:52.719 --> 00:05:52.729
the answer I'm just not convinced that
 

00:05:52.729 --> 00:05:55.899
the answer I'm just not convinced that
it's a good idea maybe you guys in

00:05:55.899 --> 00:05:55.909
it's a good idea maybe you guys in
 

00:05:55.909 --> 00:05:58.719
it's a good idea maybe you guys in
London have a perspective on this no I

00:05:58.719 --> 00:05:58.729
London have a perspective on this no I
 

00:05:58.729 --> 00:05:59.950
London have a perspective on this no I
think we'd know about it if it was

00:05:59.950 --> 00:05:59.960
think we'd know about it if it was
 

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:01.749
think we'd know about it if it was
possible because you'd end up setting

00:06:01.749 --> 00:06:01.759
possible because you'd end up setting
 

00:06:01.759 --> 00:06:04.120
possible because you'd end up setting
separate volume controls for the speaker

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:04.130
separate volume controls for the speaker
 

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:08.070
separate volume controls for the speaker
to the headphones and yeah when you

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:08.080
to the headphones and yeah when you
 

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:10.210
to the headphones and yeah when you
those events that happen when you plug

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:10.220
those events that happen when you plug
 

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:11.439
those events that happen when you plug
in headphones and unplug them for

00:06:11.439 --> 00:06:11.449
in headphones and unplug them for
 

00:06:11.449 --> 00:06:13.719

example I like the music now we'll stop

00:06:13.719 --> 00:06:13.729
example I like the music now we'll stop
 

00:06:13.729 --> 00:06:17.730
example I like the music now we'll stop
playing so I know that you can get event

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:17.740
playing so I know that you can get event
 

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:20.200
playing so I know that you can get event
to tell you that events being a dinner

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:20.210
to tell you that events being a dinner
 

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:22.340
to tell you that events being a dinner
and then decide

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:22.350
and then decide
 

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:25.490
and then decide
my vision speakers probably confuse

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:25.500
my vision speakers probably confuse
 

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:26.840
my vision speakers probably confuse
users somewhat as well because they

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:26.850
users somewhat as well because they
 

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:29.090
users somewhat as well because they
would be expecting the speaker's to mute

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:29.100
would be expecting the speaker's to mute
 

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:31.910
would be expecting the speaker's to mute
it soon as they put headphones it could

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:31.920
it soon as they put headphones it could
 

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:35.330

it's just not possible or if it is

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:39.330
it's just not possible or if it is
 

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:41.420
it's just not possible or if it is
possible maybe the way to do it is to do

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:41.430
possible maybe the way to do it is to do
 

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:43.850
possible maybe the way to do it is to do
it in the NDK I mean there's you know

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:43.860
it in the NDK I mean there's you know
 

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:47.210
it in the NDK I mean there's you know

once you once you get below the the Java
 

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:49.430
once you once you get below the the Java
framework then then you can get much

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:49.440
framework then then you can get much
 

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:51.020

more direct control over the actual

that will probably work I think that

00:11:37.770 --> 00:11:37.780
that will probably work I think that
 

00:11:37.780 --> 00:11:40.620
that will probably work I think that
that when possible the Android team

00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:40.630

00:11:46.570 --> 00:11:49.410
agnostic and support rotation and if
they don't support it by default on a

00:11:49.410 --> 00:11:49.420
they don't support it by default on a
 

00:11:49.420 --> 00:11:51.150
they don't support it by default on a
particular device is probably because

00:11:51.150 --> 00:11:51.160
particular device is probably because
 

00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:53.670
particular device is probably because
they weren't able to get a user

00:11:53.670 --> 00:11:53.680
they weren't able to get a user
 

00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:55.260
they weren't able to get a user
experience that they were happy with in

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:55.270
experience that they were happy with in
 

00:11:55.270 --> 00:11:56.970
experience that they were happy with in
that orientation and so they locked it

00:11:56.970 --> 00:11:56.980
that orientation and so they locked it
 

00:11:56.980 --> 00:12:00.180
that orientation and so they locked it
out that's so my my guess there is that

00:12:00.180 --> 00:12:00.190
out that's so my my guess there is that
 

00:12:00.190 --> 00:12:03.030
out that's so my my guess there is that
if they don't support landscape on the

interpret this question as you have

00:14:07.410 --> 00:14:07.420
interpret this question as you have
 

00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:10.530
interpret this question as you have
layers of hierarchy of navigation but

00:14:10.530 --> 00:14:10.540
layers of hierarchy of navigation but
 

00:14:10.540 --> 00:14:12.390
layers of hierarchy of navigation but
instead of having separate activities it

00:14:12.390 --> 00:14:12.400
instead of having separate activities it
 

00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:13.650
instead of having separate activities it
sounds that you just have one activity

00:14:13.650 --> 00:14:13.660
sounds that you just have one activity
 

00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:15.090
sounds that you just have one activity
and you just dynamically change the

00:14:15.090 --> 00:14:15.100
and you just dynamically change the
 

00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:17.070
and you just dynamically change the
content of that one activity depending

00:14:17.070 --> 00:14:17.080
content of that one activity depending
 

00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:25.650
content of that one activity depending
on which it sounds like you're trying to

00:14:25.650 --> 00:14:25.660
on which it sounds like you're trying to
 

00:14:25.660 --> 00:14:38.760
on which it sounds like you're trying to
almost you know you just on option item

00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:38.770
almost you know you just on option item
 

00:14:38.770 --> 00:14:45.780
almost you know you just on option item
selected so you can just kind of react

00:14:45.780 --> 00:14:45.790
selected so you can just kind of react
 

00:14:45.790 --> 00:14:49.140
selected so you can just kind of react
to them as that or if you use the latest

00:14:49.140 --> 00:14:49.150
to them as that or if you use the latest
 

00:14:49.150 --> 00:14:52.860
to them as that or if you use the latest
later version of the support library if

00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:52.870
later version of the support library if
 

00:14:52.870 --> 00:14:54.030

you were to go to activities you can

00:14:54.030 --> 00:14:54.040
you were to go to activities you can
 

00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:56.550
you were to go to activities you can
provide a metadata tag saying defining

provide a metadata tag saying defining
 

00:14:56.560 --> 00:14:58.710
provide a metadata tag saying defining
the name of the parent activity so

00:14:58.710 --> 00:14:58.720
the name of the parent activity so
 

00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:00.150
the name of the parent activity so
they're all handled that up button

00:15:00.150 --> 00:15:00.160
they're all handled that up button
 

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:02.130
they're all handled that up button

I'm not quite sure what the exact

00:15:06.660 --> 00:15:06.670
I'm not quite sure what the exact
 

00:15:06.670 --> 00:15:12.120
I'm not quite sure what the exact
I take taking what you said there and

00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:12.130
I take taking what you said there and

is swapping off fragments rather than

00:15:15.930 --> 00:15:15.940
is swapping off fragments rather than
 

00:15:15.940 --> 00:15:17.250
is swapping off fragments rather than
changing the activity then you want no

00:15:17.250 --> 00:15:17.260
changing the activity then you want no
 

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:18.690
changing the activity then you want no
parent activity and you just want to

00:15:18.690 --> 00:15:18.700
parent activity and you just want to
 

00:15:18.700 --> 00:15:22.320
parent activity and you just want to
receive that that menu event that option

00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:22.330
receive that that menu event that option
 

00:15:22.330 --> 00:15:24.240
receive that that menu event that option
menu event and handle it by changing off

00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:24.250
menu event and handle it by changing off
 

00:15:24.250 --> 00:15:26.370
menu event and handle it by changing off
the fragment instead of look at yeah

00:15:26.370 --> 00:15:26.380
the fragment instead of look at yeah
 

00:15:26.380 --> 00:15:28.440
the fragment instead of look at yeah
there are some some cases where the

00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:28.450
there are some some cases where the
 

00:15:28.450 --> 00:15:32.010
there are some some cases where the
buttons overloaded and doesn't just do

00:15:32.010 --> 00:15:32.020
buttons overloaded and doesn't just do
 

00:15:32.020 --> 00:15:34.320
buttons overloaded and doesn't just do
navigation so I think the good example

00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:34.330
navigation so I think the good example
 

00:15:34.330 --> 00:15:36.810
navigation so I think the good example
here is if the expand collapse pattern

00:15:36.810 --> 00:15:36.820
here is if the expand collapse pattern
 

00:15:36.820 --> 00:15:39.180
here is if the expand collapse pattern
which is probably best demonstrated by

00:15:39.180 --> 00:15:39.190
which is probably best demonstrated by
 

00:15:39.190 --> 00:15:43.290
which is probably best demonstrated by
Gmail way to really a message kind of in

00:15:43.290 --> 00:15:43.300
Gmail way to really a message kind of in
 

00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:45.780
Gmail way to really a message kind of in
in landscape and then go to portray the

00:15:45.780 --> 00:15:45.790
in landscape and then go to portray the
 

00:15:45.790 --> 00:15:47.310
in landscape and then go to portray the
message expands to take up the entire

00:15:47.310 --> 00:15:47.320
message expands to take up the entire
 

00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:49.320
message expands to take up the entire
width of the screen and hides the kind

00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:49.330
width of the screen and hides the kind
 

00:15:49.330 --> 00:15:52.440
width of the screen and hides the kind
of sidebar with the list of messages and

00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:52.450
of sidebar with the list of messages and
 

00:15:52.450 --> 00:15:53.790
of sidebar with the list of messages and
in that instance you might use the UP

00:15:53.790 --> 00:15:53.800
in that instance you might use the UP
 

00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:56.280
in that instance you might use the UP
button there to reexpansion of the

00:15:56.280 --> 00:15:56.290
button there to reexpansion of the
 

00:15:56.290 --> 00:15:58.740
button there to reexpansion of the
content so it's not always just kind of

00:15:58.740 --> 00:15:58.750
content so it's not always just kind of
 

00:15:58.750 --> 00:16:08.010
content so it's not always just kind of
hierarchical navigation so yeah is that

00:16:08.010 --> 00:16:08.020
hierarchical navigation so yeah is that
 

00:16:08.020 --> 00:16:09.540

00:29:07.900 --> 00:29:07.910
basically as you're doing a build and
 

00:29:07.910 --> 00:29:26.610
basically as you're doing a build and
run the tests so there are other video

00:29:26.610 --> 00:29:26.620

monkey run a spirit test for you okay

00:29:37.110 --> 00:29:37.120
monkey run a spirit test for you okay
 

00:29:37.120 --> 00:29:39.760
monkey run a spirit test for you okay
and I think it was sound so we've just

00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:39.770
and I think it was sound so we've just
 

00:29:39.770 --> 00:29:41.620
and I think it was sound so we've just
opened up their own online testing that

00:29:41.620 --> 00:29:41.630
opened up their own online testing that
 

00:29:41.630 --> 00:29:43.210

00:29:55.300 --> 00:29:55.310
developer sites as well right look says
 

00:29:55.310 --> 00:29:56.800
developer sites as well right look says
that you can borrow devices from Sony

00:29:56.800 --> 00:29:56.810
that you can borrow devices from Sony
 

00:29:56.810 --> 00:30:01.630

to put the question back to you then how

00:30:12.100 --> 00:30:12.110
to put the question back to you then how
 

00:30:12.110 --> 00:30:14.530
to put the question back to you then how
do you test apps which which use like a

00:30:14.530 --> 00:30:14.540
do you test apps which which use like a
 

00:30:14.540 --> 00:30:17.460
do you test apps which which use like a
server server side back-end

00:30:17.460 --> 00:30:17.470
server server side back-end
 

00:30:17.470 --> 00:30:20.500
server server side back-end
do you and which might be intermittent

00:30:20.500 --> 00:30:20.510
do you and which might be intermittent
 

00:30:20.510 --> 00:30:26.500
do you and which might be intermittent
or so do you mock it out yeah yeah if it

00:30:26.500 --> 00:30:26.510
or so do you mock it out yeah yeah if it
 

00:30:26.510 --> 00:30:29.350
or so do you mock it out yeah yeah if it
was gonna be like a hybrid application

00:30:29.350 --> 00:30:29.360
was gonna be like a hybrid application
 

00:30:29.360 --> 00:30:33.340
was gonna be like a hybrid application
that needed testing was being built as a

00:30:33.340 --> 00:30:33.350
that needed testing was being built as a
 

00:30:33.350 --> 00:30:35.500
that needed testing was being built as a
contract work then yeah I would lock it

00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:35.510
contract work then yeah I would lock it
 

00:30:35.510 --> 00:30:37.120
contract work then yeah I would lock it
out as I was building the application so

00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:37.130
out as I was building the application so
 

00:30:37.130 --> 00:30:38.260
out as I was building the application so
I could run from the test and make sure

00:30:38.260 --> 00:30:38.270
I could run from the test and make sure
 

00:30:38.270 --> 00:30:40.810
I could run from the test and make sure
I was happy with the server side comment

00:30:40.810 --> 00:30:40.820
I was happy with the server side comment
 

00:30:40.820 --> 00:30:42.580
I was happy with the server side comment
and then test the service I can run it

00:30:42.580 --> 00:30:42.590
and then test the service I can run it
 

00:30:42.590 --> 00:30:44.530
and then test the service I can run it
separately in green or together yeah

00:30:44.530 --> 00:30:44.540
separately in green or together yeah
 

00:30:44.540 --> 00:30:47.500

or anything I just you know somebody

00:32:11.830 --> 00:32:11.840
or anything I just you know somebody

or anything I just you know somebody
asked can you do a card emulation then

00:32:13.810 --> 00:32:13.820
asked can you do a card emulation then
 

00:32:13.820 --> 00:32:27.170
asked can you do a card emulation then
the answer is evidently yes

I jumped on in person try to find a

00:32:57.780 --> 00:32:57.790
I jumped on in person try to find a
 

00:32:57.790 --> 00:33:09.780
I jumped on in person try to find a
quiet spot yeah so I've got an app I've

00:33:09.780 --> 00:33:09.790
quiet spot yeah so I've got an app I've
 

00:33:09.790 --> 00:33:12.180

got the Silva seems to be working fine

00:33:12.180 --> 00:33:12.190
got the Silva seems to be working fine

for the sort of mobile version for the

00:33:14.880 --> 00:33:14.890
for the sort of mobile version for the
 

00:33:14.890 --> 00:33:17.190
for the sort of mobile version for the
tablet version I have sort of a search

00:33:17.190 --> 00:33:17.200
tablet version I have sort of a search
 

00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:21.030
tablet version I have sort of a search
list and then when somebody performs a

00:33:21.030 --> 00:33:21.040
list and then when somebody performs a
 

00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:22.890
list and then when somebody performs a
search they get a list of results that

00:33:22.890 --> 00:33:22.900
search they get a list of results that
 

00:33:22.900 --> 00:33:25.290
search they get a list of results that
slides in and then when they sort of

00:33:25.290 --> 00:33:25.300
slides in and then when they sort of
 

00:33:25.300 --> 00:33:27.450
slides in and then when they sort of
click on a result it then slides in a

00:33:27.450 --> 00:33:27.460
click on a result it then slides in a
 

00:33:27.460 --> 00:33:29.610
click on a result it then slides in a
detail screen and that will then allow

00:33:29.610 --> 00:33:29.620
detail screen and that will then allow
 

00:33:29.620 --> 00:33:32.040
detail screen and that will then allow
them to slide in a more detailed screen

00:33:32.040 --> 00:33:32.050
them to slide in a more detailed screen
 

00:33:32.050 --> 00:33:35.250
them to slide in a more detailed screen
again after that so I wanted to do

00:33:35.250 --> 00:33:35.260
again after that so I wanted to do
 

00:33:35.260 --> 00:33:37.560
again after that so I wanted to do
something like the Gmail app which then

00:33:37.560 --> 00:33:37.570
something like the Gmail app which then
 

00:33:37.570 --> 00:33:39.120
something like the Gmail app which then
allows you to sort of navigate back

00:33:39.120 --> 00:33:39.130
allows you to sort of navigate back
 

00:33:39.130 --> 00:33:46.590
allows you to sort of navigate back
upwards mmm so great so maybe the up the

00:33:46.590 --> 00:33:46.600
upwards mmm so great so maybe the up the
 

00:33:46.600 --> 00:33:48.570
upwards mmm so great so maybe the up the
little UP button would simply close the

00:33:48.570 --> 00:33:48.580
little UP button would simply close the
 

00:33:48.580 --> 00:33:50.550
little UP button would simply close the
rightmost tab essentially or eCourse the

00:33:50.550 --> 00:33:50.560

saying about the fourth list that drops

00:33:56.970 --> 00:33:56.980
saying about the fourth list that drops
 

00:33:56.980 --> 00:34:02.670
saying about the fourth list that drops
in but that's fine so it just goes to

00:34:02.670 --> 00:34:02.680
in but that's fine so it just goes to
 

00:34:02.680 --> 00:34:05.940
in but that's fine so it just goes to
results list and then a summary detail

00:34:05.940 --> 00:34:05.950
results list and then a summary detail
 

00:34:05.950 --> 00:34:07.230
results list and then a summary detail
screen and then goes into a more

00:34:07.230 --> 00:34:07.240
screen and then goes into a more
 

00:34:07.240 --> 00:34:10.440
screen and then goes into a more
detailed screen and I'm just looking to

00:34:10.440 --> 00:34:10.450
detailed screen and I'm just looking to
 

00:34:10.450 --> 00:34:12.030
detailed screen and I'm just looking to
do something like the Gmail app where

do something like the Gmail app where
 

00:34:12.040 --> 00:34:14.580
do something like the Gmail app where
you just hit the back button it would

00:34:14.580 --> 00:34:14.590
you just hit the back button it would
 

00:34:14.590 --> 00:34:16.500
you just hit the back button it would
take you from the very tail screen to

all the fragments implement an interface

00:34:37.770 --> 00:34:37.780
all the fragments implement an interface
 

00:34:37.780 --> 00:34:44.600
all the fragments implement an interface
there cause back to that

00:34:44.600 --> 00:34:44.610
 
 

00:34:44.610 --> 00:34:46.370
 
it's that will do all the fragment

00:34:46.370 --> 00:34:46.380
it's that will do all the fragment
 

00:34:46.380 --> 00:34:48.470
it's that will do all the fragment
transactions and swap out all the

00:34:48.470 --> 00:34:48.480
transactions and swap out all the
 

00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:50.960
transactions and swap out all the
screens appropriately now where I'm

00:34:50.960 --> 00:34:50.970
screens appropriately now where I'm
 

00:34:50.970 --> 00:34:54.320
screens appropriately now where I'm
having the the issue is is obviously for

00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:54.330
having the the issue is is obviously for
 

00:34:54.330 --> 00:34:56.660
having the the issue is is obviously for

best way of having specifying I want the
 

00:35:11.190 --> 00:35:13.580
best way of having specifying I want the
the UP button to be there for every

00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:20.250
and then be how do I handle the user
 

00:35:20.250 --> 00:35:23.330

pressing the UP button but those are the

00:35:23.330 --> 00:35:23.340
pressing the UP button but those are the
 

00:35:23.340 --> 00:35:27.260
pressing the UP button but those are the
two problems that I'm facing well you

00:35:27.260 --> 00:35:27.270
two problems that I'm facing well you
 

00:35:27.270 --> 00:35:29.210
two problems that I'm facing well you
can show and hide that that Chevron

00:35:29.210 --> 00:35:29.220
can show and hide that that Chevron
 

00:35:29.220 --> 00:35:31.310
can show and hide that that Chevron
right I mean that's that's a function

00:35:31.310 --> 00:35:31.320
right I mean that's that's a function
 

00:35:31.320 --> 00:35:38.450
right I mean that's that's a function
call a method it seems to me like what

00:35:38.450 --> 00:35:38.460
call a method it seems to me like what
 

00:35:38.460 --> 00:35:41.330
call a method it seems to me like what
you just want to do is is no you're sort

00:35:41.330 --> 00:35:41.340
you just want to do is is no you're sort
 

00:35:41.340 --> 00:35:43.960
you just want to do is is no you're sort
of know your depth of you and and

00:35:43.960 --> 00:35:43.970
of know your depth of you and and
 

00:35:43.970 --> 00:35:46.480
of know your depth of you and and
anytime your depth is greater than one

00:35:46.480 --> 00:35:46.490
anytime your depth is greater than one
 

00:35:46.490 --> 00:35:49.070
anytime your depth is greater than one
close the the rightmost fragment and

00:35:49.070 --> 00:35:49.080
close the the rightmost fragment and
 

00:35:49.080 --> 00:35:51.490
close the the rightmost fragment and
decrease your depth that's kind of I

00:35:51.490 --> 00:35:51.500
decrease your depth that's kind of I
 

00:35:51.500 --> 00:35:54.410
decrease your depth that's kind of I
mean sounds like a pat answer but that's

00:35:54.410 --> 00:35:54.420
mean sounds like a pat answer but that's
 

00:35:54.420 --> 00:35:55.880
mean sounds like a pat answer but that's
what I'm seeing when I hear you describe

00:35:55.880 --> 00:35:55.890
what I'm seeing when I hear you describe
 

00:35:55.890 --> 00:35:59.960
what I'm seeing when I hear you describe
it simply you have certain states which

00:35:59.960 --> 00:35:59.970
it simply you have certain states which
 

00:35:59.970 --> 00:36:02.540
it simply you have certain states which
you get into so maybe just you know

00:36:02.540 --> 00:36:02.550
you get into so maybe just you know
 

00:36:02.550 --> 00:36:06.230
you get into so maybe just you know
define as or there's consonants and you

00:36:06.230 --> 00:36:06.240
define as or there's consonants and you
 

00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:07.970
define as or there's consonants and you
know just hold your current state and

00:36:07.970 --> 00:36:07.980
know just hold your current state and
 

00:36:07.980 --> 00:36:11.330
know just hold your current state and
you know so you can say at home button

00:36:11.330 --> 00:36:11.340
you know so you can say at home button
 

00:36:11.340 --> 00:36:12.770
you know so you can say at home button
you know and you pass in your current

00:36:12.770 --> 00:36:12.780
you know and you pass in your current
 

00:36:12.780 --> 00:36:20.390
you know and you pass in your current
state and something like that but yeah I

00:36:20.390 --> 00:36:20.400
state and something like that but yeah I
 

00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:21.200
state and something like that but yeah I
think you're basically gonna have to

00:36:21.200 --> 00:36:21.210
think you're basically gonna have to
 

00:36:21.210 --> 00:36:26.660
think you're basically gonna have to
manage it so sure would be a good

00:36:26.660 --> 00:36:26.670
manage it so sure would be a good
 

00:36:26.670 --> 00:36:30.560
manage it so sure would be a good
implementation for that I'm trying to

00:36:30.560 --> 00:36:30.570
implementation for that I'm trying to
 

00:36:30.570 --> 00:36:32.210
implementation for that I'm trying to
think if you could get some good UX by

00:36:32.210 --> 00:36:32.220
think if you could get some good UX by
 

00:36:32.220 --> 00:36:35.150
think if you could get some good UX by
by using a u a viewpager there you know

00:36:35.150 --> 00:36:35.160
by using a u a viewpager there you know
 

00:36:35.160 --> 00:36:37.820
by using a u a viewpager there you know
rather than just popping fragments in

00:36:37.820 --> 00:36:37.830
rather than just popping fragments in
 

00:36:37.830 --> 00:36:38.720
rather than just popping fragments in
and out of existence

00:36:38.720 --> 00:36:38.730
and out of existence
 

00:36:38.730 --> 00:36:43.370

I don't know sort of mulling over you

00:36:43.370 --> 00:36:43.380
I don't know sort of mulling over you
 

00:36:43.380 --> 00:36:45.560
I don't know sort of mulling over you
might be able to if you had if they

00:36:45.560 --> 00:36:45.570
might be able to if you had if they
 

00:36:45.570 --> 00:36:47.300
might be able to if you had if they
weren't taking up the entire screen that

00:36:47.300 --> 00:36:47.310
weren't taking up the entire screen that
 

00:36:47.310 --> 00:36:48.860
weren't taking up the entire screen that
could be some really weird stuff that

00:36:48.860 --> 00:36:48.870
could be some really weird stuff that
 

00:36:48.870 --> 00:36:50.930
could be some really weird stuff that
you could do with it but not sure though

00:36:50.930 --> 00:36:50.940
you could do with it but not sure though
 

00:36:50.940 --> 00:36:57.080
you could do with it but not sure though
it makes sense

00:36:57.080 --> 00:36:57.090
 
 

00:36:57.090 --> 00:37:00.240
 
yeah I'd be interesting kid you don't

00:37:00.240 --> 00:37:00.250
yeah I'd be interesting kid you don't
 

00:37:00.250 --> 00:37:01.980
yeah I'd be interesting kid you don't
know if we change the width of elements

00:37:01.980 --> 00:37:01.990

did a viewpager

00:37:03.630 --> 00:37:03.640
did a viewpager
 

00:37:03.640 --> 00:37:11.970
did a viewpager
yes or if you if you stick your

00:37:11.970 --> 00:37:11.980
yes or if you if you stick your

fragments in a linear layout can give

00:37:13.620 --> 00:37:13.630
fragments in a linear layout can give
 

00:37:13.630 --> 00:37:17.610
fragments in a linear layout can give
them layout weights no if it's in the

00:37:17.610 --> 00:37:17.620
them layout weights no if it's in the
 

00:37:17.620 --> 00:37:19.500
them layout weights no if it's in the
view you do with respect you have to use

00:37:19.500 --> 00:37:19.510
view you do with respect you have to use
 

00:37:19.510 --> 00:37:29.240
view you do with respect you have to use
a set page where check API on page oh

00:37:29.240 --> 00:37:29.250
a set page where check API on page oh
 

00:37:29.250 --> 00:37:34.500
a set page where check API on page oh
yeah that's the question yeah I think

00:37:34.500 --> 00:37:34.510
yeah that's the question yeah I think
 

00:37:34.510 --> 00:37:36.480
yeah that's the question yeah I think
essentially you're gonna have to handle

00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:36.490
essentially you're gonna have to handle
 

00:37:36.490 --> 00:37:38.340
essentially you're gonna have to handle
your own state so when you do like

00:37:38.340 --> 00:37:38.350
your own state so when you do like
 

00:37:38.350 --> 00:37:39.840
your own state so when you do like
during those callbacks you talk about so

00:37:39.840 --> 00:37:39.850
during those callbacks you talk about so
 

00:37:39.850 --> 00:37:41.220
during those callbacks you talk about so
when the fragment is talking to the

00:37:41.220 --> 00:37:41.230
when the fragment is talking to the
 

00:37:41.230 --> 00:37:42.870
when the fragment is talking to the
activity to do the fragment transactions

00:37:42.870 --> 00:37:42.880
activity to do the fragment transactions
 

00:37:42.880 --> 00:37:44.520
activity to do the fragment transactions
that's the point at which you want it

00:37:44.520 --> 00:37:44.530
that's the point at which you want it
 

00:37:44.530 --> 00:37:47.000
that's the point at which you want it
then I'll enable disable the up Chevron

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:47.010
then I'll enable disable the up Chevron
 

00:37:47.010 --> 00:37:49.800
then I'll enable disable the up Chevron
yeah so I think I've got something to do

00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:49.810
yeah so I think I've got something to do
 

00:37:49.810 --> 00:37:51.330
yeah so I think I've got something to do
that I wasn't sure it was the best way

00:37:51.330 --> 00:37:51.340
that I wasn't sure it was the best way
 

00:37:51.340 --> 00:37:53.960
that I wasn't sure it was the best way
that the other problem I'm having is

00:37:53.960 --> 00:37:53.970
that the other problem I'm having is
 

00:37:53.970 --> 00:37:57.630
that the other problem I'm having is
about the handling the user pressing the

00:37:57.630 --> 00:37:57.640
about the handling the user pressing the
 

00:37:57.640 --> 00:38:02.370
about the handling the user pressing the
ease of a button as I found various ways

00:38:02.370 --> 00:38:02.380
ease of a button as I found various ways
 

00:38:02.380 --> 00:38:05.880
ease of a button as I found various ways
online but it just jumps the users trade

00:38:05.880 --> 00:38:05.890
online but it just jumps the users trade

yes I've implemented that method I'm

00:38:27.590 --> 00:38:27.600
yes I've implemented that method I'm
 

00:38:27.600 --> 00:38:37.320
yes I've implemented that method I'm
checking for that case well my slight

00:38:37.320 --> 00:38:37.330
checking for that case well my slight

question is what what code should I be

00:38:39.240 --> 00:38:39.250
question is what what code should I be
 

00:38:39.250 --> 00:38:40.620
question is what what code should I be
putting in there because I found some

00:38:40.620 --> 00:38:40.630
putting in there because I found some
 

00:38:40.630 --> 00:38:46.440
putting in there because I found some
example code online and worked ok oh I

00:38:46.440 --> 00:38:46.450
example code online and worked ok oh I
 

00:38:46.450 --> 00:38:48.180

think I've got some slightly bad code

00:38:48.180 --> 00:38:48.190
think I've got some slightly bad code
 

00:38:48.190 --> 00:38:49.530
think I've got some slightly bad code
I've been using for the mobile stuff

00:38:49.530 --> 00:38:49.540
I've been using for the mobile stuff
 

00:38:49.540 --> 00:38:51.270
I've been using for the mobile stuff
which works fine but with the tablet

found some code about using an intent

00:38:56.130 --> 00:38:56.140
found some code about using an intent
 

00:38:56.140 --> 00:39:00.240
found some code about using an intent
and and calling an intent but that

00:39:00.240 --> 00:39:00.250
and and calling an intent but that

made you probably want to be making your
 

00:39:04.360 --> 00:39:08.490
made you probably want to be making your
own callbacks to do

00:39:08.490 --> 00:39:08.500
 
 

00:39:08.500 --> 00:39:11.940

actually watching and are there anyone I

00:48:47.150 --> 00:48:47.160
actually watching and are there anyone I
 

00:48:47.160 --> 00:48:54.230
actually watching and are there anyone I
won't so I do get one more question in

00:48:54.230 --> 00:48:54.240
won't so I do get one more question in
 

00:48:54.240 --> 00:48:56.210
won't so I do get one more question in

worked fine before jellybean but it

00:49:10.880 --> 00:49:10.890
worked fine before jellybean but it
 

00:49:10.890 --> 00:49:12.940
worked fine before jellybean but it
fails when hardware acceleration is on

00:49:12.940 --> 00:49:12.950
fails when hardware acceleration is on
 

00:49:12.950 --> 00:49:17.599
fails when hardware acceleration is on
etc etc and yeah some some canvas

00:49:17.599 --> 00:49:17.609
etc etc and yeah some some canvas
 

00:49:17.609 --> 00:49:20.240

drawing operations are not supported and

00:49:20.240 --> 00:49:20.250
drawing operations are not supported and
 

00:49:20.250 --> 00:49:21.620
drawing operations are not supported and
hardware acceleration I don't know if

00:49:21.620 --> 00:49:21.630
hardware acceleration I don't know if
 

00:49:21.630 --> 00:49:24.440
hardware acceleration I don't know if
this is one of them but every every time

00:49:24.440 --> 00:49:24.450
this is one of them but every every time
 

00:49:24.450 --> 00:49:27.160
this is one of them but every every time
I recorded something like this to to the

00:49:27.160 --> 00:49:27.170
I recorded something like this to to the
 

00:49:27.170 --> 00:49:29.599
I recorded something like this to to the
guys in the engineering team implemented

00:49:29.599 --> 00:49:29.609
guys in the engineering team implemented
 

00:49:29.609 --> 00:49:31.970
guys in the engineering team implemented
it usually Roman G he says oh yeah that

00:49:31.970 --> 00:49:31.980
it usually Roman G he says oh yeah that
 

00:49:31.980 --> 00:49:33.470
it usually Roman G he says oh yeah that
has been supported in hardware

00:49:33.470 --> 00:49:33.480
has been supported in hardware
 

00:49:33.480 --> 00:49:35.359
has been supported in hardware
acceleration just turn off hardware

00:49:35.359 --> 00:49:35.369
acceleration just turn off hardware
 

00:49:35.369 --> 00:49:37.010
acceleration just turn off hardware
acceleration in used software rendering

00:49:37.010 --> 00:49:37.020
acceleration in used software rendering
 

00:49:37.020 --> 00:49:41.660
acceleration in used software rendering
so I would say in in cases like this if

00:49:41.660 --> 00:49:41.670
so I would say in in cases like this if
 

00:49:41.670 --> 00:49:42.890
so I would say in in cases like this if
software accelerator

00:49:42.890 --> 00:49:42.900
software accelerator
 

00:49:42.900 --> 00:49:45.830
software accelerator
if software rendering is acceptable then

00:49:45.830 --> 00:49:45.840
if software rendering is acceptable then
 

00:49:45.840 --> 00:49:48.050
if software rendering is acceptable then
then just you invite the bullet and use

00:49:48.050 --> 00:49:48.060
then just you invite the bullet and use
 

00:49:48.060 --> 00:49:51.650
then just you invite the bullet and use
that otherwise we can look into it and

00:49:51.650 --> 00:49:51.660
that otherwise we can look into it and
 

00:49:51.660 --> 00:49:52.940
that otherwise we can look into it and
see if it's a bug but it's probably not

00:49:52.940 --> 00:49:52.950
see if it's a bug but it's probably not
 

00:49:52.950 --> 00:49:57.530
see if it's a bug but it's probably not
a bug so it's probably intentionally not

00:49:57.530 --> 00:49:57.540
a bug so it's probably intentionally not
 

00:49:57.540 --> 00:50:07.670
a bug so it's probably intentionally not
hardware accelerated is my guess

00:50:07.670 --> 00:50:07.680
 
 

00:50:07.680 --> 00:50:12.600
 
hey al how's it going hey guys pretty

00:50:12.600 --> 00:50:12.610
hey al how's it going hey guys pretty
 

00:50:12.610 --> 00:50:15.510
hey al how's it going hey guys pretty
good I was trying to join using a mobile

00:50:15.510 --> 00:50:15.520
good I was trying to join using a mobile
 

00:50:15.520 --> 00:50:17.640
good I was trying to join using a mobile
device but was having no luck so I

00:50:17.640 --> 00:50:17.650
device but was having no luck so I
 

00:50:17.650 --> 00:50:24.510
device but was having no luck so I
thought I'd go back to the PC I could

00:50:24.510 --> 00:50:24.520
thought I'd go back to the PC I could
 

00:50:24.520 --> 00:50:26.340
thought I'd go back to the PC I could
hear you guys but I couldn't see any

couldn't broadcast video but as you say

00:50:30.690 --> 00:50:30.700
couldn't broadcast video but as you say
 

00:50:30.700 --> 00:50:35.270
couldn't broadcast video but as you say
it's early days say wow I did get one

00:50:35.270 --> 00:50:35.280
it's early days say wow I did get one
 

00:50:35.280 --> 00:50:37.710
it's early days say wow I did get one
basically more than five second delay so

00:50:37.710 --> 00:50:37.720
basically more than five second delay so
 

00:50:37.720 --> 00:50:40.350

it was wanting to report a application

00:50:40.350 --> 00:50:40.360
it was wanting to report a application
 

00:50:40.360 --> 00:50:41.730
it was wanting to report a application
not responding so I put that through

00:50:41.730 --> 00:50:41.740
not responding so I put that through

hopefully yeah things will get better

00:50:43.770 --> 00:50:43.780
hopefully yeah things will get better
 

00:50:43.780 --> 00:50:51.690

are you just hanging out I'm just
 

00:50:54.160 --> 00:50:56.430
are you just hanging out I'm just
hanging out and I've been playing with

00:50:56.430 --> 00:50:56.440
hanging out and I've been playing with
 

00:50:56.440 --> 00:50:59.010
hanging out and I've been playing with
the multi-window stuff on the Samsung

00:51:07.720 --> 00:51:09.540
potentially could appear in a future
version of Android if I guess all the

00:51:09.540 --> 00:51:09.550
version of Android if I guess all the
 

00:51:09.550 --> 00:51:11.580
version of Android if I guess all the
legal guys work it out and it's all

00:51:11.580 --> 00:51:11.590
legal guys work it out and it's all
 

00:51:11.590 --> 00:51:13.770
legal guys work it out and it's all
deemed acceptable so could be useful

00:51:13.770 --> 00:51:13.780
deemed acceptable so could be useful
 

00:51:13.780 --> 00:51:23.820
deemed acceptable so could be useful
that was a bit of technology yeah

00:51:23.820 --> 00:51:23.830
that was a bit of technology yeah
 

00:51:23.830 --> 00:51:26.130
that was a bit of technology yeah
basically splits the 10-inch screen in

00:51:26.130 --> 00:51:26.140
basically splits the 10-inch screen in
 

00:51:26.140 --> 00:51:28.980
basically splits the 10-inch screen in
two so when you've got it in landscape

00:51:28.980 --> 00:51:28.990
two so when you've got it in landscape
 

00:51:28.990 --> 00:51:30.960
two so when you've got it in landscape
mode you can have one app on the left

00:51:30.960 --> 00:51:30.970
mode you can have one app on the left
 

00:51:30.970 --> 00:51:33.090
mode you can have one app on the left
and one app on the right and they get

00:51:33.090 --> 00:51:33.100
and one app on the right and they get
 

00:51:33.100 --> 00:51:35.220
and one app on the right and they get
equal spacing but it's only for a

00:51:35.220 --> 00:51:35.230
equal spacing but it's only for a
 

00:51:35.230 --> 00:51:38.940
equal spacing but it's only for a
certain select few applications which

00:51:38.940 --> 00:51:38.950
certain select few applications which
 

00:51:38.950 --> 00:51:41.490
certain select few applications which
are part of the stock firmware the

00:51:41.490 --> 00:51:41.500
are part of the stock firmware the
 

00:51:41.500 --> 00:51:42.990
are part of the stock firmware the
reason behind that is there's a lot of

00:51:42.990 --> 00:51:43.000
reason behind that is there's a lot of
 

00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:45.690
reason behind that is there's a lot of
private api's that are used to firstly

00:51:45.690 --> 00:51:45.700
private api's that are used to firstly
 

00:51:45.700 --> 00:51:47.220
private api's that are used to firstly
detect whether it's present that's the

00:51:47.220 --> 00:51:47.230
detect whether it's present that's the
 

00:51:47.230 --> 00:51:49.500
detect whether it's present that's the
functionality to do two apps on screen

00:51:49.500 --> 00:51:49.510
functionality to do two apps on screen
 

00:51:49.510 --> 00:51:51.090
functionality to do two apps on screen
at once it's present and secondly

00:51:51.090 --> 00:51:51.100
at once it's present and secondly
 

00:51:51.100 --> 00:51:53.190
at once it's present and secondly
actually to implement the switch between

actually to implement the switch between
 

00:51:53.200 --> 00:51:55.170
actually to implement the switch between

just got so my concern like I said not

00:52:09.570 --> 00:52:09.580
just got so my concern like I said not
 

00:52:09.580 --> 00:52:11.730
just got so my concern like I said not
paper that I I've only seen this is all

00:52:11.730 --> 00:52:11.740
paper that I I've only seen this is all
 

00:52:11.740 --> 00:52:17.250
paper that I I've only seen this is all
based on the Burgess video yeah look

00:52:17.250 --> 00:52:17.260
based on the Burgess video yeah look
 

00:52:17.260 --> 00:52:18.599
based on the Burgess video yeah look
like one app was cut

00:52:18.599 --> 00:52:18.609
like one app was cut
 

00:52:18.609 --> 00:52:21.089
like one app was cut
someone and upwards kind of running so

00:52:21.089 --> 00:52:21.099
someone and upwards kind of running so
 

00:52:21.099 --> 00:52:22.589
someone and upwards kind of running so
that if you try to switch back and forth

00:52:22.589 --> 00:52:22.599
that if you try to switch back and forth
 

00:52:22.599 --> 00:52:23.809
that if you try to switch back and forth
they'll be like it

00:52:23.809 --> 00:52:23.819
they'll be like it
 

00:52:23.819 --> 00:52:26.069
they'll be like it
Jonah while it kind of might unpause the

00:52:26.069 --> 00:52:26.079
Jonah while it kind of might unpause the

application you find it and you went

00:52:27.450 --> 00:52:27.460
application you find it and you went
 

00:52:27.460 --> 00:52:31.259
application you find it and you went
back to it when it had it from what I

00:52:31.259 --> 00:52:31.269
back to it when it had it from what I
 

00:52:31.269 --> 00:52:34.380
back to it when it had it from what I
can see the juddered doesn't seem to be

00:52:34.380 --> 00:52:34.390
can see the juddered doesn't seem to be
 

00:52:34.390 --> 00:52:36.299
can see the juddered doesn't seem to be
noticeable it may be the only ones

00:52:36.299 --> 00:52:36.309
noticeable it may be the only ones
 

00:52:36.309 --> 00:52:37.829
noticeable it may be the only ones
active at any one time and certainly

00:52:37.829 --> 00:52:37.839
active at any one time and certainly

active at any one time and certainly
when dialogues pop up they can be modal

00:52:40.410 --> 00:52:40.420
when dialogues pop up they can be modal
 

00:52:40.420 --> 00:52:41.970
when dialogues pop up they can be modal
dialogues you can't switch to the other

of them it takes control of the whole

00:52:45.630 --> 00:52:45.640
of them it takes control of the whole

screen it's it may be pausing it I would

00:52:50.130 --> 00:52:50.140
screen it's it may be pausing it I would
 

00:52:50.140 --> 00:52:52.799
screen it's it may be pausing it I would
suspect it is but it's nothing that's

00:52:52.799 --> 00:52:52.809
suspect it is but it's nothing that's
 

00:52:52.809 --> 00:52:54.390
suspect it is but it's nothing that's
sort of a severe judder on motor

00:52:54.390 --> 00:52:54.400
sort of a severe judder on motor
 

00:52:54.400 --> 00:52:56.069
sort of a severe judder on motor
switches I guess that's something that

00:52:56.069 --> 00:52:56.079
switches I guess that's something that
 

00:52:56.079 --> 00:52:57.390
switches I guess that's something that
they've sorted out recently because

00:52:57.390 --> 00:52:57.400
they've sorted out recently because
 

00:52:57.400 --> 00:52:59.370
they've sorted out recently because
there was one firmware update I've had

00:52:59.370 --> 00:52:59.380
there was one firmware update I've had
 

00:52:59.380 --> 00:53:07.589
there was one firmware update I've had
fritz so far they are using the Android

00:53:07.589 --> 00:53:07.599
fritz so far they are using the Android
 

00:53:07.599 --> 00:53:14.809
fritz so far they are using the Android
namespace yeah they've used Android SCC

00:53:14.809 --> 00:53:14.819
namespace yeah they've used Android SCC
 

00:53:14.819 --> 00:53:17.039

Samsung Electric Corporation so they're

00:53:17.039 --> 00:53:17.049
Samsung Electric Corporation so they're
 

00:53:17.049 --> 00:53:18.660
Samsung Electric Corporation so they're
trying to tuck it away in their own

00:53:18.660 --> 00:53:18.670
trying to tuck it away in their own
 

00:53:18.670 --> 00:53:20.849

actual multi window window manager is

00:53:23.819 --> 00:53:23.829
actual multi window window manager is
 

00:53:23.829 --> 00:53:25.979
actual multi window window manager is
very similar to the window manager that

00:53:25.979 --> 00:53:25.989
very similar to the window manager that
 

00:53:25.989 --> 00:53:28.979
very similar to the window manager that
already exists in Android so my from

00:53:28.979 --> 00:53:28.989
already exists in Android so my from
 

00:53:28.989 --> 00:53:30.749

looking at the s3 firmer as well it

00:53:30.749 --> 00:53:30.759
looking at the s3 firmer as well it
 

00:53:30.759 --> 00:53:32.759
looking at the s3 firmer as well it
looks very much like they're using this

00:53:32.759 --> 00:53:32.769
looks very much like they're using this
 

00:53:32.769 --> 00:53:35.519
looks very much like they're using this
as a base part of all of their Ice Cream

00:53:35.519 --> 00:53:35.529

Sandwich and jelly bean firmware and

00:53:37.339 --> 00:53:37.349
Sandwich and jelly bean firmware and
 

00:53:37.349 --> 00:53:40.049
Sandwich and jelly bean firmware and
this is why I think it's a potential for

00:53:40.049 --> 00:53:40.059
this is why I think it's a potential for
 

00:53:40.059 --> 00:53:41.460
this is why I think it's a potential for
being up streamed and putting into the

00:53:41.460 --> 00:53:41.470
being up streamed and putting into the
 

00:53:41.470 --> 00:53:43.589
being up streamed and putting into the
AOSP at some point because the way it's

00:53:43.589 --> 00:53:43.599
AOSP at some point because the way it's
 

00:53:43.599 --> 00:53:45.569
AOSP at some point because the way it's
written it wouldn't involve a lot of

00:53:45.569 --> 00:53:45.579
written it wouldn't involve a lot of
 

00:53:45.579 --> 00:53:48.690
written it wouldn't involve a lot of
changes for most applications to make

00:53:48.690 --> 00:53:48.700
changes for most applications to make
 

00:53:48.700 --> 00:54:05.309
changes for most applications to make
use of it new configuration changes it

00:54:05.309 --> 00:54:05.319
use of it new configuration changes it

you've got an orientation rotation you
 

00:54:15.549 --> 00:54:21.979
you've got an orientation rotation you
know had those quite drastic changes in

well-written apps should be able to
 

00:54:56.860 --> 00:54:58.860
well-written apps should be able to

00:55:01.080 --> 00:55:01.090
huge change in dimensions that was
 

00:55:01.090 --> 00:55:02.670
huge change in dimensions that was
present when you were using things like

00:55:02.670 --> 00:55:02.680
present when you were using things like
 

00:55:02.680 --> 00:55:04.380
present when you were using things like
the p-series and the pad phone and stuff

00:55:04.380 --> 00:55:04.390
the p-series and the pad phone and stuff
 

00:55:04.390 --> 00:55:07.860

like that I mean yeah I'll be

00:55:07.860 --> 00:55:07.870
like that I mean yeah I'll be
 

00:55:07.870 --> 00:55:12.420
like that I mean yeah I'll be
interesting to see how it goes I was

00:55:12.420 --> 00:55:12.430
interesting to see how it goes I was
 

00:55:12.430 --> 00:55:14.670
interesting to see how it goes I was
it's one of those things that I've been

00:55:14.670 --> 00:55:14.680
it's one of those things that I've been
 

00:55:14.680 --> 00:55:16.920
it's one of those things that I've been
working with some devices that you do

00:55:16.920 --> 00:55:16.930
working with some devices that you do
 

00:55:16.930 --> 00:55:19.320

TVs and when you've got the space of a

00:55:19.330 --> 00:55:22.320
TVs and when you've got the space of a
TV having two apps on screen at once is

00:55:22.320 --> 00:55:22.330
TV having two apps on screen at once is
 

00:55:22.330 --> 00:55:24.510
TV having two apps on screen at once is
quite possible so it was interesting to

00:55:24.510 --> 00:55:24.520
quite possible so it was interesting to
 

00:55:24.520 --> 00:55:25.680
quite possible so it was interesting to
see whether it could be an Android

00:55:25.680 --> 00:55:25.690
see whether it could be an Android
 

00:55:25.690 --> 00:55:28.470
see whether it could be an Android
driven device and do those two things on

00:55:28.470 --> 00:55:28.480
driven device and do those two things on
 

00:55:28.480 --> 00:55:44.910
driven device and do those two things on
screen at once on the same sort of basis

00:55:44.910 --> 00:55:44.920
screen at once on the same sort of basis
 

00:55:44.920 --> 00:55:47.430
screen at once on the same sort of basis
at the same time it would be brilliant

00:55:47.430 --> 00:55:47.440
at the same time it would be brilliant

at the same time it would be brilliant

at the moment all that happens is when
you select multi-screen you get the

00:55:51.330 --> 00:55:51.340
you select multi-screen you get the
 

00:55:51.340 --> 00:55:53.310
you select multi-screen you get the
drop-down list of like five or six apps

00:55:53.310 --> 00:55:53.320
drop-down list of like five or six apps
 

00:55:53.320 --> 00:55:54.810
drop-down list of like five or six apps
and you select which other one you want

00:55:54.810 --> 00:55:54.820
and you select which other one you want
