00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.240
Here's an activity diagram you can think of it executing as follows.

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:08.029
Imagine that you had some token that you could lay on top of any of

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:09.470
the states on the diagram.

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:14.160
It would come in at the start at the top where there's the filled in circle, and

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.720
it would move along the horizontal line to get to the first state.

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.240
And then it would move downward to the diamond. At which point it would split.

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.990
That is, we'd have two tokens. One going over to the right and

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.740
one going downward. The one on the right can continue downward again and

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:33.670
finally coming into the diamond near the bottom. The second token from the top

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:38.330
goes straight downward and is thwarted by the horizontal, the heavy,

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:42.260
black horizontal bar that's there. This is a synchronization point.

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.510
In this case there's nothing to synchronize with, but there are two lines coming

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:51.140
out of the bottom. Those two lines will themselves both have a copy of the token

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.160
on them, one will go over to the left into the two activities that are there,

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.400
the second will go straight downward, and eventually those two paths will merge

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:04.209
into the second horizontal line which is a synchronization point. You can think

00:01:04.209 --> 00:01:10.280
of those two paths, each having their own tokens, as running independently, and

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.530
the horizontal bar at the bottom being a kind of a gate which only opens with

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:19.050
both tokens have arrived from the top, hence synchronizing those activities.

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:23.690
At the point at which the gate opens the two tokens are merged together,

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:27.590
the single token goes out of the bottom into the diamond, and

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:30.650
the diamond is essentially a joint point, which, once again,

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:34.730
combines the two tokens and proceeds on then to the last state, and

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:36.500
the final state at the very bottom of the screen.
