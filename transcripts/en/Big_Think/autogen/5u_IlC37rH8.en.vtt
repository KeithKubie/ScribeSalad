now that the facts are that very
conservatively measured very

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:28.670
conservatively measured very
 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:30.250
conservatively measured very
conservative measure would say we have

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:30.260
conservative measure would say we have
 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.409
conservative measure would say we have
probably 50,000 people in slavery in the

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:32.419
probably 50,000 people in slavery in the
 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:34.119
probably 50,000 people in slavery in the

United States and some people would put
 

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:36.639
United States and some people would put
that number much higher but what we also

00:00:36.639 --> 00:00:36.649
that number much higher but what we also
 

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:38.950
that number much higher but what we also
know is that the number of people who

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:38.960
know is that the number of people who
 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.860
know is that the number of people who
are enslaved in sexual exploitation into

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:41.870
are enslaved in sexual exploitation into
 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:44.229

prostitution is less than half of that
 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:46.660
prostitution is less than half of that
total to the best of our understanding

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:46.670
total to the best of our understanding
 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:49.000
total to the best of our understanding
now again it's a hidden crime it's a

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.010
now again it's a hidden crime it's a
 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:51.759
now again it's a hidden crime it's a
criminal you know episode so it's hard

00:00:51.759 --> 00:00:51.769
criminal you know episode so it's hard
 

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:53.649
criminal you know episode so it's hard
to get the tight numbers but to the best

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:53.659
to get the tight numbers but to the best
 

00:00:53.659 --> 00:00:55.509
to get the tight numbers but to the best
of our understanding and so what that

00:00:55.509 --> 00:00:55.519
of our understanding and so what that
 

00:00:55.519 --> 00:00:59.200
of our understanding and so what that
means is that slavery exists all around

00:00:59.200 --> 00:00:59.210
means is that slavery exists all around
 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:01.389
means is that slavery exists all around

us in the United States and people tend
to be very unaware of it and and and

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:04.640
to be very unaware of it and and and
 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.430
to be very unaware of it and and and
literally it could be in in your

treatment and a perfect example of this

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750
treatment and a perfect example of this
 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.100
treatment and a perfect example of this
is that the State Department suggests

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110
is that the State Department suggests

are brought into the country every year
to be slaves trafficking victims 17,000

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980
to be slaves trafficking victims 17,000

getting no attention and that's that's
one of the things we've got to do to

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900
one of the things we've got to do to
 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:19.099
