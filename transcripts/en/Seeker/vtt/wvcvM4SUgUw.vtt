00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:02.690
OH “THAT TIME OF THE MONTH” …. IT IS
WHAT IT IS.

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:06.050
BUT DID YOU KNOW MOST MAMMALS DON’T EVEN
HAVE PERIODS?!

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:08.560
HUMANS ARE THE EXCEPTION- NOT THE RULE.

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:14.980
IT’S REALLY NOT FAIR.

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:19.359
HEY GUYS I’M SAPNA HERE AT D-NEWS
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT PERIODS TODAY- BUT ALL

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:22.460
OF YOU MEN AND BOYS OUT THERE--- I HOPE YOU’LL
STAY WITH ME!

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.310
CUZ LET’S FACE IT- MENSTRUATION IS A MYSTERY...

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:26.310
FOR ALL OF US.

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.759
SO, THE POINT OF THE MENSTRUAL CYCLE IS TO
PREP THE UTERUS FOR PREGNANCY.

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:35.370
EVERY MONTH OUR REPRODUCTIVE HORMONES RISE
ON CUE AND STIMULATE THE LINING OF THE UTERUS

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.390
TO BUILD UP - it’s called the endometrium
… And it's job is to CREATE A CUSHION OF

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.640
BLOOD VESSELS WHERE AN EMBRYO CAN IMPLANT
AND GROW.

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.530
BUT IF YOU DON’T GET PREGNANT, YOU DON’T
NEED THAT LINING SO YOUR BODY GETS RID OF

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.290
IT- THAT’S WHAT WE CALL MENSTRUATION.

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:54.030
MOST MAMMALS STILL HAVE A CYCLE OF OVULATION,
BUT IF THEY DON'T GET PREGNANT THEIR LINING

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.100
IS SIMPLY RE-ABSORBED BY THE BODY.

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.160
THAT’S IT.

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.220
NO OUTWARD BLEEDING WHATSOEVER

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:04.460
SOME ANIMALS WHICH ARE CLOSELY RELATED TO
US DO HAVE PERIODS LIKE CHIMPANZEES, orangutans,

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:06.240
AND RHESUS MONKEYS.

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.079
BUT THE ONLY OTHER MAMMAL RELIABLY REPORTED
TO SHOW MENSTRUATION ACCORDING TO THE AMERICAN

00:01:11.079 --> 00:01:13.969
JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY ARE BATS.

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:15.259
YEA- BATS!

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:19.869
HOWEVER, THERE IS SOME EVIDENCE THAT THE ELEPHANT
SHREW MAY ALSO HAVE PERIODS.

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:21.680
THEY'RE KINDA CUTE RIGHT?

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.450
BY THE WAY YOU MIGHT REMEMBER YOUR DOG OR
CAT HAVING WHAT YOU THOUGHT WAS A PERIOD BUT,

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:27.670
THEY’RE IN HEAT, AND THAT'S NOT THE SAME.

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:31.979
BUT WE HUMANS HAVE PERIODS EVERY MONTH WE
LOSE IRON AND NUTRIENTS DURING THAT MONTHLY

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:32.979
FLOW…

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:36.580
WHY CAN’T WE JUST RE-ABSORB OUR UTERINE
LINING LIKE MOST OF OUR ANIMAL FRIENDS?

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:40.859
WELL FIRST, IT’S THOUGHT OUR ENDOMETRIUM
IS THICKER THAN MOST SPECIES.

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:43.170
THAT MEANS THERE MAY JUST BE TOO MUCH OF IT
TO RE-ABSORB…

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.549
SO IT COMES OUT.

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.789
BUT THERE ARE 2 BIGGER QUESTIONS…

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:50.140
IS THERE AN EVOLUTIONARY BENEFIT TO THAT MONTHLY
FLOW?

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.729
AND WHY GO THROUGH THIS MADNESS EVERY MONTH
ANYWAY?!

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:58.090
WHY NOT JUST KEEP THE UTERINE LINING ALL THE
TIME WHETHER YOU GET PREGNANT OR NOT?

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.420
RESEARCHERS HAVE BEEN TRYING TO EXPLAIN THIS
FOR A LONG TIME.

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.630
THEORIES HAVE SAID PERIODS FLUSH TOXINS OUT
OF THE UTERUS AND ONE SUPER-CONTROVERSIAL

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:10.300
THEORY SAID IT CLEANED OUT BACTERIA BROUGHT
IN BY SPERM, BUT THESE AREN'T REALLY SUPPORTED

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:11.470
BY SCIENCE.

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:16.990
IN 1996 AN ANTHROPOLOGIST PUBLISHED A STUDY
IN THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY THAT SAID

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:22.300
GETTING RID OF THE UTERINE LINING EVERY MONTH
CONSUMES LESS METABOLIC ENERGY THAN CONSTANTLY

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:23.540
MAINTAINING IT.

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.170
BUT OTHERS SAY THAT'S NOT TRUE EITHER -- IT
ACTUALLY TAKES “MORE” ENERGY.

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:32.980
AND, THEN RESEARCH PUBLISHED IN BIO-ESSAYS
IN 2012, CLAIMED IT'S ALL ABOUT GENETICS AND

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.740
THERE’S NO REAL BENEFIT TO HAVING PERIODS
AT ALL.

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:41.560
INSTEAD, PERIODS ARE JUST THE INEVITABLE CONSEQUENCE
OF SOMETHING CALLED DECIDUALIZATION.

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:46.440
DECIDUALIZATION BASICALLY MEANS THE UTERINE
LINING IN HUMANS DEVELOPS INTO MORE SPECIALIZED

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:51.500
CELLS WHICH ARE READY TO IMPLANT AN EGG -- AND
FOR SOME REASON, WHEN THERE’S NO PREGNANCY,

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.250
THE CELLS ARE AUTOMATICALLY PROGRAMMED TO
SHED.

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:55.250
BUT WHY?

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:57.760
HONESTLY, SCIENTISTS ARE STILL LOOKING INTO
IT.

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:02.930
EVEN THOUGH THIS HAPPENS TO EVERY WOMAN EVERY
MONTH, IT STILL REMAINS A MYSTERY.

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:23.620
MORE RESEARCH 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:37.470
IS DEFINITELY NEEDED.
