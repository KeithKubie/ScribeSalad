you have one line or just a couple lies

00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:05.490
you have one line or just a couple lies
 

00:09:05.490 --> 00:09:06.949
you have one line or just a couple lies
you can put a lot more emphasis and

00:09:06.949 --> 00:09:06.959
you can put a lot more emphasis and
 

00:09:06.959 --> 00:09:09.290
you can put a lot more emphasis and
focus out to make them sound funny yeah

00:09:09.290 --> 00:09:09.300
focus out to make them sound funny yeah
 

00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:11.119
focus out to make them sound funny yeah
but we have a whole episode it's much

00:09:11.119 --> 00:09:11.129
but we have a whole episode it's much
 

00:09:11.129 --> 00:09:13.340

harder to make the deliveries fine

00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:13.350
harder to make the deliveries fine
 

00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:14.780
harder to make the deliveries fine
because you don't have as much time it's

00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:14.790
because you don't have as much time it's
 

00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:16.910
because you don't have as much time it's
like cuts onion you as may takes on this

00:09:16.910 --> 00:09:16.920
like cuts onion you as may takes on this
 

00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:17.900
like cuts onion you as may takes on this
line because I have to do this line

00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:17.910
line because I have to do this line
 

00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:21.019

maybe it's just a very particular kind

00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:23.310
maybe it's just a very particular kind
 

00:09:23.310 --> 00:09:26.059
maybe it's just a very particular kind
of delivery or amount of time that she

00:09:26.059 --> 00:09:26.069
of delivery or amount of time that she
 

00:09:26.069 --> 00:09:28.340
