00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:15.390
Let's say I have
the number 905.074.

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:16.970
So how could I expand this out?

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:19.390
And what does this
actually represent?

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:22.790
So let's just think about
each of the place values here.

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:26.550
The 9 right over here, this
is in the hundreds place.

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.050
This literally
represents nine hundreds.

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:32.939
So we could rewrite
that 9 as nine hundreds.

00:00:32.939 --> 00:00:33.980
Let me write it two ways.

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:35.560
We could write it
as 900, which is

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:40.230
the same thing as 9 times 100.

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.300
Now, there's a 0.

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.240
That's just going to
represent zero tens.

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:45.637
But zero tens is still just 0.

00:00:45.637 --> 00:00:47.470
So we don't have to
really worry about that.

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:51.660
It's not adding any value to
our expression or to our number.

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.290
Now we have this 5.

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:54.910
This 5 is in the ones place.

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:56.990
It literally
represents five ones,

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:58.859
or you could just
say it represents 5.

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.650
Now, if we wanted to
write it as five ones,

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:05.060
we could say well, that's
going to be 5 times 1.

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:09.540
So far, we've represented
905, 900 plus 5 or 9 times

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.601
100 plus 5 times 1.

00:01:11.601 --> 00:01:13.100
And you might say
hey, how do I know

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.074
whether I should
multiply or add first?

00:01:15.074 --> 00:01:17.490
Should I do this addition
before I do this multiplication?

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.217
And I'll always remind
you, order of operations.

00:01:20.217 --> 00:01:22.300
In this scenario, you would
do your multiplication

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:23.470
before you do your addition.

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:26.730
So you would multiply your 5
times 1 and your 9 times 100

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:29.450
before adding these
two things together.

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:30.310
But let's move on.

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:31.450
You have another 0.

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:34.480
This 0 is in the tenths place.

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:38.250
This is telling us the number
of tenths we're going to have.

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.990
This is zero tenths, so
it's really not adding much,

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:43.340
or it's not adding anything.

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:44.756
Now we go to the
hundredths place.

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.970
So this literally
represents seven hundredths.

00:01:51.970 --> 00:02:03.230
So we could write this as
7/100, or 7 times 1/100.

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:06.320
And then finally, we go
to the thousandths place.

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.520
So we go to the
thousandths place.

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.430
And we have four thousandths.

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:21.370
So that literally represents 4
over 1,000, or 4 times 1/1000.

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:26.160
Notice this is coming
from the hundreds place.

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.569
You have zero tens, but I'll
write the tens place there

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:29.360
just so you see it.

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.400
So it's zero tens, so I didn't
even bother to write that down.

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.170
Then you have your ones place.

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:35.650
You have five ones.

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:36.970
Then you have zero tenths.

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:38.470
So I didn't write that down.

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.100
Then you have seven
hundredths and then

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:43.183
you have four thousandths.

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.850
And we are done.

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:49.610
We've written this out,
really just understanding

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:51.535
what this number represents.
