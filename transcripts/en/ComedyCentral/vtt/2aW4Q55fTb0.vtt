00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:01.801
My opponent tonight
is Cameron Esposito

00:00:01.835 --> 00:00:03.302
who just released
her new comedy special,

00:00:03.335 --> 00:00:05.705
the proceeds of which
she's donating to charity.

00:00:05.738 --> 00:00:08.207
Comedy doing good in the world?
I just don't see it.

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:09.442
Cameron Esposito, everybody.

00:00:09.475 --> 00:00:11.310
-Welcome. -Yeah!
-(applause and cheering)

00:00:11.343 --> 00:00:13.312
-Welcome.
-Thank you so much, Jordan.

00:00:13.345 --> 00:00:15.815
-Happy Pride Month to you.
Yeah. -It is?

00:00:15.848 --> 00:00:17.316
I'm always prideful
to be in America, so, uh...

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:18.551
Right. No, but...

00:00:18.584 --> 00:00:20.153
-This... -...to me,
it's always Pride Month.

00:00:20.186 --> 00:00:22.655
Well, but this one's
 really Pride Month, so...

00:00:22.688 --> 00:00:24.290
Yeah, I like to think they're
all really prideful, huh?

00:00:24.323 --> 00:00:25.391
No, this is the one, though.

00:00:25.424 --> 00:00:26.859
You think
this is the special month.

00:00:26.892 --> 00:00:28.394
-This is the special month.
-Well, I'm happy.

00:00:28.427 --> 00:00:29.829
-That's good.
-Yes, thank you.

00:00:29.862 --> 00:00:31.831
-Yes. Happy Pride Month.
-Thank you. Yeah.

00:00:31.864 --> 00:00:33.566
I want to talk
about your special.

00:00:33.599 --> 00:00:35.568
It's got quite the name.

00:00:35.601 --> 00:00:37.870
Your comedy special is called...

00:00:37.903 --> 00:00:40.540
It's called... Rape Jokes.

00:00:40.573 --> 00:00:42.408
-Yeah, that's what it's called.
-That is what it's called.

00:00:42.441 --> 00:00:43.576
That's what it's called.

00:00:43.609 --> 00:00:44.844
I thought we weren't supposed

00:00:44.877 --> 00:00:46.312
to talk about those things
anymore.

00:00:46.345 --> 00:00:48.314
Well, no,
we can talk about them.

00:00:48.347 --> 00:00:50.850
I mean, we should also joke
about everything.

00:00:50.883 --> 00:00:52.985
-Um, I am... -That's what
I've been telling people.

00:00:53.018 --> 00:00:54.554
-Yeah, just be good at it.
-Oh, okay. Well, I...

00:00:54.587 --> 00:00:55.755
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-Okay, okay.

00:00:55.788 --> 00:00:57.056
-That's the difference.
-Okay. All right.

00:00:57.089 --> 00:00:59.058
I mean maybe you can't
tell rape jokes,

00:00:59.091 --> 00:01:03.663
but, like, I'm a very talented
comic, and I can.

00:01:03.696 --> 00:01:05.865
Okay. All right, I'm starting
to see where the line is here.

00:01:05.898 --> 00:01:08.301
-Yeah. -So, what is
telling a good rape joke?

00:01:08.334 --> 00:01:09.702
What does that mean?

00:01:09.735 --> 00:01:11.604
Well, I think, if you're talking
about a taboo subject

00:01:11.637 --> 00:01:13.973
or something that really affects
real people,

00:01:14.006 --> 00:01:16.209
you have to give it weight,
and you have to expect

00:01:16.242 --> 00:01:18.144
that there's going to be
survivors in your audience.

00:01:18.177 --> 00:01:19.645
I'm a survivor
of sexual assault.

00:01:19.678 --> 00:01:21.914
When I talk about it, I talk
about personal experience.

00:01:21.947 --> 00:01:23.983
I'm very funny, but I'm also
very real, and that's what

00:01:24.016 --> 00:01:26.619
I would just ask for
from other comics is like,

00:01:26.652 --> 00:01:29.989
"Hey, um,
can you tell a good joke?"

00:01:30.022 --> 00:01:31.357
How do...
how do they respond to that?

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:33.626
They love that.
They love that.

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.028
-You know, men love
to be challenged. -That's...

00:01:36.061 --> 00:01:38.431
-Really? -And when I say that,
I'm usually talking to a man.

00:01:38.464 --> 00:01:41.334
And men especially love
to be challenged by lesbians.

00:01:41.367 --> 00:01:43.336
-(laughter)
-It's a...

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:45.872
It's a good challenge
for a lot of men.

00:01:45.905 --> 00:01:48.875
So why... why...
why deal with this now?

00:01:48.908 --> 00:01:51.077
This has been...
Your special has been lauded

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.347
as the most important special
in the #MeToo era.

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:55.815
Why is this important now?

00:01:55.848 --> 00:01:59.185
Well, for me,
I remember the moment

00:01:59.218 --> 00:02:02.021
that I heard the person
who is currently president speak

00:02:02.054 --> 00:02:03.322
-about women...
-Mm-hmm.

00:02:03.355 --> 00:02:04.824
...and the way
that he behaves toward women.

00:02:04.857 --> 00:02:06.559
It was very dehumanizing.

00:02:06.592 --> 00:02:08.294
I felt like an object.

00:02:08.327 --> 00:02:09.829
I felt like a goal for him.

00:02:09.862 --> 00:02:12.165
It turns out
we are 51% of the population.

00:02:12.198 --> 00:02:14.634
And I have thought
about that moment ever since.

00:02:14.667 --> 00:02:16.836
What's interesting...
You-you-you...

00:02:16.869 --> 00:02:18.504
Your special does also talk

00:02:18.537 --> 00:02:20.173
a little bit
about the comedy community.

00:02:20.206 --> 00:02:21.908
You talk
about other male comedians.

00:02:21.941 --> 00:02:24.110
Uh,
talking about sexual assault,

00:02:24.143 --> 00:02:26.979
talking about rape in general,
and then who get upset

00:02:27.012 --> 00:02:29.582
because, uh,
they feel that they're infringed

00:02:29.615 --> 00:02:31.584
by other people saying
 they can't tell those jokes.

00:02:31.617 --> 00:02:32.952
Like, where is the line?

00:02:32.985 --> 00:02:34.620
Who is being the snowflake here?

00:02:34.653 --> 00:02:38.090
Well, I think that anybody
who can't take feedback

00:02:38.123 --> 00:02:41.360
is probably, like,
not a great artist.

00:02:41.393 --> 00:02:43.696
Like, tell a good joke.
Tell a joke

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:46.399
that doesn't do harm.
Have a point. Have...

00:02:46.432 --> 00:02:47.900
Move the conversation further.

00:02:47.933 --> 00:02:50.136
Be an artist who cares enough
about your art

00:02:50.169 --> 00:02:51.671
to be good at it.

00:02:51.704 --> 00:02:55.374
And I feel like some comics
take that one bit of criticism

00:02:55.407 --> 00:02:58.144
and they internalize it
as oppression.

00:02:58.177 --> 00:03:01.180
It is not oppression.

00:03:01.213 --> 00:03:04.817
I also... I-I get a lot
of feedback because of my job.

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:08.287
And I expect it, and, I mean,
it happens every day,

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:10.723
and, um, I use it to make myself
a better comic.

00:03:10.756 --> 00:03:13.025
Do you think...?
If people don't know the-the...

00:03:13.058 --> 00:03:15.261
the comic community,
is this a tool

00:03:15.294 --> 00:03:16.963
that is being used
in the community?

00:03:16.996 --> 00:03:19.098
Do you feel like are you pushing
back against a force

00:03:19.131 --> 00:03:21.100
that is moving
within the comedic community?

00:03:21.133 --> 00:03:22.535
Do you mean, like...

00:03:22.568 --> 00:03:23.936
-Do mean rape jokes? Do you mean
are folks... -Like rape jokes.

00:03:23.969 --> 00:03:25.705
-...telling rape jokes?
Is that the question? -Yes.

00:03:25.738 --> 00:03:27.540
That is. Well, yeah.
I didn't want to say the word

00:03:27.573 --> 00:03:28.808
-as many times as you...
-No. Yeah.

00:03:28.841 --> 00:03:30.610
...but I'm still getting
comfortable saying it.

00:03:30.643 --> 00:03:32.578
Rape jokes have been around
for...

00:03:32.611 --> 00:03:34.080
I've been doing standup
for ten years.

00:03:34.113 --> 00:03:36.382
I've been doing comedy
professionally for 15.

00:03:36.415 --> 00:03:38.784
Rape jokes are a perennial...
It's a perennial topic.

00:03:38.817 --> 00:03:40.720
There's even that little
phrase-- "rape jokes"--

00:03:40.753 --> 00:03:42.355
we know what we mean by that

00:03:42.388 --> 00:03:43.723
if you're a part
of the comedy community

00:03:43.756 --> 00:03:45.558
or if you pay attention
to standup at all.

00:03:45.591 --> 00:03:47.627
It usually means, like,
a comic gets on stage,

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:49.195
and they just throw out
the word "rape."

00:03:49.228 --> 00:03:51.764
It doesn't have, um,
a punch line.

00:03:51.797 --> 00:03:53.566
It's to get
an audience reaction,

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:55.801
a cheap laugh
because you've said something

00:03:55.834 --> 00:03:58.671
that most people don't feel
comfortable talking about.

00:03:58.704 --> 00:04:01.507
Just a word that is taboo,
and I...

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:03.442
What I am pushing back on
with this special...

00:04:03.475 --> 00:04:05.177
It's an hour
about sexual assault

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:07.313
from my perspective
as a survivor.

00:04:07.346 --> 00:04:09.248
But it's also really funny.
Like, it's...

00:04:09.281 --> 00:04:12.451
I mean, I am openly going
to tell you, it is funny.

00:04:12.484 --> 00:04:14.153
(laughter)

00:04:14.186 --> 00:04:16.756
And I'm very proud of it
because I think this is a way

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:18.424
we could reframe
the conversation.

00:04:18.457 --> 00:04:19.792
Like, not all comics...

00:04:19.825 --> 00:04:21.193
We're not a monolithic field

00:04:21.226 --> 00:04:22.828
where everybody has
the same views.

00:04:22.861 --> 00:04:25.631
Um, folks have different
perspectives, and this is one

00:04:25.664 --> 00:04:28.200
that I don't think
we have heard before.

00:04:28.233 --> 00:04:30.202
Cameron, my favorite question.

00:04:30.235 --> 00:04:31.604
Yeah.

00:04:31.637 --> 00:04:33.005
Tell me something
I already know.

00:04:33.038 --> 00:04:36.976
Um, well,
you already know that...

00:04:37.009 --> 00:04:39.045
this is a great look, and...

00:04:39.078 --> 00:04:41.047
(laughter)

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:43.683
...if you're a dude,
and this doesn't work for you,

00:04:43.716 --> 00:04:45.584
I'm fine with that.

00:04:45.617 --> 00:04:48.321
Her comedy special Rape Jokes 
is available

00:04:48.354 --> 00:04:50.523
on her Web site,
CameronEsposito.com.

00:04:50.556 --> 00:04:52.458
Cameron Esposito.
The fight continues.
