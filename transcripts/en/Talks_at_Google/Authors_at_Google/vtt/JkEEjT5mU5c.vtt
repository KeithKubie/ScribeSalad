Haskel and Mr. Stian Westlake.

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.940
Jonathan Haskel is a Professor
of Economics at Imperial

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.380
College Business School.

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.930

Advisor to the UK'S Minister

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:25.320
of Innovation and Technology.

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.710
Together, they won the Indigo
Prize in 2017 for their work

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.750
on economic measurement,
much of which

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.750
went into the book they are
here today to discuss titled,

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.291
"Capitalism without
Capital: The Rise

00:00:35.291 --> 00:00:37.355
of the Intangible Economy."

00:00:37.355 --> 00:00:39.480
Please join me in welcoming
to Google, Mr. Jonathan

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.117
Haskel and Stian Westlake.

00:00:41.117 --> 00:00:43.067
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:43.067 --> 00:00:44.900
JONATHAN HASKEL: Thank
you very much indeed,

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:45.775
ladies and gentlemen.

00:00:45.775 --> 00:00:47.830
Thank you all very
much for coming.

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:49.830
We're going to split this
presentation into two.

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:52.864
I'm going to try and talk for
about 15 minutes about some

00:00:52.864 --> 00:00:54.030
of the topics from the book.

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.440
And then I'll pass
over to Stian,

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.530
and delighted to have
some Q&amp;A as well.

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.110
So here, talk about
capitalism without capital--

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:02.800
it's in three parts.

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.740
The first asks
the question, what

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.050
do we know about the rise
of the intangible economy?

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.460
I'll tell you what.

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.380
The intangible economy
isn't just a second.

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.500
Secondly, so why is
the intangible capital

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.119
a different type of capital?

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.660
And thirdly, what does this mean
for business in the economy?

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:19.320
So I'll walk you through
the first two things.

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.403
And then, as I mentioned,
I'll pass over to Stian.

00:01:21.403 --> 00:01:23.670
So let's get started
with the core

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.510
of what this book is about.

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:27.150
And it is about the following.

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.060
The nature of investment in
capital assets is changing.

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.110
So here on the
left hand side are

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:35.580
the types of capital
assets, which

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:37.860
you'd be very familiar with
if you're an accountant,

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.489
or if you working on GDP
and things like that.

00:01:40.489 --> 00:01:42.530
It's just kind of
straightforward for economists.

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.260
Here are the classic types
of investments that are made.

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.620
They're very tangible things,
buildings, computers, plant

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:51.320
and machinery, and vehicles.

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:55.770
And when national income
accounting, accounting GDP,

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.320
was invented in
the 1930s, 1940s,

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.870
these were the types of
assets which people measured

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:03.480
investment for, and
that passed on to GDP.

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:06.630
And company accounts reflect
this kind of thing as well.

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.850
At the core of our
book is the fact

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:12.130
that these assets, investment
in these assets, is going on,

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:15.030
but investment in
these intangible assets

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:16.050
is zooming ahead.

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.270
Let me walk you through
the kind of things which

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.750
these intangible assets
are, things like R&amp;D,

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.080
training, design, things like
organizational development--

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.320
you know, you can buy shoes
from Walmart and from K-Mart,

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.980
but somehow they feel like
very different organizations--

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.770
things like brands and
marketing, artistic originals.

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:38.490
Here's Britain's most famous
innovation over here--

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:40.470
big intangible asset.

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.290
And as I don't need to say, in
this building here, software

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:44.130
and data--

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.600
important intangible
assets as well.

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.560
So these are the types of
assets which you can't touch

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:50.940
and you can't feel.

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.760
They're in contrast to
these tangible assets.

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.350
And as I say, the
core of our book

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:58.470
is about the movement of
these intangible assets.

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.880
Now, this would be, basically,
of no interest whatsoever,

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.670
were it not for the fact
that this change is actually

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.040
rather hard to discern.

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.430
GDP still doesn't include
most intangible assets.

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:14.880
Let's start with the assets
which GDP does include.

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.260
And that includes
these tangible assets.

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.400
So when you hear on the news
about the release of GDP

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.355
figures and all of that,
these are the types

00:03:22.355 --> 00:03:24.480
of investments that those
national accountants will

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.820
be telling you about-- it's
going up, it's going down,

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:27.930
and all of that.

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.305
Some intangibles have
been added over the years.

00:03:30.305 --> 00:03:33.600
So software is counted
as an asset, something

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:35.820
that firms are investing in.

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:39.300
Likewise, artistic originals,
and likewise, in R&amp;D.

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:42.690
But there's still a whole load
of assets which aren't counted

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:44.910
so much in the GDP figures.

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:47.190
As I mentioned before,
design, business processes,

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:48.450
marketing, and so forth.

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:51.820
And I ought to
mention beta as well.

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:54.710
In GDP, the national
income accountants

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:56.850
are supposed to count
the kinds of investments

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:59.560
that firms are making in data
and understanding that data.

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:03.480
But that practice varies a lot
across different countries.

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:07.530
Now, if this thing is rather
hidden in the national income

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:11.170
accounts, it's distinctly
hidden in the company accounts.

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:14.160
So this slide on the
right is taken from a book

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:15.990
by Baruch Lev and Feng Gu.

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:19.190
And the title of that book
is "The End of Accounting."

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:20.579
And that's all you need to know.

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:22.667
And that the core
of their argument--

00:04:22.667 --> 00:04:24.750
it's a wonderful book--
the core of their argument

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:26.430
is that company
accounts are basically

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:29.779
completely uninformative
about modern day companies.

00:04:29.779 --> 00:04:32.070
Let me just walk you through
very quickly what this is.

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:35.220
This blue bar here says,
take the companies who

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:38.340
entered the US stock
market in the 1950s

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:40.950
and ask what fraction
of their market value

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:43.036
can be explained
by the assets that

00:04:43.036 --> 00:04:44.160
are on their balance sheet.

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:45.868
These are traditional
tangible companies.

00:04:45.868 --> 00:04:47.730
And the answer is 85%.

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:50.420
Take the companies
over here, who

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:52.410
entered the US stock
market in the 2000s,

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:53.520
ask the same question.

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:55.090
And the answer is about 25%.

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:57.780
This is an r-squared form of
regression, for those of you

00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:59.650
who remember, [INAUDIBLE].

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:02.540
So in other words, these
company accounts here-- very

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:05.550
uninformative about
the set of assets which

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:07.820
are really powering a company.

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:11.850
And so therefore, underneath
our heading there,

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:14.050
this change is hidden.

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:16.384
Now, of course, if
intangibles are hidden,

00:05:16.384 --> 00:05:18.300
you might ask the question,
well, how on earth

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:19.750
do we know anything about them?

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:22.710
And fortunately, some scholars
have recognized all of this.

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:26.520
Here's a picture of Fritz
Machlup, an Austrian refugee

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:31.020
who came, as many did, to
the US, found sanctuary

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:33.015
in this country in the 1930s.

00:05:33.015 --> 00:05:33.890
And he wrote a book--

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:35.190
I'm sorry, this hasn't
come out very well--

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:36.984
in 1962, called "The
Production and Distribution

00:05:36.984 --> 00:05:38.370
of Knowledge in
the United States."

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:39.240
And it's an early book.

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:41.070
It's a wonderful read,
actually, if you're

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:42.840
interested in the
history of technology.

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:44.820
It's an early book which
walks through really

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:47.730
some early computing, some
very early kind of software,

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:49.300
that people were
doing at that time.

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:51.420
And Machlup asks the
question, suppose

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:53.040
we counted the money
that firms were

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:56.220
spending on those types
of things as an investment

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:57.370
as well?

00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:00.270
Now in the 1990s,
Hal Varian, who's

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:02.270
sitting over here,
and Carl Shapiro,

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:05.400
wrote a book called "Information
Rules" in the early part

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:06.960
of the information
economy, which

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:08.610
made a lot of these
points as well,

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:11.430
and pointed to some of
the economic attributes

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:14.430
of intangibles, which I'll
be talking about in a second.

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:17.860
I mentioned Baruch Lev before,
Professor of Accounting at NYU.

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:20.010
He had an important book
in 2001, which was more

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:21.660
on the accounting side.

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:23.540
And then some
co-authors of ours,

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:26.400
Carol Corrado, Charles
Hulton, and Dan Sichel,

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:28.160
wrote about this in 2005.

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:32.400
So essentially, what our book
does is it takes the kind

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:35.280
of experimental work that
these authors have done--

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:37.740
and the work that we've been
privileged enough to co-author

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:38.700
with them as well--

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:41.440
it takes that experimental
work and asks the question,

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:44.520
suppose we did count all of
this intangible investment,

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:45.930
what would the
economy look like?

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:48.150
And the book essentially
documents all of that.

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:50.730
Now, once you've written
a book on something,

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:53.070
you see them
absolutely everywhere.

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:57.150
So let me give you an example
of what we mean by intangibles

00:06:57.150 --> 00:06:59.070
and just--

00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:01.440
obviously, in the
tech sector, there

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:02.940
are lots of
intangibles, like I say,

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:04.898
software, and data, and
all that kind of thing.

00:07:04.898 --> 00:07:07.230
But it's not just a story
about the tech sector.

00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:10.330
Now, since you are a fit
and healthy California lot,

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:13.170
let's go to the gym, where
you see lots of intangibles,

00:07:13.170 --> 00:07:13.990
according to us.

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:17.220
So in 1977, so this is Arnold
Schwarzenegger's breakthrough

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:19.290
movie "Pumping Iron" in 1977.

00:07:19.290 --> 00:07:21.060
Here's a picture
of a gym in 1997.

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:24.870
Lots of tangible things,
namely buildings and machines.

00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:27.930
And similarly, if you
go to the gym in 2007,

00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:29.950
you see the buildings
and the machines.

00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:32.160
But you see some intangible
things as well, actually.

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:34.730
So when you go into
the door, the software

00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:37.270
registers you in the door and
tells you you haven't been--

00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:40.160
you've only been doing
an hour that week

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:42.570
and not any of the week before.

00:07:42.570 --> 00:07:45.180
People are doing training,
and teaching, all of this.

00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:47.380
And there's branding and
marketing going on as well.

00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:50.862
And in fact, there's a sort
of pure intangible company

00:07:50.862 --> 00:07:53.070
who we talk about in the
book, which is a New Zealand

00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:55.950
company called the Les Mills--

00:07:55.950 --> 00:07:58.240
well, Bodypump is their
particular product,

00:07:58.240 --> 00:07:59.750
which is a high intensity--

00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:01.500
oh, those of you who
would go to the gym--

00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:04.200
high intensity kind of training,
you know, with music going on,

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:06.744
and you lift weights, and
all that kind of stuff.

00:08:06.744 --> 00:08:08.160
And what the Les
Mills do, they're

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:09.620
a small company in
New Zealand, who

00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:13.200
have literally managed
to sell worldwide

00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:14.670
their type of exercise.

00:08:14.670 --> 00:08:16.710
And the exercise is
essentially a collection

00:08:16.710 --> 00:08:17.760
of intangible assets.

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:20.670
They've negotiated with the
music rights owner, owners

00:08:20.670 --> 00:08:21.450
to the music.

00:08:21.450 --> 00:08:24.630
They've designed the
exercise that goes with it.

00:08:24.630 --> 00:08:27.540
They train people
who stand in the gym,

00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:29.900
and help you do the exercises
correctly, and so forth.

00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:32.880
So those-- it's a pure
bundle of intangible assets,

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:34.350
if you sort of see what I mean.

00:08:34.350 --> 00:08:36.299
And that was an
example that we, I say,

00:08:36.299 --> 00:08:38.640
we talk about in the book.

00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:40.679
Now, the rise of
intangible investment,

00:08:40.679 --> 00:08:42.840
we think is a long term trend.

00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:45.444
And again, we go back to
these experimental types

00:08:45.444 --> 00:08:46.860
of results which
ask the question,

00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:49.710
if you augmented GDP with
these intangible assets, what

00:08:49.710 --> 00:08:50.680
would you see?

00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:54.330
And you essentially
see a rise over here

00:08:54.330 --> 00:08:55.770
in intangible assets--

00:08:55.770 --> 00:08:58.680
this is shares of investments
in proportion to GDP--

00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:00.785
and a fall of tangible assets.

00:09:00.785 --> 00:09:02.160
And one of the
things about that,

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:04.440
which Carol Corrado
has looked at,

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:06.290
is she's looked at
that for the US.

00:09:06.290 --> 00:09:08.760
I'm sorry, I have said this is
for the US and EU countries.

00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:11.190
Carol Corrado has looked at
this for the US going back

00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:14.610
to the 1940s, and shows a steady
rise-- that's the blue line--

00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:19.120
in intangible assets
overtaking tangible assets.

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:21.180
So we have a thing
here, where we point out

00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:22.980
that this rise in
intangible assets

00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:24.460
predates the IT revolution.

00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:26.299
I'll come back to
that in just a second.

00:09:26.299 --> 00:09:28.590
But since lots of people are
going around writing books

00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:30.048
with the word
"capital" in them, we

00:09:30.048 --> 00:09:32.290
thought we'd try and push
our book a little bit.

00:09:32.290 --> 00:09:34.040
We think intangible
capital is the capital

00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:35.450
of the 21st century.

00:09:35.450 --> 00:09:37.410
As these types of
graphs illustrate,

00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:39.690
there's more of this type
of thing coming along.

00:09:39.690 --> 00:09:41.820
Let me say a word about
the IT revolution,

00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:44.580
given the building where
we have the honor to stand.

00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:47.070
Which came first, the IT
or the intangible economy?

00:09:47.070 --> 00:09:48.960
Because a lot of
people take the view

00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:52.429
that after the IT revolution
came along, then, of course,

00:09:52.429 --> 00:09:53.970
all this intangible
stuff came along.

00:09:53.970 --> 00:09:55.740
So once computers came
along, then people

00:09:55.740 --> 00:09:58.570
had to invent all sorts of ways
of reinventing the business,

00:09:58.570 --> 00:09:59.927
and so on.

00:09:59.927 --> 00:10:02.010
Let's just try a slightly
different point of view.

00:10:02.010 --> 00:10:04.426
A little bit speculative, but
nonetheless, we'll try this.

00:10:04.426 --> 00:10:05.576
So here's a picture.

00:10:05.576 --> 00:10:06.950
Since we're a long
way from home,

00:10:06.950 --> 00:10:09.580
here's a picture of British
people drinking tea.

00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:11.980
So there's a-- just
to make us feel like--

00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:13.510
we've been on
planes continuously

00:10:13.510 --> 00:10:16.210
for the last few days-- just
to make us anchored to home.

00:10:16.210 --> 00:10:18.520
This is in the Lyons Tea Shop.

00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:20.890
This was-- we've called
it here the McDonald's

00:10:20.890 --> 00:10:22.840
of mid-twentieth
century Britain.

00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:25.750
Hopefully, a little more
healthy than McDonald's.

00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:28.117
But this was a huge
chain of tea shops

00:10:28.117 --> 00:10:29.950
which existed on, more
or less, every street

00:10:29.950 --> 00:10:33.730
corner in many
British places and fed

00:10:33.730 --> 00:10:36.160
the great national British diet.

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:38.950
And what that needed is--
it had a big payroll.

00:10:38.950 --> 00:10:42.430
And it had huge numbers
of payroll clocks, who

00:10:42.430 --> 00:10:44.290
were required to
administer the payroll,

00:10:44.290 --> 00:10:47.344
lots of almost entirely
women waitresses working.

00:10:47.344 --> 00:10:49.510
They needed to be paid,
they were working part-time,

00:10:49.510 --> 00:10:51.884
they weren't working all day,
and all that kind of thing.

00:10:51.884 --> 00:10:55.690
So along came the LEO, the Lyons
Electronic Office, the world's

00:10:55.690 --> 00:10:57.460
first business computer.

00:10:57.460 --> 00:10:59.717
It sort of has, I
guess, a linear--

00:10:59.717 --> 00:11:01.300
for the history of
technology people--

00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:04.860
a kind of lineage from the types
of computers that were invented

00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:06.700
in the Second World
War to try to break

00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:07.660
codes, and all of that.

00:11:07.660 --> 00:11:10.210
And this was a
computer, essentially,

00:11:10.210 --> 00:11:16.270
which was meeting the demand
for the administration

00:11:16.270 --> 00:11:17.170
of this payroll.

00:11:17.170 --> 00:11:19.700
So again, some sense--

00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:22.730
this type of demand here
brought forth the invention

00:11:22.730 --> 00:11:23.730
of IT and the computers.

00:11:23.730 --> 00:11:27.300
And it was talked about
a bit in Beniger's book.

00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:29.710
OK now, let me say a
little bit about why

00:11:29.710 --> 00:11:33.460
intangible capital is different
before passing over to Stian.

00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:37.924
You might say, well, surely
the nature of the economy,

00:11:37.924 --> 00:11:40.090
and investment in the
economy, changes all the time.

00:11:40.090 --> 00:11:42.400
So we used to invest in canals.

00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:44.920
Then we started
investing in railways.

00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:47.110
And then we started
investing in roads.

00:11:47.110 --> 00:11:48.696
Then we started
investing in airports.

00:11:48.696 --> 00:11:50.320
You might say, the
nature of investment

00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:53.980
is changing all the time,
then why should we bother?

00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:58.000
And we argue the intangible
investment is interesting

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.030
because it's got some
different economic properties.

00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:03.460
So now we get to put our
economist hat on for a second.

00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:06.370
It's got some different economic
properties to tangibles.

00:12:06.370 --> 00:12:07.930
And this is where
there's an overlap

00:12:07.930 --> 00:12:10.138
in our book with Hal Varian's
book, which I mentioned

00:12:10.138 --> 00:12:12.770
earlier, about information.

00:12:12.770 --> 00:12:16.840
So the first thing is, which
is mentioned in Hal's book,

00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:18.640
is that intangible
assets can often

00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:21.010
be used over and over
again, in multiple places.

00:12:21.010 --> 00:12:22.310
They can be scaled up.

00:12:22.310 --> 00:12:24.560
There's some examples
of this in a second.

00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:28.750
The second is they're all going
to begin with S, these things,

00:12:28.750 --> 00:12:30.460
just to help you
clear in their mind.

00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:33.200
Intangible assets are
what economists call sunk.

00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:36.310
It's often difficult to get them
back or recover their value.

00:12:36.310 --> 00:12:37.780
Again, an example coming up.

00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:40.710
Thirdly, spillovers--
tangible assets

00:12:40.710 --> 00:12:44.530
spill over in ways that other
people can benefit from them.

00:12:44.530 --> 00:12:46.060
And fourthly, synergies.

00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:48.920
If you bundle these
intangible assets together,

00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:51.020
then you can get a
particularly valuable product.

00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:52.450
Let me walk you
through some of this.

00:12:52.450 --> 00:12:54.710
And then Stian will talk about
some of the consequences.

00:12:54.710 --> 00:12:56.334
So again, just to
make us feel at home,

00:12:56.334 --> 00:12:59.491
let's again start with
London taxi cabs here.

00:12:59.491 --> 00:13:01.990
Taxi cabs, if you've ever been
to London-- as you will know,

00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:03.850
you can squeeze five
people in there.

00:13:03.850 --> 00:13:06.000
If you want to take
a sixth person,

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:07.720
you've got to get
a new taxi cab.

00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:12.280
So the taxi cabs are not
scalable in the way that Uber,

00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:13.780
of course--

00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:15.930
you know, you can use it
to get to London airport,

00:13:15.930 --> 00:13:16.930
to get to San Francisco.

00:13:16.930 --> 00:13:18.280
You can use it in San Francisco.

00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:21.110
You can scale this thing
over and over again.

00:13:21.110 --> 00:13:24.010
So the first interesting
consequence about intangibles

00:13:24.010 --> 00:13:26.260
is that companies who have
these intangible assets

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:29.050
can potentially scale
up very substantially.

00:13:29.050 --> 00:13:32.570
Secondly, I mentioned this
economics term, "sunkenness."

00:13:32.570 --> 00:13:35.917
A word about Nokia, great
European success story,

00:13:35.917 --> 00:13:37.750
back in the day of
course, that at one point

00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:41.060
had 72% of the world's
smartphone market.

00:13:41.060 --> 00:13:42.760
But it all went
wrong, essentially,

00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:46.480
after the invention of the Apple
iPhone, and Apple took over.

00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:48.550
Nokia basically had
at least a couple

00:13:48.550 --> 00:13:50.090
of assets on its balance sheet.

00:13:50.090 --> 00:13:52.720
The first thing is it had
a very nice headquarters,

00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:54.640
very razzmatazz headquarters.

00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:57.142
It was able immediately
to sell that asset.

00:13:57.142 --> 00:13:59.350
Now, if you'll remember what
I was saying earlier on,

00:13:59.350 --> 00:14:00.880
that's a tangible asset.

00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:03.530
It's a building, a
company building.

00:14:03.530 --> 00:14:05.152
So that's well
known to accountants

00:14:05.152 --> 00:14:06.610
and to national
income accountants.

00:14:06.610 --> 00:14:08.920
A tangible asset-- it
was able to dispose of it

00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:10.230
and sell it off.

00:14:10.230 --> 00:14:13.270
But it had a big intangible
asset, namely the Symbian

00:14:13.270 --> 00:14:16.120
Operating System, which after
the merger with Microsoft,

00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:17.630
became Windows Mobile.

00:14:17.630 --> 00:14:19.630
And that-- essentially,
it was impossible to get

00:14:19.630 --> 00:14:20.660
any of that money back.

00:14:20.660 --> 00:14:23.500
So the intangible
asset was much more

00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:24.990
difficult to get
that money back.

00:14:24.990 --> 00:14:27.115
So that's, as I said, what
economists call as sunk.

00:14:27.115 --> 00:14:29.448
That's obviously going to
have some implications for how

00:14:29.448 --> 00:14:31.090
a bank might feel,
if a bank is going

00:14:31.090 --> 00:14:34.420
to lend a company some money,
which Stian will come back to

00:14:34.420 --> 00:14:36.400
in just a second.

00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:38.320
Spillovers, I mentioned
spillovers before.

00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:40.450
So if you've got a tangible
asset, like a factory,

00:14:40.450 --> 00:14:42.130
you just put a guard outside it.

00:14:42.130 --> 00:14:44.704
Nobody else can get
into your factory.

00:14:44.704 --> 00:14:46.870
On the other hand, if you've
got an intangible asset

00:14:46.870 --> 00:14:48.610
like a design--

00:14:48.610 --> 00:14:50.890
well, if you think
back to smartphones

00:14:50.890 --> 00:14:53.540
before Apple came along, they
were all a bit clunky, frankly.

00:14:53.540 --> 00:14:55.180
They were all just
a bit embarrassing.

00:14:55.180 --> 00:14:57.922
And the moment that the
Apple smartphone came along,

00:14:57.922 --> 00:14:59.380
basically all the
other smartphones

00:14:59.380 --> 00:15:00.410
looked like that Apple.

00:15:00.410 --> 00:15:03.220
So this is what economists
call spillovers,

00:15:03.220 --> 00:15:07.324
namely if I have an idea, it
can spill over, potentially,

00:15:07.324 --> 00:15:07.990
to other people.

00:15:07.990 --> 00:15:09.700
So other people can
adopt that idea.

00:15:09.700 --> 00:15:12.310
Whereas if I have a
factory, you guys and gals

00:15:12.310 --> 00:15:13.600
can't come into my factory.

00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:17.320
So again, Hal Varian's book
talks about that kind of issue

00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:17.840
as well.

00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:19.840
So obviously, that's going
to make it difficult,

00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:22.930
potentially, for the people
investing in intangible assets

00:15:22.930 --> 00:15:24.430
to maybe get some
of their returns.

00:15:24.430 --> 00:15:29.890
OK, the last S that we have of
these properties is synergy.

00:15:29.890 --> 00:15:33.040
So here's the EpiPen, as I was
saying, $1.2 billion profits

00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:35.170
for Mylan in 2015.

00:15:35.170 --> 00:15:40.287
And you might think that the
core of the EpiPen, which

00:15:40.287 --> 00:15:42.370
hasn't signed it, as it
were, the chemical formula

00:15:42.370 --> 00:15:44.020
to stop anaphylactic shock.

00:15:44.020 --> 00:15:46.690
The core of it is
an intangible asset,

00:15:46.690 --> 00:15:49.607
namely an idea, namely the
chemical compound that's in it.

00:15:49.607 --> 00:15:51.190
And you might think,
well, that's just

00:15:51.190 --> 00:15:53.929
protected by a patent.

00:15:53.929 --> 00:15:54.970
There is indeed a patent.

00:15:54.970 --> 00:15:57.820
But the patent ran out
almost 100 years ago.

00:15:57.820 --> 00:16:00.460
So the core of it,
or the value of it,

00:16:00.460 --> 00:16:02.220
can't necessarily
be in the patent

00:16:02.220 --> 00:16:04.640
because that's not
defended anymore.

00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:05.740
So what is it?

00:16:05.740 --> 00:16:08.680
According to us, it's a bundle
of these intangible assets.

00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:10.180
Let's go through
some of the others.

00:16:10.180 --> 00:16:11.429
First of all, it's the design.

00:16:11.429 --> 00:16:14.090
So it's designed in a
particularly convenient way.

00:16:14.090 --> 00:16:17.160
Secondly, there's lots of
branding going on as well.

00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:19.160
Often when people talk
about this type of thing,

00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:20.701
they talk about the
EpiPen in the way

00:16:20.701 --> 00:16:22.870
that people used to
talk about Hoovers,

00:16:22.870 --> 00:16:25.084
when they were talking
about vacuum cleaners.

00:16:25.084 --> 00:16:27.250
Thirdly, there's a lot of
marketing and distribution

00:16:27.250 --> 00:16:30.070
around all of this, and
complicated marketing arms,

00:16:30.070 --> 00:16:33.730
and so forth, which the
company worked very hard at.

00:16:33.730 --> 00:16:36.450
And fourthly, there's lots
of training going on as well.

00:16:36.450 --> 00:16:37.900
People get trained to use this.

00:16:37.900 --> 00:16:41.421
And often, the training uses
the very word EpiPen itself.

00:16:41.421 --> 00:16:43.420
In other words, it uses
the branded word itself.

00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:46.450
So again, the synergies
are that we think that when

00:16:46.450 --> 00:16:48.880
you put these intangible
assets together--

00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:50.620
so the intangible
assets of the R&amp;D

00:16:50.620 --> 00:16:54.330
knowledge, the design, the
training, the marketing,

00:16:54.330 --> 00:16:55.160
the branding.

00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:57.070
If you put these
intangible assets together,

00:16:57.070 --> 00:16:59.710
then you can get a
particularly valuable product.

00:16:59.710 --> 00:17:01.572
OK, why don't I
pass over to Stian

00:17:01.572 --> 00:17:03.780
to say some more about what
this means to the economy

00:17:03.780 --> 00:17:04.280
and society.

00:17:06.089 --> 00:17:07.589
STIAN WESTLAKE:
Thank you, Jonathan.

00:17:07.589 --> 00:17:08.940
And thank you all for coming.

00:17:08.940 --> 00:17:11.579
Jonathan's talked about
the rigorous empirical

00:17:11.579 --> 00:17:12.480
and conceptual stuff.

00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:15.700
This is more the speculative
so-what stuff now.

00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:17.435
But I'm going to talk
about a few things.

00:17:17.435 --> 00:17:18.810
I'm going to talk
about what this

00:17:18.810 --> 00:17:21.150
means for leader companies
and laggard companies,

00:17:21.150 --> 00:17:22.650
in this phenomenon
that economists

00:17:22.650 --> 00:17:23.724
call secular stagnation.

00:17:23.724 --> 00:17:25.349
I'm going to talk a
bit about what this

00:17:25.349 --> 00:17:27.420
means for financing businesses.

00:17:27.420 --> 00:17:30.540
I'm going to talk about the
human side of this, who wins

00:17:30.540 --> 00:17:32.442
and who loses in an
intangible economy.

00:17:32.442 --> 00:17:34.650
And then, because it's kind
of related to my day job,

00:17:34.650 --> 00:17:36.660
I'm going to talk about
maybe how governments

00:17:36.660 --> 00:17:39.130
should respond to this.

00:17:39.130 --> 00:17:41.670
But let's start by talking
about winners and losers

00:17:41.670 --> 00:17:42.660
in the business world.

00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:46.242
And standing here, in a kind
of illustrious intangible

00:17:46.242 --> 00:17:48.700
intensive business, I probably
don't need to tell you this.

00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:50.730
But there's been some
great data-driven research

00:17:50.730 --> 00:17:52.104
in the last few
years, by the OEC

00:17:52.104 --> 00:17:54.570
and other people, that
show that in sector

00:17:54.570 --> 00:17:56.520
after sector, in
country after country,

00:17:56.520 --> 00:17:59.400
the gap between the most
successful businesses

00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:01.710
and the rest, in terms of
profitability, productivity,

00:18:01.710 --> 00:18:03.660
and other measures,
has been growing.

00:18:03.660 --> 00:18:05.054
So this is manufacturing firms.

00:18:05.054 --> 00:18:05.970
This is service firms.

00:18:05.970 --> 00:18:06.780
But it kind of works.

00:18:06.780 --> 00:18:07.380
It's fractal.

00:18:07.380 --> 00:18:10.080
It works, if you look by
sector and by country as well.

00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:12.720
And the productivity and
the profitability of firms

00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:14.250
seems to be splitting.

00:18:14.250 --> 00:18:16.185
And economists and
policy makers have really

00:18:16.185 --> 00:18:17.810
started scratching
their heads at this.

00:18:17.810 --> 00:18:20.190
They'll say, what can be
the possible explanation?

00:18:20.190 --> 00:18:22.780
What are the potential reasons?

00:18:22.780 --> 00:18:24.740
The OEC have said,
well, maybe this is--

00:18:24.740 --> 00:18:26.880
technology is not
diffusing enough.

00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:29.130
So Google's smaller
competitors are not

00:18:29.130 --> 00:18:31.620
learning enough about Google's
algorithms quickly enough.

00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:32.980
Well, that might be going wrong.

00:18:32.980 --> 00:18:35.006
Or maybe the governmental
organizations

00:18:35.006 --> 00:18:36.630
that are meant to
encourage competition

00:18:36.630 --> 00:18:38.660
in the markets have
somehow dropped the ball,

00:18:38.660 --> 00:18:40.920
or they're off the pace.

00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:42.780
Those have been some
possible explanations.

00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:45.780
We think that the rise
of intangible investment

00:18:45.780 --> 00:18:48.721
helps explain this puzzle,
for a number of reasons.

00:18:48.721 --> 00:18:50.970
And I'm going to go back to
the four S's that Jonathan

00:18:50.970 --> 00:18:52.300
talked about earlier.

00:18:52.300 --> 00:18:55.685
So the first-- this kind of
idea of scalability that Hal

00:18:55.685 --> 00:18:57.150
and others have written about--

00:18:57.150 --> 00:18:59.460
we think is hugely important
from this point of view.

00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:02.640
If you think of an intangible
intensive business,

00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:06.150
like Uber in the
hustle transport sector

00:19:06.150 --> 00:19:11.040
or Starbucks in the cafe
and beverage sector,

00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:13.650
Uber's got a bunch of
valuable intangibles

00:19:13.650 --> 00:19:15.250
related to its
network of drivers,

00:19:15.250 --> 00:19:18.360
its data, its software.

00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:21.120
Starbucks has got very
valuable intangibles

00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:23.640
in the form of its brand,
its operating processes,

00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:25.170
and its supply chains.

00:19:25.170 --> 00:19:27.337
Those assets are
much more valuable

00:19:27.337 --> 00:19:28.920
at scale, where if
you can deploy them

00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:30.570
across a big business,
than they would

00:19:30.570 --> 00:19:33.360
be for a little small
local taxi firm near me,

00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:36.570
or an excellent but
small local cafe near me.

00:19:36.570 --> 00:19:40.440
So if you're in that position
of those small, relatively less

00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:42.690
profitable firms, your
incentive to invest

00:19:42.690 --> 00:19:45.580
in the next intangible
is that much less.

00:19:45.580 --> 00:19:47.631
Spillovers matter as well.

00:19:47.631 --> 00:19:49.380
Some of you may be
familiar with this book

00:19:49.380 --> 00:19:51.910
a while ago from Hank
Chesbrough, a great management

00:19:51.910 --> 00:19:53.140
studies guy.

00:19:53.140 --> 00:19:54.940
He talked about open
innovation, the idea

00:19:54.940 --> 00:19:57.190
that businesses can
do a lot of innovation

00:19:57.190 --> 00:19:58.720
by learning from
other companies.

00:19:58.720 --> 00:19:59.980
And you know, you can
spend a lot of money

00:19:59.980 --> 00:20:01.730
on consultants telling
you how to do that.

00:20:01.730 --> 00:20:03.700
Sometimes they're
very good at it.

00:20:03.700 --> 00:20:05.500
Open innovation
is kind of a skill

00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:07.750
of capturing the spillovers
of other people's

00:20:07.750 --> 00:20:09.200
intangible investments.

00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:10.630
And if we imagine
that capability

00:20:10.630 --> 00:20:12.490
to be unevenly
distributed, which

00:20:12.490 --> 00:20:15.060
is the reason why business
school professors will observe

00:20:15.060 --> 00:20:16.690
it in different
companies, then you'd

00:20:16.690 --> 00:20:19.690
imagine that would be another
way that some companies could

00:20:19.690 --> 00:20:21.580
pull ahead of
others in an economy

00:20:21.580 --> 00:20:24.460
where there are lots of
these spillovers to be had.

00:20:24.460 --> 00:20:26.050
And then finally,
synergies, the idea

00:20:26.050 --> 00:20:28.008
that these intangibles
are especially good when

00:20:28.008 --> 00:20:29.620
you combine them
with other ideas,

00:20:29.620 --> 00:20:32.740
as Brian Arthur, the Santa
Fe Institute of Technology

00:20:32.740 --> 00:20:35.680
theorist, likes to point out.

00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:37.081
This was something that was--

00:20:37.081 --> 00:20:38.830
I think I saw it on
"Buzzfeed" originally.

00:20:38.830 --> 00:20:43.180
But this was someone looking
at the App Store, the Apple App

00:20:43.180 --> 00:20:43.972
Store, a while ago.

00:20:43.972 --> 00:20:45.971
And they were looking at
Facebook's relationship

00:20:45.971 --> 00:20:48.250
with them and pointed out
that Facebook had either

00:20:48.250 --> 00:20:50.340
made a lot of the most
downloadable apps,

00:20:50.340 --> 00:20:51.820
or they had acquired
them, or they

00:20:51.820 --> 00:20:53.778
were in a position where
they could clone them,

00:20:53.778 --> 00:20:56.680
because the synergies between
the intangibles that Facebook

00:20:56.680 --> 00:20:58.960
had, in terms of software
data and their relationship

00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:02.560
with their user base, were so
synergistic with other things

00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:04.000
that people were developing.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.670
So all of these things
potentially mean that even

00:21:06.670 --> 00:21:09.940
if competition regulators are
working just as hard as they

00:21:09.940 --> 00:21:12.865
ever were, and even if
technology diffusion--

00:21:12.865 --> 00:21:15.970
no one has slacked off, everyone
pays attention to technology,

00:21:15.970 --> 00:21:17.710
it's everywhere--

00:21:17.710 --> 00:21:22.600
you could still see this gap
between leaders and laggards

00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:23.350
widening.

00:21:23.350 --> 00:21:25.120
And we think this is
also helpful in terms

00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:26.906
of understanding secular
stagnation, which

00:21:26.906 --> 00:21:28.730
is a concept some of you
will be really familiar with.

00:21:28.730 --> 00:21:30.370
For non-economists,
it's this kind

00:21:30.370 --> 00:21:34.390
of paradoxical mixture of low
investment in the economy.

00:21:34.390 --> 00:21:37.360
Companies are, on the
whole, not investing a lot,

00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:38.890
even though interest
rates are low.

00:21:38.890 --> 00:21:39.910
So money is cheap.

00:21:39.910 --> 00:21:42.430
When money is cheap, normally
companies will invest more.

00:21:42.430 --> 00:21:44.277
And there is high
observed return

00:21:44.277 --> 00:21:46.360
of investment on the
companies that are investing,

00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:47.729
and high corporate profits.

00:21:47.729 --> 00:21:49.020
Those things shouldn't coexist.

00:21:49.020 --> 00:21:51.010
If corporate profits are
high and money is cheap,

00:21:51.010 --> 00:21:52.426
economists would
say, well, surely

00:21:52.426 --> 00:21:53.890
everyone wants to pile in.

00:21:53.890 --> 00:21:56.780
But that's not happening
for various reasons.

00:21:56.780 --> 00:21:59.260
And we think this kind of
helps explain it slightly,

00:21:59.260 --> 00:22:03.310
because our leader firms
have a strong incentive

00:22:03.310 --> 00:22:07.344
to invest in
intangibles because they

00:22:07.344 --> 00:22:09.010
can get the benefits
of those synergies.

00:22:09.010 --> 00:22:11.480
They potentially get spillovers
from other investments.

00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:14.080
So they will exhibit high
investment and high ROI,

00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:15.434
which is certainly what we see.

00:22:15.434 --> 00:22:17.350
But at the same time,
you'd have a large crowd

00:22:17.350 --> 00:22:19.930
of laggard firms, who
have less incentive

00:22:19.930 --> 00:22:21.910
to invest in intangibles
because they can't

00:22:21.910 --> 00:22:23.950
benefit from these synergies.

00:22:23.950 --> 00:22:25.360
And if they do, who knows?

00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:28.980
They'll just be copied, or
others will get the benefits.

00:22:28.980 --> 00:22:31.550
And so they would have
low investment, low ROI.

00:22:31.550 --> 00:22:33.240
And we think that
the aggregate there

00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:35.695
could be a high measured
return investment,

00:22:35.695 --> 00:22:37.570
because the people who
are making investments

00:22:37.570 --> 00:22:39.850
are reaping high profits,
and the stock price

00:22:39.850 --> 00:22:42.634
of those companies is
driving up indices.

00:22:42.634 --> 00:22:44.800
But at the same time, the
aggregate level investment

00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:46.224
in a productivity would be low.

00:22:46.224 --> 00:22:47.890
So we think that might
partly contribute

00:22:47.890 --> 00:22:51.940
to this weird paradox that's
going on in the economy today.

00:22:54.622 --> 00:22:55.830
Sorry for the blurry picture.

00:22:55.830 --> 00:22:57.480
Here's some Occupy
Wall Street guys.

00:22:57.480 --> 00:22:59.970
And obviously, one of
the very salient beliefs

00:22:59.970 --> 00:23:02.480
in the world at the moment is
that the financial services

00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:04.230
sector is doing a very
poor job of meeting

00:23:04.230 --> 00:23:05.547
the needs of the real economy.

00:23:05.547 --> 00:23:07.380
It's something that we
feel a lot in London,

00:23:07.380 --> 00:23:09.296
where we have a big
financial services sector.

00:23:09.296 --> 00:23:10.680
And it's felt around the world.

00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:13.020
We, again, think that
there is an issue here

00:23:13.020 --> 00:23:15.660
with an intangible economy,
that in an intangible economy,

00:23:15.660 --> 00:23:17.880
the financial subsystem
that we have at the moment

00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:21.240
is relatively less
well-geared to backing that.

00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:24.390
One of the reasons is one of
the other of our four S's,

00:23:24.390 --> 00:23:25.830
this idea of sunkenness.

00:23:25.830 --> 00:23:28.380
The fact that if your
company goes bust,

00:23:28.380 --> 00:23:30.660
its intangible assets are
pretty hard to sell on.

00:23:30.660 --> 00:23:32.130
They're pretty hard to salvage.

00:23:32.130 --> 00:23:37.710
And obviously, if you are a debt
financier-- if you're a bank,

00:23:37.710 --> 00:23:38.940
if you're a bond holder--

00:23:38.940 --> 00:23:40.650
that's a disaster for you.

00:23:40.650 --> 00:23:43.830
You want companies that have
lots of really fungible assets

00:23:43.830 --> 00:23:47.310
that you can take a charge
over if the company fails.

00:23:47.310 --> 00:23:50.170
And obviously, we have a
financial system that is,

00:23:50.170 --> 00:23:51.420
to a great extent--

00:23:51.420 --> 00:23:54.850
Silicon Valley excepted--
dominated by debt provision,

00:23:54.850 --> 00:23:57.240
whether that's bank
finance of small businesses

00:23:57.240 --> 00:24:01.440
or bond finance for
larger businesses.

00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:03.954
There are some ways of
potentially tackling that.

00:24:03.954 --> 00:24:06.120
There are some really
interesting financial services

00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:08.960
companies trying to expand the
scope of intellectual property

00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:09.920
backed lending.

00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:12.612
There's a great interesting
company called MCAM in the UK

00:24:12.612 --> 00:24:13.320
and in Singapore.

00:24:13.320 --> 00:24:16.770
The governments are trying to
work out ways of using patents

00:24:16.770 --> 00:24:18.890
and so forth as security.

00:24:18.890 --> 00:24:21.300
So there are markets
emerging there.

00:24:21.300 --> 00:24:23.580
But I think our normative
position is this probably

00:24:23.580 --> 00:24:25.440
suggests that we want
to see more equity

00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:27.060
finance in the economy.

00:24:27.060 --> 00:24:30.210
And that would require
very big changes.

00:24:30.210 --> 00:24:32.460
Obviously, most
countries strongly

00:24:32.460 --> 00:24:34.230
favor debt finance
in their tax system,

00:24:34.230 --> 00:24:36.210
because you can
claim debt interest

00:24:36.210 --> 00:24:37.990
as a tax deduction,
which you can't

00:24:37.990 --> 00:24:39.839
claim the similar
deduction on equity.

00:24:39.839 --> 00:24:41.880
But it would also require
significant institution

00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:42.379
building.

00:24:42.379 --> 00:24:44.790
Because with the exception of
the kind of very remarkable

00:24:44.790 --> 00:24:47.580
venture capital system in
Silicon Valley, Israel,

00:24:47.580 --> 00:24:49.590
and almost nowhere
else, we don't

00:24:49.590 --> 00:24:52.341
have institutions that really
provide capital, certainly,

00:24:52.341 --> 00:24:54.090
for private companies
or small businesses,

00:24:54.090 --> 00:24:55.930
other than in the form of debt.

00:24:55.930 --> 00:24:58.410
So big project there.

00:24:58.410 --> 00:25:00.300
The second problem from
the financial system

00:25:00.300 --> 00:25:02.130
relates to these
spillovers, this idea

00:25:02.130 --> 00:25:04.200
that Company A can
make an investment,

00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:06.780
but Company B gets
most of the benefit.

00:25:06.780 --> 00:25:10.010
And some of you may be familiar
with the history of the CT

00:25:10.010 --> 00:25:11.940
scanner, a remarkable
medical invention that

00:25:11.940 --> 00:25:15.240
transformed cancer therapy,
neurology, and so forth.

00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:16.920
The origins of the CT scanner--

00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:19.160
this is me and Jonathon's
patriotism again--

00:25:19.160 --> 00:25:21.755
was it was invented by
a British company, EMI,

00:25:21.755 --> 00:25:25.150
who you may be familiar
with as a record label.

00:25:25.150 --> 00:25:28.039
But EMI stands for Electrical
and Mechanical Industries.

00:25:28.039 --> 00:25:29.580
And back in the day,
they were a kind

00:25:29.580 --> 00:25:31.490
of classic 1960s conglomerate.

00:25:31.490 --> 00:25:33.891
They made everything from
Beatles LPs to kettles.

00:25:33.891 --> 00:25:36.390
And one of the things that they
spent all the cash that they

00:25:36.390 --> 00:25:39.180
made from the Beatles
on was the development

00:25:39.180 --> 00:25:42.390
of the CT scanner, which was
a project of an engineer they

00:25:42.390 --> 00:25:44.250
had called Godfrey Hounsfield.

00:25:44.250 --> 00:25:45.900
He pushed this through.

00:25:45.900 --> 00:25:47.430
He invented it.

00:25:47.430 --> 00:25:51.420
EMI shareholders sadly made
absolutely zilch out of the CT

00:25:51.420 --> 00:25:53.250
scanner because that
market was immediately

00:25:53.250 --> 00:25:56.740
dominated by General Electric,
and by Siemens in Germany.

00:25:56.740 --> 00:25:59.130
So the shareholders
made nothing.

00:25:59.130 --> 00:26:02.040
Now, this is, to some
extent, a problem

00:26:02.040 --> 00:26:05.460
for publicly traded companies,
for public equity finance,

00:26:05.460 --> 00:26:07.070
in an intangible economy.

00:26:07.070 --> 00:26:10.530
And there is some really
interesting empirical research

00:26:10.530 --> 00:26:14.400
in the finance field that
seems to suggest that at least

00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:17.850
some publicly traded firms
underinvest in intangibles.

00:26:17.850 --> 00:26:19.426
There's a great economist--

00:26:19.426 --> 00:26:20.800
Walton in London
Business School,

00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:23.970
called Alex Edmonds,
who looked at both R&amp;D

00:26:23.970 --> 00:26:25.410
and organizational capital.

00:26:25.410 --> 00:26:27.659
He worked out the companies
that were very highly

00:26:27.659 --> 00:26:29.950
rated for their organizational
capital, that won awards

00:26:29.950 --> 00:26:32.760
for it, that you could trade
off the back of that otherwise

00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:35.580
totally public information they
systematically outperformed,

00:26:35.580 --> 00:26:38.160
which just the equity
markets don't adequately

00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:40.540
value some of those things.

00:26:40.540 --> 00:26:42.519
And again, it's the intangibles.

00:26:42.519 --> 00:26:44.310
And again, there's a
bit of a paradox here.

00:26:44.310 --> 00:26:46.740
Because if you imagine
that there are spillovers.

00:26:46.740 --> 00:26:49.410
And you're thinking, what
should my portfolio be?

00:26:49.410 --> 00:26:51.540
That would, on the one
hand, increase the benefits

00:26:51.540 --> 00:26:52.579
of diversification.

00:26:52.579 --> 00:26:55.120
If you're a shareholder in EMI,
but you're also a shareholder

00:26:55.120 --> 00:26:58.170
in Siemens and G, you don't
care that EMI don't make money,

00:26:58.170 --> 00:27:00.820
because if you're sufficiently
diversified in that sector,

00:27:00.820 --> 00:27:02.880
the spillovers-- you
can internalize them,

00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:04.914
even if the company
management can't.

00:27:04.914 --> 00:27:06.330
So on the one hand,
you think this

00:27:06.330 --> 00:27:09.240
is going to mean more
index funds, more

00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:11.880
advantage to diversification.

00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:14.490
But the flip side
is that it turns out

00:27:14.490 --> 00:27:17.460
that this effect, the
effect that shareholders

00:27:17.460 --> 00:27:20.400
are wary of,
intangibles, is mitigated

00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:22.200
by concentrated ownership.

00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:27.420
Because investors who can
do ambitious due diligence

00:27:27.420 --> 00:27:29.940
on these complicated
intangible back project.

00:27:29.940 --> 00:27:31.410
Again, there's
evidence that they

00:27:31.410 --> 00:27:34.280
are more willing to put up
with good projects on the--

00:27:34.280 --> 00:27:37.200
with ambitious intangible
based projects on management.

00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:41.970
So that would suggest that you
would see more longshore hedge

00:27:41.970 --> 00:27:44.640
funds doing lots of analysis.

00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:46.710
You'd expect to see the
returns to kind of detail

00:27:46.710 --> 00:27:49.050
the equity analysis
rate going up.

00:27:49.050 --> 00:27:51.090
And you'd expect to see
more active management.

00:27:51.090 --> 00:27:52.800
So it's kind of a bit
of a paradox here.

00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:56.430
And indeed, it does evoke
the way financial services is

00:27:56.430 --> 00:27:59.100
going, where you are having
a bifurcation between more

00:27:59.100 --> 00:28:02.940
of what activist and
analytic heavy hedge funds,

00:28:02.940 --> 00:28:06.450
but at the same time, the big
pool of very diversified kind

00:28:06.450 --> 00:28:09.690
of mechanical traders.

00:28:09.690 --> 00:28:11.070
Better reporting may help this.

00:28:11.070 --> 00:28:12.660
The book that Jonathan talked
about, "The End of Accounting,"

00:28:12.660 --> 00:28:13.800
by Lev and Gu, is
really interesting

00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:15.900
because it says that
we can fix some of this

00:28:15.900 --> 00:28:18.900
by providing better
information to investors.

00:28:18.900 --> 00:28:20.160
But it's not a panacea.

00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:21.999
And again, the
venture capital sector

00:28:21.999 --> 00:28:23.040
is one way of doing this.

00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:24.840
So you take the capital
private to get rid

00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:26.650
of some of these issues.

00:28:26.650 --> 00:28:29.250
But although one of
the struggles that

00:28:29.250 --> 00:28:32.112
places like the UK, and
other developed economies

00:28:32.112 --> 00:28:33.570
outside the US,
have struggled with

00:28:33.570 --> 00:28:35.670
is, how do you grow your
venture capital sector?

00:28:35.670 --> 00:28:37.836
You're in the fortunate
position here of having one.

00:28:37.836 --> 00:28:40.980
But they are quite hard
to grow from scratch.

00:28:40.980 --> 00:28:43.410
The second thing worth
talking about-- this

00:28:43.410 --> 00:28:45.444
comes to few benefits
from the economy.

00:28:45.444 --> 00:28:47.610
And I just want to go back
into history a little bit

00:28:47.610 --> 00:28:51.960
to talk about these intangible
assets tend to be contested.

00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:54.150
This is in a museum in Istanbul.

00:28:54.150 --> 00:28:56.520
This is the oldest human
law code, the law code

00:28:56.520 --> 00:28:59.850
of Ur Nammu, a king in Samaria.

00:28:59.850 --> 00:29:02.220
And this oldest human
law code details,

00:29:02.220 --> 00:29:06.330
in very recognizable detail, how
you can own tangible assets--

00:29:06.330 --> 00:29:07.770
fields, houses,
animals-- the kind

00:29:07.770 --> 00:29:11.487
of things people
owned 2,000 years BC.

00:29:11.487 --> 00:29:14.070
Humans have much less experience
in dealing with the ownership

00:29:14.070 --> 00:29:15.570
of intangible assets.

00:29:15.570 --> 00:29:18.810
Depending on how you cut it, the
earliest laws relating to this

00:29:18.810 --> 00:29:21.450
are either from 1500s or 1700s.

00:29:21.450 --> 00:29:24.570
So human beings have had
over 3,500 years more

00:29:24.570 --> 00:29:28.320
to get our heads around what
it means to own physical stuff,

00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:30.300
than to own intangible
stuff, and what rights

00:29:30.300 --> 00:29:31.197
we have over it.

00:29:31.197 --> 00:29:33.030
And you know, I'm a
historian by background.

00:29:33.030 --> 00:29:35.280
So I kind of think that
the human race needs time

00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:36.180
to digest things.

00:29:36.180 --> 00:29:39.820
We are slow thinkers on
these important questions.

00:29:39.820 --> 00:29:41.640
And one thing that
we know is that when

00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:45.384
the ownership of assets
is unclear, or contested,

00:29:45.384 --> 00:29:46.800
all other things
being equal, that

00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:48.930
tends to reduce investment.

00:29:48.930 --> 00:29:52.110
And at the risk of indulging
in a little bit more history,

00:29:52.110 --> 00:29:54.540
this is the story of
barbed wire and what it

00:29:54.540 --> 00:29:56.070
did to agriculture in the West.

00:29:56.070 --> 00:29:58.740
So this is kind of an analogy
from tangible capital.

00:29:58.740 --> 00:30:00.510
There's a great
economic history paper

00:30:00.510 --> 00:30:04.800
by Hornback of a decade ago
that looked at investment

00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:09.060
in improving fields, improving
croplands, in the Wild West

00:30:09.060 --> 00:30:10.410
in the 19th century.

00:30:10.410 --> 00:30:12.900
And it turned out that
investment in agricultural land

00:30:12.900 --> 00:30:14.490
was quite low in that period.

00:30:14.490 --> 00:30:15.865
Because what would
tend to happen

00:30:15.865 --> 00:30:18.030
is if you would dig and
drain ditches, and do

00:30:18.030 --> 00:30:20.030
all these kind of great
things, with your field,

00:30:20.030 --> 00:30:23.010
and then some cattle baron's
herds would trample it,

00:30:23.010 --> 00:30:24.630
and they would all
be alfalfa, and you

00:30:24.630 --> 00:30:26.380
would have wasted your time.

00:30:26.380 --> 00:30:28.380
But then there was
an exogenous shock.

00:30:28.380 --> 00:30:31.260
In the late 19th
century, some guys

00:30:31.260 --> 00:30:34.260
invented a very cheap way
of keeping cows and crops

00:30:34.260 --> 00:30:36.876
separate from one another,
which was barbed wire.

00:30:36.876 --> 00:30:38.250
It was much cheaper
than fencing.

00:30:38.250 --> 00:30:40.620
There wasn't a lot of trees
or fence in the Wild West.

00:30:40.620 --> 00:30:42.060
So they went to this technology.

00:30:42.060 --> 00:30:43.650
And what these
historians showed is

00:30:43.650 --> 00:30:46.110
that there was suddenly
a spike in investment

00:30:46.110 --> 00:30:47.634
in agricultural land.

00:30:47.634 --> 00:30:49.050
People started
digging the ditches

00:30:49.050 --> 00:30:50.280
they weren't digging before.

00:30:50.280 --> 00:30:51.780
And it kind of shows
that if you can

00:30:51.780 --> 00:30:54.180
fix these problems
of contestedness,

00:30:54.180 --> 00:30:57.000
if you can show who owns
something, who has rights

00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:59.190
to something, then, all
other things being equal,

00:30:59.190 --> 00:31:00.455
you'd expect more investment.

00:31:00.455 --> 00:31:01.590
It's more worthwhile.

00:31:01.590 --> 00:31:04.764
And therefore,
more of it happens.

00:31:04.764 --> 00:31:06.180
This gets us to a
question which I

00:31:06.180 --> 00:31:09.512
know is very dear to the
hearts of at least maybe

00:31:09.512 --> 00:31:11.970
some people here, or some of
your colleagues-- intellectual

00:31:11.970 --> 00:31:14.576
property rules, so who
should own intangible assets.

00:31:14.576 --> 00:31:16.950
And I think here, there's a
kind of interesting trade-off

00:31:16.950 --> 00:31:19.560
between the spillovers
that Jonathan talked about

00:31:19.560 --> 00:31:20.797
and the synergies.

00:31:20.797 --> 00:31:22.755
On the one hand, if we
think about spillovers--

00:31:22.755 --> 00:31:26.580
this is a very standard debate
that many platforms have with

00:31:26.580 --> 00:31:29.920
rights holders and
creative industries--

00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:31.880
how do you best
manage the spillovers?

00:31:31.880 --> 00:31:33.270
This is Blind
Willie Johnson, one

00:31:33.270 --> 00:31:34.980
of the most celebrated
blues artists,

00:31:34.980 --> 00:31:38.790
whose one of his tracks was on
the Voyager Golden Disc, sort

00:31:38.790 --> 00:31:41.970
of representative
of human culture.

00:31:41.970 --> 00:31:43.900
He made no money from his music.

00:31:43.900 --> 00:31:48.300
He died stony-broke
and a tragic example

00:31:48.300 --> 00:31:53.080
of failing to internalize the
spillovers with intangibles.

00:31:53.080 --> 00:31:55.469
The flip side,
obviously, this is

00:31:55.469 --> 00:31:57.510
what sometimes gets called
the Mickey Mouse trap.

00:31:57.510 --> 00:31:59.100
This is the extension
of copyright

00:31:59.100 --> 00:32:02.940
that coincidentally seems to
keep Mickey Mouse continually

00:32:02.940 --> 00:32:04.217
within copyright for Disney.

00:32:04.217 --> 00:32:05.550
So you kind of have a challenge.

00:32:05.550 --> 00:32:07.860
On the one hand, we
don't want a world

00:32:07.860 --> 00:32:09.930
where no creators
get the benefit

00:32:09.930 --> 00:32:12.400
of their intangible investment.

00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:14.340
On the other hand, it's
equally problematic

00:32:14.340 --> 00:32:16.050
to have a world where
rights holders have

00:32:16.050 --> 00:32:17.940
a massive incentive
to continue to lobby

00:32:17.940 --> 00:32:20.160
to extend their rights
over things they created

00:32:20.160 --> 00:32:21.720
a long time in the past--

00:32:21.720 --> 00:32:24.056
and something I think a
lot about on my day job

00:32:24.056 --> 00:32:26.430
and something I know Google
spent a lot of thinking about

00:32:26.430 --> 00:32:27.270
as well.

00:32:27.270 --> 00:32:28.711
So that's one issue about IP.

00:32:28.711 --> 00:32:30.210
But of course,
there's another issue

00:32:30.210 --> 00:32:32.880
about IP, which is if you
have very tight rules,

00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:34.980
how do you get these
synergies, these kind

00:32:34.980 --> 00:32:37.650
of unpredictable benefits,
when people bring together

00:32:37.650 --> 00:32:38.970
different rights?

00:32:38.970 --> 00:32:41.410
And where is the next,
for example, Spotify,

00:32:41.410 --> 00:32:44.700
who were fought tooth and nail
by some parts of the music

00:32:44.700 --> 00:32:49.300
industry, but actually now,
they work well in partnership.

00:32:49.300 --> 00:32:51.630
The one thing that
you might look at here

00:32:51.630 --> 00:32:55.340
is if we can improve the clarity
of IP rules, which means having

00:32:55.340 --> 00:32:56.750
well-funded patent offices.

00:32:56.750 --> 00:32:59.780
It means paying bureaucrats
for it, frankly, but coming up

00:32:59.780 --> 00:33:02.322
with effective rules
that resolve some

00:33:02.322 --> 00:33:03.530
of these inclarity questions.

00:33:03.530 --> 00:33:04.988
That seems to be
a good way forward

00:33:04.988 --> 00:33:07.560
for encouraging investment.

00:33:07.560 --> 00:33:09.050
It also means if
we think about who

00:33:09.050 --> 00:33:12.020
gains from a human level
in this economy, people who

00:33:12.020 --> 00:33:14.960
can make sense of this
contestedness of assets,

00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:16.460
who can bring
together the synergies

00:33:16.460 --> 00:33:18.990
and fix the spillovers,
seem to do well.

00:33:18.990 --> 00:33:20.740
One category of people
who seem to do that

00:33:20.740 --> 00:33:22.370
are heroic entrepreneurs,
people often

00:33:22.370 --> 00:33:23.810
to the last systems innovation.

00:33:23.810 --> 00:33:27.140
And you know the Elon
Musk story, if you buy it,

00:33:27.140 --> 00:33:30.830
is very much a story of
bringing together synergies.

00:33:30.830 --> 00:33:33.741
A second group is people
with political connections,

00:33:33.741 --> 00:33:35.990
if you think it's important
to influence these things.

00:33:35.990 --> 00:33:38.510
So this is Neelie Kroes,
European commissioner,

00:33:38.510 --> 00:33:41.690
who was taken on in a role
in Uber, where clearly he's

00:33:41.690 --> 00:33:43.400
working out some
of these issues.

00:33:43.400 --> 00:33:45.740
The contestedness of some
of Uber's very valuable

00:33:45.740 --> 00:33:49.726
intangible assets is
a big salient point.

00:33:49.726 --> 00:33:51.350
There's also kind of
a thing where just

00:33:51.350 --> 00:33:53.462
traditional desk jobs,
which people often

00:33:53.462 --> 00:33:55.670
think will get abolished,
will become more important.

00:33:55.670 --> 00:33:58.460
Robert Reich, the US economist,
wrote a book a long time ago,

00:33:58.460 --> 00:34:00.470
where he talked about
symbolic analysts, people

00:34:00.470 --> 00:34:04.370
who make sense of stuff going
on in capitalism in the world.

00:34:04.370 --> 00:34:06.660
They're probably going to
get more important as well.

00:34:06.660 --> 00:34:09.118
And then also, there's kind of
a question about leadership.

00:34:09.118 --> 00:34:12.239
I remember, McKinsey used to
talk about the war for talent

00:34:12.239 --> 00:34:13.429
back in the 1990s.

00:34:13.429 --> 00:34:15.710
And obviously, the
cult with leadership

00:34:15.710 --> 00:34:17.544
continues, but to the
extent that leadership

00:34:17.544 --> 00:34:19.334
is about bringing
together these synergies,

00:34:19.334 --> 00:34:20.630
about addressing these issues.

00:34:20.630 --> 00:34:23.870
That would make sense why it's
been growing in importance

00:34:23.870 --> 00:34:26.190
around the same time that
these intangible assets have

00:34:26.190 --> 00:34:28.810
been growing.

00:34:28.810 --> 00:34:32.697
It also means that cities
will become more important.

00:34:32.697 --> 00:34:34.030
This is one of the many stories.

00:34:34.030 --> 00:34:36.071
I saw one on the front
page of the "Mercury News"

00:34:36.071 --> 00:34:38.290
today, about how San
Francisco, and by

00:34:38.290 --> 00:34:40.360
extension Silicon
Valley, have become

00:34:40.360 --> 00:34:41.977
tough places to afford housing.

00:34:41.977 --> 00:34:43.810
I don't probably need
to tell you guys that.

00:34:43.810 --> 00:34:47.469
We have similar things in
the UK, in parts of the UK.

00:34:47.469 --> 00:34:49.150
But one thing this
does mean, cities

00:34:49.150 --> 00:34:51.550
are places where the
spillovers are realized,

00:34:51.550 --> 00:34:52.888
where synergies take place.

00:34:52.888 --> 00:34:55.179
People talked about the death
of distance 30 years ago.

00:34:55.179 --> 00:34:57.387
But so far, the death of
distance, for the most part,

00:34:57.387 --> 00:34:58.300
hasn't happened.

00:34:58.300 --> 00:35:01.180
So weirdly, in an economy
based on intangibles,

00:35:01.180 --> 00:35:03.370
where you want to bring
these ideas together,

00:35:03.370 --> 00:35:08.190
physical places, physical
places where people interact,

00:35:08.190 --> 00:35:09.637
will become more important.

00:35:09.637 --> 00:35:12.220
And it does mean, you know, if
we take the democratic decision

00:35:12.220 --> 00:35:14.380
that we want to have very
strict planning laws,

00:35:14.380 --> 00:35:16.030
but we don't want
to build very much--

00:35:16.030 --> 00:35:17.774
we want to make it
hard to own houses--

00:35:17.774 --> 00:35:19.690
that choice will become
a more and more costly

00:35:19.690 --> 00:35:22.430
choice, as time goes by.

00:35:22.430 --> 00:35:24.350
There's a kind of
interesting twist here.

00:35:24.350 --> 00:35:26.070
Some of you will
have no doubt read

00:35:26.070 --> 00:35:28.090
Thomas Piketty's
"Capital," which

00:35:28.090 --> 00:35:30.250
talks about the massive
rise of inequality

00:35:30.250 --> 00:35:32.330
over the past few decades.

00:35:32.330 --> 00:35:35.350
One of the commentaries on
this by Matt Ronglie at MIT,

00:35:35.350 --> 00:35:37.510
and by some other
French economists,

00:35:37.510 --> 00:35:40.090
pointed out that a
big chunk of the rise

00:35:40.090 --> 00:35:43.240
of the wealth of the richest
people that Piketty documented

00:35:43.240 --> 00:35:45.130
was actually the rise
in housing prices.

00:35:45.130 --> 00:35:47.860
And there are many drivers of
that, including interest rates,

00:35:47.860 --> 00:35:48.700
and so forth.

00:35:48.700 --> 00:35:52.290
But it's notable that where
that property tends to be

00:35:52.290 --> 00:35:54.820
is in these places where
the intangible happens.

00:35:54.820 --> 00:35:57.520
There's a very curious
link between intangibles

00:35:57.520 --> 00:36:02.620
and this very tangible form of
inequality of property wealth.

00:36:02.620 --> 00:36:05.020
Cities also are becoming
more sectorally diverse.

00:36:05.020 --> 00:36:07.420
And there's a kind of Silicon
Valley application here.

00:36:07.420 --> 00:36:09.470
This is Youngstown,
Ohio, a classic steel

00:36:09.470 --> 00:36:11.350
town from the
early 20th century,

00:36:11.350 --> 00:36:13.260
and clusters in the old days.

00:36:13.260 --> 00:36:14.500
Economists love clusters.

00:36:14.500 --> 00:36:16.600
But clusters in the old
days were very often

00:36:16.600 --> 00:36:20.560
places where people
specialized in one industry.

00:36:20.560 --> 00:36:22.211
It seems that because
of the synergies,

00:36:22.211 --> 00:36:23.710
there is some
evidence that clusters

00:36:23.710 --> 00:36:24.910
are becoming more diverse.

00:36:24.910 --> 00:36:26.980
This is some work by Shane
Greenstein at Harvard,

00:36:26.980 --> 00:36:30.520
who looked at the Bay Area, and
how innovation in the Bay Area

00:36:30.520 --> 00:36:31.180
was changing.

00:36:31.180 --> 00:36:32.650
The Bay Area is the blue line.

00:36:32.650 --> 00:36:34.600
The other clusters
are in other lines.

00:36:34.600 --> 00:36:37.480
And not only is the Bay Area
responsible for more and more

00:36:37.480 --> 00:36:40.790
patenting in the US, it's also
responsible for more and more

00:36:40.790 --> 00:36:43.570
non-attack, or
non-ICT patenting,

00:36:43.570 --> 00:36:45.250
which one
interpretation of which

00:36:45.250 --> 00:36:47.290
is that clusters are
becoming more diverse.

00:36:47.290 --> 00:36:49.540
It's not just that you've
got to have a cluster that's

00:36:49.540 --> 00:36:52.120
really good at semiconductors,
or really good at fashion.

00:36:52.120 --> 00:36:57.809
But actually, you now need to
be a cluster of everything.

00:36:57.809 --> 00:36:59.350
And this kind of
creates some trouble

00:36:59.350 --> 00:37:04.000
for small towns, which are
kind of historic embattled.

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:05.650
This rise of liberal
citadels-- this

00:37:05.650 --> 00:37:08.890
was the "New York Times's"
graphic of Clinton's America.

00:37:08.890 --> 00:37:12.730
This shows that some of
these economic divides

00:37:12.730 --> 00:37:16.630
seem to be very intermingled
with the cultural divides

00:37:16.630 --> 00:37:20.330
that lie behind
populist politics.

00:37:20.330 --> 00:37:23.260
We think that part of the
rise of populism maybe being

00:37:23.260 --> 00:37:25.990
influenced by the fact
that the economic divisions

00:37:25.990 --> 00:37:28.480
between thriving cities
are kind of very related

00:37:28.480 --> 00:37:29.590
to the cultural divisions.

00:37:29.590 --> 00:37:31.570
And we can talk about
some of the psychology

00:37:31.570 --> 00:37:34.750
behind that in the
Q&amp;A, if that's helpful.

00:37:34.750 --> 00:37:39.080
My pitch for what this means
from a tech point of view--

00:37:39.080 --> 00:37:43.420
the mother of all demos was
obviously a huge step forward

00:37:43.420 --> 00:37:47.260
in distance killing technologies
like videoconferencing

00:37:47.260 --> 00:37:48.014
50 plus years ago.

00:37:48.014 --> 00:37:49.930
I think that's kind of--
the death of distance

00:37:49.930 --> 00:37:51.040
clearly has not happened.

00:37:51.040 --> 00:37:53.950
But there is kind of a question,
well, at some point, perhaps,

00:37:53.950 --> 00:37:55.660
distance will die.

00:37:55.660 --> 00:37:56.380
Will it be VR?

00:37:56.380 --> 00:37:58.600
Will it be some kind of
collaboration software?

00:37:58.600 --> 00:38:00.040
An old colleague
of mine has just

00:38:00.040 --> 00:38:02.206
written a book called
"Collective Intelligence," how

00:38:02.206 --> 00:38:04.990
people come together
in different ways.

00:38:04.990 --> 00:38:08.710
This is if one could
succeed at doing this,

00:38:08.710 --> 00:38:12.250
at really creating those kind
of genuine economic clusters

00:38:12.250 --> 00:38:16.344
at distance, it would
transform not just the economy,

00:38:16.344 --> 00:38:18.010
but it would transform
politics as well.

00:38:18.010 --> 00:38:23.812
So for me, that's a non-obvious
[INAUDIBLE] project.

00:38:23.812 --> 00:38:25.770
What all of this means
is an intangible economy

00:38:25.770 --> 00:38:28.590
is one where inequality
is potentially higher.

00:38:28.590 --> 00:38:30.840
So we talked about
wealth inequality.

00:38:30.840 --> 00:38:32.640
A ton of this comes
from property prices.

00:38:32.640 --> 00:38:34.130
And as we've said,
property prices

00:38:34.130 --> 00:38:36.171
are driven by this kind
of rise in global cities,

00:38:36.171 --> 00:38:38.280
those places where
intangibles happen.

00:38:38.280 --> 00:38:40.470
Income inequality-- there's
some really interesting

00:38:40.470 --> 00:38:42.930
recent research showing that
income inequality is driven

00:38:42.930 --> 00:38:45.930
as much by the gaps between the
performance of different firms

00:38:45.930 --> 00:38:48.840
as by performance between
different workers.

00:38:48.840 --> 00:38:51.090
And if that's the
case, then this rising

00:38:51.090 --> 00:38:53.280
gap between the leader and
the laggard firms that we

00:38:53.280 --> 00:38:56.394
talked about earlier, seems to
be a really important driver.

00:38:56.394 --> 00:38:57.810
And then we talked
about this kind

00:38:57.810 --> 00:39:00.390
of status inequality,
inequality of esteem, the fact

00:39:00.390 --> 00:39:02.040
that in many rich
countries, there's

00:39:02.040 --> 00:39:03.780
a group of people
who basically feels

00:39:03.780 --> 00:39:05.790
that the elite disrespect them.

00:39:05.790 --> 00:39:10.380
And that's more of a
problem than it used to be.

00:39:10.380 --> 00:39:12.870
This kind of-- to us,
the fact that you've

00:39:12.870 --> 00:39:17.070
got these cultural and
economic causes of inequality

00:39:17.070 --> 00:39:19.800
intermingling, seems
to have, for us,

00:39:19.800 --> 00:39:24.500
given some explanation for why
this problem is getting worse.

00:39:24.500 --> 00:39:26.420
I'm going to talk
quickly about what

00:39:26.420 --> 00:39:28.670
governments, and what public
policy, might want to do.

00:39:28.670 --> 00:39:31.970
And then we're going to
throw it open to questions.

00:39:31.970 --> 00:39:33.760
One, I think, big
question is whether this

00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:37.370
may very well create a stronger
argument for public investment.

00:39:37.370 --> 00:39:40.720
This is a chart from some
of Jonathan's research,

00:39:40.720 --> 00:39:46.540
showing the share of
government publicly funded R&amp;D

00:39:46.540 --> 00:39:50.140
against investment in
intangibles in the wider

00:39:50.140 --> 00:39:50.754
economy.

00:39:50.754 --> 00:39:53.170
There's some evidence that
there's some correlation there.

00:39:53.170 --> 00:39:56.170
So government investment
crowds in private investments

00:39:56.170 --> 00:39:58.196
in intangibles.

00:39:58.196 --> 00:40:00.070
So we think there's a
strong case for saying,

00:40:00.070 --> 00:40:01.330
this will be more important.

00:40:01.330 --> 00:40:02.950
You might expect
this share to rise.

00:40:02.950 --> 00:40:04.420
And given this
line, it's probably

00:40:04.420 --> 00:40:05.734
going to continue to increase.

00:40:05.734 --> 00:40:07.150
That's just more
public investment

00:40:07.150 --> 00:40:09.108
as a proportion of the
economy over time, which

00:40:09.108 --> 00:40:11.150
can be pretty significant.

00:40:11.150 --> 00:40:13.750
However, speaking as a
public policy person,

00:40:13.750 --> 00:40:16.390
there's a lot we need to learn
about how to do this well.

00:40:16.390 --> 00:40:19.446
Governments are reasonably good
at investing in academic R&amp;D.

00:40:19.446 --> 00:40:20.820
And basic science
had a long time

00:40:20.820 --> 00:40:22.440
to think about how to do that.

00:40:22.440 --> 00:40:23.950
But investing in
other intangibles,

00:40:23.950 --> 00:40:26.920
like training or design
through procurement,

00:40:26.920 --> 00:40:28.100
is something trickier.

00:40:28.100 --> 00:40:30.190
It's very interesting to
see somewhere like Paris,

00:40:30.190 --> 00:40:31.773
where the government
has set up a kind

00:40:31.773 --> 00:40:35.590
of publicly owned Uber-style
clone called My Taxi.

00:40:35.590 --> 00:40:38.719
It's an example of an intangible
based publicly owned business.

00:40:38.719 --> 00:40:39.760
Is that the way to do it?

00:40:39.760 --> 00:40:40.510
Maybe.

00:40:40.510 --> 00:40:42.710
Is it to create more open
data, which is effectively

00:40:42.710 --> 00:40:44.590
another publicly provided asset.

00:40:44.590 --> 00:40:45.500
Maybe it's that.

00:40:45.500 --> 00:40:47.370
But I think we're
feeling our way in a way

00:40:47.370 --> 00:40:49.810
that with publicly
funded research,

00:40:49.810 --> 00:40:53.570
we kind of know more about
what's going on there.

00:40:53.570 --> 00:40:55.000
The other big
question, we talked

00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:56.916
about these big cultural
and political divides

00:40:56.916 --> 00:40:58.420
in the age of populism.

00:40:58.420 --> 00:41:01.160
If you want to make the case
for more public investment,

00:41:01.160 --> 00:41:03.550
how do you do that in a world
where political legitimacy

00:41:03.550 --> 00:41:05.657
is diminished?

00:41:05.657 --> 00:41:07.990
I think that kind of leads
us onto the question of well,

00:41:07.990 --> 00:41:11.890
do we need new institutions
for an intangible economy?

00:41:11.890 --> 00:41:13.900
The first Industrial
Revolution gave rise

00:41:13.900 --> 00:41:16.730
to all sorts of institutions
and social technologies,

00:41:16.730 --> 00:41:19.330
whether it was the time
clock and the kind of labor

00:41:19.330 --> 00:41:22.360
discipline, whether it was
mutual aid and insurance,

00:41:22.360 --> 00:41:25.089
to try and kind of
manage the needs

00:41:25.089 --> 00:41:27.130
of an industrial workforce,
whether it was things

00:41:27.130 --> 00:41:28.880
like mass production,
where we see there's

00:41:28.880 --> 00:41:30.910
a big literature on
how electrification led

00:41:30.910 --> 00:41:32.860
to an entire change
in the way factories

00:41:32.860 --> 00:41:35.540
and manufacturing was organized.

00:41:35.540 --> 00:41:38.260
So typically, these big
technological changes

00:41:38.260 --> 00:41:40.510
in how the economy works
have been really fecund

00:41:40.510 --> 00:41:43.000
for social innovation and
institutions that have

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:44.560
arisen hand-in-hand with them.

00:41:44.560 --> 00:41:47.890
So there is kind of question
well, what else do we need?

00:41:47.890 --> 00:41:49.730
One question for
me is, how do we

00:41:49.730 --> 00:41:53.470
internalize these spillovers
of intangible investments?

00:41:53.470 --> 00:41:56.950
So I talked about Godfrey
Hounsfield, the CT scanner guy.

00:41:56.950 --> 00:42:00.280
And although EMI did
really badly out of that,

00:42:00.280 --> 00:42:01.160
he did really well.

00:42:01.160 --> 00:42:02.710
Because the queen
gave him a knighthood,

00:42:02.710 --> 00:42:04.501
and he was the fellow
of the Royal Society,

00:42:04.501 --> 00:42:06.010
and he got a Nobel Prize.

00:42:06.010 --> 00:42:08.260
That is one way of doing it.

00:42:08.260 --> 00:42:14.440
Society can reward people with
honors of one sort or another.

00:42:14.440 --> 00:42:18.460
But that's a very kind
of 1960s vision, or early

00:42:18.460 --> 00:42:19.810
20th century vision.

00:42:19.810 --> 00:42:22.530
So one question we often
get asked is, are there

00:42:22.530 --> 00:42:24.310
blockchain applications here?

00:42:24.310 --> 00:42:26.410
I think it's compulsory
in these kind of talks

00:42:26.410 --> 00:42:27.910
to mention blockchain
at some point.

00:42:27.910 --> 00:42:29.955
And that's all I will do.

00:42:29.955 --> 00:42:32.080
But I'm also fascinated by
some of the things, some

00:42:32.080 --> 00:42:34.204
of the experiments, that
China are putting in place

00:42:34.204 --> 00:42:35.830
in terms of social credit.

00:42:35.830 --> 00:42:38.110
Clearly, there's a lot of
political economy questions

00:42:38.110 --> 00:42:39.130
related to that.

00:42:39.130 --> 00:42:42.430
But I see a lot of very
interesting social innovation

00:42:42.430 --> 00:42:45.050
experiments coming out of China.

00:42:45.050 --> 00:42:47.050
And finally, how do
you build these things

00:42:47.050 --> 00:42:48.994
in a more fractured society?

00:42:48.994 --> 00:42:50.160
I'm going to leave it there.

00:42:50.160 --> 00:42:51.340
There are some copies
of the book here.

00:42:51.340 --> 00:42:53.006
We talk about all
sorts of other things.

00:42:53.006 --> 00:42:55.915
We talk a bit about Brexit and
Trump and medieval history.

00:42:55.915 --> 00:42:59.030
I try and get as much medieval
history into books as I can.

00:42:59.030 --> 00:43:04.150
And yeah, we're kind
of open to questions.

00:43:04.150 --> 00:43:05.587
So thank you.

00:43:05.587 --> 00:43:08.736
[APPLAUSE]

00:43:08.736 --> 00:43:09.610
SPEAKER 1: OK, great.

00:43:12.651 --> 00:43:14.400
AUDIENCE: First of
all, thanks for coming.

00:43:14.400 --> 00:43:15.510
Certainly, interesting.

00:43:15.510 --> 00:43:17.670
And I think very,
very important.

00:43:17.670 --> 00:43:20.833
One observation and
also a question.

00:43:20.833 --> 00:43:23.440
They're related.

00:43:23.440 --> 00:43:26.910
The chart that you
showed earlier about-- it

00:43:26.910 --> 00:43:31.410
was about the increase
of intangible value

00:43:31.410 --> 00:43:32.040
in the economy.

00:43:32.040 --> 00:43:32.920
It was very linear.

00:43:32.920 --> 00:43:37.920
And my own thought on it is
that we may actually and should

00:43:37.920 --> 00:43:40.950
be on the precipice of an
inflection point with AI

00:43:40.950 --> 00:43:42.480
and laws of automation.

00:43:42.480 --> 00:43:44.880
And so I'd be interested
in your thoughts.

00:43:44.880 --> 00:43:47.700
Secondly, there
was a book recently

00:43:47.700 --> 00:43:50.500
written-- you may be
familiar with-- by Kate

00:43:50.500 --> 00:43:52.680
Raworth, "Doughnut Economics."

00:43:52.680 --> 00:43:57.600
And in it, she argues
that we should not

00:43:57.600 --> 00:43:59.760
be targeting economic growth.

00:43:59.760 --> 00:44:03.810
And in the traditional sense of
GDP, I think that's sensible.

00:44:03.810 --> 00:44:08.010
But Stian, for you,
how is the type

00:44:08.010 --> 00:44:11.550
of thinking that you guys are
talking about being integrated

00:44:11.550 --> 00:44:14.895
into national measures so
that people will be satisfied

00:44:14.895 --> 00:44:17.520
that the economies are growing,
but it's not in nuts and bolts?

00:44:21.070 --> 00:44:24.290
JONATHAN HASKEL: So thank
you for the question.

00:44:24.290 --> 00:44:25.940
Just quickly on AI.

00:44:25.940 --> 00:44:29.636
I mean, one view of AI--

00:44:29.636 --> 00:44:32.930
listen, I'm talking to a room
who is incredibly well-informed

00:44:32.930 --> 00:44:35.357
about this, so I
slightly hesitate here--

00:44:35.357 --> 00:44:37.190
is that it is somewhat
of an example of what

00:44:37.190 --> 00:44:38.160
we're talking about.

00:44:38.160 --> 00:44:40.640
So if I think about
some of what I

00:44:40.640 --> 00:44:42.380
read about machine
learning and AI,

00:44:42.380 --> 00:44:45.370
it consists of incredibly
fast computers.

00:44:45.370 --> 00:44:47.420
So that's the tangible bit.

00:44:47.420 --> 00:44:50.150
Interrogating
gigantic databases.

00:44:50.150 --> 00:44:51.560
I mentioned
databases earlier on.

00:44:51.560 --> 00:44:53.450
That's like an
intangible bit as well.

00:44:53.450 --> 00:44:56.450
Using fantastic software,
which does that interrogation

00:44:56.450 --> 00:44:58.520
amazingly quickly
to recognize faces,

00:44:58.520 --> 00:45:00.840
and cats, and tables, and
all those various things.

00:45:00.840 --> 00:45:03.860
So in a sense, I guess--

00:45:03.860 --> 00:45:05.540
if I can put an
intangible spin on it,

00:45:05.540 --> 00:45:07.130
it is precisely
the kind of blend

00:45:07.130 --> 00:45:11.690
of the tangibles with the
intangibles that you see.

00:45:11.690 --> 00:45:13.902
That's one way of
thinking about it.

00:45:13.902 --> 00:45:15.860
As far just quickly as
the "Doughnut Economics"

00:45:15.860 --> 00:45:19.310
is concerned, I mean, the
"Doughnut Economics" book--

00:45:19.310 --> 00:45:21.740
I don't know if Kate Raworth
has come to give a talk here,

00:45:21.740 --> 00:45:25.340
but it's essentially a kind
of very anti-economist's book.

00:45:25.340 --> 00:45:28.059
So, of course, as a
card-carrying economist,

00:45:28.059 --> 00:45:30.100
I find it quite an annoying
book in that respect.

00:45:30.100 --> 00:45:31.250
But challenge is good.

00:45:31.250 --> 00:45:33.710
So you know, we ought to
be reading all of this.

00:45:33.710 --> 00:45:37.440
I think her core
message in that book

00:45:37.440 --> 00:45:40.580
is very much along the lines
that we mustn't neglect

00:45:40.580 --> 00:45:43.929
the environment if we have
economic growth at all costs,

00:45:43.929 --> 00:45:46.220
we'll have pollution and all
these very terrible things

00:45:46.220 --> 00:45:47.390
and all that kind of thing.

00:45:47.390 --> 00:45:51.410
Along the side,
she criticizes GDP

00:45:51.410 --> 00:45:54.420
as being an absolutely
terrible measure of anything.

00:45:54.420 --> 00:45:57.050
And at that point, I would take
a little bit of issue with her,

00:45:57.050 --> 00:45:59.480
but I think it relates to
your question about how

00:45:59.480 --> 00:46:01.100
we can build all of this.

00:46:01.100 --> 00:46:03.880
I think our view when we talked
about this in the Indigo Prize

00:46:03.880 --> 00:46:07.084
that David kindly mentioned
is that what we want to do

00:46:07.084 --> 00:46:08.750
is we want to bring
this stuff into GDP.

00:46:08.750 --> 00:46:11.360
And so make GDP more
reflective of these types

00:46:11.360 --> 00:46:14.660
of intangible investments,
which it currently is not.

00:46:14.660 --> 00:46:17.610
So a bit of a slight crusade
for GDP in some ways,

00:46:17.610 --> 00:46:20.870
but making it more relevant to
the type of intangible economy

00:46:20.870 --> 00:46:22.748
that is being built
in this very building.

00:46:27.002 --> 00:46:27.543
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:46:27.543 --> 00:46:31.687
I wanted to ask about the
economic history of this.

00:46:31.687 --> 00:46:33.270
So you showed a chart
at the beginning

00:46:33.270 --> 00:46:35.400
that showed the intangible
economy sort of starting

00:46:35.400 --> 00:46:38.400
to rise in the 1940s and 1930s.

00:46:38.400 --> 00:46:41.280
So yeah, just wanted
you to speculate on what

00:46:41.280 --> 00:46:44.260
the causes of those could be.

00:46:44.260 --> 00:46:46.360
STIAN WESTLAKE: So that's
a really good question.

00:46:46.360 --> 00:46:48.990
It's something we sort of
mull over a bit in the book

00:46:48.990 --> 00:46:51.840
and we don't have
an absolute answer.

00:46:51.840 --> 00:46:55.530
I don't know if anyone reads
Cosma Shalizi's various blog

00:46:55.530 --> 00:46:57.600
posts, a guy in
Santa Fe Institute.

00:46:57.600 --> 00:47:00.930
He has this wonderful theory
that the singularity actually

00:47:00.930 --> 00:47:03.420
happened in the
late 19th century.

00:47:03.420 --> 00:47:06.630
If what we mean is technological
acceleration causing

00:47:06.630 --> 00:47:09.040
an emergent system to basically
have a life of its own.

00:47:09.040 --> 00:47:11.610
So his argument is
that modern capitalism,

00:47:11.610 --> 00:47:13.110
the singularity has
already happened

00:47:13.110 --> 00:47:15.109
and all these technologies
are actually the kind

00:47:15.109 --> 00:47:17.640
of the manifestation of that.

00:47:17.640 --> 00:47:22.030
To be slightly less
speculative about it,

00:47:22.030 --> 00:47:26.730
I think there is a sense in
which the nature of modern

00:47:26.730 --> 00:47:31.410
capitalism-- and by modern, I
mean sort of since about 1850--

00:47:31.410 --> 00:47:34.530
just demands a huge
amount of organization

00:47:34.530 --> 00:47:37.750
of not just ideas, but
relationships between people.

00:47:37.750 --> 00:47:39.370
Whether that's
customers and producers

00:47:39.370 --> 00:47:42.750
or whether it's producers
and supply chain and workers.

00:47:42.750 --> 00:47:44.430
And what the intangible
economy is doing

00:47:44.430 --> 00:47:45.690
is it's picking that up.

00:47:45.690 --> 00:47:47.910
This is the kind of
accretion of stuff

00:47:47.910 --> 00:47:52.440
that is in some fundamental way
very essential to capitalism.

00:47:52.440 --> 00:47:55.230
Now, obviously, although we
kind of said, well, maybe this

00:47:55.230 --> 00:47:58.050
came first rather than
IT, IT is hugely important

00:47:58.050 --> 00:48:00.740
because it's very
complementary to these things.

00:48:00.740 --> 00:48:05.910
You can't have software
in any meaningful sense

00:48:05.910 --> 00:48:08.190
without the technological
infrastructure

00:48:08.190 --> 00:48:09.736
to run the software on.

00:48:09.736 --> 00:48:12.780
IT in various sorts makes
it a lot easier to record

00:48:12.780 --> 00:48:15.930
and build and accumulate
these relationships.

00:48:15.930 --> 00:48:18.700
So there's definitely a
complementarity there.

00:48:18.700 --> 00:48:21.510
Another thing that's
kind of interesting to me

00:48:21.510 --> 00:48:23.520
is that if you look
at the relationship

00:48:23.520 --> 00:48:27.300
between regulation, like labor
market regulation and product

00:48:27.300 --> 00:48:29.220
regulation by country.

00:48:29.220 --> 00:48:32.760
And you look at intangible
investment in relation to that,

00:48:32.760 --> 00:48:34.980
less regulation
of those sorts is

00:48:34.980 --> 00:48:37.170
linked with more
intangible investment.

00:48:37.170 --> 00:48:39.160
And the kind of intuition
there that people

00:48:39.160 --> 00:48:41.730
like Erik Brynjolfsson and John
Van Reenen have talked about

00:48:41.730 --> 00:48:44.820
is that if you want to
invest in new ideas,

00:48:44.820 --> 00:48:46.840
buying new products, new
ways of doing things,

00:48:46.840 --> 00:48:49.020
it's potentially easier to do if
you have a more flexible labor

00:48:49.020 --> 00:48:51.000
market, if you have
product markets that

00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:53.610
are more friendly to
disruption in your markets.

00:48:53.610 --> 00:48:55.500
So there is kind of one
other possible driver

00:48:55.500 --> 00:48:58.620
that since about 1980, many
of the world's economies

00:48:58.620 --> 00:49:00.900
have been on a kind
of deregulatory path.

00:49:00.900 --> 00:49:03.300
And it's possible that
some of those things

00:49:03.300 --> 00:49:05.410
may have also increased
this investment.

00:49:05.410 --> 00:49:06.930
There may be
diminishing returns.

00:49:06.930 --> 00:49:09.430
We're not saying that you should
have no regulations at all.

00:49:09.430 --> 00:49:12.030
But it may be that some
combination of ICT,

00:49:12.030 --> 00:49:15.060
just the general
trajectory of capitalism,

00:49:15.060 --> 00:49:17.803
and the regulatory,
the political economy,

00:49:17.803 --> 00:49:19.386
might have been
driving that increase.

00:49:19.386 --> 00:49:20.585
We don't know.

00:49:26.640 --> 00:49:30.210
AUDIENCE: I wanted to
comment that there is--

00:49:30.210 --> 00:49:31.930
that traditionally,
we sort of think

00:49:31.930 --> 00:49:34.550
of companies as
containers of value.

00:49:34.550 --> 00:49:38.680
And one of the things that we've
seen in the last 30 years or so

00:49:38.680 --> 00:49:42.940
is the rise of open source where
some participants are actually

00:49:42.940 --> 00:49:45.740
militantly opposed to
being called a company.

00:49:45.740 --> 00:49:47.890
And yet, you want
to measure somehow

00:49:47.890 --> 00:49:51.120
what they are contributing.

00:49:51.120 --> 00:49:55.180
Have there been any
efforts to measure like--

00:49:55.180 --> 00:49:59.560
for example, for the Free
Software Foundation, what

00:49:59.560 --> 00:50:01.720
the value of their
intellectual capital

00:50:01.720 --> 00:50:06.228
is, even without their
participation necessarily?

00:50:06.228 --> 00:50:08.850
JONATHAN HASKEL: Yeah,
it's a great question.

00:50:08.850 --> 00:50:12.796
And in a sense, some of these
interesting and difficult

00:50:12.796 --> 00:50:15.170
properties that we were talking
about of these intangible

00:50:15.170 --> 00:50:17.611
assets call into question
traditional measurement

00:50:17.611 --> 00:50:18.110
methods.

00:50:18.110 --> 00:50:22.610
So the traditional measurement
method around software

00:50:22.610 --> 00:50:25.370
is to go out and find out how
many software engineers are

00:50:25.370 --> 00:50:27.790
working and figure out
their costs and all of that.

00:50:27.790 --> 00:50:30.260
And from that, back
out some kind of notion

00:50:30.260 --> 00:50:32.660
about how much firms are
investing in new software.

00:50:32.660 --> 00:50:35.270
But of course, if it's
open source software,

00:50:35.270 --> 00:50:37.670
and it's being
written by some group,

00:50:37.670 --> 00:50:39.560
and then other people
are benefiting from it,

00:50:39.560 --> 00:50:41.870
as we were just
talking about, then you

00:50:41.870 --> 00:50:45.680
understate the types
of benefit that

00:50:45.680 --> 00:50:48.680
come from that kind of endeavor
in a very substantial kind

00:50:48.680 --> 00:50:49.260
of way.

00:50:49.260 --> 00:50:51.350
So again, it's one of
the peculiar features

00:50:51.350 --> 00:50:53.990
of intangible assets that
make this whole project very

00:50:53.990 --> 00:50:55.300
difficult.

00:50:55.300 --> 00:50:57.080
So statistical
agencies, accountants

00:50:57.080 --> 00:50:58.600
aren't bothering with
any of this stuff at all.

00:50:58.600 --> 00:51:00.725
National income accountants
in statistical agencies

00:51:00.725 --> 00:51:02.984
are trying, but they come
up against these kinds

00:51:02.984 --> 00:51:03.650
of difficulties.

00:51:03.650 --> 00:51:06.020
But almost certainly, those
kinds of contributions

00:51:06.020 --> 00:51:07.305
are understated in that way.

00:51:07.305 --> 00:51:08.180
STIAN WESTLAKE: Yeah.

00:51:08.180 --> 00:51:11.660
The whole question of how you
measure the kind of economy

00:51:11.660 --> 00:51:13.430
outside firms is
something that I think

00:51:13.430 --> 00:51:16.400
is a really tough and
important problem.

00:51:16.400 --> 00:51:17.810
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:51:17.810 --> 00:51:20.370
AUDIENCE: Thanks for the talk.

00:51:20.370 --> 00:51:22.870
I think I have a question kind
of little bit related to One

00:51:22.870 --> 00:51:23.911
of the earlier questions.

00:51:23.911 --> 00:51:28.490
So we talked about how certain
problems, like the income gap

00:51:28.490 --> 00:51:31.282
or wealth gap or even like
happiness kind of stuff

00:51:31.282 --> 00:51:32.990
is kind of really
getting worse and worse

00:51:32.990 --> 00:51:35.520
with like the evolution
of the economy.

00:51:35.520 --> 00:51:37.790
So I'm just curious
like, do we see

00:51:37.790 --> 00:51:41.180
like a trend of evolving
our economy as a society

00:51:41.180 --> 00:51:43.490
to kind of make
these things better?

00:51:43.490 --> 00:51:45.710
Are we kind of
evolving our economy,

00:51:45.710 --> 00:51:49.160
but being a little vigilant
of the cons of capitalism,

00:51:49.160 --> 00:51:52.730
or even like theories of
people, like Émile Durkheim,

00:51:52.730 --> 00:51:54.946
or are we really destined
to failure through our own

00:51:54.946 --> 00:51:55.445
success?

00:51:58.370 --> 00:52:00.950
STIAN WESTLAKE: I
mean, if we come back

00:52:00.950 --> 00:52:05.810
to this question of GDP
growth, is it good for us?

00:52:05.810 --> 00:52:08.924
I guess there is quite
a bit of good news

00:52:08.924 --> 00:52:10.840
that doesn't get talked
about in the critique.

00:52:10.840 --> 00:52:13.610
So if we think about the UN's
Human Development Index, which

00:52:13.610 --> 00:52:16.700
is a kind of very earnest
attempt to measure

00:52:16.700 --> 00:52:20.300
what really matters
for humans, that's

00:52:20.300 --> 00:52:22.732
extremely highly
correlated with GDP.

00:52:22.732 --> 00:52:24.440
So there's definitely
some sense in which

00:52:24.440 --> 00:52:28.640
GDP growth is associated
with these good things.

00:52:28.640 --> 00:52:30.380
Economic growth seems
to be associated

00:52:30.380 --> 00:52:33.590
with things like greater
tolerance on the whole

00:52:33.590 --> 00:52:38.110
and with paradoxically
environmental protection

00:52:38.110 --> 00:52:39.890
So as countries get
rich, or often they

00:52:39.890 --> 00:52:42.049
stop chopping down trees
and start planting them

00:52:42.049 --> 00:52:42.590
and so forth.

00:52:42.590 --> 00:52:44.930
That's not to say that
things like climate change

00:52:44.930 --> 00:52:47.120
aren't significant
challenges to the economy,

00:52:47.120 --> 00:52:53.940
but it does give some-- it's
some reason not to despair.

00:52:53.940 --> 00:52:56.490
I think some of these questions,
like the rise of inequality,

00:52:56.490 --> 00:52:58.948
particularly if it's driven by
these changes in the capital

00:52:58.948 --> 00:53:02.640
stock that otherwise are kind
of useful and productive,

00:53:02.640 --> 00:53:04.585
I think that really
is important.

00:53:04.585 --> 00:53:06.920
And my take-- and you know,
Jonathon's the economist.

00:53:06.920 --> 00:53:08.180
I'm the non-economist.

00:53:08.180 --> 00:53:10.720
My take is that that's the
legitimate domain of politics.

00:53:10.720 --> 00:53:11.600
That's what we
should be thinking

00:53:11.600 --> 00:53:13.360
about from a political
point of view

00:53:13.360 --> 00:53:17.690
and deciding consciously as a
society what choices we want

00:53:17.690 --> 00:53:20.300
to make around distribution.

00:53:20.300 --> 00:53:22.076
Just because the
economy is trending

00:53:22.076 --> 00:53:23.450
in a particular
dimension doesn't

00:53:23.450 --> 00:53:26.403
mean we can't intervene to
create the society we want.

00:53:26.403 --> 00:53:30.850
AUDIENCE: Or in fact, the point
I have is like, I do agree,

00:53:30.850 --> 00:53:34.510
this GDP growth-- or having
a number to kind of depict

00:53:34.510 --> 00:53:39.540
the overall status of how we are
growing in terms of technology

00:53:39.540 --> 00:53:42.320
or money, that's important.

00:53:42.320 --> 00:53:45.380
But then, I think more
often, like we actually

00:53:45.380 --> 00:53:47.319
see things very differently.

00:53:47.319 --> 00:53:49.110
Maybe it's a little
bit more philosophical,

00:53:49.110 --> 00:53:51.140
but we see when we
talk about economy,

00:53:51.140 --> 00:53:54.440
we just talk about
kind of strategies

00:53:54.440 --> 00:53:56.450
we should use to
grow, like our income

00:53:56.450 --> 00:54:00.750
levels or overall ability to
purchase, or things like that.

00:54:00.750 --> 00:54:03.560
While we kind of
totally not correlated

00:54:03.560 --> 00:54:05.960
with like the
corresponding changes

00:54:05.960 --> 00:54:08.270
in the behavior or
the social structure

00:54:08.270 --> 00:54:11.410
that happens when we are kind
of targeting certain things.

00:54:11.410 --> 00:54:14.050
So my point is I
think, don't we need

00:54:14.050 --> 00:54:16.550
to be like a little bit cautious
of the other stuff as well?

00:54:16.550 --> 00:54:19.490
So that while we are
really kind of targeting

00:54:19.490 --> 00:54:21.470
for like the overall
growth, maybe

00:54:21.470 --> 00:54:25.040
there are certain things that
we are not really considering,

00:54:25.040 --> 00:54:29.180
which are like a
byproduct of [INAUDIBLE]??

00:54:29.180 --> 00:54:31.180
JONATHAN HASKEL: Can I
try a reflection on that?

00:54:31.180 --> 00:54:32.780
And you tell me if I'm
not capturing your point.

00:54:32.780 --> 00:54:35.390
I mean, I think it's back to
the age-old argument about what

00:54:35.390 --> 00:54:36.770
technology does.

00:54:36.770 --> 00:54:39.380
So speaking as a
university academic,

00:54:39.380 --> 00:54:42.904
the invention of searching the
internet is fantastic for me

00:54:42.904 --> 00:54:44.820
because I can find this
paper, and this paper,

00:54:44.820 --> 00:54:45.945
and all that kind of thing.

00:54:45.945 --> 00:54:48.137
It's greatly improved
my job massively.

00:54:48.137 --> 00:54:49.970
On the other hand, if
you read, for example,

00:54:49.970 --> 00:54:51.890
"The Financial Times," their
employment correspondent,

00:54:51.890 --> 00:54:54.223
Sarah O'Connor, who's written
a series of articles about

00:54:54.223 --> 00:54:56.630
the Amazon warehouse, where
the invention of technology--

00:54:56.630 --> 00:54:58.970
the software for sort
of monitoring workers--

00:54:58.970 --> 00:55:00.900
seems to be
de-humanizing workers.

00:55:00.900 --> 00:55:03.030
I'm putting words
into [INAUDIBLE]..

00:55:03.030 --> 00:55:05.000
And these workers in
the Amazon warehouse

00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:07.914
are really having
quite a difficult time.

00:55:07.914 --> 00:55:09.830
Part of what your question
is pointing to is I

00:55:09.830 --> 00:55:12.740
think an age-old question
about whether technology

00:55:12.740 --> 00:55:14.990
might be a liberating
force for some workers,

00:55:14.990 --> 00:55:16.520
stopping them from
routine tasks,

00:55:16.520 --> 00:55:20.120
but then might be particularly
bad and oppressive

00:55:20.120 --> 00:55:21.390
for other types as well.

00:55:21.390 --> 00:55:23.679
That's a tough issue,
very tough issue.

00:55:27.412 --> 00:55:28.870
AUDIENCE: It seems,
at least to me,

00:55:28.870 --> 00:55:31.671
that the entertainment sector is
becoming a lot more intangible

00:55:31.671 --> 00:55:32.170
as well.

00:55:32.170 --> 00:55:35.760
For example, if I cancel my
cable subscription and web

00:55:35.760 --> 00:55:39.330
surf instead, it seems
a lot harder to measure.

00:55:39.330 --> 00:55:41.070
We do have ads and so forth.

00:55:41.070 --> 00:55:45.720
But I was curious, do you
think this is happening?

00:55:45.720 --> 00:55:47.520
If so, how can we
kind of measure

00:55:47.520 --> 00:55:50.389
this extremely intangible
entertainment value

00:55:50.389 --> 00:55:52.680
that people are getting
through all these hours they're

00:55:52.680 --> 00:55:56.500
web surfing on social
media and so forth?

00:55:56.500 --> 00:55:58.265
STIAN WESTLAKE: Do
you want to take that?

00:55:58.265 --> 00:55:59.640
JONATHAN HASKEL:
I mean, again, I

00:55:59.640 --> 00:56:02.700
think that's in the box of
a hard, hard measurement

00:56:02.700 --> 00:56:06.580
question, which people are
sort of struggling with.

00:56:06.580 --> 00:56:08.842
But you're right, the
entertainment industry--

00:56:08.842 --> 00:56:10.800
I mean, I think the way
that we think about it,

00:56:10.800 --> 00:56:12.220
but we see intangibles
everywhere,

00:56:12.220 --> 00:56:14.410
is this just bundle
of intangible assets.

00:56:14.410 --> 00:56:17.419
We talk in the book, for
example, about Harry Potter.

00:56:17.419 --> 00:56:18.960
As I was mentioning
before, Britain's

00:56:18.960 --> 00:56:20.910
most famous innovation
in many ways.

00:56:20.910 --> 00:56:23.160
It's not only the
script, but it's also

00:56:23.160 --> 00:56:24.360
the computer graphics.

00:56:24.360 --> 00:56:26.570
It's the set design and
all those kinds of things.

00:56:26.570 --> 00:56:29.380
So it's that kind of
bundle of things together,

00:56:29.380 --> 00:56:32.455
which creates a particularly
valuable type of asset.

00:56:32.455 --> 00:56:34.080
But of course, that
has to be delivered

00:56:34.080 --> 00:56:35.896
to people's houses via
broadband and cable

00:56:35.896 --> 00:56:37.770
and all that kind of
thing, about which there

00:56:37.770 --> 00:56:41.010
are many ownership
types of arguments.

00:56:41.010 --> 00:56:44.030
So there's a big policy area
about the delivery of it

00:56:44.030 --> 00:56:44.950
as well.

00:56:44.950 --> 00:56:46.800
STIAN WESTLAKE:
And I think there's

00:56:46.800 --> 00:56:50.530
two interesting questions there
arising from this intangible--

00:56:50.530 --> 00:56:52.560
sort of the increasing
intangibility.

00:56:52.560 --> 00:56:54.150
One of which is
kind of, how do you

00:56:54.150 --> 00:56:56.040
measure the stuff that
doesn't get paid for?

00:56:56.040 --> 00:56:58.350
It's a kind of
measurement question.

00:56:58.350 --> 00:57:00.270
At the same time,
there's a question

00:57:00.270 --> 00:57:04.170
which rights holders
and creators would ask,

00:57:04.170 --> 00:57:11.010
which is, how do you get some
payment for things that people

00:57:11.010 --> 00:57:12.460
are consuming and are enjoying?

00:57:12.460 --> 00:57:14.084
Which is as much a
question, going back

00:57:14.084 --> 00:57:15.384
to this kind of contestedness.

00:57:15.384 --> 00:57:16.550
What are the terms of trade?

00:57:16.550 --> 00:57:17.460
What are the rules?

00:57:17.460 --> 00:57:19.900
What are the rules
of these markets?

00:57:19.900 --> 00:57:23.955
I think they're both
pretty pressing questions.

00:57:23.955 --> 00:57:24.830
SPEAKER 1: OK, great.

00:57:24.830 --> 00:57:26.550
Last question.

00:57:26.550 --> 00:57:28.800
AUDIENCE: This isn't going
to be a very good question.

00:57:28.800 --> 00:57:30.100
I have a couple random
thoughts in my head,

00:57:30.100 --> 00:57:31.170
but I'm wondering if you can--

00:57:31.170 --> 00:57:32.730
because the purpose
will be for you guys

00:57:32.730 --> 00:57:34.170
to help stitch them
together, point me out

00:57:34.170 --> 00:57:35.310
where I'm conflicted.

00:57:35.310 --> 00:57:40.170
So the first one is it seems
to me like a reasonable claim

00:57:40.170 --> 00:57:43.230
to make would be that as our
economy gets more developed,

00:57:43.230 --> 00:57:46.130
it's gotten more specialized.

00:57:46.130 --> 00:57:49.040
And it seems like as it
gets more specialized,

00:57:49.040 --> 00:57:55.570
the distance between
any two workers grows.

00:57:55.570 --> 00:57:58.380
So the job that I do and
the job that he does--

00:57:58.380 --> 00:58:01.124
I have no idea who this guy is--

00:58:01.124 --> 00:58:03.600
is probably
functionally different.

00:58:03.600 --> 00:58:06.390
I don't think I could come
in and do his job tomorrow.

00:58:06.390 --> 00:58:08.580
I don't think he could come
and do my job tomorrow,

00:58:08.580 --> 00:58:12.510
because the context required
to do our specific tasks

00:58:12.510 --> 00:58:15.900
is actually not that
close to each other.

00:58:15.900 --> 00:58:17.720
So it seems like
the more specialized

00:58:17.720 --> 00:58:21.377
the economy gets, the kind
of, like I say, distance--

00:58:21.377 --> 00:58:23.960
I don't know what I'm actually
measuring-- gets further apart.

00:58:23.960 --> 00:58:27.660
And what that means is that
communication and organization

00:58:27.660 --> 00:58:31.380
become a more important
skill in order

00:58:31.380 --> 00:58:34.290
to bind all these
things together.

00:58:34.290 --> 00:58:36.060
That was like one
random thought I had,

00:58:36.060 --> 00:58:37.710
if you guys had sort of
thought about the problem

00:58:37.710 --> 00:58:38.710
from that point of view.

00:58:38.710 --> 00:58:42.720
And then, the other was
that you guys have clearly

00:58:42.720 --> 00:58:44.880
put a lot of
thinking into funding

00:58:44.880 --> 00:58:49.470
at a government, like country
or even institutional level.

00:58:49.470 --> 00:58:51.990
But there's also an
individual level of funding

00:58:51.990 --> 00:58:54.540
that has to happen, where
I have to decide to go

00:58:54.540 --> 00:58:56.370
get a particular degree or not.

00:58:56.370 --> 00:58:59.940
And I decide, even within
that degree, what happens.

00:58:59.940 --> 00:59:03.270
And so this other point
about specialization

00:59:03.270 --> 00:59:06.399
is the more specialized
things become,

00:59:06.399 --> 00:59:08.190
some of those things,
some of those choices

00:59:08.190 --> 00:59:12.060
to become specialized
require very advanced funding

00:59:12.060 --> 00:59:13.740
on the part of the individual.

00:59:13.740 --> 00:59:16.920
And to the extent that
our economy is maximized

00:59:16.920 --> 00:59:20.250
by reconfiguring
all these jobs, that

00:59:20.250 --> 00:59:22.770
can be a total bummer
if you guess wrong

00:59:22.770 --> 00:59:26.930
or it can be a lottery
ticket if you guess right.

00:59:26.930 --> 00:59:29.430
And then, the other point is--

00:59:29.430 --> 00:59:31.764
back to the one that you
made with technology,

00:59:31.764 --> 00:59:33.930
is that the other force
that technology can do is it

00:59:33.930 --> 00:59:37.320
can actually reduce the training
required to accomplish a job.

00:59:37.320 --> 00:59:38.820
And that actually
means the job pays

00:59:38.820 --> 00:59:41.550
less than it did before my
individual investment was

00:59:41.550 --> 00:59:42.150
lower.

00:59:42.150 --> 00:59:44.790
So I'm wondering if you
guys see trends in--

00:59:44.790 --> 00:59:48.210
or I don't know,
solutions in the sort

00:59:48.210 --> 00:59:52.105
of level of individuals
making these investments.

00:59:52.105 --> 00:59:54.480
And whether those things are
going in the right direction

00:59:54.480 --> 00:59:55.350
or not?

00:59:55.350 --> 00:59:56.700
So like I said, this
wasn't a good question.

00:59:56.700 --> 00:59:57.574
I admit that upfront.

00:59:57.574 --> 01:00:00.000
But some thoughts that
you guys [INAUDIBLE]..

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:01.020
STIAN WESTLAKE: Yeah.

01:00:01.020 --> 01:00:02.436
I think that's
really interesting.

01:00:02.436 --> 01:00:03.480
I mean, I think we've--

01:00:03.480 --> 01:00:06.030
on that second
question about, well,

01:00:06.030 --> 01:00:09.630
what's an individual to do
in terms of their own skills

01:00:09.630 --> 01:00:13.356
and training in
this new economy?

01:00:13.356 --> 01:00:15.855
I think the first thing, this
question about how specialized

01:00:15.855 --> 01:00:17.540
do you need to be?

01:00:17.540 --> 01:00:20.510
On the one hand, clearly the
demands of new technology

01:00:20.510 --> 01:00:23.180
do increase the premium to
certain highly-specialized

01:00:23.180 --> 01:00:24.710
skills.

01:00:24.710 --> 01:00:26.480
Everyone is hiring
data scientists.

01:00:26.480 --> 01:00:30.500
So next year, it'll be
something else and so forth.

01:00:30.500 --> 01:00:32.450
The flip-side is--
and it comes back

01:00:32.450 --> 01:00:34.550
to these properties of
intangibles, particularly

01:00:34.550 --> 01:00:36.620
the spillovers
and the synergies.

01:00:36.620 --> 01:00:39.230
We know that one thing that
will be really rewarded

01:00:39.230 --> 01:00:41.330
in an intangible
economy is the ability

01:00:41.330 --> 01:00:43.160
to bring together
different intangibles

01:00:43.160 --> 01:00:45.010
and kind of coordinate them.

01:00:45.010 --> 01:00:49.179
And that suggests that not so
much technical specialization,

01:00:49.179 --> 01:00:51.220
but actually a lot of
quite old-fashioned skills,

01:00:51.220 --> 01:00:55.090
like social skills, leadership,
and perhaps a combination

01:00:55.090 --> 01:00:57.490
of a sufficient level
of technical expertise

01:00:57.490 --> 01:01:00.130
plus an ability to be
kind of an integrator,

01:01:00.130 --> 01:01:02.504
might be really valuable.

01:01:02.504 --> 01:01:04.420
In my days when I was a
management consultant,

01:01:04.420 --> 01:01:06.725
I had this awful phrase
called "spiky integrators."

01:01:06.725 --> 01:01:08.350
I don't know if that's
a general thing.

01:01:08.350 --> 01:01:10.330
But it'd be someone who's
got a spike in one area,

01:01:10.330 --> 01:01:11.890
but enough competence
in other areas

01:01:11.890 --> 01:01:13.482
to integrate different skills.

01:01:13.482 --> 01:01:15.940
And it may be that in an economy
of more synergies and more

01:01:15.940 --> 01:01:19.480
spillovers, those skills
are particularly valued.

01:01:19.480 --> 01:01:21.760
I know in my old
work, we did a lot

01:01:21.760 --> 01:01:23.830
of research asking
hiring companies

01:01:23.830 --> 01:01:26.350
about the skills they were
looking for in data scientists.

01:01:26.350 --> 01:01:28.162
And that was the
kind of sweet spot.

01:01:28.162 --> 01:01:30.370
It was, we want people who
are enough of a quant jock

01:01:30.370 --> 01:01:33.430
to understand what's going on,
but they also need to be able--

01:01:33.430 --> 01:01:35.350
and then, the company
would reel off

01:01:35.350 --> 01:01:36.970
five different
things they needed

01:01:36.970 --> 01:01:40.060
to understand related to their
own particular business model.

01:01:40.060 --> 01:01:42.130
Now, in some ways,
that's quite good news

01:01:42.130 --> 01:01:45.680
for our kind of hypothetical,
perplexed young person

01:01:45.680 --> 01:01:46.180
setting out.

01:01:46.180 --> 01:01:48.980
Because it means that there are
some more transferable skills

01:01:48.980 --> 01:01:50.790
that are worth developing.

01:01:50.790 --> 01:01:53.050
Often, quite soft skills.

01:01:53.050 --> 01:01:55.870
But then, I kind of do
agree with your more--

01:01:55.870 --> 01:01:59.990
the more concerned part
of what you're saying.

01:01:59.990 --> 01:02:01.930
Because if we are
expecting people

01:02:01.930 --> 01:02:04.450
to invest more in their
skills, this uncertainty

01:02:04.450 --> 01:02:07.460
still applies because some of
these skills will be specific.

01:02:07.460 --> 01:02:09.501
And I guess there, this
is the question of, well,

01:02:09.501 --> 01:02:11.890
how do you genuinely
generate lifelong learning

01:02:11.890 --> 01:02:12.880
in an economy?

01:02:12.880 --> 01:02:14.980
Well, most world
economies, learning

01:02:14.980 --> 01:02:18.790
stops at 18, or 21, or 25.

01:02:18.790 --> 01:02:21.675
I think that's partly a
technological question

01:02:21.675 --> 01:02:25.355
and partly a social question.

01:02:25.355 --> 01:02:27.480
JONATHAN HASKEL: Can I try
a very quick reflection?

01:02:27.480 --> 01:02:28.390
Would it be all right?

01:02:28.390 --> 01:02:29.040
SPEAKER 1: Sure.

01:02:29.040 --> 01:02:30.873
JONATHAN HASKEL: Just
on your nice question,

01:02:30.873 --> 01:02:32.740
as a card-carrying
economist, I think

01:02:32.740 --> 01:02:34.570
you asked a very
profound question, which

01:02:34.570 --> 01:02:37.660
is, if you think about
societies before they

01:02:37.660 --> 01:02:39.280
were very specialized.

01:02:39.280 --> 01:02:42.490
You know, the farmer
would know the farm worker

01:02:42.490 --> 01:02:43.180
and they would--

01:02:43.180 --> 01:02:45.035
you do me a favor,
and you a favor,

01:02:45.035 --> 01:02:46.160
and all that kind of thing.

01:02:46.160 --> 01:02:48.500
But once you get a very
specialized economy,

01:02:48.500 --> 01:02:51.411
and the distance between
people goes apart,

01:02:51.411 --> 01:02:53.410
there isn't so now I'm
going to be an economist.

01:02:53.410 --> 01:02:55.420
There's just a shortage of love.

01:02:55.420 --> 01:02:57.190
That's the problem.

01:02:57.190 --> 01:02:59.380
There's just not enough
love to go around.

01:02:59.380 --> 01:03:02.230
And so we have to have
in society some way

01:03:02.230 --> 01:03:03.100
to replace that.

01:03:03.100 --> 01:03:04.930
And it's called
the price system.

01:03:04.930 --> 01:03:07.210
And the miracle of
economics is that

01:03:07.210 --> 01:03:09.730
this incredible
decentralized economy where

01:03:09.730 --> 01:03:12.287
people don't know each
other is coordinated

01:03:12.287 --> 01:03:13.120
by the price system.

01:03:13.120 --> 01:03:15.250
So the shoes you're wearing,
you don't know the person

01:03:15.250 --> 01:03:16.030
who's built the shoes.

01:03:16.030 --> 01:03:18.550
Hundreds of years ago, you
would know who's made the shoes.

01:03:18.550 --> 01:03:19.750
But you don't know that now.

01:03:19.750 --> 01:03:21.970
Now, of course, in the
intangible economy,

01:03:21.970 --> 01:03:25.089
for the types of reasons
we've talked about,

01:03:25.089 --> 01:03:27.130
maybe the price system
just doesn't work so well.

01:03:27.130 --> 01:03:28.838
So we don't quite know
what the ownership

01:03:28.838 --> 01:03:29.854
is, as Stian was saying.

01:03:29.854 --> 01:03:32.270
We don't quite know about the
spillovers, and all of that.

01:03:32.270 --> 01:03:36.084
So I think we need to possibly
reinvent all of that stuff,

01:03:36.084 --> 01:03:37.750
because we may not
have the right system

01:03:37.750 --> 01:03:40.789
to deal with it at the moment.

01:03:40.789 --> 01:03:42.080
SPEAKER 1: Thank you, Jonathan.

01:03:42.080 --> 01:03:42.790
Stian.

01:03:42.790 --> 01:03:44.260
Thank you, everyone, for coming.

01:03:44.260 --> 01:03:45.385
JONATHAN HASKEL: Thank you.

01:03:45.385 --> 01:03:47.610
