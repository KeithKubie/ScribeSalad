00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.690
Let's try to find the sum
of this right over here,

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:07.360
or let's try to evaluate this
expression right over here.

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:11.874
So we're evaluating what
this sum turns out to be.

00:00:11.874 --> 00:00:13.540
Now, there's a bunch
of ways to do this.

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:15.150
You could literally just
do it by brute force.

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:16.858
You could say, well,
what does this equal

00:00:16.858 --> 00:00:20.580
when n equals 1, when n equals
2, all the way to n equals 7?

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.670
And that would be
completely legitimate.

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:24.250
But I view this
is an opportunity

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:28.130
to look at some properties
of sigma notation.

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:29.319
So let's split this out.

00:00:29.319 --> 00:00:30.860
So the first thing
that you might say

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:32.790
is, well, look, if
I were to sum up

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.570
all of these when n equals 1
and n equals 2, all the way to n

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:39.740
equals 7, it's reasonable
that this is going

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:46.660
to be the same thing as the
sum of 3 n squared from n

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:55.460
equals 1 to 7 plus the
sum from n equals 1 to 7

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.940
of 2n squared-- of
2n, I should say,

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:06.690
that right over there, plus the
sum from n equals 1 to 7 of 4.

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:09.490
And if you find this a
little bit confusing,

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:11.970
I encourage you to expand
to both of these things

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.640
out and realize that when
you rearrange the terms,

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.340
that you will get
these two things.

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.080
I'm not doing a
rigorous proof here,

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:19.996
but hopefully, if you
were to expand this out,

00:01:19.996 --> 00:01:22.210
you'd see that this is
not an unreasonable thing

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:24.390
to claim right over here.

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.040
Now, out of all of
these, this last piece

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:28.950
is pretty easy to evaluate.

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.330
When n equals 1, this
thing is equal to 4.

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:33.420
When n equals 2, this
thing is equal to 4.

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.730
When n equals 3, this
thing is equal to 4.

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:39.800
So you're essentially going
to take seven 4's and add them

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:40.390
together.

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:43.460
So this is essentially just
going to evaluate to 7 times

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.730
4, or 28.

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:49.090
Now let's look at this
piece right over here.

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:51.880
Now, once again, we can
just do it by brute force.

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.300
2 times 1 is 2 plus
2 times 2 is 4.

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:57.380
So you're going to
essentially do the first seven

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.660
multiples of 2 is one way
you could think about this.

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:03.075
Or, if we were to expand
it out-- actually,

00:02:03.075 --> 00:02:03.950
let me expand it out.

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:12.870
This is going to be 2 plus
4 plus 6, all the way to,

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.530
when this is 7,
all the way to 14.

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.180
You could factor out a 2.

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.360
And so this is going to
become 2 times 1 plus 2

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.040
plus 3 all the way to 7.

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.980
And so you can rewrite
this piece right over

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:30.230
here as 2 times the sum--
so we're essentially just

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:33.660
factoring out the 2--
2 times the sum, which

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:37.650
is the sum from n
equals 1 to 7 of n.

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.440
So this is this piece.

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.290
We still have this 28
that we have to add.

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:43.120
So we have this 28.

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:44.640
And we draw the
parentheses so you

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.760
don't think that the 28 is
part of this right over here.

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.110
And now we can do the
same thing with this.

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:54.220
3 times n-- we're taking from
n equals 1 to 7 of 3 n squared.

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:57.310
Doing the same exact thing
as we just did in magenta,

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:03.710
this is going to be equal
to 3 times the sum from n

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:07.390
equals 1 to 7 of n squared.

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:09.200
We're essentially
factoring out the 3.

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.990
We're factoring out the 2.

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:13.070
n squared.

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:14.940
And once again, we can
put parentheses just

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:16.630
to clarify things.

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:21.390
Now, at this point, there
are formulas to evaluate

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:22.570
each of these things.

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:25.410
There's a formula to evaluate
this thing right over here.

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:27.679
There's a formula to evaluate
this thing over here.

00:03:27.679 --> 00:03:28.720
And you can look them up.

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.640
And actually, I'll
give you the formulas,

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:32.350
in case you're curious.

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:35.340
This formula, one
expression of this formula

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:39.790
is that this is going to
be n to the third over 3

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:45.000
plus n squared over
2 plus n over 6.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.610
That's one formula for that.

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:49.410
And one formula for this piece
right over here, going from n

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:52.190
equals 1 to 7-- sorry.

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:53.390
Let me make it clear.

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:59.040
This n is actually what your
terminal value should be.

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.850
So this should be 7 to
the third power over 3--

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:04.250
so it's not this n.

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:08.720
I was just mindlessly using the
formula-- 7 to the third over 3

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:13.890
plus 7 squared over 2 plus 7/6.

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:15.610
So that's this sum.

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:17.790
And this sum, you could
view it as the average

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:19.240
of the first and the last terms.

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:20.610
So the first term is 1.

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:22.550
The last term is 7.

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:24.770
So take their average
and then multiply it

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:26.990
times the number
of terms you have.

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:31.360
So times-- you have 7 terms.

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:34.240
So what is this middle
one going to evaluate to?

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:38.430
Well, 1 times-- and of course,
we have this 2 out front.

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:40.360
This green is just this
part right over here.

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.180
So you have 2 times this.

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:47.930
And over here, you have 3 times
this business right over here.

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:51.180
So if we evaluate this
one, 2 times-- let's see.

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:53.700
1 plus 7 is 8,
divided by 2 is 4.

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:55.300
4 times 2 is 8.

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:57.320
Times 7, it's 56.

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:59.930
So that becomes 56.

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:01.390
Now, this-- let's see.

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:04.600
This is actually-- well, we
could evaluate this if we want.

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:06.480
And I guess we could
take out a calculator

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:08.479
if we wanted to figure
out 7 to the third power.

00:05:08.479 --> 00:05:11.620
Actually, let's just do
that just to save time here.

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:13.460
So let's calculate.

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:18.010
So we have 7 to the
third power divided by 3

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:24.910
plus 7 squared divided
by 2 plus 7 divided by 6

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:28.470
gives us a drum roll of 140.

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:33.180
So this is going to
be equal to 3 times

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:42.330
140-- let me do it in that
color-- 3 times 140 plus 56

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:44.840
plus 28.

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:47.889
And since we get our calculator
out, let's just use it.

00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:48.430
So let's see.

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:57.770
140 times 3 is 420,
of course, plus 56,

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:05.580
plus 28-- we deserve a drum
roll now-- gets us to 504.

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:11.112
So this sum right over
here is equal to 504.

00:06:11.112 --> 00:06:13.330
And once again, multiple
ways you can do it.

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:16.450
But it's nice to know
that there are these ways

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:18.046
to break down the problem.

00:06:18.046 --> 00:06:19.420
And there are all
these formulas.

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:23.340
Now, I encourage you
to look at the formulas

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:25.699
to see how this is actually
derived and proved.

00:06:25.699 --> 00:06:27.240
I'm not a big fan
of just saying, oh,

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:28.364
there's a formula for this.

00:06:28.364 --> 00:06:29.380
You just apply it.

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:32.000
The formula here is
whatever this terminal value

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.400
is to the third power over
3 plus that squared over 2,

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:36.760
plus that over 6.

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:40.740
I encourage you to
look up on our site,

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:44.350
on Khan Academy, the formula
for the sum of n squares,

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:46.380
and it'll tell you where
this is derived from.

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:49.540
And also, the formula for the
sum of an arithmetic series,

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:53.620
and it'll tell you where
this is derived from.
