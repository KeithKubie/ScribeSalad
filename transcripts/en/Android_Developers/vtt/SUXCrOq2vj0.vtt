ILANA BENISH: My name is Ilana
Benish, and I am 38 years old.

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:08.100
I was born blind.

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:13.200
I had many surgeries,
and they have succeeded

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.150
to improve my sight in one eye.

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.260
Independency means access.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.900
Many of the technologies
that are available today

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.412
are not accessible.

00:00:27.412 --> 00:00:31.214
And that's why I
came to APPlicable.

00:00:31.214 --> 00:00:32.630
MICHAL WALTNER:
My name is Michal.

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:35.290
I'm the program manager
of Campus Tel Aviv, which

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:38.700
is a Google space that is
dedicated to entrepreneurs

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.880
and startups, meaning
helping the local ecosystem

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:43.890
to create amazing startups.

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.440
I started thinking, how is it
possible that this huge market

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.240
is not being addressed?

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:54.540
Because if they knew that,
with some easy steps,

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:59.790
they can actually make their app
accessible to this huge market,

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:03.370
I was sure that they'd bound
to do something about this.

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:06.520
So this is how the idea of this
problem of APPlicable started.

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.020
ARIEL KEDEM: My
name is Ariel Kedem.

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.400
I'm a mobile product
manager at Fiverr.

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.250
Fiverr is a marketplace
for creative professionals.

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.970
We are helping people
productize and make money

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.560
from their talent.

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.001
Fiverr is trying to
change how people work,

00:01:23.001 --> 00:01:25.680
and allowing people
with disabilities

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.209
to work with Fiverr
is something big.

00:01:28.209 --> 00:01:30.000
MICHAL WALTNER: So we
started with visually

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.300
impaired and blind people.

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:33.990
Each table had a startup.

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.560
Mentors from the design
world, from the product world,

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.740
and developers sat
together with a person

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.070
with a visual
impairment and a person

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:47.731
who's blind to see how he's
actually using his own app.

00:01:47.731 --> 00:01:49.980
JONATHAN LEVIN: My name is
Jonathan, Android developer

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:51.356
and evangelist in Gett.

00:01:51.356 --> 00:01:54.590
Gett is a leading platform
from on-demand services,

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.292
like Gett Taxi or Gett
Pizza, or even Gett Doctor.

00:01:58.292 --> 00:02:00.750
I remember at the beginning
there was a woman who said, ah,

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:01.380
you're from Gett?

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:02.421
I'm not talking with you.

00:02:02.421 --> 00:02:03.882
Like, you make my life awful.

00:02:03.882 --> 00:02:06.090
When you make this difference
for them, first of all,

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.115
you feel proud because
you really helped someone.

00:02:09.115 --> 00:02:10.740
One of the really
small changes that we

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:14.940
did that has huge impact was
that, when you open the app,

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.150
you have marketing pop-up
right straight on the screen.

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.430
And it doesn't have any label.

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.720
So for the blind people,
it was like, oh, we're

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.855
showing a regular map with an
address and an "Order a Taxi"

00:02:27.855 --> 00:02:28.355
button.

00:02:28.355 --> 00:02:31.170
And wasn't aware that they
actually had that marketing

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.610
pop-up, and they can't click on
anything or using the TalkBack.

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:40.230
And by just verifying that,
if the TalkBack is turned off,

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.500
not to show this pop-up
is, like, huge difference,

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.430
because now these people are
able to order the taxi instead

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.440
of constantly clicking
on the marketing pop-up

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.840
and not understanding why
you can't order a taxi.

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.330
Actually, the impact was that
she went out of the building

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:56.090
and she said, oh, now I
am able to order the taxi.

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:59.040
ARIEL KEDEM: We actually did
some really small change.

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.630
We have a page of
categories within Fiverr.

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:07.210
It was built, like, [INAUDIBLE]
category next to category

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:09.510
in a very long page.

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.870
And when we did
one of the session,

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:16.830
they just tell me, just build
them one in a row, and not one

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:18.120
next to each other.

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.960
So we changed it, we put
it in the app homepage,

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:24.580
and just changed dramatically
how people navigate the app.

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:26.740
Thinking about a
simple experience

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:28.930
just made me a better
product manager.

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:31.770
JONATHAN LEVIN: With a
really small effort, just

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:33.810
to change a little
bit bytes of code,

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:35.310
to add the additional
stuff, and you

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.550
can make really huge
difference for them,

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:39.750
for their daily routine.

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:44.690
ARIEL KEDEM: Tagging your
components on a specific page.

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:50.850
Giving an image
the right ALT tag.

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:55.320
It's really something that,
when you change how you think,

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:57.080
it's very simple.

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:01.100
Enable the accessible
view on your phone,

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:06.980
try to use the phone as someone,
just for example, can't see.

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:10.702
This will affect everything
you do dramatically.

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:16.422
- Button 96 unlabeled.

00:04:16.422 --> 00:04:19.645
Button 13 unlabeled.

00:04:19.645 --> 00:04:22.000
Button 74 unlabeled.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:22.856
Button.

00:04:22.856 --> 00:04:24.830
Button 18 unlabeled.

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:26.630
Button 35 unlabeled.

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:27.130
Button.

00:04:29.755 --> 00:04:33.683
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:04:34.665 --> 00:04:36.630
- How was it?

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:38.390
- Disaster.

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:39.210
Really a disaster.

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:41.670
MICHAL WALTNER: So
after about half a year

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:45.700
that we dealt with visual
impairment and blindness,

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:48.270
we went to the second
stage of the program

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:52.200
and addressed people
with motor disabilities.

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:54.760
So again, we opened
testing labs.

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:56.610
We brought the mentors,
we brought people

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:59.040
with disabilities,
we brought startups.

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:01.710
And we realized that
this is definitely

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:04.150
something that is so needed.

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:08.082
OHAD YIFRAH: Take your phone
in one hand, and start to run.

00:05:08.082 --> 00:05:15.150
Run and try to send
message during the running.

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:18.240
You will have a lot
of mistakes, and you

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:22.030
need to erase and
retype, erase and retype.

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:27.322
And this is my life
when I'm using apps.

00:05:27.322 --> 00:05:28.786
I am Ohad.

00:05:28.786 --> 00:05:30.900
I am 39 years old.

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:36.840
I'm working in Gett as
a Senior QA Engineer.

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:40.030
I have cerebral palsy.

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:44.870
And the effect of that,
you can see my speech

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:48.900
is very-- I have a
difficult speech.

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:51.952
And my right hand
is not functional,

00:05:51.952 --> 00:05:56.750
and also both two legs
are not functional.

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:59.220
And I have only one hand.

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:05.640
And even in that hand, in
three fingers I have a spastic.

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:10.900
It's very difficult to touch,
to reach all the corners

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:13.330
with one finger.

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:16.890
My wildest dream is that
I will have the ability

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:21.092
to put every each button
in the place that I want.

00:06:21.092 --> 00:06:27.110
I know that the designers and
UI and UX wouldn't love that,

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:31.300
but it will make
the app park more

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:35.880
accessible for me, and for
the many, many other people.

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:37.640
This is my dream.

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:41.060
ILANA BENISH: To meet with
them to tell them our needs,

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:44.470
it was very, very
important meetings.

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:46.900
JONATHAN LEVIN: My
message to all developers

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:48.960
will be, hey, guys,
you are there.

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:51.430
You actually are
the one that can

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:56.260
have the power to change,
for a lot of people,

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:57.507
their entire life.

00:06:57.507 --> 00:06:59.590
ARIEL KEDEM: I think about
this amazing APPlicable

00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:02.330
session in every
screen, page, or button

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:05.530
that I am adding to the app.

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:09.790
OHAD YIFRAH: To make the app
more accessible, it's a must.

00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:12.690
So now, the ball
is in your hands.

00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:17.380
ILANA BENISH: Accessible
apps are changing our lives

00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:21.610
every day, and will
continue to change

00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:24.580
everybody's life, every day.

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:28.230
