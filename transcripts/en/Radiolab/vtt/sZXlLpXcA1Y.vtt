1
00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:02.100
I'm Molly Webster.

2
00:00:02.101 --> 00:00:06.990
This is gonads episode five this week we're bringing you a pair of episodes.

3
00:00:06.991 --> 00:00:09.480
This is the second one in the pear. Um,

4
00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.160
they grew out of our reporting on x's and y's and all the different biological

5
00:00:14.161 --> 00:00:18.030
realities that live inside of us in this episode.

6
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.670
They're calling them Dana's em. Hello? Hello? Hello? Hi. I can hear you.

7
00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:27.210
Hi, this is Molly Webster. I can hear you. I got one of your working.

8
00:00:27.211 --> 00:00:31.140
The other one's pretty low, but do you want to just turn the headphones around?

9
00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:35.970
How is that working for you? Dana is doing something kind of historic,

10
00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:39.810
I guess you could say. Oh, I can move and just to start us off.

11
00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.100
Dana uses the pronoun they, not him or her, but they,

12
00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.780
and a few years ago, 2015 or 14, I can't remember which,

13
00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:50.100
I have memory issues.

14
00:00:50.101 --> 00:00:55.101
So it's around 2014 Dana is filling out a passport application and there are two

15
00:00:56.161 --> 00:01:00.150
boxes to check male or female. And Dana's like, well,

16
00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.620
I'm not either one of those.

17
00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:05.660
And so they wrote in a third option intersects

18
00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.850
<v 1>right. My basically apply for my passport.</v>

19
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.960
Got talked to by the manager on the office.

20
00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:15.990
It took me no side and said, you know, you cannot,

21
00:01:15.991 --> 00:01:19.590
you get this passport and they turned me down and I

22
00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:24.530
<v 0>peeled and way you can appeal a passport application. Yeah too.</v>

23
00:01:24.531 --> 00:01:29.480
Who Do you go back to the passport office and say hi appeal. Yeah,

24
00:01:29.481 --> 00:01:31.100
I totally get where they backed in the past.

25
00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.310
<v 1>What office and you know and I appealed</v>

26
00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:40.490
<v 0>but the passport office rejected the appeal basically saying male or female.</v>

27
00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.180
That's all we got. Yeah. From there I found legal counsel.

28
00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:49.750
So Dana ends up suing the State Department for a third non female non male

29
00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:51.733
option.

30
00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:56.720
So we brought Dana into the studio to talk about the State Department case and

31
00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.330
while we were having our conversation,

32
00:01:59.331 --> 00:02:04.331
what began to unfold like in their personal life story was this tale of words.

33
00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.110
How words have the power to shape the world.

34
00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:12.150
<v 2>Oh boy.</v>

35
00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.810
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

36
00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:16.730
<v 2>oh</v>

37
00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:19.463
<v 3>[inaudible].</v>

38
00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.670
<v 0>I was an air force Brat so we moved all over the place.</v>

39
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.470
Dana was born in 1958 Michigan. Who was in the military?

40
00:02:27.471 --> 00:02:31.730
Your Dad or your mom? My Dad for you was like queer or force pilot.

41
00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:35.850
So it was in Alabama for awhile. Texas for a while.

42
00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:40.540
Ma Montana for awhile. England for a while as a kid and I was a kid,

43
00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.600
grew up with a bunch of brothers who were brothers and one younger,

44
00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:48.170
like a whole pack of boys approximately 18 months apart.

45
00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:50.960
But Dana never really felt like one of them.

46
00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:52.670
<v 1>I got teased a lot</v>

47
00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:59.230
when I started showering with other boys and probably like the grade started

48
00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:02.320
getting teased

49
00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.330
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

50
00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:09.330
<v 5>about why size and looking physically different down here.</v>

51
00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:10.970
Uh,

52
00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:15.970
cause my testicles didn't look like the other boys with it looked like a stuffed

53
00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:18.190
sassy.

54
00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:23.190
It was little didn't look right and Dana said it never felt right either.

55
00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:28.950
Well it's always having pain p oof from when you were little.

56
00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:31.830
Yeah. You know, going to the bathroom and those kinds of things.

57
00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:37.050
Everything hurt. Not only that, but it was a close,

58
00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:38.700
smaller, you know,

59
00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:43.600
I throw a ball like a girl on the brothers tried to help Olin roller.

60
00:03:43.601 --> 00:03:48.000
I was always trying to teach me how to do things better. G was my hair over.

61
00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:52.290
Try to stick up for me, but to me the world was a scary place.

62
00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:56.660
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

63
00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:01.090
<v 6>uh, my dad was always gone flying and he was kind of a scary figure.</v>

64
00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:03.250
My mother,

65
00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:07.600
she had a backhand that wouldn't quit and she never played tennis.

66
00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:09.671
<v 5>And Dana says,</v>

67
00:04:09.671 --> 00:04:14.590
for some reason their parents always kept a close watch on them. Like,

68
00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:17.020
remember once in Childhood Hood?

69
00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:18.160
<v 1>Uh,</v>

70
00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:23.160
we were living in Arkansas and the girl next door had nose cut out Barbie Ball,

71
00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:28.450
the hall close. And you know, we're, he had cardboard, barbies.

72
00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:31.390
She has those and we're playing with ours.

73
00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:35.530
She and I and my dad caught us. Hmm.

74
00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:41.190
I got my, my butt spite. And boys don't play with dolls. Hmm.

75
00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:46.150
My brothers were able to do things similar to the hat,

76
00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:47.530
but I wasn't allowed to.

77
00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:48.051
<v 0>Oh,</v>

78
00:04:48.051 --> 00:04:52.340
so you think like if your brother was playing the paper dolls with the neighbor,

79
00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:56.840
it would've been a different response. Did you have any idea? Like why?

80
00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:02.060
<v 1>Nope, I knew something was different. I just had no words.</v>

81
00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:05.030
My world was very small

82
00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:09.360
<v 0>and I think you could say it was partially because of that smallness in an</v>

83
00:05:09.361 --> 00:05:12.150
effort to make the world like a little bit bigger.

84
00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:16.560
In 1978 at 20 [inaudible] I joined the Navy

85
00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:21.073
<v 4>[inaudible] you did.</v>

86
00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:25.050
<v 0>That's so interesting because I would think that you would run away from the</v>

87
00:05:25.051 --> 00:05:29.410
military after your dad was in year four instead of one of the decisions,

88
00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:31.710
but Oh, you went off of it.

89
00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:36.970
<v 4>Yeah. [inaudible]</v>

90
00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:42.760
<v 7>to some 60 Americans are now beginning the sixth day of captivity,</v>

91
00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:48.460
improve their golf and then a small group of islands of the age of Antarctica,

92
00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:52.540
Antarctic islands. And then I did three tours.

93
00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:55.030
Every yard story exchanges, brocade,

94
00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:58.400
<v 0>they route hours. How did it feel to be,</v>

95
00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:02.210
to be part of the military or at least away from home and away from your

96
00:06:02.211 --> 00:06:03.650
siblings and your parents?

97
00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:07.480
<v 1>Uh, it felt fairly good. I felt a little free,</v>

98
00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:13.720
free, a free to the confines and, well,

99
00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:18.040
a couple things happened when I was in the navy about five years in.

100
00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:21.040
First people started thinking I was gay.

101
00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:26.350
Not that I did anything to encourage that. I didn't date anybody.

102
00:06:26.351 --> 00:06:30.280
I didn't do anything. Or do you remember how that started or why? Well,

103
00:06:30.281 --> 00:06:32.560
because I was so small,

104
00:06:32.561 --> 00:06:37.000
I didn't go out drinking and trying to pick up women with the guys.

105
00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:40.450
And there was somebody on board,

106
00:06:40.451 --> 00:06:45.451
my first ship who I guess was putting books and magazines on my rack,

107
00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:51.460
very gay context, gay porn or something explicit gay porn.

108
00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:53.560
And some books

109
00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:58.580
<v 0>you could think that leaving gay porn on someone's bed or bookshelf is not that</v>

110
00:06:58.581 --> 00:07:02.420
big of a deal or it's some sort of like initiation thing or something. Um,

111
00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:03.740
but this was at a time

112
00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:08.690
<v 1>before, don't ask, don't tell where if you were gay, you were kicked out.</v>

113
00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:13.490
And so I got caught up in witch hunts,

114
00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:16.220
you know, at one point the NIS,

115
00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:21.290
which is a precursors to the MCIS, the National Institute of Security,

116
00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:23.200
Navy intelligence.

117
00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:27.920
<v 0>Oh, okay. So called, give me another acronym on nail it.</v>

118
00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:33.310
<v 1>Anyway, uh, so they infuriated me about, you know,</v>

119
00:07:33.311 --> 00:07:38.020
who I was dating, who I had sex with. Yeah. You know,

120
00:07:38.021 --> 00:07:39.160
those kinds of things.

121
00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:43.930
And then while all that was happening when I was in Beirut on my second tour,

122
00:07:43.931 --> 00:07:46.870
late fall 1982,

123
00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:51.950
<v 0>Dana was working below deck doing some paperwork in a noisy fan room and an</v>

124
00:07:52.061 --> 00:07:55.560
announcement when out on the ship that said that they're going to do a test

125
00:07:55.561 --> 00:07:58.410
launch of one of the gigantic missiles on board.

126
00:07:58.830 --> 00:08:02.130
But Dana didn't hear the announcement because they were in the super loud room.

127
00:08:02.250 --> 00:08:04.860
<v 1>And then I get done my paperwork.</v>

128
00:08:05.490 --> 00:08:09.060
I opened the hatch to go back into the ship.

129
00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:14.330
I step out the gun goes off firing a 70 pound projectile maybe 20,

130
00:08:17.371 --> 00:08:20.580
30 feet away from my head. Holy Crap. Yeah.

131
00:08:21.090 --> 00:08:24.520
And um, yeah.

132
00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:28.630
And the Carmen basically white blood on my years gave me some aspirin and said,

133
00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:33.240
you get your balance back and go back to work. Basically. Back in those days,

134
00:08:33.241 --> 00:08:34.074
they didn't know about,

135
00:08:34.110 --> 00:08:38.460
really weren't too concerned about brain injuries or anything yet. It's like,

136
00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:40.680
hey, you just go back to work. You're fine. You know,

137
00:08:40.710 --> 00:08:44.040
they didn't really realize how much screwed up you can be from them.

138
00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:46.640
Dana says it. Ever since that time. I can't,

139
00:08:46.770 --> 00:08:51.030
I have a hard time looking backwards and telling time.

140
00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:55.830
<v 0>Needless to say, after the witch hunts and the brain injury a</v>

141
00:08:56.200 --> 00:09:01.110
<v 1>re up when I'm like, no, you know what?</v>

142
00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:05.010
When I got out, you know, four years after I got out, I think it was,

143
00:09:05.011 --> 00:09:09.720
or a little bit longer, I started going to Colorado State University.

144
00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:14.010
I was about 30 years old when I started college.

145
00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:15.830
<v 0>During their first semester,</v>

146
00:09:15.831 --> 00:09:20.831
Dana was in a poetry class and Dana says something in the words of those poets

147
00:09:21.501 --> 00:09:26.210
and in the class discussion, push them to go see the college therapist.

148
00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:28.730
<v 1>I walked in and said, well, you know, I, I'm,</v>

149
00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:31.520
I think I'm depressed and I'm thinking I'm gay,

150
00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:37.300
<v 4>gay. [inaudible]</v>

151
00:09:39.450 --> 00:09:42.750
<v 1>tell me more about the, why you thought you were gay. Well, um,</v>

152
00:09:44.540 --> 00:09:46.100
two things. Um,

153
00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:50.500
all that confusion going on in my mind that, you know,

154
00:09:51.010 --> 00:09:52.920
am I a boy or girl kind of things.

155
00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.170
I don't really know what the hell is going on with me anyway.

156
00:09:56.640 --> 00:10:00.360
<v 0>Dana says that he didn't really feel like a boy, like the way other boys do.</v>

157
00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:04.800
They kind of felt like an off kilter kind of boy and what do you call that?

158
00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:10.000
<v 1>And then all these witch hunts in the navy got really thorough thinking about,</v>

159
00:10:13.850 --> 00:10:15.140
uh, whether I was or not.

160
00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:19.340
<v 0>Like maybe those guys were seeing something that Dana couldn't see it.</v>

161
00:10:19.341 --> 00:10:20.420
That that was true.

162
00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:25.020
<v 1>I thought, well I must be a gay man cause I didn't know anything else.</v>

163
00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:29.070
I didn't know how any other term we had gay, lesbian,

164
00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:33.070
bisexual and we had crossdressers. Oh yeah.

165
00:10:33.310 --> 00:10:35.770
<v 0>When you say you're like, okay, out of those options,</v>

166
00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:38.260
which one feels the most like me?

167
00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:42.970
<v 1>Tyler was the one I thought was the best option that I was.</v>

168
00:10:42.971 --> 00:10:46.750
So I went the gay male and you know,

169
00:10:46.751 --> 00:10:51.751
I didn't date anybody but the therapist that Dana saw ended up recommending that

170
00:10:51.761 --> 00:10:56.260
they go join this group on campus. It was the gay lesbian alliance,

171
00:10:56.680 --> 00:11:00.100
which later became the gay, lesbian and bisexual alliance. You know,

172
00:11:00.310 --> 00:11:05.140
because that's how long ago it was. This would have been 1989 ish. Yeah.

173
00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:09.210
<v 0>Walking into that group. What is that? Here I am.</v>

174
00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:11.700
What did it feel like t two here you are.

175
00:11:12.450 --> 00:11:16.260
<v 1>Was pounding like, man, you know,</v>

176
00:11:16.261 --> 00:11:20.250
I didn't know what to expect. And they just said, oh welcome, have a seat.

177
00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:23.610
You didn't ask how are you dating or your fuck or anything like that.

178
00:11:23.830 --> 00:11:27.550
<v 0>Those would be some hard first question I think I'd run if someone started a</v>

179
00:11:27.551 --> 00:11:30.910
conversation with that fossil went through my mind is like, you know,

180
00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:35.230
you thought there was like an entry visa where you had to like sign off on

181
00:11:35.231 --> 00:11:36.970
certain things? Yeah, yeah.

182
00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:41.090
<v 1>But they were very welcoming and I thought, well you know,</v>

183
00:11:41.091 --> 00:11:45.950
at least there is a place that I can hang out where people except me for being

184
00:11:45.951 --> 00:11:46.784
different

185
00:11:47.730 --> 00:11:52.260
<v 0>within a short while. Dana is not just going to meetings,</v>

186
00:11:52.261 --> 00:11:56.230
but it's protesting with the group because around that time,

187
00:11:56.231 --> 00:11:59.290
something called amendment two was proposed in Colorado.

188
00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:04.120
The amendment bans or repeals any state or local law that protects homosexuals

189
00:12:04.121 --> 00:12:08.290
from discrimination. A amendment to where was up in Colorado.

190
00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:12.550
So we got our shelves pretty organized.

191
00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:17.650
I went to the Larimer County Republican convention thing. Oh my God.

192
00:12:17.651 --> 00:12:22.420
Really? Did you speak? I tried to got booed off the stage. Oh, so you,

193
00:12:22.421 --> 00:12:24.910
so you became something of an activist? Yeah,

194
00:12:24.911 --> 00:12:28.210
I was a spokesman for the student alliance. Oh,

195
00:12:28.211 --> 00:12:30.880
so you really found a home there. That felt pretty good.

196
00:12:31.510 --> 00:12:35.350
That's what I started from waking up or being woke or whatever the term is.

197
00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:39.580
You start, you're starting to,

198
00:12:39.890 --> 00:12:44.770
I know I'm a lot more woke now than I was then. Um,

199
00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:49.780
it was like I got my first sip of coffee and the caffeine started or like, okay,

200
00:12:50.140 --> 00:12:53.680
activate your brain. You're like, oh, the world looks so different.

201
00:12:53.681 --> 00:12:58.350
So many colors. Yeah. There was one problem though,

202
00:12:58.700 --> 00:13:02.070
living as a gay man as I was at that time.

203
00:13:02.490 --> 00:13:07.050
Dana was not gay. No. They felt at home as a gay man,

204
00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:11.700
but they were mostly attracted to women and towards the end of college in their

205
00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:11.800
late thirties.

206
00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:11.981
<v 1>Well,</v>

207
00:13:11.981 --> 00:13:16.981
I was an art school working in the fibers department doing my studio classes and

208
00:13:19.670 --> 00:13:23.950
this morning when he kept coming in and watching me work,

209
00:13:24.190 --> 00:13:28.540
she got the Romy, I got to know her and we started dating.

210
00:13:29.380 --> 00:13:32.320
We got married. Really? Yeah.

211
00:13:33.070 --> 00:13:37.060
<v 0>Wow. You went all the way to marriage. Yup. And this is in,</v>

212
00:13:37.090 --> 00:13:39.770
this is early arts or like late night

213
00:13:41.150 --> 00:13:46.150
<v 1>two. Okay. 2007 we got divorced five years.</v>

214
00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:50.200
Yeah. Didn't work out. We both had issues. We weren't dealing with.

215
00:13:50.690 --> 00:13:54.800
<v 0>Dana says this period of their life up through the marriage and through the end</v>

216
00:13:54.801 --> 00:13:56.600
of it, it was very confusing.

217
00:13:56.890 --> 00:14:00.380
They were just trying to figure out where they stood and they were trying out

218
00:14:00.381 --> 00:14:03.340
all these terms like fuss, show,

219
00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:06.970
also true trans woman.

220
00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:09.200
How did that idea get into the room?

221
00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:10.150
<v 1>Well,</v>

222
00:14:10.150 --> 00:14:15.150
because I mean I was hearing more and more about trans people and starting to

223
00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:20.870
read a little bit about it. And so I'm like, well, maybe. Maybe.

224
00:14:20.980 --> 00:14:25.980
<v 0>And why did that feel more true than gay male or straight male?</v>

225
00:14:27.190 --> 00:14:29.290
<v 1>Because I, I knew this, uh,</v>

226
00:14:29.291 --> 00:14:33.580
there was a feminine quality about myself that I had to recognize. Okay.

227
00:14:33.581 --> 00:14:37.060
So I thought, well, if I'm not a man,

228
00:14:37.090 --> 00:14:38.950
I must be a woman in New York. Kind of.

229
00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:42.310
I thought it was going to be a trans woman,

230
00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:46.600
<v 0>meaning to Dana, a person who was born male, but identified as a woman. Right?</v>

231
00:14:46.780 --> 00:14:50.500
So you're like, holy crap. So you were like,

232
00:14:52.030 --> 00:14:55.310
hm, that's so interesting that like, well, that's where I went. You know,

233
00:14:55.340 --> 00:15:00.010
I can't explain how. Yeah, it's just, it's,

234
00:15:00.030 --> 00:15:02.760
it's um, like in Oh,

235
00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:07.670
in a world where there's limited words, you're just,

236
00:15:07.671 --> 00:15:11.780
you're just trying to figure out the word that fits you. Right.

237
00:15:12.230 --> 00:15:14.840
It's like these small steps towards a truth.

238
00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:20.060
<v 1>[inaudible] so, yeah, after the divorce, I'm, I'm looking,</v>

239
00:15:20.710 --> 00:15:24.550
uh, myself insane. Okay.

240
00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:28.720
What's going on here with me? This isn't working.

241
00:15:30.700 --> 00:15:33.430
<v 0>What Dana discovers after the break.</v>

242
00:15:37.150 --> 00:15:37.983
<v 8>So, cool.</v>

243

248
00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:09.200
<v 9>the rapper prodigy inspired pop and hip hop legends. But what inspired him?</v>

249
00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:12.230
I liked the angle to hip hop. It helped me get my aggression out.

250

<v 0>We're back. Episode Five, the story of Dana Zim. At this point,</v>

256
00:16:38.980 --> 00:16:42.550
Dana is divorced and feeling really unsure about who they are.

257
00:16:43.330 --> 00:16:47.880
They tried boy, girl, trans, bi, um,

258
00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:52.930
gay male and marriage and none of it seemed right.

259
00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:58.250
<v 1>It's really just shoveled. I was really, I was crying. I was like,</v>

260
00:16:58.790 --> 00:17:00.470
I wasn't taking care of myself.

261
00:17:02.410 --> 00:17:02.700
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

262
00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:04.020
<v 0>Dana says at this point,</v>

263
00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:07.230
<v 4>Woo.</v>

264
00:17:07.230 --> 00:17:12.230
<v 5>He started to really wonder where is all this confusion coming from?</v>

265
00:17:13.550 --> 00:17:18.300
Oh, I started digging deeper. Okay. A lot of stuff was going on.

266
00:17:18.660 --> 00:17:20.810
What happened to me as a child?

267
00:17:23.230 --> 00:17:23.720
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

268
00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:26.600
<v 10>Dana had always had these like memories.</v>

269
00:17:27.410 --> 00:17:32.000
Some of them hazy of having surgery as a kid, being like three, four, five,

270
00:17:32.001 --> 00:17:33.740
six and being in hospital.

271
00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:38.760
<v 1>Um, so I was pretty much there alone most of the time. Uh,</v>

272
00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:42.660
my grandparents visited remain once. My Dad was there once.

273
00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:48.060
<v 0>How many surgeries do you think there were? I don't know. Wow.</v>

274
00:17:48.510 --> 00:17:50.130
But more than definitely more

275
00:17:50.130 --> 00:17:53.280
<v 5>than one. Between three and six years, all I had multiple,</v>

276
00:17:53.281 --> 00:17:54.360
I just don't know how many

277
00:17:54.940 --> 00:17:59.240
<v 0>Dana only had like tiny fragments of these memories.</v>

278
00:17:59.390 --> 00:18:01.940
I mean it's hard to remember anything when you're three anyways,

279
00:18:02.420 --> 00:18:07.420
but now in their fifties Dana started to look back and wonder what were those

280
00:18:08.121 --> 00:18:09.920
surgeries also.

281
00:18:09.921 --> 00:18:14.150
Does that explain why I feel so different down there and like why I'm in pain

282
00:18:14.450 --> 00:18:18.990
<v 1>Britain that point I was in such pain that I was walking bull legged trying to</v>

283
00:18:18.991 --> 00:18:21.360
keep it. Anything from touching it. Huh?

284
00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:25.500
That's why I started looking up penis surgeries and we were trying to figure out

285
00:18:25.501 --> 00:18:26.400
what happened there.

286
00:18:27.020 --> 00:18:29.960
<v 0>Oh, so you're like, okay, I don't know what happened to me as a kid,</v>

287
00:18:29.961 --> 00:18:32.270
but I knew I had this pain and I know I have these surgeries,

288
00:18:32.271 --> 00:18:33.200
so maybe they're connected.

289
00:18:33.310 --> 00:18:35.610
<v 1>Right. So I started looking up that look global.</v>

290
00:18:35.620 --> 00:18:38.740
A lot of different diagrams on penis surgeries,

291
00:18:39.340 --> 00:18:43.000
all these different types and there's thousands of different fetal surgeries and

292
00:18:43.001 --> 00:18:45.070
I'm like, shit,

293
00:18:45.071 --> 00:18:49.300
I didn't know there was that many rock tie off dysfunction surgeries,

294
00:18:49.450 --> 00:18:52.360
penis farms in our Cape looking in and I'm like,

295
00:18:52.980 --> 00:18:56.890
I'm just trying to match up the scar tissues, you know, that was your approach.

296
00:18:57.210 --> 00:18:58.300
How am I approach?

297
00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:01.200
<v 0>Oh you must have seen some gnarly photos. Yeah.</v>

298
00:19:01.370 --> 00:19:04.280
And while searching all these photos on the Internet,

299
00:19:04.281 --> 00:19:07.880
Dana did start to see images where the scar tissue,

300
00:19:07.881 --> 00:19:10.670
like the patterns of the scars looked familiar.

301
00:19:11.060 --> 00:19:13.370
<v 1>That's why I found this term,</v>

302
00:19:14.790 --> 00:19:16.560
<v 11>Eh, intersex</v>

303
00:19:17.750 --> 00:19:20.950
<v 5>intersects in my, it just popped up on the screen,</v>

304
00:19:21.220 --> 00:19:26.140
pops up on one of the surgery, things intersects on my,

305
00:19:26.141 --> 00:19:28.630
what the hell is that? So I typed in,

306
00:19:28.631 --> 00:19:33.190
intersects over your whole unit and that was full of information and intersects

307
00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:34.153
and

308
00:19:36.520 --> 00:19:41.520
mills are really starting to go off reign in my head going oh maybe.

309
00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:45.273
Yeah.

310
00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:50.260
And I was just starting therapy at the VA hospital up in Cheyenne,

311
00:19:50.261 --> 00:19:51.250
Wyoming.

312
00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:56.520
She convinced me to go see a year old news at the Ba and he confirmed guessing

313
00:19:57.090 --> 00:19:58.060
DDI was intersects

314
00:20:01.810 --> 00:20:02.643
<v 11>[inaudible]</v>

315
00:20:05.270 --> 00:20:08.550
<v 0>what, what does intersex actually even mean in your case?</v>

316
00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:10.590
Cause it can mean a lot of things. Like what did,

317
00:20:10.591 --> 00:20:12.360
what did the doctors say to you?

318
00:20:12.470 --> 00:20:16.460
<v 1>You told me I was born with them as genitalia and that they can structured</v>

319
00:20:16.910 --> 00:20:18.980
basically my galitary org male.

320
00:20:19.490 --> 00:20:23.450
<v 0>In other words like Dana wasn't born with what the doctors would consider male</v>

321
00:20:23.451 --> 00:20:27.380
or female genitalia. It was like they had something that seemed to be there,

322
00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:30.050
an enlarged cliteracy or maybe a small penis.

323
00:20:30.051 --> 00:20:34.130
It was unclear and maybe there was a little bit of a vaginal opening.

324
00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:38.830
Um, in Dana's case and as is often the case with, uh,

325
00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:42.050
babies that are born this way, parents don't really know what to do.

326
00:20:42.051 --> 00:20:44.390
And the doctor will basically say, well, you got to pick one.

327
00:20:44.930 --> 00:20:46.130
And they picked male.

328
00:20:46.820 --> 00:20:48.190
<v 1>I exactly</v>

329
00:20:48.190 --> 00:20:52.030
<v 0>who made that decision. I think it was my father [inaudible] who said,</v>

330
00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:55.060
you're not going to cut that off. Looks like a penis. To me,

331
00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:59.140
that sounds like my father. But anyway,

332
00:20:59.770 --> 00:21:00.850
the doctors,

333
00:21:01.330 --> 00:21:06.330
they constructed a peanut should have been a large clutters probably.

334
00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:12.710
And that was it. How old were you at this point when you figured all this out?

335
00:21:13.420 --> 00:21:18.280
<v 1>50. You were 50 and I'm 60 now. 10 years ago.</v>

336
00:21:18.730 --> 00:21:19.630
Whoa.

337
00:21:20.630 --> 00:21:25.310
<v 0>You were five zero when you finally found out that you were intersex? Yep.</v>

338
00:21:26.180 --> 00:21:29.330
Dana says when they figured all this out,

339
00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:33.260
they had to like simultaneous feelings. One

340
00:21:33.370 --> 00:21:35.920
<v 1>I would, I was living.</v>

341
00:21:36.220 --> 00:21:38.910
Why didn't my parents tell me why?

342
00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:44.050
Just basically lie into my whole life. Did you call them? Yes.

343
00:21:45.130 --> 00:21:48.280
What did your mom say? Uh, not much.

344
00:21:50.050 --> 00:21:54.190
She basically was angry back at me. She said,

345
00:21:54.510 --> 00:21:57.310
your boy, you're always be a boy.

346
00:21:57.420 --> 00:22:00.690
<v 0>Was Your father still alive when you found out about the intersects?</v>

347
00:22:01.050 --> 00:22:03.750
<v 1>Oh yeah, I called him too. And what did he say?</v>

348
00:22:04.810 --> 00:22:09.810
He human heart a lot and Kinda said he was sorry. Uh,

349
00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:12.870
which is where we start reconciling.

350
00:22:13.110 --> 00:22:18.110
Did he explain where he was coming from at all when you were no.

351
00:22:19.710 --> 00:22:21.960
No, not really. But you know,

352
00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:26.490
I had to learn how to forgive myself for all my anger with my parents and

353
00:22:26.491 --> 00:22:27.630
forgive them as well.

354
00:22:29.610 --> 00:22:32.560
<v 0>But Dana says that like amidst processing that, right?</v>

355
00:22:33.100 --> 00:22:34.790
<v 1>Oh, is she actually your fork</v>

356
00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:37.220
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

357
00:22:37.220 --> 00:22:38.600
<v 5>for almost a year.</v>

358
00:22:40.740 --> 00:22:42.780
<v 0>Can you tell me about the euphoria? Why?</v>

359
00:22:42.990 --> 00:22:45.400
<v 5>Just because I finally had an answer. I mean,</v>

360
00:22:45.401 --> 00:22:49.660
it was the question I had asked and wondered about my entire life up to that

361
00:22:49.661 --> 00:22:53.440
point. The question being do my boy or girl.

362
00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:58.480
And the answer is yes. Both. Yes.

363
00:23:00.550 --> 00:23:04.840
So as you foreign, what is euphoria feel like to you?

364
00:23:04.870 --> 00:23:06.190
Walking on air.

365
00:23:10.970 --> 00:23:15.100
I know [inaudible] I had to break the binary or for race out.

366
00:23:15.101 --> 00:23:20.040
That was break the pioneer three. Yeah. Alright. Okay.

367
00:23:20.041 --> 00:23:22.350
If I'm not a man, I'm not a woman.

368
00:23:22.380 --> 00:23:25.870
I must be intersex or home Rafa night.

369
00:23:25.890 --> 00:23:27.720
And that works.

370
00:23:34.750 --> 00:23:35.010
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

371
00:23:35.010 --> 00:23:37.930
<v 5>but it's not a question I should've been asking. I was like, who am I?</v>

372
00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:39.090
And those kinds of things. But

373
00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:42.330
<v 0>you're saying the question you should've been asking is who am I not,</v>

374
00:23:42.331 --> 00:23:43.200
am I a boy or girl

375
00:23:43.300 --> 00:23:46.580
<v 1>and why and why I at, why I here? And those kinds of things.</v>

376
00:23:46.581 --> 00:23:47.510
Those are the questions,

377
00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:50.890
<v 0>the kind of question most people ask.</v>

378
00:23:51.790 --> 00:23:55.930
What Dana means is that those are the kinds of questions most people get to ask,

379
00:23:56.410 --> 00:24:01.410
but they were so forced into like wondering if they were a boy or a girl that

380
00:24:02.381 --> 00:24:07.240
they never got to get to like the big existential life questions that most of

381
00:24:07.241 --> 00:24:09.100
us, you know, wrestle with.

382
00:24:09.130 --> 00:24:12.370
They were just way back at ground zero or was stuck there.

383
00:24:13.420 --> 00:24:14.680
But I got on stock.

384
00:24:14.980 --> 00:24:19.150
What does it mean to like find a word that explains you? Uh,

385
00:24:19.810 --> 00:24:21.760
or so cool. Um,

386
00:24:22.620 --> 00:24:23.453
<v 5>okay.</v>

387
00:24:23.830 --> 00:24:25.390
<v 0>Yeah. Um,</v>

388
00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:30.240
<v 1>I think it was probably the happiest times in my life.</v>

389
00:24:30.460 --> 00:24:34.110
<v 0>You now identify as eh, or Herm Intersex,</v>

390
00:24:34.140 --> 00:24:36.690
non-binary Queer. Yup.

391
00:24:36.810 --> 00:24:39.990
Is there anything in that that,

392
00:24:40.140 --> 00:24:45.140
do you feel like fully free and found and sort of euphoric and you now or is

393
00:24:47.551 --> 00:24:49.830
there anything that still feels confining?

394
00:24:49.940 --> 00:24:52.940
<v 1>No, they pretty much as I am, I just had a tee shirt made up.</v>

395
00:24:53.130 --> 00:24:55.630
So is that Bruce's, you know, AAF at the bottom of it.

396
00:24:55.720 --> 00:25:00.010
<v 0>Hi, I'm Intersex, non-binary, queer as fuck as fuck.</v>

397
00:25:00.300 --> 00:25:03.610
Or in Bali. I don't know. Venture sex,

398
00:25:03.611 --> 00:25:06.670
non binary queer as fuck you like. That's pretty much it.

399
00:25:06.671 --> 00:25:11.620
I got to put on a t shirt, hope, nothing else changes and our socks.

400
00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:16.990
Non Binary Queer as fuck. Oh how are you going to put that? Yeah.

401
00:25:23.730 --> 00:25:25.870
Her sex non binary. Queer as fuck.

402
00:25:27.970 --> 00:25:30.010
Since discovering intersects 10 years ago,

403
00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:32.440
Dana's become involved in the community,

404
00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:35.770
a rapping and traveling to conferences.

405
00:25:35.771 --> 00:25:38.290
That's actually what kicked this whole passport thing off.

406
00:25:38.860 --> 00:25:40.480
And on May 29th of this year,

407
00:25:40.481 --> 00:25:44.110
Dana and the State Department were back in front of a judge arguing the case on

408
00:25:44.111 --> 00:25:47.530
its constitutional merits. No decision has been made.

409
00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:51.820
Dana's lawyers think we could see one this fall since Dana's case began.

410
00:25:51.850 --> 00:25:55.960
Now five states in Washington DC have non-gendered identification documents with

411
00:25:55.961 --> 00:25:56.980
more states proposed
