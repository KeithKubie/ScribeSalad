1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:05,290
[inaudible] so what do
you make of what's the,

2
00:00:05,871 --> 00:00:09,410
the onslaught against Christians?
Because I talk about it,

3
00:00:09,411 --> 00:00:13,940
I talk about it pretty frequently on, on
Twitter and here, and I'm not Christian,

4
00:00:13,941 --> 00:00:18,630
but I see what's going on. And this is
now the state sanctioned bigotry. Yeah.

5
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:20,520
That's okay. Not quite
state, but like, yeah.

6
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:22,490
If you care about what the
media is allowed, you know,

7
00:00:22,491 --> 00:00:26,450
you can always attack white Christian
man and they're all homophobes in,

8
00:00:26,451 --> 00:00:28,670
they're all big gates and
all of this nonsense. Yeah.

9
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:33,140
And I go to events with these people all
the time and I find them to be decent

10
00:00:33,141 --> 00:00:38,141
and respectful and willing to disagree
and walk away without punching you.

11
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:41,360
Yeah. And everything else. But what
do you make of just like the focus?

12
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:44,790
Yeah. On that. Well, it's part of,
it's part of intersectionality.

13
00:00:44,791 --> 00:00:47,850
You posted the quiz the
other day that it was like,

14
00:00:47,851 --> 00:00:51,010
what's your intersectionality score?
Intersectionality scores.

15
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:54,480
And one of the things that you could
slide was whether or not you're a devout

16
00:00:54,481 --> 00:00:56,820
Christian. The more devout
of a Christian, you are,

17
00:00:56,821 --> 00:01:01,080
I guess the more privileged Dui or the
lower you are in the intersectionality

18
00:01:01,081 --> 00:01:02,760
scale or something like that.

19
00:01:02,761 --> 00:01:07,050
And so I think it's just associated
because America and the West, uh,

20
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,480
why is driven by,
uh,

21
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:13,410
by Christianity and what's driven
specifically by Protestants.

22
00:01:13,411 --> 00:01:17,790
I mean the revolutionary war was seen
as a Presbyterian rebellion and a lot of

23
00:01:17,791 --> 00:01:22,260
those people line anything with anything
that is aligned with Americanism is

24
00:01:22,261 --> 00:01:26,970
white nationalist is wrong, is imperialist
Christianity gets tied up in that.

25
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:28,830
Now for Evangelical Christians,

26
00:01:28,831 --> 00:01:33,090
we also know because the Bible tells us
that the Church of Christ is going to be

27
00:01:33,091 --> 00:01:36,090
pushed to the margins and tell
the world comes to an end.

28
00:01:36,091 --> 00:01:38,890
And so we will be persecuted, we will, uh,

29
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:41,970
be more and more marginalized am yes,

30
00:01:41,971 --> 00:01:43,950
we can continue to fight
for Christian values.

31
00:01:43,951 --> 00:01:48,420
We continue to fight for being left alone
really is what we're really fighting

32
00:01:48,421 --> 00:01:49,890
for.
Just kind of leave us alone.

33
00:01:49,891 --> 00:01:54,660
That's what Protestants pretty much
have always done. Um, but yeah,

34
00:01:54,661 --> 00:01:56,100
I mean at the,
at the end of the day,

35
00:01:56,101 --> 00:01:59,220
we know that it's not going
to end well for us probably.

36
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:03,020
Yeah. It's really crappy
situation. Like every day,

37
00:02:03,021 --> 00:02:06,260
just another tweet and another
story, this nonsense, you know,

38
00:02:06,261 --> 00:02:10,670
they'll do Chris Pratt church and
they'll try to make it seem like, oh,

39
00:02:10,671 --> 00:02:14,000
he's a homophobe and he goes, he's
homophobic church and it's like, guys,

40
00:02:14,001 --> 00:02:16,760
you want to do a lot Omar's mosque,
now you want to do that.

41
00:02:16,761 --> 00:02:20,090
But they don't want to do that because
actually they're the bigots. Right.

42
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,590
That really is the truth.

43
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:25,050
Yeah. And that's the thing is that
they're fine. They're really fine.

44
00:02:25,051 --> 00:02:27,270
The left is fine with
you being a Christian,

45
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:30,990
as long as you don't actually
believe what the Bible says.

46
00:02:30,991 --> 00:02:35,010
So as long as you believe the
staff about feeding the poor,

47
00:02:35,011 --> 00:02:38,540
as long as you believe that kind of stuff.
But that has to mean the government,

48
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:42,360
they got rid of it, feeding the floor.
You have to do it their way. Right, right.

49
00:02:42,361 --> 00:02:45,750
Is longer. You're down with that, but
you have to take away the wrath of God.

50
00:02:45,751 --> 00:02:47,910
You had to take away
Jesus be the only way,

51
00:02:47,911 --> 00:02:49,860
truth and life you have to take
away the biblical marriage stuff.

52
00:02:49,861 --> 00:02:53,250
You have to take away the abortion
stuff if to take away the hard work that

53
00:02:53,251 --> 00:02:56,760
proverbs talks about that even the
apostle Paul talks about kind of take all

54
00:02:56,761 --> 00:02:57,241
that away.

55
00:02:57,241 --> 00:03:00,250
As long as you're the Christian that
believes in well three distribution.

56
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:00,970
You're good.

57
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:04,690
Yeah. Huh. All right. So let's dive
into some of the topics of the day.

58
00:03:04,691 --> 00:03:08,200
You mentioned the uh, the wage
gap. Yeah, it was recently. It was,

59
00:03:08,201 --> 00:03:09,160
what was the gender

60
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:13,770
pay gap day or Hashtag e you're saying
she don't even let her know our day,

61
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:17,650
even though I just made sure to pay
all my female plays less that day. Oh,

62
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:21,620
just really drive it home. Yeah.
Is it a myth? What's going on here?

63
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:24,480
It's a myth because,
well, it's partly a math.

64
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:28,680
What they don't tell you is the entire
story is this whole uncontrolled gap

65
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:30,450
through our versus the controlled gap.

66
00:03:30,451 --> 00:03:35,250
And actually heard about this
originally on a more left leaning site.

67
00:03:35,251 --> 00:03:39,120
That's an organization up in
Seattle that fights for equal pay.

68
00:03:39,121 --> 00:03:42,180
And they actually taught me on their site
the difference between an uncontrolled

69
00:03:42,181 --> 00:03:44,030
gap and a controlled gap.
The encore

70
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,640
toward a great Twitter
thread on this by the way,

71
00:03:45,641 --> 00:03:46,780
which we'll link to in the description.

72
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:48,030
Yeah,
yeah.

73
00:03:48,031 --> 00:03:52,080
It was the control the gap account or
I'll start with the uncontrolled gap,

74
00:03:52,081 --> 00:03:53,700
does not account for job title,

75
00:03:53,701 --> 00:03:55,890
doesn't account for experience
as an account for hours work.

76
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:59,640
It really doesn't put any factors
in. It's just the median, uh,

77
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:04,290
what women make versus the median, what
men make, which is 79 cents to a dollar.

78
00:04:04,291 --> 00:04:05,101
That is true,

79
00:04:05,101 --> 00:04:09,150
but it doesn't account for any choices
or an experience that controlled gap

80
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:13,470
accounts for all of those things.
So it accounts for job title hours worked,

81
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:16,290
all of that. It doesn't account for, uh,

82
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:20,370
like negotiating a raised as an account
for end of year bonuses or anything like

83
00:04:20,371 --> 00:04:20,731
that.

84
00:04:20,731 --> 00:04:25,560
But it does account for the big factors
and that is 99 cents on the dollar.

85
00:04:25,561 --> 00:04:30,000
So women make 99 cents to every
dollar that a man makes. But again,

86
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,610
you're not accounting
for a few factors there.

87
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:36,660
And that could be within the
margin of error. So no matter what,

88
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:41,400
there is no proof that there is
systemic sexism that is causing women,

89
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:42,840
uh,
to make less money.

90
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:46,380
Well, it also doesn't account for the
fact that men and women choose different

91
00:04:46,381 --> 00:04:48,690
careers. Yeah. At the
most simple level. I mean,

92
00:04:48,691 --> 00:04:51,530
the best example of this is Sweden
where they have been, you know,

93
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:55,050
completely egalitarian for ever basically,
I guess what,

94
00:04:55,051 --> 00:04:58,800
there is still more male engineers and
there's still more female versus, yeah.

95
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:01,590
So now they want to like force people to
do things that they don't actually want

96
00:05:01,591 --> 00:05:05,610
to do so they can get it 50 50 which yeah,
that's really how freedom work.

97
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:07,030
No. And there's, I mean,

98
00:05:07,031 --> 00:05:10,480
there's a million different programs
to try to get women into stem because

99
00:05:10,481 --> 00:05:14,200
they've said for so long that the reason
why there are so many more men in stem

100
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:19,440
is because women feel intimidated and
because there's this patriarchal attitude

101
00:05:19,931 --> 00:05:22,900
in the stem field,
while so they've tried so hard,

102
00:05:22,901 --> 00:05:25,090
they put so much money
behind it and still,

103
00:05:25,091 --> 00:05:28,890
I mean men are outpacing women or there
are so many more men in stem that,

104
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:30,730
I mean just as many as there's ever been.

105
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,290
And so it's probably
not 80 outside factor.

106
00:05:34,291 --> 00:05:36,820
It's probably because women
in general are different.

107
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:41,780
How much of this do you think is
just misguided sort of confusion.

108
00:05:41,781 --> 00:05:44,750
So for example, you're pregnant now,
your husband's here in the green room,

109
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:47,380
your career is there going to be a little
bit different because if you're going

110
00:05:47,381 --> 00:05:50,630
to probably take some time
off to child rear, yeah.

111
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:53,030
Maybe he will take some maternity
time. Maybe not. But yeah,

112
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:56,990
just physiologically we just
are different. They don't
like talking about that.

113
00:05:57,090 --> 00:06:00,020
Yeah. Um, but that is just
the nature of reality.

114
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:04,630
I saw a study the other day that it was
like breaking news and it was some study

115
00:06:04,631 --> 00:06:08,920
out of the UK that showed that there
is a difference between boys and girls

116
00:06:08,921 --> 00:06:13,270
brains inside the womb. That
is, uh, is it early as you know,

117
00:06:13,271 --> 00:06:16,930
however many weeks gestation that a
child's brain is developing and they start

118
00:06:16,931 --> 00:06:21,580
going in these divergent paths
of women. Um, the, just the,

119
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:23,040
how the neurons connected,

120
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:26,560
women kind of being grown into
these interpersonal creatures,

121
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:31,690
whereas men are more focused in
general on objects and data and things.

122
00:06:31,691 --> 00:06:36,310
Women are more focused on ideas and
words and people that starts in the womb.

123
00:06:36,311 --> 00:06:36,910
And I'm like,

124
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:41,350
I'm so glad science is finally catching
up to God and finally catching up to the

125
00:06:41,351 --> 00:06:43,390
things that we've known
for thousands of years.

126
00:06:43,391 --> 00:06:47,260
And so you do wonder if that's
going to happen, if, okay,

127
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:51,430
we're trying all of these cool social
experiments right now. Like maybe, oh,

128
00:06:51,431 --> 00:06:53,500
maybe it'll be fine if we draft women.

129
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:57,880
Like maybe it'll be fine if we just
pretend we just are totally gender neutral

130
00:06:57,881 --> 00:07:02,440
with our kids and pretend like no
binary definition of gender exists. Um,

131
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:05,260
but I do wonder if science will
catch up with us and be like,

132
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:09,730
actually all these things
that conservatives were
saying that the left dot,

133
00:07:09,731 --> 00:07:12,340
we're social constructs,
they're just biological reality.

134
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:12,761
Well,

135
00:07:12,761 --> 00:07:16,210
they also made find out what if they found
out that there was a gay gene one day?

136
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:18,010
Yeah. Now they're pro choice, would you,

137
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:22,720
you have to be okay then with a
woman deciding to abort that baby

138
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:24,670
because they don't want
the child to be gay.

139
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:27,910
And that does put them in this
kind of ethical conundrum. I mean,

140
00:07:27,911 --> 00:07:30,220
but it's the same thing with,
with race.

141
00:07:30,221 --> 00:07:33,250
I mean I guess you would know what race
your child is obviously before you had

142
00:07:33,251 --> 00:07:36,550
an ultrasound or anything
like that. But uh, you have,

143
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,720
I mean there is a racial
aspect to abortion and that
the majority of abortions

144
00:07:40,721 --> 00:07:45,160
happen in minority communities. And so
when you ask a pro choice or about that,

145
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,920
they don't typically have
any kind of answer though.

146
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:50,460
All right. Wage gap. Uh,

147
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:54,480
you briefly mentioned the trans
situation or gender roles. Yeah.

148
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:57,480
The trends issue for considering it's,
you know,

149
00:07:57,540 --> 00:08:01,680
0.01% of the population or something.
And I have complete sympathy. Yeah. Uh,

150
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:05,640
with the issues that they're dealing
with a little overblown in our national

151
00:08:05,641 --> 00:08:06,474
discussion.

152
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:08,700
Yes.
And I think that the left does that a lot.

153
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:11,880
Maybe I'm going to give them the benefit
of the doubt maybe with good intentions

154
00:08:11,881 --> 00:08:15,660
because people with gender dysphoria,
it truly is a struggle.

155
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:20,520
I know someone with gender dysphoria and
it is a struggle. They didn't want this.

156
00:08:20,521 --> 00:08:21,060
They didn't,

157
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:24,870
they don't like this kind of struggle of
feeling like they don't belong in their

158
00:08:24,871 --> 00:08:29,010
own body. It really is a psychological
struggle, but you treat it as a struggle.

159
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:31,080
You treat it as something that,
okay,

160
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:35,070
we don't just say while live what you
want to live because they actually,

161
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:38,450
the rates of suicide are pretty
much equal afterwards. Um,

162
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:41,190
it doesn't actually reconcile
anything when we say, okay,

163
00:08:41,191 --> 00:08:45,630
just do what you want to do because it
truly is a disorder in a dysphoria. Um,

164
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:49,740
and I think maybe in an attempt to be
compassionate to the people that are

165
00:08:49,741 --> 00:08:53,460
dealing with this and to help them
not feel ashamed that left to said,

166
00:08:53,461 --> 00:08:56,130
you know what?
We're just going to who you are.

167
00:08:56,370 --> 00:09:00,270
I personally don't think
that's the compassionate thing
to do, to lie to someone.

168
00:09:00,271 --> 00:09:03,090
And I know a lot of conservatives
feel the same way. Um,

169
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:06,930
but then you do start finding yourself
getting angry and defensive about a

170
00:09:06,931 --> 00:09:09,930
subject that we should have a lot of
sympathy for because people force you to

171
00:09:09,931 --> 00:09:12,240
use gender pronouns that
you don't want to use a,

172
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:14,370
they force you to have conversations
that you don't want to have.

173
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:18,090
And that's where things just get really
sticky. And that's when unfortunately,

174
00:09:18,091 --> 00:09:19,530
conservatives,
including me,

175
00:09:19,531 --> 00:09:22,560
we get really dogmatic about it and the
sympathy and compassion is thrown out

176
00:09:22,561 --> 00:09:23,250
the window.

177
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:24,930
Yeah.
So what do you do to fight that?

178
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:28,890
Cause that I get that it's tough if you
just keep being called to transfer over

179
00:09:28,891 --> 00:09:31,950
or any of these phobes well
eventually you're just like,

180
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,180
all right then enough of this,

181
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:37,560
I'm gonna go for the destroys tweet
and scatter of the compassion tweet.

182
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:40,810
Well the tweets are difficult
because the tweets, it's like

183
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:46,420
you only have so many
characters and putting out the
nuanced compassionate tweet

184
00:09:46,421 --> 00:09:50,500
is typically not what comes to mind. I
think when you're just trying to put your,

185
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:53,710
put your idea out there, you don't have
time to add. The new ones are like,

186
00:09:53,711 --> 00:09:55,750
I'm just going to get to the
point I want to say that's right.

187
00:09:55,930 --> 00:09:58,960
But that's typically my tendency and
our tendency and I don't think that's a

188
00:09:58,961 --> 00:09:59,441
good thing.

189
00:09:59,441 --> 00:10:03,070
But in conversations I always think it's
really important to define your terms.

190
00:10:03,071 --> 00:10:06,250
If you have a same leftist who was
saying you're a trans phobe. Okay,

191
00:10:06,251 --> 00:10:10,060
well we need to define phobia and we
need to define what I believe in what you

192
00:10:10,061 --> 00:10:13,270
believe and maybe we actually
agree on a lot of the same things.

193
00:10:13,271 --> 00:10:16,330
We just disagree on the facts.
We just disagree on the variables.

194
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:18,370
So I think defining
the terms is important.

195
00:10:18,371 --> 00:10:22,870
It starting with what you
agree is important. Uh, and
then working out from there.

196
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:24,640
How often do we do that?
Maybe not enough.

197
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:28,080
So would you, do you think it's fair to
say that the average conservative, well,

198
00:10:28,081 --> 00:10:30,620
first off, you know, the, when they
keep putting fold at the end of a word,

199
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,010
phobe is an irrational fear.

200
00:10:32,011 --> 00:10:35,730
So I assume you don't think
that the average conservative
has an irrational fear

201
00:10:35,731 --> 00:10:36,564
of trans people?

202
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:37,580
No,
I don't think so.

203
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:41,170
Okay. So what, what do you think the
average, do you think the average PR, uh,

204
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,170
conservative has the thoughts
that you laid out earlier,

205
00:10:44,171 --> 00:10:45,760
which is sort of a sympathy for this,

206
00:10:45,761 --> 00:10:50,270
but then we don't want that
to override or thinking brain,

207
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,560
something like that. I think some
people are saying you don't want,

208
00:10:53,561 --> 00:10:56,830
I really don't care if you dress like a
girl or you dress like a guy or you want

209
00:10:56,831 --> 00:10:58,900
to call yourself something.
Um,

210
00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:03,070
I just don't want you to force that on me.
I don't want you to take away,

211
00:11:03,071 --> 00:11:07,270
for example, my religious liberty
in lieu of like I, I, I don't know,

212
00:11:07,271 --> 00:11:11,560
they don't want their rights trampled
upon in favor of this small group.

213
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:13,570
Uh,
however,

214
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:17,650
I do think there are people that kind of
see where this line of reasoning goes,

215
00:11:17,651 --> 00:11:22,570
that if, okay, we deny
biological realities, we deny
what science is telling us,

216
00:11:22,571 --> 00:11:26,710
and we buy into this delusion that a man
can just wake up one day and say that

217
00:11:26,711 --> 00:11:31,540
he is a woman, then okay, we kind
of lose, we kind of lose all truth.

218
00:11:31,541 --> 00:11:34,660
What is truth anymore? It's just
what you feel. We lose identity.

219
00:11:34,661 --> 00:11:36,430
It's just who you say you are.

220
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:39,700
Or are you actually defined
in any way by biology?

221
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:43,000
And I think they see the kind of slippery
slope did that goes down and they say,

222
00:11:43,001 --> 00:11:45,750
okay, stop right there. I'm
not down with this. Okay. And

223
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:49,380
it all sounds crazy to just wake up
and you know, middle age and be like,

224
00:11:49,381 --> 00:11:52,950
well now I'm a female. But it's
like at that point, I mean this is,

225
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:53,830
this sounds bananas,

226
00:11:53,831 --> 00:11:58,180
but if you were a washed
up male NBA player couldn't
play in the league anymore.

227
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:01,750
You can be like, yeah, I'm a woman
today. I identify as woman, right? Yeah,

228
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:04,630
I'm jumping in then WMV and I'm
going to be the MVP, watch this.

229
00:12:04,631 --> 00:12:06,460
And then the feminist would have to say,

230
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:09,160
yeah, your lived experience. Yeah.

231
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:12,310
Well that's the other problem with
it is that you're kind of seeing some

232
00:12:12,311 --> 00:12:15,200
feminists pushback on this
and say, hang on. Well,

233
00:12:15,210 --> 00:12:17,170
old school feminists have
been kind of saying, okay,

234
00:12:17,171 --> 00:12:19,240
we fought for the uniqueness of women,

235
00:12:19,241 --> 00:12:24,241
the empowerment of women because women
are women and now men are beating us at

236
00:12:24,461 --> 00:12:27,880
our own. Gay Men are better at being
women than women are. That's not fair.

237
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:30,640
And so I do think you see
feminist pushing back on that,

238
00:12:30,641 --> 00:12:32,410
who truly do believe that.
Okay.

239
00:12:32,530 --> 00:12:35,290
The reason why we fought for the
empowerment of women is because women are

240
00:12:35,291 --> 00:12:38,110
unique. Only women can have children.
Only women can do certain things.

241
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:41,320
Women are better at some things that
men are. As far as leadership goes,

242
00:12:41,321 --> 00:12:43,360
as far as organization goes,
things like that.

243
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:45,940
And they fought to bring
those things to the forefront.

244
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:49,090
And now none of those things matter
anymore because you can be a man and be a

245
00:12:49,091 --> 00:12:52,580
woman. So there is just, I'm
just so glad I'm not on the lot.

246
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,970
It just seems so confusing.

247
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:58,300
It's quite miserable. It is. All right,

248
00:12:58,301 --> 00:13:02,140
so your Prager u video make men masculine
again. Why did they have a man do that?

249
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:05,260
Why did they have a, what was the
idea? We're going to have a woman. Yes.

250
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:07,210
Talk about male,
a male masculinity.

251
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:11,780
I think it's because you're seeing a lot
of women talk about how terrible toxic

252
00:13:11,781 --> 00:13:15,260
masculinity is and say, Oh man, they just,

253
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:19,160
they don't even know how hard today's
and David Presta us for so long.

254
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:23,780
We just need them to take a back seat
and so we can kind of step up and do our

255
00:13:23,781 --> 00:13:27,560
thing. And so I think they wanted
the perspective of a woman to say,

256
00:13:27,561 --> 00:13:32,510
hang on just a second. Women actually
do, not only do we like masculine men,

257
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:35,990
um, or it not even necessarily
traditional masculinity.

258
00:13:35,991 --> 00:13:38,300
I'm not talking about like
riding a four wheeler,

259
00:13:38,301 --> 00:13:42,140
I'm talking about taking responsibility
for your actions and taking care of your

260
00:13:42,141 --> 00:13:42,974
family.

261
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,300
I'm taking care of that provision and
protection that men are so good at it.

262
00:13:47,301 --> 00:13:51,320
And I think better at than women are.
Um, so you could still wear a nice shirt,

263
00:13:51,321 --> 00:13:54,230
let's say. Yes, you should be able
to take care of your family. Yeah.

264
00:13:54,231 --> 00:13:56,160
It's more internal traits
than anything else.

265
00:13:56,161 --> 00:13:59,420
And the actions and the habits that you
have, the responsibilities that you take.

266
00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:00,860
Women do care about that.

267
00:14:00,861 --> 00:14:05,570
And actually the complimentarian
relationship that men
and women have had for

268
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:10,100
ever, um, has, has worked really
well. It's worked really well.

269
00:14:10,101 --> 00:14:13,640
Not always. I mean, sometimes it goes
over to a patriarchy and that's not good.

270
00:14:13,641 --> 00:14:17,060
I don't think oppression of women is
good, but the, the ying and the Yang,

271
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:19,460
the back and forth and uh,

272
00:14:19,461 --> 00:14:22,970
the complimentarian relationship
that we've had has worked.

273
00:14:22,971 --> 00:14:25,310
And I think you kind of needed
to hear a woman say that.

274
00:14:25,311 --> 00:14:27,260
So why do you think the
left trying to destroy that?

275
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:30,680
Because they think a gala Tarion
is and will equal equality.

276
00:14:30,681 --> 00:14:32,330
So it's equality through homogeny,

277
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:35,810
which is part of why abortion is a
really big thing that they fight for.

278
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:38,540
If a man can physically walk
away from an unwanted pregnancy,

279
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:41,750
oh woman should be able
to too. I mean, pregnancy,

280
00:14:41,751 --> 00:14:45,500
the ability to get pregnant is really one,
not one of the only things,

281
00:14:45,501 --> 00:14:48,560
but probably the biggest thing
that makes a woman different.

282
00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:52,790
And so if we get rid of that through
abortion and that maybe men and women

283
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:55,610
really well be the same and
maybe they really will be equal,

284
00:14:55,611 --> 00:14:59,570
then there'll be no abuse, no oppression,
no patriarchy, things like that.

285
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:04,070
But I mean men are always going to be
physically stronger than women and there's

286
00:15:04,071 --> 00:15:07,940
always going to be bad men and that women.
So oppression won't stop,

287
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:09,110
abuse won't stop.

288
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:12,530
Egalitarianism is just going to make
or not shouldn't say egalitarianism,

289
00:15:12,531 --> 00:15:15,980
but sameness is going to make
things more confusing, not better.

290
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:20,120
So I know you do a public speaking too,
and when you go to colleges,

291
00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:23,670
do you find you have any
tricks on how to wake up,

292
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:28,650
say some of the lefties
that are, you know, at least
open to some of these ideas,

293
00:15:28,651 --> 00:15:30,390
but they're kind of like,
oh, she must be the bad guy,

294
00:15:30,391 --> 00:15:32,190
but I'll at least go and
sit in the back of the room.

295
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:35,940
Well,
what I tried to do is I try to,

296
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:40,970
my messages typically when I can usually
speaking to mostly conservative is that

297
00:15:41,101 --> 00:15:41,431
okay,

298
00:15:41,431 --> 00:15:44,520
you're hearing that you're crazy for
believing and things like border security

299
00:15:44,521 --> 00:15:46,890
for being prolife,
for being pro capitalism.

300
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:50,490
But here's where these ideas come
from and here's how they have worked.

301
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:55,670
And really only over the past 10 to 15
years have we heard all of this crazy

302
00:15:55,951 --> 00:15:56,940
intersectionality,

303
00:15:56,941 --> 00:16:00,630
identity politic stuff that they
are acting like his main stream.

304
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:03,180
And so you're not the extremist,
you're not the radical,

305
00:16:03,181 --> 00:16:04,380
you're not the one that's out there.

306
00:16:04,381 --> 00:16:07,110
You're not the Nazi and the big that
you believe things that Americans have

307
00:16:07,111 --> 00:16:09,130
believed since our founding.
Yeah.

308
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:11,790
And they have a really good
history and a really good basis.

309
00:16:11,791 --> 00:16:16,200
And so I don't know if that has
necessarily ever changed a leftist mind,

310
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:20,610
but it is something that's different than
just talking points and saying the is

311
00:16:20,611 --> 00:16:22,350
stupid. It saying, hey,

312
00:16:22,351 --> 00:16:25,860
we have good ideas and you have a right
to believe they're good ideas and you

313
00:16:25,861 --> 00:16:29,610
have a right to defend these
good ideas. Um, really the,

314
00:16:29,611 --> 00:16:33,300
the most disrespectful or the craziest.

315
00:16:33,301 --> 00:16:35,130
I always get very respectful,

316
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:38,760
great liberal students that come and
listen and ask awesome questions.

317
00:16:38,761 --> 00:16:42,390
I think the only time that has been like,
oh my gosh,

318
00:16:42,391 --> 00:16:46,140
I can't even get a word out without these
people screaming is when I was at UC

319
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:48,750
Berkeley and I spoke to yes.

320
00:16:48,751 --> 00:16:51,930
And I spoke to a class and the professor
was awesome for asking me and I

321
00:16:51,931 --> 00:16:53,820
actually thought when I went in
there, I was like, I'm gonna,

322
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:57,060
I'm gonna be really tame,
really tame with what I say.

323
00:16:57,061 --> 00:17:00,390
I'm not going to say I'm not gonna
throw any flames or anything like that.

324
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:05,400
Oh my gosh, I couldn't even, it was like
they had never heard a conservative idea.

325
00:17:05,401 --> 00:17:08,490
They'd never heard, uh,
someone who wasn't a liberal,

326
00:17:08,491 --> 00:17:11,460
utter a word and it was irrational.
It was irrational.

327
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:15,300
That was really my only experience
where I was like, this is crazy.

328
00:17:15,330 --> 00:17:16,190
They've abandoned thought.

329
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:20,130
Do you in a weird way, blame the baby
boomers for this cause it's their kids,

330
00:17:20,131 --> 00:17:24,000
right? Like, or it's the end of there.
The young end of their children,

331
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:26,380
like weird way.
You can't blame the,

332
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:30,360
the 16 year old who now gets into college,
you know, a couple of years go by,

333
00:17:30,361 --> 00:17:33,180
he's been indoctrinated in high school,
gets to college,

334
00:17:33,181 --> 00:17:36,480
gets slammed with more of this
up. I have sympathy for him. Well,

335
00:17:36,481 --> 00:17:38,260
when they're yelling at me, I don't
have that much sympathy for it. Yeah.

336
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:42,030
But like I have sympathy
for that condition because
they were just thrown into

337
00:17:42,031 --> 00:17:45,180
that. Yeah. Um, we're not that
you're looking to blame somebody,

338
00:17:45,181 --> 00:17:47,820
but if you had to sort of figure out
where this whole thing started. Yeah.

339
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:48,683
Where would you go?

340
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:50,010
Well,
the baby boomers

341
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:53,640
really liked to talk about how terrible
millennials are and I agree with them to

342
00:17:53,641 --> 00:17:54,151
some degree.

343
00:17:54,151 --> 00:17:58,380
I mean a lot of the stereotypes that
people have of us stare entitled and

344
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:03,030
apathetic or true,
but I remind them like we were raised,

345
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:04,740
like we were raised by someone,

346
00:18:04,741 --> 00:18:09,720
we weren't raised by wolves and I don't
think it's so much that parents probably

347
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:14,130
told their kids to be entitled
or told their kids to be spoiled.

348
00:18:14,131 --> 00:18:17,850
I don't know if it was a lack of
values that were taught in the family,

349
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:21,960
but also there was a significant change
from the time our parents were kids.

350
00:18:21,961 --> 00:18:23,580
Like my mom for example,

351
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:27,060
was you know she was driving to the
liquor store to get her dad beer when she

352
00:18:27,061 --> 00:18:31,140
was like 13 years old. I mean car seats,
like that just wasn't even a thing.

353
00:18:31,141 --> 00:18:34,050
I mean everything was a lot more
free to the time where we were kids.

354
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:38,430
I remember there was like a new law that
said you have to be in a car seat until

355
00:18:38,431 --> 00:18:42,270
you're like in second grade or
something like that. Everything changed.

356
00:18:42,271 --> 00:18:47,040
Everything became more safe and everything
shifted from like the latch key kids

357
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:49,710
who were coming home and
fending for themselves.

358
00:18:49,711 --> 00:18:53,490
That's mostly generation x because both
their parents had jobs to kind of these

359
00:18:53,491 --> 00:18:57,660
helicopter parents and these,
everybody gets a trophy or this,

360
00:18:57,661 --> 00:19:00,840
everybody gets a trophy
mentality that we had in school.

361
00:19:01,290 --> 00:19:03,850
It's not like we didn't have competition,
but it was the,

362
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:07,230
everyone gets some kind of reward. I
would know. I'm terrible at running.

363
00:19:07,231 --> 00:19:11,820
I'm so slow and yet in every race
I thought I got honorable mention,

364
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:16,180
honorable mention, I got something and
that's how we were raised. I swear to God.

365
00:19:16,181 --> 00:19:19,870
So I'm, I'm Gen x so I'm a
little yes, but I swear to God,

366
00:19:19,871 --> 00:19:23,140
I remember being in third or
fourth grade field day and I was,

367
00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:25,600
I was a scrawny little kid.
I was not a good athlete.

368
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:30,460
I became a good athlete later and I
remember getting a slip a field day.

369
00:19:30,461 --> 00:19:31,181
I did not place,

370
00:19:31,181 --> 00:19:34,690
I didn't get a medal and I
remember getting some sort
of participation thing and

371
00:19:34,691 --> 00:19:35,411
I'm not kidding.

372
00:19:35,411 --> 00:19:38,380
I remember as a third or fourth
grader thinking this is nonsense.

373
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:43,540
Like why would you give me this? I felt
shitty. I felt bad, I sucked it. Whatever.

374
00:19:43,541 --> 00:19:47,950
We were doing like a slow bike race
and I sucked. So why that, yeah,

375
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:52,180
we've, we've sold this as if
this is how it's supposed to be.

376
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:56,870
Yeah, I think, I mean it's parenting,
it's technology, its values, its purpose.

377
00:19:56,871 --> 00:19:59,180
It's so much,
I mean you do also,

378
00:19:59,181 --> 00:20:02,630
you can't deny just the effect of
personal technology hat on millennials.

379
00:20:02,631 --> 00:20:06,140
And I mean we had iPhones from
the time that we were probably 15.

380
00:20:06,141 --> 00:20:09,080
We had cell phones.
Even before that we had my space.

381
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:12,830
Zenga if anyone remembers
that you had a Facebook, oh,

382
00:20:12,831 --> 00:20:15,770
I think it was before my today. I didn't
have it, but I remember some people did.

383
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:17,450
You had AOL instant messenger.

384
00:20:17,451 --> 00:20:21,800
So you had personalized technology from
a really young age that told us that

385
00:20:21,801 --> 00:20:25,940
everything is about you. Um,
everything is focused on you.

386
00:20:25,941 --> 00:20:28,730
And then the older that we got, we
got Netflix, we've got Uber eats,

387
00:20:28,731 --> 00:20:31,160
we got all of these things that
made life really convenient.

388
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:34,940
Instant gratification. Always. We
don't know anything other than Amazon.

389
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,730
I don't know how to read a map.
Like I don't,

390
00:20:37,731 --> 00:20:41,120
I remember my dad tried to teach me how
to read a map in high school. I was like,

391
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:42,530
yeah, dad. Okay.

392
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:46,560
Do you remember Dennis had to refold
it. Yeah. The rest it's like whatever,

393
00:20:46,561 --> 00:20:48,580
but then you can just fold it
back in the way it came out.

394
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:52,150
Well, I don't even know how to do that.
So, and I think most millennials don't,

395
00:20:52,151 --> 00:20:57,151
and so this instant gratification things
should be easy for me as they are in

396
00:20:57,221 --> 00:21:00,180
the technological world has
really affected our politics too.

397
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:05,200
Do you feel that the technological part
of this is actually really screwed up a

398
00:21:05,201 --> 00:21:06,640
generation then like that?

399
00:21:06,641 --> 00:21:09,680
There's obviously a lot of goodness and
we're doing this on youtube. Yeah, yeah.

400
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:13,240
All of that. But that it really
like we have, we handed everybody,

401
00:21:13,241 --> 00:21:14,170
it didn't matter what age you are.

402
00:21:14,171 --> 00:21:18,610
We all got handed this incredible
technology to open the world, our heads,

403
00:21:18,611 --> 00:21:22,540
but especially if you're a 15 year
old being handed that. Yeah, that's,

404
00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:24,030
that's a lot to give a kid.

405
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:24,551
Yeah.

406
00:21:24,551 --> 00:21:29,551
I want to hesitate to blame
all of all of it on technology.

407
00:21:29,891 --> 00:21:34,000
I also see a loss of values and that
we're not only the most progressive

408
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:34,601
generation,

409
00:21:34,601 --> 00:21:37,750
but we're also the most irreligious
generation where the biggest generation of

410
00:21:37,751 --> 00:21:42,700
religious nones in o n e s and I
do think a lot of us are wandering,

411
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,640
looking for truth, not really
knowing what that is. Not me,

412
00:21:45,641 --> 00:21:47,380
but a lot of people in our generation.

413
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:51,520
I don't know if that comes with
technology at all or if that's connected,

414
00:21:51,521 --> 00:21:55,390
but it certainly a factor in why you
think millennials just don't have any

415
00:21:55,391 --> 00:21:56,200
center.

416
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:59,890
They don't have any grounding and they
just think that their centers themselves,

417
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,230
they were told this all
the time on social media.

418
00:22:02,231 --> 00:22:06,100
I mean your favorite fitness blog or your
favorite self help author is just love

419
00:22:06,101 --> 00:22:08,170
yourself. If you just look
in the mirror in the morning,

420
00:22:08,171 --> 00:22:10,450
you tell yourself you're awesome,
that you're enough,

421
00:22:10,451 --> 00:22:13,000
then you're going to be fine
and that's what you need to do.

422
00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:16,930
Everything's about my happiness. So you
cut out the toxic people in your life.

423
00:22:16,931 --> 00:22:18,760
You cut out the things
that you don't like,

424
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:23,170
the things that make you sad and
you just do you be pretty lonely?

425
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:26,980
Yeah,
I mean there's right and w I mean,

426
00:22:26,981 --> 00:22:29,080
what do you do when
the self love runs out?

427
00:22:29,081 --> 00:22:30,760
What do you do when the
self esteem runs out?

428
00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:33,400
What do you do when you wake up in
the morning and you're like, okay,

429
00:22:33,401 --> 00:22:36,880
I'm not that awesome and I
haven't accomplished that much.

430
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:40,600
Should you just continue to
coddle yourself or should
you do something about it?

431
00:22:40,601 --> 00:22:42,730
In the millennial is told cuddle,

432
00:22:42,731 --> 00:22:45,250
you'll be flying and then you have
someone like AOC saying, well,

433
00:22:45,251 --> 00:22:48,370
we're going to provide economic security
for people who are unwilling to work.

434
00:22:48,371 --> 00:22:52,720
And so if you just want to
be, uh, a watercolor painter,

435
00:22:52,721 --> 00:22:55,270
even if you suck at it,
you should just keep doing it.

436
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:59,710
Yeah. So that's where a lot of money
in watercolor paint in general.

437
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:04,070
I wouldn't know because I'm not
good at it, but, um, I can imagine

438
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:09,230
gay marriage, let's talk about it. Oh,
okay. From a Christian perspective.

439
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:12,380
So when we're posting this, uh, we're
holding this video for a couple of days,

440
00:23:12,381 --> 00:23:16,880
but I just had a Shapiro in here and
we've talked about gay marriage and he

441
00:23:16,881 --> 00:23:20,960
talks about his feelings from it
Orthodox Jewish perspective. And we can,

442
00:23:21,050 --> 00:23:25,880
we've basically gotten it to the place
where we agree to disagree and we agree

443
00:23:25,881 --> 00:23:26,691
to disagree on the,

444
00:23:26,691 --> 00:23:30,140
on the fact that he's not okay with
it through a religious perspective,

445
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:34,190
but he's not trying to legislate my
life and I as a citizen of this country,

446
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:38,720
I'm completely okay with that. Yeah, I
suspect that's probably similar to yours.

447
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:43,330
It is similar now as a Christian,
there is a little bit of,

448
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:46,220
um,
I would say a second layer to that.

449
00:23:46,221 --> 00:23:50,330
So he obviously believes
that homosexuality is wrong
because the old testament

450
00:23:50,331 --> 00:23:52,790
says it. We believe it, not
just because the old testament,

451
00:23:52,791 --> 00:23:54,680
but it's reiterated in the New Testament.

452
00:23:54,681 --> 00:23:59,330
And then there is this crazy picture
in metaphor that is given to us in

453
00:23:59,331 --> 00:24:01,550
Ephesians five that says,
okay,

454
00:24:01,551 --> 00:24:05,990
marriage is a reflection of
what Christians call Christ
in the Church as Christ

455
00:24:05,991 --> 00:24:09,110
is the head of the church.
So the husband is the head of the wife.

456
00:24:09,290 --> 00:24:11,000
And so it's this,
um,

457
00:24:11,090 --> 00:24:14,750
husbands are to love their wives as
Christ loves the church and wives are

458
00:24:14,751 --> 00:24:17,000
supposed to submit to their
husbands as to the Lord.

459
00:24:17,001 --> 00:24:18,890
So there's this spiritual component,

460
00:24:18,891 --> 00:24:23,240
this gospel component to marriage
being between a man and a woman.

461
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:27,200
So there really is no theological
way for any Christian. They try,

462
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:30,140
but to get out of the
dynamic that God set up,

463
00:24:30,141 --> 00:24:33,260
not just biologically and physically,
but also spiritually.

464
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:36,860
And so that's where I stand as
far as religious perspective.

465
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,480
Now I've heard both sides of it.

466
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:43,510
I have heard conservatives and even
libertarians that I respect saying,

467
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:46,700
you know what, I, I
just can't get behind a,

468
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:51,750
I just can't get behind gay marriage
from even a civics perspective or from a

469
00:24:51,801 --> 00:24:52,740
legal perspective.

470
00:24:52,850 --> 00:24:55,880
You heard Libertarians make that argument?
I've heard it. I've heard liberty.

471
00:24:55,970 --> 00:24:57,920
I would say not anyone famous.

472
00:24:57,921 --> 00:25:01,610
I would say friends who probably have
libertarian views still saying maybe that

473
00:25:01,611 --> 00:25:03,470
was,
maybe they don't feel that way anymore.

474
00:25:03,471 --> 00:25:07,100
But just say it's so hard for me to
separate the personal from the political,

475
00:25:07,101 --> 00:25:10,040
but where I stand politically
is probably the same.

476
00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:13,430
I would say probably the same
place as been dies. I mean,

477
00:25:13,431 --> 00:25:15,380
one gay marriage is here to stay.

478
00:25:15,381 --> 00:25:18,710
There's nothing that's going to be
done about it. And I don't think I,

479
00:25:18,711 --> 00:25:22,430
or probably any other evangelical in
the political world is going to fight

480
00:25:22,431 --> 00:25:23,760
against it.
But I think

481
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:27,020
what does that tell you quickly
about the delicacies in general?

482
00:25:27,021 --> 00:25:29,750
Because I think this is important.
I've, I've said this many times,

483
00:25:29,751 --> 00:25:33,410
but it's like nobody cares
about gay marriage anymore
really in the big picture.

484
00:25:33,411 --> 00:25:36,710
Like I get your, your theological,
yeah. Personal belief,

485
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:39,030
but in the public political space,
yeah.

486
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:44,110
Something that was an Athema to this
group of people for a long time now has

487
00:25:44,151 --> 00:25:47,150
become normalized pretty quickly I think.
I think by and large,

488
00:25:47,151 --> 00:25:50,240
Christians have realized that their
communities are, and getting worse,

489
00:25:50,241 --> 00:25:53,090
that the neighbors next door have kids
and they're the same as everybody else.

490
00:25:53,390 --> 00:25:58,340
That you don't even hear Mike Huckabee
going on about it anymore. Or, or, um, uh,

491
00:25:58,370 --> 00:26:01,370
Rick Santorum or any of these guys,
they've sort of moved on.

492
00:26:01,371 --> 00:26:05,390
And I think this is where I would love
the progressive's have a little humility.

493
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:10,460
Yeah. Like just a little bit of, you know
what me, maybe you guys were wrong, right?

494
00:26:10,461 --> 00:26:13,790
You were wrong, but then something
happened and you did you let it go? Yeah.

495
00:26:13,791 --> 00:26:14,600
Basically.

496
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:18,800
And that would show a little humanity
and humility and they just refused to do

497
00:26:18,801 --> 00:26:21,710
that. And again, this is
where then I can find myself,

498
00:26:21,711 --> 00:26:24,410
be building bridges with you
guys all the time because, yeah.

499
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:26,410
Because there's a place
to build a bridge to.

500
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:27,180
Yeah.

501
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:31,970
I think that a lot of evangelical
conservatives realized,

502
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:33,030
okay,
yes,

503
00:26:33,270 --> 00:26:36,930
America was founded on Christian values
and we should continue to perpetuate

504
00:26:36,931 --> 00:26:39,750
those Christian values.
But the state does not define marriage.

505
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:44,760
God defines marriage. And I think that,
uh, churches it be free to say, sorry,

506
00:26:44,761 --> 00:26:48,480
we're not gonna, we're not gonna marry
two men. You know? And I agree. Right.

507
00:26:48,481 --> 00:26:50,910
And Yeah, and I knew that you did. Um,

508
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,910
and I think that we kind of made that
separation and it say and said, okay,

509
00:26:53,970 --> 00:26:55,620
God defines marriage in the Bible.

510
00:26:55,800 --> 00:27:00,000
If I don't want to get on board with
it because I am beholden to God and God

511
00:27:00,001 --> 00:27:01,020
above the state,

512
00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:04,590
then that's fine in churches shouldn't
be beholden to the state in that regard

513
00:27:04,591 --> 00:27:08,070
either. And I think that we kind
of decided, okay, that's fine.

514
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:11,490
If they want to get married according
to the state's definition of marriage,

515
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:12,840
that's okay.

516
00:27:12,990 --> 00:27:17,070
But I and my congregation are not going
to change our views on it and we just

517
00:27:17,071 --> 00:27:19,710
kind of want to be left
alone in that regard.

518
00:27:19,810 --> 00:27:21,550
Yeah. So what would you,
what do you make of when,

519
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:24,470
when churches do perform
gay marriages? Like, yeah,

520
00:27:24,530 --> 00:27:29,240
just sort of skirting their
theological, yeah. The,

521
00:27:29,470 --> 00:27:30,290
or integrity.

522
00:27:30,290 --> 00:27:31,123
Oh yeah.
I mean,

523
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:34,280
this is a huge thing in the United
Methodist church is that they've kind of

524
00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:39,230
almost had a split because they voted on
this so called traditional plan saying,

525
00:27:39,231 --> 00:27:41,060
okay,
if you're a Methodist church,

526
00:27:41,061 --> 00:27:44,600
if you're under the United Methodist
Church umbrella, this denomination,

527
00:27:44,810 --> 00:27:48,710
you can't perform gay marriage or
you can't. Yeah. You can't perform,

528
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,270
you can perform these marriages.

529
00:27:50,271 --> 00:27:54,140
And there were a lot of people who
are really upset about that. And,

530
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:58,250
but from a Christian perspective,
you just can't get around it.

531
00:27:58,251 --> 00:27:59,390
There's no way to get,

532
00:27:59,391 --> 00:28:03,020
there's no way theologically to get
around it without making some serious,

533
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:06,200
not just physical concessions,
but spiritual concessions.

534
00:28:06,201 --> 00:28:10,370
And so my question for anyone,
and it's not just about gay marriage,

535
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:13,940
it's about anything in the Bible.
My question is,

536
00:28:13,941 --> 00:28:17,780
if you don't take the Bible
as God tells us to take it,

537
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:21,830
why are you a Christian? Find a different
hobby. Like there's that you can,

538
00:28:21,870 --> 00:28:24,860
you know, you can be a
moral person. You can, yeah,

539
00:28:24,861 --> 00:28:28,850
you can be a good person and you can
believe in feeding the poor without

540
00:28:28,851 --> 00:28:31,400
following Christ.
But Christ tells us to deny yourself,

541
00:28:31,401 --> 00:28:32,930
take up our cross and follow him.

542
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:36,290
And part of that is adhering to the
word even when it's inconvenient and not

543
00:28:36,291 --> 00:28:37,220
culturally cool.

544
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:41,840
So I'm just a little bit confused
by those theological concessions.

545
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:44,690
Um, but yes, to answer your question,

546
00:28:44,691 --> 00:28:47,450
I do think that it's compromising
on what the Bible says.

547
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:51,440
Yeah. What do you think that would
actually in practice, what does that mean?

548
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:53,270
You know what I mean?
Like, so in practice,

549
00:28:53,271 --> 00:28:56,690
gay people start getting married now
doesn't matter. Outside of the church,

550
00:28:57,100 --> 00:29:01,070
what do you think the practice of that
would lead to in society? That would be

551
00:29:01,650 --> 00:29:03,690
all right. Are you talking about
Oh, okay. Outside of the church.

552
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:05,650
So like I understood. Yeah.
Outside of the church.

553
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:07,410
Did you see that some sort of problem?

554
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:11,410
Well, I, I, I of course do you think
that God's way is better than Nan's way?

555
00:29:11,411 --> 00:29:15,790
And I do believe that God's setting up
marriage as a union between a man and a

556
00:29:15,791 --> 00:29:19,060
woman is better. I think
that it's better for, uh,

557
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:21,220
I think it's better for the family.
I think it's better for children.

558
00:29:21,221 --> 00:29:24,310
And I think because it's better for the
family, it's better for society now.

559
00:29:24,311 --> 00:29:27,820
Do I think it's going to be
the degradation of society?
Do I think that we're,

560
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:33,310
our whole thing is going to hell in a hand
basket because of that? Uh, no I don't.

561
00:29:33,311 --> 00:29:34,001
But of course,

562
00:29:34,001 --> 00:29:37,540
I think that the way God set up marriage
and family and the Bible is better than

563
00:29:37,541 --> 00:29:40,240
how secular society does it.
Um,

564
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:44,140
and so that's where I feel that,
I feel like we are,

565
00:29:44,141 --> 00:29:46,360
I feel like we'll probably be going.
However,

566
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:50,560
homosexuality isn't different or are
necessarily worse than other sense.

567
00:29:50,561 --> 00:29:53,920
It's a different kind of sin because it's
a sexual sin according to Christianity,

568
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:55,420
but it's not worse.

569
00:29:55,421 --> 00:29:58,630
We don't believe that it puts us in a
worse place than all of the other sense

570
00:29:58,631 --> 00:29:59,060
that American.
Yeah.

571
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:00,920
Dot. Well, I know what's
going to happen now,

572
00:30:00,921 --> 00:30:03,200
so people are going to clip this and
they're, they're going to go out. See,

573
00:30:03,201 --> 00:30:06,740
there's Reuben sitting with another
homophobe right to his face sitting in his

574
00:30:06,741 --> 00:30:10,970
house where he lived. You like hanging
out with homophones. It's just like,

575
00:30:11,030 --> 00:30:14,630
I don't, I mean, I said it to
Ben, so I'll say it to you like,

576
00:30:14,990 --> 00:30:18,840
as long as you're not trying to
legislate my life, I don't care. Yeah.

577
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:21,290
Maybe there's a part of me that I'm like,
maybe I should care more.

578
00:30:21,291 --> 00:30:22,910
Should I be more offended?
Or something like that.

579
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:26,630
Don't, well, I think
part of it too is one,

580
00:30:26,631 --> 00:30:30,530
you want to be left alone like so many
people like Christians due to go live

581
00:30:30,531 --> 00:30:33,770
your life. Yeah, you want to be
left alone. And I think also,

582
00:30:33,890 --> 00:30:35,540
and you can correct me if I'm wrong,

583
00:30:35,570 --> 00:30:39,170
but a lot of the problem that especially
Christians see on the left is that they

584
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:42,200
conflate sexuality with identity.

585
00:30:42,230 --> 00:30:46,730
And so if I disagree with your
relationship from a Christian perspective,

586
00:30:47,090 --> 00:30:50,450
um, then that must mean that I
hate you, but I don't hate you.

587
00:30:50,451 --> 00:30:51,650
I think that you're a great person.

588
00:30:51,651 --> 00:30:55,010
I think you're a smart person and
your husband's awesome. And so they,

589
00:30:55,011 --> 00:30:58,040
a lot of people on the left seem to not
be able to separate those two things.

590
00:30:58,041 --> 00:31:02,450
That I can love you as a person and
respect you and admire you as a person and

591
00:31:02,451 --> 00:31:05,660
not agree from my own Christian
perspective with your relationship.

592
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:09,470
Now I also think it's important
to say though, it's not.

593
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:12,980
If I were to what Christians
would say witness to you,

594
00:31:13,130 --> 00:31:17,810
if I were to share the gospel with you,
it would not be, hey Dave, you're gay.

595
00:31:17,811 --> 00:31:22,520
And that's wrong. That would not be the
message. What we believe that unbelievers,

596
00:31:22,521 --> 00:31:25,850
people who are not Christians are
repenting from when they come to Christ is

597
00:31:25,910 --> 00:31:26,743
unbelief.

598
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:31,730
It is not your primarily your primary
San is that you're gay or that you are a

599
00:31:31,731 --> 00:31:35,330
thief or that's your anything else.
It's that you don't believe in Christ.

600
00:31:35,510 --> 00:31:37,070
And so that's what we believe,

601
00:31:37,071 --> 00:31:41,840
that we are preaching the Gospel to
unbelievers to be saved, not a gay people,

602
00:31:41,841 --> 00:31:45,490
to make them straight. Now we do
believe that through sanctification, uh,

603
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:49,040
that we all have to repent
from our sense. But, uh,

604
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:51,020
I think it's important
also to distinguish that,

605
00:31:51,021 --> 00:31:53,450
that what we're talking about salvation
and sharing the gospel with people.

606
00:31:53,451 --> 00:31:55,940
It's not necessarily saying,
uh,

607
00:31:56,510 --> 00:31:58,820
our primary message isn't that
you're gay and that's bad.

608
00:31:58,900 --> 00:31:59,320
Yeah.

609
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:03,100
What do you think people could just stop
being gay if they repented and stuff?

610
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:05,550
Well,
I know two different stories.

611
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:11,200
There is a really good book by someone
who I totally disagree with and so many

612
00:32:11,431 --> 00:32:15,880
ways in so many ways, but, uh, she,

613
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:18,300
she wrote a good book. Now,
she probably wouldn't say that,

614
00:32:18,330 --> 00:32:21,540
oh God makes people straight, but
it's called gay girl. Good God.

615
00:32:21,541 --> 00:32:22,740
It's by Jackie Hill Perry.

616
00:32:22,741 --> 00:32:26,260
And she did live life as a gay person
and then she kind of had an awakening.

617
00:32:26,290 --> 00:32:29,700
She came to God and she's married and she
has kids. There are stories like that,

618
00:32:29,701 --> 00:32:31,820
but I also know stories of people.
Um,

619
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:36,310
there is another amazing story and I
don't want to say the title because I'm a,

620
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:40,140
I don't want to say the title,
but there is another story of,

621
00:32:40,141 --> 00:32:44,210
of someone who became a Christian.
He lived life as a gay person.

622
00:32:44,211 --> 00:32:46,580
He actually was in prison,
um,

623
00:32:46,610 --> 00:32:51,610
and he lived life as a gay person and
he at became a Christian and he lives,

624
00:32:51,890 --> 00:32:54,890
as far as I know,
he loves to sell a bit lifestyle.

625
00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:57,860
And so he is not married.

626
00:32:58,010 --> 00:33:00,320
He is probably never going to be married.

627
00:33:00,321 --> 00:33:02,300
He might not ever be attracted to women,

628
00:33:02,301 --> 00:33:06,860
but because he is a Christian and Jesus
has called us to deny ourselves whatever

629
00:33:06,861 --> 00:33:10,340
our desires are that are simple,
uh, he loves the celibate lifestyle.

630
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:11,353
And so I think

631
00:33:11,650 --> 00:33:14,440
this strikes me as deeply sad.
Like I can get it. Yeah. You know,

632
00:33:14,441 --> 00:33:16,990
like I really like, you know, I'm
pretty tolerant about this stuff.

633
00:33:17,030 --> 00:33:21,850
Obviously that one just strikes
me as he, he is gay. He,

634
00:33:21,851 --> 00:33:26,380
there is this religious
piece of him in there that,

635
00:33:26,381 --> 00:33:30,100
so the answer is then live alone and
don't have kids and don't have a family.

636
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:30,571
Yeah.

637
00:33:30,571 --> 00:33:35,430
But that is where you start completing
sexuality with identity and romantic

638
00:33:35,431 --> 00:33:37,440
relationships with the
ultimate fulfillment.

639
00:33:37,441 --> 00:33:41,130
And that's not what the Christian
beliefs actually Paul says for everyone,

640
00:33:41,131 --> 00:33:43,770
it's better to be single than
to be married. Um, he says,

641
00:33:43,771 --> 00:33:45,150
I wish you were all like I was.

642
00:33:45,151 --> 00:33:48,330
So you can be fully dedicated to the Lord
and we believe that if you're straight

643
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:51,120
or gay straight or you're
same sex attracted,

644
00:33:51,270 --> 00:33:55,620
then the gift of celibacy is truly a
gift that you can dedicate all of your

645
00:33:55,621 --> 00:34:00,570
passions to God. Um, so we
don't see celibacy as this sad,

646
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:04,320
awful lonely thing. We believe that
in Christ you have full fulfillment,

647
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:08,130
full satisfaction, whether
you are attracted to the
opposite sex or the same sex.

648
00:34:08,131 --> 00:34:12,480
And so I think he would tell
you, great person had on,
I'll tell you his name, but,

649
00:34:12,570 --> 00:34:13,010
uh,

650
00:34:13,010 --> 00:34:16,530
I would think he would tell you that he
finds full satisfaction and full of joy

651
00:34:16,730 --> 00:34:19,110
and his relationship with Christ.
Now that does not mean it's easy.

652
00:34:19,170 --> 00:34:19,591
Right?
Well,

653
00:34:19,591 --> 00:34:22,530
I was gonna say he would also sort of
have to say that to rationalize his

654
00:34:22,531 --> 00:34:23,910
existence, right? Like

655
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:27,170
may I, I don't know. I'd be
happy to have the conversation.

656
00:34:27,171 --> 00:34:28,490
I'm not sure that he would,

657
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:33,740
I don't think he would have chosen
because he was living and actively gay

658
00:34:33,741 --> 00:34:37,910
lifestyle. His name's Christopher.
You won. And I think he's incredible.

659
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:42,880
I don't think he would have chosen to
be a Christian or I don't think he would

660
00:34:42,881 --> 00:34:47,450
have become a Christian. Um, if he didn't
think that there was something to it,

661
00:34:47,451 --> 00:34:49,190
if he didn't think that it was worth it.
I mean,

662
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:52,610
he's seeing the two alternatives
and he chose one direction.

663
00:34:52,611 --> 00:34:56,240
So he obviously thinks that one is
more satisfying than the other. I mean,

664
00:34:56,390 --> 00:35:00,380
he got nothing out of, at least hand
to bully in this life saying, okay,

665
00:35:00,381 --> 00:35:02,240
I'm going to give that up.
And become a Christian.

666
00:35:02,610 --> 00:35:03,443
Yeah.

667
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:06,130
So it makes you wonder,
it does make you wonder.

668
00:35:06,131 --> 00:35:07,690
It should make you wonder
about Christianity.

669
00:35:07,930 --> 00:35:11,920
What is it about Jesus that would make
someone give up what they thought their

670
00:35:11,921 --> 00:35:14,920
identity was? Where the world
says, well, that's where love is,

671
00:35:14,921 --> 00:35:19,090
is just being yourself and loving who
you want to love. What kind of God,

672
00:35:19,470 --> 00:35:20,360
what is their degree.
