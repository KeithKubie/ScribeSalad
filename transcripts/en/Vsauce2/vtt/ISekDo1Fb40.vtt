00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:08.380
The Brazilian Encantado is a mythological
Were-Dolphin that transforms into a human

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:13.240
at night to take pleasure in human activities
such as festivals. They have the power to

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:19.039
control storms and hypnotize humans, as well
as cast spells that cause sickness, insanity,

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:25.110
and death. The Were-Dophins also seduce beautiful
women and impregnate them before returning

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:30.100
to the river to become dolphins, once again.
But they never fully transform into humans

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:34.739
and have to wear hats to conceal their unchanged
blow holes.

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.829
What the FAK: The facts and knowledge on mythical
monsters.

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:44.630
Kraken are legendary sea-monsters believed
to live in the waters off the coasts of Norway

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:50.270
and Iceland that attack ships. It's said that
they wrap their arms around the ship, capsizing

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:54.700
it, drowning or eating the crew. The Kraken
was brought to the attention of the masses

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:59.620
in the Natural History of Norway written by
the Bishop of Bergen who collected the stories

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:03.520
of fishermen said to have encountered it.
In reality, it's suspected that the Kraken

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:08.780
may be linked to the Giant squid which is
40-50 feet in length, and have reportedly

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:10.430
attacked ships.

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.880
Somewhat of a newcomer on the monster scene
is the Chupacabra, which translates to "goat

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.970
sucker". First reported in 1995, this vampiric
creature is mostly reported in Northern Mexico

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.580
and the Southern United States, and blamed
for sucking the blood out of sheep, chickens

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:31.100
and other livestock. It was originally described
as a bipedal, reptile-like creature with sharp

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:36.299
quills running down its back that hops like
a kangaroo, but has more recently been described

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:41.080
as a hairless, wild dog, which are probably coyotes infected with a parasite

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.930
that alters their appearance. No evidence
of the Chupacabra's supposed victims actually

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.880
being drained of their blood has ever been
found.

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.979
The Mongolian Death Worm is said to inhabit
the Southern Gobi Desert in Mongolia. Witnesses

00:01:53.979 --> 00:02:00.150
claim it's bright red with a thick body and
2-5 feet in length, with the ability to spew

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:05.720
deadly acid and electrocute its victims from
a distance with an electrical discharge. It's

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:10.810
also believed that touching any part of the
worm causes instant death. While scientists

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:16.470
note that acid spraying and huge worms are
found in nature - they're dubious of the electrical

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:22.910
discharge claim, and, despite several investigations,
The Mongolian Death Worm has yet to turn up.

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:27.910
The concept of men transforming into wolves,
or Lycanthropy, dates back to ancient Greek

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:32.420
mythology. The term has been linked to the
story of Lycaon, who was turned into a wolf

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:37.400
as punishment by Zeus. Some authors believe
that the werewolf legends were used to explain

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:42.730
serial killings where victims appeared to
be brutalized. One famous instance being Peter

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:49.730
Stumpp, an alleged German serial killer executed
in 1589 known as the Werewolf of Bedburg.

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:54.410
Although modern researchers have tried to
link ailments such as rabies and hypertrichosis

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:59.450
to Werewolf origins, these are not believed
to have had any significant, if any, influence

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:00.500
on the legends.

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:06.090
Lou Garooh is the French version of the Werewolf
but has a distinct and more frightening difference:

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:10.300
the ability to switch between human and wolf
form at will with no dependence on the moon

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:13.860
cycles that the more popular Werewolf follows.

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:18.120
Bigfoot is a giant ape-like creature believed
to live in the forests of North America's

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:24.209
Pacific Northwest. The name Bigfoot came into
popularity in 1958 when footprints were found

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:29.190
in California and cast into plaster. The story
was published and picked up by the associated

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:34.420
press and the name caught on. The hunt for
evidence proving the existence of this 6-10

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:39.519
foot hairy, humanoid creature includes a recently
published, and high-questionable, study claiming

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:42.069
evidence of Bigfoot's DNA.

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:47.730
Giant footprints are often used as proof,
but turn out to be hoaxes, and Bigfoot supporters

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:53.159
believe the creature to be an remnant of Gigantopithecus-
the largest ape that ever lived, at almost

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:58.319
10 feet tall, whose fossils are found in Asia.
But while the scientific community discounts

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:03.620
the existence of Bigfoot, the legend of a
giant ape-like creature is found in many cultures

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:10.620
all around the world...

00:04:28.789 --> 00:04:33.650
On November 5th, 1966, two young couples had
the first reported sighting of what is now

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:39.139
called the Mothman. An enormous, winged creature
that terrorized Point Pleasant, West Virginia

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:44.199
in the late 1960s. It was believed to be involved
with the collapse of the Silver Bridge that

00:04:44.199 --> 00:04:50.080
killed 46 people and injured 9, being sighted
at the event by many eyewitnesses. Between

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:56.449
1966 and 1967, over 100 people claimed to
have seen the creature, all reporting it standing

00:04:56.449 --> 00:05:02.279
around 7 feet tall with bat-like wings and
red eyes. After the bridge collapsed there

00:05:02.279 --> 00:05:06.699
were only a few sightings of Mothman, and
then it quietly disappeared. But, there are

00:05:06.699 --> 00:05:11.649
similar claims around the world of a creature
surrounding huge disasters, and some believe

00:05:11.649 --> 00:05:15.569
that it either appears before the disasters,
or possibly causes them.

00:05:15.569 --> 00:05:20.749
"It can be seen from a distance within the
distance in the treetops;however, search parties have

00:05:20.749 --> 00:05:22.259
been unable to find it."

00:05:22.259 --> 00:05:27.169
The Wendigo is a demonic spirit believed by
Algonquin Native American tribes to take over

00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:31.839
humans and turn them into cannibals. Once
possessed, they turn into a monster that has

00:05:31.839 --> 00:05:37.490
an unrelenting need for human flesh. They
are said to be human-like but very tall and

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:42.610
thin with yellowish decaying skin. By eating
human flesh someone makes themselves vulnerable

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:47.529
to the demon and it was preferable to kill
ones self than resort to cannibalism. Wendigo

00:05:47.529 --> 00:05:52.349
Psychosis is a condition where even people
with access to food will be overwhelmed with

00:05:52.349 --> 00:05:57.889
the need to eat human flesh, such as Swift
Runner that famously killed his entire family

00:05:57.889 --> 00:06:03.439
in 1878 and ate them despite being 25 miles
from a supply post.

00:06:03.439 --> 00:06:08.129
Vampire mythology, in many forms, long predate
Bram Stoker's Dracula, going as far back as

00:06:08.129 --> 00:06:13.509
the Mesopotamians and Ancient Greeks. But
the European legends of the early 18th century

00:06:13.509 --> 00:06:18.449
are where most modern folklore originate.
Vampires were described as being bloated and

00:06:18.449 --> 00:06:23.629
purplish in color from drinking blood, with
blood coming from their mouth and nose. One

00:06:23.629 --> 00:06:28.789
of the methods for escaping the pursuit of
a vampire was to drop salt or seeds, which

00:06:28.789 --> 00:06:33.990
the vampires are compelled to count each and
every fallen grain of- a disorder known as

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:38.429
Arithmomania. There were many methods from
different cultures for preventing vampires

00:06:38.429 --> 00:06:43.949
from rising from their graves including a
brick in the mouth, holy water on the body,

00:06:43.949 --> 00:06:49.179
pouring boiling water over the grave, or pinning
the corpse to the Earth with metal spikes

00:06:49.179 --> 00:06:52.080
or, of course, wooden stakes.

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:57.909
The 18-Century Vampire Controversy saw widespread
fear of Vampires throughout Europe, and led

00:06:57.909 --> 00:07:02.999
to villagers digging up corpses and often
mistaking normal decomposition for evidence

00:07:02.999 --> 00:07:08.219
of vampires. Intestinal decomposition leads
to bloating, causing blood to be forced up

00:07:08.219 --> 00:07:12.889
into the mouth - creating the illusion that
the dead had been sucking blood.

00:07:12.889 --> 00:07:18.860
Yara-Ma-Ya-Who is a small, red vampiric creature
from Australian Aboriginal Folklore. He's

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:23.879
around 4 feet tall, with a large mouth with
no teeth and suckers on the ends of his toes

00:07:23.879 --> 00:07:29.149
and fingers to stick to victims and suck their
blood out. He doesn't hunt for food; rather,

00:07:29.149 --> 00:07:33.959
he waits in trees for an unsuspecting person
to walk by, drops onto the them, drains their

00:07:33.959 --> 00:07:39.469
blood, but leaves them with enough to stay
alive. After working up an appetite the Yara-Ma-Yah-Who

00:07:39.469 --> 00:07:44.740
returns and swallows the victim whole and
then regurgitates them. If the victim plays

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:49.209
dead they may escape as the Yara-Ma-Yah-Who
will only eat people that are alive. If he

00:07:49.209 --> 00:07:53.439
realizes you're alive, he'll continue to eat
and regurgitate you, with the victim becoming

00:07:53.439 --> 00:07:58.149
shorter and redder each time until they become
a Yara-Ma-Yah-Who.

00:07:58.149 --> 00:08:02.550
I'm gonna leave you with this Celtic mythological
creature. What is it, and how does it kill

00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:04.539
its victims?
