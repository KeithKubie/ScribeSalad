00:00:00.222 --> 00:00:01.110
- [Voiceover] So, let's say I have

00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:04.129
some multi-variable function like F of XY.

00:00:04.129 --> 00:00:06.428
So, they'll have a two variable input,

00:00:06.428 --> 00:00:08.065
is equal to, I don't know,

00:00:08.065 --> 00:00:11.663
X squared times Y, plus sin(Y).

00:00:11.663 --> 00:00:13.125
So, allow for just a single number.

00:00:13.125 --> 00:00:14.994
It's a scalar valued function.

00:00:14.994 --> 00:00:16.770
Question is, how do we take the derivative

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.733
of an expression like this?

00:00:18.733 --> 00:00:21.089
And there's a certain method
called a partial derivative,

00:00:21.089 --> 00:00:23.017
which is very similar
to ordinary derivatives

00:00:23.017 --> 00:00:24.677
and I kinda wanna show
how they're secretly

00:00:24.677 --> 00:00:25.815
the same thing.

00:00:25.815 --> 00:00:27.951
So, to do that, let me
just remind ourselves

00:00:27.951 --> 00:00:32.050
of how we interpret the notation
for ordinary derivatives.

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:35.579
So, if you have something
like F(X)=X squared,

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.075
and let's say you wanna
take its derivative,

00:00:38.075 --> 00:00:41.547
and I'll live nets notation here, df/dx,

00:00:41.547 --> 00:00:44.712
and let's evaluate it at two, let's say.

00:00:44.712 --> 00:00:46.593
I really like this notation
because it's suggestive

00:00:46.593 --> 00:00:47.591
of what's going on.

00:00:47.591 --> 00:00:49.674
If we sketch out a graph,

00:00:51.318 --> 00:00:54.975
so this axis represents our output,

00:00:54.975 --> 00:00:56.752
this over here represents our input,

00:00:56.752 --> 00:00:59.549
and X squared has a certain
parabolic shape to it.

00:00:59.549 --> 00:01:01.036
Something like that.

00:01:01.036 --> 00:01:05.552
Then we go to the input,
x equals one, two.

00:01:05.552 --> 00:01:07.932
This little DX here, I like to interpret

00:01:07.932 --> 00:01:10.589
as just a little nudge in the X direction.

00:01:10.589 --> 00:01:12.666
And it's kind of the size of that nudge.

00:01:12.666 --> 00:01:14.666
And then DF,

00:01:15.714 --> 00:01:18.212
is the resulting change in the output

00:01:18.212 --> 00:01:21.254
after you make that initial little nudge.

00:01:21.254 --> 00:01:22.658
So, it's this resulting change.

00:01:22.658 --> 00:01:23.954
And when you're thinking
n terms of graphs,

00:01:23.954 --> 00:01:24.787
this is slope.

00:01:24.787 --> 00:01:26.640
You kind of have this rise over run

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.161
for your ratio between the tiny change

00:01:28.161 --> 00:01:31.122
of the output that's caused
by a tiny change in the input.

00:01:31.122 --> 00:01:33.466
And of course, this is
dependent on where you start.

00:01:33.466 --> 00:01:35.766
Over here we have X=2.

00:01:35.766 --> 00:01:37.804
But, you could also think
about this without graphs

00:01:37.804 --> 00:01:39.243
if you really wanted to.

00:01:39.243 --> 00:01:41.124
You might just think about,

00:01:41.124 --> 00:01:43.563
your input space as just a number line

00:01:43.563 --> 00:01:47.730
and your output space,
also as just a number line,

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.285
the output of F over here.

00:01:50.285 --> 00:01:53.083
And really, you're just thinking
of somehow mapping numbers

00:01:53.083 --> 00:01:55.439
from here onto the second line.

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:56.925
And in that case, your initial nudge,

00:01:56.925 --> 00:01:59.190
your initial little DX,

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:01.883
would be some nudge on that number line.

00:02:01.883 --> 00:02:02.905
And you're wondering how

00:02:02.905 --> 00:02:05.142
that influences the function itself.

00:02:05.142 --> 00:02:08.357
So maybe that causes a nudge
that's four times as big

00:02:08.357 --> 00:02:13.188
and that would mean your
derivative is four at that point.

00:02:13.188 --> 00:02:15.000
So, the reason I'm talking about this is

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.822
because over in the multi-variable world,

00:02:16.822 --> 00:02:19.905
we can pretty much do the same thing.

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:26.423
You can write df/dx and
interpret that as saying,

00:02:26.423 --> 00:02:29.510
hey how does a tiny change in
the input in the X direction

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:31.577
influence the output.

00:02:31.577 --> 00:02:33.457
But, this time, the way
that you might visualize it,

00:02:33.457 --> 00:02:35.141
you'd be thinking of your input space.

00:02:35.141 --> 00:02:38.380
Here, I'll draw it down
here, as the XY plane.

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:40.157
So, this time, this is not
gonna be graphing the function,

00:02:40.157 --> 00:02:43.512
this is, every point on
the plane is an input.

00:02:43.512 --> 00:02:45.104
And let's say you were evaluating this

00:02:45.104 --> 00:02:47.187
at a point like one, two.

00:02:49.274 --> 00:02:53.118
In that case, you'd go over
to the input that's one

00:02:53.118 --> 00:02:56.079
and then two, and then you'd say, okay,

00:02:56.079 --> 00:02:57.797
so this tiny nudge in the input,

00:02:57.797 --> 00:03:01.964
this tiny change DX, how does
that influence the output.

00:03:03.103 --> 00:03:04.380
And in this case the output, I mean,

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:05.526
it's still just a number.

00:03:05.526 --> 00:03:08.057
So maybe we go off to the side here

00:03:08.057 --> 00:03:12.446
and we draw just like a
number line as our output.

00:03:12.446 --> 00:03:14.548
And somehow we're thinking
about the function

00:03:14.548 --> 00:03:17.137
as mapping points on the
plane to the number line.

00:03:17.137 --> 00:03:19.076
So you'd say, okay, that's your DX,

00:03:19.076 --> 00:03:21.177
how much does it change the output?

00:03:21.177 --> 00:03:23.394
And, maybe this time it
changes it negatively.

00:03:23.394 --> 00:03:25.066
It depends on your function.

00:03:25.066 --> 00:03:26.715
And that would be your DF.

00:03:26.715 --> 00:03:28.874
And you can also do this
with the Y variable, right.

00:03:28.874 --> 00:03:32.541
There's no reason that
you can't say DF, DY,

00:03:34.268 --> 00:03:37.834
and evaluate at that same point, one, two.

00:03:37.834 --> 00:03:40.457
And interpret totally the same way.

00:03:40.457 --> 00:03:43.394
Except, this time your DY would be

00:03:43.394 --> 00:03:46.355
a change in the Y direction.

00:03:46.355 --> 00:03:48.421
So maybe I should really
emphasize here that

00:03:48.421 --> 00:03:52.822
that DX is a change in
the X direction here

00:03:52.822 --> 00:03:54.866
and that DY is a change
in the Y direction.

00:03:54.866 --> 00:03:57.721
And maybe, when you change
your F according to Y,

00:03:57.721 --> 00:03:58.801
it does something different.

00:03:58.801 --> 00:04:02.851
Maybe, the output increases
and it increases by a lot,

00:04:02.851 --> 00:04:04.128
it's more sensitive to Y.

00:04:04.128 --> 00:04:06.401
Again, it depends on the function.

00:04:06.401 --> 00:04:08.625
And I'll show you how you can
compute something like this

00:04:08.625 --> 00:04:10.065
in just a moment here.

00:04:10.065 --> 00:04:12.340
But, first there's kind of
an annoying thing associated

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:14.605
with partial derivatives,
where we don't write them

00:04:14.605 --> 00:04:17.228
with D's in DX/DF.

00:04:17.228 --> 00:04:19.293
People came up with this new notation,

00:04:19.293 --> 00:04:21.835
mostly just to emphasize to the reader

00:04:21.835 --> 00:04:23.075
of your equation that it's

00:04:23.075 --> 00:04:25.119
a multi-variable function involved.

00:04:25.119 --> 00:04:28.579
And what you do, is
you say, you write a D,

00:04:28.579 --> 00:04:30.680
but it's got kind of a curl at the top.

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:33.072
It's this new symbol and
people will often read it

00:04:33.072 --> 00:04:34.279
as partial.

00:04:34.279 --> 00:04:36.589
So, you might read like
partial F, partial Y.

00:04:36.589 --> 00:04:37.710
If you're wondering, by the way,

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:39.213
why we call these partial derivatives,

00:04:39.213 --> 00:04:41.350
it's sort of like, this
doesn't tell the full story

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:44.112
of how F changes 'cause it only
cares about the X direction.

00:04:44.112 --> 00:04:46.794
Neither does this, this only
cares about the Y direction.

00:04:46.794 --> 00:04:50.997
So, each one is only a
small part of the story.

00:04:50.997 --> 00:04:53.749
So, let's actually evaluate
something like this.

00:04:53.749 --> 00:04:56.071
I'm gonna go ahead and
clear the board over here.

00:04:56.071 --> 00:04:58.988
I think the one-dimensional analogy

00:04:59.937 --> 00:05:03.104
is something we probably have already.

00:05:04.933 --> 00:05:06.600
So, little remnants.

00:05:08.647 --> 00:05:10.690
So, if you're actually
evaluating something like this,

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:12.240
here, I'll write it up here again up here.

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:15.607
Partial derivative of
F, with respect to X,

00:05:15.607 --> 00:05:17.046
and we're doing it at one, two.

00:05:17.046 --> 00:05:19.926
It only cares about
movement in the X direction,

00:05:19.926 --> 00:05:21.540
so it's treating Y as a constant.

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:23.501
It doesn't even care about
the fact that Y changes.

00:05:23.501 --> 00:05:26.264
As far as it's concerned,
Y is always equal to two.

00:05:26.264 --> 00:05:28.947
So, we can just plug
that in ahead of time.

00:05:28.947 --> 00:05:31.025
So, I'm gonna say partial, partial X,

00:05:31.025 --> 00:05:32.198
this is another way you might write it,

00:05:32.198 --> 00:05:33.800
put the expression in here.

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:35.646
And I'll say X squared,
but instead of writing Y,

00:05:35.646 --> 00:05:40.018
I'm just gonna plug in that
constant ahead of time.

00:05:40.018 --> 00:05:42.050
'Cause when you're only
moving in the X direction,

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:45.207
this is kind of how the
multi-variable function

00:05:45.207 --> 00:05:46.380
sees the world.

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:47.529
And I'll just keep a little note

00:05:47.529 --> 00:05:51.685
that we're evaluating this
whole thing at X equals one.

00:05:51.685 --> 00:05:53.845
And here, this is actually
just an ordinary derivative.

00:05:53.845 --> 00:05:55.842
This is an expression that's an X,

00:05:55.842 --> 00:05:57.642
you're asking how it changes

00:05:57.642 --> 00:06:00.010
as you shift around X and
you know how to do this.

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:03.830
This is just taking the derivative

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:05.697
of X square times two

00:06:05.697 --> 00:06:09.794
is gonna be 4x 'cause
X squared goes to 2x.

00:06:09.794 --> 00:06:11.281
And then the derivative of a constant,

00:06:11.281 --> 00:06:15.146
sin of two is just a constant, is zero.

00:06:15.146 --> 00:06:17.520
And of course we're evaluating
this at X equals one,

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:20.791
so your overall answer is gonna be four.

00:06:20.791 --> 00:06:22.033
And as for practice, let's also do

00:06:22.033 --> 00:06:24.111
that with derivative with respect to Y.

00:06:24.111 --> 00:06:27.385
So, we look over here, I'm
gonna write the same thing.

00:06:27.385 --> 00:06:29.254
You're taking the partial derivative of F

00:06:29.254 --> 00:06:31.391
with respect to Y.

00:06:31.391 --> 00:06:34.073
We're evaluating it at
the same point one, two.

00:06:34.073 --> 00:06:39.024
This time it doesn't care about
movement in the X direction.

00:06:39.024 --> 00:06:40.676
So, as far as it's concerned,

00:06:40.676 --> 00:06:43.021
that X just stays constant at one.

00:06:43.021 --> 00:06:47.188
So, we'd write one squared
times Y, plus sin(Y).

00:06:49.221 --> 00:06:51.270
Sin(Y).

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:52.103
And you're saying, oh,

00:06:52.103 --> 00:06:55.492
I'm keeping track of this at Y=2.

00:06:55.492 --> 00:06:58.094
So, it's kind of, you're
evaluating at Y=2.

00:06:58.094 --> 00:07:01.275
When you take the
derivative, this is just 1xY.

00:07:01.275 --> 00:07:03.399
So the derivative is one.

00:07:03.399 --> 00:07:07.566
This over here, the
derivative is cosine, cos(Y).

00:07:10.377 --> 00:07:14.347
Again, we're evaluating
this whole thing at Y=2.

00:07:14.347 --> 00:07:15.567
So, you're overall answer,

00:07:15.567 --> 00:07:18.126
it would be 1+cos(2).

00:07:18.126 --> 00:07:20.575
I'm not sure what the value of cos(2) is

00:07:20.575 --> 00:07:21.597
off the top of my head,

00:07:21.597 --> 00:07:23.443
but that would be your answer.

00:07:23.443 --> 00:07:27.401
And, this is a partial
derivative at a point,

00:07:27.401 --> 00:07:29.946
but a lot of times, you're
not asked to just compute it

00:07:29.946 --> 00:07:31.894
at a point, what you
want is a general formula

00:07:31.894 --> 00:07:34.421
that tells you, hey, plug in any point XY

00:07:34.421 --> 00:07:36.477
and it should spit out the answer.

00:07:36.477 --> 00:07:39.217
So, let me just kinda go
over how you would do that.

00:07:39.217 --> 00:07:40.564
It's actually very similar,

00:07:40.564 --> 00:07:42.537
but this time, instead of
plugging in the constant

00:07:42.537 --> 00:07:44.360
ahead of time, we just have to pretend

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:45.544
that it's a constant.

00:07:45.544 --> 00:07:49.711
So let me make a little bit
of space for ourselves here.

00:07:53.628 --> 00:07:56.189
We don't need any of this anymore.

00:07:56.189 --> 00:08:00.356
I'm gonna leave the partial
partial F, partial partial Y.

00:08:01.378 --> 00:08:05.545
We want this as a more
general function of X and Y.

00:08:09.644 --> 00:08:11.664
Well we kind of do the same thing.

00:08:11.664 --> 00:08:13.290
We're gonna say that this is derivative

00:08:13.290 --> 00:08:14.334
with respect to X,

00:08:14.334 --> 00:08:16.389
and I'm using partials
just to kind of emphasize

00:08:16.389 --> 00:08:18.293
that it's a partial derivative.

00:08:18.293 --> 00:08:20.011
And now, we'd write X squared

00:08:20.011 --> 00:08:24.923
and then kind of emphasize that
it's a constant value of Y,

00:08:24.923 --> 00:08:28.463
plus the sin, and again,

00:08:28.463 --> 00:08:29.508
I'll say Y.

00:08:29.508 --> 00:08:33.281
And here, I'm writing the variable Y,

00:08:33.281 --> 00:08:34.999
but we have to pretend
like it's a constant,

00:08:34.999 --> 00:08:36.644
you're pretending that you plugin two

00:08:36.644 --> 00:08:37.583
or something like that.

00:08:37.583 --> 00:08:39.324
And you still just take the derivative.

00:08:39.324 --> 00:08:40.485
So, in this case,

00:08:40.485 --> 00:08:42.587
the derivative of X
squared times a constant,

00:08:42.587 --> 00:08:45.170
is just 2x times that constant.

00:08:47.563 --> 00:08:50.407
And over here, the derivative
of a constant is always zero.

00:08:50.407 --> 00:08:52.427
So that's just always gonna be zero.

00:08:52.427 --> 00:08:54.029
So, this is your partial derivative

00:08:54.029 --> 00:08:55.736
as a more general formula.

00:08:55.736 --> 00:08:56.637
If you plugged in one,

00:08:56.637 --> 00:08:59.075
two to this, you'd get what we had before.

00:08:59.075 --> 00:09:00.468
And similarly, if you're doing this

00:09:00.468 --> 00:09:02.551
with partial F partial Y,

00:09:06.714 --> 00:09:08.131
we write down all of the same things,

00:09:08.131 --> 00:09:10.534
now you're taking it with respect to Y.

00:09:10.534 --> 00:09:14.701
And I'm just gonna copy
this formula here actually.

00:09:23.467 --> 00:09:25.035
But this time, we're considering all

00:09:25.035 --> 00:09:26.857
of the the X's to be constants.

00:09:26.857 --> 00:09:28.356
So, in this case, when
you take the derivative

00:09:28.356 --> 00:09:29.911
with respect to Y of
some kind of constant,

00:09:29.911 --> 00:09:31.909
constant squared is a constant,

00:09:31.909 --> 00:09:35.751
times Y, it's just gonna
equal that constant.

00:09:35.751 --> 00:09:37.632
So, this is gonna be X squared.

00:09:37.632 --> 00:09:40.174
And over here, you're taking
the derivative of sin(Y).

00:09:40.174 --> 00:09:44.341
There's no X's in there,
so that remains the sin(Y).

00:09:47.106 --> 00:09:48.387
Now this is a more general formula.

00:09:48.387 --> 00:09:50.430
If you plugged in one,
two, you would get one.

00:09:50.430 --> 00:09:53.776
I'm sorry that's cos(y).

00:09:53.776 --> 00:09:57.943
Cos(y) because we're taking a derivative.

00:09:59.869 --> 00:10:01.062
So, if you plugged in one, two,

00:10:01.062 --> 00:10:03.245
you would get 1+cos(1),

00:10:03.245 --> 00:10:04.603
which is what we had before.

00:10:04.603 --> 00:10:06.705
So this, this is really what you'll see

00:10:06.705 --> 00:10:08.829
for how to compute a partial derivative.

00:10:08.829 --> 00:10:10.965
You pretend that one of
the variables is constant

00:10:10.965 --> 00:10:12.544
and you take an ordinary derivative.

00:10:12.544 --> 00:10:13.437
And in the back of your mind,

00:10:13.437 --> 00:10:14.270
you're thinking this is

00:10:14.270 --> 00:10:16.484
because you're just
moving in one direction

00:10:16.484 --> 00:10:19.270
for the input and you're seeing
how that influences things.

00:10:19.270 --> 00:10:22.510
And then, you might move in
one direction for another input

00:10:22.510 --> 00:10:24.309
and see how that influences things.

00:10:24.309 --> 00:10:26.248
In the next video, I'll
show you what this means

00:10:26.248 --> 00:10:27.862
in terms of graphs and slopes,

00:10:27.862 --> 00:10:30.788
but it's important to understand
that graphs and slopes

00:10:30.788 --> 00:10:33.226
are not the only way to
understand derivatives

00:10:33.226 --> 00:10:34.609
because as soon as you start thinking

00:10:34.609 --> 00:10:36.513
about dector valued functions

00:10:36.513 --> 00:10:39.717
or functions with inputs of
higher dimensions than just two,

00:10:39.717 --> 00:10:41.992
you can no longer think
in terms of graphs.

00:10:41.992 --> 00:10:44.350
But, this idea of nudging
the input in some direction,

00:10:44.350 --> 00:10:46.579
seeing how that influences the output,

00:10:46.579 --> 00:10:49.690
and then taking the ratio
of that output nudge

00:10:49.690 --> 00:10:50.587
to the input nudge,

00:10:50.587 --> 00:10:52.305
that's a more general
way of viewing things.

00:10:52.305 --> 00:10:54.477
And that's gonna be very
helpful moving forward

00:10:54.477 --> 00:10:55.310
in multi-variable cap.
