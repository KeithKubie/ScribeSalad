This video is sponsored by Next Games, creator of AMC's official game The Walking Dead:No Man's Land.

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.089
I put a link in the description so you can go download the game for free and it comes with a special offer!

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:10.900
I'll tell you about in a few minutes.

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:13.019
What's up guys welcome back for this video today,

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.759
I thought it'd be fun to take a little bit of an apocalyptic twist now if you're to find yourself in a survival

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:20.188
emergency or zombie apocalyptic situation,

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:26.039
One of the most valuable resources you could get your hands on would be clean drinking water you won't last very long without it

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:27.480
so for this video today,

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.769
I thought it'd be great to show you how to use resources you already have to make clean drinking water for yourself

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:45.880
So quick update guys. I just stepped outside for a second

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:48.970
I walked over to my fish pond which ironically doesn't have any fish in it

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:53.949
But it does have a massive amount of other kinds of life as you see here. We've got Mosquito larvae

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:56.139
We've got these little worms flopping around all over the place

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:01.059
We've got algae and all kinds of junk and other little parasites that probably will help very much in your quest for survival

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.629
But I am going to drink it once we make our filter and sterilize the water

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.280
We need a simple way to filter all this garbage out before we sterilize the water and to get started

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.030
We're going to be making a simple sand

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:12.020
Charcoal filter

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:17.080
now to get started making our sand charcoal filter of course we're going to need some sand we're getting some charcoal and we're going to

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.800
Need some kind of a plastic container like these simple little water bottles

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:20.780
You probably have lying around

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:25.629
Now because sand, clay and rocks have different densities if you put them in a container with water and stir it all up

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.619
The rocks will fall to the bottom first followed by the sand and the clay on top

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:34.839
any organic material left behind will float up with a surface where you can skim it off by using these layers of

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:40.869
Separation with one chunk of dirt you can end up with nice small pebbles very fine sand and the clay which we don't actually need

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:45.639
For this experiment. Or you could use something like a strainer and filter out the finer sand that way as well

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:51.159
So now that we've got our fine sand our small pebbles and a small water bottle the only thing left to do is crush up

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:53.159
some charcoal

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:57.309
Now for this experiment. I'm using the same charcoal I used for our black-Powder experiment

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:58.490
We made in the previous video

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.990
however

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:01.540
If you don't want to go to the trouble of making your own you can just look around a campfire

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:07.809
For those large chunks of black wood they're charred and snap in half when you press them if your charcoal is done

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:10.449
Right it should just about crumble if you apply any kind of pressure to it

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:14.290
Which is good because the finer we can get our charcoal the better our filter is going to work

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:18.129
now of course my charcoal is just a mixture of small twigs paint sticks and

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:19.190
sawdust

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:24.519
which I like to sawdust because it's already in fine powder form to begin with but whatever material you end up using to make your

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:27.609
Charcoal should be just fine because it all ends up is pretty much the same stuff

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:32.440
The goal is just to make it a very fine powder because the finer your charcoal is the better your filters can work

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:43.310
that's beautiful

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:46.480
Here we are guys we have all of our filter materials prepped and ready for assembly

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:51.580
So let's take our plastic water bottle cut off the bottom and put a little bit of paper towel on the bottom to catch everything

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:54.520
As it falls in now, if you don't have any paper towel or fine cloth

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:55.660
You could use a bit of your shirt

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:59.919
You can use some sock any kind of cloth really that's going to stick down the bottom and hold the charcoal in place

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:03.249
Preventing it from slipping through so now that we have our paper towel in place

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.330
We can go ahead and start adding the filter materials fineness to courses so in this case

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.510
We're going to start with the very fine charcoal powder and build that up a few inches deep

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:15.819
Followed by as much of the fine sand as we can pack in there, and then a nice top layer of small pebbles

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:20.200
And that's really to protect the system from the water this splashing in and just to go one step further

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:25.029
I took the bottom of the bottle and cut it into a makeshift baffle to stick it on the top and help reduce erosion

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:27.190
As we pour the water in now

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:32.079
This is a very basic style filter and the more material you could add the better it will work and you could also get creative

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:35.830
With some different variations for example you could layer the charcoal and the sand

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:41.650
Charcoal, sand as many times as you want or you can even just cut the water bottle in half, use the top part of it

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:44.379
To form the filter and use the bottom part to form the cup

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:49.869
The time has come to take our scummy pond water and test our filters to keep it work now if you look at the water

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:51.870
Itself this has been sitting out for about 45 minutes

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:56.469
and you can see that already a lot of the material in there has settled down to the bottom and

00:03:56.570 --> 00:04:00.939
Relatively filtered itself through gravity we've got organic material and bugs floating at the top

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:06.159
But the water is a lot clearer than it used to be so step number one in filtering your water if you can

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:10.329
Let your water sit out for a few hours. So most of the material can settle down to the bottom first

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:32.800
So I've just made the transfer you can already see that this water is so much cleaner than this water here

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:35.949
There's still little bugs floating around there and a lot of other nasties

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:40.240
But we can now take this water and pour it into our filter and cleanse it even further watch this

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:01.319
So our water filters are charged and is going to take a little bit of time for the water to filter through

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:06.959
So while we're waiting for that let me show you a fun way you can brush up on those crucial survival strategies for surviving that

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:12.120
Inevitable zombie outbreak I put a link down in the description to download The Walking Dead No Man's Land.

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:15.179
It's a free game with a special offer. That's only available right now

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:18.750
now if you're the kind of person that likes playing checkers chess or turn-By-turn

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:22.079
Strategy type games this might be a good choice for you

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:25.470
You actually use the characters you know from the television show The Walking Dead

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:31.409
In the actual Walking Dead Locations like the terminus in the prison when I was doing a road trip down to La with my friend

00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:35.399
Mark a few weeks ago. I actually spent six hours straight playing this game, so I made it pretty far

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:41.130
So you take turns moving people around and every time you move then the zombies get a chance to move as well you have to

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:46.079
use a little bit strategy you have to do some tactical maneuvers you have to think your way through it because if you make the

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:51.659
Wrong move all of your hard work can go down the drain the more cleverly you can position your people the better your chances at

00:05:51.659 --> 00:05:52.530
Winning it's a lot of fun

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:58.169
And there's some back-end strategy going on as well because not only are you defeating the zombies and rescuing humanity, you also get to play

00:05:58.169 --> 00:06:03.689
Around with developing an encampment you start out with and you can choose how to set it up to build up your colony and fortify

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:08.009
It if you're a fan of the TV show The Walking Dead you're going to recognise characters like Daryl Rick

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:11.969
Michonne and Negan which by the way if you download the game right now

00:06:11.969 --> 00:06:13.810
You'll get the character Negan for free

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:17.159
It would actually be really cool if they could make a King of Random character.

00:06:17.229 --> 00:06:20.609
The game is available on IOS, Android and pretty much any other device

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:21.659
so if you like zombies

00:06:21.659 --> 00:06:25.589
And you want to rescue humanity hang out with characters you know and slaughter hordes of the undead?

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:30.930
Go down to the first link of the description download the game for free the offer is only available right now

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:34.860
All right back to the experiment

00:06:41.139 --> 00:06:47.459
Alright guys. We are back. We've been running these filters for about 45 minutes now to the point where the cups are actually overflowing

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:51.630
So let's stop for a second and observe the different results between the different filters

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.509
So just by looking at the different colors of the water here

00:06:54.509 --> 00:06:59.309
It looks like the one on your right is actually the clearest and this is the one that we built in this video

00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:04.109
It's got the layer of charcoal on the slot on the stand in the middle of the pebbles on the top and is this pretty

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:06.960
basic Design now look if we screw the cap on

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:12.060
We can actually contain everything inside and just set that off to the side to be used again at another time

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:16.979
You know what else is really crazy is if you look at the top of the filter you can actually see like the little worms

00:07:16.979 --> 00:07:22.348
The Larva the bugs like jumping around and floating on top. They don't make it past the rocks though

00:07:22.349 --> 00:07:25.079
They just stay on the top the water we collected at the bottom is

00:07:25.419 --> 00:07:28.619
Definitely different than the water on the top now the one in the middle

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:32.459
I'm a little bit surprised about because we actually had two different layers of Charcoal

00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:37.289
And I would have expected that to be the clearest out of all of them now what I think happened is when I was building

00:07:37.289 --> 00:07:37.590
this one

00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:41.759
I actually ran out of my really fine charcoal, and I just started putting the chunky charcoal instead

00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:42.430
so

00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:42.930
obviously

00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:49.799
It didn't filter the water quite as good as the really fine charcoal does this shows the finer your charcoal the clearer your water is

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:52.770
Actually going to be let's take a look down inside and check it for clarity

00:07:53.199 --> 00:07:56.098
So I've just transferred our two large samples to two glasses.

00:07:56.099 --> 00:08:01.439
We can look inside and check for clarity and you see the one on the left has slightly yellow tinge to it the one on

00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:03.570
The right that looks absolutely fantastic and if you look down here

00:08:03.570 --> 00:08:08.789
You look straight through the glass you can't see any particulate floating around whatsoever

00:08:09.190 --> 00:08:12.959
This water right here looks beautiful looks refreshing. It looks crystal clear

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:18.060
It looks delicious in a survival situation, it's going to be the nectar of life however

00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:21.449
There's one thing left to do before you drink it and that's to sterilize it

00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:38.739
Alright guys. I am back with my sterilized water. I just stuck this in the microwave for 4 minutes however

00:08:38.810 --> 00:08:45.010
There are a lot of alternative methods you could use for purifying water as well such as water purification tablets, UV stir sticks

00:08:45.010 --> 00:08:50.919
And I've even heard of people sticking water in clear plastic bottles and setting them out in sunlight for 24 to 48 hours

00:08:51.050 --> 00:08:54.609
But for simplicity on this project I went ahead and use the boiling water method

00:08:54.610 --> 00:08:58.240
That's the method that's most commonly used and after you boil water for a couple of minutes

00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:03.010
It's pretty much enough to kill anything in the water that could hurt you so they say so here. We are guys

00:09:03.010 --> 00:09:07.210
This is the moment of truth. We've got our green scummy pond water that we have transformed into

00:09:07.730 --> 00:09:09.560
sterilized charcoaled filtered water

00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:16.359
It's filtered sanitized life-giving zero-Calorie sugar-free gluten-free dairy-free and ready to drink so this is it

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:20.620
I'm actually so confident. This is sterilized and ready to drink. I'm just going to down the whole thing here we go

00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:31.120
Bangarang. That was actually really good that tastes

00:09:32.450 --> 00:09:38.470
Probably a lot different than this taste. I mean look mosquito Larvae are still having a heyday in there

00:09:39.350 --> 00:09:46.479
So in a survival situation I choose our charcoal filter water which is made out of materials from the backyard Dirt, sand

00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:50.979
Charcoal and look how crystal-clear that comes out this is a viable option guys

00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:54.130
This is how you survive because water is one of the essentials

00:09:54.290 --> 00:10:01.029
So there you have a guys that's one cool trick to taking ugly disgusting contaminated water and turning it into sanitized, purified

00:10:01.490 --> 00:10:05.020
Totally drinkable water it might just save your life now

00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:06.670
You guys know I post videos every single day

00:10:06.670 --> 00:10:09.610
So if you're really curious to know whether or not this was actually safe for me to drink

00:10:09.710 --> 00:10:14.499
click subscribe ring the bell to receive my future post notifications because if I stop posting

00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:16.610
Well, you'll know what happened

00:10:16.610 --> 00:10:20.950
Thanks for joining me for this project today if an emergency pops up I hope this might help save your life

00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:22.960
I'll see you in the next video talk to you then

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:24.960
I love charcoal.

00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:30.120
Just went into my lungs. Oh oh, oh

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:34.980
There they go spill it all over the place. You're not having a mess you're not making fun

00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:38.140
Hey guys quick reminder

00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:43.740
there's a link in the description right now to download The Walking Dead no man's land for free if you download before the end of

00:10:43.749 --> 00:10:47.100
July you'll unlock the character, Negan go get em Boys!
