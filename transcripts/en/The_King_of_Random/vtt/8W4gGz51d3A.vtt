00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:04.100
For this project, I’m going to show you
how to drop the “Love Bomb”. These homemade

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:08.510
sticks of "pampered bliss" will instantly turn
any ordinary bath, into a rich and relaxing

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:12.850
day at the spa. They’re easy to make, they
smell incredible, and are the perfect way

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:15.890
to show your special someone, just how much
you care.

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:22.140
To start this project you’re going to need
a box of baking soda, a bag of Epsom salts,

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.910
cornstarch, and a little citric acid.

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:28.609
Citric Acid is the stuff on sour candy, that
makes your face pucker up when you eat them,

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:31.320
and it’s usually sold at health food stores,
by the ounce.

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.429
You can also find it at ethnic grocery stores,
or other specialty food stores, under the

00:00:35.429 --> 00:00:38.139
name of “citric acid”, or “sour salt”.

00:00:38.139 --> 00:00:41.579
Now we’re going to need some measuring cups
to get busy mixing, and manufacturing. And

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.210
while you’re at it, round up a descent sized
mixing bowl with a lid, as well.

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.160
Start by dumping in a quarter of a cup of baking
soda, an eighth of a cup of Epsom Salt, an

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.789
eighth of a cup of corn starch, and an eighth
of a cup of citric acid.

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:57.280
Now simply pop the lid on your container,
and shake it as hard as you can for around 15-20 seconds.

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.850
That’s all it takes to get an amazingly
intimate mix. But you might want to give it

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.309
a few seconds for the dust to settle, before
you take the lid off.

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:07.690
Alright the powder’s done, so let’s move
on to mixing the wet ingredients next, and

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:10.920
for that you’ll just need a little water,
some vegetable oil, food coloring, and your

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.400
choice of essential oils for fragrance. Those
are at the health food store as well.

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:19.050
Now vegetable oil works great for this recipe,
but if you want to score even more points

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:22.150
with your partner, try using castor oil instead.

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:26.430
Measure 1-1/2 teaspoons of vegetable, or caster
oil into a small container, followed by 1

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.840
full teaspoon of water. Then get the essential
oils you want for fragrance and relaxation,

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.240
and drip in around half a teaspoon. Which
will be anywhere between 20-40 drops.

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:40.520
Eucalyptus is my favorite because it smells
amazing and makes your skin tingle, but you don’t have to stop there.

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.850
Try taking your aromas to the next level by
mixing 15 drops of Eucalyptus, 5 drops of

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.060
Peppermint, and 20 drops of Lavender for an
even richer experience.

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.940
At this point you’ll have a full 3 teaspoons
of liquid, and the only thing left to add, is a bit of color.

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:58.180
I typically use between 12-15 drops of red
food coloring, then blend it all together

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:02.729
with something like a toothpick. 15 drops
of red is enough to turn your bath bombs pink,

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.940
without having to worry about staining your
skin, or your bathtub.

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:09.020
Now when we mix the liquid into the powder
it’s going to start fizzing a bit, and we

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.849
don’t really want that. So to minimize the
effect, try stirring the powder continuously

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:15.769
while slowly dribbling the oils in overtop.

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:19.069
Mix all the liquids into the powder until
you don’t see anymore fizzing, then simply

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:23.069
slap the lid back on, and give it another
20 seconds of vigorous shaking.

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:26.579
With that final step, our explosive “love
potion” is ready, and we can move on to

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:30.030
forming them into sticks, of bath bombing
bliss.

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:34.189
Cut a piece of string, or paracord, so it’s
around 7” long, then tie a simple knot at

00:02:34.189 --> 00:02:36.409
the bottom, as close to the end as you can
get it.

00:02:36.409 --> 00:02:40.150
If you want, you could also tie a little “secret
surprise” onto the string, and have it pop

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.790
out in the bath once everything dissolves.

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:46.340
Now we need a way to mold the material into
sticks, and for that I’m using a piece of

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.100
PVC tubing 1-1/2” wide and 3-1/2” tall.

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:54.760
If you don’t have any PVC, don’t worry.
You can always use a toilet paper roll instead.

00:02:54.779 --> 00:02:58.219
Cut a strip of paper so it’s just wider
than the tube is tall, then roll it up and

00:02:58.219 --> 00:03:03.619
push it down into the center. And when you
let go, it should expand and fill the inside of the tube completely.

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:07.529
Now hold the tube upright on a hard surface,
and carefully spoon the pinkish compound into

00:03:07.529 --> 00:03:09.739
the center, one scoop at a time.

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:13.590
As it gets near the top you’ll need to press
the mixture back down to the bottom, compacting

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:17.219
it firmly together, with something blunt,
like the butt of a hammer.

00:03:17.219 --> 00:03:20.540
Fill the tube back up to the top again, but
before you pack it down this time, poke a

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:24.040
small hole in the center, and shove the string
halfway down inside.

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:27.669
Gently ram the mix slowly and carefully on
either side of the string, to help secure

00:03:27.669 --> 00:03:31.159
the rope in place, then press the other edges
down after that.

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:34.150
This recipe will give you just enough ramming
powder to fill the tube all the way to the

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:37.549
top and when it’s packed down as hard as
you can get it, carefully move the container

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:42.460
to the freezer and let it sit for around 10-15
minutes, to help it firm up a little bit more.

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:45.840
While we’re waiting on that, let’s round
up a pair of scissors, a stick of glue, and

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:50.290
these fizzy “Bath Bomb Labels” I made,
which you can find for free, in the description.

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:53.959
Download, and print off a copy for yourself,
and cut out the one that best meets your needs.

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:56.999
Or use them as a template to make one of your
own.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.520
Alright it’s been about 10 minutes, and
you can see how tightly compacted our “Bath

00:04:00.529 --> 00:04:06.089
Bomb” is from all that ramming, so all it
takes to extract it, is some firm and constant pressure at the bottom.

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:09.680
The end of the hammer works great for leverage,
and you should find your package pops out

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:12.219
cleanly, and hopefully, all in one piece.

00:04:12.219 --> 00:04:16.010
Now go ahead and remove the paper to reveal
your creation, and just like that you’ve

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:18.750
got a cool little Bath Bomb, ready for use.

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:22.200
To make it a touch more professional, let’s
quickly add a bit of glue to the bottom tab

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:25.450
on our label and carefully wrap it around
the side of the stick.

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:29.220
With the edges lined up, and the tabs pressed
together firmly, our “Love Bomb” is packed

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:32.040
with passion, and ready to explode.

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:35.000
These little “Bath Bombs” are so quick
and easy to make, you may as well spend a

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.780
little extra time manufacturing a few more.

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:43.740
I made this “special” version for my wife,
and it’s packed with a little surprise inside, for her to find later on.

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:47.760
“Bath Bombs” are great gifts, and are
designed to instantly turn any ordinary bath,

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:51.360
into a rich and luxurious experience, for
your special someone.

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:55.460
They’re made with love, and the coolest
thing, is they do all the romantic work for you.

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:59.440
Simply toss one into a tub full of water,
and it erupts on contact. Instantly infusing

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:02.910
the bath with color, fragrance, and relaxation.

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:06.880
It energetically bubbles and fizzes away,
because the citric acid reacts with the baking

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:10.200
soda, to rapidly release carbon dioxide gas.

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:13.580
When the fizzling finally settles down after
about a minute, there will be billions of

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:17.800
tiny little droplets left glimmering and sparkling
on the surface of the water, and for a moment

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:24.320
in time your love will find herself in a blissful
utopia, feeling relaxed, rejuvenated, and appreciated.

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:27.940
And if there’s something hidden inside,
like perhaps a small piece of jewelry, it’ll

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:31.860
give her one final surprise, right when she
least expects it.

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:35.080
Well now you know how to use simple and common
ingredients from around the house, to make

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:38.560
a rich and luxurious “Bath Bomb”, for
the love of your life.

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:42.860
By the way, if you don’t want your Bath
Bombs to be pink, simply make them a different color instead.

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:46.960
I made a blue batch and used a novelty ice
cub mold, to make an exploding “Death Star”

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:51.660
for my kids. Which for some reason, suddenly
makes bath time the coolest thing to do.

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:55.180
Well that’s it for now. If you liked this
project, perhaps you’ll like some of my others.
