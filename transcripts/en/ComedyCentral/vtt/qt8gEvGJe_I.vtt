00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:34.033 line:91%
THIS BEING A NATIONAL ELECTION
THE UK MEDIA WAS PULLING OUT ALL

00:00:34.066 --> 00:00:37.370 align:start position:0% line:91%
THE STOPS, THEY HAD THEIR CREEPY
MADAME TUSSAUD VOTE

00:00:37.403 --> 00:00:40.773 align:start position:0% line:91%
TALLY HOLOGRAMS, THEY HAD AN
UNREALISTICALLY POLITE

00:00:40.806 --> 00:00:44.077 align:start position:0% line:91%
VIRTUAL PARLIAMENT THAT
DOUBLED AS THE  WORST SIM'S

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:47.580 align:start position:0% line:91%
EXPANSION PACK EVER AND THEY HAD

SUDOKU, HE IS JUST BORED OUT OF

00:00:54.453 --> 00:00:55.654 align:start position:0% line:85%
HIS MIND.

00:00:55.688 --> 00:00:59.058 line:91%
I JUST REALIZED, THE HOLOGRAMS,
THE VIRTUAL SETS, THE BRITISH

00:00:59.091 --> 00:01:01.394 align:start position:0% line:91%
MEDIA HAS CONTRACTED A
DEVASTATING CASE OF

00:01:01.427 --> 00:01:02.562 align:start position:0% line:85%
CNNITIS.

00:01:02.595 --> 00:01:04.964 line:91%
IT'S WHEN A NEWS ORGANIZATION
SPENDS A GREAT DEAL OF TIME

00:01:04.997 --> 00:01:08.968 align:start position:0% line:91%
CREATING VISUALS AND SET PIECES
WHICH SERVE NO DISCERNIBLE

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.674 line:91%
DISTRACT YOU FROM WHAT IT WAS
THEY WERE TRYING TO FIND OUT.

00:01:14.707 --> 00:01:15.408 align:start position:0% line:91%
BUT YOU KNOW SOMETHING, NO ONE
CAN ACTUALLY CHALLENGE

00:01:15.441 --> 00:01:17.610 align:start position:0% line:85%
THE MASTER.

00:01:17.643 --> 00:01:21.981 size:88% position:44% line:91%

MEAN NOW FOR THAT REFERENDUM

00:01:28.454 --> 00:01:31.424 align:start position:0% line:91%
 FOR BRITAIN
LEAVING THE EU?

00:01:31.457 --> 00:01:35.661 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; ALISYN, I CAN DO BETTER
THAN THAT.

00:01:35.694 --> 00:01:38.831 align:start position:0% line:91%
HAVE A LOOK AT THAT, AS A
MILLION DOLLAR SHOT, LOOK AT

00:01:38.864 --> 00:01:44.704 size:75% position:38% line:91%
THAT, RIGHT UP THE RIVER
THAMES, THE LONDON EYE.

00:01:44.737 --> 00:01:47.640 line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon: CAMEROTA ASKED YOU A
REAL QUESTION, YOU POINTED TO A

00:01:47.673 --> 00:01:48.508 align:start position:0% line:85%
[BLEEP] FERRIS WHEEL.

00:01:48.541 --> 00:01:50.743 align:start position:0% line:91%
THAT IS WHAT A SIX-YEAR-OLD
DOES.

00:01:50.776 --> 00:01:56.015 align:start position:0% line:91%
I SEE A WHEEL, IT IS NICE,
IT SPINS AROUND.

00:01:56.048 --> 00:01:58.985 align:start position:0% line:91%
WELL, BRITAIN'S MEDIA
COULDN'T MATCH US WITH WIDE

00:01:59.018 --> 00:02:02.622 align:start position:0% line:91%
EYED NONSENSE THEY DID
COMPARE WITH US IN ONE

00:02:02.655 --> 00:02:03.389 align:start position:0% line:85%
ARENA.

00:02:03.423 --> 00:02:04.590 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; THE POLLS WERE COMPLETELY
WRONG.

00:02:04.623 --> 00:02:06.459 align:start position:0% line:91%
ALL THE ADVANCED POLLS
WERE VERY WRONG.

00:02:06.492 --> 00:02:09.428 size:78% position:39% line:91%
THE REAL SHOT CAME AT 10
P.M. LONDON TIME WHEN THE

00:02:09.461 --> 00:02:10.897 size:75% position:38% line:85%
EXIT POLL WAS ANNOUNCED.

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:14.100 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon: ISN'T THAT WHY WE HAVE
ELECTIONS?

00:02:14.133 --> 00:02:18.437 size:75% position:38% line:91%
TO TEST THE STRENGTH AND
COMPETENCE OF OUR POLLS?

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.274 align:start position:0% line:91%
THE REAL WINNER TONIGHT WAS
OUR POLLING SAFEGUARD

00:02:21.307 --> 00:02:22.074 align:start position:0% line:85%
SYSTEM.

00:02:22.107 --> 00:02:24.744 align:start position:0% line:85%
THE ELECTION.

00:02:24.777 --> 00:02:27.213 size:88% position:44% line:91%
SO DESPITE ALL PREDICTIONS,
CAMERON'S CONSERVATIVE SWEPT

00:02:27.246 --> 00:02:28.548 size:75% position:38% line:85%
TO AN OUTRIGHT MAJORITY.

00:02:28.581 --> 00:02:31.250 align:start position:0% line:91%
THEIR MESSAGE MUST HAVE
REALLY CLICKED WITH VOTERS.

00:02:31.283 --> 00:02:34.153 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; THE CONSERVATIVES CAN
ACTUALLY GOVERN THE WAY THEY

00:02:34.186 --> 00:02:34.820 align:start position:0% line:85%
WANT TO.

00:02:34.853 --> 00:02:36.222 size:81% position:41% line:85%
&gt;&gt; GET RID OF THE DEFICIT.

00:02:36.255 --> 00:02:39.325 size:88% position:44% line:91%
&gt;&gt; AUSTERITY MEASURES REALLY
HITTING THOSE LOWER ON THE

00:02:39.358 --> 00:02:40.192 align:start position:0% line:85%
ECONOMIC SCALE.

00:02:40.226 --> 00:02:42.895 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; VERY LARGE CUTS TO THE
WELFARE STATE.

00:02:42.928 --> 00:02:48.701 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; REPEAL TONY BLAIR'S BAN
ON HUNTING WITH DOGS.

00:02:48.734 --> 00:02:51.103 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon: WHAT A POPULAR
MESSAGE, A HEADY MIX OF

00:02:51.136 --> 00:02:54.974 align:start position:0% line:91%
GRINDING AUSTERITY AND THE
KILLING OF SMALL FURY

00:02:55.007 --> 00:02:58.911 align:start position:0% line:85%
ANIMALS.

00:02:58.944 --> 00:03:06.219 align:start position:0% line:91%
I ALMOST HATE TO SAY THIS
BUT LEAVE FOX ALONE.

00:03:06.252 --> 00:03:17.697 align:start position:0% line:91%
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
FOX NEVER HURT ANYBODY.

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:28.207 align:start position:0% line:91%
(LAUGHTER)
ANYWAY THOSE POLICIES SOUND

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:29.942 align:start position:0% line:91%
LIKE STUFF BRITISH PEOPLE
WOULD HATE.

00:03:29.975 --> 00:03:32.979 size:75% position:38% line:91%
HOW DOES LABOUR NOT WALK
AWAY WITH THIS ELECTION?

00:03:33.012 --> 00:03:37.083 size:84% position:42% line:91%
&gt;&gt; ED MILIBAND HAD PRETTY
DISMAL RATINGS WHEN IT CAME

00:03:37.116 --> 00:03:38.184 align:start position:0% line:85%
TO LEADERSHIP.

00:03:38.217 --> 00:03:40.987 align:start position:0% line:91%
THE VOTERS DIDN'T REALLY SEE
HIM AS PRIME MINISTERIAL.

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:42.154 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; 40% THOUGHT YOU WERE
WEIRD.

00:03:42.187 --> 00:03:46.425 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; THEY SEE YOU AS --

00:03:46.458 --> 00:03:50.129 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; WHAT DID YOU SAY?

00:03:50.162 --> 00:03:52.131 size:78% position:39% line:85%
PEOPLE I THINK THOUGHT --

00:03:52.164 --> 00:03:55.668 size:88% position:44% line:91%
&gt;&gt; THAT LADY IN THE BACK, IS
THAT A MAN, OH RIGHT, SORRY

00:03:55.701 --> 00:03:57.870 line:91%
ABOUT THAT, AND YOU'VE GOT A
BEARD SO YOU'RE CLEARLY A MAN,

00:03:57.903 --> 00:04:01.274 align:start position:0%
YEAH.

00:04:01.307 --> 00:04:02.408 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Jon: WHAT!

00:04:02.442 --> 00:04:05.711 size:88% position:44% line:91%
SO THE LABOUR LEADER APPEARS
TO BE THE LOVE CHILD OF JOE

00:04:05.744 --> 00:04:08.881 align:start position:0% line:91%
BIDEN AND DAVID BRENT -- SO
WHAT?

00:04:08.914 --> 00:04:11.150 align:start position:0% line:91%
STILL, THE ELECTION WAS
MILIBAND'S TO LOSE.

00:04:11.183 --> 00:04:15.688 align:start position:0% line:91%
I MEAN UNLESS THERE WAS SOME
UNUNFORTUNATE

00:04:15.721 --> 00:04:16.922 align:start position:0% line:91%
IMAGE CRYSTALLIZING
INCIDENT.

00:04:16.955 --> 00:04:19.892 align:start position:0% line:91%

00:04:22.261 --> 00:04:24.930 size:81% position:41% line:91%
DON'T EAT A BACON SANDWICH
IN FRONT OF THE CAMERAS.

00:04:24.963 --> 00:04:28.601 align:start position:0% line:91%
THE TORY SUPPORTING PRESS
JUMPED ON THE IMAGE,

00:04:28.634 --> 00:04:33.172 align:start position:0% line:91%
MILIBAND WAS NOT JUST A
FREE-SPENDING LABOURITE, HE

00:04:33.205 --> 00:04:34.707 align:start position:0% line:91%
JUST DIDN'T LOOK LIKE A
PRIME MINISTER.

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:36.609 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Jon: THAT'S IT?

00:04:36.642 --> 00:04:38.044 size:75% position:38% line:85%
HE ATE A BACON SANDWICH.

00:04:38.077 --> 00:04:40.646 size:81% position:41% line:91%
IN OUR COUNTRY YOU ARE NOT
EVEN CONSIDERED A VIABLE

00:04:40.679 --> 00:04:43.215 align:start position:0% line:91%
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE
UNTIL YOU HAVE BEEN

00:04:43.248 --> 00:04:46.919 size:88% position:44% line:91%
PHOTOGRAPHED DEEP THROATING

COMPLETELY BLOCK YOUR LARYNX.

00:04:50.222 --> 00:04:53.392 line:91%
IF THE BRITISH PRESS WENT ALL
IN ON ED'S LUNCH, I CAN'T EVEN

00:04:53.425 --> 00:04:57.396 size:84% position:42% line:91%
