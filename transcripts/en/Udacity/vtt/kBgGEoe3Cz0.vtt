00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.280
So we're going to go over and
build Bayes filter framework and

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:06.920
so given four things.

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:11.490
First is I'm going to need some prior
belief about where I'm starting okay, so

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:12.990
that's p of x.

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:14.390
Where did that come from again?

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:17.720
Remember that drive up to Delphi and
asking the Oracle and all that stuff.

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:20.570
So you forget your luggage so
you went back to Delphi.

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:24.600
You got another prior and it tells
you how things are starting, but

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.630
again, maybe with a large uncertainty.

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:29.660
So here we have our
dynamical system model.

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:34.120
And so it's the probability
of some new x given my belief

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:39.110
about the previous x plus this input.

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:43.093
By the way,
you see here it says u sub t minus 1?

00:00:43.093 --> 00:00:47.990
The, the, the world is sometimes
schizophrenic about whether

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:53.080
you think of the input as happening
just after the last measurement,

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:57.550
so it was u at t minus 1 or
u happen now and

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:00.330
I want to estimate
what the state is now.

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:03.470
So, whether it's ut or
ut minus 1, it's whatever

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:09.880
u you're going to add onto xt minus 1 in
order to make your prediction about xt.

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:10.710
All right?

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.040
So, we're given these two things.

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.040
We're given a prior, an action model.

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.465
We're also given a sensor model.

00:01:17.465 --> 00:01:19.410
And this is going to
be really important,

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:23.260
a little bit important this lesson,
very important next lesson.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:27.470
And the sensor model is our likelihood,
okay?

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:31.350
And it is not,
I'll tell you what it isn't, first.

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.150
It is not, given some sensor reading,
reading, where do I think the object is?

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.270
You might think that's what it is, but
then you would be thinking incorrectly.

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:43.720
No, a likelihood model is

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:51.320
if the object were really someplace,
what's the likelihood of my measurement?

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.565
So normally what you'll see is and we're
going to see some later like a little

00:01:54.565 --> 00:01:58.770
Gaussian blob drawn over the place
where the measurement was.

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.380
That does not mean, okay,
that given this measurement,

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.690
this is my distribution
of where things are.

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:06.800
No, no, no.

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:10.729
What it means is,
this is my likelihood, so

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:15.820
it's highest if x was actually at this
point, and then it falls off slowly.

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:16.420
All right.

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:17.890
That's the likelihood.

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:21.670
And then finally,
we're given the stream of observations.

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.090
The z, so z1 through zt minus 1,
or through zt.

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:31.220
And also, we know the actions, okay?

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:37.310
So we know the action data u,
u1 through u t minus 1, okay?

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:40.370
So those are the four
things that we have.

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:41.380
All right?

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:42.250
What do we want?

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:47.820
Well what we want is
the estimate of x at time t.

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:49.160
Okay?
Same thing we've always wanted

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:50.230
since we were little children.

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:55.040
And in the Bayesian world,
this is called the belief for

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.360
the posterior of this state.

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:58.530
Right?
And so sometimes it's even

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:59.270
written like this.

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:01.350
Bel for belief of xt.

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:03.355
What's my belief about xt?

00:03:03.355 --> 00:03:06.350
Given everything that I've observed so

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:09.980
far, knowing all their prohibitions and
given my current measurement.
