00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:03.925
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Thank you Andy, I am going the other way as the testing is about to begin.

00:00:03.925 --> 00:00:10.568
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Alright contestants, you know the rules. Place the appropriate cup on the paper

00:00:10.568 --> 00:00:15.961
in the right place with the appropriate category. Ready, go.

00:00:15.961 --> 00:00:25.486
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; This is really exciting. Wow Andy you're right look at Alex tasting all those

00:00:25.486 --> 00:00:28.295
samples. This is just amazing.

00:00:28.295 --> 00:00:33.465
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; It really is amazing Lauren but you know you can't actually see her tasting.

00:00:33.465 --> 00:00:37.371
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I know Andy but it's just the thought of all those taste buds being activated

00:00:37.371 --> 00:00:40.967
and how fast she's processing all of these flavors it's just it's just

00:00:40.967 --> 00:00:43.725
incredible.

00:00:43.725 --> 00:00:47.450
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; You're right, and look at that. It looks like we have a winner. I, well, the

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:49.010
ref is checking the responses now.

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:50.054
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; We have a winner!
