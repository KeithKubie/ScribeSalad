00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.680
Now that our code is inside a function,

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:05.720
it has to be called, otherwise it won't work.

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:09.040
So let's invoke our code right after we define it.

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:13.210
Now first I'm going to give myself a little bit more space here so

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:19.700
you can see what I'm writing, and if we call display work and save it and

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:24.920
refresh the page, we can see that our work experience appears right here.

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:29.310
&gt;&gt; Hm, so, James, when you wrote display work, you didn't put an argument in,

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:30.790
you didn't pass in a parameter.

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:33.060
That's pretty interesting, why didn't we have to use one?

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:37.060
&gt;&gt; Well, this function is using an object that's in the global scope for

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:40.880
the script, meaning it's accessible to the function which is also in

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:41.960
the global scope.

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:43.900
&gt;&gt; True, but let's imagine that we wanted to,

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:47.930
I don't know, for some reason, add multiple different work sessions to the page.

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:49.780
Then, what would be need to do?

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:51.860
&gt;&gt; That sounds like a job for an argument.

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:56.020
If this function took in an argument, we could pass it different work objects,

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:58.170
which would each get displayed on the page.

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.060
&gt;&gt; You think we should do that?

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:03.960
&gt;&gt; I'm having a hard time imagining, why you want to do that for this example.

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.180
I have a better idea.

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.680
let's say you wanted to track where users are clicking on your site.

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.820
We could collect the cursor location every time a user clicks on the page and

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:15.100
send that off to our analytics site.

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:16.729
&gt;&gt; Interesting, let's see how that works.
