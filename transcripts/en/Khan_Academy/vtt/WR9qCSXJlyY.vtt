00:00:00.762 --> 00:00:03.839
Let's think about how we can define "Matrix Addition."

00:00:03.839 --> 00:00:06.609
And mathematicians could have chosen any

00:00:06.609 --> 00:00:09.406
of an arbitrary number of ways to define addition.

00:00:09.406 --> 00:00:11.691
But they've picked a way to define addition

00:00:11.691 --> 00:00:13.269
that seems – one – to make sense,

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:16.280
and it also has nice properties that allow us to do

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:19.049
interesting things with matrices later on.

00:00:19.049 --> 00:00:20.719
So if you were one of these mathematicians

00:00:20.719 --> 00:00:23.409
who were first defining how matrices should be added,

00:00:23.409 --> 00:00:24.425
how would you define

00:00:24.425 --> 00:00:27.543
adding this first matrix over here to the second one?

00:00:29.389 --> 00:00:31.418
Well, the most common-sense thing

00:00:31.418 --> 00:00:32.724
that might have jumped out at you –

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:34.023
especially because these two matrices

00:00:34.023 --> 00:00:35.152
have the same dimensions –

00:00:35.152 --> 00:00:36.589
(This is a 2-by-3 matrix.

00:00:36.589 --> 00:00:38.170
It has 2 rows and 3 columns.

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:39.840
This is also a 2-by-3 matrix.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.275
It also has 2 rows and 3 columns.)

00:00:41.275 --> 00:00:44.010
– is to just add the corresponding entries.

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.270
And if that was your intuition,

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:47.668
then you had the same intuition

00:00:47.668 --> 00:00:50.205
as the mathematical mainstream.

00:00:50.205 --> 00:00:51.835
That the addition of matrices

00:00:51.835 --> 00:00:53.102
should literally just be

00:00:53.102 --> 00:00:55.009
adding the corresponding entries.

00:00:55.009 --> 00:00:58.384
So in this situation, we would add 1 + 5

00:00:58.384 --> 00:01:00.224
to get the corresponding entry in the sum –

00:01:00.224 --> 00:01:01.205
which is 6.

00:01:01.205 --> 00:01:04.941
You can add negative seven plus zero

00:01:04.941 --> 00:01:06.836
to get negative seven.

00:01:06.836 --> 00:01:12.940
You can add five plus three to get eight.

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:15.088
You can add

00:01:15.088 --> 00:01:16.500
-and I'm running out of colours here-

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.921
you could add zero plus eleven

00:01:19.921 --> 00:01:21.532
to get eleven.

00:01:21.871 --> 00:01:25.210
You can add three to negative one

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:26.486
to get two.

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:30.404
And you could add -and you could add

00:01:30.404 --> 00:01:32.755
negative ten plus seven

00:01:32.755 --> 00:01:34.926
to get negative three.

00:01:34.926 --> 00:01:37.271
And if you see this definition of matrix addition

00:01:37.271 --> 00:01:39.004
you see that it actually does not matter

00:01:39.004 --> 00:01:41.877
in what order that we actually add these matrices.

00:01:41.877 --> 00:01:43.538
I could've done this the other way around,

00:01:43.538 --> 00:01:45.404
if I did this the other way around

00:01:45.404 --> 00:01:46.588
-so let me copy and paste this-

00:01:46.588 --> 00:01:47.936
so if I were to add this matrix

00:01:47.936 --> 00:01:51.344
-so let me copy, let me paste it-

00:01:51.344 --> 00:01:53.418
if I were to add that matrix to

00:01:53.418 --> 00:01:54.606
-let me copy and paste the other one-

00:01:54.606 --> 00:02:02.085
this matrix, copy and paste,

00:02:02.085 --> 00:02:04.512
you'll see that the order

00:02:04.512 --> 00:02:07.418
in which I'm adding the matrices does not matter

00:02:07.418 --> 00:02:09.004
So this is just like adding numbers.

00:02:09.004 --> 00:02:10.272
A plus B is just the same thing

00:02:10.272 --> 00:02:11.272
as B plus A.

00:02:11.272 --> 00:02:13.200
What we'll see is this won't be true

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.203
for every matrix operation that we study

00:02:15.203 --> 00:02:16.802
and in particular this will not be true

00:02:16.802 --> 00:02:18.355
for matrix multiplication.

00:02:18.355 --> 00:02:20.010
But if you add these two things,

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.092
using the definition we just came up with,

00:02:22.092 --> 00:02:23.417
adding corresponding terms,

00:02:23.417 --> 00:02:25.466
you'll get the exact same result.

00:02:25.466 --> 00:02:27.509
Up here we added one plus five and we got six

00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:30.346
Her we'll add five plus one and we'll get six.

00:02:30.346 --> 00:02:31.405
We get the same result

00:02:31.405 --> 00:02:34.168
because one plus five is the same thing as five plus one.

00:02:34.168 --> 00:02:35.602
Here we have zero plus negative seven

00:02:35.602 --> 00:02:37.260
you get negative seven.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.090
So you're going to get the exact same thing

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.535
as we got up here.

00:02:41.535 --> 00:02:43.938
So when you're adding matrices, if you were to call

00:02:43.938 --> 00:02:46.936
-if you were to call this matrix right over here matrix A

00:02:46.936 --> 00:02:49.133
which we normally denote with a capital, bolder letter,

00:02:49.133 --> 00:02:52.670
and you call this matrix right over here Matrix B

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:55.546
Then when we take the sum of A plus B

00:02:55.546 --> 00:02:57.206
which is this thing right over here,

00:02:57.206 --> 00:02:58.675
and we see it's the exact same thing

00:02:58.675 --> 00:03:05.123
as B, as Matrix B plus Matrix A.

00:03:05.123 --> 00:03:08.542
Now let me ask you an interesting question.

00:03:08.542 --> 00:03:10.539
What if I wanted to subtract matrices?

00:03:10.539 --> 00:03:12.923
So let's once again think about matrices

00:03:12.923 --> 00:03:14.868
that have the same dimensions.

00:03:14.868 --> 00:03:19.425
So let's say I'm gonna do then two two-by-two matrices.

00:03:19.425 --> 00:03:22.810
So let's say it's zero, one, three, two,

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:25.605
and from that I want to subtract

00:03:25.605 --> 00:03:31.270
negative one, three, zero, and five.

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:32.927
So you might say well maybe

00:03:32.927 --> 00:03:34.745
we just subtract corresponding entries.

00:03:34.745 --> 00:03:36.422
And that indeed is how you can define

00:03:36.422 --> 00:03:38.172
matrix subtraction.

00:03:38.172 --> 00:03:39.942
In fact you don't even have to define matrix subtraction,

00:03:39.942 --> 00:03:41.670
you can let this fall out of

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:44.179
what we did with scalar multiplication

00:03:44.179 --> 00:03:45.603
and matrix addition.

00:03:45.603 --> 00:03:47.756
We can view as the exact same thing

00:03:47.756 --> 00:03:48.758
-this as the exact same thing-

00:03:48.758 --> 00:03:50.670
as taking zero, one, three, two

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:54.761
and to that we add negative one, negative one times

00:03:54.761 --> 00:03:58.603
negative one, three, zero, five.

00:03:58.603 --> 00:04:01.088
And if you work out the math you're going to get

00:04:01.088 --> 00:04:02.511
the exact same result as just

00:04:02.511 --> 00:04:04.809
subtracting the corresponding terms.

00:04:04.809 --> 00:04:06.337
So this is going to be

00:04:06.737 --> 00:04:08.761
-what is this going to be?

00:04:08.761 --> 00:04:11.663
Zero minus negative one is positive one,

00:04:11.832 --> 00:04:14.473
one minus three is negative two,

00:04:14.473 --> 00:04:16.799
three minus zero is three,

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:19.844
two minus five is negative three.

00:04:20.137 --> 00:04:21.133
And you'll see that you get

00:04:21.133 --> 00:04:22.347
the exact same thing here.

00:04:22.347 --> 00:04:24.468
When you multiply negative one times negative one

00:04:24.468 --> 00:04:27.273
you get positive one, positive one plus zero is one.

00:04:27.273 --> 00:04:32.073
Negative one times three plus one is negative two.

00:04:32.195 --> 00:04:33.468
Fair enough.

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:34.874
There might be a question

00:04:34.874 --> 00:04:36.273
that is lingering in your brain right now.

00:04:36.273 --> 00:04:37.422
"Okay Sal, I understand

00:04:37.422 --> 00:04:39.175
when I'm adding or subtracting matrices

00:04:39.175 --> 00:04:40.673
with the same dimensions

00:04:40.673 --> 00:04:43.092
I just add or subtract the corresponding terms.

00:04:43.092 --> 00:04:45.070
But what happens when I have

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:47.205
matrices with different dimensions?"

00:04:47.205 --> 00:04:49.093
So, for example, what about

00:04:49.093 --> 00:04:52.022
the scenario where I want to add the matrix

00:04:52.022 --> 00:04:58.837
one, zero, three, five, zero, one to the matrix

00:04:58.837 --> 00:05:01.009
-so this a three-by-two matrix-

00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:05.424
and I wanna add it to, let's say, a two-by-two matrix.

00:05:05.424 --> 00:05:08.735
Five, seven, negative one, zero.

00:05:08.735 --> 00:05:12.344
What would we define this as?

00:05:12.344 --> 00:05:13.542
Well it turns out that

00:05:13.603 --> 00:05:16.133
the mathematical mainstream does not define this.

00:05:16.133 --> 00:05:17.857
This is undefined.

00:05:18.088 --> 00:05:20.604
This is undefined.

00:05:20.604 --> 00:05:22.601
So we do not define matrix addition,

00:05:22.601 --> 00:05:24.091
or matrix subtraction,

00:05:24.091 --> 00:05:27.342
when the matrices have different dimensions.

00:05:27.342 --> 00:05:29.341
There didn't seem to be any reasonable way to do this,

00:05:29.341 --> 00:05:31.090
that would actually be useful

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:33.469
and logically consistent in some nice way.
