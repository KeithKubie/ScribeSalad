00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
After this brief diversion, let's get back to

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
the actual deduction process.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
When you are reasoning what could have happened in a program,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
we again see the program execution as a succession of states.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
And then we reason backwards from what we

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
observe to what could have happened beforehand.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
This reasoning, this backwards reasoning

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
is actually structured along the ways that earlier

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
events in the program could have influenced later events.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
The most important concept when

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
reasoning backwards is called data dependency.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
The idea is as follows:

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
We do have 2 statements, say A and B in the program,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
and now A writes a variable,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
which is later read by B.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
In our example up here, A may have written this variable,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
and this will then be read by B.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Then we say that these 2 statements are data dependent on each other.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
B is data dependent on A

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
because there is a flow of data

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
from the statement A to the statement B.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
This concept of data dependency allows us

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
to trace back the possible locations in the state

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
as well as the statements that cause them

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
back within the program execution and therefore

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
to isolate the possible causes for an infection

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
and later the failure.
