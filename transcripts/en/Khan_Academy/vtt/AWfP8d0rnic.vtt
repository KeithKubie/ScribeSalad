00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:07.100
Given a rectangle with length a
squared plus 6a minus 27 and

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:12.030
width a squared minus 9, write
the ratio of the width of the

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.440
rectangle to its length as
a simplified rational

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:17.470
expression.

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:20.150
A rational expression is kind
of a fancy word essentially

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:23.480
for a fraction or as a ratio.

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:28.540
They want to us to express the
ratio of the length, so we'll

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:34.390
put the length in the numerator,
to the width.

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:38.285
In the problem, they tell us
that the length right here is

00:00:38.285 --> 00:00:48.870
a squared plus 6a minus 27 and
then the width they tell us

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.670
right here is a squared
minus 9.

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.280
So we've already expressed it as
a rational expression, but

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.710
this isn't necessarily
a simplified rational

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:02.680
expression.

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:06.200
Whenever you have any rational
expression-- let me just go

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.950
back to what you learned
a long time ago.

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.520
If I had something like 2/6,
that's a rational expression,

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.380
or that's also a fraction, but
this isn't in the most

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:16.480
simplified form.

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:18.420
What you could do is factor
both of these.

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.310
If you do a prime factorization,
it's just 2,

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.920
but 6 is 2 times 3.

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.280
When you factor them, you see
that you have the same factor

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.140
in the numerator and the
denominator, you can cancel

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.370
them out, and you can
simplify it to 1/3.

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:36.200
We're going to do the exact
same thing with these

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.590
algebraic expressions.

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.360
We can factor them and then see
if they have any of the

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.720
same terms. If they have the
same terms in the numerator

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.520
and the denominator, then we can
cancel them out, and then

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.980
we'll just be left with
whatever's left over.

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:51.650
Let's see if we can factor this
numerator right here.

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:56.170
This is going to be equal to--
let me draw the line there.

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:58.550
a squared plus 6a minus 27.

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:02.340
Can we think of two numbers that
if we multiply them, we

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.330
get negative 27?

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:06.740
They're going to have to be of
different signs, because when

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:08.350
you multiply them, you get a
negative number, and when you

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:11.050
add them, you get positive 6.

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:15.080
Let's see, 9 minus 3 is 6.

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:22.420
9 times negative 3 is negative
27, so this top expression is

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:27.790
a plus 9 times a minus 3.

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.280
We factored it there.

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.840
What does this bottom expression
factor into?

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.560
This is that standard form, if
you remember, a squared minus

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.785
b squared, where in this
case, b would be 3.

00:02:38.785 --> 00:02:40.330
b squared would be 9.

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:45.380
We know that this is equal to
a plus b times a minus b.

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.980
In this situation, we know this
is a special form that

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:55.930
would be factored into a
plus 3 times a minus 3.

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:59.360
We see there is a term that is
common to both the numerator

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.740
and the denominator:
a minus 3.

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:04.300
You have a minus 3 in the
numerator and you have an a

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:06.850
minus 3 in the denominator.

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:11.100
So we can divide the numerator
and the denominator by a minus

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:12.530
3, or that they would
cancel out.

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:16.630
a minus 3 divided by a minus
3, assuming that a is not

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:18.850
equal to 3, because then it
would become undefined, but if

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:22.360
we assume a does not equal to 3,
something divided by itself

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:24.990
will just be 1.

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:32.910
Then we'll just be left with
a plus 9 over a plus 3, and

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:36.310
that's about as simplified as
we can get for this rational

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:37.560
expression.
