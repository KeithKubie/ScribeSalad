00:00:06.692 --> 00:00:08.650
TIMOTHY JORDON: Hello,
and welcome to I/O live.

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:10.358
I'm Timothy Jordan,
and I'm standing here

00:00:10.358 --> 00:00:12.879
with Jeff Dean, the
head of AI at Google.

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:13.670
JEFF DEAN: Hi, Tim.

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:14.219
Thanks.

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:15.260
TIMOTHY JORDON: Hi, Jeff.

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.840
All right, let's start with
a background of Google's work

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:18.710
in AI.

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:20.668
JEFF DEAN: So we've been
using machine learning

00:00:20.668 --> 00:00:23.424
and AI for the last 20 years
in some of our products.

00:00:23.424 --> 00:00:24.840
But in the last
five or six years,

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.960
we've really sort
of dramatically

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.900
accelerated our use of
machine learning and AI

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:31.400
into more and more
of our products.

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.858
We've really used it to make
our products more intelligent,

00:00:33.858 --> 00:00:35.760
to make them sort
of more accessible,

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.344
to really improve the
product, and build products

00:00:38.344 --> 00:00:40.010
that we couldn't build
in any other way.

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:42.500
TIMOTHY JORDON: What's
new with the technology

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.500
that we're making available,
say the last year, and at I/O?

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.450
JEFF DEAN: In the last
year, for example,

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:49.730
we've made really great
strides in improving

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:52.150
TensorFlow, our open source
machine learning system.

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:53.900
One of the things I'm
really excited about

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.500
is the TensorFlow.js
release, which essentially

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.470
allows TensorFlow programs
to be run in the browser,

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:03.920
just as normal web pages,
with sort of machine

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.640
learning embedded code in them.

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.150
And it's really easy
for people to create

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.880
really interesting new
machine learning applications.

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.790
And then people to run them,
by just loading up a web page.

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:15.310
It's pretty fantastic.

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:16.640
TIMOTHY JORDON: And TPUs?

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.220
JEFF DEAN: So we released--
announced the third version

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.880
of our TPU processor line,
custom machine learning

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.130
accelerators.

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:26.690
The TPU V3 is really,
really exciting.

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:29.180
It's quite hot,
so it actually is

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:30.920
our first liquid
cooled processor

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.640
that's in our data center.

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.886
And the pods are actually
larger scale than the TPU pods

00:01:36.886 --> 00:01:38.510
that we announced
last year, so they're

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:39.600
eight times as powerful.

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.340
More than 100
petaflops of compute,

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.610
which is just an unbelievable
amount of compute.

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:45.890
And the really exciting
thing is that allows

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.610
us to make sort of more accurate
models, machine learning

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.699
models that can train
on more data, that

00:01:52.699 --> 00:01:54.740
can train more powerful
and more accurate models.

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:56.930
And then we can use that
to improve our products.

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:57.950
TIMOTHY JORDON: I think
one of the things that

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:59.700
makes me most excited
about the technology

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.044
that we're making available
is that whole spectrum, all

00:02:02.044 --> 00:02:04.460
the way from TensorFlow JS,
which is a very accessible way

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.370
to get into machine learning,
and auto ML, all the way up

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:08.150
to TPUs.

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:10.100
So our advanced
users have all that

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:11.584
compute to do cool stuff with.

00:02:11.584 --> 00:02:13.250
JEFF DEAN: Yeah, I
mean, I think there's

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.322
going to be a lot of
different levels of expertise

00:02:16.322 --> 00:02:18.030
and experience in
using machine learning,

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.990
and we to make all
of them able to use

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:23.704
machine learning to improve
their products in life.

00:02:23.704 --> 00:02:25.370
TIMOTHY JORDON: All
right so, let's talk

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:26.750
about what people are doing
with machine learning,

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:28.470
'cause we're getting there.

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.230
What are some things
that people are

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:32.313
doing in the world of
machine learning that you're

00:02:32.313 --> 00:02:33.860
the most excited about?

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.200
JEFF DEAN: There's like lots
of different applications.

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:37.700
One that I'm really
passionate about

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.949
is the use of machine learning
to improve health care.

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:42.440
I think there's a real
opportunity there,

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.630
for both kind of medical
imaging related problems,

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:46.880
we've been doing a lot of
work on diabetic retinopathy

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.713
and other kinds of
medical imaging problems.

00:02:48.713 --> 00:02:51.680
But also in how
patients' lives are

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.560
affected, how doctors are
able to care for patients,

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.090
with making better decisions,
a lot of advances there.

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:58.070
It's going to be great.

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.490
TIMOTHY JORDON: OK.

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:00.440
So there's these big
problems that we're

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:01.445
tackling with machine learning.

00:03:01.445 --> 00:03:02.440
What about everyday problems?

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.356
Is there something that
you encounter everyday

00:03:04.356 --> 00:03:06.549
that you would love
somebody to apply to?

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:08.090
JEFF DEAN: Yeah, I
think as you start

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:11.450
to have a machine learning lens,
as you walk around the world,

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:13.880
you can see things
that could be better.

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.910
For example, when I pull up
to a stoplight and it's red,

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:19.440
and there's no cars coming
the other direction,

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:20.640
that's just silly, right?

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.280
We should have
computer vision based

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.380
stoplights that
just allow people

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:26.030
to go when it's safe to go.

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:28.400
And that would be like
a simple improvement

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.080
in the world, that would
improve lots of people's lives.

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:32.010
TIMOTHY JORDON:
Thanks for joining me.

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:32.660
