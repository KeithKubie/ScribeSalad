00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:01.819
Hey you-- go take a hike!

00:00:01.819 --> 00:00:03.540
No, seriously…go do it.

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:09.400
Thank me later…

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:12.199
Hey nature enthusiasts, Jules here for DNews.

00:00:12.199 --> 00:00:16.029
You may have heard about the healing effects
of the great outdoors—specifically on our

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:17.090
mental health.

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:21.449
Being in nature can reduce stress, depression,
and anxiety, boost your mood, and impact other

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:22.680
mental functions.

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.669
But it turns out nature doesn’t just have
an effect on our minds -- it can also improve

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:27.779
our bodies.

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.439
Simple exposure to greenness, or natural vegetation,
has been shown to produce biological benefits

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:35.450
for our physical health and can even help
you live longer.

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:41.100
A study published in 2014 in the journal Environmental
Research examined green space proximity as

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.219
it related to stroke survivors.

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:48.850
After observing around 1600 survivors living
in the Boston area between 1999 and 2008,

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:53.109
researchers concluded that green space was
indeed associated with higher survival rates

00:00:53.109 --> 00:00:54.609
after having a stroke.

00:00:54.609 --> 00:00:58.449
Scientists suggested this could be due to
factors associated with nature – lower levels

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:02.590
of stress, better access to social networks,
and opportunities for physical activity.

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:06.400
Walking in nature can also have a positive
effect on people with Type II Diabetes.

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.851
A Japanese study at Hokkaido University School
of Medicine found that diabetic patients who

00:01:10.851 --> 00:01:15.530
took walks in the forest over a period of
6 years had consistently lower blood glucose

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:16.530
levels.

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.610
According to the study, outdoor environments
prompt changes in hormonal secretion and nervous

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.590
functions that can benefit insulin sensitivity
and blood glucose levels.

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.970
But another study published in 2012 found
that a mix of green and urban environments

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:32.290
may actually be better for you than just surrounding
yourself with nature.

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:37.630
The study from the journal BMC Public Health
observed 11,000 adults in Perth, Australia

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:42.520
and looked at places that had variable greenness,
which they define as areas with an “aesthetically

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.010
pleasing natural environment” plus “access
to urban destinations.”

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:50.530
They examined the link between variable greenness
and coronary heart disease and stroke, and

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:55.880
it turns out areas with high variable greenness
were associated with lower odds of hospitalization,

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.300
even lower than just predominantly green neighborhoods!

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:03.430
They say, [quote] “in terms of cardiovascular
health … both green and non-green areas

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:07.540
are necessary within walking distance, rather
than vegetation alone.”

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:11.680
They attribute this to the fact that in neighborhoods
with highly variable greenness, people will

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:16.150
walk around their environments more, thereby
increasing physical activity and overall health.

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:21.000
A variety of other studies show greenness
is associated with decreased obesity, increased

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.750
cardiovascular health and lower levels of
childhood asthma.

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.129
Researchers suggest that this is not just
due to physical activity but also lowered

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:32.760
exposure to air pollution, extreme heat, and
noise in vegetated areas.

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.879
Nature can also help the body heal, too.

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:39.209
A 1984 study published by the American Association
for the Advancement of Science found that

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:43.730
patients recovering from abdominal surgery
whose rooms overlooked trees, had an easier

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:48.239
time recovering, including needing fewer and
less extreme medications, and had shorter

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:52.049
hospital stays than those patients whose rooms
faced a brick wall.

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:56.349
The research suggested that simply viewing
natural environments has restorative effects

00:02:56.349 --> 00:03:00.719
on both emotional states and physiological
activity – prompting faster recovery.

00:03:00.719 --> 00:03:06.219
A 2008 study published in the journal HortTechnology
observed 90 patients recovering from appendectomy

00:03:06.219 --> 00:03:10.769
surgery who were assigned randomly to rooms
either with or without indoor plants.

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:15.629
They showed that those with plants had lower
blood pressure, less pain, anxiety and fatigue,

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:17.739
and greater satisfaction about their rooms.

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:21.909
Of course, further research is needed to learn
exactly what it is about the natural world

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:26.249
and its mechanisms that affect our physical
health, but with this body of evidence suggesting

00:03:26.249 --> 00:03:28.819
there is value in nature, why not try it?

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:32.529
Add a little green to your daily routine -- you
may be on your way to a longer, healthier

00:03:32.529 --> 00:03:33.529
life.

00:03:33.529 --> 00:03:36.769
So now that you know all about the physical
benefits of nature, what about what it’s

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:37.870
doing to your brain?

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:40.129
We cover that in this video right here.

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:42.389
What’s your favorite outdoor space to go
to?
