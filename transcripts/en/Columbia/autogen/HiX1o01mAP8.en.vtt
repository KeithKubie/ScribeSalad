modernism / modernity you know this in
 

01:28:52.050 --> 01:28:54.620
modernism / modernity you know this in
stylistic terms yes in let's say

01:28:54.620 --> 01:28:54.630
stylistic terms yes in let's say
 

01:28:54.630 --> 01:28:56.990
stylistic terms yes in let's say
histological terms maybe yes also

01:28:56.990 --> 01:28:57.000

this this question
 

01:29:08.020 --> 01:29:12.270
this this question
and the you know there's a little bit

01:29:12.270 --> 01:29:12.280
and the you know there's a little bit
 

01:29:12.280 --> 01:29:16.110
and the you know there's a little bit
more at play there than simply the kind

01:29:16.110 --> 01:29:16.120
more at play there than simply the kind
 

01:29:16.120 --> 01:29:18.210
more at play there than simply the kind
of let's say idea the architect as a

the clouds so in any case that maybe we

01:29:30.030 --> 01:29:30.040
the clouds so in any case that maybe we
 

01:29:30.040 --> 01:29:31.740
the clouds so in any case that maybe we
could and I think along those same lines

01:29:31.740 --> 01:29:31.750
could and I think along those same lines
 

01:29:31.750 --> 01:29:33.780
could and I think along those same lines
there's an important we need to make an

there's an important we need to make an
 

01:29:33.790 --> 01:29:35.430
there's an important we need to make an
important distinction between perception

01:29:35.430 --> 01:29:35.440
important distinction between perception
 

01:29:35.440 --> 01:29:38.280
important distinction between perception

imposing this question of power it seems
 

01:32:37.869 --> 01:32:39.479
imposing this question of power it seems
to me like there's there's something in

networks of power and there's a question
 

01:33:04.210 --> 01:33:05.700
networks of power and there's a question
about how they intersect with each other

01:33:05.700 --> 01:33:05.710
about how they intersect with each other
 

01:33:05.710 --> 01:33:06.720
about how they intersect with each other
and so it seemed to be the part

01:33:06.720 --> 01:33:06.730
and so it seemed to be the part
 

01:33:06.730 --> 01:33:10.560
and so it seemed to be the part

in their own power network so it seems

01:34:30.120 --> 01:34:30.130
in their own power network so it seems
 

01:34:30.130 --> 01:34:31.530
in their own power network so it seems
to me that it's a different way of

to me that it's a different way of

meetings so I think another interesting

01:35:39.719 --> 01:35:39.729
meetings so I think another interesting
 

01:35:39.729 --> 01:35:42.189
meetings so I think another interesting
way to look at this I the discussion of

01:35:42.189 --> 01:35:42.199
way to look at this I the discussion of

think the word authority allows us to

01:35:50.049 --> 01:35:50.059
think the word authority allows us to
 

01:35:50.059 --> 01:35:52.149
think the word authority allows us to
look at different types of authority

01:35:52.149 --> 01:35:52.159
look at different types of authority
 

01:35:52.159 --> 01:35:54.850

power it seems to be very to me to be

01:35:54.850 --> 01:35:54.860
power it seems to be very to me to be
 

01:35:54.860 --> 01:35:57.100
power it seems to be very to me to be
very one-sided and one person has power

01:35:57.100 --> 01:35:57.110
very one-sided and one person has power
 

01:35:57.110 --> 01:35:59.680
very one-sided and one person has power
over another pop another person but when

01:35:59.680 --> 01:35:59.690
over another pop another person but when
 

01:35:59.690 --> 01:36:00.879
over another pop another person but when
we talk about authority there are many

01:36:00.879 --> 01:36:00.889
we talk about authority there are many
 

01:36:00.889 --> 01:36:02.859
we talk about authority there are many
different ways that one person exercises

01:36:02.859 --> 01:36:02.869
different ways that one person exercises
 

01:36:02.869 --> 01:36:05.560
different ways that one person exercises
authority over another person and it

01:36:05.560 --> 01:36:05.570
authority over another person and it
 

01:36:05.570 --> 01:36:07.359
authority over another person and it
seems like in the three cases here we're

01:36:07.359 --> 01:36:07.369
seems like in the three cases here we're
 

01:36:07.369 --> 01:36:10.390
seems like in the three cases here we're
talking about a mentor relationship
