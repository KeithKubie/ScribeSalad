00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 align:start position:0%
evidence and this is a weak argument but
 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:19.400 align:start position:0%

understanding to account for this but
 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:22.070 align:start position:0%

I'll tell you something else that's
 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:23.780 align:start position:0%
I'll tell you something else that's
really<00:03:22.200><c> weird</c><00:03:22.470><c> I</c><00:03:22.709><c> don't</c><00:03:23.220><c> understand</c><00:03:23.640><c> this</c>

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 align:start position:0%

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:27.229 align:start position:0%
really weird I don't understand this
either<00:03:24.000><c> so</c><00:03:25.190><c> more</c><00:03:26.190><c> than</c><00:03:26.370><c> 90%</c><00:03:26.670><c> of</c><00:03:27.000><c> the</c><00:03:27.060><c> people</c>

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 align:start position:0%

because of the political stance I've
 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:42.920 align:start position:0%
because of the political stance I've

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:44.960 align:start position:0%
