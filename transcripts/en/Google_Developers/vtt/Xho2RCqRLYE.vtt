REBECCA MOORE: Good morning and
welcome to Maps for Good,

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:11.250
or what I think of as
maps that matter.

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.450
Because it turns out that maps
are not only useful for

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:18.280
navigating from point A to point
B, but can also be very

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:21.710
powerful tools to make the
world a better place.

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:22.370
My name is Rebecca Moore.

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:24.570
I'm engineering manager at
Google for Google Earth

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.910
Outreach and Google
Earth Engine.

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.120
And I'm pleased to have on the
panel Dave Thau, who's

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:35.460
developer advocate for Earth
Engine, and two of our lead

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.200
developers from nonprofit
partner organizations, Kevin

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.490
Bluer from Access Map and Jake
Wall from Save the Elephants.

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:47.250
Developers have a very important
role to play in

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.640
leveraging Google Earth,
Google Maps, all of our

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.880
mapping tools, to make the world
a better place, working

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:54.690
with nonprofits.

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:00.220
For me this all started
personally back in 2005 in my

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:01.790
community in the Santa
Cruz mountains.

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:08.260
Google Earth had just come
out two months earlier.

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.660
I opened the mail, and this
is what I received.

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:14.390
My neighbors and I got
this map in the mail.

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:15.810
What does it say?

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.590
Notice of intent to
harvest timber.

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:19.860
This is in the Santa Cruz
mountains above Las Gatos.

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:25.530
The legend says, hmm,
non-industrial timber

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:31.190
management plan area is bordered
by black lines.

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:33.230
Not terribly helpful.

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:37.290
There are helicopter landing
sites that are circles.

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.800
I'm a map person, you're
all map people.

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:44.140
But you can imagine that this
was difficult for most of my

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:45.530
neighbors to understand.

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:47.400
And so most of them simply
threw it out.

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.130
They just threw out this public
notice, which was maybe

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.540
the intent of the senders.

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:56.550
But I was concerned because
logging did not

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:58.080
sound like a good idea.

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.045
And so I thought, what would
happen-- and again, Google

00:02:01.045 --> 00:02:03.590
Earth had just come out
two months earlier--

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.440
if instead of this black and
white map, I tried to figure

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:10.789
out the elements of this plan
and remapped it instead on

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:11.730
Google Earth?

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.240
So first I found this location
on Google Earth, and

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:16.610
it looks like this.

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.830
Well, that's immediately a
whole lot more helpful to

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.590
understand what's going on.

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:25.130
And then, as I said, I took
those elements of the plan,

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:28.470
and I remapped it.

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.580
From this, I was personally
shocked.

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:34.810
And when I showed it to my
neighbors, they were shocked

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:39.030
because it became evident that
this was a very long, five

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:44.330
mile long swath of over 1,000
acres of old growth redwoods

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.880
that would be cut where the
logging would go right up next

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.720
to schools, day care center,
elementary school.

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.050
Helicopters would be landing and
taking off in perpetuity

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:56.260
over these playgrounds
and so on.

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.440
Just having the high-resolution
data and the

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:06.600
spatial information together
made that much more clear.

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.640
Of course, seeing it in
3D is even better.

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.920
And using SketchUp models of
helicopters, again, this could

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.160
make clear to people
what was at stake.

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:19.790
So I was a little bit
like Al Gore.

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:21.970
It was right in that period of
an Inconvenient Truth when Al

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:24.400
Gore was going around giving
slide shows everywhere.

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.030
I was trudging, not through the
snow, but trudging around

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:31.510
to different communities, to the
media, to politicians who

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:34.230
wanted to understand this plan
better than they could from

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:39.110
those grainy black and white
maps and a 400 page plan.

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:42.930
And in fact, what people stated,
and you can see this

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:46.480
here, has come up again and
again and again since then.

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.630
Things like, I thought I was
well informed until I looked

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:51.550
at this in Google Earth.

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:54.180
And this three-dimensional
presentation gave an amazing

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:56.850
topographic bird's-eye view
of how invasive the

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:58.180
logging will be.

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:00.060
So that began the sort
of seeing is

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:04.070
believing for public benefit.

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:06.690
The media picked this
up as well.

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:08.414
SPEAKER 1: Well, tonight, a
battle is brewing in the South

00:04:08.414 --> 00:04:11.350
Bay over plans to log
1,000 acres of land.

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:15.210
Tony Russomanno shows us exactly
what's at stake.

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:17.670
SPEAKER 2: We're taking a Google
Earth virtual flyover

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:20.519
along a five mile length of
Los Gatos Creek between

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:22.310
Lexington Reservoir
and Lake Elsman in

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:23.900
the Santa Cruz mountains.

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:27.450
The area in red, totaling 1,000
acres, is land that San

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:29.880
Jose Water Company
wants to log.

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:32.260
The map was created by a
software engineer who lives in

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:35.110
the area, and it's being used to
galvanize opposition to the

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:37.440
company's plan.

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:41.340
REBECCA MOORE: The point was
instead of it being abstract

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:44.260
roads and so on, you could see
it with your own eyes.

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.360
And it changed an abstract
concept to something that was

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:48.860
quite concrete.

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:52.430
Eventually, using Google Earth,
we were able to prove

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:56.570
that this logging plan was not
only a bad idea but it was in

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:58.100
fact illegal.

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:00.940
And to my knowledge this was
the first grassroots

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:04.240
environmental application
of Google Earth.

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:07.640
So we stopped the logging,
and now in fact--

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:08.604
[APPLAUSE]

00:05:08.604 --> 00:05:11.496
REBECCA MOORE: Thank you.

00:05:11.496 --> 00:05:14.390
Yay!

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:16.920
And now, in fact, the area is
being considered for public

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:20.160
open space and permanent
protection.

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:25.380
So that started getting a lot
of attention around the

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:27.480
blogosphere and media.

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:29.990
The Wall Street Journal wrote
this article, "Activists Start

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:32.630
Googling: Internet Maps
Illustrate Environmental

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:36.310
Woes." People were saying,
instead of climbing trees and

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:38.340
doing tree sits,
environmentalists are sitting

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:40.810
in front of Google Earth, and
that's how they're making a

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:41.750
difference.

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:44.040
People started writing to me.

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:45.320
And I was just a
Google engineer

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:46.350
working on Google Earth.

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:48.370
But all of these environmental
groups all over the world

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:52.050
started writing to me saying,
can you teach us what you did

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:53.810
so we can do the same thing?

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:56.350
So I started Google Earth
Outreach, our program to help

00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:58.830
nonprofits, as a 20% project.

00:05:58.830 --> 00:05:59.730
It's grown.

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:01.500
Members of our team are here.

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:02.940
We've worked with
more than 2,000

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:05.430
nonprofits around the world.

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:09.480
And it turns out that although
they are able to use our

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:12.230
tutorials, and they are doing
a lot of fantastic work on

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:15.560
their own, some of them need
help from professional

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:19.250
developers like you guys.

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:21.470
So, by the way, that's
our URL.

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:23.210
Please check it out.

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:27.950
So back in 2011, we started a
Developer Grants program where

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:33.350
we specifically awarded $10,000
to $20,000 to a number

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:36.400
of nonprofits, actually 16
different nonprofits, to

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:40.980
dedicate to hiring developers
to build these cutting edge

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:45.480
visualizations of their campaign
in Google Earth.

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:49.130
These are some of the projects
that have come out

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:51.230
in this last year.

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:52.840
I love the Atlantic
Public Media.

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:54.020
You should check it out.

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:56.420
Who would think that you would
get emotional about Arctic

00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:57.530
turn migration?

00:06:57.530 --> 00:07:00.110
But I guarantee you it will
bring a tear to your eye.

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:04.150
So again, I encourage you
to check this out.

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:08.430
You can imagine that if we did
a round of grants in 2011,

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:10.740
there may be an announcement we
have coming up at the end

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:12.240
of the talk today.

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:13.490
So please stay tuned.

00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:19.810
I'm just going to show you a
couple of these projects that

00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:22.860
resulted from the developer
grants in 2011.

00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:24.930
And here's one.

00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:27.960
Eyes on the Forest with World
Wildlife Federation.

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:29.910
The developer is David Tryse.

00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:33.440
They're using Google Maps
Engine-- and we now have a

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:35.930
grants program to give Google
Maps Engine for free to

00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:37.430
registered nonprofits--

00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:41.290
to show the change in forests
that's happening in Sumatra

00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:44.500
and how that relates to
shrinking tiger habitat.

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:47.330
All these data layers
are in Maps Engine.

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:50.410
So looking at these two,
the green area

00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:52.580
is 1990 forest cover.

00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:55.950
And the orange surrounded
grey area is

00:07:55.950 --> 00:07:57.640
suitable tiger habitat.

00:07:57.640 --> 00:08:00.310
You can see there's a very
strong correlation between

00:08:00.310 --> 00:08:03.270
forest and tiger habitat.

00:08:03.270 --> 00:08:07.840
Then you can see in 2000, the
forest cover is shrinking.

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:12.870
And you can see the tiger
habitat now is exposed where

00:08:12.870 --> 00:08:13.780
there's no forest.

00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:16.230
Let's go a little further
forward in time.

00:08:16.230 --> 00:08:18.960
2007, further shrinking
in forest.

00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:22.540
This is rampant deforestation
in Sumatra due to palm oil

00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:23.960
plantations.

00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:27.950
So finally, that's where
we are in 2009.

00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:30.100
And now if you project
where tigers can now

00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:32.840
live, it's like that.

00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:38.330
So this is a very visual way to
illustrate the driving of

00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:44.250
species toward extinction by
virtue of land use changes.

00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:47.740
A second really important
project, this is by the Halo

00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:50.320
Trust, which is a nonprofit
organization dedicated to

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:53.380
eradicating landmines
around the world.

00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:57.780
They use Google Earth Pro to
document which areas still

00:08:57.780 --> 00:09:00.080
have mines and are dangerous and
need to be cleared-- you

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:01.180
see those in red--

00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:04.120
and which areas have been
cleared in green and are safe

00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:05.370
for people to return.

00:09:07.690 --> 00:09:12.740
Here's an example in 2002
in Kunji, Angola.

00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:16.010
These areas in red were
too dangerous.

00:09:16.010 --> 00:09:19.050
And you can see the area
is not settled at all.

00:09:19.050 --> 00:09:23.070
No one lives near there because
of these dangers.

00:09:23.070 --> 00:09:25.610
Now fast forward to 2011.

00:09:25.610 --> 00:09:28.670
Those areas have been cleared
of landmines and now people,

00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:30.590
villages, are returning.

00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:34.650
It's safe for children
to walk to school.

00:09:34.650 --> 00:09:38.550
With their developer grant,
they built a Google Earth

00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:41.780
tour, an animated tour that's
actually narrated by Angelina

00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:45.900
Jolie, that shows more than 70
million land mines on the

00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:50.680
border between Cambodia and
Thailand and makes very

00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:54.030
evident what's at stake and why

00:09:54.030 --> 00:09:56.740
these issues are important.

00:09:56.740 --> 00:09:59.580
More than 70,000 displaced
people could return to their

00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:02.160
homes after these mines
were cleared.

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:07.130
And today they're growing wheat,
vegetables, and grapes.

00:10:07.130 --> 00:10:08.950
The last example I want to show
you before turning it

00:10:08.950 --> 00:10:12.010
over is cultural mapping.

00:10:12.010 --> 00:10:16.010
I think this is a really
important future frontier if

00:10:16.010 --> 00:10:19.640
you guys are interested
in indigenous culture.

00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:22.940
There are thousands of tribes
all over the world who are not

00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:25.190
on Google Earth and
Maps today.

00:10:25.190 --> 00:10:27.250
Their cultures are
not well mapped.

00:10:27.250 --> 00:10:30.640
And many of them would like
to get on the map.

00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:35.070
So in particular, Chief Almir
Surui from the Brazilian

00:10:35.070 --> 00:10:40.730
Amazon approached us in 2007 and
asked us if we would help

00:10:40.730 --> 00:10:45.770
document the illegal invasions
of his territory that were

00:10:45.770 --> 00:10:48.680
happening and help them put
their culture on the map.

00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:53.600
Working with our team, also with
an outside developer, we

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:57.750
just launched this
a week or so ago.

00:10:57.750 --> 00:11:01.405
Almost 300 place marks that tell
where they hunt, where

00:11:01.405 --> 00:11:03.620
they fish, where they gather the
wood for their arrows, the

00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:05.520
site of first contact.

00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:09.030
It's narrated, some of the
tours, by the Surui youth.

00:11:09.030 --> 00:11:11.800
And I can tell you that tribes
all over the world are

00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:14.250
contacting us because they
want to do the same.

00:11:14.250 --> 00:11:17.110
So if you as developers are
interested in that, please

00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:20.150
come talk to us.

00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:23.330
So to wrap it up, what are the
themes that we've been seeing

00:11:23.330 --> 00:11:25.860
in these first few years
of Maps for Good?

00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:28.010
First of all is seeing
is believing.

00:11:28.010 --> 00:11:31.070
You can show a politician charts
and graphs, and their

00:11:31.070 --> 00:11:32.220
eyes glaze over.

00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:35.510
But you show them the issue in
Google Earth and Maps, and in

00:11:35.510 --> 00:11:38.050
a minute, they can get the
issue, and you can make a

00:11:38.050 --> 00:11:39.680
change in policy.

00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:42.880
Groups like Halo Trust are using
it to actually run their

00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:44.690
day to day operations.

00:11:44.690 --> 00:11:47.410
And finally, maybe the biggest
thing, is people are using it

00:11:47.410 --> 00:11:52.190
to raise awareness, to inspire
donors, to inspire volunteers,

00:11:52.190 --> 00:11:57.020
and actually make the world
a better place.

00:11:57.020 --> 00:11:59.110
So with that, we're going
to turn it over.

00:11:59.110 --> 00:12:01.510
You're going to hear from Dave
Thau, who is going to talk

00:12:01.510 --> 00:12:04.730
about a next-generation platform
that our team has

00:12:04.730 --> 00:12:07.870
developed called Google
Earth Engine, which is

00:12:07.870 --> 00:12:11.510
petabyte-scale analysis of
satellite imagery, Kevin

00:12:11.510 --> 00:12:14.930
Bluer, who is going to talk
about Axis Map, and Jake Wall.

00:12:14.930 --> 00:12:16.180
Take it away, Dave.

00:12:21.530 --> 00:12:23.020
DAVE THAU: Thanks Rebecca.

00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:24.445
So I'm Dave Thau.

00:12:24.445 --> 00:12:27.310
I'm developer advocate on Google
Earth Engine, which

00:12:27.310 --> 00:12:30.330
means my job is to work with
developers who are creating

00:12:30.330 --> 00:12:33.590
applications to run on the Earth
Engine platform, which

00:12:33.590 --> 00:12:35.680
I'll tell you about now.

00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:42.100
This is Google Earth.

00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:44.190
So who here uses Google Earth?

00:12:44.190 --> 00:12:45.300
Yeah, all right.

00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:48.980
So you know it's a great
application for visualizing

00:12:48.980 --> 00:12:50.620
data and also collaborating.

00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:54.070
But one thing it's not really
designed for is doing analysis

00:12:54.070 --> 00:12:55.970
of earth data.

00:12:55.970 --> 00:12:59.160
And we've gotten feedback from
people saying, hey Google.

00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:02.790
You have a lot of geodata and a
lot of computational power.

00:13:02.790 --> 00:13:05.410
Why don't you give us the tools
that we need to be able

00:13:05.410 --> 00:13:07.210
to do analysis on your data?

00:13:07.210 --> 00:13:11.800
And that's what Earth Engine
was developed for.

00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:13.520
So let me give you
some examples of

00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:15.140
what I mean by analysis.

00:13:15.140 --> 00:13:18.790
For one, the United Nations,
last week, had a conference on

00:13:18.790 --> 00:13:20.530
sustainable development.

00:13:20.530 --> 00:13:23.460
One of the questions there is,
how can we minimize the

00:13:23.460 --> 00:13:25.920
environmental impact of growing
our population by two

00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:27.300
billion people?

00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:30.620
And one of the approaches to
that is to only develop in

00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:32.520
places that are already
developed.

00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:33.710
Don't develop in new places.

00:13:33.710 --> 00:13:36.290
So if there's not a road
someplace, don't start

00:13:36.290 --> 00:13:37.810
sticking roads there.

00:13:37.810 --> 00:13:40.390
So leading up to the conference,
we were approached

00:13:40.390 --> 00:13:42.120
by a member of the European
Parliament

00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:43.530
who said, hey Google.

00:13:43.530 --> 00:13:44.880
You have lots of road data.

00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:48.770
Can you create for us a map
of the roadless areas?

00:13:48.770 --> 00:13:53.990
And so we used the tool box that
we've been creating to

00:13:53.990 --> 00:13:54.890
create this map.

00:13:54.890 --> 00:13:59.970
So this is a map globally of
all the areas that are one

00:13:59.970 --> 00:14:03.240
kilometer away from
roads or nearer.

00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:05.240
So the white areas are
the ones that are

00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:06.710
right on the roads.

00:14:06.710 --> 00:14:09.320
And then there's a gradient
that goes off from there.

00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:12.990
So you can see down in Brazil,
there are lots of areas that

00:14:12.990 --> 00:14:13.850
don't have roads.

00:14:13.850 --> 00:14:17.150
But then there are these funny
little guys down here.

00:14:17.150 --> 00:14:20.160
These are little road networks
that are disconnected from

00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:20.760
everything.

00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:21.240
So it's kind of interesting.

00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:23.090
What's going on there?

00:14:23.090 --> 00:14:28.020
And you also can easily see that
places like Alaska, where

00:14:28.020 --> 00:14:29.630
you think that there are lots
of places where there are no

00:14:29.630 --> 00:14:31.135
roads, are highly developed.

00:14:31.135 --> 00:14:32.270
So there are lots
of roads here.

00:14:32.270 --> 00:14:34.790
So at a glance, you can look at
this map and find out where

00:14:34.790 --> 00:14:36.340
the roadless areas are.

00:14:36.340 --> 00:14:39.730
And this involved analyzing all
of road data that we have,

00:14:39.730 --> 00:14:43.610
which is millions of kilometers
of roads.

00:14:43.610 --> 00:14:47.000
So another kind of analysis is
deforestation detection.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.940
So here is the Surui territory
that Rebecca mentioned.

00:14:50.940 --> 00:14:52.940
You can see that it's pretty
well protected.

00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:54.340
This is their territory.

00:14:54.340 --> 00:14:55.990
All this is deforestation.

00:14:55.990 --> 00:14:58.770
And you can see on the edge,
there are little incursions of

00:14:58.770 --> 00:14:59.930
deforestation.

00:14:59.930 --> 00:15:03.180
And so you might want to ask,
when did those get there?

00:15:03.180 --> 00:15:03.960
Are they growing?

00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:06.770
How fast are they growing?

00:15:06.770 --> 00:15:08.330
And these are good
questions to ask.

00:15:08.330 --> 00:15:11.010
And you need to have access
to data to answer them.

00:15:11.010 --> 00:15:14.720
Now there's a underutilized
feature in Google Earth, which

00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:17.230
is the Historical Data button,
a little globe up

00:15:17.230 --> 00:15:18.180
here with an arrow.

00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:20.100
And with this, when you click
on this in Google Earth, you

00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:21.070
get a timeline.

00:15:21.070 --> 00:15:23.320
And you can actually go back to
historical data that's in

00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:24.720
Google Earth.

00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:25.780
But these are snapshots.

00:15:25.780 --> 00:15:27.430
They're really nice images
that we've gotten from

00:15:27.430 --> 00:15:28.540
satellites.

00:15:28.540 --> 00:15:30.190
But it's only every
once in a while.

00:15:30.190 --> 00:15:35.140
So this picture was
taken in 2009.

00:15:35.140 --> 00:15:36.930
Here's the next earliest
one, a couple of

00:15:36.930 --> 00:15:39.850
months earlier in 2008.

00:15:39.850 --> 00:15:41.710
And then going back in
time, this is the

00:15:41.710 --> 00:15:43.020
earliest image we have.

00:15:43.020 --> 00:15:45.680
So it's hard to look at those
data and be able to answer the

00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:47.690
questions like, how fast
is it growing and

00:15:47.690 --> 00:15:49.070
when did it get there?

00:15:49.070 --> 00:15:52.110
And so this is what we've
developed Earth Engine for, to

00:15:52.110 --> 00:15:56.330
give developers the ability
to ask those questions.

00:15:56.330 --> 00:15:59.090
So here's the Earth engine
in a nutshell.

00:15:59.090 --> 00:16:00.290
There are a couple components.

00:16:00.290 --> 00:16:04.050
One is we've been downloading
lots of satellite data and

00:16:04.050 --> 00:16:07.100
other sorts of data sets that
you might want access to.

00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:08.890
And I'll talk about
that in a second.

00:16:08.890 --> 00:16:12.360
On top of those data, we have
an API that lets you

00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:14.790
programmatically access
the data and run

00:16:14.790 --> 00:16:16.290
algorithms using it.

00:16:16.290 --> 00:16:17.880
And when you run the algorithms,
they run on the

00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:19.570
Google cluster.

00:16:19.570 --> 00:16:22.780
And also using the API, you
can build applications.

00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:24.740
So we have some applications
that we ourselves have built,

00:16:24.740 --> 00:16:27.670
and we're also working with
science partners and NGOs to

00:16:27.670 --> 00:16:28.920
build other applications.

00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:35.130
So here's a little bit about
the data that we have.

00:16:35.130 --> 00:16:38.860
We've been downloading entire
sets of satellite data.

00:16:38.860 --> 00:16:40.970
There is a series of satellites
called Landsat that

00:16:40.970 --> 00:16:44.100
have been going since 1972, and
we've been acquiring that

00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:45.310
whole catalog.

00:16:45.310 --> 00:16:47.340
So we have 40 years of
historical data.

00:16:47.340 --> 00:16:50.850
Most of it is daily data,
so daily up to 40 years.

00:16:50.850 --> 00:16:53.970
We're getting the satellite
data as it comes in daily.

00:16:53.970 --> 00:16:55.160
And we have other data sets.

00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:57.320
So we have elevation data,
atmospheric data.

00:16:57.320 --> 00:17:00.910
And as developers need more data
to do analyses that they

00:17:00.910 --> 00:17:06.270
think are important, we will be
adding those data as well.

00:17:06.270 --> 00:17:08.920
Now an interesting thing about
the data is it's full

00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:09.740
satellite data.

00:17:09.740 --> 00:17:12.670
So in Google Earth, what you
see is red, green, blue

00:17:12.670 --> 00:17:15.930
imagery taken from lots of
different kinds of satellites,

00:17:15.930 --> 00:17:18.270
but cleaned up and nicely
displayed so it

00:17:18.270 --> 00:17:19.200
looks really good.

00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:24.310
What we have in Earth Engine
is the raw satellite data.

00:17:24.310 --> 00:17:25.869
And you can do interesting
things with it.

00:17:25.869 --> 00:17:29.510
So here we have the
electromagnetic spectrum,

00:17:29.510 --> 00:17:30.970
ready for science.

00:17:30.970 --> 00:17:38.120
So here's some low wavelength
electromagnetic spectrum and

00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:40.410
it goes down to radio waves,
which are longer wavelengths.

00:17:40.410 --> 00:17:42.880
And the visible spectrum, where
red, green, and blue

00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:44.960
live, are in the middle.

00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:48.030
So the satellites that we tend
to use, use not only the

00:17:48.030 --> 00:17:52.270
visible spectrum, but also a
lot of stuff in infrared.

00:17:52.270 --> 00:17:56.870
So Landsat, which I mentioned,
has eight bands, Landsat 7, so

00:17:56.870 --> 00:17:58.240
I'll talk about just
some of them.

00:17:58.240 --> 00:18:01.270
So the first three bands are
blue, green, and red.

00:18:01.270 --> 00:18:02.820
So that's what you see
in Google Earth.

00:18:02.820 --> 00:18:05.310
But then in addition there
are infrared bands.

00:18:05.310 --> 00:18:06.550
And there's also
thermal bands.

00:18:06.550 --> 00:18:08.070
So you can measure heat.

00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:10.490
So what's nice about this is you
can combine these bands in

00:18:10.490 --> 00:18:13.140
various ways to see things you
wouldn't normally see if you

00:18:13.140 --> 00:18:15.730
just had RGB.

00:18:15.730 --> 00:18:17.860
So let's just take RGB.

00:18:17.860 --> 00:18:19.420
Here's an image around
Yosemite.

00:18:19.420 --> 00:18:21.045
If you haven't been to Yosemite,
go to Yosemite.

00:18:21.045 --> 00:18:21.890
It's stunning.

00:18:21.890 --> 00:18:24.150
It looks a lot better
than this.

00:18:24.150 --> 00:18:24.830
This is recent.

00:18:24.830 --> 00:18:27.880
This is taken not so long ago.

00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:30.850
Actually, no, this is a little
bit more towards the winter.

00:18:30.850 --> 00:18:32.300
But it's hard to see
what's going on.

00:18:32.300 --> 00:18:34.350
There is the snow.

00:18:34.350 --> 00:18:35.570
There are clouds.

00:18:35.570 --> 00:18:37.100
Somewhere in here
there's land.

00:18:37.100 --> 00:18:38.540
But it's hard to see, right?

00:18:38.540 --> 00:18:41.120
If you're interested in
vegetation, you can't really

00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:43.200
get it from this.

00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:47.590
But if you're interested in
vegetation, you can look at a

00:18:47.590 --> 00:18:49.240
combination of these bands,
the red band and

00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:50.950
in the near IR band.

00:18:50.950 --> 00:18:53.400
And when you do that, the
vegetation pops out.

00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:56.890
So from the same image, using
these different bands, you can

00:18:56.890 --> 00:18:59.600
see the vegetation here, the
less vegetation here, and no

00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:01.780
vegetation here.

00:19:01.780 --> 00:19:07.130
And similarly, if you're
interested in snow and water,

00:19:07.130 --> 00:19:10.830
you can use a different
set of bands, and snow

00:19:10.830 --> 00:19:12.740
and water pop out.

00:19:12.740 --> 00:19:15.980
So with this additional
information and the ability to

00:19:15.980 --> 00:19:18.910
analyze it, you can get to a
lot of features that you

00:19:18.910 --> 00:19:22.850
weren't able to with just RGB.

00:19:22.850 --> 00:19:24.360
Now that's the data.

00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:26.830
Now to analyze the data, to
access it, we have an API that

00:19:26.830 --> 00:19:27.700
we're building.

00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:30.290
The API is currently in
trusted tester mode.

00:19:30.290 --> 00:19:32.370
I'll give you an email address
to write to if you're

00:19:32.370 --> 00:19:34.040
interested in testing it out.

00:19:34.040 --> 00:19:35.330
So this is not the actual API.

00:19:35.330 --> 00:19:39.180
This is a pseudo code.

00:19:39.180 --> 00:19:41.060
But we have to APIs,
a JavaScript one

00:19:41.060 --> 00:19:41.840
and a Python one.

00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:43.990
And here's an example of the
kinds of things you can do

00:19:43.990 --> 00:19:45.890
pretty easily.

00:19:45.890 --> 00:19:47.200
So here's Landsat 7.

00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:49.600
I'm grabbing the Landsat
7 catalog here.

00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:52.780
I'm filtering it down
to just 2011 here.

00:19:52.780 --> 00:19:55.510
And here I'm doing something
pretty cool, I'm taking the

00:19:55.510 --> 00:19:59.400
median of every pixel in
the stack of images.

00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:02.840
So Landsat 7 circles around
every 16 days or so.

00:20:02.840 --> 00:20:05.010
So in a given year,
you might get 20

00:20:05.010 --> 00:20:06.890
images of the same spot.

00:20:06.890 --> 00:20:10.220
So here's the Bay Area.

00:20:10.220 --> 00:20:12.690
So you get 20 images
stacked up.

00:20:12.690 --> 00:20:17.250
And for each pixel in each
band, you figure out the

00:20:17.250 --> 00:20:19.690
median value, and you bring
it up to the top.

00:20:19.690 --> 00:20:21.260
So that's what median does.

00:20:21.260 --> 00:20:24.000
And that helps change
an image from this.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.210
So this is kind of a noisy
Landsat 7 image.

00:20:26.210 --> 00:20:28.220
There are funny stripes, there
are clouds, there are all

00:20:28.220 --> 00:20:29.590
kinds of stuff going on.

00:20:29.590 --> 00:20:33.980
Just by applying median and
displaying it on map, you get

00:20:33.980 --> 00:20:35.600
a much cleaner image.

00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:36.590
And so there you go.

00:20:36.590 --> 00:20:41.100
Four commands cleans up this
and gives you this.

00:20:41.100 --> 00:20:44.120
And the nice thing about the API
is it's designed to run in

00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:46.560
parallel in the Google cluster,
and that lets us

00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:49.100
scale very well.

00:20:49.100 --> 00:20:50.900
So show you how that works.

00:20:50.900 --> 00:20:53.600
Let's say you want to do some
deforestation detection on an

00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:55.630
image like this.

00:20:55.630 --> 00:21:00.480
What we do is we divide the
image up into little bits, and

00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:03.690
then we farm it out to lots
of different computers.

00:21:03.690 --> 00:21:05.420
And if you went to the keynote,
you can imagine how

00:21:05.420 --> 00:21:07.830
many computers you could farm
these things out to.

00:21:07.830 --> 00:21:11.180
600,000 cores, yes.

00:21:11.180 --> 00:21:17.460
Then you process the image
and recombine it.

00:21:17.460 --> 00:21:18.830
And you're done.

00:21:18.830 --> 00:21:23.970
So this allows us to scale to
very large, from states to

00:21:23.970 --> 00:21:27.400
countries, to continents,
to global analyses.

00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:30.050
One of the things we did was
this Mexico forest map.

00:21:30.050 --> 00:21:32.220
This is the highest resolution
map of forests in

00:21:32.220 --> 00:21:33.010
Mexico right now.

00:21:33.010 --> 00:21:35.500
The Mexican government
is validating it.

00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:38.000
It was 18 terabytes of data.

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:41.080
It took 15,000 hours to compute,
which would be years

00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:43.210
on a single CPU if nothing
went wrong.

00:21:43.210 --> 00:21:44.890
And it always does.

00:21:44.890 --> 00:21:46.020
But if took us less
than a day.

00:21:46.020 --> 00:21:48.830
It took about 14 hours because
we were able to spread it out

00:21:48.830 --> 00:21:51.020
over lots of computers.

00:21:51.020 --> 00:21:52.550
And the analysis--

00:21:52.550 --> 00:21:54.090
we worked with our science
partner Matt

00:21:54.090 --> 00:21:55.080
Hanson to do this.

00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:57.760
So it's his algorithms
to compute it.

00:21:57.760 --> 00:22:00.070
And it took data--

00:22:00.070 --> 00:22:02.990
here's Cancun.

00:22:02.990 --> 00:22:04.620
It took data that looked
like this.

00:22:04.620 --> 00:22:08.440
So this is actual Landsat 7
data, clouds, missing data.

00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:09.920
It's a mess.

00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:11.410
And turns it into this.

00:22:11.410 --> 00:22:13.040
So this gives you much clearer
idea of where the

00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:16.860
forest is in this area.

00:22:16.860 --> 00:22:18.290
So that's one example
of things we can do.

00:22:18.290 --> 00:22:19.680
We're also building
applications.

00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:21.520
So we have some of our own,
and we're working with

00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:23.580
partners to develop others.

00:22:23.580 --> 00:22:26.790
And they are using the
API to do that.

00:22:26.790 --> 00:22:28.180
So here's one application
that we're building.

00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:30.440
It's a classification engine.

00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:35.740
You can create mosaics,
composites of Landsat data.

00:22:35.740 --> 00:22:38.480
And then you can train
up a classifier.

00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:40.600
So we're piggybacking
off the Google

00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:42.060
prediction API for this.

00:22:42.060 --> 00:22:44.600
You can plop down some
points, some classes.

00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:45.610
So this is forest.

00:22:45.610 --> 00:22:46.490
This is not forest.

00:22:46.490 --> 00:22:48.160
You can upload data sets.

00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:50.450
You can upload already
classified images.

00:22:50.450 --> 00:22:53.890
And then you choose a
classifier, so [INAUDIBLE]

00:22:53.890 --> 00:22:56.610
phase, and you hit Classify.

00:22:56.610 --> 00:23:00.290
And then in seconds, you
get a classified map.

00:23:00.290 --> 00:23:02.740
So this is an application that
we're rolling out through

00:23:02.740 --> 00:23:03.680
trusted testers also.

00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:05.860
And the email address I'll
give you will give

00:23:05.860 --> 00:23:07.510
you access to this.

00:23:07.510 --> 00:23:10.450
And the last thing I'll talk
about is an application that

00:23:10.450 --> 00:23:14.570
we're building with an
NGO called Imazon.

00:23:14.570 --> 00:23:17.232
So Imazon is doing deforestation
monitoring in

00:23:17.232 --> 00:23:18.050
the Amazon.

00:23:18.050 --> 00:23:21.260
They have monthly reports that
they issue with how much

00:23:21.260 --> 00:23:23.700
deforestation is happening, and
they're a watchdog group

00:23:23.700 --> 00:23:28.240
that compares their results to
the Brazilian government.

00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:30.180
They have a desktop system
they've been using.

00:23:30.180 --> 00:23:32.910
But it takes about a month to
do a month's analysis, and

00:23:32.910 --> 00:23:34.640
it's just the Brazilian
Amazon.

00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:35.890
So they want to scale it up.

00:23:35.890 --> 00:23:37.160
They want to scale it
to the rest of the

00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:38.990
Amazon and more globally.

00:23:38.990 --> 00:23:41.730
And to do that they've ported
it over to Earth Engine.

00:23:41.730 --> 00:23:46.030
Next month, they're shifting
completely over, and they're

00:23:46.030 --> 00:23:48.590
going to be doing the reporting
from Earth Engine.

00:23:48.590 --> 00:23:51.290
This an application we've
built with them,

00:23:51.290 --> 00:23:52.080
built on the API.

00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:53.650
It's an HTML5 application.

00:23:53.650 --> 00:23:55.130
It uses canvas.

00:23:55.130 --> 00:23:59.410
You can do things like change
thresholding to change the

00:23:59.410 --> 00:24:02.730
sensitivity for deforestation
and degradation detection.

00:24:02.730 --> 00:24:04.390
And it's pretty snazzy.

00:24:04.390 --> 00:24:08.030
And they say it's cutting their
time for analysis in

00:24:08.030 --> 00:24:12.080
half from what they
have already.

00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:15.960
So to close, Earth Engine gives
you lots of satellite

00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:18.400
imagery and lots of other kinds
of data that you might

00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:22.850
want to use in analyses, and API
for analyzing those data,

00:24:22.850 --> 00:24:25.460
and the ability to run it
over the Google cluster.

00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:29.390
Thanks very much.

00:24:31.900 --> 00:24:37.000
If you want to play with the
API and that classifier,

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:39.390
here's the email address
to write to.

00:24:39.390 --> 00:24:42.250
If you do write to it, please
give some description of what

00:24:42.250 --> 00:24:43.610
you'd like to do.

00:24:43.610 --> 00:24:47.630
We're still working out the
details of the API.

00:24:47.630 --> 00:24:50.260
So we're rolling it out slowly
to trusted testers.

00:24:50.260 --> 00:24:52.370
So if you give us an idea of
what you want to do, that

00:24:52.370 --> 00:24:54.300
would be great.

00:24:54.300 --> 00:24:57.187
Thanks very much.

00:24:57.187 --> 00:25:01.570
[APPLAUSE]

00:25:01.570 --> 00:25:03.980
DAVE THAU: Now I'll turn things
over to Jason Dasilva

00:25:03.980 --> 00:25:08.600
who will talk about
AXS Maps, another

00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:10.932
Mapping for Good project.

00:25:10.932 --> 00:25:13.853
JASON DASILVA: Hi, my name is
Jason Dasilva, and I'm the

00:25:13.853 --> 00:25:14.960
founder of AXS Map.

00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:16.835
I have multiple sclerosis,
and getting

00:25:16.835 --> 00:25:18.390
around can be a challenge.

00:25:18.390 --> 00:25:21.720
So I came up with an idea.

00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:22.280
Hi.

00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:25.710
My name is Jason, and I use
a scooter to get around.

00:25:25.710 --> 00:25:27.520
It's not so easy.

00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:31.090
I have trouble going to stores,
finding bathrooms that

00:25:31.090 --> 00:25:33.815
are accessible, and meeting
up with friends.

00:25:37.866 --> 00:25:40.410
Of course, I can call ahead.

00:25:40.410 --> 00:25:43.390
But many places say they're
accessible, but really,

00:25:43.390 --> 00:25:45.030
they're not.

00:25:45.030 --> 00:25:48.700
There has to be a better way.

00:25:48.700 --> 00:25:50.290
So I had an idea.

00:25:50.290 --> 00:25:52.390
What if everyone could
share all the

00:25:52.390 --> 00:25:54.220
accessible places they know?

00:25:54.220 --> 00:25:58.490
And what if all this was put on
one map, and that map was

00:25:58.490 --> 00:26:00.675
available on the web
and mobile phones?

00:26:03.180 --> 00:26:09.160
I call it AXS Map, an online
and mobile app where anyone

00:26:09.160 --> 00:26:13.400
can search for accessible places
or review them on their

00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:15.950
entry ways or bathrooms.

00:26:15.950 --> 00:26:19.120
AXS Map opens up a whole
new world of choices.

00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:22.215
And I can instantly find all the
accessible places around

00:26:22.215 --> 00:26:27.890
me, where to eat, shop, grab
a coffee, or get a haircut.

00:26:27.890 --> 00:26:30.290
Even if you're not in a
wheelchair, you're invited to

00:26:30.290 --> 00:26:32.360
give ratings and contribute.

00:26:32.360 --> 00:26:35.280
AXS Map is powered by you.

00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:39.902
The more you review, the better
it gets for people with

00:26:39.902 --> 00:26:41.970
canes, walkers, or wheelchairs,
even moms and

00:26:41.970 --> 00:26:45.030
dads with strollers.

00:26:45.030 --> 00:26:48.980
AXS Map is your ticket
to mobility freedom.

00:26:48.980 --> 00:26:51.700
It's easy and free to use.

00:26:51.700 --> 00:26:54.310
Help make this world a
more inclusive one.

00:26:54.310 --> 00:26:56.470
Join the movement today.

00:26:56.470 --> 00:26:57.155
Check it out.

00:26:57.155 --> 00:26:58.405
AxsMap.com.

00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:11.862
So that's AXS Map.

00:27:11.862 --> 00:27:15.390
And just to give you a little
bit of context, accessibility

00:27:15.390 --> 00:27:16.926
is not just about convenience.

00:27:16.926 --> 00:27:19.110
It's a human right.

00:27:19.110 --> 00:27:21.045
And with that, I'm going to hand
you over to the developer

00:27:21.045 --> 00:27:23.921
of AXS Map, Kevin Bluer.

00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:32.220
KEVIN BLUER: OK.

00:27:32.220 --> 00:27:32.990
Hi guys.

00:27:32.990 --> 00:27:34.040
My name is Kevin Bluer.

00:27:34.040 --> 00:27:36.340
And as you just saw, that was
Jason Dasilva, who's the

00:27:36.340 --> 00:27:37.370
founder of AXS Map.

00:27:37.370 --> 00:27:41.390
And as he mentioned, I'm
one of the developers.

00:27:41.390 --> 00:27:43.460
So I'm just going to start with
a few screenshots of AXS

00:27:43.460 --> 00:27:46.390
Map, just to give you a flavor
of what we've built.

00:27:46.390 --> 00:27:51.080
So here is the search
results screen.

00:27:51.080 --> 00:27:53.430
On the left, you can see
the results, obviously.

00:27:53.430 --> 00:27:55.310
There are kind of two measures
there, so getting into a

00:27:55.310 --> 00:27:57.470
venue, and then once you're
inside, the restrooms.

00:27:57.470 --> 00:27:59.350
They're the kind of
two key measures.

00:27:59.350 --> 00:28:00.800
And we'll go into some
more in a moment.

00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:02.950
And on the right, you can
obviously see the map.

00:28:02.950 --> 00:28:05.410
That's actually Jason's
neighborhood in Williamsburg,

00:28:05.410 --> 00:28:06.990
Brooklyn, in New York.

00:28:06.990 --> 00:28:08.350
And already you can see
a few colored pins

00:28:08.350 --> 00:28:09.160
there, which is great.

00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:11.900
One of the goals of this is to
actually be able to see before

00:28:11.900 --> 00:28:14.430
you go or while you're on the
go, as well as seeing venues

00:28:14.430 --> 00:28:15.840
that are accessible
around you.

00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:21.940
This is a venue page.

00:28:21.940 --> 00:28:24.020
And as you can see, in terms of
the same results, the two

00:28:24.020 --> 00:28:24.740
kind of key measures.

00:28:24.740 --> 00:28:27.180
So getting into that venue and
once you're inside, as I

00:28:27.180 --> 00:28:28.130
mentioned, the rest rooms.

00:28:28.130 --> 00:28:30.330
We've got six additional
attributes in the middle of

00:28:30.330 --> 00:28:32.010
the screen there, these six
tiles that you can kind of

00:28:32.010 --> 00:28:33.910
click on when you're
adding a review.

00:28:33.910 --> 00:28:36.120
And that's things like spacious,
once you're inside

00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:38.460
the venue, whether they've got
an accessibility ramp,

00:28:38.460 --> 00:28:41.030
accessible parking, Braille
menus, et cetera.

00:28:41.030 --> 00:28:44.520
In the top right as well, you
can see we've embedded Google

00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:45.270
Street View.

00:28:45.270 --> 00:28:49.070
Which I know Jason used to use
prior to this tool existing

00:28:49.070 --> 00:28:51.470
just to get a glimpse from the
outside just to see how

00:28:51.470 --> 00:28:52.250
accessible the venue is.

00:28:52.250 --> 00:28:53.620
Now it's sort of embedded
in this tool.

00:28:53.620 --> 00:28:56.160
So a great use of Street
View there.

00:29:04.620 --> 00:29:05.690
This is just adding a review.

00:29:05.690 --> 00:29:08.090
Quite simply, you can see the
kind of bigger emphasis on

00:29:08.090 --> 00:29:10.070
kind of chunkier icons to make
the actual application a

00:29:10.070 --> 00:29:11.580
little more accessible.

00:29:11.580 --> 00:29:14.850
And you got the stars and the
tiles when he you're adding a

00:29:14.850 --> 00:29:17.300
review, and then obviously
comments.

00:29:17.300 --> 00:29:19.630
And then this, lastly, in terms
of the examples of the

00:29:19.630 --> 00:29:21.620
screen, so it's a little slow.

00:29:21.620 --> 00:29:22.590
OK, yeah.

00:29:22.590 --> 00:29:24.980
And this is just the
mobile app as well.

00:29:24.980 --> 00:29:27.950
We have both a mobile web
version and an Android version

00:29:27.950 --> 00:29:30.480
and an iOS version in
the works. too.

00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:32.780
And you can kind of see we've
got parity there between the

00:29:32.780 --> 00:29:37.970
main web and mobile web and
native apps as well.

00:29:37.970 --> 00:29:41.690
So stepping back in terms of
building the application, in

00:29:41.690 --> 00:29:43.750
terms of the kind of setting up
some of the goals when we

00:29:43.750 --> 00:29:45.840
sat down to build this.

00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:46.900
We obviously wanted to
make the application

00:29:46.900 --> 00:29:48.790
easy to use, of course.

00:29:48.790 --> 00:29:51.460
Broad appeal, so as Jason
mentioned in the animation

00:29:51.460 --> 00:29:55.020
there, everything from a
mother or father with a

00:29:55.020 --> 00:29:59.260
stroller, through to someone,
a user of a wheelchair.

00:29:59.260 --> 00:30:01.480
And then actually making the
application itself accessible.

00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:05.720
So we've kind of got a big
emphasis on bigger kind of

00:30:05.720 --> 00:30:09.110
fonts and icons, as you saw in
some of the screens, white on

00:30:09.110 --> 00:30:10.630
black fonts.

00:30:10.630 --> 00:30:13.540
Going for a big emphasis on
compliance, WCAG compliance in

00:30:13.540 --> 00:30:15.670
the actual app itself.

00:30:15.670 --> 00:30:17.060
In terms of when we were
building it as well, we

00:30:17.060 --> 00:30:21.030
actually built out a number of
interactive wire frames, used

00:30:21.030 --> 00:30:22.120
Balsamiq Mockups.

00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:23.300
I don't know if you guys are
familiar with that, but that's

00:30:23.300 --> 00:30:25.430
a great tool for actually kind
of mocking up the application.

00:30:25.430 --> 00:30:28.360
We actually got Jason using the
app and some of the other

00:30:28.360 --> 00:30:30.200
folks in the community to
actually sort of play around

00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:32.120
with it before we started
to build.

00:30:32.120 --> 00:30:34.090
So that was very useful.

00:30:34.090 --> 00:30:36.760
In terms of the technology stack
as well, on the back

00:30:36.760 --> 00:30:40.080
end, in terms of the API that
we call, on the Google side,

00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:42.890
we use Places API.

00:30:42.890 --> 00:30:44.530
As you saw, we use the Maps.

00:30:44.530 --> 00:30:45.490
We've embedded Street
View as well.

00:30:45.490 --> 00:30:47.880
So a great use of
great services.

00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:49.920
In terms of our stack,
it's MongoDB,

00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:54.310
node for the web server.

00:30:54.310 --> 00:30:56.050
And we also have our own
API, which I'll come to

00:30:56.050 --> 00:30:56.980
in a moment as well.

00:30:56.980 --> 00:31:00.510
And in terms of the clients,
for the web clients, usual

00:31:00.510 --> 00:31:03.420
suspects, so HTML5,
CSS, and script.

00:31:03.420 --> 00:31:06.590
And for the native Apps, we
actually used PhoneGap, or as

00:31:06.590 --> 00:31:09.810
it's now called since it's been
open sourced, Cordova,

00:31:09.810 --> 00:31:13.480
which I'll come to in
a moment as well.

00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:15.450
In terms of some of the
technical design decisions

00:31:15.450 --> 00:31:18.680
when we're building the tool,
I mentioned we're using node

00:31:18.680 --> 00:31:22.490
on the web server, so app
server, which essentially led

00:31:22.490 --> 00:31:25.330
us to having JavaScript
everywhere.

00:31:25.330 --> 00:31:28.420
It was my first project with
node, personally, and a great

00:31:28.420 --> 00:31:29.305
experience.

00:31:29.305 --> 00:31:31.460
Obviously this is a technical
crowd, so I'm sure a lot of

00:31:31.460 --> 00:31:33.380
you have familiarity with it.

00:31:33.380 --> 00:31:34.350
And yeah, it was great.

00:31:34.350 --> 00:31:36.840
There's definitely something to
be said for the elegance of

00:31:36.840 --> 00:31:40.500
having JavaScript across the
board right through to the

00:31:40.500 --> 00:31:45.630
data that comes out of the Mongo
database in this case.

00:31:45.630 --> 00:31:50.070
And in terms of Cordova or
PhoneGap as well, again,

00:31:50.070 --> 00:31:51.090
personally it was my first
experience with it.

00:31:51.090 --> 00:31:53.110
But it was a great stack.

00:31:53.110 --> 00:31:55.920
And I think one of the takeaways
there was it really

00:31:55.920 --> 00:31:57.350
depends on the application.

00:31:57.350 --> 00:32:00.000
And if you're not familiar with
it, it's just a framework

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:03.710
that allows you to port web
languages-- so your markups,

00:32:03.710 --> 00:32:06.390
script, style sheets, and so
on-- into native applications.

00:32:06.390 --> 00:32:10.620
You can the sensors
on the hardware

00:32:10.620 --> 00:32:14.350
through that framework.

00:32:14.350 --> 00:32:16.700
As mentioned, we have
an API as well.

00:32:16.700 --> 00:32:20.700
This is one of the key things
to communicate today.

00:32:20.700 --> 00:32:22.730
It's got kind of two
core elements.

00:32:22.730 --> 00:32:24.930
So we have essentially an
augmentation layer on top of

00:32:24.930 --> 00:32:26.050
the Google Places API.

00:32:26.050 --> 00:32:29.500
So any call that's made to our
API, we're in turn calling the

00:32:29.500 --> 00:32:33.260
Google Places API and then
looking up to see if we have

00:32:33.260 --> 00:32:35.820
any accessibility data on
that particular venue.

00:32:35.820 --> 00:32:38.050
And if we do, then we return
that on top and take a little

00:32:38.050 --> 00:32:41.970
snippet of the JSON response
that we inject in there.

00:32:41.970 --> 00:32:44.230
So things like all the kind
of things you saw earlier.

00:32:44.230 --> 00:32:47.770
So getting in, the one to five,
and restrooms, one to

00:32:47.770 --> 00:32:49.040
five, and so on.

00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:52.560
And key takeaway is we'd
love to share this.

00:32:52.560 --> 00:32:55.410
So if there's any need to
embed accessibility

00:32:55.410 --> 00:32:57.930
information into your
applications, feel free to

00:32:57.930 --> 00:32:58.460
reach out to us.

00:32:58.460 --> 00:32:59.450
My email address is up there.

00:32:59.450 --> 00:33:02.910
And feel free to come
and chat after.

00:33:02.910 --> 00:33:05.420
We'd love to integrate
this into Apps.

00:33:05.420 --> 00:33:06.680
It's one of the kind
of goals as Jason

00:33:06.680 --> 00:33:09.710
mentioned at the start.

00:33:09.710 --> 00:33:13.950
Just to close, in an upcoming
release, we have an immediate

00:33:13.950 --> 00:33:19.060
term release where we're going
to be adding photo upload and

00:33:19.060 --> 00:33:22.300
richer filters, which will allow
you to take pictures of

00:33:22.300 --> 00:33:27.240
key accessibility points as you
are going out and mapping

00:33:27.240 --> 00:33:29.100
venues within cities
and so on.

00:33:29.100 --> 00:33:31.250
And in terms of the filters as
well, so you can actually kind

00:33:31.250 --> 00:33:34.670
of query it to say show me a
venue that has Braille menus

00:33:34.670 --> 00:33:38.670
in a 50-meter radius
around me.

00:33:38.670 --> 00:33:40.610
We also have a number
of tweaks around the

00:33:40.610 --> 00:33:43.070
accessibility of the app that
we're going to be releasing.

00:33:43.070 --> 00:33:47.380
And on the right hand side of
the screen, we've just added a

00:33:47.380 --> 00:33:48.910
number of the kind of more of
the blue sky things that we

00:33:48.910 --> 00:33:52.230
would like to do in the more
medium to long term.

00:33:52.230 --> 00:33:54.900
This first one there
is visualization.

00:33:54.900 --> 00:33:58.230
So to answer questions, such
as, how accessible is your

00:33:58.230 --> 00:34:00.040
neighborhood or city?

00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:01.940
To compare those is
a big win for us.

00:34:01.940 --> 00:34:04.100
And as we're building this
data set that's becoming

00:34:04.100 --> 00:34:07.240
something feasible that we can
actually start to answer.

00:34:07.240 --> 00:34:09.170
And the top right there, we've
got augmented reality.

00:34:09.170 --> 00:34:12.179
So we actually kind of did build
a quick prototype of an

00:34:12.179 --> 00:34:13.050
AR interface.

00:34:13.050 --> 00:34:15.880
So you can kind of see
the cool demos there.

00:34:15.880 --> 00:34:18.130
But in this case, you can
actually see the venues

00:34:18.130 --> 00:34:20.489
hovering around you and their
degree of accessibility.

00:34:20.489 --> 00:34:21.880
So that's pretty neat.

00:34:21.880 --> 00:34:25.550
And then finally gamification,
so adding game mechanics and

00:34:25.550 --> 00:34:29.920
incentivization mechanics to the
application just to make

00:34:29.920 --> 00:34:31.170
it a little bit more sticky.

00:34:33.630 --> 00:34:35.070
So that's it from me.

00:34:35.070 --> 00:34:36.889
Yeah, so as I said, definitely
reach out after.

00:34:36.889 --> 00:34:39.969
I would love to chat and look at
maybe getting accessibility

00:34:39.969 --> 00:34:41.620
into your applications.

00:34:41.620 --> 00:34:43.820
So with that, I'm going to hand
over to Jake Wall from

00:34:43.820 --> 00:34:44.820
Save the Elephants.

00:34:44.820 --> 00:34:46.309
So thanks very much.

00:34:46.309 --> 00:34:59.040
[APPLAUSE]

00:34:59.040 --> 00:35:00.290
JAKE WALL: So good afternoon.

00:35:07.560 --> 00:35:10.270
So my name's Jake Wall, and I'm
a researcher from a group

00:35:10.270 --> 00:35:14.010
called Save the Elephants
in Kenya.

00:35:14.010 --> 00:35:16.320
So Save the Elephants is
primarily a conservation group

00:35:16.320 --> 00:35:19.710
but with a strong focus on
scientific research.

00:35:19.710 --> 00:35:21.250
For the last 15 years,
our group has

00:35:21.250 --> 00:35:22.730
been studying elephants.

00:35:22.730 --> 00:35:24.540
And through the lens of science,
we're trying to paint

00:35:24.540 --> 00:35:25.880
a picture of what elephants
need to

00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:28.000
survive on this planet.

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:30.790
A central focus has been on
movement ecology of elephants

00:35:30.790 --> 00:35:33.360
and includes looking at home
range, migratory patterns, and

00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:35.790
other spatial behaviour.

00:35:35.790 --> 00:35:37.485
And to do this, we do
a lot of mapping.

00:35:41.380 --> 00:35:44.440
So to follow the movements of
elephants, we use GPS tracking

00:35:44.440 --> 00:35:48.770
collars, which we fit around
the neck of an elephant.

00:35:48.770 --> 00:35:50.440
It's basically an indestructible
box.

00:35:50.440 --> 00:35:53.390
It carries a GPS receiver,
lithium battery, and since

00:35:53.390 --> 00:35:55.720
2004, it carries a cell phone.

00:35:55.720 --> 00:35:58.750
And here you can see a bull
elephant called Yeager

00:35:58.750 --> 00:36:02.870
sniffing old collars
in our camp.

00:36:02.870 --> 00:36:05.270
So the Elephant needs to be
tranquilized in order to fit

00:36:05.270 --> 00:36:06.840
the collar.

00:36:06.840 --> 00:36:09.270
Once the collar's been put on,
though, it can generally last

00:36:09.270 --> 00:36:10.480
for up to five years.

00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:13.150
And it takes positions
generally every hour.

00:36:13.150 --> 00:36:16.255
So think of your cell phone
making a call every hour for

00:36:16.255 --> 00:36:18.770
five years.

00:36:18.770 --> 00:36:21.530
The real time tracking has
opened up all kinds of new

00:36:21.530 --> 00:36:24.110
opportunities for elephant
conservation.

00:36:24.110 --> 00:36:26.510
And today I'm going to show you
the system that we built

00:36:26.510 --> 00:36:27.990
to track elephants
in real time.

00:36:31.380 --> 00:36:33.470
So first I want to mention
three of the

00:36:33.470 --> 00:36:35.720
challenges to our system.

00:36:35.720 --> 00:36:39.030
One was that the data
had to be secure.

00:36:39.030 --> 00:36:42.870
So we needed password
authentication.

00:36:42.870 --> 00:36:45.310
Because of the poaching that's
going on now of African

00:36:45.310 --> 00:36:48.680
elephants, there's a real threat
to elephants if this

00:36:48.680 --> 00:36:51.340
information was to get out.

00:36:51.340 --> 00:36:53.050
The second is at that the
data needed to be as

00:36:53.050 --> 00:36:54.390
real time as possible.

00:36:54.390 --> 00:36:58.250
So for management or
conservation action, we need

00:36:58.250 --> 00:37:02.120
data as it occurs.

00:37:02.120 --> 00:37:04.060
And the third was that there's
multiple tiers of

00:37:04.060 --> 00:37:05.250
users of our system.

00:37:05.250 --> 00:37:08.510
So on one side, we have
scientific researchers who

00:37:08.510 --> 00:37:11.200
need the data as it is, as it
comes off the elephant.

00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:14.360
On the other side, there's
members of the public who

00:37:14.360 --> 00:37:18.030
maybe are interested in
education and learning about

00:37:18.030 --> 00:37:20.110
elephants but don't need
the actual real

00:37:20.110 --> 00:37:21.820
time location of elephants.

00:37:21.820 --> 00:37:27.640
We had to build the system
to encompass all of that.

00:37:27.640 --> 00:37:30.920
So here's our tracking system.

00:37:30.920 --> 00:37:32.170
It's a little confusing.

00:37:34.750 --> 00:37:37.330
Basically, on the left side,
we have our data inputs.

00:37:37.330 --> 00:37:41.530
So these are collars, so
elephants wearing collars.

00:37:41.530 --> 00:37:45.240
Here we have a cloud server,
which ingests the data.

00:37:45.240 --> 00:37:47.660
We store it in a Postgres
database.

00:37:47.660 --> 00:37:50.420
And then on the right
side, we have users.

00:37:50.420 --> 00:37:51.930
So we've got different--

00:37:51.930 --> 00:37:55.745
so wildlife managers, rangers,
and administrator, researcher.

00:37:58.910 --> 00:38:03.370
So animal link is our primary
software that ingests data

00:38:03.370 --> 00:38:07.160
from the different collars.

00:38:07.160 --> 00:38:09.900
And then we have a movement
monitor software, an events

00:38:09.900 --> 00:38:13.190
monitor software, which
looks for anything

00:38:13.190 --> 00:38:14.420
strange with the data.

00:38:14.420 --> 00:38:17.910
So it can alert us if an
elephant stopped moving or has

00:38:17.910 --> 00:38:19.560
crossed a fence line,
et cetera.

00:38:19.560 --> 00:38:22.670
So there are several different
tasks that it performs.

00:38:22.670 --> 00:38:25.370
So what I'll do is walk you
through the lifetime of a GPS

00:38:25.370 --> 00:38:29.430
fix from the collar to our
system and to the user.

00:38:34.200 --> 00:38:40.300
So say we've got a collar
here on an elephant,

00:38:40.300 --> 00:38:42.110
and it takes a fix.

00:38:42.110 --> 00:38:44.840
It sends that fix via the local
cell phone network in

00:38:44.840 --> 00:38:48.320
Kenya via TCP/IP.

00:38:48.320 --> 00:38:51.340
And then our animal
link software is

00:38:51.340 --> 00:38:52.900
listening on that port.

00:38:52.900 --> 00:38:56.850
And it ingests any data that
it reads in from that port.

00:38:56.850 --> 00:38:58.960
And it stores it in the animal
tracking database.

00:39:03.110 --> 00:39:07.150
It then tries to parse the
data for coordinates and

00:39:07.150 --> 00:39:10.090
stores the location data into
the animal tracking database.

00:39:13.580 --> 00:39:19.270
At this point, users of Google
Earth can query our KML

00:39:19.270 --> 00:39:20.910
tracking service which
is running.

00:39:24.610 --> 00:39:28.030
So any user of Google Earth can
connect via the tracking

00:39:28.030 --> 00:39:33.760
service, which then queries the
database and turns the raw

00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:37.020
coordinate data into KML
and sends it back to

00:39:37.020 --> 00:39:38.544
the user like that.

00:39:41.440 --> 00:39:45.230
So we're using a Windows
Communication Foundation data

00:39:45.230 --> 00:39:48.080
contract as the basis
for this.

00:39:48.080 --> 00:39:52.620
So here we have what's called a
data structure service and a

00:39:52.620 --> 00:39:53.800
tracking service.

00:39:53.800 --> 00:39:57.710
So the data structure service
defines the number of nodes in

00:39:57.710 --> 00:40:02.950
the tree, and I'll show you that
in a second, whereas the

00:40:02.950 --> 00:40:05.800
tracking service is what
actually gives you real time

00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:08.970
tracking data.

00:40:08.970 --> 00:40:13.850
So within our system Google
Earth has become an essential

00:40:13.850 --> 00:40:16.240
geovisualization tool.

00:40:16.240 --> 00:40:18.460
Although it might seem a simple
idea, transformation of

00:40:18.460 --> 00:40:20.850
raw coordinates into a movement
trajectory that can

00:40:20.850 --> 00:40:24.530
be visualized and replayed in
the context of terrain,

00:40:24.530 --> 00:40:26.760
vegetation, and human
infrastructure is an

00:40:26.760 --> 00:40:29.400
incredibly powerful tool.

00:40:29.400 --> 00:40:31.150
This wasn't at all easy
until the release of

00:40:31.150 --> 00:40:32.570
Google Earth in 2005.

00:40:32.570 --> 00:40:33.940
And we've had a close
partnership with

00:40:33.940 --> 00:40:35.790
Google since then.

00:40:35.790 --> 00:40:37.650
As Rebecca said, seeing
is believing.

00:40:37.650 --> 00:40:39.410
So I'm now going to show
you a live demo of

00:40:39.410 --> 00:40:40.660
our tracking service.

00:40:56.740 --> 00:41:00.800
So here's our tracking
service.

00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:04.930
And this is all coming live
from our cloud server.

00:41:04.930 --> 00:41:10.280
So when I click on this link,
it's going to generate KML.

00:41:10.280 --> 00:41:11.850
And you saw how quickly
that was.

00:41:11.850 --> 00:41:15.140
So that's querying the database,
and it's creating

00:41:15.140 --> 00:41:18.290
KML tracks for all these
elephants in real time.

00:41:21.250 --> 00:41:23.550
And we're not just confined
to elephants actually.

00:41:23.550 --> 00:41:26.130
We've got a number of
different species.

00:41:26.130 --> 00:41:29.170
But I'll show you one
of our elephants.

00:41:29.170 --> 00:41:31.855
So we're going to look now at
an elephant called Mountain

00:41:31.855 --> 00:41:34.970
Bull who's become
famous recently.

00:41:34.970 --> 00:41:38.780
He was the star of a BBC film.

00:41:38.780 --> 00:41:40.200
And here he is.

00:41:40.200 --> 00:41:43.460
So if I click on his data.

00:41:43.460 --> 00:41:45.680
And this is all temporal
data, so I can use

00:41:45.680 --> 00:41:48.560
the time slider feature.

00:41:48.560 --> 00:41:51.230
And this is the real
time location.

00:41:51.230 --> 00:41:52.730
So within the last hour.

00:41:52.730 --> 00:41:57.100
So we're zoomed into an area
of Kenya right now.

00:41:57.100 --> 00:41:58.590
And he's--

00:41:58.590 --> 00:42:00.820
actually some really interesting
behavior here.

00:42:00.820 --> 00:42:04.420
What he's done is he's walked up
to-- this is the main Cape

00:42:04.420 --> 00:42:06.080
to Cairo highway.

00:42:06.080 --> 00:42:09.130
And you can see how he's hit
the highway and he's

00:42:09.130 --> 00:42:09.790
come back from it.

00:42:09.790 --> 00:42:12.690
And he's probably going to wait
until night time before

00:42:12.690 --> 00:42:14.810
he crosses that highway.

00:42:14.810 --> 00:42:17.690
So that's the real time location
of a bull elephant in

00:42:17.690 --> 00:42:21.240
Kenya at this moment.

00:42:21.240 --> 00:42:24.050
So an interesting note about
this elephant and why I chose

00:42:24.050 --> 00:42:28.240
him was that a few
years ago, he was

00:42:28.240 --> 00:42:30.820
accused of crop raiding.

00:42:30.820 --> 00:42:35.350
So in Kenya right now, there's
a problem with human/wildlife

00:42:35.350 --> 00:42:39.290
conflict and wildlife living on
the margins of places where

00:42:39.290 --> 00:42:41.840
people are growing
crops and so on.

00:42:41.840 --> 00:42:45.050
And Mountain Bull was accused
of crop raiding.

00:42:45.050 --> 00:42:49.110
And we quickly got onto Google
Earth and were able

00:42:49.110 --> 00:42:50.730
to pull up his track.

00:42:50.730 --> 00:42:54.930
And the Kenya Wildlife Service
in certain cases has the

00:42:54.930 --> 00:42:58.260
option to destroy an animal if
they've found that they've

00:42:58.260 --> 00:43:02.370
been very harmful to people.

00:43:02.370 --> 00:43:05.190
But we were able to get onto
Google Earth and check out his

00:43:05.190 --> 00:43:08.110
track and prove that he was not
the elephant in question,

00:43:08.110 --> 00:43:10.880
that he had been nowhere near
the farms in question.

00:43:10.880 --> 00:43:12.600
And so we got him
off the hook.

00:43:12.600 --> 00:43:14.500
And he lives to this day.

00:43:14.500 --> 00:43:16.860
So that was very good.

00:43:19.820 --> 00:43:21.190
So let me switch back.

00:43:26.580 --> 00:43:27.670
And there's Mountain Bull.

00:43:27.670 --> 00:43:31.250
So that's the bull
you've just seen.

00:43:31.250 --> 00:43:33.660
So our KML tracking service is
therefore used by everyone

00:43:33.660 --> 00:43:36.450
from rangers on patrol in Kenya
to researchers studying

00:43:36.450 --> 00:43:38.750
behavior in a university and
has become an essential

00:43:38.750 --> 00:43:40.300
conservation tool.

00:43:40.300 --> 00:43:42.580
Globally, technology is playing
a bigger role in

00:43:42.580 --> 00:43:44.850
wildlife conservation
management.

00:43:44.850 --> 00:43:47.630
Software, databases, and sensors
are the new notebook,

00:43:47.630 --> 00:43:50.390
pen, and binoculars
for field work.

00:43:50.390 --> 00:43:52.960
Through continued partnership
with companies like Google

00:43:52.960 --> 00:43:55.990
that have a global conscience
and the resources to make

00:43:55.990 --> 00:43:57.900
things happen, we hope
to continue to

00:43:57.900 --> 00:43:59.540
save elephants together.

00:43:59.540 --> 00:43:59.850
Thank you.

00:43:59.850 --> 00:44:02.148
And I'll pass it back
to Rebecca.

00:44:02.148 --> 00:44:10.560
[APPLAUSE]

00:44:10.560 --> 00:44:12.110
REBECCA MOORE: Thanks, Jake.

00:44:12.110 --> 00:44:14.720
Yeah, I think about Brian
McClendon, one of the

00:44:14.720 --> 00:44:17.120
inventors of Keyhole that
became Google Earth.

00:44:17.120 --> 00:44:19.680
Would he have ever imagined
that a few years in the

00:44:19.680 --> 00:44:23.820
future, it would be used to save
an elephant from being

00:44:23.820 --> 00:44:27.730
falsely accused of crop crime?

00:44:27.730 --> 00:44:33.360
So we're going to end by
announcing here today the 2012

00:44:33.360 --> 00:44:37.080
round of Google Earth Outreach
developer grants.

00:44:37.080 --> 00:44:38.330
Here's how it works.

00:44:40.810 --> 00:44:45.360
The grants are in the range
of $10,000 to $20,000.

00:44:45.360 --> 00:44:50.020
The goal is to help support
developers and nonprofits in

00:44:50.020 --> 00:44:54.530
building cutting edge
applications that both drive

00:44:54.530 --> 00:44:59.040
the state of the art of mapping
technology and also

00:44:59.040 --> 00:45:03.790
advance some public benefit
purpose in a new way.

00:45:07.300 --> 00:45:09.580
So how does it work?

00:45:09.580 --> 00:45:13.980
It's actually the nonprofit
organizations who apply.

00:45:13.980 --> 00:45:17.780
We've found that the ones that
are most successful in getting

00:45:17.780 --> 00:45:21.420
approved actually have a
relationship with a developer.

00:45:21.420 --> 00:45:23.510
So they're able to put
together a thoughtful

00:45:23.510 --> 00:45:25.120
application.

00:45:25.120 --> 00:45:29.680
The funding that goes to those
grants that are awarded is

00:45:29.680 --> 00:45:33.500
100% dedicated to
the developers.

00:45:33.500 --> 00:45:35.120
So what should you do?

00:45:35.120 --> 00:45:38.780
Well, if you already have some
kind of relationship with a

00:45:38.780 --> 00:45:42.060
nonprofit organization, you
have an idea together of

00:45:42.060 --> 00:45:44.990
something you might want to
work on, by all means

00:45:44.990 --> 00:45:46.900
encourage them.

00:45:46.900 --> 00:45:49.350
And work with them to put
together a proposal.

00:45:49.350 --> 00:45:53.590
The deadline is August
1 for this round.

00:45:53.590 --> 00:45:56.940
If you don't specifically have
a project in mind or a

00:45:56.940 --> 00:46:00.140
relationship with a nonprofit,
but you're interested in

00:46:00.140 --> 00:46:03.080
working in this space, we
highly encourage you to

00:46:03.080 --> 00:46:05.830
register yourself, your
portfolio, your skills, your

00:46:05.830 --> 00:46:09.020
interests in our developer
marketplace.

00:46:09.020 --> 00:46:13.070
This is where we direct
non-profits to go when they're

00:46:13.070 --> 00:46:14.670
looking for a developer.

00:46:14.670 --> 00:46:17.340
I'll show you more about
that in a second.

00:46:17.340 --> 00:46:21.620
For those of you who are here at
I/O, please come talk to us

00:46:21.620 --> 00:46:24.840
at the Develop for Good booth
that's right nearby

00:46:24.840 --> 00:46:26.300
here on floor two.

00:46:26.300 --> 00:46:29.830
And you can meet with our team,
you can talk with Jake

00:46:29.830 --> 00:46:33.170
and Kevin and get more
information and maybe

00:46:33.170 --> 00:46:37.050
brainstorm ideas for this
round of grants.

00:46:37.050 --> 00:46:39.975
So getting in the developer
marketplace, there's the URL.

00:46:39.975 --> 00:46:42.020
This is on our Earth
Outreach site.

00:46:42.020 --> 00:46:44.070
It's a pretty straightforward
process.

00:46:44.070 --> 00:46:49.800
We're going to fast track those
developer marketplace

00:46:49.800 --> 00:46:52.500
applications that are coming in
now so that you can be in

00:46:52.500 --> 00:46:56.210
there for nonprofits in this
round of grants to consider

00:46:56.210 --> 00:46:57.460
your services.

00:46:59.450 --> 00:47:03.800
So with that, thank
you very much for

00:47:03.800 --> 00:47:06.000
coming to Maps for Good.

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:09.710
And hopefully, you're a little
bit inspired to help make the

00:47:09.710 --> 00:47:11.150
world a better place
through mapping.

00:47:11.150 --> 00:47:13.420
Please join me in thanking
everyone on the panel.

00:47:13.420 --> 00:47:20.580
[APPLAUSE]

00:47:20.580 --> 00:47:21.770
REBECCA MOORE: We do have a few

00:47:21.770 --> 00:47:23.240
minutes if you have questions.

00:47:28.220 --> 00:47:29.630
Yes?

00:47:29.630 --> 00:47:31.360
AUDIENCE: We have a lot
of orthographic data

00:47:31.360 --> 00:47:33.400
that we've paid for.

00:47:33.400 --> 00:47:36.790
And is it possible to submit
that into the database that

00:47:36.790 --> 00:47:38.090
Google has?

00:47:38.090 --> 00:47:38.330
REBECCA MOORE: Yeah.

00:47:38.330 --> 00:47:39.880
A couple options there.

00:47:39.880 --> 00:47:43.120
One is Maps Engine,
which is hosting

00:47:43.120 --> 00:47:45.130
your data in the cloud.

00:47:45.130 --> 00:47:49.540
So if you are a nonprofit, you
can apply for a free grant of

00:47:49.540 --> 00:47:52.480
Google Maps Engine and
upload your own data.

00:47:52.480 --> 00:47:55.940
If you want to contribute it to
Google, there are ways to

00:47:55.940 --> 00:47:59.040
do that, to contribute data.

00:47:59.040 --> 00:48:01.280
And we can talk more about that
offline, if you want.

00:48:01.280 --> 00:48:01.910
AUDIENCE: Great.

00:48:01.910 --> 00:48:05.540
The second question is do
you support LIDAR data?

00:48:05.540 --> 00:48:08.570
REBECCA MOORE: Depends what
you mean by support.

00:48:08.570 --> 00:48:12.370
So LIDAR data, when it's
originally captured, it's this

00:48:12.370 --> 00:48:13.900
3D point cloud.

00:48:13.900 --> 00:48:18.280
But that's often not what people
do the analysis on.

00:48:18.280 --> 00:48:22.290
You can convert that 3D point
cloud into a raster data set.

00:48:22.290 --> 00:48:24.920
And yes, that raster
data set can be

00:48:24.920 --> 00:48:26.630
analyzed in Earth Engine.

00:48:26.630 --> 00:48:27.840
AUDIENCE: So we would need
to convert it to

00:48:27.840 --> 00:48:28.600
the raster data set.

00:48:28.600 --> 00:48:29.150
REBECCA MOORE: Yeah.

00:48:29.150 --> 00:48:29.730
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:48:29.730 --> 00:48:31.720
Thank you.

00:48:31.720 --> 00:48:34.270
REBECCA MOORE: For now.

00:48:34.270 --> 00:48:35.660
AUDIENCE: This is [INAUDIBLE]
from Hong Kong.

00:48:35.660 --> 00:48:37.380
And I would like to know
if there is any

00:48:37.380 --> 00:48:38.970
restriction for NGOs.

00:48:38.970 --> 00:48:41.120
Do they need to reside in
the states or can it be

00:48:41.120 --> 00:48:42.500
all over the world?

00:48:42.500 --> 00:48:43.750
REBECCA MOORE: That's
a great question.

00:48:45.850 --> 00:48:48.520
As we launch Google Earth
Outreach in different

00:48:48.520 --> 00:48:51.690
countries, we need to determine
what constitutes a

00:48:51.690 --> 00:48:54.160
legally registered charity
in that country.

00:48:54.160 --> 00:48:58.520
So for now we've launched in
the US, Brazil, all over

00:48:58.520 --> 00:49:00.870
Europe, all over Africa.

00:49:00.870 --> 00:49:06.350
We have some launches coming
up in Asia later this year.

00:49:06.350 --> 00:49:08.820
But if you go to our Earth
Outreach site, you can see

00:49:08.820 --> 00:49:11.510
which countries were
launched in.

00:49:11.510 --> 00:49:14.650
AUDIENCE: Can this year,
like the coverage

00:49:14.650 --> 00:49:15.700
will cover Hong Kong?

00:49:15.700 --> 00:49:19.460
I cannot go through the
proposal before the

00:49:19.460 --> 00:49:21.620
deadline this year?

00:49:21.620 --> 00:49:22.630
REBECCA MOORE: I'm
sorry, did anyone

00:49:22.630 --> 00:49:23.580
understand the question?

00:49:23.580 --> 00:49:24.110
Can you repeat the question?

00:49:24.110 --> 00:49:24.450
AUDIENCE: Sorry.

00:49:24.450 --> 00:49:28.080
Because you said the deadline
for this year is August 1.

00:49:28.080 --> 00:49:30.700
So if you are not running out in
Hong Kong, then I cannot go

00:49:30.700 --> 00:49:31.470
for this year.

00:49:31.470 --> 00:49:34.760
REBECCA MOORE: Yeah, if you
can be affiliated with a

00:49:34.760 --> 00:49:38.250
nonprofit that is in any of
our currently supported

00:49:38.250 --> 00:49:41.120
countries, that would be
the best approach.

00:49:41.120 --> 00:49:41.480
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:49:41.480 --> 00:49:43.550
Thank you.

00:49:43.550 --> 00:49:47.300
REBECCA MOORE: But next year
there will be more countries.

00:49:47.300 --> 00:49:49.720
OK.

00:49:49.720 --> 00:49:50.970
Any other questions?

00:49:54.960 --> 00:49:55.620
Feel free.

00:49:55.620 --> 00:49:58.290
Don't be shy.

00:49:58.290 --> 00:49:59.145
Yes.

00:49:59.145 --> 00:50:03.720
If you could go to the
mike please, thanks.

00:50:03.720 --> 00:50:06.580
AUDIENCE: Do we come to you at
the booth if we're a nonprofit

00:50:06.580 --> 00:50:08.420
who's interested
in the program?

00:50:08.420 --> 00:50:09.680
REBECCA MOORE: Absolutely.

00:50:09.680 --> 00:50:10.700
Please come talk to us.

00:50:10.700 --> 00:50:15.860
We're happy to give you advice
on which applications are most

00:50:15.860 --> 00:50:19.200
powerful, the kind of things
we're looking for.

00:50:19.200 --> 00:50:22.560
But there's also good guidance
on that online.

00:50:22.560 --> 00:50:22.930
Yes.

00:50:22.930 --> 00:50:24.180
Another question.

00:50:29.090 --> 00:50:30.690
AUDIENCE: A lot of the work
you presented, for obvious

00:50:30.690 --> 00:50:34.310
reasons, is very focused on
environmental issues, except,

00:50:34.310 --> 00:50:37.530
of course, the accessibility
becomes somewhat broader.

00:50:37.530 --> 00:50:41.780
And so in my research life, I'm
a psychology and social

00:50:41.780 --> 00:50:42.550
sciences person.

00:50:42.550 --> 00:50:45.270
And there's all sorts of cool
things I can think to do with

00:50:45.270 --> 00:50:48.810
Maps that isn't so much detailed
satellite analysis.

00:50:48.810 --> 00:50:50.945
But boy, I could think of how
I could incorporate that and

00:50:50.945 --> 00:50:51.630
do something cool.

00:50:51.630 --> 00:50:56.140
So do you get a lot of
connection with non-profits

00:50:56.140 --> 00:50:58.090
that are working outside of
traditional [INAUDIBLE].

00:50:58.090 --> 00:50:58.192
REBECCA MOORE: Yes.

00:50:58.192 --> 00:51:00.570
I mean, I wish we had all day
because there's so many

00:51:00.570 --> 00:51:02.840
applications in the social
science area.

00:51:02.840 --> 00:51:05.440
There's human rights,
humanitarian relief.

00:51:05.440 --> 00:51:08.360
People are doing demographic
studies.

00:51:08.360 --> 00:51:10.700
And if you go to our Earth
Outreach website and you look

00:51:10.700 --> 00:51:13.390
under Success Stories and Case
Studies, you will see a lot of

00:51:13.390 --> 00:51:18.500
examples that are in the social
science area as well.

00:51:18.500 --> 00:51:19.750
Yeah.

00:51:22.760 --> 00:51:24.090
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:51:24.090 --> 00:51:25.340
I'm a developer from Brazil.

00:51:25.340 --> 00:51:27.800
I'm getting the question via
cell phone right now.

00:51:27.800 --> 00:51:28.950
REBECCA MOORE:
[SPEAKING PORTUGUESE]

00:51:28.950 --> 00:51:29.270
AUDIENCE: [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE]

00:51:29.270 --> 00:51:31.010
REBECCA MOORE: Or excuse me,
[SPEAKING PORTUGUESE].

00:51:31.010 --> 00:51:33.460
AUDIENCE: In Brazil it's
[SPEAKING PORTUGUESE], right?

00:51:33.460 --> 00:51:39.310
So my associate is asking if the
NGOs that want to apply to

00:51:39.310 --> 00:51:44.900
this project, they need to be an
old and already established

00:51:44.900 --> 00:51:48.760
NGO, or a brand new NGO
may apply in Brazil?

00:51:48.760 --> 00:51:50.640
REBECCA MOORE: As long as
you're a registered--

00:51:50.640 --> 00:51:52.460
and actually I know
in Brazillian

00:51:52.460 --> 00:51:54.360
Portuguese it's ONG.

00:51:54.360 --> 00:51:55.630
NGO is ONG.

00:51:55.630 --> 00:51:58.730
AUDIENCE: My mind is always
backwards here.

00:51:58.730 --> 00:51:59.460
REBECCA MOORE: Yeah.

00:51:59.460 --> 00:52:01.330
It doesn't matter how
long you've been

00:52:01.330 --> 00:52:03.930
a registered charity.

00:52:03.930 --> 00:52:05.350
You can be new.

00:52:05.350 --> 00:52:05.730
AUDIENCE: Great.

00:52:05.730 --> 00:52:06.980
Thanks a lot.

00:52:09.640 --> 00:52:11.910
REBECCA MOORE: In fact, I will
say that we often find the

00:52:11.910 --> 00:52:16.900
most nimble projects and ideas
are coming from those small,

00:52:16.900 --> 00:52:18.150
small nonprofits.

00:52:20.550 --> 00:52:20.750
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:52:20.750 --> 00:52:25.190
I've been working on something
similar to AXS Map, getting it

00:52:25.190 --> 00:52:27.620
off the ground in
the Netherlands.

00:52:27.620 --> 00:52:31.680
So I definitely want to
talk to you later.

00:52:31.680 --> 00:52:34.330
A question we've been getting
is how to ensure the

00:52:34.330 --> 00:52:35.580
continuity.

00:52:37.500 --> 00:52:41.600
Are you purely grant
dependent?

00:52:41.600 --> 00:52:47.220
Or do you have some way to
get money from users.

00:52:47.220 --> 00:52:49.010
KEVIN BLUER: This is in terms
of profitability?

00:52:49.010 --> 00:52:51.730
Yeah, yeah.

00:52:51.730 --> 00:52:53.910
There's a number models
we've been exploring.

00:52:53.910 --> 00:52:56.830
And we can chat more deeply
offline for sure.

00:52:56.830 --> 00:53:00.220
But yeah, it got kicked
off with the grants.

00:53:00.220 --> 00:53:02.280
And then we've been looking at
some models of sponsored

00:53:02.280 --> 00:53:08.140
venues, featured venues, and
also mapping days where people

00:53:08.140 --> 00:53:09.740
raise money and perhaps--

00:53:09.740 --> 00:53:12.240
like similar to kind of a
walk-a-thon style thing where

00:53:12.240 --> 00:53:12.810
people raise money.

00:53:12.810 --> 00:53:15.460
And some of that, essentially,
that money would go to the

00:53:15.460 --> 00:53:18.050
organization to make it
sustainable as well as

00:53:18.050 --> 00:53:19.870
obviously the other money
going towards

00:53:19.870 --> 00:53:20.850
charities and so on.

00:53:20.850 --> 00:53:25.230
So been exploring a number
of different models.

00:53:25.230 --> 00:53:26.850
REBECCA MOORE: Good questions.

00:53:26.850 --> 00:53:29.550
Yes?

00:53:29.550 --> 00:53:32.120
REBECCA MOORE: Do your grants
touch anything political like

00:53:32.120 --> 00:53:33.370
voter registration?

00:53:35.800 --> 00:53:40.255
REBECCA MOORE: Oh, I might have
to get our grants person.

00:53:40.255 --> 00:53:41.505
Do you know the answer
to that?

00:53:44.160 --> 00:53:47.120
So as long as they're a
registered 501(c)(3).

00:53:47.120 --> 00:53:50.240
And once you're 501(c)(3) that
means you're not doing

00:53:50.240 --> 00:53:52.370
political advocacy, whatever.

00:53:52.370 --> 00:53:53.910
As long as you meet that
criterion, yes.

00:53:53.910 --> 00:53:55.160
You're eligible.

00:53:58.740 --> 00:54:00.070
Thank you Tanya.

00:54:00.070 --> 00:54:01.560
Tanya Birch-- you
should stand up.

00:54:01.560 --> 00:54:04.180
Tanya Birch is a program
manager on Google Earth

00:54:04.180 --> 00:54:07.740
Outreach and she spearheads our
grants program, including

00:54:07.740 --> 00:54:08.990
the developer grants.

00:54:11.770 --> 00:54:13.020
Other questions?

00:54:15.150 --> 00:54:18.830
What are you going to do to
change the world today?

00:54:18.830 --> 00:54:19.340
OK.

00:54:19.340 --> 00:54:19.720
All right.

00:54:19.720 --> 00:54:20.660
Thanks very much, everyone.

00:54:20.660 --> 00:54:22.795
[APPLAUSE]
