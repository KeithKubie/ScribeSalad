&gt;&gt;Cameron Brown: All right,
your thirty seconds...

00:00:09.226 --> 00:00:09.999
Begins right now.

00:00:10.986 --> 00:00:14.766
&gt;&gt;Student: Let's confess the U.S. is
a mess, we are a mess, our country,

00:00:14.766 --> 00:00:17.386
one of the richest and most
successful in the world,

00:00:17.416 --> 00:00:19.976
isn't even on the top twenty
list of healthiest countries.

00:00:20.876 --> 00:00:23.366
&gt;&gt;Student: Our TED Talk is about the
fact that our country needs to step

00:00:23.366 --> 00:00:26.266
up their game and improve themselves,
if we exercise or eat healthier,

00:00:26.296 --> 00:00:29.976
our country can bring themselves
up to the very top of the list.

00:00:30.086 --> 00:00:31.906
&gt;&gt;Cameron Brown: One of the
great things about using missions

00:00:31.906 --> 00:00:35.186
to teach is that students really
get hooked right from the start,

00:00:35.336 --> 00:00:38.576
something that we try to make
really relatable to them.

00:00:38.666 --> 00:00:40.556
I mean it's something that
they can be excited about.

00:00:40.806 --> 00:00:43.506
For example, with my TED mission
that we're working on right now,

00:00:43.736 --> 00:00:46.796
it's giving students a voice to
give their opinion and I think

00:00:46.796 --> 00:00:49.826
at this age it's so important
for students to really think

00:00:49.826 --> 00:00:51.866
about what they believe
in and start to share

00:00:51.866 --> 00:00:52.886
that with people around them.

00:00:58.046 --> 00:00:58.936
&gt;&gt;Student: I think
really the nice part

00:00:58.936 --> 00:01:04.026
about this was we were only
given a general subject.

00:01:04.026 --> 00:01:06.086
We got to pick what we
wanted to do inside it

00:01:06.546 --> 00:01:10.126
and I think that's the really
best way to engage children,

00:01:10.126 --> 00:01:13.956
is to make sure they get
to have their own input.

00:01:13.956 --> 00:01:15.596
'Cause if they don't feel
like they're having an input,

00:01:16.076 --> 00:01:17.096
they're not really interested.

00:01:17.126 --> 00:01:20.656
&gt;&gt;Cameron Brown: To me, my favorite
part about the Quest model is

00:01:20.656 --> 00:01:26.116
that it's so grounded in
skills and real-world topics

00:01:26.546 --> 00:01:28.066
that students are interested in.

00:01:28.066 --> 00:01:31.316
Using a mission throughout
a trimester is a great way

00:01:31.316 --> 00:01:35.056
to not have me stand at the front
of the classroom and say, you know,

00:01:35.056 --> 00:01:37.086
"Today we're gonna talk
about the food pyramid."

00:01:37.406 --> 00:01:39.056
Okay, and we go through
the food groups,

00:01:39.346 --> 00:01:42.126
we talk about each food group,
and there's really no context

00:01:42.386 --> 00:01:45.156
for students to what that
really means to them.

00:01:45.156 --> 00:01:48.906
To them it's-- you know, I find in
a traditional model that's something

00:01:48.906 --> 00:01:51.206
that they would just look at on a
screen, they would take their notes

00:01:51.206 --> 00:01:52.356
on it and then they would move on.

00:01:52.436 --> 00:01:55.636
But integrating the learning into
a mission model that we have here

00:01:55.636 --> 00:01:58.446
at Quest is so important
because we find ways to relate it

00:01:58.446 --> 00:02:00.856
to the students in
their everyday life.

00:02:03.256 --> 00:02:07.106
&gt;&gt;One of the unique aspects
of hosting this TEDx event is

00:02:07.106 --> 00:02:10.916
that the students, they
really take ownership of it.

00:02:11.236 --> 00:02:14.306
Okay? So at the start of the
trimester when we start to talk

00:02:14.306 --> 00:02:17.456
about possible topics and ideas
that they could present about,

00:02:17.826 --> 00:02:19.996
I don't stand up at the front
of the classroom and say,

00:02:20.256 --> 00:02:21.606
"Here's a list of five things.

00:02:21.606 --> 00:02:24.026
You're gonna select one and
you're gonna present on it."

00:02:24.346 --> 00:02:28.946
We work through a series of
lessons where students start

00:02:28.946 --> 00:02:31.666
to identify interests and
passions that they have

00:02:31.926 --> 00:02:33.966
that would be related
to fueling their body.

00:02:35.556 --> 00:02:38.166
&gt;&gt;The presentations are gonna
start in a couple minutes from now?

00:02:38.286 --> 00:02:42.036
So from this point forward I want
you guys to be quiet, Michelle,

00:02:42.716 --> 00:02:45.806
I want you guys to
be quiet and thinking

00:02:45.836 --> 00:02:46.976
about what you're gonna
be saying tonight in your

00:02:47.196 --> 00:02:47.596
presentations.

00:02:47.596 --> 00:02:51.506
You guys put in a lot of hard work
and now this is the pay off, okay?

00:02:51.506 --> 00:02:53.626
So, David, Caleb, let's
do well tonight,

00:02:53.626 --> 00:02:57.966
you guys are gonna do a good job,
so remain in your seats, please.

00:02:58.516 --> 00:03:01.506
&gt;&gt;Within this model as a
teacher it challenges you

00:03:01.506 --> 00:03:02.866
to be a learner as well.

00:03:03.316 --> 00:03:05.936
In a traditional classroom, you
know, you can stand at the front

00:03:05.936 --> 00:03:08.186
with you textbook and this
is what you have to teach.

00:03:08.516 --> 00:03:09.886
But within the Quest
model there's so many

00:03:10.056 --> 00:03:13.816
moving parts and things that are
changing and things you have to adapt

00:03:13.816 --> 00:03:16.396
to and as someone that's
passionate about that, you know,

00:03:16.396 --> 00:03:18.276
we love to get better
at what we're doing.

00:03:18.746 --> 00:03:21.126
So I think that that really
piques a teacher's interest.

00:03:21.226 --> 00:03:25.716
&gt;&gt;And for the second year in the
"Wellness" domain we are excited

00:03:25.716 --> 00:03:27.976
to be hosting TEDxQuestSchool.

00:03:29.046 --> 00:03:29.996
&gt;&gt;Student: I'll admit:
Games are addicting.

00:03:30.056 --> 00:03:32.446
So what I believe we should
do is cut down slowly.

00:03:33.056 --> 00:03:40.226
[laughter] You might want to cut five
or ten minutes a day so you don't,

00:03:40.416 --> 00:03:41.976
like, come off it too quickly.

00:03:43.226 --> 00:03:45.226
[ laughter ]

00:03:45.436 --> 00:03:48.806
&gt;&gt;Student: And then this,
like, meat is, like, all gross.

00:03:49.516 --> 00:03:51.546
[ laughter ]

00:03:52.046 --> 00:03:56.016
&gt;&gt;Student: I have a plan to fix
this, I call it the "Ten-mile Plan,"

00:03:56.016 --> 00:04:00.166
you run at least ten miles
every week and that can be split

00:04:00.486 --> 00:04:01.976
up into a running, biking, or

00:04:02.046 --> 00:04:04.406
swimming. Oy, so I know
what you're thinking,

00:04:04.406 --> 00:04:06.616
"I don't have enough
time to run ten miles."

00:04:06.616 --> 00:04:10.766
Raise your hand if you
have a TV, who has a TV?

00:04:10.766 --> 00:04:14.976
Raise your hand, oy, so if you
don't have time and you have a TV,

00:04:14.976 --> 00:04:16.976
then you obviously do have time
to run, like, two miles a day.

00:04:18.046 --> 00:04:19.976
&gt;&gt;Student: I hope we all fight
for our hope and get help.

00:04:20.516 --> 00:04:21.956
[ applause ]

00:04:22.456 --> 00:04:27.226
&gt;&gt;Student: It was exciting to present
your work to a group of people

00:04:27.226 --> 00:04:28.806
that you've never really
known before,

00:04:29.236 --> 00:04:32.266
but it was nerve-wracking 'cause you
didn't know what they were gonna say

00:04:32.266 --> 00:04:32.816
or react.

00:04:32.956 --> 00:04:35.156
&gt;&gt;Student: We were really
nervous before and, like,

00:04:35.156 --> 00:04:36.036
while we were presenting.

00:04:36.036 --> 00:04:40.896
Like, we were giggling a
bit, but it was really good.

00:04:41.006 --> 00:04:42.176
Like, all the attention was on us.

00:04:42.446 --> 00:04:44.766
&gt;&gt;Cameron Brown: To me, the most
interesting part of this trimester

00:04:44.766 --> 00:04:48.526
and this mission is when
the students find that topic

00:04:48.526 --> 00:04:54.286
that they're interested in and then
they see this TED platform for them

00:04:54.286 --> 00:04:56.516
to voice their ideas on it.

00:04:56.896 --> 00:05:00.366
And when they get that idea and
they're like, "Wow, this is cool

00:05:00.646 --> 00:05:02.276
and I'm sharing it with the world."

00:05:02.626 --> 00:05:04.886
You know, I was looking on
the TED website yesterday

00:05:05.166 --> 00:05:08.716
and they're approaching their
one-billionth view of their talks.

00:05:09.096 --> 00:05:11.746
So this is a massive
platform and I think

00:05:11.926 --> 00:05:16.106
when the students find what it is
and they start working towards being

00:05:16.106 --> 00:05:18.846
on this website, it's
an amazing thing.
