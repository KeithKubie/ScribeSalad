00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.760
Hi, I'm John Green, this is Crash Course World
History, and today we're going to talk about

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:07.160
our old friend trade and also corporations.

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:13.179
Oh great, another Marxist rant from my union-loving
public school teacher about how capitalism

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:14.559
is destroying the world.

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:18.999
You know, Me from the Past, all the capitalists
call me Marxist, all the Marxists call me

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.980
capitalist, I--I can't win!

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:25.439
Here's the thing, Me from the Past, I am grateful
that there is a market for people to, you

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:30.060
know, sell books and make YouTube videos,
and capitalism does a pretty good job of making

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.359
goods and services available to large groups
of people.

00:00:34.359 --> 00:00:38.719
Plus how else am I going to turn sweat of
the proletariat into delicious Diet Dr. Pepper?

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.040
(Not a sponsor. I wish they were a sponsor.)

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.620
I'll tell you what, Me from the Past, I've
enjoyed a cup or two of the sweat of the proletariat

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:48.940
over the years and it just doesn't have that
carbonated "pop" of Diet Dr. Pepper.

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:54.120
What were we talking about? Oh right, capitalism.
I like capitalism, what I don't like are monopolies

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:59.249
and violence, and those are both aspects of
one of the first capitalist enterprises and

00:00:59.249 --> 00:01:04.329
the subject of today's episode, the Vereenigde
Oostindische Compagnie (and I will remind

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:06.420
you that mispronouncing things is my thing).

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.420
In English of course that's the Dutch East
India Company. I'd like to use the Dutch,

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:14.500
though, but I can't pronounce it, so we're
just gonna compromise and call it the VOC.

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:27.160
So you probably remember from our first series
that trade in the Indian Ocean had gone along

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:31.940
swimmingly for hundreds of years until the
Portuguese tried and failed to dominate it

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:33.620
in the 15th and 16th centuries.

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:37.399
And you may also remember that in between
the Portuguese and the massively powerful

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:41.039
British Empire there was another European
power: the Dutch.

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:46.039
At the time, the Netherlands was a country
of 1.5 million people, about as many people

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:49.710
as currently live in Greater Indianapolis.
Now, admittedly, they'd already accomplished

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.460
some impressive things, for instance, they'd
dug most of their country out from the ocean,

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.969
but how they came to thoroughly dominate world
trade for fifty years tells us a lot about

00:01:58.969 --> 00:02:02.440
capitalism, technology, and also, violence.

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:06.700
I suppose we could start with the revolt of
the United Provinces in the union of Utrecht

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:11.720
in 1579, which created the Netherlands, or
perhaps the decision by the Catholic Duke

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:17.830
of Parma in 1585 to let Protestants leave
captured Antwerp and set up shop in Amsterdam,

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:23.470
or we could start in 1595 with the creation
of the first Amsterdam-based investment syndicate,

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:27.010
The Company for Far Lands, which is what I
call my Minecraft server.

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:31.750
So the founder of The Company for Far Lands
published this report called the Itinerario

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:36.970
that excited dreams of vast wealth and spices
from South-east Asia. There's a key passage

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.439
in the report that explains the riches available
in the islands east of Malacca:

00:02:41.439 --> 00:02:47.019
"In this place of Sunda there is much pepper,
and it is better than that of India or Malabar,

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:53.780
whereof there is so great quantity that they
could lade yearly from thence 500,000 pounds.

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:59.260
It hath likewise much frankincense, camphor,
and diamonds, to which men might very well

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:04.739
traffic without much impeachment, for that
the Portugals come not thither, because great

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:09.499
numbers of Java come themselves unto Malacca
to sell their wares."

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:14.140
You'll note there that the initial idea was
to break into this already existing trade

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:18.709
system and displace the Portugals. So in the
same way that trade in the western Indian

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:23.060
Ocean was flourishing before the arrival of
the Europeans, the South China Sea region

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:27.440
and eastern Indian Ocean was a trade hot-bed,
perhaps even more valuable because of the

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:31.440
riches of China. And it seems that the Dutch
originally planned to try to break into that

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:36.180
existing trade network on equal terms, like,
according to Jacob Van Neck, the captain of

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:40.730
the first successful expedition to Indonesia,
the plan was, quote, "not to rob anyone of

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:45.150
their property, but to trade uprightly with
all foreign nations."

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:50.700
But pretty soon that idea of free trade gave
way to the hard reality that competition meant,

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:56.030
you know, lower prices, and by 1601 there
were enough successful trade companies that

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:00.530
the cost of buying spices in Indonesia was
going up, and also there was suddenly tons

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:03.879
of pepper in Amsterdam, which meant the price
that could be charged for that pepper was

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:08.280
going down; clearly, something had to be done.
Ideally that something would have been lower

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:13.840
prices for everyone, and an efficient marketplace, but
the something that happened instead was the VOC.

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:15.440
Let's go to the Thought Bubble.

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:20.480
In 1601, the United Provinces, aka the Netherlands,
were governed nationally by a representative

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:25.250
body that met at the Hague, called the States
General, although each of the individual provinces

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:29.570
was largely self-governing, and the leader
of the States General was able to convince

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:35.780
all the provinces to accept a single entity to
monopolize the East Indies trade. This new

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:41.880
company, the VOC, was run by a seventeen-member
board called the Heeren XVII, and these directors

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:46.730
supposedly had control over a company that
was chartered with the power to hire its own

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:48.970
people, and also to wage war.

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:53.140
I say supposedly because, you know, it took
a year for communications from the Netherlands

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:58.140
to reach the East Indies, and another year
for company officers to respond, so the VOC

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:02.780
basically operated as its own sovereign nation,
with the power to use as much violence as

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:07.350
it needed to build and maintain its trading
power, like according to author Stephen Bown,

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:11.120
"The VOC would essentially operate as a state
within a state."

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:15.890
And the VOC, together with its sister company
the West India Company, did use violence,

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:20.680
attacking Portuguese and Spanish settlements
in Chile, Brazil, East and West Africa, the

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:26.180
Persian Gulf, India, Sri Lanka, Indonesia,
China and the Philippines between 1602 and

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:30.920
1663, in what you could think of as an early
world war.

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:36.300
The VOC was also different from a lot of corporations
because it was initially funded with 6.5 million

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:41.880
guilders, about 100 million dollars in today's
money. And that capital was expected to fund

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:47.990
business ventures for a long time going forward
-- not just for like one initial trade mission.

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:52.940
And this long-term business thinking was unique,
especially compared to the funding strategies

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:58.360
of the VOC's biggest competitor, the British
East India Company, and it reflected the advanced

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:01.080
financial acumen of the Dutch model generally.

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:02.230
Thanks, Thought Bubble.

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:06.320
So, we've got this company that's basically
also a country. But it's not a particularly

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:10.360
good country, because it doesn't have, like,
any of the responsibilities of government,

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:14.960
nor does it have to answer to the people it's
governing. All it has to do is make money.

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:20.140
And it was really good at making money, like
by 1648 the United Provinces were in better

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:23.040
financial shape than every other nation in
Europe.

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:26.700
You can tell this partly just by looking at
interest rates. Now admittedly, interest rates

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:31.120
are only one measure of financial health and
power, but they're an important indicator,

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:36.760
even today. So, Dutch businesses could borrow
at a rate of 4 percent annual interest, and

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:40.760
that's pretty cheap compared to the 10 percent
it cost corporations to borrow money in England

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:45.830
or the 24.99 percent it cost me to borrow
money on my credit card. And because Dutch

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:50.050
debt was so much cheaper, they could invest
two and a half times as much in pretty much

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:54.760
anything than the English could, including,
like, an army and a navy, and this gave the

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:57.200
Dutch a huge head start over their rivals.

00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:00.560
So one reason the interest rates were low
is because the companies were healthy and

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:05.180
they tended to pay people back. But another
is that normal Dutch people were already used

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:10.120
to investing their money in bonds that had
been issued for land reclamation projects,

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:14.900
the famous dykes and windmills that turned
land below sea level into fields where you

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:18.230
could grow tulips, or maybe something else,
but all they ever grow is tulips.

00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:22.590
Like according to business historian William
Bernstein, the tradition of investing in bonds,

00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:28.430
quote "carried over into trade: after 1600
Dutch citizens would consider it just as natural

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:32.790
to own a fractional share in a trading vessel
to the Baltic or the Spice Islands."

00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:37.600
And a fractional share is another really interesting
idea embraced by the Dutch, that allowed merchants

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:42.990
to bear greater risks by purchasing smaller
percentage shares in business ventures. Like,

00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:47.940
it's much better to own a tenth of ten ships
than it is to own all of one ship, because

00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:53.650
the loss of a single trading ship won't, like, ruin you.
And Dutch business people also enthusiastically

00:07:53.650 --> 00:07:58.360
invested in futures markets, guessing what
the price of pepper would be six months or

00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:02.630
a year from now, and they created new financial
instruments that could be bought and sold,

00:08:02.630 --> 00:08:06.960
and merchants purchased maritime insurance,
which further lowered their risk. And lower

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:11.930
risk means you could invest more of your capital
until eventually you have a completely efficient

00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:14.020
market and everything is perfect

00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:15.780
--until the 2008 crash.

00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:17.270
Wait, what were we talking about?

00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:21.560
The Dutch financial system and its corporations
were simply better than their competitors,

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:25.040
and that's why they seized the lion's share
of the trading business

00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:26.680
-- but that isn't the whole story.

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:32.240
Like, one reason the VOC was so successful
was government sponsorship and centralization.

00:08:32.250 --> 00:08:36.560
The VOC had been chartered by the States General,
and it could count on the Dutch government

00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:39.279
to back it up with money and military support.

00:08:39.279 --> 00:08:42.300
There's another benefit to being sponsored
by your government, which is that it's very

00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:46.660
hard for competition to emerge, because it
isn't sponsored by your government. For instance,

00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:51.220
in Indonesia the VOC had a single governor
general managing operations, while the British

00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:55.730
East India Company was more of like a collection
of trading posts, each competing with each

00:08:55.730 --> 00:09:00.310
other for a share of the spices. Competition
may bring down prices for consumers, but it

00:09:00.310 --> 00:09:02.740
also brings down profits for businesses.

00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:08.170
In 1605, the VOC realized that if it really
wanted to maximize its profits, it would need

00:09:08.170 --> 00:09:12.990
a monopoly of the world's spice trade, and
to do that, they would need permanent bases

00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:17.529
in Indonesia. Initially, they got spices by
trading for them with the people who grew

00:09:17.529 --> 00:09:21.709
them, especially with the inhabitants of the
Banda Islands, which was the only place where

00:09:21.709 --> 00:09:26.649
nutmeg was grown. But again, like, trading
in a fair and equitable manner is no way to

00:09:26.649 --> 00:09:27.920
maximize profits.

00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:32.149
So at first the Bandinese welcomed the Dutch,
because they were much more laid-back in terms

00:09:32.149 --> 00:09:36.259
of religion than the Portuguese, but very
quickly the Dutch tricked them into signing

00:09:36.259 --> 00:09:40.420
exclusive trade agreements, which the Bandinese
were almost certain to violate, and then when

00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:43.449
they did violate them, ehh, it didn't go well.

00:09:43.449 --> 00:09:46.910
In 1609 the Bandinese were like, "No, you
don't understand, like, we need trade for

00:09:46.910 --> 00:09:52.129
food," and the Dutch were like, "But you promised!",
and the islanders killed 47 Dutch soldiers

00:09:52.129 --> 00:09:54.560
and officers in the ensuing fight.

00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:58.980
The Dutch killed far more Bandinese, who were
eventually subdued and agreed to a nutmeg

00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:02.290
monopoly with the Dutch, although they continued
to secretly trade with the English.

00:10:02.290 --> 00:10:08.400
And after all this, by 1612, Jan Pieterszoon
Coen became the dominant force in Dutch Indonesia.

00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:12.579
He was an accountant by training, but also
a ruthless military leader, who is largely

00:10:12.579 --> 00:10:17.329
responsible for the Dutch monopoly of the
spice trade, and also for its really terrible

00:10:17.329 --> 00:10:21.889
relations with the British, and also for,
like, you know, certain crimes against humanity.

00:10:21.889 --> 00:10:27.019
Coen brought about the shift in VOC policy,
away from straightforward trade and toward

00:10:27.019 --> 00:10:32.769
monopoly of both shipping and production of
spices. He also made it clear that this trade

00:10:32.769 --> 00:10:35.149
needed to be based on military force.

00:10:35.149 --> 00:10:40.230
He wrote, "Your Honors should know by experience
that trade in Asia must be driven and maintained

00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:44.970
under the protection and favor of your Honors'
own weapons, and that the weapons must be

00:10:44.970 --> 00:10:50.710
paid for by the profits from the trade, so
that we cannot carry on trade without war,

00:10:50.710 --> 00:10:52.480
nor war without trade."

00:10:52.490 --> 00:10:56.769
There is no trade without war, nor war without
trade -- that's something to think about.

00:10:56.769 --> 00:11:00.579
Anyway, Coen did make a lot of war, mostly
on the English, despite the fact that the

00:11:00.579 --> 00:11:05.800
Netherlands and England were engaged in trade
negotiations between 1613 and 1619.

00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:10.170
And in fact fighting between the VOC and the
English continued even after an agreement

00:11:10.170 --> 00:11:14.879
was signed. By using force, which included
capturing and torturing English traders, Coen

00:11:14.879 --> 00:11:20.149
was able to run off the English and secure
the VOC monopoly over the spice trade.

00:11:20.149 --> 00:11:24.060
With the English out of the picture, Coen
could get down to the business of using violence

00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:29.120
to dominate not only the trade, but also the
production of spices. His initial plan, to

00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:33.779
quote Stephen Bown, was to depopulate the
island to replace their inhabitants with imported

00:11:33.779 --> 00:11:39.259
slave and indentured labor under VOC control,
and he proceeded to carry out what amounted

00:11:39.259 --> 00:11:41.899
to ethnic cleansing of the Banda Islands.

00:11:41.899 --> 00:11:47.939
In about 20 years, the Dutch managed to acquire
an almost complete monopoly on cloves, nutmeg,

00:11:47.939 --> 00:11:53.889
and mace. In 1658, they added cinnamon by
taking control of Sri Lanka. And, after 1638,

00:11:53.889 --> 00:11:58.009
they became the only Europeans allowed to
trade in Japan. Now, we tend to think that

00:11:58.009 --> 00:12:02.789
the heart of the spice trade was between Indonesia
and Europe, but it really wasn't. Like, the

00:12:02.789 --> 00:12:08.079
VOC capital at Batavia became the most important
port in all of Southeast Asia, where spices

00:12:08.079 --> 00:12:13.600
from Indonesia and gold and copper and silver
from Japan and tea and porcelain and silk

00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:18.209
from China all passed through to India, where
they were traded for cotton, which was used

00:12:18.209 --> 00:12:19.850
to buy more Asian goods.

00:12:19.850 --> 00:12:23.839
And that was the real money-maker for the
VOC. By the middle of the 17th century, only

00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:28.280
the highest-value luxury goods from the region
even made it to Europe, because that's where

00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:29.560
the margins were the highest.

00:12:29.580 --> 00:12:33.740
So the middle of the 17th century was the
golden age for the Dutch; it was the one the

00:12:33.740 --> 00:12:38.610
brought us Rembrandt and Ver Meer as well
as all the wealth and finery that was depicted

00:12:38.610 --> 00:12:42.910
in their paintings. When you go to Amsterdam,
which you should, and you walk along the canals

00:12:42.910 --> 00:12:47.870
and see the beautiful row houses, you'll note
that many of them were built in the 17th century.

00:12:47.870 --> 00:12:52.460
And much of that was based on the success
of the VOC and the commerce in spices, but

00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:56.730
eventually Europeans' tastes changed, and
the desire for nutmeg was supplanted by

00:12:56.730 --> 00:12:58.180
a hunger for sugar.

00:12:58.180 --> 00:13:01.640
Of course, the sugar trade would be known
for its righteousness and fair trade -- just

00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:06.360
kidding, it would be known for slavery. Also the woolens
produced by the Dutch were being replaced by

00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:11.460
the market for cotton. Britain proved better positioned
to dominate the trade in production in these new

00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:15.700
and more profitable commodities, and they
eventually copied the centralized

00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:20.580
corporate governance and finance capitalism
that had helped make the VOC so successful.

00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:26.260
According to Stephen Bown, "Ultimately, maintaining
the monopoly cost more than the spices were worth,"

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:29.100
and the company went bankrupt in 1799.

00:13:29.110 --> 00:13:33.769
So the VOC were pioneers of finance and their
relentless pursuit of profits made them the

00:13:33.769 --> 00:13:38.480
richest company in the 17th century, but we
need to be careful about celebrating them

00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:42.670
as like a harbinger of modern capitalism.
For one thing, it wouldn't have succeeded

00:13:42.670 --> 00:13:47.869
without government support, especially if
it had engaged just in free trade. The VOC

00:13:47.869 --> 00:13:53.579
had an army and a navy that it used to attack
and intimidate, which is, you know, not free trade.

00:13:53.579 --> 00:13:56.990
I think there's a lot to take away from the
story of the VOC. One thing that I like to

00:13:56.990 --> 00:14:01.709
remember is that this was all about nutmeg.
We need to think carefully about what we value

00:14:01.709 --> 00:14:07.660
and why we value it and what we lose by valuing
it, in the same way that I kind of wish people

00:14:07.660 --> 00:14:12.509
in Europe had about nutmeg in the 17th century.
And the second thing is that the VOC did eventually

00:14:12.509 --> 00:14:18.629
disappear and its control over Indonesia changed
into Dutch colonization, the VOC provides

00:14:18.629 --> 00:14:25.349
a chilling example of what has happened in the past
when corporations become more powerful than states.

00:14:25.349 --> 00:14:30.600
Good governments fulfill their responsibilities
to the people they govern, and even bad governments,

00:14:30.610 --> 00:14:35.220
you know, are afraid of the people they govern,
and neither of those things happened in Indonesia

00:14:35.220 --> 00:14:38.100
when it was under the control of the Dutch
East India Company.

00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:40.220
Thanks for watching. I'll see you next week.

00:14:40.220 --> 00:14:44.249
