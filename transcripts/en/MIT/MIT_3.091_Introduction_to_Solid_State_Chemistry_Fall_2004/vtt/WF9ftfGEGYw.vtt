00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:37.466
Let's get started.
One announcement. And that is that

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.000
a reminder about the celebration of
learning on Wednesday,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.000
October 2nd, Test 2. It will have
coverage spanning lectures 7 through

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.000
17. The new material that I am
going to introduce today will not be

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.000
covered, but certainly this little
review is worthwhile.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:54.280
And going back to 7 with the
beginning of ionics.

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.570
What I wanted to do today was just
set the stage and briefly review

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:02.850
where we were last day where we
looked at the emission spectrum of a

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.140
target in an x-ray tube.
Here I have plotted intensity

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.420
versus wavelength.
Long wavelength is low energy.

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.710
Energy is increasing from right to
left. And what we see is a family

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:35.020
of nested curves each taking a
different plate voltage.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:24.120
Low voltage gives us low intensity.
High voltage gives us high

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:28.240
intensity. We see this whale-shaped
background which we refer to as the

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.370
continuous spectrum or
"bremsstrahlung.

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:36.490
And then once we reach a critical
voltage beyond which we start to see

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:40.620
this second set of lines here,
which I have indicated in fuchsia.

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:44.740
And this is the characteristic
spectrum, and it is quantized.

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:48.870
It is not continuous. We have
discrete values of wavelength

00:01:48.870 --> 00:02:08.206
associated with energy transitions
within the target.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:57.460
And those transitions are prompted
by the ejection of inner shell

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:01.920
electrons. And that does not occur
until you get to a certain critical

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.380
plate voltage which translates into
a certain critical ballistic energy

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.840
on the part of the incident
electrons. And there are a few

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.300
features here that we can point out.
The various discrete wavelengths of

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.760
the characteristic spectrum are
calculable, the k alpha

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.150
and the l alpha.
Lines are calculable by Mosley's law,

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.460
which is given here,
where the nf and ni are associated

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:32.760
with a particular transition.
For k lines it is the transition

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.070
from two to one.
And screening factor is one for the

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:41.380
k alpha transition.
For the l alpha transition it is

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:45.690
from three to two.
And the screening factor in that

00:02:45.690 --> 00:03:04.780
case is 7.4. We can calculate these
discrete values.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:54.250
And the other point that we can
calculate on this curve is the

00:02:54.250 --> 00:03:14.200
leading edge of the continuous
spectrum. The leading edge of the

00:02:38.500 --> 00:03:02.750
continuous spectrum is designated
here as the shortest wavelength,

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:22.833
which obviously is the highest
energy. And that derives from total

00:02:47.000 --> 00:03:11.250
transfer of incident ballistic
energy of the electron to photon and

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:30.933
capture of the electron.
And that is the shortest wavelength

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:19.750
given by the Duane-Hunt law which is
12,400 over the plate voltage giving

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:38.033
you a value of wavelength
in angstroms.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:29.090
I think we are ready now to probe
atomic arrangement with x-rays.

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:34.180
And, in order to do so, we are
going to rely on two important

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:39.270
factors. First of all,
we are going to model the crystal as

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:44.360
an array of mirrors.
In other words, we are going to

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:49.450
look at the atoms in the crystal and
consider each atom as

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:55.660
acting as a mirror.
This will give us features that we

00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:02.990
can exploit in a very simple model.
Let's model atoms as mirrors. And

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:10.330
that is going to allow us to use the
laws of specular reflection.

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:17.660
And the one that we most critically
rely on is that the angle of

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:32.986
incidence equals the
angle of reflection.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.800
That is the first thing that we use.
And then the second thing that we

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:16.600
use is interference criteria.
We are going to apply interference

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:22.400
criteria. Let's take a look at what
we mean by that.

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:28.200
We have two possibilities.
We can have multiple beams coming

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:34.000
in phase or we can have multiple
beams coming out of phase.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.200
And so here is what we talk about.
I am going to show a little sketch

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:44.400
where I am plotting amplitude.
This is some electromagnetic signal.

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:49.600
Amplitude versus time.
Let's look at two rays.

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:54.800
Here is one. This is amplitude
versus time. And the second one,

00:04:54.800 --> 00:05:00.000
in phase. I am going to draw it
directly beneath.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:24.900
And so the crests line up,
the troughs line up. If I take ray

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:29.810
one plus ray two,
I am going to add them.

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:34.720
And I will get the intensification,
the additive sum of amplitude

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:39.630
because they are in phase.
This is called in phase radiation

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:44.540
summing. Or the other term applied
to this is constructive

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:57.080
interference.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:38.000
That is the one extreme.
The other extreme is totally out of

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.000
phase. In that case,
ray one I will draw as I did before,

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:48.000
but ray two I will draw
symmetrically opposite so that in

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:53.000
ray two the crest of ray two aligns
with the trough of ray one.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:58.000
The trough of ray two aligns with
the crest of ray one.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:23.390
And, for argument's sake,
let's say that these are equal in

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:28.790
amplitude. If I have two rays equal
in amplitude and they interfere but

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:34.190
they are perfectly out of phase,
if I add these two signals what I

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:39.590
will get is nothing.
They will cancel. Complete

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:57.713
cancellation. This is called
destructive interference.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:52.660
And those are the only two

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:57.990
principles we need.
And we can describe at a very

00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:03.330
reasonable level what is going on
inside a crystal which is being

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:08.660
irradiated by electromagnetic
radiation in the x region of the

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:13.990
spectrum. That is all I am going to
use are these two ideas.

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:19.330
Let's now go to a simple model here
of a crystal. We will

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:25.250
draw some atoms here.
Here is the top plane.

00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:31.750
Let's go down a second.
And I will make this cubic.

00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:38.250
Here are two planes of atoms.
And let's say I have incident light

00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:44.750
coming in at some angle theta.
One ray I am showing striking this

00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:50.280
atom.
And if I observe the laws of

00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:54.850
specular reflection,
this will reflect from the mirror at

00:07:54.850 --> 00:07:59.420
the identical angle.
The angle of reflection equals the

00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:03.990
angle of incidence.
And let's put a second ray coming

00:08:03.990 --> 00:08:08.570
down here. And it,
too, will reflect at the same angle

00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:13.140
and come out like so.
Oh, there is a cell phone.

00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:17.710
Somebody is leaving the room.
Let's go. I want the cell phones

00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:23.120
off. No compromises.
Show some respect for your

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:29.370
classmates. It is rude.
It is disrespectful to me.

00:08:29.370 --> 00:08:35.620
It's disrespectful to the class.
You don't get it. If that happens

00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:41.870
on Wednesday, I will tear up your
paper in front of your eyes and give

00:08:41.870 --> 00:08:55.473
you a zero. Mark my words.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:35.000
I want to look at what happens when
I have light coming in at a

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:40.000
particular angle.
And, furthermore,

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:45.000
I want to specify that I have in
phase radiation which is also termed

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:50.000
coherent. I have in phase incident
coherent radiation.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:55.000
And, furthermore, I want it
monochromatic.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:00.000
These are x-rays that are coherent
and monochromatic.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:25.450
Monochromatic means a single
wavelength. Here is the incident

00:09:25.450 --> 00:09:30.900
radiation on the left,
and this is the reflected radiation

00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:36.360
on the right. And what do I want to
see here? I want to see what the

00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:41.810
conditions are to give me
constructive interference because I

00:09:41.810 --> 00:09:47.270
don't want destructive interference.
If I have destructive interference

00:09:47.270 --> 00:09:52.300
I won't see anything.
Let's mark this by showing some kind

00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:56.920
of a waveform.
What I will do is show just the

00:09:56.920 --> 00:10:01.530
first sinusoid,
and then I will show the same on the

00:10:01.530 --> 00:10:06.150
second ray. What I am trying to
indicate is that I have in phase

00:10:06.150 --> 00:10:10.760
radiation coming down from the left.
And then over here I want to

00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:15.380
indicate that I have in phase
radiation leaving.

00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:34.560
Again, I will indicate the
sinusoids in the same position.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:25.380
There is an issue here.
You can see ray one travels a

00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:30.760
shorter distance than ray two.
Ray two has to go farther. I can

00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:36.150
actually calculate how far that is.
If I drop a normal from here and a

00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:41.530
normal from here,
I can label this A,

00:10:41.530 --> 00:10:46.920
B and C. And we can see that ray
two has to travel a farther distance,

00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:52.300
AB plus BC. And what is the
condition of AB plus BC to ensure

00:10:52.300 --> 00:11:11.300
that these two are in phase?
They must equal some path length

00:10:37.300 --> 00:11:01.890
that is a whole number of
wavelengths. Otherwise,

00:11:01.890 --> 00:11:06.490
I will get some amount of
destructive interference.

00:11:06.490 --> 00:11:11.090
And n, of course, is a whole number.
I don't care.

00:11:11.090 --> 00:11:15.690
It's one, two and so on.
Actually, we can call this the

00:11:15.690 --> 00:11:20.530
order of the reflection.
And if I go through the math,

00:11:20.530 --> 00:11:25.610
we know what theta is. What is this
distance between successive planes?

00:11:25.610 --> 00:11:30.690
If I am showing you adjacent hkl
planes then this distance here is d,

00:11:30.690 --> 00:11:35.760
as we have defined it before. This
is the distance between adjacent hkl

00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:40.840
planes. And, if I go through the
trigonometry here,

00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:45.920
n lambda will equal two times d sine
of theta. We've got the angle theta.

00:11:45.920 --> 00:12:03.906
We know the distance between
successive planes.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:58.250
If n lambda equals 2 d sine theta,
this path length will be such that

00:11:58.250 --> 00:12:15.866
constructive interference will occur,
in phase radiation will be reflected

00:11:45.500 --> 00:12:12.750
as such, and this is called Bragg's
Law. It is the condition for

00:12:12.750 --> 00:12:28.033
constructive interference
in a crystal.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:26.660
And, in 3.091,
what we are going to do is neglect

00:12:26.660 --> 00:12:33.330
higher order reflections.
In 3.091, we neglect higher order

00:12:33.330 --> 00:12:39.990
reflections. Let's just put n
equals one. Bragg's Law for 3.

00:12:39.990 --> 00:12:46.660
91 will simply be lambda equals 2 d
sine theta. That is

00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:52.410
the Bragg condition.
Suppose I have a new system and I

00:12:52.410 --> 00:12:57.240
find that I have now atoms here.
Let's say I go from a simple cubic

00:12:57.240 --> 00:13:02.080
to a body-centered cubic.
Well, in body-centered cubic there

00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:06.910
are atoms here.
I know they are on a different

00:13:06.910 --> 00:13:11.740
plane relative to the board,
but relative to the horizontal there

00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:16.580
is a plane of atoms at this location.
Let's see what happens

00:13:16.580 --> 00:13:21.580
in this case.
In this case, if I have a third ray

00:13:21.580 --> 00:13:26.740
that comes in,
let's call it ray three,

00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:31.910
and ray three also is in phase with
ray one and ray two,

00:13:31.910 --> 00:13:37.080
this is the reflected ray three,
I can define the additional path

00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:42.240
length of ray three as DEF.
And what we see is that it turns

00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:47.410
out then that DE plus EF,
if n equals one, this is going to be

00:13:47.410 --> 00:13:54.280
one-half a wavelength.
If AB plus BC is one wavelength,

00:13:54.280 --> 00:14:02.850
this is one-half wavelength. And
what that means is that the

00:14:02.850 --> 00:14:11.420
reflected ray three is perfectly out
of phase with rays one and two.

00:14:11.420 --> 00:14:26.506
That means we are going to get
destructive interference.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:30.830
And that means,

00:14:30.830 --> 00:14:38.490
if we park a detector right here,
we will measure zero intensity. We

00:14:38.490 --> 00:14:46.160
measure zero intensity at that angle.
Now what I want to do is generalize

00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:54.280
what we have observed here.
I want to generalize this analysis.

00:14:54.280 --> 00:15:02.850
And, if I generalize this analysis,
what I get is that if I take the

00:15:02.850 --> 00:15:11.420
interference criterion and combine
it with the crystal structure,

00:15:11.420 --> 00:15:27.306
what does that give me? It gives me
the set of expected reflections.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:32.660
And so, in essence,

00:15:32.660 --> 00:15:37.990
this is a fingerprint of the crystal
structure. It is not a fingerprint

00:15:37.990 --> 00:15:43.330
of the chemical identity.
It does not say anything about

00:15:43.330 --> 00:15:48.660
identity, but any crystal structure
of this description will give the

00:15:48.660 --> 00:16:05.786
reflections at the same
set of angles.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:42.000
Any crystal structure of this
description will give no reflections

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:50.000
at the same set of angles.
This, for example, will show you

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:58.000
what would happen in the case of
{001}. {001} we saw reflects in

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:06.000
simple cubic at the given
angle theta 001.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:33.710
But it does not reflect in
body-centered cubic at theta 001.

00:16:33.710 --> 00:16:41.420
Because in body-centered cubic
there are atoms at {002}.

00:16:41.420 --> 00:16:49.140
And atoms at {002} will be totally
out of phase with the reflection

00:16:49.140 --> 00:17:05.480
that is coming off of {001}.
We will see no reflection at {001}.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:45.000
Likewise, with FCC. FCC also has
atoms at the midpoint on each face.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:53.000
It does not reflect in BCC and FCC,
both of them. Now I can start to

00:16:53.000 --> 00:17:01.000
distinguish which are which.
And now let's take a look at some

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:27.080
opportunity to make sense of this.
Here is just a figure that I took

00:17:27.080 --> 00:17:31.240
from one of the texts just showing
what I have drawn on the board.

00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:35.410
I think we can zoom through this.
Now this is on the handout. This

00:17:35.410 --> 00:17:39.580
is the selection rules for
reflection in cubic crystals.

00:17:39.580 --> 00:17:43.740
What has happened here is that the
geometric analysis along these lines

00:17:43.740 --> 00:17:47.910
has been performed taking into
account the atom positions.

00:17:47.910 --> 00:18:06.653
And what do we see?
We see that simple cubic we get

00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:37.500
reflections at every plane,
at every index. Body-centered cubic

00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:42.500
is not reflecting the {100},
because we have shown already that

00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:47.500
the reflection from {200} at that
angle is perfectly out of phase.

00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:52.500
The computations have been done.
And, likewise, FCC. This is

00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:57.500
indicating that you won't see a
{100} reflection in face-centered

00:17:57.500 --> 00:18:22.060
cubic or body-centered cubic.
Then we go down to {011},

00:18:22.060 --> 00:18:26.180
simple cubic reflects, body-centered
cubic reflects,

00:18:26.180 --> 00:18:30.310
but face-centered cubic does not
reflect. You cannot look at any

00:18:30.310 --> 00:18:34.430
single line. You have to look at
the entire pattern and so on.

00:18:34.430 --> 00:18:38.550
And there is a simple way of
codifying all of this.

00:18:38.550 --> 00:18:42.680
Simple cubic, all of the indices
are reflecting.

00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:46.810
In body-centered cubic,
if you go through this pattern,

00:18:46.810 --> 00:18:50.930
what we are looking at is the sum of
h squared plus k squared

00:18:50.930 --> 00:18:55.160
plus l squared.
And that gives you a nice sequence,

00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:59.490
one, two, three, four, five and so
on. And what you see with BCC is

00:18:59.490 --> 00:19:03.830
you have the sequence two,
four, six, eight, ten. The sum of h

00:19:03.830 --> 00:19:08.160
plus k plus l is even.
That is a way of capturing what is

00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:12.490
going on in this series.
And for face-centered cubic,

00:19:12.490 --> 00:19:16.830
it turns out that the planes that
reflect are either all even numbers

00:19:16.830 --> 00:19:21.580
or all odd numbers.
For example, face-centered cubic,

00:19:21.580 --> 00:19:26.740
you see {111}. Those are all odd.
{200}. Zero is termed in this

00:19:26.740 --> 00:19:31.910
calculation as being an even number.
Two is even, zero is even and zero

00:19:31.910 --> 00:19:37.080
is even. Three and four reflect.
Five and six do not. Eight does.

00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:42.240
That is {220} and so on, eight,
eleven, twelve,

00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:47.410
sixteen. This is a set of selection
criteria that have been tabulated

00:19:47.410 --> 00:19:52.660
for your convenience.
And now what we can do is go into

00:19:52.660 --> 00:19:57.990
some example using this technique in
order to index a crystal.

00:19:57.990 --> 00:20:03.330
And so I want to show you two
different techniques that allow us

00:20:03.330 --> 00:20:15.993
to determine the crystal structure.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:20:18.590
The first one is called
diffractometry.

00:20:18.590 --> 00:20:24.190
And since it is done with x-rays,
it is also known as x-ray

00:20:24.190 --> 00:20:29.200
diffraction, XRD.
And the characteristics of x-ray

00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:33.600
diffraction are we use radiation of
fixed wavelength and we vary the

00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:52.400
angle, variable angle.
Look at this cartoon here.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:42.400
If we have fixed wavelength and we
are varying the angle,

00:20:42.400 --> 00:21:02.333
I am going to be moving the crystal.
This is how I am going to get

00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:51.380
variable angle.
What I am saying is variable angle

00:20:51.380 --> 00:20:56.150
of incidence. In other words,
I want to probe all of the incident

00:20:56.150 --> 00:21:00.920
angles and build a library of
responses. For a given incidence

00:21:00.920 --> 00:21:05.690
angle, what is the intensity of the
reflected radiation?

00:21:05.690 --> 00:21:10.460
The way I do that is to park the
beam and rotate the specimen.

00:21:10.460 --> 00:21:15.230
Ultimately, I end up with a plot
that looks like this.

00:21:15.230 --> 00:21:33.793
Intensity versus angle.
This is angle of reflected.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:24.370
Now we are going to decide if the
pattern we observe conforms to this

00:21:24.370 --> 00:21:28.740
set of rules up here.
And, by making that comparison,

00:21:28.740 --> 00:21:33.120
we can deduce which of these three
crystal structures the crystal

00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:37.490
belongs to. And I am keeping this
as a very narrow set.

00:21:37.490 --> 00:21:41.870
I am saying this is 3.
91 so we confine ourselves to the

00:21:41.870 --> 00:21:46.240
universe of cubic crystals.
If you want to get more general

00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:50.620
then it could be any one of the
crystals that comes out of the 14

00:21:50.620 --> 00:22:08.840
Bravais lattices, plus
a range of bases.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:41.000
There is a huge database out there
that has values of intensity versus

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:47.000
angle for thousands and thousands of
metals and compounds.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:53.000
A huge amount of mineralogy in this
database. And so,

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:59.000
when you bring a specimen of unknown
provenance, you are able to use this

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:05.000
technique and infer what
the constituents are.

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:31.750
First of all, let's take a look at
what the specimen looks like.

00:22:31.750 --> 00:22:49.066
I cannot take a few atoms. What we
use is a powdered specimen.

00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:45.250
We grind the material into a fine
powder and we put it in a silicate

00:22:45.250 --> 00:23:02.966
glass holder. And a silicate glass
holder looks something like this.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:55.730
It is a very narrow tube.
This is definitely not to scale.

00:22:55.730 --> 00:22:59.460
This dimension here is about a
tenth of a millimeter.

00:22:59.460 --> 00:23:03.190
It is a very narrow tube,
a tenth of a millimeter made of

00:23:03.190 --> 00:23:06.930
silicate glass.
It is an oxide glass,

00:23:06.930 --> 00:23:10.660
a cousin of window glass.
Why do we choose it? Not because

00:23:10.660 --> 00:23:14.390
it is transparent visible light.
We don't care. We are shooting

00:23:14.390 --> 00:23:18.130
x-rays through this thing,
for heaven's sakes. Why do we

00:23:18.130 --> 00:23:22.830
choose this?
Because it is amorphous and it

00:23:22.830 --> 00:23:28.490
doesn't have a crystal structure of
its own. If we are trying to

00:23:28.490 --> 00:23:34.160
irradiate the contents of this and
the tube itself has a crystal

00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:39.830
structure, how are we going to sort
out what is the contents from the

00:23:39.830 --> 00:23:45.490
container. This is amorphous,
no long range order. And inside we

00:23:45.490 --> 00:23:51.160
put little grains of powder.
The powder dimension is on the

00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:55.920
order of about 50 micrometers.
Oh, the wall thickness,

00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:59.780
I didn't mention that. That is one
one-hundredth of a millimeter.

00:23:59.780 --> 00:24:03.640
Saying it is paper thin is an
exaggeration. It is one-hundredth

00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:07.490
of a millimeter.
And this distance is about two

00:24:07.490 --> 00:24:11.350
centimeters. You grind in a mortar
and pestle, drop the powder in here,

00:24:11.350 --> 00:24:15.210
and this goes into the
diffractometer and is irradiated.

00:24:15.210 --> 00:24:19.070
And we are going to turn this in
order to present as many different

00:24:19.070 --> 00:24:22.810
angles as possible.
We have many grains in here.

00:24:22.810 --> 00:24:26.430
Each grain, the theory is if we
grind these fine enough,

00:24:26.430 --> 00:24:30.060
each one of these can act as a
single crystal.

00:24:30.060 --> 00:24:33.680
Now light is coming in and
reflecting off this,

00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:37.300
but its cousin is sitting at a
slightly different angle.

00:24:37.300 --> 00:24:40.930
And so I am going to try to,
through the mix of powder and the

00:24:40.930 --> 00:24:44.560
rotation of the specimen,
try to get all of the different

00:24:44.560 --> 00:24:48.180
incident angles so that I will get
as many reflected angles as possible.

00:24:48.180 --> 00:24:51.820
I worked with this.
It was my PhD thesis.

00:24:51.820 --> 00:24:55.460
The material was sensitive to
moisture in the air so I had to work

00:24:55.460 --> 00:24:59.110
in a glove box.
I had these big thick rubber gloves

00:24:59.110 --> 00:25:02.760
on holding something like this.
Only in real life it is about this

00:25:02.760 --> 00:25:06.400
big. And you are inside the glove
box and it's Toronto in August and

00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:10.050
perspiration is pouring.
You are supposed to be crying now.

00:25:10.050 --> 00:25:13.700
The perspiration is pouring down my
face. I have to get the powder to

00:25:13.700 --> 00:25:17.350
fall in here. And I have got to
flick this a little bit.

00:25:17.350 --> 00:25:36.500
I flick it one more time and it
breaks off.

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:25.830
You laugh now.
It's not funny.

00:25:25.830 --> 00:25:30.660
That's the way. That's how science
goes. Anyway.

00:25:30.660 --> 00:25:35.490
What happens now?
We take this. Now I am going to

00:25:35.490 --> 00:25:40.330
give you the top view of the
diffractometer.

00:25:40.330 --> 00:25:45.160
It is essentially the combination
of an x-ray generator,

00:25:45.160 --> 00:26:04.720
a specimen holder and a detector.
The top view has x-ray coming in.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:35.500
This is monochromatic x-ray,
some lambda fixed, coming in.

00:25:35.500 --> 00:25:41.000
Top view has this sitting in a
carousel, and this carousel spins.

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:46.500
And then I have a detector. And
the detector itself moves through a

00:25:46.500 --> 00:25:52.000
variety of angles.
And so here we have an incidence

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:57.500
angle and here we have a reflectance
angle. Ultimately,

00:25:57.500 --> 00:26:03.000
we get a plot of intensity versus
reflected angle from this specimen.

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:07.000
That is how this thing works.
And here is what the output could

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:11.000
look like. You will have nothing
and then you will have peaks at

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:15.000
discrete lines.
Why? At certain angles the Bragg

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:19.000
condition is satisfied.
At other angles the Bragg condition

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:23.000
is not satisfied.
These are the Bragg peaks

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:27.000
associated with magical angles.
And what are the magical angles?

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:31.000
They are the angles associated with
those planes.

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:55.130
This is how we are trying to make
sense of what is going on here.

00:26:55.130 --> 00:26:59.260
I wanted to give you the thrill of
discovery, so we are going to do a

00:26:59.260 --> 00:27:03.390
virtual lab here.
What I have for you is a data set.

00:27:03.390 --> 00:27:07.530
If you flip over your sheet, this
is all you get,

00:27:07.530 --> 00:27:11.660
the output. Now,
for reasons I don't want to go into,

00:27:11.660 --> 00:27:15.790
the angles are often reported as two
theta instead of theta.

00:27:15.790 --> 00:27:19.930
And it has to do with the geometry
of this specimen and

00:27:19.930 --> 00:27:23.750
blah, blah, blah.
But that is not important.

00:27:23.750 --> 00:27:27.250
We have a copper target in the
x-ray generator,

00:27:27.250 --> 00:27:30.750
which means we will have
monochromatic light lambda 1.

00:27:30.750 --> 00:27:34.250
418 angstroms. We know that. And,
remember, we said we had to fix our

00:27:34.250 --> 00:27:37.750
lambda. We have done that.
We have rotated the specimen

00:27:37.750 --> 00:27:41.250
variable theta.
And these are the peaks.

00:27:41.250 --> 00:27:44.750
I don't care about the intensities.
All I am doing right now is telling

00:27:44.750 --> 00:27:48.250
you these are the peaks that I got.
How do we take that and infer what

00:27:48.250 --> 00:27:51.760
the crystal is?
Well, you can go to the library and

00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:55.290
get all these self-help books.
I have not had the time to write a

00:27:55.290 --> 00:27:58.820
full self-help book,
but I got this one self-help sheet

00:27:58.820 --> 00:28:02.350
here. This is my program.
You won't find this in any books.

00:28:02.350 --> 00:28:05.880
This I am giving to you special. I
want to walk through this and show

00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:09.410
you how to take that dataset and
index the crystal.

00:28:09.410 --> 00:28:12.940
The question we are trying to
answer is what is the crystal

00:28:12.940 --> 00:28:16.460
structure? And you only have three
answers. It's either going to be

00:28:16.460 --> 00:28:36.653
simple cubic, body-centered cubic or
face-centered cubic.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:25.270
And that is the dataset.
That is all you have, plus your

00:28:25.270 --> 00:28:30.540
mind. It says start with the two
theta values and generate a set of

00:28:30.540 --> 00:28:35.810
sine squared theta values.
Oh, I should perhaps tell you how I

00:28:35.810 --> 00:28:41.080
came up with this,
what is the underlying principle.

00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:46.360
Here is the underlying principle.
To solve the puzzle, all I did was

00:28:46.360 --> 00:28:51.810
I took these two equations.
I took the Bragg's Law,

00:28:51.810 --> 00:28:57.450
which is lambda equals 2 d sine
theta, and I took the formula for

00:28:57.450 --> 00:29:03.090
the d spacing between planes,
which you saw two days ago, which is

00:29:03.090 --> 00:29:08.720
the ratio of the lattice constant
divided by the sum of the squares of

00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:14.360
the Miller Indices of the plane.
If I take those two equations and

00:29:14.360 --> 00:29:32.386
put them together,
I can get the following relationship.

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:05.000
Lambda squared over 4 a squared
equals sine squared theta over h

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:10.000
squared plus k squared plus l
squared. Now,

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:15.000
look at the left side of this
equation. Lambda is the wavelength

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:20.000
of the incident radiation,
and that is fixed. We fixed that in

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:25.000
the experiment,
so this is a constant.

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:30.000
It is fixed. A is the lattice
constant of the crystal.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:54.140
That is the crystal property,
so that is fixed. That means the

00:29:54.140 --> 00:29:58.280
ratio of lambda squared over 4 a
squared is a constant.

00:29:58.280 --> 00:30:02.420
Well, when I went to school,
what they taught me in math was that

00:30:02.420 --> 00:30:06.560
if the left-hand side of the
equation is constant,

00:30:06.560 --> 00:30:10.710
the right-hand side of the equation
is constant. That means even though

00:30:10.710 --> 00:30:14.850
theta is varying with hkl,
this ratio varies in such a way as

00:30:14.850 --> 00:30:33.033
to remain constant.
That is the key.

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:23.420
Whatever hkl is,
at that theta, the sine squared of

00:30:23.420 --> 00:30:27.850
that angle over the h squared plus k
squared plus l squared remains

00:30:27.850 --> 00:30:32.280
constant as you go through all of
the lines. This is the underlying

00:30:32.280 --> 00:30:36.710
principle. Let's go into this.
The first thing I want to do is

00:30:36.710 --> 00:30:41.140
build sine squared theta.
There they are. Those are the

00:30:41.140 --> 00:30:45.560
theta values. And now I have taken
them, divided them by two and then

00:30:45.560 --> 00:31:05.053
taken the sine and then squared it.
Now I have a new column.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:54.300
And then it says normalize by
dividing sine squared theta by the

00:30:54.300 --> 00:30:58.610
first member of the column.
All I did was took everything and

00:30:58.610 --> 00:31:02.920
divided it by 0.
43. This 0.143 divided by 0.

00:31:02.920 --> 00:31:07.230
43 is one. This is, as you can see,
0.190 divided by 0.140 is about 1.34

00:31:07.230 --> 00:31:11.530
and so on. Why?
Because, look, I am going to this.

00:31:11.530 --> 00:31:15.840
What is the next thing? Clear the
fractions from the normalized column.

00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:34.080
I don't like this.
I don't like 1.

00:30:59.800 --> 00:31:23.390
0, 1.34 and so on.
1.34 to me, allowing for some

00:31:23.390 --> 00:31:26.990
experimental error,
is roughly one and a third.

00:31:26.990 --> 00:31:30.590
It is roughly four-thirds. And
that is 2.67. That is roughly

00:31:30.590 --> 00:31:34.190
eight-thirds. Why not multiply the
whole darn column by 3 and throw

00:31:34.190 --> 00:31:37.790
away the little residuals.
And, sure enough, you get a set of

00:31:37.790 --> 00:31:41.390
whole numbers,
3, 4, 8, 11, 12 and so on.

00:31:41.390 --> 00:32:00.313
This is good. We are getting
somewhere.

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:49.660
Now it says speculate,
this is where you get to participate,

00:31:49.660 --> 00:31:54.330
on the hkl values that if expressed
as h squared plus k squared plus l

00:31:54.330 --> 00:31:58.990
squared would generate the sequence
of the clear fractions column.

00:31:58.990 --> 00:32:03.660
And remember what you have to go on.
You have that set of simple cubic,

00:32:03.660 --> 00:32:08.330
face-centered cubic, body-centered
cubic. What set of hkl's would give

00:32:08.330 --> 00:32:12.990
you this? Well,
what sum of integer squares would

00:32:12.990 --> 00:32:17.660
give you three?
I wonder. Maybe 1,

00:32:17.660 --> 00:32:22.060
,1. How about 4?
And so you can see what is going on

00:32:22.060 --> 00:32:26.190
here. This I have gotten from the
theta, and this is my speculation,

00:32:26.190 --> 00:32:30.330
just trying. And now here is the
punch line. Compute for each theta

00:32:30.330 --> 00:32:34.460
the value of this.
The sine squared theta over h

00:32:34.460 --> 00:32:38.590
squared plus k squared plus l
squared. And,

00:32:38.590 --> 00:32:42.730
if you get a constant,
bingo, you must have hit the jackpot.

00:32:42.730 --> 00:32:46.860
Sine squared theta is this.
H squared plus k squared plus l

00:32:46.860 --> 00:33:05.586
squared is square root
of 3. That is 0.0477.

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:55.920
You do it for the next one,
the next one and next one allowing

00:32:55.920 --> 00:33:00.840
for experimental error.
I have a constant. What does that

00:33:00.840 --> 00:33:05.760
say? It says that my speculation of
what the hkl's are is good.

00:33:05.760 --> 00:33:10.690
It is self-consistent. And what do
I know? Those are either all even

00:33:10.690 --> 00:33:15.610
or all odd. That is the sequence
for face-centered cubic.

00:33:15.610 --> 00:33:20.530
So, on this basis, I can say that I
have something that is

00:33:20.530 --> 00:33:38.360
face-centered cubic.
I am happy about that.

00:33:05.500 --> 00:33:10.500
But, furthermore, what else can I
get? Well, I know the lambda value

00:33:10.500 --> 00:33:15.500
and I know this thing.
This is that constant there.

00:33:15.500 --> 00:33:20.500
What I can do is take this constant
and plug it into this equation.

00:33:20.500 --> 00:33:25.500
And, furthermore, I can determine
that the a, whatever this crystal is,

00:33:25.500 --> 00:33:30.500
is going to be lambda of copper k
alpha divided by 2 times the square

00:33:30.500 --> 00:33:55.250
root of that constant.
And, if I plug in the numbers,

00:33:55.250 --> 00:33:59.750
I get 3.53 angstroms. It is FCC.
It is 3.53 angstroms. If I look at

00:33:59.750 --> 00:34:04.250
it and it looks metallic,
I am going to say it is nickel,

00:34:04.250 --> 00:34:08.750
because I happen to know that nickel
has a lattice constant of 3.

00:34:08.750 --> 00:34:13.250
3 angstroms. I know I have to do
some other things,

00:34:13.250 --> 00:34:17.750
but certainly that makes me think
about whether I have nickel present.

00:34:17.750 --> 00:34:22.610
Here is the gambit.
That is how you are going to solve

00:34:22.610 --> 00:34:27.840
these problems.
You are going to go through this

00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:33.070
set of operations.
Just to recap, if you are going to

00:34:33.070 --> 00:34:38.300
look at this, simple cubic,
the hkl sequence is 1, 2, 3,

00:34:38.300 --> 00:34:43.530
4, 5, 6, 8, 9, because there is no
sum of integers that will give you

00:34:43.530 --> 00:34:48.760
seven if you sum squares of integers.
It will give you all the lines,

00:34:48.760 --> 00:35:08.186
but this is h squared plus k squared
plus l squared in ascending value.

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:59.090
Body-centered cubic has to be 2,
4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16. But, when

00:34:59.090 --> 00:35:04.180
you first do this,
you don't know because you divide by

00:35:04.180 --> 00:35:09.270
the first sine squared.
And so you don't know it is 2,

00:35:09.270 --> 00:35:14.360
4, 6, 8. You could end up with 1,
2, 3, 4. Now, don't we have a

00:35:14.360 --> 00:35:19.450
problem? The simple cubic is going
1, 2, 3, 4 and body-centered cubic

00:35:19.450 --> 00:35:24.330
is going 1, 2, 3, 4.
But watch this,

00:35:24.330 --> 00:35:28.990
perseverance. Half of 10 is 5.
Half of 12 is 6. Half of 14 is 7.

00:35:28.990 --> 00:35:33.660
Bingo. If you guessed that
something when you divide through

00:35:33.660 --> 00:35:38.330
you get a sequence that gives you 1,
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, you know that it

00:35:38.330 --> 00:35:42.990
cannot be simple cubic because there
is no sum of integer squares that

00:35:42.990 --> 00:35:47.660
gives you 7. This 7,
in fact, must be 14 divided by 2.

00:35:47.660 --> 00:35:52.300
This is body-centered cubic.
Face-centered cubic is the easiest

00:35:52.300 --> 00:35:56.920
one to pick off because it gives you
3, 4, 8, 11, 12.

00:35:56.920 --> 00:36:01.530
I mean, I just need to see 3,
4 and I am done. I always check for

00:36:01.530 --> 00:36:06.150
FCC first. Anyway,
that is how diffractometry works.

00:36:06.150 --> 00:36:10.760
And it allows you to index crystals
and determine their crystal

00:36:10.760 --> 00:36:15.380
structure. And,
more broadly speaking,

00:36:15.380 --> 00:36:35.293
there is a database of all sorts of
minerals and compounds and so on.

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:06.000
Let's look at the second technique
which is called Laue diffraction

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:12.000
named after Max von Laue who got the
Nobel. He was the first person to

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:18.000
demonstrate x-ray identification of
crystal structure.

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:24.000
He got the Nobel in 1912 for this.
And in Laue we fix the angle, the

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:30.000
specimen is stationary and variable
wavelength radiation.

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:34.000
How do we get variable wavelength
radiation? Look at that spectrum up

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:38.000
there. You see the bremsstrahlung?
The bremsstrahlung gives you a

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:42.000
range of wavelengths.
How do we get monochromatic

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:46.000
radiation? How do we get
monochromatic x-rays?

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:50.000
And don't tell me we buy an x-ray
laser. How do we get monochromatic

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:54.000
x-rays? Well,
it is really cool.

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:58.000
What you do is take this
bremsstrahlung with

00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:22.260
everything on it.
And you present it to a single

00:37:22.260 --> 00:37:26.790
crystal. And then you park over
here, this is the entrance slit to

00:37:26.790 --> 00:37:31.330
your diffractometer.
What will go through that entrance

00:37:31.330 --> 00:37:35.860
slit? There is only one wavelength
that will go through that entrance

00:37:35.860 --> 00:37:40.390
slit, and that is the wavelength
that satisfies the Bragg condition

00:37:40.390 --> 00:37:44.930
for this lattice spacing at this
angle. What I can do is make a

00:37:44.930 --> 00:37:49.460
single crystal monochromator that
basically takes this characteristic

00:37:49.460 --> 00:38:07.386
spectrum on top of the
bremsstrahlung.

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:59.190
Sends that in.
I present a single crystal.

00:37:59.190 --> 00:38:04.390
And there is only one wavelength of
light that will come out of here

00:38:04.390 --> 00:38:09.590
that satisfies the Bragg condition
for this d spacing and this angle.

00:38:09.590 --> 00:38:14.790
The single crystal acts as a
monochromator.

00:38:14.790 --> 00:38:33.313
Very cool. This is called a single
crystal monochromator.

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:06.000
Just use Bragg's Law.
That is all. Well, in this case,

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:12.000
we take the whole mess, everything.
And here is what the specimen looks

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:18.000
like. The specimen goes into a
darkened box called a "camera

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:24.000
obscura." And what happens is I can
put the specimen on the front here.

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:30.000
This is some crystal, relatively
thin.

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:55.450
And I put film on the back.
I have film that is sensitive to

00:38:55.450 --> 00:39:00.900
x-ray. Now I send the beam in.
This is white x-ray meaning it is

00:39:00.900 --> 00:39:06.360
variable wavelength.
It is the whole spectrum.

00:39:06.360 --> 00:39:11.810
And what happens is the white x-ray
interacts with the specimen and

00:39:11.810 --> 00:39:17.270
shoots off at different angles
because I have different

00:39:17.270 --> 00:39:35.640
initial wavelengths.
Each wavelength will be diffracted

00:39:02.500 --> 00:39:07.500
at its own special angle.
What happens is we end up with a

00:39:07.500 --> 00:39:15.000
spot pattern on the film.

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:40.110
Spot pattern is the output.
And the symmetry of the spot

00:39:40.110 --> 00:39:45.220
pattern. I am not going to take you
into k space and so on,

00:39:45.220 --> 00:39:50.330
but let me simply tell you that all
you need to appreciate at this point

00:39:50.330 --> 00:39:55.440
is that the symmetry in the spot
pattern is imitative of the symmetry

00:39:55.440 --> 00:40:00.870
in the crystal.
Let me say something about atomic

00:40:00.870 --> 00:40:06.620
symmetry. And all we are talking
about here is rotational symmetry

00:40:06.620 --> 00:40:12.370
because we are looking at something
on edge. For example,

00:40:12.370 --> 00:40:18.120
if I gave you the 001 plane,
in a cubic crystal it looks like

00:40:18.120 --> 00:40:23.210
this.
Now what I want to do is look at

00:40:23.210 --> 00:40:27.640
rotation about a normal axis.
I am going to put a normal axis

00:40:27.640 --> 00:40:32.070
right here at the center,
and I am going to rotate this.

00:40:32.070 --> 00:40:36.490
I am going to ask you the question
through what angle do I have to

00:40:36.490 --> 00:40:40.920
rotate this in order to get this
back? If you close your eyes and I

00:40:40.920 --> 00:40:45.350
start rotating,
suppose I rotate it 45 degrees,

00:40:45.350 --> 00:40:49.780
you open your eyes, you are going to
see that and know something

00:40:49.780 --> 00:40:54.330
has moved.
How many degrees do I have to rotate

00:40:54.330 --> 00:40:58.990
before I get this back?
90. If I rotate 90 degrees,

00:40:58.990 --> 00:41:03.660
I will end up with this. These are
indistinguishable.

00:41:03.660 --> 00:41:08.330
90 degrees is what I need to rotate.
And the crystallographers,

00:41:08.330 --> 00:41:12.990
instead of talking about the angle
of rotation to restore what you are

00:41:12.990 --> 00:41:17.660
looking at, they talk about fold.
And fold is simply 360 degrees

00:41:17.660 --> 00:41:35.786
divided by this angle.
We say that this has four-fold

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:09.000
rotational symmetry.
Suppose I look at (011).

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:15.000
(011) is the diagonal. This is a
and this is square root of 2a.

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:21.000
And now, if I put an axis in the
center, through what angle do I have

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:27.000
to rotate before I get this back?
That is 180. This has two-fold

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:52.330
symmetry.
Finally, let's do (111).

00:41:52.330 --> 00:41:56.990
The (111) plane looks like this.
And so, obviously, this you would

00:41:56.990 --> 00:42:01.660
have to go through 120.
And this would exhibit three-fold

00:42:01.660 --> 00:42:06.330
symmetry. For example,
remember I showed you that crystal

00:42:06.330 --> 00:42:10.990
of the silicon,
single crystal silicon?

00:42:10.990 --> 00:42:15.660
The single crystal silicon,
let's say we have cut it and we want

00:42:15.660 --> 00:42:35.920
to find out what plane we cut it on.
Suppose we want to insure that we

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:04.000
have cut it so that the 111 plane is
parallel to the surface.

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:08.000
One way of determining this would
be to put the single crystal of

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:12.000
silicon into a Laue unit and
irradiate it. And,

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:16.000
if indeed we have the 111 plane,
we will see a spot pattern that

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:20.000
exhibits three-fold symmetry.
This allows us to do indexing.

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:24.000
The other thing we can do is put
the specimen on the back and have

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:28.000
the film on the front.
And we end up with what is known as

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:52.300
Laue backscatter.
Let's take a look at a few more

00:42:52.300 --> 00:42:56.920
symmetries. This is going back to
some Escher prints.

00:42:56.920 --> 00:43:01.530
I don't think I showed you this one
the other day.

00:43:01.530 --> 00:43:06.150
What is that crystal structure?
It is either body-centered cubic or

00:43:06.150 --> 00:43:10.760
face-centered cubic.
The two are the same in

00:43:10.760 --> 00:43:15.380
two-dimensions.
This would exhibit four-fold

00:43:15.380 --> 00:43:34.760
symmetry. This pattern exhibits
four-fold symmetry. This one.

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:24.760
Symmetry now. Three-fold symmetry.
120. I even tried it. I rotated

00:43:24.760 --> 00:43:29.530
this. I actually programmed
Photoshop. I said rotate 120 degrees.

00:43:29.530 --> 00:43:34.300
Bingo. Now you see.
Now, these are some Laue patterns

00:43:34.300 --> 00:43:39.070
of various crystals.
This is what you see in the Laue

00:43:39.070 --> 00:43:43.840
unit. Three different crystals here.
Let's look. What do we see?

00:43:43.840 --> 00:43:48.610
How about this one? You won't be
able to tell the crystal structure.

00:43:48.610 --> 00:43:53.410
All you can see is the pattern.
All you can ask from this is what is

00:43:53.410 --> 00:43:58.240
the pattern? Which of these
symmetries do we have?

00:43:58.240 --> 00:44:03.080
Is this four-fold, three-fold or
two-fold? This looks like four-fold,

00:44:03.080 --> 00:44:07.910
90 degrees, pretty good.
This one here, well, you're right.

00:44:07.910 --> 00:44:12.740
You can say six. It looks like 60
but, in fact, you need to go the

00:44:12.740 --> 00:44:17.580
full and there are other reasons you
have to go into that.

00:44:17.580 --> 00:44:21.870
This is two-fold.
Remember this?

00:44:21.870 --> 00:44:25.620
This one is, you can see,
a 60 degree angle, but you can see

00:44:25.620 --> 00:44:29.370
this has three-fold symmetry.
This gets back to somebody who said

00:44:29.370 --> 00:44:33.120
60 degrees. You can see this
pattern requires because of the

00:44:33.120 --> 00:44:36.870
basis here, in fact,
it requires 120 degrees.

00:44:36.870 --> 00:44:40.620
What about this one? Exactly.
It is one-fold. This has

00:44:40.620 --> 00:44:44.370
translational symmetry but no
rotational symmetry.

00:44:44.370 --> 00:44:48.120
Obviously, if you go 90 degrees,
the dogs are going to be pointing up

00:44:48.120 --> 00:44:52.300
and down.
If you go 180 degrees,

00:44:52.300 --> 00:44:56.920
it is not going to work either.
This has rotational one-fold. I am

00:44:56.920 --> 00:45:01.530
going to jump over this,
I think. I see we are getting close

00:45:01.530 --> 00:45:06.150
to the end. Here is another
symmetry. This is the inverse of

00:45:06.150 --> 00:45:10.760
the dogs. The dogs have no
rotational symmetry but

00:45:10.760 --> 00:45:15.380
translational symmetry.
This pattern here has rotational

00:45:15.380 --> 00:45:33.293
symmetry but no translational
symmetry.

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:26.660
It is called Penrose Tile.
And, in particular, there is the

00:45:26.660 --> 00:45:33.330
rotational symmetry.
And how many turns do we go here?

00:45:33.330 --> 00:45:39.990
It has five-fold symmetry. Five.
That is very weird.

00:45:39.990 --> 00:45:46.660
Five-fold symmetry.
Now, this does not conform to any

00:45:46.660 --> 00:45:52.230
rules of crystallography.
Such a pattern is called aperiodic.

00:45:52.230 --> 00:45:56.690
We saw that you couldn't make
bathroom tile of this shape.

00:45:56.690 --> 00:46:01.150
You would have to have other shapes
that would fit into the interstices

00:46:01.150 --> 00:46:05.610
and so on. There is another one.
See, it fills to space, but you

00:46:05.610 --> 00:46:10.070
have to add some extra.
But it has five-fold symmetry.

00:46:10.070 --> 00:46:14.530
If you take this whole pattern and
rotate it 72 degrees,

00:46:14.530 --> 00:46:33.260
you will get it back. It has
rotational symmetry.

00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:22.870
Now I am going to show you something
that was really,

00:46:22.870 --> 00:46:26.740
really unexpected.
So far we are over here in the top

00:46:26.740 --> 00:46:30.620
left. We are studying ordered
solids which they have a unit cell,

00:46:30.620 --> 00:46:34.490
they are periodic, and we call them
a crystal. And pretty soon we are

00:46:34.490 --> 00:46:38.370
going to start studying disordered
solids which form glasses.

00:46:38.370 --> 00:46:42.240
In 1982, there was a fellow by the
name of Dan Schechtman who was on

00:46:42.240 --> 00:46:46.120
sabbatical from the Technion in
Israel. He was working down at the

00:46:46.120 --> 00:47:06.306
National Bureau of Standards.
It was called NBS in those days.

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:53.850
It is now known as the National
Institute of Standards and

00:46:53.850 --> 00:46:57.710
Technology. Sometimes you will see
this acronym NIST.

00:46:57.710 --> 00:47:01.560
And they were down in Gaithersburg,
Maryland. And Schechtman and John

00:47:01.560 --> 00:47:05.420
Kahn and coworkers were looking at a
set of alloys from the aluminum

00:47:05.420 --> 00:47:09.280
manganese system,
and they were very highly ordered.

00:47:09.280 --> 00:47:13.140
Over the range of composition, pure
aluminum is FCC.

00:47:13.140 --> 00:47:32.346
Pure manganese has multiple crystal
structures.

00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:20.680
The question is what happens when
you take something that is not

00:47:20.680 --> 00:47:24.360
face-centered cubic and alloy it
with something that is face-centered

00:47:24.360 --> 00:47:28.050
cubic? Well, initially aluminum
retains its face-centered cubic

00:47:28.050 --> 00:47:31.730
crystal structure.
But, after a while,

00:47:31.730 --> 00:47:35.420
you get to such a high manganese
level that the crystal structure

00:47:35.420 --> 00:47:39.100
changes. And over certain ranges of
composition these alloys are

00:47:39.100 --> 00:47:42.780
amorphous. They are glass formers.
But then came something totally

00:47:42.780 --> 00:47:46.470
unexpected. When Schechtman
prepared the alloy that contained

00:47:46.470 --> 00:47:50.150
25% manganese he got something
extremely weird in the x-ray

00:47:50.150 --> 00:48:09.766
diffraction pattern.
He got five-fold symmetry in his

00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:38.000
x-ray diffraction pattern.
Five-fold symmetry. This lax

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:42.000
translational symmetry,
it is aperiodic, these were termed

00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:46.000
quasicrystals.
And this caused a storm in the

00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:50.000
material science community.
In the mid ‘80s, all kinds of NSF

00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:54.000
programs, Department of Defense
programs were funding research into

00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:58.000
quasicrystals to try to figure out
they might have some

00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:22.660
unique properties.
Maybe they have conductivities.

00:48:22.660 --> 00:48:27.990
Maybe they have ductilities. Maybe
they have corrosion resistance that

00:48:27.990 --> 00:48:33.330
is unknown in classical
face-centered,

00:48:33.330 --> 00:48:38.660
body-centered, simple cubic alloys.
Here is one of Schechtman's Laue

00:48:38.660 --> 00:48:43.990
patterns. Look at that.
That is so weird. There were jokes

00:48:43.990 --> 00:48:49.330
about this. If you know the
geography, Gaithersburg is not far

00:48:49.330 --> 00:48:54.540
from Washington.
Some people joked that this had

00:48:54.540 --> 00:48:59.630
five-fold symmetry because the
research was funded by the Pentagon.

00:48:59.630 --> 00:49:04.720
And this is really something.
These are the pages from

00:49:04.720 --> 00:49:09.810
Schechtman's lab notebook.
April 8, 1982, aluminum 25%

00:49:09.810 --> 00:49:14.900
manganese. And he is analyzing his
diffraction patterns and is going

00:49:14.900 --> 00:49:33.066
nuts. He writes ten-fold
exclamation point triple.

00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:23.860
And it was real.
It was very, very exciting.

00:49:23.860 --> 00:49:27.730
That is what quasicrystals are
about. What you can see is how

00:49:27.730 --> 00:49:31.590
using Laue you can infer that.
And then you have to go in and

00:49:31.590 --> 00:49:35.460
determine what the lattice constant
is and so on. The last thing,

00:49:35.460 --> 00:49:39.330
before you go. I ran out of time
last day. What is the connected

00:49:39.330 --> 00:49:43.190
between 7-Up and lithium?
Before Mosley people referred to

00:49:43.190 --> 00:49:47.060
things according to their atomic
mass. The atomic mass of lithium is

00:49:47.060 --> 00:49:51.250
7. That is why it is 7.
I have this on good authority from

00:49:51.250 --> 00:49:55.383
people in the lithium industry.
All right. Have a good weekend.
