marshmallow so so what are some of the

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770
marshmallow so so what are some of the
 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.620

come from a print background and mobile

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979
come from a print background and mobile
 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.880
come from a print background and mobile
doing typography on mobile is extremely

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890
doing typography on mobile is extremely
 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.039
doing typography on mobile is extremely
different than doing typography on print

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049
different than doing typography on print
 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.899
different than doing typography on print
there are some things in common but

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909
there are some things in common but
 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.370
there are some things in common but
there are some things that are that are

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380
there are some things that are that are
 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.230
there are some things that are that are
really different you have to be very

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240
really different you have to be very
 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.520
really different you have to be very
focused on the performance you know of

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530
focused on the performance you know of
 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.249
focused on the performance you know of
of the text stack because you've got

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259
of the text stack because you've got
 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.170
of the text stack because you've got
only so much battery and only so much

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180
only so much battery and only so much
 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.389
only so much battery and only so much
RAM but you really do have very powerful

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399
RAM but you really do have very powerful
 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.219
RAM but you really do have very powerful
compute resources you've got you know

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229
compute resources you've got you know
 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.410
compute resources you've got you know
multi-core multi gigahertz processes in

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420
multi-core multi gigahertz processes in
 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.380
multi-core multi gigahertz processes in
there so if you want to do sophisticated

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390
there so if you want to do sophisticated
 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.760
there so if you want to do sophisticated
advanced typography you do have the

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770
advanced typography you do have the
 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.209
advanced typography you do have the
compute power to do that 60 frames a

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219
compute power to do that 60 frames a
 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.789
compute power to do that 60 frames a
second is absolutely a requirement and

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799
second is absolutely a requirement and
 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.530
second is absolutely a requirement and
this is again both a challenge and an

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540
this is again both a challenge and an
 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.050
this is again both a challenge and an
opportunity that that you can do these

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060
opportunity that that you can do these
 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.730
opportunity that that you can do these
really rich animations and transitions

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740
really rich animations and transitions
 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.510
really rich animations and transitions
and do this kind of interactive motion

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520
and do this kind of interactive motion
 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.979
and do this kind of interactive motion
typography that that really is you know

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989
typography that that really is you know
 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.720
typography that that really is you know
completely impossible in a print

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730
completely impossible in a print
 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:12.950
completely impossible in a print
background but you

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:12.960
background but you
 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.770
background but you
have to make everything fit in that

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780
have to make everything fit in that
 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.020
have to make everything fit in that
16-millisecond budget you've got a very

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030
16-millisecond budget you've got a very
 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.850
16-millisecond budget you've got a very
small screen and this has some

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860
small screen and this has some
 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.250
small screen and this has some
interesting challenges in how you create

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260
interesting challenges in how you create
 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.890
interesting challenges in how you create
your layouts how you do the paragraph

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900
your layouts how you do the paragraph
 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.040
your layouts how you do the paragraph
layout but but a flip side it again is

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050
layout but but a flip side it again is
 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:29.480
layout but but a flip side it again is
that on modern devices you have this

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.490
that on modern devices you have this
 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:32.720
that on modern devices you have this
very high resolution then as I mentioned

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730
very high resolution then as I mentioned
 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.370
very high resolution then as I mentioned
you know we have this requirement to

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380
you know we have this requirement to
 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.220
you know we have this requirement to
support all of the languages of the

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230
support all of the languages of the
 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:38.660
support all of the languages of the
world all the scripts of the world but

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670
world all the scripts of the world but
 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.120
world all the scripts of the world but
we have a lot of really good resources

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.130
we have a lot of really good resources
 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:43.190
we have a lot of really good resources
both in fonts and typography control of

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200
both in fonts and typography control of
 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.520
both in fonts and typography control of
how you do that and then you know I'm

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530
how you do that and then you know I'm
 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.050
how you do that and then you know I'm
gonna talk about some of the line

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060
gonna talk about some of the line
 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:49.190
gonna talk about some of the line
breaking improvements some of the

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200
breaking improvements some of the
 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.390
breaking improvements some of the
paragraph layout improvements in

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400
paragraph layout improvements in
 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:51.620
paragraph layout improvements in
marshmallow and those were really

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630
marshmallow and those were really
 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:54.020
marshmallow and those were really
motivated by a need to get this working

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030
motivated by a need to get this working
 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:57.400
motivated by a need to get this working
in very small screens like watch faces

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410
in very small screens like watch faces
 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:00.680
in very small screens like watch faces
so I'm gonna just kind of introduce this

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690
so I'm gonna just kind of introduce this
 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:02.570
so I'm gonna just kind of introduce this
concept of you know like the advance of

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580
concept of you know like the advance of
 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:04.100
concept of you know like the advance of
display technology this was the first

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110
display technology this was the first
 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:06.050
display technology this was the first
mobile device I ever had when I was 12

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060
mobile device I ever had when I was 12
 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.170
mobile device I ever had when I was 12
years old and I mean as you can see it's

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180
years old and I mean as you can see it's
 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.120
years old and I mean as you can see it's
got a lot of the elements of a modern

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130
got a lot of the elements of a modern
 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:14.860
got a lot of the elements of a modern
mobile device you know it even has a

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870
mobile device you know it even has a
 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:18.500
mobile device you know it even has a
really nice big keyboard but the display

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510
really nice big keyboard but the display
 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.020
really nice big keyboard but the display
technology at in this generation of

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030
technology at in this generation of
 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.690
technology at in this generation of
technology is kind of the bare minimum

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700
technology is kind of the bare minimum
 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.730
technology is kind of the bare minimum
that you need to get text displayed at

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:25.740
that you need to get text displayed at
 

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:28.760
that you need to get text displayed at
all and I think that that evolution you

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:28.770
all and I think that that evolution you
 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:30.140
all and I think that that evolution you
know kind of carried that there was a

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150
know kind of carried that there was a
 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.750
know kind of carried that there was a
very primitive approach to just get the

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760
very primitive approach to just get the
 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.840
very primitive approach to just get the
the letters drawn on the screen and not

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850
the letters drawn on the screen and not
 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:38.210
the letters drawn on the screen and not
really think about typography another

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220
really think about typography another
 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:39.890
really think about typography another
good thing about the screenshot is you

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900
good thing about the screenshot is you
 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:41.690
good thing about the screenshot is you
get some sense of like the difference in

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700
get some sense of like the difference in
 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:44.390
get some sense of like the difference in
computing power available today as you

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400
computing power available today as you
 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:49.460
computing power available today as you
know back then so you know before I work

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470
know back then so you know before I work
 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:52.430
know back then so you know before I work
on Android I was working on Google web

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440
on Android I was working on Google web
 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:55.190
on Android I was working on Google web

corner is kind of your classic laptop or

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:58.140
corner is kind of your classic laptop or
 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:59.840
corner is kind of your classic laptop or
desktop screen and this really ruled

00:03:59.840 --> 00:03:59.850
desktop screen and this really ruled
 

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:02.420
desktop screen and this really ruled
what we did that you have a very small

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430
what we did that you have a very small
 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:05.090
what we did that you have a very small
number of pixels to represent the text

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:05.100
number of pixels to represent the text
 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:07.280
number of pixels to represent the text
and you have a lot of constraints and

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290
and you have a lot of constraints and
 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:09.950
and you have a lot of constraints and
how this letterforms map into those

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:09.960
how this letterforms map into those
 

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:12.410
how this letterforms map into those
pixels and that also includes like the

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:12.420
pixels and that also includes like the
 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:14.810
pixels and that also includes like the
spacing you see kind of very poor like

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:14.820
spacing you see kind of very poor like
 

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:17.240
spacing you see kind of very poor like
the ANP or crunched up together and the

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250
the ANP or crunched up together and the
 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:18.560
the ANP or crunched up together and the
piano are separated because you only

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.570
piano are separated because you only
 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:20.690
piano are separated because you only
have so many pixels in so much precision

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:20.700
have so many pixels in so much precision
 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:23.690
have so many pixels in so much precision
but as you go into more modern display

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:23.700
but as you go into more modern display
 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:26.960
but as you go into more modern display
technology you have so many more picks

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:26.970
technology you have so many more picks
 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:29.570
technology you have so many more picks
and so on the upper right you have a 4k

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580
and so on the upper right you have a 4k
 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:32.870
and so on the upper right you have a 4k
monitor which is starting to replace

two year old device and it has 468 PPI
 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:43.010
two year old device and it has 468 PPI

pixels here and then comparing that to

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:45.570
pixels here and then comparing that to
 

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:47.780

for example an inkjet printer you

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:47.790
for example an inkjet printer you
 

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:49.820
for example an inkjet printer you
actually have on these mobile devices

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:49.830
actually have on these mobile devices
 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:52.760
actually have on these mobile devices
you have a much higher precision higher

one of the ways I think about screen
 

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:26.240
one of the ways I think about screen
resolution is you know when when Star

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:26.250
resolution is you know when when Star
 

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:28.850

Star Trek TV show they had like a book

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:30.300
Star Trek TV show they had like a book
 

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:32.540
Star Trek TV show they had like a book
that had all of the specifications for

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:32.550
that had all of the specifications for
 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:33.860
that had all of the specifications for
all the technology like how many

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:33.870
all the technology like how many
 

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:35.870
all the technology like how many
terajoules were in a phaser pulse and

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:35.880
terajoules were in a phaser pulse and
 

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:38.270
terajoules were in a phaser pulse and
one of the specifications is what is

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:38.280
one of the specifications is what is
 

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:39.890
one of the specifications is what is
discrete what is the resolution of these

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:39.900
discrete what is the resolution of these
 

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:42.260

knows about material design this this

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:54.720
knows about material design this this
 

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:56.120
knows about material design this this
will just touch on it that you know the

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:56.130
will just touch on it that you know the
 

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:58.400
will just touch on it that you know the
the UX team and started really about two

00:05:58.400 --> 00:05:58.410
the UX team and started really about two
 

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:00.080
the UX team and started really about two
years ago that they were looking at

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:00.090
years ago that they were looking at
 

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:02.000
years ago that they were looking at
these kind of more powerful devices

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:02.010
these kind of more powerful devices
 

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:03.890
these kind of more powerful devices
higher quality display technologies and

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:03.900
higher quality display technologies and
 

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:06.530
higher quality display technologies and
they were really thinking how how if we

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:06.540
they were really thinking how how if we
 

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:08.600
they were really thinking how how if we
were redesigning this from scratch if we

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:08.610
were redesigning this from scratch if we
 

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:11.240
were redesigning this from scratch if we
really could do anything what would we

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:11.250
really could do anything what would we
 

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:14.630
really could do anything what would we
do and the result of that exploration

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:14.640
do and the result of that exploration
 

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:17.720
do and the result of that exploration
really synthesized into a set of

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:17.730
really synthesized into a set of
 

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:20.810
really synthesized into a set of
guidelines into a coherent design

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:20.820
guidelines into a coherent design
 

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:22.940
guidelines into a coherent design
language that incorporates many

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:22.950
language that incorporates many
 

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:26.000
language that incorporates many
different elements it incorporates you

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:26.010
different elements it incorporates you
 

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:28.909
different elements it incorporates you
know colors it incorporates the material

00:06:28.909 --> 00:06:28.919
know colors it incorporates the material
 

00:06:28.919 --> 00:06:31.490
know colors it incorporates the material
metaphors with paper and and kind of a

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:31.500
metaphors with paper and and kind of a
 

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:34.520
metaphors with paper and and kind of a
three-dimensional effect and it also

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:34.530
three-dimensional effect and it also
 

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:38.740
three-dimensional effect and it also
incorporates typography and so you know

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:38.750
incorporates typography and so you know
 

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:40.670
incorporates typography and so you know
one of the section

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:40.680
one of the section
 

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:42.800
one of the section
in the material design spec I really

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:42.810
in the material design spec I really
 

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:46.400
in the material design spec I really
recommend it's it's very you know has a

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:46.410
recommend it's it's very you know has a
 

00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:49.129
recommend it's it's very you know has a
lot of good good information and a lot

00:06:49.129 --> 00:06:49.139
lot of good good information and a lot
 

00:06:49.139 --> 00:06:51.020
lot of good good information and a lot
of good guidance about how to do

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:51.030
of good guidance about how to do
 

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:53.689
of good guidance about how to do
typography within material design and of

00:06:53.689 --> 00:06:53.699
typography within material design and of
 

00:06:53.699 --> 00:06:56.270
typography within material design and of
course another part of that is a much

00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:56.280
course another part of that is a much
 

00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:59.540
course another part of that is a much
greater expanded palette of different

00:06:59.540 --> 00:06:59.550
greater expanded palette of different
 

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:02.390
greater expanded palette of different
weights and of different sizes and how

00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:02.400
weights and of different sizes and how
 

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:04.670
weights and of different sizes and how
you kind of use the weight in size

00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:04.680
you kind of use the weight in size
 

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:06.560
you kind of use the weight in size
instead of having just one size of tax

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:06.570
instead of having just one size of tax
 

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:09.439
instead of having just one size of tax
one way you use this to indicate the

00:07:09.439 --> 00:07:09.449
one way you use this to indicate the
 

00:07:09.449 --> 00:07:11.030
one way you use this to indicate the
structure of your app the structure of

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:11.040
structure of your app the structure of
 

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:15.590
structure of your app the structure of
the information in your app so the the

00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:15.600
the information in your app so the the
 

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:18.290
the information in your app so the the
cornerstone of typography in material

00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:18.300
cornerstone of typography in material
 

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:20.810
cornerstone of typography in material
design is the Roboto 2 typeface and so

00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:20.820
design is the Roboto 2 typeface and so
 

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:22.520
design is the Roboto 2 typeface and so
this was an update that happened in

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:22.530
this was an update that happened in
 

00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:25.460
this was an update that happened in
lollipop and you know it was pretty

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:25.470
lollipop and you know it was pretty
 

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:27.230
lollipop and you know it was pretty
subtle a lot of people probably didn't

00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:27.240
subtle a lot of people probably didn't
 

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:29.480
subtle a lot of people probably didn't
even notice it but there was actually a

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:29.490
even notice it but there was actually a
 

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:32.060
even notice it but there was actually a
lot going on in this update so one of

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:32.070
lot going on in this update so one of
 

00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:33.890
lot going on in this update so one of
the things is the expanded Unicode

00:07:33.890 --> 00:07:33.900
the things is the expanded Unicode
 

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:35.810
the things is the expanded Unicode
coverage it actually increased by a

00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:35.820
coverage it actually increased by a
 

00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:38.900
coverage it actually increased by a
factor of three and we have full support

00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:38.910
factor of three and we have full support
 

00:07:38.910 --> 00:07:42.050
factor of three and we have full support
for Unicode eight for Latin Greek and

00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:42.060
for Unicode eight for Latin Greek and
 

00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:45.589
for Unicode eight for Latin Greek and
Cyrillic scripts and that covers a lot

00:07:45.589 --> 00:07:45.599
Cyrillic scripts and that covers a lot
 

00:07:45.599 --> 00:07:47.930
Cyrillic scripts and that covers a lot
of the languages in the world that um

00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:47.940
of the languages in the world that um
 

00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:50.300
of the languages in the world that um
you know that are maybe less familiar to

00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:50.310
you know that are maybe less familiar to
 

00:07:50.310 --> 00:07:52.670
you know that are maybe less familiar to
us like the African languages use a lot

00:07:52.670 --> 00:07:52.680
us like the African languages use a lot
 

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:56.150
us like the African languages use a lot
of kind of unusual Latin characters we

00:07:56.150 --> 00:07:56.160
of kind of unusual Latin characters we
 

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:58.010
of kind of unusual Latin characters we
also expanded the weights and styles

00:07:58.010 --> 00:07:58.020
also expanded the weights and styles
 

00:07:58.020 --> 00:07:59.600
also expanded the weights and styles
that we ship on the device so we're

00:07:59.600 --> 00:07:59.610
that we ship on the device so we're
 

00:07:59.610 --> 00:08:02.210
that we ship on the device so we're
doing thin light regular medium bold and

00:08:02.210 --> 00:08:02.220
doing thin light regular medium bold and
 

00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:05.270
doing thin light regular medium bold and
black so there's a tremendous palette of

00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:05.280
black so there's a tremendous palette of
 

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:07.430
black so there's a tremendous palette of
the visual effects that you can get and

00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:07.440
the visual effects that you can get and
 

00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:09.830
the visual effects that you can get and
all of those include true italics and we

00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:09.840
all of those include true italics and we
 

00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:11.960
all of those include true italics and we
also have a family of condensed which is

00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:11.970
also have a family of condensed which is
 

00:08:11.970 --> 00:08:14.600
also have a family of condensed which is
better for better information density

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:14.610
better for better information density
 

00:08:14.610 --> 00:08:17.450
better for better information density
and also can give you some contrast you

00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:17.460
and also can give you some contrast you
 

00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:19.339
and also can give you some contrast you
know two different styles that you can

00:08:19.339 --> 00:08:19.349
know two different styles that you can
 

00:08:19.349 --> 00:08:23.150
know two different styles that you can
that you can work with in your app in

00:08:23.150 --> 00:08:23.160
that you can work with in your app in

addition the Roboto 2 font is completely

00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:26.370
addition the Roboto 2 font is completely
 

00:08:26.370 --> 00:08:27.890
addition the Roboto 2 font is completely
open-source and that includes not just

00:08:27.890 --> 00:08:27.900
open-source and that includes not just
 

00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:31.339
open-source and that includes not just
the final TrueType font files but the

00:08:31.339 --> 00:08:31.349
the final TrueType font files but the

entire bill chain so you can go in there

00:08:32.959 --> 00:08:32.969
entire bill chain so you can go in there
 

00:08:32.969 --> 00:08:34.930

and send us full requests and you know

00:08:38.570 --> 00:08:38.580
and send us full requests and you know
 

00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:40.459
and send us full requests and you know
we really treat almost everything we do

00:08:40.459 --> 00:08:40.469
we really treat almost everything we do
 

00:08:40.469 --> 00:08:46.400
we really treat almost everything we do
in a very open open-source manner so the

00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:46.410
in a very open open-source manner so the
 

00:08:46.410 --> 00:08:48.110
in a very open open-source manner so the
design updated as well

00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:48.120
design updated as well
 

00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:50.270
design updated as well
and this is just a little bit of a kind

00:08:50.270 --> 00:08:50.280
and this is just a little bit of a kind
 

00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:51.890
and this is just a little bit of a kind
of a before-and-after and you can see

00:08:51.890 --> 00:08:51.900
of a before-and-after and you can see
 

00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:53.630
of a before-and-after and you can see
there's it's it's a little subtle but

00:08:53.630 --> 00:08:53.640
there's it's it's a little subtle but
 

00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:54.380
there's it's it's a little subtle but
like there's kind

00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:54.390
like there's kind
 

00:08:54.390 --> 00:08:57.320
like there's kind
stiff sides to some of the characters

00:08:57.320 --> 00:08:57.330
stiff sides to some of the characters
 

00:08:57.330 --> 00:08:59.960
stiff sides to some of the characters
like a capital o and that has become a

00:08:59.960 --> 00:08:59.970
like a capital o and that has become a
 

00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:03.050
like a capital o and that has become a
more refined gentle curve some of the

00:09:03.050 --> 00:09:03.060
more refined gentle curve some of the
 

00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:04.460
more refined gentle curve some of the
shapes were maybe a little bit unusual

00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:04.470
shapes were maybe a little bit unusual
 

00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:07.730
shapes were maybe a little bit unusual
like the K's and the capital R and those

00:09:07.730 --> 00:09:07.740
like the K's and the capital R and those
 

00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:09.650
like the K's and the capital R and those
have become kind of more simplified and

00:09:09.650 --> 00:09:09.660
have become kind of more simplified and
 

00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:11.870
have become kind of more simplified and
more streamlined and we also went from a

00:09:11.870 --> 00:09:11.880
more streamlined and we also went from a
 

00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:15.380
more streamlined and we also went from a
square dot on the i's and J's to a round

00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:15.390
square dot on the i's and J's to a round
 

00:09:15.390 --> 00:09:17.780
square dot on the i's and J's to a round
on so it's just it's an evolution it's a

00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:17.790
on so it's just it's an evolution it's a
 

00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:20.900
on so it's just it's an evolution it's a
more refined form of the original kind

00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:20.910
more refined form of the original kind
 

00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:25.690
more refined form of the original kind
of you know design it's very central to

00:09:25.690 --> 00:09:25.700
of you know design it's very central to
 

00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:28.520
of you know design it's very central to
to Android and very central of course to

00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:28.530
to Android and very central of course to
 

00:09:28.530 --> 00:09:31.550
to Android and very central of course to
material design so you know I talked

00:09:31.550 --> 00:09:31.560
material design so you know I talked
 

00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:33.590
material design so you know I talked
about the global reach of the Android we

00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:33.600
about the global reach of the Android we
 

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:35.120
about the global reach of the Android we
talked about a lot about the next

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:35.130
talked about a lot about the next
 

00:09:35.130 --> 00:09:37.700
talked about a lot about the next
billion users and you know they're

00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:37.710
billion users and you know they're
 

00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:40.120
billion users and you know they're
they're like we heard in the previous

00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:40.130
they're like we heard in the previous
 

00:09:40.130 --> 00:09:44.090
they're like we heard in the previous
you know talk about you know how do you

00:09:44.090 --> 00:09:44.100
you know talk about you know how do you
 

00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:45.530
you know talk about you know how do you
reach them through the Play Store a

00:09:45.530 --> 00:09:45.540
reach them through the Play Store a
 

00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:48.080
reach them through the Play Store a
console but there's also a lot that you

00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:48.090
console but there's also a lot that you
 

00:09:48.090 --> 00:09:49.970
console but there's also a lot that you
have to do with the presentation of text

00:09:49.970 --> 00:09:49.980
have to do with the presentation of text
 

00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:53.060
have to do with the presentation of text
and language in these devices so again

00:09:53.060 --> 00:09:53.070

Roboto to dramatically increases the

00:09:55.370 --> 00:09:55.380
Roboto to dramatically increases the
 

00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:57.980
Roboto to dramatically increases the
Unicode coverage and you can see this is

00:09:57.980 --> 00:09:57.990
Unicode coverage and you can see this is
 

00:09:57.990 --> 00:09:59.690
Unicode coverage and you can see this is
just a sample this is just one of the

00:09:59.690 --> 00:09:59.700
just a sample this is just one of the
 

00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:03.170
just a sample this is just one of the
pages of kind of additional extended

00:10:03.170 --> 00:10:03.180
pages of kind of additional extended
 

00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:05.180
pages of kind of additional extended
Latin characters and another thing I'll

00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:05.190
Latin characters and another thing I'll
 

00:10:05.190 --> 00:10:06.920
Latin characters and another thing I'll
point out just you know for this slide

00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:06.930
point out just you know for this slide
 

00:10:06.930 --> 00:10:10.130
point out just you know for this slide
summit like if you look kind of near the

00:10:10.130 --> 00:10:10.140
summit like if you look kind of near the
 

00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:12.590
summit like if you look kind of near the
middle on towards the left-hand side you

00:10:12.590 --> 00:10:12.600
middle on towards the left-hand side you
 

00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:16.720
middle on towards the left-hand side you
see some O's with some EE stacked

00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:16.730
see some O's with some EE stacked
 

00:10:16.730 --> 00:10:19.520
see some O's with some EE stacked
accents and that's a very common pattern

00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:19.530
accents and that's a very common pattern
 

00:10:19.530 --> 00:10:21.890
accents and that's a very common pattern
in a lot of languages but not not

00:10:21.890 --> 00:10:21.900
in a lot of languages but not not
 

00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:23.690
in a lot of languages but not not
European languages that we're used to so

00:10:23.690 --> 00:10:23.700
European languages that we're used to so
 

00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:25.880
European languages that we're used to so
you see it in Vietnamese and some of

00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:25.890
you see it in Vietnamese and some of
 

00:10:25.890 --> 00:10:27.470
you see it in Vietnamese and some of
these other languages so you really when

00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:27.480
these other languages so you really when
 

00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:29.360
these other languages so you really when
you're when you're designing your apps

00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:29.370
you're when you're designing your apps
 

00:10:29.370 --> 00:10:31.340
you're when you're designing your apps
when you're testing your apps you really

00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:31.350
when you're testing your apps you really
 

00:10:31.350 --> 00:10:34.010
when you're testing your apps you really
need to be careful to test them in some

00:10:34.010 --> 00:10:34.020
need to be careful to test them in some
 

00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:35.810
need to be careful to test them in some
of these other languages to make sure

00:10:35.810 --> 00:10:35.820
of these other languages to make sure
 

00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:37.610
of these other languages to make sure
that you've got enough vertical space

00:10:37.610 --> 00:10:37.620
that you've got enough vertical space
 

00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:39.950
that you've got enough vertical space
this is kind of one of the one of the

00:10:39.950 --> 00:10:39.960
this is kind of one of the one of the
 

00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:42.740
this is kind of one of the one of the
real key takeaways that if you just

00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:42.750
real key takeaways that if you just
 

00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:44.360
real key takeaways that if you just
design in English you've got these

00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:44.370
design in English you've got these
 

00:10:44.370 --> 00:10:45.770
design in English you've got these
letters they don't have anything going

00:10:45.770 --> 00:10:45.780
letters they don't have anything going
 

00:10:45.780 --> 00:10:47.330
letters they don't have anything going
on above they don't have anything going

00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:47.340
on above they don't have anything going
 

00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:49.820
on above they don't have anything going
on below but that is not the experience

00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:49.830
on below but that is not the experience
 

00:10:49.830 --> 00:10:53.750
on below but that is not the experience
of you know the millions hundreds of

00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:53.760
of you know the millions hundreds of
 

00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:56.750
of you know the millions hundreds of
millions of people around the world so

00:10:56.750 --> 00:10:56.760
millions of people around the world so
 

00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:58.490
millions of people around the world so
in addition to Latin Greek and Cyrillic

00:10:58.490 --> 00:10:58.500
in addition to Latin Greek and Cyrillic
 

00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:01.100
in addition to Latin Greek and Cyrillic
there's this huge diversity of other

00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:01.110
there's this huge diversity of other
 

00:11:01.110 --> 00:11:02.810
there's this huge diversity of other
languages and in fact this is the list

00:11:02.810 --> 00:11:02.820
languages and in fact this is the list
 

00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:04.850
languages and in fact this is the list
of scripts not even languages there's

00:11:04.850 --> 00:11:04.860
of scripts not even languages there's
 

00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:06.500
of scripts not even languages there's
many scripts that support multiple

00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:06.510
many scripts that support multiple
 

00:11:06.510 --> 00:11:08.030
many scripts that support multiple
languages

00:11:08.030 --> 00:11:08.040
languages
 

00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:10.519
languages
these are the no tow scripts that we're

00:11:10.519 --> 00:11:10.529
these are the no tow scripts that we're
 

00:11:10.529 --> 00:11:12.769
these are the no tow scripts that we're
supporting in marshmallow so it really

00:11:12.769 --> 00:11:12.779
supporting in marshmallow so it really
 

00:11:12.779 --> 00:11:15.800
supporting in marshmallow so it really
is you know huge expansion compared with

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:15.810
is you know huge expansion compared with
 

00:11:15.810 --> 00:11:17.990
is you know huge expansion compared with
previous versions of Android and it

00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:18.000
previous versions of Android and it
 

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.180
previous versions of Android and it
really covers a very large fraction of

00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:20.190
really covers a very large fraction of
 

00:11:20.190 --> 00:11:22.759
really covers a very large fraction of
the languages that are spoken in the

00:11:22.759 --> 00:11:22.769
the languages that are spoken in the
 

00:11:22.769 --> 00:11:25.189
the languages that are spoken in the
world and so here three scripts that I

00:11:25.189 --> 00:11:25.199
world and so here three scripts that I
 

00:11:25.199 --> 00:11:26.840
world and so here three scripts that I
just kind of picked out you know is

00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:26.850
just kind of picked out you know is
 

00:11:26.850 --> 00:11:30.079
just kind of picked out you know is
representative I you know I find I find

00:11:30.079 --> 00:11:30.089
representative I you know I find I find
 

00:11:30.089 --> 00:11:31.519
representative I you know I find I find
these just really beautiful and you can

00:11:31.519 --> 00:11:31.529
these just really beautiful and you can
 

00:11:31.529 --> 00:11:33.829
these just really beautiful and you can
see you know kind of a tension between

00:11:33.829 --> 00:11:33.839
see you know kind of a tension between
 

00:11:33.839 --> 00:11:36.800
see you know kind of a tension between
classical forms but also trying to make

00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:36.810
classical forms but also trying to make
 

00:11:36.810 --> 00:11:39.410
classical forms but also trying to make
them consistent with the kind of clean

00:11:39.410 --> 00:11:39.420
them consistent with the kind of clean
 

00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:41.030
them consistent with the kind of clean
you know

00:11:41.030 --> 00:11:41.040
you know
 

00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:44.360
you know
Roboto design and so I think these are

00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:44.370
Roboto design and so I think these are
 

00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:46.840
Roboto design and so I think these are
these three are either new in either

00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:46.850
these three are either new in either
 

00:11:46.850 --> 00:11:52.009
these three are either new in either
marshmallow or lollipop so then in

00:11:52.009 --> 00:11:52.019
marshmallow or lollipop so then in
 

00:11:52.019 --> 00:11:55.280
marshmallow or lollipop so then in
addition to you know this kind of large

00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:55.290
addition to you know this kind of large
 

00:11:55.290 --> 00:11:58.220
addition to you know this kind of large
set of scripts CJK chinese japanese and

00:11:58.220 --> 00:11:58.230
set of scripts CJK chinese japanese and
 

00:11:58.230 --> 00:12:01.069
set of scripts CJK chinese japanese and
korean represent a very large fraction

00:12:01.069 --> 00:12:01.079
korean represent a very large fraction
 

00:12:01.079 --> 00:12:05.120
korean represent a very large fraction
of the of the users of Android a lot a

00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:05.130
of the of the users of Android a lot a
 

00:12:05.130 --> 00:12:08.319
of the of the users of Android a lot a
lot of the users in the world and so in

00:12:08.319 --> 00:12:08.329
lot of the users in the world and so in
 

00:12:08.329 --> 00:12:11.689
lot of the users in the world and so in
lollipop we launched Noto CJK which is a

00:12:11.689 --> 00:12:11.699
lollipop we launched Noto CJK which is a
 

00:12:11.699 --> 00:12:14.449
lollipop we launched Noto CJK which is a
joint project with Adobe so it's also

00:12:14.449 --> 00:12:14.459
joint project with Adobe so it's also
 

00:12:14.459 --> 00:12:16.790
joint project with Adobe so it's also
out there you know they released it as

00:12:16.790 --> 00:12:16.800
out there you know they released it as
 

00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:18.980
out there you know they released it as
source hans hands and that's also an

00:12:18.980 --> 00:12:18.990
source hans hands and that's also an
 

00:12:18.990 --> 00:12:20.540
source hans hands and that's also an
open source project and it has a tracker

00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:20.550
open source project and it has a tracker
 

00:12:20.550 --> 00:12:23.210
open source project and it has a tracker
it's very active people you know find

00:12:23.210 --> 00:12:23.220
it's very active people you know find
 

00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:25.759
it's very active people you know find
issues and and you know it's it's being

00:12:25.759 --> 00:12:25.769
issues and and you know it's it's being
 

00:12:25.769 --> 00:12:30.650
issues and and you know it's it's being
revised and in addition to just the the

00:12:30.650 --> 00:12:30.660
revised and in addition to just the the
 

00:12:30.660 --> 00:12:33.410
revised and in addition to just the the
fonts that project also kind of brought

00:12:33.410 --> 00:12:33.420
fonts that project also kind of brought
 

00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:36.170
fonts that project also kind of brought
with it a high quality renderer for

00:12:36.170 --> 00:12:36.180
with it a high quality renderer for
 

00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:38.780
with it a high quality renderer for
something called cff compact font format

00:12:38.780 --> 00:12:38.790
something called cff compact font format
 

00:12:38.790 --> 00:12:41.120
something called cff compact font format
and this is this is based on the Adobe

00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:41.130
and this is this is based on the Adobe
 

00:12:41.130 --> 00:12:43.699
and this is this is based on the Adobe
code but it's now been open sourced as

00:12:43.699 --> 00:12:43.709
code but it's now been open sourced as
 

00:12:43.709 --> 00:12:46.610
code but it's now been open sourced as
part of freetype so you can you can you

00:12:46.610 --> 00:12:46.620
part of freetype so you can you can you
 

00:12:46.620 --> 00:12:48.740
part of freetype so you can you can you
know go look at the code use that in

00:12:48.740 --> 00:12:48.750
know go look at the code use that in
 

00:12:48.750 --> 00:12:50.030
know go look at the code use that in
your own projects as well

00:12:50.030 --> 00:12:50.040
your own projects as well
 

00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:53.090
your own projects as well
so notice ejk is is a very ambitious

00:12:53.090 --> 00:12:53.100
so notice ejk is is a very ambitious
 

00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:55.970
so notice ejk is is a very ambitious
project that it really is is designed to

00:12:55.970 --> 00:12:55.980
project that it really is is designed to
 

00:12:55.980 --> 00:12:58.490
project that it really is is designed to
be a comprehensive support font to

00:12:58.490 --> 00:12:58.500
be a comprehensive support font to
 

00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:02.269
be a comprehensive support font to
support all of CJK and that includes the

00:13:02.269 --> 00:13:02.279
support all of CJK and that includes the
 

00:13:02.279 --> 00:13:07.340
support all of CJK and that includes the
different the different local forms so

00:13:07.340 --> 00:13:07.350
different the different local forms so
 

00:13:07.350 --> 00:13:09.230
different the different local forms so
there's a difference between simplified

00:13:09.230 --> 00:13:09.240
there's a difference between simplified
 

00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:11.449
there's a difference between simplified
and traditional Chinese those are

00:13:11.449 --> 00:13:11.459
and traditional Chinese those are
 

00:13:11.459 --> 00:13:13.069
and traditional Chinese those are
different from Japanese and then there

00:13:13.069 --> 00:13:13.079
different from Japanese and then there
 

00:13:13.079 --> 00:13:15.079
different from Japanese and then there
are some glyphs that appear different in

00:13:15.079 --> 00:13:15.089
are some glyphs that appear different in
 

00:13:15.089 --> 00:13:16.699
are some glyphs that appear different in
Korean and it's very important to these

00:13:16.699 --> 00:13:16.709
Korean and it's very important to these
 

00:13:16.709 --> 00:13:19.519
Korean and it's very important to these
users to see the correct form in their

00:13:19.519 --> 00:13:19.529
users to see the correct form in their
 

00:13:19.529 --> 00:13:21.740
users to see the correct form in their
language if you see it wrong it's it

00:13:21.740 --> 00:13:21.750
language if you see it wrong it's it
 

00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:25.160
language if you see it wrong it's it
just it really is a Polish problem so

00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:25.170
just it really is a Polish problem so
 

00:13:25.170 --> 00:13:27.620
just it really is a Polish problem so
notice cgk has a unified design there's

00:13:27.620 --> 00:13:27.630
notice cgk has a unified design there's
 

00:13:27.630 --> 00:13:29.600
notice cgk has a unified design there's
like a consistent like there's some

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:29.610
like a consistent like there's some
 

00:13:29.610 --> 00:13:30.920
like a consistent like there's some
releases that we've done where the

00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:30.930
releases that we've done where the
 

00:13:30.930 --> 00:13:33.050
releases that we've done where the
chinese and japanese really don't look

00:13:33.050 --> 00:13:33.060
chinese and japanese really don't look
 

00:13:33.060 --> 00:13:35.150
chinese and japanese really don't look
like they're part of the same family of

00:13:35.150 --> 00:13:35.160
like they're part of the same family of
 

00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:37.730
like they're part of the same family of
fonts and in Noto CJK we really have a

00:13:37.730 --> 00:13:37.740
fonts and in Noto CJK we really have a
 

00:13:37.740 --> 00:13:40.970
fonts and in Noto CJK we really have a
unified design but we have the different

00:13:40.970 --> 00:13:40.980
unified design but we have the different
 

00:13:40.980 --> 00:13:45.410
unified design but we have the different
variants in the different regions so no

00:13:45.410 --> 00:13:45.420
variants in the different regions so no
 

00:13:45.420 --> 00:13:47.810
variants in the different regions so no
discussion of text is is complete today

00:13:47.810 --> 00:13:47.820
discussion of text is is complete today
 

00:13:47.820 --> 00:13:50.660
discussion of text is is complete today
without talking about emoji and we

00:13:50.660 --> 00:13:50.670
without talking about emoji and we
 

00:13:50.670 --> 00:13:52.850
without talking about emoji and we
really treat we really treat emoji as

00:13:52.850 --> 00:13:52.860
really treat we really treat emoji as
 

00:13:52.860 --> 00:13:55.160
really treat we really treat emoji as
you know a type of text so an app

00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:55.170
you know a type of text so an app
 

00:13:55.170 --> 00:13:57.320
you know a type of text so an app
doesn't have to do anything special an

00:13:57.320 --> 00:13:57.330
doesn't have to do anything special an
 

00:13:57.330 --> 00:13:59.540
doesn't have to do anything special an
app doesn't have to say oh you know show

00:13:59.540 --> 00:13:59.550
app doesn't have to say oh you know show
 

00:13:59.550 --> 00:14:02.480
app doesn't have to say oh you know show
me some color images here or something

00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:02.490
me some color images here or something
 

00:14:02.490 --> 00:14:04.070
me some color images here or something
like that it just you just represent

00:14:04.070 --> 00:14:04.080
like that it just you just represent
 

00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:05.690
like that it just you just represent
text and you ask for the text to be

00:14:05.690 --> 00:14:05.700
text and you ask for the text to be
 

00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:09.260
text and you ask for the text to be
drawn or in a text view or edited and it

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:09.270
drawn or in a text view or edited and it
 

00:14:09.270 --> 00:14:11.330
drawn or in a text view or edited and it
just automatically shows up using this

00:14:11.330 --> 00:14:11.340
just automatically shows up using this
 

00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:13.760
just automatically shows up using this
color font technology which is now

00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:13.770
color font technology which is now
 

00:14:13.770 --> 00:14:17.120
color font technology which is now
standardized in OpenType 1.7 so and and

00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:17.130
standardized in OpenType 1.7 so and and
 

00:14:17.130 --> 00:14:20.330
standardized in OpenType 1.7 so and and
there are actually many tools many font

00:14:20.330 --> 00:14:20.340
there are actually many tools many font
 

00:14:20.340 --> 00:14:22.940
there are actually many tools many font
editors actually will create fonts in

00:14:22.940 --> 00:14:22.950
editors actually will create fonts in
 

00:14:22.950 --> 00:14:26.560
editors actually will create fonts in
this emoji form so if you want to or I

00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:26.570
this emoji form so if you want to or I
 

00:14:26.570 --> 00:14:29.660
this emoji form so if you want to or I
should say in a color font form whether

00:14:29.660 --> 00:14:29.670
should say in a color font form whether
 

00:14:29.670 --> 00:14:32.000
should say in a color font form whether
it's used for emoji or not is is really

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:32.010
it's used for emoji or not is is really
 

00:14:32.010 --> 00:14:36.110
it's used for emoji or not is is really
up to you and you can you can

00:14:36.110 --> 00:14:36.120
up to you and you can you can
 

00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:37.880
up to you and you can you can
incorporate these custom fonts in your

00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:37.890
incorporate these custom fonts in your
 

00:14:37.890 --> 00:14:40.310
incorporate these custom fonts in your
app and get color color representation

00:14:40.310 --> 00:14:40.320
app and get color color representation
 

00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:43.520
app and get color color representation
of either emoji or text just by dropping

00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:43.530
of either emoji or text just by dropping
 

00:14:43.530 --> 00:14:47.870
of either emoji or text just by dropping
in the font this also supports flags and

00:14:47.870 --> 00:14:47.880
in the font this also supports flags and
 

00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:50.660
in the font this also supports flags and
key caps it's a it's a more expanded set

00:14:50.660 --> 00:14:50.670
key caps it's a it's a more expanded set
 

00:14:50.670 --> 00:14:54.260
key caps it's a it's a more expanded set
of of emoji and one of the new API is I

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:54.270
of of emoji and one of the new API is I
 

00:14:54.270 --> 00:14:56.300
of of emoji and one of the new API is I
should say this is a marshmallow API

00:14:56.300 --> 00:14:56.310
should say this is a marshmallow API
 

00:14:56.310 --> 00:14:59.210
should say this is a marshmallow API
that a lot of apps you you want to know

00:14:59.210 --> 00:14:59.220
that a lot of apps you you want to know
 

00:14:59.220 --> 00:15:01.850
that a lot of apps you you want to know
what emoji are present because you want

00:15:01.850 --> 00:15:01.860
what emoji are present because you want
 

00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:03.290
what emoji are present because you want
to make a decision do you present this

00:15:03.290 --> 00:15:03.300
to make a decision do you present this
 

00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:05.930
to make a decision do you present this
as a you know as a palette for users to

00:15:05.930 --> 00:15:05.940
as a you know as a palette for users to
 

00:15:05.940 --> 00:15:08.150
as a you know as a palette for users to
choose and this has always been a

00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:08.160
choose and this has always been a
 

00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:09.470
choose and this has always been a
problem because you know different

00:15:09.470 --> 00:15:09.480
problem because you know different
 

00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:11.000
problem because you know different
phones will have different emoji sets

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:11.010
phones will have different emoji sets
 

00:15:11.010 --> 00:15:13.970
phones will have different emoji sets
and you know as we're upgrading it's

00:15:13.970 --> 00:15:13.980
and you know as we're upgrading it's
 

00:15:13.980 --> 00:15:15.829
and you know as we're upgrading it's
it's hard to know is this emoji present

00:15:15.829 --> 00:15:15.839
it's hard to know is this emoji present
 

00:15:15.839 --> 00:15:18.020
it's hard to know is this emoji present
or not or does this flag exist in the

00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:18.030
or not or does this flag exist in the
 

00:15:18.030 --> 00:15:20.780
or not or does this flag exist in the
case of the flag emoji and so we've got

00:15:20.780 --> 00:15:20.790
case of the flag emoji and so we've got
 

00:15:20.790 --> 00:15:22.460
case of the flag emoji and so we've got
this new API that will tell you it's

00:15:22.460 --> 00:15:22.470
this new API that will tell you it's
 

00:15:22.470 --> 00:15:24.230
this new API that will tell you it's
very fast and we really recommend we

00:15:24.230 --> 00:15:24.240
very fast and we really recommend we
 

00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:26.930
very fast and we really recommend we
really want you to be using has glyphs

00:15:26.930 --> 00:15:26.940
really want you to be using has glyphs
 

00:15:26.940 --> 00:15:28.970
really want you to be using has glyphs
so you know what emoji are on your on

00:15:28.970 --> 00:15:28.980
so you know what emoji are on your on
 

00:15:28.980 --> 00:15:33.290
so you know what emoji are on your on
your device what you what you can use so

00:15:33.290 --> 00:15:33.300
your device what you what you can use so
 

00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:35.060
your device what you what you can use so
then I want to talk about some

00:15:35.060 --> 00:15:35.070
then I want to talk about some
 

00:15:35.070 --> 00:15:37.040
then I want to talk about some
the typography features we've really

00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:37.050
the typography features we've really
 

00:15:37.050 --> 00:15:39.290
the typography features we've really
been expanding this you know the goal my

00:15:39.290 --> 00:15:39.300
been expanding this you know the goal my
 

00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:41.600
been expanding this you know the goal my
goal certainly is to make Android

00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:41.610
goal certainly is to make Android
 

00:15:41.610 --> 00:15:45.230
goal certainly is to make Android
typography match what you can do on the

00:15:45.230 --> 00:15:45.240
typography match what you can do on the
 

00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:47.360
typography match what you can do on the
web and match what you can do not just

00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:47.370
web and match what you can do not just
 

00:15:47.370 --> 00:15:48.620
web and match what you can do not just
in print but like really high quality

00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:48.630
in print but like really high quality
 

00:15:48.630 --> 00:15:50.390
in print but like really high quality
print and so I'll walk you through some

00:15:50.390 --> 00:15:50.400
print and so I'll walk you through some
 

00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:54.050
print and so I'll walk you through some
of the things that we do here I'll just

00:15:54.050 --> 00:15:54.060
of the things that we do here I'll just
 

00:15:54.060 --> 00:15:55.820
of the things that we do here I'll just
go through this list and then I'll show

00:15:55.820 --> 00:15:55.830
go through this list and then I'll show
 

00:15:55.830 --> 00:15:57.950
go through this list and then I'll show
some examples that we we have kerning

00:15:57.950 --> 00:15:57.960
some examples that we we have kerning
 

00:15:57.960 --> 00:16:00.100
some examples that we we have kerning
and ligatures we've actually had those

00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:00.110
and ligatures we've actually had those
 

00:16:00.110 --> 00:16:03.440
and ligatures we've actually had those
since I think jellybean mr2 but now

00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:03.450
since I think jellybean mr2 but now
 

00:16:03.450 --> 00:16:05.030
since I think jellybean mr2 but now
there's more control so if you want to

00:16:05.030 --> 00:16:05.040
there's more control so if you want to
 

00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:06.500
there's more control so if you want to
turn those on and off there's fine

00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:06.510
turn those on and off there's fine
 

00:16:06.510 --> 00:16:08.870
turn those on and off there's fine
grained control to do that we have this

00:16:08.870 --> 00:16:08.880
grained control to do that we have this
 

00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:14.530
grained control to do that we have this
font feature settings attribute where

00:16:14.530 --> 00:16:14.540
font feature settings attribute where
 

00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:16.940
font feature settings attribute where
you really can go in and control the

00:16:16.940 --> 00:16:16.950
you really can go in and control the
 

00:16:16.950 --> 00:16:19.010
you really can go in and control the
open type features I'll give you several

00:16:19.010 --> 00:16:19.020
open type features I'll give you several
 

00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:21.440
open type features I'll give you several
examples of that and that's using a CSS

00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:21.450
examples of that and that's using a CSS
 

00:16:21.450 --> 00:16:22.940
examples of that and that's using a CSS
compatible syntax so we want to make

00:16:22.940 --> 00:16:22.950
compatible syntax so we want to make
 

00:16:22.950 --> 00:16:24.860
compatible syntax so we want to make
this stuff so you know if your designers

00:16:24.860 --> 00:16:24.870
this stuff so you know if your designers
 

00:16:24.870 --> 00:16:28.220
this stuff so you know if your designers
are you know used to controlling

00:16:28.220 --> 00:16:28.230
are you know used to controlling
 

00:16:28.230 --> 00:16:29.840
are you know used to controlling
typography on the web we want to make

00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:29.850
typography on the web we want to make
 

00:16:29.850 --> 00:16:31.790
typography on the web we want to make
that kind of impedance mismatch as

00:16:31.790 --> 00:16:31.800
that kind of impedance mismatch as
 

00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:35.780
that kind of impedance mismatch as
smooth as possible so so you can just

00:16:35.780 --> 00:16:35.790
smooth as possible so so you can just
 

00:16:35.790 --> 00:16:37.550
smooth as possible so so you can just
take that knowledge and apply it to

00:16:37.550 --> 00:16:37.560
take that knowledge and apply it to
 

00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:39.530
take that knowledge and apply it to
Android apps and then this is a little

00:16:39.530 --> 00:16:39.540
Android apps and then this is a little
 

00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:41.150
Android apps and then this is a little
bit more technical thing but we use open

00:16:41.150 --> 00:16:41.160
bit more technical thing but we use open
 

00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:43.880
bit more technical thing but we use open
type integrally to give you these

00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:43.890
type integrally to give you these
 

00:16:43.890 --> 00:16:46.610
type integrally to give you these
localized forms that there many

00:16:46.610 --> 00:16:46.620

Japanese in Korea and where there's
 

00:16:50.190 --> 00:16:52.940

going to be subtle differences the same

00:16:52.940 --> 00:16:52.950
going to be subtle differences the same
 

00:16:52.950 --> 00:16:54.860
going to be subtle differences the same
basic script but differences in the way

00:16:54.860 --> 00:16:54.870
basic script but differences in the way
 

00:16:54.870 --> 00:16:56.930

it's presented and we use open type to

00:16:56.930 --> 00:16:56.940
it's presented and we use open type to
 

00:16:56.940 --> 00:16:59.840
it's presented and we use open type to
control that and I'll talk a little bit

00:16:59.840 --> 00:16:59.850
control that and I'll talk a little bit
 

00:16:59.850 --> 00:17:02.090
control that and I'll talk a little bit
also about what you want to do in your

00:17:02.090 --> 00:17:02.100
also about what you want to do in your
 

00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:04.750
also about what you want to do in your
app to make that work perfectly so

00:17:04.750 --> 00:17:04.760
app to make that work perfectly so
 

00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:07.490
app to make that work perfectly so
kerning in ligatures so the FI ligature

kerning in ligatures so the FI ligature
 

00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:10.579
kerning in ligatures so the FI ligature
is a little controversial in Roboto not

everybody loves this but but it is

00:17:13.010 --> 00:17:13.020
everybody loves this but but it is
 

00:17:13.020 --> 00:17:15.949
everybody loves this but but it is
definitely a sign of kind of more

00:17:15.949 --> 00:17:15.959
definitely a sign of kind of more
 

00:17:15.959 --> 00:17:18.170
definitely a sign of kind of more
sophisticated sophisticated typography

00:17:18.170 --> 00:17:18.180
sophisticated sophisticated typography
 

00:17:18.180 --> 00:17:20.480
sophisticated sophisticated typography
that you don't just put the letters that

00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:20.490
that you don't just put the letters that
 

00:17:20.490 --> 00:17:22.069
that you don't just put the letters that
in some cases you have these

00:17:22.069 --> 00:17:22.079
in some cases you have these
 

00:17:22.079 --> 00:17:24.199
in some cases you have these
combinations and you have a specifically

00:17:24.199 --> 00:17:24.209
combinations and you have a specifically
 

00:17:24.209 --> 00:17:25.939
combinations and you have a specifically
drawn glyph that represents more than

00:17:25.939 --> 00:17:25.949
drawn glyph that represents more than
 

00:17:25.949 --> 00:17:29.120
drawn glyph that represents more than
one letter and this is certainly you

00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:29.130
one letter and this is certainly you
 

00:17:29.130 --> 00:17:31.640
one letter and this is certainly you
know this exists in Roboto and it's a

00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:31.650
know this exists in Roboto and it's a
 

00:17:31.650 --> 00:17:33.730
know this exists in Roboto and it's a
very important part like especially in

00:17:33.730 --> 00:17:33.740
very important part like especially in
 

00:17:33.740 --> 00:17:36.320
very important part like especially in
serif fonts you really need those

00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:36.330
serif fonts you really need those
 

00:17:36.330 --> 00:17:38.000
serif fonts you really need those
ligatures for the font to display

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:38.010
ligatures for the font to display
 

00:17:38.010 --> 00:17:40.460

correctly so if again as you're using

00:17:40.460 --> 00:17:40.470
correctly so if again as you're using
 

00:17:40.470 --> 00:17:43.070
correctly so if again as you're using
custom fonts in your app you want those

00:17:43.070 --> 00:17:43.080
custom fonts in your app you want those
 

00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:45.320
custom fonts in your app you want those
ligatures and the same is true for

00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:45.330
ligatures and the same is true for
 

00:17:45.330 --> 00:17:47.120
ligatures and the same is true for
kerning you almost never want to turn

00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:47.130
kerning you almost never want to turn
 

00:17:47.130 --> 00:17:48.470
kerning you almost never want to turn
this off the only time you might

00:17:48.470 --> 00:17:48.480
this off the only time you might
 

00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:49.549
this off the only time you might
want to turn it off is if you've got

00:17:49.549 --> 00:17:49.559
want to turn it off is if you've got
 

00:17:49.559 --> 00:17:51.770
want to turn it off is if you've got
some kind of technical alignment where

00:17:51.770 --> 00:17:51.780
some kind of technical alignment where
 

00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:53.510
some kind of technical alignment where
things need to have the consistent with

font feature setting attribute you can
control these these are actually

00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:04.290
control these these are actually
 

00:18:04.290 --> 00:18:06.549
control these these are actually
implemented as open type features and

00:18:06.549 --> 00:18:06.559
implemented as open type features and
 

00:18:06.559 --> 00:18:09.289
implemented as open type features and
with as with any open type feature you

00:18:09.289 --> 00:18:09.299
with as with any open type feature you
 

00:18:09.299 --> 00:18:11.419

can turn it on or off with font feature
 

00:18:11.429 --> 00:18:13.490
can turn it on or off with font feature
settings and that's a that's actually a

proportional and old-style numbers and
 

00:18:23.669 --> 00:18:25.760
proportional and old-style numbers and
these are really important for kind of a

00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:25.770
these are really important for kind of a
 

00:18:25.770 --> 00:18:28.039
these are really important for kind of a
more refined sophisticated typography

know paragraphs of text then

00:18:52.190 --> 00:18:52.200
know paragraphs of text then
 

00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:54.919
know paragraphs of text then
proportional is a maybe a more subtle

00:18:54.919 --> 00:18:54.929
proportional is a maybe a more subtle
 

00:18:54.929 --> 00:18:57.710
proportional is a maybe a more subtle
change where you just give the one a

00:18:57.710 --> 00:18:57.720
change where you just give the one a
 

00:18:57.720 --> 00:18:59.330
change where you just give the one a
little bit narrower so you don't have

00:18:59.330 --> 00:18:59.340
little bit narrower so you don't have
 

00:18:59.340 --> 00:19:01.250
little bit narrower so you don't have
all these space around it and then if

00:19:01.250 --> 00:19:01.260
all these space around it and then if
 

00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:02.840
all these space around it and then if
you're really trying to do something

00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:02.850
you're really trying to do something
 

00:19:02.850 --> 00:19:05.120
you're really trying to do something
that looks more like a book something

00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:05.130
that looks more like a book something
 

00:19:05.130 --> 00:19:06.590
that looks more like a book something
that looks more like traditional

00:19:06.590 --> 00:19:06.600
that looks more like traditional
 

00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:08.299
that looks more like traditional
typography then you've got these

00:19:08.299 --> 00:19:08.309
typography then you've got these
 

00:19:08.309 --> 00:19:11.510
typography then you've got these
old-style figures and those are in

00:19:11.510 --> 00:19:11.520
old-style figures and those are in
 

00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:13.610
old-style figures and those are in
Roboto too those are present in the font

00:19:13.610 --> 00:19:13.620
Roboto too those are present in the font
 

00:19:13.620 --> 00:19:15.350
Roboto too those are present in the font
and you use the Android font feature

00:19:15.350 --> 00:19:15.360
and you use the Android font feature
 

00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:18.140
and you use the Android font feature
settings to select P non-proportional

00:19:18.140 --> 00:19:18.150

plus feature another another feature

00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:39.570
plus feature another another feature
 

00:19:39.570 --> 00:19:43.490
plus feature another another feature
that I think is really powerful tool for

00:19:43.490 --> 00:19:43.500
that I think is really powerful tool for
 

00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:46.250
that I think is really powerful tool for
bringing kind of more sophisticated

00:19:46.250 --> 00:19:46.260
bringing kind of more sophisticated
 

00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:49.250
bringing kind of more sophisticated
design to apps is control over letter

00:19:49.250 --> 00:19:49.260
design to apps is control over letter
 

00:19:49.260 --> 00:19:51.350
design to apps is control over letter
spacing so there's a default letter

00:19:51.350 --> 00:19:51.360
spacing so there's a default letter
 

00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:56.030
spacing so there's a default letter
spacing it's really tuned for legibility

00:19:56.030 --> 00:19:56.040
spacing it's really tuned for legibility
 

00:19:56.040 --> 00:19:58.640
spacing it's really tuned for legibility
people are getting information on their

00:19:58.640 --> 00:19:58.650
people are getting information on their
 

00:19:58.650 --> 00:20:00.200
people are getting information on their
phone they need to be able to read it

00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:00.210
phone they need to be able to read it
 

00:20:00.210 --> 00:20:02.450
phone they need to be able to read it
quickly and that's that

00:20:02.450 --> 00:20:02.460
quickly and that's that
 

00:20:02.460 --> 00:20:04.040
quickly and that's that
what the default litter spacing is tuned

00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:04.050
what the default litter spacing is tuned
 

00:20:04.050 --> 00:20:05.690
what the default litter spacing is tuned
for but if you have got something that's

00:20:05.690 --> 00:20:05.700
for but if you have got something that's
 

00:20:05.700 --> 00:20:08.480
for but if you have got something that's
kind of larger more of a branding and

00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:08.490
kind of larger more of a branding and
 

00:20:08.490 --> 00:20:11.870
kind of larger more of a branding and
less of a kind of a functional element

00:20:11.870 --> 00:20:11.880
less of a kind of a functional element
 

00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:15.110
less of a kind of a functional element
then spacing it a little tighter might

00:20:15.110 --> 00:20:15.120
then spacing it a little tighter might
 

00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:17.660
then spacing it a little tighter might
kind of highlight that and then you can

00:20:17.660 --> 00:20:17.670
kind of highlight that and then you can
 

00:20:17.670 --> 00:20:20.780
kind of highlight that and then you can
also use wide spacing as maybe a form of

00:20:20.780 --> 00:20:20.790
also use wide spacing as maybe a form of
 

00:20:20.790 --> 00:20:23.450
also use wide spacing as maybe a form of
emphasis or just bringing a little bit

00:20:23.450 --> 00:20:23.460
emphasis or just bringing a little bit
 

00:20:23.460 --> 00:20:26.420
emphasis or just bringing a little bit
more breadth to your design so you have

00:20:26.420 --> 00:20:26.430
more breadth to your design so you have
 

00:20:26.430 --> 00:20:29.600
more breadth to your design so you have
your you're no longer stuck with just

00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:29.610
your you're no longer stuck with just
 

00:20:29.610 --> 00:20:32.060
your you're no longer stuck with just
the default spacing that's that's set in

00:20:32.060 --> 00:20:32.070
the default spacing that's that's set in
 

00:20:32.070 --> 00:20:34.400
the default spacing that's that's set in
your font and again that's an L plus

00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:34.410
your font and again that's an L plus
 

00:20:34.410 --> 00:20:39.470
your font and again that's an L plus
feature so in marshmallow this is really

00:20:39.470 --> 00:20:39.480
feature so in marshmallow this is really
 

00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:41.860
feature so in marshmallow this is really
one of the things I'm most excited about

00:20:41.860 --> 00:20:41.870
one of the things I'm most excited about
 

00:20:41.870 --> 00:20:45.290
one of the things I'm most excited about
that we we really stepped up the

00:20:45.290 --> 00:20:45.300
that we we really stepped up the
 

00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:48.620
that we we really stepped up the
paragraph layout and you know the the

00:20:48.620 --> 00:20:48.630
paragraph layout and you know the the
 

00:20:48.630 --> 00:20:50.870
paragraph layout and you know the the
old algorithm kind of used you know you

00:20:50.870 --> 00:20:50.880
old algorithm kind of used you know you
 

00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:53.030
old algorithm kind of used you know you
fill up a line and then when once you

00:20:53.030 --> 00:20:53.040
fill up a line and then when once you
 

00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:54.470
fill up a line and then when once you
get to the point where the line is full

00:20:54.470 --> 00:20:54.480
get to the point where the line is full
 

00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:56.870
get to the point where the line is full
then you just break at the word boundary

00:20:56.870 --> 00:20:56.880
then you just break at the word boundary
 

00:20:56.880 --> 00:21:00.470
then you just break at the word boundary
and you keep going but in marshmallow we

00:21:00.470 --> 00:21:00.480
and you keep going but in marshmallow we
 

00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:02.330
and you keep going but in marshmallow we
have this high quality paragraph layout

00:21:02.330 --> 00:21:02.340
have this high quality paragraph layout
 

00:21:02.340 --> 00:21:05.540
have this high quality paragraph layout
mode and it incorporates a couple of

00:21:05.540 --> 00:21:05.550
mode and it incorporates a couple of
 

00:21:05.550 --> 00:21:07.280
mode and it incorporates a couple of
different elements it incorporates

00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:07.290
different elements it incorporates
 

00:21:07.290 --> 00:21:10.160
different elements it incorporates
automatic hyphenation and it also

00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:10.170
automatic hyphenation and it also
 

00:21:10.170 --> 00:21:11.810
automatic hyphenation and it also
incorporates this concept of whole

00:21:11.810 --> 00:21:11.820
incorporates this concept of whole
 

00:21:11.820 --> 00:21:13.760
incorporates this concept of whole
paragraph optimization so it kind of

00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:13.770
paragraph optimization so it kind of
 

00:21:13.770 --> 00:21:16.640
paragraph optimization so it kind of
moves pieces around to get like a best

00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:16.650
moves pieces around to get like a best
 

00:21:16.650 --> 00:21:19.130
moves pieces around to get like a best
score to get a you know there's a

00:21:19.130 --> 00:21:19.140
score to get a you know there's a
 

00:21:19.140 --> 00:21:21.560
score to get a you know there's a
there's kind of a score that tells you

00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:21.570
there's kind of a score that tells you
 

00:21:21.570 --> 00:21:23.690
there's kind of a score that tells you
what is the quality of this layout and

00:21:23.690 --> 00:21:23.700
what is the quality of this layout and
 

00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:24.890
what is the quality of this layout and
it's really trying to optimize that

00:21:24.890 --> 00:21:24.900
it's really trying to optimize that
 

00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:27.140
it's really trying to optimize that
across the entire paragraph both of

00:21:27.140 --> 00:21:27.150
across the entire paragraph both of
 

00:21:27.150 --> 00:21:29.480
across the entire paragraph both of
these algorithms are based on tech which

00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:29.490
these algorithms are based on tech which
 

00:21:29.490 --> 00:21:33.050
these algorithms are based on tech which
is a print typography package it has a

00:21:33.050 --> 00:21:33.060
is a print typography package it has a
 

00:21:33.060 --> 00:21:36.500
is a print typography package it has a
very long history and you know high-end

very long history and you know high-end
 

00:21:36.510 --> 00:21:40.040
very long history and you know high-end
print publishing tools use this same

00:21:40.040 --> 00:21:40.050
print publishing tools use this same
 

00:21:40.050 --> 00:21:42.980
print publishing tools use this same
approach but the parameters you know

00:21:42.980 --> 00:21:42.990
approach but the parameters you know
 

00:21:42.990 --> 00:21:44.990
approach but the parameters you know
like when do you use hyphens hyphens are

00:21:44.990 --> 00:21:45.000
like when do you use hyphens hyphens are
 

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:46.880
like when do you use hyphens hyphens are
a little bit weird people are not used

00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:46.890
a little bit weird people are not used
 

00:21:46.890 --> 00:21:48.610
a little bit weird people are not used
to seeing them on a mobile device

00:21:48.610 --> 00:21:48.620
to seeing them on a mobile device
 

00:21:48.620 --> 00:21:51.020
to seeing them on a mobile device
there's some contexts where they're

00:21:51.020 --> 00:21:51.030
there's some contexts where they're
 

00:21:51.030 --> 00:21:53.000
there's some contexts where they're
where they make a lot of sense like if

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:53.010
where they make a lot of sense like if
 

00:21:53.010 --> 00:21:54.860
where they make a lot of sense like if
you're displaying an e-book for example

00:21:54.860 --> 00:21:54.870
you're displaying an e-book for example
 

00:21:54.870 --> 00:21:56.840
you're displaying an e-book for example
and there's some where maybe it makes a

00:21:56.840 --> 00:21:56.850
and there's some where maybe it makes a
 

00:21:56.850 --> 00:21:58.850
and there's some where maybe it makes a
little less sense like UI strings or

00:21:58.850 --> 00:21:58.860
little less sense like UI strings or
 

00:21:58.860 --> 00:22:00.500
little less sense like UI strings or
maybe chat messages people are not used

00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:00.510
maybe chat messages people are not used
 

00:22:00.510 --> 00:22:03.140
maybe chat messages people are not used
to seeing hyphens there so we tuned the

00:22:03.140 --> 00:22:03.150
to seeing hyphens there so we tuned the
 

00:22:03.150 --> 00:22:04.790
to seeing hyphens there so we tuned the
parameters we you know it's it's

00:22:04.790 --> 00:22:04.800
parameters we you know it's it's
 

00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:11.510
parameters we you know it's it's
heuristics and we kind of chose these so

00:22:11.510 --> 00:22:11.520
heuristics and we kind of chose these so
 

00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:14.150
heuristics and we kind of chose these so
that a couple of things that people were

00:22:14.150 --> 00:22:14.160
that a couple of things that people were
 

00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:15.360
that a couple of things that people were
noticing that if you

00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:15.370
noticing that if you
 

00:22:15.370 --> 00:22:18.360
noticing that if you
- eight and you break a partial word on

00:22:18.360 --> 00:22:18.370
- eight and you break a partial word on
 

00:22:18.370 --> 00:22:22.049
- eight and you break a partial word on
to the last line that is really weird

00:22:22.049 --> 00:22:22.059
to the last line that is really weird
 

00:22:22.059 --> 00:22:24.450
to the last line that is really weird
that's something that people have a

00:22:24.450 --> 00:22:24.460
that's something that people have a
 

00:22:24.460 --> 00:22:26.100
that's something that people have a
negative reaction to so there's a

00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:26.110
negative reaction to so there's a
 

00:22:26.110 --> 00:22:28.980
negative reaction to so there's a
parameter in the tuning that kind of

00:22:28.980 --> 00:22:28.990
parameter in the tuning that kind of
 

00:22:28.990 --> 00:22:31.650
parameter in the tuning that kind of
doesn't do that very often but on the

this high-quality paragraph layout is
you want better information density this

00:22:40.470 --> 00:22:40.480
you want better information density this
 

00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:42.240
you want better information density this
is especially important when you have

00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:42.250
is especially important when you have
 

00:22:42.250 --> 00:22:44.610
is especially important when you have

looking at this particular problem a
very common pattern for UI strings

00:26:14.889 --> 00:26:14.899
very common pattern for UI strings
 

00:26:14.899 --> 00:26:17.379
very common pattern for UI strings
you've got a string that just doesn't

00:26:17.379 --> 00:26:17.389
you've got a string that just doesn't
 

00:26:17.389 --> 00:26:20.109
you've got a string that just doesn't
quite fit into the space into the width

00:26:20.109 --> 00:26:20.119
quite fit into the space into the width
 

00:26:20.119 --> 00:26:22.629
quite fit into the space into the width
of the set and then you get this word

00:26:22.629 --> 00:26:22.639
of the set and then you get this word
 

00:26:22.639 --> 00:26:25.239
of the set and then you get this word
you know UI strings are often very short

00:26:25.239 --> 00:26:25.249
you know UI strings are often very short
 

00:26:25.249 --> 00:26:26.680
you know UI strings are often very short
so this happens like quite a lot where

00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:26.690
so this happens like quite a lot where
 

00:26:26.690 --> 00:26:28.690
so this happens like quite a lot where
you just have one line but you have like

it's wrong things will be you'll still

it's wrong things will be you'll still
 

00:27:44.300 --> 00:27:46.090
it's wrong things will be you'll still
get the text displayed but things will

be degraded they won't be as nice they

won't be as polished as if you set that
locale correctly so there's three

locale correctly so there's three
 

00:27:54.050 --> 00:27:56.500

those letters things like Persian
numerals and so on or not well Persian

00:30:17.010 --> 00:30:17.020
numerals and so on or not well Persian
 

00:30:17.020 --> 00:30:19.260
numerals and so on or not well Persian
numerals are complicated but the point

00:30:19.260 --> 00:30:19.270
numerals are complicated but the point
 

00:30:19.270 --> 00:30:21.750
numerals are complicated but the point
is that you if you know the language

00:30:21.750 --> 00:30:21.760
is that you if you know the language
 

00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:24.270
is that you if you know the language
then setting it will get the correct

00:30:24.270 --> 00:30:24.280
then setting it will get the correct
 

00:30:24.280 --> 00:30:28.350
then setting it will get the correct
lookups to happen on the font the locale

00:30:28.350 --> 00:30:28.360
lookups to happen on the font the locale
 

00:30:28.360 --> 00:30:30.690
lookups to happen on the font the locale
also affects line breaking there's some

00:30:30.690 --> 00:30:30.700
also affects line breaking there's some
 

00:30:30.700 --> 00:30:32.520
also affects line breaking there's some
languages where deciding where the

00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:32.530
languages where deciding where the
 

00:30:32.530 --> 00:30:34.170
languages where deciding where the
boundaries are between words where you

00:30:34.170 --> 00:30:34.180
boundaries are between words where you
 

00:30:34.180 --> 00:30:36.000
boundaries are between words where you
can break the line is actually kind of a

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:36.010
can break the line is actually kind of a
 

00:30:36.010 --> 00:30:38.940
can break the line is actually kind of a
complex question Thai is the most common

00:30:38.940 --> 00:30:38.950
complex question Thai is the most common
 

00:30:38.950 --> 00:30:41.490
complex question Thai is the most common
certainly that you'll see where there's

00:30:41.490 --> 00:30:41.500
certainly that you'll see where there's
 

00:30:41.500 --> 00:30:43.380
certainly that you'll see where there's
no spaces and so you really in the case

00:30:43.380 --> 00:30:43.390
no spaces and so you really in the case
 

00:30:43.390 --> 00:30:45.450
no spaces and so you really in the case
of Thai you need a dictionary you need

00:30:45.450 --> 00:30:45.460
of Thai you need a dictionary you need
 

00:30:45.460 --> 00:30:47.640
of Thai you need a dictionary you need
to say you know this is the word so that

00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:47.650
to say you know this is the word so that
 

00:30:47.650 --> 00:30:49.140
to say you know this is the word so that
I know where the boundaries of the words

00:30:49.140 --> 00:30:49.150
I know where the boundaries of the words
 

00:30:49.150 --> 00:30:51.990
I know where the boundaries of the words
are and that is completely reliant on

00:30:51.990 --> 00:30:52.000
are and that is completely reliant on
 

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:53.910
are and that is completely reliant on
knowing what the language is if you just

00:30:53.910 --> 00:30:53.920
knowing what the language is if you just
 

00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:56.760
knowing what the language is if you just
put Thai text through but don't identify

00:30:56.760 --> 00:30:56.770
put Thai text through but don't identify
 

00:30:56.770 --> 00:30:59.100
put Thai text through but don't identify
that the language is Thai then it gets

00:30:59.100 --> 00:30:59.110
that the language is Thai then it gets
 

00:30:59.110 --> 00:31:01.340
that the language is Thai then it gets
confused and you get line breaks in in

00:31:01.340 --> 00:31:01.350
confused and you get line breaks in in
 

00:31:01.350 --> 00:31:03.780
confused and you get line breaks in in
potentially very bad places that don't

00:31:03.780 --> 00:31:03.790
potentially very bad places that don't
 

00:31:03.790 --> 00:31:06.240
potentially very bad places that don't
don't line up with words at all and then

00:31:06.240 --> 00:31:06.250
don't line up with words at all and then
 

00:31:06.250 --> 00:31:07.409
don't line up with words at all and then
of course lastly

00:31:07.409 --> 00:31:07.419
of course lastly
 

00:31:07.419 --> 00:31:09.899
of course lastly
now that we have automatic hyphenation

00:31:09.899 --> 00:31:09.909
now that we have automatic hyphenation
 

00:31:09.909 --> 00:31:12.509
now that we have automatic hyphenation
that knowing which dictionary of

00:31:12.509 --> 00:31:12.519
that knowing which dictionary of
 

00:31:12.519 --> 00:31:16.319
that knowing which dictionary of
patterns to use depends on the language

00:31:16.319 --> 00:31:16.329
patterns to use depends on the language
 

00:31:16.329 --> 00:31:19.079
patterns to use depends on the language
and if use and this is like most of the

00:31:19.079 --> 00:31:19.089
and if use and this is like most of the
 

00:31:19.089 --> 00:31:20.969
and if use and this is like most of the
things that I just talked about you know

00:31:20.969 --> 00:31:20.979
things that I just talked about you know
 

00:31:20.979 --> 00:31:23.729
things that I just talked about you know
are kind of more exotic languages to to

00:31:23.729 --> 00:31:23.739
are kind of more exotic languages to to
 

00:31:23.739 --> 00:31:25.469
are kind of more exotic languages to to
this audience but automatic hyphenation

00:31:25.469 --> 00:31:25.479
this audience but automatic hyphenation
 

00:31:25.479 --> 00:31:27.629
this audience but automatic hyphenation
is important between you know for

00:31:27.629 --> 00:31:27.639
is important between you know for
 

00:31:27.639 --> 00:31:30.029
is important between you know for
example Norwegian and English they're

00:31:30.029 --> 00:31:30.039
example Norwegian and English they're
 

00:31:30.039 --> 00:31:32.789
example Norwegian and English they're
both in the same script but if you use

00:31:32.789 --> 00:31:32.799
both in the same script but if you use
 

00:31:32.799 --> 00:31:34.259
both in the same script but if you use
the wrong patterns you'll get you'll get

00:31:34.259 --> 00:31:34.269
the wrong patterns you'll get you'll get
 

00:31:34.269 --> 00:31:37.289
the wrong patterns you'll get you'll get
weird - and then there's an you know

00:31:37.289 --> 00:31:37.299
weird - and then there's an you know
 

00:31:37.299 --> 00:31:38.699
weird - and then there's an you know
like there's this like how do you know

00:31:38.699 --> 00:31:38.709
like there's this like how do you know
 

00:31:38.709 --> 00:31:41.060
like there's this like how do you know
what the what the language is and

00:31:41.060 --> 00:31:41.070
what the what the language is and
 

00:31:41.070 --> 00:31:42.839
what the what the language is and
fortunately there is an open source

00:31:42.839 --> 00:31:42.849
fortunately there is an open source
 

00:31:42.849 --> 00:31:45.569
fortunately there is an open source
library I mean this is actually mostly

00:31:45.569 --> 00:31:45.579
library I mean this is actually mostly
 

00:31:45.579 --> 00:31:47.639
library I mean this is actually mostly
developed by Google but it's out there

00:31:47.639 --> 00:31:47.649
developed by Google but it's out there
 

00:31:47.649 --> 00:31:50.669
developed by Google but it's out there
the compact language detector library

00:31:50.669 --> 00:31:50.679
the compact language detector library
 

00:31:50.679 --> 00:31:53.489
the compact language detector library
which is now in its second version as

00:31:53.489 --> 00:31:53.499
which is now in its second version as
 

00:31:53.499 --> 00:31:55.229
which is now in its second version as
open source and it's designed to be very

00:31:55.229 --> 00:31:55.239
open source and it's designed to be very
 

00:31:55.239 --> 00:31:57.180
open source and it's designed to be very
performant very fast it's not a huge

00:31:57.180 --> 00:31:57.190
performant very fast it's not a huge
 

00:31:57.190 --> 00:31:59.279
performant very fast it's not a huge
dependency to take on so if you've got

00:31:59.279 --> 00:31:59.289
dependency to take on so if you've got
 

00:31:59.289 --> 00:32:01.440
dependency to take on so if you've got
an app where you know you're displaying

00:32:01.440 --> 00:32:01.450
an app where you know you're displaying
 

00:32:01.450 --> 00:32:03.899
an app where you know you're displaying
messages and you really don't have the

00:32:03.899 --> 00:32:03.909
messages and you really don't have the
 

00:32:03.909 --> 00:32:06.149
messages and you really don't have the
metadata you don't know what where it

00:32:06.149 --> 00:32:06.159
metadata you don't know what where it
 

00:32:06.159 --> 00:32:07.919
metadata you don't know what where it
came from what that language is but you

00:32:07.919 --> 00:32:07.929
came from what that language is but you
 

00:32:07.929 --> 00:32:10.379
came from what that language is but you
want to ensure that it's displayed with

00:32:10.379 --> 00:32:10.389
want to ensure that it's displayed with
 

00:32:10.389 --> 00:32:12.359
want to ensure that it's displayed with
the highest quality and of course that

00:32:12.359 --> 00:32:12.369
the highest quality and of course that
 

00:32:12.369 --> 00:32:14.190
the highest quality and of course that
metadata can be really useful for lots

00:32:14.190 --> 00:32:14.200
metadata can be really useful for lots
 

00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:16.499
metadata can be really useful for lots
of other things then then we really do

00:32:16.499 --> 00:32:16.509
of other things then then we really do
 

00:32:16.509 --> 00:32:18.029
of other things then then we really do
recommend this this compact language

00:32:18.029 --> 00:32:18.039
recommend this this compact language
 

00:32:18.039 --> 00:32:21.629
recommend this this compact language
detector and and that'll you pipe the

00:32:21.629 --> 00:32:21.639
detector and and that'll you pipe the
 

00:32:21.639 --> 00:32:24.060
detector and and that'll you pipe the
output of that intercept look to into

00:32:24.060 --> 00:32:24.070
output of that intercept look to into
 

00:32:24.070 --> 00:32:25.829
output of that intercept look to into
sent text locale and that really

00:32:25.829 --> 00:32:25.839
sent text locale and that really
 

00:32:25.839 --> 00:32:27.749
sent text locale and that really
improves the quality of your of your

00:32:27.749 --> 00:32:27.759
improves the quality of your of your
 

00:32:27.759 --> 00:32:32.159
improves the quality of your of your
display so that's that's kind of all of

00:32:32.159 --> 00:32:32.169
display so that's that's kind of all of
 

00:32:32.169 --> 00:32:34.289
display so that's that's kind of all of
the prepared topics that I had I want to

00:32:34.289 --> 00:32:34.299
the prepared topics that I had I want to
 

00:32:34.299 --> 00:32:36.899
the prepared topics that I had I want to
open it up to questions I'm happy to

00:32:36.899 --> 00:32:36.909
open it up to questions I'm happy to
 

00:32:36.909 --> 00:32:39.060
open it up to questions I'm happy to
answer any questions you have and please

00:32:39.060 --> 00:32:39.070
answer any questions you have and please
 

00:32:39.070 --> 00:32:53.990
answer any questions you have and please
wait for the mic to come to you

00:32:53.990 --> 00:32:54.000
 
 

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:57.890
 
well on the topic of custom fonts so you

00:32:57.890 --> 00:32:57.900
well on the topic of custom fonts so you
 

00:32:57.900 --> 00:33:00.560
well on the topic of custom fonts so you
can choose custom fonts via like on

00:33:00.560 --> 00:33:00.570
can choose custom fonts via like on
 

00:33:00.570 --> 00:33:02.540
can choose custom fonts via like on
simple view such as text view but it's

00:33:02.540 --> 00:33:02.550
simple view such as text view but it's
 

00:33:02.550 --> 00:33:05.630
simple view such as text view but it's
pretty difficult to do for framework UI

00:33:05.630 --> 00:33:05.640
pretty difficult to do for framework UI
 

00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:08.150
pretty difficult to do for framework UI
constellations like navigation view or

00:33:08.150 --> 00:33:08.160
constellations like navigation view or
 

00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:10.580
constellations like navigation view or
like toolbar is there a recommended way

00:33:10.580 --> 00:33:10.590
like toolbar is there a recommended way
 

00:33:10.590 --> 00:33:12.320
like toolbar is there a recommended way
by the frameworks team to achieve like

00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:12.330
by the frameworks team to achieve like
 

00:33:12.330 --> 00:33:14.290
by the frameworks team to achieve like
custom fonts globally within your app

00:33:14.290 --> 00:33:14.300
custom fonts globally within your app
 

00:33:14.300 --> 00:33:17.810
custom fonts globally within your app
yeah that's a good question I we there I

00:33:17.810 --> 00:33:17.820
yeah that's a good question I we there I
 

00:33:17.820 --> 00:33:23.450
yeah that's a good question I we there I
don't think we have a mechanism for like

00:33:23.450 --> 00:33:23.460
don't think we have a mechanism for like
 

00:33:23.460 --> 00:33:26.180
don't think we have a mechanism for like
applying a font you know globally across

00:33:26.180 --> 00:33:26.190
applying a font you know globally across
 

00:33:26.190 --> 00:33:28.520
applying a font you know globally across
the app so unfortunately I think that is

00:33:28.520 --> 00:33:28.530
the app so unfortunately I think that is
 

00:33:28.530 --> 00:33:29.840
the app so unfortunately I think that is
something that you have to do you know

00:33:29.840 --> 00:33:29.850
something that you have to do you know
 

00:33:29.850 --> 00:33:33.710
something that you have to do you know
with with code but but that's a that's

00:33:33.710 --> 00:33:33.720
with with code but but that's a that's
 

00:33:33.720 --> 00:33:35.900
with with code but but that's a that's
something you know that we're interested

00:33:35.900 --> 00:33:35.910
something you know that we're interested
 

00:33:35.910 --> 00:33:44.000
something you know that we're interested
in looking at making easier situations

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:44.010
in looking at making easier situations
 

00:33:44.010 --> 00:33:48.980
in looking at making easier situations
where they want to be exactly this size

00:33:48.980 --> 00:33:48.990
where they want to be exactly this size
 

00:33:48.990 --> 00:33:50.420
where they want to be exactly this size
possibly because it's aligning with an

00:33:50.420 --> 00:33:50.430
possibly because it's aligning with an
 

00:33:50.430 --> 00:33:53.060
possibly because it's aligning with an
image or something like that is there

00:33:53.060 --> 00:33:53.070
image or something like that is there
 

00:33:53.070 --> 00:33:55.310
image or something like that is there
what is your recommendation for what I

00:33:55.310 --> 00:33:55.320
what is your recommendation for what I
 

00:33:55.320 --> 00:33:56.660
what is your recommendation for what I
really like to do is have the text

00:33:56.660 --> 00:33:56.670
really like to do is have the text
 

00:33:56.670 --> 00:33:59.060
really like to do is have the text
shrink down if it's in a language that

00:33:59.060 --> 00:33:59.070
shrink down if it's in a language that
 

00:33:59.070 --> 00:34:01.670
shrink down if it's in a language that
has more text there yeah what is your

00:34:01.670 --> 00:34:01.680
has more text there yeah what is your
 

00:34:01.680 --> 00:34:04.100
has more text there yeah what is your
recommendation for that that's a very

00:34:04.100 --> 00:34:04.110
recommendation for that that's a very
 

00:34:04.110 --> 00:34:06.800
recommendation for that that's a very
common request and we do not have

00:34:06.800 --> 00:34:06.810
common request and we do not have
 

00:34:06.810 --> 00:34:09.500
common request and we do not have
support in the framework for that yet it

00:34:09.500 --> 00:34:09.510
support in the framework for that yet it
 

00:34:09.510 --> 00:34:11.180
support in the framework for that yet it
is something that we are really looking

00:34:11.180 --> 00:34:11.190
is something that we are really looking
 

00:34:11.190 --> 00:34:13.970
is something that we are really looking
at there are a number of open-source

00:34:13.970 --> 00:34:13.980
at there are a number of open-source
 

00:34:13.980 --> 00:34:15.620
at there are a number of open-source
libraries one of the reasons that we

00:34:15.620 --> 00:34:15.630
libraries one of the reasons that we
 

00:34:15.630 --> 00:34:17.990
libraries one of the reasons that we
haven't um implemented something like

00:34:17.990 --> 00:34:18.000
haven't um implemented something like
 

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:21.140
haven't um implemented something like
that we I looked at it and one of the

00:34:21.140 --> 00:34:21.150
that we I looked at it and one of the
 

00:34:21.150 --> 00:34:22.640
that we I looked at it and one of the
problems that you get into is that you

00:34:22.640 --> 00:34:22.650
problems that you get into is that you
 

00:34:22.650 --> 00:34:25.220
problems that you get into is that you
get kind of how do you specify what that

00:34:25.220 --> 00:34:25.230
get kind of how do you specify what that
 

00:34:25.230 --> 00:34:26.840
get kind of how do you specify what that
behavior should be so you just specify

00:34:26.840 --> 00:34:26.850
behavior should be so you just specify
 

00:34:26.850 --> 00:34:28.490
behavior should be so you just specify
kind of one point in there where you

00:34:28.490 --> 00:34:28.500
kind of one point in there where you
 

00:34:28.500 --> 00:34:30.860
kind of one point in there where you
want it to be exactly that size but

00:34:30.860 --> 00:34:30.870
want it to be exactly that size but
 

00:34:30.870 --> 00:34:32.900
want it to be exactly that size but
there's a lot of other use cases where

00:34:32.900 --> 00:34:32.910
there's a lot of other use cases where
 

00:34:32.910 --> 00:34:34.910
there's a lot of other use cases where
people are trying to you know because

00:34:34.910 --> 00:34:34.920
people are trying to you know because
 

00:34:34.920 --> 00:34:36.080
people are trying to you know because
you're trying to line it up basically

00:34:36.080 --> 00:34:36.090
you're trying to line it up basically
 

00:34:36.090 --> 00:34:37.730
you're trying to line it up basically
with other other graphic elements

00:34:37.730 --> 00:34:37.740
with other other graphic elements
 

00:34:37.740 --> 00:34:39.530
with other other graphic elements
there's a lot of other cases where

00:34:39.530 --> 00:34:39.540
there's a lot of other cases where
 

00:34:39.540 --> 00:34:40.850
there's a lot of other cases where
people are just mostly concerned about

00:34:40.850 --> 00:34:40.860
people are just mostly concerned about
 

00:34:40.860 --> 00:34:42.170
people are just mostly concerned about
making it fit so they want kind of

00:34:42.170 --> 00:34:42.180
making it fit so they want kind of
 

00:34:42.180 --> 00:34:43.790
making it fit so they want kind of
different logic they want something that

00:34:43.790 --> 00:34:43.800
different logic they want something that
 

00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:46.460
different logic they want something that
says make it a standard size make it 14

00:34:46.460 --> 00:34:46.470
says make it a standard size make it 14
 

00:34:46.470 --> 00:34:48.770
says make it a standard size make it 14
SP unless it doesn't fit and then we

00:34:48.770 --> 00:34:48.780
SP unless it doesn't fit and then we
 

00:34:48.780 --> 00:34:51.050
SP unless it doesn't fit and then we
excuse me and then we want to have it

00:34:51.050 --> 00:34:51.060
excuse me and then we want to have it
 

00:34:51.060 --> 00:34:53.270
excuse me and then we want to have it
shrink down to some other size but we

00:34:53.270 --> 00:34:53.280
shrink down to some other size but we
 

00:34:53.280 --> 00:34:54.680
shrink down to some other size but we
don't want to have it shrink bound to

00:34:54.680 --> 00:34:54.690
don't want to have it shrink bound to
 

00:34:54.690 --> 00:34:56.570
don't want to have it shrink bound to
you know below like eight because then

00:34:56.570 --> 00:34:56.580
you know below like eight because then
 

00:34:56.580 --> 00:34:58.580
you know below like eight because then
it becomes illegible so you get these

00:34:58.580 --> 00:34:58.590
it becomes illegible so you get these
 

00:34:58.590 --> 00:35:01.490
it becomes illegible so you get these
cases were like specifying how you want

00:35:01.490 --> 00:35:01.500
cases were like specifying how you want
 

00:35:01.500 --> 00:35:03.620
cases were like specifying how you want
that behavior to scale is kind of

00:35:03.620 --> 00:35:03.630
that behavior to scale is kind of
 

00:35:03.630 --> 00:35:05.840
that behavior to scale is kind of
complicated and that's that's kind of

00:35:05.840 --> 00:35:05.850
complicated and that's that's kind of
 

00:35:05.850 --> 00:35:06.660
complicated and that's that's kind of
you know

00:35:06.660 --> 00:35:06.670
you know
 

00:35:06.670 --> 00:35:09.000
you know
we when we if and when we do implement

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:09.010
we when we if and when we do implement
 

00:35:09.010 --> 00:35:10.260
we when we if and when we do implement
something like that in the framework we

00:35:10.260 --> 00:35:10.270
something like that in the framework we
 

00:35:10.270 --> 00:35:12.000
something like that in the framework we
really need to make sure that we get

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:12.010
really need to make sure that we get
 

00:35:12.010 --> 00:35:15.329
really need to make sure that we get
that we cover the range of behavior in a

00:35:15.329 --> 00:35:15.339
that we cover the range of behavior in a
 

00:35:15.339 --> 00:35:18.780
that we cover the range of behavior in a
way that makes sense until then you know

00:35:18.780 --> 00:35:18.790
way that makes sense until then you know
 

00:35:18.790 --> 00:35:20.849
way that makes sense until then you know
I'm not gonna recommend any specific

00:35:20.849 --> 00:35:20.859
I'm not gonna recommend any specific
 

00:35:20.859 --> 00:35:23.280
I'm not gonna recommend any specific
open source library but there's a bunch

00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:23.290
open source library but there's a bunch
 

00:35:23.290 --> 00:35:25.589
open source library but there's a bunch
of them out there and it's likely that

00:35:25.589 --> 00:35:25.599
of them out there and it's likely that
 

00:35:25.599 --> 00:35:28.079
of them out there and it's likely that
there's something that just subclasses

00:35:28.079 --> 00:35:28.089
there's something that just subclasses
 

00:35:28.089 --> 00:35:29.849
there's something that just subclasses
you know text view and and and overlays

00:35:29.849 --> 00:35:29.859
you know text view and and and overlays
 

00:35:29.859 --> 00:35:31.650
you know text view and and and overlays
that behavior that there's light it's

00:35:31.650 --> 00:35:31.660
that behavior that there's light it's
 

00:35:31.660 --> 00:35:32.970
that behavior that there's light it's
likely that there's something that will

00:35:32.970 --> 00:35:32.980
likely that there's something that will
 

00:35:32.980 --> 00:35:36.650
likely that there's something that will
fit what you need

00:35:36.650 --> 00:35:36.660
 
 

00:35:36.660 --> 00:35:39.990
 
early on I saw mention for CSS Styles

00:35:39.990 --> 00:35:40.000
early on I saw mention for CSS Styles
 

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:42.270
early on I saw mention for CSS Styles
being applied to text is that something

00:35:42.270 --> 00:35:42.280
being applied to text is that something
 

00:35:42.280 --> 00:35:43.859
being applied to text is that something
that's done through styles or is it you

00:35:43.859 --> 00:35:43.869
that's done through styles or is it you
 

00:35:43.869 --> 00:35:47.839
that's done through styles or is it you
through the use of HTML tags okay so I

00:35:47.839 --> 00:35:47.849
through the use of HTML tags okay so I
 

00:35:47.849 --> 00:35:50.700
through the use of HTML tags okay so I
thought was misleading that it's not CSS

00:35:50.700 --> 00:35:50.710
thought was misleading that it's not CSS
 

00:35:50.710 --> 00:35:53.160
thought was misleading that it's not CSS
styles in general that we're applying to

00:35:53.160 --> 00:35:53.170
styles in general that we're applying to
 

00:35:53.170 --> 00:35:56.460
styles in general that we're applying to
text that there are specific attributes

00:35:56.460 --> 00:35:56.470
text that there are specific attributes
 

00:35:56.470 --> 00:35:59.220
text that there are specific attributes
there's specific parameters and that

00:35:59.220 --> 00:35:59.230
there's specific parameters and that
 

00:35:59.230 --> 00:36:01.650
there's specific parameters and that
were in that particular slide I was

00:36:01.650 --> 00:36:01.660
were in that particular slide I was
 

00:36:01.660 --> 00:36:03.420
were in that particular slide I was
talking about font feature settings and

00:36:03.420 --> 00:36:03.430
talking about font feature settings and
 

00:36:03.430 --> 00:36:06.180
talking about font feature settings and
it's like the syntax because you know

00:36:06.180 --> 00:36:06.190
it's like the syntax because you know
 

00:36:06.190 --> 00:36:07.349
it's like the syntax because you know
specifying all these open type features

00:36:07.349 --> 00:36:07.359
specifying all these open type features
 

00:36:07.359 --> 00:36:09.599
specifying all these open type features
is kind of a complex thing it's not just

00:36:09.599 --> 00:36:09.609
is kind of a complex thing it's not just
 

00:36:09.609 --> 00:36:11.490
is kind of a complex thing it's not just
like a number or something like that and

00:36:11.490 --> 00:36:11.500
like a number or something like that and
 

00:36:11.500 --> 00:36:15.329
like a number or something like that and
so we adapted the syntax from CSS it is

00:36:15.329 --> 00:36:15.339
so we adapted the syntax from CSS it is
 

00:36:15.339 --> 00:36:18.000
so we adapted the syntax from CSS it is
compatible with CSS so if you have that

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:18.010
compatible with CSS so if you have that
 

00:36:18.010 --> 00:36:19.980
compatible with CSS so if you have that
particular feature other features that

00:36:19.980 --> 00:36:19.990
particular feature other features that
 

00:36:19.990 --> 00:36:22.500
particular feature other features that
we've got like letter spacing the name

00:36:22.500 --> 00:36:22.510
we've got like letter spacing the name
 

00:36:22.510 --> 00:36:24.510
we've got like letter spacing the name
of the future the meaning of the feature

00:36:24.510 --> 00:36:24.520
of the future the meaning of the feature
 

00:36:24.520 --> 00:36:26.400
of the future the meaning of the feature
we're trying to make it consistent with

00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:26.410
we're trying to make it consistent with
 

00:36:26.410 --> 00:36:29.280
we're trying to make it consistent with
CSS but we haven't like implemented a

00:36:29.280 --> 00:36:29.290
CSS but we haven't like implemented a
 

00:36:29.290 --> 00:36:31.920
CSS but we haven't like implemented a
web browser in android framework you

00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:31.930
web browser in android framework you
 

00:36:31.930 --> 00:36:34.319
web browser in android framework you
know text you can use webview but that's

00:36:34.319 --> 00:36:34.329
know text you can use webview but that's
 

00:36:34.329 --> 00:36:36.630
know text you can use webview but that's
you know there's there is not like a

00:36:36.630 --> 00:36:36.640
you know there's there is not like a
 

00:36:36.640 --> 00:36:39.720
you know there's there is not like a
generic CSS translator it's just these

00:36:39.720 --> 00:36:39.730
generic CSS translator it's just these
 

00:36:39.730 --> 00:36:43.770
generic CSS translator it's just these
specific features that are low impedance

00:36:43.770 --> 00:36:43.780
specific features that are low impedance
 

00:36:43.780 --> 00:36:50.940
specific features that are low impedance
or compatible with CSS what is the

00:36:50.940 --> 00:36:50.950
or compatible with CSS what is the
 

00:36:50.950 --> 00:36:52.950
or compatible with CSS what is the
performance cost of the high-quality

00:36:52.950 --> 00:36:52.960
performance cost of the high-quality
 

00:36:52.960 --> 00:36:55.200
performance cost of the high-quality
text layout strategy with hyphenation

00:36:55.200 --> 00:36:55.210
text layout strategy with hyphenation
 

00:36:55.210 --> 00:36:57.089
text layout strategy with hyphenation
for example if you like to want to

00:36:57.089 --> 00:36:57.099
for example if you like to want to
 

00:36:57.099 --> 00:36:58.559
for example if you like to want to
actually change the text view contents

00:36:58.559 --> 00:36:58.569
actually change the text view contents
 

00:36:58.569 --> 00:37:02.309
actually change the text view contents
so what is that gonna cost you well you

00:37:02.309 --> 00:37:02.319
so what is that gonna cost you well you
 

00:37:02.319 --> 00:37:04.829
so what is that gonna cost you well you
you you know measuring text performance

00:37:04.829 --> 00:37:04.839
you you know measuring text performance
 

00:37:04.839 --> 00:37:09.329
you you know measuring text performance
is really complex I mean the the order

00:37:09.329 --> 00:37:09.339
is really complex I mean the the order
 

00:37:09.339 --> 00:37:12.870
is really complex I mean the the order
of magnitude is that it's about the same

00:37:12.870 --> 00:37:12.880
of magnitude is that it's about the same
 

00:37:12.880 --> 00:37:17.520
of magnitude is that it's about the same
as simple text in lollipop so you know

00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:17.530
as simple text in lollipop so you know
 

00:37:17.530 --> 00:37:19.960
as simple text in lollipop so you know
it's doing more work but we actual

00:37:19.960 --> 00:37:19.970
it's doing more work but we actual
 

00:37:19.970 --> 00:37:21.630
it's doing more work but we actual
took a wrench to it and did a lot of

00:37:21.630 --> 00:37:21.640
took a wrench to it and did a lot of
 

00:37:21.640 --> 00:37:23.770
took a wrench to it and did a lot of
optimizations to make it go faster

00:37:23.770 --> 00:37:23.780
optimizations to make it go faster
 

00:37:23.780 --> 00:37:25.720
optimizations to make it go faster
there's gonna be some specific cases

00:37:25.720 --> 00:37:25.730
there's gonna be some specific cases
 

00:37:25.730 --> 00:37:27.070
there's gonna be some specific cases
that are gonna be a little slower

00:37:27.070 --> 00:37:27.080
that are gonna be a little slower
 

00:37:27.080 --> 00:37:29.109
that are gonna be a little slower
there's other cases like for if you're

00:37:29.109 --> 00:37:29.119
there's other cases like for if you're
 

00:37:29.119 --> 00:37:31.089
there's other cases like for if you're
editing a very large buffer that it's

00:37:31.089 --> 00:37:31.099
editing a very large buffer that it's
 

00:37:31.099 --> 00:37:33.250
editing a very large buffer that it's
gonna be a lot faster because we really

00:37:33.250 --> 00:37:33.260
gonna be a lot faster because we really
 

00:37:33.260 --> 00:37:35.349
gonna be a lot faster because we really
did a lot of them performance

00:37:35.349 --> 00:37:35.359
did a lot of them performance
 

00:37:35.359 --> 00:37:38.710
did a lot of them performance
improvement in that area so ultimately

00:37:38.710 --> 00:37:38.720
improvement in that area so ultimately
 

00:37:38.720 --> 00:37:40.060
improvement in that area so ultimately
if you're really concerned about

00:37:40.060 --> 00:37:40.070
if you're really concerned about
 

00:37:40.070 --> 00:37:41.560
if you're really concerned about
performance like if you've got if you've

00:37:41.560 --> 00:37:41.570
performance like if you've got if you've
 

00:37:41.570 --> 00:37:43.390
performance like if you've got if you've
profiled your app and you've said oh my

00:37:43.390 --> 00:37:43.400
profiled your app and you've said oh my
 

00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:45.700
profiled your app and you've said oh my
god I'm spending all of this time doing

00:37:45.700 --> 00:37:45.710
god I'm spending all of this time doing
 

00:37:45.710 --> 00:37:47.349
god I'm spending all of this time doing
the layout of the high quality layout

00:37:47.349 --> 00:37:47.359
the layout of the high quality layout
 

00:37:47.359 --> 00:37:50.589
the layout of the high quality layout
and if you've decided that the visual

00:37:50.589 --> 00:37:50.599
and if you've decided that the visual
 

00:37:50.599 --> 00:37:52.180
and if you've decided that the visual
improvement of that is not worth it in

00:37:52.180 --> 00:37:52.190
improvement of that is not worth it in
 

00:37:52.190 --> 00:37:54.070
improvement of that is not worth it in
your app then by all means that simple

00:37:54.070 --> 00:37:54.080
your app then by all means that simple
 

00:37:54.080 --> 00:37:57.370
your app then by all means that simple
we have not come across I can't really

00:37:57.370 --> 00:37:57.380
we have not come across I can't really
 

00:37:57.380 --> 00:37:59.859
we have not come across I can't really
think of any apps that I know of either

00:37:59.859 --> 00:37:59.869
think of any apps that I know of either
 

00:37:59.869 --> 00:38:01.630
think of any apps that I know of either
first party or third party where people

00:38:01.630 --> 00:38:01.640
first party or third party where people
 

00:38:01.640 --> 00:38:03.339
first party or third party where people
have felt a need to do that but it's

00:38:03.339 --> 00:38:03.349
have felt a need to do that but it's
 

00:38:03.349 --> 00:38:06.310
have felt a need to do that but it's
certainly an option and we will continue

00:38:06.310 --> 00:38:06.320
certainly an option and we will continue
 

00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:08.170
certainly an option and we will continue
to improve the performance there's you

00:38:08.170 --> 00:38:08.180
to improve the performance there's you
 

00:38:08.180 --> 00:38:10.690
to improve the performance there's you
know it's this is a very important area

00:38:10.690 --> 00:38:10.700
know it's this is a very important area
 

00:38:10.700 --> 00:38:17.230
know it's this is a very important area
for us it's got to not jank no

00:38:17.230 --> 00:38:17.240
for us it's got to not jank no
 

00:38:17.240 --> 00:38:19.000
for us it's got to not jank no
unfortunately a lot of the stuff that

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:19.010
unfortunately a lot of the stuff that
 

00:38:19.010 --> 00:38:20.800
unfortunately a lot of the stuff that
happens in framework text is at such a

00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:20.810
happens in framework text is at such a
 

00:38:20.810 --> 00:38:23.380
happens in framework text is at such a
low level that you can't really fill it

00:38:23.380 --> 00:38:23.390
low level that you can't really fill it
 

00:38:23.390 --> 00:38:34.710
low level that you can't really fill it
in with a support library

00:38:34.710 --> 00:38:34.720
 
 

00:38:34.720 --> 00:38:37.109
 
hi I know better than ask you what are

00:38:37.109 --> 00:38:37.119
hi I know better than ask you what are
 

00:38:37.119 --> 00:38:38.070
hi I know better than ask you what are
you guys are going to do in the future

00:38:38.070 --> 00:38:38.080
you guys are going to do in the future
 

00:38:38.080 --> 00:38:41.450
you guys are going to do in the future
but I wanted to ask a little about I'm

00:38:41.450 --> 00:38:41.460
but I wanted to ask a little about I'm
 

00:38:41.460 --> 00:38:44.700
but I wanted to ask a little about I'm
static layout and the new method that

00:38:44.700 --> 00:38:44.710
static layout and the new method that
 

00:38:44.710 --> 00:38:48.660
static layout and the new method that
lets you set custom margins per line yes

00:38:48.660 --> 00:38:48.670
lets you set custom margins per line yes
 

00:38:48.670 --> 00:38:51.270
lets you set custom margins per line yes
I know it's not ready to do full

00:38:51.270 --> 00:38:51.280
I know it's not ready to do full
 

00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:53.010
I know it's not ready to do full
wrapping around a path which is what I

00:38:53.010 --> 00:38:53.020
wrapping around a path which is what I
 

00:38:53.020 --> 00:38:54.599
wrapping around a path which is what I
imagined when I first heard about it but

00:38:54.599 --> 00:38:54.609
imagined when I first heard about it but
 

00:38:54.609 --> 00:38:56.580
imagined when I first heard about it but
I am wondering what what were you guys

00:38:56.580 --> 00:38:56.590
I am wondering what what were you guys
 

00:38:56.590 --> 00:38:58.890
I am wondering what what were you guys
imagining when you out of it is it just

00:38:58.890 --> 00:38:58.900
imagining when you out of it is it just
 

00:38:58.900 --> 00:39:00.630
imagining when you out of it is it just
the circular watch space or is there

00:39:00.630 --> 00:39:00.640
the circular watch space or is there
 

00:39:00.640 --> 00:39:04.500
the circular watch space or is there
something else cool oh great no and like

00:39:04.500 --> 00:39:04.510
something else cool oh great no and like
 

00:39:04.510 --> 00:39:06.810
something else cool oh great no and like
that's a slide that almost happened in

00:39:06.810 --> 00:39:06.820
that's a slide that almost happened in
 

00:39:06.820 --> 00:39:08.280
that's a slide that almost happened in
this talk and I wanted to keep it simple

00:39:08.280 --> 00:39:08.290
this talk and I wanted to keep it simple
 

00:39:08.290 --> 00:39:10.349
this talk and I wanted to keep it simple
because I wanted to you know talk about

00:39:10.349 --> 00:39:10.359
because I wanted to you know talk about
 

00:39:10.359 --> 00:39:14.400
because I wanted to you know talk about
things that you know would would be for

00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:14.410
things that you know would would be for
 

00:39:14.410 --> 00:39:16.170
things that you know would would be for
most developers so certainly the

00:39:16.170 --> 00:39:16.180
most developers so certainly the
 

00:39:16.180 --> 00:39:18.359
most developers so certainly the
circular watch face so just so maybe I

00:39:18.359 --> 00:39:18.369
circular watch face so just so maybe I
 

00:39:18.369 --> 00:39:20.599
circular watch face so just so maybe I
should just explain that that there's

00:39:20.599 --> 00:39:20.609
should just explain that that there's
 

00:39:20.609 --> 00:39:24.420
should just explain that that there's
layers in of the text stack where text

00:39:24.420 --> 00:39:24.430
layers in of the text stack where text
 

00:39:24.430 --> 00:39:25.830
layers in of the text stack where text
view is the one that most of you

00:39:25.830 --> 00:39:25.840
view is the one that most of you
 

00:39:25.840 --> 00:39:28.859
view is the one that most of you
interact with but underneath text view

00:39:28.859 --> 00:39:28.869
interact with but underneath text view
 

00:39:28.869 --> 00:39:31.830
interact with but underneath text view
is static layout and static layout does

00:39:31.830 --> 00:39:31.840
is static layout and static layout does
 

00:39:31.840 --> 00:39:34.140
is static layout and static layout does
a lot of the things around line breaking

00:39:34.140 --> 00:39:34.150
a lot of the things around line breaking
 

00:39:34.150 --> 00:39:36.180
a lot of the things around line breaking
and paragraph layout and then below that

00:39:36.180 --> 00:39:36.190
and paragraph layout and then below that
 

00:39:36.190 --> 00:39:38.130
and paragraph layout and then below that
is like draw text in the kind of very

00:39:38.130 --> 00:39:38.140
is like draw text in the kind of very
 

00:39:38.140 --> 00:39:40.620
is like draw text in the kind of very
low-level api's and instead of a out we

00:39:40.620 --> 00:39:40.630
low-level api's and instead of a out we
 

00:39:40.630 --> 00:39:42.660
low-level api's and instead of a out we
have a new method that lets you kind of

00:39:42.660 --> 00:39:42.670
have a new method that lets you kind of
 

00:39:42.670 --> 00:39:45.120
have a new method that lets you kind of
address the shape by controlling indents

00:39:45.120 --> 00:39:45.130
address the shape by controlling indents
 

00:39:45.130 --> 00:39:47.910
address the shape by controlling indents
on the paragraph and so yes the watch

00:39:47.910 --> 00:39:47.920
on the paragraph and so yes the watch
 

00:39:47.920 --> 00:39:49.950
on the paragraph and so yes the watch
face was absolutely a motivation for

00:39:49.950 --> 00:39:49.960
face was absolutely a motivation for
 

00:39:49.960 --> 00:39:52.470
face was absolutely a motivation for
that we are seeing other applications

00:39:52.470 --> 00:39:52.480
that we are seeing other applications
 

00:39:52.480 --> 00:39:54.540
that we are seeing other applications
people are adopting it in cases where

00:39:54.540 --> 00:39:54.550
people are adopting it in cases where
 

00:39:54.550 --> 00:39:57.750
people are adopting it in cases where
people are you know doing custom views

00:39:57.750 --> 00:39:57.760
people are you know doing custom views
 

00:39:57.760 --> 00:39:59.339
people are you know doing custom views
rather than just relying on text view

00:39:59.339 --> 00:39:59.349
rather than just relying on text view
 

00:39:59.349 --> 00:40:01.440
rather than just relying on text view
one of the really nice ones is when you

00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:01.450
one of the really nice ones is when you
 

00:40:01.450 --> 00:40:03.120
one of the really nice ones is when you
just get to flow around an image where

00:40:03.120 --> 00:40:03.130
just get to flow around an image where
 

00:40:03.130 --> 00:40:04.440
just get to flow around an image where
you're basically doing something like a

00:40:04.440 --> 00:40:04.450
you're basically doing something like a
 

00:40:04.450 --> 00:40:09.660
you're basically doing something like a
you know like a web style float and you

00:40:09.660 --> 00:40:09.670
you know like a web style float and you
 

00:40:09.670 --> 00:40:12.450
you know like a web style float and you
know it is possible to do your own to

00:40:12.450 --> 00:40:12.460
know it is possible to do your own to
 

00:40:12.460 --> 00:40:14.130
know it is possible to do your own to
kind of roll your own if you've got a

00:40:14.130 --> 00:40:14.140
kind of roll your own if you've got a
 

00:40:14.140 --> 00:40:17.190
kind of roll your own if you've got a
path you know to figure out based on the

00:40:17.190 --> 00:40:17.200
path you know to figure out based on the
 

00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:18.960
path you know to figure out based on the
knowledge of the line Heights and stuff

00:40:18.960 --> 00:40:18.970
knowledge of the line Heights and stuff
 

00:40:18.970 --> 00:40:20.220
knowledge of the line Heights and stuff
like that to figure out what the indents

00:40:20.220 --> 00:40:20.230
like that to figure out what the indents
 

00:40:20.230 --> 00:40:22.800
like that to figure out what the indents
are I think you will you'll see this

00:40:22.800 --> 00:40:22.810
are I think you will you'll see this
 

00:40:22.810 --> 00:40:26.339
are I think you will you'll see this
continue to evolve you know clearly

00:40:26.339 --> 00:40:26.349
continue to evolve you know clearly
 

00:40:26.349 --> 00:40:30.000
continue to evolve you know clearly
there's you know it makes sense to do a

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:30.010
there's you know it makes sense to do a
 

00:40:30.010 --> 00:40:31.650
there's you know it makes sense to do a
higher level feature that has you know

00:40:31.650 --> 00:40:31.660
higher level feature that has you know
 

00:40:31.660 --> 00:40:33.839
higher level feature that has you know
kind of easier to use it's not it's not

00:40:33.839 --> 00:40:33.849
kind of easier to use it's not it's not
 

00:40:33.849 --> 00:40:36.329
kind of easier to use it's not it's not
so low level but unfortunately it is not

00:40:36.329 --> 00:40:36.339
so low level but unfortunately it is not
 

00:40:36.339 --> 00:40:41.080
so low level but unfortunately it is not
there yet

00:40:41.080 --> 00:40:41.090
 
 

00:40:41.090 --> 00:40:45.310
 
any other questions all right well thank

00:40:45.310 --> 00:40:45.320
any other questions all right well thank
 

00:40:45.320 --> 00:40:48.280
