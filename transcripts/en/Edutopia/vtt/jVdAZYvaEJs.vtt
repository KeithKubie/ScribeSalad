00:00:09.586 --> 00:00:12.616
&gt;&gt;Steven: Elk Grove Unified School
District is the fifth largest school

00:00:12.616 --> 00:00:14.256
district in the state of California.

00:00:14.916 --> 00:00:17.926
We serve approximately
62,000 students.

00:00:18.436 --> 00:00:22.336
We cover 320 square
miles, which is one-third

00:00:22.336 --> 00:00:24.406
of the entire county of Sacramento.

00:00:25.266 --> 00:00:27.826
We have a very richly
diverse population,

00:00:27.826 --> 00:00:31.366
with over 80 languages being
spoken inside the district.

00:00:31.926 --> 00:00:34.396
When I first started my
career, I was a shop teacher,

00:00:34.576 --> 00:00:38.786
and so one of the things that I
will share is that when we talk

00:00:38.786 --> 00:00:44.406
about career technical education in
the 21st century, those woodshops

00:00:44.406 --> 00:00:48.836
of the past is not what career
technical education is about today.

00:00:48.996 --> 00:00:51.756
For the 21st century,
we have young people

00:00:51.756 --> 00:00:55.596
in the Elk Grove Unified School
District that are harvesting algae

00:00:56.046 --> 00:00:59.196
so that they can press
out of the algae oils

00:00:59.546 --> 00:01:01.776
so that they can make biofuels.

00:01:01.776 --> 00:01:05.056
And we're seeing teachers
at a variety of our schools

00:01:05.056 --> 00:01:09.486
that are getting students not only
engaged in the academic rigors

00:01:09.856 --> 00:01:12.936
of a multiple-pathway career
technical education program

00:01:13.386 --> 00:01:15.046
but are getting them engaged in ways

00:01:15.046 --> 00:01:18.206
that their academics
are very rigorous,

00:01:18.536 --> 00:01:20.136
that they're taking the kinds

00:01:20.136 --> 00:01:22.816
of higher mathematics
that you want to see.

00:01:22.816 --> 00:01:26.436
And so I would suggest that
it's green academy, animation,

00:01:26.516 --> 00:01:30.726
agriculture that is allowing our
students to be very productive,

00:01:31.136 --> 00:01:36.076
both academically and being well
prepared to go into higher education

00:01:36.546 --> 00:01:39.326
and then go into the workforce
because the skill sets

00:01:39.326 --> 00:01:42.136
that they're getting
really are 21st century.

00:01:42.316 --> 00:01:43.666
We are seeing our students

00:01:43.666 --> 00:01:46.246
with higher attendance
rates in our academies.

00:01:46.526 --> 00:01:49.296
There is a very, very
high success rate

00:01:49.296 --> 00:01:50.996
of students not only
completing the program

00:01:50.996 --> 00:01:52.496
but going on to higher education.

00:01:53.206 --> 00:01:55.776
We're seeing students
that are highly motivated,

00:01:55.776 --> 00:01:57.786
and there are several
reasons for these things--

00:01:58.636 --> 00:02:00.726
obviously, the connection
with the instructors,

00:02:00.726 --> 00:02:04.856
connection with the family, kind of
a feel inside the academy programs,

00:02:05.266 --> 00:02:09.166
the peer support for one another,
so we're seeing all of those.

00:02:09.566 --> 00:02:11.846
Now, we're also watching our
young people do very well

00:02:11.846 --> 00:02:13.506
on the California High
School Exit Exam.

00:02:13.976 --> 00:02:16.076
We are seeing success
in the programs.

00:02:16.076 --> 00:02:17.816
We are seeing success in graduation.

00:02:18.166 --> 00:02:19.636
We're seeing success in kids going

00:02:19.706 --> 00:02:22.076
on into higher education
and the world of work.

00:02:22.076 --> 00:02:23.506
&gt;&gt;Instructor: Again, and just
a little more theatricality.

00:02:24.046 --> 00:02:26.656
&gt;&gt;Steven: Our academies
are not exclusive.

00:02:27.176 --> 00:02:28.536
They are inclusive.

00:02:28.606 --> 00:02:33.226
California Partnership Academies
ask for at least 40% of the students

00:02:33.226 --> 00:02:37.286
to come into the program that
would be, in some people's eyes,

00:02:37.286 --> 00:02:39.426
considered at-risk students.

00:02:39.786 --> 00:02:40.996
Now, our doors are open.

00:02:41.816 --> 00:02:44.546
We want to see, as does the
California Partnership Academy,

00:02:44.546 --> 00:02:48.876
that there is dedicated staff that
work with a collection of students

00:02:49.206 --> 00:02:52.806
on an integrated fashion to ensure
that the delivery of the work,

00:02:52.806 --> 00:02:55.576
all the way from the
keystone class all the way

00:02:55.576 --> 00:02:59.306
through the academic rigor coming
through the program, is integrated,

00:02:59.566 --> 00:03:02.196
that is focused, that
there is clear evidence

00:03:02.196 --> 00:03:04.866
of where those relationships emerge.

00:03:04.866 --> 00:03:07.706
And if you have a particular--
let's take culinary arts.

00:03:07.706 --> 00:03:10.046
So that in the science
aspect of culinary arts,

00:03:10.456 --> 00:03:14.676
we want to see the science that
really is not only good science

00:03:14.676 --> 00:03:18.366
but how does it relate to culinary
production or food production.

00:03:18.456 --> 00:03:22.866
We were one of the first districts
in the state of California actually

00:03:22.866 --> 00:03:29.066
to use a modified national rubric to
certify academies, and quite frankly,

00:03:29.066 --> 00:03:31.826
we wanted to make sure that if
you said you were an academy,

00:03:32.126 --> 00:03:35.206
that the criteria that
we wanted to see in place

00:03:35.206 --> 00:03:38.016
as the Elk Grove Unified School
District and that the gold seal

00:03:38.086 --> 00:03:41.956
that you would get would be
reflective of a true academy

00:03:41.956 --> 00:03:43.906
and that we didn't want
to be confused about that.

00:03:43.906 --> 00:03:48.936
We didn't want to have a collection
of electives be categorized

00:03:48.936 --> 00:03:50.806
as an academy, so we
put that in place.

00:03:51.146 --> 00:03:55.206
&gt;&gt;Teacher: This is a closed-loop
photo bioreactor, and it's designed

00:03:55.206 --> 00:03:56.366
to be able to grow algae.

00:03:56.606 --> 00:04:00.696
And what we want to do then is to be
able to take that algae and turn it

00:04:00.696 --> 00:04:01.946
into products like fuel or...

00:04:01.946 --> 00:04:05.496
Stephen: Part of the Academy and
certification is tremendous outreach,

00:04:05.896 --> 00:04:10.196
and that is a valuable,
necessary ingredient to academies

00:04:10.326 --> 00:04:14.566
and the pathways to have business
partnerships that are there not just

00:04:14.616 --> 00:04:17.826
for money, because money is
certainly helpful and important,

00:04:18.316 --> 00:04:23.306
but it's that technical view
of what is your trade looking

00:04:23.306 --> 00:04:26.426
for in young people going into
college and then into work

00:04:26.426 --> 00:04:28.416
or going directly into the workforce.

00:04:28.416 --> 00:04:30.766
What we need to do is
quit talking about this

00:04:30.766 --> 00:04:34.456
as being an either or,
college or careers.

00:04:34.866 --> 00:04:38.686
This is about making sure that the
young people of today in California

00:04:38.686 --> 00:04:42.716
and across the country are prepared
to go on to higher education,

00:04:43.446 --> 00:04:47.596
go into the world of work and be
successful, and be contributors

00:04:47.596 --> 00:04:52.196
in a global economy, that our
students have a quality of life

00:04:52.696 --> 00:04:56.946
that anchors them to
be productive citizens.

00:04:57.046 --> 00:04:58.706
