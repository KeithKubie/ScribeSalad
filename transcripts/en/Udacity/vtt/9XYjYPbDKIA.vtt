00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:02.560
So I'm Sascha Ellers, and I'm the Director

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:05.670
of Clinical Operations. I'm from San Francisco, California.

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.250
&gt;&gt; All right. And what does a director of clinical operations do, exactly?

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:13.800
&gt;&gt; So I work with physicians and researchers to run

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:18.810
clinical trials. I take the ideas that the clinical staff, the,

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.470
the physicians have with a protocol and I work to implement

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.170
that protocol. So I will go out to key opinion leaders,

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:29.520
which are most likely physicians try to recruit them

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:33.690
to participate in the study. I will work with

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.880
data that comes out of the study so data

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.726
that's from the patients that enrol in the study.

00:00:38.726 --> 00:00:41.750
I do monitoring which is basically verifying that the

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.070
data that's recorded for our study is accurate and

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:47.680
matches what the data looks like in the patient's

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.460
medical records. and then you know all of the,

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:55.135
all of the work that it takes to oversee the study it's

00:00:55.135 --> 00:01:01.140
a regulated environment. So it's regulated by the FDA or, if, if, in

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.800
some cases research isn't regulated by the FDA but it's always regulated by

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.900
good clinical practice and international guidelines

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:09.970
on how to take care of patients.

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:11.690
&gt;&gt; So you have to actually be informed of a

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:14.240
lot of different things to be able to carry this out.

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:15.120
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:16.680
&gt;&gt; Now for those people

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.450
who may be slightly unfamiliar with how clinical trial works, or even what

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.960
one is, can you tell us just briefly the significance of a clinical trial?

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.700
&gt;&gt; Sure. So, any time you want to test an intervention, be it a drug,

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.320
a diagnostic test, or even just changes

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.730
in behavior, you want to show that there's

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:34.180
actually a difference, you want to run a

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:36.460
clinical trial. Because that's going to give you

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.030
the gold standard. to show you that

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.870
there's a difference with your drug or intervention.

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:48.836
So the, the clinical trial itself is a way to ask your question prospectively

00:01:48.836 --> 00:01:54.230
design your, your experiment in humans and then implement that study.

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:57.840
&gt;&gt; So this is sort of like the, okay prove that it works kind of thing.

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:58.720
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:02.450
&gt;&gt; And this process you said itself is regulated by the government?

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.226
&gt;&gt; By the FDA correct.

00:02:04.226 --> 00:02:09.020
&gt;&gt; By the FDA. and must you pass a clinical trial to

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:12.670
carry out your test or your diagnostic or whatever you want to

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.776
do, is that part of the requirement of ever selling your product?

00:02:15.776 --> 00:02:21.950
&gt;&gt; It, it, it depends. so to, to back up there're, there're three phases

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:24.250
of clinical trial development for a drug.

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.170
There's phase one where you're looking for your

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:30.420
safety. So you gotta prove that you're not going to do undue harm to people with

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:31.900
your drug. And then in phase two,

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.320
you're further refining your safety and you're starting

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:35.370
to look at efficacy.

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.803
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:02:35.803 --> 00:02:37.350
&gt;&gt; And then phase three are your large

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:39.390
efficacy trials where you're treating a lot of

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.150
patients with the drug at that point. so

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.440
that's kind of the basic methodology but then, within

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:50.990
that context, yeah, there is, it is regulated by the FDA. They do have a say in

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:52.935
what they're going to accept from the phase

00:02:52.935 --> 00:02:55.660
three trials as something they are willing to approve.

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:56.260
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:57.610
&gt;&gt; And so, a lot of effort goes

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:59.420
into pu, putting together a study that's going to

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:00.910
meet their requirements.

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:03.050
&gt;&gt; Sounds like it takes a lot of time to do this.

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.250
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.900
&gt;&gt; so it's sort of a big commitment from anybody interested.

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.440
&gt;&gt; Big commitment for companies, a lot of resources go into these

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:14.390
trials. In academic settings a lot of resources will go into these, these

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:18.970
studies as well. A, a recent example that's been approved is a drug called

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:25.600
Zelboraf. That looks at mutation in the melanoma cancer, called V600E. So

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.950
it looks at this mutation and says if the patient is

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:30.790
positive for this mutation, that if the cancer is positive for

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:33.810
this mutation, this would be a good drug for the patient

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:36.210
to try. And if they don't have the mutation, they're probably

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:38.690
not going to respond to the drug at all. So this is

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:43.260
a great example of using genetics in in a clinical study

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.290
to select patients. But you can also use the genetic information

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:50.980
to stratify patients if you want to compare patients with the marker

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:55.530
to those without. So it would just be a marker that would be used to look at how

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:58.210
you could break apart those two groups to look

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:01.070
at who did better or, or not in that case.

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:04.330
&gt;&gt; Right, and you said, so that's an example of something

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:06.790
that sort of went through this process and has been approved?

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:11.340
&gt;&gt; Yes. Part of the problem with, with clinical studies is that

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.490
you're, you're confined to the population

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:16.010
that you're testing them in. So sometimes

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:18.540
we'll see a signal where we look at the entire data set.

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:20.810
There'll be a signal in a subset of patients, but you don't

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:23.200
really know why you've wasted a lot of money on a negative

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:27.290
trial. One of the opportunities that genetics provides, is to help us

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:30.110
get the right patient on the right trial so that it increases

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:33.480
the likelihood that we're going to have a positive outcome for the trial.

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:38.140
And decreases the risk to the patients, or subjects, of being exposed

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:41.120
to treatments that aren't going to help them. So I think that that's

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:45.276
one of the most exciting things about the future of, of personalized genetics.

00:04:45.276 --> 00:04:45.834
&gt;&gt; Mm-hmm.

00:04:45.834 --> 00:04:48.190
&gt;&gt; In looking at developing drugs and treatments.

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:52.610
&gt;&gt; Tell us a bit more about your background. How did you get to be a director

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:54.760
of clinical operations? What did you study in

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:57.030
school? What did you do before you got here?

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:59.360
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so I have a bachelor's degree

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.560
in Biology. When I finished school, I didn't

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:07.040
really know what I wanted to do. I felt really lucky that I found this this

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:09.690
world of clinical studies so I, I, started

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:13.170
out in the CRO, Contract Research Organization. So

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:17.320
these are companies that serve pharma companies, by

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:19.849
helping to run the clinical trials, this is outsourced.

00:05:19.849 --> 00:05:20.340
&gt;&gt; Mm-hmm.

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:25.300
&gt;&gt; To that group, and so I I had my first job in, in a company like that and

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:29.540
from there came into biotech and pharma and diagnostics. And

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:32.630
I found it to just be a lot of fun.

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:38.270
I like to solve problems, right? So it's a great place to apply that.

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:41.620
&gt;&gt; So it sounds like you really get to in, in your job, you really

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:47.060
get to sort of be exposed to a lot of ideas and subjects that deal

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:51.900
with genetics. But you also really get the sort of, I guess I like the,

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:54.760
the verb, wallow, in the, the ethics, too.

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:58.590
And really have to be concerned about procedure,

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:01.970
you have to pay attention to detail, you've got to sort of know

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:06.310
technically what's going on. But you've also got to be able to remember

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:08.930
where you are, and what you're doing with regards to okay, this is

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:11.480
a human study, and these are all the things we have to go through.

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:12.600
&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:16.300
&gt;&gt; in general, how would you describe, how difficult is

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:19.130
this job, do you think, compared to other jobs, er?

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:23.700
&gt;&gt; It's difficult, probably, in a different way than somebody who's actually

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:26.970
crunching the data. We have to think through problems

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:29.920
like sometimes we'll have a study that it's, it's well

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:32.820
designed, it, it could yield great data. But we just

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:36.400
can't find the right subjects that want to join the study,

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:39.180
so then a lot of effort goes into recruitment planning

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:43.160
for the study. I've never worked on two studies that

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:46.980
have the same problems, they're always different. So and then,

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:48.770
you know, it builds on it itself. So you learn,

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:53.306
okay we gotta have recruitment plans in place before we start the study.

00:06:53.306 --> 00:06:57.710
We've, we've got to think through how we're going to ensure quality data before

00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:01.510
we start the study. All of these things that kind of become part of

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:03.560
the methodology, but yeah, every study has

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:06.810
its own issues and the landscape changes.

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:07.483
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:07:07.483 --> 00:07:09.290
&gt;&gt; Early in my career I worked on a drug called

00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:13.795
Sutent. I've worked on a phase one study of Sutent in gastrointestinal

00:07:13.795 --> 00:07:17.930
stromal tumors. and so when I saw that it was approved, i

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:21.415
thought that was really exciting, I also worked on a drug called Pertuzumab.

00:07:21.415 --> 00:07:22.060
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:24.720
&gt;&gt; it's called Perjeta and it's approved

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:27.640
for metastatic breast cancer, so that's been exciting.

00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:32.180
&gt;&gt; If you, if somebody's watching you right now and they're super excited

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:35.660
and they're like wow that sounds like a really cool kind of job.

00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:36.090
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:39.065
&gt;&gt; What advice would you give them to either learn more or

00:07:39.065 --> 00:07:40.760
[COUGH].

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:42.530
What advice would you give them to learn more,

00:07:42.530 --> 00:07:46.540
or to possibly become a Clinical Operations Director themselves?

00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:47.730
&gt;&gt; I guess that the main advice would

00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:49.680
be not to just focus on drug companies, to

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:51.570
look across the board for other places that are

00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:54.740
running studies, and see if there are opportunities there.

00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:58.110
&gt;&gt; Would you recommend anybody who's interested to try

00:07:58.110 --> 00:08:01.920
to get work experience before school experience in this?

00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:03.620
&gt;&gt; I think work experience is the foot in

00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:06.300
the door that will help to land the job,

00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:06.520
yeah.

00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:08.640
&gt;&gt; And what kind of work experience exactly?

00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:12.630
&gt;&gt; so there're entry level positions to running

00:08:12.630 --> 00:08:16.240
clinical trials. They're, it's called a clinical trial associate.

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:16.680
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:22.220
&gt;&gt; but also background in a, in a physician's practice that are,

00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:26.270
where they're running studies is another great way to get exposure to it.

00:08:26.270 --> 00:08:28.120
&gt;&gt; Well, thank you so much for joining us,

00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:31.440
and you know, wish you the best of luck continuing

00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:33.120
your clinical operations.

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:33.379
&gt;&gt; Thank you.
