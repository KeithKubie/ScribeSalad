00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:01.264
- [Voiceover] All right, part d.

00:00:01.264 --> 00:00:02.651
Explain how any correct aspects

00:00:02.651 --> 00:00:05.066
of the student's reasoning
identified in part b

00:00:05.066 --> 00:00:09.362
are expressed by your mathematical
relationships in part c,

00:00:09.362 --> 00:00:11.823
and explain how your
relationship in part c correct,

00:00:11.823 --> 00:00:13.570
how your relationships in part c

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:16.211
correct any incorrect aspects
of the student's reasoning

00:00:16.211 --> 00:00:17.425
identified in part b.

00:00:17.425 --> 00:00:18.308
It's a bit of a mouthful,

00:00:18.308 --> 00:00:19.107
but they're just saying,

00:00:19.107 --> 00:00:21.665
"Hey, kinda connect the
dots between part c"

00:00:21.665 --> 00:00:23.194
"and the two parts of part b."

00:00:23.194 --> 00:00:25.453
Refer to the relationships
you wrote in part c,

00:00:25.453 --> 00:00:26.753
not just the final answer you obtained

00:00:26.753 --> 00:00:29.394
by manipulating those relationships.

00:00:29.394 --> 00:00:30.735
And so we can,

00:00:30.735 --> 00:00:33.487
let me write it down here.

00:00:33.487 --> 00:00:34.578
So d.

00:00:34.578 --> 00:00:37.468
So part c

00:00:37.468 --> 00:00:40.997
shows us

00:00:40.997 --> 00:00:44.361
that doubling,

00:00:44.361 --> 00:00:47.801
doubling compression

00:00:49.031 --> 00:00:53.287
does result in more potential energy.

00:00:53.287 --> 00:00:57.987
Doubling compression does result

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:03.498
in more,

00:01:03.498 --> 00:01:05.797
in more energy.

00:01:05.797 --> 00:01:08.258
And you could clarify that this is,

00:01:08.258 --> 00:01:11.207
this is potential,

00:01:11.207 --> 00:01:15.642
potential and kinetic

00:01:15.642 --> 00:01:17.476
at different points in time.

00:01:17.476 --> 00:01:19.636
And then we could even draw a line to it.

00:01:19.636 --> 00:01:21.424
So we see that,

00:01:21.424 --> 00:01:22.979
we see that right over here.

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.563
That is, that is these,

00:01:25.563 --> 00:01:26.703
that line,

00:01:26.703 --> 00:01:29.179
and then that line right
over there shows that.

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:32.299
So I could draw a bit of an arrow to it.

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:35.757
They want us to reference
some of what we saw before.

00:01:35.757 --> 00:01:38.188
And just to make it clear,

00:01:38.188 --> 00:01:39.976
I can put in parentheses.

00:01:39.976 --> 00:01:44.053
I can show that U two
is equal to four U one,

00:01:44.053 --> 00:01:49.053
and that K two is equal to four,

00:01:49.102 --> 00:01:52.491
four K one.

00:01:52.491 --> 00:01:56.573
However, however,

00:01:58.158 --> 00:02:00.224
however,

00:02:00.224 --> 00:02:04.884
since the kinetic energy,

00:02:04.884 --> 00:02:09.320
since the kinetic

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:12.402
energy

00:02:12.402 --> 00:02:17.332
is four times greater,

00:02:19.497 --> 00:02:24.000
and you have

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:31.300
the same, same force of friction,

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:36.447
force of friction,

00:02:36.447 --> 00:02:41.207
the distance is going to
be four times as long.

00:02:41.207 --> 00:02:44.151
The stopping distance,

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.825
distance,

00:02:47.825 --> 00:02:50.472
is going to be four times as much.

00:02:50.472 --> 00:02:54.434
Is going to be

00:02:54.434 --> 00:02:58.979
four times as long.

00:03:00.123 --> 00:03:00.842
And even when we,

00:03:00.842 --> 00:03:02.282
so the correct parts.

00:03:02.282 --> 00:03:04.674
Part c shows us that
doubling the compression

00:03:04.674 --> 00:03:07.251
does result in more energy.

00:03:07.251 --> 00:03:11.068
And I could add and
more stopping distance.

00:03:11.068 --> 00:03:12.804
Let me do it there.

00:03:12.804 --> 00:03:17.753
And more stopping,

00:03:19.535 --> 00:03:23.289
stopping distance.

00:03:23.289 --> 00:03:24.179
Whoops.

00:03:24.179 --> 00:03:25.780
And more stopping distance.

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:27.383
And the stopping distance,

00:03:27.383 --> 00:03:29.705
that arrow is easier to draw.

00:03:29.705 --> 00:03:32.491
And more stopping distance.

00:03:32.491 --> 00:03:36.276
However, since the kinetic
energy is four times greater,

00:03:36.276 --> 00:03:38.111
and you have the same force of friction,

00:03:38.111 --> 00:03:39.712
the stopping distance is going to be

00:03:39.712 --> 00:03:42.546
four times as long.

00:03:42.546 --> 00:03:45.050
And we saw that as well over there.

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.893
So we're saying hey look,

00:03:45.893 --> 00:03:47.747
the student was right

00:03:47.747 --> 00:03:50.162
that more compression is more energy,

00:03:50.162 --> 00:03:51.346
more stopping distance.

00:03:51.346 --> 00:03:53.668
However, it's going to
be four times as long,

00:03:53.668 --> 00:03:55.270
the stopping distance,

00:03:55.270 --> 00:04:00.130
not two times

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:02.081
as,

00:04:02.081 --> 00:04:03.798
not two times as far.

00:04:03.798 --> 00:04:05.690
And there you go.
