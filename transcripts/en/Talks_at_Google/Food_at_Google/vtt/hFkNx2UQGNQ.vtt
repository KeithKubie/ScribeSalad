00:00:01.857 --> 00:00:03.940
FEMALE SPEAKER: Thank you
everyone for being here.

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:04.730
Welcome today.

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:09.925
In 1986, Massimo Bottura
bought a roadside trattoria.

00:00:09.925 --> 00:00:13.000
He had no culinary
training and no experience.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.900
Despite this, the
restaurant, which

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:17.695
served traditional Emilian
dishes, was a great success.

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:22.340
In 1993, Alain Ducasse
visited the trattoria

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:26.740
and invited Massimo to cook at
Hotel de Paris in Monte Carlo.

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:28.970
After this life-changing
experience--

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:31.750
imagine going from a trattoria
to a three Michelin star

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:34.680
restaurant-- he opened
a new restaurant,

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.460
Osteria Francescana, in
Modena's Historic Center.

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:41.340
He was no longer cooking
traditional recipes,

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.090
but provocative
Italian renditions,

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:45.030
which were received with
skepticism and doubt.

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.120
In fact, it took 10 years from
receiving his first Michelin

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:53.020
star in 2001 to receiving his
third star, Michelin's highest

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:54.980
rating, in 2012.

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:56.090
Why?

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:58.740
Because in Italy, the idea
of tradition and evolution

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:00.195
is not easy for
anyone to accept.

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:03.960
Today, the restaurant is
rated the best in Italy.

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.400
And for the second
consecutive year,

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.070
Osteria Francescana ranked
third in San Pellegrino's list

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:13.000
of the world's 50
best restaurants.

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:17.190
Massimo's food blends
tradition with innovation,

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:20.120
managing to capture the essence
of classic Italian dishes

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:21.980
via modern expressions.

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:23.500
One of the ways he
achieves this is

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.870
by marrying his passion
for food with his love

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:27.790
of contemporary art.

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:29.410
He is also known for
the playful names

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:31.770
he gives his dishes,
like a signature dish,

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.150
Oops, I Dropped the Lemon Tart.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.240
Earlier this week,
on Jimmy Kimmel,

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.820
he made and fed Jimmy his iconic
recipe, Memory of a Mortadella

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:40.320
Sandwich.

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:43.880
We have a three-minute
video to show you now

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.840
of Massimo in his
restaurant in Modena, Italy.

00:01:48.322 --> 00:01:49.350
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:01:54.820 --> 00:02:01.094
-I'm born and I grew up in the
land of fast car and slow food.

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.690
I learned, since I was a
kid, to think very quick.

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:10.560
As the Roman they were
saying, think quick.

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.455
Do it very quick, but slowly.

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.680
That means have a very quick
thought, but do it slowly.

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.850
Because you need a lot
of time to do something.

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:28.107
They interpret
what I'm thinking,

00:02:28.107 --> 00:02:29.440
and they know what I'm thinking.

00:02:31.938 --> 00:02:32.872
So here we go.

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:37.132
Oops, We Dropped the Lemon Tart.

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:47.121
Food, for Italians, is like
the soccer team, or the Pope,

00:02:47.121 --> 00:02:48.880
or the food-- in order.

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.260
Soccer team first, Pope
second, tradition third.

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.880
I remember all these
gastronomic trips

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.670
I took with my older
brothers because my mom was

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:00.740
pushing me-- go, go, go.

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:02.460
Don't just play soccer.

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:04.215
Because I was playing
soccer every day.

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:08.395
I think of those
kinds of experiences--

00:03:08.395 --> 00:03:11.380
they were a totally
important part of my life.

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:14.060
Because going on Mont
Saint-Michel or [? Angelo ?]

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:16.840
[? Gallo ?] visiting
the wine cellar.

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:21.090
Drive to Nice, eat
oyster, get drunk,

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:22.290
going back for the night.

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:27.160
And say Mom, but Massimo,
where have you been?

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:28.530
Uh, studying.

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:29.840
[ITALIAN]

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:34.460
How can I forget about
the taste of lasagna?

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:37.270
It's impossible.

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:40.450
Or the piece of
Parmesan, or a drop

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:42.810
of 50 years old
balsamic vinegar.

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:44.500
That's magic.

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:48.530
So what we have to do is
just that see everything

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:51.820
from the distance, see what's
wrong and what's right,

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:54.980
and bring just the best
part into the future.

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:01.330
The book is going to be about
my passion, the evolution

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:07.410
of my ideas-- food, a
dose of art, and music.

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:10.650
Maybe, as I always
said, through passion,

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:12.820
I'm going to transfer emotions.

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:16.829
Maybe the book, at the end,
is going to be about emotion.

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:17.630
I don't know.

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:18.269
I hope so.

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:24.310
Get deep into things is one
of the most important things.

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:27.060
I hope people that
are going to read--

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:29.850
how is the structure
of creativity,

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:32.280
and they're going to be
inspired by this structure.

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:34.850
Express yourself.

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:35.991
That's the point.

00:04:35.991 --> 00:04:36.490
Feel free.

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:36.990
Be brave.

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:40.680
I always say to
the young chef, be

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:43.280
focused on what is your dream.

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:44.780
You can realize that.

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:50.220
That's the scary part. [LAUGH]

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:51.116
[END PLAYBACK]

00:04:51.116 --> 00:04:53.615
FEMALE SPEAKER: Please join me
in welcoming Massimo Bottura.

00:04:54.832 --> 00:04:59.542
[APPLAUSE]

00:04:59.542 --> 00:05:00.750
MASSIMO BOTTURA: Hi everyone.

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:04.310
I'm Massimo Bottura.

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:05.750
I'm an Italian chef.

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:09.363
And I grew up in
Modena-- Modena,

00:05:09.363 --> 00:05:14.430
in the middle of Emilia-Romagna,
in the center of Italy.

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:20.240
So it is where the Ferrari
car, the Maserati, Lamborghini,

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:23.622
Ducati, are made, but
also Parmigiano-Reggiano,

00:05:23.622 --> 00:05:24.330
balsamic vinegar.

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:28.600
So it's like is
the land of-- as I

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:32.050
said-- slow food and fast car.

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:41.060
I grew up in a very large family
in which my older brothers,

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:45.180
they were chasing me all the
time, because I was the younger

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:45.990
one.

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:50.780
And my safety place
was the kitchen,

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:52.830
where my grandmother
was rolling pasta.

00:05:54.026 --> 00:05:58.040
And I could sneak
under the table,

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:01.220
and she was defending
me with the mattarello,

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:03.125
rolling the pasta,
saying, get out of here.

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:08.140
Just because he's the
younger one-- get out!

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:13.280
So in the meantime, I was
stealing the tortellini

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:14.840
from up.

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:18.310
And for me, that's
why tortellini

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:26.090
are the most important and the
most iconic dish of my life,

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:28.310
and especially when
they are rolled.

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:31.590
Because you can feel exactly
the flavor of the filling.

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:40.279
My father was planning
for me to be a lawyer.

00:06:40.279 --> 00:06:40.945
Can you imagine?

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:48.840
And so after two
years of my studies,

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:53.420
I dropped everything--
because my passion

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:56.640
were food, art, and music.

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:01.080
And out of the
blue, we found out

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:05.450
that there was a small
trattoria outside of Modena

00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:06.700
called Trattoria del Campazzo.

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:11.230
I didn't even know
where it was--

00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:13.460
a small village
with three houses

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:15.790
and a small restaurant
in the middle.

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:19.450
My brother took
me there and said,

00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:21.245
this is the perfect
place for you.

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:25.670
It's the place where
you can express yourself

00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:28.190
through the food,
through your passion.

00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:32.935
Said to Paolo, what do you
think is-- are you sure?

00:07:32.935 --> 00:07:34.390
He said, yes.

00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:35.540
This is the perfect place.

00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:41.050
One week later, I was there,
because the food world

00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:42.050
chose me.

00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:44.510
It's not that I chose that.

00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:45.960
That was the perfect timing.

00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:52.500
And in that moment,
I realized I had

00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:55.570
to put all myself
into this world,

00:07:55.570 --> 00:08:01.530
because I have to show
everyone it was so right,

00:08:01.530 --> 00:08:02.530
the choice I made.

00:08:03.610 --> 00:08:11.267
And the simplest interest
for food, step by step,

00:08:11.267 --> 00:08:11.975
became a passion.

00:08:13.130 --> 00:08:15.020
And through the
passion, I realized

00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:16.105
you can transfer emotions.

00:08:17.210 --> 00:08:22.800
That what I think food is, and
how I interpret the food-- just

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:24.090
transfer emotions.

00:08:28.090 --> 00:08:32.830
I cooked in Trattoria del
Campazzo for seven years.

00:08:32.830 --> 00:08:37.510
Since once a great chef
from France, Alain Ducasse,

00:08:37.510 --> 00:08:39.770
came and met me.

00:08:39.770 --> 00:08:45.890
He invited me to work at Hotel
de Paris, in Monte Carlo.

00:08:45.890 --> 00:08:46.890
So I went there.

00:08:46.890 --> 00:08:47.970
I left everything.

00:08:47.970 --> 00:08:53.280
I went there and I started
learning, working like 16 hours

00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:55.760
a day-- so to learn
everything, from chocolate

00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:58.880
to bread, baking, everything.

00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:04.310
And since they called
me, Trattoria de Campazzo

00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:08.584
and the [? club-- ?]
Massimo, we need you.

00:09:08.584 --> 00:09:09.500
You have to come back.

00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:10.430
So I left.

00:09:10.430 --> 00:09:12.860
I have to go back
to my real life.

00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:14.360
That was a dream, a bubble.

00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:20.850
And in the moment I was
living in Monte Carlo,

00:09:20.850 --> 00:09:24.000
I met Mr. Ducasse in
the hall of the hotel.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:29.220
And he was asking me, you
know, so, Massimo, did you do?

00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:30.830
Did you have a good experience?

00:09:30.830 --> 00:09:32.640
You know, the classic question.

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:33.780
I said, fantastic.

00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:34.560
Look at this.

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:39.560
I have the whole notebook full
of everything, also recipes

00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:41.550
that I've stolen from there.

00:09:41.550 --> 00:09:46.640
So he looked at
me very carefully.

00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:52.250
He grabbed the notebook,
and he crash in the middle,

00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:55.180
and he throw in the
garbage, saying,

00:09:55.180 --> 00:09:58.360
you are ready to stand
up with your feet.

00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:00.850
Just walk.

00:10:00.850 --> 00:10:02.030
I was like, in shock.

00:10:02.030 --> 00:10:07.370
I was like, all these months,
all these hours-- you know,

00:10:07.370 --> 00:10:11.960
the sweating and the experience,
everything in the garbage.

00:10:13.150 --> 00:10:14.970
But that was the most
important experience

00:10:14.970 --> 00:10:18.550
of my life, the moment
that changed my life.

00:10:18.550 --> 00:10:22.030
Because in that moment,
in that exact moment,

00:10:22.030 --> 00:10:27.440
I felt I had to do and
I had to express myself

00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:30.530
through what I've learned
in all of these months.

00:10:31.730 --> 00:10:33.945
One year later, we opened
Osteria Francescana.

00:10:37.390 --> 00:10:39.830
But everything changed
because of the experience

00:10:39.830 --> 00:10:41.150
in New York and Monte Carlo.

00:10:41.150 --> 00:10:47.030
So those recipes-- they were
so successful in Campazzo,

00:10:47.030 --> 00:10:49.570
in the middle of
the country, they

00:10:49.570 --> 00:10:52.680
couldn't match with
Osteria Francescana,

00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:55.070
because my mind was
already changed.

00:10:55.070 --> 00:10:59.180
And I started thinking about
tradition, but in evolution.

00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:02.160
I was looking at the
terroir in a different way.

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:06.230
A big wheel of Parmigiano
was no more a cheese to eat,

00:11:06.230 --> 00:11:08.320
but was something
much more deep.

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:11.400
A drop of balsamic
vinegar was something

00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:15.920
that I had to respect and
see in a different way,

00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:17.710
maybe from under the table.

00:11:17.710 --> 00:11:18.830
I don't know.

00:11:18.830 --> 00:11:27.500
And like that, I started with
my wife this dialogue with art.

00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:35.040
And art-- usually the eye is
the expression of a human being.

00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:38.020
And it makes visible
the invisible.

00:11:38.020 --> 00:11:42.800
So starting from there,
compressing all of these ideas,

00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:45.780
we started creating
edible bites where

00:11:45.780 --> 00:11:49.035
culture became our
motivational force.

00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:56.750
So a few years later,
I had the opportunity

00:11:56.750 --> 00:12:01.120
to meet Ferran Adria, this
Spanish chef who was creating,

00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:04.910
in his restaurant, elBulli,
a revolution on technique.

00:12:04.910 --> 00:12:07.470
And he invited me there, too.

00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:11.220
And so I left
everything another time,

00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:13.390
and I went to elBulli to learn.

00:12:13.390 --> 00:12:17.550
And I was thinking to learn
all of these techniques

00:12:17.550 --> 00:12:22.500
that they could
make me maybe create

00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:23.870
a foam of Parmigiano-Reggiano.

00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:26.020
I don't know.

00:12:26.020 --> 00:12:30.060
And but actually what
Ferran was teaching

00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:34.810
me was freedom-- freedom
to express yourself,

00:12:34.810 --> 00:12:39.410
the freedom of thinking
and looking inside you,

00:12:39.410 --> 00:12:45.710
and bring out all
these memories, ideas,

00:12:45.710 --> 00:12:49.790
through technique but
creative gestures.

00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:54.170
I came back from the
experience at elBulli

00:12:54.170 --> 00:12:58.000
and all these gastronomic
critics in Italy--

00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.210
can you imagine?

00:12:59.210 --> 00:13:06.190
In Italy, you don't have to
touch three things-- the Pope,

00:13:06.190 --> 00:13:11.260
the national soccer team,
and the grandmother recipes.

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:12.570
You can do whatever you want.

00:13:12.570 --> 00:13:16.880
You can do whatever you want,
but not these three things.

00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:18.374
So I was like, oh my god.

00:13:18.374 --> 00:13:19.290
What am I going to do?

00:13:19.290 --> 00:13:20.500
What am I going to do?

00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:22.902
But these gastronomic
critics and the chefs,

00:13:22.902 --> 00:13:25.110
they were playing jokes--
oh, what is he going to do?

00:13:25.110 --> 00:13:27.290
Bottura, he's going to
make like mortadella foam.

00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:30.640
That's a great idea.

00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:31.860
That's a beautiful idea.

00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:33.940
So I'm going to make
a mortadella foam.

00:13:33.940 --> 00:13:35.030
Why?

00:13:35.030 --> 00:13:37.630
In honor of my
mother-- that she was

00:13:37.630 --> 00:13:40.730
the one who pushed me
to be and to follow

00:13:40.730 --> 00:13:42.990
my passion through the kitchen.

00:13:42.990 --> 00:13:50.140
And since I was 14, she was
bringing a bologna sandwich--

00:13:50.140 --> 00:13:52.570
are you calling mortadella
bologna right here?

00:13:52.570 --> 00:13:56.990
So bologna sandwich-- that's
bologna, from Bologna--

00:13:56.990 --> 00:14:00.464
in a backpack, saying,
Massimo, [ITALIAN].

00:14:00.464 --> 00:14:01.130
You have to eat.

00:14:01.130 --> 00:14:03.840
You have to eat if
you want to grow.

00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:05.390
Not just playing soccer.

00:14:05.390 --> 00:14:12.340
And for that
reason, I just start

00:14:12.340 --> 00:14:17.320
thinking about those kinds of
things that are icons for us.

00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:21.440
But trying not to see
and to look at them

00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:25.780
in a nostalgic way,
but in a critic way--

00:14:25.780 --> 00:14:28.160
to bring the best from
the past into the future.

00:14:29.230 --> 00:14:33.990
So one recipe from
another, I started

00:14:33.990 --> 00:14:40.020
getting so
irreverent, so ironic.

00:14:40.020 --> 00:14:43.370
So I was creating
all these plates that

00:14:43.370 --> 00:14:46.370
would provocate people,
provocate the mind.

00:14:46.370 --> 00:14:49.400
But just to attract
the point of view,

00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:52.070
like Tortellini are
Walking on the Broth.

00:14:53.130 --> 00:14:54.590
Serving six tortellini.

00:14:54.590 --> 00:14:57.260
Can you imagine in Modena
serving six tortellini

00:14:57.260 --> 00:14:58.750
in the middle of the broth?

00:14:58.750 --> 00:15:01.922
They were like, what the
hell is he going to do?

00:15:01.922 --> 00:15:02.880
Or what they think is--

00:15:04.020 --> 00:15:06.890
Or Compression of
Pasta and Beans.

00:15:06.890 --> 00:15:08.840
In Compression of
Pasta and Beans,

00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:13.320
I was just thinking about
creating my gastronomic life,

00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:17.830
compress my gastronomic
life into a small glass,

00:15:17.830 --> 00:15:20.554
serving pasta and beans-- one
of the most classic recipes

00:15:20.554 --> 00:15:21.470
of Italian gastronomy.

00:15:22.990 --> 00:15:25.220
But in Compression
of Pasta and Beans,

00:15:25.220 --> 00:15:30.120
I create this sortification
process in a small glass.

00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:34.100
Where at the bottom, there
was like my experience

00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:35.710
with French cuisine.

00:15:35.710 --> 00:15:40.730
So and I was creating
this creme royale.

00:15:40.730 --> 00:15:41.820
Do you know the French?

00:15:41.820 --> 00:15:42.349
No?

00:15:42.349 --> 00:15:42.890
Creme royale.

00:15:44.190 --> 00:15:46.387
So they were adding a
little bit of foie gras.

00:15:46.387 --> 00:15:47.595
It's like "Pulp Fiction", no?

00:15:49.060 --> 00:15:50.259
Royale with cheese.

00:15:50.259 --> 00:15:51.300
It's just a cheeseburger.

00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:52.660
OK?

00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:55.970
So pig skin, beans,
and foie gras.

00:15:55.970 --> 00:15:59.280
And I created this creme
royale on the bottom.

00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:03.890
Then some brunoise
of red radicchio,

00:16:03.890 --> 00:16:05.460
so a little bit of bitterness.

00:16:05.460 --> 00:16:07.715
Saute it with red
wine-- so acidity.

00:16:08.780 --> 00:16:15.690
Then a creamy sauce of beans,
as a very traditional style.

00:16:15.690 --> 00:16:23.430
And then ending with a foam
of very air of rosemary.

00:16:23.430 --> 00:16:27.170
Because rosemary is very
intense and very aggressive.

00:16:27.170 --> 00:16:29.820
So creating an air
of rosemary, you

00:16:29.820 --> 00:16:33.410
have just a little
touch in the back part

00:16:33.410 --> 00:16:36.410
of the palate of the
flavor of rosemary.

00:16:36.410 --> 00:16:40.170
So the first homage
was for Ducasse,

00:16:40.170 --> 00:16:44.230
and the last one was
for Ferran Adria--

00:16:44.230 --> 00:16:46.210
my first and my last
gastronomic experience.

00:16:46.210 --> 00:16:49.440
But in the middle,
instead of serving pasta,

00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:54.290
I introduce Parmigiano-Reggiano
crust boiled into the beans.

00:16:54.290 --> 00:16:57.110
As my grandmother would
say-- because that's

00:16:57.110 --> 00:17:00.470
a secret that every
grandmother knows.

00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:05.920
But I sliced across the
Parmigiano as they were pasta.

00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:10.950
So this kind of
[ITALIAN] like bad cuts.

00:17:10.950 --> 00:17:15.990
So between Ducasse and Ferran
Adria, I put my grandmother.

00:17:15.990 --> 00:17:18.849
That's the idea of
the pasta and beans.

00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:27.000
And after all these years
and all this experience,

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.760
we realized that
we were creating

00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:32.390
a very interesting cuisine.

00:17:32.390 --> 00:17:35.270
Because everyone was looking
at us, and especially

00:17:35.270 --> 00:17:36.450
the Michelin Guide.

00:17:38.230 --> 00:17:42.770
And we arrived, at
one point, in which

00:17:42.770 --> 00:17:45.060
we started getting all
these awards and things.

00:17:45.060 --> 00:17:51.050
But people, they
keep giving us space

00:17:51.050 --> 00:17:56.700
in which we had like
this point, this critic

00:17:56.700 --> 00:18:05.520
point of our creativity.

00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:11.290
And at that point,
the dialogue with art

00:18:11.290 --> 00:18:13.650
started getting
more deep and deep.

00:18:13.650 --> 00:18:16.560
And we started
creating plates as they

00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:23.030
were like, more emotional
than just traditional,

00:18:23.030 --> 00:18:26.710
as we are explaining
in the book.

00:18:26.710 --> 00:18:32.720
So we create plates that-- they
start dialogues with yourself,

00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:37.800
with my mind, with the
approach with the people.

00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:40.020
Like, Oops, I Dropped
the Lemon Tart.

00:18:40.020 --> 00:18:41.520
Oops, I Dropped the Lemon Tart.

00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:44.170
Or 1,000 Layers of Leaves.

00:18:44.170 --> 00:18:50.760
It means in a word like this,
full of obsession, obsession

00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:56.620
and obligation, in which
you have, every day,

00:18:56.620 --> 00:18:57.460
I have to go here.

00:18:57.460 --> 00:18:58.310
I have to go there.

00:18:59.390 --> 00:19:02.570
I have to-- the lawyer and
the account and the bank.

00:19:02.570 --> 00:19:04.390
I have to pay the bills.

00:19:04.390 --> 00:19:10.020
You know, if you don't leave a
little space open for poetry,

00:19:10.020 --> 00:19:12.650
this life is going to
disappear like this.

00:19:12.650 --> 00:19:17.690
And if you see
that moment and you

00:19:17.690 --> 00:19:21.280
realize that those moments are
the moments, the most important

00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:26.760
moments in which you can jump
and feel the poetry inside you,

00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:31.025
it's the moment in which you
are in the middle of a service.

00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:34.605
You have your
pastry chef that is

00:19:34.605 --> 00:19:37.220
ready to serve two lemon tart.

00:19:37.220 --> 00:19:40.640
And these are Japanese
guys-- the most precise guys

00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:43.640
in the world, and the
most incredible talented.

00:19:44.770 --> 00:19:47.030
And he drops one of
the two lemon tarts.

00:19:48.230 --> 00:19:50.980
And he's like, ready
to kill himself.

00:19:50.980 --> 00:19:53.250
And he's like, what the hell?

00:19:53.250 --> 00:19:54.270
What's going on?

00:19:54.270 --> 00:19:58.330
I said Taka, it's the most
beautiful tart you can serve.

00:19:58.330 --> 00:19:59.880
It's the imperfection.

00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:02.930
Because you're so perfect
that you create something

00:20:02.930 --> 00:20:05.510
imperfect that I love it.

00:20:05.510 --> 00:20:10.530
And that's the moment in
which we jump into the poetry,

00:20:10.530 --> 00:20:12.720
and we imagine and
we see the world

00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:15.590
from another point of
view, from under the table.

00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:19.200
And in that moment, we create
Oops, I Dropped the Lemon Tart.

00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:22.140
It became an icon of the
international cuisine.

00:20:22.140 --> 00:20:27.090
So what is the book?

00:20:27.090 --> 00:20:34.720
The book is the compression
of 20 years of our work,

00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:40.450
the compression of our passion--
the art, the music, the food.

00:20:40.450 --> 00:20:42.985
It's storytelling.

00:20:44.370 --> 00:20:48.600
Every recipe is a story. it's
more a book about creativity.

00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:50.520
It's more a book about memory.

00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:58.200
What is Italy in
a very deep way?

00:20:58.200 --> 00:21:06.040
Look at foggy parts of Bologna
or the wind of Pantelleria

00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:10.340
that is like giving this
feeling of salty capers

00:21:10.340 --> 00:21:12.590
naturally in the
middle of the sea.

00:21:12.590 --> 00:21:18.370
The magic flavor of an almond
of Noto, or like anchovies

00:21:18.370 --> 00:21:21.040
water from the Gulf of Sorrento.

00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:22.290
So it's about that.

00:21:22.290 --> 00:21:24.140
It's about emotion.

00:21:24.140 --> 00:21:30.190
And it's about the whole life
that I dedicate with my wife,

00:21:30.190 --> 00:21:34.490
with my team-- that I never
forget about the team--

00:21:34.490 --> 00:21:39.830
to create and to give to
everyone, to the young chef,

00:21:39.830 --> 00:21:43.145
the opportunity to imagine
and to dream about the future.

00:21:43.987 --> 00:21:44.820
Thank you very much.

00:21:52.040 --> 00:21:54.140
You're going to
taste-- we brought

00:21:54.140 --> 00:21:57.070
some balsamic vinegar
and some Parmigiano.

00:21:57.070 --> 00:22:02.370
So it's like my
blood in the vein

00:22:02.370 --> 00:22:07.010
and the cheese that made
my muscles like that.

00:22:07.010 --> 00:22:08.640
So I'm not that skinny, right?

00:22:11.070 --> 00:22:15.050
And so just to say,
this vinegar-- and I'm

00:22:15.050 --> 00:22:19.355
very proud of-- just won the
gold medal in Spilamberto

00:22:19.355 --> 00:22:20.730
as the best vinegar
in the world.

00:22:20.730 --> 00:22:23.620
So it's very important
for us that everyone

00:22:23.620 --> 00:22:27.670
thinks that we are so avant
garde, but it's not true.

00:22:29.450 --> 00:22:31.650
We have the feet very
deep into tradition,

00:22:31.650 --> 00:22:33.620
and we really care about that.

00:22:33.620 --> 00:22:35.960
And this is the
expression of what

00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:39.110
we are through Parmigianos,
balsamic vinegar.

00:22:39.110 --> 00:22:43.070
To think about we grew
up as kids listening

00:22:43.070 --> 00:22:46.340
to the sound of the pipes of
the Ferrari or the Maserati.

00:22:47.380 --> 00:22:58.260
But at the end, in a dark
part of the house, where

00:22:58.260 --> 00:23:03.360
the winter hits very heavy or
the summer is getting boiling,

00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:05.660
[INAUDIBLE], there
is balsamic vinegar

00:23:05.660 --> 00:23:10.640
that stayed there for
decades and became,

00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:14.150
after years and years
and years, a liquid gold.

00:23:14.150 --> 00:23:16.600
This is crazy, no?

00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:21.060
For 2014, thinking about that
you create a product that

00:23:21.060 --> 00:23:23.380
takes, like, 25 years
before it tastes?

00:23:25.330 --> 00:23:29.820
But I just brought to share with
you with this kind of emotion.

00:23:33.509 --> 00:23:35.300
FEMALE SPEAKER: Thank
you so much, Massimo.

00:23:35.300 --> 00:23:38.810
We have time for 5, 10
minutes of questions,

00:23:38.810 --> 00:23:40.446
if anyone has a
question they'd like

00:23:40.446 --> 00:23:41.987
to ask while we're
doing the tasting.

00:23:42.510 --> 00:23:44.330
AUDIENCE: If there
was one American chef

00:23:44.330 --> 00:23:45.830
you could work for,
who would it be?

00:23:46.964 --> 00:23:48.380
MASSIMO BOTTURA:
I could work for?

00:23:48.380 --> 00:23:49.426
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:23:49.426 --> 00:23:50.650
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:50.650 --> 00:23:53.142
MASSIMO BOTTURA: This is--
this is something that--

00:23:53.142 --> 00:23:54.600
AUDIENCE: Who would
you stage with?

00:23:54.600 --> 00:23:56.308
MASSIMO BOTTURA: I
never work for anyone.

00:23:56.308 --> 00:23:59.060
I work for Ray [? Costantini ?]
in New York, when

00:23:59.060 --> 00:24:02.990
it was 1993-- where
I met my wife, Lara.

00:24:02.990 --> 00:24:04.870
And it was Cafe de [? Nona ?].

00:24:04.870 --> 00:24:09.090
He was a Calabrian
guy, hairdresser.

00:24:10.140 --> 00:24:13.000
And he was giving
party to his house.

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:15.500
And everyone would say, oh, Ray.

00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:17.440
You're so good at cooking.

00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:19.190
You just have to
open a restaurant.

00:24:19.190 --> 00:24:23.230
It was like, when I met him,
he was sleeping in the basement

00:24:23.230 --> 00:24:25.860
after the first
month of opening.

00:24:25.860 --> 00:24:27.610
He didn't know
anything about food,

00:24:27.610 --> 00:24:28.860
anything about the restaurant.

00:24:28.860 --> 00:24:32.282
He was so tired that he was
like, sleeping in the basement.

00:24:32.282 --> 00:24:32.990
I worked for him.

00:24:32.990 --> 00:24:33.794
AUDIENCE: Nice.

00:24:33.794 --> 00:24:35.000
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:39.040
And the second question is,
hypothetically it's 12:00 AM.

00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:41.890
You've had a couple
glasses of wine.

00:24:41.890 --> 00:24:43.556
What are you going
to cook for yourself?

00:24:43.837 --> 00:24:44.920
MASSIMO BOTTURA: 12:00 AM?

00:24:46.936 --> 00:24:48.469
A glass of wine?

00:24:48.469 --> 00:24:49.260
What glass of wine?

00:24:51.410 --> 00:24:52.280
AUDIENCE: Barolo.

00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:53.095
Red.

00:24:53.095 --> 00:24:54.339
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:24:54.339 --> 00:24:54.880
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:24:54.880 --> 00:24:55.380
Barolo.

00:24:58.430 --> 00:25:00.700
MASSIMO BOTTURA: What
I cook for myself.

00:25:00.700 --> 00:25:04.890
Actually, a glass of Barolo
at midnight can be by itself.

00:25:04.890 --> 00:25:06.070
You know?

00:25:06.070 --> 00:25:09.560
No, because it's like-- you
know, Barolo is [INAUDIBLE].

00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:11.090
You eat and you drink.

00:25:11.090 --> 00:25:13.600
Because it's so
complex that when

00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:16.180
you feel the Barolo,
you just, in the nose,

00:25:16.180 --> 00:25:17.970
you have red fruit.

00:25:17.970 --> 00:25:19.170
You have toasted almond.

00:25:20.330 --> 00:25:24.560
You have the old earth--
also truffles sometimes.

00:25:24.560 --> 00:25:28.730
And it's so complex
that, you know, choose

00:25:28.730 --> 00:25:31.580
something at midnight like
that is a tricky question.

00:25:33.610 --> 00:25:34.110
No.

00:25:34.110 --> 00:25:34.651
I don't know.

00:25:34.651 --> 00:25:38.510
Something-- maybe a culatello,
like a slice of culatello,

00:25:38.510 --> 00:25:39.830
very old.

00:25:39.830 --> 00:25:45.150
You chew the same feeling,
like a porcini mushroom,

00:25:45.150 --> 00:25:46.350
black truffle.

00:25:46.350 --> 00:25:48.820
AUDIENCE: What would
you eat for street food

00:25:48.820 --> 00:25:49.920
if you were traveling?

00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:52.880
MASSIMO BOTTURA: Street
food is I love street food.

00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:55.910
Actually, in two days, I'm
going to cook street food too.

00:25:57.340 --> 00:25:59.830
I'm going in New
York, and I create

00:25:59.830 --> 00:26:04.020
a burger for Shake
Shack for Columbus Day.

00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:08.500
And it's going to be
a burger in which I

00:26:08.500 --> 00:26:13.280
mix some beef with cotechino.

00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:15.070
Are you familiar with cotechino?

00:26:15.070 --> 00:26:17.800
Cotechino is a sausage,
very traditional,

00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:21.820
created 500 years ago in
Mirandola, a small village

00:26:21.820 --> 00:26:23.240
outside of Modena.

00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:28.100
And it's just pig ground
with also the skin

00:26:28.100 --> 00:26:31.580
part, that you cook
and you defat it.

00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:38.130
But it's very gelatinous,
and it's incredible

00:26:38.130 --> 00:26:40.480
when there is no
fat, because you

00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:41.900
feel the gelatin everywhere.

00:26:41.900 --> 00:26:44.480
And so I ground this meat.

00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:50.100
I cook it and I mix it with
the gelatin with the beef,

00:26:50.100 --> 00:26:52.680
and some sum
Parmigiano-Reggiano.

00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:57.600
So like 30% to 20% of
cotechino, 70% of meat,

00:26:57.600 --> 00:26:59.540
and 10% of Parmigiano-Reggiano.

00:26:59.540 --> 00:27:02.760
So it's the perfect umami
with the gelatin inside.

00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:06.510
And salsa verde,
as Emilia-Romagna,

00:27:06.510 --> 00:27:09.640
we serve close to the
meat with acidity,

00:27:09.640 --> 00:27:14.160
the chlorophyll of the salad, so
imagine these kinds of things.

00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:18.620
And the mayonnaise made with
balsamic vinegar for the fries.

00:27:19.787 --> 00:27:20.412
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:27:20.412 --> 00:27:22.120
That's Michelin Star
quality street food.

00:27:24.125 --> 00:27:25.250
MASSIMO BOTTURA: I hope so.

00:27:25.250 --> 00:27:26.570
I hope so.

00:27:26.570 --> 00:27:30.010
The point is that
everyone is tweeting that.

00:27:30.010 --> 00:27:34.730
And every single website is
like talking, ah, Columbus Day--

00:27:34.730 --> 00:27:35.900
everyone at Madison Park.

00:27:35.900 --> 00:27:38.210
So can you imagine what's
going on in Madison Park?

00:27:39.990 --> 00:27:43.310
Just last night I was sleeping,
and I wake up like that.

00:27:43.310 --> 00:27:46.070
I see 3,000 people there
waiting for the burger.

00:27:47.380 --> 00:27:48.516
What I'm supposed to do?

00:27:48.516 --> 00:27:49.432
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:27:51.740 --> 00:27:55.080
AUDIENCE: I just wanted
to talk about criticism.

00:27:55.080 --> 00:27:58.710
And I know Italians are very
outspoken in their criticism.

00:27:58.710 --> 00:27:59.419
And you kind of--

00:27:59.419 --> 00:28:00.418
MASSIMO BOTTURA: Really?

00:28:00.418 --> 00:28:01.230
I didn't know that.

00:28:01.230 --> 00:28:02.040
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:02.540
It's new.

00:28:02.540 --> 00:28:03.900
It's new.

00:28:03.900 --> 00:28:07.080
But you sort of went
away from tradition.

00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:10.550
You almost shocked a culture.

00:28:10.550 --> 00:28:12.856
How do you deal with the
criticism on a daily basis,

00:28:12.856 --> 00:28:14.730
in the restaurant,
outside of the restaurant?

00:28:14.839 --> 00:28:16.380
MASSIMO BOTTURA:
You know, yesterday,

00:28:16.380 --> 00:28:22.990
in the most important
guide, l'Espresso guide,

00:28:22.990 --> 00:28:25.480
from Italy-- it's like
37 years of history.

00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:29.410
He came out for the
fifth time, sixth time,

00:28:29.410 --> 00:28:32.370
like, best chef, best
restaurant in Italy.

00:28:32.370 --> 00:28:35.860
And instead of
saying, ah, great!

00:28:35.860 --> 00:28:39.090
It's beautiful What
a restaurant we have.

00:28:39.090 --> 00:28:40.140
Is like, oh.

00:28:40.140 --> 00:28:41.080
What boring.

00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:42.960
It's always [INAUDIBLE].

00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:46.760
It's like, you know--
what I'm supposed to say?

00:28:46.760 --> 00:28:49.470
Say thank you, or
what do I have to do?

00:28:49.470 --> 00:28:54.150
And it's like, still,
now, after everything,

00:28:54.150 --> 00:28:57.974
there are people that are coming
in with the five different age

00:28:57.974 --> 00:29:00.015
of Parmigiano-Reggiano
and five different texture

00:29:00.015 --> 00:29:00.681
and temperature.

00:29:00.681 --> 00:29:03.530
You know, an iconic
dish that you see

00:29:03.530 --> 00:29:06.790
and that have the
recipe in the book.

00:29:06.790 --> 00:29:10.860
And in the beginning, it
was creating 20 years ago.

00:29:10.860 --> 00:29:17.380
And after it evolved in '98,
the aging process, and 2002,

00:29:17.380 --> 00:29:22.000
and 2011, it has been
declared the plate

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:24.170
of the decade for
Italian gastronomy.

00:29:24.170 --> 00:29:26.190
So it's like an
incredible honor.

00:29:27.605 --> 00:29:31.414
Like two weeks ago, there was
a customer that was like, yeah,

00:29:31.414 --> 00:29:35.160
it's good, but, you know, I
would put something like that,

00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:36.820
and I would change this.

00:29:36.820 --> 00:29:38.830
And I say, oh,
that's a good idea.

00:29:38.830 --> 00:29:43.010
I'm going to take notes, and
I'm going to think about that.

00:29:43.010 --> 00:29:44.330
What do you have to say?

00:29:45.370 --> 00:29:46.510
It's normal.

00:29:46.510 --> 00:29:49.070
In Italy, for me,
I'm used to it.

00:29:49.070 --> 00:29:51.370
So there's no problem.

00:29:51.370 --> 00:29:54.370
15 years ago, I risk
to get the burned

00:29:54.370 --> 00:29:57.050
in the main piazza as a witch.

00:29:58.760 --> 00:29:59.690
So.

00:29:59.690 --> 00:30:01.231
FEMALE SPEAKER: We
can take two more.

00:30:01.627 --> 00:30:02.210
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:30:02.210 --> 00:30:05.530
I had a question on how
you made your vinegar so

00:30:05.530 --> 00:30:09.170
fruitful and sour, on
that perfect blend?

00:30:09.170 --> 00:30:12.220
MASSIMO BOTTURA:
It's just a question.

00:30:12.220 --> 00:30:16.130
It's just a way of waiting.

00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:19.492
Choose the right barrels.

00:30:19.492 --> 00:30:20.450
Choose the right woods.

00:30:22.470 --> 00:30:26.190
Make the perfect musto--
the must, the reduction

00:30:26.190 --> 00:30:30.250
of the grape juice.

00:30:31.450 --> 00:30:33.660
And then wait.

00:30:33.660 --> 00:30:35.940
And then trust your palate.

00:30:35.940 --> 00:30:39.695
Every single wood is
giving you something.

00:30:40.760 --> 00:30:42.270
It's talking to you.

00:30:42.270 --> 00:30:46.200
Like you have juniper,
and it's telling you

00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:51.210
that you're going to have
incense, chocolate, coffee.

00:30:51.210 --> 00:30:52.960
You have cherry wood.

00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:56.960
You're going to have sour
cherry, fresh red fruit,

00:30:56.960 --> 00:30:58.600
a little bit of plants.

00:30:58.600 --> 00:30:59.480
You have oak.

00:31:01.280 --> 00:31:03.570
It's telling you something.

00:31:03.570 --> 00:31:09.490
So what I did-- I just followed
my ideas and my palate.

00:31:09.490 --> 00:31:11.690
I moved different barrels.

00:31:11.690 --> 00:31:15.670
And instead of having
the juniper as everyone

00:31:15.670 --> 00:31:19.100
has at the end of
all these barrels,

00:31:19.100 --> 00:31:23.730
I move the juniper in the middle
and the cherry at the end.

00:31:23.730 --> 00:31:30.360
So I got this fresh and balanced
flavor that is just, to me,

00:31:30.360 --> 00:31:31.960
is just perfect like that.

00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:35.330
And, you know, I got the gold
medal, so they [INAUDIBLE].

00:31:37.610 --> 00:31:40.989
It was a blind tasting, so
no one can say anything.

00:31:40.989 --> 00:31:42.780
AUDIENCE: What do you
cook for your family?

00:31:44.401 --> 00:31:45.650
MASSIMO BOTTURA: I never cook.

00:31:46.890 --> 00:31:47.390
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:47.390 --> 00:31:47.890
No.

00:31:48.930 --> 00:31:51.560
We are very lucky that
we have the opportunity

00:31:51.560 --> 00:31:54.520
to have incredible ingredients.

00:31:54.520 --> 00:31:58.430
And another thing that my
wife-- she's from New York.

00:31:58.430 --> 00:32:01.430
So she arrived in Modena,
and the first thing

00:32:01.430 --> 00:32:03.612
she did-- she went
to my mom and learned

00:32:03.612 --> 00:32:05.320
how to make ragu, how
to make passatelli.

00:32:07.120 --> 00:32:10.210
So she's very good
at cooking, and she's

00:32:10.210 --> 00:32:13.790
the one who cooks for the
children and for the family.

00:32:13.790 --> 00:32:15.560
But also ingredients, you know?

00:32:15.560 --> 00:32:18.720
When you have a
great ingredient,

00:32:18.720 --> 00:32:21.700
like the perfect burrata,
or the mozzarella

00:32:21.700 --> 00:32:24.910
that when you break it,
all the milk is coming out,

00:32:24.910 --> 00:32:26.800
and it's amazing.

00:32:26.800 --> 00:32:31.923
Or like ham, or these
sweet anchovies.

00:32:31.923 --> 00:32:33.190
You know?

00:32:33.190 --> 00:32:35.190
Put together everything and--

00:32:35.190 --> 00:32:35.837
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:35.837 --> 00:32:37.670
FEMALE SPEAKER: Please
join me one more time

00:32:37.670 --> 00:32:39.140

00:32:39.140 --> 00:32:40.340
MASSIMO BOTTURA: [INAUDIBLE].

00:32:40.340 --> 00:32:40.840

00:32:40.840 --> 00:32:44.590
