- Bladesmiths, this

00:00:02.752 --> 00:00:04.838
the fuel can stab.

00:00:04.838 --> 00:00:08.133
I'm gonna use your knives to
stab holes in these fuel cans

00:00:08.133 --> 00:00:09.759
five times.

00:00:09.759 --> 00:00:11.720
Remember, it's not what your
knives do to the fuel cans

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:14.472
but what the fuel cans
do to your knives.

00:00:14.472 --> 00:00:16.057
Raleigh and Kelly,
you're up first.

00:00:16.057 --> 00:00:17.142
Are you ready?
- Yes, sir.

00:00:17.142 --> 00:00:18.518
Yes.

00:00:18.518 --> 00:00:19.602
We're really excited
for the toughness test.

00:00:19.602 --> 00:00:20.895
We fixed that point on it.

00:00:20.895 --> 00:00:22.439
It's definitely stabbier.

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:23.857
And we're really excited
to see what's gonna happen.

00:00:40.039 --> 00:00:41.958
Raleigh, Kelly,
this is quite a knife.

00:00:41.958 --> 00:00:45.211
It's got a nice point
for penetration.

00:00:45.211 --> 00:00:49.716
But there's some chipping here.

00:00:49.716 --> 00:00:53.470
The very point is still as sharp
as it was when you made it.

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:56.931
But there's no denying that was
a little chip on the edge here.

00:00:56.931 --> 00:00:58.725
Joe, Casey you guys are up.
You ready?

00:00:58.725 --> 00:00:59.559
Oh, yeah.

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:01.186
Let's do it.

00:01:01.186 --> 00:01:02.645
CASEY: This is what me and
Joe live for, making knives

00:01:02.645 --> 00:01:04.230
is testing them to destruction.

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:05.940
JOE: What's the use of
makin' somethin' if you can't

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:07.150
find out where it's limits are?

00:01:21.915 --> 00:01:24.667
Well, Joe, Casey, your
edge held up perfectly.

00:01:24.667 --> 00:01:26.628
But this handle hurts.

00:01:26.628 --> 00:01:30.173
What I ended up with was a
position that made my pinky

00:01:30.173 --> 00:01:31.841
take a lot of the force.

00:01:31.841 --> 00:01:33.927
The holes just needed to be
closer together and a little

00:01:33.927 --> 00:01:36.930
taller.
But that edge, it's perfect.

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.431
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

00:01:38.431 --> 00:01:40.183
Mark, Jessica, you ready?

00:01:40.183 --> 00:01:41.768
Indeed.

00:01:41.768 --> 00:01:43.686
Ben's ready to test our blade.

00:01:43.686 --> 00:01:46.022
We know we've got that
cracking in there, something

00:01:46.022 --> 00:01:47.982
that we did not address.

00:01:47.982 --> 00:01:49.192
It's to the gods now.

Well, Mark, Jessica, your
edge held up beautifully.

00:02:07.085 --> 00:02:09.963
And those surface cracks we
saw in round one held together.

00:02:09.963 --> 00:02:11.673
Well done on the handle.

00:02:11.673 --> 00:02:13.049
This is the only one that I
could get my hand all the way

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:15.802
in and hold it with strength.

00:02:15.802 --> 00:02:18.096
And it allowed me to
penetrate very deeply.

00:02:18.096 --> 00:02:19.472
Overall, very well done.

00:02:19.472 --> 00:02:20.682
That's quite a trench knife.

DAVID BAKER: All
right, bladesmiths,

00:02:21.933 --> 00:02:23.643
to test the sharpness
of your blade,

00:02:23.643 --> 00:02:26.020
this is all about with your
blades due to these fire hoses.

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:27.438
Raleigh, Kelly you ready?

00:02:27.438 --> 00:02:28.565
Yes, sir.

All right, Raleigh, Kelly,
you made a sharp knife.

00:02:43.872 --> 00:02:45.623
There was no resis--
well, I can't

00:02:45.623 --> 00:02:49.085
say there was no resistance by
the mark on my little finger

00:02:49.085 --> 00:02:50.461
right there.

00:02:50.461 --> 00:02:52.755
My little finger is
being pushed so far back

00:02:52.755 --> 00:02:54.424
by that webbing right there.

00:02:54.424 --> 00:02:56.968
If that were a little
bit further forward,

00:02:56.968 --> 00:03:00.096
it might actually be
almost comfortable.

00:03:00.096 --> 00:03:01.222
All right, Joe,
Casey, you're up.

00:03:01.222 --> 00:03:02.307
You ready?
- Oh, yeah.

00:03:02.307 --> 00:03:03.391
Let's do it.
DAVID BAKER: OK.

Thanks.

DAVID BAKER: Joe, Casey,
beautiful, sharp edge.

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.198
I love the look of this.

00:03:19.198 --> 00:03:22.243
That little finger is murder.

00:03:22.243 --> 00:03:24.037
Man, I wish you had
spent a little bit more

00:03:24.037 --> 00:03:27.582
time grinding out that ring.

00:03:27.582 --> 00:03:29.125
All right, Mark,
Jessica, you ready.

00:03:29.125 --> 00:03:30.209
Yes.
Indeed.

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:32.712

00:03:35.757 --> 00:03:38.217

- Oof.

00:03:38.217 --> 00:03:40.178
Oh.

00:03:40.178 --> 00:03:42.847
That is incredibly sharp.

00:03:42.847 --> 00:03:46.434
I actually was through the hose
before I realized I'd hit it.

00:03:46.434 --> 00:03:48.061
And those surface
cracks haven't opened up

00:03:48.061 --> 00:03:50.563
or affected the performance
of your blade at all.

00:03:50.563 --> 00:03:51.689
Let's get to your handle.

00:03:51.689 --> 00:03:54.025
I can adjust this anyway I want.

00:03:54.025 --> 00:03:55.234
The finger holes are big enough.

00:03:55.234 --> 00:03:56.569
There's height in them.

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:57.487

- Thank you so much.

a final decision.

teams to leave The Forge.

Raleigh, Kelly, you guys
brought so much energy and fun.

It's not an easy challenge.

But at the end of
the day, there's

00:04:26.599 --> 00:04:31.020
only one blade here that hurt
the user and took edge damage.

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:34.148
It's for this reason
your team is gone home.

WIL WILLIS: Kelly, Raleigh,
please surrender your blade.

00:04:38.236 --> 00:04:39.862
I don't like it.

I don't like it when I don't
know how to do somethin'.

I'm goin' home.

of them trench knives.

And I'm gonna be, like, the
queen trench knife maker?

What do ya think, Kel?

00:04:48.413 --> 00:04:51.165

to work on regular knives.
