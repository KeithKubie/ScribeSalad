00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.540
So, my name is Kelly Chen, I consider myself a Bay

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:07.850
Area native. I grew up on Freemont and, I'm a Genetic

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:12.000
Counselor. And, technically, I guess my title is Perinatal Genetic Counselor.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.980
So I focus on patients who are pregnant, or thinking about pregnancy.

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:19.112
&gt;&gt; So walk us through wa, what is it like? I mean, who, what kind of patient

00:00:19.112 --> 00:00:21.470
comes to you, and how does the workflow

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:24.900
process work, when they seek out a genetic counselor?

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:25.920
&gt;&gt; So the

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.962
workflow for a perinatal genetic counselor, and perinatal

00:00:28.962 --> 00:00:31.530
is actually, kind of a new phrase we created

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:35.168
at where I work. Traditionally the word has been

00:00:35.168 --> 00:00:39.050
prenatal, so before birth, and then there's postnatal. And

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:41.460
now that we are doing so much intervention

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.870
before birth that affects after birth, we use the

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:47.540
combination of perinatal. So most of the patients that

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:51.070
I see, are pregnant actively pregnant, and thinking about

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:53.890
doing some testing, to check for either genetic conditions

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:57.640
or birth defects. sometimes we see patients before they get

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:01.500
pregnant, but they know they want to have children, and know

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.850
that they might be at risk for a certain condition.

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:08.030
So our appointments are fairly, they're like office consultations.

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:10.650
We do a little prep work, we might contact them

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.800
on the phone, and get a little family history, or

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:16.630
medical history. and then our meeting with them is probably,

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:21.710
40 minutes, 40 to 60 minutes long. and then afterwards, if we've ordered testing

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:23.120
or there's other appointments to make, we'll

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:24.830
follow up and, and help patients with that.

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:27.310
&gt;&gt; I'm really curious about the, the testing. So

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:29.170
do patients come to you and say, I want

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:33.300
to know what's in my genes, or what I pass on, and you guys do a test for them?

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.020
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so I think our patients are a

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.410
little biased. I mean, I'm sure there, it seems

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:40.340
like there, there are certainly patients out there, who

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:41.770
would say, or people out there who would say,

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:44.350
that they don't want to learn, know their genetic status.

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:46.870
And those patients we never end up seeing, because they would

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:50.150
just decline an appointment with us. So those that we do

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:53.470
see, definitely are interested in some kind of genetic information. Whether

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:56.790
it's for themselves or primarily, for their pregnancy or for their

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.655
future child. so yeah, so sometimes there's something specific in the

00:02:01.655 --> 00:02:04.440
family that we're looking for. We've had some patients just say,

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.010
test me for everything. I want to know everything, and we

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:09.880
have to explain. Are the science, science and technology's

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.530
not quite there yet and so, we're trying to pinpoint

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.420
what can we offer you. Accurate testing, specific testing, something

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.540
that would be helpful to you. So a lot of

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.360
what I do is, I think of it as a

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.064
consultation, but also just providing information. I see us as

00:02:25.064 --> 00:02:29.980
a link, between physicians and patients. That, traditionally doctors ordered

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:33.190
tests that are fairly straightforward, like a blood count, or

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:35.370
a blood type, or something like that, and they can

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.180
easily tell patient what that means in a sentence. With this

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.870
genetic testing, it's much more complicated than that. it's not

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.790
always a straightforward yes or no, and doctors don't have time

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.200
to spend with patients explaining that. And so I see

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.850
us as a bridge between that, being able to help patients

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:54.220
decipher and interpret this information, and then also helping them

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.440
make decisions based on those results. because a lot of decisions

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.960
to be made, especially in pregnancy, are not always

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:04.290
medical decisions, they're personal decisions about what patients want to

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:09.410
do about information about their future offspring. so, so prenatal

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:12.350
specifically, is an interesting ethical realm, because we're also dealing.

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.440
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.940
&gt;&gt; With pregnancy and, and termination.

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:18.250
&gt;&gt; What's the most difficult aspect about it, if I can ask? is it?

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:20.220
Is it patients actually, you know, deciding

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:24.350
about, you know, continuing the pregnancy versus not?

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:28.020
are there significant traits that they have to deal with? I just, I'm

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:30.650
looking for some kind of idea when it does, when it does get gray.

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:31.180
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:32.890
&gt;&gt; As far as the difficult part of the job.

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:35.390
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So yeah, no, you bring up a good point, I actually hadn't

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:38.490
thought about that before. And one of the difficulties in the job, in what

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:41.430
I do with pregnancy is, we're not

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:45.150
always we're certainly talking about genetic testing.

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.260
Sometimes we're dealing with other kinds of

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.650
testing in pregnancy, like ultrasounds. So video

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.800
picture of the baby, where you see a physical problem,

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:56.330
that might be something that suggests a genetic condition like

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:00.370
Down Syndrome, or something else. And seeing the physical problem,

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:03.280
doesn't guarantee what the outcome's going to be. And so that

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:05.790
is one difficulty in prenatal, that you don't have a

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:08.080
live person in front of you to say, oh this

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:10.950
person is actually fine, maybe they have an extra finger

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:14.770
or toe, but they're otherwise healthy. In a pregnancy, you don't,

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:16.350
you don't have that baby in front of you,

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:18.950
and you can't check if there's other things going on.

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:21.980
So I think that definitely is one difficult aspect of

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:25.380
what I do, specifically. and I would just say, in

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:28.270
general, just dealing with pregnant patients is tough. Pregnancy

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:31.860
is a time limited event. So I feel like of

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:35.380
all the subspecialties in genetic counseling, prenatal is usually the

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:40.309
one most time sensitive. We're under deadlines for scheduling appointments,

00:04:40.309 --> 00:04:43.542
seeing patients, test results and just the anxiety of the

00:04:43.542 --> 00:04:47.465
patients themselves. They also have the hormone issues to deal with.

00:04:47.465 --> 00:04:47.561
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:04:47.561 --> 00:04:49.720
&gt;&gt; Its a very emotional time. So it can

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:52.320
be quite challenging, but it also can be quite satisfying.

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:55.563
&gt;&gt; So I'm, I'm also curious, what is, is there a common

00:04:55.563 --> 00:04:59.366
trait or condition that you counsel for the most? Like what is, what

00:04:59.366 --> 00:05:02.171
are the things that you either end up counseling for, or do people

00:05:02.171 --> 00:05:05.570
come to you and ask the most? What are they most interested in?

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:09.610
&gt;&gt; So, for my specific specialty in prenatal, by

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:12.480
far I think nationwide the most common condition that we're

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:16.150
talking about, is Down Syndrome. I was thinking about

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:18.520
how I'd explain why. I think it's a combination of

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:20.840
things, because the condition is genetic, but it's not

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:25.780
inherited. so it would randomly appear, and there would be

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:27.690
no other way to tell about it, other than to

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:30.610
check for it in that pregnancy. And there's a known

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:32.960
association with the age of the mom, as women

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:36.060
get older, there's a higher chance of Down Syndrome.

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:38.650
the insurances actually will cover testing for Down Syndrome,

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:43.960
so that's kind of a supportive step that aids us

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:47.200
in seeing patients. It's common, a common condition, I

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:50.450
think about one in 800 to 1,000 births for

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:53.040
Down Syndrome occur, and it can be a long

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:56.460
term disability. Children with Down Syndrome grow up into adults,

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:58.980
they have intellectual disability, they can have health

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:02.630
issues. And so, it seems like there's enough interest

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:04.980
in that, that we have this testing. So for

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:09.310
my specialty, it's fairly easy. We, we talk primarily

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:12.910
about that, and some related conditions. whereas in

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:16.540
other specialties like Pediatrics, where I used to work

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:18.700
it could be a range of things variety of

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:21.640
things, depending on what a child comes in for,

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:24.295
for us to see. Whether it's a learning problem,

00:06:24.295 --> 00:06:26.640
we think about, would make us think about certain conditions

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:29.280
verses if it was a physical birth defect, like

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:31.600
a heart defect or cleft lip, that would shift our

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:35.685
gear into something else. What's the most difficult trait

00:06:35.685 --> 00:06:37.870
you've had to counsel? Is it Down Syndrome, or is

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:41.273
there another more difficult situation or trait that you've had

00:06:41.273 --> 00:06:43.940
to lets say counsel a family on, or a couple?

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:46.710
&gt;&gt; I mean one of my most memorable patient

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:49.110
cases had to, not to do with the prenatal

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:51.720
case, but a pediatric case, where we're seeing a

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:55.840
child, and part of the list of conditions we're

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:58.950
thinking about, was Taysacs Disease. So that one is

00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:02.700
also a known single gene recessive condition, that is

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:07.270
common in people with Jewish background. So when we

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:09.170
are thinking about that disease, that usually means that

00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:12.070
the child is coming in with delays, and maybe normal

00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:16.014
development, then loss of delays. so it's not like it

00:07:16.014 --> 00:07:18.431
was, it's a surprise to the family. We, we would

00:07:18.431 --> 00:07:20.879
talk to them about, this is a possibility, we're going

00:07:20.879 --> 00:07:24.345
to be ordering test for this condition. but it's always

00:07:24.345 --> 00:07:26.713
hard to have to call or contact a family, and

00:07:26.713 --> 00:07:29.420
tell them, this is, this is a condition. So I

00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:32.960
think any kind of test result that confirms a condition,

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:38.610
that It has high risk for complications, or early death that's

00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:39.580
never easy to.

00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:41.000
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.040
&gt;&gt; To, to convey.

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:44.450
&gt;&gt; So do families really have all this information?

00:07:44.450 --> 00:07:46.644
Like, are you able to build like, these massive pedigrees?

00:07:46.644 --> 00:07:46.841
[LAUGH]

00:07:46.841 --> 00:07:48.813
&gt;&gt; Or do you end up building these sort

00:07:48.813 --> 00:07:52.469
of more like, just maybe two or three generations pedigrees?

00:07:52.469 --> 00:07:55.500
&gt;&gt; So, families vary in how much information

00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:57.680
they can give us for pedigrees. I see

00:07:57.680 --> 00:07:58.790
a lot of patients, also, that I should

00:07:58.790 --> 00:08:02.770
mention, that come from other countries, especi, specifically Asia,

00:08:02.770 --> 00:08:04.940
where, not as, not much is known about

00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:07.230
family members. People don't talk about conditions in

00:08:07.230 --> 00:08:09.690
the family. So the ped, and, and people

00:08:09.690 --> 00:08:11.970
don't have that many children, so the pedigrees can

00:08:11.970 --> 00:08:14.970
be very sparse. So just like a circle, and

00:08:14.970 --> 00:08:16.870
a square, and a circle, and a square, and that's

00:08:16.870 --> 00:08:20.320
it. And then all the way to families who have

00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:22.940
their whole genealogy trees mapped out, with the aid of

00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:26.030
all these online tools, and so they come in with

00:08:26.030 --> 00:08:29.700
their pedigrees already drawn. So it's really a fun part

00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:33.100
of our drob, job, but it's also efficient to draw

00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:35.280
this out instead of trying to describe all these people.

00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:37.340
&gt;&gt; Well I have a really interesting question.

00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:37.630
&gt;&gt; Mm.

00:08:37.630 --> 00:08:39.340
&gt;&gt; To ask for all of our students,

00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:41.429
who might be struggling with pedigrees out there.

00:08:41.429 --> 00:08:41.490
&gt;&gt; Hm.

00:08:41.490 --> 00:08:43.860
&gt;&gt; How do you as an actual genetic counsel, let's

00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:46.000
say you're studying a trait. How do you distinguish when

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.320
you're looking at traits that, a recessive or dominant trait,

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:52.100
and put it in context of what you think's going on?

00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:54.550
&gt;&gt; So, the so, trying to figure out a

00:08:54.550 --> 00:08:57.490
trait, whether it's dominant, recessive, or vera-axeling, those are

00:08:57.490 --> 00:08:59.940
the top three modes of inheritance, that we're looking

00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:03.060
at. We actually have a term called pedigree analysis.

00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:06.590
and, you know, it's a subjective thing, but it

00:09:06.590 --> 00:09:09.400
really is looking at the pedigree and going through, kind

00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:12.120
of, all the rules of what dominant inheritance looks

00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:15.500
like, what recessive inheritance looks like. So if you see

00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:18.150
a trait that happens in a grandparent, a parent,

00:09:18.150 --> 00:09:20.830
and a child, then that's much more likely to be

00:09:20.830 --> 00:09:25.040
a dominant trait. If you see a condition where multiple

00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:29.250
brothers and sisters are affected and by, chance maybe their

00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:32.770
parents are related to each other, and no one else in the family

00:09:32.770 --> 00:09:35.080
has the trait. Then that's more likely

00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:37.490
or suggestive of something recessive. And then

00:09:37.490 --> 00:09:42.600
if you see, only boys affected through moms, that could be more X-linked.

00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:46.600
So the pedigree really does help us try to figure out modes of inheritance.

00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:47.720
&gt;&gt; Thank you so much.

00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:49.350
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much for the opportunity.
