00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:04.200
Like the concept of the mole,
balancing equations is one of

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.700
those ideas that you learn in
first-year chemistry class.

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:09.250
It tends to give a lot of
students a hard time, even

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:12.430
though it is a fairly
straightforward concept.

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:13.970
I think what makes it difficult
is that there's a

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:15.350
bit of an art to it.

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:17.790
So before we talk about
balancing chemical equations,

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:18.920
what is a chemical equation?

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:20.660
Well here's some examples right
here, and I have some

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:22.180
more in the rest
of this video.

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:24.750
But it essentially just
describes a chemical reaction.

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:25.720
You've got some aluminum.

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:30.600
You have some oxygen gas or a
diatomic oxygen molecule.

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.860
And then you end up with
aluminum oxide.

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:34.850
And you would say, ok, fine,
that's an equation.

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:35.830
It looks nice.

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:38.700
I have my reactants, or
the things that react.

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.240
These are the reactants.

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:42.510
And then I have the products
of this reaction.

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.090
What's left there to do?

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:45.400
Well you have a problem here.

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.770
The way I've written it right
now, I have one atom of

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:51.550
aluminum plus two atoms
of oxygen, right?

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:53.700
They're bonded to each other,
but there's two atoms of

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:54.250
oxygen here.

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:59.270
One molecule of diatomic oxygen,
or one molecule of

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:01.540
oxygen, but they have two
oxygen atoms here.

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:05.030
And when you add them together,
I have two atoms of

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:07.020
aluminum and three
atoms of oxygen.

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.550
So I have a different number of
aluminums on both sides of

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:10.510
this equation.

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:12.470
On this side, I have
one aluminum.

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:14.810
On this side, I have two
aluminums. And then I have a

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:15.850
different number of oxygens.

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:17.580
On this side, I have
two oxygens.

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.360
And on that side, I have
three oxygens.

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.700
So balancing equations is all
about fixing that problem, so

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.990
that I have the same number of
aluminum on both sides of the

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.245
equation, and the same number
of oxygens on both sides.

00:01:28.245 --> 00:01:30.200
So let's try to do that.

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:31.960
I'll do it in orange.

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.100
So I said I have one aluminum
here and I have

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.600
two aluminums there.

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.130
So maybe a simple thing is just
to put a two out here.

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:42.990
So now I have two aluminums on
this side and I have two

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.290
aluminums on this side.

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:45.400
The aluminums look happy.

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.060
Now let's look at the oxygen.

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.880
Here I have two oxygens on the

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.080
left-hand side of the equation.

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:52.900
And on the right-hand
side of the equation

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:54.280
I have three oxygens.

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:55.560
What can I do here?

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.960
Well if I could kind of have
half atoms, I could just

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.840
multiply this by
one and a half.

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.910
1.5.

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:06.190
1.5 times 2 is 3.

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:09.600
So now I have three oxygens on
both sides of this equation

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.180
and I have two aluminums on both
sides of the equation.

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.210
Am I done?

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:15.940
Well, no, you can't have half
an atom, or one and

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:17.130
a half of an atom.

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:18.270
That's not cool.

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:20.480
So what you do is you just
multiply this so that you end

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:21.145
up with whole numbers.

00:02:21.145 --> 00:02:23.230
So let's just multiply
both sides of this

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.070
whole equation by two.

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:37.700
And we have four aluminums plus
three oxygens yields-- we

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.210
multiplied everything
by two-- two

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:45.090
molecules of aluminum oxide.

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.780
Now, you might have been tempted
at some point in this

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.950
exercise to say, oh, well why
don't I just tweak part of the

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:51.860
aluminum oxide?

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:54.940
Why don't I put a 2/3 in
front of this oxygen.

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:56.640
You cannot do that.

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.380
The equation is as it is.

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.720
The molecule aluminum oxide
is aluminum oxide.

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.630
You can't change the relative
ratios of the aluminum and the

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:07.310
oxygen within the aluminum
oxide molecule.

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:11.320
You can just change the number
of aluminum oxide molecules as

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.460
a whole that you have,
in this case, two.

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:14.000
So what did we do?

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.800
We looked at the aluminum.

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.060
We said, OK, we need two
aluminums to have both sides

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:18.660
of that be two.

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.550
And then when we looked at
oxygen, we said, well, if I

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:23.310
multiply this by one and a half,
then that becomes three

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.340
oxygens here, because one and
a half times two oxygens.

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:27.880
And three oxygens there.

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.400
And then all we said is, oh, I
can't have a one half there,

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.540
so let me multiply both
sides by two.

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:37.360
And I ended up with four
aluminums plus three oxygen

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:41.980
molecules, or six oxygen atoms,
yields two molecules of

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:43.660
aluminum oxide.

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:46.070
Let's see if we can do
some more of these.

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:48.270
So here I have methane.

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:50.200
And that g in parentheses,
I just wanted to

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:50.930
expose you to that.

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:53.390
That just means it's a gas.

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:58.340
So I have methane gas plus
oxygen gas yields carbon

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:00.090
dioxide gas plus water.

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:02.410
That's an l there,
so liquid water.

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:04.640
So what can we do here?

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:07.440
So the general thing is, do
the complicated molecules

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:11.140
first, and then at the end you
can worry about the single

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:13.000
atom molecules.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.180
Because those are very
easy to play with.

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.139
And the reason why you do that,
whenever you change a

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:19.680
number here-- let's say we're
trying to engineer how many

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.680
carbons we have on both sides of
this equation-- if I set a

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:24.680
number here, I'm also changing
the number of hydrogens.

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:26.140
Then I'll have to play with
the hydrogens there.

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:28.720
And at the end, I'll have
some number of oxygens.

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.630
And then I have to tweak this
number right there.

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:33.770
So let's just start
with the carbons.

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:36.050
It seems complicated, but when
you go step by step and you

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:38.100
kind of play with things a
little bit, it should proceed

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:39.550
fairly smoothly.

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:41.070
So here I have two carbons.

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:45.790
And here I have, on
the right-hand

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:47.810
side, only one carbon.

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:49.790
So ideally I'd want two
carbons on both

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:50.780
sides of this equation.

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:53.930
So let me put a two out here.

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:55.700
So there you go, my
carbons are happy.

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:58.460
I now have two carbons
and two carbons.

00:04:58.460 --> 00:04:59.850
Now let me move to
the hydrogens.

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:02.010
Remember, I wanted to do the
oxygens last, because I can

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:05.000
just set this to whatever I want
it to be without messing

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.070
up any of the other atoms. So on
this side of the equation I

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:11.370
have four hydrogen atoms. How
many hydrogen atoms do I have

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:12.690
on this side of the equation?

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:16.320
So I have four hydrogen
atoms here.

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:18.150
How many do I have
on this side?

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:21.070
Well, I have two hydrogen
atoms right there.

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:24.100
So I want to have four on both
sides, so let me put a two in

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:25.510
front of the water.

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:29.310
So now I have four hydrogen
atoms. Cool.

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:30.850
Finally, oxygen.

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:35.800
On the left-hand side I have two
oxygen atoms. And on the

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:37.780
right-hand side,
what do I have?

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:41.970
I have two times this one
oxygen, right here, so right

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:44.290
now that's two, right?

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:44.980
Two waters.

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:49.450
And in each water I have one
oxygen atom, but I have two

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:52.170
water molecules, so I
have two oxygens.

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:56.270
And then in the carbon dioxide
I have two oxygens in each

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:56.845
carbon dioxide.

00:05:56.845 --> 00:05:58.950
And I have two carbon
dioxides, right?

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:01.290
When I put that magenta
two out front.

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:02.560
So how many oxygens do I have?

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:03.420
Two times two.

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:05.330
I have four oxygens.

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:07.820
So on the left-hand side
I have two oxygens.

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:11.020
On the right-hand side I have
six oxygens, two in the two

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:13.430
molecules of water and
four in the two

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:15.770
molecules of carbon dioxide.

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:18.460
So how do I make this
two into six?

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:20.410
I want to have six oxygens
on this side.

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:21.690
I want to them to have
six oxygens on the

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:22.855
left-hand side as well.

00:06:22.855 --> 00:06:30.110
Well, if I put a three out here,
now I have six oxygens.

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:31.810
And our equation has
been balanced.

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:35.210
I have two carbons on this
side, two carbons on that

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:38.780
side, four hydrogens on this
side, four hydrogens on this

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:42.040
side, six oxygens on this side,
and then-- four plus

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:44.810
two-- six oxygens
on that side.

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:46.840
Next equation to balance.

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:49.270
This actually becomes quite
fun once you get

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:51.320
the knack of it.

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:58.510
So I have ethane plus
oxygen gas yielding

00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:00.575
carbon dioxide and water.

00:07:00.575 --> 00:07:03.230
So this is a combustion
process.

00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:05.280
Let's look at the
carbons first. I

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:06.810
have two carbons here.

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:09.010
I have one carbon there.

00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:11.050
So let me put a two here.

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:13.240
So now I have two carbons.

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:14.090
Fair enough.

00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:15.900
Remember, I'm going to worry
about the oxygen last. This

00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:16.910
one's actually not
too different

00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:18.420
than the last problem.

00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:21.130
I have six hydrogens here.

00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:23.400
I only have two hydrogens
in the water.

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:28.090
So then we have three
water molecules.

00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:30.470
And now I've balanced
out the hydrogens.

00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:33.520
I have six hydrogens on both
sides of the equation.

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:36.060
And now let's deal
with the water.

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:40.330
Here on the right-hand side--
I'll do it in this orange

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:45.590
color-- I have two oxygens in
each carbon dioxide molecule.

00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:48.780
And I have two molecules,
so I have four oxygens.

00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:52.230
And I have one oxygen in
each water molecule.

00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:56.240
And I have three molecules, so
I have three oxygens here.

00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:57.580
Is that right?

00:07:57.580 --> 00:08:00.190
Three oxygens on the
right-hand side.

00:08:00.190 --> 00:08:02.060
Yep, three water molecules.

00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:07.200
And then I have four oxygens
in the carbon dioxide.

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:07.860
Right.

00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:09.790
So I have seven oxygens.

00:08:09.790 --> 00:08:11.590
I have seven oxygens on
this side and I only

00:08:11.590 --> 00:08:13.130
have two on this side.

00:08:13.130 --> 00:08:15.575
So how can I make this
two into seven.

00:08:15.575 --> 00:08:19.360
Well I could multiply it
by three and a half.

00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:19.690
Right?

00:08:19.690 --> 00:08:21.620
Remember, I just want to have
seven on both sides.

00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:25.290
If I have three and a half
of these diatomic oxygen

00:08:25.290 --> 00:08:27.640
molecules-- three and a half
times two is seven-- so now I

00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:30.830
have seven oxygens on both
sides of the equation.

00:08:30.830 --> 00:08:32.870
Four plus three and
seven here.

00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:34.059
Two carbons.

00:08:34.059 --> 00:08:35.820
And then six hydrogens.

00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:38.429
And I'm almost done, except for
the fact that you can't

00:08:38.429 --> 00:08:40.559
have fractions of molecules.

00:08:40.559 --> 00:08:42.409
So what you do is just multiply
both sides of this

00:08:42.409 --> 00:08:45.760
equation by two or three, or
whatever you need to multiply

00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:46.960
it to get rid of
the fractions.

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:50.800
So if I multiply everything
by two, I end up with two

00:08:50.800 --> 00:09:00.580
molecules of ethane plus seven
molecules of diatomic oxygen,

00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:07.520
seven O2's, yielding two
molecules of carbon dioxide--

00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:10.200
oh, sorry, I'm multiplying
everything by two, so four

00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:18.920
molecules of carbon dioxide,
plus six molecules of water.

00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:21.600
And just to make sure that all
still works, if you want to,

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:22.630
you can check.

00:09:22.630 --> 00:09:23.830
How much carbon do we have?

00:09:23.830 --> 00:09:25.980
I have four carbons here.

00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:28.180
I have four carbons here.

00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:29.520
How much hydrogen do I have?

00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:31.420
I have two times six.

00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:33.630
I have 12 hydrogens here.

00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:36.100
I have 12 hydrogens here.

00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:37.640
How much oxygen do I have?

00:09:40.150 --> 00:09:41.420
Let me do a different color.

00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:44.190
I have 14 oxygens here.

00:09:44.190 --> 00:09:48.040
And here I have eight oxygens.

00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:50.860
And here I have-- six times
one-- six oxygens.

00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:53.010
So six plus eight is 14.

00:09:53.010 --> 00:09:56.000
So my equation has
been balanced.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.230
So that one, a lot of people
might find that to be a hard

00:09:58.230 --> 00:10:00.260
problem, because you have three
and a half, and just

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:02.130
going straight to this might
seem non-intuitive.

00:10:02.130 --> 00:10:05.660
But if you just work from the
more complicated molecules and

00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:07.980
you go atom by atom, and if you
end up with any fractions

00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:10.775
you just multiply both sides by
some number to get rid of

00:10:10.775 --> 00:10:13.030
the fraction, of and
then you're done.

00:10:13.030 --> 00:10:13.590
All right.

00:10:13.590 --> 00:10:15.850
Let's do another one.

00:10:15.850 --> 00:10:17.950
So this one looks all hairy.

00:10:17.950 --> 00:10:24.190
I have this iron oxide plus
sulfuric acid yields all this

00:10:24.190 --> 00:10:25.260
hairy stuff.

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:30.000
But the key here to realize is
that this group right here,

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:35.170
this sulfate group,
stays together.

00:10:35.170 --> 00:10:35.480
Right?

00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:39.580
You have this SO4 there and
you have this SO4 there.

00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:42.740
So to really simplify things for
our head, you can kind of

00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:44.010
treat that like an atom.

00:10:44.010 --> 00:10:45.410
So let's make a substitution.

00:10:45.410 --> 00:10:48.230
We'll substitute that for x.

00:10:48.230 --> 00:10:52.230
So if we rewrite this as--
I'll do it in a vibrant

00:10:52.230 --> 00:11:03.390
color-- iron oxide plus H2--
there's only one sulfate

00:11:03.390 --> 00:11:07.690
group here-- x.

00:11:07.690 --> 00:11:15.070
And then that yields
two irons, this

00:11:15.070 --> 00:11:15.940
molecule with two irons.

00:11:15.940 --> 00:11:18.070
And it has three of these
sulfate groups.

00:11:21.140 --> 00:11:22.390
And then plus water.

00:11:26.450 --> 00:11:28.870
All I did is replace the
sulfate with an x.

00:11:28.870 --> 00:11:32.040
And now we can treat that x like
an atom, and we can just

00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:33.830
balance the equation.

00:11:33.830 --> 00:11:36.040
Let's see, on the left-hand
side, how

00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:37.300
many irons do we have?

00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:39.000
We have two irons here.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:40.820
We have two irons there.

00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:45.190
So the irons look balanced,
at first glance.

00:11:45.190 --> 00:11:47.630
Let's deal with the oxygens.

00:11:47.630 --> 00:11:52.280
So if we have three oxygens
here-- let me do it in a

00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:59.660
different color-- and we only
have one oxygen here.

00:11:59.660 --> 00:12:03.480
Remember, there were some
oxygens in this x group, but

00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:05.590
the sulfate group stayed
together, so we can just treat

00:12:05.590 --> 00:12:08.700
those separately.

00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:10.820
We want to have three oxygens
on the right-hand side, as

00:12:10.820 --> 00:12:13.250
well, so let's stick
a three here.

00:12:13.250 --> 00:12:14.500
Oops.

00:12:19.710 --> 00:12:21.040
So let me put that
three there.

00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:23.960
So now we have three
oxygens, as well.

00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:28.733
And then finally, let's
look at the hydrogens.

00:12:35.950 --> 00:12:37.160
Let's see, how many hydrogens
do we have here.

00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:41.270
We have six hydrogens now,
on the right-hand side.

00:12:41.270 --> 00:12:42.840
Six hydrogens here.

00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:43.725
Three times two.

00:12:43.725 --> 00:12:46.770
And we want to have six
hydrogens here, so we have to

00:12:46.770 --> 00:12:48.910
have three of these molecules.

00:12:48.910 --> 00:12:52.200
And then finally, let's look at
the sulfate group, that x.

00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:53.790
We have three x's here.

00:12:57.090 --> 00:13:01.350
And lucky for us, we have
three x's over there.

00:13:01.350 --> 00:13:03.420
So our equation has
been balanced.

00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:05.760
And if we want to write it back
in terms of the sulfate

00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:09.490
terms, we can just un-substitute
the x, and we're

00:13:09.490 --> 00:13:16.450
left with one molecule of iron
oxide plus three molecules of

00:13:16.450 --> 00:13:21.540
sulfuric acid, H2SO4 -- I just
un-substituted the x with SO4

00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:28.570
-- yields one of these
molecules, SO4 3.

00:13:32.270 --> 00:13:39.540
I just un-substituted the x plus
three molecules of water.

00:13:39.540 --> 00:13:40.670
Let's do one more.

00:13:40.670 --> 00:13:43.800
And then I think we'll
be all balanced out.

00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:47.750
Carbon dioxide plus hydrogen gas
yields methane plus water.

00:13:47.750 --> 00:13:51.700
So let's deal with the carbon
first. I have one carbon here,

00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:52.540
one carbon there.

00:13:52.540 --> 00:13:53.940
The carbons look happy.

00:13:53.940 --> 00:13:54.890
Let's look at the oxygen.

00:13:54.890 --> 00:13:56.920
I have two oxygens here.

00:13:56.920 --> 00:13:58.990
I have one oxygen there.

00:13:58.990 --> 00:14:02.350
So I want two oxygens here so
let me stick a two there.

00:14:02.350 --> 00:14:04.300
And then let's deal with the
hydrogens last, because this

00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:06.650
is the easiest one to play with
because it doesn't affect

00:14:06.650 --> 00:14:11.030
any of the other atoms. So if
I have two here and I have

00:14:11.030 --> 00:14:14.060
four, plus four here, right?

00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:15.865
I have four hydrogens there.

00:14:15.865 --> 00:14:18.160
And I have four hydrogens
there.

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:20.790
So I need eight hydrogens
on the left-hand side.

00:14:20.790 --> 00:14:22.440
So I just put a four there.

00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:24.350
We're all done balancing.

00:14:24.350 --> 00:14:27.260
Anyway, hopefully you
found that useful.
