what women should know so what is the

what women should know so what is the
 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:48.759
what women should know so what is the
confidence code and are you thinking

00:03:48.759 --> 00:03:48.769
confidence code and are you thinking
 

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:49.839
confidence code and are you thinking
about tomorrow from the language of

00:03:49.839 --> 00:03:49.849
about tomorrow from the language of
 

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:51.430
about tomorrow from the language of
computing are you recommending that we

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:51.440
computing are you recommending that we
 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:54.220
computing are you recommending that we
break the code or write the code well I

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:54.230
break the code or write the code well I
 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:57.520
break the code or write the code well I
think I think a little bit of both I

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:57.530
think I think a little bit of both I
 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:01.059
think I think a little bit of both I
think that we we think women need to

00:04:01.059 --> 00:04:01.069
think that we we think women need to
 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:04.449
think that we we think women need to
crack the code to learn the code because

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:04.459
crack the code to learn the code because
 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:06.339
crack the code to learn the code because
we we set out to discover whether in

00:04:06.339 --> 00:04:06.349
we we set out to discover whether in
 

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:07.690
we we set out to discover whether in
fact there is a code and we found that

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:07.700
fact there is a code and we found that
 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:09.309
fact there is a code and we found that
there are some things we can learn about

00:04:09.309 --> 00:04:09.319
there are some things we can learn about
 

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:10.809
there are some things we can learn about
confidence and that many of us don't

00:04:10.809 --> 00:04:10.819
confidence and that many of us don't
 

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:13.089
confidence and that many of us don't
know but along the way and I would say

00:04:13.089 --> 00:04:13.099
know but along the way and I would say
 

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:14.800
know but along the way and I would say
it was well into our research where we

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:14.810
it was well into our research where we
 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:17.610
it was well into our research where we
realized that the confidence may in fact

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:17.620
realized that the confidence may in fact
 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:20.650
realized that the confidence may in fact
not look the same way for everybody that

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:20.660
not look the same way for everybody that
 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:22.390
not look the same way for everybody that
there may be a way that women need to

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400
there may be a way that women need to
 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.610
there may be a way that women need to
take this code and transform it a little

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:24.620
take this code and transform it a little
 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:29.260
take this code and transform it a little
bit for ourselves so I would say both we

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:29.270
bit for ourselves so I would say both we
 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:31.090
bit for ourselves so I would say both we

called it the science and the art of
 

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:33.010
called it the science and the art of
self assurance because confidence is

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:33.020
self assurance because confidence is
 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:35.290
self assurance because confidence is
part science we discovered it is partly

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:35.300
part science we discovered it is partly

lot of very interesting data there but

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:45.600
lot of very interesting data there but
 

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:47.000
lot of very interesting data there but
there was one piece of the puzzle that

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:47.010
there was one piece of the puzzle that
 

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:50.240
there was one piece of the puzzle that
we walked away with and we hadn't really

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:50.250
we walked away with and we hadn't really
 

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:51.620
we walked away with and we hadn't really
been able to address it in the book and

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:51.630
been able to address it in the book and
 

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:53.930
been able to address it in the book and
that was the fact that so many of the

that was the fact that so many of the
 

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:58.100
that was the fact that so many of the
most successful articulate smart

I went so we stood we thought what is

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:28.110
I went so we stood we thought what is
 

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:29.930
I went so we stood we thought what is
this just something women talk about or

this just something women talk about or
 

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:31.940
this just something women talk about or
is there data and we were frankly

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:31.950
is there data and we were frankly
 

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:34.880
is there data and we were frankly
surprised to find that there is a lot of

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:34.890
surprised to find that there is a lot of
 

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:36.830
surprised to find that there is a lot of
data yeah it's pretty compelling the

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:36.840
data yeah it's pretty compelling the
 

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:39.080
data yeah it's pretty compelling the
evidence that there is a gap in

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:39.090
evidence that there is a gap in
 

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:39.980

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:53.320
said he the way he views it he tried to
just boil it down to the most basic

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:53.330
just boil it down to the most basic
 

00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:55.420
just boil it down to the most basic
level he said his view is that

00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:55.430
level he said his view is that
 

00:07:55.430 --> 00:07:58.360
level he said his view is that
confidence should serve as a sort of

00:07:58.360 --> 00:07:58.370
confidence should serve as a sort of
 

00:07:58.370 --> 00:08:01.060
confidence should serve as a sort of
barometer or a navigation tool for our

00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:01.070
barometer or a navigation tool for our
 

00:08:01.070 --> 00:08:03.010
barometer or a navigation tool for our
lives and it should be ideally as

00:08:03.010 --> 00:08:03.020
lives and it should be ideally as
 

00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:07.840
lives and it should be ideally as
accurately tuned as possible and in law

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:07.850
accurately tuned as possible and in law
 

00:08:07.850 --> 00:08:09.640
accurately tuned as possible and in law
is in line with our abilities as

00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:09.650
is in line with our abilities as
 

00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:11.500
is in line with our abilities as
possible and what we came to see is that

00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:11.510
possible and what we came to see is that
 

00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:14.950
possible and what we came to see is that
for women is just routinely off we're

00:08:14.950 --> 00:08:14.960
for women is just routinely off we're
 

00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:17.890
for women is just routinely off we're
just not estimating our abilities

00:08:17.890 --> 00:08:17.900
just not estimating our abilities
 

00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:19.900
just not estimating our abilities
accurately most of the time and that can

00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:19.910
accurately most of the time and that can
 

00:08:19.910 --> 00:08:21.430
accurately most of the time and that can
lead you can imagine over the course of

00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:21.440
lead you can imagine over the course of
 

00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:24.220
lead you can imagine over the course of
a career if you're not if you don't

00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:24.230
a career if you're not if you don't
 

00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:25.480
a career if you're not if you don't
think you're ready for a promotion you

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:25.490
think you're ready for a promotion you
 

00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:27.220
think you're ready for a promotion you
don't think the papers are ready to be

00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:27.230
don't think the papers are ready to be
 

00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:29.830
don't think the papers are ready to be
turned in you know right exactly you're

00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:29.840
turned in you know right exactly you're
 

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:31.690
turned in you know right exactly you're
not ready you're not ready yeah yeah so

not ready you're not ready yeah yeah so
 

00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:33.010

what do you think the origins are for

00:08:33.010 --> 00:08:33.020
what do you think the origins are for
 

00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:34.270
what do you think the origins are for
the gap I mean there's the art and the

00:08:34.270 --> 00:08:34.280
the gap I mean there's the art and the
 

00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:36.100
the gap I mean there's the art and the

maybe it's our rat nature we did one we

maybe it's our rat nature we did one we
did a lot of research for this book we

did a lot of research for this book we
 

00:08:44.930 --> 00:08:47.410
did a lot of research for this book we
interviewed dozens of psychologists and

studies that we came across was one done
 

00:08:55.580 --> 00:08:57.550
studies that we came across was one done
by a professor in the University of

Zack s T's put a group of men and women

00:09:02.230 --> 00:09:02.240
Zack s T's put a group of men and women
 

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:04.270
Zack s T's put a group of men and women
in front of something called a spatial

a 3d Rubik's Cube and he asked them to

00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:09.590
a 3d Rubik's Cube and he asked them to
 

00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:12.610
a 3d Rubik's Cube and he asked them to
solve a whole load of problems he found

00:09:12.610 --> 00:09:12.620
solve a whole load of problems he found
 

00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:14.140
solve a whole load of problems he found
when he did this test that the women

00:09:14.140 --> 00:09:14.150
when he did this test that the women
 

00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:16.360
when he did this test that the women
scored much less well than the men so he

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:16.370
scored much less well than the men so he
 

00:09:16.370 --> 00:09:18.100
scored much less well than the men so he
went back over the answers and he also

00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:18.110
went back over the answers and he also
 

00:09:18.110 --> 00:09:20.170
went back over the answers and he also
found when he looked into it that what

00:09:20.170 --> 00:09:20.180
found when he looked into it that what
 

00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:21.550
found when he looked into it that what
was happening was that the women were

00:09:21.550 --> 00:09:21.560
was happening was that the women were
 

00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:24.190
was happening was that the women were
skipping questions a lot more often than

00:09:24.190 --> 00:09:24.200
skipping questions a lot more often than
 

00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:26.770
skipping questions a lot more often than
the men were he went back to the group

00:09:26.770 --> 00:09:26.780
the men were he went back to the group
 

00:09:26.780 --> 00:09:28.600
the men were he went back to the group
and he said ok no more skipping you all

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:28.610
and he said ok no more skipping you all
 

00:09:28.610 --> 00:09:30.970
and he said ok no more skipping you all
have to answer all of the questions when

00:09:30.970 --> 00:09:30.980
have to answer all of the questions when
 

00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:32.860
have to answer all of the questions when
the women had to answer all of the

00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:32.870
the women had to answer all of the
 

00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:34.870
the women had to answer all of the
questions guess what happened they did

00:09:34.870 --> 00:09:34.880
questions guess what happened they did
 

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:37.210
questions guess what happened they did
just as well as the men did they had

00:09:37.210 --> 00:09:37.220
just as well as the men did they had
 

00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:39.970
just as well as the men did they had
chosen to skip the questions because

00:09:39.970 --> 00:09:39.980
chosen to skip the questions because
 

00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:41.620
chosen to skip the questions because
they didn't want to risk getting them

00:09:41.620 --> 00:09:41.630
they didn't want to risk getting them
 

00:09:41.630 --> 00:09:46.090
they didn't want to risk getting them
wrong and to some extent that became a

00:09:46.090 --> 00:09:46.100
wrong and to some extent that became a
 

00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:48.790
wrong and to some extent that became a
metaphor for us about the confidence gap

00:09:48.790 --> 00:09:48.800
metaphor for us about the confidence gap
 

00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:51.940
metaphor for us about the confidence gap
if you skip the questions in life you

00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:51.950
if you skip the questions in life you
 

00:09:51.950 --> 00:09:53.740
if you skip the questions in life you
are not going to score as well as you

00:09:53.740 --> 00:09:53.750
are not going to score as well as you
 

00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:56.950
are not going to score as well as you
could do and when we asked Zach s T's so

00:09:56.950 --> 00:09:56.960
could do and when we asked Zach s T's so
 

00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:58.060
could do and when we asked Zach s T's so
why is this why

00:09:58.060 --> 00:09:58.070
why is this why
 

00:09:58.070 --> 00:09:59.700
why is this why
knowing that they would get lower scores

00:09:59.700 --> 00:09:59.710
knowing that they would get lower scores
 

00:09:59.710 --> 00:10:02.290
knowing that they would get lower scores
why did the women choose to skip the

00:10:02.290 --> 00:10:02.300
why did the women choose to skip the
 

00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:04.540
why did the women choose to skip the
questions he said it was that there's

00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:04.550
questions he said it was that there's
 

00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:07.030
questions he said it was that there's
this fear of failure they didn't want to

00:10:07.030 --> 00:10:07.040
this fear of failure they didn't want to
 

00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:09.640
this fear of failure they didn't want to
risk answering something that they

00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:09.650
risk answering something that they
 

00:10:09.650 --> 00:10:11.440
risk answering something that they
weren't a hundred percent sure they were

00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:11.450
weren't a hundred percent sure they were
 

00:10:11.450 --> 00:10:12.940
weren't a hundred percent sure they were
going to get right and that that

00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:12.950
going to get right and that that
 

00:10:12.950 --> 00:10:15.460
going to get right and that that
research was so critical for us because

00:10:15.460 --> 00:10:15.470
research was so critical for us because
 

00:10:15.470 --> 00:10:17.230
research was so critical for us because
it came at about the same time that we

00:10:17.230 --> 00:10:17.240
it came at about the same time that we
 

00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:19.690
it came at about the same time that we
finally literally after I think it took

00:10:19.690 --> 00:10:19.700
finally literally after I think it took
 

00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:22.210
finally literally after I think it took
us a year to define confidence okay I

00:10:22.210 --> 00:10:22.220
us a year to define confidence okay I
 

00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:24.640
us a year to define confidence okay I
don't think anybody in academia will be

00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:24.650
don't think anybody in academia will be
 

00:10:24.650 --> 00:10:26.350
don't think anybody in academia will be
surprised that when Cathy and I set out

00:10:26.350 --> 00:10:26.360
surprised that when Cathy and I set out
 

00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:28.330
surprised that when Cathy and I set out
to get a definition for confidence that

00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:28.340
to get a definition for confidence that
 

00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:32.140
to get a definition for confidence that
it wasn't that easy but when this was

00:10:32.140 --> 00:10:32.150
it wasn't that easy but when this was
 

00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:33.790
it wasn't that easy but when this was
first clusterings have a lot of

00:10:33.790 --> 00:10:33.800
first clusterings have a lot of
 

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:35.530
first clusterings have a lot of
different opinions about her beliefs the

00:10:35.530 --> 00:10:35.540
different opinions about her beliefs the
 

00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:37.930
different opinions about her beliefs the
one we walked away with in the end came

00:10:37.930 --> 00:10:37.940
one we walked away with in the end came
 

00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:39.640
one we walked away with in the end came
from a professor at Ohio State and he

00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:39.650
from a professor at Ohio State and he
 

00:10:39.650 --> 00:10:41.520
from a professor at Ohio State and he
said to us look at its most basic

00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:41.530
said to us look at its most basic
 

00:10:41.530 --> 00:10:43.780
said to us look at its most basic
confidence is the stuff that turns our

00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:43.790
confidence is the stuff that turns our
 

00:10:43.790 --> 00:10:46.570
confidence is the stuff that turns our
thoughts into action in effect it

thoughts into action in effect it

greases the wheels for action and we've

00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:49.190
greases the wheels for action and we've
 

00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:50.260
greases the wheels for action and we've
never thought about it like that I mean

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:50.270
never thought about it like that I mean
 

00:10:50.270 --> 00:10:51.640
never thought about it like that I mean
I think we thought more about confidence

00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:51.650
I think we thought more about confidence
 

00:10:51.650 --> 00:10:53.770
I think we thought more about confidence
is just a little more closely related to

00:10:53.770 --> 00:10:53.780
is just a little more closely related to
 

00:10:53.780 --> 00:10:55.630
is just a little more closely related to
self-esteem a feeling something that

00:10:55.630 --> 00:10:55.640
self-esteem a feeling something that
 

00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:57.880
self-esteem a feeling something that
makes us feel good but for women

00:10:57.880 --> 00:10:57.890
makes us feel good but for women
 

00:10:57.890 --> 00:11:00.970
makes us feel good but for women
especially that action component is very

00:11:00.970 --> 00:11:00.980
especially that action component is very
 

00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:02.800
especially that action component is very
important because as we will discuss

00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:02.810
important because as we will discuss
 

00:11:02.810 --> 00:11:04.510
important because as we will discuss
later but women are we're really good at

00:11:04.510 --> 00:11:04.520
later but women are we're really good at
 

00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:06.640
later but women are we're really good at
thinking and we think and we think and

00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:06.650
thinking and we think and we think and
 

00:11:06.650 --> 00:11:08.260
thinking and we think and we think and
we think and sometimes we overthink but

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:08.270
we think and sometimes we overthink but
 

00:11:08.270 --> 00:11:12.580
we think and sometimes we overthink but
sometimes we pause before we act and I

00:11:12.580 --> 00:11:12.590
sometimes we pause before we act and I
 

00:11:12.590 --> 00:11:14.770
sometimes we pause before we act and I
think again the skipping the questions

00:11:14.770 --> 00:11:14.780
think again the skipping the questions
 

00:11:14.780 --> 00:11:17.800
think again the skipping the questions
that tie taking risks we also found that

00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:17.810
that tie taking risks we also found that
 

00:11:17.810 --> 00:11:22.150
that tie taking risks we also found that
the action the the process of acting of

and eventually mastering something

00:11:27.310 --> 00:11:27.320
and eventually mastering something
 

00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:29.170
and eventually mastering something
that's the process that creates

00:11:29.170 --> 00:11:29.180
that's the process that creates
 

00:11:29.180 --> 00:11:31.180
that's the process that creates
confidence so it's really almost a

00:11:31.180 --> 00:11:31.190
confidence so it's really almost a
 

00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:34.600
confidence so it's really almost a
virtuous circle it gives you know you

00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:34.610
virtuous circle it gives you know you
 

00:11:34.610 --> 00:11:38.050
virtuous circle it gives you know you
act you build confidence and you know it

00:11:38.050 --> 00:11:38.060
act you build confidence and you know it

00:15:02.550 --> 00:15:04.400
let's do it
and it's totally easy to get your genes

00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:04.410
and it's totally easy to get your genes
 

00:15:04.410 --> 00:15:06.049
and it's totally easy to get your genes
tested they send you a little packet and

00:15:06.049 --> 00:15:06.059
tested they send you a little packet and
 

00:15:06.059 --> 00:15:07.790
tested they send you a little packet and
you spit into a tube and then you send

00:15:07.790 --> 00:15:07.800
you spit into a tube and then you send
 

00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:10.009
you spit into a tube and then you send
that tube off by FedEx and then you

00:15:10.009 --> 00:15:10.019
that tube off by FedEx and then you
 

00:15:10.019 --> 00:15:11.929
that tube off by FedEx and then you
spend two weeks sweating while you wait

00:15:11.929 --> 00:15:11.939
spend two weeks sweating while you wait
 

00:15:11.939 --> 00:15:13.549
spend two weeks sweating while you wait
for the results and it's a bit like

00:15:13.549 --> 00:15:13.559
for the results and it's a bit like
 

00:15:13.559 --> 00:15:15.290
for the results and it's a bit like
waiting for your SAT results but this is

00:15:15.290 --> 00:15:15.300
waiting for your SAT results but this is
 

00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:16.759
waiting for your SAT results but this is
your whole personality that's on the

00:15:16.759 --> 00:15:16.769
your whole personality that's on the
 

00:15:16.769 --> 00:15:19.160
your whole personality that's on the
line here and what happens if your genes

00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:19.170
line here and what happens if your genes
 

00:15:19.170 --> 00:15:20.269
line here and what happens if your genes
come back and they're not the genes you

00:15:20.269 --> 00:15:20.279
come back and they're not the genes you
 

00:15:20.279 --> 00:15:22.879
come back and they're not the genes you
expect it or you're not perfect which of

00:15:22.879 --> 00:15:22.889
expect it or you're not perfect which of
 

00:15:22.889 --> 00:15:24.710
expect it or you're not perfect which of
course we should have been able to

00:15:24.710 --> 00:15:24.720
course we should have been able to
 

00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:27.799
course we should have been able to
control our genes naturally and we spent

00:15:27.799 --> 00:15:27.809
control our genes naturally and we spent
 

00:15:27.809 --> 00:15:30.439
control our genes naturally and we spent
two weeks and finally the neuroscientist

00:15:30.439 --> 00:15:30.449
two weeks and finally the neuroscientist
 

00:15:30.449 --> 00:15:32.809
two weeks and finally the neuroscientist
came back with our results and neither

00:15:32.809 --> 00:15:32.819
came back with our results and neither
 

00:15:32.819 --> 00:15:34.369
came back with our results and neither
Claire nor I are predisposed to

00:15:34.369 --> 00:15:34.379
Claire nor I are predisposed to
 

00:15:34.379 --> 00:15:36.799
Claire nor I are predisposed to
confidence we're actually basket cases

00:15:36.799 --> 00:15:36.809
confidence we're actually basket cases
 

00:15:36.809 --> 00:15:39.799
confidence we're actually basket cases
pretty much on the genetic front and

00:15:39.799 --> 00:15:39.809
pretty much on the genetic front and
 

00:15:39.809 --> 00:15:41.179
pretty much on the genetic front and
we've sort of looked at each other we're

00:15:41.179 --> 00:15:41.189
we've sort of looked at each other we're
 

00:15:41.189 --> 00:15:42.410
we've sort of looked at each other we're
either puzzled and thought well what do

00:15:42.410 --> 00:15:42.420
either puzzled and thought well what do
 

00:15:42.420 --> 00:15:44.059
either puzzled and thought well what do
we do with this information in terms of

00:15:44.059 --> 00:15:44.069
we do with this information in terms of
 

00:15:44.069 --> 00:15:45.679
we do with this information in terms of
the book yeah and I think what it made

00:15:45.679 --> 00:15:45.689
the book yeah and I think what it made
 

00:15:45.689 --> 00:15:47.359
the book yeah and I think what it made
us realize was that although the numbers

00:15:47.359 --> 00:15:47.369
us realize was that although the numbers
 

00:15:47.369 --> 00:15:49.189
us realize was that although the numbers
are right that it's something like 25 to

00:15:49.189 --> 00:15:49.199
are right that it's something like 25 to
 

00:15:49.199 --> 00:15:51.980
are right that it's something like 25 to
50 percent genetic there's a whole big

00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:51.990
50 percent genetic there's a whole big
 

00:15:51.990 --> 00:15:53.660
50 percent genetic there's a whole big
chunk that isn't yes and that's what

00:15:53.660 --> 00:15:53.670
chunk that isn't yes and that's what
 

00:15:53.670 --> 00:15:55.369
chunk that isn't yes and that's what
psychologists call volitional the

00:15:55.369 --> 00:15:55.379
psychologists call volitional the
 

00:15:55.379 --> 00:15:57.319
psychologists call volitional the
choices that you make in life and Claire

00:15:57.319 --> 00:15:57.329
choices that you make in life and Claire
 

00:15:57.329 --> 00:15:59.749
choices that you make in life and Claire
and I have become confident people but

00:15:59.749 --> 00:15:59.759
and I have become confident people but
 

00:15:59.759 --> 00:16:01.939
and I have become confident people but
we've done it despite our genes we've

00:16:01.939 --> 00:16:01.949
we've done it despite our genes we've
 

00:16:01.949 --> 00:16:03.739
we've done it despite our genes we've
done it because of the confident the

00:16:03.739 --> 00:16:03.749
done it because of the confident the
 

00:16:03.749 --> 00:16:04.999
done it because of the confident the
choices that we have made that's

00:16:04.999 --> 00:16:05.009
choices that we have made that's
 

00:16:05.009 --> 00:16:06.710
choices that we have made that's
increased our to a confident right and

00:16:06.710 --> 00:16:06.720
increased our to a confident right and
 

00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:08.809
increased our to a confident right and
I'm just gonna say that and there's of

00:16:08.809 --> 00:16:08.819
I'm just gonna say that and there's of
 

00:16:08.819 --> 00:16:11.780
I'm just gonna say that and there's of
course it's it's so complex I mean the

00:16:11.780 --> 00:16:11.790
course it's it's so complex I mean the
 

00:16:11.790 --> 00:16:14.090
course it's it's so complex I mean the
interaction of society and our

00:16:14.090 --> 00:16:14.100
interaction of society and our
 

00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:16.850
interaction of society and our
upbringing in the genes and all of that

00:16:16.850 --> 00:16:16.860
upbringing in the genes and all of that
 

00:16:16.860 --> 00:16:19.280
upbringing in the genes and all of that
together and so we're boiling it down

00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:19.290
together and so we're boiling it down
 

00:16:19.290 --> 00:16:19.780
together and so we're boiling it down
here

00:16:19.780 --> 00:16:19.790
here
 

00:16:19.790 --> 00:16:22.630
here
but but it is true that the other part

00:16:22.630 --> 00:16:22.640
but but it is true that the other part
 

00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:24.160
but but it is true that the other part
of the science we found so compelling is

00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:24.170
of the science we found so compelling is
 

00:16:24.170 --> 00:16:25.420
of the science we found so compelling is
what Kathy was just talking about which

00:16:25.420 --> 00:16:25.430
what Kathy was just talking about which
 

00:16:25.430 --> 00:16:28.180
what Kathy was just talking about which
is that brain plasticity and so when

00:16:28.180 --> 00:16:28.190
is that brain plasticity and so when
 

00:16:28.190 --> 00:16:30.790
is that brain plasticity and so when
you're talking about volitional or our

00:16:30.790 --> 00:16:30.800
you're talking about volitional or our
 

00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:32.650
you're talking about volitional or our
ability to affect things now what's so

00:16:32.650 --> 00:16:32.660
ability to affect things now what's so
 

00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:34.450
ability to affect things now what's so
exciting about the science is you can

00:16:34.450 --> 00:16:34.460
exciting about the science is you can
 

00:16:34.460 --> 00:16:37.480
exciting about the science is you can
see that happening right you can see the

00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:37.490
see that happening right you can see the
 

00:16:37.490 --> 00:16:39.850
see that happening right you can see the
way we can rewire our brains to some

00:16:39.850 --> 00:16:39.860
way we can rewire our brains to some
 

00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:41.290
way we can rewire our brains to some

it's really exciting I'm glad you raised

00:16:54.220 --> 00:16:54.230
it's really exciting I'm glad you raised
 

00:16:54.230 --> 00:16:55.600
it's really exciting I'm glad you raised
that because I was going to mention that

00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:55.610
that because I was going to mention that
 

00:16:55.610 --> 00:16:57.130
that because I was going to mention that
that you raised the issue of blame brain

00:16:57.130 --> 00:16:57.140
that you raised the issue of blame brain
 

00:16:57.140 --> 00:16:58.780
that you raised the issue of blame brain
plasticity in the book in part because

it you know there's the the genetic

00:17:00.940 --> 00:17:00.950
it you know there's the the genetic
 

00:17:00.950 --> 00:17:02.980
it you know there's the the genetic
studies leave you sort of in a bit of a

00:17:02.980 --> 00:17:02.990
studies leave you sort of in a bit of a
 

00:17:02.990 --> 00:17:06.160
studies leave you sort of in a bit of a
corner and you know how like you know

00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:06.170
corner and you know how like you know
 

00:17:06.170 --> 00:17:08.170

I'm sort of stuck with this and you know

00:17:08.170 --> 00:17:08.180
I'm sort of stuck with this and you know
 

00:17:08.180 --> 00:17:11.230

what's fascinating about the book is

00:17:16.270 --> 00:17:16.280
what's fascinating about the book is
 

00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:17.830
what's fascinating about the book is
that there's you offer a lot of sort of

00:17:17.830 --> 00:17:17.840
that there's you offer a lot of sort of
 

00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:19.420
that there's you offer a lot of sort of
possibilities actually there's sort of

00:17:19.420 --> 00:17:19.430
possibilities actually there's sort of
 

00:17:19.430 --> 00:17:21.370
possibilities actually there's sort of
we identified you identify the gap and

00:17:21.370 --> 00:17:21.380
we identified you identify the gap and
 

00:17:21.380 --> 00:17:23.620
we identified you identify the gap and
then you say confidence can be built you

00:17:23.620 --> 00:17:23.630
then you say confidence can be built you
 

00:17:23.630 --> 00:17:25.330
then you say confidence can be built you
know that like the brain our brains are

you can you say a little bit about about

00:17:29.470 --> 00:17:29.480
you can you say a little bit about about
 

00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:31.470
you can you say a little bit about about
how you build one builds confidence

00:17:31.470 --> 00:17:31.480
how you build one builds confidence
 

00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:34.600
how you build one builds confidence
broadly speaking it kind of divides into

00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:34.610
broadly speaking it kind of divides into
 

00:17:34.610 --> 00:17:36.880
broadly speaking it kind of divides into
two categories one is we need to act

00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:36.890
two categories one is we need to act
 

00:17:36.890 --> 00:17:40.990
two categories one is we need to act
more which means being prepared to take

00:17:40.990 --> 00:17:41.000
more which means being prepared to take
 

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.320
more which means being prepared to take
risks go outside your comfort zone do

00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:44.330
risks go outside your comfort zone do
 

00:17:44.330 --> 00:17:46.570
risks go outside your comfort zone do
things that you find hard for yourself

00:17:46.570 --> 00:17:46.580
things that you find hard for yourself
 

00:17:46.580 --> 00:17:48.250
things that you find hard for yourself
because that's how you grow your

it doesn't actually challenge my

00:17:55.630 --> 00:17:55.640
it doesn't actually challenge my
 

00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:57.310
it doesn't actually challenge my
confidence because I've done it so many

00:17:57.310 --> 00:17:57.320
confidence because I've done it so many
 

00:17:57.320 --> 00:17:59.590

times that I know I can do it inside my
 

00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:03.130
times that I know I can do it inside my
comfort zone I would be terrified of

doing your job I would have no idea that
I could do it

I could do it
 

00:18:06.470 --> 00:18:08.890
I could do it
the only way I would ever find out would

00:18:08.890 --> 00:18:08.900
the only way I would ever find out would
 

00:18:08.900 --> 00:18:12.280
the only way I would ever find out would
be trying so it can be as simple as you

00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:12.290
be trying so it can be as simple as you

News tend to feel very guilty when I'm
 

00:21:34.340 --> 00:21:36.039
News tend to feel very guilty when I'm
working on another project and I'm not

00:21:36.039 --> 00:21:36.049
working on another project and I'm not
 

00:21:36.049 --> 00:21:37.720

soon and I don't hear back from her and

00:21:43.869 --> 00:21:43.879
soon and I don't hear back from her and
 

00:21:43.879 --> 00:21:46.509
soon and I don't hear back from her and
within two hours I'm obsessively

00:21:46.509 --> 00:21:46.519
within two hours I'm obsessively
 

00:21:46.519 --> 00:21:49.119
within two hours I'm obsessively
thinking that she must be incredibly mad

00:21:49.119 --> 00:21:49.129
thinking that she must be incredibly mad
 

00:21:49.129 --> 00:21:51.639
thinking that she must be incredibly mad
at me because I'm working on my book and

00:21:51.639 --> 00:21:51.649
at me because I'm working on my book and
 

00:21:51.649 --> 00:21:53.680
at me because I'm working on my book and
I haven't been doing this and then

00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:53.690
I haven't been doing this and then
 

00:21:53.690 --> 00:21:56.289
I haven't been doing this and then
within four hours having not heard back

00:21:56.289 --> 00:21:56.299
within four hours having not heard back
 

00:21:56.299 --> 00:21:58.570
within four hours having not heard back
I'm ruminating about whether everybody

00:21:58.570 --> 00:21:58.580
I'm ruminating about whether everybody
 

00:21:58.580 --> 00:22:00.730
I'm ruminating about whether everybody
at ABC News is actually mad at me at

00:22:00.730 --> 00:22:00.740
at ABC News is actually mad at me at
 

00:22:00.740 --> 00:22:02.470
at ABC News is actually mad at me at
that point and they all do and then by

00:22:02.470 --> 00:22:02.480
that point and they all do and then by
 

00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:03.820
that point and they all do and then by
the next day I think I should call my

00:22:03.820 --> 00:22:03.830
the next day I think I should call my
 

00:22:03.830 --> 00:22:06.489
the next day I think I should call my
agent because I probably won't have a

00:22:06.489 --> 00:22:06.499
agent because I probably won't have a
 

00:22:06.499 --> 00:22:09.369
agent because I probably won't have a
job anymore and another day or two and

00:22:09.369 --> 00:22:09.379
job anymore and another day or two and
 

00:22:09.379 --> 00:22:11.560
job anymore and another day or two and
and it just and you can see how that I

00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:11.570
and it just and you can see how that I
 

00:22:11.570 --> 00:22:14.139
and it just and you can see how that I
mean I couldn't get any work done it's

00:22:14.139 --> 00:22:14.149
mean I couldn't get any work done it's
 

00:22:14.149 --> 00:22:17.710
mean I couldn't get any work done it's
interesting we the the fix for it is is

00:22:17.710 --> 00:22:17.720
interesting we the the fix for it is is
 

00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:19.359
interesting we the the fix for it is is
fascinating though because there's so

00:22:19.359 --> 00:22:19.369
fascinating though because there's so
 

00:22:19.369 --> 00:22:21.669
fascinating though because there's so
much research on just basic cognitive

00:22:21.669 --> 00:22:21.679
much research on just basic cognitive
 

00:22:21.679 --> 00:22:23.889
much research on just basic cognitive
behavioral therapy techniques you can

00:22:23.889 --> 00:22:23.899
behavioral therapy techniques you can
 

00:22:23.899 --> 00:22:27.159
behavioral therapy techniques you can
use to stop that and and for me this has

00:22:27.159 --> 00:22:27.169
use to stop that and and for me this has
 

00:22:27.169 --> 00:22:29.230
use to stop that and and for me this has
been such a key because I'm a real

00:22:29.230 --> 00:22:29.240
been such a key because I'm a real
 

00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:31.060
been such a key because I'm a real
obsessive thinker all you have to do is

00:22:31.060 --> 00:22:31.070
obsessive thinker all you have to do is
 

00:22:31.070 --> 00:22:33.639
obsessive thinker all you have to do is
come up with any alternative explanation

00:22:33.639 --> 00:22:33.649
come up with any alternative explanation
 

00:22:33.649 --> 00:22:36.129
come up with any alternative explanation
to whatever your is going on in your

00:22:36.129 --> 00:22:36.139
to whatever your is going on in your
 

00:22:36.139 --> 00:22:37.629
to whatever your is going on in your
head and it will stop the process so

00:22:37.629 --> 00:22:37.639
head and it will stop the process so
 

00:22:37.639 --> 00:22:40.029
head and it will stop the process so
just for example Diane Sawyer just got

00:22:40.029 --> 00:22:40.039
just for example Diane Sawyer just got
 

00:22:40.039 --> 00:22:41.710
just for example Diane Sawyer just got
back from Africa of course she's not

00:22:41.710 --> 00:22:41.720
back from Africa of course she's not
 

00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:43.269
back from Africa of course she's not
going to email me back tonight or the

00:22:43.269 --> 00:22:43.279
going to email me back tonight or the
 

00:22:43.279 --> 00:22:45.310
going to email me back tonight or the
broadcast is in two hours or she usually

00:22:45.310 --> 00:22:45.320
broadcast is in two hours or she usually
 

00:22:45.320 --> 00:22:47.200
broadcast is in two hours or she usually
emails me back on the weekends and what

00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:47.210
emails me back on the weekends and what
 

00:22:47.210 --> 00:22:49.299
emails me back on the weekends and what
I love about this research is that it

00:22:49.299 --> 00:22:49.309
I love about this research is that it
 

00:22:49.309 --> 00:22:51.009
I love about this research is that it
doesn't even have to be a reasonable

00:22:51.009 --> 00:22:51.019
doesn't even have to be a reasonable
 

00:22:51.019 --> 00:22:52.300
doesn't even have to be a reasonable
explanation

00:22:52.300 --> 00:22:52.310
explanation
 

00:22:52.310 --> 00:22:54.220
explanation
it's that you're giving yourself it does

00:22:54.220 --> 00:22:54.230
it's that you're giving yourself it does
 

00:22:54.230 --> 00:22:56.530
it's that you're giving yourself it does
not it's it's anything will do because

00:22:56.530 --> 00:22:56.540
not it's it's anything will do because
 

00:22:56.540 --> 00:22:59.770
not it's it's anything will do because
it stops yes the process and the

00:22:59.770 --> 00:22:59.780
it stops yes the process and the
 

00:22:59.780 --> 00:23:01.540
it stops yes the process and the
research on this is fascinating and it

00:23:01.540 --> 00:23:01.550
research on this is fascinating and it
 

00:23:01.550 --> 00:23:04.120
research on this is fascinating and it
and we have I mean both of us have been

00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:04.130
and we have I mean both of us have been
 

00:23:04.130 --> 00:23:06.520
and we have I mean both of us have been
using this and it really is a difference

00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:06.530
using this and it really is a difference
 

00:23:06.530 --> 00:23:09.160
using this and it really is a difference
between men and women I think that men

00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:09.170
between men and women I think that men
 

00:23:09.170 --> 00:23:13.840
between men and women I think that men
do seem to be much better at letting

00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:13.850
do seem to be much better at letting
 

00:23:13.850 --> 00:23:15.970
do seem to be much better at letting
things roll off their back they will

00:23:15.970 --> 00:23:15.980
things roll off their back they will
 

00:23:15.980 --> 00:23:17.920
things roll off their back they will
have an upset or a criticism or

00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:17.930
have an upset or a criticism or
 

00:23:17.930 --> 00:23:19.900
have an upset or a criticism or
something will go wrong will they'll

00:23:19.900 --> 00:23:19.910
something will go wrong will they'll
 

00:23:19.910 --> 00:23:22.120
something will go wrong will they'll
have a Rao at work or with a friend and

00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:22.130
have a Rao at work or with a friend and
 

00:23:22.130 --> 00:23:24.970
have a Rao at work or with a friend and
it suddenly just goes and we cling and

00:23:24.970 --> 00:23:24.980
it suddenly just goes and we cling and
 

00:23:24.980 --> 00:23:26.530
it suddenly just goes and we cling and
we're like dogs with a burn you know we

00:23:26.530 --> 00:23:26.540
we're like dogs with a burn you know we
 

00:23:26.540 --> 00:23:29.200
we're like dogs with a burn you know we
cling to it those little things yeah so

00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:29.210
cling to it those little things yeah so
 

00:23:29.210 --> 00:23:31.300
cling to it those little things yeah so
there's so the confidence gap isn't part

00:23:31.300 --> 00:23:31.310
there's so the confidence gap isn't part
 

00:23:31.310 --> 00:23:33.700
there's so the confidence gap isn't part
of perfectionism gap and part of the

00:23:33.700 --> 00:23:33.710
of perfectionism gap and part of the
 

00:23:33.710 --> 00:23:36.460
of perfectionism gap and part of the
rumination gap there's a other sorts of

00:23:36.460 --> 00:23:36.470
rumination gap there's a other sorts of
 

00:23:36.470 --> 00:23:37.600
rumination gap there's a other sorts of
things that are part of it that's

00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:37.610
things that are part of it that's
 

00:23:37.610 --> 00:23:40.870
things that are part of it that's
interesting okay so I wanted to sow

00:23:40.870 --> 00:23:40.880
interesting okay so I wanted to sow
 

00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:42.430
interesting okay so I wanted to sow
confidence I'm I'm compelled that it's a

00:23:42.430 --> 00:23:42.440
confidence I'm I'm compelled that it's a
 

00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:44.950
confidence I'm I'm compelled that it's a
good thing talk about the difference

00:23:44.950 --> 00:23:44.960
good thing talk about the difference
 

00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:47.440
good thing talk about the difference
between confidence and being bossy right

00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:47.450
between confidence and being bossy right
 

00:23:47.450 --> 00:23:49.980
between confidence and being bossy right
so in recent weeks there was a study

00:23:49.980 --> 00:23:49.990
so in recent weeks there was a study
 

00:23:49.990 --> 00:23:52.540
so in recent weeks there was a study
some behavioral science research from

00:23:52.540 --> 00:23:52.550
some behavioral science research from
 

00:23:52.550 --> 00:23:54.280
some behavioral science research from
the new lab at Northeastern University

00:23:54.280 --> 00:23:54.290
the new lab at Northeastern University
 

00:23:54.290 --> 00:23:57.220
the new lab at Northeastern University
they used 14 million student evaluation

00:23:57.220 --> 00:23:57.230
they used 14 million student evaluation
 

00:23:57.230 --> 00:24:00.430
they used 14 million student evaluation
data points and surprise surprise women

00:24:00.430 --> 00:24:00.440
data points and surprise surprise women
 

00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:02.080

their male counterparts to beacon called
 

00:24:03.650 --> 00:24:06.850
their male counterparts to beacon called
because called bossy a similar study of

00:24:06.850 --> 00:24:06.860
because called bossy a similar study of
 

00:24:06.860 --> 00:24:09.400
because called bossy a similar study of
Technology workplaces found that women

00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:09.410
Technology workplaces found that women
 

00:24:09.410 --> 00:24:10.900
Technology workplaces found that women
are more likely to be called aggressive

00:24:10.900 --> 00:24:10.910
are more likely to be called aggressive
 

00:24:10.910 --> 00:24:12.580
are more likely to be called aggressive
and abrasive and their performance

00:24:12.580 --> 00:24:12.590
and abrasive and their performance
 

00:24:12.590 --> 00:24:13.270

so is there relationship between these

00:24:15.910 --> 00:24:15.920
so is there relationship between these
 

00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:17.530
so is there relationship between these
studies would suggest that women in

00:24:17.530 --> 00:24:17.540
studies would suggest that women in
 

00:24:17.540 --> 00:24:19.150
studies would suggest that women in
leadership roles or women you might say

00:24:19.150 --> 00:24:19.160
leadership roles or women you might say

negative light and your investigations
of the confidence gap how do we is that

00:24:24.730 --> 00:24:24.740
of the confidence gap how do we is that

are dozens of studies in academia and in

00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:34.610
are dozens of studies in academia and in
 

00:24:34.610 --> 00:24:37.570
are dozens of studies in academia and in
corporate life that show that when women

00:24:37.570 --> 00:24:37.580
corporate life that show that when women
 

00:24:37.580 --> 00:24:40.270
corporate life that show that when women
behave just as men do they tend to get

00:24:40.270 --> 00:24:40.280
behave just as men do they tend to get
 

00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:43.600
behave just as men do they tend to get
penalized for it we men are seen as good

00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:43.610
penalized for it we men are seen as good

leaders we are seen as overly aggressive

00:24:45.790 --> 00:24:45.800
leaders we are seen as overly aggressive
 

00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:48.730
leaders we are seen as overly aggressive
or overly assertive and we wrestled with

00:24:48.730 --> 00:24:48.740
or overly assertive and we wrestled with
 

00:24:48.740 --> 00:24:50.650
or overly assertive and we wrestled with
this a lot while we were writing the

00:24:50.650 --> 00:24:50.660
this a lot while we were writing the
 

00:24:50.660 --> 00:24:52.180
this a lot while we were writing the
book and basically it was the question

00:24:52.180 --> 00:24:52.190
book and basically it was the question
 

00:24:52.190 --> 00:24:53.800
book and basically it was the question
was do you have to be a jerk to be

00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:53.810
was do you have to be a jerk to be
 

00:24:53.810 --> 00:24:55.570
was do you have to be a jerk to be
confident and that was kind of how it

we're talking about and what we've been

00:30:17.250 --> 00:30:17.260
we're talking about and what we've been
 

00:30:17.260 --> 00:30:19.680
we're talking about and what we've been
talking about subsequently is just good

00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:19.690

management yeah for example and I think
 

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:23.430
management yeah for example and I think
in the in the same way when we're

00:30:23.430 --> 00:30:23.440
in the in the same way when we're
 

00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:25.950
in the in the same way when we're
looking at what how does one manifest

00:30:25.950 --> 00:30:25.960
looking at what how does one manifest
 

00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:28.530
looking at what how does one manifest
confidence what will work for men or for

00:30:28.530 --> 00:30:28.540

spectrum we are generalizing really by

00:30:34.230 --> 00:30:34.240
spectrum we are generalizing really by
 

00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:36.240
spectrum we are generalizing really by
need I mean some of it makes sense and

00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:36.250
need I mean some of it makes sense and
 

00:30:36.250 --> 00:30:38.070
need I mean some of it makes sense and
the stereotypes often makes sense for

00:30:38.070 --> 00:30:38.080
the stereotypes often makes sense for
 

00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:40.290
the stereotypes often makes sense for
women but I think when we look at a lot

00:30:40.290 --> 00:30:40.300
women but I think when we look at a lot
 

00:30:40.300 --> 00:30:41.400
women but I think when we look at a lot
of this information is going to be

00:30:41.400 --> 00:30:41.410
of this information is going to be
 

00:30:41.410 --> 00:30:45.030
of this information is going to be
useful to everybody it's not really men

00:30:45.030 --> 00:30:45.040
useful to everybody it's not really men
 

00:30:45.040 --> 00:30:46.830
useful to everybody it's not really men
or women I mean don't you think yeah and

00:30:46.830 --> 00:30:46.840
or women I mean don't you think yeah and
 

00:30:46.840 --> 00:30:50.190
or women I mean don't you think yeah and
I think the other thing I would say

00:30:50.190 --> 00:30:50.200
I think the other thing I would say
 

00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:52.440

mean you can think about this as you
have in a very sophisticated way as the

00:37:03.730 --> 00:37:03.740
have in a very sophisticated way as the
 

00:37:03.740 --> 00:37:06.280

their confidence and their success in
 

00:37:09.830 --> 00:37:12.849
their confidence and their success in
their own terms and and then there's of

00:37:12.849 --> 00:37:12.859
their own terms and and then there's of
 

00:37:12.859 --> 00:37:16.690
their own terms and and then there's of
course changing the world in which we

00:37:16.690 --> 00:37:16.700
course changing the world in which we
 

00:37:16.700 --> 00:37:22.599
course changing the world in which we
all live and we've seen cycles in civil

00:37:22.599 --> 00:37:22.609
all live and we've seen cycles in civil
 

00:37:22.609 --> 00:37:25.930

rights and passages of laws over time

00:37:25.930 --> 00:37:25.940
rights and passages of laws over time
 

00:37:25.940 --> 00:37:29.410
rights and passages of laws over time
and I would say you know we're at not

00:37:29.410 --> 00:37:29.420
and I would say you know we're at not
 

00:37:29.420 --> 00:37:32.859
and I would say you know we're at not
one of the stronger periods of real deep

00:37:32.859 --> 00:37:32.869
one of the stronger periods of real deep
 

00:37:32.869 --> 00:37:36.070

in order for all kinds of greater
equality across the board so I mean my

00:37:46.570 --> 00:37:46.580
equality across the board so I mean my
 

00:37:46.580 --> 00:37:49.900
equality across the board so I mean my
view is you know we would benefit from a

00:37:49.900 --> 00:37:49.910
view is you know we would benefit from a
 

00:37:49.910 --> 00:37:52.210
view is you know we would benefit from a
new civil rights movement for example so

00:37:52.210 --> 00:37:52.220
new civil rights movement for example so
 

00:37:52.220 --> 00:37:55.330
new civil rights movement for example so

more just world it would be Pollyannish
 

00:38:10.220 --> 00:38:12.849
more just world it would be Pollyannish
to suggest that just by closing the

to suggest that just by closing the
 

00:38:12.859 --> 00:38:16.120
to suggest that just by closing the
confidence gap we could suddenly level

00:38:16.120 --> 00:38:16.130
confidence gap we could suddenly level
 

00:38:16.130 --> 00:38:18.310

two aspects and one of them was to take
 

00:47:04.419 --> 00:47:06.900
two aspects and one of them was to take
more risks and that's what you were

00:47:06.900 --> 00:47:06.910
more risks and that's what you were
 

00:47:06.910 --> 00:47:09.599

saying and then I kind of was waiting
 

00:47:09.609 --> 00:47:11.819
saying and then I kind of was waiting
for the whole rest of the talk so to see

00:47:11.819 --> 00:47:11.829
for the whole rest of the talk so to see
 

00:47:11.829 --> 00:47:14.370
for the whole rest of the talk so to see

00:47:14.370 --> 00:47:14.380
what's the other aspect so that's the
 

00:47:14.380 --> 00:47:17.579
what's the other aspect so that's the
first part and the second part is I

00:47:17.579 --> 00:47:17.589

a risk in doing this today because it

00:47:21.449 --> 00:47:21.459
a risk in doing this today because it
 

00:47:21.459 --> 00:47:22.829
a risk in doing this today because it
feels like a risky day because I just

00:47:22.829 --> 00:47:22.839
feels like a risky day because I just
 

00:47:22.839 --> 00:47:23.969

00:47:40.630 --> 00:47:42.209
that so that translates to me as women
being more accurate so it's not that

00:47:42.209 --> 00:47:42.219
being more accurate so it's not that
 

00:47:42.219 --> 00:47:44.939
being more accurate so it's not that
women are not confident enough it's that

00:47:44.939 --> 00:47:44.949
women are not confident enough it's that
 

00:47:44.949 --> 00:47:47.880
women are not confident enough it's that
men are actually overconfident and I

00:47:47.880 --> 00:47:47.890
men are actually overconfident and I
 

00:47:47.890 --> 00:47:50.279

don't mean that as a joke I mean it as

00:47:50.279 --> 00:47:50.289
don't mean that as a joke I mean it as

somebody who's studied like

00:47:51.559 --> 00:47:51.569
somebody who's studied like
 

00:47:51.569 --> 00:47:54.089
somebody who's studied like
neuropsychology etc I was a psych majors

neuropsychology etc I was a psych majors
 

00:47:54.099 --> 00:47:55.949
neuropsychology etc I was a psych majors
and undergrad and so my question is

00:47:55.949 --> 00:47:55.959
and undergrad and so my question is
 

00:47:55.959 --> 00:47:58.709
and undergrad and so my question is
instead of seeing that as a deficit is

00:47:58.709 --> 00:47:58.719
instead of seeing that as a deficit is
 

00:47:58.719 --> 00:48:01.219
instead of seeing that as a deficit is
there a way we can change within

00:48:01.219 --> 00:48:01.229
there a way we can change within
 

00:48:01.229 --> 00:48:04.109
there a way we can change within
leadership within the work world just

00:48:04.109 --> 00:48:04.119

the definition of you know what we think
 

00:48:07.599 --> 00:48:10.919
the definition of you know what we think
of as confidence so that you know a

00:48:10.919 --> 00:48:10.929
of as confidence so that you know a
 

00:48:10.929 --> 00:48:12.509
of as confidence so that you know a
six-year-old doesn't say well she's a

00:48:12.509 --> 00:48:12.519
six-year-old doesn't say well she's a
 

00:48:12.519 --> 00:48:15.390

Sciences Department I'm actually curious
 

00:48:23.100 --> 00:48:26.810
Sciences Department I'm actually curious
about your research on if it's has

00:48:26.810 --> 00:48:26.820
about your research on if it's has
 

00:48:26.820 --> 00:48:30.860
about your research on if it's has
actually came up on generational changes

00:48:30.860 --> 00:48:30.870
actually came up on generational changes
 

00:48:30.870 --> 00:48:34.040
actually came up on generational changes
and challenges I am you know from

00:48:34.040 --> 00:48:34.050
and challenges I am you know from
 

00:48:34.050 --> 00:48:35.930
and challenges I am you know from
Jamaica and you know pushing through

00:48:35.930 --> 00:48:35.940
Jamaica and you know pushing through
 

00:48:35.940 --> 00:48:38.000
Jamaica and you know pushing through
from my mom's kind of experiences and

00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:38.010
from my mom's kind of experiences and
 

00:48:38.010 --> 00:48:39.350

breaking through certain barriers was a

00:48:39.350 --> 00:48:39.360
breaking through certain barriers was a
 

00:48:39.360 --> 00:48:41.120
breaking through certain barriers was a
big deal but then when I came to America

00:48:41.120 --> 00:48:41.130
big deal but then when I came to America
 

00:48:41.130 --> 00:48:43.100
big deal but then when I came to America
it was sort of there was still more to

00:48:43.100 --> 00:48:43.110
it was sort of there was still more to
 

00:48:43.110 --> 00:48:45.200
it was sort of there was still more to
go so I'm just really curious about you

00:48:45.200 --> 00:48:45.210
go so I'm just really curious about you
 

00:48:45.210 --> 00:48:46.670
go so I'm just really curious about you
know kind of what your research showed

00:48:46.670 --> 00:48:46.680
know kind of what your research showed
 

00:48:46.680 --> 00:48:48.250
know kind of what your research showed
you want sort of pushing that envelope

00:48:48.250 --> 00:48:48.260
you want sort of pushing that envelope
 

00:48:48.260 --> 00:48:51.200
you want sort of pushing that envelope
from a generational point of view so we

00:48:51.200 --> 00:48:51.210
from a generational point of view so we
 

00:48:51.210 --> 00:48:58.250
from a generational point of view so we
got four questions what was the fifth

00:48:58.250 --> 00:48:58.260
got four questions what was the fifth
 

00:48:58.260 --> 00:49:02.480
got four questions what was the fifth
question yeah so young six year old

00:49:02.480 --> 00:49:02.490
question yeah so young six year old
 

00:49:02.490 --> 00:49:05.450
question yeah so young six year old
thinks well women can't be present a six

00:49:05.450 --> 00:49:05.460
thinks well women can't be present a six
 

00:49:05.460 --> 00:49:07.910
thinks well women can't be present a six
year old I could say that I think having

00:49:07.910 --> 00:49:07.920
year old I could say that I think having
 

00:49:07.920 --> 00:49:10.280
year old I could say that I think having
experienced that myself recently with my

00:49:10.280 --> 00:49:10.290
experienced that myself recently with my
 

00:49:10.290 --> 00:49:13.010
experienced that myself recently with my
daughter it's a but it was now nine look

00:49:13.010 --> 00:49:13.020
daughter it's a but it was now nine look
 

00:49:13.020 --> 00:49:15.830

it's you know they see more than just

00:49:15.830 --> 00:49:15.840
it's you know they see more than just
 

00:49:15.840 --> 00:49:18.260
it's you know they see more than just
they see more than just their parents

00:49:18.260 --> 00:49:18.270
they see more than just their parents
 

00:49:18.270 --> 00:49:20.630
they see more than just their parents
right so kids are smart I mean they look

00:49:20.630 --> 00:49:20.640
right so kids are smart I mean they look
 

00:49:20.640 --> 00:49:22.940
right so kids are smart I mean they look
out and they see that you know why would

why would any young girl necessarily

00:49:26.750 --> 00:49:26.760
why would any young girl necessarily
 

00:49:26.760 --> 00:49:28.910
why would any young girl necessarily
assume a woman would be president we

00:49:28.910 --> 00:49:28.920
assume a woman would be president we
 

00:49:28.920 --> 00:49:30.620
assume a woman would be president we
haven't had one right and so I think

00:49:30.620 --> 00:49:30.630
haven't had one right and so I think
 

00:49:30.630 --> 00:49:33.560
haven't had one right and so I think
it's it's not necessarily I think we are

00:49:33.560 --> 00:49:33.570
it's it's not necessarily I think we are
 

00:49:33.570 --> 00:49:35.810
it's it's not necessarily I think we are
incredibly important as role models but

00:49:35.810 --> 00:49:35.820
incredibly important as role models but
 

00:49:35.820 --> 00:49:38.510
incredibly important as role models but
I think we have to be realistic about

00:49:38.510 --> 00:49:38.520
I think we have to be realistic about
 

00:49:38.520 --> 00:49:41.450
I think we have to be realistic about
what else they're seeing in the world

00:49:41.450 --> 00:49:41.460
what else they're seeing in the world
 

00:49:41.460 --> 00:49:43.370
what else they're seeing in the world
and and that's what when I was saying I

00:49:43.370 --> 00:49:43.380
and and that's what when I was saying I
 

00:49:43.380 --> 00:49:45.050
and and that's what when I was saying I
think we can talk to them about it be

it under the carpet just lay it all out
there and use that as a as a chance for

suffered a little bit as we all need to
 

00:54:50.920 --> 00:54:53.490
suffered a little bit as we all need to
do and we fail just to try to look at it

00:54:53.490 --> 00:54:53.500
do and we fail just to try to look at it
 

00:54:53.500 --> 00:54:56.130
do and we fail just to try to look at it
as what what can you learn from it I

00:54:56.130 --> 00:54:56.140
as what what can you learn from it I
 

00:54:56.140 --> 00:54:57.720
as what what can you learn from it I
mean what what are the lessons you can

00:54:57.720 --> 00:54:57.730
mean what what are the lessons you can
 

00:54:57.730 --> 00:55:00.630
mean what what are the lessons you can
learn from what has just happened so

00:55:00.630 --> 00:55:00.640
learn from what has just happened so
 

00:55:00.640 --> 00:55:02.580

Valentini and I were talking about this
earlier think about it as pivoting to

00:55:10.260 --> 00:55:10.270
earlier think about it as pivoting to
 

00:55:10.270 --> 00:55:13.620
earlier think about it as pivoting to
your next experiment your next challenge

00:55:13.620 --> 00:55:13.630
your next experiment your next challenge
 

00:55:13.630 --> 00:55:15.780
your next experiment your next challenge
and you take what information you have

00:55:15.780 --> 00:55:15.790
and you take what information you have
 

00:55:15.790 --> 00:55:17.370
and you take what information you have
from that failure which was part of the

00:55:17.370 --> 00:55:17.380
from that failure which was part of the
 

00:55:17.380 --> 00:55:21.210
from that failure which was part of the
learning process and and move on I can't
