00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.120
So just got back from the grocery store. I picked up a couple more coconuts

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.960
These things are about five dollars each and you can see they are just the nuts

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.960
There's no husks on these things now remember how coconuts

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.059
Have a little face like two eyes and a little mouth

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:14.849
That bottom hole is the softest of all three holes

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.739
And you might be surprised to know if you just take something like a stick or a twig you can just work it around in

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.969
That mouth and burrow out a hole that [goes] right to the center of the nut so you can pour the water out

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:28.470
It's actually really surprising just how easy it is to push a hole right through the mouth

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.160
I mean that just glides in like nothing, but if you were to try the same thing to the eyes

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.469
You're going to notice they have a lot more resistance

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:38.879
Now if you don't have a stick you can always use just a pair of scissors as well

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.739
Just poke it in and twist it around and that's just going to help open up that mouth a little bit better

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.659
and that should make your hole big enough that you can tip this thing over and pour out all your coconut water without losing a

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.660
drop

00:00:55.449 --> 00:01:00.269
if you still want to get to the meat inside you can still crack these things in half and have yourself a meal or if

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:04.120
You want to leave them in this condition? You can fill these up with fresh water stop off the hole

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:08.020
You've got yourself a little improvised water canteen or you can fill it up with black powder

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.300
Sticking a fuse and you get yourself a coconut bomb like Swiss Family Robinson

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.659
That's something I've always wanted to try I picked up another coconut just to show you again

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:21.329
How easy that really is. Now if we take our stick even a blunt end of the stick and just push it in there?

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:26.970
We can just carve it around to where it makes a hole straight through the coconut you can see this is bursting to come out

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.970
there

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:32.840
That is really good stuff. You remember this stuff

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.619
This is the rope that I made in a previous video out of coconut husk as well

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:42.259
But ropes not just good for tying together rafts or string up clotheslines you can also use it as an improvised wick

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:46.160
Which means we can probably make ourselves a coconut candle so here's the idea

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:47.540
if you took another coconut

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:53.270
And shred it up all the meat you could actually extract all the coconut milk and out of the coconut milk you could extract yourself

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:59.660
Coconut oil this stuff is going to be the fuel for our coconut candle so we got our fuel we got our candle

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:01.939
We've got our wick [all] we have to do now is put them all together

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:07.610
Cut off a length of your coconut husk a rope and simply wrap it around your fingers to make yourself a nice little loop like

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.779
this when you set this on the table you now have a place for the base of your coconut to sit

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:15.559
So your coconut stands upright without rolling all over the place now

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.910
We're going to do is take some of our coconut oil and fill up our coconut then take the rest of our rope and push

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:24.589
It down inside to act as a wick. I'm really curious to see whether or not. This is actually going to work

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.509
Right that's had a couple of minutes to soak let's light it off now to light these wicks

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.550
You're just going to need to hold a flame on them for about

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.380
twenty to thirty seconds just enough to heat up the oil the point where it's self-sustaining

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.080
We have the ignition

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.740
Think we've just created ourselves a coconut candle

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:55.589
Now what should be happening is as the flame heats up the oil I should start wicking up more oil from underneath

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:58.830
So rather than burning the wick and completely consuming it

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.030
It'll just start burning off the oil vapors and create a nice little candle for us

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:08.519
If you want a bigger flame tilt your coconut over to about 45 degrees this will make it

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:11.939
So the oil can flow a little bit more freely and your flames going to grow exponentially

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:17.530
It actually smells really nice

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:21.179
If you were to take some of this stuff and wrap it around a stick and Soak it in coconut oil

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:27.120
You could probably make yourself a torch as well, so with a little coconut oil some homemade coconut husk rope and some coconuts

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:32.759
We just made ourselves some cool little coconut candles remember guys you go 90 percent. She goes 10

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:37.020
Thanks so much for joining me for this experiment. I'll be looking for you the next video. Talk to you then

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:41.339
Looks like our little coconut guys doing something he probably shouldn't
