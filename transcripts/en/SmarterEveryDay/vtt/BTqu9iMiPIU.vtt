00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.960
Hey it's me Destin welcome back to smarter every day

00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:07.060
One of the reasons I absolutely love helicopters is that you can get places that you can't with any other device

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:09.660
So  today I'm with Bradley Friesen here in where?

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.440
Bradley: We're, uh, right now in British Columbia, at Widgeon Lake in beautiful Pinecone Burke park

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:18.020
Alright, so we're going to talk about helicopters in a way that you might not have thought of before

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:19.520
but first, let's do the safe landing

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.980
Bradley: So we're coming into what we call mother nature's helipad here on Widgeon Lake

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:25.840
Bradley: Right here we go

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.500
I know is that incredible or what?

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:39.720
Today on Smarter Every Day I wanna talk about a particular misconception when it comes to helicopters

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:42.920
A very famous well-respected scientist recently tweeted

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.690
"That if an airplane loses an engine it
turns into a glider

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:48.960
But if a helicopter loses a engine, it turns into brick."

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.560
Today on Smarter Every Day, I want to questions this

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:53.280
by literally putting my life on the line.

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:55.260
I'm going back into the helicopter

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.300
and we're gonna power down the engine and we're gonna see what happens

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.180
How do we get to earth safely?

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:00.420
But before we do that,

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:01.980
Let just go and enjoy this

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:03.060
in the helicopter,

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:05.660
and let go meet an expert on auto rotation.

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.580
let's get Smarter Every Day.

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:26.600
Destin a little birdie told me that
you took interest in one of my tweets

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:27.959
where I commented that it

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:29.399
airplane whose engine dies,

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:30.920
lands like a gilder.

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.880
Whereas helicopter whose engine dies,

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:35.420
lands like a brick.

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:38.780
Assuming that the propeller blades not rotating.

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:40.360
But now I hear,

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.040
that you know of a way to land a helicopter with a busted engine

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.180
well, if so I wanna know about it.

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:48.320
You know why?

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.700
cause I want to get smarter every day.

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.480
so I'll be watching

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:57.800
What a super classy way of
responding to somebody whining about one of your tweets on the internet

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.280
thank you very much Neil and you're kind of right at

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.680
if the rotor blade quits turning you are
gonna fall like a brick.

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.480
But helicopter pilots have a physics trick to keep that from happening.

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:10.700
When a helicopter engine is running it acts like a big fan blowing down the air.

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.580
If you try the fan off, it stops blowing and starts to fall

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:16.220
changing the direction that the air goes through the rotors.

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.220
Just like a powered fan can create air movement,

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:22.480
air movement can create fan movement just like pinwheel.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.200
Helicopter pilot have ability precisely change to pitch their blades

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.040
by adjusting the control called Collective.

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.280
By doing this whenever the
engine dies they can quickly adjust from

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:34.980
this powered fan mode to pinwheel modes
that they can use that air that's now

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:38.569
coming up to the bottom of the rotor
system to keep the blades turning all

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:40.249
the way down to the ground while they
fall.

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:41.960
If you pinwheel this too fast

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:43.260
they're gonna over speed them and breaks stuff

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:44.740
and you're gonna fall like that brick.

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:46.060
So here's the trick,

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.440
we know that the outside of the blades moves faster than the inside of the blade, right?!

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:53.500
and we also know that drag
is a function of velocity

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:58.180
because of this does is magic point along the blade
that it no longer acts like a pinwheel

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:59.780
it acts like a fan

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:03.079
the pilot can then adjust the collective
and determine how much of the blade he

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:06.459
wants to use a pinwheel and how much he
wants to use a fan

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:09.240
he feathers it and rides at all the way down to the ground

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:11.940
keeping the rotor system at just the right speed

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:14.860
not too fast and not too slow he keeps the blade running with

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:17.780
the pinwheel mode and he bleeds off the
extra rotational energy in the form of

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:20.220
lift which helps him slowly glide to
the ground.

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:24.150
This whole maneuver is called an auto
rotation and it's taught by helicopter

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:25.770
training pilots everywhere

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:29.330
Now I'd like to demonstrate an autorotation because you, you need to do some training right? yeah

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:31.030
we're going to talk to who? what's the guys name?

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:32.200
His name is Gerry Friesen

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:34.060
He actually trained me twenty five years ago,

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:36.200
he has around 16,000 flight hours

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:38.640
Destin: Good dream.
- and he has a...they say...

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:41.600
It takes 10,000 hours to become master of something

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:43.820
So Gerry is a master...

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:45.000
Destin: and a half
- and a half

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.000
It's awesome. Alright!

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:48.620
let's go get Smarter Every Day with
Gerry Friesen.

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:50.600
Are you Gerry?

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:51.200
Yeah!

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:53.160
I'm Destin. Nice to meet you. How you're doing?

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:55.720
If someone were to say helicopters fall like bricks

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:57.480
What it would be your input to the common man

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:00.260
what would you want the normal person to know about helicopters?

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:02.060
Well, I..I would like...

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:04.340
anyone to know that a helicopter glides

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:06.160
nicely like an airplane.

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:07.800
And the nice thing about the helicopter

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:09.980
It's a...instead of an airplane where...

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:12.520
where you force to touchdown probably at a minimum of...

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:13.880
fifty to sixty knots.

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:16.220
And the helicopter can touchdown at...

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:17.620
Ten knots!

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:18.820
So even safer than an airplane?

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:20.200
I would say you're safer.

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:21.360
and the reason is...

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:23.060
Ok, that makes sense because in order to glide

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:24.240
you have to be moving through the

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:26.100
air very fast or high rate of speed

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:28.160
but in a helicopter you could do it almost zero.

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:29.520
You pick an open spot,

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:32.080
an airplane going into that spot

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:34.600
it's gonna land at sixty and tumble

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:38.840
Right! and maybe hit a few trees that
helicopter going into that spot will

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:41.920
descend vertically for the last few feet known for...

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:46.380
momentum whatsoever and worst that'll happen maybe little clips of tree

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:48.380
That's amazing! provided that the pilot

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:52.240
manage the kinetic energy in its rotors system and balance it with its potential energy

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:56.300
in kind of balance that driving region
versus the driven region of the rotor system.

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:57.140
Exactly!

00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:58.340
That's amazing!

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:01.480
ok so here's what we're gonna do we're up
high and they were about to disconnect

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:04.900
the engine for the rotor system.  When we do that we're gonna start trading our

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:09.270
vertical potential energy for kinetic
energy in the rotor system so what

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:12.960
Jerry's doing now is he's spinning up the
rotor system and as we go down we have a

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:16.800
part of the rotor that's driving the
rotor because winds coming up to the

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:20.520
bottom and we have another part that's
being driven now that part is providing

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:25.800
drags what we're doing is as Gerry is
adjusting the collective he is trading

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:30.100
off the distance all the driving in the
driven that region of that rotors.

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:34.430
So we coming down he's got it spot up really
fast and right here at the bottom

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:35.470
he's gonna flare it

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:39.090
and when it flares it that trades off that kinetic energy in the system

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:39.880
into...

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:41.080
There we go

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:44.020
You hear that?

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:45.060
So...

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:46.860
We just made an autorotation

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:48.660
We skidded to a stop,

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:49.840
But we are alive

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:51.960
Thank you very much, really appreciated it, you're the man!

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:52.960
You're welcome.

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:53.900
How many hours you have?

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:55.680
A little over 16,000

00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:56.320
It's that all?

00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:57.120
That's all.

00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:58.820
maybe you'll figured it out how to do this one day

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:01.100
Yeah...practice practice

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:03.020
You can know the theory behind it

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:04.080
But you don't really understand how...

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:05.620
you do it until you do it yourself, right?

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:07.020
That yea...exactly

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:08.320
and just becomes a feel thing.

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:10.540
I hope you enjoyed this episode of Smarter Every Day

00:07:10.659 --> 00:07:14.069
I wanna say thank you to Neil deGrasse Tyson for agreeing to be the 'foil' for this video

00:07:14.069 --> 00:07:17.360
also want to say thanks to Bradley
freezin for taking up in his helicopter

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:20.539
he's got a really cool helicopter channel you should really check it out

00:07:20.539 --> 00:07:22.899
his dog flies with him, it's really fun.

00:07:22.899 --> 00:07:23.939
Also wanna say thanks to the sponsor

00:07:23.939 --> 00:07:25.300

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:30.290
many people get kiwicrates

00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:32.600
Therefore, I'm not gonna tell you about it myself,

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:33.980
I'm gonna let my kids do it

00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:36.500
Because their cuter, and probably gonna believe them more

00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:38.180
You can open your crates, go for it!

Echo!!

00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:41.460
Why'd you have to say the word "Echo" to get an echo?

00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:42.260
So at works.

00:08:42.420 --> 00:08:43.580
woohooo....

00:08:44.060 --> 00:08:46.320
I going to explore somewhere that nobodys else can get to...

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:48.280
That's what helicopters do for ya...

00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:55.440
I drink glacier water.

00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:03.940
[laugh]

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:05.520
Did you make it?

00:09:05.740 --> 00:09:06.700
I almost.

00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:07.960
You were very close

00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:09.640
And I broke mine!

00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:11.760
It'll be okay, give me five, good job!
