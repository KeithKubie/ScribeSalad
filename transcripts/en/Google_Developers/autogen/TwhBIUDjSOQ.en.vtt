differences from google summer of code
 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:47.580
differences from google summer of code
is that we are actually open to non

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590
is that we are actually open to non
 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:50.699

of our participants are not students and
 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:55.949
of our participants are not students and
also we have non-coding tasks in

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:55.959
also we have non-coding tasks in
 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:58.320
also we have non-coding tasks in
addition to coding tasks oh that's great

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:58.330
addition to coding tasks oh that's great
 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:01.020

foundation organized the program we

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780
foundation organized the program we
 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:06.960
foundation organized the program we
originally founded the program it was

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.970
originally founded the program it was
 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:09.930
originally founded the program it was
for the genome project and we found that

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940
for the genome project and we found that
 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:11.910
for the genome project and we found that
the program had such a big impact on our

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920
the program had such a big impact on our
 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.560
the program had such a big impact on our
project it was bringing so many

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:13.570
project it was bringing so many
 

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:16.380
project it was bringing so many
extraordinary women we went from having

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390
extraordinary women we went from having
 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:18.660
extraordinary women we went from having
as marina said four percent women at our

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:18.670
as marina said four percent women at our
 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:20.190
as marina said four percent women at our
annual conference which is called Gua

tech to having this year we recently had
 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:25.710
tech to having this year we recently had
eighteen percent which is often a

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720
eighteen percent which is often a
 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.420

statistic given as the number of women

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430
statistic given as the number of women
 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:29.880
statistic given as the number of women
in proprietary software and the the gap

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:29.890
in proprietary software and the the gap
 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:32.610
in proprietary software and the the gap
between free software and proprietary

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:32.620
between free software and proprietary
 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.190
between free software and proprietary
software was very wide in terms of how

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.200
software was very wide in terms of how
 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:36.750
software was very wide in terms of how
many women that were participating which

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760
many women that were participating which
 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:40.199
many women that were participating which
was really surprising so so we've had

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:40.209
was really surprising so so we've had
 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:42.720
was really surprising so so we've had
this this major change in a gnome and

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:42.730
this this major change in a gnome and
 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:44.520
this this major change in a gnome and
because it was so good for no we decided

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530
because it was so good for no we decided
 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:46.530
because it was so good for no we decided
we couldn't keep it to ourselves so what

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540
we couldn't keep it to ourselves so what
 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:48.449
we couldn't keep it to ourselves so what
we did was we opened it up to other free

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:48.459
we did was we opened it up to other free
 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:50.670
we did was we opened it up to other free
software projects who also were

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:50.680
software projects who also were
 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.259
software projects who also were
interested in trying to help solve this

00:03:52.259 --> 00:03:52.269
interested in trying to help solve this
 

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:54.600
interested in trying to help solve this
problem so we now have over 20 projects

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:54.610
problem so we now have over 20 projects
 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:57.090
problem so we now have over 20 projects

know I think it's it's it's several
 

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:19.159
know I think it's it's it's several
things one is that it's an

things one is that it's an
 

00:06:19.169 --> 00:06:20.900
things one is that it's an
acknowledgement that free software and

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:20.910
acknowledgement that free software and
 

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:22.820
acknowledgement that free software and
software in general need so much more

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:22.830
software in general need so much more
 

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:25.880
software in general need so much more
than just coding and having you know

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:25.890
than just coding and having you know
 

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:27.950

happening as well so I think it's it's

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:51.960
happening as well so I think it's it's
 

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:54.230
happening as well so I think it's it's
it's twofold it's valuing the non-coding

become a contributor to a free and open
source software project so just the

00:08:35.029 --> 00:08:35.039
source software project so just the
 

00:08:35.039 --> 00:08:37.040
source software project so just the
application process alone is really

00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:37.050
application process alone is really
 

00:08:37.050 --> 00:08:39.529
application process alone is really
valuable to go through and we do find

00:08:39.529 --> 00:08:39.539
valuable to go through and we do find
 

00:08:39.539 --> 00:08:40.880
valuable to go through and we do find
that women who go through the process

00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:40.890
that women who go through the process
 

00:08:40.890 --> 00:08:43.909
that women who go through the process
sometimes even if they didn't get the

sometimes even if they didn't get the
 

00:08:43.919 --> 00:08:45.260
sometimes even if they didn't get the
internship during the time that they

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:45.270
internship during the time that they
 

00:08:45.270 --> 00:08:46.790
internship during the time that they
applied if they stuck around and

00:08:46.790 --> 00:08:46.800
applied if they stuck around and
 

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:48.650
applied if they stuck around and
continued continue to contribute they

00:08:48.650 --> 00:08:48.660
continued continue to contribute they
 

00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:50.210
continued continue to contribute they
become a much stronger candidate for the

00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:52.550
become a much stronger candidate for the
next round and so even though you know

00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:52.560
next round and so even though you know
 

00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:55.130
next round and so even though you know
we get many more applicants than we can

00:08:55.130 --> 00:08:55.140
we get many more applicants than we can
 

00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:57.140
we get many more applicants than we can

00:10:25.410 --> 00:10:30.350
March 19 for google Summer of Code it's
March 21st so what would do for our maze

00:10:30.350 --> 00:10:30.360
March 21st so what would do for our maze
 

00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:32.270
March 21st so what would do for our maze
for all this round is that we parallels

00:10:32.270 --> 00:10:32.280
for all this round is that we parallels
 

00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:33.320
for all this round is that we parallels
the days for google summer of code

00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:33.330
the days for google summer of code
 

00:10:33.330 --> 00:10:35.150
the days for google summer of code
because part of what would like to do is

00:10:35.150 --> 00:10:35.160
because part of what would like to do is
