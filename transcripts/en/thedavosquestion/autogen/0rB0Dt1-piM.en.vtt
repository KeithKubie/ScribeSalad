and you know we we want Google to work
 

00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:27.490
and you know we we want Google to work
you know you don't want to go to Google

00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:27.500
you know you don't want to go to Google
 

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:29.440
you know you don't want to go to Google
and say oh sorry we're we're busy right

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:29.450
and say oh sorry we're we're busy right
 

00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:29.650
and say oh sorry we're we're busy right
now

00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:29.660
now
 

00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:33.010
now
that would be really bad you know we

00:07:33.010 --> 00:07:33.020
that would be really bad you know we
 

00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:35.290
that would be really bad you know we
were forced to be very practical about

00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:35.300
were forced to be very practical about
 

00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:37.930
were forced to be very practical about
that and so we've had you know we've had

00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:37.940
that and so we've had you know we've had
 

00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:39.940
that and so we've had you know we've had
a team going around building data

00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:39.950
a team going around building data
 

00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:42.700
a team going around building data
centers and finding energy and so on and

00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:42.710
centers and finding energy and so on and
 

00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:45.250
centers and finding energy and so on and
so we and doing that worldwide those who

00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:45.260
so we and doing that worldwide those who
 

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:47.080
so we and doing that worldwide those who
want our services to be fast everywhere

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:47.090
want our services to be fast everywhere
 

00:07:47.090 --> 00:07:49.870
want our services to be fast everywhere
and because of that are we really

00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:49.880
and because of that are we really
 

00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:51.940
and because of that are we really
noticed well we're getting you know we

00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:51.950
noticed well we're getting you know we
 

00:07:51.950 --> 00:07:53.440
noticed well we're getting you know we
have some facilities for example that

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:53.450
have some facilities for example that
 

00:07:53.450 --> 00:07:56.200
have some facilities for example that
are close to dams and so on but a lot of

00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:56.210
are close to dams and so on but a lot of
 

00:07:56.210 --> 00:07:57.670
are close to dams and so on but a lot of
times we're really displacing somebody

00:07:57.670 --> 00:07:57.680
times we're really displacing somebody
 

00:07:57.680 --> 00:07:59.500
times we're really displacing somebody
else who would use that energy it's not

00:07:59.500 --> 00:07:59.510
else who would use that energy it's not
 

00:07:59.510 --> 00:08:01.300
else who would use that energy it's not

maybe you know there's not quite as much

00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:05.630
maybe you know there's not quite as much
 

00:08:05.630 --> 00:08:07.000
maybe you know there's not quite as much

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:07.010
transmission as there would have been
 

00:08:07.010 --> 00:08:10.060
transmission as there would have been
but it's not that that's such a green

00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:10.070
but it's not that that's such a green
 

00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:12.340
but it's not that that's such a green
way of doing it and you know many places

00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:12.350
way of doing it and you know many places
 

00:08:12.350 --> 00:08:14.650
way of doing it and you know many places
you know you basically see that you know

00:08:14.650 --> 00:08:14.660
you know you basically see that you know
 

00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:16.000
you know you basically see that you know
we would see and buying a lot of

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:16.010
we would see and buying a lot of
 

00:08:16.010 --> 00:08:18.070
we would see and buying a lot of
electricity you know where you get a

00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:18.080
electricity you know where you get a

business side of our company is saying

00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:22.970
business side of our company is saying
 

00:08:22.970 --> 00:08:24.820
business side of our company is saying
well you know let's buy the cheap

00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:24.830
well you know let's buy the cheap
 

00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:26.380
well you know let's buy the cheap
electricity and make sure you know a

00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:26.390
electricity and make sure you know a
 

00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:29.020
electricity and make sure you know a
bottom line is good and all that and you

00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:29.030
bottom line is good and all that and you
 

00:08:29.030 --> 00:08:30.400
bottom line is good and all that and you
know we're kind of looking this isn't

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:30.410
know we're kind of looking this isn't
 

00:08:30.410 --> 00:08:31.000
know we're kind of looking this isn't
good right

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:31.010
good right
 

00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:32.260
good right
computers are using more and more

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:32.270
computers are using more and more
 

00:08:32.270 --> 00:08:33.850
computers are using more and more
electricity people are doing more things

00:08:33.850 --> 00:08:33.860
electricity people are doing more things
 

00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:36.760
electricity people are doing more things
with them and actually the cost of your

00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:36.770
with them and actually the cost of your
 

00:08:36.770 --> 00:08:39.490
with them and actually the cost of your
computing that's electricity is going up

00:08:39.490 --> 00:08:39.500
computing that's electricity is going up
 

00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:41.589
computing that's electricity is going up
as a percentage well it's actually

00:08:41.589 --> 00:08:41.599
as a percentage well it's actually
 

00:08:41.599 --> 00:08:43.329

pretty significant might even approach

00:08:43.329 --> 00:08:43.339
pretty significant might even approach
 

00:08:43.339 --> 00:08:47.079
pretty significant might even approach
the cost of the computers themselves and

00:08:47.079 --> 00:08:47.089
the cost of the computers themselves and
 

00:08:47.089 --> 00:08:49.420
the cost of the computers themselves and
because of that we said well why why

00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:49.430
because of that we said well why why
 

00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:51.190
because of that we said well why why
aren't we making renewable energy

00:08:51.190 --> 00:08:51.200
aren't we making renewable energy
 

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:52.150
aren't we making renewable energy
cheaper then you

00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:52.160
cheaper then you
 

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:53.439
cheaper then you
got a phone call that would be the easy

00:08:53.439 --> 00:08:53.449
got a phone call that would be the easy
 

00:08:53.449 --> 00:08:55.629
got a phone call that would be the easy
decision to make say we're gonna get a

00:08:55.629 --> 00:08:55.639
decision to make say we're gonna get a
 

00:08:55.639 --> 00:08:58.569
decision to make say we're gonna get a
cheaply an you know it's going to be

00:08:58.569 --> 00:08:58.579
cheaply an you know it's going to be
 

00:08:58.579 --> 00:09:01.990
cheaply an you know it's going to be
green and there's tons of startups in

00:09:01.990 --> 00:09:02.000
green and there's tons of startups in
 

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.850
green and there's tons of startups in
the space we've invested in some we have

00:09:03.850 --> 00:09:03.860
the space we've invested in some we have
 

00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:06.009
the space we've invested in some we have
friends in many different ones and the

00:09:06.009 --> 00:09:06.019
friends in many different ones and the
 

00:09:06.019 --> 00:09:08.040
friends in many different ones and the
problem we had is that all the startups

00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:08.050
problem we had is that all the startups
 

00:09:08.050 --> 00:09:10.900
problem we had is that all the startups
they can basically do have an incredible

00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:10.910
they can basically do have an incredible
 

00:09:10.910 --> 00:09:12.999
they can basically do have an incredible
business making electricity at ten cents

00:09:12.999 --> 00:09:13.009
business making electricity at ten cents
 

00:09:13.009 --> 00:09:15.939
business making electricity at ten cents
a kilowatt hour and the reason is

00:09:15.939 --> 00:09:15.949
a kilowatt hour and the reason is
 

00:09:15.949 --> 00:09:17.499
a kilowatt hour and the reason is
there's tremendous demand for renewable

00:09:17.499 --> 00:09:17.509
there's tremendous demand for renewable
 

00:09:17.509 --> 00:09:19.119
there's tremendous demand for renewable
energy and we would buy it at a higher

00:09:19.119 --> 00:09:19.129
energy and we would buy it at a higher
 

00:09:19.129 --> 00:09:22.569
energy and we would buy it at a higher
price but you know you you're not going

00:09:22.569 --> 00:09:22.579
price but you know you you're not going
 

00:09:22.579 --> 00:09:25.030
price but you know you you're not going
to fundamentally change the game unless

00:09:25.030 --> 00:09:25.040
to fundamentally change the game unless
 

00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:27.999
to fundamentally change the game unless
the it's cheaper than coal and the

00:09:27.999 --> 00:09:28.009
the it's cheaper than coal and the
 

00:09:28.009 --> 00:09:29.350
the it's cheaper than coal and the
problem for a start-up you know they're

00:09:29.350 --> 00:09:29.360
problem for a start-up you know they're
 

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:30.939
problem for a start-up you know they're
looking at it well we want to succeed we

00:09:30.939 --> 00:09:30.949
looking at it well we want to succeed we
 

00:09:30.949 --> 00:09:33.280
looking at it well we want to succeed we
can make it a $0.10 succeed but we

00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:33.290
can make it a $0.10 succeed but we
 

00:09:33.290 --> 00:09:34.990
can make it a $0.10 succeed but we
really need to make it at three cents to

00:09:34.990 --> 00:09:35.000
really need to make it at three cents to
 

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.569
really need to make it at three cents to
really change the world and we we want

00:09:37.569 --> 00:09:37.579
really change the world and we we want
 

00:09:37.579 --> 00:09:39.579
really change the world and we we want
those projects that could be three cents

00:09:39.579 --> 00:09:39.589
those projects that could be three cents
 

00:09:39.589 --> 00:09:41.949
those projects that could be three cents
to start right now and we're willing to

00:09:41.949 --> 00:09:41.959
to start right now and we're willing to
 

00:09:41.959 --> 00:09:43.509
to start right now and we're willing to
take you know the risks on those things

00:09:43.509 --> 00:09:43.519
take you know the risks on those things
 

00:09:43.519 --> 00:09:44.949
take you know the risks on those things
and obviously if you succeed at one of

00:09:44.949 --> 00:09:44.959
and obviously if you succeed at one of
 

00:09:44.959 --> 00:09:45.910
and obviously if you succeed at one of
those things you're gonna have a great

00:09:45.910 --> 00:09:45.920
those things you're gonna have a great
 

00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:48.759
those things you're gonna have a great
business well but it's very rational for

00:09:48.759 --> 00:09:48.769
business well but it's very rational for
 

00:09:48.769 --> 00:09:50.829
business well but it's very rational for
a start-up to say we're not going to

00:09:50.829 --> 00:09:50.839
a start-up to say we're not going to
 

00:09:50.839 --> 00:09:52.269
a start-up to say we're not going to
take that risk we're gonna take you know

00:09:52.269 --> 00:09:52.279
take that risk we're gonna take you know
 

00:09:52.279 --> 00:09:53.619
take that risk we're gonna take you know
we're gonna produce it at the ten cents

00:09:53.619 --> 00:09:53.629
we're gonna produce it at the ten cents
 

00:09:53.629 --> 00:09:55.689
we're gonna produce it at the ten cents
and we're gonna have a great business

00:09:55.689 --> 00:09:55.699
and we're gonna have a great business
 

00:09:55.699 --> 00:09:57.429
and we're gonna have a great business
and you know we want our business to

00:09:57.429 --> 00:09:57.439
and you know we want our business to
 

00:09:57.439 --> 00:09:59.889
and you know we want our business to
grow slowly and our primary goal is not

00:09:59.889 --> 00:09:59.899
grow slowly and our primary goal is not
 

00:09:59.899 --> 00:10:00.910
grow slowly and our primary goal is not
to fix the world

00:10:00.910 --> 00:10:00.920
to fix the world
 

00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:03.160
to fix the world
right whereas we have a little bit of a

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:03.170
right whereas we have a little bit of a
 

00:10:03.170 --> 00:10:05.710
right whereas we have a little bit of a
luxury of driving some of those projects

00:10:05.710 --> 00:10:05.720
luxury of driving some of those projects
 

00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:07.569
luxury of driving some of those projects
forward so I think we saw that there

00:10:07.569 --> 00:10:07.579
forward so I think we saw that there
 

00:10:07.579 --> 00:10:09.220
forward so I think we saw that there
wasn't enough investment in some of

00:10:09.220 --> 00:10:09.230
wasn't enough investment in some of
 

00:10:09.230 --> 00:10:11.740
wasn't enough investment in some of
those things and we also saw how we

00:10:11.740 --> 00:10:11.750
those things and we also saw how we
 

00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:14.019
those things and we also saw how we
talked to enough people that you know if

00:10:14.019 --> 00:10:14.029
talked to enough people that you know if
 

00:10:14.029 --> 00:10:15.790
talked to enough people that you know if
you really push the startups and the

00:10:15.790 --> 00:10:15.800
you really push the startups and the
 

00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:17.050
you really push the startups and the
people who are really smart on these

00:10:17.050 --> 00:10:17.060
people who are really smart on these
 

00:10:17.060 --> 00:10:19.600
people who are really smart on these
things say well do you guys have a way

00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:19.610
things say well do you guys have a way
 

00:10:19.610 --> 00:10:21.759
things say well do you guys have a way
of doing it at three cents they say yeah

00:10:21.759 --> 00:10:21.769
of doing it at three cents they say yeah
 

00:10:21.769 --> 00:10:23.439
of doing it at three cents they say yeah
we do it a little bit modestly higher

00:10:23.439 --> 00:10:23.449
we do it a little bit modestly higher
 

00:10:23.449 --> 00:10:25.809
we do it a little bit modestly higher
risk however we have a clear path to get

00:10:25.809 --> 00:10:25.819
risk however we have a clear path to get
 

00:10:25.819 --> 00:10:26.889
risk however we have a clear path to get
there and we're like well why don't we

00:10:26.889 --> 00:10:26.899
there and we're like well why don't we
 

00:10:26.899 --> 00:10:28.809
there and we're like well why don't we
get going on that now what do you need

00:10:28.809 --> 00:10:28.819
get going on that now what do you need
 

00:10:28.819 --> 00:10:30.490
get going on that now what do you need
you know you need some people and it's a

00:10:30.490 --> 00:10:30.500
you know you need some people and it's a
 

00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:32.170
you know you need some people and it's a
little bit of money and so on that's

00:10:32.170 --> 00:10:32.180
little bit of money and so on that's
 

00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:35.319
little bit of money and so on that's
relatively modest resource so you tell

00:10:35.319 --> 00:10:35.329
relatively modest resource so you tell
 

00:10:35.329 --> 00:10:37.329
relatively modest resource so you tell
us a little bit about where the

they're intermittent power you know
 

00:11:51.650 --> 00:11:53.500
they're intermittent power you know
since you can't just rely on the wind

00:16:32.759 --> 00:16:32.769
between doing like web search and things
 

00:16:32.769 --> 00:16:35.730
between doing like web search and things
like that and the energy business or at

00:16:35.730 --> 00:16:35.740
like that and the energy business or at

demonstrate the cost-effectiveness or
your product and that probably means

00:16:49.139 --> 00:16:49.149
your product and that probably means
 

00:16:49.149 --> 00:16:50.850

have to make and takes a lot of capital
 

00:16:56.649 --> 00:17:00.720
have to make and takes a lot of capital
and that's we feel that this maturation

00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:00.730
and that's we feel that this maturation
 

00:17:00.730 --> 00:17:02.850
and that's we feel that this maturation
or a company that we actually have you

know a fair amount of capital and we're
 

00:17:04.780 --> 00:17:06.899
know a fair amount of capital and we're
willing to probably be riskier with it

00:17:06.899 --> 00:17:06.909
willing to probably be riskier with it
 

00:17:06.909 --> 00:17:09.480

than other companies like we can take a
 

00:17:09.490 --> 00:17:12.600
than other companies like we can take a
chance on a data center I think that

00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:12.610
chance on a data center I think that
 

00:17:12.610 --> 00:17:14.370
chance on a data center I think that
puts us in the position to do things

00:17:14.370 --> 00:17:14.380

the reaction of your shareholders I mean
 

00:17:22.839 --> 00:17:26.010
the reaction of your shareholders I mean
I think it's been fine I think we stated

hundreds and millions of dollars that
would be there were generate positive

00:17:33.180 --> 00:17:33.190
would be there were generate positive
 

00:17:33.190 --> 00:17:35.669
would be there were generate positive
returns and I think we said just what

00:17:35.669 --> 00:17:35.679
returns and I think we said just what
 

00:17:35.679 --> 00:17:37.200

you with the variability how there's

00:24:55.450 --> 00:24:55.460
you with the variability how there's
 

00:24:55.460 --> 00:24:56.740
you with the variability how there's
been studies that show for example

00:24:56.740 --> 00:24:56.750
been studies that show for example
 

00:24:56.750 --> 00:24:59.020
been studies that show for example
Europe could get 90 percent of their

00:24:59.020 --> 00:24:59.030
Europe could get 90 percent of their
 

00:24:59.030 --> 00:25:01.480
Europe could get 90 percent of their
electricity from wind at a cost equal to

00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:01.490
electricity from wind at a cost equal to
 

00:25:01.490 --> 00:25:06.490
electricity from wind at a cost equal to
coal 90 percent just from wind at same

00:25:06.490 --> 00:25:06.500
coal 90 percent just from wind at same
 

00:25:06.500 --> 00:25:07.810
coal 90 percent just from wind at same
cost as coal if they had better

00:25:07.810 --> 00:25:07.820
cost as coal if they had better
 

00:25:07.820 --> 00:25:11.260
cost as coal if they had better
transmission now it's kind of terrible

00:25:11.260 --> 00:25:11.270
transmission now it's kind of terrible
 

00:25:11.270 --> 00:25:12.880
transmission now it's kind of terrible
that there's nobody working on that

00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:12.890
that there's nobody working on that
 

00:25:12.890 --> 00:25:14.500
that there's nobody working on that
right as far as I could tell or very

00:25:14.500 --> 00:25:14.510
right as far as I could tell or very
 

00:25:14.510 --> 00:25:17.110
right as far as I could tell or very
very few people and even if we did have

00:25:17.110 --> 00:25:17.120
very few people and even if we did have
 

00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:18.670
very few people and even if we did have
technologies that were better for the

00:25:18.670 --> 00:25:18.680
technologies that were better for the
 

00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:20.230
technologies that were better for the
transmission the ones we have are

00:25:20.230 --> 00:25:20.240
transmission the ones we have are
 

00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:21.760
transmission the ones we have are
probably good enough to you know solve

00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:21.770
probably good enough to you know solve
 

00:25:21.770 --> 00:25:24.070
probably good enough to you know solve
Europe's energy needs but the odds that

00:25:24.070 --> 00:25:24.080
Europe's energy needs but the odds that
 

00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:25.750
Europe's energy needs but the odds that
they'll get deployed you know across a

00:25:25.750 --> 00:25:25.760
they'll get deployed you know across a
 

00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:28.060
they'll get deployed you know across a
wide area like that are probably close

00:25:28.060 --> 00:25:28.070
wide area like that are probably close
 

00:25:28.070 --> 00:25:30.610
wide area like that are probably close
to zero without somebody like a US

00:25:30.610 --> 00:25:30.620
to zero without somebody like a US
 

00:25:30.620 --> 00:25:32.830

president or or somebody powerful saying

00:25:32.830 --> 00:25:32.840
president or or somebody powerful saying
 

00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:34.450
president or or somebody powerful saying
we're gonna build really good

00:25:34.450 --> 00:25:34.460
we're gonna build really good
 

00:25:34.460 --> 00:25:36.520
we're gonna build really good
transmission so that we can have better

00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:36.530
transmission so that we can have better
 

00:25:36.530 --> 00:25:38.530
transmission so that we can have better
renewable energy and solve some of these

00:25:38.530 --> 00:25:38.540
renewable energy and solve some of these
 

00:25:38.540 --> 00:25:40.420
renewable energy and solve some of these
problems give us kind of interstate

00:25:40.420 --> 00:25:40.430
problems give us kind of interstate
 

00:25:40.430 --> 00:25:42.460
problems give us kind of interstate
highway system for the grid yeah right

00:25:42.460 --> 00:25:42.470
highway system for the grid yeah right
 

00:25:42.470 --> 00:25:43.930
highway system for the grid yeah right
now you know if you order a transformer

00:25:43.930 --> 00:25:43.940
now you know if you order a transformer
 

00:25:43.940 --> 00:25:45.970
now you know if you order a transformer
at three years as a expedited delivery

00:25:45.970 --> 00:25:45.980
at three years as a expedited delivery
 

00:25:45.980 --> 00:25:48.970
at three years as a expedited delivery
hmm we know that we order transformers

00:25:48.970 --> 00:25:48.980
hmm we know that we order transformers
 

00:25:48.980 --> 00:25:51.820
hmm we know that we order transformers
so I think you know in that kind of

00:25:51.820 --> 00:25:51.830
so I think you know in that kind of
 

00:25:51.830 --> 00:25:53.800
so I think you know in that kind of
environment we're not going to see very

00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:53.810
environment we're not going to see very
 

00:25:53.810 --> 00:25:56.020
environment we're not going to see very
fast progress on solving these energy

00:25:56.020 --> 00:25:56.030
fast progress on solving these energy
 

00:25:56.030 --> 00:25:56.410
fast progress on solving these energy
issues

00:25:56.410 --> 00:25:56.420
issues
 

00:25:56.420 --> 00:25:58.570
issues
so I'd say transmission we should have

00:25:58.570 --> 00:25:58.580
so I'd say transmission we should have
 

00:25:58.580 --> 00:26:00.460
so I'd say transmission we should have
we should just assume that we're going

00:26:00.460 --> 00:26:00.470
we should just assume that we're going
 

00:26:00.470 --> 00:26:02.620
we should just assume that we're going
to need better transmission it'd be nice

00:26:02.620 --> 00:26:02.630
to need better transmission it'd be nice
 

00:26:02.630 --> 00:26:04.660
to need better transmission it'd be nice
to you know use more energy than we use

00:26:04.660 --> 00:26:04.670
to you know use more energy than we use
 

00:26:04.670 --> 00:26:06.730
to you know use more energy than we use
now and how to do renewable and we're

00:26:06.730 --> 00:26:06.740
now and how to do renewable and we're
 

00:26:06.740 --> 00:26:07.930
now and how to do renewable and we're
not gonna get any of those things unless

00:26:07.930 --> 00:26:07.940
not gonna get any of those things unless
 

00:26:07.940 --> 00:26:09.310
not gonna get any of those things unless
we have better transmission and that's

00:26:09.310 --> 00:26:09.320
we have better transmission and that's
 

00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:11.620
we have better transmission and that's
got to be a governmental issue so you

00:26:11.620 --> 00:26:11.630
got to be a governmental issue so you
 

00:26:11.630 --> 00:26:13.120
got to be a governmental issue so you
get other than transmission what would

00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:13.130
get other than transmission what would
 

00:26:13.130 --> 00:26:13.960
get other than transmission what would
be yours

00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:13.970
be yours
 

00:26:13.970 --> 00:26:15.520
be yours
what would what do you think the next

00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:15.530
what would what do you think the next
 

00:26:15.530 --> 00:26:16.750
what would what do you think the next
president could do that would be most

00:26:16.750 --> 00:26:16.760
president could do that would be most
 

00:26:16.760 --> 00:26:21.010
president could do that would be most
helpful I think that we want to be on an

00:26:21.010 --> 00:26:21.020
helpful I think that we want to be on an
 

00:26:21.020 --> 00:26:23.170
helpful I think that we want to be on an
equal playing field between renewables

00:26:23.170 --> 00:26:23.180
equal playing field between renewables
 

00:26:23.180 --> 00:26:28.390
equal playing field between renewables
and and coal and dirty energy I think

00:26:28.390 --> 00:26:28.400
and and coal and dirty energy I think
 

00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:29.830
and and coal and dirty energy I think
people kind of under appreciate right

00:26:29.830 --> 00:26:29.840
people kind of under appreciate right
 

00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:31.690
people kind of under appreciate right
now that I think like well all these

00:26:31.690 --> 00:26:31.700
now that I think like well all these
 

00:26:31.700 --> 00:26:33.460
now that I think like well all these
renewables want all these subsidies the

00:26:33.460 --> 00:26:33.470
renewables want all these subsidies the
 

00:26:33.470 --> 00:26:36.250
renewables want all these subsidies the
taxes on the dirty technologies but the

00:26:36.250 --> 00:26:36.260
taxes on the dirty technologies but the
 

00:26:36.260 --> 00:26:37.930
taxes on the dirty technologies but the
situation right now is very opposite of

00:26:37.930 --> 00:26:37.940
situation right now is very opposite of
 

00:26:37.940 --> 00:26:41.440
situation right now is very opposite of
that if you just look at Larry mentioned

00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:41.450
that if you just look at Larry mentioned

a lot of our transportation if you look

00:26:49.780 --> 00:26:49.790
a lot of our transportation if you look
 

00:26:49.790 --> 00:26:51.880
a lot of our transportation if you look
at well the Iraq war which whether you

00:26:51.880 --> 00:26:51.890
at well the Iraq war which whether you

Saddam had all that military might was
because of the oil money that we paid if

00:27:01.630 --> 00:27:01.640
because of the oil money that we paid if

because of the oil money that we paid if
you look at things like the cost you put

00:27:04.900 --> 00:27:04.910
you look at things like the cost you put
 

00:27:04.910 --> 00:27:06.700
you look at things like the cost you put
it on renewables the tariffs on

it's true that car companies do all the
 

00:27:37.370 --> 00:27:39.310
it's true that car companies do all the
crash testing on their gas cars but they

00:27:39.310 --> 00:27:39.320
crash testing on their gas cars but they
 

00:27:39.320 --> 00:27:40.570
crash testing on their gas cars but they
don't know the motorcycles and you know

don't know the motorcycles and you know
the motorcycles are unsafe so why not a

makes sense there and really just
growing that and making it happen and I

00:31:47.260 --> 00:31:47.270
growing that and making it happen and I
 

00:31:47.270 --> 00:31:49.420
growing that and making it happen and I
do think that you know having a lot of

00:31:49.420 --> 00:31:49.430
do think that you know having a lot of
 

00:31:49.430 --> 00:31:51.310
do think that you know having a lot of
enterprises I mean there's there's a lot

00:31:51.310 --> 00:31:51.320
enterprises I mean there's there's a lot
 

00:31:51.320 --> 00:31:53.740
enterprises I mean there's there's a lot
of things going on in these places but

00:31:53.740 --> 00:31:53.750
of things going on in these places but
 

00:31:53.750 --> 00:31:55.210
of things going on in these places but
having a little bit of organized

00:31:55.210 --> 00:31:55.220
having a little bit of organized
 

00:31:55.220 --> 00:31:58.600
having a little bit of organized
enterprises having you know some of the

00:31:58.600 --> 00:31:58.610
enterprises having you know some of the
 

00:31:58.610 --> 00:32:00.280
enterprises having you know some of the
things that we've we've learned how to

00:32:00.280 --> 00:32:00.290
things that we've we've learned how to
 

00:32:00.290 --> 00:32:02.950
things that we've we've learned how to
do just getting that idea into people's

00:32:02.950 --> 00:32:02.960
do just getting that idea into people's
 

00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:05.110
do just getting that idea into people's
heads is really important like you you

00:32:05.110 --> 00:32:05.120
heads is really important like you you
 

00:32:05.120 --> 00:32:06.220
heads is really important like you you
know you go to these places and you're

00:32:06.220 --> 00:32:06.230
know you go to these places and you're
 

00:32:06.230 --> 00:32:07.690
know you go to these places and you're
like well they don't have any debt

00:32:07.690 --> 00:32:07.700
like well they don't have any debt
 

00:32:07.700 --> 00:32:10.360
like well they don't have any debt
financing you know I was in Ghana for

00:32:10.360 --> 00:32:10.370
financing you know I was in Ghana for
 

00:32:10.370 --> 00:32:11.590
financing you know I was in Ghana for
his Oh personally and they don't have

00:32:11.590 --> 00:32:11.600
his Oh personally and they don't have
 

00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:13.740
his Oh personally and they don't have
any debt financing for houses really

00:32:13.740 --> 00:32:13.750
any debt financing for houses really
 

00:32:13.750 --> 00:32:16.180
any debt financing for houses really
you're like well no wonder it's hard for

00:32:16.180 --> 00:32:16.190
you're like well no wonder it's hard for
 

00:32:16.190 --> 00:32:17.410
you're like well no wonder it's hard for
people to buy houses there's no way to

00:32:17.410 --> 00:32:17.420
people to buy houses there's no way to
 

00:32:17.420 --> 00:32:19.570
people to buy houses there's no way to
borrow money to buy a house can't secure

00:32:19.570 --> 00:32:19.580
borrow money to buy a house can't secure
 

00:32:19.580 --> 00:32:21.550
borrow money to buy a house can't secure
it right we've discovered that's an

00:32:21.550 --> 00:32:21.560
it right we've discovered that's an
 

00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:23.590
it right we've discovered that's an
important thing right and so sometimes

00:32:23.590 --> 00:32:23.600
important thing right and so sometimes
 

00:32:23.600 --> 00:32:26.470
important thing right and so sometimes
just getting that idea and and then the

00:32:26.470 --> 00:32:26.480
just getting that idea and and then the
 

00:32:26.480 --> 00:32:28.000
just getting that idea and and then the
people they're obviously very capable

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:28.010
people they're obviously very capable
 

00:32:28.010 --> 00:32:29.530
people they're obviously very capable
and they can really run with those

00:32:29.530 --> 00:32:29.540
and they can really run with those
 

00:32:29.540 --> 00:32:32.470
and they can really run with those
things once they once people know know

00:32:32.470 --> 00:32:32.480
things once they once people know know
 

00:32:32.480 --> 00:32:34.480
things once they once people know know
about that and know so when you when you

00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:34.490
about that and know so when you when you
 

00:32:34.490 --> 00:32:35.890
about that and know so when you when you
you know made aware of a problem like

00:32:35.890 --> 00:32:35.900
you know made aware of a problem like
 

00:32:35.900 --> 00:32:38.380
you know made aware of a problem like
that you then call up Larry and say hey

00:32:38.380 --> 00:32:38.390
that you then call up Larry and say hey
 

00:32:38.390 --> 00:32:40.980
that you then call up Larry and say hey
you know is there some way we can get

00:32:40.980 --> 00:32:40.990
you know is there some way we can get
 

00:32:40.990 --> 00:32:43.720
you know is there some way we can get
either financing to local banks or start

00:32:43.720 --> 00:32:43.730
either financing to local banks or start
 

00:32:43.730 --> 00:32:45.550
either financing to local banks or start
our own or what do you do with an idea

00:32:45.550 --> 00:32:45.560
our own or what do you do with an idea
 

00:32:45.560 --> 00:32:47.500
our own or what do you do with an idea
like that I mean I think we just try to

00:32:47.500 --> 00:32:47.510
like that I mean I think we just try to
 

00:32:47.510 --> 00:32:49.870
like that I mean I think we just try to
talk about them that's not I mean I

00:32:49.870 --> 00:32:49.880
talk about them that's not I mean I
 

00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:51.550
talk about them that's not I mean I
think again this these are the problems

00:32:51.550 --> 00:32:51.560
think again this these are the problems
 

00:32:51.560 --> 00:32:52.990
think again this these are the problems
that are really hard that haven't been

00:32:52.990 --> 00:32:53.000
that are really hard that haven't been
 

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:54.430
that are really hard that haven't been
solved and a lot of people have been

00:32:54.430 --> 00:32:54.440
solved and a lot of people have been
 

00:32:54.440 --> 00:32:56.260
solved and a lot of people have been
working on them and so there's usually

00:32:56.260 --> 00:32:56.270
working on them and so there's usually
 

00:32:56.270 --> 00:32:58.030
working on them and so there's usually
you know there's usually ten different

00:32:58.030 --> 00:32:58.040
you know there's usually ten different
 

00:32:58.040 --> 00:32:59.410
you know there's usually ten different
things standing in your way you know you

00:32:59.410 --> 00:32:59.420
things standing in your way you know you
 

00:32:59.420 --> 00:33:02.470
things standing in your way you know you
don't have a body of law like I don't

00:33:02.470 --> 00:33:02.480
don't have a body of law like I don't
 

00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:04.060
don't have a body of law like I don't
think they're way they do land ownership

00:33:04.060 --> 00:33:04.070
think they're way they do land ownership
 

00:33:04.070 --> 00:33:04.770
think they're way they do land ownership
there

00:33:04.770 --> 00:33:04.780
there
 

00:33:04.780 --> 00:33:06.210
there
or a lot of these countries you know you

00:33:06.210 --> 00:33:06.220
or a lot of these countries you know you
 

00:33:06.220 --> 00:33:07.890
or a lot of these countries you know you
don't you don't really know who owns the

00:33:07.890 --> 00:33:07.900
don't you don't really know who owns the
 

00:33:07.900 --> 00:33:09.600
don't you don't really know who owns the
land or you don't have clear titles it's

00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:09.610
land or you don't have clear titles it's
 

00:33:09.610 --> 00:33:12.420
land or you don't have clear titles it's
hard to have that based on that and so

00:33:12.420 --> 00:33:12.430
hard to have that based on that and so
 

00:33:12.430 --> 00:33:13.950
hard to have that based on that and so
you know you just run into you know the

00:33:13.950 --> 00:33:13.960
you know you just run into you know the
 

00:33:13.960 --> 00:33:15.270
you know you just run into you know the
reason why it's not solved is because

00:33:15.270 --> 00:33:15.280
reason why it's not solved is because
 

00:33:15.280 --> 00:33:16.860
reason why it's not solved is because
there's ten things that need to be done

00:33:16.860 --> 00:33:16.870
there's ten things that need to be done
 

00:33:16.870 --> 00:33:18.510
there's ten things that need to be done
that doesn't mean you shouldn't try to

00:33:18.510 --> 00:33:18.520
that doesn't mean you shouldn't try to
 

00:33:18.520 --> 00:33:21.360
that doesn't mean you shouldn't try to
do those things right mmm Sergey talk

00:33:21.360 --> 00:33:21.370
do those things right mmm Sergey talk
 

00:33:21.370 --> 00:33:25.110
do those things right mmm Sergey talk
about what you've learned from China and

00:33:25.110 --> 00:33:25.120
about what you've learned from China and
 

00:33:25.120 --> 00:33:27.810
about what you've learned from China and
India in the energy space you obviously

00:33:27.810 --> 00:33:27.820
India in the energy space you obviously
 

00:33:27.820 --> 00:33:30.780
India in the energy space you obviously
compete you know in China in the field

00:33:30.780 --> 00:33:30.790
compete you know in China in the field
 

00:33:30.790 --> 00:33:32.580
compete you know in China in the field
of search what do you see going on there

00:33:32.580 --> 00:33:32.590
of search what do you see going on there
 

00:33:32.590 --> 00:33:35.100
of search what do you see going on there
that excites your or not about in the

00:33:35.100 --> 00:33:35.110
that excites your or not about in the
 

00:33:35.110 --> 00:33:38.010
that excites your or not about in the
energy field well I think primarily in

00:33:38.010 --> 00:33:38.020
energy field well I think primarily in
 

00:33:38.020 --> 00:33:40.110
energy field well I think primarily in
China and what was stressed out about

00:33:40.110 --> 00:33:40.120
China and what was stressed out about
 

00:33:40.120 --> 00:33:42.180
China and what was stressed out about
the energy space I mean the number of

00:33:42.180 --> 00:33:42.190
the energy space I mean the number of
 

00:33:42.190 --> 00:33:44.610
the energy space I mean the number of
coal plants that are going up there I

00:33:44.610 --> 00:33:44.620
coal plants that are going up there I
 

00:33:44.620 --> 00:33:46.710
coal plants that are going up there I
mean that's that's gonna be a really big

00:33:46.710 --> 00:33:46.720
mean that's that's gonna be a really big
 

00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:49.380
mean that's that's gonna be a really big
challenge I think it is important for us

00:33:49.380 --> 00:33:49.390
challenge I think it is important for us
 

00:33:49.390 --> 00:33:52.050
challenge I think it is important for us
to solve the problem in the u.s. kind of

00:33:52.050 --> 00:33:52.060
to solve the problem in the u.s. kind of
 

00:33:52.060 --> 00:33:53.880
to solve the problem in the u.s. kind of
unilaterally and first the head of you

00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:53.890
unilaterally and first the head of you
 

00:33:53.890 --> 00:33:56.000
unilaterally and first the head of you
know pushing the developing countries

00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:56.010
know pushing the developing countries
 

00:33:56.010 --> 00:33:58.350
know pushing the developing countries
but I do think that we need to do it

00:33:58.350 --> 00:33:58.360
but I do think that we need to do it
 

00:33:58.360 --> 00:34:01.920
but I do think that we need to do it
quickly before it's it's too late in

00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:01.930
quickly before it's it's too late in
 

00:34:01.930 --> 00:34:05.130
quickly before it's it's too late in
those other countries and I think

00:34:05.130 --> 00:34:05.140
those other countries and I think
 

00:34:05.140 --> 00:34:07.740
those other countries and I think
there's a lot of reason for hope there

00:34:07.740 --> 00:34:07.750
there's a lot of reason for hope there
 

00:34:07.750 --> 00:34:10.080
there's a lot of reason for hope there
too if I'm going to drift a little bit

00:34:10.080 --> 00:34:10.090

their yak which are wandering around far

00:34:33.780 --> 00:34:33.790
their yak which are wandering around far
 

00:34:33.790 --> 00:34:38.100
their yak which are wandering around far
away and they only had one piece of

00:34:38.100 --> 00:34:38.110
away and they only had one piece of
 

00:34:38.110 --> 00:34:40.290
away and they only had one piece of
technology which is well - they had a

00:34:40.290 --> 00:34:40.300
technology which is well - they had a
 

00:34:40.300 --> 00:34:44.280
technology which is well - they had a
solar cell and an LED light it was the

00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:44.290
solar cell and an LED light it was the
 

00:34:44.290 --> 00:34:45.750
solar cell and an LED light it was the
most amazing thing because the first

00:34:45.750 --> 00:34:45.760
most amazing thing because the first
 

00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:47.970
most amazing thing because the first
time the battery else that's where

00:34:47.970 --> 00:34:47.980
time the battery else that's where
 

00:34:47.980 --> 00:34:52.470

I mean it's really you know you're in a

00:34:54.720 --> 00:34:54.730
I mean it's really you know you're in a
 

00:34:54.730 --> 00:34:58.020
I mean it's really you know you're in a
really you know remote part of the world

00:34:58.020 --> 00:34:58.030
really you know remote part of the world
 

00:34:58.030 --> 00:35:03.360
really you know remote part of the world
kind of up kind of in the sky and that's

00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:03.370
kind of up kind of in the sky and that's
 

00:35:03.370 --> 00:35:04.980
kind of up kind of in the sky and that's
