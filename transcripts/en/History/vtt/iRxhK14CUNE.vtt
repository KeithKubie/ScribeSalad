00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:08.920
WAYNE: Oh, there's
something big.

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:11.000
SHELBY: There's
something right there.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
What the hell's going on here?

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:21.620
Oh, [inaudible] [bleep], boy.

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:23.040
That don't sound like wood.

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.500
SHELBY: Oh, it's a big
son of a bitch, ain't it?

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.420
Something's down
there and it's big.

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.000
Let's go get with that
trackhoe and see what's here.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.250
There ain't no way
I can pull us out.

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:32.380
The boat ain't
going to pull out.

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:33.830
I need a damn trackhoe
to pull this out.

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:36.120
NARRATOR: With something
big lurking down below--

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.540
Here we go, man.

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:38.830
All right.

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:42.710
NARRATOR: --there's only one
tool to get for this job--

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:45.000
I need power for
this one, junior.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.040
Here we go.
Ah-ho!

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.380
NARRATOR: --his
trusty Leviathan.

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:51.500
Going to get him now.

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:59.960
Man, we on something big.

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.330
I hope I can dig it
out with the trackhoe.

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:04.750
Get this for Mr. Wayne.

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:07.620
It might something
valuable to him.

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:10.080
WAYNE: This is very exciting.

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.500
I've never seen or been involved
with nothing like this before.

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:14.080
This is unreal.

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:21.790
SHELBY: I really want to
find it for Mr. Wayne,

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:23.920
but I'm having a
hard time finding it.

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:41.580
There's something there, man.

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:49.960
Can't pick it up, too big.

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:51.540
Won't go around it.

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:09.460
Here we go.

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:10.290
Here we go.

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.330
Got it.

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:16.790
SHELBY: There he is.

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:18.210
WAYNE: All right.

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.790
SHELBY: Boy, that's
a good one, Po-Po.

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.670
I got to go take
a look at this.

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.500
SHELBY: That's a
big one, ain't it?

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.500
Man, them stones really did
uncover some big treasures.

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:33.880
You got it.

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.080
[inaudible] Look how big that
[inaudible] is on that thing.

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.170
NARRATOR: Shelby went
hunting for treasure.

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:41.250
WAYNE: All I know is it
come off of a big, big ship.

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.210
NARRATOR: And it looks
like his ship just came in.

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:45.380
There's treasure
out there, man.

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:46.290
It's everywhere.

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.210
[inaudible], junior.

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:51.290
WAYNE: This the best dredge
you and I have ever done.

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:53.120
Let's go put it
on [inaudible]..

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.500
WAYNE: It's going to be an
attraction, I'm telling you.

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.170
NARRATOR: A few
weeks ago, the swamp

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.880
was tore up and spit
out by a wicked round

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.330
of storms and floods.

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:14.120
What's going on, man?

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:15.420
I see you guys [inaudible].

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:16.920
You're going to love
this, I'm telling you.

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.380
This one's good [inaudible].

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:19.880
Oh, man.
Yeah.

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:23.210
NARRATOR: And with his bayou
brothers and sisters hurting,

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:26.710
the swamp superheroes
swooped in to save the day.

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:27.540
WAYNE: Is that fine?

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.290
That is good, man.

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:33.170
NARRATOR: Now, thanks to
Shelby, the treasure hunt museum

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:34.880
is back, bigger than ever.

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:36.290
SHELBY: I seen the
anchor on display.

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:37.580
What a rush.

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:39.000
Glad I could help him out.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.040
NARRATOR: Along with the find
that'll keep business humming.

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.330
It's not only a
big deal for me,

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:46.790
it's a big deal
for the community.

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:50.460
It's all about celebrating
our heritage and our history.

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:52.420
It looks a lot different from
when we dug it up with that--

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:53.380
Yeah, it did.

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:54.880
It's a whole lot
bigger, ain't it?

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:59.120
WAYNE: And look, 3 T.
It weighs three tons.

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.040
SHELBY: I know it was big, man.

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:02.750
WAYNE: 6,000 pounds.

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:04.080
Boy, that is good.

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:06.750
We chained it down so
no one would steal it.

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:09.210
Right, put it in their pocket.

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:11.830
WAYNE: After doing some
research on the anchor,

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:15.920
I think it is from 1901 to 1910.

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:17.920
If it wasn't for
you, we wouldn't

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:20.790
have this here for the
general public to look at.

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:22.880
SHELBY: Yeah, Mr. Wayne's
museum is back up and running.

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:24.330
That's important to me.

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.500
It's important to everyone that
lives down here in the swamp.

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:29.500
You get to see that stuff.
