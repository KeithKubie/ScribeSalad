00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:03.570
&gt;&gt; So if you scroll down to the Related List, you'll see that little

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:04.880
Wrench there, and that allows you to

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:06.990
customize what columns show up in that table.

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.510
&gt;&gt; Okay, so we're on the Stage Record. So what would you

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:12.490
want, if you're looking at a stage, you'd probably want to know.

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:13.790
&gt;&gt; What band is playing.

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:15.210
&gt;&gt; What band,

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:16.090
&gt;&gt; What time they're playing.

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:16.390
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:17.980
&gt;&gt; What day they're playing.

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:18.500
&gt;&gt; The status.

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.970
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So basically all those fields.

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.300
&gt;&gt; So Band, Band Name.

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.530
&gt;&gt; And you definitely want to leave the Set Time Name

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:27.418
there, even though it's not too useful for

00:00:27.418 --> 00:00:29.080
us, because that's going to be what allows

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:32.870
you to click into the Set Time Record itself. It will link you to that record.

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:42.638
&gt;&gt; Okay, cool, Save. I knew this time. That is much better. Code

00:00:42.638 --> 00:00:46.170
Against the Machine and of course we haven't actually specified a day or time.

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.600
&gt;&gt; Right, so, let's go.

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:49.290
&gt;&gt; Let's do some cleanup.

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:50.780
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Let's go fix the

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:52.910
Set Time Record, add those fields to the

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:55.340
Page Layout, and we're going to have the same problem

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:58.240
with not having a related list on Bands. So,

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:00.920
let's also do this on the Band Record also.

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:01.840
&gt;&gt; Okay, sounds good.
