00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:06.000
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:21.740
&gt;&gt; John Cole: Well,
good afternoon.

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:24.810
Welcome, welcome to the
Library of Congress.

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.090
I've just poured two
glasses of water,

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.140
one is for our speaker
and one is for me.

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:33.570
I'm John Cole, the Director
of the Center for the Book.

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.280
And I'm having a hoarse
voice problem this week.

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.780
But I know that I have
enough left in me to get

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.780
through this introduction,
which gives me a great deal

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.990
of pleasure to present a special
book that has a connection

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:50.060
with a previous book
that has appeared

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:53.070
in a Center for the Book series.

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.490
Let me tell you just for
a minute a little bit

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:57.860
about the Center for the Book.

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:02.420
We were created in 1977
by Daniel Boorstin,

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:04.750
when he was Librarian
of Congress.

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:06.830
And his idea was the Library

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:11.350
of Congress needed a
public outreach organization

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:15.960
to promote books and reading
really for the general public

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.600
and to get out and publicize the
importance of books and reading

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.810
and literacy and libraries.

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:26.690
And while it includes scholarly
books -- such as today's,

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:29.910
which is published by the
University of Georgia Press --

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:33.910
actually the emphasis in
many ways was on outreach

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:36.000
and even on new media.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.500
And our very first project,
starting in 1979, was with,

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.510
believe it or not,
CBS Television,

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:45.960
and it was called,
Read More About it.

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.130
And when CBS had a program,
the star of the program --

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.410
some of you may remember those,
they lasted for about a decade.

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:57.250
The star of the program came
out and said, if you've enjoyed

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:01.540
that program, the Library
of Congress suggests you go

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:04.220
to your local library
and bookstore.

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:07.140
For heaven's sake, don't go
to the Library of Congress.

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.500
I said that, that wasn't
part of the message.

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.150
Go to your local library or
bookstore, they'll be happy

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.360
to help you read more about it.

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.140
But the fun part
of that for us was,

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.230
it helped us develop
partnerships with book sellers

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.260
and with libraries
and with others.

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:32.560
And that got us started
in what will be in 2017,

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:38.100
the 40th anniversary of our book
and reading promotion project.

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:42.650
One of our major projects is
the National Book Festival.

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:45.240
How many of you have been to
the National Book Festival?

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.120
Several of you, I hope.

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.990
It's a wonderful
Library of Congress event

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:54.250
in which the Center for
the Book plays a key role.

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:58.430
And we're very proud of the
strategic role that we play.

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:02.090
We also reach out to the
states kind of in the spirit

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:07.170
of Dr. Boorstin through creating
affiliated Centers for the Book

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:11.460
that promote books and reading
and often state authors.

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:13.390
And so for example, you know,

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:16.120
there is a Texas
Center for the Book.

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.000
There's one for each state.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.960
And we work with them on several
different kinds of projects.

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:26.880
But one of them turns out to
be the National Book Festival,

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:31.800
because there is a pavilion of
the states that people from all

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:35.380
over the country come
to show their wares.

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:39.380
This year's festival was at the
Washington Convention Center

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:41.850
and was enormously successful.

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:44.080
And we're eagerly making plans

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:47.850
for what will be the 16th
National Book Festival.

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:52.800
I hope that you will watch the
newspaper and stay in touch

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:55.690
with us to learn when
it's going to occur.

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:58.630
Another important activity
here at the Library

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:01.840
of Congress is this
kind of talk .

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.640
We call this Books and Beyond.

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:09.150
And the idea is to honor
authors and new books

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:14.230
that have been published just
recently that relate to if not

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:16.800
to the collections of
the Library of Congress,

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:20.420
at least to other libraries
and research institutions.

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:24.090
So we could always make the
point that all the research

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:28.380
and hard work and editing
that go behind books,

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:33.200
often they indeed do still get
published and do still get sold

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:37.800
and are still really major
ways of sharing information.

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:43.800
So these noontime talks are
also filmed for the Library

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:45.540
of Congress's website.

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:48.720
So before we start,
I'd like to invite you

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:51.310
to turn off all things
electronic

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:54.580
and to say just a
word about our format.

00:04:54.580 --> 00:05:01.710
That will be a presentation by
our author Carol McCabe Booker,

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:05.920
but also then a chance for
a question-and-answer period

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:08.620
and a book signing to follow.

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:12.170
And there are books for sale,
and I hope you'll take advantage

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:16.660
of that and talking to Carol
a bit about of the book

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:20.350
and about the remarkable
person who she's writing about.

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:29.070
Alice Dunnigan is going to be
the topic of our talk today.

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:34.570
Our author -- our editor
author, Carol McCabe Booker,

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:40.990
has condensed Dunnigan's 1974
self-published autobiography

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:44.750
to appeal to a broader
audience and annotated it.

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:48.330
And Carol is going to be able
to tell you all about that.

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:50.620
What I've learned a
little bit from our own --

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:52.320
from looking at the book

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:54.770
and from our own press
release is something else

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:59.710
that will be a major topic, and
that is Alice Dunnigan herself,

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:03.280
who turns out to be
quite a remarkable person

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:07.150
and is a pioneer in the
Black Press Movement

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:09.070
through her achievements.

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:13.430
And I must say that -- and I
will again defer to our author

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:15.530
to give you more details.

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:19.680
Carol herself is
a special person.

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:23.870
Carol McCabe Booker is a
former journalist in Washington

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:27.430
and also especially a
Washington attorney.

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:29.720
But the Center for the
Book had the good fortune

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:35.390
of sponsoring just about
two years ago this month,

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:39.510
a book with her husband,
journalist Simeon Booker.

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:42.840
There was a program we had
over in the Whittall Pavilion,

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:45.510
another one of the
library's buildings.

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:49.450
And it was called, Shocking the
Conscience, a Reporter's Account

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:51.350
of the Civil Rights Movement.

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:54.040
So you can see that
today's presentation

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:59.930
and the previous presentation
are both celebrating the civil

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:02.240
rights anniversaries
that are very much part

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:04.610
of what the Library is doing.

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:08.030
And Simeon is here and I
would like him to raise a hand

00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:11.510
and let's give him a round of
applause, who is the author.

00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:15.050
[ Applause ]

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:18.940
The co-author at that time of
what was a and what remains

00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:21.940
to be a remarkable book.

00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:25.090
At this time though I would
like to introduce Carol,

00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:30.280
who not only will tell you how
she managed to put this together

00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:33.240
but I think give you
a new appreciation

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:35.580
of this important pioneer

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:38.880
of National Black
Press, Alice Dunnigan.

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:41.510
Let's welcome Carol.

00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:45.290
[ Applause ]

00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:51.090
&gt;&gt; And I'll take my
glass of water if I may.

00:07:55.290 --> 00:07:56.900
&gt;&gt; Carol McCabe Booker:
Thank you, Dr. Cole.

00:07:56.900 --> 00:07:59.280
And thank you all for coming.

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:03.060
It gives me great pleasure
to talk about this book here

00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:04.670
in the Library of Congress.

00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:08.050
Because the rebirth
of the autobiography

00:08:08.050 --> 00:08:10.840
of Alice Dunnigan
took place largely

00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:13.720
because of the help I
received from the staff

00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:15.630
of the Library of Congress.

00:08:15.630 --> 00:08:18.660
First of all, I fell in love
with Alice Dunnigan right

00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:21.530
across the street in
the Jefferson Building,

00:08:21.530 --> 00:08:26.330
under that magnificent dome
over the main reading room.

00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:29.980
And then, I decided right then
and there, more people have

00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:32.960
to be able to read this book.

00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:35.320
But to do it, it
needed annotation,

00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:37.000
it needed some updating --

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:38.790
although she had a
lot of good footnotes

00:08:38.790 --> 00:08:40.590
in it -- it needed some more.

00:08:40.590 --> 00:08:43.970
And that's where I got a
lot of help from the staff

00:08:43.970 --> 00:08:49.450
of the Library, particularly
the newspaper and periodicals,

00:08:49.450 --> 00:08:53.060
reading room, where I
found access to many

00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:57.110
of the old newspapers, the Black
Press papers, that are available

00:08:57.110 --> 00:08:59.880
on the ProQuest and
other databases.

00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:02.420
So you can see what
she wrote about.

00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:07.130
Because Alice Dunnigan, while
you may not have heard of her,

00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:11.640
she did more than any
other journalist of her era

00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:15.880
to keep black Americans
informed about what was going

00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:19.030
on in the struggle
for civil rights.

00:09:19.030 --> 00:09:21.990
And I can say that
without any fear

00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:26.050
of anybody contradicting it,
because of the numbers alone.

00:09:26.050 --> 00:09:30.080
She wrote headline front
page stories for more

00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:34.600
than 100 black newspapers
across the country.

00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:37.840
And they included
the most influential,

00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:42.370
the Chicago Defender,
the Pittsburgh Courier,

00:09:42.370 --> 00:09:44.730
the Norfolk Journal and Guide,

00:09:44.730 --> 00:09:47.570
as well as the New York
Amsterdam News, the Baltimore

00:09:47.570 --> 00:09:51.390
and Washington Afro, the
Kansas City Plaindealer,

00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:56.140
the Oklahoma Dispatch, the Los
Angeles Sentinel, on and on.

00:09:56.140 --> 00:09:59.590
People learned what was
going on in the Congress,

00:09:59.590 --> 00:10:03.190
in the White House, in
Washington, in politics,

00:10:03.190 --> 00:10:06.530
and also, out of Washington.

00:10:06.530 --> 00:10:10.390
Because she wasn't going
to be kept just here.

00:10:10.390 --> 00:10:12.350
Alice wanted to go
where the news was,

00:10:12.350 --> 00:10:14.920
and she wanted to report it.

00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:18.990
Why don't we know about her?

00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:21.380
Well, look at the times.

00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:24.190
First of all, we think of the
Civil Rights Movement starting

00:10:24.190 --> 00:10:25.950
with the Montgomery bus boycott.

00:10:25.950 --> 00:10:27.900
That's not really true.

00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:31.350
There were a lot of things
going on in the '40s and '50s.

00:10:31.350 --> 00:10:32.850
And one of Alice's purposes

00:10:32.850 --> 00:10:35.980
in writing her book was
to let you know that.

00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:39.320
The other thing she makes
very clear in her introduction

00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:42.510
to the book is she wants
it to be remembered,

00:10:42.510 --> 00:10:47.090
the role of the Black Press
and black writers generally

00:10:47.090 --> 00:10:51.150
in making known what she called
"the shenanigans" of whites

00:10:51.150 --> 00:10:54.710
in trying to keep down
the black population.

00:10:54.710 --> 00:10:58.490
Without black writers and black
journalists, the Black Press,

00:10:58.490 --> 00:11:01.470
she said, a lot of that
would've been lost.

00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:05.400
The other thing she wanted to
do in writing this book was

00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:10.070
to inspire young women
never to give up.

00:11:10.070 --> 00:11:15.040
And in that regard, looking
back on this magnificent career,

00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:19.810
she asks one favor from
us, one little request.

00:11:19.810 --> 00:11:24.740
She said, please do not
judge me by the heights

00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:29.220
to which I have risen but by
the depths from which I came.

00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:32.180
That's paraphrasing
Frederick Douglass,

00:11:32.180 --> 00:11:34.310
but it's it's Alice Dunnigan.

00:11:34.310 --> 00:11:37.860
And that's why I want to
look back to where she began

00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:42.010
in Depression -- pre-Depression
era and then coming

00:11:42.010 --> 00:11:45.370
through Depression,
in a border state.

00:11:45.370 --> 00:11:47.610
Now, a border state, Kentucky,

00:11:47.610 --> 00:11:49.720
was different from
the deep South.

00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:52.970
And that became apparent
as she told her story.

00:11:52.970 --> 00:11:55.330
Before I get on to all of that,

00:11:55.330 --> 00:11:58.060
let me tell you how I
got involved in this.

00:11:58.060 --> 00:12:02.620
Dr. Cole very kindly mentioned
my husband, Simeon Booker.

00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:05.410
Admittedly, an icon
of the Black Press

00:12:05.410 --> 00:12:07.580
and the Civil Rights Movement.

00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:11.110
He was inducted into
the National Association

00:12:11.110 --> 00:12:14.370
of Black Journalists Hall
of Fame the same night

00:12:14.370 --> 00:12:17.930
as Alice Dunnigan, she
was inducted posthumously.

00:12:17.930 --> 00:12:19.960
He was 94x.

00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:24.420
It was a great evening,
January 2013.

00:12:24.420 --> 00:12:25.850
And they mentioned
at the time --

00:12:25.850 --> 00:12:29.060
Paul Brock, one of the
founders of the NABJ --

00:12:29.060 --> 00:12:33.310
mentioned that both of
them had written books

00:12:33.310 --> 00:12:34.930
about the events they covered.

00:12:34.930 --> 00:12:37.060
Simeon's had just came out.

00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:40.470
So it was a great time
for this induction.

00:12:40.470 --> 00:12:42.860
And Paul Brock mentioned that,

00:12:42.860 --> 00:12:46.730
through this new electronic
miracle and computers and all,

00:12:46.730 --> 00:12:49.470
people right there in the
audience could order a copy

00:12:49.470 --> 00:12:53.420
of his book by taking their
smartphone and wiping it --

00:12:53.420 --> 00:12:59.320
swiping it across a cue,
something code in an ad

00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:03.300
that the University Press of
Mississippi took in the program.

00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:05.900
And then he said,
oh, but, please,

00:13:05.900 --> 00:13:07.200
wait and do it afterwards.

00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:09.570
As I'm thinking, wait a
minute, let them do it now!

00:13:09.570 --> 00:13:13.700
This is 50 years of this man's
life went into this book!

00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:15.000
Why are we waiting?

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:16.300
We went on with the program

00:13:16.300 --> 00:13:18.350
and they mentioned Alice
had also written a book.

00:13:18.350 --> 00:13:20.010
And I remember this.

00:13:20.010 --> 00:13:24.450
I had met Alice Dunnigan
at a jet Christmas party

00:13:24.450 --> 00:13:27.730
and at other social functions,
but I never really knew her.

00:13:27.730 --> 00:13:30.320
I came to Washington in '66.

00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:34.450
By then, she had moved onto
her third career, in politics,

00:13:34.450 --> 00:13:36.510
working in the White House.

00:13:36.510 --> 00:13:40.510
So I didn't really know much
about her journalism career.

00:13:40.510 --> 00:13:43.360
So when they mentioned
that she had self-published

00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:47.500
in 1974 a memoir, an
autobiography, called,

00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:52.680
A Black Woman's Experience from
Schoolhouse to the White House,

00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:54.960
the Autobiography
of Alice Dunnigan.

00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:57.060
I said, cool, I want
to read this.

00:13:57.060 --> 00:13:58.900
It's about time.

00:13:58.900 --> 00:14:01.100
Well, I got a little surprise.

00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:03.580
When I went looking
for it online --

00:14:03.580 --> 00:14:07.160
as most of us do when we go
looking for a book we want

00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:08.870
to read at home, kicking back,

00:14:08.870 --> 00:14:12.790
and taking our time
-- I couldn't find it.

00:14:12.790 --> 00:14:17.960
A little more searching, I found
it available from a few old,

00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:23.900
rare booksellers for over $100.

00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:25.970
Now, I wanted to read
it but I didn't want

00:14:25.970 --> 00:14:27.440
to read it that badly.

00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:29.350
So then I started
looking at libraries.

00:14:29.350 --> 00:14:33.790
You couldn't find it except
in the reference sections.

00:14:33.790 --> 00:14:37.490
And luckily, the Library of
Congress had it, of course,

00:14:37.490 --> 00:14:40.290
and I live just a
few blocks from here.

00:14:40.290 --> 00:14:45.060
So I ordered it from off-site,
came over, started reading it.

00:14:45.060 --> 00:14:49.070
And as I said, I fell in
love with Alice Dunnigan.

00:14:49.070 --> 00:14:54.400
Although, I must say, you got to
know maybe more than you wanted

00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:59.020
to know, because the
book was over 670 pages.

00:14:59.020 --> 00:15:03.550
And it took several
visits to read it.

00:15:03.550 --> 00:15:08.500
And when I finished, I realized
that of the three sections --

00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:11.690
Growing up in Kentucky,
Coming to Washington,

00:15:11.690 --> 00:15:17.720
and then Leaving Journalism in
1960 to work in the White House

00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:22.170
as an education consultant
with, oh, first it was the EEOC

00:15:22.170 --> 00:15:25.940
and then it was the President's
Council on Youth Opportunity --

00:15:25.940 --> 00:15:29.750
that part was less compelling
than the earlier part.

00:15:29.750 --> 00:15:32.930
And I wanted people
to read this book.

00:15:32.930 --> 00:15:36.750
So as one reviewer
said loving later on,

00:15:36.750 --> 00:15:39.160
I took a machete to
it, I'll admit it.

00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:41.700
I lobbed off the last
third of the book.

00:15:41.700 --> 00:15:45.900
But anyone who wants to do
that research into that era,

00:15:45.900 --> 00:15:49.530
it's there, they can go,
they can look for it.

00:15:49.530 --> 00:15:52.760
It's in the reference section.

00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:57.460
But the rest of it, the two
earlier parts, are so compelling

00:15:57.460 --> 00:16:00.660
that it should be
available to anybody.

00:16:00.660 --> 00:16:05.310
And I sent out a proposal to
three academic publishers,

00:16:05.310 --> 00:16:09.710
all three wrote back immediately
and said they wanted this book.

00:16:09.710 --> 00:16:12.400
One of them, thought, the
University of Georgia,

00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:16.130
recognized that this
book should be priced

00:16:16.130 --> 00:16:19.760
so that people can buy
it, not just libraries.

00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:23.670
One library -- one publisher
wanted to charge $45.

00:16:23.670 --> 00:16:24.970
I said, no.

00:16:24.970 --> 00:16:28.990
So it's available now
at a reasonable price.

00:16:28.990 --> 00:16:31.800
Some day hopefully
it will also come

00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:34.320
out as a young readers edition.

00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:37.450
Because Alice really wanted
to reach the young readers.

00:16:37.450 --> 00:16:41.970
And anybody who has read it
knows, it has great appeal

00:16:41.970 --> 00:16:46.670
to the I would say 9
to 16-year-old group.

00:16:46.670 --> 00:16:49.650
And I'm hoping that
that happens.

00:16:49.650 --> 00:16:55.290
But let me talk about what she's
talking about when Alice says,

00:16:55.290 --> 00:16:56.880
judge me if we're
going to judge me,

00:16:56.880 --> 00:16:58.840
and we do whether
we want to or not.

00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:02.620
Judge me by the depths
from which I came.

00:17:02.620 --> 00:17:07.000
Alice was born in
1906 in a rural part

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:11.550
of Kentucky, Logan County.

00:17:11.550 --> 00:17:14.650
And she wanted to go to
school so desperately

00:17:14.650 --> 00:17:16.840
from the time she
was four years old.

00:17:16.840 --> 00:17:19.370
And it isn't that
Alice was thinking, oh,

00:17:19.370 --> 00:17:21.700
my great intellect,
I must go to school.

00:17:21.700 --> 00:17:23.230
Alice was lonely.

00:17:23.230 --> 00:17:28.380
She lived on a hill about 4
miles outside of Russellville,

00:17:28.380 --> 00:17:30.700
which was a small
town of only 5000.

00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:32.610
There were no other
kids her age.

00:17:32.610 --> 00:17:36.620
So she starts off wanting
to walk the 4 miles

00:17:36.620 --> 00:17:40.010
to Russellville to
Sunday school.

00:17:40.010 --> 00:17:46.020
But then as she goes to
school, she becomes an admirer

00:17:46.020 --> 00:17:49.520
of the Sunday school
teacher, Miss Auletta Vaughn.

00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:53.820
Miss Auletta Vaughn is respected
and she's lovely and she gets

00:17:53.820 --> 00:17:56.810
in front of audiences
and she talks to people.

00:17:56.810 --> 00:17:59.000
And little Alice says,
I want to be just

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.790
like Miss Auletta
when I grow up.

00:18:01.790 --> 00:18:07.020
So she goes to school
every day, snow, whatever.

00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:08.540
Her father thinks she's crazy.

00:18:08.540 --> 00:18:09.840
Her mother bundles her up.

00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:11.600
She walks off by herself.

00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:14.270
The only other kid around
is an 11-year-old brother

00:18:14.270 --> 00:18:16.370
who doesn't want anything
to do with this little girl.

00:18:16.370 --> 00:18:17.670
He's half brother.

00:18:17.670 --> 00:18:21.210
And he finds her embarrassing.

00:18:21.210 --> 00:18:24.550
But pretty soon she
comes to the realization

00:18:24.550 --> 00:18:29.370
that there are three careers
available to a black woman

00:18:29.370 --> 00:18:31.690
in Kentucky at this time.

00:18:31.690 --> 00:18:34.060
One of them is to
pursue an education

00:18:34.060 --> 00:18:36.410
and become a schoolteacher.

00:18:36.410 --> 00:18:39.560
The other two are to
work as a domestic

00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:41.400
or to work in the fields.

00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:43.200
Her father is a sharecropper.

00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:45.220
Her mother takes in laundry.

00:18:45.220 --> 00:18:49.720
She just does not want
that life for herself.

00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:52.680
And so she pursues
the schooling.

00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:56.200
To the degree where she becomes
the valedictorian of the class.

00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:57.760
She graduates.

00:18:57.760 --> 00:19:02.560
It's a fascinating story
of how she pursues getting

00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:04.200
onto teacher education.

00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:05.660
But let me jump ahead.

00:19:05.660 --> 00:19:09.320
Somebody said in writing
about her recently,

00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:11.870
he implied that she was timid.

00:19:11.870 --> 00:19:14.370
Well, let me just touch on
some of the things in her life

00:19:14.370 --> 00:19:17.130
that show us that right
from a little kid,

00:19:17.130 --> 00:19:19.330
Alice was never ever timid.

00:19:19.330 --> 00:19:21.910
And if there's one thing
we should take away

00:19:21.910 --> 00:19:23.460
and tell young girls today is,

00:19:23.460 --> 00:19:26.000
you don't get anywhere
by being timid.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:30.570
But Alice goes to her first
job, which is 30 miles away

00:19:30.570 --> 00:19:32.620
from home, in Mount Pisgah.

00:19:32.620 --> 00:19:36.160
Mount Pisgah consists
of all of five houses,

00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:38.530
a church, and a rundown school.

00:19:38.530 --> 00:19:44.690
The nearest town is about 8
miles away, Trenton, Kentucky.

00:19:44.690 --> 00:19:46.790
Big population, 800.

00:19:46.790 --> 00:19:48.110
She is way out in the boonies.

00:19:48.110 --> 00:19:51.680
She takes one look at the school
and she doesn't say anything

00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:56.050
because she's so pleased, so
proud to have her first job.

00:19:56.050 --> 00:19:57.930
She's 18 years old.

00:19:57.930 --> 00:20:01.410
But she walks, in
the roof is leaking.

00:20:01.410 --> 00:20:03.570
The windows, two
windows on each side

00:20:03.570 --> 00:20:07.230
that should be there are covered
with yellowing cardboard.

00:20:07.230 --> 00:20:11.150
The floor is roughhewn
wood, bare,

00:20:11.150 --> 00:20:14.510
and when you walk
on it, dust rises.

00:20:14.510 --> 00:20:17.540
There are no desks.

00:20:17.540 --> 00:20:20.970
There are old church
pews that been discarded.

00:20:20.970 --> 00:20:24.090
And cold. The teacher being the
first one to arrive at seven

00:20:24.090 --> 00:20:26.080
in the morning has to go
out and shovel the coal

00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:28.050
which is just dumped
in the yard,

00:20:28.050 --> 00:20:31.600
into this potbelly
stove that's rigged up.

00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:35.620
And rain or shine, the room
has to be kept warm that way.

00:20:35.620 --> 00:20:38.710
And then she gets
the real bad news.

00:20:38.710 --> 00:20:42.580
Well, second bad, second bad.

00:20:42.580 --> 00:20:44.860
45 students on average.

00:20:44.860 --> 00:20:46.710
65 are enrolled.

00:20:46.710 --> 00:20:50.660
45 on average come
to the school.

00:20:50.660 --> 00:20:52.160
And that's pretty good.

00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:55.920
Because in a rural area, folks
have to keep the kids home

00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:57.940
to work in the fields
and this bad weather

00:20:57.940 --> 00:21:00.300
and the long distance to travel.

00:21:00.300 --> 00:21:03.620
45 kids grades one
through eight in one room.

00:21:03.620 --> 00:21:07.020
I kind of had to
stop right there.

00:21:07.020 --> 00:21:09.980
I'm thinking, oh my
God, I couldn't do this.

00:21:09.980 --> 00:21:12.380
This doesn't phase Alice.

00:21:12.380 --> 00:21:17.700
One fact does, nobody
in the recollection

00:21:17.700 --> 00:21:20.470
of all the townspeople,
of all the people,

00:21:20.470 --> 00:21:22.960
the parents of those
schoolchildren --

00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:27.750
nobody recalls anyone ever
graduating from this school

00:21:27.750 --> 00:21:29.390
from the eighth grade.

00:21:29.390 --> 00:21:32.000
Now, what you had to do to
graduate in this county,

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:35.400
Todd County, was to pass a
test, same test for the black

00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:37.350
and the white students.

00:21:37.350 --> 00:21:40.730
And Alice knows right off
the bat, these black kids are

00:21:40.730 --> 00:21:43.060
as smart as their
white counterparts.

00:21:43.060 --> 00:21:44.910
So it's not that.

00:21:44.910 --> 00:21:46.650
She figures either they drop

00:21:46.650 --> 00:21:50.390
out because boys especially
are encouraged to drop

00:21:50.390 --> 00:21:51.840
out by the sixth grade.

00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:54.100
It's not manly to
stay in school.

00:21:54.100 --> 00:21:57.500
You've got to get out and flex
your muscles and work behind

00:21:57.500 --> 00:21:59.530
that mule and show
that you're a man.

00:21:59.530 --> 00:22:01.910
So even her brother, he quits

00:22:01.910 --> 00:22:04.040
by the time he's
in the sixth grade.

00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:06.670
So she said, maybe they don't
bother to take the test,

00:22:06.670 --> 00:22:08.920
they don't graduate
from the eighth grade.

00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:11.000
Or maybe they're intimidated

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:13.790
because they think maybe
the grading is going

00:22:13.790 --> 00:22:16.230
to be weighed against them.

00:22:16.230 --> 00:22:18.980
Or maybe they're
just not prepared.

00:22:18.980 --> 00:22:21.970
And she says, I am going
to prepare these students.

00:22:21.970 --> 00:22:24.800
She's got three who
are ready to graduate,

00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:27.560
three girls, 16, 17, and 18.

00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:30.370
She makes that her top goal.

00:22:30.370 --> 00:22:33.240
And to jump ahead
again, she succeeds.

00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:37.010
In the meantime though, here's
her first month on the job.

00:22:37.010 --> 00:22:42.240
At the end of the month, she
goes down to the county seat.

00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:44.610
She gets her check, $65.

00:22:44.610 --> 00:22:48.440
More money than she's ever
seen in her entire life.

00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:52.940
And she decides to see the
white school superintendent.

00:22:52.940 --> 00:22:58.030
And she goes in with a
long list of improvements

00:22:58.030 --> 00:22:59.500
that she wants made
in the school.

00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:01.190
He is not happy.

00:23:01.190 --> 00:23:02.910
And she is not timid.

00:23:02.910 --> 00:23:07.140
Alice presents this list,
but she is so gracious.

00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:10.370
Her son describes
her as persistent.

00:23:10.370 --> 00:23:13.300
If she asks you for something
on Monday and you don't give it

00:23:13.300 --> 00:23:16.880
to her, she'll be back
on Tuesday and Wednesday

00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:19.200
and Thursday, till she gets it.

00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:23.830
But she is the loveliest,
politest, determined woman.

00:23:23.830 --> 00:23:26.320
So she's going to
reason with this man,

00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:29.830
as she will people
throughout her career, reason.

00:23:29.830 --> 00:23:32.920
Well, he quickly sees that
a floor with dust rising

00:23:32.920 --> 00:23:35.250
from it is not healthy and
they're going to have a lot

00:23:35.250 --> 00:23:36.900
of health problems
with these kids.

00:23:36.900 --> 00:23:40.130
So he gives her some oil
to throw on the floor

00:23:40.130 --> 00:23:42.530
to tamp down the dust.

00:23:42.530 --> 00:23:45.050
He realizes a leaky
roof is a bad idea.

00:23:45.050 --> 00:23:50.680
And he realizes that windows
that don't keep out the cold

00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:54.060
and that don't let in the
light, not a good idea.

00:23:54.060 --> 00:23:55.500
So they're going
to get new windows.

00:23:55.500 --> 00:23:58.420
And then he says, you know,
I have a warehouse full

00:23:58.420 --> 00:24:02.470
of old desks that have been
thrown out of white schools.

00:24:02.470 --> 00:24:05.920
He says, if you can bring
somebody up here, they're yours.

00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:07.610
And so she does.

00:24:07.610 --> 00:24:13.580
So Alice pursues her teaching
career along these lines.

00:24:13.580 --> 00:24:15.590
There are times when
she gets a job in one

00:24:15.590 --> 00:24:17.150
of the Rosenwald schools.

00:24:17.150 --> 00:24:20.450
Which, you know, were
a great improvement.

00:24:20.450 --> 00:24:25.320
Came about through a friendship
between Julius Rosenwald

00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:30.760
of Chicago, philanthropist,
and Booker T. Washington.

00:24:30.760 --> 00:24:32.480
So they're a step up.

00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:35.410
But mostly, she's in there,
she's fighting all the way.

00:24:35.410 --> 00:24:38.590
But this is not what gets Alice.

00:24:38.590 --> 00:24:41.150
Alice is an activist
from day one.

00:24:41.150 --> 00:24:42.720
This is another reason
why we know,

00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:45.320
there's no timidity
in this woman.

00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:47.210
When she was a little kid,
her mother would take her

00:24:47.210 --> 00:24:49.410
down to Russellville
on Saturday,

00:24:49.410 --> 00:24:51.260
where everybody went
on Saturdays.

00:24:51.260 --> 00:24:53.710
You went to buy anything
that you needed.

00:24:53.710 --> 00:24:55.010
You went to meet friends,

00:24:55.010 --> 00:24:57.910
chat on the corner,
hang out for a while.

00:24:57.910 --> 00:25:00.780
Well, it only one
bathroom for women.

00:25:00.780 --> 00:25:02.720
And it was in the courthouse.

00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:05.450
And it had a sign on
it, "white ladies."

00:25:05.450 --> 00:25:07.830
Alice had walked right in there

00:25:07.830 --> 00:25:10.460
when she needed to
use the bathroom.

00:25:10.460 --> 00:25:12.550
To the point where her
mother said to her, Alice,

00:25:12.550 --> 00:25:15.010
one of these days one of
them white women is going

00:25:15.010 --> 00:25:17.200
to beat you half to death and
they ain't nothing I'm going

00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:18.500
to be able to do about it.

00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:21.060
Well, Alice didn't
care, she kept right on.

00:25:21.060 --> 00:25:23.320
That sign stayed there till well

00:25:23.320 --> 00:25:25.270
after the Civil Rights
Act was passed,

00:25:25.270 --> 00:25:27.170
because if nobody made
them take it down,

00:25:27.170 --> 00:25:28.820
they weren't going
to take it down.

00:25:28.820 --> 00:25:31.350
But a number of things
like this.

00:25:31.350 --> 00:25:32.760
She was not complacent

00:25:32.760 --> 00:25:35.680
and it was the complacency
that got her.

00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:38.570
Finally, when she's
about 38 years of age,

00:25:38.570 --> 00:25:42.430
she tries to organize a civic
league so that women who worked

00:25:42.430 --> 00:25:46.440
as domestics would demand
at least a minimum wage.

00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:49.010
She tried to get
them to say, hey,

00:25:49.010 --> 00:25:52.120
if you're not delivering the
mail to black neighborhoods

00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:55.940
because the roads aren't
paved, well, pave the roads,

00:25:55.940 --> 00:25:57.240
and that kind of thing.

00:25:57.240 --> 00:25:58.720
Well, everybody sat
there and said, yeah,

00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:01.130
oh, yeah, oh, great idea.

00:26:01.130 --> 00:26:04.730
Then they went home and told
their white employers on her.

00:26:04.730 --> 00:26:07.820
She worked for the
school system,

00:26:07.820 --> 00:26:10.320
so her job was immediately
in jeopardy.

00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:15.890
That and an incident right
in the drug store downtown

00:26:15.890 --> 00:26:18.740
where she wanted to buy a
Coke to wash down some aspirin

00:26:18.740 --> 00:26:21.930
because she had a migraine
headache, and the clerk looks

00:26:21.930 --> 00:26:26.310
at her and says, we don't
sell Coke to coloreds.

00:26:26.310 --> 00:26:29.590
She goes outside,
she's sick on the curb.

00:26:29.590 --> 00:26:31.760
She's not anonymous by
then, because she's doing

00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:34.420
such a good job,
people know who she is.

00:26:34.420 --> 00:26:35.900
So a woman walking by says,

00:26:35.900 --> 00:26:38.620
ain't that the teacher
from Adairville?

00:26:38.620 --> 00:26:41.280
And Alice -- she's
so humiliated.

00:26:41.280 --> 00:26:43.740
She's wondering, do
they think I'm drunk?

00:26:43.740 --> 00:26:45.040
Do they think I'm crazy?

00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:46.680
It's just the end.

00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:50.540
She prays like crazy
to get out of Kentucky.

00:26:50.540 --> 00:26:52.330
And then the war comes along.

00:26:52.330 --> 00:26:56.700
And she sees a noticed, like so
many people across the country,

00:26:56.700 --> 00:27:01.610
especially women, a notice
hanging up in the post office.

00:27:01.610 --> 00:27:06.750
The government was recruiting
typists to work in Washington.

00:27:06.750 --> 00:27:09.710
She filled out the form
saying she'd worked anywhere,

00:27:09.710 --> 00:27:12.260
could leave anytime.

00:27:12.260 --> 00:27:15.010
So she had to go in and
take the typing test.

00:27:15.010 --> 00:27:17.980
Well, there were no
typewriters available.

00:27:17.980 --> 00:27:19.930
She hauled her own
that she had gotten,

00:27:19.930 --> 00:27:21.450
a used typewriter somewhere.

00:27:21.450 --> 00:27:24.450
She hauls it in, even
though it's unreliable,

00:27:24.450 --> 00:27:26.270
some of the letters are crooked.

00:27:26.270 --> 00:27:27.580
She takes the test.

00:27:27.580 --> 00:27:28.880
She's nervous.

00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:33.300
But the postmaster says, wow she
did so well on the written part,

00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:38.060
he says, just calm down, take
the typing test over again.

00:27:38.060 --> 00:27:40.220
She does and she passes.

00:27:40.220 --> 00:27:45.730
She gets a telegram on Wednesday
before Thanksgiving saying,

00:27:45.730 --> 00:27:49.820
report to Washington 9 am
at a government agency.

00:27:49.820 --> 00:27:54.500
She's on the train, out of
Russellville that Sunday,

00:27:54.500 --> 00:27:57.960
onto a whole new life.

00:27:57.960 --> 00:27:59.460
That's just a hint.

00:27:59.460 --> 00:28:01.010
A friend of mine who happens

00:28:01.010 --> 00:28:05.450
to be here today was reading
the book a couple of months ago.

00:28:05.450 --> 00:28:11.300
And a few chapters into this,
she called me and she said,

00:28:11.300 --> 00:28:15.000
I'm reading Alice
Dunnigan's book.

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:16.300
And I paused.

00:28:16.300 --> 00:28:21.830
She was waiting for
me to say something.

00:28:21.830 --> 00:28:23.480
I was holding my breath.

00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:26.470
And she said, I love her.

00:28:26.470 --> 00:28:30.170
You read this book, you
will love Alice Dunnigan.

00:28:30.170 --> 00:28:33.560
And she tells these
stories so matter-of-factly,

00:28:33.560 --> 00:28:36.290
particularly during
the Depression.

00:28:36.290 --> 00:28:38.730
She gets one of these
make-work jobs from the WPA,

00:28:38.730 --> 00:28:43.350
only because she goes in
and raises heck over it.

00:28:43.350 --> 00:28:47.610
They're only giving these jobs
to white women, to mend books,

00:28:47.610 --> 00:28:50.920
sew clothes for kids,
nothing for black women.

00:28:50.920 --> 00:28:54.680
So she makes a fuss
and they decide, okay,

00:28:54.680 --> 00:28:56.330
they have black women
doing things

00:28:56.330 --> 00:28:58.340
like cleaning public buildings.

00:28:58.340 --> 00:29:00.600
Weren't many of them
in Russellville.

00:29:00.600 --> 00:29:04.420
When they finish that, okay,
pull up the onion grass

00:29:04.420 --> 00:29:06.590
in the black cemetery,
finish that.

00:29:06.590 --> 00:29:09.310
Okay, go over to
the white cemetery.

00:29:09.310 --> 00:29:11.060
Well, they didn't
have any onion grass

00:29:11.060 --> 00:29:12.580
in the lovely white cemetery.

00:29:12.580 --> 00:29:15.520
So they had them
scrubbing the tombstones.

00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:18.840
Well, while there, they could
see the garbage truck coming

00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:21.010
out of town once a week

00:29:21.010 --> 00:29:25.820
and dropping its load
into the town dump.

00:29:25.820 --> 00:29:28.170
And then the black
women race would

00:29:28.170 --> 00:29:31.230
over there once the truck
was gone, race over there

00:29:31.230 --> 00:29:33.980
and find whatever
produce had been dumped

00:29:33.980 --> 00:29:37.100
that still had some life in
it, that was still edible.

00:29:37.100 --> 00:29:39.520
She described how
you took the cabbage

00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:43.010
and you cut off the rotten part
and you cooked the rest of it.

00:29:43.010 --> 00:29:45.990
If the milk was -- if the meat
was beginning to get moldy,

00:29:45.990 --> 00:29:47.650
well, you just cut
off the bad part,

00:29:47.650 --> 00:29:49.550
soaked it overnight,
and cooked it.

00:29:49.550 --> 00:29:54.480
But there was no, oh, poor
me, oh, feel sorry for me.

00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:56.750
It was more like a,
here's how to get

00:29:56.750 --> 00:30:00.080
by if tough times
ever come your way.

00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:01.510
It was like very matter-of-fact.

00:30:01.510 --> 00:30:04.130
She is a journalist, she
writes like a journalist.

00:30:04.130 --> 00:30:05.660
She doesn't write
like Langston Hughes.

00:30:05.660 --> 00:30:06.960
She's not a poet.

00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:09.940
So when people say she
wasn't a great writer --

00:30:09.940 --> 00:30:11.380
I asked my husband.

00:30:11.380 --> 00:30:13.300
What do you make of that?

00:30:13.300 --> 00:30:14.900
He said, you don't have
to be a great writer

00:30:14.900 --> 00:30:16.420
to be a great reporter.

00:30:16.420 --> 00:30:18.850
You just got to tell
it like it is.

00:30:18.850 --> 00:30:20.240
So she comes on to Washington.

00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:21.540
She works in the government.

00:30:21.540 --> 00:30:22.840
She works her way up.

00:30:22.840 --> 00:30:24.140
She makes a fuss.

00:30:24.140 --> 00:30:27.140
She describes herself as a
flea in the collar sometimes.

00:30:27.140 --> 00:30:32.210
So then the war ends and
these jobs are eliminated.

00:30:32.210 --> 00:30:34.600
Well, at the same time,
she had been freelancing --

00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:38.170
as she did throughout her
career -- as a teacher .

00:30:38.170 --> 00:30:40.320
She would freelance
for the Black Press.

00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:44.180
She was freelancing for
the Associated Negro Press,

00:30:44.180 --> 00:30:49.510
which was a news service founded
by Claude Barnett in 1919,

00:30:49.510 --> 00:30:54.020
which served 110 black
newspapers across the country

00:30:54.020 --> 00:30:56.110
and about 70 in West Africa,

00:30:56.110 --> 00:30:58.380
some of them Francophone,
Africa.

00:30:58.380 --> 00:31:04.000
So fortunately, Claude Barnett
needs a Washington bureau chief

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:05.300
at that time.

00:31:05.300 --> 00:31:07.060
His bureau chief is leaving.

00:31:07.060 --> 00:31:09.980
Alice prevails upon him
to give her a chance.

00:31:09.980 --> 00:31:14.660
Well, he's much rather have
a man, he makes that clear.

00:31:14.660 --> 00:31:18.280
But he can't get a man.

00:31:18.280 --> 00:31:21.820
His letters -- which are at the
Chicago Historical Society --

00:31:21.820 --> 00:31:26.360
show that he offered two
men much greater salaries

00:31:26.360 --> 00:31:28.570
than he ever paid Alice.

00:31:28.570 --> 00:31:30.300
But he gives her a chance.

00:31:30.300 --> 00:31:37.560
And he'll prove, as time goes
on, Claude Barnett is a sexist.

00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:42.980
But so was just about every
other newspaperman in existence.

00:31:42.980 --> 00:31:48.650
So he offers her one
half cent a word.

00:31:48.650 --> 00:31:50.440
She tries that for a week.

00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:54.050
She makes about 25 bucks and she
says, nobody can live on this.

00:31:54.050 --> 00:31:56.760
So he doubles it to one
penny a word for his stories.

00:31:56.760 --> 00:31:58.990
Believe me, she was prolific.

00:31:58.990 --> 00:32:01.960
So finally, he offers
her a salary.

00:32:01.960 --> 00:32:05.160
But as I said, never as
much as he offered a man.

00:32:05.160 --> 00:32:07.830
Well, you know, where's
the mystery there?

00:32:07.830 --> 00:32:11.790
According to the latest
report on pay parity for women

00:32:11.790 --> 00:32:16.720
in this country, it will be
2058 before we reach pay parity

00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:18.020
across the board.

00:32:18.020 --> 00:32:19.320
I won't be alive then.

00:32:19.320 --> 00:32:20.810
So what's up with that?

00:32:20.810 --> 00:32:22.530
This is just nothing new.

00:32:22.530 --> 00:32:24.260
But there was nothing
she could do about it.

00:32:24.260 --> 00:32:27.170
She was very grateful
to have the job.

00:32:27.170 --> 00:32:30.290
So Claude Barnett's method

00:32:30.290 --> 00:32:34.530
of covering the news is
mainly clip and paste.

00:32:34.530 --> 00:32:38.140
You know, clip the white papers,
send off stories, talk to maids,

00:32:38.140 --> 00:32:39.440
talk to butlers, talk

00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:42.820
to chauffeurs, talk
to court clerks.

00:32:42.820 --> 00:32:45.590
And not to make a pain
in the neck of yourself.

00:32:45.590 --> 00:32:48.770
This was not Alice's
way of proceeding.

00:32:48.770 --> 00:32:51.800
She wanted to be wherever
the white press was.

00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:54.260
So she tells him, that's
what she's going to do.

00:32:54.260 --> 00:32:57.140
Okay, he just, okay.

00:32:57.140 --> 00:33:01.580
So her first assignment is
to cover the Senate debate

00:33:01.580 --> 00:33:06.410
over the ouster of Senator
Theodore Bilbo of Mississippi

00:33:06.410 --> 00:33:11.140
for conduct unbecoming a senator
campaign-finance irregularities.

00:33:11.140 --> 00:33:13.080
She goes to Capitol Hill.

00:33:13.080 --> 00:33:16.670
She's waiting in this long line
of spectators who want to get in

00:33:16.670 --> 00:33:18.400
and see the proceedings.

00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:19.720
And she's so frustrated.

00:33:19.720 --> 00:33:23.970
She realizes she'll never get
in in time to get her story.

00:33:23.970 --> 00:33:27.750
And then she also finds out --
even if she had gotten in --

00:33:27.750 --> 00:33:30.510
it's against the rules to take
notes while you're in there.

00:33:30.510 --> 00:33:33.500
But she sees these men
walking by and going

00:33:33.500 --> 00:33:36.800
up a stairway that's
cordoned off with red velvet

00:33:36.800 --> 00:33:39.160
with two capitol
policemen standing there.

00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:41.770
And she realizes,
they're newsmen.

00:33:41.770 --> 00:33:43.800
So she says, here I go.

00:33:43.800 --> 00:33:45.100
She follows them.

00:33:45.100 --> 00:33:47.060
The cops stop her and say,
where do you think you're going?

00:33:47.060 --> 00:33:49.440
She says, I'm going
wherever you they're going.

00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:51.900
So the cop says, well, I don't
think you belong up there,

00:33:51.900 --> 00:33:54.020
but if not, they'll
let you know.

00:33:54.020 --> 00:33:55.320
She goes up the stairs.

00:33:55.320 --> 00:33:57.150
She opens the doors.

00:33:57.150 --> 00:33:58.640
And she's looking upon --

00:33:58.640 --> 00:34:01.270
this is a woman who does not
have an office in Washington.

00:34:01.270 --> 00:34:02.570
No secretary.

00:34:02.570 --> 00:34:03.870
No typewriter.

00:34:03.870 --> 00:34:05.170
No wire service.

00:34:05.170 --> 00:34:08.500
Here is this fantastic layout

00:34:08.500 --> 00:34:10.990
for members of the
Capitol Press.

00:34:10.990 --> 00:34:12.910
They have Western
Union machines.

00:34:12.910 --> 00:34:15.060
They have lounge chairs.

00:34:15.060 --> 00:34:16.490
They have mimeograph.

00:34:16.490 --> 00:34:19.120
They have forms for
sending in their copy.

00:34:19.120 --> 00:34:20.420
And then beyond that,

00:34:20.420 --> 00:34:24.040
those doors through which
they enter the galley

00:34:24.040 --> 00:34:26.600
and can watch the proceedings.

00:34:26.600 --> 00:34:29.610
And a man comes up to her
and asks her she's doing

00:34:29.610 --> 00:34:31.950
and she says, well, I came

00:34:31.950 --> 00:34:34.670
to watch the debate
of Senator Bilbo.

00:34:34.670 --> 00:34:36.550
And he says, well, you
have to be a member.

00:34:36.550 --> 00:34:39.430
She's says, fine, how
do I become a member?

00:34:39.430 --> 00:34:42.030
And he says, well, we actually
have too many members now,

00:34:42.030 --> 00:34:44.070
there isn't enough
room for all of them.

00:34:44.070 --> 00:34:45.450
And she says, really?

00:34:45.450 --> 00:34:47.920
And how many of them are Negro?

00:34:47.920 --> 00:34:55.090
Well, actually -- so he
gives her a form to fill out.

00:34:55.090 --> 00:34:59.810
Well, it turns out, there's no
rule against a black member.

00:34:59.810 --> 00:35:02.680
But the rule is what we
call disparate impact.

00:35:02.680 --> 00:35:07.180
It says, you have to be a
writer for the daily press.

00:35:07.180 --> 00:35:09.110
All the black papers
at that time,

00:35:09.110 --> 00:35:14.310
except perhaps the Atlanta Daily
World, were weekly newspapers,

00:35:14.310 --> 00:35:16.850
ergo, no black members.

00:35:16.850 --> 00:35:19.690
Well, she campaigns, campaigns.

00:35:19.690 --> 00:35:22.790
She calls Claude Barnett and
says, I want to go after this.

00:35:22.790 --> 00:35:24.090
I want your backing.

00:35:24.090 --> 00:35:26.760
And he says, what makes you
think that you, a woman,

00:35:26.760 --> 00:35:30.400
can get in where men have not
succeeded all these years?

00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:32.420
And she says, well,
I'm going to try.

00:35:32.420 --> 00:35:35.850
So she does and she actually
gets the rule changed.

00:35:35.850 --> 00:35:41.080
They change the rule to
allow the weekly press in.

00:35:41.080 --> 00:35:43.220
But she's not the
first one admitted.

00:35:43.220 --> 00:35:48.570
Because Claude Barnett is so
sure she's not going to make it,

00:35:48.570 --> 00:35:52.360
he doesn't send in the necessary
letter of recommendation.

00:35:52.360 --> 00:35:55.540
So Louis Lautier, who
works for the competing

00:35:55.540 --> 00:35:58.550
at the time called Negro
Newspaper Publishers

00:35:58.550 --> 00:36:03.160
Association, he's the first one
in, she's the second member.

00:36:03.160 --> 00:36:04.790
Well, she goes on
from there, she says,

00:36:04.790 --> 00:36:06.160
how about the White House?

00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:08.990
She goes down to -- the House

00:36:08.990 --> 00:36:11.470
and Senate are Republican
controlled.

00:36:11.470 --> 00:36:13.480
She goes down to the
Democratic-controlled White

00:36:13.480 --> 00:36:15.760
House and she says, well, this
is what the Republicans did

00:36:15.760 --> 00:36:17.920
for us, what are
you going to do?

00:36:17.920 --> 00:36:21.430
And Charlie Ross, who's Truman's
press secretary, he says,

00:36:21.430 --> 00:36:23.620
no problem, just
send in a letter.

00:36:23.620 --> 00:36:25.460
So she does and she
doesn't even ask

00:36:25.460 --> 00:36:27.340
for Claude Barnett's support.

00:36:27.340 --> 00:36:29.510
So she gets into the
White House Press Corps.

00:36:29.510 --> 00:36:31.870
She's the first black
woman admitted.

00:36:31.870 --> 00:36:36.660
And then shortly after, she
notices in the press room,

00:36:36.660 --> 00:36:41.800
a notice that the president is
going to take an 18 state tour,

00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:44.690
whistle stop tour, of the West.

00:36:44.690 --> 00:36:47.280
It's considered nonpolitical.

00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:49.870
But, of course, it's
just the preparatory

00:36:49.870 --> 00:36:52.610
to his deciding he's
going to be a candidate

00:36:52.610 --> 00:36:55.410
for his own four-year term.

00:36:55.410 --> 00:36:57.950
So she says, well, I want to go.

00:36:57.950 --> 00:37:00.810
So how do I how do this?

00:37:00.810 --> 00:37:05.170
So Charlie Ross says, no
problem, just sign up,

00:37:05.170 --> 00:37:07.770
and it's $1000 per reporter.

00:37:07.770 --> 00:37:11.720
Well, she tries not
to show her surprise.

00:37:11.720 --> 00:37:16.250
She assumed that the White
House would pay the way

00:37:16.250 --> 00:37:18.910
for any reporter
that went along.

00:37:18.910 --> 00:37:23.450
He told her no, no, each press
outlet pays their own way.

00:37:23.450 --> 00:37:26.910
So she goes back and she
calls Claude Barnett herself

00:37:26.910 --> 00:37:28.220
long distance.

00:37:28.220 --> 00:37:32.450
And Claude Barnett says,
this is not the kind

00:37:32.450 --> 00:37:34.010
of trip a woman takes.

00:37:34.010 --> 00:37:37.390
And she says, I want to go.

00:37:37.390 --> 00:37:41.590
And he says, well, is
it worth $1000 to you?

00:37:41.590 --> 00:37:42.890
And she says, yes.

00:37:42.890 --> 00:37:44.650
And he says, well, it
isn't worth it to me

00:37:44.650 --> 00:37:47.220
or any of my member papers.

00:37:47.220 --> 00:37:49.200
Well, she says, I'm
going anyway,

00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:50.760
as long as I have
your permission.

00:37:50.760 --> 00:37:52.420
Obviously she needs his consent

00:37:52.420 --> 00:37:55.020
because she needs
the credentials.

00:37:55.020 --> 00:37:58.500
So he says, okay, I'll
ask my largest newspaper.

00:37:58.500 --> 00:38:00.880
So he consults the
Chicago Defender,

00:38:00.880 --> 00:38:04.260
the Pittsburgh Courier, and
the Norfolk Journal and Guide.

00:38:04.260 --> 00:38:07.310
The latter is not
interested at all.

00:38:07.310 --> 00:38:10.700
The other two, who were
highly competitive, say, well,

00:38:10.700 --> 00:38:13.990
we might as well
send our own, man.

00:38:13.990 --> 00:38:16.520
So they send two men
along on this trip.

00:38:16.520 --> 00:38:18.630
So now there's three
black members

00:38:18.630 --> 00:38:21.080
of the press going
and one woman.

00:38:21.080 --> 00:38:25.270
Doris Fleeson, who was
reporting for the New York Post,

00:38:25.270 --> 00:38:27.020
she went along only to Detroit.

00:38:27.020 --> 00:38:28.320
So for most of the trip,

00:38:28.320 --> 00:38:31.890
Alice is the only woman
on the whole trip.

00:38:31.890 --> 00:38:34.430
Well, she's newly
arrived in Washington.

00:38:34.430 --> 00:38:37.350
She's never covered
anything like this.

00:38:37.350 --> 00:38:40.710
You can imagine, getting
into an assignment like this

00:38:40.710 --> 00:38:42.930
without any experience.

00:38:42.930 --> 00:38:45.710
So she goes to this
car on the train

00:38:45.710 --> 00:38:48.840
where they mimeograph all
the president's speeches

00:38:48.840 --> 00:38:52.190
and they have canned
background reports and all kinds

00:38:52.190 --> 00:38:54.780
of paper everywhere, and
she's trying to gather

00:38:54.780 --> 00:38:56.920
up every little bit
of information.

00:38:56.920 --> 00:39:01.270
And then Eddie Folliard,
Pulitzer prize-winning reporter

00:39:01.270 --> 00:39:05.050
for the Washington Post -- who
had covered every president back

00:39:05.050 --> 00:39:09.230
to Calvin Coolidge -- he comes
up to her and he says, Alice,

00:39:09.230 --> 00:39:11.220
you don't do it that way.

00:39:11.220 --> 00:39:14.110
I'll tell you how to
cover this kind of trip.

00:39:14.110 --> 00:39:16.840
You get off the train
at every stop,

00:39:16.840 --> 00:39:18.460
you mingle with the people.

00:39:18.460 --> 00:39:20.200
You ask them questions.

00:39:20.200 --> 00:39:21.560
You get quotes.

00:39:21.560 --> 00:39:23.440
You kind of take their pulse

00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:26.860
on how they feel
about the president.

00:39:26.860 --> 00:39:30.460
And that's what makes
your story unusual.

00:39:30.460 --> 00:39:33.080
So pretty soon she's
writing and true,

00:39:33.080 --> 00:39:35.160
as she called it,
Folliard style.

00:39:35.160 --> 00:39:38.330
But she's got another challenge.

00:39:38.330 --> 00:39:41.590
She's writing for
only the Black Press.

00:39:41.590 --> 00:39:44.960
So as Claude Barnett
makes perfectly clear,

00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:47.550
she's got to have a black angle.

00:39:47.550 --> 00:39:52.090
Well, in many of these towns out
West, there weren't any blacks.

00:39:52.090 --> 00:39:54.480
So she didn't a black angle.

00:39:54.480 --> 00:39:58.690
So she was not about
to have no story.

00:39:58.690 --> 00:40:02.450
Most of these stops, the other
two guys from Chicago and Pitts,

00:40:02.450 --> 00:40:04.290
they didn't even bother
to get off the train.

00:40:04.290 --> 00:40:06.960
They figured no black angle.

00:40:06.960 --> 00:40:09.000
Alice found a black angle.

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:15.390
She writes, there was not
a single Negro in the crowd

00:40:15.390 --> 00:40:19.320
at such and such a place
when such and such happened.

00:40:19.320 --> 00:40:22.470
And then she'd go on with
whatever interesting happened

00:40:22.470 --> 00:40:24.550
in that town.

00:40:24.550 --> 00:40:27.130
Well, then one night
in Missoula, Montana,

00:40:27.130 --> 00:40:30.140
a college town -- they weren't
supposed to stop at all.

00:40:30.140 --> 00:40:33.180
It was midnight and
everybody had gone to bed.

00:40:33.180 --> 00:40:36.080
But they got word that a
crowd of college students,

00:40:36.080 --> 00:40:39.880
several hundred, had gathered
along the tracks in hopes

00:40:39.880 --> 00:40:41.180
of seeing the president.

00:40:41.180 --> 00:40:45.470
And Harry Truman comes
out on that platform

00:40:45.470 --> 00:40:47.370
at the end of the last car.

00:40:47.370 --> 00:40:49.140
They stop the train.

00:40:49.140 --> 00:40:52.920
And in his pajamas and
robe, Harry Truman talks

00:40:52.920 --> 00:40:56.240
to the students, and
then he takes questions.

00:40:56.240 --> 00:40:59.710
Now, up to this point, nobody
had mentioned civil rights.

00:40:59.710 --> 00:41:04.510
Civil rights was
not popular in 1947

00:41:04.510 --> 00:41:06.640
and for several years
thereafter.

00:41:06.640 --> 00:41:09.110
So the politician
didn't bring it up.

00:41:09.110 --> 00:41:11.300
But one of those students did.

00:41:11.300 --> 00:41:13.540
All of a sudden a hand
goes up in the crowd

00:41:13.540 --> 00:41:16.480
and this young man
yells, Mr. President,

00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:19.010
what do you say about
civil rights?

00:41:19.010 --> 00:41:22.800
And the President shoots back,
I say civil rights is as old

00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:25.140
as the Constitution and as new

00:41:25.140 --> 00:41:28.480
as the Democratic
platform of 1944.

00:41:28.480 --> 00:41:32.120
And then he intimates
that it will be included

00:41:32.120 --> 00:41:35.280
in the platform of 1948.

00:41:35.280 --> 00:41:38.340
And Alice has her
story, a nice exclusive.

00:41:38.340 --> 00:41:43.440
And the headline is, pajama clad
President defend civil rights

00:41:43.440 --> 00:41:44.950
at midnight.

00:41:44.950 --> 00:41:46.480
Well, they go on.

00:41:46.480 --> 00:41:50.960
There is only one nasty -- oh,
it only last a minute or so --

00:41:50.960 --> 00:41:54.770
racial incident, out
in Cheyenne, Wyoming.

00:41:54.770 --> 00:41:57.940
And it's handled and
Alice is cool with it.

00:41:57.940 --> 00:41:59.510
Everything is fine.

00:41:59.510 --> 00:42:03.770
A few days later, she's
sitting in her compartment

00:42:03.770 --> 00:42:05.320
at the end of the day.

00:42:05.320 --> 00:42:07.250
There's no stops scheduled.

00:42:07.250 --> 00:42:09.640
She kicks off her
shoes and puts her feet

00:42:09.640 --> 00:42:12.560
up on the seat opposite hers.

00:42:12.560 --> 00:42:14.930
And she takes one of those
little tray tables and puts it

00:42:14.930 --> 00:42:18.030
across her lap, puts the
typewriter on her lap,

00:42:18.030 --> 00:42:20.460
and starts to bang out her copy.

00:42:20.460 --> 00:42:25.410
There's a little tap on the
door and the door opens,

00:42:25.410 --> 00:42:27.600
and it's President Truman.

00:42:27.600 --> 00:42:33.840
And he says, I heard you
had some trouble back there.

00:42:33.840 --> 00:42:36.360
And if anything ever
happens again,

00:42:36.360 --> 00:42:40.630
I want you to make
sure I'm told about it.

00:42:40.630 --> 00:42:44.070
And Alice is just never
the same after that.

00:42:44.070 --> 00:42:46.670
She never felt so
secure in her life.

00:42:46.670 --> 00:42:48.920
And she never felt so that --

00:42:48.920 --> 00:42:51.940
you know, here's the
President coming to me.

00:42:51.940 --> 00:42:55.510
And I can do fine
in any audience --

00:42:55.510 --> 00:42:59.160
and this kind of
thing, experience,

00:42:59.160 --> 00:43:01.130
it really fits her very well.

00:43:01.130 --> 00:43:05.290
Later on when she's covering the
news conferences, she does fine

00:43:05.290 --> 00:43:06.770
at Truman's news conferences,

00:43:06.770 --> 00:43:08.570
which are held in
the Oval Office.

00:43:08.570 --> 00:43:11.380
But then they grew
larger and moved next door

00:43:11.380 --> 00:43:13.160
to the old executive
office building,

00:43:13.160 --> 00:43:15.100
which was the State Department.

00:43:15.100 --> 00:43:17.440
And Eisenhower held
them in the Treaty Room.

00:43:17.440 --> 00:43:22.030
Well, she carried forward
through her same protocol,

00:43:22.030 --> 00:43:24.750
which was to bring forward
civil rights issues.

00:43:24.750 --> 00:43:27.400
Because none of the white
press ever raised a civil

00:43:27.400 --> 00:43:29.310
rights issue.

00:43:29.310 --> 00:43:32.000
So each time she would bring

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:35.060
to light some problem
going on in the government.

00:43:35.060 --> 00:43:38.900
Questions like, is the
administration going

00:43:38.900 --> 00:43:41.840
to do anything about the
situation at the Bureau

00:43:41.840 --> 00:43:49.180
of Engraving, where apprentice
plate makers are not admitting

00:43:49.180 --> 00:43:51.010
black apprentices.

00:43:51.010 --> 00:43:54.920
And this Federal Employment
Practices Committee has found

00:43:54.920 --> 00:43:57.670
that that's a violation
of their civil rights

00:43:57.670 --> 00:44:00.640
and the Civil Service
Commission has agreed.

00:44:00.640 --> 00:44:03.310
But the Bureau Engraving
isn't doing anything.

00:44:03.310 --> 00:44:07.140
So Alice brings this up
at a news conference.

00:44:07.140 --> 00:44:08.440
And the President gets annoyed.

00:44:08.440 --> 00:44:12.260
Eisenhower had a very short
fuse at these conferences.

00:44:12.260 --> 00:44:16.090
As he explained in his staff
explained, he wanted to be able

00:44:16.090 --> 00:44:18.280
to answer any question
that came up.

00:44:18.280 --> 00:44:20.810
So he wanted to know the field.

00:44:20.810 --> 00:44:23.350
He didn't know much
about civil rights.

00:44:23.350 --> 00:44:26.170
And it was, you know,
controversial,

00:44:26.170 --> 00:44:28.780
he really didn't want
to answer questions.

00:44:28.780 --> 00:44:31.590
Every question she asked
was along those lines.

00:44:31.590 --> 00:44:34.700
Finally she was asked to submit
her questions in advance.

00:44:34.700 --> 00:44:36.660
But she wasn't about
really to do that.

00:44:36.660 --> 00:44:39.120
She tried it once,
it didn't work,

00:44:39.120 --> 00:44:42.250
and she realized
she was being had.

00:44:42.250 --> 00:44:45.690
But Eisenhower had his own
way of dealing with it.

00:44:45.690 --> 00:44:49.840
He completely ignored her
for the rest of his term.

00:44:49.840 --> 00:44:53.790
In his first few years, he
had called on her four, five,

00:44:53.790 --> 00:44:56.510
six times at these
news conferences.

00:44:56.510 --> 00:44:58.870
Which was a pretty good rate.

00:44:58.870 --> 00:45:00.530
And then nothing.

00:45:00.530 --> 00:45:03.910
Alice became the invisible woman

00:45:03.910 --> 00:45:06.050
at Eisenhower's news
conferences.

00:45:06.050 --> 00:45:09.220
To the effect, she would
stand up like everybody else,

00:45:09.220 --> 00:45:11.440
Mr. President, Mr. President.

00:45:11.440 --> 00:45:13.830
One white reporter
says to her after one

00:45:13.830 --> 00:45:15.130
of the news conferences,

00:45:15.130 --> 00:45:17.540
do you realize how many times
you were on your feet today?

00:45:17.540 --> 00:45:19.970
And she says, no,
I wasn't counting.

00:45:19.970 --> 00:45:21.840
And he says, 15.

00:45:21.840 --> 00:45:23.660
Well, finally it
makes the White Press.

00:45:23.660 --> 00:45:28.150
Drew Pearson, the
columnist, several newspapers,

00:45:28.150 --> 00:45:31.430
they point out that Eisenhower
is ignoring this member

00:45:31.430 --> 00:45:33.610
of the Black Press deliberately.

00:45:33.610 --> 00:45:36.330
Well, he calls on her a few
years later when they're going

00:45:36.330 --> 00:45:39.910
to televise, tape for
television, a news conference,

00:45:39.910 --> 00:45:45.440
because he wants to show that he
recognizes a black news person.

00:45:45.440 --> 00:45:49.550
But other than that,
he ignores her.

00:45:49.550 --> 00:45:53.210
And then, she takes a
leave of absence to work

00:45:53.210 --> 00:45:55.290
in the Kennedy campaign.

00:45:55.290 --> 00:45:58.830
Then she goes back
after Kennedy is elected

00:45:58.830 --> 00:46:02.290
to covering the White House.

00:46:02.290 --> 00:46:10.380
Eight minutes into his first
news conference in January 1961,

00:46:10.380 --> 00:46:15.590
JFK calls on Alice Dunnigan,
the first black woman,

00:46:15.590 --> 00:46:17.730
first black reporter
to be called

00:46:17.730 --> 00:46:19.860
on in this news conference.

00:46:19.860 --> 00:46:23.890
And she says in her
lovely Kentucky drawl --

00:46:23.890 --> 00:46:28.350
which I cannot imitate
because I am from the Bronx.

00:46:28.350 --> 00:46:31.930
She says, Mr. President, does
your administration intend

00:46:31.930 --> 00:46:36.860
to do anything to help the
black farmers of Fayette County,

00:46:36.860 --> 00:46:40.900
Tennessee, who dared to
vote in the last election

00:46:40.900 --> 00:46:43.850
and have been evicted
from their homes

00:46:43.850 --> 00:46:47.210
and are now forced
to live in tents?

00:46:47.210 --> 00:46:53.630
And without hesitation, JFK
comes back with, yes, we do.

00:46:53.630 --> 00:46:55.730
I supported the Civil
Rights Act,

00:46:55.730 --> 00:47:00.700
referring to the Civil Rights
Act such as it was of 1958,

00:47:00.700 --> 00:47:03.010
and the Justice Department
is charged

00:47:03.010 --> 00:47:06.330
with enforcing the voting
rights of every American.

00:47:06.330 --> 00:47:11.790
And we intend to pursue
this situation with vigor.

00:47:11.790 --> 00:47:15.350
And thus ends Alice
Dunnigan's purdah

00:47:15.350 --> 00:47:17.500
at White House news conferences.

00:47:17.500 --> 00:47:20.170
Shortly after that,
she leaves the press

00:47:20.170 --> 00:47:22.810
and gets a political
appointment.

00:47:22.810 --> 00:47:26.160
And from then on, she can
at least live decently,

00:47:26.160 --> 00:47:28.900
because it's been hand to
mouth, pointing her watch

00:47:28.900 --> 00:47:33.200
on Fridays, and a rough life.

00:47:33.200 --> 00:47:36.320
And finally she becomes
a government employee.

00:47:36.320 --> 00:47:41.530
And she lives out
till she was 77.

00:47:41.530 --> 00:47:43.540
She writes her memoirs.

00:47:43.540 --> 00:47:48.470
And the problem is, it's
very popular at the time.

00:47:48.470 --> 00:47:50.690
And the Black Press,
she gets very good press

00:47:50.690 --> 00:47:53.460
from the Africo-American.

00:47:53.460 --> 00:47:57.420
But now the book is
largely unavailable.

00:47:57.420 --> 00:47:59.960
And so it brings me here today.

00:47:59.960 --> 00:48:02.270
And I'd be delighted
to take your questions.

00:48:02.270 --> 00:48:04.620
I hope I haven't
run on too long.

00:48:04.620 --> 00:48:06.420
Thank you.

00:48:06.420 --> 00:48:11.270
[ Applause ]

00:48:11.270 --> 00:48:13.380
Any questions?

00:48:13.380 --> 00:48:14.680
Yes.

00:48:14.680 --> 00:48:16.510
&gt;&gt; Can you talk about the
picture that was up that's

00:48:16.510 --> 00:48:17.850
on the front of the book?

00:48:17.850 --> 00:48:19.430
&gt;&gt; I'd be delighted.

00:48:19.430 --> 00:48:23.410
That picture was taken
by Scurlock Studios.

00:48:23.410 --> 00:48:28.430
Now, Addison Scurlock started
a photography studio here

00:48:28.430 --> 00:48:30.780
in Washington, as the Museum

00:48:30.780 --> 00:48:36.350
of African-American History
is well aware, in 1911.

00:48:36.350 --> 00:48:40.080
And in the late '30s,
he was joined

00:48:40.080 --> 00:48:43.240
by his two sons,
Robert and George.

00:48:43.240 --> 00:48:45.650
And they became the
photographers

00:48:45.650 --> 00:48:47.090
of the black middle class.

00:48:47.090 --> 00:48:49.330
There are fantastic
pictures of people

00:48:49.330 --> 00:48:52.160
like Ralph Bunche,
etcetera, etcetera.

00:48:52.160 --> 00:48:54.890
I mean, that was the
studio you went to.

00:48:54.890 --> 00:48:58.780
And Alice commissioned or,
you know, she hired one

00:48:58.780 --> 00:49:01.240
of the Scurlocks, I don't know
if it was Robert or George --

00:49:01.240 --> 00:49:04.990
I'm thinking probably Robert
-- to take this picture.

00:49:04.990 --> 00:49:09.770
And then she would send it
out to the members of the ANP,

00:49:09.770 --> 00:49:14.110
let them know that she was
there person here in Washington.

00:49:14.110 --> 00:49:16.750
There's one curious
little thing.

00:49:16.750 --> 00:49:19.890
If you look on the cover
of the book, this picture,

00:49:19.890 --> 00:49:22.700
she's holding --
and you can see it.

00:49:22.700 --> 00:49:25.490
She's holding the
Washington Post.

00:49:25.490 --> 00:49:31.170
And there's a story in there,
but I don't know what it is.

00:49:31.170 --> 00:49:35.490
Because the Washington Post did
not have any black reporters

00:49:35.490 --> 00:49:37.710
until 1951.

00:49:37.710 --> 00:49:40.330
And I know that because
my husband, Simeon Booker,

00:49:40.330 --> 00:49:43.930
was the first black reporter
that Phil Graham brought in.

00:49:43.930 --> 00:49:48.080
And it was two years --
very, very difficult years.

00:49:48.080 --> 00:49:51.430
Because the newsroom was not
ready, despite the intentions

00:49:51.430 --> 00:49:54.560
of the management of the Post.

00:49:54.560 --> 00:49:56.750
And then he left
and went to Chicago

00:49:56.750 --> 00:49:58.780
and joined Jet and
Ebony magazines.

00:49:58.780 --> 00:50:01.070
But I'm just wondering
if Alice was trying

00:50:01.070 --> 00:50:04.530
to identify the scenes so that
people wouldn't think it was any

00:50:04.530 --> 00:50:09.230
ole state capital behind her,
or if there was a little joke

00:50:09.230 --> 00:50:11.270
in there, I don't know.

00:50:11.270 --> 00:50:13.510
But anyway, she's holding
the Washington Post,

00:50:13.510 --> 00:50:15.790
and it's a lovely picture.

00:50:15.790 --> 00:50:17.090
Yes?

00:50:17.090 --> 00:50:18.390
&gt;&gt; Did she ever marry
or have any children?

00:50:18.390 --> 00:50:20.660
&gt;&gt; Yes, Alice married twice.

00:50:20.660 --> 00:50:22.510
She was Alice Allison.

00:50:22.510 --> 00:50:23.810
She married twice.

00:50:23.810 --> 00:50:25.430
The first was when
she was only 19.

00:50:25.430 --> 00:50:29.500
After one year in
rural Mount Pisgah.

00:50:29.500 --> 00:50:31.540
She married the church organist.

00:50:31.540 --> 00:50:33.820
And he seemed to
be so supportive

00:50:33.820 --> 00:50:36.340
and such a lovely young man.

00:50:36.340 --> 00:50:39.600
But it didn't take
long before it turned

00:50:39.600 --> 00:50:43.430
out he was not only a
mama's boy, he wanted her

00:50:43.430 --> 00:50:47.380
to leave teaching and come join
the family as sharecroppers.

00:50:47.380 --> 00:50:50.580
She had worked all of her
life to get out of that.

00:50:50.580 --> 00:50:52.750
She wasn't about to give it up.

00:50:52.750 --> 00:50:55.900
And you only taught school
five months out of the year,

00:50:55.900 --> 00:50:58.270
the rest of the time the
kids were in the fields.

00:50:58.270 --> 00:51:00.860
So the rest of the time,
she had to earn money.

00:51:00.860 --> 00:51:03.940
So they would work as --
she would be a laundress.

00:51:03.940 --> 00:51:05.500
She would take care
of the dairy.

00:51:05.500 --> 00:51:08.950
She would take care
of white children.

00:51:08.950 --> 00:51:11.790
Cleaned white families' homes.

00:51:11.790 --> 00:51:13.790
Whatever needed to be done.

00:51:13.790 --> 00:51:16.480
But they had a very,
very hard time.

00:51:16.480 --> 00:51:18.660
And her clothes became
so shabby --

00:51:18.660 --> 00:51:22.400
and clothing to Alice was
a symbol of her dignity,

00:51:22.400 --> 00:51:25.240
your status, the
respect that due you.

00:51:25.240 --> 00:51:29.520
And when her shoes became
so shabby, she was ashamed

00:51:29.520 --> 00:51:31.830
to go to Sunday school.

00:51:31.830 --> 00:51:34.850
She told her husband
Walter, I'm not going.

00:51:34.850 --> 00:51:37.620
And she said, I can't show up
in school looking this way.

00:51:37.620 --> 00:51:40.690
And he said, I don't care if
you never leave the house again.

00:51:40.690 --> 00:51:42.710
Oh, he was just dreadful.

00:51:42.710 --> 00:51:45.820
And then two weeks later, she
said, well, this isn't working.

00:51:45.820 --> 00:51:48.970
So she said, I'll show you, I'm
going to Sunday school anyway,

00:51:48.970 --> 00:51:52.260
and let people see these
shabby shoes, and they'll know

00:51:52.260 --> 00:51:54.630
that you won't let
me get decent shoes.

00:51:54.630 --> 00:51:57.050
And he said I thought the most
astonishing thing, he said,

00:51:57.050 --> 00:51:59.560
I don't care if you go to
church looking like the devil.

00:51:59.560 --> 00:52:04.770
So Alice -- then she has
to go back to school.

00:52:04.770 --> 00:52:09.180
And to do that, she has to stay
in another town for the week

00:52:09.180 --> 00:52:10.480
and then come home on weekends.

00:52:10.480 --> 00:52:12.700
Well, he's not going to have
anything to do with that

00:52:12.700 --> 00:52:15.770
and he tells her, if she
leaves, she can just stay away.

00:52:15.770 --> 00:52:18.560
And she says, well,
that's an idea.

00:52:18.560 --> 00:52:26.600
And after five years, from
19 till the age of 24,

00:52:26.600 --> 00:52:29.600
she and Walter split up.

00:52:29.600 --> 00:52:36.610
A year later, a young man who
was five years older than she --

00:52:36.610 --> 00:52:38.720
two years younger than
her brother and played

00:52:38.720 --> 00:52:41.190
with her brother but
didn't want anything to do

00:52:41.190 --> 00:52:45.090
with little Alice -- Charles
Dunnigan comes back to town,

00:52:45.090 --> 00:52:49.410
having left school in the sixth
grade and gone off to the north,

00:52:49.410 --> 00:52:52.160
become very worldly,
married, widowed.

00:52:52.160 --> 00:52:54.020
He comes back to town.

00:52:54.020 --> 00:52:58.740
And you can imagine how much
more worldly he would seem

00:52:58.740 --> 00:53:04.510
and how much more, you
know, glamorous to Alice.

00:53:04.510 --> 00:53:09.700
And she's educated and he's
sort of educated by the world.

00:53:09.700 --> 00:53:13.180
And they decide to get married.

00:53:13.180 --> 00:53:16.630
Well, then she has her
first child, Robert.

00:53:16.630 --> 00:53:19.330
Who lives out in Suitland.

00:53:19.330 --> 00:53:21.880
A delightful man who loves
his mother but was raised

00:53:21.880 --> 00:53:24.290
by his grandparents
because it was tough times,

00:53:24.290 --> 00:53:29.730
and for her to keep working as
a teacher, she took the help

00:53:29.730 --> 00:53:31.440
from her parents to
raise the little boy.

00:53:31.440 --> 00:53:33.680
So that was Charles Dunnigan.

00:53:33.680 --> 00:53:39.070
But then the Depression came
and Charles didn't have a job.

00:53:39.070 --> 00:53:42.970
And he couldn't stand the
shame of not being able

00:53:42.970 --> 00:53:44.680
to support his family.

00:53:44.680 --> 00:53:45.980
And so he leaves.

00:53:45.980 --> 00:53:47.280
He kept leaving.

00:53:47.280 --> 00:53:49.380
He'd come back and
then he'd leave again.

00:53:49.380 --> 00:53:53.890
And so it was this system
really in both situations

00:53:53.890 --> 00:53:55.760
that destroyed Alice's marriage.

00:53:55.760 --> 00:53:57.730
It wasn't -- and
I'm telling you,

00:53:57.730 --> 00:54:00.160
they were some good-looking
dudes.

00:54:00.160 --> 00:54:04.440
But once you got past that,
there was nothing in common,

00:54:04.440 --> 00:54:07.670
nothing to keep the marriage
together and keep it going,

00:54:07.670 --> 00:54:09.900
although she tried very hard.

00:54:09.900 --> 00:54:14.660
Any more questions?

00:54:15.910 --> 00:54:19.320
Well, I'm sure if
you read this book --

00:54:19.320 --> 00:54:21.780
and I can say since
I didn't write it,

00:54:21.780 --> 00:54:24.570
I only took the machete
and cut it shorter

00:54:24.570 --> 00:54:27.600
so that people would read it.

00:54:27.600 --> 00:54:31.120
I can say, you will fall in
love with Alice Dunnigan.

00:54:31.120 --> 00:54:32.920
Thank you.

00:54:32.920 --> 00:54:36.520
[ Applause ]

00:54:36.520 --> 00:54:40.560
&gt;&gt; Well, Carol, you've shared
not only the period of time

00:54:40.560 --> 00:54:43.920
in which this all occurred but
you've shared a lot of yourself

00:54:43.920 --> 00:54:46.520
that went into this book,
and we thank you for it.

00:54:46.520 --> 00:54:51.220
And we don't care if it was a
machete or a pair of scissors,

00:54:51.220 --> 00:54:53.340
you've brought her to life.

00:54:53.340 --> 00:54:55.720
And it's wonderful
to have you back.

00:54:55.720 --> 00:54:58.410
Now, there is going to be
a book signing in the back.

00:54:58.410 --> 00:55:02.440
And please have a chance to
talk to Carol a little more.

00:55:02.440 --> 00:55:04.540
And it's been a pleasure
to have you here.

00:55:04.540 --> 00:55:07.100
Outside on the table
there's also a schedule

00:55:07.100 --> 00:55:10.730
of future events coming up
for the Center for the Book

00:55:10.730 --> 00:55:15.010
and also a issue of the new
Library of Congress Magazine,

00:55:15.010 --> 00:55:17.860
which got put out just in
time for the Book Festival.

00:55:17.860 --> 00:55:21.990
It's a quarterly, but it's
devoted to the joy of reading.

00:55:21.990 --> 00:55:26.900
And a good chunk of that is
about, what, promoting reading

00:55:26.900 --> 00:55:31.300
and promoting books and
writing and writers and people

00:55:31.300 --> 00:55:35.150
like the person -- the
editor that we just met.

00:55:35.150 --> 00:55:36.960
So thanks for joining us.

00:55:36.960 --> 00:55:38.260
Pick up this.

00:55:38.260 --> 00:55:41.030
And let's give a final
round of applause to Carol.

00:55:41.030 --> 00:55:43.040
[ Applause ]

00:55:43.040 --> 00:55:46.640
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
