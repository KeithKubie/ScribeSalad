00:00:04.979 --> 00:00:11.589
Why Do Zippers Have YKK on Them?

00:00:11.589 --> 00:00:18.191
The YKK stands for Yoshida Kogyo Kabushikikaisha
(say that five times fast).

00:00:18.191 --> 00:00:24.869
In 1934 Tadao Yoshida founded Yoshida Kogyo
Kabushikikaisha (translated Yoshida Industries

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:25.869
Limited).

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:30.340
This company is now the world’s foremost
zipper manufacturer, making about 90% of all

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:34.520
zippers in over 206 facilities in 52 countries.

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:39.320
In fact, they not only make the zippers, they
also make the machines that make the zippers;

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.720
no word on if they make the machines that
make the parts that make up the machines that

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:45.020
make the zippers.

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:49.769
Their largest factory in Georgia makes over
7 million zippers per day.

00:00:49.769 --> 00:00:54.450
In any event, Mr. Yoshida’s company zipped
to number one by practicing the “Cycle of

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:56.100
Goodness”, as he called it.

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.280
Namely, “No one prospers unless he renders
benefit to others.”

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.809
Using this principle, he endeavored to create
the best zippers out there that would hold

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:07.590
up over long periods of time in the end product.

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.950
This in turn would benefit both the manufacturers
who used his zippers and the end customer

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:18.399
and because of these things benefit his company
with higher repeat and referral sales, thus

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:20.660
completing the “Cycle of Goodness” *zen
moment*

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:26.259
So next time you’re zipping up, take a moment
to remember Mr. Yoshida; also, if you’re

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:47.900
going commando, careful with Captain Winky
on the zip up.

00:01:47.900 --> 00:02:46.519
I can’t stress that enough.
