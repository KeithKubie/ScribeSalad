00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.722
Now you've gotten pretty good at working with simple loops and it's time to

00:00:03.722 --> 00:00:10.075
introduce another loop type. It often happens that you need to work with

00:00:10.075 --> 00:00:16.742
consecutive numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. I'll just give you an example. Let's say

00:00:16.742 --> 00:00:21.110
you want to write a to-do list. Maybe your and my to-do list is really complex.

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:24.958
So we'll start with something really simple. My cat, Eliza Doolittle. Her to-do

00:00:24.958 --> 00:00:30.080
list is stunningly simple, and you can program it. The first thing she does is

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:34.680
sleep. That's the second thing she does. And the third, and you guessed it.

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.971
Sleeping is what she does all day. Your task is to write a program using a

00:00:38.971 --> 00:00:42.439
while loop that prints this to do list.
