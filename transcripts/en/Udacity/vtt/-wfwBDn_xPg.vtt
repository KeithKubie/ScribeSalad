00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:04.510
Understanding objects, fields, and records is important to conceptualize

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:06.340
the data model that you're building in the music

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:09.520
festival app. Let's make sure you understand what's going

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:13.210
on. So, let's pretend that you're Amazon.com, and you

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:14.830
want to keep track of the inventory at a

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:19.030
warehouse. Your warehouse stocks lots of things, books, movies,

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:22.180
clothing, et cetera. But you refer to the individual

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:25.920
things as an item. Each item has some properties

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.935
like a name, a price, and a weight. For

00:00:28.935 --> 00:00:32.055
example, a Udacity t-shirt costs $15 and weighs six

00:00:32.055 --> 00:00:35.120
ounces. If you were to represent this in Sales

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.800
Force, what would each of these capitalized terms correspond to?
