00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.430
So, we have our Set Time object, and we've

00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:05.290
created that relationship between Set Time to Bands and Stages.

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:06.245
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:00:06.245 --> 00:00:09.340
&gt;&gt; Now, that's great, but there are probably a few other things about

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:12.510
Set Time that we want to track, like, for example, we took that Pic-less

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:14.990
field that was a list of times and now turned it into this

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:17.850
whole object, so we probably want to track

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.430
what times these bands are playing at.

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:20.120
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:24.070
&gt;&gt; Or, maybe the status of what's going on with the set time link?

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:25.150
&gt;&gt; It was cancelled or

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:25.980
confirmed or whatever.

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.660
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So we can do that right there

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.360
from the Schema Builder and keep building out our object.
