1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:01,800
And all these things that we talked about,
this,

2
00:00:01,801 --> 00:00:05,420
this word meaning that we used earlier
that we all understand that account

3
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:10,430
define is that a emergent
property that that has to emerge.

4
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:16,760
If you've got something that's intelligent
enough to replicate itself and Lavan

5
00:00:17,291 --> 00:00:20,370
drives, you said be the,
I don't know the answer,

6
00:00:20,371 --> 00:00:24,740
but it is worth considering
that this thing, this what we,

7
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:29,730
emotion meaning love and fear and all
those things are just the things that

8
00:00:29,731 --> 00:00:34,470
happen when you are intelligent.
Right? I don't know the answer to that,

9
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:39,650
but it could possibly be and does
consciousness have to have a local origin?

10
00:00:41,431 --> 00:00:43,470
Like it doesn't have to come from a thing.

11
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:48,840
Like if you think about cellular
communication, the, if you send me,

12
00:00:48,841 --> 00:00:52,560
if you're in England and you send me a
video from your phone and it reaches my

13
00:00:52,561 --> 00:00:55,770
phone,
it's getting to me through space.

14
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:57,720
It's going through the sky.

15
00:00:57,721 --> 00:01:02,310
It's like literally from a device not
connected by any wires or anything.

16
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,690
It's coming to me.
If,

17
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:09,730
if there's a possibility to create some
sort of global intelligence through

18
00:01:10,471 --> 00:01:15,210
electronics, that's nonlocal. If one
piece of it falls off this the same,

19
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:18,090
is it just repairs itself
or figures itself out?

20
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:23,270
But it's the same consciousness existing
on a global scale through some sort of

21
00:01:23,401 --> 00:01:26,970
an electronic network that instead
of the idea that you and I have,

22
00:01:26,971 --> 00:01:29,970
that Brian and Joe are,
you have your mind,

23
00:01:29,971 --> 00:01:33,810
I have my mind and we
exist as intelligent,

24
00:01:33,811 --> 00:01:36,840
being separate from each other,
but instead of that,

25
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:41,900
that all of it is connected and that all
of it is something that we can't even

26
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:47,370
conceive of because our brains are
too crude. Like trying to explain to,

27
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:51,640
you know, Australia pithy kiss
what a satellite is. Yeah, yeah,

28
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:57,210
yeah. I mean, I, yes, I mean if you
think of our brains, they are ultimately,

29
00:01:57,211 --> 00:02:01,320
what are they? They're just a distributed
network of cells connected by neurons.

30
00:02:01,321 --> 00:02:03,420
And I mean,
they're very complicated,

31
00:02:03,421 --> 00:02:07,710
but they are a colony of things that
are autonomous in a sense and the

32
00:02:07,711 --> 00:02:09,890
communicating with each
other. So, yeah, I don't,

33
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:13,350
I don't see why you can't scale
that up in principle. I mean,

34
00:02:13,351 --> 00:02:17,940
I should just add the caveat
is always that we don't know
about this. Yeah, it is.

35
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:20,100
It's just not understood.
Well,

36
00:02:20,101 --> 00:02:23,760
I think there's something
weird has physical though.
I'm damn sure it's physical.

37
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:29,090
I'm damn sure that there's nothing
going on in my head other than what is

38
00:02:29,281 --> 00:02:33,480
allowed by the laws of nature as we
understand them. So eliminating show,

39
00:02:33,481 --> 00:02:38,481
you mean the idea of a soul being some
sort of a divine thing that's inside the

40
00:02:38,551 --> 00:02:42,780
housing of the body? Yeah, I mean,
I, I would say we can rule that.

41
00:02:42,781 --> 00:02:46,170
I actually, I've argued in the
past, how do you rule it out?

42
00:02:46,171 --> 00:02:50,730
I've argued we can rule that out
in the following manner. So, so,

43
00:02:50,731 --> 00:02:54,640
so here's my arm, right? So it's made of
electrons and protons and neutrons. And,

44
00:02:54,641 --> 00:02:58,160
uh, if I, if I have a soul in there,
something that we don't understand,

45
00:02:58,161 --> 00:03:00,390
but it's a different kind
of energy or whatever it is

46
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:03,040
we don't have in physics at the moment,

47
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:08,440
it interacts with matter because I'm
moving my hand around. So whatever it is,

48
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:12,640
it's something that interacts
very strongly with matter.

49
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:16,570
But if you look at the history of
particle physics in particular,

50
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:19,180
which is the study of matter,
we spend,

51
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:23,650
we spent decades making high precision
measurements of how massive behaves and

52
00:03:23,651 --> 00:03:27,850
interacts and we look for, for
example, for a fifth force of nature.

53
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:30,580
So we know for forces the gravity,

54
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:34,030
the two nuclear forces called the
weak and strong nuclear forces and

55
00:03:34,031 --> 00:03:36,940
electromagnetism and
that's what we know exist.

56
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:41,140
And we look for another one with ultra
high precision and we don't see any

57
00:03:41,141 --> 00:03:41,974
evidence of it.

58
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:47,280
So I would claim that we know how
matter interacts at these energies.

59
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:50,930
So room temperature.
Now these Ngo,

60
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:55,810
we know how matter interacts
very precisely and so if
you want to suggest the

61
00:03:55,811 --> 00:03:58,870
something else that interacts
with matter strongly,

62
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:03,580
then I would say that it's ruled out.
I would go as far as say it's,

63
00:04:03,581 --> 00:04:08,500
he'd ruled out by experiment or at least
he sees extremely subtle and you would

64
00:04:08,501 --> 00:04:12,460
have to jump through a lot of hoops to
come up with a theory of some stuff that

65
00:04:12,461 --> 00:04:17,461
we wouldn't have seen when we've observed
how matter interacts that is present

66
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:21,370
in our bodies.
And presumably we believe in the soul.

67
00:04:21,371 --> 00:04:23,470
You want it to exist outside.
When you die,

68
00:04:23,471 --> 00:04:26,590
you still want the thing to be there and
you might believe in ghosts and things

69
00:04:26,591 --> 00:04:28,480
like that. We look at
ghosts. I mean it's, uh,

70
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,680
it is something that carries the imprint
of you. Presumably it looks like you,

71
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:37,480
right? So that means that it interacts
strongly with the matter that is you,

72
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:41,710
because it carries a pattern.
If it carries a pattern
that carries information,

73
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:43,150
if he carries information,

74
00:04:43,151 --> 00:04:46,090
there has to be an energy source that
allows the information to be assisting the

75
00:04:46,091 --> 00:04:48,950
pattern to persist and so on.
So again, you end up with a,

76
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:54,310
a theory that is postulating,
something interacts with light.

77
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:57,460
Because if you think a ghost is the soul,

78
00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:00,160
then it's something that
people see sometimes.

79
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:02,410
So that means interacts with light.

80
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:07,800
But we know how light interacts and we
ruled out anything but the most subtle,

81
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:13,810
uh, further interaction that we
haven't seen. So I would, I claim it,

82
00:05:13,811 --> 00:05:15,520
I started off as a joke. This, actually,

83
00:05:15,521 --> 00:05:18,190
I wrote it in an infinite monkey
cage book, this radio show that I do,

84
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:23,470
but he ended up, when I'd written it down,
I thought actually that it makes sense.

85
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:26,480
And I read some news similar actually,
I think, um, Sean Carroll, he,

86
00:05:26,481 --> 00:05:28,160
I don't know if you've had
Sean on the shareable times.

87
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:30,640
He's said something in the same,

88
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:32,530
I think in the book that
he wrote the big picture.

89
00:05:32,531 --> 00:05:36,190
I think he has a similar argument
actually. So it's occurred to him as well,

90
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:40,090
is roughly the same argument.
So if you,

91
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:46,080
so this energy that's interacting with
matter, even if you are not moving at all,

92
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:49,860
if you're just thinking it's interacting
with the matter that encompasses your

93
00:05:49,861 --> 00:05:53,430
mind or your brain or your
nerves or your neurons,

94
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:57,150
it's something in there that's
interacting with matter,

95
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:58,460
whether you like it or not.

96
00:05:58,461 --> 00:06:03,461
So even just a simple thought process
or a dream is still something it's

97
00:06:03,711 --> 00:06:07,390
interacting with Matt. Yeah. Well
obviously cause it, you know, you,

98
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:11,300
it's your will isn't it in that sense
when you move, it's presumably, right.

99
00:06:11,301 --> 00:06:13,620
So you can, even, if you're not
moving the idea, like the, you're,

100
00:06:13,621 --> 00:06:16,460
you're saying you're like your body's
interacted with matter as you're moving

101
00:06:16,461 --> 00:06:18,140
your arm.
But even if you're not moving,

102
00:06:18,141 --> 00:06:20,690
if you're just thinking and
you're completely still,

103
00:06:20,691 --> 00:06:23,180
which is not totally possible because
your heart's beating and your breathing

104
00:06:23,181 --> 00:06:23,990
and all that stuff.

105
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:28,760
But if somehow or another you were
able to isolate just the thought,

106
00:06:28,761 --> 00:06:32,240
the thoughts themselves are still
interacting with matter because they're

107
00:06:32,241 --> 00:06:35,990
interacting with the brain itself.
Yeah. So there's something in there.

108
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:38,630
There's something that interacts with
the physical structure of your body.

109
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:42,300
And, and, and I would
say there isn't that we,

110
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:44,850
so that's

111
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:50,090
the woo woo version is that
the brain itself and the body,

112
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:53,730
the physical. So this,
this, this spiritual self,

113
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:58,620
you are merely an antenna
that's tuning in to the, the,

114
00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:00,840
the great consciousness of the universe.

115
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:05,330
But why?
But then you have to answer what we know,

116
00:07:05,331 --> 00:07:09,880
what we're made of. So we know how those
particles behave and interact. Right. So,

117
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:13,090
so why did the particles not,
uh,

118
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:18,530
in any way interact with that
stuff? Because we interact.
We don't if that's true,

119
00:07:18,531 --> 00:07:22,910
we don't only just interact with it,
so we interact extremely strongly with it.

120
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:24,920
We're interacting with it now.

121
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:28,310
Every movement I make is the
interaction between that.

122
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:33,010
Every man's where you have,
yeah. Yes. What? Everything.
If I moved my fingers or I,

123
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:36,860
everything that I'm doing is an
interaction between that stuff in me.

124
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:39,620
So it's a very strong
interaction with matter,

125
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:44,180
but we don't see it in all our
precision measurement. Well,

126
00:07:44,181 --> 00:07:46,400
that's the answer for that.
The answer is because it's not there.

127
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:49,070
The answer's Jesus and a,
you can't measure God.

128
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:54,410
That may be an answer, but the point
is, as we talked about earlier,

129
00:07:54,411 --> 00:07:58,600
with absolute space, yeah, you
can't measure it. It's not there.

130
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:01,873
Right.

131
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:05,560
It's but for, for whatever
reason, for people,

132
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:10,590
there is some incredible motivation to
find a divine something or another that's

133
00:08:14,291 --> 00:08:19,210
there's something greater than this
physical being that there's something.

134
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:22,240
What do you think that is? Like
what is that compulsion? It we,

135
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:25,600
we've already talked a bit about it.
I think it goes to the,

136
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:30,290
the heart of this question
of what it means to be human.

137
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:35,180
So I would say that being human,

138
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:39,810
the answer right to the, I don't
know the answer to the meaning of it,

139
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:43,290
but the answer would be,
uh,

140
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:48,230
we are small finite beings,
right?

141
00:08:48,231 --> 00:08:52,100
Which are just clusters of atoms
as we said before, the very rare,

142
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,770
but we understand roughly how they,

143
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:58,770
how they came to be and we
have a limited amount of time,

144
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:03,150
not actually unfortunately,
but because of the laws of nature,

145
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:07,780
the laws of nature for bidders
to be immortal, that they, they,

146
00:09:07,781 --> 00:09:11,700
they in mortalities ruled
out by the laws of physics.

147
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:15,750
But also actually what
was interesting about,

148
00:09:15,751 --> 00:09:19,770
if you look at the basic physics of the
universe going from the big bangs where

149
00:09:19,771 --> 00:09:20,604
we are today,

150
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:26,120
then the physics is driven by the fact
that the universe began in an extremely

151
00:09:26,341 --> 00:09:31,341
old olded state because it was a very
highly ordered system and it is tending

152
00:09:32,191 --> 00:09:34,820
towards a more disordered
system or the moments.

153
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:36,720
And that's called the second
law of thermodynamics.

154
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:40,320
And it's that basic common sense
thing that things go to shit.

155
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:46,230
Basically it's the second law of
thermodynamics. What we strongly suspect,

156
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:48,790
and I would say no,
uh,

157
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:53,880
is that in that process of
going from order to disorder,

158
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:58,800
complexity emerges naturally
for a brief period of time.

159
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:04,080
So it's a natural part of the evolution
of the universe that you get appeared in

160
00:10:04,081 --> 00:10:06,090
time when there's
complexity in the universe.

161
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:10,560
So Stars and planets and galaxies
and life and civilizations,

162
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:14,820
but they are, they exist because
the universe is decaying,

163
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,490
not in spite of the fact that
the universe is decaying.

164
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:23,060
So our existence in that sort of
picture is necessarily finite,

165
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:25,350
the necessarily time limited.

166
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:30,900
And it is a remarkable thing that that
complexity has got so far that there are

167
00:10:30,901 --> 00:10:34,080
things in the universe that can
think and feel and explore it.

168
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:38,730
And I think that is the answer. If you
want an answer to the meaning of it all,

169
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:39,683
it's that,

170
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:44,490
that you are part of the universe because
of the way the laws of nature work.

171
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:49,460
You are allowed to exist, but you're
allowed to exist for a temporary of,

172
00:10:49,461 --> 00:10:52,860
for a small amount of time in it,
possibly infinite universe.
