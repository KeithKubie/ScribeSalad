1
00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.080
All right. Microchipping Oh God. Don't even get me started on this.

2
00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:07.900
I, I just cannot fucking, but like,

3
00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:12.460
I just can't fucking believe this shit.

4
00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:17.110
Do you know Delta Airlines wants to start using people's fingerprints?

5
00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.740
It's a way for you to get on the fucking plane and do you know that most people

6
00:00:22.741 --> 00:00:25.920
won't have a problem with it? They're so fucking stupid.

7
00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:29.340
It's like there's so many people out in the world. It's almost like,

8
00:00:29.341 --> 00:00:32.340
you know what too? Why don't you just become a fucking slave?

9
00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.830
Like how much you're going to give to these people.

10
00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.360
How underpaid are politicians that they will not stand up to these people,

11
00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:41.970
these corporations, I swear to God,

12
00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.720
they sitting there wasting all this fucking time with Isis and all this other

13
00:00:45.721 --> 00:00:48.090
bullshit, these fucking corporations, the,

14
00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:51.210
the shit that they're doing to their own goddamn country man,

15
00:00:51.211 --> 00:00:54.210
which they really don't have because they're fucking global.

16
00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:59.160
They don't give a shit about anything about just trying to make more fucking

17
00:00:59.161 --> 00:01:03.660
money and they want, they going to start microchip and people.

18
00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.900
It's Wisconsin, Wisconsin Company, two implant, Mike, Implant microchips, uh,

19
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.740
employees in like, like five people already agreed to it.

20
00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.040
They're going to take something foreign that's not natural to your body,

21
00:01:17.041 --> 00:01:19.320
and they're going to stick it underneath your fucking skin.

22
00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.370
They're going to know where you are at all fucking times and all these fucking

23
00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.370
dope player, you know, [inaudible] we keep the problem.

24
00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.730
Here's the fucking problem. Okay?

25
00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.820
Just because you're a fucking dope doesn't mean the rest of the world is okay.

26
00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:39.150
I think it's safe to say that me and everybody else listening to this thing,

27
00:01:39.151 --> 00:01:43.830
for the most part was not as smart. It's fucking George Washington. Right?

28
00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.710
Fair enough. Okay, well, here's the deal.

29
00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:50.040
If George Washington was microchipped and all his fucking buddies were

30
00:01:50.041 --> 00:01:50.760
microchipped,

31
00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:54.780
his fucking country wouldn't exist cause they would've known where he was.

32
00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.180
They would've gone over there and they would have fucking killed him.

33
00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.100
And that would have been the end of the fucking rebellion.

34
00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:00.550
So what you're doing is,

35
00:02:00.551 --> 00:02:04.290
is you're having faith that these fucking people at the top who have not even

36
00:02:04.291 --> 00:02:07.620
remotely demonstrated on any fucking level at any point in history,

37
00:02:07.621 --> 00:02:11.820
that they give a flying fuck about anybody other than themselves are going to,

38
00:02:11.821 --> 00:02:13.830
you're going to turn over that level of power.

39
00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.100
You're going to get fingerprinted by Delta fucking airlines,

40
00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.500
like you've committed some sort of a fucking crime.

41
00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.850
If fucking airline is going to have your fucking fingerprints,

42
00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.900
who in the fuck did they think they are? Do you know what? I went to buy my car.

43
00:02:27.901 --> 00:02:29.970
They asked for my thumbprint. I was like,

44
00:02:29.971 --> 00:02:34.440
I'm not getting my fucking fingerprints to your car dealership. They go, well,

45
00:02:34.441 --> 00:02:36.400
this is to protect you. No, it isn't yet douche.

46
00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.050
You're going to sell this to somebody. It's part of my profile.

47
00:02:40.051 --> 00:02:41.580
I think they just, they're collecting,

48
00:02:41.581 --> 00:02:45.090
they're all sharing information about you, what you buy, where you live,

49
00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:46.920
what your social security number is.

50
00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.800
You fucking fingerprints are going to get it all the way down to your fucking

51
00:02:49.801 --> 00:02:54.330
DNA. It's an it's, I dunno.

52
00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:56.340
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

53
00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:01.150
<v 0>And these politicians will not push back on any level because the president</v>

54
00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:02.620
makes 500 grand a year.

55
00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:07.300
That's the highest paid political office is 500 fucking grand a year and they

56
00:03:07.301 --> 00:03:10.960
need $100 million to get the job. I don't have 100 million.

57
00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:14.770
You don't have 100 million corporations do. And that's who they owe it to.

58
00:03:14.771 --> 00:03:17.650
So they just look the other fucking way. And what do they do?

59
00:03:17.651 --> 00:03:21.180
They sit there and they shit on fucking comedians constantly going after.

60
00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:22.930
Do you hear what he said about Caitlyn Jenner?

61
00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:26.590
And they look the other way with pharmaceutical companies handing out fucking

62
00:03:26.591 --> 00:03:27.101
opiates.

63
00:03:27.101 --> 00:03:30.880
Like they've given out flyers to some sort of jam band and now we've got this

64
00:03:30.881 --> 00:03:33.670
heroin fucking prom. They don't give a fuck. They don't say anything about it.

65
00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:38.230
Sorry, I know I'm fucking losing my shit here. But like,

66
00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:41.213
<v 1>okay,</v>

67
00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:45.510
<v 0>what they've done to the food supply, what the fuck they they,</v>

68
00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:48.800
the what the bankers have done left all these people upside down in their own

69
00:03:48.801 --> 00:03:51.470
fucking houses. What they've done to the water supply,

70
00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:55.910
fracking causing earthquakes in parts of the world that never had fucking

71
00:03:55.911 --> 00:03:58.370
earthquakes. Fucking up the drinking water.

72
00:03:59.710 --> 00:03:59.890
<v 1>Okay.</v>

73
00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:00.280
<v 0>You know,</v>

74
00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:03.580
they've got to send a fucking pipeline under the fucking native Americans land.

75
00:04:03.581 --> 00:04:06.910
I mean, like, like we haven't done enough to those fucking people,

76
00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:11.270
you know? Do you hear any politicians talking about that now?

77
00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:13.740
Nobody talks about that shit, but God for fucking bid,

78
00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:17.430
you do a fucking joke in a strip mall and it fucking all over it.

79
00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:20.510
Then that becomes like some big goddamn story. Um,

80
00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:23.970
this is fucking horrific and it makes me happy that I'm 49 years of age.

81
00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:28.920
The fact that I think I'm going to maybe get to live half a fucking century

82
00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:32.850
without a fucking airline having my fingerprints and me walking around with the

83
00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:35.910
goddamn microchip. You know, I love that.

84
00:04:35.911 --> 00:04:40.020
I lived 50 years before the fucking oh Jesus. She's up. Huh.

85
00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:45.750
Um, I love that. And that got to live 50 years before robots showed up.

86
00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:50.560
Um, it's just,

87
00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:55.070
it's just greed and power completely.

88
00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:58.010
100% out of control.

89
00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:02.450
And I hate like this is, I'm reading this,

90
00:05:02.451 --> 00:05:04.550
this is eye witness ABC News.

91
00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:09.670
So these guys are all bought and paid for CNN bought and paid for Fox News is

92
00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:10.341
bought and paypal,

93
00:05:10.341 --> 00:05:13.910
they're all fucking bought and paid for because the same people I just brought

94
00:05:13.911 --> 00:05:14.630
brought up,

95
00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:18.770
they advertise on their fucking networks so they have to watch what they say

96
00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:22.810
because they don't want to lose the ad money cause that's how they get paid,

97
00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:27.370
right. So they always have like the, oh Geez, this is a little unsettling.

98
00:05:27.371 --> 00:05:30.750
You know when they always come back from it, when they show some fucking robot,

99
00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:33.870
you've ever seen that? You watched it? The local news or what?

100
00:05:33.871 --> 00:05:36.970
They show somebody getting microchip and they always come back to the anchors

101
00:05:36.971 --> 00:05:39.190
and they kind of do that. Ooh, that's kind of a,

102
00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:42.670
and then they just move on to the next thing.

103
00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:45.880
But some fucking old lady who makes her own jam,

104
00:05:45.881 --> 00:05:48.880
like that's supposed to make you feel better at the end of the fucking newscast

105
00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:53.800
or some puppy that they thought was lost and fucking sniffed its way back to the

106
00:05:53.801 --> 00:05:56.200
station wagon. Three towns away, right?

107
00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:57.640
Whenever the fuck leave you on [inaudible]

108
00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:00.093
<v 1>um,</v>

109
00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:04.920
<v 0>now corporations are completely out of control.</v>

110
00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:08.160
They've been out of control my entire life and now it's,

111
00:06:08.161 --> 00:06:12.540
it's reaching a level that it's like you're watching a bad scifi movie.

112
00:06:12.541 --> 00:06:15.680
I think it's fucking insane. Why?

113
00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:19.610
Why the fuck do you need my fingerprints as a fucking airline?

114
00:06:19.611 --> 00:06:23.480
Who the fuck are you? You're not the FBI. You're not the government.

115
00:06:23.481 --> 00:06:24.710
You're a fucking airline.

116
00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:30.480
Your fingerprints, and this is the thing people will do.

117
00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:34.770
People will fucking do all of this so they don't have to stand in a line

118
00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:38.480
bill. Let them scan their fucking retina.

119
00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:45.700
They'll give him a fucking baby just so they can be pre-checked that's all you

120
00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:46.190
got to do.

121
00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:49.780
You just hold a little cookie out and the average fucking mouth breathe in

122
00:06:49.781 --> 00:06:52.900
fucking Maura. But you know something, I got to swear to God. I mean,

123
00:06:52.901 --> 00:06:53.980
this is really cynical, but I,

124
00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:56.860
you walk around and I finally got half the fucking people should be

125
00:06:56.861 --> 00:06:59.950
microchipped. You should know where these fucking idiots are.

126
00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:02.930
<v 1>Okay?</v>

127
00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:03.370
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

128
00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:08.370
I'll never forget that guy gallop in sideways on that Trump rally screaming at

129
00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:13.930
all these stupid liberals going, fuck political correctness. Build the wall.

130
00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:17.080
Build the wall is he's fucking galloping. Like, like,

131
00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:19.150
that was gonna make his life better.

132
00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:23.990
Like that was what was holding him back. I swear to God,

133
00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:26.223
<v 1>like,</v>

134
00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:31.780
<v 0>I don't give a fuck how dumb you are. You have to know as a white dude,</v>

135
00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:34.480
if you were born in the United States of America, okay,

136
00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:39.460
you're not going to get a better starting block than that.

137
00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:44.710
All right? And if you can't figure out some sort of gay, I mean,

138
00:07:44.711 --> 00:07:47.680
if you're going to fucking blame anybody, why are you going to look down?

139
00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:51.040
You've got to go up. That's what's fucking you over.

140
00:07:53.230 --> 00:07:56.650
Democrats and Republicans fucking you over.

141
00:07:56.920 --> 00:08:01.810
I just don't get how people don't see that. Um, but I'm like, most people,

142
00:08:01.811 --> 00:08:04.570
I feel like my ideas are right and no one else has a good point.

143
00:08:08.490 --> 00:08:09.323
<v 1>Um,</v>

144
00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:13.210
<v 0>unreal, this fucking car dealership. Can we get your thumbprint? It's like,</v>

145
00:08:13.211 --> 00:08:15.010
yeah, no, you guys sell cars.

146
00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:19.390
Do you understand that you guys lie for a living?

147
00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:24.490
Other salesman who lie for a living turn the other way.

148
00:08:24.590 --> 00:08:27.540
You let you turn the other way. When they see a car salesman, you like the head,

149
00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:31.760
you like the bottom of the barrel fucking salesman.

150
00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:33.140
I'm going to give you my fingerprint.

151
00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:36.090
You know why they said they wanted my fingerprint?

152
00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:38.620
They go just in case somebody comes in and tries to

153
00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:43.810
is an impostor and pretends that they're you and tries to buy a car.

154
00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:46.600
And I just looked at the guy and I was like, you know what?

155
00:08:46.601 --> 00:08:48.190
I'm going to take my chances on that.

156
00:08:55.010 --> 00:08:56.100
The guy literally goes

157
00:08:56.310 --> 00:08:58.080
<v 1>in, this is what killed me. He goes,</v>

158
00:08:58.140 --> 00:09:02.640
you're the first person we've ever have say no to that.

159
00:09:03.390 --> 00:09:05.460
Now I hope he's just being a car salesman.

160
00:09:05.461 --> 00:09:09.060
And he was lying to me and that was his last ditch effort to try to convince me.

161
00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:11.833
Um,

162
00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:17.060
<v 0>but uh, the other part is actually telling the truth. It's just like,</v>

163
00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:19.520
then what happens is what, what,

164
00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:24.140
this is how they do it is most people are adults.

165
00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:25.340
So they don't think,

166
00:09:25.610 --> 00:09:28.820
and then what happens is it becomes a herd mentality and all they gotta do is

167
00:09:28.821 --> 00:09:32.290
get most of the herd to start running over the fucking cliff. And you,

168
00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:34.640
you have to do it too. Cause if you don't,

169
00:09:34.670 --> 00:09:38.900
then you're just gonna be fucking sitting there all by yourself. Like, Hey,

170
00:09:38.901 --> 00:09:41.300
I'm not gonna have a cell phone. Hey, I'm not going to have this.

171
00:09:41.301 --> 00:09:44.030
I'm not going to have that. And then your life,

172
00:09:44.031 --> 00:09:46.490
the way you're going to lead it becomes extremely limited.

173
00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:47.750
And next thing you know,

174
00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:52.100
you're fucking half naked walking around your backyard trying to like trap

175
00:09:52.630 --> 00:09:52.631
squirrels,

176
00:09:52.631 --> 00:09:56.750
seek and eat that day because you're not doing what everybody else is doing.

177
00:09:57.650 --> 00:09:58.483
<v 1>Um,</v>

178
00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:04.200
<v 0>it's just, you know, it's going to be the worst is when they try to convince,</v>

179
00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:06.753
<v 1>uh,</v>

180
00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:09.800
<v 0>when they tried to convince people to do it right.</v>

181
00:10:10.050 --> 00:10:13.530
There's going to be some politician getting it with that fucking smile on his

182
00:10:13.531 --> 00:10:16.560
face, where he's like, I don't want to do this, but I have to do this.

183
00:10:17.130 --> 00:10:21.690
I have to do this so I can go on the post president fucking,

184
00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:23.310
you know,

185
00:10:23.310 --> 00:10:28.230
$70 million speaking tour where I go out and I give speeches to the same fucking

186
00:10:28.231 --> 00:10:32.730
people that put me into office, like the hero of all hero presidents.

187
00:10:32.731 --> 00:10:34.320
Obama is about to do. He just,

188
00:10:34.321 --> 00:10:39.321
he has that motherfucker has $69 million with the gigs on the books coming up.

189
00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:46.740
You know, I will never, for the life of me understand why that guy,

190
00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:48.150
people look like liberals.

191
00:10:48.151 --> 00:10:51.720
Look at that guy like he fucking did something for him. I will never get that.

192
00:10:51.721 --> 00:10:55.410
It's like that guy had his face in the pig trough just like everybody else.

193
00:10:56.930 --> 00:10:58.350
I mean, I don't know. I don't know what it is.

194
00:10:59.130 --> 00:11:02.430
I think it's because he's sandwiched between two of the worst public speakers of

195
00:11:02.431 --> 00:11:05.760
all time, Bush and fucking Trump. You know what I mean?

196
00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:09.080
I think if he came after Clinton where Clinton wasn't the greatest, Whoa, whoa,

197
00:11:09.410 --> 00:11:12.540
whoa, Whoa, whoa. But he got enough. The women fucking loved them.

198
00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:17.490
I will never get that either. How much women love that fucking big fucking baby?

199
00:11:17.650 --> 00:11:20.990
He, we look at goofball. Um, Jesus Bell.

200
00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:23.730
There are any presidents that you liked? Yeah, I lied in mind.

201
00:11:23.731 --> 00:11:28.620
The first George Bush fucking war hero and I liked, uh,

202
00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:29.820
I liked Jimmy Carter.
