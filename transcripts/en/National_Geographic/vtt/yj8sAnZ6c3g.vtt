00:00:00.633 --> 00:00:10.767
[music playing]

00:00:10.767 --> 00:00:12.767
[glass hitting metal]

00:00:12.767 --> 00:00:23.300
[light scraping sound]

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:24.433
[violin playing]

00:00:24.433 --> 00:00:28.100
[LIGHT CRASH OF GLASS INTO
METAL]

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.100
[footsteps]

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:51.667
[side conversation]

00:00:51.667 --> 00:00:52.400
ALBERT: Miss Maric.

00:00:55.367 --> 00:00:57.133
MILEVA: Are you under
the impression you're

00:00:57.133 --> 00:00:58.300
the only one in the building?

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.266
ALBERT: Sorry,
did I disturb you?

00:01:00.266 --> 00:01:03.800
MILEVA: Your
playing is adequate,

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.633
but it makes it quite
difficult to concentrate.

00:01:07.633 --> 00:01:09.000
ALBERT: Apologies.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.667
Mozart helps me think.

00:01:11.667 --> 00:01:13.000
MILEVA: I'm not
sure this assignment

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.367
requires much thought.

00:01:14.367 --> 00:01:16.166
ALBERT: Well, not
if we were to follow

00:01:16.166 --> 00:01:19.333
these inelegant instructions.

00:01:19.333 --> 00:01:21.333
There must be a better
approach, don't you think?

00:01:21.333 --> 00:01:23.100
MILEVA: I think following
the instructions

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.467
is the way to pass the class.

00:01:24.467 --> 00:01:26.266
ALBERT: Is that all you
want from an education,

00:01:26.266 --> 00:01:27.500
to pass your exams?

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:28.834
MILEVA: I want a
degree, don't you?

00:01:28.834 --> 00:01:31.133
ALBERT: Certainly, but
I'm a student of science

00:01:31.133 --> 00:01:34.467
because, well, I
want to discover

00:01:34.467 --> 00:01:38.400
new ways of understanding
the world around me.

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.967
Don't you already know
how this will turn out?

00:01:41.967 --> 00:01:45.433
MILEVA: I find knowing how
it will turn out reassuring.

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:53.633
Discover quietly, Herr Einstein.

00:01:53.633 --> 00:01:54.367
Please.

00:02:13.533 --> 00:02:15.533
[winding noise]

00:02:22.533 --> 00:02:29.100
[hiss]

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:30.633
[explosion]
ALBERT: Oh.

00:02:30.633 --> 00:02:31.533
Ow.

00:02:31.533 --> 00:02:32.467
Ah.
