00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:03.710
NARRATOR: In 1982, 40 women
became

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:07.540
the first female firefighters
in New York City history.

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:12.210
But it didn't happen without
a fight led by one woman.

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.830
When I was growing
up in the 1950s,

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:18.880
I did not think it was
possible for girls and women

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:20.710
to become firefighters.

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:24.750
Little girls were not expected
to grow up to be anything

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.670
other than wives and mommies.

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.080
You could be a teacher.

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.250
You could be a nurse.

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:32.250
You could be a secretary.

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:33.880
That didn't appeal to me at all.

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:36.710
I want to do things
that little boys

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:38.380
could do when they grew up.

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:41.830
But, you know, best-laid plans.

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:45.040
NARRATOR: After studying history
in college and graduate school,

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.710
Berkman attended
law school at NYU.

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:49.880
While I was in law school,
a couple of things happened.

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:53.080
One was I learned that
it's really hard to use

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:55.040
the law for social justice.

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:59.250
Then also I really started to
question the idea that I was

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.250
going to be in an
occupation where I

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:04.120
sat behind a desk all day long.

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:07.420
Then I met some New
York City fire officers,

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:11.790
and that's when I discovered how
great the job of firefighting

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.210
was.

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:15.710
So I thought, I think
I'll give it a shot.

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.250
I also didn't realize that the
New York City Fire Department

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.120
had never accepted
an application

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:26.580
from a woman for the entry
exam for firefighting.

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.120
That changed in 1977.

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:32.290
For the first time, women
were allowed to apply,

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:33.460
and I applied.

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:34.960
You had to pass two tests.

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.620
One was a written test,
which was multiple choice,

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:41.790
and you had to pass a physical
abilities test, which consisted

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.000
of a whole number of events.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.790
NARRATOR: Events like climbing
over an eight-foot wall

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.460
and carrying a 120-pound
duffel bag over a shoulder

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.830
up three flights of stairs
and back down again.

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:57.830
The physical portion
of the firefighter exam

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:59.830
wasn't just unfair.

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:03.920
It was illegal because it
didn't test for the abilities

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.790
actually needed to
be trained to perform

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:08.460
the job of firefighting.

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:13.830
And so I went I talked to
Laura Sager at NYU Law School,

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.500
and I explained
what had happened.

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.960
I said, I don't think
this test is job related.

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:21.830
NARRATOR: So Berkman, Laura
Sager, and Congresswoman Bella

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:23.830
Abzug went to the
head of personnel

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:26.210
at the New York City
Fire Department.

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:30.210
And we say to them, just
develop a job-related test.

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:32.540
And basically the
head of personnel

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.330
said to us he wasn't
going to change the test,

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:38.830
and if I didn't like it,
he'd see me in court.

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:41.790
So I sued.

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:46.540
NARRATOR: The lawsuit went on
for years until finally in 1982

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:48.620
Brenda, along with
40 other women,

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.330
were allowed into
the training academy.

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:55.460
But because of the animosity
towards the women, instructors

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:59.540
who had a personal
vendetta against women

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:02.210
being firefighters were
allowed pretty much

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:04.790
free reign to do whatever they
want to try and make the women

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:06.040
quit.

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.670
They gave us carbon
monoxide poisoning

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:12.920
and, you know, tools
were dropped on us.

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:17.420
They had not prepared
us with gear that fit.

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.670
So women with smaller
feet were having

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:21.710
their boots fall off
as they were attempting

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:23.420
to climb the aerial ladder.

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:25.080
We didn't have gloves that fit.

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:28.000
That meant that it was
really hard to hold on

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.830
to tools and hose lines
and other kinds of things

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:32.580
that we needed to do.

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:37.000
And was amazing to me was that
very few of that original group

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.170
of women quit.

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:41.170
They just hung in there.

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:45.880
And they were being harassed
not only by the instructors

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:49.080
but by their fellow
trainees, the guys.

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:51.460
NARRATOR: The women who
graduated from the fire academy

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:53.120
were assigned to firehouses.

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:57.250
New York finally had its first
group of women firefighters.

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:59.710
But despite overcoming
great challenges,

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:02.460
women still faced adversity
and discrimination

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:04.120
in the firehouse.

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:09.290
There was a lot of overt
hostility and even dangerous

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:12.920
threatening actions
to women firefighters.

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:14.580
Draining of the air tanks--

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:17.250
so when you went into the fire
you'd turn on your air tank,

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:18.460
and all of a sudden
you'd discover

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:19.960
that there was no air in it.

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:23.420
Women were threatened with
being pushed off a roof.

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:25.250
They were sexually assaulted.

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:27.460
They were beat up
at a company picnic.

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:29.380
We did speak out.

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:32.620
We learned that, you know,
the judge can't be with us

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:35.830
in the firehouse
for 24 hours a day,

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:40.170
that the problems of integrating
women into the department

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:42.500
are not going to
disappear overnight,

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:45.620
but things have
definitely gotten better.

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:49.330
I think it's so important
that younger women know

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:54.120
this history, that they
realize that the opportunities

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.750
that they have today
didn't just sort

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:59.170
of, like, get handed to them.

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:02.670
We only came through
all those bad times

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:06.290
because good people
refused to be silent,

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:07.960
and they took action.

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:12.420
We can do this, but
we have to work.

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:15.710
We can't leave it to
other people to do.

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:18.710
We have to stand up
and do it ourselves.
