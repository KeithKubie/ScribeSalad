00:00:15.636 --> 00:00:18.246
&gt;&gt;Narrator: It's October in
central Washington's wheat belt,

00:00:18.246 --> 00:00:22.176
and in the township of Waterville,
everyone's on the lookout

00:00:22.236 --> 00:00:25.746
for a tiny critter called
Phrynosoma Douglasii,

00:00:26.596 --> 00:00:28.886
better known as the
horny toad lizard.

00:00:29.096 --> 00:00:32.966
&gt;&gt;Man: Now when I was thirteen years
old, I drove a team of six horses

00:00:32.966 --> 00:00:35.816
on a rod wheater, and I
saw lots of 'em there.

00:00:35.816 --> 00:00:38.036
And they're nice little animals.

00:00:38.036 --> 00:00:41.746
They eat bugs and they
do a lotta nice things.

00:00:41.746 --> 00:00:46.336
&gt;&gt;Girl: We'd go into the dried
creek bed and wed flip over rocks

00:00:46.556 --> 00:00:51.656
and my mom and I, we found
ten, right just along here.

00:00:51.826 --> 00:00:52.896
&gt;&gt;I've got twenty-nine.

00:00:52.896 --> 00:00:55.176
&gt;&gt;Man: Actually see more on the
roads than out in the field.

00:00:55.916 --> 00:00:57.856
And you stop and then
you try to go out

00:00:57.856 --> 00:00:59.336
and find them, and
sometimes it's hard.

00:00:59.336 --> 00:01:02.456
And if you're in a snaky area, you
don't want to follow them too close.

00:01:02.776 --> 00:01:05.636
&gt;&gt;I've found the horny
toads all under here.

00:01:06.236 --> 00:01:06.816
&gt;&gt;Dig in it.

00:01:08.316 --> 00:01:09.806
&gt;&gt;Narrator: For the past six years,

00:01:09.806 --> 00:01:11.766
the lizard project has
been a key component

00:01:11.766 --> 00:01:14.726
of the fourth grade
curriculum at Waterville School.

00:01:15.966 --> 00:01:19.686
Local farmers volunteer their
time to record critter sightings

00:01:19.776 --> 00:01:22.186
on data sheets provided
by the students.

00:01:22.226 --> 00:01:24.286
&gt;&gt;I'd like to welcome
everybody this morning.

00:01:24.426 --> 00:01:25.786
&gt;&gt;Narrator: On the first
day of the project,

00:01:26.056 --> 00:01:28.266
the farmers bring their
information to school.

00:01:28.726 --> 00:01:33.156
They meet their student partners,
and help them enter data on graphs

00:01:33.156 --> 00:01:35.286
and charts which pinpoint the time.

00:01:35.406 --> 00:01:37.216
&gt;&gt;It was just one, at three PM.

00:01:37.516 --> 00:01:37.956
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Place.

00:01:38.186 --> 00:01:39.696
&gt;&gt;That's too far over.

00:01:39.696 --> 00:01:41.156
&gt;&gt;Narrator: And temperature
for each sighting.

00:01:41.156 --> 00:01:43.536
&gt;&gt;Farmer: So then where
else do we go from here?

00:01:43.536 --> 00:01:45.276
Do we have to log these
in on the computer?

00:01:45.276 --> 00:01:46.376
&gt;&gt;Yeah Okay.

00:01:46.376 --> 00:01:49.816
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The lizard data is
used by research Karen Dvornich,

00:01:50.006 --> 00:01:53.706
as part of a University of Washington
program called NatureMapping,

00:01:54.006 --> 00:01:58.976
an effort to quantify populations of
common species across the country.

00:01:59.426 --> 00:02:01.406
&gt;&gt;Karen: The NatureMapping
program is really simple:

00:02:01.406 --> 00:02:02.946
tell us what you see
and where you see it.

00:02:03.446 --> 00:02:05.766
And all the schools, and all the
different communities provide

00:02:05.766 --> 00:02:06.646
that information to us.

00:02:07.586 --> 00:02:10.286
&gt;&gt;So this is all new science
for us, and it's just wonderful.

00:02:10.596 --> 00:02:12.436
And we don't know what
the horny toads do.

00:02:12.666 --> 00:02:14.396
We don't understand how
they live in the farmland.

00:02:14.676 --> 00:02:17.416
We don't understand what
they do during the winter.

00:02:17.886 --> 00:02:19.376
We don't know if they freeze.

00:02:20.106 --> 00:02:22.766
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Working with fourth
grade teacher, Diane Peterson,

00:02:23.056 --> 00:02:26.046
Dvornich helped design
core curriculum materials

00:02:26.106 --> 00:02:27.376
around the yearlong project.

00:02:28.086 --> 00:02:31.546
&gt;&gt;Diane: So we have to be reading
and writing and doing math--

00:02:31.546 --> 00:02:34.076
&gt;&gt;Karen: When I saw what
the kids were supposed to do

00:02:34.076 --> 00:02:38.076
at different age levels, I said,
"Oh, we have math, we have science,

00:02:38.076 --> 00:02:40.946
we have technology, we have art.

00:02:41.626 --> 00:02:42.876
We have all these components."

00:02:43.156 --> 00:02:48.636
&gt;&gt;Student: How to catch a horny toad.

00:02:48.796 --> 00:02:51.606
The first thing you have
to have is a good eye.

00:02:51.746 --> 00:02:53.586
&gt;&gt;Diane: When we do
project based learning,

00:02:53.746 --> 00:02:55.826
every learning style can be hit.

00:02:55.826 --> 00:03:00.506
The kids can use their own
personal best learning style

00:03:00.946 --> 00:03:02.006
to accomplish the goals.

00:03:02.576 --> 00:03:04.236
&gt;&gt;Farmer: That's a good
picture, that looks just

00:03:04.236 --> 00:03:05.866
like the ones I've seen, actually.

00:03:06.486 --> 00:03:08.526
&gt;&gt;Diane: We've found
that for some kids,

00:03:08.736 --> 00:03:11.526
drawing a scientific
illustration that's labeled

00:03:11.526 --> 00:03:15.756
with all the correct scientific words
is a perfect way for them to shine

00:03:15.756 --> 00:03:16.776
and to show what they know.

00:03:17.036 --> 00:03:20.796
&gt;&gt;Student: The tail is right
there, it has stripes on it.

00:03:20.796 --> 00:03:22.146
&gt;&gt;Narrator: During the project,

00:03:22.146 --> 00:03:26.266
students learn sophisticated
computer programs like ArtView,

00:03:26.266 --> 00:03:30.956
and they display their findings on a
class webpage at the end of the year.

00:03:31.096 --> 00:03:33.026
&gt;&gt;Farmer: Okay, it's
twenty-six, twenty-three.

00:03:33.026 --> 00:03:33.976
What maps do I need?

00:03:34.056 --> 00:03:37.586
&gt;&gt;Diane: We start very simply with
some paper maps and we learn how

00:03:37.586 --> 00:03:39.396
to find township range and section.

00:03:39.636 --> 00:03:42.556
And now what does this
look like on the computer?

00:03:42.556 --> 00:03:45.476
&gt;&gt;Farmer: Let's zoom into
this area right here.

00:03:45.476 --> 00:03:48.046
&gt;&gt;Diane: And we practice,
and everybody has a turn.

00:03:48.046 --> 00:03:52.516
It's a long process, and
there's a high learning curve.

00:03:53.126 --> 00:03:55.986
The technology's easier for
the kids than it is for me.

00:03:55.986 --> 00:03:58.696
&gt;&gt;Student: We need to
find T twenty-eight.

00:03:58.876 --> 00:04:01.446
&gt;&gt;Diane: Involving
the farmers who may

00:04:01.446 --> 00:04:04.516
or may not have had the
best experience in school,

00:04:04.966 --> 00:04:08.246
getting them back into school
for a really positive experience,

00:04:08.406 --> 00:04:13.226
they're just amazed at what the kids
know, and relationships are formed

00:04:13.296 --> 00:04:17.806
between these kids and the farmers,
that go way beyond this project.

00:04:18.136 --> 00:04:20.796
&gt;&gt;Mark: I don't like to call
these young people kids,

00:04:20.796 --> 00:04:22.236
because kids are young goats.

00:04:22.236 --> 00:04:23.776
These are young adults.

00:04:24.716 --> 00:04:26.406
They've got a tremendous teacher.

00:04:26.456 --> 00:04:28.516
&gt;&gt;Karen: So you want to
put your GPSs up this way.

00:04:28.966 --> 00:04:32.246
Those six numbers, those
numbers you see there,

00:04:32.246 --> 00:04:33.916
are satellites, circling the earth.

00:04:34.566 --> 00:04:35.396
&gt;&gt;Wow!

00:04:35.776 --> 00:04:38.986
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Later in the day,
students travel to a nearby field

00:04:38.986 --> 00:04:41.336
to learn new techniques
in lizard tracking,

00:04:41.676 --> 00:04:44.816
with the latest ground
positioning satellite technology.

00:04:45.026 --> 00:04:47.506
&gt;&gt;Karen: They feel very comfortable
with any of the technology nowadays.

00:04:47.776 --> 00:04:49.786
They follow their instructions
very well,

00:04:50.066 --> 00:04:51.266
because they're serious about it.

00:04:51.386 --> 00:04:52.706
&gt;&gt;You see that word "position?"

00:04:53.106 --> 00:04:56.096
Tap on the position
and look for status.

00:04:56.546 --> 00:04:58.076
&gt;&gt;It's not a field trip;
when we go out there,

00:04:58.076 --> 00:05:01.206
the kids know that we're doing real
science and they're much more alert.

00:05:01.206 --> 00:05:04.576
If it was just a field trip,
they wouldn't be there,

00:05:04.576 --> 00:05:06.266
'cause what does it really mean?

00:05:06.266 --> 00:05:09.886
&gt;&gt;So if we know where horny toads
are, we want you to go to that site

00:05:09.886 --> 00:05:13.376
and we want you to write down that
latitude and longitude on your paper.

00:05:13.956 --> 00:05:16.916
&gt;&gt;I've seen a huge difference
when the kids realize

00:05:16.916 --> 00:05:18.766
that they are junior scientists.

00:05:18.766 --> 00:05:20.146
I treat them as junior scientists.

00:05:20.146 --> 00:05:21.606
I speak to them as junior scientists.

00:05:21.696 --> 00:05:24.586
I don't simplify anything, I define
everything that I'm telling them

00:05:24.586 --> 00:05:27.696
so they can use the same terms when
they wanna talk to another scientist.

00:05:27.916 --> 00:05:29.956
&gt;&gt;Narrator: After receiving
their initial instructions,

00:05:30.136 --> 00:05:32.826
the young scientists
took off at a gallop,

00:05:33.286 --> 00:05:35.966
each hoping to be the
first to spot a lizard.

00:05:35.966 --> 00:05:39.656
&gt;&gt;And watch if there's some
in there [inaudible] We're not

00:05:40.046 --> 00:05:40.546
finding anything.

00:05:40.546 --> 00:05:45.006
&gt;&gt;Narrator: But after
combing the area,

00:05:45.426 --> 00:05:49.446
the only toad they found was the one
provided by researcher Megan Lahti.

00:05:49.646 --> 00:05:50.546
&gt;&gt;See, there she is.

00:05:51.136 --> 00:05:53.566
&gt;&gt;Narrator: She had attached a
radio collar to a toad's back

00:05:53.756 --> 00:05:56.546
to demonstrate another
way of tracking.

00:05:56.696 --> 00:05:58.466
&gt;&gt;Megan: And turn it on
and turn it loud enough

00:05:58.466 --> 00:05:59.876
so that everybody can hear the beeps.

00:06:00.216 --> 00:06:04.176
&gt;&gt;I think that this is far more
beneficial than a lot of the science

00:06:04.176 --> 00:06:08.616
that I had done in my elementary
years, and I think the fact

00:06:08.616 --> 00:06:10.496
that getting the kids
out into the field

00:06:10.746 --> 00:06:15.296
and helping them understand science
as real professional scientists do,

00:06:15.296 --> 00:06:19.416
using GPS and other technologies,
is very beneficial to them.

00:06:20.166 --> 00:06:21.846
&gt;&gt;Do you see her?

00:06:21.896 --> 00:06:21.976
&gt;&gt;All: Yeah.

00:06:23.136 --> 00:06:24.466
&gt;&gt;Jessie: The first time that I found

00:06:24.466 --> 00:06:27.636
out I was gonna be doing horny
toad work, I was really excited,

00:06:27.876 --> 00:06:29.716
and it's really exciting today,

00:06:29.786 --> 00:06:31.966
because I've been working
hard on these projects.

00:06:32.026 --> 00:06:38.346
I was hoping to be a marine biologist
and a scientist, working with lizards

00:06:38.476 --> 00:06:42.356
and stuff, so this is really fun
for me, and it gives me a heads

00:06:42.356 --> 00:06:46.816
up on what I'm gonna do in the
future, maybe, if I make it, yeah.

00:06:47.436 --> 00:06:50.706
And so that's pretty
much what I'm gonna do.

00:06:51.936 --> 00:06:52.906
&gt;&gt;Oh, right here, right here.

00:06:53.396 --> 00:06:55.806
&gt;&gt;Diane: I like to see kids
excited about learning.

00:06:56.436 --> 00:06:57.116
&gt;&gt;Oh, sweet.

00:06:57.506 --> 00:06:58.766
&gt;&gt;Diane: And that's what I see

00:06:58.826 --> 00:07:00.956
when they're working
on a project like this.

00:07:05.026 --> 00:07:07.006
