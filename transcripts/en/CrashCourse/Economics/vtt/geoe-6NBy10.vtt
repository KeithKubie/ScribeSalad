00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:04.920
Hi I'm Adriene Hill and I'm Jacob Clifford
and welcome to Crash Course Economics.

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:10.280
Today we're going to talk about international
trade. So we all know our stuff is from everywhere.

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:13.660
Bangladesh, China, Vietnam, China again,

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:17.720
but what does it actually tell us about the global
economy or the US economy?

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:20.840
And who's is benefitting from all this trade.
And who's gonna clean all this up?

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:29.540
[Theme Music]

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:33.700
International trade is the lifeblood of
the global economy. Basically when a good

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:37.050
or service is produed in, let's say, Brazil
and sold to a person or business in the

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.760
US, that counts as an export for Brazil
and as an import from US. As you might

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.510
expect, the United States is the world's
largest importer because Americans love

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.030
their stuff. In 2014 Americans import
over two trillion dollars worth of stuff,

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:53.629
like oil cars and clothing from
countries all over the world. And if you

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:57.530
look around your local big box store, it
feels like everything is made in China.

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.520
And we do import a lot of things from
China but in terms of both imports, and

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:06.430
exports our largest trading partner's not
China, it's Canada. The US and Canada trade

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:09.149
over six hundred billion dollars worth
of goods and services each year.

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:13.869
The US imports a lot from Canada but exports
almost as much. In fact, the United States is

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:16.910
the world's second-largest exporter. It
sells high-tech things like

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:21.009
pharmaceuticals, jet turbines, generators
and aircraft to countries all over the world.

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:24.979
It also exports intellectual goods like
Kanye West albums and Pixar movies as

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:28.470
well as bulk commodities like corn, oil
and cotton. The annual difference between

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.819
a country's exports and imports is
called net exports. So if Brazil exports 250

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:38.119
billion dollars worth of goods and
imports 200 billion that its net exports

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:43.550
are fifty billion. That means Brazil has
a trade surplus. In 2014, net exports in

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:48.160
the usmore negative 722 billion dollars. That's what you call a trade deficit.

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:52.810
Some people assume that having a trade
deficit is inherently bad. Why does the

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:56.420
US import nearly all of clothing? Why can't we clote ourselves?

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.460
US producers could easily make more
than enough clothing to keep all of us

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:04.649
dressed. But they don't because they focus
on other things that they're better at

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:08.450
producing. The US buys clothes from other
countries because we can get them

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:13.140
cheaper than if we made them here. This
is the value of international trade. It

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.870
doesn't make sense to make everything on
your own if you can trade with other

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.950
countries that have a comparative
advantage. It's worth mentioning here

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.440
that these savings sometimes come with
other costs, especially for the people

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:30.790
who are producing these goods overseas.
Unsafe and unfair working conditions, and

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:34.640
environmental degradation can be ugly
side effects of

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:39.040
internnational trade. And we're gonna talk about
that. For today though let's get a handle

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.300
on trade deficits. It can seem like
exporting would make a country wealthy

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:47.650
while importing would make it poor. After
all, if we buy products produced in other

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:52.540
countries than were shipping jobs
overseas, right? Well only to an extent.

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:57.200
Imagine that I have a choice of buying
an American made TV or a TV made in

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:03.640
Malaysia. Because of lower labor costs in
Malaysia the imported TV cost $200 less

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:08.890
than the American made one. So I buy the
imported TV. That may cost jobs at a TV

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:14.330
factory in the US but I saved $200 by
buying the imported TV. And what am I

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:17.670
gonna do with those $200? I'm gonna
spend them on something I couldn't have

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:21.860
afforded if I bought the US TV. Like maybe
taking my family out to a baseball game

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:25.920
or to a restaurant. That creates jobs in
those industries that wouldn't have

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:29.690
existed if I'd bought the more expensive
TV. Economic theory suggests that

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:34.989
international trade reshuffles jobs from
one sector of the economy to another, like

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:38.769
from the TV factory to the restaurant. But the quality of these jobs can be

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:43.299
markedly different. The guy assembling
TVs at the US factory was probably

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:48.340
making a lot more at his manufacturing job
before he got reshuffled to the burrito

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:53.260
assembly line at Chipotle. Which is just
to say all this is really complicated

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:57.880
and what is good in the aggregate is not
necessarily good for individuals. For

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:01.950
example, look at the North American Free
Trade Agreement or NAFTA. It was

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:05.980
established in 1994 to drop trade
barriers between Canada, the United

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:11.769
States and Mexico. Critics point out that
NAFTA significantly increased US trade

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:16.430
deficits and they say it decreased the
number of manufacturing jobs in many

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:20.630
states, as companies moved out of the US.
Proponents of free trade point out that

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:28.080
the US economy boomed in the 1990's, creating millions
of jobs including manufacturing jobs, and that free trade

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:33.960
has decreased the prices of all sorts of consumer
goods, from vegetables to cars. So despite the fact

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:38.150
that some workers and industries were
clearly hurt, economist would tell us

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:43.190
NAFTA's had a net positive impact on all
three countries. By the way, you know

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:47.689
Thought cafÃ©, the makers of the Thought
Bubble? They're Canadian. These

00:04:47.689 --> 00:04:51.650
graphics are imported. The debate over
the value of specific trade agreements

00:04:51.659 --> 00:04:56.079
continues. But it's unlikely that the
world's largest economies will return to

00:04:56.079 --> 00:05:00.229
strict protectionism. Protectionist
policy, like placing high tariffs on

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:04.749
imports and limiting the number of
foreign goods, usually hurts an economy

00:05:04.749 --> 00:05:09.089
more than it helps. There are now several
organizations designed to eradicate

00:05:09.089 --> 00:05:15.179
protectionism, most notably the World
Trade Organization or WTO. The WTO has been

00:05:15.179 --> 00:05:19.389
effective in getting countries to agree
to specific rules and help settle

00:05:19.389 --> 00:05:23.489
disputes but it's also been accused of
favouring rich countries and not doing

00:05:23.489 --> 00:05:27.419
enough to protect the environment or
workers. Trade between countries depends

00:05:27.419 --> 00:05:31.239
on the demand for a country's goods,
political stability and interest rates,

00:05:31.239 --> 00:05:36.069
but one of the most important factors is
exchange rates. Basically this is how

00:05:36.069 --> 00:05:39.819
much your currency is worth when you
trade it for another country's currency.

00:05:39.819 --> 00:05:44.419
And let's engage in some foreign trade
now by going to the Thought Bubble. Suppose the

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:50.220
US-Mexico exchange rate is 15 pesos to the dollar.
If an American's on vacation in Mexico and wants to

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:57.180
buy some sunscreen that cost 60 pesos, they'll have to
trade four dollars for pesos. Likewise if someone from

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:03.539
Mexico is on vacation in the US and wants to buy a
$20 t-shirt she will need to exchange 300 pesos for

00:06:03.539 --> 00:06:08.169
dollars. Now one let's think about what happens
if the exchange rate goes up to twenty

00:06:08.169 --> 00:06:12.819
pesos per dollar. Now to buy that 50 peso
sunscreen in mexico it'll cost the American

00:06:12.819 --> 00:06:18.469
tourist $3 instead of four. We say that
the dollar has appreciated. At the same

00:06:18.469 --> 00:06:22.329
time the Mexican tourist who wants to
buy the $20 t-shirt will need four

00:06:22.329 --> 00:06:26.980
hundred pesos instead of 300. It works
the same way with imports and exports.

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:31.300
When the dollar appreciates, it gets
cheaper for US consumers to import

00:06:31.309 --> 00:06:37.389
foreign goods, and US exports to other
countries get more expensive. US imports

00:06:37.389 --> 00:06:40.200
rise and export fall. On the other hand

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:44.370
what if the exchange rate fell to 10
pesos per dollar? Now to buy that

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:49.530
sunscreen, the american tourist needs $6. Each dollar has gotten less powerful. We

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:53.550
say that the dollar has depreciated. At
the same time, the Mexican tourist who

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:58.150
wants to buy the $20 t-shirt needs only
two hundred pesos. So when the dollar

00:06:58.150 --> 00:07:03.470
depreciates, foreign imports get more
expensive which means they fall, and US

00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:06.950
exports to other countries get cheaper
which means they rise.

00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:10.160
Most currencies, like the peso and the
dollar have floating exchange rates that

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:13.570
change based on supply and demand. Like
when the US imports more products from

00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:17.960
Mexico, they exchange dollars for pesos.
This will increase the demand for pesos,

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:22.330
and peso will appreciate. At the same
time, the dollar will depreciate. Now some

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:25.710
countries have elected to peg their
currency to another currency. This is

00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:28.540
when a country's central bank wants to
keep the exchange rate in a certain

00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:32.170
range, and they buy or sell currencies to
keep it in that range. The Chinese

00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:35.470
government was well known for buying US
dollars to keep the Chinese currency

00:07:35.470 --> 00:07:39.110
artificially depreciated. When the US's
importing goods from China, the yuan

00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:42.310
would appreciate. Than the Chinese
government would turn around and buy

00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:46.240
dollars which kept the exchange rate
about the same. This kept Chinese exports

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:49.950
cheap for Americans. Up to this point, we
focused on exporting and importing goods

00:07:49.950 --> 00:07:53.160
and services but there's a whole other side
of international trade that involves

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:56.360
financial assets. Let's look at something
called the balance of payments. It might

00:07:56.360 --> 00:08:00.240
feel more like accounting than economics,
but it helps to show how flows of money and

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:03.920
flows of goods and services are opposite
sides of the same coin. Every country

00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:07.030
keeps an accounting statement called the
balance of payments that records all

00:08:07.030 --> 00:08:10.890
international transactions. It's made up
of two sub-accounts, the current account

00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:13.470
and the financial account, sometimes
called the capital account. The current

00:08:13.470 --> 00:08:17.280
account records the sale and purchase
of goods and services, investment income

00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:21.270
earned abroad, and other transfers like
donations and foreign aid. So when the US buys

00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:25.230
fifty billion dollars of computers from
China, that's recorded in the US current

00:08:25.230 --> 00:08:28.900
account. So this is a simplification, but
when Americans spend money on Chinese

00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:32.320
goods, the people in China, in theory, have
only two things they can do with that

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:36.180
money. They can buy US goods, or they can buy
US financial assets, like stocks and

00:08:36.180 --> 00:08:39.810
bonds. These transactions are recorded in
the other side of account, the financial

00:08:39.810 --> 00:08:42.740
account. There is a reason why the flow of
goods and the flow of money are

00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:47.220
symmetric. If consumers, businesses, and
government want to buy more stuff than their

00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:52.060
country is producing domestically, they have to import
it. So there's a trade deficit. That country has to sell

00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:56.180
assets to pay for those imports, and that's
recorded in the financial account. The United

00:08:56.190 --> 00:08:59.620
States has a very low savings rate which
means it's consuming everything it's

00:08:59.620 --> 00:09:03.130
producing and it sells assets to pay for
the additional output it brings in from

00:09:03.130 --> 00:09:07.470
overseas. Americans are choosing to run a
trade deficit. International trade, like

00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:11.700
everything else in economics, is about
trade-offs and choices and winners and

00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:16.660
losers. In purely economic terms trade
deficits and surpluses are the result of

00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:20.890
people and nations seeking their own
self-interests. But while everyone is

00:09:20.890 --> 00:09:24.830
acting in the self-interested way,
international trade doesn't always meet

00:09:24.830 --> 00:09:29.270
our individual interests. What might be
good for the wider global economy, might

00:09:29.270 --> 00:09:35.290
be really bad for me or my hometown. But
in the aggregate, trade does improve the

00:09:35.290 --> 00:09:42.180
global standard of living. It's just sometimes hard to see
up close. Thanks for watching, we'll see you next week.
