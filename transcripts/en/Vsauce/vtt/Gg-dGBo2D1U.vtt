Hey, Vsauce. Michael here,
and if you need more DONG

00:00:03.129 --> 00:00:06.909
don't worry, because I'm bringing you
more things you could do online now, guys.

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.660
"JaydenMarkAnderson" recommended Clubcreate,

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:12.920
where you can make your own remixes right
inside your browser.

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:16.309
As we listen to a song I made this morning, check out

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:19.730
LYTRO. It's a camera that records a scene's entire

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:23.600
light field, so it can be refocused
after the fact. Just click

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.760
and see the results. On the simpler side,
"mynameizLachlan" brings us

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:31.380
Small Man Chases Cursor, which is exactly

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.550
that. "DYLZAL" keeps it real with
SelfControlFreak.com, where this guy

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:36.380
points

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:40.260
where you move your mouse and when you
move your mouse towards his face

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.730
swats it away. "CaptainFsh" showed us a
sweet way to calculate your age if you

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.379
lived on other planets.

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:52.100
Venus rotates on its axis so slowly that
even though I'd 41 Venus years old there,

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.770
I'd only be 38 Venus days old.
For some creativity

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:00.770
you've got to try Reimagine - The Game,
if you haven't already. "Dadakara100"

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:02.350
recommended it and every level

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:07.670
is a whole new box of weird fun. If you want to
slow things down and get dramatic like

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:08.900
"SillyFirecracker,"

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.840
use One Chance, a game where the world will

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.710
end in six days and you have to decide how
to spend it. I played the entire game

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:18.869
last night and it was incredibly
emotional, especially

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.140
because after I finished it
I checked out Dear Photograph,

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.140
a site where people take photos from
their childhood, revisit the locations

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:27.880
and hold the picture up to match.

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:32.060
Their messages and memories are amazing.
If zombie defense strategy is more

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.350
your style, check out "MrFishguy4"
four

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.829
and Rebuild,
a turn-based game where you organize land-use,

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.799
exploratory campaigns and cross your
fingers that you keep the survivors

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:43.479
alive and the human race

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:48.100
flourishing. Finally, YourFonts.com.
On this site you can download a template

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.430
to

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:51.759
write on and then scan and upload.
The site will turn your

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:55.679
own handwriting into your very own
computer font. Nice.

00:01:55.689 --> 00:01:59.829
So there you go. A bunch of cool things
you can do online now guys.

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.540
Hey, great show, Michael.
Wait,

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:06.100
are you Kevin from Vsauce?
Yeah, how's it going?

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.690
It is fantastic to finally meet you face-to-face.
Hey, you too. What brings you here?

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.520
Well, I just wanted to announce a brand
new episode of Mind Blow over on

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:14.340
Vsauce2.

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.599
Right, right. Mind Blow on Vsauce2, because
we're finally giving both channels an

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:19.520
identity.
Yeah.

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.360
Vsauce is where I'm gonna be with funny
stuff, products and geeky pranks.

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.450
Yeah, and Vsauce2 is going to be full of
mind-blowing science,

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.230
facts and plenty of weirdos.
And riddles, right?

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:33.440
So go click right here to watch
Mind Blow on Vsauce2 if you haven't

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:34.160

because, guys, it's a great thing to do online.

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.580
GDONG? Shhhhh.

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:40.900
As always,
