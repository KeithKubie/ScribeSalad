the trans transformation or the

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319
the trans transformation or the
 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:09.140
the trans transformation or the
dissolution of one into the other and

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150
dissolution of one into the other and
 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.209
dissolution of one into the other and
then the reconstitution of that that's

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219
then the reconstitution of that that's
 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:13.640
then the reconstitution of that that's
what an election does right it's like

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650
what an election does right it's like
 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.390
what an election does right it's like
okay we have our leader who's the person

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400
okay we have our leader who's the person
 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.519
okay we have our leader who's the person
at the top of the dominance hierarchy

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529
at the top of the dominance hierarchy
 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.800
at the top of the dominance hierarchy
and defines the nature of this

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810
and defines the nature of this
 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.660
and defines the nature of this
particular structure there's an election

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670
particular structure there's an election
 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.810
particular structure there's an election
it's regulated chaos no one knows what's

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820
it's regulated chaos no one knows what's
 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.429
it's regulated chaos no one knows what's
going to happen it's the death of the

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439
going to happen it's the death of the
 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.220
going to happen it's the death of the
old king bang we go into a chaotic state

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230
old king bang we go into a chaotic state
 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.770
old king bang we go into a chaotic state
everyone argues for a while and then out

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780
everyone argues for a while and then out
 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.389
everyone argues for a while and then out
of that argument they produce a

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399
of that argument they produce a
 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.930
of that argument they produce a
consensus and poof we're in a new state

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:37.940
consensus and poof we're in a new state
 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.209
consensus and poof we're in a new state
right that's the meta story right order

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219
right that's the meta story right order
 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.100
right that's the meta story right order
chaos order but it's partial order chaos

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:45.110
chaos order but it's partial order chaos
 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:47.330
chaos order but it's partial order chaos
reconstituted and revivified order

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340
reconstituted and revivified order
 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.580
reconstituted and revivified order
that's the thing is that this order is

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590
that's the thing is that this order is
 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.500
that's the thing is that this order is
better than that order so there's

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510
better than that order so there's
 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.959
better than that order so there's
progress and that's partly why I think

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969
progress and that's partly why I think
 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.880
progress and that's partly why I think
the idea of moral relativism is wrong

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890
the idea of moral relativism is wrong
 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.849
the idea of moral relativism is wrong
there's progress in moral order and and

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859
there's progress in moral order and and
 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.459
there's progress in moral order and and
it was defined properly by Piaget the

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469
it was defined properly by Piaget the
 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:02.990
it was defined properly by Piaget the
new moral order does everything the

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000
new moral order does everything the
 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.939
new moral order does everything the
other baurel the old moral order did and

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949
other baurel the old moral order did and
 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.340
other baurel the old moral order did and
some additional things that's what

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350
some additional things that's what
 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.490
some additional things that's what
constitutes progress now here's a here's

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500
constitutes progress now here's a here's
 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.490
constitutes progress now here's a here's
a strange idea and we'll talk about this

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500
a strange idea and we'll talk about this
 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.080
a strange idea and we'll talk about this
more as we progress through the class

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090
more as we progress through the class
 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.999
more as we progress through the class
what's the ultimate in order well it's

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009
what's the ultimate in order well it's
 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.910
what's the ultimate in order well it's
not this obviously because it can

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920
not this obviously because it can
 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.420
not this obviously because it can
collapse and it's not this because it

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430
collapse and it's not this because it
 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.370
collapse and it's not this because it
can collapse and so then you think well

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380
can collapse and so then you think well
 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:29.719
can collapse and so then you think well
there's no ultimate order even though

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729
there's no ultimate order even though
 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.880
there's no ultimate order even though
there's progression but then you have to

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890
there's progression but then you have to
 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.370
there's progression but then you have to
move it up one level of abstraction

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:33.380
move it up one level of abstraction
 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:37.060
move it up one level of abstraction
what's the ultimate order doing this

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:37.070
what's the ultimate order doing this
 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.580
what's the ultimate order doing this
willingness to do that that's the

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590
willingness to do that that's the
 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.069
willingness to do that that's the
ultimate order right it's order at a

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079
ultimate order right it's order at a
 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:44.870
ultimate order right it's order at a
different level of analysis and you can

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880
different level of analysis and you can
 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.260
different level of analysis and you can
see that's what's represented in that

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.270
see that's what's represented in that
 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.120
see that's what's represented in that
idea that's what that idea means that's

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130
idea that's what that idea means that's
 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.010
idea that's what that idea means that's
the Phoenix right the Phoenix is

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020
the Phoenix right the Phoenix is
 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.039
the Phoenix right the Phoenix is
something that lives ages and then

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049
something that lives ages and then
 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.440
something that lives ages and then
allows itself to be consumed by fire and

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450
allows itself to be consumed by fire and
 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.410
allows itself to be consumed by fire and
then re-emerges and the old phoenix gets

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420
then re-emerges and the old phoenix gets
 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.709
then re-emerges and the old phoenix gets
old and burns and the new Phoenix

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719
old and burns and the new Phoenix
 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.690
old and burns and the new Phoenix
re-emerges it so the real Phoenix is the

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700
re-emerges it so the real Phoenix is the
 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.730
re-emerges it so the real Phoenix is the
thing that's constant across those

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740
thing that's constant across those
 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:08.839
thing that's constant across those
transformations

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849
transformations
 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:12.710
transformations
that's the Union self that's what he

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720
that's the Union self that's what he
 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.610
that's the Union self that's what he
meant

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620
meant
 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.160
meant
the self is the element of the psyche

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170
the self is the element of the psyche
 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.610
the self is the element of the psyche
that remains intact across

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620
that remains intact across
 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.280
that remains intact across
transformations yeah yeah it's a bloody

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290
transformations yeah yeah it's a bloody
 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.000
transformations yeah yeah it's a bloody
amazing idea that's for sure and you

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010
amazing idea that's for sure and you
 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:27.020
amazing idea that's for sure and you
could think about that

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030
could think about that
 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.510
could think about that
that's why Jung claimed for example an

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520
that's why Jung claimed for example an
 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:33.080
that's why Jung claimed for example an
ion primarily that Christ was a symbol

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090
ion primarily that Christ was a symbol
 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:38.330
ion primarily that Christ was a symbol
of the self that was his consequence of

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340
of the self that was his consequence of
 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.850
of the self that was his consequence of
decades of meditation on the structure

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860
decades of meditation on the structure
 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.970
decades of meditation on the structure
of Christianity because it's the dying

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980
of Christianity because it's the dying
 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.070
of Christianity because it's the dying
and resurrecting part of the psyche that

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080
and resurrecting part of the psyche that
 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.740
and resurrecting part of the psyche that
remains constant across the

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750
remains constant across the
 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.880
remains constant across the
transformation so the ultimate order

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890
transformation so the ultimate order
 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:55.309
transformation so the ultimate order
isn't to identify with this that's your

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:55.319
isn't to identify with this that's your
 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:57.229
isn't to identify with this that's your
current state of being and it isn't

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239
current state of being and it isn't
 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:00.170
current state of being and it isn't
identify with that because well you

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180
identify with that because well you
 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.960
identify with that because well you
can't by definition and it isn't even to

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970
can't by definition and it isn't even to
 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:06.289
can't by definition and it isn't even to
identify with that it's to let these

00:03:06.289 --> 00:03:06.299
identify with that it's to let these
 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:08.600
identify with that it's to let these
things go as they need to go that's a

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610
things go as they need to go that's a
 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:11.570
things go as they need to go that's a
sacrifice and to allow this continual

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:11.580
sacrifice and to allow this continual
 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:13.430
sacrifice and to allow this continual
process of transformation to occur and

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440
process of transformation to occur and
 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.800
process of transformation to occur and
part of that is the admission that

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810
part of that is the admission that
 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:17.630
part of that is the admission that
you're wrong and so partly what you're

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640
you're wrong and so partly what you're
 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.690
you're wrong and so partly what you're
doing is at micro levels and at macro

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700
doing is at micro levels and at macro
 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.210
doing is at micro levels and at macro
levels where are you not what you could

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220
levels where are you not what you could
 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.000
levels where are you not what you could
be and when you realize that it'll take

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010
be and when you realize that it'll take
 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.430
be and when you realize that it'll take
you apart a little bit and burn you down

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440
you apart a little bit and burn you down
 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.699
you apart a little bit and burn you down
to your core a little bit and then allow

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709
to your core a little bit and then allow
 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:33.530
to your core a little bit and then allow
you to regenerate and if you do that

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540
you to regenerate and if you do that
 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:35.390
you to regenerate and if you do that
continually then everything that you

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400
continually then everything that you
 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:41.030
continually then everything that you
don't need burns away right and that's

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040
don't need burns away right and that's
 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.059
don't need burns away right and that's
what this means you remember in Harry

00:03:44.059 --> 00:03:44.069
what this means you remember in Harry
 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:47.599
what this means you remember in Harry
Potter you may remember that Harry goes

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:47.609
Potter you may remember that Harry goes
 

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:50.629
Potter you may remember that Harry goes
down so in the second volume and in the

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:50.639
down so in the second volume and in the
 

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:53.449
down so in the second volume and in the
second movie Harry's at Hogwarts so it's

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:53.459
second movie Harry's at Hogwarts so it's
 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:54.860
second movie Harry's at Hogwarts so it's
the school where you learn how to be

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870
the school where you learn how to be
 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:56.539
the school where you learn how to be
