POORNIMA VIJAYASHANKER: Hi,
I'm Poornima Vijayashanker,

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:14.430
the founder of Femgineer.

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:16.540
Femgineer is an
education company

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:19.140
where we help techies,
like yourselves,

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.950
level up in your careers and
build products and companies.

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:27.120
Now, like many of you, I got my
start as a software engineer.

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:29.750
I was heads down, writing
code, shipping product,

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:32.090
putting in long
hours, secretly hoping

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:33.720
that someone would
notice all my effort

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:37.710
and let me pick the projects
I wanted and get promoted.

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.690
But, unfortunately,
despite all my long hours,

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:43.686
I got passed up for
promotions and projects.

00:00:43.686 --> 00:00:45.060
So then I thought,
you know what?

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:46.560
I'll just put in more hours.

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:48.290
I'll learn to write more code.

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:52.550
I'll learn a new programming
language, and that'll help.

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:53.620
But it didn't.

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:55.292
In fact, it only
made matters worse.

00:00:55.292 --> 00:00:57.250
And that's when I realized
what I needed to do.

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:59.320
I needed to speak up.

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.886
But "speaking up," you know,
it sounds so self-promotional.

00:01:01.886 --> 00:01:05.189
It sounds like you only care
about what you're working on.

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:06.730
And, you know, why
would anybody care

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:08.938
about what you're working
on when all they care about

00:01:08.938 --> 00:01:10.630
is the end goal
or the end result?

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:12.430
It's scary to think about.

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:13.600
People might judge you.

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.154
They might wonder, you
know, who are you to speak?

00:01:16.154 --> 00:01:18.570
Especially if you're only a
couple years into your career.

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.319
You might be thinking,
you know, I've only

00:01:20.319 --> 00:01:23.330
been coding for two weeks, two
months, or two years, or two

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:24.300
decades.

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:25.790
Or, I'm new to a role.

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:27.180
I'm not exactly an expert.

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.200
Why would anybody care
about what I have to say?

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.180
I don't know, you know,
what to talk about.

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.755
And so often we think, you
know, we're just not an expert,

00:01:35.755 --> 00:01:38.100
we might as well keep our
mouth shut because it's

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.250
too self-promotional.

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:43.660
But I discovered a way in which
I could speak up for myself

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:46.380
and showcase my
worth authentically.

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.000
And that was by
teaching people--

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.850
teaching them about
the work I was doing,

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.310
the results I was
getting, and giving them

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.550
a step-by-step process to
replicate it, because there's

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:00.610
always somebody out there who's
a beginner, who wants to learn,

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:03.080
just like what you went through.

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.800
And by showcasing your work
and teaching them, they care.

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:10.139
And they can
actually learn a lot.

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:12.020
So it's actually a
very effective form

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:14.870
of learning to come out and hear
you speak, because the stories

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:16.710
that you share are repeatable.

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:17.920
And they're memorable.

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.020
And for many people, that's
what they care about,

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:23.180
not just sitting at
home and reading a book

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.360
or doing a Google search--
no offense to our host.

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.740
They're coming out
to hear you speak.

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:31.665
And what they want to
know from all of you is,

00:02:31.665 --> 00:02:33.860
you know, what were
your experiences?

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:38.240
What were your perspectives
on a project, or even learning

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.080
how to build a
product or learning

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.190
a new language or a framework?

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:44.940
And oftentimes even
some of those moments

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:46.870
we have where we
feel like, oh, it

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:49.550
took me years to
learn how to code,

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:51.890
or it took me months to
get through to my team,

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:54.292
or it took me years to
shape a product, you know,

00:02:54.292 --> 00:02:55.750
all those moments
that we think are

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:59.010
failures are actually really
valuable for other people

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:00.047
to hear.

00:03:00.047 --> 00:03:01.380
Because think about it this way.

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.320
Those years of
effort you put in,

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:05.150
all those gotcha
moments you had,

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.090
all those things that you wished
you could have done better,

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:11.030
well, now they are
treasures for other people.

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:13.500
You're going to help them
fast track their learning,

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.080
and that's really valuable.

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:16.040
They want to know that.

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:17.760
They want to accelerate
their career,

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.760
and you're helping
them to do it.

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.540
So in the end, it's
an authentic way

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:26.030
of showcasing all the hard
work that you've done.

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:28.550
Now, you might be wondering,
how do you do this, right?

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:30.610
So Karen Catlin,
my co-author, and I

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:32.670
have come up with
the Inventory Method.

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:35.240
And the way that the Inventory
Method works is you're

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:37.710
going to take stock of all
the projects you've done

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:40.112
over the last 3 to 12 months.

00:03:40.112 --> 00:03:41.820
The reason we say 3
to 12 is because it's

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:43.369
what's freshest in your mind.

00:03:43.369 --> 00:03:45.660
And since we're in tech and
things move pretty quickly,

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.030
it's also what's most relevant.

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.040
Now, as you take
stock, you'll notice

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.870
some themes start to emerge.

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:54.395
And these themes can then
be crafted into a topic.

00:03:54.395 --> 00:03:56.520
And then if you're worried
about what people think,

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:59.420
well, you can share the
topic with your coworkers,

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:01.960
your teammates, and your
friends or people who you think

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:03.780
are going to be the audience.

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.290
And when you do this,
you'll notice a few things

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:07.225
start to emerge.

00:04:07.225 --> 00:04:08.350
Let me give you an example.

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:10.780
For myself, when I
was getting started,

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:13.580
I decided that I wanted to
speak at a local conference.

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:16.339
I signed up, and I was about
two years into my career.

00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:18.005
I was the founding
engineer of Mint.com,

00:04:18.005 --> 00:04:19.546
and I thought, why
would anybody want

00:04:19.546 --> 00:04:20.756
to hear what I have to say?

00:04:20.756 --> 00:04:22.380
But it turns out it
was really valuable

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:24.760
for me to share my experience
building a prototype,

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:26.360
launching it, and scaling it.

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:28.230
And as a result,
people came out.

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:29.360
They heard me speak.

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:30.870
They wanted to
come work at Mint.

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:32.707
And a lot of people saw
me and thought, wow,

00:04:32.707 --> 00:04:34.040
I want to learn from this woman.

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:36.680
She's a go-to resource
for startups, engineering,

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:38.360
and entrepreneurship.

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.940
So realize that when you
speak, opportunities emerge

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:44.260
and you're making a
difference, both in your life

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.020
and your career,
but someone else's.

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:48.800
You're helping them fast
track their learning.

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:50.550
If you've enjoyed
this and enjoyed

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:52.690
learning about the method,
like Inventory Method,

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:54.660
we've got a lot of
other great techniques

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:56.910
for you in our
latest book "Present!

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:58.980
A Techie's Guide to
Public Speaking."

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:01.040
Come by our booth
and pick up a copy.

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:01.940
Thank you.

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:03.140
