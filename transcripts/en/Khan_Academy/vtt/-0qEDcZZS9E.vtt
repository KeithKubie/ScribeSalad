00:00:00.324 --> 00:00:03.422
We can never have too much practice
getting familiar with vectors.

00:00:03.422 --> 00:00:05.711
What I want to do
in this video in particular,

00:00:05.711 --> 00:00:08.991
be able to relate
the &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt; components of a vector

00:00:09.006 --> 00:00:11.616
to the initial and terminal points
to where we place it

00:00:11.616 --> 00:00:13.141
in the coordinate planes.

00:00:13.141 --> 00:00:14.488
What am I talking about?

00:00:14.488 --> 00:00:21.048
Let's say we have some vector
where its initial point is here at point &lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;

00:00:21.051 --> 00:00:28.081
and its terminal point
is here at point &lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;.

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:37.960
The vector will look like this
in green.

00:00:40.519 --> 00:00:48.079
So that's what the vector looks like.

00:00:58.861 --> 00:01:02.511
It has an initial point at &lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;
and the terminal point at &lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;.

00:01:02.511 --> 00:01:05.388
What I want to do is,
if I know the coordinates of &lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;

00:01:05.388 --> 00:01:11.968
figure out the &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt; components
of my vector &lt;i&gt;v&lt;/i&gt;.

00:01:14.953 --> 00:01:19.371
So what are the coordinates of &lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;?

00:01:19.371 --> 00:01:25.981
The &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; coordinate is
-1,-2,-3,-4,-5,-6,-7,-8.

00:01:27.016 --> 00:01:30.205
So &lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt; = (-8,

00:01:30.205 --> 00:01:36.945
and the &lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt; coordinate is
1,2,3,4,5,6,7.

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:42.550
So &lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;=(-8, 7)

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:47.319
and point &lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;, the terminal point
of the vector, has the coordinates...

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:52.961
1,2,3,4,5,6,7.
b=(7,

00:01:56.135 --> 00:02:00.248
and then the &lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt; coordinate is
-1,-2.

00:02:00.248 --> 00:02:02.380
&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;=(7, -2).

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:05.386
So, given that, what are going to be
the &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt; components

00:02:05.386 --> 00:02:06.882
of our vector &lt;i&gt;v&lt;/i&gt; ?

00:02:06.882 --> 00:02:10.536
Well, let's think about it,
our vector &lt;i&gt;v&lt;/i&gt;.

00:02:10.536 --> 00:02:14.700
There are multiple ways
that we can express a vector,

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:20.050
one way is to use
the unit vector notation,

00:02:20.071 --> 00:02:25.304
where whatever is in parentheses
is our &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; component,

00:02:25.304 --> 00:02:29.614
and whatever is in these parentheses
is our &lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt; component.

00:02:29.614 --> 00:02:33.913
I'm really just scaling up the unit vector
in the horizontal direction

00:02:33.913 --> 00:02:36.675
and the unit vector
in the vertical direction.

00:02:36.675 --> 00:02:39.683
You could look at the videos
on unit vector notation

00:02:39.683 --> 00:02:41.955
if this looks foreign to you.

00:02:41.955 --> 00:02:44.870
But let's figure out
what the &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; component is going to be.

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:47.545
One way to think about it is,
you could just view it as the change in &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;

00:02:47.545 --> 00:02:49.891
between the initial point
and the terminal point.

00:02:49.891 --> 00:02:52.593
So the change in &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; is going to be

00:02:52.593 --> 00:02:59.993
the terminal &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;, 7 minus the initial &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;, -8

00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:03.854
and our &lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt; component
you can just view as a change in &lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt;

00:03:03.854 --> 00:03:07.133
from the initial point
to the terminal point.

00:03:07.133 --> 00:03:10.871
So we finish at the terminal point,

00:03:10.871 --> 00:03:18.001
that is -2 minus our initial &lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt;, -7.

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:24.062
And so what does this give us?

00:03:24.062 --> 00:03:29.532
7 minus -8,
that's the same as 7 plus 8,

00:03:31.921 --> 00:03:35.652
that's equal to 15.

00:03:35.652 --> 00:03:43.062
So 15 times &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;
plus -2 minus 7, that's -9,

00:03:54.204 --> 00:03:59.854
or -9&lt;i&gt;j&lt;/i&gt;.
That's one way to write our vector.

00:03:59.854 --> 00:04:04.131
Another way is to just remember
there are a bunch of different notations

00:04:04.131 --> 00:04:05.855
people use for vectors.

00:04:05.855 --> 00:04:12.095
You could write it like this;
you could just say it's 15, -9.

00:04:18.425 --> 00:04:21.112
These are different representations
of the same vector.

00:04:21.112 --> 00:04:25.688
You could even write it like this,
vector &lt;i&gt;v&lt;/i&gt;, you could write it as

00:04:25.688 --> 00:04:32.029
a column vector, 15, -9.

00:04:32.029 --> 00:04:34.989
So depending on what book or notation
or class you're in,

00:04:34.989 --> 00:04:37.111
you might see all of these things,

00:04:37.111 --> 00:04:39.716
but these are all the same vectors
that you know and love.

00:04:39.716 --> 00:04:44.025
We can see that over here,

00:04:44.025 --> 00:04:48.340
15 &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt; is going to be a vector that's
15 times bigger than the unit vector

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:50.889
in the horizontal direction.

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:58.039
So 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15.

00:05:05.009 --> 00:05:10.079
So this is the vector 15 &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;.

00:05:16.313 --> 00:05:21.256
And the vector -9 &lt;i&gt;j&lt;/i&gt;
is going to go down 9,

00:05:21.256 --> 00:05:25.806
so 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9.

00:05:25.808 --> 00:05:30.978
So -9 &lt;i&gt;j&lt;/i&gt; is going to look like this.

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:45.185
And you see if you take 15 &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;
plus -9 &lt;i&gt;j&lt;/i&gt;,

00:05:45.185 --> 00:05:48.685
you're going to get
our entire vector &lt;i&gt;v&lt;/i&gt;,

00:05:48.685 --> 00:05:50.479
which is exactly what we wrote here.

00:05:50.479 --> 00:05:54.259
You could say the &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; component is 15,
the &lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt; component is -9.

00:05:54.259 --> 00:05:57.413
Or another way to say it is,
to go from point &lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt; to point &lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;,

00:05:57.413 --> 00:05:59.779
your change in &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;,
you increased 15,

00:05:59.779 --> 00:06:02.266
your change in &lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt;,
you decreased 9.

00:06:02.266 --> 00:06:04.575
That tells you the &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt; components

00:06:04.575 --> 00:06:07.120
of the vector that starts here
and ends there.

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:11.654
This just happens to be
where we placed this vector,

00:06:11.654 --> 00:06:14.935
we might choose to shift them around,
but the important thing is

00:06:14.935 --> 00:06:19.755
that they keep the same
magnitude and direction.
