00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.930
So we've all got standard-issue tongues, taste
buds, brains. Why does food taste differently

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:06.870
to different people?

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:13.870
Anthony here for Dnews. I am NOT hot sauce
fan and my dad loves. He puts that on everything.

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.980
I have a friend who loves the taste the black
licorice, but black licorice makes me sick.

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:27.250
The three of us are from similar cultural
backgrounds, so why don't we like the same

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:27.940
stuff?

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:31.760
Now some people are super tasters and some
are subtasters.

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:36.579
Super tasters have an ability that you probably
already guessed. They can taste subtleties

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:38.190
that other people can't.

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.600
Subtasters are far less sensitive and there's
an easy way to tell which one you are.

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.499
But first, a little bit about your sense of
taste. Okay you've got your taste buds. They're

00:00:45.499 --> 00:00:48.760
mostly on your tongue, but you've also got
some on your throat and on the roof of your

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:49.109
mouth.

00:00:49.109 --> 00:00:52.519
Each one is contained in something called
a fungiform papillae.

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:57.489
Now using these miraculous receptors, you
are hard-wired to experience five different

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:01.460
kinds and tastes: sweet, sour, salty, bitter
and umami.

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:06.400
Now umami is basically savory. It's named
in Japanese because that's where it was discovered.

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:11.020
Now there's some current research that says
we're also specifically built to taste fat,

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.840
but we're not sure of that.

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.210
Now you can taste those flavors anywhere on
your tongue. A lot of people have been told

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:20.410
that you can only experience different flavors
on different sections, but that's actually

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:23.430
a misconception that comes from some very
outdated research.

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:29.110
So, everything you taste has some combination
of those five flavors in different intensities.

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:31.450
And that's where everything gets there unique
taste.

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:36.500
Now people with a high density of fungiform
papillae are much more sensitive to those

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.510
different tastes. Those are the super tasters.

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:41.670
They tend to favor things that are more mild.

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:48.110
Now super tasters also have subtle brain differences
in an area called the gustatory cortex, conveniently

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:51.290
located next to the bits that control chewing
and swallowing.

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:53.570
That's some good organization, brain.

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:57.900
Super tasters also tend to have heightened
senses of smell because smell is intensely

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:59.460
connected to taste.

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.010
But what's the benefit? Why is it good to
be a super taser and why are we wired to taste

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:05.850
those five specific flavors?

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:11.439
Well, sweet foods are high in calories so
when we were hunter-gatherers, finding high-calorie

00:02:11.439 --> 00:02:13.629
food was important for survival.

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:18.140
Bitter tastes signal poisonous plants like
that black licorice flavor.

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:24.010
Salty foods have important minerals and vitamins.
So a super taster can find healthier foods

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.590
and avoid dangerous ones more easily.

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:31.260
Now about 25 percent of the population are
super tasters and there's an easy test to

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.560
figure out whether you are one of them.

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.760
First, drill a small hole into your skull
above the gustatory cortex.

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:38.829
What?

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:40.420
Okay I'm not allowed to do that one.

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:46.569
Here's a test from PopSci instead. Grab some
blue food coloring, and put it all over your

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:47.109
tongue.

00:02:47.109 --> 00:02:51.780
Blue dye cannot stick to your taste papillae,
so if your tongue doesn't look like a smurf,

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.400
you're most likely super tester.

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:58.450
If it looks like mine, you're a sub taster.
But WHATEVER!

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:01.200
I don't want to have a cool sensitive palate
anyway.

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.249
Test yourself and let me know your results.
Throw your favorite and least favorite flavors
