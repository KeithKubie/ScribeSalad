00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
This change can be arbitrarily long.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:08.000
As long as all the keys along the chain are consistent and chained together in the right way,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
as long as we start with a root that we trust already,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
we can validate certificates signed by any of the parties along the chain.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
We could, in theory, use Google to validate a new certificate

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
and add another layer to the chain.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
What I want to do in the forums is encourage some open discussion,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
encourage you to find interesting certificate chains on the web,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
see what the longest one you can find is, and post those in the forum

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
as well as any interesting things you find along these paths.
