00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:13.330
Technology can't enhance humanity, that it's
depersonalizing, that it's going to detract.

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:19.710
I actually think it's just the opposite in
medicine, because if we can outsource to machines

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:25.750
and technology, we can restore the human bond,
which has been eroding for decades.

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:32.740
So what I mean by deep medicine is really
a three part story: The first is what we call

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:34.580
deep phenotyping.

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:43.010
And that is a very intensive, comprehensive
understanding of each person at every level.

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:49.150
So that's the idea of knowing all about their
biology, not just their genome, their microbiome,

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:55.129
and all the things the different layers of
the person, but also their physiology through

00:00:55.129 --> 00:01:00.920
sensors, their anatomy through scans, their
environment through sensors as well, and then

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.620
traditional data.

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:04.080
So that's deep phenotyping.

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:11.250
Now, no human being can process all that data,
because it's dynamic, and it's actually quite

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.860
large to deal with.

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:15.000
That's why we have deep learning.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:22.140
That's a type of artificial intelligence which
takes all of these inputs and it really crystallizes,

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.729
distills it all.

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.200
And that gets us to deep empathy.

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:31.659
And the deep empathy is when we have this
outsourcing to machines and algorithms.

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:36.560
We have all of this data, and we now can get
back to the human side of this connection.

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:41.920
Well, where deep learning works the best today
is with images.

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:48.290
And so medical images are especially ideal
because it turns out that radiologists miss

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:53.420
things in more than 30 percent of scans that
are done today.

00:01:53.420 --> 00:02:00.160
So in order to not miss these things, you
can train machines to have vision better than

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:01.160
humans.

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:06.470
The difference here is that the radiologists
can put more context in it, but the machines,

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:07.880
they're very complementary.

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:13.180
They can pick up things that radiologists
wouldn't see, like a nodule on a chest X-ray

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:19.720
or an abnormality on an MRA that would be
missed because radiologists read 50 to 100

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:20.940
scans per day.

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.320
There's many times that we just don't see
things.

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:27.610
So when you bring the two together, you get
the best economy.

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:30.810
It doesn't mean we're going to eliminate the
need for radiologists.

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.760
It's going to make the accuracy and the speed
much better.

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.800
And what I project is that we're going to
see a time when radiologists move out of the

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:44.410
basement in the dark and actually connect
with patients, because they want to see patients.

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:49.530
They want to be able to share their expertise,
and they don't have a vested interest about

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.850
doing an operation or procedure.

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:55.700
They just want to report what they find and
communicate that.

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:02.430
So I think we're going to see a reshaping
of radiology because of this remarkable performance

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.720
enhancement through AI.

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:10.570
There's a lot of use of AI in the hospital
setting, because when patients come in, and

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:15.400
trying to predict what's going to happen,
we're not so good at that generally in medicine.

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:20.900
So almost everything you can think of there
have been algorithms tested.

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:22.860
One example is sepsis.

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:24.170
So what's going to happen?

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:27.370
Does the person have sepsis, a serious infection?

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:31.320
Are they going to decompensate and possibly
die from sepsis?

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:34.110
We're not so great at that, it turns out,
by algorithm.

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:41.500
But what we have learned is that we can use
the same machine vision, whether it's nurses,

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:47.390
doctors, people who are circulating in a room
of a hospital, to see whether or not they're

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:54.260
doing appropriate handwashing, and to set
off a signal that, no, it wasn't done and

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:55.420
needs to be done.

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:59.250
So there's lots of things about patient safety
with machine vision.

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:05.060
So for example, preventing falls, seeing that
someone's walking is unsteady.

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:07.870
Another great example is in the intensive
care unit.

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:12.550
Some people can pull out their breathing tube,
and now we have machine vision that can monitor

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:16.420
that so that we don't have a nurse that has
to be in the room all of the time.

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:22.180
Well, the biggest thing that we need down
is the gift of time.

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:24.790
Rather than to have this AI support?

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:27.340
And it's at two levels.

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:33.310
So if you can get rid of keyboards, or liberate
from keyboards, reestablish face-to-face eye

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:35.130
contact, that's a good start.

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:36.260
It's going to happen.

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:42.540
But also the patients now can have algorithms
generating their own data, whether it's their

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:49.380
heart rhythm, or their skin rash, or a possible
urinary tract infection, they can get that

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:52.820
diagnosed now by an algorithm.

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:57.700
That frees up, again, doctors to take care
of more serious matters, and that's what is

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:03.030
so exciting if we grab this opportunity, which
I don't know if we'll see it again for generations,

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:06.790
if ever, because this technology offers that
potential.

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:08.600
But it won't happen by accident.

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:16.400
If we're not taking on this, really, activism
to promote the gift of time and turning inward,

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:20.730
as the medical community, if we don't do this,
we're going to see even worse squeeze than

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:21.880
we have now.

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:24.730
This is an opportunity that we just can't
miss.
