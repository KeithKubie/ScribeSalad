00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:04.890
Now that we've identified what should be
our promoted action, let's create one.

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.640
The designs port library implements all
the features one would have to build

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:12.920
into a fab, like touch elevation and
interaction with other elements.

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:17.650
Some features, like ripples, are not
supported in all versions of Android,

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:20.130
even with the use of
the support library.

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.550
Depending on when your
project was created, or

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:25.570
what version of Android Studio
you use to create it,

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:29.410
the project might already have some
of the things I'm going to add.

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:33.120
On the other hand, you'll likely come
across a legacy app that you would need

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.420
to update, so
it's good to know what to look for.

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.470
First you'll need to add these two
lines to your build.gradle file.

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:43.980
I'll explain why we need
appcompat in just a second.

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.473
The design library adds
several widgets and

00:00:46.473 --> 00:00:50.052
layouts that make implementing
material design much easier.

00:00:50.052 --> 00:00:54.802
22.2.0 was the most recent version
at the time of recording, but

00:00:54.802 --> 00:00:57.586
use whatever is the latest and greatest.

00:00:57.586 --> 00:01:01.573
So here's our definition of the floating
action button that will be in our

00:01:01.573 --> 00:01:02.357
layout file.

00:01:02.357 --> 00:01:06.434
So as you can see some of these
attributes are on the app namespace, and

00:01:06.434 --> 00:01:08.314
some are on Android namespace.

00:01:08.314 --> 00:01:10.752
Let's focus on the app ones.

00:01:10.752 --> 00:01:16.510
So as Nick mentioned before,
the fab can be normal sized or mini.

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:18.930
This corresponds to 56dp.

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:23.204
Next we have an elevation,
a resting elevation for

00:01:23.204 --> 00:01:26.544
our floating action button,
we want that to be 6dp.

00:01:26.544 --> 00:01:29.635
One thing that might be
new is layout gravity.

00:01:29.635 --> 00:01:34.855
Assuming a left to right layout system,
end is a synonym for right.

00:01:34.855 --> 00:01:38.925
So it should lay out the fab to
the right of whatever element or

00:01:38.925 --> 00:01:40.380
your layout.

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.640
Next is the pressedTranslationZ
property of 12dp, so

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.040
when this button is pressed,
we want it to raise to a total of 12dp.

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.725
That's followed by a bunch of attributes
here that you've probably already

00:01:52.725 --> 00:01:53.685
seen before.

00:01:53.685 --> 00:01:56.895
So we're not going to go over
these point by point right now.

00:01:56.895 --> 00:02:01.075
Now, if we try to build this right now,
it'll refuse to run properly.

00:02:01.075 --> 00:02:04.305
Android Studio will first complain
that there was an error inflating

00:02:04.305 --> 00:02:05.855
the floating action button.

00:02:05.855 --> 00:02:09.940
That's because the fab needs
AppCompat for style information.

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:11.830
To resolve this last error,

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:16.660
we need to replace instances
of Material with AppCompat.

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.360
And then you're all set.

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.160
You're fab will elevate and
show ripples when touched.

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.850
And you can treat it like
any other button in your UI.
