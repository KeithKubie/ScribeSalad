00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:04.265
My sincere congratulations to you. You've just finished working through one of

00:00:04.265 --> 00:00:08.500
the most difficult areas of interactive 3-D graphics. Between transforms and

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:12.635
materials, you've learned two critical elements of the field. You can create and

00:00:12.635 --> 00:00:16.426
display 3-D objects in your own virtual worlds. I think of this point in the

00:00:16.426 --> 00:00:19.808
course as the top of the roller coaster ride. That slow part where you come to

00:00:19.808 --> 00:00:24.160
the top of the rise and the tracks ahead come into view. With these basics down

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.700
we can now explore areas that will let you create even richer scenes and

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:30.013
applications. It's going to be a wild ride.
