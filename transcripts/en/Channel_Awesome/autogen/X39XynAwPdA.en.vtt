00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340
cartoons when you really think about are
 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.699
cartoons when you really think about are
kind of quiet cartoons at least when

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709
kind of quiet cartoons at least when
 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:51.440
kind of quiet cartoons at least when
thinking of the older ones yeah there's

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450
thinking of the older ones yeah there's
 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.089
thinking of the older ones yeah there's
the song in the beginning and end but

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:53.099
the song in the beginning and end but
 

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:55.550
the song in the beginning and end but
they're usually very quiet and a lot of

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560
they're usually very quiet and a lot of
 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.220

it this sort of lazily dubbed over but

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230
it this sort of lazily dubbed over but
 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.860
it this sort of lazily dubbed over but
it kind of didn't matter it just our had

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870
it kind of didn't matter it just our had
 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:02.960
it kind of didn't matter it just our had
its own feel to it and that's kind of

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970
its own feel to it and that's kind of
 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:04.490
its own feel to it and that's kind of
what I think of with this movie

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500
what I think of with this movie
 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.620
what I think of with this movie
it's just kind of its own weird thing

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630
it's just kind of its own weird thing
 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:09.470
it's just kind of its own weird thing
and I think if it was trying too hard to

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480
and I think if it was trying too hard to
 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.420
and I think if it was trying too hard to
have so much action and adventure and

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430
have so much action and adventure and
 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.130
have so much action and adventure and
too many jokes then maybe it couldn't

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140
too many jokes then maybe it couldn't
 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.289
too many jokes then maybe it couldn't
work but I think because it is so slow

00:03:15.289 --> 00:03:15.299
work but I think because it is so slow
 

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:17.210
work but I think because it is so slow
