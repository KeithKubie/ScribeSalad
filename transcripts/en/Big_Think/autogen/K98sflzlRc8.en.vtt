00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310
I noticed that response is not word for
 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.520
I noticed that response is not word for
word directly responsive to her question

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530
word directly responsive to her question
 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.859
word directly responsive to her question
what they responded to was they felt

anymore I've reached my limit and it's a

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369
anymore I've reached my limit and it's a
 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.389
anymore I've reached my limit and it's a
way to establish a limit in a way that

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399
way to establish a limit in a way that
 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:09.740
way to establish a limit in a way that
doesn't back the other side into a

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750
doesn't back the other side into a
 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.190
doesn't back the other side into a
corner you really want to be able to let

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200
corner you really want to be able to let
 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.850
corner you really want to be able to let
out know

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860
out know
 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.060
out know
a little bit at a time and the first way

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.070
a little bit at a time and the first way
 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:18.770
a little bit at a time and the first way
to start letting out know as an answer

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780
to start letting out know as an answer
 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.400
to start letting out know as an answer
is how am I supposed to do that now

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410
is how am I supposed to do that now
 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.260
is how am I supposed to do that now
ultimately with that question we all

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270
ultimately with that question we all
 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.600
ultimately with that question we all
imagine that the other side is going to

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610
imagine that the other side is going to
 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.040
imagine that the other side is going to
say because I said so

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050
say because I said so
 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:31.790
say because I said so
because you have to that's actually

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800
because you have to that's actually
 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.530
because you have to that's actually
where you ultimately want to be with

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540
where you ultimately want to be with
 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.410
where you ultimately want to be with
that question because when you say how

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420
that question because when you say how
 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:37.820
that question because when you say how
am I supposed to do that and the other

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830
am I supposed to do that and the other
 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:39.560
am I supposed to do that and the other
side says because if you want this deal

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:39.570
side says because if you want this deal
 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:42.920
side says because if you want this deal
you'll have to what you just found out

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930
you'll have to what you just found out
 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.860
you'll have to what you just found out
is they've been pushed to the limit on

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870
is they've been pushed to the limit on
 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.500
is they've been pushed to the limit on
that issue as far as they'll go

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510
that issue as far as they'll go
 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:52.040
that issue as far as they'll go
and that paternal question is have I

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050
and that paternal question is have I
 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:53.660
and that paternal question is have I
gotten everything I could on that was on

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670
gotten everything I could on that was on
 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.170
gotten everything I could on that was on
the table that's a great way to find out

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180
the table that's a great way to find out
 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:58.400
the table that's a great way to find out
whether or not you've gotten everything

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410
whether or not you've gotten everything
 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:00.910

you could on that particular term
 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.740
you could on that particular term
because the other side most angry

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750
because the other side most angry
 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.410
because the other side most angry
response is because you have to which is

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420
response is because you have to which is
 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.740

terminating the deal it's not them

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390
terminating the deal it's not them
 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:15.080
terminating the deal it's not them
giving you any more of an ultimatum it's

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090
giving you any more of an ultimatum it's
 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.870
giving you any more of an ultimatum it's
them saying no I've got no more room to

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880
them saying no I've got no more room to
 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:21.110
them saying no I've got no more room to
give without the negotiations breaking

give without the negotiations breaking
 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.199
give without the negotiations breaking
off so given the other side the illusion

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209
off so given the other side the illusion
 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:28.280
off so given the other side the illusion
of control while signaling limits it's a

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290
of control while signaling limits it's a
 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.110
of control while signaling limits it's a
great way to stay in the conversation

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120
great way to stay in the conversation
 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:31.610
great way to stay in the conversation
