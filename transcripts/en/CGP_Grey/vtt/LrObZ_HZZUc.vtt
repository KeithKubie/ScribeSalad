# The (Secret) City of London -- Part 1

00:00:00.799 --> 00:00:04.939
The Great City of London, known for its historical
landmarks, modern skyscrapers, ancient markets

00:00:04.939 --> 00:00:09.270
and famous bridges. It's arguably the financial
capital of the world and home to over eleven

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:10.550
*thousand* people.

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:13.120
Wait, what? Eleven... thousand?

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:17.150
That's right: but the City of London is a
different place from London -- though London

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.839
is also known for its historical landmarks,
modern skyscrapers, ancient markets, famous

00:00:20.839 --> 00:00:24.429
bridges and is home to the government, royal
family and seven million people.

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:28.079
But, if you look map of London crafted by
a careful cartographer that map will have

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:32.250
a one-square mile hole near the middle -- it's
here where the City of London lives inside

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:33.750
of the city named London.

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.300
Despite these confusingly close names the
two Londons have separate city halls and elect

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:41.040
separate mayors, who collect separate taxes
to fund separate police who enforce separate

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:41.690
laws.

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:45.010
The Mayor of the City of London has a fancy
title 'The Right Honourable the Lord Mayor

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:48.920
of London' to match his fancy outfit. He also
gets to ride in a golden carriage and work

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.740
in a Guildhall while the mayor of London has
to wear a suit, ride a bike and work in an

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:53.640
office building.

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.800
The City of London also has its own flag and
its own crest which is awesome and makes London's

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.800
lack of either twice as sad.

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.579
To top it off the City of London gets to act
more like one of the countries in the UK than

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:08.350
just an oddly located city -- for uniquely
the corporation that runs the city of London

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:11.960
is older than the United Kingdom by several
hundred years.

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.229
So how did the UK end up with two Londons,
one inside of the other? Because: Romans.

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.080
2,000 years ago they came to Great Britain,
killed a bunch of druids, and founded a trading

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.729
post on the River Thames and named it Londonimium.
Being Romans they got to work doing what Romans

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:28.670
do: enforcing laws, increasing trade, building
temples, public baths, roads, bridges and

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:30.340
a wall to defend their work.

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.460
And it's this wall which is why the current
City of London exists -- for though the Romans

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:39.010
came and the Romans went and kingdoms rose
and kingdoms fell, the wall endured protecting

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:43.549
the city within. And The City, governing itself
and trading with the world, grew rich.

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:47.549
A thousand years after the Romans (yet still
a thousand years ago) when William the Conqueror

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.560
came to Great Britain to conqueror everything
and begin modern british history he found

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.570
the City of London, with its sturdy walls
more challenging to defeat than farmers on

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:56.720
open fields.

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.580
So he agreed to recognize the rights and privileges
City of Londoners were used to in return for

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.869
the them recognizing him as the new King.

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:06.549
Though after the negotiation, William quickly
built towers around the City of London which

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:10.319
were just as much about protecting William
from the locals within as defending against

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:11.950
the Vikings from without.

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:15.560
This started a thousand-year long tradition
whereby Monarchs always reconfirmed that 'yes'

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.410
the City of London is a special, unique place
best left to its own business, while simultaneously

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:21.319
distrusting it.

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:24.840
Many a monarch thought the City of London
was too powerful and rich. And one even built

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.420
a new Capital city nearby, named Westminster,
to compete with the City of London and hopefully,

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.780
suck power and wealth away from it. This was
the start of the second London.

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.630
As the centuries passed, Westminster grew
and merged with nearby towns eventually surrounding

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:41.630
the walled-in, and still separate City of
London. But, people began to call the whole

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:45.550
urban collection 'London' and the name became
official when Parliament joined towns together

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:48.200
under a single municipal government with a
mayor.

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:52.500
But, the mayor of London still doesn't have
power over the tiny City of London which has

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.390
rules and traditions like nowhere else in
the country and possibly the world.

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:59.879
For example, the ruling monarch doesn't just
enter the City of London on a whim, but instead

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:04.160
asks for permission from the Lord Mayor at
a ceremony. While it's not required by law,

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.910
the ceremony is, unusual to say the least.

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:10.489
The City of London also has a representative
in Parliament, The Remembrancer, whose job

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:12.690
it is to protects the City's special rights.

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:16.489
Because of this, laws passed by Parliament
sometimes don't apply to the City of London:

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:21.590
most notably voting reforms, which we'll discuss
next time. But if you're curious, unlike anywhere

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:26.680
else in the UK elections in the City of London
involve Medieval Guilds and modern companies.

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:31.060
Finally, the City of London also owns and
operates land and buildings far outside its

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.129
border, making it quite wealthy.

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:36.849
Once you start looking for The City's Crest
you'll find it in lots of places, but most

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:41.580
notably on Tower Bridge which, while being
in London is operated by City of London,

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:45.599
These crests everywhere when combined with
the City of London's age and wealth and quazi-independent

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:49.849
status make it an irresistible temptation
for conspiracy nuts. Add in the oldest Masonic

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:53.430
temple and it's not long before the crazy
part of the Internet yelling about secret

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:57.459
societies controlling the world via the finance
industry from inside the City-state of London.

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:01.230
(And don't forget the reptilian alien Queen
who's really behind it all.)

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:05.010
But conspiracy theories aside, the City of
London is not an independent nation like the

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:08.890
Vatican is, no matter how much you might read
it on the Internet, rather it's a unique place

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:12.800
in the United Kingdom with a long and complicated
history.

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:17.459
The wall that began all this 2,000 years ago
is now mostly gone -- so the border between

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:21.519
London and its secret inner city isn't so
obvious. Though, next time you're in London,

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:25.669
if you come across a small dragon on the street,
he still guards the entrance to the city in

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:27.520
a city in a country in a country.
