HELEN SWORD: Well,
thank you, Amy and Judy,

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:09.150
for organizing this.

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.430
And thank you, Steve and
Elizabeth, for taking part.

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:15.990
Judy mentioned sort
of a formative moment

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.290
as a graduate student.

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:19.580
And I'll start with one of mine.

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:21.680
When I was doing
my PhD at Princeton

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.750
in comparative literature,
I remember a moment

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:30.030
at the end of my first year
when somebody in my department

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:34.370
was in his second year and was
just taking his general exams,

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:35.940
PhD qualifying exams.

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.130
And so we all clustered
around him afterwards.

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:40.980
And we said, how'd it go?

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:41.890
How'd it go?

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:43.940
And he said, oh, I think
it went really well.

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.070
I've just spent the last hour
writing about the slippage

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.190
of the signifier.

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:54.150
And I thought, I don't
even know what that means.

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:57.220
But of course, by a year
later when I took my exams,

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:59.460
I had made damn sure that
I knew what it meant.

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.420
And also, I'm pretty
sure that I managed

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:04.660
to get that phrase into my exam,
because I could tell that it

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:07.340
sounded really impressive.

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.270
And so that was one of those
moments when I internalized

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.320
this idea that being
an academic writer

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.977
was primarily about
impressing other academics

00:01:15.977 --> 00:01:16.810
with your erudition.

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:21.590
I've come to believe
that it is or should

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:24.640
be about communicating
effectively,

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.680
whether with colleagues or with
people outside of the academy.

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.410
And I think learning to make
that distinction was also

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:34.330
an important part
of my education.

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:37.770
I went on from there, then, to
teach in an English department

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:38.710
for about 10 years.

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:42.080
I wrote a couple of books
of literary criticism.

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.610
I prided myself that
they were well-written.

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:47.750
I thought of myself
as a good writer.

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:52.590
And I think I did manage
to avoid the worst

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.950
temptations of jargon that
people in that discipline

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.490
in particular can fall into.

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.307
And yet, I would go to
academic conferences,

00:02:03.307 --> 00:02:05.390
and people would come up
and say, loved your book.

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:06.190
And that was great.

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:08.070
There was a real
sense of communicating

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.979
with the colleagues.

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:11.039
But I would give a
copy to my mother.

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.940
And she'd flip through
the first chapter.

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.490
And she'd say, my, you
know a lot of big words.

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.090
So the moment for
me when I really

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.220
started to think about academic
writing more broadly outside

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.280
of my discipline came maybe
seven or eight years ago,

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:31.940
when I shifted into working in
faculty development and higher

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:33.630
education research.

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:37.540
And so I was charged with
developing and teaching

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.580
on a program that was for
faculty at my university who

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.470
wanted to become more
research-informed teachers.

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:49.580
So I naturally went out, trying
to find readings for them.

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:52.160
I wanted to find people
working in higher education

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:53.950
research who could
kind of summarize

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:55.880
the best of that
research so that people

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:59.610
could benefit from that
research in their own teaching.

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:03.160
Found plenty of good
books that did that,

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.380
and I could pull chapters
out of those books.

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:07.820
And I think there's a
lesson there that the bar is

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:10.990
higher with book publishing.

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:13.760
You go through a
lot more-- you have

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.070
to step through
a lot more gates.

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:20.050
But when I looked in the top
international higher education

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:23.720
research journals, what I found
were a whole bunch of articles

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:30.920
that, by and large, were,
at best, wooden and dry,

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:38.340
at worst, spongy and soggy,
and that really seemed

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:39.780
to be communicating--
they seemed

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:42.140
to be higher education
researchers trying

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:44.060
to impress other
higher education

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:48.200
researchers with their jargon,
and with their language,

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:50.940
and with their methodology.

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:53.402
And most of these
articles I couldn't use.

00:03:53.402 --> 00:03:55.360
At first, I thought maybe
it was just because I

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.780
came from literary studies.

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:00.330
And maybe it was just me.

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:04.120
So I did distribute a few
of these to my colleagues.

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:08.750
So these would be people from
law, population health, music,

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:09.840
engineering.

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.030
And they pretty much
all said, no, we

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:13.860
don't want to read this stuff.

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:15.310
Don't understand it.

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:18.180
They're taking 20 pages to
say something they could

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:21.630
say in five pages, et cetera.

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:25.000
And that was when I started to
think there's something wrong

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.610
here if people who are doing
research on higher education

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:34.430
teaching and learning
cannot-- are either not able

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:38.530
to or can't be bothered to
communicate that research

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:41.630
to other people working in
higher education teaching

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:45.760
and learning-- so educated
people with PhDs--

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:48.670
then what are
those articles for?

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:49.790
What are they doing?

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:51.350
So at that point,
I decided to do

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:55.120
a little bit of empirical
research of my own.

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:57.960
I sent out an email
basically to everybody

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:00.880
I knew and asked them to send
it on to everybody they knew.

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:02.310
And I asked a
couple of questions.

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:07.830
I asked, what is your definition
of stylish academic writing?

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:11.660
And it isn't intentionally
oxymoronic and slightly

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:12.940
provocative phrase.

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:14.960
Not everybody likes
the word stylish.

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:16.600
If that doesn't
ring your bell, you

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:19.530
can replace it with
engaging, or even just

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:21.660
effective academic writing.

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:24.340
So if you ask yourself
the same questions,

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:27.710
think of who are the
writers in your field

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:31.630
who really engage you and who,
when you read their writing,

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:34.460
you think, I would like
to write like that.

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:37.350
And then think about
what is it that they do?

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:40.050
What are the characteristics
of their writing?

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:42.510
That is stylish
academic writing.

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:46.390
So I got back responses
from more than 70 people

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:49.290
from around the world and
across the disciplines.

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:51.460
And what I found
astonishing was how,

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:54.450
despite the disciplinary
differences, how consistent

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:56.220
their responses were.

00:05:56.220 --> 00:06:00.020
They pretty much all said,
in one way or another,

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:03.140
that they value people
who take complex ideas

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:08.220
and communicate them clearly,
or if not clearly-- because

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:11.580
not every discipline values
clarity as much as others.

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:14.110
Some actually value opacity.

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:16.510
But still, there is the
idea that they communicate

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:19.280
complex ideas in a
way that illuminates

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:21.370
those ideas for their reader.

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:23.670
They talked about the
importance of communication.

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:28.320
They would say, I like
authors who tell a story.

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:31.450
I like authors who
use lots of examples

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:34.700
to illustrate whatever it
is they're talking about.

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:37.030
And this came whether, it
was people in the science,

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:40.180
or humanities, social sciences.

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:44.210
And so from that list and
also from looking at examples

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:47.300
of some of the writers that
they particularly recommended,

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:50.220
I made a kind of 10
point, you could call it

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:54.320
a grading rubric, 10 things that
the stylish academic writers

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:55.879
usually do.

00:06:55.879 --> 00:06:57.420
So there are things
like they usually

00:06:57.420 --> 00:07:00.320
have an engaging title, a
title that kind of says,

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:01.300
come read me.

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:03.490
I've gone to some
work with this.

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:05.750
They usually have
an opening paragraph

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:07.060
that really pulls you in.

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:10.260
They usually use lots
and lots of examples.

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:13.540
They usually do have a sense
of a story they're telling.

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:17.880
They always have
well-crafted sentences.

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:21.980
So you might prefer
concision in your writing.

00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:28.610
Or you might prefer really
long, complex syntax.

00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:31.230
But either way,
the stylish writers

00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:33.900
are the ones who have
really taken the time

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:36.804
to make those
sentences well-crafted.

00:07:36.804 --> 00:07:38.220
Pretty much everybody
in this room

00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:40.730
would probably agree
on those things.

00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:42.800
So I took this 10 point list.

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:45.200
And then I checked
it against a number

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:47.990
of the stylish academic writers
who had been recommended.

00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:49.520
Steve was on the list.

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:52.670
And I did my best to find, not
just books by these people,

00:07:52.670 --> 00:07:56.000
but articles where possible,
so that I wouldn't be comparing

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.212
apples with oranges, rated these
writers on the 10 point scale.

00:08:00.212 --> 00:08:01.670
And most of them
came out-- I think

00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:04.510
the average score for 10
people across the disciplines

00:08:04.510 --> 00:08:08.340
was about 9.1, which isn't
too surprising, because I'd

00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:10.730
constructed the rubric
based on what they do.

00:08:10.730 --> 00:08:12.400
But it was just
to make the point

00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:17.460
that it is possible to
write academic articles that

00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:22.040
do these things and to publish
them in a range of journals.

00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:26.440
Then I looked at 100
articles from basically

00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:30.430
the six highest rated higher
education research journals.

00:08:30.430 --> 00:08:35.750
And I rated them on the
same 10 point scale.

00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:40.530
Anyone want to take a guess
that at average score out of 10

00:08:40.530 --> 00:08:42.400
possible?

00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:43.470
I heard a four.

00:08:43.470 --> 00:08:45.440
I saw three.

00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:48.280
2.5-- you were all optimists.

00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:51.220
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:54.890
The mean score was 1.1.

00:08:54.890 --> 00:08:56.830
The median score was zero.

00:08:56.830 --> 00:09:03.370
More than half did none
of these 10 things.

00:09:03.370 --> 00:09:07.650
And again, you just have to
look at that and say, why?

00:09:07.650 --> 00:09:08.760
What is going on here?

00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:11.550
Why would the authors of
these journal articles

00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:14.720
not do any of the
things that we all

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:18.450
know you can do to make
your work more engaging

00:09:18.450 --> 00:09:19.960
and readable?

00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:22.200
And I think the reason
is, well, there are

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:24.380
various institutional reasons.

00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:28.940
But they kind of boil down
to convention and fear,

00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:30.630
people actually
thinking that they

00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:33.630
have to write that way in
order to get published.

00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:36.190
So I actually wrote an article
based on that research ,

00:09:36.190 --> 00:09:38.920
got it published
in the top journal,

00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:42.410
Studies in Higher Education,
to prove the point that

00:09:42.410 --> 00:09:46.350
the editors actually are looking
for things that are engaging,

00:09:46.350 --> 00:09:48.760
as long as the research
has to be there.

00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:52.400
There can't be empty style
without the substance.

00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:54.990
At that point, I decided
to broaden my research

00:09:54.990 --> 00:09:58.110
and look at academic writing
across the disciplines, which

00:09:58.110 --> 00:10:00.960
has been just
absolutely fascinating.

00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:03.310
I stopped using
the grading rubric,

00:10:03.310 --> 00:10:05.410
because I didn't want to
be pitting-- you know,

00:10:05.410 --> 00:10:06.670
it's not fair.

00:10:06.670 --> 00:10:08.440
And in some
disciplines, if you're

00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:10.820
looking at a medical journal,
where people are writing

00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:14.330
a seven page, very
formulaic [INAUDIBLE]

00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:17.960
of a five year research project.

00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:21.814
You're not expecting the
snazzy introduction and things.

00:10:21.814 --> 00:10:24.230
You have readers who want to
come in and just sort of mine

00:10:24.230 --> 00:10:26.040
it for the facts.

00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:28.460
But those same writers
in the sciences

00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:31.370
also have the moments when
they need to communicate with,

00:10:31.370 --> 00:10:33.770
for instance, the tenure
and promotion committees

00:10:33.770 --> 00:10:35.860
or the grant writing
committees, when

00:10:35.860 --> 00:10:39.530
actually having those more
stylish strategies would

00:10:39.530 --> 00:10:42.390
be very useful for them,
the ones that engage

00:10:42.390 --> 00:10:44.840
and persuade people.

00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:45.830
So I started looking.

00:10:45.830 --> 00:10:48.790
I looked at 1,000
articles, 100 each

00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:51.560
from 10 different disciplines
across the sciences,

00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:54.430
the social sciences, and
the arts and humanities

00:10:54.430 --> 00:10:56.810
and found that while,
in most disciplines,

00:10:56.810 --> 00:11:00.690
things aren't quite as dire as
they are in higher education,

00:11:00.690 --> 00:11:07.050
still a strikingly high number
of disciplines-- of academics

00:11:07.050 --> 00:11:09.610
in pretty much all
disciplines are very much

00:11:09.610 --> 00:11:14.320
ruled by convention, which I
find interesting for academics.

00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:16.130
Because I think of
being an academic

00:11:16.130 --> 00:11:19.040
as being about pushing the
boundaries of knowledge.

00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:20.820
And yet, a lot of
the training that we

00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:24.510
do with our graduate students
is about disciplining them,

00:11:24.510 --> 00:11:25.490
fitting them within.

00:11:25.490 --> 00:11:29.100
And so there's a real
kind of difficulty there.

00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:32.790
So by the time I'd
done that research,

00:11:32.790 --> 00:11:38.000
I also looked at well over
probably 150 books and articles

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.470
by people who had been
recommended to me by colleagues

00:11:40.470 --> 00:11:44.470
in their own fields as
stylish academic writers.

00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:48.620
And I decided in the book not
to focus on the negative side,

00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:50.190
the bad side.

00:11:50.190 --> 00:11:53.040
Turns out, I'm very good at
doing these really snarky

00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:55.200
close readings of
really bad sentences,

00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:56.930
and I quite enjoy doing it.

00:11:56.930 --> 00:11:59.410
But it makes people
feel bad, you know.

00:11:59.410 --> 00:12:01.170
And if you want
to change things,

00:12:01.170 --> 00:12:02.890
you don't do it by
criticizing people.

00:12:02.890 --> 00:12:04.510
You do it by inspiring them.

00:12:04.510 --> 00:12:07.680
So I tried to find the
inspiring examples.

00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:11.580
And the book is full of these
little spotlights on style,

00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:13.380
where I've taken
particular writers

00:12:13.380 --> 00:12:16.910
and done close readings of
their works, their sentences

00:12:16.910 --> 00:12:19.920
and paragraphs, to
try to demystify

00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:22.610
what stylish writing is.

00:12:22.610 --> 00:12:25.490
Yes, some people
are more talented

00:12:25.490 --> 00:12:28.070
and more skillful at
writing than others.

00:12:28.070 --> 00:12:30.510
But they are all
using techniques

00:12:30.510 --> 00:12:32.310
that anybody can learn.

00:12:32.310 --> 00:12:34.360
And so I tried to
really break down

00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:38.030
what they were doing into
the specific techniques

00:12:38.030 --> 00:12:40.330
that they use.

00:12:40.330 --> 00:12:41.970
At the beginning of
the book, I talked

00:12:41.970 --> 00:12:45.270
about three characteristics
of stylish writing

00:12:45.270 --> 00:12:48.282
that I think go across
the board, no matter

00:12:48.282 --> 00:12:49.115
what the discipline.

00:12:49.115 --> 00:12:51.380
So style can vary.

00:12:51.380 --> 00:12:55.190
We can all have different
stylistic preferences.

00:12:55.190 --> 00:13:01.460
But stylish academic writers, I
think, always, always, always,

00:13:01.460 --> 00:13:03.970
are concerned with
communication.

00:13:03.970 --> 00:13:07.790
So that's one of
the characteristics.

00:13:07.790 --> 00:13:11.600
Another is that I think they
are always concerned with craft.

00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:13.790
As I've already said, it
could be a short sentence,

00:13:13.790 --> 00:13:16.870
a long one, but as long as
it's a well-crafted sentence.

00:13:16.870 --> 00:13:19.420
And the point there
is that the author

00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:23.587
is doing the work, not expecting
the reader to do the work.

00:13:23.587 --> 00:13:25.670
And think about that when
you're reading something

00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:27.370
where you're really
plowing through it

00:13:27.370 --> 00:13:28.540
and trying to figure it out.

00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:30.920
It's probably because the
author hasn't actually

00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:34.260
taken the time to work it
and work it and work it.

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:37.970
This may seem really obvious
to most of you sitting here,

00:13:37.970 --> 00:13:41.560
but I don't think it's obvious
always to our students.

00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:45.200
I've heard a lot of
graduate students say,

00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:46.780
you know, I'm not
a very good writer.

00:13:46.780 --> 00:13:48.040
And it's so frustrating.

00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:50.820
It's the same story of
getting all the red pen back.

00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:52.190
And this is a bad thing.

00:13:52.190 --> 00:13:57.200
My supervisor is a
really good writer.

00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:59.730
And then I write these
things, and it's just mush.

00:13:59.730 --> 00:14:02.330
And I have to work on it and
work on it and work on it

00:14:02.330 --> 00:14:03.370
to make it any better.

00:14:03.370 --> 00:14:04.280
And it's so hard.

00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:05.560
And it's so frustrating.

00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:07.860
And I'm just not
really very good.

00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:10.070
Then you go, and you
talk to the supervisor.

00:14:10.070 --> 00:14:13.310
And this is some of the research
I'm doing now, interviewing

00:14:13.310 --> 00:14:14.860
academics about their writing.

00:14:14.860 --> 00:14:18.080
And they'll say, oh, when
I write the first draft,

00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:18.950
it's just mush.

00:14:18.950 --> 00:14:20.174
It's a big mess.

00:14:20.174 --> 00:14:22.590
But then I work on it, and I
work on it, and I work on it.

00:14:22.590 --> 00:14:23.993
And I craft it.

00:14:23.993 --> 00:14:26.850
And I'm an artisan of words.

00:14:26.850 --> 00:14:27.600
And I work on it.

00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:30.310
And it's hard, but
it's so satisfying,

00:14:30.310 --> 00:14:33.240
getting it to where it gets
better and better and better.

00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:36.780
Right, same story from
those two different people.

00:14:36.780 --> 00:14:39.720
But one of them is seeing it
as this horrible frustration,

00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:41.920
because they don't understand
that that's actually

00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:46.670
what it takes to write
the stylish prose.

00:14:46.670 --> 00:14:52.130
And so I've come to believe that
one of the qualities of-- one

00:14:52.130 --> 00:14:55.140
of the sort of human qualities
that goes with stylish writing

00:14:55.140 --> 00:14:57.400
is a pleasure in the craft.

00:14:57.400 --> 00:15:00.000
Until you acquire that
pleasure in the craft,

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.410
you won't necessarily want
to put in the hard yards

00:15:02.410 --> 00:15:03.680
to get there.

00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:07.130
So communication
craft, and the third C

00:15:07.130 --> 00:15:09.190
that I write about
in the introduction

00:15:09.190 --> 00:15:13.800
is creativity, by which
I don't mean necessarily

00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:17.570
that academics are or should
be bringing techniques

00:15:17.570 --> 00:15:20.550
from creative writing into
their academic writing,

00:15:20.550 --> 00:15:22.550
although some
people do that very

00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:24.640
deliberately and effectively.

00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:27.560
I mean that what I noticed
amongst the stylish writers I

00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:31.060
looked at is that
they don't adhere

00:15:31.060 --> 00:15:34.440
to convention if the
convention doesn't suit them.

00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:37.410
And they are constantly
pulling in ideas

00:15:37.410 --> 00:15:38.900
from other disciplines.

00:15:38.900 --> 00:15:41.880
Again, if you think of the
top people in your own field,

00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:45.140
think of what they do,
either stylistically

00:15:45.140 --> 00:15:47.660
or in terms of the research.

00:15:47.660 --> 00:15:49.530
And you'll find
that most of them

00:15:49.530 --> 00:15:52.470
are quite
intradisciplinary thinkers.

00:15:52.470 --> 00:15:53.810
I've seen this again and again.

00:15:53.810 --> 00:15:55.490
They're reading widely.

00:15:55.490 --> 00:15:57.990
They're bringing in ideas
from outside the discipline.

00:15:57.990 --> 00:16:01.700
And that's precisely how they're
pushing the discipline forward.

00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:05.330
So for teaching our students
that being an academic

00:16:05.330 --> 00:16:07.900
is about adhering to
convention, we're actually

00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:13.110
teaching them not to be in
that kind of top tier, I think.

00:16:13.110 --> 00:16:16.960
By the time I finished the book,
I'd come up with three more

00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:18.220
C's.

00:16:18.220 --> 00:16:21.060
Helps me remember
them-- good mnemonic.

00:16:21.060 --> 00:16:24.060
And so these were things that
I wasn't necessarily looking

00:16:24.060 --> 00:16:25.000
for at the beginning.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.060
But by the time I had finished,
I had really noticed them.

00:16:28.060 --> 00:16:30.000
One of them is actually
more a technique

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.720
than an overall principle,
which is concreteness.

00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:36.700
I saw this again and again,
whether in the science writing

00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:39.670
or the humanities or
anywhere in between,

00:16:39.670 --> 00:16:44.730
that the writers that most
of us find the most engaging

00:16:44.730 --> 00:16:50.480
are the ones who use concrete
language and concrete examples,

00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:53.980
particularly when they're
talking about abstract ideas.

00:16:53.980 --> 00:16:57.010
Now, being an academic
is all about abstraction.

00:16:57.010 --> 00:16:58.100
That's the whole point.

00:16:58.100 --> 00:17:01.710
The definition of research is
the advancement of knowledge

00:17:01.710 --> 00:17:05.089
or the creation of new
generalizable knowledge.

00:17:05.089 --> 00:17:10.160
That act of generalizing is, in
essence, an act of abstraction.

00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:13.970
So it's not a matter of
saying you won't be abstract.

00:17:13.970 --> 00:17:17.290
It's a matter of communicating
those abstract ideas

00:17:17.290 --> 00:17:19.420
through concrete language.

00:17:19.420 --> 00:17:22.810
And I just, I notice
it again and again.

00:17:22.810 --> 00:17:25.210
Sometimes it's just
through the use,

00:17:25.210 --> 00:17:26.910
the choice of verbs and nouns.

00:17:26.910 --> 00:17:30.040
And that's why we have so
much language in academe.

00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:33.230
Some of it kind of turns into
dead metaphors at some point.

00:17:33.230 --> 00:17:36.570
But that's why we talk
about exploring ideas

00:17:36.570 --> 00:17:40.310
and about constructing
theoretical frameworks.

00:17:40.310 --> 00:17:42.770
Those are concrete
terms that we're

00:17:42.770 --> 00:17:47.340
using to just kind of give us
something we can visualize.

00:17:47.340 --> 00:17:50.840
And my favorite example
of how this works

00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:53.550
comes, not from a piece
of academic writing,

00:17:53.550 --> 00:17:55.844
although you could find
many examples of it again.

00:17:55.844 --> 00:17:58.260
I'm sure you think about this,
Steve, when you're writing.

00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:00.970
Because you certainly do it.

00:18:00.970 --> 00:18:02.950
But it's from a
political speech.

00:18:02.950 --> 00:18:05.880
Martin Luther King's
"I Have a Dream" speech

00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:08.250
is about abstract
concepts, right?

00:18:08.250 --> 00:18:13.120
It's about freedom and
injustice and all these things.

00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:15.630
But the way that he
communicates those ideas

00:18:15.630 --> 00:18:18.070
is relentlessly concrete.

00:18:18.070 --> 00:18:20.570
So he'll say, "I
have a dream that one

00:18:20.570 --> 00:18:24.720
day in the red hills of Georgia,
the sons of former slaves

00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:27.080
and the sons of
former slave owners

00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:29.360
will be able to
sit down together

00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:32.590
at the table of brotherhood."

00:18:32.590 --> 00:18:35.090
He ends with the abstract noun.

00:18:35.090 --> 00:18:37.600
But by the time he gets
you to the brotherhood,

00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:42.120
he's taken you to a place,
the red hills of Georgia,

00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:43.370
giving you this visual.

00:18:43.370 --> 00:18:46.250
He's given you these people,
the sons of the slaves

00:18:46.250 --> 00:18:48.250
and the sons of
the slave owners.

00:18:48.250 --> 00:18:49.720
He's given you an action.

00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:53.370
They sit down
together at a place,

00:18:53.370 --> 00:18:57.330
at the table of brotherhood.

00:18:57.330 --> 00:19:01.110
"I have a dream that my four
little children will one day

00:19:01.110 --> 00:19:04.970
be able to be judged, not
by the color of their skin,

00:19:04.970 --> 00:19:07.240
but by the content
of their character."

00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:09.160
Same thing-- he gives
you the particulars.

00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:11.410
He gives you the visual image.

00:19:11.410 --> 00:19:13.400
And then he gives
the abstraction,

00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:15.371
the content of your character.

00:19:15.371 --> 00:19:17.870
So if this is something that
you don't normally think about,

00:19:17.870 --> 00:19:20.580
and I'm sure some of
you do, but if it's not

00:19:20.580 --> 00:19:22.640
something you've thought
about much before,

00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:24.620
pay attention to it
when you're reading

00:19:24.620 --> 00:19:26.375
or when you're listening.

00:19:26.375 --> 00:19:34.464
I particularly like the genre
of the school graduation speech.

00:19:34.464 --> 00:19:35.880
You know, so the
principal will be

00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:39.165
talking about striving for
the attainment of excellence

00:19:39.165 --> 00:19:40.290
and all this sort of thing.

00:19:40.290 --> 00:19:42.440
And everybody is
kind of nodding off.

00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:46.170
And then at some point, they'll
go, let me tell you a story.

00:19:46.170 --> 00:19:49.790
And they tell you a story
of a former student who

00:19:49.790 --> 00:19:51.760
has attained excellence.

00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:54.910
And suddenly, you perk up
again, because you're back

00:19:54.910 --> 00:19:56.040
in the concrete world.

00:19:56.040 --> 00:19:59.150
You're in the world of
bodies that we live in.

00:19:59.150 --> 00:20:01.970
So concreteness-- that
was, as a technique,

00:20:01.970 --> 00:20:04.450
that would be, for
me, the number one

00:20:04.450 --> 00:20:06.530
that really came
out of that book.

00:20:06.530 --> 00:20:08.130
Telling stories goes with that.

00:20:08.130 --> 00:20:11.550
But that's of forming, of
making things concrete.

00:20:11.550 --> 00:20:16.820
Another of the sort of
overall principles is choice.

00:20:16.820 --> 00:20:19.030
And what I found
from my research

00:20:19.030 --> 00:20:23.020
is that in most disciplines,
at any given time,

00:20:23.020 --> 00:20:27.120
you actually have
choices about style.

00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:32.140
And again, I hear a lot
of early career academics,

00:20:32.140 --> 00:20:35.080
grad students, say that
they can't do things

00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:37.950
because they're not allowed to.

00:20:37.950 --> 00:20:39.780
So a classic example
of that that I

00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:43.710
investigated a bit in the
book is pronoun usage, right?

00:20:43.710 --> 00:20:48.500
Can you or can you not use
first person pronouns, I and we?

00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:50.540
The number of times
people have said

00:20:50.540 --> 00:20:52.510
to me, particularly
social scientists,

00:20:52.510 --> 00:20:56.980
we're not allowed to use the
first person, and then I go

00:20:56.980 --> 00:20:59.510
and I look at the journals
in their discipline.

00:20:59.510 --> 00:21:02.370
And it may not be conventional
to use the first person,

00:21:02.370 --> 00:21:04.800
but there will always be one
article where somebody does,

00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:07.910
one out of 10 or
something like that.

00:21:07.910 --> 00:21:09.490
The social scientists
will say, well,

00:21:09.490 --> 00:21:11.420
we're not allowed to
use the first person,

00:21:11.420 --> 00:21:14.110
because we have to
sound like scientists.

00:21:14.110 --> 00:21:16.440
I looked at three
scientific disciplines.

00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:20.380
I looked at evolutionary
biology, computer science,

00:21:20.380 --> 00:21:21.570
and medicine.

00:21:21.570 --> 00:21:25.350
And I found that in all of
them, 80% or more of the authors

00:21:25.350 --> 00:21:27.390
used we.

00:21:27.390 --> 00:21:30.090
And all of the style
guides in every discipline

00:21:30.090 --> 00:21:33.310
say, go ahead and use
first person pronouns.

00:21:33.310 --> 00:21:35.140
I couldn't find a
single one, including

00:21:35.140 --> 00:21:37.900
APA, used by most people
in social sciences,

00:21:37.900 --> 00:21:42.260
that says, use the passive voice
and don't include yourself.

00:21:42.260 --> 00:21:45.830
And yet, it's persisted
as this kind of myth.

00:21:45.830 --> 00:21:47.890
The most surprising
finding for me

00:21:47.890 --> 00:21:50.900
was that, of the 10
disciplines I looked at,

00:21:50.900 --> 00:21:55.020
the one where first person
pronouns were used least

00:21:55.020 --> 00:21:56.550
was not in the sciences.

00:21:56.550 --> 00:21:58.240
It wasn't in the
social sciences.

00:21:58.240 --> 00:22:00.290
It was in history.

00:22:00.290 --> 00:22:04.140
So in history, I found that
of the sample I looked at,

00:22:04.140 --> 00:22:07.970
100 articles, about
40% used first person

00:22:07.970 --> 00:22:10.540
pronouns and about 60% did not.

00:22:10.540 --> 00:22:15.190
In contrast to literary
studies, a neighboring genre,

00:22:15.190 --> 00:22:17.200
very similar in many
ways-- and there

00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:20.589
is something like 98% used
first person pronouns.

00:22:20.589 --> 00:22:22.630
So I went, and I talked
to the history department

00:22:22.630 --> 00:22:23.650
at my university.

00:22:23.650 --> 00:22:25.610
And I showed them
these statistics.

00:22:25.610 --> 00:22:27.330
And I said, explain this to me.

00:22:27.330 --> 00:22:31.990
Why don't you use-- you write
in a very personal style,

00:22:31.990 --> 00:22:32.840
generally.

00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:35.480
It's not-- most historians
are not pretending

00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:37.680
to be completely objective.

00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:39.872
But they're doing that
through other means,

00:22:39.872 --> 00:22:41.080
not through the first person.

00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:44.710
And so the chair of the
department stuck up his hand.

00:22:44.710 --> 00:22:48.430
And he said, well, I don't
use first person pronouns

00:22:48.430 --> 00:22:51.220
because Professor
So-and-So at Oxford

00:22:51.220 --> 00:22:54.410
told me in 1978 that
I must never do so.

00:22:54.410 --> 00:22:59.010
And he had never since then
actually questioned that.

00:22:59.010 --> 00:23:03.340
Now, if 60% are not using
personal pronouns and 40% are,

00:23:03.340 --> 00:23:05.630
that suggests to me that
if you're a historian,

00:23:05.630 --> 00:23:07.820
you have a choice.

00:23:07.820 --> 00:23:09.110
It is your choice.

00:23:09.110 --> 00:23:13.430
It is not the convention that
is choosing things for you.

00:23:13.430 --> 00:23:16.000
So I would encourage
academics, and particularly

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:21.460
again early career academics
who are learning the genres,

00:23:21.460 --> 00:23:24.120
to learn them in terms
of choices they make,

00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:26.180
rather than in
terms of conventions

00:23:26.180 --> 00:23:27.790
they have to follow.

00:23:27.790 --> 00:23:31.860
But that brings me to the
final C, which is courage.

00:23:31.860 --> 00:23:36.220
I think it takes courage to
be a stylish academic writer,

00:23:36.220 --> 00:23:39.990
to push on that oxymoron.

00:23:39.990 --> 00:23:42.920
And it can be difficult to
be courageous, particularly

00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:44.710
if you're early in your career.

00:23:44.710 --> 00:23:46.640
So another one of
the stories I hear

00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:51.230
a lot from the graduate students
and pre-tenured academics

00:23:51.230 --> 00:23:55.150
is, well, so-and-so who's a
really great writer-- Steve

00:23:55.150 --> 00:23:57.490
Pinker, yeah, he writes
in a more personal style.

00:23:57.490 --> 00:23:59.530
But he's allowed to,
because he's famous.

00:23:59.530 --> 00:24:01.840
And he's got tenure
and all this.

00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:04.100
So I've been interviewing.

00:24:04.100 --> 00:24:05.780
The project I'm doing
now, I've kind of

00:24:05.780 --> 00:24:08.720
shifted from looking
at academic style

00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:12.050
to talking to the people
who write the books.

00:24:12.050 --> 00:24:14.170
So I'm looking at people.

00:24:14.170 --> 00:24:16.510
And by the time I
finish this trip,

00:24:16.510 --> 00:24:20.630
I will have interviewed more
than 100 academics from all

00:24:20.630 --> 00:24:23.910
across the disciplines and from
about 15 different countries,

00:24:23.910 --> 00:24:27.020
all people who have been
recommended by colleagues, not

00:24:27.020 --> 00:24:30.240
necessarily as stylish
writers, just as people

00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:33.260
who are interesting writers
or interested in writing

00:24:33.260 --> 00:24:37.930
or seem to just be able
to be productive writers

00:24:37.930 --> 00:24:40.961
and also to raise a family,
or have a normal life,

00:24:40.961 --> 00:24:41.460
or whatever.

00:24:41.460 --> 00:24:43.640
So I'm just talking to
them and asking them

00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:45.850
lots of questions
about how they learned

00:24:45.850 --> 00:24:47.880
to write, what their
daily habits are,

00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:49.410
what their emotions are.

00:24:49.410 --> 00:24:51.970
And then I've been asking
some of the same questions

00:24:51.970 --> 00:24:54.130
on a questionnaire, too.

00:24:54.130 --> 00:24:56.330
By the end, I'll have
about 1,000 people

00:24:56.330 --> 00:24:59.390
who will have-- so
academics from grad students

00:24:59.390 --> 00:25:01.510
through to emeriti
professors who will

00:25:01.510 --> 00:25:03.620
have answered those questions.

00:25:03.620 --> 00:25:07.130
And one of the things that
I've been asking particularly

00:25:07.130 --> 00:25:10.590
the successful, the
well-known writers is,

00:25:10.590 --> 00:25:13.890
is this true that you
waited until after you

00:25:13.890 --> 00:25:18.940
had tenure to start kind of
pushing the envelope on style?

00:25:18.940 --> 00:25:21.260
So I interviewed
Douglas Hofstadter,

00:25:21.260 --> 00:25:23.080
the author of
Godel, Escher, Bach,

00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:25.320
which he started writing
when he was 28 years old.

00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:27.580
He won the Pulitzer
Prize for it.

00:25:27.580 --> 00:25:30.670
And it made his academic career.

00:25:30.670 --> 00:25:34.270
And he, of course, said,
this is complete nonsense.

00:25:34.270 --> 00:25:37.230
I made my academic career
by having written a book

00:25:37.230 --> 00:25:42.080
that was unusual and that didn't
adhere to any academic genre.

00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:44.550
So I do hear the
stories of people

00:25:44.550 --> 00:25:46.290
who submit things to journals.

00:25:46.290 --> 00:25:47.870
And they get pushed back.

00:25:47.870 --> 00:25:50.440
They get told to chop out
all the interesting bits,

00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:52.730
or to take out the first
person, or whatever.

00:25:52.730 --> 00:25:55.430
But I've also heard a
lot of wonderful stories

00:25:55.430 --> 00:25:59.730
of resistance, of going back
to the editor and negotiating,

00:25:59.730 --> 00:26:02.040
or of sending the paper
to another journal

00:26:02.040 --> 00:26:06.210
and then winning the
prize for the best article

00:26:06.210 --> 00:26:08.820
for doing precisely the things
that somebody else told them

00:26:08.820 --> 00:26:09.770
they couldn't do.

00:26:09.770 --> 00:26:11.680
That takes confidence.

00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:13.620
That takes courage.

00:26:13.620 --> 00:26:16.630
But I think it's something that
it's worth it for all of us

00:26:16.630 --> 00:26:20.740
to push on ourselves, but
in particular, to encourage

00:26:20.740 --> 00:26:23.880
our students to do,
so to encourage them

00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:27.040
to be the courageous
writers, rather than

00:26:27.040 --> 00:26:30.870
the frightened,
conventional ones.

00:26:30.870 --> 00:26:34.870
So I'll end there and see
what these two have to say.

00:26:34.870 --> 00:26:37.920
[APPLAUSE]
