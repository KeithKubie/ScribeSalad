00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:54.190
he's an artist and educator
exploring the many boundaries

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:56.660
between science,

and backgrounds to do new

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.850
and interesting things with
our collections of data.

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:37.140
In his time with us Jer
has certainly done this,

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.480
he has wrangled our mark
records and made beautiful

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:43.500
and thoughtful entry ways
into our collections,

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.940
he's traversed all of our
tunnels and made friends

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:49.800
with people he's come across
and he's exposed the vastness

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.150
and smallness in
this institution.

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:55.400
He's applied his talents to
translating the intangibles

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.300
of the Library of Congress to
an audience that may not know

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:02.240
that much about us and this
podcast is a get example of that

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.870

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:48.260
of you new listeners let me
take a minute to catch up.

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.490
My name is Jer Thorp, I'm
an artist and a teacher

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:53.460
and a writer from Brooklyn, last
year the folks at the Library

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:55.920
of Congress asked me to come
here and spend six months

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:58.140
as the Innovator
in residence, well,

00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:00.920
this invitation was exciting and
nebulous enough that I jumped

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:03.550
at the opportunity and since
October I've been wondering

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:05.780
through the halls and stacks
of the library thinking

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:07.830
about how the constitutions
enormous data

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:10.900
as scores might be put to
novel and creative uses.

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:15.030
Along the way I've talked to
so very many interesting people

00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:17.340
and I've had the chance to see
the chance to see so many very,

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:19.150
very interesting things.

00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:21.770
Now this podcast is a chance to
share those interesting things

00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:23.070
and people with you,

00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:24.680
and to share the
things I've been doing.

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:28.400
Now, this episode is a little
bit different; now for starters,

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:32.670
I'm recording this in front
of an audience, hi everyone.

00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:33.970
&gt;&gt; Hello.

00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:35.270
&gt;&gt; Hey.

00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:36.570
&gt;&gt; Jer Thorp: We're
also doing this

00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:37.870
in the grand surroundings
well, much grander surroundings

00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:40.280
than my makeshift home
and studio in Brooklyn.

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:42.410
We're in the Whittall Pavilion
in the Jefferson Building

00:07:42.410 --> 00:07:46.110
at the Library of Congress; it's
kind of an amazing room, right?

00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:50.610
Now, let me see how can I
describe it to you who all

00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:52.220
of you who weren't here?

00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:54.080
Oh, I know, Joel can
you describe it for us?

00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:55.380
&gt;&gt; Joel Snyder: Why not.

00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:59.870
I would say that this
high ceilinged room,

00:07:59.870 --> 00:08:01.600
first of all, is rectangular.

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:05.790
About the size of one
half of tennis court.

00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:10.920
Each wall is topped by a
white balustrade or railing

00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:14.430
as one might see on a balcony,
below it is a long strip

00:08:14.430 --> 00:08:17.850
of white extending along
each side of the room.

00:08:17.850 --> 00:08:21.150
Below the ornamental
top are square panels

00:08:21.150 --> 00:08:23.620
in two shades of yellow.

00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:27.250
Lighting is set behind the
balustrade glowing toward

00:08:27.250 --> 00:08:28.550
the ceiling.

00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:29.910
Five rows of chairs

00:08:29.910 --> 00:08:33.110
with a center aisle are
set facing a platform

00:08:33.110 --> 00:08:36.670
with two chairs behind this
arrangement is a large wood

00:08:36.670 --> 00:08:40.110
cabinet flanked on the left
by the United States flag

00:08:40.110 --> 00:08:44.110
and on the right by the blue
flag of the Library of Congress.

00:08:44.110 --> 00:08:48.090
The left of the U.S flag is
an exit and then a candelabra

00:08:48.090 --> 00:08:50.360
with three glowing lights,

00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:52.860
by lighting a hidden
shoulders portrait

00:08:52.860 --> 00:08:55.460
of a stern faced gentleman.

00:08:55.460 --> 00:08:59.430
To the right of the Library of
Congress flag is a glass case

00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:04.370
with wood recorders on display,
another three light candelabra

00:09:04.370 --> 00:09:08.040
and in the corner a sculpture
in black on a white pedestal,

00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:12.710
the sculpture depicts a male
and a female nude in an embrace

00:09:12.710 --> 00:09:15.220
and kiss while seated.

00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:20.300
The male's right arm rests
on the females left thigh.

00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:22.840
As you face the platform,
the left side

00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:27.560
of the room features three glass
case displays, in the center,

00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:29.230
a violin cello flanked

00:09:29.230 --> 00:09:34.150
by two cases each containing
two violas with a violin.

00:09:34.150 --> 00:09:37.340
The right side of the room
has four rectangular windows,

00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:40.920
two on either side of the
French doors in the center,

00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:46.310
the doors are set behind a
tall rot iron gate on each side

00:09:46.310 --> 00:09:48.650
of the gate at center,

00:09:48.650 --> 00:09:53.610
is the delicate rot
iron design of a violin.

00:09:53.610 --> 00:09:58.120
At the rear of the room is a
black sculpture of two nudes,

00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:00.040
at left, a female is on

00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:01.860
Her knees reaching
up in the embrace

00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:04.170
and kiss of a seated male.

00:10:04.170 --> 00:10:07.080
Behind this display is ramp, you
may have used to enter the room.

00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:10.650
On the wall to the right
of the ramp is a Tapestry

00:10:10.650 --> 00:10:12.690
about five feet high
and seven feet

00:10:12.690 --> 00:10:15.390
across depicting a forest scene

00:10:15.390 --> 00:10:18.900
with eight individuals
in medieval dress.

00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:22.030
The room is carpeted in a
blue and green floral pattern

00:10:22.030 --> 00:10:24.090
with pink blossoms and finally,

00:10:24.090 --> 00:10:27.990
for this presentation two large
screen displays are at the left

00:10:27.990 --> 00:10:31.520
and right of the platform
in the front of the room.

00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:33.600
Does that sum it for
you Jer [laughter]

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:36.030
&gt;&gt; Jer Thorp: Joel
Snyder is a true pioneer

00:10:36.030 --> 00:10:37.580
in the field of audio
description.

00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:40.200
For almost forty years he's been
describing media and arts events

00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:42.260
for the blind and the
visually impaired.

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:44.220
To pick just a few of
the projects he'd work

00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:46.630
on in those last decades Joel

00:10:46.630 --> 00:10:50.050
and his staff has produce audio
descriptions for Sesame Street,

00:10:50.050 --> 00:10:51.980
for the National Park Service

00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:54.050
and for the Presidential
Inauguration Parades

00:10:54.050 --> 00:10:57.080
in 2009 and 2013.

00:10:57.080 --> 00:11:00.600
Joel, tell me a little bit
about audio description.

00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:02.850
&gt;&gt; Joel Snyder: Well,
thank you Jer I'm happy

00:11:02.850 --> 00:11:08.160
to because it's ironically
enough it's an access technique

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:11.540
that needs visibility, if
you'll forgive the expression.

00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:16.450
The title on my book on audio
description published in 2014

00:11:16.450 --> 00:11:17.860
by the American Council
of the Blind is,

00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:22.280
"The Visual Made Verbal" and
that's what description is,

00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:27.570
it's a translation of visual
images to words, synced words,

00:11:27.570 --> 00:11:33.440
vivid, imaginative to convey
that visual image of television,

00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:38.340
of film, of theater, of dance,
of operas, museum displays

00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:40.760
to a significant population.

00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:42.110
In this country alone there are

00:11:42.110 --> 00:11:47.350
over twenty one million
Americans who are either blind

00:11:47.350 --> 00:11:52.790
or to quote American
Foundation of Blind study,

00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:56.020
or have trouble seeing
even with correction,

00:11:56.020 --> 00:12:00.220
twenty one million that's
8% of the population.

00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:01.520
&gt;&gt; Jer Thorp: Well,
we're going to hear

00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:03.280
from Joel a few times
during today's episode.

00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:04.580
One of the things
I've discovered

00:12:04.580 --> 00:12:07.440
from recording this
podcast about the library

00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:10.210
and all the amazing objects
is just how difficult it is

00:12:10.210 --> 00:12:12.470
to give a good description of
things and I knew that people

00:12:12.470 --> 00:12:15.010
who were listening the
podcast who might not be able

00:12:15.010 --> 00:12:17.210
to see what we're talking
about or to look at a picture

00:12:17.210 --> 00:12:19.330
that we post on link,
would benefit tremendously

00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:21.300
from Joel's work, so thank
you Joel and we're hear

00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:23.530
from you a little bit later.

00:12:23.530 --> 00:12:25.900
Now, of all the mysterious and
wonderful nooks and crannies

00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:28.340
of this place perhaps
the most delightful

00:12:28.340 --> 00:12:30.710
and certainly the most
intriguingly made is the

00:12:30.710 --> 00:12:32.060
Catbird Seat.

00:12:32.060 --> 00:12:34.720
Home to the library's
poetry department,

00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:36.020
located up in the attic floor

00:12:36.020 --> 00:12:38.250
of this building the room
overlooks the Grand Hall

00:12:38.250 --> 00:12:41.170
to one side and the roof to
the Capitol in the other.

00:12:41.170 --> 00:12:43.640
In summary, I think it's fair to
see that our first guest has one

00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:45.840
of the best offices
in the world.

00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:48.080
Robert Casper is head of the
Poetry and Literature Center

00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:49.380
at the Library of Congress.

00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:52.020
Hello Robert and welcome
to Artists in the Archive.

00:12:52.020 --> 00:12:53.320
&gt;&gt; Robert Casper: Hi.

00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:55.620
&gt;&gt; Jer Thorp: Come on up.

00:12:59.750 --> 00:13:02.990
Robert, you're permanence
is different from a lot

00:13:02.990 --> 00:13:05.830
of the other departments
in the library,

00:13:05.830 --> 00:13:09.580
not only because you have
the best office [laughter]

00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:12.520
but also unlike all the
other departments or most

00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:14.190
of the other departments
you're not necessarily a

00:13:14.190 --> 00:13:15.490
collecting department.

00:13:15.490 --> 00:13:17.160
If I go up to the poetry
departments I'm not going

00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:19.960
to find stacks and
stacks of poetry,

00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:24.420
instead I'm maybe am
going to find poets.

00:13:24.420 --> 00:13:25.920
&gt;&gt;Robert Casper: You may,
you'll definitely find us.

00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:30.850
But there are a number
of divisions and centers

00:13:30.850 --> 00:13:33.110
at the library that are
not collections based.

00:13:33.110 --> 00:13:35.720
I think we're most note
worthy for being the home

00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:37.520
of the U.S Poet Laureate.

00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:39.220
&gt;&gt; Jer Thorp: Can
you tell us that,

00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:43.520
I think all of us have heard
about the poet laureate,

00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:47.020
but we might have some
confusion as to what they do.

00:13:47.020 --> 00:13:49.040
Can you tell us what
the poet laureate does?

00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:50.340
&gt;&gt; Robert Casper: Right.

00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:52.760
The poet laureate position was
originally called the consult

00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:55.270
in poetry position,
it was established

00:13:55.270 --> 00:13:58.270
around eighty years ago by
the Library of Congress;

00:13:58.270 --> 00:14:02.260
it was changed by an
active congress in 1985

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:06.590
to its current title the poet
laureate consultant in poetry

00:14:06.590 --> 00:14:09.080
at the Library of
Congress, a real mouthful.

00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:13.450
The poet laureate,
according to the law,

00:14:13.450 --> 00:14:18.050
is selected by the librarian of
congress based entirely on merit

00:14:18.050 --> 00:14:21.310
and there really isn't anything
that a poet laureate has to do

00:14:21.310 --> 00:14:25.100
in the position, we usually
have the poet laureate give an

00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:29.890
opening and a closing talk to
kick off our literary season

00:14:29.890 --> 00:14:32.510
in September and end
things in the end of April,

00:14:32.510 --> 00:14:35.650
beginning of May; but
other than that, really,

00:14:35.650 --> 00:14:38.870
the laureate serves as
an ambassador for the art

00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:42.280
and represents the office
and the library in his

00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:45.580
or her trips throughout
the country that year.

00:14:45.580 --> 00:14:47.440
&gt;&gt; Jer Thorp: And you've had
some pretty amazing American

00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:50.550
poets as poet laureate, Robert
Frost, Gwendolyn Brooks,

00:14:50.550 --> 00:14:52.920
Billy Collins, Rita Dove,

00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:57.240
and the most recent poet
laureate, Tracy K. Smith.

00:14:57.240 --> 00:15:00.550
I didn't ask you here to talk
about poet laureate's though,

00:15:00.550 --> 00:15:04.520
I asked you here to
show everybody and talk

00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:09.000
about maybe my favorite object
that I've had the chance

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:13.020
to see while I've been here
and this object is sitting

00:15:13.020 --> 00:15:19.020
on the table in front of the
us and what it is actually,

00:15:19.020 --> 00:15:22.340
why don't you tell
us what it is.

00:15:22.340 --> 00:15:23.640
&gt;&gt; Robert Casper: Sure.

00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:25.500
When I started at the
library about seven years,

00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:30.630
first of all ago I found this
book in one of the drawers

00:15:30.630 --> 00:15:34.470
of the old furniture that
we have given to us notably

00:15:34.470 --> 00:15:38.130
by Gertrude Whittall, in
the early '40s the person

00:15:38.130 --> 00:15:39.430
for him this room is named.

00:15:39.430 --> 00:15:46.080
This is a book that says on its
cover, "Poets Corner" I open it

00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:49.570
up to realize that it has
all the days of the year

00:15:49.570 --> 00:15:54.620
and signatures of
various poets and writers,

00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:57.630
and even a few Library of
Congress staff who've been

00:15:57.630 --> 00:16:00.670
up in the office for
events or what have you,

00:16:00.670 --> 00:16:02.940
and it covers basically
the eighty years

00:16:02.940 --> 00:16:06.300
of the offices history.

00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:08.770
So you have all sorts of
wonderful famous people

00:16:08.770 --> 00:16:11.770
and you have a lot of people
who weren't famous in here.

00:16:11.770 --> 00:16:13.070
&gt;&gt; Jer Thorp: Let's
take a moment

00:16:13.070 --> 00:16:14.370
to describe this book, Joel.

00:16:14.370 --> 00:16:15.670
&gt;&gt; Joel Snyder: Sure.

00:16:15.670 --> 00:16:19.440
This is a small, small
diary like bound volume

00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:22.430
and rectangular shaped
situated vertically.

00:16:22.430 --> 00:16:26.040
The edges of its brown front
are slightly worn although,

00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:29.710
it is adorned with
gold ornamentation,

00:16:29.710 --> 00:16:32.310
lines that frame the shape.

00:16:32.310 --> 00:16:35.470
To the right at center
is a brass lock,

00:16:35.470 --> 00:16:37.240
at bottom in gold lettering,

00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:41.290
"Poets Corner" the book's
pages are lined horizontally

00:16:41.290 --> 00:16:44.260
and at the top of each
page is the month and date

00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:49.920
at the top left of each page is
printed the number 19 [laughter]

00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:51.730
&gt;&gt; Jer Thorp: Yeah.

00:16:51.730 --> 00:16:57.570
So this object fascinates me
and I'll tell you why it's

00:16:57.570 --> 00:17:00.110
because every poet
who's done a reading

00:17:00.110 --> 00:17:02.890
at the library has signed
this book, well, most of them,

00:17:02.890 --> 00:17:05.660
let's say not of
them, an awful lot

00:17:05.660 --> 00:17:09.280
of them have signed this book.

00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:12.770
[Laughter] and they signed
it across the span of many,

00:17:12.770 --> 00:17:15.220
many decades, you know
what the earliest signature

00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:16.520
in the book is?

00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:18.600
&gt;&gt; Robert Casper: I think
the earliest signature is

00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:22.560
from the early '40s but
I wouldn't who's it was

00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:24.740
or when it was but I think
we've discovered them

00:17:24.740 --> 00:17:27.810
from I think, 1941, 1942.

00:17:27.810 --> 00:17:30.400
&gt;&gt; Jer Thorp: So along with
a signature from 1941 and 42,

00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:32.210
you might have a
signature from last week.

00:17:32.210 --> 00:17:34.070
And by the way the
book is organized

00:17:34.070 --> 00:17:36.070
and by the way it
says it's called,

00:17:36.070 --> 00:17:37.540
"Poets Corner" I love this.

00:17:37.540 --> 00:17:40.400
What this was intended
for was for a poet

00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:44.980
and the poet would write they
would write their poetry in sort

00:17:44.980 --> 00:17:49.240
of day by day and it would be
a day to collect your poems,

00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:53.870
but instead of doing that you
collected poets in this book.

00:17:53.870 --> 00:17:57.900
Every page in this book is a
day in the year, 365 pages,

00:17:57.900 --> 00:17:59.600
and they're all signed
by different people

00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:01.610
so if we picked a
page at random,

00:18:01.610 --> 00:18:06.000
Robert can you pick
a page at random?

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:09.940
[Laughter] we'll find
[inaudible] so which date

00:18:09.940 --> 00:18:14.610
&gt;&gt; Robert Casper: Well, this is
April 3, it's one of the pages

00:18:14.610 --> 00:18:15.910
that doesn't have a marker,

00:18:15.910 --> 00:18:20.810
but in 1959 on April 3
Robert Frost was here.

00:18:20.810 --> 00:18:26.070
The problem with a lot of these
signatures is they're really

00:18:26.070 --> 00:18:28.000
hard to read [laughter] Greg
Gliner a poet who I've heard

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:37.040
of was here in 1979 from Iowa,
it was first signed in 1953

00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:40.460
by a woman named Christine
whose last name I can't read

00:18:40.460 --> 00:18:43.710
from New York, New York.

00:18:43.710 --> 00:18:46.290
&gt;&gt; Jer Thorp: And we could
page through this book

00:18:46.290 --> 00:18:48.380
and you'll have a chance to
take a look at afterwards

00:18:48.380 --> 00:18:50.720
for the people in the audience
and we'll post as many pictures

00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:53.580
as we can for the people
who are listening along,

00:18:53.580 --> 00:18:58.150
when I saw this book for the
first time I think we picked

00:18:58.150 --> 00:19:00.320
three pages, more
or less at random,

00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:05.000
on the first page was Borges on
the second page was Robert Frost

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:08.440
and on the third page
three lines apart

00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:10.160
from each other were
Allen Ginsberg

00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:15.950
and Paul Simon [laughter] and
what I love about the book is

00:19:15.950 --> 00:19:19.560
that it offers these connections
between people that you,

00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:24.410
as somebody who knows American
poetry inside and out or me,

00:19:24.410 --> 00:19:28.200
as somebody who does not know
American poetry very well.

00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:31.750
In our minds, kind of, come

00:19:31.750 --> 00:19:34.690
up with a connection
between these poets.

00:19:34.690 --> 00:19:36.850
One of the things that
we're going to be talking

00:19:36.850 --> 00:19:38.840
about throughout the course of
this podcast show are things

00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:43.120
that act exactly like this book.

00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:45.940
There are things that act
as the kind of instrument

00:19:45.940 --> 00:19:51.210
to play a wide collection
of in this case kind

00:19:51.210 --> 00:19:56.320
of poets and their work.

00:19:56.320 --> 00:20:02.560
One of most interesting things
that I imagined about this

00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:09.400
and this is where I get
a little I was going

00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:11.870
to use the word poetic,
it's not the right word.

00:20:11.870 --> 00:20:13.170
&gt;&gt; Robert Casper: Feel free.

00:20:13.170 --> 00:20:14.880
&gt;&gt; Jer Thorp: Is that on a day
like today, maybe we can find,

00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:17.820
can we find today in the book?

00:20:17.820 --> 00:20:20.030
We have this instrument
which allows to us kind

00:20:20.030 --> 00:20:21.920
of condor a list of poets

00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:25.770
and in my head these poets
would be sitting together

00:20:25.770 --> 00:20:28.730
in this room, advert seat
and they would have a kind

00:20:28.730 --> 00:20:30.030
of a dialog with each other.

00:20:30.030 --> 00:20:32.320
Who do we have today?

00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:41.060
&gt;&gt; Today we have Tom Stoppard
from 1982 and Wilbert Snow

00:20:41.060 --> 00:20:53.800
from 1961, M. Travers from
1954 and a lot of other people

00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:55.700
who just have terribly
illegible.

00:20:55.700 --> 00:21:00.220
[Laughter] various other people,
it's actually a pretty full day,

00:21:00.220 --> 00:21:02.000
it's one of those days
that makes it hard

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:07.020
for contemporary readers at
the poetry and literary center

00:21:07.020 --> 00:21:09.130
to find a place to sign so.

00:21:09.130 --> 00:21:11.470
&gt;&gt; Jer Thorp: It would be a
crowded day in the Catbird Seat

00:21:11.470 --> 00:21:16.000
if we were going to get
all of them together.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:23.770
One question that I wanted
to ask you is sort of related

00:21:23.770 --> 00:21:27.960
to this but it's more of a
discussion about a new position

00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:32.070
that you've I think just
this year come up with,

00:21:32.070 --> 00:21:36.690
which is the is it called
the youth poet laureate?

00:21:36.690 --> 00:21:40.680
&gt;&gt; Robert Casper: It's
not our position, no, no.

00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:47.020
And in fact, for many years
we've avoided having anything

00:21:47.020 --> 00:21:51.050
to do with other poet laureate
positions because of the fact

00:21:51.050 --> 00:21:52.350
that we have this law

00:21:52.350 --> 00:21:55.740
that established our position it
is a U.S poet laureate position.

00:21:55.740 --> 00:22:03.110
This year we featured the
National Youth Poet Laureate

00:22:03.110 --> 00:22:06.690
part of a [inaudible] program
that comes from Urban Word

00:22:06.690 --> 00:22:09.960
from New York City,
a nationwide program.

00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:13.400
We've featured the first ever
youth poet laureate giving the

00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:18.140
opening reading for our new
poet laureate, Tracy K. Smith,

00:22:18.140 --> 00:22:19.440
so that was a big deal.

00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:23.920
We've also went subsequently
featured the youth poet laureate

00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:27.100
in events, selects events
including one coming

00:22:27.100 --> 00:22:33.810
up in just a week, but one of
the great joys of this job is

00:22:33.810 --> 00:22:38.450
of the institution is that
it gives me the opportunity

00:22:38.450 --> 00:22:42.130
to champion the work that
other organizations are doing,

00:22:42.130 --> 00:22:44.470
other individuals are
doing to promote poetry

00:22:44.470 --> 00:22:51.280
because the laureateship and
the library is so instrumental

00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:57.610
to our creative life and that
sort of the understanding

00:22:57.610 --> 00:23:04.320
of what libraries do so it's
a great place to bring people

00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:06.550
like Amanda Gorman, who
was a real firecracker

00:23:06.550 --> 00:23:11.950
of a first National Youth
Poet Laureate to the library.

00:23:11.950 --> 00:23:13.250
&gt;&gt; Jer Thorp: If people do want

00:23:13.250 --> 00:23:14.550
to get involved more
close closely

00:23:14.550 --> 00:23:16.710
with what the poetry department
is doing, you have a blog

00:23:16.710 --> 00:23:20.620
which you've been running since
2012 and it's fabulous and full

00:23:20.620 --> 00:23:22.820
of a wealth of information
that can you find

00:23:22.820 --> 00:23:26.170
at blogs.LOC.gov/catbird, right?

00:23:26.170 --> 00:23:27.470
&gt;&gt; Robert Casper: Yeah.

00:23:27.470 --> 00:23:28.770
&gt;&gt; Jer Thorp: And are
there any particular events

00:23:28.770 --> 00:23:30.270
that are coming up that you
think people might be interested

00:23:30.270 --> 00:23:32.480
to tune in for to watch?

00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:33.780
&gt;&gt; Robert Casper: Yeah.

00:23:33.780 --> 00:23:37.260
April 19 our current
poet laureate,

00:23:37.260 --> 00:23:41.200
Tracy K. Smith will give her
closing, really more of a talk

00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:45.270
and for the first time it'll be
followed by moderate discussion

00:23:45.270 --> 00:23:49.420
by Washington Post
book editor Ron Charles

00:23:49.420 --> 00:23:52.400
who also has a written series
with us called, "Life of a Poet.

00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:53.700
That's all I'll say
about it now,

00:23:53.700 --> 00:23:56.310
but it should be a really
note worthy eventually.

00:23:56.310 --> 00:24:00.100
In the room across the way,
in the Coolidge Auditorium

00:24:00.100 --> 00:24:01.690
so people can come to that.

00:24:01.690 --> 00:24:03.010
&gt;&gt; Jer Thorp: I have
one more question

00:24:03.010 --> 00:24:06.100
and this is a selfish
one, have you thought

00:24:06.100 --> 00:24:10.140
about getting this
book digitized?

00:24:10.140 --> 00:24:13.550
&gt;&gt; Robert Casper: No, but
I was seated next to one

00:24:13.550 --> 00:24:17.350
of your follow up
guests who I talked

00:24:17.350 --> 00:24:20.380
to about maybe repairing
the book a little bit

00:24:20.380 --> 00:24:22.110
because there's a
page that's coming out

00:24:22.110 --> 00:24:24.610
and it could use a little love.

00:24:24.610 --> 00:24:26.910
&gt;&gt; Jer Thorp: Well, you just
gave me the best que possible

00:24:26.910 --> 00:24:29.880
for our next guest, but
thank you Robert Casper.

00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:31.680
&gt;&gt; Robert Casper: My pleasure.

00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:36.510
[Applauding]

00:24:36.510 --> 00:25:02.390
[Music]

00:25:02.390 --> 00:25:04.140
&gt;&gt; Jer Thorp: That was the
transition you should have

00:25:04.140 --> 00:25:05.440
heard earlier.

00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:06.740
[Laughter]

00:25:06.740 --> 00:25:08.040
&gt;&gt; Adrienne Lundgren:
Better late than never.

00:25:08.040 --> 00:25:09.340
[Laughter]

00:25:09.340 --> 00:25:11.140
&gt;&gt; Jer Thorp: And this
is next transition.

00:25:11.140 --> 00:25:37.040
[Music]

00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:39.530
F. Holland Day was
born in Boston in 1864

00:25:39.530 --> 00:25:43.340
to a millionaire father; he
was an extraordinary man not

00:25:43.340 --> 00:25:45.240
in the least for
the figure he cut,

00:25:45.240 --> 00:25:49.770
he'd often be spotted wearing on
opera cloak, a broad black hat,

00:25:49.770 --> 00:25:52.990
a long cigarette holder with
a flat Russian cigarette.

00:25:52.990 --> 00:25:55.350
He worked in his
pajamas, wearing a turban

00:25:55.350 --> 00:25:58.340
and a yellow dressing
[inaudible] with red slippers

00:25:58.340 --> 00:26:00.330
that turned up at the toes.

00:26:00.330 --> 00:26:03.460
He wrote, or so it's
told by the light only

00:26:03.460 --> 00:26:05.270
by the light of 41 candles.

00:26:05.270 --> 00:26:07.910
Our next guest is
Adrienne Lundgren

00:26:07.910 --> 00:26:12.920
who is the senior conservator,
senior photo conservator

00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:15.450
with a okay, you say it.

00:26:15.450 --> 00:26:16.750
&gt;&gt; Adrienne Lundgren:
[Inaudible]

00:26:16.750 --> 00:26:18.050
&gt;&gt; Jer Thorp: Yeah.

00:26:18.050 --> 00:26:19.350
[Inaudible] Adrienne.

00:26:19.350 --> 00:26:20.650
&gt;&gt; Adrienne Lundgren: Yeah?

00:26:20.650 --> 00:26:21.950
&gt;&gt; Jer Thorp: Welcome to
the Artists in the Archive.

00:26:21.950 --> 00:26:23.250
&gt;&gt; Adrienne Lundgren: Thank you
so much it's an honor, really.

00:26:23.250 --> 00:26:25.270
&gt;&gt; Jer Thorp: Now, you
have had a chance to dig

00:26:25.270 --> 00:26:30.300
in to F. Holland Day's career
to an extraordinarily level.

00:26:30.300 --> 00:26:32.690
Can you tell us the story
about how that happened?

00:26:32.690 --> 00:26:35.130
&gt;&gt; Adrienne Lundgren: Well,
it started because I work here

00:26:35.130 --> 00:26:39.180
at the library and we
have the best collection

00:26:39.180 --> 00:26:40.870
of the F. Holland Day
probably in the world,

00:26:40.870 --> 00:26:44.110
we have the largest for sure
collection, came directly

00:26:44.110 --> 00:26:49.050
from his estate upon his death
and I became very interested

00:26:49.050 --> 00:26:55.100
in just learning about how
people I wanted to do a project

00:26:55.100 --> 00:26:59.270
where I created a material space
catalog raising [inaudible]

00:26:59.270 --> 00:27:03.150
photographer to really show how
people could look at photographs

00:27:03.150 --> 00:27:05.830
as objects, not just as images

00:27:05.830 --> 00:27:08.540
and the Day collection
really stood out as something

00:27:08.540 --> 00:27:12.770
that had incredible
depths and provenance

00:27:12.770 --> 00:27:17.940
and so I was awarded a Kluge
Staff Fellowship in 2012

00:27:17.940 --> 00:27:20.340
to really look into his work.

00:27:20.340 --> 00:27:24.890
And as a conservator, I did that
in a materials way so looking

00:27:24.890 --> 00:27:27.530
at all of his papers and
the way he mounts things

00:27:27.530 --> 00:27:30.100
and how he process
things and everything.

00:27:30.100 --> 00:27:33.620
So I looked at all
seven hundred well,

00:27:33.620 --> 00:27:36.210
before we had seven hundred
and thirty something prints

00:27:36.210 --> 00:27:38.600
and now we have found
seven hundred

00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:41.040
and fifty something
prints now so

00:27:41.040 --> 00:27:42.340
&gt;&gt; Jer Thorp: So
in total you have?

00:27:42.340 --> 00:27:43.750
&gt;&gt; Adrienne Lundgren:
Seven hundred

00:27:43.750 --> 00:27:47.740
and fifty two at my last count.

00:27:47.740 --> 00:27:49.040
&gt;&gt; Jer Thorp: Okay.

00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:51.950
So we have a few we tried
the get the prints here,

00:27:51.950 --> 00:27:57.990
but they're very important,
you needed an armed escort

00:27:57.990 --> 00:28:02.590
and something like that and
guns in this room so we said no,

00:28:02.590 --> 00:28:07.090
we're going to show you some
digital images and Joel's going

00:28:07.090 --> 00:28:08.620
to describe a couple
of them for us,

00:28:08.620 --> 00:28:11.060
but not this particular image.

00:28:11.060 --> 00:28:14.960
I know you picked a few of
them just represented kind

00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:16.260
of a span of

00:28:16.260 --> 00:28:17.560
&gt;&gt; Adrienne Lundgren: Yeah.

00:28:17.560 --> 00:28:19.120
Things that he's known to have
photographed in his career,

00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:20.920
kind of, periods of his work.

00:28:20.920 --> 00:28:24.580
So this one is he's
known for male nudes

00:28:24.580 --> 00:28:30.760
and this male nude was made
probably in 1898, 1899 and it's

00:28:30.760 --> 00:28:34.740
of someone that we imagine well,

00:28:34.740 --> 00:28:39.970
it's the archival record doesn't
really tell us all that much,

00:28:39.970 --> 00:28:42.570
but we image that they
were probably lovers

00:28:42.570 --> 00:28:46.630
or he definitely had a
romantic interest in this fellow

00:28:46.630 --> 00:28:50.750
to this is Thomas Langryl
Harris and he's in the pose

00:28:50.750 --> 00:28:55.690
of dying slave inspired by
Michelangelo's dying slave so.

00:28:55.690 --> 00:28:58.840
I always loved this piece.

00:28:58.840 --> 00:29:00.140
&gt;&gt; Jer Thorp: And this image?

00:29:00.140 --> 00:29:01.440
&gt;&gt; Adrienne Lundgren: [Laughter]

00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:05.020
so this is what Day is most
known for which is his focus

00:29:05.020 --> 00:29:09.210
on sacred subjects are he
reenacted passion of Christ

00:29:09.210 --> 00:29:13.360
and so on the cross here you
see F. Holland Day himself,

00:29:13.360 --> 00:29:20.040
and he kind of created this
cross and crucified himself,

00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:24.820
like, with ropes, but
starved himself, well,

00:29:24.820 --> 00:29:27.150
he was very thin any way's so
who knows if he starved himself,

00:29:27.150 --> 00:29:30.320
but he grew his beard and his
hair and he reenacted The Road

00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:35.230
to Calvary, The Crucifixion
and you can show the next one

00:29:35.230 --> 00:29:38.770
which is I think, the
Seven Last Words of Christ,

00:29:38.770 --> 00:29:42.290
so it's the seven last thoughts
that Christ thought dying

00:29:42.290 --> 00:29:47.560
on the cross and then he also
does the Resurrection and yeah,

00:29:47.560 --> 00:29:48.940
so that's Day right there.

00:29:48.940 --> 00:29:51.960
&gt;&gt; Jer Thorp: Joel as a
description for this image.

00:29:51.960 --> 00:29:57.080
&gt;&gt; Joel Snyder: This is a series
of seven crucifixion images set

00:29:57.080 --> 00:30:01.390
out horizontally, but each
is focused on the head

00:30:01.390 --> 00:30:04.810
of the bearded Christ
wearing a crown of thorns.

00:30:04.810 --> 00:30:09.380
The images are set between
drawings of columns from left

00:30:09.380 --> 00:30:14.230
to right Christ with eyes
reflecting a forlorn weariness

00:30:14.230 --> 00:30:17.050
gazes up and to the right.

00:30:17.050 --> 00:30:22.470
Then to the left, downcast, and
to the right with eyes closed

00:30:22.470 --> 00:30:25.630
with his mouth and eyes
open wide while turned

00:30:25.630 --> 00:30:27.320
to the left and up.

00:30:27.320 --> 00:30:31.830
Then with eyes cast downward,
next with his head back

00:30:31.830 --> 00:30:35.670
and eyes closed, lips
slightly parted and finally,

00:30:35.670 --> 00:30:40.220
with eyes closed and his head
lying on his right shoulder.

00:30:40.220 --> 00:30:44.760
The columns support a railing or
[inaudible] which words appear,

00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:48.960
"Father forgive them they
know not what they do"

00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:53.950
"Today thou shalt be with
me in paradise" "Woman,

00:30:53.950 --> 00:30:59.500
behold thy son, son
by mother" "My God,

00:30:59.500 --> 00:31:03.830
my God why has thou
forsaken me?"

00:31:03.830 --> 00:31:09.880
"I thirst into thy hands"
I commend my spirit"

00:31:09.880 --> 00:31:12.180
"It is finished"

00:31:13.610 --> 00:31:16.980
&gt;&gt; Jer Thorp: This
image is so striking.

00:31:16.980 --> 00:31:18.820
&gt;&gt; Adrienne Lundgren:
Isn't it incredible?

00:31:18.820 --> 00:31:20.120
&gt;&gt; Jer Thorp: Yeah.

00:31:20.120 --> 00:31:22.840
&gt;&gt; Adrienne Lundgren: I mean,
I'm just fascinated by this.

00:31:22.840 --> 00:31:29.620
So this image was done F.
Holland Day had in 1904, like,

00:31:29.620 --> 00:31:35.190
catastrophic studio fire and he
lost many of his prints and most

00:31:35.190 --> 00:31:37.040
of his negatives in that fire

00:31:37.040 --> 00:31:39.510
and most people consider his
career over at that point,

00:31:39.510 --> 00:31:42.110
but actually, I think
that the work that he does

00:31:42.110 --> 00:31:45.840
after that studio fire is even
more spectacular than the work

00:31:45.840 --> 00:31:48.830
that he did before and
this image comes a year

00:31:48.830 --> 00:31:50.170
after that studio fire.

00:31:50.170 --> 00:31:57.850
So he went to the Hampton
Normal and Agricultural School

00:31:57.850 --> 00:32:01.260
in Hampton, Virginia, which
is now Hampton University,

00:32:01.260 --> 00:32:05.790
and he took photographs there
of the faculty and the students;

00:32:05.790 --> 00:32:08.060
they had a camera club
and so he went to work

00:32:08.060 --> 00:32:09.370
with the students there.

00:32:09.370 --> 00:32:14.290
And I just think the images from
Hampton are some of his best.

00:32:14.290 --> 00:32:19.270
I love how she's so
shadowed in the front

00:32:19.270 --> 00:32:23.240
and then the girl bend
behind her is like luminous.

00:32:23.240 --> 00:32:25.330
&gt;&gt; Jer Thorp: And Joel ad
a description of this image

00:32:25.330 --> 00:32:27.550
as well because think it's
just, yeah it's wonderful.

00:32:27.550 --> 00:32:31.050
&gt;&gt; Joel Snyder: A black and
white photograph rectangular

00:32:31.050 --> 00:32:34.730
and set vertically
an interior of a room

00:32:34.730 --> 00:32:37.240
with a curtained
window at right,

00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:41.440
in the four grounded right,
the Silhouette of black woman

00:32:41.440 --> 00:32:46.380
to the left and behind her
is a younger black female

00:32:46.380 --> 00:32:48.690
in a bright white dress,

00:32:48.690 --> 00:32:55.160
her hair adorned behind
her head with a white bow.

00:32:55.160 --> 00:32:57.720
&gt;&gt; Jer Thorp: One more image
and then we'll get deep

00:32:57.720 --> 00:32:59.390
into what these images are

00:32:59.390 --> 00:33:01.130
because I think it's
fascinating.

00:33:01.130 --> 00:33:02.430
&gt;&gt; Adrienne Lundgren: Yeah.

00:33:02.430 --> 00:33:05.700
So this is from Day, he did a
lot of allegorical subjects,

00:33:05.700 --> 00:33:09.330
the Prodigal's Son and this is
one part of a series called,

00:33:09.330 --> 00:33:14.730
"Orpheus" I just really liked
the composition of this,

00:33:14.730 --> 00:33:17.580
the way it's printed and you'll
see in a lot of the images

00:33:17.580 --> 00:33:19.980
that we showed of Day
he has a very unique way

00:33:19.980 --> 00:33:24.430
of mounting his images on these
multi layered paper supports,

00:33:24.430 --> 00:33:27.240
I just that they add
a lot to the feeling

00:33:27.240 --> 00:33:30.640
and tension surrounding
the image and he was kind

00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:34.320
of the inventor of this style
of mounting which become known

00:33:34.320 --> 00:33:37.620
as the American Style.

00:33:37.620 --> 00:33:38.920
&gt;&gt; Jer Thorp: So Day was part

00:33:38.920 --> 00:33:42.480
of a photography movement
called photo secession, right?

00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:43.780
&gt;&gt; Adrienne Lundgren yeah.

00:33:43.780 --> 00:33:45.880
&gt;&gt; Jer Thorp: I love this
term, the photo secession,

00:33:45.880 --> 00:33:47.810
apparently it was chosen mainly

00:33:47.810 --> 00:33:50.790
because the word secession would
raise the hackles of Americans

00:33:50.790 --> 00:33:55.110
as they felt like I was
a very abrasive term

00:33:55.110 --> 00:33:59.750
and Alfred Stieglitz, who
was one of the other founders

00:33:59.750 --> 00:34:02.960
with this conversation
that I stumbled upon

00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:06.040
with Gertrude Käsebier
in which she said,

00:34:06.040 --> 00:34:08.980
what is photo secession, and
am I a photo secessionist?

00:34:08.980 --> 00:34:11.730
And he said well, do you
feel like you are one?

00:34:11.730 --> 00:34:13.030
And she said, I do.

00:34:13.030 --> 00:34:14.330
And he said, well,
that's all there is to it.

00:34:14.330 --> 00:34:15.630
&gt;&gt; Adrienne Lundgren actually,

00:34:15.630 --> 00:34:17.140
he was Alfred Stieglitz
said you were [laughter]

00:34:17.140 --> 00:34:20.340
and actually Day was
part of pictorialism,

00:34:20.340 --> 00:34:22.460
but not so much photo secession

00:34:22.460 --> 00:34:27.160
because photo secession you
needed Alfred Stieglitz's

00:34:27.160 --> 00:34:31.230
dissension and they
actually were not simpatico.

00:34:31.230 --> 00:34:35.030
So he was never part of the
formal movement although,

00:34:35.030 --> 00:34:37.100
his art is really
part point of view

00:34:37.100 --> 00:34:38.400
that movement so
it's interesting.

00:34:38.400 --> 00:34:39.840
&gt;&gt; Jer Thorp: And I think
what you're just describing

00:34:39.840 --> 00:34:42.450
about the objects sits
really well with kind

00:34:42.450 --> 00:34:45.100
of that movement what's
said that was significant

00:34:45.100 --> 00:34:47.310
about a photograph was not what
was in front of the camera,

00:34:47.310 --> 00:34:50.230
but the manipulation of the
image by the photographer.

00:34:50.230 --> 00:34:51.530
&gt;&gt; Adrienne Lundgren: Yes.

00:34:51.530 --> 00:34:52.830
&gt;&gt; Jer Thorp: And
I'm generalizing

00:34:52.830 --> 00:34:54.750
in probably a terrible way.

00:34:54.750 --> 00:35:00.680
So talk about how these
photographs physically

00:35:00.680 --> 00:35:01.980
were made.

00:35:01.980 --> 00:35:03.280
&gt;&gt; Adrienne Lundgren: Yeah.

00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:04.580
&gt;&gt; Jer Thorp: Because
I think it's different

00:35:04.580 --> 00:35:05.880
from what we would
sometimes imagine.

00:35:05.880 --> 00:35:07.180
&gt;&gt; Adrienne Lundgren: Yeah.

00:35:07.180 --> 00:35:09.370
So with this particular
era of photography,

00:35:09.370 --> 00:35:12.700
they were really trying to
legitimize photography and kind

00:35:12.700 --> 00:35:16.550
of put it on the same level as
other types of art like drawing

00:35:16.550 --> 00:35:19.680
and painting; and one of the
ways that they did that was

00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:21.910
through the manipulation
of the print.

00:35:21.910 --> 00:35:24.780
So one of the processes
that allowed

00:35:24.780 --> 00:35:29.680
for this really varied
manipulation was called the

00:35:29.680 --> 00:35:30.980
platinum process.

00:35:30.980 --> 00:35:34.460
So almost not everything Day
made, but most everything

00:35:34.460 --> 00:35:38.430
that he printed in his career
was made using the platinum

00:35:38.430 --> 00:35:43.180
printing process and platinum
is basically a paper support

00:35:43.180 --> 00:35:47.580
and the image is actually
made with platinum metal

00:35:47.580 --> 00:35:50.830
that is deposited into
the fibers of that paper.

00:35:50.830 --> 00:35:56.140
So they're extremely
stable, if made correctly,

00:35:56.140 --> 00:35:58.600
and were called the
prints of processes these

00:35:58.600 --> 00:36:03.710
because it has this
incredible richness and kind

00:36:03.710 --> 00:36:05.250
of what we call the
dynamic range,

00:36:05.250 --> 00:36:09.970
the levels between the bright
white and the dark, dark.

00:36:09.970 --> 00:36:11.420
Yeah.

00:36:11.420 --> 00:36:14.220
&gt;&gt; Jer Thorp: I think
there are some artists

00:36:14.220 --> 00:36:17.100
in our next guest who's from the
manuscript department will have

00:36:17.100 --> 00:36:19.550
some experience with
this who are meticulous

00:36:19.550 --> 00:36:23.740
in their recording of
when a work was made

00:36:23.740 --> 00:36:26.330
and how it was made
and so on and so on.

00:36:26.330 --> 00:36:28.930
It sounds to me like a
lot of your work is trying

00:36:28.930 --> 00:36:33.040
to like puzzle together the,
sort of, true dates of some

00:36:33.040 --> 00:36:37.050
of these works, maybe some
people in the room know this,

00:36:37.050 --> 00:36:39.400
but some people do not,
but in the basement

00:36:39.400 --> 00:36:42.180
of the Madison Building there
is an electron microscope

00:36:42.180 --> 00:36:47.040
and like a [inaudible] there's a
full, like, forensic laboratory

00:36:47.040 --> 00:36:51.970
that could totally be out
of a television show it's

00:36:51.970 --> 00:36:53.270
really amazing.

00:36:53.270 --> 00:36:54.570
&gt;&gt; Adrienne Lundgren: Yeah.

00:36:54.570 --> 00:36:55.870
&gt;&gt; Jer Thorp: So can
you talk about, like,

00:36:55.870 --> 00:36:57.170
the actual techniques
that you're using to try

00:36:57.170 --> 00:36:58.870
to make sense of this
large collection of images?

00:36:58.870 --> 00:37:00.170
&gt;&gt; Adrienne Lundgren: Yeah.

00:37:00.170 --> 00:37:01.470
So I mean, one of the things

00:37:01.470 --> 00:37:04.000
that I'm using is just really
systematic looking, like,

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:05.930
understanding how
these processes work

00:37:05.930 --> 00:37:10.090
and really cataloging all
the different variations

00:37:10.090 --> 00:37:14.010
that an artist could
use in making out.

00:37:14.010 --> 00:37:17.240
So that might include just
like I said, the mounts,

00:37:17.240 --> 00:37:21.350
just cataloging systematically
the mounts, but also looking

00:37:21.350 --> 00:37:23.580
at elemental composition
of the image.

00:37:23.580 --> 00:37:27.260
So really looking at
how that image was made

00:37:27.260 --> 00:37:29.410
and you can't always
do that with your eye.

00:37:29.410 --> 00:37:32.630
So one of the techniques that
we use is x ray fluorescence

00:37:32.630 --> 00:37:37.040
spectroscopy where we actually
it's a non distractive technique

00:37:37.040 --> 00:37:42.120
and you point that x ray beam at
the image and it excites atoms

00:37:42.120 --> 00:37:46.380
and gives you a spectra of the
elements that are in that sheet

00:37:46.380 --> 00:37:49.680
of paper and if you take
that spectra and combine it

00:37:49.680 --> 00:37:50.980
with the knowledge

00:37:50.980 --> 00:37:54.060
of the processes you can
really determine what type

00:37:54.060 --> 00:37:55.460
of technique they were using.

00:37:55.460 --> 00:37:59.550
So in the first image that we
looked up with the dying slave

00:37:59.550 --> 00:38:04.240
of Thomas Langryl Harris, that
image it's a platinum print,

00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:07.640
so it contains platinum, but
it also contains a large peek

00:38:07.640 --> 00:38:11.550
for mercury, so we know that
it was mercury process platinum

00:38:11.550 --> 00:38:14.080
print, which gives
it this brown tone.

00:38:14.080 --> 00:38:17.800
So artists tended to use
certain techniques habitually

00:38:17.800 --> 00:38:20.000
through their career
and so you can start

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:22.170
to understanding how much
manipulation they're doing,

00:38:22.170 --> 00:38:25.240
when they transfer from
technique, one technique

00:38:25.240 --> 00:38:27.850
to another, and it
kind of help you date

00:38:27.850 --> 00:38:30.810
and at tribute images to them.

00:38:30.810 --> 00:38:33.050
&gt;&gt; Jer Thorp: One thing
that I didn't bring

00:38:33.050 --> 00:38:36.220
up with our last guest, Robert
that I could have brought up was

00:38:36.220 --> 00:38:39.720
that the poetry department
sometimes is sort

00:38:39.720 --> 00:38:42.920
of either responsible for
or becomes the conduit

00:38:42.920 --> 00:38:46.190
to new discoveries of
poems that are attributed.

00:38:46.190 --> 00:38:49.770
I know that fairly recently
there was a new Walt Whitman

00:38:49.770 --> 00:38:54.680
poem that was discovered from
the manuscripts department

00:38:54.680 --> 00:38:57.550
or the sorry the
periodicals department.

00:38:57.550 --> 00:38:58.850
&gt;&gt; Adrienne Lundgren:
Oh, interesting.

00:38:58.850 --> 00:39:01.520
&gt;&gt; Jer Thorp: A poem that was
labeled WW somebody thought, oh,

00:39:01.520 --> 00:39:03.940
well, maybe this could
very well be a Whitman.

00:39:03.940 --> 00:39:07.370
Have there been photographs
that we didn't know

00:39:07.370 --> 00:39:10.550
that were F. Holland Day's
that we now know are?

00:39:10.550 --> 00:39:11.850
&gt;&gt; Adrienne Lundgren: Yes.

00:39:11.850 --> 00:39:13.890
Actually, there was
an interesting case

00:39:13.890 --> 00:39:19.010
where the curator in prints and
photographs bought down a print

00:39:19.010 --> 00:39:22.010
that had come in through the
Clarence H. White collection

00:39:22.010 --> 00:39:25.330
and F. Holland Day and Clarence
H. White were really good

00:39:25.330 --> 00:39:27.250
friends, he was the
Godfather to one of their kids

00:39:27.250 --> 00:39:29.840
and they had a very close
working relationship.

00:39:29.840 --> 00:39:32.810
They both did photographs
at the same time,

00:39:32.810 --> 00:39:36.680
so sometimes it can be difficult
when photographers are working,

00:39:36.680 --> 00:39:38.500
kind of, with the same
subjects and stuff

00:39:38.500 --> 00:39:41.140
to tell who's making what print.

00:39:41.140 --> 00:39:43.730
This print came down, it came
in through the Clarence H. White

00:39:43.730 --> 00:39:46.940
but it was unattributed
and through my work

00:39:46.940 --> 00:39:49.150
on cataloging all of
his photographic mounts

00:39:49.150 --> 00:39:53.200
and his techniques I was able
to link that print to Day

00:39:53.200 --> 00:39:56.490
and then I started really
looking at the literature trying

00:39:56.490 --> 00:40:00.090
to find any references
that might be somewhere

00:40:00.090 --> 00:40:02.560
and I was able to find
a print mounted almost

00:40:02.560 --> 00:40:04.740
in exactly the same
banner that was published,

00:40:04.740 --> 00:40:08.910
so it was kind the
cataloging and then looking

00:40:08.910 --> 00:40:12.070
at the historic literature
and we've been able

00:40:12.070 --> 00:40:15.170
to attribute quite a few
images that were misattributed

00:40:15.170 --> 00:40:18.720
or unattributed to Day now in
our collection, I think a total

00:40:18.720 --> 00:40:24.480
of six images that we've been
able to clarify the attributing.

00:40:24.480 --> 00:40:30.010
&gt;&gt; Jer Thorp: Last episode
we talked about an experiment

00:40:30.010 --> 00:40:32.710
that somebody in the labs
department did, Laura Ruble,

00:40:32.710 --> 00:40:36.230
who's sitting a few
rows back over here,

00:40:36.230 --> 00:40:40.200
made a really excellent little
tool that takes photographs

00:40:40.200 --> 00:40:42.610
and breaks them down
into small color pallets.

00:40:42.610 --> 00:40:43.910
&gt;&gt; Adrienne Lundgren: Right.

00:40:43.910 --> 00:40:45.460
&gt;&gt; Jer Thorp: Which
you can use to read

00:40:45.460 --> 00:40:47.400
across an archive
of photographs.

00:40:47.400 --> 00:40:50.350
I could imagine one of the
challenged as to being involved

00:40:50.350 --> 00:40:53.440
in photography is like,
how do you hold more

00:40:53.440 --> 00:40:56.830
than the five images than
we seen today in your mind

00:40:56.830 --> 00:40:59.990
for long enough to
remember how do these things

00:40:59.990 --> 00:41:03.150
and so the conversion of these
photographs into data I think,

00:41:03.150 --> 00:41:06.370
greatly it's just that process.

00:41:06.370 --> 00:41:07.670
&gt;&gt; Adrienne Lundgren:
Absolutely.

00:41:07.670 --> 00:41:10.720
&gt;&gt; Jer Thorp: And I know
that is some of the work

00:41:10.720 --> 00:41:12.020
that you're looking
to do, right?

00:41:12.020 --> 00:41:14.950
Is the sort of, I hate this
term but I'll use it once,

00:41:14.950 --> 00:41:18.140
kind of big data techniques
to analyze the collection

00:41:18.140 --> 00:41:20.690
as a whole, can you
talk a little bit

00:41:20.690 --> 00:41:21.990
about what you're doing?

00:41:21.990 --> 00:41:23.290
&gt;&gt;Adrienne Lundgren: Yeah.

00:41:23.290 --> 00:41:24.590
I mean, just with Day
or in other things too?

00:41:24.590 --> 00:41:25.890
&gt;&gt; Jer Thorp: In general, yeah.

00:41:25.890 --> 00:41:28.990
&gt;&gt; Adrienne Lundgren: I'm just
really interested in, I mean,

00:41:28.990 --> 00:41:32.630
conservators are very good
at systematic looking kind

00:41:32.630 --> 00:41:37.670
of it's part of the job
description, but we haven't been

00:41:37.670 --> 00:41:42.070
so good necessarily at recording
that in a way over time

00:41:42.070 --> 00:41:44.080
where we could start
to really see what

00:41:44.080 --> 00:41:48.790
that data told us beyond maybe
what an individual brings

00:41:48.790 --> 00:41:51.660
to the table, but really
looking at hundreds of things

00:41:51.660 --> 00:41:55.280
and then what does that
data tell us about things

00:41:55.280 --> 00:41:57.860
that we may never
have noticed before.

00:41:57.860 --> 00:42:02.160
So, you know, I did that with
Day and it's led to the redating

00:42:02.160 --> 00:42:04.120
of some prints, the
reattribution

00:42:04.120 --> 00:42:05.630
of many of the prints.

00:42:05.630 --> 00:42:09.430
Right now I'm also
looking at civil war maps

00:42:09.430 --> 00:42:11.890
so that's one thing that I'm
looking at with big data,

00:42:11.890 --> 00:42:14.300
but I think actually the
not exciting one I'm working

00:42:14.300 --> 00:42:15.830
on right now is looking

00:42:15.830 --> 00:42:18.930
in the collections the
general collection books,

00:42:18.930 --> 00:42:21.890
we have seventy eight
thousand books that are

00:42:21.890 --> 00:42:24.250
on photographic technologies
so of course,

00:42:24.250 --> 00:42:27.010
when I went into those
docs my head like exploded

00:42:27.010 --> 00:42:30.510
because it was incredible, it
was the most amazing things,

00:42:30.510 --> 00:42:32.460
it's one of my favorite
places on earth and I know

00:42:32.460 --> 00:42:35.300
that makes me a total nerd but

00:42:35.300 --> 00:42:36.790
&gt;&gt; Jer Thorp: You're
in good company.

00:42:36.790 --> 00:42:38.550
&gt;&gt; Adrienne Lundgren: It
was just like so amazing

00:42:38.550 --> 00:42:40.610
and then you open these
books and you realize

00:42:40.610 --> 00:42:43.550
that there are actually
photographs in those books.

00:42:43.550 --> 00:42:48.010
When conservators can see
photographs of a known date

00:42:48.010 --> 00:42:50.110
and then we would
have the recipes

00:42:50.110 --> 00:42:53.380
for when they made those
photographs how they made them,

00:42:53.380 --> 00:42:55.970
I was, like, oh, my gosh we
should start to mine this

00:42:55.970 --> 00:43:00.380
and I call it mapping the
geno mode 19th century

00:43:00.380 --> 00:43:02.520
manufactured photography.

00:43:02.520 --> 00:43:07.940
So how do we take it beyond just
one sample and actually start

00:43:07.940 --> 00:43:12.140
to catalog this data so that
it can show us new things

00:43:12.140 --> 00:43:13.920
about photography
that was manufactured

00:43:13.920 --> 00:43:15.770
in the 19th century;
and so we've started

00:43:15.770 --> 00:43:19.250
to mine the fifteen hundred
samples that we have collected

00:43:19.250 --> 00:43:23.320
and we're seeing like corporate
takeovers in photography

00:43:23.320 --> 00:43:26.360
that were happening in the
1880s with [inaudible] you know,

00:43:26.360 --> 00:43:28.760
and like just really
fascinating things

00:43:28.760 --> 00:43:31.680
that we never would
have understood before.

00:43:31.680 --> 00:43:32.980
So I think has a lot

00:43:32.980 --> 00:43:34.280
&gt;&gt; Jer Thorp: Egg politics.

00:43:34.280 --> 00:43:35.580
&gt;&gt; Adrienne Lundgren:
Egg politics, right?

00:43:35.580 --> 00:43:36.880
It's a dirty [inaudible]

00:43:36.880 --> 00:43:40.460
&gt;&gt; Jer Thorp: That was part
of the reason that I wanted

00:43:40.460 --> 00:43:43.030
to have this conversation
with you today was just sort

00:43:43.030 --> 00:43:46.340
of just get this sense of what
these types of techniques offer

00:43:46.340 --> 00:43:50.670
as a kind of way into this
largeness of an archive

00:43:50.670 --> 00:43:53.020
that is otherwise
sometimes I think can feel

00:43:53.020 --> 00:43:54.330
really impenetrable.

00:43:54.330 --> 00:43:55.630
&gt;&gt; Adrienne Lundgren:
Absolutely.

00:43:55.630 --> 00:43:58.510
We have, you know, sixteen
million photographs.

00:43:58.510 --> 00:43:59.810
&gt;&gt; Jer Thorp: Yeah.

00:43:59.810 --> 00:44:01.110
&gt;&gt; Adrienne Lundgren:
So we have a lot of work

00:44:01.110 --> 00:44:02.410
to do with mining it but

00:44:02.410 --> 00:44:03.710
&gt;&gt; Jer Thorp: And
also to learn more

00:44:03.710 --> 00:44:06.890
about F. Holland Day I mean,
what an amazing individual.

00:44:06.890 --> 00:44:10.840
I think that in some ways
Day was a human version

00:44:10.840 --> 00:44:12.140
of this book, right?

00:44:12.140 --> 00:44:13.660
Where he was a, kind of,

00:44:13.660 --> 00:44:17.160
a bridge between so
many different people

00:44:17.160 --> 00:44:20.160
and so many different
times, he found a Coplin

00:44:20.160 --> 00:44:23.970
and Day publishing which was
maybe most famous for kind

00:44:23.970 --> 00:44:26.740
of publishing this idea of
kind of the small magazine

00:44:26.740 --> 00:44:28.920
in America, he was part

00:44:28.920 --> 00:44:31.300
of a social club
called The Visionists.

00:44:31.300 --> 00:44:32.600
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:44:32.600 --> 00:44:33.960
&gt;&gt; Which included amongst
others Bliss Carmen,

00:44:33.960 --> 00:44:39.410
and Ralph Adams Cram and Harbert
Small and all kinds of people

00:44:39.410 --> 00:44:41.450
and then I think my
favorite weird connection,

00:44:41.450 --> 00:44:45.520
so through his philanthropic
work he was friends

00:44:45.520 --> 00:44:48.320
with a social worker
named Jessie Fremont Beale

00:44:48.320 --> 00:44:53.070
and one day Jessie Fremont Beale
wrote F. Holland Day a note

00:44:53.070 --> 00:44:55.510
and that note read, "I
wonder if you may happen

00:44:55.510 --> 00:44:58.380
to have an artist friend who
would care to be interested

00:44:58.380 --> 00:45:03.790
in a little Assyrian boy
whose name is Kahlil G.,

00:45:03.790 --> 00:45:06.670
who of course, was
Kahlil Gibran.

00:45:07.750 --> 00:45:12.580
This story it blows me
away, is there one piece

00:45:12.580 --> 00:45:17.740
of F. Holland Day
amazing strangeness

00:45:17.740 --> 00:45:19.310
that you want to leave with us?

00:45:19.310 --> 00:45:22.630
&gt;&gt; Adrienne Lundgren: Well,
I love that he's fascinating

00:45:22.630 --> 00:45:26.760
to study because of
his meticulous nature,

00:45:26.760 --> 00:45:29.820
which I think comes out of his
publishing days, but he's also

00:45:29.820 --> 00:45:33.520
such a he was such a generous
person and every letter

00:45:33.520 --> 00:45:37.270
that you see written to him was
thank you for thinking of me,

00:45:37.270 --> 00:45:38.730
thank you for sending me this,

00:45:38.730 --> 00:45:42.510
thank you for giving me my
education, sponsoring me

00:45:42.510 --> 00:45:45.310
for this, and so
I think, you know,

00:45:45.310 --> 00:45:49.710
his work with Kahlil Gibran
being able to become the writer

00:45:49.710 --> 00:45:51.710
that he was in direct
relationship

00:45:51.710 --> 00:45:53.660
to him knowing F. Holland Day

00:45:53.660 --> 00:45:57.310
and so it just feels really
great to study someone who's

00:45:57.310 --> 00:45:59.460
so fascinating, but also

00:45:59.460 --> 00:46:02.730
such a wonderful human
being too so, yeah.

00:46:02.730 --> 00:46:04.540
&gt;&gt; Jer Thorp: Well, speaking of
generosity, thank you for being

00:46:04.540 --> 00:46:05.840
so generous with our time.

00:46:05.840 --> 00:46:07.640
&gt;&gt; Adrienne Lundgren: Thank
you so much for having me.

00:46:07.640 --> 00:46:14.530
[Applauding]

00:46:14.530 --> 00:46:17.340
&gt;&gt; Jer Thorp: In the 1950s the
mathematician and metrologist,

00:46:17.340 --> 00:46:20.880
Edward Lorenz was
thinking about the weather.

00:46:20.880 --> 00:46:23.990
Now, Lorenz was experimenting
with statistical forecasting,

00:46:23.990 --> 00:46:26.460
but he found that his
simulations didn't match the

00:46:26.460 --> 00:46:30.770
messy, wet, reality
of the real world.

00:46:30.770 --> 00:46:32.600
Weather, right?

00:46:32.600 --> 00:46:35.280
So Lorenz set up to
development a nonlinear model

00:46:35.280 --> 00:46:38.170
that would match the
unpredictability of the nature.

00:46:38.170 --> 00:46:41.030
In 1963 he published
a paper called,

00:46:41.030 --> 00:46:43.990
"The Thermostatic Nonperiodic
Flow" in the Journal

00:46:43.990 --> 00:46:47.080
of Atmospheric Sciences, which
laid down the foundations

00:46:47.080 --> 00:46:50.930
for an entire branch of
mathematics called Chaos Theory,

00:46:50.930 --> 00:46:53.370
chaos systems are being
and that they start off

00:46:53.370 --> 00:46:54.970
quite predictable.

00:46:54.970 --> 00:46:57.330
After a certain amount of time
though they Saturday to behave

00:46:57.330 --> 00:46:59.150
in a way which for
a lot of intents

00:46:59.150 --> 00:47:01.690
and purposes resembles
randomness,

00:47:01.690 --> 00:47:05.230
this is why weather forecasters
can only predict the weather ten

00:47:05.230 --> 00:47:06.530
days out.

00:47:06.530 --> 00:47:10.760
One of the things that
define the chaotic system is

00:47:10.760 --> 00:47:13.410
that it's particularly
sensitive to initial conditions.

00:47:13.410 --> 00:47:16.570
That is, the state of the system
when it starts has a huge effect

00:47:16.570 --> 00:47:19.080
on how it will behave
long into the future.

00:47:19.080 --> 00:47:21.960
This idea that these
extraordinary, elaborate,

00:47:21.960 --> 00:47:25.250
mathematical structures could be
to dependant on minute changes

00:47:25.250 --> 00:47:28.150
in their state, right at the
beginning eventually gave rise

00:47:28.150 --> 00:47:30.330
to a famous term
that Lorenz coined,

00:47:30.330 --> 00:47:33.140
"The Butterfly Effect"
Lorenz's model,

00:47:33.140 --> 00:47:36.000
particularly The Lorenz
Attractor is a set

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:38.230
of three symboled
differential equations,

00:47:38.230 --> 00:47:41.220
there are three constants
called Sigma, Rho and Beta

00:47:41.220 --> 00:47:43.690
which define those that
delicate initial conditions

00:47:43.690 --> 00:47:45.220
that we spoke about.

00:47:45.220 --> 00:47:47.070
By changing the values
of these numbers,

00:47:47.070 --> 00:47:50.400
the system can now put a vast
monastery on strange geometries,

00:47:50.400 --> 00:47:54.230
from tight spirals to messy
tangles of loops and curls.

00:47:54.230 --> 00:48:00.410
Set to a very particular set
of values, 28/10 and 8 over 3,

00:48:00.410 --> 00:48:02.360
the Lorenz Attractor
outputs a structure

00:48:02.360 --> 00:48:04.450
which anyone would
have to admit,

00:48:04.450 --> 00:48:06.880
looks an awful lot
like a butterfly.

00:48:06.880 --> 00:48:08.820
It's when we watch that
butterfly emerge though

00:48:08.820 --> 00:48:11.100
by setting the system
free to animate over time

00:48:11.100 --> 00:48:14.350
that we get a real sense of the
beauty of the Lorenz Attractor.

00:48:14.350 --> 00:48:17.520
We see how it lives through
long periods of regularity

00:48:17.520 --> 00:48:21.030
where we start to recognize
a pattern only to seemingly

00:48:21.030 --> 00:48:24.950
at random to switch
course or change direction.

00:48:24.950 --> 00:48:28.600
Joel? Can you tell us what the
Lorenz Attractor looks like?

00:48:28.600 --> 00:48:30.450
&gt;&gt; Joel Snyder: Sure.

00:48:30.450 --> 00:48:37.540
This image features swirls
of lines or is it one line,

00:48:37.540 --> 00:48:42.960
that turns and curves in two
connected parts, each comprised

00:48:42.960 --> 00:48:47.370
of oval shapes enlarging
from a core

00:48:47.370 --> 00:48:50.930
into the arched collection
of swirls.

00:48:50.930 --> 00:48:54.350
At left, it leans to the
left while the right series

00:48:54.350 --> 00:48:57.740
of ovals leans to the right.

00:48:57.740 --> 00:49:05.860
Overall, two angled and
mincing eyes or a stark,

00:49:05.860 --> 00:49:08.410
colorless butterfly on the wing.

00:49:08.410 --> 00:49:11.900
&gt;&gt; Joel Thorp: My third and last
guest today is Kathleen O'Neil

00:49:11.900 --> 00:49:13.200
archive specialist

00:49:13.200 --> 00:49:14.970
in the manuscript division
here at the library.

00:49:14.970 --> 00:49:16.270
Hi, Kathleen.

00:49:16.270 --> 00:49:17.570
&gt;&gt; Kathleen O'Neil: Hi.

00:49:17.570 --> 00:49:18.970
&gt;&gt; Joel Thorp: Welcome to
the Artists in the Archive.

00:49:18.970 --> 00:49:20.400
&gt;&gt; Kathleen O'Neil: Hi.

00:49:20.400 --> 00:49:23.160
&gt;&gt; Joel Thorp: So
Kathleen was one

00:49:23.160 --> 00:49:24.790
of the first people
I met at the library.

00:49:24.790 --> 00:49:28.280
I went on this grand
extraordinary tour

00:49:28.280 --> 00:49:31.650
of all the rooms and as many of
the collections as I can get to

00:49:31.650 --> 00:49:34.360
and the Kathleen showed
us the manuscript division

00:49:34.360 --> 00:49:35.920
and at the end of the
tour, sort of more

00:49:35.920 --> 00:49:37.450
or less offhand she said,

00:49:37.450 --> 00:49:42.860
over is the original Lorenz
Attractor software [laughter]

00:49:42.860 --> 00:49:46.250
and I being me was
like, let's go see it.

00:49:46.250 --> 00:49:51.140
And so we saw it, but maybe we
start by talking a little bit

00:49:51.140 --> 00:49:54.500
about the manuscript division,
what it holds, what have kinds

00:49:54.500 --> 00:49:56.450
of things belong in
the manuscript division

00:49:56.450 --> 00:49:59.440
and then we can move on
to the Lorenz collection.

00:49:59.440 --> 00:50:00.740
&gt;&gt; Kathleen O'Neil: Well,

00:50:00.740 --> 00:50:04.180
the manuscript division
collects the personal papers

00:50:04.180 --> 00:50:08.780
and organizational records of
people and organizations that

00:50:08.780 --> 00:50:11.030
and cultural significance
to the United States,

00:50:11.030 --> 00:50:13.650
where it's suppose to
document the cultural history,

00:50:13.650 --> 00:50:18.350
that means the political, art
science and the everyday lives

00:50:18.350 --> 00:50:19.760
of the American people.

00:50:19.760 --> 00:50:25.350
And we have over eleven thousand
collections some are small

00:50:25.350 --> 00:50:27.540
as a single item, others

00:50:27.540 --> 00:50:32.580
like the NAACP records
is millions of items.

00:50:32.580 --> 00:50:37.530
We mostly collect manuscripts,
but we do some 3D objects,

00:50:37.530 --> 00:50:43.310
we have photographs, we have
scrapbooks, there's an example

00:50:43.310 --> 00:50:47.010
of almost any type of material
that you could find and now

00:50:47.010 --> 00:50:50.280
as we are collecting these
more modern collections,

00:50:50.280 --> 00:50:52.420
we're getting born
digital materials.

00:50:52.420 --> 00:50:54.740
So that's our new frontier.

00:50:54.740 --> 00:50:57.370
&gt;&gt; Jer Thorp: If you look on
the libraries Wikipedia page

00:50:57.370 --> 00:50:59.570
or anywhere else, they'll
give you numbers for all

00:50:59.570 --> 00:51:02.540
of the other departments about
how much they hold and then

00:51:02.540 --> 00:51:05.620
for the manuscripts departments
there's like seriously lots,

00:51:05.620 --> 00:51:08.960
that's, that's how much it
has because, like, almost

00:51:08.960 --> 00:51:11.910
&gt;&gt; Kathleen O'Neil: Well,
they say seventy million items

00:51:11.910 --> 00:51:13.910
but of course, it depends
on how you count an item.

00:51:13.910 --> 00:51:15.210
&gt;&gt; Jer Thorp: Right.

00:51:15.210 --> 00:51:18.810
And you have some items on your
lap and we'll talk about this

00:51:18.810 --> 00:51:21.940
in a moment, but you
processed this particular help

00:51:21.940 --> 00:51:23.850
to process this particular
collection.

00:51:23.850 --> 00:51:25.600
&gt;&gt; Kathleen O'Neil: I processed
the born digital materials,

00:51:25.600 --> 00:51:29.580
but the Lorenz collection came
to the library in about 2008,

00:51:29.580 --> 00:51:32.820
2009 and it was processed by
Joseph Brooks an archivist

00:51:32.820 --> 00:51:36.150
in the manuscript division,
he processed the paper

00:51:36.150 --> 00:51:37.890
and paper portion
of the collection is

00:51:37.890 --> 00:51:41.930
about fifteen thousand items
it's forty four hundred boxes

00:51:41.930 --> 00:51:44.380
and twelve oversized boxes,

00:51:44.380 --> 00:51:46.780
which for the manuscript
division is a relatively small

00:51:46.780 --> 00:51:52.830
collection, but the born
digital materials that came

00:51:52.830 --> 00:51:59.160
in included a CPU, an eight
inch floppy a couple of five

00:51:59.160 --> 00:52:02.130
and a quarter inch floppy,
three and a half inch floppy,

00:52:02.130 --> 00:52:05.390
and some optical disks; and
at the time when they came

00:52:05.390 --> 00:52:08.640
in we didn't have
the tools we needed

00:52:08.640 --> 00:52:12.770
to process those materials
but in the last several years

00:52:12.770 --> 00:52:14.440
and this is one of
the things that I love

00:52:14.440 --> 00:52:15.740
about this collection, is

00:52:15.740 --> 00:52:19.070
that sometimes you have these
collections that draw you

00:52:19.070 --> 00:52:22.450
out into the library where you
get to draw in the expertise

00:52:22.450 --> 00:52:26.220
of other divisions
and other people

00:52:26.220 --> 00:52:32.190
and the preservation has been
developing a forensic station

00:52:32.190 --> 00:52:36.070
down in preservation and Amanda
May who has saved my life more

00:52:36.070 --> 00:52:40.620
than once, I've developed a
work flow to recover to five

00:52:40.620 --> 00:52:42.230
and a quarter inch floppies.

00:52:42.230 --> 00:52:46.260
So at that point, which was
about a year or two ago,

00:52:46.260 --> 00:52:49.500
we felt we were ready to
tackle the CPU and the five

00:52:49.500 --> 00:52:52.030
and a quarter inch floppy, the
eight inch floppy will have

00:52:52.030 --> 00:52:55.180
to wait for another day and
so that's why we decided

00:52:55.180 --> 00:52:57.350
to process it last year.

00:52:57.350 --> 00:53:01.290
&gt;&gt; Jer Thorp: We are going
to use some real software

00:53:01.290 --> 00:53:06.270
from the 1980s and '70s
momentarily but we're going

00:53:06.270 --> 00:53:08.930
to get there in a minute.

00:53:08.930 --> 00:53:10.230
&gt;&gt; Kathleen O'Neil: Okay.

00:53:10.230 --> 00:53:12.410
&gt;&gt; Jer Thorp: The manuscript
division is just not only kind a

00:53:12.410 --> 00:53:16.580
record of history itself,
but I think it also is it's

00:53:16.580 --> 00:53:18.950
like the [inaudible] thing
around history in this case,

00:53:18.950 --> 00:53:23.810
we have a collection
which starts near

00:53:23.810 --> 00:53:26.020
or before the beginning
of computation,

00:53:26.020 --> 00:53:31.230
of modern computation
and that ends very,

00:53:31.230 --> 00:53:34.520
very much in the
modern computational era

00:53:34.520 --> 00:53:37.340
and the reason why I
didn't show you a picture

00:53:37.340 --> 00:53:40.060
when Joel described
the Lorenz Attractor is

00:53:40.060 --> 00:53:43.560
because this is how it
existed in Edward Lorenz's head

00:53:43.560 --> 00:53:47.050
in the beginning because the
computation power was not

00:53:47.050 --> 00:53:48.840
available to rendered it.

00:53:48.840 --> 00:53:51.700
Can you show us the
first diagram?

00:53:51.700 --> 00:53:55.060
Yeah. This one, we'll
start with this one.

00:53:55.060 --> 00:53:59.590
And to give a sense of what
that process would have looked

00:53:59.590 --> 00:54:03.810
like on stage, and we'll post
this image to the finding aid,

00:54:03.810 --> 00:54:05.900
is a piece of graph
paper, right?

00:54:05.900 --> 00:54:10.280
Yeah it's got marks on it in
pencil and so you can image

00:54:10.280 --> 00:54:13.000
that this grand idea, which
we'll talk in a second

00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:16.030
about how this came up because
I think it's really fascinating.

00:54:16.030 --> 00:54:20.410
Would have emerged not as a
whole, but as small fragments

00:54:20.410 --> 00:54:24.100
over a course of
years and decades.

00:54:24.100 --> 00:54:25.400
&gt;&gt; Kathleen O'Neil: Yeah.

00:54:25.400 --> 00:54:26.700
I mean, I think the
thing that struck me is

00:54:26.700 --> 00:54:29.920
because as I processed the born
digital I didn't ignore the

00:54:29.920 --> 00:54:32.150
paper, I needed to
look at the paper

00:54:32.150 --> 00:54:34.820
so I could understand the
relationship between the two

00:54:34.820 --> 00:54:36.150
and a lot of times
it was the paper

00:54:36.150 --> 00:54:39.990
that told me what the born
digital materials were,

00:54:39.990 --> 00:54:44.390
but with how handmade
everything is

00:54:44.390 --> 00:54:47.490
and the labor of
scientific work.

00:54:47.490 --> 00:54:54.420
Which is so clear when you see
these all these tiny little dots

00:54:54.420 --> 00:54:57.440
that needed to be
plotted and later, I mean,

00:54:57.440 --> 00:55:01.860
we talked about this there's,
you know, they've just run

00:55:01.860 --> 00:55:04.980
out of room the graph
paper it's not big enough

00:55:04.980 --> 00:55:08.990
&gt;&gt; Jer Thorp: That second image
because this is a great example

00:55:08.990 --> 00:55:14.180
of that where Lorenz begins to
plot, perhaps the first plot

00:55:14.180 --> 00:55:17.110
of the attractor only to realize

00:55:17.110 --> 00:55:19.610
that he's run out
of graph paper.

00:55:19.610 --> 00:55:20.910
&gt;&gt; Kathleen O'Neil: Yeah.

00:55:20.910 --> 00:55:25.350
So that's whoops, I
have it turned wrong.

00:55:25.350 --> 00:55:31.250
That's half of it and so
there's lots of graph paper

00:55:31.250 --> 00:55:34.440
and also here's another
I'll just hold this one up,

00:55:34.440 --> 00:55:37.310
this is sort of an
expanded version of that

00:55:37.310 --> 00:55:40.750
and so there's dozens of these
and so if you were really smart

00:55:40.750 --> 00:55:42.900
and knew what you were
doing, you could lay them

00:55:42.900 --> 00:55:44.630
out on the floor
like a jigsaw puzzle

00:55:44.630 --> 00:55:47.070
or a [inaudible] can
put them together

00:55:47.070 --> 00:55:52.630
but the front should I show the

00:55:52.630 --> 00:55:53.930
&gt;&gt; Jer Thorp: Not yet.

00:55:53.930 --> 00:55:55.230
&gt;&gt; Kathleen O'Neil: Not yet.

00:55:55.230 --> 00:55:56.530
Okay.

00:55:56.530 --> 00:55:57.830
&gt;&gt; Jer Thorp: Let's
save that for the end

00:55:57.830 --> 00:55:59.900
and I'll do maybe a
poor man's Joel here

00:55:59.900 --> 00:56:04.020
and say what we're looking
is kind of an 8 1/2x11 piece

00:56:04.020 --> 00:56:08.500
of green line graph paper and
on are penciled but also blue

00:56:08.500 --> 00:56:12.650
and red ink lines something that
to my mind represents that kind

00:56:12.650 --> 00:56:15.530
of like curl inside
of a snail shell,

00:56:15.530 --> 00:56:18.560
it's kind of this little
piece of mathematics

00:56:18.560 --> 00:56:23.410
which to Lorenz would have been
real proof of something that,

00:56:23.410 --> 00:56:27.430
again, more or less he would
have had to hold in his mind.

00:56:27.430 --> 00:56:31.440
The Lorenz Attractor itself,
which we'll show in a second,

00:56:31.440 --> 00:56:33.110
was born of convince, right?

00:56:33.110 --> 00:56:34.410
&gt;&gt; Kathleen O'Neil: Yes.

00:56:34.410 --> 00:56:35.710
&gt;&gt; Jer Thorp: Can you
tell us the story?

00:56:35.710 --> 00:56:37.070
&gt;&gt; Kathleen O'Neil: Well the
story that he tells in his book,

00:56:37.070 --> 00:56:42.040
"The Essence of Chaos" is he
was running a series of data

00:56:42.040 --> 00:56:47.830
and the data had gone out to
six decimal points and which

00:56:47.830 --> 00:56:50.640
because he wanted the
numbers to lineup and not kick

00:56:50.640 --> 00:56:54.200
down to the next line on the
printout, he rounded them

00:56:54.200 --> 00:57:00.430
to three decimal points and I
should say this computer took

00:57:00.430 --> 00:57:03.930
up half of his office,
it was incredibly nosey,

00:57:03.930 --> 00:57:06.100
just the computer
not even the printer.

00:57:06.100 --> 00:57:07.400
&gt;&gt; Jer Thorp: Yeah.

00:57:07.400 --> 00:57:08.800
&gt;&gt; Kathleen O'Neil: And the
printer was one of those if any

00:57:08.800 --> 00:57:12.740
of you remember and I do, those
old printers with the sprockets

00:57:12.740 --> 00:57:15.030
that you had pull the
sides of the computer,

00:57:15.030 --> 00:57:18.050
you know, what is the word?

00:57:18.050 --> 00:57:22.280
Not serrated, but you know
what I mean, but thank you off

00:57:22.280 --> 00:57:24.680
when you were done that
was incredibly loud.

00:57:24.680 --> 00:57:28.880
So he goes and gets a cup
of coffee and comes back

00:57:28.880 --> 00:57:33.510
and he realizes he wants to run
another set of data and instead

00:57:33.510 --> 00:57:35.270
of inputting the
original numbers,

00:57:35.270 --> 00:57:39.630
he input the rounded numbers
and goes and gets another cup

00:57:39.630 --> 00:57:46.870
of coffee and he comes back and
he is surprised by what he sees

00:57:46.870 --> 00:57:49.740
because initially the
data tracks exactly

00:57:49.740 --> 00:57:52.110
with the first plotting
of the data,

00:57:52.110 --> 00:57:56.040
but as and I think he said it
takes about an hour or something

00:57:56.040 --> 00:58:01.200
to plot a day, as a time goes
on the data starts converging

00:58:01.200 --> 00:58:05.150
and it's not behaving in
the way he expected it to.

00:58:05.150 --> 00:58:07.660
&gt;&gt; Jer Thorp: This story
is mind blowing to me

00:58:07.660 --> 00:58:12.760
and so chaos is a
theory with a slow burn,

00:58:12.760 --> 00:58:18.250
this paper that I mentioned
earlier was only cited ten times

00:58:18.250 --> 00:58:20.850
in the following
decade by people outside

00:58:20.850 --> 00:58:22.250
of his particular field.

00:58:22.250 --> 00:58:26.650
So it was not an immediate
success, but to put in a framing

00:58:26.650 --> 00:58:29.770
which I think it deserves, it
is said this when we look back

00:58:29.770 --> 00:58:34.260
on the 20th century we will see
three great advances in math

00:58:34.260 --> 00:58:36.290
and physics those
being relatively,

00:58:36.290 --> 00:58:37.820
quantum mechanics and chaos.

00:58:37.820 --> 00:58:39.120
&gt;&gt; Kathleen O'Neil: Yes.

00:58:39.120 --> 00:58:40.660
&gt;&gt; Jer Thorp: So this thing
that came out of a trip

00:58:40.660 --> 00:58:45.890
to get a coffee and routing
error became something

00:58:45.890 --> 00:58:47.190
really amazing.

00:58:47.190 --> 00:58:48.490
&gt;&gt; Kathleen O'Neil: Yeah.

00:58:48.490 --> 00:58:49.930
I just to want say one thing,
I noticed I was looking

00:58:49.930 --> 00:58:55.130
through a new folder today in
preparation for today and much

00:58:55.130 --> 00:58:57.910
of the correspondence is people
writing to Lorenz saying,

00:58:57.910 --> 00:59:00.120
can I get a copy of your
paper it's out of print.

00:59:00.120 --> 00:59:01.420
&gt;&gt; Jer Thorp: Yeah.

00:59:01.420 --> 00:59:04.670
&gt;&gt; Kathleen O'Neil: And he
credits another scientist

00:59:04.670 --> 00:59:09.290
for handing out copies of his
papers to people for the spread

00:59:09.290 --> 00:59:13.580
of the idea and its
application in economics

00:59:13.580 --> 00:59:15.880
and physiology and other areas.

00:59:15.880 --> 00:59:17.180
&gt;&gt; Jer Thorp: Everywhere.

00:59:17.180 --> 00:59:18.480
&gt;&gt; Kathleen O'Neil: Yeah.

00:59:18.480 --> 00:59:19.780
&gt;&gt; Jer Thorp: And
actually, so we're going

00:59:19.780 --> 00:59:21.080
to show you some
software here and I think

00:59:21.080 --> 00:59:22.440
in almost all cases the software

00:59:22.440 --> 00:59:24.110
that we're showing you
is written by people

00:59:24.110 --> 00:59:25.940
who were interested
in the applications

00:59:25.940 --> 00:59:27.780
of Chaos Theory in
on their fields.

00:59:27.780 --> 00:59:29.080
&gt;&gt; Kathleen O'Neil: Yeah.

00:59:29.080 --> 00:59:31.140
&gt;&gt; Jer Thorp: So this first one

00:59:31.140 --> 00:59:34.990
that I think we'll show is
this software by Atlee Jackson

00:59:34.990 --> 00:59:36.980
at the Center for
Complex Systems Research

00:59:36.980 --> 00:59:41.970
at the [inaudible] Institute
and I'll show you a little bit

00:59:41.970 --> 00:59:45.480
about how this works and then
we can talk a little bit.

00:59:45.480 --> 00:59:47.390
So I'm going to ask
for the we'll have

00:59:47.390 --> 00:59:51.930
to use cap locks caps here,
Lorenz Attractor and I'm going

00:59:51.930 --> 00:59:53.760
to ask for an [inaudible] goal.

00:59:53.760 --> 00:59:56.440
Oh, is so exciting, isn't it?

00:59:56.440 --> 00:59:59.880
But now I have to enter in
some numbers which are sort

00:59:59.880 --> 01:00:03.110
of rough equivalence to what
I was talking about before

01:00:03.110 --> 01:00:06.300
where the initial conditions are
really going to change the way

01:00:06.300 --> 01:00:09.640
that this runs, but you've been
holding the Lorenz Attractor

01:00:09.640 --> 01:00:13.620
in your head and now we get
to see in it, in a what year,

01:00:13.620 --> 01:00:17.440
do you remember what year this
Atlee Jackson software was

01:00:17.440 --> 01:00:19.380
&gt;&gt; Kathleen O'Neil: You know
what, I have it on a piece

01:00:19.380 --> 01:00:22.360
of paper over there, I don't
remember off the top of my head,

01:00:22.360 --> 01:00:23.760
but I can tell you later.

01:00:23.760 --> 01:00:29.010
&gt;&gt; Jer Thorp: So the yellow
line is one that's going

01:00:29.010 --> 01:00:35.520
to render this, sort of,
classic Lorenz Attractor form

01:00:35.520 --> 01:00:38.570
and you'll notice that what
it does is kind of similar

01:00:38.570 --> 01:00:41.150
to what I was describing before
where it follows these kinds

01:00:41.150 --> 01:00:44.270
of periods where you think you
know what it's going to do next

01:00:44.270 --> 01:00:48.320
and then it does something that
you don't know it will do next,

01:00:48.320 --> 01:00:50.320
and I think there's an
important delineation

01:00:50.320 --> 01:00:52.050
to be made here been randomness

01:00:52.050 --> 01:00:55.580
and chaos the system is not
random, but it's chaotic.

01:00:55.580 --> 01:00:57.930
Which I think is a really
interesting division

01:00:57.930 --> 01:00:59.230
to make, right?

01:00:59.230 --> 01:01:02.320
If it were random this
computer couldn't simulate,

01:01:02.320 --> 01:01:05.570
but because it has these kind
of free equations striving it,

01:01:05.570 --> 01:01:08.940
it does continue, you know,

01:01:08.940 --> 01:01:10.910
we can run this essentially
forever,

01:01:10.910 --> 01:01:13.880
we'd be getting eventually this
really beautiful butterfly form

01:01:13.880 --> 01:01:15.180
that we're use to.

01:01:15.180 --> 01:01:17.500
&gt;&gt;Kathleen O'Neil:
I'm not going to speak

01:01:17.500 --> 01:01:20.860
to the mathematics of it.

01:01:20.860 --> 01:01:22.450
But, you know, my understanding

01:01:22.450 --> 01:01:24.630
of it is there wouldn't
be a butterfly

01:01:24.630 --> 01:01:25.930
if it was truly chaotic.

01:01:25.930 --> 01:01:27.230
&gt;&gt; Jer Thorp: Yeah.

01:01:27.230 --> 01:01:29.740
&gt;&gt; Kathleen O'Neil: Because the
image wouldn't recreate every

01:01:29.740 --> 01:01:35.270
time, you would have a
different image, but.

01:01:36.670 --> 01:01:39.470
&gt;&gt; Jer Thorp: So
here's another piece

01:01:39.470 --> 01:01:42.140
of software I don't
have the name of this

01:01:42.140 --> 01:01:44.560
&gt;&gt; Kathleen O'Neil: This
is actually my Mike Page

01:01:44.560 --> 01:01:47.610
and Jim [inaudible] who created

01:01:47.610 --> 01:01:53.390
for [inaudible] I hope I
pronounced his name correctly.

01:01:53.390 --> 01:01:54.690
&gt;&gt; Jer Thorp: All right.

01:01:54.690 --> 01:01:56.140
So I had this own all
quod up and I hope

01:01:56.140 --> 01:01:58.300
that this sound is going to
work, here otherwise I'm going

01:01:58.300 --> 01:02:03.530
to do some really good,
like, 1980s computer sounds

01:02:03.530 --> 01:02:05.970
for you all because
that's the kind of things

01:02:05.970 --> 01:02:07.270
that we're looking for here.

01:02:07.270 --> 01:02:13.700
I actually think I have to
drop out of full screen to get

01:02:21.340 --> 01:02:22.640
All right.

01:02:22.640 --> 01:02:23.940
So I've got to send
it, the insert key

01:02:23.940 --> 01:02:26.300
because I do not have an insert
see when I get to that point.

01:02:26.300 --> 01:02:28.420
Hang on one second to
I do not want to add,

01:02:28.420 --> 01:02:30.210
so chaos we're going
do the experiment,

01:02:30.210 --> 01:02:31.520
we're going to get some data.

01:02:31.520 --> 01:02:35.280
So I'm going to load this
data file, here's where I have

01:02:35.280 --> 01:02:38.720
to send it, the insert
key and it'll tell me

01:02:38.720 --> 01:02:41.400
which data sets I can
load, there's a little dock

01:02:41.400 --> 01:02:45.630
down MNA asked for this one,
KNH, chaos, we'll load that data

01:02:45.630 --> 01:02:51.280
and now I'm going
to go plot that data

01:02:51.280 --> 01:02:53.800
and I want plat speed
slow, the sound is on,

01:02:53.800 --> 01:02:56.140
think we're ready,
are you ready for it?

01:02:56.140 --> 01:02:58.200
Oh, come on people.

01:02:58.200 --> 01:03:00.250
Sound excited.

01:03:00.250 --> 01:03:01.550
All right.

01:03:01.550 --> 01:03:05.270
Let's do it.

01:03:05.270 --> 01:03:07.070
It's beeping, [laughter]

01:03:07.070 --> 01:03:10.130
[Video playing]

01:03:10.130 --> 01:03:13.830
You know it's easy, I think it's
easy for some of us to laugh

01:03:13.830 --> 01:03:16.630
when we look at this software,
but I think it's important

01:03:16.630 --> 01:03:19.950
to realize with this one
and for the one we saw last

01:03:19.950 --> 01:03:22.750
that for these mathematicians
and scientist this is

01:03:22.750 --> 01:03:25.790
in many cases the first time
they were seeing this thing,

01:03:25.790 --> 01:03:28.450
it was this first
confirmation of something

01:03:28.450 --> 01:03:32.110
that I think they must have
felt was something amazing

01:03:32.110 --> 01:03:36.490
and to see it or to hear it,
it must have been a revelation.

01:03:36.490 --> 01:03:38.040
&gt;&gt; Kathleen O'Neil: But
there's only a few letters

01:03:38.040 --> 01:03:41.120
that are associated with the
software in this collection,

01:03:41.120 --> 01:03:43.700
but the letters that
are you get that sense,

01:03:43.700 --> 01:03:46.230
like this is your data, you
know, you're writing to him,

01:03:46.230 --> 01:03:52.560
I created this to show your
data and Lorenz also said

01:03:52.560 --> 01:03:58.450
at one point that, you
know, it's the ability

01:03:58.450 --> 01:04:01.770
to change the variables, it's
not the initial computation

01:04:01.770 --> 01:04:03.550
that it's so difficult
they said, you know,

01:04:03.550 --> 01:04:05.660
people did these kind
of computations way back

01:04:05.660 --> 01:04:10.020
to the Greeks, it's the need
to do multiple variations on it

01:04:10.020 --> 01:04:11.760
and he said, I'd
probably would have given

01:04:11.760 --> 01:04:14.660
up without a computer.

01:04:14.660 --> 01:04:18.590
&gt;&gt; Jer Thorp: And actually,
the earliest software

01:04:18.590 --> 01:04:20.510
that we have we couldn't
get running.

01:04:20.510 --> 01:04:21.810
&gt;&gt; Kathleen O'Neil: Yeah.

01:04:21.810 --> 01:04:23.110
&gt;&gt; Jer Thorp: We tried our best.

01:04:23.110 --> 01:04:24.410
&gt;&gt; Kathleen O'Neil: That's 1986.

01:04:24.410 --> 01:04:25.710
&gt;&gt; Jer Thorp: But
the person who wrote

01:04:25.710 --> 01:04:27.010
that software actually speaks
to this so when he said,

01:04:27.010 --> 01:04:28.310
micro computers have been
a great boom to dynamics

01:04:28.310 --> 01:04:29.610
because they permit
the researcher

01:04:29.610 --> 01:04:31.660
to create a much more
flexible environment

01:04:31.660 --> 01:04:34.130
than is generally possible
with large computers,

01:04:34.130 --> 01:04:36.630
so here I think a
big benefit to see,

01:04:36.630 --> 01:04:38.540
what was happening
here compared to like

01:04:38.540 --> 01:04:40.680
that old room sized computer
that you were talking

01:04:40.680 --> 01:04:43.430
to was there was the flexibility
to, kind, of see these things

01:04:43.430 --> 01:04:48.330
over and over again and
actually, I was actually to this

01:04:48.330 --> 01:04:50.090
about to one of our
previous guests,

01:04:50.090 --> 01:04:53.250
John Hesler who reminded
me he is a topologist

01:04:53.250 --> 01:04:56.190
and a mathematician, that's
important that the we don't talk

01:04:56.190 --> 01:04:58.180
about Lorenz discovering
this thing

01:04:58.180 --> 01:05:00.130
because it already
was there, right?

01:05:00.130 --> 01:05:02.490
It was like these
[inaudible] for more or less

01:05:02.490 --> 01:05:06.390
on earth thing this'll
beautiful, magical thing

01:05:06.390 --> 01:05:11.060
that is core to the way
that this whole world works.

01:05:11.060 --> 01:05:14.100
Well, let's show one more
thing because it's the best.

01:05:14.100 --> 01:05:15.400
&gt;&gt; Kathleen O'Neil: Okay.

01:05:15.400 --> 01:05:16.700
&gt;&gt; Jer Thorp: And
sometimes I think by looking

01:05:16.700 --> 01:05:19.420
at the materials you get
some sense of the person,

01:05:19.420 --> 01:05:20.980
we heard this from
our last guest

01:05:20.980 --> 01:05:23.640
of F. Holland Day we can
look at those photographs

01:05:23.640 --> 01:05:25.720
and get some sense
of the person.

01:05:25.720 --> 01:05:30.270
That can sometimes be harder to
get from computational diagrams

01:05:30.270 --> 01:05:32.770
and from plots on graph paper,

01:05:32.770 --> 01:05:36.750
but we have something really
delightful that was part

01:05:36.750 --> 01:05:38.610
of the Lorenz collection.

01:05:38.610 --> 01:05:39.910
&gt;&gt; Kathleen O'Neil:
And I'm going

01:05:39.910 --> 01:05:43.570
to show the scientific
version of it first.

01:05:43.570 --> 01:05:47.970
So this is I'm not sure whether
this is the butterfly turned

01:05:47.970 --> 01:05:51.230
in a different angle or whether
there's different valuables

01:05:51.230 --> 01:05:55.220
happening here, but it clearly
to me it looks like a heart.

01:05:55.220 --> 01:05:59.150
And, again, this was one
of the delightful things

01:05:59.150 --> 01:06:01.280
about the handmade element

01:06:01.280 --> 01:06:08.260
of this collection is there's a
computer generated version of it

01:06:08.260 --> 01:06:10.770
and then down here,
I saw this and I was

01:06:10.770 --> 01:06:13.150
like why is it printing on
the right side of the paper?

01:06:13.150 --> 01:06:16.240
But on the bottom it says,
"I'm strangely attracted

01:06:16.240 --> 01:06:20.640
to you" [laughter] so he was
making a Valentine [laughter]

01:06:22.870 --> 01:06:25.380
or sending a message of
love perhaps to his wife,

01:06:25.380 --> 01:06:27.150
we don't know, but
it makes you wonder

01:06:27.150 --> 01:06:29.180
and that's what I love about it.

01:06:29.180 --> 01:06:30.480
&gt;&gt; Jer Thorp: Thank
you Kathleen.

01:06:30.480 --> 01:06:32.510
&gt;&gt; Kathleen O'Neil:
You're welcome.

01:06:32.510 --> 01:06:39.510
[Applauding]

01:06:39.510 --> 01:07:03.190
[Music]

01:07:03.190 --> 01:07:05.580
&gt;&gt; Jer Thorp: What part of high
school did math exist inside

01:07:05.580 --> 01:07:07.230
of Cartesian coordinates?

01:07:07.230 --> 01:07:10.820
X, Y and ZED, but the fact is
that math doesn't care about

01:07:10.820 --> 01:07:13.030
or four are made up axes.

01:07:13.030 --> 01:07:16.490
Indeed we can set up a Lorenz
Attractor inside any space we

01:07:16.490 --> 01:07:19.740
can imagine, real world
space or computational space,

01:07:19.740 --> 01:07:23.710
or emotional space, or flavor
space, or whatever we want.

01:07:23.710 --> 01:07:26.610
I want you to imagine for a
moment or the room you're in,

01:07:26.610 --> 01:07:29.630
or the bus, or the Subway
cars filled with words,

01:07:29.630 --> 01:07:33.600
every word in the English
language floating in space.

01:07:33.600 --> 01:07:36.390
Over there by the door is
the cluster of fruit words,

01:07:36.390 --> 01:07:39.150
pear and apple and
orange and cumquat.

01:07:39.150 --> 01:07:43.180
Right under your chair are
all the synonyms for love.

01:07:43.180 --> 01:07:46.220
Above your head are hope
and dreams and imagination.

01:07:46.220 --> 01:07:48.940
Proper announce are here
as well in dense clusters,

01:07:48.940 --> 01:07:50.600
the presidents are
over near the window.

01:07:50.600 --> 01:07:53.960
Just beside them are all
the countries and states

01:07:53.960 --> 01:07:55.910
and provinces and cities.

01:07:55.910 --> 01:07:58.020
There's New York in
the center of it all,

01:07:58.020 --> 01:07:59.410
hey I didn't write
the algorithm.

01:07:59.410 --> 01:08:03.180
If you look back at that
cluster of fruits by the door,

01:08:03.180 --> 01:08:06.760
you'll see that the apple has
been pulled closer to New York,

01:08:06.760 --> 01:08:10.260
drawn to it by so many
pop culture references.

01:08:10.260 --> 01:08:13.600
As an experiment I thought
I'd build the attractor

01:08:13.600 --> 01:08:15.380
in this word space
and see if the path

01:08:15.380 --> 01:08:18.010
of the butterfly could be used
to generate a series of words

01:08:18.010 --> 01:08:21.520
that might resemble some
sort of geometric poetry.

01:08:21.520 --> 01:08:24.320
So I used a corpus of three
million English language words

01:08:24.320 --> 01:08:25.620
and their relationships

01:08:25.620 --> 01:08:28.100
to create this three
dimensional map of language.

01:08:28.100 --> 01:08:29.850
I let the attractor
do its thing inside

01:08:29.850 --> 01:08:33.510
of this gigantic word cloud
and recorded the results.

01:08:33.510 --> 01:08:35.960
Now remember, these
attractors are very sensitive

01:08:35.960 --> 01:08:39.080
to initial conditions so making
small changes really affects the

01:08:39.080 --> 01:08:41.030
sculpture of their
attractor and thus,

01:08:41.030 --> 01:08:45.280
the kind of so called
poem that they output.

01:08:49.260 --> 01:08:59.210
So here is words space and word
space is a three dimensional

01:08:59.210 --> 01:09:02.880
object so on the screen in
front of me there's a cloud

01:09:02.880 --> 01:09:05.630
of points each representing
a word

01:09:05.630 --> 01:09:10.150
and these words are clustered as
in the example I've described,

01:09:10.150 --> 01:09:14.340
so certain related words will
be in one place so I can jump

01:09:14.340 --> 01:09:19.930
over maybe to series of words
that are somewhat related,

01:09:19.930 --> 01:09:23.460
there's balancing and
coordinate next to each other.

01:09:23.460 --> 01:09:28.900
I'm going to jump over to some
proper nouns like we described,

01:09:28.900 --> 01:09:33.170
there's Saskatchewan and Chaney
for some reason and Federer

01:09:33.170 --> 01:09:37.780
and then finally, I'll jump over
to this little narrow tendril

01:09:37.780 --> 01:09:40.940
of years which are
so often found next

01:09:40.940 --> 01:09:43.610
to each other in our texts.

01:09:43.610 --> 01:09:46.280
So what happens if we let
the Lorenz Attractor loose

01:09:46.280 --> 01:09:47.580
in this space?

01:09:47.580 --> 01:09:53.450
Well, we see our now familiar
butterfly shape appear

01:09:53.450 --> 01:09:59.290
and we can ask for that
butterfly to give us some poems.

01:09:59.290 --> 01:10:01.910
Now, with Robert in the
room I to want be careful

01:10:01.910 --> 01:10:05.880
that these are not in fact,
poems that they are structures

01:10:05.880 --> 01:10:09.100
of words which help us
maybe explore this vast

01:10:09.100 --> 01:10:14.330
and confusing space of language,
now, this particular poem,

01:10:14.330 --> 01:10:17.280
I'm not going to take a chance
to read it, but I will read

01:10:17.280 --> 01:10:25.350
to you a few of the outputs
that came out of this software.

01:10:25.350 --> 01:10:31.860
If I can find my notes amongst
this gigantic pile of things.

01:10:38.110 --> 01:10:42.450
This dynamic ride itself sounds
this variable declaration,

01:10:42.450 --> 01:10:46.510
this online spell it
sounds this online location.

01:10:46.510 --> 01:10:49.280

01:11:59.570 --> 01:12:03.130

competitive, competitive spell.

01:12:03.130 --> 01:12:05.990
Reply the symbolic

01:12:05.990 --> 01:12:09.080

these announcements
competitive, warring statements.

01:12:22.190 --> 01:12:26.500
Now, I should mention a little
bit about how this constructed

01:12:26.500 --> 01:12:28.920
because it is not in
fact, an exact random walk

01:12:28.920 --> 01:12:31.550
through Lorenz space,
well, let's take that back,

01:12:31.550 --> 01:12:34.980
it is but those words are then
sent through a poetic structure

01:12:34.980 --> 01:12:38.700
which we've assembled through
recording a particular poet,

01:12:38.700 --> 01:12:41.650
Robert can you guess
the structure?

01:12:41.650 --> 01:12:44.300
It was Walt Whitman it was
the structure of the that poem

01:12:44.300 --> 01:12:48.210
which I thought conducted
itself nicely to the kind

01:12:48.210 --> 01:12:51.970
of weird randomness
of it and again,

01:12:51.970 --> 01:12:54.610
I don't feel the these
things are themselves poets,

01:12:54.610 --> 01:12:56.710
but the way of using
the spirit of Whitman

01:12:56.710 --> 01:13:00.190
to explore this mathematical
space, this linguistic space

01:13:00.190 --> 01:13:05.860
in a way which we might find to
be interesting or intriguing.

01:13:05.860 --> 01:13:08.880
Now, as I mentioned, Kathleen
showed me the Lorenz Attractor

01:13:08.880 --> 01:13:11.460
on the first day of my residency
and since then it's been

01:13:11.460 --> 01:13:12.760
on the front of my mind.

01:13:12.760 --> 01:13:14.940
Overlaying all of the work
I've been doing as a kind

01:13:14.940 --> 01:13:17.790
of tenacious after image
as I'm approaching the end

01:13:17.790 --> 01:13:20.220
of my time here I hope that my
own creative path will have a

01:13:20.220 --> 01:13:22.550
lot in common with
the strange attractor.

01:13:22.550 --> 01:13:24.560
It may have started
in predictable space,

01:13:24.560 --> 01:13:27.630
following in expected pattern,
but now is the time I hope

01:13:27.630 --> 01:13:30.350
that it veers wildly into chaos.

01:13:30.350 --> 01:13:33.320
Now, push all those
words out of the room,

01:13:33.320 --> 01:13:36.360
[inaudible] out the windows,
sweep them down the drawn,

01:13:36.360 --> 01:13:39.380
push them out of the windows,
let's instead fill the room

01:13:39.380 --> 01:13:41.880
with everything the
library holds, all the maps,

01:13:41.880 --> 01:13:44.300
and manuscripts and obvious
and interviews and of course,

01:13:44.300 --> 01:13:49.150
books so many books; let's put
all the tweets in there too

01:13:49.150 --> 01:13:52.930
and website's and animated
gifts, like our words,

01:13:52.930 --> 01:13:54.830
these library things
are now organized

01:13:54.830 --> 01:13:57.650
by their relationships,
that big messy ball

01:13:57.650 --> 01:13:59.760
in the center is the civil war.

01:13:59.760 --> 01:14:02.650
F. Holland Day I think
we can all agree,

01:14:02.650 --> 01:14:04.180
is off in the corner somewhere.

01:14:04.180 --> 01:14:06.830
I've been thinking
a lot about how we

01:14:06.830 --> 01:14:09.650
as human navigate this
space, through the website

01:14:09.650 --> 01:14:12.570
or in person, in one of the
libraries reading rooms.

01:14:12.570 --> 01:14:14.580
If we plotted one
person's course

01:14:14.580 --> 01:14:16.410
through it space it
would almost always show

01:14:16.410 --> 01:14:20.980
up as one little point a densely
tangled knot occupying just one

01:14:20.980 --> 01:14:25.250
tiny little mote in vast galaxy
of information and that's

01:14:25.250 --> 01:14:28.170
because we come to the
library with something to find,

01:14:28.170 --> 01:14:30.350
we come to the library
with something to seek,

01:14:30.350 --> 01:14:33.280
our paths are nothing
like those elegant sweeps

01:14:33.280 --> 01:14:34.580
of the Lorenz Attractor.

01:14:34.580 --> 01:14:38.260
Now, I was born in 1975,
I got my first computer

01:14:38.260 --> 01:14:40.890
when I was nine, when I
went to the university

01:14:40.890 --> 01:14:45.160
in 1992 I taught Internet
classes in the library,

01:14:45.160 --> 01:14:47.650
there were two words that I
would use a lot back then,

01:14:47.650 --> 01:14:50.990
twenty five years ago, that
are earlier ever used at all

01:14:50.990 --> 01:14:54.990
when I we talk about the
internet these words are hyper

01:14:54.990 --> 01:14:56.290
and surf.

01:14:56.290 --> 01:14:59.120
The term hyper comes
from mathematics,

01:14:59.120 --> 01:15:02.110
it refers to an extension
a generalized a kind

01:15:02.110 --> 01:15:03.860
of radical opening.

01:15:03.860 --> 01:15:06.900
The word surfing comes,
well from surfing.

01:15:06.900 --> 01:15:09.750
To serve the web was to
be carried off by a force

01:15:09.750 --> 01:15:13.730
of curiosity not quite
sure when you're headed.

01:15:13.730 --> 01:15:18.440
So far in my residency I've made
abstract maps and strange clocks

01:15:18.440 --> 01:15:21.850
and wide color pallets, I
put together artist names

01:15:21.850 --> 01:15:24.220
and the invitation lists
for strange cocktail parties

01:15:24.220 --> 01:15:25.690
and I've turned the
Lorenz Attractor

01:15:25.690 --> 01:15:28.360
into a vehicles for
exploring text.

01:15:28.360 --> 01:15:30.500
All of those endeavors,
I think, have been trying

01:15:30.500 --> 01:15:34.170
to do the same thing,
to bring hyper back,

01:15:34.170 --> 01:15:37.520
to bring surfing back
to find nonlinear ways

01:15:37.520 --> 01:15:38.820
through this building

01:15:38.820 --> 01:15:41.910
and amongst all the wonderful
things that it holds.

01:15:41.910 --> 01:15:45.960
All these strange paths,
here for untrodden.

after the great Allied Bombing

01:15:58.460 --> 01:16:02.870
of October 1944, which
marked the last phase

01:16:02.870 --> 01:16:05.280
of German retreat from Greece.
