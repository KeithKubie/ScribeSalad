00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.000
&gt;&gt; Okay, cool. So we're back, I've seen this

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.520
before. We've made an object, this is good. we

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.010
have all these things, again, standard fields, custom fields,

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:11.100
what are these guys. Related lookup validation, all that.

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:14.520
&gt;&gt; So these are different things that we can build, mainly

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:18.810
business logic, around our attendee object. And so we'll go into more

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.770
of what this is later, but we'll be able to create

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:25.540
validation rules for making sure that we input good data, page layouts

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:29.260
for being able to modify how that form looks when we create a record. All

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:30.920
these different layouts, I mean, this is really

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:33.320
your one-stop shop for modifying your attendee object.

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:34.280
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:35.150
&gt;&gt; And at the very top, boom.

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:37.790
&gt;&gt; Oh yeah, we've got our tab. All right.

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:40.900
Cool. So we want to add a field, right?

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:42.680
&gt;&gt; Yes, let's add some fields.
