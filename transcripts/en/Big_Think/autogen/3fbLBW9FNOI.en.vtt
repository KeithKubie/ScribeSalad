didn't even have agriculture but they

then spread everyone in those land

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:58.049
then spread everyone in those land
 

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:00.229
then spread everyone in those land
masses so it's a double-edged sword

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239
masses so it's a double-edged sword
 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:02.990
masses so it's a double-edged sword
people are sources not just consumption

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.870
people are sources not just consumption
but of innovation
