First off, congratulations!

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.260
You've just started your first project in your portfolio.

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:10.880
And now for the answer, when I refresh the page you'll see that all of

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:14.470
the text in the description box turned red.

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:16.059
Okay, that was interesting.

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:17.980
And we've learned a little bit about style.

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:20.410
But let's remove this style from the file for

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:23.700
now because we don't actually want the text to be red.

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.010
It's pretty hard on the eyes.

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.430
Let's next talk about how CSS works and how to use it.
