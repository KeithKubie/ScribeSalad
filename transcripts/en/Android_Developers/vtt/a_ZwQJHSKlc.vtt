00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:06.120
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Good morning again everyone.

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:07.120
My name is Reto Meier.

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:08.120
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: And I'm Ian Ni-Lewis.

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:11.559
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: And it's time for the developers
at traveling planning and booking apps to

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:12.559
strike back.

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:15.240
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: You know, every week we spend
a lot of time talking about other people's

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.140
apps, not always nicely, so today's show is
a chance for the developers of the apps we

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:21.170
tore apart during the app clinic-

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:25.720
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: And put together again during
Android Design In Action, humpty dumpty style.

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.170
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: to give us a piece of their
mind.

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.470
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: In last week's App Clinic we
looked at these five travel planning apps.

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:35.020
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: We learned a few things, not
the least of which is, don't trust Daniel

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:36.370
Pham with the sound board.

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:38.780
Also, five apps is too many to review.

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.659
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: We also learned that people
found our featureless, black, void background

00:00:42.659 --> 00:00:44.330
too stark reminder of their own mortality.

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:46.680
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Right, did we have that featureless
black void or are we not doing that anymore

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:47.680
at all?

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:52.510
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: I think that, I don't know,
do we still have the featureless black background?

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:54.150
I think we're not doing that at all anymore.

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:55.280
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Okay, yeah.

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:56.651
I'll take the blame on that one.

00:00:56.651 --> 00:01:01.019
Our producers asked me to come up with something
that reflected who I was as a person and this

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:02.019
is what I came up with.

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:06.180
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: In terms of apps themselves,
we came up with the following prescriptions.

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.910
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: We want the apps to be consistent
with the design guide.

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:10.910
Don't we always want that?

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:12.200
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: We pretty much always want that.

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.200
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Indeed we do.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.211
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: In fact, that's why Roman keeps
dialing in to all of our shows, is just to

00:01:16.211 --> 00:01:18.860
make sure that we keep pounding on that dead
horse.

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:19.860
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Is that why?

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:20.860
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: I'm pretty sure.

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:21.980
It's not for the entertainment.

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:22.980
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: No, it's not.

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:26.070
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: We also wanna make sure that
these apps in particular are location aware.

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.690
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: We wanted them to integrate
with our digital life, you know, I use Gmail

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:36.790
and G Calendar for everything, other people
use, people use Facebook or different types

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:41.730
of things and integration with the things
that I use to organize my life is an absolute

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:42.730
must for travel apps.

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:45.370
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Absolutely, and, you know, as
far as that goes, we wanna make sure that

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:47.450
you can plan your entire trip using the same
app.

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.500
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Including all those damn guided
tours that my wife likes to go on.

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:52.500
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Absolutely.

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.000
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Buses full of Chinese people.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.000
[Laughter]

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.070
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: And finally, we wanna make sure
that we can complete the entire transaction

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:59.070
on the device.

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.720
So we don't wanna get thrown off to a website
or a web view, if at all possible we want

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:03.780
that to all happen.

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.490
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: And I should mention, just
in case I sounded racist, my wife is Chinese

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:08.840
and we take the Chinese tours, that's why.

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:09.840
[Laughter]

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:10.840
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: That makes a lot of sense.

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:11.840
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Right, exactly.

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:12.840
I didn't want that to sound bad.

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.360
Alright, so let's go ahead and take a look
at who we've got with us today.

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.420
We've got Goran Kukurin is it?

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:20.910
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: I hope so.

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:22.700
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: On the Worldscope Webcams.

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:29.230
Andrea Baccega of Fast Booking and Ryan Oldenberg
from Hipmunk who is joining us live in the

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:30.230
studio.

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:31.230
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Very exciting.

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.920
So he gets to see all of our disasters as
they happen in real time.

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.870
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: But he does not get to appear
on the table Princess Leah style as a hologram

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:40.900
even though we had that totally all set up
and ready to go.

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.260
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: It'll happen.

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:43.260
It's coming soon.

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.150
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: And then Reto's like "Oh,
but if we do that then I can't see my teleprompter

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:48.800
and how am I gonna read my awesome scripted
jokes?"

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:49.800
Whatever.

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:50.800
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Exactly.

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:51.800
It's just too hard.

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.380
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Let's go ahead now and look
at Worldscope Webcams.

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:54.670
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Alright.

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:59.130
So, let's start off by putting up on screen
the ratings that we gave this app.

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:02.760
We were a little harsh, mainly because this
app didn't do a lot of the things that the

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:03.760
other apps did.

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:04.760
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: We were a little unfair, actually.

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:05.790
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: It was totally unfair.

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:10.680
So I'm glad that Goran is here to tell us
just how unfair we were in person.

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:15.930
So, hopefully we've got Goran available on
the hangout.

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:19.470
If we can put him on screen as well that would
be awesome.

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:23.300
Nice, that's kind of a funky effect with that
background.

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:25.380
Hey, Goran, welcome to the show.

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.700
I see you've got a partner with you as well.

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:30.970
If you guys want to spend a little bit of
time, just introduce yourselves, tell us who

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:33.290
you are and a little bit about Worldwide Webcams.

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:35.780
&gt;&gt;Goran: Okay, Hi Reto.

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:46.520
My partner is actually my so, one of my two
sons who both was involved in developing the

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:48.020
Worldscope Webcams.

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:53.349
My background is; I was a computer engineer
long time ago.

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:55.140
I started with ZX Sinclair 81.

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:56.209
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Nice.

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:57.209
[Laughter]

00:03:57.209 --> 00:03:58.349
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: As did I.

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:07.710
&gt;&gt;Goran: Okay, but, now for years I work professionally
work in IT and development but everything

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:16.579
started when I received an Android phone for
my birthday two years ago.

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:24.690
And with local competition, Android development
competition, and then I decided to come back

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:28.500
and start to learn Android.

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:38.330
Java and C was already known to me but Java
and [unintelligible] was something new and,

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:45.300
together with my team, we started looking
for idea for developing profession.

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:55.520
We did some research on the web on other up
source and then we decided to develop Worldscope

00:04:55.520 --> 00:05:01.860
Webcams and in about one month of half time
working we're now straight time, Worldscope

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:03.139
was born.

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:14.150
It was version 1.0 and now, three years later,
we have almost half a million downloads and

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:27.069
we are looking forward to hearing feedback
from you, from Nick, from Roman and I think

00:05:27.069 --> 00:05:30.379
the new version will come in the next weeks.

00:05:30.379 --> 00:05:31.650
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Oh, very cool.

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:34.789
So you've got a new version queued up, ready
to go next week?

00:05:34.789 --> 00:05:35.860
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Excellent.

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:36.930
&gt;&gt;Goran: Next weeks.

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:38.360
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Next weeks.

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:41.520
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: That's a very important clarification.

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:42.520
That's really cool.

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:48.909
Now, I wanted to make sure that we got a chance
to bring Roman up because I know that, at

00:05:48.909 --> 00:05:54.490
one point, Worldscope Webcams was gonna be
one of the app Android Design In Action candidates

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:56.629
which I think got traded out at the last minute.

00:05:56.629 --> 00:06:01.259
So, I do hope that Roman's got some feedback
that he can share with these guys.

00:06:01.259 --> 00:06:02.559
You're up, Roman.

00:06:02.559 --> 00:06:05.020
&gt;&gt;Roman Nurik: Am I on the screen?

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:06.020
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: You are.

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:08.369
&gt;&gt;Roman Nurik: I guess I'm on the screen.

00:06:08.369 --> 00:06:14.409
So we actually, Nick and I provided Goran
some feedback, separately, on Google Plus.

00:06:14.409 --> 00:06:20.379
A bunch of the feedback is really around styling,
basic visual things.

00:06:20.379 --> 00:06:27.400
Like, one of the biggest points of ours was,
there's a case when you had the map, right,

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:31.860
you had the map in the background and then
images just kind of floating, I guess thumbnails

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:38.430
of the webcam floating over the map and it
didn't seem like there was a purpose, or it

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:43.789
didn't seem like there was a strong, kind
of, cue as to what was going on there so we

00:06:43.789 --> 00:06:47.669
had made some suggestions like maybe having
a background behind those images would give

00:06:47.669 --> 00:06:52.479
a feel of a swipeable surface where you can
go up and down, like, that's actually a list

00:06:52.479 --> 00:06:53.939
view.

00:06:53.939 --> 00:06:57.080
So we made a couple suggestions there, we
made a couple suggestions, like you guys said,

00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:00.789
around, I think it was last week in the App
Clinic you mentioned like around the search

00:07:00.789 --> 00:07:01.879
icon and things like that.

00:07:01.879 --> 00:07:07.050
So we made a couple suggestions, in general,
around visual styling and things like that.

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:08.050
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Cool.

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:12.659
&gt;&gt;Roman Nurik: But one of the reasons that
we made the switch at the last minute was

00:07:12.659 --> 00:07:18.060
that, I think it was just, you know, a little
easier for us to just think of how we can

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:25.580
redesign a trip advisor and Worldscope Webcams
is such a unique app that we can't just, you

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:30.500
know, jump in and redesign it for you, that's
part of the interesting problem of designing

00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:35.360
such a unique app is think of a way to be
unique and present the awesome amounts of

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:40.520
content you have, you know, the thumbnails,
the maps and everything, in a unique way and

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:41.699
we didn't wanna do that for you.

00:07:41.699 --> 00:07:42.699
[Laughter]

00:07:42.699 --> 00:07:43.949
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Yeah because you didn't wanna
take away the magic, right?

00:07:43.949 --> 00:07:44.949
Not because it was too hard work.

00:07:44.949 --> 00:07:45.949
&gt;&gt;Roman Nurik: Yeah.

00:07:45.949 --> 00:07:46.949
[Laughter]

00:07:46.949 --> 00:07:47.949
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Cause Roman's a hard worker.

00:07:47.949 --> 00:07:48.949
&gt;&gt;Roman Nurik: Exactly.

00:07:48.949 --> 00:07:49.949
[Laughter]

00:07:49.949 --> 00:07:52.830
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: You know, one thing we said,
I remember, last week about Worldwide Webcams

00:07:52.830 --> 00:07:58.969
was is it seemed like it would work best in
conjunction with one of these other apps and

00:07:58.969 --> 00:08:03.509
I wouldn't wanna say make it a plugin on another
app because we dinged a lot of apps for having

00:08:03.509 --> 00:08:04.509
too many plug ins.

00:08:04.509 --> 00:08:05.509
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Yep.

00:08:05.509 --> 00:08:10.369
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: But this is one of those times
when I really wish we had a, you know, intent

00:08:10.369 --> 00:08:16.430
registry or something where you'd say any
travel apps that wants to use the Worldwide

00:08:16.430 --> 00:08:24.249
Webcams functionality could fire off an intent
and get that kind of additional trip planning

00:08:24.249 --> 00:08:25.249
feature.

00:08:25.249 --> 00:08:28.649
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Absolutely, Goran, is that something
that is already available in your app or is

00:08:28.649 --> 00:08:32.970
this something you'd consider doing so building
an intent that a third party app developer

00:08:32.970 --> 00:08:37.910
could use to launch your app and display webcam
for, you know, a particular location?

00:08:37.910 --> 00:08:41.530
&gt;&gt;Goran: Yes, actually it is.

00:08:41.530 --> 00:08:49.600
Worldscope webcams is reacting on geo intent
so when it receives coordinates then you will

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:53.250
get a list of webcams found near the specified
location.

00:08:53.250 --> 00:08:55.480
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: That's really cool.

00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:57.290
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yeah, that is great.

00:08:57.290 --> 00:08:58.290
Okay.

00:08:58.290 --> 00:08:59.750
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: I like that a lot.

00:08:59.750 --> 00:09:02.050
That's exactly the way that you should be
doing things like that.

00:09:02.050 --> 00:09:08.080
So, hopefully some of the other developers
building these travel booking apps will take

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:09.080
a look at that.

00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:11.580
In fact, I think we'll ask them as they come
up.

00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:12.890
Put them on the spot.

00:09:12.890 --> 00:09:13.890
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Indeed.

00:09:13.890 --> 00:09:14.890
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Very nice.

00:09:14.890 --> 00:09:20.690
So, one of the other comments that we made
that I recall was I think in terms of displaying

00:09:20.690 --> 00:09:23.970
the content, you know, you've got this rich
visual content, it's all about the pictures

00:09:23.970 --> 00:09:27.860
and I think one of the pieces of feedback
we had was to try and make that an even richer

00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:28.860
experience.

00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:32.460
So you've kind of got your full bleed images
with, you know, the descriptive text overlaying

00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:35.270
that to make it sort of more immersive.

00:09:35.270 --> 00:09:37.420
Is that something that you guys are considering?

00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:40.920
Like, in terms of your overall UI, are you
pretty happy with the direction it's going?

00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:45.310
Have you got any plans of making modifications
in that direction?

00:09:45.310 --> 00:09:54.240
&gt;&gt;Goran: You have to excuse me because our
sound is not perfect so I'm not sure I understood

00:09:54.240 --> 00:10:00.890
your question correctly but if you're talking
about your feedback from App Clinic, I totally

00:10:00.890 --> 00:10:04.040
agree with all, all, all, everything you said.

00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:08.050
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Goran: Especially, yeah, I mean as Nick

00:10:08.050 --> 00:10:15.760
said before that he decided to change in the
last minute so I decided not to do some things

00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:19.220
to be able to polish up in time.

00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:28.011
And he already told me some of those things,
he told me one of those is really to use the

00:10:28.011 --> 00:10:33.280
first application screen as a view pager so
you'll be able to swipe left and right but

00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:36.890
in that case I think I will leave the map
tab completely out and put it somewhere else.

00:10:36.890 --> 00:10:38.390
The question is, where?

00:10:38.390 --> 00:10:42.980
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Goran: I'm not sure where but the map tab

00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:52.940
is actually the core, core functionality when
you want to search for the webcams near a

00:10:52.940 --> 00:10:54.280
specified point.

00:10:54.280 --> 00:11:04.950
So, I think maybe to put a small search button
in the action bar which will then call the

00:11:04.950 --> 00:11:10.930
map screen and then work from the screen.

00:11:10.930 --> 00:11:15.380
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Very cool.

00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:22.880
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: I think we'd encourage you
not to switch the screen immediately when

00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:28.090
you bring up the search but once the user
is finished using the search then it's completely

00:11:28.090 --> 00:11:32.360
appropriate to bring up that map screen.

00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:33.360
Very cool.

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:37.010
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Definitely ping us when you
get another release done.

00:11:37.010 --> 00:11:38.010
Do let us know.

00:11:38.010 --> 00:11:42.280
We wanna make sure we go back to each of the
apps we've looked at and take a look at the

00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:43.890
improvements and changes over time.

00:11:43.890 --> 00:11:47.640
So, yeah, definitely looking forward to seeing
the updates when you've got them done.

00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:48.640
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Absolutely.

00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:49.960
Thanks a lot for being with us, Goran.

00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:50.960
&gt;&gt;Goran: Thanks!

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:52.320
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Alright.

00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:55.930
So, let's move on before we run entirely out
of time.

00:11:55.930 --> 00:11:58.030
I think we're up to Hipmunk, right?

00:11:58.030 --> 00:12:02.670
So, this is the prescriptions that we had
for Hipmunk if you wanna go through those

00:12:02.670 --> 00:12:05.730
and me and Ryan are gonna magically change
places in the background.

00:12:05.730 --> 00:12:06.730
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Absolutely.

00:12:06.730 --> 00:12:07.730
I totally wanna go through those.

00:12:07.730 --> 00:12:11.060
Let me find a place where I can read them.

00:12:11.060 --> 00:12:16.580
So we felt that Hipmunk scored pretty well
on design guide consistency but where it really

00:12:16.580 --> 00:12:20.910
shone was being location aware and integrating
with my digital life.

00:12:20.910 --> 00:12:22.750
So, let me introduce Ryan.

00:12:22.750 --> 00:12:28.630
He's here with us in the studio and, Ryan,
tell us a little bit about yourself and your

00:12:28.630 --> 00:12:29.630
company.

00:12:29.630 --> 00:12:30.630
&gt;&gt;Ryan: Sure, sure.

00:12:30.630 --> 00:12:33.970
So, Hipmunk's goal is basically to try and
take travel search which is something that

00:12:33.970 --> 00:12:37.360
everyone kind of has to do when they wanna
go on a fun trip but isn't, in and of itself,

00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:41.380
all the exciting or enjoyable of an experience
and really kind of improve it.

00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:44.620
And, especially, make it more mobile friendly.

00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:48.150
It tends to be a little information overload
and, so, what we've really tried to do is

00:12:48.150 --> 00:12:52.790
get a lot of information across in a very
visual way and the biggest thing that that's

00:12:52.790 --> 00:12:55.620
led for us is a lot of fans of the app.

00:12:55.620 --> 00:12:58.130
We've taken the Android design guidelines
very seriously.

00:12:58.130 --> 00:13:02.660
We haven't done it perfectly but I think everybody's
trying to find exactly how their brand and

00:13:02.660 --> 00:13:07.440
Android can really work together and, you
know, a little bit of harsh feedback is all

00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:11.600
it takes to get you to really look at something
in a new way and that flexibility ends up

00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:12.600
with a much better app.

00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:15.220
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: So, I wish we could show you
the app on screen.

00:13:15.220 --> 00:13:22.370
Today we had some issues with our MHL connector
which I'm sure many of you can sympathize

00:13:22.370 --> 00:13:23.370
with.

00:13:23.370 --> 00:13:24.370
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: But I've got the app in front

00:13:24.370 --> 00:13:25.370
of me.

00:13:25.370 --> 00:13:26.370
&gt;&gt;Ryan: Sure.

00:13:26.370 --> 00:13:28.170
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: and, Ryan, why don't you tell
us a little bit about, you know, what you

00:13:28.170 --> 00:13:29.310
could change if you could.

00:13:29.310 --> 00:13:33.190
&gt;&gt;Ryan: Okay, well, the first thing I definitely
agree with is that the home screen is kind

00:13:33.190 --> 00:13:36.210
of a dashboard, kind of a list and Android's
kind of moved away from that.

00:13:36.210 --> 00:13:41.780
The only thing that I'm afraid of if I give
this up is the, like, unavoidable knowledge

00:13:41.780 --> 00:13:44.920
a user has the moment they launch this app
of what this app can do.

00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:50.170
If you use a little picker on the left, which
I actually did do on tablets where this really

00:13:50.170 --> 00:13:54.380
was very awkward, I did, unfortunately, get
a couple of emails of people asking how to

00:13:54.380 --> 00:13:57.930
get from hotel search to flight search, which
I launched them into hotels at first.

00:13:57.930 --> 00:13:58.930
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Right.

00:13:58.930 --> 00:14:00.970
&gt;&gt;Ryan: So that's kind of made me a little
timid about it.

00:14:00.970 --> 00:14:05.810
What approach I'm thinking of taking is instead
of kind of getting rid of a screen like this,

00:14:05.810 --> 00:14:07.440
make it more useful of a screen.

00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:11.440
So instead of hiding the recent searches off
in flights or off in hotels, maybe I could

00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:14.570
put them right here in front so you could
pop right back where you were last time you

00:14:14.570 --> 00:14:15.570
launched the app.

00:14:15.570 --> 00:14:16.570
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Absolutely.

00:14:16.570 --> 00:14:20.700
This is really tough and I think we've, we've
had to deal with this a lot as we've switched

00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:26.300
from the old Gingerbread design guidelines
into the Ice Cream Sandwich world is a lot

00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:30.920
of these things are not discoverable on their
own but they become obvious over time.

00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:36.310
You know, the same way that it used to be
that any hyperlink on a website was, you know,

00:14:36.310 --> 00:14:42.041
underlined and in blue but it had a really
sharp "click me" attitude to it and now a

00:14:42.041 --> 00:14:45.970
lot of times you won't even see hyperlinks
differentiated until you hover over them because

00:14:45.970 --> 00:14:47.800
people know how they work.

00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:52.340
So we're hoping to get to the point that people
just know how left side navigation work and

00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:56.920
that's one of the reasons we harp on it but
you're absolutely right that adding more discoverability,

00:14:56.920 --> 00:15:00.920
especially for new users, is a great idea.

00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:06.780
I wanna go really quickly to Roman to see
if he's got any ideas of how you can make

00:15:06.780 --> 00:15:13.180
things discoverable without always presenting
the user with a dashboard as soon as they

00:15:13.180 --> 00:15:14.180
log in.

00:15:14.180 --> 00:15:15.180
&gt;&gt;Ryan: Sure.

00:15:15.180 --> 00:15:19.426
&gt;&gt;Roman Nurik: Yeah, so, I think the point
about, first of all just to talk a little

00:15:19.426 --> 00:15:23.930
bit about the dashboard, I think the point
that, Ryan, you're making about having like

00:15:23.930 --> 00:15:27.930
a more content rich dashboard, that's a good
start.

00:15:27.930 --> 00:15:33.910
I mean, that becomes less of a dashboard and
really more of a dashboard or true dashboard.

00:15:33.910 --> 00:15:41.430
I know that sounds weird but basically I think
that's kind of playing into what, actually

00:15:41.430 --> 00:15:46.164
I think one of the mock ups we did for Kayak
was like, instead of having, you know, instead

00:15:46.164 --> 00:15:53.050
of having a decision between hotels and flights,
actually show the users all this information

00:15:53.050 --> 00:15:56.240
in one place centered around the concept of
a trip.

00:15:56.240 --> 00:16:00.330
And that point, I mean, they don't have to
think about, you know, is there hotel functionality

00:16:00.330 --> 00:16:04.620
search, you know, flight functionality, you
know, they just think in the concept of, "Oh,

00:16:04.620 --> 00:16:07.960
I have a trip and here are the different things
I can do on my trip."

00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:14.430
But to talk a little bit about the discoverability,
this is something that users of newer devices

00:16:14.430 --> 00:16:16.120
are being trained on.

00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:21.290
So as soon as they launch maps, as soon as
they launch Gmail, they're learning, they're

00:16:21.290 --> 00:16:24.290
starting to understand what spinner navigation
is.

00:16:24.290 --> 00:16:30.990
So, while there are some users that may just
not ever touch that, we're doing a better

00:16:30.990 --> 00:16:32.279
job of training them.

00:16:32.279 --> 00:16:36.630
So, like Ian said, it's really great, over
time this will be less and less of a problem.

00:16:36.630 --> 00:16:42.760
But, I mean, in terms of other things, you
could have kind of a pop up, you know, kind

00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:47.200
of blue circles indicating, "Hey, there's
more stuff here" we don't recommend generally

00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:50.920
doing that because things like the action
bar spinner should be discoverable on their

00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:55.630
own but if you absolutely must direct attention
to something, you could do something like

00:16:55.630 --> 00:16:56.630
that.

00:16:56.630 --> 00:16:59.940
And I think we mentioned this last time but
there's an open source project called Showcase

00:16:59.940 --> 00:17:04.190
view that can kind of give you that rich,
you know, zoom in to a specific UI element.

00:17:04.190 --> 00:17:08.799
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: One thing we used to do in
video games that I think would be really difficult

00:17:08.799 --> 00:17:15.049
to do, like would be incredibly difficult
machine learning exercise but with a video

00:17:15.049 --> 00:17:18.539
game it was a lot easier, you could detect
when the user was frustrated and when they

00:17:18.539 --> 00:17:20.802
couldn't figure out how to pass the level
and give them hints.

00:17:20.802 --> 00:17:26.990
You know, I'd love it if you could say, "Oh,"
well okay, now I'm getting into clippy territory

00:17:26.990 --> 00:17:27.990
but-
[Laughter]

00:17:27.990 --> 00:17:31.500
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: "Obviously you're trying to
find hotel, it's up here!"

00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:37.910
Yeah, I like the task oriented view with the
idea that the navigation is something that

00:17:37.910 --> 00:17:43.470
would jump you ahead or behind with the task
without having to be the only way.

00:17:43.470 --> 00:17:47.999
&gt;&gt;Ryan: Yeah, to say something in less words
than the spinner, I am looking forward to

00:17:47.999 --> 00:17:50.299
the day that that is just the way UI works
on Android.

00:17:50.299 --> 00:17:52.090
I feel like that's a great way to do it.

00:17:52.090 --> 00:17:56.720
Dashboards, they were kind of a solution to
a problem that's now been solved better and

00:17:56.720 --> 00:17:59.429
we're just kind of waiting for the mainstream
to catch up a little bit.

00:17:59.429 --> 00:18:03.499
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Yeah, I think, it's been mentioned
a couple of times already but I think the

00:18:03.499 --> 00:18:08.210
solution which Roman's describing actually
fits in really well with one of your key points

00:18:08.210 --> 00:18:11.460
which was the ability to plan your entire
trip so you're kind of getting away from that,

00:18:11.460 --> 00:18:15.600
"I wanna plan a flight, I wanna book a hotel"
and you're just saying, "I wanna organize

00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:18.830
a trip" and there's a logical work flow that
goes there.

00:18:18.830 --> 00:18:22.639
So if you haven't done one of those elements
you're kind of prompted that, "Hey, you booked

00:18:22.639 --> 00:18:25.039
a hotel but how you gonna get there?"

00:18:25.039 --> 00:18:28.549
So, being able to sort of flow it that way
could be quite interesting particularly if

00:18:28.549 --> 00:18:31.830
you can have it enter, you should have a vector
that people wanna start with.

00:18:31.830 --> 00:18:35.619
&gt;&gt;Ryan: Yeah and then the sort of navigation
that doesn't feel like you go into something

00:18:35.619 --> 00:18:36.840
and come all the way back out.

00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:38.000
It's kind of a circle.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:39.000
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Exactly.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:40.649
&gt;&gt;Ryan: I think that could work really well.

00:18:40.649 --> 00:18:41.850
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Cool.

00:18:41.850 --> 00:18:43.450
Now, let's talk a little bit about this.

00:18:43.450 --> 00:18:44.450
&gt;&gt;Ryan: Yeah.

00:18:44.450 --> 00:18:45.450
My favorite part of the feedback.

00:18:45.450 --> 00:18:49.429
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Ryan: So, our location selector when you're

00:18:49.429 --> 00:18:52.740
trying to say where you're flying from or
where you're flying to has a pretty critical

00:18:52.740 --> 00:18:57.309
flaw in the current live version which is
that if the place you're trying to go isn't

00:18:57.309 --> 00:19:04.990
in our auto correct library and you hit the
done button on the keyboard, it actually nukes

00:19:04.990 --> 00:19:06.919
whatever you've typed out of existence.

00:19:06.919 --> 00:19:08.899
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Ryan: And this is just, you know, it's a

00:19:08.899 --> 00:19:14.139
perfect example of something I don't personally
do so I just never knew existed until I stared

00:19:14.139 --> 00:19:15.919
it right in the face in App Clinic.

00:19:15.919 --> 00:19:17.790
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Ryan: So that was like the best feedback

00:19:17.790 --> 00:19:20.840
I got because I'm sure there's more than one
person out there annoyed by that.

00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:21.840
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Right.

00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:25.499
This is where, for those of you who can't
see the phone, this is where I type in V-E-N-I,

00:19:25.499 --> 00:19:31.570
thinking about Venice, it gives me the choice
of either Venice, Florida or the Athens International

00:19:31.570 --> 00:19:33.870
Airport and, yes,

00:19:33.870 --> 00:19:42.110
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: I’m gonna try to be clever,
warning.

00:19:42.110 --> 00:19:43.110
[Laughter]

00:19:43.110 --> 00:19:52.279
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: So it'll either give me Venice,
Florida or the Athens International Airport

00:19:52.279 --> 00:19:56.159
and I think to myself, "Oh, neither one of
those is correct" so I hit done on the keyboard

00:19:56.159 --> 00:19:59.179
cause I just wanna keep typing and then it
nukes what I've typed in.

00:19:59.179 --> 00:20:01.240
&gt;&gt;Ryan: So this is actually an interesting
thing.

00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:02.730
I've since fixed that.

00:20:02.730 --> 00:20:05.669
I haven't released the update because there's
a few other things I wanna do to and I like

00:20:05.669 --> 00:20:06.669
to be not too annoying with my updates.

00:20:06.669 --> 00:20:14.070
But, the reason I do it is I found that when
I typed into one of these auto completes,

00:20:14.070 --> 00:20:17.821
I would type in "San Fran" and I'd say San
Francisco and I'd be like, "Oh, actually I

00:20:17.821 --> 00:20:21.919
didn't want that one I wanted South San Francisco"
arbitrary example, so, on the next click I

00:20:21.919 --> 00:20:26.989
nuke whatever was in there and then what you
would type would just pop up in a little hinter.

00:20:26.989 --> 00:20:30.399
The nice thing about that is you never have
to backspace like 30 characters you didn't

00:20:30.399 --> 00:20:32.070
want which is kind of, extremely annoying.

00:20:32.070 --> 00:20:33.070
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Right.

00:20:33.070 --> 00:20:36.590
&gt;&gt;Ryan: The downside of that is I didn't have
the case handled for that done on the keyboard

00:20:36.590 --> 00:20:41.409
so I was thinking you clicked on it again,
you gave it focus again by clicking on it

00:20:41.409 --> 00:20:42.970
so whatever you typed is gone.

00:20:42.970 --> 00:20:43.970
I've since fixed that.

00:20:43.970 --> 00:20:47.330
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: You know, I have to say I
think that you got a really good point there

00:20:47.330 --> 00:20:51.880
but I feel like there's more to it than that
because a lot of times, cause I've seen things

00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:58.179
that do behave the way that you're describing,
in fact, Chrome does this sometimes and it

00:20:58.179 --> 00:21:02.841
really just kills me, I feel like I'm typing
a certain and what I really want is something

00:21:02.841 --> 00:21:08.881
very similar to one that I've already searched
but not quite exactly the same so I want it

00:21:08.881 --> 00:21:12.090
to auto complete and then I want to be able
to change it slightly.

00:21:12.090 --> 00:21:14.409
&gt;&gt;Ryan: Chrome does that to me too.

00:21:14.409 --> 00:21:18.320
Like, if I search two words and then I go
back and wanna search just the first, I'll

00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:21.760
type the first and hit enter, it'll assume
I meant the whole two words and you're like,

00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:22.760
"No!

00:21:22.760 --> 00:21:24.090
That's not what I meant at all!"

00:21:24.090 --> 00:21:25.090
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Exactly.

00:21:25.090 --> 00:21:29.519
But I think we all loved your flight search
results page.

00:21:29.519 --> 00:21:32.739
&gt;&gt;Ryan: That's my favorite part of the app
and I think that's pretty true for everyone.

00:21:32.739 --> 00:21:37.200
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: And especially the way it
integrates with our calendar and the agony

00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:38.200
thing, that's awesome.

00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:39.309
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Although, I think I mentioned

00:21:39.309 --> 00:21:41.149
I really wanted more to it.

00:21:41.149 --> 00:21:42.190
&gt;&gt;Ryan: Yeah.

00:21:42.190 --> 00:21:48.419
So the balance we're trying to strike there
is, the best mobile apps tend to do like a

00:21:48.419 --> 00:21:53.690
core set of things and it's easy to like,
keep adding features as you finished some

00:21:53.690 --> 00:21:58.679
and you kind of have the dev time, or something
like that and, like, frequent flyer miles,

00:21:58.679 --> 00:22:03.149
you know, selecting preferred airlines and
all that stuff could be really cool to tuck

00:22:03.149 --> 00:22:08.549
in there somewhere but I don't know if I'm
entirely convinced that just keeping it very

00:22:08.549 --> 00:22:10.480
simple is the worst idea.

00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:14.650
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: I think you're absolutely
right but I would counter with, sort of, what's

00:22:14.650 --> 00:22:17.960
worked for us at Google which is you wanna
keep the interface very, very simple.

00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:23.400
I don't want anything to change in what I
just did but I wanna have that magical feeling

00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:28.799
of realizing, "Oh, hey, the results you gave
me fit my life perfectly because I don't just

00:22:28.799 --> 00:22:29.950
have a calendar.

00:22:29.950 --> 00:22:35.090
I also tend to fly this airline or I want
a window seat or I've got this many frequent

00:22:35.090 --> 00:22:36.090
flyer miles."

00:22:36.090 --> 00:22:37.090
&gt;&gt;Ryan: You make a good point.

00:22:37.090 --> 00:22:42.460
The distinction between UI, like screen space
being taken up by something, an actual functionality,

00:22:42.460 --> 00:22:47.119
it is actually not unreasonable to think we
could add that in, sort of, a setting screen

00:22:47.119 --> 00:22:49.830
where you don't even have to know it exists,
it doesn't clutter anything to do with what's

00:22:49.830 --> 00:22:53.389
already been done but you can get the benefit
of it if you want it.

00:22:53.389 --> 00:22:54.389
That's pretty reasonable.

00:22:54.389 --> 00:22:55.389
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Absolutely.

00:22:55.389 --> 00:22:58.890
There are a few things, you know, for instance,
the agony of a particular flight goes down

00:22:58.890 --> 00:23:05.971
if this long layover happens to be in a place
with a really good frequent flyer club, for

00:23:05.971 --> 00:23:06.971
instance.

00:23:06.971 --> 00:23:07.971
&gt;&gt;Ryan: Yeah, definitely.

00:23:07.971 --> 00:23:10.139
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: But what are the color codings
mean?

00:23:10.139 --> 00:23:14.179
&gt;&gt;Ryan: So, colors are specifically chosen
to be, like you guys hit on it when you were

00:23:14.179 --> 00:23:15.860
talking in the App Clinic, it's to do with
airlines.

00:23:15.860 --> 00:23:20.470
So, Delta's blue, United, or Delta's orange,
United is blue and NA is like a light green.

00:23:20.470 --> 00:23:24.549
We tried to do it as true to the colors they
picked for their brand as possible.

00:23:24.549 --> 00:23:29.600
In truth, we could have done arbitrary colors
but since it was already gonna be kind of

00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:33.289
a rainbow we tried to give as much meaning
to it as possible.

00:23:33.289 --> 00:23:36.601
For most people who don't really care about
the names of the airline or the color of the

00:23:36.601 --> 00:23:39.539
airline it's just nicer looking than a whole
bunch of the same color.

00:23:39.539 --> 00:23:41.120
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: That's a really good point.

00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:45.950
I would love to see a feature where they're
separated by alliance because there's only

00:23:45.950 --> 00:23:48.429
like four alliances that make any difference
at all.

00:23:48.429 --> 00:23:51.250
&gt;&gt;Ryan: Yeah, well that's the, the biggest
thing is often people think that they want

00:23:51.250 --> 00:23:53.529
a preferred airline but really they want a
preferred alliance.

00:23:53.529 --> 00:23:54.529
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Absolutely.

00:23:54.529 --> 00:23:56.899
&gt;&gt;Ryan: So, stuff like that can really make
a difference.

00:23:56.899 --> 00:24:00.000
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yeah, I can see how you could
really change things around.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:05.029
Well, I think we're almost out of time but
let's just really quick talk about the hotel

00:24:05.029 --> 00:24:08.299
search which we thought was very similar in
a lot of ways to flight search.

00:24:08.299 --> 00:24:12.940
It felt like some things were missing, like
there weren't as many, I don't think you have

00:24:12.940 --> 00:24:14.580
the previous searches listed.

00:24:14.580 --> 00:24:15.580
&gt;&gt;Ryan: Yes.

00:24:15.580 --> 00:24:20.710
So I do have them in the background but the
big design goal when they originally designed

00:24:20.710 --> 00:24:25.380
hotels or what I call intels which is our
hotel search product, which is that you were

00:24:25.380 --> 00:24:29.059
always looking at the map, you never lost
this anchor, which you guys even picked up

00:24:29.059 --> 00:24:33.330
on in the App Clinic cause you couldn't really
get away from the map until you picked a hotel.

00:24:33.330 --> 00:24:38.249
The downside of that is there's not really
room to put a big list that needs a bunch

00:24:38.249 --> 00:24:39.249
of screen space.

00:24:39.249 --> 00:24:40.249
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Of course.

00:24:40.249 --> 00:24:43.259
&gt;&gt;Ryan: So, really it was just one of those
things we just kind of had to give up and

00:24:43.259 --> 00:24:47.220
what I like about potentially bringing a combined
list of recent searches to the dashboard is

00:24:47.220 --> 00:24:52.419
suddenly you haven't given up that recent
search list and I think that can make up for

00:24:52.419 --> 00:24:53.419
it.

00:24:53.419 --> 00:24:57.570
In general, flights is, flights and hotels
were both designed in two different eras so

00:24:57.570 --> 00:25:02.210
flights was originally designed back when
Gingerbread was the king and ICS didn't even

00:25:02.210 --> 00:25:06.500
exist and Honey Comb was just on tablets,
which I think it's always just on tablets,

00:25:06.500 --> 00:25:07.899
but just on early tablets.

00:25:07.899 --> 00:25:13.379
Then I did hotels before I had an ICS phone,
though I think it had been announced, so the

00:25:13.379 --> 00:25:16.919
flavor of the time is like very visible in
the design.

00:25:16.919 --> 00:25:21.330
Flights I've done a lot of work to bring up
to ICS, I'm moving over to doing that on hotels

00:25:21.330 --> 00:25:25.460
but that's why while there's an action bar
it's kind of not quite right and why there's

00:25:25.460 --> 00:25:29.630
two floating buttons on the bottom left as
opposed to a vertical action bar.

00:25:29.630 --> 00:25:35.629
At the time these things just didn't quite
exist for me and so, you know, just the flavor

00:25:35.629 --> 00:25:36.629
of the time.

00:25:36.629 --> 00:25:37.629
But I look forward to fixing it.

00:25:37.629 --> 00:25:38.629
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Awesome.

00:25:38.629 --> 00:25:41.980
Well, I think that given what you've told
us about when it was designed I think you've

00:25:41.980 --> 00:25:43.200
done a fantastic job.

00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:45.679
I really appreciate you coming in, thanks
a lot.

00:25:45.679 --> 00:25:46.679
&gt;&gt;Ryan: No, definitely.

00:25:46.679 --> 00:25:47.679
It's been great.

00:25:47.679 --> 00:25:54.460
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Why don't we bring Reto back
up here and let's talk about our very last

00:25:54.460 --> 00:25:55.869
app which I think is KAYAK.

00:25:55.869 --> 00:25:59.499
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Well, actually, we kept them
in the same order as last time so just in

00:25:59.499 --> 00:26:00.499
case,

00:26:00.499 --> 00:26:01.499
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: We're mentioning KAYAK.

00:26:01.499 --> 00:26:02.499
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Exactly.

00:26:02.499 --> 00:26:06.399
Just in the off chance that one of the KAYAK
folks stopped in while we were on air and

00:26:06.399 --> 00:26:07.759
they haven't as far as I know.

00:26:07.759 --> 00:26:13.030
So we're gonna skip past KAYAK and, instead,
I think we're gonna look at FastBooking which

00:26:13.030 --> 00:26:17.269
we have Andrea Baccega available on the hangout
on air for us.

00:26:17.269 --> 00:26:18.830
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Alright.

00:26:18.830 --> 00:26:19.830
Andrea.

00:26:19.830 --> 00:26:20.830
&gt;&gt;Andrea: Hey, how are you?

00:26:20.830 --> 00:26:21.830
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Very good.

00:26:21.830 --> 00:26:22.830
How are you?

00:26:22.830 --> 00:26:23.830
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Very good.

00:26:23.830 --> 00:26:24.830
Thank you for joining us.

00:26:24.830 --> 00:26:27.619
What time is it in, I'm gonna go ahead and
presume you’re in Italy at the moment?

00:26:27.619 --> 00:26:29.889
&gt;&gt;Andrea: Yes, I am in Italy.

00:26:29.889 --> 00:26:32.909
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Andrea: It's 10 after 9 right now.

00:26:32.909 --> 00:26:33.909
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: That's not so bad.

00:26:33.909 --> 00:26:35.239
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: That's a reasonable, that's
a reasonable time.

00:26:35.239 --> 00:26:36.999
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: So where are you located,
Andrea?

00:26:36.999 --> 00:26:37.999
&gt;&gt;Andrea: Sorry?

00:26:37.999 --> 00:26:39.720
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Where are you located?

00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:40.720
What city?

00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:43.970
&gt;&gt;Andrea: I am in Jesolo which is a city near
Venice.

00:26:43.970 --> 00:26:47.869
It's about 30 kilometers from Venice.

00:26:47.869 --> 00:26:49.590
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Oh, quite close then.

00:26:49.590 --> 00:26:50.999
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Nice.

00:26:50.999 --> 00:26:55.509
So, yeah, so you developed FastBooking and,
in fact, we looked at your app because you

00:26:55.509 --> 00:27:01.580
pinged me and said, "Please, take a look at
FastBooking" so we did and I think we gave

00:27:01.580 --> 00:27:02.580
quite a bit of feedback.

00:27:02.580 --> 00:27:06.509
I think some of it was a little critical so
I really wanna give you the chance to tell

00:27:06.509 --> 00:27:12.320
us a little bit about the concept behind the
app, how happy are you with where it's at

00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:19.129
now and, sort of, what are your plans for
how you may want to improve it in the future?

00:27:19.129 --> 00:27:24.470
&gt;&gt;Andrea: Yeah, we decided to have a new version
of FastBooking application because we already

00:27:24.470 --> 00:27:31.429
had the ones before but it was designed a
couple of years back so the design was, well,

00:27:31.429 --> 00:27:40.539
it was okay at that time but now was outdated
so we decided to have a new revamped design

00:27:40.539 --> 00:27:42.299
that was right.

00:27:42.299 --> 00:27:44.639
So we did a new version of the application.

00:27:44.639 --> 00:27:48.159
We decided to have a flat design with flat
buttons.

00:27:48.159 --> 00:27:54.399
We decided to have the same color palette
that we have on the FastBooking.com website

00:27:54.399 --> 00:28:00.059
so, actually, the color scheme can change
because we have same colors on the website

00:28:00.059 --> 00:28:04.950
so we decided to have the color identity on
both products.

00:28:04.950 --> 00:28:07.520
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: That makes a lot of sense.

00:28:07.520 --> 00:28:11.010
Particularly for an app like this there's
a reasonable chance that you're gonna have

00:28:11.010 --> 00:28:15.619
people migrating from the web to the phone
and vice versa so having that consistent branding,

00:28:15.619 --> 00:28:17.309
I think, makes a lot of sense.

00:28:17.309 --> 00:28:24.489
&gt;&gt;Andrea: Yeah, so, we decided to have with
this application the new version and we, as

00:28:24.489 --> 00:28:27.590
I already said, we redesigned it from scratch.

00:28:27.590 --> 00:28:34.320
The basic features of the application is that
you can actually find hotels based on the

00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:41.229
check in date, the number of heads, the number
of nights and you can search for the city

00:28:41.229 --> 00:28:48.539
and then you can go forward and you can see
the reviews and the photo galleries for the

00:28:48.539 --> 00:28:51.009
pictures of the rooms and etcetera.

00:28:51.009 --> 00:28:52.009
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: That's right.

00:28:52.009 --> 00:28:55.600
That was the thing which we highlighted as
one of the real features of the app, I think,

00:28:55.600 --> 00:28:57.620
was the gallery with the rich photos.

00:28:57.620 --> 00:28:59.471
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: That's really useful, yeah.

00:28:59.471 --> 00:29:00.510
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: It looks really, really nice.

00:29:00.510 --> 00:29:01.830
&gt;&gt;Andrea: Yeah.

00:29:01.830 --> 00:29:07.909
So, and then you have, obviously, the ability
to book the hotel and actually also have the

00:29:07.909 --> 00:29:14.769
ability to bookmark one so if you decide to
bookmark it and review it later with your

00:29:14.769 --> 00:29:22.220
girlfriend to see if she wants to go there
and you can book it afterwards if you want.

00:29:22.220 --> 00:29:25.470
So it's actually only for hotels application.

00:29:25.470 --> 00:29:30.169
You, it's not like Hipmunk that does almost
everything in your trip.

00:29:30.169 --> 00:29:33.150
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Well, they're just showing off.

00:29:33.150 --> 00:29:35.280
&gt;&gt;Andrea: Well it's the-
[Laughter]

00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:39.509
&gt;&gt;Andrea: and that's it, I mean, we have a
number of things and I think it's interesting

00:29:39.509 --> 00:29:40.509
for developers.

00:29:40.509 --> 00:29:45.210
For example, we have on the booking form,
which is the booking page where you enter

00:29:45.210 --> 00:29:50.239
your personal data like first name, credit
card and the address, etcetera, in order to

00:29:50.239 --> 00:29:52.940
validate the booking process.

00:29:52.940 --> 00:30:02.090
You have a validation procedure that helps
the user understand where they failed to enter

00:30:02.090 --> 00:30:03.129
their data.

00:30:03.129 --> 00:30:08.090
For example, if they enter a number in first
name we're not saying you did it wrong we

00:30:08.090 --> 00:30:12.850
are going to say, "Enter the first name" or
edit text where you made a mistake.

00:30:12.850 --> 00:30:18.639
You did it wrong because there are numbers
in there that should be only alphabetical

00:30:18.639 --> 00:30:25.629
characters and this is a nice thing that we
didn't see in other application.

00:30:25.629 --> 00:30:32.899
But this is one of the most particular thing
that we created and we use a lot of catches

00:30:32.899 --> 00:30:38.350
in order to cache the thing that we download,
for example, the images that you get on the

00:30:38.350 --> 00:30:40.320
list are downloaded only once.

00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:46.309
So if you search menus for today and you go
tomorrow and you reopen application tomorrow,

00:30:46.309 --> 00:30:51.649
you are going to have the cached content instead
of reloading everything.

00:30:51.649 --> 00:30:57.690
We are going to cache the offers, the rooms,
everything, almost everything because we want

00:30:57.690 --> 00:30:59.809
you to have the application to move fast.

00:30:59.809 --> 00:31:01.460
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Cool.

00:31:01.460 --> 00:31:06.320
Yeah, I think that's a really key thing, particularly
on mobile which I think people who are used

00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:10.710
to developing on the web especially, don't
necessarily take as much advantage of because

00:31:10.710 --> 00:31:15.109
to them it's like, well, internet connections
will always be faster, the whole things not

00:31:15.109 --> 00:31:18.590
gonna work if you're not online so there's
not really the same opportunity.

00:31:18.590 --> 00:31:22.830
But, for mobile, doing that caching is vital,
you know, it's gonna cut down on your mobile

00:31:22.830 --> 00:31:26.409
traffic, it's gonna make the whole app just
feel faster and more responsive so I think

00:31:26.409 --> 00:31:27.409
it's a really important step.

00:31:27.409 --> 00:31:28.409
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Absolutely.

00:31:28.409 --> 00:31:31.419
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: And I love data validation that
tells you what you're doing wrong so thank

00:31:31.419 --> 00:31:32.419
you for that.

00:31:32.419 --> 00:31:33.419
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Oh yeah.

00:31:33.419 --> 00:31:34.419
[Laughter]

00:31:34.419 --> 00:31:35.899
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: I mean, there's nothing more
frustrating than hitting submit and you just

00:31:35.899 --> 00:31:41.850
get like, usually it's an alarm at the top
of the page which you won't scroll to, it's

00:31:41.850 --> 00:31:45.080
just nothing happens except some of the data
gets erased and if you scroll back up to the

00:31:45.080 --> 00:31:47.220
top it goes, "Yeah, you didn't fill in something
right."

00:31:47.220 --> 00:31:51.489
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Although I've gotta say it
seems like your discriminating against people

00:31:51.489 --> 00:31:53.450
whose first name do contain numbers.

00:31:53.450 --> 00:31:54.450
[Laughter]

00:31:54.450 --> 00:31:57.789
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Well, I think when you do change
your name so that the "I"is replaced with

00:31:57.789 --> 00:31:59.240
a "1" you're kind of asking for trouble.

00:31:59.240 --> 00:32:03.840
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yeah, but I am actually a
little sensitive to this because when I got

00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:10.149
married my wife and I decided to hyphenate
our last name and a lot of-

00:32:10.149 --> 00:32:11.710
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Oh they don't let you hyphenate.

00:32:11.710 --> 00:32:13.070
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: websites don't take the hyphen.

00:32:13.070 --> 00:32:14.070
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: That's kind of harsh.

00:32:14.070 --> 00:32:15.700
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: It's a little odd isn't it?

00:32:15.700 --> 00:32:16.700
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Are you sure?

00:32:16.700 --> 00:32:17.700
Maybe it's-

00:32:17.700 --> 00:32:18.700
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: There are quite a few hyphenated
last names.

00:32:18.700 --> 00:32:21.289
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Maybe it's just like generally
a keyboard only has like the minus sign which

00:32:21.289 --> 00:32:22.970
isn't like an EN dash.

00:32:22.970 --> 00:32:24.009
So, maybe that's the problem.

00:32:24.009 --> 00:32:25.429
You need to get a real dash.

00:32:25.429 --> 00:32:26.429
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: It's not a EN dash, it's an
N dash.

00:32:26.429 --> 00:32:28.010
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Well that's what, either way,
either way.

00:32:28.010 --> 00:32:29.010
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Okay.

00:32:29.010 --> 00:32:33.129
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: It's still a minus which isn't
the same as either, so.

00:32:33.129 --> 00:32:34.129
Try that next time.

00:32:34.129 --> 00:32:38.529
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: I have to assume, though,
that if I did that it would always print out

00:32:38.529 --> 00:32:40.450
as like backslash something.

00:32:40.450 --> 00:32:42.019
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Or like a, it could be a square.

00:32:42.019 --> 00:32:44.210
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Like the Microsoft quotes
that you see everywhere.

00:32:44.210 --> 00:32:49.549
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Oh, yeah, my favorite is on
word when it loses images it just has a big

00:32:49.549 --> 00:32:51.799
square with a red "X" through the middle.

00:32:51.799 --> 00:32:53.649
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yeah, that's rough.

00:32:53.649 --> 00:32:55.509
Anyway, something to think about.

00:32:55.509 --> 00:33:00.240
Yeah, we love the, we love the validation
that's a little bit more lightweight and user

00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:07.200
responsive, we love the caching, we just have
a few more seconds left to go, Andrea, but

00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:11.669
can you give us any ideas about what's coming
in your next release?

00:33:11.669 --> 00:33:19.140
&gt;&gt;Andrea: Well, in the next release we are
going to fix any minor bugs that we have,

00:33:19.140 --> 00:33:24.730
we are going to have a better Google integration
so we are going to check out the ecommerce,

00:33:24.730 --> 00:33:31.849
so we are going to know each transaction and
how much and where each transaction comes

00:33:31.849 --> 00:33:32.849
from.

00:33:32.849 --> 00:33:33.849
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Nice.

00:33:33.849 --> 00:33:38.440
&gt;&gt;Andrea: We are going to have a contact picker
so that the user will be able to fill the

00:33:38.440 --> 00:33:42.539
booking information so first name, last name,
the one that we talked about before, picking

00:33:42.539 --> 00:33:43.799
from their contact list.

00:33:43.799 --> 00:33:45.370
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Oh, that's good.

00:33:45.370 --> 00:33:53.549
&gt;&gt;Andrea: So if you have your own contact
with the address etcetera you can just pick

00:33:53.549 --> 00:33:56.729
your content and everything is already filled
for you.

00:33:56.729 --> 00:33:57.729
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: That's great.

00:33:57.729 --> 00:33:58.840
Anything that requires less input.

00:33:58.840 --> 00:34:03.279
&gt;&gt;Andrea: We are going to have multiple offers
which aren't currently available because you

00:34:03.279 --> 00:34:12.990
only are, in the lite version you currently
are able only to book the best offers, the

00:34:12.990 --> 00:34:18.790
best offer, only the best offer and now you
can choose between the multiple offers.

00:34:18.790 --> 00:34:26.190
For example, if you want to choose [unintelligible]
version, I guess, to the best one, you can

00:34:26.190 --> 00:34:30.280
just pay more and you can do it.

00:34:30.280 --> 00:34:31.280
[Laughter]

00:34:31.280 --> 00:34:34.380
&gt;&gt;Andrea: So that's the stuff that is going
on in the next release.

00:34:34.380 --> 00:34:35.419
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Very cool.

00:34:35.419 --> 00:34:38.830
And I have one more suggestion which I'd really
like to see you guys do because I'd like to

00:34:38.830 --> 00:34:40.020
see what kind of results you get.

00:34:40.020 --> 00:34:45.030
So, I think, from memory, yours was one of
the, one of if not the only app which didn't

00:34:45.030 --> 00:34:47.110
have a feature graphic for it.

00:34:47.110 --> 00:34:50.320
So when we put up the big screen of all of
the apps we were looking at, you know, we

00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:53.530
didn't get to do anything but have an icon
for you guys.

00:34:53.530 --> 00:34:58.390
So we saw a study on the web that showed that
one of the apps which was being featured found

00:34:58.390 --> 00:35:01.750
that their traffic doubled when they had a
feature graphic.

00:35:01.750 --> 00:35:02.750
Now,

00:35:02.750 --> 00:35:06.070
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: It wasn't just having one
it was also having a really good one.

00:35:06.070 --> 00:35:07.070
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: A really good one, that's right,
that's right.

00:35:07.070 --> 00:35:08.860
It has to have one to be featured to begin
with.

00:35:08.860 --> 00:35:13.570
So they went from kind of a "eh" graphic to
a really nice one and doubled their install

00:35:13.570 --> 00:35:14.570
rate.

00:35:14.570 --> 00:35:18.010
I'd be really interested to see if you guys
did something like that, create a feature

00:35:18.010 --> 00:35:21.980
graphic, try and make it as compelling and
interesting as possible and see if that has

00:35:21.980 --> 00:35:23.850
any impact on your downloads.

00:35:23.850 --> 00:35:27.850
I rather suspect that it will but it would
be great to find out from you guys whether

00:35:27.850 --> 00:35:29.950
or not my supposition is correct.

00:35:29.950 --> 00:35:33.850
&gt;&gt;Andrea: Well, we'll definitely do it.

00:35:33.850 --> 00:35:34.850
We will let you know.

00:35:34.850 --> 00:35:35.850
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Cool.

00:35:35.850 --> 00:35:36.850
I look forward to it.

00:35:36.850 --> 00:35:39.090
Alright, thank you very much for joining us
Andrea.

00:35:39.090 --> 00:35:40.540
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Keep in touch.

00:35:40.540 --> 00:35:41.540
&gt;&gt;Andrea: Thank you.

00:35:41.540 --> 00:35:46.100
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Okay, so, I don't the TripAdvisor
guys have stopped by so we've got their scores

00:35:46.100 --> 00:35:48.350
up on the screen, give them a couple seconds.

00:35:48.350 --> 00:35:49.350
Nope.

00:35:49.350 --> 00:35:53.440
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: So that, I think, puts us out

00:35:53.440 --> 00:35:54.440
of time for today.

00:35:54.440 --> 00:35:55.440
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Very much so, yes.

00:35:55.440 --> 00:35:57.090
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: So let's have a look.

00:35:57.090 --> 00:35:59.890
Let's give a bit of a shout out to stuff that
we've got coming up.

00:35:59.890 --> 00:36:02.150
So, next week's App Clinic we're looking at
video players.

00:36:02.150 --> 00:36:04.810
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Something near and dear to
my heart.

00:36:04.810 --> 00:36:05.940
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Indeed.

00:36:05.940 --> 00:36:11.930
So the four apps that we're looking at are,
in fact, going to be NX Player, Dice Player,

00:36:11.930 --> 00:36:16.220
Netflix and CDX Player and three of these
apps have something in common.

00:36:16.220 --> 00:36:17.550
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Indeed.

00:36:17.550 --> 00:36:19.510
They do not have a feature graphic.

00:36:19.510 --> 00:36:24.100
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: So we're really hoping that
if the developers of these apps happen to

00:36:24.100 --> 00:36:27.690
be watching or happen to catch this on YouTube,
that they go ahead and create feature graphics

00:36:27.690 --> 00:36:30.030
sometime between now and tomorrow afternoon.

00:36:30.030 --> 00:36:31.030
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Indeed.

00:36:31.030 --> 00:36:33.670
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Or we'll create them for them.

00:36:33.670 --> 00:36:34.670
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Excellent.

00:36:34.670 --> 00:36:35.670
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: How about that?

00:36:35.670 --> 00:36:36.670
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Fan drawn feature graphics.

00:36:36.670 --> 00:36:37.670
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yeah.

00:36:37.670 --> 00:36:38.670
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Should be fun.

00:36:38.670 --> 00:36:42.800
So this is gonna be tomorrow at a brand new
regular time of 10:30 AM Pacific Time.

00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:46.250
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yes, although I did want to
talk to you about that because I'm usually

00:36:46.250 --> 00:36:49.260
hungover then so we might wanna change.

00:36:49.260 --> 00:36:51.300
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Yeah, we'll have a look at it.

00:36:51.300 --> 00:36:56.330
In fact, you guys can let us know if, we used
to do this at like 1:00 in the afternoon which

00:36:56.330 --> 00:37:00.480
was, on a Friday afternoon, late enough to
not be suffering from a hangover, early enough

00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:01.730
to start working on the next one.

00:37:01.730 --> 00:37:02.730
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Right.

00:37:02.730 --> 00:37:03.730
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: So it kind of had its advantages.

00:37:03.730 --> 00:37:08.710
10:30 works a little better for our European
people who don't have to stay up late on a

00:37:08.710 --> 00:37:11.730
Friday night at home just to join us in a
hangout.

00:37:11.730 --> 00:37:12.730
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Indeed.

00:37:12.730 --> 00:37:14.960
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: But this is tomorrow so please
do tune in and hopefully we'll get some of

00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:19.990
these developers back next week for Developers
Strike Back as well.

00:37:19.990 --> 00:37:20.990
So that's all for us.

00:37:20.990 --> 00:37:21.990
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Absolutely.

00:37:21.990 --> 00:37:24.240
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Thank you for watching and thank
you very much to all of our developers who

00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:27.970
came in, both in the studio and via hangout
to talk a little bit about their apps.

00:37:27.970 --> 00:37:29.690
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Take care.

00:37:29.690 --> 00:37:31.360
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: And see you next week!
