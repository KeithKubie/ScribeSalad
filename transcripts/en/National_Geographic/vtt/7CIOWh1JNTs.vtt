00:00:00.633 --> 00:00:01.633
[mud squishing]

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:05.100
[groaning]

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:11.567
I've been watching out
so closely for predators

00:00:11.567 --> 00:00:13.867
that I run straight
into something else life

00:00:13.867 --> 00:00:17.166
threatening, quicksand.

00:00:17.166 --> 00:00:21.433
Actually, this is a--

00:00:21.433 --> 00:00:23.266
a little bit more
serious than I thought.

00:00:23.266 --> 00:00:26.600
[sputters] What
makes this dangerous

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:32.333
is, if you can't get anything
to grab onto to get yourself out

00:00:32.333 --> 00:00:38.233
of these situations,
with this hot sun

00:00:38.233 --> 00:00:40.300
you could die of sunstroke.

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.266
[panting and groaning]

00:00:44.934 --> 00:00:49.800
Fighting against it will
suck me deeper into the sand.

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:56.033
The way out is staying calm and
making only small movements.

00:00:56.033 --> 00:00:58.533
It's like loosening up concrete.

00:00:58.533 --> 00:01:02.033
[sighs] It's a very
strange feeling,

00:01:02.033 --> 00:01:05.033
getting water to
basically lubricate in

00:01:05.033 --> 00:01:07.133
between all the sand and mud.

00:01:07.133 --> 00:01:09.200
[grunting with effort]

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.500
Once I work my legs
to the surface,

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.600
I can pull myself out by
grabbing onto the side

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:18.400
and kicking.

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.367
[groaning and panting]

00:01:29.867 --> 00:01:32.667
Thankfully, one of my
cows didn't get in here.

00:01:32.667 --> 00:01:35.567
A huge, heavy cow,
you're not going to be

00:01:35.567 --> 00:01:37.467
able to get it out by yourself.

00:01:37.467 --> 00:01:39.834
God!

00:01:39.834 --> 00:01:40.800
[groans]

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:41.867
[bird chirping]

00:01:41.867 --> 00:01:43.967
Exhausting.

00:01:43.967 --> 00:01:48.433
Before we go any further, I
have to wash all this sand off.

00:01:48.433 --> 00:01:51.867
When you've got all that
grit in your clothing,

00:01:51.867 --> 00:01:53.567
it's grinding against your skin.

00:01:53.567 --> 00:01:55.900
And you get all that chafing.

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:01.100
Out here, it could lead to
infection, which is just

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.300
going to magnify the problems.

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.100
Now my clothes are clean.

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.300
I can carry on.
