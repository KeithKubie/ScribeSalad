00:00:01.367 --> 00:00:03.169
I'm not sexist so this has
nothing to do with your

00:00:03.202 --> 00:00:06.506
gender but you're acting like a
harpy slut.

00:00:06.539 --> 00:00:08.674
You've participated in a
trolling cliche.

00:00:08.707 --> 00:00:12.211
- Pretending your gendered
insult isn't sexism.

00:00:12.244 --> 00:00:14.113
Well there are some things
that you say to a woman

00:00:14.146 --> 00:00:16.783
to insult her that you'd
never say to a man.

00:00:16.816 --> 00:00:19.052
That's a truth that we
would call self-evident.

00:00:19.085 --> 00:00:20.887
Or, if I were a woman, you'd
call

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.056
self-evident you dumb bitch.

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:26.592
It's sexist to use words like
witch, bitch, slut, cunt,

00:00:26.625 --> 00:00:29.395
hysterical, every time you
describe a woman you disagree

00:00:29.428 --> 00:00:31.931
with like Ruth Bader Ginsburg,
Hillary,

00:00:31.964 --> 00:00:33.566
Ann Coulter, or my mother.

00:00:33.599 --> 00:00:35.334
And my mother's not a witch.

00:00:35.367 --> 00:00:37.170
She's an asshole.

00:00:37.203 --> 00:00:38.171
She's Ann Coulter.

00:00:38.204 --> 00:00:40.707
