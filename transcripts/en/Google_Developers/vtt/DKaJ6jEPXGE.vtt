00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.840
The third thing I wanted to show is you some
further out thinking we are doing about how

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:10.269
we can do animations inside of CSS, and JavaScript
and HTML5.

00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:17.089
So here is an application that is a prototype
that we are using to experiment with CSS in

00:00:17.089 --> 00:00:21.420
JavaScript. And this is an advertisement we
are using as an example and we put this together

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.060
because we like Ducati and we thought it would
be fun to show it as part of the example.

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:30.930
This is using totally HTML and CSS and I can
transition between a couple states. So you

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:34.460
can see I have a pre-roll state here. I've
got a bunch of layers. I can see the different

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.789
items on the page. And when I go to a different
state, it animates automatically.

00:00:38.789 --> 00:00:44.000
I want a bike to come in here, so to do that
I am going to make the different shapes I

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.910
have defined here with CSS appear on the stage.
And I can do that simply by editing these

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:55.070
values, so I make this show up by changing
its left side, and then I am going to change

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:00.629
its opacity. And then you will see the bike
will fly in from the right. It is happening

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.260
live as I do this editing here and when I
change between the two states you can see

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:09.040
the animation is working.
I want to make this nav down here work and

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:15.930
add a second bike to come in. So I am going
to duplicate this, calling it bike 2 and that's

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.320
creating another CSS animation basically around
the second state, and I want the first bike

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.070
to go away and the second bike to come in.
So first let's make the first bike go away,

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:31.780
we'll make it fly off fast and make it a thousand
pixels off the stage and there goes the bike.

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:37.140
So now I am going to make the new bike fly
in. And I want the bike to fly in, be visible

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:42.770
and show up on the left like we did before.
I have to type in pixels. There it is.

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.150
All right. Cool.
So now I have these different states set up

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:49.400
in my application. And I want to make it so
that when I click on the nav, go to that bike.

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:57.060
So I am going to add a trigger. On click of
the nav bike 2, which is a CSS ID, I am going

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:02.160
to be able to now animate to that bike. So
let's preview this in the browser. There's

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:06.790
the ad, rolls in, thing comes up, I click
on bike 2, and it acts and bike 2 comes out.

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:08.660
Isn't that cool?
[ Applause ]

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:16.130
&gt;&gt;Kevin Lynch: Of course I can add other transitions
and rollover effects and things like that,

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:20.349
but that's some of the work we are doing now
to see what's really possible in terms of

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:25.620
enabling tooling, great tooling around CSS,
HTML5 and these other technologies.

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.849
So that's some of the work we are doing.
Now, there's one more thing I wanted to talk

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:34.109
about, which is support for video. And you
know there's been a lot of great work in video

00:02:34.109 --> 00:02:37.969
done on the Web, and it's great to see innovation
continuing, and we are really excited to see

00:02:37.969 --> 00:02:43.709
the VP8 work that's happening now. So we are
so excited, we are going to put VP8 inside

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:48.069
a Flash player and we are going to distribute
VP8 to over a billion people in less than

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:50.610
a year of its release.
So we are going to really help push out the

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:54.510
VP8 CODEC.
[ Applause ]

00:02:54.510 --> 00:03:00.609
&gt;&gt;Kevin Lynch: We're really excited at what
people are going to be able to do as video

00:03:00.609 --> 00:03:05.400
keeps maturing like this and innovating. And
the other area we are working on is of course

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.780
we are working with Google on a bunch of devices
with Flash, and you are going to see a lot

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:12.690
more of that on day two.
We are really excited about it, and we are

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.680
really happy with the innovation that's going
on in the Web and happy to be part of it.

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:25.550
So thank you very much for having us here.
&gt;&gt;Sundar Pichai: Thanks, Kevin.

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:31.239
So we have seen these great Web applications
and what you can do with HTML5.

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:35.370
But I want to talk about a couple of problems
which remain on the Web.

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:42.790
The first is that it is very hard for users
to find Web applications. In the earlier days,

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:47.560
literally you could walk into a retail store
and pick software off the shelf. Then we talked

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:51.849
about all the popular desktop applications,
and it turned out there were sites like download.com

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:58.519
where you could go and find these applications.
Since 2004, we talked about how Web applications

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:04.099
are the main way by which developers are writing
applications on computers. It turns out it's

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:09.430
very hard to find these applications.
Think about this example. Let's try to find

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:14.599
a great chess game on the Web. I have tried
do so. It turns out there are many, many great

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:20.220
chess games on the Web, but it's very hard
to find one which is really good. There's

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:24.850
no way for you to get ratings and reviews.
You can search for it but you can't see rating,

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:28.210
you can't see reviews. You don't know how
many people are using this game. You can't

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:32.540
engage in a discussion with other people who
are playing the same game.

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:37.350
It turns out it's actually much easier on
a mobile phone to go find a chess game, whereas

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:40.010
it is very, very hard to do the same on the
Web.

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:45.500
So that's one problem. Photograph the second
problem is, as developers, when you write

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:51.210
these applications, you need users to discover
and use these applications. You need reach.

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:54.840
You need to know how many users are you going
to get for this application.

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:59.940
The second thing developers care about is
monetization. Today, advertising is the primary

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:04.250
form to do this and it works great in many,
many cases. So advertising has been a very

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:08.640
important form much monetization on the Web.
But we want to create other alternatives as

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:12.590
well.
For example, it should be easy to create and

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:17.770
sell a premium application on the Web.
So these are the two problems we have been

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:22.420
thinking hard about, and as part of that,
we want to give you an early preview of a

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:27.540
product, what we call Chrome Web Store.
So I am going to introduce Kan Liu who is

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:31.540
the product manager on the Chrome team who
is going to walk us through the Chrome Web

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:33.740
Store.
Again, this is an early preview. We are pulling

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:40.140
this off Chrome nightly build, so bear with
us. What you are saying is a new type age

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:46.030
of Chrome. It's a friendly paradigm to most
users. These are applications, icons which

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:50.360
we have installed right on the New Tab page.
One caveat though, these are Web applications.

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:54.590
You can find them on the Web anywhere but
now you can conveniently add it onto your

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:58.380
New Tab page.
As you can see there's Clicker. Jim Lanzone

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:02.100
talked about the clicker.com. I love that
application. I have it installed on my new

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:05.020
tab page.
Let's go ahead and try one application. Let's

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:10.750
try Tweetdeck. I'm sure many of you are using
Tweetdeck right now in this audience. Tweetdeck

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:16.200
has redone a complete HTML5 version of their
application as well, and so what you are seeing

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:21.520
is fully in the browser. It's really slick.
You can drag and drop it. Let's go ahead and

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:27.710
add a key word for Google so we can start
watching the tweets come in. So you can add

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:32.460
Google. They used the notifications API to
deliver tweets to you right in the browser.

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:37.680
They also used the Joy location API. So you
can click on it and see where all the tweets

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:42.960
are coming from.
So this is all done using HTML5 in the browser.

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:48.050
Let's go ahead and send a tweet, and we can
send it to the Google I/O channel, live Google

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:51.930
I/O.
So this is an application which I have conveniently

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:57.020
installed in the New Tab page.
Let's go back there. One icon you will see

00:06:57.020 --> 00:07:01.740
on the bottom right is what we calm the Chrome
Web Store. So you click on the Web Store icon

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:09.650
and it takes you to a gallery full of applications.
And so you can go here, discover applications,

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:14.570
find ratings review, find how many users are
using these applications, add comments, et

00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:18.060
cetera.
So Darkroom, you saw the demo earlier. You

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:22.990
saw the application. It cost 4.99. I can go
ahead and buy it.

00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:28.490
We have worked very hard to simplify the process
so once you set it up, it's normally one click

00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:32.700
to buy an application.
So you can buy it and add its straight into

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:36.610
the New Tab page of Chrome, and you can start
using it right away.

00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:41.500
So let's go back there. It turns out one of
the important class of applications on the

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:49.080
Web is games. And people spend more time -- In
all app stores, games are the most popular

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:54.510
form of application. So let's try a couple.
Plants &amp; Zombies. It is a very popular game

00:07:54.510 --> 00:08:00.180
on phones. Now you have it in the Chrome Web
Store. So you can click on it, and as you

00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:04.990
can see, it's a full immersive full screen
experience right in the browser the way most

00:08:04.990 --> 00:08:12.160
people want to play games. And this is built
on Flash. And applications in the Chrome Web

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:17.380
Store can be built on standard Web technologies,
including Flash, and we will support all of

00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:21.840
them in the Chrome Web Store.
So the goal of this game is to knock zombies

00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:24.910
out, so -- we can move on.
[ Laughter ]

00:08:24.910 --> 00:08:32.500
&gt;&gt;Sundar Pichai: Let's go to the Web Store.
Another game which is a different class of

00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:39.759
game which I am excited to show, we call this
Lego Star Wars. It is a 3D game. We were wondering

00:08:39.759 --> 00:08:45.410
what game to show this audience, and we figured
as long as it has 3D, Legos and Star Wars,

00:08:45.410 --> 00:08:46.670
it's going to work well.
[ Applause ]

00:08:46.670 --> 00:08:55.470
&gt;&gt;Sundar Pichai: So we worked with this company
called Unity Technologies. They have a game

00:08:55.470 --> 00:09:00.149
engine which really simplifies the development
pipeline for game developers.

00:09:00.149 --> 00:09:05.350
We are showing it using their plug-in, but
they have a working demo in their sandbox

00:09:05.350 --> 00:09:09.870
of porting this game on top of native client
of open source technology which we will have

00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:14.600
in Chrome.
Most game engines are written in native code,

00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:18.779
and it's going to be very hard to rewrite
these in JavaScript. But now you can use something

00:09:18.779 --> 00:09:22.199
like native client to run them directly in
the browser.

00:09:22.199 --> 00:09:28.740
So the purpose of this game is to go rescue
R2D2 and kill all the bad droids out there.

00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:36.360
As you can see, it is a full 3D game. It is
very rich, and it leverages a lot of HTML5

00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:40.970
APIs.
And Unity is working to put all that you are

00:09:40.970 --> 00:09:45.040
game on top of native client to get it working
in Chrome.

00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:49.850
So these are rich, immersive 3D gaming experiences
which will be coming to the browser as well.

00:09:49.850 --> 00:09:50.030
So let's move on.
