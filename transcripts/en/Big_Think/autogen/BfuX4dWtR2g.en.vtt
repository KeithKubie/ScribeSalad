well about two years ago I stumbled on a

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:08.440
well about two years ago I stumbled on a
 

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:10.740
well about two years ago I stumbled on a
piece of neuroscience that just stunned

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:10.750
piece of neuroscience that just stunned
 

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:13.650
piece of neuroscience that just stunned
me as a psychologist I wish somebody had

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:13.660
me as a psychologist I wish somebody had
 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:16.260
me as a psychologist I wish somebody had
told me more about this but what I

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:16.270
told me more about this but what I
 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:18.300
told me more about this but what I
learned is that there appears to be a

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:18.310
learned is that there appears to be a
 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:20.130
learned is that there appears to be a
part of our brain called the ventral

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:20.140
part of our brain called the ventral
 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:22.860
part of our brain called the ventral
striatum that's the technical term or

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:22.870
striatum that's the technical term or
 

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:24.540
striatum that's the technical term or
you also could call it the seeking

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:24.550
you also could call it the seeking
 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:28.890
you also could call it the seeking
system and that this system is urging us

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:28.900
system and that this system is urging us
 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:31.710
system and that this system is urging us
to explore the boundaries of what we

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:31.720
to explore the boundaries of what we
 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.950
to explore the boundaries of what we
know it's urging us to be curious and by

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:34.960
know it's urging us to be curious and by
 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.800
know it's urging us to be curious and by

evolutionarily this system was developed

00:00:55.139 --> 00:00:55.149
evolutionarily this system was developed
 

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:58.290
evolutionarily this system was developed
to help us to keep us learning and so

00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:58.300
to help us to keep us learning and so
 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.299
to help us to keep us learning and so
when I learned about this seeking system

00:01:00.299 --> 00:01:00.309
when I learned about this seeking system
 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:02.790
when I learned about this seeking system
it really turned me on because it

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:02.800
it really turned me on because it
 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.130
it really turned me on because it
started to give me an insight into why

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:05.140
started to give me an insight into why
 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:08.490
started to give me an insight into why
disengagement from boring work that may

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:08.500
disengagement from boring work that may
 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.740
disengagement from boring work that may
not be a bug that might be a feature in

not be a bug that might be a feature in

not be a bug that might be a feature in
the 2015-2016 Gallup polls the evidence

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:14.770
the 2015-2016 Gallup polls the evidence
 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:17.399
the 2015-2016 Gallup polls the evidence
is that about 70 percent of people are

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:17.409
is that about 70 percent of people are
 

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:19.890
is that about 70 percent of people are
not engaged in what they do all day long

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:19.900
not engaged in what they do all day long
 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.380
not engaged in what they do all day long
and about 18 percent of people are

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:22.390
and about 18 percent of people are
 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:24.899
and about 18 percent of people are
repulsed they're actively disengaged

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:24.909
repulsed they're actively disengaged
 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:27.960
repulsed they're actively disengaged
from what they do and I think that the

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:27.970
from what they do and I think that the
 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:29.730
from what they do and I think that the
reason why I say this is a problem and

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:29.740
reason why I say this is a problem and
 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:31.320
reason why I say this is a problem and
it could even be called an epidemic is

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:31.330
it could even be called an epidemic is
 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:36.030
it could even be called an epidemic is
because work is mostly what we do we

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:36.040
because work is mostly what we do we
 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:37.350
because work is mostly what we do we
spend so much more time at work than

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:37.360
spend so much more time at work than
 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.210
spend so much more time at work than
with our families and then there's

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:39.220
with our families and then there's
 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:41.250
with our families and then there's
things called hobbies and so I think

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:41.260
things called hobbies and so I think
 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.800
things called hobbies and so I think
that the pervasiveness of people feeling

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:43.810
that the pervasiveness of people feeling
 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:46.440
that the pervasiveness of people feeling
like workers a thing that we have to

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.450
like workers a thing that we have to
 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.190
like workers a thing that we have to
shut off from a thing that we can't be

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:50.200
shut off from a thing that we can't be
 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.350
shut off from a thing that we can't be
our best selves a thing that we have to

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:52.360
our best selves a thing that we have to
 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.710
our best selves a thing that we have to
get through on the weight of the weekend

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:55.720
get through on the weight of the weekend
 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:57.570
get through on the weight of the weekend
I think that that is a sort of

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:57.580
I think that that is a sort of
 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:01.710
I think that that is a sort of
humanistic sickness and while it is bad

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:01.720
humanistic sickness and while it is bad
 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:04.080
humanistic sickness and while it is bad
for people that's the humanistic bit it

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.090
for people that's the humanistic bit it
 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.270
for people that's the humanistic bit it
also is really bad for organizations who

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.280
also is really bad for organizations who
 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:08.729
also is really bad for organizations who
get lackluster performance I think that

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:08.739
get lackluster performance I think that
 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:10.199
get lackluster performance I think that
it's interesting to think about when

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:10.209
it's interesting to think about when
 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:12.780
it's interesting to think about when
this all started happening and you know

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790
this all started happening and you know
 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.300
this all started happening and you know
I didn't live back in the 1850s but all

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310
I didn't live back in the 1850s but all
 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.670
I didn't live back in the 1850s but all
the records suggest that you could buy

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680
the records suggest that you could buy
 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:18.480
the records suggest that you could buy
shoes

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:18.490
shoes
 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:20.670
shoes
and their shoes would be sold by some

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680
and their shoes would be sold by some
 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.910
and their shoes would be sold by some
store some cobbler and maybe there'd be

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920
store some cobbler and maybe there'd be
 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.590
store some cobbler and maybe there'd be
three people that work there rarely

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:25.600
three people that work there rarely
 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:26.910
three people that work there rarely
would there be five people that work

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920
would there be five people that work
 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.120
would there be five people that work
there and while that probably wasn't the

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130
there and while that probably wasn't the
 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:32.220
there and while that probably wasn't the
best work in the world each of the

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230
best work in the world each of the
 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:33.450
best work in the world each of the
people in the store would watch the

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:33.460
people in the store would watch the
 

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:35.520
people in the store would watch the
customer walk in and then they'd make a

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530
customer walk in and then they'd make a
 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.250
customer walk in and then they'd make a
shoe for that customer and they take

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260
shoe for that customer and they take
 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:39.510
shoe for that customer and they take
leather and they'd sew it and then

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:39.520
leather and they'd sew it and then
 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:42.600
leather and they'd sew it and then
they'd give it and around 1890 we got

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610
they'd give it and around 1890 we got
 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:45.120
they'd give it and around 1890 we got
this different idea as a species where

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.130
this different idea as a species where
 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:46.920
this different idea as a species where
we should not sell two pairs of shoes

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930
we should not sell two pairs of shoes
 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.860
we should not sell two pairs of shoes
each day but two million and this idea

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870
each day but two million and this idea
 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.170
each day but two million and this idea
of scaling up had certain implications

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180
of scaling up had certain implications
 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.960
of scaling up had certain implications
for how work felt and part of that was

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970
for how work felt and part of that was
 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:57.870
for how work felt and part of that was
because it was decided that the way to

because it was decided that the way to
 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.690
because it was decided that the way to
do this would have extreme efficiency by

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700
do this would have extreme efficiency by
 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.580
do this would have extreme efficiency by
breaking the work into really small

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590
breaking the work into really small
 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:06.000
breaking the work into really small

beginning to end and this idea of
 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.210
beginning to end and this idea of
removing the meaning from the work was

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220
removing the meaning from the work was
 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:22.040
removing the meaning from the work was
intentional and the idea of removing the

curiosity from the job was intentional

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230
curiosity from the job was intentional
 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:30.360
