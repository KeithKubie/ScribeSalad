I'm Jaye Watson.

exploring the mysteries

00:00:20.686 --> 00:00:23.722 align:start size:88% position:13% line:83%

the amazing human brain.

00:00:23.822 --> 00:00:25.691 line:83%
Daniel Meadows was
fresh out of college

00:00:25.791 --> 00:00:27.927
and beginning the next
chapter of his life,

00:00:28.027 --> 00:00:30.997
when he began suffering
debilitating headaches.

00:00:31.097 --> 00:00:33.432 align:start size:84% position:16%
Those headaches turned
out to be a tumor.

00:00:33.533 --> 00:00:35.701
One that was very close
to the area of the brain

00:00:35.801 --> 00:00:37.737
necessary for language.

00:00:37.837 --> 00:00:41.473 align:start size:91% position:9%
So Daniel did something
most of us cannot imagine.

00:00:41.573 --> 00:00:44.877 align:start size:84% position:16%
He was awake for
his own brain surgery.

<i> (Dr. Deibert)
 There's kind of a little bit
 of a hole where it was,</i>

00:07:21.473 --> 00:07:23.809 align:start size:88% position:13%
<i> and the brain has started
 to fill in that space.</i>

00:07:23.909 --> 00:07:25.244
100% success.

00:07:25.344 --> 00:07:28.246
Um, his MRI after surgery
showed that completely,

00:07:28.347 --> 00:07:29.882
the tumor had
been removed.

00:07:29.982 --> 00:07:31.817 align:start size:75% position:25% line:88%
<i> (Jaye)
 Daniel's language
 was not impacted.</i>

00:07:31.917 --> 00:07:34.453 line:91%
<i> The surgery
 was a success.</i>

00:07:34.553 --> 00:07:37.223 line:91%
<i> But the pathology
 overshadows that.</i>

00:07:37.323 --> 00:07:38.891 align:start position:0% line:91%
Now we know, again,
that some of those cells

00:07:38.991 --> 00:07:41.860 align:start position:0%
have spread to other places,
most likely.

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:44.496 align:start size:88% position:13%
<i> (Jaye)
 Those cells that may have
 spread to other places</i>

00:07:44.596 --> 00:07:46.032

00:07:46.132 --> 00:07:47.766
<i> Glioblastoma.</i>

00:07:47.866 --> 00:07:50.469 align:start size:75% position:25%
<i> An aggressive,

00:07:50.569 --> 00:07:52.371 align:start size:81% position:19%
Hey.
It's good to see you.

00:07:52.471 --> 00:07:54.540 align:start size:63% position:38% line:83%
You look much better
than last time.

00:07:52.471 --> 00:07:54.540
Thank you.

00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:55.841 align:start size:13% position:88%

 So, as I told you
 in the hospital,</i>

00:07:59.645 --> 00:08:00.880 align:start size:69% position:31%
<i> surgery couldn't have
 gone any better.</i>

00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:05.017 size:81% position:59%
I mean-- and that-- a lot
of that is to your credit.

00:08:05.117 --> 00:08:08.954 align:start size:81% position:19%
<i> Everything that I can see
 on the MRI is gone, okay?</i>

00:08:09.054 --> 00:08:10.322 align:start size:19% position:81%
<i> Um...</i>

00:08:10.422 --> 00:08:13.325 align:start size:81% position:19%
<i> (Jaye)
 There is no easy way
 to deliver this news.</i>

00:08:13.425 --> 00:08:15.761 align:start size:56% position:44%
<i> This is some sort
 of glioma, okay?</i>

00:08:15.861 --> 00:08:17.362 align:start size:88% position:13% line:85%
Okay.

00:08:15.861 --> 00:08:17.362 align:start size:50% position:50%
<i> Um, there are--</i>

00:08:17.462 --> 00:08:20.700 size:81% position:59%
<i> there is a little bit of
 a range of gliomas, okay?</i>

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:23.636 align:start size:81% position:19%
The, uh, ones that we hear
most about are things--

00:08:23.736 --> 00:08:26.939 align:start size:59% position:41% line:83%
is a problem called
glioblastoma, okay?

00:08:23.736 --> 00:08:26.939
Yeah.

00:08:27.039 --> 00:08:31.977 align:start size:78% position:22%
<i> And that's John McCain,
 Beau Biden, Ted Kennedy.</i>

00:08:32.077 --> 00:08:34.413 align:start size:66% position:34%
We can't cure gliomas

how severe or... not--

00:08:49.762 --> 00:08:54.467 align:start size:56% position:44%

00:08:58.871 --> 00:09:01.106

I haven't asked,
"Why me?"

00:09:02.575 --> 00:09:03.842 align:start size:78% position:22% line:0%
I mean, I-I don't-I
don't see why

00:09:03.942 --> 00:09:05.978 line:0%

Yeah.

00:09:18.391 --> 00:09:19.424 align:start position:0%

So...

00:09:19.524 --> 00:09:21.126 align:start size:16% position:84%
Yeah.

00:09:21.226 --> 00:09:22.294 align:start size:59% position:41%
One step at a time.

00:09:22.394 --> 00:09:25.498
<i> (laughing)</i>

00:09:37.376 --> 00:09:38.910 align:start size:78% position:22%
Daniel has finished
radiation,

00:09:39.011 --> 00:09:41.313 align:start size:75% position:25%
and is continuing
chemotherapy.

00:09:41.413 --> 00:09:43.882 align:start size:84% position:16%
He worked full-time
through his treatment,

00:09:43.982 --> 00:09:45.851 align:start size:78% position:22%
and says
he's feeling well.

00:09:50.089 --> 00:09:52.991 align:start size:84% position:16%
We all feel lonely
or left out sometimes.

00:09:53.091 --> 00:09:54.726
And now we know that
the cause could be

00:09:54.826 --> 00:09:56.996 align:start size:81% position:19%
that you're not
getting enough sleep.

00:09:57.096 --> 00:10:00.466 align:start size:94% position:6%
Most experts recommend
seven to nine hours a night.

00:10:00.566 --> 00:10:03.335 align:start size:97% position:3%
But new research shows that
if you don't get enough sleep,

00:10:03.435 --> 00:10:05.938 align:start size:88% position:13%
well, you could be
killing your social life.

00:10:06.038 --> 00:10:07.973 align:start size:72% position:28%
Researchers at
UC Berkeley

00:10:08.073 --> 00:10:11.610 align:start size:88% position:13%
found that sleep-deprived
people are lonelier,

00:10:11.710 --> 00:10:14.146
and less likely to
engage other people.

00:10:14.246 --> 00:10:16.348
<i> Using functional
 MRI brain imaging,</i>

00:10:16.448 --> 00:10:18.851 align:start size:94% position:6% line:83%

00:10:18.951 --> 00:10:20.553 line:85%

 too close for comfort,</i>

00:10:22.588 --> 00:10:25.057 align:start size:88% position:13% line:83%
<i> they could press a button
 to stop the video.</i>

00:10:25.157 --> 00:10:26.425
<i> Those who hadn't
 slept enough,</i>

00:10:26.525 --> 00:10:29.228 align:start size:91% position:9%
<i> hit that button far sooner
 than the well-rested.</i>

00:10:29.328 --> 00:10:31.530 align:start size:81% position:19%
<i> The study also found
 that sleep loss</i>

00:10:31.630 --> 00:10:34.133 align:start size:81% position:19%
<i> blunted activity
 in the brain regions</i>

00:10:34.233 --> 00:10:36.469 align:start size:84% position:16%
<i> that normally encourage
 social engagement.</i>

00:10:38.103 --> 00:10:39.605 align:start size:75% position:25%
Now we have even
more reason

00:10:39.705 --> 00:10:41.240 align:start size:75% position:25%
to get some
much-needed rest.

00:10:42.708 --> 00:10:45.310
It's something millions of
Americans do each year...

00:10:45.410 --> 00:10:46.879
get a massage.

00:10:46.979 --> 00:10:50.749
For most, it's for relaxation,
or to help with body stress,

00:10:50.849 --> 00:10:52.551
or pain from an injury.

00:10:52.651 --> 00:10:54.386
But research is showing
that massage can have

00:10:54.486 --> 00:10:57.890 align:start size:84% position:16%
a big impact on
cancer-related fatigue.

00:10:57.990 --> 00:11:00.959
A condition that impacts
many cancer survivors.

00:11:01.060 --> 00:11:03.429 align:start position:0%
Turns out,
the science of massage

00:11:03.529 --> 00:11:05.231 align:start position:0%
is more than skin-deep.

<i> (Jaye)

Yes.

00:12:26.645 --> 00:12:29.247 align:start size:69% position:31% line:83%
I tend to be really

00:12:29.348 --> 00:12:34.119 align:start size:81% position:19% line:83%
And so... here was
this-this entity, massage,

00:12:39.291 --> 00:12:41.860 align:start size:69% position:31% line:83%

Great.
Thank you.

<i> (Jaye)
 The condition can affect
 up to 80% of people</i>

00:13:48.693 --> 00:13:50.262
<i> who get chemotherapy,</i>

00:13:50.362 --> 00:13:53.532 align:start position:0%

radiation treatment for cancer.</i>

00:13:53.632 --> 00:13:55.400 align:start size:63% position:38%
Oh, that's terrible.

00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:57.836 align:start size:84% position:16%
This fatigue may be
related to a low level

00:13:57.936 --> 00:14:00.038
of chronic inflammation.

00:14:00.138 --> 00:14:01.340 align:start size:91% position:9%
<i> (Jaye)
 By the time Fred signed up,</i>

00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:03.976 align:start position:0%
<i>Rapaport and his team had
already studied massage therapy</i>

00:14:04.076 --> 00:14:05.777
<i> on breast cancer patients.</i>

00:14:05.878 --> 00:14:09.781 align:start size:72% position:28%
And what we saw was
remarkable improvements

00:14:09.881 --> 00:14:13.351 align:start size:63% position:38%
in two separate
measures of fatigue.

00:14:13.451 --> 00:14:14.386 align:start size:72% position:28%
<i> (Jaye)
 Those measures,</i>

00:14:14.486 --> 00:14:16.588
<i> the Multidimensional
 Fatigue Inventory</i>

00:14:16.688 --> 00:14:19.692
<i> and the NIH Patient Related
 Outcome Measure of Fatigue,</i>

00:14:19.792 --> 00:14:21.259 align:start size:78% position:22%
<i> showed that the
 women found massage</i>

00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:26.598
<i> provided clinically
 significant relief.</i>

00:14:26.698 --> 00:14:29.501 align:start size:66% position:34% line:88%
<i> (Dr. Rapaport)
 So the question was,
 one, um,</i>

00:14:29.602 --> 00:14:33.905 align:start size:75% position:25% line:91%
<i> do men respond the same
 to massage as women?</i>

00:14:34.005 --> 00:14:38.643 size:84% position:58%
And two, do men with a very
different type of cancer,

00:14:38.743 --> 00:14:44.083 align:start size:56% position:44%
also with fatigue,
respond?

00:14:44.183 --> 00:14:47.119 align:start size:91% position:9%
<i> (Jaye)
 Once a week for six weeks,
 Fred got a massage.</i>

00:14:48.854 --> 00:14:51.956 align:start size:75% position:25%
For an hour,
I was in heaven.

00:14:52.056 --> 00:14:53.591 align:start size:75% position:25%
<i> (Jaye)
 He also had
 his blood taken,</i>

00:14:53.692 --> 00:14:56.294 align:start size:81% position:19%
<i> and rated his fatigue
 levels on an app.</i>

00:14:56.394 --> 00:14:59.598 align:start size:91% position:9%
How often do you experience
extreme exhaustion?

00:14:59.698 --> 00:15:01.200
Often.

00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:03.802
How often do you
run out of energy?

00:15:03.902 --> 00:15:05.137
Always.

00:15:05.237 --> 00:15:08.473 align:start size:72% position:28%
<i> (Jaye)
 After six weeks
 of massage...</i>

00:15:08.573 --> 00:15:10.742 align:start position:0%
<i>(Fred)
Oh, I feel like
my old self.</i>

00:15:10.842 --> 00:15:13.679 align:start size:88% position:13%
Um, Sunday,
after church,

00:15:13.779 --> 00:15:16.015 size:84% position:42%
I was outside pulling weeds
for three-and-a-half hours.

00:15:18.250 --> 00:15:20.853 align:start position:0%
<i>I would probably still
be dragging around.</i>

00:15:20.953 --> 00:15:23.489 align:start position:0%
<i>Lack of energy.</i>

00:15:23.589 --> 00:15:25.991 align:start position:0%
A cranky old guy.

00:15:26.091 --> 00:15:28.159 align:start size:88% position:13%
<i> (Jaye)
 The rubbing and kneading
 of muscles and joints</i>

00:15:28.259 --> 00:15:31.096
<i> in the body was
 affecting change</i>

00:15:31.196 --> 00:15:33.465 align:start size:78% position:22%
<i> far deeper than
 muscles and joints.</i>

00:15:33.565 --> 00:15:37.936 align:start size:81% position:19%
I think that massage
is changing and modulating

00:15:38.036 --> 00:15:41.473 align:start size:72% position:28%
our immune system
in a way that decreases

00:15:41.573 --> 00:15:44.142 align:start size:59% position:41%
sort of the chronic
inflammatory states

00:15:44.242 --> 00:15:47.512 align:start size:59% position:41%
<i> that occur in
 certain disorders.</i>

00:15:47.612 --> 00:15:50.482 align:start size:75% position:25%
<i> We're seeing a decrease
 in inflammatory markers</i>

00:15:50.582 --> 00:15:53.051 align:start size:66% position:34%
associated with these
cancer survivors

00:15:53.151 --> 00:15:55.921 align:start size:59% position:41%
who've been plagued
by chronic fatigue.

00:15:56.021 --> 00:15:57.555 align:start size:63% position:38%
We need to do
more analysis there,

00:15:57.655 --> 00:16:00.425 align:start size:56% position:44%
but it looks very,
very positive.

00:16:00.525 --> 00:16:01.660 align:start size:72% position:28%
<i> (Jaye)
 Nine years in,</i>

00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:04.062
<i> this research is making
 a powerful connection.</i>

00:16:04.162 --> 00:16:05.564 align:start size:44% position:56%
I could not do
this before.

00:16:05.664 --> 00:16:09.401 align:start size:94% position:6%
<i> (Jaye)
 That massage impacts not
 just the body, but the mind.</i>

00:16:09.501 --> 00:16:12.771 align:start size:59% position:41%
Our body influences
the brain,

00:16:12.871 --> 00:16:15.207 align:start size:63% position:38%
just as the brain
influences the body.

00:16:15.307 --> 00:16:17.810
<i> (laughing)</i>

00:16:20.712 --> 00:16:22.580
More trials will
soon be underway,

00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:25.684
to continue to prove that
massage can relieve fatigue

00:16:25.784 --> 00:16:27.785
in many different
types of cancers.

00:16:27.885 --> 00:16:31.090
Giving an effective treatment
option to people who need it.

00:16:35.194 --> 00:16:36.361 align:start size:84% position:16%
You don't need a study
to tell you

00:16:36.461 --> 00:16:38.297 align:start size:84% position:16%
that having one of
these guys in your life

00:16:38.397 --> 00:16:40.965
can make it better
in so many ways.

00:16:41.065 --> 00:16:44.103
Research shows us that our
feel-good hormone, oxytocin,

00:16:44.203 --> 00:16:47.639 align:start size:91% position:9%
actually increases when
we interact with our dogs.

00:16:47.739 --> 00:16:50.876 align:start size:94% position:6%
Oxytocin is the hormone
that bonds us to our babies.

00:16:50.976 --> 00:16:53.612 align:start size:84% position:16%
Now research is showing
that therapy dogs

00:16:53.712 --> 00:16:56.981 align:start size:97% position:3%
can help decrease the symptoms
of ADHD in children.

00:16:57.081 --> 00:16:58.383 align:start size:81% position:19%
<i> In the study,
 half of the children</i>

00:16:58.483 --> 00:17:00.519 align:start size:88% position:13%
<i> attended a social skills
 program.</i>

00:17:00.619 --> 00:17:02.887
<i> And the other half went
 through the same program,</i>

00:17:02.988 --> 00:17:05.491 align:start size:91% position:9%
<i> but each had a therapy dog
 at their side.</i>

00:17:05.591 --> 00:17:08.093 align:start size:97% position:3%
<i> Both groups showed improvement
 after 12 weeks.</i>

00:17:08.193 --> 00:17:11.029
<i> But the group with dogs
 showed marked improvement</i>

00:17:11.129 --> 00:17:12.831
<i> after just 8 weeks.</i>

00:17:12.931 --> 00:17:15.634 align:start size:91% position:9%
<i> They experienced
 a reduction in inattention,</i>

00:17:15.734 --> 00:17:18.070
<i> and an improvement
 in social skills.</i>

00:17:18.170 --> 00:17:19.337
<i> And an added bonus,</i>

00:17:19.437 --> 00:17:20.538
<i> their parents reported</i>

00:17:20.638 --> 00:17:23.875
<i> significantly fewer
 problem behaviors.</i>

00:17:23.975 --> 00:17:25.710 align:start size:84% position:16%
Great news for parents
looking for options

00:17:25.811 --> 00:17:27.679
to treat their
child's ADHD.

00:17:27.779 --> 00:17:30.349 align:start size:88% position:13%
And really great news
for kids who want a dog.

00:17:33.018 --> 00:17:34.686 align:start size:81% position:19%
It's probably one of
the most common

00:17:34.786 --> 00:17:38.390
New Year's resolutions
we make... exercise.

00:17:38.490 --> 00:17:39.958
How we're gonna
do more of it.

00:17:40.058 --> 00:17:42.927 align:start size:88% position:13%
How, this time,
we're gonna stick to it.

00:17:43.027 --> 00:17:45.230 align:start size:88% position:13%
We do it to lose weight,
to reduce stress,

00:17:45.330 --> 00:17:47.432
to feel better
about ourselves.

00:17:47.532 --> 00:17:50.302 align:start size:72% position:28%
But what if
exercise alone

00:17:50.402 --> 00:17:52.571 align:start size:78% position:22%
could make
your brain younger?

00:17:52.671 --> 00:17:53.972
According to research,

00:17:54.072 --> 00:17:57.075
that's exactly
what it can do.

Good-- keep it up
a little bit longer.

00:18:43.054 --> 00:18:44.622 line:83%
So, I-I'm really interested
in the language function,

00:18:44.722 --> 00:18:46.658 line:83%
and how the brain behaves
during language function,

00:18:46.758 --> 00:18:48.860 align:start size:88% position:13% line:83%
particularly how it
behaves in older adults.

00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:51.263 line:83%
And Dr. McGregor is really
interested in motor function.

00:18:51.363 --> 00:18:54.666
And he studies just simple
finger-tapping movements.

00:18:54.766 --> 00:18:58.736 align:start size:94% position:6%
<i> (Jaye)
 Aging people often have less

00:20:12.811 --> 00:20:16.481 align:start size:81% position:19%
This actually will sh-show
how one side of the brain

<i> (Jaye)
 This quieting of one

00:20:29.594 --> 00:20:31.463 align:start size:66% position:34%
is called the
primary motor cortex.

00:20:31.563 --> 00:20:34.466 size:88% position:56%
And so when I'm stimulating,
you're getting a response,

00:20:34.566 --> 00:20:36.768 align:start size:38% position:63%
essentially,
in my arm,

00:20:36.868 --> 00:20:39.670 align:start size:50% position:50%
and then down to
my hand. So...

00:20:39.770 --> 00:20:43.141 align:start size:84% position:16%
<i> (Jaye)
 But as the brain ages,
 in language and task,</i>

00:20:43.241 --> 00:20:45.209
<i> inhibition is lost.</i>

00:20:45.309 --> 00:20:48.847 align:start size:91% position:9%
<i> And both sides of the brain
 begin to be activated.</i>

00:20:48.947 --> 00:20:51.482 size:84% position:42%
And this increased activity
on both sides is not good.

00:20:51.582 --> 00:20:52.650 align:start position:0%
It doesn't improve
performance,

00:20:52.750 --> 00:20:54.386 size:78% position:39%
so it's not compensation.

00:20:54.486 --> 00:20:56.387 align:start size:88% position:13%
<i> (Jaye)
 And that's when language
 and motor skills,</i>

00:20:56.488 --> 00:20:59.124 align:start size:84% position:16%
<i> things we need to
 maneuver through life,</i>

00:20:59.224 --> 00:21:00.892
<i> get more difficult.</i>

00:21:02.627 --> 00:21:04.629 align:start size:78% position:22%
<i> Back to those super
 fit older people</i>

00:21:04.729 --> 00:21:06.331
<i> in their early studies?</i>

00:21:06.431 --> 00:21:08.366 align:start size:81% position:19%
<i> We found that individuals
 who were highly fit</i>

00:21:08.466 --> 00:21:10.435 align:start size:56% position:44%
<i> actually showed
 br-brain activity</i>

00:21:10.535 --> 00:21:12.070 align:start size:56% position:44%
very similar
to younger adults.

00:21:12.170 --> 00:21:13.538 align:start size:78% position:22% line:83%
That's to say,
they were only activating

00:21:13.638 --> 00:21:14.706 align:start size:69% position:31% line:85%
one side of the brain,

00:21:14.806 --> 00:21:16.308 align:start size:66% position:34% line:83%
and they were
inhibiting the other.

00:21:16.408 --> 00:21:18.076 align:start position:0% line:80%
<i>(Jaye)
Which is the way
it's supposed to be.</i>

00:21:16.408 --> 00:21:18.076 align:start size:13% position:88%
So--

00:21:18.176 --> 00:21:19.878 align:start size:63% position:38%
Which is the way
it's supposed to be.

00:21:21.946 --> 00:21:23.448 align:start size:81% position:19%
<i> (Jaye)
 So the question was,</i>

00:21:23.548 --> 00:21:26.284 align:start size:88% position:13%
<i> could they take sedentary
 older adults,</i>

00:21:26.384 --> 00:21:28.853 align:start size:72% position:28%
<i> and through
 exercise alone,</i>

00:21:28.953 --> 00:21:32.056 align:start size:97% position:3%
<i> make their brains function
 like a younger person's again?</i>

00:21:32.157 --> 00:21:34.292 align:start position:0%
<i>Doin' good?
Yeah, 98 and 93.</i>

00:21:34.392 --> 00:21:36.327 align:start position:0% line:91%
<i>Good, okay.</i>
I'm liking it.

00:21:36.427 --> 00:21:38.063 align:start size:78% position:22% line:80%
<i> (Jaye)
 Sixty-nine-year-old

00:21:41.099 --> 00:21:42.868 align:start size:38% position:63%
I get there.

00:21:42.968 --> 00:21:44.536 align:start size:75% position:25%
<i> (Jaye)

00:21:44.636 --> 00:21:46.037
Good girl.
Come on.

00:21:46.138 --> 00:21:47.572 align:start size:75% position:25%
<i> (Jaye)
 ...Smith knew she
 needed more than</i>

00:21:47.672 --> 00:21:51.676
<i> the occasional yoga class
 and playing with her dogs.</i>

00:21:51.776 --> 00:21:54.412
You went the wrong way.

00:21:54.512 --> 00:21:56.548 align:start size:84% position:16%
<i> (Jaye)
 Gayle's bike neighbor,
 Deidre Hurley,</i>

00:21:56.648 --> 00:21:58.716
<i> has a similar story.</i>

00:21:58.817 --> 00:22:01.886 align:start size:53% position:47%
I was once active
at a gym.

00:22:01.987 --> 00:22:04.389 align:start size:47% position:53%
But that was
many years ago.

00:22:04.489 --> 00:22:07.025 align:start position:0% line:83%
<i>(Jaye)
Like, how many?</i>

00:22:04.489 --> 00:22:07.025 align:start size:28% position:72%
And, um--

00:22:07.125 --> 00:22:08.260 align:start size:25% position:75%
Oh, gee.

00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:11.996 align:start size:38% position:63%
20-something
years ago.

00:22:12.096 --> 00:22:14.299 align:start size:78% position:22%
<i> (Jaye)
 Three times a week

00:22:14.399 --> 00:22:16.167 line:91%

00:22:16.267 --> 00:22:18.302 line:92%
<i> 20 to 45-minutes long.</i>

00:22:18.402 --> 00:22:20.238 line:91%
<i> It's an interval

00:22:20.338 --> 00:22:23.141 line:91%
<i> involving low and
 high intensity.</i>

00:22:23.241 --> 00:22:25.743 align:start position:0% line:85%
Ruth, heart rate?

00:22:23.241 --> 00:22:25.743 align:start size:9% position:91%
96.

00:22:25.843 --> 00:22:26.945 align:start position:0%
<i>Stella?</i>

00:22:27.045 --> 00:22:29.714 align:start size:63% position:38%
The idea is that
they're continuously
pushing themselves

00:22:29.814 --> 00:22:32.284 align:start size:81% position:19%
to be a little bit outside
of their comfort zone.

00:22:32.384 --> 00:22:33.418 align:start size:69% position:31%
And once they do that,

00:22:33.518 --> 00:22:36.087 align:start size:81% position:19%
they actually tend to show
growth or improvements

00:22:36.188 --> 00:22:39.257 align:start size:59% position:41%
like we see
in this program.

00:22:39.357 --> 00:22:41.393 align:start size:94% position:6%
<i> (Jaye)
 Changes in the brain are
 measured through blood tests</i>

00:22:41.493 --> 00:22:45.564 align:start size:94% position:6%
<i> taken before and after class,
 and brain imaging.</i>

00:22:45.664 --> 00:22:49.200
<i> In just 12 weeks,
 a stunning change.</i>

00:22:49.300 --> 00:22:51.336
Our research is showing that
the brain, after exercise,

00:22:51.436 --> 00:22:52.837
begins to show activity

00:22:52.937 --> 00:22:54.906
that's more similar to
that of a young person.

00:22:55.006 --> 00:22:58.210 align:start size:94% position:6%
<i> (Jaye)
 Brains that have been showing
 activity on both sides</i>

00:22:58.310 --> 00:23:01.279 align:start size:97% position:3%
<i> were now back to
 lighting up on one side again.</i>

00:23:01.379 --> 00:23:02.213
So in a sense, yeah,

00:23:02.313 --> 00:23:04.749 align:start size:81% position:19%
we are kinda turning
back the clock.

00:23:04.849 --> 00:23:07.752 align:start size:78% position:22%
<i> (Jaye)
 Turning back
 the clock how much?</i>

00:23:07.852 --> 00:23:08.719
It would be
fair to say

00:23:08.819 --> 00:23:10.789 align:start size:84% position:16%
about a five to
seven year improvement

00:23:10.889 --> 00:23:11.923
over the 12 weeks,

00:23:12.023 --> 00:23:15.360 align:start size:88% position:13%
is-is what a person
could reasonably expect,

00:23:15.460 --> 00:23:16.761
on average.

00:23:16.861 --> 00:23:19.564 align:start size:88% position:13%
<i> (Jaye)
 A brain functioning five
 to seven years younger</i>

00:23:19.664 --> 00:23:21.933
<i> after just 12 weeks.</i>

00:23:22.033 --> 00:23:24.902 align:start size:81% position:19%
<i> Results vary,
 because people vary,</i>

00:23:25.002 --> 00:23:28.907
<i> in biology and in effort.</i>

00:23:29.007 --> 00:23:31.709
<i> Ed Jones is a lifelong runner
 who was able to do the study</i>

00:23:31.810 --> 00:23:35.680 align:start size:88% position:13%
<i> after an injury left him
 unable to exercise.</i>

00:23:35.780 --> 00:23:37.983 align:start size:78% position:22%
<i> The results
 don't surprise him.</i>

00:23:38.083 --> 00:23:40.251 align:start position:0% line:83%
The American College
of Sports Medicine

00:23:40.351 --> 00:23:44.021 align:start position:0% line:83%
has a logo,
"Exercise is medicine."

00:23:44.122 --> 00:23:46.491 align:start position:0% line:83%
And I think they're
completely accurate on that.

00:23:46.591 --> 00:23:49.861 align:start position:0%
It's sorta the
magic bullet.

00:23:49.961 --> 00:23:52.397 align:start size:75% position:25%
<i> (Jaye)</i>
Magic that
requires effort.

00:23:52.497 --> 00:23:55.033
<i> But in a world where
 youth reigns supreme,</i>

00:23:55.133 --> 00:23:57.536
<i> and countless dollars
 are spent by people</i>

00:23:57.636 --> 00:24:00.472
<i> trying to turn
 back the clock,</i>

00:24:00.572 --> 00:24:03.908 align:start size:94% position:6%
<i> we can function as a younger
 version of ourselves</i>

00:24:04.008 --> 00:24:05.943
<i> by lacing up our shoes</i>

00:24:06.044 --> 00:24:09.080 align:start size:84% position:16%
<i> and getting back
 in the exercise saddle.</i>

00:24:12.884 --> 00:24:15.219
There are so many things
we cannot control in life,

00:24:15.319 --> 00:24:18.523
but that doesn't stop a lot
of us from trying anyway.

00:24:18.623 --> 00:24:21.592 align:start size:91% position:9%
This is the sort of science
that empowers us.

00:24:21.692 --> 00:24:23.027
The proof is there.

00:24:23.127 --> 00:24:27.165
Interval-aerobic exercise can
make your brain act younger.

00:24:27.265 --> 00:24:29.133
Who wouldn't want that?

00:24:29.233 --> 00:24:31.703 align:start size:94% position:6%
It does take away your excuse
to binge watch Netflix

00:24:31.803 --> 00:24:34.505 align:start size:81% position:19%
on your couch
while eating snacks.

00:24:34.606 --> 00:24:36.641
Loafing around
can feel good.

00:24:36.741 --> 00:24:40.612
But to change your brain,
you need to move your body.

00:24:40.712 --> 00:24:42.280
That's gonna do it
for us this week.

00:24:42.380 --> 00:24:45.917
We'll see you next time
on "Your Fantastic Mind."
