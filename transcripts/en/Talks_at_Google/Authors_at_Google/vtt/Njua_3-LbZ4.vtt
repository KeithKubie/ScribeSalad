[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:09.320
MATT BRITTIN: So please welcome,
enthusiastically and warmly,

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.960
Viv Groskop.

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.446
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:15.438 --> 00:00:16.434
VIV GROSKOP: Thank you.

00:00:16.434 --> 00:00:17.430
Hey.

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:18.426
Thank you, Matt.

00:00:18.426 --> 00:00:18.924
MATT BRITTIN: Thank
you very much.

00:00:18.924 --> 00:00:20.418
VIV GROSKOP: Thank you.

00:00:20.418 --> 00:00:23.910
Oh, in the spirit
of Google Translate,

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.905
I feel like I should
say [RUSSIAN]..

00:00:28.647 --> 00:00:30.480
MATT BRITTIN: Well,
that's very rude of you.

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.647
VIV GROSKOP: There any
Russian speakers in the room?

00:00:32.647 --> 00:00:34.380
Yeah.

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:34.920
So--

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:35.970
MATT BRITTIN: What
did you say there?

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:36.420
VIV GROSKOP: Hello.

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:36.840
Thank you.

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:37.340
I love you.

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:38.903
MATT BRITTIN: Oh.

00:00:38.903 --> 00:00:41.070
I can see this is going to
be a great chat with you.

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.810
VIV GROSKOP: Yeah.

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:45.300
MATT BRITTIN: Let's just
start with-- what do you mean,

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.300
owning the room?

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:47.790
What does that mean?

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:50.550
VIV GROSKOP: Well, you just
demonstrated it, actually,

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.280
with that little
slip-up that you had,

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.550
not being able to
say Anna Karenina.

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.150
So can you say it now?

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:01.665
MATT BRITTIN: No.

00:01:01.665 --> 00:01:03.540
VIV GROSKOP: Owning the
room is about feeling

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:07.200
really comfortable in the
spotlight, so comfortable

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.970
that you're OK with failing.

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.010
That's it, basically.

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.500
Because in everyday
life, when we're

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.360
talking to people, when we're
just moving through our lives,

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:18.660
we don't go around
thinking, oh, I'm

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:20.430
going to meet my
friend with coffee--

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.010
for coffee-- but I haven't
prepared anything to say.

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:25.680
You know, we move through
life very comfortably,

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.390
and we don't question ourselves.

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.090
But suddenly, when we're
in a position like--

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.160
not literally like
this, but sometimes,

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:34.680
literally like this-- where
we're in a spotlight--

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.440
but that spotlight can
feel like it comes anytime,

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:40.410
like in an interview
situation, job interview,

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:44.010
in a difficult conversation with
your boss, in a confrontation.

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:46.980
We can feel like we're
in that spotlight.

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:49.955
And that is the moment
when the adrenaline comes,

00:01:49.955 --> 00:01:51.580
and we have that
fight or flight, which

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:54.630
is very natural human reaction.

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.520
It's about learning how to
be comfortable with that,

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.170
control it, and feel like you're
just owning yourself in the way

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.110
that you do in normal moments.

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.870
I've gotten quite Paul
McKenna quite early on.

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:08.400
That's OK.

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:11.790
MATT BRITTIN: So we're
going to go into, I think--

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.290
get practical about
what you learned

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:14.748
and what you've
shared in the book.

00:02:14.748 --> 00:02:16.980
But before we do that, I
mentioned this idea of doing

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.870
a hundred stand-up
gigs in a hundred days,

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.780
which you did when you had
a child under one, I think--

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:23.618
VIV GROSKOP: Yes.

00:02:23.618 --> 00:02:25.660
MATT BRITTIN: --as If it
wasn't stressful enough.

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:27.120
Just tell us a bit
about, like, why

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.582
did you do-- why
did you do that?

00:02:28.582 --> 00:02:30.540
VIV GROSKOP: Well, some
people will do anything

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.410
to avoid bedtime
for small children,

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.510
and I was one of those people.

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.090
And what happened to me
was that, as you said,

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.910
I had a long and
very happy career

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.190
as a freelance journalist.

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.860
I started my career
in my early 20s,

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.233
working in old-school
Fleet Street, which

00:02:49.233 --> 00:02:51.150
lots of the beautiful
young people in the room

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.220
won't even remember.

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.953
So I had a office job
until I was about 25,

00:02:56.953 --> 00:02:59.370
working for places like "The
Daily Express" and "The Daily

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.540
Telegraph," and places I hated.

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:04.140
And that was a good experience
for me to be in a job I hated.

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.140
It made me go freelance.

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:09.600
And then I had about 10 years of
loving writing and freelancing.

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.863
And that was how I was able
to have my three children.

00:03:11.863 --> 00:03:14.280
I have three children, which
is an answer to the question,

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.100
how many children is too many.

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:20.340
And as I go into my mid 30s--

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.560
and I felt like I had a lot
of control over my life,

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.440
because I had a
lot of flexibility.

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:26.230
And I loved my work--

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:28.650
I began to realize that, as
my children were growing up,

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:30.270
I was telling them a lie.

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:31.980
So I was always
saying to them, do

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:33.390
what you want with your life.

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:34.410
Live your dreams.

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:36.810
Don't let other people
tell you what to do.

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:38.280
And the more I
said this to them,

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.810
the more I realized
it wasn't true for me,

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:43.240
and that the thing I'd
always wanted to do,

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:46.150
which was to perform,
to entertain,

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:50.370
to be in the spotlight-- to
really try stand-up comedy was

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:51.900
what I really wanted to do--

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.010
I'd never done it.

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:54.797
Because I was too damn chicken.

00:03:54.797 --> 00:03:55.380
I was chicken.

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:58.230
MATT BRITTIN: How did you know
that's what you wanted to do?

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:02.160
VIV GROSKOP: I had had an
idea from when I was a child.

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.010
People-- and again,
too young to remember--

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:07.000
the kids from "Fame"--

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.500
yeah?

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:08.370
1980s?

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:09.090
AUDIENCE: Yeah!

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:11.010
Yeah.

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:12.810
VIV GROSKOP: Doris Schwartz--

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:14.660
Doris Schwartz and
Bruno Martelli,

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:16.387
and the kids from
"Fame," Mr. Shorofsky--

00:04:16.387 --> 00:04:17.720
MATT BRITTIN: Yeah, [INAUDIBLE].

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:18.887
VIV GROSKOP: You were there.

00:04:18.887 --> 00:04:20.250
MATT BRITTIN: I was there.

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:21.769
Still got the leg warmers, yeah.

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:24.480
VIV GROSKOP: Doris Schwartz
was this character in this

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:29.190
mid-'80s, a woman stand-up
in the New York High School

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:30.990
of the Performing Arts.

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:33.800
And New Yorkers in
the room cringing.

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:36.540
And I loved her
when I was a child.

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:38.400
But I grew up in the
kind of environment

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.740
where my parents
later turned out

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:45.780
to be massive Brexit voters,
and like, quite sort of closed,

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:48.780
don't take any risks,
do not do anything

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:50.120
creative sort of environment.

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:51.480
So I was never--

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:53.590
I didn't feel I was able
to set that as a goal.

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:54.840
Like, I'd love to do stand-up.

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:55.830
I'd love to do acting.

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:57.460
If I could live my
life over again,

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:59.550
I would have done that
from a much younger age.

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:01.680
But instead, I kind of was
like, OK, well, maybe I

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:03.410
can be a writer.

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:05.490
And just through seeing
my own kids grow up

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:08.970
and realizing that life is too
short to stifle the stuff you

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:12.510
really want to do, I had to
acknowledge, yeah, actually,

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:14.460
I'm kind of hiding
behind this keyboard.

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:16.240
I'm hiding behind the words.

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:19.300
And I've got to get out
there and at least try.

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:23.080
And so I ended up doing some
workshops and all that kind

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:25.750
of stuff that you do
when you first try it,

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:28.180
and realizing that I loved it.

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:31.330
After the first workshop I ever
did in stand-up comedy when I

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:32.020
was 35--

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:32.980
I'm 45 now.

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:34.450
I know, it's amazing.

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:36.160
And I came home.

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:38.680
And my husband said
to me, after doing

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:40.970
three hours of this
stand-up training,

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:44.260
this is the most relaxed
I've seen you in 10 years.

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:47.440
And I knew I really
wanted to do it.

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:49.300
But then you learn
very quickly how hard

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:51.593
it is to actually do
it, and that if you

00:05:51.593 --> 00:05:53.260
are going to do it
seriously, you better

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.490
get to a hundred gigs fast.

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:58.412
And I just had my third
child, and he'd turned one.

00:05:58.412 --> 00:05:59.870
When he turned one,
I was like, OK,

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:01.537
you've had enough
attention from me now.

00:06:01.537 --> 00:06:04.070
I'm going out every night,
a hundred gigs in a hundred

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:04.570
nights.

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:06.130
And that was in 2011.

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:10.600
And since then, I've gone on
to do five shows at Edinburgh,

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:14.030
one-woman shows, and ended
up hosting book tours

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:17.440
for Graham Norton, Dawn French,
Jennifer Saunders, Jay Brand,

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:19.870
and moving into more
radio and TV work, which

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:21.410
is what I really wanted to do.

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:23.260
MATT BRITTIN: So it was a route
to something else in the end?

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:24.343
VIV GROSKOP: Yeah, it was.

00:06:24.343 --> 00:06:26.927
And I would-- if you'd have
said to me, 10 years ago,

00:06:26.927 --> 00:06:28.510
oh, you're going to
be doing stand-up,

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:32.140
and you're going to go on
stage with Graham Norton,

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:33.770
or any of these
people, and then you're

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:37.060
going to write a book for people
about how to own the room,

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:38.590
I would be like, no, thanks.

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:41.650
No, I don't really want--
that sounds horrible.

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:46.480
But as time went on, I realized
how much I'd learnt about all

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:48.910
of this, and that I really
wanted to pass it on to other

00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:51.670
people, and have this
discussion about--

00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:53.827
it's not an entirely
gendered discussion,

00:06:53.827 --> 00:06:55.660
and that's a really
important point to make.

00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:58.150
But I do think it's harder,
sometimes, for women

00:06:58.150 --> 00:06:59.260
to try these things.

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:03.150
And that's obviously a
huge conversation in comedy

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:04.780
is, why aren't
there as many women?

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:06.800
I think loads more women
are coming through now.

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:09.070
And the last 10 years has
seen a massive change.

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:11.490
But the numbers are
always really skewed.

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:13.840
And on the comedy
bill, you're often

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:16.180
the only woman out of six.

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:18.790
And you're generally going to
be the opener, like, the lowest

00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:22.610
status spot, all that stuff.

00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:26.720
So having learnt how to do
this on the fly late in life,

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:28.300
I wanted to pass it on.

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:29.800
And then I found
I was constantly

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:32.260
thinking, for the idea for
this book, and for the podcast,

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:36.700
where I interview lots of
women about all of this stuff--

00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:38.380
I was thinking, I
can't write that.

00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:40.750
Because who will listen to me?

00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:43.660
I can't-- I'm not famous.

00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:45.820
No one knew-- I'm not
a massively successful

00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:46.645
stand-up comedian.

00:07:46.645 --> 00:07:48.520
And I remember saying
to this friend of mine,

00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:51.190
who is a writer, I
can't write this book.

00:07:51.190 --> 00:07:54.290
This book should be
written by Joan Rivers.

00:07:54.290 --> 00:07:56.950
Like, Joan-- who would
want to read "How to Own

00:07:56.950 --> 00:07:58.030
the Room" by Joan Rivers?

00:07:58.030 --> 00:08:01.400
I mean, that would be the
most amazing book ever.

00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:03.550
And my friend just looked
at me and said, Viv,

00:08:03.550 --> 00:08:04.960
Joan Rivers is dead.

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:08.230
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:08.230 --> 00:08:11.200
And if she were
alive, she would not

00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:13.600
be bothered to write this book.

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:15.640
She is not a book-writing
kind of person,

00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:16.790
although she did
write a lot of books.

00:08:16.790 --> 00:08:18.623
But she would not wanted
to write this book.

00:08:18.623 --> 00:08:19.810
So this is your book.

00:08:19.810 --> 00:08:20.920
This is your idea.

00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:23.890
Put it out there and see
if people are interested.

00:08:23.890 --> 00:08:25.930
And the book came
out in November.

00:08:25.930 --> 00:08:29.140
I met you shortly
after it came out.

00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:31.900
And it's become a bestseller.

00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:33.860
It's sold in three countries.

00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:35.919
It's coming out in
Canada next week.

00:08:35.919 --> 00:08:38.590
The podcast has gone
top 10 on iTunes.

00:08:38.590 --> 00:08:40.669
Which, the podcast got
put together in two weeks,

00:08:40.669 --> 00:08:41.169
literally.

00:08:41.169 --> 00:08:45.230
Because Mary Portas, the retail
guru, came to me and said,

00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:46.810
how can I help you
with your book?

00:08:46.810 --> 00:08:49.220
And I said, well, it's
coming out in two weeks.

00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:52.540
So I can't interview
you for it or anything.

00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:56.020
How about I interview you
for the podcast, which

00:08:56.020 --> 00:08:57.940
doesn't actually
exist, but it will

00:08:57.940 --> 00:08:59.980
if you say yes to an interview?

00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:01.210
And she said yes.

00:09:01.210 --> 00:09:02.980
And so then, suddenly,
I had a podcast,

00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:04.660
which happened in two weeks.

00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:05.860
So--

00:09:05.860 --> 00:09:07.390
MATT BRITTIN: You are a woman on
a mission, though, aren't you,

00:09:07.390 --> 00:09:08.200
really?

00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:11.420
VIV GROSKOP: Yeah, because
this stuff is really important.

00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:14.883
And I've been really--

00:09:14.883 --> 00:09:17.300
I've had a lot of moments of
being really upset, actually,

00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:19.630
of what I-- the stories that
have come out from doing

00:09:19.630 --> 00:09:21.490
these kind of events.

00:09:21.490 --> 00:09:23.570
I do one-on-one
work with people.

00:09:23.570 --> 00:09:26.560
I do workshops where people can
come and have a clinic with me

00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:27.520
for 10 minutes.

00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:31.120
And I do little interventions
about presentation

00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:34.930
and confidence, and
men as well as women.

00:09:34.930 --> 00:09:36.910
But often, from
women-- like, the depth

00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:43.090
of people's insecurity and the
weight that they're carrying

00:09:43.090 --> 00:09:47.080
with them about, my
voice sounds weird,

00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:49.180
no one wants to
listen to my voice,

00:09:49.180 --> 00:09:51.528
I've got an annoying voice--

00:09:51.528 --> 00:09:53.320
I feel like I'm talking
about myself here--

00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:57.190
and all of these tiny,
little, niggling gremlins

00:09:57.190 --> 00:10:00.820
are so prevalent in everybody.

00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:02.860
And there's got to be a
way to talk about this

00:10:02.860 --> 00:10:03.910
and get rid of it.

00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:06.460
Because everybody thinks
it's personal to them,

00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:08.440
and they have this
specific problem that they

00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:09.940
would need some help with.

00:10:09.940 --> 00:10:10.990
And it's not.

00:10:10.990 --> 00:10:12.100
Everybody has it.

00:10:12.100 --> 00:10:13.142
MATT BRITTIN: Absolutely.

00:10:13.142 --> 00:10:14.450
So I want to get into the book.

00:10:14.450 --> 00:10:16.200
So one of the things
I love about the book

00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:19.630
is it's written in
chapters around people.

00:10:19.630 --> 00:10:24.472
And so "Be More Michelle
Obama" is the first chapter.

00:10:24.472 --> 00:10:25.180
VIV GROSKOP: Yes.

00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:25.972
MATT BRITTIN: And--

00:10:25.972 --> 00:10:28.108
VIV GROSKOP: Demonstrate
it now, Matt.

00:10:28.108 --> 00:10:31.594
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:32.895 --> 00:10:34.828
MATT BRITTIN: I'm doing it.

00:10:34.828 --> 00:10:35.370
I'm doing it.

00:10:35.370 --> 00:10:36.620
VIV GROSKOP: You actually are.

00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:37.330
You actually are.

00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:39.510
MATT BRITTIN: So I said,
to Viv, actually, I--

00:10:39.510 --> 00:10:42.242
that chapter is about something
called happy high status.

00:10:42.242 --> 00:10:43.950
And we'll ask you
about that in a second.

00:10:43.950 --> 00:10:46.770
But yesterday, I had those
three words in my mind

00:10:46.770 --> 00:10:49.710
when I went on stage at
a big technology, media,

00:10:49.710 --> 00:10:51.220
and telecoms event.

00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:53.340
And I was speaking
between the CEO of Sky,

00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:56.670
owned by Rupert Murdoch, and
the CEO of News Corp, owned

00:10:56.670 --> 00:10:57.950
by Rupert Murdoch.

00:10:57.950 --> 00:10:59.700
And I was thinking, I
know what these guys

00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:01.700
are going to say about
the technology companies.

00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:05.080
And I'm going to be more
Michelle Obama in between.

00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:07.150
And so thank you.

00:11:07.150 --> 00:11:07.650
But now--

00:11:07.650 --> 00:11:10.200
VIV GROSKOP: Did you
have a sleeveless--

00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:11.670
I love that.

00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:15.550
Did you wear a sleeveless to--

00:11:15.550 --> 00:11:16.050
no.

00:11:16.050 --> 00:11:16.590
MATT BRITTIN: I
haven't quite got that.

00:11:16.590 --> 00:11:18.650
VIV GROSKOP: OK, next
time-- next time.

00:11:18.650 --> 00:11:20.500
MATT BRITTIN: But
happy high status--

00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:20.880
VIV GROSKOP: Yeah.

00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:21.690
MATT BRITTIN: --that
is a great concept.

00:11:21.690 --> 00:11:22.690
Tell us about that.

00:11:22.690 --> 00:11:24.107
VIV GROSKOP: Yeah,
so when I first

00:11:24.107 --> 00:11:26.310
started training in
stand-up, and taking

00:11:26.310 --> 00:11:28.290
all of these workshops,
and trying to work out

00:11:28.290 --> 00:11:31.840
how I was going to
start doing this stuff,

00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:34.980
I came across this
idea in improv comedy

00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:37.360
called happy high status.

00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:42.870
And it's about the
moment where you

00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:46.200
are so open and
comfortable in a space

00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:48.870
that you can accept
disagreement.

00:11:48.870 --> 00:11:50.670
You can accept dissent.

00:11:50.670 --> 00:11:52.650
You can accept that the
person coming after you

00:11:52.650 --> 00:11:54.030
is going to trash you.

00:11:54.030 --> 00:11:56.250
You can take on haters
and be like, yeah,

00:11:56.250 --> 00:11:58.320
tell me more about
why you hate me,

00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:00.720
and be very open and
collegiate with it,

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:06.150
and allow everybody's viewpoints
to exist at any one time.

00:12:06.150 --> 00:12:07.800
I am personally not
very good at this,

00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:10.110
because I'm quite neurotic.

00:12:10.110 --> 00:12:12.780
But it's an energy
that you need to have,

00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:15.480
for example, if you're
MCing in comedy,

00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:18.120
where you might have to
switch the energy from one

00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:19.048
comedian to the next.

00:12:19.048 --> 00:12:21.090
You might have to bring
up the energy in the room

00:12:21.090 --> 00:12:24.090
or calm it down if
somebody was really crazy.

00:12:24.090 --> 00:12:27.330
And it's about being able to
feel your way into situations

00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:29.960
where you make sure
everybody feels unthreatened

00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:31.860
and everybody feels welcome.

00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:34.720
And Michelle Obama is
the expert of this.

00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:35.940
But the other example--

00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:37.600
to show it's not
gendered as well,

00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:39.615
the other example
is George Clooney.

00:12:39.615 --> 00:12:40.740
MATT BRITTIN: Tell us the--

00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:41.440
tell us the story.

00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:43.273
VIV GROSKOP: So the
story they use in improv

00:12:43.273 --> 00:12:45.880
about George Clooney, it's
supposed to be a made-up story.

00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:47.820
But I like to think
it's true and that it's

00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:49.290
going to happen to me one day.

00:12:49.290 --> 00:12:54.210
So you imagine that you are
going to a Hollywood party.

00:12:54.210 --> 00:12:56.550
It's the Oscars, and you're
going to the "Vanity Fair"

00:12:56.550 --> 00:12:59.380
party, which was recently
discredited by "The New York

00:12:59.380 --> 00:12:59.880
Times."

00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:02.260
But imagine it's
still in its heyday.

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:04.020
And you're going to
this fabulous party.

00:13:04.020 --> 00:13:05.580
Everybody's in black tie.

00:13:05.580 --> 00:13:06.150
You're late.

00:13:06.150 --> 00:13:08.400
Your meeting your friends,
who you really want to see.

00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:10.530
On the way in, you tap
a waiter on the shoulder

00:13:10.530 --> 00:13:12.300
to ask for a drink,
because you're late,

00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:13.285
and you're in a hurry.

00:13:13.285 --> 00:13:15.180
Oh, can you just get me a drink?

00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:16.398
You go and join your friends.

00:13:16.398 --> 00:13:17.940
The waiter comes
over with the drink.

00:13:17.940 --> 00:13:18.870
You turn around.

00:13:18.870 --> 00:13:20.790
It's George Clooney.

00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:24.210
And you mistook George
Clooney for a waiter,

00:13:24.210 --> 00:13:27.170
which, in a black tie
situation could happen, right?

00:13:27.170 --> 00:13:28.720
Matt, you move in these circles.

00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:29.220
This--

00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:30.090
MATT BRITTIN: I've done it--

00:13:30.090 --> 00:13:30.910
I've done it twice.

00:13:30.910 --> 00:13:31.702
VIV GROSKOP: Right.

00:13:31.702 --> 00:13:34.620
MATT BRITTIN: Don't do it
twice, that's all I'd say.

00:13:34.620 --> 00:13:36.510
VIV GROSKOP: And the
happy high status lesson

00:13:36.510 --> 00:13:39.730
is that George Clooney hands
you a cocktail, or your glass

00:13:39.730 --> 00:13:42.060
of champagne, or whatever,
without making you

00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:45.540
remotely feel small,
because he's George Clooney,

00:13:45.540 --> 00:13:47.460
and he can.

00:13:47.460 --> 00:13:49.080
And Michelle Obama
could do that.

00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:50.340
Barack Obama could do that.

00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:52.507
They're not going to turn
around and say, excuse me,

00:13:52.507 --> 00:13:54.060
I'm not a cocktail waiter.

00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:56.520
But to show you that
happy high status is not

00:13:56.520 --> 00:14:00.030
the same as high status,
the person you could not

00:14:00.030 --> 00:14:03.070
do that with is Donald Trump.

00:14:03.070 --> 00:14:07.420
So it's not about conferred
status or a business card.

00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:09.300
It's not about the
actual position

00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:11.680
that you occupy
in the hierarchy.

00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:15.708
It's about how you conduct
yourself with other people.

00:14:15.708 --> 00:14:17.500
MATT BRITTIN: I think
it's a great concept.

00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:19.260
Thank you for sharing that.

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:20.920
You mentioned Joan Ridges--

00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:21.600
Rivers.

00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:22.920
She's in your book as well--

00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:24.072
"Be More Joan Rivers."

00:14:24.072 --> 00:14:24.780
VIV GROSKOP: Yeah

00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:27.155
MATT BRITTIN: What do we do
when we want to be more Joan?

00:14:27.155 --> 00:14:28.920
VIV GROSKOP: Oh my
god, well, I was--

00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:33.570
it was tricky including Joan
Rivers in this, actually,

00:14:33.570 --> 00:14:36.360
particularly because she's an
example of somebody, I think,

00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:40.200
whose comedy would not exist
anymore nowadays, because woke,

00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:41.970
she ain't.

00:14:41.970 --> 00:14:47.190
So I wanted to include her
as an example of a person who

00:14:47.190 --> 00:14:51.720
is everything we're told, men
and women, we shouldn't be.

00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:53.980
So we shouldn't talk too fast.

00:14:53.980 --> 00:14:56.760
We must make sure that we
speak in a measured way.

00:14:56.760 --> 00:14:58.710
We must-- lots of
women are always

00:14:58.710 --> 00:15:02.700
saying, should I lower my tone
so that people can hear-- no.

00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:05.160
No, just speak like
a normal person.

00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:07.760
And Joan Rivers breaks
a lot of these rules.

00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:10.320
OK, she can, because
she's a stand-up comedian.

00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:13.500
But she's a person who
speaks way too fast, who

00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:15.420
has way too much energy.

00:15:15.420 --> 00:15:17.460
You can barely sort
of keep up with what

00:15:17.460 --> 00:15:19.170
she's saying supposedly.

00:15:19.170 --> 00:15:22.240
And yet you never
miss a single word.

00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:24.570
So I wanted to include
lots of examples,

00:15:24.570 --> 00:15:27.000
in the book, of women
who break the rules.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.340
Because there's a lot
of these kind of fake,

00:15:29.340 --> 00:15:32.270
bullshit rules around
speaking, and presenting,

00:15:32.270 --> 00:15:35.660
and how we come across to people
that-- we all know, in reality,

00:15:35.660 --> 00:15:38.780
we all have, even within our
day-to-day lives in work, like,

00:15:38.780 --> 00:15:40.610
managers who--

00:15:40.610 --> 00:15:43.330
they're not a
stereotypical manager.

00:15:43.330 --> 00:15:45.620
They are actually, maybe,
a bit more introverted

00:15:45.620 --> 00:15:47.180
than you would expect.

00:15:47.180 --> 00:15:48.680
Or they're somebody
who's a bit more

00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:50.687
relaxed in a corporate
culture than you.

00:15:50.687 --> 00:15:52.520
There are always people
who break the rules.

00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:55.550
And for me, it's really
important to try and find

00:15:55.550 --> 00:15:57.920
your own energy
and your own style

00:15:57.920 --> 00:15:59.580
by looking at those
people and saying,

00:15:59.580 --> 00:16:03.140
oh, that's not orthodox, how
are they getting away with that?

00:16:03.140 --> 00:16:04.623
That's really interesting to me.

00:16:04.623 --> 00:16:06.290
MATT BRITTIN: So we're
working on trying

00:16:06.290 --> 00:16:09.050
to get a workshop
lined up so people

00:16:09.050 --> 00:16:11.810
can experience this in
practice, which would be great.

00:16:11.810 --> 00:16:14.480
So look out for dates on that.

00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:16.760
But what do you
most often find when

00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:18.050
you're working with people?

00:16:18.050 --> 00:16:20.292
Is there's something that's
a really common issue

00:16:20.292 --> 00:16:22.250
that you have to encourage
people to deal with?

00:16:22.250 --> 00:16:25.307
Or has everybody got their
own different challenges?

00:16:25.307 --> 00:16:27.140
VIV GROSKOP: There's
one very specific thing

00:16:27.140 --> 00:16:30.230
I want to mention, because I've
noticed you doing it, Matt.

00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:31.610
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:31.610 --> 00:16:35.450
So it's really interesting.

00:16:35.450 --> 00:16:38.480
We had lunch in
your lovely canteen

00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:40.040
before we came on stage.

00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:42.200
And you were talking--

00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:43.195
he's really worried.

00:16:43.195 --> 00:16:43.820
No, you're not.

00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:45.195
Because you're
happy high status,

00:16:45.195 --> 00:16:47.530
so you're not worried about
what I'm going to say or do.

00:16:47.530 --> 00:16:48.030
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:48.030 --> 00:16:48.680
So you're OK.

00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:49.305
You're OK.

00:16:49.305 --> 00:16:50.180
MATT BRITTIN: OK, OK.

00:16:50.180 --> 00:16:52.910
VIV GROSKOP: So we were
talking in a group of about 10

00:16:52.910 --> 00:16:57.080
of us, in an informal
conversational situation.

00:16:57.080 --> 00:16:59.630
And you, and lots
of other people

00:16:59.630 --> 00:17:02.880
in the group, and probably me
as well, when we're talking,

00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:04.550
we tend to talk
like this, and say

00:17:04.550 --> 00:17:06.829
what's been going on in
our week, and everything

00:17:06.829 --> 00:17:08.974
that we say goes up at
the end of every sentence.

00:17:08.974 --> 00:17:10.849
And I was really interested
because I noticed

00:17:10.849 --> 00:17:13.050
you were doing it as well.

00:17:13.050 --> 00:17:15.470
And I often say, oh,
this is something

00:17:15.470 --> 00:17:19.099
that's very common to
women and younger women.

00:17:19.099 --> 00:17:21.319
And I was very
interested to notice

00:17:21.319 --> 00:17:26.510
that you followed that
inflection as well, which

00:17:26.510 --> 00:17:30.050
is totally useful
and appropriate

00:17:30.050 --> 00:17:32.520
in a conversational setting.

00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:35.540
However, lots of
people then transfer

00:17:35.540 --> 00:17:40.730
that into a formal interview
presentation situation,

00:17:40.730 --> 00:17:44.060
and it makes everything you
say sound like a suggestion,

00:17:44.060 --> 00:17:45.890
and it weakens your power.

00:17:45.890 --> 00:17:50.032
And it's the one thing that
everybody needs to work on.

00:17:50.032 --> 00:17:52.490
Because if I stop talking to
you like (RAISING PITCH) this,

00:17:52.490 --> 00:17:54.720
you don't know if I really
mean what I'm (RAISING PITCH)

00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:55.220
saying.

00:17:55.220 --> 00:17:56.750
And last weekend,
I went to Paris,

00:17:56.750 --> 00:17:58.542
and my husband named
(RAISING PITCH) Simon.

00:17:58.542 --> 00:18:01.880
Did I even know my husband's
(RAISING PITCH) name?

00:18:04.730 --> 00:18:06.200
And it's really
interesting to me

00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:08.390
that you were talking like that.

00:18:08.390 --> 00:18:11.810
Because this kind of
talking is actually

00:18:11.810 --> 00:18:16.460
necessary for forging
bonds and for showing this

00:18:16.460 --> 00:18:18.090
isn't a formal situation.

00:18:18.090 --> 00:18:19.400
We're having a normal chat.

00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:20.480
This is day to day.

00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:22.790
But the moments where
you are in the spotlight,

00:18:22.790 --> 00:18:27.740
and you want to step up and
be heard, move out of that,

00:18:27.740 --> 00:18:29.870
"hey we're just hanging
out in the canteen

00:18:29.870 --> 00:18:32.895
and having some laska."

00:18:32.895 --> 00:18:34.240
It was quite a nice laksa.

00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:34.880
MATT BRITTIN: It
was a fun lunch.

00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:35.410
VIV GROSKOP: It was a good one.

00:18:35.410 --> 00:18:36.350
It was a fun lunch.

00:18:36.350 --> 00:18:37.250
So it's--

00:18:37.250 --> 00:18:38.810
MATT BRITTIN: We shouldn't have
had that second vodka, though.

00:18:38.810 --> 00:18:39.477
VIV GROSKOP: No.

00:18:39.477 --> 00:18:40.340
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:40.340 --> 00:18:45.200
It's recognizing the difference
between conversational speech

00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:47.498
and more formal.

00:18:47.498 --> 00:18:49.040
MATT BRITTIN: OK,
thank you for that.

00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:52.113
You made me feel uneasy
there, but thank you.

00:18:52.113 --> 00:18:53.530
VIV GROSKOP: That
was intentional.

00:18:53.530 --> 00:18:55.460
MATT BRITTIN: Now, can
I you another question?

00:18:55.460 --> 00:18:57.260
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:58.610 --> 00:19:01.280
VIV GROSKOP: You see,
there, it is a question.

00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:04.010
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:04.010 --> 00:19:05.643
MATT BRITTIN: I'm
really confused.

00:19:05.643 --> 00:19:07.060
So what I'm going
to do, I'm going

00:19:07.060 --> 00:19:09.900
to come to you for
questions in a moment.

00:19:09.900 --> 00:19:13.070
So please come to
the mic in a second.

00:19:13.070 --> 00:19:14.480
VIV GROSKOP: Can
I say something?

00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:18.330
Funny as well-- say
that I'm embarrassed.

00:19:18.330 --> 00:19:21.427
So Matt and I, we don't
really know each other.

00:19:21.427 --> 00:19:22.510
MATT BRITTIN: That's true.

00:19:25.190 --> 00:19:26.990
VIV GROSKOP: But
we are neighbors.

00:19:26.990 --> 00:19:32.300
We live two minutes' walk
apart, and our children

00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:34.980
have been at the same school--

00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:36.540
there at different times.

00:19:36.540 --> 00:19:39.920
And I have known for a
while there is this guy--

00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:43.550
I live in Teddington-- there's
this guy who lives locally

00:19:43.550 --> 00:19:47.418
who works for Google, Matt
from Google, and he's a parent.

00:19:47.418 --> 00:19:49.460
MATT BRITTIN: Where are
you going with this, Viv?

00:19:49.460 --> 00:19:50.200
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:56.030
VIV GROSKOP: And so then I
met Matt at a friend's party.

00:19:56.030 --> 00:19:58.280
And I'm like, oh yeah, he's
the guy, Matt from Google,

00:19:58.280 --> 00:20:01.040
who lives here.

00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:02.085
And we talked about this.

00:20:02.085 --> 00:20:02.960
MATT BRITTIN: We did.

00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:05.060
VIV GROSKOP: And you said, oh,
I'm really interested in this.

00:20:05.060 --> 00:20:07.340
This is so important for
people to talk about this.

00:20:07.340 --> 00:20:09.930
Can you come around
and chat about it?

00:20:09.930 --> 00:20:12.830
And so I go round to-- he
invites me around to his house

00:20:12.830 --> 00:20:14.040
so we can chat about it.

00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:15.990
I'm thinking, oh yeah,
Matt from Google,

00:20:15.990 --> 00:20:18.230
he's a parent at the school.

00:20:18.230 --> 00:20:23.332
And on the way, I thought, I'm
just going to check who he is.

00:20:23.332 --> 00:20:25.140
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:35.200
And I was Googling,
I was like, oh, OK.

00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:36.555
Yeah, so--

00:20:36.555 --> 00:20:38.430
MATT BRITTIN: What was
it that came up that--

00:20:38.430 --> 00:20:39.222
VIV GROSKOP: Well--

00:20:39.222 --> 00:20:41.100
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:41.100 --> 00:20:42.250
I was, "oh, I see."

00:20:42.250 --> 00:20:43.940
MATT BRITTIN: Google's not
very kind to me, actually.

00:20:43.940 --> 00:20:44.982
VIV GROSKOP: Well, no no.

00:20:44.982 --> 00:20:46.600
I don't mean that
something came up.

00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:49.600
I just mean I then
realized who you were.

00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:52.030
Because I was thinking I was
just going to meet this guy

00:20:52.030 --> 00:20:55.300
called Matt who's from Google.

00:20:55.300 --> 00:20:56.320
Yeah.

00:20:56.320 --> 00:20:59.407
MATT BRITTIN: So can I
ask you another question?

00:20:59.407 --> 00:21:00.490
VIV GROSKOP: Yes, you can.

00:21:00.490 --> 00:21:03.530
MATT BRITTIN: OK, so thank
you very much for that story.

00:21:03.530 --> 00:21:04.227
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:04.227 --> 00:21:05.560
VIV GROSKOP: You didn't like it.

00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:07.935
MATT BRITTIN: So something
else you mentioned in the book

00:21:07.935 --> 00:21:09.670
and I think people
will have maybe heard

00:21:09.670 --> 00:21:14.020
of before is like how
your physical posture can

00:21:14.020 --> 00:21:16.960
help you or hinder you in
these settings as well.

00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:20.122
And you have a chapter,
"Be More Amy Cuddy."

00:21:20.122 --> 00:21:21.330
She's a body language expert.

00:21:21.330 --> 00:21:22.100
And I was going
through the book,

00:21:22.100 --> 00:21:24.520
actually, I was watching each
of these people on YouTube

00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:25.312
and what you meant.

00:21:25.312 --> 00:21:27.850
It's really interesting to read
the book and see the stuff.

00:21:27.850 --> 00:21:30.690
So what does she teach us?

00:21:30.690 --> 00:21:31.600
And tell us about--

00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:34.330
VIV GROSKOP: Amy
Cuddy is probably

00:21:34.330 --> 00:21:36.730
somebody lots of people
in the room will know.

00:21:36.730 --> 00:21:39.580
She has one of the
most-watched TED Talks

00:21:39.580 --> 00:21:43.300
ever, about power poses.

00:21:43.300 --> 00:21:44.882
Shall we embrace this, Matt?

00:21:44.882 --> 00:21:45.590
MATT BRITTIN: OK.

00:21:45.590 --> 00:21:46.780
VIV GROSKOP: OK.

00:21:46.780 --> 00:21:47.960
Oh, you see?

00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:50.500
Right, so if people haven't
watched this TED Talk,

00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:51.800
it's from about five years ago.

00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:54.070
It's now at about
50 million views.

00:21:54.070 --> 00:21:56.710
And Amy Cuddy, she has a
book called "Presence," which

00:21:56.710 --> 00:21:58.500
is all about body language.

00:21:58.500 --> 00:22:01.150
But it's more about
how your body language

00:22:01.150 --> 00:22:03.760
affects how you feel
inside rather than

00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:06.520
how it affects how you come
across to other people.

00:22:06.520 --> 00:22:15.610
So power poses are Wonder
Woman, Usain Bolt--

00:22:15.610 --> 00:22:21.380
very nice-- and the one
I call City Banker, this.

00:22:21.380 --> 00:22:23.180
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:23.180 --> 00:22:24.040
Yeah.

00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:29.140
And the whole point of the power
poses is opening up your body.

00:22:29.140 --> 00:22:31.480
And her TED Talk
explains that if you

00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:35.140
hold these poses in
a private place--

00:22:35.140 --> 00:22:36.975
not in your meeting,
(AGGRESSIVELY)

00:22:36.975 --> 00:22:39.190
hello-- and you go
to a private place,

00:22:39.190 --> 00:22:41.830
and you hold this pose
for at least two minutes,

00:22:41.830 --> 00:22:44.560
it changes the
chemicals in your brain.

00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:46.540
That's what her research showed.

00:22:46.540 --> 00:22:49.400
It's very interesting, because
that was five years ago,

00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:53.240
and then that went viral, and
led to a book, and everything.

00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:55.150
And since then, of
course, because she's

00:22:55.150 --> 00:22:58.530
popular neuroscience, all
the other neuroscientists

00:22:58.530 --> 00:23:01.540
said, actually, no, there
is not enough evidence

00:23:01.540 --> 00:23:03.400
to show the chemicals
in the brain,

00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:06.310
and your sample size
is very small, and--

00:23:06.310 --> 00:23:09.110
it's been a bit of
a sad kind of thing.

00:23:09.110 --> 00:23:12.470
But for me, these power
poses really work.

00:23:12.470 --> 00:23:14.900
I don't care if the real
science is there or not.

00:23:14.900 --> 00:23:15.500
I've done it.

00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:16.510
It works.

00:23:16.510 --> 00:23:18.190
And it makes a lot
of sense to me,

00:23:18.190 --> 00:23:20.716
of this opening up of the body.

00:23:20.716 --> 00:23:22.180
Not for public consumption.

00:23:22.180 --> 00:23:24.430
So it's not about how you
come across to other people,

00:23:24.430 --> 00:23:29.260
but for fooling yourself
into, oh, I've got this.

00:23:29.260 --> 00:23:32.590
And that feeling of Usain Bolt
crossing the finishing line

00:23:32.590 --> 00:23:34.810
is the feeling
of, I've got this.

00:23:34.810 --> 00:23:37.960
And it's very hard if
you've been, and stood,

00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:39.730
in a dressing
room, in a toilet--

00:23:39.730 --> 00:23:43.850
and standing over
there, I was like this--

00:23:43.850 --> 00:23:46.570
it totally calms
you and takes away

00:23:46.570 --> 00:23:50.505
any feelings of smallness and
nerves that you might have.

00:23:50.505 --> 00:23:52.880
MATT BRITTIN: And something
else you touch on in the book

00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:56.920
is that people take their
cue from you, in terms

00:23:56.920 --> 00:24:00.460
of if you're on stage,
and you're nervous,

00:24:00.460 --> 00:24:02.380
and there are
tensions on yourself.

00:24:02.380 --> 00:24:05.470
VIV GROSKOP: You see the
difference in how someone

00:24:05.470 --> 00:24:10.100
comes across when they do this.

00:24:10.100 --> 00:24:12.110
It's so important.

00:24:12.110 --> 00:24:16.570
So if you go into a situation
with this bigger energy,

00:24:16.570 --> 00:24:19.270
I think we're frightened of
this because we don't want

00:24:19.270 --> 00:24:21.430
to come across as an asshole.

00:24:21.430 --> 00:24:22.090
Can I say--

00:24:22.090 --> 00:24:23.200
I've said it now.

00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:24.580
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:24.580 --> 00:24:28.000
We don't want to come
across as that person.

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:31.545
Nobody wants to be
that person who--

00:24:31.545 --> 00:24:33.670
nobody really wants to be
like, (AGGRESSIVELY) hey,

00:24:33.670 --> 00:24:35.200
I own the room.

00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:37.040
Nobody wants to be that person.

00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:40.250
So we're scared of that
openness and that--

00:24:40.250 --> 00:24:45.310
but in fact, most people, they
just need a bit more of that

00:24:45.310 --> 00:24:47.180
and a bit less of this.

00:24:47.180 --> 00:24:49.300
And don't be afraid
to overdo it.

00:24:49.300 --> 00:24:52.030
You can always rein it back in.

00:24:52.030 --> 00:24:55.210
But we're so afraid that we
go too far the other way,

00:24:55.210 --> 00:24:56.700
and we don't lead.

00:24:56.700 --> 00:25:00.280
And then other people, they
do take their cue from you

00:25:00.280 --> 00:25:01.660
in all things--

00:25:01.660 --> 00:25:04.900
how you enter a stage,
how you enter a room.

00:25:04.900 --> 00:25:07.383
That, they will meet you
with the same energy.

00:25:07.383 --> 00:25:09.925
MATT BRITTIN: Do please come to
the microphone, because-- oh,

00:25:09.925 --> 00:25:11.440
there we go, fantastic.

00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:14.687
I'm terrified I'm just going to
get an interrogation, or more.

00:25:14.687 --> 00:25:15.520
Thank you very much.

00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:16.020
Go ahead.

00:25:16.020 --> 00:25:17.480
AUDIENCE: Hi, thank you so much.

00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:19.580
I really enjoyed the talk.

00:25:19.580 --> 00:25:23.890
I have a question around how you
started, in terms of failure.

00:25:23.890 --> 00:25:26.140
Actually you mentioned
that owning the room

00:25:26.140 --> 00:25:28.410
is being comfortable
with failing.

00:25:28.410 --> 00:25:30.100
And I guess my
question is, especially

00:25:30.100 --> 00:25:32.590
because you do stand-up
comedy, have you

00:25:32.590 --> 00:25:35.850
ever failed when you've
actually owned the room?

00:25:35.850 --> 00:25:38.050
And what was it like to
kind of pick yourself up

00:25:38.050 --> 00:25:42.620
from that point and actually
take control of the room again?

00:25:42.620 --> 00:25:44.590
And if it was even in
the same situation,

00:25:44.590 --> 00:25:47.037
or if it was when
you came back to it.

00:25:47.037 --> 00:25:48.870
VIV GROSKOP: I almost
didn't listen to the--

00:25:48.870 --> 00:25:50.650
I did listen to the
question, but I almost

00:25:50.650 --> 00:25:52.358
didn't listen to the
question because you

00:25:52.358 --> 00:25:55.790
have a great tone,
and great presence,

00:25:55.790 --> 00:25:58.930
and no uptalk unless
it's a question.

00:25:58.930 --> 00:25:59.575
Very lovely.

00:25:59.575 --> 00:26:01.030
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:01.030 --> 00:26:02.920
But the question is--

00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:04.870
we all have so much to learn--

00:26:04.870 --> 00:26:08.260
the question is what
constitutes failure,

00:26:08.260 --> 00:26:11.860
and how have I
recovered from that?

00:26:11.860 --> 00:26:16.590
In stand-up, you learn
nothing unless you fail.

00:26:16.590 --> 00:26:18.510
And it's like any--

00:26:18.510 --> 00:26:20.610
I'm not saying stand-up
is an artistic endeavor.

00:26:20.610 --> 00:26:22.510
I think it's a bit
pretentious to say that.

00:26:22.510 --> 00:26:25.860
But in any creative
endeavor or something

00:26:25.860 --> 00:26:27.420
where you're giving
people something

00:26:27.420 --> 00:26:30.450
that they didn't actually ask
for, that's always the really

00:26:30.450 --> 00:26:33.210
interesting thing, is
that you're trying to say,

00:26:33.210 --> 00:26:36.300
you didn't ask for this, or
you're not expecting this,

00:26:36.300 --> 00:26:38.010
but look, you're
going to like it.

00:26:38.010 --> 00:26:41.070
That is always a huge risk
and constitutes as failure.

00:26:41.070 --> 00:26:46.720
So many times I would
fail very badly.

00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:49.400
I remember the first time I
ever did a Saturday night gig--

00:26:49.400 --> 00:26:50.590
and that's a big deal.

00:26:50.590 --> 00:26:53.130
And when I was trying to do
my 100 gigs in 100 nights,

00:26:53.130 --> 00:26:56.290
I could never get Saturday
nights booked, because that's

00:26:56.290 --> 00:26:59.360
the night when people pay a lot
of money to see professionals,

00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:01.490
and I was not a
professional then.

00:27:01.490 --> 00:27:03.342
And I'd be missing a night.

00:27:03.342 --> 00:27:05.550
Because I was doing 100
gigs, 100 consecutive nights.

00:27:05.550 --> 00:27:08.370
That would mean I'd have
to do two the next night.

00:27:08.370 --> 00:27:10.230
Or if I missed three
Saturdays, then I'd

00:27:10.230 --> 00:27:12.300
have to do three
on one other night.

00:27:12.300 --> 00:27:14.760
And so I was desperate to
get this Saturday night gig,

00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:16.980
and I got it, and I was opening.

00:27:16.980 --> 00:27:22.500
And I did material that I'd
done maybe 20 or 30 gigs before,

00:27:22.500 --> 00:27:25.680
a five-minute slot, that
had gone really well,

00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:26.638
and I knew was good.

00:27:26.638 --> 00:27:27.180
It was solid.

00:27:27.180 --> 00:27:29.430
It was gold-- solid gold.

00:27:29.430 --> 00:27:33.400
And it absolutely bombed in
a room of about 200 people.

00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:35.010
That's a lot of silence.

00:27:35.010 --> 00:27:39.410
And it was a full-on tumbleweed
for the whole of the time.

00:27:39.410 --> 00:27:42.960
And I had no skills
and no experience

00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:44.580
of knowing how to
turn that around.

00:27:44.580 --> 00:27:47.440
And my head split
into three parts.

00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:50.550
The first part is the
front of my head--

00:27:50.550 --> 00:27:54.270
keep talking, keep talking,
just keep going, keep going.

00:27:54.270 --> 00:27:57.900
Middle part-- think of
something else to say.

00:27:57.900 --> 00:27:59.970
Find something-- no,
there isn't anything.

00:27:59.970 --> 00:28:01.800
Think-- no-- try-- no--

00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:03.435
what-- nothing comes.

00:28:03.435 --> 00:28:05.310
And the back part of my
head, the third part,

00:28:05.310 --> 00:28:09.210
was like, why don't you decide
what method of suicide you're

00:28:09.210 --> 00:28:13.410
going to use when this is over?

00:28:13.410 --> 00:28:16.320
Because you will not
want to live in society

00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:19.890
any longer because you
have shamed yourself.

00:28:19.890 --> 00:28:21.510
And it was really,
really horrific.

00:28:21.510 --> 00:28:22.650
And it was a painful death.

00:28:22.650 --> 00:28:24.180
Because lots of
the other deaths--

00:28:24.180 --> 00:28:28.510
I've had mini deaths, open mic,
where there's a workshop vibe,

00:28:28.510 --> 00:28:30.510
it's much easier, the
audience knows you're new.

00:28:30.510 --> 00:28:32.218
But this was my first
professional thing,

00:28:32.218 --> 00:28:34.650
and I fluffed it.

00:28:34.650 --> 00:28:37.020
And I went to the
back of the room

00:28:37.020 --> 00:28:40.357
after I'd finished, and
walked off stage to like--

00:28:40.357 --> 00:28:41.690
[IMITATING VERY SPARSE APPLAUSE]

00:28:41.690 --> 00:28:43.420
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:43.420 --> 00:28:45.070
Walk of shame.

00:28:45.070 --> 00:28:48.820
And I said to this comedian
at the back of the room, what

00:28:48.820 --> 00:28:50.950
am I doing wrong?

00:28:50.950 --> 00:28:52.660
What am I doing wrong?

00:28:52.660 --> 00:28:53.750
Is it what I'm wearing?

00:28:53.750 --> 00:28:54.670
Is it my hair?

00:28:54.670 --> 00:28:56.900
Is my voice--

00:28:56.900 --> 00:29:00.148
I couldn't understand why it
worked once but not that time.

00:29:00.148 --> 00:29:02.190
And he looked at me, and
I thought, oh, wow, he's

00:29:02.190 --> 00:29:03.815
going to say something
so profound now.

00:29:03.815 --> 00:29:05.770
It's going to change everything.

00:29:05.770 --> 00:29:09.070
And he said, just be funny.

00:29:09.070 --> 00:29:10.405
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:14.140 --> 00:29:17.470
And I did walk home in
tears, and I was still

00:29:17.470 --> 00:29:19.600
crying the next morning.

00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:21.800
But after a while I learned.

00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:23.800
Especially because then
I was doing my 100 gigs,

00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:25.870
and that was a trick
of the 100 gigs.

00:29:25.870 --> 00:29:27.800
That was like number 27.

00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:29.870
Well, tomorrow is number 28.

00:29:29.870 --> 00:29:31.390
Let it go.

00:29:31.390 --> 00:29:33.110
So I had to go back
and do another one.

00:29:33.110 --> 00:29:35.690
And then the next it was fine.

00:29:35.690 --> 00:29:37.510
And the thing is, he was right.

00:29:37.510 --> 00:29:39.610
Just be funny.

00:29:39.610 --> 00:29:45.160
Just fail, learn from it,
try again, and just be.

00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:47.040
But you know, that's
a stupid thing to say.

00:29:47.040 --> 00:29:48.470
It's like saying, just relax.

00:29:48.470 --> 00:29:51.580
But the reality is
just force yourself

00:29:51.580 --> 00:29:56.060
through difficult situations,
accept it as a learning curve.

00:29:56.060 --> 00:29:58.120
And I wish I hadn't
put myself through so

00:29:58.120 --> 00:30:00.040
much personal torture.

00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:03.040
Because what I was experiencing
was not really personal to me.

00:30:03.040 --> 00:30:04.480
It was the process.

00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:07.960
Process is failure and
learning from failure.

00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:08.800
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:09.967
VIV GROSKOP: You're welcome.

00:30:09.967 --> 00:30:12.070
MATT BRITTIN: Wow.

00:30:12.070 --> 00:30:14.920
AUDIENCE: My question was just
around humor, and how important

00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:16.540
you feel that is.

00:30:16.540 --> 00:30:19.300
I guess it's one of those things
you imagine you either innately

00:30:19.300 --> 00:30:21.130
have it or you don't.

00:30:21.130 --> 00:30:23.380
So would you suggest
that people should

00:30:23.380 --> 00:30:25.740
learn to be humorous,
or use humor,

00:30:25.740 --> 00:30:27.380
or is that the only tool?

00:30:27.380 --> 00:30:28.240
What would you say?

00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:30.340
VIV GROSKOP: Oh, what
a lovely question.

00:30:30.340 --> 00:30:32.980
Well there are two
parts to this question.

00:30:32.980 --> 00:30:35.920
Number one is, do you
have to be born funny?

00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:38.530
And I think some people
are naturally funny,

00:30:38.530 --> 00:30:41.410
and they can channel
that in different ways.

00:30:41.410 --> 00:30:44.560
Being naturally funny in
life doesn't necessarily

00:30:44.560 --> 00:30:47.140
translate to being
funny as a performer.

00:30:47.140 --> 00:30:52.090
And there are lots of performers
who are really awkward in life.

00:30:52.090 --> 00:30:53.110
There really are.

00:30:53.110 --> 00:30:56.890
And there are lots of people who
are very funny in life, who you

00:30:56.890 --> 00:30:58.570
put them in a
stand-up situation,

00:30:58.570 --> 00:31:01.190
and you're actually
working from a script.

00:31:01.190 --> 00:31:02.920
And that's a whole
different discipline.

00:31:02.920 --> 00:31:05.650
So knowing what's
funny on stage is not

00:31:05.650 --> 00:31:08.550
the same as knowing
what's funny in life.

00:31:08.550 --> 00:31:12.100
But I don't think that you're
necessarily born with it

00:31:12.100 --> 00:31:13.150
or not born with it.

00:31:13.150 --> 00:31:16.840
I think you can allow
yourself to play.

00:31:16.840 --> 00:31:21.190
Because a lot of it is about
accessing your childhood self.

00:31:21.190 --> 00:31:23.710
Because when we're kids,
we're all pretty funny, right?

00:31:23.710 --> 00:31:24.970
All kids are funny.

00:31:24.970 --> 00:31:26.260
Kids are funny.

00:31:26.260 --> 00:31:27.350
Have kids.

00:31:27.350 --> 00:31:30.175
Yeah, let that be the
message for you today.

00:31:30.175 --> 00:31:30.925
MATT BRITTIN: Two.

00:31:30.925 --> 00:31:31.900
VIV GROSKOP: Two, yeah.

00:31:31.900 --> 00:31:34.060
Happy International
Women's Day, have children.

00:31:34.060 --> 00:31:35.386
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:36.270 --> 00:31:38.394
No, use contraception,
that's the message.

00:31:38.394 --> 00:31:39.810
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:41.460 --> 00:31:43.258
Sorry, Matt.

00:31:43.258 --> 00:31:46.470
MATT BRITTIN: What
was the question?

00:31:46.470 --> 00:31:48.010
VIV GROSKOP: Yeah,
kids are funny.

00:31:48.010 --> 00:31:51.130
And when we're kids, we play,
and we make each other laugh,

00:31:51.130 --> 00:31:53.380
and we're silly,
and we don't care.

00:31:53.380 --> 00:31:55.210
And then round
about the age of--

00:31:55.210 --> 00:31:58.450
parents will recognize
this age of 7, 8, 9,

00:31:58.450 --> 00:32:02.500
what they call the social
editor starts to kick in.

00:32:02.500 --> 00:32:05.710
And the social editor is the
person who makes you think,

00:32:05.710 --> 00:32:08.830
inside, oh, no, what
if other people think

00:32:08.830 --> 00:32:10.310
I said the wrong thing?

00:32:10.310 --> 00:32:14.000
And oh, in this situation,
I'm not allowed to do that.

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:17.080
And this is really important
to have that social editor.

00:32:17.080 --> 00:32:21.280
Otherwise, we would all
be leaking out stuff

00:32:21.280 --> 00:32:24.580
the whole time, and acting
out, which is what kids do.

00:32:24.580 --> 00:32:27.400
But it's really sad because
the flip side of that

00:32:27.400 --> 00:32:30.100
is that we lose the
play that we have.

00:32:30.100 --> 00:32:31.750
So anytime that
you feel like you

00:32:31.750 --> 00:32:33.820
want to get more
humor into something,

00:32:33.820 --> 00:32:37.695
just try and access
your kid self.

00:32:37.695 --> 00:32:38.820
MATT BRITTIN: Great answer.

00:32:38.820 --> 00:32:41.165
Do come for other questions.

00:32:41.165 --> 00:32:41.790
Oh, here we go.

00:32:41.790 --> 00:32:43.900
Thank you.

00:32:43.900 --> 00:32:46.200
AUDIENCE: So let's say you
work with a range of clients

00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:49.915
who are high status
to happy high status.

00:32:49.915 --> 00:32:51.290
VIV GROSKOP: Asking
for a friend.

00:32:51.290 --> 00:32:52.640
AUDIENCE: Yeah, maybe.

00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:54.690
And you're not
yet either status,

00:32:54.690 --> 00:32:58.200
but more of an aspiring
happy high status.

00:32:58.200 --> 00:33:03.730
How do you own the room as
that person with high status?

00:33:03.730 --> 00:33:04.980
VIV GROSKOP: Very interesting.

00:33:04.980 --> 00:33:07.890
Specifically
working with-- yeah,

00:33:07.890 --> 00:33:12.165
some people who are difficult
and some people who are fine,

00:33:12.165 --> 00:33:13.290
you're saying.

00:33:13.290 --> 00:33:16.300
AUDIENCE: Like an Anna
Wintour, for example.

00:33:16.300 --> 00:33:17.790
VIV GROSKOP: Oh
what would you do

00:33:17.790 --> 00:33:19.260
if Anna Wintour was your boss?

00:33:19.260 --> 00:33:20.340
Right.

00:33:20.340 --> 00:33:22.360
What a great example.

00:33:22.360 --> 00:33:25.110
So yeah, I mean, Anna
Wintour is somebody

00:33:25.110 --> 00:33:27.600
who is not happy high status.

00:33:27.600 --> 00:33:28.668
She is guarded.

00:33:28.668 --> 00:33:30.710
MATT BRITTIN: Unhappy high
status, would you say?

00:33:30.710 --> 00:33:34.688
VIV GROSKOP: Well, I imagine
in herself, she's very happy.

00:33:34.688 --> 00:33:36.480
She's got things set
up just how she wants.

00:33:36.480 --> 00:33:39.180
But she's kind of
guarded high status.

00:33:39.180 --> 00:33:42.960
The Queen is not
happy high status.

00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:43.950
She can't be.

00:33:43.950 --> 00:33:46.740
She can't have the same
energy as Michelle Obama.

00:33:46.740 --> 00:33:50.160
So for example, Michelle
Obama, when she met the queen,

00:33:50.160 --> 00:33:53.910
she touched her, which
was a breach of protocol.

00:33:53.910 --> 00:33:57.330
But she's so happy high
status, she got away with it.

00:33:57.330 --> 00:33:59.640
The Queen would
not touch anybody

00:33:59.640 --> 00:34:02.548
because she's not in
that kind of happy zone,

00:34:02.548 --> 00:34:03.840
and neither would Anna Wintour.

00:34:03.840 --> 00:34:06.600
She's in that kind
of guarded zone.

00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:09.810
For me, it's really important
to underline that point of it's

00:34:09.810 --> 00:34:11.670
not about the status
that you actually

00:34:11.670 --> 00:34:16.800
occupy, it's about your
energy, and your generosity,

00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:20.040
and your willingness
to accept any opinion

00:34:20.040 --> 00:34:22.500
and work with whoever
you're working with.

00:34:22.500 --> 00:34:25.389
And yeah, it's not a magic wand.

00:34:25.389 --> 00:34:27.659
So sometimes you work
with difficult people,

00:34:27.659 --> 00:34:30.090
and the reality is
they are difficult.

00:34:30.090 --> 00:34:32.610
And it doesn't matter how
happy high status you are.

00:34:32.610 --> 00:34:37.440
Happy high status might help
you be more zen about accepting,

00:34:37.440 --> 00:34:41.550
oh, yeah, this person is quite
tricky, but that's about them,

00:34:41.550 --> 00:34:42.460
it's not about me.

00:34:42.460 --> 00:34:44.113
I'm going to maintain my poise.

00:34:44.113 --> 00:34:45.780
MATT BRITTIN: Just
as you were talking--

00:34:45.780 --> 00:34:47.894
I think there's something about
getting your attention off

00:34:47.894 --> 00:34:49.561
of yourself and not
taking it personally

00:34:49.561 --> 00:34:51.090
if somebody is
[? radiating ?] that.

00:34:51.090 --> 00:34:53.003
And I think what you
said about high status--

00:34:53.003 --> 00:34:54.420
happy high status,
seems to me, is

00:34:54.420 --> 00:34:57.660
about putting people at ease,
and having that sort of grace

00:34:57.660 --> 00:34:58.590
to be able to do that.

00:34:58.590 --> 00:35:00.510
There's something in that
about getting your attention

00:35:00.510 --> 00:35:02.370
off yourself, which
is hard to do when

00:35:02.370 --> 00:35:04.470
there's somebody
that makes you feel

00:35:04.470 --> 00:35:06.030
sort of defensive, or small.

00:35:06.030 --> 00:35:07.480
VIV GROSKOP: Yeah, exactly.

00:35:07.480 --> 00:35:10.740
And that is something that
is very hard-won in comedy.

00:35:10.740 --> 00:35:13.920
Because there can often be
negative energy somewhere

00:35:13.920 --> 00:35:15.060
in the room.

00:35:15.060 --> 00:35:18.390
People are often too
drunk, or there could even

00:35:18.390 --> 00:35:20.580
be violence in
the room, or there

00:35:20.580 --> 00:35:23.550
could be just somebody in
the back of the room that

00:35:23.550 --> 00:35:27.520
doesn't really like you and
is here for someone else.

00:35:27.520 --> 00:35:29.340
And you have to learn to like--

00:35:29.340 --> 00:35:30.390
that's fine.

00:35:30.390 --> 00:35:32.790
Not everybody has to
be here to like me.

00:35:32.790 --> 00:35:33.610
You're a bit drunk.

00:35:33.610 --> 00:35:35.920
Great, let's look after
you, make sure you're OK.

00:35:35.920 --> 00:35:36.760
You want to heckle.

00:35:36.760 --> 00:35:39.010
OK, let's let you
have your moment.

00:35:39.010 --> 00:35:40.800
It's having that
kind of lightness,

00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:43.410
of everything is fine.

00:35:43.410 --> 00:35:44.840
MATT BRITTIN: Thank
you very much.

00:35:44.840 --> 00:35:46.230
One thing you talk
about in the book

00:35:46.230 --> 00:35:48.030
is, there are often
occasions when you're

00:35:48.030 --> 00:35:50.370
asked to be on a stage
or platform when you're

00:35:50.370 --> 00:35:53.520
part of a panel, and you know,
how should you behave when

00:35:53.520 --> 00:35:54.988
you're not the person talking.

00:35:54.988 --> 00:35:57.030
And just before we came
on, we talked about that,

00:35:57.030 --> 00:35:59.238
and said, well, if you want
to know how not to do it,

00:35:59.238 --> 00:36:00.540
look at Alan Partridge.

00:36:00.540 --> 00:36:03.978
And I've been struggling ever
since then with the sort of--

00:36:03.978 --> 00:36:05.850
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:05.850 --> 00:36:06.570
--thing.

00:36:06.570 --> 00:36:07.350
But--

00:36:07.350 --> 00:36:09.506
VIV GROSKOP: That's a
very good impression.

00:36:09.506 --> 00:36:11.589
MATT BRITTIN: I've been
working on it for a while.

00:36:11.589 --> 00:36:13.315
So just tell us a
bit more about that.

00:36:13.315 --> 00:36:14.940
There are a whole
bunch of other things

00:36:14.940 --> 00:36:17.190
to do with being on stage,
where the attention is

00:36:17.190 --> 00:36:18.240
on you, and not on you.

00:36:18.240 --> 00:36:20.407
How do you deal with that
sort of mixture of things?

00:36:20.407 --> 00:36:22.363
You do lots of hosting
panels, for example,

00:36:22.363 --> 00:36:23.530
and that kind of experience.

00:36:23.530 --> 00:36:26.070
VIV GROSKOP: Yeah,
I had to learn this

00:36:26.070 --> 00:36:27.720
over a long period of time.

00:36:27.720 --> 00:36:31.830
Because before I was really
confident doing a lot of stuff

00:36:31.830 --> 00:36:34.158
on my own, I started--

00:36:34.158 --> 00:36:35.700
and this is a good
lesson for anybody

00:36:35.700 --> 00:36:37.290
who wants to do more speaking.

00:36:37.290 --> 00:36:40.680
Volunteer for the kind of--

00:36:40.680 --> 00:36:42.502
I was going to say,
vice president role,

00:36:42.502 --> 00:36:43.460
but that's a bit grand.

00:36:43.460 --> 00:36:46.110
But volunteer to be the
moderator, volunteer

00:36:46.110 --> 00:36:48.330
to be the person
like Hannah did,

00:36:48.330 --> 00:36:50.490
being the person introducing.

00:36:50.490 --> 00:36:54.180
Volunteer to be part of
it, but not the keynote.

00:36:54.180 --> 00:36:56.400
And so then you have
to learn, sometimes,

00:36:56.400 --> 00:37:00.600
how to be on stage when
the attention isn't on you.

00:37:00.600 --> 00:37:03.060
And as you say, there
is a tendency sometimes,

00:37:03.060 --> 00:37:05.340
if you're on a panel or
you're an interviewer

00:37:05.340 --> 00:37:11.469
and somebody is giving a very
long answer, to be like--

00:37:11.469 --> 00:37:13.710
[CHUCKLING]

00:37:13.710 --> 00:37:18.800
--to almost sort of overly show
how self-conscious you are.

00:37:18.800 --> 00:37:23.510
So you have to learn how to
have an active listening role.

00:37:23.510 --> 00:37:25.670
And it's annoying, I
don't have a pen with me,

00:37:25.670 --> 00:37:27.570
but I would-- do you have a pen?

00:37:27.570 --> 00:37:28.220
Great.

00:37:28.220 --> 00:37:32.150
So what I would often do
is have pointless pen.

00:37:32.150 --> 00:37:34.790
Pointless pen is very
useful for that role--

00:37:34.790 --> 00:37:36.510
also in meetings.

00:37:36.510 --> 00:37:40.890
So it's going to avoid
you doing this or--

00:37:40.890 --> 00:37:43.460
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:43.460 --> 00:37:44.840
We've all done that.

00:37:44.840 --> 00:37:46.940
So If you have
pointless pen, you're

00:37:46.940 --> 00:37:51.320
disciplined to hold it,
and be still, and just

00:37:51.320 --> 00:37:53.360
be actively listening.

00:37:53.360 --> 00:37:56.630
And that's useful, I think,
in meetings as well as

00:37:56.630 --> 00:37:58.580
in a public situation.

00:37:58.580 --> 00:38:00.290
Actually, an awards thing--

00:38:00.290 --> 00:38:03.470
I have to do awards things
where there could be 27 awards.

00:38:03.470 --> 00:38:05.960
And there's loads of stuff
going on the stage and people

00:38:05.960 --> 00:38:09.950
having their photos taken, and
I have to stand there and not

00:38:09.950 --> 00:38:11.000
be like--

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:14.300
I can't check my
phone or look bored.

00:38:14.300 --> 00:38:16.310
And this could go
on over three hours.

00:38:16.310 --> 00:38:17.640
I have to be engaged.

00:38:17.640 --> 00:38:18.880
So I point this pen.

00:38:18.880 --> 00:38:19.120
MATT BRITTIN: Props.

00:38:19.120 --> 00:38:20.320
VIV GROSKOP: It's
my secret weapon.

00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:21.920
MATT BRITTIN: Props are
always good, absolutely.

00:38:21.920 --> 00:38:23.337
VIV GROSKOP: But
the other thing I

00:38:23.337 --> 00:38:25.220
want to say in relation
to that is, sometimes

00:38:25.220 --> 00:38:28.130
it doesn't matter that you
don't have anything to say.

00:38:28.130 --> 00:38:31.760
And that's really important
on a panel, as a moderator,

00:38:31.760 --> 00:38:32.940
in meetings.

00:38:32.940 --> 00:38:35.480
It doesn't always have
to be your turn to talk.

00:38:35.480 --> 00:38:38.313
Sometimes it can be your turn
to listen, to facilitate others.

00:38:38.313 --> 00:38:40.730
MATT BRITTIN: Yes, I think the
audience is always grateful

00:38:40.730 --> 00:38:42.355
when I just pass on
to the next person.

00:38:42.355 --> 00:38:43.440
It's always good.

00:38:43.440 --> 00:38:44.400
But actually, no,
that's true, isn't it?

00:38:44.400 --> 00:38:45.830
When you're in the audience,
you don't necessarily

00:38:45.830 --> 00:38:47.030
want everyone on
the panel to say,

00:38:47.030 --> 00:38:48.260
yes, let me just build on that.

00:38:48.260 --> 00:38:48.740
VIV GROSKOP: Exactly.

00:38:48.740 --> 00:38:49.370
MATT BRITTIN: It's
really annoying.

00:38:49.370 --> 00:38:50.245
VIV GROSKOP: Exactly.

00:38:50.245 --> 00:38:53.210
And on panels, what I love
is where the panelists talk

00:38:53.210 --> 00:38:55.950
to each other, and
the moderator says,

00:38:55.950 --> 00:39:00.680
in advance, please don't use me
as your safety net and as your,

00:39:00.680 --> 00:39:02.390
like, oh, I'd like
to speak next,

00:39:02.390 --> 00:39:04.120
but speak across each other.

00:39:04.120 --> 00:39:06.600
MATT BRITTIN: Yeah,
absolutely. [? Tess. ?]

00:39:06.600 --> 00:39:07.940
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:39:07.940 --> 00:39:09.360
My question is
actually connected

00:39:09.360 --> 00:39:10.610
to what you're discussing now.

00:39:10.610 --> 00:39:12.027
I think, often,
at Google, we have

00:39:12.027 --> 00:39:14.450
to go out in groups
or pairs, and we

00:39:14.450 --> 00:39:16.670
might go to client events,
or various situations

00:39:16.670 --> 00:39:19.103
where you can't
all own the room.

00:39:19.103 --> 00:39:21.020
And sometimes it's obvious
who that leader is,

00:39:21.020 --> 00:39:24.590
and you might know it's my
turn to be low-presence.

00:39:24.590 --> 00:39:26.240
I guess my question
is around how

00:39:26.240 --> 00:39:28.420
do you recommend
dealing with that,

00:39:28.420 --> 00:39:30.920
either having that conversation
beforehand or even if you're

00:39:30.920 --> 00:39:33.170
in a low-presence role.

00:39:33.170 --> 00:39:36.530
How do you still own that moment
without taking the limelight

00:39:36.530 --> 00:39:39.590
from either one of your
colleagues or a client?

00:39:39.590 --> 00:39:41.030
VIV GROSKOP: Yeah,
for me, that's

00:39:41.030 --> 00:39:43.850
a happy high status question.

00:39:43.850 --> 00:39:48.440
And of course you need to have
a clear conversation, I think,

00:39:48.440 --> 00:39:52.450
as you would at any
performance event or--

00:39:52.450 --> 00:39:55.310
who's going on first, how are
we going on together, who's

00:39:55.310 --> 00:39:56.840
going to be introducing her--

00:39:56.840 --> 00:40:00.500
setting the parameters
and the expectations

00:40:00.500 --> 00:40:03.260
and the signposting is
not only good for you,

00:40:03.260 --> 00:40:05.850
but good for whoever you're
going to see, of like, oh yeah,

00:40:05.850 --> 00:40:07.880
this is the person
who's taking the lead.

00:40:07.880 --> 00:40:10.100
And you don't have to
say those things when

00:40:10.100 --> 00:40:11.725
you get into a meeting,
but you'll just

00:40:11.725 --> 00:40:13.230
show it in your body language.

00:40:13.230 --> 00:40:17.030
So being open and upfront
in agreeing those things.

00:40:17.030 --> 00:40:22.677
But also, the thing I learned
is it's not about you.

00:40:22.677 --> 00:40:25.010
It's not about you, and it
doesn't have to be about you.

00:40:25.010 --> 00:40:27.470
And I had to learn
that when I was doing--

00:40:27.470 --> 00:40:30.640
sometimes when I was early on,
doing things like Graham Norton

00:40:30.640 --> 00:40:33.470
book tour or Dawn French
book tour and stuff,

00:40:33.470 --> 00:40:37.550
I would be really, really
nervous going on, and thinking,

00:40:37.550 --> 00:40:39.710
people need to know about me.

00:40:39.710 --> 00:40:41.030
This is a big audience.

00:40:41.030 --> 00:40:43.220
They should know about
me, and they should

00:40:43.220 --> 00:40:44.490
know that I'm a comedian.

00:40:44.490 --> 00:40:46.970
And oh my God, what if some
of them think I'm not funny?

00:40:46.970 --> 00:40:51.230
And I had to remind myself,
Viv, this is not about you.

00:40:51.230 --> 00:40:53.780
You are just there to be a
safety net for that person,

00:40:53.780 --> 00:40:55.885
to be the fall guy
if they need you.

00:40:55.885 --> 00:40:58.010
You've got to find your
other space, your own space

00:40:58.010 --> 00:40:59.360
to shine in.

00:40:59.360 --> 00:41:03.530
So knowing when it's your
moment and living up to it,

00:41:03.530 --> 00:41:07.490
and knowing when it isn't,
is really important.

00:41:07.490 --> 00:41:08.600
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:41:08.600 --> 00:41:10.558
MATT BRITTIN: Actually,
can I just add to that.

00:41:10.558 --> 00:41:12.920
Because one thing I think
really helps is preparation.

00:41:12.920 --> 00:41:14.240
So whether it's a
meeting or whatever, kind

00:41:14.240 --> 00:41:15.740
of once you're
really well prepared,

00:41:15.740 --> 00:41:18.295
then you can pay attention to
what's going on in the room.

00:41:18.295 --> 00:41:20.330
So something like this,
I actually prepare a lot

00:41:20.330 --> 00:41:21.750
for this kind of thing.

00:41:21.750 --> 00:41:23.110
So I've read your book, I've
listened to you podcasts,

00:41:23.110 --> 00:41:24.660
I know what I'm interested in.

00:41:24.660 --> 00:41:26.210
And then I can not
worry about what's

00:41:26.210 --> 00:41:27.680
the next question,
because I can just listen,

00:41:27.680 --> 00:41:29.138
and that sounds
really interesting.

00:41:29.138 --> 00:41:32.168
I think the same, I find,
applies in those meetings.

00:41:32.168 --> 00:41:33.710
You know the stuff,
and therefore you

00:41:33.710 --> 00:41:35.480
can relax and pay
attention to what's

00:41:35.480 --> 00:41:36.640
happening in front of you.

00:41:36.640 --> 00:41:38.810
And sometimes we're so
caught up in our own heads

00:41:38.810 --> 00:41:39.830
that we can't do that.

00:41:39.830 --> 00:41:41.703
I get that a lot.

00:41:41.703 --> 00:41:43.870
I've just realized I've now
taken the limelight when

00:41:43.870 --> 00:41:45.187
it should be yours.

00:41:45.187 --> 00:41:46.020
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:41:46.020 --> 00:41:48.062
Thank you so much for
coming to speak to us, Viv.

00:41:48.062 --> 00:41:49.340
I've enjoyed this so much.

00:41:49.340 --> 00:41:51.270
I promise I'll try
the power poses.

00:41:51.270 --> 00:41:53.240
But my question
was, do you think

00:41:53.240 --> 00:41:54.890
that the rules for
owning the room

00:41:54.890 --> 00:41:56.652
differ for women and for men?

00:41:56.652 --> 00:41:57.360
VIV GROSKOP: Yes.

00:41:57.360 --> 00:42:00.260
Well, this is the elephant
in the room, this question,

00:42:00.260 --> 00:42:03.390
isn't it, is it different
for women and for men?

00:42:03.390 --> 00:42:05.480
So the book is called
"How to Own the Room--

00:42:05.480 --> 00:42:08.000
Women and the Art of
Brilliant Speaking."

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:10.430
And there doesn't
need to be a book

00:42:10.430 --> 00:42:11.730
called "How to Own the Room--

00:42:11.730 --> 00:42:13.740
Men and the Art of
Brilliant Speaking."

00:42:13.740 --> 00:42:15.560
It would not get published.

00:42:15.560 --> 00:42:19.100
The reason I wanted to write it,
and I wrote it in the way that

00:42:19.100 --> 00:42:23.180
I did-- which is by a woman,
for women, about women--

00:42:23.180 --> 00:42:27.620
was that all of the other
material on this subject

00:42:27.620 --> 00:42:30.320
was by men, for men, about men.

00:42:30.320 --> 00:42:35.600
So you go back 10, 20
years, and the only examples

00:42:35.600 --> 00:42:38.720
are Martin Luther King,
Winston Churchill.

00:42:38.720 --> 00:42:42.260
They're all very classic,
and they're all very

00:42:42.260 --> 00:42:44.120
masculine examples.

00:42:44.120 --> 00:42:47.060
And I wanted to do something
that reflects the last 20

00:42:47.060 --> 00:42:50.000
years, when we've had this
huge turnaround, largely

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:52.700
due to digital media.

00:42:52.700 --> 00:42:55.220
Without digital media,
who would have ever seen

00:42:55.220 --> 00:42:59.060
Michelle Obama speaking at
the Democratic conventions?

00:42:59.060 --> 00:43:03.470
Even television hasn't had
as big an impact as YouTube,

00:43:03.470 --> 00:43:06.650
TED Talks, Facebook
Live, all of these things

00:43:06.650 --> 00:43:10.730
that give us immediate
access to women speaking.

00:43:10.730 --> 00:43:13.473
In terms of whether
audiences respond differently

00:43:13.473 --> 00:43:15.140
to men and women, I
think there is still

00:43:15.140 --> 00:43:17.850
something going on there, but
we don't really know what it is.

00:43:17.850 --> 00:43:20.680
And it's something that is
deep within our culture.

00:43:20.680 --> 00:43:22.920
Because I'm not sure
it's so bad now,

00:43:22.920 --> 00:43:25.212
but when I started
out as a stand-up,

00:43:25.212 --> 00:43:27.170
I would feel the energy
change in the room, of,

00:43:27.170 --> 00:43:30.350
oh, it's a woman,
that's a shame.

00:43:33.350 --> 00:43:35.210
And that's the truth.

00:43:35.210 --> 00:43:37.760
Because a lot-- even women.

00:43:37.760 --> 00:43:40.700
And women will often-- all women
stand-ups complain about this.

00:43:40.700 --> 00:43:43.510
Women come up to you at
the end and say, oh, I

00:43:43.510 --> 00:43:45.410
didn't expect you to be funny.

00:43:45.410 --> 00:43:47.450
I don't like women comedians--

00:43:47.450 --> 00:43:49.190
women saying this.

00:43:49.190 --> 00:43:53.240
So there's a lot of cultural
baggage in this stuff that's

00:43:53.240 --> 00:43:56.180
difficult for us to talk
about and difficult to know

00:43:56.180 --> 00:43:58.290
why we feel this way.

00:43:58.290 --> 00:44:00.890
And for me, it's more important
just to let go of all that,

00:44:00.890 --> 00:44:04.970
and just let it be, and
do whatever you want to do

00:44:04.970 --> 00:44:07.480
to try and break through it.

00:44:07.480 --> 00:44:08.680
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:44:08.680 --> 00:44:10.220
MATT BRITTIN: I would recommend
the book, though, for men,

00:44:10.220 --> 00:44:12.290
because pretty much
everything in there

00:44:12.290 --> 00:44:15.650
is also really, really
helpful for anyone

00:44:15.650 --> 00:44:17.620
doing public speaking, I'd say.

00:44:17.620 --> 00:44:20.600
VIV GROSKOP: Yeah, and lots
of men who've read it and are

00:44:20.600 --> 00:44:23.700
into the podcast, which
only features women--

00:44:23.700 --> 00:44:27.400
although I'm thinking of
having a token male series,

00:44:27.400 --> 00:44:29.120
maybe not--

00:44:29.120 --> 00:44:33.690
they will say that this is
really not about gender,

00:44:33.690 --> 00:44:36.680
it's about trying
to do something

00:44:36.680 --> 00:44:40.400
to counter the
phenomenon of the alphas.

00:44:40.400 --> 00:44:43.280
So the alpha person who always--

00:44:43.280 --> 00:44:47.340
and again, it doesn't have to
be the most high-status person.

00:44:47.340 --> 00:44:50.840
It could be a low-status
person who's just really noisy

00:44:50.840 --> 00:44:52.970
and takes up all the
energy in the room.

00:44:52.970 --> 00:44:55.160
And men feel that
as much as women.

00:44:55.160 --> 00:44:59.270
And it's wanting to find a way
to find your voice so that you

00:44:59.270 --> 00:45:02.540
get heard, and it's not just
the most charismatic, the most

00:45:02.540 --> 00:45:03.630
dynamic.

00:45:03.630 --> 00:45:04.890
Do you know what I mean?

00:45:04.890 --> 00:45:06.590
And there's loads
of other prejudices

00:45:06.590 --> 00:45:09.470
around this area as
well, like class, accent,

00:45:09.470 --> 00:45:10.790
how good-looking you are.

00:45:10.790 --> 00:45:12.980
The more good-looking
you are, the more people

00:45:12.980 --> 00:45:14.630
are going to listen to you.

00:45:14.630 --> 00:45:17.930
That's a prejudice that's
deep within us as well.

00:45:17.930 --> 00:45:20.450
So it's trying to break
through all of these things

00:45:20.450 --> 00:45:22.840
and finding a way to
be OK with yourself.

00:45:22.840 --> 00:45:24.300
MATT BRITTIN: Thank you.

00:45:24.300 --> 00:45:25.130
AUDIENCE: Great.

00:45:25.130 --> 00:45:25.980
Thank you so much.

00:45:25.980 --> 00:45:29.048
This was really hilarious,
and amazing to hear you speak.

00:45:29.048 --> 00:45:30.590
I was wondering--
my question is kind

00:45:30.590 --> 00:45:32.600
of similar to the whole
female-male dynamic,

00:45:32.600 --> 00:45:33.952
but more seniority level.

00:45:33.952 --> 00:45:35.660
So something, for
example, that I noticed

00:45:35.660 --> 00:45:38.330
in my team is our-- my boss's
boss, who is a director,

00:45:38.330 --> 00:45:39.615
is very funny, right?

00:45:39.615 --> 00:45:41.240
And he'll open up a
meeting, and always

00:45:41.240 --> 00:45:43.790
kind of do something funny
to kind of lighten the load

00:45:43.790 --> 00:45:45.640
and to make it a little bit--

00:45:45.640 --> 00:45:47.150
to make it easy-going.

00:45:47.150 --> 00:45:49.220
However, when
you're more junior,

00:45:49.220 --> 00:45:50.760
it's actually tricky to do that.

00:45:50.760 --> 00:45:52.968
Sometimes you can do that
and fall flat on your face.

00:45:52.968 --> 00:45:55.340
So kind of knowing where
your place is in a meeting,

00:45:55.340 --> 00:45:57.230
or kind of what you
talked about earlier,

00:45:57.230 --> 00:45:59.930
I was wondering if there's
any kind of guidance you have

00:45:59.930 --> 00:46:02.510
around how much power you have.

00:46:02.510 --> 00:46:04.320
Like it's easy for
Matt to be hilarious.

00:46:04.320 --> 00:46:06.565
He's like the person
in EMEA, right?

00:46:06.565 --> 00:46:07.190
But if you're--

00:46:07.190 --> 00:46:07.750
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:07.750 --> 00:46:08.540
MATT BRITTIN: (FEIGNING
SEVERITY) Laugh or you're

00:46:08.540 --> 00:46:10.050
fired.

00:46:10.050 --> 00:46:11.610
AUDIENCE: But you
know, you can be.

00:46:11.610 --> 00:46:12.860
You could just be like, voila.

00:46:12.860 --> 00:46:13.280
VIV GROSKOP: He's
the person in what?

00:46:13.280 --> 00:46:13.838
In EMEA?

00:46:13.838 --> 00:46:14.880
MATT BRITTIN: The region.

00:46:14.880 --> 00:46:15.600
AUDIENCE: But you
know what I mean.

00:46:15.600 --> 00:46:16.460
So how do you--

00:46:16.460 --> 00:46:17.220
VIV GROSKOP: Oh, the region.

00:46:17.220 --> 00:46:18.230
AUDIENCE: Do you have
any experience with that?

00:46:18.230 --> 00:46:20.605
Have you seen people that are
more junior kind of pull it

00:46:20.605 --> 00:46:21.843
off, and to what degree?

00:46:21.843 --> 00:46:24.260
And I don't know, just what
are your thoughts around this?

00:46:24.260 --> 00:46:25.300
I know it's a little bit of a--

00:46:25.300 --> 00:46:25.870
you know.

00:46:25.870 --> 00:46:28.530
VIV GROSKOP: No, it's a
really great question,

00:46:28.530 --> 00:46:30.740
and it's one that
comes up quite a lot.

00:46:30.740 --> 00:46:35.330
I do some work with
senior women in much

00:46:35.330 --> 00:46:37.790
more formal
organizations than this,

00:46:37.790 --> 00:46:42.050
where they are
preparing a big keynote,

00:46:42.050 --> 00:46:46.100
and they know there's
a lot resting on it,

00:46:46.100 --> 00:46:48.995
and they'd like to find
a moment of lightness

00:46:48.995 --> 00:46:50.720
or to make a joke
at the beginning,

00:46:50.720 --> 00:46:53.550
and they don't know if
they can get away with it.

00:46:53.550 --> 00:46:56.630
And a lot of it is
to do with risk.

00:46:56.630 --> 00:47:00.230
And you have to become really
expert at risk assessment,

00:47:00.230 --> 00:47:02.600
and you have to
choose your battles.

00:47:02.600 --> 00:47:06.710
So I think it's very
personalized to each situation

00:47:06.710 --> 00:47:12.760
as to how high a risk that would
be to try that joke and let it

00:47:12.760 --> 00:47:14.170
fall flat on your face.

00:47:14.170 --> 00:47:18.880
To try a joke or make a
comment, and for it to bomb

00:47:18.880 --> 00:47:21.430
can actually be a very
high status thing.

00:47:21.430 --> 00:47:24.190
Because you can
bounce back from it,

00:47:24.190 --> 00:47:25.960
and other people in
the room are very

00:47:25.960 --> 00:47:27.910
inspired when that happens.

00:47:27.910 --> 00:47:30.490
I was telling Matt
earlier about,

00:47:30.490 --> 00:47:34.570
earlier this week, I was
doing a publishing event

00:47:34.570 --> 00:47:38.177
with eight authors where I was
hosting everybody-- getting

00:47:38.177 --> 00:47:39.760
through it all,
interviewing them all,

00:47:39.760 --> 00:47:41.530
begging up their books.

00:47:41.530 --> 00:47:45.580
And the headline act was
going to be Bill Bryson,

00:47:45.580 --> 00:47:50.200
the multi-award-winning,
multi-massive-big-selling

00:47:50.200 --> 00:47:51.970
travel writer.

00:47:51.970 --> 00:47:54.850
And he hadn't turned up.

00:47:54.850 --> 00:47:56.590
And he wasn't going to come.

00:47:56.590 --> 00:47:57.570
He canceled.

00:47:57.570 --> 00:48:01.400
He genuinely couldn't
physically get there in the end.

00:48:01.400 --> 00:48:04.600
And they didn't
want me to say this

00:48:04.600 --> 00:48:06.350
until the end of the event.

00:48:06.350 --> 00:48:08.680
So I had this kind of
weighing on me throughout,

00:48:08.680 --> 00:48:11.200
of like, at the end, I've
got to manage this energy.

00:48:11.200 --> 00:48:13.390
And so I was quite
stressed, and nervous,

00:48:13.390 --> 00:48:15.350
and trying to camouflage that.

00:48:15.350 --> 00:48:18.970
And then as I came to interview
one of the last authors,

00:48:18.970 --> 00:48:21.460
the notes that I had
about her said that she'd

00:48:21.460 --> 00:48:23.650
written a contemporary debut.

00:48:23.650 --> 00:48:26.330
So I announced this, there's
this contemporary debut,

00:48:26.330 --> 00:48:28.720
how exciting, let's
speak to the author.

00:48:28.720 --> 00:48:31.870
And she sat down and I
said, congratulations

00:48:31.870 --> 00:48:33.680
on your first book.

00:48:33.680 --> 00:48:38.910
And she said, it's not my
first book, it's my third book.

00:48:38.910 --> 00:48:42.660
And how I bounced back
from that in that moment--

00:48:42.660 --> 00:48:45.300
and I immediately was
like, oh, this is-- oh, no.

00:48:45.300 --> 00:48:48.930
I felt terrible for her
because I'd insulted her.

00:48:48.930 --> 00:48:52.760
I felt terrible for me because
I looked really stupid.

00:48:52.760 --> 00:48:55.333
And I felt bad, because I
knew that, after this, there

00:48:55.333 --> 00:48:57.750
was going to come a moment
where I had to say, yeah, also,

00:48:57.750 --> 00:48:59.910
by the way, guys, Bill
Bryson's not here.

00:48:59.910 --> 00:49:05.080
So in that split-second,
I had to recover and say,

00:49:05.080 --> 00:49:08.250
oh, I'm so sorry, but this
is a contemporary debut,

00:49:08.250 --> 00:49:10.440
so your previous books
must be historical.

00:49:10.440 --> 00:49:13.020
Tell us why you moved
into contemporary

00:49:13.020 --> 00:49:14.340
rather than historical.

00:49:14.340 --> 00:49:17.400
So quickly find something
to acknowledge my error,

00:49:17.400 --> 00:49:19.920
say sorry, move on.

00:49:19.920 --> 00:49:21.780
And afterwards,
everyone in the room--

00:49:21.780 --> 00:49:24.330
it was the publisher
who published this book,

00:49:24.330 --> 00:49:27.000
so everyone in the
room had worked on--

00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:29.185
everyone who'd worked on
the book was in the room.

00:49:29.185 --> 00:49:31.810
The guy who bought the book was
in the room, all of this stuff,

00:49:31.810 --> 00:49:33.300
all of my colleagues.

00:49:33.300 --> 00:49:35.550
And they all know
that I'm supposed

00:49:35.550 --> 00:49:38.430
to be the expert on how to
own the room and all of this.

00:49:38.430 --> 00:49:42.900
And they said, oh, we loved
watching you screw up.

00:49:42.900 --> 00:49:44.350
We loved it.

00:49:44.350 --> 00:49:48.210
And to me, that was a great
moment and a great lesson.

00:49:48.210 --> 00:49:51.120
Because it's good
to get things wrong.

00:49:51.120 --> 00:49:52.980
It's good to have
a joke fall flat.

00:49:52.980 --> 00:49:55.933
It's good to say the
wrong thing sometimes.

00:49:55.933 --> 00:49:56.850
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:49:56.850 --> 00:49:57.900
VIV GROSKOP: I
mean, these things

00:49:57.900 --> 00:50:00.460
are kind of easy for me to
say because I'm an outsider,

00:50:00.460 --> 00:50:02.730
I'm external, I do
not work in a company.

00:50:02.730 --> 00:50:06.120
And you need to also recognize
the limits of these things,

00:50:06.120 --> 00:50:08.320
and temper your expectations.

00:50:08.320 --> 00:50:11.110
Because you can't say the
same thing in a comedy club

00:50:11.110 --> 00:50:13.410
that you can say in
this environment,

00:50:13.410 --> 00:50:17.010
or at your Q4 marketing report.

00:50:17.010 --> 00:50:19.290
So you've got to adjust it.

00:50:19.290 --> 00:50:26.460
So you're not going to go into
the meeting and be Joan Rivers.

00:50:26.460 --> 00:50:28.150
But yeah, risk-- take risk.

00:50:28.150 --> 00:50:28.650
Why not?

00:50:28.650 --> 00:50:29.483
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:50:29.483 --> 00:50:30.940
That was really-- thank you.

00:50:30.940 --> 00:50:33.198
MATT BRITTIN: Huge
thanks to Viv Groskop.

00:50:33.198 --> 00:50:34.740
Thank you very much,
Viv, for coming.

00:50:34.740 --> 00:50:38.390
[APPLAUSE]
