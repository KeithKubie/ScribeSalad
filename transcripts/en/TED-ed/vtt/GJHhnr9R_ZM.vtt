00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:11.795
What if electricity could travel forever
without being diminished?

00:00:11.795 --> 00:00:16.708
What if a computer could run exponentially
faster with perfect accuracy?

00:00:16.708 --> 00:00:20.821
What technology could 
those abilities build?

00:00:20.821 --> 00:00:24.401
We may be able to find out thanks 
to the work of the three scientists

00:00:24.401 --> 00:00:28.993
who won the Nobel Prize 
in Physics in 2016.

00:00:28.993 --> 00:00:29.981
David Thouless,

00:00:29.981 --> 00:00:31.022
Duncan Haldane,

00:00:31.022 --> 00:00:34.210
and Michael Kosterlitz won the award
for discovering

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:37.594
that even microscopic matter
at the smallest scale

00:00:37.594 --> 00:00:42.842
can exhibit macroscopic properties
and phases that are topological.

00:00:42.842 --> 00:00:46.132
But what does that mean?

00:00:46.132 --> 00:00:48.912
First of all, topology is a branch
of mathematics

00:00:48.912 --> 00:00:53.093
that focuses on fundamental properties
of objects.

00:00:53.093 --> 00:00:58.812
Topological properties don't change when
an object is gradually stretched or bent.

00:00:58.812 --> 00:01:03.003
The object has to be torn or attached
in new places.

00:01:03.003 --> 00:01:06.973
A donut and a coffee cup look the same
to a topologist

00:01:06.973 --> 00:01:09.860
because they both have one hole.

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.323
You could reshape a donut 
into a coffee cup

00:01:12.323 --> 00:01:14.672
and it would still have just one.

00:01:14.672 --> 00:01:18.134
That topological property is stable.

00:01:18.134 --> 00:01:21.344
On the other hand, 
a pretzel has three holes.

00:01:21.344 --> 00:01:25.844
There are no smooth incremental changes
that will turn a donut into a pretzel.

00:01:25.844 --> 00:01:29.875
You'd have to tear two new holes.

00:01:29.875 --> 00:01:33.665
For a long time, it wasn't clear
whether topology was useful

00:01:33.665 --> 00:01:37.164
for describing the behaviors
of subatomic particles.

00:01:37.164 --> 00:01:40.424
That's because particles,
like electrons and photons,

00:01:40.424 --> 00:01:44.225
are subject to the strange laws
of quantum physics,

00:01:44.225 --> 00:01:46.512
which involve a great deal of uncertainty

00:01:46.512 --> 00:01:51.392
that we don't see 
at the scale of coffee cups.

00:01:51.392 --> 00:01:54.733
But the Nobel Laureates discovered
that topological properties

00:01:54.733 --> 00:01:57.722
do exist at the quantum level.

00:01:57.722 --> 00:02:00.993
And that discovery may revolutionize
materials science,

00:02:00.993 --> 00:02:02.723
electronic engineering,

00:02:02.723 --> 00:02:05.073
and computer science.

00:02:05.073 --> 00:02:08.372
That's because these properties
lend surprising stability

00:02:08.372 --> 00:02:12.694
and remarkable characteristics
to some exotic phases of matter

00:02:12.694 --> 00:02:16.903
in the delicate quantum world.

00:02:16.903 --> 00:02:20.033
One example is called 
a topological insulator.

00:02:20.033 --> 00:02:22.365
Imagine a film of electrons.

00:02:22.365 --> 00:02:25.244
If a strong enough magnetic field
passes through them,

00:02:25.244 --> 00:02:28.695
each electron will start traveling
in a circle,

00:02:28.695 --> 00:02:31.316
which is called
a closed orbit.

00:02:31.316 --> 00:02:33.905
Because the electrons are stuck
in these loops,

00:02:33.905 --> 00:02:36.753
they're not conducting electricity.

00:02:36.753 --> 00:02:38.303
But at the edge of the material,

00:02:38.303 --> 00:02:43.765
the orbits become open, connected,
and they all point in the same direction.

00:02:43.765 --> 00:02:47.285
So electrons can jump
from one orbit to the next

00:02:47.285 --> 00:02:50.735
and travel all the way around the edge.

00:02:50.735 --> 00:02:54.265
This means that the material
conducts electricity around the edge

00:02:54.265 --> 00:02:56.186
but not in the middle.

00:02:56.186 --> 00:02:58.465
Here's where topology comes in.

00:02:58.465 --> 00:03:02.814
This conductivity isn't affected
by small changes in the material,

00:03:02.814 --> 00:03:05.775
like impurities or imperfections.

00:03:05.775 --> 00:03:08.345
That's just like how the hole
in the coffee cup

00:03:08.345 --> 00:03:11.615
isn't changed by stretching it out.

00:03:11.615 --> 00:03:16.335
The edge of such a topological insulator
has perfect electron transport:

00:03:16.335 --> 00:03:18.366
no electrons travel backward,

00:03:18.366 --> 00:03:20.635
no energy is lost as heat,

00:03:20.635 --> 00:03:25.273
and the number of conducting pathways
can even be controlled.

00:03:25.273 --> 00:03:27.864
The electronics of the future 
could be built

00:03:27.864 --> 00:03:33.015
to use this perfectly efficient
electron highway.

00:03:33.015 --> 00:03:35.896
The topological properties 
of subatomic particles

00:03:35.896 --> 00:03:39.676
could also transform quantum computing.

00:03:39.676 --> 00:03:41.697
Quantum computers 
take advantage of the fact

00:03:41.697 --> 00:03:46.396
that subatomic particles can be 
in different states at the same time

00:03:46.396 --> 00:03:50.108
to store information in something
called qubits.

00:03:50.108 --> 00:03:53.257
These qubits can solve problems
exponentially faster

00:03:53.257 --> 00:03:56.487
than classical digital computers.

00:03:56.487 --> 00:03:59.027
The problem is that this data
is so delicate

00:03:59.027 --> 00:04:02.523
that interaction with the environment
can destroy it.

00:04:02.523 --> 00:04:05.285
But in some exotic topological phases,

00:04:05.285 --> 00:04:08.733
the subatomic particles 
can become protected.

00:04:08.733 --> 00:04:11.013
In other words, the qubits formed by them

00:04:11.013 --> 00:04:14.762
can't be changed by small 
or local disturbances.

00:04:14.762 --> 00:04:18.378
These topological qubits 
would be more stable,

00:04:18.378 --> 00:04:23.447
leading to more accurate computation
and a better quantum computer.

00:04:23.447 --> 00:04:29.547
Topology was originally studied as
a branch of purely abstract mathematics.

00:04:29.547 --> 00:04:34.068
Thanks to the pioneering work
of Thouless, Haldane, and Kosterlitz,

00:04:34.068 --> 00:04:37.908
we now know it can be used to understand
the riddles of nature

00:04:37.908 --> 00:04:41.178
and to revolutionize 
the future of technologies.
