cases there is an element of truth about

cases there is an element of truth about
 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.349
cases there is an element of truth about
any whistleblowing allegation it may not

any whistleblowing allegation it may not

something that is a problem perhaps not
exactly the problem indicated and that

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399
exactly the problem indicated and that
 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.360
exactly the problem indicated and that
in itself paradoxically is valuable to

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370

an organization I mean what we know from
 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.709
an organization I mean what we know from
history is that in quite a lot of cases

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719
history is that in quite a lot of cases
 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.799
history is that in quite a lot of cases
people blew the whistle nobody paid any

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809
people blew the whistle nobody paid any
 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.779
people blew the whistle nobody paid any
attention it would have been a lot

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789
attention it would have been a lot
 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.459
attention it would have been a lot
better if the whistle blow have been

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469
better if the whistle blow have been
 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:52.970
better if the whistle blow have been
listened to

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980
listened to
 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.619
listened to
that doesn't mean say all whistleblowers

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629
that doesn't mean say all whistleblowers
 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.350
that doesn't mean say all whistleblowers
are right but this is a serious issue

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360
are right but this is a serious issue
 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.010
are right but this is a serious issue
actually scandals coming to the open may

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020
actually scandals coming to the open may
 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.189
actually scandals coming to the open may
be a very healthy sign because in my

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199
be a very healthy sign because in my
 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.640
be a very healthy sign because in my
experience twenty thirty years ago a lot

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650
experience twenty thirty years ago a lot
 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.250
experience twenty thirty years ago a lot
happened that was never reported never

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260
happened that was never reported never
 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.440
happened that was never reported never
discussed and it certainly wasn't

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450
discussed and it certainly wasn't
 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.140
discussed and it certainly wasn't
ethical these kinds of practices today

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150
ethical these kinds of practices today
 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.450
ethical these kinds of practices today
are much more likely to come out in the

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460
are much more likely to come out in the
 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.240
are much more likely to come out in the
open so in that respect therefore I'm

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250
open so in that respect therefore I'm
 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.070
open so in that respect therefore I'm
rather an optimist in terms of the

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080
rather an optimist in terms of the
 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.830
rather an optimist in terms of the
general trend will they always be

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840
general trend will they always be
 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.230
general trend will they always be
ethical issues I think the will the

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240
ethical issues I think the will the
 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.200
ethical issues I think the will the
borderline in terms of what is ethical

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210
borderline in terms of what is ethical
 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.980
borderline in terms of what is ethical
and not ethical shifts all the time and

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:32.990
and not ethical shifts all the time and
 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:35.690
and not ethical shifts all the time and
we're not all the same as people we are

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700
we're not all the same as people we are
 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.120
we're not all the same as people we are
very different across countries across

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130
very different across countries across
 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.999
very different across countries across
cities across continents it's

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009
cities across continents it's
 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.770
cities across continents it's
unreasonable to believe that everybody

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780
unreasonable to believe that everybody
 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.859
unreasonable to believe that everybody
will behave in the same way I believe

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869
will behave in the same way I believe
 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.200
will behave in the same way I believe
that actually there are more checks and

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210
that actually there are more checks and
 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.690
that actually there are more checks and
balances now in terms of ethical

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700
balances now in terms of ethical
 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.990
balances now in terms of ethical
behavior than the were before if you go

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000
behavior than the were before if you go
 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.219
behavior than the were before if you go
back 30 40 50 years ago the environment

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229
back 30 40 50 years ago the environment
 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.100
back 30 40 50 years ago the environment
why was one in which people kept very

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110
why was one in which people kept very
 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.889
why was one in which people kept very
quiet about most things you didn't

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899
quiet about most things you didn't
 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.200
quiet about most things you didn't
discuss them people things were carved

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210
discuss them people things were carved
 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.540
discuss them people things were carved
up quietly behind the scenes in a way

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550
up quietly behind the scenes in a way
 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:09.859
up quietly behind the scenes in a way
that today would be regarded as

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869
that today would be regarded as
 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.110
that today would be regarded as
completely unacceptable and quite

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120
completely unacceptable and quite
 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.240
completely unacceptable and quite
rightly so

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250
rightly so
 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.430
rightly so
in that respect therefore is there an

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440
in that respect therefore is there an
 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.260
in that respect therefore is there an
ultimate answer you know will we all

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270
ultimate answer you know will we all
 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.110
ultimate answer you know will we all
behave ethically no the question is are

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120
behave ethically no the question is are

the mechanisms there to bring them into

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970
the mechanisms there to bring them into
 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.540
the mechanisms there to bring them into
the open and to cope with them and not

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550
the open and to cope with them and not
 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:27.980
the open and to cope with them and not
to eliminate them because we will never

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990
to eliminate them because we will never
 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:30.200
to eliminate them because we will never
do that but to minimize their harmful

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:30.210
do that but to minimize their harmful
 

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:32.750
do that but to minimize their harmful
effects
