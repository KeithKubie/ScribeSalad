00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:03.060
Location and
context are vitally important for

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.340
building the best possible mobile app.

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:08.780
The mobile nature of the platform is
that it is designed to be operated

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:12.410
anywhere, from sitting on a bus,
to sitting in your office, or beyond.

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:17.840
As such, the behavior of your app may
need to change based on your location.

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:21.440
For example, for a weather app such as
Sunshine, that you might have worked on

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:24.400
in the developing Android
app scores here at Udacity.

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.920
Should you really have to
type in your current zip code

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:28.530
in order to get a forecast?

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:30.820
Shouldn't the phone know where you are?

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:33.790
Indeed, if you take a look at
Android Fundamentals Part Two,

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:35.810
you'll learn how to do just that.

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:37.670
Or, for example, a music app.

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:40.650
It's usually great to have a detailed
UI that allows you to search for

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:43.240
your music, but
what happens when you're driving?

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:47.290
Shouldn't there be a less distracting
UI or perhaps voice operation?

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:51.140
In these scenarios, along with countless
others, how your device should behave

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.510
is determined by the location and
context of your phone.

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.800
You'll learn about the powerful APIs
that allow you to determine this

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.620
information for
your phone in a battery friendly way.
