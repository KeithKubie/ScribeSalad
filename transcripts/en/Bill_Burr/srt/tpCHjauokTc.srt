1
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:05,430
Hey, what's going on it's Bill Burr.
It's time for the Thursday afternoon.

2
00:00:05,431 --> 00:00:08,540
Just before Friday. Monday
morning podcasts. And

3
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:12,930
I'm just checking in on you.

4
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:18,240
Checking into something like voices
Juncker just did six shows up in San Jose

5
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:22,820
Cruz.
I've been for the Houston Astros.

6
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:26,100
That was one of my favorite players. Yeah,
my voice is going to be a little tight.

7
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:28,340
It's give me a little rough, you know. Um,

8
00:00:28,341 --> 00:00:31,700
I did six shows up there to
Monday to Tuesday to Wednesday,

9
00:00:31,701 --> 00:00:35,420
just like when I was in Phoenix to
Monday to Tuesday to fucking Wednesday.

10
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:40,720
I'm putting together my new a hour and
I really felt by Wednesday of this week

11
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:45,830
it had gotten to the point where we're
starting to do, starting to take shape.

12
00:00:45,831 --> 00:00:49,880
And I was very happy and I want to
thank everybody who came out, you know,

13
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:50,810
on school nights.

14
00:00:50,811 --> 00:00:53,510
I know you guys all have to work
unless you hit the fucking lottery.

15
00:00:53,511 --> 00:00:55,340
I assumed all he had to
go to work the next day.

16
00:00:55,341 --> 00:00:59,750
So I want to thank everyone in San
Jose who came out to go see me.

17
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:05,150
And, um, thank you for sitting through the
new jokes. I had a great time up there,

18
00:01:05,151 --> 00:01:10,130
worked with Dean del Ray. Fucking
crushed it, crushed it all fucking week.

19
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:13,760
Um, had a great time
working with them, you know,

20
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:18,050
and dean like this is the funny thing
about Dean when I worked with Dean Dean,

21
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,500
you know, he doesn't party or anything
like that. He's done all of that shit.

22
00:01:21,501 --> 00:01:25,520
So He's over it. So then, you know,
I'm, I'm a fucking codependent jackass,

23
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:29,270
you know what I mean? So I mean, to a
point someone's doing coke and heroin,

24
00:01:29,271 --> 00:01:31,520
I'm like, Hey, I'm going to bed. Okay. Um,

25
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:38,210
but it's when it comes to the booze
was smoking cigars, right. That's why,

26
00:01:38,211 --> 00:01:39,620
you know,
me and all my friends,

27
00:01:39,621 --> 00:01:43,430
I mean we're all codepen guys and we just
fucking feed off of each other and it

28
00:01:43,431 --> 00:01:47,750
becomes fucking, you know, animal
house. But, um, so he, he's,

29
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:50,240
he doesn't do that. Right. So
my eyes can be great, you know,

30
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:54,230
I'm not going to spend any extra
money. Busan, no extra calories.

31
00:01:54,231 --> 00:01:56,360
I was hitting the gym, was
doing everything great. But a,

32
00:01:56,361 --> 00:02:01,361
the thing about dean is he has
impeccable taste and shit that I like old

33
00:02:02,511 --> 00:02:04,070
instruments,
old cars.

34
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:08,480
He was showing me this guy that fucking
read does these Porsche nine 11 out here

35
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:12,320
that would just fucking insane,
insane.

36
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:14,990
Like he has all like, you
know, not a lot of stuff,

37
00:02:14,991 --> 00:02:17,450
but he has all top of the line shits.
I was joking with them, I was like,

38
00:02:17,451 --> 00:02:21,980
all the money that I'm going to fucking
not blow in a bar after my show.

39
00:02:21,981 --> 00:02:25,550
I'm then going to spend 10 times more
that on fucking Ebay after I get done

40
00:02:25,551 --> 00:02:29,450
talking to you. But um,
anyways, he murdered it all
week. We had such a great time.

41
00:02:29,451 --> 00:02:33,590
And um, San Jose Improv, that's one of
my favorite places because it's really,

42
00:02:33,591 --> 00:02:37,040
it's really, it's a
small theater, you know,

43
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,930
from the turn of the last century at the,

44
00:02:38,931 --> 00:02:43,490
believe it was built in the 1890s burned
down back when Shit used to burn down

45
00:02:43,491 --> 00:02:46,340
all the time because it was made
out of fucking wood, you know,

46
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,350
as opposed to what now bill, I don't know.
We didn't, they didn't have sprinklers.

47
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:53,540
That's what it was.
When a houses man out of plastic bill,

48
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:57,860
you know, you've been out in
Hollywood so long, you plastic phony,

49
00:02:57,861 --> 00:03:01,690
you think everything's made out of
well then they would melt, right?

50
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:06,820
Plastic is it flammable but just cowers.
You know what I mean?

51
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,010
Like your friend who says,
I got your back, I'm not
going to fucking rat you out.

52
00:03:10,011 --> 00:03:12,020
And then all of a sudden the teacher
comes walking in and he goes,

53
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:15,970
you always had this idea. That's
what plastic is. You know, why?

54
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:19,610
Cause it's manmade. Um, anyway,

55
00:03:19,611 --> 00:03:23,170
so it burned down and then they rebuilt
it in the early 19 hundreds and everyone

56
00:03:23,171 --> 00:03:27,220
from like Harry Houdini, Charlie Chaplin,
they always bring up those two guys.

57
00:03:27,221 --> 00:03:31,150
Nobody ever says a, you know, fatty
Arbuckle played here. Nobody gives a shit.

58
00:03:31,151 --> 00:03:35,650
Right. I love that name. Fatty Arbuckle.
You know, that's back when you just,

59
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:40,390
you said what the person was for better
for worse. You know what I mean? You know,

60
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:45,520
you could just say fatty Arbuckle. Why?
Cause cause he's a fat fuck. You know?

61
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:48,970
Sure. You had a first name. Nobody knows
what it is, but people go, you know,

62
00:03:48,971 --> 00:03:51,130
back then it was great, you
know, you fucking, yeah,

63
00:03:51,131 --> 00:03:53,880
but then people also walk around, drop
for the fucking end work. You know,

64
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:58,700
like they'll ask saying pass the sugar.
But the upside to that was you,

65
00:03:58,701 --> 00:04:02,620
you knew who thought what as opposed to
now wherever he goes, African American,

66
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:06,790
homosexual, vericut, Japanese where
cause and you have no idea who's what.

67
00:04:06,791 --> 00:04:09,580
Everybody's walking around and you feel
like you're in the fucking invasion of

68
00:04:09,581 --> 00:04:12,340
the body snatchers. Who's
thinking what? Right.

69
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,820
Everybody's reading from the same book.
It's not a good God damn thing.

70
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:18,480
I don't even know what the fuck
I'm talking about right now. Um,

71
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:22,210
I literally got off,
got on the earliest flight.

72
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:24,170
I'm doing this thing now
because I want to run home,

73
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:26,620
rush home and see my daughter,
my daughter.

74
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:30,290
But I get home cause I take the earliest
flight out and I'm fucking exhausted.

75
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:35,230
Then I have to go to sleep.
So I'm sucks. I came home,

76
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:38,890
I think she has to remember who I am
just three days away, three days away.

77
00:04:38,891 --> 00:04:43,360
Like as far as what percentage of her
life she was looking at me like making

78
00:04:43,361 --> 00:04:46,360
this face like, who the fuck
is this guy? She didn't cry.

79
00:04:46,361 --> 00:04:48,160
Thank God that would've broke my heart.
But you know,

80
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:52,060
it took me like 20 minutes to
get a smile out of her. Um,

81
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:57,340
what else am I going to do? Want to
get again, nine to five job, you know,

82
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:58,713
drive the fucking

83
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:05,020
Chevy cavalier like, but what the fuck
a lot of you guys are doing right now,

84
00:05:05,021 --> 00:05:07,450
stuck in traffic. I know you don't
want to do that, right? You got dream.

85
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:09,400
Let me tell you something.
You got to,

86
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:13,480
you're going to find that dream and you
got to go after it. I'm kidding. Um,

87
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:15,040
do whatever the fuck you want to do.
You know,

88
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:18,010
there's a lot of times I look at somebody
who's sitting in a cubicle and that

89
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:21,210
will be great. I do, I just
fucking sit there. I just, I,

90
00:05:21,211 --> 00:05:23,470
I go from here to right fucking there,
right?

91
00:05:23,471 --> 00:05:26,410
I just send my chair spins
from this to here. Right?

92
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:28,060
That's my range of fucking motion.

93
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:31,900
I get my job done and I go home and you
know something at this country company

94
00:05:31,901 --> 00:05:36,070
goes under, I don't give a fuck. I've
to just go to another one eight on me.

95
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:41,710
You know that rent to own rental leaf.
That's how you do it anyways.

96
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:45,700
Uh, what's going on in my world?
Other than that, I'm excited.

97
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:48,880
Finally excited about my new hour.
Finally,

98
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:52,780
finally,
af had some fucking jokes.

99
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:58,450
I'm the fucking boss, the Bro and
still, they gotta win tonight.

100
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:02,570
They play in fucking Tampa Bay.
Lightening Down there in Florida.

101
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:07,190
Dude. I know, like fucking 12 people
already fucking move down there.

102
00:06:07,191 --> 00:06:11,450
You know what I mean? It's

103
00:06:11,451 --> 00:06:14,360

can't take the wind anymore.

104
00:06:14,361 --> 00:06:15,740
You're going to lose your edge.
Dope.

105
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:17,060
Yeah,

106
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:19,910

Fucking Bobby McAfee dude.

109

He's always walking around in shorts.
Fucking flip flops,

110
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:34,690
sitting down by a dark, hanging
out with all these fucking Weirdos.

111
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:40,030
Just like, don't you know, look at
you. You're all fucking tanned up.

112
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:45,590
You know it's good, but do you, you got
to come back to, you got to go to donkeys.

113
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:47,430
Yeah.

114
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:50,820
Get to lodge with extra sugar,
um,

115
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:54,000
broads in the middle of a
three game fucking slide.

116
00:06:54,001 --> 00:06:57,750
We lost Edmonton and then
we went over Edmonton,

117
00:06:57,751 --> 00:07:01,620
Alberta and then we went to Toronto,
Ontario and we fucking lost there.

118
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:04,620
And then we went to Ottawa,
the capital, the capital,

119
00:07:04,621 --> 00:07:08,880
ladies and gentlemen of
Canada. I was actually, that's,

120
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,710
I was trying to remember
all the provinces,

121
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:15,750
the provinces and territories is 10
provinces and three territories up there.

122
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:19,910
And I could never fucking remember him
cause most of them begin with n whatever

123
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:24,030
other than enough of them do Nova Scotia,
New Brunswick.

124
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,910
Then there's something in
Labrador retriever or some shit.

125
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:29,580
Yeah.

126
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:32,460
What the fuck is it? New
Brunswick, Nova Scotia,

127
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:37,350
Newfoundland and Labrador. Prince
Edward Island. And the rest easy.

128
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:42,000
You just go on across according to fucking
hockey teams, the Quebec Nordiques,

129
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:48,480
well Toronto may police spent
at the Ontario my beliefs

131
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:56,220
Saskatchewan, Alberta, British
Columbia. Then you go up top,

you got Yukon,

133
00:07:59,401 --> 00:08:01,990

fucking begins with an n.

134
00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:06,330
It sounds like an Italian word,
but it isn't like, forget about it.

135
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:11,430
The fuck is that thing called. This
has to be in the history of podcasting.

136
00:08:11,431 --> 00:08:14,730
The most boring thing anybody's
ever brought up. Canadian.

137
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:17,820

The fuck is it called?

142
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:39,530
Oh yeah. Yeah. None. None of us.

143
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:43,470
Oh no, that's not, doesn't sound
Italian. Hey, we'll have none of that.

144
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:44,900
Okay.

145
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:49,190
Knock it off. No, none of
that. None of that would work.

146
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:54,050
Fuck off. I'm I, I got most of them. I
got most of them. All right, so anyways,

147
00:08:54,051 --> 00:08:56,910
the Bruins are playing Tampa Bay
tonight. We need a wind. You know,

148
00:08:57,060 --> 00:09:00,000
we just fucking beat Edmonton.
We've just want one of those fucking gays.

149
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:03,270
We had little breathing room, a little
breathe in Roman. Now, we don't,

150
00:09:03,271 --> 00:09:07,290
now it's just like, you know, Joe Barton,
Dick taught me, talked me off the ledge,

151
00:09:07,291 --> 00:09:10,290
she goes, you know, they will fucking
tired. They had back to back games.

152
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,420
Don't fucking hit the
panic panic button yet.

153
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,640
But then we lost again to fucking Ottawa.
Okay.

154
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:17,370
So I'm gonna listen to Joe Barton it
cause he knows way more about hockey than

155
00:09:17,371 --> 00:09:19,650
I'll ever fucking know.
But if they lose tonight.

156
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:21,450
Yeah.

157
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:25,340
So we're looking at me possibly three
years in a row of being in the playoffs

158
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:29,630
with two weeks to go in March and then
sitting at home, you know, which uh,

159
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:32,570
Barney gets told me that's the worst
fucking thing to just miss the playoffs.

160
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:35,840
Okay. Cause you don't get any playoff
money and you don't get a good draft pick.

161
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:39,680
But who knows? Maybe somebody
will miss somebody good. I mean,

162
00:09:39,681 --> 00:09:41,030
that's how we got Tom Brady.
Right?

163
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:43,310
Everybody just fucking was
looking at him like, you know,

164
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:48,110
he's got a nice dimple in his
chin. But other than that, I dunno.

165
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:52,520
You can see why they passed a bike and
see why they passed it by when he fucking

166
00:09:52,521 --> 00:09:56,600
dove after you threw that pick six,
you know, and the Superbowl this year.

167
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:57,920
Just look that up.

168
00:09:57,921 --> 00:10:02,900
Him diving to tackle and just look
at how unathletic he looks, you know,

169
00:10:02,901 --> 00:10:07,370
anytime anybody ever says like fucking
out of fucked it all these teams way to

170
00:10:07,371 --> 00:10:11,000
the what? What was he, the fourth round?
Six round. How did they miss this guy?

171
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:14,180
Just show that video and just say,

172
00:10:14,181 --> 00:10:16,910
imagine that running the 40 yard dash.

173
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:22,850
You know what Tom Brady is?
He's a fucking sleep.

174
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:24,861
That's what he is.

175
00:10:24,861 --> 00:10:28,310
He showed up looking like a Volvo station
wagon and they didn't realize what was

176
00:10:28,311 --> 00:10:31,700
under the hood. You know what
it was? It was a four 54,

177
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:35,240
454 cubic kids.
She's a fucking hat.

178
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:40,100
I'm sorry. Alright. Plowing ahead. Um,

179
00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:45,830
other sports talk Formula One starts on
this Sunday if you want to get into it

180
00:10:45,831 --> 00:10:47,960
like I did last year and last year,

181
00:10:47,961 --> 00:10:52,961
the Mercedes Benz team with Lewis Hamilton
and Nico Rosberg the sense retired

182
00:10:53,181 --> 00:10:56,780
Nico Rosberg cause he wanted to hang out
with his daughter, which I didn't fuck.

183
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:57,350
Or his kid,

184
00:10:57,350 --> 00:11:01,160
which I didn't understand until I came
home after three days in San Jose.

185
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:05,300
And my own daughter's looking at
me like, uh, it's just a driver.

186
00:11:05,301 --> 00:11:09,520
Who the hell is this guy? Um, who knows?

187
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:14,500
I always, I always want to blame the
woman, you know, that his wife was like,

188
00:11:14,501 --> 00:11:17,920
it's really dangerous. I mean,
you won the championship. I mean,

189
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:20,880
this whole thing with Louis,
it's just, it's, it's you, it's,

190
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:24,970
you talk about it all the time. We can't
even sit down for a meal. I get it.

191
00:11:24,971 --> 00:11:28,060
You think he's a cunt, but
you know, I just, what about,

192
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:32,160
did you just be here with me?

193
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:33,850
Yeah.

194
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:36,270
You know, that's the danger of
being with the wrong woman. You,

195
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:39,350
you end up stepping out of a formula
one car and just say, hey, you know,

196
00:11:39,530 --> 00:11:41,150
one or maybe he's smart.

197
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:44,390
Maybe he's just like that guy who plays
blackjack and goes up early and just

198
00:11:44,391 --> 00:11:45,650
says, Hey, you know what? Fuck this.

199
00:11:45,651 --> 00:11:49,010
I'm going back to the room taking my
money and I'm going back to the fucking

200
00:11:49,011 --> 00:11:49,850
room.
I have no idea.

201
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:52,160
I don't even understand this God
damn sport to be honest with you.

202
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:55,600
I still don't what happened to the
steering wheel and why it looks like a

203
00:11:55,601 --> 00:11:56,770
fucking game boy now.

204
00:11:57,490 --> 00:12:02,490
And how the fuck sitting there
like driving that Goddamn fast.

205
00:12:02,741 --> 00:12:06,040
You have time to take your hand off the
wheel and fucking search for that button

206
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:10,120
to pick a new, uh, a new suspension.

207
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:13,830
Like you're in a Tesla with your friend
driving up fucking route to, hey,

208
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:16,810
you want me to put it in an insane
fucking mode? Whatever the hell it is,

209
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:20,050
except they're doing this shit
at 200 miles an hour. By the way,

210
00:12:20,051 --> 00:12:22,330
I went by a Tesla dealership
when I was up in, uh,

211
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:29,380
San Jose and, um, they have, uh,

212
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:32,400
they're the new one up there, you
know, that it had, it had, you know,

213
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:36,790
the original ones just had the
motor, um, for the rear wheels.

214
00:12:36,791 --> 00:12:40,780
Now they got one for the front and
the back. And evidently it goes,

215
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:45,500
we need to get the top of the
line, the best one, right. It's,

216
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:48,660
it's limited with them. It's just
like what, what gives it, um,

217
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:53,380
makes it worth more money is the amount
of fucking electrical power you have.

218
00:12:53,381 --> 00:12:54,970
It's all a bit,
cause everything other than that,

219
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:59,050
I think they're pretty much all the same.
And if you get the top of the line one,

220
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:04,990
um, it goes zero to 60 in 2.5
seconds. That's like a fucking,

221
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:06,880
that's motorcycles level speed.

222
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:09,423
MMM.

223
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:14,810
And it's a four door. Looks like a
fucking Nissan Maxima. Not even know.

224
00:13:14,811 --> 00:13:15,610
It doesn't look like that.

225
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:19,750
It looks like maybe like a Toyota super
fucked in Nissan masks at maximum.

226
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:20,593
One of those late,

227
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:22,613
mmm.

228
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:28,410
Late eighties. Once. Um, was
it the super, the Celica?

229
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:30,690
I can't fucking remember.
All I know is,

230
00:13:30,691 --> 00:13:35,040
you know what car I would love to fucking
own for like a year is one of those

231
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:39,000
like a 71 or 72 like Datsun five 10.

232
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:44,550
Just have the whole fucking thing redone.
Um, I, I gotta be honest with you.

233
00:13:44,551 --> 00:13:46,740
I you're, I'm hard pressed
to find a fucking car that I,

234
00:13:46,741 --> 00:13:49,950
that I can't see that would be fun
to drive. You know what I mean?

235
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,330
So there's so many fucking great
cars out there. The only ones I, I,

236
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:55,710
I'm not really interested in is all
the American muscle cars at this point

237
00:13:55,890 --> 00:13:58,440
because they're just fucking everywhere.
Everybody has one.

238
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:02,610
Every time you put on Mika and we've
got some more power power coming up and

239
00:14:02,611 --> 00:14:05,880
it's the same guy comes a coup de,
it comes a fucking Amie.

240
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:10,530
This hemi that it comes to Shelby
here comes to fucking, you know,

241
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:15,660
the day I only made a couple of
these Camaro's so 19 fucking 69,

242
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:18,640
you know, this is a
Mustang boss. It's there.

243
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:22,500
They're all fighting over the same
fucking three models. Meanwhile,

244
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:25,530
is all these other fucking
cool as cars out there. Um,

245
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:29,130
I'm actually glad that the baby boomers
are still infatuate that cause it keeps

246
00:14:29,131 --> 00:14:32,870
the prices down of the shit that I like.
Um,

247
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:38,620
yeah, I'm a fucking Weirdo dude. I like
those. Ford does Ford vans from the 60s.

248
00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:41,440
You know, it's just a
shame that, you know,

249
00:14:41,441 --> 00:14:46,240
a couple of fucking serial killers that
dressed up like clowns drove around in

250
00:14:46,241 --> 00:14:50,230
vans. They really ruined the name of
them. But what did the upside of that?

251
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:54,530
The upside of pedophilia
is if you're into vans,

252
00:14:54,531 --> 00:14:55,880
you can get one for really cheap.

253
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:02,720
The trade off is you can never grow
a mustache for the rest of your life.

254
00:15:02,721 --> 00:15:05,210
That's it. Um, anyway,

255
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:10,220
so for Formula One starts this Sunday
in Australia and last year then Mercedes

256
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:14,240
Benz teams where the a was with
um, Mercedes van team, sorry,

257
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:18,710
was the team to beat in this year.
Evidently the Ferrari's are, uh,

258
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:23,120
are looking like they're going
to be really strong and a,

259
00:15:23,121 --> 00:15:26,450
I guess everybody's rooting for who is it?
Who the fuck is the Australian driver?

260
00:15:26,451 --> 00:15:31,070
Therefore, the, uh, the red bull
team, he's coming down there.

261
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:35,420
What the fuck's his name?
What's his name? Uh,

262
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,640
Daniel. Ricardo. Hello.

263
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:39,753
Okay.

264
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:44,760
You're getting ready to leave.
Does she still remember who I am?

265
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:51,060
She was looking at me like, who the
hell is this guy? All right sweetie.

266
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,630
Go ahead at that though.
Huh? I ain't get a smile.

267
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:58,380
Can I get a, she's staring at
the microphone. I liked that.

268
00:15:58,381 --> 00:16:02,320
How are you going to get in
Showbiz? No, no. Treat me like food.

269
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:06,210
Yeah, I think she's kind of over me.
Let me hang with it for like two,

270
00:16:06,211 --> 00:16:11,100
three hours today. Get that bond
back. Get the bond back. Yeah.

271
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:15,000
Can you see by data?
She's just staring at it.

272
00:16:15,001 --> 00:16:18,390
She'd read a look at a pillow then
me. Hey Buddy. You remember me?

273
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:23,490
Look at me. Who Do you think
paid for that? Onesy that was me.

274
00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:28,680
Nothing. She's looking
down. She's got no interest.

275
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:33,690
Unbelievable. That's the kind of charisma
I have. All right. You guys go have fun.

276
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:37,650
Okay. Bye. I'll see you. Bye everybody
on the clock and ass. All right,

277
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:43,580
bye. See you later. To my two ways. Um,

278
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:48,420
all right. So, um, she
didn't look at me once. Um,

279
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:52,470
whenever I understand. Okay. It's
a brand new brain still working.

280
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:56,790
She's putting together her shit. The way
I'm putting together my act. You got,

281
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,860
or she already doesn't like me, but you
know, I really can't blame them. Um,

282
00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:03,450
Daniel Ricardo is the guy,
but here's the thing about him.

283
00:17:03,451 --> 00:17:07,560
Everybody in Australia claims the guy.
All right,

284
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:12,360
which is bullshit I think because he
didn't move to fucking Australia till he

285
00:17:12,361 --> 00:17:16,770
was seven. He came from
Sicily. Alright. I bet.

286
00:17:16,771 --> 00:17:20,910
I bet he's got some stories about
everybody teasing them with this fucking

287
00:17:20,911 --> 00:17:23,850
accent when he first showed up to
Australia, but he's got some stories.

288
00:17:23,851 --> 00:17:27,900
Any Sicilian, so you know, you
know, he never forgets whatever.

289
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:31,830
Australia will like your claim them maybe
you got kicked out like all those Brits

290
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:35,670
incentive, that fucking
land. Who knows. But, um,

291
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,290
so everybody's going to be pulling for
him. I can't fucking wait. I can't,

292
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:42,960
I can't believe how excited I am for
this shit that I finally stuck it through

293
00:17:42,961 --> 00:17:44,850
one of those whole seasons
and I'm totally into it.

294
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:48,960
So I'm probably borne a lot
of you, but um, who knows.
All right, let's get to the,

295
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:52,050
let's get system all bullshit here.
Um,

296
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:54,600
did I already talk about everything?
Oh,

297
00:17:54,601 --> 00:17:58,620
you know what else I did
when I was up there? Um, the
Improv up, they have found a,

298
00:17:58,621 --> 00:18:03,450
a, a drum room for me and on two
days I got to play for two hours,

299
00:18:03,451 --> 00:18:06,060
both fucking days.
I snuck four hours in.

300
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:10,620
That's what I do when I'm on the road
cause I can't really play drums, you know,

301
00:18:10,621 --> 00:18:14,220
as much as I like, which is basically
an hour to two hours every fucking day.

302
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:16,410
I can't do that anymore.
Now I get out, you know,

303
00:18:16,411 --> 00:18:19,470
a couple a couple of
days a week if I'm lucky,

304
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:23,340
but I got the whole practice pad
kit and all that shit here. So, um,

305
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:25,950
I got to go out and do that shit.

306
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:30,810
See how awful my playing is now. It was
really fucking depressing, you know,

307
00:18:30,811 --> 00:18:34,170
but it was still a good time.
Um, all right, here we go.
Let's, let's read a little,

308
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,033
Oh,
you know what?

309
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,330
I have announcements I have to do if I
sound like I'm all over the place cause I

310
00:18:39,331 --> 00:18:43,830
got like two hours.
Fucking sleep flight was at like 6:50 AM,

311
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,540
you know, and I, I never,

312
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:50,100
I usually don't do a podcast when I flew
the same fucking day. So. All right.

313
00:18:50,101 --> 00:18:51,120
What am I supposed to do here?
Oh,

314
00:18:51,121 --> 00:18:54,990
I have to remind the listeners
about Deanna Adler's,

315
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:57,540
Steven Adler's mom.
Um,

316
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:01,860
I interviewed her with Steven
Adler and um, Jamie Adler,

317
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:07,560
um, that was posted yesterday.
Please listen to it. And um,

318
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:08,850
Steven's mother,

319
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:13,880
mother is going to be at Barnes and
noble doing a book signing a week from

320
00:19:15,601 --> 00:19:20,370
yesterday.
So that will be the 29th,

321
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:25,410
March 29th. She's going to be there. Let
me make, let me double check on them.

322
00:19:25,411 --> 00:19:27,480
Make sure I don't fuck that up.
That would be a bad thing.

323
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:32,190
That would defeat the purpose of them
coming on here. All right. Where am I?

324
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:36,210
Where am I? Um, yeah,

325
00:19:36,211 --> 00:19:41,211
the 29th at 7:00 PM at the growth
on Fairfax here in Los Angeles.

326
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:48,780
Um, she's gonna be at
the, uh, at the fucking,

327
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:53,550
at the God damn mall down there where they
used to have two stadiums, by the way.

328
00:19:54,410 --> 00:19:58,230
We used to have a football stadium down
there and they used to have a baseball

329
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,080
state and we have you ever watched those
old school black and white home run

330
00:20:01,081 --> 00:20:02,670
derbies and you wonder where they are.

331
00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:05,340
I always thought they were liking like
the Washington senators, the original,

332
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:09,150
you know, Washington Senators Ballpark,
but they were actually out here in la,

333
00:20:09,151 --> 00:20:12,480
which makes sense because it's
a fucking TV show anyways,

334
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:16,080
now it's a CBS slot and where
all that shit stood, you know,

335
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:19,590
they knocked it all down and then they
did like 9 million episodes of the prices.

336
00:20:19,591 --> 00:20:23,520
Right. So you know what the
world moves ahead. All right.

337
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:28,140
In don't China, sorry. Just blew out
your ear. Drums, Indochina, everybody.

338
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:31,440
Chino.
Talk about how um,

339
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:35,580
a made to measure suit fits compared
to a generic off the rack suit.

340
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:38,250
And now every man looks better in a suit.
Hey,

341
00:20:38,251 --> 00:20:41,160
why don't you fucking write
something and I'll, I'll read that.

342
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:43,950
I gotta sit here and riff.
You know,

343
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:46,740
they used to do that to comedians way back
in the day. They probably still do it.

344
00:20:46,741 --> 00:20:50,980
We used to go on for commercial auditions
and you'd show up and then you know,

345
00:20:51,010 --> 00:20:53,830
there's no coffee, there's no coffee.
They just want to see personality.

346
00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:57,390
And then you'd go in there and you hold
up the product and you'd sit there,

347
00:20:57,560 --> 00:21:00,940
riff and all this shit. And then
they would just steal all your jokes.

348
00:21:00,941 --> 00:21:02,920
They wouldn't hire you.
And then they'd write the copy.

349
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:07,300
Well I think I told this story,

350
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:11,350
Patrice fucking called them out on it.
That's right.

351
00:21:11,351 --> 00:21:14,110
I think I told this actually recently.
200 I'm standing there it goes.

352
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:18,940
He just walked in with like a can of coke
and just stared all three of them down.

353
00:21:18,941 --> 00:21:20,860
Just so what?
What is this horse shit?

354
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:25,570
They all imploded and told them exactly
what the fuck they were doing. All right.

355
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:30,040
Do I really need the riff about this?
Okay. Do you know, unless you're,

356
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:34,390
unless you're fucking the exact same
measurements of a mannequin, you know,

357
00:21:34,570 --> 00:21:37,030
you're not, something's going gonna look
fucked up. He just not gonna look right.

358
00:21:37,031 --> 00:21:40,390
Okay. If you have a suit that's
fucking tailor made to your body,

359
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:45,130
obviously you have a by a
talk for your car. You know,

360
00:21:45,131 --> 00:21:47,380
if you buy the one for your model,
your model car,

361
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:50,110
it fits like a glove as opposed
to just getting some generic one.

362
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:52,360
It's a little gust of wind
and it blows right off.

363
00:21:52,990 --> 00:21:56,140
Do you want your suit pants to come
flying off and then you Dick's peeking out

364
00:21:56,141 --> 00:22:00,550
of your boxers at the Christmas party
or do you want to fit suit? Well,

365
00:22:00,551 --> 00:22:04,510
thank God for Indo Chino and dope child,
whatever the fuck they are,

366
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:09,640
they making it easy to get a perfectly
tailored suit and an incredible price.

367
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:14,260
You can choose from hundreds
of top quality fat. Are
there hundreds of fabrics?

368
00:22:14,261 --> 00:22:18,430
How many are there? It's like
cotton silk and ray on in my world.

369
00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:22,390
The fuck else is there?
Plastic leather.

370
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:29,250
Yeah, that's it. I thought there was
less fabrics and there was fucking banks.

371
00:22:30,370 --> 00:22:31,203
Um,

372
00:22:32,270 --> 00:22:36,200
that individual banks and mean like
chase wells Fargo. That's what the fuck.

373
00:22:36,530 --> 00:22:40,950
Hey Bill, why don't you just read the
copy? All right, fucking relax. All right.

374
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:44,850
You can choose from hundreds of top
quality fabrics and personalize your suit

375
00:22:44,851 --> 00:22:49,140

377
00:22:56,930 --> 00:22:59,180
Yeah.
What are you running for office?

378
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:00,730
Yeah.

379
00:23:00,730 --> 00:23:01,700
What did he comment at town?

380
00:23:01,701 --> 00:23:04,850
Are you going to sell all the fucking
rubes their instruments that don't exist?

381
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:10,070
Indochino has a suited up as suited up

It's not my house. Thank fucking
God. It's the house next door.

reason I'm probably gives us 7
billion people live out here, right?

433
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:39,110
Distilled genes, everybody. Great jeans.
Oh, they don't have to be complicated. No,

434
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:44,040

459
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:08,813
MMM.

460
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:13,330
Oh Shit. It's national small
business month. It always is.

461
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:15,130
And legal zoom.com.

462
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:19,120
You know something that national small
business month is like when you have some

463
00:28:19,610 --> 00:28:21,080
shithole store that
always has that sign up,

464
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:24,430
but that they're going out of business
going out of business and they're in

465
00:28:24,431 --> 00:28:27,730
business for like another
10 years. Um, anyways,

466
00:28:27,731 --> 00:28:30,160
national small business
month@legalzoom.com is,

Proven rates for business loans are up.
Oh Great.

469
00:28:36,970 --> 00:28:39,100
And so is computer consumer confidence,

470
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:44,470
but it takes a lot more than a good
timing to launch a successful business.

471
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:49,210

Did I write that sentence?

485
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:34,470
I could spend 20 minutes trying
to break that fucking thing down.

486

Trying to figure is that a fragment? Is
that a run on? There's no obligation.

April everybody. Just a lot of great

488
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:44,620
It's not them.
Why would you think that?

489
00:29:45,370 --> 00:29:47,110
Just because it says
legal in their name right?

490

But they're dedicated to make life

That's legal zoom.com/startup
oh guess what?

495
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:06,830
I wanted to thank somebody,

496
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:11,870
somebody on Twitter send me a,

497
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:16,580
somebody uploaded an entire Boston
Bruins versus the Chicago Blackhawks from

498
00:30:16,581 --> 00:30:19,880
1974 and it's the Bruins feed.

499
00:30:19,881 --> 00:30:24,140
So it's Fred Cusak doing the game.
Spoiler alert,

500
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:28,340
the Chicago Blackhawks win the face off.
They win the draw.

501
00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:33,110
It goes back to Stan Mikita who
shoots it down to the Bruins and,

502
00:30:33,111 --> 00:30:38,000
and it's then picked up by Bobby your
and it's, it's the whole fucking game.

503
00:30:38,001 --> 00:30:41,360
I just sat there and it's a great,
great quality.

504
00:30:42,170 --> 00:30:44,780
I hope nobody goes into fucking
takes it down. It's unbelievable.

505
00:30:44,781 --> 00:30:46,520
If you just want to check it out,
like um,

506
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:51,530
the first thing I always noticed aside
from no helmets is like how small the

507
00:30:51,531 --> 00:30:55,130
goalies are. It's like the one of
these guys scored like a fucking,

508
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:58,850
everybody was scoring 50 goals by
so many people scored 50 back then.

509
00:31:00,230 --> 00:31:03,710
These guys barely took up. Like it looks
like a third of the net standup goalies.

510
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:07,220
You know, they played goalie, they look,
they look like they're in the Rockettes.

511
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:12,290
Cats just fucking kick their legs
out and shit. But it's, it's um,

512
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:16,520
I'll you know, I'll actually, I'll
maybe I'll put a link to it, um,

513
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:22,250
from the podcast and podcast or at
the MMP. Is that what the Twitter is?

514
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:26,120
I have no fucking idea. Um,
anyways, that's the, uh,

515
00:31:26,121 --> 00:31:29,150
that's the podcast here for this Thursday.
I got something I got to go do.

516
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:31,490
I apologize. I know it was a
little scatterbrained here,

517
00:31:31,491 --> 00:31:35,210
but however you can listen to some nice
music and then listen to a podcast,

518
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:39,440
um, from, I don't know when, I don't
know when it's going to be. It's from,

519
00:31:39,470 --> 00:31:43,610
from yesteryear. When I was a little bit
younger, my brain wasn't as scattered.

520
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:45,980
Brad, it's always been scatterbrained.
Whose kid too? All right,

521
00:31:46,010 --> 00:31:49,270
please enjoy the next half
of the podcast and I'm,

522
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:51,990
have a nice weekend.
You'd cuts.

523
00:31:54,630 --> 00:31:55,710
Hey,
what's going on?

524
00:31:57,060 --> 00:32:02,010
And this is the Monday morning
podcast for March 25th, 2009

525
00:32:03,690 --> 00:32:07,590
a fucking podcast is to start to
feel like groundhog day for me.

526
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:11,970
I'm going to be a little grumpy, a little
extra grumpy this week because, uh,

527
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:16,350
I don't what happened. I uh,
well I do know what happened. Um,

528
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:21,800
I went out drinking last night and I
stayed out until about two in the morning

529
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:23,820
and,
uh,

530
00:32:23,821 --> 00:32:28,821
I was driving home and I saw coyote and
I slowed down and for some reason felt

531
00:32:28,921 --> 00:32:33,510
the need to yell at it, you know,
just to see what it would do.

532
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:36,330
Because according to Black Comedians,

533
00:32:36,331 --> 00:32:40,700
that's what white people do around wild
animals. And Damn, I am the stereotype.

534
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:44,000
If Dad was a black mother fucker,
shit,

535
00:32:44,030 --> 00:32:46,380
he kept driving down
the mother fucking room.

536
00:32:48,450 --> 00:32:53,160
Why person be pulling over? Go over
there. What the fuck are you doing? Huh?

537
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:57,410
You want to bite me in the ass?
That's literally what the fuck I did.

538
00:32:57,411 --> 00:33:02,411
I was a hacky def jam bet and those
were two of the worst impressions of two

539
00:33:03,471 --> 00:33:08,270
races you're ever gonna hear. Um, but go
fuck yourself. I'm still in my pajamas.

540
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:12,020
You wear pajamas bill. Um,
when it's cold in my apartment,

541
00:33:12,021 --> 00:33:16,270
I do still comfortable with my sexuality.
Um,

542
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:18,770
let me tell you something.

543
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:22,640
If you wear pajamas as a man
and you don't have a child,

544
00:33:23,310 --> 00:33:26,930
you're just, you're a fucking, I don't
know what, but you're not something,

545
00:33:26,931 --> 00:33:31,931
I want to be around these Pajama bottoms
in my way of saying that I hate myself.

546
00:33:32,570 --> 00:33:36,630
Oh, Bill, why would you
say that? Um, anyways, yes.

547
00:33:36,631 --> 00:33:40,970
So I just pulled over and I started
yelling at this coyote.

548
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:46,520
I don't even want to sound like, hey,
hey, let's see if we do something.

549
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:50,180
Then I started whistling at him,
you know, not in like a sexual way.

550
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:53,180
I'm not a creep. I was whistling
of that monkey was domesticated.

551
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:58,150
I just want to see if I could fuck
them up, you know, just don't come.

552
00:33:58,340 --> 00:34:00,620
You come here,
can we boy.

553
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:06,740
And the thing was looking at me like,
dude, are you serious? And I was like, no,

554
00:34:06,741 --> 00:34:09,740
not really. I just want to see what
you would do. You fucking cunt.

555
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:16,060
And then I drove home and I had some
Salami and some horseradish cheddar cheese

556
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:22,910
and uh, oh, you know what I got the
other day, I got this new Sam Adams.

557
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:26,930
Um, I really am a Douche bag
this week I'm wearing pajamas,

558
00:34:26,931 --> 00:34:29,540
I'm drinking Sam Adams.
Um,

559
00:34:29,740 --> 00:34:32,870
if I have a story that involves me
having a sandwich with an olive in it,

560
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:37,220
you guys should really just unsubscribed
to my podcast at this point.

561
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,080
Or maybe any story when I'm standing
here in a blazer with a pipe. Um,

562
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:47,360
yeah, I bought this new Sam
Adams Beer, like, uh, you know,

563
00:34:47,361 --> 00:34:52,280
they have like the seasonal ones. What
is it that the blackberry something beer.

564
00:34:52,310 --> 00:34:56,030
I know it sounds gross, right?
That's what I was thinking. I'm like,

565
00:34:56,031 --> 00:34:58,720
that sounds gross. I'm
like, but it's Sam Adams.

566
00:34:58,721 --> 00:35:00,260
Somehow they make this shit tastes good.

567
00:35:00,410 --> 00:35:02,870
That Sherry Week Cherry wheat
was something that bears,

568
00:35:02,871 --> 00:35:06,530
I drank and I thought it was the
most delicious beer I ever had.

569
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:11,710
And by the third one I felt like I
had eaten a whole bag of candy and um,

570
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:15,670
I was like, I need to stop. But I still
get those. I like to somewhere else.

571
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,570
I think it's fucking,
you know what it was,

572
00:35:17,571 --> 00:35:22,571
I had just seen a Sam Adams commercial
and I fucking challenge you to not want

573
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:25,880
to go drink 12 beers at the
scene of Sam Adams commercial.

574
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:29,180
You don't get to see those commercials.
And the guy sticks his fucking face.

575
00:35:29,270 --> 00:35:34,070
And those hops
grabs two big handfuls.

576
00:35:34,071 --> 00:35:37,500
They show how many extra hops they put in,
which I don't even know what does.

577
00:35:37,530 --> 00:35:39,210
Evidently it makes it more tasty.

578
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:44,540
And then when they put it in that
fucking that beer glass shape shape,

579
00:35:44,731 --> 00:35:48,870
like a voluptuous woman, you know,
and it just looks that perfect color.

580
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:53,040
That's what was in my head. And I was at
the grocery store, I was like, aw man,

581
00:35:53,041 --> 00:35:56,850
they got a new flavor and that guy's
face in the hops that's very sexual.

582
00:35:56,851 --> 00:35:59,400
Like he's gotta use,
buried his face in some chick's pussy.

583
00:35:59,730 --> 00:36:03,390
And in the end they show her all
filled up and fulfilled, you know,

584
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:08,310
all filled up and fulfill as
a sentence for you. So anyway,

585
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:11,370
black berry sweeter the best.
I'm like darker the Berry.

586
00:36:11,371 --> 00:36:13,140
The sweeter the juice they got me.

587
00:36:13,170 --> 00:36:15,210
They all went sex on me
and I fucking bought it.

588
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:18,660
And I will tell you that was the worst
goddamn tasting beer I've ever had my

589
00:36:18,661 --> 00:36:22,650
fucking life. Okay. You know, I'm
a big fan of these smaller brewers,

590
00:36:22,651 --> 00:36:26,640
even though they're huge. Sam Adams
is huge now, but I'll tell you, Sammy,

591
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:30,120
you missed the mark on that one.
Cause that tasted like a,

592
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:31,500
I don't know what it tasted like.

593
00:36:33,450 --> 00:36:36,670
It tasted like Sam Adams
armpit. Okay, that's good.

594
00:36:39,350 --> 00:36:40,990
That didn't even make sense.
Understood this.

595
00:36:41,810 --> 00:36:46,360
Avoid the Sam Adams blackberry. Whatever
the fuck it's called. It's like,

596
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:51,390
what the fuck was I thinking blackberry?
What the advertisement should that for?

597
00:36:51,391 --> 00:36:55,410
That shit should be, it should be. It's
not a wine cooler. It's not a beer.

598
00:36:56,770 --> 00:37:00,810
Or maybe like it's a bad cop buddy
movie. You know, he's a beer,

599
00:37:01,110 --> 00:37:05,620
he's a wine cooler and together
they tastes like ass. What is it?

600
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:09,520
I'm actually in my refrigerator
right now. The blackberry. Ah,

601
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:15,210
Jesus. I can't pronounce it
with beer wit B. I. E. R.

602
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:19,480
Is it some, a fancy German
way of spelling, uh,

603
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:22,200
whatever fucking word that's supposed
to be. And that's not a word.

604
00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:26,130
There's no space between it.
I didn't want the fuck that is

605
00:37:28,510 --> 00:37:31,800
and yeah,
I feel like I'm in Woodstock right now.

606
00:37:31,801 --> 00:37:35,610
You ever see that thing where they're
like, stay away from the red tabs, man.

607
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:39,570
I'm telling you.
Stay away from the Black Berry,

608
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:44,580
Sam Adams with beer. All right?
It's not a good fucking scene.

609
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:49,770
It's not a good fucking
scene. And yes, Jesus Christ,
that's it. I'm done with that.

610
00:37:49,890 --> 00:37:53,730
Anytime there's any
sort of fruit in a beer,

611
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:58,680
you gotta be done. Although I
do like, what does that beer,

612
00:37:58,681 --> 00:38:02,250
they put the slice of orange and the,
uh,

613
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:06,660
I'm just really going to just say one
Douche bag thing about my personality

614
00:38:06,661 --> 00:38:11,010
after another on this podcast.
This is what it is. You know,

615
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:16,200
if for some reason, one of you finds
me to be your hero and you, uh,

616
00:38:16,590 --> 00:38:20,790
took out the CD cover and taped
it on the ceiling above your bed,

617
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:26,160
you know, I just realized I don't
have a poster myself. What kind of,

618
00:38:26,161 --> 00:38:30,750
what kind of fucking entertainer
am I that I don't have that poster.

619
00:38:30,751 --> 00:38:33,870
You know what I mean? When I'm
standing under the tree, you know,

620
00:38:33,871 --> 00:38:38,290
both hands up on the tree branch above
me with the little sea shell necklace and

621
00:38:38,291 --> 00:38:39,790
my shirt opened down to my name

622
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:45,550
Sean Cassidy poster a,
that's when you know you made it.

623
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,650
That's when you know you made it.
When you're,

624
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:51,340
when you're posing for that picture and
nobody around you is telling you it's a

625
00:38:51,341 --> 00:38:54,670
bad idea, that's when you know
you made it. That's when you know,

626
00:38:54,671 --> 00:38:57,190
because you have making
so much fucking money.

627
00:38:57,550 --> 00:39:02,550
People are afraid to tell you that
maybe you shouldn't be sitting on a tire

628
00:39:02,921 --> 00:39:05,650
swing with one leg in the air,
you know,

629
00:39:06,870 --> 00:39:11,080
for the poster of your
upcoming tour. Um, okay.

630
00:39:11,081 --> 00:39:15,970
That was a long way to go to do a
Shaun Cassidy reference. Um, anyways,

631
00:39:15,971 --> 00:39:20,860
this is the Monday morning podcast and uh,
if you are new to my page

632
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:26,500
of my website or my myspace page,
um,

633
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:29,410
welcome.
I did one of these every single Monday.

634
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:34,440
And people send me a list of questions
of Co Weston's not questions,

635
00:39:34,661 --> 00:39:37,930
questions, because it is the internet. Um,

636
00:39:38,470 --> 00:39:41,640
they send me lists of questions and I,
uh,

637
00:39:41,850 --> 00:39:44,290
try to answer them to
the best of my ability.

638
00:39:46,310 --> 00:39:50,920
I fucking pajamas are killing me. I'm
fucking up with my brain. I don't know.

639
00:39:50,921 --> 00:39:55,480
I gotta let my brain this week, Clint,
my fucking brain. What am I freaking,

640
00:39:55,481 --> 00:39:57,670
I'm freaking out about something right
now and I can't even figure out what the

641
00:39:57,671 --> 00:40:00,670
fuck it is. Um, but anyways,

642
00:40:00,671 --> 00:40:05,230
I do this podcast every single week.
Yeah. They send me questions, questions,

643
00:40:05,290 --> 00:40:09,660
and they, uh, send me their list of
underrated, overrated things. They, uh,

644
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:13,480
give me movie reviews. They asked me for
advice. They tell me to go fuck myself.

645
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:15,790
Every once in awhile,
someone such a concert,

646
00:40:15,791 --> 00:40:19,120
they become douche bag
of the week and a in.

647
00:40:19,121 --> 00:40:22,980
Lately people have been sending
me stories about revenge. Um,

648
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:27,790
which I find fascinating because
that's one of the few evils that I've,

649
00:40:28,390 --> 00:40:30,940
uh,
I've actually resisted.

650
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:33,490
I have not partaked in,

651
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:38,350
um oh before I get too deep into this
podcast and we'll let you guys know that

652
00:40:38,351 --> 00:40:40,390
my, uh, my standup special,

653
00:40:40,391 --> 00:40:45,190
why do I do this evidently is on demand.
So,

654
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:48,430
uh, if you want to have
a little party, you know,

655
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:54,180
get out your little fucking tea cups and
a table that's way too big for you to

656
00:40:54,221 --> 00:40:56,530
be sitting at. Cause that's what
you do at a tea party though. Yeah.

657
00:40:57,550 --> 00:41:00,130
Does anybody over the age of
five have a fucking tea party?

658
00:41:00,370 --> 00:41:05,230
So they do that over in England or do
they just have fucking tea and just sit

659
00:41:05,231 --> 00:41:09,680
there and stare out of
the clouds? Um, all right,

660
00:41:09,850 --> 00:41:12,190
let's get on with the podcast.
Okay. That was my opening.

661
00:41:12,191 --> 00:41:17,020
Just burst of energy trying to make
this fucking thing funny because, uh,

662
00:41:17,050 --> 00:41:21,400
I only got five hours sleep last
night. Ah, poor fucking baby.

663
00:41:21,401 --> 00:41:23,980
You only got five hours sleep and now
what are you gonna do with the lay around

664
00:41:23,981 --> 00:41:26,200
the next day, the rest of the
day and you fucking pajamas.

665
00:41:27,430 --> 00:41:32,430
You know what about me and the fucking
work and man Trican boilermakers till in

666
00:41:33,471 --> 00:41:36,020
the morning.
Now I'm operating heavy machinery.

667
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:41,330
Go Fuck Yourself. It's not
my fault. Okay. Fuck you.

668
00:41:41,331 --> 00:41:44,660
You're doing heavy machinery that makes
you make when like fucking 30 bucks an

669
00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:49,370
hour, 30 bucks an hour to take
down a mountain. All right.

670
00:41:49,730 --> 00:41:53,210
That made no sense. What's
so fucking ever, um,

671
00:41:54,830 --> 00:41:56,480
I just have a bunch of random notes here.

672
00:41:56,750 --> 00:42:01,490
Notes that I've made over the past week.
Here's an idea. I had it. An airport,

673
00:42:01,950 --> 00:42:04,070
nothing suffers like the
luggage of fat people.

674
00:42:05,990 --> 00:42:09,230
And I don't know how I came up with that.
I know what it was.

675
00:42:09,231 --> 00:42:13,880
I just saw this woman dragging her
wheelie sideways. Or was it a guy?

676
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:17,750
I can't remember.
Once you get to that size,

677
00:42:17,751 --> 00:42:21,440
does it really matter if you think
about that? It's become so big.

678
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:26,000
You'd just come asexual, this is my,
uh, late night DJ voice, sort of,

679
00:42:26,550 --> 00:42:29,570
uh, trying to convince you with some
things. Um, all right. That was creepy.

680
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:32,390
I'm sorry. All right, let's, do
you want to talk about creepy?

681
00:42:32,391 --> 00:42:37,220
Let's talk about how Obama,
uh, President Obama, oh, uh,

682
00:42:37,730 --> 00:42:40,250
Barack Obama was on the
tonight show this week.

683
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:45,980
Did that disturb anyone as a
fucking American? Is he in dude,

684
00:42:45,981 --> 00:42:48,140
where's my car part too?
You know,

685
00:42:48,141 --> 00:42:51,280
what the fuck are you doing on the
tonight show? I got a big idea,

686
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:55,470
my girlfriend about that,
and I said, ah, it's good.

687
00:42:55,580 --> 00:42:59,480
It's a great way to reach people.
It's like,

688
00:42:59,481 --> 00:43:03,140
why don't you ever fucking
press conference, right?

689
00:43:03,141 --> 00:43:06,290
I gotta do is we'll at that podium, the
whole world sits around and watches it.

690
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:11,120
I'm like, I couldn't, I couldn't,
I couldn't sit there and watch it.

691
00:43:11,270 --> 00:43:14,300
You know what I mean? I, it's like, dude,
shouldn't you be like near the red phone?

692
00:43:14,301 --> 00:43:17,240
What is the red phone rings?
And you're on there, you know,

693
00:43:17,241 --> 00:43:19,700
picking your fucking
march madness brackets.

694
00:43:21,230 --> 00:43:26,230
It's unreal how the presidency of has
just gone downhill just over the last

695
00:43:26,631 --> 00:43:27,680
fucking 10 years.

696
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:31,580
Like right around 10 years ago was when
Bill Clinton got impeached because of

697
00:43:31,581 --> 00:43:35,540
some fucking Skank,
you know,

698
00:43:36,620 --> 00:43:38,800
every president.
Can you,

699
00:43:39,230 --> 00:43:44,230
can you even begin to understand not only
the amount of world leaders that have

700
00:43:45,981 --> 00:43:49,370
been in the Oval Office,
but the amount of fucking skanks

701
00:43:50,930 --> 00:43:54,920
that have been in there that does the
original playboy mansion. All right,

702
00:43:55,220 --> 00:43:57,890
guys have been in there getting blown

703
00:43:59,850 --> 00:44:01,070
fo for centuries.

704
00:44:02,690 --> 00:44:06,590
Women love power guys love blow jobs.
Okay?

705
00:44:06,650 --> 00:44:08,060
And when you marry the two,

706
00:44:08,090 --> 00:44:12,230
you get the fucking Oval Office
that is ground zero for that shit.

707
00:44:12,230 --> 00:44:15,170
And the guy got fucking impeached for it.
It's right there.

708
00:44:15,171 --> 00:44:19,220
I thought that knocked down in the
presidency that the president with fucking

709
00:44:19,221 --> 00:44:23,360
secret service at his fingertips
can't get a fucking blow job. Right?

710
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:28,200
He gets busted. And then you
had a, what's his face, uh,

711
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:33,390
uh, Georgie part to whose dad evidently
didn't teach them how to give a speech.

712
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:37,980
So we had to look at that fucking
retard for the last eight years,

713
00:44:39,030 --> 00:44:42,390
given a speech where he sounds like
somebody's given a book report who didn't

714
00:44:42,391 --> 00:44:44,280
read the book.
You know what I mean?

715
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:48,290
Kind of fucking looking around like he
had that shit and now we got this fuck

716
00:44:48,291 --> 00:44:52,200
head going on the tonight show.
Yeah.

717
00:44:52,950 --> 00:44:57,810
Like he's Ashton Kutcher. I
don't know. I don't like it.

718
00:44:58,170 --> 00:45:01,950
This is three, three presidents in a row
where I, I don't like what they're doing.

719
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:06,320
He wear the blue suit. You wear
the fucking tie and uh, you,

720
00:45:06,330 --> 00:45:08,520
you should have an air about you that you,

721
00:45:10,210 --> 00:45:12,030
and he just shouldn't be on the
tonight show. You know what I mean?

722
00:45:13,430 --> 00:45:17,940
So then this night show Perez Hilton,
Ashton Kutcher it,

723
00:45:17,941 --> 00:45:21,180
President Obama. You know
what? I didn't even watch it.

724
00:45:21,181 --> 00:45:24,600
I'm like literally criticizing. I had
something I didn't even watch. You know,

725
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:27,580
I just couldn't sit there
and watch that showing.

726
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:33,190
[inaudible] did you get through and the
president [inaudible] Hani, Hani, Hani,

727
00:45:33,270 --> 00:45:36,130
Hani, he's doing donuts.
We do it very notes.

728
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:42,420
Um, I don't know. All right, let's,
let's get on. What the fuck? I'm really,

729
00:45:42,450 --> 00:45:45,460
really in an extra fucking
shit mood right now. You know,

730
00:45:45,490 --> 00:45:48,430
it all started last night when I
yelled at that coyote, you know,

731
00:45:48,730 --> 00:45:52,250
that's what I did. I turned my
back on nature and actually kind,

732
00:45:52,390 --> 00:45:56,590
Kinda freaked me out cause it was
just a couple of blocks down my, uh,

733
00:45:57,500 --> 00:45:59,460
oh my street. You know what I
mean? It's like kill a sudden.

734
00:45:59,550 --> 00:46:03,970
It's like a fucking will
Smith movie playing out at
three in the morning. And uh,

735
00:46:03,971 --> 00:46:06,070
I was kinda wondering like where
the fuck that thing came from?

736
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:10,120
I know the Hollywood hills, that kind
of off there in the distance, but uh,

737
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:15,580
you know what a coyote eat road runners,
huh?

738
00:46:15,670 --> 00:46:19,930
Who watches cartoons? I do,
but they never catch them.

739
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:22,660
What does that even fucking true?

740
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:30,310
You know what I mean? Roadrunners can
fly, right? They just choose not to.

741
00:46:30,311 --> 00:46:33,880
They'd rent a room. They'd rather
run, be the fucking martyr.

742
00:46:34,630 --> 00:46:37,930
Make all the other birds feel guilty
for taking the easy way up. All right,

743
00:46:37,931 --> 00:46:41,530
let's get on with the
questions here because this
podcast is in a culdesac right

744
00:46:41,531 --> 00:46:43,120
now.
I have driven down the street.

745
00:46:43,180 --> 00:46:47,020
It says not a through way and I continued
down the fucking street and now I'm

746
00:46:47,021 --> 00:46:50,500
just driving around in a
fucking circle. Okay. Uh, Bill.

747
00:46:52,050 --> 00:46:55,900
All right. They're listening to your
podcast since I watched you perform.

748
00:46:56,350 --> 00:47:01,000
And because it's nice to hear someone
use the word count every five minutes.

749
00:47:01,001 --> 00:47:02,740
You know, a lot of people have
been giving me shit about that.

750
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:05,290
Say I used the word count too much
and that they're starting to use it in

751
00:47:05,291 --> 00:47:08,920
everyday life and their uh,
you know,

752
00:47:09,890 --> 00:47:13,330
they're dropping it and weird
times. All right. I'm sorry.

753
00:47:13,331 --> 00:47:16,960
I'm going to try to take, I'm going to
try not to use the word cunt so much.

754
00:47:17,050 --> 00:47:21,190
All right. You can't. Hey, he
did a cunt joke. All right.

755
00:47:21,370 --> 00:47:24,490
In addition is the rest of the
rest of the question about, um,

756
00:47:24,550 --> 00:47:26,410
how do you feel about non Irish,

757
00:47:27,330 --> 00:47:32,020
the way non Irish People Saint
Patrick's Day? Quite frankly,

758
00:47:32,050 --> 00:47:36,790
it pisses me off. It's a day to
celebrate the patron saint of Ireland,

759
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:40,150
not to get drunk.
I'm from Cleveland,

760
00:47:40,151 --> 00:47:45,010
Ohio and here we have a big
parade downtown. It's so
annoying seeing the drunks,

761
00:47:45,011 --> 00:47:46,030
filling the streets.

762
00:47:46,510 --> 00:47:50,890
People stereotype us as if we're
the only culture that has a drink.

763
00:47:50,891 --> 00:47:51,724
Once in awhile.

764
00:47:52,180 --> 00:47:56,200
I'm Irish American and I'm probably
the only woman of Irish descent who has

765
00:47:56,201 --> 00:47:58,690
never been drunk.
Really.

766
00:48:01,630 --> 00:48:06,430
My family and I usually have a traditional
meal of boiled potatoes, carrots,

767
00:48:06,670 --> 00:48:11,410
cabbage, corn, beef and Irish soda.
Bread. Now, let me tell you something.

768
00:48:11,411 --> 00:48:13,870
If ever there was a fucking
reason to get drunk,

769
00:48:15,970 --> 00:48:20,320
it's the kill, the taste,
boiled potatoes, carrots,

770
00:48:20,350 --> 00:48:21,610
cabbage, corn, beef.

771
00:48:21,611 --> 00:48:26,611
And you can just taste the hot water on
the fucking over boiled vegetables on.

772
00:48:30,190 --> 00:48:32,170
Every nutrient is just taken out of them.

773
00:48:32,171 --> 00:48:37,171
You wonder why as Irish people have such
pasty fucking skin and no pigment of

774
00:48:37,630 --> 00:48:42,420
the boil on the fucking nutrition out
of the, out of the vegetables anyways.

775
00:48:42,430 --> 00:48:45,610
Personally, she says, I think
traditional Irish food sucks.

776
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:49,570
And it's mostly because they didn't
cultivate much except for potatoes and

777
00:48:49,571 --> 00:48:53,860
cabbage. Well, you ever think maybe they
were too fucking drunk to get a cookbook,

778
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:58,210
you know,
but I do like Irish soda bread.

779
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:01,000
I remember you saying you
don't go out drinking. I don't,

780
00:49:01,001 --> 00:49:05,170
I don't think I ever said that.
Is that a Typo? Um, but you,

781
00:49:05,171 --> 00:49:09,580
but do you ever do anything?
And do you like Irish foods?

782
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:15,250
Um, I gotta admit I really do like a corn
beef sandwich and I really do like the

783
00:49:15,700 --> 00:49:17,500
[inaudible].
I do not like boiled potatoes.

784
00:49:17,501 --> 00:49:21,130
Boiled potatoes are disgusting and you
need at least half a stick of butter,

785
00:49:21,460 --> 00:49:26,460
salt and pepper to just kill
the taste of what you did to it.

786
00:49:27,550 --> 00:49:28,383
You know what I mean?

787
00:49:29,710 --> 00:49:32,800
I'm trying to think of anything that you
should boil other than drinking water

788
00:49:32,860 --> 00:49:36,430
during a fucking catastrophe.
You know,

789
00:49:36,431 --> 00:49:41,320
what do you boil rice?
All right then what you boil.

790
00:49:41,890 --> 00:49:45,010
I Dunno, but let me get back to the
question. How do I feel about people, uh,

791
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:48,990
who celebrate same faxing. I don't go
out on Saint Patrick's Day. That's a, a,

792
00:49:48,991 --> 00:49:52,110
it's a very bad day to go drinking.
You know,

793
00:49:52,150 --> 00:49:56,930
everybody out in their green plastic hats
and they'd say, Hey, can he navigate or,

794
00:49:57,080 --> 00:50:01,320
and long neck goose.
Yeah. It's, it's very, um,

795
00:50:03,550 --> 00:50:06,550
uh, it's, you know, it's like
drinking on New Year's Eve, you know,

796
00:50:06,730 --> 00:50:11,500
and all the dumb conser out with their
stupid little Corey outfits and is,

797
00:50:11,501 --> 00:50:14,620
if the sound of the noise makers
weren't ear piercing enough,

798
00:50:15,020 --> 00:50:19,630
you got them shrieking over them. It's
just a horrible time to go out. And,

799
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:21,610
um,
I still have inserted the question,

800
00:50:21,611 --> 00:50:25,840
how do I feel about non Irish people
celebrating Saint Patrick's Day?

801
00:50:27,170 --> 00:50:31,740
I really could give a shit. I
think it's a statement of, uh,

802
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:36,410
I dunno how empty their lives are or how
the herd just follows whatever the fuck

803
00:50:36,490 --> 00:50:38,990
they supposed to do.
You know,

804
00:50:40,910 --> 00:50:43,430
there's always like that one traditional
guy and he's got to weigh the Sculley

805
00:50:43,431 --> 00:50:46,580
cap in the Irish sweater,
standing over in the corner,

806
00:50:46,581 --> 00:50:51,410
cutting into a bar of soap with a
knife. You know that guy. Um, yeah,

807
00:50:51,411 --> 00:50:52,171
I could give a,
I'm a,

808
00:50:52,171 --> 00:50:57,110
I'm German Irish and I could give
a shit about a Saint Patrick's day.

809
00:50:57,350 --> 00:51:01,380
I don't know the story of
the patron saint and um,

810
00:51:02,420 --> 00:51:07,160
yeah, I don't give a fuck. I think in
the, in the, when I was in my twenties,

811
00:51:07,161 --> 00:51:11,720
I used to go out to pubs
on Saint Patrick's Day. Um,

812
00:51:12,410 --> 00:51:15,770
and I used to do it because
I would thought I could
get laid that night because

813
00:51:15,771 --> 00:51:18,980
I look so Irish. And then
some girl did like, oh my God,

814
00:51:19,010 --> 00:51:22,880
this is what the day is about.
Here's a Leprechaun right here.

815
00:51:23,420 --> 00:51:25,660
Maybe I'll blow them.
That's the only reason why I went up.

816
00:51:26,070 --> 00:51:27,920
I was desperately trying
to be interesting,

817
00:51:30,830 --> 00:51:32,180
but now I just,
I don't go out.

818
00:51:32,181 --> 00:51:36,230
I don't go out on new years and I
don't go out on a St Patrick's Day.

819
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:41,390
I don't go out on flag day and he
sorta day Earth Day I stay home.

820
00:51:42,610 --> 00:51:45,680
But those, those are, those
are just douche bag days.

821
00:51:46,490 --> 00:51:50,110
And what you want to do is
whatever people are doing is you,

822
00:51:50,270 --> 00:51:53,690
you do it the next day,
like Valentine's Day,

823
00:51:53,990 --> 00:51:57,560
everyone brings their brought out
to go fucking whatever, right?

824
00:51:58,370 --> 00:52:00,050
You can't get a reservation anywhere.

825
00:52:00,051 --> 00:52:03,470
The fucking prices are jacked up
through the roof. This is what you'd do.

826
00:52:03,850 --> 00:52:06,500
You'd go out on the
15th that's what you do.

827
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:10,370
And you tell you woman that that's what
you're doing because you're gonna get a

828
00:52:10,371 --> 00:52:14,020
fucking table anyway you want. You're
not going to get raped on the charges.

829
00:52:14,030 --> 00:52:16,400
You probably actually to be able
to go to a better restaurant

830
00:52:18,050 --> 00:52:20,930
than you would have on the night of the
14th and that's a great like, you know,

831
00:52:20,931 --> 00:52:22,790
you know a Bronx tale,
the lock, the door test.

832
00:52:23,120 --> 00:52:25,400
That's a great way to see if
you're with the cool girl and on,

833
00:52:25,430 --> 00:52:28,820
if she'd let you take her out on the on
on the 15th because it really doesn't

834
00:52:28,821 --> 00:52:31,880
make a fucking difference,
does it? You know,

835
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:37,960
you're going to get to see if she is an
independent thinker or if she's fucking

836
00:52:38,691 --> 00:52:41,780
stuck in must see TV,
you know,

837
00:52:41,870 --> 00:52:45,320
and it's going to drag you to the Macy
Day fucking Thanksgiving parade one day.

838
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:49,880
Cause that's what you do.
Everybody else is doing it.

839
00:52:49,881 --> 00:52:52,550
We have to do it.
I need,

840
00:52:53,090 --> 00:52:55,910
it's not that I don't love you and we're
just going to get raped here on the

841
00:52:55,911 --> 00:52:56,750
price.
You know,

842
00:52:57,980 --> 00:53:02,720
you're trying to find a
bargain on Valentine's Day.

843
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:07,190
Uh, I'm going to be rude bitch.
But you're in the relationship too.

844
00:53:07,220 --> 00:53:10,970
You're not paying for the fucking
meal. How does that work? Exactly.

845
00:53:11,930 --> 00:53:16,520
Exactly. You know what? Now I'm not even
taking you out. We'll go ahead and cry.

846
00:53:16,580 --> 00:53:17,780
Go ahead and cry.
It's not going to work.

847
00:53:17,781 --> 00:53:22,100
This is all fucking fake because you know,
I just exposed you for being selfish.

848
00:53:22,130 --> 00:53:24,840
I ain't like that. No, that
was great. You liked that.

849
00:53:24,870 --> 00:53:26,970
You liked that little little
riff I did there. I always,

850
00:53:27,180 --> 00:53:31,980
when the hypothetical arguments.
Um, okay. Bill, how would,

851
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:32,220
uh,

852
00:53:32,220 --> 00:53:37,220
how would I go about getting
a personalized autographed
DVD set from you DVD

853
00:53:38,550 --> 00:53:40,920
sets? I don't know where they
were releasing them in a set.

854
00:53:41,130 --> 00:53:46,020
Do I have a trilogy of Dvds
like the Godfather? Um,

855
00:53:46,110 --> 00:53:49,200
how would you go about that? Uh,
you'd come out to one of my shows,

856
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:51,450
that's what you would
do and you'd buy one.

857
00:53:51,451 --> 00:53:53,670
And I'd stand there and I'd
fucking sign it for you.

858
00:53:53,850 --> 00:53:56,400
And I'd smile like a jackass is,

859
00:53:56,401 --> 00:54:00,240
I waited the excruciating eight seconds
that it takes for a digital camera to

860
00:54:00,241 --> 00:54:03,070
click before the three flash bulbs go.

861
00:54:05,170 --> 00:54:08,610
Some of those disposable cameras,
as bad as they were for the environment,

862
00:54:08,611 --> 00:54:13,530
I imagine how great with those things,
say cheese click and it was over.

863
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:17,580
Now they fucking got those digital
cameras. They're like, hey,

864
00:54:18,060 --> 00:54:22,320
lan to today and then just sit in there
waiting and waiting with that fucking

865
00:54:22,321 --> 00:54:24,960
smile plastered on your face.
You know,

866
00:54:25,140 --> 00:54:28,860
like that fucking newscaster who goes to
throw it to the other newscaster in the

867
00:54:28,861 --> 00:54:30,720
field and then it doesn't go.

868
00:54:30,721 --> 00:54:34,710
And then you just staring at the entire
state that you're broadcasting to now

869
00:54:34,711 --> 00:54:37,020
off to Mike,
out in Chelmsford.

870
00:54:42,540 --> 00:54:45,480
Okay. Will seem to be having
some technical difficulty.

871
00:54:45,750 --> 00:54:50,070
That's what it's like getting your picture
taken on a fucking digital camera and

872
00:54:50,110 --> 00:54:52,590
you want to even better is when they
accidentally hit video and then you're

873
00:54:52,591 --> 00:54:54,390
standing there with a smile on your face.
Like

874
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:59,710
you start talking through your
taste as a god. All the Latin Dad,

875
00:54:59,840 --> 00:55:02,780
you gotta hold it down.
You know,

876
00:55:02,790 --> 00:55:05,430
many times that's happened to me after
my shows and they're like, oh my God,

877
00:55:05,431 --> 00:55:06,450
I had it on video.

878
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:13,880
And those are the times when I wish I
didn't sell shit at the end of my shows.

879
00:55:15,870 --> 00:55:19,140
You know, I like meeting people after
my shows. I definitely like doing that.

880
00:55:19,141 --> 00:55:22,500
But you know, sometimes you feel
like a fucking idiot, you know,

881
00:55:22,501 --> 00:55:24,570
especially when people come up to
you on like, you know, there's,

882
00:55:24,860 --> 00:55:29,670
there's this joke, can you just say pesto
and then we'll take the picture now.

883
00:55:29,730 --> 00:55:33,600
Now I can. Oh my God, you so
grumpy. Shut up. Take the picture.

884
00:55:35,470 --> 00:55:40,290
Um, all right. Anyways,
uh, he said I didn't want,

885
00:55:40,330 --> 00:55:41,131
let me go on with this guy.

886
00:55:41,131 --> 00:55:45,330
He says I'm happy to pay for it and I
have a downloaded copies paid for to my

887
00:55:45,331 --> 00:55:47,400
iPhone,
but I want an autograph one,

888
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:51,810
so let me know what I need to do to get
one where I had to pay for it. All right.

889
00:55:51,811 --> 00:55:56,430
I'm kind of being a Douche
here, but like, um, you know,

890
00:55:58,440 --> 00:56:01,080
people ask me for like
autographed photos and Shit.

891
00:56:01,081 --> 00:56:05,040
Like I'm Fonzie sometimes and they never,

892
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:09,540
they like expect me to pay the postage
and all that type of shit and it's just

893
00:56:09,541 --> 00:56:13,770
like, I'm not doing that. Okay. All right.
I, I hang out at the end of my shows.

894
00:56:13,771 --> 00:56:17,790
I take pictures, I autographed,
I do everything but kiss
fucking babies. All right.

895
00:56:17,791 --> 00:56:19,380
I do this podcast every week.

896
00:56:19,710 --> 00:56:22,530
I'm not going to get myself into this
situation where I got to go to the post

897
00:56:22,531 --> 00:56:27,370
office, you know, every fucking, you
know, every other day. All right.

898
00:56:27,371 --> 00:56:29,890
With Manila envelopes. I'm
not doing that Shit, you know,

899
00:56:30,820 --> 00:56:33,070
trying to think of something
to write before I sign.

900
00:56:33,120 --> 00:56:37,300
That's the hardest thing about giving an
autograph. Can you make it out to Susie?

901
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:40,450
And then I always write Susie and
then I signed my name and I'm like,

902
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:44,830
then I tried to think what the
right and I'm like, fuck uh,

903
00:56:44,860 --> 00:56:48,430
God bless a Susie.

904
00:56:49,630 --> 00:56:51,020
What's going on?
[inaudible]

905
00:56:55,140 --> 00:56:59,890
AH, Shit. All right. Who complains about
signing autographs? You know what I do.

906
00:57:00,430 --> 00:57:05,230
I do. Um, okay. Uh, okay,
let's go. Let's get on with it.

907
00:57:05,470 --> 00:57:09,160
I'm really sounding like a fucking
Weirdo. I get off complaining like, Oh,

908
00:57:09,170 --> 00:57:12,550
acted like I would see, someone asks
me for a photograph every other day.

909
00:57:12,910 --> 00:57:15,580
I was going to say every 20 minutes and
I'm like, they'll never believe that.

910
00:57:15,610 --> 00:57:17,740
I'll say every other day.
That's not even true.

911
00:57:17,770 --> 00:57:22,770
It's usually like once a month and it's
usually somebody with a fatal disease

912
00:57:23,230 --> 00:57:27,670
and I still don't send it to him because
that's the kind of guy I am. All right.

913
00:57:27,700 --> 00:57:29,440
Also, Bill, let me move on here.

914
00:57:31,390 --> 00:57:34,900
You should really promote the
broadcast. Okay, Bill, you should also,

915
00:57:34,901 --> 00:57:38,020
you should really promote the
podcast for download on iTunes.

916
00:57:38,530 --> 00:57:40,480
That shit is so easy that once you do it,

917
00:57:40,570 --> 00:57:44,170
you had the podcasts on your iPhone and
you can listen to it in the car anywhere

918
00:57:44,530 --> 00:57:47,800
other than in front of a computer.
Well, there you go. Everybody,

919
00:57:47,801 --> 00:57:52,570
you can download it on iTunes. Thank
you sir. You just hyped it for me.

920
00:57:52,900 --> 00:57:53,290
All right,

921
00:57:53,290 --> 00:57:57,580
last week I had a big question about
the difference between hotels and motels

922
00:57:58,870 --> 00:58:03,370
and uh, well first of all,
before I get into this shit,
um, how about those Bruins?

923
00:58:03,371 --> 00:58:05,290
Huh?
Beaten the New Jersey devils.

924
00:58:05,291 --> 00:58:09,070
I got any New Jersey Devil fans out
that you like that little four to one

925
00:58:09,071 --> 00:58:12,190
victory.
I'm just fucking with you.

926
00:58:12,191 --> 00:58:15,940
You guys got a great team and if
you're not watching hockey right now,

927
00:58:15,941 --> 00:58:20,941
I really feel bad for you all you
guys watching March madness and uh,

928
00:58:21,161 --> 00:58:22,300
you know,
waiting for that,

929
00:58:22,330 --> 00:58:26,020
that awful song at the end
of the tournament when they
show the great moments,

930
00:58:27,220 --> 00:58:29,360
I had a dream.

931
00:58:29,930 --> 00:58:34,930
They usually pick up Lincoln was syrupy
song as they show all the dunks in slow

932
00:58:35,051 --> 00:58:38,200
motion and the people being
excited and then crying.

933
00:58:38,950 --> 00:58:42,850
What is this song that they sing tonight?
I need you.

934
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:47,680
Oh,
[inaudible]

935
00:58:52,750 --> 00:58:57,280
Tony Right now it playoff hockey is
coming. The flyers of playing great.

936
00:58:57,580 --> 00:58:58,900
The range is lost yesterday,

937
00:58:58,901 --> 00:59:01,480
but they're coming on the
capitols of fucking ridiculous.

938
00:59:01,900 --> 00:59:06,730
The goddamn Devil's got an insane
team as always. I really hate,

939
00:59:06,790 --> 00:59:10,480
I really hate the devils.
I just hate their, uh,

940
00:59:11,750 --> 00:59:15,400
I hate that the country style of hockey
that they played throughout the 90s with

941
00:59:15,401 --> 00:59:19,690
the left wing lock in the trap defense.
I swear to God, not disrespecting,

942
00:59:20,050 --> 00:59:23,660
you know, Marty her over there and the
big records that he got, but you know,

943
00:59:23,810 --> 00:59:24,920
it's a little padded.

944
00:59:26,180 --> 00:59:30,740
It's a little fucking pattern
with the fucking trap defense.

945
00:59:30,741 --> 00:59:33,090
I mean he spent half
his career have to save.

946
00:59:33,110 --> 00:59:35,270
He made with skating behind his neck,

947
00:59:36,100 --> 00:59:39,680
stopping the puck because they just
would dump it in because they clog up the

948
00:59:39,681 --> 00:59:41,600
neutral zone and you know what I mean?

949
00:59:41,630 --> 00:59:45,530
And that was also during the clutch
and grab era. Jesus Christ. I could've,

950
00:59:45,560 --> 00:59:50,420
I could've squeezed out a couple of shout
outs. All right, that's bullshit. I just,

951
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:53,960
I just hated that period of hockey. And
when I think about that period of hockey,

952
00:59:53,961 --> 00:59:57,620
I think about the New Jersey devils
and I don't still to this day,

953
00:59:57,621 --> 01:00:01,310
I don't understand why the NHL just
didn't say that's an illegal defense.

954
01:00:01,730 --> 01:00:02,563
You know what I mean?

955
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:07,520
It's like when will Chamberlain was
fucking dunking on everybody. You know,

956
01:00:07,940 --> 01:00:09,920
they came up with rules to,

957
01:00:10,080 --> 01:00:14,990
to keep it competitive because
it's a fucking business. You know,

958
01:00:15,470 --> 01:00:16,520
the three second rule,

959
01:00:16,521 --> 01:00:20,480
you can't have some guy just standing in
the fucking paint who's nine feet tall.

960
01:00:21,080 --> 01:00:25,250
Goaltending they came up with that shit
and they came up with the legal defenses

961
01:00:25,250 --> 01:00:28,310
. I still don't know why
they allow that defense.

962
01:00:28,311 --> 01:00:31,100
It's the worst fuck they had to get rid
of. The red line because of that shit.

963
01:00:32,870 --> 01:00:35,690
I don't know, but I was watching
yesterday and they don't play it anymore,

964
01:00:35,691 --> 01:00:37,190
so I really enjoyed it.
But as usual,

965
01:00:37,191 --> 01:00:40,520
they just got great fucking players
and they play smart fucking hockey.

966
01:00:41,360 --> 01:00:45,890
And uh, I dunno. I Dunno what's
gonna be a tough fucking road.

967
01:00:46,340 --> 01:00:48,770
And uh, for those of you who
are, who don't want to know,

968
01:00:48,771 --> 01:00:51,530
this is a question I have for you little
fuck are these people who are trying to

969
01:00:51,531 --> 01:00:54,980
get the fighting out of hockey? I
don't understand them. You know,

970
01:00:55,340 --> 01:00:58,680
watch a different sport. Hockey
is not for you. All right?

971
01:01:00,710 --> 01:01:02,960
And if it's somebody in
hockey stopped doing it,

972
01:01:03,530 --> 01:01:05,480
don't get rid of fighting and hockey.
All right?

973
01:01:05,481 --> 01:01:08,900
And think that you're going
to be as popular as baseball,
basketball or football.

974
01:01:08,901 --> 01:01:11,840
You're not all right.
You're a rogue fucking sport.

975
01:01:13,530 --> 01:01:15,410
You don't really is hard about
hockey's if you never grew,

976
01:01:15,411 --> 01:01:19,340
if you didn't grow up playing it or in
like a hockey family or in a hockey town,

977
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:23,630
it's one of the hardest
fucking game to watch on TV.

978
01:01:25,370 --> 01:01:26,900
I was kind of noticing that yesterday.

979
01:01:26,901 --> 01:01:30,440
Like you literally have to be not
only watching what's on the screen,

980
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:34,640
but what is like literally 20
feet to the left of your screen.

981
01:01:35,960 --> 01:01:36,850
You know what I mean?
You've got to,

982
01:01:37,120 --> 01:01:39,710
you've got to figure out like
a guests when they're like,

983
01:01:39,740 --> 01:01:41,420
you can after a while
you watch it long enough.

984
01:01:41,660 --> 01:01:45,830
You know what's going on to the
left or to the right of the play.

985
01:01:45,831 --> 01:01:49,400
That is literally off the
TV screen. You just, Oh,

986
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:51,960
the change in lines like you
just know shit like that.

987
01:01:54,680 --> 01:01:59,480
I can't see the puck. Well fucking
watch bowling. You blind bastard.

988
01:01:59,840 --> 01:02:02,240
All right. It was a question I
had last week. Someone I asked,

989
01:02:02,241 --> 01:02:04,730
what's the difference between a hotel
in a motel? You know what I mean?

990
01:02:04,820 --> 01:02:07,100
And I thought it was basically,
you know,

991
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:11,330
if your door opens up out to the
parking lot, that is a fucking motel.

992
01:02:12,110 --> 01:02:13,130
It's a serial killer.

993
01:02:13,370 --> 01:02:17,120
Doesn't have to kill somebody at a front
desk and get in an elevator or at least

994
01:02:17,300 --> 01:02:20,460
walk a hundred yards of
carpet before he kills you.

995
01:02:20,490 --> 01:02:22,980
That is a hotel now that is a motel.

996
01:02:23,010 --> 01:02:27,300
I'm sorry if he has to do that shit that
is a hotel and evidently I am right.

997
01:02:27,301 --> 01:02:30,150
Because one person said that I was,

998
01:02:30,270 --> 01:02:33,530
and that's the amount of research that
I do with everything in my life. Bell,

999
01:02:33,540 --> 01:02:35,230
if you drive up to your room,
uh,

1000
01:02:35,250 --> 01:02:39,990
you are at a motel and use as you deserve
to hear the people fucking next to

1001
01:02:39,991 --> 01:02:44,160
you. Oh wait, I read that wrong because
I have dyslexia. Let me start over again.

1002
01:02:44,610 --> 01:02:47,820
Take a deep breath focused.
You can do this bill.

1003
01:02:48,510 --> 01:02:49,860
If you drive up to your room,

1004
01:02:50,450 --> 01:02:55,450
you are at a motel and you deserve to
hear the fucking people next to you talk

1005
01:02:56,761 --> 01:03:01,020
about their free fucking Hbo. Okay. That
was really funny and I butchered it.

1006
01:03:02,820 --> 01:03:07,470
Um, anyways, he goes,
uh, that shit sucks also.

1007
01:03:07,471 --> 01:03:11,580
You're killing me. You're fucking killing
me. You spent $89 on a cheap motel.

1008
01:03:11,790 --> 01:03:16,020
Are you fucking nuts? I always hear about
this internet stuff and I never do it.

1009
01:03:16,440 --> 01:03:20,760
And he writes in capital letters.
Then he goes back to regular typing.

1010
01:03:20,940 --> 01:03:23,160
Listen to me,
go to Priceline.

1011
01:03:23,161 --> 01:03:27,600
Next time you're traveling and look up
a hotel and pick the highest star rating

1012
01:03:27,601 --> 01:03:32,601
and do not bid any more than 89 bucks and
you'll get the best hotel in this city

1013
01:03:33,061 --> 01:03:33,990
for that price.

1014
01:03:35,430 --> 01:03:39,540
I would tell you to go
down to 59 or 69 bucks,

1015
01:03:39,541 --> 01:03:42,840
but just stick with 89 bucks.
Please just try it once.

1016
01:03:42,841 --> 01:03:46,830
I travel the road for 14 years and I
kicked myself in the ass when I realized

1017
01:03:46,831 --> 01:03:47,970
what I'd been missing out on.

1018
01:03:48,570 --> 01:03:52,470
Thanks for the free podcast are the
highlight of my Monday mornings. Well,

1019
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:57,090
thanks for the fucking Info.
That's that William Shatner. Shit.

1020
01:03:58,350 --> 01:04:00,540
I never even,
I don't even pay attention to commercials.

1021
01:04:00,541 --> 01:04:04,740
I just look at the fucking,
the glitzy lights. I'm like,
oh wow. Look at, well shit.

1022
01:04:04,770 --> 01:04:06,600
William Shatner, you know,
he's keeping it going.

1023
01:04:07,320 --> 01:04:11,940
I did star trek 40 fucking years ago
and he's still working, you know,

1024
01:04:13,800 --> 01:04:18,060
um, and he has a hell of it to pay.
All right, ask bill. Here we go.

1025
01:04:18,330 --> 01:04:22,230
Here's the gas bill. A section of the
podcast that I just started there.

1026
01:04:22,320 --> 01:04:25,710
I was all right. Ask Bill.
Bill. I need your advice.

1027
01:04:25,770 --> 01:04:30,300
I had something very horrible happened
to me and Oh man, this is brutal.

1028
01:04:31,080 --> 01:04:35,640
Settle into your fucking, you're a
staples office chair for this one.

1029
01:04:35,641 --> 01:04:38,970
People. This is, this is a
tough situation. All right,

1030
01:04:39,190 --> 01:04:43,620
and I don't know if I get the uh, life
experience to get you out of this one.

1031
01:04:44,520 --> 01:04:48,450
Um, as bill. Okay, Bill, I need
your advice. I had something very,

1032
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:52,320
very horrible happen to me and
it's nobody's fault but mine.

1033
01:04:53,550 --> 01:04:57,720
Nobody's fault but mine, Ben in and Nnn,
sorry, led Zepplin. All right, have this,

1034
01:04:57,780 --> 01:05:02,370
I have this friend who don't
get me wrong, is a good friend,

1035
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:07,400
but is that one type of
friend who's really fucking
annoying but wanting to hang

1036
01:05:08,701 --> 01:05:09,990
out 24,
seven.

1037
01:05:11,070 --> 01:05:15,990
Just recently I got a new girlfriend
and I've been spending all my time with

1038
01:05:15,991 --> 01:05:19,210
her.
My friend Ben became jealous,

1039
01:05:19,330 --> 01:05:22,990
becoming more and more annoying by making
me feel bad for being with my girl.

1040
01:05:23,320 --> 01:05:25,780
Anyway,
long story short to vent,

1041
01:05:26,020 --> 01:05:31,020
I wrote an email to my girl just trashing
my friend up and down the fucking road

1042
01:05:32,290 --> 01:05:36,100
for being the moron.
Wait a minute.

1043
01:05:36,490 --> 01:05:38,650
Could you use a smaller type set?
You know,

1044
01:05:38,651 --> 01:05:43,540
I suck at reading a book,
Isaac trashing my friend up and down,

1045
01:05:43,541 --> 01:05:46,540
but being the moron that I am,
and here we go,

1046
01:05:46,541 --> 01:05:50,710
people instead of just sending it,
emailing it to her,

1047
01:05:51,220 --> 01:05:53,440
I checked the send all options,

1048
01:05:53,441 --> 01:05:57,070
sending this horrendous email
to everyone on my email list.

1049
01:05:58,030 --> 01:06:02,620
Oops. My email list doesn't
really have too many people on it,

1050
01:06:02,621 --> 01:06:07,350
but it does have the friend I was
trashing. Of course, it just made,

1051
01:06:07,351 --> 01:06:10,630
it just made me realize that you shouldn't
say things behind someone's back if

1052
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:11,950
he can't say it to their face.

1053
01:06:12,220 --> 01:06:15,550
So I'm nominating myself for
Douche bag of the week. Lol.

1054
01:06:15,850 --> 01:06:20,110
What would be your advice?
Send an apology email or just ignore them.

1055
01:06:22,630 --> 01:06:26,650
Uh, that's the worst. That's the worst.

1056
01:06:26,770 --> 01:06:30,520
Because you know what
sucks about that is you,

1057
01:06:31,030 --> 01:06:36,030
you're 100% in the right that
this guy is a douche bag,

1058
01:06:36,100 --> 01:06:40,090
but now you became the
Douche bag because a,

1059
01:06:40,091 --> 01:06:42,940
and you know what's funny
is if he had a girlfriend,

1060
01:06:43,750 --> 01:06:47,530
he would be doing the same thing.
He just wouldn't have been a

1061
01:06:49,300 --> 01:06:54,130
dumb enough to fucking send,
hit send to everyone.

1062
01:06:54,760 --> 01:06:59,230
Uh, I dunno. What should you do?
Should you send an apology email? No.

1063
01:06:59,260 --> 01:07:03,790
First of all, stop writing things
down on paper. That's number one.

1064
01:07:03,850 --> 01:07:07,990
Don't ever do that. And number two, learn
how to spell apology. There was no e

1065
01:07:12,160 --> 01:07:15,910
I wouldn't just ignore him.
You gotta take it like a man.

1066
01:07:15,911 --> 01:07:18,340
You just got to walk up to him
and just be like, yeah, you know,

1067
01:07:19,150 --> 01:07:24,150
I wrote it and you know what I meant that
you've been a con and a and that's it.

1068
01:07:25,270 --> 01:07:28,900
So you want to punch me in
the face knowing that I'm
going to defend myself and

1069
01:07:29,170 --> 01:07:32,650
punch you too. So you know, that's kind
of where we're at. I know it sucks.

1070
01:07:34,030 --> 01:07:36,040
I don't know. You know what I think, uh,

1071
01:07:38,020 --> 01:07:41,260
I'm getting uncomfortable thinking
about the situation you put yourself in.

1072
01:07:41,261 --> 01:07:45,520
I really don't know what to tell you. I
don't know what to do with that one. Uh,

1073
01:07:45,521 --> 01:07:48,820
you got caught and you're fucking,
you kind of turned yourself in.

1074
01:07:49,870 --> 01:07:54,830
You should be on America's dumbest
Shit Talkers Llc.

1075
01:07:55,020 --> 01:07:55,990
You know, you know that show, right?

1076
01:07:55,991 --> 01:07:58,570
America's dumbest criminals and the
guy's put whipped cream on their face and

1077
01:07:58,571 --> 01:08:01,990
they stand in line at the bank and it
melts off their face by the time they get

1078
01:08:01,991 --> 01:08:04,150
up. This is what this guy, he
did the email equivalent of that.

1079
01:08:04,510 --> 01:08:08,920
I don't know what you got to do.
I would just,

1080
01:08:08,950 --> 01:08:13,270
I the laugh, I have no idea. You know
what? I got no advice on this one. I got,

1081
01:08:13,271 --> 01:08:16,670
I got, I gotta spell this
to the listeners. All right.
I gotta go to way, uh,

1082
01:08:17,780 --> 01:08:20,240
what do they say that you got
to, I got a phone, a friend here.

1083
01:08:20,330 --> 01:08:25,100
If anybody has any advices what to, what
the fuck this guy supposed to do? Um,

1084
01:08:25,101 --> 01:08:28,490
I'll read it next week because I don't
know what to do. You've, you've, uh,

1085
01:08:28,610 --> 01:08:33,230
it's checkmate. Checkmate.
Uh, I dunno what to do.

1086
01:08:34,370 --> 01:08:38,030
Dump your girlfriend, change your
name and moved to Alaska. Um,

1087
01:08:38,060 --> 01:08:41,780
either that or he had just, uh,
I think you just got to take it.

1088
01:08:42,650 --> 01:08:45,680
I think you just got to take it.
All right. So what did you learn?

1089
01:08:45,830 --> 01:08:47,280
No more fucking emails.
Right?

1090
01:08:48,790 --> 01:08:51,170
And you've got to watch out too cause
you'll vent to you fucking girlfriends.

1091
01:08:51,170 --> 01:08:52,790
And even,
even when she's in a good mood,

1092
01:08:53,230 --> 01:08:56,220
she's still going to tell
half the fucking story to uh,

1093
01:08:57,830 --> 01:09:02,600
to one of her close friends. You know
what I mean? I Dunno why they just stay.

1094
01:09:02,780 --> 01:09:06,780
They really, um, I don't really
think women oh bad to keeping it.

1095
01:09:06,950 --> 01:09:09,950
He didn't guys are overrated,
but their ability to keep a secret.

1096
01:09:10,130 --> 01:09:14,780
I'm going to keep it a secret
because I forget shit cause I'm,

1097
01:09:14,781 --> 01:09:16,940
I have any sort of code. I just, you know,

1098
01:09:17,450 --> 01:09:20,360
I have really bad memory and after
like three days, I can't remember.

1099
01:09:21,290 --> 01:09:22,940
Like you could literally be like,
Bill,

1100
01:09:23,420 --> 01:09:27,920
anyone don't say anything but I fucked
so and so's wife. I feel like shit,

1101
01:09:28,400 --> 01:09:32,030
I can't believe it. I have so much
guilt. I just had to tell somebody,

1102
01:09:32,540 --> 01:09:36,200
please don't tell anybody. And I'd be
like, yeah, okay. Yeah Dude, no problem.

1103
01:09:36,260 --> 01:09:39,290
No problem. And literally, I'm
not saying two, three days later,

1104
01:09:39,291 --> 01:09:42,440
but by a year and a half,

1105
01:09:43,070 --> 01:09:45,470
if I went out to dinner with
all the people involved,

1106
01:09:46,580 --> 01:09:51,080
maybe sometime around dessert, I
would be like, oh, wait a minute.

1107
01:09:51,110 --> 01:09:54,560
Wait a minute. He fucked that
guy is who I am. That's right.

1108
01:09:56,720 --> 01:10:00,260
That's right. So it's not like
I can keep a secret. I just,

1109
01:10:00,320 --> 01:10:02,490
I can't fucking remember. Yeah,
though. We got it. We got it.

1110
01:10:02,491 --> 01:10:04,970
And then we understood what the example,
you don't need to go back into it.

1111
01:10:05,030 --> 01:10:07,520
Why don't you wrap up the fucking podcast?
All right.

1112
01:10:07,670 --> 01:10:11,270
You're 40 fucking minutes
in. I right. Relax.

1113
01:10:11,900 --> 01:10:14,930
There's gonna be a long podcast, but
I don't get going here. Um, all right,

1114
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:18,860
let's get onto revenge stories.
Okay. This is a question I have,

1115
01:10:18,861 --> 01:10:22,370
because every revenge story
seems to be from guys.

1116
01:10:22,920 --> 01:10:25,340
None of them seem to be from females.
So finally,

1117
01:10:25,341 --> 01:10:29,540
a woman chimed in with
some sort of revenge,

1118
01:10:29,541 --> 01:10:32,870
but it wasn't really revenge.
Um,

1119
01:10:34,250 --> 01:10:37,250
or maybe it was revenge and she was just
doing the typical thing that women do

1120
01:10:37,251 --> 01:10:41,180
when they tell stories as they never get
to the fucking point. No kidding. Oh,

1121
01:10:41,240 --> 01:10:44,960
Jesus. I'm crabby. Tell you. All right
here. Here's one from a hormone bill.

1122
01:10:44,961 --> 01:10:47,840
I usually don't take serious
revenge on someone, but I do take,

1123
01:10:48,260 --> 01:10:51,950
I take so much pleasure in other
persons fuck ups and misery.

1124
01:10:52,520 --> 01:10:57,520
I always take comfort finding out that
someone I hate has such a miserable life.

1125
01:10:57,920 --> 01:11:01,710
Here's a story about my egg head
Douche ex boyfriend. All right.

1126
01:11:01,760 --> 01:11:05,570
I already liked the sound of this. All
right. To start to start the story.

1127
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:10,190
I will admit that I was a con too.
Rarely. Rarely gave him any sexual,

1128
01:11:11,300 --> 01:11:14,520
anything sexual for two years.
Jesus Christ.

1129
01:11:14,521 --> 01:11:19,110
That's one of those relationship that
died the final two years and no one,

1130
01:11:19,111 --> 01:11:21,540
no one just had the nerve to be like,
hey,

1131
01:11:21,541 --> 01:11:25,920
so why don't we both just fuck off
anyways. Uh, she goes at least, uh,

1132
01:11:25,950 --> 01:11:27,660
he put up with,
with that shit.

1133
01:11:27,990 --> 01:11:32,990
Any other guy would probably want to do
stuff or get sick of it and dump my ass

1134
01:11:33,420 --> 01:11:34,253
anyway.

1135
01:11:34,590 --> 01:11:39,270
He always played a PC games
such as world of Warcraft.

1136
01:11:39,690 --> 01:11:44,690
He got so fucking gross in that game
and paying money every month to renew a

1137
01:11:45,001 --> 01:11:47,370
subscription. What a dumb ass, however,

1138
01:11:47,760 --> 01:11:51,910
plays can talk to other players in
their guilt or on their side of the,

1139
01:11:51,960 --> 01:11:54,510
of the game.
After I broke up with them,

1140
01:11:54,511 --> 01:11:58,170
I found out that he was talking to
some chick behind my back for a year.

1141
01:11:58,710 --> 01:12:02,550
The story gets better. Um, this is, uh,

1142
01:12:02,551 --> 01:12:06,870
this is where my revenge happens.
I don't have to do shit to ruin his life.

1143
01:12:06,900 --> 01:12:10,740
I didn't have to do shit to ruin his
life. Okay. So after I dump his ass,

1144
01:12:10,770 --> 01:12:14,550
he continues talking to the Conti
meant for them from the game.

1145
01:12:14,820 --> 01:12:18,390
He thinks he's in love with
her parentheses, retard.

1146
01:12:18,750 --> 01:12:22,020
So we goes to Canada to be
with her where she lives,

1147
01:12:22,380 --> 01:12:25,620
I guess he thought she was going
to be the one and he proposed,

1148
01:12:25,950 --> 01:12:30,750
but a month later he gets deported
back to America and like a dumb ass.

1149
01:12:30,930 --> 01:12:35,880
He lets her keep the $3,000 a ringer on
her finger. After a short period of time,

1150
01:12:36,060 --> 01:12:38,760
he tried to go back,
but he gets deported again.

1151
01:12:39,420 --> 01:12:44,070
So he's a college dropout who lives at
home with his mommy and he's out three

1152
01:12:44,071 --> 01:12:48,390
grand in addition,
while after he starts dating.

1153
01:12:49,200 --> 01:12:52,620
Oh, in addition a while after he
starts dating this Jewish bitch,

1154
01:12:53,250 --> 01:12:57,360
they were dating for about a year
and a half, one and a half years.

1155
01:12:57,390 --> 01:13:01,290
Then she dumps him because
she decides it doesn't,

1156
01:13:01,350 --> 01:13:03,390
it's not going to work
out cause he's Catholic.

1157
01:13:04,560 --> 01:13:09,390
And the icing on the cake is that all I
have to do to make them feel even more

1158
01:13:09,391 --> 01:13:13,140
pathetic is let them find out.
I Bang my boyfriend

1159
01:13:14,760 --> 01:13:19,290
and everything he does usually comes back
to me because he keeps in contact with

1160
01:13:19,291 --> 01:13:21,630
one of my good friends.
Anyway.

1161
01:13:22,230 --> 01:13:27,120
Anyone who is on my bedside who has fucked
with me has always had something come

1162
01:13:27,121 --> 01:13:28,560
back to bite them in the ass.

1163
01:13:29,070 --> 01:13:32,850
I take great pleasure
in that Jesus Christ.

1164
01:13:34,260 --> 01:13:39,090
Wow. That is a fucking,
yeah, Hell hath no fury.

1165
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:43,410
I love how you dumped him and you think
he's a loser and you're still getting

1166
01:13:43,411 --> 01:13:46,200
enjoyment that he has this horrific life.

1167
01:13:48,420 --> 01:13:52,500
That's scary, man. You know, I usually
expect that sort of evilness out of guys.

1168
01:13:53,400 --> 01:13:55,610
You know, and it's just really
frightening. Like that's,

1169
01:13:55,650 --> 01:13:58,880
that's a mom that's going
to be somebody's mom. No,

1170
01:13:59,220 --> 01:14:04,220
our wire hangers I believe is
another of story of revenge.

1171
01:14:05,910 --> 01:14:09,540
Um, you know what it was what that story
you can think of being a jerk to that

1172
01:14:09,541 --> 01:14:13,120
person. It's that the guy really
didn't do anything to you. You know,

1173
01:14:13,580 --> 01:14:15,970
he was a lame dude.
He was a loser.

1174
01:14:16,360 --> 01:14:20,800
You dumped him and then his life
continued to go down the toilet

1175
01:14:22,300 --> 01:14:26,220
and I don't know. And you're just enjoying
him getting dizzy as he goes down on,

1176
01:14:26,230 --> 01:14:29,530
I don't fucking get it. Anyways.
Um, anyways, here we go. Here we go.

1177
01:14:30,110 --> 01:14:30,943
Vent story number two.

1178
01:14:31,210 --> 01:14:34,330
About 20 years ago I was living
in downtown Chicago by the way.

1179
01:14:34,331 --> 01:14:39,250
This person is like, I know I read really
bad out loud, but this guy is typing,

1180
01:14:39,440 --> 01:14:44,350
eat, and even a smaller
type. I don't understand.

1181
01:14:44,380 --> 01:14:47,740
Can you guys type a little bit bigger
and don't be a con and just give me the

1182
01:14:47,741 --> 01:14:50,710
biggest size. Okay. That's really
a second grade joke. All right.

1183
01:14:50,890 --> 01:14:53,770
We're trying to do something serious here.
People do whatever you want.

1184
01:14:53,771 --> 01:14:57,460
I don't give a fuck. I'll sit here and
start it through the emails bill. Okay,

1185
01:14:57,520 --> 01:14:58,810
let me get out my magnifying glass.

1186
01:14:58,811 --> 01:15:02,890
About 20 years ago I was
living in downtown Chicago
and a high rise that had a

1187
01:15:02,891 --> 01:15:04,630
multilevel parking garage.

1188
01:15:04,900 --> 01:15:09,010
I paid a monthly fee and had
a designated covered spot.

1189
01:15:10,180 --> 01:15:12,280
Skye was doing great. It sounded
like you worked like one of those,

1190
01:15:12,281 --> 01:15:17,050
fuck oh 20 years ago. I think he was
selling health insurance. Um, anyways,

1191
01:15:17,051 --> 01:15:22,051
one night I came home to find another
car parked in my assigned spot and since

1192
01:15:22,091 --> 01:15:25,240
it was about 2:00 AM I just said fuck it,
you know,

1193
01:15:25,660 --> 01:15:29,530
and drove to the roof deck where there
was always plenty of open spaces.

1194
01:15:29,970 --> 01:15:34,970
At about 10:00 AM I was looking out the
window of my apartment and I saw a tow

1195
01:15:35,051 --> 01:15:39,010
truck driving down Lasalle Street
with my car attached to the back.

1196
01:15:39,700 --> 01:15:42,780
Since I was on the 18th floor, there
was no chance to catch the tow trucks.

1197
01:15:42,781 --> 01:15:47,230
So I went down to the office and ask the
manager management why my car was towed.

1198
01:15:47,560 --> 01:15:49,690
She said that I was parked
in someone else's spot.

1199
01:15:50,080 --> 01:15:54,250
I explained that someone was parked in
my spot and that there was probably 30

1200
01:15:54,251 --> 01:15:55,750
empty spots on the roof deck.

1201
01:15:55,960 --> 01:16:00,760
Plus the fact that my car had a sticker
on the windshield showed that I was a

1202
01:16:00,761 --> 01:16:04,350
resident. She said that there was
nothing she could do and I asked.

1203
01:16:04,351 --> 01:16:07,660
So I asked to speak to the
person who had my car towed.

1204
01:16:07,870 --> 01:16:11,170
She called the girl who had my car
towed and she came down to the office.

1205
01:16:11,440 --> 01:16:14,530
She was a total con about
the whole situation,

1206
01:16:14,600 --> 01:16:17,020
insisted that she did the right thing.
Well,

1207
01:16:17,021 --> 01:16:19,060
since I couldn't blast
this continent face,

1208
01:16:19,240 --> 01:16:23,770
I decided to take revenge on her car
since I knew exactly where she parked.

1209
01:16:24,070 --> 01:16:25,030
Once again,

1210
01:16:25,720 --> 01:16:29,740
revenge is coming back to fucking
up somebody's car. All right,

1211
01:16:30,640 --> 01:16:32,260
so here we go.
Here is their event.

1212
01:16:32,560 --> 01:16:37,560
I waited about two months and then I
got a syringe from my mother who was a

1213
01:16:37,781 --> 01:16:38,680
diabetic.

1214
01:16:42,520 --> 01:16:46,520
Did you make sure she had an extra one?
I hope he didn't take her last one. See,

1215
01:16:46,610 --> 01:16:49,840
see what happens when you go down the
road of revenge. Next thing you know,

1216
01:16:50,020 --> 01:16:52,960
you stealing syringes from your mom.
So anyways,

1217
01:16:52,961 --> 01:16:56,260
I still syringe from my
mom who's a diabetic. Uh,

1218
01:16:56,290 --> 01:17:00,220
then I went to a sporting
good store and bought Rut,

1219
01:17:00,880 --> 01:17:02,950
which is basically deer urine.

1220
01:17:04,330 --> 01:17:09,330
I then proceed to load the syringe
with Rut and I injected it.

1221
01:17:09,680 --> 01:17:14,660
I injected it into all the rubber
moldings around the windows of this girls'

1222
01:17:14,661 --> 01:17:17,180
cars.
It smelled awful.

1223
01:17:17,570 --> 01:17:21,830
My parking spot was one level below her
spot and I could smell it every day.

1224
01:17:23,510 --> 01:17:28,190
I know that taking revenge on a car
is a wimpy move, but it did feel good.

1225
01:17:29,060 --> 01:17:33,440
Always remember,
revenge is a dish best served cold.

1226
01:17:35,030 --> 01:17:38,480
Jesus Christ. Wow, man.

1227
01:17:38,560 --> 01:17:40,610
Do you went like fucking CIA on that?

1228
01:17:41,660 --> 01:17:43,970
That's like something they
would miss and like the autopsy,

1229
01:17:44,150 --> 01:17:48,770
cause it's a little fucking
needle fucking holes. Um,

1230
01:17:48,830 --> 01:17:53,210
I got to admit that that is
definitely a, I mean, fucking up.

1231
01:17:53,630 --> 01:17:55,580
Somebody's car's not to original,
but at that is

1232
01:17:57,230 --> 01:18:01,460
that dude you grew up in the backwoods.
No city kid knows about Rut.

1233
01:18:02,510 --> 01:18:06,620
You know what I mean? Yeah.
You grew up in the backwoods.

1234
01:18:07,520 --> 01:18:12,290
You did, didn't you? Your mom's a
diabetic, you know, living in a trailer,

1235
01:18:12,440 --> 01:18:13,760
ate off of George Foreman Grill.

1236
01:18:13,970 --> 01:18:17,900
You're going to show everybody in your
high school class that you will better

1237
01:18:17,901 --> 01:18:21,290
than this. She gets some big fancy
job. You live in a high rise.

1238
01:18:21,291 --> 01:18:26,060
You had your own spot, you know, and
you will looking out your window,

1239
01:18:26,061 --> 01:18:28,820
looking out over the south
street stroke and your cock,

1240
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:32,300
and you thought you had the whole
world by the balls. And what happened?

1241
01:18:33,230 --> 01:18:37,880
They told you fucking Mazda Miata right
out of your goddamn spot, right in a,

1242
01:18:37,881 --> 01:18:39,830
brought you right back to your childhood,
didn't it?

1243
01:18:40,940 --> 01:18:44,970
And then you took revenge the same
way those kids took revenge on you.

1244
01:18:45,110 --> 01:18:49,730
And second grade, I don't want to fucking
go with this shit. All right, let's,

1245
01:18:49,731 --> 01:18:52,380
let's go to this next one.
Uh, all right, Bill. Uh,

1246
01:18:52,490 --> 01:18:53,850
it's just another story of revenge though.

1247
01:18:53,851 --> 01:18:55,880
So I did it check for
two years on and off.

1248
01:18:55,910 --> 01:18:58,970
And this was my first real girlfriend
in high school and I thought she was the

1249
01:18:58,971 --> 01:19:03,620
perfect, most amazing girl in the world.
I was an idiot. And like 17 years old.

1250
01:19:04,010 --> 01:19:07,610
I'm still an idiot, 23 but I sure as
hell won't let this crap happen again.

1251
01:19:07,910 --> 01:19:11,150
Anyways, I let her walk all over
me and I just took it like a bitch.

1252
01:19:11,390 --> 01:19:15,890
It was the kind of thing where she could
fucking cheat on me in front of me and

1253
01:19:15,891 --> 01:19:19,610
I believe her. If she told me she wasn't,
I was, I was that fucking pathetic.

1254
01:19:19,880 --> 01:19:20,631
Eventually though,

1255
01:19:20,631 --> 01:19:23,300
after hearing that your girlfriend
is cheating on you for so long,

1256
01:19:23,510 --> 01:19:24,500
it eats away at you.

1257
01:19:24,960 --> 01:19:27,230
[inaudible] can you hear the
foreboding music in the background?

1258
01:19:27,680 --> 01:19:31,760
Eventually she posted some bullshit
poem on my space, on my space,

1259
01:19:31,761 --> 01:19:35,750
about some dudes she was going out with
at the same time she was going out with

1260
01:19:35,751 --> 01:19:39,500
me. Wow. That's pretty bold.

1261
01:19:40,100 --> 01:19:42,710
And anyway, she goes, the Fucker, uh,

1262
01:19:42,740 --> 01:19:46,340
who she was cheating with even had the
balls to post on there talking about how

1263
01:19:46,341 --> 01:19:49,970
sweet she was.
So finally I had my proof.

1264
01:19:50,780 --> 01:19:55,340
She wasn't getting out of this and
here comes the revenge till I actually

1265
01:19:55,341 --> 01:19:59,510
messaged the guy and start telling him
that I've been fucking her the whole time

1266
01:19:59,511 --> 01:20:00,560
that he's been going out with her,

1267
01:20:00,950 --> 01:20:05,950
he starts telling me that he even knows
of her cheating on him and he took her

1268
01:20:06,321 --> 01:20:10,610
back. So we teamed up to destroyer. See,

1269
01:20:10,720 --> 01:20:14,700
you see this is, this is, this is where
it goes wrong. This is where it gets evil.

1270
01:20:15,820 --> 01:20:16,920
Why do not partake?

1271
01:20:17,150 --> 01:20:22,110
They're teaming up now to destroy another
thing and this is how it plays out.

1272
01:20:22,300 --> 01:20:26,820
All right, here we go. By this time I was
out of high school and they were both,

1273
01:20:27,090 --> 01:20:29,550
and uh,
wait a minute,

1274
01:20:29,660 --> 01:20:32,640
but this time I was out of high school
and they were both at the same high

1275
01:20:32,641 --> 01:20:33,474
school,

1276
01:20:33,540 --> 01:20:38,130
I guess the guy in this girl basically I
showed up to her school and what we did

1277
01:20:38,131 --> 01:20:43,131
was bring up all this shit that she
did up in the middle of all her little

1278
01:20:43,621 --> 01:20:45,930
fucking friends.
She cared about so much.

1279
01:20:46,980 --> 01:20:51,600
She cares so much about and explained
how much of a horseshoe was other dudes

1280
01:20:51,630 --> 01:20:56,070
even came up and said they were going
out with her at the same time I was

1281
01:20:56,100 --> 01:21:00,240
fucking her and shit.
This bitch was the fucking public bicycle.

1282
01:21:00,241 --> 01:21:05,190
Everyone was riding. Will it completely
ruined the rest of high school for now,

1283
01:21:05,191 --> 01:21:10,170
five or six years later, me and the
dude are still friends. There's a wind.

1284
01:21:10,290 --> 01:21:15,270
There's a wind for the guys who got
treated like shit out there. Yeah,

1285
01:21:15,271 --> 01:21:19,470
it is. Yeah. I guess. I don't know, Dude.
That's just fucking, I don't know, man.

1286
01:21:20,070 --> 01:21:23,820
I cut my losses.
I cut my losses.

1287
01:21:25,220 --> 01:21:29,070
That reminds me of an intervention story
where there was this girl whose dad

1288
01:21:29,071 --> 01:21:32,190
didn't stick around. So,
uh, she, I don't know what,

1289
01:21:32,670 --> 01:21:37,320
and she developed young and, uh, the
guys be like, Hey, let me see a titties.

1290
01:21:37,321 --> 01:21:38,490
And she just showed them to them,

1291
01:21:39,270 --> 01:21:41,760
not realize she just liked
the fucking male attention.

1292
01:21:42,330 --> 01:21:45,300
So she's dancing as a cheerleader and
I don't, I don't know what she did.

1293
01:21:45,301 --> 01:21:49,770
She blew a couple of guys. And so she's
dancing as a cheerleader in the hope her,

1294
01:21:49,771 --> 01:21:52,050
her entire college.
I mean,

1295
01:21:52,051 --> 01:21:56,010
high school class just started
chanting whore horror, horror,

1296
01:21:56,040 --> 01:21:57,240
horror or something like that.

1297
01:21:57,241 --> 01:22:00,300
And then she bursted in tears and
it just became a fucking alcoholic.

1298
01:22:00,360 --> 01:22:03,750
You know what I'm saying? But
you know something, you don't,

1299
01:22:03,751 --> 01:22:07,080
you don't have the mentality to know that
at that age. And that show wasn't on.

1300
01:22:08,100 --> 01:22:11,760
So why am I playing armchair
quarterback and ruin your revenge?

1301
01:22:13,290 --> 01:22:17,580
I Dunno. Revenge. Yanno know. I
don't know. Fucking creepy man.

1302
01:22:18,930 --> 01:22:23,670
We ruined the rest of high school for and
then we high fived and kicked a puppy.

1303
01:22:24,310 --> 01:22:28,890
All right, here we go.
Overrated. Underrated. This
is the last thing here. Um,

1304
01:22:29,040 --> 01:22:31,740
overrated. And this is something
that I've been meaning to bring up.

1305
01:22:31,770 --> 01:22:35,010
This is one of the I
overrated that I agree with.

1306
01:22:35,011 --> 01:22:38,010
I think the most overrated
multi-blade raisers.

1307
01:22:39,060 --> 01:22:41,610
A few months ago I started
using my dad's old double,

1308
01:22:41,611 --> 01:22:46,320
a double edge razor made almost
20 years ago before I was born.

1309
01:22:46,350 --> 01:22:47,850
Born.
It's fucking great.

1310
01:22:47,851 --> 01:22:51,420
My face feels better than ever and I can
get a hundred blades for less than what

1311
01:22:51,421 --> 01:22:55,710
it costs for an eight pack of those
three or five blade cartridges. Um,

1312
01:22:55,711 --> 01:23:00,090
if you've got to shave like a man
introduced an element of danger to it.

1313
01:23:00,091 --> 01:23:01,710
I actually have a couple
of straight razors too,

1314
01:23:01,711 --> 01:23:03,990
but it's too much work and I
don't use them on a regular basis.

1315
01:23:04,300 --> 01:23:05,890
There's not been true this fucking,

1316
01:23:06,430 --> 01:23:08,650
one of the worst things that ever
happened to be on the road was I left my

1317
01:23:08,651 --> 01:23:11,770
toiletries behind,
I think in Tampa a long time ago.

1318
01:23:11,980 --> 01:23:15,610
Not only did I use lose
my little tough crowd, uh,

1319
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:20,470
a shaving kit bag,
I lost that fucking thing.

1320
01:23:22,270 --> 01:23:23,340
Um,
and I,

1321
01:23:23,341 --> 01:23:28,341
I lost my twin twin blade razor and then
I went onto the triple red blazer and I

1322
01:23:28,361 --> 01:23:32,020
have a whisker underneath my nose that it
just can't get, it just doesn't get it.

1323
01:23:32,920 --> 01:23:35,200
It sucks around your
chin. It's, it's terrible.

1324
01:23:35,470 --> 01:23:40,090
The two blade razor is the shit and you
will never get a closer shave than that.

1325
01:23:40,091 --> 01:23:42,900
Everything else is fucking bullshit. I
was wondering though, what about the,

1326
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:46,960
have you seen those things on TV? We
can sharpen your razor blades. Anybody?

1327
01:23:46,961 --> 01:23:50,740
I mean, anybody buy one of those? Huh?
Is this podcast going on? Well, my God,

1328
01:23:50,741 --> 01:23:55,120
53 minutes. I gotta get Outta here.
Alright. Underrated. Uh, your podcast.

1329
01:23:55,121 --> 01:23:57,460
It's fucking great. Thank you
very much. I appreciate that.

1330
01:23:58,150 --> 01:24:01,240
Here's another good one.
Overrated chicks and bars and clubs,

1331
01:24:01,330 --> 01:24:03,190
underrated chicks at the laundromat.

1332
01:24:03,670 --> 01:24:06,700
The skill set in these two groups
is so far off. It's ridiculous.

1333
01:24:06,701 --> 01:24:10,630
Chickson bars and clubs just spackle on
so much makeup that they can barely hold

1334
01:24:10,631 --> 01:24:14,350
their heads up long enough to accept
your drink before they shoot you down.

1335
01:24:15,220 --> 01:24:19,990
But Dude, dramatic pause raising
my eyebrows type shit. Um,

1336
01:24:19,991 --> 01:24:23,620
he actually typed up, um, helping me
with my reading ability. I liked that.

1337
01:24:23,621 --> 01:24:28,030
I liked direction, but dude, a
chicken, the laundromat is so sexy.

1338
01:24:28,031 --> 01:24:32,500
It's crazy. They're wearing probably
the last clean shit that they own.

1339
01:24:33,010 --> 01:24:37,040
That's just a little too tight. They don't
meet, they don't put on makeup. So dude,

1340
01:24:37,050 --> 01:24:40,360
you're really sounding like a pervert
right now and how they were in that last

1341
01:24:40,361 --> 01:24:43,750
piece of clean closet they got.
Yeah, it's a little bit too tight.

1342
01:24:45,660 --> 01:24:46,660
Damn.
Put any makeup on?

1343
01:24:47,380 --> 01:24:50,690
They're pretty at that moment and
they look unbelievable and you know,

1344
01:24:50,820 --> 01:24:52,330
they all look like definite rest of time.

1345
01:24:52,510 --> 01:24:55,150
I'm just reading the rest of your
shit like a pervert actually do.

1346
01:24:55,280 --> 01:24:57,490
You're actually, you're right.
He makes some great points there.

1347
01:24:58,090 --> 01:25:02,230
Plus they're doing some responsible shit
while they're hung over and then trying

1348
01:25:02,231 --> 01:25:06,870
not to throw up on their
newly clean clothes. Sorry,
I went too long. He had dude,

1349
01:25:06,880 --> 01:25:11,050
you did. You actually make an a great
point. You do. Yeah, you did. All right.

1350
01:25:11,051 --> 01:25:13,210
That's the end of the podcast.
Okay. Kind of petered out.

1351
01:25:13,630 --> 01:25:17,890
Kind of like the Colorado River,
not reaching the ocean anymore. Um,

1352
01:25:18,940 --> 01:25:19,391
anyways,

1353
01:25:19,391 --> 01:25:24,370
before I'm going to be in Saint Louis
this week at the house of comedy,

1354
01:25:25,570 --> 01:25:27,520
um,
I have the link right there on my website.

1355
01:25:27,521 --> 01:25:30,640
Go to [inaudible] Dot Com B U R r.com.

1356
01:25:31,180 --> 01:25:34,240
And I want to thank everybody
who came out to my Monday shows.

1357
01:25:34,330 --> 01:25:36,490
At the punchline in San Francisco.

1358
01:25:36,491 --> 01:25:40,810
I really wish I talked about that in
the beginning. Um, the honest with you,

1359
01:25:40,811 --> 01:25:45,790
those were two of the best shows I've
ever had in my life. Um, that second show,

1360
01:25:45,940 --> 01:25:48,820
W it was ridiculous. Um, for
those of you who weren't there,

1361
01:25:48,821 --> 01:25:51,460
I just started telling stories and uh,

1362
01:25:53,140 --> 01:25:55,150
I probably did close
to an hour and a half,

1363
01:25:55,151 --> 01:25:58,810
15 minutes of which was
actually from my act.

1364
01:25:59,890 --> 01:26:01,600
So, uh, you know,

1365
01:26:01,601 --> 01:26:04,400
and it was all material I'm never going
to do again because it was all family

1366
01:26:04,401 --> 01:26:08,870
stories and fucked up shit that I
would never talk about on TV. So, um,

1367
01:26:08,990 --> 01:26:10,130
I hope you guys enjoyed it.

1368
01:26:10,820 --> 01:26:14,780
I had a great time and I'm thinking about
coming up there again in a couple of

1369
01:26:14,780 --> 01:26:19,340
months at the punch line and maybe
having that be a regular thing,

1370
01:26:19,341 --> 01:26:24,341
just coming up on Mondays and doing a
couple of shows and just venting about the

1371
01:26:24,411 --> 01:26:27,380
people in my life,
you know,

1372
01:26:27,650 --> 01:26:32,570
and I'm not having to worry about them
ever hearing about it. All right. And uh,

1373
01:26:32,571 --> 01:26:34,940
that is it. Um, thank you
for listening to the podcast.

1374
01:26:34,970 --> 01:26:39,950
Thank you guys for contributing
and, uh, what else?

1375
01:26:40,010 --> 01:26:43,280
Oh, you know what, I, people have
been asking me about my myspace page.

1376
01:26:43,430 --> 01:26:45,230
Ask them about the comments.
Um,

1377
01:26:45,290 --> 01:26:50,180
I kind of haven't been adding accepting
comments since last September.

1378
01:26:50,720 --> 01:26:54,350
I just kind of forgot about it. I just
was adding friends and answering emails.

1379
01:26:54,351 --> 01:26:58,940
I get the podcast took up a lot of times.
So I'm back to accepting comments.

1380
01:26:59,270 --> 01:27:04,270
I literally had like 400 or 600
comments that didn't allow me to,

1381
01:27:05,510 --> 01:27:09,410
uh, you know, here it is.
Comment approvals, uh, click
on this right now. This is,

1382
01:27:09,411 --> 01:27:11,840
this is garbage time right now. You
don't even need to listen to this shit.

1383
01:27:12,650 --> 01:27:17,650
I have a 419 that I have to approve a.

1384
01:27:17,721 --> 01:27:22,670
So I'm trying to, uh, trying
to get back on that shit.

1385
01:27:22,671 --> 01:27:23,540
But anyways,
that's it.

1386
01:27:23,570 --> 01:27:27,740
