SO CLOSE!

A WHOLE LOT OF HOOPS.

-YAY!
-BRILLIANT!

00:00:15.501 --> 00:00:18.534
AND THE WEAPON OF CHOICE
IS A COMPOUND BOW.

WE ARE ALMOST THERE,
AND NOW IT'S TIME TO DIAL

00:00:22.901 --> 00:00:24.701
IN THE AIM ON OUR COMPOUND BOW,

AND IN ORDER TO DO THAT WITHOUT
DESTROYING A TON OF ARROWS,

00:00:26.968 --> 00:00:28.934
WE'VE SCOOCHED
EVERYTHING TO THE RIGHT.

OF THE AXES IN THE WAY,

WE SCOOCH THE WHOLE
RIG BACK 12 INCHES,

AND FIRE IT THROUGH
ALL THE RINGS, IN THEORY.

I HAVE NO IDEA

CLEAN THROUGH THE YELLOW RING,

HAVE A CHANCE TO MATCH ODYSSEUS.

LINING UP THIS ARROW HAS PROVEN
TO BE A LOT MORE DIFFICULT

00:01:47.467 --> 00:01:49.767
THAN WE WERE EXPECTING
BECAUSE NORMALLY YOU AIM

00:01:49.767 --> 00:01:51.901
FOR THE THING THAT'S AT THE END
OF THE ARROW'S FLIGHT,

00:01:51.901 --> 00:01:54.167

SHOT GETS THEM CLOSER

THROUGH THE RING?
