00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:00.660
MATT PARKER: All right.

00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:03.120
I'm going to show you
a math card trick.

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.130
It is a genuine math trick,
there's no sleight of hand,

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:08.200
there's no YouTubery.

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.450
It's not a sneaky edit or
anything like that.

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:12.340
Everything you see is
the whole trick.

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:13.100
It's nothing else.

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:15.870
And also because it is a math
card trick, it will involve a

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.400
lot of tedious counting.

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:19.370
So this is how this
is going to work.

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:21.580
I have a normal deck
of cards, there are

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:22.970
all 52 cards in there.

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:24.250
I'm going to look through.

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:27.320
What I'm going to do is pick one
of the cards and memorize

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:28.660
where it is in the deck.

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:31.540
So I'm going to pick one of
these cards, and then what I'm

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:35.670
going to do is count how many
cards are on top of it.

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.090
And I'm going to remember both
the card I'm thinking of, and

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.190
the number of cards above it.

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:42.020
OK, got it, got it.

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.940
OK, so I'll remember.

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:44.930
I'm remembering one card in this
deck, and I'm remembering

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:45.560
where it is.

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:49.360
What I'm going to do now is
I'm going to broadcast the

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.530
number of card into
Brady's mind.

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:51.840
All right?

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.200
So I'm thinking of a
number of cards.

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.530
I'm going to send that
number into his mind.

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.640
He's going to tell me that
number that I've sent to him,

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.200
and then we're going to
count off that many.

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:03.490
And the next one will be the
card I'm remembering.

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:05.860
Skeptical people may say you're
just going to change

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:07.830
your mind to whatever the card
happens to be, so I'm going to

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:08.490
write down.

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:09.920
In fact, I will show--

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:10.990
How can we do this?

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:11.340
BRADY HARAN: [INAUDIBLE].

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.970
MATT PARKER: Yeah,
if you leave.

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:14.020
If I-- oh, brilliant.

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:14.560
OK.

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:15.990
If I take--

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.480
OK, so we're going to
kick Brady out.

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:18.590
He's going to leave the room.

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:19.480
Just briefly.

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:22.480
Over here, this is
my prediction.

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:28.080
So I'm going to predict
this card here.

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:28.780
OK, that one there.

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:29.660
Cool.

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:32.090
And then if I fold this up.

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.460
BRADY HARAN: OK?

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:33.080
MATT PARKER: Hang on a second.

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:34.330
Hang on.

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:40.150
OK, you can't see that.

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:41.560
Actually, I'll put
it down there.

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:42.070
OK, cool.

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:42.990
Yep, yep, you're good.

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:43.610
You're good.

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:45.910
So, I wrote it down on
a piece of paper.

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:47.480
I openly scrunched it
up with one hand and

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:48.480
I put it down there.

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:50.600
But everyone has seen the
card I'm thinking of.

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:55.820
So now, when I send this number
into your mind, the

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.250
number, I'm going to count off
that many cards, and bam, the

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:00.390
next one will be the one
that I wrote down

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:01.590
on that piece paper.

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.700
And in case it goes wrong, I
reserve the right to do this

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:05.840
up to twice.

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.430
At that point, we'll
just call it off.

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:08.940
OK, so here we go.

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.060
Here comes the number, Brady.

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.490
What is it?

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.990
BRADY HARAN: 12.

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.330
MATT PARKER: 12.

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.490
OK, so I'm going to take off 12
cards, the next one will be

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:16.320
the one that I wrote down.

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.880
Here we go, ready?

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:23.670
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,
8, 9, 10, 11, 12.

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:24.380
OK, next card.

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:27.470
Next card is the
King of Spades.

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:30.100
I did not write down
the King of Spades.

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.470
That is not the card
I wrote down.

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:34.910
But I tell you what,
we'll try again.

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:35.630
We'll try again.

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:36.500
We'll do one more time.

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:37.140
So, ready?

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.540
OK, ready?

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:38.250
What's the number?

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.850
Here it comes.

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:41.270
BRADY HARAN: 15.

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:42.130
MATT PARKER: 15 this time.

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.480
OK, here we go.

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:43.190
15, are you ready?

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.790
Here we go.

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:51.940
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,
10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15.

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:52.720
OK, here we go.

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.150
Did I write down, did I write
down the 4 of Spades?

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:57.360
I did not.

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.850
I did not write down
the 4 of Spades.

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:05.030
What I actually wrote down
was the 8 of Diamonds.

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:08.540
And you might think that this
trick is a bit of a bust.

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.490
You tried to guess the number
twice, you said 12 the first

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:13.090
time, you said 15
the second time.

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:14.390
It wasn't at either of
those positions.

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:18.680
It turns out giving you one
number in your mind would be

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.910
slightly impressive, sending
you two numbers

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:21.610
would be even better.

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:24.390
If you changed your mind even
slightly on either of those

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:27.080
numbers, the difference wouldn't
have been three.

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:30.020
You actually had to take three
cards off, and then

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.580
it's the next one.

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:32.910
And again, if you hadn't
said 12 and 15, we

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:33.580
wouldn't have got 3.

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:34.490
Are you ready?

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:36.440
1, 2, 3.

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.658
The next card is the
8 of Diamonds.

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:44.300
And now I just look
smug for a while.

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:46.860
That's my trick where I send
numbers into someone's brain.

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:51.340
Yeah, OK.

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:54.690
It's always, to be fair, every
time you do the trick, you

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:56.080
have to deal it out twice.

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:59.540
You have to put it back together
each time, and it

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:00.670
always ends up being
the difference

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:01.450
between the two numbers.

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:03.480
And obviously, this started
off in a very particular

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:06.670
position, and it was a position
where, by dealing it

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:09.760
out twice, it always ends
up at the difference.

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.990
There i one slight tweak,
depending on if the second

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:16.269
number the person says was
bigger or smaller than the

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:18.519
first number, and so you have
to do something slightly

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:19.720
different in that case.

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:22.250
But if you get a pack of cards
and you have a bit of a play

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:23.170
with it, you'll be
able to work it

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:24.630
out reasonably quickly.

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:33.560
OK, if you're still here,
I'll explain most of

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:34.510
how the trick works.

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:36.730
And so what I did, when I looked
through the cards, I

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:37.750
was looking for them.

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:39.590
And to be honest, I wasn't
counting or anything, I was

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:41.170
just looking to see what
the top card was.

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:42.670
And as we know, it was
the 8 of Diamonds.

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:44.640
So you look through, see what
the top card is, that's the

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:45.770
card you write down.

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:49.750
So now, when you start sending
numbers into someone's brain,

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:51.750
you've got to pay attention to
what happens to the top card.

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:54.740
So Brady, the first number
he said was 12.

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:58.060
And so when I start counting
12, the top card off is the

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:58.870
chosen card.

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:05.450
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,
8, 9, 10, 11, 12.

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:08.530
And when you count cards off
into a pile, you're reversing

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:09.130
their order.

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:11.090
Because what was the top
card is now the bottom

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:11.830
card of this pile.

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:14.550
And a lot of maths magic tricks
use the fact that you

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:16.700
reverse cards when you
deal them out.

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:19.500
So when I put them back
together, the 8 of Diamonds

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:22.150
will now become the 12th
card from the top.

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:25.970
In fact, whatever number your
volunteer says first, it will

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:28.280
end up being that card
from the top.

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:31.050
And so now, Brady picked 15,
which was a bigger number.

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:33.740
And so as I count to 15, first
of all I have to count up to

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:35.390
12 to get to 15.

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:42.140
So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,
10, 11, and as the 12th card

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:44.420
comes off, that was our original
8 of Diamonds.

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:46.280
Because we've just reversed
12 again.

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:49.480
And then you count 13, 14, 15.

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:51.310
And so in fact, I've got to put
three more cards on top to

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:52.570
go from 12 to 15.

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:56.130
I have to put the difference of
the two numbers on top to

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:58.760
go from the first number to
get to the second number.

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:00.800
And when I put them back
together now, all I have to do

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:01.930
is take off those three.

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:03.890
So I take off the difference.

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:05.320
1, 2, 3.

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:06.720
And the next card is
our friend, the

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:08.390
8 of Diamonds again.

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:11.870
And so no matter what two
numbers they say, as long as

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:14.750
the first one's smaller, the
first time you deal, it puts

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:15.540
it into that position.

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:17.760
The second time you deal, it
reverses it back to the

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:20.000
original order, and then you
put the extra ones on top.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.810
Once you take those off,
it's right there.

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:27.670
If you're still watching, then
you want to work out what

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:30.160
happens when the second
number is smaller

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:30.880
than the first number.

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:32.120
So I'll show you again.

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:35.520
So we'll pretend Brady did the
same thing, but he said 15

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:37.050
first, then 12 second.

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:39.510
So there's the 8 of Diamonds,
it's still on top.

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:40.830
So first of all, 15.

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:41.580
OK, so 1.

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:41.900
There's the 8.

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:48.260
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,
10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15.

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:49.850
I put it back on top.

00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:52.350
Now, the trouble is if the
second number's smaller,

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:54.580
you're not going to get back
to the chosen card.

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:55.750
You're just not going
to get far enough.

00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:58.033
But what you will do is you'll
take off, well, let's say 12.

00:06:58.033 --> 00:07:03.860
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,
8, 9, 10, 11, 12.

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:05.480
And then obviously you're going
to do the thing with oh,

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:05.950
no, that's not it.

00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:07.490
It didn't work, boo hoo.

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:10.000
The trick now is instead of
putting these back on top, put

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.460
them underneath.

00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:15.140
Because now you've put it into
the 15th position, which is

00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:16.310
the first big number.

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:18.400
You've then taken
away that 12.

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:20.320
In fact, it's still the
difference between the two

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:23.180
numbers, with one slight,
subtle change.

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:25.700
Instead of taking off that many
cards and then the next

00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:28.610
one, you take off that many
cards as the last one.

00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:29.010
I'll show you.

00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:31.670
So in this case, I would say oh,
you picked 15 and 12, the

00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:32.990
difference is 3.

00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:34.800
Wow, it's actually
the third card.

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:35.760
Here we go, ready?

00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:38.210
1, 2, 3.

00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:39.130
And there it is.

00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:39.670
It's the third card.

00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:41.760
And so it's still the
difference, but all you need

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:44.760
to do is make sure, instead of
counting off all of them first

00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:46.930
and then revealing it, you count
them off and turn over

00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:48.180
the last one.

00:07:53.246 --> 00:07:54.690
OK.

00:07:54.690 --> 00:07:58.010
What if they pick the
same number twice?

00:07:58.010 --> 00:08:01.860
Now, if they pick the same
number twice, then what you

00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:04.640
need to do is--

00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:06.950
I mean obviously, you can play
off the fact that they're

00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:08.980
very, very insistent that
that's the number.

00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:11.320
And you say look, you seem
very insistent mean.

00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:12.010
In fact, you're right.

00:08:12.010 --> 00:08:13.200
That is the number
I was sending.

00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:14.610
Something just went wrong
the first time,

00:08:14.610 --> 00:08:15.630
so I doubted myself.

00:08:15.630 --> 00:08:17.620
But you know what, it probably
is that number.

00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:19.510
Then you count them off again,
and the important thing is

00:08:19.510 --> 00:08:22.520
this time you count off that
many times, and then you turn

00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:23.290
over the last one
you're counting.

00:08:23.290 --> 00:08:24.230
So I'll show you very quickly.

00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:25.730
So 8 was the top.

00:08:25.730 --> 00:08:27.730
Let's say Brady said
12 the first time.

00:08:27.730 --> 00:08:32.950
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,
9, 9, 10, 11, 12.

00:08:32.950 --> 00:08:34.080
Oh no, I got it wrong.

00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:35.200
I'll put them back on again.

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:36.890
And then he's like
no, no, I insist.

00:08:36.890 --> 00:08:37.710
It's definitely 12.

00:08:37.710 --> 00:08:39.000
You go OK, well we'll check.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:40.820
Maybe it's just the 12th card.

00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:42.780
Maybe that's the number I'm
trying to send you.

00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:48.730
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,
8, 9, 10, 11, 12.

00:08:48.730 --> 00:08:49.370
Oh, it is.

00:08:49.370 --> 00:08:50.930
Wow, how about that?

00:08:50.930 --> 00:08:51.680
It still works.

00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:52.480
So there you are.

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:56.452
That's what you do if they say
the same number twice.

00:08:56.452 --> 00:08:57.400
JAMES CLEWETT: Here we go.

00:08:57.400 --> 00:08:59.320
Here's my home made
lottery balls.

00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:00.976
I'm going to give them
a little shake.

00:09:00.976 --> 00:09:03.170
And I'm looking away because
I really don't

00:09:03.170 --> 00:09:05.130
want to cheat here.

00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:05.990
Looking away.

00:09:05.990 --> 00:09:07.180
I've got one hand in there.

00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:11.160
I'm pulling out a ball,
and it's number two.

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:12.480
MATT PARKER: Yes, there
is one more option.

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:15.840
What if they say 1 or 0 at
the very, very beginning?

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:18.430
And if they say 1 or 0 at the
very, very beginning, this is

00:09:18.430 --> 00:09:19.200
perfect, right?

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:20.650
And this has actually
happened to me.

00:09:20.650 --> 00:09:24.030
Twice now, someone said
1, it's the top card.

00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:26.590
And so what you do is you go,
really, the top card?

00:09:26.590 --> 00:09:27.420
You really think
I just put it--

00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:29.110
And t hey go yeah, I'm
absolutely certain.

00:09:29.110 --> 00:09:31.280
You go, well good, I'm glad
you're certain, because it is

00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:32.420
the top card.

00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:33.850
And then their brain blows up.

00:09:33.850 --> 00:09:35.090
It's absolutely amazing.

00:09:35.090 --> 00:09:36.970
And I think that is
all the options.
