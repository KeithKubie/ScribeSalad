Now that you understand the components of the diffuse reflection model give

00:00:02.646 --> 00:00:06.275
them a try. In the demo that follows we'll use the terms KA, and KD in the

00:00:06.275 --> 00:00:10.259
reflection equation. These are simply numbers used to scale the effect of the

00:00:10.259 --> 00:00:14.310
ambient and diffuse contributions up and down. KA is the greyscale level of the

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:18.979
ambient light and KD is handy way to modify the diffuse contribution. To sum up

00:00:18.979 --> 00:00:23.334
the equation we use for this demo it's fragment color equals KA times material

00:00:23.334 --> 00:00:28.634
plus KD times material times N.L. This is actually a bit simplified from what

00:00:28.634 --> 00:00:32.476
3JS allows. In 3JS, you can inset an entirely different ambient color, though

00:00:32.476 --> 00:00:36.610
to be honest, this is a peculiar thing to do. Also, in this demo, you'll a see

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:39.201
different color space used. Instead of RGB, it's hue, saturation and lightness.

00:00:39.201 --> 00:00:40.243
HSL for short. Hue means the color essentially. Saturation is how much the hue

00:00:40.243 --> 00:00:47.114
is used. Lightness is a scale factor, letting you easily make the color itself

00:00:47.114 --> 00:00:53.880
brighter or darker. Here's a visualization of the color space. The 3JS library

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:58.740
let's you use HSL to set colors. For example, this code gives a mustard color.

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:03.157
So go try out the demo. Vary the ambiant and diffuse contributions. Change the

00:01:03.157 --> 00:01:06.536
material color. Move the view around and see the effect. It's worth your while

00:01:06.536 --> 00:01:08.830
to catch your breath and play around a bit so that you truly understand this

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:10.200
reflection model.
