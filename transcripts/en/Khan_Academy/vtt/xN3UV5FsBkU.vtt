00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.804
What I want to do in this video is

00:00:01.804 --> 00:00:04.621
make sure we understand the difference between

00:00:04.621 --> 00:00:07.639
"comparative advantage" and "absolute advantage".

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:09.242
What we saw in the last video is that

00:00:09.242 --> 00:00:11.798
Patty had a comparative advantage in plates

00:00:11.798 --> 00:00:14.095
relative to Charlie because

00:00:14.095 --> 00:00:17.633
her opportunity cost of producing one plate was

00:00:17.633 --> 00:00:21.573
lower than Charlie's opportunity cost of producing a plate.

00:00:21.573 --> 00:00:24.791
Hers was one-third of a cup, his was three cups.

00:00:24.791 --> 00:00:27.609
So, that's why it made sense for her to specialize in plates.

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:29.512
Charlie on the other hand had

00:00:29.512 --> 00:00:31.784
a comparative advantage in cups;

00:00:31.784 --> 00:00:33.629
his opportunity cost for producing a cup

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:35.381
was only a third of a plate,

00:00:35.381 --> 00:00:37.640
while Patty's was three plates.

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.335
So that's why he specialized in cups.

00:00:40.335 --> 00:00:43.584
Now, we can't confuse this with absolute advantage.

00:00:43.584 --> 00:00:47.171
Absolute advantage in a given product just means that

00:00:47.171 --> 00:00:49.210
you are more productive

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:51.572
at that thing given the same inputs.

00:00:51.572 --> 00:00:53.870
And so if I were to just give you this graph,

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.969
and you didn't know how many workers Charlie or Patty had

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.770
and how many inputs they're using to produce

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.310
either thirty cups in a day or thirty plates in a day,

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:03.436
you actually could not make any statement

00:01:03.436 --> 00:01:05.230
about absolute advantage.

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:07.547
But if we assume that in all of these scenarios

00:01:07.547 --> 00:01:09.102
they have the same number of inputs,

00:01:09.102 --> 00:01:10.658
so if we think about plates . . .

00:01:10.658 --> 00:01:13.987
If we say they each have one employee,

00:01:13.987 --> 00:01:15.269
maybe it's themselves,

00:01:15.269 --> 00:01:16.602
and given that one input,

00:01:16.602 --> 00:01:18.228
or the same number of inputs,

00:01:18.228 --> 00:01:22.222
Patty is able to produce more plates than Charlie,

00:01:22.222 --> 00:01:24.102
then it is true that Patty would have

00:01:24.102 --> 00:01:25.983
an absolute advantage in plates.

00:01:25.983 --> 00:01:28.079
And if given the same number of inputs,

00:01:28.079 --> 00:01:31.112
Charlie is able to produce more cups than Patty,

00:01:31.112 --> 00:01:34.321
then he would have an absolute advantage in cups.

00:01:34.321 --> 00:01:36.360
But it is not because of that absolute advantage

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.400
that he is specializing in it.

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.000
In fact, we don't even know what their inputs were.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.400
It might be that he doesn't have an absolute advantage.

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.664
Maybe Charlie needs

00:01:44.664 --> 00:01:46.928
a hundred people to produce his thirty cups,

00:01:46.928 --> 00:01:50.643
while Patty can produce ten cups with one person.

00:01:50.643 --> 00:01:51.807
So in that case,

00:01:51.807 --> 00:01:53.894
actually Patty would have an absolute advantage,

00:01:53.894 --> 00:01:56.587
but it just wouldn't be obvious from this right over here.

00:01:56.587 --> 00:01:58.997
But to make everything clear,

00:01:58.997 --> 00:02:02.300
I want to do a scenario where

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:05.411
Charlie improved his productivity in some way and

00:02:05.411 --> 00:02:09.524
he actually has the absolute advantage in both products,

00:02:09.544 --> 00:02:10.938
and still show that as long as

00:02:10.938 --> 00:02:13.008
they have different comparative advantages,

00:02:13.008 --> 00:02:16.080
then it still makes sense for them to specialize.

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.900
So let's do another scenario.

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.244
So Charlie has improved dramatically.

00:02:23.244 --> 00:02:26.309
So let's draw our little graph here.

00:02:26.309 --> 00:02:30.646
That's our cups axis, this is still our plates axis.

00:02:30.646 --> 00:02:33.762
Cups and plates . . .

00:02:33.762 --> 00:02:35.771
and let's just put some more markers here...

00:02:35.771 --> 00:02:40.427
ten, twenty, thirty and forty.

00:02:40.427 --> 00:02:47.903
And ten, twenty, thirty and forty, and

00:02:47.903 --> 00:02:50.736
let's still put Patty, let's assume Patty hasn't changed,

00:02:50.736 --> 00:02:55.659
so this is her PPF, so that is Patty's PPF, just like that.

00:02:55.659 --> 00:02:59.328
But let's say that Charlie has improved dramatically.

00:02:59.328 --> 00:03:02.300
And so Charlie's PPF looks like this.

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:06.933
So this is Charlie's PPF now looks like this.

00:03:06.933 --> 00:03:08.978
So in a given day he can produce

00:03:08.978 --> 00:03:10.077
- and let's just assume

00:03:10.077 --> 00:03:11.761
they're using the same number of inputs-

00:03:11.761 --> 00:03:13.974
so using the same number of inputs in a given day

00:03:13.974 --> 00:03:15.344
he can produce forty cups

00:03:15.344 --> 00:03:16.975
when Patty can only produce ten.

00:03:16.975 --> 00:03:18.972
So he has the absolute advantage in cups.

00:03:18.972 --> 00:03:22.426
Or, in the same given day using the same inputs,

00:03:22.426 --> 00:03:24.246
he could produce forty plates

00:03:24.246 --> 00:03:26.534
while Patty can only produce thirty.

00:03:26.534 --> 00:03:29.022
So now Charlie, all of a sudden,

00:03:29.022 --> 00:03:33.030
has an absolute advantage in both products.

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:34.947
But we'll see it still makes sense for them to specialize

00:03:34.947 --> 00:03:37.611
because they have different comparative advantages;

00:03:37.611 --> 00:03:39.823
they have different opportunity costs.

00:03:39.823 --> 00:03:41.682
So let's figure this out.

00:03:41.682 --> 00:03:44.195
So we have all the same numbers for Patty -

00:03:44.195 --> 00:03:48.554
actually, let me copy and paste Patty's numbers right here.

00:03:48.554 --> 00:03:50.319
Actually we have access to her numbers right over here

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:51.991
so I don't have to copy and paste it.

00:03:51.991 --> 00:03:54.667
But let's think of Charlie's new numbers now.

00:03:54.667 --> 00:03:56.952
So this is the PPF for Charlie.

00:03:56.952 --> 00:03:59.237
So this is our new PPF for Charlie.

00:03:59.237 --> 00:04:01.232
Maybe he did some investment or R&amp;D

00:04:01.232 --> 00:04:05.551
to get this new, awesome, productive PPF.

00:04:05.551 --> 00:04:06.920
So he's expanded his PPF.

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:09.704
So what is his opportunity costs?

00:04:09.704 --> 00:04:16.115
Say he's sitting here - so he's producing 40 cups -

00:04:16.115 --> 00:04:18.551
what would be his opportunity cost of producing 40 plates?

00:04:18.551 --> 00:04:20.779
Well to produce those forty plates,

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:24.067
he would have to give up those forty cups.

00:04:24.067 --> 00:04:26.995
So his opportunity cost of forty plates

00:04:26.995 --> 00:04:29.708
is equal to forty cups.

00:04:29.708 --> 00:04:31.882
Or you divide both sides by forty:

00:04:31.882 --> 00:04:37.734
his opportunity costs for one plate is equal to one cup.

00:04:37.734 --> 00:04:40.311
And this makes math very easy:

00:04:40.311 --> 00:04:46.330
his opportunity cost for one cup is equal to one plate.

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:49.841
Now given this new reality - so we've already established

00:04:49.841 --> 00:04:52.296
Charlie has an absolute advantage in both.

00:04:52.296 --> 00:04:54.895
Using the same inputs he can do more of either of them.

00:04:54.895 --> 00:04:55.833
And remember,

00:04:55.833 --> 00:04:57.131
when you're talking about absolute advantage

00:04:57.131 --> 00:04:59.460
you have to think about the amount of inputs you use.

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:01.333
Who's more productive in that way?

00:05:01.333 --> 00:05:03.989
But let's think about comparative advantage.

00:05:03.989 --> 00:05:05.449
If we think about plates,

00:05:05.449 --> 00:05:07.804
who has a lower opportunity cost for producing a plate?

00:05:07.804 --> 00:05:09.127
Patty hasn't changed.

00:05:09.127 --> 00:05:11.578
Her opportunity cost for producing a plate

00:05:11.578 --> 00:05:13.880
is one-third of a cup.

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:15.629
Charlie's opportunity cost for producing a plate

00:05:15.629 --> 00:05:20.087
has improved, but it's still worse than Patty's.

00:05:20.087 --> 00:05:22.595
He has to spend one cup to make a plate,

00:05:22.595 --> 00:05:25.892
she only has to give up one-third of a cup to make a plate.

00:05:25.892 --> 00:05:29.747
So Patty still has a comparative advantage in plates.

00:05:29.747 --> 00:05:33.743
And if we look at the opportunity cost in cups,

00:05:33.743 --> 00:05:37.933
the opportunity cost for Charlie to make 1 cup is 1 plate.

00:05:37.933 --> 00:05:43.928
So it's actually a little bit worse than it was before,

00:05:43.928 --> 00:05:46.911
but as we'll see it ends up being a good thing,

00:05:46.911 --> 00:05:48.462
he's just overall more productive.

00:05:48.462 --> 00:05:51.901
But his opportunity cost for one cup,

00:05:51.901 --> 00:05:53.326
he's giving up one plate now,

00:05:53.326 --> 00:05:55.567
when before he was producing one third of a plate.

00:05:55.567 --> 00:05:57.267
And that's because in the other scenario,

00:05:57.267 --> 00:06:02.301
he was more one-sided, I guess is one way to say it.

00:06:02.301 --> 00:06:04.969
But his opportunity cost for producing a cup

00:06:04.969 --> 00:06:08.324
is still cheaper than Patty's.

00:06:08.324 --> 00:06:11.017
Her opportunity cost of producing a cup is three plates:

00:06:11.017 --> 00:06:12.395
her opportunity cost.

00:06:12.395 --> 00:06:14.188
While his is only one plate.

00:06:14.188 --> 00:06:18.667
So he still has the comparative advantage in cups.

00:06:18.667 --> 00:06:26.966
So Charlie should still specialize in cups . . .

00:06:26.966 --> 00:06:29.455
and Patty should still specialize in plates.

00:06:29.455 --> 00:06:31.932
And to show that they can still get an outcome that

00:06:31.932 --> 00:06:35.052
is beyond even Charlie's Production Possibilities Frontier,

00:06:35.067 --> 00:06:37.062
let's think about how they could trade.

00:06:37.062 --> 00:06:38.896
So Charlie's going to specialize in cups;

00:06:38.896 --> 00:06:42.667
he's going to sit right over there producing forty cups a day.

00:06:42.667 --> 00:06:46.988
And Patty's going to specialize in plates,

00:06:47.003 --> 00:06:48.196
and she's going to sit right there

00:06:48.196 --> 00:06:51.490
- let me use a different color, I don't want to use this color -

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:54.761
she's going to sit right there and produce thirty plates a day.

00:06:54.761 --> 00:06:57.890
So how could they trade for mutual benefit?

00:06:57.890 --> 00:07:00.112
Well any trade that is -

00:07:00.112 --> 00:07:03.068
assuming that they don't want to have only plates

00:07:03.068 --> 00:07:04.769
or they don't only want to have cups.

00:07:04.769 --> 00:07:06.574
Any trade that is cheaper

00:07:06.574 --> 00:07:09.082
than their opportunity cost will be a good one.

00:07:09.082 --> 00:07:12.565
So for example, Patty is sitting here producing only plates.

00:07:12.565 --> 00:07:18.340
Her opportunity cost for a cup is three plates.

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:21.263
So she would be willing to trade

00:07:21.263 --> 00:07:23.937
anything less than three plates for a cup,

00:07:23.937 --> 00:07:25.103
assuming that she wants it.

00:07:25.103 --> 00:07:27.000
Because, if she had to make the cups herself,

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.333
she would have to give up three plates.

00:07:29.333 --> 00:07:42.797
So let's say that Patty would be willing to trade one cup

00:07:42.797 --> 00:07:45.501
sorry, one plate -

00:07:45.501 --> 00:07:52.205
actually she'd be willing to trade two plates for one cup.

00:07:52.205 --> 00:07:53.772
She's be willing to trade that,

00:07:53.772 --> 00:07:57.722
because if she had to make the cups herself,

00:07:57.722 --> 00:07:59.887
she'd have to give up three plates for one cup.

00:07:59.887 --> 00:08:02.255
So she's willing to trade two plates for one cup.

00:08:02.255 --> 00:08:04.018
And let's see if Charlie would be willing

00:08:04.018 --> 00:08:05.901
to trade two plates for one cup.

00:08:05.901 --> 00:08:07.615
So he has all of these cups -

00:08:07.615 --> 00:08:10.150
how many cups does he have to give away for a plate?

00:08:10.150 --> 00:08:13.900
Well he has to give away one cup for a plate.

00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:17.162
Now he would have to give away one cup for two plates,

00:08:17.162 --> 00:08:19.400
or he would have to give up half a cup for a plate.

00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:24.795
Either way, this is better than his opportunity cost of

00:08:24.795 --> 00:08:27.165
trying to get that incremental plate.

00:08:27.165 --> 00:08:28.948
So he would be willing to do that too:

00:08:28.948 --> 00:08:30.466
two plates for one cup.

00:08:30.466 --> 00:08:32.906
He'd be willing to do one cup for two plates.

00:08:32.906 --> 00:08:36.279
And to see how that would improve,

00:08:36.279 --> 00:08:38.939
he could have forty cups

00:08:38.939 --> 00:08:42.229
or he could trade one of them away -

00:08:42.229 --> 00:08:43.301
Actually, let's do a scenario

00:08:43.301 --> 00:08:48.658
where he trades ten of the cups away.

00:08:48.658 --> 00:08:51.417
So now he only has twenty cups,

00:08:51.417 --> 00:08:55.561
but for those twenty cups he traded away -

00:08:55.561 --> 00:08:56.873
Actually, that's a bad example

00:08:56.873 --> 00:08:58.610
because Patty won't have enough cups.

00:08:58.610 --> 00:09:02.070
So let's say he trades away ten cups.

00:09:02.070 --> 00:09:07.708
Let's say he trades away ten cups for twenty plates.

00:09:07.708 --> 00:09:19.276
So Charlie trades 10 cups for 20 plates.

00:09:19.276 --> 00:09:22.875
So now he trades ten cups and he gets twenty plates.

00:09:22.875 --> 00:09:26.172
So now he'll end up at this scenario over here,

00:09:26.172 --> 00:09:28.200
which was beyond, which was unattainable,

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:29.769
when he was working by himself,

00:09:29.769 --> 00:09:32.396
when he didn't specialize and get gains from trade.

00:09:32.396 --> 00:09:34.000
So this is a good scenario for him.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:35.656
He's able to get outcomes he otherwise

00:09:35.656 --> 00:09:37.384
would not have been able to get.

00:09:37.384 --> 00:09:38.728
He could, depending on how he trades,

00:09:38.728 --> 00:09:42.774
he could get outcomes, well up to a certain point,

00:09:42.774 --> 00:09:46.513
because Patty only has thirty cups.

00:09:46.513 --> 00:09:51.283
So at best he can take all of Patty's cups.

00:09:51.283 --> 00:09:53.728
So he can get something along that line over there.

00:09:53.728 --> 00:09:55.887
But if we look at the same scenario,

00:09:55.887 --> 00:09:59.045
Patty traded twenty plates for ten cups:

00:09:59.045 --> 00:10:00.649
where does that put her?

00:10:00.649 --> 00:10:03.743
So she traded twenty plates, so she's down ten plates

00:10:03.743 --> 00:10:07.504
but she got ten cups, so that put her right over here.

00:10:07.504 --> 00:10:10.880
Once again, beyond her Production Possibilities Frontier,

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:12.464
so this would look like

00:10:12.464 --> 00:10:15.649
a pretty good situation for Patty as well.
