00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
Hi, everyone. My name's Tamara Chambers, and this is Tamara Just Saw

00:00:04.299 --> 00:00:10.888
I went and saw a hit man's bodyguard, solo, today. Cody is doing comedy in another state

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:15.810
So I went to see hit man's bodyguard which is about a Hitman who needs a bodyguard

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:23.250
All right, we're done here. It was fine, guys. It was- There were funny moments.

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:25.720
It had good action

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:31.920
The cinematography was pretty. It looked good. The script was weak. It felt like any other

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:37.859
kind of action film that I've ever seen. Ryan Reynolds has a really great sense of

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:46.770
joking for deadpool. It really works for that character to always be on and always be joking and I think that's why he's just

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:52.980
Perfect as deadpool. It doesn't work for every other character that he's going to play and it was it

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.660
It was a similar vibe. The character was written as kind of like this uptight

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:00.010
kind of

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:01.960
like "by the books" guy

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:09.180
But then with Ryan Reynolds like always throwing in his kind of joke style it felt, just, kind of like... like funny

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:16.619
Good moments, but also super clashing against what the character is supposed to be. Samuel L. Jackson was amazing this role was written

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:24.599
Specifically for him. He was very funny his comedy made sense in the role. It just didn't work for me with Ryan Reynolds

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:31.859
With his comedy style. Again, he was very funny in it, just the character wasn't supposed to be that way

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.699
I don't know how to say her name salma Hayek salma Hayek also

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:38.909
Played Samuel L. Jackson's wife and she was

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:44.970
So funny. This is my favorite movie I've seen her in. I don't know that I've seen her in much

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.649
But she really hit the character just very well. She was written really funny

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:55.499
As like... the story in a whole it was... it was a cute story. I feel like I've seen it before

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:01.049
The biggest disappointment story wise though was the love story between Ryan Reynolds and his

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.159
Ex-Wife or

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:06.359
Ex-fiance I guess spoilers. I don't know it's not like

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:11.669
You know a harry potter movie where it's going to ruin everything for you. This is just what happens in the film.

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:17.950
Is...He... Ryan Reynold's character gets upset at his ex-wife

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:21.070
Because he messes up this job

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:27.040
And he thinks she's the one who kind of sold him out on the job and ended up being Samuel L. Jackson. Which is very like

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:33.219
"Of course", but he blames her so much for something that she didn't do that

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:39.730
They have to separate and then halfway through the movie he decides to forgive her which doesn't go well obviously. Then at the end he

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:46.210
Finally like fully says "I'm sorry" for it then they get back together immediately. And it just feels very

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:52.540
"Blah!" like they don't have any chemistry like in Deadpool the...the lady he was with in Deadpool

00:02:52.540 --> 00:03:00.099
(I don't know anyone's names) but they had such good chemistry together that it just felt so good and perfect and

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:02.470
Real. This just was like

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:06.730
"I don't care about you guys as a couple it also doesn't really matter to me if you get together again"

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:12.819
You know what I mean? Is that harsh? That's a little harsh, sorry. Like I said though. I really enjoyed Samuel  L. Jackson's

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:15.340
part in this. He had some great lines.

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:21.130
"I am Harm's way. I am harm's way, Same, I'm harm's way.

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:25.600
Samuel L Jackson also sings in the film a couple times and at one point

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:30.040
It's really touching, as he's doing it for his wife, another part is he's doing it to annoy

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:36.819
Ryan Reynolds character and again another character thing with Ryan Reynolds. Ryan Reynolds starts singing and it's just very out of...

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:42.999
Because he's sitting there mad that he's singing like he wants to keep quiet and everything orderly, but then to annoy Samuel L. Jackson

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:49.059
He starts loudly singing it just doesn't feel like something that is character would do, and if somebody else was playing it

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:56.950
Maybe could have pulled it off but Ryan reynolds is such a funny... trying to be funny (which normally, usually, does well with) but

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:03.130
this was just it felt like I was watching Ryan Reynolds play deadpool play this kind of

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:05.420
tight-ass

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:09.039
Bodyguard. It was weird. The character of Samuel L. Jackson is

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:13.869
Driven by the love of his wife and just really

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:20.170
sweet that it just comes down to that the whole movie really for him his motivation is is the love of his wife to

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:25.210
where one point he risks his life in the whole mission just to put some flowers in a

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:30.129
vantage point where she'll see from her jail cell. She's in jail, as well, and at the beginning

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:35.140
They're like we'll pardon your wife if you help us with this mission, and he's like oh

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:39.160
You'll pardon my wife who has done nothing wrong

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:44.830
That's some white shit. It's just really funny. He calls people out in a good way

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:50.319
He's really tough, but it just it comes down to love for him. To the point where Ryan Reynolds, and it was like

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:53.710
"Why is it always love with you?" He's like, " Well, what else is there?"

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:59.590
It's really good, and I just the... the difference of how I loved these characters is so crazy

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:04.869
I really really loved samuel Jackson. And Ryan Reynolds... I take it or leave it

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:08.170
It's weird because I think if it would have been another

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:12.760
Person cast other than Ryan Reynolds. I don't think the movie would have done as well

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:17.529
I think they had good chemistry together: Ryan Reynolds and samuel L. jackson. Especially towards the end

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:21.549
But there were just weird joke moments that just didn't work

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:23.480
there's kind of

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:25.569
Like that's not what your character would do

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:29.679
Deadpool look great, but just be something else

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:32.590
You need to get Simon Pegg in here

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:38.800
He'll show us a different character. Also the main bad guy is pretty forgettable as well

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:42.999
I really wasn't invested at all in that portion of the story just felt like

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:49.510
Like I said before just like any other action film that I've ever seen, really it's about these two men

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:52.509
Having to work together when one of them is trying to kill the other like

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:55.539
27- 28 times it's more about that

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:56.030
and

00:05:56.030 --> 00:06:01.630
Then you get this side story of the love and the love and you get the side side story of like the evil bad guys

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:02.450
and

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:07.659
So in that respect, it's fine and it works, because they have good chemistry together

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:09.620
but

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:16.420
The main like, chunk, of like the... where the action comes from and like why they're doing this for this...

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:19.270
Like "rid the world of this bad guy", just is

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:27.279
Boring, I don't care that much. So the one part where Ryan Reynolds is like. "I forgive you" to his ex-fiancee

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:29.800
For something that she didn't do

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:34.570
Samuel L. Jackson is like. "How did that go buddy? Women don't like to be forgiven for something because it implies

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:38.230
They did something wrong." and like seven guys behind me

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:41.830
gave like uh... like a low bro chuckle. Like a uh-huh huh huh

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:44.380
like in unison

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:46.250
 

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:49.419
I mean it's true. Really cool setting though in amsterdam

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:56.409
They really used like the canal ways and the waterways, and it was really exciting. I've also been there. So that was cool

00:06:56.410 --> 00:07:02.050
I know this place. It's like when I get a movie reference that I used to not get. I just kept

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:05.709
Comparing it to deadpool. The whole time while watching it

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:12.879
Ryan Reynolds, I really haven't seen him in anything other than deadpool this and then like some

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:14.380
romantic comedies

00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:15.020
I

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:16.790
Think I didn't see green lantern

00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:20.680
Think cody and I are going to do a Tamra's never seen of Green Lantern soon. I think

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:24.189
I really enjoyed some of the acting in the movie. The chemistry between

00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:29.410
Samuel L. Jackson and Salma Hayek, and then Samuel L. Jackson and Ryan Reynolds really worked. I

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:37.749
Didn't find the chemistry between Ryan and his ex-wife to work very well, but I liked her in the film. How the story was very

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:42.669
"Blah!" Like it's fun. It's... it's an action movie. It's pretty

00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:47.170
There are definitely funny moments. This isn't a movie that you have to see in theaters

00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:51.009
I don't think? I think you could probably... I could watch this at home

00:07:51.010 --> 00:07:56.439
I think I would have enjoyed it more. I liked Ryan Reynolds in this I just his charm that he puts on

00:07:56.960 --> 00:08:02.650
Didn't really work for me in this. Versus where it soooo works in Deadpool

00:08:02.650 --> 00:08:07.299
And I think I'm being a little harsh on him as well. He's... I

00:08:08.030 --> 00:08:10.659
enjoy him on screen, but

00:08:11.690 --> 00:08:17.020
I don't know for some reason it just didn't connect with me in this one, and that's okay, that's fine

00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:22.480
Things happen. Oh, it's got a thirty five percent on rotten tomatoes, okay?

00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:29.379
Okay, that's good to see. I was worried. I was going a little harsh on it. It's okay

00:08:29.410 --> 00:08:32.200
It's an ok film like I said watch it at home

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:39.160
I don't think you need to go out to the theaters to see this one the best part of it is watching Samuel  L. Jackson who

00:08:39.830 --> 00:08:45.850
really hits his character well, kind of interact with other people in the film. There's some really funny things with

00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:50.809
authority figures that he kind of clashes heads with  and

00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:54.920
It's really good. I really enjoyed him in this. Next week

00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:58.639
I'm also going to be solo, and I have no idea what to watch

00:08:58.970 --> 00:09:00.590
There's not many movies coming out next week

00:09:00.590 --> 00:09:05.869
let me know in the comments if you think that I should visit something that I missed Valerian or or

00:09:07.950 --> 00:09:09.950
I almost said valkyrie

00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:12.140
Dunkirk (is what I meant)

00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:14.840
And let me know what you want to see next week

00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:17.780
Regarding Tamra's just saw

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:22.999
Also, Tamra's never seen I need help on all fronts everyone. Check out my Twitter

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.600
I put polls up for series like Tamra's just saw and Tamara's Never-

00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:30.650
I just said Tamara's Just Saw and Tamara's Never Seen

00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:36.980
Tamara Just Saw and Tamara's Never Seen. Tamara, Tamara, Tamara...

00:09:38.490 --> 00:09:40.490

00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:44.960
