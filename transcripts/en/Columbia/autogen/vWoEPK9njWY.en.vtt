neoliberalism as it applied to Africa
 

00:34:23.890 --> 00:34:27.450
neoliberalism as it applied to Africa
started from diagnosis of the African

00:34:27.450 --> 00:34:27.460
started from diagnosis of the African
 

00:34:27.460 --> 00:34:31.020
started from diagnosis of the African
economic problem in the 70s the

00:34:31.020 --> 00:34:31.030
economic problem in the 70s the
 

00:34:31.030 --> 00:34:37.260
economic problem in the 70s the
diagnosis was based on the assumption

00:34:37.260 --> 00:34:37.270
diagnosis was based on the assumption
 

00:34:37.270 --> 00:34:41.400
diagnosis was based on the assumption
that the problem in Africa was the

00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:41.410
that the problem in Africa was the
 

00:34:41.410 --> 00:34:44.940
that the problem in Africa was the
African state that the African state was

00:34:44.940 --> 00:34:44.950
African state that the African state was
 

00:34:44.950 --> 00:34:48.000

00:34:52.170 --> 00:34:52.180
should not be of its concern and that is
 

00:34:52.180 --> 00:34:55.140
should not be of its concern and that is
the reason why Africa was not making

00:34:55.140 --> 00:34:55.150
the reason why Africa was not making
 

00:34:55.150 --> 00:34:59.300
the reason why Africa was not making
progress so the solution to that problem

00:34:59.300 --> 00:34:59.310
progress so the solution to that problem
 

00:34:59.310 --> 00:35:03.600
progress so the solution to that problem
was to keep the African state small weak

00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:03.610
was to keep the African state small weak
 

00:35:03.610 --> 00:35:10.310
was to keep the African state small weak
and out of economic interference and so

00:35:10.310 --> 00:35:10.320
and out of economic interference and so
 

00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:13.770
and out of economic interference and so

second period is the beginning of the

second period is the beginning of the
 

00:36:26.580 --> 00:36:28.370
second period is the beginning of the
21st century where countries such as

00:36:28.370 --> 00:36:28.380
21st century where countries such as
 

00:36:28.380 --> 00:36:31.010
21st century where countries such as
India and China also needed these

to culinary so and so they invested in

00:36:38.390 --> 00:36:38.400
to culinary so and so they invested in
 

00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:40.190
to culinary so and so they invested in
infrastructure in a very different

00:36:40.190 --> 00:36:40.200
infrastructure in a very different
 

00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:44.360
infrastructure in a very different
manner so it's only at the beginning of

00:36:44.360 --> 00:36:44.370
manner so it's only at the beginning of
 

00:36:44.370 --> 00:36:46.070
manner so it's only at the beginning of
the 21st century with the emergence of

00:36:46.070 --> 00:36:46.080
the 21st century with the emergence of
 

00:36:46.080 --> 00:36:48.620
the 21st century with the emergence of
new powers that we have investment in

00:36:48.620 --> 00:36:48.630
new powers that we have investment in
 

00:36:48.630 --> 00:36:50.420
new powers that we have investment in
infrastructure and without that that

00:36:50.420 --> 00:36:50.430
infrastructure and without that that
 

00:36:50.430 --> 00:36:53.410
infrastructure and without that that
cannot be across so the bottom line is

00:36:53.410 --> 00:36:53.420
cannot be across so the bottom line is
 

00:36:53.420 --> 00:36:56.870
cannot be across so the bottom line is
the idea of me liberalism that we oppose

00:36:56.870 --> 00:36:56.880
the idea of me liberalism that we oppose
 

00:36:56.880 --> 00:37:01.310
the idea of me liberalism that we oppose
is that it does not allow the state to

00:37:01.310 --> 00:37:01.320
is that it does not allow the state to
 

00:37:01.320 --> 00:37:05.180
is that it does not allow the state to
play positive and active role in

00:37:05.180 --> 00:37:05.190

Ethiopian bird has been devalued
significantly does this develop this

00:38:15.400 --> 00:38:15.410
significantly does this develop this

devaluation is meant to promote import

00:38:19.239 --> 00:38:19.249
devaluation is meant to promote import
 

00:38:19.249 --> 00:38:24.729
devaluation is meant to promote import

model of agricultural LED economy spot
 

00:38:28.489 --> 00:38:33.099
model of agricultural LED economy spot
or something's wrong with it

00:38:33.099 --> 00:38:33.109
 

00:38:33.109 --> 00:38:36.910
you're right we have had a steep

00:38:36.910 --> 00:38:36.920
you're right we have had a steep
 

00:38:36.920 --> 00:38:39.009

devaluation of our currency in recent

00:38:39.009 --> 00:38:39.019
devaluation of our currency in recent

devaluation of our currency in recent
weeks there are a number of reasons for

00:38:42.910 --> 00:38:42.920
weeks there are a number of reasons for
 

00:38:42.920 --> 00:38:45.670
weeks there are a number of reasons for
it the first and most important reason

00:38:45.670 --> 00:38:45.680
it the first and most important reason
 

00:38:45.680 --> 00:38:50.799
it the first and most important reason
is that we have had again double-digit

00:38:50.799 --> 00:38:50.809
is that we have had again double-digit
 

00:38:50.809 --> 00:38:53.829
is that we have had again double-digit
inflation rates for more than two years

00:38:53.829 --> 00:38:53.839
inflation rates for more than two years
 

00:38:53.839 --> 00:38:57.519
inflation rates for more than two years
now and that clearly has demanded the

00:38:57.519 --> 00:38:57.529
now and that clearly has demanded the
 

00:38:57.529 --> 00:39:00.489
now and that clearly has demanded the
house

00:39:00.489 --> 00:39:00.499
 

00:39:00.499 --> 00:39:05.299
that needs to be corrected so we

00:39:05.299 --> 00:39:05.309
that needs to be corrected so we
 

00:39:05.309 --> 00:39:08.690
that needs to be corrected so we
devalued to correct the overvaluation of

00:39:08.690 --> 00:39:08.700
devalued to correct the overvaluation of
 

00:39:08.700 --> 00:39:11.989
devalued to correct the overvaluation of
our currency that came about as a result

00:39:11.989 --> 00:39:11.999
our currency that came about as a result
 

00:39:11.999 --> 00:39:15.289
our currency that came about as a result
of the high inflation we have had for

00:39:15.289 --> 00:39:15.299
of the high inflation we have had for
 

00:39:15.299 --> 00:39:17.509
of the high inflation we have had for
more than two years we needed to correct

00:39:17.509 --> 00:39:17.519
more than two years we needed to correct
 

00:39:17.519 --> 00:39:19.880
more than two years we needed to correct
them and we need to correct that in a

00:39:19.880 --> 00:39:19.890
them and we need to correct that in a
 

00:39:19.890 --> 00:39:22.819
them and we need to correct that in a
step-by-step manner we couldn't do much

00:39:22.819 --> 00:39:22.829
step-by-step manner we couldn't do much
 

00:39:22.829 --> 00:39:25.640
step-by-step manner we couldn't do much
when we were in high in a period of high

00:39:25.640 --> 00:39:25.650
when we were in high in a period of high
 

00:39:25.650 --> 00:39:28.190
when we were in high in a period of high
inflation because the devaluation might

00:39:28.190 --> 00:39:28.200
inflation because the devaluation might
 

00:39:28.200 --> 00:39:32.719
inflation because the devaluation might
have triggered even higher inflation so

00:39:32.719 --> 00:39:32.729
have triggered even higher inflation so
 

00:39:32.729 --> 00:39:34.940
have triggered even higher inflation so
we have to delay the devaluation and

00:39:34.940 --> 00:39:34.950
we have to delay the devaluation and
 

00:39:34.950 --> 00:39:40.099
we have to delay the devaluation and
exact time as we could safely do it and

00:39:40.099 --> 00:39:40.109
exact time as we could safely do it and
 

00:39:40.109 --> 00:39:42.880
exact time as we could safely do it and
we felt it's time now for us to safely

00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:42.890
we felt it's time now for us to safely
 

00:39:42.890 --> 00:39:46.400
we felt it's time now for us to safely
develop our currency to correct our

00:39:46.400 --> 00:39:46.410
develop our currency to correct our
 

00:39:46.410 --> 00:39:48.559
develop our currency to correct our
valuation that article is a few years

00:39:48.559 --> 00:39:48.569
valuation that article is a few years
 

00:39:48.569 --> 00:39:51.410
valuation that article is a few years
before the this is the main reason the

00:39:51.410 --> 00:39:51.420
before the this is the main reason the
 

00:39:51.420 --> 00:39:54.859
before the this is the main reason the
second reason is to promote exports and

00:39:54.859 --> 00:39:54.869
second reason is to promote exports and
 

00:39:54.869 --> 00:39:57.799
second reason is to promote exports and
as you might know our industrial and

00:39:57.799 --> 00:39:57.809
as you might know our industrial and
 

00:39:57.809 --> 00:39:59.890
as you might know our industrial and
economic development started as a whole

00:39:59.890 --> 00:39:59.900
economic development started as a whole
 

00:39:59.900 --> 00:40:04.549
economic development started as a whole
is one of export led development whether

00:40:04.549 --> 00:40:04.559
is one of export led development whether
 

00:40:04.559 --> 00:40:07.660
is one of export led development whether
it's in agriculture or in

00:40:07.660 --> 00:40:07.670
it's in agriculture or in
 

00:40:07.670 --> 00:40:11.079
it's in agriculture or in
and secondly while supporting exports we

00:40:11.079 --> 00:40:11.089
and secondly while supporting exports we
 

00:40:11.089 --> 00:40:15.359
and secondly while supporting exports we
also hope that the devaluation will push

00:40:15.359 --> 00:40:15.369
also hope that the devaluation will push
 

00:40:15.369 --> 00:40:20.109
also hope that the devaluation will push
import substitution forward we I would

00:40:20.109 --> 00:40:20.119
import substitution forward we I would
 

00:40:20.119 --> 00:40:22.359
import substitution forward we I would
argue that this is consistent with our

00:40:22.359 --> 00:40:22.369
argue that this is consistent with our
 

00:40:22.369 --> 00:40:26.050
argue that this is consistent with our
strategy but I can understand why people

00:40:26.050 --> 00:40:26.060
strategy but I can understand why people
 

00:40:26.060 --> 00:40:30.370
strategy but I can understand why people
would think that this may be midterm

00:40:30.370 --> 00:40:30.380
would think that this may be midterm
 

00:40:30.380 --> 00:40:33.250
would think that this may be midterm
correction on our own alpha but my

00:40:33.250 --> 00:40:33.260
correction on our own alpha but my
 

00:40:33.260 --> 00:40:34.359
correction on our own alpha but my
argument would be that it would be

00:40:34.359 --> 00:40:34.369
argument would be that it would be
 

00:40:34.369 --> 00:40:39.400
argument would be that it would be
consistent with our Stern
