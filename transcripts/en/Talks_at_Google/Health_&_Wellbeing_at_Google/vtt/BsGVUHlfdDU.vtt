[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.214 --> 00:00:07.773
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:07.773 --> 00:00:08.940
KATI MORTON: Hey, everybody.

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.630
Thank you so much
for having me here.

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:13.460
Like Laura said, we'll
be taking questions.

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:15.502
So if anything that I'm
saying doesn't make sense

00:00:15.502 --> 00:00:17.760
or you want follow
ups, just let me know.

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.040
But the thing that I
want to start off with,

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:20.510
whenever I do talks
like this, I always

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:22.927
want to make sure that we're
talking about the same thing.

00:00:22.927 --> 00:00:26.750
Because people talk a lot about
mental health now, and nobody

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:28.820
really defines what that means.

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.150
If you were to think about
if, I just asked you,

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:33.400
does anybody know the
difference between mental health

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.200
and mental illness,
we might not know.

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.010
And that's OK.

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.552
No judgments.

00:00:37.552 --> 00:00:39.385
I bet if I wasn't a
therapist, I would never

00:00:39.385 --> 00:00:40.710
have even thought about that.

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.645
But the difference
between mental health

00:00:42.645 --> 00:00:45.020
and mental illness, I think,
is really, really important.

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:47.900
And I'll start off by talking a
little bit about mental health.

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:50.610
And mental health is just
like physical health.

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:51.930
We all have it.

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.670
It's something that
we can take care of.

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.040
If I'm sleeping
well, eating well,

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.923
I'm engaging with my
friends and family,

00:00:58.923 --> 00:01:00.590
I'm doing all the
self care that I need.

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:01.730
Maybe that's taking walks.

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:03.813
Maybe that's playing for
my children or an animal.

00:01:03.813 --> 00:01:06.100
Maybe that's coloring,
journaling, you name it.

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.040
I'm doing all of that stuff.

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.440
And then I feel really good.

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.480
I start to feel
pretty happy, and I'm

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:13.730
able to do all that I
need to do every day.

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:15.470
That's when we have
a good mental health.

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:17.880
And I wrote down the definition.

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.940
And that is, "It's
a person's condition

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:22.520
with regard to their
psychological and emotional

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:23.870
well-being."

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:26.690
So that's mental health.

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:29.180
Then on the flip
side, mental illness,

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:31.670
because I like to compare
this to our physical health

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:32.930
and physical illness.

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:36.560
So mental illness is like
when we catch a cold.

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.250
It's like we may be
really tired one day.

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:42.250
And then I kind of feel sweaty.

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:43.952
And then I'm just not sure.

00:01:43.952 --> 00:01:44.910
Then I maybe [COUGHS]--

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:46.102
I get a cough.

00:01:46.102 --> 00:01:47.810
And before I know it,
I'm laid up in bed.

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.870
And I can't do all that
I need to do every day.

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:55.290
You have to drink water, take
your medicine, need to sleep.

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.180
And mental illness
really is no different.

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.530
And mental illness is when
our mental health deteriorates

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.470
to the point that we
can't do everything

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:05.370
that we need to do in a day.

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:08.060
And that's really how we talk
about it between mental health

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.460
professionals, just
about functionality.

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:12.080
So considering
maybe, like Laura was

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.030
saying, having a tough
time in her life,

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.060
considering how I was doing
before that tough time.

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.280
What was I able to do then?

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:20.570
What time did I get up?

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:22.580
How restful was my sleep?

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:24.170
How did I feel during the day?

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.470
Was I able to function, focus
during work the whole time?

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.300
Or was it really
difficult for me,

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:32.780
and I struggled to stay focused
and to complete all the tasks?

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.490
And so just keep that in mind
as we talk about these things,

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:36.740
like knowing when to get help.

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:37.680
We're going to get into that.

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.620
But mental health is
something we all have,

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.300
we can all take care of.

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:42.680
And when we're
really struggling,

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.000
it can become a mental illness.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.933
And there's no
judgment on either end.

00:02:45.933 --> 00:02:48.350
You wouldn't judge someone if
they got the flu, would you,

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:51.200
and be like, man, you should
have just, like, I don't know--

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.130
slept more, smiled
more, maybe take a sh--

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.630
no.

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:55.005
You'd just be
like, oh, it sucks.

00:02:55.005 --> 00:02:56.450
I was sick last week, and bleh.

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:57.680
It's been going around.

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:58.820
And don't think mental
illness is something

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:59.940
you can catch from people.

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:01.482
That's not what I'm
trying to get at.

00:03:01.482 --> 00:03:04.580
I'm just saying that we
can struggle to function,

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:06.080
and mental health
and mental illness

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.860
are no different than physical
health and physical illness.

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:12.890
Now, the question that I
get a lot on my channel

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:16.430
just in general
is, how do I know

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:18.560
if my mental illness
or my mental health

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.777
struggles warrant getting
professional help?

00:03:20.777 --> 00:03:22.610
I think a lot of us are
scared to reach out,

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:24.860
like ooh, am I "sick enough?"

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:26.360
I get a lot of
questions about that,

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:30.500
like how sick do I need
to be to call someone?

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.625
How sick do I have to be to see
a psychiatrist, or a therapist?

00:03:33.625 --> 00:03:35.632
A psychiatrist being
a medical doctor

00:03:35.632 --> 00:03:36.840
who can prescribe medication.

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.270
A therapist is
someone like myself

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:40.490
that I'm like, how does
that make you feel?

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:42.200
That's the difference.

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:47.330
But how bad does it have to
be before we see someone?

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:48.770
Not bad at all.

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:51.385
I truly believe that all of
us can benefit from therapy.

00:03:51.385 --> 00:03:52.760
I personally have
been in therapy

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:56.377
off and on since I was
probably 15 years old.

00:03:56.377 --> 00:03:58.460
And that's really just
because it's helpful for me

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:59.630
to get another perspective.

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:01.205
Sometimes I want to cry.

00:04:01.205 --> 00:04:02.330
Sometimes I want to scream.

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:04.288
Sometimes I want to cuss
about something that's

00:04:04.288 --> 00:04:06.920
going on like, oh, I'm so mad.

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:08.722
And I just need
someone to not judge me

00:04:08.722 --> 00:04:10.430
and to know that they
can't tell anybody.

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:12.360
That can be really
powerful, too.

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:15.065
And so know that we can
all benefit from therapy

00:04:15.065 --> 00:04:17.190
and seeing a mental health
professional at anytime.

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:18.857
If you're ever just
feeling overwhelmed,

00:04:18.857 --> 00:04:20.779
you're feeling maxed
out, see someone.

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:22.250
I promise, we're nice people.

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:25.920
We're not weird, and we're
normal people just like you.

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:26.808
So don't be scared.

00:04:26.808 --> 00:04:28.850
But I know that most of
you aren't really worried

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:29.460
about that.

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:32.330
We all know it's
good to see somebody.

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:34.633
But how bad does it have to be?

00:04:34.633 --> 00:04:36.050
Because I know
some of us are just

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:38.172
white knuckling life, just
trying to get through.

00:04:38.172 --> 00:04:39.630
And you guys work
really hard here.

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:40.213
I know you do.

00:04:40.213 --> 00:04:43.910
So how bad does it have to be?

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:46.880
Back to what I said about mental
health and mental illness.

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:50.430
If you're not able to function
in your life in some capacity,

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:52.430
because we have a lot of
different hats we wear.

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:55.030
There's the hat we wear at
work when we're a professional.

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:57.238
Then we get home, and there's
this other hat we wear,

00:04:57.238 --> 00:05:00.440
that could be roommate, spouse,
mom, dad, brother, sister.

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:02.360
It could be all sorts of things.

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:04.820
So are any of these
parts of your life

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:07.310
just not what they used to be?

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:09.140
Maybe I can't show
up for my friends

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:10.765
the way I used to
when we go to dinner.

00:05:10.765 --> 00:05:11.760
I just can't focus.

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:12.830
I'm not even listening to them.

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:14.580
I'm thinking about the
stuff I have to do,

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:16.970
or I'm stressing about this
thing at work or something

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:17.250
else.

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:18.875
If we're not able to
show up for people

00:05:18.875 --> 00:05:20.600
and participate
in relationships,

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:22.080
that could be a sign.

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:23.900
We might need to
see a professional.

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:27.170
Let's say I used to
enjoy going for walks,

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:28.670
or working out, or
petting animals.

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:30.390
And I just don't anymore.

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:32.300
It all just seems
like so much work.

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:34.100
I have had days where
even showering just

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:35.210
feels like too much.

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:35.970
Anybody else?

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:38.400
Where you're like, wow, that
seems like a lot of work.

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:40.700
I don't think I have the energy.

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:41.730
So just pay attention.

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:43.250
If you have more
of these days where

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:45.360
the things that you used
to do you just can't do,

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:47.960
and you just don't
feel like yourself,

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:50.090
that's when I would
reach out speak up.

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:52.828
Look into seeing someone.

00:05:52.828 --> 00:05:54.870
Make sure I'm not forgetting
anything we're good.

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:56.550
We're good.

00:05:56.550 --> 00:06:00.020
But then the next thing,
so we decided that maybe we

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:01.490
are struggling a little bit.

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:02.750
We don't feel like ourselves.

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:05.300
We aren't able to focus at
work, or we're not showing up

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:06.680
for our friends or family.

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:08.810
And we're going to see somebody.

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:11.020
Like that's not hard
enough to already decide.

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:13.000
But then there's a
question of, well,

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.583
what makes a good therapist?

00:06:14.583 --> 00:06:16.250
How do I know if
they're garbage or not?

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:17.810
Maybe they're terrible,
and I don't even know.

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:18.890
Or maybe they're great.

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:22.310
How do I know who I should
see or what to look for?

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:24.060
A lot of people have
questions about that.

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:26.490
And I think the
[AUDIO OUT] Uh-oh.

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:27.550
Oh, I'm back.

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:30.760
I think the reason that we have
those questions and problems is

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:32.530
because nobody talks about it.

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:35.080
Nobody says like, oh, this is
what a good therapist is like,

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:38.650
or these are the questions you
should ask of your therapist.

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:40.960
This is how it should
work with the relationship

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:42.340
that you have with them.

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:44.590
And so I want to go
through a few of the ways

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:46.942
to know if you're
seeing a bad therapist.

00:06:46.942 --> 00:06:48.400
And then we'll get
into how to know

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:51.010
you're seeing a good therapist,
because it's not always

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:52.445
just the flip of the other.

00:06:52.445 --> 00:06:53.320
But some of them are.

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:54.220
You'll see.

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:57.290
So there are eight signs that
you're seeing a bad therapist.

00:06:57.290 --> 00:06:59.290
And I know that already
sounds way overwhelming,

00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:02.120
but I promise it
totally make sense.

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:04.870
So the first is if they don't
remember important details

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:06.090
about you.

00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:07.630
And I know that
goes without saying,

00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:11.040
but they should
remember your name.

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:11.540
I'm sorry.

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:13.832
I've had viewers of mine tell
me they've had therapists

00:07:13.832 --> 00:07:15.700
repeatedly call them
by the incorrect name.

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:16.780
Like let's say
your name was Paul,

00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:18.072
and they keep calling you Pete.

00:07:18.072 --> 00:07:21.275
And you're like, how many
times do I have to correct you?

00:07:21.275 --> 00:07:22.900
They should remember
important details.

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:25.360
And obviously, it might take
a couple of sessions for them

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:28.030
to get an idea or remember
that your mom's name is Judy

00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:30.790
and your dad's name is Steve.

00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:32.180
But after they've asked things--

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:33.730
I mean, we have
notepads and laptops.

00:07:33.730 --> 00:07:35.290
We should be writing
that stuff down.

00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:37.930
Trust me, I still
take old school notes.

00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:39.610
But they should
remember those details

00:07:39.610 --> 00:07:42.395
because not only is it just part
of getting to know somebody.

00:07:42.395 --> 00:07:44.020
You wouldn't meet a
new friend and then

00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:46.353
six months in, you're like,
hey, what's your name again?

00:07:46.353 --> 00:07:47.510
I forget.

00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:49.083
That'd be so rude.

00:07:49.083 --> 00:07:50.500
So it shouldn't
happen in therapy.

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:52.510
But they should
also be able to keep

00:07:52.510 --> 00:07:54.910
track of people in your life
and things you're doing.

00:07:54.910 --> 00:07:57.755
It's just part of that
relationship building.

00:07:57.755 --> 00:07:59.380
And so if you have
to repeatedly remind

00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:01.570
them of why you're
there, what you

00:08:01.570 --> 00:08:05.950
do for a living, your name,
your spouse's name, or your best

00:08:05.950 --> 00:08:08.310
friend, or roommate,
you might want

00:08:08.310 --> 00:08:10.810
to consider seeing someone else
that's a little more present

00:08:10.810 --> 00:08:12.841
and there with you.

00:08:12.841 --> 00:08:14.942
And the second sign--

00:08:14.942 --> 00:08:16.400
and this is one
that happens a lot,

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:18.010
and this is why I
really think it's

00:08:18.010 --> 00:08:20.635
important we hear this-- is that
they spend the session talking

00:08:20.635 --> 00:08:22.640
about themselves.

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:25.000
I know that sounds
weird, but if I'm

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.140
in session with a client,
that's not my time.

00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:28.360
You know what is my time?

00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:30.970
My own therapy
session, because that's

00:08:30.970 --> 00:08:32.450
where I get to
work my stuff out.

00:08:32.450 --> 00:08:34.030
I don't work it
out on your time.

00:08:34.030 --> 00:08:37.090
That's 50 minutes for
you, the only 50 minutes

00:08:37.090 --> 00:08:39.190
most of my patients
get each and every week

00:08:39.190 --> 00:08:40.755
that's just about them.

00:08:40.755 --> 00:08:42.130
And so if you find
your therapist

00:08:42.130 --> 00:08:44.890
sharing a lot about
themselves and taking up

00:08:44.890 --> 00:08:47.230
25 minutes where you can't
get a word in edgewise,

00:08:47.230 --> 00:08:48.772
and they're like,
oh, that reminds me

00:08:48.772 --> 00:08:51.550
of that time with
my sister, eh, no.

00:08:51.550 --> 00:08:53.140
That is not a good therapist.

00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:55.385
They should be doing that
in their own therapy.

00:08:55.385 --> 00:08:57.010
The only time a
therapist should really

00:08:57.010 --> 00:09:01.240
ever share much about themselves
is when it helps you better

00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:03.280
understand or empathize.

00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:05.590
Like for example, I
had a patient recently

00:09:05.590 --> 00:09:07.990
whose dad got really sick.

00:09:07.990 --> 00:09:11.812
And I lost my own dad to a
heart attack when I was 24.

00:09:11.812 --> 00:09:14.020
And so I briefly just said,
I know what this is like.

00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:15.730
I've been through that, too.

00:09:15.730 --> 00:09:16.420
And that was it.

00:09:16.420 --> 00:09:18.440
I didn't share a lot
about what was going on

00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:19.940
or how that had
happened in my life.

00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:22.280
But I just wanted him to
know that I've been there.

00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:23.050
And that was it.

00:09:23.050 --> 00:09:24.600
So maybe a couple of minutes.

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:27.100
And that's the only time I've
ever shared anything personal.

00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:28.630
So just consider
that in therapy, too.

00:09:28.630 --> 00:09:30.463
Are they sharing a lot
about their own life?

00:09:30.463 --> 00:09:33.070
And you're like, I know
way too much about them.

00:09:33.070 --> 00:09:34.720
You really, as
weird as it sounds,

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:37.527
shouldn't know that much
about your therapist.

00:09:37.527 --> 00:09:38.610
It's a weird relationship.

00:09:38.610 --> 00:09:39.680
It's all about you.

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:43.370
It's not about me, and we
want to keep it that way.

00:09:43.370 --> 00:09:47.040
Now, the third red flag or sign
you're seeing a bad therapist

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:50.140
is that they
downplay your issues.

00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:51.917
A therapist's whole job--

00:09:51.917 --> 00:09:53.500
this is going to
sound really strange.

00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:54.670
But when we're in
school, they teach

00:09:54.670 --> 00:09:56.753
us like, when you're putting
your office together,

00:09:56.753 --> 00:09:59.350
think of it like a warm
holding environment, which

00:09:59.350 --> 00:10:00.630
I know sounds really creepy.

00:10:00.630 --> 00:10:01.630
You're like what?

00:10:01.630 --> 00:10:03.730
But you just want people
to feel comfortable.

00:10:03.730 --> 00:10:07.390
You want people to feel
validated, heard, understood.

00:10:07.390 --> 00:10:10.270
That's really important, because
we know when you go to therapy,

00:10:10.270 --> 00:10:12.730
you talk about things that
maybe you don't tell everybody.

00:10:12.730 --> 00:10:14.470
And you are a little
worried about it.

00:10:14.470 --> 00:10:16.390
And you're just ugh.

00:10:16.390 --> 00:10:17.450
It's uncomfortable.

00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:18.530
We're being vulnerable.

00:10:18.530 --> 00:10:19.990
That's hard.

00:10:19.990 --> 00:10:21.828
So your therapist
shouldn't downplay

00:10:21.828 --> 00:10:22.870
what's going on with you.

00:10:22.870 --> 00:10:24.578
They shouldn't say
like, oh, don't worry.

00:10:24.578 --> 00:10:28.258
You just have depression, or
like, ah, it's just grief.

00:10:28.258 --> 00:10:29.560
Meh.

00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:32.380
I heard really loud and
clear from my audience once.

00:10:32.380 --> 00:10:33.970
I had a guest on my channel.

00:10:33.970 --> 00:10:34.880
This was years ago.

00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:38.050
And they said something
about like, I just self-harm.

00:10:38.050 --> 00:10:39.830
And they were downplaying
their own stuff.

00:10:39.830 --> 00:10:41.410
And I was like, no, no.

00:10:41.410 --> 00:10:43.527
It's your issue, and it's
important, and it's big.

00:10:43.527 --> 00:10:45.610
And it's something that
we're going to talk about.

00:10:45.610 --> 00:10:46.460
And they loved that.

00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:48.835
And they were like, because
a lot of people will say just

00:10:48.835 --> 00:10:49.410
or only.

00:10:49.410 --> 00:10:53.080
And it makes me feel like I
have to prove how sick I am.

00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:55.180
Going back to that like,
am I worthy of help?

00:10:55.180 --> 00:10:57.490
How sick do I have
to be to get help?

00:10:57.490 --> 00:10:59.140
So a therapist
should never make you

00:10:59.140 --> 00:11:01.180
feel like you have
to prove that you

00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:03.820
deserve to be there, because
we all deserve to get help.

00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:06.330
Every issue is a
big enough issue.

00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:08.050
And so make sure
that your therapist

00:11:08.050 --> 00:11:09.670
helps you feel that way.

00:11:09.670 --> 00:11:11.110
You feel validated.

00:11:11.110 --> 00:11:11.787
You feel heard.

00:11:11.787 --> 00:11:13.870
You feel understood, because
you're all important.

00:11:13.870 --> 00:11:18.400
And therapy is the one place
you should really feel that.

00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:21.160
The fourth sign is that
a therapist shouldn't be

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:23.460
accessible to you at all times.

00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:25.940
And even when I told Laura,
I mentioned this, she's like,

00:11:25.940 --> 00:11:27.290
why is that one important?

00:11:27.290 --> 00:11:29.682
And I'm like, it really
is because boundaries.

00:11:29.682 --> 00:11:31.640
And I know boundaries is
such a therapist word.

00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:33.765
And you're like, I don't
even know what that means.

00:11:33.765 --> 00:11:37.830
But the whole goal of therapy
is for you to do it on your own.

00:11:37.830 --> 00:11:38.595
It's like fly.

00:11:38.595 --> 00:11:40.220
We've learned all
these tools together.

00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:41.900
Go out, and do them on your own.

00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:43.852
And so if you have a
therapist that's on tap,

00:11:43.852 --> 00:11:44.810
like I'm going to call.

00:11:44.810 --> 00:11:45.290
I'm going to email.

00:11:45.290 --> 00:11:46.290
I'm going to check in with you.

00:11:46.290 --> 00:11:47.210
I can get feedback.

00:11:47.210 --> 00:11:49.252
I'm going to text in the
moment, and you're going

00:11:49.252 --> 00:11:50.760
to tell me what I should do.

00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:52.165
Then I don't know.

00:11:52.165 --> 00:11:53.540
It's almost like
going to the gym

00:11:53.540 --> 00:11:55.853
and having your trainer
lift the weights for you.

00:11:55.853 --> 00:11:57.770
And then you're just
standing off to the side.

00:11:57.770 --> 00:11:59.150
And you're like, yeah,
I'm feeling so buff.

00:11:59.150 --> 00:11:59.810
Whoo!

00:11:59.810 --> 00:12:01.860
But you're really
not doing the work.

00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:03.600
It just doesn't work like that.

00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:06.200
And yes, a therapist should
be accessible for emergencies

00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:08.102
and changing, to
reschedule an appointment

00:12:08.102 --> 00:12:09.060
or something like that.

00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:12.475
But for the most part, you're
on your own between sessions.

00:12:12.475 --> 00:12:13.850
And that's the
time where you get

00:12:13.850 --> 00:12:15.560
to practice all you've learned.

00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:18.110
And I think that that's a
really key part of therapy,

00:12:18.110 --> 00:12:21.420
so that we don't depend on
our therapist for everything.

00:12:21.420 --> 00:12:24.260
And it's OK to want to and
to think that you should.

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:26.568
But a therapist should
say, no, we'll talk.

00:12:26.568 --> 00:12:27.860
I'm not going to answer emails.

00:12:27.860 --> 00:12:29.360
I'm not going to
respond unless it's

00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:32.270
an emergency, because that's
the time I want you to try.

00:12:32.270 --> 00:12:34.640
And they'll let you
know about that.

00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:36.650
So they should be
accessible 24/7.

00:12:36.650 --> 00:12:37.850
I'm sorry.

00:12:37.850 --> 00:12:39.110
We also have lives.

00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:41.600
Sorry about that, too.

00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:43.880
Then the fifth red
flag is that there

00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:46.820
is no end of therapy in sight.

00:12:46.820 --> 00:12:49.040
And I know, I get so
much crap for this online

00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:51.457
when I say this from other
therapists, which goes to show,

00:12:51.457 --> 00:12:53.540
it's why it's important
that we know these things.

00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:55.550
We know what to expect
and what a therapist

00:12:55.550 --> 00:12:56.960
should and shouldn't be.

00:12:56.960 --> 00:13:00.590
But the whole goal of therapy
is they don't need it anymore.

00:13:00.590 --> 00:13:03.420
You shouldn't have to be
in therapy your whole life.

00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:04.320
That's not the goal.

00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:07.040
The goal is to come in and
get help for a certain issue

00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:07.970
or upset.

00:13:07.970 --> 00:13:09.500
And then you have the tools,
and you feel empowered.

00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:10.550
And you go out, and you try.

00:13:10.550 --> 00:13:11.840
I mean, you do it on your own.

00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:13.790
And sure, you can come back.

00:13:13.790 --> 00:13:16.510
Like I said, I've been in and
out of therapy since I was 15.

00:13:16.510 --> 00:13:17.270
I'm 35.

00:13:17.270 --> 00:13:18.230
Don't tell anybody.

00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:20.510
But that's a long
time, and that's OK.

00:13:20.510 --> 00:13:22.740
But it's not something
that I'm doing constantly

00:13:22.740 --> 00:13:23.540
everyday all day.

00:13:23.540 --> 00:13:26.300
It shouldn't be something that
I am looking with my therapist,

00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:27.770
and there's no real goals.

00:13:27.770 --> 00:13:31.610
We're just kind of hanging out,
have been chatting for years.

00:13:31.610 --> 00:13:34.508
That's not how therapy works.

00:13:34.508 --> 00:13:36.050
And the sixth red
sign-- don't worry.

00:13:36.050 --> 00:13:36.800
There's only two more.

00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:37.425
So don't worry.

00:13:37.425 --> 00:13:40.880
But the sixth red flag is
that they tell you what to do.

00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:42.800
And I know you just
got really bummed.

00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:44.260
You thought we were going
to fix all your problems.

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:46.010
You're going to come
in, and we'd be like,

00:13:46.010 --> 00:13:47.407
I have the magic solution.

00:13:47.407 --> 00:13:48.240
This is what you do.

00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:50.510
You tell your mom she's a jerk,
and you dump that boyfriend

00:13:50.510 --> 00:13:51.385
because he's a loser.

00:13:51.385 --> 00:13:52.890
And then everything's better.

00:13:52.890 --> 00:13:54.680
No.

00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:57.020
Sometimes we do need a
tough love kind of push

00:13:57.020 --> 00:13:59.790
from a therapist, but
it's not like that.

00:13:59.790 --> 00:14:02.197
We can't tell you what to
do, because there's this--

00:14:02.197 --> 00:14:03.530
I don't know how to describe it.

00:14:03.530 --> 00:14:05.340
But it's like a magical
part of therapy,

00:14:05.340 --> 00:14:09.260
even personally, where
I have this light bulb,

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:11.870
where I realize that I've
been doing the same thing over

00:14:11.870 --> 00:14:12.990
and over.

00:14:12.990 --> 00:14:16.610
And that's why I had all
these bad relationships

00:14:16.610 --> 00:14:17.570
for like 10 years.

00:14:17.570 --> 00:14:18.530
Awesome.

00:14:18.530 --> 00:14:20.870
Or I had this series
of friendships

00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:23.990
that just didn't work out, and
I could never figure out why.

00:14:23.990 --> 00:14:27.530
There's this magic to
figuring it out on your own

00:14:27.530 --> 00:14:32.180
and all of a sudden
thinking, I can change.

00:14:32.180 --> 00:14:33.350
I don't like that.

00:14:33.350 --> 00:14:34.880
That's why that's happening.

00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:37.490
And it's not only
validating, but it also

00:14:37.490 --> 00:14:40.010
gives us some sense
of empowerment,

00:14:40.010 --> 00:14:41.675
that we can make the
change ourselves.

00:14:41.675 --> 00:14:43.800
And if a therapist was just
to come in and be like,

00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:45.967
that's the problem, and
this is what you need to do,

00:14:45.967 --> 00:14:48.560
we might be a little
less likely to change.

00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:51.522
And we probably might even
look for another therapist,

00:14:51.522 --> 00:14:53.480
because we're like, wow,
that one's real pushy,

00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:55.910
pretends they know everything.

00:14:55.910 --> 00:14:57.840
It doesn't really work that way.

00:14:57.840 --> 00:14:59.060
So you shouldn't have
a therapist telling you

00:14:59.060 --> 00:14:59.880
exactly what to do.

00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:02.090
They should just ask
a lot of questions

00:15:02.090 --> 00:15:06.710
until you figure it
out as you answer them.

00:15:06.710 --> 00:15:11.535
Now, the seventh red flag
is that they should always--

00:15:11.535 --> 00:15:13.160
I guess the red flag
is that they don't

00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:14.580
make you feel like a priority.

00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:16.400
They keep rescheduling
appointments,

00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:17.593
not showing up for you.

00:15:17.593 --> 00:15:19.010
This could kind
of go hand-in-hand

00:15:19.010 --> 00:15:21.343
with them not remembering
your name and stuff like that.

00:15:21.343 --> 00:15:23.000
That just makes you
not feel important.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:24.650
And yeah, emergencies
happen, and therapists

00:15:24.650 --> 00:15:25.650
will have to reschedule.

00:15:25.650 --> 00:15:27.110
That's just part of what we do.

00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:28.830
And life is unpredictable.

00:15:28.830 --> 00:15:30.320
And I've had emergencies.

00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:32.410
I see a lot of eating
disorder patients

00:15:32.410 --> 00:15:33.480
and self-injury patients.

00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:36.320
And if there's a bad infection
because they've got cellulitis

00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:38.028
from a cut, I have to
go to the hospital.

00:15:38.028 --> 00:15:40.370
Or if they're suicidal, I
have to check up on them,

00:15:40.370 --> 00:15:42.578
and I might have to get them
in for an extra session.

00:15:42.578 --> 00:15:45.290
So things can happen,
and schedules can shift.

00:15:45.290 --> 00:15:47.180
But you should always
feel like a priority.

00:15:47.180 --> 00:15:49.430
For the most part, you should
be seeing your therapist

00:15:49.430 --> 00:15:52.500
with some regularity.

00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:53.750
And then the eighth and final.

00:15:53.750 --> 00:15:55.680
We're getting to the good
ones here in just a minute.

00:15:55.680 --> 00:15:58.097
But the eighth red flag that
you're seeing a bad therapist

00:15:58.097 --> 00:16:01.838
is that they don't give
you much, if any, feedback.

00:16:01.838 --> 00:16:03.380
And the reason that
this is important

00:16:03.380 --> 00:16:04.590
is because we can feel--

00:16:04.590 --> 00:16:06.590
at certain points in
therapy, even personally, I

00:16:06.590 --> 00:16:09.092
can feel like I'm just
stagnant, where you're like,

00:16:09.092 --> 00:16:10.550
I'm just going
through the motions.

00:16:10.550 --> 00:16:14.070
Just showing up, but I don't
know if I'm getting any better.

00:16:14.070 --> 00:16:16.580
And I don't know if this is
making me feel any better.

00:16:16.580 --> 00:16:18.080
And we can lose hope.

00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:20.540
Or it could just be
feeling really bad

00:16:20.540 --> 00:16:21.642
for that month maybe.

00:16:21.642 --> 00:16:22.850
Things are stressful at work.

00:16:22.850 --> 00:16:25.100
Maybe I had a fight
with my spouse.

00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:27.680
Maybe-- I don't know--
there's an extra project that

00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:29.610
just got lumped on top
of everything else.

00:16:29.610 --> 00:16:31.892
And then I found out I had
to move at the end of the--

00:16:31.892 --> 00:16:32.600
who knows, right?

00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:33.890
We can have all sorts
of things happen.

00:16:33.890 --> 00:16:35.473
So we can go through
these lulls where

00:16:35.473 --> 00:16:38.300
we just feel like
our worst self,

00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:41.360
but we should get feedback.

00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:43.190
And they should show
us how far we've come.

00:16:43.190 --> 00:16:45.470
Sometimes it can be really,
really powerful in therapy

00:16:45.470 --> 00:16:47.840
to look back and be
like, hey, two weeks ago,

00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:51.760
I thought that I'd never finish
that and do OK, but I did.

00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:54.660
And we can forget all
the progress we've made.

00:16:54.660 --> 00:16:55.645
We have a tendency--

00:16:55.645 --> 00:16:57.020
I even personally
have a tendency

00:16:57.020 --> 00:16:59.310
to do the black and white
thinking, where you're like,

00:16:59.310 --> 00:17:00.290
I'm doing so great.

00:17:00.290 --> 00:17:03.560
And then one trip up, and you're
like, oh, throw in the towel.

00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:05.390
It's over.

00:17:05.390 --> 00:17:07.015
And by a therapist
giving you feedback,

00:17:07.015 --> 00:17:09.098
that lets you know that,
hey, I am moving forward.

00:17:09.098 --> 00:17:09.980
I am making progress.

00:17:09.980 --> 00:17:12.313
And it can just make us feel
that little bit better when

00:17:12.313 --> 00:17:15.260
we maybe are stuck in that rut.

00:17:17.911 --> 00:17:18.619
So that's enough.

00:17:18.619 --> 00:17:20.970
Those are the things you
don't want in a therapist.

00:17:20.970 --> 00:17:22.535
You don't want
them to ignore you.

00:17:22.535 --> 00:17:23.910
Don't want them
forget your name.

00:17:23.910 --> 00:17:25.145
You don't want them to
tell you the therapy

00:17:25.145 --> 00:17:26.650
is going to last forever.

00:17:26.650 --> 00:17:28.730
But the things that
you do want, five signs

00:17:28.730 --> 00:17:30.350
you're seeing a good therapist.

00:17:30.350 --> 00:17:32.270
The first is that
you feel like they're

00:17:32.270 --> 00:17:36.510
on your side rooting for you
and wanting you to do well.

00:17:36.510 --> 00:17:42.260
And I know that is hard to
actually see and tangibly grab,

00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:43.700
but it's really that feeling.

00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:45.200
You know when you
meet a new person?

00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:47.670
And you're like, I don't
know why, but I like them.

00:17:47.670 --> 00:17:50.660
I don't really know why, but
I think we could be friends.

00:17:50.660 --> 00:17:52.790
And you have that
first good feeling.

00:17:52.790 --> 00:17:54.950
It's kind of that
click that we call it,

00:17:54.950 --> 00:17:57.920
whether it's like friendships,
people we're trying to date,

00:17:57.920 --> 00:17:59.520
or whether it's a therapist.

00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:01.130
And so you should
have that click.

00:18:01.130 --> 00:18:02.750
You don't know much about them.

00:18:02.750 --> 00:18:03.710
You're just getting
to know them.

00:18:03.710 --> 00:18:05.460
Maybe you've seen them
two or three times,

00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:08.043
but you're like, I like you.

00:18:08.043 --> 00:18:09.710
And so we want that
with our therapists.

00:18:09.710 --> 00:18:12.043
We want to feel like they're
on our side rooting for us,

00:18:12.043 --> 00:18:13.650
because that's really
part of our job

00:18:13.650 --> 00:18:16.862
is just being like
your cheerleader.

00:18:16.862 --> 00:18:19.070
Then the second sign you're
seeing a good therapist--

00:18:19.070 --> 00:18:20.840
and this is really,
really important--

00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:25.140
is that they clearly communicate
with you about therapy.

00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:26.640
And I know that
sounds really silly,

00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:29.480
but the whole reason of what
I do and even talking here

00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:31.470
is because people don't
know about therapy.

00:18:31.470 --> 00:18:32.840
They don't know what to expect.

00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:34.170
How long are sessions?

00:18:34.170 --> 00:18:36.800
They're 50 minutes, mainly
because we have to pee and take

00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:38.610
notes and stuff in between.

00:18:38.610 --> 00:18:40.860
So how much does it cost?

00:18:40.860 --> 00:18:42.195
How long is it going to last?

00:18:42.195 --> 00:18:44.570
What are the treatment goals
we're going to put together?

00:18:44.570 --> 00:18:45.830
And they're not going
to know exactly how

00:18:45.830 --> 00:18:47.750
long it's going to last, but
you could at least ask that.

00:18:47.750 --> 00:18:48.890
And they should be
able to communicate

00:18:48.890 --> 00:18:51.140
that, we're going to work
together towards your goals.

00:18:51.140 --> 00:18:53.990
And, I don't know, we'll check
in in three months or something

00:18:53.990 --> 00:18:54.860
like that.

00:18:54.860 --> 00:18:58.370
They should communicate with
you what you need to prepare.

00:18:58.370 --> 00:18:59.450
Do they take insurance?

00:18:59.450 --> 00:19:00.992
There's all sorts
of random questions

00:19:00.992 --> 00:19:02.030
that we might not know.

00:19:02.030 --> 00:19:03.863
And so it's really
important for a therapist

00:19:03.863 --> 00:19:06.530
to talk you through
what you can expect

00:19:06.530 --> 00:19:08.360
so that there's no surprises.

00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:09.860
Because I know,
even as a therapist,

00:19:09.860 --> 00:19:13.550
something that we do
sometimes is we forget all

00:19:13.550 --> 00:19:15.170
that we know, just like--

00:19:15.170 --> 00:19:17.210
trust me-- you guys
have acronyms and things

00:19:17.210 --> 00:19:18.740
that I do not understand.

00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:21.170
And you guys use them like
[SNAPS FINGERS] everybody

00:19:21.170 --> 00:19:22.190
speaks your language.

00:19:22.190 --> 00:19:24.020
And I'm like, wait, what?

00:19:24.020 --> 00:19:25.763
Therapists are no different.

00:19:25.763 --> 00:19:27.680
We all have our own set
of language and things

00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:28.170
that we use.

00:19:28.170 --> 00:19:30.462
And so if they ever don't
communicate something to you,

00:19:30.462 --> 00:19:32.732
or you're not sure,
like what is CBT?

00:19:32.732 --> 00:19:34.190
And they're like,
oh, it's actually

00:19:34.190 --> 00:19:35.778
cognitive behavioral therapy.

00:19:35.778 --> 00:19:36.570
I'm glad you asked.

00:19:36.570 --> 00:19:38.040
And they can explain it to you.

00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:39.707
So just make sure
your therapist clearly

00:19:39.707 --> 00:19:41.630
communicates what
therapy is, what they're

00:19:41.630 --> 00:19:43.760
going to do with you, so
that you feel like you're

00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:44.780
part of the process.

00:19:44.780 --> 00:19:46.780
You shouldn't feel like
you're being drug along.

00:19:48.890 --> 00:19:51.140
Now the third sign that
you're seeing a good therapist

00:19:51.140 --> 00:19:53.208
is that they challenge you.

00:19:53.208 --> 00:19:54.500
And this one's a little tricky.

00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:56.417
And it's something that
you and your therapist

00:19:56.417 --> 00:20:00.140
will get used to together,
because when I say challenge,

00:20:00.140 --> 00:20:03.330
I don't mean push you
to your breaking point,

00:20:03.330 --> 00:20:05.580
challenge you so much that
you can't even get to work.

00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:07.440
And you can't do
all you need to do.

00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:08.940
That's not what I
mean by challenge.

00:20:08.940 --> 00:20:11.300
I mean just make you a
little uncomfortable.

00:20:11.300 --> 00:20:14.870
Ask you questions that you're
like, oh, I know that answer,

00:20:14.870 --> 00:20:17.990
but they just
really got in there.

00:20:17.990 --> 00:20:19.100
You want that.

00:20:19.100 --> 00:20:21.920
That's the good challenge,
because being uncomfortable

00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:22.850
is when we change.

00:20:22.850 --> 00:20:24.230
It's when we grow.

00:20:24.230 --> 00:20:26.402
And so you want your
therapist to challenge you.

00:20:26.402 --> 00:20:27.860
Because if they're
not, then you're

00:20:27.860 --> 00:20:30.260
just hanging out with a friend
having a weird conversation.

00:20:30.260 --> 00:20:31.885
And you don't know
anything about them.

00:20:31.885 --> 00:20:33.270
Why are we paying for that?

00:20:33.270 --> 00:20:34.910
And I want to make sure you
get your time and money's worth

00:20:34.910 --> 00:20:35.868
when you're in therapy.

00:20:35.868 --> 00:20:38.965
So make sure that your
therapist is challenging you.

00:20:38.965 --> 00:20:41.090
Then the fourth sign you're
seeing a good therapist

00:20:41.090 --> 00:20:43.220
is that they help
you better express

00:20:43.220 --> 00:20:46.410
yourself and your emotions.

00:20:46.410 --> 00:20:48.290
I don't know why,
but there's something

00:20:48.290 --> 00:20:52.122
that's so good about having
a word for what's going on.

00:20:52.122 --> 00:20:54.080
I can't tell you how many
comments I get online

00:20:54.080 --> 00:21:00.163
when I'll do a video, let's
say, about ADHD or depression.

00:21:00.163 --> 00:21:02.330
And someone in the comments
will be like, oh my god.

00:21:02.330 --> 00:21:03.740
I've been struggling
with this for 10 years,

00:21:03.740 --> 00:21:04.950
and now I have a word for it.

00:21:04.950 --> 00:21:06.090
I had no idea.

00:21:06.090 --> 00:21:08.415
I didn't know that
was what it's called.

00:21:08.415 --> 00:21:10.040
And the therapist,
it's part of our job

00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:11.630
to help you give
language to that,

00:21:11.630 --> 00:21:15.540
like I've just been feeling
like I can't catch my breath.

00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:18.680
And I lay down in bed, and
my brain is just racing.

00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:20.430
And I'm just not
sure what it is.

00:21:20.430 --> 00:21:23.465
And if I said, well,
it could be anxiety.

00:21:23.465 --> 00:21:24.590
It could be a panic attack.

00:21:24.590 --> 00:21:26.500
Does it feel like
you're drowning?

00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:28.910
Do you feel like
maybe you're dying?

00:21:28.910 --> 00:21:31.790
That's what panic attacks
feel like, if you don't know.

00:21:31.790 --> 00:21:34.123
And once you have
a word for that,

00:21:34.123 --> 00:21:36.040
it can sometimes make
you feel so much better,

00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:37.910
cause you're like,
I'm not crazy.

00:21:37.910 --> 00:21:39.380
Number one, none of us are.

00:21:39.380 --> 00:21:42.290
We're all a little weird, and
that's what makes it cool.

00:21:42.290 --> 00:21:45.260
So you're not crazy, and
you're not making it up.

00:21:45.260 --> 00:21:46.760
And that's why it's
so great to have

00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:49.518
words to put to how we feel
so that it's not just like,

00:21:49.518 --> 00:21:50.060
I don't know.

00:21:50.060 --> 00:21:51.980
I just can't catch my breath.

00:21:51.980 --> 00:21:54.020
It's like, we know how
to describe our symptoms,

00:21:54.020 --> 00:21:55.190
but it's up to the
therapist to be

00:21:55.190 --> 00:21:57.830
like, oh, that sounds like it
could be this, this, or this.

00:21:57.830 --> 00:21:59.060
Let's talk about that.

00:21:59.060 --> 00:22:00.560
And that can be
really validating,

00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:02.990
and it can give you
language to explain it

00:22:02.990 --> 00:22:05.902
to friends and family as well.

00:22:05.902 --> 00:22:07.610
Then the fifth and
final sign that you're

00:22:07.610 --> 00:22:09.770
seeing a good therapist
is that they periodically

00:22:09.770 --> 00:22:12.020
talk you through all
the work you've done.

00:22:12.020 --> 00:22:13.700
And that's, like I
was already talking

00:22:13.700 --> 00:22:16.370
about with the red flag, is that
don't give you any feedback.

00:22:16.370 --> 00:22:19.220
A good therapist reminds
you of how far you've come,

00:22:19.220 --> 00:22:20.630
all the work you've done.

00:22:20.630 --> 00:22:23.300
Even if it was last week,
you got through a whole week

00:22:23.300 --> 00:22:24.320
without a panic attack.

00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:26.870
Or you made it to work on time,
and you showered three times

00:22:26.870 --> 00:22:27.370
last week.

00:22:27.370 --> 00:22:28.340
That was amazing.

00:22:28.340 --> 00:22:29.870
That's awesome.

00:22:29.870 --> 00:22:31.160
That keeps us motivated.

00:22:31.160 --> 00:22:32.505
It makes us hopeful.

00:22:32.505 --> 00:22:34.880
And that's something that I
believe every good therapist,

00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:36.380
every mental health
professional in general

00:22:36.380 --> 00:22:38.047
should be able to
give to their patients

00:22:38.047 --> 00:22:41.898
is hope, because that's
what keeps us going.

00:22:41.898 --> 00:22:43.190
That's what keeps us motivated.

00:22:43.190 --> 00:22:45.440
And so if they walk you
through all the good things

00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:48.650
you've done, then it
really helps with that.

00:22:48.650 --> 00:22:49.580
OK.

00:22:49.580 --> 00:22:54.320
So let's say we've realized that
we need some professional help.

00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:55.640
We've reached out.

00:22:55.640 --> 00:22:57.050
We found a really
good therapist.

00:22:57.050 --> 00:22:58.160
Yay!

00:22:58.160 --> 00:23:00.620
And we're working our
butt off in therapy.

00:23:00.620 --> 00:23:04.190
But now we've
found that maybe we

00:23:04.190 --> 00:23:05.663
couldn't go on that
family vacation

00:23:05.663 --> 00:23:07.580
because we know that was
going to be stressful

00:23:07.580 --> 00:23:09.260
because our mom just
pushes our buttons.

00:23:09.260 --> 00:23:10.370
And our aunt is all crazy.

00:23:10.370 --> 00:23:11.430
And then they both
start talking,

00:23:11.430 --> 00:23:12.410
and it's like too much.

00:23:12.410 --> 00:23:13.640
So I can't go.

00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:15.348
Or I have to take some
time off from work

00:23:15.348 --> 00:23:17.223
because I need some more
intensive treatment,

00:23:17.223 --> 00:23:20.000
because I just can't get a hold
of it on my own in one session

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:20.500
a week.

00:23:20.500 --> 00:23:22.020
That's just not enough.

00:23:22.020 --> 00:23:23.720
How do we talk to our
friends and family

00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:24.840
about our mental illness?

00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:26.720
And I get this question a lot.

00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:30.973
And another cool thing
that's happened online

00:23:30.973 --> 00:23:32.390
is, because I get
questions about,

00:23:32.390 --> 00:23:34.610
how do I tell my
friends and family?

00:23:34.610 --> 00:23:36.710
But by and large,
the question I get

00:23:36.710 --> 00:23:40.547
asked more is, how do I help
someone that I care about?

00:23:40.547 --> 00:23:42.380
And I really think that
that's a cool thing,

00:23:42.380 --> 00:23:43.755
because what that
really means is

00:23:43.755 --> 00:23:45.680
that for each of us
that is struggling,

00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:48.140
there's five to 10 people
who just really want

00:23:48.140 --> 00:23:49.770
to help and support.

00:23:49.770 --> 00:23:51.590
And I truly believe
in the good in people.

00:23:51.590 --> 00:23:53.120
And that just shows
me that they're there,

00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:54.412
and they're wanting to support.

00:23:54.412 --> 00:23:56.780
And so just keep that
in mind, that people do

00:23:56.780 --> 00:23:57.960
want to hear from you.

00:23:57.960 --> 00:23:59.750
They do want to
know how to help.

00:23:59.750 --> 00:24:01.890
But often, they're
just afraid to say it.

00:24:01.890 --> 00:24:03.120
They don't know how to ask.

00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:04.490
They don't know what to say.

00:24:04.490 --> 00:24:06.657
And so the things that I'm
going to walk you through

00:24:06.657 --> 00:24:08.930
will give you a format
of how you can tell them

00:24:08.930 --> 00:24:13.150
about what's going on that's
helpful for both of you.

00:24:13.150 --> 00:24:14.900
And the first tip when
it comes to talking

00:24:14.900 --> 00:24:16.820
to friends and family
is to figure out

00:24:16.820 --> 00:24:19.640
what you want to tell them.

00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:22.777
That's the first thing
because it's about you.

00:24:22.777 --> 00:24:24.110
It's OK to be selfish right now.

00:24:24.110 --> 00:24:27.690
This is about you and what
you want them to know.

00:24:27.690 --> 00:24:30.740
So is it that you don't want
to share too much about it?

00:24:30.740 --> 00:24:33.020
Maybe you're afraid of what
they're going to think.

00:24:33.020 --> 00:24:34.070
Maybe you aren't sure.

00:24:34.070 --> 00:24:35.850
You don't have the
words to put to it yet.

00:24:35.850 --> 00:24:37.580
Maybe we haven't
seen a therapist yet,

00:24:37.580 --> 00:24:40.980
but we just want to tell
them a little bit about it.

00:24:40.980 --> 00:24:42.440
So consider that.

00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:44.780
Maybe I just want them
to know that there's

00:24:44.780 --> 00:24:47.630
a reason I can't go to
that party next weekend.

00:24:47.630 --> 00:24:48.655
Maybe that's the goal.

00:24:48.655 --> 00:24:50.780
Maybe I want to tell them
that the reason that I've

00:24:50.780 --> 00:24:53.150
been kind of distant is because
I'm just having a hard time.

00:24:53.150 --> 00:24:55.108
And I don't want them to
think it's about them.

00:24:55.108 --> 00:24:57.570
I want them to know
something's going on with me.

00:24:57.570 --> 00:25:01.930
So take some time, and consider,
what do you want to tell them?

00:25:01.930 --> 00:25:04.510
And before you go
doing anything, then--

00:25:04.510 --> 00:25:06.660
and this is the most important--

00:25:06.660 --> 00:25:10.075
what do they need to know?

00:25:10.075 --> 00:25:11.450
And I say this
because we're just

00:25:11.450 --> 00:25:13.550
starting a conversation here.

00:25:13.550 --> 00:25:15.710
I am the worst.

00:25:15.710 --> 00:25:17.485
I have what you call
verbal diarrhea.

00:25:17.485 --> 00:25:19.610
When I decide I'm going to
tell somebody something,

00:25:19.610 --> 00:25:22.940
I tell them everything, like
from the beginning to the end,

00:25:22.940 --> 00:25:23.750
from soup to nuts.

00:25:23.750 --> 00:25:24.250
I share.

00:25:24.250 --> 00:25:25.790
I'm an over-sharer.

00:25:25.790 --> 00:25:29.000
And that isn't always helpful,
because when you give somebody

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:30.830
so much information,
they really can't

00:25:30.830 --> 00:25:32.480
digest it and say anything.

00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:33.580
I can't tell you how
many times I've tried

00:25:33.580 --> 00:25:34.872
to explain something to my mom.

00:25:34.872 --> 00:25:36.590
And I just do that, bleh.

00:25:36.590 --> 00:25:40.863
And then she's like, oh, OK.

00:25:40.863 --> 00:25:42.530
I'm going to have to
call you back, sis.

00:25:42.530 --> 00:25:44.353
And I'm like, perfect.

00:25:44.353 --> 00:25:46.020
I just overwhelmed
her with information,

00:25:46.020 --> 00:25:48.782
and I didn't get anything
that I needed out of it.

00:25:48.782 --> 00:25:50.240
So consider what
they need to know.

00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:53.150
It might just be, this is
the reason I can't do this,

00:25:53.150 --> 00:25:57.080
or I'm going to need you
to help me with the copay,

00:25:57.080 --> 00:25:59.300
or I'm going to need a
little more support at home,

00:25:59.300 --> 00:26:01.300
or I'm going to need
time off from work.

00:26:01.300 --> 00:26:02.675
We're going to
have to figure out

00:26:02.675 --> 00:26:05.705
what it is we need from them
and what they need to know.

00:26:05.705 --> 00:26:08.330
And then we're going to break it
down into three to five bullet

00:26:08.330 --> 00:26:08.853
points.

00:26:08.853 --> 00:26:10.770
That's for the verbal
diarrhea people like me.

00:26:10.770 --> 00:26:13.230
It keeps it short
and to the point.

00:26:13.230 --> 00:26:14.930
So let's say I was
having a really

00:26:14.930 --> 00:26:16.770
bad time with my depression.

00:26:16.770 --> 00:26:20.270
The three to five
bullet points could be I

00:26:20.270 --> 00:26:21.770
just wanted you to
know that I think

00:26:21.770 --> 00:26:23.478
I've been struggling
with some depressive

00:26:23.478 --> 00:26:25.440
symptoms, bullet
point number one.

00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:27.940
Just that's it.

00:26:27.940 --> 00:26:29.840
Bullet point number two.

00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:31.990
And that's why I haven't
really been that present.

00:26:31.990 --> 00:26:34.610
And I haven't been able
to meet up that much.

00:26:34.610 --> 00:26:36.978
And I haven't really
returned your calls or texts.

00:26:36.978 --> 00:26:38.770
So I want them to know
it's not about them.

00:26:38.770 --> 00:26:39.580
It's me.

00:26:39.580 --> 00:26:43.030
Then the third could be,
and so I just would really

00:26:43.030 --> 00:26:44.440
like you to be
understanding as I

00:26:44.440 --> 00:26:46.540
try to figure out what's best.

00:26:46.540 --> 00:26:48.870
That's it.

00:26:48.870 --> 00:26:50.320
Pretty simple.

00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:52.740
I think a lot of times even,
like I said, I overshare.

00:26:52.740 --> 00:26:54.960
So I think we
overthink it, and we

00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:57.270
feel like we have to give
them all this information.

00:26:57.270 --> 00:27:00.330
But just always remember,
this is just the beginning

00:27:00.330 --> 00:27:01.660
of a conversation.

00:27:01.660 --> 00:27:04.160
And these are conversations
that we want to keep having.

00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:06.840
These are things that we can
talk about more as we better

00:27:06.840 --> 00:27:08.940
understand ourselves
and as we get

00:27:08.940 --> 00:27:11.070
more comfortable communicating
that with others.

00:27:11.070 --> 00:27:12.790
So don't feel like you have
to have all the answers.

00:27:12.790 --> 00:27:14.415
You don't have to
know exactly what you

00:27:14.415 --> 00:27:15.900
need from them right away.

00:27:15.900 --> 00:27:17.550
But again, just
consider the fact

00:27:17.550 --> 00:27:19.990
that they're going to want
to know how they can help.

00:27:19.990 --> 00:27:22.032
So it helps if we think
about that ahead of time.

00:27:22.032 --> 00:27:24.360
If we're like, hey, I might
need them to help get me

00:27:24.360 --> 00:27:25.320
to and from this.

00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:27.840
I might need help financially.

00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:29.970
I might need them to watch
my kids while I do this.

00:27:29.970 --> 00:27:33.078
I might need them to help
me out with a project

00:27:33.078 --> 00:27:34.870
because I might have
to take some time off.

00:27:34.870 --> 00:27:37.110
It's best to have an idea
of what we need from them

00:27:37.110 --> 00:27:39.300
because they're going to ask.

00:27:39.300 --> 00:27:41.070
So at least be
prepared for that,

00:27:41.070 --> 00:27:42.390
because people want to help.

00:27:42.390 --> 00:27:44.910
Because I believe in
the good in people.

00:27:44.910 --> 00:27:47.940
And so that's really the
best way to go about it.

00:27:47.940 --> 00:27:49.600
Put that list together.

00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:52.420
And then, this is
going to sound weird,

00:27:52.420 --> 00:27:53.730
but I promise it will help.

00:27:53.730 --> 00:27:56.100
Practice saying it out loud.

00:27:56.100 --> 00:27:57.960
You can even put
your ear buds in.

00:27:57.960 --> 00:28:00.960
Nobody will even know that
you're talking to yourself.

00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:03.562
I'm sure people do
that all the time.

00:28:03.562 --> 00:28:04.770
So just put your ear buds in.

00:28:04.770 --> 00:28:05.580
You can do it on a walk.

00:28:05.580 --> 00:28:06.663
You can do it in your car.

00:28:06.663 --> 00:28:10.230
You can do it at home in front
of the mirror in the bathroom.

00:28:10.230 --> 00:28:11.580
You can do whatever, whenever.

00:28:11.580 --> 00:28:14.190
However you can create a
little safe environment

00:28:14.190 --> 00:28:15.940
where you can practice
saying it out loud,

00:28:15.940 --> 00:28:18.060
because there's this weird
thing that happens when

00:28:18.060 --> 00:28:20.137
we are nervous about something.

00:28:20.137 --> 00:28:21.970
We're nervous about the
way that we're going

00:28:21.970 --> 00:28:23.730
to communicate how we feel.

00:28:23.730 --> 00:28:25.707
The first time those
words cross our lips--

00:28:25.707 --> 00:28:26.790
let's say it's depression.

00:28:26.790 --> 00:28:29.070
We're like, I think I'm
struggling with depression.

00:28:29.070 --> 00:28:30.923
We can get totally maxed out.

00:28:30.923 --> 00:28:32.340
We forget what
we're going to say.

00:28:32.340 --> 00:28:34.335
And then I'll revert
back to verbal diarrhea.

00:28:34.335 --> 00:28:35.460
I'll be like, I don't know.

00:28:35.460 --> 00:28:36.820
So it started a few weeks ago.

00:28:36.820 --> 00:28:38.550
And then I get way off track.

00:28:38.550 --> 00:28:40.260
I forget my bullet points.

00:28:40.260 --> 00:28:42.270
I forget what I need from them.

00:28:42.270 --> 00:28:44.198
Slow it down so
they can digest it.

00:28:44.198 --> 00:28:46.740
So if you practice saying it
out loud just a couple of times,

00:28:46.740 --> 00:28:48.198
you can even role
play in your mind

00:28:48.198 --> 00:28:50.070
what you think they'd say back.

00:28:50.070 --> 00:28:54.270
It can really help us feel
[SIGH] OK when we go to do it.

00:28:54.270 --> 00:28:56.347
We can feel like we know
what we're going to say.

00:28:56.347 --> 00:28:58.680
We are pretty sure we know
how they're going to respond,

00:28:58.680 --> 00:29:00.710
and we know exactly
what we need from them.

00:29:00.710 --> 00:29:02.520
We're just going to
stick to our points.

00:29:02.520 --> 00:29:05.050
And so practicing can
really, really help.

00:29:05.050 --> 00:29:08.160
And then just set up
a time and go do it.

00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:09.630
Don't do it in a
super stressful--

00:29:09.630 --> 00:29:12.570
like at Thanksgiving dinner or
that one time when everybody's

00:29:12.570 --> 00:29:13.110
screaming.

00:29:13.110 --> 00:29:15.972
And your cousin has a dog
that's ran out of the house.

00:29:15.972 --> 00:29:18.180
And things are on the floor,
and the kids are crying.

00:29:18.180 --> 00:29:18.720
No.

00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:21.070
Try to pick a time
where it's pretty calm.

00:29:21.070 --> 00:29:22.650
You know what to expect.

00:29:22.650 --> 00:29:24.550
You can even meet up
with them on your own,

00:29:24.550 --> 00:29:27.450
or you could have them over for
lunch, or dinner, or something.

00:29:27.450 --> 00:29:30.600
Pick a nice time,
and then just say it,

00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:32.880
because friends and family
really do want to support.

00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:34.560
They really want to help.

00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:37.620
We just often-- myself
included-- give them way too

00:29:37.620 --> 00:29:40.228
much information or don't
give them enough information.

00:29:40.228 --> 00:29:41.520
So they don't know how to help.

00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:42.970
So then they keep trying to ask.

00:29:42.970 --> 00:29:44.622
And we're like, why
are you so nosy?

00:29:44.622 --> 00:29:45.580
They just want to help.

00:29:45.580 --> 00:29:46.680
They just want to support.

00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:49.740
And so if we practice,
then we can get it out

00:29:49.740 --> 00:29:52.270
in the right way.

00:29:52.270 --> 00:29:54.270
I know that was a
lot, and I don't

00:29:54.270 --> 00:29:56.020
like to talk too much
because I'm actually

00:29:56.020 --> 00:29:58.490
more interested in questions.

00:29:58.490 --> 00:30:01.900
So if you just woke up
from a nap, totally fine.

00:30:01.900 --> 00:30:02.400
I get it.

00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:03.810
You guys work long hours.

00:30:03.810 --> 00:30:06.690
But the key takeaways are
how to know if you need help

00:30:06.690 --> 00:30:09.240
is if you aren't able to get
what you need to get done

00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:10.170
each and every day.

00:30:10.170 --> 00:30:11.490
If it's just like a struggle.

00:30:11.490 --> 00:30:12.990
You're just white knuckling it.

00:30:12.990 --> 00:30:15.533
You don't feel like you're
functioning in your life.

00:30:15.533 --> 00:30:16.950
It's time to reach
out to someone.

00:30:16.950 --> 00:30:18.630
But also remember,
we can all benefit

00:30:18.630 --> 00:30:19.920
from seeing a therapist.

00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:22.742
There's no bar to entry.

00:30:22.742 --> 00:30:24.450
Then the second key
takeaway is that when

00:30:24.450 --> 00:30:26.160
picking a mental
health professional,

00:30:26.160 --> 00:30:28.368
the most important thing is
that you feel comfortable

00:30:28.368 --> 00:30:31.505
and understood by them.

00:30:31.505 --> 00:30:32.880
And then the third
takeaway, make

00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:35.100
sure your therapist
validates you,

00:30:35.100 --> 00:30:37.200
has you working
towards goals, and you

00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:40.050
feel like they're on your
side rooting for you.

00:30:40.050 --> 00:30:41.820
And then the final
is when it comes

00:30:41.820 --> 00:30:45.150
to telling friends and family,
keep it short and to the point.

00:30:45.150 --> 00:30:48.480
And tell them how
they can help you.

00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:49.690
I hope that was helpful.

00:30:49.690 --> 00:30:52.170
Thank you so much for having
me at this Google Talk.

00:30:52.170 --> 00:30:54.008
And now we'll take
some questions.

00:30:54.008 --> 00:30:57.354
[APPLAUSE]

00:31:00.702 --> 00:31:02.410
AUDIENCE: We have a
question in the Dory.

00:31:02.410 --> 00:31:04.810
It reads, in your
experience or opinion,

00:31:04.810 --> 00:31:06.430
does depression cause ADD?

00:31:06.430 --> 00:31:10.060
Or can ADD and its associated
impact cause depression?

00:31:10.060 --> 00:31:12.220
For someone experiencing
both, which would

00:31:12.220 --> 00:31:15.080
you recommend treating
more directly?

00:31:15.080 --> 00:31:16.660
KATI MORTON: I think,
I mean, there's

00:31:16.660 --> 00:31:18.520
a lot of questions about
which came first, the chicken

00:31:18.520 --> 00:31:19.510
or the egg kind of thing?

00:31:19.510 --> 00:31:20.427
Was it the depression?

00:31:20.427 --> 00:31:23.140
Was it the ADD?

00:31:23.140 --> 00:31:24.680
It can go both ways.

00:31:24.680 --> 00:31:27.580
I've had a lot of patients
that once we get one diagnosis,

00:31:27.580 --> 00:31:29.830
depression can come along
so easily with things

00:31:29.830 --> 00:31:31.412
because it can
take away our hope.

00:31:31.412 --> 00:31:33.370
We can think like, oh,
well now I'm just weird.

00:31:33.370 --> 00:31:35.287
And my brain works in a
totally different way.

00:31:35.287 --> 00:31:39.060
And that's why I'm just
struggling at work or school.

00:31:39.060 --> 00:31:41.710
And so it really would
depend on their own situation

00:31:41.710 --> 00:31:43.352
which came first.

00:31:43.352 --> 00:31:45.310
I would have them track
back to when they first

00:31:45.310 --> 00:31:46.780
started experiencing
the symptoms,

00:31:46.780 --> 00:31:49.120
and what were those symptoms?

00:31:49.120 --> 00:31:52.920
But I know that ADHD is often
misdiagnosed as other things.

00:31:52.920 --> 00:31:56.800
So my guess would be
that, but I don't know.

00:31:56.800 --> 00:32:00.460
And then I think as far
as treatment, whatever

00:32:00.460 --> 00:32:01.780
is the most debilitating.

00:32:01.780 --> 00:32:06.070
What symptoms are bothering
them day in and day out?

00:32:06.070 --> 00:32:09.700
Because they both
warrant treatment,

00:32:09.700 --> 00:32:12.520
and you'd be able to find
someone that can treat both.

00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:14.980
But definitely
consider which symptoms

00:32:14.980 --> 00:32:17.890
are the strongest and making
their days the most difficult.

00:32:17.890 --> 00:32:19.000
I know that's not like--

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:21.542
I don't give straight answers,
because everybody's different.

00:32:21.542 --> 00:32:23.131
So I'm sorry.

00:32:23.131 --> 00:32:25.330
AUDIENCE: What if the
therapist's only solution

00:32:25.330 --> 00:32:29.020
is medication and reassurance
but no real long term solution?

00:32:29.020 --> 00:32:31.092
KATI MORTON: Find another one.

00:32:31.092 --> 00:32:32.800
I mean, I know that
sounds kind of harsh,

00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:34.970
but there's so many
therapeutic techniques

00:32:34.970 --> 00:32:36.722
that can help people.

00:32:36.722 --> 00:32:38.680
For instance, I don't
see this patient anymore,

00:32:38.680 --> 00:32:40.130
but I used to have a
patient with schizophrenia.

00:32:40.130 --> 00:32:42.100
Which a lot of people would
say, oh, it's just medication.

00:32:42.100 --> 00:32:43.642
That's all that's
going to help them.

00:32:43.642 --> 00:32:45.550
But no, he also had
depression as a result

00:32:45.550 --> 00:32:46.425
of the schizophrenia.

00:32:46.425 --> 00:32:48.320
And the diagnosis was
really hard for him.

00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:49.600
And then it was
also relationships,

00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:50.860
because he had a
hard time relating

00:32:50.860 --> 00:32:52.027
with the people in his life.

00:32:52.027 --> 00:32:53.540
And then he felt
very disconnected.

00:32:53.540 --> 00:32:55.700
And so there are always tools.

00:32:55.700 --> 00:32:57.910
I would assume
either the therapist

00:32:57.910 --> 00:32:59.890
is, lazy because we're people.

00:32:59.890 --> 00:33:01.390
We're good and bad
at our jobs, too.

00:33:01.390 --> 00:33:02.170
Don't forget that.

00:33:02.170 --> 00:33:04.253
You can see someone that
cuts your hair perfectly,

00:33:04.253 --> 00:33:05.860
and the other person
just butchers it.

00:33:05.860 --> 00:33:08.657
And so therapists, they can
be bad at their jobs, too.

00:33:08.657 --> 00:33:11.240
Don't think that we have all the
answers, and we're all great.

00:33:11.240 --> 00:33:13.000
It's important for
you to feel it out.

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:15.710
And a therapist should never
tell you, it's only medication.

00:33:15.710 --> 00:33:19.150
They should understand
your mental illness,

00:33:19.150 --> 00:33:22.030
and have tools, and help you
work through it, even just

00:33:22.030 --> 00:33:22.857
behaviorally.

00:33:22.857 --> 00:33:25.190
Even if it's like, I want you
to get more sleep at night

00:33:25.190 --> 00:33:26.648
and try to shower
a few more times,

00:33:26.648 --> 00:33:28.120
those are all really
helpful tools.

00:33:28.120 --> 00:33:31.420
So don't think that medication
is your only option.

00:33:31.420 --> 00:33:32.595
That's a bad therapist.

00:33:32.595 --> 00:33:35.200
AUDIENCE: So you talked
about how you could

00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:36.610
share that you need support.

00:33:36.610 --> 00:33:38.170
Can you talk more
about if you notice

00:33:38.170 --> 00:33:41.500
that someone is struggling,
and they haven't opened up,

00:33:41.500 --> 00:33:42.910
should we not say anything?

00:33:42.910 --> 00:33:44.387
Should we ask if they're OK?

00:33:44.387 --> 00:33:45.470
What are your suggestions?

00:33:45.470 --> 00:33:47.262
KATI MORTON: Yeah,
that's a great question.

00:33:47.262 --> 00:33:50.050
And I think that depends on
how close you are to someone.

00:33:50.050 --> 00:33:54.100
I think by and large, it helps
to just check in with people.

00:33:54.100 --> 00:33:56.923
The one thing that I've heard
from a lot of my viewers

00:33:56.923 --> 00:33:58.840
is that they just want
someone just to come by

00:33:58.840 --> 00:34:00.340
and be like, hey,
how are you doing?

00:34:00.340 --> 00:34:02.753
Or I've noticed you haven't
really been yourself,

00:34:02.753 --> 00:34:04.420
or you haven't been
at work or whatever.

00:34:04.420 --> 00:34:05.960
You can approach someone
and just say, hey,

00:34:05.960 --> 00:34:07.002
I'm just thinking of you.

00:34:07.002 --> 00:34:08.780
And I'm here if you need.

00:34:08.780 --> 00:34:09.790
We don't have to pry.

00:34:09.790 --> 00:34:11.123
There shouldn't be any judgment.

00:34:14.409 --> 00:34:16.900
Help can look like judgment
when it comes in the form

00:34:16.900 --> 00:34:19.438
of, well, maybe
you should just--

00:34:19.438 --> 00:34:21.230
insert thing that they
think you should do.

00:34:21.230 --> 00:34:23.440
Maybe you should
just see a therapist,

00:34:23.440 --> 00:34:25.358
exercise, sleep
well, smile more.

00:34:25.358 --> 00:34:25.900
I don't know.

00:34:25.900 --> 00:34:27.400
People say all sorts
of crazy things

00:34:27.400 --> 00:34:28.710
when it comes to mental health.

00:34:28.710 --> 00:34:31.510
They're like, you just need
a smile more, like shower.

00:34:31.510 --> 00:34:34.550
I don't know, whatever they say,
that we don't want to do that.

00:34:34.550 --> 00:34:35.600
We just want to check in.

00:34:35.600 --> 00:34:38.020
We want to let them
know that we're there.

00:34:38.020 --> 00:34:39.545
And sometimes it's
just being there.

00:34:39.545 --> 00:34:41.920
If you know a close friend of
yours is really struggling,

00:34:41.920 --> 00:34:42.870
be like, I'm going
to bring pizza,

00:34:42.870 --> 00:34:44.739
and I'm just going to
watch Netflix with you.

00:34:44.739 --> 00:34:45.281
Is that cool?

00:34:45.281 --> 00:34:46.270
I'll be over.

00:34:46.270 --> 00:34:49.070
Sometimes that's all people
want is just someone there.

00:34:49.070 --> 00:34:51.320
We don't even necessarily
have to have a conversation.

00:34:51.320 --> 00:34:54.100
But just holding
off on the judgment.

00:34:54.100 --> 00:34:56.350
Offering to support
them, like, hey,

00:34:56.350 --> 00:34:58.270
if you ever need me
to take you anywhere,

00:34:58.270 --> 00:35:00.518
or you need help getting
help, if you want.

00:35:00.518 --> 00:35:02.560
If you want to see a
therapist, I'm totally down.

00:35:02.560 --> 00:35:03.700
I'm around.

00:35:03.700 --> 00:35:06.190
But just know that I care.

00:35:06.190 --> 00:35:07.150
And I know it can suck.

00:35:07.150 --> 00:35:09.430
A lot of people feel really
hopeless and helpless,

00:35:09.430 --> 00:35:12.040
like I don't know
what to do for them.

00:35:12.040 --> 00:35:15.370
But just remember that we
can't work harder than them.

00:35:15.370 --> 00:35:18.440
We all have to do it ourselves.

00:35:18.440 --> 00:35:19.610
We can't fix someone else.

00:35:19.610 --> 00:35:21.670
We can't make someone
else feel better,

00:35:21.670 --> 00:35:24.670
but we can support, let
them know that we love them,

00:35:24.670 --> 00:35:26.170
we care about them.

00:35:26.170 --> 00:35:30.832
And that's really where
we should try to support.

00:35:30.832 --> 00:35:31.332
Hi!

00:35:31.332 --> 00:35:32.290
AUDIENCE: Hi, Kati!

00:35:32.290 --> 00:35:33.040
It's so good to see you.

00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:34.170
KATI MORTON: So good to see you.

00:35:34.170 --> 00:35:34.890
AUDIENCE: Thanks for being here.

00:35:34.890 --> 00:35:36.098
KATI MORTON: Yeah, of course.

00:35:36.098 --> 00:35:38.880
AUDIENCE: So my question is
around the method of therapy.

00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:41.100
There are so many options
now, like Talkspace

00:35:41.100 --> 00:35:43.448
with text, video
call, in person.

00:35:43.448 --> 00:35:45.490
Is there any difference
between the effectiveness

00:35:45.490 --> 00:35:46.510
of any of these methods?

00:35:46.510 --> 00:35:47.750
KATI MORTON: I
haven't looked at--

00:35:47.750 --> 00:35:49.745
I don't know if there's
any post hoc analysis.

00:35:49.745 --> 00:35:50.620
Do you know, Jessica?

00:35:50.620 --> 00:35:52.900
I mean, personally for me,
I'll give you my opinion.

00:35:52.900 --> 00:35:55.690
But I haven't read
research on this.

00:35:55.690 --> 00:35:59.725
In person is best because
there's so much that-- we all

00:35:59.725 --> 00:36:00.600
know, we can fake it.

00:36:00.600 --> 00:36:01.100
Trust me.

00:36:01.100 --> 00:36:04.010
I film videos on YouTube,
and 99.9% of the time,

00:36:04.010 --> 00:36:06.210
I'm wearing pajama pants.

00:36:06.210 --> 00:36:07.170
You have no idea.

00:36:07.170 --> 00:36:09.600
You only see me from here up.

00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:11.880
So I think of that in
relation to therapy,

00:36:11.880 --> 00:36:15.750
where I'm going to notice
if a patient is fidgeting

00:36:15.750 --> 00:36:18.050
a lot because I have
patients who sit

00:36:18.050 --> 00:36:19.300
on the very edge of the couch.

00:36:19.300 --> 00:36:21.300
And I'm like, relax.

00:36:21.300 --> 00:36:26.070
But those things will be lost
over Skype, let's say, or text,

00:36:26.070 --> 00:36:27.600
or email.

00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:29.110
I think it's better
than nothing.

00:36:29.110 --> 00:36:31.320
If people are in rural
parts of the country,

00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:33.330
or your work
schedule's so chaotic

00:36:33.330 --> 00:36:36.110
that you just don't have time, I
think it's better than nothing.

00:36:36.110 --> 00:36:40.740
And I do appreciate the
Talkspace and the BetterHelps

00:36:40.740 --> 00:36:41.980
and stuff in the world.

00:36:41.980 --> 00:36:44.220
But I think that
in-person is best,

00:36:44.220 --> 00:36:45.996
if you can make that happen.

00:36:45.996 --> 00:36:48.750
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:36:48.750 --> 00:36:49.440
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:50.107
KATI MORTON: Hi.

00:36:50.107 --> 00:36:52.110
AUDIENCE: So I have
some friends that

00:36:52.110 --> 00:36:54.480
really don't feel as if therapy
would be helpful to them

00:36:54.480 --> 00:36:54.810
at all.

00:36:54.810 --> 00:36:57.227
And they just feel like they
would have a really hard time

00:36:57.227 --> 00:36:59.040
opening up to someone else.

00:36:59.040 --> 00:37:01.230
What are your thoughts
on if there are actually

00:37:01.230 --> 00:37:04.320
people who wouldn't benefit
from therapy, just truly

00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:06.570
because they
couldn't communicate

00:37:06.570 --> 00:37:08.115
with a stranger
about their problems?

00:37:08.115 --> 00:37:09.990
Do you think there are
any other methods that

00:37:09.990 --> 00:37:12.624
could be effective?

00:37:12.624 --> 00:37:14.970
KATI MORTON: I mean, I
think it can help everybody.

00:37:14.970 --> 00:37:16.470
And I think people
will be surprised

00:37:16.470 --> 00:37:17.722
when you find the right fit.

00:37:17.722 --> 00:37:19.680
I talked about what to
look for in a therapist.

00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:22.230
If you take the time to find
someone you connect with,

00:37:22.230 --> 00:37:24.270
you'd be surprised
what you'll share

00:37:24.270 --> 00:37:25.612
and how quickly you can open up.

00:37:25.612 --> 00:37:27.570
And it's normal to feel
really nervous at first

00:37:27.570 --> 00:37:28.350
and be like, I don't want to--

00:37:28.350 --> 00:37:29.892
I remember even my
dad would be like,

00:37:29.892 --> 00:37:32.570
I don't need to cry to a
stranger and pay them money.

00:37:32.570 --> 00:37:33.760
And I get that.

00:37:33.760 --> 00:37:37.030
But if you find the right
person, you can feel connected.

00:37:37.030 --> 00:37:39.630
But if someone is really
adverse to therapy in general,

00:37:39.630 --> 00:37:43.470
I do think there's a lot
of benefit in shared group

00:37:43.470 --> 00:37:45.330
activity with
other people, where

00:37:45.330 --> 00:37:46.860
you have group camaraderie.

00:37:46.860 --> 00:37:50.040
And you can communicate
with other people.

00:37:50.040 --> 00:37:53.040
One of the saving graces for
one of my viewers was to join--

00:37:53.040 --> 00:37:55.500
it was a dog hiking club,
because she had a dog.

00:37:55.500 --> 00:37:58.000
And that was her pride and joy.

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:00.780
And so she found a lot of help
and support from those people

00:38:00.780 --> 00:38:03.030
because then she had a group
of people where she could

00:38:03.030 --> 00:38:04.650
talk about what was going on.

00:38:04.650 --> 00:38:08.860
Because I think friends and
family are a great support,

00:38:08.860 --> 00:38:11.040
but if you don't
find yourself feeling

00:38:11.040 --> 00:38:13.590
like the weight that you're
carrying is lessened by that,

00:38:13.590 --> 00:38:15.240
then, I mean,
therapy is the best,

00:38:15.240 --> 00:38:17.250
but group activities
can be helpful, too.

00:38:17.250 --> 00:38:19.590
And you can do workbooks
on your own, too.

00:38:19.590 --> 00:38:21.040
I think those are
really helpful.

00:38:21.040 --> 00:38:23.460
There's a ton of great
workbooks out there.

00:38:23.460 --> 00:38:25.290
I even have them
if you just wanted

00:38:25.290 --> 00:38:27.750
to peruse through my
website, KatiMorton.com.

00:38:27.750 --> 00:38:31.290
I have an Amazon book
list that I keep of books

00:38:31.290 --> 00:38:34.500
that I use with my patients
for different issues, workbooks

00:38:34.500 --> 00:38:36.333
that I've even created
myself that are free.

00:38:36.333 --> 00:38:38.125
Or you can download
them in the iBookstore,

00:38:38.125 --> 00:38:40.540
if you want to pay for it just
to have it in that format.

00:38:40.540 --> 00:38:42.070
I think it's like $1.

00:38:42.070 --> 00:38:43.560
So workbooks can
be helpful, too.

00:38:43.560 --> 00:38:45.518
And that's a way you can
work on it on your own

00:38:45.518 --> 00:38:48.040
until maybe you're
ready to go to therapy.

00:38:48.040 --> 00:38:51.000
AUDIENCE: So I started going
to therapy for the first time

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:51.630
recently.

00:38:51.630 --> 00:38:53.398
KATI MORTON: Yay!

00:38:53.398 --> 00:38:56.370
AUDIENCE: And when I started
telling friends, or co-workers,

00:38:56.370 --> 00:38:58.720
people in my life that
I was going to therapy.

00:38:58.720 --> 00:39:00.540
I was surprised
that a lot of them

00:39:00.540 --> 00:39:03.792
told me that they were
already seeing a therapist.

00:39:03.792 --> 00:39:05.750
KATI MORTON: People don't
always talk about it.

00:39:05.750 --> 00:39:06.375
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:39:06.375 --> 00:39:09.600
And I was surprised that I knew
so many people that had already

00:39:09.600 --> 00:39:12.127
been seeing a therapist.

00:39:12.127 --> 00:39:14.210
And I was surprised that
I didn't know about that.

00:39:14.210 --> 00:39:15.870
And I was also
like, oh, if I had

00:39:15.870 --> 00:39:17.910
known that, that probably
would've been helpful

00:39:17.910 --> 00:39:20.670
in maybe me going to
see a therapist sooner,

00:39:20.670 --> 00:39:24.240
or just the advice you had
about how to pick a therapist.

00:39:24.240 --> 00:39:26.730
So it led me to think more
about personally how I

00:39:26.730 --> 00:39:30.420
can help to normalize therapy.

00:39:30.420 --> 00:39:34.470
So I was curious if you have
techniques or things that you

00:39:34.470 --> 00:39:39.430
do to normalize it amongst
people you know or the world,

00:39:39.430 --> 00:39:39.930
I guess.

00:39:39.930 --> 00:39:40.200
KATI MORTON: Yeah.

00:39:40.200 --> 00:39:41.367
No, that's a great question.

00:39:41.367 --> 00:39:43.140
And I think that is
the unfortunate thing,

00:39:43.140 --> 00:39:45.540
is that people don't talk
about it, because the real best

00:39:45.540 --> 00:39:48.180
way to find a good
therapist is word of mouth

00:39:48.180 --> 00:39:51.460
because people tend to
think like you and know you.

00:39:51.460 --> 00:39:55.590
And if they really like theirs,
chances are you might, too.

00:39:55.590 --> 00:39:57.192
Let's say you see
a therapist, too--

00:39:57.192 --> 00:39:58.650
just want to throw
this out there--

00:39:58.650 --> 00:40:00.010
and you end up not liking them.

00:40:00.010 --> 00:40:00.900
You just don't click.

00:40:00.900 --> 00:40:03.442
You can tell them like, hey, do
you have any other referrals?

00:40:03.442 --> 00:40:05.670
Because I'm looking for
someone who's maybe softer,

00:40:05.670 --> 00:40:08.040
warmer, harder, more tough love.

00:40:08.040 --> 00:40:09.707
And we have tons of
referrals and people

00:40:09.707 --> 00:40:11.082
we've worked with
over the years.

00:40:11.082 --> 00:40:12.390
So it's OK to ask that, too.

00:40:12.390 --> 00:40:13.973
But to answer your
question, when

00:40:13.973 --> 00:40:15.640
we're in conversation
with other people,

00:40:15.640 --> 00:40:19.080
I think it's really important
that we just bring it up

00:40:19.080 --> 00:40:22.300
in casual conversation.

00:40:22.300 --> 00:40:24.800
Even Laura and I were talking
earlier, and I was like, yeah,

00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:26.842
something I'm working on
in therapy is just hard.

00:40:26.842 --> 00:40:29.630
Because I didn't realize that
I don't know how to express

00:40:29.630 --> 00:40:32.130
angular healthfully, because
it feels really out of control.

00:40:32.130 --> 00:40:32.963
And I don't like it.

00:40:32.963 --> 00:40:34.572
And I'm like, ugh.

00:40:34.572 --> 00:40:36.030
And I think those
are conversations

00:40:36.030 --> 00:40:39.180
that we could have without
leading with, in therapy I'm

00:40:39.180 --> 00:40:40.950
doing, or whatever.

00:40:40.950 --> 00:40:43.305
Or if somebody's
noticing change in you,

00:40:43.305 --> 00:40:45.180
that's a great time to
be like, yeah, thanks.

00:40:45.180 --> 00:40:46.055
I've been in therapy.

00:40:46.055 --> 00:40:47.200
It's been really helpful.

00:40:47.200 --> 00:40:48.240
Cool.

00:40:48.240 --> 00:40:51.460
I think that's a
casual thing as well.

00:40:51.460 --> 00:40:54.210
I think just the more we can
all talk about how we feel,

00:40:54.210 --> 00:40:57.310
how seeing someone can
help us feel better,

00:40:57.310 --> 00:40:59.850
people will be less-- we won't
be as scared-- bless you--

00:40:59.850 --> 00:41:01.920
we won't be as scared to
reach out on get help.

00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:04.500
But I just think in casual
conversation, as it applies.

00:41:04.500 --> 00:41:08.067
I wouldn't go out of our
way to share about it.

00:41:08.067 --> 00:41:10.650
But if someone in your life is
hurting, you could come to them

00:41:10.650 --> 00:41:12.150
and say like, hey,
I've just noticed

00:41:12.150 --> 00:41:13.275
you're having a tough time.

00:41:13.275 --> 00:41:15.180
Be like, therapy's really
been helpful to me,

00:41:15.180 --> 00:41:17.400
if you ever need any referrals.

00:41:17.400 --> 00:41:20.175
Or I could tell you who
I'm seeing if that helps.

00:41:20.175 --> 00:41:21.700
And put it out there that way.

00:41:21.700 --> 00:41:24.522
I think there's just some
nice ways to plant seeds.

00:41:24.522 --> 00:41:26.730
But just know that we can't
make it grow into a tree.

00:41:26.730 --> 00:41:27.965
We can just plant the seeds.

00:41:27.965 --> 00:41:28.840
You know what I mean?

00:41:28.840 --> 00:41:29.800
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:41:29.800 --> 00:41:30.300
awesome.

00:41:30.300 --> 00:41:32.468
Thank you.

00:41:32.468 --> 00:41:33.760
KATI MORTON: It's awfully tall.

00:41:33.760 --> 00:41:35.850
AUDIENCE: Other
than word of mouth,

00:41:35.850 --> 00:41:38.550
are there any good resources
that you would recommend

00:41:38.550 --> 00:41:42.400
to find a therapist
or, more importantly,

00:41:42.400 --> 00:41:47.340
find a therapist that you
think is best for you?

00:41:47.340 --> 00:41:48.090
KATI MORTON: Yeah.

00:41:48.090 --> 00:41:49.548
I mean, there's a
couple of things,

00:41:49.548 --> 00:41:51.653
like it's OK when you call.

00:41:51.653 --> 00:41:53.070
Here, I'll start
at the beginning.

00:41:53.070 --> 00:41:53.570
Sorry.

00:41:53.570 --> 00:41:55.060
I'm like, that's too far ahead.

00:41:55.060 --> 00:41:57.600
So the best way
is word of mouth,

00:41:57.600 --> 00:41:59.370
but also just going
through your insurance

00:41:59.370 --> 00:42:01.140
and getting a list of providers.

00:42:01.140 --> 00:42:02.970
And then we take
to the internet,

00:42:02.970 --> 00:42:05.070
because almost any therapist
these days would have

00:42:05.070 --> 00:42:07.830
at least a website, at least.

00:42:07.830 --> 00:42:08.760
Not all of them do.

00:42:08.760 --> 00:42:10.920
Like maybe the old
fuddy-duddies don't.

00:42:10.920 --> 00:42:13.780
But most people have at
least a website with a photo.

00:42:13.780 --> 00:42:15.660
And through how they
write their bio out,

00:42:15.660 --> 00:42:18.270
because everybody
writes their own bios,

00:42:18.270 --> 00:42:20.460
and they have a photo, you
can get a feel for them.

00:42:20.460 --> 00:42:21.960
And so I would
encourage you to pick

00:42:21.960 --> 00:42:24.660
three that seem kind of nice.

00:42:24.660 --> 00:42:26.250
I picked my therapist.

00:42:26.250 --> 00:42:27.815
I got a couple names.

00:42:27.815 --> 00:42:29.190
I think I had
three or four names

00:42:29.190 --> 00:42:31.200
from my previous therapist
who was retiring.

00:42:31.200 --> 00:42:32.890
And my therapist had a--

00:42:32.890 --> 00:42:35.322
I don't know-- kind of a
hippy dippy looking website.

00:42:35.322 --> 00:42:37.030
And I was like, ooh,
I already like this.

00:42:37.030 --> 00:42:37.883
But that's just me.

00:42:37.883 --> 00:42:39.300
And so get a feel
for it that way.

00:42:39.300 --> 00:42:40.680
And then make a few calls.

00:42:40.680 --> 00:42:42.900
And based on when they
call you and the message

00:42:42.900 --> 00:42:45.540
they leave, just trust your gut
when it comes to that stuff.

00:42:45.540 --> 00:42:47.790
But I always say insurance
lists are best because they

00:42:47.790 --> 00:42:49.950
give you so many in your area.

00:42:49.950 --> 00:42:52.230
And also know, then the thing
I was going to say also,

00:42:52.230 --> 00:42:54.580
is if you kind of have an
idea of what it is, like,

00:42:54.580 --> 00:42:55.080
oh I feel--

00:42:55.080 --> 00:42:58.302
I think it might be anxiety, or
I think it might be depression,

00:42:58.302 --> 00:43:00.010
or I think it might
be an eating disorder

00:43:00.010 --> 00:43:02.390
or whatever you think it
might be, ask them straight up

00:43:02.390 --> 00:43:04.140
like, have you ever
treated someone with--

00:43:04.140 --> 00:43:06.210
insert thing.

00:43:06.210 --> 00:43:09.150
And gauge how well
you like their answer.

00:43:09.150 --> 00:43:12.190
I know it sounds bad, but
you can be judgmental.

00:43:12.190 --> 00:43:13.050
It's your treatment.

00:43:13.050 --> 00:43:15.550
Find somebody that's
a good fit for you.

00:43:15.550 --> 00:43:16.964
And then there's also--

00:43:16.964 --> 00:43:19.200
Vitals is a website
where people leave

00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:22.440
reviews for medical
professionals as a whole.

00:43:22.440 --> 00:43:23.940
There's some
therapists on there.

00:43:23.940 --> 00:43:26.340
Also, even Yelp
has some reviews.

00:43:26.340 --> 00:43:27.300
But google them.

00:43:27.300 --> 00:43:29.510
Do your sleuthing.

00:43:29.510 --> 00:43:32.010
And also know that people are
more apt to leave a bad review

00:43:32.010 --> 00:43:32.802
than a good review.

00:43:32.802 --> 00:43:36.320
But it at least gives you an
idea of what the problem was.

00:43:36.320 --> 00:43:38.790
And I wish-- someone
needs to create a review

00:43:38.790 --> 00:43:41.490
site for therapy because
there just isn't one.

00:43:41.490 --> 00:43:43.450
But those are the
ones that I know of.

00:43:43.450 --> 00:43:44.945
In "Psychology
Today," also there's

00:43:44.945 --> 00:43:46.320
a lot of therapists
in that, too.

00:43:46.320 --> 00:43:48.831
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:43:48.831 --> 00:43:51.810
AUDIENCE: I always feel myself
trapped and upset feeling.

00:43:51.810 --> 00:43:53.370
And it is so hard
for me to get out

00:43:53.370 --> 00:43:56.580
of it even if I understand
fully that the situation is not

00:43:56.580 --> 00:43:57.662
very bad.

00:43:57.662 --> 00:43:59.370
I always need my
friends, family, partner

00:43:59.370 --> 00:44:01.162
to console me and pull me out.

00:44:01.162 --> 00:44:03.120
I don't want to depend
so much on other people.

00:44:03.120 --> 00:44:05.850
How can I help myself?

00:44:05.850 --> 00:44:07.965
KATI MORTON: There's a
lot of things you can do.

00:44:07.965 --> 00:44:09.340
And this is going
to sound weird,

00:44:09.340 --> 00:44:10.680
but whenever we
feel hopeless, or we

00:44:10.680 --> 00:44:12.597
feel like we're getting
sucked into something,

00:44:12.597 --> 00:44:16.202
and we feel trapped, we have
to work on our confidence.

00:44:16.202 --> 00:44:17.910
I know that sounds
really weird, but it's

00:44:17.910 --> 00:44:20.340
like the "I believe
I can" feeling,

00:44:20.340 --> 00:44:21.960
that when we feel
like total garbage,

00:44:21.960 --> 00:44:23.880
we don't have that "I
believe I can feeling."

00:44:23.880 --> 00:44:24.720
We're like, I can't.

00:44:24.720 --> 00:44:25.200
I can't.

00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:25.680
I can't.

00:44:25.680 --> 00:44:26.180
I can't.

00:44:26.180 --> 00:44:27.510
That's all we hear.

00:44:27.510 --> 00:44:31.140
And so if you can start
your day off with one thing

00:44:31.140 --> 00:44:33.000
that you like about
yourself or one thing

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:35.250
you're grateful for
in your situation,

00:44:35.250 --> 00:44:38.190
and if one is really
easy, let's try for three.

00:44:38.190 --> 00:44:40.230
And so building that
up will really help us

00:44:40.230 --> 00:44:43.330
feel more able to
do it ourselves.

00:44:43.330 --> 00:44:47.430
And then, when it comes to
what's helped you in the past--

00:44:47.430 --> 00:44:48.880
because you can be a detective.

00:44:48.880 --> 00:44:51.422
So if something is helping, if
friends and family are helping

00:44:51.422 --> 00:44:54.380
and their support helps pull you
out, what it is that they do?

00:44:54.380 --> 00:44:56.400
Be a total sleuth on this.

00:44:56.400 --> 00:44:58.650
What is it that they say,
or what is it they do?

00:44:58.650 --> 00:45:01.320
How do I feel that helps
me get out of that?

00:45:01.320 --> 00:45:02.680
What is it?

00:45:02.680 --> 00:45:05.547
And then see if you can do it
for yourself, because there's

00:45:05.547 --> 00:45:08.130
a lot of things that we can do
ourselves that we honestly just

00:45:08.130 --> 00:45:11.030
don't even know that
that's what it is.

00:45:11.030 --> 00:45:12.030
Do you know what I mean?

00:45:12.030 --> 00:45:14.880
It's like, for
instance, my mom, she'll

00:45:14.880 --> 00:45:16.900
say like, yeah, I hear you.

00:45:16.900 --> 00:45:17.400
I hear you.

00:45:17.400 --> 00:45:18.233
She says that a lot.

00:45:18.233 --> 00:45:20.130
And that makes me
feel validated.

00:45:20.130 --> 00:45:23.380
And then I'm like, [SIGH]
I wasn't being crazy,

00:45:23.380 --> 00:45:24.360
even if I was.

00:45:24.360 --> 00:45:25.647
But it just feels good.

00:45:25.647 --> 00:45:27.480
And so if that's what
it is, then maybe it's

00:45:27.480 --> 00:45:31.170
a mantra you say to yourself,
like yeah, that how you feel

00:45:31.170 --> 00:45:32.040
is real.

00:45:32.040 --> 00:45:33.330
How you feel is warranted.

00:45:33.330 --> 00:45:34.922
That was a bad situation.

00:45:34.922 --> 00:45:36.630
Trying to validate
yourself can sometimes

00:45:36.630 --> 00:45:38.640
give you that power
that maybe you're

00:45:38.640 --> 00:45:42.060
getting from your supports
that helps lift you out.

00:45:42.060 --> 00:45:43.710
So be a detective
to figure out what

00:45:43.710 --> 00:45:45.835
it is that's helping you
pull yourself out, and see

00:45:45.835 --> 00:45:47.232
if you can do it for yourself.

00:45:47.232 --> 00:45:48.940
AUDIENCE: If you could
think of one thing

00:45:48.940 --> 00:45:51.670
that Google could do to help
people with mental illness,

00:45:51.670 --> 00:45:53.700
what would it be?

00:45:53.700 --> 00:45:56.700
KATI MORTON: Do they
have therapists on site?

00:45:56.700 --> 00:45:59.290
That would be my number
one recommendation

00:45:59.290 --> 00:46:02.230
because you guys work
a lot of hours, I know.

00:46:02.230 --> 00:46:04.510
And there's a lot
that's asked of you.

00:46:04.510 --> 00:46:07.450
And so I think that being
something you can easily

00:46:07.450 --> 00:46:10.990
weave into your weeks
without any issue

00:46:10.990 --> 00:46:13.985
would be really nice, making
a point of seeing a therapist.

00:46:13.985 --> 00:46:16.110
Do you have multiple
therapists or just one or two?

00:46:16.110 --> 00:46:16.480
OK, cool.

00:46:16.480 --> 00:46:17.560
AUDIENCE: We have a
couple of therapists

00:46:17.560 --> 00:46:19.018
here a couple days
during the week.

00:46:19.018 --> 00:46:19.973
KATI MORTON: OK.

00:46:19.973 --> 00:46:22.390
So maybe just increasing their
hours, because a lot of you

00:46:22.390 --> 00:46:23.140
are going to ask.

00:46:23.140 --> 00:46:26.260
We're going to talk to somebody,
and then we'll need them more.

00:46:26.260 --> 00:46:28.510
But yeah, I think that that's
a really great resource.

00:46:28.510 --> 00:46:29.658
Also, having EAPs.

00:46:29.658 --> 00:46:31.450
I don't know, because
I don't all of your--

00:46:31.450 --> 00:46:33.033
I'm sure you guys
have all that stuff.

00:46:33.033 --> 00:46:36.130
But EAPs stand for Employee
Assistance Programs.

00:46:36.130 --> 00:46:38.630
And that is essentially free
therapy, and you should use it.

00:46:38.630 --> 00:46:39.172
It's amazing.

00:46:39.172 --> 00:46:41.547
That's the one thing I miss
about working at the hospital

00:46:41.547 --> 00:46:42.130
system.

00:46:42.130 --> 00:46:43.060
Oh, EAPs.

00:46:43.060 --> 00:46:45.632
I have to pay cash
for my therapist now.

00:46:45.632 --> 00:46:46.870
Damn it.

00:46:46.870 --> 00:46:47.890
So those are great.

00:46:47.890 --> 00:46:51.640
And then also just I think
companies as a whole,

00:46:51.640 --> 00:46:53.500
it's the overall
feeling and support

00:46:53.500 --> 00:46:55.660
that people can get
from taking breaks.

00:46:55.660 --> 00:46:57.225
And I know we all
need to work more.

00:46:57.225 --> 00:46:59.350
And we have perfs, and all
this stuff is happening.

00:46:59.350 --> 00:47:01.030
It's like, I'm
always being judged,

00:47:01.030 --> 00:47:02.300
and I need to do better.

00:47:02.300 --> 00:47:03.820
And I want to get
this promotion.

00:47:03.820 --> 00:47:07.210
I think rewarding taking
a break, in some ways,

00:47:07.210 --> 00:47:09.010
would be helpful when needed.

00:47:09.010 --> 00:47:11.410
And it's almost like maybe
forced vacation days,

00:47:11.410 --> 00:47:14.410
like this two days every two
months or something, somebody

00:47:14.410 --> 00:47:16.330
has to take this time off.

00:47:16.330 --> 00:47:18.220
Because I was talking to--

00:47:18.220 --> 00:47:19.470
actually, someone at YouTube--

00:47:19.470 --> 00:47:21.670
Malik Ducard the other day.

00:47:21.670 --> 00:47:22.490
Such a nice guy.

00:47:22.490 --> 00:47:26.740
And he was talking about how his
friend was an Olympic athlete.

00:47:26.740 --> 00:47:27.630
I know.

00:47:27.630 --> 00:47:28.600
Crazy.

00:47:28.600 --> 00:47:31.960
And he was like, his friend was
telling him the huge difference

00:47:31.960 --> 00:47:35.680
between people who medal in
the Olympics and people who

00:47:35.680 --> 00:47:38.800
don't-- because they all
arguably compete at this crazy,

00:47:38.800 --> 00:47:40.310
intense level.

00:47:40.310 --> 00:47:42.310
The difference between
medaling and not medaling

00:47:42.310 --> 00:47:44.390
are the ones that know
when to take a break

00:47:44.390 --> 00:47:47.030
and when to let their body heal.

00:47:47.030 --> 00:47:49.760
And I think that that's a really
powerful, powerful message,

00:47:49.760 --> 00:47:51.670
especially when it
comes a mental health.

00:47:51.670 --> 00:47:55.330
From us doing great and
feeling on top of the world,

00:47:55.330 --> 00:47:58.358
crushing life, and surviving,
white knuckling it,

00:47:58.358 --> 00:47:59.650
is knowing when to take breaks.

00:47:59.650 --> 00:48:01.108
And I'm just as
guilty as you guys.

00:48:01.108 --> 00:48:04.120
Just because I'm a therapist
doesn't mean that I do better.

00:48:04.120 --> 00:48:06.370
It just means I know better,
which sometimes is worse.

00:48:06.370 --> 00:48:09.970
And so just allowing
people to take

00:48:09.970 --> 00:48:12.855
breaks because I think that
really can make the difference.

00:48:12.855 --> 00:48:14.980
AUDIENCE: But what about
Google not as an employer,

00:48:14.980 --> 00:48:16.780
but as a platform for the world?

00:48:16.780 --> 00:48:17.890
KATI MORTON: Oh yeah.

00:48:17.890 --> 00:48:19.030
YouTube as a whole?

00:48:19.030 --> 00:48:22.970
I mean, I might have a lot
of thoughts about that.

00:48:22.970 --> 00:48:25.150
That's its own talk.

00:48:25.150 --> 00:48:27.768
I think that YouTube as a
whole has really supported the,

00:48:27.768 --> 00:48:30.310
it's OK to be weird, it's OK to
talk about your issues thing.

00:48:30.310 --> 00:48:32.720
And I think that's what
makes YouTube so amazing.

00:48:32.720 --> 00:48:37.000
But I think as a creator
with mental health content,

00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:40.070
it's so hard to monetize.

00:48:40.070 --> 00:48:42.730
So it's really hard
for new people of--

00:48:42.730 --> 00:48:44.650
because I'm not going
to work for everybody.

00:48:44.650 --> 00:48:45.730
There's going to be--

00:48:45.730 --> 00:48:46.870
like I'm blonde-haired.

00:48:46.870 --> 00:48:48.130
I'm a white girl.

00:48:48.130 --> 00:48:50.270
I was born and raised
in Washington State.

00:48:50.270 --> 00:48:51.577
I have a feel to me.

00:48:51.577 --> 00:48:53.410
And just like we're
talking about therapists

00:48:53.410 --> 00:48:54.167
are all different.

00:48:54.167 --> 00:48:55.750
And there should be
a lot of different

00:48:55.750 --> 00:48:57.385
me's in a lot of
different avenues

00:48:57.385 --> 00:48:59.260
that come from a lot of
different backgrounds

00:48:59.260 --> 00:49:02.560
so that everybody feels
heard and understood.

00:49:02.560 --> 00:49:06.130
And if they can't monetize,
they can't live on YouTube.

00:49:06.130 --> 00:49:09.040
And I worry about that
because I definitely

00:49:09.040 --> 00:49:10.960
have my ins because I've
been on the platform

00:49:10.960 --> 00:49:12.220
for almost eight years.

00:49:12.220 --> 00:49:14.830
But the new people--
like there's a therapist,

00:49:14.830 --> 00:49:16.090
she just started out.

00:49:16.090 --> 00:49:17.780
I think she's out of Atlanta.

00:49:17.780 --> 00:49:22.120
She's great, but
I'm sure she's--

00:49:22.120 --> 00:49:24.850
most of her stuff, I never
see ads on her videos.

00:49:24.850 --> 00:49:28.030
She's been at it for six months.

00:49:28.030 --> 00:49:29.740
But that's really
the main issue,

00:49:29.740 --> 00:49:31.198
because I think
the more that we're

00:49:31.198 --> 00:49:34.420
able to monetize educational,
helpful information,

00:49:34.420 --> 00:49:38.430
the more we can live
on the platform.

00:49:38.430 --> 00:49:39.338
Cool?

00:49:39.338 --> 00:49:40.880
Thank you so much
for your attention.

00:49:40.880 --> 00:49:42.320
I hope it was helpful.

00:49:42.320 --> 00:49:43.820
If you have any
follow up questions,

00:49:43.820 --> 00:49:44.903
I'm all over social media.

00:49:44.903 --> 00:49:46.590
I do my best to answer
as much as I can.

00:49:46.590 --> 00:49:47.450
I have tons of videos.

00:49:47.450 --> 00:49:49.617
So if you have a question,
just YouTube Kati Morton.

00:49:49.617 --> 00:49:51.380
Insert question that you have.

00:49:51.380 --> 00:49:52.760
And yeah, thanks for coming.

00:49:52.760 --> 00:49:56.110
