strident convolutions is another piece

00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:03.929
strident convolutions is another piece
 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:05.650
strident convolutions is another piece
of the basic building block of

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:05.660
of the basic building block of
 

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:08.450
of the basic building block of
convolutions as used in convolutional

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460
convolutions as used in convolutional
 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.100
convolutions as used in convolutional
neural networks let me show you an

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110
neural networks let me show you an
 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.830
neural networks let me show you an
example let's say you want to convert

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840
example let's say you want to convert
 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.530
example let's say you want to convert
this seven by seven image with this D by

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540
this seven by seven image with this D by
 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.140
this seven by seven image with this D by
three filter except that instead of

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150
three filter except that instead of
 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:19.820
three filter except that instead of
doing in the usual way we're going to do

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830
doing in the usual way we're going to do
 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.380
doing in the usual way we're going to do
it with a stride of two what that means

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390
it with a stride of two what that means
 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.980
it with a stride of two what that means
is you take the element wise product as

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990
is you take the element wise product as
 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.109
is you take the element wise product as
usual in this upper left V by three

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119
usual in this upper left V by three
 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.170
usual in this upper left V by three
region and then multiply an ad and that

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180
region and then multiply an ad and that
 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.680
region and then multiply an ad and that
gives you ninety one but then instead of

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690
gives you ninety one but then instead of
 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.810
gives you ninety one but then instead of
stepping the blue box over by one step

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820
stepping the blue box over by one step
 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.240
stepping the blue box over by one step
we're going to step it over by two steps

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250
we're going to step it over by two steps
 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.660
we're going to step it over by two steps
so we're gonna make it hop over two

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670
so we're gonna make it hop over two
 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.450
so we're gonna make it hop over two
steps like so notice how the upper

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460
steps like so notice how the upper
 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.520
steps like so notice how the upper
left-hand corner has gone from dis dot

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530
left-hand corner has gone from dis dot
 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.189
left-hand corner has gone from dis dot
to dis stopped jumping over one position

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199
to dis stopped jumping over one position
 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.069
to dis stopped jumping over one position
and then you do the usual element wise

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079
and then you do the usual element wise
 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.319
and then you do the usual element wise
product and summing and that gives you

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329
product and summing and that gives you
 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.660
product and summing and that gives you
it turns out one hundred and now we're

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670
it turns out one hundred and now we're
 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.639
it turns out one hundred and now we're
going to do that again and make the blue

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649
going to do that again and make the blue
 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.939
going to do that again and make the blue
box jump over by two steps so you end up

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949
box jump over by two steps so you end up
 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.340
box jump over by two steps so you end up
there and that gives you eighty three

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350
there and that gives you eighty three
 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.330
there and that gives you eighty three
and now when you go to the NICS row you

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340
and now when you go to the NICS row you
 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.670
and now when you go to the NICS row you
again actually take two steps instead of

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680
again actually take two steps instead of
 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.940
again actually take two steps instead of
one step so going to move the blue box

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950
one step so going to move the blue box
 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.830
one step so going to move the blue box
over there notice how we're skipping

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840
over there notice how we're skipping
 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.780
over there notice how we're skipping
over one of the positions and then just

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790
over one of the positions and then just
 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.570
over one of the positions and then just
gives you 69 and now you gain step over

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580
gives you 69 and now you gain step over
 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.410
gives you 69 and now you gain step over
two steps this gives you 91 and so on

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420
two steps this gives you 91 and so on
 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.760
two steps this gives you 91 and so on
this 127 and then for the final row 44

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770
this 127 and then for the final row 44
 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:41.960
this 127 and then for the final row 44
72 and 74 so in this example we convolve

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970
72 and 74 so in this example we convolve
 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.630
72 and 74 so in this example we convolve
with a 7 by 7 matrix with a 3 by 3

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640
with a 7 by 7 matrix with a 3 by 3
 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.910
with a 7 by 7 matrix with a 3 by 3
matrix and we get a 3 by 3 output so the

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920
matrix and we get a 3 by 3 output so the
 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.950
matrix and we get a 3 by 3 output so the
input and output dimensions turns out to

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960
input and output dimensions turns out to
 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.050
input and output dimensions turns out to
be governed by the following formula if

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060
be governed by the following formula if
 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.810
be governed by the following formula if
you have an N by n image they involved

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820
you have an N by n image they involved
 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.010
you have an N by n image they involved
with an F by F filter and if you use

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020
with an F by F filter and if you use
 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:09.229
with an F by F filter and if you use
padding P and stride s so in this

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239
padding P and stride s so in this
 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:12.110
padding P and stride s so in this
example s is equal to 2 then you end up

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120
example s is equal to 2 then you end up
 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.480
example s is equal to 2 then you end up
with an output

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:13.490
with an output
 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:18.520
with an output
that is n plus 2 P minus F and now

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530
that is n plus 2 P minus F and now
 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.260
that is n plus 2 P minus F and now
because you're stepping s steps at the

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:20.270
because you're stepping s steps at the
 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:22.840
because you're stepping s steps at the
time this of just one step at a time you

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:22.850
time this of just one step at a time you
 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:25.690
time this of just one step at a time you
know you you now divided by s plus one

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700
know you you now divided by s plus one
 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:30.640
know you you now divided by s plus one
and then by the same thing so in our

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650
and then by the same thing so in our
 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:38.650
and then by the same thing so in our
example we have 7 plus 0 minus 3 divided

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660
example we have 7 plus 0 minus 3 divided
 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.600
example we have 7 plus 0 minus 3 divided
by 2

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610
by 2
 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:45.490
by 2
let's try plus 1 equals let's see that's

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500
let's try plus 1 equals let's see that's
 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:50.380
let's try plus 1 equals let's see that's
4 over 2 plus 1 equals 3 which is why we

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390
4 over 2 plus 1 equals 3 which is why we
 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:55.240
4 over 2 plus 1 equals 3 which is why we
wound up with this V by 3 Oakland now

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250
wound up with this V by 3 Oakland now
 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:58.240
wound up with this V by 3 Oakland now
just one last detail which is 1 of this

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250
just one last detail which is 1 of this
 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:02.800
just one last detail which is 1 of this
fraction is not an integer in that case

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810
fraction is not an integer in that case
 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:06.250
fraction is not an integer in that case
we're going to round this down so this

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260
we're going to round this down so this
 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.100
we're going to round this down so this
notation denotes the 4 of something so

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:09.110
notation denotes the 4 of something so
 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:13.600
notation denotes the 4 of something so
this right this is also called the floor

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:13.610
this right this is also called the floor
 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:16.540
this right this is also called the floor
of Z it means taking Z and rounding down

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:16.550
of Z it means taking Z and rounding down
 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:19.510
of Z it means taking Z and rounding down
to the nearest integer and if the way

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:19.520
to the nearest integer and if the way
 

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:21.550
to the nearest integer and if the way
this is implemented is that you take

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560
this is implemented is that you take
 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.980
this is implemented is that you take
this type of blue box multiplication the

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:23.990
this type of blue box multiplication the
 

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:25.840
this type of blue box multiplication the
only of the blue box is fully contained

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:25.850
only of the blue box is fully contained
 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:28.270
only of the blue box is fully contained
within the image or the image posted

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280
within the image or the image posted

having and if any of this blue box kind

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.040
having and if any of this blue box kind
 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.760
having and if any of this blue box kind
of part of it hangs outside and you just

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:33.770
of part of it hangs outside and you just
 

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:36.670
of part of it hangs outside and you just
do not do that computation then it turns

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:36.680
do not do that computation then it turns
 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:39.610
do not do that computation then it turns
out that if that's a convention that

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:39.620
out that if that's a convention that
 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:42.160
out that if that's a convention that
you're you know 3 by 3 filter must lie

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:42.170
you're you know 3 by 3 filter must lie
 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:44.590
you're you know 3 by 3 filter must lie
entirely within your image or the image

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:44.600
entirely within your image or the image
 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:47.200
entirely within your image or the image
plus the having region before there's a

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:47.210
plus the having region before there's a
 

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:49.090
plus the having region before there's a
corresponding output generator if that's

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:49.100
corresponding output generator if that's
 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:53.140
corresponding output generator if that's
convention then the right thing to do

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:53.150
convention then the right thing to do
 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:55.510
convention then the right thing to do
for the to computing output dimension is

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:55.520
for the to computing output dimension is
 

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:59.200
for the to computing output dimension is
to round down in case this n plus 2 P

00:03:59.200 --> 00:03:59.210
to round down in case this n plus 2 P
 

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:02.470
to round down in case this n plus 2 P
minus F over s is not an integer so just

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:02.480
minus F over s is not an integer so just
 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:04.570
minus F over s is not an integer so just
to summarize the dimensions if you have

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:04.580
to summarize the dimensions if you have
 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:07.270
to summarize the dimensions if you have
an N by n matrix or n by n image that

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280
an N by n matrix or n by n image that
 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.280
an N by n matrix or n by n image that
you convolved with an F by F matrix and

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:09.290
you convolved with an F by F matrix and
 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:12.730
you convolved with an F by F matrix and
that by a filter repair a phys then the

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:12.740
that by a filter repair a phys then the
 

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:16.060
that by a filter repair a phys then the
output size will have this dimension

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:16.070
output size will have this dimension
 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:18.430
output size will have this dimension
and you know it is nice we can choose

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:18.440
and you know it is nice we can choose
 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:20.290
and you know it is nice we can choose
all of these numbers so that that isn't

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:20.300
all of these numbers so that that isn't
 

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:22.960
all of these numbers so that that isn't
integer although sometimes you don't

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:22.970
integer although sometimes you don't
 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:25.000
integer although sometimes you don't
have to do that and rounding down this

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:25.010
have to do that and rounding down this
 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:29.500
have to do that and rounding down this
is just fine as well but please feel

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:29.510
is just fine as well but please feel
 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:31.810
is just fine as well but please feel
free to work through a few examples of

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:31.820
free to work through a few examples of
 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:35.020
free to work through a few examples of
values of n F P and s for yourself to

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:35.030

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:22.960

in mathematics and this is nice for some

00:07:59.830 --> 00:07:59.840
in mathematics and this is nice for some
 

00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:02.080

signal processing applications but for

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:02.090
signal processing applications but for
 

00:08:02.090 --> 00:08:03.970

deep neural networks it really doesn't

00:08:03.970 --> 00:08:03.980
deep neural networks it really doesn't

matter and so omitting this double
