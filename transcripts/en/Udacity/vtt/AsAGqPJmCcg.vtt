00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Let's start by calculating the final kinetic energy using mgh for the gravitational potential energy.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Once again we start with conservation of energy.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
The idea that the kinetic energy and the potential energy always add up to the same value

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
no matter what point we're at in our experiment.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Now, we know that the ball starts off with no initial velocity.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
We can say that the initial kinetic energy is 0.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
And we know that the ball lands on the ground at height 0, so the final potential energy is also 0.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
This gives us that the final kinetic energy is just equal to the original potential energy

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:37.000
which is equal to mgh and plugging in the values 50 m, 9.8 m/sÂ², and 1 kg,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
we get that the final kinetic energy is 490 J.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Now let's repeat that calculation except this time we'll use

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
the more general formula for gravitational potential energy.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Once again we start with conservation of energy.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
And just like last time, the initial kinetic energy is 0.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Now this time, we can't say that the final potential energy is 0

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
because our formula is slightly different.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.000
In fact, this formula is only ever equal to 0 when R gets really, really, really, really, really, really light.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
And that's not going to happen any time in our problem.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
We can't ever say that the potential energy is 0.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
But we can still do the math and solving for final kinetic energy

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000
we get that the difference between the original potential energy and the final potential energy.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
And we can now plug in our formula for those to get this equation.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
And inserting our known values into this equation, we get that the final kinetic energy

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
using this version of the gravitational potential energy is 486 J.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Not bad. That's actually quite close to 490.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
And using these values to calculate the percent error,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
I get that my percent error for the final kinetic energy is 0.76%.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:46.000
That's not bad at all. So really mgh is pretty good for calculating gravitational potential energy

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000
over distances like 50 m but as we'll see later if we need to do much larger distances

00:01:51.000 --> 99:59:59.000
we'll have to use this version of gravitational potential energy.
