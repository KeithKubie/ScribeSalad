Speaker 1:          00:00          And have you ever heard the theory that octopus are from out of space? Yeah, we talked about that. Ryan Cox the other day. Yeah. I'm not, I'm not super well read on it, but like it looks like a damn alien. Yeah, he was very incredulous. Uh, but you know, he's obviously smarter than both of us. Right. So, so he gets to me. Yeah. It's like me looking at tackling man, it doesn't make sense. Of course it doesn't make sense. I'm stupid. But he's, he's, you know, we were looking at this eye, but this is apparently like peer reviewed published paper about the possibility of octopus being reintroduced and I think it has something to do with the way RNA and DNA is right on them. Right. I know. I don't understand it well, but yes, it's like the thought that the population came from out of space because of the DNA sequencing and suggest something that makes it extra terrestrial adaptability.

Speaker 1:          00:47          Yeah. He was super skeptical because he was saying that they're essentially so close to everything else here. It doesn't make sense. But the other theory was it might be just this is the path of life. Right. And the reason why it's so close to us is that this is the way all life, even if it's extra terrestrial, sure gets established. Sure. I don't believe octopus from out of space, but I love the theory. I love the idea of it. It looks like it's from out of space. You know, it's just wacky. Well, it's such a cool thought. Yeah. You know, that these things came from out of spaces, so. Well that's also a thought about silicide mushrooms from the weirder people that they came, uh, on asteroids and their spores. I've heard that. Yeah. And they've, I don't know if you know this, but they've proven that certain, I don't know about psilocybins, but certain mushroom spores are impenetrable to the vacuum of space.

Speaker 1:          01:30          Yeah. They can survive. Yeah. That's, that's bananas. I pick a lot of mushrooms, not psilocybins, but I'm a lot of porcine, a lot of chanterelles. Like I, I do a lot of farming. It's really fun. Are you aware of Paul Stamets? No, I don't know that. He's amazing, man. One of my favorite podcasts ever. He's a mycologist a fucking trip in every sense of the word. Huh? As super genius. Mycologist who's the craziest story about being in high school and what did he say? Took 20 grams of mushrooms and climbed a tree, a lightning storm or something. Fucking something where you hear him tell the story in your hands. Start sweating. No Way. Grams or 10 grams or 20 grand, like something fucking bananas. Like some that would kill Moose. Yeah. Well it wouldn't kill it, but it would definitely make it think it's on a moose anymore and it essentially changed his life.

Speaker 1:          02:19          Stopped him from stuttering. He used to stutter and he did this and he stops done. No Way. Yeah. I've heard about guys that micro dose with mushrooms with psilocybins and it, it heightens their focus and curious or autism and you know, there's, I'm not very well read on that, but there's a whole idea that micro dosing with these chemicals that are naturally produced can actually have very positive effects. Yeah. There's quite a few people who do that. That's really common. Yeah. Yeah. I've talked to a lot of people that do that really goes with that. And they also microdose with LSD. There's a lot of that. Really not, yeah. A lot of silicon valley people are microdosing with LSD. It's funny because the one person that I know that's done the microdosing mushrooms from silicone valley, yeah. People grind them up into pill form. And in fact a lot of fighters are doing that now.

Speaker 1:          03:03          Really, really strange. Yeah. So what would that, why would that help you? Like as a fighter? Is it, it's not a mental focus thing. It's a, it's a physical thing at that point right now it's gets you into the flow state. Interesting. And so like with fighters, the real thing is, um, it's not just your skill, but it's your ability to execute that skill under pressure. All right? So there's an overwhelming amount of anxiety. There's extreme consequences to getting hit or going wrong. Getting knocked out. The losing a fight is absolutely devastating. It's devastating. Emotionally is devastating physically. It's devastating. Psychologically. It changes your perception of who you are and how you fit into the world. And, um, that sometimes, and not, I shouldn't say sometimes oftentimes impedes performance kind of come back from it kind of thing. Well it's not just that the, the consequences of it possibly go wrong, make you hesitate and it just, it's the stress of it all is very constricting.

Speaker 1:          03:59          It's very difficult to operate under that stress. Sure. The mushrooms for some people alleviate that stress and put you in this elevated state where they say, and I haven't, I've never fought on mushrooms, but they say that when you're on mushrooms you actually can see what a guy's going to do before he does it. Interest. You have a sense of what they're going to do. That's a much more heightened sense than you would if you were just in a normal sober state. So are you picking, do you think you're picking that up through like biological cues? Like you could see the muscles twitching in the arm before the punch comes or like what, how do you think that a good question. I haven't done it. I don't know. You know, I've never sparred on mushrooms are like a good idea. That's a really common, they say it is a good idea that the guys who do it love it.

Speaker 1:          04:41          Yeah. Interest and guys of like, you know, had some really extreme positive results. Huh? Yeah. That's fascinating. I never thought as an athletic performer that athletic enhancement, that would be a thing. Yeah. It's, it's not just the, I mean, I don't think it makes you move faster or hit stronger, hit harder. But I think what it does is it puts you in the zone. Interesting. There's, there's states that you get into where you just, you can't do no wrong and either usually very elusive. They come and they go, you know, you get them like, um, do you ever play pool? I did a little bit. I mean, but you know how sometimes you play pool for a few hours and then you just also, you feel you can't miss. Yeah. He just have this feeling of where everything's going to go. That's even if you're not very good.

Speaker 1:          05:23          Sometimes those, those will conflict to tree shots, the zone. Sure. You know, and, um, that elusive state of like re, and then sometimes you're like, wow, I can't believe I'm in the zone. Then it goes away, you know, maintaining that flow state. What do you think it takes emotions out of it? Like is that, is that why you're in that state? Like if you're not emotionally attached to that shot or that punch, maybe you can execute it better? It's possible. I mean, there's a lot of speculation of what's going on, what's causing this elevated state of consciousness. It's interesting. Yeah. I don't know. Maybe I'll just start microdosing on mushrooms and going out to chase snakes around. Maybe, maybe you would be more in tune with the environment or maybe I'd get bitten and die. That's true too.
