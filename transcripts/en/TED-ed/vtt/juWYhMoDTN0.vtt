00:00:17.852 --> 00:00:21.094
It's March the 17th in A.D. 73.

00:00:21.118 --> 00:00:24.288
We're visiting ancient Rome
to watch the Liberalia,

00:00:24.312 --> 00:00:28.956
an annual festival that celebrates
the liberty of Rome's citizens.

00:00:30.418 --> 00:00:36.251
We're looking in at a 17-year-old
named Lucius Popidius Secundus.

00:00:36.275 --> 00:00:41.111
He's not from a poor family, but he lives
in the region known as the Subura,

00:00:41.135 --> 00:00:45.550
a poorer neighborhood in Rome,
yet close to the center of the city.

00:00:45.574 --> 00:00:46.574
(Gong)

00:00:48.084 --> 00:00:50.525
The tenants of these
apartments are crammed in,

00:00:50.549 --> 00:00:51.550
(Grunting)

00:00:51.574 --> 00:00:53.629
which poses considerable risk.

00:00:54.851 --> 00:01:00.225
Fires are frequent and the smell of ash
and smoke in the morning is not uncommon.

00:01:01.635 --> 00:01:06.274
Lucius, who awoke at dawn,
has family duties to perform today.

00:01:07.772 --> 00:01:08.785
(Cheering)

00:01:08.809 --> 00:01:11.367
His 15-year-old brother is coming of age.

00:01:12.302 --> 00:01:16.812
Half the children in ancient Rome
die before they reach adulthood,

00:01:16.836 --> 00:01:20.106
so this is a particularly
important milestone.

00:01:20.702 --> 00:01:23.970
Lucius watches his brother
stand in his new toga

00:01:23.994 --> 00:01:27.459
before the household shrine
with its protective deities,

00:01:27.483 --> 00:01:31.440
as he places his bulla,
a protective amulet,

00:01:31.464 --> 00:01:33.790
in the shrine with a prayer of thanks.

00:01:35.737 --> 00:01:38.237
The bulla had worked.
It had protected him.

00:01:39.118 --> 00:01:43.256
Unlike many others,
he had survived to become an adult.

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:49.778
At 17, Lucius has almost
completed his education.

00:01:49.802 --> 00:01:53.035
He has learned to speak well,
make public speeches,

00:01:53.059 --> 00:01:56.159
and how to read and write
both Latin and Greek.

00:01:57.088 --> 00:01:59.873
His father has taught him
the types of things

00:01:59.897 --> 00:02:02.389
you can't learn in the classroom:

00:02:02.413 --> 00:02:04.142
how to run,

00:02:04.166 --> 00:02:06.832
how to swim,

00:02:06.856 --> 00:02:08.270
and how to fight.

00:02:08.294 --> 00:02:13.394
Lucius could choose, at 17,
to become a military tribune

00:02:13.418 --> 00:02:15.772
and command soldiers
on the edge of the Empire.

00:02:18.068 --> 00:02:22.008
But in other ways,
Lucius is still a child.

00:02:22.032 --> 00:02:24.871
He's not trusted
to arrange business deals.

00:02:24.895 --> 00:02:28.386
His father will take care
of that until he is 25.

00:02:30.335 --> 00:02:35.430
And Dad will arrange Lucius' marriage
to a girl 10 years younger.

00:02:36.436 --> 00:02:41.026
His dad has his eye on a family
with a 7-year-old daughter.

00:02:41.685 --> 00:02:43.229
Back to the Liberalia.

00:02:43.253 --> 00:02:45.409
As Lucius leaves with his family,

00:02:45.433 --> 00:02:49.058
the shops are open as the population
goes about its business.

00:02:50.588 --> 00:02:54.511
The streets are full
of itinerant traders selling trinkets

00:02:54.535 --> 00:02:56.902
and people bustling from place to place.

00:02:57.801 --> 00:03:02.254
Large wagons are not allowed
in the city until after the ninth hour

00:03:02.278 --> 00:03:04.235
but the streets are still crowded.

00:03:06.183 --> 00:03:10.328
Fathers and uncles
take the kids to the Forum Augustus

00:03:10.352 --> 00:03:13.157
to see statues of Rome's famous warriors

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:18.243
like Aeneas, who led Rome's ancestors,
the Trojans, to Italy.

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:20.932
And Romulus, Rome's founder.

00:03:21.948 --> 00:03:25.677
And all the great generals of the Republic
from more than 100 years earlier.

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:30.861
Lovingly, we can imagine
fathers and guardians

00:03:30.885 --> 00:03:33.444
with their now adult children

00:03:33.468 --> 00:03:36.664
remembering stories of Rome's glory

00:03:36.688 --> 00:03:40.578
and re-telling the good deeds and sayings
of the great men of the past:

00:03:41.356 --> 00:03:43.688
lessons on how to live well,

00:03:43.712 --> 00:03:46.560
and to overcome the follies of youth.

00:03:47.674 --> 00:03:51.835
There is a sense of history in this place,
relevant to their present.

00:03:53.354 --> 00:03:57.806
Romans made an empire
without end in time and space.

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:58.831
(Thump)

00:03:58.855 --> 00:04:01.518
Rome was destined to be
eternal through warfare.

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:06.879
Wars were a fact of life, even in A.D. 73.

00:04:06.903 --> 00:04:10.994
There are campaigns in the north
of England and into Scotland,

00:04:11.018 --> 00:04:13.678
to the north of the River
Danube into Romania,

00:04:13.702 --> 00:04:18.583
and on the frontier
between Syria and Iraq to the east.

00:04:18.607 --> 00:04:22.249
It's now the eighth hour --
time to head for the baths.

00:04:22.273 --> 00:04:26.461
Lucius and his family head up
the Via Lata, the wide street,

00:04:26.485 --> 00:04:30.396
to the Campus Martius,
and the enormous Baths of Agrippa.

00:04:31.684 --> 00:04:35.403
The family members leave
the clients and freedmen outside,

00:04:35.427 --> 00:04:37.761
and enter the baths with their peer group.

00:04:38.981 --> 00:04:43.109
Baths would change from dark,
steamy rooms to light ones.

00:04:44.149 --> 00:04:46.212
The Romans had perfected window glass.

00:04:47.768 --> 00:04:51.311
Everyone moves from the cold room

00:04:51.335 --> 00:04:52.548
to the tepid room

00:04:53.959 --> 00:04:55.942
and to the very hot room.

00:04:55.966 --> 00:04:57.149
(Man) Oops!

00:04:57.173 --> 00:05:00.577
More than an hour later, the bathers leave

00:05:00.601 --> 00:05:02.807
massaged, oiled,

00:05:02.831 --> 00:05:03.973
(Whistling)

00:05:03.997 --> 00:05:06.731
and have been scraped down with a strigil

00:05:06.755 --> 00:05:08.321
to remove the remaining dirt.

00:05:10.066 --> 00:05:14.126
At the ninth hour, seven hours
after they left home,

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:16.648
the men return for a celebratory dinner.

00:05:17.829 --> 00:05:20.278
Dinner is an intimate affair,

00:05:20.302 --> 00:05:24.072
with nine people
reclining around the low table.

00:05:25.085 --> 00:05:27.428
Slaves attend to their every need

00:05:27.452 --> 00:05:32.075
if the diners, through gestures,
demand more food and wine.

00:05:33.675 --> 00:05:38.223
As the day closes, we can hear
the rumble of wagons outside.

00:05:38.247 --> 00:05:39.646
The clients and freedmen,

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:43.796
with a meal of robust
-- if inferior -- food inside them,

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:46.028
shuffle off to the now tepid baths

00:05:46.052 --> 00:05:48.240
before returning
to their apartment blocks.

00:05:49.453 --> 00:05:54.345
Back at Lucius' house,
the drinking continues into the night.

00:05:54.369 --> 00:05:57.346
Lucius and his stepbrother
don't look too well.

00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:01.866
A slave stands by in case
either of them needs to vomit.

00:06:05.051 --> 00:06:07.910
With hindsight, we know Lucius' future.

00:06:07.934 --> 00:06:13.345
In 20 years' time, the Emperor Vespasian's
youngest son, Domitian, as emperor,

00:06:13.369 --> 00:06:14.997
will enact a reign of terror.

00:06:15.021 --> 00:06:17.237
Will Lucius survive?

00:06:17.261 --> 00:06:19.150
(Drums)
