Hey it's me Destin. Welcome back to Smarter Every Day. So ah

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:08.180
first things first, let me show you that this weapon is unloaded. And I really like to

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:12.230
think about firearms because there's a lot of science involved here. What causes muzzle

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:16.410
flash. Alright number one. We have powder inside the cartridge that's

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:20.530
burning, that gas is expanding. It has to overcome the bullet to barrel friction

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.710
here, in the barrel, and it has to accellerate the mass of the bullet,

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:28.890
while pushing out the column of air that was inside the barrel. There's a lot of science there.

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:33.070
So, muzzle flash is affected by the cartridge load and the barrel

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.260
length if you think about it. Another thing that comes into play for muzzle flash

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.450
is the geometry of the exit. Now, this is just a plain right circular

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:45.560
cylinder so you get a toroidal vortex, but if you think about something like this,

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:49.690
you've got a fluted exit here at the muzzle you'll get more of a starburst pattern.

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.790
Over the past year I've been playing around and I have perfected I think a way of taking muzzle flash

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:57.970
photos. It involves this, which is a piezoelectric transducer

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:02.150
mounted to a wooden box, and I use that to convert acoustic energy to

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:06.180
an electrical pulse, which I then send through a pulse generator. And if you don't know what this is, I'll

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.230
leave a link in the video description here. So I then take that output pulse from the pulse

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.290
generator to create a flash and take a high speed photo. Now why would I

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.340
want to do that you ask. Answer? Because it's awesome. I mean look at that.

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.400
But after a while it gets kind of strange taking experimental photos of yourself

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.520
with firearms all the time, so I invited some friends down to Alabama, that you

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:30.690
might recognise, to take photos with me.
OK

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:34.860
OK I changed it, and we're gonna see the kick, instead of the muzzle

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.650
flash. I delayed my flash.

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:43.240
Alright you ready to kill the lights buzz?
-Yessir.
Alright, hold on.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:47.290
Just , just so I know, what do you think you're gonna look like?
-American hero.

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.390
Alright. Kill lights. Ready for the count?

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:55.570
-Ready.
5..4..3..

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:59.700
[gunshot]
-Well?

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:03.890
Let's see.
-From my end that looked good. [laugh]

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:07.930
Yep it looked real good over here.
-No I'm serious. It was like it was a flash of

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.970
like, American pride.
Let's put this on your website.

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:16.150
-They're gonna sell posters of this.
-Oh my goodness.

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.200
-Oh.. oh.. That's not what I was expecting.
[laugh]

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.380
-You afraid of the dark? I'm goin with your camera dude.

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.570
-There's like two of you. You're like you're ah

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.680
-What's going on there?
-You can put it on your website. That's all that matters man.

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.840
-That camera's broke dude. You should take that into the shop.
OK now we're gonna do the

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:41.030
same thing, only instead of a revolver or pistol, we're gonna use a

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:45.220
.50 cal? -.50 caliber
Yep. So this is Michael from V sauce and this is a

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:49.280
Safety Harbor .50 cal. It's not the Beowulf round it's the BMG round

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:53.310
so we've got a AR-15 lower, Safety Harbor upper and a whole lot of

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:57.330
awesome.
Arm? -Armed.
Alright.

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:01.520
3..2..1.. [gunshot]

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.710
-Did you see the flash go?
Flash went. -Nice.

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:09.890
Nice. So uh

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:14.070
That's a little bit of muzzle flash. I mean, it's not like an amazing amount.

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:18.240
You know I mean, that's probably less than you're used to. -We could do better

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:22.410
I think we could do better.
-Well look at that. Look what the flash did. It made that smoke cloud

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:26.590
more opaque.
On the bottom right of the quantum composer, hit the blue button

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:30.730
-Blinking.
Alright. Come back over here and I'll put the

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:34.830
round in the barrel. -Ready?
Yep. -Alright.

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:39.020
-and 3..2..1.. [gunshot]

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:43.180
Awesome. -Wow.

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.350
This is kind of like a man test, if you can do this with your eyes open.
-Look how

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:51.430
open your eyes are.
Well yeah, I mean come on. [laughs]

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:55.480
So there's a handful of you out there thinking well why don't you just take the output from the piezo

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:59.550
and run it through a MOS FET or something like that. You can vary the threshold on

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:03.730
that MOS FET and then send a trigger to your flash. Why don't you do that Destin? Answer,

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:07.900
because I like taking pictures of the bullet itself. That's why. This thing has a really really

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:12.000
fine temporal resolution. It's like 25 picoseconds. So another thing you might

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:16.160
deal with is bullet blur. Bullet blur is calculated by the velocity of the bullet as it exits

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:20.200
the weapon, multiplied times the the flash duration. Now there's two ways to

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:24.380
decrease the bullet blur. The first way is a faster flash, and the second way is to

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:28.560
turn the weapon more acutely so that you're only dealing with the cosine of that bullet

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:32.630
velocity rather than the full bullet velocity. Now that's cool, but

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:36.790
there's something you have to do if you do that. You have to use a remote trigger, because

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:40.900
one of the major rules of gun safety is never be down-range of a weapon. So make sure

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:45.070
you do that. Use common sense any time you do experimentation like this. So there you are, now you're

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:49.240
trained on how to take really cool muzzle flash photos. Do not do this if you and

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:53.420
everyone around you is not heavily trained in weapons safety. Even if you are trained,

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:57.540
just keep in mind, accidents do happen so use common sense.

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:01.610
That is amazing, I didn't think we could do that. I did not think this would stop the bullet.

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:05.800
but it did
