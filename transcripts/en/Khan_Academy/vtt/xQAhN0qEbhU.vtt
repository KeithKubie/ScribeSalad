00:00:01.166 --> 00:00:04.700
- Hello and welcome to the LearnStorm

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:06.910
growth mindset live stream.

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:09.700
I'm Rachel, a senior
communications manager

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:12.820
at Khan Academy, and I am
so excited to welcome you

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:17.690
to the Khan Academy offices
here in sunny California.

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:20.870
Today's live stream is
gonna be about 60 minutes,

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:23.480
and we're gonna split
it up into two parts.

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.660
Up first, we're gonna cover
the LearnStorm program,

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.030
what it's all about, and what
it can do for your classroom.

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:34.750
Next, we'll turn our attention
to our fabulous panel

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:37.690
to answer your questions
about growth mindset.

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:39.800
But first, a few tips.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.080
If you have any questions
about growth mindset

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:47.160
or LearnStorm please type
your questions and comments,

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.930
and our helpful moderators
will answer your questions.

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:53.020
For those who are trying
to view by YouTube,

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:55.830
I'm really sorry, we're having
some technical problems,

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:57.880
so we're just on Facebook for the moment,

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:02.350
but our questions might be
asked to our panel later on.

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:06.370
I also very much recommend
that you maximize your screen.

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:07.980
We'll be going through a few of

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:09.670
the growth mindset activities,

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:12.350
and you'll definitely want
to see them in full effect.

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:15.880
And lastly, if you can't stay
for the full live stream,

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.490
we'll miss you, but don't
worry, we'll record it,

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.740
and we'll send out the
recording later on this week.

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:25.200
I have three amazing guests with me today

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.720
that I'll introduce in just a few moments.

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.630
But first let me share with
you a little about LearnStorm.

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:35.520
LearnStorm is Khan Academy's
free back-to-school program.

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.560
It gives teachers a powerful way

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.770
to jumpstart the school year.

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.790
By combining mindset
activities and skills practice

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:46.780
across subjects, LearnStorm
motivates classrooms

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:48.610
and builds students' confidence.

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:51.460
And yes, you can still
sign up for LearnStorm

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:55.130
through October, so hop to
it if you haven't already.

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:58.640
There's also some time to
win some awesome prizes.

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.310
This year all across the US,
teachers and their students

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.370
can sign up for LearnStorm.

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:08.500
LearnStorm and Khan Academy
are free, and always will be.

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.200
LearnStorm was possible thanks to

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.583
the awesome support of MathWorks,
so thank you MathWorks.

00:02:14.583 --> 00:02:18.120
LearnStorm can be implemented
flexibly by teachers

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.570
as in-class practice, for
homework, or for both,

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:26.080
but in order to get the
most out of LearnStorm

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.010
please follow these steps.

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:30.480
One, sign up and assign.

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.980
Two, master skills.

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.520
Three, build mindsets.

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.610
And four, celebrate progress.

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.350
Of course, in order to even participate

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:43.260
you must sign up for Khan Academy

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.530
by going to khanacademy.org,

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:49.040
and enroll in LearnStorm
from your coach dashboard.

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.530
Once you have your account all set up

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.100
with your class and students,

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:56.260
teachers can assign all
the content available

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.840
on Khan Academy, including
grammar, history, biology.

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.270
Not just math.

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:04.023
In addition to core K through 12 subjects,

00:03:05.979 --> 00:03:08.850
LearnStorm includes
access to Khan AP lessons

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:12.210
created by former AP teachers
and AP exam reviewers

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:15.230
covering subjects like
AP physics, AP calculus,

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:17.350
AP government and politics, and more.

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:20.500
And then don't forget to enroll
your class in LearnStorm.

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.650
Next, it's time for your
students to master skills.

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:26.680
Regardless of the way your teachers decide

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.310
to implement LearnStorm,

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:30.410
teachers can track student participation,

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:34.880
get real-time insight when
someone is struggling.

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.919
This enables teachers to spend more time

00:03:37.919 --> 00:03:41.330
differentiating instruction
and providing targeted help

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:43.023
with learners of all levels.

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:49.050
This picture is of Ms. Kotto
of Wastsonville, California.

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:51.100
She participated in LearnStorm last year,

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:53.120
and you can hear all about her experience

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:57.780
on our website at
learnstorm.khanacademy.org.

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:02.653
Thirdly, the topic of
the hour, growth mindset.

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:05.530
This year, based on feedback

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:07.860
from teachers who used
activities last year,

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:12.860
we have not one, but two
curriculums based on age group.

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.820
In the elementary/middle
school curriculum students have

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:19.760
seven activities to learn
alongside this brain character,

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:22.610
Thinky Pinky and his friends.

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:25.640
We'll scroll through one of
these awesome activities now,

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:27.730
which were created in
partnership with PERTS,

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:30.180
a standard research center.

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:32.620
Each activity has articles, videos,

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:34.670
and these are essential reflection points

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:36.320
where students can really take a moment

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:39.940
to internalize and apply
these concepts to their lives.

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:41.130
In the high school curriculum,

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:43.630
students have new lessons on belonging

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:46.220
and will learn through
testimonials and case studies.

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:48.630
We also have focus on highlighting people

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:51.500
from many different backgrounds
and diverse experiences

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:55.680
so students can learn from a
full spectrum of experiences.

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:57.700
We've also made a
comprehensive teacher guide

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:59.640
and lesson plans that
include bell ringers,

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:03.170
class discussions, sample
communications to parents.

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:05.450
You can assign all of these
growth mindset activities

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:08.290
by clicking assign in the
upper right-hand corner.

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:10.030
And as students complete activities

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:12.470
they develop learning
strategies and build confidence

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:15.333
to overcome challenges in
the classroom, and beyond.

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:19.060
The growth mindset activities
are a chance for you

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:21.550
to make a lasting change
in students' lives,

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:23.250
and as they continue into adulthood,

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:25.780
which is so very important.

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:30.330
Lastly, the cherry on
the sundae, celebrating.

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:31.810
The biggest part of LearnStorm,

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:34.840
which has led to many
classroom celebrations,

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:36.570
is the LearnStorm tracker.

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:38.270
Here's how it works.

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:41.470
Access the LearnStorm tracker
from the LearnStorm banner

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:43.520
on your teacher coach dashboard.

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:45.070
Once you click on the blue button

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:47.570
you should be taken to your
class LearnStorm tracker.

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:50.800
We've included a demo for you
to see what it's all about.

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:52.220
As your students complete assignments

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:55.770
on Khan Academy which
are assigned to them,

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:57.130
the rings on the LearnStorm tracker

00:05:57.130 --> 00:05:58.810
will populate and fill up.

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:00.320
Once your students have completed a set

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:01.370
of number of assignments

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:03.450
based on the number of
students in your class

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:06.470
the ring will fill up and
celebrations will occur.

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:10.230
This year there are a near
infinite number of rings

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:13.330
which means there are so
many moments for celebration,

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:16.450
encouragement, or perhaps
friendly competition

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:18.450
between a neighboring class (laughs).

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:20.350
Each ring is three-times the number

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:22.170
of students in your class.

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:25.330
Students get super excited
regardless of the age,

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:26.540
and we've even seen students

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:29.320
jump out of their seats in celebration.

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:32.091
For a limited time, LearnStorm,

00:06:32.091 --> 00:06:35.057
(mumbling) LearnStorm, we
have growth mindset activities

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:38.170
that you can also assign to your class

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:41.210
to receive credit in
your LearnStorm tracker.

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:43.970
Alright, enough from me.

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:47.190
I am very excited to introduce our panel

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:49.860
who will tell us more
about growth mindset.

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:53.940
Alright, today we have Dave Paunesku

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:58.290
founding director of PERTS, a
center at Stanford University

00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:00.830
that helps educators apply insights

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:03.130
from the behavioral
sciences to create safe

00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:05.120
and engaging learning environments

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:08.790
that foster student
motivation and resilience.

00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:11.370
Annie Brock, a former teacher,

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:13.860
and author of The Growth Mindset Coach,

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:15.780
a month-by-month guide of how

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:18.731
to implement mindset in your classroom.

00:07:18.731 --> 00:07:22.700
And Samala Robinson, a
current fourth-grade teacher

00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:25.750
in Independence, Missouri,
who has developed

00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:29.090
many creative ways to help her
student's learning mindsets.

00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:30.973
So, welcome to our panel.

00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:35.580
So, my first question is for Dave.

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:38.880
Can you tell us more of
what is growth mindset?

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:41.270
- Yeah, so growth mindset is really

00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:44.170
the belief that our abilities
and our intelligence

00:07:44.170 --> 00:07:46.690
are something that we can
grow by applying effort

00:07:48.750 --> 00:07:51.330
appropriately to the right
kinds of learning strategies.

00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:53.930
And it's distinguished
usually from a fixed mindset,

00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:56.379
which is the belief that our abilities

00:07:56.379 --> 00:07:57.343
and our intelligence are fixed.

00:07:57.343 --> 00:07:59.030
That they're something like eye color.

00:07:59.030 --> 00:08:02.480
Something that we really
can't change about ourselves.

00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:04.230
Now, it's important to
note that growth mindset

00:08:04.230 --> 00:08:06.910
isn't the belief that everyone's the same,

00:08:06.910 --> 00:08:08.390
or that everyone's equally intelligent,

00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:09.970
or learns the same way.

00:08:09.970 --> 00:08:12.110
Rather, it's a belief that
no matter how smart you are,

00:08:12.110 --> 00:08:15.580
you can always become smarter
by learning from your mistakes

00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:17.960
and challenging yourself to learn more.

00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:18.793
- Very good.

00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:22.633
I guess, this is a
question for Annie and Sam,

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:26.993
why is growth mindset
important for students?

00:08:29.210 --> 00:08:32.280
- I think growth mindset is just

00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:34.490
really essential for students
because so many students

00:08:34.490 --> 00:08:37.790
come to school with us
feeling limitations,

00:08:37.790 --> 00:08:39.680
whether they put them on themselves

00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:43.999
or they've been put on by someone else.

00:08:43.999 --> 00:08:47.290
And I think when students
develop growth mindsets

00:08:47.290 --> 00:08:49.320
they start to understand that

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:51.260
their possibilities are limitless.

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:52.800
That with hard work and effort

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:55.240
they can make great
achievements in school.

00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:59.150
There's a quote in Carol
Dweck's book Mindset.

00:08:59.150 --> 00:09:02.930
That's, a person's true potential
is unknown and unknowable,

00:09:02.930 --> 00:09:05.560
and it's impossible to foresee
what can be accomplished

00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:07.230
with years of passion, toil, and training.

00:09:07.230 --> 00:09:09.540
And that's like my
personal teaching mantra

00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:11.860
because I wanna enter school every day

00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:15.790
and just feel like I'm
not gonna limit any kid.

00:09:15.790 --> 00:09:19.030
Any kid can achieve anything
if they wanna put in the work.

00:09:19.030 --> 00:09:21.520
When you're a student, and
you go into the classroom,

00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:24.180
and you look around, and
there's 20 or 25 other learners,

00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:26.990
it's really easy to get in
that fixed mindset space

00:09:26.990 --> 00:09:29.430
where you're looking
around and contemplating,

00:09:29.430 --> 00:09:31.900
why does this come so quickly to her,

00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:35.053
or why is he so great at
this, and it's so hard for me?

00:09:36.070 --> 00:09:38.520
It's easy to tell yourself the story that,

00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:40.450
oh, they're just blessed
with that ability,

00:09:40.450 --> 00:09:43.850
or oh, they just have some natural talent

00:09:43.850 --> 00:09:48.020
or natural affinity for math,
or art, or music, or whatever.

00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:51.250
It's hard to reckon with the truth

00:09:51.250 --> 00:09:54.280
that effort is what leads to achievement.

00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:56.670
But we have to care
about our students enough

00:09:56.670 --> 00:09:59.270
not to let them get away
with the easy thing,

00:09:59.270 --> 00:10:02.530
which is just to believe that
they're not cut out for it.

00:10:02.530 --> 00:10:05.530
I just think it's so important
to bring growth mindset

00:10:05.530 --> 00:10:08.770
into our schools and into our classrooms

00:10:08.770 --> 00:10:13.770
because when we give kids the tools,

00:10:14.530 --> 00:10:15.960
the language of growth mindset,

00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:19.660
the tools to use growth
mindset in their learning,

00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:22.560
they learn how to put
in effort, to push hard,

00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:25.230
to fight, to achieve goals,

00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:27.180
and the kids who are achieving goals

00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:29.390
will turn into adults who achieve goals,

00:10:29.390 --> 00:10:32.050
and we need adults who are tenacious

00:10:32.050 --> 00:10:34.793
and willing to solve difficult problems.

00:10:35.910 --> 00:10:37.250
That starts in our classrooms.

00:10:37.250 --> 00:10:38.083
- Yeah.

00:10:38.083 --> 00:10:39.640
- I think the great thing
about growth mindset

00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:42.063
is it gives every single child hope.

00:10:43.010 --> 00:10:45.820
It's no longer this mindset of okay,

00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:47.150
those are the kids who are smart,

00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:49.040
and I'm never gonna be one of them.

00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:51.670
Everyone is on a journey,
everyone can learn.

00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:53.010
And Annie kinda touched on this,

00:10:53.010 --> 00:10:56.060
at the beginning of the year I
describe knowledge to my kids

00:10:56.060 --> 00:10:58.460
as a sphere to help 'em visualize it.

00:10:58.460 --> 00:11:00.710
And there's an infinite number
of doors on this sphere,

00:11:00.710 --> 00:11:03.670
and we've all got these keys,
and it can be so frustrating

00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:05.750
to look over and watch your
friend put their key in,

00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:07.630
and turn and the door opens,

00:11:07.630 --> 00:11:10.560
yet when you put your
key in, it doesn't work.

00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:12.070
That's not where we stop, though.

00:11:12.070 --> 00:11:13.830
That's where you get with your teacher

00:11:13.830 --> 00:11:15.170
and we are gonna figure this out.

00:11:15.170 --> 00:11:16.820
We're gonna figure out how our brain works

00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:19.550
and we're gonna keep going
because you deserve that moment

00:11:19.550 --> 00:11:22.410
where you put your key in, and
all your effort has paid off,

00:11:22.410 --> 00:11:24.830
and that door finally turns.

00:11:24.830 --> 00:11:26.990
And the great thing about
the growth mindset is

00:11:26.990 --> 00:11:30.590
embedded within it is goal
setting, it's reflection,

00:11:30.590 --> 00:11:32.930
and we're truly empowering our kids

00:11:32.930 --> 00:11:36.060
to be life-long learners, not
just fourth-grade learners.

00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:36.990
- Right.

00:11:36.990 --> 00:11:40.160
So, I guess for Annie and for Dave,

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:42.810
there's so much out there
about growth mindset.

00:11:42.810 --> 00:11:45.900
What is important for
teachers to focus in on

00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:48.420
when fostering a growth
mindset for students?

00:11:48.420 --> 00:11:49.940
- Yeah, so I think a really great place

00:11:49.940 --> 00:11:52.210
to start is by laying that foundation.

00:11:52.210 --> 00:11:53.613
By helping them really understand

00:11:53.613 --> 00:11:55.220
that the brain is malleable.

00:11:55.220 --> 00:11:56.580
Really helping them understand

00:11:56.580 --> 00:11:59.150
the neuroscience behind growth mindset.

00:11:59.150 --> 00:12:01.560
So again, I think that's
really just the foundation.

00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:02.720
So, that's a great place to start,

00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:05.120
and I think the LearnStorm
growth mindset activities

00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:08.460
really do a good job of
laying that foundation.

00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:09.860
But then I think it's really important

00:12:09.860 --> 00:12:11.590
to go deeper than that, too,

00:12:11.590 --> 00:12:14.450
and I think what teachers
can do to do that is

00:12:14.450 --> 00:12:16.330
to create this growth mindset culture,

00:12:16.330 --> 00:12:19.080
which is characterized by
being really a safe place

00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:21.770
for students to feel like
they can make mistakes,

00:12:21.770 --> 00:12:23.640
and where they can challenge themselves

00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:26.160
without worrying about how
their teacher will see them

00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:28.380
or how their peers will see them.

00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:31.180
It's a place where they'll feel like

00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:32.990
their mistakes will be celebrated,

00:12:32.990 --> 00:12:34.440
as long as they're learning from them,

00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:38.120
and where growth is
prioritized over proficiency.

00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:40.090
And I think what teachers can do

00:12:40.090 --> 00:12:42.210
is they can really make it
obvious that in their class

00:12:42.210 --> 00:12:44.820
the thing that matters most
is how much they're learning,

00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:48.130
and that their relationship
with their students

00:12:48.130 --> 00:12:51.880
isn't one of judge, but
rather one of coach.

00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:55.280
So, a lot of the time students
worry that their teacher,

00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:56.810
they really see their teacher as a judge,

00:12:56.810 --> 00:12:58.360
someone who's there to evaluate

00:12:58.360 --> 00:12:59.553
whether they're a good
learner or a bad learner,

00:12:59.553 --> 00:13:01.463
whether they're smart or dumb,

00:13:02.340 --> 00:13:05.200
but when they see their
teachers as a judge in that way,

00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:06.550
it can really get in the way of learning

00:13:06.550 --> 00:13:08.880
because it's very hard to be vulnerable

00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:11.050
if you're really worried about

00:13:11.050 --> 00:13:14.070
how the person will see
you, and to ask for help.

00:13:14.070 --> 00:13:16.870
But in contrast, if a
teacher really creates

00:13:16.870 --> 00:13:18.050
this kind of growth mindset culture,

00:13:18.050 --> 00:13:19.630
and really talks to their students,

00:13:19.630 --> 00:13:23.710
and helps them see them as their coach,

00:13:23.710 --> 00:13:26.210
as someone who's really there
to bring out the best in them

00:13:26.210 --> 00:13:28.170
and help them grow the most,

00:13:28.170 --> 00:13:30.070
then that really changes
the way students feel about

00:13:30.070 --> 00:13:31.570
challenging themselves,
and helps them feel

00:13:31.570 --> 00:13:33.930
much more confident and comfortable.

00:13:33.930 --> 00:13:35.340
Really putting themselves out there

00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:36.680
and challenging themselves.

00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:37.920
- I love that.

00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:40.090
- Yeah, I agree with everything Dave said,

00:13:40.090 --> 00:13:42.240
and I would also, number one,

00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:46.250
is just teaching kids
what the mindsets are.

00:13:46.250 --> 00:13:48.410
Giving them the
understanding of how learning

00:13:48.410 --> 00:13:50.860
actually happens in their bodies.

00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:54.210
How their brains work,
what equipment we all have.

00:13:54.210 --> 00:13:57.640
That process of creating connections

00:13:57.640 --> 00:13:59.290
in our brain is the same for everyone.

00:13:59.290 --> 00:14:01.850
So, just giving them
that knowledge is key.

00:14:01.850 --> 00:14:05.030
And then secondly, giving
them challenging work,

00:14:05.030 --> 00:14:06.970
and that's gonna look
differently for every kid.

00:14:06.970 --> 00:14:09.150
Challenging, there's many definitions

00:14:09.150 --> 00:14:11.430
in a classroom of what
challenging work is,

00:14:11.430 --> 00:14:14.550
but giving them challenging
work and then supporting them

00:14:14.550 --> 00:14:18.330
as they meet the high expectations
that you've set for them,

00:14:18.330 --> 00:14:20.720
in doing that, you're creating
a growth mindset culture

00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:22.980
because truly, if the work is easy,

00:14:22.980 --> 00:14:24.360
the mindset is irrelevant.

00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:26.803
if kids are just breezing through things.

00:14:30.150 --> 00:14:31.710
To me, a growth mindset classroom

00:14:31.710 --> 00:14:34.540
looks like lots of chances
on your path to mastery.

00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:36.490
Lots of chances to get it right.

00:14:36.490 --> 00:14:38.470
A teacher who's modeling growth mindset,

00:14:38.470 --> 00:14:40.660
so talking through the process,

00:14:40.660 --> 00:14:42.200
talking through your struggles,

00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:44.840
and valuing growth over perfection.

00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:47.880
And I love how you talked
about normalizing mistakes,

00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:51.410
or looking at mistakes as
an opportunity to learn.

00:14:51.410 --> 00:14:53.100
I have a funny story.

00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:55.530
I was chatting with some
Khan Academy ambassadors,

00:14:55.530 --> 00:14:58.020
and a teacher said that she had taught

00:14:58.020 --> 00:15:00.280
her second grade class about
what growth mindset was,

00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:04.220
and they're working towards
looking at mistakes and failure

00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:06.210
as just a part of learning.

00:15:06.210 --> 00:15:08.850
You teach these things, and
you tell the kids these things,

00:15:08.850 --> 00:15:10.960
and you're not sure if it's resonating

00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:14.010
until it comes back to you in some form.

00:15:14.010 --> 00:15:16.151
She said one kiddo who started the year

00:15:16.151 --> 00:15:17.370
with a little bit of a fixed mindset

00:15:17.370 --> 00:15:20.200
came in with some homemade signs that said

00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:22.180
this is a mistake making place,

00:15:22.180 --> 00:15:25.100
but making was spelled M-A-K-E-I-N-G.

00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:25.933
- Oh.

00:15:25.933 --> 00:15:27.120
- I know, that is such a good story.

00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:28.810
I'm like, that's such a great example

00:15:28.810 --> 00:15:30.510
of what growth mindset looks like.

00:15:30.510 --> 00:15:32.340
It is trying, it's putting
yourself out there,

00:15:32.340 --> 00:15:35.330
it's being vulnerable and I can't imagine

00:15:35.330 --> 00:15:37.520
what kind of amazing
classroom that teacher has

00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:40.840
where a kid internalizes that,

00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:42.503
and then is willing to just show up

00:15:42.503 --> 00:15:44.270
and put himself out there.

00:15:44.270 --> 00:15:48.520
So, you can foster growth
mindset in your classroom

00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:51.910
in a bunch of different
ways, but to me it looks like

00:15:51.910 --> 00:15:53.560
what is growth mindset?

00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:56.170
Giving challenging work,
setting high expectations,

00:15:56.170 --> 00:15:57.940
and then being that support structure

00:15:57.940 --> 00:15:59.930
for the kids to achieve their goals.

00:15:59.930 --> 00:16:00.763
- Right. Well, thank you.

00:16:00.763 --> 00:16:02.040
Thank you for sharing that story.

00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:03.820
That sounds like a really amazing way

00:16:03.820 --> 00:16:06.450
to foster learning in sort
of the best environment

00:16:06.450 --> 00:16:09.950
that we want for all of our
students, which is so great.

00:16:09.950 --> 00:16:13.130
Dave, I know that Khan
Academy worked with you a lot

00:16:13.130 --> 00:16:15.630
on these growth mindset activities.

00:16:15.630 --> 00:16:17.120
Can you give me some of the highlights

00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:18.750
of the curriculum?

00:16:18.750 --> 00:16:21.040
- Yeah, so it was really fun first of all

00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:22.990
working on that curriculum
with the Khan Academy team,

00:16:22.990 --> 00:16:24.033
I always enjoy that.

00:16:25.630 --> 00:16:27.270
I think one thing I
really appreciate about it

00:16:27.270 --> 00:16:29.100
is that it really, I
think, does a good job

00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:32.268
of hitting a lot of the main
themes that are important

00:16:32.268 --> 00:16:34.120
for laying that foundation
for a growth mindset,

00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:37.250
and it does it in a really
fun and engaging way,

00:16:37.250 --> 00:16:39.300
in no small part thanks to Thinky Pinky,

00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:43.750
who's a great character to have
accompany you on this ride.

00:16:43.750 --> 00:16:46.240
But yeah, it really hits at
some of the scientific evidence

00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:47.627
behind the growth mindset,

00:16:47.627 --> 00:16:49.550
and it really helps students understand

00:16:49.550 --> 00:16:51.250
how powerful mistakes can be.

00:16:51.250 --> 00:16:53.570
How they can really be allies
on this learning journey,

00:16:53.570 --> 00:16:55.490
if you take time to
really reflect on them,

00:16:55.490 --> 00:16:57.520
and really understand what that means,

00:16:57.520 --> 00:16:59.230
what opportunities you
have to learn better

00:16:59.230 --> 00:17:01.503
and to better develop.

00:17:01.503 --> 00:17:04.670
It also helps students
set ambitious goals,

00:17:04.670 --> 00:17:07.903
because if you're not
really challenging yourself

00:17:07.903 --> 00:17:09.880
then it doesn't matter if
you have a growth mindset.

00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:11.760
If you're just thinking,
boy, I sure could grow,

00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:14.080
but if you're not doing things

00:17:14.080 --> 00:17:16.390
that actually challenge
you to grow, you won't.

00:17:16.390 --> 00:17:18.930
So, I think it helps
students set those goals,

00:17:18.930 --> 00:17:22.110
and really understand why
doing that is important.

00:17:22.110 --> 00:17:23.950
And then I think last, but not least,

00:17:23.950 --> 00:17:26.160
and also when you're really doing that,

00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:27.600
when you're going for
those ambitious goals

00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:29.680
and pushing yourself,
you're gonna struggle,

00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:32.450
and you're going to get
frustrated sometimes.

00:17:32.450 --> 00:17:34.010
And there's also really good advice there

00:17:34.010 --> 00:17:36.020
for students and for teachers
around how to deal with

00:17:36.020 --> 00:17:38.060
those inevitable struggles that come up

00:17:38.060 --> 00:17:39.480
when you're really pushing yourself.

00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:40.613
- Right. Exactly.

00:17:42.471 --> 00:17:45.230
I guess, Sam, just for those
teachers who are watching

00:17:45.230 --> 00:17:47.970
who are like, I need some
practical applications

00:17:47.970 --> 00:17:50.300
of how to do this, and
what's happening now,

00:17:50.300 --> 00:17:53.650
you've participated in LearnStorm
for a couple years now.

00:17:53.650 --> 00:17:56.290
What are you looking
forward to for LearnStorm

00:17:56.290 --> 00:17:59.440
and the growth mindset
activities for this year?

00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:02.550
- Well, I really like that
there's been a bit of a shift

00:18:02.550 --> 00:18:04.860
in the LearnStorm in
that now they are aligned

00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:06.280
to elementary, middle
school, and high school,

00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:08.870
and I think that helps
a tremendous amount.

00:18:08.870 --> 00:18:11.680
We spend so much time at
the beginning of the year

00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:13.920
doing these direct lessons
where we're talking about

00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:16.050
what's actually happening in your brain,

00:18:16.050 --> 00:18:19.760
and what's happening in your
body when you become stressed,

00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:22.610
and dealing with the
frustrations and everything.

00:18:22.610 --> 00:18:23.890
We do all these different activities,

00:18:23.890 --> 00:18:26.590
and then just at the perfect
time LearnStorm comes in,

00:18:26.590 --> 00:18:30.020
and the kids get to hear that
information in a different way

00:18:30.020 --> 00:18:32.020
and interact with it in a different way.

00:18:34.828 --> 00:18:37.120
Although the growth mindset videos

00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:40.150
and articles are phenomenal,
for me personally,

00:18:40.150 --> 00:18:41.170
the best part about LearnStorm

00:18:41.170 --> 00:18:43.140
is what happens right after that,

00:18:43.140 --> 00:18:45.010
when the application piece comes in.

00:18:45.010 --> 00:18:47.620
When we're doing math,
or coding, or grammar,

00:18:47.620 --> 00:18:48.710
or whatever we're working on,

00:18:48.710 --> 00:18:51.020
and they go to do their assignments,

00:18:51.020 --> 00:18:54.650
and there's such a
presence of class synergy.

00:18:54.650 --> 00:18:56.820
Because if you wanna see my class

00:18:56.820 --> 00:19:00.930
suddenly get silent and excited,
my class manager, Maddy,

00:19:00.930 --> 00:19:02.810
she'll go up to the
board and they watch her

00:19:02.810 --> 00:19:04.130
like on pins and needles 'cause they know

00:19:04.130 --> 00:19:06.793
she's getting ready to
push a check progress.

00:19:08.430 --> 00:19:11.090
They want those rings to fill so badly,

00:19:11.090 --> 00:19:13.100
and they know that
every single one of them

00:19:13.100 --> 00:19:14.823
contributed to that happening.

00:19:18.140 --> 00:19:20.080
I love, though, that Dave mentioned

00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:21.703
dealing with the frustrations.

00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:25.410
I had a student who just, she was like,

00:19:25.410 --> 00:19:27.780
just tell me how to do this one.

00:19:27.780 --> 00:19:29.753
She didn't want to do it on her own.

00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:32.840
They know that I won't do that.

00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:35.570
I'm here for you, let's talk through it.

00:19:35.570 --> 00:19:36.403
Don't tell me what you don't know,

00:19:36.403 --> 00:19:38.680
tell me what you do know,
and working through it,

00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:41.830
and she left that day totally frustrated,

00:19:41.830 --> 00:19:42.750
and came back the next day,

00:19:42.750 --> 00:19:43.930
could not wait to grab her Chromebook.

00:19:43.930 --> 00:19:45.470
Ran over, said she'd figured it out,

00:19:45.470 --> 00:19:47.363
popped it in, and it was correct.

00:19:48.570 --> 00:19:50.910
She was the class hero in that moment.

00:19:50.910 --> 00:19:52.520
I asked her, I said, how
do you feel right now?

00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:53.870
She's like, oh, I feel so good.

00:19:53.870 --> 00:19:54.730
I did this.

00:19:54.730 --> 00:19:57.890
I said, you wouldn't have felt like that

00:19:57.890 --> 00:19:59.447
if I'd just told you the answer.

00:19:59.447 --> 00:20:02.210
And so taking those little moments

00:20:02.210 --> 00:20:05.210
to let your kids feel
that intrinsic motivation,

00:20:05.210 --> 00:20:07.580
I think is really, really
powerful in the classroom,

00:20:07.580 --> 00:20:09.540
and LearnStorm kind of gives us that

00:20:09.540 --> 00:20:12.540
framework at the beginning
to really help establish that

00:20:12.540 --> 00:20:14.250
that's what this is
like in this classroom.

00:20:14.250 --> 00:20:15.470
- Right, that's amazing.

00:20:15.470 --> 00:20:18.690
And can I just ask as like
an aside, as a teacher,

00:20:18.690 --> 00:20:20.980
what is that moment like
for you to experience?

00:20:20.980 --> 00:20:23.730
To see your students kind of
learn and experience that.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:25.833
- There's a gamut of emotions

00:20:25.833 --> 00:20:28.110
when you watch your kiddos learn

00:20:28.110 --> 00:20:30.648
because you feel
frustrations along with them,

00:20:30.648 --> 00:20:33.313
and you feel the discouragement, too.

00:20:34.150 --> 00:20:36.190
I have a young man who really has,

00:20:36.190 --> 00:20:38.530
he has a lot of intense emotions

00:20:38.530 --> 00:20:41.610
that he's learning to deal
with, as a lot of our kids do.

00:20:41.610 --> 00:20:44.700
He was so frustrated
because on an assignment

00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:47.810
that we had did, he got one out of seven,

00:20:47.810 --> 00:20:50.760
and he was just so down.

00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:53.720
I was like, buddy, your
neurons found a path.

00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:55.820
You got one, you know?

00:20:55.820 --> 00:20:57.260
He was like, what?

00:20:57.260 --> 00:20:59.210
Not very impressed with that response.

00:20:59.210 --> 00:21:00.070
And I said, you know what?

00:21:00.070 --> 00:21:00.903
We're gonna do this again.

00:21:00.903 --> 00:21:02.270
I wanna see if you're neurons can find

00:21:02.270 --> 00:21:05.610
another path and get
two, and he got three.

00:21:05.610 --> 00:21:06.539
And then he said, go away.

00:21:06.539 --> 00:21:07.372
(laughing)

00:21:07.372 --> 00:21:09.020
Alright, so I went to help other kiddos,

00:21:09.020 --> 00:21:10.950
and a little bit later he came to me,

00:21:10.950 --> 00:21:12.830
and he said, I need
you to close your eyes.

00:21:12.830 --> 00:21:14.570
Then he led me back to his computer,

00:21:14.570 --> 00:21:16.690
and I open my eyes, and he had
tears running down his face,

00:21:16.690 --> 00:21:18.000
and it said seven out of seven.

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:18.833
- [Rachel] Aw.

00:21:18.833 --> 00:21:20.760
- And in that moment, like
that's why we're teachers,

00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:21.941
and that's why we do what we do,

00:21:21.941 --> 00:21:23.441
and that's what we strive for.

00:21:24.690 --> 00:21:28.070
For him to feel that moment,
and know he did it on his own,

00:21:28.070 --> 00:21:32.100
and he gave his brain the time to learn

00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:35.529
and allow his neurons
to find those pathways.

00:21:35.529 --> 00:21:38.420
And the other kids see that, too,

00:21:38.420 --> 00:21:40.120
and it empowers them as much.

00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:41.120
Like, I can do this, too.

00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:42.429
Go away, go away. I got it.

00:21:42.429 --> 00:21:43.770
(laughing)

00:21:43.770 --> 00:21:45.530
So, there's a litany of emotions

00:21:45.530 --> 00:21:47.060
you feel as a teacher, as well.

00:21:47.060 --> 00:21:48.690
You feel the frustrations with them.

00:21:48.690 --> 00:21:52.220
There's nothing better than
the kid, that they've got it.

00:21:52.220 --> 00:21:53.053
- I love that.

00:21:53.053 --> 00:21:54.870
It definitely seems, just
from hearing you all talk,

00:21:54.870 --> 00:21:56.460
and then kind of our
earlier conversations,

00:21:56.460 --> 00:21:58.940
that there's definitely
a certain sort of bravery

00:21:58.940 --> 00:22:00.960
that has to happen on both
the side of the teacher

00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:03.270
and the student when participating in

00:22:03.270 --> 00:22:04.740
these growth mindset activities, right?

00:22:04.740 --> 00:22:06.990
You have to trust that
your students can do this,

00:22:06.990 --> 00:22:08.850
and that they can learn,
and that it's okay

00:22:08.850 --> 00:22:10.440
to watch them struggle a little bit.

00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:12.390
And then on the other
end, for these students,

00:22:12.390 --> 00:22:13.980
it's okay for them to struggle,

00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:14.813
and to work through things,

00:22:14.813 --> 00:22:17.210
and I think that's such
a beautiful lesson.

00:22:17.210 --> 00:22:19.160
Not just in class, but just in general.

00:22:20.190 --> 00:22:23.260
So, this question we
have from Helen in Utah,

00:22:23.260 --> 00:22:26.800
and I will throw this question
to Sam, and perhaps everyone.

00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:28.840
With the demands on the time of day,

00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:31.690
where do you fit in a
growth mindset activities,

00:22:31.690 --> 00:22:34.010
and what is your favorite activity?

00:22:34.010 --> 00:22:35.640
- So, at the beginning of the year

00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:38.083
you do have to make time
to do direct lessons.

00:22:39.706 --> 00:22:41.820
15, 25 minutes a day.

00:22:41.820 --> 00:22:46.820
It can involve a mentor text
such a Ish, or Beautiful Oops,

00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:50.570
or The Great Mistake, any of those.

00:22:50.570 --> 00:22:53.430
Or it can be, my kids really like,

00:22:53.430 --> 00:22:55.870
I actually will show them scans of brains

00:22:55.870 --> 00:22:57.160
and we will talk about what's happening.

00:22:57.160 --> 00:22:58.330
They learn about the neurons.

00:22:58.330 --> 00:23:00.230
They learn about the parts of the brain

00:23:00.230 --> 00:23:01.870
and what they're responsible for.

00:23:01.870 --> 00:23:04.050
And it's a really powerful moment for them

00:23:04.050 --> 00:23:05.190
because a lot of kids come

00:23:05.190 --> 00:23:06.720
and they villainize themselves.

00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:08.270
I'm not smart.

00:23:08.270 --> 00:23:09.710
Whereas this give them, okay,

00:23:09.710 --> 00:23:11.330
no this is what's happening in my brain,

00:23:11.330 --> 00:23:13.530
and I can grow from this.

00:23:13.530 --> 00:23:15.300
And so, we start with that platform,

00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:17.240
and that does take direct instruction time

00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:18.660
at the very beginning of the school year.

00:23:18.660 --> 00:23:20.890
Probably a couple weeks.

00:23:20.890 --> 00:23:24.100
And we try to do a lot of
activities along with them.

00:23:24.100 --> 00:23:26.750
We will read Ish and
then paint on a canvas.

00:23:26.750 --> 00:23:29.070
We make calm down jars

00:23:29.070 --> 00:23:31.590
where the kids will put
glitter and beads in a jar,

00:23:31.590 --> 00:23:33.840
and their favorite food coloring,

00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:36.180
and talk about calming our brain.

00:23:36.180 --> 00:23:38.600
We talk about how our
body releases stress,

00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:41.350
cortisol when they're
stressed, and we can't think.

00:23:41.350 --> 00:23:44.567
And so, we do a lot of these
activities at the beginning,

00:23:44.567 --> 00:23:46.170
and really devote the time to it,

00:23:46.170 --> 00:23:48.510
and I know we don't have
a lot of time as teachers,

00:23:48.510 --> 00:23:50.940
but the payoff is tenfold.

00:23:50.940 --> 00:23:53.680
From there it really is about embedding it

00:23:53.680 --> 00:23:55.370
into just how you speak to your kids

00:23:55.370 --> 00:23:57.020
and how you ask them to
speak not only to you,

00:23:57.020 --> 00:23:58.633
but mostly to themselves.

00:23:59.860 --> 00:24:02.090
My students have on their desk

00:24:02.090 --> 00:24:03.870
a picture of themselves holding

00:24:03.870 --> 00:24:06.330
a sign they created that says yet.

00:24:06.330 --> 00:24:08.290
At the beginning, I gotta
point to that picture a lot

00:24:08.290 --> 00:24:10.638
because they self-doubt, and they

00:24:10.638 --> 00:24:12.883
talk so negatively to themselves.

00:24:12.883 --> 00:24:14.530
And so, I can't do this,
and I'll point to it,

00:24:14.530 --> 00:24:16.970
and say, I can't do it yet.

00:24:16.970 --> 00:24:19.060
And then we work really hard to say,

00:24:19.060 --> 00:24:21.710
okay, we can sit here
all day talking about

00:24:21.710 --> 00:24:23.070
the things we don't know.

00:24:23.070 --> 00:24:25.433
Let's start on this
problem, what do you know?

00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:28.770
And it's more, it's not about something

00:24:28.770 --> 00:24:30.130
you do separate from that point,

00:24:30.130 --> 00:24:31.897
it's how you empower your students,

00:24:31.897 --> 00:24:33.340
and how you talk to them,

00:24:33.340 --> 00:24:36.690
and how you expect them
to talk to themselves.

00:24:36.690 --> 00:24:37.893
That's really...

00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:41.800
The rest of the year, it's
not something extra anymore.

00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:43.890
It's just the environment
in your classroom,

00:24:43.890 --> 00:24:45.920
your vocabulary, their vocabulary.

00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:48.070
And I tell 'em, I will never let anybody

00:24:48.070 --> 00:24:49.770
be mean to you, especially yourself.

00:24:49.770 --> 00:24:52.193
And I think a lot of kiddos,

00:24:53.450 --> 00:24:55.030
they're the meanest to themselves.

00:24:55.030 --> 00:24:55.863
- Right.

00:24:56.900 --> 00:24:59.550
- I agree with everything that Sam said.

00:24:59.550 --> 00:25:03.020
I think in terms of concrete
activities that you can do,

00:25:03.020 --> 00:25:05.720
definitely direct instruction for teaching

00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:08.910
what is growth mindset, and giving them

00:25:08.910 --> 00:25:11.050
that vocabulary, those tools.

00:25:11.050 --> 00:25:12.790
Understanding how their brains work,

00:25:12.790 --> 00:25:14.930
that requires some direct
instruction upfront,

00:25:14.930 --> 00:25:16.500
but totally agree that if you do that

00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:18.130
little front loading piece,

00:25:18.130 --> 00:25:20.320
and then you work really hard to embed

00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:21.670
growth mindset into your culture.

00:25:21.670 --> 00:25:25.190
It's not necessarily a kind
of activity but it's...

00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:30.310
For me, I think any type
of lesson or activity

00:25:30.310 --> 00:25:33.320
that requires iterative
thinking, or trial and error

00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:36.920
is going to allow them to
experience a little struggle,

00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:39.880
experience testing something,
it works, it doesn't work,

00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:41.840
and going back to the drawing board.

00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:43.810
Any type of collaborative activities

00:25:43.810 --> 00:25:47.023
are really great for
working with one another.

00:25:47.910 --> 00:25:49.070
Project-based learning.

00:25:49.070 --> 00:25:51.810
Where there's not
necessarily a right answer,

00:25:51.810 --> 00:25:53.810
and just coming up with solutions.

00:25:53.810 --> 00:25:56.870
The breakouts I think are really great,

00:25:56.870 --> 00:25:58.480
or any opportunity for the kids

00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:00.080
to have some productive struggle

00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:01.730
when you create a challenge that

00:26:01.730 --> 00:26:03.870
may be a little just
beyond their capabilities,

00:26:03.870 --> 00:26:06.380
and let them grapple
with that a little bit.

00:26:06.380 --> 00:26:08.120
Those are all good opportunities,

00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:11.220
but they should just be things
that we're doing every day

00:26:11.220 --> 00:26:12.310
that there's always chances,

00:26:12.310 --> 00:26:14.270
and I always think that
the important piece

00:26:14.270 --> 00:26:16.890
is that we debrief
afterwards, and we talk about

00:26:16.890 --> 00:26:18.230
what was your learning like?

00:26:18.230 --> 00:26:19.570
What did it feel like?

00:26:19.570 --> 00:26:22.330
How did you push through
the difficult parts?

00:26:22.330 --> 00:26:26.400
I think, as a learner, in my
experience as a learner anyway,

00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:28.040
those most difficult experiences

00:26:28.040 --> 00:26:29.720
are the most memorable experiences.

00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:32.170
They're the ones that I
walk away like, I did it!

00:26:33.130 --> 00:26:34.980
I got through that even if it ended up

00:26:34.980 --> 00:26:37.790
being a C in algebra, to me,

00:26:37.790 --> 00:26:40.350
when it felt like there was no hope,

00:26:40.350 --> 00:26:44.160
walking out of there, and
knowing that I had gotten it,

00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:47.590
or had grown, that's a
really rewarding experience.

00:26:47.590 --> 00:26:50.380
So, just embedding it in the
culture of your classroom

00:26:50.380 --> 00:26:52.500
and in everything you do is so important.

00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:54.040
- Right.

00:26:54.040 --> 00:26:55.090
Dave, anything to add?

00:26:55.090 --> 00:26:55.923
- No, I think that's great.

00:26:55.923 --> 00:26:56.796
- Okay. Sure.

00:26:56.796 --> 00:26:58.350
I was gonna say one of
my favorite things about

00:26:58.350 --> 00:27:00.470
what you both said is just the idea that

00:27:00.470 --> 00:27:02.690
we can kind of have this
generation of students

00:27:02.690 --> 00:27:06.300
who don't have to unlearn
these bad mentalities

00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:08.350
about themselves, and internalize that.

00:27:08.350 --> 00:27:10.810
What kind of young people
can we unleash on the world

00:27:10.810 --> 00:27:12.690
if they were just super positive about

00:27:12.690 --> 00:27:13.670
what they could accomplish?

00:27:13.670 --> 00:27:15.510
It's so amazing. I love it.

00:27:15.510 --> 00:27:18.210
Alright, Scarlett from Georgia asked,

00:27:18.210 --> 00:27:20.120
what is the best way to get students

00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:21.930
excited about growth mindset?

00:27:21.930 --> 00:27:24.143
I will throw this one to Annie and Sam.

00:27:26.070 --> 00:27:29.910
- I think to get kids
excited is number one,

00:27:29.910 --> 00:27:33.250
just I think Sam was saying earlier,

00:27:33.250 --> 00:27:34.740
I'm gonna steal what
we were talking about,

00:27:34.740 --> 00:27:37.040
but Sam was saying earlier
that kids come to you

00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:40.960
already feeling excited
about their potential.

00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:43.290
Or if they come to you feeling
down about their potential,

00:27:43.290 --> 00:27:44.700
if you could teach them about

00:27:44.700 --> 00:27:49.010
how their brains work, and
how with effort and hard work

00:27:49.010 --> 00:27:50.450
they can make accomplishments

00:27:50.450 --> 00:27:52.670
and make gains in their learning,

00:27:52.670 --> 00:27:55.360
that gets them excited,
especially when they see progress.

00:27:55.360 --> 00:28:00.360
It doesn't necessarily
have to be like a party

00:28:00.530 --> 00:28:02.133
to get excited about it.

00:28:03.630 --> 00:28:06.730
I think we all are excited
about our own potential.

00:28:06.730 --> 00:28:10.370
And when you bring that
passion into the classroom

00:28:10.370 --> 00:28:12.760
and you're developing
relationships with the kids,

00:28:12.760 --> 00:28:15.290
and growing those bonds,
and showing them that

00:28:15.290 --> 00:28:18.340
you believe in their capabilities,

00:28:18.340 --> 00:28:20.900
teaching them how to believe in themselves

00:28:20.900 --> 00:28:24.680
and how to reframe and refocus,
how to be mindful about

00:28:24.680 --> 00:28:26.710
how they learn best and
apply those strategies,

00:28:26.710 --> 00:28:28.830
and give them opportunities to struggle

00:28:28.830 --> 00:28:32.420
and come out on top, I
think kids get excited about

00:28:32.420 --> 00:28:36.180
learning and about their own
possibilities and capabilities.

00:28:36.180 --> 00:28:37.013
- Yeah, I think so.

00:28:37.013 --> 00:28:41.250
And as adults sometimes,
we haven't put ourselves

00:28:41.250 --> 00:28:45.363
in situations in a while often
that kids are in every day.

00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:48.540
Where we are struggling,
and we don't get something,

00:28:48.540 --> 00:28:50.740
and we want to get it.

00:28:50.740 --> 00:28:51.903
If you've forgotten what that feels like,

00:28:51.903 --> 00:28:54.030
then I encourage you to go take a class,

00:28:54.030 --> 00:28:56.690
or do something outside the normal

00:28:56.690 --> 00:28:58.890
because there's not a
worse feeling in the world

00:28:58.890 --> 00:29:00.480
than seeing everybody else get it,

00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:03.423
and you giving it your
all, but you don't get it.

00:29:04.530 --> 00:29:08.980
And so, growth mindset
empowers kids to know that

00:29:08.980 --> 00:29:12.070
that's not the period, that's
not the end of the story.

00:29:12.070 --> 00:29:13.747
- [Rachel] Right, right, exactly.

00:29:13.747 --> 00:29:15.770
- And that doesn't define me.

00:29:15.770 --> 00:29:18.750
This is a part of my
journey, and watch me go.

00:29:18.750 --> 00:29:19.583
- [Rachel] Right.

00:29:19.583 --> 00:29:20.833
- I think modeling and sharing.

00:29:22.140 --> 00:29:23.850
There's lots of teachers have success

00:29:23.850 --> 00:29:26.643
with sharing stories of famous failures.

00:29:27.550 --> 00:29:29.840
Michael Jordan was cut from his
high school basketball team,

00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:32.000
or Harry Potter was rejected 10 times,

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:34.370
or Abraham Lincoln lost his first bid

00:29:34.370 --> 00:29:36.840
for the Illinois House of Representatives,

00:29:36.840 --> 00:29:38.150
or whatever it is.

00:29:38.150 --> 00:29:40.400
Sharing those stories,
and letting kids know,

00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:45.140
nobody has a seamless
upward trajectory in life.

00:29:45.140 --> 00:29:47.610
We all have this kind of
rocky path that we take.

00:29:47.610 --> 00:29:51.430
There's ups and downs, and
the journey towards success

00:29:51.430 --> 00:29:52.263
requires a lot of that.

00:29:52.263 --> 00:29:53.770
I think that gets them excited, too.

00:29:53.770 --> 00:29:54.770
- [Rachel] Exactly.

00:29:54.770 --> 00:29:56.070
- I think fail with your kids, you know?

00:29:56.070 --> 00:29:58.080
A lot of schools now are
doing failure Fridays,

00:29:58.080 --> 00:29:59.653
and I love failure Fridays.

00:30:00.610 --> 00:30:02.700
The teacher too, we're all learners,

00:30:02.700 --> 00:30:03.533
and we're gonna try something

00:30:03.533 --> 00:30:05.340
completely out of the norm for 15 minutes.

00:30:05.340 --> 00:30:06.440
We're gonna juggle.

00:30:06.440 --> 00:30:07.890
We're going to try to cook something.

00:30:07.890 --> 00:30:08.723
We're going to paint.

00:30:08.723 --> 00:30:12.823
We're gonna try to just do
all sorts of various things

00:30:12.823 --> 00:30:17.050
that might be outside the norm,
and demonstrate to them that

00:30:17.050 --> 00:30:19.223
you can't do it right away
either, and you know what?

00:30:19.223 --> 00:30:21.390
Congratulations, we failed.

00:30:21.390 --> 00:30:22.223
Now what?

00:30:22.223 --> 00:30:23.056
- Right.

00:30:23.056 --> 00:30:23.889
I love that part.

00:30:23.889 --> 00:30:25.170
Like, the now what part?

00:30:25.170 --> 00:30:26.600
That's very, very encouraging.

00:30:26.600 --> 00:30:28.670
I'm gonna remember that when I fail at

00:30:28.670 --> 00:30:30.610
many of the things I try.

00:30:30.610 --> 00:30:31.460
Yes, go ahead.

00:30:31.460 --> 00:30:32.730
- I was just gonna say that
I know that some teachers

00:30:32.730 --> 00:30:35.310
will actually make a point to
intentionally make mistakes

00:30:35.310 --> 00:30:36.650
in front of their students so that

00:30:36.650 --> 00:30:38.290
they can really model for them

00:30:38.290 --> 00:30:39.560
when their students call them out and say,

00:30:39.560 --> 00:30:41.447
hey, that was a mistake,
they can model for them

00:30:41.447 --> 00:30:43.400
the really adaptive response with that.

00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:44.900
Say, oh yeah, you're
right, that was a mistake.

00:30:44.900 --> 00:30:46.650
Help me fix that.

00:30:46.650 --> 00:30:47.840
What did I do wrong?

00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:49.490
And that could really be
this kind of magical time

00:30:49.490 --> 00:30:52.010
when teachers can be
vulnerable for their students

00:30:52.010 --> 00:30:54.580
and really model that it's
okay to make mistakes,

00:30:54.580 --> 00:30:56.980
and that the important
thing is to really learn

00:30:56.980 --> 00:30:58.630
from each other and learn
from those mistakes.

00:30:58.630 --> 00:30:59.463
- Right.

00:30:59.463 --> 00:31:00.370
Yeah, I think that's very true

00:31:00.370 --> 00:31:01.990
'cause I think a lot of teachers feel that

00:31:01.990 --> 00:31:04.550
they have to kind of be kind of perfect,

00:31:04.550 --> 00:31:06.140
and the front of the classroom,

00:31:06.140 --> 00:31:08.380
and they want to project this image.

00:31:08.380 --> 00:31:10.130
I think students learn so much better

00:31:10.130 --> 00:31:11.640
when they have someone to relate to,

00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:13.940
and they're like, oh I see someone that

00:31:13.940 --> 00:31:16.930
I can kind of grow towards,
which is really great.

00:31:16.930 --> 00:31:20.750
I have a question from Sarah
from Bonnie Brae, Virginia.

00:31:20.750 --> 00:31:23.060
Sarah asked, how can I best support

00:31:23.060 --> 00:31:26.580
a learner with disabilities
like ADHD, Asperger's,

00:31:26.580 --> 00:31:28.870
and so on, with concrete examples,

00:31:28.870 --> 00:31:32.070
scaffolding in growth mindset?

00:31:32.070 --> 00:31:33.370
That's a really great question.

00:31:33.370 --> 00:31:35.080
I'm gonna throw it out to the whole panel

00:31:35.080 --> 00:31:36.280
to answer that question.

00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:42.100
- I think any kid can understand

00:31:42.100 --> 00:31:46.330
the basics of how we learn
and what growth mindset is.

00:31:46.330 --> 00:31:50.020
I mean, I've seen as young as preschoolers

00:31:50.020 --> 00:31:52.707
understand that concept
of what growth mindset is,

00:31:52.707 --> 00:31:55.150
and how learning happens in our bodies.

00:31:55.150 --> 00:31:57.080
And once you start with that foundation,

00:31:57.080 --> 00:31:59.510
I think it's just really important to

00:31:59.510 --> 00:32:02.350
let kids know that learning is a journey,

00:32:02.350 --> 00:32:04.770
and the journey is
different for every person.

00:32:04.770 --> 00:32:08.480
Growth mindset is not trying
hard and winning every time.

00:32:08.480 --> 00:32:11.660
People sometimes have that
idea that that's what it is.

00:32:11.660 --> 00:32:16.660
Being successful and getting
success or achievements

00:32:17.850 --> 00:32:20.045
look different for every person.

00:32:20.045 --> 00:32:22.110
I mean, I got an email from a lady

00:32:22.110 --> 00:32:23.810
after I wrote a book on growth mindset,

00:32:23.810 --> 00:32:26.320
and she said, well, I have a friend

00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:29.540
and she struggles with
a learning disability,

00:32:29.540 --> 00:32:32.390
and it took her four times
to pass algebra class,

00:32:32.390 --> 00:32:34.530
and so growth mindset doesn't work.

00:32:34.530 --> 00:32:36.830
I said, well she passed it, you know?

00:32:36.830 --> 00:32:38.238
It just took four times.

00:32:38.238 --> 00:32:39.071
- Right.

00:32:39.071 --> 00:32:40.480
- And really, it's about us changing

00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:42.450
what our definition of success looks like

00:32:42.450 --> 00:32:44.700
because for a lot of teachers

00:32:44.700 --> 00:32:47.320
it's just getting an A+ is success.

00:32:47.320 --> 00:32:51.120
For a lot of parents,
getting an A equals success.

00:32:51.120 --> 00:32:53.070
But we have to look at
it in a different way.

00:32:53.070 --> 00:32:55.620
Sometimes, it's starting with a 32%

00:32:55.620 --> 00:32:57.570
and ending up with a 75%.

00:32:57.570 --> 00:33:00.860
Getting one right, and
then keep working at it

00:33:00.860 --> 00:33:02.540
until you get seven right.

00:33:02.540 --> 00:33:05.619
It's a process, and I think no matter,

00:33:05.619 --> 00:33:07.670
my own son struggles with reading

00:33:07.670 --> 00:33:12.100
and we walk about the way
that you learn reading

00:33:12.100 --> 00:33:13.480
is gonna be different from other people.

00:33:13.480 --> 00:33:15.170
It might take you a
little longer to get it.

00:33:15.170 --> 00:33:17.580
You might have to employ
some different strategies

00:33:17.580 --> 00:33:21.420
that other kids don't have
to do, but you'll get there.

00:33:21.420 --> 00:33:23.880
It's just this is your
road, this is your path,

00:33:23.880 --> 00:33:25.410
and you have to embrace that.

00:33:25.410 --> 00:33:26.310
- Right.

00:33:26.310 --> 00:33:27.779
Dave, anything to add?

00:33:27.779 --> 00:33:29.240
- No, that was great. Yeah.

00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:30.073
- Annie, sorry.

00:33:32.230 --> 00:33:33.388
- I love everything she said.

00:33:33.388 --> 00:33:35.220
(laughing)

00:33:35.220 --> 00:33:37.280
One of my students after a lesson one day,

00:33:37.280 --> 00:33:38.920
made a comment, Daisy.

00:33:38.920 --> 00:33:42.310
She said that even if...

00:33:42.310 --> 00:33:44.340
She redefined the way she
was thinking, and she goes,

00:33:44.340 --> 00:33:47.094
I'm not gonna think about
losing the same way anymore.

00:33:47.094 --> 00:33:47.927
I said, tell me more about that.

00:33:47.927 --> 00:33:48.760
What do you mean?

00:33:48.760 --> 00:33:50.550
She goes, if I lose, but I look at

00:33:50.550 --> 00:33:53.020
why do I think I lost, and what
could I do better next time?

00:33:53.020 --> 00:33:55.174
She goes, I'm gonna start
counting that half winning.

00:33:55.174 --> 00:33:56.410
(laughing)

00:33:56.410 --> 00:33:57.470
I thought that was wonderful.

00:33:57.470 --> 00:33:59.417
In my class, we've kind of adopted that.

00:33:59.417 --> 00:34:03.300
And I love what you said about
we kind of redefine success.

00:34:03.300 --> 00:34:05.400
It may not look like, okay,

00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:08.110
it's 100% on the spelling test every time.

00:34:08.110 --> 00:34:10.270
It's about growth for every child.

00:34:10.270 --> 00:34:11.960
Where are you and where do you want to be?

00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:14.960
It's about putting that goal
setting and that reflection in,

00:34:15.810 --> 00:34:20.100
and every child moving forward, you know?

00:34:20.100 --> 00:34:21.740
No matter where they are.

00:34:21.740 --> 00:34:22.693
- That's fantastic.

00:34:24.420 --> 00:34:29.420
We have a question from Michele
from Juniper, California.

00:34:29.980 --> 00:34:32.610
What is the best way
to get parents on board

00:34:32.610 --> 00:34:34.710
with the idea of growth mindset?

00:34:34.710 --> 00:34:35.830
This is such a really important question

00:34:35.830 --> 00:34:38.550
because I think growth mindset
can look very different

00:34:38.550 --> 00:34:40.500
for many parents who may
not have seen it before,

00:34:40.500 --> 00:34:42.150
and may not have heard it before.

00:34:43.110 --> 00:34:45.133
So, how do you get them on board for this?

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:48.060
- I can start with one thought.

00:34:48.060 --> 00:34:49.348
I think exactly.

00:34:49.348 --> 00:34:50.510
I think for a lot of parents

00:34:50.510 --> 00:34:52.580
it really is very different
than what they're used to,

00:34:52.580 --> 00:34:53.692
and they might not understand,

00:34:53.692 --> 00:34:57.540
is my kid's teacher just
making up all this new stuff?

00:34:57.540 --> 00:34:59.722
'Cause it looks totally
different than what I'm used to.

00:34:59.722 --> 00:35:00.740
And it might be very alien,

00:35:00.740 --> 00:35:02.420
and so I think a good place to start

00:35:02.420 --> 00:35:04.220
might be really with just explaining

00:35:04.220 --> 00:35:05.740
all the research behind growth mindset.

00:35:05.740 --> 00:35:08.620
I mean, not only that this
is true about our brains,

00:35:08.620 --> 00:35:11.560
but also, what an
empowering impact that has

00:35:11.560 --> 00:35:12.560
on a kid's motivation.

00:35:12.560 --> 00:35:16.530
How kids, once they learn to
internalize the growth mindset,

00:35:16.530 --> 00:35:17.970
how they really end up being

00:35:17.970 --> 00:35:19.530
much more likely to challenge themselves,

00:35:19.530 --> 00:35:20.750
to learn from their mistakes,

00:35:20.750 --> 00:35:22.820
to take more challenging classes,

00:35:22.820 --> 00:35:24.243
to do well in class, right?

00:35:25.652 --> 00:35:28.410
So, the end of the day it's really

00:35:28.410 --> 00:35:31.610
an evidence-based approach to
building student's motivation,

00:35:31.610 --> 00:35:33.130
and ultimately, their achievement, too.

00:35:33.130 --> 00:35:35.680
So, I think even parents
who are really sticklers

00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:37.620
for at the end of the day I
want my kid to learn the most,

00:35:37.620 --> 00:35:38.850
well, if that's what you want,

00:35:38.850 --> 00:35:40.660
then this is actually how you get there.

00:35:40.660 --> 00:35:43.703
It's by removing the fear from learning

00:35:43.703 --> 00:35:45.500
that might otherwise constrain them.

00:35:45.500 --> 00:35:48.130
And growth mindset and
growth mindset cultures

00:35:48.130 --> 00:35:49.930
can really just do such a fantastic job

00:35:49.930 --> 00:35:52.300
of helping kids really feel empowered

00:35:52.300 --> 00:35:54.050
and unleashed to learn at their best,

00:35:54.050 --> 00:35:55.705
and to really seem themselves growing,

00:35:55.705 --> 00:35:59.613
rather than being afraid of doing poorly.

00:36:01.092 --> 00:36:02.750
I think that's a great starting point,

00:36:02.750 --> 00:36:04.520
and then I know these two have

00:36:04.520 --> 00:36:07.400
some great follow up suggestion.

00:36:07.400 --> 00:36:09.680
- We have to look at home as an extension

00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:11.790
of the classroom, and vice versa.

00:36:11.790 --> 00:36:16.450
I think just giving parents the tools

00:36:16.450 --> 00:36:18.240
to understand what growth mindset is,

00:36:18.240 --> 00:36:21.220
why we do it, it's an
evidence-based approach,

00:36:21.220 --> 00:36:24.507
and then teaching them
strategies to help them.

00:36:24.507 --> 00:36:26.570
And a lot of times, that comes down to

00:36:26.570 --> 00:36:28.193
just talking to your kids.

00:36:29.540 --> 00:36:32.680
There's kind of the old cliche.

00:36:32.680 --> 00:36:36.260
Like, you ask your kid,
what'd you do today at school?

00:36:36.260 --> 00:36:37.100
Nothing.

00:36:37.100 --> 00:36:37.980
How was it?

00:36:37.980 --> 00:36:38.900
Fine.

00:36:38.900 --> 00:36:40.850
You know, you always hear that.

00:36:40.850 --> 00:36:42.730
But if parents can be intentional about

00:36:42.730 --> 00:36:45.210
how they talk to their kids after school,

00:36:45.210 --> 00:36:48.160
I always ask, my kids and
I, we have a running thing,

00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:51.630
so every day after school, I
say best, worst and weirdest.

00:36:51.630 --> 00:36:52.840
So, they have to tell me my best thing,

00:36:52.840 --> 00:36:54.550
their worst thing, and
their weirdest thing,

00:36:54.550 --> 00:36:57.050
which ends up with a lot of funny stories,

00:36:57.050 --> 00:37:00.260
but it also gives us an
opportunity to kind of dive into,

00:37:00.260 --> 00:37:02.500
okay, so something didn't go very well.

00:37:02.500 --> 00:37:03.413
Why not?

00:37:03.413 --> 00:37:05.520
What was the catalyst
for that not going well?

00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:08.180
Or if something went great,
what kind of strategies

00:37:08.180 --> 00:37:09.890
did you use to pull that off?

00:37:09.890 --> 00:37:11.100
I mean, how did you prepare?

00:37:11.100 --> 00:37:11.990
How did you study?

00:37:11.990 --> 00:37:14.770
How did you handle that tricky situation

00:37:14.770 --> 00:37:16.660
on the playground, or whatever?

00:37:16.660 --> 00:37:18.990
But talking to your kids instead of just,

00:37:18.990 --> 00:37:20.260
good job, A on the test,

00:37:20.260 --> 00:37:22.720
ask them, how did you prepare for this?

00:37:22.720 --> 00:37:24.570
What kind of learning went into this?

00:37:25.630 --> 00:37:27.660
Likewise, if they didn't do so well,

00:37:27.660 --> 00:37:29.873
let's talk about what happened.

00:37:31.200 --> 00:37:36.200
So really helping parents
build that communication

00:37:37.030 --> 00:37:41.700
with their kids about
strategies for learning,

00:37:41.700 --> 00:37:43.880
and what works, and what doesn't,

00:37:43.880 --> 00:37:47.330
and having them draw the link between

00:37:47.330 --> 00:37:49.180
effort and achievement is really important

00:37:49.180 --> 00:37:51.300
so that kids are hearing
it everywhere they go.

00:37:51.300 --> 00:37:52.133
- Very good.

00:37:52.133 --> 00:37:52.966
Best, worst, weirdest.

00:37:52.966 --> 00:37:53.799
I love that.
(laughing)

00:37:53.799 --> 00:37:54.632
Super cool.

00:37:54.632 --> 00:37:55.465
Annie?

00:37:55.465 --> 00:37:56.298
I'm sorry, Sam?

00:37:56.298 --> 00:37:57.160
- That's alright.

00:37:57.160 --> 00:38:00.940
I think the bottom line too,
when it comes to parents is

00:38:00.940 --> 00:38:04.160
they are sending us the most
precious gift they have,

00:38:04.160 --> 00:38:08.850
and there is nothing
worse of a feeling than

00:38:08.850 --> 00:38:11.010
being a parent and seeing your
child struggle in reading,

00:38:11.010 --> 00:38:13.240
or struggle in math,
and you want so badly to

00:38:13.240 --> 00:38:14.890
fix it for them, but you don't know how.

00:38:14.890 --> 00:38:16.670
And so sometimes, when
these parents come to us

00:38:16.670 --> 00:38:19.400
and they're frustrated and
they just want it fixed,

00:38:19.400 --> 00:38:21.200
they're coming from a place of love.

00:38:22.400 --> 00:38:25.700
We have to train them, too,
'cause they'll come upset.

00:38:25.700 --> 00:38:27.620
My child is not a good reader,

00:38:27.620 --> 00:38:28.670
or my child's not good at math.

00:38:28.670 --> 00:38:30.096
Well now, and yet.

00:38:30.096 --> 00:38:30.929
- [Rachel] Right.

00:38:30.929 --> 00:38:32.000
- So, what are we gonna do?

00:38:33.670 --> 00:38:37.690
If you really want to
see the kids just go far,

00:38:37.690 --> 00:38:39.370
a strong partnership between the kiddo,

00:38:39.370 --> 00:38:41.050
the teacher and the parent,

00:38:41.050 --> 00:38:44.620
you've got a big support
system there to really hold up.

00:38:44.620 --> 00:38:45.800
And then it comes down to

00:38:45.800 --> 00:38:48.000
what Annie was talking about earlier.

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:49.770
Alright, we got our
support system holding you.

00:38:49.770 --> 00:38:51.070
Now let's go for some effort.

00:38:51.070 --> 00:38:52.600
- Right, right. Exactly.

00:38:52.600 --> 00:38:55.250
That sounds like a really
strong kind of foundation

00:38:55.250 --> 00:38:56.083
when you have that.

00:38:56.083 --> 00:38:57.800
That sounds beautiful.

00:38:57.800 --> 00:39:00.530
We have a question from Alyssa B.

00:39:00.530 --> 00:39:03.580
How would you recommend
facilitating and encouraging

00:39:03.580 --> 00:39:06.360
other faculty to promote growth mindset?

00:39:06.360 --> 00:39:07.500
So, this is a good question of like,

00:39:07.500 --> 00:39:10.610
what do you do in your
actual school environment?

00:39:10.610 --> 00:39:13.343
- I think being transparent
and being vulnerable.

00:39:14.480 --> 00:39:16.020
Teachers work really hard,

00:39:16.020 --> 00:39:18.220
and we do not have a
lot of time in the day.

00:39:20.980 --> 00:39:23.600
Sometimes it's really easy
to hear something and think,

00:39:23.600 --> 00:39:25.510
that's just another thing.

00:39:25.510 --> 00:39:27.810
So I think by being transparent

00:39:27.810 --> 00:39:29.710
and allowing people to
come into your classroom

00:39:29.710 --> 00:39:33.560
or see the fruits of your kids' labor.

00:39:33.560 --> 00:39:35.950
Let your kids lead things.

00:39:35.950 --> 00:39:39.450
Let your kids be the ones who
go out and talk about things

00:39:39.450 --> 00:39:41.570
because that's where the power lies

00:39:41.570 --> 00:39:42.920
and that's where you show that

00:39:42.920 --> 00:39:44.708
these mountains are being moved.

00:39:44.708 --> 00:39:46.680
And then I think, also, being vulnerable.

00:39:46.680 --> 00:39:48.740
Being able to go to a meeting and say,

00:39:48.740 --> 00:39:50.690
guys, I'm really working
on growth mindset,

00:39:50.690 --> 00:39:53.280
but I really feel like I
personally am failing here.

00:39:53.280 --> 00:39:54.850
I need some help.

00:39:54.850 --> 00:39:57.200
And having those open discussions

00:39:57.200 --> 00:40:00.520
I think encourage more people.

00:40:00.520 --> 00:40:02.260
We talk about our students feeling safe,

00:40:02.260 --> 00:40:04.080
but it's the same thing with the staff.

00:40:04.080 --> 00:40:06.400
The teachers, we've got to feel safe, too,

00:40:06.400 --> 00:40:07.410
to kind of embark on this

00:40:07.410 --> 00:40:09.030
because it's uncomfortable
at the beginning,

00:40:09.030 --> 00:40:11.730
and it's a new way of
thinking, and speaking,

00:40:11.730 --> 00:40:16.420
and there's a big power shift
from the teacher to the kiddos

00:40:16.420 --> 00:40:18.779
and that's nerve-wracking
at the beginning.

00:40:18.779 --> 00:40:20.750
- [Rachel] Right.

00:40:20.750 --> 00:40:23.960
- It's such a positive power shift,

00:40:23.960 --> 00:40:25.280
but scary to take at the beginning.

00:40:25.280 --> 00:40:26.113
- [Rachel] Right.

00:40:26.113 --> 00:40:28.230
- Getting administrators in on it, too.

00:40:28.230 --> 00:40:31.070
I really believe that just
like people approach things

00:40:31.070 --> 00:40:34.520
with a growth and fixed
mindset, that a school has,

00:40:34.520 --> 00:40:37.270
organizations have a
growth or fixed mindset.

00:40:37.270 --> 00:40:39.270
A lot of times, you don't
have to look further than

00:40:39.270 --> 00:40:43.080
the handbook to figure out
what are we valuing here?

00:40:43.080 --> 00:40:44.330
Are we valuing growth?

00:40:44.330 --> 00:40:46.490
Are we valuing perfection?

00:40:46.490 --> 00:40:49.820
So, getting a good gauge on
what is being valued and how,

00:40:49.820 --> 00:40:52.040
are only the kids who are
getting on the A honor role,

00:40:52.040 --> 00:40:53.860
are they the ones that
are being celebrated?

00:40:53.860 --> 00:40:55.640
Do we have ways of celebrating kids

00:40:55.640 --> 00:40:58.223
who are making less,

00:41:00.040 --> 00:41:03.190
or making incremental steps toward growth?

00:41:03.190 --> 00:41:05.330
Do we celebrate that
at all in our culture?

00:41:05.330 --> 00:41:07.760
And so as a teacher, I think
you have the opportunity

00:41:07.760 --> 00:41:09.300
to speak to your admins and say,

00:41:09.300 --> 00:41:12.250
we need to refocus and celebrate.

00:41:12.250 --> 00:41:16.080
Like Dave said, this is
evidence, this is research-based.

00:41:16.080 --> 00:41:19.270
There's a strong body of
research going back, what?

00:41:19.270 --> 00:41:20.426
30 or 40 years.

00:41:20.426 --> 00:41:21.900
- [Dave] Very long time. Yeah.

00:41:21.900 --> 00:41:25.850
- That supports this as a
valuable learning intervention.

00:41:25.850 --> 00:41:29.530
And just sharing that and being

00:41:29.530 --> 00:41:31.850
an advocate for it in
your school, I think,

00:41:31.850 --> 00:41:35.120
is key to changing the
culture of the entire school.

00:41:35.120 --> 00:41:36.380
- Right.

00:41:36.380 --> 00:41:37.213
Very good.

00:41:37.213 --> 00:41:39.130
- Yeah, the only thing
I would add is just that

00:41:40.690 --> 00:41:44.410
when I've talked to teachers
who have kind of catalyzed

00:41:44.410 --> 00:41:46.700
these kinds of cultural
transformations in their schools,

00:41:46.700 --> 00:41:48.270
I think a lot of the
times it's really happened

00:41:48.270 --> 00:41:51.660
with just a handful of teachers
who really started doing it,

00:41:51.660 --> 00:41:52.930
and they really started modeling it,

00:41:52.930 --> 00:41:55.380
and going and talking to
other teachers about it.

00:41:56.741 --> 00:41:58.060
It took some time.

00:41:58.060 --> 00:41:59.780
It wasn't like a we're all gonna do

00:41:59.780 --> 00:42:00.960
growth mindset all at once.

00:42:00.960 --> 00:42:01.900
I think in my experience,

00:42:01.900 --> 00:42:02.960
that usually doesn't work very well.

00:42:02.960 --> 00:42:06.170
It's usually more that
you kind of start around

00:42:06.170 --> 00:42:08.220
this kind of core,
crystal group of teachers,

00:42:08.220 --> 00:42:09.890
and then it kind of
branches off from there.

00:42:09.890 --> 00:42:12.310
And as other teachers can see
the kind of amazing things

00:42:12.310 --> 00:42:16.050
that can happen, and
then they start to say,

00:42:16.050 --> 00:42:17.990
hey, maybe that could work in my class.

00:42:17.990 --> 00:42:20.010
Actually, I'd like to have my kids be

00:42:20.010 --> 00:42:21.640
that inspired or that motivated.

00:42:21.640 --> 00:42:22.506
- That's interesting.

00:42:22.506 --> 00:42:23.339
That's very interesting.

00:42:23.339 --> 00:42:25.090
Actually, I'm very curious to know.

00:42:25.090 --> 00:42:27.670
For Sam, what made you want to try out

00:42:27.670 --> 00:42:29.220
these growth mindset activities?

00:42:29.220 --> 00:42:31.133
What was the catalyst for that?

00:42:32.320 --> 00:42:35.143
- It actually stemmed
in the beginning it was,

00:42:36.710 --> 00:42:40.030
I noticed that my kiddos
were coming without tools.

00:42:40.030 --> 00:42:42.150
At the time, I was in fifth grade

00:42:42.150 --> 00:42:45.710
and I had to send my babies
off to middle school,

00:42:45.710 --> 00:42:49.270
and I wanted them as empowered

00:42:49.270 --> 00:42:51.577
and with as many strategies
as they could possibly have

00:42:51.577 --> 00:42:53.800
before they went because middle school

00:42:53.800 --> 00:42:55.743
could be really difficult years.

00:42:57.090 --> 00:43:00.610
And so, I started looking at
things like their perseverance,

00:43:00.610 --> 00:43:01.900
how did they speak to one another?

00:43:01.900 --> 00:43:03.610
How did they advocate for themselves

00:43:03.610 --> 00:43:04.983
when they need something?

00:43:06.640 --> 00:43:10.170
We started little by little
looking at things like that,

00:43:10.170 --> 00:43:12.560
and I started really kind
of trying to research

00:43:12.560 --> 00:43:16.500
and find things to support that.

00:43:16.500 --> 00:43:18.370
It's funny, we watched, at
the beginning of the year

00:43:18.370 --> 00:43:23.323
I show my kids a video of a
really famous quantum theorist.

00:43:24.170 --> 00:43:25.760
He's melded science and math,

00:43:25.760 --> 00:43:28.980
and he's been working on the
same equation now for 12 years.

00:43:28.980 --> 00:43:30.990
And I promise my kids,
I will never make you

00:43:30.990 --> 00:43:32.710
work on an equation for 12 years.

00:43:32.710 --> 00:43:34.798
But if he can do 12 years,
we can do 20 minutes.

00:43:34.798 --> 00:43:35.631
(laughing)

00:43:35.631 --> 00:43:38.233
We started trying to build that stamina,

00:43:39.335 --> 00:43:41.600
and then it just kind of grew from there,

00:43:41.600 --> 00:43:43.538
and it was kind of the perfect timing.

00:43:43.538 --> 00:43:45.240
Annie's book came out.

00:43:45.240 --> 00:43:47.570
Carol Dweck's book was coming out.

00:43:47.570 --> 00:43:51.260
PERTS is really on the stage now.

00:43:51.260 --> 00:43:53.310
LearnStorm's out, and it
was just it feels like

00:43:53.310 --> 00:43:55.280
a lot of us were seeking this,

00:43:55.280 --> 00:43:57.470
if you look at the manifestation of

00:43:57.470 --> 00:43:59.590
what has really come to the surface.

00:43:59.590 --> 00:44:02.130
So, I think a lot of
teachers at the same time

00:44:02.130 --> 00:44:03.690
really were feeling the same need.

00:44:03.690 --> 00:44:05.060
- Right. That's beautiful.

00:44:05.060 --> 00:44:08.190
Alright, I'm glad we
could help fill that need.

00:44:08.190 --> 00:44:10.060
That makes me feel good.

00:44:10.060 --> 00:44:13.580
Leigh Ann Morgan from Ontario asked,

00:44:13.580 --> 00:44:16.100
are there words and
phrases that foster growth

00:44:16.100 --> 00:44:19.090
that I can include in my
student conversations?

00:44:19.090 --> 00:44:20.850
I think actually all of you

00:44:20.850 --> 00:44:23.110
have touched upon this idea of vocabulary,

00:44:23.110 --> 00:44:26.040
so let's see if we can
try to touch on that.

00:44:27.590 --> 00:44:30.440
- I'm a firm advocate of the power of yet.

00:44:30.440 --> 00:44:32.710
Any time they say any
kind of negative talk,

00:44:32.710 --> 00:44:34.253
I'll point to them, yet.

00:44:34.253 --> 00:44:35.086
(laughing)

00:44:35.086 --> 00:44:36.760
And then they have to say it.

00:44:36.760 --> 00:44:38.920
And then we're big on our, hey, now what?

00:44:38.920 --> 00:44:41.640
Or great, what do you need?

00:44:41.640 --> 00:44:43.670
We practice a lot at the
beginning of the year

00:44:43.670 --> 00:44:47.610
building a toolkit of okay,
I'm stuck now, so what?

00:44:47.610 --> 00:44:49.130
Alright, I can ask for more time.

00:44:49.130 --> 00:44:50.830
I can ask to hear it in a different way.

00:44:50.830 --> 00:44:52.440
I can ask the teacher to rephrase it.

00:44:52.440 --> 00:44:53.610
I can ask.

00:44:53.610 --> 00:44:55.810
We talk about what are different things

00:44:55.810 --> 00:44:59.220
I can do to advocate for myself?

00:44:59.220 --> 00:45:03.170
Because I might not always
be within these four walls

00:45:03.170 --> 00:45:04.360
when I encounter a problem,

00:45:04.360 --> 00:45:06.533
and I need to have those intrinsic skills.

00:45:08.240 --> 00:45:13.200
Having that vocabulary
ready for your kids,

00:45:13.200 --> 00:45:14.950
and then on the teacher's part,

00:45:14.950 --> 00:45:17.570
really trying to back away
from good job, that's right.

00:45:17.570 --> 00:45:19.290
- [Rachel] Mm-hmm. Right.

00:45:19.290 --> 00:45:20.123
- Leave it to the class.

00:45:20.123 --> 00:45:21.620
Mathematicians, what do you think?

00:45:21.620 --> 00:45:23.540
This mathematician has proposed this idea.

00:45:23.540 --> 00:45:24.690
Thoughts?

00:45:24.690 --> 00:45:25.970
You know?

00:45:25.970 --> 00:45:28.290
At the beginning, they
just stare at you like,

00:45:28.290 --> 00:45:30.270
is it right or wrong, you know?

00:45:30.270 --> 00:45:33.170
But they start to learn,
and it's so powerful,

00:45:33.170 --> 00:45:34.600
and it is so hard as a teacher, though,

00:45:34.600 --> 00:45:38.070
when somebody throws something
wildly incorrect out there.

00:45:38.070 --> 00:45:40.300
But the cool thing is, is
there's a lot of grace in that,

00:45:40.300 --> 00:45:42.540
too, because when the
kids start debating it

00:45:42.540 --> 00:45:44.500
and discussing it, we talk about

00:45:44.500 --> 00:45:46.030
do you have the right to change your mind?

00:45:46.030 --> 00:45:49.350
And the kid'll say, oh, I'd
like to change my answer.

00:45:49.350 --> 00:45:51.380
And I think there's so much power in

00:45:51.380 --> 00:45:54.303
how kids speak to each other
and speak to themselves.

00:45:55.420 --> 00:45:57.270
It's hard for the teacher
kind of backing up

00:45:57.270 --> 00:45:59.770
and just giving those launch points,

00:45:59.770 --> 00:46:02.702
those launching questions, and then

00:46:02.702 --> 00:46:05.180
you're crowd control at that point.

00:46:05.180 --> 00:46:06.350
- [Rachel] Right. Very good.

00:46:06.350 --> 00:46:09.300
- I think just being
mindful of person praise

00:46:09.300 --> 00:46:10.840
versus process praise.

00:46:10.840 --> 00:46:13.910
If we say to a kid who does really well,

00:46:13.910 --> 00:46:16.800
oh, you're so smart, they equate

00:46:16.800 --> 00:46:18.360
doing well with being smart.

00:46:18.360 --> 00:46:21.600
That it's some inherent,
inborn thing that they have

00:46:21.600 --> 00:46:22.807
that they can do well.

00:46:22.807 --> 00:46:25.010
And then when inevitably
they hit a setback,

00:46:25.010 --> 00:46:27.660
which they will, and
they don't do so well,

00:46:27.660 --> 00:46:29.520
then all of a sudden
it's like a question of,

00:46:29.520 --> 00:46:32.280
well if I'm not smart, then who am I?

00:46:32.280 --> 00:46:35.290
So, just being mindful of praising effort

00:46:35.290 --> 00:46:37.200
and the process that they took to learn,

00:46:37.200 --> 00:46:39.610
like that was a really
great strategy you used,

00:46:39.610 --> 00:46:41.620
or I like how you solved that problem.

00:46:41.620 --> 00:46:42.810
Or if they breeze through something

00:46:42.810 --> 00:46:44.310
maybe that wasn't challenging enough.

00:46:44.310 --> 00:46:45.490
Let's try to find something else.

00:46:45.490 --> 00:46:47.560
So, being mindful of that.

00:46:47.560 --> 00:46:50.060
Being more robust with your feedback.

00:46:50.060 --> 00:46:53.660
I think we like to use stickers
and say good job a lot.

00:46:53.660 --> 00:46:55.440
In the book I wrote, we call it,

00:46:55.440 --> 00:46:56.520
well, I read it somewhere else,

00:46:56.520 --> 00:46:57.690
but they call it Paula Praise.

00:46:57.690 --> 00:47:01.200
So, on American Idol, if you
think back to American Idol,

00:47:01.200 --> 00:47:04.549
like the first with Simon,
and Paula and Randy,

00:47:04.549 --> 00:47:06.746
Paula would always say, good job!

00:47:06.746 --> 00:47:08.470
(speech drowned out by laughter)

00:47:08.470 --> 00:47:11.430
And Simon was a lot meaner,
but he was much more specific.

00:47:11.430 --> 00:47:13.400
And so, you don't want to be like that,

00:47:13.400 --> 00:47:17.170
but definitely be specific in the feedback

00:47:17.170 --> 00:47:18.173
that you're giving.

00:47:19.180 --> 00:47:21.940
I would rather have less
feedback that's more specific

00:47:21.940 --> 00:47:25.880
than generalized praise
that is really meaningless.

00:47:25.880 --> 00:47:28.760
So, you want to be mindful of that,

00:47:28.760 --> 00:47:32.380
and then yeah, just thinking about that,

00:47:32.380 --> 00:47:35.700
I used to say, come on, you can do this.

00:47:35.700 --> 00:47:37.510
It's so easy.

00:47:37.510 --> 00:47:39.000
That was something I said as a teacher,

00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:40.900
and I look back and think, oh my gosh.

00:47:40.900 --> 00:47:41.733
You know what?

00:47:41.733 --> 00:47:43.120
That wasn't easy for that person.

00:47:43.120 --> 00:47:43.953
- [Rachel] Right.

00:47:43.953 --> 00:47:46.230
- It was easy for me, or
I thought it was easy,

00:47:46.230 --> 00:47:47.640
but it wasn't easy for that person,

00:47:47.640 --> 00:47:50.740
and so what I was saying
was actually not helping.

00:47:50.740 --> 00:47:52.110
It was counterproductive.

00:47:52.110 --> 00:47:54.210
And I thought I was being helpful.

00:47:54.210 --> 00:47:56.670
So, just really be mindful
of what you're saying

00:47:56.670 --> 00:48:00.030
and how that affects the
student that you're working with

00:48:00.030 --> 00:48:00.863
is really important.

00:48:00.863 --> 00:48:03.630
- Yeah, and I really
love all those points.

00:48:03.630 --> 00:48:05.980
Yeah, I guess just from a
growth mindset standpoint,

00:48:05.980 --> 00:48:09.650
I think the kinds of language we use,

00:48:09.650 --> 00:48:11.760
the kinds of words we use is
gonna be really important,

00:48:11.760 --> 00:48:14.101
and there are, so for example,

00:48:14.101 --> 00:48:16.040
are you referring to
things as, for example,

00:48:16.040 --> 00:48:17.670
we can talk about building skills.

00:48:17.670 --> 00:48:20.140
Like, really calling out
when you're doing something

00:48:20.140 --> 00:48:21.150
of why are you doing it?

00:48:21.150 --> 00:48:22.590
Oh, you're building your skills.

00:48:22.590 --> 00:48:24.193
You're becoming a mathematician.

00:48:25.070 --> 00:48:27.150
You're building your
writing skills right now,

00:48:27.150 --> 00:48:28.993
or you're becoming a better writer.

00:48:31.770 --> 00:48:33.700
Really focusing students
on those processes,

00:48:33.700 --> 00:48:35.930
and then kind of how the
fact that they're learning

00:48:35.930 --> 00:48:38.500
while they're doing, so kinda taking,

00:48:38.500 --> 00:48:41.430
again, taking the focus
off of the end result,

00:48:41.430 --> 00:48:43.140
and really focusing it on the thing

00:48:43.140 --> 00:48:45.510
that students can actually
control for themselves,

00:48:45.510 --> 00:48:46.850
which is the process that they're doing.

00:48:46.850 --> 00:48:49.270
And really reminding them and
kind of debriefing with them

00:48:49.270 --> 00:48:50.630
so that they really understand

00:48:50.630 --> 00:48:51.640
what it is that they're doing,

00:48:51.640 --> 00:48:53.600
and that all this effort
that they're doing,

00:48:53.600 --> 00:48:55.050
it's not just going into a grade.

00:48:55.050 --> 00:48:57.320
It's going to them leveling up.

00:48:57.320 --> 00:48:59.840
Them becoming a writer, them
becoming a mathematician,

00:48:59.840 --> 00:49:01.940
or a scientist, or whatever that may be.

00:49:01.940 --> 00:49:03.078
A great civic thinker.

00:49:03.078 --> 00:49:04.080
(laughing)

00:49:04.080 --> 00:49:06.630
Whatever that may be, they're
really developing those skills

00:49:06.630 --> 00:49:09.260
and really making sure to call out that

00:49:09.260 --> 00:49:12.900
that learning process that
they're enacting in your class.

00:49:12.900 --> 00:49:15.110
- Right, so not just work
for the sake of work,

00:49:15.110 --> 00:49:17.174
but work for the sake of--

00:49:17.174 --> 00:49:18.007
- Of growth.

00:49:18.007 --> 00:49:19.050
- Of growth and betterment.

00:49:19.050 --> 00:49:20.170
I love that.

00:49:20.170 --> 00:49:22.630
Alright, so we're gonna wrap up.

00:49:22.630 --> 00:49:25.200
I'm going to actually throw
you a bit of a curve ball

00:49:25.200 --> 00:49:28.440
and ask you a final question,
but with a challenge.

00:49:28.440 --> 00:49:32.160
So, what is one last piece
of advice for teachers

00:49:32.160 --> 00:49:35.270
for fostering growth mindset
that you would give this year

00:49:35.270 --> 00:49:37.758
if you can give it in 10 words or less?

00:49:37.758 --> 00:49:39.760
(laughing) I know.

00:49:39.760 --> 00:49:41.510
Alright, I'm gonna start with Dave.

00:49:43.010 --> 00:49:44.970
- Have a growth mindset about

00:49:44.970 --> 00:49:47.700
building a growth mindset culture.

00:49:47.700 --> 00:49:48.680
Is that too much?

00:49:48.680 --> 00:49:49.595
- I think I did that right.

00:49:49.595 --> 00:49:50.630
(laughing)

00:49:50.630 --> 00:49:52.980
Alright, go ahead Annie.

00:49:52.980 --> 00:49:54.110
One last piece of advice for teachers.

00:49:54.110 --> 00:49:59.110
- I would say model your
growth and fixed mindsets,

00:49:59.920 --> 00:50:03.265
and normalize mistakes in your classroom.

00:50:03.265 --> 00:50:04.410
(laughing)

00:50:04.410 --> 00:50:05.408
- Well done, well done.

00:50:05.408 --> 00:50:06.241
- [Annie] Thank you.

00:50:06.241 --> 00:50:07.074
- I like it.

00:50:07.074 --> 00:50:08.270
Alright, Sam, your last turn.

00:50:08.270 --> 00:50:09.103
- Okay.

00:50:10.150 --> 00:50:11.420
Be vulnerable.

00:50:11.420 --> 00:50:12.930
- [Rachel] Mm-hmm.

00:50:12.930 --> 00:50:16.040
- Be a champion for your kids, and model.

00:50:16.040 --> 00:50:16.888
- [Rachel] I love that.

00:50:16.888 --> 00:50:17.721
- Okay.

00:50:17.721 --> 00:50:18.780
- That was very good,
and all very tweetable.

00:50:18.780 --> 00:50:19.683
Very great.

00:50:19.683 --> 00:50:20.516
(laughing)

00:50:20.516 --> 00:50:23.150
So, I want to thank
Dave, and Annie, and Sam

00:50:23.150 --> 00:50:24.470
for joining us today.

00:50:24.470 --> 00:50:27.990
I learned something and I
hope that you all did, too.

00:50:27.990 --> 00:50:29.530
I want to remind everyone that

00:50:29.530 --> 00:50:31.410
there's still time to sign up,

00:50:31.410 --> 00:50:32.880
so if you haven't signed up,

00:50:32.880 --> 00:50:35.860
please sign up right now, today,

00:50:35.860 --> 00:50:37.993
but definitely by the end of October.

00:50:38.949 --> 00:50:42.670
And if you keep on tagging
your classroom celebrations

00:50:42.670 --> 00:50:45.560
with #learnstorm on Twitter and Facebook,

00:50:45.560 --> 00:50:47.930
we really love seeing it in the office,

00:50:47.930 --> 00:50:50.000
so please keep on doing that.

00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:51.690
Welcome back to the
school years, teachers.

00:50:51.690 --> 00:50:53.113
Thank you, and goodbye.
