about which came first is the following

first we think that out of the Big Bang

00:00:40.209 --> 00:00:40.219
first we think that out of the Big Bang
 

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:44.529

came dark matter invisible matter if I

00:00:44.529 --> 00:00:44.539
came dark matter invisible matter if I
 

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:46.809
came dark matter invisible matter if I
held dark matter in my hand it would

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:46.819
held dark matter in my hand it would
 

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:49.209
held dark matter in my hand it would
literally lose its way right through my

00:00:49.209 --> 00:00:49.219
literally lose its way right through my
 

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:51.700

earth go to China and then go back and

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:54.319
earth go to China and then go back and
 

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:56.770
earth go to China and then go back and
forth between China and my hand

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:56.780
forth between China and my hand
 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:59.020

that's dark matter we think that dark

00:00:59.020 --> 00:00:59.030
that's dark matter we think that dark
 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.209
that's dark matter we think that dark
matter began to clump first because of

00:01:01.209 --> 00:01:01.219
matter began to clump first because of
 

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:04.420
matter began to clump first because of
gravity then matter was attracted to the

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:04.430
gravity then matter was attracted to the
 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:06.490
gravity then matter was attracted to the
clumpiness creating the supermassive

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:06.500
clumpiness creating the supermassive
 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.250
clumpiness creating the supermassive
black hole and then later the galaxy

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:09.260
black hole and then later the galaxy
 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.280
black hole and then later the galaxy
itself began to form we have computer

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:12.290
itself began to form we have computer
 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:14.440
itself began to form we have computer
simulations about this but still the

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:14.450
simulations about this but still the
 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:16.570
simulations about this but still the
relationship is not yet clear

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:16.580
relationship is not yet clear
 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.180
relationship is not yet clear
now remember stars we know almost

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:19.190
now remember stars we know almost
 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:21.700
now remember stars we know almost
everything about stellar evolution

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:21.710
everything about stellar evolution
 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:23.950
everything about stellar evolution
that's because the Pentagon has given us

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:23.960
that's because the Pentagon has given us
 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:25.990
that's because the Pentagon has given us
physicists billions of dollars to model

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:26.000
physicists billions of dollars to model
 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.720

hydrogen bombs and a star is nothing but

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:28.730
hydrogen bombs and a star is nothing but
 

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:31.420
hydrogen bombs and a star is nothing but
a hydrogen bomb however a galaxy

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:31.430
a hydrogen bomb however a galaxy
 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:33.880
a hydrogen bomb however a galaxy
consists of over a hundred billion stars

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:33.890
consists of over a hundred billion stars
 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:36.610
consists of over a hundred billion stars
so it's much more difficult to tell

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:36.620
so it's much more difficult to tell
 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:39.430
so it's much more difficult to tell
which came first the black hole or the

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:39.440
which came first the black hole or the
 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.310
which came first the black hole or the
Galaxy itself
