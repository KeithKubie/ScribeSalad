00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.610
We're given two points, so we can start by finding the slope. I'm going to label

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:11.114
this point x1, y1, and this point x2, y2. For y2, I plug in 5. For y1, I plug in

00:00:11.114 --> 00:00:16.774
negative 1. And for x2, I plug in negative 2. And finally, for x1, we plug in 3.

00:00:16.775 --> 00:00:22.862
5 plus 1 makes 6 and negative 2 minus 3 is negative 5, so we have negative 6

00:00:22.862 --> 00:00:27.425
5ths as our slope. Now that we have the slope, we can use our slope formula

00:00:27.425 --> 00:00:31.492
again and fix one of the points to be x and y. These two variables will appear

00:00:31.492 --> 00:00:36.233
in our equation. We can plug in negative 6 5ths in for the slope and then we can

00:00:36.233 --> 00:00:41.294
use our other point 3 and negative 1 for x1 and y1, that's this point here.

00:00:41.295 --> 00:00:47.009
Simplifying the y minus negative 1, I get y plus 1. Now that we're here, we want

00:00:47.009 --> 00:00:51.041
to find an equation in slope intercept form, so we want to solve this equation

00:00:51.041 --> 00:00:56.691
for y. I can multiply both sides by 5 times x minus 3. We do this as 5 times x

00:00:56.691 --> 00:01:01.222
minus 3 is a common denominator for these two fractions. Notice that we just

00:01:01.222 --> 00:01:05.239
have factors that appear in the numerator, and also in the denominators. This x

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:10.324
minus 3 is just one factor. We use these factors to help us simplify. We know 5

00:01:10.324 --> 00:01:16.284
divided by 5 makes 1, and x minus 3 divided by x minus 3 also makes 1. So we

00:01:16.284 --> 00:01:22.207
have x minus 3 times negative 6 equals y plus 1 times 5. We could have gotten to

00:01:22.207 --> 00:01:27.243
this step just by cross-multiplying. Negative 6 times x minus 3 on the left. And

00:01:27.243 --> 00:01:32.657
5 times y plus 1 on the right. Pretty cool. I distribute the negative 6 to the x

00:01:32.657 --> 00:01:37.480
and the negative 3. And I distribute the 5 to the y and the positive 1. Our goal

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:42.336
here is to get y by itself. So let's isolate this 5y term. We can subtract 5

00:01:42.336 --> 00:01:46.683
from both sides to get negative 6x plus 13 equals 5 times y, and then we divide

00:01:46.683 --> 00:01:52.756
both sides of our equation by 5. So I have negative 6 5ths times x on the left,

00:01:52.756 --> 00:01:57.200
but 13 5ths equals 1y. It's probably best to continue solving down the page, I

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:02.070
just wanted to show our work all in one place. I can rewrite this fraction as

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.420
negative 6 5ths times x. We know multiplication and division have the same

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.911
priority in the order of operations. I could do multiplication, and then the

00:02:09.911 --> 00:02:14.314
division. Or I could do division, and then the multiplication. These two are

00:02:14.314 --> 00:02:18.520
exactly the same. Finally, we can just flip our equation around to get our

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:22.050
answer in slope intercept form. We can check one part of our answer. We

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:26.163
calculated the slope to be negative 6 5ths earlier in our problem. Well sure

00:02:26.163 --> 00:02:30.148
enough, we get negative 6 5ths in our answer. We know that this part of the

00:02:30.148 --> 00:02:34.523
problem should be correct so long as our calculation from above was correct.
