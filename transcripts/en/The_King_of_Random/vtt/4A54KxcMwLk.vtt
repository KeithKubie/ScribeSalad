Hey guys!!! Grant here

00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:03.930
Just popping in to remind you that king of random t-shirts are available for Christmas.

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:05.779
Click the link at the top of the description

00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:07.980
To get yourself a random happens ignite the fire within or

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:11.580
Caution! random experiments in progress, I don't know how long we're gonna have them

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.399
But they're available now so go get yourself a king of random t-shirt while you can

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.770
Hey guys, I'm Nate with the king of random and today

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:17.730
We are going to show you

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.940
How to make a custom mold on the Mario Kart shells

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:20.969
That we made in our last video

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:23.960
Previously we showed you how to take a rigid insulation foam

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.820
Build it up and carve it into a custom design from your favorite video

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.799
game or movie we want to make these props more permanently out of fiberglass and the first step to doing that is to make a

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.779
custom silicone mold so the purpose of today's video is to learn how to make a mold on these Mario Kart shells

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:42.809
remember that these steps don't only apply to Mario Kart shells the same principles will work on just about any shape you've got in the

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.339
Last video we showed how to prep our foam by using a layer of latex house paint and then spackling to fill in any gaps?

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.039
Or cracks in the foam now before we start adding the rubber

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.409
Let's quickly add a layer of spray paint to smooth everything down

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:56.519
The latex house paint makes it so that we'll be able to remove the silicone mold more easily

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.259
But it also creates a barrier that lets us cover the shell in spray paint, otherwise the paint could melt the foam.

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:13.199
Our spray paint has dried I'm gonna set the shell in this bowl to hold it steady now. Let's mix up some silicone

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:20.459
All right, we've got six ounces of silicone

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.629
So we need to add one tenth of that for the catalyst that will be point six ounces

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.270
We've got the catalyst added to the silicone now, let's mix it up and paint it onto our shell

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:01.590
There we go our first layer of silicone is painted on you can see it

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:07.200
I've only covered about half the shell my plan is I'm gonna build up three layers of silicone on one side flip it over and

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.689
Then paint on the other side the silicone actually bonds to itself extremely well so when I paint it on the other side and let

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.980
It overlap with the first layers

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:20.100
It will glue itself together into one continuous piece the first layer of our silicone has now cured, so let's mix up the next one

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:24.210
This stuff gets everywhere

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:31.769
Since this isn't the first layer I actually want to make the silicone a little bit thicker so I have here a clear gel

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:34.409
That's called pixiv tropic, and it's extremely powerful

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:40.260
Just about one drop of this will make the silicone much thicker almost like peanut butter or mayonnaise

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:59.439
There we have it layer number two is applied and it's lot thicker than the first layer

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.440
Let's let back here, and then add one more

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:05.530
I've upgraded to a larger cut because I was almost spilling it before

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.270
The third layer of silicone is cured

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:25.429
And it's ready to flip it over and paint silicone on the other side before I start adding silicone really quickly

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:27.770
I'm just going to cut off these excess drips sticking up

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:33.560
Last time I used six ounces on the first layer, and I had a little bit left over

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:35.560
So I'm just going to start with five ounces this time

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:52.570
Time for another layer

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:01.069
This right here is a piece of cured silicone that we're going to cut in half and attach as a sort of belt that goes

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:06.559
All the way around the ridge on the shelf this piece was originally made by pouring silicone into a mold that was made by attaching

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:10.699
Four slats to a flat surface to make it a better size for how we're going to use it

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:12.700
I'm going to cut it in half lengthwise with a razor blade

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:23.668
Now let's mix up a really thick batch of the silicone to use as glue to attach these other pieces of silicone to the side

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:26.788
Of the shell normally we would add point eight ounces of catalyst

00:04:26.789 --> 00:04:29.729
But I'm going to add a little bit extra so it catalyzes extra quickly

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:35.519
And I want this to be extra thick so I'm adding more of the fix of tropic substance than I did before

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:43.529
Now I'm going to use this extra thick silicone to glue this on the purpose of this Ridge is to have a

00:04:43.629 --> 00:04:46.408
Dividing point to remove the mold after I'm done

00:04:46.409 --> 00:04:50.069
I'll cut along this strip of silicone and peel the two parts of the mold apart

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:56.669
This will give us a nice sturdy edge to build up to with our mold jacket and for casting the fiberglass even once we're done

00:04:56.889 --> 00:05:00.869
First I'm laying down a nice thick coat of this silicone all along the runner now

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:04.259
I'm going to pick it up and carefully start applying it to the edge of the shell

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:10.649
You can see that it's already starting to Sag

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:13.350
It doesn't like to stick to the edge of the shell very well, so what we're gonna

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:17.730
Do is use some straight pins to stab through the silicon and hold it in place?

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:23.219
You'll want to make sure that the pins you're using are longer than the silicon gate is thick to make sure that it will secure

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:25.220
It well to see the rest of your mold

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:33.669
Now I'm just smoothing out the edge of the silicone to fill in all the gaps

00:05:33.949 --> 00:05:38.559
This will also help ensure a nice strong connection between the strip of silicone and the rest of your mold

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:43.119
I'm measuring how much of this others crypto silicone will need and then I'll use a razor blade to cut it off there

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:55.309
Our turtle mold is starting to look something like a UFO

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:57.529
I've got a little bit of a gap between the two

00:05:57.530 --> 00:05:59.530
So I'll just fill it in using some of my leftover

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:04.640
Silicone if you have places where your strip of silicone is pulling away from the mold just add more pins

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:07.130
Sometimes it can help to drive them in at different angles

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:10.760
I've got a little bit left over of this extra thick silicone so what I'm gonna

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:16.250
Do is use it to fill in a little bit of the neck of the turtle shell this will make it easier for the mold

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:18.250
Jacket to come on and off of the mold

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:23.629
Now that the silicone holding the strip onto the shell is cured. It's time to make a mold jacket

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:29.180
The mold jacket is a rigid shell that we use to help the mold keep its shape as we cast our fiberglass in it will

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:33.440
Have a wool jacket on either side of the shell which will separate apart into two dish like shapes

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:36.020
We'll mix our plaster of Paris with some water in the bowl

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:40.520
And then we'll add some strands of hemp rope to give it strength technically this rope isn't made from hemp

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:43.669
It's called Manila rope, but it's often called hemp because it's really similar

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:49.429
Untwist and separate the rope until you just have the plain fibers cut off pieces of the fiber about an inch long

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:58.699
Now let's add plaster tour water and keep mixing it up until it's a really thick consistency almost like dough a

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:08.599
Proper mixture has almost two times as much plaster as it does water by volume

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:16.220
You can see that the plaster is now thick enough that it leaves ridges and marks in it if you run your fingers through it

00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:18.220
This means we're getting close

00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:21.560
The plaster is now nice and thick so it's time to start adding the rope fibers

00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:24.019
You want enough for a nice even distribution?

00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:29.599
Of fiber all throughout the plaster these fibers will make the plaster a lot stronger and a little bit more flexible

00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:32.480
Our plaster is now all mixed up with the rope fibers in it

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:35.810
And we have to apply it quickly because we only have a few minutes before it starts to set

00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:43.759
We want to apply an even layer of plaster all over our shell try for about 3/8 of an inch thick

00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:47.150
The plaster doesn't have to reach all the way to the edge of the silicone strip

00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:51.199
But it should overlap a little bit this will help with the strength of your mold jacket and prevent cracking

00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:54.889
Use just a little bit of water to smooth down the surface of your mold

00:07:57.630 --> 00:08:02.390
Once the plaster dries it will be very hard so any ridges left in the plaster will become sharp and Scratchy

00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:08.330
We're finished with this side and as soon as it's dry we'll turn it over and do the same thing to the other side

00:08:10.770 --> 00:08:12.770
Plaster our

00:08:17.570 --> 00:08:19.240
Once this piece of plaster is dry

00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:21.430
It'll be time to remove the two pieces of the mold jacket

00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:26.770
And then cut along the seam of rubber to remove our mold first look pull out all of these pins oh

00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:33.700
That's why you should try and grab the wire part of the pin and not the head of the pin

00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:39.549
So that wouldn't kind of bent going in alright now. We have to get under the plaster and pry it off

00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:42.370
There we go there. We go oh

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:45.400
Yeah

00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:51.160
Shell of our shell the other side here we go there we go

00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:59.050
Yeah now we have to cut the silicone off by slicing through the belt attached to the middle

00:09:10.570 --> 00:09:13.619
All right, we've cut all the way through now, let's peel it off

00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:20.520
There we go

00:09:24.910 --> 00:09:26.999
There we go our mold is removed

00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:36.750
Decide into its mold jacket there. We have a completed turtle shell mold in our last video

00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:41.850
we showed you how to take a block of foam and carve it into the shape of a replica movie or video game piece of

00:09:41.850 --> 00:09:48.209
Your choice. I chose this mariokart shell because I've done them before for Devin Supertramp, and I love the game Mario Kart today

00:09:48.210 --> 00:09:54.389
We showed you how to take silicone rubber casting plaster and some fibrous rope and turn that into a mold of your creation

00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:57.389
We first coated the whole thing in a few layers of silicone rubber

00:09:57.520 --> 00:10:00.299
We added a belt along the middle of it as a seam

00:10:00.340 --> 00:10:01.630
We then took plaster

00:10:01.630 --> 00:10:07.950
Mixed with pieces of our fibrous rope and made a shell that went over our silicone mold once both pieces of the plaster were dry

00:10:07.950 --> 00:10:12.420
we were able to pry them off of the silicone mold cut along the belt we had left on the center and

00:10:12.610 --> 00:10:16.350
Removed the silicone rubber from our masterpiece again

00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:21.299
I want to point out that you don't have to make mariokart shells if you're not interested in that you can use these same principles

00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:27.390
On a variety of shapes from whatever game movie or your own imagination that you want in our next video

00:10:27.390 --> 00:10:29.670
We're going to show you how to cast fiberglass in your molds

00:10:29.670 --> 00:10:33.449
So you can make pieces put them together to clean it up and paint it to have a finished product

00:10:33.610 --> 00:10:35.250
Thanks for joining us for this project

00:10:35.250 --> 00:10:38.429
And we look forward to showing you how to finish it up in the next one talk to you then

00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:47.880
Looks like frosting or maybe taffy some kind of candy don't eat it time for the other side

00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:52.620
Like having tentacles

00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:55.200
That they can't control it

00:10:56.500 --> 00:10:59.849
