00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.590
Joining me today is a sex researcher,
a neuroscientist,

2
00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:13.410
and cohost of the Bronx speak podcast,
Dr Deborah.
So welcome to the Rubin report.

3
00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:17.670
Hi,
I am glad to have you here.
Finally.
I'm so happy to be here.
All right.

4
00:00:17.671 --> 00:00:21.480
We got a lot to talk about.
I thought the best way to start this thing,

5
00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.100
I don't like to look at my notes up front,

6
00:00:23.101 --> 00:00:27.150
but you had a line on your patrion page that I thought summed up the whole damn

7
00:00:27.151 --> 00:00:28.230
thing pretty perfectly.

8
00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.410
You're patrion bio says creating journalism that defense science and free

9
00:00:33.511 --> 00:00:38.250
speech.
You come to the right show.
All right.
I think so,

10
00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.340
yeah.
Okay.
Should we talk about sex first?

11
00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.550
Should we just start with sex and then can you talk to it all bleeds into one

12
00:00:44.551 --> 00:00:48.780
thing?
Definitely.
Yeah.
Um,
okay.
Uh,
you started as a neuroscientist,

13
00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.400
but you were sort of more attracted,
for lack of a better word,

14
00:00:53.401 --> 00:00:55.920
to studying sex.
Tell me about that.

15
00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:00.010
<v 2>Yeah,
so I mean,
I decided to go back to school and do my phd in neuroscience.</v>

16
00:01:00.011 --> 00:01:03.040
And along the way,
I had the chance to do a placement in sexology.

17
00:01:03.041 --> 00:01:06.520
So I'd never heard of sex research before.
I had no idea what it was,

18
00:01:06.521 --> 00:01:10.270
but it was so fascinating to me and I thought it's crazy that we have the

19
00:01:10.271 --> 00:01:13.750
technology to look at people's brains and look at sexual arousal in the brain.

20
00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:18.280
And it tells us so much about what it means to be human.
So from,
from there,

21
00:01:18.281 --> 00:01:19.540
I was hooked.
I loved it.

22
00:01:19.541 --> 00:01:24.541
And my phd was in using brain imaging to look at Paraphilias,

23
00:01:24.551 --> 00:01:29.510
which are atypical sexual interest and hypersexuality and men.
Um,

24
00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.420
and I love research.
I always will.

25
00:01:31.421 --> 00:01:36.421
But then I made the decision to leave academia and work full time as a

26
00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.430
journalist now because the climate had changed so much,

27
00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:41.950
even between when I started my phd and when I,
when I finished.

28
00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.311
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

29
00:01:42.311 --> 00:01:45.640
And that's why the stuff that you're talking about really is at the nexus of

30
00:01:45.641 --> 00:01:49.090
everything that I'm doing here.
Because now you're on the journalist side,

31
00:01:49.091 --> 00:01:54.091
but it's because of the hostility that you were facing on the academic side.

32
00:01:54.881 --> 00:01:55.600
So what were you,

33
00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:00.160
what is it that you were unearthing or studying that was so triggering to
people?

34
00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.950
<v 2>Hmm.
Well within sexology,
you can't really study anything that isn't triggering,</v>

35
00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.280
I'd say across the board,
someone's going to get mad at you no matter what.

36
00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:09.563
But uh,

37
00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:11.760
<v 1>no,
you're really looking at facts.
You're,
look,
you're,</v>

38
00:02:11.761 --> 00:02:12.950
you're looking to find facts.

39
00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.240
<v 2>Yeah,
exactly.
And even with brain imaging,
I mean that's,
that's definitely,</v>

40
00:02:16.241 --> 00:02:19.150
it's a growing field.
The technology is legitimate,

41
00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.300
but no matter what I think because sex is still considered very taboo,

42
00:02:22.301 --> 00:02:27.280
people will either project their own ideas and beliefs and values onto it or are

43
00:02:27.281 --> 00:02:30.670
they just don't see the value and they think,
why is the government funding this?

44
00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:34.450
I feel really lucky being in Canada,
we do have a pretty amazing,
uh,

45
00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.100
seen in terms of sex research and my colleagues do manage to get funding.

46
00:02:39.101 --> 00:02:43.780
So I think that's excellent.
But my decision to leave academia,
uh,

47
00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:46.750
in the last two years I noticed things were starting to go a bit weird.

48
00:02:46.751 --> 00:02:50.770
And in terms of the climate and in terms of mainstream media,

49
00:02:50.771 --> 00:02:55.771
I was seeing piece after piece about transgender kids and how young children

50
00:02:56.471 --> 00:03:00.370
were socially transitioning,
getting on,
um,
pubertal,

51
00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.390
pubertal blockers.
And the media was basically saying,
this is the greatest thing.

52
00:03:04.391 --> 00:03:06.280
This is something that we should rejoice about,

53
00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:10.510
that these kids are so much better off after.
But from a scientific perspective,

54
00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:14.710
the research actually shows that the majority of kids who are gender dysphoric

55
00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:16.450
actually outgrow their feelings.

56
00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:19.720
They're more likely to grow up to be gay in adulthood,
not transgender.

57
00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:21.730
And so it makes sense for them to wait,

58
00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:26.260
not for them to socially transition at a young age.
So I wanted to write,
um,

59
00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:30.700
a mainstream piece about this and there's been a very long standing history

60
00:03:30.701 --> 00:03:34.390
between trans activists and,
uh,
sex researchers,

61
00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:38.230
very ugly history of activists going after sex researchers if they don't like

62
00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.380
what someone's study says or what they say publicly.

63
00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:43.630
So I thought about it for a long time.

64
00:03:43.631 --> 00:03:46.780
I wrote the piece and I sat on it probably for about six months and I wasn't

65
00:03:46.781 --> 00:03:48.190
sure if I wanted to put it out.

66
00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.520
I asked a bunch of my colleagues and mentors and they all said,
you know what?

67
00:03:51.521 --> 00:03:54.610
The science is solid,
but you know,

68
00:03:54.611 --> 00:03:56.830
you know what's going to happen if you do put this out.

69
00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:59.260
And at the time I wanted to stay in academia and I said,

70
00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:02.200
should I wait till I get tenure?
And everyone told me,

71
00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:04.830
even if you have tenure nowadays,
it's not going to protect you.

72
00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:07.480
You can still lose your job.
So I decided to actually,

73
00:04:07.481 --> 00:04:08.950
I couldn't stay quiet and I thought,

74
00:04:08.951 --> 00:04:12.520
I'm not going to stay in an environment where I can't speak the truth and I

75
00:04:12.521 --> 00:04:16.000
can't even pursue questions that are meaningful anymore because I have to worry

76
00:04:16.001 --> 00:04:19.270
about who's going to get mad and then I'm going to lose my money and my funding

77
00:04:19.271 --> 00:04:22.930
and I'm gonna lose my job.
So that piece went out.
Um,

78
00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:25.780
it was called the white transgender kids show wait to transition.

79
00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:27.160
And then I haven't looked back since.

80
00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:31.280
<v 1>Yeah.
So I re-read,
I've read the piece before,
but I reread it this morning.</v>

81
00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:35.540
Thank you.
Got here and there.
There's a lot here.

82
00:04:35.541 --> 00:04:37.660
So be,

83
00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:41.660
how much of this is just bleed is just blatantly a misunderstanding of science.

84
00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:42.350
Like,

85
00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:45.460
I think there's partly that you have a misunderstanding of science and then you

86
00:04:45.461 --> 00:04:48.140
just have activists who just want you to bow to them all the time.

87
00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:52.820
Are you able to sort of quantify how much of the backlash is each?

88
00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:57.470
<v 2>I think to be charitable,
I try to look at the other side and give them,
you know,</v>

89
00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:02.170
credit and try to,
you know,
think that they have good intentions,
maybe people,

90
00:05:02.171 --> 00:05:03.580
I mean it's pretty consistent.

91
00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:06.970
All 11 studies ever done on the topic of desistence.

92
00:05:06.971 --> 00:05:10.750
So this phenomenon I talked about where kids grow out of their feelings of

93
00:05:10.751 --> 00:05:12.940
gender dysphoria,
all of them say the same thing.

94
00:05:12.941 --> 00:05:15.850
So the final statistic is about 60 to 90%.

95
00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:21.190
So this is the vast majority of kids.
You can't really question those data.

96
00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:23.860
So I think what it could be as people,

97
00:05:23.861 --> 00:05:28.420
I mean trans people have a history of having to deal with medical gatekeeping of

98
00:05:28.421 --> 00:05:30.850
people telling them they don't really what they feel isn't real.

99
00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:34.570
I do think gender dysphoria is a real phenomenon and I do think we should have

100
00:05:34.571 --> 00:05:36.820
empathy for people who are suffering.
Um,

101
00:05:36.821 --> 00:05:39.880
so I think it could be coming from that of,
of that place of,
well,

102
00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:43.510
we don't want people saying that this isn't a legitimate thing or that trans

103
00:05:43.511 --> 00:05:48.490
people should be forced to not feel the way they do.
But,
um,
in terms of,

104
00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:52.180
you know,
these children,
we should be thinking about the best outcome.

105
00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:55.270
So it doesn't make sense for them to transition if that's not actually going to

106
00:05:55.271 --> 00:05:58.520
help them in the long term.
I try to give people the benefit of the doubt,

107
00:05:58.521 --> 00:06:01.940
but I do think the activists,
they,
on some level,

108
00:06:01.941 --> 00:06:06.560
I think they know that they can bully sex researchers because of that history.

109
00:06:06.561 --> 00:06:11.210
They know that there's only so much an academic can do and they've won a couple

110
00:06:11.211 --> 00:06:13.220
bottles.
So I think that's part of it as well.

111
00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:18.190
<v 1>How shocking was it to you when you were discussing this with colleagues,
um,</v>

112
00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:21.550
that they were kind of hinting,
you may want to wait on this thing?
I mean,

113
00:06:21.551 --> 00:06:25.720
did you think that you'd be in that situation?
And I'm wondering,

114
00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:30.010
did any of them sit on some other things because they were afraid to,

115
00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:35.540
<v 2>hmm.
It was eyeopening.
Yeah.
Um,
but I,</v>

116
00:06:35.541 --> 00:06:39.600
I kind of knew,
um,
one,
one I guess instance,

117
00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:43.130
I can talk about it as one colleague Michael Bailey at Northwestern university,

118
00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:47.300
he wrote a book that upset transgender activists.
Um,

119
00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:49.700
and they went off after I'm ruthlessly,
I mean,

120
00:06:49.701 --> 00:06:52.520
they really tried to destroy his life and thankfully,
you know,
he's,

121
00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:57.710
he's still considered one of the foremost experts in sexology internationally.

122
00:06:58.070 --> 00:07:01.400
But I would say that,
you know,
I've written about him previously.

123
00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:05.120
I think he's kind of been the poster boy as to why people are really terrified

124
00:07:05.121 --> 00:07:07.330
to say anything that goes against the Trans Narrative.

125
00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:11.220
<v 1>Yeah.
So I think you've already hinted at this and I know your work otherwise,</v>

126
00:07:11.221 --> 00:07:15.750
but,
so you have no issue with trans people as people.
Just to be clear,

127
00:07:15.751 --> 00:07:20.670
this is purely about the science related to transitioning and hormone blockers

128
00:07:20.671 --> 00:07:24.270
and things of that nature of a certain age where they're doing it as young as,

129
00:07:24.271 --> 00:07:25.800
I think you write him at 14,
right?
Yeah.

130
00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:29.180
<v 2>Oh,
younger than that now.
Well,
yeah,
I mean,
if there's parental consent,</v>

131
00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:29.691
definitely.

132
00:07:29.691 --> 00:07:32.820
And I have to say for a transgender adults and I'd say even kids who reach

133
00:07:32.821 --> 00:07:36.950
puberty and still feel that way,
I think transitioning is,
is totally up to you.

134
00:07:36.951 --> 00:07:39.680
If that's what the path you decide to go,
then power to you.

135
00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:41.570
I don't think there's anyone,
any,

136
00:07:41.571 --> 00:07:44.150
it's anyone's business to tell you what to do at that point.

137
00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:47.890
<v 1>So what are their basic parameters related to age then?</v>

138
00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:51.350
<v 2>Well,
there are in terms of,
I don't work with children,</v>

139
00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:55.770
I don't do clinical work anymore.
But um,
in terms of the research literature,

140
00:07:56.160 --> 00:08:01.160
usually clinicians will wait until puberty and see how the child feels at that

141
00:08:01.381 --> 00:08:02.970
time when the body starts changing,

142
00:08:03.390 --> 00:08:05.940
when they start having crushes on their peers and that kind of thing.

143
00:08:06.030 --> 00:08:09.720
And the research does show that,
um,
when kids start to,
you know,

144
00:08:09.721 --> 00:08:14.721
have crushes and start dating and that can play a role in terms of how they feel

145
00:08:15.241 --> 00:08:17.220
about their bodies and whether they do outgrow it.

146
00:08:17.990 --> 00:08:21.570
<v 1>But just at that point,
your whole body is in flux,</v>

147
00:08:21.571 --> 00:08:25.430
your mental states and blocks your physical states in flux.
And as you said,
what,

148
00:08:25.431 --> 00:08:28.470
what did you say a percentage on that of how many of them turn out to just,

149
00:08:28.590 --> 00:08:31.260
they'd happen.
So yeah,
so they,

150
00:08:31.261 --> 00:08:35.820
so 60 to 90% of the children undergoing these feelings turn out to be gay.

151
00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:38.550
And then I assume the ones that don't transition,

152
00:08:38.551 --> 00:08:42.120
probably most of them ended up being okay with being gay,
I would imagine.

153
00:08:42.210 --> 00:08:42.950
Roughly.

154
00:08:42.950 --> 00:08:46.550
<v 2>Yeah.
And I was,
I would say even like I grew up in the gay community,</v>

155
00:08:46.570 --> 00:08:49.490
I have a lot of gay male friends and they've said to me when I was young,

156
00:08:49.850 --> 00:08:51.290
I told my parents all the time,

157
00:08:51.291 --> 00:08:54.920
I hate it being a boy and I want it to be a girl and I am a girl and why can't I

158
00:08:55.260 --> 00:09:00.090
a girl?
And now as a gay man,
I'm so comfortable,
I'm so happy.
And they say to me,

159
00:09:00.091 --> 00:09:00.560
you know,
I'm,

160
00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:03.300
I'm kind of glad I'm not growing up in this time cause I think I probably would

161
00:09:03.301 --> 00:09:04.170
have transitioned.

162
00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:05.420
<v 1>Yeah.
Well that's why the,</v>

163
00:09:05.421 --> 00:09:10.421
the sternal pressure seemed so crazy to me because you just don't know at that,

164
00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:14.980
at that age.
And even if you do know,
waiting a little bit isn't that,
uh,

165
00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:18.820
for the science to flesh out,
it's not good.
That's not going to kill you.

166
00:09:18.970 --> 00:09:21.070
It's just hard talking about this even,
you know.
Yeah.

167
00:09:21.310 --> 00:09:23.020
<v 2>Yeah.
I mean,
the thing is,</v>

168
00:09:23.050 --> 00:09:26.200
what people also aren't talking about is that for these kids sat in some cases

169
00:09:26.201 --> 00:09:29.350
the parents don't want a gay child and this is what upsets me the most.

170
00:09:29.590 --> 00:09:31.990
So if you have a little boy who is very feminine,

171
00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:34.570
he's likely going to grow up to be a gay man.

172
00:09:34.690 --> 00:09:38.920
But if you take that same Laboy and allow them to transition to female,

173
00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:41.200
when he grows up,
he's going to appear to be a straight woman.

174
00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:45.310
And so these parents are being lauded as progressive when really they're

175
00:09:45.311 --> 00:09:46.144
homophobic.

176
00:09:46.210 --> 00:09:48.370
<v 1>Oh God.
How perverse that is that,</v>

177
00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:51.790
that's interesting what you just said about a certain amount of gay men that

178
00:09:51.910 --> 00:09:52.750
grow up.
You know,

179
00:09:52.751 --> 00:09:56.020
they wanted to be a or felt more like a girl or whatever and then eventually

180
00:09:56.021 --> 00:09:59.500
Grad and we were okay because I never felt that.

181
00:09:59.501 --> 00:10:02.680
Like I played sports and I played video games and transformers,
all the,

182
00:10:02.710 --> 00:10:04.100
all the things that my friends did,

183
00:10:04.101 --> 00:10:07.370
or I never felt like I was a girl or more a feminine.
People always say to me,

184
00:10:07.430 --> 00:10:10.180
I don't seem gay.
And I'm always like,
I don't know what that,

185
00:10:10.181 --> 00:10:14.410
you know what I mean?
Like I'm married to a guy.
Yeah.
I mean,
that's pretty gay,

186
00:10:14.770 --> 00:10:16.220
but I never had that.
But that,

187
00:10:16.221 --> 00:10:20.170
that sort of just interesting about the psychology of gay people in general.

188
00:10:20.171 --> 00:10:24.250
There are gay people that grow up feeling very feminine or gay men that grow up

189
00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:25.450
not feeling that way.

190
00:10:25.451 --> 00:10:29.470
And I'm sure there's women that grow up feeling very butch or whatever.

191
00:10:29.471 --> 00:10:32.410
And there's women that grew up that are,
you know,
lipstick,

192
00:10:32.411 --> 00:10:36.670
lesbians and the whole thing.
Have you done any research on it,
on any of that?

193
00:10:36.810 --> 00:10:39.780
<v 2>Uh,
in terms of my research,
no.
But in terms of what studies have shown,</v>

194
00:10:39.781 --> 00:10:43.110
it is about hormone levels in utero.
So testosterone,

195
00:10:43.111 --> 00:10:45.660
if you are exposed to higher levels of testosterone in Utero,

196
00:10:45.661 --> 00:10:48.690
you're more likely to be male,
typical and masculine when you're born.

197
00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:50.220
So whether you're male or female.

198
00:10:50.460 --> 00:10:53.670
So most boys are exposed to high levels of testosterone.

199
00:10:53.790 --> 00:10:55.140
So that explains when they're born,

200
00:10:55.141 --> 00:10:59.340
why they are interested in male typical toys and activities.

201
00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:04.680
Um,
so for gay men they were likely exposed to lower levels of testosterone,

202
00:11:04.681 --> 00:11:07.770
which is why they are more feminine.
And the same with,
with girls,

203
00:11:07.771 --> 00:11:09.570
if they're exposed to higher levels of testosterone,

204
00:11:09.810 --> 00:11:11.490
then more likely to be masculine and lesbian.

205
00:11:11.770 --> 00:11:15.460
<v 1>Right.
Even though there's obvious outliers.
Oh yeah.
This is on average,</v>

206
00:11:15.461 --> 00:11:18.940
on average.
Yeah.
Is,
is there a danger in talking about that?

207
00:11:18.941 --> 00:11:22.330
Because I would imagine that the certain amount of people in the gay community

208
00:11:22.331 --> 00:11:27.100
that would want you to never go down that road because then you could end up in

209
00:11:27.101 --> 00:11:31.590
a place where,
oh,
we would be able to,
uh,
prevent people from being [inaudible].

210
00:11:31.690 --> 00:11:34.390
Ultimately,
if we can really figure out the science behind all this.

211
00:11:34.650 --> 00:11:37.170
<v 2>Definitely.
And I mean,
as a straight woman,
I have to say,
I even,</v>

212
00:11:37.171 --> 00:11:40.140
I am right now feel like maybe I shouldn't be saying these things because I'm

213
00:11:40.141 --> 00:11:44.130
not gay.
I can't speak for the gay community.
But as a former sex researcher,

214
00:11:44.131 --> 00:11:46.690
I am very much a proponent of,
uh,
yeah,

215
00:11:46.890 --> 00:11:50.370
<v 1>I'd rather you speak at this researcher that a gay person or a straight person</v>

216
00:11:50.371 --> 00:11:52.980
or anything else.
I mean this is,
this is the problem though.
You're,
you're,

217
00:11:52.990 --> 00:11:55.450
you know what I mean?
Like you're an expert that,

218
00:11:55.950 --> 00:11:59.230
and it's like even for you who's so brave on all of these issues,

219
00:11:59.590 --> 00:12:02.370
it gets weird to talk about an even for me,
I just,

220
00:12:02.420 --> 00:12:06.280
it's like a little weird to talk about it.
If she like a trader.
No,

221
00:12:06.281 --> 00:12:08.740
I am what I am and that's all that I am.
That's it.

222
00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:13.770
But like I know that just even talking about this just gets people crazy and I

223
00:12:13.811 --> 00:12:15.940
know what our,
what our Twitter feeds are going to look.

224
00:12:15.950 --> 00:12:17.660
<v 2>Gloria do this.
Yeah,
you can get ready.</v>

225
00:12:17.870 --> 00:12:22.870
So I mean it's crazy because even my colleagues who have the best intentions are

226
00:12:24.021 --> 00:12:27.260
doing this research because they just want to understand why our people the way

227
00:12:27.261 --> 00:12:30.470
they are.
It's not,
there are no nefarious intentions there,

228
00:12:30.471 --> 00:12:32.480
but people are so quick to jump on.
I mean,

229
00:12:32.481 --> 00:12:36.860
there was earlier this year there was a study about using AI to be able to

230
00:12:36.861 --> 00:12:40.490
detect whether someone is gay by looking at their face.
And so again,

231
00:12:40.491 --> 00:12:44.870
studies have shown that on average you can see differences between straight and

232
00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:48.350
gay people,
both men and women,
uh,
in terms of facial features.

233
00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:51.500
And so everyone's freaking out about this study and I'm thinking,

234
00:12:51.590 --> 00:12:54.860
why aren't we saying this is amazing that we are able to know this?

235
00:12:54.890 --> 00:12:57.770
And I mean I think I've really good Gaydar I've always thought I have.

236
00:12:57.950 --> 00:12:58.820
And now I think great.

237
00:12:58.850 --> 00:13:02.930
Like there's actually some quantitative data to suggest that I'm not just making

238
00:13:02.931 --> 00:13:03.510
things up

239
00:13:03.510 --> 00:13:05.670
<v 1>right.
And they're also,
they always say,
well,</v>

240
00:13:05.671 --> 00:13:09.900
gay guys have Gaydar that's something else that maybe you can see or whatever it

241
00:13:09.901 --> 00:13:11.850
is.
Or they'll there,
I don't know the people say it anymore,

242
00:13:11.851 --> 00:13:13.080
but people used to say gay face.

243
00:13:13.081 --> 00:13:16.980
Like there was just something about the facial features sometimes of gay men.

244
00:13:16.981 --> 00:13:19.950
Maybe they were a little softer or whatever it is.
I don't even know what it is.

245
00:13:20.310 --> 00:13:23.340
But like people were talking about that in the gay community.

246
00:13:23.341 --> 00:13:26.870
Then it comes out through some sort of science lens and it's like,
Ooh,

247
00:13:26.910 --> 00:13:28.110
we better watch out for that.

248
00:13:28.250 --> 00:13:29.990
<v 2>And the thing is then researchers see that and say,</v>

249
00:13:29.991 --> 00:13:31.220
well I don't want to go through that.

250
00:13:31.221 --> 00:13:33.080
So then they don't want to touch that topic.
So now there's,

251
00:13:33.081 --> 00:13:35.330
they're eventually going to be only like two different things you could probably

252
00:13:35.331 --> 00:13:37.760
study unless you know that what your findings,

253
00:13:37.910 --> 00:13:40.670
what you're going to find is going to be politically acceptable,

254
00:13:40.671 --> 00:13:43.130
in which case you shouldn't be doing the research because that means you're not

255
00:13:43.131 --> 00:13:43.964
actually doing science.

256
00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:44.830
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

257
00:13:44.830 --> 00:13:48.910
What do you think it is about you that makes you brave enough to do this sort of

258
00:13:48.911 --> 00:13:49.061
thing?

259
00:13:49.061 --> 00:13:51.430
Cause I've had a couple of other people we're going to talk about James De and a

260
00:13:51.431 --> 00:13:54.720
little bit because you've also written about him and,
and why,
uh,

261
00:13:54.830 --> 00:13:56.230
the whole thing about diversity and all that.

262
00:13:56.500 --> 00:14:00.430
But I've had a bunch of outliers in these communities on the show and I'm always

263
00:14:00.431 --> 00:14:05.110
curious what it is about the specific people that make them sort of put it out

264
00:14:05.111 --> 00:14:08.140
there and go,
I'm going to do it.
Whether you like it or not,

265
00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:10.580
<v 2>it's probably my personality.
Yeah,</v>

266
00:14:10.581 --> 00:14:13.070
I mean I just generally don't really care what people think about me.

267
00:14:14.540 --> 00:14:18.620
And I'm pretty stubborn and I've,
I'm very,

268
00:14:18.621 --> 00:14:23.420
I feel very strongly about sex research being taken seriously and my decision to

269
00:14:23.450 --> 00:14:26.510
go on it and gone into that field that you deal with a lot of stigma as I

270
00:14:26.511 --> 00:14:28.640
mentioned earlier,
you deal with it on both sides,
you know,

271
00:14:28.641 --> 00:14:31.730
and when you make the decision to go into the fields,

272
00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:35.780
suddenly when people know what you do,
they will judge you on a personal level.

273
00:14:35.781 --> 00:14:37.250
So I think that was part of it.
You know,

274
00:14:37.251 --> 00:14:40.940
I grew up very thick skin from saying I'm going to do what I find interesting

275
00:14:40.941 --> 00:14:43.820
and people can assume whatever they want about me.
And that,

276
00:14:43.821 --> 00:14:47.690
I think that just translated into now what I do as a,
as a science journalist.

277
00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:49.250
But the,
I would say too,

278
00:14:49.251 --> 00:14:52.670
and I'm sure you've probably went through a similar experience once you speak

279
00:14:52.671 --> 00:14:56.630
out,
it becomes a much easier and I find I can't,
I can't stay quiet now.

280
00:14:57.140 --> 00:15:00.110
And I find the people that are gonna,
you know,
turn their backs on,

281
00:15:00.111 --> 00:15:02.120
you let them because you don't need them in your life.

282
00:15:02.870 --> 00:15:07.100
<v 1>Yeah.
Once you start,
you just,
you can't stop.
Actually,
it's built into you.</v>

283
00:15:07.101 --> 00:15:11.090
You just can't stop.
So I,
one of the things I think is really interesting is how,

284
00:15:11.180 --> 00:15:11.751
you know,
there's,

285
00:15:11.751 --> 00:15:15.800
there's such a movement always to say that gay people are born this way.
Right.

286
00:15:15.801 --> 00:15:20.330
Lady Gaga,
I even wrote a song about it or in this way already.
Gaga.
Yeah.
Um,

287
00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:24.260
and yet at the same time,
if I know for a fact,

288
00:15:24.261 --> 00:15:28.400
like I have a friend who for many years was my lesbian friend,

289
00:15:28.401 --> 00:15:31.170
my one good lesbian friend,
and she was,
you know,

290
00:15:31.171 --> 00:15:35.470
dating girls all the time and all that.
Then about three years ago,
uh,

291
00:15:35.690 --> 00:15:39.260
we were sitting there and she told me that she met a guy and now she's been with

292
00:15:39.261 --> 00:15:44.080
this guy for about three or four years and they're getting married and she's

293
00:15:44.190 --> 00:15:47.030
identified as basically as bisexual now,
but she's only,

294
00:15:47.031 --> 00:15:50.150
she's exclusively been with a guy for about four years.

295
00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:55.360
But what I find interesting about it is that her lesbian friends have basically

296
00:15:55.971 --> 00:15:59.300
all turned on her,
and this is supposed to be,

297
00:15:59.310 --> 00:16:01.850
these are supposed to be the people of tolerance and we should accept your

298
00:16:01.851 --> 00:16:04.730
sexuality and all that,
but when it goes the other way,

299
00:16:04.731 --> 00:16:08.480
suddenly it becomes this other thing.
Have you,
have you seen that before?

300
00:16:08.481 --> 00:16:09.150
I suspect.
Yeah.

301
00:16:09.150 --> 00:16:10.710
<v 2>Do you high?
I can imagine that.</v>

302
00:16:10.711 --> 00:16:12.810
I'm guessing they probably think that she's sold out.

303
00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:14.820
They think she's a sellout or something.
Yeah.
Yeah.

304
00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:19.590
You're taking the easy road or something like that.
Like every insane Cliche,

305
00:16:19.650 --> 00:16:22.680
and I know her to be completely authentic and real.
How does,

306
00:16:22.681 --> 00:16:24.390
how has she dealt with it?
I'm curious.

307
00:16:24.930 --> 00:16:27.540
<v 1>It's been a while.
It's walking her up in a zillion other ways.</v>

308
00:16:27.541 --> 00:16:30.000
So for a lot of the other things that we talk about,

309
00:16:30.001 --> 00:16:33.870
about free speech and politics and freedom and all that,

310
00:16:34.050 --> 00:16:38.790
she's started to wake up to all of that.
She was a huge lefty,
progressive,

311
00:16:39.150 --> 00:16:43.590
and now she's basically a libertarian because she saw that authoritarian thing.

312
00:16:43.591 --> 00:16:47.310
Why do you guys want to control me?
Yeah.
The second I think differently.

313
00:16:47.311 --> 00:16:49.610
You guys want to control me.
So now she's like the

314
00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:52.840
<v 2>first of all my friends so to speak.
That's the thing.</v>

315
00:16:52.841 --> 00:16:55.660
I think all of us are eventually going to have a moment like that where you

316
00:16:55.661 --> 00:16:59.740
realize what you thought was the truth is not the truth.

317
00:16:59.741 --> 00:17:01.870
And there there's so many other things.

318
00:17:01.871 --> 00:17:04.270
It's like falling down that rabbit hole and real and you start to question

319
00:17:04.271 --> 00:17:07.390
everything then and it's really liberating.
But uh,
you know,

320
00:17:07.391 --> 00:17:09.970
in terms of sexuality,
that's,
I mean that's very common.
Women,

321
00:17:10.570 --> 00:17:13.120
female sexuality as much more fluid than men.

322
00:17:13.121 --> 00:17:16.600
So men tend to be very category specific.
If you're into women,

323
00:17:16.601 --> 00:17:19.780
you really like women,
you're not two guys.
If you're into guys,
do we like guys,

324
00:17:19.781 --> 00:17:23.050
you're not two women and then women tend to be a little bit more flexible.

325
00:17:23.410 --> 00:17:24.850
<v 1>It's like you find,
you know,</v>

326
00:17:24.851 --> 00:17:28.990
there are supposedly straight married men that on the DL or sleeping with other

327
00:17:28.991 --> 00:17:32.830
guys,
but I'm pretty sure there aren't many gay men that are in relationships are

328
00:17:32.831 --> 00:17:34.750
married that are sneaking out and sleeping with women.

329
00:17:34.860 --> 00:17:37.950
<v 2>No.
On the DL,
no.
Have you ever seen one of those who do your research?</v>

330
00:17:38.380 --> 00:17:41.500
I mean there's gotta be your score as bright as some,
uh,
you know,

331
00:17:41.530 --> 00:17:45.990
I think the first case I think is probably closet gays.
And then the second case,

332
00:17:46.050 --> 00:17:50.580
uh,
I have to think about if you were closeted

333
00:17:50.580 --> 00:17:52.680
<v 1>gay man would go,
I guess you might be sleeping.
Yeah.</v>

334
00:17:52.681 --> 00:17:55.590
I mean I did it like I slept with women as sort of like a,

335
00:17:56.310 --> 00:17:59.330
an overcompensation or I was trying,
it's not even over station.

336
00:17:59.370 --> 00:18:03.720
I was really trying,
I just thought I should try.
I tried and I tried.

337
00:18:03.770 --> 00:18:07.590
I tried and you know,
eventually I tried no more.

338
00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:10.070
<v 2>Yeah.
I think also for gay men when you come out,</v>

339
00:18:10.071 --> 00:18:15.071
it's such a big thing and I think to make that decision to come out is really

340
00:18:15.621 --> 00:18:19.670
committing to this.
As much as,
you know,
we don't like identity labels.

341
00:18:19.671 --> 00:18:20.710
It is an identity labels.

342
00:18:20.711 --> 00:18:24.680
So I would see it as being less common for someone who's gay to be sleeping with

343
00:18:24.681 --> 00:18:29.570
women on the side because he would have likely just stayed in that camp.

344
00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:31.130
Right.
That that would be my guess.

345
00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:32.770
<v 1>Yeah.
So,
okay,
so you mentioned that you,</v>

346
00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:37.570
you study a lot of this related to the brain and how a lot of this is sort of

347
00:18:37.571 --> 00:18:40.530
built into us and you studied this across or,
um,

348
00:18:41.330 --> 00:18:42.610
as fetishize the right word.

349
00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:46.920
<v 2>A paraphilia is,
yeah.
Yeah.
Fetish is a specific paraphilia but yeah.
Um,</v>

350
00:18:46.921 --> 00:18:49.640
across the board basically kinky people.
Yeah.
It's a,
wait,

351
00:18:49.641 --> 00:18:51.150
what's the definition of paraphilia then?

352
00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:55.620
Unusual sexual interest and how's that different than fetish?
Well,

353
00:18:55.621 --> 00:19:00.570
a fetish is a specific object or body part that you have a preference for.

354
00:19:00.820 --> 00:19:04.350
<v 1>Got It.
So,
uh,
so let's talk about a couple of those.
Okay.</v>

355
00:19:04.420 --> 00:19:06.640
<v 2>There are a lot of them.
Yeah.
So I always,</v>

356
00:19:06.700 --> 00:19:09.520
I tell people this and no one ever believes me,
but I'm actually very,

357
00:19:09.521 --> 00:19:12.970
very traditional vanilla,
not kinky.

358
00:19:14.010 --> 00:19:17.170
<v 1>I was going to ask you all about at the end,
the value itself,
but,
okay.</v>

359
00:19:17.290 --> 00:19:18.970
<v 2>Yeah.
But I mean,
I'm fine.</v>

360
00:19:18.971 --> 00:19:22.810
It's super fascinating and I guess it's my way of living vicariously,
you know?

361
00:19:23.140 --> 00:19:27.940
So in terms of different paraphilia is,
I mean,
there's a voyeurism,
so you know,

362
00:19:28.210 --> 00:19:33.010
known as peeping Tom,
um,
exhibitionism.
So people like to expose themselves,

363
00:19:33.340 --> 00:19:36.940
uh,
sadism and masochism,
which are different from BDSM.

364
00:19:37.230 --> 00:19:42.220
Bdsm is consensual,
masochism and sadism.
Masochism being,
wanting,

365
00:19:42.280 --> 00:19:45.850
wanting to be humiliated.
Sadism is one,
just your partner.
Be humiliated.

366
00:19:46.030 --> 00:19:49.300
Bdsm is very much about consent.
So it's not true.
Mastic is a Mercedes.

367
00:19:49.301 --> 00:19:50.740
And because,
uh,
partners,

368
00:19:50.741 --> 00:19:54.970
we'll negotiate beforehand and not do anything outside of particular boundaries

369
00:19:54.971 --> 00:19:58.810
and that kind of thing.
Uh,
what else is there?
Fraud or ISM.

370
00:19:58.811 --> 00:20:02.680
So it's when people like to rub up against unsuspecting people,
they're tons.

371
00:20:02.710 --> 00:20:03.543
I could go on forever.

372
00:20:04.060 --> 00:20:08.350
<v 1>Yeah.
And so how are these all connected to the same parts of the brain?</v>

373
00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:12.190
Is it the same minute mechanism that's working in the fetish itself is just

374
00:20:12.430 --> 00:20:13.270
manifested in yeah,

375
00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:17.560
<v 2>a different targets.
Yeah.
So with my research,
uh,
when I was still a researcher,</v>

376
00:20:17.890 --> 00:20:21.730
I've found that for men who are Kinky,
when they look at kinky pornography,

377
00:20:21.731 --> 00:20:26.680
the same brain network activates as when non kinky people are looking at regular

378
00:20:26.770 --> 00:20:27.970
or vanilla pornography.

379
00:20:27.971 --> 00:20:32.560
So it's adjust that paraphilias maybe akin to a sexual orientation.

380
00:20:32.561 --> 00:20:34.420
So that's not to say that's the same as being gay,

381
00:20:34.660 --> 00:20:37.630
but it's the same idea conceptually that it's someone's preference.

382
00:20:37.660 --> 00:20:41.740
It can't be changed.
Um,
and it's with them from,
from very early on.

383
00:20:41.890 --> 00:20:44.350
<v 1>Yeah.
How does the Internet play into all this?</v>

384
00:20:44.351 --> 00:20:49.351
Because I know you've written about a porn and things like that where now all of

385
00:20:49.601 --> 00:20:54.601
this stuff is so accessible where obviously he'd been 1520 years ago,

386
00:20:55.061 --> 00:20:56.280
it was a lot harder to get.

387
00:20:56.810 --> 00:20:57.590
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

388
00:20:57.590 --> 00:21:02.480
I think people are probably able to test out different things and go searching

389
00:21:02.481 --> 00:21:04.850
for things out of curiosity.
But if you really like something,

390
00:21:04.851 --> 00:21:07.850
I don't think it's because you happen to find it on the Internet.

391
00:21:08.120 --> 00:21:09.650
And with porn addiction in particular,

392
00:21:09.651 --> 00:21:11.840
there's no research to suggest that's a real thing,

393
00:21:11.870 --> 00:21:16.160
that excessive porn viewing is akin to an addiction.

394
00:21:16.161 --> 00:21:20.120
Usually if you talk to someone with problems with porn across the board,
it's,

395
00:21:20.121 --> 00:21:22.370
there's always some other reason why either they're anxious,

396
00:21:22.371 --> 00:21:24.680
they like to procrastinate when they don't like to procrastinate,

397
00:21:24.681 --> 00:21:27.380
but they use it as a way of procrastinating and avoiding other things.

398
00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:29.870
It's not that they're actually addicted to pornography.

399
00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:32.260
<v 1>Right.
So when you hear though that people will say,
well,</v>

400
00:21:32.261 --> 00:21:36.190
you're getting that dopamine.
Isn't that partly what being a dick you wouldn't,

401
00:21:36.191 --> 00:21:37.690
you become addicted to that.

402
00:21:38.140 --> 00:21:41.320
What my understanding the term addiction slightly incorrectly.

403
00:21:41.510 --> 00:21:45.640
<v 2>That's true.
Um,
but dopamine is released during the number of different things.</v>

404
00:21:45.641 --> 00:21:49.360
If you eat a nice piece of food that you like,
dopamine is released.
Um,

405
00:21:49.390 --> 00:21:51.280
if you see a nice picture of dopamine is released,

406
00:21:51.281 --> 00:21:54.160
I mean it's reward but it's responsible for a lot of different things.

407
00:21:54.161 --> 00:21:56.650
So I think that's one case of,

408
00:21:56.680 --> 00:22:00.640
I mean I do have some issue with science journalists watering things down and

409
00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:04.960
liking to take one finding or one study and kind of,
uh,
you know,

410
00:22:05.290 --> 00:22:08.170
representing it or misrepresenting it.
Um,

411
00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:11.050
so that's not really an accurate take on it,

412
00:22:11.051 --> 00:22:14.250
but I understand why people think that because dopamine has been seen as the,

413
00:22:14.251 --> 00:22:18.980
the addiction a neurotransmitter and then you see so much about porn,

414
00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:22.420
porn addiction,
sex addiction.
I'd say probably a year ago it was everywhere.

415
00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:24.730
Everyone was talking about porn addiction and sex addiction.
Even though they're,

416
00:22:24.731 --> 00:22:28.570
again,
there's no legitimate research to suggest you of those things are real.

417
00:22:28.860 --> 00:22:32.030
<v 1>Hmm.
So when you've studied all of these things,
what are,</v>

418
00:22:32.031 --> 00:22:36.590
what are you finding out about the brain as a neuroscientist and can anything be

419
00:22:36.591 --> 00:22:37.970
done for any of these things?

420
00:22:37.980 --> 00:22:41.630
If somebody was partaking in these things and either didn't want to or at least

421
00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:43.580
wanting to understand it or whatever else,

422
00:22:43.980 --> 00:22:48.420
<v 2>the biggest thing I would say is find a partner who accepts you for who you are</v>

423
00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:51.510
is whatever you're into.
Especially for men,
it's not going to change.

424
00:22:51.870 --> 00:22:54.290
And so the difference between someone who has

425
00:22:54.300 --> 00:22:58.200
<v 1>so meaning women's kinks or whatever will change with time where a man would be</v>

426
00:22:58.201 --> 00:22:59.034
less inclined to,

427
00:22:59.060 --> 00:23:01.940
<v 2>yeah.
The same with,
Eh,
you know,
in the same way with the sexual orientation,</v>

428
00:23:01.941 --> 00:23:04.160
women tend to be more flexible with their sexual preferences.

429
00:23:04.161 --> 00:23:06.620
So if they are Kinky,
they might be really kinky with one partner.

430
00:23:06.621 --> 00:23:07.850
Or if they have a partner who's very kinky,

431
00:23:07.851 --> 00:23:11.090
they might be into whatever he's into if it's a straight couple.
Um,

432
00:23:11.350 --> 00:23:12.920
but then if she's with someone who's less Kinky,

433
00:23:12.921 --> 00:23:14.750
it might not be as much of a problem.

434
00:23:14.751 --> 00:23:18.350
Whereas if it's a man who's really into something,
if his partner is not into it,

435
00:23:18.351 --> 00:23:20.750
he's always going to be into it.
He's just going to have to hide it.

436
00:23:21.420 --> 00:23:25.110
<v 1>Yeah.
Have you heard of this phrase,
lesbian bed,
death?
I'm all,</v>

437
00:23:25.111 --> 00:23:25.944
I'm all over the place.

438
00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:30.750
I'm just going into the volunteer could come up with,
yeah.

439
00:23:30.790 --> 00:23:31.980
Have you heard this phrase before?
Right.

440
00:23:32.020 --> 00:23:34.820
<v 2>It's means that there's no sex after a certain amount of time.
Yeah.</v>

441
00:23:34.890 --> 00:23:35.840
<v 1>Yeah.
That lesbians,</v>

442
00:23:35.841 --> 00:23:40.841
it sort of burns very hot for that early period and then the u haul shows up as

443
00:23:41.410 --> 00:23:46.400
a joke and then just like the,
the desire for sex just disappeared.

444
00:23:46.450 --> 00:23:50.190
<v 2>There's just lots of cuddling.
Yeah.
Yeah,
I have heard of that.
Well,</v>

445
00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:52.600
men on average do tend to have a higher sex drive,

446
00:23:52.601 --> 00:23:56.350
so I could see if you're in a relationship where it's two women,
how this,

447
00:23:56.410 --> 00:23:59.800
you know,
their sex drive might be a bit lower.
Not sure what else,

448
00:23:59.820 --> 00:24:01.450
<v 1>like it's not anything else on that.</v>

449
00:24:02.510 --> 00:24:06.240
What are you really thinking about right now?
Like in general,

450
00:24:06.241 --> 00:24:09.090
what are the topics that are really on your mind related to all this?

451
00:24:09.270 --> 00:24:13.140
<v 2>My concern,
number one is probably seeing how,
uh,</v>

452
00:24:13.230 --> 00:24:18.230
gender is being warped to facilitate particular political agendas.

453
00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:19.651
Um,
as you mentioned,

454
00:24:19.651 --> 00:24:23.480
the James Demora and seeing how that whole thing unfolded last summer.

455
00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:26.170
<v 1>Okay.
So let's talk about that.
Could you wrote a piece on it?</v>

456
00:24:26.171 --> 00:24:27.250
I remember the piece coming out.

457
00:24:27.750 --> 00:24:32.050
<v 2>Yeah.
Um,
so I remember when that news first broke,
uh,</v>

458
00:24:32.070 --> 00:24:36.300
that this sexist memo was going around and I read it and I thought,
okay,

459
00:24:36.301 --> 00:24:37.350
this is not sexist.

460
00:24:37.351 --> 00:24:40.620
And then I saw the statement from Google that he was perpetuating gender

461
00:24:40.621 --> 00:24:43.350
stereotypes and I thought,
oh no.

462
00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:46.740
And so I wrote that column for the Globe and Mail to speak to the science and

463
00:24:46.741 --> 00:24:51.450
say,
you know what,
the science that James cited was absolutely 100% legitimate.

464
00:24:51.900 --> 00:24:54.330
And there shouldn't be anything wrong with saying that.

465
00:24:54.450 --> 00:24:57.210
And if you actually read his memo,
you'll see that he's not a misogynist.

466
00:24:57.240 --> 00:25:00.750
And we actually saw the podcast that I cohost with Jonathan Kay called wrong

467
00:25:00.751 --> 00:25:01.320
speak.

468
00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:04.770
We actually interviewed him for our first episode and have you listened to him

469
00:25:04.771 --> 00:25:09.060
speak?
You'll,
you can see,
I mean he's very much for equality between the sexes.

470
00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:11.520
He says that of men and women don't talk to each other.

471
00:25:11.521 --> 00:25:13.470
That's going to harm both of us.
Um,

472
00:25:13.471 --> 00:25:17.090
but it was much easier for them to paint him as a misogynist and as uh,

473
00:25:17.190 --> 00:25:19.620
an outright figure.
Cause I guess,
you know,

474
00:25:19.621 --> 00:25:20.850
there's nothing else going on the news.

475
00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:24.890
<v 1>Did you feel that the article,</v>

476
00:25:25.550 --> 00:25:28.400
or at least when James was able to get out there and say what he thought,

477
00:25:28.401 --> 00:25:32.000
whether he did it here or,
or on Rogan or a series of other podcasts,

478
00:25:32.450 --> 00:25:35.810
did you feel that that was able to break through to some of the people that

479
00:25:35.811 --> 00:25:38.360
needed to break through to like,
I know it gets to the masses,
right?

480
00:25:38.361 --> 00:25:41.710
It gets to the people who appreciate maybe what happens in here or,

481
00:25:41.750 --> 00:25:43.280
or on Rogan or things like that.

482
00:25:43.460 --> 00:25:45.590
But for any of the people that really need to hear it,

483
00:25:45.591 --> 00:25:49.490
the ones that are at Google or the ones that are setting the diversity agenda at

484
00:25:49.491 --> 00:25:50.420
schools and all that,

485
00:25:50.660 --> 00:25:55.660
is there any sign that any of this push back against it has taken root?

486
00:25:57.060 --> 00:26:00.390
<v 2>No,
I think it's gotten worse,
if anything,
honestly,
which is terrible.
Um,</v>

487
00:26:00.391 --> 00:26:04.980
I think they are so set in that mindset that you really can't,

488
00:26:05.790 --> 00:26:09.060
you can't say anything.
I think reasonable people,
if you talk to them.

489
00:26:09.090 --> 00:26:12.090
I was surprised actually at that time because a lot of people that I knew that

490
00:26:12.091 --> 00:26:13.620
were really intelligent,

491
00:26:13.890 --> 00:26:18.000
really rational had bought into this narrative that he was a sexist person who

492
00:26:18.001 --> 00:26:23.001
said that women are biologically inferior and are not capable of engineering or

493
00:26:23.881 --> 00:26:27.120
working in tech.
And I said,
well,
how would you think that,
did you read the memo?

494
00:26:27.121 --> 00:26:28.540
And most people had not yet of course,

495
00:26:29.110 --> 00:26:33.900
but then because left wing media was so adamant about this message,

496
00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:37.410
people just assume,
well,
they're not going to lie.
Why would they lie?

497
00:26:37.950 --> 00:26:40.590
And you know,
we are in this industry,
so of course we know.

498
00:26:40.591 --> 00:26:42.900
But I think most people just take at face value.
They're,

499
00:26:43.350 --> 00:26:46.740
they have their jobs and so they see a headline or they see an interview.

500
00:26:46.741 --> 00:26:50.520
They just think,
well,
I like a mainstream interview.
They think,
well,

501
00:26:50.820 --> 00:26:54.270
they wouldn't be saying these things if there wasn't some truth to them.
But no,

502
00:26:54.280 --> 00:26:55.530
they're,
they're blatantly lying.

503
00:26:55.590 --> 00:27:00.060
<v 1>They're blatantly lying.
Has all of this and,
and being part of this and now,</v>

504
00:27:00.070 --> 00:27:01.980
you know,
being very public about your opinions,

505
00:27:01.981 --> 00:27:04.170
has this changed your politics at all?

506
00:27:04.860 --> 00:27:07.860
I find that it consistently has changed people's politics.

507
00:27:07.861 --> 00:27:11.610
Usually it shifts people to more of what I would say is a classical liberal

508
00:27:11.611 --> 00:27:13.230
position.
But what a libertarian,

509
00:27:13.231 --> 00:27:16.260
just more of a less government position because you want,

510
00:27:16.410 --> 00:27:20.940
because that's where I think of at the moment,
the most freedom lays.

511
00:27:21.090 --> 00:27:24.180
<v 2>Yeah,
I would agree with that.
And especially the idea of the government.</v>

512
00:27:24.181 --> 00:27:27.910
I used to,
I used to be definitely more left,
much,
much more left.
Um,

513
00:27:28.010 --> 00:27:31.650
I was still called myself a liberal,
but definitely now that I see,

514
00:27:31.980 --> 00:27:34.710
because I used to think was good for the government to come in and help people

515
00:27:34.711 --> 00:27:36.600
and to kind of set the tone.
But now,

516
00:27:36.900 --> 00:27:40.620
now I'm seeing things that are not hate speech or being considered hate speech

517
00:27:41.040 --> 00:27:43.830
and genuine facts.
We're not allowed to say them anymore.

518
00:27:43.860 --> 00:27:48.450
So I'm much more skeptical now of government intervention of policies dictating

519
00:27:48.451 --> 00:27:50.220
what people can and cannot do or say.

520
00:27:50.520 --> 00:27:52.440
So I would say I have moved more to the right,

521
00:27:52.441 --> 00:27:54.240
but I would still call myself a liberal.
And I mean,

522
00:27:54.241 --> 00:27:57.660
the fact that I write about sex research for a living is pretty low.

523
00:27:57.800 --> 00:28:00.770
<v 1>Yeah.
You're my kind of liberal.
So you're,
you're good to go in here.</v>
