00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.275
Today is a very big day for all
of you.

00:00:19.275 --> 00:00:24.000
Your first semester at MIT is
half over.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.646
And, in addition to that,
you have a lot of challenges

00:00:35.646 --> 00:00:41.185
remaining ahead of you for the
rest of this semester.

00:00:41.185 --> 00:00:47.470
I am going to help make the
chemical challenges fun for you.

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:52.371
That is what I am here to do.
I love chemistry.

00:00:52.371 --> 00:00:57.591
I love teaching 5.112.
This is the best part of my

00:00:57.591 --> 00:01:01.000
week.
So, here we are.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Do you guys know that chemistry
can be incredibly fun?

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Let me just show you how fun
chemistry can be.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.918
And that is just the gravy.
The fun part is actually making

00:01:29.918 --> 00:01:34.396
the molecules.
Any of you see this picture in

00:01:34.396 --> 00:01:37.000
U.S.A.
Today recently?

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.953
Not reading that important
journal, I see.

00:01:44.953 --> 00:01:48.699
Well, this picture did appear
very recently in U.S.A.

00:01:48.699 --> 00:01:52.949
Today in a story that talked
about the recent Nobel Prize in

00:01:52.949 --> 00:01:56.478
chemistry that was awarded to
Professor Richard R.

00:01:56.478 --> 00:01:59.880
Schrock, of our department.
And, in fact,

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.808
I don't know if you realize
this, but Professor Schrock was

00:02:03.808 --> 00:02:07.871
the first person ever awarded
the Nobel Prize in Chemistry at

00:02:07.871 --> 00:02:10.241
MIT for work conducted while at
MIT.

00:02:10.241 --> 00:02:13.898
That is a pretty amazing
accomplishment because we have

00:02:13.898 --> 00:02:17.081
so many tremendous chemists on
the faculty here,

00:02:17.081 --> 00:02:20.805
and he is the first one to
break through in that manner.

00:02:20.805 --> 00:02:23.853
And maybe you are here at a
very special time,

00:02:23.853 --> 00:02:29.000
and we will see a number more
of these in the next few years.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.104
May with you contributing,
so much the better because you

00:02:33.104 --> 00:02:35.449
are here.
And let me just explain

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:37.794
something, too.
Chemistry is fun.

00:02:37.794 --> 00:02:41.898
And only on very rare occasions
like this would Professor

00:02:41.898 --> 00:02:45.709
Schrock be drinking champagne at
8:30 in the morning,

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:49.300
when this picture was taken.
The Reuters reporter,

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:53.111
Brian, who took this photo,
is actually a pretty good

00:02:53.111 --> 00:02:57.508
friend of Professor Nocera here.
And so he rode over from the

00:02:57.508 --> 00:03:01.634
Schrock household.
And Dick and Dan came in

00:03:01.634 --> 00:03:04.493
together in the same car,
as they often do,

00:03:04.493 --> 00:03:07.761
from Winchester on that
morning, which was a very

00:03:07.761 --> 00:03:10.348
exciting day.
If you come to see me for

00:03:10.348 --> 00:03:14.297
office hours maybe I will tell
you more about it in detail,

00:03:14.297 --> 00:03:17.293
but it was an exciting day.
And I am in here,

00:03:17.293 --> 00:03:19.131
too.
My name is Kit Cummins.

00:03:19.131 --> 00:03:21.991
Kit is my nickname.
My name is Christopher.

00:03:21.991 --> 00:03:25.599
You can call me Christopher or
Kit, or you can call me

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:28.459
Professor Cummins,
or you can just say hey,

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:32.000
chemistry guy.
That will be fine.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.357
I am in this picture primarily
because it is part of being in

00:03:36.357 --> 00:03:40.715
the right place at the right
time, just like I am here now in

00:03:40.715 --> 00:03:43.837
front of you.
But also I am in it because we

00:03:43.837 --> 00:03:47.977
three are three in one of the
areas in our department that

00:03:47.977 --> 00:03:51.463
really focus our research on
inorganic chemistry.

00:03:51.463 --> 00:03:53.715
And what is inorganic
chemistry?

00:03:53.715 --> 00:03:58.000
I will say more about this
during the semester.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.007
But inorganic chemistry is
really the chemistry of the

00:04:02.007 --> 00:04:05.182
elements of the Periodic Table
inclusively.

00:04:05.182 --> 00:04:09.417
So, a pretty broad topic.
And I like doing chemistry with

00:04:09.417 --> 00:04:12.895
lots of elements.
And so that is why these guys

00:04:12.895 --> 00:04:16.070
and I share an association with
each other.

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:19.246
And, in fact,
I was a graduate student with

00:04:19.246 --> 00:04:21.665
Professor Schrock.
And I am very,

00:04:21.665 --> 00:04:24.160
very proud to be able to say
that.

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:29.000
Hopefully, my computer will be
staying on, here.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.612
And I want to point out,
too, that people who love

00:04:32.612 --> 00:04:36.152
science want to know something
about its history.

00:04:36.152 --> 00:04:40.428
And part of all of that is
knowing the academic family from

00:04:40.428 --> 00:04:43.894
which you derive,
depending on the person you've

00:04:43.894 --> 00:04:46.843
studied with in learning about
chemistry.

00:04:46.843 --> 00:04:50.603
And I studied with Schrock.
And Schrock studied with

00:04:50.603 --> 00:04:53.847
Osborn, a fantastic chemist in
his own right,

00:04:53.847 --> 00:04:56.944
no longer alive,
sadly, to see his progeny,

00:04:56.944 --> 00:05:01.000
Professor Schrock,
win the Nobel Prize.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.415
And Osborn studied with
Wilkinson, and Wilkinson was

00:05:04.415 --> 00:05:08.165
also a Nobel Prize winner.
So, you do not have to go very

00:05:08.165 --> 00:05:11.781
far back in that lineage to
encounter that recognition,

00:05:11.781 --> 00:05:14.727
the Nobel Prize,
Schrock, and then it skipped

00:05:14.727 --> 00:05:18.879
Osborne, and if you go back to
Wilkinson, there is another one.

00:05:18.879 --> 00:05:22.361
And you can keep going back.
And I am not going to go

00:05:22.361 --> 00:05:26.513
through that whole history today
because I have another history

00:05:26.513 --> 00:05:31.000
that I am going to need to go
through with you today.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:40.528
And I am going to bring this
back over so it does not

00:05:40.528 --> 00:05:48.225
distract you.
And this other history that I

00:05:48.225 --> 00:05:57.937
need to impart to you today has
to do with some of the

00:05:57.937 --> 00:06:06.000
contributions of Gilbert Newton
Lewis.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.958
This is one of the most famous
of all chemists ever.

00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:14.382
And if you like chemistry,
I encourage you to think of the

00:06:14.382 --> 00:06:18.805
word Newton, as it is found
engraved in one of the pillars

00:06:18.805 --> 00:06:23.385
in Killian Court at MIT as the
middle name of Gilbert Newton

00:06:23.385 --> 00:06:26.101
Lewis.
It is conceivable that having

00:06:26.101 --> 00:06:30.370
that middle name weighed heavily
upon Gilbert during his

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:34.275
lifetime.
But it remains a good moniker.

00:06:34.275 --> 00:06:37.082
And in the future,
when you have kids,

00:06:37.082 --> 00:06:41.103
I encourage you to consider
using it as a middle name.

00:06:41.103 --> 00:06:43.986
It worked well in this
particular case.

00:06:43.986 --> 00:06:48.234
When you get the notes for
today, which incidentally will

00:06:48.234 --> 00:06:51.648
be available on the website
after class today,

00:06:51.648 --> 00:06:56.199
so you don't need to write down
everything I am writing down.

00:06:56.199 --> 00:07:00.751
You are actually going to get a
little bit more in the online

00:07:00.751 --> 00:07:05.000
version than what I am writing
down here.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.420
And if you find that you forgot
something that I said during

00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:11.260
class, just email me.
I will tell you what I said.

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:14.101
It is not a problem.
But if you want to write down

00:07:14.101 --> 00:07:17.695
notes while I am speaking just
to make notes that you can refer

00:07:17.695 --> 00:07:20.304
to later to refresh your memory,
that is fine.

00:07:20.304 --> 00:07:23.434
I think your taking in
information in lots of different

00:07:23.434 --> 00:07:25.057
ways.
We are going to use the

00:07:25.057 --> 00:07:29.000
computer and we are going to use
the blackboard today.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.384
And you are going to have
available stuff from the

00:07:32.384 --> 00:07:34.594
Internet a little bit later,
too.

00:07:34.594 --> 00:07:37.978
And all of that is good.
I think you should try to

00:07:37.978 --> 00:07:42.192
reinforce and not worry if some
of the information is a little

00:07:42.192 --> 00:07:44.678
redundant.
And never be afraid to ask

00:07:44.678 --> 00:07:48.063
questions, especially,
I like to take questions by

00:07:48.063 --> 00:07:52.000
email or if you come knock on my
office door.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:58.699
In 1916, Gilbert Lewis
published a landmark paper in

00:07:58.699 --> 00:08:06.843
chemistry in the journal of the
American Chemical Society which

00:08:06.843 --> 00:08:14.855
remains the flagship journal of
the American Chemical Society.

00:08:14.855 --> 00:08:23.000
And this paper was entitled
"The Atom and the Molecule."

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:41.084
Besides being an incredibly
important and influential paper

00:08:41.084 --> 00:08:45.239
in the history of chemistry,
"The Atom and the Molecule" was

00:08:45.239 --> 00:08:47.000
also the basis for --

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.352
Like I said,
besides being a hugely

00:09:10.352 --> 00:09:13.813
influential manuscript,
"The Atom and the Molecule"

00:09:13.813 --> 00:09:17.342
also laid the foundations for
Lewis's thinking about

00:09:17.342 --> 00:09:21.564
electronic structure theory that
shaped the way we still today

00:09:21.564 --> 00:09:24.262
talk about valence and chemical
bonding.

00:09:24.262 --> 00:09:28.000
So, an incredibly important
paper from 1916.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.589
In the lecture notes today,
you will find the specific

00:09:31.589 --> 00:09:35.788
volume and page number for that
reference in the journal of the

00:09:35.788 --> 00:09:39.378
American Chemical Society.
And I encourage you in your

00:09:39.378 --> 00:09:42.087
copious free time to download
that paper.

00:09:42.087 --> 00:09:45.067
It is really great.
All the American Chemical

00:09:45.067 --> 00:09:48.589
Society journal articles are
available, from the very

00:09:48.589 --> 00:09:51.095
beginning.
And you can download it and

00:09:51.095 --> 00:09:52.992
read it.
And, having had this

00:09:52.992 --> 00:09:56.310
introduction today,
I think it will probably prove

00:09:56.310 --> 00:09:59.087
to be a very fascinating
exercise for you,

00:09:59.087 --> 00:10:04.670
if you choose to do so.
It also was the basis of a book

00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:09.840
that Gilbert Newton Lewis later
wrote on valance and on atoms

00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:13.200
and molecules.
That is also a classic in

00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:16.732
chemistry.
And, should you be shopping for

00:10:16.732 --> 00:10:21.815
chemistry books on e-bay or
something, you might find a rare

00:10:21.815 --> 00:10:25.433
copy of it.
And if you do and choose not to

00:10:25.433 --> 00:10:30.000
buy it, please alert me and I
will buy it.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:36.554
But Gilbert Newton Lewis,
"The Atom and the Molecule."

00:10:36.554 --> 00:10:43.233
In this paper you are going to
see, if you do choose to

00:10:43.233 --> 00:10:49.169
download it, that he was
thinking about polarity.

00:10:49.169 --> 00:10:56.342
And he was also thinking about
the relationship between the

00:10:56.342 --> 00:11:05.000
polarity of a molecule relates
to the polarity of a substance.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:09.303
And I mean, when I say a
polarity of a substance,

00:11:09.303 --> 00:11:14.503
that that would be a sample,
you could say a water molecule

00:11:14.503 --> 00:11:18.000
down here and liquid water up
here.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:28.318
And you will see this kind of
sigmoidal graph that Lewis made

00:11:28.318 --> 00:11:33.459
in thinking about how polar
condensed phase substances were

00:11:33.459 --> 00:11:38.777
as compared with the structure
of the molecules that comprise

00:11:38.777 --> 00:11:42.322
the substance.
Down here, in this region,

00:11:42.322 --> 00:11:47.640
you will find that there are
substances that are not terribly

00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:50.920
polar.
And what I have written here is

00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:54.909
the organic shorthand for the
hexane molecule.

00:11:54.909 --> 00:11:58.720
Liquid hexane is an alkane,
akin to methane,

00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:03.866
which is natural gas.
And so, if you are not familiar

00:12:03.866 --> 00:12:07.660
with this way of writing organic
molecules, I will just tell you

00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:11.514
briefly that this terminus is CH
three or a methyl group,

00:12:11.514 --> 00:12:13.742
and then it is CH two,
CH two, CH two,

00:12:13.742 --> 00:12:16.572
CH two, and then CH three,
another methyl group.

00:12:16.572 --> 00:12:20.005
So, that is some 
organic shorthand.

00:12:20.005 --> 00:12:23.558
And I will go through that kind
of shorthand occasionally so

00:12:23.558 --> 00:12:25.485
that you become familiar with
it.

00:12:25.485 --> 00:12:28.375
And that is the hexane
molecule, a very non-polar

00:12:28.375 --> 00:12:31.386
molecule composed of elements,
carbon and hydrogen,

00:12:31.386 --> 00:12:35.000
that have very similar
electronegativity.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:40.208
And then he goes on up the
curve here, and you find this

00:12:40.208 --> 00:12:44.280
familiar molecule,
benzene, considered next,

00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:49.772
as being somehow more polar
than hexane, and liquid benzene

00:12:49.772 --> 00:12:54.981
accordingly in its solvating
properties in the condensed

00:12:54.981 --> 00:13:00.000
phase, being a more polar
medium, as it were.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.191
And then, as we continue
progress up this scale,

00:13:04.191 --> 00:13:09.186
he writes next molecules like
the diethyl ether molecule.

00:13:09.186 --> 00:13:14.716
No doubt you are familiar with
ether and its applications as an

00:13:14.716 --> 00:13:18.194
anesthetic.
The first use of ether as an

00:13:18.194 --> 00:13:23.367
anesthesia in an operation in
medicine was carried out just

00:13:23.367 --> 00:13:28.451
across the river in Boston.
There is this historical Ether

00:13:28.451 --> 00:13:33.000
Dome there that you can go and
look at.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:37.076
But, nonetheless,
we are just getting up a little

00:13:37.076 --> 00:13:41.323
bit more polar than benzene.
And then next you find

00:13:41.323 --> 00:13:45.399
molecules like this one.
That contains an organic

00:13:45.399 --> 00:13:48.117
functional group called an
ester.

00:13:48.117 --> 00:13:52.449
That is ethyl acetate,
which is a substance that you

00:13:52.449 --> 00:13:56.101
might have smelled if you ever
built models,

00:13:56.101 --> 00:14:01.282
because some of the glues that
you may have used would contain

00:14:01.282 --> 00:14:06.696
it, or the paints.
And so, it is a system that,

00:14:06.696 --> 00:14:11.511
in terms of its molecular
structure, is more polar.

00:14:11.511 --> 00:14:15.651
And, when you use it in the
condensed phase,

00:14:15.651 --> 00:14:21.429
it behaves in a manner that you
would describe as more polar.

00:14:21.429 --> 00:14:25.955
And then, finally,
you get up to some very polar

00:14:25.955 --> 00:14:30.000
systems, like the water
molecule.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.526
Like the ammonia molecule.
And, finally,

00:14:33.526 --> 00:14:38.860
Lewis talks about a species
like this, which is sodium twice

00:14:38.860 --> 00:14:43.019
sulfur.
That is actually called sodium

00:14:43.019 --> 00:14:46.364
sulfide.
And it is a salt analogous to

00:14:46.364 --> 00:14:49.619
table salt, sodium chloride.

00:14:49.619 --> 00:14:53.506
And being a salt,
it is obviously very polar

00:14:53.506 --> 00:14:58.660
because there is quite a large
degree of charge separation

00:14:58.660 --> 00:15:03.000
between the atoms in the
molecule.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.930
And, accordingly,
if you take that salt and heat

00:15:05.930 --> 00:15:09.547
it up until you have got it as
hot as its melting point and

00:15:09.547 --> 00:15:11.729
make it liquid,
that molten salt has

00:15:11.729 --> 00:15:14.909
individually charged ions moving
around in solution.

00:15:14.909 --> 00:15:18.775
And that provides a very polar
medium, which would be excellent

00:15:18.775 --> 00:15:22.205
at dissolving polar things.
You will notice here that on

00:15:22.205 --> 00:15:25.697
the non-polar side we have
elements, carbon and hydrogen,

00:15:25.697 --> 00:15:30.000
that are very close to each
other in electronegativity.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.096
And then, as we examine this
relationship,

00:15:33.096 --> 00:15:37.022
we start putting in elements
like oxygen or nitrogen,

00:15:37.022 --> 00:15:41.478
which are very electronegative
close to the upper right-hand

00:15:41.478 --> 00:15:45.707
side of the Periodic Table.
That introduces polarity both

00:15:45.707 --> 00:15:49.407
in the molecule and in
substances comprised of the

00:15:49.407 --> 00:15:52.201
molecule.
And then all the way over to

00:15:52.201 --> 00:15:55.599
the involved atoms,
sodium and sulfur are very

00:15:55.599 --> 00:15:58.997
different in electronegativity
and, therefore,

00:15:58.997 --> 00:16:03.000
have very strongly separated
charges.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:08.799
And, in thinking about this,
Lewis proposed the notion of a

00:16:08.799 --> 00:16:12.399
continuum.
And his musing on this are

00:16:12.399 --> 00:16:18.500
really quite lucid in that 1916
paper, but the idea was that a

00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:22.299
molecule, or a part of a
molecule even,

00:16:22.299 --> 00:16:28.200
you can analyze molecules in
terms of smaller pieces of them

00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:33.100
that can be identified within
the larger molecule,

00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:38.500
can lie on either side of a
continuum in reference to a

00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:46.319
number of different properties.
And the section of class that

00:16:46.319 --> 00:16:53.072
we are launching into today
deals with acid-base properties.

00:16:53.072 --> 00:16:57.536
Let's mention that first,
acid and base.

00:16:57.536 --> 00:17:02.000
These are two ends of a
continuum.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:09.843
But he also recognized that you
could have a molecule that would

00:17:09.843 --> 00:17:15.321
be an oxidant.
And the counterpart to that is

00:17:15.321 --> 00:17:20.425
a reductant.
And then, here is a term that

00:17:20.425 --> 00:17:27.273
maybe those of you who have
studied organic chemistry in

00:17:27.273 --> 00:17:33.000
more detail than most would
recognize.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.000
This is electrophile.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:50.000
Electrophile has a counterpart
called a nucleophile.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:06.666
And then, the fourth one that I
would like to mention is

00:18:06.666 --> 00:18:08.000
acceptor.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.510
And, of course,
the counterpart to that is

00:18:15.510 --> 00:18:16.000
donor.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:25.938
Please remember those four
pairs because when you can

00:18:25.938 --> 00:18:31.921
understand and make predictions
about those four properties as a

00:18:31.921 --> 00:18:38.000
function of molecular structure,
then you will be a chemist.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:41.853
I mean that is a large part of
what it is all about,

00:18:41.853 --> 00:18:46.386
understanding all the different
chemical properties that will

00:18:46.386 --> 00:18:50.844
make it interested in terms of
acid-base, oxidant-reductant,

00:18:50.844 --> 00:18:55.000
electrophile-nucleophile,
and acceptor and donor.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:00.393
And the currency of chemistry
can be seen, with reference to

00:19:00.393 --> 00:19:05.329
this, to be the electron.
That is what chemistry is all

00:19:05.329 --> 00:19:08.437
about.
And so, we will be talking a

00:19:08.437 --> 00:19:13.191
lot about atoms and molecules
with reference to their

00:19:13.191 --> 00:19:17.761
properties and how the
properties stem from knowing

00:19:17.761 --> 00:19:21.875
something about the electrons in
the molecule.

00:19:21.875 --> 00:19:28.000
And I think you are going to
find this to be quite fun.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:38.320
With respect to the properties
of the medium,

00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:43.000
let's talk about a substance
like hydrogen chloride.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:53.038
This is just to illustrate what
I was saying over there.

00:19:53.038 --> 00:19:57.160
If you take a molecule like
hydrogen chloride,

00:19:57.160 --> 00:20:00.000
and it is a gas,
of course.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:04.618
And if you make a solution of
it in hexane,

00:20:04.618 --> 00:20:10.776
hexane is going to be our
solvent, and then what you find

00:20:10.776 --> 00:20:16.384
is that in this low polarity
medium hexane solution,

00:20:16.384 --> 00:20:21.333
liquid hexane,
the HCl molecule remains intact

00:20:21.333 --> 00:20:27.931
and floats around in solution,
interacting weakly with hexane

00:20:27.931 --> 00:20:34.891
molecules that surround it.
But if you take this HCl

00:20:34.891 --> 00:20:40.313
molecule and put it into a
solvent like water,

00:20:40.313 --> 00:20:47.301
then something on the other end
of the continuum transpires

00:20:47.301 --> 00:20:53.325
because we get ionization to
produce hydrogen ions.

00:20:53.325 --> 00:20:59.228
And they go off and are
separated in solution from

00:20:59.228 --> 00:21:04.160
chloride ions.
And we will talk more about

00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:09.039
just what is going on when you
separate H plus from Cl

00:21:09.039 --> 00:21:13.119
minus and let them
diffuse apart in aqueous

00:21:13.119 --> 00:21:15.119
solution.
But you can see,

00:21:15.119 --> 00:21:19.440
I think, the dichotomy.
Either the proton shares in the

00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:24.000
electrons of the chloride,
or it just pops off and ionizes

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:28.559
and goes out into solution.
And Lewis wanted to understand

00:21:28.559 --> 00:21:32.333
this.
And, to understand it,

00:21:32.333 --> 00:21:37.636
he developed a theory.
And his theory was the "cube

00:21:37.636 --> 00:21:42.621
theory." In this part we get to
draw some cubes.

00:21:42.621 --> 00:21:47.818
And he decided that if you
thought of the nucleus,

00:21:47.818 --> 00:21:53.757
which he calls the kernel,
of an atom as being located at

00:21:53.757 --> 00:21:59.378
the center of the system,
then if you had an atom like

00:21:59.378 --> 00:22:05.212
neon, which is a noble gas with
eight valance electrons,

00:22:05.212 --> 00:22:11.575
that these valance electrons
would want to get away from each

00:22:11.575 --> 00:22:19.000
other as far as possible because
they repel each other.

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:21.583
They are all negatively
charged.

00:22:21.583 --> 00:22:24.416
This could be,
here, the neon atom.

00:22:24.416 --> 00:22:28.416
Here, on that cube,
is how he would represent the

00:22:28.416 --> 00:22:33.583
electronic structure of the neon
atom, with the eight electrons

00:22:33.583 --> 00:22:37.000
here represented by
peach-colored circles,

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:42.276
each the vertex of a cube.
So, they got far away from each

00:22:42.276 --> 00:22:44.699
other.
And you can see that in the

00:22:44.699 --> 00:22:48.150
historical archives,
some of his original sketch

00:22:48.150 --> 00:22:52.555
books containing these ideas are
there, and now you will know

00:22:52.555 --> 00:22:55.933
what they mean.
You will see that he progressed

00:22:55.933 --> 00:23:01.000
beyond understanding the atom to
understanding the molecule.

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:07.000
And here is one of the
molecules that he talks about.

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:28.470
Here we have a molecule
containing 14 valance electrons,

00:23:28.470 --> 00:23:34.311
all arranged in that manner.
And this could be,

00:23:34.311 --> 00:23:39.192
for example,
the I two molecule.

00:23:39.192 --> 00:23:45.100
And let me draw it in terms of
a dot structure,

00:23:45.100 --> 00:23:46.000
--

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:55.727
-- like that.
And there was known at the

00:23:55.727 --> 00:24:01.272
time, partly because of the
contributions of Lewis himself,

00:24:01.272 --> 00:24:05.000
something called the Rule of
Eight.

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:10.536
And that was a reference to
this notion that most atoms want

00:24:10.536 --> 00:24:14.853
to have eight electrons in their
valance shell,

00:24:14.853 --> 00:24:20.296
and it is also something that
we call today the Octet Rule.

00:24:20.296 --> 00:24:25.645
So, when you see the Rule of
Eight mentioned in his paper,

00:24:25.645 --> 00:24:31.181
it is the familiar Octet Rule.
And you can see here that one

00:24:31.181 --> 00:24:37.000
of the key features is two
electrons shared equally.

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:40.678
And when electrons are shared
equally like that,

00:24:40.678 --> 00:24:45.060
you have a molecule with
symmetrical charge distribution,

00:24:45.060 --> 00:24:48.973
charge referring to the
electrons where they are in

00:24:48.973 --> 00:24:51.634
space.
And then, he showed that you

00:24:51.634 --> 00:24:55.000
could think about this another
way.

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:10.144
You could consider some kind of
a geometric distortion of the I

00:25:10.144 --> 00:25:12.633
two molecule, like this.

00:25:12.633 --> 00:25:17.611
Distorted, not only because of
my drawing, but because of the

00:25:17.611 --> 00:25:22.257
way the atoms themselves are
thought to be rearranging in

00:25:22.257 --> 00:25:24.000
this process.

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:39.617
Notice that what has happened
here is that the I two

00:25:39.617 --> 00:25:44.944
molecule is doing something
electronically such that one

00:25:44.944 --> 00:25:49.399
iodine is starting to pull away
from the other.

00:25:49.399 --> 00:25:55.210
This one over here is carrying
with it the electron that came

00:25:55.210 --> 00:25:58.406
from over here.
And, in that case,

00:25:58.406 --> 00:26:04.217
what we have is a molecule in
which we are developing partial

00:26:04.217 --> 00:26:08.963
negative charge on the
right-hand side and partial

00:26:08.963 --> 00:26:14.000
positive charge on the left-hand
side.

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:18.222
As I was talking up here,
I was thinking about what I was

00:26:18.222 --> 00:26:21.465
going to say here,
because the ideal is that

00:26:21.465 --> 00:26:25.839
molecules, even if they are
inherently non-polar like the I

00:26:25.839 --> 00:26:29.609
two molecule,
in their equilibrium structure

00:26:29.609 --> 00:26:33.154
they can have electron
fluctuations that lead to

00:26:33.154 --> 00:26:37.000
partial charges in the manner
shown here.

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:39.523
And Lewis was working
beautifully toward the

00:26:39.523 --> 00:26:42.633
development of a theory like
this that would allow the

00:26:42.633 --> 00:26:45.977
description of electronic
structure to be made graphically

00:26:45.977 --> 00:26:48.031
apparent.
And this is something that

00:26:48.031 --> 00:26:51.259
chemists really like to do,
is we like to be able to see

00:26:51.259 --> 00:26:53.430
stuff.
I hope I am going to be able to

00:26:53.430 --> 00:26:56.070
show you some really cool stuff
this semester.

00:26:56.070 --> 00:26:58.418
And, in fact,
even some really cool stuff

00:26:58.418 --> 00:27:03.547
before we finish here today.
So, that is the development of

00:27:03.547 --> 00:27:08.643
charge as represented using the
Lewis cube theory in an I two

00:27:08.643 --> 00:27:12.635
molecule.
Next, one thing you could do is

00:27:12.635 --> 00:27:17.391
say, let's just continue this
process, and the right-hand

00:27:17.391 --> 00:27:20.789
iodine with its eight electrons
pops off.

00:27:20.789 --> 00:27:25.969
That would give you an ionized
situation in which you had an I

00:27:25.969 --> 00:27:32.000
minus floating away from
an I plus molecule.

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:35.857
And that situation is drawn in
the notes, and because I am

00:27:35.857 --> 00:27:39.646
running out of space on this
board I am not going to draw

00:27:39.646 --> 00:27:42.421
that one up.
Instead I am going to go onto

00:27:42.421 --> 00:27:46.075
another triumph of the Lewis
cube theory, which was its

00:27:46.075 --> 00:27:50.000
ability to explain different
chemical bond orders.

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:05.222
By the way, Lewis never got the
Nobel Prize.

00:28:05.222 --> 00:28:08.670
He certainly should have.
A dramatic oversight.

00:28:08.670 --> 00:28:13.092
He was born in Massachusetts.
He was a Harvard professor for

00:28:13.092 --> 00:28:16.914
a while and did not like it,
and came to MIT to be a

00:28:16.914 --> 00:28:20.661
professor for a while.
And, although he liked that,

00:28:20.661 --> 00:28:23.734
that was not far enough away
from Harvard,

00:28:23.734 --> 00:28:27.706
so he went to Berkeley,
where he became the department

00:28:27.706 --> 00:28:31.978
head and was very successful
over a long period of time in

00:28:31.978 --> 00:28:37.000
learning about chemistry and in
teaching chemistry.

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:40.746
I will invite you,
and you will see this in the

00:28:40.746 --> 00:28:45.877
notes, too, to go ahead and see
if you can find a good biography

00:28:45.877 --> 00:28:49.054
of Lewis because it is very
instructive.

00:28:49.054 --> 00:28:53.371
Anyway, here is another
molecule considered by Lewis's

00:28:53.371 --> 00:28:55.000
cube theory.

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:05.683
How many electrons are being
shared by the two nuclei or

00:29:05.683 --> 00:29:09.506
atoms involved?
Four electrons shared.

00:29:09.506 --> 00:29:15.086
We can circle them here.
That is four electrons shared.

00:29:15.086 --> 00:29:18.806
Therefore, that is not a single
bond.

00:29:18.806 --> 00:29:23.973
We call that a double bond.
And so, that might be a

00:29:23.973 --> 00:29:27.073
representation of,
for example,

00:29:27.073 --> 00:29:32.940
the O two molecule.
Here we have I two,

00:29:32.940 --> 00:29:37.343
here we have distorted I two
with charges developing,

00:29:37.343 --> 00:29:41.223
and here we have O two.
O two is a very

00:29:41.223 --> 00:29:45.776
interesting diatomic molecule.
We are going to talk about that

00:29:45.776 --> 00:29:49.731
later in the semester,
but for now let's just leave it

00:29:49.731 --> 00:29:53.500
at that.
But then, even though this was

00:29:53.500 --> 00:29:57.000
quite a successful theory,
the cube theory,

00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:00.750
it has certain problems,
certain shortcomings,

00:30:00.750 --> 00:30:04.916
such as, we can do single bonds
with it quite well,

00:30:04.916 --> 00:30:09.166
and now we can do double bonds
with the cube theory,

00:30:09.166 --> 00:30:13.500
but what do you do if you have
to make a triple bond?

00:30:13.500 --> 00:30:18.250
That was a problem for Lewis.
That should be a problem for

00:30:18.250 --> 00:30:21.416
you, too.
Cubes just don't fit together

00:30:21.416 --> 00:30:24.333
that way.
They have edges and faces,

00:30:24.333 --> 00:30:29.000
and that is it.
And they have vertices.

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:33.013
You can do one vertex.
So, triple bond is a problem.

00:30:33.013 --> 00:30:37.106
And we know that there are
molecules that have triple

00:30:37.106 --> 00:30:39.939
bonds.
And we cannot handle them with

00:30:39.939 --> 00:30:43.245
the cube theory,
so we are going to have to

00:30:43.245 --> 00:30:46.787
something a little different,
for that reason.

00:30:46.787 --> 00:30:51.194
But there is also another
reason that had to do with just

00:30:51.194 --> 00:30:55.916
considering the chemistry of
light elements like hydrogen and

00:30:55.916 --> 00:30:58.199
helium.
Those elements tend to

00:30:58.199 --> 00:31:03.000
associate themselves with only
two electrons.

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:08.265
And so, Lewis decided,
well, maybe the rule of two is

00:31:08.265 --> 00:31:14.443
more fundamental than the rule
of eight, and that we should be

00:31:14.443 --> 00:31:18.594
thinking about pairs of
electrons somehow.

00:31:18.594 --> 00:31:24.063
Because he looked at what was
known about chemistry and

00:31:24.063 --> 00:31:29.936
realized that in most molecules,
the number of electrons is

00:31:29.936 --> 00:31:35.000
always even, is always divisible
by two.

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:39.793
That is something interesting
about two electrons at a time

00:31:39.793 --> 00:31:43.677
being important.
You take that together with the

00:31:43.677 --> 00:31:47.727
triple bond problem,
and Lewis started thinking in

00:31:47.727 --> 00:31:51.528
terms of electron pairs,
and this is where this

00:31:51.528 --> 00:31:55.000
"electron pair theory" comes
from.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:04.452
Although he spent a lot of time
on the cube theory,

00:32:04.452 --> 00:32:09.616
he was perfectly willing to
cast that theory aside in favor

00:32:09.616 --> 00:32:14.691
of something that maybe was
going to work a little better,

00:32:14.691 --> 00:32:18.965
the electron pair theory.
And how does that look?

00:32:18.965 --> 00:32:23.061
Well, of course,
his initial pictures still had

00:32:23.061 --> 00:32:28.315
the cube, which just shows that
once the human mind fixes on

00:32:28.315 --> 00:32:33.479
something, it fixes on it with
great tenacity and it can be

00:32:33.479 --> 00:32:39.000
hard to shake your way of
thinking about things.

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:42.295
But hopefully you will be able
to do that.

00:32:42.295 --> 00:32:45.912
He still decided,
let's arrange these electron

00:32:45.912 --> 00:32:50.815
pairs on a cube with the nucleus
of the atom supposed to be at

00:32:50.815 --> 00:32:54.593
the center, and let's keep these
electrons, now,

00:32:54.593 --> 00:32:58.933
nicely collected in pairs.
And let's get these pairs as

00:32:58.933 --> 00:33:03.515
far away from each other as
possible, for the same reasons

00:33:03.515 --> 00:33:08.177
we used to be putting eight
electrons as far away from each

00:33:08.177 --> 00:33:13.000
other as possible,
namely, electron repulsion.

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:17.290
Now, the problem of electron
repulsion between the pairs was

00:33:17.290 --> 00:33:20.854
not really solved.
And Lewis decided that the pair

00:33:20.854 --> 00:33:25.000
theory worked so well that he
was not going to worry about

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:27.909
that, and so we won't worry
about it yet,

00:33:27.909 --> 00:33:31.744
either.
You have your four pairs of

00:33:31.744 --> 00:33:37.740
electrons arranged at the center
of four of the edges of the

00:33:37.740 --> 00:33:43.127
cube, and that geometry is what
we call a tetrahedron,

00:33:43.127 --> 00:33:47.599
which I am drawing the edges of
here in pink.

00:33:47.599 --> 00:33:52.681
You have a tetrahedral
disposition of four pairs of

00:33:52.681 --> 00:33:55.426
electrons, now,
for an atom.

00:33:55.426 --> 00:34:00.000
This might again be the neon
atom.

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:11.941
But the nice thing about this
choice is that if you want to

00:34:11.941 --> 00:34:24.088
you can make single bonds with
this theory, and you can make

00:34:24.088 --> 00:34:28.000
double bonds --

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:39.044
-- with this theory,
like that.

00:34:39.044 --> 00:34:49.119
And then, due to the properties
of the tetrahedron,

00:34:49.119 --> 00:35:00.000
you can also make triple bonds.
This is marvelous.

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:05.123
You can see that the famous
chemist Gilbert Newton Lewis was

00:35:05.123 --> 00:35:09.031
talking about electronic
structure in terms of

00:35:09.031 --> 00:35:12.939
symmetrical things,
like tetrahedra and cubes,

00:35:12.939 --> 00:35:17.368
as a way of arranging electrons
reasonably in space.

00:35:17.368 --> 00:35:20.928
This could, again,
be our iodine molecule.

00:35:20.928 --> 00:35:24.836
This could be,
now, our O two molecule.

00:35:24.836 --> 00:35:29.265
And, if we continue that
progression in the Periodic

00:35:29.265 --> 00:35:35.520
Table, what is this molecule?
Dinitrogen, N two,

00:35:35.520 --> 00:35:41.267
the major component of our
atmosphere, another interesting

00:35:41.267 --> 00:35:47.719
molecule that we will be talking
about as the semester progresses

00:35:47.719 --> 00:35:51.046
forward.
But chemical language and

00:35:51.046 --> 00:35:57.196
electronic structure theory are
very much still permeated with

00:35:57.196 --> 00:36:03.446
this affection for symmetry and
the problems that you can solve

00:36:03.446 --> 00:36:10.000
using symmetry to analyze
electronic structure theory.

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:15.759
Let's talk next about another
molecule because we want to talk

00:36:15.759 --> 00:36:20.763
about Lewis's development of the
electron pair theory,

00:36:20.763 --> 00:36:26.334
but also we want to understand
how that relates to acid-base

00:36:26.334 --> 00:36:29.639
properties.
And so, let me draw here

00:36:29.639 --> 00:36:32.000
another molecule.

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:41.398
And when you look at this
molecule, which is the aluminum

00:36:41.398 --> 00:36:45.797
trichloride molecule,
in which I am drawing out

00:36:45.797 --> 00:36:50.274
explicitly all of the electrons,
not forgetting these two.

00:36:50.274 --> 00:36:54.909
And having drawn the aluminum
trichloride molecule

00:36:54.909 --> 00:36:59.151
and looked at it like that,
you can ask yourself is the

00:36:59.151 --> 00:37:03.000
number of electrons divisible by
eight?

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:06.786
Yes it is.
We have a 24 valance electron

00:37:06.786 --> 00:37:10.378
system here.
It is divisible by eight.

00:37:10.378 --> 00:37:14.067
Of course, it is also divisible
by two.

00:37:14.067 --> 00:37:18.145
You can also ask yourself is
this molecule,

00:37:18.145 --> 00:37:23.970
as written, one that satisfies
the rule of eight for all four

00:37:23.970 --> 00:37:25.524
of the atoms?
No.

00:37:25.524 --> 00:37:30.669
We have a problem there because
this thing is electron

00:37:30.669 --> 00:37:33.000
deficient.

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:45.932
And if you were Lewis,
you would want to know,

00:37:45.932 --> 00:37:50.737
well, if it is electron
deficient, this molecule must be

00:37:50.737 --> 00:37:54.932
doing something about that to
get more electrons.

00:37:54.932 --> 00:37:58.165
Which atom is missing
electrons, here?

00:37:58.165 --> 00:38:02.209
The aluminum.
How can we give aluminum more

00:38:02.209 --> 00:38:04.876
electrons, in a structure like
this?

00:38:04.876 --> 00:38:08.000
Can we get it up to the rule of
eight?

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:14.983
Double bonds,
awesome.

00:38:14.983 --> 00:38:18.383
Beautiful.
We can make a double bond.

00:38:18.383 --> 00:38:22.444
And, if we do that,
we can allow aluminum to

00:38:22.444 --> 00:38:27.638
satisfy the rule of eight,
or allow the rule of eight to

00:38:27.638 --> 00:38:33.169
satisfy aluminum.
Whichever way you want to look

00:38:33.169 --> 00:38:36.549
at it.
And see what we have done,

00:38:36.549 --> 00:38:39.612
here?
We have taken one of the

00:38:39.612 --> 00:38:42.676
electron pairs,
say, this one,

00:38:42.676 --> 00:38:49.119
and we have moved it in between
the aluminum and the chlorine,

00:38:49.119 --> 00:38:52.711
so it joins the other one in
there.

00:38:52.711 --> 00:38:57.992
And we get a double bond.
And now, everybody has an

00:38:57.992 --> 00:39:02.576
octet.
But what is the problem with

00:39:02.576 --> 00:39:05.705
that?
The problem with that is that

00:39:05.705 --> 00:39:08.650
chlorine is very
electronegative,

00:39:08.650 --> 00:39:13.435
and it does not want its
electrons stolen away by the

00:39:13.435 --> 00:39:16.748
very electropositive aluminum
center.

00:39:16.748 --> 00:39:21.901
There are other ways that
aluminum can ultimately satisfy

00:39:21.901 --> 00:39:27.147
its octet, and this is how we
get into the realm of "Lewis

00:39:27.147 --> 00:39:32.551
acid-base theory."
And I want to show you one of

00:39:32.551 --> 00:39:36.950
the other ways that aluminum can
satisfy its octet,

00:39:36.950 --> 00:39:41.788
and then, we are going to move
to the computer so we can

00:39:41.788 --> 00:39:44.780
visualize some of these
properties.

00:39:44.780 --> 00:39:49.354
If I put my aluminum here --
and do you remember this

00:39:49.354 --> 00:39:52.697
molecule up here,
the ammonia molecule?

00:39:52.697 --> 00:39:57.624
I am going to say that if I
draw that ammonia molecule in

00:39:57.624 --> 00:40:00.000
place, here --

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:10.083
The ammonia molecule comes in,
and it has its eight electrons.

00:40:10.083 --> 00:40:13.916
It is sharing six of them with
three hydrogens.

00:40:13.916 --> 00:40:18.666
The idea is that it has an
extra pair of electrons on that

00:40:18.666 --> 00:40:23.250
nitrogen in the ammonia
molecule, that it can share with

00:40:23.250 --> 00:40:26.250
the aluminum.
And now we go ahead and

00:40:26.250 --> 00:40:30.583
complete the picture.
And we can have eight electrons

00:40:30.583 --> 00:40:33.000
around everybody.

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:42.426
And so the rule of eight is now
satisfied for the three

00:40:42.426 --> 00:40:46.934
chlorines, for the aluminum,
and for the nitrogen of the

00:40:46.934 --> 00:40:50.868
ammonia molecule.
The ammonia molecule is what we

00:40:50.868 --> 00:40:53.000
call a "Lewis base."

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:03.391
And the aluminum trichloride
molecule is what we

00:41:03.391 --> 00:41:08.121
call a "Lewis acid,"
for reasons that should now be

00:41:08.121 --> 00:41:12.000
quite clear.
And I want to show you how we

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:17.202
can look at these things.
And if you will give me just a

00:41:17.202 --> 00:41:22.405
second here, I am going to load
the aluminum trichloride

00:41:22.405 --> 00:41:26.000
molecule up onto the screen.

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:38.059
What we are going to do is
remember that there are lots of

00:41:38.059 --> 00:41:42.585
different ways in which you can
visualize molecules.

00:41:42.585 --> 00:41:48.000
And I want to show you some of
the more interesting ways.

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:33.237
All that is is a picture of the
aluminum trichloride

00:42:33.237 --> 00:42:40.000
molecule with spheres drawn at
kind of arbitrary radii.

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:45.638
The size of these spheres is
not representative of any

00:42:45.638 --> 00:42:51.170
particular physical quantity,
but we can change that.

00:42:51.170 --> 00:42:56.914
And so now, what we are going
to do is draw the thing a

00:42:56.914 --> 00:43:02.866
slightly different way.
And what you can see is that

00:43:02.866 --> 00:43:07.986
the positions of those nuclei
are in this flat box.

00:43:07.986 --> 00:43:13.720
I made the box kind of flat.
It is kind of a slab because

00:43:13.720 --> 00:43:19.556
this AlCl three
molecule is conveniently kind of

00:43:19.556 --> 00:43:24.573
flat in its structure.
And what are we going to do

00:43:24.573 --> 00:43:28.054
now?
We are going to draw a contour

00:43:28.054 --> 00:43:31.287
surface.
And I like this.

00:43:31.287 --> 00:43:34.829
We are going to use the solid
surface method,

00:43:34.829 --> 00:43:37.324
first.
And can you see that now?

00:43:37.324 --> 00:43:41.831
These curves that enclose the
four nuclei of the aluminum

00:43:41.831 --> 00:43:45.936
trichloride molecule
do have some physical

00:43:45.936 --> 00:43:49.317
significance,
because what I have done here

00:43:49.317 --> 00:43:53.019
is taken results,
in this case from the quantum

00:43:53.019 --> 00:43:57.285
chemistry calculation,
but you could also take it from

00:43:57.285 --> 00:44:03.000
an X-ray crystallographic
structure determination study.

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:06.777
And I have drawn a
three-dimensional contour map.

00:44:06.777 --> 00:44:11.026
The value of the electron
density at every point on the

00:44:11.026 --> 00:44:14.960
surface of one of those ovaloid
shapes is the same.

00:44:14.960 --> 00:44:19.288
Just like when you have a
contour map to describe in two

00:44:19.288 --> 00:44:22.829
dimensions an interesting
complicated surface,

00:44:22.829 --> 00:44:27.000
we can do this in three
dimensions as well.

00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:30.581
And one of the things you
notice, when you look at a

00:44:30.581 --> 00:44:33.530
surface like this,
is that the value of the

00:44:33.530 --> 00:44:37.392
electron density actually goes
down to some low value in

00:44:37.392 --> 00:44:39.358
between the nuclei,
for this.

00:44:39.358 --> 00:44:43.150
When you see molecules
represented as balls and sticks,

00:44:43.150 --> 00:44:47.433
or if you represent molecules
this way, just showing a pair of

00:44:47.433 --> 00:44:51.716
dots between the aluminum and
chloride, you may not be getting

00:44:51.716 --> 00:44:56.000
a physically complete picture of
the situation.

00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:59.923
You can get a much more
complete picture if you have

00:44:59.923 --> 00:45:02.769
access to the actual electron
density.

00:45:02.769 --> 00:45:06.000
And then, you can even go a
little further,

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:09.230
and I want to show you
something very cool.

00:45:09.230 --> 00:45:14.000
First I am going to need to
load in a second molecule.

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:22.904
And that will be the product of
the first "Lewis acid-base

00:45:22.904 --> 00:45:25.095
reaction" that we have
discussed.

00:45:25.095 --> 00:45:29.136
Because, I didn't say it over
there, but that was your first

00:45:29.136 --> 00:45:33.178
exposure to a Lewis acid-base
reaction, in which the ammonia

00:45:33.178 --> 00:45:36.876
molecule comes in and binds to
the aluminum trichloride

00:45:36.876 --> 00:45:40.301
molecule,
in order to satisfy the valence

00:45:40.301 --> 00:45:44.000
requirements of the respective
atom types.

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:47.465
And so, here we are going to
look at that molecule,

00:45:47.465 --> 00:45:51.000
and we are going to look at its
electron density.

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:04.000
And I think you are going to
like this very much.

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:29.500
Here it comes.
And then I am going to

00:46:29.500 --> 00:46:33.000
represent this as a solid
surface.

00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:38.344
The value of the electron
density everywhere on this

00:46:38.344 --> 00:46:42.222
surface is 0.1 electron density
units.

00:46:42.222 --> 00:46:48.091
I want you to start thinking
about how that shape appears

00:46:48.091 --> 00:46:53.855
there because I am going to
underscore that a little bit

00:46:53.855 --> 00:46:59.636
more in just a second.
But one thing you should notice

00:46:59.636 --> 00:47:04.824
is that at the NH three
molecule, which is pictured at

00:47:04.824 --> 00:47:10.097
the top of that representation,
what you are seeing is that the

00:47:10.097 --> 00:47:15.115
value of the electron density
does not get very small as you

00:47:15.115 --> 00:47:19.793
go between the nitrogen and
hydrogen nuclei because both

00:47:19.793 --> 00:47:25.067
nitrogen and hydrogen are quite
similar in electronegativity as

00:47:25.067 --> 00:47:30.000
compared with the aluminum atom
in this system.

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:46.800
The fascinating thing about
illustrating a molecule in this

00:47:46.800 --> 00:47:55.599
way is that we can actually
associate another property with

00:47:55.599 --> 00:48:02.023
the color on the surface.
Now what we are doing is

00:48:02.023 --> 00:48:06.238
looking at the aluminum
trichloride ammonia system.

00:48:06.238 --> 00:48:10.791
And let me see if I can make
this thing gradually spin,

00:48:10.791 --> 00:48:15.259
so that I can talk about it
without being pinned to my

00:48:15.259 --> 00:48:18.548
computer.
What we have on the surface on

00:48:18.548 --> 00:48:23.775
each of these electron density
isosurface enclosed regions is a

00:48:23.775 --> 00:48:28.749
color that corresponds with a
value of a function that tells

00:48:28.749 --> 00:48:33.470
us about the propensity of
electrons to be paired at that

00:48:33.470 --> 00:48:38.413
point in space.
The Lewis theory is now colored

00:48:38.413 --> 00:48:42.694
onto the electron density
isosurface of this Lewis acid,

00:48:42.694 --> 00:48:47.209
Lewis base complex molecule.
And the values that correspond

00:48:47.209 --> 00:48:52.035
to those regions in space where
electrons are most likely to be

00:48:52.035 --> 00:48:54.526
found paired up are colored
blue.

00:48:54.526 --> 00:48:59.197
Where they are least likely to
be found paired up are colored

00:48:59.197 --> 00:49:02.000
kind of red-orange,
here.

00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:05.243
And then an intermediate color
is this green.

00:49:05.243 --> 00:49:09.518
And so, you can see that you
have electron pairs associated

00:49:09.518 --> 00:49:12.909
with each of the three NH bonds,
up at the top.

00:49:12.909 --> 00:49:16.078
You have another electron pair
here in blue,

00:49:16.078 --> 00:49:19.542
which is very proximate to this
aluminum center,

00:49:19.542 --> 00:49:24.113
that is very electron deficient
as we had found right over here

00:49:24.113 --> 00:49:27.724
because it lacks an octet.
And then, each of these

00:49:27.724 --> 00:49:32.000
chlorines is able to attract
electron pairs.

00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:34.849
Because chlorine is very
electronegative,

00:49:34.849 --> 00:49:39.195
it attracts the electron pairs
to itself and sort of withholds

00:49:39.195 --> 00:49:43.328
them from the aluminum center,
but yet, that development of

00:49:43.328 --> 00:49:47.104
charge separation keeps
everything together in what we

00:49:47.104 --> 00:49:51.307
can call an ionic interaction,
an electrostatic interaction.

00:49:51.307 --> 00:49:55.297
You can see here covalent
bonding, donor-acceptor complex

00:49:55.297 --> 00:50:00.000
formation, and electrostatic
contributions to bonding.

00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:03.942
And all of this is just an
illustration of the brilliant

00:50:03.942 --> 00:50:05.942
ideas of Gilbert Newton Lewis.
