00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
The smell of cinnamon and rotting cadavers...

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.920
Compounds that can remove nail polish, power a car, knock you unconscious, or make your headache go away.

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:13.240
All of these things can be accomplished by simple organic compounds with different functional groups sticking off of them!

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:16.980
Yes, I said functional groups! We will be
talking about them a lot today.

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.340
Now, when chemists started studying this stuff,

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:22.820
they didn't always know what really made one
chemical different from another.

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:26.640
Only that certain compounds, though different,
often behave similarly.

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.760
Some smelled like fish, some had relatively
high boiling points,

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.460
some reacted in similar ways with the same
compounds.

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:33.740
Now, however, we know better!

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.930
We know what they are, where they come from,
and why they act the way they do.

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.820
We are DEEP in the knowledge of organic chemistry's
most powerful tools!

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.400
It feels good in here!

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:48.920
So dive in, join me in this solution of ethers
and esters and aldehydes and amines and alcohols,

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.060
but, like, not literally because that would
be super gross and you would probably die.

00:00:53.060 --> 00:01:02.420
[Theme Music]

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:07.340
Thus far, we have only discussed organic compounds involving carbon and hydrogen and nothing else.

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.540
And yes, carbon and hydrogen are the backbone
of organic chemistry.

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:16.480
In fact, 1-, 2-, and 3-dimensional combinations of carbon atoms are the backbone of most organic compounds.

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:18.909
But today we're going to throw a couple of
newcomers into the mix,

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:22.169
two of my very favorites:
oxygen and nitrogen.

00:01:22.169 --> 00:01:27.349
Using these two extra elements, we're going to talk about seven exciting and different functional groups.

00:01:27.349 --> 00:01:32.300
But first, what is a functional group?
Sounds super boring.

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.350
Well organic chemistry is the architecture
of chemistry.

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:37.950
With it, we don't just study chemicals, we
build them.

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.830
And we know that certain groups of bonded
atoms function in very specific ways.

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:46.979
Since we know how these functional groups
function, we (and by we I mean the human race)

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.159
can add to or modify or remove and join them
together in predictable ways.

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:56.240
And thus, we can build the compounds we need, whether it be the simple stuff, like acetylsalicylic acid, aspirin,

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:01.400
or something more complicated, like alpha-(5,6-dimethylbenzimidazolyl)cobamidcyanide,

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.660
better known as vitamin B12.
Neat, right?

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:08.440
When we talk about functional groups, we get
so focused on those small areas of the molecule,

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.480
that the rest of the molecule doesn't actually
matter that much.

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.520
So we use "R" to represent the rest.

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:19.240
R just represents any fragment of organic molecule that we're not super concerned with at the moment.

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:22.580
We also sometimes call the area of unconcern
the "R group"

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:25.670
as opposed to the "functional group" where
the business is getting done.

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.110
So now that I've been talking at you for like,
three minutes,

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.790
let's actually look at what kind of trouble nitrogen and oxygen can get up to in an organic compound.

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:38.850
The first and most familiar oxygen-based functional
group is the alcohol, a terminal "-OH".

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:41.720
Not terminal in that it will kill you, though
ethanol can kill you,

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:47.260
and other alcohols like methanol absolutely WILL kill you, but terminal in that it ends a carbon chain.

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:51.020
Now, what happens when you dehydrogenate an
alcohol?

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:56.320
Not when an alcohol dehydrates you -- that would be a hangover -- but we dehydrogenate it.

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:01.140
In a chemical reaction, removing the hydrogen from the oxygen and creating a double bond to the carbon.

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:06.780
That dehydrogenated alcohol is an aldehyde,
literally from "alcohol dehydrogenated."

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:10.840
Alcohols and aldehydes have a lot of similar properties because of the electronegativity of the oxygen.

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.120
Hydrocarbons on their own are actually pretty
dang boring.

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:14.800
Checking out our electronegativity chart,

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:19.080
you can see that the difference in electronegativity
between C and H is only 0.35,

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:23.100
so there's no real regions of negative or
positive charges in the molecules.

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:25.860
Therefore, these simple hydrocarbons are pretty
nonpolar

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.790
and their electrons are distributed evenly
over the molecule, which is why, you know,

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:31.140
oil and water don't mix.

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:33.360
Adding those oxygens mixes stuff up.

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:37.760
Electrons start clumping, the oxygen-hydrogen
bond of an alcohol is fairly polar,

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:42.150
with a difference in electronegativity between
"O" and "H" of 1.22,

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:45.760
so the oxygen gets a delta minus (δ-) and
the hydrogen gets a delta plus (δ+).

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.850
Not only does this make alcohols and aldehydes
more likely to be soluble in water,

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:51.830
but it completely changes the kind of chemistry
you can do with them.

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:53.710
Impending confusion alert!

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:56.620
There can be functional groups inside of functional
groups.

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:58.000
We've already seen two of them.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.120
If an OH is part of a larger functional group,
we'll refer to it as a Hydroxyl,

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:06.140
and if a carbon double bonded to an oxygen it's part of a larger group, we call that a carbonyl.

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:13.440
For example if we have a carbonyl bonded to a Hydroxyl, that, my friends, is a Carboxylic Acid.

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:15.120
Hopefully you're getting the hang of the lingo.

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:19.040
Just looking at this Carboxylic Acid thing, if you think about the electronegativity of those two oxygens,

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:22.150
you can imagine that that hydrogen there is
gonna be pretty weakly held.

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:25.270
And so it can dissociate in solution, making
it an acid.

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:29.390
Carboxylic Acids are the acid part of amino
acids, which make up proteins,

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:31.720
which make up, you, so they're pretty important.

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:36.240
The simplest carboxylic acid, commonly known as Formic acid, is what makes fire ant bites burn,

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:39.560
and just one more carbon and you get Acetic
acid, or vinegar,

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:43.600
which, even in a diluted solution you have in your cupboard, is not something you want to get in your eyes.

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:46.120
Now, Acetic acid is also interesting because
once upon a time,

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:49.120
a clever chemist called Leopold Gmelin did
some chemistry

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:52.970
and knocked off the OH group and joined the
carbonyl with another carbon.

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:56.270
The result was a non-terminal, or internal,
carbonyl.

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:00.710
He named that stuff 'acetone', meaning basically
'derived from Acetic acid'.

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:04.100
Now, acetone is just a name of that one chemical,
not the functional group itself.

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:08.960
To get that, we knock the 'A' off and harden
that 'C' into a 'K' and get a 'Ketone'.

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:13.720
So yeah, when we have a carbonyl in the middle of a carbon chain, that is a ketone functional group.

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:17.900
Acetone has a ketone group and it's called 'acetone' because it was derived from acetic acid,

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:20.840
which is vinegar, the most common carboxylic
acid in your kitchen.

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:23.830
I swear, if you watch this episode twice,
you will understand.

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:30.040
Acetone, with that big hunk and double bond is nice and polar, so it's water soluble; great for cleaning stuff.

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:33.940
The hydrogen bonds between that oxygen and
those outer hydrogens are enough

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:37.540
to keep the molecules bound together so it's
not gaseous at room temperature.

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:39.780
It's also stable enough that it isn't very
toxic.

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:43.010
In fact, there's a little bit of acetone in
your blood right now,

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:45.710
which is why it's safe enough to use as nail
polish remover.

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:49.370
It is, however, unstable enough that you don't
want to get it near any open flames.

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:53.240
Now we only have two more oxygen-based functional
groups that we're gonna talk about,

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:57.250
These are groups that have internal oxygens
bonded directly to carbons.

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:00.870
When you see it now in the middle of the chain
like this it's either an ether or an ester,

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:06.050
either ester or ether, ether or ester, either
one, one or the other, either ether or ester.

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:09.500
Ethers have just one oxygen all alone in the
middle of that carbon chain.

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:13.199
Esters, on the other hand, I focus on that
'S' noise, making me think it must be plural,

00:06:13.199 --> 00:06:17.959
because they have two oxygens: one in the
middle of the chain and one as part of a carbonyl.

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:20.240
Esters are just like a ketone mixed with an
ether.

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:24.420
In fact, if you look at all these oxygen based functional groups you'll see that they're all very closely related.

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:29.480
Aldehydes are just dehydrogenated alcohols, ketones are just aldehydes bonded to R-groups on both sides

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:31.360
(instead of a hydrogen on one side).

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:35.350
While carboxylic acids are ketones bonded
to an OH group instead of an R group,

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:38.500
and ethers are just alcohols bonded to an
R-group instead of a hydrogen.

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:40.449
Now I did promise you some nitrogen at the
beginning,

00:06:40.449 --> 00:06:44.169
and I apologize to all of you die-hard nitrogen
fans for having given you none so far.

00:06:44.169 --> 00:06:48.840
Let's just say that the amine is ever so simple,
just a terminal NH2 group.

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:53.870
Remember, ammonia is NH3, so that "am" from
ammonia gets stuck onto that amine group.

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:59.320
Amines are super stinky: two of my favorites
are putrescine and cadaverine.

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:04.560
And yes, they are found in abundance in rotting carcasses of animals and yes, they smell super terrible.

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:07.220
And those are the seven functional groups
that we're going to talk about.

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:12.080
It was super fun, for me anyway, but I am,
I admit, kind of a huge dork.

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:15.860
Organic compounds that include these functional
groups have various wonderful names:

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:18.660
wood alcohol, cinnamaldehyde, and cadaverine.

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:24.540
It's lovely, right? Well chemists want more out of their names than wit and charm. They're too clever for that.

00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:29.580
Which is why, next week we'll be talking about
how to figure out how to name these compounds,

00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:33.140
and if we have the name, how to figure out
what the compounds are.

00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:35.580
Thanks for watching this week's episode of
Crash Course Chemistry.

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:39.920
If you were paying attention, you learned that alcohols are organic compounds with hydroxyl groups,

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:43.240
if you dehydrogenate them, the hydroxyl converts
to a carbonyl

00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:46.620
and they become dehydrogenated alcohols or
aldehydes.

00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:52.600
If a carbonyl bonds to a hydroxyl, the functional group becomes acidic and it becomes a carboxylic acid,

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:57.540
the most common of which is acetic acid, which if you switch the hydroxyl out for a methyl group,

00:07:57.540 --> 00:08:03.540
becomes acetone and if that 'C' were a 'K' noise, it'd be a ketone, which is what acetone is.

00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:07.060
Finally, a carbon chain with an internal oxygen
is either an ether or an ester,

00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:09.470
and it's only an ester if it's bonded to a
carbonyl.

00:08:09.470 --> 00:08:13.300
And of course, anything with an NH2 group
is an amine.

00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:17.740
