00:00:08.836 --> 00:00:10.816
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Three-sixty times two-

00:00:11.136 --> 00:00:14.306
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Public education
in America hasn't changed much

00:00:14.306 --> 00:00:18.056
since it began in the mid-19th
century with a curriculum adopted

00:00:18.156 --> 00:00:21.856
from Prussia that featured
reading, writing, and arithmetic,

00:00:21.856 --> 00:00:24.446
taught in separate
periods, ruled by the clock.

00:00:24.766 --> 00:00:26.266
&gt;&gt;Ken: In school subjects tend

00:00:26.266 --> 00:00:27.786
to be hermetically sealed
off from each other.

00:00:27.876 --> 00:00:29.556
You know so you do science
on a Thursday morning,

00:00:29.556 --> 00:00:30.966
you do math in the afternoons.

00:00:31.306 --> 00:00:34.066
And this is really a feature
of education because outside

00:00:34.066 --> 00:00:37.016
of education people know naturally
that all these things flow in and out

00:00:37.016 --> 00:00:38.746
of each other, you know, that
disciplines affect each other.

00:00:38.746 --> 00:00:41.346
&gt;&gt;Teacher: All these digital
photographs actually fill

00:00:41.346 --> 00:00:42.266
in the missing parts.

00:00:42.446 --> 00:00:44.986
&gt;&gt;David: We don't live in an
industrial economy anymore.

00:00:45.196 --> 00:00:47.826
We live in a knowledge economy so
we have to think about education

00:00:48.046 --> 00:00:49.316
in a fundamentally different way.

00:00:49.506 --> 00:00:50.466
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Look where
the water is falling.

00:00:50.776 --> 00:00:53.726
&gt;&gt;David: We can't be focusing
on basic facts and basic skills.

00:00:53.886 --> 00:00:56.006
We have to think about ways
of thinking that are going

00:00:56.066 --> 00:00:59.076
to matter more than what we do
in traditional schools right now.

00:00:59.366 --> 00:01:03.106
&gt;&gt;Teacher: You want to
be a photojournalist?

00:01:03.536 --> 00:01:04.976
&gt;&gt;Narrator: One successful approach

00:01:04.976 --> 00:01:09.636
to curriculum design is Integrated
Studies which blends various subjects

00:01:09.636 --> 00:01:11.746
and brings them into
meaningful association

00:01:11.746 --> 00:01:13.136
and often through projects.

00:01:13.326 --> 00:01:17.746
Integration provides students with
a depth and breadth of understanding

00:01:17.966 --> 00:01:20.996
that goes beyond individual
subject matter knowledge.

00:01:21.066 --> 00:01:22.976
&gt;&gt;Teacher: It's called the
circumference of the circle,

00:01:23.366 --> 00:01:25.266
so when you measure around this-

00:01:25.356 --> 00:01:28.196
&gt;&gt;Narrator: At Ferryway
School the Iron Works project

00:01:28.196 --> 00:01:31.946
which is a collaborative effort of
a dozen teachers integrates math-

00:01:31.946 --> 00:01:33.776
&gt;&gt;Earl: Maybe two millimeters.

00:01:34.026 --> 00:01:37.056
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Art, English,
history, and science.

00:01:37.356 --> 00:01:38.766
&gt;&gt;Man: What's this
simple machine right here?

00:01:39.076 --> 00:01:40.426
&gt;&gt;Student: Wheel and axle.

00:01:40.426 --> 00:01:41.216
&gt;&gt;Man: Wheel and axle, right.

00:01:41.246 --> 00:01:42.946
&gt;&gt;Earl: The project is not
just about the water wheel.

00:01:42.946 --> 00:01:44.726
It's not just about
the Saugus Iron Works.

00:01:44.996 --> 00:01:48.576
It's about all of the subject areas
being brought together: the rocks

00:01:48.576 --> 00:01:52.706
and minerals, the simple
machines, the technology concepts.

00:01:53.046 --> 00:01:56.346
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Brain research supports
the notion that learning increases

00:01:56.346 --> 00:01:59.926
when information is presented in
meaningful connected patterns.

00:02:00.256 --> 00:02:01.966
&gt;&gt;Anxhela: It looks like shiny metal.

00:02:02.306 --> 00:02:05.246
&gt;&gt;If you're like in different
classes you sometimes forget

00:02:05.246 --> 00:02:08.286
because your mind is on
one class and then you have

00:02:08.336 --> 00:02:10.416
to be focused on another class.

00:02:10.576 --> 00:02:13.496
But when it's all together you
could just focus on one thing

00:02:13.646 --> 00:02:14.676
because it's all the same.

00:02:16.016 --> 00:02:18.946
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Success in integrated
studies requires flexibility

00:02:18.946 --> 00:02:21.846
and scheduling and
collaboration among teachers.

00:02:22.236 --> 00:02:27.406
Studies show that benefits include a
sense of teamwork, a faster retrieval

00:02:27.406 --> 00:02:31.416
of information, and higher
attendance and homework completion.

00:02:31.416 --> 00:02:32.226
&gt;&gt;Earl: Here we go!

00:02:32.466 --> 00:02:35.686
&gt;&gt;Tom: You know, often you don't
have the chance to show kids

00:02:35.876 --> 00:02:38.996
that education is real, that there's
value to it and they get a chance

00:02:38.996 --> 00:02:41.846
to put that all together and
it's just wonderful seeing their

00:02:41.846 --> 00:02:43.486
enthusiasm, and the teachers too.

00:02:43.486 --> 00:02:47.806
It's not easy, but we know what the
benefits are so that's why we do it.

00:02:49.356 --> 00:02:54.596
&gt;&gt;Earl: We have a lift [cheering]!

00:02:54.726 --> 00:02:56.686
