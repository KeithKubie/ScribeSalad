- Guys, don't judge him.

00:00:06.406 --> 00:00:08.574
He's happy with who he is.

00:00:08.574 --> 00:00:10.843
We just legalized gay marriage
in this country.

00:00:10.843 --> 00:00:13.713
Don't take a step back
on dog homosexuality.

I'm your host, Ari Shaffir.

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.290
And today the topic is crime.

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:59.092

<i> [cheers and applause]</i>

00:01:04.163 --> 00:01:05.832
Here's the deal:
I moved to New York

00:01:05.832 --> 00:01:07.634
not too long ago,
a few years ago.

00:01:07.634 --> 00:01:09.168
And it's great.
It's a lot of fun.

00:01:09.168 --> 00:01:10.837
People are like,
"Which one do you like better?"

00:01:10.837 --> 00:01:12.338
I'm like,
"They're fuckin' both--

00:01:12.338 --> 00:01:14.074
they're both great;
they're both great."

00:01:14.074 --> 00:01:15.842
There's this war going on
between LA and New York,

00:01:15.842 --> 00:01:17.443
and I don't understand it.

00:01:17.443 --> 00:01:18.844
Like, "Which one's better?
Which one's better?"

00:01:18.844 --> 00:01:20.346
"New York sucks."
"LA sucks."

00:01:20.346 --> 00:01:22.348
I'm like,
"Fuckin' Kansas City sucks."

00:01:22.348 --> 00:01:23.650
[laughter]

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:26.252
Why are you trying
to hurt each other?

00:01:26.252 --> 00:01:28.954
It's like, who's better,
Kobe Bryant or Kevin Durant?

00:01:28.954 --> 00:01:30.523
Well, in terms of non-rape,

00:01:30.523 --> 00:01:32.125
I guess it would be
Kevin Durant.

00:01:32.125 --> 00:01:33.259
[laughter]

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:35.528
But--that's right,
I hate the Lakers.

00:01:35.528 --> 00:01:37.129
[laughter]

00:01:37.129 --> 00:01:38.865
People are like,
"Why won't you forget it?"

00:01:38.865 --> 00:01:42.134
I'll never forget it.
I'll never forget it.

00:01:42.134 --> 00:01:45.438
Anyway, that's all sidetrack.

00:01:45.438 --> 00:01:48.140
When I really like LA better
is in the winter.

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:49.842
So what I do is,
I find some comedian

00:01:49.842 --> 00:01:51.811
to switch apartments with
for the winter.

00:01:51.811 --> 00:01:53.379
I come here; they go there.

00:01:53.379 --> 00:01:54.513
I ask them usually in June.

00:01:54.513 --> 00:01:56.015
They look at the weather report,

00:01:56.015 --> 00:01:58.117
and they're like,
"Yeah, New York seems fine."

00:01:58.117 --> 00:02:01.220
[laughter]

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:02.955
And then, like,
January rolls around.

00:02:02.955 --> 00:02:04.490
They're like,
"You double-crossed me!"

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:06.692
And I'm like, "I can't hear you
over the sunshine."

00:02:06.692 --> 00:02:08.394
[laughter]

00:02:08.394 --> 00:02:10.896
So I switched apartments
with my friend Benji Aflalo.

00:02:10.896 --> 00:02:12.965
And he double-crossed me too,

00:02:12.965 --> 00:02:14.333
because when I got
to his apartment,

00:02:14.333 --> 00:02:15.735
he was like, "Oh, by the way,
I got a dog.

00:02:15.735 --> 00:02:16.969
You got to take care of it.
Bye."

00:02:16.969 --> 00:02:20.006
[laughter]
And then he left.

00:02:20.006 --> 00:02:23.242
This dog bit me for, like,
the first week I was there too.

00:02:23.242 --> 00:02:25.177
I was like,
"Why is your dog biting me?"

00:02:25.177 --> 00:02:26.846
He was--he stayed for,
like, three days.

00:02:26.846 --> 00:02:27.980
We stayed, like, together.

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:29.314
And then he left.

00:02:29.314 --> 00:02:30.716
But I was like,
"Why is your dog biting me?"

00:02:30.716 --> 00:02:31.884
He's like, "Well, you know,

00:02:31.884 --> 00:02:33.419
dogs can smell fear."

00:02:33.419 --> 00:02:34.888
[laughter]

00:02:34.888 --> 00:02:36.923
And I was like, "Yeah,
but why is he biting me?"

00:02:36.923 --> 00:02:38.857
He's like, "Well, you know,
when they smell fear"--

00:02:38.857 --> 00:02:40.592
I've never understood
that logic of, like,

00:02:40.592 --> 00:02:43.495
just 'cause you know
I'm scared of you, dog,

00:02:43.495 --> 00:02:46.532
why is physical violence
your answer to that?

00:02:46.532 --> 00:02:49.035
That's asshole logic.

00:02:49.035 --> 00:02:50.903
Like, how about
you know I'm scared.

00:02:50.903 --> 00:02:52.772
Walk slowly
when I'm in the room.

00:02:52.772 --> 00:02:54.273
[laughter]
Set me at ease.

00:02:54.273 --> 00:02:56.676
Don't be like, "Scared?
Fuckin' scared?"

00:02:56.676 --> 00:02:59.044
Like, "Yes,
please stop doing that,

00:02:59.044 --> 00:03:00.880
and I won't be
as frightened of you."

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.550
[laughter]

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:06.619
It was fun taking care
of this dog too, though.

00:03:06.619 --> 00:03:07.853
I fell in love with him.

00:03:07.853 --> 00:03:09.288
I fell in love with him.
I love this dog.

00:03:09.288 --> 00:03:10.789
'Cause a lot of you
don't understand.

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:12.024
My thought was,
"I'll take him on walks;

00:03:12.024 --> 00:03:13.359
I'll meet chicks,"
you know.

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:14.693
Like, "Oh, you got a dog.
I got a dog."

00:03:14.693 --> 00:03:17.363
[mumbling]
You know.

00:03:17.363 --> 00:03:19.732
That's a "one thing leads
to another" situation.

00:03:19.732 --> 00:03:22.268
[laughter]
I love this dog.

00:03:22.268 --> 00:03:23.870
Here's my question
about dogs, by the way.

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:24.903
They say they're supposed
to have

00:03:24.903 --> 00:03:26.238
a really good sense of smell.

00:03:26.238 --> 00:03:27.607
We've heard that
since we were little.

00:03:27.607 --> 00:03:28.641
Dogs--really good
sense of smell.

00:03:28.641 --> 00:03:30.276
Okay, well then how come,

00:03:30.276 --> 00:03:33.112
when they're smelling
another dog's asshole,

00:03:33.112 --> 00:03:37.083
do they have to be inside
that dog's asshole

00:03:37.083 --> 00:03:39.651
in order to make out
what it is?

00:03:39.651 --> 00:03:40.820
'Cause that doesn't seem like

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:42.889
a very good sense of smell
at all.

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:45.658
[laughter]

00:03:45.658 --> 00:03:47.793
I have guy friends
who if they haven't showered

00:03:47.793 --> 00:03:49.094
for, like, a day and a half,

00:03:49.094 --> 00:03:50.563
I can smell their assholes...

00:03:50.563 --> 00:03:52.265
[laughter]

00:03:52.265 --> 00:03:54.233
From, like, six feet away
through clothing.

00:03:54.233 --> 00:03:55.934
I'm like, "It was one
of you guys.

00:03:55.934 --> 00:03:58.271
I don't know which one, but I
can clearly smell asshole."

00:03:58.271 --> 00:04:00.740
I don't have to treat it
like a 40-year-old wine

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:02.174
where I'm like,
"Hold on, let me--

00:04:02.174 --> 00:04:03.809
let me really get in there."

00:04:03.809 --> 00:04:04.911
[mumbles]

00:04:04.911 --> 00:04:06.479
[inhales deeply]

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:07.780
[laughter]

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:09.748
"Yup, that's an asshole,
all right.

00:04:09.748 --> 00:04:11.417
Story checks out."

00:04:11.417 --> 00:04:12.685
[laughter]

00:04:12.685 --> 00:04:14.453
"Same place as the others."

00:04:14.453 --> 00:04:17.123
[laughter]

00:04:17.123 --> 00:04:19.258
Anyway, this dog,
he was so cool.

00:04:19.258 --> 00:04:21.127
Who has dogs here, anybody?

00:04:21.127 --> 00:04:22.795
[people cheer]
You guys got a dog.

00:04:22.795 --> 00:04:24.797
Your dog do any tricks?

00:04:24.797 --> 00:04:26.365
- Sleeps a lot.
- Sleeps a lot?

00:04:26.365 --> 00:04:28.467
That's not really a trick.
That's depression.

00:04:28.467 --> 00:04:31.304
[laughter]

00:04:31.304 --> 00:04:32.705
You want your dogs
to do tricks.

00:04:32.705 --> 00:04:34.140
Nothing crazy,
nothing crazy.

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:35.674
All I wanted to teach
this dog was to fetch.

00:04:35.674 --> 00:04:37.009
That was my goal.

00:04:37.009 --> 00:04:38.644
It was, like,
nine-, ten-month-old dog,

00:04:38.644 --> 00:04:40.480
and I'm like, "I can still
teach it," you know?

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:42.615
Fetch: basic shit.
Nothing crazy.

00:04:42.615 --> 00:04:44.150
Some people do that trick
where you put

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:45.652
a treat on the dog's nose

00:04:45.652 --> 00:04:47.319
and they got to fuckin'
sit there and not eat it,

00:04:47.319 --> 00:04:48.821
just balancing it,
and then you're like,

00:04:48.821 --> 00:04:49.989
"Okay, go,"
and then they eat it.

00:04:49.989 --> 00:04:51.057
That's fuckin' slave shit.

00:04:51.057 --> 00:04:52.725
Don't do that to your dog.

00:04:52.725 --> 00:04:53.960
That's part of your family.

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:55.794
That's unnecessary.

00:04:55.794 --> 00:04:57.163
Oh, this thing that you love--

00:04:57.163 --> 00:04:58.664
here, it's right
next to your face

00:04:58.664 --> 00:04:59.666
where you can smell it.

00:04:59.666 --> 00:05:01.500
Don't eat it.

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:04.170
[laughter]

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:05.838
I just wanted
this dog to fetch.

00:05:05.838 --> 00:05:07.874
That's all I wanted him
to do: fetch.

00:05:07.874 --> 00:05:09.341
Easiest shit
in the world, right?

00:05:09.341 --> 00:05:10.910
And I tried--I tried
to teach him how to fetch.

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:12.378
It was so hard, but I tried.

00:05:12.378 --> 00:05:14.380
I watched YouTube videos
on how to train a dog to--

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:16.582
I watched 30 seconds
of one YouTube video

00:05:16.582 --> 00:05:18.184
on how to train
a dog to fetch.

00:05:18.184 --> 00:05:19.885
I bought the crinkly
kind of toy.

00:05:19.885 --> 00:05:21.520
I bought those little,
tiny tennis balls

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:23.923
so he can get his fucking
tiny Chihuahua mouth around it.

00:05:23.923 --> 00:05:25.991
[laughter]
Nothing worked.

00:05:25.991 --> 00:05:27.693
He had no interest in fetching.

00:05:27.693 --> 00:05:29.995
You know what he loved?

00:05:29.995 --> 00:05:31.664
[people murmuring]

00:05:31.664 --> 00:05:33.533
Nope, none of you guys got it.
You're never gonna get it.

00:05:33.533 --> 00:05:34.867
You're not even
on the right path.

00:05:34.867 --> 00:05:36.569
Semen, semen.
He loved semen.

00:05:36.569 --> 00:05:39.539
[laughter]

00:05:41.908 --> 00:05:43.443
I'm not done there.

00:05:43.443 --> 00:05:44.910
I'm not gonna just leave it
out there like that

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:46.411
and be like, "All right,
next story."

00:05:46.411 --> 00:05:48.414
There's more to it.
I'm gonna explain it.

00:05:48.414 --> 00:05:51.016
I came home one day,
and in his dog bed,

00:05:51.016 --> 00:05:52.551
he had all these tissue papers.

00:05:52.551 --> 00:05:54.787
And he was, like, fucking
biting these tissue papers

00:05:54.787 --> 00:05:56.054
and, like, eating them.

00:05:56.054 --> 00:05:57.756
And I was like,
"Benji, why is your dog

00:05:57.756 --> 00:05:59.124
biting all these tissue papers?"

00:05:59.124 --> 00:06:00.759
And he goes, "Oh, motherfucker.

00:06:00.759 --> 00:06:02.962
"He's been in my room again.

00:06:02.962 --> 00:06:04.864
"Yeah, he goes in there
and treasure hunts

00:06:04.864 --> 00:06:05.931
for jizz rags."

00:06:05.931 --> 00:06:07.433
[laughter]

00:06:07.433 --> 00:06:09.034
"And he brings them
back to his bed

00:06:09.034 --> 00:06:10.936
"like a job well done.

00:06:10.936 --> 00:06:13.873
He gets to enjoy his spoils."

00:06:13.873 --> 00:06:15.207
He loves semen.
I don't care.

00:06:15.207 --> 00:06:16.409
I'm not gonna judge him.

00:06:16.409 --> 00:06:18.210
Let him be happy
with who he is.

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:19.578
He knows what he loves.

00:06:19.578 --> 00:06:21.480
I'll just lock my door,
that's all.

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:22.615
I kept the door closed,

00:06:22.615 --> 00:06:24.216
and I wouldn't let him
in my room.

00:06:24.216 --> 00:06:25.618
But once, I went
to the bathroom,

00:06:25.618 --> 00:06:26.752
and when I came back,

00:06:26.752 --> 00:06:28.987
he had one of my
inside-out socks

00:06:28.987 --> 00:06:30.723
in his bed.

00:06:30.723 --> 00:06:32.391
Smart dog.

00:06:32.391 --> 00:06:34.060
[laughter]

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:35.261
Fine, whatever.
I don't care.

00:06:35.261 --> 00:06:36.763
All I want
is to be a dog trainer,

00:06:36.763 --> 00:06:38.597
and I tried everything
to get this dog to fetch.

00:06:38.597 --> 00:06:40.666
I tried everything.
I bought him a little fetch toy.

00:06:40.666 --> 00:06:42.100
It's, like, a rubber
hollow thing.

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:43.736
You put a treat on the inside,

00:06:43.736 --> 00:06:45.905
and then you let him smell it,
and he wags his tail, all happy.

00:06:45.905 --> 00:06:47.673
And then I'd throw it;
he would just look at it...

00:06:47.673 --> 00:06:48.807
[laughter]

00:06:48.807 --> 00:06:50.276
And then look back at me

00:06:50.276 --> 00:06:52.611
like, "You know
you're gonna go get that."

00:06:52.611 --> 00:06:53.912
[laughter]

00:06:53.912 --> 00:06:55.347
I'd be like, "Come on, come on."

00:06:55.347 --> 00:06:56.815
And then I'd be like,
"See, don't you"--

00:06:56.815 --> 00:06:58.951
I'm like,
"You're fucking training me."

00:06:58.951 --> 00:07:01.620
[laughter]

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:03.488
No interest in fetching.

00:07:03.488 --> 00:07:05.857
Anyway, towards the end
of the winter,

00:07:05.857 --> 00:07:07.125
I was having sex with a woman

00:07:07.125 --> 00:07:09.628
and used a condom for once...

00:07:09.628 --> 00:07:12.197
[laughter]
And, uh--

00:07:12.197 --> 00:07:13.632
Feels great to use a condom.

00:07:13.632 --> 00:07:15.367
I feel like I'm not
part of the problem.

00:07:15.367 --> 00:07:17.803
[laughter]

00:07:17.803 --> 00:07:20.473
Anyway, I finished,
and I went to the bathroom

00:07:20.473 --> 00:07:21.807
to throw out the condom,
you know,

00:07:21.807 --> 00:07:23.142
in the trash can
in the bathroom.

00:07:23.142 --> 00:07:24.443
And when I opened the door,
the dog,

00:07:24.443 --> 00:07:25.811
he got all excited
to see me, you know,

00:07:25.811 --> 00:07:27.146
'cause I was in the bedroom
killing it

00:07:27.146 --> 00:07:28.481
for, like, eight hours.

00:07:28.481 --> 00:07:30.883
[laughter]

00:07:30.883 --> 00:07:32.551
Could've been ten minutes.
I don't know.

00:07:32.551 --> 00:07:34.320
Could've been ten.
Dogs can't tell time.

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:35.821
Dogs can't tell time.
Dogs can't tell time.

00:07:35.821 --> 00:07:37.323
To him, it was, like, a day.
It didn't matter.

00:07:37.323 --> 00:07:39.458
Dogs can't tell time.

00:07:39.458 --> 00:07:42.995
[laughter]

00:07:42.995 --> 00:07:44.497
And, uh, I saw him.

00:07:44.497 --> 00:07:46.331
I was like, "Oh, hey, buddy,
excited to see me?"

00:07:46.331 --> 00:07:48.234
But he wasn't looking at me.

00:07:48.234 --> 00:07:50.202
He was looking at my hand

00:07:50.202 --> 00:07:51.670
with the condom in it.

00:07:51.670 --> 00:07:53.372
And I was like, "What are--

00:07:53.372 --> 00:07:54.974
No."

00:07:54.974 --> 00:07:56.175
[laughter]

00:07:56.175 --> 00:07:57.510
And to test it,
I went like that,

00:07:57.510 --> 00:07:59.678
and then he goes, like--
like, up on two legs.

00:07:59.678 --> 00:08:01.179
You know when they do
that thing?

00:08:01.179 --> 00:08:03.682
I'm like, "You fucking slut."

00:08:03.682 --> 00:08:05.084
[laughter]

00:08:05.084 --> 00:08:08.220
To him, it was like
a glass of milk.

00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:09.355
Guys, don't judge him.

00:08:09.355 --> 00:08:11.524
He's happy with who he is.

00:08:11.524 --> 00:08:13.859
We just legalized gay marriage
in this country.

00:08:13.859 --> 00:08:16.662
Don't take a step back
on dog homosexuality.

00:08:16.662 --> 00:08:18.998
[laughter]

00:08:18.998 --> 00:08:20.499
I don't care.
He loves semen.

00:08:20.499 --> 00:08:21.867
Let him be into what he's into.

00:08:21.867 --> 00:08:23.202
That's what he likes.

00:08:23.202 --> 00:08:25.370
That's what he wants.

00:08:25.370 --> 00:08:29.408
But what I want
is to be a dog trainer.

00:08:29.408 --> 00:08:32.444
[laughter]

00:08:32.444 --> 00:08:35.714
So I got
that little fetch toy...

00:08:35.714 --> 00:08:37.216
[laughter]

00:08:37.216 --> 00:08:39.018
And I put--
uh-huh, yup, yup.

00:08:39.018 --> 00:08:40.553
Mm-hmm, yup, yup.
You're right.

00:08:40.553 --> 00:08:42.187
You're right too.
You're right.

00:08:42.187 --> 00:08:43.455
You're right.
That's right, mm-hmm.

00:08:43.455 --> 00:08:44.856
Yup, yup.
That's right.

00:08:44.856 --> 00:08:46.258
You know what's gonna happen.

00:08:46.258 --> 00:08:47.959
Mm-hmm, yup, yup.

00:08:47.959 --> 00:08:50.029
That's right.
Mm-hmm, yup.

00:08:50.029 --> 00:08:51.897
[laughter]

00:08:51.897 --> 00:08:53.966
I put it down,
and then I took the condom,

00:08:53.966 --> 00:08:56.635
and I turned it over,
and I just kind of, like...

00:08:56.635 --> 00:08:58.738
[laughter and groans]

00:08:58.738 --> 00:08:59.805
Emptied it...

00:08:59.805 --> 00:09:02.141
[laughter]

00:09:02.141 --> 00:09:04.076
Onto this fetch toy.

00:09:04.076 --> 00:09:06.478
[laughter]

00:09:06.478 --> 00:09:09.582
And then I let him smell it,
and he loved it.

00:09:09.582 --> 00:09:10.448
[laughter]

00:09:10.448 --> 00:09:12.150
He was like,
"Om, nom, nom."

00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:13.418
He couldn't get enough of it.

00:09:13.418 --> 00:09:14.586
I'd take it, and I'd throw it,

00:09:14.586 --> 00:09:16.254
and he'd fuckin' run after it.

00:09:16.254 --> 00:09:17.656
I'd take it out again
and throw it.

00:09:17.656 --> 00:09:19.224
He was so excited--
you know the thing they do

00:09:19.224 --> 00:09:20.259
where they can't even
get traction,

00:09:20.259 --> 00:09:21.727
where they're just like...

00:09:21.727 --> 00:09:24.096
this for a while,
and then it starts catching in?

00:09:24.096 --> 00:09:26.599
He would do that,
like burning rubber.

00:09:26.599 --> 00:09:27.933
[laughter]

00:09:27.933 --> 00:09:31.103
I jizzed on everything
after that, you guys.

00:09:31.103 --> 00:09:34.173
The tennis ball,
the crinkly toy...

00:09:34.173 --> 00:09:35.908
[laughter]

00:09:35.908 --> 00:09:37.642
All of it.

00:09:37.642 --> 00:09:39.912
Yeah, my methods
are a little bit unorthodox.

00:09:39.912 --> 00:09:41.447
[laughter]

00:09:41.447 --> 00:09:44.650
I'm a lot like House.

00:09:44.650 --> 00:09:47.453
[laughter]

00:09:47.453 --> 00:09:49.455
But there's only one thing
that's important there,

00:09:49.455 --> 00:09:52.524
and that is that
I am a dog trainer.

00:09:52.524 --> 00:09:53.792
[laughter]

00:09:53.792 --> 00:09:56.762
[cheers and applause]
