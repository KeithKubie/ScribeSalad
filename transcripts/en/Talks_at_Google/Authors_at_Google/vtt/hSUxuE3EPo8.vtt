BILL BILLENSTEIN: Well,
welcome, everybody.

00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:03.240
I see a lot of familiar faces.

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.425
But for those of you who don't
know, I am Chef Bill

00:00:05.425 --> 00:00:08.770
Billenstein from the Silicon
Beach Cafe here at Google.

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:10.305
And today we're very proud
to have Amelia

00:00:10.305 --> 00:00:12.960
Saltsman, local cook.

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.140
She made sure that I tell you
that she is not a chef.

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.580
She's a cook.

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:18.300
And she wants you to be
able to cook, too.

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.970
Amelia has written this
wonderful farmers' market

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.900
cookbook, "The Santa Monica
Farmers' Market Cookbook."

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:28.260
She's also a contributor to
KCRW's "Good Food." She is on

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.360
the board of the Garden
City Food Foundation.

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:32.350
AMELIA SALTSMAN: Garden
School Foundation.

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:34.450
BILL BILLENSTEIN: Garden
School Food Foundation.

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:37.540
She's here today to go through
a couple rapid fire recipes

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:40.490
and show you the bounty of the
seasons and some delicious

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:41.730
things that you can
do with your local

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.130
farmer's market produce.

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:45.350
So without further
ado, Amelia.

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:46.510
AMELIA SALTSMAN: Thank
you, Chef.

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:50.030
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:53.680
AMELIA SALTSMAN: Well, I am
delighted to be here.

00:00:53.680 --> 00:01:00.400
And Chef, you pretty well nailed
it, what I'm all about.

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:06.190
What I do is I really like
to help people see the

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:08.560
connections between
their food.

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:09.940
Well, I should say
among because

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:11.640
there are lots of things.

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.760
The food that they eat, what it
does for our health, what

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:17.130
it does for the planet.

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.950
All the things we sort of
worry about in life, the

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.110
answer is actually
really simple--

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.420
start with flavorful,
fresh ingredients.

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:31.320
It's the fastest, easiest
way to healthy,

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.690
delicious cooking fast.

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:36.140
So I'm going to get
this started.

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.850
I'm going to put a little olive
oil in here and throw

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.310
some onions in that I've
already chopped.

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.450
And I'm going to get that going
while I introduce a

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:48.850
little bit more of
what we're doing.

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:50.980
And it's going to take
us a little time to

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:52.230
get adjusted here.

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.850
So how many of you shop at
farmers' markets beyond what

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.070
is brought to you here?

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:02.800
You are so lucky.

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:03.750
Yeah?

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:04.640
OK, great.

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.470
So I'm preaching to the
converted, right?

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:12.010
But how many of you are a little
bit confused about what

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.240
to do with some of the stuff?

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:15.240
Don't have time?

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.140
Maybe it's hard?

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.580
You feel like the window of what
you're trying is a little

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:22.460
bit narrow, like there's
a lot of--

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.700
yeah?

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.480
A lot of ingredients,
but you're not sure

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:25.990
what to do with them?

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:30.080
So what I want to do today is
try to get through as many

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:38.040
things as we can, answering
questions as we go and try to

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.400
show you some of the techniques,
the simple

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:45.020
techniques that you need that
you can just then vary

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:49.310
everything through all
of these vegetables.

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:53.920
Now, I'm not a vegetarian and
this isn't vegetarian cooking.

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.660
And my cookbook, "The Santa
Monica Farmers' Market

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:00.560
Cookbook" is--

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.330
it covers everything.

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:07.910
It covers sustainably raised
meats and eggs and poultry,

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:12.570
all the things that we should
be looking to find as

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:16.190
carefully grown as we can.

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:19.165
Because the key to all
of this is flavor.

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:25.560
Chef and I were just talking,
if you start with the most

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:30.870
delicious ingredients, you'd
really have to do very little.

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:36.950
So that's the trick to cooking
fast and simply.

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:40.810
Another little trick is
to layer flavors.

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:42.720
So I've got some onions
sauteing.

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:46.660
So this first dish we're going
to do is a saute dish.

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:48.700
That's a great technique.

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:53.780
So what you want to do is, with
whatever your cooking,

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:58.270
don't add all the salt,
let's say, at once.

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:00.150
Add a little bit at a time.

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:07.610
That's such an easy technique,
but it will deepen and make

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:11.000
more complex all the flavors
that you're doing.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.930
So we're going to do a Swiss
chard dish first.

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:18.839
Are you all familiar
with Swiss chard?

00:04:18.839 --> 00:04:19.399
You all use it?

00:04:19.399 --> 00:04:20.604
OK.

00:04:20.604 --> 00:04:24.350
Because Cat told me, she's like,
always like I'm not sure

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:26.500
what to do with Swiss chard.

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:29.640
And this technique
works with kale.

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:31.780
It works with other
quick cooking

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:35.050
greens, as for all fabulous.

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:37.370
So basically, we want to
look for contrast.

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:39.060
We're going to do onions.

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:40.690
We're going to do
earthy greens.

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:43.750
We're going to give it some
heat from red pepper.

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:47.090
And we're going to give it some
sweetness from raisins.

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:48.080
So that's another great

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:51.580
technique, contrasting flavors.

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:53.990
Very exciting, really
easy to do.

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:56.750
That's why we all like
salty sweet, right?

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:59.030
Because it's contrasting
flavor.

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:04.520
So one of the things about
cooking fast is,

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:05.880
how do you do it?

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:10.040
So like that.

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:12.190
Don't take a knife and
start cutting.

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:13.635
Want to see it again?

00:05:13.635 --> 00:05:14.310
I love this trick.

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:16.875
A farmer taught me.

00:05:16.875 --> 00:05:17.960
OK?

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:24.840
Now, with Swiss chard, you
can use the stalk.

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:27.560
It sort of has the texture
of celery.

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:30.430
So I've cut up a bunch
here, because we

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:31.660
already separated out.

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:37.520
So I'm going to start it with
the onions because it takes a

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:41.600
little bit longer to cook
than the leaves.

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:47.100
And another trick is that we
don't want to add a whole lot

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:53.350
of liquid to the pan, because
we want the flavors to come

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:54.130
from the vegetables.

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:56.920
Because if you add a lot of
liquid, you're going to have

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:58.170
boiled vegetables.

00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:01.090
And there's nothing really
exciting about that.

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:04.650
So now that I've got these
fabulous-looking leaves, all I

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:06.880
need to do-- can you all see?

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:08.570
OK.

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:09.940
Let me set this aside.

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:11.780
AUDIENCE: Can you
move that bowl?

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:12.160
AMELIA SALTSMAN: This one?

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:14.810
OK, I'm going to set it aside
right here until we're

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:16.430
ready to use it.

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:19.700
OK, so now, like if
I were rolling a

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:20.950
lot of tobacco leaves.

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:26.700
Now I'm going to cut
it assembly line

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:28.340
into these nice strips.

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:33.040
And now that's ready.

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:36.320
And that's only going to take
a couple of minutes to cook.

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:41.880
So what you want to do is soften
the onions, get them

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:43.130
starting to turn sweet.

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:52.720
And the chard stems.

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:54.790
So now what you also
have is texture.

00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:57.380
You've got a contrasting
texture.

00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:01.430
So in about two minutes, we've
hit all these great marks.

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:03.930
Right But all we've done
is cook a little

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:07.160
onion and chard stems.

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:08.470
OK.

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:14.180
So we are going to
add the chard.

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:19.710
And it might take a little
bit more time to--

00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:20.960
we might have to do
it in batches.

00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:28.480
Little salt.

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:34.060
And it's going to wilt
down pretty quickly.

00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:38.610
And you notice, we still haven't
added any water, any

00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:39.860
liquid to the pan.

00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:48.410
And as it's cooking down, I'm
just going to add more.

00:07:48.410 --> 00:07:51.870
So this is two bunches
of chard.

00:07:51.870 --> 00:07:55.680
And you know, this happens
to have white stems.

00:07:55.680 --> 00:08:02.216
But you've seen chard
also comes rainbow.

00:08:02.216 --> 00:08:06.574
Does this remind you an
anything, any other vegetable?

00:08:06.574 --> 00:08:07.440
AUDIENCE: Beets.

00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:08.205
AMELIA SALTSMAN: Beets.

00:08:08.205 --> 00:08:10.780
Beets, I didn't hear you?

00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:11.610
OK.

00:08:11.610 --> 00:08:13.640
So very close relative.

00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:15.850
Farmers would say that
chard is really a

00:08:15.850 --> 00:08:17.120
beet without a root.

00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:18.810
That's how closely related.

00:08:18.810 --> 00:08:21.860
So that means if you
buy beets, don't

00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:24.050
throw the tops away.

00:08:24.050 --> 00:08:26.920
You can cook them
just like this.

00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:28.640
I like to call that a twofer.

00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:32.650
And actually, with fresh beets,
the tops are the most

00:08:32.650 --> 00:08:33.350
nutritious.

00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:35.524
It's like any dark,
leafy green.

00:08:35.524 --> 00:08:36.750
It's really good for you.

00:08:36.750 --> 00:08:38.000
Very good value.

00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:43.070
And here we go.

00:08:45.470 --> 00:08:46.340
Can I give that to you?

00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:48.290
Thanks.

00:08:48.290 --> 00:08:50.342
This is Janine, everybody.

00:08:50.342 --> 00:08:52.970
Oh, and guess what I
forgot to put in?

00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:57.055
I forgot to add the garlic.

00:08:57.055 --> 00:09:00.850
So I'm just going to stick it
right here on the side.

00:09:00.850 --> 00:09:02.540
And I want you to take
a look at this.

00:09:02.540 --> 00:09:04.810
Now, does this look like
sliced garlic that

00:09:04.810 --> 00:09:06.740
you're used to seeing?

00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:06.880
No.

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:08.660
So I'm going to stick it in.

00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:12.296
I'm going to show you a little
interesting factoid.

00:09:17.590 --> 00:09:22.835
And you notice I'm not
using a lot of oil.

00:09:28.614 --> 00:09:30.595
Do you see how the color
is brightening?

00:09:34.810 --> 00:09:38.480
Once the color is bright, we're

00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:44.516
going to add our raisins.

00:09:44.516 --> 00:09:49.170
And let's add a nice pinch
of red pepper.

00:09:59.170 --> 00:10:01.430
Now, I'm going to
cover the pan--

00:10:01.430 --> 00:10:02.980
very big technique.

00:10:02.980 --> 00:10:06.300
But that's an important
technique.

00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:09.730
And can you see how
it's cooking down?

00:10:09.730 --> 00:10:14.940
I'm going to cover the
pan, which will allow

00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:16.980
the steam to develop.

00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:22.990
And I'm hoping that that's going
to be enough moisture to

00:10:22.990 --> 00:10:24.870
soften the chard enough.

00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:28.010
And it just needs to cook,
maybe 5 minutes

00:10:28.010 --> 00:10:29.870
or so, 5 or 10 minutes.

00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:31.450
If it cooks longer that's OK.

00:10:31.450 --> 00:10:34.700
But if you're in a hurry,
that's OK too.

00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:38.800
And I'm going to check
it in a few minutes.

00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:42.140
If it seems like it's dry or
sticking, I'll add a little

00:10:42.140 --> 00:10:43.050
bit of water.

00:10:43.050 --> 00:10:44.905
Otherwise, I'm good.

00:10:44.905 --> 00:10:47.550
So let me show you the garlic.

00:10:47.550 --> 00:10:47.940
AUDIENCE: Question.

00:10:47.940 --> 00:10:48.916
AMELIA SALTSMAN: Yeah.

00:10:48.916 --> 00:10:53.310
AUDIENCE: Do you chop the raisin
or just use them whole?

00:10:53.310 --> 00:10:55.170
AMELIA SALTSMAN: OK, I just
threw the raisins in.

00:10:55.170 --> 00:10:57.430
And by the way, these
are raisins

00:10:57.430 --> 00:11:00.010
produced by a grape grower.

00:11:00.010 --> 00:11:02.630
I bought the raisins at the
farmers' market directly from

00:11:02.630 --> 00:11:03.880
the producer.

00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:08.080
So they are this season's
grapes, or from last summer.

00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:11.030
And it makes a really
big difference.

00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:15.500
So the steam is going to soften
the raisins as well.

00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:17.270
So it's doing its thing.

00:11:17.270 --> 00:11:19.640
I'm not doing much.

00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:21.500
So garlic.

00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:23.430
Everything has a season.

00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:26.760
And we're used to seeing
dried bulbs of garlic.

00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:32.030
But what we've got here
is late spring garlic.

00:11:32.030 --> 00:11:33.520
In the beginning
of the season--

00:11:37.291 --> 00:11:40.900
OK, these are baby leeks.

00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:41.720
They're not garlic.

00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:45.310
But in the beginning, garlic
looks like this.

00:11:45.310 --> 00:11:48.276
Slim hips and no cloves.

00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:56.880
As the plant grows, the bulb
forms, the cloves form.

00:11:56.880 --> 00:11:58.130
Can I give you that?

00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:04.670
And you can start to see
the cloves forming.

00:12:04.670 --> 00:12:06.770
So I used late spring garlic.

00:12:06.770 --> 00:12:08.580
When it's young, you
can use the tops.

00:12:08.580 --> 00:12:10.440
These are already getting
too tough to use.

00:12:14.904 --> 00:12:18.340
So I'm going to take
the carrots.

00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:20.170
So we're going to let that cook
and we're going to make a

00:12:20.170 --> 00:12:21.090
carrot dish.

00:12:21.090 --> 00:12:24.230
Do you have any other questions
about that?

00:12:24.230 --> 00:12:26.980
Besides chopping raisins?

00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:29.680
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:31.890
AMELIA SALTSMAN: No.

00:12:31.890 --> 00:12:34.100
So it's very juicy.

00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:37.270
Green garlic is very
mild in flavor.

00:12:37.270 --> 00:12:41.530
It has kind of an herbaceous,
sweet garlic flavor.

00:12:41.530 --> 00:12:43.940
And this is a perfect
time to use it.

00:12:43.940 --> 00:12:48.650
As the plant develops, it
gets stronger in flavor.

00:12:48.650 --> 00:12:54.210
So grilling, another
great technique.

00:12:54.210 --> 00:12:56.720
Roasting, another great
technique, but we don't have

00:12:56.720 --> 00:12:57.250
an oven here.

00:12:57.250 --> 00:12:59.660
But we'll talk about
that in a second.

00:12:59.660 --> 00:13:06.140
So instead of putting oil on the
grill, I'm putting oil--

00:13:06.140 --> 00:13:08.330
a little bit of oil--

00:13:08.330 --> 00:13:11.380
on the carrots.

00:13:11.380 --> 00:13:13.900
And I'll tell you more about
the carrots in a minute.

00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:15.910
So I like sweet and spicy.

00:13:15.910 --> 00:13:19.040
So carrots are really
sweet by themselves.

00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:23.240
A little salt right
in the bowl.

00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:26.500
Now, I've blanched these carrots
before I started.

00:13:29.150 --> 00:13:30.785
You all familiar
with that term?

00:13:30.785 --> 00:13:36.670
Blanching means to boil just
briefly in salted water, and

00:13:36.670 --> 00:13:37.930
then drain it.

00:13:37.930 --> 00:13:41.800
And then, shock it with ice and
cold water so that you get

00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:44.120
this fabulous--

00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:46.276
you preserve the color.

00:13:46.276 --> 00:13:50.660
Oh, nice sound.

00:13:50.660 --> 00:13:51.030
Yes?

00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:53.690
AUDIENCE: Did you blanch them
after you cut them?

00:13:53.690 --> 00:13:54.510
AMELIA SALTSMAN: Yes.

00:13:54.510 --> 00:13:56.420
So the question was,
do you blanch them

00:13:56.420 --> 00:13:58.280
after you cut them?

00:13:58.280 --> 00:13:59.510
And yes, I'm going
to show you--

00:13:59.510 --> 00:14:00.770
I'm going to go through
the steps.

00:14:00.770 --> 00:14:03.560
What I want to do is get
them on the grill.

00:14:06.370 --> 00:14:09.430
And I think you already noticed
that what I've done is

00:14:09.430 --> 00:14:15.125
cut them so that I have a really
big cooking surface.

00:14:21.707 --> 00:14:24.600
Now, that's a carrot, right?

00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:25.170
OK.

00:14:25.170 --> 00:14:27.950
So we'll let those go for
a couple minutes.

00:14:27.950 --> 00:14:29.200
I'll just set this-- this
is fine right here.

00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:35.140
Fabulous variety of carrots.

00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:38.060
This is called a Chantenay
variety.

00:14:38.060 --> 00:14:40.260
Lots of great carrots
out there.

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:42.890
But your carrot needs to
taste-- this is my

00:14:42.890 --> 00:14:44.390
compost bowl here.

00:14:44.390 --> 00:14:47.230
Tell me if it's in your way.

00:14:47.230 --> 00:14:49.360
Your carrots should taste
really great.

00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:53.980
When you cook it briefly,
certain vegetables do better

00:14:53.980 --> 00:14:56.270
and their flavors are enhanced,
particularly

00:14:56.270 --> 00:15:03.100
vegetables with fat soluble
vitamins like carrots.

00:15:03.100 --> 00:15:05.630
So carrots are kind of dense.

00:15:05.630 --> 00:15:09.180
They're not filled with water.

00:15:09.180 --> 00:15:11.110
But you want it to be really
sweet and you want to heighten

00:15:11.110 --> 00:15:12.350
the flavor.

00:15:12.350 --> 00:15:15.460
So I'm cutting it at an angle.

00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:16.870
And can you hear?

00:15:16.870 --> 00:15:19.050
This is not like a super
hard carrot.

00:15:19.050 --> 00:15:21.870
Did you see how quickly and
nicely my knife was moving

00:15:21.870 --> 00:15:23.780
through it?

00:15:23.780 --> 00:15:25.310
So you want this
nice big slabs.

00:15:25.310 --> 00:15:28.390
And anything-- little tiny
piece, just eat it because

00:15:28.390 --> 00:15:30.030
it's really good, and
good for you.

00:15:30.030 --> 00:15:37.530
So I'm going to check
our chard.

00:15:42.223 --> 00:15:45.150
Isn't that looking beautiful?

00:15:45.150 --> 00:15:46.460
Does it smell good?

00:15:46.460 --> 00:15:47.670
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:15:47.670 --> 00:15:50.512
AMELIA SALTSMAN: And look at
how pretty the green garlic

00:15:50.512 --> 00:15:51.625
got in the dish.

00:15:51.625 --> 00:15:54.190
Did you see how all its
pretty little strands?

00:15:54.190 --> 00:15:55.525
So we eat with our eyes, too.

00:15:55.525 --> 00:15:58.170
We're using all our senses
already and we've only made

00:15:58.170 --> 00:15:59.060
one and a half dishes.

00:15:59.060 --> 00:16:01.340
So this will be ready
in a minute or two.

00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:07.930
And let's see.

00:16:07.930 --> 00:16:09.130
What are we ready for?

00:16:09.130 --> 00:16:10.390
Let's see how these are doing.

00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:22.800
So when you've grilled, one of
the problems with grilling--

00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:25.150
everything gets burnt before
it gets cooked.

00:16:25.150 --> 00:16:27.160
Oh, somebody's nodding
in agreement.

00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:28.310
Indeed.

00:16:28.310 --> 00:16:31.290
A couple of little tricks.

00:16:31.290 --> 00:16:33.500
Don't have the heat too high.

00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:36.110
And vegetables, like
carrots that are

00:16:36.110 --> 00:16:40.810
dense, blanch them first.

00:16:40.810 --> 00:16:44.340
And then, that way-- and so I
just boiled them until you saw

00:16:44.340 --> 00:16:46.900
they were kind of pliable.

00:16:46.900 --> 00:16:48.450
Just slightly pliable.

00:16:48.450 --> 00:16:53.510
So this big pot full of this
was maybe three minutes.

00:16:53.510 --> 00:16:56.150
The nice thing is you
can do that ahead.

00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:58.250
Do it the day ahead.

00:16:58.250 --> 00:17:01.470
And let's say you're having
people over, then you just

00:17:01.470 --> 00:17:03.815
toss those with olive
oil and do it.

00:17:03.815 --> 00:17:05.010
And you know how the
other thing is?

00:17:05.010 --> 00:17:09.980
Grilling vegetables takes a lot
longer than grilling meat.

00:17:09.980 --> 00:17:12.015
Blanch them and it will
take a few minutes.

00:17:15.060 --> 00:17:19.130
After that, you can just go on
to grill whatever else you

00:17:19.130 --> 00:17:22.491
want to throw on the barbie.

00:17:22.491 --> 00:17:24.926
AUDIENCE: Could you do
that for corn too?

00:17:24.926 --> 00:17:25.413
AMELIA SALTSMAN: Pardon?

00:17:25.413 --> 00:17:26.880
AUDIENCE: Would you do
that for corn too?

00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:27.684
AMELIA SALTSMAN: You know what?

00:17:27.684 --> 00:17:27.908
I would.

00:17:27.908 --> 00:17:32.180
I actually think that
corn needs moisture.

00:17:32.180 --> 00:17:38.310
So you can do that by doing it
in the husk because the husk

00:17:38.310 --> 00:17:41.080
acts as a natural sealer.

00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:45.830
So that's one way
to grill corn.

00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:53.010
Another way is to just boil it,
parboil it or blanch it.

00:17:53.010 --> 00:17:55.720
And then, just finish it off on
the grill to get that sort

00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:58.800
of smoky complexity that
you're looking to

00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:02.280
counterbalance with the
sweetness of the vegetable.

00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:04.930
So we've got the same thing
happening with the carrots.

00:18:04.930 --> 00:18:09.240
Sweet carrots, smoke, heat,
all of those things.

00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:11.725
So let's see, I'm going to
need-- how we doing with this?

00:18:11.725 --> 00:18:13.980
JANINE: I think they're
almost ready.

00:18:13.980 --> 00:18:15.230
AMELIA SALTSMAN: OK.

00:18:18.230 --> 00:18:22.440
So what we want-- and
this is not the most

00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:25.590
ideal cooking situation.

00:18:25.590 --> 00:18:27.440
Now, I don't know if any
of you can see it.

00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:29.425
Let's turn that down
a little bit.

00:18:29.425 --> 00:18:35.850
But do you see that the carrots
are blistering a

00:18:35.850 --> 00:18:36.760
little as well?

00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:39.440
That's also because they
were boiled first.

00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:42.650
And that sort of blistering,
it's almost like when you're

00:18:42.650 --> 00:18:46.770
making pastry and you get these
little layers of air.

00:18:46.770 --> 00:18:50.020
It also just enriches
the flavor.

00:18:50.020 --> 00:18:52.190
Grilling potatoes--

00:18:52.190 --> 00:18:56.830
I would definitely blanch them
first if I wanted to make

00:18:56.830 --> 00:18:58.115
spectacular potatoes.

00:19:02.180 --> 00:19:04.505
And you see there, what happens
when you're grilling

00:19:04.505 --> 00:19:08.490
or roasting is that you're
losing the moisture in the

00:19:08.490 --> 00:19:11.800
vegetable and concentrating
the flavor.

00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:17.440
So if you don't have great
produce, this will improve

00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:18.700
what you have.

00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:23.010
If you have this kind of
produce, it will really sing.

00:19:23.010 --> 00:19:24.850
It will really sing.

00:19:24.850 --> 00:19:27.900
These dishes will be great,
whatever you use.

00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:29.530
But if you use this kind of

00:19:29.530 --> 00:19:36.410
ingredient, it will be fabulous.

00:19:36.410 --> 00:19:39.160
And I hope you'll agree.

00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:40.910
One of the things that I did--

00:19:40.910 --> 00:19:43.800
speaking of roasting.

00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:46.960
I roasted off some
summer squash.

00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:49.310
We're just starting
to see this.

00:19:49.310 --> 00:19:53.030
And I wanted you to see
what that looks like.

00:19:53.030 --> 00:19:57.510
I think you can see
it from here.

00:19:57.510 --> 00:20:02.300
All I did was toss it with a
tiny bit of olive oil, a

00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:06.940
little salt, and I put it cut
side down on a sheet pan.

00:20:06.940 --> 00:20:12.140
And I roasted it for 15,
18 minutes at 425.

00:20:12.140 --> 00:20:16.590
And because there's so much
natural sugar in the squash, I

00:20:16.590 --> 00:20:19.080
got that beautiful
caramelization.

00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:23.340
You won't have that with
industrially produced,

00:20:23.340 --> 00:20:26.845
industrially shipped and
distributed ingredients.

00:20:26.845 --> 00:20:28.110
You just can't.

00:20:28.110 --> 00:20:29.920
So that's what you're
looking for.

00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:37.160
So all I did was one knife
cut and I was good.

00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:38.850
So with carrots, you
don't need to

00:20:38.850 --> 00:20:41.380
blanch them before roasting.

00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:46.520
You don't need to blanch
zucchini or summer squash.

00:20:46.520 --> 00:20:50.580
But what you do get is--

00:20:50.580 --> 00:20:52.380
in fact, roasting is one
of my favorite things.

00:20:52.380 --> 00:20:53.350
I have a lot more control.

00:20:53.350 --> 00:20:56.110
I don't have to worry
about all of this.

00:20:56.110 --> 00:20:57.075
It's just a lot easier.

00:20:57.075 --> 00:20:59.580
You can serve it at
room temperature.

00:20:59.580 --> 00:21:02.020
And what I want to show you is
we're going to make a couple

00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:04.840
of different flavor profiles.

00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:06.450
We're going to finish
one batch one way

00:21:06.450 --> 00:21:08.525
and one batch another.

00:21:08.525 --> 00:21:12.310
But I am going to move
on to tomatoes.

00:21:16.156 --> 00:21:18.650
Get that.

00:21:18.650 --> 00:21:21.320
So it's not really--

00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:23.190
well, let's finish
with this first.

00:21:23.190 --> 00:21:24.440
This is done.

00:21:31.700 --> 00:21:33.890
All right, what do you think?

00:21:33.890 --> 00:21:35.140
Nice?

00:21:36.730 --> 00:21:39.920
Now, you can turn this
into a main dish.

00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:44.500
I love this dish because it
works a lot of different ways.

00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:47.000
You can serve this
as a side dish.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:50.510
You can toss this with pasta.

00:21:50.510 --> 00:21:55.500
You can chop it up and add some
more seasonings and serve

00:21:55.500 --> 00:21:57.890
it like as a bruschetta
topping.

00:22:00.610 --> 00:22:03.015
And basically, what you're doing
is eating your greens.

00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:08.420
Now, what I did today--

00:22:08.420 --> 00:22:10.770
are you are familiar
with farro?

00:22:10.770 --> 00:22:11.840
Ancient wheat.

00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:14.690
Anybody gluten free here?

00:22:14.690 --> 00:22:18.220
OK, so this really is--
it's a vegan dish.

00:22:18.220 --> 00:22:20.430
I wasn't attempting to
make a vegan dish.

00:22:20.430 --> 00:22:21.540
What I'm attempting
to do is have

00:22:21.540 --> 00:22:23.530
something really delicious.

00:22:23.530 --> 00:22:26.955
And as added value, it happens
to hit all these other marks.

00:22:32.020 --> 00:22:34.140
Quinoa would be great.

00:22:34.140 --> 00:22:35.740
Rice would be great.

00:22:35.740 --> 00:22:37.940
So let's say this is
a building block.

00:22:37.940 --> 00:22:39.640
We've got farro.

00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:40.890
We've got our greens.

00:22:43.630 --> 00:22:45.880
And I think it would look really
beautiful if we just

00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:48.810
did that, don't you?

00:22:48.810 --> 00:22:51.760
Now, if I wanted to really make
this into a nice main

00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:57.420
dish, I could add chick peas.

00:22:57.420 --> 00:23:01.260
I could add some of those
carrots, toss it all together

00:23:01.260 --> 00:23:02.830
and have a big bowl
of something.

00:23:02.830 --> 00:23:04.825
I could season it with cheese.

00:23:07.580 --> 00:23:10.868
What other items do you--
what do you like?

00:23:10.868 --> 00:23:11.354
AUDIENCE: Steak on top.

00:23:11.354 --> 00:23:12.326
AMELIA SALTSMAN: What?

00:23:12.326 --> 00:23:14.270
What did you say, Cat?

00:23:14.270 --> 00:23:15.728
AUDIENCE: Steak on top.

00:23:15.728 --> 00:23:17.130
AMELIA SALTSMAN: Steak on top.

00:23:17.130 --> 00:23:18.380
Absolutely.

00:23:23.050 --> 00:23:29.025
But I think a lot of us know how
to cook a steak, but most

00:23:29.025 --> 00:23:32.470
of us have trouble with some
of the vegetables.

00:23:32.470 --> 00:23:33.422
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:23:33.422 --> 00:23:34.880
AMELIA SALTSMAN: Oh, what
was that laughing?

00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:36.080
What was that?

00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:36.480
Yes?

00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:38.945
No?

00:23:38.945 --> 00:23:41.030
Do you feel like you
could do this?

00:23:41.030 --> 00:23:42.930
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:23:42.930 --> 00:23:44.850
AMELIA SALTSMAN: Because my goal
here today is for you to

00:23:44.850 --> 00:23:47.990
walk away feeling like, you
know, if I have 10 minutes, I

00:23:47.990 --> 00:23:49.240
could make dinner.

00:23:55.037 --> 00:23:57.432
AUDIENCE: Do you have any
preference in the olive oil,

00:23:57.432 --> 00:23:59.630
like virgin--

00:23:59.630 --> 00:24:02.650
AMELIA SALTSMAN: Extra virgin
olive oil and something that

00:24:02.650 --> 00:24:03.610
tastes great.

00:24:03.610 --> 00:24:04.460
You know what?

00:24:04.460 --> 00:24:06.350
This is the thing--

00:24:06.350 --> 00:24:09.340
when you're cooking this simply,
everything better

00:24:09.340 --> 00:24:10.870
taste good.

00:24:10.870 --> 00:24:12.430
Every ingredient
because there's

00:24:12.430 --> 00:24:16.060
nothing to hide behind.

00:24:16.060 --> 00:24:17.980
AUDIENCE: Any thoughts on
substituting coconut

00:24:17.980 --> 00:24:22.300
oil for olive oil?

00:24:22.300 --> 00:24:24.700
AMELIA SALTSMAN: What I would
do, my personal preference--

00:24:24.700 --> 00:24:27.540
so the question is substituting
maybe coconut oil

00:24:27.540 --> 00:24:29.420
for olive oil.

00:24:29.420 --> 00:24:30.770
I like avocado oil.

00:24:30.770 --> 00:24:33.900
I like its butteriness.

00:24:33.900 --> 00:24:35.550
If you want something
really mild, you

00:24:35.550 --> 00:24:37.480
could use avocado oil.

00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:40.880
You could use grape seed oil.

00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:44.185
So I think that looks pretty
spectacular, right?

00:24:44.185 --> 00:24:46.750
If I do say so myself.

00:24:46.750 --> 00:24:50.700
So we're building a nice little
buffet here for later.

00:24:56.480 --> 00:24:59.270
All right, so now we'll
take the tomatoes.

00:24:59.270 --> 00:25:03.130
So it's not really tomato season
here, but it is tomato

00:25:03.130 --> 00:25:08.030
season in the desert, where
by the time the rest of

00:25:08.030 --> 00:25:13.340
California tomatoes show up,
their season will be done.

00:25:13.340 --> 00:25:19.945
So talking about seasonality,
you want to eat in season.

00:25:19.945 --> 00:25:22.340
And you say, why are there
already tomatoes?

00:25:22.340 --> 00:25:24.820
It's because they're growing
near Palm Springs where it's

00:25:24.820 --> 00:25:27.240
really hot.

00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:28.300
That's what you want
to look for.

00:25:28.300 --> 00:25:33.540
If it's not in season, there's
enough stuff to wait for.

00:25:33.540 --> 00:25:36.050
So this is going to be
an early tomato.

00:25:36.050 --> 00:25:38.380
Here's another great technique
I'm going to show you.

00:25:38.380 --> 00:25:41.250
We're going to make an instant
cold tomato soup.

00:25:44.020 --> 00:25:47.720
And the better the tomato,
the better the soup.

00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:51.470
So I'm making this today, but
in August, the soup is going

00:25:51.470 --> 00:25:53.620
to be ethereal.

00:25:53.620 --> 00:25:56.030
Because the better the tomato,
the more sun the tomato has

00:25:56.030 --> 00:25:58.330
had, the better it's
going to be.

00:25:58.330 --> 00:26:04.455
So here's a great way of getting
just tomato pulp.

00:26:04.455 --> 00:26:09.560
I'm going to poke out the seeds
with my finger, this

00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:10.810
great tool.

00:26:16.050 --> 00:26:17.810
And I'm going to squeeze
out some of the juice.

00:26:17.810 --> 00:26:20.120
And there we go, seeded.

00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:23.890
Now, I'm saving the juice
because we're making a cold

00:26:23.890 --> 00:26:25.140
tomato soup.

00:26:27.850 --> 00:26:30.650
But watch this little
magic trick.

00:26:35.190 --> 00:26:36.470
Now we need to peel
the tomato.

00:26:36.470 --> 00:26:37.910
What are we going to do?

00:26:37.910 --> 00:26:40.310
In one move I'm going
to get tomato pulp

00:26:40.310 --> 00:26:42.840
and skin the tomato.

00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:47.470
The skin is pretty tough, so
it's protecting my fingers.

00:26:47.470 --> 00:26:54.970
I'm using it on the orange
cheese side until I get down

00:26:54.970 --> 00:26:56.220
to the skin.

00:27:09.690 --> 00:27:10.940
Voila.

00:27:14.638 --> 00:27:15.596
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:27:15.596 --> 00:27:17.033
AMELIA SALTSMAN: Pardon?

00:27:17.033 --> 00:27:19.234
AUDIENCE: Can you skip the
seeding part and just scrape

00:27:19.234 --> 00:27:23.130
with the grater and
will it work?

00:27:23.130 --> 00:27:25.230
AMELIA SALTSMAN: If you don't
care about having the seeds--

00:27:28.890 --> 00:27:29.376
yes, you can.

00:27:29.376 --> 00:27:33.610
So the question was, can you
skip the seeding part?

00:27:33.610 --> 00:27:34.290
Yes, if you don't care.

00:27:34.290 --> 00:27:36.400
Now, why do people take
out the seeds?

00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:38.220
Well, it's a change
in texture.

00:27:38.220 --> 00:27:42.350
Sometimes the tomato seeds can
be a little bit bitter.

00:27:42.350 --> 00:27:43.670
But yeah.

00:27:43.670 --> 00:27:47.400
But as you can see, it doesn't
take very long at all.

00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:48.876
Yes?

00:27:48.876 --> 00:27:53.160
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE], can you
just put it in the blender?

00:27:53.160 --> 00:27:54.630
AMELIA SALTSMAN: Oh,
great question.

00:27:54.630 --> 00:27:57.650
Why are we doing this instead of
putting it in the blender?

00:27:57.650 --> 00:28:01.000
Well, because when you put in
a blender, what you get is

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:03.740
this really frothy thing.

00:28:03.740 --> 00:28:07.600
And that this is all
about the tomato.

00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:10.190
And you'll find that the
mouth feel of this is

00:28:10.190 --> 00:28:14.370
just much more pleasing.

00:28:14.370 --> 00:28:24.950
And let's say that you wanted
to cook a dish with fresh

00:28:24.950 --> 00:28:30.360
tomatoes, like you wanted to
start sauteing, and then maybe

00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:33.570
have some beans and a
little fresh tomato.

00:28:33.570 --> 00:28:34.820
There you go.

00:28:37.130 --> 00:28:41.520
So this actually, this
is the soup.

00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:42.770
We're going to add
a little salt.

00:28:46.730 --> 00:28:49.025
And we're going to add a little
red wine vinegar.

00:28:52.820 --> 00:28:56.260
And if you want, you can add
a tiny bit of olive oil.

00:28:56.260 --> 00:28:58.275
Fat carries flavor, but
you don't need much.

00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:06.290
And then, you would
chill this.

00:29:06.290 --> 00:29:09.150
And then you can do all
kinds of add-ins.

00:29:09.150 --> 00:29:12.550
You can top-- we're going
to top it with avocado.

00:29:12.550 --> 00:29:13.570
But you could do it
with cucumber.

00:29:13.570 --> 00:29:14.600
You could put in shrimp.

00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:18.340
You could put in anything
you wanted.

00:29:18.340 --> 00:29:23.580
So this is going to be a
fabulous cold tomato soup.

00:29:23.580 --> 00:29:26.480
I hope you'll be pleasantly
surprised.

00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:30.120
And all of the juices we're just
going to add right back

00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:33.060
in there from seeding
the tomato.

00:29:33.060 --> 00:29:34.610
Does anybody want to
try doing this?

00:29:34.610 --> 00:29:36.880
Any volunteer?

00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:37.400
Yeah?

00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:37.990
All right.

00:29:37.990 --> 00:29:40.070
We got a taker.

00:29:40.070 --> 00:29:41.110
What's your name?

00:29:41.110 --> 00:29:41.860
AUDIENCE: Lily.

00:29:41.860 --> 00:29:43.110
AMELIA SALTSMAN: Lily.

00:29:46.146 --> 00:29:48.460
AUDIENCE: Can you add cream
to a cold tomato soup?

00:29:48.460 --> 00:29:50.620
AMELIA SALTSMAN: Can you add
cream to a cold tomato soup?

00:29:50.620 --> 00:29:52.650
Why yes, you can.

00:29:52.650 --> 00:29:54.805
Wouldn't that be delicious?

00:29:54.805 --> 00:29:56.990
See, she's cooking.

00:29:56.990 --> 00:29:59.080
That's how easy it is.

00:29:59.080 --> 00:30:00.220
Let's see.

00:30:00.220 --> 00:30:01.470
I need some utensils.

00:30:07.682 --> 00:30:09.566
AUDIENCE: In this bowl
or another one?

00:30:09.566 --> 00:30:12.130
AMELIA SALTSMAN: No, we can
do it right in here.

00:30:12.130 --> 00:30:13.920
OK, so you want to get
rid of the seeds.

00:30:13.920 --> 00:30:16.860
So let me give you something
to get the seeds out into.

00:30:16.860 --> 00:30:19.030
So just poke.

00:30:19.030 --> 00:30:22.240
And we won't worry
about straining.

00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:23.450
Let's put that right in there.

00:30:23.450 --> 00:30:24.700
We'll get rid of this.

00:30:34.590 --> 00:30:35.840
Should I time you?

00:30:45.430 --> 00:30:48.980
I need the herbs and
so on for this.

00:30:48.980 --> 00:30:51.110
And I'll take the other--

00:30:51.110 --> 00:30:54.395
I'll take everything seasoning
both of these.

00:31:02.540 --> 00:31:03.090
There you go.

00:31:03.090 --> 00:31:06.020
She's a master.

00:31:06.020 --> 00:31:06.740
Right?

00:31:06.740 --> 00:31:08.400
Anybody else want to try the
other half of tomato?

00:31:11.591 --> 00:31:13.475
AUDIENCE: I'll try
the other half.

00:31:13.475 --> 00:31:13.950
AMELIA SALTSMAN: OK.

00:31:13.950 --> 00:31:14.765
What's your name?

00:31:14.765 --> 00:31:15.900
AUDIENCE: I'm PJ.

00:31:15.900 --> 00:31:16.500
AMELIA SALTSMAN: Nice
to meet you.

00:31:16.500 --> 00:31:17.356
AUDIENCE: Nice to meet you.

00:31:17.356 --> 00:31:19.162
I'm going to go wash my hands.

00:31:19.162 --> 00:31:20.460
AMELIA SALTSMAN: OK.

00:31:20.460 --> 00:31:22.420
All right, so now
we've got these

00:31:22.420 --> 00:31:24.310
gorgeous grilled carrots.

00:31:24.310 --> 00:31:24.880
Look at that.

00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:26.130
Nice, appetizing.

00:31:28.710 --> 00:31:32.690
You could serve them just the
way they are, but we're going

00:31:32.690 --> 00:31:35.420
to dress them.

00:31:35.420 --> 00:31:38.580
Let's do some--

00:31:38.580 --> 00:31:43.710
we're going to do one sort of
Greek or Middle Eastern style.

00:31:43.710 --> 00:31:46.190
A little olive oil, a
little lemon zest.

00:31:46.190 --> 00:31:53.150
A five-hole zester, very handy
tool for making beautiful,

00:31:53.150 --> 00:31:54.300
long curls.

00:31:54.300 --> 00:31:56.120
And do you notice that I'm--

00:31:56.120 --> 00:31:58.020
here's another big technique.

00:31:58.020 --> 00:32:03.170
I'm doing it right over the food
because all the essential

00:32:03.170 --> 00:32:06.532
oils are in the colored part
of the citrus peel.

00:32:10.080 --> 00:32:11.840
Can you already smell
the lemon?

00:32:11.840 --> 00:32:14.200
It's really strong over here.

00:32:17.990 --> 00:32:22.370
And let's do a squeeze
of lemon.

00:32:22.370 --> 00:32:24.720
And we've got some
chopped parsley.

00:32:28.290 --> 00:32:29.630
And let's do a little--

00:32:29.630 --> 00:32:34.170
remember we were layering our
flavors and our salt?

00:32:34.170 --> 00:32:36.390
It's always nice, even though
these have a little salt in

00:32:36.390 --> 00:32:39.375
them, to finish with a
top layer of salt.

00:32:39.375 --> 00:32:40.730
Not a lot.

00:32:40.730 --> 00:32:43.360
And what I'm using
here is something

00:32:43.360 --> 00:32:45.390
called Maldon sea salt.

00:32:45.390 --> 00:32:47.280
Can you see those big flakes?

00:32:47.280 --> 00:32:49.810
It's a great finishing salt.

00:32:49.810 --> 00:32:51.250
It's really nice in salads.

00:32:51.250 --> 00:32:55.920
You get a nice sort of clean
burst of flavor.

00:32:55.920 --> 00:33:00.460
And since we're doing this
Middle Eastern style or Greek

00:33:00.460 --> 00:33:02.860
style, how about a little
feta cheese?

00:33:02.860 --> 00:33:03.890
Isn't that beautiful?

00:33:03.890 --> 00:33:05.260
What do you think?

00:33:05.260 --> 00:33:06.885
Now, this would be great
with oregano.

00:33:06.885 --> 00:33:10.670
This would be great with
mint in this particular

00:33:10.670 --> 00:33:12.090
application.

00:33:12.090 --> 00:33:15.580
This is the app.

00:33:15.580 --> 00:33:20.310
But now, let's do a completely
different take.

00:33:23.300 --> 00:33:26.390
Let's do something Southeast
Asian instead.

00:33:26.390 --> 00:33:30.460
Let's do lime.

00:33:30.460 --> 00:33:33.165
I think we need lime zest
too, don't you?

00:33:36.135 --> 00:33:37.540
You can turn off the grill.

00:33:37.540 --> 00:33:39.060
Yeah, that'd be great.

00:33:39.060 --> 00:33:40.670
So a little lime.

00:33:40.670 --> 00:33:42.600
Totally different
aroma, right?

00:33:45.590 --> 00:33:47.410
You could do fish sauce
if you wanted.

00:33:47.410 --> 00:33:49.730
Let's get some lime in here.

00:33:49.730 --> 00:33:51.180
We could do red pepper flakes.

00:33:51.180 --> 00:33:54.110
But how about--

00:33:54.110 --> 00:33:58.350
should we do some sriracha
instead?

00:33:58.350 --> 00:34:01.830
That looks good to me.

00:34:01.830 --> 00:34:04.610
And how about some cilantro?

00:34:04.610 --> 00:34:09.570
Now, I want to show you
something about the cilantro.

00:34:09.570 --> 00:34:12.670
And I think having some big
leaves would be really pretty

00:34:12.670 --> 00:34:13.920
here, don't you?

00:34:16.480 --> 00:34:18.330
What do you think?

00:34:18.330 --> 00:34:20.409
OK, same grilled
carrot, totally

00:34:20.409 --> 00:34:22.110
different flavor profile.

00:34:22.110 --> 00:34:24.400
I'm sure you could think
of about four others.

00:34:32.080 --> 00:34:36.110
But what I wanted to show
you is cilantro's really

00:34:36.110 --> 00:34:37.199
perishable.

00:34:37.199 --> 00:34:44.179
You want to buy cilantro
from a farmer who

00:34:44.179 --> 00:34:45.340
leaves the roots on.

00:34:45.340 --> 00:34:46.610
It keeps it fresh longer.

00:34:50.120 --> 00:34:51.270
That's a careful farmer.

00:34:51.270 --> 00:34:53.400
That's a farmer who really
cares about his

00:34:53.400 --> 00:34:55.429
crops or her crops.

00:34:55.429 --> 00:34:57.688
That's what you want.

00:34:57.688 --> 00:34:58.620
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
store it?

00:34:58.620 --> 00:34:59.552
AMELIA SALTSMAN: Pardon?

00:34:59.552 --> 00:35:00.950
AUDIENCE: Any tips
to store it?

00:35:00.950 --> 00:35:02.850
AMELIA SALTSMAN: The question
is how to store them.

00:35:02.850 --> 00:35:05.020
Yes, I do, as a matter
of fact.

00:35:05.020 --> 00:35:08.220
I do have some advice on that.

00:35:08.220 --> 00:35:09.700
So let's see.

00:35:09.700 --> 00:35:15.330
One thing would be with
something like cilantro, just

00:35:15.330 --> 00:35:18.970
put it in-- like store it in a
plastic bag with air inside.

00:35:18.970 --> 00:35:20.670
Trap air inside the bag.

00:35:20.670 --> 00:35:22.930
And then, just keep it
in the refrigerator.

00:35:22.930 --> 00:35:29.500
If you want to put any soft
herbs like parsley

00:35:29.500 --> 00:35:31.910
in water, you can.

00:35:31.910 --> 00:35:33.190
I wouldn't.

00:35:33.190 --> 00:35:37.250
But if you wanted to, then don't
put in the refrigerator.

00:35:37.250 --> 00:35:38.820
Treat it like a vase
of flowers.

00:35:38.820 --> 00:35:42.670
Put it in water and put
it on the counter.

00:35:42.670 --> 00:35:46.400
This, by the way, this is a half
a bunch, a half of bunch.

00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:50.650
So this is $0.50.

00:35:50.650 --> 00:35:54.240
So when you go to the farmers'
market, you get really

00:35:54.240 --> 00:35:56.450
bounteous herbs.

00:35:56.450 --> 00:36:02.090
You also get gorgeous thyme with
its little flowers, which

00:36:02.090 --> 00:36:03.560
goes really nicely with--

00:36:03.560 --> 00:36:05.550
any questions so far?

00:36:05.550 --> 00:36:10.315
Like before we get into
the next dish?

00:36:10.315 --> 00:36:11.840
AUDIENCE: I have a
general question.

00:36:11.840 --> 00:36:12.370
AMELIA SALTSMAN: Yes.

00:36:12.370 --> 00:36:15.793
AUDIENCE: So did you decide
ahead of time what you're

00:36:15.793 --> 00:36:18.238
going to cook, and then go
to the farmers' market?

00:36:18.238 --> 00:36:20.810
AMELIA SALTSMAN: You've just
asked my favorite question.

00:36:20.810 --> 00:36:23.230
The question is, do you decide
ahead of time, and then go to

00:36:23.230 --> 00:36:26.030
the farmers' market or
the other way around?

00:36:26.030 --> 00:36:27.770
It's a little bit of both.

00:36:27.770 --> 00:36:31.800
So one of the things
that you do is you

00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:33.530
need to know the seasons.

00:36:33.530 --> 00:36:37.306
So you'll kind of be thinking,
oh, it's may.

00:36:37.306 --> 00:36:39.640
I'm not going to find eggplant
right now, so I'm not going to

00:36:39.640 --> 00:36:40.950
have in my mind eggplant.

00:36:40.950 --> 00:36:43.270
It's too early for eggplant.

00:36:43.270 --> 00:36:46.360
And you're thinking, well, it's
really time for cherries.

00:36:46.360 --> 00:36:50.570
And by the way, I'm doing a
great cherry almond salad on

00:36:50.570 --> 00:36:54.490
KCRW's "Good Food" this
Saturday at 11:00.

00:36:54.490 --> 00:36:56.510
Really interesting way
of dealing with

00:36:56.510 --> 00:36:58.345
salad and with fruit.

00:37:00.880 --> 00:37:03.030
But I know that it's cherry
season, so I know I'm going to

00:37:03.030 --> 00:37:04.360
focus on cherries.

00:37:04.360 --> 00:37:07.030
Peaches have started to show
up, but it's a little bit

00:37:07.030 --> 00:37:08.830
early for them.

00:37:08.830 --> 00:37:11.480
There's a flavor arc.

00:37:11.480 --> 00:37:14.380
So I like to think about--

00:37:14.380 --> 00:37:17.210
I want to be up here.

00:37:17.210 --> 00:37:20.680
When it's early, flavors
aren't as developed.

00:37:20.680 --> 00:37:22.970
Things might be kind of tart.

00:37:22.970 --> 00:37:25.610
I want to be up here
at the peak.

00:37:25.610 --> 00:37:27.780
And then, of course you get
down to the other side.

00:37:27.780 --> 00:37:29.030
So I'm going to taste
the tomatoes.

00:37:32.620 --> 00:37:35.950
So I'm going to add salt.

00:37:35.950 --> 00:37:37.510
I'm going to add a
little vinegar.

00:37:37.510 --> 00:37:39.760
So it's all by flavor.

00:37:39.760 --> 00:37:43.290
If your tomatoes are very acid,
add a little more sweet,

00:37:43.290 --> 00:37:45.200
like a sweet tomato.

00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:49.220
If they're not acid enough,
add a little vinegar, or a

00:37:49.220 --> 00:37:50.900
little lemon, or
a little lime.

00:37:50.900 --> 00:37:53.660
You could make this Southeast
Asian flavors if you wanted,

00:37:53.660 --> 00:37:59.640
or Mexican, or Italian, or
anything you wanted.

00:37:59.640 --> 00:38:03.890
If it seems too thick,
add some ice cubes.

00:38:03.890 --> 00:38:05.140
Oh, that's tasting good.

00:38:08.130 --> 00:38:09.380
And just chill it.

00:38:15.860 --> 00:38:18.170
The wonderful varieties that
you can get at the farmers'

00:38:18.170 --> 00:38:20.230
market-- this is a Pinkerton.

00:38:20.230 --> 00:38:24.790
And it's a kind of cross between
a Fuerte and a Haas.

00:38:24.790 --> 00:38:34.120
And it has a smaller seed and
a lot of meat in the neck.

00:38:37.480 --> 00:38:39.970
And one of its advantages-- did
you see how I did that?

00:38:39.970 --> 00:38:41.220
Technique--

00:38:42.840 --> 00:38:45.910
is that it holds its shape,
which is nice when you want to

00:38:45.910 --> 00:38:51.550
dice it sort of small
to top our soup.

00:38:55.920 --> 00:38:59.900
And then if you had a reasonably
sized spoon, you

00:38:59.900 --> 00:39:03.780
would just scoop out
all the avocado.

00:39:03.780 --> 00:39:07.720
And voila, you have a lot
of little pieces.

00:39:07.720 --> 00:39:08.350
Here you go.

00:39:08.350 --> 00:39:12.330
So are you getting the idea
of what you want to do?

00:39:12.330 --> 00:39:15.940
And so I know you all
got the books.

00:39:15.940 --> 00:39:19.980
But my book is available
through my website,

00:39:19.980 --> 00:39:21.230
ameliasaltsman.com.

00:39:24.740 --> 00:39:28.990
I blog about all kinds of--

00:39:28.990 --> 00:39:31.250
all the nexi of food.

00:39:31.250 --> 00:39:36.090
Today's blog post that came out,
that went live is sort of

00:39:36.090 --> 00:39:39.750
about LA culinary history, and
sort of the surprises.

00:39:39.750 --> 00:39:42.810
It's like Scripps olive oil.

00:39:42.810 --> 00:39:45.430
You know, Scripps College
produced olive

00:39:45.430 --> 00:39:47.190
oil and they won.

00:39:47.190 --> 00:39:49.890
They won the international
tasting thing.

00:39:52.480 --> 00:39:56.055
But we've been making olive oil
in Los Angeles for over a

00:39:56.055 --> 00:39:58.192
hundred years, but nobody
knows that.

00:39:58.192 --> 00:39:59.890
So check it out.

00:40:02.600 --> 00:40:04.350
So salad.

00:40:04.350 --> 00:40:07.690
What we've got are
some incredible,

00:40:07.690 --> 00:40:09.090
beautiful salad greens.

00:40:09.090 --> 00:40:11.900
I think you get stuff
from Maggie's Farm.

00:40:11.900 --> 00:40:12.800
A beautiful mix.

00:40:12.800 --> 00:40:14.250
They call this the
charger mix.

00:40:14.250 --> 00:40:16.610
And so it's got a lot of
different flavors.

00:40:16.610 --> 00:40:18.730
It's got slightly
bitter Frisee.

00:40:18.730 --> 00:40:19.910
It's one of the chicories.

00:40:19.910 --> 00:40:23.220
It's got radicchio.

00:40:23.220 --> 00:40:26.810
It's got this gorgeous
little gems.

00:40:26.810 --> 00:40:29.980
So again, texture.

00:40:29.980 --> 00:40:33.400
I thought maybe we would do
fennel in this salad.

00:40:33.400 --> 00:40:36.884
Are you all familiar
with fennel?

00:40:36.884 --> 00:40:38.134
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:40:40.260 --> 00:40:41.690
AMELIA SALTSMAN: Oh, she's
making a face.

00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:45.980
OK.

00:40:45.980 --> 00:40:50.050
You're used to like fennel
seeds in sausage?

00:40:50.050 --> 00:40:52.030
OK, but this is the
fennel bulb.

00:40:52.030 --> 00:40:56.110
This is a female one because you
can see how round it is.

00:40:56.110 --> 00:40:58.196
The male ones are
kind of flat.

00:40:58.196 --> 00:40:59.740
Sorry, guys.

00:40:59.740 --> 00:41:02.880
But you just want to-- and
you like it when it comes

00:41:02.880 --> 00:41:04.130
with the tops on.

00:41:08.010 --> 00:41:12.810
And you take off the rough
outer portion.

00:41:16.180 --> 00:41:18.030
And did you notice
I left a handle?

00:41:20.530 --> 00:41:27.810
Now, you can use
this part for--

00:41:27.810 --> 00:41:31.210
you can use the fronds, they
taste a little bit anise.

00:41:31.210 --> 00:41:32.450
You could use that
in the salad.

00:41:32.450 --> 00:41:35.585
You could use that wrapped
around fish

00:41:35.585 --> 00:41:38.060
would be very nice.

00:41:38.060 --> 00:41:45.420
But one thing that's really nice
and quick is to shave--

00:41:45.420 --> 00:41:48.430
to get different shapes,
different textures.

00:41:48.430 --> 00:41:52.150
So fennel is a little bit sweet,
but I think it makes a

00:41:52.150 --> 00:41:56.820
beautiful shaved element.

00:41:56.820 --> 00:41:58.160
And that goes pretty fast.

00:41:58.160 --> 00:42:00.710
And look how I'm protecting
my fingers-- multitasking

00:42:00.710 --> 00:42:02.100
vegetables.

00:42:02.100 --> 00:42:03.390
And then you get this.

00:42:03.390 --> 00:42:06.200
Now, you can have a salad just
of the fennel with a little

00:42:06.200 --> 00:42:11.445
olive oil or walnut oil
and salt and pepper.

00:42:11.445 --> 00:42:15.090
But we're putting it together
with the greens.

00:42:15.090 --> 00:42:18.265
You could put it--

00:42:18.265 --> 00:42:19.500
there we go.

00:42:19.500 --> 00:42:22.400
And spring is radish time.

00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:24.940
So this is the late
spring salad.

00:42:24.940 --> 00:42:28.270
You notice that the tomatoes
aren't going in the salad

00:42:28.270 --> 00:42:31.380
because there's a lot more to
salad than tomatoes, lettuce,

00:42:31.380 --> 00:42:34.710
and cucumber.

00:42:34.710 --> 00:42:37.160
OK?

00:42:37.160 --> 00:42:39.480
And so now we've got all
these beautiful colors.

00:42:39.480 --> 00:42:41.700
We could add fruit to it.

00:42:41.700 --> 00:42:46.730
We could add cherries to it, but
I think I would probably

00:42:46.730 --> 00:42:47.590
add to this salad--

00:42:47.590 --> 00:42:50.420
I would probably add
some citrus.

00:42:50.420 --> 00:42:53.935
And for a change of pace, do
we have any nut allergies?

00:42:53.935 --> 00:42:55.170
No, we're good?

00:42:55.170 --> 00:42:57.565
Walnut oil, really nice
with a salad.

00:42:57.565 --> 00:43:02.200
It's a good dressing oil.

00:43:02.200 --> 00:43:07.430
This is a really nice oil made
by a walnut producer.

00:43:07.430 --> 00:43:10.210
Toss the salad right
in the bowl.

00:43:10.210 --> 00:43:12.145
OK, no extra dish.

00:43:12.145 --> 00:43:13.400
We'll use our crunchy salt.

00:43:16.475 --> 00:43:20.184
Do you see how I'm
crushing it?

00:43:20.184 --> 00:43:22.850
A little pepper, black pepper.

00:43:22.850 --> 00:43:25.650
Optional.

00:43:25.650 --> 00:43:29.430
And let's use some more of that
lemon since we've got it.

00:43:33.260 --> 00:43:34.360
Nice squeeze.

00:43:34.360 --> 00:43:37.440
And toss the salad.

00:43:46.880 --> 00:43:51.270
Now, if you had two minutes
to make a salad,

00:43:51.270 --> 00:43:53.650
what would you use?

00:43:53.650 --> 00:43:54.676
Yes?

00:43:54.676 --> 00:43:57.880
AUDIENCE: I would use the greens
and the radishes and

00:43:57.880 --> 00:43:59.780
yogurt [INAUDIBLE].

00:43:59.780 --> 00:44:01.070
AMELIA SALTSMAN: OK,
that sounds great.

00:44:01.070 --> 00:44:04.130
She says she'll dress
it with yogurt.

00:44:04.130 --> 00:44:06.900
So that would be great.

00:44:06.900 --> 00:44:09.080
If I had two minutes, I'd
probably just use the

00:44:09.080 --> 00:44:13.260
lettuces, a little bit of oil,
a little salt, maybe

00:44:13.260 --> 00:44:14.190
a squeeze of lemon.

00:44:14.190 --> 00:44:16.840
If the greens are delicious, I
don't even need the lemon.

00:44:16.840 --> 00:44:19.190
And the oil is delicious.

00:44:19.190 --> 00:44:20.735
And there is a beautiful
salad.

00:44:25.840 --> 00:44:30.040
And then, it looks beautiful
mounded on a platter, right?

00:44:32.806 --> 00:44:33.728
What do you think?

00:44:33.728 --> 00:44:34.650
Good?

00:44:34.650 --> 00:44:38.640
AUDIENCE: I'm getting ideas
for my Thanksgiving table.

00:44:38.640 --> 00:44:40.130
AMELIA SALTSMAN: Oh,
different season.

00:44:40.130 --> 00:44:43.000
We'll have to do this again with
a whole different set of

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:44.155
ingredients.

00:44:44.155 --> 00:44:46.420
Well, let's take a look
at the asparagus.

00:44:46.420 --> 00:44:51.176
So I wanted to show you
purple asparagus.

00:45:01.490 --> 00:45:02.680
Beautiful, right?

00:45:02.680 --> 00:45:04.760
When you cut into it--

00:45:04.760 --> 00:45:08.080
so I cut them to show you
how beautiful it is.

00:45:08.080 --> 00:45:10.810
When you cook them, this purple
asparagus season's

00:45:10.810 --> 00:45:12.320
almost over.

00:45:12.320 --> 00:45:16.960
But it cooks up, it loses the
purple, but it's like a deep,

00:45:16.960 --> 00:45:18.150
deep green.

00:45:18.150 --> 00:45:19.780
And it's really sweet.

00:45:19.780 --> 00:45:21.030
Do you all like asparagus?

00:45:23.340 --> 00:45:24.380
OK.

00:45:24.380 --> 00:45:29.120
So another cooking technique,
you can just, almost like stir

00:45:29.120 --> 00:45:32.720
fry asparagus in this way.

00:45:32.720 --> 00:45:36.010
If the asparagus were whole, you
could roast it or grill it

00:45:36.010 --> 00:45:38.800
the way we did.

00:45:38.800 --> 00:45:40.050
That's the smallest one?

00:45:44.210 --> 00:45:47.380
And asparagus goes really
nicely with butter.

00:45:47.380 --> 00:45:50.390
So if you use butter, you
could cook it in butter.

00:45:50.390 --> 00:45:53.210
If you didn't, you could
cook it in avocado oil,

00:45:53.210 --> 00:45:54.460
which would be great.

00:45:57.140 --> 00:46:00.530
And if you wanted to make an
entire dinner in about 10

00:46:00.530 --> 00:46:07.620
minutes, what I would do and
have done plenty of times is

00:46:07.620 --> 00:46:08.390
I'll cook up asparagus.

00:46:08.390 --> 00:46:10.470
I won't even go to the trouble
of cutting it into pretty

00:46:10.470 --> 00:46:16.510
pieces, push it aside, crack
open a couple of eggs.

00:46:16.510 --> 00:46:19.050
And when it's done, shave--

00:46:19.050 --> 00:46:24.040
use a vegetable peeler
and shave big

00:46:24.040 --> 00:46:26.550
shavings of Parmesan cheese.

00:46:26.550 --> 00:46:26.920
Dinner.

00:46:26.920 --> 00:46:28.310
It's good.

00:46:28.310 --> 00:46:29.770
All I'm saying.

00:46:29.770 --> 00:46:30.356
It's really good.

00:46:30.356 --> 00:46:33.670
If the eggs are great and if
the asparagus is delicious.

00:46:38.670 --> 00:46:41.140
Put your hand over--

00:46:41.140 --> 00:46:42.600
how fast does it gets hot?

00:46:42.600 --> 00:46:43.870
That's what you want to know.

00:46:43.870 --> 00:46:45.250
Not hot enough.

00:46:45.250 --> 00:46:46.300
Any more questions?

00:46:46.300 --> 00:46:48.990
Anything you would like to
know about shopping in

00:46:48.990 --> 00:46:53.740
farmers' markets, about how
to choose, about how to--

00:46:53.740 --> 00:46:56.220
any ingredients we haven't
covered that you'd really like

00:46:56.220 --> 00:46:57.280
to know about?

00:46:57.280 --> 00:46:58.856
Julie.

00:46:58.856 --> 00:47:00.664
AUDIENCE: Are there other
markets you recommend besides

00:47:00.664 --> 00:47:01.570
Santa Monica?

00:47:01.570 --> 00:47:04.190
AMELIA SALTSMAN: What markets
do I recommend besides Santa

00:47:04.190 --> 00:47:05.440
Monica Farmers' Market?

00:47:07.860 --> 00:47:09.740
The Venice Friday morning
market is a

00:47:09.740 --> 00:47:11.250
really nice little market.

00:47:11.250 --> 00:47:15.530
They really have-- it's small,
but it's choice.

00:47:15.530 --> 00:47:20.060
The Sunday Mar Vista Market
is a fabulous market.

00:47:20.060 --> 00:47:23.550
The Beverly Hills Sunday
Market, also excellent.

00:47:23.550 --> 00:47:27.550
I'm trying to think what else
is on the West Side?

00:47:27.550 --> 00:47:28.090
Santa Monica.

00:47:28.090 --> 00:47:33.050
And then, there are four Santa
Monica markets, right?

00:47:33.050 --> 00:47:35.310
And the one on Wednesday
is the largest.

00:47:35.310 --> 00:47:36.660
It's one of the largest
in the country.

00:47:40.550 --> 00:47:42.440
So we just want that to
cook really quickly.

00:47:46.648 --> 00:47:48.314
AUDIENCE: So your recommendation
is the South

00:47:48.314 --> 00:47:49.504
Bay market?

00:47:49.504 --> 00:47:51.322
AMELIA SALTSMAN:
The South Bay--

00:47:51.322 --> 00:47:53.420
the Torrence Market is great.

00:47:53.420 --> 00:47:55.726
That's the jewel in the
crown for Torrence,

00:47:55.726 --> 00:47:58.320
for the South Bay.

00:47:58.320 --> 00:48:08.641
There's also now a market
in Playa Vista.

00:48:08.641 --> 00:48:12.690
So I threw in a little
whole thyme sprigs.

00:48:12.690 --> 00:48:13.610
Can you smell that?

00:48:13.610 --> 00:48:14.935
Do you want to pass
that around?

00:48:14.935 --> 00:48:16.120
It's really delicious.

00:48:16.120 --> 00:48:19.550
AUDIENCE: Do you ever wash
rosemary and thyme?

00:48:19.550 --> 00:48:20.820
AMELIA SALTSMAN: Do I wash it?

00:48:20.820 --> 00:48:24.292
If it's dirty.

00:48:24.292 --> 00:48:25.780
Touch it.

00:48:25.780 --> 00:48:28.890
But yeah, you can just
give it a rinse.

00:48:28.890 --> 00:48:30.930
Now, one of the things that I
wanted to say about-- we were

00:48:30.930 --> 00:48:33.890
talking about storing herbs.

00:48:33.890 --> 00:48:42.090
So when you have a woody herb,
like thyme or rosemary, just

00:48:42.090 --> 00:48:44.830
keep them on the counter and
they will dry naturally.

00:48:44.830 --> 00:48:46.180
And then they'll be like
having dried herbs.

00:48:51.140 --> 00:48:54.470
So for our last little trick--

00:48:54.470 --> 00:48:56.820
oh, and I made you a little
cauliflower salad, too.

00:48:56.820 --> 00:49:00.780
So for my last little trick, I
want to show you how to cut an

00:49:00.780 --> 00:49:11.040
orange so that you get
beautiful slices.

00:49:11.040 --> 00:49:14.000
Top and bottom off.

00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:21.745
Shave the sides to expose
the back of the pulp.

00:49:30.530 --> 00:49:32.885
Turn it, finish the job.

00:49:36.210 --> 00:49:40.030
Now, this is if you're in the
mood to do something pretty.

00:49:40.030 --> 00:49:42.260
If you're not in the mood to do
something pretty but you're

00:49:42.260 --> 00:49:44.440
wondering how they do something

00:49:44.440 --> 00:49:45.690
pretty, this is the way.

00:49:48.610 --> 00:49:52.390
This technique also works well
for melons when you get--

00:49:55.450 --> 00:49:56.840
obviously, you're not
going to segment it.

00:49:56.840 --> 00:50:00.740
But if you take the melon, cut
off the top, cut off the

00:50:00.740 --> 00:50:05.890
bottom, and go, then it's a lot
faster than cutting a lot

00:50:05.890 --> 00:50:08.110
of little wedges.

00:50:08.110 --> 00:50:12.540
OK, now what I have--

00:50:12.540 --> 00:50:15.940
let's add it right
to our salad.

00:50:15.940 --> 00:50:17.190
What do you think?

00:50:21.530 --> 00:50:22.780
Just cut between
the membranes.

00:50:26.210 --> 00:50:28.790
And there you go.

00:50:28.790 --> 00:50:30.873
Beautiful little segments
of orange.

00:50:33.484 --> 00:50:34.420
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:50:34.420 --> 00:50:35.500
AMELIA SALTSMAN: I'm sorry,
I couldn't hear you.

00:50:35.500 --> 00:50:38.450
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:50:38.450 --> 00:50:39.560
AMELIA SALTSMAN: OK,
good question.

00:50:39.560 --> 00:50:40.800
What kind of orange is this?

00:50:40.800 --> 00:50:43.020
This is a Navel orange.

00:50:43.020 --> 00:50:46.460
The Navel season is
just beginning.

00:50:46.460 --> 00:50:49.880
And actually, this is a
Washington Navel, which is the

00:50:49.880 --> 00:50:54.700
first Navel orange to
come to California.

00:50:54.700 --> 00:50:59.440
And this is what made California
famous for oranges.

00:50:59.440 --> 00:51:06.070
And we just are finishing
Valencias, which have seeds,

00:51:06.070 --> 00:51:08.230
but have a lot of juice.

00:51:08.230 --> 00:51:11.120
Although, this isn't too bad.

00:51:11.120 --> 00:51:13.055
Now, do you see I'm getting
like a book of membranes?

00:51:16.520 --> 00:51:20.460
And then when you get all the
way through, you can just--

00:51:20.460 --> 00:51:23.445
we'll just squeeze the orange
juice right on top.

00:51:23.445 --> 00:51:26.470
All right, any other
questions?

00:51:26.470 --> 00:51:27.849
Yes.

00:51:27.849 --> 00:51:30.783
AUDIENCE: So I guess this
is a loaded question.

00:51:30.783 --> 00:51:35.673
But what would you prefer,
buying not organic at the

00:51:35.673 --> 00:51:40.570
farmers' market or going to a
store for organic [INAUDIBLE]?

00:51:40.570 --> 00:51:42.510
AMELIA SALTSMAN: So the question
is about organics.

00:51:48.230 --> 00:51:50.410
This is what I like to do.

00:51:50.410 --> 00:51:55.350
So when something is certified
organic, it just means one

00:51:55.350 --> 00:52:00.730
simple thing, which is that the
farmer has complied with a

00:52:00.730 --> 00:52:05.680
certain level of growing
practices.

00:52:05.680 --> 00:52:09.850
Many farmers who aren't
certified organic farm at a

00:52:09.850 --> 00:52:15.830
much higher level of sustainable
farming practice.

00:52:15.830 --> 00:52:19.570
Well, that just makes it a
little bit difficult, right?

00:52:19.570 --> 00:52:21.930
For the consumer.

00:52:21.930 --> 00:52:24.970
So for me, I do the following.

00:52:24.970 --> 00:52:27.190
Number one is that I
start shopping and

00:52:27.190 --> 00:52:29.680
engaging the farmer.

00:52:29.680 --> 00:52:34.710
And the easiest way to know what
a farmer is like and how

00:52:34.710 --> 00:52:37.610
he or she grows is-- we're
coming right back to the

00:52:37.610 --> 00:52:38.600
beginning--

00:52:38.600 --> 00:52:40.130
flavor.

00:52:40.130 --> 00:52:43.470
It's really hard to grow
for flavor first.

00:52:43.470 --> 00:52:50.410
So anybody who does that has to
have really good practices.

00:52:50.410 --> 00:52:51.520
It is a guarantee?

00:52:51.520 --> 00:52:52.370
No.

00:52:52.370 --> 00:52:56.540
But you have to grow
the soil first.

00:52:56.540 --> 00:53:00.890
So you have to be a dedicated
farmer who really is nurturing

00:53:00.890 --> 00:53:02.660
and nourishing the soil.

00:53:02.660 --> 00:53:03.870
Terroir--

00:53:03.870 --> 00:53:07.400
It's about what the soil gives
to the food, not just wine,

00:53:07.400 --> 00:53:10.090
anything that grows
in the ground.

00:53:10.090 --> 00:53:13.840
So it influences how
our food tastes.

00:53:13.840 --> 00:53:21.340
If you choose a variety that
its marker is flavor as

00:53:21.340 --> 00:53:28.660
opposed to shipability or
storage or perfection, it may

00:53:28.660 --> 00:53:30.110
not be the easiest
thing to grow.

00:53:30.110 --> 00:53:32.820
But if you care enough, you're
going to grow for flavor.

00:53:32.820 --> 00:53:34.470
You're going to choose that
variety because you're a

00:53:34.470 --> 00:53:37.160
really proud and passionate
grower.

00:53:37.160 --> 00:53:43.690
And the other thing is that if
you grow for flavor, you are

00:53:43.690 --> 00:53:45.470
going to wait till
the last minute.

00:53:45.470 --> 00:53:48.830
You saw how juicy
that orange was.

00:53:48.830 --> 00:53:54.370
That orange is stored on the
tree, not in a shed.

00:53:54.370 --> 00:53:58.160
The months that it stays after
its first beginning-- remember

00:53:58.160 --> 00:54:01.520
that arc over here?

00:54:01.520 --> 00:54:05.670
It's just continuing to gain
flavor from the warm sun and

00:54:05.670 --> 00:54:08.250
then the cold nights, which
gives us really good contrast.

00:54:08.250 --> 00:54:11.855
That's why we have such amazing
produce in California,

00:54:11.855 --> 00:54:14.990
it's that Mediterranean
climate.

00:54:14.990 --> 00:54:18.600
So I go by flavor.

00:54:18.600 --> 00:54:22.480
And then I ask questions.

00:54:22.480 --> 00:54:26.630
So for me, that's how
I make my decision.

00:54:26.630 --> 00:54:30.390
If I were at a supermarket, I
would probably just make sure

00:54:30.390 --> 00:54:32.830
that I was buying organic
because that's the only

00:54:32.830 --> 00:54:34.180
touchstone I would have.

00:54:34.180 --> 00:54:38.790
That's the only guide
I would have.

00:54:38.790 --> 00:54:44.596
But my preference would be to
buy from growers that I know.

00:54:44.596 --> 00:54:47.810
Did I answer your question
in full?

00:54:47.810 --> 00:54:49.060
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:54:50.800 --> 00:54:52.230
AMELIA SALTSMAN: When it's
grown locally, it

00:54:52.230 --> 00:54:54.540
means it's in season.

00:54:54.540 --> 00:54:55.990
So it's easy.

00:54:55.990 --> 00:54:58.540
If it has good flavor, it's
going to tend to be good for

00:54:58.540 --> 00:55:00.930
you, well grown, good
for the planet.

00:55:00.930 --> 00:55:03.900
So it's not that hard to
do all the things we

00:55:03.900 --> 00:55:06.590
really want to do.

00:55:06.590 --> 00:55:08.400
I'll just close with this--

00:55:08.400 --> 00:55:12.540
the most important thing we can
do for ourselves and the

00:55:12.540 --> 00:55:21.080
planet is to cook from scratch
from well-grown ingredients.

00:55:21.080 --> 00:55:24.850
If we cook for ourselves,
we will be healthier.

00:55:24.850 --> 00:55:28.150
And if we cook with good
ingredients, the planet will

00:55:28.150 --> 00:55:29.830
be healthier.

00:55:29.830 --> 00:55:32.590
So that's what it takes.

00:55:32.590 --> 00:55:33.663
Thank you.

00:55:33.663 --> 00:55:35.595
[APPLAUSE]

00:55:35.595 --> 00:55:38.500
AMELIA SALTSMAN: So I hope
you'll come and taste.

00:55:38.500 --> 00:55:43.700
And I'd be happy to sign your
books if you would like.

00:55:43.700 --> 00:55:48.400
In the side dish section,
there's a whole primer for

00:55:48.400 --> 00:55:49.620
roasting vegetables--

00:55:49.620 --> 00:55:53.190
what temperature, how long,
whether you need to

00:55:53.190 --> 00:55:54.280
blanch it or not.

00:55:54.280 --> 00:55:55.540
So it's a whole guide.

00:55:55.540 --> 00:55:58.940
Because really, it's all about
a little olive oil, a little

00:55:58.940 --> 00:55:59.970
salt, and a sheet pan.

00:55:59.970 --> 00:56:02.340
You are good to go.

00:56:02.340 --> 00:56:04.140
That is life's answer.
