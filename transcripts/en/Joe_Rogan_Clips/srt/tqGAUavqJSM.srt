1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:04,800
The Joe Rogan experience is,
is the end.

2
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:06,420
The way things operate

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:12,190
is not something that's far from optimal.
It's something,

4
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:16,180
it's not something that
sucks but it is very,

5
00:00:16,330 --> 00:00:17,400
is very good,

6
00:00:17,401 --> 00:00:22,401
very optimal heart to beat in the
sense that the like for example,

7
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:23,753
mortality,

8
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,650
right eye is death important for creation,

9
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:33,480
for, for his death. Important
for us. Human beings for life,

10
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:37,770
for us as a society is important for us
to die. Like if you could live forever,

11
00:00:37,771 --> 00:00:38,640
would you live forever?

12
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:43,350
I think miss out on the possibility
that there is something,

13
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:46,470
well I had this conversation with CT
Fletcher yesterday cause you know he

14
00:00:46,471 --> 00:00:51,000
survived the heart transplant a year ago.
You're in two days ago. I think it's,

15
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:53,543
what do you think?

16
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:59,420
I think I think mortality
is essential for everything.

17
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:05,150
So I think the end, we need
the end to be there. Right.

18
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:09,050
But do you think that we need the end to
be there for the overall health of the

19
00:01:09,051 --> 00:01:14,051
human race or the or the all the organisms
on earth or do you think we needed to

20
00:01:14,961 --> 00:01:17,270
be there because there's something else?

21
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:20,450
Do you think there's something else
that happens to you when your body stops

22
00:01:20,451 --> 00:01:24,890
existing? Do you think your consciousness
transcends this, this dimension?

23
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:26,550
I think,
uh,

24
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:31,680
I think I'm not smart enough
to even think about that.

25
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:32,760
That's a great answer.

26
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:37,740
So I think everybody on earth has that
exact same answer if they're being honest.

27
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:40,770
So you're talking about atheism and so on.

28
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:44,840
I used to think atheism
means what I just said. So,

29
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:49,710
but it's more we know so little.
Uh,

30
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:54,240
so the, the only thing I know is
that the finiteness of life is, uh,

31
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:58,180
the Broadway, just a school that train,
that has this poster at the, at the,

32
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:02,850
at the opening, which is a hunter
s Thompson quote, which is, um,

33
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:08,190
uh, for about skidding into death
sideways. No one's a good one.

34
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:13,350
Uh, no for all moments of beauty.
Many souls must be trampled,

35
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:19,890
something like that. That's a fucking
great quote. God, I love that guy. Yeah.

36
00:02:19,891 --> 00:02:23,970
So basically for beauty,
you have to have suffering.

37
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:29,010
I do not disagree with you. I do not
disagree with any of the things you said.

38
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:34,280
And I think there's always a possibility
that human beings are the most advanced

39
00:02:35,081 --> 00:02:38,680
life form that's ever existed in
the cosmos. There's always that.

40
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:42,100
That has to be an option if we are here,
right?

41
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:44,200
If we can't see any others out there,

42
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:47,440
and even though you know there's the
Fermi paradox and there's all this

43
00:02:47,441 --> 00:02:49,480
contemplation that if they do exist,

44
00:02:49,481 --> 00:02:53,800
like maybe they can't physically get
to us or maybe they're on a similar

45
00:02:53,801 --> 00:02:57,460
timeline to us and they're also,

46
00:02:57,550 --> 00:03:00,490
it's also possible as as it might sound,

47
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:04,030
that this is as good as it's ever gotten
anywhere in the world or anywhere in

48
00:03:04,031 --> 00:03:04,481
the universe,

49
00:03:04,481 --> 00:03:08,560
rather that human beings right now in
2019 or as good as the whole universe has

50
00:03:08,561 --> 00:03:09,394
ever produced,

51
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:13,180
we're just some freak luck accident and
everybody else is throwing shit at each

52
00:03:13,181 --> 00:03:14,080
other,
right?

53
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,730
There's 15 arm caterpillar people that
live on some other fucking planet.

54
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:19,880
They just tossed her own shit at
each other and they never get any,

55
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:24,040
they never get any work done.
But we might be that.

56
00:03:24,041 --> 00:03:25,240
But even if that's true,

57
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:32,030
even if this beauty that we perceive,
even if that,

58
00:03:32,031 --> 00:03:37,031
that this beauty requires
evil to battle and requires,

59
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:43,300
are seemingly insurmountable
obstacles you have to overcome.

60
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,610
And that through this you see,
achieve great beauty.

61
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:50,530
That beauty is in the eye of the
beholder. For sure. Objectively,

62
00:03:50,531 --> 00:03:53,300
the universe doesn't give
a fuck if rocky pizza,

63
00:03:53,301 --> 00:03:56,800
Apollo creed in the second movie,
it doesn't give a fuck.

64
00:03:57,190 --> 00:04:00,460
It's nonsense to
everything's nonsense too.

65
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:03,880
And when you look at the giant
ass picture of what beauty is,

66
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:07,780
if the sun's going to burn out in 5
billion years, what beauty is that?

67
00:04:07,781 --> 00:04:12,590
If there could be a hyper Nova
next door that just cooks us. Ugh.

68
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:17,560
So that's like the book sapiens.
Uh, yeah. That basically,

69
00:04:17,561 --> 00:04:18,394
we've all,

70
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:23,640
one of the things we've created here is
we've imagined ideas that we all share

71
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:28,210
ideas of beauty, ideas of
truth, ideas of fairness.

72
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:32,980
We've all created together. And it
doesn't exist outside of us as a society.

73
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:37,840
And no, it only exists to us.
Yeah. To us it does exist.

74
00:04:37,841 --> 00:04:41,620
And this is where I think the
beauty of being a person truly lies.

75
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:45,760
It lies in us,
our appreciation of us.

76
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:51,100
We appreciate people in a profound way.
Like we were talking about Hendrix,

77
00:04:51,101 --> 00:04:51,400
I probably,

78
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:54,790
I don't know how many hours of Hendricks
I've ever listened to or Richard Pryor,

79
00:04:55,330 --> 00:05:00,330
how many hours of Richard Pryor I watched
and how much that affected me as a kid

80
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:04,930
watching live in the sunset strip. That's
what got me to do in stand up comedy.

81
00:05:04,931 --> 00:05:06,070
We affect each other.

82
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:10,090
A Ct Fletcher who was on the podcast
yesterday who's just incredibly

83
00:05:10,091 --> 00:05:12,040
inspirational guy,
you watch his videos,

84
00:05:12,041 --> 00:05:16,840
you want to lift the fucking
world and throw it into
space, you know? I mean he's,

85
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:20,410
he's so powerful.
We appreciate each other.

86
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:24,730
We appreciate people. So all those
things you're saying are real.

87
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:27,070
Like for us, they're real. For us,

88
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:31,510
my concern is not that my
concern is that we are outdated.

89
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:36,580
My concern is not that there's not
beauty in what we are. I'm a, I'm a,

90
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:39,850
I am big appreciator of this life.

91
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:44,810
I appreciate human beings in this life
and human beings. Their contributions as,

92
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:48,610
as a and as I get older, like
particularly like over the last few years.

93
00:05:48,611 --> 00:05:50,950
I just started doing a lot
of international travel.

94
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:55,300
I fucking appreciate the shit of all
these people that are living in this

95
00:05:55,301 --> 00:06:00,301
different way with weird and shit and
weird smell and foods and I like to think

96
00:06:01,071 --> 00:06:03,070
like what would it be
like if I grew up here?

97
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:07,460
Like these are just people but they're
in this weird sort of mode. You know?

98
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:12,490
I think we're insanely lucky that we have
this enthusiasm for each other that we

99
00:06:13,881 --> 00:06:15,770
have this into like for your work man,

100
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:19,940
I have this deep enthusiasm for
what you do. I'm fascinated by it.

101
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:24,260
I love being able to talk to you and pick
your mind about like you're out there

102
00:06:24,261 --> 00:06:27,560
coding these fucking vehicles
that are driving themselves,

103
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:30,380
artificial life on wheels.

104
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:34,190
I don't think any other animal
appreciates each other the way people do.

105
00:06:34,191 --> 00:06:36,470
I mean I might be wrong.
People do, right? Yeah.

106
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:39,620
I might be wrong about dolphins and whales
mean maybe they love each other just

107
00:06:39,621 --> 00:06:43,430
as much as we do just in a different way.
But what,

108
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:47,930
where does AI fit into that?
So your worry,

109
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:51,740
I'm worried that we are Australia peer
thickest and AI is going to come along

110
00:06:51,741 --> 00:06:52,760
and make us look stupid.

111
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:55,790
The only reason why I was trying to
pick Australia pithy would be cool.

112
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:59,750
Today's we found a gang of, I'm on an
island somewhere. We were like, Holy Shit.

113
00:06:59,751 --> 00:07:02,060
They survived.
They never evolved.

114
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:05,060
They're on this island just cracking
coconuts and just eating fish,

115
00:07:05,061 --> 00:07:07,550
whatever they can catch,
that would be amazing.

116
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:12,230
But everyone documented or undisclosed
discovered uncontacted tribe,

117
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:16,340
they're all homo sapiens, all
of them. So it's like, you know.
