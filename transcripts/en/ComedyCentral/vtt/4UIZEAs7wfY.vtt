00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:04.060
Slurpee just turned fifty years.

00:00:04.103 --> 00:00:06.739
Fuck yeah, we did it.

00:00:06.772 --> 00:00:10.777
USA.
We're not all bad.

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:12.612
And I don't know if you guys
celebrated the way I did,

00:00:12.645 --> 00:00:16.315
but that weekend around
the Slurpee's original birthdate

00:00:16.348 --> 00:00:18.818
7-Eleven had an amazing
promotion going on.

00:00:18.851 --> 00:00:23.122
You go into any 7-Eleven,
pay $1.50,

00:00:23.155 --> 00:00:26.292
and bring in the container
of your choice

00:00:26.325 --> 00:00:29.362
and fill it up
with Slurpee.

00:00:29.395 --> 00:00:34.400
And America fucking responded.

00:00:34.433 --> 00:00:37.336
People were bringing in,
like, kiddie pools,

00:00:37.369 --> 00:00:40.473
trash bags,
Deep Rock jugs of water.

00:00:40.506 --> 00:00:42.642
We went nuts.

00:00:42.675 --> 00:00:45.378
Here's what I did.
I day drank. I got hammered.

00:00:45.411 --> 00:00:46.712
I walked in there
about 1:00 a.m.,

00:00:46.745 --> 00:00:48.815
confidently strode
to the register,

00:00:48.848 --> 00:00:53.486
and I was, like,
"One pack of Magnum condoms,
please, sir."

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:55.088
He slid the condoms
across the register,

00:00:55.121 --> 00:00:56.522
I unwrapped them
out of the cellophane,

00:00:56.555 --> 00:00:58.758
and then I just beelined over
to the Slurpee machine.

00:00:58.791 --> 00:01:01.594
Just went right up to it.

00:01:01.627 --> 00:01:05.698
Just proceeded to fill up
12 Magnum balloons

00:01:05.731 --> 00:01:09.335
full of Slurpee,
one after another.

00:01:09.368 --> 00:01:11.337
Tied 'em all up,
scooped 'em up in my arms,

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:14.274
and I was like,
"See you at the centennial,
dipshits."
