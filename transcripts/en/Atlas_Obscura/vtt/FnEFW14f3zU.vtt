00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:15.080
- I never get tired of
the reaction of people

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:15.920
who say, "Oh,

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:19.430
1543, it's amazing that
this book was published

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:22.650
in 1543, and that I can
actually touch paper

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.140
from the 16th century,

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:26.980
and touch illustrations that were created

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:29.773
by someone who lived in the 16th century.

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:32.100
I'm Anne Garner,

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:34.220
I'm a curator of rare
books and manuscripts

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:36.380
here at the New York Academy of Medicine

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:37.690
in New York City.

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:40.290
Today we're looking at Andreas Vesalius's

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.680
De humani corporis fabrica,

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.550
arguably the most important book published

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:47.400
in the 16th century.

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:51.520
This copy of the 1543 Vesalius

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.320
has all of the marks of wear

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.610
of a 16th-century book.

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:58.130
This is a book made during
the hand-press period,

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:01.360
so each copy is unique.

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:05.840
Right away, we notice
that Vesalius is looking

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.180
at the reader and actually
handling the body,

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.180
the cadaver itself.

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:14.480
He is making a deliberate point that

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:16.330
in order to know the body,

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:18.460
you have to actually touch

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:22.530
and look at and investigate
the body directly.

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.250
These bodies are extremely accurate

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.230
in a way that has never happened before

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:34.230
because he's actually
doing dissections himself.

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.760
One of the things that
Vesalius likes to do

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:41.520
is he shows you the body
in different stages of

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.530
flaying or dissection.

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.550
He's making a direct
reference to the way that

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:49.870
bodies were acquired.

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:52.370
Italy had strict rules about

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:53.530
the kinds of bodies that

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.130
you could use for dissection.

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.520
These were mostly church laws

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.670
and Vesalius got most of his bodies

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:03.660
from executed criminals.

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:08.163
So here you have that
illustrated literally.

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.530
So it is possible to make an appointment

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.320
and come see this book
and actually handle it

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.800
and look at the woodcut images up close

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.822
and read what Vesalius
said about the body.
