00:00:00.299 --> 00:00:04.460
If you think back to the last time you were
in pain, your reaction might have been something

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:05.320
like this.

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:06.940
*Bleep*

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:08.540
*Bleep* *Bleep*

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:09.260
*Bleep*

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:13.580
Swearing in response to painful stimuli is
a pretty common human behaviour

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.600
but for a long time psychologists thought
it was a bad idea.

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:19.230
That swearing puts you in a negative state
of mind

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.720
and makes you think you're in a worse situation
than you actually are.

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:25.300
Something called - catastrophising.

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:29.579
To test this, back in 2009, researchers at
the university of Keele

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:30.900
came up with an experiment.

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:34.160
You fill up a bucket with ice cold water,

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.100
ask people to put their hands in it

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.300
and see how long they can withstand the pain.

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:39.820
Woookay.

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.840
We decided to re-create this experiment very
rigorously

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.480
with a self selecting sample of paid junkies
here at the Ri.

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:50.700
Woo!

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.840
In one condition you let the person use a
swearword.

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:54.840
Probably *bleep*.

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:55.840
It's probably *bleep*

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:56.340
*Bleep*

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:57.640
I'll probably go you *bleep*

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:00.220
And in the other they say a neutral word.

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:01.120
Wood.

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:02.260
Legs.

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:08.220
The authors hypothesized that swearing would
make the pain worse.

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.240
Because of the catastrophising effect.

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.680
But as you can see, what they found, was quite
the opposite.

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:15.960
I can't do it.

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:17.480
I can't.

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.840
*BLEEP* [Laughter off camera]

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.840
Flat. Flat. *Bleep*

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:26.420
*Bleep*

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:27.400
*Bleep*

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:28.480
*Bleep*

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:29.700
*Bleep*

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:30.540
*Bleep*

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.240
That was much worse.

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:35.460
*Bleep*

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:37.280
Legs. Woah.

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:38.060
*Bleep*

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:49.720
Hard. *Bleep* Hard. Hard, hard, no. 
[Laughter off camera]

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:53.560
Desk. *Bleep*

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.960
Desk.

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:01.680
So why does swearing help you withstand pain?

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.080
This is Dr Emma Byrne, a scientists and author
of the book

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:06.850
"Swearing is Good for You".

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:10.610
In the trial where they swear, they can keep
their hands in ice water

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:15.120
much longer, on average about half as long
again as when they're not swearing.

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.230
And what's more, afterwards when they're asked
how painful the ice water felt,

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:24.840
they will say that, actually while swearing
it feels less intense, it feels less painful.

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.720
It felt like it was the same amount of pain
but more manageable.

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:34.400
I say we should all swear all the time, sorry
mum.

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.800
In some follow up experiments the authors
found

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:41.320
that the effect still holds for people who
don't tend to swear much in daily life.

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.040
So what's going on here?

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.360
We know that swearing is a highly emotive
part of language.

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.560
There might be something emotional going on.

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.190
But we can also measure emotions outside of
the brain.

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:54.080
We can spot them in our physiology.

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.160
Your hands getting sweaty or your heart rate
rises.

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:01.400
And sure enough, when people are doing the
swearing condition,

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.800
if you measure things like their galvanic
skin response

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.520
or how sweaty their palms are getting.

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:09.180
Of if you measure their heart rate, you'll
see that they are

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.960
reacting physiologically to an emotional stimulus.

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:16.840
Far more than they are in the neutral condition.

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.920
One idea for why swearing helps with pain
is that

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:24.680
saying these emotionally charged words triggers
our fight or flight response,

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:29.280
hence the increased heart rate, by putting
us into a state a bit like aggression.

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:32.880
To explore this idea further, the same group
designed an experiment

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:36.349
to put people into a more aggressive state
by making them play

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:39.560
the first person shooter video game Medal
of Honor.

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:46.760
Compared with participants that played a golfing
game, Tiger Woods PGA Tour 07,

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:50.550
the first person shooters ranked more highly
on measures of aggression,

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:55.560
had higher heart rates and were able to withstand
the ice bucket experiment for longer.

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.910
Which seems to support the idea that something
like aggression

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.760
could be involved in easing the pain response.

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:05.920
But things aren't completely clear cut. In
another more recent study,

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:11.280
swearing was found to increase people's strength
and stamina on physical tasks.

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:13.660
But in this test, the authors didn't find
any

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:17.729
of the physiological responses associated
with fight or flight,

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:19.400
such as increased heart rate.

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:21.040
*Bleep*

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:25.270
They hypothesized that perhaps swearing acts
as a distraction

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:27.620
or maybe makes people feel less inhibited

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:30.120
and that's why their physical performance
increased.

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:32.840
For now, exactly why swearing has these effects

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:35.909
on pain tolerance and strength remains unknown.

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:38.070
Essentially *bleep* knows.

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:40.509
Hey guys, thanks for watching.
