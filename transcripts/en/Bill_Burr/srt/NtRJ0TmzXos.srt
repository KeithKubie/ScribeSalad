1
00:00:01,190 --> 00:00:01,480
Yeah.

2
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:02,770
Hey,
what's going on?

3
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:05,980
It's Bill Burr and it's time for the
Monday morning podcast for Monday,

4
00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:09,970
April 24th, 2017. How's it going? Oh,

5
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:13,900
why are you doing, how's
your week? Obs? Sorry,

6
00:00:13,901 --> 00:00:16,420
the podcast is a little late.
I traveled today.

7
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:22,240
I flew back from Boise, Idaho. Not
Boise. Everybody. There's an s in there.

8
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:26,850
That's what I learned when I was up
there. Boise, Idaho. And uh, you know,

9
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:31,090
it was hilarious when we, when
we landed, we landed it, it um,

10
00:00:32,050 --> 00:00:36,100
you know that uh, the fucking shooter,
you know on the plane, the shooter,

11
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,120
I don't meet with the gun cause you can't
get guns in the planes unless you make

12
00:00:40,121 --> 00:00:41,620
one like a,
what's his face there?

13
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:46,540
John Malcovich and that Clint
Eastwood movie. What was it called?

14
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,910
Gun.
Is that what it's called?

15
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,610
He made like that little plastic gun

16
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,360
until I get some goddamn respect
and he fucking hung up the phone.

17
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:03,600
Um, now this, I'm not talking about a
gun. The fucking, the shooter, the guy,

18
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:07,440
the wedge breaker.
It's like the second they ring,

19
00:01:07,441 --> 00:01:09,980
that Little Bing Bong mean you
can take off your seat belts.

20
00:01:09,981 --> 00:01:13,410
Some guy from 12 rows back,
like runs up to the front of the plane.

21
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:17,670
So of course he stops right on my routes
and I can't get up and I'm looking at

22
00:01:17,671 --> 00:01:20,080
his dad jeans and he was
wearing flip flops. Alright,

23
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:22,110
so I got to give it up to the guy.
All right,

24
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:25,890
you don't have to show that kind
of quickness with like, you know,

25
00:01:25,891 --> 00:01:28,230
a third of a shoe on, was
it? It was impressive.

26
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:33,920
So this fucking guy who was in the
row behind me diagonally across starts

27
00:01:34,831 --> 00:01:38,340
fucking chirping in his ear. It was
like the fucking NHL playoffs. I'm like,

28
00:01:38,341 --> 00:01:41,750
are these guys going to drop the gloves?
I see him talking to the guys,

29
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:44,610
see the guy, you know the flip flop
guy looking over his shoulder, right?

30
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,640
It's basically a guy with really nice
shoes and Polka dot socks in first class,

31
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:54,920
which is where I sit. I, that's I, I don't
give a fuck. I don't give a fuck for,

32
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:57,330
I'm flying to Las Vegas.
I sit in the front of the fucking plane.

33
00:01:57,331 --> 00:01:58,860
That's just how I do it.
All right?

34
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:01,500
I spent 20 goddamn years in the back
of the planets. What do you call them?

35
00:02:01,501 --> 00:02:02,230
Not good,

36
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:05,570
but they just spilled a fucking tee all
over the point of they put anything on.

37
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:10,110
What are the odds that I was putting
my wallet on the fucking string to the

38
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:13,050
teabag and in this shit's just going
to go all over the place. It's just,

39
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:16,350
I swear to God I'm having a hell
of a like fucking four days here.

40
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:17,963
Okay.

41
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:22,070
We got damn thing. It'd be little cunty
thing that can go wrong. You know,

42
00:02:22,071 --> 00:02:26,930
first I break my computer screen Ed
and then the tea bag comes out. I mean,

43
00:02:26,931 --> 00:02:27,764
Jesus Christ,

44
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:32,890
that's going to take me at least 11
seconds to clean up or I just kind of wipe

45
00:02:33,561 --> 00:02:35,540
it up with my sock. Oh,
what a fucking animal.

46
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,930
I said stop it from going down the side
of the table. Don't judge me. So anyways,

47
00:02:38,931 --> 00:02:42,770
let's get back to the Polka dots.
Polka dotted socks. All right.

48
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:47,960
Fucking gentlemen worked his way up
to the front of the fucking plane.

49
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:49,670
Or maybe he was born into money.
I don't know.

50
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:53,630
I don't think this guy was because he
was fucking all over this fucking animal

51
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:58,850
with his flip flops. Who was coming
up from, you know, the fucking,

52
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,400
the section of the plane

53
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:06,260
where this guy deserved a bait.
All right, telling you right now,

54
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:07,970
that should be your guys' goal in life.

55
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:11,810
You got to get to the front of the fucking
plane and that, that's not a metaphor.

56
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:16,130
That is it. Literally you have to get
to the front of the fucking plane.

57
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:20,060
Unless you don't travel that often,
then just, you know, suck it up.

58
00:03:20,061 --> 00:03:21,650
Who gives a shit?
But if you travel at time,

59
00:03:21,651 --> 00:03:25,340
you have to get to the front of the
fucking plane. And I'm telling you,

60
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:29,540
the only difference between the front of
the plane and the back of the plane is

61
00:03:29,541 --> 00:03:33,860
they just, they treat you like a
human being. That's it. That said,

62
00:03:33,861 --> 00:03:36,380
it's not like it used to be where,
you know,

63
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:38,990
there was fucking broads
up there and you know,

64
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:43,490
they'd meet you in the Eastern Airlines
fucking lounge afterwards and they,

65
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:46,580
you know, you have like a fuck it,
whatever the fuck happened in the 70s,

66
00:03:46,581 --> 00:03:50,960
you know what I mean? Is that incredible
meeting of pubes that that decade was.

67
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:54,500
Um,
so anyways,

68
00:03:54,501 --> 00:03:59,240
this guy is fucking in the guys who
like, I, you know, I got my fucking,

69
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:04,910
the free fucking Bose
headsets, the wireless ones
that those postcards gave me.

70
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:08,540
And then I found out this spying
on you if you have the APP,

71
00:04:08,541 --> 00:04:12,430
I had to delete the fucking APP,
Jesus Christ.

72
00:04:12,431 --> 00:04:14,600
And then I found out those
guys at blue apron are,

73
00:04:14,601 --> 00:04:17,440
I like going down to farmer's markets.
They go, hey, you don't want to,

74
00:04:17,441 --> 00:04:21,040
you don't want to be with these guys.
Come over to us. You know what I mean?

75
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:23,890
But a bunch of pussies,
if that's what they're doing,

76
00:04:23,891 --> 00:04:26,450
allegedly that's what they were doing.
Why don't you fucking go do that and that

77
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:33,010
Goddamn Ralph's do it in a supermarket,
right. Stay in your own weight class.

78
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:39,020
You colored apron cons.
It's fucking hilarious.

79
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:42,260
As Farmers Barker guy was going
off on him, it's going blue apron.

80
00:04:42,261 --> 00:04:45,770
They eliminate the middleman. He's
like, Aww, hello. You are the middleman.

81
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:48,920
You're dumb cunt. We eliminate
it. We farmed this shit.

82
00:04:48,921 --> 00:04:52,970
We're going right to
the people. Um, anyways,

83
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:55,760
I probably just lost the sponsor there,
but I don't give a fuck right.

84
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:58,190
If that's what they're doing.
If you weren't doing it,

85
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:01,980
I apologize to everybody that
uh, you know, wears an apron.

86
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:06,660
The color of my balls right
now. Okay. I apologize. Anyways.

87
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:11,810
Um, taste bill. Can he get to the fucking
fight? All right. All right. Sorry.

88
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:12,710
I'm a little distracted.

89
00:05:12,711 --> 00:05:15,620
I don't like doing this podcast on days
that I traveled on my, I'm a little,

90
00:05:15,621 --> 00:05:19,010
I'm a little scatterbrained there
more so than usual. All right.

91
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:23,690
Before you make a joke, God damn,
I knew computer screen is gleaming.

92
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:28,460
I'll tell you. Underrated breaking. You
have fucking computer screen. You know,

93
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:30,920
you take it down.
You never go to the apple store.

94
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:35,690
Don't ever go to the apple store.
The apple store is like flying coach.

95
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:38,630
Okay. You're going to go in there and
they're going to treat you like a fucking

96
00:05:38,631 --> 00:05:43,430
animal, you know, and they, as they
put themselves on a, on a higher plane,

97
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:48,110
walking around genius, right on this
shirt. What does your shirt say?

98
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:49,970
Says Nothing.
Right?

99
00:05:49,971 --> 00:05:52,010
Like you have no fucking thought in your
head and you've got to go down there

100
00:05:52,011 --> 00:05:55,490
and go talk to those fucking wirey cuts.
Um,

101
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:59,810
anyways, no, you've got to just
some local fucking place, you know,

102
00:05:59,811 --> 00:06:02,120
they charge you a little bit
more, but you go in there, okay.

103
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:05,780
And you get treated like a fucking human
being. So I go in there and you know,

104
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:09,590
and they see the busted computer screen.
They know what the fuck happened,

105
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:13,880
you know, and I'm not going to
lie to him like, Ah, you know, uh,

106
00:06:13,881 --> 00:06:17,360
I got a little one at home and she
knocked it off the table, but you know,

107
00:06:17,361 --> 00:06:21,260
doing that shit, I didn't do that.
They go, what happened to him? I said,

108
00:06:21,261 --> 00:06:22,670
I stabbed it with my phone.

109
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:24,903
Yeah.

110
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:30,440
So they start laughing. They go, why'd
you do that? I said, because, uh, eight,

111
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:33,730
I'm an impatient person and I'm
not good at these things. And uh,

112
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:37,990
it seemed like the right thing to do in
the moment and I immediately regretted

113
00:06:37,991 --> 00:06:41,590
it. So now I'm here to give you my money
if you can fix this. And they were like,

114
00:06:41,591 --> 00:06:42,424
absolutely.

115
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:43,953
You know,

116
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:47,640
know what's funny is I
always have a piece of tape.

117
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:49,650
I have a piece of tape
over the fucking camera.

118
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:53,850
So I don't want people watching me
fucking jerking off to porn. I don't want,

119
00:06:53,851 --> 00:06:55,890
I didn't want to watch people
meet, muttering, walking around,

120
00:06:55,891 --> 00:06:58,880
talking to myself in the hotel room,
trying to come up with new joy.

121
00:06:58,881 --> 00:07:01,230
I just don't want people watching me self.
That's the first thing I noticed.

122
00:07:01,231 --> 00:07:01,730
I was like,
wow,

123
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:05,370
this screen is really clean and fucking
big brother can see what's going on.

124
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:08,760
You know, I don't mind if
they can hear what's going on.

125
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:10,470
I just don't want them to see it.

126
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:18,640
So anyways, there's this guy, he's got
polka dot socks on his fucking, you know,

127
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:22,870
smart pair wingtip shoes on and
he's just fun given this Guy Shit.

128
00:07:22,871 --> 00:07:24,820
So I take off my Bose headphones,
you know,

129
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:28,780
which they probably downloaded the entire
argument. Let's fucking spine cuts,

130
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:32,920
right? So I take them off and he's right
mid sent to Jay. Just walk right up here.

131
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:36,040
Yeah, hit me with your bag. What's
wrong with you? What's wrong with you?

132
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:39,040
And I can't hear what the other
guy's saying, but this other guy,

133
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:40,060
the guy in first class,

134
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,910
you'd think he'd say some fucking
guy with little soft hands, you know,

135
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:46,930
never worked a day in his life. He's
fucking all over this guy to the point,

136
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:49,990
the guy who, who, uh, you know,

137
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:53,080
the flip flop guy just turns his back
and doesn't want to say anything.

138
00:07:53,081 --> 00:07:57,070
And this guy just keeps going, go.
And he goes, what do you do next?

139
00:07:57,150 --> 00:07:59,770
You're going to push down
a kid, you know, hey,

140
00:07:59,771 --> 00:08:01,180
you might want to brush your teeth too.

141
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:05,300
He started giving the guys shift from
bad. His breath stunk. I was like,

142
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:06,920
I've five fucking love this guy.

143
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:11,240
Fucking loved the guy,
just fucking,

144
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:14,510
just the entire time it took them
to get the goddamn jetway over.

145
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:19,700
This guy is just in his fucking and his
fucking ear and the guy wouldn't drop

146
00:08:19,701 --> 00:08:23,900
the gloves, would not drop the
gloves during the playoffs.

147
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:28,400
Unbelievable. You know, like he's some
star player. Right. And he's gonna,

148
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:31,970
he's gonna. He thought she hurt
the team fee fucking sits down

149
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:38,130
the shooter. Man. You don't have wished
would happened. I wished he grabbed,

150
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:42,050
I grabbed him by his backpack cause
I don't give a shit. If you have,

151
00:08:42,051 --> 00:08:45,800
if you fucking have a black
belt in every martial art,

152
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:50,240
um, discipline. If you have on
a backpack, it's fucking over.

153
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:54,530
Cause all the person has to
do once somebody just grabs
your backpack and starts

154
00:08:54,531 --> 00:08:59,530
running the other way. There's nothing
in Jujitsu. There's nothing in a kito.

155
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,250
You just, you can't, you know,

156
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:07,080
that's why if you watch the UFC
and Joe Rogan will tell you this,

157
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:11,310
that they do not allow backpacks into
the octagon for that specific reason.

158
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:16,350
You know what I mean? The backpack,
it's like the gun as far as like, just,

159
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:20,820
just throws the black belt right out the
window. You know what I mean? You know,

160
00:09:20,821 --> 00:09:21,810
like all karate movies,

161
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:23,790
like nobody can have a gun
cause then it's just kinda like,

162
00:09:23,791 --> 00:09:25,410
well yeah I can just shoot yet.
You know,

163
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:30,780
it's the coward way up or the CINCI way
out. Do you remember that meeting? Oh,

164
00:09:30,781 --> 00:09:33,300
you could do it at Cinci.
That's what I was a little kid.

165
00:09:33,301 --> 00:09:37,870
That was a word that just disappeared,
meant easy. I guess it's a cinch

166
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:44,120
became Cinci I just figured that out
fucking 48 years later I finally get it.

167
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:49,820
Um,
anyways,

168
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,980
I just wish I reached up,

169
00:09:51,981 --> 00:09:56,240
grabbed his backpack and yanked it back
past into the polka dotted sock guy and

170
00:09:56,241 --> 00:09:59,120
everybody just passed him right back
to his fucking row would have been

171
00:09:59,121 --> 00:10:00,620
tremendous.
You know,

172
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:03,770
and I know a lot of your young was through
this podcast and I could lie to you

173
00:10:03,771 --> 00:10:07,910
and say that pre nine 11 that was the
America that I, that I lived in, you know.

174
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:12,493
Well No,
you know,

175
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:14,870
like you could sit in my house and not
have to worry about somebody from the

176
00:10:14,871 --> 00:10:16,820
Geek squad watching me
fucking rub one out.

177
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,370
You know when the privacy
male Goddamn home,

178
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:23,660
I have tape over every fucking thing
I could find. I they can listen,

179
00:10:23,661 --> 00:10:26,630
but the kids, see that's the
deal. If there's no video,
it's just like the podcast,

180
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:31,190
no fucking video and my living
room right now that got, I got,

181
00:10:31,191 --> 00:10:35,120
I got my TV, they got little fucking
camera up there. Not fucking doing that.

182
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:40,010
I want to look at some fucking pimple
faced, do and play a war of the worlds.

183
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:44,350
Whatever these kids do, you know, or the
world's waterways with fuck, Warcraft,

184
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:47,540
Minecraft, mind head. What is it called

185
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:55,930
as a video game transcended video gamers
to the point that I actually know isn't

186
00:10:55,931 --> 00:10:58,420
it wasn't witches of Eastwick.
What does that,

187
00:10:59,650 --> 00:11:03,550
what does that fucking game that
everybody loses that by when it comes out.

188
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:06,430
It's not war craft.
Something like that.

189
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:13,750
I, it'll come to me. No one or
whatever. That's how you just guess.

190
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:16,630
I'd get out of your own stupidity. That's
such a great phrase. Ad will come to me.

191
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:21,790
What an, I know that back in the day
when I was in math class, you know,

192
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:26,970
what is the sine, cosine and
tangent of that fucking iPod news?

193
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:32,620
Uh, Mr Burn. Oh, it's uh,
uh, don't tell him though.

194
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:37,030
I, you know, it'll come to me. It'll come
to me now my teacher today, fair enough.

195
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:40,000
Then maybe I would've have to go to
summer school two out of four years.

196
00:11:40,001 --> 00:11:42,010
I should have gone all three. Fuck,
I should've got all four years.

197
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:43,300
You know what I mean?

198
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:45,940
My Sophomore teacher let me off
the hook and gave me a d minus,

199
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:50,320
and then senior year I was
like, well, what's the point?
What's the fucking point?

200
00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:55,980
What am I getting to a better community?
Yeah.

201
00:11:55,981 --> 00:11:57,390
It didn't make any fucking difference.
You know what I mean?

202
00:11:57,510 --> 00:12:02,040
It's like when the fucking
outfields play in, in, you know,

203
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,940
and then the guy up to the plate,
he hits it over the guy's fucking head.

204
00:12:04,941 --> 00:12:06,570
He doesn't go get it and she just runs it.

205
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:11,580
That's why I treated some schools my
senior year, not fucking doing that shit.

206
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:14,850
What's the point when I can
go out and get hammered,

207
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:19,740
drive drunk and do what you did in
the 80s just driving around, hammered,

208
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:25,080
hammered. You'd go down to the
fucking liquor store. The packy is,

209
00:12:25,081 --> 00:12:29,370
we called it ain't go down a package,
get me a sex at dote,

210
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:32,550
we'd go down to the package store, right.
And you just stand there out front,

211
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:37,580
you know the hands in your pockets looking
as conspicuous as possible and then

212
00:12:38,071 --> 00:12:41,400
you just fucking walk up to adults and
be like, Hey, could you buy me some beer?

213
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:45,740
You know? And there was no fight. There
was no cameras back then. It television,

214
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:46,710
it just been invented.
I mean,

215
00:12:46,711 --> 00:12:50,160
and then nobody knew how to work
these things and people would do that.

216
00:12:50,161 --> 00:12:53,610
They would actually like not
even think about the liability.

217
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:57,540
They would go out and they, you know,
you try to judge like get a buyer.

218
00:12:57,570 --> 00:13:01,620
That's what it was. You tried to like
tried to like pick the right person.

219
00:13:01,621 --> 00:13:04,020
Somebody look cool. You know what I
mean? Anybody in a suit, you're like,

220
00:13:04,021 --> 00:13:08,280
fuck that guy. I'm not asking him.
You don't ask a mom, you know,

221
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:12,330
didn't ask any women, you know what I
mean? Unless she hoard it up a little bit.

222
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,920
You like,
you then you gotta make the judgment call.

223
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:18,990
How involved in her life
was her father? Uh, I dunno.

224
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:22,020
I Dunno now I'm not doing it though.
I'm not doing it.

225
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:25,050
Then you just wait for somebody a
little bit of long hair, you know,

226
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,770
some fucking shitty little mustache.

227
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:30,300
It looks for a dirtbags
basically what you did,

228
00:13:30,301 --> 00:13:34,650
someone who would have no concern for
people under age driving away with alcohol

229
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:37,830
and um,
and that's the way it was done.

230
00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:40,450
I don't even know what I'm talking
about right now. You know what?

231
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:42,840
As I got these fucking helicopters
in my ears, can you hear that?

232
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:44,970
Think they're like hovering
right over my house.

233
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:49,830
They have an a big parade right now
on a parade or a or something. It's a,

234
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:56,460
the Armenians, the recognizing
or remembering everybody who,

235
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:59,550
uh, died in the genocide, you know,

236
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:02,521
you know,

237
00:14:02,521 --> 00:14:05,820
I just realized that just really just
fucked up my relationship with the Turkish

238
00:14:05,821 --> 00:14:08,310
funny bone. I probably won't be
getting any weekends out there for well

239
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:16,930
that in Kazakh or stay in wherever the
two countries are that try to act like

240
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:21,010
that. We didn't, we never did that.
Ah, that never happened. Yeah.

241
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,900
Well the rest of the world knows it did.

242
00:14:22,901 --> 00:14:25,210
So you could just sit there
and deny it all you want,

243
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:27,490
but are you fucking Bernie Madoff?

244
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:31,840
How long are you going to
fucking lie about this shit? Um,

245
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:36,760
I actually watched this documentary,
speaking of just despicable,

246
00:14:36,761 --> 00:14:40,240
horrible things to do to human beings.
You know,

247
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:43,780
I don't know anything about Turkish
people, but I'll tell you right now,

248
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:48,850
if they will probably scared shitless
of Armenia. It's, you know what I mean?

249
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:52,100
The fucking tough people.
That's probably what it was.

250
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,340
They got all nervous to some shit.
I don't know what it was.

251
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:59,490
It's a lot of Armenians in my
neighborhood and I swear to God,

252
00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:02,240
like every other one of them
you look at you like, is that,

253
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:03,630
is that a UFC champion?

254
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:08,460
They fucking jacked the heads of shaped.

255
00:15:08,461 --> 00:15:13,210
Every one of them just looks like they
could kick the shit out of you. I Dunno,

256
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:15,940
maybe Turkey got nervous.
I have no idea what happened.

257
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:17,910
I don't know how you
could fucking do that.

258
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:20,533
MMM.

259
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:24,710
I don't know. The older I get, the
older I get, the more a second.

260
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:29,160
And human behavior becomes not saying
I'm some fucking sink, but I still,

261
00:15:29,161 --> 00:15:33,690
for the life of me do not understand
how war is legal. I just don't,

262
00:15:33,691 --> 00:15:34,590
I don't get it.

263
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:37,053
You know,

264
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:38,320
let, let's, let's,

265
00:15:38,321 --> 00:15:41,770
let's wait into international waters
here without really paying attention to

266
00:15:41,771 --> 00:15:46,420
anything. I don't, you know,
I don't even watch the BBC,

267
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,640
you know, that's what a lot of
stuck up cons over here. Do.

268
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:52,000
I just want to get another perspective?
Um,

269
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:55,350
so Syria gases,

270
00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:58,670
some of its own fucking people and
then we shoot missiles at them.

271
00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:03,100
So my thing is where do the
missiles go and who died?

272
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:04,640
Yeah.

273
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:06,350
How accurate are those missiles?

274
00:16:06,351 --> 00:16:08,960
Was it just some guy selling
popcorn on this quarter?

275
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:12,590
A buzz Syria in a Kazakh is Stan,
you know,

276
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:18,200
and he's upstairs. The
FREIDA X, right? There we go.

277
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:25,380
Then we're like, oh, sorry
about that. Sorry about that.

278
00:16:25,381 --> 00:16:28,710
We would try to get the guy that
did the thing that we didn't like.

279
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:30,910
We frowned upon.

280
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:37,350
We would like to apologize to anybody
at the food court. I have no idea.

281
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:41,650
Or our missiles that good. I
don't know. I have no idea.

282
00:16:41,651 --> 00:16:42,880
I just don't get how that works.

283
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:46,013
MMM.

284
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,900
Yeah. Warren's just really, I
just don't, I don't understand it.

285
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:52,830
We're going to murder
more your people before a,

286
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:56,330
you murder all people
and then when we win,

287
00:16:56,331 --> 00:17:00,270
we're going to say that you guys are evil,
right.

288
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:03,060
The only way it is if somebody just
starts with you, if they started,

289
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:04,753
you know,

290
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,700
then you've got to finish it.
I guess that's how it works.

291
00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:08,363
You know what I mean?

292
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:11,980
Did Sean Connery make a speech about this
and the untouchables or something like

293
00:17:11,981 --> 00:17:12,814
that?

294
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:15,130
I don't fucking know,

295
00:17:16,850 --> 00:17:17,330
but I don't,

296
00:17:17,330 --> 00:17:20,540
I don't get why we're all up in arms about
that hairless fat fuck over there and

297
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,460
Korea.
You know what I mean?

298
00:17:25,090 --> 00:17:25,571
I just don't,

299
00:17:25,571 --> 00:17:28,720
I don't understand why this guy can't
shoot off his fireworks at his own fucking

300
00:17:28,721 --> 00:17:31,690
country. I mean, we do that shit
all the time. Who gives a fuck?

301
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:34,640
What is that fucking

302
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:35,510
yeah.

303
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:37,050
Take [inaudible] got a dope.

304
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:41,250
Yeah,

305
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:44,610
that's what he's built.
Like he's built like a journal.

306
00:17:44,611 --> 00:17:48,960
He just has like a fucking,
yeah. I these adorable,

307
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:50,510
if you would just stop with the,

308
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:54,330
I'm going to blow up fog in the United
States that he, she got admit the guy.

309
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:56,760
He's kind of adorable,
you know,

310
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:02,330
I dunno, I have no
fucking idea. But anyway,

311
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:05,360
so I was watching this thing on Europe,
uh,

312
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:09,110
right after World War II and uh,
then I,

313
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:13,510
it was so fascinating to me. What the
fuck was going on that I actually,

314
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:16,700
I went on,
I actually got on the Internet,

315
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:18,950
I didn't have my laptop because
I stabbed it with my phone,

316
00:18:18,951 --> 00:18:23,540
but my phone was still working,
so I was checking out, you know,

317
00:18:23,541 --> 00:18:27,560
a couple of websites and this one
website put exactly how my mindset was,

318
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:31,580
how I believed World War II right
after was like, right. I mean,

319
00:18:31,581 --> 00:18:35,450
I knew in Germany that obviously they
had the fucking rebuild, you know,

320
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:41,470
obviously Japan. Hello. That was a rough
one, right. I knew that they, you know,

321
00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:44,110
we're rebuilding, but everybody
else, I kinda thought, hey, you know,

322
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:47,620
everybody was all in a good mood and
shit and skipping down the fucking street

323
00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:48,603
because it was over.

324
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:52,090
Is this website put at the end of it
was sailors kissing nurses and fucking

325
00:18:52,091 --> 00:18:56,580
times square. That was it.
And evidently it was not,

326
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:58,803
uh,

327
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:00,241
in a lot of ways,

328
00:19:00,241 --> 00:19:04,910
like people were acting exactly the way
against the people they were fighting.

329
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:08,280
It was fucking brutal. If there
was all kinds of rapes, murders,

330
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10,050
people settling scores,

331
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:12,753
mmm.

332
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:16,870
All Germans that were all around Europe
that, you know, we're not in Germany.

333
00:19:16,871 --> 00:19:20,500
They were getting fucking
killed and sent back to Germany,

334
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:25,050
couple of little mini
genocides, which, you know,

335
00:19:25,051 --> 00:19:28,470
between people in eastern fucking
Europe, it was just like, Jesus Christ.

336
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:32,940
And I have to take some of
these, the fucking Nazis
too. Every time I think like,

337
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:34,920
I've heard the worst thing they ever did.

338
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,110
It's like you literally
can't even watch it.

339
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:40,540
I just found out something else they did.
I'm going to tell you,

340
00:19:40,541 --> 00:19:44,140
it was so fucking disturbing.
I'm not even going to repeat it.

341
00:19:45,670 --> 00:19:47,500
I can't stop fucking thinking about it.

342
00:19:47,501 --> 00:19:50,890
And then they were showing the Goddamn
Nuremberg trials and those fucking Nazi

343
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:53,200
consists sitting there with this
arrogant look on their face like,

344
00:19:53,201 --> 00:19:54,520
well this is fucking bullshit,

345
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:56,773
you know,

346
00:19:57,590 --> 00:19:59,240
and then I'm thinking,
how could you think that?

347
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:01,850
How could you not be like
wow yeah that got a little,

348
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:05,930
yeah we guess we got a little
sideways with that plan. Have

349
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:09,081
the fucking sitting there.

350
00:20:09,081 --> 00:20:11,650
You know what these look on
their face like [inaudible] like,

351
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,100
like this is fucking bullshit.

352
00:20:15,101 --> 00:20:18,250
And I'm thinking like how could they
possibly think that cause their PR and I'm

353
00:20:18,251 --> 00:20:22,390
thinking they think, well if we fucking
won you guys would be sitting here.

354
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:27,220
All right, what about when you fire
bombed Dresden about that shit?

355
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:28,240
And then we can just be like,

356
00:20:28,241 --> 00:20:31,060
well you know we wouldn't have done that
if you wouldn't do what you are doing

357
00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:35,800
if you weren't doing what you were
doing. All right, Mister Blonde.

358
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:39,550
They just done what I told him that
though no one would've been dead.

359
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:42,910
That's what we were doing. If you
didn't do what the fuck you are doing,

360
00:20:42,911 --> 00:20:46,990
we wouldn't have done what we did. And
then they would say, well, we what we,

361
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:49,660
we learned from you with what
you did to the native Americans.

362
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:52,420
And then we would say, well,
you know what? That wasn't us.

363
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,000
We weren't alive when that happened. And
then they'd be like, well, you know what?

364
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:58,060
You're still alive and a lot of m is
still alive and you're not doing anything

365
00:20:58,061 --> 00:21:01,660
about it. And whether we like, all
right, fair enough. You know what?

366
00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:05,650
We'll set some emotion to
eventually give a mark casinos.

367
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:10,780
The Nazis would be like, ah, you
know, fair enough, fair enough.

368
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:15,250
And that's it usually stay in all his
fucking footage of them hanging these

369
00:21:15,251 --> 00:21:20,150
fucking guys. Just a nonchalant way.
They did it there. This is 42 this guy,

370
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:24,050
I don't know what the fuck it was.
It was like, it was just a board.

371
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:28,790
It was like a do it yourself,
fucking hang the guy right in court.

372
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:34,530
The fucking tie. The guy's hands behind
his back. They lay him down on this board.

373
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:36,930
It just goes like to a 45 degree angle.

374
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:39,870
They hoisted guy up,

375
00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:43,410
they put a fucking rope around
his neck and he's sitting there

376
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:46,800
fucking all in them up.
Right.

377
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:51,450
And then a guy with gloves just covers
the guy's eyes and then they let go of

378
00:21:51,451 --> 00:21:54,600
them. And as the guys slides
down, he breaks his neck.

379
00:21:54,601 --> 00:21:55,890
And the guy with the hands just,

380
00:21:55,891 --> 00:21:58,800
he just moves his hand with the guys
had seen ever see his fucking eyes,

381
00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:01,800
you know, cause they didn't
want to upset people in court.

382
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:10,160
It's fucking insane.
Fucking insane. And uh,

383
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:11,910
yeah,

384
00:22:11,910 --> 00:22:13,890
Jesus Christ.
I gotta be honest with you.

385
00:22:13,891 --> 00:22:17,430
I really wish I didn't watch it because
there was this woman testifying and that,

386
00:22:17,431 --> 00:22:20,790
that, that, you know, if
you want to see it, I can't
remember. Remember the program.

387
00:22:20,791 --> 00:22:24,480
I'm sure you can find it on the fucking
Internet. You know, just Google.

388
00:22:24,481 --> 00:22:26,520
What the fuck was bill talking about?
World War II.

389
00:22:26,521 --> 00:22:30,300
I'm sure somebody will find it and um,

390
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:35,610
you got to see them like, you know, um,
all right. This is just not funny anymore.

391
00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:38,520
All right, let's plow ahead.
Let's talk about something
else. Okay. So I was in, uh,

392
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:43,110
I was in Boise. This, um, uh,

393
00:22:43,170 --> 00:22:46,850
Jesus Christ, sorry, I'm
typing in my password here.

394
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:52,160
I was at boy, you know what,
uh, does anybody seen uh,

395
00:22:54,010 --> 00:22:54,843

396
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:59,860
Joe McIntyre from new kids on the
block from the movie the heat.

397
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:03,190
I got to work with Tom with them on that,
that movie.

398
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:05,830
And he was fucking great guy.
Absolutely hilarious, right?

399
00:23:05,831 --> 00:23:09,640
So I was supposed to do a podcast
with them to help promote his shell.

400
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:11,320
And I had,

401
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:15,460
I just completely forgot and he drove
all the way over to this podcast studio

402
00:23:15,461 --> 00:23:19,750
and I wasn't there, completely fucked
the guy over. So he's going to be,

403
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:24,150
I'm going to be interviewing them for
next week's Monday morning podcast and he

404
00:23:24,151 --> 00:23:28,390
is going to give me a fucking ton of
shit. So out of guilt, I'm like, fuck,

pause cause I wanted to make sure that I,

408

network, but it's fucking hilarious.

424
00:24:34,231 --> 00:24:36,710
Just look it up. It's really,
really well written. And uh,

425
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:41,670
the guy who plays his agent is
a fucking beast. Um, kills it.

426
00:24:41,671 --> 00:24:46,020
And uh, I don't, I actually
found it interesting too,
like what his life is like,

427
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:47,633
you know,

428
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:52,880
cause it's based obviously on his life
and does so much like creepy older women

429
00:24:54,061 --> 00:24:55,250
wanting to come up and hug them.

430
00:24:58,940 --> 00:24:59,150
Okay.

431
00:24:59,150 --> 00:25:03,830
And now he's got to kind of
just allow them to do it. Um,

432
00:25:04,430 --> 00:25:08,780
I found that hilarious just because I
don't like people touching me. You know,

433
00:25:08,810 --> 00:25:12,050
I just,
after a while I just like,

434
00:25:12,051 --> 00:25:15,530
I so understand how even Dell,
you know what I mean?

435
00:25:16,430 --> 00:25:20,090
Just as people always wanted to come up
and touch him and then like what if he

436
00:25:20,091 --> 00:25:22,580
wants a fucking sandwich
and all those hands,

437
00:25:22,581 --> 00:25:25,310
he just shook all that DNA.

438
00:25:25,311 --> 00:25:28,520
He could literally start his own country
with what is on his fucking hands.

439
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:33,190
And when you really start thinking about
that, you know, that's, I don't know.

440
00:25:34,490 --> 00:25:38,150
Like my favorite time to meet people is
during the winter when I'm back east and

441
00:25:38,151 --> 00:25:41,690
you already have gloves on. I love
winter. When you're in New York,

442
00:25:41,990 --> 00:25:44,210
you know you can go on the subway,

443
00:25:44,211 --> 00:25:48,110
you can grab on to shit and you
can finally hold on, you know?

444
00:25:51,070 --> 00:25:51,550
Yeah.

445
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:54,400
Just walking down the street,
high five and homeless people.

446
00:25:55,390 --> 00:25:58,960
You don't give a shit. Right.
You got on gloves. It's perfect.

447
00:26:00,490 --> 00:26:02,440
Maybe that's what I'm going to do.
You know?

448
00:26:02,441 --> 00:26:05,500
I've always been looking for something.
Oh look who's here.

449
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:08,050
Am I being too loud?

450
00:26:09,010 --> 00:26:09,780
Yeah.

451
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:14,430
No, no, no. I haven't done the podcast
yet. Oh, it's the two lovely ladies.

452
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:20,270
Can I say a load of my daughter?
What's up?

453
00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:24,110
Huh? Oh, you know what?

454
00:26:24,111 --> 00:26:27,350
The Internet doesn't work in the office
and I was worried I was going to stab my

455
00:26:27,351 --> 00:26:31,910
laptop again with my phone. I
didn't want to do that. Give me a,

456
00:26:31,911 --> 00:26:36,560
let me get one little smile here. Let
me get one little smile. Hey Buddy. Oh,

457
00:26:36,561 --> 00:26:41,560
she just woke up. Did you just
wake up? Hey, remember me? Yeah,

458
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:46,500
it is that smile. Oh, are you
all right? She's too adorable.

459
00:26:46,501 --> 00:26:50,940
And this is not going to be a funny
podcast anymore. How are you? Acuity?

460
00:26:51,870 --> 00:26:55,980
We're going to hang out today. Ah,
we do a couple bs. Nice smile, right?

461
00:26:58,900 --> 00:26:59,660
Yeah.

462
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:00,493
Oh,

463
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:09,630
sorry. I'm back. I'm back. Um, all
right, let me do some of the, um,

464
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:14,610
let me do some of the regions. So yeah,
check out our return of the Mack. Yeah.

465
00:27:14,611 --> 00:27:19,440
How funny is that show? There you
go. See that Nia would never lie.

466
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:23,700
Um, all right, let me, let me read
some of these fucking things here.

Where is? All right. Okay,
here we go. Oh, policy genius.

468

Life Insurance. Do you have
it? If you don't, why not?

469
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:37,380
Too expensive or a hassle,
man,

470
00:27:37,410 --> 00:27:40,290
I actually have life insurance now
and I'm fucking excited. You know,

471
00:27:40,890 --> 00:27:45,600
I can't tell you how relaxed I am on
planes now. Now I know that if I die,

472
00:27:45,601 --> 00:27:46,470
it doesn't matter.

473
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:50,470
Yeah.

474
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:54,940
I have rendered myself like just,
I don't know,

475
00:27:54,941 --> 00:27:57,960
I've just sort of delegated everything
out to this point that I'm just sort of

476
00:27:57,970 --> 00:27:59,850
useless.

I don't know.

535
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:03,370
Hey, fill it feels good. I don't know.

536
00:32:04,530 --> 00:32:07,450
These guys give me anxiety like I
thought my aunt, my mattress was fine.

537
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:11,080
This is a classic sales technique.
Scare the shit out of them.

538
00:32:11,081 --> 00:32:16,081
Create a need because it truly customized
mattress will cost you five to 10,000

00:32:16,361 --> 00:32:19,180
bucks.
Who the fuck has that kind of money?

540
00:32:20,250 --> 00:32:23,320
But that guy with the polka.sucks stuff.
You know I loved about him.

541
00:32:23,321 --> 00:32:26,680
He wasn't afraid of getting sued either.
Is that on my screen? Oh No. Okay.

Helux Helix.

553
00:33:06,210 --> 00:33:10,810
A customers report at 30%
improvement in overall sleep quality.

554
00:33:11,670 --> 00:33:15,970
I don't, I don't understand how you know,
I guess how you feel when you wake up.

555
00:33:16,810 --> 00:33:21,310
How does it feel? It feels, yeah.
How much better I, you know,

556
00:33:21,311 --> 00:33:25,990
I don't know.
30% 30% sounds like a lie.

557
00:33:26,110 --> 00:33:29,350
If they said like 27%
it'd be like, okay, no,

558
00:33:29,351 --> 00:33:32,500
but that's something people would say.
They'd pick a round number. All right.

559
00:33:32,501 --> 00:33:34,660
You know what? I believe him.
All right. And for couples,

560
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:37,990
they customize each side of the mattress.
That's the beginning of the divorce.

561
00:33:37,991 --> 00:33:38,560
By the way,

562
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:43,300
your mattress arrives at your door in
about a week and shipping is 100% free and

563
00:33:43,301 --> 00:33:46,900
you and your wife can
begin to slow drift apart.

564
00:33:46,930 --> 00:33:51,210
Like the way the continent's separated,
right? Just, it all starts with my man.

565
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:54,310
I want the mattress to feel like this.
I want it to feel that way.

566
00:33:55,330 --> 00:33:58,420
And you know how it works in relationship.
You know somebody has to cave,

567
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:01,120
but not anymore.
Thanks to Helen's sleep,

568
00:34:01,630 --> 00:34:04,690
breaking up marriages for over 30 years.
Um,

569
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:07,810
your mattress arrives in about a
week and it's shipping is 100% free.

570
00:34:07,811 --> 00:34:12,460
That's why everyone from Gq magazine,
oh Jesus, Gq magazine. Oh my God.

571
00:34:12,490 --> 00:34:15,040
Get out the Moose to Forbes. Oh,

572
00:34:15,041 --> 00:34:17,560
the banker cuts are all
talking about helic sleep.

573
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:22,450
You have a hundred nights to try it
out. Graphs. And if you don't love it,

574
00:34:22,451 --> 00:34:26,800
they'll pick it up for free
and give you 100% refund,

575
00:34:26,801 --> 00:34:29,590
no questions as whenever I
pictured them picking it up.

576
00:34:29,591 --> 00:34:33,460
I always picture fucking Jesse and Mr.
White showing up in their hazmat suits.

577
00:34:34,070 --> 00:34:37,360
Uh, go to helix. Speaking
of Boise. All right.

578
00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:40,120
Aaron Paul,
he's from up there.

579
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:44,710
Go to [inaudible] dot com slash
burr and get $50 off your order.

580
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:49,660
That's helix, sleep.com/burr
Helen's sleep.com/per.

581
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:54,610
Okay. Anyways, so let's get
onto, okay, so I was up there.

582
00:34:54,611 --> 00:34:59,310
I am going to talk hockey, but I'm,
I'm trying to avoid the pain. Um,

583
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:03,150
I'm trying to avoid the pain.
Okay.

584
00:35:03,210 --> 00:35:07,150
I just thought about Carlito's way
it comes to debt. I read that Ad.

585
00:35:10,390 --> 00:35:14,410
Kleinfeld is my friend. Um, that's,

586
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:16,600
that's one of my favorite
roles Sean Penn ever played.

587
00:35:17,650 --> 00:35:19,210
I fucking love him in that.

588
00:35:19,211 --> 00:35:22,990
I love them with the fucking Perm
and the receding hairline, you know,

589
00:35:22,991 --> 00:35:26,050
he's doing the fucking blow.
Cop comes in,

590
00:35:26,930 --> 00:35:29,560
says all that crazy shit to him,
trying to scare the shit out of him.

591
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:34,340
He just looks at the cop
and goes, Dun, Dun, Duh.

592
00:35:37,770 --> 00:35:42,150
Fucking hilarious. I don't want
to love Sean Penn. You know,

593
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:45,660
sometimes I pray for a flood just so I
can see him coming up in a boat just to

594
00:35:45,661 --> 00:35:50,400
rescue me. He's that Kinda
guy. Um, anyways, um,

595
00:35:50,401 --> 00:35:55,200
so I'm up in Boise, Idaho working the
Egyptian theater at a great fucking time,

596
00:35:55,230 --> 00:36:00,180
despite the fact for the first
time in like 12, 13 years,

597
00:36:00,181 --> 00:36:03,660
I had to kick somebody out of the show
and I never do that. And I told the guy,

598
00:36:03,690 --> 00:36:07,440
I don't want to do that.
I think it's a pussy move by a comedian,

599
00:36:07,590 --> 00:36:12,420
deal with the heckler. And that's it. But
this guy was just, he just was, you know,

600
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:17,100
he wasn't even remotely coherent. And, uh,

601
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:20,130
I dunno, I offered to pay for his tickets
and all that. I was just like, dude,

602
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:21,810
you just, you've got to go,
you've got gotta fucking go.

603
00:36:21,811 --> 00:36:24,300
And I gave him like a one more word.
You could just shut the fuck up.

604
00:36:24,301 --> 00:36:27,270
And he's still
[inaudible] I couldn't,

605
00:36:27,450 --> 00:36:29,580
I couldn't even respond to what he's
saying cause I couldn't understand them.

606
00:36:30,210 --> 00:36:34,290
And it was getting, uh, it
was getting ugly. It was
getting ugly. So, uh, you know,

607
00:36:35,010 --> 00:36:39,480
I apologized to the people there
and if the guys listening, you know,

608
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:43,470
just come back next time
sober. All right. That's all.

609
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:45,060
I didn't want to do it all right.

610
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:48,510
I'm sure you woke up today all
fucking mad at me. Um, you know,

611
00:36:48,511 --> 00:36:52,890
when they threw him out, they found 14
beers, empty beer cans underneath is a

612
00:36:54,450 --> 00:36:57,900
underneath the seat. I Dunno know
if they're trumping up the charges.

613
00:36:57,901 --> 00:36:59,160
I don't know if,
cause he was in the front row,

614
00:36:59,161 --> 00:37:02,280
a bunch of Rosa beers cans
rolled down to him. I have no,

615
00:37:02,281 --> 00:37:05,550
I don't pretend to fucking
know. But anyways, I was, um,

616
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:09,810
I was performing at that theater and uh,

617
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:13,080
one of the coolest things
anybody has ever done for me,

618
00:37:13,390 --> 00:37:16,680
the people at the theater
heard that I played drums.

619
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:21,420
So they rented a drum kit and during
the day I got to go into the theater,

620
00:37:22,050 --> 00:37:25,470
the theater and just fucking,
you know,

621
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:29,400
put it on my Walkman, whatever the fuck
you call it, the iPod thing, my phone,

622
00:37:30,210 --> 00:37:34,140
my little handheld stereo and just
fucking, just rock out man. I had a,

623
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:37,500
I had a great time. And whoever
the, whoever tuned up those drums,

624
00:37:37,501 --> 00:37:40,140
they sounded great.
The snare was fucking unbelievable.

625
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:46,750
He's that guy. It was like a marching,
I don't know what the f how deep it was.

626
00:37:46,751 --> 00:37:50,920
It was like six and a half by
like, uh, what's the next size up?

627
00:37:52,350 --> 00:37:56,270
I'm sorry, it was like 14 by six
and a half. What's the next size up?

628
00:37:56,271 --> 00:37:58,130
Is it eight inches deep?
Nine inches deep.

629
00:37:58,131 --> 00:38:00,380
But this isn't a point here
people I'm fucking asking.

630
00:38:01,710 --> 00:38:02,070
Yeah.

631
00:38:02,070 --> 00:38:04,380
Was incredible.
Incredible fucking sound.

632
00:38:04,890 --> 00:38:08,520
And that was his old Ludwig's and
they didn't even have like the usual,

633
00:38:08,970 --> 00:38:11,000
I'm like lugs on them.

634
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:13,760
Whatever the fuck he called the things
you unscrew and you're tuning up and tune

635
00:38:13,761 --> 00:38:16,530
it down. The drama, whatever
tensioning tensioning the drum,

636
00:38:16,730 --> 00:38:17,830
whatever the fuck he supposed to say it.

637
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,820
They just had screws that were all
stripped so it's got this great kid.

638
00:38:21,821 --> 00:38:26,040
But to adjust it, I had to take out a pair
of pliers that came with the drug kit.

639
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:30,240
Um, so it was a five piece,
broke it down to the four piece,

640
00:38:30,241 --> 00:38:34,620
set up the Steven Adler fucking setup
that I fell in love with when appetite for

641
00:38:34,621 --> 00:38:36,190
destruction came out.
You know,

642
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:39,880
when I was going down the slippery
slope of I won as many drugs as possible

643
00:38:40,030 --> 00:38:42,880
cause I was listening to iron maiden.
And then Steven Adler came out. I'm like,

644
00:38:42,881 --> 00:38:46,390
this fucking guy's getting more music
out of these four drums and half these

645
00:38:46,391 --> 00:38:48,400
guys out with these fucking 15 piece kits.

646
00:38:49,210 --> 00:38:51,420
So,
um,

647
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:55,640
I just say I had,
I had the greatest fucking time and uh,

648
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:59,680
was up there with the Rosebowl
tailgate legend Joe Barnett,

649
00:38:59,710 --> 00:39:04,710
who fucking murdered all week
and a Monday morning podcast,

650
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:07,840
uh,
produce producer,

651
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:12,890
producer said he said extraordinary
Andrew Stimulus was up there.

652
00:39:13,430 --> 00:39:17,060
And uh, we made a tour. We did a tour
of, uh, Boise. When we fuck that,

653
00:39:17,061 --> 00:39:21,740
we got everywhere. We got fucking
everywhere. We went on the blue field,

654
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:26,330
we went up to the fucking table rock.
We will all over that fucking town.

655
00:39:26,331 --> 00:39:29,780
We had a great time. Um,
so that'll be coming out.

656
00:39:29,781 --> 00:39:31,460
The San Jose one is almost done.

657
00:39:31,461 --> 00:39:35,840
And then I also got another one for
a San Antonio that's coming up. So a,

658
00:39:35,841 --> 00:39:37,370
I'm just going to start
doing those fucking things.

659
00:39:37,371 --> 00:39:39,680
I don't know why I like doing
them. They're fun, you know,

660
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:41,480
plus it makes me get up and do shit.
You know,

661
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:45,050
I've been to Boise a number of times.
I never got up into those fucking hills,

662
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:48,710
you know, so all right. I think
I've avoided it long enough.

663
00:39:48,711 --> 00:39:50,840
Let's talk about the NHL playoffs.

664
00:39:52,250 --> 00:39:53,083
Woo.

665
00:39:56,380 --> 00:39:57,213
Uh,

666
00:39:57,630 --> 00:39:58,463
you know,

667
00:39:59,070 --> 00:40:02,310
you want your team to make the playoffs
until they lose a playoff series,

668
00:40:02,311 --> 00:40:06,150
then you dislike. Oh, that
sucked. Shouldn't they just
not have made the playoffs?

669
00:40:06,151 --> 00:40:09,090
They could just rip the
emotional bandaid right off. Um,

670
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:11,580
congratulations of saying
this through gritted teeth.

671
00:40:11,581 --> 00:40:16,230
Congratulations to the Ottawa senators.
Looks so well flight series.

672
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:20,220
I had nothing to show out racetrack
for you guys in your organization.

673
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:23,780
Good luck in the next round
against the New York fog. Good Ray.

674
00:40:26,170 --> 00:40:27,003
MMM.

675
00:40:27,750 --> 00:40:32,610
And uh, and I gotta you know, you know,
they always do the star of the game.

676
00:40:32,611 --> 00:40:35,460
I mean, at some point you
got to give it to those, uh,

677
00:40:36,330 --> 00:40:39,990
all those Ottawa locals, you know,
there were refereeing those games,

678
00:40:42,930 --> 00:40:47,160
particularly game three, game five,
and even a little bit of game six.

679
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:51,600
You know, I'm not saying if, you know,
I'm not saying that's why we lost,

680
00:40:51,601 --> 00:40:55,080
but Jesus fucking Christ,
all I wanted was a little consistency.

681
00:40:56,010 --> 00:40:58,950
You know it is a deal.
A ref can fuck in one game,

682
00:40:58,951 --> 00:41:03,230
but you know when it's like
three out of the sex Jesus cry.

683
00:41:03,250 --> 00:41:06,180
How many times did we have to win game
five before they feared at school?

684
00:41:06,181 --> 00:41:07,590
Like two fucking goals.

685
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:13,770
If fucking sit in the crease covering the
puck up in the crease, not the goalie.

686
00:41:14,010 --> 00:41:15,880
Okay. For those who don't
watch hockey, that's,

687
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:19,380
I've been watching hockey for 37
fucking years. That's a penalty shot.

688
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:20,853
Cool.

689
00:41:21,330 --> 00:41:23,950
They have replay.
I don't know how they met our uh,

690
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:28,710
after further review where the defense
man put his hand over the Puck,

691
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:30,090
we could no longer see the,

692
00:41:30,470 --> 00:41:33,650
so it was inconclusive as to whether
it was underneath his or not.

693
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:35,990
So we actually won game five,

694
00:41:35,991 --> 00:41:40,070
despite the fucking Ref's
trying everything they
possibly could to give Ottawa

695
00:41:40,071 --> 00:41:43,550
chance to fucking win it.
Game three, was it the bottle?

696
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:46,013
You know,

697
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:50,720
end of the third period.
I can't remember the fuck it was.

698
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:54,080
Someone on auto just stood up and punched
one of the Bruins in the face and we

699
00:41:54,081 --> 00:41:55,370
got offsetting ruffings.

700
00:41:55,730 --> 00:41:59,600
We both got two minutes for roughing
the auto guy for punching the do in the

701
00:41:59,601 --> 00:42:02,870
face and I guess the Bruin for
not ducking. I don't know what he,

702
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:04,820
I don't know what,
we've got two minutes for not ducking

703
00:42:06,530 --> 00:42:09,290
for allowing yourself to be punched
in the face. I have no, so it was us.

704
00:42:09,291 --> 00:42:12,170
I was like, all right, that's
what he's gonna do. When I
saw that, I was like, okay,

705
00:42:12,171 --> 00:42:13,940
this ref is like,
it's going to be even strength.

706
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:16,280
I'm not going to be a part
of this horse shit. Okay.

707
00:42:16,490 --> 00:42:17,870
I don't know why he
punched him in the face.

708
00:42:17,871 --> 00:42:20,570
Maybe some other shit happened right
before that. And this is retaliation.

709
00:42:20,690 --> 00:42:22,670
I don't have time for you
fucking bullshit children.

710
00:42:22,950 --> 00:42:25,850
You both sit down and it's going to be
even strength and no one's going to know

711
00:42:25,851 --> 00:42:28,250
my fucking name at the end of this,
but that's not how it went down.

712
00:42:28,910 --> 00:42:30,050
Cause then in the fucking overtime,

713
00:42:31,010 --> 00:42:33,380
a lot of what comes in fucking
smash is us in the face.

714
00:42:33,381 --> 00:42:36,260
Nash punches the guy back in
the face and we get two minutes.

715
00:42:36,261 --> 00:42:40,500
They go on the power play in
the fucking Beatles. I Dunno.

716
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:43,530
I'm not even saying that we would have
won the fucking thing, but it's just like,

717
00:42:43,630 --> 00:42:45,060
well, what? Why do that to me now?

718
00:42:45,150 --> 00:42:46,770
I've got to think of that
the whole fucking summer.

719
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:52,050
Can't you just let auto a beat us? They
were going to beat us. Maybe they weren't.

720
00:42:52,051 --> 00:42:56,740
I don't know. I don't fucking know. But
Jesus Christ, I even thought that last,

721
00:42:56,750 --> 00:42:57,583
that last one. I mean, I'm, I'm,

722
00:42:57,650 --> 00:43:02,250
maybe I'm looking at this through fucking
black and gold fucking colored glasses,

723
00:43:02,251 --> 00:43:06,030
which of course I am. I'd love to hear
what you think of even like that fucking,

724
00:43:07,170 --> 00:43:11,940
you know, they want on the
power play again on some
ticky tack fucking horseshit.

725
00:43:13,310 --> 00:43:17,910
It looked bad, but when you looked
at the fucking, when I did anyways,

726
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:20,860
let's be honest, when I looked
at at the, at the instant replay,

727
00:43:21,310 --> 00:43:24,640
it's like pasta duck was trying to get
to the guy with the puck who's entering

728
00:43:24,730 --> 00:43:29,170
the offensive zone, Aka a fucking
scoring threat. The fucking auto.

729
00:43:29,171 --> 00:43:33,760
A guy turns around, looks at Pasta,
knock and initiates the contact

730
00:43:35,820 --> 00:43:38,730
pasta, reached out, grabs the
guy and he just sits on his ass.

731
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:43,650
Two minutes for fucking holding fucking
30 seconds later. Hey, enjoy your golfing.

732
00:43:43,950 --> 00:43:44,790
But you know what,

733
00:43:46,090 --> 00:43:46,430
okay,

734
00:43:46,430 --> 00:43:49,310
what do I do? I mean I
actually, I have no fucking,

735
00:43:49,490 --> 00:43:54,120
I don't give a shit about Ottawa at all.
I go there,

736
00:43:54,121 --> 00:43:57,330
I have a good time. I do shows
they've never done anything to us.

737
00:43:57,331 --> 00:43:59,730
For some reason they decided
to trade shower to us.

738
00:43:59,731 --> 00:44:04,140
So thank you for that to God bless you
on your fucking wing. But now I get this,

739
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:06,480
but you know,
something is sad is that was

740
00:44:07,610 --> 00:44:08,443
mmm,

741
00:44:08,710 --> 00:44:11,560
I was equally happy for the New
York Rangers. Not Cause I like,

742
00:44:11,580 --> 00:44:14,920
I don't dislike the rangers. He,
I actually liked the rangers. Um,

743
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:19,120
it's one of the few New York teams that
actually kind of a, see I really love,

744
00:44:19,121 --> 00:44:20,860
I actually love the Knicks
and I love the rangers.

745
00:44:21,130 --> 00:44:24,830
Unless they play in us then I don't like,
and it's not really even them.

746
00:44:24,850 --> 00:44:26,230
It's so we always comes down to the fence.

747
00:44:26,231 --> 00:44:29,740
So I was extremely excited that
the a range is knocked out.

748
00:44:29,741 --> 00:44:32,100
The Montreal Canadian Canadians,
of course,

749
00:44:32,101 --> 00:44:37,101
I cannot give a hundred percent
credit to the New York Rangers.

750
00:44:37,750 --> 00:44:37,790
Uh,

751
00:44:37,790 --> 00:44:42,790
I do have to thank the fans of Montreal
who were in the Montreal forum.

752
00:44:44,001 --> 00:44:45,770
The second forum on that fateful night,

753
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:51,160
when you guys absolutely
humiliated Patrick Wa to the
point he gave you guys the

754
00:44:51,921 --> 00:44:53,990
fingers, right, number,

755
00:44:53,991 --> 00:44:57,760
that then he went over and he sat on the
bench and he looked at your owner and

756
00:44:57,770 --> 00:45:01,460
I've read his lips. He said, listen, you
motherfucker, I'm never played for you.

757
00:45:01,790 --> 00:45:02,930
Cons again.
All right.

758
00:45:04,090 --> 00:45:04,490
Yeah,

759
00:45:04,490 --> 00:45:08,150
trade me to whoever the fucking Nordiques
are now. And that's what happened.

760
00:45:08,180 --> 00:45:12,110
That's exactly what happened.
He called it and then he went on any one,

761
00:45:12,111 --> 00:45:16,670
two more cups, I believe in [inaudible]
96 and in 2001 or was it 2000?

762
00:45:16,730 --> 00:45:19,440
I can't fucking remember.
Alright.

763
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:25,120
And the greatest thing ever is Mont the
Montreal Canadiens never won another

764
00:45:25,731 --> 00:45:29,600
cup. The end. That's it.

765
00:45:29,601 --> 00:45:32,000
That's how the story ends as a right now.

766
00:45:32,610 --> 00:45:33,443
Okay.

767
00:45:33,770 --> 00:45:37,770
That's how it's going to end.
I love it.

768
00:45:38,990 --> 00:45:43,710
That dead.
Do you believe is,

769
00:45:43,711 --> 00:45:47,130
I'm literally, I've route for a
franchise. It has six cups, you know,

770
00:45:47,131 --> 00:45:51,810
but we want in 2011. So that gives
me, that gives me rights. You know,

771
00:45:51,870 --> 00:45:55,320
whenever Montreal fans talk about
their fucking all the cups they want,

772
00:45:55,321 --> 00:46:00,250
I just started singing glory days.
That's all I do. It's really obnoxious.

773
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:01,900
It annoys the shit out of them.

774
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:04,180
They start wiping the tears
away with their little Hanky,

775
00:46:04,181 --> 00:46:07,180
say up in the front sport coat pockets.
Um,

776
00:46:07,420 --> 00:46:12,420
I was actually talking to Barton and
host of puck off and I was trying to tell

777
00:46:13,390 --> 00:46:16,030
him I was, you know, saying that
I was going to root for Toronto.

778
00:46:16,060 --> 00:46:20,200
So of course then they get the old right
there, Fred from fucking the capitals.

779
00:46:20,770 --> 00:46:22,570
Um, by the way, hey bill, who do
you think's gonna Win The cup?

780
00:46:22,571 --> 00:46:26,980
I think the penguins repeat. That's
what I think. That's what I think.

781
00:46:26,981 --> 00:46:30,130
I think they're gonna have an
amazing fucking series, um,

782
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:33,430
against the, uh, the capitals.

783
00:46:34,570 --> 00:46:39,540
And then they'll probably face
the fucking rangers. And, uh,

784
00:46:40,350 --> 00:46:43,410
who are they going to face in the
West? Well, who the fuck knows now?

785
00:46:44,770 --> 00:46:47,560
Nobody saw that four game
sweep against the Blackhawks.

786
00:46:48,370 --> 00:46:51,130
And I mean Noah saw that shit coming

787
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:54,940
fucking people in Nashville,
you know,

788
00:46:54,941 --> 00:46:57,670
they actually got this
such not hockey fans.

789
00:46:57,671 --> 00:46:59,290
They actually showed up for game five.

790
00:46:59,291 --> 00:47:00,880
They didn't know how
many games you had to win

791
00:47:05,620 --> 00:47:09,160
at such a cheap joke. But I enjoyed
it. Congratulations to Edmonton.

792
00:47:09,910 --> 00:47:14,370
Who else moved on Anaheim and I'm fucking
kicked the fuck out of somebody's St

793
00:47:14,370 --> 00:47:17,410
Louis Blues. You know, I guess I
got a roof for the blues again.

794
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:21,970
I'll root for the blue save and fuck,
they've never won a cup. And um,

795
00:47:22,780 --> 00:47:27,700
but anyways, I was talking to
Bartok, Joey Budnick and um,

796
00:47:28,350 --> 00:47:33,070
a lot of people don't this, um, cause
the May beliefs have not won since 1967.

797
00:47:33,910 --> 00:47:37,690
And I was surprised when I was going
back one day just going down some fucking

798
00:47:37,750 --> 00:47:41,650
hockey history, rabbit hole. And uh,

799
00:47:42,370 --> 00:47:45,840
do you know in 1967,
like

800
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:51,870
if you asked somebody like who
the greatest hockey franchise,

801
00:47:51,871 --> 00:47:53,730
the most successful one
of all fucking time,

802
00:47:53,970 --> 00:47:55,710
it would still would have
been the Canadians. Right?

803
00:47:55,711 --> 00:47:58,080
They'd still won the most cups.
But a lot of people don't know this.

804
00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:03,090
In 1967 the fucking maple
leafs for only one cup behind

805
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:08,050
the Montreal Canadians, they are now 10
cups behind him or something like that.

806
00:48:08,051 --> 00:48:10,120
11 cups, I believe. Yeah,

807
00:48:10,121 --> 00:48:15,121
24 to 13 in 1967 the fucking Toronto
Maple leafs won their 13th Stanley Cup to

808
00:48:18,861 --> 00:48:21,630
be within one of the Montreal Canadians.

809
00:48:21,631 --> 00:48:24,200
So that's like Celtics Lakers,

810
00:48:25,190 --> 00:48:28,040
except the maple leafs weren't
lying about any of their titles.

811
00:48:28,070 --> 00:48:30,980
They didn't win one in some other
fucking hockey league, you know,

812
00:48:31,790 --> 00:48:36,200
and then they called it a Stanley
Cup championship, you know. Anyways,

813
00:48:37,250 --> 00:48:40,700
so they went in in 1967 all right,

814
00:48:40,701 --> 00:48:45,650
the Katy is have 14 leaves, have 13
that breathing down their fucking necks.

815
00:48:47,030 --> 00:48:48,320
If they went to war,
right?

816
00:48:48,321 --> 00:48:50,870
All of a sudden they're the greatest
fucking franchise of all time.

817
00:48:50,900 --> 00:48:52,730
That's how fucking clothes they wear.

818
00:48:53,660 --> 00:48:54,493
Good.

819
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:59,180
And once again,
they aren't,

820
00:48:59,181 --> 00:49:02,120
they won the cup in
[inaudible] 67 the end.

821
00:49:03,230 --> 00:49:06,980
And that's the end of that book.
It's fucking unbelievable.

822
00:49:07,610 --> 00:49:11,060
And then the Canadians,
they want it the next two years in a row.

823
00:49:11,570 --> 00:49:15,890
68 69 then the Bruins one at 70. Oh
God, here we go. This is from memory.

824
00:49:15,891 --> 00:49:18,230
There's so much of a fucking nerd.
I am 71.

825
00:49:18,231 --> 00:49:21,380
The Canadians wind 72
[inaudible] 73 Canadians win.

826
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:26,560
Then the flyers went back to back
in 74 75 and then they fucking had,

827
00:49:27,940 --> 00:49:29,690
the Canadians had a dynasty 76,

828
00:49:29,691 --> 00:49:33,800
77 78 79 when Larry Robinson beat
the shit out of Dave Schultz.

829
00:49:34,370 --> 00:49:37,940
You know, both of them rocking the
same fucking perm. Both of them,

830
00:49:37,941 --> 00:49:42,200
I believe had a mustache. I
mean, it was, it was 1976.

831
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:46,400
You watch it now. They look like a couple
of roided up hipsters. But back then,

832
00:49:46,401 --> 00:49:49,250
that's what men look like. And he
stood up to them. And that was it.

833
00:49:49,251 --> 00:49:52,160
That's one of my favorite fucking moments,
by the way. That's as a Bruin fan.

834
00:49:52,190 --> 00:49:55,880
I love that fight. You know, just cause
you know, I don't know. I, I've, uh,

835
00:49:57,230 --> 00:49:58,160
I just don't like bullies.

836
00:49:58,190 --> 00:50:00,680
And I'm not saying Dave shelters or
bullets like you're playing fucking hockey

837
00:50:00,681 --> 00:50:04,640
for fuck sakes. Me. We
do mean to me, you know?

838
00:50:04,670 --> 00:50:06,710
But whenever they would call the bullies,
so it was just something about it.

839
00:50:06,711 --> 00:50:10,200
Like I just saw him pulling people's
hair and shit in. It was just like, uh,

840
00:50:10,250 --> 00:50:12,260
you know who's kidding,
who? I love Dave Schultz.

841
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:15,830
But after while you went so many fights,
you just start rooting for somebody else

842
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:18,193
anyways.

843
00:50:19,070 --> 00:50:23,600
Then they want an 86 then they won in 93
they want 10 more fucking Stanley cups

844
00:50:23,780 --> 00:50:27,740
and just, they just disappeared over
the horizon. It was like when Armstrong,

845
00:50:27,741 --> 00:50:31,190
look back at that guy,
you know when he went on,

846
00:50:31,191 --> 00:50:34,940
went on to win the Tour de
France like seven fucking times.

847
00:50:35,810 --> 00:50:38,110
I still can't believe they took
those titles away from it's so,

848
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:39,260
it's so fucking ridiculous.

849
00:50:40,090 --> 00:50:43,790
It's one of the dumbest things ever that
whole fucking sport is, is on drugs.

850
00:50:44,390 --> 00:50:47,150
They're all on drugs.
So it was a level playing field.

851
00:50:48,740 --> 00:50:49,910
Okay.
That's it.

852
00:50:52,370 --> 00:50:52,941
I'll tell you right now,

853
00:50:52,941 --> 00:50:56,270
if they all at the same people
raised okay and they all went clean,

854
00:50:56,271 --> 00:50:57,140
he's going to win it again.

855
00:50:58,400 --> 00:50:59,233
Right?

856
00:50:59,910 --> 00:51:04,750
He's the best guy. If they're all
on drugs. It was even, I don't know,

857
00:51:05,230 --> 00:51:06,850
that whole thing fucking annoys me.
You know why?

858
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,320
Because everybody
fucking shits on the guy.

859
00:51:08,321 --> 00:51:10,060
But everybody made all
this money off of them.

860
00:51:10,061 --> 00:51:13,480
You never saw anybody give any of
the fucking money back, did you? Oh,

861
00:51:13,580 --> 00:51:16,150
they were so fucking outreach.
Like the fucking cops who run this,

862
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:19,030
the sport of cycling didn't
realize what the fuck was going on.

863
00:51:19,860 --> 00:51:20,693
You know what I mean?

864
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:23,790
If someone were,
if somebody you work with,

865
00:51:23,791 --> 00:51:26,820
if you're in a restaurant and somebody
on fucking heroin at the staff,

866
00:51:26,821 --> 00:51:28,830
you know the people in
the restaurant don't know,

867
00:51:28,831 --> 00:51:30,450
but you fucking know
because you work there.

868
00:51:32,260 --> 00:51:36,430
They let that guy when seven in a row
blow up the fucking sport and then they

869
00:51:36,431 --> 00:51:38,620
took it away from,
and then they all kept in fucking money.

870
00:51:39,430 --> 00:51:41,690
That's exactly what happens as
far as I'm concerned. You know,

871
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:43,450
why isn't Trump go shoot
some missiles at them?

872
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:45,720
Yeah,
yeah.

873
00:51:46,790 --> 00:51:49,490
Um, anyways, I didn't know what the fuck
I'm talking about. Let me, let me, uh,

874
00:51:50,750 --> 00:51:54,590
let me fucking type in my goddamn
passport, passport, password.

875
00:51:55,990 --> 00:51:57,080
All the screen is just so cool.

876
00:51:57,130 --> 00:52:02,000
I never fucking wiped down the screen
fucking animal. I am never do it. I just,

877
00:52:02,001 --> 00:52:03,950
I'd rather squinty for some stupid reason.
All right,

878
00:52:03,951 --> 00:52:08,900
let's do a couple of questions here. All
right, big eyes follow up. Uh, Hi Bill.

879
00:52:08,930 --> 00:52:11,210
I listen to your podcast.
When you were going,

880
00:52:11,420 --> 00:52:15,500
when you were googling big eyes and heard
you mention the fiasco that occurred,

881
00:52:15,650 --> 00:52:16,640
which you dismissed,

882
00:52:16,641 --> 00:52:21,050
assuming that it wasn't the same artist
and actually there was a fraud involved.

883
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:23,870
The husband took credit
for the wife's artistry,

884
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:28,490
which came out after the images were
licensed. Love your podcast. Love you.

885
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:31,970
Go Fuck Yourself. And by the
way, I am a 62 year old woman.

886
00:52:32,630 --> 00:52:35,750
Oh God bless you sweetheart. Um,
yeah, I actually looked it up. Yeah,

887
00:52:35,751 --> 00:52:38,240
that guy was a fucking creep. Well,
we should put a link up to that.

888
00:52:38,241 --> 00:52:40,970
It's a crazy story.
Um,

889
00:52:41,240 --> 00:52:43,750
my favorite part of that story was,
uh,

890
00:52:44,990 --> 00:52:48,380
I forget there was some big fucking,
you know,

891
00:52:48,381 --> 00:52:53,240
one of those things that
like social lights show up
to those people who are just,

892
00:52:53,241 --> 00:52:55,280
you know, they just did famous
because people, they go to,

893
00:52:55,281 --> 00:52:58,230
these parties were famous,
people are there and day only.

894
00:52:58,270 --> 00:53:00,950
They just have a great conversation.

895
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:02,730
Okay.

896
00:53:02,730 --> 00:53:05,660
You know, they go in there and they talk
about fucking hot air ballooning or just

897
00:53:05,661 --> 00:53:07,310
something just, I don't know, they just,

898
00:53:07,311 --> 00:53:11,360
people just find them fascinating cause
they can go from subject to subject,

899
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:16,490
you know, while eating appetizers and
not getting anything between their teeth.

900
00:53:16,491 --> 00:53:20,620
They just, I don't know what it is about
fucking rich people. They are fascinated.

901
00:53:21,580 --> 00:53:24,470
I did say got so much fucking
money. They just get bored. Right.

902
00:53:24,650 --> 00:53:27,810
And God knows they're not talking
to their wives anymore. You know,

903
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:30,360
they went out and they got
themselves a mattress that, you know,

904
00:53:30,361 --> 00:53:34,560
two different kinds.
Right. Fucking banker.

905
00:53:34,561 --> 00:53:37,090
He probably wants a heated
one. The reptilian cunt. Um,

906
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:44,610
so I think, I don't know if it was the
world's fair, I don't know what it was,

907
00:53:44,611 --> 00:53:49,410
but they fucking bought, they had all the,
they bought some big, one of those big,

908
00:53:49,710 --> 00:53:53,700
I'd fucking kid paintings in somebody
in the New York Times and one of these

909
00:53:53,701 --> 00:53:58,701
fucking papers that all these fucking
socialite icons want that respect,

910
00:53:59,730 --> 00:54:04,590
trashed those drawings saying they're
creepy there hacky. It's awful.

911
00:54:04,591 --> 00:54:05,730
It's terrible art.

912
00:54:06,290 --> 00:54:09,210
The what happened was they just became
too mainstream and people got sick of

913
00:54:09,211 --> 00:54:12,120
them and they trashed him and then they
immediately took it down after they

914
00:54:12,121 --> 00:54:15,660
think they commissioned her to
fucking paint the goddamn thing. Um,

915
00:54:16,950 --> 00:54:21,210
I mean, what a fucking shame. One
article. It's like, you like that shit.

916
00:54:22,380 --> 00:54:25,230
You like that shit. And then you
walked, you commissioned that artists,

917
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:29,340
you told her how much you fucking liked
her and you appreciated her work in one

918
00:54:29,341 --> 00:54:31,230
little fucking article.
What did you do?

919
00:54:31,530 --> 00:54:34,830
All of a sudden you were like a fucking
kid in high school who wasn't strong

920
00:54:34,831 --> 00:54:37,820
enough to say, yeah, I'm friends with
that snot nose kid over there. Right.

921
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:40,980
And stayed with them.
You know, you didn't,

922
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:44,700
they just stepped away and they watched
dead lady gets stuffed into a fucking

923
00:54:44,701 --> 00:54:47,130
locker with all the goddamn paintings
have to, what the fuck happened?

924
00:54:47,131 --> 00:54:49,740
Her and her husband. I'll tell you
right now. That's reprehensible.

925
00:54:51,340 --> 00:54:51,760
Yeah.

926
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:55,910
All right. Captain America.
Everybody a Billy Bruce Banner.

927
00:54:56,630 --> 00:55:00,170
I don't imagine you're sending, spending
your free time reading comic books. Yeah,

928
00:55:00,171 --> 00:55:04,070
I can't get into them. I really
liked the way they're drawn the um,

929
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:06,680
and I also like the superhero
is always have like fucking,

930
00:55:06,770 --> 00:55:09,320
they have like the hottest girlfriends.
At least the ones that I read.

931
00:55:09,980 --> 00:55:14,970
Spiderman's girlfriend was
fucking ridiculous. Jesus Christ,

932
00:55:15,050 --> 00:55:19,640
the fucking titties. Acid legs. I mean she
was, she was fucking amazing. Beautiful,

933
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:23,930
beautiful God damn woman. Um,
that's why I don't like the movies,

934
00:55:23,931 --> 00:55:26,240
you know what I mean? Cause
nowadays, nowadays they take,

935
00:55:26,410 --> 00:55:30,590
they got to make sure they can't go to
fucking pretty now or also the fatties

936
00:55:30,591 --> 00:55:34,370
get fucking upset.
That's an impossible image.

937
00:55:34,590 --> 00:55:35,690
Check out in the fucking gym.

938
00:55:38,710 --> 00:55:42,700
Do I fucking cry when Brad Pitt
takes his shirt off? Maybe I do,

939
00:55:42,701 --> 00:55:47,680
but I don't tweet about it.
All right.

940
00:55:47,681 --> 00:55:50,410
I don't imagine you spending your
free time reading comic books bill.

941
00:55:50,411 --> 00:55:55,300
But I thought I'd share some news with
you, man. Uh, it was revealed months back.

942
00:55:56,610 --> 00:55:56,620
Uh,

943
00:55:56,620 --> 00:56:01,620
the captain America was actually
a Hydrus by all these years.

944
00:56:03,010 --> 00:56:05,320
Hydra is basically the Nazis.

945
00:56:06,940 --> 00:56:07,773
What?

946
00:56:08,860 --> 00:56:13,120
All right. It was assumed that they
would write it in that he was actually,

947
00:56:13,121 --> 00:56:16,810
he wasn't actually a spy this whole time,
but was pretending to be,

948
00:56:17,050 --> 00:56:22,030
well this month they decided to make
it so that captain America is and has

949
00:56:22,031 --> 00:56:26,560
always been a guy.
This story l elements,

950
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:31,480
they're adding our trash. So it's not
even a cool twist. Oh, I love, oh,

951
00:56:31,481 --> 00:56:35,650
is there anything better?
Is there anything better
than the, than the fucking,

952
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:41,450
the pissed off comic book reader with
the direction they've taken the story you

953
00:56:41,451 --> 00:56:45,100
like dead fucking Dolores, Clayborne,
whatever the fucking name is. Uh, misery,

954
00:56:45,880 --> 00:56:46,750
whatever the hell her name was.

955
00:56:51,870 --> 00:56:54,490
I whoop.
What else are they supposed to do?

956
00:56:55,060 --> 00:56:58,480
He's been a good guy for 100 fucking
years and I'm to tell you right now you

957
00:56:58,481 --> 00:57:01,150
fucking comic, but I'm might even
going to read the rest of us.

958
00:57:01,390 --> 00:57:05,500
You guys have I, you know, out of
respect. I'll read the last few.

959
00:57:06,560 --> 00:57:06,650
Okay,

960
00:57:06,650 --> 00:57:09,620
sentences here he goes,
I'm not a staunch Republican.

961
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:14,540
The fuck did my screen go. I'm not a
staunch republican or a wild southerner.

962
00:57:14,750 --> 00:57:19,750
I'm just a guy who is tired of this self
hating trend once with people hating

963
00:57:20,770 --> 00:57:25,220
traditions so much that they can't stand
a hero. Just being a hero. Oh, I see.

964
00:57:25,221 --> 00:57:27,350
You went in different directions.
This is good. Why red? Okay.

965
00:57:27,530 --> 00:57:29,780
I think you'd like some
of the newer comic titles,

966
00:57:30,110 --> 00:57:35,060
pictures and words and some good stories
makes for an easy stimulating read.

967
00:57:35,061 --> 00:57:39,410
Just don't read Captain America. Love you.
Love Nia. Congrats on the little lady.

968
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:43,670
Thank you sir. What's your dealing with?

969
00:57:43,720 --> 00:57:46,640
The here is money.
That's why they're doing it.

970
00:57:46,670 --> 00:57:51,440
They have exhausted every fucking
possible story, storyline.

971
00:57:51,470 --> 00:57:52,303
You know what I mean?

972
00:57:52,700 --> 00:57:56,330
Like you remember the Brady bunch when
they had to bring an Oliver, right?

973
00:57:57,410 --> 00:58:00,700
Remember like remember happy days, like
after awhile, like Ron Howard. He did.

974
00:58:00,840 --> 00:58:01,730
They did.
He just left.

975
00:58:01,731 --> 00:58:04,160
It's just like there's nothing left to
do with this character. I'm Outta here.

976
00:58:04,750 --> 00:58:06,560
And all of a sudden funds,
he started wearing suits.

977
00:58:06,561 --> 00:58:08,810
He was teaching a mechanic class.
He became a teacher.

978
00:58:10,990 --> 00:58:13,420
It's fucking hooligan, riding a
motorcycle. Next thing I know,

979
00:58:13,421 --> 00:58:18,100
he's pulling up in a station
wagon teaching this fucking
guy with blonde hair,

980
00:58:19,310 --> 00:58:21,740
how to fucking two and a carburetor and
he's actually helping them with their

981
00:58:21,741 --> 00:58:25,570
problems. All of a sudden it became like
welcome back Kotter. It's cause they,

982
00:58:25,571 --> 00:58:28,760
they were out of ideas that it had run
its course. And I hate to tell you this,

983
00:58:28,761 --> 00:58:33,180
but captain America has run
its fucking course. All right?

984
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:36,260
They're going to get themselves
out of this. All right?

985
00:58:37,190 --> 00:58:38,960
They'll do the classic thing that,
you know,

986
00:58:39,020 --> 00:58:41,750
it wasn't actually the real captain
America, it was fucking somebody else.

987
00:58:41,751 --> 00:58:45,810
But the thing is, dude, um, you are,

988
00:58:45,811 --> 00:58:47,930
who you should really blame is,
is Al Gore.

989
00:58:48,530 --> 00:58:51,740
He's the reason that this is all
going down because as we all know,

990
00:58:51,741 --> 00:58:54,830
Al Gore invented the Internet.
He said it himself,

991
00:58:55,550 --> 00:58:58,070
he said it himself and he said it again,
right?

992
00:58:58,070 --> 00:59:01,970
The man invented the Internet
and the Internet, you know,

993
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,130
gave birth to fucking Napster,

994
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:09,160
which gave birth to all of these things
where people could watch movies and shit

995
00:59:09,471 --> 00:59:13,340
for free. Right? Napster obviously
was music, but the other shit,

996
00:59:13,370 --> 00:59:15,680
people go on Pirate Bay,
they just watch all these movies for free.

997
00:59:15,860 --> 00:59:19,850
So what happened was that killed
the,

998
00:59:19,851 --> 00:59:23,960
the fucking 30 million to $70 million
movies. Like they just went away.

999
00:59:24,020 --> 00:59:29,020
So then everything became either super
fucking cheap or $100 million Superhero

1000
00:59:30,051 --> 00:59:31,850
fucking movie where it's like,
all right,

1001
00:59:31,851 --> 00:59:34,370
we're going to just spend all this
money and people are going to go,

1002
00:59:34,371 --> 00:59:38,960
cause they're gonna want to see special
effects in, you know, at the movie screen.

1003
00:59:38,990 --> 00:59:40,070
That's what happens.
So,

1004
00:59:40,360 --> 00:59:45,020
and they made 9,000 of
these fucking movies and,

1005
00:59:45,550 --> 00:59:48,020
um,
there's nowhere else to go with them.

1006
00:59:48,770 --> 00:59:50,930
I think they made a couple of
captain America movies, didn't they?

1007
00:59:50,990 --> 00:59:51,830
I don't fucking know.

1008
00:59:52,610 --> 00:59:55,970
But now what they're gonna do is they're
going to set this up that now this guy

1009
00:59:55,971 --> 01:00:00,480
is actually a fucking
Nazi, you know, and, uh,

1010
01:00:00,530 --> 01:00:03,170
who was doing all this great stuff
in America? I don't understand.

1011
01:00:03,171 --> 01:00:06,080
He was like saving children
while spying on us.

1012
01:00:06,081 --> 01:00:08,660
I don't know if they could somehow going
to try to explain all of that shit.

1013
01:00:08,690 --> 01:00:13,070
I have no idea. But eventually he's
going to fight Batman. All right?

1014
01:00:13,071 --> 01:00:17,540
We all know that Batman
has one professional fight
under his belt and he's all

1015
01:00:17,541 --> 01:00:20,420
for one, right? He launched a superman,

1016
01:00:21,650 --> 01:00:24,410
so before he gets another
shot at the title,

1017
01:00:24,411 --> 01:00:28,040
I think he has to fight somebody else.
Who's he going to fight? You know,

1018
01:00:28,100 --> 01:00:31,400
it can't be Lex Luther and
and fucking the octopus guy.

1019
01:00:31,430 --> 01:00:34,490
I mean those guys that played out
all right, they're all punch drunk,

1020
01:00:34,920 --> 01:00:38,000
spite of man's been fucking them up
for years. If they need somebody know,

1021
01:00:38,060 --> 01:00:40,550
so this is the only way to go.
All right?

1022
01:00:42,360 --> 01:00:45,810
I would be surprised if Vince McMahon
does not sue them for this storyline

1023
01:00:45,840 --> 01:00:50,190
because he did this with Hulk
Hogan like 50 times. You know?

1024
01:00:51,120 --> 01:00:54,690
You knew how Kogan was was.
You knew when he was the bad guy.

1025
01:00:54,691 --> 01:00:57,420
I love because he would
die the side of his beard.

1026
01:00:58,320 --> 01:01:01,890
He would die that fucking black and
then he would have the fucking blonde

1027
01:01:01,891 --> 01:01:04,740
mustache, which by the way,
I thought look really cool.

1028
01:01:05,310 --> 01:01:09,060
He had a great fucking fool
man shoe. He still does. Um,

1029
01:01:09,510 --> 01:01:11,610
do you ever see guy go bald
more gracefully than that?

1030
01:01:12,450 --> 01:01:15,300
He just kept pushing it back like Richard
Rawlings and every time he did it,

1031
01:01:15,301 --> 01:01:19,110
it was a little further back, you know?
Then he started wearing the fucking,

1032
01:01:19,770 --> 01:01:24,000
the scarves.
It always come off [inaudible] I dunno.

1033
01:01:24,610 --> 01:01:27,470
Tanned his head up. He looked
great. Then when you say that,

1034
01:01:28,590 --> 01:01:30,890
how Kogan went bald very gracefully.
What'd you say?

1035
01:01:32,110 --> 01:01:32,943
Yeah.

1036
01:01:33,530 --> 01:01:38,210
You don't think so? What's wrong with
you today? I feel like you don't like me.

1037
01:01:40,270 --> 01:01:42,460
I mean part of being married.
Some days you're not going to like me.

1038
01:01:42,461 --> 01:01:43,720
I feel like that's one of these days.

1039
01:01:44,210 --> 01:01:45,043
No,

1040
01:01:47,590 --> 01:01:50,320
I don't understand how you're
so loud with slippers on.

1041
01:01:53,060 --> 01:01:53,840
Okay.

1042
01:01:53,840 --> 01:01:55,370
She just said, that's why I
don't like you. All right.

1043
01:01:55,400 --> 01:01:57,950
Princess Kate finds parenting hard.

1044
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:05,360
Well, I imagine when they try to
play hide and go seek in that castle,

1045
01:02:05,480 --> 01:02:09,320
it's going to take forever. Hey Bill,
get a lot of this crap. Kate Middleton,

1046
01:02:10,100 --> 01:02:13,910
a fucking princess did a speech in which
she says she's finds it hard being a

1047
01:02:13,911 --> 01:02:18,560
mom. Now I'm sure she has a busy schedule,
but for Christ's sake she has servants.

1048
01:02:18,920 --> 01:02:22,340
I know she doesn't even have
nannies. She has servants. She,

1049
01:02:22,470 --> 01:02:25,140
it may have one of the easiest
jobs in the entire world.

1050
01:02:25,320 --> 01:02:28,440
She wasn't born to royal tree,
she married into it.

1051
01:02:28,650 --> 01:02:32,880
So all she needs to do is not be
a con for the next 50 to 75 years.

1052
01:02:33,030 --> 01:02:37,080
Stay married and she's all set.
Attached is a link to her full speech.

1053
01:02:37,081 --> 01:02:40,530
You can listen to it. Uh, if you care to
listen to it. I'm not listening to shit.

1054
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:44,100
She's trying to promote mental
health awareness, which is nice.

1055
01:02:44,101 --> 01:02:47,880
But did she really need to try to tell
us that she finds parenting difficult?

1056
01:02:48,120 --> 01:02:52,560
Huge fan from Newfoundland,
Canada. Thanks. And don't
forget to go fuck yourself.

1057
01:02:53,730 --> 01:02:56,160
Um, yeah. I mean, you know,

1058
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,280
this is the thing when a kid
comes into your life, yeah,

1059
01:03:00,330 --> 01:03:01,380
there's an adjustment period.

1060
01:03:01,410 --> 01:03:06,240
So she was sitting there getting fan by
feathers and all of that shit. Right.

1061
01:03:06,330 --> 01:03:08,730
Having somebody bring
her old Dagwood sandwich.

1062
01:03:10,990 --> 01:03:15,570
Is she sitting on, you know, the, the
Louis, the 15th fucking, I dunno, Ottoman.

1063
01:03:16,230 --> 01:03:19,800
Is that a word? Is that a piece
of furniture that is, isn't it?

1064
01:03:19,860 --> 01:03:23,430
Or is that an empire? Um, yeah.

1065
01:03:23,510 --> 01:03:26,070
And then all of a sudden the kids there
and she has to pretend to give a fuck

1066
01:03:26,080 --> 01:03:30,900
about, you know, I think it just
makes her photo shoots more difficult.

1067
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:35,990
What did she name her kids. He probably
gave him some old white guy's name, like

1068
01:03:38,300 --> 01:03:40,470
Winston Ebeneezer. The
fucking 19th or some shit. Um,

1069
01:03:42,290 --> 01:03:42,500
yeah.

1070
01:03:42,500 --> 01:03:43,910
The, I have to be honest with you, like,

1071
01:03:43,940 --> 01:03:47,840
that has to be the most boring fucking
life you could ever fucking live. Okay.

1072
01:03:49,180 --> 01:03:52,650
Being a fucking princess, at least when
you're a prince, you know, you get to eat.

1073
01:03:52,651 --> 01:03:56,080
He kept fucking guy goes around, he flies
helicopters. He was in the Goddamn army.

1074
01:03:56,770 --> 01:03:57,603
You know what I mean?

1075
01:03:59,060 --> 01:03:59,340
Yeah.

1076
01:03:59,340 --> 01:04:02,930
Goes out. He does shit right tags
out with the boys. He smoked cigars.

1077
01:04:02,940 --> 01:04:06,150
What do you do as a princess once
you fucking married, you know,

1078
01:04:06,151 --> 01:04:10,590
you broke down on the white horse, she
had your fucking, your wedding, right?

1079
01:04:10,591 --> 01:04:13,080
Everybody shows up,
you know,

1080
01:04:13,170 --> 01:04:15,780
all the women in the crowd giving you
the evil eye because they wanted to be a

1081
01:04:15,781 --> 01:04:18,660
princess. All the haters,
you know, there's,

1082
01:04:18,661 --> 01:04:20,730
there's nothing good about that ride in,
you know,

1083
01:04:20,731 --> 01:04:24,030
cause it's either going to be haters or
people just sobbing because that dream's

1084
01:04:24,031 --> 01:04:25,110
never going to happen for them.

1085
01:04:25,710 --> 01:04:29,550
So that's how he sees people stare and
stare and fucking daggers at you next to

1086
01:04:29,551 --> 01:04:31,120
fatties and fucking Weirdos like,

1087
01:04:33,150 --> 01:04:33,800
okay,

1088
01:04:33,800 --> 01:04:36,800
she's so beautiful.
Um,

1089
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:38,593
yeah.
Okay.

1090
01:04:38,640 --> 01:04:40,330
I would think it would
be hard to be a princess.

1091
01:04:40,680 --> 01:04:45,030
The steam mind numbingly boring fucking
life that you're going to live, you know,

1092
01:04:45,480 --> 01:04:50,100
to the, to the fuck. This is when you know
your board is when you promote a cause,

1093
01:04:50,910 --> 01:04:53,790
you know, you're so fucking bored.
You have to go out and help. Somebody

1094
01:04:57,130 --> 01:05:01,090
was so fucking all set is not what the,
there's nothing to do.

1095
01:05:02,510 --> 01:05:02,940
Hmm.

1096
01:05:02,940 --> 01:05:07,920
You know, there's nothing
you, we got everything you
fucking want. It's, it's, yeah,

1097
01:05:08,010 --> 01:05:12,230
the end game over now what are
you doing now? You got to fucking,

1098
01:05:12,360 --> 01:05:16,770
you got to go down to some third world
country and start installing plumbing or

1099
01:05:16,771 --> 01:05:19,090
some shit. [inaudible] got
it. You have to do something.

1100
01:05:20,860 --> 01:05:22,000
Either that or you just fucking,

1101
01:05:22,100 --> 01:05:24,850
you just become like one of
those Dudley Moore characters.

1102
01:05:24,851 --> 01:05:26,560
You just get shit faced every day.

1103
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:28,370
Okay.

1104
01:05:28,370 --> 01:05:32,640
That's what I would do. Take
up like archery and shit.
I just be in the backyard,

1105
01:05:32,690 --> 01:05:33,980
just fucking shoot and stuff.

1106
01:05:35,360 --> 01:05:37,940
Walking around with some
fucking ridiculous cognac.

1107
01:05:38,090 --> 01:05:42,760
I would be such a piece of Shit,
you know? I really would be, I, I,

1108
01:05:42,761 --> 01:05:44,750
if you know,
can you get written out of the will?

1109
01:05:45,170 --> 01:05:49,460
Can he get unfucking print x
prints or something like that?

1110
01:05:49,461 --> 01:05:52,700
Excommunicated from that. I, that's
exactly how I would do, oh my God,

1111
01:05:52,701 --> 01:05:56,720
I would have all the fucking sports
packages. I'd go to all the fucking games.

1112
01:05:57,720 --> 01:05:59,750
All right. I wouldn't give
a shit either. I would be,

1113
01:05:59,780 --> 01:06:04,070
I would be fucking ridiculously
blowing the money and like,

1114
01:06:04,100 --> 01:06:07,760
that would be my goal in life.
Like, how over can I be with

1115
01:06:09,710 --> 01:06:11,840
the English Tax Pique People's money that
they're there? What am I trying to say?

1116
01:06:12,050 --> 01:06:14,600
The English taxpayers' money.
There you go.

1117
01:06:15,710 --> 01:06:18,130
You ever seen somebody like dyslexic
when they're just talking about you?

1118
01:06:18,200 --> 01:06:21,710
You think I'm trying to read this shit.
Like always flip words around. Um,

1119
01:06:21,770 --> 01:06:23,720
and by all means,
all of you who aren't doctors,

1120
01:06:23,721 --> 01:06:26,780
please diagnose me and tell me what sort
of fish oil and I don't need to take

1121
01:06:26,850 --> 01:06:30,110
the cure it. Um, that's what
I would do. I would just like,

1122
01:06:30,890 --> 01:06:35,150
my goal would be by the time I'm 42, I
want them to, I could easily do that.

1123
01:06:36,380 --> 01:06:40,280
I can easily do that. I could get x
fucking, you know, you no longer at Duke,

1124
01:06:41,660 --> 01:06:42,493
you know.

1125
01:06:44,600 --> 01:06:47,450
Oh, you know what would be great. It'd be
great to, people would actually love you.

1126
01:06:47,480 --> 01:06:50,420
I want to say we've done Hayden.
You the second you walked into a pub,

1127
01:06:50,870 --> 01:06:55,770
you have no more security anymore. You
just come walking in and now, yeah,

1128
01:06:56,020 --> 01:06:59,420
you're, I fucked that one up there
yet pat, you'd be like, yeah, I did.

1129
01:06:59,750 --> 01:07:02,450
I had a great time though.
The fuck was I supposed to do?

1130
01:07:02,451 --> 01:07:07,420
I was living in a castle. You'd fucking
week. You know, that would be it.

1131
01:07:07,790 --> 01:07:08,361
The next,
you know,

1132
01:07:08,361 --> 01:07:12,320
you sit in the bleachers right in
the fucking pit at the footy games.

1133
01:07:12,860 --> 01:07:14,780
Just being a regular guy,
getting fucking hammered,

1134
01:07:14,940 --> 01:07:17,360
eating fish and chips and just laughing,

1135
01:07:17,840 --> 01:07:22,760
just laughing at how bad you fucked up
your life and all those fucking sad sex.

1136
01:07:22,761 --> 01:07:26,930
They'd love you. Um, anyways,

1137
01:07:27,410 --> 01:07:31,140
fat yoga instructor.
Hey Billy. Read Sec. Uh,

1138
01:07:35,280 --> 01:07:37,990
I don't know why that struck me so
funny. I mean, I see it everyday.

1139
01:07:38,200 --> 01:07:40,060
You think that that would be an old joke.
Uh,

1140
01:07:40,061 --> 01:07:45,061
I work out here in La as a
personal trainer and teach
them yoga classes here and

1141
01:07:45,081 --> 01:07:46,880
there.
Um,

1142
01:07:46,910 --> 01:07:50,540
I've been teaching yoga at this studio
for over four years and I got this fat

1143
01:07:50,541 --> 01:07:54,350
ass confer, a manager built, she's
gotta be 80 pounds overweight.

1144
01:07:54,351 --> 01:07:57,200
And despite being around
all this healthy lifestyle,

1145
01:07:57,410 --> 01:08:01,510
she has done nothing to improve herself.
I'm talking donuts and cookies in this.

1146
01:08:01,550 --> 01:08:05,480
I fucking loved this person. Oh my
God. I love both of these people.

1147
01:08:05,481 --> 01:08:07,850
I love that you call on a
route for being fat or him out.

1148
01:08:08,060 --> 01:08:11,240
And I love that this person's sitting
there fucking eating donuts in a yoga,

1149
01:08:12,070 --> 01:08:14,540
a yoga shop. What do you
call it? Studio Studio.

1150
01:08:15,170 --> 01:08:18,150
A dojo crib.
Uh,

1151
01:08:18,180 --> 01:08:22,160
I'm talking donuts and cookies in the
studio lobby around people that are there

1152
01:08:22,161 --> 01:08:25,820
to avoid these temptations.
That's fucking hilarious.

1153
01:08:27,230 --> 01:08:29,300
Anyways,
I've kept my mouth shut for years,

1154
01:08:29,301 --> 01:08:34,301
but recently we had our annual class
review with a manager comes and sees how,

1155
01:08:35,420 --> 01:08:36,530
how you class,

1156
01:08:36,590 --> 01:08:41,580
how your class is put together and how
you are with the students, et Cetera.

1157
01:08:42,040 --> 01:08:45,530
Uh, this whale couldn't even get
through the first 15 minutes.

1158
01:08:45,770 --> 01:08:50,360
She was beached on our mat belly.
She was beached on a mat belly up,

1159
01:08:50,361 --> 01:08:55,160
gulping fucking water. Oh, she went
into, yeah, she went into whale pose.

1160
01:08:58,380 --> 01:08:58,920
Okay.

1161
01:08:58,920 --> 01:09:02,910
Then afterwards she had the nerve
to criticize my class that it wasn't

1162
01:09:02,911 --> 01:09:07,320
challenging enough. Oh my God.
And you didn't say anything.

1163
01:09:09,510 --> 01:09:13,710
Okay. This is their reason that grudge is
being held. Okay. The, the, it should say,

1164
01:09:13,711 --> 01:09:17,580
the reason, the reason the grudge
is being held is that my aunt,

1165
01:09:17,610 --> 01:09:20,910
my annual raise was a mere 30 cents.

1166
01:09:22,290 --> 01:09:24,540
And I wonder if that
criticism effected it.

1167
01:09:25,640 --> 01:09:29,250
Give me that Billy Burger
philosophy on the, the situation.

1168
01:09:29,430 --> 01:09:32,760
Love the podcast.
Congratulations on the baby.

1169
01:09:32,761 --> 01:09:37,560
It was great hearing her on the podcast
the other day. Uh, go fuck yourself.

1170
01:09:37,561 --> 01:09:39,210
Fire Nips.
Um,

1171
01:09:39,240 --> 01:09:43,740
Jesus Christ really coming at me with the
fucking red head shit today aren't yet

1172
01:09:43,740 --> 01:09:48,690
. Um, I think the whole
thing is fucking hilarious.

1173
01:09:49,980 --> 01:09:51,300
Um, I gotta ask you something. All right?

1174
01:09:51,301 --> 01:09:55,130
You've been doing this shit
there for over four years. Uh,

1175
01:09:55,520 --> 01:09:59,880
why don't you eventually start
your own thing at this point,

1176
01:10:00,750 --> 01:10:04,830
you know, get out from that. This is
what, you know, what I would do if I was,

1177
01:10:04,831 --> 01:10:07,980
you get an a good grace has been,
you know,

1178
01:10:08,160 --> 01:10:12,960
just start bringing a donuts.
I bring a fudge, you know,

1179
01:10:13,560 --> 01:10:16,380
and just, you know, I don't
know if the cops could prove it,

1180
01:10:16,381 --> 01:10:21,180
but you just killer killer with what
she loves. Kill her with kindness.

1181
01:10:21,210 --> 01:10:25,050
Okay. There you go. Kill her with
kindness. Just keep what she gotta do.

1182
01:10:25,740 --> 01:10:29,260
Okay. This is the thing about those
fatties is that they can handle doughnuts,

1183
01:10:29,330 --> 01:10:32,910
all right? But I'm telling you right now,
nobody can handle fudge. Fudge is like,

1184
01:10:32,911 --> 01:10:35,040
it's like a,
it's almost a hundred percent sugar.

1185
01:10:36,270 --> 01:10:39,240
It's like a solid form of cotton
candy with like chocolate in it.

1186
01:10:39,241 --> 01:10:43,530
I mean it is fucking, you can't even
eat it. Like you'd hope face puckers up.

1187
01:10:44,760 --> 01:10:48,900
This is what you do. You come
in, you make a tray of fudge,

1188
01:10:49,660 --> 01:10:53,340
all right? You cut a piece
out. This is what you do, okay?

1189
01:10:53,370 --> 01:10:56,610
You cut a fucking piece out.
All right? And just, you know,

1190
01:10:56,611 --> 01:10:59,430
give it to the birds or some shit,
right? I think sugar's good for them.

1191
01:10:59,431 --> 01:11:01,590
I can't remember.
See the good or it kills them either way.

1192
01:11:01,591 --> 01:11:03,060
Just give it to the fucking birds,
right?

1193
01:11:04,650 --> 01:11:07,440
Then you bring the fudge in this and now
it looks like somebody already took a

1194
01:11:07,441 --> 01:11:10,120
piece of, she's not going to feel
guilty and I guaran fucking tee you.

1195
01:11:10,680 --> 01:11:15,600
I guarantee you do in the sugar is going
to fuck with the joints. All right?

1196
01:11:15,900 --> 01:11:19,950
Then you come in with some
bacon sub sandwiches. You
just keep going. Sugar, salt,

1197
01:11:19,951 --> 01:11:22,530
sugar, salt, sugar, salt.
Okay. And just, you know,

1198
01:11:22,950 --> 01:11:24,720
that 30 cents they should have given you,

1199
01:11:24,870 --> 01:11:28,980
you take 30 another 30 cents out of
your fucking check every goddamn hour,

1200
01:11:29,510 --> 01:11:30,840
all right? And, and you,

1201
01:11:30,841 --> 01:11:34,290
you put it towards giving this
person food that'll slowly kill him.

1202
01:11:35,270 --> 01:11:36,103
There you go.

1203
01:11:37,710 --> 01:11:40,980
Or you get a new job.

1204
01:11:43,090 --> 01:11:47,680
I Dunno. I just, I just think killing her.
Be Funny. All right. Just your daughter,

1205
01:11:48,220 --> 01:11:50,730
a Billy Bathgate's.
Uh,

1206
01:11:50,740 --> 01:11:55,120
would you ever disown your daughter if she
brought home a. Dot. Dot. Dot. Dot, dot,

1207
01:11:55,121 --> 01:11:58,840
dot, dot, dot, dot, dot,
dot, dot. Dot. Hack comic.

1208
01:12:00,430 --> 01:12:05,170
Oh Jesus. Think of the hackiest type of
comic you can think of. And in the future,

1209
01:12:05,171 --> 01:12:07,990
she brought him home talking
about how she loves him.

1210
01:12:08,200 --> 01:12:12,610
And now he's the funniest
comic ever. Uh, Oh God.

1211
01:12:12,910 --> 01:12:16,780
He's got a youtube channel, tells
jokes with the lampshade on his head.

1212
01:12:16,960 --> 01:12:21,220
It's Cetera. She asks you
what you think of him. Uh,

1213
01:12:21,221 --> 01:12:23,920
you tell her is a hack
she gets mad at you,

1214
01:12:24,250 --> 01:12:28,400
tells you you don't understand him
and how he's funnier than you. Uh,

1215
01:12:28,480 --> 01:12:31,810
would you dishonor and tell her she
can't bring the hack into what's out now?

1216
01:12:31,870 --> 01:12:34,870
No jokes. Leaf. Yeah. Joke. Thief.
He can't come into the house.

1217
01:12:35,800 --> 01:12:38,320
You can't come into my house
is a fucking joke. Thief. Um,

1218
01:12:40,410 --> 01:12:40,690
okay.

1219
01:12:40,690 --> 01:12:44,330
Uh, I, this is what I would do. You know
what? Even even if he stole fucking jokes,

1220
01:12:44,810 --> 01:12:47,510
I know he's going to get caught and
people are going to call them out on it.

1221
01:12:47,540 --> 01:12:49,850
I wouldn't say anything, Eric.
Cause I'll tell you this, I,

1222
01:12:49,900 --> 01:12:54,170
I've seen how that goes down when you
say you don't like somebody that you kid,

1223
01:12:54,470 --> 01:12:58,310
like, you know what I mean? And uh,
then there's all those in law problems.

1224
01:12:58,400 --> 01:13:03,290
All right? This is your job as a
parent is you gotta Trust your kids.

1225
01:13:04,220 --> 01:13:08,690
Decisionmaking all right? They love
the guy. You just got to go with it.

1226
01:13:09,290 --> 01:13:13,250
You know what I mean? And then if they
get divorced, you can't be like, hey,

1227
01:13:13,251 --> 01:13:17,360
you know, I was, you know, cause if
but why did you fucking say something?

1228
01:13:17,690 --> 01:13:22,310
Cause you'd hate me. Um, Jesus, why
would you bring that up? I'm, I'm just,

1229
01:13:22,730 --> 01:13:26,660
I'm three months into this. I want
to enjoy my, my daughter growing up.

1230
01:13:27,080 --> 01:13:30,620
Jesus Christ. You already got me
picture of being at the fucking wedding.

1231
01:13:32,110 --> 01:13:35,140
You know the guy would have some
fucking crazy colored fucking bow tie.

1232
01:13:35,380 --> 01:13:39,880
The cumber Bun. All right. I don't
know Jesus Christ. What a way to end.

1233
01:13:40,840 --> 01:13:44,830
Um, by the way, uh, how about the Celtic
sound coming back when in two games,

1234
01:13:44,831 --> 01:13:48,640
how lucky did we get with Rondo
going down Jesus Christ, by the way,

1235
01:13:48,641 --> 01:13:51,430
he pulled off a short sleeve suit.
I don't know how he did it.

1236
01:13:51,700 --> 01:13:53,170
He actually fucking look cool.

1237
01:13:55,300 --> 01:13:59,430
I think you had to have a cast on
to make it work though. Like he did.

1238
01:13:59,431 --> 01:14:03,880
He fucked up his stomach assumption.
All Right Patrice, dear Billy, big tits.

1239
01:14:04,360 --> 01:14:08,630
Hey, I'm losing weight yet. Con found this
on youtube almost shit myself laughing.

1240
01:14:08,631 --> 01:14:10,060
I thought you'd appreciate this.

1241
01:14:10,420 --> 01:14:14,530
Some classic hope you enjoy and go fuck
yourself. I will definitely retweet this.

1242
01:14:14,880 --> 01:14:17,960
Um, thank you for sending that in. Um,

1243
01:14:19,730 --> 01:14:23,140
you know, it's always great that people
are still watching his shit and uh,

1244
01:14:23,150 --> 01:14:26,270
I'm always talking about them and that
type of stuff that keeps his comedy alive.

1245
01:14:26,630 --> 01:14:29,360
I know that's all cliched stuff,
but like I was talking to,

1246
01:14:30,500 --> 01:14:32,690
I was actually talking to Bart,
Nick and Andrew last night,

1247
01:14:32,691 --> 01:14:36,680
a bottom in the green room and I was
just talking, just saying how, um,

1248
01:14:38,770 --> 01:14:42,910
just what a fucking,
just still like crater comedy.

1249
01:14:42,911 --> 01:14:47,800
Fucking crater. What a fucking
lost that was, man, it's just a,

1250
01:14:47,810 --> 01:14:51,550
that guy was so much,
he was so much better than all of us.

1251
01:14:51,760 --> 01:14:56,290
It was fucking ridiculous.
And um, I'm telling you,

1252
01:14:56,291 --> 01:15:00,700
even in, even as great as elephant
in the room is, I'm telling you he's,

1253
01:15:01,900 --> 01:15:03,510
he effortlessly cook.

1254
01:15:03,820 --> 01:15:06,940
His next special would've been at least
fucking 30% funnier than that one.

1255
01:15:07,210 --> 01:15:09,280
That's the trajectory
that that guy was on.

1256
01:15:09,940 --> 01:15:14,560
And I'm a fucking kills me, man.
Fucking kills me. So anyways,

1257
01:15:14,590 --> 01:15:18,250
that's the podcast for this week.
I'll check in on you on Thursday.

1258
01:15:19,600 --> 01:15:22,870
Uh, please check out. Return to
the Mac. The first couple episodes,

1259
01:15:22,871 --> 01:15:26,560
it's streaming on something. I
don't fucking know anymore. Um,

1260
01:15:27,190 --> 01:15:31,330
very funny and my apologies to
Joe McIntyre for standard. Yep.

1261
01:15:31,331 --> 01:15:33,390
Last week I really fucked that
up and he couldn't, you know,

1262
01:15:33,510 --> 01:15:36,350
what's the worst part? He was totally
cool about it because no one, no worries,

1263
01:15:36,400 --> 01:15:39,120
