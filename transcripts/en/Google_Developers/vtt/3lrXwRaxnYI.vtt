LEON ZHAO: [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:00:10.365 --> 00:00:10.865
OK.

00:00:10.865 --> 00:00:12.580
It's show time.

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:14.340
[SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.100
Please give a self
introduction for yourself,

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.500
and then we'll go
through the slides.

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:28.680
KOH KIM: My name is Koh Kim.

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.260
I'm part of the Google Play
Games business development team

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.630
in Mountain View, California.

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:37.672
I cover the United States and
a lot of our Western markets

00:01:37.672 --> 00:01:39.880
and work with games startups
from all over the world.

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:45.140
YOSHI: My name is Yoshi.

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.920
I'm working for Google Play apps
and games for the Japan market,

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.450
so I'm based in
Tokyo and consulting

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:57.720
the Japanese developers, as
well as the [INAUDIBLE] who want

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:00.950
to enter the Japanese market.

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:02.070
KH: My name is KH.

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.290
I'm based in Seoul, Korea.

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.220
I'm working for [INAUDIBLE]
games business in Korea.

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:15.870
So I'm helping import and
export process for all contents

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:22.174
and then helping our
overall ecosystem better.

00:02:22.174 --> 00:02:24.910
KEVIN: [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.930
LEON ZHAO: Thanks
for the introduction.

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:36.030
[SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.120
Let's start with the slides.

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.505
So Koh.

00:02:40.505 --> 00:02:43.130
KOH KIM: So I'm going to talk a
little bit about the US market,

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:44.860
and then after this, Europe.

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:47.090
And so this is just
an example of some

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.200
of the more popular games.

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.810
Actually, games and applications
that are in the United States.

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:56.149
You may recognize the "Clash
of Clans," "Candy Crush Saga."

00:02:56.149 --> 00:02:57.940
But it's just to note
that there's actually

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.270
a very diverse range
of game genres that

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:04.670
are very popular in the US,
ranging from the casual Match 3

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:07.680
Puzzle Games all the
way to the City Builder

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.910
simulation and strategy
games that you often would

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:10.630
[INAUDIBLE].

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:13.320
But actually, another one of
our popular-- casino games

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:13.970
are popular.

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:15.660
We also have drawn
representations

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:19.090
from many developers
from all over the world.

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:22.440
Not just from Europe,
but also from Japan

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.330
and the rest of Asia, as well.

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:26.360
And also, applications
are very popular.

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:29.090
And so Pandora's one example.

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:31.840
People in the United States,
they love their music.

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.750
They love their social and
communication applications.

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:37.270
The engagement is really high
in applications like that,

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:40.310
and so there's a lot of
opportunity to find success

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:42.930
in the US market.

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:45.717
Just as I said, for
games, diverse genres.

00:03:45.717 --> 00:03:48.050
Some of the other things that
have been very interesting

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:50.900
is that there's a lot
of multiplayer games.

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:52.710
Before it's been
mostly asynchronous,

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:53.670
single player games.

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:56.670
But now, with better
infrastructure and broadband

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:59.750
networks, you're seeing a lot
more synchronous or real time

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:00.780
multiplayer games.

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:02.571
And so a lot of the
games that are actually

00:04:02.571 --> 00:04:05.520
popular in this country, such
as action RPGs and all of that

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:09.712
are actually slowly making their
way into the United States.

00:04:09.712 --> 00:04:11.670
Some of the other stuff
we wanted to talk about

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:14.290
is non-games-- so just regular
applications, as I said.

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:17.240
Communication, social
applications are very popular.

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:19.800
There's probably a new
picture taking, photo taking,

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:22.770
video taking application
that shows up every week.

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:25.282
There's a lot of high
engagement in that front.

00:04:25.282 --> 00:04:27.490
And there's also a really
big growth of, I would say,

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:29.700
mobile, social
commerce, as well.

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:31.700
A lot of friends,
a lot of people

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:34.050
are recommending what
types of things to buy

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:36.680
and what types of products to
buy via these social networks.

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:39.480
And so that's been very
interesting to take a look at.

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:41.770
In terms of payments,
credit cards

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:43.830
are very ubiquitous
in the United States.

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:45.640
People are not afraid
to use credit cards

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:46.910
for digital payments.

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:51.527
But there's also a wide usage
of carrier billing, and also

00:04:51.527 --> 00:04:52.360
gift cards, as well.

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:56.150
But definitely, credit cards is
the predominant payment method.

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:58.520
So let's talk a little
bit about Europe.

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:02.310
Europe is very similar
to the United States.

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:03.520
Pretty diverse range.

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:05.110
But there's a couple
of differences.

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:08.810
There's a lot more hard core
strategy games that are seen,

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:10.395
mostly of the Western fantasy.

00:05:10.395 --> 00:05:13.460
So you think of the knights,
the dragons, the King Arthur,

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:14.040
Camelot.

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:19.310
A lot of that mythology, you
will see as themes in games.

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:22.180
"Empire Four Kingdoms" is
an example of that-- a lot

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:25.100
of medieval themes that
occurs in those games.

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:26.970
But then you see a lot
of other games too.

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:29.560
You see Top Eleven, which
is a top soccer game there.

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:31.960
And so they actually really
like their sports simulation

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:33.930
and football manager
games in Europe.

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:36.330
And so that's also something
to take note of, as well.

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:39.010
And start talking a little
bit about market trends.

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:40.810
If I'm talking too
fast, let me know.

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:43.040
I'm trying to get
through a lot of this.

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:46.991
LEON ZHAO: If the translator
is OK, then that'll be fine.

00:05:46.991 --> 00:05:47.490
KOH KIM: OK.

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:50.600
But let me know if
I'm talking too fast.

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:53.180
For a lot of games, as
I said, very similar

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:54.480
to the United States.

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:57.560
Certain sports games do become
a lot more popular, especially

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:58.620
soccer.

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:01.000
It's religion there, so
a lot of soccer games

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.050
are very popular there.

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:03.430
And also, if you look at
the application store,

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:04.530
it's very similar tastes.

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:07.330
But it's not the US version
of those applications

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:08.450
that are popular.

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:11.720
There's actually local
versions of, let's say,

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:14.860
the social networks, or some
of the photo taking apps,

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:17.110
and the Instagrams
and all that stuff.

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:19.120
And even music
apps, as well, they

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:20.340
tend to be like very local.

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:22.070
A lot of the more
popular music apps

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:24.460
such as Spotify and
SoundCloud have actually

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:26.220
been created in Europe.

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:29.050
In terms of payments,
there are some differences.

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:30.650
Versus credit cards,
actually, there's

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:32.950
a lot more prepaid gift
cards and Paypal usage

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:34.190
that's occurred in Europe.

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:36.189
But that's just a matter
of consumer preference.

00:06:38.012 --> 00:06:38.720
LEON ZHAO: Yoshi?

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:43.660
YOSHI: So I would
like to explain

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:45.060
about the Japanese market.

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:50.490
So this is the top ranking
of the last week in Japan.

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:56.000
So compared with the US
and the European's ranking

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.330
is totally different.

00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:02.620
Probably in here the atendee
is familiar a little bit

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:04.340
with the characters.

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:07.810
And of course, the [INAUDIBLE]
is a pretty long life.

00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:11.310
And they make it in a good
business end Japan market.

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:17.900
And also, those
titles are all almost

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:21.670
from the Japanese market,
Japanese developers.

00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:25.860
And a recent trend of the
Japanese game industry

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:32.030
is that much players is
super trending right now.

00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:35.310
So first of all, they're
most of it's making

00:07:35.310 --> 00:07:37.140
the much players,
cultures, bringing

00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:38.940
into the smartphone in Japan.

00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:44.540
Then many game developers
are following those trends

00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:47.090
right now in the Japan market.

00:07:47.090 --> 00:07:53.210
And also, the Japanese
market is quite

00:07:53.210 --> 00:07:56.040
different compare with
the other markets which

00:07:56.040 --> 00:08:03.140
is that users prefer to play
in the co-op or much player

00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:05.640
and not fight each other.

00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:09.320
It's more like corporations,
and much player,

00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:13.490
and [INAUDIBLE] are
making a [? boss ?]

00:08:13.490 --> 00:08:15.300
or making it clear as a stage.

00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:18.230
That's the trend of
the Japanese market.

00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:20.540
Also, generally, in
the Japan market,

00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:25.940
the localization is mandatory
to get into the Japan market.

00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:30.620
So once the user
who lives in Japan

00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:35.445
recognizes that this is
from the outside of Japan,

00:08:35.445 --> 00:08:37.309
or the culture is
for the Japan market,

00:08:37.309 --> 00:08:39.570
then the user will leave.

00:08:39.570 --> 00:08:43.909
So I recommend if you want
to come to the Japan market,

00:08:43.909 --> 00:08:46.780
their localization is
the most important thing

00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:49.060
to get into the Japan market.

00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:52.910
And the game system,
it's pretty complicated.

00:08:52.910 --> 00:08:56.070
But the casual games,
plus gacha system,

00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:59.480
plus merge evolution grows.

00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:02.600
It's pretty popular in
Japan, and the live operation

00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:03.580
is important too.

00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:06.950
So in terms of the
live operations,

00:09:06.950 --> 00:09:11.120
so many live operations
[INAUDIBLE] in the one game,

00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:15.870
like 20 live operations in the
one game in [? Delhi. ?] That's

00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:18.430
your usual in the Japan market.

00:09:18.430 --> 00:09:24.060
So live operation is quite
difficult to operate.

00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:28.600
But that's making the
user retention go up.

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:30.480
That's your things.

00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:34.345
And the non-games
side, the subscription

00:09:34.345 --> 00:09:38.380
shown business model is
pretty popular in Japan,

00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:40.550
because the Japanese
users are pretty

00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:45.610
familiar with payment pay
[? date ?] mobile contents,

00:09:45.610 --> 00:09:49.290
since the feature
phone mobile contents,

00:09:49.290 --> 00:09:52.630
which is [INAUDIBLE]
system was in there.

00:09:52.630 --> 00:09:56.650
And also, the users only
choice is subscription.

00:09:56.650 --> 00:09:59.010
Then the user moves
to the smart phone.

00:09:59.010 --> 00:10:01.820
Then they're
familiar with payment

00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:04.510
to the digital contents
with subscription.

00:10:04.510 --> 00:10:06.580
That's your trend right now.

00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:08.140
And also, the
education and shopping

00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:11.630
is getting popular on
the smartphone, as well.

00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:16.210
That's pretty similar with
the US market, I guess.

00:10:16.210 --> 00:10:19.325
And then payment system,
that I direct carrier billing

00:10:19.325 --> 00:10:22.690
and a Google Play gift
card, all payment system

00:10:22.690 --> 00:10:24.550
is available in Japan.

00:10:24.550 --> 00:10:31.820
But a Japanese user is
allowed to pay the money

00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:35.820
on direct [INAUDIBLE] billing.

00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:37.090
LEON ZHAO: KH?

00:10:37.090 --> 00:10:39.445
So it's actually easy
to remember KH's name,

00:10:39.445 --> 00:10:43.330
because he's responsible
for for Korea.

00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:47.470
KH: So actually, the
screen that you're seeing,

00:10:47.470 --> 00:10:51.820
we announced the best
application and games of 2014

00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:52.770
last week.

00:10:52.770 --> 00:10:57.460
And then those are
our best game titles

00:10:57.460 --> 00:11:01.070
and applications of 2014.

00:11:01.070 --> 00:11:04.400
For the Korean market,
actually, the last year,

00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:08.220
we saw a huge growth
with social games.

00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:09.470
There are many positive games.

00:11:09.470 --> 00:11:13.870
But this year, we saw that the
market changed very quickly.

00:11:13.870 --> 00:11:19.970
So the most popular genre
is action RPG or MMORPG.

00:11:19.970 --> 00:11:25.640
So you can see that
[INAUDIBLE], for example, there

00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:29.280
are some very popular
RPG titles in the chart.

00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:31.492
And then for sure,
"Clash of Clan,"

00:11:31.492 --> 00:11:32.950
they're working
very well in Korea.

00:11:32.950 --> 00:11:37.500
So actually, they have been the
number one placement of our top

00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:39.925
[INAUDIBLE] for awhile.

00:11:39.925 --> 00:11:41.140
The next slide please?

00:11:41.140 --> 00:11:42.060
LEON ZHAO: Sure.

00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:45.200
KH: So the hardcore action
RPG are very popular.

00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:47.700
And then for those
game developers,

00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:52.990
their common marketing strategy
is to have preregistrations.

00:11:52.990 --> 00:11:56.210
So that's a common activity.

00:11:56.210 --> 00:12:01.070
And also, the one unique
fact for a Korean market

00:12:01.070 --> 00:12:04.720
is when you think of entering
the Korean market you need

00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:07.880
to have a lot of content,
because Korean users,

00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:09.280
they're very aggressive.

00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:12.780
They consume every
content in a week,

00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:18.170
so you need to
think of preparing

00:12:18.170 --> 00:12:21.230
enough content for the titles.

00:12:21.230 --> 00:12:24.110
And for sure, going
global initiative

00:12:24.110 --> 00:12:27.000
is the main agenda
for Korean developers.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:32.900
For non-game side, the
O2O service is very hot.

00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:35.470
So for example, food
delivery service

00:12:35.470 --> 00:12:38.300
is very competitive in Korea.

00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:42.770
So many companies are
thinking of connecting offline

00:12:42.770 --> 00:12:46.860
to mobile-- that is, mainstream.

00:12:46.860 --> 00:12:50.630
And also, for Uber,
there's Uber in Korea.

00:12:50.630 --> 00:12:54.570
But also, there are other
Uber-like services emerging.

00:12:54.570 --> 00:12:58.880
So that kind of O2O is
very important in Korea.

00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:02.590
Also, because we have
a very high ratio

00:13:02.590 --> 00:13:06.180
of high penetration
of credit cards,

00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:10.250
the m-commerce is
soaring in Korea too.

00:13:10.250 --> 00:13:14.390
Other than that, the
lifestyle utility applications

00:13:14.390 --> 00:13:16.210
is getting more
popular and popular.

00:13:16.210 --> 00:13:19.890
For payment, we just launched
Google Gift Card last month

00:13:19.890 --> 00:13:23.360
and with that, direct carrier
billing and credit card.

00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:26.030
Those three are the
main forms of payment

00:13:26.030 --> 00:13:28.340
for the Korean market.

00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:31.040
LEON ZHAO: OK, Kevin?

00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:33.960
KEVIN: So I took this
screenshot last week,

00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:37.150
and I think it's just
games, not apps and games.

00:13:37.150 --> 00:13:39.950
So I apologize for
anyone who's in apps.

00:13:39.950 --> 00:13:43.660
But the only difference between
this chart and the apps chart

00:13:43.660 --> 00:13:48.040
is that it's just one
app, and that's Line.

00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:51.290
So there are no other
apps in the top grossing,

00:13:51.290 --> 00:13:52.540
I don't think other than that.

00:13:52.540 --> 00:13:56.910
The top 100 grossing
apps and games in Taiwan,

00:13:56.910 --> 00:14:00.630
there's only one app,
and that is Line.

00:14:00.630 --> 00:14:03.580
And so if you look
here, Taiwan's

00:14:03.580 --> 00:14:05.730
a very interesting market.

00:14:05.730 --> 00:14:08.860
Notibably missing from this
list is a lot of Western titles.

00:14:08.860 --> 00:14:10.700
"Candy Crush" is the
only Western title.

00:14:10.700 --> 00:14:12.050
There's no "Clash of Clans."

00:14:12.050 --> 00:14:14.010
There's no "Machine Zone."

00:14:14.010 --> 00:14:17.110
There's none of these
bigger, Western devs

00:14:17.110 --> 00:14:20.780
that have gone
global to Taiwan yet.

00:14:20.780 --> 00:14:22.350
Next slide?

00:14:22.350 --> 00:14:27.780
So unlike Japan and Korea
though, there's no incumbent.

00:14:27.780 --> 00:14:29.980
There hasn't been a
number one grosser

00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:33.940
that stays in that spot,
whereas in other markets

00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:35.940
around the world,
you might actually

00:14:35.940 --> 00:14:42.590
see-- GungHo and Mixi don't
really move that much.

00:14:42.590 --> 00:14:45.570
And they might switch
between one and two.

00:14:45.570 --> 00:14:50.800
But they've been number
one for weeks, or maybe

00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:52.180
more than that-- maybe months.

00:14:52.180 --> 00:14:55.930
And in Taiwan, that
chart, if you go back

00:14:55.930 --> 00:15:01.250
one slide, the 1 through
5-- actually, 1 through 7

00:15:01.250 --> 00:15:05.240
have all switched spots
pretty much every week.

00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:06.800
So based on their
event schedule,

00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:10.420
when I took this, "LINE Rangers"
just did a major event--

00:15:10.420 --> 00:15:12.570
big sale, live operations.

00:15:12.570 --> 00:15:14.791
But before this,
they were number 10.

00:15:14.791 --> 00:15:17.290
So they went to number 10 to
number 2 when they do an event,

00:15:17.290 --> 00:15:19.160
and then they drop
back to 10 after this.

00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:20.930
So if you look at it
right now, they're

00:15:20.930 --> 00:15:23.350
probably not even top 10.

00:15:23.350 --> 00:15:28.090
So if you go back
to the next slide--

00:15:28.090 --> 00:15:31.900
so the interesting thing
is that Taiwan is now

00:15:31.900 --> 00:15:36.620
a top five global revenue
market for Google Play.

00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:41.470
There's been an increase of
25% of Chinese-- [CHINESE]--

00:15:41.470 --> 00:15:44.820
mainland Chinese developers
and top grossing since

00:15:44.820 --> 00:15:46.840
the beginning of
this year alone.

00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:49.060
So a lot more of the
Chinese developers

00:15:49.060 --> 00:15:53.080
are now coming to Taiwan
whereas before, it was mostly

00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:55.810
Taiwanese developers or
Taiwanese publishers,

00:15:55.810 --> 00:15:58.090
and Japan and Korea in content.

00:16:01.150 --> 00:16:05.050
So as you can tell,
Japan and Korea,

00:16:05.050 --> 00:16:06.850
the content is very prevalent.

00:16:06.850 --> 00:16:10.010
But a lot of times, the
monetization model in Taiwan

00:16:10.010 --> 00:16:11.470
is a lot different.

00:16:11.470 --> 00:16:13.590
One of the things I've
noticed as a consumer,

00:16:13.590 --> 00:16:17.800
playing a lot of Chinese
games, is basically,

00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:20.090
I might play the Japanese
version of the game.

00:16:20.090 --> 00:16:24.030
And then I play the Taiwanese
version of the same game.

00:16:24.030 --> 00:16:28.180
And the monetization model,
if they don't change it,

00:16:28.180 --> 00:16:31.020
it doesn't do that well in
terms of top grossing charts.

00:16:31.020 --> 00:16:32.530
The game is still fun.

00:16:32.530 --> 00:16:37.200
But I think it's a lot because
of the gacha system in Japan.

00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:40.950
If I spend a lot of
money to buy something,

00:16:40.950 --> 00:16:45.420
I expect to get something
worth that value.

00:16:45.420 --> 00:16:47.130
[SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:16:53.670 --> 00:16:55.970
That's very normal in
Japan, where you might just

00:16:55.970 --> 00:16:58.690
do gacha over and over,
and you never win anything.

00:16:58.690 --> 00:17:00.500
And they'll keep spending.

00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:05.069
But in Chinese, I feel
like if we spend $100,

00:17:05.069 --> 00:17:06.690
we expect to get an item.

00:17:06.690 --> 00:17:08.690
LEON ZHAO: So the Chinese
don't believe in luck?

00:17:12.619 --> 00:17:14.119
KEVIN: It's just
one of those things

00:17:14.119 --> 00:17:17.500
that you always want to keep in
mind of the monetization model

00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:18.000
too.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:22.450
Also, competition is very
fierce between people,

00:17:22.450 --> 00:17:24.250
whereas Yoshi just
said, everybody

00:17:24.250 --> 00:17:26.089
wants to work together in Japan.

00:17:26.089 --> 00:17:28.010
And Taiwan and Hong
Kong games, or at least

00:17:28.010 --> 00:17:30.420
in Chinese developer
games, I notice that it's

00:17:30.420 --> 00:17:31.470
all about competition.

00:17:31.470 --> 00:17:32.470
I want to be the best.

00:17:32.470 --> 00:17:33.720
I don't want to work together.

00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:35.180
I want to be the best.

00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:39.560
So it's also interesting to
note that Taiwanese people spend

00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:41.880
most of the time on
their mobile devices

00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:43.970
than anywhere else in the world.

00:17:43.970 --> 00:17:46.750
That's 200 minutes a day.

00:17:46.750 --> 00:17:50.350
That's more than three hours
a day on their mobile device.

00:17:50.350 --> 00:17:54.080
That's pretty crazy,
and you'll notice it.

00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:56.330
[SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:18:01.350 --> 00:18:06.220
So still lots of policy
violations though.

00:18:06.220 --> 00:18:09.440
Dana just had her talk,
so this is good timing.

00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:11.950
IP infringement is very common.

00:18:11.950 --> 00:18:15.040
I spend a good part of my week
taking down apps and games that

00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:16.330
are IP infringement.

00:18:18.970 --> 00:18:22.080
Sexual content, also
very popular in the sense

00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:24.930
that they do it, and
then we block them.

00:18:24.930 --> 00:18:29.170
And then spam
installs [CHINESE].

00:18:29.170 --> 00:18:31.690
This will get you in a lot of
trouble with our policy team.

00:18:31.690 --> 00:18:33.070
We can track this.

00:18:33.070 --> 00:18:37.820
And then third party
payments, [CHINESE],

00:18:37.820 --> 00:18:39.790
still very popular in
Taiwan in the sense

00:18:39.790 --> 00:18:42.210
that people try to use
them on Google Play.

00:18:42.210 --> 00:18:45.470
But you know this is a
policy violation, as well.

00:18:45.470 --> 00:18:47.100
And then in terms of
marketing, there's

00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:48.780
a lot of offline marketing too.

00:18:51.460 --> 00:18:54.500
Every taxi is covered in a game.

00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:57.270
Every TV inside the
taxi has a game.

00:18:57.270 --> 00:19:01.070
Every bus has a game on it.

00:19:01.070 --> 00:19:04.240
Every subway station
has a game on it.

00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:07.870
Even the buildings
are covered in games.

00:19:07.870 --> 00:19:10.270
And then in turn of
non-games though, they're

00:19:10.270 --> 00:19:12.384
still very, very popular.

00:19:12.384 --> 00:19:13.800
The one that's
noticeably missing,

00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:17.700
I have social lifestyle
chat, news, music, and video.

00:19:17.700 --> 00:19:19.600
Commerce is starting
to change a lot now.

00:19:22.230 --> 00:19:28.890
All the big sites in
Taiwan, like PCHome, 17Life,

00:19:28.890 --> 00:19:30.740
[INAUDIBLE] Life, all
these kind of apps--

00:19:30.740 --> 00:19:34.614
they're all making very, very
strong material design apps.

00:19:34.614 --> 00:19:36.780
So you can do a lot of
browsing, because they shared

00:19:36.780 --> 00:19:39.640
with me that I think
something like over 40%

00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:43.400
of their interactions, they
all happen on mobile compared

00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:49.630
to web, whereas only a year ago
in Taiwan, people didn't use

00:19:49.630 --> 00:19:53.860
their phones as much; mostly
because 3G became much more

00:19:53.860 --> 00:19:56.570
widespread in the last year.

00:19:56.570 --> 00:19:58.910
In terms of payments, I
know this has been an issue.

00:19:58.910 --> 00:20:02.000
You guys asked Brahim about
it earlier this morning.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:03.940
Credit card's
still very popular.

00:20:03.940 --> 00:20:06.970
DCB launched in
May of this year.

00:20:06.970 --> 00:20:10.280
And we have people working
on that the gift cards,

00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:11.970
but we have to
understand that it's not

00:20:11.970 --> 00:20:16.480
as easy as just launching.

00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:20.420
LEON ZHAO: [CHINESE],
TPP, third party payment.

00:20:20.420 --> 00:20:24.830
[CHINESE], direct card billing.

00:20:24.830 --> 00:20:29.860
So you should know
TPP more DCB, right?

00:20:29.860 --> 00:20:34.910
[CHINESE], Google
Play presentation.

00:20:34.910 --> 00:20:36.690
Hong Kong?

00:20:36.690 --> 00:20:38.250
KEVIN: [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:20:44.170 --> 00:20:46.710
They're all games here.

00:20:46.710 --> 00:20:49.520
Interestingly enough,
"Supercell's" not in this

00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:50.530
chart either.

00:20:50.530 --> 00:20:54.537
Neither is "Machine Zone."
"Candy Crush" isn't even

00:20:54.537 --> 00:20:55.120
in this chart.

00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:58.060
So not a lot of Western
content in Hong Kong.

00:20:58.060 --> 00:21:00.540
As you can see, a lot of
Chinese content though.

00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:04.340
Same as Taiwan.

00:21:04.340 --> 00:21:06.440
Number one has always changed.

00:21:06.440 --> 00:21:07.510
There is no clear winner.

00:21:07.510 --> 00:21:09.610
In Taiwan, Hong
Kong, there isn't

00:21:09.610 --> 00:21:11.760
somebody that is so
powerful that they're always

00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:15.060
number one, whereas in the
other markets, it's like that.

00:21:15.060 --> 00:21:18.170
And I think because
Taiwan, Hong Kong are still

00:21:18.170 --> 00:21:22.110
emerging markets, we don't
have full payment covers yet.

00:21:22.110 --> 00:21:25.150
But it's coming quite quickly.

00:21:25.150 --> 00:21:29.160
Taiwan went from--
I think it grew 8x.

00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:32.530
[SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:21:35.970 --> 00:21:37.150
It's like a revenue.

00:21:37.150 --> 00:21:39.750
So it's pretty crazy.

00:21:39.750 --> 00:21:42.460
[SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:21:47.150 --> 00:21:49.150
LEON ZHAO: Because
you arrived at Taiwan.

00:21:49.150 --> 00:21:51.480
KEVIN: [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:57.230
But given that HK
is mostly urban,

00:21:57.230 --> 00:22:01.020
the average revenue per
paying user is very high.

00:22:01.020 --> 00:22:05.270
So when I say mostly
urban [CHINESE]

00:22:05.270 --> 00:22:06.410
It's a big city.

00:22:06.410 --> 00:22:08.030
There's not a lot of country.

00:22:08.030 --> 00:22:13.270
So almost everyone
has a mobile device.

00:22:13.270 --> 00:22:16.380
So in terms of non-game
messaging apps, all of them

00:22:16.380 --> 00:22:17.770
are very popular.

00:22:17.770 --> 00:22:21.690
It's not like Korea, Japan,
or Taiwan where one chat app,

00:22:21.690 --> 00:22:22.650
everybody uses.

00:22:22.650 --> 00:22:25.400
In Hong Kong, you see a
combination of all the chat

00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:30.800
apps that everybody uses,
as well as TV and streaming

00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:32.500
content is very, very popular.

00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:35.420
And we do have credit
cards, gift cards,

00:22:35.420 --> 00:22:36.970
and carrier billing.

00:22:36.970 --> 00:22:39.910
[SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:22:43.420 --> 00:22:45.830
LEON ZHAO: So we're going
to go to the panel session.

00:22:45.830 --> 00:22:48.830
But we don't have
a lot of time left.

00:22:48.830 --> 00:22:51.810
[SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:23:02.750 --> 00:23:07.440
So I'm going to skip this one.

00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:13.800
So you are the [? BD ?]
person locally,

00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:15.650
and you work with a
lot of the developers.

00:23:15.650 --> 00:23:19.480
And you help a lot
of them to go global.

00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:23.200
So what are some of the
best practices from them,

00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:25.570
with some specific
examples if you have,

00:23:25.570 --> 00:23:28.063
I can share with the
Chinese people over here?

00:23:28.063 --> 00:23:30.040
KOH KIM: Sure.

00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:33.860
So first impressions count.

00:23:33.860 --> 00:23:37.920
If you think about how your
user or potential customer

00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:40.400
player will get to
your application,

00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:43.270
eventually, they'll have to
go to the Google Play Store.

00:23:43.270 --> 00:23:46.540
And so really thinking
about your visual assets

00:23:46.540 --> 00:23:47.830
on the store listing.

00:23:47.830 --> 00:23:51.135
This includes creating a really
good icon that is actually

00:23:51.135 --> 00:23:52.790
a fit with that market.

00:23:52.790 --> 00:23:55.510
If you've noticed, the
icons in the United States

00:23:55.510 --> 00:23:58.630
and in Western Europe are
very different than in a lot

00:23:58.630 --> 00:24:00.440
of your Asian countries too.

00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:02.630
It's probably a lot
more female characters

00:24:02.630 --> 00:24:05.200
used in Asian markets
verses in the West.

00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:08.919
It's a lot more diverse mix
of characters, and genders,

00:24:08.919 --> 00:24:09.710
and all that stuff.

00:24:09.710 --> 00:24:12.420
But that's reflective
of the market in itself.

00:24:12.420 --> 00:24:14.360
So really thinking
about your icons,

00:24:14.360 --> 00:24:16.810
really thinking
about your titles.

00:24:16.810 --> 00:24:21.940
Also, video is a
big, big converter.

00:24:21.940 --> 00:24:26.300
Within the Western markets, a
lot of users, they watch video.

00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:28.120
YouTube is very popular.

00:24:28.120 --> 00:24:30.660
And so having a really
good game player trailer

00:24:30.660 --> 00:24:33.154
video is really important
when you're trying

00:24:33.154 --> 00:24:34.320
to attempt to get in the US.

00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:37.980
And then once you get people to
download and install your game,

00:24:37.980 --> 00:24:42.230
it's very important to have that
very good day one experience.

00:24:42.230 --> 00:24:44.490
If you've noticed,
games in Asia tend

00:24:44.490 --> 00:24:46.840
to be probably a little
bit more complicated game

00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:49.525
systems, and gameplay
mechanics, and a lot of mix

00:24:49.525 --> 00:24:52.150
of different gameplay mechanics
versus what you're going to see

00:24:52.150 --> 00:24:53.780
in a lot of Western markets.

00:24:53.780 --> 00:24:57.100
This is changing, but it's
very important to have

00:24:57.100 --> 00:24:59.860
what I call the first 10
minute gameplay, which

00:24:59.860 --> 00:25:02.430
is now, really the first
two minutes of game play

00:25:02.430 --> 00:25:04.500
is you want to make sure
you can get your users

00:25:04.500 --> 00:25:07.520
and your players into the game
and really understand what they

00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:11.380
need to do, and how
to get to the core

00:25:11.380 --> 00:25:14.120
gameplay mechanic really
quickly that's fun.

00:25:14.120 --> 00:25:16.720
And so the tutorial modes,
on boarding, this stuff

00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:19.260
is really, really important.

00:25:19.260 --> 00:25:22.070
That's what I probably think is
the biggest difference in terms

00:25:22.070 --> 00:25:23.612
of some of the
foreign games I see.

00:25:23.612 --> 00:25:25.653
Kevin and some of the
others will talk about some

00:25:25.653 --> 00:25:26.444
of the other stuff.

00:25:26.444 --> 00:25:28.800
But I think getting
that day one experience

00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:32.620
to be nearly flawless is very
important and really worth

00:25:32.620 --> 00:25:34.360
your time to think about.

00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:36.320
LEON ZHAO: [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:25:40.810 --> 00:25:44.600
So for Yoshi, so
actually currently,

00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:48.110
Japan is actually a
big market itself.

00:25:48.110 --> 00:25:49.720
But Japanese
developers are still

00:25:49.720 --> 00:25:52.690
trying to export games
to the global market.

00:25:52.690 --> 00:25:58.170
How did they do it, and what
are the things they did well?

00:25:58.170 --> 00:26:01.430
And you can share with
the audience here.

00:26:01.430 --> 00:26:07.370
YOSHI: So our two exported
from the Japan market,

00:26:07.370 --> 00:26:14.690
it's more like they're trying
to make good translations.

00:26:14.690 --> 00:26:18.700
Of course, import to Japans,
go to the Japan market also.

00:26:18.700 --> 00:26:22.930
They import to the good
quality translations.

00:26:22.930 --> 00:26:26.510
And also, they export
to their contents.

00:26:26.510 --> 00:26:30.020
Also, that they're thinking
the translation is important.

00:26:30.020 --> 00:26:32.830
And then they are changing
the screenshot, as well.

00:26:32.830 --> 00:26:37.870
So in the Japan market, a screen
shot is pretty noisy type.

00:26:37.870 --> 00:26:40.175
They're intentionally
making it noisy.

00:26:42.890 --> 00:26:49.620
like the anime stuff, and the
many game effects in there.

00:26:49.620 --> 00:26:52.130
But go to the Western
market, and they're trying

00:26:52.130 --> 00:26:56.280
to less noisy screenshots.

00:26:56.280 --> 00:27:00.010
That's your difference
from the Japanese market.

00:27:00.010 --> 00:27:02.200
And it depends on the market.

00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:04.480
So recently, the trend
of the Japanese market

00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:11.920
is in terms of the game, they're
putting the voiceover voice

00:27:11.920 --> 00:27:12.980
in the game.

00:27:12.980 --> 00:27:19.280
And then sometimes, there are
no translation in those markets,

00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:20.750
trying to make it
more like this is

00:27:20.750 --> 00:27:25.470
from Japan for popular
in the manga culture.

00:27:25.470 --> 00:27:28.910
And then sometimes, they're
changing their voice

00:27:28.910 --> 00:27:32.130
to translations,
especially foreign culture

00:27:32.130 --> 00:27:36.870
is totally different from the
Japanese culture actually.

00:27:36.870 --> 00:27:37.790
That's the things.

00:27:37.790 --> 00:27:41.043
LEON ZHAO: So what's
the difference in Korea?

00:27:41.043 --> 00:27:42.396
KH: What's the difference?

00:27:42.396 --> 00:27:44.620
YOSHI: I don't know.

00:27:44.620 --> 00:27:49.510
KH: I wanted to give
an example of Com2uS.

00:27:49.510 --> 00:27:53.540
So I talked with the
Com2us people a lot,

00:27:53.540 --> 00:27:58.720
and the main key
takeaway is they really

00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:01.510
try to understand users
in the local market.

00:28:01.510 --> 00:28:07.420
So when they exported
their titles in Taiwan,

00:28:07.420 --> 00:28:09.330
actually, the first
thing they did

00:28:09.330 --> 00:28:13.350
is to cultivate communities.

00:28:13.350 --> 00:28:17.310
So the weird thing, a lot of
hardcore games in Korea too.

00:28:17.310 --> 00:28:22.520
But the interesting thing
is the hardcore gamers,

00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:25.130
they want to belong
to some communities.

00:28:25.130 --> 00:28:27.340
So they want to talk
about the games.

00:28:27.340 --> 00:28:32.440
They want to talk about
some events of the games.

00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:36.310
They come to us really invested
in cultivating the communities

00:28:36.310 --> 00:28:37.990
for their games.

00:28:37.990 --> 00:28:41.600
And then the "Ace Fishing"
was the first title

00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:42.580
with communities.

00:28:42.580 --> 00:28:46.030
And with that, users
in the communities,

00:28:46.030 --> 00:28:49.750
they could find success for
some of those other titles.

00:28:49.750 --> 00:28:53.940
So understanding the local
users is very important.

00:28:53.940 --> 00:28:56.100
And then I can
say that for Korea

00:28:56.100 --> 00:29:02.260
too, as we are seeing a lot
of hardcore gamers emerging

00:29:02.260 --> 00:29:06.320
in Korea, you need to
think about engaging

00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:10.060
with the Korean hardcore
gamers in communities.

00:29:14.670 --> 00:29:17.115
KEVIN: [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:30:51.480 --> 00:30:53.740
LEON ZHAO: So first
impression matters.

00:30:53.740 --> 00:30:54.810
A screen shot matters.

00:30:54.810 --> 00:30:57.080
Community matters,
following the policy better.

00:31:00.180 --> 00:31:04.110
So maybe I'll just
ask one more question,

00:31:04.110 --> 00:31:07.470
and then we'll take
one live question.

00:31:07.470 --> 00:31:13.475
So what do you think
about your market in 2015?

00:31:13.475 --> 00:31:15.440
KOH KIM: What will
next year look like?

00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:16.962
LEON ZHAO: Yeah.

00:31:16.962 --> 00:31:18.251
KOH KIM: Hm.

00:31:18.251 --> 00:31:18.750
Hard to say.

00:31:18.750 --> 00:31:21.790
LEON ZHAO: That's a tough one.

00:31:21.790 --> 00:31:31.030
KEVIN: Taiwan, Hong
Kong, [CHINESE]

00:31:31.030 --> 00:31:36.780
2015, you'll notice
that a lot of people

00:31:36.780 --> 00:31:38.570
are looking at the same reports.

00:31:38.570 --> 00:31:39.570
They look at the report.

00:31:39.570 --> 00:31:42.280
They see how much Taiwan
and Hong Kong are growing.

00:31:42.280 --> 00:31:46.032
And as they get better
at going global,

00:31:46.032 --> 00:31:48.240
you're going to see a lot
more international content,

00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:51.700
especially as Google Play,
Brahim just talked about.

00:31:51.700 --> 00:31:54.500
As we increase payments
in Taiwan and Hong Kong,

00:31:54.500 --> 00:31:58.680
these regions are going
to grow a lot more.

00:31:58.680 --> 00:32:02.210
KOH KIM: I think there's
going to be a big rise of what

00:32:02.210 --> 00:32:04.620
I call game franchises.

00:32:04.620 --> 00:32:07.540
If you look in the console
and entertainment world, some

00:32:07.540 --> 00:32:12.680
of the biggest, I would say,
most popular types of content

00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:14.490
has always been brands.

00:32:14.490 --> 00:32:18.020
There's a reason why Disney,
there's a reason why Blizzard,

00:32:18.020 --> 00:32:19.830
there's a reason why
Activision and some

00:32:19.830 --> 00:32:21.650
of these other companies--
Activision and Blizzard's

00:32:21.650 --> 00:32:22.149
the same.

00:32:22.149 --> 00:32:24.740
But if you think
about it, they've

00:32:24.740 --> 00:32:28.410
somehow been able to create
these franchises of games

00:32:28.410 --> 00:32:31.110
and applications
that's basically

00:32:31.110 --> 00:32:33.710
been around for 10 plus years.

00:32:33.710 --> 00:32:37.130
And I think mobile gaming
is coming to the fact

00:32:37.130 --> 00:32:39.840
that where it's not really
going to be tied to the device.

00:32:39.840 --> 00:32:41.620
As we started out
earlier, Android

00:32:41.620 --> 00:32:43.770
is now becoming a
ubiquitous platform

00:32:43.770 --> 00:32:45.530
across multiple devices.

00:32:45.530 --> 00:32:48.090
We're moving towards a more
hardware agnostic world, which

00:32:48.090 --> 00:32:51.020
means a lot of this content
has become more immersive,

00:32:51.020 --> 00:32:53.240
and will likely come
outside the screen.

00:32:53.240 --> 00:32:55.770
And that's where brand is
really going to matter.

00:32:55.770 --> 00:32:57.730
So you probably have
seen, it's pretty easy

00:32:57.730 --> 00:33:01.540
to create any application
that is an Uber of something,

00:33:01.540 --> 00:33:05.650
or a Spotify for something, or
"Clash of Clans" of something,

00:33:05.650 --> 00:33:06.680
or [INAUDIBLE].

00:33:06.680 --> 00:33:08.230
So what's going
to really, really

00:33:08.230 --> 00:33:10.740
start setting people apart is
how they really, really think

00:33:10.740 --> 00:33:11.860
about their brand.

00:33:11.860 --> 00:33:13.430
What is the emotion?

00:33:13.430 --> 00:33:16.820
What do I want my
product to stand for when

00:33:16.820 --> 00:33:18.334
my users think of my product?

00:33:18.334 --> 00:33:19.750
And that's what I
think it's going

00:33:19.750 --> 00:33:20.958
to start happening next year.

00:33:20.958 --> 00:33:24.230
You're going to see a
lot more talk about what

00:33:24.230 --> 00:33:28.850
is that emotion that I want
to elicit from my user,

00:33:28.850 --> 00:33:33.590
rather than, how do I get a
user to convert to being a paid?

00:33:33.590 --> 00:33:35.350
KH: I totally agree
with branding.

00:33:35.350 --> 00:33:41.620
So in Korea, CJ, which is one
of the top developers in Korea,

00:33:41.620 --> 00:33:45.680
they already started branding.

00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:46.910
I totally agree with that.

00:33:46.910 --> 00:33:51.290
And then another thing
is that hardcore games,

00:33:51.290 --> 00:33:54.710
it will be huge for
next year for sure.

00:33:54.710 --> 00:33:56.610
But looking at
the casual titles,

00:33:56.610 --> 00:34:04.770
we already saw that there
were many non-gamers starting

00:34:04.770 --> 00:34:11.730
casual games after the
big boost of Kakao.

00:34:11.730 --> 00:34:15.560
And then we figured out, those
casual titles are quite old.

00:34:15.560 --> 00:34:20.110
So we might think that we can
see some new casual titles

00:34:20.110 --> 00:34:21.860
coming next year.

00:34:21.860 --> 00:34:25.739
So that'll be an interesting
point for next year in Korea.

00:34:28.270 --> 00:34:30.710
YOSHI: So we don't
have that much time.

00:34:30.710 --> 00:34:33.980
So in Japan, for the
games, probably we

00:34:33.980 --> 00:34:38.570
will see more real time much
player games, playing together

00:34:38.570 --> 00:34:40.199
with friends.

00:34:40.199 --> 00:34:42.219
And in terms of
the non-game side,

00:34:42.219 --> 00:34:46.280
we will see more tablet
and the material design,

00:34:46.280 --> 00:34:49.710
optimized applications
for application side

00:34:49.710 --> 00:34:52.120
in the Japan market.

00:34:52.120 --> 00:34:53.929
LEON ZHAO: Thanks everyone.

00:34:53.929 --> 00:34:57.200
So we're already
running out of time.

00:34:57.200 --> 00:35:00.810
But as promised, I'll
take one live question.

00:35:00.810 --> 00:35:03.070
[SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:35:23.410 --> 00:35:24.690
AUDIENCE: [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:35:50.140 --> 00:35:52.640
LEON ZHAO: How important is it
to implement material design

00:35:52.640 --> 00:35:53.140
games?

00:35:53.140 --> 00:35:54.140
Does it matter?

00:35:54.140 --> 00:35:56.050
Or do you see any games?

00:35:58.970 --> 00:36:00.620
YOSHI: I don't
think the material

00:36:00.620 --> 00:36:02.750
design is needed for the games.

00:36:02.750 --> 00:36:06.880
game has its own game
world in the game.

00:36:06.880 --> 00:36:12.510
So I think a more unique design
is needed in the game side.

00:36:15.737 --> 00:36:17.070
Co-op quality guideline as well.

00:36:19.780 --> 00:36:22.500
That's more like on
the application side.

00:36:22.500 --> 00:36:26.760
But policy is important for
games and their applications.

00:36:26.760 --> 00:36:27.615
No TPP.

00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:34.210
