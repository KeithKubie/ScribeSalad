00:00:08.113 --> 00:00:09.841
What makes a good horror story?

00:00:09.841 --> 00:00:12.162
Sure, you could throw 
in some hideous monsters,

00:00:12.162 --> 00:00:13.423
fountains of blood,

00:00:13.423 --> 00:00:15.372
and things jumping out from every corner,

00:00:15.372 --> 00:00:18.732
but as classic horror author
H.P. Lovecraft wrote,

00:00:18.732 --> 00:00:23.953
"The oldest and strongest
kind of fear is fear of the unknown."

00:00:23.953 --> 00:00:27.284
And writers harness that fear
not by revealing horrors,

00:00:27.284 --> 00:00:31.313
but by leaving the audience hanging
in anticipation of them.

00:00:31.313 --> 00:00:34.605
That is, in a state of suspense.

00:00:34.605 --> 00:00:39.342
The most familiar examples of suspense
come from horror films and mystery novels.

00:00:39.342 --> 00:00:41.251
What's inside the haunted mansion?

00:00:41.251 --> 00:00:43.993
Which of the dinner guests 
is the murderer?

00:00:43.993 --> 00:00:46.943
But suspense exists beyond these genres.

00:00:46.943 --> 00:00:48.714
Will the hero save the day?

00:00:48.714 --> 00:00:50.873
Will the couple get together
in the end?

00:00:50.873 --> 00:00:56.113
And what is the dark secret that causes
the main character so much pain?

00:00:56.113 --> 00:00:59.617
The key to suspense is that it sets up
a question, or several,

00:00:59.617 --> 00:01:02.157
that the audience hopes 
to get an answer to

00:01:02.157 --> 00:01:07.956
and delays that answer while maintaining
their interest and keeping them guessing.

00:01:07.956 --> 00:01:13.065
So what are some techniques you can use
to achieve this in your own writing?

00:01:13.065 --> 00:01:14.644
Limit the point of view.

00:01:14.644 --> 00:01:18.952
Instead of an omniscient narrator who can
see and relay everything that happens,

00:01:18.952 --> 00:01:22.515
tell the story from the perspective
of the characters.

00:01:22.515 --> 00:01:25.932
They may start off knowing just
as little as the audience does,

00:01:25.932 --> 00:01:28.608
and as they learn more, so do we.

00:01:28.608 --> 00:01:33.267
Classic novels, like "Dracula," for example,
are told through letters and diary entries

00:01:33.267 --> 00:01:35.468
where characters relate
what they've experienced

00:01:35.468 --> 00:01:38.361
and fear what's to come.

00:01:38.361 --> 00:01:41.237
Next, choose the right setting 
and imagery.

00:01:41.237 --> 00:01:46.806
Old mansions or castles with winding
halls and secret passageways

00:01:46.806 --> 00:01:50.836
suggest that disturbing things
are being concealed.

00:01:50.836 --> 00:01:56.278
Nighttime, fog, and storms all play
similar roles in limiting visibility

00:01:56.278 --> 00:01:59.128
and restricting characters' movements.

00:01:59.128 --> 00:02:03.030
That's why Victorian London is such
a popular setting.

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.866
And even ordinary places and objects
can be made sinister

00:02:06.866 --> 00:02:10.047
as in the Gothic novel "Rebecca"

00:02:10.047 --> 00:02:17.108
where the flowers at the protagonist's
new home are described as blood red.

00:02:17.108 --> 00:02:20.238
Three: play with style and form.

00:02:20.238 --> 00:02:24.358
You can build suspense by carefully
paying attention not just to what happens

00:02:24.358 --> 00:02:27.728
but how it's conveyed and paced.

00:02:27.728 --> 00:02:32.168
Edgar Allan Poe conveys the mental state
of the narrator in "The Tell-Tale Heart"

00:02:32.168 --> 00:02:35.959
with fragmented sentences
that break off suddenly.

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:38.508
And other short declarative sentences
in the story

00:02:38.508 --> 00:02:43.631
create a mix of breathless speed
and weighty pauses.

00:02:43.631 --> 00:02:46.400
On the screen, Alfred Hitchcock's
cinematography

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.639
is known for its use of extended
silences and shots of staircases

00:02:50.639 --> 00:02:53.699
to create a feeling of discomfort.

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:56.481
Four: use dramatic irony.

00:02:56.481 --> 00:02:59.430
You can't just keep the audience
in the dark forever.

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.827
Sometimes, suspense is best served

00:03:01.827 --> 00:03:08.310
by revealing key parts of the big secret
to the audience but not to the characters.

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.151
This is a technique known 
as dramatic irony,

00:03:11.151 --> 00:03:13.481
where the mystery becomes
not what will happen

00:03:13.481 --> 00:03:17.637
but when and how 
the characters will learn.

00:03:17.637 --> 00:03:19.741
In the classic play "Oedipus Rex,"

00:03:19.741 --> 00:03:23.591
the title character is unaware
that he has killed his own father

00:03:23.591 --> 00:03:25.461
and married his mother.

00:03:25.461 --> 00:03:29.520
But the audience knows, and watching
Oedipus gradually learn the truth

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:34.021
provides the story 
with its agonizing climax.

00:03:34.021 --> 00:03:36.095
And finally, the cliffhanger.

00:03:36.095 --> 00:03:38.003
Beware of overusing this one.

00:03:38.003 --> 00:03:43.483
Some consider it a cheap and easy trick,
but it's hard to deny its effectiveness.

00:03:43.483 --> 00:03:46.763
This is where a chapter, episode,
volume, or season

00:03:46.763 --> 00:03:50.862
cuts off right before something
crucial is revealed,

00:03:50.862 --> 00:03:55.234
or in the midst of a dangerous situation
with a slim chance of hope.

00:03:55.234 --> 00:03:57.532
The wait, whether moments or years,

00:03:57.532 --> 00:04:01.863
makes us imagine possibilities about
what could happen next,

00:04:01.863 --> 00:04:04.162
building extra suspense.

00:04:04.162 --> 00:04:06.753
The awful thing is almost always averted,

00:04:06.753 --> 00:04:10.049
creating a sense of closure 
and emotional release.

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:14.153
But that doesn't stop us from worrying
and wondering the next time

00:04:14.153 --> 00:04:17.107
the protagonists face 
near-certain disaster.
