00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:03.603
I'm honestly so happy right now.

00:00:03.636 --> 00:00:04.704
<i> - Me too.</i>

00:00:04.737 --> 00:00:06.406
- Hi!
Just kidding.

00:00:06.439 --> 00:00:09.676
- [laughing]

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:13.913 line:0%
- Hello, I'm Crissle West,
and today,

00:00:13.946 --> 00:00:17.817 line:0%
we're going to discuss
Marsha P. Johnson.

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.786 line:0%
<i> So, the story begins</i>

00:00:19.819 --> 00:00:22.789 line:0%
<i> in the middle of
 New York City,</i>

00:00:22.822 --> 00:00:25.725 line:0%
<i> in the Village,
 on Christopher Street,</i>

00:00:25.758 --> 00:00:27.493
<i> and back then, you know,</i>

00:00:27.526 --> 00:00:30.129
<i> New York had a growing
 LGBT population.</i>

00:00:30.162 --> 00:00:34.567
<i> So, basically,
 the non-straight population</i>

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.702
<i> had a bunch of bars and stuff</i>

00:00:36.735 --> 00:00:38.871
<i> in Greenwich Village,
 and so,</i>

00:00:38.904 --> 00:00:41.274
you know, all the queer kids
would go down

00:00:41.307 --> 00:00:42.208
to the Village and be like,

00:00:42.241 --> 00:00:45.244
<i> We're here to be ourselves.</i>

00:00:45.277 --> 00:00:48.114
But these people didn't have
a sense of community.

00:00:48.147 --> 00:00:50.049
<i> Like, this was a point in time</i>

00:00:50.082 --> 00:00:52.552
<i> where you came out
 as being trans,</i>

00:00:52.585 --> 00:00:54.153
<i> and you were just
 kicked out of the house.</i>

00:00:54.186 --> 00:00:55.354
<i> Like, and nobody gave
 a [bleep] about you.</i>

00:00:55.387 --> 00:00:57.523
<i> And that was kind of
 what happened to Marsha.</i>

00:00:57.556 --> 00:01:01.260
Like, she was a queer person
growing up in Jersey.

00:01:01.293 --> 00:01:04.597 line:0%
<i> Okay, so she would
 get on the train in Jersey,</i>

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:07.100 line:0%
<i> um, dressed as Malcolm,
 which was her birth name,</i>

00:01:07.133 --> 00:01:10.837 line:0%
<i> and then on the way over
 from Jersey to New York,</i>

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:11.904 line:0%
<i> transform into Marsha
 with, you know,</i>

00:01:11.937 --> 00:01:15.274 line:0%
<i> beer cans and pop cans,
 uh, for rollers.</i>

00:01:15.307 --> 00:01:17.877
<i> Just like,
 I'm Marsha P. Johnson, bitch,</i>

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:19.512
<i> and if you don't like it,
 you go to hell.</i>

00:01:19.545 --> 00:01:21.981
<i> Like, here I am, ho.
 What you gonna do?</i>

00:01:22.014 --> 00:01:24.183
<i> - Mm-hmm.</i>
- [laughing]

00:01:24.216 --> 00:01:26.085 align:start position:0%
- You have the best
laugh in the world.

00:01:26.118 --> 00:01:27.720
I love it.
<i> - Oh, God!</i>

00:01:27.753 --> 00:01:29.422
<i> Whoo! Anyways.</i>
- Yeah.

00:01:29.455 --> 00:01:32.125
- The 1960s is a very
tumultuous time

00:01:32.158 --> 00:01:34.861
for the United States
of America.

00:01:34.894 --> 00:01:37.797 line:0%
Because every minority group
imaginable

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:38.998 line:0%
<i> is tired of the status quo.</i>

00:01:39.031 --> 00:01:42.435 line:0%
<i> Okay, so there was a group
 of officers</i>

00:01:42.468 --> 00:01:45.471 line:0%
<i> in New York City
 called the Public Moral Squad,</i>

00:01:45.504 --> 00:01:47.273 line:0%
which is ridiculous,
because when in the [bleep]

00:01:47.306 --> 00:01:49.575
have morals been a part
of this God damn city?

00:01:49.608 --> 00:01:53.079
Like, the city's trash,
and the Public Moral Squad

00:01:53.112 --> 00:01:54.347
<i> took their orders
 directly from the mayor.</i>

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.749
<i> The mayor was like,
 I want you to go shut down</i>

00:01:56.782 --> 00:01:59.085
<i> the [bleep] gay bars.</i>

00:01:59.118 --> 00:02:01.154
<i> I'm sick of them mother[bleep]</i>

00:02:01.187 --> 00:02:03.156 line:0%
<i> putting they [bleep]
 on people's asses,</i>

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:06.159 line:0%
<i> and it's time to be over.</i>

00:02:08.194 --> 00:02:11.097 line:0%
<i> So, the night at Stonewall,
 June 18th--</i>

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:13.866 line:0%
<i> or 28th.
 June 28th.</i>

00:02:13.899 --> 00:02:15.501
I know it was one of the 8s.

00:02:15.534 --> 00:02:17.403
[laughter]

00:02:17.436 --> 00:02:18.671
Oh, God.

00:02:18.704 --> 00:02:21.874
<i> So, that night,</i>

00:02:21.907 --> 00:02:24.810
<i> Charles Smythe and
 Seymour Pine,</i>

00:02:24.843 --> 00:02:27.446
<i> they walked into the
 Stonewall Inn, and they said,</i>

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:28.714
<i> Hey, bitch!</i>

00:02:28.747 --> 00:02:30.983
<i> [clapping]
 We here!</i>

00:02:31.016 --> 00:02:33.252
<i> And [bleep] is under
 mother[bleep] arrest.</i>

00:02:33.285 --> 00:02:35.154
<i> Sit your gay ass down,</i>

00:02:35.187 --> 00:02:36.022
<i> and wait for us to</i>

00:02:36.055 --> 00:02:38.591
<i> verify your mother[bleep] I.D.</i>

00:02:38.624 --> 00:02:40.927
<i> with your [bleep]
 mother[bleep] genitals!</i>

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:42.061
<i> [crashing]</i>

00:02:42.094 --> 00:02:44.363
[laughing]

00:02:44.396 --> 00:02:45.398
Sorry, tree.

00:02:45.431 --> 00:02:46.566
[laughter]

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:47.867
<i> And the trans girls was like,
 Oh, no, bitch.</i>

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.136
<i> We didn't ask for this.</i>

00:02:50.169 --> 00:02:51.504
<i> And some people were, like,
 freaking out,</i>

00:02:51.537 --> 00:02:53.172
<i> and trying to, like,
 go for the exits,</i>

00:02:53.205 --> 00:02:55.908
<i> but the police had barricaded
 the whole thing.</i>

00:02:55.941 --> 00:02:57.810
<i> And Marsha says,
 You know what?</i>

00:02:57.843 --> 00:03:01.781
Today is not
the mother[bleep] day!

00:03:01.814 --> 00:03:04.150
<i> Today is the day that I say no
 to this bull[bleep].</i>

00:03:04.183 --> 00:03:07.887
<i> Like, y'all are not going
 to continue</i>

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.423
<i> to run us, to dictate</i>

00:03:10.456 --> 00:03:12.058
<i> what our lives should be like.</i>

00:03:12.091 --> 00:03:15.228
T-t-to dish--to dic-trate

00:03:15.261 --> 00:03:17.263
<i> what our lives
 are supposed to be like.</i>

00:03:17.296 --> 00:03:20.433
<i> You're not in charge
 any [bleep] more.</i>

00:03:20.466 --> 00:03:23.803
<i> We're here, and as long as we
 have to pay taxes,</i>

00:03:23.836 --> 00:03:25.137
<i> you're gonna have to listen to
 what the [bleep]</i>

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:27.640
<i> that we have to shay--
 we have to sh--</i>

00:03:27.673 --> 00:03:28.641
<i> to shay.</i>

00:03:28.674 --> 00:03:30.309
<i> To say!</i>

00:03:30.342 --> 00:03:33.546
So Marsha P. Johnson
stood the [bleep] up,

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:35.982
<i> and she picked up
 a shot glass,</i>

00:03:36.015 --> 00:03:38.050
<i> and she smashed that [bleep]
 against the mirror and said,</i>

00:03:38.083 --> 00:03:40.553
<i> I got my civil rights!</i>

00:03:40.586 --> 00:03:43.823
She had had enough that
mother[bleep] day.

00:03:43.856 --> 00:03:46.892
<i> So, during the Stonewall riots,
 that first night,</i>

00:03:46.925 --> 00:03:48.794
all these members
of the gay community

00:03:48.827 --> 00:03:50.363
started gathering outside.

00:03:50.396 --> 00:03:52.031
<i> Marsha, she's thinking, like,
 Oh, my God.</i>

00:03:52.064 --> 00:03:53.199
<i> There's so many of, like, us.</i>

00:03:53.232 --> 00:03:56.068
<i> There's 500 of this--</i>

00:03:56.101 --> 00:03:57.503
<i> of us.</i>

00:03:57.536 --> 00:03:59.605
By the time backup showed up
to Christopher Street,

00:03:59.638 --> 00:04:00.806
it was way too late.

00:04:00.839 --> 00:04:02.475
<i> Some of the rioters
 threw rocks and [bleep].</i>

00:04:02.508 --> 00:04:04.477
<i> Others found bricks and
 [bleep], and they're like,</i>

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:07.247
<i> We're gonna [bleep] it up
 by any means necessary.</i>

00:04:08.247 --> 00:04:10.983
- [laughing]

00:04:11.016 --> 00:04:12.652
Oh, God.
- It was good.

00:04:12.685 --> 00:04:15.454
- I told myself I was not
gonna get drunk this time.

00:04:15.487 --> 00:04:16.422
I don't know how I thought
that was gonna work.

00:04:16.455 --> 00:04:18.257
[laughter]

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:19.258
Okay.

00:04:19.291 --> 00:04:21.694
So, the people
at Stonewall that night

00:04:21.727 --> 00:04:23.963
realized there's
a community of us.

00:04:23.996 --> 00:04:27.066
<i> It's not just 20 of us
 on [bleep] Wednesday night</i>

00:04:27.099 --> 00:04:28.968
<i> when it's half off--
 there's a whole group of us</i>

00:04:29.001 --> 00:04:31.337
<i> who are here
 in this gay [bleep]</i>

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:32.538
<i> and you're not
 going to erase us</i>

00:04:32.571 --> 00:04:35.941
<i> from the mother[bleep]
 conversation no more.</i>

00:04:35.974 --> 00:04:37.677
<i> So, Marsha says, Ultimately,</i>

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:39.845
<i> humanness wins.
 - Yes.</i>

00:04:39.878 --> 00:04:43.316
<i> - Ultimately, people win.
 - Yeah.</i>

00:04:43.349 --> 00:04:45.217
- That night,
and then the next one,

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:47.086
constitute the Stonewall Riots,

00:04:47.119 --> 00:04:49.789
and that is what got the whole

00:04:49.822 --> 00:04:51.424
<i> gay rights movement in America</i>

00:04:51.457 --> 00:04:54.160
<i> started off.</i>

00:04:54.193 --> 00:04:55.628
<i> - Like, that gives me chills.</i>

00:04:55.661 --> 00:04:58.798
<i> - It's the shot glass heard
 around the world.</i>

00:04:58.831 --> 00:05:00.900 line:0%
<i> A few weeks later,</i>

00:05:00.933 --> 00:05:03.135 line:0%
<i> Marsha and her friend Sylvia</i>

00:05:03.168 --> 00:05:05.171
<i> formed the Street Transvestite</i>

00:05:05.204 --> 00:05:07.273
<i> Act--Reaction Evolution.</i>

00:05:07.306 --> 00:05:09.942
<i> Which is not words we--
 we would use to gay--</i>

00:05:09.975 --> 00:05:11.911
today, obviously,
it would be more like,

00:05:11.944 --> 00:05:13.746
Street Trans-vendor.

00:05:13.779 --> 00:05:15.281
Transgender, I mean.

00:05:15.314 --> 00:05:17.717
Not trans-vinegar, yeah, it's
not like that [bleep].

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:20.586
<i> Basically, Marsha and Sylvia</i>

00:05:20.619 --> 00:05:21.921
<i> were out there in the '60s</i>

00:05:21.954 --> 00:05:23.723
<i> and '70s just trying to get</i>

00:05:23.756 --> 00:05:25.691
<i> these trans kids
 a place to live.</i>

00:05:25.724 --> 00:05:27.593
She really was a badass.
- Yeah.

00:05:27.626 --> 00:05:29.662 align:end position:100%
- And so brave--like, I would
not have been that brave.

00:05:29.695 --> 00:05:31.030 align:start size:66% position:34%
In the '60s and '70s?

00:05:31.063 --> 00:05:32.832 align:end position:100%
I mean, it was bad enough
being black.

00:05:32.865 --> 00:05:34.066
- Right.
- But add in a queer identity,

00:05:34.099 --> 00:05:37.269 align:end position:100%
and then a--a queer gender
identity too?

00:05:37.302 --> 00:05:39.538 align:start size:41% position:59%
It was a lot.
It was a lot.

00:05:39.571 --> 00:05:40.306 align:start size:72% position:28%
And she still faced it.

00:05:40.339 --> 00:05:43.542 align:start size:31% position:69%
But truly?

00:05:43.575 --> 00:05:44.910 align:end position:100%
Black people deserve to be
on all this [bleep].

00:05:44.943 --> 00:05:46.879
- Mm-hmm.
- Black people and Sacagawea.

00:05:46.912 --> 00:05:49.648 align:end position:100%
Who needs to get off
the God damn coin

00:05:49.681 --> 00:05:51.417 align:end position:100%
and onto some [bleep]
paper money.

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:53.119
[laughter]

00:05:53.152 --> 00:05:55.285
Because this our [bleep].
- Yeah.
