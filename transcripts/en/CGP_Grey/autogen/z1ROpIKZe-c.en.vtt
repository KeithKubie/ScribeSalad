00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:05.890
 "City of London" has a unique location, it is a city within a city in a state within a state 

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:09.760
 By holding the most complex elections to elect a government, which includes 

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:14.900
 Medieval guilds, modern companies, luxury titles and hats. All are related 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:18.500
 Some are in a very complex sketch, but why this complexity? 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:22.690
 Although modern skyscrapers may make you think the city is relatively modern, 

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:26.530
 But it is the oldest government on the island of Great Britain and continues. 

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:31.240
 The "City of London" preceded the empire ruled by Victoria and the kingdoms that Anne united 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:34.150
 And the Magna Carta document signed by John. 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:38.470
 London, which surrounds the city, elected its first mayor in 2000 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:43.460
 The list of mayors who managed the city of London is about 700 people 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:45.730
 More than a thousand years ago. 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:50.630
 The Government of "City of London" is so old that there are no documents to indicate 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:54.890
 Found, there are documents such as the Magna Carta that I mentioned earlier, which remember the powers 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.050
 "City of London" existed by then. 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:02.880
 While a government such as the United States Government derives its power from the people, 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:06.960
 The parliament derives its power from the royal crown, (which derives its power from the Lord) 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:13.960
 "The city of London: derives its strength from its" long life "in the sense that the city is very old. 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:19.100
 This age brings strange and unconventional habits, most notably these habits, 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.960
 That in the "City of London" elections, companies can vote. 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.600
 Really a lot! About 3/4 votes are cast by companies 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.780
 While the remaining quarter of the population. The way this election works is that all that the company has grown up 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.140
 All that came to the voices of more than the "City of London." Then the companies give their votes 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:41.170
 For a selection of staff who work but do not live in the city 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:43.810
 These officers are already voting on the date of the election. 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:47.570
 The result is that the elected council, with its bureaucracy beating the heart 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:52.070
 "City of London", containing approximately 20 members elected by the population for 80 members 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:53.640
 Elected by city companies. 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.180
 The reason behind this unconventional tradition is that it is for everyone living in 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:04.790
 "City of London," 43 people arrive daily. With a total of 300,000 expatriates using 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:09.220
 City services and their employment depend on the fact that "City of London" has a business environment. 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:13.550
 The man who heads the elected council and is at the head of the city government is 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:15.890
 "Lord the Honorable Mayor of London". 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.360
 Now, suppose you "you" want to be Lord Mayor 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.750
 Sure as in other London all you need is 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.890
 (A) be a British national, a Commonwealth or a European citizen; 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:27.110
 B) lived in the city for a year, which is who 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:28.640
 C) won the elections 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:34.440
 Right? Certainly not, in the City of London this is not enough at all. Is ready 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:35.250
 For a list of requirements? 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:39.720
 Before entering the race for the post of Lord Mayor must be sheriff "City of London" "Chief of Police". 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.970
 But before you are sheriff of the city, you need to be a member of the local council. 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:48.690
 What is a member of the local council? Well, "City of London" is segmented into 25 parts, and each part is elected 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:53.450
 One member of the local council to represent them in the local council, which is part of 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:54.200
 Popular Council. 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.200
 Before you can compete for local council membership you need to get the title of Freedom City. It is able to give you, 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:03.280
 Freedom City title? Not a member of the local council you are trying to enter 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.910
 mechanism. 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:08.830
 Which may be seen as a conflict of interest. Fortunately there is another way to get the title of Freedom City 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:13.680
 He joined a union, unfortunately not called unions, but called them 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.930
 Cooperative companies (the name is boring and less descriptive), but it remains 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:23.050
 Unions of the Middle Ages, many of which are still within the city, there are about 108 of them to choose 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:24.820
 Examples include: 

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:25.500
 Pharmacists 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:26.190
 Fish vendors 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.690
 Freemasons 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:27.180
 Textile suppliers 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:28.480
 Scientific Equipment Manufacturers 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:28.950
 The bankers 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:29.500
 Carpenters 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:30.020
 Tire makers 

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.530
 The butchers 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.860
 Bakers 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:32.410
 Two different groups of candlestick makers 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:35.950
 And most exciting: legal accountants! 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:39.400
 Many of these unions, such as darts, have become charitable unions, but some are still 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.480
 Effective, such as gold workers who inspect the British currency and the Vauxhall vehicles 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.120
 The horses who licensed as taxi drivers. 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:49.210
 To join one of these unions you will need either to meet the professional requirements, 

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:53.940
 Or charity such as clothing vendors will need the approval of two current members, 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:54.510
 Others will not tell you how to get membership. 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:57.290
 If you do not have any membership requirements, you think you are 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:01.730
 You may come and start your "special" union to guarantee yourself the title of freedom of the city, 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:06.040
 Will face a great deal of success because the new unions need to agree, as I expected, 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:06.980
 Local Council. 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:11.150
 But suppose you've guaranteed the title of Freedom City one way or another, now 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:15.670
 You can enter the race on the membership seat for one penalty - after the approval of an adviser 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:17.400
 Advisory Committee. 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:21.190
 But, that's a simple hindrance. You can win a seat in the local council in one 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:25.430
 4 parts in which the population lives or in one of 21 parts where the headquarters of the companies. 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:29.210
 When you become a member of the local council you can now complete your way to become mayor in the municipal building, 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:33.220
 You must now elect a city sheriff, but now members of cooperative companies 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:34.500
 Who chooses Sharif. 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:38.290
 So "if" you choose the members of the cooperative companies as honorable, after successfully completing your legal period 

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:41.590
 "Now" can enter the race on the mayor's platform. 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:45.560
 But, to the surprise, the people of "City of London" do not vote for the mayor, 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:47.840
 It is our old friends in the local council who do it. 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:52.010
 In short, when you get the title of freedom of the city either from the local council 

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:55.760
 Or cooperative companies and after you are elected as a member of one of the parts of the city in the local council and promised to choose cooperative companies 

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:59.840
 For the post of sheriff and after you complete the legal period and at the same time I am still a member of 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:02.750
 Local Council You can compete for the post of mayor. 

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:07.250
 Assuming that other members of the local council are senior in your choice, you can finally become 

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:13.510
 "Lord the Honorable Mayor of London", for one year only, and without salary. As you should 

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:17.760
 Cover your expenses yourself, which will be huge because your new business includes 

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:22.180
 You have delivered hundreds of speeches throughout the year and marketed the city around the world. 

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:25.960
 But you will be able to get that luxury hat, which makes it worth the suffering.
