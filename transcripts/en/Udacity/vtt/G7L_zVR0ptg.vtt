00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.610
Another refinement of associa, of associations that I mentioned, is qualifiers.

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:10.760
Qualifiers are indicated by small rectangles, that are on the sides or

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:16.090
edges of class rectangles. The small rectangles contain the name of

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:21.740
one of the attributes, of that particular class. The attribute within the small

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:28.290
rectangle is the qualifier, that can provide access to, instances

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:33.430
of that particular class. If you were doing a relational database model you

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:39.246
would think of the qualifier as the key, into the set of the instances.

00:00:39.246 --> 00:00:45.130
In the leftmost example here, we have bank,

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:50.690
and the account number is the qualifier. Note also that there's some

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:56.600
multiplicity information, that a person can have any number of bank accounts,

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:02.950
for example. On the right, we have the situation with a chessboard and

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:07.370
its squares. How would we identify a particular square? In this case,

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:12.180
we're going to use a pair of attributes, giving the rank and the file of

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.070
the particular squares within the chessboard. Notice also that in the chessboard

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:22.920
situation, we have a, a composition. Notice the filled black diamond.
