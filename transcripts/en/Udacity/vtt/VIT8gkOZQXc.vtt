00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.670
We now know how pipelines work and how they need to balance the increasing clock

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:10.410
frequency versus the stalls and flushes caused by hazards. Nowadays almost every

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.110
processor uses pipelining. So, we will use

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.239
our pipelining knowledge over and over as

00:00:16.239 --> 00:00:20.100
we look at some of the more advanced topics in the next few lessons.
