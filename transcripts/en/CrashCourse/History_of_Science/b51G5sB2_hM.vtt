00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:11.570
The development of ecology revealed a deeply
connected world: we all inhabit one big biosphere—one

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:12.830
big house.

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:14.780
We share one hydrosphere, one atmosphere…

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:15.950
You get the idea.

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:20.400
But the flip side of finding this connection
was learning about various kinds of environmental

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.789
collapse, already in motion.

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:25.070
We share one fragile house.

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:29.820
We’ve said that sciences generally move
from understanding natural phenomena to controlling

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:30.820
them.

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:36.180
Today, we’ll examine scientific efforts
to control the whole world, AKA capital-N

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.580
Nature.

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:43.630
Some have saved lives—but there are also
downsides, frequently devastating.

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:50.920
[Intro Music Plays]

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:55.070
During the Cold War, attempts to control Nature
by technological means involved both Soviet

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:57.050
and American plans for weather control

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:01.800
—in part because each side worried that
the other would figure it out first.

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.600
Spoiler Alert: neither did.

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.830
The U.S. conducted one secret rainmaking project,
Operation Popeye, during the Vietnam War.

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:13.969
They ineffectively tried to make the monsoon
season last longer in Southeast Asia, hampering

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:18.460
the North Vietnamese army’s movements by
deteriorating roads and bridges through flooding.

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:20.749
That’s James Bond villain stuff!

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:26.470
The U.S. also carried out an operation at
home called Project Stormfury from 1962 to

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:28.740
1983,

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.579
seeding dangerous tropical storms with silver
iodide in order to freeze some of the water

00:01:33.579 --> 00:01:37.210
in them and slow them down, making them less
dangerous.

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:42.840
This didn’t work well in practice, but the
experimental flights were valuable to meteorology.

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.380
Other grand-scale engineering projects focused
on power and agriculture.

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:52.460
These included many irrigation canals and
gigantic dams, like the Aswan High Dam in

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.539
Egypt, built between 1960 and 1970.

00:01:55.539 --> 00:02:00.420
These projects allowed people in dry regions
or ones subject to seasonal flooding to have

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.939
more control over when they planted, and to
grow more harvests per year.

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:09.940
In the United States, the Reclamation Service,
later the Bureau of Reclamation, worked starting

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:13.010
in 1902 to irrigate the Western plains.

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:17.220
Today, that Bureau is the largest wholesaler
of water in the U.S.

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:23.040
Overall, across industrial societies, agriculture
changed a lot as engineers developed machines

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.260
like tractors,

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:29.600
chemists created new fertilizers and pesticides,
and plant geneticists bred hybrid seeds.

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.849
Plants need the nutrient nitrogen to grow.

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:37.409
But plants can’t “fix” their own nitrogen
from air, so they need bacteria, or human-made

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:40.069
fertilizers like ammonia, to do it for them.

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:45.430
And in the early 1900s, German chemists Fritz
Haber and Carl Bosch developed a way to take

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.849
nitrogen right from the air!

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:49.349
This seemed like a big win.

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:54.290
Any industrial society could use the Haber–Bosch
process for synthetic nitrogen fixation to

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.780
make millions of tons of fertilizer and grow
more crops.

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:02.730
And synthetic ammonia from the process was
also used to make nitric acid, which was necessary

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.220
to make explosives.

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:07.780
So again, war and professional science were
tightly linked.

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.439
But the bigger problems, long term, were environmental.

00:03:11.439 --> 00:03:16.820
The Haber–Bosch process requires fossil
fuels like oil or natural gas to work.

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:21.219
Which seemed fine: industrialists didn’t
know that burning these fuels would disrupt

00:03:21.219 --> 00:03:22.370
the earth’s climate cycles.

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:27.330
A more obvious problem is runoff: to make
plants take up lots of nitrogen, industrial

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:30.939
farming treats them with more fertilizer than
they need.

00:03:30.939 --> 00:03:37.000
Rain washes the leftover fertilizer into waterways,
leading to eutrophication, or too many nutrients

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.000
in the water.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.390
This leads to a build-up of algae, which use
up the oxygen in the water, making it deadly

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:43.390
for fish.

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:48.030
Another seemingly big win with unintended
consequences was an improvement in staple

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:49.030
crops.

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:55.530
In the 1930s, after decades of research, agricultural
scientists in the U.S. rolled out hybrid crop

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:56.530
varieties.

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:00.200
These crosses of “pure” strains produced
much higher yields.

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:03.689
But farmers started using only these seeds.

00:04:03.689 --> 00:04:07.170
Commercial fields became monoculture, or “one-plant.”

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:10.310
This means fewer plants are commercially available
today.

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:13.129
And pests can more easily wipe out any one
plant.

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:17.970
This is the opposite of growing many plants
together, or polyculture, which can help restore

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:20.610
nutrients to soil without synthetic chemicals.

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:25.050
So on the one hand, synthetic fertilizers
and hybrid crops seemed like easy wins.

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:29.449
On the other hand, there were negative long-term
consequences.

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:34.789
On the, uh, third hand, even these advancements
didn’t prevent environmental problems and

00:04:34.789 --> 00:04:39.440
growing fears that agricultural innovation
just couldn’t keep up with rapid population

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:40.440
growth.

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:45.009
For example, part of the U.S. experienced
severe droughts in the 1930s and was farmed

00:04:45.009 --> 00:04:46.800
in unsustainable ways.

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:51.700
This led to massive dust storms, collectively
called the Dust Bowl, which forced many farmers

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:54.600
to abandon their farms—during the Great
Depression.

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.590
And this was the United States!

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:59.460
Most of the world’s farmers remained smallholders:

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:05.470
they worked plots of land smaller than ten
hectares, largely without industrial machines.

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:09.620
Populations were growing, but storms and wars
threatened to lead to famines.

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:14.860
So many scientists, taking a note from that
crotchety preacher who inspired Darwin, Thomas

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:18.240
Malthus, wrote pessimistically about humanity’s
future.

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:23.630
Probably the most famous of these “neo-Malthusian”
thinkers was American biologist Paul Ehrlich,

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:29.660
whose 1968 bestseller, The Population Bomb,
predicted that famines would soon kill millions

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:32.160
of people, especially in India.

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:33.639
Which didn’t happen…

00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:38.160
Arguably the biggest example of humans controlling
our environment was the Green Revolution in

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:39.530
the 1950s and 60s,

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:44.070
when crop yields went up for farmers in less
industrialized countries—way up.

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:50.340
In one sense, it’s a simple story of science,
applied: scientists from rich countries offered

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:52.870
new techniques built on hybrid seeds.

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:56.560
In another sense, it’s science in the service
of politics.

00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:01.210
This revolution was organized by International
Agricultural Research Centers,

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:07.310
or IARCs, which were funded by federal grants
from developed and developing countries, and

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:10.180
by private foundations like Rockefeller and
Ford.

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:15.860
The IARCs believed that the best way to improve
yields was through smart breeding.

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:20.039
They wanted to focus on breeding plants resistant
to pests in specific areas.

00:06:20.039 --> 00:06:25.199
And simultaneously, to make these plants take
up more nitrogen and grow more edible material.

00:06:25.199 --> 00:06:29.970
Lots of people were involved in this work,
particularly in the U.S., Mexico, and India.

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:31.539
But people love heroes!

00:06:31.539 --> 00:06:36.700
So Green Revolution stories often focus on
American agronomist and plant geneticist Norman

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:41.690
Borlaug—who was, to be fair, an awesome
scientist.

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:42.690
Introduce us, ThoughtBubble.

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:46.590
Borlaug joined the Rockefeller Foundation’s
group in Mexico in 1944.

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:50.830
He had never worked on wheat, maize, or beans
before.

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:52.900
Aaand he didn’t speak Spanish.

00:06:52.900 --> 00:07:00.659
But, he eventually learned it and stayed ins
He developed a hybrid wheat that withstands

00:07:00.659 --> 00:07:03.009
a common fungus called rust blight.

00:07:03.009 --> 00:07:04.009
How?

00:07:04.009 --> 00:07:09.129
Lots of painstaking research into plant genetics,
courtesy other geneticists, and lots of field

00:07:09.129 --> 00:07:10.129
trials:

00:07:10.129 --> 00:07:14.949
Borlaug took Norin 10—a wheat bred by Japanese
scientist Gonjiro Inazuka

00:07:14.949 --> 00:07:19.750
that was short but produced lots of food,
if given lots of nitrogen and defended with

00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:21.370
chemical pesticides—

00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:24.940
and bred a semi-dwarf wheat specifically for
Mexican climates.

00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:29.620
Starting around 1950, Mexican agriculture
shifted toward high-yielding varieties of

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:32.610
wheat, synthetic nitrogen, and pesticides.

00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:36.560
And this revolution in farming soon spread
to Colombia, Chile, and India.

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:40.509
The Ford Foundation pushed the Indian government
to adopt the same changes.

00:07:40.509 --> 00:07:45.680
So Indian scientists worked with Mexican scientists,
and hybrid semi-dwarf Mexican wheat seeds

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:49.830
were shipped to India in time for the 1963
planting season.

00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:52.800
This lead to astounding growths in yield.

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:57.169
Also in the 1960s, an international team of
scientists and farmers worked to develop a

00:07:57.169 --> 00:08:01.750
new variety of high-yielding semi-dwarf rice
called IR8—

00:08:01.750 --> 00:08:03.569
sometimes called “miracle rice.”

00:08:03.569 --> 00:08:08.800
In 1971, the Rockefeller and Ford Foundations
created the Consultative Group on International

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:13.229
Agricultural Research to further extend the
IARC research.

00:08:13.229 --> 00:08:15.580
Borlaug won the Nobel in 1970.

00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:20.819
Buuut… no Mexican, Indian, or Japanese scientists
shared the prize.

00:08:20.819 --> 00:08:21.830
Thanks, ThoughtBubble.

00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:26.740
Meanwhile, with minimal support from the Soviet
Union, the Maoist Chinese state fostered its

00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:28.069
own scientific farming

00:08:28.069 --> 00:08:34.440
—including a system of experimental agricultural
stations and hybrid sorghum and hybrid rice

00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:35.440
varieties.

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:38.760
Agriculturally, the Green Revolution was an
immediate success.

00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:42.229
Thousands of tons of seeds moved from Mexico
to India.

00:08:42.229 --> 00:08:43.440
Food prices dropped.

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:47.149
India became a rice exporter and currently
overproduces wheat.

00:08:47.149 --> 00:08:52.290
But in the longer-term, the Green Revolution
meant that way more farmers started practicing

00:08:52.290 --> 00:08:57.270
monoculture, essentially betting their chips
on a small number of hybrid crops.

00:08:57.270 --> 00:09:00.519
Thousands of traditional varieties are no
longer cultivated.

00:09:00.519 --> 00:09:06.269
Only four crops—wheat, maize, rice, and
soy—provide more than half of our food today.

00:09:06.269 --> 00:09:10.950
Socially, industrial farming requires investing
in expensive equipment and hybrid seeds,

00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:13.970
which aren’t produced by the previous year’s
harvest.

00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:16.339
This changed the business cycles of farmers.

00:09:16.339 --> 00:09:21.300
Zooming out, the Green Revolution changed
what defines a “modern” society:

00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:27.370
it now meant using synthetic nitrogen, pesticides,
and tractors on large monoculture farms.

00:09:27.370 --> 00:09:31.769
The idea of the Revolution had been to end
hunger, and it probably prevented millions

00:09:31.769 --> 00:09:32.779
from starvation.

00:09:32.779 --> 00:09:36.080
But famine has always been linked to distribution,
or the political

00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:40.940
-economic process of moving food around, not
only how much food is produced.

00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:45.700
And the Green Revolution was also always about
the United States flexing its scientific muscle

00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:46.970
around the world,

00:09:46.970 --> 00:09:51.750
buying allies with bread—including India,
the world’s largest democracy.

00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:53.570
AKA soft power!

00:09:53.570 --> 00:09:58.380
Meanwhile, also in the 1950s and 60s, synthetic
pesticides were used to control bugs that

00:09:58.380 --> 00:10:00.110
spread human illnesses.

00:10:00.110 --> 00:10:06.620
The most famous was dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane—DDT

00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:10.930
—
that was sprayed on fields, urban green spaces,

00:10:10.930 --> 00:10:12.720
right on little kids—pretty much everywhere.

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:18.209
It had seemingly miraculously dropped mosquito
populations during World War II, helping fight

00:10:18.209 --> 00:10:20.880
the spread of malaria and typhus.

00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:25.910
Only it turned out that DDT, while not immediately
toxic to humans, was toxic to lots of other

00:10:25.910 --> 00:10:28.670
living things, like birds and fish.

00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:31.399
And it wasn’t good for humans in the long-run,
either.

00:10:31.399 --> 00:10:34.850
After years of careful research—all of which
angered scientists working for the chemical

00:10:34.850 --> 00:10:35.850
industry

00:10:35.850 --> 00:10:40.850
—American biologist and pioneering environmentalist
Rachel Carson wrote a series of articles that

00:10:40.850 --> 00:10:44.220
became the book Silent Spring in 1962.

00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:49.600
She explained in simple, beautiful language
how some kinds of synthetic pesticides work,

00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:51.860
and why they are often a terrible idea.

00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:56.399
With this book, along with her other books,
numerous op-eds, and appearances, Carson helped

00:10:56.399 --> 00:10:59.680
spark the modern environmentalism movement
in the United States.

00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:04.880
In addition to long-term effects, pesticides
have also been involved in acute disasters.

00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:11.370
In 1984, a Union Carbide India chemical plant
in the city of Bhopal had a serious accident.

00:11:11.370 --> 00:11:15.329
This plant produced the insecticide Sevin,
using a highly toxic chemical called methyl

00:11:15.329 --> 00:11:16.760
isocyanate gas.

00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:19.980
The accident released thirty two tons of methyl
isocyanate…

00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:22.510
Half a million people were exposed.

00:11:22.510 --> 00:11:26.690
Four thousand people died immediately; twenty
five hundred died that year.

00:11:26.690 --> 00:11:31.110
Bhopal is widely regarded as the worst industrial
disaster in history

00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:35.950
Only two years later, in 1986, a nuclear reactor
in Chernobyl melted down.

00:11:35.950 --> 00:11:40.220
Clouds of radioactive material billowed across
Europe, and then the world.

00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:44.470
Conflicting, politically inflected epidemiological
studies put the long-term casualties from

00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:45.579
cancer due to Chernobyl

00:11:45.579 --> 00:11:49.279
at anywhere between ten thousand and hundreds
of thousands.

00:11:49.279 --> 00:11:52.779
So… controlling nature has not been a slam-dunk
for humankind.

00:11:52.779 --> 00:11:56.850
And most of “humankind” had no say in
these projects!

00:11:56.850 --> 00:12:00.130
The effects, good or bad, just happened to
them.

00:12:00.130 --> 00:12:02.280
And this is still the case.

00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:06.340
In fact, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change warns that global food supplies are

00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:07.340
in danger,

00:12:07.340 --> 00:12:12.010
because staple crops like rice, wheat, and
corn are now facing a slowdown in the rate

00:12:12.010 --> 00:12:13.440
at which their yields go up.

00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:19.350
Meaning, back to Malthus, we might soon have
more hungry mouths than food, even if agronomists

00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:21.210
keep making incremental gains.

00:12:21.210 --> 00:12:26.250
So some serious scientists are returning to
the idea of controlling the climate!

00:12:26.250 --> 00:12:32.880
In 2006, Nobel-winning atmospheric scientist
Paul Crutzen called for humanity to use geoengineering,

00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:36.950
the modification of the climate, to keep our
world habitable.

00:12:36.950 --> 00:12:40.870
Next time—we’ll look at control over living
things at a different scale:

00:12:40.870 --> 00:12:45.899
it’s the characterization of DNA and the
birth of biotechnology.

00:12:45.899 --> 00:12:50.060
Crash Course History of Science is filmed
in the Dr. Cheryl C. Kinney studio in Missoula,

00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:54.519
Montana and it’s made with the help of all
this nice people and our animation team is

00:12:54.519 --> 00:12:55.519
Thought Cafe.

00:12:55.519 --> 00:12:56.860
Crash Course is a Complexly production.

00:12:56.860 --> 00:13:01.140
If you wanna keep imagining the world complexly
with us, you can check out some of our other

00:13:01.140 --> 00:13:03.630
channels like Nature League, Sexplanations,
and Scishow.

00:13:03.630 --> 00:13:08.209
And, if you’d like to keep Crash Course
free for everybody, forever, you can support

00:13:08.209 --> 00:13:12.699
the series at Patreon; a crowdfunding platform
that allows you to support the content you

00:13:12.699 --> 00:13:13.699
love.

00:13:13.699 --> 00:13:16.829
Thank you to all of our patrons for making
Crash Course possible with their continued

00:13:16.829 --> 00:13:18.240
support.
