00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:05.250
What do I say to someone I've trained in later claims this person claims that a

2
00:00:06.911 --> 00:00:11.260
certain thing was not covered in the training.
Uh,

3
00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:14.170
in addition to the questions is obviously excuses,

4
00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:16.540
<v 1>obviously excuses.
So this is uh,</v>

5
00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:21.760
this is a really pretty common question of how do you handle these situations.

6
00:00:21.761 --> 00:00:24.850
And I've actually been lucky enough in my life to run a lot of training into a

7
00:00:24.851 --> 00:00:26.860
lot of different situations,
mostly in the military.

8
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.320
And I've absolutely had this happen.

9
00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:34.500
And there's one thing that I do when this happens and you can probably guess

10
00:00:35.381 --> 00:00:38.530
what it is,
I take ownership of it.
So check it out.

11
00:00:38.531 --> 00:00:39.910
If somebody comes to me and says,
Oh,

12
00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:43.540
you were supposed to train us on x and you didn't,

13
00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:46.780
and I know that I did and it was in the curriculum and we covered it,
I say,

14
00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:49.870
I don't say no,
I trained you in it.
Here it is.
No,
I say,
okay,

15
00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:53.410
let's get it trained then.
Or do I gotta do lay?
Here it is.

16
00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:56.470
Let me Redo the curriculum.
Let me show it to you again because here's the thing,

17
00:00:56.471 --> 00:00:59.830
as a trainer,
it's not just your job in this,

18
00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:01.780
what I used to tell my guys when I ran training,

19
00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.150
the guys that one of the instructor cadre,
I'd say,
listen,

20
00:01:04.151 --> 00:01:08.560
it isn't your job just to run the training,
just to provide the training.

21
00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:13.000
It is your job to ensure that the training is absorbed.

22
00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:18.130
That's the difference.
That's a big difference between philosophies of training.

23
00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:21.700
I my goal when I'm training someone who is to make sure that the training is

24
00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:26.530
absorbed into the mind.
Otherwise go watch a youtube video cause a youtube video.

25
00:01:26.531 --> 00:01:29.110
You can see the same instruction.
Yeah,
but no,

26
00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.420
I need to seek you out and say,
okay where did,
where did you miss it?

27
00:01:34.421 --> 00:01:38.050
Where did and also where did I fail in my training if I covered it,

28
00:01:38.051 --> 00:01:39.440
why don't you remember it?
Yeah,

29
00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.000
that means I didn't cover it well enough or I didn't teach it well enough and I

30
00:01:43.001 --> 00:01:47.140
think that [inaudible] then you retrain them.

31
00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:48.370
You get them up to speed.

32
00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.830
At some point they're going to realize that you did train them.
I mean,

33
00:01:50.831 --> 00:01:54.580
if they truly forgot or even if they didn't forget,

34
00:01:54.581 --> 00:01:57.130
but they're just placing the blame on you,
they're going to realize that,

35
00:01:57.131 --> 00:02:02.020
you know,
they're going to know that you know,
that you trained them when they,

36
00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:04.870
when you reflect on the same information and do it again.

37
00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.470
So I think it's pretty simple answer.
Uh,

38
00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:13.240
when someone is saying you haven't trained them,
take responsibility for it.

39
00:02:13.241 --> 00:02:16.840
Take ownership for it and say,
okay,
well then let me get you trained on it.
My,

40
00:02:16.841 --> 00:02:18.940
my apologies.
I'm here to train you.

41
00:02:18.941 --> 00:02:22.450
Let me make sure that I train you and make sure that you absorb it.
Let's go.

42
00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.990
<v 0>I think that your way of training should be</v>

43
00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:34.470
done or performed with kids as well.
Like parents with their kids.

44
00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.030
You know how you,
cause you know how the kid,

45
00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.870
the kid's misbehaving and the parent's like,
I don't know why he does that.

46
00:02:39.871 --> 00:02:42.480
I told him not to pitch a fit.
Oh yeah,

47
00:02:42.481 --> 00:02:45.240
I know you probably told them or you went through the motions of telling them or

48
00:02:45.241 --> 00:02:48.780
whatever.
But man,
you gotta you gotta train them and make sure that's absorbed.

49
00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.430
You know?
Absolutely.
So,
and I always kind of think of it this way,

50
00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:57.960
not kind of,
I really think of it this way where if your kid is misbehaving,

51
00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.070
it's something you did or didn't

52
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:03.930
<v 1>do of course.
So you can't really sit there and be like,
oh,</v>

53
00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:08.950
blaming the kid for misbehaving or whatever.
Or you know,
you're,
you're right.

54
00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:09.790
I wonder,

55
00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:14.790
isn't it weird that you can have families where one kid can go to go to high

56
00:03:16.421 --> 00:03:20.830
school and do well and do great on their sats and get into a great college and

57
00:03:20.831 --> 00:03:25.690
go to and go be a doctor and the other kid can become a heroin addict?

58
00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:27.760
Yup.
Isn't that strange?
It

59
00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:29.820
<v 0>interesting.
But uh,</v>

60
00:03:29.821 --> 00:03:33.570
and I think long time ago I would talk to you about this like long time and how

61
00:03:33.571 --> 00:03:37.200
do we blame the parents and well,
that's the thing.
That's the,

62
00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:39.720
that's not what I'm saying.
I'm not saying blame the parents.

63
00:03:39.721 --> 00:03:42.480
I'm not saying that cause because that would,
if you're blaming them,

64
00:03:42.481 --> 00:03:45.090
that's like saying it's so easy.
Why didn't you do that?
I blame you.
You know,

65
00:03:45.091 --> 00:03:46.110
kind of thing.
It's not easy.

66
00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:50.040
Probably there's so many different dynamics to every kid's experience.

67
00:03:50.041 --> 00:03:52.770
So you know how,
and this is how the conversation kind of,

68
00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:55.860
if I remember correctly,
kind of started when you were like,
Hey,
I have,
you know,

69
00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:59.880
four kids or whatever,
and they're just different.
They are all,

70
00:03:59.881 --> 00:04:03.690
and then I said,
this is before I had kids,
by the way.

71
00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.870
So you weren't really feeling what else?
Yeah.
You,
you didn't,

72
00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:10.920
you don't really care about that.
Well,
not to say you didn't get it anyway.

73
00:04:10.921 --> 00:04:12.360
I said,
um,
I said,

74
00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:20.170
okay.
It's kind of complicated.
So,
oh,

75
00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:24.930
the kids are different.
Yeah.
But they're not just different,

76
00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:28.230
like that's not it.
That's not,
yes,
yes,
yes.
Fully.

77
00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:31.950
So consider every kid starting point is different.

78
00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:36.270
So you can't expect to everyone,
every kids ending point to be the same.

79
00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:40.350
Even though they go through the same experience,
just being the second born,

80
00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:45.390
you're starting out as a completely different human being,
just being two years,

81
00:04:45.391 --> 00:04:47.670
one year,
five years younger than your older brother.

82
00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:52.450
<v 1>That's what those minor variables end up creating some major,</v>

83
00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:54.190
major differences.
Yes,
of course.

84
00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:56.400
<v 0>At the,
at certain points in development,</v>

85
00:04:56.401 --> 00:05:00.210
they're going to have kind of the same needs but in a different environment.

86
00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:04.200
So the way that you fulfilled those same needs with the first kid are going to

87
00:05:04.201 --> 00:05:08.700
look different as far as them being translated with the second kid and the third

88
00:05:08.701 --> 00:05:09.534
kid and the fourth,

89
00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:10.973
<v 1>however many kids you have.</v>

90
00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:15.090
So you just going to make slight adaptations to what you did to the second kid

91
00:05:15.091 --> 00:05:18.810
than the first.
And to keep a handle of all those dynamics is it's hard.

92
00:05:18.811 --> 00:05:23.270
So that's why it's like,
well,
not only that,
it's not an exact science.
Yeah.

93
00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:27.540
And in the way kids react or way people,
it's not just,

94
00:05:27.541 --> 00:05:29.940
we're not just talking about kids here,
we're talking about people you know,

95
00:05:29.941 --> 00:05:32.970
because you get different people that you hire at different times or different

96
00:05:32.971 --> 00:05:35.190
people that joined platoons at different times and they have a different

97
00:05:35.191 --> 00:05:38.490
attitude.
So yeah,
you got to adjust.
But the bottom line is,

98
00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:42.300
the thing that remains constant through all this is that if you're trying to

99
00:05:42.301 --> 00:05:45.600
impart knowledge on people,
you need to take responsibility,

100
00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:47.520
not just for showing them the knowledge,

101
00:05:47.521 --> 00:05:49.470
but to making sure that they absorb the knowledge.

102
00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:53.310
And the primary methodology of doing that is by explaining to people why they're

103
00:05:53.311 --> 00:05:58.311
doing what they're doing and why you're telling them this and why this occurs.

104
00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:00.950
So if,
like you said,

105
00:06:00.951 --> 00:06:05.540
you tell your kid don't have a temper tantrum and then you never explained to

106
00:06:05.541 --> 00:06:07.290
them,
here's why you don't want to have a temper tantrum.

107
00:06:07.291 --> 00:06:10.190
But when you're doing this,
you could hurt yourself.
You could hurt other people.

108
00:06:10.191 --> 00:06:11.860
You're going to do things that regret.
You can invite,

109
00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:15.470
break something in the house.
I can't control you.
I can't bring you anywhere.

110
00:06:15.471 --> 00:06:17.720
If you're going to act like this,
that means we can't go out and have fun.

111
00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:20.480
So you've got to explain why.
And once you explain why,

112
00:06:20.481 --> 00:06:23.750
then people have a better chance of absorbing the information.
But yes,

113
00:06:23.751 --> 00:06:28.190
you as a trainer,
parent leader,
teacher,
has the responsibility,

114
00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:32.540
not just to impart knowledge,
but to ensure that the knowledge is absorbed.
Yeah.

115
00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:38.030
Rant.
Complete.
But,
uh,
and of course,

116
00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:42.740
like I said,
it's for parenting.
It's not like just that easy.

117
00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:46.350
No parenting is very difficult.
Leadership situations.

118
00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:50.720
That's really a lot like Plinko consider it,
you know what I mean?

119
00:06:50.721 --> 00:06:55.070
He started a different point and very well,
but yeah.
There you go.
