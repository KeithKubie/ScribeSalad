00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
SPEAKER: Mom to clump
over and become you.

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.060
Somehow, like, literally,
a piece of software

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:09.650
melded together,
fused, and then it

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:12.130
started to turn itself
into a living, breathing,

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:14.000
you know, like a
steak with a brain.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.430
Like, you're meat that
grew up inside your mother.

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:18.440
You're like a wet-ware android.

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:21.520
And now, you're grasping
all this amazing information

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:23.180
as you map and model the world.

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:23.830
You're growing.

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:24.496
You're learning.

00:00:24.496 --> 00:00:25.360
You're expanding.

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:28.140
You're slowly emerging
as a thinking being.

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.360
And it's like, oh my God, this
is what it's like to be a mind.

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:33.256
I mean, you're transcendent.

00:00:33.256 --> 00:00:34.860
You're transcendent.

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.595
You're transcendent, but
you're also made of flesh.

00:00:37.595 --> 00:00:39.750
So it's like, holding
you is like, what

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.390
is this actual piece
of divine miracle

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:47.230
that somehow this universe
allowed to organize.

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:47.730
It's insane.

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.100
Looking into your eyes actually
feels like looking at a galaxy.

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.250
It really does.
