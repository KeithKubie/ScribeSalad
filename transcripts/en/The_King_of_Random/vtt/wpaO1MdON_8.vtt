Lets get started

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:16.220
 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:59.420
Splashing and bubbling

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:47.060
Look how Dry ice is bubbling  and cooling down the water.But it is large amount of water

00:01:48.485 --> 00:01:49.485
There are many different shots of the dry ice bubbling the water this occurs because the carbon dioxide that makes up dry ice is turning back into a gas when the block gets heated up then the bubbles float to the top

00:01:55.995 --> 00:01:56.495
There are more shots of dry ice bubbling

00:01:56.495 --> 00:01:57.275
Throwing ice into pools and hot tubs and a lot of steam is coming out

00:01:58.785 --> 00:01:59.785
 

00:02:06.155 --> 00:02:06.655

00:02:06.655 --> 00:02:07.155
 

00:02:17.865 --> 00:02:18.865
 

00:03:15.775 --> 00:03:16.775
 

00:03:21.365 --> 00:03:22.365
 

00:03:40.215 --> 00:03:43.195
How does that feel? Is that freezing your hand at all?

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.280
As long as i don't hold too tightly, it doesn't.

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:47.680
