00:00:00.472 --> 00:00:02.136
Male: I'm here with Walter Isaacson and

00:00:02.136 --> 00:00:04.183
what are we about to talk about?

00:00:04.183 --> 00:00:06.003
Walter: We're talking
about the Declaration

00:00:06.003 --> 00:00:08.138
of Independence, which
happens, as it says up top,

00:00:08.138 --> 00:00:12.204
on July 4, 1776, but
what we have to remember

00:00:12.204 --> 00:00:17.091
is that for more than a
year, since April 1775 there

00:00:17.091 --> 00:00:19.270
had been a lot of fighting going on.

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:21.427
There was a revolution happening,

00:00:21.427 --> 00:00:26.005
but up until this point
the fighting was mainly

00:00:26.005 --> 00:00:28.340
against what they
considered to be the acts

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:31.603
of Parliament and Parliament's
ministers and taxing

00:00:31.603 --> 00:00:32.832
the colonies.

00:00:32.832 --> 00:00:35.670
Finally, with this document they decide

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.269
they're going to become ...

00:00:37.269 --> 00:00:39.811
The American colonies are going to become

00:00:39.811 --> 00:00:42.340
free and independent, a separate country,

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:45.340
which means rebelling
against the King himself,

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:46.676
George the III.

00:00:46.676 --> 00:00:50.004
Male: And this is George the
III in all of his regality.

00:00:50.004 --> 00:00:51.075
(laughing)

00:00:51.075 --> 00:00:52.872
Walter: Right. You know up until they met

00:00:52.872 --> 00:00:56.091
in Congress with the Continental Congress

00:00:56.091 --> 00:00:59.647
gathering themselves
together they pretended

00:00:59.647 --> 00:01:02.720
at least to respect George
the III, and they were

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:04.980
blaming everything on
the British Parliament,

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:08.674
but it was a pretty
difficult thing to decide you

00:01:08.674 --> 00:01:10.785
were going to overthrow the King himself.

00:01:10.785 --> 00:01:11.924
Male: And just to be clear,

00:01:11.924 --> 00:01:14.912
this Continental Congress it's easy now

00:01:14.912 --> 00:01:15.784
for us in hindsight.

00:01:15.784 --> 00:01:17.511
It seems like a very official thing,

00:01:17.511 --> 00:01:21.044
but this was really a rebel congress.

00:01:21.044 --> 00:01:23.183
It wasn't sanctioned in any way by

00:01:23.183 --> 00:01:24.982
kind of the formal government,

00:01:24.982 --> 00:01:26.313
by the government of Great Britain.

00:01:26.313 --> 00:01:28.179
Walter: Right, and as
you see it says the 13

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:30.262
United States of America.

00:01:30.262 --> 00:01:32.511
This is the first time
they really start using

00:01:32.511 --> 00:01:35.179
the phrase United States of America.

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:37.116
They weren't really a country yet.

00:01:37.116 --> 00:01:39.172
They were 13 different colonies,

00:01:39.172 --> 00:01:41.314
and not all of them wanted to come to

00:01:41.314 --> 00:01:42.754
this Continental Congress.

00:01:42.754 --> 00:01:45.181
Getting them all together
was quite difficult.

00:01:45.181 --> 00:01:48.755
They do so partly to
help George Washington's

00:01:48.755 --> 00:01:52.261
troops get funded because
they've started the

00:01:52.261 --> 00:01:55.512
skirmishes up in Lexington
and Concord and Massachusetts,

00:01:55.512 --> 00:02:00.050
but by 1776 George
Washington has a real army

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:02.720
and they have to fund
him, and eventually they'd

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.114
figure out well this
congress ought to decide are

00:02:05.114 --> 00:02:06.848
we really having a revolution?

00:02:06.848 --> 00:02:09.182
Are we trying to break
away from the King himself?

00:02:09.182 --> 00:02:11.113
And the answer here is yes.

00:02:11.113 --> 00:02:13.845
Male: Wow. And so this is the beginning

00:02:13.845 --> 00:02:15.179
of the Declaration of Independence

00:02:15.179 --> 00:02:18.259
and these three fellows
on the right-hand side

00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:19.319
look very familiar.

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:21.848
Walter: They're on the
committee that the Congress

00:02:21.848 --> 00:02:24.118
appoints to draft the Declaration.

00:02:24.118 --> 00:02:25.758
Actually there were five
people on the committee,

00:02:25.758 --> 00:02:28.513
but these of course are
the three most important.

00:02:28.513 --> 00:02:32.005
Thomas Jefferson only
33 years old, by far the

00:02:32.005 --> 00:02:34.340
youngest person on the committee

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:37.450
and he's chosen to write the first draft.

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:40.594
Then Benjamin Franklin, who is a mentor

00:02:40.594 --> 00:02:44.050
of Jefferson's, a printer
from Philadelphia.

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:47.846
Franklin had just been spending
the past two decades almost

00:02:47.846 --> 00:02:50.179
going back and forth to
England to try to prevent

00:02:50.179 --> 00:02:51.590
a revolution.

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.387
Then John Adams, the
very passionate sage from

00:02:55.387 --> 00:02:59.387
the State of Massachusetts
who was the one who

00:02:59.387 --> 00:03:01.847
was most in favor of revolution.

00:03:01.847 --> 00:03:03.928
In fact, when Franklin comes back

00:03:03.928 --> 00:03:09.849
to Philadelphia in early
1776 after having tried

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:12.924
to hold Britain and America
together most of these

00:03:12.924 --> 00:03:15.007
people didn't know whether
he would be on the side

00:03:15.007 --> 00:03:16.520
of revolution or not.

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:19.039
In fact, his own son, William Franklin,

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:21.848
is, at this time of this Declaration,

00:03:21.848 --> 00:03:23.649
the Royal Governor of New Jersey

00:03:23.649 --> 00:03:25.720
and is staying loyal to King George.

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.924
Male: And just to, once
again emphasize the context,

00:03:27.924 --> 00:03:29.514
the Royal Governor of New Jersey.

00:03:29.514 --> 00:03:31.088
This wasn't like the
Governor of New Jersey

00:03:31.088 --> 00:03:31.783
we imagine now.

00:03:31.783 --> 00:03:32.928
He wasn't elected by the people.

00:03:32.928 --> 00:03:34.117
He was appointed.

00:03:34.117 --> 00:03:35.115
Walter: No, he was appointed by the King.

00:03:35.115 --> 00:03:37.706
He was the Royal Governor, and you know

00:03:37.706 --> 00:03:39.514
Franklin was proud of
his son, but they have

00:03:39.514 --> 00:03:43.595
this incredible split
starting in 1776 where

00:03:43.595 --> 00:03:46.345
William Franklin remains
loyal to the crown

00:03:46.345 --> 00:03:49.117
and loyal to King George the III who had

00:03:49.117 --> 00:03:50.339
made him Governor of New Jersey.

00:03:50.339 --> 00:03:51.514
Male: Now, one thing
that you had mentioned

00:03:51.514 --> 00:03:54.345
a few seconds ago that
I think is surprising

00:03:54.345 --> 00:03:57.114
is when you mentioned that
Jefferson was 33 years

00:03:57.114 --> 00:04:00.050
old when he wrote the
Declaration of Independence.

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:02.447
How normal was that?

00:04:02.447 --> 00:04:03.784
You know back then it seemed like people

00:04:03.784 --> 00:04:06.246
did I guess mature faster, but he was

00:04:06.246 --> 00:04:08.986
still perceived as a fairly young person.

00:04:08.986 --> 00:04:11.447
Walter: Yes. They all loved to be thinking

00:04:11.447 --> 00:04:13.453
of themselves as young rebels too.

00:04:13.453 --> 00:04:15.781
In fact, Jefferson I think
is the second youngest

00:04:15.781 --> 00:04:17.181
person in the Continental Congress,

00:04:17.181 --> 00:04:19.671
but there was a third person
who lied about his age

00:04:19.671 --> 00:04:22.980
to pretend to be younger
and actually wasn't.

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:25.414
Jefferson was a good wordsmith.

00:04:25.414 --> 00:04:27.847
He was from Virginia and
it was very important

00:04:27.847 --> 00:04:29.518
of this person from ...

00:04:29.518 --> 00:04:31.332
Franklin from Pennsylvania and Adams from

00:04:31.332 --> 00:04:34.117
Massachusetts to make
sure we got Virginia in

00:04:34.117 --> 00:04:36.982
because Virginia, there
was a chance it would

00:04:36.982 --> 00:04:39.245
remain loyal and ...

00:04:39.245 --> 00:04:40.499
Male: It was a large wealthy ...

00:04:40.499 --> 00:04:43.663
Walter: A large wealthy land-owning colony

00:04:43.663 --> 00:04:46.849
and so getting the
Virginians in, and there were

00:04:46.849 --> 00:04:48.998
very strong rebels from Virginia.

00:04:48.998 --> 00:04:52.650
The Lees of Virginia as
well as Jefferson were

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:55.114
in favor of declaring independence

00:04:55.114 --> 00:04:57.849
so they decide they want
to make sure that Jefferson

00:04:57.849 --> 00:04:59.459
gets to write the first draft.

00:04:59.459 --> 00:05:00.511
Male: Interesting.

00:05:00.511 --> 00:05:04.516
And so what we see here,
this is the final text.

00:05:04.516 --> 00:05:06.314
This is the official
Declaration of Independence.

00:05:06.314 --> 00:05:06.883
Walter: Right.

00:05:06.883 --> 00:05:08.585
Male: In the future videos
we can talk about previous

00:05:08.585 --> 00:05:09.300
drafts.

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:10.794
Walter: Right. They
went through five drafts

00:05:10.794 --> 00:05:14.716
to get to this draft and this is the

00:05:14.716 --> 00:05:16.842
one that they do after unaninously

00:05:16.842 --> 00:05:21.248
all 13 colonies, now
called the 13 United States

00:05:21.248 --> 00:05:24.780
in this document, declare
this to be the cause

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:26.447
of the colonies.

00:05:26.447 --> 00:05:28.582
And what you can see
in the first paragraph

00:05:28.582 --> 00:05:32.127
is they have to explain why
are we writing this document.

00:05:32.127 --> 00:05:35.511
They say well if you're
going to have a revolution,

00:05:35.511 --> 00:05:37.777
if you're going to dissolve
the political bands

00:05:37.777 --> 00:05:40.381
which have connected you
with another state, then

00:05:40.381 --> 00:05:46.782
the laws of nature and
of nature's God entitle

00:05:46.782 --> 00:05:48.535
them a decent respect.

00:05:49.596 --> 00:05:53.069
This is the equal station
they get because of nature

00:05:53.069 --> 00:05:54.455
and nature's God.

00:05:54.455 --> 00:05:56.563
It's a pretty interesting phrase.

00:05:56.563 --> 00:05:58.119
Male: Let's read the whole thing.

00:05:58.119 --> 00:05:58.731
Walter: Yeah.

00:05:58.731 --> 00:06:00.728
Male: "When in the course of human events

00:06:00.728 --> 00:06:03.246
it becomes necessary for
one people to dissolve

00:06:03.246 --> 00:06:05.645
the political bands," this is
what you were talking about,

00:06:05.645 --> 00:06:07.248
"which have connected them with another

00:06:07.248 --> 00:06:09.583
and to assume among
the powers of the earth

00:06:09.583 --> 00:06:13.188
the separate and equal station
which the laws of nature

00:06:13.188 --> 00:06:15.918
and of nature's God entitle them."

00:06:15.918 --> 00:06:17.113
Walter: What they're saying right there

00:06:17.113 --> 00:06:19.907
is that the laws of
nature and the fact that

00:06:19.907 --> 00:06:22.580
nature's God created us
all equally means that

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:25.914
one set of people don't
have to be subserviant to

00:06:25.914 --> 00:06:29.854
or occupied by or colonies
of another set of people.

00:06:29.854 --> 00:06:33.818
They want to be free and independent,

00:06:33.818 --> 00:06:35.985
and it's interesting
that they use the phrase,

00:06:35.985 --> 00:06:38.581
"Laws of nature and nature's
God," because this is

00:06:38.581 --> 00:06:40.914
sort of the beginning of
the enlightenment where

00:06:40.914 --> 00:06:43.188
we're supposed to understand that nature

00:06:43.188 --> 00:06:44.919
gives us our rights and reasons.

00:06:44.919 --> 00:06:47.393
John Locke, the great British philosopher,

00:06:47.393 --> 00:06:50.729
believed in the laws of nature, and these

00:06:50.729 --> 00:06:51.849
were deists.

00:06:51.849 --> 00:06:54.812
They kind of were religious
a bit, but they didn't

00:06:54.812 --> 00:06:57.915
subscribe to any
particular religious dogma,

00:06:57.915 --> 00:07:01.067
and so they just talk
about nature's God allowing

00:07:01.067 --> 00:07:04.645
us all to be free and equal.

00:07:04.645 --> 00:07:05.818
Male: Right.

00:07:05.818 --> 00:07:08.151
"A decent respect to
the opinions of mankind

00:07:08.151 --> 00:07:09.566
requires that they
should declare the causes

00:07:09.566 --> 00:07:10.978
which impel them to a separation."

00:07:10.978 --> 00:07:11.852
So that's really just saying ...

00:07:11.852 --> 00:07:13.645
Walter: What they're
saying is we care what the

00:07:13.645 --> 00:07:15.153
rest of you think.

00:07:15.153 --> 00:07:18.704
And by the way, it's directed
at one particular people,

00:07:18.704 --> 00:07:20.026
the French, because we're not going to win

00:07:20.026 --> 00:07:21.938
this revolution in the
United States unless

00:07:21.938 --> 00:07:23.781
the French help support us.

00:07:23.781 --> 00:07:26.382
The French, by the way,
were already at war

00:07:26.382 --> 00:07:28.316
with the British.

00:07:28.316 --> 00:07:31.851
There's been a long set of wars throughout

00:07:31.851 --> 00:07:34.380
the 18th century where France and Britian

00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:35.656
were fighting each other.

00:07:35.656 --> 00:07:38.114
So, this document is particularly aimed

00:07:38.114 --> 00:07:40.274
at saying to the French,
you've been fighting

00:07:40.274 --> 00:07:44.047
Britain for a long time so
we have a decent respect

00:07:44.047 --> 00:07:47.450
for all the opinions of
mankind, but yours in particular

00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:49.717
and we're going to tell
you why we're fighting this

00:07:49.717 --> 00:07:53.851
and of course in France at the
time this notion of liberty,

00:07:53.851 --> 00:07:57.274
equality, fraternity,
that's bubbling up as well.

00:07:57.274 --> 00:08:02.838
So, the document is to
try to persuade other

00:08:02.838 --> 00:08:04.276
nations please support us.

00:08:04.276 --> 00:08:05.636
We're explaining why we're
having this revolution.

00:08:05.636 --> 00:08:07.550
Male: And that's I think
important to remember

00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:10.249
for someone in 21st century America.

00:08:10.249 --> 00:08:12.314
It's obviously a major world power now,

00:08:12.314 --> 00:08:14.181
the major world power.

00:08:14.181 --> 00:08:16.851
But back then this was
like a little colony.

00:08:16.851 --> 00:08:18.446
It's kind of a sideshow.

00:08:18.446 --> 00:08:19.652
Walter: Right, right.

00:08:19.652 --> 00:08:22.198
And it's important for
us to remember now too

00:08:22.198 --> 00:08:24.025
that whenever we do something, whenever

00:08:24.025 --> 00:08:25.979
we get involved in the
world we should have

00:08:25.979 --> 00:08:28.514
a decent respect to the
opinions of mankind.

00:08:28.514 --> 00:08:28.983
Male: Right.

00:08:28.983 --> 00:08:30.986
Walter: That's how we
started as a nation saying

00:08:30.986 --> 00:08:32.589
when we do something
we're going to be open.

00:08:32.589 --> 00:08:35.481
We're going to be honest.

00:08:35.559 --> 00:08:38.000
We're going to explain to you why.
