Now I want to mention two less frequently used UML diagram types.

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:10.500
One is the interaction overview diagram. It's a kind of activity diagram,

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.880
where the nodes in the diagram correspond to lower level interaction diagrams

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.550
which could be of any sort, sequence, communication, interaction overview, and

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:20.590
timing diagrams.

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:25.270
In the diagram example, the term ref denotes a specific interaction occurrence.
