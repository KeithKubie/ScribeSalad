00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:02.524
 Part of the second law of thermodynamics 

00:00:02.524 --> 00:00:03.904
 says that 

00:00:03.904 --> 00:00:07.944
 entropy in the universe is only increasing. 

00:00:07.944 --> 00:00:09.488
 I put an exclamation mark here, 

00:00:09.488 --> 00:00:11.566
 because it sounds like a very profound statement. 

00:00:11.566 --> 00:00:13.284
 At all levels, it is. 

00:00:13.284 --> 00:00:15.107
 And in order to get a proper attitude to the lesson, 

00:00:15.107 --> 00:00:17.301
 I show this picture of the night sky 

00:00:17.301 --> 00:00:20.088
 from the Hubble Space Telescope. 

00:00:20.088 --> 00:00:21.178
 Each of these points 

00:00:21.178 --> 00:00:22.304
 is not a star. 

00:00:22.304 --> 00:00:23.361
 Every point is a galaxy. 

00:00:23.361 --> 00:00:24.301
 This is a galaxy. 

00:00:24.301 --> 00:00:25.439
 This is a galaxy here. 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:26.658
 This is a galaxy. 

00:00:26.658 --> 00:00:28.504
 I hope this picture will 

00:00:28.504 --> 00:00:31.023
 they put you in a more "cosmic" mood. 

00:00:31.023 --> 00:00:32.927
 Let us think what the initial statement says. 

00:00:32.927 --> 00:00:36.084
 Entropy in the universe only increases. 

00:00:36.084 --> 00:00:40.438
 We can define entropy as disorder 

00:00:40.438 --> 00:00:41.564
 in one system. 

00:00:41.564 --> 00:00:42.598
 We're talking about the number 

00:00:42.598 --> 00:00:45.163
 conditions a system can accept. 

00:00:45.163 --> 00:00:46.522
 Then we say in the universe. 

00:00:46.522 --> 00:00:47.496
 We can also say that entropy 

00:00:47.496 --> 00:00:49.806
 a closed system can only increase. 

00:00:49.806 --> 00:00:51.803
 A system that is completely closed, 

00:00:51.803 --> 00:00:53.265
 is a system that does not interact with its surroundings, 

00:00:53.265 --> 00:00:55.333
 and the universe is a closed system. 

00:00:55.333 --> 00:00:57.667
 There is nothing beyond her that can interact 

00:00:57.667 --> 00:00:59.257
 thermodynamic. 

00:00:59.257 --> 00:01:01.474
 I will make a quick revision of open and closed systems, 

00:01:01.474 --> 00:01:03.437
 to make sure you understand them. 

00:01:03.437 --> 00:01:04.737
 If I had a campfire, 

00:01:04.737 --> 00:01:07.304
 I have a few splitters, and here 

00:01:07.304 --> 00:01:09.324
 I have a fire. 

00:01:09.324 --> 00:01:11.030
 It's a campfire. 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.583
 If we only concentrate on wood and fire, 

00:01:14.583 --> 00:01:16.707
 this will be an open system. 

00:01:16.707 --> 00:01:18.588
 Because it obviously has thermodynamic interactions 

00:01:18.588 --> 00:01:19.785
 with the middle. 

00:01:19.785 --> 00:01:20.991
 The system radiates heat. 

00:01:20.991 --> 00:01:24.787
 Warm the molecules of air around you. 

00:01:24.787 --> 00:01:27.585
 It radiates light into the universe. 

00:01:27.585 --> 00:01:29.872
 There may be interaction between the rest of the 

00:01:29.872 --> 00:01:31.602
 universe and system. 

00:01:31.602 --> 00:01:34.840
 So it is not isolated from everything else. 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.627
 But the closed system is isolated. 

00:01:37.627 --> 00:01:38.950
 It is very difficult to get 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:41.922
 created a truly closed system in everyday life. 

00:01:41.922 --> 00:01:43.141
 But we can get closer to one. 

00:01:43.141 --> 00:01:44.569
 Closed system you may know 

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:48.644
 from the near past, is the cold bag. 

00:01:48.644 --> 00:01:50.861
 In a cold bag we try, 

00:01:50.861 --> 00:01:55.756
 thermodynamically isolate 

00:01:55.756 --> 00:01:57.881
 the inside of the bag 

00:01:57.881 --> 00:02:00.737
 from the outside environment, from the rest of the universe. 

00:02:00.737 --> 00:02:04.522
 That's how it works, we have some kind of thing 

00:02:04.522 --> 00:02:05.763
 insulating material. 

00:02:05.763 --> 00:02:07.656
 For example, styrofoam. 

00:02:07.656 --> 00:02:08.735
 We can use the refrigerator bag, 

00:02:08.735 --> 00:02:10.500
 to store ice. 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.543
 But it is not a perfect closed system, 

00:02:12.543 --> 00:02:14.459
 because in the end, the heat from 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:17.779
 the rest of the universe will warm the walls of the refrigerator bag. 

00:02:17.779 --> 00:02:20.820
 Then this heat will surrender 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.213
 and will warm up 

00:02:22.213 --> 00:02:23.421
 ice. 

00:02:23.421 --> 00:02:26.138
 It will melt it. 

00:02:26.138 --> 00:02:27.902
 This is not a prefab closed system, 

00:02:27.902 --> 00:02:29.342
 but it comes close to one, 

00:02:29.342 --> 00:02:30.619
 because at least we try 

00:02:30.619 --> 00:02:33.231
 to isolate it from thermodynamic interactions 

00:02:33.231 --> 00:02:34.578
 with the rest of the universe. 

00:02:34.578 --> 00:02:35.994
 I can make her cover, 

00:02:35.994 --> 00:02:38.554
 to show that we really try to isolate it. 

00:02:38.554 --> 00:02:39.703
 In scientific laboratories 

00:02:39.703 --> 00:02:41.456
 you can see much better models 

00:02:41.456 --> 00:02:42.176
 of closed systems. 

00:02:42.176 --> 00:02:45.029
 But even at a certain level, 

00:02:45.029 --> 00:02:46.619
 interact with the rest of the universe. 

00:02:46.619 --> 00:02:48.106
 Really closed system 

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:53.028
 is the universe. 

00:02:53.028 --> 00:02:56.858
 Outside it there is nothing that can have thermodynamic interactions. 

00:02:56.858 --> 00:03:00.121
 Let's think about this definition. 

00:03:00.121 --> 00:03:02.663
 Entropy in the universe can only increase. 

00:03:02.663 --> 00:03:04.495
 Why does this sound logical? 

00:03:04.495 --> 00:03:06.251
 The best example I can think of, 

00:03:06.251 --> 00:03:08.502
 is a simple diffusion. 

00:03:08.502 --> 00:03:11.902
 Let's say I have a court. 

00:03:11.902 --> 00:03:13.725
 I have a court, 

00:03:13.725 --> 00:03:15.640
 I will do it 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.660
 closed vessel. 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:19.227
 Let's say this is some kind of thing 

00:03:19.227 --> 00:03:22.384
 a theoretical ideal closed system. 

00:03:22.384 --> 00:03:24.707
 Let's say I have the ideal gas. 

00:03:24.707 --> 00:03:28.724
 I have molecules of ideal gas here. 

00:03:28.724 --> 00:03:30.024
 They have an average temperature, 

00:03:30.024 --> 00:03:32.821
 but this means that each molecule has its own 

00:03:32.821 --> 00:03:36.258
 own kinetic energy. 

00:03:36.258 --> 00:03:38.852
 Everyone moves in different directions. 

00:03:38.852 --> 00:03:40.988
 What will happen over time? 

00:03:40.988 --> 00:03:43.308
 Those on the left 

00:03:43.308 --> 00:03:45.028
 will bounce off this wall. 

00:03:45.028 --> 00:03:46.270
 And they will go 

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:47.152
 in this way. 

00:03:47.152 --> 00:03:49.207
 Over time, we will come to a situation where, 

00:03:49.207 --> 00:03:52.945
 in which the system will look like this. 

00:03:52.945 --> 00:03:56.706
 The system will 

00:03:56.706 --> 00:03:59.028
 it looks like that. These six particles - 

00:03:59.028 --> 00:04:00.950
 These six particles will spread 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:03.957
 in court. 

00:04:03.957 --> 00:04:05.814
 They will spread to the vessel through diffusion. 

00:04:05.814 --> 00:04:09.730
 They will occupy much of the space in the court. 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:11.598
 What happened during this process? 

00:04:11.598 --> 00:04:13.979
 When particles were limited 

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:16.788
 in this small part of the court, 

00:04:16.788 --> 00:04:18.494
 there were fewer possible system states. 

00:04:18.494 --> 00:04:20.968
 We had a lower entropy than here, 

00:04:20.968 --> 00:04:23.394
 when the particles filled the vessel. 

00:04:23.394 --> 00:04:25.112
 Now there are more possible locations 

00:04:25.112 --> 00:04:26.854
 and more possible system orientations. 

00:04:26.854 --> 00:04:28.896
 We have more different states. 

00:04:28.896 --> 00:04:30.394
 We have higher entrances, 

00:04:30.394 --> 00:04:34.014
 higher, higher, 

00:04:34.014 --> 00:04:36.707
 higher entropy. 

00:04:36.707 --> 00:04:40.109
 In general, the processes in which entropy 

00:04:40.109 --> 00:04:43.313
 are rising, are called irreversible processes, 

00:04:43.313 --> 00:04:47.771
 irreversible, irreversible processes. 

00:04:47.771 --> 00:04:49.791
 Why are they irreversible? 

00:04:49.791 --> 00:04:51.451
 There is some possibility 

00:04:51.451 --> 00:04:53.715
 molecules to reunite 

00:04:53.715 --> 00:04:55.270
 in this corner of the vessel. 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:57.592
 But it is very small. 

00:04:57.592 --> 00:04:58.496
 And this is an example only 

00:04:58.496 --> 00:04:59.495
 with six molecules. 

00:04:59.495 --> 00:05:02.815
 In a real system we will have 

00:05:02.815 --> 00:05:03.871
 much more than six molecules. 

00:05:03.871 --> 00:05:05.531
 We will have millions, millions, 

00:05:05.531 --> 00:05:10.233
 millions, millions of molecules. 

00:05:10.233 --> 00:05:14.470
 We're talking about 20 to 30 zeros. 

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:15.608
 That's why 

00:05:15.608 --> 00:05:17.709
 it is very unlikely that they will all cum together 

00:05:17.709 --> 00:05:20.612
 and to create a smaller volume, 

00:05:20.612 --> 00:05:22.748
 when they have already executed the court. 

00:05:24.187 --> 00:05:28.831
 That's why we do not see smoke turning naturally 

00:05:28.831 --> 00:05:31.074
 in some shaped particle 

00:05:31.074 --> 00:05:33.269
 or take up less space, 

00:05:33.269 --> 00:05:35.009
 instead of throwing out the court. 

00:05:35.009 --> 00:05:36.170
 This is irreversible, 

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:39.572
 because we started with a smaller number 

00:05:39.572 --> 00:05:40.637
 possible states 

00:05:40.637 --> 00:05:41.433
 and a smaller volume, 

00:05:41.433 --> 00:05:45.739
 but we have received a greater number of possible states. 

00:05:45.739 --> 00:05:48.293
 The universe is constantly doing this. 

00:05:48.293 --> 00:05:50.568
 That's why entropy in the universe can only grow. 

00:05:50.568 --> 00:05:52.309
 There are some processes, 

00:05:52.309 --> 00:05:54.992
 where it seems that entropy does not increase so much. 

00:05:54.992 --> 00:05:58.009
 If we have a billiard ball here, 

00:05:58.009 --> 00:06:00.750
 and we roll it down, 

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:03.431
 she will hit another billiard ball here, 

00:06:03.431 --> 00:06:06.589
 will impart the impulse to the other ball. 

00:06:06.589 --> 00:06:08.969
 It seems like this can happen in the other direction. 

00:06:08.969 --> 00:06:10.908
 As if the other billiard ball could hit this one 

00:06:10.908 --> 00:06:12.196
 and bring it back. 

00:06:12.196 --> 00:06:13.415
 At macro level 

00:06:13.415 --> 00:06:15.388
 this seems like a reversible process. 

00:06:15.388 --> 00:06:18.116
 People can call it reversible. 

00:06:20.496 --> 00:06:22.923
 It seems as if entropy does not increase so much. 

00:06:22.923 --> 00:06:25.106
 But if we go down to a micro level - 

00:06:25.106 --> 00:06:26.221
 I'll make it clear. 

00:06:26.221 --> 00:06:28.100
 First, this ball moves, 

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:29.227
 and this is immobile, 

00:06:29.227 --> 00:06:31.235
 then we are in a state where this moves, 

00:06:31.235 --> 00:06:32.163
 and this is still. 

00:06:32.163 --> 00:06:33.974
 It does not seem that entropy has increased so much. 

00:06:33.974 --> 00:06:36.060
 Sometimes this process is called reversible because 

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:37.441
 we can see 

00:06:37.441 --> 00:06:39.995
 cases in which this ball is back. 

00:06:39.995 --> 00:06:41.063
 Pink can hit the yellow 

00:06:41.063 --> 00:06:42.171
 and the bail can go back, 

00:06:42.171 --> 00:06:44.585
 as if we were returning the film strip. 

00:06:44.585 --> 00:06:48.149
 But even if that happens if we look at the micro level, 

00:06:48.149 --> 00:06:50.668
 we will see that heat has been created. 

00:06:50.668 --> 00:06:53.861
 Some molecules of the billiard ball pass at a higher energy level 

00:06:53.861 --> 00:06:56.183
 from collisions with each other and friction with the air, 

00:06:56.183 --> 00:07:00.025
 as the ball rolls over the ground. 

00:07:00.025 --> 00:07:01.906
 These molecules never 

00:07:01.906 --> 00:07:04.240
 will not return to their previous state. 

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:07.339
 So, actually, entropy 

00:07:07.339 --> 00:07:08.465
 in the system is increasing. 

00:07:08.465 --> 00:07:09.939
 Even in our everyday life 

00:07:09.939 --> 00:07:11.263
 and in thermodynamics, 

00:07:11.263 --> 00:07:13.747
 people to talk about reversible processes, 

00:07:13.747 --> 00:07:15.860
 they are only approximately reversible. 

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:19.227
 Even when entropy increased only a little, 

00:07:19.227 --> 00:07:21.966
 this increase is greater than zero. 

00:07:21.966 --> 00:07:24.381
 Here we have irreversible reactions. 

00:07:24.381 --> 00:07:26.204
 Diffusion is an obvious example. 

00:07:26.204 --> 00:07:28.641
 It is clear that we have an increase 

00:07:28.641 --> 00:07:31.265
 of entropy and probability 

00:07:31.265 --> 00:07:34.237
 this system returns to its original state 

00:07:34.237 --> 00:07:36.396
 is very small. 

00:07:36.396 --> 00:07:37.360
 In reality, this can not be observed, 

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:39.264
 because we are talking about molecules whose number is a number 

00:07:39.264 --> 00:07:41.562
 with 20 to 30 zeros. 

00:07:41.562 --> 00:07:43.559
 The probability of returning to their initial state is very small, 

00:07:43.559 --> 00:07:45.858
 you will have to wait a very long time 

00:07:45.858 --> 00:07:49.840
 and you will never see something like this happen again. 

00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:51.024
 I hope it is clear. 

00:07:51.024 --> 00:07:52.324
 The disorder, 

00:07:52.324 --> 00:07:54.123
 the number of states that a system may have, 

00:07:54.123 --> 00:07:55.714
 increases with increasing number of interactions. 

00:07:55.714 --> 00:07:57.757
 That's why warmth is very important. 

00:07:57.757 --> 00:07:59.080
 Everything You Do - 

00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:00.183
 While I'm doing this video, 

00:08:00.183 --> 00:08:01.623
 my body produces heat. 

00:08:01.623 --> 00:08:03.480
 The heat dissipates in the universe. 

00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:05.500
 This adds more possible states, 

00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:07.938
 which the universe can accept. 

00:08:07.938 --> 00:08:09.064
 When I move my hand, 

00:08:09.064 --> 00:08:13.058
 the digital pencil I use creates friction. 

00:08:13.058 --> 00:08:14.961
 It also releases heat in the universe. 

00:08:14.961 --> 00:08:16.622
 My computer is working, it also releases heat 

00:08:16.622 --> 00:08:17.481
 in the universe. 

00:08:17.481 --> 00:08:19.338
 Watching this video, you also release heat in the universe, 

00:08:19.338 --> 00:08:21.962
 The electronics that run in your computer's cables, 

00:08:21.962 --> 00:08:23.355
 emit heat in the universe. 

00:08:23.355 --> 00:08:25.479
 All this increases the number of states the system can take, 

00:08:25.479 --> 00:08:29.572
 when we think of a molecular level.
