00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:04.860
Design guidelines are one of several ways of gauging the quality of

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:06.120
your designs.

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.190
Of course, the ultimate validation of a design is to build a program and

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:12.035
have its users report their satisfaction.

00:00:12.035 --> 00:00:15.680
Short of that, you can build a prototype or conduct design reviews.

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:18.580
There are also various metrics based on the structural properties of

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:23.720
your design that compute actual numbers assessing the design's quality.

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:26.870
Least expensive, but conceivably most valuable,

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:29.480
is adherence to the principles we will go over in this lesson.
