Hi everyone.

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:09.720
Welcome to this week's Google+
platform office hours.

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:12.820
This week, I'm sitting at a
table because we're going to

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:15.570
be doing some live coding.

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.510
We're going to be writing a
jQuery plug-in that uses the

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:23.820
JavaScript client library to
pull activity from your

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.610
Google+ page or your profile
and insert it

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:29.530
into your web page.

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:31.820
And we're doing this
in a jQuery

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:33.440
plug-in by popular demand.

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:34.490
I sent out a little survey.

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:37.950
So thanks for your feedback
if you voted on that.

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.240
So before I dive into the--
oh, and then after that, I

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:44.813
will be fielding your questions
that you've asked on

00:00:44.813 --> 00:00:50.715
the Google+ platform page.

00:00:50.715 --> 00:00:53.640
Oh, I guess I should introduce
myself first. Hi,

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:54.600
I'm Jennifer Murphy.

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.750
I'm a developer programs
engineer here at Google.

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.090
And what I do is, I help you
guys all build cool stuff

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:02.290
using the Google+ API.

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:06.190
It's like the stuff we're going
to be working on today.

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:10.190
But yeah, not limited just
to the REST APIs.

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:12.700
Feel free to ask questions
about hangouts apps, the

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:14.190
plug-ins or anything
else that's part

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:16.530
of the Google+ platform.

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.790
OK, well, let's see what we're
going to be writing today.

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:20.730
Dive right into the content.

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:23.280
So, let me show you a
quick demo of what

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.670
we're going to build.

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:26.670
Built it last night, and
then I put it into my

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.580
personal web page.

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:34.210
So, switching over to screen
sharing, you can see this on

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:38.625
the left side, underneath the
badge, there's a little box

00:01:38.625 --> 00:01:40.120
that shows recent activity.

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:41.420
And that's showing
recent activity

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.050
from my Google+ profile.

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:47.790
And that's kind of cool on my
hub page to be able to show

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.760
people what I've been
up to recently.

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:52.260
And this is implemented with the
jQuery plug-in that we'll

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:53.400
be building.

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.880
So when you're done going
through this demo, you'll be

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:00.260
able to put something like
that on your web page.

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:06.100
So let's switch over, and gonna
show you a little bit of

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.949
the design behind what
we're building.

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:12.970
So to accomplish that using
a jQuery plug-in, there's

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.830
actually a few different
pieces that go into it.

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:22.120
We have our index HTML file,
which is the web page itself.

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.570
And it's calling out
to a couple things.

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:24.510
First of all, we're
going to need to

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.940
include the jQuery library.

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.630
That's what we need to
wire up the plug-ins

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:31.170
and do all that stuff.

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.150
We have our plug-in itself,
which will then be making use

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.800
of the Google API JavaScript
client library.

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.700
And that will then be making
calls to the Google+ REST APIs

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.330
to fetch our activities.

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.400
And once it's fetched our
activities, the data kind of

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.190
goes back up the whole
stack and then

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.280
renders in our HTML document.

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.160
So there's a lot of pieces
involved, but each one of

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:52.790
those pieces is actually
pretty simple.

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:54.775
So we'll go through them one at
a time as we implement it.

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:59.100
Time to dive into the code.

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:06.020
Screen share again, switching
screens to my IDE, where we'll

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:07.970
be doing the coding.

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:09.930
We'll make it a little smaller
so it's easier for you to see

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:11.180
on the web page.

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:15.210
So what do we have open?

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:17.580
I mentioned that there's an HTML
file, which is what we

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:22.860
have open right now, and the
jQuery plug-in are the two

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:25.050
files we're going to be editing
during this live

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:26.190
coding session.

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:30.930
Let's take a look at the HTML
file first. It's a skeleton.

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:32.760
It looks a lot like you
would expect a lot of

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.600
jQuery demos to look.

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.290
We have all of our libraries
loaded that

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:37.280
were going to need.

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:41.640
We have jQuery itself, loaded
off of GoogleAPIs.com because

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:43.360
CDMI's libraries are great.

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:46.540
They're fast and easy to use.

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:48.880
We have our plug-in which is
right now [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.550
plug-in, which I'll be going
through in a moment.

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:56.600
And we also have the Google
JavaScript client library, and

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:57.790
it's configured such
that when it

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:00.480
loads, it calls a function--

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:01.790
gapi.Ready().

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:04.250
And this is where we'll be
wiring up everything because

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:06.380
we need the client library to be
fully loaded before we can

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:08.450
invoke our plug-in.

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:11.530
Scrolling going down the page,
there's a couple of divs--

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:14.730
recent-activity and
recent-activity-2.

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:16.579
So these are places where we're
going to be inserting

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:20.019
the activity into the pages
in the jQuery plug-in.

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:22.770
So if you've done jQuery before
this should look pretty

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:25.090
straightforward.

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:27.980
Next, let's take a look
at the plug-in.

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:29.960
Here is an empty plug-in.

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:32.260
It's kind of a skeleton that
I use to build a lot of my

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.470
jQuery plug-ins.

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:36.270
If you've done plug-in
development in jQuery before,

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:38.150
this should look pretty
familiar.

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:40.930
But you can ignore a lot of
it if you haven't done the

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:42.340
development.

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:44.080
Up on the top-- a lot
of it's just kind

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:46.670
of boilerplate jQuery.

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:48.400
But near the top, there's
a settings area.

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:52.410
And this is where any
configuration for our plug-in,

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:54.626
all of the defaults
will be set.

00:04:54.626 --> 00:04:57.710
Then there's more boilerplate
name-spacing.

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:01.320
And the primary iterator
that goes through and--

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:03.470
so that if you're operator of a
collection of objects, it'll

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:05.660
work on all of them

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:06.780
And then finally doStuff.

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:08.805
This is where we'll actually
be implementing our stuff.

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:16.530
And then the other file I have
open is nothing more than the

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:18.390
JavaScript client
library sample.

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:20.810
So I just went to the
documentation, grabbed the

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:22.640
sample code right out of
the wiki page, and

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:24.190
pasted it into here.

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:27.250
And I did that because writing
code from scratch, especially

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:29.720
the first time, can be
pretty challenging.

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:32.590
So I usually will work
samples if I can.

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:34.310
So what we're going to be doing,
is we're probably going

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:37.460
to be copying a lot of the code
out of the sample, and

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:40.350
then modifying it to
fit our needs.

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:42.810
OK, we've seen what
we have opened.

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:44.060
Let's get into the code.

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:48.840
So the first thing we should
do is probably wire stuff

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:54.135
together because we have our
HTML file, but the plug-in is

00:05:54.135 --> 00:05:56.116
not actually being called yet.

00:05:56.116 --> 00:05:59.610
And we're going to be calling
the plug-in from gapi.ready().

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:02.215
This is a little bit different
than a lot of jQuery you

00:06:02.215 --> 00:06:05.990
write, because you usually
probably trigger your jQuery

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:07.920
from the onload of the document

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:10.710
itself, like the ready.

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:12.610
But we need all of the
pieces to be ready.

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:14.470
In addition to the document,
we need that the JavaScript

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:15.640
client library to be ready.

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:17.970
So that's why we're using
a different function

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:23.660
to line it all up.

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:26.000
We're going to be
operating below.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.140
What we're going to do first is,
we're going to replace the

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:31.790
recent activity div with
some activities.

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:36.100
So let's see what we're going to
write here for the jQuery.

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:46.900
We're going to do a selector
for the recent activity,

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:48.940
except spelled right.

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:51.150
And that's going to use your
query to grab that recent

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:58.380
activity div. And then we're
going to call our plug-in,

00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:00.435
which is just the name of the
function in the plug-in.

00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:04.290
And then we're going
to pass in any

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:05.540
configuration that we want.

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:10.920
This is where we have to do
a little bit of thinking.

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:14.070
So for the rest API to be able
to call our activity to get

00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:15.620
access to our public
activity, we need a

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:17.780
minimum of two fields.

00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:23.440
We need an API key, which you
can get by going to the API

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:25.700
Council and registering a
new project, which is--

00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:28.780
I covered in a previous
video, which I'll link

00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:31.220
to in the show notes.

00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:34.490
So we're going to need an API
key at the minimum, and we're

00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:37.520
also going to need to know the
ID of the profiler page from

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:41.190
which we're getting
our activities.

00:07:41.190 --> 00:07:42.440
So userId.

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:49.180
And I've already done these, so
I'll just paste in values.

00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:56.540
Here's an API key, and here is
the userId of my profile on

00:07:56.540 --> 00:07:58.260
Google+, my personal profile.

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:01.230
So this ID you can either get
by looking at the page and

00:08:01.230 --> 00:08:02.920
copying it out of the URL.

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:08.430
Or you can access
it using the API

00:08:08.430 --> 00:08:10.850
Explorer to get the profile.

00:08:10.850 --> 00:08:12.960
There's a lot of ways to get it,
which is also covered in

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:15.331
another video that I'll link
to in the show notes.

00:08:15.331 --> 00:08:19.020
But, once we have both of these
values in, we're pretty

00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:21.787
much wired up in terms of the
content that we have to add to

00:08:21.787 --> 00:08:24.180
the HTML file.

00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:26.500
This is a good starting
point for where

00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:28.660
we're going to be going.

00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:32.990
So switching over to the
plug-in, you see the name we

00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:35.320
chose in the HTML files
coincidentally matches the

00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:39.549
name of our plug-in, so it's
going to be called--

00:08:39.549 --> 00:08:42.700
and let's just dive into
the doStuff part.

00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:45.730
So does doStuff mean
for this plug-in?

00:08:45.730 --> 00:08:48.930
There's a few different things
we're going to be doing.

00:08:48.930 --> 00:08:52.300
The first thing we're going
to be doing is--

00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:54.140
pull out my notes--

00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:57.850
we're going to be creating
a new JavaScript client.

00:08:57.850 --> 00:08:59.100
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

00:09:03.390 --> 00:09:04.850
So we'll create a JavaScript
client.

00:09:04.850 --> 00:09:07.640
We'll tell it what APIs are
going to be calling.

00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:10.420
We'll set all the configuration
for it.

00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:16.350
Then we're going to be fetching
our activity.

00:09:16.350 --> 00:09:18.160
And finally we'll be rendering
it into the page.

00:09:21.530 --> 00:09:23.530
Seems pretty straightforward,
and it will be.

00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:32.250
So, first, let's create
our JavaScript client.

00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:35.460
This is where we're going to be
invoking the sample that I

00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:38.980
copied from the wiki page.

00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:40.550
Reading through this sample,
it's pretty short.

00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:42.950
It's only 30 lines of code.

00:09:42.950 --> 00:09:45.590
We can see that it already
shows us how to create a

00:09:45.590 --> 00:09:48.760
client library during
the load function.

00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:53.270
So gapi.client.load is
what we need to run.

00:09:53.270 --> 00:09:56.060
So let's just copy that fix
it into our plug-in.

00:09:58.610 --> 00:10:01.820
The only differences are, our
API key is coming from the

00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:07.860
settings that were passed into
the plug-in when we call it

00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:09.840
settings at API key.

00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:11.770
And we're calling
a different API.

00:10:11.770 --> 00:10:14.590
The sample from the wiki page
uses the URL shortener.

00:10:14.590 --> 00:10:15.840
We're going to be calling
the Plus API.

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:22.410
And it calls a makeRequest
function.

00:10:22.410 --> 00:10:23.940
We can just put a function
in line here.

00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:29.150
So now what will happen is, we
set our API key and we have a

00:10:29.150 --> 00:10:31.300
client library all set up.

00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:32.870
Oops.

00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:35.882
Let's now, from within this
function we'll fetch the

00:10:35.882 --> 00:10:38.055
activity, and then render
it into our page.

00:10:41.850 --> 00:10:44.456
So it's not out activity,
it's our activity.

00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:50.400
So we now need to learn, now
that we have a client library

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:53.870
created, we need to actually get
the data, make the call.

00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:56.790
Let's lean back on our sample
again to see how it did it.

00:10:56.790 --> 00:10:57.865
It ran this makeRequest
function,

00:10:57.865 --> 00:10:59.690
which is right up here.

00:11:02.450 --> 00:11:04.710
And you can see that it creates
a request object and

00:11:04.710 --> 00:11:05.980
then executes it.

00:11:05.980 --> 00:11:11.430
Create a new request
object has the

00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:12.320
method description here.

00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:17.040
So it's using the URL shortener
to do a url.get.

00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:18.870
We can copy this and
modify it too.

00:11:18.870 --> 00:11:24.870
So we'll just copy this out,
paste it in here, and modify

00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:28.160
it to fit our needs.

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:32.170
So we're going to be doing
plus, or actually

00:11:32.170 --> 00:11:41.720
client.plus.activities.list. And
you're probably wondering

00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:44.130
how I knew those names
for this function.

00:11:47.730 --> 00:11:50.120
These are the names of the
functions for the REST APIs,

00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:52.150
so you can either go to the
reference docs to look them

00:11:52.150 --> 00:11:55.800
up, or I usually use the API
Explorer Which I'll link in

00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:56.730
the show notes.

00:11:56.730 --> 00:11:58.850
The identifiers and the API
Explorer, the names of the

00:11:58.850 --> 00:12:01.430
methods and the names
of the APIs,

00:12:01.430 --> 00:12:02.810
actually match these exactly.

00:12:02.810 --> 00:12:05.430
So you can copy and paste right
into here, which is what

00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:08.780
I did while I was
developing it.

00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:11.510
So now that we've created
a rest request that gets

00:12:11.510 --> 00:12:14.270
activities, or that lists our
activities, we need to pass in

00:12:14.270 --> 00:12:19.450
those two critical parameters
at the very least. So let's

00:12:19.450 --> 00:12:21.740
pass in our API key.

00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:26.610
Or actually, the key, we already
configured above.

00:12:26.610 --> 00:12:28.570
We need to pass in our userId.

00:12:28.570 --> 00:12:30.018
Sorry.

00:12:30.018 --> 00:12:31.440
Here we go.

00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:35.630
And that's also going to come
from the settings because we

00:12:35.630 --> 00:12:38.300
passed it in when we created
the plug-in, or when we

00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:39.880
invoked the plug-in from
our HTML file.

00:12:43.050 --> 00:12:44.840
There are a couple other
required parameters, which you

00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:47.050
can see from the reference docs,
or from-- or actually,

00:12:47.050 --> 00:12:48.250
there is one other required
parameter.

00:12:48.250 --> 00:12:49.730
As you can see from the
reference docs, or the API

00:12:49.730 --> 00:12:58.370
Explorer, we need to specify a
collection, which is a string.

00:12:58.370 --> 00:13:03.280
And there's only one valid
option, which is "Public." And

00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:05.300
we should probably also specify
one of the optional

00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:06.130
parameters.

00:13:06.130 --> 00:13:08.650
By default this API returns 10
activities, which could take

00:13:08.650 --> 00:13:10.330
up a lot of space.

00:13:10.330 --> 00:13:15.060
So let's specify max
results value.

00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:17.250
And let's do 5 for now.

00:13:22.450 --> 00:13:24.670
So now that we've created our
request with all of the

00:13:24.670 --> 00:13:27.420
required parameters, and one
of the optional parameters,

00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:28.670
we'll execute it.

00:13:31.030 --> 00:13:32.850
And the function in the
sample, they just

00:13:32.850 --> 00:13:34.010
appended the results.

00:13:34.010 --> 00:13:36.090
So that's where we'll be doing
our rendering stuff.

00:13:39.854 --> 00:13:42.420
But we don't need to call an
appendResults function, which

00:13:42.420 --> 00:13:44.080
is the function defined
in that sample.

00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:46.700
We'll just put the
rendering here.

00:13:53.170 --> 00:13:58.690
So, at this step, what I'll
usually do is log the response

00:13:58.690 --> 00:14:02.660
object and take a look at what
the response object looks like

00:14:02.660 --> 00:14:07.510
in debugging tools like the
Chrome debug tools or Firebug

00:14:07.510 --> 00:14:08.660
or something like that.

00:14:08.660 --> 00:14:12.510
And it's just an object that
contains a bunch of attributes

00:14:12.510 --> 00:14:14.610
about the activities.

00:14:14.610 --> 00:14:16.660
So, I'll usually kind of click
around to see what kind of

00:14:16.660 --> 00:14:20.200
information I want, where it
exists in that big old object,

00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:25.590
and then just do regular
HTML creation.

00:14:25.590 --> 00:14:27.880
So rather than walk you through
all of that stuff,

00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:31.000
which is pretty standard jQuery,
I'm going to grab a

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.080
copy of it.

00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:36.770
And here we go.

00:14:36.770 --> 00:14:40.360
jQuery-ized, a jQuery way of
creating a HTML element.

00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:43.510
So what we're doing is, we're
taking that response object,

00:14:43.510 --> 00:14:46.230
we're grabbing the items out of
it, which is a list of all

00:14:46.230 --> 00:14:49.390
the activities in
that response.

00:14:49.390 --> 00:14:52.270
And then we're taking-- we're
iterating through those

00:14:52.270 --> 00:14:55.890
activities in the items list,
and we're pulling some

00:14:55.890 --> 00:14:56.628
information out of it.

00:14:56.628 --> 00:14:59.790
We're pulling the publish date,
the URL of the activity

00:14:59.790 --> 00:15:03.990
on Google+, and the
content itself.

00:15:03.990 --> 00:15:08.130
The object.content, which is the
full text of the activity.

00:15:08.130 --> 00:15:13.740
And then we're creating an
unordered list that contains

00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:16.920
the time stamp and then all
of the activity contents.

00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:19.730
Then we take it and we appended
to this, which is

00:15:19.730 --> 00:15:23.460
going to be inserting it inside
of the HTML element the

00:15:23.460 --> 00:15:25.755
jQuery was called in, in this
case, our activities.

00:15:29.390 --> 00:15:32.726
So that is all the
code, actually.

00:15:32.726 --> 00:15:34.245
And we can see it in action.

00:15:38.330 --> 00:15:39.630
You pull it up in
a web browser.

00:15:39.630 --> 00:15:41.180
I'm going to switch back to my
camera for a while, while I

00:15:41.180 --> 00:15:45.280
futz around with
screen sharing.

00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:46.090
And there we go.

00:15:46.090 --> 00:15:51.460
This is my activity loaded
from that plug-in.

00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:57.220
Pretty cool, isn't it?

00:15:57.220 --> 00:15:58.700
And if you're actually including
this in your web

00:15:58.700 --> 00:16:00.480
page, there's probably a
bunch of other stuff

00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:01.730
you'll want to do.

00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:05.040
Pull my screen sharing.

00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:05.720
Probably some other stuff
you'll want to do.

00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:08.640
You'll probably want to do some
additional formatting on

00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:10.360
the content that you're
rendering on your web page.

00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:13.400
You probably don't want the
whole activity to be posted.

00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:16.130
Or maybe you want to include
information about whether it

00:16:16.130 --> 00:16:18.480
was a reshare, or if there was
an image attached, you may

00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:22.550
want to render that image
within this widget.

00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:25.250
That all kind of comes down to
the details of that last

00:16:25.250 --> 00:16:26.790
section of the plug-in.

00:16:26.790 --> 00:16:28.260
But it's really just
that simple.

00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:32.120
And under 100 lines of code, and
we have a starting point

00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:34.550
for implementing your way to--

00:16:34.550 --> 00:16:37.480
to include your content on any
external web page, which is a

00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:42.070
great way to show people where
you're active on the internet.

00:16:42.070 --> 00:16:43.210
Cool, OK.

00:16:43.210 --> 00:16:47.440
So the code for that is already
up [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:47.860
control.

00:16:47.860 --> 00:16:51.070
I'll be linking to it
from the show notes.

00:16:51.070 --> 00:16:52.735
So, you'll be able to go in
there and grab the code.

00:16:52.735 --> 00:16:55.950
And especially when it's on air,
sometimes it's kind of

00:16:55.950 --> 00:16:58.250
hard to see the signing window,
the text doesn't

00:16:58.250 --> 00:16:59.660
render quite great.

00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:01.910
So you'll be able to walk
through the code yourself.

00:17:01.910 --> 00:17:04.079
You'll be able to drop a running
version into your

00:17:04.079 --> 00:17:08.089
pages, and play with it and
all that cool stuff.

00:17:08.089 --> 00:17:12.460
So, hope you have
fun with that.

00:17:12.460 --> 00:17:15.569
So now that live coding is
through, let's answer some of

00:17:15.569 --> 00:17:17.140
your questions.

00:17:17.140 --> 00:17:21.089
So I'm going to pull up the page
and take a look at what

00:17:21.089 --> 00:17:24.720
you guys have been discussing
well I've been yammering over

00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:27.510
here about my code.

00:17:27.510 --> 00:17:28.180
Cool.

00:17:28.180 --> 00:17:29.590
Well, you had asked some
great questions

00:17:29.590 --> 00:17:31.650
before the hangout started.

00:17:31.650 --> 00:17:35.740
I'm going to start by answering
some of these.

00:17:35.740 --> 00:17:40.000
So Jeffrey asked, are there
beta testing abilities for

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.790
account holders, including
business who have pages?

00:17:43.790 --> 00:17:44.930
This is a great question.

00:17:44.930 --> 00:17:48.590
It's always cool to stay ahead
of the curve, especially if

00:17:48.590 --> 00:17:51.300
you are a publisher who has
included our publisher

00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:55.790
widgets, our publisher plug-ins,
on your web pages.

00:17:55.790 --> 00:17:59.450
For example, the +1 button
or the badge.

00:17:59.450 --> 00:18:01.870
It's really important that
you stay a little bit

00:18:01.870 --> 00:18:02.650
ahead of the curve.

00:18:02.650 --> 00:18:06.700
And we actually have a program
specifically for the publisher

00:18:06.700 --> 00:18:10.090
features for the plug-ins that
enable you to do this.

00:18:10.090 --> 00:18:12.930
So what you can do is, there's
a form you can go to today.

00:18:12.930 --> 00:18:15.360
You punch in your Google
account, or your Gmail

00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:18.410
account, and then whenever
we're about to push new

00:18:18.410 --> 00:18:23.100
features for the plug-ins,
you'll see them early, either

00:18:23.100 --> 00:18:25.230
a few days early for small
changes, or maybe a couple

00:18:25.230 --> 00:18:28.100
weeks early for larger changes
or new releases.

00:18:28.100 --> 00:18:29.990
You'll see them when you're
logged into that account in

00:18:29.990 --> 00:18:32.830
the new version, which allows
you to adjust all of your web

00:18:32.830 --> 00:18:34.920
designs, potentially,
to new color schemes

00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:36.660
and things like that.

00:18:36.660 --> 00:18:38.520
We definitely listen to all the
feedback that comes from

00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:41.900
that program, so I will share
that in the show notes.

00:18:41.900 --> 00:18:43.890
But that is just for
the plug-ins.

00:18:43.890 --> 00:18:47.990
We don't really have any beta
programs for other features of

00:18:47.990 --> 00:18:51.080
the platform right now.

00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:53.920
It's always something
we're investigating.

00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:56.760
But I'll put a link to the
sign-up form for the publisher

00:18:56.760 --> 00:18:59.470
preview in the show notes.

00:18:59.470 --> 00:19:00.720
Thanks.

00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:08.110
So, Hector asked, any news
on when the API will be

00:19:08.110 --> 00:19:10.460
available, or when more desktop
features are coming to

00:19:10.460 --> 00:19:13.780
mobile, like URL summaries
and image previews.

00:19:13.780 --> 00:19:16.070
I have great news for you.

00:19:16.070 --> 00:19:17.430
We have APIs already.

00:19:17.430 --> 00:19:20.800
In fact, I just showed you
how to use some of them.

00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:23.950
And the APIs are a lot more
broad then the REST APIs that

00:19:23.950 --> 00:19:25.130
I just showed you.

00:19:25.130 --> 00:19:27.420
In addition to the REST APIs,
which give you access to

00:19:27.420 --> 00:19:31.430
public data on Google+, such
as posts, profiles, and

00:19:31.430 --> 00:19:34.420
comments, you also have some
other really cool features.

00:19:34.420 --> 00:19:36.830
We have the social plug-ins
that allow you to insert--

00:19:36.830 --> 00:19:41.450
to link up your external sites
to Google+ via the +1 button

00:19:41.450 --> 00:19:45.135
to enable sharing, via the
badge, so people know about

00:19:45.135 --> 00:19:47.180
your presence on Google+.

00:19:47.180 --> 00:19:48.930
Those are pretty powerful.

00:19:48.930 --> 00:19:51.580
But my favorite right now, the
most important part in my

00:19:51.580 --> 00:19:57.100
opinion, is the hangout apps,
which are a great way to write

00:19:57.100 --> 00:19:59.515
interactive programs that run
within a hangout like the

00:19:59.515 --> 00:20:00.990
hangout we're doing right now.

00:20:00.990 --> 00:20:02.060
And they're a ton of fun.

00:20:02.060 --> 00:20:03.910
There's a lot of really cool
stuff you can write.

00:20:03.910 --> 00:20:05.700
And there's a lot of cool
apps out there already.

00:20:10.990 --> 00:20:13.610
So, moving on.

00:20:13.610 --> 00:20:18.260
Stephen asks about moderation
features in hangouts.

00:20:18.260 --> 00:20:19.370
We're using hangouts
right now.

00:20:19.370 --> 00:20:22.880
I'm definitely a big hangout
user, so I totally understand

00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:25.790
why you want more moderation
features, especially if you're

00:20:25.790 --> 00:20:29.300
using hangouts for things that
are beyond just a regular

00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:31.070
informal meeting between
friends.

00:20:31.070 --> 00:20:33.790
When you're using them for more
sophisticated purposes,

00:20:33.790 --> 00:20:36.320
it will be really cool to have
moderation controls to be able

00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:39.430
to kind of manage a hangout,
maybe schedule one ahead of

00:20:39.430 --> 00:20:41.250
time, all that kind of stuff.

00:20:41.250 --> 00:20:43.330
This is great feedback.

00:20:43.330 --> 00:20:45.140
Unfortunately, this is probably
something we're not

00:20:45.140 --> 00:20:49.100
going to implement initially as
a feature of the platform.

00:20:49.100 --> 00:20:51.050
So I can't really talk to
it in a lot of detail.

00:20:51.050 --> 00:20:52.590
It's something that we're going
to have to implement as

00:20:52.590 --> 00:20:54.270
a core feature first.

00:20:54.270 --> 00:20:59.030
So like all of the Google+
recommendations I get, I'd

00:20:59.030 --> 00:21:01.410
like to ask you to please
do me a favor.

00:21:01.410 --> 00:21:03.925
There's a send feedback link in
the lower corner of the web

00:21:03.925 --> 00:21:06.140
page, depending on which
language you're in.

00:21:06.140 --> 00:21:08.540
It's either the right
or left corner.

00:21:08.540 --> 00:21:10.575
So click on the send feedback
link and send

00:21:10.575 --> 00:21:12.540
this feedback to us.

00:21:12.540 --> 00:21:13.780
We listen to this feedback.

00:21:13.780 --> 00:21:15.900
It automatically gets routed
to the right team.

00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:17.730
It may get aggregated.

00:21:17.730 --> 00:21:20.990
But people are definitely
listening to the feedback.

00:21:20.990 --> 00:21:24.950
And you may not get a response,
but someone's

00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:25.540
definitely listening.

00:21:25.540 --> 00:21:28.700
So please send details about
what kind of moderation

00:21:28.700 --> 00:21:30.810
features you'd like to see
in hangouts via the

00:21:30.810 --> 00:21:31.972
send feedback tool.

00:21:31.972 --> 00:21:34.610
I'd really appreciate that.

00:21:34.610 --> 00:21:35.860
Thanks.

00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:43.690
And Danny asks, when can I have
hangouts on air, the very

00:21:43.690 --> 00:21:45.340
feature you're watching
me on right now.

00:21:45.340 --> 00:21:48.980
So hangouts on air is not ready
for prime time yet.

00:21:48.980 --> 00:21:52.990
We're still in a testing phase,
and it's a big feature.

00:21:52.990 --> 00:21:55.470
So we're taking our time to make
sure it's really polished

00:21:55.470 --> 00:21:58.470
before we pass it out
to everyone else.

00:21:58.470 --> 00:21:59.670
So please hang tight.

00:21:59.670 --> 00:22:01.650
I don't really have a lot.

00:22:01.650 --> 00:22:03.740
I don't know when it will be
available, and don't know when

00:22:03.740 --> 00:22:05.190
we can roll it out
to more people.

00:22:05.190 --> 00:22:07.470
But hang tight right now.

00:22:07.470 --> 00:22:10.140
Keep an eye on the
Google+ blog.

00:22:10.140 --> 00:22:13.500
When it's ready, you'll
definitely see news there.

00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:16.060
And then you'll be
able to dig in.

00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:22.212
Next stop is Fergin.

00:22:22.212 --> 00:22:22.570
Fergin--

00:22:22.570 --> 00:22:24.110
I hope I got your name right.

00:22:24.110 --> 00:22:25.870
Hi Fergin.

00:22:25.870 --> 00:22:28.550
We talked a little bit
last week too.

00:22:28.550 --> 00:22:31.070
You mentioned that you were
having an issue where the

00:22:31.070 --> 00:22:34.900
numbers on Google Analytics,
Google Webmaster Tools, and

00:22:34.900 --> 00:22:38.710
your +1 button that describe
your social interactions were

00:22:38.710 --> 00:22:44.030
a little bit out of sync,
or a lot out of sync.

00:22:44.030 --> 00:22:45.780
We're still investigating
this.

00:22:45.780 --> 00:22:48.760
And as you've noticed, the
count's gone up on the +1

00:22:48.760 --> 00:22:50.460
button on your web page,
so we're continuing to

00:22:50.460 --> 00:22:52.940
investigate this.

00:22:52.940 --> 00:22:55.780
And I don't have a final answer
yet, which is why I

00:22:55.780 --> 00:22:58.550
haven't responded to the issue
that you filed on the issue

00:22:58.550 --> 00:23:01.280
tracker, which you mentioned
in your comment.

00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:04.960
But I do have a little bit I can
tell you about, what we're

00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:07.710
digging around in there
and finding.

00:23:07.710 --> 00:23:10.030
Google Analytics takes a little
bit of a different

00:23:10.030 --> 00:23:12.930
approach to social tracking then
Webmaster Tools and the

00:23:12.930 --> 00:23:15.630
+1 button count itself.

00:23:15.630 --> 00:23:18.550
Webmaster Tools and +1 button
count, the count on the button

00:23:18.550 --> 00:23:21.360
itself, are really focused
on the +1 button.

00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:26.190
So they're able to keep track
of when someone unclicks the

00:23:26.190 --> 00:23:31.210
+1 button, or when a +1 is
excluded for some reason.

00:23:31.210 --> 00:23:34.040
Google Analytics, on the other
hand, is a much more generic

00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:37.270
social tracking tool.

00:23:37.270 --> 00:23:39.520
It tracks +1s out of the box,
but you can pretty easily

00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:41.830
configure it to track tweets,
you can configure track

00:23:41.830 --> 00:23:44.540
Facebook likes, and pretty
much any other social

00:23:44.540 --> 00:23:47.745
interaction via the JavaScript
hooks they provide.

00:23:47.745 --> 00:23:50.850
And this is really powerful, but
as a result of it being a

00:23:50.850 --> 00:23:57.590
very generic feature, it has a
little bit less insight into

00:23:57.590 --> 00:23:58.720
exactly what it's tracking.

00:23:58.720 --> 00:24:00.650
The gist of it is,
it tracks social

00:24:00.650 --> 00:24:03.330
activities, and not +1s.

00:24:03.330 --> 00:24:06.720
So, someone comes and un +1s a
page, Google Analytics isn't

00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:09.030
going to reduce that count.

00:24:09.030 --> 00:24:12.210
It only counts up because it's
a record of all the social

00:24:12.210 --> 00:24:14.760
activities that have happened
historically.

00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:17.340
So that's why Google Analytics
is usually going to register a

00:24:17.340 --> 00:24:19.460
little bit higher, and
there is a bigger

00:24:19.460 --> 00:24:20.360
discrepancy on your page.

00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:23.720
So we're still investigating,
but I will respond to the

00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:25.170
issue once we have
a final answer.

00:24:25.170 --> 00:24:28.420
But I thought you would
appreciate an update, since

00:24:28.420 --> 00:24:31.800
you were nice enough to
keep us up-to-date.

00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:32.990
So, thanks a lot.

00:24:32.990 --> 00:24:36.000
And that's all the questions I
saw that were posted before,

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:39.720
so bear with me as I dig through
the comments that have

00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:40.970
been asked during the show.

00:24:47.510 --> 00:24:49.580
So there's some questions
about the new

00:24:49.580 --> 00:24:51.060
Google+ user interface.

00:24:51.060 --> 00:24:53.140
It's still rolling out.

00:24:53.140 --> 00:24:54.030
It's pretty cool.

00:24:54.030 --> 00:24:56.420
I like it a lot.

00:24:56.420 --> 00:24:58.940
And it's still rolling
out across, so you

00:24:58.940 --> 00:24:59.900
may not see it yet.

00:24:59.900 --> 00:25:02.530
Just hang tight, it'll
be there soon.

00:25:02.530 --> 00:25:04.850
As with all of our releases,
a lot of these things go

00:25:04.850 --> 00:25:08.550
gradually just because we want
to make sure it's rolling out

00:25:08.550 --> 00:25:10.290
well before we keep pushing
it to everyone.

00:25:12.980 --> 00:25:18.250
Michael Tucker mentions that it
can be a little tricky to

00:25:18.250 --> 00:25:22.720
run a chat during a hang out,
and it can help to have an

00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:24.680
extra person doing
production work.

00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:26.280
And that's actually what
we're doing right now.

00:25:26.280 --> 00:25:30.560
Julia is back in the camera
right now, making sure that my

00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:32.860
audio levels are appropriate
and all that stuff.

00:25:32.860 --> 00:25:34.660
And that's actually really
good advice.

00:25:34.660 --> 00:25:37.390
If you're running hangout on
air, or if you're just doing

00:25:37.390 --> 00:25:40.020
[? hyperfail ?] hangout at all
It helps to have someone who's

00:25:40.020 --> 00:25:43.780
not on camera who is managing
and making sure all the data

00:25:43.780 --> 00:25:46.850
flows right, and that the sound
levels are all good, and

00:25:46.850 --> 00:25:48.050
can shoot a Nerf dart
at you when

00:25:48.050 --> 00:25:49.890
you're talking too quietly.

00:25:49.890 --> 00:25:51.050
So great advice.

00:25:51.050 --> 00:25:54.950
We've learned that too,
and it helps so much.

00:25:54.950 --> 00:25:56.395
Danny, you asked why
you couldn't join

00:25:56.395 --> 00:25:58.560
the hangout at 11:30.

00:25:58.560 --> 00:26:01.350
Because of the nature of the
hangout on air, we keep it a

00:26:01.350 --> 00:26:03.530
little bit more limited
audience, just to make sure

00:26:03.530 --> 00:26:05.690
that we can keep it focused.

00:26:05.690 --> 00:26:08.800
But I definitely like to open
up these hangouts to

00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:09.300
developers.

00:26:09.300 --> 00:26:14.200
So if you have a question, when
you ask it on the thread,

00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:17.020
just mention that you'd like
to ask it in person.

00:26:17.020 --> 00:26:20.240
And then what will happen is,
we'll loop back with you, and

00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:24.160
we'll communicate and arrange
all of the timing and stuff,

00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:25.890
so you can join the
hangout in person.

00:26:25.890 --> 00:26:27.670
And that goes for all
of you out there.

00:26:27.670 --> 00:26:30.060
So if any of you has something
you'd like to discuss, on the

00:26:30.060 --> 00:26:33.700
hangout on air, just ping us
ahead of time, whoever created

00:26:33.700 --> 00:26:35.410
the hangout announcement.

00:26:35.410 --> 00:26:39.800
And we'll talk to you, and see
if we can get you in here.

00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:42.690
Because we always like talking
to developers in person via

00:26:42.690 --> 00:26:43.250
the hangout.

00:26:43.250 --> 00:26:44.500
It's so much better.

00:26:47.170 --> 00:26:51.900
So there's a great question
in there from Fabio.

00:26:51.900 --> 00:26:55.590
Hi, is it possible, when using
the activity search method,

00:26:55.590 --> 00:26:58.980
for example, querying for a very
specific hashtag, to only

00:26:58.980 --> 00:27:02.420
get the activities created
after a previous search?

00:27:02.420 --> 00:27:04.510
So it sounds like you're trying
to build a continuous

00:27:04.510 --> 00:27:09.340
feed of activities for
a specific hashtag.

00:27:09.340 --> 00:27:12.850
Right now there's no way
to filter by date.

00:27:12.850 --> 00:27:14.870
It's something that would
be really powerful for

00:27:14.870 --> 00:27:17.240
implementing this
kind of feature.

00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:20.770
For now, you're going to have
to do a little bit more work

00:27:20.770 --> 00:27:21.530
on your side.

00:27:21.530 --> 00:27:23.460
So when I've tried to implement
this stuff in the

00:27:23.460 --> 00:27:26.510
past, I've just had to keep
track of the activities that

00:27:26.510 --> 00:27:29.640
I've already seen, and just keep
paging past until I think

00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:31.300
I've gotten most of them.

00:27:31.300 --> 00:27:33.300
So it's a little bit fuzzy, and
there is the possibility

00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:35.770
you're going to miss some.

00:27:35.770 --> 00:27:38.440
But you can implement
this functionality.

00:27:38.440 --> 00:27:42.020
And the way I've done once is,
I would page through a few

00:27:42.020 --> 00:27:46.460
times every time I hit the API,
and then I would take the

00:27:46.460 --> 00:27:49.220
activities that I've already
seen and stick them into a

00:27:49.220 --> 00:27:52.240
bloom filter or a cache
of some kind.

00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:54.510
Then, when I do the fetch
again, I take all the

00:27:54.510 --> 00:27:57.850
activities that I grabbed,
compare them against that, and

00:27:57.850 --> 00:28:02.550
then display them as output
from the application.

00:28:02.550 --> 00:28:05.495
And this has the added benefit
of, if they've been updated, I

00:28:05.495 --> 00:28:06.950
would display the updated
version too,

00:28:06.950 --> 00:28:08.490
which is kind of cool.

00:28:08.490 --> 00:28:09.380
So it can be implemented.

00:28:09.380 --> 00:28:12.640
It requires a little extra
work on your side, and we

00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:15.210
understand that adding that
filter would make it better.

00:28:15.210 --> 00:28:17.720
So we'll look into doing that.

00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:18.970
Thanks for the feedback.

00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:22.880
Okey doke.

00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:24.860
So I guess we're going to be
wrapping it up a couple

00:28:24.860 --> 00:28:26.000
minutes early today.

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:28.350
Thanks for joining me
for the live coding.

00:28:28.350 --> 00:28:29.890
And I have one quick
announcement to

00:28:29.890 --> 00:28:33.070
make before we finish.

00:28:33.070 --> 00:28:34.860
Up until now, we've been pretty
good about doing these

00:28:34.860 --> 00:28:37.840
hangouts, these office
hours, every week.

00:28:37.840 --> 00:28:39.350
We're actually going to be
cutting back a little bit,

00:28:39.350 --> 00:28:42.190
starting sometime
in a few weeks.

00:28:42.190 --> 00:28:44.520
So we'll be back next week, but
after that, we're probably

00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:48.050
going to reduce our schedule to
about every other week or

00:28:48.050 --> 00:28:50.770
twice a month.

00:28:50.770 --> 00:28:53.510
We were doing this too, so that
we can produce smaller

00:28:53.510 --> 00:28:55.250
amount but a higher quality
in content.

00:28:55.250 --> 00:28:57.180
So we're going to focus a little
bit more time on what

00:28:57.180 --> 00:29:01.560
we we're presenting, and make
sure it's always great.

00:29:01.560 --> 00:29:04.030
And in the weeks we're not on
air, you can still reach us

00:29:04.030 --> 00:29:06.840
via stack overflow,
our support forum,

00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:08.780
our + page or yeah--

00:29:08.780 --> 00:29:10.430
all of the existing channels.

00:29:10.430 --> 00:29:11.870
We're still around.

00:29:11.870 --> 00:29:16.320
We just won't be on air
quite as often.

00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:17.800
That's all we have for today.

00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:19.890
Thanks so much for watching.

00:29:19.890 --> 00:29:23.620
And I'll see you guys all on
the forums and the + page.

00:29:23.620 --> 00:29:24.870
Bye everyone.
