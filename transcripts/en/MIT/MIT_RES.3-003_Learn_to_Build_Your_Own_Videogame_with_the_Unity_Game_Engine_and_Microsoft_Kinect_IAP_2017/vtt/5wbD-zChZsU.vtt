00:00:15.511 --> 00:00:19.900
STUDENT: OK so basically,
the premise or our game

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:24.581
is we're essentially trying to
knock people out of the way.

00:00:24.581 --> 00:00:26.080
They're coming
towards us and you're

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:28.270
moving as the first player.

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:33.600
And when they come too close
to you, they stick to you.

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.240
They stick to your screen.

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:37.600
[CLAPPING]

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.450
And you're trying
to move them out

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.910
of the way with your hand, which
is, right now, a cube object.

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:44.969
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.010
Because we couldn't find
any arms that were free.

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:52.400
STUDENT: And the functionality
isn't quite there yet.

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.210
We couldn't get the
gestures for it.

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.250
We were trying to
set up the game

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.980
and focus on colliders, because
that was giving us a hard time.

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:03.480
So I think that shouldn't
be too hard to implement

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:04.090
in the future.

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:06.550
But we can show you
what we have for now.

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:10.380
STUDENT: Oh, and yeah, we got to
this breakthrough in the past,

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:10.880
what?

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:11.380
20 minutes?

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:12.620
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:15.230
So one of that time that he
told us to [INAUDIBLE] computer,

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:18.370
we actually got
something to work.

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:20.800
So as of right now, it's
just kind of an animation

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.340
of things happening.

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.630
We haven't actually-- our mouse
moves, but doesn't do anything.

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:27.812
So it's just-- yeah.

00:01:27.812 --> 00:01:29.020
Should I do maximize on play?

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.825
Oh yeah.

00:01:31.825 --> 00:01:33.813
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:33.813 --> 00:01:34.727
There it goes.

00:01:34.727 --> 00:01:35.310
PROFESSOR: Oh.

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:35.755
Oh.

00:01:35.755 --> 00:01:36.200
STUDENT: Oh.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.699
Oh.

00:01:36.699 --> 00:01:38.480
Oh.

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:39.540
There we go.

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.300
And that's probably
the end of it.

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:45.170
But yeah, we got the
people to stick in here.

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:46.182
That's the best.

00:01:46.182 --> 00:01:48.150
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:53.650
And I think-- so
basically, how we

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:57.250
designed it is that
we had a cube object.

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:59.590
And we made that our trigger.

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:00.656
It's invisible.

00:02:00.656 --> 00:02:02.120
It's only made of mesh.

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.620
Whatever.

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:03.360
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.030
STUDENT: Yeah.

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:05.270
And we made it invisible.

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.259
And so that whenever
people collide onto it,

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:10.300
the object gets destroyed.

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.570
And we have stuff already
pretty bare, as you can see.

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:16.120
And it's inactive beforehand.

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.450
So once someone collides,
someone appears.

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.300
So it's like someone
has stuck to you,

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.130
but no, people are
just already there.

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:27.630
But they disappear.
