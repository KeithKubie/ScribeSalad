00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:02.540
- Each of your weapons will now
be put through a series

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:04.460
of three tests, there
will be a strength

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:08.500
test, a sharpness test, and
up first, the kill test.

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:09.040
Doug?

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:15.880
Blade smiths, to find out
what kind of lethal damage

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:18.000
your weapon will do, I
will take your rings,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.710
and for slashes and thrusts
on this big carcass.

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:21.880
Rebel, you're up first.

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:23.000
You ready?
- More than ready.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.380
Let's do this.

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:26.540
The amount of stress
in hitting that pig,

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:28.420
I'm afraid the rivets
may try to come loose.

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.250
[music playing]

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:41.710
[whacking]

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:53.040
(WHISPERING) Nice job.

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:59.710
All right.

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:00.830
I like the construction here.

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:02.000
It's unique.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.250
I've never seen
this done before.

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:05.210
It makes it very
sturdy, but it adds

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:06.790
a little more weight to it.

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:10.460
It makes siding it a
little bit more difficult.

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.790
But yet, once you get going,
your winning fire will kill.

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.620
- Thank you.
- All right, Chuck.

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:17.960
Your turn.
You ready?

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:19.960
I'm ready.

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.620
For me, the big
concern is the welds.

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:26.120
That's the weak point.

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:27.580
[music playing]

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:30.790
[whacking]

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:38.790
It ain't critical.

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.960
Just like that one broke,
any of the other ones

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.620
could possibly break,
which has me worried

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:47.670
that I really
screwed something up.

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.960
[whacking]

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:01.960
First up, it's obvious.

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.000
The problem here is
you lost the blade.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.750
With the welds that you
have here, it broke.

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.120
That's why you have other blades
to help out with the fight.

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:12.670
Your blades are wicked sharp.

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.000
Because they're so
much lighter, the cuts

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.500
are deeper and sharper.

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.500
It will kill.

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.000
Next stop, the strength test.
Dave?

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.960
Now, to test the strength
and overall construction

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:31.460
of your wind and fire
rings, I'll be attacking

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:33.170
our bamboo woosh dummie.

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.000
Rebel, you're up first.
You ready?

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.960
Definitely.

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.290
[music playing]

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:52.040
[whacking]

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:59.500
Damn.

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:06.540
OK.

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.830
So right off, Rebel,
those points are wicked.

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:11.420
They are nice and
sharp and strong.

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:13.920
There's a lot of
weight to these blades.

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.920
But I think your construction
technique is brilliant.

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:17.750
Nicely done.

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:18.880
Thank you.

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:20.040
All right, Chuck.

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.500
You ready?
- Yeah.

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:22.580
OK

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:25.040
[music playing]

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.330
[whacking]

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:45.330
So Chuck, we have
lost another one.

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:46.710
They feel good.

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:48.540
They're light, they're
fast, they're sharp.

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.250
But they're coming apart.

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:53.710
So Chuck, the bottom line
is, with this kind of damage,

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:56.290
I can't safely
continue to test these.

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:56.960
I understand.

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:58.750
All right.

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:01.790
Chuck, now we have a vote of
no confidence from the judges

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:03.790
to move forward in this testing.

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:05.790
And for that reason,
I have to ask

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:09.710
you to please leave the forge.
- Thanks.

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:11.880
You put on a good fight.

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:13.750
I don't mind losing to Rebel.

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:16.210
He came up with a
brilliant design.

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:19.210
I may not have won, but I always
figured if I can get a good

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:22.120
it'll kill out of Dough, I won.

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:23.290
And I did.

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:26.290
And I'm pretty
excited about that.
