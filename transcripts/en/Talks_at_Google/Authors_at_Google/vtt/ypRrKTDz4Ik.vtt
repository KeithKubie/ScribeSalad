ELISSA SHEVINSKY: Well, thank
you, [INAUDIBLE] for having me.

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:11.920
Thank you, Google,
for having me.

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:13.790
Thank you for coming.

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:16.510
"Lean Out," as I said,
our official pub date

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:18.390
is September 3.

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.750
So this is really
getting an early start.

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.240
And I think it's kind
of rad that Google

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:29.430
had me here considering
what the book is about.

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:34.020
So I've called this conversation
"Lean Out, Google, Lean Out!"

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.950
And here's my information.

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:39.840
I'm extremely friendly, as Josh
and [INAUDIBLE] can attest to.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.820
They've known me since college.

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.080
And now you know me.

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.250
So feel free to stay in
touch with me on Twitter.

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:48.730
And this is a little about me.

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:52.190
I'm the editor of
this book "Lean Out."

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:55.700
And I'm also organizing
a security conference

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:56.790
in New York.

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:01.170
And I run a privacy company.

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.680
If you decide you
want more books,

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:07.200
they're on OrBooks or Amazon
or just yell at me on Twitter.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.680
So it's pretty rad that
you invited me here today

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.500
considering what
this book is about.

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.090
I told a friend that I was
invited and he said, well,

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.990
they haven't read your book--
[LAUGHS]-- implying, of course,

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:26.840
if you knew what I was doing,
you would not have me here.

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.480
But I actually think
that's not true.

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:34.360
I think it's a reflection
of what Google's about that

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.460
you're welcoming me in to
have this conversation.

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.600
So one of the chapters in
this book is Erica Joy.

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.160
She published this
first on Medium

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.900
and agreed to let
us republish it,

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.020
which I was very grateful for.

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.300
It's called "The Other
Side of Diversity,"

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:54.120
and it's about,
among other things,

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:59.150
her negative experiences
as a black woman at Google.

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:01.404
So that's real.

00:02:01.404 --> 00:02:02.570
That's a thing that happens.

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:06.110
But I'm optimistic
about Google, or shall

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:10.030
say Alphabet Inc.?
[LAUGHING] I see

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:11.630
a facepalm in the front row.

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:12.720
[LAUGHING]

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.750
I'm all for it.

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.180
I mean, this way they can
spin things out and avoid

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:17.590
lawsuits between divisions.

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:20.290
It's smart.

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.730
I was at the Lesbians Who Tech
event, and I saw Megan Smith.

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:29.630
And I just became such a
fan girl, not only for Smith

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:34.570
but for Google's efforts towards
gender inclusion and people

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:36.000
of color.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.030
Megan Smith is saying
here in this GIF

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.960
the importance of diversity,
that the problems we

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:49.460
face as humanity-- I mean
she's thinking really big.

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:52.740
But they're so big that we
need to activate everyone.

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:55.270
We need everyone involved,
because how else are we

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:59.160
going to solve the
world's deepest problems?

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.900
And here she was at
the helm at Google.

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:03.440
And she spoke at
the Lesbians Who

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.190
Tech event about
the efforts Google

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:09.720
had made to attract
and hire women.

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.430
And I believe that
she was very sincere.

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:16.790
So I know that within Google,
these efforts have been made

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:18.380
and that they're real.

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:23.990
And so I come here today all
friendly-like, not hostile.

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:28.210
Despite what's in
this book, I fully

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:30.640
appreciate that Google
is a really big company

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:34.760
and that you've brought in some
of the best thinkers on this

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:37.660
and that there are people
here who are trying hard.

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:41.170
And so that's the spirit that I
want to have this conversation

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:43.710
today, that we're all here.

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:45.220
We want to make this better.

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:47.130
We're going to
acknowledge what's wrong

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:51.160
and also acknowledge that Google
has a lot of potential to be

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.820
part of making things better.

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:59.190
So to start, first,
a lot of feminists

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:01.060
have me blocked on Twitter.

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:06.950
So I may be kind of a
surprising person for you today.

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:09.390
And I have doubts
about the efforts

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:13.190
to recruit women and
underrepresented groups.

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:19.410
That's because women, LGBTQ, and
people of color in my network

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:22.870
are struggling to be
funded and promoted

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:26.950
and report sometimes
shocking harassment.

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:29.970
So I worry about
bringing in new people

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:33.590
before we figured out
how to retain and advance

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:35.650
the people who are here.

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:38.750
At the same time, I
just turned Megan Smith

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:42.170
speak about how it's so urgent
that we bring in everyone.

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:44.700
And so all of these
things are here and real,

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:48.110
and it's really hard.

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:52.460
Part of what "Lean
Out" does is it

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:57.040
describes the shape of
the problem as many of us

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:58.140
experience it.

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:02.230
But it's really just a start.

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:05.880
I'm still figuring out what
the solution looks like.

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:09.250
And that's one reason why
we I'll want to open this up

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:12.370
pretty quickly into a
conversational format,

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:15.550
because I think a lot of
us are trying to figure out

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:17.720
what those solutions look like.

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:20.600
But kind of understanding
the shape of the problem

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:23.310
is a really good start.

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:30.650
So, recruitment-- a company
like Google doing recruitment

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:34.570
doesn't necessarily mean
hiring or promotion.

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:36.760
And this is all
the more true when

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:39.060
it's things like
teaching kindergartners

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:40.320
how to code, right?

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:44.870
Like all that does is increase
the possibility of applicants

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:47.190
that a company like
Google might bring in,

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:49.950
but it doesn't come
with any responsibility

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:53.840
to actually support,
fund, or promote

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:56.360
all of those people who
now know how to code.

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:58.160
It doesn't mean they're
going to get jobs

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:00.230
or they're going to get funded.

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:04.170
So that's one of
my reservations.

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:07.090
Being a qualified woman
does not necessarily

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:11.460
lead to being hired, promoted,
funded, or respected or treated

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:14.970
well once you land
somewhere, which

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:19.200
is part of the hard problem
that we're figuring out now.

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:21.280
Something else I'll
go into, because I'd

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:24.800
like to read a little
bit from "Lean Out,"

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:27.510
is that I love all the
additional opportunities

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:29.950
and resources that
are coming now

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:32.200
with recruitment
efforts for women,

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:35.100
but I just want to
take a lot of care

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:38.160
that we don't say that
women need special programs.

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:40.510
I've never felt that I
needed something special

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:43.460
to be interested in
tech, and I think

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:48.820
that's true for many women
and people of color and LGBTQ.

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:50.810
I'll focus
specifically on women,

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:55.520
but in "Lean Out"
in this preface now,

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:57.170
really we're
talking more broadly

00:06:57.170 --> 00:06:59.100
about all
underrepresented groups.

00:07:01.890 --> 00:07:04.410
I think it's not that women
need special programs.

00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:13.340
We just need respect and to
have-- well, I'll get into it.

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:17.510
To be very clear, women,
LGBTQ, and people of color

00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:20.470
are already here, and
we are already awesome.

00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:27.180
So if you'll indulge
me, I'm going

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:31.950
to read a little bit from
the chapter that I wrote

00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:36.420
and then open this up and
we'll see what you have to say

00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:38.800
and what your questions are.

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:40.950
That's good with everyone, yeah?

00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:43.250
OK, cool.

00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:46.860
My chapter is called "The
Pipeline isn't the Problem."

00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:49.090
"The pipeline problem,
a narrative that

00:07:49.090 --> 00:07:52.320
states that the reason big
tech companies have poor track

00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:55.190
records for hiring
and promoting women

00:07:55.190 --> 00:07:57.200
is because there
are too few women

00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:00.790
interested in or
skilled in STEM.

00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:03.780
The idea that tech has
a pipeline problem, one

00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:07.140
that can be solved by teaching
five-year-old girls to code,

00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:08.960
infuriates me.

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:11.100
It's awkward to say so.

00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:13.380
I need to tread
carefully here, lest I

00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:15.640
be accused of bad feminism.

00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:18.710
I can see the headline now--
'Lady Boss Against STEM

00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:24.130
Education for Girls, Also
Secretly Hates Puppies.'" I

00:08:24.130 --> 00:08:26.370
don't hate puppies,
but I'm allergic.

00:08:26.370 --> 00:08:28.620
So, you know.

00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:32.049
"I am, of course, in favor
of teaching girls to code.

00:08:32.049 --> 00:08:33.830
And it is true that
there are more men

00:08:33.830 --> 00:08:38.610
than women applying for jobs
and programs in Silicon Valley.

00:08:38.610 --> 00:08:41.590
But the reason why we don't
have more women in tech

00:08:41.590 --> 00:08:45.090
is not because of a
lack of STEM education.

00:08:45.090 --> 00:08:47.800
It's because too
many high profile

00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:51.860
and influential individuals
and subcultures within the tech

00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:55.340
industry have ignored or
outright mistreated women

00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:57.140
applicants and employees.

00:08:57.140 --> 00:09:00.220
To be succinct, the
problem isn't women.

00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:01.890
It's tech culture.

00:09:01.890 --> 00:09:05.100
That's the issue that
needs to be addressed.

00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:09.420
The work that I aim to do
here is clarifying the nature

00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:12.210
of the women-in-tech
problem to the extent

00:09:12.210 --> 00:09:14.990
that we agree
something is wrong.

00:09:14.990 --> 00:09:18.480
The women who work in tech
agree that the problem

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:23.170
is harassment, discrimination,
and a generally hostile work

00:09:23.170 --> 00:09:24.300
environment.

00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:27.240
Many site difficulties
being hired, promoted,

00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:28.870
or getting funding.

00:09:28.870 --> 00:09:32.010
An overwhelming number of the
highest profile technology

00:09:32.010 --> 00:09:34.500
companies have had
a sexual harassment

00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:39.410
scandal that has made headlines,
many within the last year.

00:09:39.410 --> 00:09:41.710
It is unsurprising
that these companies

00:09:41.710 --> 00:09:43.360
have difficulties hiring women.

00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:51.640
In 2012, I was told by a
senior manager at YouTube

00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:54.210
that I was not
qualified for Google."

00:09:54.210 --> 00:09:56.500
Some context here is
that I had actually

00:09:56.500 --> 00:10:03.060
been in tech since 1997, and I'd
had a lot of technology jobs.

00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:06.450
"I was told, Google
only hires the best."

00:10:06.450 --> 00:10:08.200
That's you guys.

00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:11.750
Despite spending many days
at YouTube and at Google,

00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:13.450
I was never recruited.

00:10:13.450 --> 00:10:16.660
I would go there to visit
my housemate, my friends,

00:10:16.660 --> 00:10:18.930
or to meet with
business contacts.

00:10:18.930 --> 00:10:22.910
I'd even lunch at the
YouTube HQ, Google Cambridge,

00:10:22.910 --> 00:10:24.710
and Google Mountain View.

00:10:24.710 --> 00:10:27.620
There was a time when I was
quite the Google fan girl.

00:10:27.620 --> 00:10:30.259
I would have loved to have
worked on Google+ back when

00:10:30.259 --> 00:10:31.675
the product will
still promising."

00:10:31.675 --> 00:10:34.080
[LAUGHING]

00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:36.910
"I am known for having a
lot of self-confidence.

00:10:36.910 --> 00:10:39.190
Claire Cain Miller of
"The New York Times"

00:10:39.190 --> 00:10:42.770
described me as having
entrepreneurial brio.

00:10:42.770 --> 00:10:45.380
I do not have a
confidence problem.

00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:47.550
But I definitely
integrated the idea

00:10:47.550 --> 00:10:50.320
that I would not
be hired at Google.

00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:53.300
In retrospect, I may
have had opportunities

00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:55.320
if I had fought for them.

00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:57.990
But Google is espousing the
idea that women are nowhere

00:10:57.990 --> 00:10:59.470
to be found.

00:10:59.470 --> 00:11:01.560
I was on campus
frequently and would

00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:03.870
have been an easy recruit.

00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:07.090
Google, and every
other big tech company,

00:11:07.090 --> 00:11:10.680
can't ask for much more than
for potential female hires

00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:14.100
to walk right onto campus,
as I did frequently

00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:17.240
in 2011 and 2012.

00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:19.175
I have brilliant
female friends who

00:11:19.175 --> 00:11:22.470
have applied for roles at
Google and other tech companies

00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:24.520
and have also been rejected.

00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:28.780
I am very curious
to understand why."

00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:30.180
Then I go on.

00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:33.110
"So let's stop saying
that women aren't here

00:11:33.110 --> 00:11:35.090
or that they aren't skilled.

00:11:35.090 --> 00:11:37.880
Let's instead look at
why we're not seeing,

00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:43.380
hiring, promoting, funding,
respecting the women who are.

00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:47.600
As [INAUDIBLE] tweeted at the
Lesbians Who Tech conference,

00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:51.700
'I believe the best way to hire
women and people of color is

00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:56.350
to higher them.' Sometimes I
think it really is that simple.

00:11:56.350 --> 00:11:59.960
The best way to hire more
women is to hire them.

00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:04.882
We're already here, and
we are already awesome."

00:12:04.882 --> 00:12:05.850
[APPLAUSE]

00:12:05.850 --> 00:12:08.820
Thank you.

00:12:08.820 --> 00:12:13.290
So I think that's enough
to open things up.

00:12:13.290 --> 00:12:17.000
Let's take questions
and take it from there.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:17.710
Can you hear me?

00:12:17.710 --> 00:12:20.449
I see [INAUDIBLE] getting a mic.

00:12:20.449 --> 00:12:20.990
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:23.250
I was hoping for
a clarification.

00:12:23.250 --> 00:12:24.626
You said that
we're already here,

00:12:24.626 --> 00:12:26.950
and we're already awesome.

00:12:26.950 --> 00:12:32.380
So one of the criticisms
was the big tech

00:12:32.380 --> 00:12:34.800
companies aren't hiring women
applicants who are already

00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:36.320
there.

00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:39.490
Is that because there's
an implicit bias?

00:12:39.490 --> 00:12:46.240
Is it because they're not sort
of choosing to hire more women?

00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:47.980
So what do you think
the root cause is?

00:12:47.980 --> 00:12:49.875
If there's women
who are here who

00:12:49.875 --> 00:12:52.910
are awesome who can be hired
and tech companies are at least

00:12:52.910 --> 00:12:54.650
saying they want
more women, where

00:12:54.650 --> 00:12:55.790
is the gap between the two?

00:12:55.790 --> 00:12:58.931
What is the cause of
them not being hired?

00:12:58.931 --> 00:13:00.680
ELISSA SHEVINSKY: I
think we're all trying

00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:02.820
to understand that right now.

00:13:02.820 --> 00:13:05.560
And I give Google
a lot of credit.

00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:09.880
It's my belief that many of
the upper management in Google

00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:12.030
are also working on this.

00:13:12.030 --> 00:13:16.080
So with that in mind,
I think some of it

00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:19.550
is not seeing the
potential applicants.

00:13:19.550 --> 00:13:21.190
I'll use myself as an example.

00:13:21.190 --> 00:13:27.080
I'm never recruited-- ever--
maybe like once every 60 days.

00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:29.240
And I'm fairly prominent.

00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:32.530
So companies are saying
they can't find women,

00:13:32.530 --> 00:13:36.290
but are they actually
really looking?

00:13:36.290 --> 00:13:37.830
So I think that's
the first part.

00:13:37.830 --> 00:13:40.620
Like women are here
in the ecosystem,

00:13:40.620 --> 00:13:43.320
but we're not
necessarily showing up

00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:46.160
where you're hoping to find us.

00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:48.710
For example, I'm part of
a Female Founders group.

00:13:48.710 --> 00:13:50.320
There are a ton of women there.

00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:52.200
Many of them would
probably be really

00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:55.640
happy to get a job at Google.

00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:57.600
Right now I'm pretty busy.

00:13:57.600 --> 00:13:58.940
I have this book out.

00:13:58.940 --> 00:13:59.980
I have a conference.

00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:01.130
I have a company.

00:14:01.130 --> 00:14:03.400
But six months ago,
that was not the case,

00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:05.510
and anyone could have hired me.

00:14:05.510 --> 00:14:07.250
And I begged my
friends to hire me

00:14:07.250 --> 00:14:09.080
as my startup was shutting down.

00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:12.240
And my friend hired
me, and that was great.

00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:17.810
But it goes to show
that we're here

00:14:17.810 --> 00:14:23.560
and we're not necessarily
being seen by the companies.

00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:25.310
AUDIENCE: I mean, one
thing I'll point out

00:14:25.310 --> 00:14:29.320
is that recruiters will often
ask, who do you know, right?

00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:31.450
Who can we go and
talk to and recruit?

00:14:31.450 --> 00:14:35.300
And if the people that you
know are very much like you,

00:14:35.300 --> 00:14:37.060
then that's going to
be a problem, right?

00:14:37.060 --> 00:14:40.257
Like there's network effects,
which is one small part.

00:14:40.257 --> 00:14:42.340
ELISSA SHEVINSKY: That's
a really important point.

00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:44.070
And that's often cited.

00:14:44.070 --> 00:14:50.070
When you have organizations
that are led by white men

00:14:50.070 --> 00:14:52.050
and many of the
employees are white men

00:14:52.050 --> 00:14:55.200
and then they're asked to
go to recruit their friends,

00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:58.060
they're going to go and recruit
people from their network.

00:14:58.060 --> 00:15:02.660
So we have this problem of, how
do we get outside our network

00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:04.200
and find all these
other people who

00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:06.230
are going to think differently?

00:15:06.230 --> 00:15:08.620
And I think that's
actually very important.

00:15:08.620 --> 00:15:10.350
I'm not a social
justice warrior.

00:15:10.350 --> 00:15:12.400
That's not the place
I'm coming from.

00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:14.370
I mean, I care about that a lot.

00:15:14.370 --> 00:15:16.280
But I'm worried
about how we're going

00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:18.950
to solve all these
problems without bringing

00:15:18.950 --> 00:15:21.402
in everyone's perspectives.

00:15:21.402 --> 00:15:23.110
AUDIENCE: So, I'm in
my mid 30s, and I've

00:15:23.110 --> 00:15:25.670
been in technology about
as long as you have,

00:15:25.670 --> 00:15:27.260
through the back door.

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:32.040
And I read that I'm
entering the big washout

00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:34.020
period for women in technology.

00:15:34.020 --> 00:15:38.150
And looking around, I actually
don't see many women much older

00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:39.330
than me.

00:15:39.330 --> 00:15:42.755
And I'm curious-- a few.

00:15:42.755 --> 00:15:43.880
You guys are very gracious.

00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:45.840
Thank you.

00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:50.665
But I really do wonder, it's
not just the pipeline issue.

00:15:50.665 --> 00:15:52.040
It's not that the
women are here.

00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:53.530
It's also that
women are choosing

00:15:53.530 --> 00:15:56.030
to leave technology companies.

00:15:56.030 --> 00:15:58.340
And in my own experience, I
think that culture actually

00:15:58.340 --> 00:15:59.780
does a lot to do with that.

00:15:59.780 --> 00:16:02.740
The higher you get, the
more the dukes come out,

00:16:02.740 --> 00:16:04.550
the more aggressive
and assertive,

00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:08.320
the more you really can't cry.

00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:11.805
What do you think about that
mid-career female technology

00:16:11.805 --> 00:16:13.670
path?

00:16:13.670 --> 00:16:16.870
ELISSA SHEVINSKY: I think
it's not only for women

00:16:16.870 --> 00:16:20.650
but that there's this
fetishization of youth.

00:16:20.650 --> 00:16:22.610
Now, I'm a [INAUDIBLE] mentor.

00:16:22.610 --> 00:16:26.256
I am very, very excited
that young people are

00:16:26.256 --> 00:16:27.880
being given the
opportunities they are,

00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:29.580
that they're being
taken seriously,

00:16:29.580 --> 00:16:33.470
and I love the work being done
by innovative young people.

00:16:33.470 --> 00:16:36.620
But I also love the work
done by older people.

00:16:36.620 --> 00:16:40.060
We do a different kind
of work in general.

00:16:40.060 --> 00:16:43.970
The people involved with me
and my company are all older

00:16:43.970 --> 00:16:44.900
than me.

00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:48.180
We're building an
enterprise security company.

00:16:48.180 --> 00:16:51.590
We're building stuff that needs
to scale, that cannot fail,

00:16:51.590 --> 00:16:53.610
that cannot have
vulnerabilities,

00:16:53.610 --> 00:16:56.440
that you can't build
over a hackathon weekend.

00:16:56.440 --> 00:17:02.530
And sometimes older
people in our ecosystem

00:17:02.530 --> 00:17:07.430
aren't valued as much as I'd
like to see them being valued.

00:17:07.430 --> 00:17:10.280
And that's true
for men and women.

00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:13.839
But these issues become
exacerbated for women

00:17:13.839 --> 00:17:16.695
because we're already
facing so much.

00:17:19.509 --> 00:17:21.050
AUDIENCE: Just to
put a stat on that,

00:17:21.050 --> 00:17:23.466
I believe I saw something about
the dropout rate for women

00:17:23.466 --> 00:17:28.910
after 10 years, and
tech is about 50%.

00:17:28.910 --> 00:17:31.520
But agreed since
I'm in that group,

00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:34.880
it's wonderful they
resolved the sexism that one

00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:36.540
had to deal with,
and now it's, oh,

00:17:36.540 --> 00:17:40.710
ageism plus sexism-- awesome.

00:17:40.710 --> 00:17:44.820
I have a question just about
the title of your book.

00:17:44.820 --> 00:17:49.170
The title "Lean Out" is
invoking obviously a reference

00:17:49.170 --> 00:17:51.500
to Sheryl Sandberg's book.

00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:58.450
And I was wondering how is your
message directly addressing

00:17:58.450 --> 00:18:00.130
her message?

00:18:00.130 --> 00:18:02.130
ELISSA SHEVINSKY: Not as
much as you would want.

00:18:02.130 --> 00:18:03.566
AUDIENCE: I was wondering.

00:18:03.566 --> 00:18:04.940
I didn't hear as
much of it here,

00:18:04.940 --> 00:18:07.600
and I was wondering in what
you've talked about so far,

00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:09.960
and I was wondering whether
there was more in the book.

00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:12.043
ELISSA SHEVINSKY: Right,
well, there is, actually.

00:18:12.043 --> 00:18:15.520
And it comes through when you
read the book as a collection.

00:18:15.520 --> 00:18:18.360
So I'm very grateful
to Sheryl Sandberg.

00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:21.870
I think that she's been
a trailblazer for women

00:18:21.870 --> 00:18:23.150
in tech and in business.

00:18:23.150 --> 00:18:25.790
It was really impactful
when her book came out

00:18:25.790 --> 00:18:29.780
to see someone of her stature
taking on feminism as an issue,

00:18:29.780 --> 00:18:31.900
encouraging women to be leaders.

00:18:31.900 --> 00:18:33.090
And we needed that.

00:18:33.090 --> 00:18:35.660
And that's why this book
has been a bestseller

00:18:35.660 --> 00:18:36.720
since it launched.

00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:41.480
But three years later,
"Lean In" just isn't enough,

00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:43.660
and it doesn't
speak to all of us.

00:18:43.660 --> 00:18:47.650
What "Lean Out" does
that I'm so proud of

00:18:47.650 --> 00:18:51.130
is it brings together
so many different voices

00:18:51.130 --> 00:18:53.100
from so many different people.

00:18:53.100 --> 00:18:55.270
And I'm not on the cover.

00:18:55.270 --> 00:19:00.740
The book is an
effort to encapsulate

00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:05.050
the experiences of as
many people as possible

00:19:05.050 --> 00:19:07.610
in the industry and
to speak to what

00:19:07.610 --> 00:19:12.000
it's like to be someone who
isn't white and over-educated

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:13.180
and reasonably pretty.

00:19:13.180 --> 00:19:17.290
And I'm too close
to that demographic,

00:19:17.290 --> 00:19:21.630
which is why there's so many
collaborators in this text.

00:19:21.630 --> 00:19:25.230
And it speaks to being
a person of color,

00:19:25.230 --> 00:19:27.920
being LGBTQ, being in gaming.

00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:31.950
And there's something
really powerful about that.

00:19:31.950 --> 00:19:33.690
I think we all see
that, that it's

00:19:33.690 --> 00:19:37.040
time not only for more
voices to be heard

00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:40.060
but for more approaches, right?

00:19:40.060 --> 00:19:42.860
Like one of the chapters in
"Lean Out" talks about not

00:19:42.860 --> 00:19:44.670
drinking the Kool-Aid.

00:19:44.670 --> 00:19:49.290
And just one approach
really doesn't fit all.

00:19:49.290 --> 00:19:53.350
I was just on Twitter, and
Sam Altman was giving advice.

00:19:53.350 --> 00:19:57.980
And it was like, man, like this
it works for the 20 people who

00:19:57.980 --> 00:19:59.900
you're mentoring right now.

00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:05.960
And those of us who aren't
fitting into that mold,

00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:08.990
we need to start
doing things our way.

00:20:08.990 --> 00:20:12.620
And the book hints
at that and explores

00:20:12.620 --> 00:20:15.510
that in different chapters.

00:20:15.510 --> 00:20:19.160
I think one example
I like to give

00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:22.780
is how it's harder for
women and people of color

00:20:22.780 --> 00:20:25.430
to get really
early-stage funding.

00:20:25.430 --> 00:20:27.510
It's always hard to get
early-stage funding.

00:20:27.510 --> 00:20:29.350
I have a lot of white
guys coming to me,

00:20:29.350 --> 00:20:31.910
and they're like,
Elissa, can you help me?

00:20:31.910 --> 00:20:36.050
So the ecosystem is hard on
a lot of people right now,

00:20:36.050 --> 00:20:40.680
but it's like almost impossible
for women and people of color.

00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:45.950
So Melanie Moore's advice in
the book, and I'm echoing that,

00:20:45.950 --> 00:20:48.670
is to build a business
with customers,

00:20:48.670 --> 00:20:50.866
try and go around
these obstacles.

00:20:53.425 --> 00:20:57.420
If Silicon Valley
isn't working for you,

00:20:57.420 --> 00:20:59.300
we need to figure
out another way.

00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:02.160
Maybe it means building
a lifestyle business,

00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:05.100
but maybe that shouldn't
be stigmatized.

00:21:05.100 --> 00:21:08.870
Silicon Valley VC firms are
not giving a return back

00:21:08.870 --> 00:21:10.430
to their investors.

00:21:10.430 --> 00:21:11.860
Startups are failing.

00:21:11.860 --> 00:21:15.440
The default is that VC
firms and startups fail.

00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:17.640
So it's time that
we stop stigmatizing

00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:22.830
these profitable, stable
lifestyle companies with people

00:21:22.830 --> 00:21:26.830
who are actually building
businesses with real customers.

00:21:26.830 --> 00:21:30.880
AUDIENCE: There is a very good
op-ed piece in "The New York

00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:36.010
Times" today about
the gender gap in pay.

00:21:36.010 --> 00:21:38.650
And one of the things
that it points out

00:21:38.650 --> 00:21:42.560
is that the UK now requires
large companies to publish

00:21:42.560 --> 00:21:44.790
their gender gap figures.

00:21:44.790 --> 00:21:48.570
When PricewaterhouseCoopers
in the UK did this,

00:21:48.570 --> 00:21:50.960
they discovered that
almost the entire pay

00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:55.720
gap was due to lack of
women in higher positions.

00:21:55.720 --> 00:21:57.770
And so they studied
it, and they found out

00:21:57.770 --> 00:22:01.650
that indeed there was a serious
promotion problem, just backing

00:22:01.650 --> 00:22:03.660
up your point.

00:22:03.660 --> 00:22:08.710
Now, I know that Google has
internally studied promotions

00:22:08.710 --> 00:22:10.857
in the last few years.

00:22:10.857 --> 00:22:12.940
It's been a while since I
looked at those figures.

00:22:12.940 --> 00:22:15.640
I don't remember what
the conclusion was.

00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:20.000
I don't remember that there was
a huge gap in promotion rates,

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:22.020
but I may be totally
misremembering.

00:22:22.020 --> 00:22:24.094
Maybe other people do.

00:22:24.094 --> 00:22:26.260
So that would be one thing
if somebody would answer.

00:22:26.260 --> 00:22:31.200
But two of the
really common reasons

00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:33.770
that are now cited
for this problem

00:22:33.770 --> 00:22:36.410
basically put the onus on women.

00:22:36.410 --> 00:22:40.390
One is that women
take more time off

00:22:40.390 --> 00:22:43.370
than men, of course to have
families and so forth and just

00:22:43.370 --> 00:22:45.650
in general once
they have families,

00:22:45.650 --> 00:22:48.290
are not willing to work
the crazy hours that men

00:22:48.290 --> 00:22:51.770
are, because they want to devote
more time to their families.

00:22:51.770 --> 00:22:55.010
And as a result of this,
they don't get promoted.

00:22:55.010 --> 00:22:57.330
The other thing that
people often say

00:22:57.330 --> 00:22:59.860
is that women are simply
not aggressive enough

00:22:59.860 --> 00:23:02.970
in pursuing both promotion
and higher salaries.

00:23:02.970 --> 00:23:04.740
They don't ask for them.

00:23:04.740 --> 00:23:08.490
And when they do ask, they
don't ask for as much as men do.

00:23:08.490 --> 00:23:11.820
So I'd be really
interested in your response

00:23:11.820 --> 00:23:13.685
to those two things,
which one now

00:23:13.685 --> 00:23:17.110
sees just about
everywhere cited as two

00:23:17.110 --> 00:23:18.660
of the really main reasons.

00:23:18.660 --> 00:23:23.940
ELISSA SHEVINSKY:
Right, so I understand

00:23:23.940 --> 00:23:27.610
how people can look at that
data and say, well, it's fair.

00:23:27.610 --> 00:23:29.550
But I actually
think that it's BS.

00:23:29.550 --> 00:23:33.110
Because you have a system that
was created by men for men.

00:23:33.110 --> 00:23:35.660
And now women are coming in.

00:23:35.660 --> 00:23:39.340
And the thing is, men are now
saying they want women here,

00:23:39.340 --> 00:23:42.830
whether that's because of
political and social pressure

00:23:42.830 --> 00:23:46.020
or because they actually
see the value of women

00:23:46.020 --> 00:23:47.260
in the workplace.

00:23:47.260 --> 00:23:51.890
Nonetheless, we have the
leadership at companies saying,

00:23:51.890 --> 00:23:54.880
we want women here
in our companies,

00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:58.290
we want to retain them, and
we want to promote them.

00:23:58.290 --> 00:24:02.720
So we need to find ways
to do that without placing

00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:04.950
all of the onus on women.

00:24:04.950 --> 00:24:09.360
And we know that women
negotiate differently than men.

00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:14.620
Why is our system
for promotions based

00:24:14.620 --> 00:24:17.030
on this setup that makes
sense for men and not

00:24:17.030 --> 00:24:19.550
for women when women are
now coming in the workforce

00:24:19.550 --> 00:24:22.180
and we're saying that we
want to integrate them

00:24:22.180 --> 00:24:23.630
in a meaningful way?

00:24:23.630 --> 00:24:27.940
I think that's the lens
that's useful to look at this.

00:24:27.940 --> 00:24:31.810
Yes, women aren't
playing the game the way

00:24:31.810 --> 00:24:33.880
men are expecting them to.

00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:38.950
But if we want women
to be at our companies

00:24:38.950 --> 00:24:42.820
and stay and be happy and be
promoted, that's on all of us

00:24:42.820 --> 00:24:45.080
to figure out how
we change things.

00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:48.890
And that's part of what
"Lean Out" means to me.

00:24:48.890 --> 00:24:51.150
"Lean In" was saying,
all right, women,

00:24:51.150 --> 00:24:54.260
like this is how you behave
like men to get ahead

00:24:54.260 --> 00:24:56.690
and get that seat
in the boardroom.

00:24:56.690 --> 00:25:01.860
And that was a step
forward, but now

00:25:01.860 --> 00:25:04.850
that men are saying
they want women here,

00:25:04.850 --> 00:25:09.880
now it's time to say, how
does the workplace accommodate

00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:10.380
women?

00:25:10.380 --> 00:25:15.140
How do men start to change their
behaviors to welcome us here?

00:25:15.140 --> 00:25:18.560
That's the conversation I
want us to start having.

00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:19.275
And it's hard.

00:25:22.450 --> 00:25:23.730
In the back.

00:25:23.730 --> 00:25:27.100
AUDIENCE: One thing
that you brought up

00:25:27.100 --> 00:25:28.570
that took me a
while to internalize

00:25:28.570 --> 00:25:30.070
is when you said funding.

00:25:30.070 --> 00:25:31.830
Because I have
friends in academia,

00:25:31.830 --> 00:25:33.810
and so originally I thought you
were talking academic funding.

00:25:33.810 --> 00:25:35.880
But I believe you're talking
about things like VC funding.

00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:36.570
Is that correct?

00:25:36.570 --> 00:25:38.380
ELISSA SHEVINSKY:
Right, I'm coming

00:25:38.380 --> 00:25:39.900
from the startup community.

00:25:39.900 --> 00:25:42.660
And I have a bias in my
language towards that.

00:25:42.660 --> 00:25:46.459
I'm very interested in academia,
but I don't know much about it.

00:25:46.459 --> 00:25:48.750
AUDIENCE: Yeah, we just came
from two different worlds,

00:25:48.750 --> 00:25:50.280
and now I'm getting it.

00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:53.560
And it's interesting because
I wonder to what extent

00:25:53.560 --> 00:25:57.330
that feature of the
tech world right now,

00:25:57.330 --> 00:26:03.020
the fact that one of the
images of the very, very

00:26:03.020 --> 00:26:06.820
successful person in our world
is someone who has come up

00:26:06.820 --> 00:26:10.140
with an idea, gone in
front of investors, said,

00:26:10.140 --> 00:26:11.080
here's my idea.

00:26:11.080 --> 00:26:12.180
Do you believe in my idea?

00:26:12.180 --> 00:26:15.170
Do you believe in me
to execute that idea?

00:26:15.170 --> 00:26:18.910
And that's the startup founder.

00:26:18.910 --> 00:26:21.030
There are many other
fields of business

00:26:21.030 --> 00:26:29.680
in which that is not nearly
as prevalent a model.

00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:32.127
Many more people in
that field of business

00:26:32.127 --> 00:26:34.460
might be someone who came up
through the ranks in a very

00:26:34.460 --> 00:26:36.660
established company,
and that's seen

00:26:36.660 --> 00:26:39.680
as being one very valid
way of being successful.

00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:45.080
I'm curious if the dynamics
of that, you think,

00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:48.280
are somewhat holding
tech back compared

00:26:48.280 --> 00:26:51.880
to other fields of business,
that feature of the economics

00:26:51.880 --> 00:26:52.880
of the business?

00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:55.690
ELISSA SHEVINSKY: I think
tech is doing great, actually.

00:26:55.690 --> 00:26:59.880
I think that we're seeing
tremendous innovation

00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:02.230
in technology.

00:27:02.230 --> 00:27:05.740
People like [INAUDIBLE]
critique technology

00:27:05.740 --> 00:27:11.390
for not necessarily focusing
on important enough problems.

00:27:11.390 --> 00:27:13.670
And I think there's something
to be said for that.

00:27:13.670 --> 00:27:17.180
But of all the industries,
you look at technology,

00:27:17.180 --> 00:27:19.890
and the pace of innovation
is just incredible.

00:27:19.890 --> 00:27:25.520
And I look at my own life and
the quality of my own life

00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:28.330
has improved so much
due to technology

00:27:28.330 --> 00:27:31.360
just in the last few years,
and much of that technology

00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:33.280
has come out of Silicon Valley.

00:27:33.280 --> 00:27:36.020
So as much as I'll stand here
and criticize some aspects,

00:27:36.020 --> 00:27:37.980
I do think there's
something there

00:27:37.980 --> 00:27:39.650
that's working really well.

00:27:39.650 --> 00:27:44.300
What I worry about with
funding is how much of that

00:27:44.300 --> 00:27:47.720
ends up being about camaraderie
or believing in someone.

00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:50.810
And I'll give an example
that I may regret later,

00:27:50.810 --> 00:27:54.850
given that this is a live feed,
but I think it's important.

00:27:54.850 --> 00:27:59.210
I was fundraising last year with
my co-founder, Pax Dickinson.

00:27:59.210 --> 00:28:04.030
And we had between 10% and
20% week over week traction

00:28:04.030 --> 00:28:05.330
with the teenage market.

00:28:05.330 --> 00:28:09.300
We were able to go into a
school and get any target group

00:28:09.300 --> 00:28:11.740
off Snapchat using us instead.

00:28:11.740 --> 00:28:15.270
So we had a lot going for us.

00:28:15.270 --> 00:28:17.500
But we had problems
as well, some of which

00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:19.220
are pretty well known.

00:28:19.220 --> 00:28:22.660
What's interesting
is the VC response.

00:28:22.660 --> 00:28:25.210
Some of the feedback
I've gotten was

00:28:25.210 --> 00:28:28.175
that, Elissa is too confident.

00:28:28.175 --> 00:28:30.900
She gave too high a valuation.

00:28:30.900 --> 00:28:34.770
The other feedback is, Elissa
is not confident enough.

00:28:34.770 --> 00:28:38.620
So there was this kind
of intense scrutiny

00:28:38.620 --> 00:28:41.010
around my confidence level.

00:28:41.010 --> 00:28:44.420
And I'm not sure
that gendered or not.

00:28:44.420 --> 00:28:46.200
That's part of the
problem we deal with.

00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:48.320
That's why it's
helpful for us to have

00:28:48.320 --> 00:28:51.270
these kinds of conversations,
talk on social media,

00:28:51.270 --> 00:28:54.330
discover if there's
a commonality,

00:28:54.330 --> 00:28:57.640
if gender is that commonality
in a lot of experiences people

00:28:57.640 --> 00:28:58.720
are having.

00:28:58.720 --> 00:29:03.070
But I suspect that my gender
may have had something

00:29:03.070 --> 00:29:04.460
to do with that.

00:29:04.460 --> 00:29:07.700
Why was everyone so focused
on my confidence level?

00:29:07.700 --> 00:29:10.790
We had really great traction.

00:29:10.790 --> 00:29:13.100
AUDIENCE: So I also
have a question, which

00:29:13.100 --> 00:29:18.120
is one thing that I've heard a
lot in the past couple of years

00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:23.510
is that part of the problem
with recruiting women who

00:29:23.510 --> 00:29:26.240
are already here
and able to code

00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:31.940
is that the very small number
of women in the company

00:29:31.940 --> 00:29:34.110
is part of the problem,
and it's also part

00:29:34.110 --> 00:29:35.700
of the problem for retention.

00:29:35.700 --> 00:29:38.080
That is, those who are
already in the company

00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:41.250
are more likely to leave because
of the culture in which there

00:29:41.250 --> 00:29:43.110
are very few women.

00:29:43.110 --> 00:29:47.370
So I wonder what you think about
the interplay between retention

00:29:47.370 --> 00:29:50.560
and recruiting and pipeline
and how maybe each one of them

00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:51.609
affects the other.

00:29:51.609 --> 00:29:53.150
ELISSA SHEVINSKY:
That's interesting.

00:29:53.150 --> 00:29:57.700
I've been here a lot
from women involved

00:29:57.700 --> 00:30:02.220
in diversity outreach efforts
within their own companies.

00:30:02.220 --> 00:30:05.780
And it seems to be
very draining for them.

00:30:05.780 --> 00:30:08.160
I don't know
anything about this.

00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:11.420
I kind of became like
this accidental feminist.

00:30:11.420 --> 00:30:14.260
And like here I am, and
now obviously I'm in it.

00:30:14.260 --> 00:30:16.730
But when I started
Glimpse with Pax,

00:30:16.730 --> 00:30:19.500
we just hired the
people who we could.

00:30:19.500 --> 00:30:22.850
We were grateful that we
could hire anyone at the time.

00:30:22.850 --> 00:30:24.960
And we hired a
bunch of white boys,

00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:29.380
because that's who we knew
and that's who worked for us,

00:30:29.380 --> 00:30:32.260
and we weren't thinking
about it very hard.

00:30:32.260 --> 00:30:37.250
And so I actually have never
been in that corporate setting

00:30:37.250 --> 00:30:39.780
where someone's asked
me to take this on.

00:30:39.780 --> 00:30:46.770
But I think that companies need
to be very aware that women,

00:30:46.770 --> 00:30:50.760
feminists, civil rights
activists, they consider

00:30:50.760 --> 00:30:54.210
that to be unpaid
emotional work and are not

00:30:54.210 --> 00:30:55.730
necessarily happy about it.

00:30:55.730 --> 00:30:58.260
I think the companies
look at it as a favor,

00:30:58.260 --> 00:31:02.579
like here we are at
this big tech company,

00:31:02.579 --> 00:31:04.870
and we're going to care about
the thing you care about,

00:31:04.870 --> 00:31:07.900
so here, go do 20
hours worth of work.

00:31:07.900 --> 00:31:12.160
I think if the companies made
it like a really important

00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:16.540
position in the company
and really well paid,

00:31:16.540 --> 00:31:20.700
I think if there was
more benefit and prestige

00:31:20.700 --> 00:31:26.380
and tangible reward
attached to doing that work,

00:31:26.380 --> 00:31:30.120
then that would help retain the
women who are in the company

00:31:30.120 --> 00:31:33.690
and bring in new people.

00:31:33.690 --> 00:31:35.700
But we could talk
about this all day.

00:31:35.700 --> 00:31:37.630
It's a really,
really hard problem,

00:31:37.630 --> 00:31:41.810
and I suspect that those of you
who are actually here at Google

00:31:41.810 --> 00:31:43.830
probably have more
insight than I do,

00:31:43.830 --> 00:31:47.450
although I'm studying
this pretty hard.

00:31:47.450 --> 00:31:48.984
In the back.

00:31:48.984 --> 00:31:50.400
AUDIENCE: So I
have two questions,

00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:52.010
but I'll stick with one for now.

00:31:52.010 --> 00:31:53.821
I'm a proud Harvey Mudd alumni.

00:31:53.821 --> 00:31:55.070
ELISSA SHEVINSKY: Harvey Mudd!

00:31:55.070 --> 00:31:56.090
AUDIENCE: Yes!

00:31:56.090 --> 00:31:57.590
They've done a bunch
of stuff that's

00:31:57.590 --> 00:31:59.540
been incredibly successful
in getting women

00:31:59.540 --> 00:32:01.507
into computer science
by making small changes.

00:32:01.507 --> 00:32:03.090
And I've talked with
them a little bit

00:32:03.090 --> 00:32:04.650
about their theories
about why it works,

00:32:04.650 --> 00:32:06.430
and there's some
interesting stuff there.

00:32:06.430 --> 00:32:08.230
And they've also
done a whole bunch

00:32:08.230 --> 00:32:10.760
even more recently to bring in
underrepresented minorities.

00:32:10.760 --> 00:32:14.120
And one of the things that
changed the average acceptance

00:32:14.120 --> 00:32:16.960
rate from below the overall
Mudd acceptance rate

00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:19.960
to higher than that was
just having faculty,

00:32:19.960 --> 00:32:22.210
which self-organized
on a mailing list,

00:32:22.210 --> 00:32:24.920
call every accepted student
and say, hey, we like you,

00:32:24.920 --> 00:32:26.810
and we would like
you to be here.

00:32:26.810 --> 00:32:29.150
And that small change
made a big effect,

00:32:29.150 --> 00:32:33.630
and now the new student
rate is much improved,

00:32:33.630 --> 00:32:36.330
and it makes a big
difference on campus.

00:32:36.330 --> 00:32:38.840
Do you have thoughts on
things that tech companies

00:32:38.840 --> 00:32:41.965
can actually do that might make
similar substantial changes?

00:32:41.965 --> 00:32:43.590
ELISSA SHEVINSKY: I
think that's right.

00:32:43.590 --> 00:32:46.780
I have a friend who
did work at Google.

00:32:46.780 --> 00:32:49.110
And actually she
still works at Google.

00:32:49.110 --> 00:32:51.410
She's been very successful here.

00:32:51.410 --> 00:32:54.310
And Facebook tried
to steal her away.

00:32:54.310 --> 00:32:57.820
And Sheryl Sandberg herself
called her on the phone

00:32:57.820 --> 00:33:01.570
and encouraged her to lean in
and said, we want you here.

00:33:01.570 --> 00:33:03.710
I want you here.

00:33:03.710 --> 00:33:05.770
And that was very meaningful.

00:33:05.770 --> 00:33:10.450
And this friend of mine
ended up staying at Google.

00:33:10.450 --> 00:33:14.390
But she's also
deeply wanted here.

00:33:14.390 --> 00:33:15.500
And she knows that.

00:33:15.500 --> 00:33:19.090
I think there's something
really powerful about knowing

00:33:19.090 --> 00:33:21.890
that a place wants you.

00:33:21.890 --> 00:33:26.100
I recently joined the Mach37
Cybersecurity Accelerator.

00:33:26.100 --> 00:33:28.330
I don't know how
much all of you know

00:33:28.330 --> 00:33:32.070
about the infosec industry,
but especially in DC,

00:33:32.070 --> 00:33:33.650
it's not only white
and male, it's

00:33:33.650 --> 00:33:35.830
white and male and military.

00:33:35.830 --> 00:33:39.240
So it's not a place
that I would have

00:33:39.240 --> 00:33:42.580
thought is naturally my place.

00:33:42.580 --> 00:33:46.380
But I knew that they
really wanted me,

00:33:46.380 --> 00:33:50.920
and then when I got
there, it was really nice.

00:33:50.920 --> 00:33:53.510
And we were part of the
first class of women,

00:33:53.510 --> 00:33:57.510
and there was some learning
for everyone around that.

00:33:57.510 --> 00:34:02.290
But I didn't care
that this program was

00:34:02.290 --> 00:34:04.632
run by white men,
most of the alumni

00:34:04.632 --> 00:34:06.090
and the connections
were white men.

00:34:06.090 --> 00:34:07.610
It was like, we're all hackers.

00:34:07.610 --> 00:34:10.100
We have that in common,
and they want me.

00:34:10.100 --> 00:34:12.679
And I talk about that in the
book, too, in "Lean Out."

00:34:12.679 --> 00:34:16.340
And everyone who is here gets
a free copy so you can read it.

00:34:16.340 --> 00:34:18.800
When I got into
computer science,

00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:21.929
it's because they wanted me.

00:34:21.929 --> 00:34:23.949
That was very impactful.

00:34:23.949 --> 00:34:26.300
I was getting recruited
left and right.

00:34:26.300 --> 00:34:29.580
The computer science department
was really warm and friendly.

00:34:29.580 --> 00:34:32.139
Everyone wanted to
teach me how to code.

00:34:32.139 --> 00:34:35.250
And I think that has a lot
to do with where I am now

00:34:35.250 --> 00:34:39.750
in tech, where I love it
and all of this sexism

00:34:39.750 --> 00:34:41.530
just feel so foreign
to me, like it's

00:34:41.530 --> 00:34:45.889
this thing that's happened that
I can't even believe happened.

00:34:45.889 --> 00:34:47.659
Because when I got
into technology,

00:34:47.659 --> 00:34:50.690
that was not my
experience at all.

00:34:50.690 --> 00:34:54.870
And I think that that's
a big step for us,

00:34:54.870 --> 00:34:57.764
to let people know
that they're wanted.

00:34:57.764 --> 00:34:59.180
AUDIENCE: Maybe
one followup thing

00:34:59.180 --> 00:35:01.220
is that I think a lot
of people at Google

00:35:01.220 --> 00:35:03.160
often feel impostor syndrome.

00:35:03.160 --> 00:35:05.740
And I think there's gendered
aspects to that in general,

00:35:05.740 --> 00:35:09.729
but I also think there is
this, am I really good enough?

00:35:09.729 --> 00:35:12.270
And here I am doing this hiring,
and would I pass this hiring

00:35:12.270 --> 00:35:14.960
interview, can lead to
doubt about whether you're

00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:16.130
really qualified in general.

00:35:16.130 --> 00:35:17.590
And with that, am
I really wanted?

00:35:17.590 --> 00:35:19.299
Or would somebody
else be better?

00:35:19.299 --> 00:35:21.340
Which I don't think is
necessarily only gendered,

00:35:21.340 --> 00:35:22.870
but I think it plays
into the, where else

00:35:22.870 --> 00:35:24.840
are you getting signals
about being wanted?

00:35:24.840 --> 00:35:27.590
ELISSA SHEVINSKY:
Right, and it's

00:35:27.590 --> 00:35:31.580
been talked about very widely,
but it's worth reiterating here

00:35:31.580 --> 00:35:35.740
that women will only apply for a
job if they're super qualified,

00:35:35.740 --> 00:35:39.260
whereas men will apply if
like-- they'll just apply.

00:35:39.260 --> 00:35:42.610
And I'm trying to learn
that lesson myself.

00:35:42.610 --> 00:35:46.430
And I should have just applied
to Google+ when I thought that

00:35:46.430 --> 00:35:48.740
was like the most
badass thing ever.

00:35:48.740 --> 00:35:51.370
And I didn't because I didn't.

00:35:51.370 --> 00:35:56.910
Because as confident as
I am, I didn't have it.

00:35:56.910 --> 00:36:05.010
So when we do our recruitment
process, we need to know that.

00:36:05.010 --> 00:36:07.490
If we actually
really want women,

00:36:07.490 --> 00:36:09.675
we need recruit for women.

00:36:12.837 --> 00:36:14.670
AUDIENCE: I think there's
also an aspect of,

00:36:14.670 --> 00:36:16.370
if there's a culture
of elitism, you

00:36:16.370 --> 00:36:18.730
have to actually tell people
at some point, you're OK.

00:36:18.730 --> 00:36:20.370
ELISSA SHEVINSKY: Yes.

00:36:20.370 --> 00:36:21.910
Yeah, like you're here.

00:36:21.910 --> 00:36:25.160
You're one of us,
for better or worse.

00:36:25.160 --> 00:36:28.460
And you're not the only one
who's figuring out your job.

00:36:32.470 --> 00:36:33.490
Any other questions?

00:36:33.490 --> 00:36:34.644
Yes.

00:36:34.644 --> 00:36:36.060
AUDIENCE: This
isn't a question so

00:36:36.060 --> 00:36:38.980
much as to respond to
your point about what

00:36:38.980 --> 00:36:41.136
small, concrete
actions could be taken.

00:36:41.136 --> 00:36:42.760
I just wanted to
share something that I

00:36:42.760 --> 00:36:44.745
know my previous company did.

00:36:44.745 --> 00:36:46.620
They're called [INAUDIBLE],
and they actually

00:36:46.620 --> 00:36:50.730
do pretty well in terms of
hiring women and minorities.

00:36:50.730 --> 00:36:52.654
And one thing they do
in the interview process

00:36:52.654 --> 00:36:54.320
is, for one, they
always make sure there

00:36:54.320 --> 00:36:56.040
are two people interviewing.

00:36:56.040 --> 00:36:58.610
And they also treat certain
things like [INAUDIBLE]

00:36:58.610 --> 00:37:01.260
when an interviewer
says, I don't think

00:37:01.260 --> 00:37:03.920
they're going to fit in, or,
I don't think they're like me,

00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:06.550
they immediately throw that
out, because that will just

00:37:06.550 --> 00:37:09.380
encourage a company that has a
certain culture to keep hiring

00:37:09.380 --> 00:37:10.970
people who are similar to them.

00:37:10.970 --> 00:37:13.430
And it's a very natural
human thing to do.

00:37:13.430 --> 00:37:16.220
But they explicitly make sure
that as part of the interview

00:37:16.220 --> 00:37:20.390
process, they don't
want that to factor in.

00:37:20.390 --> 00:37:22.420
AUDIENCE: Just to tie
together these two

00:37:22.420 --> 00:37:24.900
comments about the
rate of promotion

00:37:24.900 --> 00:37:27.640
at Google, so when
they did the study,

00:37:27.640 --> 00:37:31.510
they found that at every
level, as you go up,

00:37:31.510 --> 00:37:34.210
the number of women at
that level are halved.

00:37:34.210 --> 00:37:39.310
And so when you get to a certain
level, the percentage of women

00:37:39.310 --> 00:37:41.750
is very low.

00:37:41.750 --> 00:37:44.090
And that's the
case in Cambridge,

00:37:44.090 --> 00:37:45.900
as well as elsewhere.

00:37:45.900 --> 00:37:49.600
And when they did that
study several years ago,

00:37:49.600 --> 00:37:53.720
they noticed that when
women went up for promotion,

00:37:53.720 --> 00:37:55.760
they were promoted
at the same rate

00:37:55.760 --> 00:37:57.480
as their male
counterparts, but they

00:37:57.480 --> 00:38:04.190
were trying to go up for
promotion half as often.

00:38:04.190 --> 00:38:07.700
And the sad part about
that was the conclusion

00:38:07.700 --> 00:38:11.850
was that women weren't
trying to get promoted.

00:38:11.850 --> 00:38:14.910
And there were many of us
who, I think at the time,

00:38:14.910 --> 00:38:18.450
were upset about that,
because usually people go up

00:38:18.450 --> 00:38:21.202
for promotion when they get
a signal from their boss

00:38:21.202 --> 00:38:24.450
that that's going to go through.

00:38:24.450 --> 00:38:28.780
And so there are signals
about feeling wanted,

00:38:28.780 --> 00:38:31.780
about feeling accepted, that
maybe were not getting through

00:38:31.780 --> 00:38:38.800
or simply the managers were
not indicating beforehand,

00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:40.916
well, I think you
should try to go up.

00:38:40.916 --> 00:38:44.730
ELISSA SHEVINSKY: I think that's
right in that there's just

00:38:44.730 --> 00:38:46.880
so many elephants in the room.

00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:51.340
There's so much that
we don't talk about.

00:38:51.340 --> 00:38:53.990
I was in a conversation
in a closed Facebook group

00:38:53.990 --> 00:39:00.350
recently that delved
into some of the concerns

00:39:00.350 --> 00:39:03.230
that hiring managers
have about women.

00:39:03.230 --> 00:39:06.980
And in this case, some of
those interviewers and hiring

00:39:06.980 --> 00:39:10.390
managers had made their concerns
explicit without realizing

00:39:10.390 --> 00:39:14.780
they were expressing illegal or
just kind of offensive things,

00:39:14.780 --> 00:39:20.310
including trying to suss out
if the women were about to make

00:39:20.310 --> 00:39:23.100
babies or interested in
making babies and just all

00:39:23.100 --> 00:39:27.660
the presumption that women after
a certain age, that age being I

00:39:27.660 --> 00:39:32.880
guess, I don't know, 17, are
going to see at some point

00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:35.650
drop their careers and
go and make babies.

00:39:35.650 --> 00:39:40.760
And that's very frustrating
for the women who

00:39:40.760 --> 00:39:44.740
feel that by showing up to
interview or by showing up

00:39:44.740 --> 00:39:49.930
to ask for capital, they're
saying that they're in it.

00:39:49.930 --> 00:39:51.660
And that's my feeling,
like if I show up

00:39:51.660 --> 00:39:53.160
and I say I'm going
to do it, I want

00:39:53.160 --> 00:39:55.100
you to take that at face value.

00:39:55.100 --> 00:39:59.320
So I worry about that
with some of these issues

00:39:59.320 --> 00:40:02.360
that the hiring
managers may assume--

00:40:02.360 --> 00:40:08.140
like there may be both implicit
and explicit bias there.

00:40:08.140 --> 00:40:09.319
And also.

00:40:09.319 --> 00:40:10.860
If I may-- and hey,
I have the stage,

00:40:10.860 --> 00:40:15.300
so I can-- women
will say that they're

00:40:15.300 --> 00:40:20.920
leaving for family or for
babies or for all these reasons,

00:40:20.920 --> 00:40:22.530
and that's not always why.

00:40:22.530 --> 00:40:26.180
And I say this as someone
who has leaned out and left

00:40:26.180 --> 00:40:27.910
so many times.

00:40:27.910 --> 00:40:33.490
And it's only now that
I'm more self-aware

00:40:33.490 --> 00:40:35.900
and that I'm aware of these
issues in the industry

00:40:35.900 --> 00:40:39.620
that I can look back and
say, oh, yeah, that time

00:40:39.620 --> 00:40:42.820
that I left the country,
like I quit my job

00:40:42.820 --> 00:40:45.330
and left the country,
it's because I

00:40:45.330 --> 00:40:48.470
felt like I'd run out of
options at my current company.

00:40:48.470 --> 00:40:54.000
I didn't understand how I could
improve my career back in 2005.

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:55.750
I was thinking
maybe grad school,

00:40:55.750 --> 00:40:58.010
but that felt very amorphous.

00:40:58.010 --> 00:40:59.880
And I ended up an
ex-pat, and then I

00:40:59.880 --> 00:41:03.670
ended up married and
years of adventures.

00:41:03.670 --> 00:41:06.160
And why did that happen?

00:41:06.160 --> 00:41:10.270
It happened because
what I really wanted

00:41:10.270 --> 00:41:12.840
was to be a vice president
at Everyday Health.

00:41:12.840 --> 00:41:15.120
I didn't know how to get there.

00:41:15.120 --> 00:41:16.160
I mean, now I do.

00:41:16.160 --> 00:41:18.080
I don't plan to leave.

00:41:18.080 --> 00:41:18.790
I'm pretty busy.

00:41:18.790 --> 00:41:22.080
But that's one reason, right?

00:41:22.080 --> 00:41:23.720
And I see heads nodding.

00:41:23.720 --> 00:41:28.810
Women don't want to leave,
but they can't stay.

00:41:28.810 --> 00:41:33.540
The other reason is the
real elephant in the room,

00:41:33.540 --> 00:41:36.690
and it's even harder
to talk about, which

00:41:36.690 --> 00:41:43.230
is women end up sometimes
with very intense harassment.

00:41:43.230 --> 00:41:48.160
My book describes a woman
who's describing rape at work.

00:41:48.160 --> 00:41:51.240
There are things that
people experience sometimes

00:41:51.240 --> 00:41:54.530
that are deeply traumatic,
and you can't talk about it.

00:41:57.360 --> 00:42:00.350
I think it's really important
to read Katie Levinson's article

00:42:00.350 --> 00:42:01.860
on whistleblowing if you can.

00:42:01.860 --> 00:42:04.050
Sometimes women
can't talk about what

00:42:04.050 --> 00:42:05.650
happened to them
because it's not

00:42:05.650 --> 00:42:08.210
going to help them personally
and they're already

00:42:08.210 --> 00:42:10.620
struggling to deal with
what's happened to them.

00:42:10.620 --> 00:42:13.410
They're not in a position to be
an activist or to be a martyr.

00:42:13.410 --> 00:42:15.970
They need to get on with their
lives and figure things out.

00:42:15.970 --> 00:42:21.429
And so when we assume that women
are leaving to make babies,

00:42:21.429 --> 00:42:23.720
I just don't think that's
the reason why a lot of women

00:42:23.720 --> 00:42:24.920
are leaving.

00:42:24.920 --> 00:42:28.160
Yes, women leave for
family, but we often

00:42:28.160 --> 00:42:29.369
can't talk about why we left.

00:42:29.369 --> 00:42:30.868
AUDIENCE: I would
just like to point

00:42:30.868 --> 00:42:33.880
that [INAUDIBLE] is supposedly
spending time with his family

00:42:33.880 --> 00:42:35.750
right now.

00:42:35.750 --> 00:42:38.595
And Lucy made this
wonderful snarky point

00:42:38.595 --> 00:42:40.197
right behind me a
second ago that when

00:42:40.197 --> 00:42:41.780
men leave to say
they're spending time

00:42:41.780 --> 00:42:44.080
with their families,
especially if they have just

00:42:44.080 --> 00:42:46.950
led the company through a
giant, multi-year disaster,

00:42:46.950 --> 00:42:51.700
we all roll our eyes and we're
like, yeah, sure you are.

00:42:51.700 --> 00:42:53.530
But if a woman says
it, for some reason

00:42:53.530 --> 00:42:56.150
we believe her, and like,
what the fuck's up with that?

00:42:56.150 --> 00:42:57.650
ELISSA SHEVINSKY:
Yeah, women-- it's

00:42:57.650 --> 00:42:59.520
just the easy thing to say.

00:42:59.520 --> 00:43:02.820
You can't say, I'm
leaving because--

00:43:02.820 --> 00:43:05.060
and then fill in the
blank with something that

00:43:05.060 --> 00:43:07.010
would be a Gawker headline.

00:43:07.010 --> 00:43:09.920
No one wants that
for themselves.

00:43:09.920 --> 00:43:12.571
AUDIENCE: As just an
anecdote, I had my babies,

00:43:12.571 --> 00:43:14.820
and I made it clear to every
single manager since then

00:43:14.820 --> 00:43:17.480
that, no, two is enough.

00:43:17.480 --> 00:43:20.290
And at my last company,
I made it explicit,

00:43:20.290 --> 00:43:22.660
extraordinarily explicit
in every single review

00:43:22.660 --> 00:43:25.070
that I was looking
for leadership.

00:43:25.070 --> 00:43:30.550
And my CEO told me that he did
not think of me as a leader.

00:43:30.550 --> 00:43:33.650
Please notice the
ex-company part of that.

00:43:33.650 --> 00:43:37.100
But it would have been way
easier, so much less conflict,

00:43:37.100 --> 00:43:43.790
so much simpler for me to either
dodge, hide, use an excuse,

00:43:43.790 --> 00:43:46.980
stay low, hide my head,
just keep working hard

00:43:46.980 --> 00:43:49.140
and wait to be noticed.

00:43:49.140 --> 00:43:52.620
And I really started to feel
like-- my point was actually

00:43:52.620 --> 00:43:56.080
less about sexism than
mid-careerism, where you're

00:43:56.080 --> 00:43:58.630
looking for those first jobs
as a manager, as a leader,

00:43:58.630 --> 00:44:02.890
as a person in the company other
people look to for answers.

00:44:02.890 --> 00:44:05.890
And the people above
you say, I'm sorry,

00:44:05.890 --> 00:44:09.990
I just don't think
of you like that.

00:44:09.990 --> 00:44:13.690
ELISSA SHEVINSKY: And that
is why I'm a startup founder.

00:44:13.690 --> 00:44:17.920
But I would be very
interested in figuring out

00:44:17.920 --> 00:44:20.520
and understanding
a way for people

00:44:20.520 --> 00:44:23.740
to make that happen
in corporate life.

00:44:23.740 --> 00:44:28.601
And if anyone has ideas,
I would love to hear them.

00:44:28.601 --> 00:44:31.100
AUDIENCE: I'm not sure if it's
a question or an observation,

00:44:31.100 --> 00:44:33.930
but regarding the rates
of promotion at Google,

00:44:33.930 --> 00:44:37.570
Google is a little weird
in that in most companies,

00:44:37.570 --> 00:44:41.802
a manager says, hey, I think
you could do this other role,

00:44:41.802 --> 00:44:43.510
and they promote you,
and then you do it.

00:44:43.510 --> 00:44:47.120
And Google kind of looks to
you to have started working

00:44:47.120 --> 00:44:49.620
above your level already.

00:44:49.620 --> 00:44:53.990
And there could very
well be gendered barriers

00:44:53.990 --> 00:44:57.700
to doing that, but they might
be very different from the kind

00:44:57.700 --> 00:45:00.700
that block promotion
at other companies.

00:45:00.700 --> 00:45:03.370
Maybe it's a reluctance
to work above your level

00:45:03.370 --> 00:45:04.720
when you haven't been blessed.

00:45:04.720 --> 00:45:07.330
Maybe it's resistance
from other people

00:45:07.330 --> 00:45:10.320
to taking your leadership when
you haven't been promoted yet.

00:45:10.320 --> 00:45:12.690
Maybe it's lack
of encouragement.

00:45:12.690 --> 00:45:13.690
I don't know what it is.

00:45:13.690 --> 00:45:15.231
AUDIENCE: That is
really interesting.

00:45:15.231 --> 00:45:17.290
I want to speak to that
really briefly, because

00:45:17.290 --> 00:45:20.070
in this one particular way,
I'm a very stereotypical woman,

00:45:20.070 --> 00:45:23.074
so I can speak to the
like totally girly side.

00:45:23.074 --> 00:45:24.740
I've been at Google
for eight years now,

00:45:24.740 --> 00:45:27.940
and I've been eventually
through two promotions.

00:45:27.940 --> 00:45:30.740
And I am one of those people
who won't apply for the job

00:45:30.740 --> 00:45:32.624
unless they have every
single bullet point.

00:45:32.624 --> 00:45:34.290
And I also will not
go for the promotion

00:45:34.290 --> 00:45:36.130
until I have every
single bullet point.

00:45:36.130 --> 00:45:38.480
And for that reason, I think
it's actually kind of nice

00:45:38.480 --> 00:45:40.105
that Google lets you
work at that level

00:45:40.105 --> 00:45:42.162
before you take the
title, because I would not

00:45:42.162 --> 00:45:44.620
go up for the title until I
had actually done those things.

00:45:44.620 --> 00:45:47.120
Because I would say, I don't
know if I will try those things

00:45:47.120 --> 00:45:47.960
and fail.

00:45:47.960 --> 00:45:52.350
So I actually think it's a
very also feminine-style,

00:45:52.350 --> 00:45:55.364
friendly way to do it
that Google is doing.

00:45:55.364 --> 00:45:57.280
ELISSA SHEVINSKY: Well,
I'm glad to hear that,

00:45:57.280 --> 00:46:03.750
and I'm really optimistic about
what women are going to build.

00:46:03.750 --> 00:46:06.080
That's part of
the message that I

00:46:06.080 --> 00:46:08.880
hope will come through
with "Lean Out,"

00:46:08.880 --> 00:46:14.690
is that it's really hard relying
on systems that are already

00:46:14.690 --> 00:46:17.370
made, that other people made.

00:46:17.370 --> 00:46:20.710
I think that some of
the change that we're

00:46:20.710 --> 00:46:22.360
going to see in
Silicon Valley is

00:46:22.360 --> 00:46:25.640
going to come from just
creating our own institution

00:46:25.640 --> 00:46:28.180
and making new
ways to do things.

00:46:28.180 --> 00:46:31.156
And I think it's time for that.

00:46:31.156 --> 00:46:32.970
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
well, just to expand

00:46:32.970 --> 00:46:37.000
on that, how much of
the problem is just

00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:42.370
a pervasive culture that rewards
individualism and aggression.

00:46:42.370 --> 00:46:47.700
For example, when people
in the whole tech industry

00:46:47.700 --> 00:46:49.870
talk about the kind of
person they want to hire,

00:46:49.870 --> 00:46:52.580
they often use the
term rock star.

00:46:52.580 --> 00:46:54.240
I hate that term.

00:46:54.240 --> 00:46:56.170
I hate that term.

00:46:56.170 --> 00:46:58.880
I think it should be
completely banished.

00:46:58.880 --> 00:47:03.780
My associations with rock stars
are almost completely negative

00:47:03.780 --> 00:47:06.210
and not the kind of
people that succeed

00:47:06.210 --> 00:47:08.280
or that you would
want in your company.

00:47:08.280 --> 00:47:13.310
Why can't we have a
system that promotes

00:47:13.310 --> 00:47:18.982
cooperation, communication?

00:47:18.982 --> 00:47:20.440
Those are the kind
of things that I

00:47:20.440 --> 00:47:24.430
find most lacking among many
of the males that I work with.

00:47:24.430 --> 00:47:27.310
And they're extremely important.

00:47:27.310 --> 00:47:31.430
Companies, I think, and groups
that can promote those traits

00:47:31.430 --> 00:47:34.670
actually probably are more
successful than groups that

00:47:34.670 --> 00:47:37.250
don't.

00:47:37.250 --> 00:47:39.790
There's just so many
aspects of this culture

00:47:39.790 --> 00:47:45.430
that every day promote the kind
of individualist, aggressive

00:47:45.430 --> 00:47:48.590
traits that
stereotypical males have.

00:47:48.590 --> 00:47:51.180
ELISSA SHEVINSKY: Let's
take three more questions.

00:47:51.180 --> 00:47:53.810
And yes, 100%-- I
think that the best

00:47:53.810 --> 00:47:55.970
people on tech teams
in my experience

00:47:55.970 --> 00:47:59.300
are the ones who are like glue,
who somehow make everything

00:47:59.300 --> 00:48:00.202
go right.

00:48:00.202 --> 00:48:01.660
Like yes, there
are those engineers

00:48:01.660 --> 00:48:03.700
who are 10 times better
than everyone else.

00:48:03.700 --> 00:48:04.580
I've seen that.

00:48:04.580 --> 00:48:09.700
But in a team, that's not
always what it's about.

00:48:09.700 --> 00:48:14.960
And yeah, 100%, I think we
need to focus on collaboration.

00:48:14.960 --> 00:48:18.160
And in my personal experience,
just for me personally,

00:48:18.160 --> 00:48:21.380
the worst experiences
I've had at companies

00:48:21.380 --> 00:48:24.740
have been with people
whose egos were threatened

00:48:24.740 --> 00:48:28.157
and who maybe were
threatened by me

00:48:28.157 --> 00:48:30.240
or threatened by someone
else in the organization.

00:48:30.240 --> 00:48:33.270
And I'm personally
very interested

00:48:33.270 --> 00:48:35.510
in genuine meritocracy,
which is something

00:48:35.510 --> 00:48:37.680
that I don't see a lot of.

00:48:37.680 --> 00:48:41.070
But I believe personally
that if we found a way

00:48:41.070 --> 00:48:44.420
to have less like
egocentric, ego threatened,

00:48:44.420 --> 00:48:48.970
incompetent people in teams,
that it would be better

00:48:48.970 --> 00:48:52.350
for women, LGBTQ,
people of color.

00:48:52.350 --> 00:48:53.750
I know it would
be better for me.

00:48:53.750 --> 00:48:56.610
When I come in somewhere as a
strong woman and I'm excited

00:48:56.610 --> 00:48:58.670
and I'm ready to
do my part and I'm

00:48:58.670 --> 00:49:01.790
being treated like
an expert, there's

00:49:01.790 --> 00:49:05.480
that one person who's like,
she's figured out that I

00:49:05.480 --> 00:49:06.960
don't know what I'm doing.

00:49:06.960 --> 00:49:11.780
Like look, I'm not here to take
you down, but like they get up

00:49:11.780 --> 00:49:16.720
in my grill, and that's
that lack of cooperation.

00:49:16.720 --> 00:49:19.282
I think the best
people are thinking how

00:49:19.282 --> 00:49:20.490
we move the whole team ahead.

00:49:22.599 --> 00:49:24.390
AUDIENCE: And switching
gears a little bit,

00:49:24.390 --> 00:49:27.440
I was hoping you could expand
a little on your statement

00:49:27.440 --> 00:49:31.450
that the pipeline problem
is not the problem.

00:49:31.450 --> 00:49:33.330
Because I think
it's hard to deny

00:49:33.330 --> 00:49:39.440
that it is a problem, given that
graduating classes of computer

00:49:39.440 --> 00:49:47.520
science majors have something
like 20% women and 80% men.

00:49:47.520 --> 00:49:50.610
And while I acknowledge
all of the problems

00:49:50.610 --> 00:49:55.140
that you are you are pointing to
as definitely genuine problems

00:49:55.140 --> 00:50:00.050
in the industry
itself, could you just

00:50:00.050 --> 00:50:01.490
expand on that
statement and what

00:50:01.490 --> 00:50:04.970
you think we could do
better as opposed to having

00:50:04.970 --> 00:50:06.610
special programs for women?

00:50:06.610 --> 00:50:08.000
ELISSA SHEVINSKY:
Yeah, for sure.

00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:10.500
So part of what
I'm really trying

00:50:10.500 --> 00:50:14.190
to show in my chapter
"The Pipeline Problem"

00:50:14.190 --> 00:50:19.290
is that we all agree there's a
woman-in-tech problem, or a man

00:50:19.290 --> 00:50:22.860
problem, as Claire
Cain Miller put it.

00:50:22.860 --> 00:50:26.140
But it's a question
of perspective, right?

00:50:26.140 --> 00:50:30.980
The problems for female founders
and for female developers

00:50:30.980 --> 00:50:35.910
are different from the problems
faced by hiring managers.

00:50:35.910 --> 00:50:39.130
Now, hiring managers
have a pipeline problem.

00:50:39.130 --> 00:50:43.070
Hiring managers have a problem
that social justice warriors

00:50:43.070 --> 00:50:44.910
are yelling at them
when they don't

00:50:44.910 --> 00:50:47.010
have enough women in
their organizations

00:50:47.010 --> 00:50:48.900
and they need to
bring in more women,

00:50:48.900 --> 00:50:51.680
but that's hard because
the women are not

00:50:51.680 --> 00:50:54.130
showing up at the door.

00:50:54.130 --> 00:50:56.440
I'm not that worried
about that problem.

00:50:56.440 --> 00:50:59.030
If the executives at
Google have trouble

00:50:59.030 --> 00:51:05.250
hiring people and meeting their
bottom line, like I'm a CEO,

00:51:05.250 --> 00:51:07.320
I'm a venture capitalist.

00:51:07.320 --> 00:51:08.240
I'm down.

00:51:08.240 --> 00:51:12.160
I understand why they care
about that and I'm sympathetic,

00:51:12.160 --> 00:51:17.530
but I think that that's
the problem of executives

00:51:17.530 --> 00:51:19.710
in the technology industry
and of shareholders.

00:51:19.710 --> 00:51:22.350
And that's not who I'm
worrying about right now.

00:51:22.350 --> 00:51:25.740
The people I'm worrying about
are very specific demographics.

00:51:25.740 --> 00:51:29.610
I'm worried about the
women, the people of color,

00:51:29.610 --> 00:51:33.100
the LGBTQ people who
are already here,

00:51:33.100 --> 00:51:36.030
who are already
qualified, and they're

00:51:36.030 --> 00:51:38.350
having a nightmare of a time.

00:51:38.350 --> 00:51:41.260
And those are the people
I'm worried about.

00:51:41.260 --> 00:51:43.100
So I worry about
what happens if we're

00:51:43.100 --> 00:51:45.890
going to create more of that.

00:51:45.890 --> 00:51:50.230
Like why do we want so
bring in more people

00:51:50.230 --> 00:51:53.880
to an environment that
isn't ready for them?

00:51:53.880 --> 00:51:56.810
And I worry, OK, so what
if these organizations are

00:51:56.810 --> 00:51:58.800
trying to have one token woman?

00:51:58.800 --> 00:52:01.240
There are already, say, 10
women for that job right now.

00:52:01.240 --> 00:52:03.060
So you're going to
bring in another 30?

00:52:03.060 --> 00:52:06.689
OK, so now you have
39 unemployed women.

00:52:06.689 --> 00:52:07.980
That's what I'm worrying about.

00:52:07.980 --> 00:52:11.590
I'm not saying that there
isn't a problem of having women

00:52:11.590 --> 00:52:15.160
in these companies,
but I don't see

00:52:15.160 --> 00:52:19.220
how we bring more women
into where we are now.

00:52:19.220 --> 00:52:23.800
I think we need to make some
changes and welcome women.

00:52:23.800 --> 00:52:27.480
And the way to do that is
to hire and fund and promote

00:52:27.480 --> 00:52:29.456
and respect women who are here.

00:52:29.456 --> 00:52:30.205
And then we'll go.

00:52:30.205 --> 00:52:31.520
We'll be evangelists, right?

00:52:31.520 --> 00:52:35.300
Like if I go and I sell my
company for a billion dollars--

00:52:35.300 --> 00:52:37.180
or maybe we never sell.

00:52:37.180 --> 00:52:39.880
We IPO, or my friends, right?

00:52:39.880 --> 00:52:43.600
Maybe my friends go and
they all get fantastic jobs,

00:52:43.600 --> 00:52:46.390
and they become VPs
and they get funded.

00:52:46.390 --> 00:52:47.630
What are we going to do?

00:52:47.630 --> 00:52:50.670
We're going to recruit
women to our companies.

00:52:50.670 --> 00:52:53.990
We're going to become angel
investors and fund them.

00:52:53.990 --> 00:52:57.210
So that's the path that
I think is interesting.

00:52:57.210 --> 00:53:00.020
Like what if we just took
the women who are here

00:53:00.020 --> 00:53:02.810
and we empowered them and
we gave them resources

00:53:02.810 --> 00:53:04.570
and we made them
really successful?

00:53:04.570 --> 00:53:06.690
And we put them on the
covers of magazines.

00:53:06.690 --> 00:53:09.050
All right, now
you're organically

00:53:09.050 --> 00:53:14.870
going to get people saying,
oh, those are role models.

00:53:14.870 --> 00:53:16.620
I kind of relate to them.

00:53:16.620 --> 00:53:20.340
So I think that you can solve
the problem organically.

00:53:20.340 --> 00:53:22.980
And there's one
more thing that I

00:53:22.980 --> 00:53:25.580
think is really interesting
that we don't talk about enough,

00:53:25.580 --> 00:53:29.030
which is Steve Jobs,
Mark Zuckerberg, all

00:53:29.030 --> 00:53:32.540
of these young white men faced
a certain kind of discrimination

00:53:32.540 --> 00:53:34.170
when they got started, too.

00:53:34.170 --> 00:53:35.890
They weren't taken seriously.

00:53:35.890 --> 00:53:38.515
They did not look like
what people thought

00:53:38.515 --> 00:53:40.420
an executive should look like.

00:53:40.420 --> 00:53:42.460
Steve Jobs faced a lot of that.

00:53:42.460 --> 00:53:45.200
And then they went and
became super successful,

00:53:45.200 --> 00:53:48.620
and now we all think that's
what a founder looks like.

00:53:48.620 --> 00:53:50.120
That's what an
executive looks like.

00:53:50.120 --> 00:53:52.800
He looks like a 19-year-old
Harvard dropout.

00:53:52.800 --> 00:53:57.190
So I'm a venture capitalist.

00:53:57.190 --> 00:53:58.670
I'm a free market feminist.

00:53:58.670 --> 00:54:05.240
I think that if we empower
women and we put them on stage

00:54:05.240 --> 00:54:08.200
and we make them successful--
and they're already awesome,

00:54:08.200 --> 00:54:14.530
so I don't think that that takes
a lot-- then all of this bias

00:54:14.530 --> 00:54:17.660
will go away on its own.

00:54:17.660 --> 00:54:19.880
That's what I think.

00:54:19.880 --> 00:54:22.810
AUDIENCE: So I have a
somewhat related question.

00:54:22.810 --> 00:54:25.164
Why is technology the
place where it's so bad?

00:54:25.164 --> 00:54:27.330
And I think there may be a
couple of tied-in things,

00:54:27.330 --> 00:54:29.810
like there are a
lot of industries--

00:54:29.810 --> 00:54:32.310
you can look at medicine,
you can look at law.

00:54:32.310 --> 00:54:33.360
They're very competitive.

00:54:33.360 --> 00:54:36.070
The women were excluded,
and then they're now

00:54:36.070 --> 00:54:38.705
like there in record numbers.

00:54:38.705 --> 00:54:40.580
And there's these graphs
where it's like, oh,

00:54:40.580 --> 00:54:42.930
the entrants looked like
this, and then women in CS

00:54:42.930 --> 00:54:46.270
sort of dies off.

00:54:46.270 --> 00:54:48.080
And a lot of the
problems we talked about,

00:54:48.080 --> 00:54:51.030
like we're talking about
these sort of basic-- I

00:54:51.030 --> 00:54:53.030
don't want to say basic
human nature things,

00:54:53.030 --> 00:54:55.600
but like societal
structural problems

00:54:55.600 --> 00:54:57.910
that aren't necessarily
unique to technology.

00:54:57.910 --> 00:55:00.029
Why is it that we're
having so much more

00:55:00.029 --> 00:55:02.070
of a problem with this
than other industries are?

00:55:02.070 --> 00:55:04.960
Or is it just because we're
so visible because technology

00:55:04.960 --> 00:55:06.094
is booming right now?

00:55:06.094 --> 00:55:07.510
ELISSA SHEVINSKY:
Well, visibility

00:55:07.510 --> 00:55:09.380
is certainly one aspect, right?

00:55:09.380 --> 00:55:12.570
Because you're seeing
these big IPOs,

00:55:12.570 --> 00:55:15.900
and there's so much money in
Silicon Valley, what happens

00:55:15.900 --> 00:55:17.740
here is of tremendous interest.

00:55:17.740 --> 00:55:21.650
And there's a lot of glamour
and fantasy in the way

00:55:21.650 --> 00:55:23.980
that the media portrays
Silicon Valley.

00:55:23.980 --> 00:55:27.630
Although you know what
coding actually looks like.

00:55:27.630 --> 00:55:30.720
It's not that exciting.

00:55:30.720 --> 00:55:33.540
So what are the
reasons why we do

00:55:33.540 --> 00:55:34.960
have these cultural problems?

00:55:34.960 --> 00:55:38.480
Because I do believe that
technology does have problems

00:55:38.480 --> 00:55:41.130
that we're not seeing
in medicine and law.

00:55:41.130 --> 00:55:43.500
I have a friend
who was a doctor,

00:55:43.500 --> 00:55:46.300
and when she was a doctor, she
was given a lot of respect.

00:55:46.300 --> 00:55:47.920
Then she became a
startup founder,

00:55:47.920 --> 00:55:49.780
and suddenly people
are questioning her.

00:55:49.780 --> 00:55:53.660
When she was a doctor, she
graduated medical school,

00:55:53.660 --> 00:55:58.700
so she had that credential,
whereas with startups, it's

00:55:58.700 --> 00:56:01.460
become very fashionable
to be the startup founder,

00:56:01.460 --> 00:56:05.510
to be a programmer,
and so we don't always

00:56:05.510 --> 00:56:07.740
take people at face value.

00:56:07.740 --> 00:56:09.800
So that's one aspect.

00:56:09.800 --> 00:56:12.010
And then there's no HR, right?

00:56:12.010 --> 00:56:15.110
You have these young
companies and young founders.

00:56:15.110 --> 00:56:18.067
They're being given millions
of dollars, or in some cases

00:56:18.067 --> 00:56:18.900
not so young, right?

00:56:18.900 --> 00:56:21.150
You have a company like
Google that's really grown up,

00:56:21.150 --> 00:56:25.890
but they're trying to maintain
this youthful culture,

00:56:25.890 --> 00:56:28.400
and the HR is different.

00:56:28.400 --> 00:56:30.280
I think that's a
big piece of it,

00:56:30.280 --> 00:56:36.950
has been intentionally trying
to have agile environments.

00:56:36.950 --> 00:56:39.910
And then you look at who
our leaders have been.

00:56:39.910 --> 00:56:42.900
If you read Paul
Graham's writings,

00:56:42.900 --> 00:56:45.880
he talks about how to
have a successful company.

00:56:45.880 --> 00:56:48.530
And he's saying that you need
to have your own culture,

00:56:48.530 --> 00:56:51.980
and you need to be able to
kind of swear and be raunchy.

00:56:51.980 --> 00:56:56.100
So some of the thought
leaders in Silicon Valley

00:56:56.100 --> 00:57:01.180
have, in their own ways,
encouraged an environment

00:57:01.180 --> 00:57:04.690
that you don't see that
same kind of encouragement

00:57:04.690 --> 00:57:07.270
in medical school.

00:57:07.270 --> 00:57:10.510
Yeah, so I'm going to stick
around for about 10 minutes

00:57:10.510 --> 00:57:12.140
and sign books.

00:57:12.140 --> 00:57:14.740
I'm really very
appreciative for Google

00:57:14.740 --> 00:57:17.090
to have this conversation.

00:57:17.090 --> 00:57:21.580
I recently gave a talk against
how the FBI and the government

00:57:21.580 --> 00:57:24.190
prosecutes hackers,
and I was really

00:57:24.190 --> 00:57:27.169
grateful to be able to give
that talk and publicize it.

00:57:27.169 --> 00:57:27.960
And I'm still here.

00:57:27.960 --> 00:57:28.785
I'm not in jail.

00:57:28.785 --> 00:57:31.160
I kind of feel that way about
giving this talk at Google.

00:57:31.160 --> 00:57:34.340
Like giving that talk
about law enforcement

00:57:34.340 --> 00:57:37.410
reflects the freedom of
speech we have in America,

00:57:37.410 --> 00:57:39.640
and giving this talk
here at Google today

00:57:39.640 --> 00:57:43.050
reflects what I believe is a
genuine commitment at Google

00:57:43.050 --> 00:57:44.310
to make things better.

00:57:44.310 --> 00:57:47.010
So please stay in touch with
me if you're interested.

00:57:47.010 --> 00:57:49.350
And one more thing--
you'll forgive the plug,

00:57:49.350 --> 00:57:50.940
but you're all tech people.

00:57:50.940 --> 00:57:55.790
I'm doing a security conference,
