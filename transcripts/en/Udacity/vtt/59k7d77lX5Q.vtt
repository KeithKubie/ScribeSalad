00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.590
There are hundreds of billions
of planets in the Milky Way, but

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:05.470
they're really hard to spot.

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:06.410
Humanity's search for

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:11.020
other earths has only yield a small
fraction of the possibilities.

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:13.370
If you're interested in
learning about exoplanets and

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:17.840
the techniques astronomers use to spot
them, keep watching after this video.

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:19.590
Anyway, that was fun.

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.390
I hoped you enjoyed learning a little
astronomy alongside JavaScript.

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:27.570
Of course you came here to learn about
Promises, the easiest technique for

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.370
handling asynchronous
work with JavaScript.

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:33.790
You learned how to wrap asynchronous
work in Promises, you chained

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:37.790
asynchronous actions together,
and you practiced error handling.

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:40.760
You experimented with
sequences of Promises, and

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.690
you tried different strategies to
convert lots of asynchronous actions

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.300
into long chains of manageable promises.

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.727
It's been a lot of fun.

00:00:49.727 --> 00:00:53.471
I want you to go out there and
use Promises to simplify your life, and

00:00:53.471 --> 00:00:56.902
you know what, don't forget to
look up every once in awhile.

00:00:56.902 --> 00:01:06.902
