I think the most important technologies
 

00:00:11.349 --> 00:00:13.500
I think the most important technologies
that we have are those that we've had

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:13.510
that we have are those that we've had
 

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:16.470

for decades already one small example of

that would be oral rehydration therapy

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720
that would be oral rehydration therapy
 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.929
that would be oral rehydration therapy
which is a simple solution of sugar salt

used everywhere in the world the answer

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:51.729
used everywhere in the world the answer
 

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:54.119
used everywhere in the world the answer
is that the management the wherewithal

00:00:54.119 --> 00:00:54.129
is that the management the wherewithal
 

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:59.219
is that the management the wherewithal

resource-poor settings so it's really a

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:16.450
resource-poor settings so it's really a
 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:18.630
resource-poor settings so it's really a
mixed perspective I think that there's a

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:18.640
mixed perspective I think that there's a
 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.389

lot to be said for new portable EKG s

00:01:21.389 --> 00:01:21.399
lot to be said for new portable EKG s
 

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:24.569

and also electronic medical records but

00:01:24.569 --> 00:01:24.579
and also electronic medical records but
 

00:01:24.579 --> 00:01:26.760
and also electronic medical records but
overall I think first we've got to

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:26.770
overall I think first we've got to
 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:28.260
overall I think first we've got to
figure out how do we roll out the

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.270
figure out how do we roll out the
 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:30.330
figure out how do we roll out the
technologies that we've got a lot of

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:30.340
technologies that we've got a lot of
 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:32.010
technologies that we've got a lot of
practice with which we know are

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:32.020
practice with which we know are
 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:33.989
practice with which we know are
extremely effective and those are

00:01:33.989 --> 00:01:33.999
extremely effective and those are
 

00:01:33.999 --> 00:01:36.209
extremely effective and those are
technologies like insecticide treated

00:01:36.209 --> 00:01:36.219
technologies like insecticide treated
 

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:39.270

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.030
interventions which have been with us at
 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:52.109
interventions which have been with us at
least a decade if not decades more than

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:52.119
least a decade if not decades more than
 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:54.929

that and yet they're not currently being

00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:54.939
that and yet they're not currently being
 

00:01:54.939 --> 00:01:57.120
that and yet they're not currently being
implemented across the board there's

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.130
implemented across the board there's
 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:59.969
implemented across the board there's
actually some new vaccines which have

00:01:59.969 --> 00:01:59.979
actually some new vaccines which have
 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:02.069
actually some new vaccines which have
just come to market and are starting to

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:02.079
just come to market and are starting to
 

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:03.649
just come to market and are starting to
be used in developing countries

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659
be used in developing countries
 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.529
be used in developing countries
including a vaccine for pneumonia

00:02:07.529 --> 00:02:07.539
including a vaccine for pneumonia
 

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:10.610
including a vaccine for pneumonia
pneumococcal vaccine which we just

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:10.620
pneumococcal vaccine which we just
 

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:13.050
pneumococcal vaccine which we just
piloted in Rwanda that's going to save

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060
piloted in Rwanda that's going to save
 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.240
piloted in Rwanda that's going to save
six thousand lives and it's just one

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250
six thousand lives and it's just one
 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:16.790
six thousand lives and it's just one
shot in the arm that kids need

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800
shot in the arm that kids need
 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.840
shot in the arm that kids need
periodically and they're going to be

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:18.850
periodically and they're going to be
 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:21.060
periodically and they're going to be
good and it's going to end up saving

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.070
good and it's going to end up saving
 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:22.470
good and it's going to end up saving
more lives than lots of

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480
more lives than lots of
 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.950
more lives than lots of
more sophisticated intervention
