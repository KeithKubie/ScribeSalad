00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:14.719
My name is Mwende Katwiwa

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:17.136
and I am a poet,

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.576
a Pan-Africanist

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.080
and a freedom fighter.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.376
I was 23 years old

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.680
when I first heard
about Reproductive Justice.

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:27.576
I was working at Women with a Vision,

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:31.656
where I learned that Reproductive Justice
was defined by Sister Song as:

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:36.096
One: A woman's right to decide
if and when she will have a baby

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.736
and the conditions
under which she will give birth.

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.336
Two: A woman's right
to decide if she will not have a baby

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.456
and her options for preventing
or ending a pregnancy.

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.616
And three: A woman's right
to parent the children she already has

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.416
in safe and healthy environments

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.136
without fear of violence

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.240
from individuals or the government.

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.000
I've always wanted to be a mother.

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.896
Growing up, I heard
all about the joys of motherhood.

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.320
I used to dream of watching my womb
weave wonder into this world.

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:08.736
See, I knew I was young.

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:09.976
But I figured,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.520
it couldn't hurt to start planning
for something so big, so early.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.400
But now,

00:01:17.319 --> 00:01:18.760
I'm 26 years old.

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.160
And I don't know if I have what it takes
to stomach motherhood in this country.

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:26.736
See, over the years, America
has taught me more about parenting

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:28.536
than any book on the subject.

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.016
It has taught me how some women
give birth to babies

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:32.936
and others to suspects.

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.536
It has taught me
that this body will birth kin

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.136
who are more likely
to be held in prison cells

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.160
than to hold college degrees.

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.456
There is something
about being Black in America

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:45.880
that has made motherhood seem

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:48.360
complicated.

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:50.696
Seem like,

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:52.896
I don't know what to do
to raise my kids right

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.256
and keep them alive.

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.816
Do I tell my son not to steal
because it is wrong,

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.160
or because they will use it
to justify his death?

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:01.016
Do I tell him

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.616
that even if he pays
for his Skittles and sweet tea

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.736
there will still be those
who will watch him

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.256
and see a criminal before child;

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.216
who will call the police
and not wait for them to come.

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:13.456
Do I even want the police to come?

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.496
Too many Sean Bells go off in my head
when I consider calling 911.

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.400
I will not take it for Oscar Grant-ed
that they will not come and kill my son.

00:02:21.919 --> 00:02:24.096
So, we may have gotten rid
of the nooses,

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.976
but I still consider it lynching
when they murder Black boys

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.320
and leave their bodies
for four hours in the sun.

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.216
As a historical reminder

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:35.856
that there is something
about being Black in America

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.776
that has made motherhood sound

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.160
like mourning.

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:41.736
Sound like one morning I could wake up

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.816
and see my son as a repeat
of last week's story.

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.736
Sound like I could wake up and realize

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.256
the death of my daughter
wouldn't even be newsworthy.

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.496
So you can't tell me that Sandra Bland
is the only Black woman

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:55.096
whose violence deserves
more than our silence.

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.736
What about our other
dark-skinned daughters in distress

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.536
whose deaths we have yet to remember?

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:00.776
What about our children

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:03.776
whose lives don't fit neatly
between the lives of your genders?

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:05.936
See, apparently,
nothing is a great protector

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:08.240
if you come out of a body
that looks like this.

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:12.616
See, there is something
about being Black in America

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.576
that has made motherhood sound

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.760
like something I'm not sure
I look forward to.

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:23.536
I've written too many poems
about dead Black children to be naÃ¯ve

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.920
about the fact that there could one day
be a poem written about my kids.

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.720
But I do not want to be a mother
who gave birth to poems.

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:35.056
I do not want a stanza for a son

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:37.256
nor a line for a little girl

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:40.280
nor a footnote for a child
who doesn't fit into this world.

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:42.176
No.

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.416
I do not want children
who will live forever

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:46.176
in the pages of poetry,

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.336
yet can't seem to outlive

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:49.576
me.

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:56.120
(Applause)

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:00.976
I was invited to the TEDWomen conference

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.200
to perform a poem.

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:06.760
But for me, poetry is not
about art and performance.

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.560
It is a form of protest.

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:11.896
Yesterday,

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:13.576
during rehearsal,

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:15.656
I was told that there had been

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:18.920
two to three recent TED Talks
about Black Lives Matter.

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:23.456
That maybe I should cut down my TED Talk

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:26.080
so it could "just" be
about Reproductive Justice.

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:29.656
But that poem and this talk

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.760
is fundamentally about
my inability to separate the two.

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:35.136
I was 21 years old --

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:42.160
(Applause)

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:46.280
I was 21 years old
when Trayvon Martin was murdered.

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:51.056
Trayvon Martin, a 17-year-old Black boy,

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:52.616
a Black child,

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:54.176
reminded me

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:55.736
reminded us

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:58.640
how little this nation
actually values Black life.

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:01.976
The hashtag #BlackLivesMatter

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.456
became the most recognized call

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:06.976
for Black people and our children

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.856
to live in safe environments
and healthy communities

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:11.216
without fear

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:14.600
from violence from individuals
or the state or government.

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:17.456
Months later,

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:19.656
when George Zimmerman
was not held responsible

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:21.736
for murdering Trayvon Martin,

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:23.296
I heard Sybrina Fulton,

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:24.880
Trayvon Martin's mother, speak.

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:29.216
Her testimony so deeply impacted me

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:31.240
that I found myself constantly asking,

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:35.096
what would it mean to mother
in the United Stated of America

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:36.320
in this skin?

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:38.856
What does motherhood really mean,

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:41.016
when for so many who look like me

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:43.040
it is synonymous with mourning?

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:46.696
Without realizing it,

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:49.856
I had begun to link
the Reproductive Justice framework

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:51.720
and the Movement for Black Lives.

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:54.896
As I learned more
about Reproductive Justice

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:56.296
at Women With A Vision,

00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:00.056
and as I continued to be active
in the Movement for Black Lives,

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:03.880
I found myself wanting others
to see and feel these similarities.

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:06.776
I found myself asking:

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:09.576
Whose job is it in times like this

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:12.760
to connect ideas realities and people?

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:16.856
I want to dedicate this talk and that poem

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:18.320
to Constance Malcolm.

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:21.696
She is the mother of Ramarley Graham

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:23.296
who was another Black child

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:25.000
who was murdered before their time.

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:28.016
She reminded me once over dinner,

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:30.296
as I was struggling to write that poem,

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:32.216
that it is the artist's job

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:34.936
to unearth stories that people try to bury

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:37.440
with shovels of complacency and time.

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:40.136
Recently,

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:41.400
Toni Morrison wrote,

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:44.136
"In times of dread,

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:46.560
artists must never choose
to remain silent.

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:49.536
There is no time for self-pity,

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:50.920
no room for fear."

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:54.136
Yesterday, during rehearsal,

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:55.576
when I was told that I should

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:58.976
"maybe cut the Black Lives Matter
portion from my talk,"

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:00.880
I found myself fearful for a moment.

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:04.336
Fearful that again
our stories were being denied

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:06.480
the very stages
they deserve to be told on.

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:10.280
And then I remembered
the words I had just spoken.

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:13.176
"In times of dread,

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:16.120
artists must never choose
to remain silent.

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:19.336
There is no time for self-pity.

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:26.120
(Applause)

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:30.216
There is no time for self-pity.

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:31.840
And no room for fear."

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:34.656
And I have made my choice.

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:36.580
And I am always choosing.

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:38.576
Thank you.

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:45.080
(Applause)
