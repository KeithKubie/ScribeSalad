00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.430
I think there are three statements where we can certainly say by now that they are true.

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:08.890
We know that every problem that is in P is also contained in NP.

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:12.070
This is why we drew the picture like this. So, that's obvious.

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:15.810
If every problem in NP is also contained in P

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:19.200
that would mean that we have a polynomial time algorithm for

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.310
vertex cover, independent set, and clique.

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:23.090
We do not know that to be true yet.

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:28.090
Of course, we also don't know it to be false, but it's not something we can make a statement about.

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:31.110
And since we can't make a statement about this here,

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:34.890
we can also not to say that P and NP are equivalent or basically the same.

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.960
Now, the fourth one is probably the most subjective one so of course

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.440
it seems like NP should contain more problems than P

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.730
simply for the reason that non-determinism is just so powerful that

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:54.290
we would not expect that every problem that can be solved in polynomial time using non-determinism

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:57.830
can also be solved in polynomial time on a deterministic RAM

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:00.410
if you just think about how much time our simulation took

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:03.140
and of course it might not be the best possible simulation

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:05.200
but I think it's highly unlikely.

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:10.190
We can't be sure, but that's why I wrote here it seems like NP should contain more problems

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:13.750
and not stated it as a fact so that I can make a check mark here.

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.860
Now, finally, vertex cover, independent set, and clique, if we knew that they were in P

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:19.490
we would have a polynomial time algorithm.

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:21.650
Can't really make that statement right now.

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:25.500
And finally, vertex cover, independent set, and clique, yes they are in NP.

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.930
We show that they can be solved in polynomial time

00:01:27.930 --> 99:59:59.000
if we have the wonderful and magic if better function available.
