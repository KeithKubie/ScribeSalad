00:00:08.046 --> 00:00:13.766
&gt;&gt;You have a visitor today.

00:00:13.766 --> 00:00:13.886
Awesome.

00:00:14.046 --> 00:00:17.216
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Any class, especially
one dedicated to history and culture,

00:00:17.546 --> 00:00:20.246
can benefit from an encounter
with a visiting expert.

00:00:22.646 --> 00:00:23.746
&gt;&gt;My name's Saaduuts.

00:00:24.586 --> 00:00:25.956
I come from the Haida Tribe.

00:00:27.086 --> 00:00:29.166
I come from the Edenshaw family.

00:00:29.166 --> 00:00:32.676
&gt;&gt;Narrator: For many of these
students at Seattle's AS-1 school,

00:00:32.926 --> 00:00:36.156
interacting with this Native
American would teach them more

00:00:36.156 --> 00:00:38.416
than just a lesson in history.

00:00:39.216 --> 00:00:41.646
&gt;&gt;Saaduuts: The chiefs were
allowed masks-- to wear masks.

00:00:43.046 --> 00:00:46.446
Other people cannot wear masks
because they want to or you have

00:00:46.446 --> 00:00:49.566
to have permission, and it's
not like Halloween or anything.

00:00:49.566 --> 00:00:52.466
We put the mask on so we
could see what's in the wood.

00:00:52.976 --> 00:00:55.636
&gt;&gt;Narrator: A master carver
from the Alaskan village

00:00:55.636 --> 00:00:58.486
of Hydaburg, Saaduuts had a vision.

00:00:58.486 --> 00:01:03.646
&gt;&gt;So, when we finish this, it
should be able to last 100 years.

00:01:04.396 --> 00:01:08.566
&gt;&gt;He would transform a six-ton cedar
log into a traditional voyaging canoe

00:01:08.566 --> 00:01:11.466
with help from the
seventh-graders from AS-1.

00:01:11.666 --> 00:01:14.626
As part of their history
and culture class,

00:01:14.626 --> 00:01:18.036
the students would spend two
school-day mornings each month

00:01:18.256 --> 00:01:21.556
and volunteer on weekends to work
on the canoe at Seattle Center

00:01:21.556 --> 00:01:25.756
for Wooden Boats in a project that
would eventually span three years.

00:01:27.586 --> 00:01:31.866
&gt;&gt;The biggest challenge was
for the children to learn

00:01:32.566 --> 00:01:37.996
about creating something from a
dream or a vision into reality

00:01:38.336 --> 00:01:41.656
and taking time to
live through a process.

00:01:42.256 --> 00:01:45.796
&gt;&gt;I'm going to have you start
here, and this is in here.

00:01:46.336 --> 00:01:51.296
&gt;&gt;That if you don't give up and
you keep on working every day

00:01:51.296 --> 00:01:54.756
in a disciplined fashion
and together as community

00:01:54.756 --> 00:01:57.356
that you can complete
something absolutely wonderful.

00:01:57.966 --> 00:01:59.866
&gt;&gt;I never doubted the kids.

00:01:59.936 --> 00:02:01.986
The teaching's about
having confidence,

00:02:02.386 --> 00:02:03.926
not about ever doubting them.

00:02:04.416 --> 00:02:09.716
And I let them use all the tools,
heavy, the sledgehammers, wedges,

00:02:10.046 --> 00:02:12.446
so that they could
meet the challenges.

00:02:12.446 --> 00:02:18.396
&gt;&gt;It's really exciting to
be able to say yes to kids.

00:02:19.196 --> 00:02:22.336
Yes, you can go out in the boat.

00:02:22.336 --> 00:02:24.046
Yes, you can steer the boat.

00:02:24.556 --> 00:02:28.636
Yes, you can hold this sharp
tool and cut wood with it

00:02:28.776 --> 00:02:31.306
on a canoe or on a pond boat.

00:02:31.306 --> 00:02:34.576
I've seen the kids come down
from Alternative School 1.

00:02:34.636 --> 00:02:38.146
Sometimes they might be a bit
tentative in the early part

00:02:38.146 --> 00:02:40.106
of the morning, but then
they start getting into it

00:02:40.106 --> 00:02:42.456
and they start becoming really
engaged with each other,

00:02:42.666 --> 00:02:44.436
and they collaborate and they laugh.

00:02:44.896 --> 00:02:47.006
And when they get something
accomplished,

00:02:47.206 --> 00:02:49.806
there's just a great
shine in their smile.

00:02:50.336 --> 00:02:52.616
&gt;&gt;And then when you make your stroke,

00:02:53.016 --> 00:02:56.136
you'll come back and
rest it on your lap.

00:02:56.136 --> 00:03:00.586
&gt;&gt;Former AS-1 Principal Ron Snyder
helped launch the canoe project.

00:03:00.996 --> 00:03:06.186
&gt;&gt;It's important as warriors to look
good, because that's who you are

00:03:06.186 --> 00:03:07.516
when you paddle that canoe.

00:03:07.716 --> 00:03:13.046
The canoe us a historical vehicle,
and it often went on adventures,

00:03:13.296 --> 00:03:17.586
and you will present yourself
as warriors, as a proud people.

00:03:18.596 --> 00:03:22.146
&gt;&gt;An advocate of expeditionary
learning, Snyder believes

00:03:22.146 --> 00:03:25.806
that there's no substitute
for hands-on lessons.

00:03:26.136 --> 00:03:28.326
&gt;&gt;Experience-based education sticks.

00:03:29.296 --> 00:03:34.596
You really find out not about
some twisted figment of history

00:03:35.376 --> 00:03:39.876
but about you, yourself and your
relationship to your history.

00:03:40.516 --> 00:03:50.336
&gt;&gt;Saaduut: [singing]

00:03:50.836 --> 00:03:57.226
&gt;&gt;They chose to tap their paddles
in synchronized sound motion

00:03:57.816 --> 00:04:02.976
to what Saaduuts was singing on
the dock as the Haida paddle song.

00:04:03.516 --> 00:04:06.236
&gt;&gt;Saaduut: [singing]

00:04:06.736 --> 00:04:09.146
&gt;&gt;That came from their
heart, from their rhythm.

00:04:09.466 --> 00:04:14.366
They really got it, how sharp they
looked, how powerful they were,

00:04:14.366 --> 00:04:17.896
and there was a tremendous
aura of pride in the canoe.

00:04:17.996 --> 00:04:22.216
&gt;&gt;Tell me what it felt
like to paddle.

00:04:22.576 --> 00:04:27.006
&gt;&gt;It was really moving, because you
were all paddling at the same time

00:04:27.006 --> 00:04:31.446
and then when you're coming back, we
would paddle and then hit our paddles

00:04:31.446 --> 00:04:33.806
against the side when we rested.

00:04:34.116 --> 00:04:39.466
And there was this rhythm to it and
it sounded almost like music, and--

00:04:39.466 --> 00:04:41.906
&gt;&gt;As the canoe neared
completion, teachers,

00:04:42.066 --> 00:04:44.866
parents and students
prepared for a trip to Alaska

00:04:45.266 --> 00:04:47.606
to present their canoe
to the Haida Tribe.

00:04:48.156 --> 00:04:52.046
&gt;&gt;So, you're all going to be able to
paddle it, we hope, but you can't do

00:04:52.046 --> 00:04:53.976
that unless you pass the float
test and the capsize test.

00:04:54.516 --> 00:05:03.566
&gt;&gt;All: [singing]

00:05:04.066 --> 00:05:07.236
&gt;&gt;In April of 2004 the AS-1
group traveled to the village

00:05:07.236 --> 00:05:09.286
of Hydaburg in southeastern Alaska.

00:05:09.286 --> 00:05:13.896
In culmination of their
three-year effort,

00:05:14.106 --> 00:05:18.666
they paddled their canoe
ashore and presented it

00:05:18.786 --> 00:05:21.976
as a gift to the community.

00:05:22.086 --> 00:05:24.936
&gt;&gt;It made my heart cry with
joy to see the connection,

00:05:24.936 --> 00:05:27.776
the cultural connection
when my people are standing

00:05:27.776 --> 00:05:30.116
on the beach waiting
to receive the canoe.

00:05:30.116 --> 00:05:38.256
It touched everybody on both
sides of the connection,

00:05:38.256 --> 00:05:39.976
and that's what the
whole thing is about.

00:05:40.136 --> 00:05:42.916
&gt;&gt;I just loved the idea that the kids
could study Northwest Native canoe

00:05:42.916 --> 00:05:46.836
culture and the importance of the
canoe, not just from textbooks,

00:05:46.836 --> 00:05:51.286
not just from lectures
but actually meet people,

00:05:51.286 --> 00:05:53.916
get into the culture,
produce a canoe.

00:05:53.916 --> 00:05:57.106
So that's really an
integrated form of learning.

00:05:57.176 --> 00:06:01.756
&gt;&gt;And if everybody lift together
and help, it's going to work good.

00:06:01.756 --> 00:06:02.506
No rushing.

00:06:02.506 --> 00:06:05.926
If there's anything-- everybody
set it down together, all right?

00:06:06.886 --> 00:06:09.576
One, two, three.

00:06:09.756 --> 00:06:11.586
Hoo. Hoo.

00:06:11.586 --> 00:06:19.536
&gt;&gt;In 2005 the AS-1 community carved
a second canoe and donated it

00:06:19.536 --> 00:06:20.896
to another Alaskan village,

00:06:21.436 --> 00:06:25.186
and Seattle's cultural
carving connection continues

00:06:25.416 --> 00:06:27.726
with two more canoes
now under construction.

00:06:28.496 --> 00:06:32.016
&gt;&gt;It was just so great to
be part of this spirit,

00:06:32.016 --> 00:06:34.326
where everybody was coming
together, creating this thing.

00:06:34.326 --> 00:06:36.776
We just don't get much of an
opportunity to do things like that

00:06:36.896 --> 00:06:43.226
in the world today, and so it
was-- it went beyond the school.

00:06:43.666 --> 00:06:46.696
It stretched out into
the bigger community,

00:06:46.696 --> 00:06:48.386
so it was a really,
really special thing.

00:06:48.386 --> 00:06:52.006
&gt;&gt;Through the eyes of the child,
change will come if we teach him,

00:06:52.006 --> 00:06:53.736
if we take the time to teach him.

00:06:54.146 --> 00:06:55.856
They're hungry for this new way.

00:06:56.216 --> 00:06:57.886
It's a new but old way.

00:06:58.181 --> 00:07:00.181
&gt;&gt;All: [cheers]

00:07:00.346 --> 00:07:03.776
&gt;&gt;We can't keep them on the
side and expect them to learn.

00:07:04.116 --> 00:07:09.836
They have to have hands on, be part
of it, and too much of the things

00:07:09.836 --> 00:07:13.246
that are going on now is
we're cutting too many things

00:07:13.246 --> 00:07:16.686
out of the children's life:
working with their hands

00:07:16.686 --> 00:07:18.896
and their mind and their spirit.

00:07:19.516 --> 00:07:25.546
&gt;&gt;All: [singing]

00:07:26.046 --> 00:07:29.706
&gt;&gt;We could tell the story,
but if they practice the story

00:07:29.706 --> 00:07:33.696
and do a hands-on, it's a living
story, and that's why they want

00:07:33.696 --> 00:07:35.756
to be here and be part of it.

00:07:40.226 --> 00:07:42.606
