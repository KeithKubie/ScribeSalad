Okay, welcome back. Let's finish coding this off.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
In our original description of delta debugging,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
we have to increase the granularity at this point.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
That is, n becomes 2n but must not become longer

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
than the current input we're working on.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Our working input here is s and must not become bigger than the length of s.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
However, if this works we simply double it.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
If we have reached the total length of s,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
and then we return the simplified input.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Here again we have the HTML input for which the binary search simplification

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
didn't simplify enough.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Let's see how delta debugging fares instead.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
We click on Run.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
You see the output now is simply ,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
showing that delta debugging has managed to really minimized everything away in here.
