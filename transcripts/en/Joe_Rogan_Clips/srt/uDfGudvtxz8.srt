1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,420
But some stuff's real out.
Well,

2
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:07,410
I love the way you communicate this
because it takes into consideration human

3
00:00:07,411 --> 00:00:12,240
nature. And like I loved Dawkins.
He's fantastic. I think he's very,

4
00:00:12,241 --> 00:00:15,780
very, very valuable. But he
likes to call people idiots.

5
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:19,590
And the problem with that is people
go, fuck you. You're an idiot.

6
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:24,770
Like is a natural inclination when you
insult people to argue back and to sort

7
00:00:27,061 --> 00:00:30,540
of dig their heels in. Yeah.
And a, you don't do that.

8
00:00:30,541 --> 00:00:31,980
And I think that's very important.

9
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:36,060
And I think that it kind guy like Dawkins
just gets frustrated from all these

10
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:38,010
years of debates with
people who are uneducated,

11
00:00:38,011 --> 00:00:41,180
are saying ridiculous things and
he's a bit of a curmudgeon, you know,

12
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:43,360
when he seems to be softening
as he's getting older. Well,

13
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:47,100
he's an evolutionary biologist and
that's the, the front line in some sense,

14
00:00:47,101 --> 00:00:48,740
isn't it? Yes, that is. Yeah. I mean,

15
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:51,690
you think about particle physics is
that you don't get a lot of shit because

16
00:00:51,691 --> 00:00:56,510
people don't understand
what you're talking about.
Evolutionary your biologies.

17
00:00:56,540 --> 00:01:00,630
Right. That so I understand
his frustration. Oh, I do too.

18
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:05,460
Having said that, you know, I've kind of
softened a bit over the years actually,

19
00:01:05,461 --> 00:01:08,280
because now I think at this point,

20
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:12,810
both in the u s actually and in Britain
and in some other countries, we are a,

21
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:16,440
an a point, you've sort of alluded
to it, where everybody's angry,

22
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:19,380
there's a lot of anger and a lot
of it is justified by the way,

23
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:22,050
who could talk about that, you know,
income inequality and all those things.

24
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:23,880
So it's justified anger.

25
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:29,010
But it seems to me that there are people
of goodwill who need to band together

26
00:01:29,011 --> 00:01:30,210
to diffuse the anger.

27
00:01:30,211 --> 00:01:33,670
Now Society's otherwise we won't have
countries like the United States. Yes.

28
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,080
As United States, cause it's United and
everybody, and you've got the United,

29
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:38,520
the American flag there.
You know,

30
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:43,020
there's a sense of belonging and identity
and togetherness in a country which

31
00:01:43,021 --> 00:01:47,670
you've got to preserve. And so
I've stopped actually, um, picking,

32
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,570
I used to, for example, quite
enjoy picking fights with
Deepak Chopra on Twitter.

33
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,750
You know, and it's just
for me to laugh, you know,

34
00:01:54,751 --> 00:01:59,400
and you just do it and he says some crazy
stuff, then he's end. But I've sort of,

35
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:00,900
I've stopped doing it going well,

36
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:06,140
but relative to some of
the other people is a,

37
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:09,690
he's someone who means it means well.
Yes,

38
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:12,870
I don't agree with virtually
anything he says. However,

39
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:17,670
he's a well meaning person. And so I've
started trying to seek common ground now.

40
00:02:17,671 --> 00:02:22,240
That's why I get, for example, gave a
talk to the bishop's asked me to call me.

41
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:26,730
I don't agree with them on the framework,
their theological framework,

42
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:29,100
but they mean well, most of them. Yeah.

43
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:33,150
So I think seeking consensus and
diffusion, anger, as you said,

44
00:02:33,151 --> 00:02:35,250
is it is incumbent on all of us,

45
00:02:35,251 --> 00:02:37,530
especially people like us
who have a public voice.

46
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:41,820
We need to diffuse some of
this anger because otherwise
it will consume everyone.

47
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:42,991
Yes.
I've,

48
00:02:42,991 --> 00:02:47,820
I've tried very hard to evolve in
that respect and just get better at

49
00:02:47,821 --> 00:02:51,000
communicating ideas and get better at
understanding how people receive those

50
00:02:51,001 --> 00:02:54,270
ideas. And I think that's, it's there's,

51
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:58,550
it's easy to get lazy and
to insult and to yeah.

52
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:02,650
And he's fine. He's fine. Yeah. Well,
especially me. I mean, I'm a comedian.

53
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:04,840
That's part of what I do is insult people.
Yeah.

54
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:08,500
But I use it funny for humor.

55
00:03:08,501 --> 00:03:11,200
I want to entertain people.
That's the whole idea behind it.

56
00:03:11,201 --> 00:03:15,610
But I think in terms of like discussing
ideas especially that are so personal to

57
00:03:15,611 --> 00:03:18,520
people like religion. I've, I've uh,

58
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:22,710
I've reexamined the way I interpret
these ideas and the way I owe.

59
00:03:22,711 --> 00:03:27,600
I talk about these things. Yeah.
That's uh, it's interesting. There's a,

60
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:31,240
I did a BBC program at age to,
I was asked to do it on the,

61
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:34,380
this thing called the
wreath lunches at the BBC.

62
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,240
The BBC had done to his 1952,
I think it was.

63
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:42,730
And Robert Oppenheimer did them in
53. And it was, it's fascinating.

64
00:03:42,731 --> 00:03:44,290
You can get the transcripts online,

65
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:48,370
they're free and you can get one recording
of the five they taped over the other

66
00:03:48,371 --> 00:03:51,160
four. Can you believe
it? Why they raised them?

67
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:54,450
Because they wanted to tape for
something else. It's just unbelievable.

68
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:59,330
But one of them exist often home are
given these latches. Oh my God. I know.

69
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:04,570
But you can read thick from Katie by
more tapes and virtual veteran muscle

70
00:04:05,681 --> 00:04:09,010
didn't do the, they tapes
over them. Bertrand Russell's

71
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:15,310
cause tape was so expensive,
but he talks crazy.

72
00:04:16,210 --> 00:04:18,880
But it's brilliant. It's called
science in the common understanding.

73
00:04:19,210 --> 00:04:21,520
And they weren't very well received
because he thought it was going to talk

74
00:04:21,521 --> 00:04:22,720
about the Manhattan project.

75
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:26,020
So they thought it was going to talk about
the atom bomb. You know, cause he was,

76
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,180
he ran it basically.
But you didn't,

77
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:31,390
you talked about how
thinking like a scientist,

78
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:36,850
which means thinking in the way that
nature forces you to think can be valuable

79
00:04:37,211 --> 00:04:41,350
in other areas. And it's a, that's an
insight in itself. The great thing,

80
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:46,090
the unique thing about science, there's
nature forces you to think like that.

81
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,970
You can't have an opinion.
Can I have an opinion about gravity?

82
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,590
We jumped to build and you can
hit the ground. That's it. Yeah.

83
00:04:52,591 --> 00:04:57,370
It doesn't matter what your opinion
is. And he said, so if you think about,

84
00:04:57,371 --> 00:05:01,790
for example, quantum mechanics. So,
uh, sometimes you think of as Pascal,

85
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,700
like an electron,
sometimes it has to,

86
00:05:03,701 --> 00:05:07,900
it's a point like object may behave
like a little Billy a bowl thing,

87
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:09,340
the pool ball that bounces around,

88
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,190
but sometimes it behaves
like an extended thing,

89
00:05:12,191 --> 00:05:16,840
like a wavy thing and nature forces you
to hold both ideas in your head at the

90
00:05:16,841 --> 00:05:21,841
same time in order to get a complete
picture of the object there a description

91
00:05:22,061 --> 00:05:25,960
of an electron. And he said that's the
valuable thing about quantum mechanics.

92
00:05:25,961 --> 00:05:27,880
You know,
unless you're doing electronics,

93
00:05:27,881 --> 00:05:30,640
I'm inventing lasers and you
don't need to know this stuff.

94
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:32,920
But if you want to learn how to think,

95
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:37,630
it's valuable to be forced
to hold different ideas in
your head at the same time.

96
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:41,890
It's really teaching you not to be an
absolutist straight teaching you the

97
00:05:41,891 --> 00:05:44,350
example he uses his,
cause he was,

98
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:47,350
I think he has had problems with McCarthy
and all those things. Didn't he say,

99
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:50,650
you think he's still, he's writing in
the 50s. So he said you can either be,

100
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:51,910
you can be a communist,

101
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:56,710
which in his definition would be that
you think the needs of the many outweigh

102
00:05:56,711 --> 00:06:00,260
the needs of the few. Right. So say
society is all that matters. Oh,

103
00:06:00,261 --> 00:06:04,070
it could be a libertarian or right on
the far conservative and where you think

104
00:06:04,071 --> 00:06:07,070
that the individual is the only
thing that matters then that's it.

105
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:10,430
But actually of course,
to have a function in society,

106
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:14,090
you need a mixture of the two and
we can wait it one way or the other,

107
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:17,930
but you need to hold both ideas in
your head at the same time. And that's,

108
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:22,160
he said that one of the most valuable
things about science because it forces you

109
00:06:22,161 --> 00:06:24,470
into modes of thought that are valuable.

110
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,120
And that's what we're talking about here,

111
00:06:26,121 --> 00:06:31,020
which is one of the absolute
positions are always, uh, uh,

112
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:34,900
uh, just uh, a blinkered sort of
subsets of what's actually happening.

113
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:38,990
You can't understand the world
by being an extremist. Yeah.

114
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:41,330
You got to hold all
these views in your head.

115
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:47,230
Well that I find that so often on this
podcast because I talk with people I

116
00:06:47,841 --> 00:06:52,160
agree with and disagree with and I always
try to put myself in the head of the

117
00:06:52,161 --> 00:06:53,330
person that I disagree with.

118
00:06:53,331 --> 00:06:58,331
I will always try to figure out how
they're coming to those conclusions are

119
00:06:58,551 --> 00:07:01,520
where they're coming from.
Yeah. And I think it's so,

120
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:04,610
it's so important to
not be married to ideas.

121
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:08,180
I got a conversation with
someone about this and they said,

122
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:12,470
sometimes you change your opinions
a lot. I go, yeah, I do. I do.

123
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:17,090
Because if he's a bad thing, I'm
flip flopping. I'm not a politician.

124
00:07:17,091 --> 00:07:21,770
Like I'm not flip flopping. I'm thinking,
yeah, I'm not sure. I'm not sure. Like I,

125
00:07:21,771 --> 00:07:25,550
I will have one opinion on a thing,
whether it's a controversial thing,

126
00:07:25,551 --> 00:07:30,050
like universal basic income. I'll change
my mind 100% in two weeks. Yeah. I'll go,

127
00:07:30,051 --> 00:07:32,150
no, no, no, no. Now I think
it's probably a good idea. Yeah.

128
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,120
And then I'll go back and
forth. No, no, no, no, no.

129
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:38,300
People need about eight to his cruise.
It seems they need motivation. They need.

130
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:41,390
And I don't know, I bounce
around with these things. Yeah.

131
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:46,460
But I've tried really hard as I've gotten
older to have less absolute opinions.

132
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:48,860
Yeah. Yeah. Uh, Richard Fineman,

133
00:07:48,861 --> 00:07:53,420
another great physicist or a similar
essay at a similar time to Oppenheimer.

134
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:56,870
And he also worked on the
Manhattan project and it's
called the value of science.

135
00:07:56,871 --> 00:08:01,300
And I think that was 1955 and
they both shared actually, uh, uh,

136
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:02,480
a surprise.

137
00:08:02,481 --> 00:08:06,020
I think that they were still alive
because they thought that the power they'd

138
00:08:06,021 --> 00:08:09,620
given to the politicians,
the atom bomb would destroy everything.

139
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,350
They didn't think that the political
system would control it. And he did.

140
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:16,370
So that's an emerging malleable thing.
Yeah, we're still here. But in, in,

141
00:08:16,371 --> 00:08:20,120
in that essay, he said the, um, the, the,

142
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:24,680
the most valuable thing about science
is the realization that we don't know.

143
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,113
And he said,

144
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:31,130
he said in that statement equals signs
a satisfactory philosophy of ignorance,

145
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:35,150
by the way. And he said in that statement
is the open door, the open channel,

146
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:38,210
he called it.
So if we want to make progress,

147
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:41,600
we have to understand that
we don't know everything.

148
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:45,800
And we have to leave things to future
generations and we can be uncertain and we

149
00:08:45,801 --> 00:08:50,420
can change our minds. And he said that
that's, that is a great last line.

150
00:08:50,421 --> 00:08:51,440
I can't exactly what he says,

151
00:08:51,441 --> 00:08:55,500
but he said it's something like it's our
duty as scientists to communicate value

152
00:08:55,501 --> 00:08:59,550
of uncertainty and the value of freedom
of thoughts to all future generations.

153
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:02,160
That's the point.
That's what freedom of thought means.

154
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:06,400
Freedom of thought means the freedom
to change your mind. In fact said.

155
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:08,580
That's what democracy is.
If you think about it,

156
00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:11,340
democracy is a trial and error system.
So it's the,

157
00:09:11,341 --> 00:09:16,020
it's the admission that we don't know
how to do. It therefore will change.

158
00:09:16,021 --> 00:09:19,470
Every four years will change the president
or every eight years will change the

159
00:09:19,471 --> 00:09:22,980
president. Why? Because the president
who doesn't know how to do it.

160
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:27,300
So someone that's there will be someone
better that comes along and then someone

161
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:28,380
worse and someone better,

162
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:32,430
but it's a trial and error system and
he's right and it is right that that is

163
00:09:32,431 --> 00:09:34,200
the open door.
That's the,

164
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:38,110
that's the road to progress is
certainly better than humility. Yeah.

165
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:41,400
One of the things that I love so much
about Bertrand Russell and about Fineman

166
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:45,360
was how human they were. There were
very human mean fireman, like the play,

167
00:09:45,361 --> 00:09:50,250
the bongos and chasing girls. And
Bertrand Russell was addicted to tobacco.

168
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:54,270
He would talk about how he
wouldn't fly unless he could smoke.

169
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:59,070
Like he had to get us was back when they
had smoking sections on airplanes and

170
00:09:59,071 --> 00:10:02,220
he had his pipe and he just
refused to fly without tobacco.

171
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:04,290
He couldn't imagine being without tobacco.

172
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:06,210
And like that's so strange for the Joe,

173
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:11,430
a brilliant guide to be addicted to such
a gross thing. Yeah, you're, you're right.

174
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:16,320
Because I think these, these are
people that found existence joyous.

175
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:18,930
Right? They wanted to know,
they just wanted to know stuff.

176
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:22,650
They didn't want to know
everything because you can't
know everything. Right. Um,

177
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:23,480
you know that I'm,

178
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:27,330
I suppose that's what you think about
what the job of a scientist is. It's to,

179
00:10:27,331 --> 00:10:32,010
it's to stand on the edge of the known
because you're a research scientist.

180
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:35,210
So if there's nothing to know,
then you've got no job. Right.

181
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:39,320
So you have to be naturally
comfortable with not knowing. And I,

182
00:10:39,321 --> 00:10:42,220
if there's one thing I
really do think we was,

183
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:45,450
how do we begin to patch our
countries back off again?

184
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:49,560
One of the reasons I think in education
is to teach people the value of

185
00:10:49,561 --> 00:10:54,360
uncertainty,
of not knowing it is not weak to not know.

186
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,200
It's actually natural not to know.

187
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:02,460
And that's one the problem
is with religion is to say
that you know when you do

188
00:11:02,461 --> 00:11:06,690
not, or to say that you have absolute
truth and absolute knowledge of something.

189
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:08,830
Yeah. When it can't really exist. Yeah.
