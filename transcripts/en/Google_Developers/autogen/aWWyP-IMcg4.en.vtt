like an IP in one place an IV in a

00:18:04.509 --> 00:18:04.519
like an IP in one place an IV in a
 

00:18:04.519 --> 00:18:05.470
like an IP in one place an IV in a
different place and it might actually be

00:18:05.470 --> 00:18:05.480
different place and it might actually be
 

00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:08.049

user across all devices for you so the
 

00:18:17.450 --> 00:18:20.139
user across all devices for you so the
way we've done that is we've a coupla

00:18:20.139 --> 00:18:20.149
way we've done that is we've a coupla
 

00:18:20.149 --> 00:18:22.240

mented cross-device single sign it what

00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:22.250
mented cross-device single sign it what
 

00:18:22.250 --> 00:18:24.940
mented cross-device single sign it what
that means is if a user signs in with

00:18:24.940 --> 00:18:24.950
that means is if a user signs in with

00:23:25.210 --> 00:23:28.260
right so one is when a user does a
connection with Google+ right they have

00:23:28.260 --> 00:23:28.270
connection with Google+ right they have
 

00:23:28.270 --> 00:23:29.840
connection with Google+ right they have
access to all the Google+ friends

00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:29.850
access to all the Google+ friends
 

00:23:29.850 --> 00:23:32.940

there's also the contacts API right from

00:23:32.940 --> 00:23:32.950
there's also the contacts API right from
 

00:23:32.950 --> 00:23:35.160
there's also the contacts API right from
Android so you can also get the contacts

00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:35.170
Android so you can also get the contacts
 

00:23:35.170 --> 00:23:37.920

API and get a list of a user's friends
 

00:23:37.930 --> 00:23:40.890
API and get a list of a user's friends
that way too once you have a list of the

00:23:40.890 --> 00:23:40.900
that way too once you have a list of the
 

00:23:40.900 --> 00:23:44.070
that way too once you have a list of the
users friends and you prompt the user to

00:23:44.070 --> 00:23:44.080
users friends and you prompt the user to
 

00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:48.650

people's friends names in the to field
of a share box from google plus so you

00:23:59.970 --> 00:23:59.980
of a share box from google plus so you
 

00:23:59.980 --> 00:24:01.650
of a share box from google plus so you
can do that as a developer right so you

00:24:01.650 --> 00:24:01.660
can do that as a developer right so you
 

00:24:01.660 --> 00:24:02.880
can do that as a developer right so you
could grab

00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:02.890
could grab
 

00:24:02.890 --> 00:24:04.860
could grab
you can even get a rank ordered list of

00:24:04.860 --> 00:24:04.870
you can even get a rank ordered list of
 

00:24:04.870 --> 00:24:07.590
you can even get a rank ordered list of
friends based on affinity from google

00:24:07.590 --> 00:24:07.600
friends based on affinity from google

into your app now it's also am going to

00:25:32.550 --> 00:25:32.560
into your app now it's also am going to
 

00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:33.660
into your app now it's also am going to
stop there and then we'll talk about one

00:25:33.660 --> 00:25:33.670
stop there and then we'll talk about one
 

00:25:33.670 --> 00:25:34.890
stop there and then we'll talk about one
or feature questions on this one before

00:25:34.890 --> 00:25:34.900
or feature questions on this one before
 

00:25:34.900 --> 00:25:38.280
or feature questions on this one before
I go on because this one I know is

00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:38.290
I go on because this one I know is
 

00:25:38.290 --> 00:25:41.010
I go on because this one I know is
nuanced but very powerful yep the

00:25:41.010 --> 00:25:41.020
nuanced but very powerful yep the
 

00:25:41.020 --> 00:25:43.020
nuanced but very powerful yep the
question was is it possible to determine

00:25:43.020 --> 00:25:43.030
question was is it possible to determine
 

00:25:43.030 --> 00:25:45.240
question was is it possible to determine
which one of your friends already use

00:25:45.240 --> 00:25:45.250
which one of your friends already use
 

00:25:45.250 --> 00:25:50.880
which one of your friends already use
your app that is not yet available as an

00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:50.890
your app that is not yet available as an
 

00:25:50.890 --> 00:25:53.090
your app that is not yet available as an
API call you could do it on your side

00:25:53.090 --> 00:25:53.100
API call you could do it on your side
 

00:25:53.100 --> 00:25:55.440
API call you could do it on your side
that would definitely be in the category

00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:55.450
that would definitely be in the category
 

00:25:55.450 --> 00:25:57.750
that would definitely be in the category
of geez we should probably do that so

00:25:57.750 --> 00:25:57.760
of geez we should probably do that so
 

00:25:57.760 --> 00:26:01.710
of geez we should probably do that so
watch for it seems like a logical next

00:26:01.710 --> 00:26:01.720
watch for it seems like a logical next
 

00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:04.770
watch for it seems like a logical next
step yep so the question was I mentioned

00:26:04.770 --> 00:26:04.780
step yep so the question was I mentioned
 

00:26:04.780 --> 00:26:06.420
step yep so the question was I mentioned
that we have an affinity algorithm so we

00:26:06.420 --> 00:26:06.430
that we have an affinity algorithm so we
 

00:26:06.430 --> 00:26:08.010
that we have an affinity algorithm so we
can return a list of friends based on

00:26:08.010 --> 00:26:08.020
can return a list of friends based on
 

00:26:08.020 --> 00:26:09.110
can return a list of friends based on
affinity what does that look like

00:26:09.110 --> 00:26:09.120
affinity what does that look like
 

00:26:09.120 --> 00:26:11.160
affinity what does that look like
unfortunately we don't have a way to

00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:11.170
unfortunately we don't have a way to
 

00:26:11.170 --> 00:26:13.290
unfortunately we don't have a way to
rank it based on kind of affinity by

00:26:13.290 --> 00:26:13.300
rank it based on kind of affinity by
 

00:26:13.300 --> 00:26:15.570
rank it based on kind of affinity by
interest we only have overall affinity

00:26:15.570 --> 00:26:15.580
interest we only have overall affinity
 

00:26:15.580 --> 00:26:16.440
interest we only have overall affinity
which is basically

00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:16.450
which is basically
 

00:26:16.450 --> 00:26:17.780
which is basically

of the most interesting things that I
 

00:37:56.039 --> 00:37:58.220
of the most interesting things that I
found in all this so we launched the

00:37:58.220 --> 00:37:58.230
found in all this so we launched the
 

00:37:58.230 --> 00:38:00.980
found in all this so we launched the
Google+ sign-in notion about eight or

Google+ sign-in notion about eight or
 

00:38:00.990 --> 00:38:03.020
Google+ sign-in notion about eight or
nine months ago right so the meebo team

00:38:03.020 --> 00:38:03.030
nine months ago right so the meebo team
 

00:38:03.030 --> 00:38:04.370
nine months ago right so the meebo team
got here like I said it took us a few

00:38:04.370 --> 00:38:04.380
got here like I said it took us a few
 

00:38:04.380 --> 00:38:06.170
got here like I said it took us a few
months to get it out then we got it out

00:38:06.170 --> 00:38:06.180
months to get it out then we got it out
 

00:38:06.180 --> 00:38:07.910
months to get it out then we got it out
and I'll tell you a story about

00:38:07.910 --> 00:38:07.920
and I'll tell you a story about
 

00:38:07.920 --> 00:38:09.380
and I'll tell you a story about
something that I completely screwed up

00:38:09.380 --> 00:38:09.390
something that I completely screwed up
 

00:38:09.390 --> 00:38:13.660
something that I completely screwed up
so when we got here my theory was

00:38:13.660 --> 00:38:13.670
so when we got here my theory was
 

00:38:13.670 --> 00:38:16.460
so when we got here my theory was
sign-in by itself was completely

00:38:16.460 --> 00:38:16.470
sign-in by itself was completely
 

00:38:16.470 --> 00:38:18.410
sign-in by itself was completely
irrelevant and didn't matter right it

00:38:18.410 --> 00:38:18.420
irrelevant and didn't matter right it
 

00:38:18.420 --> 00:38:20.779
irrelevant and didn't matter right it
was like great we have a google sign an

00:38:20.779 --> 00:38:20.789
was like great we have a google sign an
 

00:38:20.789 --> 00:38:22.700
was like great we have a google sign an
option that doesn't matter what matters

00:38:22.700 --> 00:38:22.710
option that doesn't matter what matters
 

00:38:22.710 --> 00:38:24.559
option that doesn't matter what matters
are the features that we put behind it

00:38:24.559 --> 00:38:24.569
are the features that we put behind it
 

00:38:24.569 --> 00:38:27.410
are the features that we put behind it
like you know a user signs in and you

00:38:27.410 --> 00:38:27.420
like you know a user signs in and you
 

00:38:27.420 --> 00:38:28.970
like you know a user signs in and you
now have access to their calendar or a

00:38:28.970 --> 00:38:28.980
now have access to their calendar or a
 

00:38:28.980 --> 00:38:30.769
now have access to their calendar or a
user signs in and now we can help you

00:38:30.769 --> 00:38:30.779
user signs in and now we can help you
 

00:38:30.779 --> 00:38:32.870
