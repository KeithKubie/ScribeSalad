00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:07.350
[applause]

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.170
&gt;&gt;Gal Luft: Thank you folks, always good to
be back at Google.

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:18.510
And I think that the issue is very timely
always because, we'll always have problems

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:27.420
with energy. But before I talk about "Turning
Oil Into Salt", before I talk about salty

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.910
commodities, I wanna start on a sweet note
and talk to you about something I like much

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.250
more than oil and more than salt and that
is chocolate.

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:47.160
I'm sure you all like chocolate and you probably
all consume it on a daily basis, but I wanna

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:54.620
take you through an exercise. So indulge me
for a second. Let's assume that all of us

00:00:54.620 --> 00:01:01.890
are members of a certain village and we have
this genetic problem in our bodies that the

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.030
only thing we can eat is chocolate.

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.299
That's the only thing we can eat; breakfast,
lunch, and dinner chocolate.

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:15.000
So I think some of you like the idea, but
I tell you a week like this would be a very,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:23.320
very bad week for all of us. Why is it? Because
this week there've been some riots in Ivory

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:32.369
Coast. And Ivory Coast is a place that produces
35 percent of the world's cocoa beans. So

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:40.460
when there is trouble with cocoa beans, those
of us who can only eat chocolate, it's a source

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:41.460
of great anxiety.

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.979
[pause]

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:52.289
Well luckily none of us lose sleep over the
riots in Ivory Coast because we're not that

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:58.840
dependent on chocolate after all. We can eat
many other foods and we're just okay and if

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:04.740
something is wrong with chocolate then, alright
not a big deal.

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:12.600
And I think if you understand this, you understand
what it means, what the concept of turning

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:23.500
oil into salt means. It's about strategic
commodities. Our energy dependence, our oil

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:29.530
dependence problem, is not about the amount
of oil that we consume or the amount of oil

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:38.390
that we import. It is about the fact that
oil is the most strategic commodity in the

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:39.390
world.

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:45.890
Why it is strategic commodity, because our
cars, trucks, ships, and planes can run on

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:52.760
nothing but oil. Go to San Francisco or San
Jose Airport and you'll see all of the planes

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:57.640
have one thing in common: they can run on
nothing but oil.

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:03.310
When I tried to look into the issue of strategic
commodity throughout world history, there

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:09.340
were many commodities that at some point human
beings depended upon and really shaped the

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:16.030
geopolitics of the world in a very fundamental
way. And none of them really resonated with

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:27.890
me like the story of salt. Because salt, just
like oil today, has a monopoly over transportation.

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:31.590
Salt used to have a monopoly over food preservation.

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:37.520
If you lived in Russia and you wanted to eat
well in the middle of the winter you needed

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:42.550
to preserve a lot of food during the summer
by curing it with salt.

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:50.150
And if you read the world history for generations
and generations, it was all about who has

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:58.660
salt. Where is the salt? How can we build
colonies around the areas where salt happens

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:03.780
to be located? Countries used to go to war
over salt.

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:13.390
The word "salary" comes from the word "salt."
You heard the expression, "Salt of the earth."

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:26.770
Now if you look at those places that had salt
you see, and I could throw a bunch of names

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:36.000
I doubt that people heard about, places like
Boa Vista or Tortuga or Turk Island or Orissa.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.650
These were important places just like the
Saudi Arabia, the Dubai, and the Abu Dhabi's

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:42.760
of our own days.

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:51.380
Now what happened? Why is it that right now
we live in a world in which we consume more

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:57.740
salt than we ever did before, we import more
salt than we ever did before, but we don't

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:03.650
think, I don't think we'll ever go to war
over salt. I don't think that many of us know

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:10.470
who are the biggest world holders of salt,
and I don't think we really care.

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:11.470
What happened?

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:17.100
I'll tell you what happened. We broke the
salt monopoly. We broke the monopoly of salt

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:24.410
over food preservation. Actually not we, I
give the credit to Napoleon because in the

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:31.580
year 1800 Napoleon, who had really big ambitions
and wanted to take over the world and send

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:39.780
his military to Russia, he realized that salt
is his Achilles' heel. So he said, "We're

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:45.930
gonna introduce a prize, a cash prize." And
he declared a prize of 12,000 francs to the

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:53.910
person that will come up with a solution to
France's salt dependence.

00:05:53.910 --> 00:06:03.080
And a very short time after that a French
chef invented the first form of canning. And

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:14.760
later on came refrigeration and electricity,
and salt lost its strategic status forever.

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:22.060
This is what we need to do to oil. We need
to turn oil into salt. We need to strip oil

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:31.020
of its strategic status by introducing competition
to oil in the transportation sector; the very

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:33.770
same sector that happens to underlie the world
economy.

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:40.860
Remember, the countries that own oil, essentially
control the world economy because oil controls

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:45.990
transportation; transportation controls the
world economy.

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:53.060
So if you want to eat asparagus 365 days a
year, you need to move it around the globe.

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:58.820
And it moves around the globe onboard ships
and trucks and planes that run on oil. And

00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:02.550
that has to end.

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:10.100
Now the monopoly of oil in the transportation
sector is only half the problem.

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:15.820
The second half of the problem, which makes
it much worse, is the fact that most of the

00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:22.460
world oil is controlled by a cartel. And I
want to explain it to you a little bit about

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:27.750
this cartel because 78 percent of the world's
oil is in the hands of OPEC. There are 13

00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:34.669
governments, not the most democratic of governments
in the world, as you know, primarily run by

00:07:34.669 --> 00:07:45.960
Saudi Arabia, Iran, Nigeria, Venezuela, and
this cartel --

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:53.680
produces today less oil, less oil than they
did 40 years ago.

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:59.400
So the world economy doubled, we have China,
we have India, we have all of these growth

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:07.310
engines and we need so much more oil, but
OPEC today produces less oil than they did

00:08:07.310 --> 00:08:18.389
40 years ago. And it's a deliberate policy
to constrain the supply of oil, to drill far

00:08:18.389 --> 00:08:21.960
less than their ability, the geological ability.

00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:30.320
So you have a situation today that the folks
who control 78 percent of the reserves, only

00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:38.399
produce a third of the supply, and the rest
of the two-thirds of the supply are produced

00:08:38.399 --> 00:08:48.569
by the folks who have less than 20 percent.
It doesn't make sense.

00:08:48.569 --> 00:08:54.470
And that's why we have to break the oil cartel.
But we cannot break the oil cartel. What are

00:08:54.470 --> 00:09:00.040
we gonna do bomb them? No we can't go in and
throw a bomb in Vienna and destroy the headquarters

00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:01.040
of OPEC.

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:06.660
But what we can do is break the monopoly of
oil over transportation by introducing something

00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:16.999
that OPEC is extremely afraid of and that
is Adam Smith; competition. Alright?

00:09:16.999 --> 00:09:21.119
And I wanna talk to you how we can do it,
and I believe we can do it, and I believe

00:09:21.119 --> 00:09:26.011
it is absolutely essential that we do it,
not because, only because of national security

00:09:26.011 --> 00:09:33.129
reasons that you all understand, but because
it is a precondition for us to retain and

00:09:33.129 --> 00:09:36.680
maintain our prosperity.

00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:46.089
Our oil demand imposes a huge levy on our
economy; huge. People are unaware of how heavy

00:09:46.089 --> 00:09:49.420
this burden is on our economy.

00:09:49.420 --> 00:09:55.600
Just to give you a sense, we today we are
in a recession now and oil is $90 a barrel.

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:59.730
I mean in the middle of a recession and it's
still $90 a barrel. Imagine to yourself what

00:09:59.730 --> 00:10:06.180
will be the price of oil when we resume growth.
Imagine to yourself what happens to oil prices

00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:10.620
if the dollar collapses and there is a run
on commodities. Or what happens if there is

00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:14.050
inflation and there is a run on commodities.

00:10:14.050 --> 00:10:24.079
So if oil is $90 in the middle of the recession,
it is almost a given that the price will go

00:10:24.079 --> 00:10:27.100
up as we resume growth.

00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:33.029
But even today at $90 a barrel we pay for
oil as a nation more money than we give the

00:10:33.029 --> 00:10:41.170
Department of Defense to defend us from our
enemies. We're talking about $700 billion

00:10:41.170 --> 00:10:47.910
that we pay as a country for oil. This is,
by the way, almost 10 times more than we paid

00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:52.430
10 years ago. So in about 10 years the amount
of money that we have to pay as a nation for

00:10:52.430 --> 00:10:54.080
oil grew ten-fold.

00:10:54.080 --> 00:11:00.970
Now this is money that instead of staying
here, instead of creating jobs and investment

00:11:00.970 --> 00:11:06.629
opportunities here in the United States, is
moving abroad to do nation building. To do

00:11:06.629 --> 00:11:12.029
nation building in Saudi Arabia, to do nation
building in Iran, to do nation building in

00:11:12.029 --> 00:11:17.930
Venezuela, but it doesn't do nation building
here in the United States where we need the

00:11:17.930 --> 00:11:24.429
money to build our crumbling economy.

00:11:24.429 --> 00:11:31.139
And I wanna also touch a few points that are
related to some of the interest of Google

00:11:31.139 --> 00:11:34.249
that have to do with the price of oil.

00:11:34.249 --> 00:11:41.959
Google is very interested, for example, in
renewable energy. What happens to investment

00:11:41.959 --> 00:11:49.600
in renewable energy when oil prices go back
to $150 a barrel and there is another recession?

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:54.490
We cannot afford to have another recession.
You know another recession is like your second

00:11:54.490 --> 00:11:59.690
heart attack. You can maybe withstand the
first one, but if you're too weak and then

00:11:59.690 --> 00:12:05.819
you get a second one, that's not good. That
could be fatal.

00:12:05.819 --> 00:12:09.899
But what happens to investment in alternative
energy and renewable energy when there is

00:12:09.899 --> 00:12:14.399
a recession, of course, the funding dries
up; investment houses don't have money to

00:12:14.399 --> 00:12:16.429
invest; everything stops.

00:12:16.429 --> 00:12:21.600
We see what happens now in Cancun. We see
that everything that has to do with trying

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:29.209
to advance policies to fix the environment,
people are not interested. People are moving

00:12:29.209 --> 00:12:32.420
away from this issue because there are other
priorities. They need to take care of their

00:12:32.420 --> 00:12:34.439
jobs and mortgages.

00:12:34.439 --> 00:12:43.759
The other thing that happens when oil prices
go up is starvation and devastation in the

00:12:43.759 --> 00:12:49.360
poor countries of the world. Because those
poor countries of the world in Africa and

00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:55.490
Latin America in Asia they don't get a discount
for being poor, they still have to buy oil

00:12:55.490 --> 00:13:01.329
for $150-$200 a barrel just like everybody
else. So they don't get preferential treatment

00:13:01.329 --> 00:13:06.309
for being poor. And that kills them; that
destroys them.

00:13:06.309 --> 00:13:12.879
In some places in Africa when oil prices go
up you cannot distribute food and people literally

00:13:12.879 --> 00:13:15.279
starve.

00:13:15.279 --> 00:13:21.999
So it is our responsibility to make sure that
we do not allow oil prices to go to the level

00:13:21.999 --> 00:13:28.319
that we saw in 2008 and beyond. And just this
week the Iranian government, that happens

00:13:28.319 --> 00:13:32.360
to be the President of OPEC at the moment,
said that they're very comfortable with $100

00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:38.399
oil. They said, "That is a fair price."

00:13:38.399 --> 00:13:45.929
We cannot afford to pay $150 per barrel, and
we need to build mechanisms that will prevent

00:13:45.929 --> 00:13:50.899
oil prices to go to these kind of levels and
devastate our economy and other economies

00:13:50.899 --> 00:13:53.439
as well.

00:13:53.439 --> 00:14:00.070
What I'm suggesting here that the most important
thing to do in order to break the oil monopoly

00:14:00.070 --> 00:14:05.540
in transportation, is to stop doing the silly
things that we are doing today which is to

00:14:05.540 --> 00:14:09.339
put cars on the road that can run only on
petroleum.

00:14:09.339 --> 00:14:17.230
Remember we talked about the chocolate before?
We continue to produce kids that can only

00:14:17.230 --> 00:14:25.209
eat chocolate, if you want. We continue to
produce cars that can only run on oil. And

00:14:25.209 --> 00:14:31.220
we do it at a rate of about 10 to 15 million
a year; only in the United States.

00:14:31.220 --> 00:14:35.910
So while we are concerned about the future
of oil, while we are talking about depletion

00:14:35.910 --> 00:14:41.009
of oil, while we are talking about oil geopolitical
and geoeconomic issues associated with oil

00:14:41.009 --> 00:14:48.079
at the same time we continue to put every
year between 10 and 15 million new cars on

00:14:48.079 --> 00:14:53.899
the road that can run on nothing but oil.
How's that for smart policy?

00:14:53.899 --> 00:15:00.540
You know they say, "If you're in a hole, the
first thing you do is stop digging." Right?

00:15:00.540 --> 00:15:06.910
Well we're digging, we're digging fast. And
that has to stop.

00:15:06.910 --> 00:15:13.029
So luckily we have technologies and we have
the ability to do it and to do it pretty quickly.

00:15:13.029 --> 00:15:19.170
Google has been very active on the electrification
of transportation and I think it's a very

00:15:19.170 --> 00:15:26.249
good idea, because if people drive cars on
electricity, on batteries instead of oil,

00:15:26.249 --> 00:15:27.309
then few things happen.

00:15:27.309 --> 00:15:33.040
First of all, you drive your car on something
that is cleaner, is more efficient, it's quiet,

00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:39.299
it's cheaper, it's more environmentally friendly,
even if the electricity is made from coal

00:15:39.299 --> 00:15:42.449
it's still better than running your car on
gasoline.

00:15:42.449 --> 00:15:48.350
So there are many, many reasons why we need
to electrify our transportation system; why

00:15:48.350 --> 00:15:51.829
we need to move to electric vehicles.

00:15:51.829 --> 00:15:57.180
But let us be frank and let us understand
that this is not a quick fix. This is not

00:15:57.180 --> 00:16:00.819
something that can happen overnight.

00:16:00.819 --> 00:16:07.999
In our book, "Turning Oil Into Salt, we looked
into what did it take to get those batteries

00:16:07.999 --> 00:16:13.879
quickly into the market. In the end it's a
matter of cost. If you're battery costs more

00:16:13.879 --> 00:16:23.029
than the car then there is a problem. So what
do we need to do to bring the cost down?"

00:16:23.029 --> 00:16:30.089
The first thing I want you to understand about
batteries is first is that the battery is

00:16:30.089 --> 00:16:38.550
a box full of commodities; it's a smart box.
It has a brain, but in the end it is a big

00:16:38.550 --> 00:16:48.220
box and it has commodities; a lot of them.
About anywhere between 20 and 30 different

00:16:48.220 --> 00:16:55.399
types of commodities, various metals and minerals
that go into the battery. If we are to build

00:16:55.399 --> 00:17:01.189
a huge fleet of electric vehicles we need
to make sure that we have those commodities.

00:17:01.189 --> 00:17:06.439
Let me throw a few examples here just to demonstrate
the magnitude of the challenge that we are

00:17:06.439 --> 00:17:13.309
facing. This Blackberry that I have here has
a small battery that takes about three grams

00:17:13.309 --> 00:17:22.269
of something called lithium carbonate which
is an essential component in the lithium-ion

00:17:22.269 --> 00:17:25.769
battery.

00:17:25.769 --> 00:17:37.039
The Volt that GM is putting on the road right
now has a battery that takes 24 kilos of lithium

00:17:37.039 --> 00:17:43.320
carbonate. So when you move from something
that takes three grams to something that takes

00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:48.240
20 kilos and up, and I'm not even talking
about the Tesla's of the world that take much

00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:55.679
more; think about what kind of ramp up you
need to supply the needs of the world. And

00:17:55.679 --> 00:17:58.559
we're talking millions of new batteries like
this.

00:17:58.559 --> 00:18:04.880
And we also talk about utility companies that
want to build big batteries to store electricity.

00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:09.440
Because one of our problems today with electricity
is that we cannot store it; we don't have

00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:18.429
storage capacity. But all of these storage
batteries will need a lot of materials. And

00:18:18.429 --> 00:18:24.519
that is true for lithium, that is true for
cobalt, that is true for rare earth elements,

00:18:24.519 --> 00:18:31.559
a family of metals of 17 metals that happen
to be mined today almost entirely in China.

00:18:31.559 --> 00:18:36.880
And when you look at those minerals you see
that every single one of them tells a story,

00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:40.970
and sometimes not a very happy story.

00:18:40.970 --> 00:18:49.250
Cobalt, for example: fifty percent of the
world's cobalt is concentrated in the so-called

00:18:49.250 --> 00:18:52.940
Democratic Republic of Congo.

00:18:52.940 --> 00:18:58.500
Now let me tell you what's happening in the
Democratic Republic of Congo. In the past

00:18:58.500 --> 00:19:07.860
decade there has been a genocide that is even
worse than the Holocaust; more than six million

00:19:07.860 --> 00:19:16.220
people were killed there in civil war. We're
talking about 40 percent of the women in Congo

00:19:16.220 --> 00:19:21.230
were raped at one point or another.

00:19:21.230 --> 00:19:27.951
This is a total hell and this is where our
cobalt is coming from. And this civil war

00:19:27.951 --> 00:19:34.070
can resume any day because the tensions are
still there and nothing has been resolved

00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:38.730
over the years and this is a very, very unstable
place.

00:19:38.730 --> 00:19:46.010
Rare earth elements were in the news recently
when China imposed a minor embargo in rare

00:19:46.010 --> 00:19:51.120
earth supply to Japan and to the United States,
because they were unhappy about some of the

00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:58.970
policies. And because one Japanese fishing
ship collided into another Chinese ship and

00:19:58.970 --> 00:20:04.610
they were up in arms and they decided to punish
the Japanese by not sending them rare earth

00:20:04.610 --> 00:20:07.510
for their battery industry.

00:20:07.510 --> 00:20:14.450
So what we have to realize is that while we
want the solar panels, the wind turbines,

00:20:14.450 --> 00:20:19.000
the electric vehicles, electric motors, we're
gonna have to make sure that we have all of

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:24.940
these materials to supply our needs for the
21st century. It's not gonna happen just because

00:20:24.940 --> 00:20:30.380
we want it to happen; it will happen if we
take the necessary steps to ensure that we

00:20:30.380 --> 00:20:38.240
have the entire supply chain of those next
generation energy devices.

00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:43.820
And we have to invest in it; we have to invest
in developing a domestic supply chain. We

00:20:43.820 --> 00:20:49.230
need to invest in mining because as much as
you like renewable energy, as much as you

00:20:49.230 --> 00:20:54.370
like the solars and the wind and the electric
vehicles, you have to realize that renewable

00:20:54.370 --> 00:21:00.690
energy, like it or not, begins at the mine.

00:21:00.690 --> 00:21:07.870
If you want to build those big four megawatt
offshore wind turbines you need huge magnets,

00:21:07.870 --> 00:21:16.500
huge; hundreds of kilos of neodymium, which
is one of the rare earth metals that I talked

00:21:16.500 --> 00:21:18.870
about.

00:21:18.870 --> 00:21:25.880
So that's one thing to remember about the
electrification of transportation. We have

00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:34.580
to reduce the cost of some of the components
in the battery supply chain.

00:21:34.580 --> 00:21:40.179
One of the things that we revealed in the
book is that the most expensive component

00:21:40.179 --> 00:21:49.690
of an auto battery today is something called
a separator. It's a thin sheet of plastic,

00:21:49.690 --> 00:21:56.190
very smart plastic, but something that looks
like thin sheet of plastic that separates

00:21:56.190 --> 00:22:06.510
between the anode and the cathode. This intellectual
property makes up about 10 to 12 percent of

00:22:06.510 --> 00:22:14.399
the cost of the battery. The IP actually belongs
to Exxon Chemicals.

00:22:14.399 --> 00:22:19.200
So that's the kind of things we need to pay
attention to. How can we bring down the cost

00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:25.130
of batteries? How can we identify those components
in the battery that can really bring the cost

00:22:25.130 --> 00:22:29.610
down to allow the expedited commercialization?

00:22:29.610 --> 00:22:36.110
If you looked at batteries today in China
you see something very interesting; they're

00:22:36.110 --> 00:22:41.520
very cheap; much cheaper than the batteries
that we put in the cars in the United States.

00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:42.520
Now why?

00:22:42.520 --> 00:22:48.110
Because the demands from the battery in China
are much less stringent than they are in the

00:22:48.110 --> 00:22:54.770
United States. We want here a battery that
will run for 10 years or 100,000 miles. And

00:22:54.770 --> 00:22:59.690
the Chinese say, "Well you know maybe instead
of 10 years we'll do 7 years. That's good

00:22:59.690 --> 00:23:09.240
enough." And because the demands are less
stringent, they can get lower cost.

00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:15.540
And I think the key is to really begin to
put cars on the road and to start with a good

00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:22.900
enough and to improve it later on. We did
not wait for the Intel Centrino to put the

00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:32.710
Commodore 64 in the marketplace. We started
with something that today looks really silly

00:23:32.710 --> 00:23:38.980
and not a great computer, but at the time
it was good enough. And I think we should

00:23:38.980 --> 00:23:46.320
adopt this mindset of starting with a good
enough, improving it as the years go by.

00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:53.929
And I believe that we will see electrification,
but the question is: what's gonna happen in

00:23:53.929 --> 00:24:01.429
the next 20 years before we see electric vehicles
in very large numbers? Will we be able to

00:24:01.429 --> 00:24:09.769
survive the oil spikes that will come, no
doubt, and could drive our economy into chaos

00:24:09.769 --> 00:24:17.180
in the next 20 years? Can we afford to bet
the farm only on one solution, that electric

00:24:17.180 --> 00:24:22.970
car, and neglect the intermediate and near
term solutions? I believe that we cannot have

00:24:22.970 --> 00:24:26.169
this luxury. I think it would be a huge mistake.

00:24:26.169 --> 00:24:33.230
A few years ago we had a President who said,
"A kid born today his first car will be a

00:24:33.230 --> 00:24:39.080
hydrogen fuel cell car." Well this kid is
almost 10 years old now and I don't think

00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:43.610
that the first car that he or she will drive
will be a hydrogen fuel cell car.

00:24:43.610 --> 00:24:49.250
So even though we think that sometimes we
know what the future will look like, sometimes

00:24:49.250 --> 00:24:55.480
that's not the case, and we need to have stop
gap solutions. And I think that the most important

00:24:55.480 --> 00:25:03.029
stop gap solution is to have liquid fuel choice.
We need to have liquids that can coexist with

00:25:03.029 --> 00:25:09.740
our gasoline system on board the pretty much
the same internal combustion engines, and

00:25:09.740 --> 00:25:15.309
to make sure that we have a healthy competition
in the transportation fuel market among a

00:25:15.309 --> 00:25:18.289
number of fuels.

00:25:18.289 --> 00:25:23.509
Now let's talk a little bit about the liquids,
because I believe that if there is something

00:25:23.509 --> 00:25:31.090
that is missing in our energy picture is this
liquid fuel competition.

00:25:31.090 --> 00:25:35.450
First of all how do we enable liquid fuel
competition? The first thing that will need

00:25:35.450 --> 00:25:43.059
to happen is that cars that we invent, that
we put on the road, are flex fuel vehicles.

00:25:43.059 --> 00:25:48.120
Flex fuel vehicles are cars that look and
behave like the cars that you drive today

00:25:48.120 --> 00:25:53.630
with one difference: there is a chip and there
is a more robust fuel line; the plastics and

00:25:53.630 --> 00:25:58.350
the rubbers are made from materials that are
more resistant to corrosion.

00:25:58.350 --> 00:26:06.190
And that enables a whole family of alcohols
and ethers and commodity chemicals to be blended

00:26:06.190 --> 00:26:12.799
into our gasoline at any ratio at any combination
that you want and reduce the amount of oil

00:26:12.799 --> 00:26:17.769
that we need to move us from one place to
another.

00:26:17.769 --> 00:26:24.120
Most of you are familiar with ethanol; this
is only one of those alcohols. Everybody has

00:26:24.120 --> 00:26:29.950
an opinion about ethanol. Some people like
ethanol; some people hate ethanol; both have

00:26:29.950 --> 00:26:35.889
good arguments. I'm not here to rebut any
of this.

00:26:35.889 --> 00:26:41.191
Ethanol has good attributes, it has bad attributes,
but what I want to make sure is that you all

00:26:41.191 --> 00:26:48.750
understand that ethanol is only one of many
liquids that currently can play a role in

00:26:48.750 --> 00:26:53.769
the transportation fuel market, but they are
not allowed to do it because the cars are

00:26:53.769 --> 00:26:57.280
not warranted to run on them.

00:26:57.280 --> 00:27:04.620
Sort of like you go to a bar and all you can
order is vodka. But you like gin or rum or

00:27:04.620 --> 00:27:13.629
whiskey and you should be able to buy any
form of alcohol that you want in this bar.

00:27:13.629 --> 00:27:21.259
But if the barman says, "Sorry, only vodka
is allowed," what can you do?

00:27:21.259 --> 00:27:27.230
Let me talk a little bit about an alcohol
that I think presents a very, very promising

00:27:27.230 --> 00:27:32.970
potential for a variety of reasons, and it's
called methanol.

00:27:32.970 --> 00:27:39.499
Methanol is essentially wood alcohol, it's
a very simple alcohol, it can be made from

00:27:39.499 --> 00:27:43.929
anything that contains carbon. It can be made
from natural gas, it can be made from coal,

00:27:43.929 --> 00:27:46.940
it can be made from biomass material.

00:27:46.940 --> 00:27:54.769
And guess what? We describe it in Chapter
6 of the book, it can also be made from CO2.

00:27:54.769 --> 00:28:00.890
Wouldn't that be nice if we could take CO2
and convert it into fuel? Instead of finding

00:28:00.890 --> 00:28:06.210
all kind of innovative ways, expensive ways
to take the CO2 to ship it all over the place,

00:28:06.210 --> 00:28:11.950
to bury it somewhere in the ground and hope
that it stays there forever; we can take the

00:28:11.950 --> 00:28:20.539
same CO2 and recycle it by using it as a building
block for liquid fuel that can run in the

00:28:20.539 --> 00:28:25.909
very same cars that we have today.

00:28:25.909 --> 00:28:30.139
That's the kind of thing I would like to see
us doing with CO2. This is the kind of thing

00:28:30.139 --> 00:28:33.919
that methanol can allow us to do.

00:28:33.919 --> 00:28:40.039
Methanol, we just found a lot of natural gas
in this country; natural gas prices are very

00:28:40.039 --> 00:28:48.779
low; natural gas burns cleaner than oil. Why
not make methanol from natural gas?

00:28:48.779 --> 00:28:56.460
Methanol from natural gas sells today for
about one dollar a gallon; clearly very competitive

00:28:56.460 --> 00:28:59.179
with oil.

00:28:59.179 --> 00:29:06.279
Methanol from biomass is easier and cheaper
to do than ethanol from biomass because we

00:29:06.279 --> 00:29:10.929
don't need to invent all kind of bugs and
enzymes and all kind of funny creatures that

00:29:10.929 --> 00:29:18.450
will digest the biomass, we can simply gasify
the biomass and turn it into wood alcohol,

00:29:18.450 --> 00:29:21.269
methanol.

00:29:21.269 --> 00:29:30.059
Methanol offers us all kind of opportunities
overseas. I just heard a few days ago that

00:29:30.059 --> 00:29:40.159
the Iraqi, in Iraq 50 percent of Iraq's natural
gas is being flared; flared! Can you imagine?

00:29:40.159 --> 00:29:45.720
And this is methane, this is not CO2. So you
take one of the most potent greenhouse gases

00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:49.759
and you flare it.

00:29:49.759 --> 00:29:54.720
And that happens in Africa; that happens all
over the world. We take something that is

00:29:54.720 --> 00:30:01.499
a very useful source of energy and we burn
it. What a waste.

00:30:01.499 --> 00:30:09.529
But if you could capture this gas and monetize
it by commoditizing it, by turning it into

00:30:09.529 --> 00:30:15.000
methanol which is a very easy conversion,
then all of a sudden you can sell it and you

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:17.950
don't have to flare it. And those poor countries
can make some money.

00:30:17.950 --> 00:30:29.960
And help out poor countries. What do poor
countries do? What are they good at? Agriculture;

00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:35.580
most poor people in the world work in agriculture.
Most poor people in the world grow plants.

00:30:35.580 --> 00:30:44.019
That's what they do. They don't work at Google;
they grow plants.

00:30:44.019 --> 00:30:50.139
And if we have an alcohol economy, if we have
cars that can run on alcohol in addition to

00:30:50.139 --> 00:30:56.450
gasoline, those countries will be able to
produce their own fuels. They then will be

00:30:56.450 --> 00:31:06.650
able to grow more and more of their fuels
instead of buying oil for $150 or $200 or

00:31:06.650 --> 00:31:13.279
$300 a barrel of oil.
So if we go again and face one of those spikes

00:31:13.279 --> 00:31:21.149
in price at least there'll be something that
they can do to alleviate this economic pain.

00:31:21.149 --> 00:31:28.190
And I want to explain to you, to give you
a demonstration. What happens to an economy

00:31:28.190 --> 00:31:33.639
that has fuel flexibility, that has those
flex fuel cars, which by the way, cost only

00:31:33.639 --> 00:31:40.840
$100 extra for auto manufacturers to make?
So if you're a GM or Ford or Chrysler if you

00:31:40.840 --> 00:31:48.019
want to make all of your cars flex fuel, it's
roughly 100 bucks per car; GM claims $70.

00:31:48.019 --> 00:31:57.200
So let's take a country that actually did
that; it's called Brazil. And let's look what

00:31:57.200 --> 00:32:02.289
happened to Brazil when 90 percent of cars
sold in Brazil are flex fuel vehicles. Let's

00:32:02.289 --> 00:32:10.360
see what happened to Brazil in 2008 when all
of us suffered under this terrible $150 oil

00:32:10.360 --> 00:32:11.360
situation.

00:32:11.360 --> 00:32:20.360
In Brazil it was barely felt. Why? Because
Brazilians had fuel choice at the pump; when

00:32:20.360 --> 00:32:27.379
oil prices became too high, they had cars
that were able to absorb alternatives and

00:32:27.379 --> 00:32:33.909
they opted for the lowest cost fuel, just
like anybody would do.

00:32:33.909 --> 00:32:39.789
I mean people are economic creatures, after
all. And you know what happened in Brazil

00:32:39.789 --> 00:32:50.600
in 2008? Something really remarkable: gasoline
in Brazil in 2008 became an alternative fuel.

00:32:50.600 --> 00:33:00.809
Less gasoline was sold in Brazil than ethanol,
which they happen to make from sugar cane.

00:33:00.809 --> 00:33:10.490
So you see that when you look at it from the
standpoint of strategic commodities we have

00:33:10.490 --> 00:33:18.080
alternatives to oil. But we need to put them
to work. We need to be able to allow those

00:33:18.080 --> 00:33:25.289
alternatives to play in a free market environment.

00:33:25.289 --> 00:33:36.090
Today we have a mandate that says that we
can only use gasoline in our cars. We have

00:33:36.090 --> 00:33:42.040
to have a different mandate. We have to have
a mandate that says that you cannot sell a

00:33:42.040 --> 00:33:49.860
car in the United States unless it offers
you fuel choice. That is the mandate that

00:33:49.860 --> 00:33:53.779
I would like to see happening in this country.

00:33:53.779 --> 00:34:00.179
We should have an open fuel standard that
requires that every car sold in America, if

00:34:00.179 --> 00:34:04.179
you are Ford or Toyota and you want to sell
cars in the United States, they have to offer

00:34:04.179 --> 00:34:10.639
fuel choice. And yes you'll have to invest
the extra $100 in making the car just like

00:34:10.639 --> 00:34:16.200
you invested a few dollars in putting a seat
belt or an airbag or a rearview mirror or

00:34:16.200 --> 00:34:24.840
FM radio. Or just recently I heard camera
that sort of watches how you drive in reverse

00:34:24.840 --> 00:34:25.860
to prevent accidents.

00:34:25.860 --> 00:34:38.200
The economic benefit is clear. It is a way
for us to cut our oil expenditure significantly.

00:34:38.200 --> 00:34:46.010
It is a way for us to protect ourselves against
oil spikes that can drive us into our second

00:34:46.010 --> 00:34:53.270
and potentially fatal heart attack. It is
a way for us to protect our national interests

00:34:53.270 --> 00:34:55.840
and our national security.

00:34:55.840 --> 00:35:02.360
All of those alternatives are more environmentally
friendly than gasoline. So there's clear environmental

00:35:02.360 --> 00:35:12.550
benefit by using all of the above whether
it is electricity, alcohols, you name it.

00:35:12.550 --> 00:35:21.010
So this is really something that we could
do without putting an onerous burden on our

00:35:21.010 --> 00:35:26.391
deficit, without Congress paying many, many
billions of dollars to implement all kind

00:35:26.391 --> 00:35:27.391
of policies.

00:35:27.391 --> 00:35:31.540
You all know what kind of Congress we have
today in Washington; this is a Congress that

00:35:31.540 --> 00:35:36.960
was elected on the platform of fiscal conservatism.
So there's not going to be a lot of money

00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:45.850
to go around to distribute to all kind of
great project that maybe some of you would

00:35:45.850 --> 00:35:49.480
like to see. So we have to be realistic.

00:35:49.480 --> 00:35:55.480
And if I started talking about politics maybe
I will throw in one or two thoughts here about

00:35:55.480 --> 00:35:57.200
the new Congress.

00:35:57.200 --> 00:36:05.280
We have a Republican control over the House
and very likely in two years from now there'll

00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:12.710
be Republic control over the Senate. So any
way you look at it when you have 23 Democrats

00:36:12.710 --> 00:36:18.800
running for re-election in the Senate and
only 10 Democrats, the likelihood is that

00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:24.620
in 2012 Republicans will take over the Senate
as well, if not the White House too.

00:36:24.620 --> 00:36:34.910
So we have to think about solutions that can
be accepted by Republicans and Democrats alike.

00:36:34.910 --> 00:36:42.290
This is the reality that we live in and we
cannot afford to spend the next four, five,

00:36:42.290 --> 00:36:48.940
six, I don't know how many years, but at least
four, on policies that have zero chance of

00:36:48.940 --> 00:36:51.510
success.

00:36:51.510 --> 00:36:57.260
And I think that there is one policy that
can really capture the interest of both Republicans

00:36:57.260 --> 00:37:04.770
and Democrats is the open fuel standard. Because
Republicans as well as Democrats don't like

00:37:04.770 --> 00:37:10.750
our oil dependence, they don't like the fact
that we export hundreds of billions of dollars

00:37:10.750 --> 00:37:18.040
every year to our enemies, they don't like
the fact that we are beholden to those governments,

00:37:18.040 --> 00:37:20.630
and they don't like monopolies and cartels.

00:37:20.630 --> 00:37:26.590
So I think that in this respect we have a
winning combination that if we just get some

00:37:26.590 --> 00:37:36.410
focus we can get this done in this coming
year. And if we do that, we break the oil

00:37:36.410 --> 00:37:42.860
cartel, we break the monopoly of oil, we turn
oil into salt. This is how you become energy

00:37:42.860 --> 00:37:49.990
independent. This is how you strip oil of
its strategic status. No longer chocolate

00:37:49.990 --> 00:37:51.510
only society.

00:37:51.510 --> 00:37:52.510
Thank you.

00:37:52.510 --> 00:37:55.880
[applause]

00:37:55.880 --> 00:38:12.150
&gt;&gt;commentator: Thank you Gal.

00:38:12.150 --> 00:38:13.790
Hello, ah there we go.

00:38:13.790 --> 00:38:18.660
Okay, thank you for that stimulating talk.
I'm gonna lead off with a few questions just

00:38:18.660 --> 00:38:22.580
to get the ball rolling and then I'll turn
things over to the audience.

00:38:22.580 --> 00:38:27.620
And I guess we don't have mics for the audience,
right? So you'll have to repeat the question.

00:38:27.620 --> 00:38:35.840
So first question is on this flex fuel initiative
which is very attractive; I'd buy the $100

00:38:35.840 --> 00:38:39.560
per car argument, but the other side is the
distribution network.

00:38:39.560 --> 00:38:45.670
So think back in the '70s there were a lot
of oil burning heat, the price of oil goes

00:38:45.670 --> 00:38:51.910
up, basically everybody switched to gas because
it was relatively cheap to do the switch as

00:38:51.910 --> 00:38:58.700
long as you had natural gas distribution to
your point of fuel usage.

00:38:58.700 --> 00:39:03.040
So what are the estimates of the cost for
providing the distribution system for flex

00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:04.040
fuels?

00:39:04.040 --> 00:39:09.440
&gt;&gt;Gal Luft: Yes, the distribution will happen
only when there are cars. No gas station owner

00:39:09.440 --> 00:39:15.580
will go into the hassle of retrofitting their
pumps and storage tanks unless they see that

00:39:15.580 --> 00:39:20.660
there are 20, 25 percent of the cars on the
road can actually run on the fuel. So we gotta

00:39:20.660 --> 00:39:22.430
start with the cars here.

00:39:22.430 --> 00:39:26.560
And that's why it's important that we have
an open fuel standard, because three years

00:39:26.560 --> 00:39:31.890
after you introduce an open fuel standard
you have enough cars on the road to reach

00:39:31.890 --> 00:39:38.130
this sweet spot in which gas station owner
says, "Now it makes sense for me to collect

00:39:38.130 --> 00:39:42.900
this tax credit and go through the hassle
of retrofitting a pump or two and maybe next

00:39:42.900 --> 00:39:48.451
year a third one and gradually to turn all
the pumps into alcohol pumps."

00:39:48.451 --> 00:39:55.130
Now the important thing to remember about
flex fuel is, a flex fuel car is like your

00:39:55.130 --> 00:40:02.560
cup of coffee. You can mix any amount of coffee
and milk that you want. You can drink your

00:40:02.560 --> 00:40:09.250
coffee black like I do; you can have a little
bit of milk; you can have a lot of milk. But

00:40:09.250 --> 00:40:18.140
if you're allergic to milk, you can drink
soy milk or coconut milk or rice milk. The

00:40:18.140 --> 00:40:24.940
car doesn't care. You can mix any combination
of gasoline, ethanol, and methanol at any

00:40:24.940 --> 00:40:28.820
blend you want and the car could not care.

00:40:28.820 --> 00:40:36.700
So it's not that you move from one liquid
to another; you can mix them and blend them

00:40:36.700 --> 00:40:41.340
as you wish. Having fuel choice, by the way,
does not mean that you need to exercise a

00:40:41.340 --> 00:40:45.740
choice. If you have fuel choice and you still
want to run your car on gasoline, fine do

00:40:45.740 --> 00:40:50.280
it; nobody's forcing you to do it. Just like
nobody's forcing you if you have plug in hybrid

00:40:50.280 --> 00:40:55.060
car that can run on electricity and liquid
fuel, nobody's forcing you to plug it in.

00:40:55.060 --> 00:40:59.370
If you don't feel like plug it in, fine, drive
your car on liquids.

00:40:59.370 --> 00:41:04.740
So I think that what it gives you is the flexibility
and I believe that supply chain and distribution

00:41:04.740 --> 00:41:11.250
chain will follow once there is incentive,
once there are cars, and once, of course,

00:41:11.250 --> 00:41:16.640
the oil prices are going to the place where
I think that they are going, which is North.

00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:24.330
&gt;&gt;commentator: One fuel that you didn't mention
that would work quite easily for vehicles

00:41:24.330 --> 00:41:30.280
is propane. I mean there are 13 million propane-powered
vehicles in the U.S. according to, in the

00:41:30.280 --> 00:41:35.190
world, according to the Wikipedia. And here
in the Bay Area we see lots of signs saying,

00:41:35.190 --> 00:41:36.720
"This bus is driven by propane."

00:41:36.720 --> 00:41:42.050
We already have a distribution mechanism for
that; there are a lot of public vehicles that

00:41:42.050 --> 00:41:45.810
are running on propane. How come that isn't
part of the solution here?

00:41:45.810 --> 00:41:50.730
&gt;&gt;Gal Luft: Well yeah, I mean it's called
CNG, compressed natural gas.

00:41:50.730 --> 00:41:52.410
&gt;&gt;commentator: Yeah, LNG, maybe, or --

00:41:52.410 --> 00:41:57.400
&gt;&gt;Gal Luft: It's not LNG, its compressed natural
gas; its gas that you basically compress it

00:41:57.400 --> 00:42:03.000
and put in a canister; it takes half of you
trunk and then you can drive your car and

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:10.410
it's a very elegant solution for fleets. That's
why you see busses and some taxis and garbage

00:42:10.410 --> 00:42:11.410
trucks and so forth.

00:42:11.410 --> 00:42:18.950
However, we looked at our institute at various
ways to utilize natural gas in transportation,

00:42:18.950 --> 00:42:25.820
and realized that the best way to use natural
gas in transportation, other than making electricity

00:42:25.820 --> 00:42:32.170
from it and then run it in electric vehicles,
is to turn the natural gas into methanol.

00:42:32.170 --> 00:42:34.070
And I want to explain why.

00:42:34.070 --> 00:42:42.770
The cost of a platform to run on CNG is in
the thousands extra. In other words, today

00:42:42.770 --> 00:42:51.830
to convert your car to run on CNG you're talking
at least $10,000 conversion, at least; whereas

00:42:51.830 --> 00:43:00.310
to make your car flex fuel 100 bucks. So it's
much easier in terms of cost to go to the

00:43:00.310 --> 00:43:04.540
methanol flex fuel route than CNG.

00:43:04.540 --> 00:43:11.130
However, I'm not opposed to it. I think that
there is a role for it in the overall mixture.

00:43:11.130 --> 00:43:19.270
Around the world, as you mentioned, there
are well over 10 million vehicles that can

00:43:19.270 --> 00:43:24.770
do it and already do it. But if you look carefully
into those numbers you see that most of those

00:43:24.770 --> 00:43:33.240
vehicles are in places like Iran, Pakistan,
Bangladesh.

00:43:33.240 --> 00:43:40.350
And the reason that you see it there and less
so in the developed world is because the equipment

00:43:40.350 --> 00:43:47.860
that they use, the tanks that they use, are
made from low grade materials. And that imposes

00:43:47.860 --> 00:43:50.420
all kind of safety concerns.

00:43:50.420 --> 00:43:54.280
You really if you wanna put your family in
a car like this you really wanna make sure

00:43:54.280 --> 00:44:04.470
that the canister is made from very, very
strong materials that are normally very, very

00:44:04.470 --> 00:44:11.690
expensive to make. You don't wanna put it
in a small tank that is explosive and so forth.

00:44:11.690 --> 00:44:16.160
So I think that if we are to do it in the
United States we'll have to have very high

00:44:16.160 --> 00:44:21.740
safety standards that will make it much more
expensive, which is why I go back to the original

00:44:21.740 --> 00:44:28.330
argument that it's much easier to do it, to
take the gas and make it into alcohol and

00:44:28.330 --> 00:44:31.510
then use the alcohol in the existing platforms.

00:44:31.510 --> 00:44:36.440
&gt;&gt;commentator: So one thing you didn't mention
in the discussion of methanol, which I think

00:44:36.440 --> 00:44:44.180
is very relevant, is the fact that in the
last five or ten years we've seen a revolution

00:44:44.180 --> 00:44:51.430
in natural gas production in the United States
with horizontal drilling and shale gas.

00:44:51.430 --> 00:44:57.390
If you look on the Web you can find maps of
the U.S. with shale gas deposits that are

00:44:57.390 --> 00:45:03.730
really quite striking. Now there's some environmental
issues with respect to extraction here, but

00:45:03.730 --> 00:45:08.730
in general it looks like it would be very,
very easy for the U.S. to be completely energy

00:45:08.730 --> 00:45:15.260
sufficient, and indeed, an exporter of natural
gas using LNG technology.

00:45:15.260 --> 00:45:21.860
So what you're describing is quite feasible
in terms of domestic capability, I would say.

00:45:21.860 --> 00:45:28.680
&gt;&gt;Gal Luft: I think that the question to ask
is, look we got a gift. This country got a

00:45:28.680 --> 00:45:37.450
gift. It's like all of a sudden an uncle that
you never knew died and you find yourself

00:45:37.450 --> 00:45:40.820
with a big inheritance.

00:45:40.820 --> 00:45:49.160
Even in my book, I must admit, I wrote it
before this natural gas revolution started

00:45:49.160 --> 00:45:55.520
and I wasn't as bullish on natural gas as
I am today. So things happened very quickly,

00:45:55.520 --> 00:45:56.970
very suddenly.

00:45:56.970 --> 00:46:03.150
But the question to ask is, if we are to use
natural gas in transportation, what is the

00:46:03.150 --> 00:46:10.490
best way of doing it? How do we get the most
economic activity from each cubic meter of

00:46:10.490 --> 00:46:19.600
natural gas? How do we get the most energy
security value from each cubic meter of natural

00:46:19.600 --> 00:46:24.010
gas? How do we make the most environmental
value from each cubic meter of natural gas?

00:46:24.010 --> 00:46:29.020
And we have to look, because as you said there
is more than one way of using natural gas,

00:46:29.020 --> 00:46:35.180
and we have to sort of go into this analysis
to make sure that we don't squander this gift,

00:46:35.180 --> 00:46:43.650
that we really put it to use in the best way,
most efficient way so they can really utilize

00:46:43.650 --> 00:46:44.650
it in the best say.

00:46:44.650 --> 00:46:48.980
Because, after all, natural gas too is a finite
resource so we want it to last for as many

00:46:48.980 --> 00:46:52.560
years and move around as many people and goods.

00:46:52.560 --> 00:46:59.680
And that can be done, I think, the best way
through the conversion to liquids and later

00:46:59.680 --> 00:47:06.710
on when we have electric cars through production
of electricity, and then we can run those

00:47:06.710 --> 00:47:11.040
electric cars that are made from electricity,
made from, among other things, natural gas.

00:47:11.040 --> 00:47:13.681
&gt;&gt;commentator: Okay, well let me open this
up to questions.

00:47:13.681 --> 00:47:14.681
&gt;&gt;male #1: Sure. Some of what you're describing
in the upper level it sounds vaguely like

00:47:14.681 --> 00:47:15.681
a policy that's a lightning rod. And at war
time when lighting rod policies happen, but

00:47:15.681 --> 00:47:16.681
this seems like a lower grade. Is there an
equivalent of economic warfare or economic

00:47:16.681 --> 00:47:17.681
policy lightening rod that has been employed
in the past for example if you wanna roll

00:47:17.681 --> 00:47:18.681
out something like this. Because at first
you wanna do the car conversion, but then

00:47:18.681 --> 00:47:58.270
in order to really hammer the point home would
you have to have the capacity to supply the

00:47:58.270 --> 00:47:59.270
energy [inaudible] at least to a certain degree.

00:47:59.270 --> 00:48:00.270
&gt;&gt;commentator: So give a quick summary of
the question.

00:48:00.270 --> 00:48:03.150
&gt;&gt;Gal Luft: If I understand the question correctly,
you were looking for precedent, historical

00:48:03.150 --> 00:48:12.400
precedent of how we are able to break through
this political gridlock, I take it, to really

00:48:12.400 --> 00:48:17.320
impose a requirement on changes to the vehicle
platform.

00:48:17.320 --> 00:48:21.530
&gt;&gt;male #1: Right. It's an economic type of
precedent.

00:48:21.530 --> 00:48:25.800
&gt;&gt;Gal Luft: Well I think that first of all
the case of Brazil. I mean Brazil started

00:48:25.800 --> 00:48:33.560
their flex fuel vehicle exercise that brought
them to where they are today after the 1973

00:48:33.560 --> 00:48:38.740
embargo; they got a wakeup call. They realized
that they suffered a great deal as a result;

00:48:38.740 --> 00:48:45.530
they had a military dictatorship, it helped
in terms of decision making, but they no longer

00:48:45.530 --> 00:48:46.690
do. Now it's a democracy.

00:48:46.690 --> 00:48:51.190
But at the time they realized that they no
longer want to be in this situation that somebody

00:48:51.190 --> 00:48:55.970
stops the supply of oil and they don't wanna
have to face this vulnerability and they went

00:48:55.970 --> 00:48:56.970
down this road.

00:48:56.970 --> 00:49:02.560
And we have a number of precedents in this
country even that in time of war and there

00:49:02.560 --> 00:49:04.890
were all kind of mandates that were introduced.

00:49:04.890 --> 00:49:09.550
For example, the reason that we have FM radio;
you know it's by law you need to have an FM

00:49:09.550 --> 00:49:17.910
radio; that auto makers are by law required
to provide FM radio to every car that they

00:49:17.910 --> 00:49:28.440
sell. And that goes back to the Cold War when
the military had all kind of plans to expropriate

00:49:28.440 --> 00:49:32.930
frequencies, and they really wanted to make
sure that the public can remain informed in

00:49:32.930 --> 00:49:34.000
time of emergency.

00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:40.240
So we have those precedents in which national
security arguments, but today I think it's

00:49:40.240 --> 00:49:46.500
even easier because we have an auto industry
that's still living off our dime. And an auto

00:49:46.500 --> 00:49:51.790
industry that every time that oil prices go
up and they cannot sell those SUV's, they

00:49:51.790 --> 00:49:54.790
come to us and ask for our money to keep them
alive.

00:49:54.790 --> 00:50:00.061
So I think that one other thing we can do
is tell them, "Look guys you know if you want

00:50:00.061 --> 00:50:05.230
our money again you better give us something
in return. And the least you can do is give

00:50:05.230 --> 00:50:06.230
us fuel choice."

00:50:06.230 --> 00:50:13.500
&gt;&gt;commentator: One example that might be an
historical precedent is the Sputnik and then

00:50:13.500 --> 00:50:17.410
the race to the moon and there were billions
and billions of dollars committed in a peace

00:50:17.410 --> 00:50:23.500
time effort to achieve a technological goal.
So it can be done, it just has to be pitched

00:50:23.500 --> 00:50:24.500
in the right way.

00:50:24.500 --> 00:50:26.160
Question.

00:50:26.160 --> 00:50:32.560
&gt;&gt;male #2: [unintelligible]

00:50:32.560 --> 00:50:40.170
So my question is if I run out and buy a new
car right now, is it the case that I could

00:50:40.170 --> 00:50:45.380
go spend $100 and upgrade it, or it seems
like there might be other issues of emissions

00:50:45.380 --> 00:50:50.820
and stuff like that or is there some kind
of in between thing that the manufacturers

00:50:50.820 --> 00:50:59.390
can do so that if I wanna upgrade later? 'Cause
it seems like the futures market if the oil

00:50:59.390 --> 00:51:06.340
producing countries saw that we were gearing
up for this that would have an immediate impact

00:51:06.340 --> 00:51:07.910
on their behavior.

00:51:07.910 --> 00:51:14.830
&gt;&gt;Gal Luft: You're talking about aftermarket
conversions and it can be done. There are

00:51:14.830 --> 00:51:22.210
folks who sell those kits for few hundred
dollars. I think that of course technically

00:51:22.210 --> 00:51:27.040
it can be done; it will be more expensive
if it's done as an aftermarket than if it's

00:51:27.040 --> 00:51:33.620
done at the manufacture's level, which is
why I'm focusing on the manufacturers because

00:51:33.620 --> 00:51:39.400
I think that's the best way to put a lot of
cars in a very short time to start of this

00:51:39.400 --> 00:51:44.240
program of getting the infrastructure to follow
and the investors in alternative fuels to

00:51:44.240 --> 00:51:48.510
follow, because they need some certainly as
well.

00:51:48.510 --> 00:51:53.410
But I think that as we go forward on this,
there'll probably be all kinds of entrepreneurs

00:51:53.410 --> 00:51:58.720
that will buy used cars and ship them, I don't
know to Mexico or China and have them go through

00:51:58.720 --> 00:52:01.330
a retrofit and sell the engine back to the
U.S. market.

00:52:01.330 --> 00:52:10.520
We could see all that, but our focus now is
to get the auto makers to produce those cars

00:52:10.520 --> 00:52:16.560
and to make sure that they produce it in such
a way that is not only warranted to run on

00:52:16.560 --> 00:52:21.960
ethanol, but is also warranted to run on methanol,
because methanol is the most corrosive of

00:52:21.960 --> 00:52:26.030
all alcohols. If a car can run on methanol,
it can run on all the other alcohols and the

00:52:26.030 --> 00:52:27.320
ethers.

00:52:27.320 --> 00:52:36.330
&gt;&gt;male #3: So I wanted to ask you how much
rare earth and other rare minerals are getting

00:52:36.330 --> 00:52:38.140
into the production of the cars themselves?

00:52:38.140 --> 00:52:39.140
&gt;&gt;Gal Luft: How many?

00:52:39.140 --> 00:52:44.430
&gt;&gt;male #3: How much of the rare earth and
other rare minerals are required to produce

00:52:44.430 --> 00:52:48.400
the cars themselves? And aren't we running
into the same problem with production of any

00:52:48.400 --> 00:52:49.400
car?

00:52:49.400 --> 00:52:56.200
&gt;&gt;Gal Luft: Yeah, first of all there are already
a lot of applications in your car and in your

00:52:56.200 --> 00:53:03.380
home and in everything around us. You know
those monitors have rare earth, fluorescent

00:53:03.380 --> 00:53:06.880
lights have rare earth, but of course also
the car.

00:53:06.880 --> 00:53:11.530
And that depends on the car; it depends on
the type of battery. Each battery has different

00:53:11.530 --> 00:53:21.410
rare earth. For example, if you have a nickel-metal
hydride battery you probably have more lanthanum.

00:53:21.410 --> 00:53:28.900
If you have lithium-ion battery you probably
gonna have more neodymium; so each battery

00:53:28.900 --> 00:53:32.950
chemistry requires different materials.

00:53:32.950 --> 00:53:38.800
Just to give you a sense, we're talking something
like a Toyota Prius something in the order

00:53:38.800 --> 00:53:47.290
of 20 kilos of cumulative rare earth, which
is quite a lot if you think about a market

00:53:47.290 --> 00:53:55.520
of about 170,000 tons globally. And we'll
need much more of it as we move into bigger

00:53:55.520 --> 00:53:56.570
and bigger applications.

00:53:56.570 --> 00:54:00.010
&gt;&gt;commentator: Let me ask a question about
ethanol.

00:54:00.010 --> 00:54:07.650
So as I understand it, a car now with no modifications
can burn up to 10 percent mix of ethanol with

00:54:07.650 --> 00:54:08.650
gasoline, right?

00:54:08.650 --> 00:54:09.650
&gt;&gt;Gal Luft: Yes.

00:54:09.650 --> 00:54:14.010
&gt;&gt;commentator: And so if you applied the modification,
this $100 modification you were describing,

00:54:14.010 --> 00:54:18.370
you could have a larger fraction of ethanol
in the fuel mix?

00:54:18.370 --> 00:54:20.360
&gt;&gt;Gal Luft: Just like the coffee and the milk,
remember?

00:54:20.360 --> 00:54:21.360
&gt;&gt;commentator: You get much larger?

00:54:21.360 --> 00:54:22.460
&gt;&gt;Gal Luft: Much, well --

00:54:22.460 --> 00:54:23.510
&gt;&gt;commentator: Substantially larger?

00:54:23.510 --> 00:54:29.120
&gt;&gt;Gal Luft: Well at least 85 percent and in
places like Brazil you could do 100 percent.

00:54:29.120 --> 00:54:33.610
The reason that we can go up to 85 is because
of the cold temperatures in the winter.

00:54:33.610 --> 00:54:42.420
But certainly you can use up to 85 percent
alcohol.

00:54:42.420 --> 00:54:47.440
And it's the kind of thing that consumers
will decide. We would like to see, for example,

00:54:47.440 --> 00:54:51.740
the concept of a blended pump. The blended
pump is sort of like those ice cream machines

00:54:51.740 --> 00:54:55.940
that you have a chocolate on the one hand
and the vanilla on the other and in the middle

00:54:55.940 --> 00:54:57.760
you have this one that sort of blends the
two.

00:54:57.760 --> 00:55:05.310
A blended pump will do the same. You'll come
to a gas station and you'll have a knob and

00:55:05.310 --> 00:55:10.830
you'll be able to determine what blend you
want to have in your tank.

00:55:10.830 --> 00:55:14.650
And I think that you will make the decision
or the gas station probably will make the

00:55:14.650 --> 00:55:21.490
decision based on the daily economics of the
fuels. So one day when gasoline is up and

00:55:21.490 --> 00:55:27.420
alcohol is down they will shift the knob towards
the alcohol and then you'll get more alcohol

00:55:27.420 --> 00:55:31.310
in your tank. The beauty of it is that the
car doesn't really care. So you can really

00:55:31.310 --> 00:55:33.490
mix it in any combination.

00:55:33.490 --> 00:55:39.010
To your point about the 10 percent: one of
the problems we have today with ethanol is

00:55:39.010 --> 00:55:43.940
because there is a blend wall; you can only
blend 10 percent, there is no justification

00:55:43.940 --> 00:55:49.120
to grow the ethanol industry. The ethanol
industry cannot grow anymore because they

00:55:49.120 --> 00:55:53.960
have hit this blend wall and in fact, they're
exporting this stuff now. So America became

00:55:53.960 --> 00:56:01.760
the next ethanol exporter because the market
is saturated, which is why we need to remove

00:56:01.760 --> 00:56:05.500
this blend wall altogether and the way to
remove this blend wall is to make sure we

00:56:05.500 --> 00:56:06.541
move to flex fuel cars.

00:56:06.541 --> 00:56:11.890
&gt;&gt;commentator: So it sounds like the political
support from the ethanol lobby would be there

00:56:11.890 --> 00:56:17.780
for this proposal, and on top of it you would
have strong political support from the natural

00:56:17.780 --> 00:56:24.420
gas industry because natural gas is also dramatically
lower in price. People are looking for ways

00:56:24.420 --> 00:56:25.430
to increase consumption.

00:56:25.430 --> 00:56:30.380
&gt;&gt;Gal Luft: I call this the triple A: the
American Alcohol Alliance.

00:56:30.380 --> 00:56:32.370
&gt;&gt;commentator: [laughs] I'll join. [laughs]

00:56:32.370 --> 00:56:40.850
&gt;&gt;Gal Luft: And indeed that's the vision that
I have to marry the traditional farm groups

00:56:40.850 --> 00:56:46.750
with the natural gas industry and have them
all support a vehicle platform that can accommodate

00:56:46.750 --> 00:56:51.850
the alcohol that is made in the Midwest and
the alcohol that is made in the natural gas,

00:56:51.850 --> 00:56:54.350
or that will be made hopefully in the natural
gas states.

00:56:54.350 --> 00:56:58.850
And also the alcohol that will be brought
from friendly countries like Brazil. I mean

00:56:58.850 --> 00:57:04.200
let's face it, why is it that we don't have
tax on imported oil but we have tax on imported

00:57:04.200 --> 00:57:10.190
alternative fuel? If you wanna import today
ethanol from Brazil you pay 54 cents a gallon.

00:57:10.190 --> 00:57:13.440
It's crazy.

00:57:13.440 --> 00:57:17.970
So we have to open the market and then we
don't need this protectionism because the

00:57:17.970 --> 00:57:20.160
market will be big enough for everybody to
profit.;

00:57:20.160 --> 00:57:24.570
&gt;&gt;commentator: Let's take another question
back there. Yes.

00:57:24.570 --> 00:57:25.570
You can just ?

00:57:25.570 --> 00:57:29.530
male #4: Okay.

00:57:29.530 --> 00:57:33.820
&gt;&gt;commentator: go ahead.

00:57:33.820 --> 00:57:38.110
&gt;&gt;male #4: [unintelligible]

00:57:38.110 --> 00:57:47.350
&gt;&gt;Gal Luft: Yeah, it's a question that I get
asked a lot about food versus fuel. If we

00:57:47.350 --> 00:57:51.910
produce ethanol how is that gonna affect food
production?

00:57:51.910 --> 00:57:58.030
Well I think that the anti-ethanol industry
has done a very good job in instilling this

00:57:58.030 --> 00:58:03.840
food versus fuel myth. The Congressional Research
Service looked into it, as well as the World

00:58:03.840 --> 00:58:09.380
Bank, by the way, and they concluded it's
certainly not true.

00:58:09.380 --> 00:58:14.450
The fact that food prices went up in 2008
was primarily driven by the fact that oil

00:58:14.450 --> 00:58:23.450
prices went up. And in fact food prices today
are cheaper; the growth in food prices is

00:58:23.450 --> 00:58:30.410
the slowest in more than 20 years even though
ethanol production is growing.

00:58:30.410 --> 00:58:39.060
The reality is that there are two answers
here. One is that not every form of ethanol

00:58:39.060 --> 00:58:48.070
can and must be made from food. Certainly
today we make ethanol from corn and in some

00:58:48.070 --> 00:58:53.660
places from sugar cane, but we can make ethanol
from lots of other feed stocks that don't

00:58:53.660 --> 00:58:59.430
conflict with food crops.

00:58:59.430 --> 00:59:09.960
The second thing that I would say about this
is that corn is like any other commodity.

00:59:09.960 --> 00:59:15.560
When there is a rush on commodities you'll
see that the rise in corn prices follows the

00:59:15.560 --> 00:59:23.060
rise of gold, the rise of silver, the rise
of sugar, oil, natural gas, you name it. All

00:59:23.060 --> 00:59:27.140
commodities go up; all commodities go down.

00:59:27.140 --> 00:59:35.370
What we use the ethanol for, the corn for
in the ethanol industry, we use the sugars.

00:59:35.370 --> 00:59:42.090
In food we use the proteins. So when you look
at the corn you have sugars and proteins.

00:59:42.090 --> 00:59:48.020
We do not use the sugars, we do not use the
sugars in our food production we use the proteins.

00:59:48.020 --> 00:59:50.780
And therefore they're two separate issues.

00:59:50.780 --> 00:59:56.010
If you go to an ethanol plant, you'll see
that they separate the sugars from the proteins;

00:59:56.010 --> 01:00:01.530
they take the proteins, they feed it to cows;
and they take the sugars and they refine it

01:00:01.530 --> 01:00:04.670
into ethanol. So there shouldn't be any conflict
here.

01:00:04.670 --> 01:00:10.040
The fact that you hear about bread riots in
Egypt and tortilla riots in Mexico, that's

01:00:10.040 --> 01:00:17.400
not because of ethanol. It is not. In fact
why should there be bread riots in Egypt if

01:00:17.400 --> 01:00:21.190
we don't make ethanol from wheat?

01:00:21.190 --> 01:00:27.900
So it was a political ploy that was very well
orchestrated and we know today that it was

01:00:27.900 --> 01:00:28.930
completely fabricated.

01:00:28.930 --> 01:00:33.790
&gt;&gt;commentator: So I think we're running short
of time here.

01:00:33.790 --> 01:00:39.660
Gal you will be around for at least a half
hour or so signing books and you can ask any

01:00:39.660 --> 01:00:41.690
of these remaining questions personally.

01:00:41.690 --> 01:00:42.960
So thank you very much for coming.

01:00:42.960 --> 01:00:43.960
&gt;&gt;Gal Luft: Thank you.

01:00:43.960 --> 01:00:47.550
[applause]
