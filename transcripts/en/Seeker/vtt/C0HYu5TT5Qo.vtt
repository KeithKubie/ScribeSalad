00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.050
No matter how seasoned a flier you are, turbulence
knocking you around can send your heart into

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:05.050
your throat.

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:10.150
It’s rarely fatal, but still: what’s the
deal with airplane turbulence?

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:15.519
Hey guys, Amy here with you on DNews.

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:19.550
If you’ve ever flown in an airplane, you’ve
probably felt turbulence, that disconcerting

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:22.390
shaking that makes you feel like you’re
about to fall out of the sky.

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:24.789
So aside from scary, what is turbulence?

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:27.640
Turbulence is usually the result of jet streams.

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.000
Jet Streams are the fast, narrow currents
of air that travel around our planet.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.720
They can sometimes be thousands of miles long,
but they’re usually only a few miles wide

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:35.720
and deep.

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:39.230
We know, more or less, where the jet streams
are and in what direction they’re traveling,

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:43.730
and flight planners either send a plane flying
against a jet stream (fly into a headwind)

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:48.120
or with a jet stream (fly with a tailwind)
on a commercial flight.

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.890
But like a river hitting the river bank, jet
streams interact with slower moving air.

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:56.180
And this mixing of air traveling at two different
speeds causes a kind of turbulence called

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.440
Clear Air Turbulence because, well, you can’t
see it.

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.580
When a plane flies on a heading that takes
it through this mixing air, it hits turbulence.

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:07.060
And the danger of Clear Air Turbulence is
that it can come out of nowhere.

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.860
It’s also possible for an airplane to hit
turbulence when flying in the wake of another

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.610
airplane, though this usually affects a smaller
plane flying behind larger planes.

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.440
An airplane whips up air in its wake, and
flying through that air can make for a bumpy

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:19.440
ride.

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:22.730
And of course flying through stormy weather
with winds whipping all around can also lead

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:23.900
to a turbulent flight.

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:24.900
The good news?

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.920
Turbulence just feels scarier than it is.

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.770
It’s easy to imagine, on a turbulent flight,
that you’re in a dinghy being battered around

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:33.500
by a stormy sea, but a plane isn’t a boat.

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.850
Turbulence can either be mild, moderate, or
severe.

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.940
When it’s moderate, the plane’s altitude,
bank angle, and pitch might vary by a few

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:44.630
tens of feet, but any change in its heading,
its direction of travel, will be barely noticeable.

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.750
Planes are designed to return to their original
position in space if knocked to the side by

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:49.750
winds.

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:52.600
Severe turbulence can knock service carts
over and send you flying out of your seat

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:53.750
if you aren’t wearing your seatbelt.

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.659
In fact, that’s actually where you’re
going to run into trouble.

00:01:56.659 --> 00:01:59.970
If the plane is bouncing around and you’re
not wearing your seatbelt, you could be thrown

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:01.130
hard enough to get hurt.

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.880
But turbulence alone isn’t going to make
an airplane plummet.

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.670
Airframes are engineered to meet stress limits
of both positive and negative G-loads.

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:11.890
The wings will flex, but that’s a good thing.Turbulence
strong enough to dislodge an engine or snap

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:15.370
a wing is something most travelers and pilots
won’t experience in their lifetimes.

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.920
So it’s really just a comfort issue.

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.580
Pilots study weather charts, radar data, and
real-time reports from other aircraft to avoid

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.890
turbulence so you can have that coffee in
a cup and not on your lap.

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.490
But still, it’s best to keep that seatbelt
fastened for when Clear Air Turbulence strikes.

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:32.170
So, do you guys have any horror stories of
terrifyingly turbulent flights?
