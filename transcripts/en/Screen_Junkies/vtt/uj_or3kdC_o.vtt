00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:11.560
From the studio they could
really use a new franchise,

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:13.340
now The Divergent
crashed and burned onto TV.

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.140
Comes the reboot that asks...

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:18.060
What if we took the Power Rangers.

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:20.100
Seriously? Uh, oh.

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.320
If you love The Breakfast Club,

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.200
but wished they all turned
into ninjas at the end.

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.320
Then this is the movie for you.

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:33.360
As these teenagers stuck in detention spend 90 minutes
bonding with each other.

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.080
"I'm Zack, and I am a Power Ranger"

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:36.680
"Hi, Zack."

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:37.980
"Hi, Zack."

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.160
Followed by a generic 30-minute episode
of the Power Rangers TV show.

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.340
Man, I wish they'd kept the focus off the robot battles
and onto The Power Rangers family issues.

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:47.220
What's Trini gonna say to her parents?!

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:48.960
Is Zack's mom gonna be okay?

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:52.880
And what timeline am I living in where these are the questions
I have about The Power Rangers?

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.800
Forget everything you know about
Jason, Zack, Kimberley, Billy, and Trini.

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.100
Except their names.

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.160
Because these five teenagers have so much attitude.

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.120
You'll swear adults just pulled 
random edgy traits out of a hat.

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.020
Like... Death metal yoga lesbian.

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:10.200
Cliff diving cheerleaders sexter.

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:10.820
"Whoa."

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.620
Trailer park Asian wildcard hobo.

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:16.160
"Camping out on old trains,
I see you too, homeboy."

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.420
Autistic black country music loving hacker?

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:20.580
"I love country music."

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.060
And the uh... Guy who doesn't 
want to play football.

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:24.660
"(trophy snaps)"

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:27.200
Why not go with that bully 
that looks like Ed Sheeran?

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.400
Or at least Jason's friend 
who jerked off a cow?

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.300
"I just milked her."

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:30.840
"Him."

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.580
Now that's tude.

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.200
Fan-favorite Zordon will return...

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.800
Thanks to half a day in a
VO booth with Bryan Cranston.

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:40.040
"You need me."

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:41.940
He's here to do two things...

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:44.420
Dumb loads of exposition on the audience.

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:49.420
"Power Rangers were a legion of warriors
sworn to protect life."

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.100
"You must become those warriors."

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:53.400
And...

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.160
Okay, he's only here to do one thing.

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.180
"She will create Goldar."

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.080
"A huge monster who will 
rip the crystal from the Earth."

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.280
"And all life on..."

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.260
Together The Rangers will
battle Rita Repulsa.

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.020
A fresh new take on
Austin Power's Goldmember.

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.740
"Gold."

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.120
"I need gold."

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:10.880
"I'm interested in gold."

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:14.060
"I love gold."

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.740
She's got a plan
to destroy the world.

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:20.940
And it all centers around the most blatant
product placement in movie history.

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.160
"It's a Krispy Kreme."

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:23.000
"(whispers) Krispy Kreme?"

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.220
"Krispy Kreme? This is a special place?"

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:26.440
"We gotta go to Krispy Kreme."

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:27.660
"Krispy Kreme!"

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.120
"We haven't found Krispy Kreme yet."

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.260
"You circle the Krispy Kreme
and make sure it's safe."

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.800
Hmmmm... I could really go
for some dunkin' right now.

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.800
"(Goldar crushes roof)"

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.560
So gear up for a movie that's more
than a remake of a kids show.

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.360
Because buried under its
many cheesy moments.

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:44.600
"It's just me and my mom."

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.140
"My mom is the best!"

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:47.800
Cheesy looking Zords.

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:51.640
And cheesy message about how the real
Power Ranger was inside you all along.

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.560
"I knew it! We do get armor."

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.260
"You already have it inside you."

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.400
Lies a really good high school drama
that's worth exploring in a sequel.

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:03.020
Maybe one about them rebuilding Angel Grove
because they really messed that place up.

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:04.360
"(ground shaking)"

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:05.400
"(Zord crashes)"

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:06.820
"(explosing)"

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:08.480
"(cheering and applauding)"

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.360
Why are you cheering?
Your town is in ruins!

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:44.120
Hey look it's the White Power Ranger!
Wait...

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:45.480
White Power Ranger?

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:46.600
That don't sound right.
