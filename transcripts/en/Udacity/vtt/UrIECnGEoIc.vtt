00:00:03.506 --> 00:00:06.685
The Georgia Tech OMSCS program
launched in January of 2014,

00:00:06.685 --> 00:00:10.770
with the ultimate goal of creating
a more accessible master's program.

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:12.260
We wanted everyone who wants and

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:15.480
deserves a Georgia Tech master's
in CS to be able to get one.

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.090
We wanted to tear down the obstacles
that usually prevent people

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:19.780
from participating in
a program like this one.

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:22.110
And this program has really
allowed us to do so.

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:24.095
We've removed the obstacle of geography.

00:00:24.095 --> 00:00:27.900
We have students from every state and
from 77 different countries.

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.360
We've removed the obstacle
of availability.

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:32.880
Most of our students are completely
the program while still holding down

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.930
full time jobs and managing their
families and other obligations.

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.670
We've removed the obstacle of capacity,
our online classes can hold far more

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:43.010
students than we could
ever handle in person.

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:47.010
And perhaps most importantly, we've
greatly reduced the obstacle of cost.

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.200
This program costs a fraction of the
amount of traditional on-campus program.

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.083
&gt;&gt; I actually live here in Atlanta, and

00:00:53.083 --> 00:00:55.285
I work just a couple
of blocks from campus.

00:00:55.285 --> 00:00:59.381
I participate in the online program
because of all of these benefits, it's

00:00:59.381 --> 00:01:03.925
much more affordable than a traditional
on-campus program and more importantly,

00:01:03.925 --> 00:01:07.800
I don't have to take two years off
of work to get a master's here.

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.460
&gt;&gt; We've made enormous efforts to make
this program accessible because we

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:12.950
wanted to reach a broader
audience of students.

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:16.150
But in making the program accessible,
something interesting has happened.

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:18.915
Because you can complete the program,
without taking time off work,

00:01:18.915 --> 00:01:22.955
it's attracted executives, scientists,
people in incredibly prominent positions

00:01:22.955 --> 00:01:25.485
in research and
industry from around the world.

00:01:25.485 --> 00:01:28.705
Because the cost of the program is so
low, it's attracted people that don't

00:01:28.705 --> 00:01:31.025
view the program simply
as a career investment.

00:01:31.025 --> 00:01:34.425
It attracts people who are here
solely because they love to learn.

00:01:34.425 --> 00:01:36.880
And because we can take a much
larger number of students,

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.910
the program has attracted an incredibly
diverse population of people.

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:43.410
&gt;From career programmers to people
working in completely different domains,

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:45.730
who think that Java is
coffee from Indonesia and

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:47.260
python is a snake in Africa.

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.310
The accessibility of this program has
allowed it to attract an incredible

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.200
population of students.

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.140
And it's the student ownership and

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.770
investment into the program that has
truly made it something special.

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.800
I love my job because I get to work
with some of the most engaged, curious,

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:01.490
and passionate students I've ever met.

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:04.020
And they'll be your classmates.

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.680
In the OMSCS program,

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.800
you'll quite likely learn more from
each other than you ever will from us.

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.798
And that's what makes this
program truly special.
