00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.043
Now you've had some time to play around with logs. So, let's get back to

00:00:04.043 --> 00:00:07.659
thinking about how to graph them. We're going to need to think about their

00:00:07.659 --> 00:00:12.080
domain and range and any special points on the graph. So to get closer to doing

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:16.898
that, I have a question for you, and that question is. What do you think will

00:00:16.898 --> 00:00:22.850
happen if we try to find log base 10 of 0? I'll give you some choices. Your

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:28.389
options are, it's 0. It's 1. Are you trying to trick me? 0 isn't in the domain

00:00:28.389 --> 00:00:32.493
of f of x, equals 10 to the x, so it can't be in the domain of log base 10 of

00:00:32.493 --> 00:00:38.825
x. Or finally, are you trying to trick me? 0 isn't in the range of f of x

00:00:38.825 --> 00:00:44.328
equals 10 to the x, so it can't be in the domain of log base 10 of x.
