00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.270
JAMES GRIME: It's maths news.

00:00:01.270 --> 00:00:02.750
We all love maths news, right?

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:06.240
So recently the Abel Prize
was announced.

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.150
The Abel Prize is like the Nobel
Prize for mathematics.

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:12.470
So the winner of this
year's Abel

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:15.700
Prize was Endre Szemeredi.

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:17.580
And he's a Hungarian
mathematician.

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.060
It's in recognition of a
career in mathematics.

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.860
And so, for that he has won six
million Norwegian krone.

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:28.900
That's about $1 million.

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:30.250
So for this video--

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:32.910
and we always like to attach
a number to our video--

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.700
we're going to use the
number 6,000,000.

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.360
DAVID HODGE: The prize itself
only started in 2003.

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.460
But it's now being seen as the
mathematics Nobel Prize.

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:46.010
There was a prize called the
Fields Medal for mathematics,

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:47.220
which has been around
much longer.

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:49.310
JAMES GRIME: There's the Fields
medal which is really

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:51.010
for young mathematicians.

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:54.800
Young mathematicians,
for us, is under 40.

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.020
The Abel Prize has no
restriction like that.

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.180
So it is more directly
comparable

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.680
to the Nobel Prizes.

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.900
DAVID HODGE: There is a fair
amount of publicity about it.

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:05.940
So it's awarded in Norway,
and some people fly

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:07.490
over for the ceremony.

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:10.400
JAMES GRIME: There is no Nobel
Prize for mathematics.

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.460
There are some stories about
that, and maybe I'll save

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:14.400
those to the end.

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.860
I like to end with
an anti-climax.

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.390
DAVID HODGE: So surname
Szemeredi--

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.480
S-Z-E-M-E-R-E-D-I, first
name Endre--

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.090
so quite difficult to pronounce,
like many of the

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:30.750
Hungarian mathematicians.

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.620
He's now in his 70s.

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:37.850
He's published over 200 papers
in a wide variety of areas.

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:41.480
In particular, lots of
applications to graph theory,

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:44.240
and applications to number
theory, and including computer

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.320
science, sorting algorithms.

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:52.030
I'll talk today about some of
the applications in what

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:53.720
sounds a bit like number theory
to do with counting

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.870
sets of integers with
certain properties.

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:59.800
So I'm going to talk about
what's now called Szemeredi's

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:01.990
theorem, though it used to
be called the Erdos-Turan

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:05.340
conjecture, which stood
for 30 or 40 years.

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.300
And, because of the importance
of the result, and the ways in

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.910
which Szemeredi proved it,
the result has now

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:12.200
taken on his name.

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.860
JAMES GRIME: One of his big
theorems is now named after

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.370
Szemeredi, so it's Szemeredi's
theorem.

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.070
And it's about finding structure
in randomness.

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:23.070
So this is what we're
going to look at.

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:25.300
We're going to look at something
called arithmetic

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:26.020
progressions.

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.980
DAVID HODGE: Integers--
we're thinking about

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:28.190
patterns within integers.

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:29.900
So suppose I take a
list of integers.

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.565
I'll try and list
a few of them.

00:02:32.565 --> 00:02:34.380
1, 6, 7--

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:35.840
there, I've chosen
six numbers.

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:39.280
But, unfortunately, what's
happened is I've chosen them

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:44.110
in such a way that 1, 4, 7,
10 form what's called an

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:45.750
arithmetic progression.

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.590
So it's a progression where the
gaps between the numbers

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:49.830
is the same at every step.

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.420
What we're going to try and do
now is we're going to try to

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.940
choose the numbers, and
avoid these patterns.

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:58.170
So I'm going to choose some
numbers between 1 and 15.

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:59.930
Let's focus just on patterns
of length three.

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:02.933
So a pattern where you've got a
number, a second number, and

00:03:02.933 --> 00:03:05.105
a third number, where the gap
between the first and second

00:03:05.105 --> 00:03:06.610
number is the same as
the gap between the

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:07.310
second and third number.

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:09.680
Like 1, 4, 7 or 4, 7, 10.

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.100
So I'll choose 1.

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.865
I'll choose 2.

00:03:11.865 --> 00:03:14.040
Now, I can't choose 3, because
I'd have a pattern

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:14.430
immediately.

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.070
So let's choose 4.

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:18.510
I can't choose 6, because then
we'd have 2, 4, 6, which forms

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.000
a pattern of three in a row
with the same difference.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.540
So I can't have 6.

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:23.150
Can I have 5?

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:24.160
Yes, I'll have 5.

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.770
I can't have 7, because 1,
4, 7 would be a pattern.

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:29.690
And I'm starting to struggle
to find numbers.

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:30.780
I have to start going to 8.

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.055
So I go to 8.

00:03:32.055 --> 00:03:32.910
Have I managed it?

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:35.440
Oh, no, I've already failed.

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.360
I tried, but I failed, because
2, 5, 8 was a pattern.

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:41.230
It's actually quite difficult
to choose numbers without

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:42.340
avoiding certain patterns.

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:43.900
We're going to try to move
towards what Szemeredi's

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:44.600
theorem says.

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:45.725
So let's try and avoid 3.

00:03:45.725 --> 00:03:46.940
So let's choose k.

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:48.580
That's going to be equal to 3.

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:50.170
That's the length of
a sequence I'm

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:51.820
going to try and avoid.

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:54.650
And the rules are, we're going
to have to choose numbers from

00:03:54.650 --> 00:04:01.384
the list 1, 2, 3, up to some
enormous number, n--

00:04:01.384 --> 00:04:04.190
very large number, n-- for
example, 1,000,000.

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:06.795
So we're going to try and choose
numbers from 1 to a

00:04:06.795 --> 00:04:08.455
million, just like we chose
numbers before.

00:04:08.455 --> 00:04:10.470
And we're going to try and
avoid having any three

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:12.440
somewhere which have got
a common difference.

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:14.140
Now, obviously we're not going
to do that now, because there

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:16.279
are far too many numbers
to choose from.

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:19.170
But what Szemeredi said is,
actually, it's surprisingly

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:21.680
few numbers that you're allowed
to choose before

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:24.160
you're forced to
have a pattern.

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:29.040
One way to describe his theorem
is, I ask you for some

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:34.510
percentage, and you
give me 1%.

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:36.650
1% is going to be what
percentage of the numbers I'm

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:37.640
going to offer you, that you're

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:38.660
going to have to choose.

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:39.640
Let's go more advanced.

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:41.230
Let's choose k is 4.

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:43.760
That means we're going to have
to try and avoid having four

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:45.920
numbers in the sequence,
somewhere, which have all got

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:47.360
a common difference--

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:55.310
like 10, 20, 30, 40, or 100,
1,000, 1,900, 2,800.

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:59.830
I could also put in 45,
50, 55, and 60.

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:01.130
And I've messed up.

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:03.590
And what Szemeredi said--

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:04.280
so here's Szemeredi.

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:07.700
He comes along and gives us some
completely insanely large

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:13.090
number, which might be 10
to the 10 to the 10.

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:15.020
This is going to be how
many numbers you

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:16.090
get to choose from.

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:17.400
So I'm now going to give
you the exercise.

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:20.080
You've got to choose 1% of the
numbers from this list, and

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:22.760
try and avoid a sequence
of length 4.

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:24.630
You won't manage it.

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:26.050
Szemeredi's cleverly--

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:29.880
his theorem says that if you
chose any percentage, and any

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:32.830
k, he can come back with a
number that says, if you

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:36.200
choose even 1% of those
numbers, you will have

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:38.980
accidentally, at some point,
chosen four numbers in your

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:41.930
list with a common difference
between them.

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:44.420
So you probably say, this is
all very well, but 1% maybe

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:45.540
was too many.

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:47.940
And k equals 4-- that
was quite a short

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:49.470
list to try and avoid.

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:51.980
Actually, even if you'd given me
a ludicrous percentage-- if

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:53.530
you'd given me a tiny
percentage--

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:56.110
0.001%.

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:58.400
So at the end of this game, I'm
going to give you a list

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:02.890
of numbers, and you can choose
0.001% of them-- that's very,

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:04.050
very few of them.

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:06.400
And even if we'd then chosen
k to be something else,

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:09.064
something much larger--
say k is 100.

00:06:09.064 --> 00:06:12.460
k is 100 means all you've got
to do is avoid having 100

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:14.780
numbers where the common
difference is the

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:16.320
same all the way along.

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:17.950
Now, you'd think that was
really easy to avoid.

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:19.680
You'd think you could
manage that.

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:22.660
Szemeredi says, OK, give
me your percentage.

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:24.080
Give me your k.

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:28.420
He'll go away, come back from
his theorem, and he's going to

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:29.280
give you another number
on the end.

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:32.680
His number's going to
be even larger--

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:34.940
some completely insane number.

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:35.970
But it's a number.

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:38.950
You won't manage
to avoid this--

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:41.290
what seems like a very
unlikely thing.

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:44.750
And this is true for any
percentage and for any k.

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:45.970
MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): Did
Szemeredi come up with an

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:49.250
equation that you could plug
that number into, and that

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:51.010
number into, to give
you that number?

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:52.312
Is there an equation?

00:06:52.312 --> 00:06:53.610
DAVID HODGE: If only.

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:53.940
No.

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:58.710
So, a lot of the results in this
area have this strangely

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:00.310
non-constructive
proof to them.

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:02.870
So the actual proof, itself,
doesn't even

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:03.495
give you the number.

00:07:03.495 --> 00:07:06.060
It purely says, there
must be a number.

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:07.670
MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): You
said if I came up with any

00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:10.960
percentage, and any k, Szemeredi
would come back to

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:11.890
me with a number.

00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:14.040
Are you now saying Szemeredi,
actually, he

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:15.300
couldn't give me a number.

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:16.885
He could just tell me
a number exists.

00:07:16.885 --> 00:07:19.600
DAVID HODGE: He could tell
you a number exists.

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:23.460
There have been results since
his work for which people have

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:26.160
managed to give an upper
band on this number.

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:28.720
In which case, they could,
now, give you a number.

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:29.810
MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): The
one thing that troubles me

00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:32.450
here is, there are an
infinite number of

00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:33.860
numbers, aren't there?

00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:34.490
DAVID HODGE: Yep.

00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:37.020
MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): So I
could have told you that no

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:39.280
matter what you put there, and
no matter what you put there,

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:41.565
there'll be a number there
eventually, because there are

00:07:41.565 --> 00:07:43.600
an infinite number of numbers
that could go there.

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:45.520
So why has Szemeredi
been clever?

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:48.310
DAVID HODGE: So suppose you
took all the numbers.

00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:50.970
Suppose we go 1, 2, 3--

00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:52.690
now this list goes on forever.

00:07:52.690 --> 00:07:55.890
So this is all the integers
you know.

00:07:55.890 --> 00:08:00.120
What Szemeredi's result tells
us is that if you gave me a

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:01.080
percentage--

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:03.340
so, again, let's choose
a percentage.

00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:05.920
This time we'll go for something
slightly bigger--

00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:08.490
0.01%.

00:08:08.490 --> 00:08:12.590
If I asked you to choose a list
of integers, it's going

00:08:12.590 --> 00:08:13.530
to be a very long list,
because you've

00:08:13.530 --> 00:08:16.040
got to choose 0.01%.

00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:17.710
You're still going to have to
choose infinitely many, but

00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:20.860
you're going to choose about 1
in 10,000 of all the numbers.

00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:23.470
What Szemeredi's result tells
you is you are going to

00:08:23.470 --> 00:08:27.120
accidentally create
progressions,

00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:30.030
lists of all lengths--

00:08:30.030 --> 00:08:33.650
not just length 4, and 100, but
any possible length will

00:08:33.650 --> 00:08:36.799
appear in your list if all you
did was choose numbers, to

00:08:36.799 --> 00:08:39.859
arrange to choose about
a 10,000th of them.

00:08:39.859 --> 00:08:42.179
JAMES GRIME: So what I really
liked about this, though, is

00:08:42.179 --> 00:08:46.030
that this theorem was used
to prove another result--

00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:47.430
pretty much similar--

00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:49.210
but about prime numbers.

00:08:49.210 --> 00:08:51.465
Now, the prime numbers are
actually quite rare.

00:08:51.465 --> 00:08:53.890
They're unpredictable
and rare.

00:08:53.890 --> 00:08:56.010
So they have density zero.

00:08:56.010 --> 00:09:00.430
Now, you can't use Szemeredi's
theorem to prove the same

00:09:00.430 --> 00:09:03.400
result with the prime numbers,
because Szemeredi's theorem

00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:07.560
was about things that had
greater than zero density.

00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:12.240
But you could use his theorem
in the proof of this

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:13.220
statement--

00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:17.250
the prime numbers have
arithmetic progressions.

00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:19.910
So let's take the list
of prime numbers.

00:09:19.910 --> 00:09:21.080
We know the prime numbers.

00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:23.000
They're 2, and 3, and 5.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:24.370
They go on forever.

00:09:24.370 --> 00:09:26.480
They're rare and
unpredictable.

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:30.380
But still you can find
sequences, like the arithmetic

00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:34.830
progressions, of length 100,
of length 1,000,000,

00:09:34.830 --> 00:09:36.740
whatever you want.

00:09:36.740 --> 00:09:38.775
And that is surprising.

00:09:38.775 --> 00:09:41.322
There is structure
in the randomness

00:09:41.322 --> 00:09:42.640
of the prime numbers.

00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:45.800
An arithmetic sequence
in the prime numbers.

00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:47.270
Let's pick--

00:09:47.270 --> 00:09:48.970
I'm going to start with 5--

00:09:48.970 --> 00:09:50.130
that's a prime number.

00:09:50.130 --> 00:09:51.950
And I'm going to add on 6.

00:09:51.950 --> 00:09:52.685
That's 11.

00:09:52.685 --> 00:09:54.990
I'm going to add on 6 again.

00:09:54.990 --> 00:09:57.830
That is 17.

00:09:57.830 --> 00:09:58.870
That's a prime number.

00:09:58.870 --> 00:10:00.090
Add on 6 again.

00:10:00.090 --> 00:10:01.980
That's 23.

00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:03.660
Add on 6 again--

00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:06.310
that's 29.

00:10:06.310 --> 00:10:11.240
And that is an arithmetic
progression of length five

00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:12.900
just using prime numbers.

00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:15.460
The common difference is six.

00:10:15.460 --> 00:10:19.570
In this case, they are
called sexy primes.

00:10:19.570 --> 00:10:21.500
We're going to talk about
that, aren't we?

00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:25.090
Now, the theorem doesn't
guarantee what the common

00:10:25.090 --> 00:10:25.940
difference will be.

00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:27.350
You can't specify it.

00:10:27.350 --> 00:10:29.320
It doesn't tell you
where to start it.

00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:31.630
It doesn't even tell you
how to find them.

00:10:31.630 --> 00:10:34.520
But what I can guarantee you
is that I can give you a

00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:37.030
progression of any length.

00:10:37.030 --> 00:10:39.810
I can give you a progression
of length a million-- a

00:10:39.810 --> 00:10:41.795
billion, even.

00:10:41.795 --> 00:10:43.090
MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN):
But you can't tell me

00:10:43.090 --> 00:10:43.630
what the gap is?

00:10:43.630 --> 00:10:44.410
JAMES GRIME: I can't tell
you what the gap is.

00:10:44.410 --> 00:10:49.690
But imagine a progression of
a billion, just using prime

00:10:49.690 --> 00:10:53.030
numbers, where they have the
common difference the same all

00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:54.716
the way through.

00:10:54.716 --> 00:10:56.040
MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN):
And that's there?

00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:56.870
JAMES GRIME: And that
is in there.

00:10:56.870 --> 00:10:58.610
And that is guaranteed
to be in there.

00:10:58.610 --> 00:11:00.420
I can't tell you what
it is, but it's

00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:01.935
guaranteed to be in there.

00:11:01.935 --> 00:11:05.150
MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN):
Who figured that out?

00:11:05.150 --> 00:11:06.260
JAMES GRIME: Oh, who
figured that out?

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:07.990
Oh, the prime number version?

00:11:07.990 --> 00:11:08.760
Sorry.

00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:11.470
That was figured out by a
Cambridge mathematician called

00:11:11.470 --> 00:11:12.450
Tim Gowers.

00:11:12.450 --> 00:11:13.950
And he's around here
somewhere.

00:11:13.950 --> 00:11:15.110
He'll be in one of
these offices.

00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:15.470
MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN):
Really?

00:11:15.470 --> 00:11:16.790
JAMES GRIME: Yeah.

00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:17.680
MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN):
Well, let's go ask him.

00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:18.570
JAMES GRIME: Yeah.

00:11:18.570 --> 00:11:20.040
MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN):
Is this just

00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:21.240
crosswords and Sudoku?

00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:24.630
Is this just mathematicians
being unimaginably clever?

00:11:24.630 --> 00:11:27.670
Or is there a practical reason
for Szemeredi to do this?

00:11:27.670 --> 00:11:29.580
DAVID HODGE: So some of the
final results-- like this

00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:31.550
result-- it's not obvious
this has any particular

00:11:31.550 --> 00:11:33.110
applications.

00:11:33.110 --> 00:11:35.548
But what's definitely true is
that in order to get to these

00:11:35.548 --> 00:11:38.010
results, Szemeredi,
himself, proved

00:11:38.010 --> 00:11:40.060
particularly one famous result--

00:11:40.060 --> 00:11:44.050
what's called Szemeredi's
regularity lemma, which is now

00:11:44.050 --> 00:11:46.810
being used in a number of
different areas of maths, not

00:11:46.810 --> 00:11:52.070
just this fairly small area of
trying to count progressions.

00:11:52.070 --> 00:11:55.440
That's particularly one of
the reasons why he's been

00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:57.510
recognized.

00:11:57.510 --> 00:11:59.680
It's not just because he's
done one big thing.

00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:00.790
But he's done a number
of big things.

00:12:00.790 --> 00:12:04.020
And even to prove those big
things, he's developed a whole

00:12:04.020 --> 00:12:06.840
new area of theory, which
has been used by many

00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:07.730
people since him.

00:12:07.730 --> 00:12:10.560
JAMES GRIME: So there is no
Nobel Prize for maths.

00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:14.630
Now, the story that is told in
maths departments around the

00:12:14.630 --> 00:12:19.760
world is that Nobel, he didn't
give a Nobel Prize for

00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:22.530
mathematics-- or didn't set
one up-- because he hated

00:12:22.530 --> 00:12:27.380
mathematicians, and because
his wife ran off with a

00:12:27.380 --> 00:12:28.650
mathematician.

00:12:28.650 --> 00:12:30.870
And that's the story that
is told in math

00:12:30.870 --> 00:12:33.280
departments all over.

00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:36.590
The only problem is,
he wasn't married.

00:12:36.590 --> 00:12:37.820
And it's not true.

00:12:37.820 --> 00:12:39.240
It's not true.

00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:40.590
He, I guess, though--

00:12:40.590 --> 00:12:41.880
Nobel--

00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:45.300
didn't appreciate mathematics
enough to give it a prize.

00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:48.330
He was interested in physics
and chemistry.

00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:50.900
There isn't a Nobel Prize
for biology, either.

00:12:50.900 --> 00:12:52.950
So it's that reason.

00:12:52.950 --> 00:12:54.310
It's less exciting.

00:12:54.310 --> 00:12:55.670
I told you I wanted to end
with an anti-climax.
