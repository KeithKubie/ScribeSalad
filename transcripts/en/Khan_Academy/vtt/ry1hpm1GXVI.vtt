00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:03.320
What I want to do in this
video is revisit some ideas

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:05.630
that you've probably taken
for granted since the time

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:08.010
that you were like
three or four years old.

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.380
But hopefully, you'll kind
of view it in a new light,

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.130
and it'll help inform
us when we think

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:15.520
about other types
of number systems.

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:17.920
So we have 10 digits
in our number system.

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:19.170
So let me just start counting.

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.610
So if I have nothing,
I use the symbol 0.

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:23.730
Then if I have one object,
I use the symbol 1.

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.110
Actually, let me draw this out.

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:25.769
So nothing.

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.810
And then if I have one
thing, I use the symbol 1.

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.000
If I have two things,
I use the symbol 2.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.730
If I have three things,
I use the symbol 3.

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:36.230
Let me scroll down a little
bit, make sure you can see that.

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:40.760
If I have four things, I use
this symbol right over here.

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:45.900
If I have five things,
I use this symbol.

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:47.780
If I have six
things, I'll start--

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:49.980
let's draw it like that--
if I have six things,

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.670
I use that symbol.

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:55.567
If I have seven things,
I use that symbol.

00:00:55.567 --> 00:00:57.650
I know this might be getting
a little bit tedious,

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:58.920
but this all has a point.

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.650
If I have eight things,
I use this symbol.

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:09.940
And if I have nine
things, I use this symbol.

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:17.570
And then if I have 10 things, so
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:19.290
What symbol do I use?

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.400
I've already used
up my 10 digits.

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.090
We only have 10 digits
in a base 10 system.

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.860
So we start reusing them.

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.340
So what we do is we introduce
this idea of number places.

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.250
You say that I have
1 ten and 0 ones.

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:40.730
So you say you have 1
ten, and then 0 ones.

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:44.600
We call this 1, we say
it's in the tens place.

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:50.990
This is literally saying
1, this is saying 1 tens.

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:54.597
This is 1 tens plus 0 ones.

00:01:54.597 --> 00:01:57.180
So that's what this is saying,
but we didn't have to reuse it.

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.580
We could have had
maybe more symbols.

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:01.880
Maybe this was a
symbol, or maybe we

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.130
would have created a new
symbol, instead of, you know,

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:05.740
all of these had
their own symbol.

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:07.531
So instead of having
to reuse the old ones,

00:02:07.531 --> 00:02:11.816
maybe we could have made
the symbol star for 10.

00:02:11.816 --> 00:02:13.190
And then when you
go to 11, maybe

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:14.814
would have had another
symbol for that.

00:02:14.814 --> 00:02:17.180
Let me go to 11 just
to hit the point home.

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:22.950
So 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
7, 8, 9, 10, 11.

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:28.570
So 11 in our number system,
we say that this is 1 ten--

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:34.210
let me write it this way-- and
then this is also, it's 1 ten

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:35.035
and then 1 one.

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:41.120
So it's 1 ten plus 1 one.

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.490
I know this is kind of
strange to see it this way,

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:46.200
but it represents this
number of objects.

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.634
If we had a base 11, or I guess
we could say base 12 number

00:02:49.634 --> 00:02:51.300
system, maybe we would
have had a symbol

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:53.330
for this instead of
reusing our old digits.

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:56.009
Maybe a symbol could have
been something wacky.

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:57.550
Maybe it would've
been a smiley face.

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:58.970
Who knows what it
would have been?

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:01.390
And I'll introduce
higher number base

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:04.300
systems in kind of future
videos, where we see what,

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:06.962
kind of, the symbols
that are actually used.

00:03:06.962 --> 00:03:08.420
But what I want to
do in this video

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:10.460
is think about,
how would we count,

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:14.190
or what symbols would we
use, if we had fewer digits?

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:17.190
And in particular, how
would we count things

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.020
if we only had two digits?

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:21.654
If we only had 0 and 1.

00:03:21.654 --> 00:03:23.570
And that's essentially
what we're going to do,

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:27.620
is think about how we would
represent numbers in base 2.

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:31.060
Our traditional number system
is a base 10 number system.

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:34.040
We have 10 digits, 0 through 9.

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:36.560
How would we count in base 2?

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.970
So if you have zero things,
you'd still probably say,

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:41.910
hey, I have zero, I
can use the digit 0.

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:43.780
If I have one thing,
I could still say,

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:47.061
hey, I have one thing, because
we have the digits 0 and 1.

00:03:47.061 --> 00:03:48.060
So let me make it clear.

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:55.850
The digits here, the digits
in base 2 can be 0 or 1.

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:59.300
So if I have one thing, I
can still use the number 1.

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:02.030
But now all of a sudden, I
have these two objects here,

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:06.890
and I'm saying that I'm limited
to only these two digits

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:07.520
over here.

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:09.220
So how could I represent it?

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:11.270
Well, instead of
having a tens place,

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:13.440
I could create a twos place.

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:15.980
And I know it might sound a
little bit counterintuitive,

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:17.938
but I think you'll get
used to it a little bit.

00:04:17.938 --> 00:04:23.180
So over here in base 10, we
said we had 1 ten and 0 ones.

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:30.450
So in base 2, why can't we say
that we have 1 two and 0 ones?

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:32.200
Let me make that clear.

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:40.434
So this right here is
saying 1 two and 0 ones.

00:04:40.434 --> 00:04:42.600
I want to make sure you
understand the analogy here.

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:45.430
In base 10-- let me write
a larger number in base 10.

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:49.960
So if I write the
number 256 in base 10.

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:53.350
So this is base 10 over here.

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:54.290
What is this saying?

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:59.850
This is saying 2 hundreds,
so 2 times 100-- or maybe

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:01.510
I should write down
the word, because I

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:06.850
don't want to confuse the
symbols-- 2 hundreds plus 5

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:09.440
times, or maybe I
should say, 2 hundreds

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:19.902
plus 5 tens plus 6 ones.

00:05:19.902 --> 00:05:21.110
That's what I represent here.

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:22.610
And the way we know
that, is that we

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:24.780
know that if we go two
places to the left,

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:28.580
this is the hundreds place.

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:30.490
This is the tens place.

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:31.930
And this is the ones place.

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:33.520
And if you know
from your exponents,

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:36.330
this is equal to 10 times 10.

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:40.260
This right here is equal to
10 times itself only once.

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.370
And this is equal
to 10 times itself,

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:44.400
I guess you could
call it, zero times.

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:48.090
Or if you know your exponents,
this is 10 to the second power.

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:50.330
This is 10 to the
first power place.

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:52.080
And this is 10 to
the 0-th power place.

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:53.323
And if you added
another digit here,

00:05:53.323 --> 00:05:54.739
that would be the
thousands place,

00:05:54.739 --> 00:05:56.780
which would be 10
times 10 times 10.

00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:59.070
We're going to do the
exact same thing in base 2,

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:01.750
but instead of using 10,
we're going to use 2.

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:03.770
So now this is the twos place.

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:05.540
This is the twos
place over here.

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:07.070
This is the ones place.

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:09.640
If we add more digits
let me make it clear.

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:13.840
So in base 2, let me write
a number here in base 2.

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:17.560
And remember, in base 2 I
can only use zeroes and ones.

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:23.235
So in base 2 maybe I
have the number 1010.

00:06:23.235 --> 00:06:25.610
So when you think about it
this way, if this was base 10,

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:28.070
you would call this the tens
place, the hundreds place,

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:29.240
and the thousands place.

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:31.020
But this is base 2 now.

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:32.730
So let me be very clear.

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:34.540
We are only using two digits.

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:38.760
So in base 2, this right here,
this is still the ones place.

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:41.040
Now this is going to
be the twos place.

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:43.060
Remember in base 10
this was the tens place.

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:45.170
Now this is the twos place.

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:47.980
Now this would be, and you
could take a guess here,

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:49.930
hundreds was 10 times 10.

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:53.470
When we go two spaces
to the left in base 2,

00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:55.770
this should be the
2 times twos place,

00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:57.335
or this is the fours place.

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:04.230
This over here is going
to be the eights place.

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:05.770
So if you wanted
to kind of think

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:14.660
about this in terms of base 2,
this is 1 eight plus 0 fours

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:19.810
plus 1 twos plus 0 ones.

00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:26.680
So if you wanted to represent
this exact same number in base

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:30.360
10, it's 1 eight plus 1 two.

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:33.420
So in base 10 this would
be-- let me write it

00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:35.960
over here-- in
base 10, this would

00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:39.970
be an 8 plus a 2,
which is just a 10.

00:07:39.970 --> 00:07:42.581
So this is it in base 10.

00:07:42.581 --> 00:07:44.080
This is how you
would represent what

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:47.580
we know as this many
things, as 10 things,

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:49.920
this is how you would
represent it in base 2,

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:53.700
this is how we know we would
represent it in base 10.

00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:56.760
Now let's continue here, just to
make sure we understand things.

00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:58.540
So, this many objects.

00:07:58.540 --> 00:08:02.130
Well, in base 2, we
have 1 if you just

00:08:02.130 --> 00:08:05.330
have two objects,
that's 1 two and 0 ones.

00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:08.870
Now, three objects would
be one 2 plus 1 ones.

00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:09.990
So let me do it over here.

00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:12.990
So this would be
1 two plus 1 one.

00:08:12.990 --> 00:08:18.670
So this is three
objects in base 2.

00:08:18.670 --> 00:08:20.120
Now when you go to this.

00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:25.870
So over here we have 1
four, 0 twos, and 0 ones.

00:08:25.870 --> 00:08:28.082
So now we're going to
go to the four place,

00:08:28.082 --> 00:08:30.040
because we've essentially
maxed out everything.

00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:32.375
If we increment more, we
have to go to one more place.

00:08:32.375 --> 00:08:34.000
Just like we did in
base 10, but now we

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.730
could only use the
digits 0 and 1.

00:08:36.730 --> 00:08:41.650
So now we'll have 1
four, 0 twos, 0 ones.

00:08:41.650 --> 00:08:43.141
Now when we add one more.

00:08:43.141 --> 00:08:44.390
We're going to add one more 1.

00:08:44.390 --> 00:08:50.150
So now we have 1 four,
0 twos, and 1 one.

00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:53.540
And just to be clear,
this is this many things.

00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:56.010
This is this many
things in base 2,

00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:59.240
this is the four place,
1 four and 1 one.

00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:01.370
If you wanted to convert
this into base 10,

00:09:01.370 --> 00:09:08.690
you'd say, look, this is
1 four, 0 twos, and 1 one.

00:09:08.690 --> 00:09:10.910
So if you have a
four and a one, we

00:09:10.910 --> 00:09:14.050
would represent that with
the symbol 5 in base 10.

00:09:14.050 --> 00:09:16.930
We don't have that symbol
available to us in base 2.

00:09:16.930 --> 00:09:18.100
Let's go to this.

00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:19.990
So now we're going to
increment one more.

00:09:19.990 --> 00:09:21.656
So, how can we represent
that in base 2?

00:09:21.656 --> 00:09:23.770
This is definitely, we're
going to have 1 four.

00:09:23.770 --> 00:09:26.960
And then we're
going to have 1 two.

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:29.590
And then we're going
to have 0 ones.

00:09:29.590 --> 00:09:31.230
And if you keep--
it's kind of fun

00:09:31.230 --> 00:09:32.680
to practice counting in base 2.

00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:34.350
You'll start to
get the hang of it.

00:09:34.350 --> 00:09:38.699
So here we have to add 1 one
to this, so we get 1, 1, 1.

00:09:38.699 --> 00:09:40.240
And now when we get
to eight, there's

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:42.020
no way to kind of
increment any of these

00:09:42.020 --> 00:09:44.110
any higher, so we have
to get a new place.

00:09:44.110 --> 00:09:45.650
We have to go to
the eights place.

00:09:45.650 --> 00:09:50.710
So we have 1 eight, 0
fours, 0 twos, and 0 ones.

00:09:50.710 --> 00:09:53.000
This right here, it might
look like 1,000 to you,

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.930
but it would be 1,000
if we were in base 10.

00:09:55.930 --> 00:09:59.310
In base 2 this is
this many objects.

00:09:59.310 --> 00:10:02.350
This is eight objects in base 2.

00:10:02.350 --> 00:10:05.100
When you increment it
one, we'll have this many,

00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:07.000
we'll have 1 eight and
then we'll have 1 one.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.660
So it would be 1001.

00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:15.210
And then I'll stop here at what
we consider to be 10 objects.

00:10:15.210 --> 00:10:19.490
In base 10 you would
say you have 1 eight,

00:10:19.490 --> 00:10:24.140
and you would need 1 two, so
0 fours, 1 two, and 0 ones.

00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:28.090
So this right here
is 10 in base 2.

00:10:28.090 --> 00:10:30.480
This is 10 in base 10.

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:33.330
Hopefully, that doesn't
confuse you too much.
