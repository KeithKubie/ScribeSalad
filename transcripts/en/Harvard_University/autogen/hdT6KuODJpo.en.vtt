have in children where you you go in and
 

00:27:33.930 --> 00:27:35.900
have in children where you you go in and
then you follow it down and then you

00:27:35.900 --> 00:27:35.910
then you follow it down and then you
 

00:27:35.910 --> 00:27:38.000
then you follow it down and then you
come to a dead end and you got to work

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:38.010
come to a dead end and you got to work
 

00:27:38.010 --> 00:27:39.380
come to a dead end and you got to work
your way back and go down another

another little path I think there's a
 

00:27:42.030 --> 00:27:44.600
another little path I think there's a
lot of that and so you've got to be

00:27:44.600 --> 00:27:44.610
lot of that and so you've got to be
 

00:27:44.610 --> 00:27:47.210
lot of that and so you've got to be
willing to when you get to the dead end

00:27:47.210 --> 00:27:47.220
willing to when you get to the dead end
 

00:27:47.220 --> 00:27:49.790

your history with this issue well so I'd

00:31:07.530 --> 00:31:07.540
your history with this issue well so I'd
 

00:31:07.540 --> 00:31:09.030
your history with this issue well so I'd
been working on economic growth and

and so but then I turned to thinking
 

00:31:32.500 --> 00:31:34.080
and so but then I turned to thinking
about other issues and with respect to

constraints on growth you mentioned
earlier and what were the different

00:31:40.620 --> 00:31:40.630
earlier and what were the different
 

00:31:40.630 --> 00:31:42.090
earlier and what were the different
constraints and look

00:31:42.090 --> 00:31:42.100
constraints and look

at that time and the physical science I
 

00:31:57.370 --> 00:32:00.480
at that time and the physical science I
should say and the social science so the

that can be a real source I would like

00:37:57.190 --> 00:37:57.200
that can be a real source I would like
 

00:37:57.200 --> 00:37:59.710
that can be a real source I would like
to see solar and wind that have become

dirty energy that we've used don't have

dirty energy that we've used don't have
 

00:38:08.809 --> 00:38:11.559
dirty energy that we've used don't have
to use fossil fuel energy but can can

00:38:11.559 --> 00:38:11.569
to use fossil fuel energy but can can
 

00:38:11.569 --> 00:38:13.390
to use fossil fuel energy but can can
move in that direction so I'd love to

00:38:13.390 --> 00:38:13.400
move in that direction so I'd love to
 

00:38:13.400 --> 00:38:15.640
move in that direction so I'd love to
hear whether you feel that there's

yeah well I think I think it can be part

00:38:28.930 --> 00:38:28.940
yeah well I think I think it can be part
 

00:38:28.940 --> 00:38:33.070
yeah well I think I think it can be part
of it but my own sense is that given the

any experiments and we have analog

any experiments and we have analog
 

00:42:22.370 --> 00:42:24.220
any experiments and we have analog
experiments but we've actually never

so I think there's a tremendous amount

00:42:27.910 --> 00:42:27.920
so I think there's a tremendous amount
 

00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:30.600
so I think there's a tremendous amount
of uncertainty but I think as best guess

00:42:30.600 --> 00:42:30.610
of uncertainty but I think as best guess
 

00:42:30.610 --> 00:42:32.560
of uncertainty but I think as best guess
everybody's best guess is we did a

00:42:32.560 --> 00:42:32.570
everybody's best guess is we did a
 

00:42:32.570 --> 00:42:35.620
everybody's best guess is we did a
pretty high price to do it and do either

00:42:35.620 --> 00:42:35.630
pretty high price to do it and do either
 

00:42:35.630 --> 00:42:36.910

pathway to stay below what what the
 

00:45:14.630 --> 00:45:16.270
pathway to stay below what what the
governments of the world have said is a

00:45:16.270 --> 00:45:16.280
governments of the world have said is a
 

00:45:16.280 --> 00:45:18.940
governments of the world have said is a
safe limit which is to stay below two

00:45:18.940 --> 00:45:18.950
safe limit which is to stay below two
 

00:45:18.950 --> 00:45:21.640

pre-industrial standards and the world
 

00:45:23.840 --> 00:45:27.490
pre-industrial standards and the world
has agreed that scientists worry that it

may not be there may actually be a
 

00:45:32.480 --> 00:45:35.830
may not be there may actually be a
worrying standard that in fact at two

00:45:35.830 --> 00:45:35.840
worrying standard that in fact at two
 

00:45:35.840 --> 00:45:37.360
worrying standard that in fact at two
degrees the world could be very

00:45:37.360 --> 00:45:37.370
degrees the world could be very
 

00:45:37.370 --> 00:45:39.580
degrees the world could be very
disrupted by climate so we should be

00:45:39.580 --> 00:45:39.590
disrupted by climate so we should be
 

00:45:39.590 --> 00:45:41.440
disrupted by climate so we should be
trying to stay below two degrees and

00:45:41.440 --> 00:45:41.450
trying to stay below two degrees and
 

00:45:41.450 --> 00:45:43.840
trying to stay below two degrees and
certainly small island states would go

00:45:43.840 --> 00:45:43.850
certainly small island states would go
 

00:45:43.850 --> 00:45:46.540
certainly small island states would go
under if we go up to two degrees so we

00:45:46.540 --> 00:45:46.550
under if we go up to two degrees so we
 

00:45:46.550 --> 00:45:48.220
under if we go up to two degrees so we
should stay below the two degrees what

00:45:48.220 --> 00:45:48.230
should stay below the two degrees what
 

00:45:48.230 --> 00:45:49.570

be that climate agreement where

hopefully 194 countries will agree to a

hopefully 194 countries will agree to a
 

00:45:59.240 --> 00:46:01.840
hopefully 194 countries will agree to a
pathway to keep us below two degrees it

00:46:01.840 --> 00:46:01.850
pathway to keep us below two degrees it
 

00:46:01.850 --> 00:46:03.340
pathway to keep us below two degrees it
would probably quite a short agreement

00:46:03.340 --> 00:46:03.350
would probably quite a short agreement
 

00:46:03.350 --> 00:46:06.070
would probably quite a short agreement
it's a very important one the next

00:46:06.070 --> 00:46:06.080
it's a very important one the next
 

00:46:06.080 --> 00:46:09.400
it's a very important one the next
pillar is that every country has agreed

00:46:09.400 --> 00:46:09.410

00:50:18.320 --> 00:50:23.050
implementation I mean the u.s. is not
close to meeting any ambitious goals so

00:50:23.050 --> 00:50:23.060
close to meeting any ambitious goals so
 

00:50:23.060 --> 00:50:29.200
close to meeting any ambitious goals so
I I think again I I would like to think

00:50:29.200 --> 00:50:29.210
I I think again I I would like to think
 

00:50:29.210 --> 00:50:31.839
I I think again I I would like to think
it I would hope it but I think

00:50:31.839 --> 00:50:31.849
it I would hope it but I think
 

00:50:31.849 --> 00:50:34.750
it I would hope it but I think
economists aren't paid to hope they were

00:50:34.750 --> 00:50:34.760
economists aren't paid to hope they were
 

00:50:34.760 --> 00:50:39.550
economists aren't paid to hope they were
paid to calculate and to look at look at

00:50:39.550 --> 00:50:39.560
paid to calculate and to look at look at
 

00:50:39.560 --> 00:50:43.829
paid to calculate and to look at look at
not what people say but what they do and

00:50:43.829 --> 00:50:43.839
not what people say but what they do and
 

00:50:43.839 --> 00:50:47.109
not what people say but what they do and
outside of Europe basically no one is

00:50:47.109 --> 00:50:47.119
outside of Europe basically no one is
 

00:50:47.119 --> 00:50:49.770
outside of Europe basically no one is
doing anything and within Europe

00:50:49.770 --> 00:50:49.780
doing anything and within Europe
 

00:50:49.780 --> 00:50:52.329
doing anything and within Europe
European trading system is basically

00:50:52.329 --> 00:50:52.339
European trading system is basically
 

00:50:52.339 --> 00:50:55.569
European trading system is basically
falling apart because of another set of

00:50:55.569 --> 00:50:55.579
falling apart because of another set of
 

00:50:55.579 --> 00:50:58.690
falling apart because of another set of
issues so I I would I would like to be

00:50:58.690 --> 00:50:58.700
issues so I I would I would like to be
 

00:50:58.700 --> 00:51:00.220
issues so I I would I would like to be
able to agree with you that we're doing

00:51:00.220 --> 00:51:00.230
able to agree with you that we're doing
 

00:51:00.230 --> 00:51:02.319
able to agree with you that we're doing
something but I think unless we get to

00:51:02.319 --> 00:51:02.329
something but I think unless we get to
 

00:51:02.329 --> 00:51:05.859
something but I think unless we get to
the point where we have an agreement

00:51:05.859 --> 00:51:05.869
the point where we have an agreement
 

00:51:05.869 --> 00:51:08.020
the point where we have an agreement
that where there's some incentives for

00:51:08.020 --> 00:51:08.030
that where there's some incentives for
 

00:51:08.030 --> 00:51:10.359
that where there's some incentives for
countries to actually implement their

00:51:10.359 --> 00:51:10.369
countries to actually implement their
 

00:51:10.369 --> 00:51:13.300
countries to actually implement their
programs we're not going to I would come

00:51:13.300 --> 00:51:13.310
programs we're not going to I would come
 

00:51:13.310 --> 00:51:15.220
programs we're not going to I would come
back to your but I want to come back to

00:51:15.220 --> 00:51:15.230
back to your but I want to come back to
 

00:51:15.230 --> 00:51:21.579
back to your but I want to come back to
1945 which I remember a little bit as a

00:51:21.579 --> 00:51:21.589
1945 which I remember a little bit as a
 

00:51:21.589 --> 00:51:23.800
1945 which I remember a little bit as a
little I was just out of diapers but I

00:51:23.800 --> 00:51:23.810
little I was just out of diapers but I
 

00:51:23.810 --> 00:51:27.280
little I was just out of diapers but I
do remember there was so if you look at

00:51:27.280 --> 00:51:27.290
do remember there was so if you look at
 

00:51:27.290 --> 00:51:29.770
do remember there was so if you look at
the Bretton I want to go back to the

00:51:29.770 --> 00:51:29.780
the Bretton I want to go back to the
 

00:51:29.780 --> 00:51:31.510
the Bretton I want to go back to the
Bretton Woods agreements which were very

00:51:31.510 --> 00:51:31.520
Bretton Woods agreements which were very
 

00:51:31.520 --> 00:51:34.310
Bretton Woods agreements which were very
interesting agreements and

00:51:34.310 --> 00:51:34.320
interesting agreements and
 

00:51:34.320 --> 00:51:36.720
interesting agreements and
you know the Bretton Woods exchange rate

00:51:36.720 --> 00:51:36.730
you know the Bretton Woods exchange rate
 

00:51:36.730 --> 00:51:39.090
you know the Bretton Woods exchange rate
agreement lasted until 1971 so that's

00:51:39.090 --> 00:51:39.100
agreement lasted until 1971 so that's
 

00:51:39.100 --> 00:51:41.130
agreement lasted until 1971 so that's
that's pretty good the the actual

00:51:41.130 --> 00:51:41.140
that's pretty good the the actual
 

00:51:41.140 --> 00:51:42.840
that's pretty good the the actual
institutions have survived to this day

00:51:42.840 --> 00:51:42.850
institutions have survived to this day
 

00:51:42.850 --> 00:51:45.360
institutions have survived to this day
although the WTO was quite different

00:51:45.360 --> 00:51:45.370
although the WTO was quite different
 

00:51:45.370 --> 00:51:48.480
although the WTO was quite different
from what the original design was but

00:51:48.480 --> 00:51:48.490
from what the original design was but
 

00:51:48.490 --> 00:51:50.540
from what the original design was but
they had a completely different design

00:51:50.540 --> 00:51:50.550
they had a completely different design
 

00:51:50.550 --> 00:51:54.390
they had a completely different design
from a point of view of treaty design

00:51:54.390 --> 00:51:54.400
from a point of view of treaty design
 

00:51:54.400 --> 00:51:58.110
from a point of view of treaty design
and that was they were had a small

00:51:58.110 --> 00:51:58.120
and that was they were had a small
 

00:51:58.120 --> 00:52:00.540
and that was they were had a small
number of countries like to the United

00:52:00.540 --> 00:52:00.550
number of countries like to the United
 

00:52:00.550 --> 00:52:02.670
number of countries like to the United
States and Britain designing

00:52:02.670 --> 00:52:02.680
States and Britain designing
 

00:52:02.680 --> 00:52:04.950
States and Britain designing
institutions and they were designing

00:52:04.950 --> 00:52:04.960
institutions and they were designing
 

00:52:04.960 --> 00:52:08.700
institutions and they were designing
institutions that they thought countries

00:52:08.700 --> 00:52:08.710
institutions that they thought countries
 

00:52:08.710 --> 00:52:11.820
institutions that they thought countries
would won't eventually want to join and

00:52:11.820 --> 00:52:11.830
would won't eventually want to join and
 

00:52:11.830 --> 00:52:15.270
would won't eventually want to join and
when they would join would improve the

00:52:15.270 --> 00:52:15.280
when they would join would improve the
 

00:52:15.280 --> 00:52:16.950
when they would join would improve the
either the finance in the case of the

00:52:16.950 --> 00:52:16.960
either the finance in the case of the
 

00:52:16.960 --> 00:52:20.160
either the finance in the case of the
IMF or or trade in the case of what is

00:52:20.160 --> 00:52:20.170
IMF or or trade in the case of what is
 

00:52:20.170 --> 00:52:22.140
IMF or or trade in the case of what is
now the WTO so it's a completely

00:52:22.140 --> 00:52:22.150
now the WTO so it's a completely
 

00:52:22.150 --> 00:52:23.850
now the WTO so it's a completely
different design from this bottom up

00:52:23.850 --> 00:52:23.860
different design from this bottom up
 

00:52:23.860 --> 00:52:25.890
different design from this bottom up
what I call the bottom up treaties that

00:52:25.890 --> 00:52:25.900
what I call the bottom up treaties that
 

00:52:25.900 --> 00:52:30.200
what I call the bottom up treaties that
are the treaties of IPCC of the of the

00:52:30.200 --> 00:52:30.210
are the treaties of IPCC of the of the
 

00:52:30.210 --> 00:52:33.300
are the treaties of IPCC of the of the
IPCC and the organisations associated

00:52:33.300 --> 00:52:33.310
IPCC and the organisations associated
 

00:52:33.310 --> 00:52:36.510
IPCC and the organisations associated
with that so my own thought is what you

00:52:36.510 --> 00:52:36.520
with that so my own thought is what you
 

00:52:36.520 --> 00:52:37.920
with that so my own thought is what you
need is something actually quite like

00:52:37.920 --> 00:52:37.930
need is something actually quite like
 

00:52:37.930 --> 00:52:41.160
need is something actually quite like
the Bretton Woods treaties where you get

00:52:41.160 --> 00:52:41.170
the Bretton Woods treaties where you get
 

00:52:41.170 --> 00:52:42.750
the Bretton Woods treaties where you get
a small number of countries to think

00:52:42.750 --> 00:52:42.760
a small number of countries to think
 

00:52:42.760 --> 00:52:45.810
a small number of countries to think
what kind of treaty would be one that

00:52:45.810 --> 00:52:45.820
what kind of treaty would be one that
 

00:52:45.820 --> 00:52:48.300
what kind of treaty would be one that
not only would be when people would want

00:52:48.300 --> 00:52:48.310
not only would be when people would want
 

00:52:48.310 --> 00:52:49.980
not only would be when people would want
to join the way they want now to join

00:52:49.980 --> 00:52:49.990
to join the way they want now to join
 

00:52:49.990 --> 00:52:52.980
to join the way they want now to join
the WTO but would also be ones that

00:52:52.980 --> 00:52:52.990
the WTO but would also be ones that
 

00:52:52.990 --> 00:52:55.470
the WTO but would also be ones that
would eventually as they began to

00:52:55.470 --> 00:52:55.480
would eventually as they began to
 

00:52:55.480 --> 00:53:00.000
would eventually as they began to
tighten be able to attain maybe not a

00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:00.010
tighten be able to attain maybe not a
 

00:53:00.010 --> 00:53:02.790
tighten be able to attain maybe not a
two degree to go but something better

00:53:02.790 --> 00:53:02.800
two degree to go but something better
 

00:53:02.800 --> 00:53:07.110
two degree to go but something better
than the trajectory that were on now and

00:53:07.110 --> 00:53:07.120
than the trajectory that were on now and
 

00:53:07.120 --> 00:53:09.030
than the trajectory that were on now and
I think until we get to the point where

00:53:09.030 --> 00:53:09.040
I think until we get to the point where
 

00:53:09.040 --> 00:53:11.250
I think until we get to the point where
we're thinking of treaty design with

00:53:11.250 --> 00:53:11.260
we're thinking of treaty design with
 

00:53:11.260 --> 00:53:14.190
we're thinking of treaty design with
incentives for countries to join into

00:53:14.190 --> 00:53:14.200
incentives for countries to join into
 

00:53:14.200 --> 00:53:18.930
incentives for countries to join into
something that has costly domestic steps

00:53:18.930 --> 00:53:18.940
something that has costly domestic steps
 

00:53:18.940 --> 00:53:21.930
something that has costly domestic steps
to actually it's gonna be slightly

00:53:21.930 --> 00:53:21.940
to actually it's gonna be slightly
 

00:53:21.940 --> 00:53:23.610
to actually it's gonna be slightly
painful for countries to take these

00:53:23.610 --> 00:53:23.620
painful for countries to take these
 

00:53:23.620 --> 00:53:25.470
painful for countries to take these
steps and they're gonna have to take it

00:53:25.470 --> 00:53:25.480
steps and they're gonna have to take it
 

00:53:25.480 --> 00:53:27.120
steps and they're gonna have to take it
not because they want to take it for

00:53:27.120 --> 00:53:27.130
not because they want to take it for
 

00:53:27.130 --> 00:53:29.010
not because they want to take it for
their own national economic interests

00:53:29.010 --> 00:53:29.020
their own national economic interests
 

00:53:29.020 --> 00:53:31.410
their own national economic interests
but because part of it and not because

00:53:31.410 --> 00:53:31.420
but because part of it and not because
 

00:53:31.420 --> 00:53:34.290
but because part of it and not because
they're altruistic because companies

00:53:34.290 --> 00:53:34.300
they're altruistic because companies
 

00:53:34.300 --> 00:53:37.740
they're altruistic because companies
have limited altruism I live in a regard

00:53:37.740 --> 00:53:37.750
have limited altruism I live in a regard
 

00:53:37.750 --> 00:53:39.780
have limited altruism I live in a regard
for other countries welfare but because

00:53:39.780 --> 00:53:39.790
for other countries welfare but because
 

00:53:39.790 --> 00:53:42.690
for other countries welfare but because
as in the case of the WTO it's part of

00:53:42.690 --> 00:53:42.700
as in the case of the WTO it's part of
 

00:53:42.700 --> 00:53:44.670
as in the case of the WTO it's part of
the rules of the game in the WTO the

00:53:44.670 --> 00:53:44.680
the rules of the game in the WTO the
 

00:53:44.680 --> 00:53:46.120
the rules of the game in the WTO the
rules of the game are you

00:53:46.120 --> 00:53:46.130
rules of the game are you
 

00:53:46.130 --> 00:53:48.069
rules of the game are you
have to keep your tariffs low and if you

00:53:48.069 --> 00:53:48.079
have to keep your tariffs low and if you
 

00:53:48.079 --> 00:53:50.019
have to keep your tariffs low and if you
don't you'll have other countries put

00:53:50.019 --> 00:53:50.029
don't you'll have other countries put
 

00:53:50.029 --> 00:53:51.759
don't you'll have other countries put
tariffs on you so it has to be the rules

00:53:51.759 --> 00:53:51.769
tariffs on you so it has to be the rules
 

00:53:51.769 --> 00:53:53.710
tariffs on you so it has to be the rules
of the game that you have to do steep

00:53:53.710 --> 00:53:53.720
of the game that you have to do steep
 

00:53:53.720 --> 00:53:55.599
of the game that you have to do steep
emissions reductions and if you don't

00:53:55.599 --> 00:53:55.609
emissions reductions and if you don't
 

00:53:55.609 --> 00:53:57.670
emissions reductions and if you don't
there will be consequences the problem

00:53:57.670 --> 00:53:57.680
there will be consequences the problem
 

00:53:57.680 --> 00:53:59.680
there will be consequences the problem
with the current design is that we've

00:53:59.680 --> 00:53:59.690
with the current design is that we've
 

00:53:59.690 --> 00:54:01.900
with the current design is that we've
had such secure is there no consequences

00:54:01.900 --> 00:54:01.910
had such secure is there no consequences
 

00:54:01.910 --> 00:54:04.150
had such secure is there no consequences
if countries just go about their

00:54:04.150 --> 00:54:04.160
if countries just go about their
 

00:54:04.160 --> 00:54:06.370
if countries just go about their
business and do whatever they want so I

00:54:06.370 --> 00:54:06.380
business and do whatever they want so I
 

00:54:06.380 --> 00:54:09.130
business and do whatever they want so I
think that that's where I see a missing

00:54:09.130 --> 00:54:09.140
think that that's where I see a missing
 

00:54:09.140 --> 00:54:12.130
think that that's where I see a missing
ingredient in the pillars maybe the

00:54:12.130 --> 00:54:12.140
ingredient in the pillars maybe the
 

00:54:12.140 --> 00:54:14.289
ingredient in the pillars maybe the
French maybe it's asymmetric and not

00:54:14.289 --> 00:54:14.299
French maybe it's asymmetric and not
 

00:54:14.299 --> 00:54:17.019
French maybe it's asymmetric and not
French tat five pillars but you need a

00:54:17.019 --> 00:54:17.029
French tat five pillars but you need a
 

00:54:17.029 --> 00:54:19.569
French tat five pillars but you need a
fifth pillar in that which is something

00:54:19.569 --> 00:54:19.579
fifth pillar in that which is something
 

00:54:19.579 --> 00:54:22.839
fifth pillar in that which is something
that harnesses countries self-interest

00:54:22.839 --> 00:54:22.849
that harnesses countries self-interest
 

00:54:22.849 --> 00:54:26.410
that harnesses countries self-interest
to deep and steep emissions reductions

be erroneous but I was curious what kind
