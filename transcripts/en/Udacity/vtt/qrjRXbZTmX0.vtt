00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
The answer is "yes." At least we hope it's hard to compute d.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Otherwise, RSA would be insecure.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
This, of course, is only true if n is big enough and n is a product of two primes.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.000
The reason the no answer doesn't work is because actually doing the computation

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
of the totient is difficult.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.000
If we don't know how to turn n into a factor of primes, then it's hard to compute this.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
We finished showing the correctness property for RSA.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Now we're getting to the question of how can we claim RSA is secure.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
This claim that it is secure because otherwise it would be insecure

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
is not a very convincing proof.

00:00:38.000 --> 99:59:59.000
That's what we're going to look at next.
