- Hey, you've never used
that memory changing thing

00:00:04.771 --> 00:00:06.006
on me, have you?

00:00:06.006 --> 00:00:08.141
- No, why are you asking?

00:00:08.141 --> 00:00:09.142
- Okay good.

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:11.911
Bird seed!

00:00:11.911 --> 00:00:13.446
What the hell is
this doing here?

00:00:13.446 --> 00:00:14.814
- I--

00:00:14.814 --> 00:00:15.882
- You know, that's funny.

00:00:15.882 --> 00:00:16.816
I've always loved birds.

00:00:16.816 --> 00:00:17.884
I mean, maybe this is a sign.

00:00:17.884 --> 00:00:18.718
Maybe I should get one.

00:00:18.718 --> 00:00:19.586
What do you think?

00:00:19.586 --> 00:00:20.453
- No, no, no, no.

00:00:20.453 --> 00:00:21.554
Definitely not, okay?

00:00:21.554 --> 00:00:22.489
I hate birds.

00:00:22.489 --> 00:00:23.923
They smell, they squawk,

00:00:23.923 --> 00:00:25.558 align:start size:94% position:6%
and once you get one
you're gonna get attached,

00:00:25.558 --> 00:00:26.626 align:start size:84% position:16%
you're not gonna want
to get rid of it.

00:00:26.626 --> 00:00:27.827
I think it's a bad idea.

00:00:27.827 --> 00:00:29.262
- Okay, fine, geeze.

00:00:29.262 --> 00:00:31.231
I won't get a bird.

00:00:31.231 --> 00:00:32.232
What?

00:00:32.232 --> 00:00:33.299
That's weird.

00:00:33.299 --> 00:00:34.801
I just got a comment on a video

00:00:34.801 --> 00:00:37.470
I don't even remember posting.

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:39.439
Can you say I love you?

00:00:39.439 --> 00:00:40.940
- I love you Jeff.

00:00:42.442 --> 00:00:44.511
Look, look, he's dancing!

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.684 align:start size:84% position:16%
(laughing) It
tickles, it tickles.

00:00:51.684 --> 00:00:52.919
I had a pet bird?

00:00:52.919 --> 00:00:54.254
And you killed him, didn't you?

00:00:54.254 --> 00:00:55.255
Didn't you?

00:00:55.255 --> 00:00:58.558
(electric buzzing)

00:00:58.558 --> 00:01:00.460
Oh well anyways,
like I was saying,

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.496 align:start size:97% position:3%
thank you so much for making
me those pumpkin muffins.

00:01:03.496 --> 00:01:05.165
They were delicious.
