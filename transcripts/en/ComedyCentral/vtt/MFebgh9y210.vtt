00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:03.669
My opponent tonight is
a former Rhodes Scholar,

00:00:03.702 --> 00:00:05.371
the former mayor of Newark,

00:00:05.404 --> 00:00:07.573
and the current senator
from New Jersey,

00:00:07.606 --> 00:00:09.909
-Senator Cory Booker.
-It's good to see you.

00:00:09.942 --> 00:00:11.110
-Good to see you, Jordan.
-Good to see you.

00:00:11.143 --> 00:00:12.311
-Good to see you, too, Jordan.
-Welcome.

00:00:12.344 --> 00:00:13.546
First I'd like to thank you
for coming.

00:00:13.579 --> 00:00:14.947
I'd also like to thank Aiden

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:16.582
for letting us use
his room here.

00:00:16.615 --> 00:00:17.817
BOOKER:
This is a pretty great room.

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.085
KLEPPER:
I'm a big fan of trains.

00:00:19.118 --> 00:00:20.286
You know where you're going
with a train.

00:00:20.319 --> 00:00:21.821
Yes, yes.

00:00:21.854 --> 00:00:23.589
You got to stay on track in
life; it's a very good metaphor.

00:00:23.622 --> 00:00:24.791
-Exactly.
-Yes.

00:00:24.824 --> 00:00:26.759
-I want to stay on track, Cory.
-Yes.

00:00:26.792 --> 00:00:28.761
-We've got some kids here.
-Yes.

00:00:28.794 --> 00:00:30.463
There's a big march coming up.

00:00:30.496 --> 00:00:32.832
Can you just,
can you just tell them

00:00:32.865 --> 00:00:35.334
that this is a fad
and it's time to move on?

00:00:35.367 --> 00:00:36.836
What do you think
about this march?

00:00:36.869 --> 00:00:38.805 line:0%
Well, two things.
One is, you have to understand

00:00:38.838 --> 00:00:41.407 line:0%
that change has never in history
come<i> from</i> Washington.

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.009 line:0%
It's come<i> to</i> Washington.

00:00:43.042 --> 00:00:44.644 line:0%
Strom Thurmond
didn't just one day say,

00:00:44.677 --> 00:00:46.512 line:0%
"Hey, I think those black folks
should have some civil rights."

00:00:46.545 --> 00:00:49.148
No. It was people that marched
and demonstrated

00:00:49.181 --> 00:00:50.883
and brought change
to Washington.

00:00:50.916 --> 00:00:52.585
What they're doing is not only
consistent with history,

00:00:52.618 --> 00:00:54.120
it's actually been
the only pathway

00:00:54.153 --> 00:00:56.055
that real, meaningful change
has been made

00:00:56.088 --> 00:00:57.957
is through the activism
of young Americans.

00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:59.392
And so you're supporting
these kids.

00:00:59.425 --> 00:01:00.793
Have they,
have they bullied you?

00:01:00.826 --> 00:01:02.628
Is that what I'm seeing
right now?

00:01:02.661 --> 00:01:04.497
Are you gonna be
smoking some doobies

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.166
out by the park bench
with the cool kids?

00:01:07.199 --> 00:01:10.069
I think that what these guys
are doing is leading by example.

00:01:10.102 --> 00:01:12.538
They're letting adults know,

00:01:12.571 --> 00:01:14.173
you guys haven't been able
to make change.

00:01:14.206 --> 00:01:17.043 line:0%
We have a horrific reality
where every day in America

00:01:17.076 --> 00:01:19.145 line:0%
dozens of people are dying
due to gun violence.

00:01:19.178 --> 00:01:20.580 line:0%
And that this has to stop.

00:01:20.613 --> 00:01:21.948 line:0%
You guys haven't stopped it,

00:01:21.981 --> 00:01:24.150 line:0%
so we're gonna take the helm
and lead the change.

00:01:24.183 --> 00:01:25.518
Well, what-what's adults
problems?

00:01:25.551 --> 00:01:28.054
I mean, I know I'm fine.
I got what I want.

00:01:28.087 --> 00:01:30.923
Change not happening.
Status quo, thumbs up.

00:01:30.956 --> 00:01:32.825
But you're an adult, you're an
adult in a position of power.

00:01:32.858 --> 00:01:34.293
Why isn't change happening
from your end?

00:01:34.326 --> 00:01:35.795
Well, first of all,
it's very frustrating.

00:01:35.828 --> 00:01:37.763
I know what captures
a lot of attention

00:01:37.796 --> 00:01:41.367
is often the mass shootings,
these awful, awful realities,

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.469
but every day in America,

00:01:43.502 --> 00:01:46.139
we have lots of shootings
in communities like mine.

00:01:46.172 --> 00:01:49.609
I've had two shootings
on my block in the last year.

00:01:49.642 --> 00:01:52.745
Last-- most recently last week,
Shahad Smith was killed

00:01:52.778 --> 00:01:56.249
by an automatic weapon at the
top of the block where I live.

00:01:56.282 --> 00:01:58.751
I live in an inner city,
low-income community.

00:01:58.784 --> 00:02:00.753
And so this is hurtful

00:02:00.786 --> 00:02:02.688
that we have not been able
to make change.

00:02:02.721 --> 00:02:04.757
And a lot of the times
the people in power

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:08.094
often don't represent the views,
Republican or Democrat,

00:02:08.127 --> 00:02:10.062
of the majority
of their citizens.

00:02:10.095 --> 00:02:12.698
And so this is the time
where the people want change.

00:02:12.731 --> 00:02:16.269
They want common sense
gun safety measures to be done.

00:02:16.302 --> 00:02:18.638
But the people in power
aren't doing anything.

00:02:18.671 --> 00:02:20.773
And I think what these young
people are gonna show,

00:02:20.806 --> 00:02:22.441
what the truth
in any democracy is,

00:02:22.474 --> 00:02:23.910
that the power of the people

00:02:23.943 --> 00:02:25.378
is greater than the people
in power.

00:02:25.411 --> 00:02:27.580
You mentioned mass shootings.

00:02:27.613 --> 00:02:29.749
And this movement seems to be
a response to school shootings,

00:02:29.782 --> 00:02:31.717
but mass shootings
are only three percent

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.687
of the gun deaths
in America in 2017.

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.155
Is this a misguided movement?

00:02:36.188 --> 00:02:37.623
Are they focusing
on the wrong things?

00:02:37.656 --> 00:02:40.159 line:0%
No, in fact, I've heard
incredible eloquence

00:02:40.192 --> 00:02:42.562 line:0%
by a lot of the young people
around the country,

00:02:42.595 --> 00:02:45.431 line:0%
young people from Parkland,
even young people in New Jersey,

00:02:45.464 --> 00:02:47.533 line:0%
who've been saying, "Hey, look,
we're gonna use this moment

00:02:47.566 --> 00:02:50.102 line:0%
"to shine a light on the fact
that we have,

00:02:50.135 --> 00:02:51.871 line:0%
"in many poor communities
and communities of color,

00:02:51.904 --> 00:02:55.141 line:0%
"that deaths are happening
every day,

00:02:55.174 --> 00:02:56.976 line:0%
and for some reason nobody
is paying attention."

00:02:57.009 --> 00:02:58.344
Because again,
this is not a problem

00:02:58.377 --> 00:03:00.313
that we can't
do something about.

00:03:00.346 --> 00:03:02.215
We have the power
to make change.

00:03:02.248 --> 00:03:05.218
And so what this is
a question of not is "can we,"

00:03:05.251 --> 00:03:07.186
but "do we have
the collective will?"

00:03:07.219 --> 00:03:08.988
And I think what they're doing
is waking up

00:03:09.021 --> 00:03:10.623
the moral imagination
of this country,

00:03:10.656 --> 00:03:12.992
uh, pointing
to the moral urgency,

00:03:13.025 --> 00:03:14.794
and they're determined
to keep it going.

00:03:14.827 --> 00:03:17.196
Now, you're talking a lot
about people coming together.

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:18.331
-Yeah.
-This is what you do.

00:03:18.364 --> 00:03:19.532
You love to talk about that.

00:03:19.565 --> 00:03:21.400
Wayne LaPierre talked about you

00:03:21.433 --> 00:03:24.637
and your European socialism
when it comes to guns.

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:27.206
-Yes. -Do you just want
everybody to share one gun?

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:29.809
-Is that your ultimate vision
for America? -Um...

00:03:29.842 --> 00:03:32.178
you know, when our founders
came together

00:03:32.211 --> 00:03:34.447
and the end of
the Declaration of Independence

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.882
with these noble words that
if this country's gonna work,

00:03:36.915 --> 00:03:39.652
we must mutually pledge
to each other, you know,

00:03:39.685 --> 00:03:41.621
they said "our lives,
our fortunes,

00:03:41.654 --> 00:03:42.922
and our sacred honor."

00:03:42.955 --> 00:03:45.291
This is a country, yeah,
of rugged individualism,

00:03:45.324 --> 00:03:47.393
and it's a country
of self-reliance,

00:03:47.426 --> 00:03:49.862
but we also have proven
to humanity, you know,

00:03:49.895 --> 00:03:51.530
rugged individualism
didn't get us to the Moon.

00:03:51.563 --> 00:03:54.533
That when we come together
and work together and partner,

00:03:54.566 --> 00:03:56.769
we can do things
that are beyond the imagination

00:03:56.802 --> 00:03:58.671
-of our ancestors.
-(scoffs)

00:03:58.704 --> 00:04:00.673
You really think
we went to the Moon?

00:04:00.706 --> 00:04:03.009
(laughs)

00:04:03.042 --> 00:04:05.211
I hate to do this
because this is my show,

00:04:05.244 --> 00:04:06.512
but have I children here,

00:04:06.545 --> 00:04:08.648
and apparently
they have questions.

00:04:08.681 --> 00:04:11.183
So if you don't mind, there's
some questions they'd like...

00:04:11.216 --> 00:04:13.486
You're giving over
some of your, uh...

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:14.887
-your platform, right.
-You know, I'm a nice guy.

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:16.122
Just because I'm an adult
and I think

00:04:16.155 --> 00:04:17.757
we should talk down to children,

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:19.125
doesn't mean
I'm always going to talk down.

00:04:19.158 --> 00:04:20.393
I was wondering
about this positioning.

00:04:20.426 --> 00:04:21.794
You put them on the floor,

00:04:21.827 --> 00:04:24.130
-Look, I... -and you had us
lord above the young people.

00:04:24.163 --> 00:04:26.198
This is just functionally
the best position, all right?

00:04:26.231 --> 00:04:28.501
-Okay.
-Don't let the metaphor play out

00:04:28.534 --> 00:04:30.303
that I'm literally
talking down to children,

00:04:30.336 --> 00:04:32.405
-Make you think that that's
what I want. -Uh, all right.

00:04:32.438 --> 00:04:34.073
All right, well, even though
they're lower than us,

00:04:34.106 --> 00:04:36.642
let's look up to them
and-and their stature.

00:04:36.675 --> 00:04:37.810
So come on.

00:04:37.843 --> 00:04:39.745
Mr. Booker, thank you
for talking to me today.

00:04:39.778 --> 00:04:42.148
The Democratic party
has helped my movement

00:04:42.181 --> 00:04:43.349
by giving us a platform,

00:04:43.382 --> 00:04:44.850
and we've been speaking a lot
about change.

00:04:44.883 --> 00:04:46.919
When will you actually propose
any change?

00:04:46.952 --> 00:04:48.821
Right. Well, I'm hopeful
that this is gonna...

00:04:48.854 --> 00:04:51.657
this election in November
is gonna be a referendum.

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:53.559
And I... I don't want it to be
a partisan election.

00:04:53.592 --> 00:04:55.995
This is a...
simply about left or right,

00:04:56.028 --> 00:04:57.196
or Republican or Democrat.

00:04:57.229 --> 00:04:58.864
To me,
it's about right or wrong.

00:04:58.897 --> 00:05:01.233
And if you are a person
standing up and blocking,

00:05:01.266 --> 00:05:02.501
if you're in Congress right now

00:05:02.534 --> 00:05:04.904
and you're blocking
what 90% of Americans want,

00:05:04.937 --> 00:05:06.172
some of these
common-sense things,

00:05:06.205 --> 00:05:08.074
then you need to be
voted out of office

00:05:08.107 --> 00:05:09.775
because you are being complicit.

00:05:09.808 --> 00:05:12.445
Our inaction is being complicit
in the continued violence.

00:05:12.478 --> 00:05:13.846
My favorite question:

00:05:13.879 --> 00:05:15.581
you've talked about a lot
of stuff I have no idea about,

00:05:15.614 --> 00:05:17.083
and it really didn't stick.

00:05:17.116 --> 00:05:19.518
So I'd like you to tell me
something I already know.

00:05:19.551 --> 00:05:21.287
Well, I think you know

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:24.924
that the long arc of history
bends towards justice.

00:05:24.957 --> 00:05:26.992
We are a country that's gotten
better and better and better,

00:05:27.025 --> 00:05:28.227
-and you know that.
-Is that where it goes?

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:29.795
It does. It absolutely does.

00:05:29.828 --> 00:05:31.163
But it doesn't bend
automatically.

00:05:31.196 --> 00:05:32.498
We've got to be the benders.

00:05:32.531 --> 00:05:34.367
And so the right side of history
right now

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:36.836
is finding the common ground
and doing those things

00:05:36.869 --> 00:05:39.605
that will make America safer.

00:05:39.638 --> 00:05:40.840
Yeah, I totally knew that.

00:05:40.873 --> 00:05:42.375
-(laughs): All right.
-Senator Cory Booker.
