he was being edited I mean it wasn't

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080
he was being edited I mean it wasn't
 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.510
he was being edited I mean it wasn't
like he was being educated by a bunch of

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520
like he was being educated by a bunch of
 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.580
like he was being educated by a bunch of

conventional economic education but at

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:38.970
conventional economic education but at
 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:41.360
conventional economic education but at
the same time I mean really as I tell it

of simultaneously and there was a lot of

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960
of simultaneously and there was a lot of
 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.920
of simultaneously and there was a lot of
cross-pollination at MIT in Chicago but

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930
cross-pollination at MIT in Chicago but
 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.170
cross-pollination at MIT in Chicago but
at MIT there was always this sense of

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180
at MIT there was always this sense of
 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.119
at MIT there was always this sense of
here's this great model for

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129
here's this great model for
 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:54.710
here's this great model for
understanding how the market works and

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:54.720
understanding how the market works and
 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:57.049
understanding how the market works and
also we totally agree that the market is

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059
also we totally agree that the market is
 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.000
also we totally agree that the market is
pretty hard to outsmart we don't know

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010
pretty hard to outsmart we don't know
 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.380
pretty hard to outsmart we don't know
that it's smart but it is hard for other

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390
that it's smart but it is hard for other
 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.509
that it's smart but it is hard for other
people to outsmart but we were not so

00:01:02.509 --> 00:01:02.519
people to outsmart but we were not so
 

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:04.579
people to outsmart but we were not so
sure that means that it's all working

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589
sure that means that it's all working
 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.100
sure that means that it's all working
perfectly whereas it Chicago it became

this project to sort of show how great

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840
this project to sort of show how great
 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.539
this project to sort of show how great
markets were and how much better they

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549
markets were and how much better they
 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.150
markets were and how much better they
were than any government bureaucrat so

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:14.160
were than any government bureaucrat so
 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.490
were than any government bureaucrat so
follow along at MIT from the beginning

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500
follow along at MIT from the beginning
 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.280
follow along at MIT from the beginning
it was this weird coexistence of these

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290
it was this weird coexistence of these
 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.830
it was this weird coexistence of these
very rationalist theories of how the

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840
very rationalist theories of how the
 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.470
very rationalist theories of how the
world worked coupled with this kind of

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:24.480
world worked coupled with this kind of
 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:26.780
world worked coupled with this kind of
understanding and a lot of classroom

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790
understanding and a lot of classroom
 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.880
understanding and a lot of classroom
discussion about how the world didn't

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890
discussion about how the world didn't
 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.580
discussion about how the world didn't
work quite the way it was described in

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590
work quite the way it was described in
 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.290
work quite the way it was described in
the mathematical models in the classroom

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:33.300
the mathematical models in the classroom
 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:35.390
the mathematical models in the classroom
and so you got people coming out of MIT

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400
and so you got people coming out of MIT
 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.350
and so you got people coming out of MIT
and Schiller's classmate Robert Merton

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.360
and Schiller's classmate Robert Merton
 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.720

Nobel Prize winner very sort of the high

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:41.730
Nobel Prize winner very sort of the high
 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:44.120
Nobel Prize winner very sort of the high
priest for a while of this rationalist

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130
priest for a while of this rationalist
 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.400
priest for a while of this rationalist
finance was there at the same time and

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:46.410
finance was there at the same time and
 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:47.720
finance was there at the same time and
came out with a very different world

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:47.730
came out with a very different world
 

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:49.780
came out with a very different world
view so Shiller came out with this

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:49.790
view so Shiller came out with this
 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:52.220
view so Shiller came out with this
conventional training but this sense

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:52.230
conventional training but this sense
 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:54.710
conventional training but this sense
that all these theories and models

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720
that all these theories and models
 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.250
that all these theories and models
weren't entirely right and any and he

00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:58.260
weren't entirely right and any and he
 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.260
weren't entirely right and any and he
had a lot of computer skills &amp; P racal

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270
had a lot of computer skills &amp; P racal
 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.120
had a lot of computer skills &amp; P racal
skills and so he started during the 70's

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130
skills and so he started during the 70's
 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.070
skills and so he started during the 70's
to just try to test some of these

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:04.080
to just try to test some of these
 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:05.930
to just try to test some of these
theories about market behavior against

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:05.940
theories about market behavior against
 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.149
theories about market behavior against
the data and initially he was looking at

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:08.159
the data and initially he was looking at
 

00:02:08.159 --> 00:02:10.910
the data and initially he was looking at
bond prices and and didn't come up with

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920
bond prices and and didn't come up with
 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.740
bond prices and and didn't come up with
anything all that explosive but then

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750
anything all that explosive but then
 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.509
anything all that explosive but then
starting to late 70s he started looking

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:14.519
starting to late 70s he started looking
 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:17.000
starting to late 70s he started looking
at stock prices and was trying to come

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010
at stock prices and was trying to come
 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.259
at stock prices and was trying to come
up with a measure of whether they

00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:18.269
up with a measure of whether they
 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:21.170
up with a measure of whether they
reflected the fundamental value of the

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180
reflected the fundamental value of the
 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:22.700
reflected the fundamental value of the
stocks themselves and so he just

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:22.710
stocks themselves and so he just
 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:24.890
stocks themselves and so he just
compared stock prices to dip to

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900
compared stock prices to dip to
 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.470
compared stock prices to dip to
subsequent dividend payments and found

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480
subsequent dividend payments and found
 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:28.880
subsequent dividend payments and found
that the dividend payments were a lot

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890
that the dividend payments were a lot
 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.440
that the dividend payments were a lot
less volatile than the stock price

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450
less volatile than the stock price
 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.720
less volatile than the stock price
movements and that wasn't proof of

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730
movements and that wasn't proof of
 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.310
movements and that wasn't proof of
anything a lot of people argued well

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320
anything a lot of people argued well
 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.350
anything a lot of people argued well
companies try to keep their dividends

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360
companies try to keep their dividends
 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.750
companies try to keep their dividends
smooth therefore it should mean that

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760
smooth therefore it should mean that
 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.190
smooth therefore it should mean that
much but other people did similar

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200
much but other people did similar
 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.650
much but other people did similar
examinations of earnings comparing them

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660
examinations of earnings comparing them
 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.140
examinations of earnings comparing them
with stock prices and basically the

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150
with stock prices and basically the
 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:46.730
with stock prices and basically the
lesson was there seemed to be a lot of

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:46.740
lesson was there seemed to be a lot of
 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:48.590
lesson was there seemed to be a lot of
unexplained volatility in the stock

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600
unexplained volatility in the stock
 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.770
unexplained volatility in the stock
market and and later on other people

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780
market and and later on other people
 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.000
market and and later on other people
including some pretty conventional

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010
including some pretty conventional
 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.070
including some pretty conventional
finance scholars like Richard roll at

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080
finance scholars like Richard roll at
 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.220

UCLA basically confirmed Schiller's

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230
UCLA basically confirmed Schiller's
 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.130
UCLA basically confirmed Schiller's
observation and so Schiller then he

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140
observation and so Schiller then he
 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:02.840
observation and so Schiller then he
actually went and paid paying attention

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:02.850
actually went and paid paying attention
 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:04.370
actually went and paid paying attention
to real estate for about 10 years but

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380
to real estate for about 10 years but
 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:06.170
to real estate for about 10 years but
when he came back to paying attention to

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180
when he came back to paying attention to
 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.420
when he came back to paying attention to
the stock market again in the mid to

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430
the stock market again in the mid to
 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:11.240
the stock market again in the mid to
late 90s it was just with this idea that

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250
late 90s it was just with this idea that
 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:15.130
late 90s it was just with this idea that
there were these periods when prices

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:15.140
there were these periods when prices
 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:18.230
there were these periods when prices
went off in directions that had less to

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:18.240
went off in directions that had less to
 

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:20.210
went off in directions that had less to
do with anything going on with the

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220
do with anything going on with the
 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.190
do with anything going on with the
fundamentals then I just then mood

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200
fundamentals then I just then mood
 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.760
fundamentals then I just then mood
swings and and so that that sort of led

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:25.770
swings and and so that that sort of led
 

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:28.250
swings and and so that that sort of led
him by the late 90s to be this really

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260
him by the late 90s to be this really
 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.130
him by the late 90s to be this really
prominent doubter about the bull market

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140
prominent doubter about the bull market
 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:32.660
prominent doubter about the bull market
of those days and then he came out with

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670
of those days and then he came out with
 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:35.570
of those days and then he came out with
I mean it was he totally admits this was

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:35.580
I mean it was he totally admits this was
 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:37.370
I mean it was he totally admits this was
luck but with the most spectacularly
