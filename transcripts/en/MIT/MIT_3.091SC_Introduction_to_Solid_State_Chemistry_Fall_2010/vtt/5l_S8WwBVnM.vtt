00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:22.570
PROFESSOR: OK, settle down.

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:23.980
Let's get started.

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:29.770
One announcement, yesterday we
had our first weekly I would

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:31.630
say minor celebration.

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:33.580
And by and large,
it went well.

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:36.840
Please make sure that you go to
your assigned recitation.

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.760
If you miss your recitation,
you need to get down to see

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.400
Hillary so that we make sure
that we have enough copies of

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.780
the weekly quizzes on hand.

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:49.490
If you've joined the class, you
have to check in with her.

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:52.910
She's down the hall here
in room 8-201.

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:54.310
And you'll be assigned
to a section.

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.560
What else do I have by
way of announcements?

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:00.520
Oh yes.

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:03.460
Just reminding you, this
was from 2003.

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:04.380
See it doesn't change.

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:09.470
It's the same s-block, p-block,
and d-block elements.

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:12.450
So that's coming up a week
from tomorrow, two

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.810
celebrations next.

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:20.790
And of course the contests, the
contests with hot prizes.

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.320
All right.

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.410
Let's get down to business.

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:27.220
Last day we looked at the
Rutherford-Geiger-Marsden

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:28.400
experiment.

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.820
Oh there's one other one.

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:33.380
If you look at the readings,
there's this one section

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:34.890
called the archives.

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.530
My predecessor, Professor Wit,
wrote a set of lecture notes.

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:41.880
And they look something
like this.

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.580
And some students have said that
they find these a little

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:49.080
more expository in certain
sections on certain topics

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.260
than the book to be.

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:52.660
And I have no preference.

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:55.520
But if you take a look at
this it'll say LN1,

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:56.810
lecture notes 1.

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:58.170
If you go to this, read this.

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.060
If you find that's
helpful, good.

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.710
If you don't find it helpful,
than stick with the book.

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:05.280
Just letting you know
what that is.

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.950
All right, so last day
we looked at the

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.250
Rutherford-Geiger-Marsden
experiment in which a high

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:15.290
energy beam of alpha particles
bombarded a thin, gold foil.

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:18.610
And on the basis of the
scattering results, namely

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:22.890
most of the particles went
through with minor scattering.

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.990
And a tiny fraction of
them were scattered

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:27.500
through large angles.

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.620
The Thomson plum pudding model
was rejected in favor of

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.500
Rutherford's nuclear
model of the atom.

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.240
And then subsequently, Bohr came
up with the quantitative

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:41.840
representation off the
Rutherford nuclear model.

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:47.040
And we were partway through the
treatment of Bohr last day

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:47.790
when we adjourned.

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.220
So let's right pick up the
thread from where we left off.

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:56.010
And so just to remind you, the
Bohr model is for a 1-electron

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.020
atom gas phase.

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:01.280
So this is either atomic
hydrogen, it could be helium

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:07.380
plus lithium 2 plus roentgenium
110 plus Its

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:08.830
doesn't matter how
many protons.

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:11.390
there's always only
want electron.

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:13.500
And it's a planetary model.

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.360
The positive charge concentrated
in the nucleus, Z

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:18.160
is the proton number.

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:22.910
And at a distance r from the
nucleus is a circular orbit in

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:25.075
which resides 1 electron.

00:03:25.075 --> 00:03:27.780
It has a charge of minus E.

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.180
And I just designated
them q1 and q2.

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:31.360
You could have done
it the other way.

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.060
But I had to choose something.

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:34.590
So we went through
and looked at the

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:35.950
constitutive equations here.

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:38.670
So first of all, the energy
of the system--

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:40.960
and this is only going to be
the energy the electron.

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:45.480
Because we assume that the
nucleus is far more massive.

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.100
And so we don't have to get into
things like reduced mass

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:48.830
or anything like that.

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:51.430
So just measure the energy
of the electron.

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:54.210
1/2 mv squared is the
newtonian component.

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:59.910
And then coulombic energy that's
stored is z times e

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:04.140
squared over 4 pi epsilon zero
r, where epsilon zero is the

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:05.430
permittivity of vacuum.

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:09.160
And it's the factor, the 4 pi
epsilon zero, is the factor

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.240
that allows us to take
electrostatic energies and put

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:16.525
them on the same plane as
mechanical energies.

00:04:16.525 --> 00:04:19.700
When we run through this, we
always end up in joules.

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:22.480
Then there's a force balanced to
make sure that the electron

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:25.890
neither falls into the
nucleus nor flees and

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:29.490
breaks free of the atom.

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:32.560
And the force balance is if you
put a ball at the end of a

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.830
string, and you whip it around
on a tether, you have a

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:38.040
centrifugal force that's trying
to get the ball to

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:38.760
break away.

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:41.260
And then the string
is pulling in.

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:45.270
So the pull in, in this case,
is the coulombic force.

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:49.340
And the force that makes the
ball want to flee is this mv

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:50.360
squared over r.

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:52.510
And that must be net zero.

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:55.380
Otherwise we're going to
have a shift in orbit.

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:57.530
And then lastly we have
the quantum condition.

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:02.270
And this was the breakthrough
of Bohr where he enunciated

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:06.910
that the quantum condition is
going to give us this energy

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:08.500
level quantization.

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:12.010
And this was a big departure
from what had been in the

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:16.150
past. The only antecedent idea
of this nature was the work by

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:18.700
Planck who said that
light is quantized.

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:20.900
But as I told you last
day, who knows what

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:22.070
light really is.

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:26.040
The Newtonian notion of
a ball orbiting was

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:27.780
very compelling here.

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:32.690
And the notion that the movement
of the electron could

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:37.380
in some way be discontinuous was
quite a major departure.

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:38.790
So I left you last
day with three

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:40.420
equations and three unknowns.

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:42.370
And what I'm not going
to do right now

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:44.080
is solve the equations.

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:46.390
Because I've been lecturing long
enough to know that's the

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:49.530
way to kill interest,
quench a lecture.

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:52.570
And so if you really want to go
through the algebra, be my

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:54.250
guest. You're smart
enough to do that.

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:55.650
Instead I'm going to show
you the results.

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:57.790
But those are the three
equations that you need.

00:05:57.790 --> 00:05:59.650
So we have an equation in r.

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:01.960
We have an equation at v,
and an equation in e.

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:03.430
So let's go after them.

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:07.020
If you first look at
the solution for r.

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:10.640
This is the radius of the orbit
of the electron, the

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:11.805
orbit of the electron.

00:06:11.805 --> 00:06:15.960
If you go through and solve,
you'll end up with this,

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:19.980
Epsilon zero times the square of
the Planck constant divided

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:22.720
by pi times m.

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:23.920
It's always the electron.

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:26.530
So this is the radius of
the electron orbit.

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:29.870
This is the mass of the electron
times the square of

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:31.840
the elementary charge--

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:33.730
that whole thing I'm
going to group--

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:37.540
times the square of the quantum
number divided by z,

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:39.720
the proton number.

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:41.050
So what we see here?

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:45.640
Well, everything inside the
parentheses is constant.

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:46.440
These are all constant.

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:48.750
Pi obviously is geometric
constant.

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:50.970
And the rest of these are
constants you could look up in

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:52.790
your table of constants.

00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:56.710
And we noticed that there is
a set of solutions to this.

00:06:56.710 --> 00:07:01.260
The radius of the electron can
occupy various discrete values

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:03.100
defined by n.

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:06.680
So we say that the radius takes
on a plurality of values

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:08.550
a function of n.

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:12.170
And furthermore, the
functionality goes as the

00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:12.910
square of n.

00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:16.330
It's n squared times a constant,
where that constant

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:18.770
is inside those parentheses.

00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:21.310
And we notice that because
the r goes as n

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:23.670
squared it's nonlinear.

00:07:23.670 --> 00:07:24.920
It's nonlinear.

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:30.350
This is so important I'm
going to write it

00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:31.280
down one more time.

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:41.725
So the radius of the electron
orbit takes multiple values.

00:07:41.725 --> 00:07:43.310
It takes multiple values.

00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:49.280
And they're discreet.

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:51.540
The physicists like to
use a different term.

00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:53.070
When something is
discretized, the

00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:56.540
physicists say it is quantized.

00:07:56.540 --> 00:07:58.380
So these values are quantized.

00:07:58.380 --> 00:08:07.610
You cannot continuously vary
the radius and nonlinear

00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:12.280
values, multiple values.

00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:15.900
So let's plug in.

00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:17.990
Because I want to get
a sense of scale.

00:08:17.990 --> 00:08:21.280
So let's look at the
simplest one.

00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:24.115
The most primitive 1-electron
atom would be hydrogen.

00:08:24.115 --> 00:08:26.280
In which case, Z equals 1.

00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:29.870
So I've just got a proton
orbited by an electron.

00:08:29.870 --> 00:08:35.170
So look at atomic hydrogen.

00:08:35.170 --> 00:08:38.950
So in that case, Z equals 1.

00:08:38.950 --> 00:08:42.790
And I'm going to look at n
equals 1, which is the lowest

00:08:42.790 --> 00:08:43.710
number here, right?

00:08:43.710 --> 00:08:45.120
R scales as n squared.

00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:49.130
So the lowest value or r is
obtained when n equals 1.

00:08:49.130 --> 00:08:52.230
And this is termed
the ground state.

00:08:52.230 --> 00:08:55.560
The ground state.

00:08:55.560 --> 00:09:01.210
So I want to ask what is the
radius of the electron orbit

00:09:01.210 --> 00:09:03.280
ground state in atomic
hydrogen?

00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:07.265
And if I plug in these values,
I'll call this r sub 1.

00:09:07.265 --> 00:09:16.590
It turns out to be 5.29 times 10
to the minus 11 meters, or

00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:22.390
0.529 angstroms. I love
the angstrom.

00:09:22.390 --> 00:09:23.640
It's a great unit.

00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:24.580
It's a great unit.

00:09:24.580 --> 00:09:26.460
It's not an SI unit.

00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:28.450
But I like the angstrom.

00:09:28.450 --> 00:09:29.510
I'll show you why.

00:09:29.510 --> 00:09:34.410
If you try to express this in
SI units, well there's 10 to

00:09:34.410 --> 00:09:36.990
the minus 11 meters.

00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:43.340
The Si units go in units
of clusters of 1,000.

00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:45.200
So for example, you've
got the meter.

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:46.660
You've got the kilometer.

00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:48.230
You've got the micrometer.

00:09:48.230 --> 00:09:51.160
You've got 10 to the
minus 9 meters,

00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:53.650
which is the nanometer.

00:09:56.250 --> 00:09:57.520
This is a Goldilocks problem.

00:09:57.520 --> 00:09:58.320
This one's too big.

00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:01.330
And then the next one down here
is 10 to the minus 12

00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:03.350
meters, which is
the picometer.

00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:07.960
So this is either 52.9
picometers, or a 0.0529

00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:09.970
nanometers.

00:10:09.970 --> 00:10:11.000
And that's no good.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.930
I want numbers like 3, 7,
simple to remember.

00:10:14.930 --> 00:10:20.740
So 0.529, this is about
1/2 angstrom.

00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:21.910
It's good to know.

00:10:21.910 --> 00:10:24.280
But you try to publish, you
know what happens in a

00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:25.910
scientific literature today?

00:10:25.910 --> 00:10:28.710
The Literary Lions that control
the journals, they'll

00:10:28.710 --> 00:10:31.510
circle that and say you have
to convert to SI units.

00:10:31.510 --> 00:10:32.930
And so they have to
right some goofy

00:10:32.930 --> 00:10:34.680
nanometer thing or something.

00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:37.430
I know you think I'm crazy,
but I love the angstrom.

00:10:37.430 --> 00:10:38.100
So there.

00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:39.890
Anyway, so here it is.

00:10:39.890 --> 00:10:43.770
Once you know that this is
0.529, this is on your table

00:10:43.770 --> 00:10:44.660
of constants.

00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:46.550
It's right on your table
of constants.

00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:48.880
So you don't have to go and
calculate all this stuff.

00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:52.110
Which means if you do your
homework with your table of

00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:56.080
constants, you will know where
those numbers lie, as opposed

00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:59.450
to opening this thing up for
the first time on the first

00:10:59.450 --> 00:11:02.800
celebration of learning on
October the 7th, and with 47

00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:04.910
entries and they're
tiny, tiny font.

00:11:04.910 --> 00:11:08.060
And you're wondering where
is that thing.

00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:09.140
Just a word to wise.

00:11:09.140 --> 00:11:10.860
So now we know what this is.

00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:14.650
We know this is 0.529 angstroms.
So now I can write

00:11:14.650 --> 00:11:17.770
an equation for the radius
of a 1-electron

00:11:17.770 --> 00:11:20.330
atom anywhere, anytime.

00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:26.600
r of n is going to be equal
to a naught which

00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:29.620
is this value here.

00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:31.460
And it is termed the
Bohr radius.

00:11:34.790 --> 00:11:37.050
So you can write it as a
function of the Bohr radius,

00:11:37.050 --> 00:11:41.750
times the square of
n divided by Z.

00:11:41.750 --> 00:11:45.230
So that's for all 1-electron
atoms, gas phase.

00:11:45.230 --> 00:11:50.930
And you can see that as Z goes
up, the r goes down, which

00:11:50.930 --> 00:11:51.520
makes sense.

00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:56.100
So suppose instead of hydrogen,
we talk helium plus

00:11:56.100 --> 00:11:57.020
What's the only difference?

00:11:57.020 --> 00:11:59.580
Helium plus has 2 protons
in the nucleus.

00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:03.090
Which means that the coulombic
force of attraction between

00:12:03.090 --> 00:12:07.010
the same 1-electron and now a
doubly charged nucleus is

00:12:07.010 --> 00:12:09.340
going to be stronger.

00:12:09.340 --> 00:12:11.320
So the first orbit is going
to get pulled in.

00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:14.210
And all the other orbits are
going to get pulled in.

00:12:14.210 --> 00:12:16.200
By how much are they going
to get pulled in?

00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:17.100
By that much.

00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:19.900
So this is the functional
representation

00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:21.730
of all of that physics.

00:12:21.730 --> 00:12:23.540
All right, there's three
equations, three unknowns.

00:12:23.540 --> 00:12:24.930
Let's look at energy.

00:12:24.930 --> 00:12:27.960
So if you go through and solve
for energy, you get this one.

00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:31.840
Minus this big monstrosity, mass
of the electron to the

00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:37.390
fourth power of the elementary
charge times 8 times the

00:12:37.390 --> 00:12:41.470
square of the permittivity of
vacuum times the square of the

00:12:41.470 --> 00:12:47.740
Planck constant, all times the
square of the Proton number

00:12:47.740 --> 00:12:52.630
divided by the square of
the quantum number.

00:12:52.630 --> 00:12:56.080
And I just to make sure
everybody is with me here.

00:12:56.080 --> 00:13:01.430
I always want to write n here.
n equals 1, 2, 3, takes on

00:13:01.430 --> 00:13:02.710
integer values.

00:13:02.710 --> 00:13:04.090
And we'll say it again here.

00:13:04.090 --> 00:13:08.530
N equals 1, 2, 3, et
cetera, et cetera.

00:13:08.530 --> 00:13:15.020
So again we say we see that
e is a function of n.

00:13:15.020 --> 00:13:15.720
It's discretized.

00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:17.890
It's quantized.

00:13:17.890 --> 00:13:18.580
Why?

00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:22.330
Because once you impose the
quantum condition here on

00:13:22.330 --> 00:13:24.470
angular momentum, it propagates

00:13:24.470 --> 00:13:25.880
through the entire model.

00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:28.470
So radius this quantized, energy
is quantized, you're

00:13:28.470 --> 00:13:29.970
going to see velocity
is quantized.

00:13:29.970 --> 00:13:33.740
Because the quantum condition
is pervasive.

00:13:33.740 --> 00:13:38.110
So e to the n, and I'm going to
take this whole quantity in

00:13:38.110 --> 00:13:42.810
parentheses and just
call it giant K.

00:13:42.810 --> 00:13:44.600
These are all positive
quantities.

00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:45.720
Mass is positive.

00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:49.010
And squares and fourth powers
of numbers must be positive.

00:13:49.010 --> 00:13:56.650
So this is K times Z squared
over n squared That's good.

00:13:56.650 --> 00:13:59.210
And we can go and evaluate K.

00:13:59.210 --> 00:14:05.990
And when we evaluate L in SI
units, we get 2.18 times 10 to

00:14:05.990 --> 00:14:10.500
the minus 18 joules.

00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:13.450
This is joules per atom.

00:14:13.450 --> 00:14:16.750
Or you can multiply this
by Avogadro's number.

00:14:16.750 --> 00:14:19.230
If you multiply it by Avogadro's
number, then that

00:14:19.230 --> 00:14:28.270
will give you 1.312 megajoules
per mol.

00:14:28.270 --> 00:14:32.700
So that's the energy of the
electron in the ground state

00:14:32.700 --> 00:14:34.730
of atomic hydrogen.

00:14:34.730 --> 00:14:39.000
And then we can mediate that
with Z and n, and go to

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.870
electrons that are outside the
ground state, above the ground

00:14:41.870 --> 00:14:45.160
state, or ground state electrons
in atoms that have

00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:47.800
more than 1 proton, or both.

00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:50.630
And so let's take a look
at the graphical

00:14:50.630 --> 00:14:51.790
representation of that.

00:14:51.790 --> 00:14:55.030
So instead of Cartesian
coordinates, because this is

00:14:55.030 --> 00:14:57.450
spatial distribution, I'm
going to go to energy

00:14:57.450 --> 00:15:00.080
coordinates and give you an
energy level diagram.

00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:05.700
So again, not to scale.

00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:08.940
Because this thing goes
is 1 over the square.

00:15:08.940 --> 00:15:10.300
So that's going to be messy.

00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:12.360
So let's start here.

00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:15.535
And on the left side I'm going
to designate the energy.

00:15:15.535 --> 00:15:17.590
And on the right side
I'm going to

00:15:17.590 --> 00:15:18.950
designate the quantum number.

00:15:18.950 --> 00:15:20.280
I'm going to start down here.

00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:21.470
That's the lowest energy.

00:15:21.470 --> 00:15:23.810
You see these are all negative
values, first of all.

00:15:23.810 --> 00:15:25.670
They're all negative values.

00:15:25.670 --> 00:15:27.910
Because Z is a square,
n is a square, and K

00:15:27.910 --> 00:15:29.750
is a positive quantity.

00:15:29.750 --> 00:15:31.600
So n equals 1 is the
lowest state.

00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:32.770
It's the ground state.

00:15:32.770 --> 00:15:37.680
It has a value of minus K.

00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:40.660
So I'm going to do this one
just for atomic hydrogen.

00:15:40.660 --> 00:15:44.440
So I'm going to write
atomic H.

00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:47.900
So now Z equals 1.

00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:51.520
You can do it later for Z
equals 2, 3, whatever.

00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:52.850
So this is atomic hydrogen.

00:15:52.850 --> 00:15:56.580
So ground state energy
is minus K.

00:15:56.580 --> 00:15:59.700
What happens if we go to n
equals 2? n equals 2 it

00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:02.460
becomes K divided
by 2 squared 4.

00:16:02.460 --> 00:16:04.000
So it should be 3/4
of the way up.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.180
I'm not going to go quite
3/4 of the way.

00:16:06.180 --> 00:16:08.710
Because I want to leave room
for some fine structure.

00:16:08.710 --> 00:16:10.380
That's why it's not to scale.

00:16:10.380 --> 00:16:13.200
All right so this is
minus L over 4.

00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:15.060
What if we go to n equals 3?

00:16:15.060 --> 00:16:16.430
Well it's not symmetric here.

00:16:16.430 --> 00:16:17.150
It's nonlinear.

00:16:17.150 --> 00:16:18.940
But this should be
really what?

00:16:18.940 --> 00:16:21.880
Minus K over 3 squared is 9.

00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:22.720
You get the picture.

00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:27.170
3, you can go 4, 5, and so on
until n equals infinity.

00:16:27.170 --> 00:16:29.450
What happens when n
equals infinity?

00:16:29.450 --> 00:16:33.210
I've got minus K over infinity,
which is vanishingly

00:16:33.210 --> 00:16:34.840
small, zero.

00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:38.590
Where is the electron when
n equals infinity?

00:16:38.590 --> 00:16:42.740
r is n squared times
the Bohr radius.

00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:46.830
That's a great, great
distance away.

00:16:46.830 --> 00:16:47.870
What does it mean?

00:16:47.870 --> 00:16:50.810
Physically it means that the
electron is so far away that

00:16:50.810 --> 00:16:52.190
it is no longer bound.

00:16:52.190 --> 00:16:55.710
It's no longer part
of the atom.

00:16:55.710 --> 00:16:58.910
And when it's no longer part of
the atom, and the potential

00:16:58.910 --> 00:17:01.920
energy that's stored is a result
of the charges coming

00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:03.630
together from infinity.

00:17:03.630 --> 00:17:05.800
I'm starting to talk like
someone out of 802.

00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:09.480
What's the energy if I take 2
charged particles at infinite

00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:10.210
separation?

00:17:10.210 --> 00:17:12.510
I bring them into some
finite separation.

00:17:12.510 --> 00:17:13.170
Voila.

00:17:13.170 --> 00:17:13.970
There it is.

00:17:13.970 --> 00:17:15.590
So when they're in infinite
separation

00:17:15.590 --> 00:17:17.030
there's no energy stored.

00:17:17.030 --> 00:17:18.850
Hence, you are at that point.

00:17:18.850 --> 00:17:25.000
So n equals infinity means r
equals infinity, which means E

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:25.780
equal zero.

00:17:25.780 --> 00:17:27.590
There's no stored energy.

00:17:27.590 --> 00:17:30.570
So this means the electron
is no longer bound.

00:17:33.940 --> 00:17:37.080
And therefore, if it's
no longer bound, we

00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:37.930
have a term for it.

00:17:37.930 --> 00:17:39.440
It's called free.

00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:42.290
It's a free electron.

00:17:42.290 --> 00:17:44.480
And if the electron
is free, then the

00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:48.565
atom is electron deficient.

00:17:48.565 --> 00:17:50.780
So if the electron is
free, that means the

00:17:50.780 --> 00:17:54.810
atom is now an ion.

00:17:54.810 --> 00:17:56.225
Because it's lost an electron.

00:17:56.225 --> 00:17:57.990
It's no longer net neutral.

00:17:57.990 --> 00:18:03.800
Or we say an atom hasn't
turned into an ion.

00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:06.200
Or the electron has
been ionized.

00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:14.130
What's the energy for that?

00:18:14.130 --> 00:18:15.740
We can calculate what
that energy is.

00:18:15.740 --> 00:18:17.760
It would be called the
ionization energy.

00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:20.620
So if I started with an electron
down in here, and I

00:18:20.620 --> 00:18:23.090
sent it all the way
to infinity.

00:18:23.090 --> 00:18:24.490
See that's an energy space.

00:18:24.490 --> 00:18:27.410
Which is the equivalent in
Cartesian space to go from

00:18:27.410 --> 00:18:30.510
here to infinity, same idea.

00:18:30.510 --> 00:18:32.040
Do you see the models?

00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:34.460
This is Cartesian.

00:18:34.460 --> 00:18:34.900
It's like a.

00:18:34.900 --> 00:18:37.450
Map This is energy
coordinates.

00:18:37.450 --> 00:18:38.740
It's different.

00:18:38.740 --> 00:18:40.210
And you're going to be
able to think from

00:18:40.210 --> 00:18:41.600
one model to another.

00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:43.050
What's the energy
consequences?

00:18:43.050 --> 00:18:44.980
What are the Cartesian
consequences?

00:18:44.980 --> 00:18:46.980
Until we get to the point where
there is no Cartesian

00:18:46.980 --> 00:18:47.790
representation.

00:18:47.790 --> 00:18:50.560
Because the abstraction level
is too high, we'll have to

00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:51.720
content ourselves with this.

00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:54.000
So get comfortable moving
from there to there.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.550
And then some day we're going
to say it's too complicated.

00:18:56.550 --> 00:18:58.240
There's no Cartesian thing.

00:18:58.240 --> 00:18:59.800
We'll be comfortable
by then with this.

00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:02.580
OK so now we're taking an
electron from here up to here.

00:19:02.580 --> 00:19:06.600
While we ask, what is the
ionization energy?

00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:10.370
The ionization energy must
equal the delta E of the

00:19:10.370 --> 00:19:11.620
transition.

00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:15.230
So what's that?

00:19:15.230 --> 00:19:18.560
The delta E of the transition
is going to equal always E

00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:22.360
final minus E initial.

00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:25.290
E final minus E initial.

00:19:25.290 --> 00:19:29.530
Which is equal to E
at infinity minus

00:19:29.530 --> 00:19:32.000
E1, the ground state.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.540
Well E infinity, we just
said, is zero.

00:19:34.540 --> 00:19:38.630
And the ground state energy
is equal to minus K.

00:19:38.630 --> 00:19:40.860
So minus minus K is K.

00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:44.120
So you also get the energy.

00:19:44.120 --> 00:19:47.090
From infinity down to
ground state is

00:19:47.090 --> 00:19:48.960
the ionization energy.

00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:58.050
So we can define the ionization
energy in terms of

00:19:58.050 --> 00:19:59.610
this transition.

00:19:59.610 --> 00:20:06.280
Define ionization energy as the
minimum energy to remove

00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:23.430
an electron from the
ground state of an

00:20:23.430 --> 00:20:24.733
atom in a gas phase.

00:20:31.020 --> 00:20:32.640
So that means there's no
solids, no liquids.

00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:33.980
There's no work function here.

00:20:33.980 --> 00:20:36.410
There's no lattice energy,
and so on.

00:20:36.410 --> 00:20:40.340
So there's a definition of
the ionization energy.

00:20:40.340 --> 00:20:42.880
And we can be a little
bit more elaborate.

00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:44.300
Even though right now I'm
just going to do a

00:20:44.300 --> 00:20:45.380
little break here.

00:20:45.380 --> 00:20:46.620
I don't want to mislead
people.

00:20:46.620 --> 00:20:49.620
But just an aside.

00:20:49.620 --> 00:20:51.110
I'm nonlinear.

00:20:51.110 --> 00:20:53.070
I can have multiple
conversations at once.

00:20:53.070 --> 00:20:54.910
And you are capable
of stacking.

00:20:54.910 --> 00:20:56.130
So we're going to break now.

00:20:56.130 --> 00:20:58.160
We're not going to talk
about 1-electron atom.

00:20:58.160 --> 00:21:01.900
We're going to follow the thread
of ionization energy.

00:21:01.900 --> 00:21:03.310
I'm going to take lithium.

00:21:03.310 --> 00:21:08.250
Lithium in its normal state has
3 protons, 3 electrons.

00:21:08.250 --> 00:21:10.140
So I'm going to take
lithium gas.

00:21:10.140 --> 00:21:13.800
And I'm going to ionize it
and make lithium plus.

00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:16.230
So this is a lithium plus
ion in the gas phase.

00:21:16.230 --> 00:21:17.760
It's still got 2 electrons.

00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:19.330
So this isn't Bohr
model stuff.

00:21:19.330 --> 00:21:21.880
But anyway, here we are.

00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:26.470
So the energy for this action
would be called

00:21:26.470 --> 00:21:27.690
the ionization energy.

00:21:27.690 --> 00:21:31.437
Because I took a neutral atom,
and I pulled an electron out

00:21:31.437 --> 00:21:32.910
of the ground state,
and so on.

00:21:32.910 --> 00:21:34.140
So this is an ionization
energy.

00:21:34.140 --> 00:21:36.790
But now I can continue
this process.

00:21:36.790 --> 00:21:39.860
And I can take Lithium plus.

00:21:39.860 --> 00:21:42.900
And I can lose an electron from
that, which will than

00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:45.970
give me lithium 2 plus.

00:21:45.970 --> 00:21:48.150
And this is called also
an ionization energy.

00:21:48.150 --> 00:21:50.710
This is called the second
ionization energy.

00:21:50.710 --> 00:21:52.320
So this is the first
ionization energy.

00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:55.650
But just as when you write an
equation, when the coefficient

00:21:55.650 --> 00:21:59.450
is 1, you don't write the 1.

00:21:59.450 --> 00:22:01.110
I don't write 1 lithium here.

00:22:01.110 --> 00:22:02.360
I know it's 1.

00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:04.460
This is the second ionization
energy.

00:22:04.460 --> 00:22:06.700
And then I can keep stripping
away electrons.

00:22:06.700 --> 00:22:11.010
And I can take lithium 2 plus
in the gas phase, and take

00:22:11.010 --> 00:22:16.120
away that electron leaving me
with just the lithium nucleus,

00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:19.060
lithium 3 plus, plus electron.

00:22:19.060 --> 00:22:23.260
And that's called the third
ionization energy.

00:22:23.260 --> 00:22:25.340
OK, now what can we say?

00:22:25.340 --> 00:22:29.530
What's the relationship here
between any of this except the

00:22:29.530 --> 00:22:31.860
definition and the Bohr model?

00:22:31.860 --> 00:22:32.250
well?

00:22:32.250 --> 00:22:35.810
The Bohr model applies only to
1-electron atoms. Are there

00:22:35.810 --> 00:22:40.270
any 1-electron atoms
on this board?

00:22:40.270 --> 00:22:42.460
So we can calculate
the energy, the

00:22:42.460 --> 00:22:43.820
third ionization energy.

00:22:43.820 --> 00:22:45.730
We can get that from
the Bohr model.

00:22:48.330 --> 00:22:49.820
You can do it in your head.

00:22:49.820 --> 00:22:51.360
You can do it in your
head right?

00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:55.520
It's just K times Z squared
right here.

00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:56.630
It's going from 1.

00:22:56.630 --> 00:23:02.480
So if this is 2.18, it's going
to be 9 times that trivially.

00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:08.040
OK, so this is just
3 squared times K.

00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:11.860
And this when you have to
get from the literature.

00:23:11.860 --> 00:23:14.000
So you have to go to
primary sources.

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:15.060
Which is why you're going
to learn how to

00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:17.530
use the proper database.

00:23:17.530 --> 00:23:20.070
And this one here also you
get from the literature.

00:23:20.070 --> 00:23:23.020
But this is on your
periodic table.

00:23:23.020 --> 00:23:26.040
Your periodic table, one of the
data points it gives is

00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:28.960
the first ionization energy
of all of the elements.

00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:31.790
And so even though lithium
normally is a solid at room

00:23:31.790 --> 00:23:35.140
temperature, the ionization
energy for lithium as given on

00:23:35.140 --> 00:23:36.945
your periodic table is
for this reaction.

00:23:36.945 --> 00:23:40.100
It's for the gas.

00:23:40.100 --> 00:23:40.400
Anyway.

00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:42.660
So that's little aside.

00:23:42.660 --> 00:23:46.410
All right, the last quantity
that we could get from the

00:23:46.410 --> 00:23:49.690
Bohr model is v, the velocity.

00:23:49.690 --> 00:23:50.730
And I solve for the velocity.

00:23:50.730 --> 00:23:52.240
We don't talk about
this very much.

00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:56.950
But we're going to
do so once today.

00:23:56.950 --> 00:23:58.210
And here it is.

00:23:58.210 --> 00:23:59.820
So I went through the algebra.

00:23:59.820 --> 00:24:05.780
And you get nh over 2 pi mr,
where r is the radius.

00:24:05.780 --> 00:24:07.020
There's the quantum number.

00:24:07.020 --> 00:24:08.600
This is quantized as well.

00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:09.830
So I regrouped this.

00:24:09.830 --> 00:24:12.800
And I already have a nice, cool
expression for r in terms

00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:14.070
of the Bohr radius.

00:24:14.070 --> 00:24:16.910
So I use that because
that's on the table.

00:24:16.910 --> 00:24:20.690
So this is 2 pi times the mass
of the electron times the Bohr

00:24:20.690 --> 00:24:28.240
radius, 1/2 angstrom, times Z
proton number divided by n,

00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:32.810
where n equals 1,
2, 3, and so on.

00:24:32.810 --> 00:24:34.980
So let's again get
a sense of scale.

00:24:34.980 --> 00:24:38.160
So let's try for
sense of scale.

00:24:41.540 --> 00:24:45.950
Let's do velocity of the ground
state electron in

00:24:45.950 --> 00:24:47.350
atomic hydrogen.

00:24:47.350 --> 00:24:51.080
So that means Z equals
1, n equals 1.

00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:52.760
So I plug in the numbers.

00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:59.800
And I get v1 for hydrogen,
atomic hydrogen, gives me 2.18

00:24:59.800 --> 00:25:02.870
times 10 to the 6 meters
for second.

00:25:06.870 --> 00:25:07.180
I don't know.

00:25:07.180 --> 00:25:07.950
Is that fast?

00:25:07.950 --> 00:25:08.880
Is that slow?

00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:09.260
I don't know.

00:25:09.260 --> 00:25:10.490
But I do know this much.

00:25:10.490 --> 00:25:14.890
I know that the speed of light
is equal to 3 times 10 to the

00:25:14.890 --> 00:25:16.943
8 meters per second.

00:25:20.500 --> 00:25:24.080
So 10 to the 8 divided
by 10 to the 6.

00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:27.280
2 and 3, that's roughly 1,
speaking as an engineer.

00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:28.620
Who cares?

00:25:28.620 --> 00:25:32.540
So this is about 1% of
the speed of light.

00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:36.790
That's pretty good.

00:25:36.790 --> 00:25:38.960
That gives me something
I can hang on to.

00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:42.900
I would say that if this thing
is zipping around at 1% of the

00:25:42.900 --> 00:25:50.090
speed of light, I would say
that's relatively fast. One

00:25:50.090 --> 00:25:52.060
more time, 1% of the
speed of light.

00:25:52.060 --> 00:25:58.030
That's relatively fast.

00:25:58.030 --> 00:26:01.560
Remember last day I told you
that Bohr simply dismissed the

00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:06.850
concept of the use of classical
electrodynamics down

00:26:06.850 --> 00:26:08.270
to atomic dimensions.

00:26:08.270 --> 00:26:11.840
Well here's another example of
why a lot of these assumptions

00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:13.250
aren't going to work so well.

00:26:13.250 --> 00:26:17.330
We're talking about the ground
state electron velocity in

00:26:17.330 --> 00:26:21.140
this putative planetary model
of a 1-electron atom.

00:26:21.140 --> 00:26:23.010
You're already getting into
relativistic effects.

00:26:23.010 --> 00:26:25.120
So, just another example.

00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:29.592
By the way, why do we use the
letter c for speed of light?

00:26:29.592 --> 00:26:31.420
It comes from the latin word

00:26:31.420 --> 00:26:35.530
celeritas, which means swiftness.

00:26:35.530 --> 00:26:38.200
And we get the modern
word acceleration,

00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:40.150
deceleration from that.

00:26:40.150 --> 00:26:41.150
OK.

00:26:41.150 --> 00:26:41.430
All right.

00:26:41.430 --> 00:26:45.430
So the Bohr model, we've
now rolled it all out.

00:26:45.430 --> 00:26:46.890
We have the energy portrait.

00:26:46.890 --> 00:26:49.230
We have the radii, discrete.

00:26:49.230 --> 00:26:50.750
We have quantization.

00:26:50.750 --> 00:26:52.660
And we have velocities
if we ever want to

00:26:52.660 --> 00:26:53.550
look at those again.

00:26:53.550 --> 00:26:56.120
Now what's the next thing
we do in science?

00:26:56.120 --> 00:27:00.110
We compare the predictions of
the Bohr model with data.

00:27:00.110 --> 00:27:01.640
Are there any data
to support this?

00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:04.370
Because remember, all Rutherford
said was plum

00:27:04.370 --> 00:27:05.690
pudding doesn't make sense.

00:27:05.690 --> 00:27:08.070
Instead I'm going to concentrate
the positive mass

00:27:08.070 --> 00:27:08.950
in the center.

00:27:08.950 --> 00:27:12.030
And then Bohr came along and
said, not only is it going to

00:27:12.030 --> 00:27:15.350
be a planetary model, I'm going
to have circular orbits.

00:27:15.350 --> 00:27:17.600
So now we've gone a long way
from Geiger-Marsden.

00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:19.700
So is there any data?

00:27:19.700 --> 00:27:23.620
Well there were data in 1853.

00:27:23.620 --> 00:27:26.500
Remember, Bohr published
this in 1913.

00:27:26.500 --> 00:27:30.820
In 1853 there was a
spectroscopist by the name--

00:27:30.820 --> 00:27:32.570
I'm going to tell
you his name--

00:27:32.570 --> 00:27:36.360
in Uppsala, Sweden.

00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:38.570
And his name was Angstrom.

00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:45.710
Angstrom was doing experiments
on hydrogen in

00:27:45.710 --> 00:27:48.140
gas discharge tubes.

00:27:48.140 --> 00:27:58.680
So he measured emissions from
gas discharge tube.

00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:04.810
And it was filled with
various gases

00:28:04.810 --> 00:28:08.890
including atomic hydrogen.

00:28:08.890 --> 00:28:12.550
And in order to take his
data, what he used

00:28:12.550 --> 00:28:15.050
was this device here--

00:28:15.050 --> 00:28:17.330
there's the Bohr radius,
just an example.

00:28:17.330 --> 00:28:19.740
He used the prism
spectrograph.

00:28:19.740 --> 00:28:21.230
So here's a gas discharge
tube.

00:28:21.230 --> 00:28:23.300
And I'm going to show you the
physics of that in a second.

00:28:23.300 --> 00:28:24.890
Basically you've got a
pair of electrodes.

00:28:24.890 --> 00:28:26.135
You've got gas in the tube.

00:28:26.135 --> 00:28:30.080
And as this cartoon shows, you
apply a potential across the

00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:30.750
electrodes.

00:28:30.750 --> 00:28:33.170
And beyond a certain threshold
potential, the

00:28:33.170 --> 00:28:34.860
tube begins to glow.

00:28:34.860 --> 00:28:36.530
And the glow goes in
all directions.

00:28:36.530 --> 00:28:38.110
And a blinds you when
you're in the lab.

00:28:38.110 --> 00:28:40.410
So what you do, is you
cover this up a bit.

00:28:40.410 --> 00:28:41.760
You have a narrow slit.

00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:44.260
And then you force the light
to come through in a thin

00:28:44.260 --> 00:28:46.880
ribbon, and then expose
it to a prism.

00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:50.850
What the prism does, is it takes
the light and breaks it

00:28:50.850 --> 00:28:54.490
into its components, sort of
rainbow-like, and magnifies

00:28:54.490 --> 00:28:56.630
the difference.

00:28:56.630 --> 00:28:59.560
As refraction goes, different
wavelengths will refract

00:28:59.560 --> 00:29:00.550
different amounts.

00:29:00.550 --> 00:29:02.420
And then you shoot this
across the room.

00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:06.430
There's two counters.

00:29:06.430 --> 00:29:09.340
One is a scintillation screen
and an army of graduate

00:29:09.340 --> 00:29:10.980
students who sit there
in the dark.

00:29:10.980 --> 00:29:13.690
But they're no good because you
can't stick them into the

00:29:13.690 --> 00:29:14.570
publication.

00:29:14.570 --> 00:29:17.120
You need to have data that
people will rely upon.

00:29:17.120 --> 00:29:19.460
So instead you use a
photographic plate.

00:29:19.460 --> 00:29:23.740
And if you put even a tiny,
tiny angle of separation

00:29:23.740 --> 00:29:26.380
across a great enough distance,
you start to get

00:29:26.380 --> 00:29:28.090
enough line splitting
that you can see.

00:29:28.090 --> 00:29:29.030
And then you go backwards.

00:29:29.030 --> 00:29:30.230
And you know the
geometry here.

00:29:30.230 --> 00:29:32.870
And you can figure out what the
wavelength must have been

00:29:32.870 --> 00:29:34.710
to go this distance, et
cetera, et cetera.

00:29:34.710 --> 00:29:38.070
And these are all color coded,
not because they had color

00:29:38.070 --> 00:29:41.400
film in those days, but just
to let you know that 656

00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:45.150
nanometers, if you were the
graduate student sitting

00:29:45.150 --> 00:29:47.470
there, you'd see a red line, a
green line, a blue line, and a

00:29:47.470 --> 00:29:49.330
violent line.

00:29:49.330 --> 00:29:50.580
So that's how he made
the measurements.

00:29:54.070 --> 00:29:56.140
And he published those
measurements.

00:29:56.140 --> 00:30:00.510
And so they lay.

00:30:00.510 --> 00:30:03.620
And then the story gets
a little thicker.

00:30:03.620 --> 00:30:09.310
In 1885, there's a Swiss high
school math teacher.

00:30:09.310 --> 00:30:10.720
I mean, I can't make
this stuff.

00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:12.030
This is true story.

00:30:12.030 --> 00:30:15.040
There's a Swiss high school math
teacher by the name of J.

00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:15.310
J.

00:30:15.310 --> 00:30:16.290
Balmer.

00:30:16.290 --> 00:30:16.720
We had J.

00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:16.940
J.

00:30:16.940 --> 00:30:17.440
Thomson.

00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:18.070
Now we've got J.

00:30:18.070 --> 00:30:18.280
J.

00:30:18.280 --> 00:30:19.300
Balmer.

00:30:19.300 --> 00:30:19.630
And J.

00:30:19.630 --> 00:30:19.770
J.

00:30:19.770 --> 00:30:22.620
Balmer, he loved to
play with numbers.

00:30:22.620 --> 00:30:25.640
And he was studying
this set of lines.

00:30:25.640 --> 00:30:27.730
And he was trying to come
up with a pattern.

00:30:27.730 --> 00:30:28.840
Can you see a pattern there?

00:30:28.840 --> 00:30:33.160
410 434 486, 656, do
they go squares?

00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:35.180
Are they primes?

00:30:35.180 --> 00:30:36.380
What's the pattern there?

00:30:36.380 --> 00:30:39.440
So Balmer puzzled over
this for awhile.

00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:42.480
And he finally came up with
the equation to represent

00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:43.650
those lines.

00:30:43.650 --> 00:30:49.640
So he studied Angstrom's
data found the pattern.

00:30:53.150 --> 00:30:54.870
And here's the pattern
that he found.

00:30:54.870 --> 00:30:58.450
He said that those
are wavelengths.

00:30:58.450 --> 00:31:04.720
If I take instead wave number,
nu bar is called wave number,

00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:09.660
which is the reciprocal
of the wavelength.

00:31:09.660 --> 00:31:13.430
So if I take the reciprocal of
the wavelength, I end up with

00:31:13.430 --> 00:31:17.980
those 4 lines conforming to a
series that goes like this.

00:31:17.980 --> 00:31:22.780
1 over 2 squared minus 1
over n squared, where n

00:31:22.780 --> 00:31:27.260
equals 3, 4, 5, 6.

00:31:27.260 --> 00:31:30.510
And there's a constant here
which we're going

00:31:30.510 --> 00:31:32.330
to designate r.

00:31:32.330 --> 00:31:34.790
And the value of R--

00:31:34.790 --> 00:31:37.480
I'm going to put that
on the next board--

00:31:37.480 --> 00:31:43.040
the value of R as expressed in
SI units today, would be 1.1

00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:46.740
times 10 to the 7 reciprocal
meters.

00:31:46.740 --> 00:31:48.390
Wavelength is a meter.

00:31:48.390 --> 00:31:50.370
Reciprocal wavelength
or wave number must

00:31:50.370 --> 00:31:52.120
be reciprocal meters.

00:31:52.120 --> 00:31:56.160
So how this all of this support
the Bohr model?

00:31:56.160 --> 00:31:58.450
Well in order to explain it,
I've got a first tell you what

00:31:58.450 --> 00:32:01.200
the physics of the gas
discharge tube are.

00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:06.520
So let's go inside the gas
discharge tube and understand

00:32:06.520 --> 00:32:07.200
those physics.

00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:09.410
So here's the gas
discharge tube.

00:32:09.410 --> 00:32:12.830
It's made are borosilicate
glass.

00:32:12.830 --> 00:32:15.390
And we fill it with gas.

00:32:15.390 --> 00:32:19.530
And in this case, the gas is
going to contain among other

00:32:19.530 --> 00:32:21.660
things hydrogen.

00:32:21.660 --> 00:32:25.120
So this is a hydrogen
gas phase atom.

00:32:25.120 --> 00:32:27.340
And this is probably
at low pressure.

00:32:27.340 --> 00:32:29.330
And then I said I
need electrode.

00:32:29.330 --> 00:32:31.200
I'll get the electrodes
inside.

00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:33.320
So I've got to have a really
good glass blower who can make

00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:35.330
a glass to metal seal,
and have a

00:32:35.330 --> 00:32:37.670
feedthrough to an electrode.

00:32:37.670 --> 00:32:39.800
So this is still
a vacuum seal.

00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:41.420
How do they get the gas
in the first place?

00:32:41.420 --> 00:32:42.550
We don't show you this
in the books.

00:32:42.550 --> 00:32:44.430
I'll tell you because I
did this in my Ph.D.

00:32:44.430 --> 00:32:47.430
What you do is you have a
little side tube here.

00:32:47.430 --> 00:32:49.380
You evacuate.

00:32:49.380 --> 00:32:52.300
This goes to a vacuum pump.

00:32:52.300 --> 00:32:54.190
And then over here you
have a gas source.

00:32:54.190 --> 00:32:55.440
You evacuate.

00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:57.520
Put in the gas to whatever
pressure you want.

00:32:57.520 --> 00:33:00.230
And then the glass blower
disconnects.

00:33:00.230 --> 00:33:02.170
This pulls this down
to a reduced

00:33:02.170 --> 00:33:05.200
pressure, and seals it.

00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:06.880
But the books don't
show you that.

00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:09.650
That's a secret.

00:33:09.650 --> 00:33:11.310
So we've got a gas
at low pressure.

00:33:11.310 --> 00:33:13.320
And I've got an electrode
over here and an

00:33:13.320 --> 00:33:14.270
electrode over here.

00:33:14.270 --> 00:33:18.055
And they're connected to a
variable voltage power supply.

00:33:18.055 --> 00:33:20.200
So I'm going to put an arrow
with the V meaning it's

00:33:20.200 --> 00:33:21.070
variable voltage.

00:33:21.070 --> 00:33:22.650
I can change the voltage.

00:33:22.650 --> 00:33:24.730
And this convention, this
is the negative side.

00:33:24.730 --> 00:33:26.680
So this means the electrons
leave the power

00:33:26.680 --> 00:33:27.950
supply and go like this.

00:33:27.950 --> 00:33:30.300
Which means this electrode
will be negative.

00:33:30.300 --> 00:33:32.530
And this electrode
will be positive.

00:33:32.530 --> 00:33:35.390
And thanks to Michael Faraday,
we will call

00:33:35.390 --> 00:33:37.270
this one the cathode.

00:33:37.270 --> 00:33:39.100
And this one we will
call the anode.

00:33:41.880 --> 00:33:43.080
Now what happens?

00:33:43.080 --> 00:33:45.660
We start turning up the
pressure, turning up the

00:33:45.660 --> 00:33:46.650
voltage rather.

00:33:46.650 --> 00:33:47.820
Low pressure here, but

00:33:47.820 --> 00:33:49.890
electrical pressure is voltage.

00:33:49.890 --> 00:33:53.760
The voltage gets high enough,
eventually the electrons will

00:33:53.760 --> 00:33:56.170
boil off the cathode.

00:33:56.170 --> 00:33:58.030
And this is a gas
at low pressure.

00:33:58.030 --> 00:34:00.690
And they will accelerate from
rest and go all the way across

00:34:00.690 --> 00:34:03.120
the tube and crash
into the anode.

00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:05.130
And we complete the circuit.

00:34:05.130 --> 00:34:07.770
But if there's a gas in here,
some of these electrons are

00:34:07.770 --> 00:34:10.000
going to hit the
gas molecules.

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:12.330
And when they hit the gas
molecules, if they have enough

00:34:12.330 --> 00:34:17.760
energy to do so, they will cause
electrons inside the gas

00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:19.730
molecules to be excited.

00:34:23.170 --> 00:34:26.740
And if they're excited enough,
the electrons will jump up to

00:34:26.740 --> 00:34:28.100
a higher energy level.

00:34:28.100 --> 00:34:30.180
But they can't be sustained.

00:34:30.180 --> 00:34:32.410
Because this is a ballistic
collision.

00:34:32.410 --> 00:34:33.220
It's a one of.

00:34:33.220 --> 00:34:34.520
It's like a bowling alley.

00:34:34.520 --> 00:34:37.910
One ball, one pin, one impact.

00:34:37.910 --> 00:34:39.030
Now the pin is in the air.

00:34:39.030 --> 00:34:40.490
What happens to the pin?

00:34:40.490 --> 00:34:41.540
It falls back down.

00:34:41.540 --> 00:34:41.870
Why?

00:34:41.870 --> 00:34:43.690
Because gravity pulls it down.

00:34:43.690 --> 00:34:47.030
In this case, you've got the
energetics pulling the

00:34:47.030 --> 00:34:48.170
electron back down.

00:34:48.170 --> 00:34:50.760
Now the electron goes from high
energy to low energy.

00:34:50.760 --> 00:34:54.380
And when that happens, the
energy difference is given off

00:34:54.380 --> 00:34:57.200
in the form of a photon.

00:34:57.200 --> 00:35:01.690
So I get photon emission when
this falls back down.

00:35:01.690 --> 00:35:05.730
And this photon has
a wavelength.

00:35:05.730 --> 00:35:09.820
What I'm going to show you is
that the set of lines that you

00:35:09.820 --> 00:35:14.860
get from exactly this
configuration using this

00:35:14.860 --> 00:35:19.100
equation give you the
Balmer series.

00:35:19.100 --> 00:35:23.710
So now you've got a model that
Bohr postulated for atomic

00:35:23.710 --> 00:35:28.460
hydrogen on 1-electron atom that
exactly predicts that set

00:35:28.460 --> 00:35:29.680
of 4 lines.

00:35:29.680 --> 00:35:33.670
Which were measured
50 years before.

00:35:33.670 --> 00:35:35.160
So let's go.

00:35:35.160 --> 00:35:38.520
So first of all let's
get the energy here.

00:35:38.520 --> 00:35:40.220
And I'm going to get the energy
of this electron.

00:35:40.220 --> 00:35:44.110
This electron I'm going to call
a ballistic electron.

00:35:44.110 --> 00:35:46.080
Why do I call it a ballistic
electron?

00:35:46.080 --> 00:35:47.580
Because it's not bound.

00:35:47.580 --> 00:35:48.240
It's free.

00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:51.790
It boils off the cathode, flies
through free space, and

00:35:51.790 --> 00:35:52.850
crashes into an anode.

00:35:52.850 --> 00:35:55.050
Clearly it's not part
of an atom.

00:35:55.050 --> 00:35:57.270
But there's a second electron
in this story.

00:35:57.270 --> 00:35:59.950
And it's the ground state
electron in hydrogen.

00:35:59.950 --> 00:36:01.200
And it lives here.

00:36:04.080 --> 00:36:06.070
So what's the energy of the
ballistic electron?

00:36:10.490 --> 00:36:14.750
Well that's just 1/2 mv squared
And where did it get

00:36:14.750 --> 00:36:15.640
its energy from?

00:36:15.640 --> 00:36:18.070
It got its energy from
the power supply.

00:36:18.070 --> 00:36:20.330
And what's the electrostatic
energy?

00:36:20.330 --> 00:36:24.200
It's the product of the charge
on the species times the

00:36:24.200 --> 00:36:27.270
voltage through which
it was accelerated.

00:36:27.270 --> 00:36:29.710
So away we go.

00:36:29.710 --> 00:36:32.190
I know the charge on the
electron is minus E.

00:36:32.190 --> 00:36:34.300
Whatever the voltage is
there, 1 volt, 10

00:36:34.300 --> 00:36:35.960
volts, 100 volts, whatever.

00:36:35.960 --> 00:36:37.560
Away we go.

00:36:37.560 --> 00:36:40.630
By the way, I'm going to show
you just one other thing in

00:36:40.630 --> 00:36:42.580
terms of order of magnitude.

00:36:42.580 --> 00:36:46.290
The kinds of voltages you see
along here are 1 volt, 10

00:36:46.290 --> 00:36:47.650
volts, that sort of thing.

00:36:47.650 --> 00:36:57.160
So suppose, to get an order of
magnitude, suppose we had a

00:36:57.160 --> 00:37:02.070
species of charge E.

00:37:02.070 --> 00:37:05.255
So in other words, it's only 1
times the elementary charge.

00:37:05.255 --> 00:37:14.370
A species of charge
E influenced by

00:37:14.370 --> 00:37:18.350
voltage of 1 volt.

00:37:18.350 --> 00:37:23.040
So this is 1 in the voltage
units, and 1 in the elementary

00:37:23.040 --> 00:37:24.000
charge units.

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:25.310
How much energy would that be?

00:37:25.310 --> 00:37:28.260
That's equivalent to making
1 volt and accelerate an

00:37:28.260 --> 00:37:33.110
electron from rest
across this gap.

00:37:33.110 --> 00:37:37.400
And the result would be, the
energy then would simply equal

00:37:37.400 --> 00:37:46.260
1.6 times 10 to the minus 19
coulombs times 1 volt.

00:37:46.260 --> 00:37:47.720
And what's the energy
going to be?

00:37:47.720 --> 00:37:49.330
Well I've got coulombs
times volts.

00:37:49.330 --> 00:37:51.550
And I don't know how I convert
one to the other.

00:37:51.550 --> 00:37:52.200
I don't have to.

00:37:52.200 --> 00:37:53.170
Why not?

00:37:53.170 --> 00:37:54.570
Because that's an SI unit.

00:37:54.570 --> 00:37:56.040
And that's an SI unit.

00:37:56.040 --> 00:37:57.110
This is an energy.

00:37:57.110 --> 00:37:59.576
So with impunity, I write
1.6 times 10 to

00:37:59.576 --> 00:38:01.400
the minus 19 joules.

00:38:01.400 --> 00:38:04.820
That's the beauty of SI units.

00:38:04.820 --> 00:38:05.820
So that's a good news.

00:38:05.820 --> 00:38:06.560
I know it's joules.

00:38:06.560 --> 00:38:08.640
The bad news is I hate
this number.

00:38:08.640 --> 00:38:10.850
It's a stupid number, 1.6 times
10 to the minus 19.

00:38:10.850 --> 00:38:11.450
it's crazy.

00:38:11.450 --> 00:38:14.920
Why don't I come up with
a number like 3, 7?

00:38:14.920 --> 00:38:17.440
So what I could do,
is I could define.

00:38:17.440 --> 00:38:21.070
I could define a unit such
that when the elementary

00:38:21.070 --> 00:38:26.300
charge is accelerated across the
unit voltage, I would call

00:38:26.300 --> 00:38:30.470
that unit 1 electron volt.

00:38:30.470 --> 00:38:32.650
And so somebody thought
of this before me.

00:38:32.650 --> 00:38:35.190
And hence, this is the unit
of the electron volt.

00:38:35.190 --> 00:38:38.790
It takes these crazy things that
we've been spewing here

00:38:38.790 --> 00:38:42.510
up until now, and rationalizes
them into numbers that people

00:38:42.510 --> 00:38:44.060
can carry around
in their heads.

00:38:44.060 --> 00:38:45.380
So what's K now?

00:38:45.380 --> 00:38:48.990
K is 2.18 times 10 to
the minus 18 joules.

00:38:48.990 --> 00:38:49.960
Yuck!

00:38:49.960 --> 00:38:51.700
Let's convert that to
electron volts.

00:38:51.700 --> 00:38:55.100
So I divide by 1.6 times
10 to the minus 19.

00:38:55.100 --> 00:38:58.600
And I got 13.6 electron volts.

00:38:58.600 --> 00:39:02.090
You'll remember that on your
death bed, ionization energy

00:39:02.090 --> 00:39:04.440
of atomic hydrogen.

00:39:04.440 --> 00:39:06.980
Maybe we don't have to give
out tables of constants.

00:39:06.980 --> 00:39:08.300
You just know this stuff.

00:39:08.300 --> 00:39:09.510
It's OK.

00:39:09.510 --> 00:39:10.430
All right.

00:39:10.430 --> 00:39:14.380
Now one last thing about this.

00:39:14.380 --> 00:39:16.380
So this has got gas in it.

00:39:16.380 --> 00:39:17.720
This is the cathode.

00:39:17.720 --> 00:39:23.270
And this beam of electrons, back
in the 1800s, there was a

00:39:23.270 --> 00:39:25.750
popular term, it was
called the ray.

00:39:25.750 --> 00:39:28.410
So instead of a beam of
light, people refer

00:39:28.410 --> 00:39:30.460
to the ray of light.

00:39:30.460 --> 00:39:33.700
So then when they got to
particle beams, they talk to

00:39:33.700 --> 00:39:35.210
them as rays.

00:39:35.210 --> 00:39:39.890
So this is now not an electron
beam, it's an electron ray.

00:39:39.890 --> 00:39:41.550
And it comes off the cathode.

00:39:41.550 --> 00:39:43.500
And it's in a vacuum tube.

00:39:43.500 --> 00:39:49.715
So this could be called a
cathode ray tube, a CRT.

00:39:49.715 --> 00:39:51.650
Now see, I could flatten this.

00:39:51.650 --> 00:39:53.450
And I could spray it
with phosphors.

00:39:53.450 --> 00:39:56.880
And then I could put some
charge plates here.

00:39:56.880 --> 00:39:58.670
The electrons have a
negative charge.

00:39:58.670 --> 00:40:01.440
So if I charge these plates, and
I was clever about how I

00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:04.490
charge them and varied the
charge, I could raster the

00:40:04.490 --> 00:40:07.920
electron beam like this about
30 times a second all up and

00:40:07.920 --> 00:40:08.850
down the screen.

00:40:08.850 --> 00:40:11.370
And then I could put some
program signal in there.

00:40:11.370 --> 00:40:12.430
And I could sit here.

00:40:12.430 --> 00:40:13.680
And I could watch TV.

00:40:17.630 --> 00:40:21.830
It all started with the
gas discharge tube.

00:40:21.830 --> 00:40:25.930
It says nothing about the
content unfortunately.

00:40:25.930 --> 00:40:28.660
Very nice physics,
but no content.

00:40:28.660 --> 00:40:29.030
All right.

00:40:29.030 --> 00:40:32.940
So now we've got the electron.

00:40:32.940 --> 00:40:35.060
The electron is moving, the
ballistic electron.

00:40:35.060 --> 00:40:36.690
Now I want to look at what
happens when the ballistic

00:40:36.690 --> 00:40:39.640
electron smashes into one of
those hydrogen atoms. So let's

00:40:39.640 --> 00:40:41.340
go back over here.

00:40:41.340 --> 00:40:44.330
So here's the incident
particle.

00:40:44.330 --> 00:40:47.250
And it's going to be an
electron in this case.

00:40:47.250 --> 00:40:48.900
So I'm going to designate
this electron.

00:40:48.900 --> 00:40:52.860
This is my ballistic electron.

00:40:52.860 --> 00:40:57.810
So here's the incident
electron.

00:40:57.810 --> 00:41:00.500
And this is ballistic,
just to be clear.

00:41:00.500 --> 00:41:02.800
It's the ballistic incident
electron.

00:41:02.800 --> 00:41:04.750
Now this is a mixed
metaphor here.

00:41:04.750 --> 00:41:08.390
Because I'm representing this
in Cartesian space.

00:41:08.390 --> 00:41:10.790
But I've moved into
energy space.

00:41:10.790 --> 00:41:12.360
So some people are going
to get really upset.

00:41:12.360 --> 00:41:13.430
Because they're going to say,
well this is Cartesian, but

00:41:13.430 --> 00:41:14.480
this isn't.

00:41:14.480 --> 00:41:15.615
It doesn't matter.

00:41:15.615 --> 00:41:17.060
It's my lecture.

00:41:17.060 --> 00:41:17.800
It's my model.

00:41:17.800 --> 00:41:19.050
It works.

00:41:21.180 --> 00:41:22.860
I'm the professor.

00:41:22.860 --> 00:41:24.700
So we've got this mixed
metaphor here.

00:41:24.700 --> 00:41:26.300
But anyways, it helps a lot.

00:41:26.300 --> 00:41:28.565
So what happens when this
thing comes in?

00:41:28.565 --> 00:41:32.610
It depends on how much
energy it has.

00:41:32.610 --> 00:41:38.680
Now if the incident energy,
if E incident is

00:41:38.680 --> 00:41:40.400
tiny, nothing happens.

00:41:40.400 --> 00:41:43.470
This thing just zooms
right on through.

00:41:43.470 --> 00:41:47.860
But if the incident energy, if
E of the incident ballistic

00:41:47.860 --> 00:41:52.830
electron is greater than
delta E for any

00:41:52.830 --> 00:41:54.900
transition that's feasible--

00:41:54.900 --> 00:41:57.470
and in this case I'm going to
assume I don't have thermal

00:41:57.470 --> 00:41:58.700
distribution of electrons.

00:41:58.700 --> 00:42:00.890
If I gave you Avogadro's number
of hydrogen atoms

00:42:00.890 --> 00:42:02.810
because of the thermal
distribution of energies-- and

00:42:02.810 --> 00:42:04.310
we'll come back to
this later--

00:42:04.310 --> 00:42:07.740
there might actually be, at
any moment, some electrons

00:42:07.740 --> 00:42:10.110
that are thermally excited
above the ground state.

00:42:10.110 --> 00:42:11.710
We're going to forget
about that for now.

00:42:11.710 --> 00:42:15.590
We're going to spiral up the
learning curve here.

00:42:15.590 --> 00:42:17.920
So first time we're going to
assume all the electrons are

00:42:17.920 --> 00:42:19.270
in the ground state.

00:42:19.270 --> 00:42:24.520
If I don't enough energy to go
from n equals 1 to n equals 2,

00:42:24.520 --> 00:42:25.330
nothing happens.

00:42:25.330 --> 00:42:27.760
If I have more than enough
energy to go for n equals 1 to

00:42:27.760 --> 00:42:30.200
n equals 2, I will
take that energy.

00:42:30.200 --> 00:42:33.530
And the electron will jump,
steal that amount of energy,

00:42:33.530 --> 00:42:36.010
and then this thing moves on--

00:42:36.010 --> 00:42:38.700
and I'm purposely making this
vector shorter than the

00:42:38.700 --> 00:42:39.800
incident vector--

00:42:39.800 --> 00:42:41.510
with that amount
of energy raw.

00:42:41.510 --> 00:42:43.820
And this is called the
scattered electron.

00:42:43.820 --> 00:42:45.590
Go back to the bowling
ball analogy.

00:42:45.590 --> 00:42:48.440
The bowling ball comes in with
a certain energy, hits the

00:42:48.440 --> 00:42:50.190
pin, continues to roll.

00:42:50.190 --> 00:42:53.420
But you know that there's a loss
of kinetic energy in the

00:42:53.420 --> 00:42:54.100
bowling ball.

00:42:54.100 --> 00:42:55.040
That's what we're seeing here.

00:42:55.040 --> 00:42:57.920
It's purely ballistic.

00:42:57.920 --> 00:43:00.680
Now let's say we do have more
than enough energy.

00:43:00.680 --> 00:43:04.620
Suppose I have enough energy to
go from n equals 1 halfway

00:43:04.620 --> 00:43:07.560
between n equals 2
and n equals 3.

00:43:07.560 --> 00:43:10.340
There's only n equals
1, n equals 2.

00:43:10.340 --> 00:43:14.850
I can't take the electron
up to n equals 2.3.

00:43:14.850 --> 00:43:15.630
It's unallowed.

00:43:15.630 --> 00:43:17.460
These are the only
allowed states.

00:43:17.460 --> 00:43:21.390
So that differential amount of
energy then resides with the

00:43:21.390 --> 00:43:23.380
electron that's ballistic.

00:43:23.380 --> 00:43:24.610
And it moves on here.

00:43:24.610 --> 00:43:26.690
So we've got conservation
of energy here.

00:43:26.690 --> 00:43:32.370
We can say that E incident will
then equal the energy

00:43:32.370 --> 00:43:36.570
that's lost in the transition
plus the energy that's still

00:43:36.570 --> 00:43:40.070
left with the scattered
electron.

00:43:40.070 --> 00:43:43.880
And we can calculate what that
transitional energy is.

00:43:43.880 --> 00:43:46.530
That transitional energy
is going to equal

00:43:46.530 --> 00:43:51.840
1/2 mv squared incident.

00:43:51.840 --> 00:43:55.160
This is the velocity, the
incident electron.

00:43:55.160 --> 00:43:58.670
What's the energy to go from
n equals 1 to n equals n?

00:43:58.670 --> 00:44:03.990
Whatever it is, its minus K
times Z squared If it's

00:44:03.990 --> 00:44:05.470
hydrogen, Z is 1.

00:44:05.470 --> 00:44:08.280
It's going to be 1 over nf.

00:44:08.280 --> 00:44:11.780
The final quantum number squared
minus 1 over the

00:44:11.780 --> 00:44:14.690
square of the initial
quantum number.

00:44:14.690 --> 00:44:17.860
And then, what's left over after
this has been robbed

00:44:17.860 --> 00:44:22.260
from the incident ballistic
energy is 1/2 mv squared of

00:44:22.260 --> 00:44:25.890
the scattered ballistic
electron.

00:44:25.890 --> 00:44:39.490
And the quantization dictates
that only if E incident is

00:44:39.490 --> 00:44:44.720
greater than delta E going 1
up to n-- here I'm assuming

00:44:44.720 --> 00:44:45.950
everything is in its
ground state.

00:44:45.950 --> 00:44:47.630
Later on we're going to
be more sophisticated.

00:44:47.630 --> 00:44:49.980
But for first time
through, all are

00:44:49.980 --> 00:44:50.830
ground state electrons.

00:44:50.830 --> 00:44:54.040
I have to have enough energy to
go at least to n equals 2.

00:44:54.040 --> 00:44:55.760
I can go to n equals
3, m equals 4.

00:44:55.760 --> 00:44:59.490
In principle, if this thing had
more than 13.6 electron

00:44:59.490 --> 00:45:01.320
volts, what would happen?

00:45:01.320 --> 00:45:03.060
It would kick this
electron out.

00:45:03.060 --> 00:45:04.350
Gone!

00:45:04.350 --> 00:45:08.110
And you'd have 2
free electrons.

00:45:08.110 --> 00:45:13.620
So if it's greater than this,
then the consequence is

00:45:13.620 --> 00:45:14.870
electron promotion.

00:45:19.850 --> 00:45:22.490
So we're moving along.

00:45:22.490 --> 00:45:24.890
But this excited state
is unstable.

00:45:24.890 --> 00:45:28.600
This excited state is unstable
because it's like the bowling

00:45:28.600 --> 00:45:29.450
pin that got thrown up.

00:45:29.450 --> 00:45:30.070
So what happens?

00:45:30.070 --> 00:45:32.460
The electron standing up there
on n equals 2, for example,

00:45:32.460 --> 00:45:34.310
looking down to n equals 1.

00:45:34.310 --> 00:45:35.080
And it falls.

00:45:35.080 --> 00:45:38.290
When it falls it gives
off radiation.

00:45:38.290 --> 00:45:41.170
And that radiation is
conservation of energy there.

00:45:41.170 --> 00:45:45.640
And what we know is when it
gives off an energy of the

00:45:45.640 --> 00:45:51.240
emitted photon, the energy of
the emitted photon must equal

00:45:51.240 --> 00:45:55.895
delta E of the transition
falling from 2 to 1.

00:45:55.895 --> 00:45:57.630
And we know how to
calculate that.

00:45:57.630 --> 00:45:59.890
That's just that thing
flipped around.

00:45:59.890 --> 00:46:02.290
And this thing is
equal to what?

00:46:02.290 --> 00:46:04.570
This is equal to h nu.

00:46:04.570 --> 00:46:08.700
According to Planck it's
hc over lambda is

00:46:08.700 --> 00:46:11.620
equal to hc nu bar.

00:46:11.620 --> 00:46:12.720
You know what this one is.

00:46:12.720 --> 00:46:18.070
This is minus KZ squared
1 over-- in this case

00:46:18.070 --> 00:46:19.200
it's going to be--

00:46:19.200 --> 00:46:23.700
1 over nf squared 1 over 1
squared minus 1 over, in this

00:46:23.700 --> 00:46:29.350
case, 1 over 2 squared And you
can generalize this 1 over nf.

00:46:29.350 --> 00:46:30.980
So where am I going with this?

00:46:30.980 --> 00:46:33.275
Well I'm going to flip
all of this around.

00:46:33.275 --> 00:46:36.780
And when I flip it all around,
what I'm going to end up with

00:46:36.780 --> 00:46:38.900
is this equation here.

00:46:38.900 --> 00:46:40.660
And better than that,
I'm going to end

00:46:40.660 --> 00:46:41.980
up with this equation.

00:46:41.980 --> 00:46:45.260
And I'm going to end up with
this as the constant.

00:46:45.260 --> 00:46:49.080
And when I get that, we're going
to say Bohr has done it.

00:46:49.080 --> 00:46:53.070
The data support the theory.

00:46:53.070 --> 00:46:55.920
So that's what we're
going to do.

00:46:55.920 --> 00:47:01.020
But I think we're going to
stop at this point today.

00:47:01.020 --> 00:47:03.900
So let me just jump here.

00:47:03.900 --> 00:47:06.660
I mentioned to you that if you
go here on your periodic

00:47:06.660 --> 00:47:09.120
table, there's the 13.6
electron volts.

00:47:09.120 --> 00:47:15.310
In the case of lithium, this
is 5.4 electron volts.

00:47:15.310 --> 00:47:17.330
So you can see all the
various values.

00:47:17.330 --> 00:47:19.720
This by the way, people
no noise.

00:47:19.720 --> 00:47:20.210
No noise.

00:47:20.210 --> 00:47:22.100
It's 11:52.

00:47:22.100 --> 00:47:24.190
I'm holding court until 11:55.

00:47:24.190 --> 00:47:26.360
I'm simply changing topics.

00:47:26.360 --> 00:47:28.060
It's not, oh this is
the part where I

00:47:28.060 --> 00:47:29.290
can talk to my neighbor.

00:47:29.290 --> 00:47:30.820
What are the rules?

00:47:30.820 --> 00:47:31.880
No talking.

00:47:31.880 --> 00:47:32.880
No food.

00:47:32.880 --> 00:47:37.160
No horseplay until 11:55.

00:47:37.160 --> 00:47:39.580
Then, still no horseplay,
gentle

00:47:39.580 --> 00:47:42.910
talking, no food, no drink.

00:47:42.910 --> 00:47:46.290
This is a sacred space.

00:47:46.290 --> 00:47:47.390
I'm not kidding you.

00:47:47.390 --> 00:47:48.490
Do you know why?

00:47:48.490 --> 00:47:53.400
In this secular America, this
is sacred space because this

00:47:53.400 --> 00:47:55.750
is where people learn.

00:47:55.750 --> 00:47:59.530
The lecture hall is
sacred space.

00:47:59.530 --> 00:48:03.020
Now, here's the 13.6
electron volts.

00:48:03.020 --> 00:48:05.430
And there's the 1.6 times 10
to the minus 19 joules.

00:48:05.430 --> 00:48:09.770
And if you multiply those 2,
you'll get the 2.18 over here.

00:48:09.770 --> 00:48:10.970
All right.

00:48:10.970 --> 00:48:13.760
Here's a cartoon showing the
photon, higher energy orbit,

00:48:13.760 --> 00:48:17.020
lower energy orbit, electron
emission transition, right out

00:48:17.020 --> 00:48:17.900
of your book.

00:48:17.900 --> 00:48:20.130
And there's a postulate 6.

00:48:20.130 --> 00:48:23.340
And we're going to finish this
up at the beginning of the

00:48:23.340 --> 00:48:24.410
Friday lecture.

00:48:24.410 --> 00:48:32.830
So here's the whole series from
n equals 3 to 2, n equals

00:48:32.830 --> 00:48:34.920
4 to 2, and so on.

00:48:34.920 --> 00:48:37.280
See how that works.

00:48:37.280 --> 00:48:38.530
OK.

00:48:41.310 --> 00:48:44.210
One of the things that we've
learned here, is that it

00:48:44.210 --> 00:48:47.730
doesn't matter what the incident
energy is here.

00:48:47.730 --> 00:48:51.360
The emission is characteristic
of the energy

00:48:51.360 --> 00:48:52.920
levels inside the gas.

00:48:55.680 --> 00:48:57.730
Instead of using an incident
electron, I could use an

00:48:57.730 --> 00:48:58.710
incident proton.

00:48:58.710 --> 00:49:01.260
I could use an incident
alpha particle.

00:49:01.260 --> 00:49:03.130
I could use an incident
neutron.

00:49:03.130 --> 00:49:06.020
Anything that has enough energy
to kick this up from n

00:49:06.020 --> 00:49:09.250
equals 1 to n equals 2 will
result in photon emission of

00:49:09.250 --> 00:49:10.320
this frequency.

00:49:10.320 --> 00:49:15.830
That means the set of those
lines is unique to the target.

00:49:15.830 --> 00:49:18.720
And this is the beginning
of chemical analysis.

00:49:18.720 --> 00:49:23.050
I can use this to characterize
species, to it, stars.

00:49:23.050 --> 00:49:25.960
How do we analyze the
composition a stars?

00:49:25.960 --> 00:49:29.550
Well, do we send a NASA
spaceship out 25 light-years

00:49:29.550 --> 00:49:32.390
and grab some gas and bring
it back to the lab?

00:49:32.390 --> 00:49:32.920
No.

00:49:32.920 --> 00:49:36.480
All we've got is the
spectrograph.

00:49:36.480 --> 00:49:37.620
The star is hot.

00:49:37.620 --> 00:49:43.120
That means thermal excitation
and cascading

00:49:43.120 --> 00:49:44.760
down with photon emission.

00:49:44.760 --> 00:49:48.760
And the lines we get are related
to the energy levels

00:49:48.760 --> 00:49:49.470
within the stars.

00:49:49.470 --> 00:49:52.220
So from a distance of a 100
light-years, I can tell you

00:49:52.220 --> 00:49:53.680
what the composition is.

00:49:53.680 --> 00:49:56.330
And if there's two gases
there, what if there's

00:49:56.330 --> 00:49:58.060
hydrogen and helium?

00:49:58.060 --> 00:49:59.650
the helium lines
will be there.

00:49:59.650 --> 00:50:02.410
And they'll be superimposed on
the hydrogen lines unless they

00:50:02.410 --> 00:50:04.380
lie directly on top
of one another.

00:50:04.380 --> 00:50:06.990
I'm going to be able to figure
out what's there.

00:50:06.990 --> 00:50:08.920
That's how it works.

00:50:08.920 --> 00:50:14.190
Now here's a story about an
astronomer, Cecilia Payne.

00:50:14.190 --> 00:50:15.830
She's the first woman
graduate student in

00:50:15.830 --> 00:50:17.116
astronomy at Harvard.

00:50:17.116 --> 00:50:20.900
She went on to chair the Faculty
of Arts and Sciences,

00:50:20.900 --> 00:50:24.480
awarded tenure, but denied a
professorship for 18 years

00:50:24.480 --> 00:50:26.150
because she was a woman.

00:50:26.150 --> 00:50:28.690
And in her thesis, she was the
first person to figure out to

00:50:28.690 --> 00:50:32.830
the sun is dominantly hydrogen,
not iron, which is

00:50:32.830 --> 00:50:34.270
what most astronomers thought.

00:50:34.270 --> 00:50:34.520
Why?

00:50:34.520 --> 00:50:37.110
Well, because the earth
is made of iron.

00:50:37.110 --> 00:50:39.180
Meteorites are made of iron.

00:50:39.180 --> 00:50:40.590
The whole universe must
be made of iron.

00:50:40.590 --> 00:50:42.300
Never mind the fact that
the sun is glowing.

00:50:45.310 --> 00:50:46.950
So here's how spectroscopy
works.

00:50:46.950 --> 00:50:47.700
Look at this.

00:50:47.700 --> 00:50:48.830
See, what does this mean?

00:50:48.830 --> 00:50:50.580
This is an analogy.

00:50:50.580 --> 00:50:51.490
What could that mean?

00:50:51.490 --> 00:50:52.700
Well, they said iron again.

00:50:52.700 --> 00:50:53.770
I know this is misspelled.

00:50:53.770 --> 00:50:56.610
But maybe it's just a glitch
in the instrumentation.

00:50:56.610 --> 00:50:58.600
So most people would look
at that and say,

00:50:58.600 --> 00:50:59.900
the message is iron.

00:50:59.900 --> 00:51:01.560
But it's not about the word.

00:51:01.560 --> 00:51:03.180
It's about the pattern.

00:51:03.180 --> 00:51:05.350
It's about the pattern.

00:51:05.350 --> 00:51:06.820
And that's what's
spectroscopy is.

00:51:06.820 --> 00:51:11.700
By the way, if you somehow
didn't catch this lecture.

00:51:11.700 --> 00:51:14.340
And you walked in, and all you
saw was those four lines.

00:51:14.340 --> 00:51:16.040
You know those four lines.

00:51:16.040 --> 00:51:18.390
That set of lines is
characteristic of atomic

00:51:18.390 --> 00:51:20.220
hydrogen, and nothing else.

00:51:20.220 --> 00:51:21.700
By the way, those lines
are very faint.

00:51:21.700 --> 00:51:23.220
This is not to scale.

00:51:23.220 --> 00:51:25.390
And they're so faint,
they're ghostlike.

00:51:25.390 --> 00:51:27.790
And what is the latin
word for ghost?

00:51:27.790 --> 00:51:28.820
Specter.

00:51:28.820 --> 00:51:30.260
So what is a spectrum?

00:51:30.260 --> 00:51:32.940
It is a set of ghostlike
lines.

00:51:32.940 --> 00:51:35.730
To this day, the term
spectroscopy refers to the

00:51:35.730 --> 00:51:40.540
ability to study data that are
so faint they're ghostlike.

00:51:40.540 --> 00:51:42.710
All right, we'll see
you on Friday.
