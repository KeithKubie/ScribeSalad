00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:02.440
Hey guys! Matt here for Science or Fiction.

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:06.340
Many countries have proposed developing giant
lasers to shoot at things in space.

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:11.000
No, this is not the plot of Austin Powers
4, these are real, honest-to-god plans hatched

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:12.750
up by a group of scientists.

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.210
The idea is that a massive laser would be
used to zap space junk into such tiny pieces

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:20.540
so that they will no longer pose a threat
to important spacecraft like the International

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:21.540
Space Station.

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:23.340
But, would that even work?

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.070
Are space lasers really a thing?

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:28.040
Well, first, you might be wondering, what
the heck is space junk?

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:29.900
There are actually a couple of types.

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.480
There’s natural and unnatural kinds.

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.800
The natural kind mostly refers to small meteors
that orbit the sun.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.620
The unnatural kind, also known as orbital
debris, includes any man-made object orbiting

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:44.640
the Earth that no longer serves a useful function.

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.159
This includes pieces of nonfunctional spacecraft,
old rockets, abandoned launch vehicle stations,

00:00:48.159 --> 00:00:51.420
retired satellites, some dude in a Telsa/car
etc.

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.440
Now, many space agencies are trying to develop
plans to deal with the debris because space

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.899
junk is becoming a huge problem for their
operations.

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:02.760
And this shouldn’t come as a big surprise
given that humans have been sending all sorts

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.300
of things up into the cosmos over the last
60 years.

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:11.150
There are over 20,000 pieces of space junk
larger than a softball currently orbiting

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:12.150
Earth.

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.410
There are well over 500,000 pieces of space
junk that are the same size as a marble or

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:20.330
larger, and millions upon millions of pieces
that are much smaller.

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:25.430
That said, even a super tiny piece of space
junk could inflict serious damage on an active

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:29.650
spacecraft, including the ISS, given that
most of these morsels are traveling up to

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:33.190
speeds of up to 17,500 mph.

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:36.860
NASA first started to consider the option
of a laser in 1996.

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:41.300
The space agency teamed up with the U.S. Air
Force on Project Orion, which suggested that

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:45.900
a powerful laser could be used to vaporize
surface material on space junk.

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:49.860
If vaporized enough, the idea was that the
objects would be taken out of orbit and come

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.610
hurtling back to Earth, where they would burn
up in the atmosphere.

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:56.680
This proposal never became a reality because
the laser would be so powerful that it could

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:01.380
also have been considered a weapon, which
wasn’t likely to sit well with other countries.

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.660
Since then, NASA has proposed using much less
powerful lasers to do a similar job.

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:11.030
In 2011, a team looked into using a system
that would operate using photon momentum.

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.850
Instead of one quick zap, this laser would
use a much weaker light that would concentrate

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:18.830
on one piece of junk for an hour or two over
the course of multiple days.

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:21.240
Still, this proposal has yet to become a reality.

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:25.030
There have also been proposals for magnets
that would be used to lure the pieces out

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:26.030
of orbit.

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:30.670
And (a group of) European engineers have recently
developed a net with a harpoon to test the

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:34.670
effectiveness of plucking debris out of orbit
and sending it into the atmosphere to burn.

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:39.530
But as lasers remain one of the more popular
ideas, many still fear that the deployment

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:42.319
of lasers could mean the militarization of
space.

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:46.340
Theoretically, a laser could also destroy
functioning satellites from other countries,

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.150
not only space debris.

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.880
There are strict international treaties in
place to prevent space militarization, which

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.570
makes plans like this one very controversial.

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:57.730
Whether or not space lasers ever become a
reality, the plan is feasible.

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:01.680
The U.S. and other countries definitely have
the technology to carry it out.

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:06.190
So while this laser scheme may seem like something
out of a Star Wars or James Bond movie, it’s

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:08.740
real, and it could start within our lifetimes.

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:13.120

Speaking of something out of a James Bond
movie, what happens when humans go really

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:17.599
fast?

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:20.280
Like, you know, how Bond does in those fancy
cars and jets.

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.180
Well, we talk about what G forces do to the
human body in this video here.
