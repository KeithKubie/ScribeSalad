00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:03.959
This month, many countries around the world will be spreading awareness on multiple

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:08.299
sclerosis, or "MS".  A disease that
affects millions of people worldwide.  But

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:12.500
what exactly is multiple sclerosis? MS primarily affects the central

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.359
nervous system which consists of the
brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.  Just

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:19.410
about everything you do depends on this
system functioning properly, from

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.230
breathing to moving and even watching
youtube videos.  And these actions are all

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:26.700
facilitated by neurons throughout your body,
cells which we've talked about many

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:30.330
times in our previous videos.  These
neurons are able to send signals all

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.320
throughout the body at incredible
speeds, in part because of the fatty

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:34.590
coating that surrounds them

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.030
something called myelin or the myelin sheath.

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:40.640
This myelin insulates the impulses and
allows the nerve signals to reach their

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.600
destination, however in the case of
MS this is where the issues occur.

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.649
The immune system is designed to fight
off disease from viruses, bacteria,

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:51.719
parasites or other agents and does so by
distinguishing these things from healthy

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.149
tissue.  But in the case of MS, the immune
system ends up attacking the myelin in

00:00:56.149 --> 00:00:59.140
what is classified as an auto-immune disorder.

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.310
This process of de-myelination can lead
to a build above scar tissue, hence the

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:07.660
word sclerosis.  The CNS then becomes
unable to send and receive signals

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:11.840
properly.  Messages traveling along
neurons may be slowed down, distorted or

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.760
stopped altogether.  Because of the
bearing, locations and nature of de-myelination,

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:19.090
the symptoms of MS are
incredibly diverse.  They can range from

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:23.500
muscle weakness to decreased coordination,
fatigue, vision problems, numbness or even

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:24.509
paralysis.

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.969
Though an MRI scan of the brain to
look for lesions or scarring is integral

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:29.210
to diagnosis.

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:32.730
For some, the symptoms come as acute
episodes while others experience more

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:36.990
chronic and permanent symptoms, which
worsen over time.  At this point no true

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.330
cause or cure is known.  While potential
links to environmental factors, viral

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:45.140
infections and genetics have been found,
studies are ongoing and not yet

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.360
conclusive.  And while their has been a lot of work
towards not only alleviating some of the

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.280
symptoms but slowing the progression,
sadly these treatments do not work for

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.080
all MS sufferers. Ultimately, bringing
like to this issue in an effort to

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:00.410
support and fund research is an
incredibly important step to erasing MS.

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:03.940
And though many of us will
never truly understand the challenges of

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:05.020
living with MS,

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.380
we can work together to raise awareness.
We would be so grateful if you could

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:11.600
take a moment and pass this video on to
your family and friends and join in the

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.949
effort to end MS.
