00:00:00.318 --> 00:00:02.151
- We've already seen that an enzyme helps

00:00:02.151 --> 00:00:05.285
catalyze a reaction, so let's
say this right over here,

00:00:05.285 --> 00:00:10.285
this is our enzyme, and
we have our substrate,

00:00:10.485 --> 00:00:13.885
and it goes and it binds
to the active site,

00:00:13.885 --> 00:00:15.718
to the active site of the enzyme,

00:00:15.718 --> 00:00:18.685
so let's say it binds right over there

00:00:18.685 --> 00:00:21.251
on the enzyme we call it the active site

00:00:21.251 --> 00:00:23.918
where the substrate binds
and then the enzyme catalyzes

00:00:23.918 --> 00:00:26.085
a reaction; maybe it
breaks up this substrate

00:00:26.085 --> 00:00:27.995
into two smaller molecules.

00:00:27.995 --> 00:00:32.605
And so after the reaction,

00:00:32.605 --> 00:00:34.925
the enzyme, whoops.

00:00:34.925 --> 00:00:39.718
After the reaction, the
enzyme is unchanged,

00:00:39.718 --> 00:00:42.818
but a reaction has been catalyzed.

00:00:44.628 --> 00:00:48.052
We now have the substrate being broken up,

00:00:48.052 --> 00:00:50.617
in this case at least,
into two smaller molecules.

00:00:50.617 --> 00:00:52.718
Maybe I'll draw them. That's one of them.

00:00:52.718 --> 00:00:55.085
And this is the other one right over here.

00:00:55.085 --> 00:00:58.251
So they just came from the active site.

00:00:58.251 --> 00:01:01.085
Once the reaction is
catalyzed, they don't have

00:01:01.085 --> 00:01:03.851
the affinity to the active site
anymore and they break off.

00:01:03.851 --> 00:01:06.747
So this enzyme has just
catalyzed this reaction.

00:01:06.747 --> 00:01:08.068
What I wanna talk about in this video

00:01:08.068 --> 00:01:11.051
is how this might be
inhibited, and specifically

00:01:11.051 --> 00:01:13.350
how it might be inhibited competitively.

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.685
So we're gonna talk about
competitive inhibition.

00:01:16.685 --> 00:01:18.785
So competitive--

00:01:18.785 --> 00:01:19.918
Let me write it over here.

00:01:19.918 --> 00:01:24.284
Competitive

00:01:24.284 --> 00:01:26.084
inhibition.

00:01:26.084 --> 00:01:28.284
Inhibition.

00:01:28.284 --> 00:01:31.285
So the classic case of
competitive inhibition:

00:01:31.285 --> 00:01:35.618
if there's some molecule that competes

00:01:35.618 --> 00:01:38.584
for the substrate at the active site,

00:01:38.584 --> 00:01:39.884
as we'll see this isn't the only form

00:01:39.884 --> 00:01:42.151
of competitive inhibition,
but this is the one

00:01:42.151 --> 00:01:44.651
that you will most
typically see in a textbook.

00:01:44.651 --> 00:01:48.352
So that's our enzyme again.

00:01:49.452 --> 00:01:51.251
So that's our enzyme.

00:01:51.251 --> 00:01:53.684
And we've already seen that
this is right over here

00:01:53.684 --> 00:01:56.718
where I'm circling,
that is the active site.

00:01:56.718 --> 00:02:01.718
Active site.

00:02:01.851 --> 00:02:05.318
And if the molecule,
the intended substrate

00:02:05.318 --> 00:02:07.418
I guess you could say, gets
to it and we're gonna have

00:02:07.418 --> 00:02:09.284
this first scenario up here.

00:02:09.284 --> 00:02:11.351
But in classic competitive inhibition,

00:02:11.351 --> 00:02:13.818
or at least the version I'm
just gonna show you right now,

00:02:13.818 --> 00:02:17.060
you could have another molecule

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.351
that let's say it looks
something like this

00:02:19.351 --> 00:02:21.784
that can compete for the active site

00:02:21.784 --> 00:02:26.118
and if it gets to the active site first,

00:02:26.118 --> 00:02:27.685
so if it gets there first,

00:02:27.685 --> 00:02:30.218
let me show what's going to happen,

00:02:30.218 --> 00:02:33.185
so then we have our enzyme,

00:02:33.185 --> 00:02:38.151
we have the other molecule,
not the intended substrate

00:02:38.151 --> 00:02:40.250
binds to the active site first.

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.651
Well now the intended substrate,

00:02:42.651 --> 00:02:45.850
the one for which the enzyme
catalyzed the reaction,

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:49.918
isn't able to bind and the
reaction isn't going to happen.

00:02:49.918 --> 00:02:51.785
And you can see very clearly
that they are competing

00:02:51.785 --> 00:02:53.417
for the enzyme, and in this case,

00:02:53.417 --> 00:02:55.652
they're competing for the active site.

00:02:55.652 --> 00:02:58.517
Now this isn't the only form
of competitive inhibition.

00:02:58.517 --> 00:03:00.485
Another form of competitive inhibition

00:03:00.485 --> 00:03:03.485
is allosteric competitive inhibition.

00:03:03.485 --> 00:03:04.984
Let me write this down.

00:03:04.984 --> 00:03:08.052
So you have allosteric.

00:03:08.052 --> 00:03:10.495
Allosteric

00:03:10.495 --> 00:03:14.635
competitive

00:03:14.635 --> 00:03:17.705
inhibition.

00:03:17.705 --> 00:03:19.018
Now I'm having trouble writing.

00:03:19.018 --> 00:03:21.118
Inhibition.

00:03:21.118 --> 00:03:25.284
And an allosteric site is a
site other than the active site.

00:03:25.284 --> 00:03:28.518
But in allosteric competitive inhibition

00:03:28.518 --> 00:03:30.184
or competitive allosteric inhibition,

00:03:30.184 --> 00:03:32.951
however you wanna say
it, you have a scenario

00:03:32.951 --> 00:03:37.117
where the competitor doesn't
bind to the active site

00:03:37.117 --> 00:03:39.151
but binds to a site that
is not the active site,

00:03:39.151 --> 00:03:41.051
an allosteric site you could say.

00:03:41.051 --> 00:03:44.718
So in that one, the competitor,
maybe might bind here,

00:03:44.718 --> 00:03:46.584
so that's clearly not the active site.

00:03:46.584 --> 00:03:49.018
So maybe the competitor
looks something like that.

00:03:49.018 --> 00:03:51.817
It didn't bind to the active site,

00:03:51.817 --> 00:03:56.817
but by binding there, the
active site can no longer bind

00:03:57.217 --> 00:04:01.650
to the intended substrate,
so you have the same effect.

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:04.052
You have the same effect right over here

00:04:04.052 --> 00:04:07.317
where this thing isn't going to bind.

00:04:07.317 --> 00:04:09.417
But if this thing binds first...

00:04:09.417 --> 00:04:11.618
So let me draw that scenario.

00:04:11.618 --> 00:04:15.317
So if the intended substrate binds first,

00:04:15.317 --> 00:04:17.652
then the competitor can't bind.

00:04:17.652 --> 00:04:20.518
So in this scenario, if
the substrate is able

00:04:20.518 --> 00:04:22.485
to get to the active site,

00:04:22.485 --> 00:04:24.385
well then the competitor can't bind,

00:04:24.385 --> 00:04:25.584
so once again, they're competing.

00:04:25.584 --> 00:04:27.752
So I'll draw the competitor up here.

00:04:27.752 --> 00:04:29.552
So then the competitor,

00:04:29.552 --> 00:04:31.851
whoever gets to it first gets the enzyme.

00:04:31.851 --> 00:04:33.784
So in this situation, the
competitor's not going to bind.

00:04:33.784 --> 00:04:35.485
So that's true of whether
you're talking about

00:04:35.485 --> 00:04:37.317
competitive inhibition
where they're competing

00:04:37.317 --> 00:04:39.851
for the active site, if the
competitor gets there first,

00:04:39.851 --> 00:04:42.831
the intended substrate
isn't gonna get there,

00:04:42.831 --> 00:04:45.864
the reaction isn't going to be catalyzed.

00:04:45.864 --> 00:04:48.751
Or if the intended substrate gets first,

00:04:48.751 --> 00:04:51.151
then the competitor's not
going to be able to get there.

00:04:51.151 --> 00:04:52.551
In fact it could have been this situation

00:04:52.551 --> 00:04:56.285
where because the
substrate got there first,

00:04:56.285 --> 00:05:01.285
the competitor isn't
going to be able to bind

00:05:01.618 --> 00:05:03.052
to the active site.

00:05:03.052 --> 00:05:05.451
When we're talking about
allosteric competitive inhibition,

00:05:05.451 --> 00:05:07.118
we're still competing for the enzyme.

00:05:07.118 --> 00:05:08.885
Only one's gonna get it.

00:05:08.885 --> 00:05:10.551
If one gets to the enzyme first,

00:05:10.551 --> 00:05:12.351
then the other one's not
going to be able to get there.

00:05:12.351 --> 00:05:15.484
They are competing for the
enzyme, but the competitor,

00:05:15.484 --> 00:05:18.451
the non-substrate, is just
acting at an allosteric site.

00:05:18.451 --> 00:05:20.350
By binding to an allosteric site,

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:23.084
it changes the conformation of the enzyme

00:05:23.084 --> 00:05:26.952
so that the active site no
longer binds to the substrate.

00:05:26.952 --> 00:05:28.651
And I wanna really emphasize this point

00:05:28.651 --> 00:05:30.152
because when I first learned this, I said:

00:05:30.152 --> 00:05:31.351
"Oh!"

00:05:31.351 --> 00:05:33.185
And it's often sometimes
confusing, even some things

00:05:33.185 --> 00:05:36.067
you'll read on the
Internet, that they'll say

00:05:36.067 --> 00:05:39.051
that this allosteric type of
inhibition, they'll call this

00:05:39.051 --> 00:05:40.818
non-competitive 'cause
you're not competing

00:05:40.818 --> 00:05:44.718
for the active site, but that
is actually not the case.

00:05:44.718 --> 00:05:46.818
In non-competitive
inhibition, and I'm gonna do

00:05:46.818 --> 00:05:50.051
the whole next video on
non-competitive inhibition,

00:05:50.051 --> 00:05:54.785
in non-competitive inhibition,
the inhibitor right over here

00:05:54.785 --> 00:05:58.351
can bind regardless of
whether the substrate

00:05:58.351 --> 00:06:01.785
has bound or not, but when
the inhibitor does bind,

00:06:01.785 --> 00:06:04.051
it prevents the reaction
from moving forward,

00:06:04.051 --> 00:06:06.684
it changes the conformation of the protein

00:06:06.684 --> 00:06:09.118
so it no longer catalyzes the reaction.

00:06:09.118 --> 00:06:11.684
So non-competitive, they both can bind,

00:06:11.684 --> 00:06:12.985
but if the inhibitor is there,

00:06:12.985 --> 00:06:15.084
the reaction isn't going to proceed.

00:06:15.084 --> 00:06:16.850
In competitive inhibition,
whether we're talking about

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:20.252
allosteric or non-allosteric
competitive inhibition,

00:06:20.252 --> 00:06:24.084
only one of the substrate or the inhibitor

00:06:24.084 --> 00:06:25.918
is going to be able to bind.

00:06:25.918 --> 00:06:29.200
They are competing for the enzyme.
