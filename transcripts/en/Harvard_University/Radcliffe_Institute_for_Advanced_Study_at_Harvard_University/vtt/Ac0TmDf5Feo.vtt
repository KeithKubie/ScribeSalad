00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:06.720
- Good morning, everyone.

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:07.930
Delighted to have you here.

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:08.680
I'm Liz Cohen.

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:11.110
I'm Dean of the Radcliffe
institute for Advanced Study.

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:13.930
And I couldn't be more
pleased to welcome you

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:17.650
to the Linda N. Cabot
Science Symposium entitled,

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:21.590
"From Sea to Changing Sea--
a Science Symposium About

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:22.700
Oceans."

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:26.020
I'm especially pleased to see
so many members of the Radcliffe

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:29.910
Institute's Dean's Advisory
Council here today.

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.490
I thank them, along with
our Radcliffe associates,

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:36.940
and many other faithful friends
of the Radcliffe Institute,

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:40.560
for your support
for all that we do.

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.070
At the Radcliffe Institute
for Advanced Study,

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:45.340
scholars, scientists,
and artists

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:49.650
work at the forefront of their
field and across disciplines.

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:52.960
We are dedicated to
fostering and sharing

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.520
innovative work with the
public in all subjects.

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.980
But we are especially proud
of our strong tradition

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:03.720
in the sciences, a tradition
that manifests itself

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:07.210
in this annual science symposium
and in the related lecture

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:10.930
series that runs throughout
the academic year.

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:15.330
Science flourishes at Radcliffe
because of the many ways

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.000
it intersects with
other disciplines.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.140
And we will certainly see
those intersections on display

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.450
here today at our
science symposium.

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.800
We are very grateful for the
generosity of Linda Cabot

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:31.250
and her husband, Ed Anderson,
for their support of today's

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:35.460
symposium, and also for the way
that they embody the Radcliffe

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.360
mission.

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:41.720
Linda Cabot, Class of 1980,
is the founder and president

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.570
of an educational
organization dedicated

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:48.850
to inspiring the next
generation of ocean caretakers.

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:52.740
She is also a visual artist
and a lifelong sailor,

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.730
who brings both of
these perspectives

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:58.880
to her love of the ocean,
just as we here at Radcliffe

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.080
bring a multi-disciplinary
approach

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.790
to many urgent subjects.

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:08.880
It is hard to imagine a more
urgent subject than oceans.

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.730
They cover three-quarters
of our planet,

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:16.320
and supply 50% of the
oxygen we breathe.

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:19.570
As Secretary of State
John Kerry said last month

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:22.970
at a conference on the ocean
hosted by the State Department,

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:26.260
and I quote him, "Our
ocean is absolutely

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.630
essential for life itself.

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:31.330
Not just the food, but
the oxygen and weather

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:36.060
cycles of the planet
all depend on the ocean.

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.180
Throughout the world, the
sea sculpts the shorelines

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.400
of our continents, and
influences the changing

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:43.430
climate."

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:49.000
Here in New England, the ocean
is especially inescapable.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.760
The coastline is literally
right at our doorstep.

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:58.070
So concerns about rising sea
levels hit very close to home.

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:01.340
Scientists predict that
sea levels in Boston

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.490
could rise anywhere
from two to six feet

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:06.630
by the end of the century.

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:10.490
Our doorsteps, in other words,
are the very ones the rising

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:13.060
seas are going to flood.

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:17.070
But the ocean shapes far
more than our landscape here

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:18.200
in New England.

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:22.360
It undergirds our economy,
shapes our culture.

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:24.540
It inspires our urban planning.

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:28.040
It influences public
health, and much more.

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:32.440
So when we say that the ocean
has an impact on climate

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:37.070
change, we mean the economic
and cultural climates as well as

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:38.380
the natural one.

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:40.820
Let me give you some examples.

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:44.980
Cod was once so plentiful
off the coast of New England

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:49.140
that fisherman joked that they
could walk across the Atlantic

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:51.480
on the backs of this
ubiquitous fish,

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:54.100
and never get their feet wet.

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:57.420
Now cod populations
have collapsed,

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:01.300
partly because of overfishing,
but also because of the rising

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:04.900
temperatures of New
England's coastal waters.

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:09.200
In fact, the cod catch
has declined by fully 90%

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:11.370
over the past three decades.

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:15.770
One of our speakers today will
address this critical question.

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:18.200
At the same time,
warmer waters have

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:22.930
led to increases in stocks of
shellfish, including lobster.

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:26.550
More lobster might
sound like good news,

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:30.430
until we realize that the
sudden increase in supply

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:33.250
can make wholesale
prices plummet.

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:37.440
In 2012, the price paid
to lobstering crews

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:42.150
fell to $2 per pound, compared
to the more typical rate

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:43.830
of $4 per pound.

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:47.190
And it caused real
economic hardship.

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:49.990
One specific place where
shifts in the ocean

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:53.730
have ripple effects on the
local economy and culture

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:56.910
is the town of Chatham
on Cape Cod, site

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:59.220
of the Monomoy Wildlife Refuge.

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:01.900
Tides, storms, and
rising sea levels

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:04.990
have redrawn the
boundaries of the Refuge.

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:09.090
US Fish and Wildlife Service
has responded with a wildlife

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:12.690
management plan that
Chatham town officials

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:15.770
and Massachusetts attorney
general Maura Healy

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:18.840
say will threaten
the fishing economy.

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:22.340
Meanwhile, after generations
of careful stewardship,

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:25.570
fishing families perceive
the outside restrictions

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:28.360
as an attack on local identity.

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:31.880
In short, oceans shape
our world and our lives

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:33.750
in very real ways.

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:35.890
If we want to
understand the ocean,

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:39.130
then we need to look at it from
many different perspectives,

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:42.420
which is exactly what we
are going to do here today.

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:45.030
Scholars and experts
on subjects ranging

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:48.420
from evolutionary
biology to oceanography

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:51.950
will be sharing the stage with
public officials, a Coast Guard

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:54.560
officer, and a law professor.

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:56.140
Today's conference
has been argued

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:59.570
organized by John Huth, the
Donner Professor of Science

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:02.880
at Harvard, and Faculty Director
for the Physical Sciences

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:04.690
at the Radcliffe Institute.

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:08.710
I want to thank John
for putting together

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:11.480
such a probing and
fascinating day for us.

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:14.570
He is the ideal leader
for a Radcliffe conference

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:18.340
about oceans, because so
many of John's professional

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:21.550
and personal interests
have to do with the water.

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:23.740
He is a physicist
who has written

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:27.620
about the science of navigation
from the shores of New England

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:29.300
to the Marshall Islands.

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:33.600
And he is an expert kayaker,
who is as comfortable in a boat

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:35.660
as he is in a computer lab.

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:38.746
So please join me now
in welcoming John Huth.

00:06:38.746 --> 00:06:43.990
[APPLAUSE]

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:45.080
- Thanks, Liz.

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:47.580
So welcome to everybody,
and good morning.

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:49.590
I think we have an
exciting program that

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:53.540
will be very informative,
and you'll enjoy it.

00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:56.150
So let me just frame
my own interest,

00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:58.530
and how I came to set this up.

00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:03.140
As part of my explorations
of how people navigate,

00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:07.580
I went to the Marshall
Islands, and went on a voyage

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:10.580
with an outrigger canoe
between two of the atolls.

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:13.440
And we ended up on the
island of Tabal, which

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:16.320
is on the remote atoll of Aur.

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:21.680
And there, we were greeted with
flower garlands and a feast,

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:25.620
where we had all of these fish,
and breadfruit, and lobsters,

00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:26.710
and crabs.

00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:30.340
And we were welcomed
with open arms.

00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:34.330
In a sense the people who we
were coming with and visiting

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:36.410
were trying to revive the
culture in the Marshall

00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:40.720
Islands, which is under a
tremendous amount of stress,

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:44.870
both from colonial powers,
but also from the encroaching

00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:46.930
oceans as the sea levels rise.

00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:50.330
And what might have been
an abstract thought prior

00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:53.620
to my visit there
became quite visceral--

00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:56.160
how their lives were
inextricably linked

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:57.620
with the oceans.

00:07:57.620 --> 00:07:59.300
And this hit home.

00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:03.360
And what I realized when
I got back to the States

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:07.540
was that we, indeed-- our
fates are inextricably linked

00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:10.300
to the oceans, and we
come from the oceans.

00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:13.230
And we also put a lot
of stress on the oceans.

00:08:13.230 --> 00:08:16.330
So as part of the
Radcliffe duties,

00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:18.670
I suppose-- I'd hardly
call them duties anymore,

00:08:18.670 --> 00:08:22.100
because it's so enjoyable to
work here-- I put together

00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:24.780
this Science Symposium on
Oceans, which gave me something

00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:27.650
of a hunting license to
explore a set of topics

00:08:27.650 --> 00:08:30.580
that I found to be at
the frontiers of science,

00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:32.240
but also fascinating.

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:35.490
And in trying to find
these speakers that you'll

00:08:35.490 --> 00:08:40.390
hear today, I realized
how incredibly complex

00:08:40.390 --> 00:08:43.480
the oceans are, and
the diversity of things

00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:44.680
you find in the oceans.

00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:46.030
It's just unbelievable.

00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:49.690
So I'm grateful for the
speakers that we have today,

00:08:49.690 --> 00:08:51.540
and I welcome you.

00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:56.100
I also want to thank Linda
Cabot for supporting us in this.

00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:58.470
She's done a fantastic
job and provided me

00:08:58.470 --> 00:09:01.700
with a lot of insight, too,
in conservation of the oceans.

00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:03.260
So I'm grateful for that.

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:06.350
So let me invite our
first panel today.

00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:09.170
It's going to talk about early
life, and interesting life

00:09:09.170 --> 00:09:09.760
in the ocean.

00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:13.581
So we have Chris,
Peter, and David coming.

00:09:13.581 --> 00:09:15.330
You can take your seats
now, and I'll just

00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:17.950
say a few introductory words.

00:09:17.950 --> 00:09:21.160
So to frame this
a little bit, we

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:25.280
had a recent talk on the
search for life on exoplanets.

00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:29.190
And the speaker talked about
looking for signatures of life

00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:32.080
that more or less are kind
of our conventional ideas

00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:37.560
of what life might be like--
carbon-emitting creatures

00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:39.550
and certain ratios of
gases that we would see.

00:09:39.550 --> 00:09:43.520
But it was very much tied to
a conventional view of life

00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:44.190
as we know it.

00:09:44.190 --> 00:09:45.689
And people were
asking the question,

00:09:45.689 --> 00:09:47.130
what about other forms of life?

00:09:47.130 --> 00:09:48.921
And the speaker said,
well, we can't really

00:09:48.921 --> 00:09:52.060
imagine other forms of life
than the conventional sorts

00:09:52.060 --> 00:09:53.220
of things.

00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:55.980
And it's difficult to imagine
what the origins of life

00:09:55.980 --> 00:10:00.440
might have been in an
earlier epoch in our planet.

00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:02.300
But then you start to
scratch the surface,

00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:05.010
and you look at people that
study different forms of life.

00:10:05.010 --> 00:10:07.740
And you realize that there are
some amazing forms of life that

00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:10.070
don't really conform to
our normal visions of what

00:10:10.070 --> 00:10:11.610
they might be in the oceans.

00:10:11.610 --> 00:10:14.200
And so what I tried to do
was assemble some speakers

00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:15.920
that could talk to that.

00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:18.180
So with little
further ado, I'm going

00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:21.330
to introduce Chris
Bowler, who we're

00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:23.750
grateful to have as a Radcliffe
Fellow here this year,

00:10:23.750 --> 00:10:27.230
who just kind of spoke up at
one of our initial meetings.

00:10:27.230 --> 00:10:30.460
And immediately, I was
able to start digging

00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:31.470
up some information.

00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:33.090
And the wheels started turning.

00:10:33.090 --> 00:10:40.650
He is a director of the
CRNS Institute for Biology,

00:10:40.650 --> 00:10:44.900
and Professor at L'Ecole
Superieure in Paris,

00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:50.477
and works on phytoplanktons,
and amazing to talk to.

00:10:50.477 --> 00:10:52.588
Chris.

00:10:52.588 --> 00:10:55.432
[APPLAUSE]

00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:01.150
- Great, well, thank you, John.

00:11:01.150 --> 00:11:03.180
It's great to be here.

00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:07.330
Yes, as John mentioned, I'm
based in Paris, normally.

00:11:07.330 --> 00:11:11.050
But I'm on sabbatical here
at the Radcliffe Institute

00:11:11.050 --> 00:11:12.440
as a fellow for this year.

00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:17.480
And it's a wonderful
opportunity to meet many people,

00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:21.470
and to explore new avenues
of research, and so on.

00:11:21.470 --> 00:11:27.480
And it's great to see,
also, that the ocean is

00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:32.970
receiving so much interest in
the US, as it is in Europe.

00:11:32.970 --> 00:11:35.260
We've had a lot of talks,
a lot of discussions,

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:37.770
about the importance of
the ocean, a lot of concern

00:11:37.770 --> 00:11:40.180
about the ocean in
Europe, and it's

00:11:40.180 --> 00:11:45.010
great to see the same sort of
concern over here in the USA,

00:11:45.010 --> 00:11:46.740
too.

00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:51.920
So without further ado, I'll
introduce the first session,

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:54.330
which is entitled, "Early
Life in the Oceans,"

00:11:54.330 --> 00:11:57.670
which is a really
important topic,

00:11:57.670 --> 00:12:02.520
obviously, because everything
that is in the ocean to date

00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:04.970
came from this early
life in the ocean.

00:12:04.970 --> 00:12:07.290
In fact, everything--
all life on Earth--

00:12:07.290 --> 00:12:12.560
evolved from the ocean three and
a half billion or so years ago.

00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:16.070
So we're all evolved from
these little organisms

00:12:16.070 --> 00:12:21.270
which started the process
of life on this planet.

00:12:21.270 --> 00:12:23.470
So it's a fascinating topic.

00:12:23.470 --> 00:12:25.480
We've got two great
speakers here,

00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:28.090
who will introduce their
research on the topic.

00:12:28.090 --> 00:12:29.590
We'll have two
talks, and then we'll

00:12:29.590 --> 00:12:32.640
have a discussion time
with questions and answers,

00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:33.190
and so on.

00:12:33.190 --> 00:12:36.740
So please save your
questions until the end.

00:12:36.740 --> 00:12:41.250
And so the first speaker
is David Emerson,

00:12:41.250 --> 00:12:44.690
who is Senior Research
Scientist and Associate

00:12:44.690 --> 00:12:50.160
Director for Bacteriology in
the Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:54.320
Sciences, which is a very, very
well-known institute worldwide,

00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:57.090
and also has a very,
very important culture

00:12:57.090 --> 00:13:01.800
collection of microorganisms
from the ocean.

00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:04.900
That is a very, very important
resource for scientists

00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:06.590
throughout the world.

00:13:06.590 --> 00:13:09.240
So thank you for being
part of this institute,

00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:11.060
and for the work you do.

00:13:11.060 --> 00:13:14.286
And I'll hand it over to you.

00:13:14.286 --> 00:13:19.252
[APPLAUSE]

00:13:19.252 --> 00:13:21.710
- Thanks very much, Chris, for
that very nice introduction.

00:13:21.710 --> 00:13:24.990
It's really terrific to
be here, to be leading off

00:13:24.990 --> 00:13:26.100
this symposium.

00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:29.590
I'm really excited to have
the opportunity to do this.

00:13:29.590 --> 00:13:31.210
We had a wonderful
dinner last night

00:13:31.210 --> 00:13:33.030
at Dean Cohen's residence.

00:13:33.030 --> 00:13:37.130
It was really amazing to
learn about the Radcliffe

00:13:37.130 --> 00:13:40.510
Institution, and appreciate
everything they do,

00:13:40.510 --> 00:13:45.330
and especially Linda Cabot
for supporting this symposium.

00:13:45.330 --> 00:13:47.750
So I'm going to
jump right in here.

00:13:47.750 --> 00:13:50.490
I have 20 minutes to talk
about three billion years

00:13:50.490 --> 00:13:51.660
worth of Earth history.

00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:56.790
So I think the reason
that rust features

00:13:56.790 --> 00:14:00.770
prominently in my title will
become apparent during my talk.

00:14:00.770 --> 00:14:02.990
But I want to emphasize
my talk will be entirely

00:14:02.990 --> 00:14:05.060
about the Earth's ocean.

00:14:05.060 --> 00:14:08.000
But for that reason, I actually
put in my opening slide

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.200
here a picture of Venus
on the left and Mars

00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:14.860
on the right, as the
two other rocky planets

00:14:14.860 --> 00:14:18.730
that we share what's referred
to as the "habitable zone"

00:14:18.730 --> 00:14:21.270
in our Solar System-- that
zone in the Solar System

00:14:21.270 --> 00:14:22.900
where life could
exist, because there

00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:25.490
could be liquid water on
the surface of the planet.

00:14:25.490 --> 00:14:28.450
Venus very clearly does not have
liquid water on its surface.

00:14:28.450 --> 00:14:31.900
It's got a 95% CO2 atmosphere,
a runaway greenhouse,

00:14:31.900 --> 00:14:36.100
very much too hot on the surface
of Venus to support an ocean.

00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:39.200
Mars, we believe probably
did have an ocean

00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:42.790
several billion years ago,
but it lost its atmosphere

00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:44.940
at some point, and
now, it's much too cold

00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:48.310
to sustain liquid
water on the surface.

00:14:48.310 --> 00:14:51.480
So just to go into a bit
of Earth history here,

00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:53.260
I'll start with
this first slide,

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:55.821
which shows the Hadean Period.

00:14:55.821 --> 00:14:58.070
So we're going to start at
the formation of the Earth,

00:14:58.070 --> 00:15:02.980
sometime between 4.5 and
4.6 billion years ago.

00:15:02.980 --> 00:15:04.700
This is an artist's
rendition of what

00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:08.770
times would have been like
that-- very violent, very hot,

00:15:08.770 --> 00:15:12.390
asteroids, meteorites hitting
the planet repeatedly.

00:15:12.390 --> 00:15:14.530
The Moon broke off from
the Earth at this time,

00:15:14.530 --> 00:15:15.376
it's thought.

00:15:15.376 --> 00:15:17.500
There would have been times
when the entire surface

00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:21.710
of the planet was
essentially magma pools,

00:15:21.710 --> 00:15:26.830
and again, could not have
sustained a liquid water ocean.

00:15:26.830 --> 00:15:31.210
But then, there this
period came to an end

00:15:31.210 --> 00:15:33.330
somewhere around four
billion years ago.

00:15:33.330 --> 00:15:34.980
And we came to
what we have today,

00:15:34.980 --> 00:15:37.140
what we call the Blue Planet.

00:15:37.140 --> 00:15:40.770
And this is a picture from
space, obviously, done by NASA.

00:15:40.770 --> 00:15:45.070
And I chose this image because
it shows the Pacific Ocean,

00:15:45.070 --> 00:15:45.670
primarily.

00:15:45.670 --> 00:15:47.100
You don't see many land masses.

00:15:47.100 --> 00:15:48.550
Antarctica is at
the bottom there.

00:15:48.550 --> 00:15:50.490
But this is presumably
what the planet could

00:15:50.490 --> 00:15:53.070
have looked like for the last
four billion years from space,

00:15:53.070 --> 00:15:56.000
was this blue planet that
has a sustained ocean.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.220
And that's why we're
here, because life

00:15:58.220 --> 00:16:02.080
could evolve and develop
because of this water world.

00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:05.480
And then as the
continents developed,

00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:09.610
we moved to the
continents, obviously.

00:16:09.610 --> 00:16:15.190
So the question then becomes,
what was this ancient ocean

00:16:15.190 --> 00:16:15.830
like?

00:16:15.830 --> 00:16:18.610
And that's the topic I'm
going to address today.

00:16:18.610 --> 00:16:20.050
And so what can we learn?

00:16:20.050 --> 00:16:22.190
So we can't learn much
by looking at water.

00:16:22.190 --> 00:16:24.630
I mean, you take
bucket of ocean water

00:16:24.630 --> 00:16:26.372
from anywhere, at any
depth of the ocean,

00:16:26.372 --> 00:16:28.080
or anywhere on the
planet, and you really

00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:29.910
can only get maybe
a few thousand years

00:16:29.910 --> 00:16:31.530
worth of Earth history.

00:16:31.530 --> 00:16:34.180
So from just
looking at water, we

00:16:34.180 --> 00:16:37.600
can't get a history
of the Earth, really.

00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:40.350
And so where can
we go to do that?

00:16:40.350 --> 00:16:44.244
Well, one place we can go is
to the middle of South Africa.

00:16:44.244 --> 00:16:46.160
This is a picture of my
daughter, [INAUDIBLE],

00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:48.610
and I sitting on a
banded iron formation

00:16:48.610 --> 00:16:52.080
in the Kalahari Desert, hundreds
of miles from the ocean.

00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:56.920
But we know that these
rocks were actually formed,

00:16:56.920 --> 00:16:59.700
were part of the seabed two
and a half billion years ago.

00:16:59.700 --> 00:17:01.940
This is a two and a half
billion year old outcrop.

00:17:01.940 --> 00:17:03.450
And these banded
iron formations are

00:17:03.450 --> 00:17:05.119
very important in
terms of telling us

00:17:05.119 --> 00:17:09.470
what the ancient ocean
was like, and how life may

00:17:09.470 --> 00:17:13.180
have come to develop on Earth.

00:17:13.180 --> 00:17:14.900
And so banded iron
formations have--

00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:19.069
this is a closeup here of one.

00:17:19.069 --> 00:17:20.960
And they have these
striated appearances.

00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:23.900
Where you see these very dark
red bands, that's hematite,

00:17:23.900 --> 00:17:27.569
a very iron-rich
mineral, interlayered

00:17:27.569 --> 00:17:31.030
with these chert layers,
which could be clays,

00:17:31.030 --> 00:17:32.960
muds, that developed.

00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:35.050
So you see a very
distinct pattern here.

00:17:35.050 --> 00:17:37.980
And as a scientist, that's
a very interesting thing.

00:17:37.980 --> 00:17:39.730
Whenever we see a
pattern, we think

00:17:39.730 --> 00:17:42.120
there must be some sort of
cause-and-effect relationship.

00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:43.670
Something was going on.

00:17:43.670 --> 00:17:45.530
There was some kind of
cycle, perhaps, going

00:17:45.530 --> 00:17:48.150
on here that could tell
us a lot about what

00:17:48.150 --> 00:17:50.830
the ancient Earth was like.

00:17:50.830 --> 00:17:55.940
And so we go to these banded
iron formations to study these.

00:17:55.940 --> 00:17:58.940
And these are not
small features.

00:17:58.940 --> 00:18:01.990
This is a picture of
an iron mine in Brazil.

00:18:01.990 --> 00:18:04.630
So banded iron formations
can be hundreds or thousands

00:18:04.630 --> 00:18:05.290
of feet thick.

00:18:05.290 --> 00:18:07.304
They can cover tens or
hundreds of square miles.

00:18:07.304 --> 00:18:09.220
These were enormous
events in Earth's history,

00:18:09.220 --> 00:18:13.450
when these iron
formations were laid down.

00:18:13.450 --> 00:18:15.200
And it's also
important to point out,

00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:18.870
this is where we get the
iron to produce steel.

00:18:18.870 --> 00:18:21.600
And because these are very
highly concentrated ores,

00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:23.220
steel is very cheap.

00:18:23.220 --> 00:18:27.420
We can thank this, really,
for modern civilization

00:18:27.420 --> 00:18:29.670
in some respects.

00:18:29.670 --> 00:18:35.120
So this timeline is going to
be a central theme of my talk

00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:36.160
for the ancient oceans.

00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:42.900
So we're starting here over on
the right side of the x-axis

00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:44.870
one billion years ago,
and then going back

00:18:44.870 --> 00:18:47.110
to four billion years
in Earth's history.

00:18:47.110 --> 00:18:49.140
And on the top panel
here, I'm showing

00:18:49.140 --> 00:18:52.200
what geologists have found
as the major episodes

00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:56.770
of banded iron, or BIF
deposition in Earth's history.

00:18:56.770 --> 00:19:05.600
So these are regions where we've
seen large BIF developments.

00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:08.070
And this tells us something
about the ocean chemistry

00:19:08.070 --> 00:19:09.490
here in the middle panel.

00:19:09.490 --> 00:19:12.450
And it also tells us something
about what the oxygen levels

00:19:12.450 --> 00:19:14.270
were like on early Earth.

00:19:14.270 --> 00:19:16.290
And the reason for
that is because to get

00:19:16.290 --> 00:19:20.050
this deposition of
these iron deposits,

00:19:20.050 --> 00:19:22.320
there must have been
ferrous iron in the ocean.

00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:25.310
So ferrous iron is soluble.

00:19:25.310 --> 00:19:27.680
But it reacts very
quickly with oxygen,

00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:31.810
and precipitates as something
like a banded iron formation.

00:19:31.810 --> 00:19:33.520
So in other words,
to get these types

00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:37.800
of formations there must
have been very low oxygen.

00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:40.270
And We believe those
oxygen levels were

00:19:40.270 --> 00:19:41.760
a fraction of a
percent of what we

00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:44.410
have today in the atmosphere.

00:19:44.410 --> 00:19:46.070
As we move forward
in time, there

00:19:46.070 --> 00:19:48.400
was what we refer to
as this great oxidation

00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:50.010
event, where at
least the surface

00:19:50.010 --> 00:19:52.230
ocean became oxygenated.

00:19:52.230 --> 00:19:54.610
That would have
reacted with the iron,

00:19:54.610 --> 00:19:57.660
precipitated some of it out.

00:19:57.660 --> 00:20:00.110
But then, most of the
iron would have probably

00:20:00.110 --> 00:20:04.090
been down in the deeper
sediments, not so reactive.

00:20:04.090 --> 00:20:07.270
And then there was
also this period.

00:20:07.270 --> 00:20:09.330
There was a lot of
sulfide being developed.

00:20:09.330 --> 00:20:11.130
Now the ocean is
very sulfate rich.

00:20:11.130 --> 00:20:14.660
In our modern ocean, we have
a lot of sulfate in the ocean.

00:20:14.660 --> 00:20:18.140
And the chemistry between iron
and sulfur is very interesting.

00:20:18.140 --> 00:20:20.620
You could actually have somebody
who is a sulfur geochemist

00:20:20.620 --> 00:20:23.710
or microbiologist talk,
and give a similar talk

00:20:23.710 --> 00:20:29.150
that would use sulfur as a proxy
for these ancient environments.

00:20:29.150 --> 00:20:31.330
But anyway, I'm going to
come back to this timeline,

00:20:31.330 --> 00:20:36.050
and use this kind of as a
theme for talking about how

00:20:36.050 --> 00:20:37.762
these banded iron
formations formed,

00:20:37.762 --> 00:20:39.970
and what that could tell us
about the different forms

00:20:39.970 --> 00:20:41.140
of life.

00:20:41.140 --> 00:20:44.620
So the first group-- and
since I'm a microbiologist,

00:20:44.620 --> 00:20:50.016
I have a very microbiological
slant on this particular topic.

00:20:50.016 --> 00:20:51.890
There are chemists who
have different views--

00:20:51.890 --> 00:20:53.800
that maybe there
was more chemistry,

00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:56.090
abiotic reactions going on.

00:20:56.090 --> 00:20:58.677
But I'm taking a very
microbialcentric point view.

00:20:58.677 --> 00:21:01.010
And the first group of organisms
I'm going to talk about

00:21:01.010 --> 00:21:04.810
are these bacteria that can
grow in the absence of oxygen,

00:21:04.810 --> 00:21:06.250
and carry out photosynthesis.

00:21:06.250 --> 00:21:08.870
It's called "anoxygenic
photosynthesis."

00:21:08.870 --> 00:21:12.390
And there's this process
here called photoferrotrophy,

00:21:12.390 --> 00:21:16.280
where these organisms can
take light and react with iron

00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:18.220
to extract chemical
energy, that they

00:21:18.220 --> 00:21:22.080
can use then used to fix
carbon dioxide to make cells.

00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:24.240
And the result of that is rust.

00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:30.080
Iron oxides precipitate
out as a rusty material.

00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:35.030
So this is a culture that was
isolated about 25 years ago,

00:21:35.030 --> 00:21:36.840
and it's growing in light.

00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:39.170
And it's using iron.

00:21:39.170 --> 00:21:42.400
And when you inoculate it,
you see the culture tubes

00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:43.340
turn rusty.

00:21:43.340 --> 00:21:44.770
So there's no oxygen in here.

00:21:44.770 --> 00:21:48.740
If this was just a
fully oxygenated tube,

00:21:48.740 --> 00:21:53.370
the iron that was in here
would oxidize very quickly just

00:21:53.370 --> 00:21:54.660
by itself.

00:21:54.660 --> 00:21:57.150
But there's no oxygen, so
the only way this can happen

00:21:57.150 --> 00:22:00.170
is by the bacteria
catalyzing this reaction.

00:22:00.170 --> 00:22:03.530
This slide on the right here
shows one of these bacteria.

00:22:03.530 --> 00:22:06.290
The white arrow there points
to the bacterial cell.

00:22:06.290 --> 00:22:12.800
And it's incrusted or
coated with these iron oxide

00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:14.620
particulates around it.

00:22:14.620 --> 00:22:16.270
And one thing you
note here, there's

00:22:16.270 --> 00:22:18.300
one little cell and
a lot of iron oxide.

00:22:18.300 --> 00:22:21.360
And that's a characteristic of
any microbe that oxidizes iron.

00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:23.590
It's actually quite
a poor energy source,

00:22:23.590 --> 00:22:28.020
so you have to oxidize a lot
of iron to make a living.

00:22:28.020 --> 00:22:30.420
So how could this
process have worked?

00:22:30.420 --> 00:22:33.380
This is a cartoon
from a colleague

00:22:33.380 --> 00:22:35.750
of mine, Ruth Blake at Yale.

00:22:35.750 --> 00:22:39.960
And this is the role for
these photoferrotrophs.

00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:44.400
So again, you have an ancient
ocean here, no oxygen,

00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:47.140
and these organisms
growing in the sunlight,

00:22:47.140 --> 00:22:50.240
oxidizing the iron which
forms these iron oxides.

00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:54.080
These rain down to
the ocean floor,

00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:56.880
and ultimately,
some of them end up

00:22:56.880 --> 00:23:00.080
being moved onto the continents,
and forming those banded iron

00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:03.920
formations through
geological processes.

00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:06.630
So another important thing
to point out-- the point

00:23:06.630 --> 00:23:08.600
that Ruth was making
with this slide--

00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:11.430
is that not only do you
precipitate these iron oxides,

00:23:11.430 --> 00:23:13.500
but we know that
iron oxides are very

00:23:13.500 --> 00:23:15.630
reactive with a lot
of other elements,

00:23:15.630 --> 00:23:17.250
particularly phosphorous.

00:23:17.250 --> 00:23:19.030
So they can bind a
lot of phosphorus,

00:23:19.030 --> 00:23:20.980
and that's shown here.

00:23:20.980 --> 00:23:22.647
And what would happen
is that iron oxide

00:23:22.647 --> 00:23:23.854
was raining out of the ocean.

00:23:23.854 --> 00:23:25.860
It was taking the
phosphorus out of the ocean.

00:23:25.860 --> 00:23:28.730
Now, phosphorous is another
very important nutrient

00:23:28.730 --> 00:23:30.230
for all of life.

00:23:30.230 --> 00:23:34.650
So perhaps, as that phosphorus
was stripped out of the ocean,

00:23:34.650 --> 00:23:37.870
that reduced the ability
of organisms to grow.

00:23:37.870 --> 00:23:40.410
And maybe you had
cessations in this process,

00:23:40.410 --> 00:23:41.980
and then the
phosphorus gradually

00:23:41.980 --> 00:23:45.980
built up again and
allowed the organisms

00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:48.710
to start working again.

00:23:48.710 --> 00:23:50.060
That's one possibility.

00:23:50.060 --> 00:23:52.970
That's one possible
explanation for these bands

00:23:52.970 --> 00:23:58.520
that we see in the
banded iron formations.

00:23:58.520 --> 00:24:01.220
So I'm going to come back
to the timeline again here.

00:24:01.220 --> 00:24:04.220
So I talked a little bit
about these photoferrotrophs,

00:24:04.220 --> 00:24:06.870
which may have played a
significant role, certainly

00:24:06.870 --> 00:24:09.570
from before the great
oxidation event,

00:24:09.570 --> 00:24:11.800
and definitely back in this
three and a half billion

00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:13.870
year time period, where
we see these banded iron

00:24:13.870 --> 00:24:16.270
formations, when we
know there was virtually

00:24:16.270 --> 00:24:19.380
no oxygen in the atmosphere.

00:24:19.380 --> 00:24:21.280
But what about this
great oxidation event?

00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:22.760
What happened here?

00:24:22.760 --> 00:24:26.300
So what happened here
was the cyanobacteria.

00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:29.710
And this is an image that
my colleague, Pete Countway

00:24:29.710 --> 00:24:32.210
at Bigelow, provided to me.

00:24:32.210 --> 00:24:34.280
This is a picture
of a cyanobacteria.

00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:36.290
And Pete actually did
a number of the images

00:24:36.290 --> 00:24:38.530
that you see of the tiny
giants on the wall here.

00:24:38.530 --> 00:24:44.020
He's a terrific oceanographer
as well as microscopist.

00:24:44.020 --> 00:24:46.060
And so this these
organisms grow.

00:24:46.060 --> 00:24:49.280
This is a colonial type
of these organisms.

00:24:52.110 --> 00:24:56.690
And they typically either
grow as single cells

00:24:56.690 --> 00:24:59.870
or sort of as these
microcolonies.

00:24:59.870 --> 00:25:01.390
And you can see the
very green color

00:25:01.390 --> 00:25:04.260
is due to the chlorophyll
these bacteria have developed.

00:25:04.260 --> 00:25:09.010
And so this was the evolution
of the first oxygenic

00:25:09.010 --> 00:25:11.160
photosynthesizing organisms.

00:25:11.160 --> 00:25:14.010
So these were the organisms
that we believe really

00:25:14.010 --> 00:25:16.900
provided the first source
of oxygen to the planet.

00:25:16.900 --> 00:25:19.700
So this was probably
the most important

00:25:19.700 --> 00:25:24.800
evolutionary adaptation
that we know of.

00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:27.140
So that's what these
organisms do, is they

00:25:27.140 --> 00:25:31.360
take carbon dioxide, and they
split water-- use light energy

00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:32.650
to split water.

00:25:32.650 --> 00:25:35.520
And then they, again,
produce their autotrophs.

00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:37.370
So they make their cell biomass.

00:25:37.370 --> 00:25:38.980
But the byproduct
of this process

00:25:38.980 --> 00:25:41.050
is oxygen. So at
this point, you could

00:25:41.050 --> 00:25:45.930
have oxygen in the Earth's
ocean start developing.

00:25:45.930 --> 00:25:49.800
So this picture here
is a cyanobacterial mat

00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:55.140
in Guerrero Negro in the
Baja Peninsula of California.

00:25:55.140 --> 00:25:57.750
This is considered sort
of a potential analog

00:25:57.750 --> 00:25:59.210
for the early
Earth, where you had

00:25:59.210 --> 00:26:03.010
shallow seas with these
mats forming on the ocean

00:26:03.010 --> 00:26:05.077
floor or the sediment.

00:26:05.077 --> 00:26:07.410
And the reason Guerrero Negro
is special-- it's actually

00:26:07.410 --> 00:26:08.159
quite salty there.

00:26:08.159 --> 00:26:09.800
It's near a saltworks.

00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:12.280
It's too salty
for macroorganisms

00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:15.175
to live-- snails, shrimp--
anything that would normally

00:26:15.175 --> 00:26:17.030
be grazing on these mats.

00:26:17.030 --> 00:26:18.640
So there's no grazing here.

00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:21.340
So these mats can develop in
ways that potentially they

00:26:21.340 --> 00:26:23.330
could have two billion
years ago when there

00:26:23.330 --> 00:26:25.640
were no macroorganisms around.

00:26:25.640 --> 00:26:27.730
And this is just a closeup
of one of these mats.

00:26:27.730 --> 00:26:29.930
The top layer here is
these cyanobacteria

00:26:29.930 --> 00:26:32.500
producing oxygen.
But then below it,

00:26:32.500 --> 00:26:34.570
you have all these
other layers, which

00:26:34.570 --> 00:26:38.120
are a lot of these anoxygenic
photosynthetic organisms--

00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:41.380
these purple bacteria that I
showed in the earlier slide.

00:26:41.380 --> 00:26:42.899
So you have very
complex communities

00:26:42.899 --> 00:26:43.774
that were developing.

00:26:47.410 --> 00:26:53.070
So now we have the cyanobacteria
that started producing oxygen.

00:26:53.070 --> 00:26:56.030
And we believe the
current information

00:26:56.030 --> 00:26:59.950
for when life
originated on Earth

00:26:59.950 --> 00:27:01.051
keeps getting pushed back.

00:27:01.051 --> 00:27:03.300
And it's now pushed back
almost to four billion years.

00:27:03.300 --> 00:27:05.720
There's chemical evidence
for organic molecules

00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:08.290
that could have been derived
from living organisms as

00:27:08.290 --> 00:27:10.130
long as four billion years ago.

00:27:10.130 --> 00:27:13.330
We think that the cyanobacteria
evolved somewhere between 3

00:27:13.330 --> 00:27:17.140
and 3.5 billion years ago,
although that may change

00:27:17.140 --> 00:27:18.450
in the next paper in Science.

00:27:18.450 --> 00:27:19.310
You never know.

00:27:22.310 --> 00:27:25.080
But at any rate, certainly
within this period,

00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:28.360
we believe that there
were these cyanobacteria.

00:27:28.360 --> 00:27:32.600
And so they were starting
to provide oxygen,

00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:38.600
and potentially providing these
oases of maybe local areas

00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:40.340
where there was quite
a lot of oxygen.

00:27:40.340 --> 00:27:43.024
And it doesn't show up
too well on this slide,

00:27:43.024 --> 00:27:44.690
but I'm showing these
little peaks here,

00:27:44.690 --> 00:27:47.190
where what we refer to
as "whiffs" of oxygen

00:27:47.190 --> 00:27:50.650
could have been in the
atmosphere and in the ocean.

00:27:50.650 --> 00:27:52.930
And so this could have
combined with iron,

00:27:52.930 --> 00:27:56.070
and started helping to
precipitate these banded iron

00:27:56.070 --> 00:27:58.600
formations.

00:27:58.600 --> 00:28:00.900
But there's also a
microbial role here, too.

00:28:00.900 --> 00:28:03.120
And I'm going to
talk about that now.

00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:05.060
Because that's really
what I work on, is

00:28:05.060 --> 00:28:08.660
a group of organisms that can
oxidize iron using oxygen,

00:28:08.660 --> 00:28:12.870
and use the energy they get
from that oxidation to grow.

00:28:12.870 --> 00:28:16.660
This is an image of
a hydrothermal vent.

00:28:16.660 --> 00:28:18.020
It's a diffuse flow vent.

00:28:18.020 --> 00:28:21.290
It's at Loihi Seamount about
1,000 meters below the surface.

00:28:21.290 --> 00:28:25.630
So what we have here is
a vent fluid coming out

00:28:25.630 --> 00:28:27.370
with a lot of iron
in it, flowing

00:28:27.370 --> 00:28:31.460
over this rock surface-- you see
all this rusty material here--

00:28:31.460 --> 00:28:34.392
and a little bit of oxygen.
This is an interesting site,

00:28:34.392 --> 00:28:35.850
because it's an
oxygen minima zone,

00:28:35.850 --> 00:28:37.340
so there's only a
few micro molar.

00:28:37.340 --> 00:28:40.780
This is about a
tenth of a percent

00:28:40.780 --> 00:28:43.200
of what is in our atmosphere.

00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:44.800
So who grows here?

00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:47.650
So this is an organism called
Mariprofundus ferrooxydans,

00:28:47.650 --> 00:28:50.040
which I isolated
about 20 years ago.

00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:52.870
And this was the first
iron oxidizing bacteria

00:28:52.870 --> 00:28:54.920
isolated from the
marine environment--

00:28:54.920 --> 00:28:56.200
a very interesting organism.

00:28:56.200 --> 00:28:58.020
This is the cell here.

00:28:58.020 --> 00:29:01.820
And so it it's oxidizing
iron, and producing this stalk

00:29:01.820 --> 00:29:04.480
material, which is composed
almost entirely of these iron

00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:05.650
oxides.

00:29:05.650 --> 00:29:08.410
And so this is the member of
a new class of proteobacteria

00:29:08.410 --> 00:29:10.740
called Zetaproteobacteria.

00:29:10.740 --> 00:29:13.810
They're very common in these
high iron environments.

00:29:13.810 --> 00:29:17.320
Hopefully, this movie
plays-- maybe not.

00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:19.420
Anyway, this was a movie
of time lapse images

00:29:19.420 --> 00:29:21.590
showing this bacterium growing.

00:29:21.590 --> 00:29:23.780
And as it grows, it forms
this stalk material,

00:29:23.780 --> 00:29:27.220
and makes this very
characteristic helical stalk.

00:29:27.220 --> 00:29:30.210
So just to show how
these organisms work,

00:29:30.210 --> 00:29:32.820
this is a process we call
chemolithoautotrophy.

00:29:32.820 --> 00:29:35.010
I expect you all to
remember that word.

00:29:35.010 --> 00:29:38.670
So these organisms,
again, they oxidize

00:29:38.670 --> 00:29:41.560
ferrous iron to this ferric
iron, which immediately

00:29:41.560 --> 00:29:44.120
precipitates as iron
oxide that they produce,

00:29:44.120 --> 00:29:46.440
and produce this stalk.

00:29:46.440 --> 00:29:49.100
They're able to take up
CO2, so their autotrophs.

00:29:49.100 --> 00:29:51.270
They can also fix nitrogen.
So they can pretty much

00:29:51.270 --> 00:29:54.630
do everything they
need to survive.

00:29:54.630 --> 00:29:58.500
And so could they have
played a significant role

00:29:58.500 --> 00:30:01.650
in forming these banded
iron formations when

00:30:01.650 --> 00:30:03.620
there was trace amounts
of oxygen present?

00:30:03.620 --> 00:30:06.160
And that's one of the
questions that we're definitely

00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:07.490
interested in.

00:30:07.490 --> 00:30:11.300
And to dig deeper
into that, this

00:30:11.300 --> 00:30:13.660
is a picture of
an intact iron mat

00:30:13.660 --> 00:30:15.530
that we brought up
from the ocean floor.

00:30:15.530 --> 00:30:18.270
So it's only about a
centimeter-- half an inch,

00:30:18.270 --> 00:30:20.502
maybe to an inch thick.

00:30:20.502 --> 00:30:22.460
I'll show a picture in
a minute, but these mats

00:30:22.460 --> 00:30:25.070
can get much more
extensive than that.

00:30:25.070 --> 00:30:29.170
But the top image here
is just the intact mat.

00:30:29.170 --> 00:30:31.150
And then what we've
done is sectioned it.

00:30:31.150 --> 00:30:33.770
And you can see, it has this
very fibrous appearance.

00:30:33.770 --> 00:30:36.450
And then as we focus in
with more and more powerful

00:30:36.450 --> 00:30:40.030
microscopes-- this is a scanning
electron micrograph here of one

00:30:40.030 --> 00:30:42.630
of these sections
of this mat-- you

00:30:42.630 --> 00:30:45.850
can see it's all this fibrous
material is those stalks that

00:30:45.850 --> 00:30:48.930
were produced by this organism,
this Mariprofundus-like

00:30:48.930 --> 00:30:52.150
organism that I described
earlier-- so amazing ability

00:30:52.150 --> 00:30:55.481
to carry out a lot
of iron oxidation.

00:30:55.481 --> 00:30:57.730
As a microbiologist, we're
very interested in the fact

00:30:57.730 --> 00:30:59.771
that these things all grow
in the same direction.

00:30:59.771 --> 00:31:03.630
We're trying to figure
out what's up with that.

00:31:03.630 --> 00:31:06.050
And there's a
whole other groups.

00:31:06.050 --> 00:31:09.150
There's a whole village of these
iron-oxidizing bacteria that

00:31:09.150 --> 00:31:12.180
live in these mats, that have
various different morphologies,

00:31:12.180 --> 00:31:14.690
which are very
characteristic of biology.

00:31:14.690 --> 00:31:17.850
You can't form these
types of structures

00:31:17.850 --> 00:31:20.460
without biology being
present, in the presence

00:31:20.460 --> 00:31:23.590
of these iron-oxidizing
bacteria.

00:31:23.590 --> 00:31:25.970
And just to bring
home the fact, these

00:31:25.970 --> 00:31:31.500
are not necessarily very
localized or very small

00:31:31.500 --> 00:31:33.020
features on the ocean floor.

00:31:33.020 --> 00:31:38.130
This is a place we call
The Golden Tower, which

00:31:38.130 --> 00:31:40.930
we found about two
years ago in the Mariana

00:31:40.930 --> 00:31:42.830
in the southwestern Pacific.

00:31:42.830 --> 00:31:45.390
And this is a meter here.

00:31:45.390 --> 00:31:47.640
When we first saw this
from the submersible,

00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:50.500
we thought it was an extinct
hydrothermal vent chimney.

00:31:50.500 --> 00:31:53.070
But we went up and started
really investigating it, poking

00:31:53.070 --> 00:31:55.400
it, we realized it was
constructed almost entirely

00:31:55.400 --> 00:31:56.870
of these microorganisms.

00:31:56.870 --> 00:31:59.210
We could stick the
temperature probe of Jason,

00:31:59.210 --> 00:32:00.960
the submersible, right
through this thing.

00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:02.990
We could have driven
Jason right through it.

00:32:02.990 --> 00:32:05.970
We didn't do that, fortunately.

00:32:05.970 --> 00:32:07.830
So the point is,
these organisms can

00:32:07.830 --> 00:32:10.090
form these really
interesting biofabrics,

00:32:10.090 --> 00:32:12.770
these mat-like structures here.

00:32:12.770 --> 00:32:14.520
And we can see these
in the fossil record.

00:32:14.520 --> 00:32:16.186
Again, because it's
a mineral structure,

00:32:16.186 --> 00:32:18.870
it's quite resilient if it gets
preserved in the right way.

00:32:18.870 --> 00:32:24.560
So this is a 300 million year
old hydrothermal vent sample.

00:32:24.560 --> 00:32:27.560
And you can see very
clearly these distinct sort

00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:30.010
of helical stalk-like
structures in this.

00:32:30.010 --> 00:32:32.020
Now we're going back in
the right picture here.

00:32:32.020 --> 00:32:34.040
We're going back
1.7 billion years

00:32:34.040 --> 00:32:36.920
old to these
filaments, which I also

00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:40.190
would believe could very
well be the remnants

00:32:40.190 --> 00:32:42.970
of ancient
iron-oxidizing bacteria.

00:32:42.970 --> 00:32:47.030
So this brings me back
to the timeline again.

00:32:47.030 --> 00:32:51.735
And so could these aerobic
iron-oxidizing bacteria

00:32:51.735 --> 00:32:54.530
have played a significant role
in this banded iron formation?

00:32:54.530 --> 00:32:58.750
And I would contend certainly,
at 1.7 billion years,

00:32:58.750 --> 00:33:01.830
we have pretty good
evidence that they

00:33:01.830 --> 00:33:03.430
were present, and
could have played

00:33:03.430 --> 00:33:07.191
a significant role in forming
these types of iron formations.

00:33:10.800 --> 00:33:14.340
It's harder when you go further
back in time, to this 2.5 to 3

00:33:14.340 --> 00:33:16.470
billion year period
here, to find

00:33:16.470 --> 00:33:17.810
really well-preserved rocks.

00:33:17.810 --> 00:33:21.250
And so one of our goals
in scientific research

00:33:21.250 --> 00:33:24.850
is to try to find places
where we could find

00:33:24.850 --> 00:33:26.890
actual preserved
evidence for these,

00:33:26.890 --> 00:33:29.580
or other biosignatures that
are associated with them.

00:33:29.580 --> 00:33:34.915
So I'm going to finish
up here, with this slide

00:33:34.915 --> 00:33:36.570
of the very modern ocean.

00:33:36.570 --> 00:33:39.690
This picture was given to
me by Catherine Mitchell,

00:33:39.690 --> 00:33:43.570
a post-doc at Bigelow
who studies ocean color.

00:33:43.570 --> 00:33:46.440
And so this is a picture from,
I think this was [? SEWIS ?],

00:33:46.440 --> 00:33:49.450
NASA's satellite, going
over the Gulf of Maine

00:33:49.450 --> 00:33:51.440
about three weeks ago.

00:33:51.440 --> 00:33:54.350
So here we are in Boston.

00:33:54.350 --> 00:33:56.820
Bigelow is right up about here.

00:33:56.820 --> 00:33:59.890
And I'll just let you
contemplate the beauty of what

00:33:59.890 --> 00:34:02.060
the modern ocean looks
like, and how fortunate

00:34:02.060 --> 00:34:03.370
we are to have it.

00:34:03.370 --> 00:34:07.970
And with that, I will also
thank sources of funding

00:34:07.970 --> 00:34:10.704
for this, that support my work
and a lot of the work that I've

00:34:10.704 --> 00:34:12.370
described, which, of
course, is the work

00:34:12.370 --> 00:34:14.860
of a lot of geologists,
earth scientists.

00:34:14.860 --> 00:34:17.070
But the National Science
Foundation and NASA

00:34:17.070 --> 00:34:20.429
are the two major supporters
of that work, and a number

00:34:20.429 --> 00:34:22.070
of colleagues, of
course, including

00:34:22.070 --> 00:34:25.030
Pete Girguis from Harvard,
who I collaborate with.

00:34:25.030 --> 00:34:26.429
So thank you.

00:34:26.429 --> 00:34:29.429
[APPLAUSE]

00:34:36.201 --> 00:34:37.856
Thank you, David.

00:34:37.856 --> 00:34:41.350
So we'll move on to
the second presentation

00:34:41.350 --> 00:34:44.739
from Pete Girguis,
who is Professor

00:34:44.739 --> 00:34:50.360
of Organismic and Evolutionary
Biology here in Harvard.

00:34:50.360 --> 00:34:52.103
Thanks for coming, Peter.

00:34:52.103 --> 00:34:58.060
[APPLAUSE]

00:34:58.060 --> 00:34:59.610
Good morning, everyone.

00:34:59.610 --> 00:35:01.750
It is my pleasure
to be here today.

00:35:01.750 --> 00:35:05.240
Thank you to Liz Cohen and all
the organizers, and John Huth,

00:35:05.240 --> 00:35:06.950
for the invitation.

00:35:06.950 --> 00:35:08.700
This is a fantastic symposium.

00:35:08.700 --> 00:35:11.330
And I'm just as excited as
the rest of you to be here,

00:35:11.330 --> 00:35:14.790
and to see what some of these
amazing speakers who are coming

00:35:14.790 --> 00:35:16.800
up are going to share with us.

00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:18.310
Dave and I, as Dave
mentioned, were

00:35:18.310 --> 00:35:22.430
tasked with the
job of summarizing

00:35:22.430 --> 00:35:24.380
three billion years of life.

00:35:24.380 --> 00:35:27.100
This is a task I think
best left to the gods,

00:35:27.100 --> 00:35:29.800
for certainly she or he
would do better than I.

00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:31.840
But I will do my best.

00:35:31.840 --> 00:35:34.760
And thinking about what
Dave was presenting,

00:35:34.760 --> 00:35:37.450
who we sort of colluded
in this effort,

00:35:37.450 --> 00:35:40.680
decided that I wanted to
share with you a perspective

00:35:40.680 --> 00:35:44.400
on the evolution of
animals in our ocean,

00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:51.290
and to move from the past up to
today with the idea of giving

00:35:51.290 --> 00:35:54.730
you a sense of what
these animals look

00:35:54.730 --> 00:35:57.730
like to those of us who consider
ourselves physiologists.

00:35:57.730 --> 00:36:00.600
That is, what do the animals
in Earth's past look like?

00:36:00.600 --> 00:36:03.780
What do the animals in our
modern ocean look like?

00:36:03.780 --> 00:36:08.800
And what can that tell us
about our changing world,

00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:13.550
and how these anthropogenically
induced changes may

00:36:13.550 --> 00:36:17.530
shift the kind of diversity
we see in our ocean?

00:36:17.530 --> 00:36:20.190
So I'll start with the
evolution of animals.

00:36:20.190 --> 00:36:23.960
And by animals, I
mean organisms that

00:36:23.960 --> 00:36:26.320
have sort of complex shapes.

00:36:26.320 --> 00:36:28.170
This is not the same
as the evolution

00:36:28.170 --> 00:36:30.516
of life, which Dave gave
you a very nice overview of.

00:36:30.516 --> 00:36:31.890
But these are the
kinds of things

00:36:31.890 --> 00:36:35.290
that we might look at and
recognize as being animals.

00:36:35.290 --> 00:36:37.790
I'm going to start our
conversation about 600

00:36:37.790 --> 00:36:40.131
million years ago, in a
period in Earth's history

00:36:40.131 --> 00:36:41.630
where, as Dave
mentioned, we started

00:36:41.630 --> 00:36:44.940
getting these whiffs of
oxygen. And we started seeing,

00:36:44.940 --> 00:36:48.880
in the fossil record, evidence
for soft-bodied organisms

00:36:48.880 --> 00:36:52.580
that evolved in
this period of time.

00:36:52.580 --> 00:36:57.340
These early marine animals came
in a variety of amazing shapes.

00:36:57.340 --> 00:37:01.330
And for those of us who think
about life in a lower oxygen

00:37:01.330 --> 00:37:04.680
ocean-- as was likely the
case 600 million years ago--

00:37:04.680 --> 00:37:08.060
these shapes likely play a
role in conferring function.

00:37:08.060 --> 00:37:12.670
That is, for an organism that's
relatively simple in terms

00:37:12.670 --> 00:37:16.130
of its tissues-- meaning it
doesn't have lungs, and gills,

00:37:16.130 --> 00:37:18.710
and all these sort
of fancy apparati

00:37:18.710 --> 00:37:22.040
to help get gases out
of your environment--

00:37:22.040 --> 00:37:29.620
being thin, and having a
lot of ripples, or ruffles,

00:37:29.620 --> 00:37:33.160
or things of the sort, increases
what we call your surface area.

00:37:33.160 --> 00:37:36.400
And it helps them take
up the dissolved gases.

00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:37.530
And you can see that.

00:37:37.530 --> 00:37:40.020
You can see that in many of
the shapes of these organisms

00:37:40.020 --> 00:37:44.300
that we recover from
the fossil record.

00:37:44.300 --> 00:37:48.300
There is a debate
as to whether or not

00:37:48.300 --> 00:37:51.690
these organisms are related
to today's modern organisms.

00:37:51.690 --> 00:37:54.080
But for the sake of
this presentation,

00:37:54.080 --> 00:37:55.980
and for the sake
of our dialogue,

00:37:55.980 --> 00:37:58.990
I would just point out that
in this lower oxygen ocean,

00:37:58.990 --> 00:38:02.040
we have plenty of animal
or animal-like creatures

00:38:02.040 --> 00:38:04.810
that have shapes that tell
us something about how

00:38:04.810 --> 00:38:08.060
they may have access to oxygen.

00:38:08.060 --> 00:38:11.170
Now, a little later on,
coral reefs began to appear.

00:38:11.170 --> 00:38:12.910
And these are the
kind of corals that we

00:38:12.910 --> 00:38:16.580
think of today-- these sort of
large, reef-forming organisms.

00:38:16.580 --> 00:38:18.930
Believe it or not, they
bear a striking resemblance

00:38:18.930 --> 00:38:21.200
to many of the
reefs we see today.

00:38:21.200 --> 00:38:23.930
And then if you continue
moving forward in time,

00:38:23.930 --> 00:38:25.700
at about 400 million
years ago, we

00:38:25.700 --> 00:38:28.430
start to see the
first jawed fishes.

00:38:28.430 --> 00:38:30.350
This is a fish
called a Placoderm.

00:38:30.350 --> 00:38:33.380
It doesn't have scales in the
way you think of a fish having

00:38:33.380 --> 00:38:35.180
scales, but it had
the predecessor

00:38:35.180 --> 00:38:37.380
to scales-- that is,
these kind of bony plates

00:38:37.380 --> 00:38:40.220
that acted as armor
for this fish.

00:38:40.220 --> 00:38:42.930
Now, these and many
other organisms

00:38:42.930 --> 00:38:47.080
have continued to evolve
into the diversity of life

00:38:47.080 --> 00:38:50.350
we see in our ocean today.

00:38:50.350 --> 00:38:52.930
And so when we go to
something like a coral reef,

00:38:52.930 --> 00:38:54.990
we see echoes of
these organisms,

00:38:54.990 --> 00:38:57.590
whether they were
the frilly sort

00:38:57.590 --> 00:39:01.760
of invertebrate-like organisms
we saw back in the [INAUDIBLE],

00:39:01.760 --> 00:39:05.269
the reefs we saw about
500 million years ago,

00:39:05.269 --> 00:39:07.060
and of course, the bony
fish that we're all

00:39:07.060 --> 00:39:09.210
familiar with today.

00:39:09.210 --> 00:39:13.220
And you can see how
evolution has shaped life

00:39:13.220 --> 00:39:17.280
to occupy a variety
of niches or habitats,

00:39:17.280 --> 00:39:19.500
from the near shore
environments where

00:39:19.500 --> 00:39:23.280
we see beautiful communities
like these sharks and rays,

00:39:23.280 --> 00:39:26.970
to the darkest depths where
I do most of my research.

00:39:26.970 --> 00:39:28.580
This is an anglerfish.

00:39:28.580 --> 00:39:30.190
And actually,
while we're here, I

00:39:30.190 --> 00:39:32.450
can't resist-- this
is too much fun.

00:39:32.450 --> 00:39:34.920
I want to take a poll.

00:39:34.920 --> 00:39:37.700
How many of you
think this is a boy?

00:39:37.700 --> 00:39:38.600
See a show of hands.

00:39:41.740 --> 00:39:44.290
How many of you
think it's a girl?

00:39:44.290 --> 00:39:44.860
I love this.

00:39:44.860 --> 00:39:46.820
It's a well-informed audience.

00:39:46.820 --> 00:39:48.230
This is a girl.

00:39:48.230 --> 00:39:51.790
Her mate is probably
attached back here.

00:39:51.790 --> 00:39:55.150
Men bite onto females,
and they eventually

00:39:55.150 --> 00:39:58.890
degenerate into little more than
a pair of reproductive organs

00:39:58.890 --> 00:40:01.690
and some semblance of
fins, and that's it.

00:40:01.690 --> 00:40:03.640
So on my lazy
days, this actually

00:40:03.640 --> 00:40:04.640
sounds pretty appealing.

00:40:04.640 --> 00:40:08.240
But we'll move on.

00:40:08.240 --> 00:40:11.840
We have seen communities
evolve around

00:40:11.840 --> 00:40:19.120
these undersea volcanoes that
occupy our Earth's ocean ridge

00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:19.850
system.

00:40:19.850 --> 00:40:23.420
This is some 60,000
kilometers of a mountain range

00:40:23.420 --> 00:40:24.770
that's peppered with volcanoes.

00:40:24.770 --> 00:40:27.600
And you should know, 90% of
the volcanic activity on Earth

00:40:27.600 --> 00:40:29.430
takes place in the ocean.

00:40:29.430 --> 00:40:33.470
And many unique organisms have
evolved around these sites.

00:40:33.470 --> 00:40:36.080
I'll tell you about some
of them in a few minutes.

00:40:36.080 --> 00:40:38.860
But again, in the interest
of sharing some of the wonder

00:40:38.860 --> 00:40:42.080
that we scientists experience
when we study the ocean,

00:40:42.080 --> 00:40:45.240
I wanted to show
two short videos.

00:40:45.240 --> 00:40:49.315
This is, well, you'll
see what this is.

00:40:49.315 --> 00:40:51.440
But it certainly quickened
the beating of my heart.

00:40:51.440 --> 00:40:54.360
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:40:54.360 --> 00:40:57.540
This is an underwater
autonomous vehicle

00:40:57.540 --> 00:41:01.630
called a REMUS being attacked by
a Great White Shark-- or let's

00:41:01.630 --> 00:41:05.050
be clear here-- being
interrogated by a Great White

00:41:05.050 --> 00:41:05.550
Shark.

00:41:05.550 --> 00:41:08.540
This is the way they
understand their world.

00:41:08.540 --> 00:41:12.680
So this, for your
information, is on exhibit

00:41:12.680 --> 00:41:16.830
at the Woods Hole Oceanographic
Museum down in Woods Hole,

00:41:16.830 --> 00:41:19.390
if you want to go see it.

00:41:19.390 --> 00:41:23.970
Many of these other organisms
captivate our imagination

00:41:23.970 --> 00:41:25.110
in other ways.

00:41:25.110 --> 00:41:27.680
I'm fortunate to be working
closely with the Ocean

00:41:27.680 --> 00:41:28.620
Exploration Trust.

00:41:28.620 --> 00:41:30.550
This is founded by Bob Ballard.

00:41:30.550 --> 00:41:33.440
And it's an institute
solely dedicated

00:41:33.440 --> 00:41:36.330
to exploration, and outreach,
and engaging the public

00:41:36.330 --> 00:41:37.860
in ocean science.

00:41:37.860 --> 00:41:40.030
What you would hear is
a bunch of scientists

00:41:40.030 --> 00:41:45.440
screaming and yelling about
what you're about to see.

00:41:45.440 --> 00:41:48.690
As we dive in our ocean, we come
across things we don't expect,

00:41:48.690 --> 00:41:52.920
in this case a sperm whale-- a
young sperm whale checking out

00:41:52.920 --> 00:41:54.270
the remotely operated submarine.

00:41:54.270 --> 00:41:55.144
Can you see it there?

00:41:55.144 --> 00:41:56.800
It's just swimming underneath.

00:41:56.800 --> 00:42:00.220
And the scientists
went just berserk.

00:42:00.220 --> 00:42:02.916
And this, by the way, is
broadcast live in real time.

00:42:02.916 --> 00:42:05.540
So if any of you are interested,
you can look up Nautilus Live,

00:42:05.540 --> 00:42:07.330
and you'll be able to join
us on our expeditions.

00:42:07.330 --> 00:42:08.829
But check this out--
the sperm whale

00:42:08.829 --> 00:42:11.810
is just as interested
in us as we are in it.

00:42:11.810 --> 00:42:14.100
And you can see its
mouth, and its fin,

00:42:14.100 --> 00:42:17.550
and that's its belly
as it swims by.

00:42:17.550 --> 00:42:21.520
Now, these charismatic
macrofauna-- or megafauna,

00:42:21.520 --> 00:42:24.180
as we call them-- always
capture our imaginations.

00:42:24.180 --> 00:42:27.980
But it's important to remember
that today's ocean also

00:42:27.980 --> 00:42:29.420
harbors a lot of microbes.

00:42:29.420 --> 00:42:33.370
There are about 10 to the
27th microbes in our ocean.

00:42:33.370 --> 00:42:36.270
And if each of them
is a micron in length,

00:42:36.270 --> 00:42:38.130
and you placed them
end on end, they

00:42:38.130 --> 00:42:40.380
would extend 10 to
the 21st meters.

00:42:40.380 --> 00:42:44.290
This is 105,000
light years, so that

00:42:44.290 --> 00:42:46.220
would stretch to the
Milky Way, and would

00:42:46.220 --> 00:42:49.250
span our galaxy in microbes.

00:42:49.250 --> 00:42:51.580
And so that is a very
excellent reminder

00:42:51.580 --> 00:42:53.390
that just because
they are small doesn't

00:42:53.390 --> 00:42:54.880
mean they are unimportant.

00:42:54.880 --> 00:42:58.120
And in fact, the microbes
in our world run our planet.

00:42:58.120 --> 00:43:01.390
And without them, our
biosphere would come to a halt.

00:43:01.390 --> 00:43:05.200
And so in fact, sometimes
it's easy to forget

00:43:05.200 --> 00:43:10.670
that the ocean alone
represents about 85%

00:43:10.670 --> 00:43:12.647
of our planet's habitable space.

00:43:12.647 --> 00:43:14.230
And so that is every
other environment

00:43:14.230 --> 00:43:16.530
you think of-- from the
desert, to the tundra,

00:43:16.530 --> 00:43:19.980
to the upper half mile
of ocean-- all of that

00:43:19.980 --> 00:43:23.030
fits in the other 15%.

00:43:23.030 --> 00:43:26.960
So 85% of our planet's
biosphere is deep ocean.

00:43:26.960 --> 00:43:30.250
That's perpetually
dark, perpetually cold.

00:43:30.250 --> 00:43:31.810
And so while we tend
to think of that

00:43:31.810 --> 00:43:34.780
as the extreme environment,
arguably, we're

00:43:34.780 --> 00:43:36.890
the ones who live in
the extreme environment.

00:43:36.890 --> 00:43:39.110
And if you took this map,
and used the surface area

00:43:39.110 --> 00:43:40.710
to represent the
habitable space,

00:43:40.710 --> 00:43:43.200
it really should look
something like that.

00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:46.320
But our knowledge of our
oceans and its denizens

00:43:46.320 --> 00:43:48.100
really is still in its infancy.

00:43:48.100 --> 00:43:50.460
There's about two million
known animal species.

00:43:50.460 --> 00:43:53.060
Estimates from the
census of marine life

00:43:53.060 --> 00:43:55.520
suggest there's likely
18 million more species

00:43:55.520 --> 00:43:57.330
we have not discovered.

00:43:57.330 --> 00:43:59.740
If you are brave enough to
include microbes, and try

00:43:59.740 --> 00:44:03.100
to actually figure out what
a microbial species even is,

00:44:03.100 --> 00:44:05.440
that puts you up
at near a trillion.

00:44:05.440 --> 00:44:07.692
And again, these
microbes run our planet.

00:44:07.692 --> 00:44:08.650
They run our biosphere.

00:44:08.650 --> 00:44:12.070
And without them, we
wouldn't be able to live,

00:44:12.070 --> 00:44:15.320
yet we only have less than a
percent of them in culture.

00:44:15.320 --> 00:44:17.440
So we have a daunting
task ahead of us.

00:44:17.440 --> 00:44:19.950
And our ignorance about the
ocean, if I can call it that,

00:44:19.950 --> 00:44:22.880
is based in part on
its inaccessibility.

00:44:22.880 --> 00:44:24.950
It's a world that's very
different than ours.

00:44:24.950 --> 00:44:27.880
As I mentioned, on average,
the seawater temperatures

00:44:27.880 --> 00:44:28.766
are near freezing.

00:44:28.766 --> 00:44:30.390
Because once you get
into the deep sea,

00:44:30.390 --> 00:44:31.860
it's chronically cold.

00:44:31.860 --> 00:44:33.770
It's chronically dark.

00:44:33.770 --> 00:44:36.720
And this has an influence
on the evolution

00:44:36.720 --> 00:44:39.140
of life in that environ.

00:44:39.140 --> 00:44:41.650
And in this chronically
cold, chronically dark world,

00:44:41.650 --> 00:44:44.170
pressures increase
as you go deeper.

00:44:44.170 --> 00:44:46.870
And when you're at
the Mariana Trench,

00:44:46.870 --> 00:44:49.780
you're talking about 14,000 PSI.

00:44:49.780 --> 00:44:52.440
Those of you who fill
your car tires dutifully,

00:44:52.440 --> 00:44:55.050
top them off to about 35 PSI.

00:44:55.050 --> 00:44:57.250
So think about 14,000.

00:44:57.250 --> 00:44:59.410
This is about the
weight of 50 jumbo jets

00:44:59.410 --> 00:45:01.160
on any person in this room.

00:45:01.160 --> 00:45:04.900
And yet, life exists
there, and does just fine.

00:45:04.900 --> 00:45:07.950
But the ocean is a hostile
work environment for us.

00:45:07.950 --> 00:45:10.140
And that's what
makes it challenging.

00:45:10.140 --> 00:45:12.290
And so these organisms
thrive in our oceans

00:45:12.290 --> 00:45:14.710
through what I
would call a range

00:45:14.710 --> 00:45:16.250
of evolutionary adaptations.

00:45:16.250 --> 00:45:19.980
And that's really what I want to
focus on in the remaining time

00:45:19.980 --> 00:45:22.990
here, is to give you a
sense of what those are,

00:45:22.990 --> 00:45:26.740
and why it is that we see the
kinds of diversity that we see.

00:45:26.740 --> 00:45:28.280
So this is a glimpse
into our oceans

00:45:28.280 --> 00:45:30.250
through the eyes
of a physiologist.

00:45:30.250 --> 00:45:34.650
But our ocean really isn't one
homogeneous bucket of soup.

00:45:34.650 --> 00:45:39.900
It is an environment that
has many habitats within it.

00:45:39.900 --> 00:45:42.540
And starting from
the upper ocean,

00:45:42.540 --> 00:45:45.850
which is well lit by sunlight,
and a very dynamic and exciting

00:45:45.850 --> 00:45:49.080
place, as you go
deeper and deeper,

00:45:49.080 --> 00:45:51.810
and you find fewer and
fewer organisms-- equally

00:45:51.810 --> 00:45:54.950
interesting, equally
important, fewer in number,

00:45:54.950 --> 00:45:57.120
but incredible in
diversity, meaning we

00:45:57.120 --> 00:46:00.190
find organisms that we
don't find anywhere else

00:46:00.190 --> 00:46:03.100
on Earth, and in great numbers.

00:46:03.100 --> 00:46:05.890
So the upper ocean or what
we call the photic zone

00:46:05.890 --> 00:46:08.630
is what most people think
about when I say "ocean."

00:46:08.630 --> 00:46:11.940
It's a part of our ocean
that, from a physiologist's

00:46:11.940 --> 00:46:13.810
perspective, is
very energy rich.

00:46:13.810 --> 00:46:15.450
There's plenty of sunlight.

00:46:15.450 --> 00:46:18.520
This leads to the growth
of algae, and diatoms,

00:46:18.520 --> 00:46:21.410
and other organisms that
are the primary producers

00:46:21.410 --> 00:46:22.080
of our planet.

00:46:22.080 --> 00:46:27.860
They're the ones who feed
the rest of the animals.

00:46:27.860 --> 00:46:30.360
And so it's that
availability of energy

00:46:30.360 --> 00:46:34.210
that allows organisms
to be very active,

00:46:34.210 --> 00:46:38.010
and provides them with energy
to cope with the temperature

00:46:38.010 --> 00:46:41.260
changes that occur
over day and night,

00:46:41.260 --> 00:46:43.790
changes that occur
seasonally, and the like.

00:46:43.790 --> 00:46:45.620
But as you go deeper
into the ocean,

00:46:45.620 --> 00:46:48.920
the conditions become more
constant and more stable.

00:46:48.920 --> 00:46:52.120
That is, you don't see the
kinds of temperature or chemical

00:46:52.120 --> 00:46:53.820
oscillations that you do.

00:46:53.820 --> 00:46:57.920
And as a consequence of this
stability-- not only in space,

00:46:57.920 --> 00:47:00.330
but frankly, over
evolutionary time--

00:47:00.330 --> 00:47:03.780
we see this incredible
diversity of organisms

00:47:03.780 --> 00:47:05.530
arise in the mid-water.

00:47:05.530 --> 00:47:09.180
For example, this is a
creature called Phronima.

00:47:09.180 --> 00:47:12.370
Does anybody recognize this?

00:47:12.370 --> 00:47:13.460
Couple of fans here, yeah.

00:47:13.460 --> 00:47:15.560
Those of you who are fans
of the Aliens movies,

00:47:15.560 --> 00:47:20.390
this was the inspiration--
no joke-- for the creature

00:47:20.390 --> 00:47:21.400
in the Aliens movie.

00:47:21.400 --> 00:47:23.850
And perhaps the artist
knew that this creature

00:47:23.850 --> 00:47:27.720
makes a living by killing
jellyfish, called salps.

00:47:27.720 --> 00:47:31.654
It kills the barrel-shaped ones,
and crawls inside their body,

00:47:31.654 --> 00:47:32.320
and lives there.

00:47:32.320 --> 00:47:34.410
That's what it does.

00:47:34.410 --> 00:47:37.909
This is a fish called
the barreleye spookfish.

00:47:37.909 --> 00:47:39.450
Anybody want to tell
me what this is?

00:47:39.450 --> 00:47:40.930
It's its mouth.

00:47:40.930 --> 00:47:42.600
What are those?

00:47:42.600 --> 00:47:44.110
Nope, that's its nose.

00:47:44.110 --> 00:47:45.550
Those are its eyes.

00:47:45.550 --> 00:47:48.060
It has a translucent
or transparent head,

00:47:48.060 --> 00:47:51.460
and two large eyes that
rotate inside its skull, that

00:47:51.460 --> 00:47:53.715
allow it to look upwards
and then forward.

00:47:53.715 --> 00:47:56.400
It's a really,
really wild critter.

00:47:56.400 --> 00:47:58.290
As we go deeper and
deeper into the ocean,

00:47:58.290 --> 00:48:01.310
we start to see
similarly wild organisms.

00:48:01.310 --> 00:48:04.590
We start to see things happening
that we still don't understand.

00:48:04.590 --> 00:48:07.540
For reasons that are unclear,
some organisms in the deep sea

00:48:07.540 --> 00:48:10.470
grow to incredibly large
size, like this amphipod,

00:48:10.470 --> 00:48:12.490
or a little beach hopper.

00:48:12.490 --> 00:48:15.980
And so their cousins, if
you will, on the beach

00:48:15.980 --> 00:48:16.790
are about this big.

00:48:16.790 --> 00:48:18.180
And they probably
irritate you when you're

00:48:18.180 --> 00:48:19.320
sitting there on the beach.

00:48:19.320 --> 00:48:21.540
In the bottom of
the Mariana Trench,

00:48:21.540 --> 00:48:23.560
this is how big they get.

00:48:23.560 --> 00:48:26.680
We see sea cucumbers that
have evolved to swim.

00:48:26.680 --> 00:48:29.410
This snail fish--
that is a new species.

00:48:29.410 --> 00:48:30.860
And there are
parts of our ocean,

00:48:30.860 --> 00:48:34.410
in fact, that have
always had, or rather

00:48:34.410 --> 00:48:37.470
that have low oxygen over time.

00:48:37.470 --> 00:48:40.300
They're sort of chronically low
in oxygen-- so-called oxygen

00:48:40.300 --> 00:48:41.460
minimum zones.

00:48:41.460 --> 00:48:43.690
And these are very
interesting, because as we

00:48:43.690 --> 00:48:46.550
start to see changes
to our climate,

00:48:46.550 --> 00:48:48.300
we start to see some
of these expanding.

00:48:48.300 --> 00:48:49.800
But I want to talk
to you about some

00:48:49.800 --> 00:48:51.799
of the denizens of this
zone, and I'll come back

00:48:51.799 --> 00:48:53.850
to why they're important later.

00:48:53.850 --> 00:48:56.860
But this is an area
with very little oxygen,

00:48:56.860 --> 00:49:00.670
and yet we see a diversity of
organisms that have evolved

00:49:00.670 --> 00:49:02.430
to cope with that low oxygen.

00:49:02.430 --> 00:49:05.690
We see these large sponges,
that we see on the sea floor.

00:49:05.690 --> 00:49:13.260
The famous vampire squid has a
blood protein that binds oxygen

00:49:13.260 --> 00:49:15.290
with incredibly high affinity.

00:49:15.290 --> 00:49:17.930
That means when it
comes into contact

00:49:17.930 --> 00:49:19.660
with a little bit of
oxygen in seawater,

00:49:19.660 --> 00:49:22.420
it can pull it out, and
provide it to the animal.

00:49:22.420 --> 00:49:24.564
Same with this organism
called gnathophausia, which

00:49:24.564 --> 00:49:27.820
is a kind of mysid shrimp.

00:49:27.820 --> 00:49:30.670
Organisms in the deep-- when
we get to the soft bottom

00:49:30.670 --> 00:49:33.120
sediments, many of them
have similar adaptations

00:49:33.120 --> 00:49:35.910
to low oxygen. We see
that a lot of them

00:49:35.910 --> 00:49:37.590
have symbionts
that can help them

00:49:37.590 --> 00:49:39.530
cope with sulfide,
that Dave mentioned,

00:49:39.530 --> 00:49:42.330
that may be produced
in sediments.

00:49:42.330 --> 00:49:44.210
There are also some
really neat morphological

00:49:44.210 --> 00:49:46.410
adaptations, like
this sea pen here

00:49:46.410 --> 00:49:49.290
that puts its stalk
in the sediment,

00:49:49.290 --> 00:49:52.481
puts its fronds upwards to get
oxygen and to filterfeed food.

00:49:52.481 --> 00:49:53.980
And this is just
one of my favorite.

00:49:53.980 --> 00:49:56.770
I just have to show
you the tripod fish.

00:49:56.770 --> 00:49:59.320
The pectoral fins have
turned into stands,

00:49:59.320 --> 00:50:01.380
so it's like a
little camera tripod.

00:50:01.380 --> 00:50:06.407
And its pectoral fins actually
are like two big baskets,

00:50:06.407 --> 00:50:07.990
and it puts its face
into the current,

00:50:07.990 --> 00:50:10.744
and it grabs food
as it comes by.

00:50:10.744 --> 00:50:12.160
But I have a soft
spot in my heart

00:50:12.160 --> 00:50:13.400
for the hydrothermal vents.

00:50:13.400 --> 00:50:15.940
These are the most extreme
environments on our planet,

00:50:15.940 --> 00:50:17.420
without question.

00:50:17.420 --> 00:50:20.490
Because of the pressure
found in the deep ocean,

00:50:20.490 --> 00:50:21.980
the water does not boil.

00:50:21.980 --> 00:50:23.840
And as a consequence,
the water temperature

00:50:23.840 --> 00:50:26.470
can reach 450 degrees Celsius.

00:50:26.470 --> 00:50:29.390
That's hotter than your
oven in self-clean mode.

00:50:29.390 --> 00:50:31.570
And yet, we see a
tremendous amount

00:50:31.570 --> 00:50:34.280
of life living around events--
not in the 400 degree waters.

00:50:34.280 --> 00:50:36.970
They actually live in the sort
of bathtub kind of temperature

00:50:36.970 --> 00:50:38.190
waters that you see.

00:50:38.190 --> 00:50:41.910
But this is a tremendous
amount of life that's

00:50:41.910 --> 00:50:44.030
based on chemical energy.

00:50:44.030 --> 00:50:47.560
The microbes that live
in vents will carry out

00:50:47.560 --> 00:50:49.890
processes similar to what
Dave shared with you.

00:50:49.890 --> 00:50:53.450
But instead of just
being iron, many of them

00:50:53.450 --> 00:50:56.330
are oxidizing compounds
like hydrogen sulfide--

00:50:56.330 --> 00:50:58.330
that rotten egg smell
that comes out of a sewer.

00:50:58.330 --> 00:51:00.164
Or they're getting
energy from methane.

00:51:00.164 --> 00:51:02.330
And we all know there's
plenty of energy in methane,

00:51:02.330 --> 00:51:05.440
if you've ever used a
gas grill or a barbecue.

00:51:05.440 --> 00:51:08.210
So these microbes have
evolved the capacity

00:51:08.210 --> 00:51:10.220
to harness energy
from these chemicals,

00:51:10.220 --> 00:51:12.280
and feed themselves
and their host.

00:51:12.280 --> 00:51:14.050
And so vents are
tremendously diverse,

00:51:14.050 --> 00:51:16.840
and harbor animals that are
some of the most tolerant

00:51:16.840 --> 00:51:19.490
on earth, including
these worms that

00:51:19.490 --> 00:51:22.450
are the most thermotolerant
animals that we know of.

00:51:22.450 --> 00:51:24.900
They can withstand the highest
temperatures, chronically,

00:51:24.900 --> 00:51:31.030
of about 55 degrees Celsius
or 120-ish or so Fahrenheit.

00:51:31.030 --> 00:51:34.210
Now, all these marine animals
have evolved morphological,

00:51:34.210 --> 00:51:36.750
physiological, and
biochemical capacities

00:51:36.750 --> 00:51:40.200
that enable them to thrive in
their particular environment.

00:51:40.200 --> 00:51:41.640
This is true whether
we're talking

00:51:41.640 --> 00:51:44.360
600 million years ago or today.

00:51:44.360 --> 00:51:47.960
And that includes variations
in oxygen, or carbon dioxide,

00:51:47.960 --> 00:51:50.220
or temperature, or
pH-- many of the things

00:51:50.220 --> 00:51:54.040
that we're worried about
in our changing world.

00:51:54.040 --> 00:51:57.070
There are marine organisms
that have evolved naturally

00:51:57.070 --> 00:51:58.650
to cope with those.

00:51:58.650 --> 00:52:00.700
You can see that some of
these marine organisms

00:52:00.700 --> 00:52:02.940
from [INAUDIBLE] look
a lot like the sea pens

00:52:02.940 --> 00:52:07.170
we have today, that again,
have these very frilly body

00:52:07.170 --> 00:52:09.970
plans to help them take
up oxygen and to feed.

00:52:09.970 --> 00:52:12.780
We know that some animals
have evolved unique features

00:52:12.780 --> 00:52:15.407
in their guts to host
certain kinds of microbes.

00:52:15.407 --> 00:52:16.990
In fact, this is a
study that I worked

00:52:16.990 --> 00:52:21.050
on with Dave Emerson looking at
the gut microbes of the North

00:52:21.050 --> 00:52:22.610
Atlantic right
whale to understand

00:52:22.610 --> 00:52:24.840
how they get their nutrition.

00:52:24.840 --> 00:52:27.972
And there are many other
biochemical attributes

00:52:27.972 --> 00:52:30.180
that have evolved, like
these two worms at the vents.

00:52:30.180 --> 00:52:32.530
They have a
hemoglobin-- actually,

00:52:32.530 --> 00:52:34.850
surprisingly similar to
yours and mine-- that can

00:52:34.850 --> 00:52:36.710
bind oxygen and bind sulfide.

00:52:36.710 --> 00:52:39.950
Even the mussels
that you would enjoy

00:52:39.950 --> 00:52:42.100
in a nice chioppino--
they are very

00:52:42.100 --> 00:52:44.226
tolerant to
environmental changes

00:52:44.226 --> 00:52:45.350
because of where they live.

00:52:45.350 --> 00:52:47.099
They can cope with
changes in temperature,

00:52:47.099 --> 00:52:48.670
and pH, and the like.

00:52:48.670 --> 00:52:50.470
So basically, look--
our oceans have

00:52:50.470 --> 00:52:52.920
and will continue to evolve.

00:52:52.920 --> 00:52:56.700
This will continue to happen,
whether we want it to or not.

00:52:56.700 --> 00:52:59.460
And they'll continue to
evolve-- I love this comic.

00:52:59.460 --> 00:53:00.700
I should just end it here.

00:53:00.700 --> 00:53:04.550
But they'll continue to evolve
whether you talk about oxygen,

00:53:04.550 --> 00:53:06.230
temperature, pH, and the like.

00:53:06.230 --> 00:53:08.290
But here's the
punchline-- as we think

00:53:08.290 --> 00:53:11.860
about the evolution of
animals over the last 600

00:53:11.860 --> 00:53:15.680
million years, it's important
to remember the rate of change.

00:53:15.680 --> 00:53:18.490
And most organisms
today are really not

00:53:18.490 --> 00:53:21.880
well poised to respond to
the rapid pace of change

00:53:21.880 --> 00:53:23.380
in our environment.

00:53:23.380 --> 00:53:26.450
And so the question
in some ways is

00:53:26.450 --> 00:53:28.460
that we know that
humankind is always going

00:53:28.460 --> 00:53:30.464
to have an impact on our ocean.

00:53:30.464 --> 00:53:31.880
The question is
really not, are we

00:53:31.880 --> 00:53:33.580
going to kill all ocean life?

00:53:33.580 --> 00:53:36.570
Because short of complete
nuclear holocaust,

00:53:36.570 --> 00:53:40.520
our activities are not likely
to bring our ocean to a halt.

00:53:40.520 --> 00:53:43.670
But the question is, what kind
of an ocean will we create?

00:53:43.670 --> 00:53:46.320
And so when we think about
the diversity of organisms

00:53:46.320 --> 00:53:48.550
that exist in our
ocean, bear in mind

00:53:48.550 --> 00:53:51.890
that as we see these
changes occurring,

00:53:51.890 --> 00:53:54.580
we will start to see things like
the increase in lobsters that

00:53:54.580 --> 00:53:56.820
was mentioned
earlier, and changes

00:53:56.820 --> 00:53:59.390
in our mid-water and
deep ocean community.

00:53:59.390 --> 00:54:02.670
And we have to recognize
that those changes come

00:54:02.670 --> 00:54:04.880
with an intrinsic and
an extrinsic loss,

00:54:04.880 --> 00:54:07.640
meaning that we're going to
lose natural biodiversity,

00:54:07.640 --> 00:54:09.830
but we may also
impact species that

00:54:09.830 --> 00:54:11.750
are important to
our own well-being.

00:54:11.750 --> 00:54:13.850
So with that, I'd like to
thank you for your time,

00:54:13.850 --> 00:54:15.410
and appreciate your attention.

00:54:15.410 --> 00:54:18.736
[APPLAUSE]

00:54:26.030 --> 00:54:27.850
Well, thank you very much.

00:54:27.850 --> 00:54:29.230
Yeah, that's working.

00:54:29.230 --> 00:54:35.690
So that's been a great
introduction to the day.

00:54:35.690 --> 00:54:39.560
As you see, we've been looking
at early life-- really,

00:54:39.560 --> 00:54:43.330
the early life from
three, three and a half

00:54:43.330 --> 00:54:47.410
billion years ago
from Dave, and we've

00:54:47.410 --> 00:54:50.020
been looking at the
evolution of animals,

00:54:50.020 --> 00:54:56.670
in particular from 500 million
years or so ago from Pete.

00:54:56.670 --> 00:55:00.200
So thank you for those
two great presentations.

00:55:00.200 --> 00:55:03.110
But we do have a gap in
between-- so between three

00:55:03.110 --> 00:55:08.710
billion years ago and 500
million years ago, we've

00:55:08.710 --> 00:55:14.100
got about two and a
half billion years.

00:55:14.100 --> 00:55:16.740
Presumably, things
happened during that time.

00:55:16.740 --> 00:55:19.190
So perhaps the two
of you would like

00:55:19.190 --> 00:55:22.260
to mention a few
things about what

00:55:22.260 --> 00:55:28.700
we know about how life
evolved during that time,

00:55:28.700 --> 00:55:33.790
and how the evolution of
oxygenic photosynthesis

00:55:33.790 --> 00:55:37.320
three billion years ago
ultimately permitted

00:55:37.320 --> 00:55:41.297
the evolution of animal
life 500 million years ago.

00:55:41.297 --> 00:55:43.422
I think you're the right
person for the job, Chris.

00:55:46.250 --> 00:55:47.140
Want to give it a go?

00:55:47.140 --> 00:55:48.140
Do you want me to start?

00:55:48.140 --> 00:55:48.320
Yeah.

00:55:48.320 --> 00:55:49.110
By all means.

00:55:49.110 --> 00:55:51.980
Yeah, [INAUDIBLE]

00:55:51.980 --> 00:55:52.980
The expert's right here.

00:55:55.630 --> 00:55:56.860
That was not my intention.

00:55:56.860 --> 00:56:00.510
Well, you're up here.

00:56:00.510 --> 00:56:02.102
Yeah, I didn't
prepare an answer.

00:56:02.102 --> 00:56:03.310
I just prepared the question.

00:56:06.649 --> 00:56:14.350
So certainly one thing, we know
that oxygenic photosynthesis

00:56:14.350 --> 00:56:16.970
evolved as we saw this morning.

00:56:16.970 --> 00:56:21.250
And that subsequent to that,
respiration sort of evolved.

00:56:21.250 --> 00:56:26.260
And respiration is
photosynthesis in reverse.

00:56:26.260 --> 00:56:32.030
So rather than consuming
CO2 and generating oxygen,

00:56:32.030 --> 00:56:36.210
respiration is consuming
oxygen and generating CO2.

00:56:36.210 --> 00:56:38.590
So this happened at some point.

00:56:38.590 --> 00:56:41.410
And then subsequent
to that, there

00:56:41.410 --> 00:56:45.160
was the evolution of
the eukaryotes, what

00:56:45.160 --> 00:56:47.190
Dave talked about
with the prokaryotes--

00:56:47.190 --> 00:56:52.250
the primitive bacteria
and Archaea organisms.

00:56:52.250 --> 00:56:54.750
Subsequently to those,
we had the eukaryotes,

00:56:54.750 --> 00:56:59.290
which are more complex
cells-- the sorts of cells

00:56:59.290 --> 00:57:02.880
that we have, where
we have respiration

00:57:02.880 --> 00:57:06.860
happening inside mitochondria,
which used to be bacteria

00:57:06.860 --> 00:57:09.540
that we acquired.

00:57:09.540 --> 00:57:14.920
And the photosynthetic
organisms took the cyanobacteria

00:57:14.920 --> 00:57:17.390
inside the cells, and
generated the chloroplasts,

00:57:17.390 --> 00:57:20.310
which power photosynthesis now.

00:57:20.310 --> 00:57:25.240
So we had the evolution of
the eukaryotic organisms--

00:57:25.240 --> 00:57:29.070
unicellular, still.

00:57:29.070 --> 00:57:33.730
And then I don't really
know too much more.

00:57:33.730 --> 00:57:37.510
Those may be the evolution
of some fairly primitive

00:57:37.510 --> 00:57:42.370
multicellular life forms, not
very complex, not very well

00:57:42.370 --> 00:57:45.480
developed, which then
subsequently gave birth

00:57:45.480 --> 00:57:49.680
to the incredible explosion
of multi-cellular life

00:57:49.680 --> 00:57:50.460
in the Cambrian.

00:57:50.460 --> 00:57:53.300
So I wonder how that happened.

00:57:53.300 --> 00:57:59.530
I think I had the privilege
of teaching a course a couple

00:57:59.530 --> 00:58:01.040
of years ago with Andy Knoll.

00:58:01.040 --> 00:58:03.690
And one of the things
that we really tried to do

00:58:03.690 --> 00:58:08.820
is step away from
concerning ourselves

00:58:08.820 --> 00:58:12.890
about the particular organisms
that evolved over time,

00:58:12.890 --> 00:58:15.460
and focus on this sort
of fundamental question.

00:58:15.460 --> 00:58:18.210
And I think Chris, you
set this up really well,

00:58:18.210 --> 00:58:21.472
in that as we think about
the evolution of life

00:58:21.472 --> 00:58:23.430
and the evolution of the
eucaryotes-- actually,

00:58:23.430 --> 00:58:26.420
let's go back to respiration.

00:58:26.420 --> 00:58:30.850
Once we start to see the
evolution of eukaryotes that

00:58:30.850 --> 00:58:37.105
have in them what was likely
a bacteria that now came

00:58:37.105 --> 00:58:38.480
inside another
cell, and you have

00:58:38.480 --> 00:58:41.280
a cell with this
mitochondria, which

00:58:41.280 --> 00:58:44.410
are your power
plants in your body,

00:58:44.410 --> 00:58:46.970
you have an organism
that's carrying out

00:58:46.970 --> 00:58:48.170
aerobic respiration.

00:58:48.170 --> 00:58:50.980
And from the physiologist's
point of view,

00:58:50.980 --> 00:58:52.530
one thing that's
neat to think about

00:58:52.530 --> 00:58:57.800
is how much energy you get
from different substrates

00:58:57.800 --> 00:58:59.510
that you might use.

00:58:59.510 --> 00:59:01.830
And so Dave talked a lot
about iron oxidizers.

00:59:01.830 --> 00:59:04.320
And if you start
looking at the energy

00:59:04.320 --> 00:59:08.810
yield you can get from oxidizing
iron with oxygen, or nitrate,

00:59:08.810 --> 00:59:10.980
or something else, you
get a certain amount

00:59:10.980 --> 00:59:13.360
of energy per mole.

00:59:13.360 --> 00:59:15.580
Or think of it as
like how much energy

00:59:15.580 --> 00:59:18.700
do you get from eating a dozen
eggs versus a dozen celery

00:59:18.700 --> 00:59:19.940
sticks?

00:59:19.940 --> 00:59:22.930
The eggs are going to have
a lot more energy per unit.

00:59:22.930 --> 00:59:26.470
And when we think about
energy metabolism,

00:59:26.470 --> 00:59:30.410
respiration is an incredible
way to get a lot of energy

00:59:30.410 --> 00:59:31.460
per unit substrate.

00:59:31.460 --> 00:59:33.470
And this opens up a
lot of possibilities.

00:59:33.470 --> 00:59:35.430
And it's, I would argue,
one of the factors

00:59:35.430 --> 00:59:39.100
why we see the evolution
of multicellularity.

00:59:39.100 --> 00:59:41.360
The punchline, in a way,
comes down to this--

00:59:41.360 --> 00:59:44.670
that all of the diversity of
animal life you see on Earth

00:59:44.670 --> 00:59:49.650
is based to a lesser extent
on the differences in energy

00:59:49.650 --> 00:59:50.650
metabolism.

00:59:50.650 --> 00:59:53.580
Because how you make your energy
is frankly, not that different

00:59:53.580 --> 00:59:58.030
than a goldfish, or a leopard,
or a snake, or a lizard.

00:59:58.030 --> 01:00:02.610
All of those organisms--
we all eat organic matter.

01:00:02.610 --> 01:00:05.730
I don't mean Whole Foods,
I mean organic matter.

01:00:05.730 --> 01:00:08.896
And we breathe
oxygen. And that's

01:00:08.896 --> 01:00:10.020
how we generate our energy.

01:00:10.020 --> 01:00:10.816
And that's it.

01:00:10.816 --> 01:00:12.940
You can hold your breath
and do some amount of work

01:00:12.940 --> 01:00:14.480
for some time, but that's it.

01:00:14.480 --> 01:00:17.860
Microbes have this tremendous
physiological diversity.

01:00:17.860 --> 01:00:20.890
Some of them seem to get
energy from oxidizing uranium.

01:00:20.890 --> 01:00:23.800
I mean, it's out of
control what microbes do.

01:00:23.800 --> 01:00:26.590
But we organisms, we get
our energy by eating things.

01:00:26.590 --> 01:00:28.500
And it's led to this
tremendous diversity

01:00:28.500 --> 01:00:30.500
of morphological adaptations.

01:00:30.500 --> 01:00:34.030
We see all these kinds of
multicellular life having

01:00:34.030 --> 01:00:36.430
very different shapes,
and different forms, that

01:00:36.430 --> 01:00:38.250
capitalizes on our environment.

01:00:38.250 --> 01:00:40.206
And so I think that
isn't necessarily

01:00:40.206 --> 01:00:41.830
what happened over
that period of time.

01:00:41.830 --> 01:00:43.530
But once you get
respiration, and you

01:00:43.530 --> 01:00:45.510
start to get
eukaryotes, you do start

01:00:45.510 --> 01:00:48.930
to see this diversification
of multicellularity.

01:00:48.930 --> 01:00:50.680
Excellent.

01:00:50.680 --> 01:00:53.180
So maybe I could just add a
little genetic touch to that.

01:00:56.810 --> 01:01:01.600
So the microbes that Pete
talked about as being incredible

01:01:01.600 --> 01:01:04.180
abundance, well, that
genetic diversity is also

01:01:04.180 --> 01:01:05.220
incredibly abundant.

01:01:05.220 --> 01:01:08.000
And all of our genes
are somehow derived

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:12.340
from a microbial ancestor,
and the gene for using oxygen.

01:01:12.340 --> 01:01:14.300
Pete and I are looking
at trying to-- one

01:01:14.300 --> 01:01:17.120
of the things we're interested
in is trying to measure how low

01:01:17.120 --> 01:01:21.540
a microbe can go in terms of its
ability to respire on oxygen.

01:01:21.540 --> 01:01:24.750
But it was the development
of those processes,

01:01:24.750 --> 01:01:28.760
and that genetic
adaptations, that ultimately

01:01:28.760 --> 01:01:31.271
led to multicellular life.

01:01:31.271 --> 01:01:32.770
And I think that's
a great question,

01:01:32.770 --> 01:01:40.370
is can we see those ancestral
gene exchange events,

01:01:40.370 --> 01:01:44.740
even, to try to
track that process.

01:01:44.740 --> 01:01:47.410
We'll perhaps take some
questions from the floor.

01:01:47.410 --> 01:01:51.000
So if you want to go to the
mike and start lining up.

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.480
And maybe while
you get organized,

01:01:53.480 --> 01:01:57.671
perhaps I'll ask another quick
question for the two of you.

01:01:57.671 --> 01:01:59.520
You did talk about--
in particular Dave,

01:01:59.520 --> 01:02:02.980
you talked about-- the
generation of oxygen,

01:02:02.980 --> 01:02:08.230
and how that has
influenced the Earth.

01:02:08.230 --> 01:02:09.750
But neither of you
talked too much

01:02:09.750 --> 01:02:14.760
about climate and the
connection between life

01:02:14.760 --> 01:02:17.780
on our planet and
changes in climate.

01:02:17.780 --> 01:02:21.760
So these organisms, in
addition to generating oxygen,

01:02:21.760 --> 01:02:25.010
they also manipulate carbon
dioxide and methane, which

01:02:25.010 --> 01:02:26.420
we know are greenhouse gases.

01:02:26.420 --> 01:02:30.690
So what evidence do we
have that life has actually

01:02:30.690 --> 01:02:34.600
changed our climate over time?

01:02:34.600 --> 01:02:35.660
Maybe answer quickly.

01:02:35.660 --> 01:02:36.410
And then--

01:02:36.410 --> 01:02:36.910
Sure.

01:02:36.910 --> 01:02:38.460
Dave, you want to
give it a shot?

01:02:38.460 --> 01:02:38.970
Sure.

01:02:38.970 --> 01:02:40.600
I mean, certainly
methane, obviously,

01:02:40.600 --> 01:02:42.220
is a microbial process.

01:02:42.220 --> 01:02:47.040
Most of the methane we
see in natural iron seeps

01:02:47.040 --> 01:02:48.670
is coming from methanogens.

01:02:48.670 --> 01:02:52.110
That was presumably a very
ancient group of organisms.

01:02:52.110 --> 01:02:53.730
I mean, they're very
oxygen sensitive,

01:02:53.730 --> 01:02:57.410
so they die in the
presence of oxygen.

01:02:57.410 --> 01:03:00.900
So that development of
methanogenesis and the methane

01:03:00.900 --> 01:03:06.090
production was certainly-- I
mean that might alone, as well

01:03:06.090 --> 01:03:10.177
as-- well, and then
also CO2 fixation,

01:03:10.177 --> 01:03:11.510
which we also didn't talk about.

01:03:11.510 --> 01:03:14.020
The other major innovation
besides photosynthesis

01:03:14.020 --> 01:03:17.260
was the development of RuBisCO,
the enzyme that actually fixes

01:03:17.260 --> 01:03:21.180
carbon dioxide, and makes
all the biomass we have--

01:03:21.180 --> 01:03:27.850
incredibly important in terms
of influencing the atmosphere.

01:03:27.850 --> 01:03:30.030
So two very quick
thoughts-- so one

01:03:30.030 --> 01:03:32.790
is, we should not
assume that our world is

01:03:32.790 --> 01:03:34.240
an aerobic world alone.

01:03:34.240 --> 01:03:36.670
There are plenty of anaerobic
environments in our world.

01:03:36.670 --> 01:03:40.440
And as Dave said, we're
very interested in the role

01:03:40.440 --> 01:03:42.292
that microbes play
in methane cycling.

01:03:42.292 --> 01:03:44.250
But there are also big
questions about the role

01:03:44.250 --> 01:03:47.420
they play in carbon
cycling, and just what's

01:03:47.420 --> 01:03:50.100
the fate of carbon that
gets buried, and the like.

01:03:50.100 --> 01:03:53.280
I know Professor Ann
Pearson is in the audience.

01:03:53.280 --> 01:03:55.370
And her lab studies
quite a bit of that.

01:03:55.370 --> 01:03:59.830
So it's really
vastly complicated.

01:03:59.830 --> 01:04:01.710
I guess that's a
good way to end.

01:04:01.710 --> 01:04:03.280
OK, so please go ahead.

01:04:03.280 --> 01:04:06.770
If you introduce yourself, and
then ask your question, please.

01:04:06.770 --> 01:04:08.120
My name is Adam Sachs.

01:04:08.120 --> 01:04:12.430
I'm with an organization called
Biodiversity for a Livable

01:04:12.430 --> 01:04:13.440
Climate.

01:04:13.440 --> 01:04:16.460
And I have a question
for Dr. Emerson.

01:04:16.460 --> 01:04:19.440
On your first two slides,
at four and a half

01:04:19.440 --> 01:04:24.410
billion years ago, we had a
very hot and inhospitable place.

01:04:24.410 --> 01:04:29.410
And on a given date-- say
June 4th, because that's

01:04:29.410 --> 01:04:33.030
my birthday-- in advance
of my birthday, in the year

01:04:33.030 --> 01:04:39.970
four billion BCE, the
Earth suddenly turned blue.

01:04:39.970 --> 01:04:42.810
Where did that water come from?

01:04:42.810 --> 01:04:43.580
Great question.

01:04:43.580 --> 01:04:46.110
So I looked into
this a little bit,

01:04:46.110 --> 01:04:58.630
because of course, this didn't
happen just on your birthday,

01:04:58.630 --> 01:05:02.870
unless you're a few
hundred million years old.

01:05:02.870 --> 01:05:05.720
But where the water came from--
so we believe a lot of it

01:05:05.720 --> 01:05:09.250
came from asteroids and
meteorites hitting the Earth.

01:05:09.250 --> 01:05:12.520
But there's also accumulating
evidence that a lot of it

01:05:12.520 --> 01:05:16.540
just came from rock
reactions, condensation

01:05:16.540 --> 01:05:20.210
as the planet condensed to
become a hard, rocky planet,

01:05:20.210 --> 01:05:22.870
that water was released
from those reactions, too.

01:05:22.870 --> 01:05:26.820
So people study
isotope ratios, and get

01:05:26.820 --> 01:05:29.190
into some very detailed
geochemistry, which

01:05:29.190 --> 01:05:31.959
I don't entirely
understand, I must admit.

01:05:31.959 --> 01:05:33.750
But it's an interesting
question, actually,

01:05:33.750 --> 01:05:36.960
as to where that
water came from.

01:05:36.960 --> 01:05:38.330
And it's a lot of water.

01:05:38.330 --> 01:05:45.450
But you know that the moon of
Europa, the moon of Jupiter,

01:05:45.450 --> 01:05:48.820
has an ocean that's twice the
volume of the earth's ocean?

01:05:48.820 --> 01:05:51.070
But it's under 20
kilometers of ice.

01:05:51.070 --> 01:05:53.780
So think about that.

01:05:53.780 --> 01:05:55.880
OK, next question, please.

01:05:55.880 --> 01:05:57.920
David Jackson,
Radcliffe Institute.

01:06:00.980 --> 01:06:04.940
Doctor Emerson was alluding
to genetic processes

01:06:04.940 --> 01:06:09.340
are very important in the
evolution of oceans and things

01:06:09.340 --> 01:06:10.320
that live in them.

01:06:10.320 --> 01:06:11.778
I wonder if you
could say something

01:06:11.778 --> 01:06:15.050
about the role of viruses,
which more and more are being

01:06:15.050 --> 01:06:19.450
discovered daily in the
oceans, both as agents

01:06:19.450 --> 01:06:23.480
for genetic exchange, and
as natural selective agents

01:06:23.480 --> 01:06:25.104
in their own right.

01:06:29.280 --> 01:06:32.866
You showed the picture of the
microbes strung [INAUDIBLE].

01:06:32.866 --> 01:06:34.490
How far do the viruses go?

01:06:34.490 --> 01:06:37.960
Yeah, exactly, that's probably
another astronomical number.

01:06:37.960 --> 01:06:42.240
So just to provide
a bit of context--

01:06:42.240 --> 01:06:46.480
so viruses can play a
role in moving genes

01:06:46.480 --> 01:06:48.150
from one organism to another.

01:06:48.150 --> 01:06:51.540
And one of the challenges we
have in thinking about microbes

01:06:51.540 --> 01:06:54.280
is that there seems to be
a degree of promiscuity

01:06:54.280 --> 01:06:56.320
among microbes in their genes.

01:06:56.320 --> 01:06:59.190
That is, we see genes from one
microbe in another microbe.

01:06:59.190 --> 01:07:01.480
This is also true
in animals, where

01:07:01.480 --> 01:07:05.830
we start to see genes in animals
and microbes, and vice versa.

01:07:05.830 --> 01:07:11.030
And so I think it
is absolutely fair

01:07:11.030 --> 01:07:16.390
to say that our community's
ongoing studies of viruses,

01:07:16.390 --> 01:07:18.420
or the so-called
virome, is going

01:07:18.420 --> 01:07:20.090
to show that they
play a tremendous role

01:07:20.090 --> 01:07:24.000
in the evolution of microbes
on Earth, and animals as well.

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:29.240
And so this, to me, really
challenges our notion

01:07:29.240 --> 01:07:33.760
of the species concept, which is
robust in the absence of that.

01:07:33.760 --> 01:07:37.880
But then, if we find out,
for example, that you, sir,

01:07:37.880 --> 01:07:41.770
are 3% algae-- I'm being
ridiculous-- but then

01:07:41.770 --> 01:07:43.110
what does that mean?

01:07:43.110 --> 01:07:46.460
And so a lot of work is being
put into studying viruses,

01:07:46.460 --> 01:07:48.990
not only in the open
ocean, but actually,

01:07:48.990 --> 01:07:52.520
in the deep subsurface
biosphere as well, where

01:07:52.520 --> 01:07:54.560
we know that there are
tremendous communities

01:07:54.560 --> 01:07:57.180
of microbes, and are trying to
understand the role of viruses

01:07:57.180 --> 01:07:58.175
in mediating exchange.

01:08:00.830 --> 01:08:02.970
Just one quick
addition to that--

01:08:02.970 --> 01:08:06.620
it's estimated by my colleagues
at Bigelow, some of whom

01:08:06.620 --> 01:08:09.590
are virologists, that basically,
all these phytoplankton

01:08:09.590 --> 01:08:14.850
you see on the walls here could
turn over almost every day,

01:08:14.850 --> 01:08:16.824
just due to virolysis as well.

01:08:16.824 --> 01:08:17.490
Oh, yeah, right.

01:08:17.490 --> 01:08:20.760
Just an incredibly important
process in terms of the carbon

01:08:20.760 --> 01:08:22.910
cycle in the ocean.

01:08:22.910 --> 01:08:25.430
So don't think of
viruses as just nasty,

01:08:25.430 --> 01:08:29.660
disease-causing things, but more
like lubricants in the ocean,

01:08:29.660 --> 01:08:32.350
making sure that the
ecosystem is turning over

01:08:32.350 --> 01:08:37.810
and gene flow and [INAUDIBLE].

01:08:37.810 --> 01:08:40.140
Next question, please.

01:08:40.140 --> 01:08:45.590
I am Prudence Steiner on the
Radcliffe Institute board.

01:08:45.590 --> 01:08:49.460
I have perhaps the most
naive question of all.

01:08:49.460 --> 01:08:51.719
And that is, how
do you define life?

01:08:54.817 --> 01:08:56.775
And by the way, I'm not
thinking theologically.

01:09:01.640 --> 01:09:03.479
One of those naive
questions [INAUDIBLE].

01:09:03.479 --> 01:09:05.069
Let's dump it on Chris again.

01:09:05.069 --> 01:09:05.569
Chris?

01:09:09.910 --> 01:09:14.510
Virus is not considered to be
living organisms, for example.

01:09:14.510 --> 01:09:19.580
So in our definition of life,
viruses are not in there.

01:09:19.580 --> 01:09:24.420
So then, they're not in there
because they are not self

01:09:24.420 --> 01:09:25.359
replicating.

01:09:25.359 --> 01:09:28.189
They need other
things to replicate.

01:09:28.189 --> 01:09:31.410
So yeah, once you cross that
border, that a virus isn't

01:09:31.410 --> 01:09:35.680
life, then where do you go?

01:09:35.680 --> 01:09:37.830
It's hard.

01:09:42.200 --> 01:09:45.310
You have to be able
to generate energy.

01:09:45.310 --> 01:09:48.256
You have to be able to
reproduce, replicate.

01:09:48.256 --> 01:09:53.040
I'd say those are-- and I
was just at the NASA workshop

01:09:53.040 --> 01:09:54.990
where we were discussing
some of these issues.

01:09:54.990 --> 01:09:58.530
And one of the issues that
came up was being able to move,

01:09:58.530 --> 01:10:03.180
being mobile, being able to
move is another potentially very

01:10:03.180 --> 01:10:04.770
important thing for life.

01:10:04.770 --> 01:10:05.970
Because you can move around.

01:10:05.970 --> 01:10:09.360
And to move, you
can eat in one spot.

01:10:09.360 --> 01:10:11.600
But if you can't
move somewhere else,

01:10:11.600 --> 01:10:14.995
then you consume
all your resources.

01:10:14.995 --> 01:10:16.370
And yet, of course,
we know there

01:10:16.370 --> 01:10:17.620
are organisms that don't move.

01:10:17.620 --> 01:10:19.160
I mean, it's a tough one.

01:10:19.160 --> 01:10:22.020
And this is of great interest
to the astrobiology community,

01:10:22.020 --> 01:10:26.150
because if we start looking for
life on other planetary bodies,

01:10:26.150 --> 01:10:29.420
the question is, do you
look for things like DNA?

01:10:29.420 --> 01:10:32.770
Well, you might not find
the same core molecules.

01:10:32.770 --> 01:10:36.374
And there may be other metrics
we need to put into place.

01:10:36.374 --> 01:10:37.190
Thank you.

01:10:37.190 --> 01:10:39.500
My name is Davidson
[? Reuben, ?] a student

01:10:39.500 --> 01:10:40.880
at Harvard.

01:10:40.880 --> 01:10:44.980
I'm curious as to-- this is
directed at Professor Peter

01:10:44.980 --> 01:10:52.150
Girguis-- given-- I'm not as
courageous as the previous

01:10:52.150 --> 01:10:55.220
questioner to ask the question.

01:10:55.220 --> 01:10:58.380
Given that there's not
been as much research

01:10:58.380 --> 01:11:00.620
as we've explored in
other fields, such just

01:11:00.620 --> 01:11:03.760
space and terrestrial
planes, what

01:11:03.760 --> 01:11:09.590
does the data give so far as to
what our oceans might become?

01:11:09.590 --> 01:11:12.635
As we've previously seen, it's
not going to be eradicated.

01:11:12.635 --> 01:11:14.010
It's not going to
be annihilated.

01:11:14.010 --> 01:11:18.740
So would it more favor
aerobic organisms,

01:11:18.740 --> 01:11:22.760
or will anaerobic organisms
grow in multitude?

01:11:22.760 --> 01:11:25.380
What would be the effects that
we see from the current data?

01:11:25.380 --> 01:11:27.410
Thank you.

01:11:27.410 --> 01:11:30.480
So Davidson's a
students in my class,

01:11:30.480 --> 01:11:33.231
by the way, so this is
definitely an extra credit

01:11:33.231 --> 01:11:33.730
point.

01:11:37.294 --> 01:11:39.710
So in the interest of time,
Davidson, I'll keep it simple,

01:11:39.710 --> 01:11:41.910
and say that I suspect our
speakers this afternoon are

01:11:41.910 --> 01:11:43.326
going to touch
upon a lot of that.

01:11:43.326 --> 01:11:45.030
So we'll let them do
the heavy lifting.

01:11:45.030 --> 01:11:48.370
But I think it's more
than just the simple idea

01:11:48.370 --> 01:11:49.950
of, oh, the temperature
might change,

01:11:49.950 --> 01:11:51.380
or oxygen might be less.

01:11:51.380 --> 01:11:54.140
Because those all have
subsequent consequences.

01:11:54.140 --> 01:11:58.950
If temperature changes enough,
and we disrupt the global ocean

01:11:58.950 --> 01:12:02.170
circulation, that
has huge implications

01:12:02.170 --> 01:12:05.500
for the distribution of
oxygen and other components.

01:12:05.500 --> 01:12:08.690
And so I'll leave it to our
speakers this afternoon.

01:12:08.690 --> 01:12:11.191
But that's the tough part.

01:12:11.191 --> 01:12:12.690
There is no crystal
ball that we can

01:12:12.690 --> 01:12:14.880
look into that says, oh,
it's as simple as this.

01:12:14.880 --> 01:12:16.570
We really don't
know, in my opinion.

01:12:19.720 --> 01:12:22.120
OK, well, if there's
no more questions,

01:12:22.120 --> 01:12:23.550
then thanks for your interest.

01:12:23.550 --> 01:12:27.360
And thanks to a great
starting session.

01:12:27.360 --> 01:12:29.160
