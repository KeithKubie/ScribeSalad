00:00:00.204 --> 00:00:02.094
Let's see if we can shed some light on the

00:00:02.094 --> 00:00:06.603
Alternative Minimum Tax,
which is also one of the most

00:00:06.603 --> 00:00:10.137
confusing aspects of taxation in the U.S.,

00:00:10.137 --> 00:00:13.563
but hopefully this video will
clarify things a little bit.

00:00:13.563 --> 00:00:15.735
So let's go back to that
example from the first video

00:00:15.735 --> 00:00:18.005
of the person making $100,000

00:00:18.005 --> 00:00:20.395
and what I'm going to do
is I'm going to calculate

00:00:20.395 --> 00:00:24.337
the AMT, the Alternative
Minimum Tax for that person

00:00:24.337 --> 00:00:26.813
then we're going to see
what happens from there.

00:00:26.813 --> 00:00:30.270
So Alternative Minium Tax
for someone making $100,000,

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:32.403
so what I've drawn right over here,

00:00:32.403 --> 00:00:36.145
this applies if you
make less than $300,000.

00:00:36.145 --> 00:00:39.403
The first 47,000 or so is exempt

00:00:39.403 --> 00:00:42.069
when you're calculating the
Alternative Minimum Tax.

00:00:42.069 --> 00:00:45.003
So for this person making $100,000,

00:00:45.003 --> 00:00:46.315
we're just going to have to consider

00:00:46.315 --> 00:00:49.603
the balance above 47,450.

00:00:49.603 --> 00:00:55.070
So 100,000 - 47,450, would be what?

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:00.070
It would be 50 ... It would
be 52,000 ... Let's see,

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:02.937
this would be ... So this amount
right over here is going to be

00:01:02.937 --> 00:01:13.671
52,000 and then 6 or 550 ...
52,550, if I did my math correct.

00:01:13.671 --> 00:01:18.205
That's 100,000 - 47,450

00:01:18.205 --> 00:01:20.403
and what the Alternative
Minimum Tax says is

00:01:20.403 --> 00:01:22.603
whatever you are above this exemption,

00:01:22.603 --> 00:01:25.603
above this 47,450 exemption,

00:01:25.603 --> 00:01:30.069
you're just going to pay
a flat 26% on that amount

00:01:30.069 --> 00:01:33.470
and if this person had made over 175,000,

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:35.269
it would have been a flat 28%,

00:01:35.269 --> 00:01:36.737
but let's not go there,
just complicates things

00:01:36.737 --> 00:01:39.647
and these things can get
arbitrarily complicated.

00:01:39.647 --> 00:01:42.005
And if the person made over 300,000,

00:01:42.005 --> 00:01:43.812
they would have to use the 28%

00:01:43.812 --> 00:01:46.736
and this 0, this
exemption would disappear,

00:01:46.736 --> 00:01:48.270
but once again, let's
not over complicate it.

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.980
Let's just focus on this person.

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:54.146
So this person has to pay 26% of 52,550

00:01:54.146 --> 00:02:06.563
which would be ... So it is
.26 x 52,550 gives 13,663.

00:02:06.563 --> 00:02:16.561
So 13,663. That is equal to 52,550 x 26%.

00:02:16.561 --> 00:02:18.752
So this would be the
Alternative ... Alternative

00:02:18.752 --> 00:02:21.204
Minimum Tax calculation, this 13,000.

00:02:21.204 --> 00:02:23.136
You're like, "Okay, that's not so bad."

00:02:23.136 --> 00:02:25.716
"Do I pay this above
and beyond the 21,000"

00:02:25.716 --> 00:02:27.559
"that we calculated in the first video?"

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:30.628
"You know, how does this work
out?", and the answer is no.

00:02:30.628 --> 00:02:33.506
You ... The IRS or your
accountant would look at

00:02:33.506 --> 00:02:35.270
both of these numbers and you would pay

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:37.269
the higher of the two.

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:39.842
So in this situation, your
regular taxes are higher

00:02:39.842 --> 00:02:41.645
than your Alerternative Minimum Tax,

00:02:41.645 --> 00:02:44.008
so you would just pay your regular taxes.

00:02:44.008 --> 00:02:47.646
Now this does come into
play in situations where

00:02:47.646 --> 00:02:50.197
1) if someone is making
a ton of money, the AMT

00:02:50.197 --> 00:02:51.936
is probably going to be the larger number,

00:02:51.936 --> 00:02:54.337
but in general it would
be the larger number

00:02:54.337 --> 00:02:56.284
if this person has a lot of deductions.

00:02:56.284 --> 00:02:59.270
So let's say they made $100,000,
but they're able to take

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:03.028
ten grand off because they
have ... They have mortgage

00:03:03.028 --> 00:03:04.319
interest that they can deduct,

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:06.736
so maybe they have all sorts
of other crazy deductions.

00:03:06.736 --> 00:03:10.480
So that their actual reported
income to the IRS becomes,

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.870
I don't know, well maybe
it becomes nothing.

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:14.339
Maybe they're able to deduct everything.

00:03:14.339 --> 00:03:17.205
So that with the regular
taxations, it goes down ...

00:03:17.205 --> 00:03:18.736
the reported income.

00:03:18.736 --> 00:03:20.737
When I say deductions, remember,
I'm not deducting taxes,

00:03:20.737 --> 00:03:22.896
I'm reporting income. So
they're able to keep taking

00:03:22.896 --> 00:03:25.649
things off of this until eventually
... Well, I won't say nothing,

00:03:25.649 --> 00:03:29.812
maybe their reported
income becomes $8,350.

00:03:29.812 --> 00:03:34.480
In which case, the regular
taxes would only be $835.

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:39.146
And in this situation, they
would have to pay the 13,663

00:03:39.146 --> 00:03:41.039
and that's the whole point of the AMT

00:03:41.039 --> 00:03:42.671
is because you had the
situation where people

00:03:42.671 --> 00:03:45.042
had all these deductions
and were able to get out of

00:03:45.042 --> 00:03:47.736
paying taxes even though
their income was pretty high,

00:03:47.736 --> 00:03:50.472
so they had this alternate
calculation to just make sure that

00:03:50.472 --> 00:03:54.267
people do pay some taxes.
