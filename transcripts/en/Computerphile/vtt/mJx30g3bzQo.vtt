00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.210
sound recognition is the art and science

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.410
of having machines identify sounds and

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.190
these are sounds beyond speech and music

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:13.530
so dogs barking glass being broken

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.890
babies crying etc this in itself is a

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.770
new academic discipline as well as a new

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.400
industrial discipline so has many

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.199
elements we understand and has some

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.880
elements that we don't understand yet.

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.349
Sound recognition is inherently an

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.600
artificial intelligence subject which

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.430
means the first place you start with is

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.550
from the data which in in this case is

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:39.780
going to be the audio recording

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.170
themselves and with any sort of AI

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.539
subject the the important thing to

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.610
understand is the variability in the

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.980
data so this is all the things that make

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.649
the sounds different so if you take some

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.170
even as simple as glass break one of the

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.760
things you run into immediately is

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.300
people have a pre-defined idea what

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.859
glass break sounds like often comes from

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.400
Hollywood movies Hollywood movies have a

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.170
specific technique on something called

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.470
Foley art where there actually have a

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.000
room where they're making the same

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.799
script as they go and they're trying to

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.270
make it sound like you think it should

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.420
sounds it's a bit of a self-reinforcing

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.380
method and doesn't necessarily sound

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:20.720
like the real thing

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.909
it's fascinating as a company out the

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.689
back of Cambridge where we're based who

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.049
supply a lot of audio into Hollywood

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.520
movies and one of the things I know they

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.710
supply is is core alarm sound effect

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:38.880
because I'm used to it now I hear on

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.380
every single movie that is and then

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.270
everybody thinks car alarms sound like

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.740
that car alarm on in fact they sell and

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.439
you know diverse range of car alarm is

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:47.970
just you get used to it this is the same

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.500
screen isn't a side effect I think

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:55.890
actually

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.149
there's some in music as well like

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:00.009
they're the famous feet that's used

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:01.539
across a range of different music and

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:03.430
you can has been studied on tracing the

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:05.799
heritage of it through hip hop into

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:08.440
house music etc etc Nativa Lucian in its

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:09.069
own right

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:26.230
see an unbreaking Bassin ating things

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:27.190
and they're the same thing kind of

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:29.049
happens for Saint now if you take

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:30.970
something like a glass break and you

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:32.980
imagine the actual this is a glass

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:36.040
window and the application for it's a

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.239
sound recognition as if somebody's

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:39.819
trying to break into a property then you

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:41.580
want to know that that's occurring and

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.660
detected before they into the property

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:45.280
so they're trying to you know smash it

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.799
with a hammer or a crowbar or whatever

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:49.660
I'll stare trying to smash it with so

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:51.190
that might make it sound different then

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:52.480
you've got the different types of glass

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.700
different size of the glass different

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.160
thicknesses of glass so you can laminate

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.739
plate wired tempered glass all of them

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:01.600
sound slightly different so if you

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.060
imagine two extremes straightforward

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:05.440
plate glass which is what most of us

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.389
have in our houses on our front windows

00:03:07.389 --> 00:03:09.430
double glazing when you break it it

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.980
breaks off into large shards and they

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:13.630
dong into each other as they fall down

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:16.630
so you get this drunk type sound coming

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:20.920
out of it if you take sometimes for to a

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:22.630
safety grass sometimes for this laminate

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:24.430
glass it's got a sheet of laminate in

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:26.560
the middle I'm sticky you break it the

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.780
whole piece breaks but the shards don't

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:30.549
fall off because it's designed to be

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:31.900
safe because that's what it's there for

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:33.850
each one of those things contributes

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:35.319
completely differently to the way the

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:37.299
sound is made up and all of that plus

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:39.250
all the thicknesses and sizes makes this

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.889
whole thing that we call glass break so

00:03:41.889 --> 00:03:43.269
you're going to go out and collect all

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:45.190
that data first before you can even

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:46.750
decide that is the thing I want to

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:49.930
detect so that's a big challenge then

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:51.700
you've got to collect all the other

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:53.230
sounds you don't want it to get confused

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:55.840
with so you sit down and say what else

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.040
is going to hear and I say it's in a

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.930
home you know maybe it's going to hear

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:01.269
people with cutlery you know cats and

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:03.910
knocking glasses off off the shelves

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:05.470
which you CLE don't want to say

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:08.140
breaking because it's not through to

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:10.030
just more sort of random stuff like

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:12.370
radios left on and things of that so you

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:14.980
get all these two big data sets okay so

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:16.239
you know all these data sets

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:18.790
you then have to get people because the

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:21.970
only way you can realistically treat and

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:23.520
make sure that your machine is

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.420
classifying what you wanted to is

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:27.370
somebody have to go through and say that

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:28.840
is this because it has to learn off

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:30.570
humans in the first instance so

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:32.320
something's going to sit down and so

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:34.600
glass starts here and stops here and

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:36.550
that's going to be done at extremely

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:39.280
accurate level you know sort of better

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:41.470
than tens of milliseconds sort of level

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:43.570
so really accurate something like glass

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:45.790
break I'm assuming is going to start

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:47.920
very suddenly a wave is going to be a

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:50.170
very sharp rise in volume very very

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:52.060
quickly and yeah if you imagined your

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:54.820
time's going that way amplitudes going

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:57.750
up there do you imagine a glass break it

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:00.460
and this is your your Big Bang and then

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:03.250
these sort of tinkling sounds if we're

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:05.080
talking about plate glass sound and if

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:06.310
we're talking about the other ones we

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:07.660
talking about these wouldn't gong as

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:09.070
much so you wouldn't have as much of a

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:11.590
tail to the sound if we use the actual

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:13.270
descriptions here there's a thing called

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:15.130
an envelope which is the way you

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:16.960
describe things and they're made up of

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:19.960
an attack a bit of a sustain decay and

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:22.240
then a sort of release phase a SD arc is

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:23.940
the way you describe these sort of

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:25.780
characteristics and can be used for all

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:27.640
sounds whether it's a violin or a piece

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:29.350
of glass being broken it looks to me

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:30.729
like it's very straightforward to find

00:05:30.729 --> 00:05:32.110
the beginning of that sound

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:34.330
but isn't it very visual to find the end

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:36.610
of it yes when you decide the end is

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:38.890
quite difficult obviously at some point

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:40.510
it hits the noise floor of the room and

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:42.040
you don't want to be saying to the

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:43.810
computer the noise floor is relevant to

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:45.100
what we're trying to learn because it's

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:47.530
not you know the noise floor in this

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:49.330
room is very different to the noise for

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:50.710
wherever this device is gonna be

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:52.450
deployed and will me by noise floor is

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:54.820
the acoustics of any places

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:57.040
well noise noise floor in itself is a is

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:59.950
a complicated area sorry audio always

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:01.450
then goes into levels of granularity

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:04.720
it's on those subjects so noise floor is

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:06.970
made up of whatever electrical noise so

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:08.440
is your film um this camera at the

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:10.720
moment the equipment you'll film has a

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:12.640
set of electrical noise and digital

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:14.919
noise it's going to be added to it then

00:06:14.919 --> 00:06:16.419
the buses are so and you've got the

00:06:16.419 --> 00:06:18.160
busses on side so you've got this chain

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:18.969
of noise all

00:06:18.969 --> 00:06:21.879
is all of that goes in to add up to the

00:06:21.879 --> 00:06:24.879
overall noise floor and clearly all of

00:06:24.879 --> 00:06:29.110
that is just random stuff and so you

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:31.149
don't want to necessarily be including

00:06:31.149 --> 00:06:33.999
that so yes it gets quite difficult you

00:06:33.999 --> 00:06:36.399
then if you switch to other sounds which

00:06:36.399 --> 00:06:38.889
have more semantically and big use

00:06:38.889 --> 00:06:40.899
definitions so we move on something like

00:06:40.899 --> 00:06:44.169
baby cry got a little girl

00:06:44.169 --> 00:06:46.659
so sometimes she's crying sometimes

00:06:46.659 --> 00:06:48.549
she's whinging sometimes she's moaning

00:06:48.549 --> 00:06:50.439
you know and and the exact definition

00:06:50.439 --> 00:06:52.749
can be a bit vague and it's obviously a

00:06:52.749 --> 00:06:55.869
continuous nature for us so some sounds

00:06:55.869 --> 00:06:58.209
we deal with are less clear about where

00:06:58.209 --> 00:07:00.429
they start and stop because they're less

00:07:00.429 --> 00:07:03.039
discrete events and that is then a

00:07:03.039 --> 00:07:04.269
difficulty because you saying well

00:07:04.269 --> 00:07:06.459
machine plee able to find somewhere

00:07:06.459 --> 00:07:07.899
layman's data so we can move on to the

00:07:07.899 --> 00:07:09.849
next phase which is train the machine to

00:07:09.849 --> 00:07:11.829
recognize it to get machines to

00:07:11.829 --> 00:07:15.309
recognize a specific pattern you have to

00:07:15.309 --> 00:07:16.899
look at the nature of a specific pattern

00:07:16.899 --> 00:07:21.789
is it video is it speech is it music no

00:07:21.789 --> 00:07:24.909
this is sound it's different from speech

00:07:24.909 --> 00:07:26.139
in the fact it doesn't have a language

00:07:26.139 --> 00:07:27.819
model you know last time I checked my

00:07:27.819 --> 00:07:29.349
windows vibrate them didn't speak to me

00:07:29.349 --> 00:07:33.489
and also in music you have some sort of

00:07:33.489 --> 00:07:37.089
structure to music depending sometimes

00:07:37.089 --> 00:07:39.189
you don't put not my particular love of

00:07:39.189 --> 00:07:42.279
the type of music but you know you have

00:07:42.279 --> 00:07:44.889
some set of things that restricts what

00:07:44.889 --> 00:07:46.119
sets of sounds you're going to hear in

00:07:46.119 --> 00:07:48.999
what order sounds are slightly different

00:07:48.999 --> 00:07:52.539
to that so the techniques you need to

00:07:52.539 --> 00:07:57.219
use to actually try and do our special

00:07:57.219 --> 00:07:58.929
intelligence technique of them are very

00:07:58.929 --> 00:08:01.259
different we have to set about building

00:08:01.259 --> 00:08:04.929
a whole new set of capabilities there a

00:08:04.929 --> 00:08:06.669
lot of it comes down to how do you

00:08:06.669 --> 00:08:09.999
describe the individual components of

00:08:09.999 --> 00:08:12.059
the sound that you want to recognize

00:08:12.059 --> 00:08:15.249
some of them we have to make up things

00:08:15.249 --> 00:08:17.259
for because they simply didn't exist

00:08:17.259 --> 00:08:19.719
so when you say disguise it you mean in

00:08:19.719 --> 00:08:22.809
human language or in terms of what I was

00:08:22.809 --> 00:08:27.030
referring in that bit to actually in

00:08:27.030 --> 00:08:30.240
what are called features which are

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:33.360
things that use describe the sound so a

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:35.310
really simple feature which would be

00:08:35.310 --> 00:08:37.800
practically useless to you but when we

00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:39.080
can have a conversation about would be

00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:42.930
volume yeah is it loud or quiet yeah

00:08:42.930 --> 00:08:45.000
well if you try and distinguish all

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.620
sounds in the world by is it loud or

00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:47.850
quiet you're not going to get very far

00:08:47.850 --> 00:08:49.680
in terms of identifying specific sound

00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:52.650
you need to keep adding range of

00:08:52.650 --> 00:08:54.300
descriptions and features in that

00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:56.250
regards this could be frequency this

00:08:56.250 --> 00:08:58.140
could be like a attack of the envelope

00:08:58.140 --> 00:08:59.670
or all these things couldn't display as

00:08:59.670 --> 00:09:01.530
different yeah you need hundreds of

00:09:01.530 --> 00:09:03.950
hundreds of these things to be able to

00:09:03.950 --> 00:09:06.600
adequately say if it's all of these

00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:08.550
things I've got a rough understanding of

00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:10.290
what it is and then you have to deal

00:09:10.290 --> 00:09:11.910
with it changes over time because sound

00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:14.190
changes over time so you've got that

00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:15.540
level of complexity but that's the sort

00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:17.730
of see the language side of it is

00:09:17.730 --> 00:09:19.380
fascinating so one of the problems we

00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:21.810
ran into straightaways you imagine sort

00:09:21.810 --> 00:09:23.190
of drawing those things out you very

00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:25.170
quickly run out of English and you very

00:09:25.170 --> 00:09:26.730
quickly run out of the ability to draw

00:09:26.730 --> 00:09:30.120
it so with something like even simple as

00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:33.630
baby cry we had to invent new English

00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:35.610
terms for things because otherwise you'd

00:09:35.610 --> 00:09:37.260
be sitting there go you know the bit

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:39.660
that goes like BPD boopity Bob there and

00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:40.890
then we got sorry I'm going to clear

00:09:40.890 --> 00:09:42.420
wait talking about yeah you're going to

00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:46.830
have sort of a lexicon a set of terms by

00:09:46.830 --> 00:09:49.500
which you know what each other a meaning

00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:51.570
otherwise you two engineers trying to

00:09:51.570 --> 00:09:53.250
model this thing will go off in

00:09:53.250 --> 00:09:54.240
different directions because they

00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:56.070
fundamentally don't have words to speak

00:09:56.070 --> 00:09:59.280
about so do you think that's a question

00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:01.500
of I mean other people who have some of

00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:03.210
these words you know it's a thing that

00:10:03.210 --> 00:10:05.520
gets talked about in say I don't know

00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:08.100
audio files and schools but maybe not so

00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:10.350
much in software no I think until you

00:10:10.350 --> 00:10:13.970
get into it sort of like a think of it

00:10:13.970 --> 00:10:15.990
you imagine the people who work for

00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:17.340
Oxford Dictionary or something like that

00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:20.130
until you actually need to concretely

00:10:20.130 --> 00:10:22.020
define the definition of a word for

00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:23.910
whole set of meanings there's no reason

00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:25.560
to come up with the language because you

00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:27.840
can just refer to it it is that it is

00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:29.940
this when you're actually trying to

00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:31.320
define something the first thing you do

00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:33.570
is churn to English I mean in my case

00:10:33.570 --> 00:10:37.160
the language of speak then it's the most

00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:38.730
flexible

00:10:38.730 --> 00:10:41.130
- we have to describe things and then

00:10:41.130 --> 00:10:42.750
you can have a conversation then you can

00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:45.600
build back up - you know understanding

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:48.360
and then from understanding into trying

00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:49.680
to teach a computer to understand it

00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:52.949
because going to good part and parcel so

00:10:52.949 --> 00:10:54.240
once you've got that there then you've

00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:56.930
got to move on to the machine learning

00:10:56.930 --> 00:11:01.139
side of it which is you've got to

00:11:01.139 --> 00:11:04.829
present all of this information to a

00:11:04.829 --> 00:11:09.449
system you've got to use a whole bunch

00:11:09.449 --> 00:11:11.370
of machine learning techniques some of

00:11:11.370 --> 00:11:13.639
which we have to develop ourselves to

00:11:13.639 --> 00:11:17.459
adequately then characterize all of that

00:11:17.459 --> 00:11:19.680
complexity down into something's

00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:22.110
incredibly small a lot of people do this

00:11:22.110 --> 00:11:24.420
kind of certainly speech recognition in

00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:25.980
the fire burn mode yeah speech

00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:27.449
recognition and the language model is

00:11:27.449 --> 00:11:29.519
typically done in the cloud obviously

00:11:29.519 --> 00:11:32.100
one thing you then run into is you've

00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:35.730
got a stream you might have to in our

00:11:35.730 --> 00:11:38.060
field stream the audio off the device

00:11:38.060 --> 00:11:40.260
24/7 well clearly that's going to have a

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:42.120
battery implication clearly because

00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:43.410
you've got to boot up something that

00:11:43.410 --> 00:11:46.319
transmits it to something clearly it's

00:11:46.319 --> 00:11:47.819
going to have a privacy implication

00:11:47.819 --> 00:11:50.699
because you're taking anything that's

00:11:50.699 --> 00:11:52.920
being heard and transmitting it up in

00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:55.800
the speech world they do what's called

00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:57.899
keyword awake word recognition on a

00:11:57.899 --> 00:12:02.100
device so you know this hey Siri hey

00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:04.529
Google you know whatever kicks it up and

00:12:04.529 --> 00:12:07.290
then the rest of that audio a lot of

00:12:07.290 --> 00:12:09.660
times being shipped up to the cloud and

00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:12.240
then analyzed and sent back down there's

00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:15.720
no equivalent of a wait word in our sort

00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:18.180
of industry so we're running all the

00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:19.860
time which means that you'd have to be

00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:21.180
shipping the audio awful time which

00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:22.319
doesn't sound like a good idea

00:12:22.319 --> 00:12:25.500
so we've had to really understand the

00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:28.380
math to make it compact enough to fit on

00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:30.209
a relatively small processor

00:12:30.209 --> 00:12:32.579
is it so yeah so you're not going to be

00:12:32.579 --> 00:12:35.010
going Alexa is a reverb were at the door

00:12:35.010 --> 00:12:36.649
and or is the burglar going to be going

00:12:36.649 --> 00:12:38.819
Alexa I've just broken in can you tell

00:12:38.819 --> 00:12:40.110
the homeowner you in so it doesn't

00:12:40.110 --> 00:12:41.790
doesn't work in that direction

00:12:41.790 --> 00:12:44.220
so when you get things like glass break

00:12:44.220 --> 00:12:47.850
or your smoke alarms going off or your

00:12:47.850 --> 00:12:50.660
babies crying these are all things that

00:12:50.660 --> 00:12:51.220
happen

00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:54.250
in these cases in a house the house if

00:12:54.250 --> 00:12:55.449
you were sitting downstairs on your

00:12:55.449 --> 00:12:58.149
couch you would say oh I need to react

00:12:58.149 --> 00:13:00.160
in this way it's sometimes you don't

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:02.529
hear it sometimes especially in the

00:13:02.529 --> 00:13:04.930
smart home industry you want the house

00:13:04.930 --> 00:13:06.310
to take care of you a little bit and

00:13:06.310 --> 00:13:09.100
take active you know sort of

00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:10.420
participation in trying to make your

00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:13.540
life a little bit easier and that's what

00:13:13.540 --> 00:13:15.040
it does it makes us house into more of a

00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:17.920
living a being than just a passive

00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:20.259
observer of all of the crazy things that

00:13:20.259 --> 00:13:22.029
you know go on from day to day hating on

00:13:22.029 --> 00:13:24.189
various houses yeah if only of this

00:13:24.189 --> 00:13:26.139
Akins away things like shoes own work

00:13:26.139 --> 00:13:28.029
for music recognition was that a

00:13:28.029 --> 00:13:30.939
different crafts that's that's a death

00:13:30.939 --> 00:13:35.079
different discipline of sound

00:13:35.079 --> 00:13:36.819
identification that's called fingerprint

00:13:36.819 --> 00:13:39.850
recognition so there's sort of if you

00:13:39.850 --> 00:13:41.110
want to lay a hand like that you've sort

00:13:41.110 --> 00:13:43.810
of got speech recognition then you've

00:13:43.810 --> 00:13:47.470
got a music identification music

00:13:47.470 --> 00:13:48.610
identification is great about

00:13:48.610 --> 00:13:50.370
identifying sounds that it's heard

00:13:50.370 --> 00:13:53.139
specifically before you know we've never

00:13:53.139 --> 00:13:55.060
heard a window in your house break but

00:13:55.060 --> 00:13:57.069
our system could detect that we've never

00:13:57.069 --> 00:13:59.259
heard it I don't hold your table if

00:13:59.259 --> 00:14:00.970
they're still young enough to cry we

00:14:00.970 --> 00:14:02.620
never heard them cry but we can identify

00:14:02.620 --> 00:14:04.930
that and that's a very different thing

00:14:04.930 --> 00:14:07.750
and that's this sound recognition piece

00:14:07.750 --> 00:14:10.240
or this artificial audio intelligence so

00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:12.040
that we provided subsets in the middle

00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:14.459
and it's a very different set of

00:14:14.459 --> 00:14:17.860
techniques and objectives I'd like to

00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:19.660
think I'd be able to hear index smashing

00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:21.100
behind me even though I've never heard

00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:23.019
that's absolutely there yet - because

00:14:23.019 --> 00:14:24.519
I'd want to duck out of the way of

00:14:24.519 --> 00:14:27.339
whatever is coming through yeah so is

00:14:27.339 --> 00:14:29.380
that is that a fair way it's kind of

00:14:29.380 --> 00:14:30.790
putting it you're attempting to do it

00:14:30.790 --> 00:14:33.160
more like a human yeah you're you're

00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:38.769
you're actually teaching it the the ax

00:14:38.769 --> 00:14:40.889
mattock components of the sound itself

00:14:40.889 --> 00:14:44.620
rather than just a high-level

00:14:44.620 --> 00:14:46.509
description especially in the case of

00:14:46.509 --> 00:14:48.850
the Shazam type comparisons where it

00:14:48.850 --> 00:14:53.350
just has you know the top 20 songs from

00:14:53.350 --> 00:14:54.579
all time which is a hell of an

00:14:54.579 --> 00:14:56.559
undertaking in itself and obviously a

00:14:56.559 --> 00:14:59.829
great piece of technology but in our

00:14:59.829 --> 00:15:01.209
case we're trying to help the computer

00:15:01.209 --> 00:15:02.420
understand

00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:03.740
what that sound means a quite a

00:15:03.740 --> 00:15:07.339
fundamental level so that when it is as

00:15:07.339 --> 00:15:09.200
you say you hear a piece of glass behind

00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:11.029
you and you think but a duck because

00:15:11.029 --> 00:15:12.079
that's going to hit me in the back of

00:15:12.079 --> 00:15:15.470
the head at some point then you know you

00:15:15.470 --> 00:15:16.910
can actually take some reasonable action

00:15:16.910 --> 00:15:18.980
off that so it's a different thing in

00:15:18.980 --> 00:15:23.510
that sense well for now we won't talk

00:15:23.510 --> 00:15:24.740
about exactly what's going on in this

00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:26.329
compression function but the idea is

00:15:26.329 --> 00:15:28.790
that the bits of ABCDE are being

00:15:28.790 --> 00:15:30.380
combined together they're being shuffled

00:15:30.380 --> 00:15:32.779
they're being promoted around to make it

00:15:32.779 --> 00:15:35.269
look more and more random as we go and

00:15:35.269 --> 00:15:36.860
at the same time we're bringing in bits

00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:39.910
from this message to
