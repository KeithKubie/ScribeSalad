well thank you very much and it is
 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:06.470
well thank you very much and it is
wonderful to see so many people together

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480
wonderful to see so many people together
 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.590
wonderful to see so many people together
on Friday afternoon who are interested

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:09.600
on Friday afternoon who are interested
 

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:14.060
on Friday afternoon who are interested
in in food those of us said the School

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070
in in food those of us said the School

in in food those of us said the School
of Public Health are looking at food

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770
of Public Health are looking at food
 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.850
of Public Health are looking at food
very intensively we have been for many

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:19.860
very intensively we have been for many
 

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:22.940
very intensively we have been for many
years and this is basically through the

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:22.950
years and this is basically through the
 

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:25.609
years and this is basically through the
lens of how does food affect health

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619
lens of how does food affect health
 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.519
lens of how does food affect health
that's probably most the most

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529
that's probably most the most
 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:29.839
that's probably most the most
fundamental question we have

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849
fundamental question we have
 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.089
fundamental question we have
specifically how how different foods

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099
specifically how how different foods
 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.810
specifically how how different foods
affect health differently if we're going

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820
affect health differently if we're going
 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.250
affect health differently if we're going
to have policies around food or for they

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260
to have policies around food or for they
 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.110
to have policies around food or for they
may be national policies international

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120
may be national policies international
 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.209
may be national policies international
policies or whether we're giving dietary

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219
policies or whether we're giving dietary
 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.970
policies or whether we're giving dietary
guidelines about food choices it's

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980
guidelines about food choices it's
 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.459
guidelines about food choices it's
really fundamentally important to have

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469
really fundamentally important to have
 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.400
really fundamentally important to have
the best possible information about how

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410
the best possible information about how
 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.680
the best possible information about how
our dietary choices affect our long-term

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690
our dietary choices affect our long-term
 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:00.470
our dietary choices affect our long-term
health and well-being that's I that's an

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480
health and well-being that's I that's an
 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.540
health and well-being that's I that's an
important question it's not so always

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550
important question it's not so always
 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.530
important question it's not so always
straightforward to answer that question

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:05.540
straightforward to answer that question
 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:07.910
straightforward to answer that question
ideally we would conduct large

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920
ideally we would conduct large
 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.310
ideally we would conduct large
randomized trials to address every

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320
randomized trials to address every
 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.389
randomized trials to address every
question we have such as what is the

00:01:14.389 --> 00:01:14.399
question we have such as what is the
 

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:16.219
question we have such as what is the
optimal egg consumption what is the

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229
optimal egg consumption what is the
 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.850
optimal egg consumption what is the
optimal trans fat consumption but for

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860
optimal trans fat consumption but for
 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.340

practical reasons those kinds of

practical reasons those kinds of
 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.350
practical reasons those kinds of
randomized trials are often very

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360
randomized trials are often very
 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.190
randomized trials are often very
difficult logistically unfit to conduct

difficult logistically unfit to conduct
 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.980
difficult logistically unfit to conduct

randomized trials is it they can often

give totally misleading answers mainly

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490
give totally misleading answers mainly
 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.420
give totally misleading answers mainly
because it's very difficult to assure

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430
because it's very difficult to assure
 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.020
because it's very difficult to assure
that individuals maintain the diet to

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030
that individuals maintain the diet to
 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.090
that individuals maintain the diet to
which they are signed for many years

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100
which they are signed for many years
