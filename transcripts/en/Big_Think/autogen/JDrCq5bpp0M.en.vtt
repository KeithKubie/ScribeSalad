well it means that you have a headache

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980
well it means that you have a headache
 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.240
well it means that you have a headache
and you end up reading about brain tumor

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250
and you end up reading about brain tumor
 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.180
and you end up reading about brain tumor
and there's a very good reason behind us

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190
and there's a very good reason behind us
 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:44.180
and there's a very good reason behind us
humans have a propensity to escalate to

humans have a propensity to escalate to
 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.330
humans have a propensity to escalate to
review the worst possible scenario

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:46.340
review the worst possible scenario
 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.190
review the worst possible scenario
probably to dismiss it so come back to

the headache if you went to your doctor

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690
the headache if you went to your doctor
 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.729
the headache if you went to your doctor
and you said I've a terrible headache

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739
and you said I've a terrible headache
 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.979
and you said I've a terrible headache
and your doctor said well you could have

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989
and your doctor said well you could have
 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.189

talk to me about the brain tumor and

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280
talk to me about the brain tumor and
 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.289
talk to me about the brain tumor and
essentially that's what happens online

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:08.299
essentially that's what happens online
 

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:11.359

people click on the worst case scenario

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369
people click on the worst case scenario
 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.469
people click on the worst case scenario
and therefore those scenarios get driven

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479
and therefore those scenarios get driven
 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:20.149
and therefore those scenarios get driven
up the ranking search rankings so the

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159
up the ranking search rankings so the
 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:21.980
up the ranking search rankings so the
point about search it's based on a
