00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.720
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:41.350
&gt;&gt; Sandra Charles: This morning,
we have truly a remarkable panel.

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:43.650
This is really the panel.

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:46.310
We don't have all of them
but this is the panel.

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:50.230
Ellen Sigal from Friends
of Cancer Research.

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:55.170
Dr. Louis Weiner-- Weiner, thank
you-- from Georgetown University,

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.340
Lombardi Comprehensive
Cancer Center.

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:02.820
All members of the Task Force
and the Blue Ribbon Panel

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:08.010
and two other people coming,
Dr. Singer and Dr. Lowy.

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:13.040
Dr. Lowy is the acting director
of the National Cancer Institute,

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.790
the agency that was basically
charged getting this together.

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:20.060
And Dr. Singer is the
Acting Deputy Director.

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:25.590
And so, you see we really have a
good set of people to enlighten us

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.980
and make us understand
how this is going

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:30.120
to affect us and change our lives.

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:35.700
I think we'll hear from Vice
President Biden, who was appointed

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.890
to lead this whole initiative by
the president, as many of you may

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:46.540
or may recall, in his State of
the Union Address back in January.

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:51.740
And I thought, who better to lead
us of and give us an overview

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.490
but Vice President Biden, so--

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:58.060
&gt;&gt; Joe Biden: Hi, everybody.

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:59.360
This is Joe Biden.

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:04.110 position:56%
I got a delivery report to President
Obama laying out how far we've come

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.070
since he put me in charge
of the Cancer Moonshot

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:09.150
that was back in January.

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:11.980
And to lay out a real vision
for where we need to go

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.450
in the immediate future to do

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:18.120
in five years what otherwise would
take 10, to inject the real sense

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.290
of urgency into the fight against
cancer, and to change the culture

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.990
and reimagine our system
in order to be able to win.

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:29.370
You know, when President Nixon
declared a war on cancer in 1971,

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:34.720
he had no army, he had no
resources, and no clear strategy.

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:38.350
But after 45 years of
progress, funding research,

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:41.670
training scientists and
physicians, and treating millions

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.990
of patients, we now have an army.

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:46.820
And we have tools, powerful tools.

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:52.060 position:56%
And with the Moonshot, we now have
a clear strategy for the road ahead.

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.990
It matters, folks, because
there's a consensus now that we're

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:57.960
at an inflection point with
science, medicine, technology,

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:01.740
all advancing faster than ever
and offering real promise.

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:04.120
We can't play by the rules in 1971.

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.130
We didn't have this working for us.

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:09.140
In 2016, there's much
more we can do.

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:12.170
Just five years ago, for
example, immunotherapy,

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:13.470
using the immune system

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:16.220
to kill cancer cells while
protecting healthy ones,

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:17.620
wasn't taken seriously.

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:18.920
Now it is and it's working

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.440
with other disciplines
and offering real hope.

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:25.230
Decades of research have
accumulated large amounts of data,

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.730
but that data is not shared,
it's hard to understand.

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:31.050
It is often not accessible to
researchers and the public.

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:34.180
But now we're in the position
to break down these silos

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:37.460
and share it all, because
we have an enormous capacity

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:40.480
with computing capability
to take millions

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:43.340
of pieces of data and analyze it.

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:47.210
We can do a million billion
calculations per second now.

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:50.590
And the Moonshot's vision report
reflects what my wife and I,

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:52.680
Jill and I, have learned
after meeting with thousands

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:56.710
of cancer patients, their families,
advocates, physicians, researchers,

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:59.930 position:56%
philanthropists, technology leaders,
and heads of states from all

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:01.930
over the world what we need to do.

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:05.660
We have to do everything from
enhancing prevention efforts,

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:09.590
expanding access to care, forging
an international commitment

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:11.150
to fight cancer.

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:13.430
This week, I also released
a report on--

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:17.280
from a Cancer Moonshot Task
Force, the team I'm leading

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.160
to reimagine the federal
government's fight

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:20.780
against this dreaded disease.

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:22.080
&gt;&gt; Sandra Charles: OK.

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:26.440
So, you heard it from
the VP himself.

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:27.960
&gt;&gt; Joe Biden: It touches
almost every corner

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:29.400
of the government, for example.

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:32.150
&gt;&gt; Sandra Charles: He had
more to say but we thought

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:37.200
that what we played would set
the stage for our discussion.

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:43.240
And to extend our warm
hospitality and welcome,

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:47.920
I have the Deputy Librarian of
Congress, Mr. Robert Newlen,

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:52.360
is here to extend that welcome
and some opening remarks.

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:54.370
&gt;&gt; Robert Newlen: Well,
good morning everyone.

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:58.580
It's my pleasure to welcome you
on behalf of the 14th Librarian

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:02.850
of Congress, Dr. Carla Hayden
to the Library of Congress.

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:05.050
And I'm not making this up.

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:09.510
One of her top priorities is to
improve the visitor experience.

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:13.390
[ Laughter ]

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:15.510
What was the prior--

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:21.210
[ Laughter ]

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:24.890
Dr. Hayden has had her own
experiences in the library,

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:31.860
navigating everything from parking
to exhibits, and this is something

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:35.230 position:56%
that she's talked a great deal about
and is really doing something about.

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:39.950
In fact, we have just hired--
he'll be arriving in February--

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:45.960 position:56%
an expert in museum visitor services

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:48.280
and how visitors, you
know, interact.

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:52.320
And-- So, I think we have a
great focus here for the future.

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:58.160
So, I sympathize with you and
we're going to try and improve it.

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:03.320
It's very nice to be addressing
a sober audience today.

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:07.020
As deputy librarian,
I have the privilege

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:10.550
of opening many conferences
not unlike this.

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:16.360
And last week, I opened a symposium
for the American Folklife Center

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:19.570
and they were celebrating
Kentucky Folklife

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:23.960
with an emphasis on
Kentucky bourbon.

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:29.210
And during the program, they had
a variety of Kentucky bourbons,

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:33.300
everything from Wild
Turkey to Maker's Mark,

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:36.140
and everybody was sampling
all the different bourbons.

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:40.240
So, by the time I got up, I
could have read the phonebook

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:41.540
and they would've applauded.

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:48.990
So, it's nice to have this
great attentive audience today.

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:52.670
The Library of Congress
has, as you probably know,

00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:55.950
an incredible collection
of treasures.

00:06:55.950 --> 00:07:00.960
Right now, we number just
about 162 million items,

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:05.500
everything from books,
manuscripts, films, recordings,

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:06.800
you name it we've got it.

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:10.120
And I hope if this is your
first visit to the library

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:13.460
that you'll have a chance to
explore it, either online.

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:15.170
We have a new website up.

00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:17.080
It's really-- I have
to say I love it.

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:19.700
It's really great,
much more accessible.

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:22.330
So I hope you'll be visiting
that but also visiting one

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:27.120 position:56%
of our three buildings here, because
it is an incredible institution.

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:29.410
But while we talk about
these treasures,

00:07:29.410 --> 00:07:32.600
really the greatest treasure
we have here at the Library

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:34.970
of Congress is the staff.

00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:41.260
The staff are just incredible from
everything, from our curators,

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:48.940
librarians, attorneys, experts,
just an incredible group of staff.

00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:50.240
But one of the treasures

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:55.230
that I specially treasure
is Dr. Sandra Charles.

00:07:55.230 --> 00:08:00.560 position:56%
And I can't tell you how grateful we
all are at the Library of Congress

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:05.220
for her leadership of health
services, for being proactive

00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:08.930
to attract events like this
to the Library of Congress.

00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:10.380
So, Dr. Charles, I just want

00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:13.520
to tell you how much I appreciate
the wonderful work you do

00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:16.510
for all the staff of
the Library of Congress.

00:08:16.510 --> 00:08:22.410
[ Applause ]

00:08:22.410 --> 00:08:27.080
I've been waiting for a moment to
do that, so I'm glad I could do it.

00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:33.860
Last night, I downloaded the
report because I wanted to read it.

00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:40.250
And I found it to be a
really fascinating report,

00:08:40.250 --> 00:08:44.470
but also for a layperson
like myself, very accessible.

00:08:44.470 --> 00:08:47.770
And I was also impressed with
the kinds of recommendations

00:08:47.770 --> 00:08:49.970
that were coming out of the report,

00:08:49.970 --> 00:08:53.640
things that are very practical,
that are very specific.

00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:55.990
And, you know, one
can't help but think

00:08:55.990 --> 00:08:59.130 position:56%
of one's own experience with cancer.

00:08:59.130 --> 00:09:03.440
Both of my parents died of
cancer, my father of liver cancer

00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:05.860
and my mother of lung cancer.

00:09:05.860 --> 00:09:09.800
So, Strategic Goal 4 was one
that really jumped out at me,

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:13.380
and that was strengthen
prevention and diagnosis.

00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:15.540
And I thought, you know,
if my parents had been able

00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:18.160
to take advantage of some of
the things that are recommended

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:21.600
in this report, their cancers
might have been caught earlier

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:26.500
or they might have had
better care at that time.

00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:30.750
So, I was just-- I can't tell you
how impressed I was with the report

00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:34.750
and the impact that it had on me.

00:09:34.750 --> 00:09:39.080
We're so very grateful
that the key members

00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:43.340
of the Cancer Moonshot Task Force
and Blue Ribbon Panel agreed

00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:47.100
to participate in this
panel discussion today.

00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:51.070
And I'm happy to see some
congregational colleagues here

00:09:51.070 --> 00:09:52.550
and policy experts.

00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:54.590
I see some folks from embassy.

00:09:54.590 --> 00:09:58.370
So, I'm really delighted that
this is also being videotaped

00:09:58.370 --> 00:10:02.390
so that we can share it with
others and take advantage

00:10:02.390 --> 00:10:07.350
of this great expertise that
we have with the panel today.

00:10:07.350 --> 00:10:11.760
Vice President Biden's
initiative is really a good example

00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:14.750
of new developments
in science policy

00:10:14.750 --> 00:10:17.080
and the so-called convergence.

00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:21.120
The idea, as I understand
it, is to break down walls

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:27.230
between scientific specialties and
create a dialogue among scientists

00:10:27.230 --> 00:10:29.190
in different disciplines.

00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:32.570
So, this panel is certainly
one of those efforts.

00:10:32.570 --> 00:10:34.920
I want to read a quote,
it's very appropriate.

00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:38.720
We just had this videotape
of Vice President Biden.

00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:42.670
But one of his quotes that
struck me particularly was,

00:10:42.670 --> 00:10:46.230
"We sought to better understand and
break down the silos and stovepipes

00:10:46.230 --> 00:10:49.720
that prevent the sharing of
information and impedes advances

00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:53.100
in cancer research and treatment
while building a focused

00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:55.660
and coordinated effort
at home and abroad."

00:10:55.660 --> 00:11:00.840 position:56%
So again, thank you to the panelists
and I know everyone is going

00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:02.280
to enjoy this panel today.

00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:03.840
And thank you for being here.

00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:05.640
&gt;&gt; Sandra Charles: Thank you.

00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:11.620
[ Applause ]

00:11:11.620 --> 00:11:15.070
So, you see, you got a good
old-fashioned library welcome.

00:11:15.070 --> 00:11:19.100
You learned some billings we
didn't intend to show you today.

00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:22.460
And you will have to come back
after March when our expert comes

00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:24.260
on board then you'll
see the new experience.

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:26.500
[ Laughter ]

00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:34.100
So, I have to say that when the
news of the Moonshot came out,

00:11:34.100 --> 00:11:36.480
it immediately got to my radar.

00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:40.860
And I wanted to make sure I
could bring it to the library

00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:45.750
and to share it because that
strategy that Mr. Newlen mentioned,

00:11:45.750 --> 00:11:48.930
having to do with prevention,
is precisely what we are

00:11:48.930 --> 00:11:51.300
about in health services.

00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:58.150 position:56%
And so, what we have done over the
past few years is to bring in many--

00:11:58.150 --> 00:12:04.420
as many partners as we can in
order to get our programs going.

00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:07.200
One such partner-- Or
actually we have a committee

00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:12.780
of such partners comprising library
employees, but one such partner,

00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:17.020
who is the chair of that
Wellness Advisory Committee,

00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:20.720
which is what we call
it, is Juanita Lyle.

00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:23.970
And she is a bundle of energy.

00:12:23.970 --> 00:12:27.050
She tags people as she calls it.

00:12:27.050 --> 00:12:29.900
And before you know
it, you're just tagged

00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:31.950
and you're just doing
so many things.

00:12:31.950 --> 00:12:37.820 position:56%
So when I expressed to Juanita what
one of our dreams was or our vision,

00:12:37.820 --> 00:12:41.260
she said I think I got this.

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:44.760
And sure enough, she looked at
the panel, recognized the name

00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:50.070
from the panel, this wonderful Dr.
Sigal to my right, left, center.

00:12:50.070 --> 00:12:52.120
[ Laughter ]

00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:56.820
And we got on a telephone
conversation and here we are.

00:12:56.820 --> 00:13:01.350
So, I'd like to bring Juanita
up just to give some perspective

00:13:01.350 --> 00:13:05.020
as a cancer advocate
about the initiative.

00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:07.150
And Juanita will tell
you but I'll tell you too

00:13:07.150 --> 00:13:09.180
because I'm so impressed by her.

00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:13.850 position:56%
She is a four-time cancer survivor
and started when we didn't have much

00:13:13.850 --> 00:13:17.050
to offer at all for breast
cancer in particular.

00:13:17.050 --> 00:13:21.810
So, she really is a testament
to so many things scientific

00:13:21.810 --> 00:13:24.910
and so many things
just natural order.

00:13:24.910 --> 00:13:29.510
So Juanita, would you please
come and give your perspective.

00:13:29.510 --> 00:13:41.150
[ Applause ]

00:13:41.150 --> 00:13:42.450
&gt;&gt; Juanita Lyle: Hi, everybody.

00:13:42.450 --> 00:13:48.340
This for me is the beginning of a
new day, beginning of a new time

00:13:48.340 --> 00:13:50.390
in the history of cancer.

00:13:50.390 --> 00:13:56.940 position:56%
You see, I am the past history of
cancer because I was back in the day

00:13:56.940 --> 00:14:00.020
when none of these was happening.

00:14:00.020 --> 00:14:06.330
In 1976, I was diagnosed with
a third stage breast cancer.

00:14:06.330 --> 00:14:11.320 position:56%
And I was only at that time-- So now
everybody knows my age, but now--

00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:14.160
at that time I was only 32.

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:19.170
And so, I was in the time where
it was old woman's disease,

00:14:19.170 --> 00:14:21.790
not a young woman's disease.

00:14:21.790 --> 00:14:27.040
So today, this year, is
actually my 40th year anniversary

00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:30.050
since my first diagnosis.

00:14:30.050 --> 00:14:37.000 position:56%
I had my first reoccurrence in
1980, my second reoccurrence in 1981

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.730
that had gone from
localized to regional.

00:14:40.730 --> 00:14:46.190
I had diagnosed actually both of my
reoccurrences and I've had a total

00:14:46.190 --> 00:14:50.800
of eight biopsies in
which four were negative.

00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:54.800
So, back then, when
I had my diagnosis,

00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:58.830 position:56%
I came into my doctor's office and I
told him, "OK, this is back again."

00:14:58.830 --> 00:15:02.150
And he looked at me
and he said, "Oh."

00:15:02.150 --> 00:15:06.540
And it just so happened that
it went back to the same place

00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:12.270 position:56%
if the decisive search we did-- I
had at that time because it had gone

00:15:12.270 --> 00:15:14.570
into the lymph nodes of my--

00:15:14.570 --> 00:15:17.890
lymph nodes that I had
were already infected

00:15:17.890 --> 00:15:21.130
with seven lymph nodes filled
with the cancer up in 19

00:15:21.130 --> 00:15:23.670
that were removed and the size

00:15:23.670 --> 00:15:28.800
of almost 5-centimeter
large tumor that I had.

00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:34.760
So, here I was the second time
and I came back to him and I said,

00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:36.740
"This crap is back again."

00:15:36.740 --> 00:15:42.890
And he kind of looked at me and
he says, "No, it couldn't be.

00:15:42.890 --> 00:15:46.160
You've had two years of--
You've had three years

00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:50.850
of two different protocols
of chemotherapy

00:15:50.850 --> 00:15:54.720
and you had a year tamoxifen,
so how is this possible?"

00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:59.810 position:56%
And he sat there and he fell and he
actually cried and fell apart on me.

00:15:59.810 --> 00:16:01.640
And I swayed him, "Get
this straight,

00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:03.380 position:56%
I am the patient, you're the doctor.

00:16:03.380 --> 00:16:07.110
You need to get this straight."

00:16:07.110 --> 00:16:10.390
So here I was after three years--

00:16:10.390 --> 00:16:13.260
So here I am after three
years of chemotherapy,

00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:16.640
three months radiation, a
year tamoxifen, and three--

00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:20.200
and that I had-- Here back then

00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:24.970
at that time I had a six-year-old
daughter and an eight-year-old son.

00:16:24.970 --> 00:16:31.150
So they watched me fight
cancer from 1976 to 1982.

00:16:31.150 --> 00:16:34.410
I didn't even get past
to five years.

00:16:34.410 --> 00:16:38.990
I also consented to a
clinical trial, which--

00:16:38.990 --> 00:16:42.960
of which I was the only
African-American to actually be

00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:47.430
in that clinical trial
in 1976-- '77.

00:16:47.430 --> 00:16:52.050
So, I've lived with many challenges
in the aftermath of cancer.

00:16:52.050 --> 00:16:55.800
Because back then, there
wasn't any monitoring of--

00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:59.540
one of the things that
Moonshot is going to be doing,

00:16:59.540 --> 00:17:06.170
there was not any monitoring of
how cancer, your chemotherapy

00:17:06.170 --> 00:17:09.900
and your radiation was done
because it was all about--

00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:15.900
back then, about the
disease that the person had,

00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:18.280
not the person who had the disease.

00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:21.580
So they did everything to
try to get rid of the disease

00:17:21.580 --> 00:17:27.580
but the same time, it ended up with
us doing time with other things

00:17:27.580 --> 00:17:30.880
down the road for the
aftermath of cancer.

00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:35.060
I had to create my own
patient navigator system

00:17:35.060 --> 00:17:36.960
because there wasn't any.

00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:39.330
There was not a patient
navigator program.

00:17:39.330 --> 00:17:43.870
What was really kind of ironic
about that, a couple years ago,

00:17:43.870 --> 00:17:51.550 position:56%
this is a quite a few years ago when
I had been chosen in 2001 to be one

00:17:51.550 --> 00:17:56.920
of NCI's CARRA members, which
is called Consumer Advocates

00:17:56.920 --> 00:18:00.860 position:56%
for Research and Related Activities.

00:18:00.860 --> 00:18:05.040
I had a chance to work on the
first African-American patient

00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:06.340
navigator workbook.

00:18:06.340 --> 00:18:09.260
So that was kind of an
ironic because I was coming

00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:13.750
in with experience from what
had happened to me of figuring

00:18:13.750 --> 00:18:16.570
out how I could pull
all my doctors together,

00:18:16.570 --> 00:18:20.760
how I could pull all them together
to say, OK, they're doing--

00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:22.790
she is doing this,
they're doing that.

00:18:22.790 --> 00:18:26.450
Here I was pulling together
my own navigation system.

00:18:26.450 --> 00:18:28.980
So, all of what has been happening

00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:33.550
with Cancer Moonshot are all the
things that I had been preaching

00:18:33.550 --> 00:18:40.070
to so many people for so many
years about looking at the patient

00:18:40.070 --> 00:18:44.650
and not looking at the
disease as the whole ball game.

00:18:44.650 --> 00:18:50.650
So today, this is a really good--
this is incredible day with me.

00:18:50.650 --> 00:18:57.820 position:56%
Unfortunately, in my life, my sister
ended up getting cancer three times

00:18:57.820 --> 00:19:00.590
but she got tired of the fight.

00:19:00.590 --> 00:19:04.890
She got tired of the unknown,
the unexpected, and uncertainty

00:19:04.890 --> 00:19:08.100
that cancer creates in our lives.

00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:14.700
She ended up-- She actually had
cancer in between the first time,

00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:17.530
in between my first
and second cancer.

00:19:17.530 --> 00:19:21.820
And back then, it was
shameful to have cancer

00:19:21.820 --> 00:19:25.560
because everybody thought
that you had done something.

00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:26.860
I hadn't done anything.

00:19:26.860 --> 00:19:31.310
I was a person that ate
right, that did the exercise,

00:19:31.310 --> 00:19:35.720
that did everything right but yet
I've turned up to have cancer.

00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:39.530
My late grandma died
of ovarian cancer.

00:19:39.530 --> 00:19:42.380
But they thought that
that was a cancer,

00:19:42.380 --> 00:19:45.650
that was a possible family history.

00:19:45.650 --> 00:19:52.790
Recently, I had a genetic testing
of 32 of my genes and they found

00:19:52.790 --> 00:19:56.820
that not one single of
my genes were mutated.

00:19:56.820 --> 00:20:01.040
So, therefore, they had to
rule out, family history.

00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:03.680
So, how I got it, I don't know.

00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:08.010
But I haven't been trained as
a scientist or as a doctor,

00:20:08.010 --> 00:20:11.840
but what I have been trained to do
is to walk in the shoes of cancer.

00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:19.070
So today, I say thank you Ellen for
taking the call and I say thank you

00:20:19.070 --> 00:20:24.150 position:56%
to Dr. Charles who challenges me
and encourages me with her knowledge

00:20:24.150 --> 00:20:28.470
of doctor extraordinaire,
who shares my vision for all

00:20:28.470 --> 00:20:30.610 position:56%
to stay well and have better health.

00:20:30.610 --> 00:20:32.510
Thank you.

00:20:32.510 --> 00:20:38.230
[ Applause ]

00:20:38.230 --> 00:20:39.910
&gt;&gt; Sandra Charles:
Thank you, Juanita.

00:20:39.910 --> 00:20:41.870
And although your program
says I'm going

00:20:41.870 --> 00:20:46.270
to give you my perspective
again, I won't do that.

00:20:46.270 --> 00:20:48.740
I will call on our panelists.

00:20:48.740 --> 00:20:54.400
And it's fitting also that Juanita,
as an advocate for patients,

00:20:54.400 --> 00:21:02.100
precedes our first speaker who is
Ellen Sigal, who is both Founder

00:21:02.100 --> 00:21:07.080
and Chairperson of
Friends of Cancer Research.

00:21:07.080 --> 00:21:10.500
And so, she is a member
of the Blue Ribbon Panel.

00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:15.400
And in her role as a cancer
advocate, she will explain to us

00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:23.860
and discuss the recently passed and
signed bipartisan Cancer Cures Act.

00:21:23.860 --> 00:21:26.350
And also talk about
some of the issues

00:21:26.350 --> 00:21:28.310 position:56%
that have been raised regarding some

00:21:28.310 --> 00:21:32.130
of the recommendations
vis-à-vis the FDA and others.

00:21:32.130 --> 00:21:35.210
So Ellen, without further
ado, your slides--

00:21:35.210 --> 00:21:39.700
excuse me, the slides will
be up and please come up.

00:21:44.900 --> 00:21:46.200
&gt;&gt; Ellen Sigal: Well, thank you.

00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:47.710
It's an honor to be here.

00:21:47.710 --> 00:21:49.740
And Juanita, what a story.

00:21:49.740 --> 00:21:52.860
What a story, what an
inspiration you are.

00:21:52.860 --> 00:21:57.930
As we all know, it is about the
patient and it's about the journey

00:21:57.930 --> 00:22:02.050
that they go through and their
family and how personal it is.

00:22:02.050 --> 00:22:06.310 position:56%
So, we care deeply about the science
but people get cancer and worth--

00:22:06.310 --> 00:22:10.260
there is none of us that are not
affected by generally started also

00:22:10.260 --> 00:22:13.130
on a personal loss with my sister.

00:22:13.130 --> 00:22:17.610
So, this week is a
really special week.

00:22:17.610 --> 00:22:19.760
This is a very special work-- week.

00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:22.820
The 21st Century Cures
bill was passed.

00:22:22.820 --> 00:22:24.120
We were lucky.

00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:25.420
Many of us were there
at the White House

00:22:25.420 --> 00:22:29.650
to see President Obama
signed the bill.

00:22:29.650 --> 00:22:34.150
My task today is to talk a
little bit about other components

00:22:34.150 --> 00:22:37.940
of the bill because you have
experts that will talk specifically

00:22:37.940 --> 00:22:41.920
about the Moonshot but there's a
lot more to it than the Moonshot,

00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:46.560 position:56%
although we are cancer advocates and
we're cancer people in this room.

00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:51.870
But this happens also
because of leadership.

00:22:51.870 --> 00:22:57.230
The Moonshot really came out of
a personal and devastating loss

00:22:57.230 --> 00:22:59.290
for Vice President Biden.

00:22:59.290 --> 00:23:02.680
You know, the loss-- any
loss is tragic but the loss

00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:06.410 position:56%
of seeing your child die is probably
the worst thing that any parent

00:23:06.410 --> 00:23:09.210
or anyone can really sustain.

00:23:09.210 --> 00:23:11.380
So it was his leadership,
his passion,

00:23:11.380 --> 00:23:14.210
and energy that really
got us to the Moonshot.

00:23:14.210 --> 00:23:17.750
So, I will go through a
few of the other components

00:23:17.750 --> 00:23:20.950
and then you will hear in detail
about the Blue Ribbon Panel.

00:23:20.950 --> 00:23:23.930
And I was very honored
to serve on it.

00:23:23.930 --> 00:23:29.800
One of the things that we all
know is that research is crucial.

00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:31.970
We cannot help patients
without research.

00:23:31.970 --> 00:23:35.350
And although we've invested a
lot, there's a lot more to do.

00:23:35.350 --> 00:23:39.250
When we declared the war on cancer,
we thought it was one disease,

00:23:39.250 --> 00:23:41.150
now it's hundreds of diseases.

00:23:41.150 --> 00:23:46.360
And we've accomplished a great
deal, but to really continue,

00:23:46.360 --> 00:23:48.300
we really need to invest
in research.

00:23:48.300 --> 00:23:51.790
And the research funding
has been really declining

00:23:51.790 --> 00:23:53.470
for many, many, many years.

00:23:53.470 --> 00:23:58.910
So this truly will help us get
young scientists and get people

00:23:58.910 --> 00:24:02.120
into research and this
is really a very, very,

00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:03.970
very important component of it.

00:24:03.970 --> 00:24:07.550
And not only will it have
1.8 billion for the Moonshot

00:24:07.550 --> 00:24:12.440
for the research, it will have
many for a precision medicine

00:24:12.440 --> 00:24:15.260
and for the brain initiative
and opioid addictions,

00:24:15.260 --> 00:24:16.560
so there are many other things.

00:24:16.560 --> 00:24:23.100
But there is more to
this than the research.

00:24:23.100 --> 00:24:27.390
It's helped also the
regulatory agency, the FDA.

00:24:27.390 --> 00:24:32.300
Before a patient gets a treatment,
it has to be approved by the FDA.

00:24:32.300 --> 00:24:37.500
And one of the important elements
of this bill is the Office

00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:44.130
of Cancer Oncology, the
consolidation of the cancer at FDA.

00:24:44.130 --> 00:24:47.930
Before this, it was in three
divisions, it was in CeBER,

00:24:47.930 --> 00:24:51.790
which was really biologics,
drugs, and CDRH.

00:24:51.790 --> 00:24:57.000
Now, all clinical decisions will
be made by oncology experts.

00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:59.420
And that's really important,
although it's really important

00:24:59.420 --> 00:25:03.350
to know about antibodies and
vaccines and diagnostics.

00:25:03.350 --> 00:25:06.160
We want these decisions to
really be made by people

00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:09.500
who really have treated this
disease in the natural history,

00:25:09.500 --> 00:25:12.550
and there will be resources
for this.

00:25:12.550 --> 00:25:17.130
The Office of Oncology will have
75 million over a period of years

00:25:17.130 --> 00:25:19.000
and the FDA will have 500 million

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:21.090
and there will be many,
many, many things.

00:25:21.090 --> 00:25:25.390
One of the things that are
really important in this,

00:25:25.390 --> 00:25:30.930
which I'm sure Dinah and Dr. Lowy
will cover, is the High-Risk,

00:25:30.930 --> 00:25:34.540
High-Reward Research, because
that's really important.

00:25:34.540 --> 00:25:38.930
We don't always get it right
and we want a young workforce

00:25:38.930 --> 00:25:43.100
and we want people to really
be audacious about ideas.

00:25:43.100 --> 00:25:45.180
Young scientists are crucial.

00:25:45.180 --> 00:25:46.770
We can't have a pipeline

00:25:46.770 --> 00:25:50.320
and we can't develop
these answers overnight

00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:54.240
and having people enter science
and have ways for them to come

00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:58.210
into science and to be attracted
and to keep them is really crucial.

00:25:58.210 --> 00:26:02.250
One of the other parts of
this bill that I'm very proud

00:26:02.250 --> 00:26:04.760
of is patient-centered
drug development.

00:26:04.760 --> 00:26:09.250 position:56%
And what that really means is
really getting patient's priorities.

00:26:09.250 --> 00:26:12.100
Everybody wants to live, everybody.

00:26:12.100 --> 00:26:14.110
And they want treatments
that will help them

00:26:14.110 --> 00:26:16.980
but they also want quality of life.

00:26:16.980 --> 00:26:19.960
They want to know things
that are important to them.

00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:22.630
You know, is it toxic?

00:26:22.630 --> 00:26:26.620
You know, will I feel a lot o pain?

00:26:26.620 --> 00:26:28.130
Will it handle my nausea?

00:26:28.130 --> 00:26:30.870
Will it handle things that
are most important to me?

00:26:30.870 --> 00:26:35.850
So, we tolerate a lot of toxicity
in cancer because we have to

00:26:35.850 --> 00:26:38.320
and we understand there's
a lot of risk.

00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:42.150
But we want the ability to really
understand the human experience

00:26:42.150 --> 00:26:43.450
and what it is like.

00:26:43.450 --> 00:26:46.610
Because if you have three
months or six months or a year,

00:26:46.610 --> 00:26:48.610
those months are really
important to you

00:26:48.610 --> 00:26:50.950
and the quality is important also.

00:26:50.950 --> 00:26:54.590
So, the idea of understanding
patient's needs,

00:26:54.590 --> 00:26:57.030
patient's priorities,
is really important.

00:26:57.030 --> 00:26:59.540
I think I don't know how
to advance my slides.

00:26:59.540 --> 00:27:01.480
Oh, sorry.

00:27:01.480 --> 00:27:06.970
OK, OK. I'm not going to go through
some of the technical things,

00:27:06.970 --> 00:27:10.420
the precision biomarker
qualification but it really means

00:27:10.420 --> 00:27:15.470 position:56%
that when you start to really-- and
this will be done by NCI and others,

00:27:15.470 --> 00:27:16.780
you really want to be able

00:27:16.780 --> 00:27:21.750
to understand specific genetic
mutations and really targets.

00:27:21.750 --> 00:27:24.730
Because, right, you know, we
used to treat breast cancer,

00:27:24.730 --> 00:27:26.740
we used to treat prostate cancer.

00:27:26.740 --> 00:27:28.360
Now we know it's all genetic.

00:27:28.360 --> 00:27:30.160
We know that these
targets are important

00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:31.960
and the disease is different.

00:27:31.960 --> 00:27:33.790
When we treated breast cancer, we--

00:27:33.790 --> 00:27:36.870
why would one survive
and one didn't?

00:27:36.870 --> 00:27:38.770
I mean, now those are
scientific issues

00:27:38.770 --> 00:27:40.260
that are going to be important.

00:27:40.260 --> 00:27:43.210
Accelerating drug development
is important.

00:27:43.210 --> 00:27:47.020
Also, the approval of drugs for
limited populations that really has

00:27:47.020 --> 00:27:49.690
to do more with the
antibiotic resistance,

00:27:49.690 --> 00:27:52.600
but we know that that's
really important.

00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:55.400
Keeping and recruiting the
brightest and the best.

00:27:55.400 --> 00:27:58.190
And I want to go through a few
other minor things before I turn it

00:27:58.190 --> 00:28:03.330 position:56%
over to my colleagues, who will give
you the specific recommendations

00:28:03.330 --> 00:28:05.410
of the Blue Ribbon.

00:28:05.410 --> 00:28:11.980
The-- Let's see what I have,
the streamlined data review,

00:28:11.980 --> 00:28:15.560
priority review for breakthrough
devices is really important

00:28:15.560 --> 00:28:21.940 position:56%
because the idea is right now, we
have genetic testing and we really--

00:28:21.940 --> 00:28:24.340
and we need to make sure
that's accurate and we want

00:28:24.340 --> 00:28:25.750
to make sure we get--

00:28:25.750 --> 00:28:28.680
that we understand how to
really diagnose people.

00:28:28.680 --> 00:28:32.480
Everyone focuses on the
drug and the treatment

00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:34.580
and not a lot on the diagnostic.

00:28:34.580 --> 00:28:37.470
But today, these genetic
panels and these assays

00:28:37.470 --> 00:28:42.030
that one uses is really
important in getting better ones

00:28:42.030 --> 00:28:45.670
that are more specific on
the market is important.

00:28:45.670 --> 00:28:50.460
So, just before I pass it over
to my wonderful colleagues,

00:28:50.460 --> 00:28:55.260
I do want to say that when we
were appointed and Dr. Singer was

00:28:55.260 --> 00:29:00.230
in charge of this, and we all
said, "How is this going to happen?

00:29:00.230 --> 00:29:05.170
How 26, 28 desperate people
going to come and advance cancer

00:29:05.170 --> 00:29:08.280
and give recommendations
in five, six months?

00:29:08.280 --> 00:29:12.970
And the goal of the Blue Ribbon
was really to create improvements

00:29:12.970 --> 00:29:15.500
that would have normally
taken 10 years in 5.

00:29:15.500 --> 00:29:18.760
And I think the first meeting
we were all scratching our head.

00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:22.390
And I think for Dr. Singer,
who is also very challenging

00:29:22.390 --> 00:29:24.220
and Dr. Lowy how we're
going to do this.

00:29:24.220 --> 00:29:26.780
But everyone came together.

00:29:26.780 --> 00:29:31.130
Everyone understood the importance
of the mission and the opportunity.

00:29:31.130 --> 00:29:34.850
And I'm very proud of the
report that was written

00:29:34.850 --> 00:29:37.990
and I know it will
profoundly impact patients.

00:29:37.990 --> 00:29:42.230
And, really, special, special
thanks for putting it together.

00:29:42.230 --> 00:29:44.630 position:56%
It was day, it was night, it was 7--

00:29:44.630 --> 00:29:48.170
24/7, but everyone
understood the urgency.

00:29:48.170 --> 00:29:52.340
And also this drug passed
overwhelmingly, you know,

00:29:52.340 --> 00:29:55.150
this bill in the House and
the Senate was bipartisan

00:29:55.150 --> 00:29:58.850
and in these days in Washington
where the environment is toxic,

00:29:58.850 --> 00:30:03.620
to really see the enthusiasm,
enthusiasm for this was wonderful.

00:30:03.620 --> 00:30:05.890
So, I'm very honored to be here.

00:30:05.890 --> 00:30:09.530
I'm inspired by you, Juanita,
and your incredible story.

00:30:09.530 --> 00:30:12.870
And keep on fighting and keep
on doing the right thing.

00:30:12.870 --> 00:30:15.750
And we were-- all trying very hard.

00:30:15.750 --> 00:30:17.550
Thank you.

00:30:17.550 --> 00:30:22.170
[ Applause ]

00:30:22.170 --> 00:30:25.820
&gt;&gt; Sandra Charles:
Thank you, Dr. Sigal.

00:30:25.820 --> 00:30:30.570
The next two panels who will come,
first, Dr. Singer, will come forth

00:30:30.570 --> 00:30:34.100
and she will give a broad
overview of the Moonshot Initiative

00:30:34.100 --> 00:30:36.700
and the panel recommendations.

00:30:36.700 --> 00:30:41.850
And then Dr. Lowy will highlight
certain specific recommendations

00:30:41.850 --> 00:30:45.400
relating to the various kinds of
research starting with the basic

00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:48.200
and then discussing implementation

00:30:48.200 --> 00:30:50.850
and how they relate to
the cancer patients.

00:30:50.850 --> 00:30:54.700
We have the bios of our
speakers in your program.

00:30:54.700 --> 00:30:59.630
And as I mentioned, just before
they came in, Dr. Singer is--

00:30:59.630 --> 00:31:02.070
she's the Director of the
Division of Cancer Biology

00:31:02.070 --> 00:31:05.160
at the National Cancer
Institute, which is a part

00:31:05.160 --> 00:31:07.380
of National Institutes of Health.

00:31:07.380 --> 00:31:12.510 position:56%
And since 1999, while simultaneously
serving as Senior Investigator

00:31:12.510 --> 00:31:15.550
and Chief of the Molecular
Regulation Section

00:31:15.550 --> 00:31:18.950
of the Experimental
Immunology Branch, she--

00:31:18.950 --> 00:31:22.070
position she's had since 1991.

00:31:22.070 --> 00:31:25.820
She's currently serving also
as Acting Deputy Director

00:31:25.820 --> 00:31:27.690
of National Cancer Institute.

00:31:27.690 --> 00:31:30.500
And you can see more
details in your program.

00:31:30.500 --> 00:31:35.170
Dr. Lowy is Acting Director of
the National Cancer Institute

00:31:35.170 --> 00:31:39.810
and also Chief of the intramural
Laboratory of Cellular Oncology

00:31:39.810 --> 00:31:43.190
in the Center for Cancer
Research there at NCI.

00:31:43.190 --> 00:31:49.410
And his medical degree
comes from NYU-- Yes, NYU.

00:31:49.410 --> 00:31:55.590 position:56%
And then his internal medicine
residence is at Stanford University.

00:31:55.590 --> 00:31:59.230
He also did a dermatology
residence at Yale University.

00:31:59.230 --> 00:32:01.710
And Stanford is one of those
places near and dear to me

00:32:01.710 --> 00:32:06.080
as I have two daughters
who are alumna.

00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:10.880
So, I really look forward to
hearing from, first, Dr. Singer

00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:15.220
and then Dr. Lowy, about the
actual Moonshot Initiative.

00:32:15.220 --> 00:32:21.340
Please come.

00:32:21.340 --> 00:32:22.640
&gt;&gt; Dinah Singer: Well, thank you.

00:32:22.640 --> 00:32:23.940
I'm delighted to be here.

00:32:23.940 --> 00:32:25.600
Despite our somewhat late arrival,

00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:28.060
we did get a scenic
tour of the library.

00:32:28.060 --> 00:32:31.990 position:56%
A little bit rushed but we're hoping
to come back for a longer tour.

00:32:31.990 --> 00:32:36.620 position:56%
I would like to also thank Dr.
Charles for organizing this meeting,

00:32:36.620 --> 00:32:39.870
giving us the opportunity to
tell you about the Moonshot.

00:32:39.870 --> 00:32:41.860
But before I start, I do want

00:32:41.860 --> 00:32:44.200
to particularly acknowledge
Ellen Sigal,

00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:47.360
because without her
tireless efforts,

00:32:47.360 --> 00:32:49.380
the Cures Act would
have never happened,

00:32:49.380 --> 00:32:51.130
the Moonshot would
have never happen.

00:32:51.130 --> 00:32:55.510
And we're all very indebted to you,
so a round of applause for Ellen.

00:32:55.510 --> 00:32:59.530
[ Applause ]

00:32:59.530 --> 00:33:02.840
So now that the Cures
Act has passed,

00:33:02.840 --> 00:33:08.190
what I would like to do is
give you a very brief overview

00:33:08.190 --> 00:33:12.100
of the scientific components
of the Cancer Moonshot.

00:33:12.100 --> 00:33:16.000
As Ellen pointed our, the
Cures Act encompasses more

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:17.640
than just the cancer research.

00:33:17.640 --> 00:33:21.510
And in fact, the Moonshot
encompasses more than the science

00:33:21.510 --> 00:33:24.290
but what I'm going to
focus on is the science.

00:33:24.290 --> 00:33:29.210
So, the Moonshot actually
was launched, if you will,

00:33:29.210 --> 00:33:33.550
during President Obama's last
State of the Union Address,

00:33:33.550 --> 00:33:39.220
when he announced a Cancer
Moonshot effort and follow that up

00:33:39.220 --> 00:33:44.010 position:56%
with an official presidential memo
that outlined what that Moonshot was

00:33:44.010 --> 00:33:46.440
and what it was intended
to accomplish.

00:33:46.440 --> 00:33:51.650 position:56%
I've summarized the main points here
on this slide, which is, number one,

00:33:51.650 --> 00:33:57.240
to accelerate progress in cancer
including prevention and screening

00:33:57.240 --> 00:34:02.140
and expanding the gamut of research
from basic research all the way

00:34:02.140 --> 00:34:05.350
up through standard of care.

00:34:05.350 --> 00:34:08.720
Second main area was to
encourage greater cooperation

00:34:08.720 --> 00:34:13.290
and collaboration across
the entire cancer community

00:34:13.290 --> 00:34:16.150
and to enhance data sharing.

00:34:16.150 --> 00:34:20.070
So, the effort, really,
was instantiated

00:34:20.070 --> 00:34:22.790
through a federal taskforce,

00:34:22.790 --> 00:34:25.650
which is run out of the
Vice President's office

00:34:25.650 --> 00:34:29.810
with the Vice President as Chair
of the taskforce that consist

00:34:29.810 --> 00:34:33.050
of the heads of all of the
agencies in the government

00:34:33.050 --> 00:34:38.840
that do anything associated with
cancer and including the heads

00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:44.370
of NCI in this case, Dr.
Lowy, and NIH, Dr. Collins.

00:34:44.370 --> 00:34:49.550
And within the presidential memo,
the NCI and its advisory broad,

00:34:49.550 --> 00:34:53.750
the National Cancer Advisory
Board, were specifically tasked

00:34:53.750 --> 00:34:56.740
with organizing a Blue Ribbon Panel

00:34:56.740 --> 00:35:00.180
that would advice the
Moonshot effort

00:35:00.180 --> 00:35:03.480
as to the scientific opportunities.

00:35:03.480 --> 00:35:08.680
So, the specific charge in
the presidential memo was

00:35:08.680 --> 00:35:13.770 position:56%
that a Blue Ribbon Panel be
established to provide expert advice

00:35:13.770 --> 00:35:16.900
on the vision, proposed
scientific goals,

00:35:16.900 --> 00:35:20.400
and implementation of
the Cancer Moonshot.

00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:26.580
And it was also charged with
providing an intensive examination

00:35:26.580 --> 00:35:30.880
of the opportunities and
impediments in cancer research.

00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:34.400
What the memo didn't say, but
Ellen alluded to, was that we had

00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:39.010
to do all that in five months.

00:35:39.010 --> 00:35:42.100
The panel itself had 28 members.

00:35:42.100 --> 00:35:45.660
The members really
represented, again,

00:35:45.660 --> 00:35:50.130
a spectrum of the cancer
community and included clinicians,

00:35:50.130 --> 00:35:54.540
researchers, advocates, Ellen
was among them, representatives

00:35:54.540 --> 00:35:58.510
from Pharma, from the IT
community, from the private sector,

00:35:58.510 --> 00:36:03.240
and the panel itself had
three face-to-face meetings

00:36:03.240 --> 00:36:06.610
to identify the areas
that we would focus

00:36:06.610 --> 00:36:11.540
on to consider the recommendations
and then to finalize what would be

00:36:11.540 --> 00:36:14.150
in the report that would be sent

00:36:14.150 --> 00:36:16.810
to the task force and
the vice president.

00:36:16.810 --> 00:36:22.300
In order to accomplish that, seven
working groups were organized.

00:36:22.300 --> 00:36:25.810
Each of the working groups
was co-chaired by two members

00:36:25.810 --> 00:36:28.540
of the Blue Ribbon Panel,
so we had good continuity

00:36:28.540 --> 00:36:31.480
between the panel itself
and the working groups.

00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:37.280
And those areas of investigation
were clinical trails, data sharing,

00:36:37.280 --> 00:36:42.810
cancer immunology, tumor
evolution, implementation science,

00:36:42.810 --> 00:36:47.620
pediatric cancer, precession
prevention, and early detection.

00:36:47.620 --> 00:36:51.060
So the entire span of
cancer with the goal

00:36:51.060 --> 00:36:55.490
of identifying those research
opportunities and each

00:36:55.490 --> 00:36:58.650
of those areas that were
poised to be accelerated.

00:36:58.650 --> 00:37:03.250
Because as Ellen pointed out, the
goal here is to try to accomplish

00:37:03.250 --> 00:37:06.450
in 5 years what would
normally take 10.

00:37:06.450 --> 00:37:09.590
So to really specifically
find to that segment

00:37:09.590 --> 00:37:15.660 position:56%
of the entire cancer research
portfolio, that could be accelerated

00:37:15.660 --> 00:37:18.510
with the additional funds
that would be coming

00:37:18.510 --> 00:37:21.350
for research through the Cures Act.

00:37:21.350 --> 00:37:27.310
The working groups met weekly--
each of the groups met every week

00:37:27.310 --> 00:37:31.450
to discuss-- first, to identify
those areas within their topic

00:37:31.450 --> 00:37:35.680
and then to really discuss
which ones were the best poise

00:37:35.680 --> 00:37:38.760
to be accelerated and then
to finally generate two

00:37:38.760 --> 00:37:41.610
to three recommendations
for consideration

00:37:41.610 --> 00:37:45.580
by the Blue Ribbon Panel.

00:37:45.580 --> 00:37:49.630
In addition, because all there
are 28 people and 7 working groups

00:37:49.630 --> 00:37:54.270
with a total of about a 150
people involved sounds like a lot,

00:37:54.270 --> 00:37:57.700
it's really only a fraction
of the whole cancer community.

00:37:57.700 --> 00:38:01.200
So we wanted to also have
outreach activities to let anyone

00:38:01.200 --> 00:38:04.200
who had an idea submitted.

00:38:04.200 --> 00:38:08.910
And so we had a variety of ways in
which people could submit ideas.

00:38:08.910 --> 00:38:11.990
The major one was a website

00:38:11.990 --> 00:38:15.730
where people could go
and submit their ideas.

00:38:15.730 --> 00:38:20.450
We also had so-called listening
sessions at some large conferences.

00:38:20.450 --> 00:38:26.470
And in the end we had over
1,600 ideas that were submitted.

00:38:26.470 --> 00:38:29.700
Each one of them was
actually read and considered,

00:38:29.700 --> 00:38:34.340
and in a gratifying way all of the
ideas that we received were ones

00:38:34.340 --> 00:38:37.010
that had been touched upon
by one of the working groups.

00:38:37.010 --> 00:38:39.010
So we felt pretty confident

00:38:39.010 --> 00:38:43.370
that we had covered everything
that could be covered.

00:38:43.370 --> 00:38:48.720
So, in the end, we had a
total of 13 recommendations.

00:38:48.720 --> 00:38:53.020
They were summarized in the
report in 10 recommendations.

00:38:53.020 --> 00:38:55.720
There was some overlap
in the recommendations.

00:38:55.720 --> 00:39:01.750
And those recommendations identify
exceptional research opportunities

00:39:01.750 --> 00:39:04.050
that are poised to be accelerated

00:39:04.050 --> 00:39:08.430
and could powerfully advance
our understanding of cancer.

00:39:08.430 --> 00:39:11.890
And you can read the report in
its entirety at that website.

00:39:11.890 --> 00:39:15.730
I've also noted the website at the
bottom of every slide if you want

00:39:15.730 --> 00:39:18.230
to jot it down and take a
look at the report later.

00:39:18.230 --> 00:39:20.200
I could have the next slide.

00:39:20.200 --> 00:39:23.360 position:56%
There were a number of cross-cutting
themes that were identified

00:39:23.360 --> 00:39:26.440
that coursed through all
of the recommendations,

00:39:26.440 --> 00:39:30.630
prominent among them was
health disparities research.

00:39:30.630 --> 00:39:34.150
There was also a clear interest
in developing a national network

00:39:34.150 --> 00:39:37.030
of patient biological
and clinical data,

00:39:37.030 --> 00:39:41.560
so that we could amass more
data about each of the cancers

00:39:41.560 --> 00:39:44.250
to really learn more
about it in depth.

00:39:44.250 --> 00:39:48.170
Prevention, development of
biomarkers and new technologies,

00:39:48.170 --> 00:39:52.170 position:56%
was cited in many of the
recommendations as with data sharing

00:39:52.170 --> 00:39:55.090
and the need to develop
computational models.

00:39:55.090 --> 00:39:58.980
And finally and importantly,
the need to collaborate

00:39:58.980 --> 00:40:02.090
across all the sectors was
highlighted as essential

00:40:02.090 --> 00:40:05.040
for really advancing
our understanding.

00:40:05.040 --> 00:40:09.180
In the next few slides, I'm
going to very briefly touch

00:40:09.180 --> 00:40:13.980
on the 10 recommendations that
are summarized in the report just

00:40:13.980 --> 00:40:17.450
so you have a sense of the
flavor of each of them.

00:40:17.450 --> 00:40:21.360
I'll note that the
recommendations are listed

00:40:21.360 --> 00:40:24.470
in alphabetical order, if you will.

00:40:24.470 --> 00:40:26.560
We didn't want to assign
numbers to them

00:40:26.560 --> 00:40:29.630
to give any implication
of prioritization.

00:40:29.630 --> 00:40:32.190
The way that recommendations
were developed,

00:40:32.190 --> 00:40:35.900
they're all high priority
and of equal priority.

00:40:35.900 --> 00:40:40.530
So, A, is the network for
direct patient engagement.

00:40:40.530 --> 00:40:46.860
The idea is to allow any patient
anywhere to be able to engage

00:40:46.860 --> 00:40:50.730
with the research community
through a network,

00:40:50.730 --> 00:40:54.970 position:56%
and that they could then
pre-register for any clinical trials

00:40:54.970 --> 00:40:56.590
that might become available.

00:40:56.590 --> 00:41:00.480
Cancer immunotherapy,
translational science network,

00:41:00.480 --> 00:41:06.060 position:56%
I think we've all heard about the
huge promise of cancer immunotherapy

00:41:06.060 --> 00:41:07.380
but we have a lot to learn.

00:41:07.380 --> 00:41:12.140
And so this network is designed to
give us insights into such things

00:41:12.140 --> 00:41:16.360
as why do many patients
quickly develop resistance

00:41:16.360 --> 00:41:19.260
or not respond at all.

00:41:19.260 --> 00:41:23.970
Leading to the next topic which
is to identify the mechanisms

00:41:23.970 --> 00:41:29.320 position:56%
of therapeutic resistance so that we
can predict who is going to respond

00:41:29.320 --> 00:41:31.840
and who is going to be resistant.

00:41:31.840 --> 00:41:35.680
Creation of a national cancer data
ecosystem, as I think you've heard

00:41:35.680 --> 00:41:40.110
from Vice President Biden, data
sharing is of utmost importance

00:41:40.110 --> 00:41:45.060
and the goal here is really to link
everybody and all the data sets.

00:41:45.060 --> 00:41:50.300
And importantly, allow patient
access to those data as well.

00:41:50.300 --> 00:41:55.320 position:56%
So the patients will be an important
component of that ecosystem.

00:41:55.320 --> 00:42:00.190
A huge emphasis on pediatric
cancer, which is very different

00:42:00.190 --> 00:42:04.820
from adult cancer, so a focus
on the specific kinds of tumors

00:42:04.820 --> 00:42:09.000
and abnormal proteins that are
generated in pediatric cancer.

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:14.230
And I think Ms. Lyle referred to
this a real interest in trying

00:42:14.230 --> 00:42:19.120
to understand the symptoms that
develop as a result of the therapy

00:42:19.120 --> 00:42:21.600
and how do we manage them
and how do we support them.

00:42:21.600 --> 00:42:25.670
And finally, precision,
prevention, and early detection,

00:42:25.670 --> 00:42:30.270
obviously if we can prevent cancer,
we're much better off than having

00:42:30.270 --> 00:42:32.860
to treat it and therefore
we need to also be able

00:42:32.860 --> 00:42:35.210
to detect it very early on.

00:42:35.210 --> 00:42:39.670
The last three, we can learn

00:42:39.670 --> 00:42:42.450
from patients who've
already been treated.

00:42:42.450 --> 00:42:47.150
We can try to really probe
in depth the biospecimens

00:42:47.150 --> 00:42:51.180
that we've collected to begin
to understand who responds

00:42:51.180 --> 00:42:52.520
to therapy and who doesn't.

00:42:52.520 --> 00:42:54.720
I alluded to that in
terms of immunotherapy

00:42:54.720 --> 00:42:58.270
but we can do it much more
broadly for all types of therapy.

00:42:58.270 --> 00:43:01.410
Finally, creation of a tumor atlas.

00:43:01.410 --> 00:43:05.160
To understand in depth
the molecular and cellular

00:43:05.160 --> 00:43:11.050
and architectural components of
a tumor from the earliest stages

00:43:11.050 --> 00:43:14.690
through to a frank tumor, through
their resistance to metastasis,

00:43:14.690 --> 00:43:19.180
so that at each stage we might
be able to predict how it's going

00:43:19.180 --> 00:43:22.610
to proceed and how it
will respond to therapy.

00:43:22.610 --> 00:43:26.370
And finally, again, importantly
in almost everything we do,

00:43:26.370 --> 00:43:29.530
the development of new
enabling technologies.

00:43:29.530 --> 00:43:35.360
So what are the next steps now
that the Cures Act is passed?

00:43:35.360 --> 00:43:39.870
The reports both from the Blue
Ribbon Panel and the Task Force,

00:43:39.870 --> 00:43:43.690
the overarching body,
were released in October.

00:43:43.690 --> 00:43:46.160
And I'll give you a
very quick summary

00:43:46.160 --> 00:43:48.530
of the Task Force report
in a minute.

00:43:48.530 --> 00:43:52.560
We're beginning to
implement the recommendations.

00:43:52.560 --> 00:43:57.860 position:56%
We're starting to launch those that
are feasible to do this fiscal year,

00:43:57.860 --> 00:44:02.480 position:56%
and then for succeeding fiscal years
we'll look to our advisory boards

00:44:02.480 --> 00:44:05.420
and outside advisors
to really identify how

00:44:05.420 --> 00:44:08.750
to best proceed with
the implementation.

00:44:08.750 --> 00:44:12.280
Of course we're going to establish
public-private partnerships,

00:44:12.280 --> 00:44:16.750
to help us with this, what we've
outlined exceeds what anybody could

00:44:16.750 --> 00:44:20.680
give us and so we need to
partner with other agencies

00:44:20.680 --> 00:44:22.880
and with the private sector.

00:44:22.880 --> 00:44:26.520 position:56%
And philosophically, it's something
we feel as important to do to engage

00:44:26.520 --> 00:44:28.920
as much of the community as we can.

00:44:28.920 --> 00:44:33.490
And I should point out, and I know
Dr. Lowy will probably also want

00:44:33.490 --> 00:44:36.390
to point this out, that even
though we're putting huge emphasis

00:44:36.390 --> 00:44:39.830
on this segment of our
research portfolio,

00:44:39.830 --> 00:44:44.190
all the other research needs
to continue to be supported,

00:44:44.190 --> 00:44:47.500
young investigators need to be
supported, and so we are going

00:44:47.500 --> 00:44:51.230
to be conscientious in paying
attention to those components

00:44:51.230 --> 00:44:54.100
of cancer research
that are not identified

00:44:54.100 --> 00:44:56.490
in the Blue Ribbon report.

00:44:56.490 --> 00:45:01.290
Quickly, the Task Force identified
a number of strategic goals

00:45:01.290 --> 00:45:05.870
in its report catalyzing new
scientific breakthroughs.

00:45:05.870 --> 00:45:11.490 position:56%
Their focus was on the technology
expanding mobile devices, et cetera.

00:45:11.490 --> 00:45:14.960
Data sharing, bringing
new therapies to patients

00:45:14.960 --> 00:45:18.870
in this case really focusing
much more on clinical trials

00:45:18.870 --> 00:45:24.040
and eligibility then was cited
in the Blue Ribbon Panel report.

00:45:24.040 --> 00:45:26.350
Strengthening prevention
and diagnosis

00:45:26.350 --> 00:45:29.950
and importantly improving
patient access and care.

00:45:29.950 --> 00:45:33.150
So I think between
the Task Force report

00:45:33.150 --> 00:45:35.050
and the Blue Ribbon Panel report,

00:45:35.050 --> 00:45:40.760
we've really covered the entire
spectrum of cancer research

00:45:40.760 --> 00:45:44.600
and treatment and patient
engagement.

00:45:44.600 --> 00:45:51.050
And I'll end simply by
thanking Ms. Lyle for giving us

00:45:51.050 --> 00:45:55.170
such a moving account of
her journey through cancer.

00:45:55.170 --> 00:45:56.590
And everything we're doing

00:45:56.590 --> 00:46:00.940
through the Moonshot is really
benefit patients like Ms. Lyle,

00:46:00.940 --> 00:46:06.490 position:56%
her sister, and everybody else who's
been touched by cancer and to try

00:46:06.490 --> 00:46:08.410
to prevent others from
going through that.

00:46:08.410 --> 00:46:10.510
So thank you.

00:46:10.510 --> 00:46:16.000
[ Applause ]

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:17.340
&gt;&gt; Douglas Lowy: Good afternoon.

00:46:17.340 --> 00:46:18.640
I'm Doug Lowy.

00:46:18.640 --> 00:46:22.660
I'm the Acting Director of
the National Cancer Institute.

00:46:22.660 --> 00:46:28.510
And I first want to say that it
really is extraordinary for us

00:46:28.510 --> 00:46:32.330
to be here in the Library
of Congress, because I think

00:46:32.330 --> 00:46:36.630
of the Library of Congress as
the place that is the storehouse

00:46:36.630 --> 00:46:42.760
of accumulated knowledge for not
just the United States but also

00:46:42.760 --> 00:46:47.090
for the world and its
continued accumulation.

00:46:47.090 --> 00:46:50.590
And what I think that
we're going to--

00:46:50.590 --> 00:46:53.540
what we're talking about is what--

00:46:53.540 --> 00:46:59.860
where we have been and where
we are and where we hope to go.

00:46:59.860 --> 00:47:05.760
It's extraordinary for those of
us in cancer research to see how

00:47:05.760 --> 00:47:08.300
in many ways we are favored.

00:47:08.300 --> 00:47:14.630
And in terms of the president
of the United States, last year,

00:47:14.630 --> 00:47:19.210
having a precision medicine
initiative in oncology, this year,

00:47:19.210 --> 00:47:28.150
the Cancer Moonshot, and really
the overall goals are paradoxically

00:47:28.150 --> 00:47:34.160 position:56%
simultaneously so that there will
be more Juanita Lyles because people

00:47:34.160 --> 00:47:37.450
who get cancer, more
of them will do better.

00:47:37.450 --> 00:47:40.970
But on the other hand, there
will be fewer Juanita Lyles

00:47:40.970 --> 00:47:44.050
because there'll be fewer
people getting cancer.

00:47:44.050 --> 00:47:48.670
And that really is
what this is about.

00:47:48.670 --> 00:47:51.500
I have, I think, a
total of eight slides.

00:47:51.500 --> 00:47:55.180
The first four are really
kind of trying to set

00:47:55.180 --> 00:48:03.930
for you some understanding and
rationale of why cancer, why now.

00:48:03.930 --> 00:48:09.580
And the first slide shows what
has happened to mortality rates

00:48:09.580 --> 00:48:12.600
since the mid '90s for cancer.

00:48:12.600 --> 00:48:14.800
And this is cancer in general.

00:48:14.800 --> 00:48:19.380
Men are in blue on top because they
have the highest mortality rates,

00:48:19.380 --> 00:48:22.770
women are in black on the bottom,

00:48:22.770 --> 00:48:25.780
and both genders together
are in red.

00:48:25.780 --> 00:48:30.860
And what I would like you to see
is, number one, mortality rate

00:48:30.860 --> 00:48:36.900
in general, going down, and if
you compare the rate of decrease

00:48:36.900 --> 00:48:40.700
of the most recent 10-year
period for which we have data,

00:48:40.700 --> 00:48:45.270
it is going to down faster
than the rate of decrease

00:48:45.270 --> 00:48:50.410
for the next earlier 10 years.

00:48:50.410 --> 00:48:52.260
Next slide, please.

00:48:52.260 --> 00:48:58.820
What this slide depicts for
you is that it is most cancers.

00:48:58.820 --> 00:49:03.450 position:56%
It's not just people are smoking
less and so we have less one cancer,

00:49:03.450 --> 00:49:08.250
and that accounts for the major
change in mortality rates.

00:49:08.250 --> 00:49:09.840
It is important.

00:49:09.840 --> 00:49:18.080
But what's shown here is in the
blue, the decreased percentage

00:49:18.080 --> 00:49:23.780
of mortality over the last 10
years for which we have data.

00:49:23.780 --> 00:49:28.670
And you can see on the left
is men, on the right is women.

00:49:28.670 --> 00:49:35.870
And in red are those cancers whose
mortality rates are going up.

00:49:35.870 --> 00:49:39.230
And so we need to pay
a special attention

00:49:39.230 --> 00:49:41.150
to those that are going up.

00:49:41.150 --> 00:49:45.800
But before I talk briefly
about one of them,

00:49:45.800 --> 00:49:51.370
note that this is attributable
to decreases in the majority

00:49:51.370 --> 00:49:54.140
of the most common cancers.

00:49:54.140 --> 00:50:00.240 position:56%
And that this decrease we think will
continue and we want it if anything

00:50:00.240 --> 00:50:06.740
to accelerate as a result
of the Cancer Moonshot.

00:50:06.740 --> 00:50:12.000
So, let me call your attention
to the one that is increasing

00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:17.010
for liver cancer both
for men and for women.

00:50:17.010 --> 00:50:22.830
A large problem of this is
an increase in the incidence

00:50:22.830 --> 00:50:29.230 position:56%
and prevalence of hepatitis C virus
infection, which is actually related

00:50:29.230 --> 00:50:36.310
to opioid epidemic and
other kinds of drug use.

00:50:36.310 --> 00:50:42.480
As Dr. Sigal pointed out, the
opioid epidemic is front and center

00:50:42.480 --> 00:50:44.820
with the 21st Century Cures.

00:50:44.820 --> 00:50:48.330
But mortality rates from
hepatitis C virus infection

00:50:48.330 --> 00:50:52.180
in the United States are
now almost twice as high

00:50:52.180 --> 00:50:56.120
as mortality rates
from HIV infection.

00:50:56.120 --> 00:50:59.950
And the prediction is that
over the next 15 years

00:50:59.950 --> 00:51:06.400 position:56%
that the mortality rates will more
than double and come close to triple

00:51:06.400 --> 00:51:10.150
from this infection
in the United States.

00:51:10.150 --> 00:51:14.400 position:56%
And so, one of the things that we're
going to try to do is to intervene

00:51:14.400 --> 00:51:19.650
to reduce mortality rates before
people develop liver cancer,

00:51:19.650 --> 00:51:25.130
before they develop cirrhosis,
before they develop liver failure.

00:51:25.130 --> 00:51:26.910
Next slide.

00:51:26.910 --> 00:51:30.840
You may have seen this
front page article last week

00:51:30.840 --> 00:51:36.400
from Lenny Bernstein who's talking
about life expectancy declining

00:51:36.400 --> 00:51:39.220
for the first time since 1993.

00:51:39.220 --> 00:51:43.450
And these are from the
most recent data from 2015,

00:51:43.450 --> 00:51:47.810
the data that I have shown
you or the detailed analysis

00:51:47.810 --> 00:51:51.570
that we have done through 2014.

00:51:51.570 --> 00:51:55.160
And 8 of the most common--
of the 10 most common causes,

00:51:55.160 --> 00:52:00.030
the mortality rates went up, the
ninth was essentially stable.

00:52:00.030 --> 00:52:06.150
But the 10th, what I've
highlighted in blue,

00:52:06.150 --> 00:52:09.220
is that the report's lone
bright spot was a drop

00:52:09.220 --> 00:52:11.000
in death rate from cancer.

00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:15.200
So, the death rates from
cancer have continued even

00:52:15.200 --> 00:52:20.900
with the most recent data, and
despite other common causes

00:52:20.900 --> 00:52:23.040
of death having increased.

00:52:23.040 --> 00:52:24.340
Next slide.

00:52:24.340 --> 00:52:28.760
So, I think this-- I see this as
a kind of a lead in "why now?"

00:52:28.760 --> 00:52:30.500
for the Cancer Moonshot.

00:52:30.500 --> 00:52:33.970
The need has been present for
decades but it's now matched

00:52:33.970 --> 00:52:36.590
by the opportunity
to be able to benefit

00:52:36.590 --> 00:52:40.470
from a major infusion
of additional resources.

00:52:40.470 --> 00:52:45.080
And you heard from Ellen
and also from Dinah

00:52:45.080 --> 00:52:49.320
about these opportunities.

00:52:49.320 --> 00:52:53.770
In some-- I mean, obviously, many--
too many people die from cancer.

00:52:53.770 --> 00:52:56.080
About one and a half
million get cancer,

00:52:56.080 --> 00:53:00.470
about 600,000 died
from cancer each year.

00:53:00.470 --> 00:53:04.640
But as you can see from the
decreasing mortality rates,

00:53:04.640 --> 00:53:06.740
we are doing better.

00:53:06.740 --> 00:53:09.810
And it's at a time when you're
doing better and it's not just

00:53:09.810 --> 00:53:13.030
for one disease, it's not just
prevention, not just screening,

00:53:13.030 --> 00:53:16.080
not just treatment but it's
a combination of those.

00:53:16.080 --> 00:53:21.190
That's the time when an increase
in investment is most likely

00:53:21.190 --> 00:53:26.550 position:56%
to yield results that are
beneficial for patient's prevention,

00:53:26.550 --> 00:53:28.580
screening, and treatment.

00:53:28.580 --> 00:53:32.680
Another reason is that
immunotherapy has come of age.

00:53:32.680 --> 00:53:37.420
And I think that we've all been
really impressed to see people

00:53:37.420 --> 00:53:43.100
such as President Carter who had
metastatic melanoma to his brain

00:53:43.100 --> 00:53:48.270
and was able to go about his
business and get a check--

00:53:48.270 --> 00:53:55.150
an immune checkpoint inhibitor
and he is now cancer-free

00:53:55.150 --> 00:53:58.060
and building houses for
Habitat for Humanity just

00:53:58.060 --> 00:54:00.010
like any 91-year-old
person would be doing.

00:54:00.010 --> 00:54:01.330
[ Laughter ]

00:54:01.330 --> 00:54:06.280
So the next slide basically depicts

00:54:06.280 --> 00:54:14.050
for you diagrammatically how
we view the Moonshot itself.

00:54:14.050 --> 00:54:17.810
Where in purple, there
is a lot of research.

00:54:17.810 --> 00:54:23.260 position:56%
We've come to this point as a result
of research that has been conducted.

00:54:23.260 --> 00:54:26.220
But the Blue Ribbon Panel
really looked at issues,

00:54:26.220 --> 00:54:30.750
what's poised for acceleration,
and that's shown in the blue part.

00:54:30.750 --> 00:54:32.560
Next slide.

00:54:32.560 --> 00:54:36.610
And Dinah has already gone over
some of them but I just want

00:54:36.610 --> 00:54:39.710
to highlight two of them for you.

00:54:39.710 --> 00:54:42.310
The so-called tumor cell atlas.

00:54:42.310 --> 00:54:46.450
We had a signature program over
the last 10 years called the Cancer

00:54:46.450 --> 00:54:51.490
Genome Atlas that was funded
both by the NCI as well

00:54:51.490 --> 00:54:53.950 position:56%
as by the Genome Research Institute.

00:54:53.950 --> 00:54:58.080
And there are three important ways
where technological developments

00:54:58.080 --> 00:55:02.590
over the last decade means
that we can learn even more

00:55:02.590 --> 00:55:08.380 position:56%
about the details of how cancer
comes about than we could from TCGA.

00:55:08.380 --> 00:55:10.930
And we think that this will--

00:55:10.930 --> 00:55:15.590
this understanding will help us in
prevention screening and treatment.

00:55:15.590 --> 00:55:19.420
So, we're going to try to look at
the three-dimensional organization

00:55:19.420 --> 00:55:21.320
of what's called the
micro environment.

00:55:21.320 --> 00:55:26.150
That is not just the tumor but also
the cells that surround the tumor;

00:55:26.150 --> 00:55:29.300
the cells of the immune
system, for example.

00:55:29.300 --> 00:55:32.080
The technology also now enables us

00:55:32.080 --> 00:55:35.690
to do detailed analysis
of very small lesions.

00:55:35.690 --> 00:55:38.680
That was not possible 10 years ago.

00:55:38.680 --> 00:55:41.820
So we can look premalignant
lesions in ways

00:55:41.820 --> 00:55:44.640
that have never been
examined before.

00:55:44.640 --> 00:55:49.360 position:56%
And by looking sequentially over
time, we can look at the progression

00:55:49.360 --> 00:55:55.710
and evolution of the tumor from
its earliest point to most advance.

00:55:55.710 --> 00:55:59.410
Dinah mentioned pediatric
cancer, and I'm just going

00:55:59.410 --> 00:56:03.400
to mention one aspect which
is fusion oncoproteins.

00:56:03.400 --> 00:56:08.060 position:56%
And those are proteins that are
rearranged that don't occur normally

00:56:08.060 --> 00:56:12.220
but occur in a fairly large
number of children with cancer,

00:56:12.220 --> 00:56:14.300
but they're different
rearranged proteins

00:56:14.300 --> 00:56:17.390
for different kinds of cancers.

00:56:17.390 --> 00:56:21.030
This is a difficult
thing to do but--

00:56:21.030 --> 00:56:25.310
and there is not much
financial incentive

00:56:25.310 --> 00:56:30.030
for the pharmaceutical industry,
biotech, to do it but we are--

00:56:30.030 --> 00:56:36.710
we already have announced an
effort to ask our investigators

00:56:36.710 --> 00:56:39.680
to make proposals for
how to make such--

00:56:39.680 --> 00:56:43.490
to make inhibitors against
such fusion oncoproteins,

00:56:43.490 --> 00:56:45.850
because we think that
in many instances,

00:56:45.850 --> 00:56:51.920
they actually are important
drivers of the cancers in children.

00:56:51.920 --> 00:56:57.480
Immunotherapy is really front and
center among the recommendations.

00:56:57.480 --> 00:57:01.900 position:56%
But Dr. Weiner is going to-- this is
his area of research and he is going

00:57:01.900 --> 00:57:04.910 position:56%
to talk a bit about what's happening

00:57:04.910 --> 00:57:11.280
and what the opportunities
are in immunotherapy.

00:57:11.280 --> 00:57:13.690
And I would point out
that in addition

00:57:13.690 --> 00:57:17.410
to our being extraordinarily
fortunate to have Ellen

00:57:17.410 --> 00:57:21.400
on the Blue Ribbon Panel,
because having patient advocates

00:57:21.400 --> 00:57:24.540
on the panel make sure that
the recommendations were going

00:57:24.540 --> 00:57:26.010
to be patient-centric.

00:57:26.010 --> 00:57:29.790
But in addition, we had people
from the pharmaceutical industry,

00:57:29.790 --> 00:57:34.650
people from academia
who do immunotherapy

00:57:34.650 --> 00:57:38.390
and make recommendations for
us so that we're not competing

00:57:38.390 --> 00:57:41.160
with the pharmaceutical
industry, we're not competing

00:57:41.160 --> 00:57:44.780
with private philanthropy
trying to develop immunotherapy,

00:57:44.780 --> 00:57:48.470
but instead are doing
supporting activities

00:57:48.470 --> 00:57:55.770
that complement what they do or
are distinct from what they do.

00:57:55.770 --> 00:57:57.070
Next slide.

00:57:57.070 --> 00:58:01.580
The last part is really
especially for Dr. Charles,

00:58:01.580 --> 00:58:06.000
because prevention really
is front and center.

00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:10.150
And as Dinah mentioned, cancer
health disparities which we view

00:58:10.150 --> 00:58:14.830
as racial, socio-economic,
and demographic,

00:58:14.830 --> 00:58:20.790 position:56%
and many of the proposals of-- in
the implementation part are designed

00:58:20.790 --> 00:58:26.760
to decrease the incidents
of cancer or to have people

00:58:26.760 --> 00:58:29.050
who get cancer have
a better outcome.

00:58:29.050 --> 00:58:31.260
And because of time,
I'm just going to focus

00:58:31.260 --> 00:58:34.100
on colorectal cancer screening.

00:58:34.100 --> 00:58:36.630
Why colorectal cancer screening?

00:58:36.630 --> 00:58:39.530
Two reasons, need and opportunity.

00:58:39.530 --> 00:58:44.140
The need is that this is one of
the most common causes of death

00:58:44.140 --> 00:58:46.640
from cancer in the United States,

00:58:46.640 --> 00:58:50.580
about 50,000 people die
of colorectal cancer.

00:58:50.580 --> 00:58:52.590
What's the opportunity?

00:58:52.590 --> 00:58:57.140
We've improved treatment to a
great degree but we also know

00:58:57.140 --> 00:59:01.830
that colorectal cancer screening
actually can decrease the incidents

00:59:01.830 --> 00:59:04.870
of this cancer and
decrease mortality.

00:59:04.870 --> 00:59:11.000
The problem is that it is an
underutilized effort for screening.

00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:15.030 position:56%
There's a lot more publicity, for
example, for breast cancer screening

00:59:15.030 --> 00:59:19.210
but the opportunities to
save lives in the short-term

00:59:19.210 --> 00:59:21.170
from increased uptake

00:59:21.170 --> 00:59:26.720
of high quality colorectal cancer
screening are simply extraordinary.

00:59:26.720 --> 00:59:31.950
So, I will stop there and I
really appreciate the opportunity

00:59:31.950 --> 00:59:33.750
of talking with you.

00:59:33.750 --> 00:59:38.410
[ Applause ]

00:59:38.410 --> 00:59:41.370
&gt;&gt; Sandra Charles: Thank
you Dr. Singer and Lowy.

00:59:41.370 --> 00:59:44.860
I think by now everyone is
getting a really clear picture

00:59:44.860 --> 00:59:49.700
of why we are having this panel
and how much promise there is

00:59:49.700 --> 00:59:53.670
in the future both for us and
for the community at large.

00:59:53.670 --> 00:59:57.200
And I think this is just wonderful.

00:59:57.200 --> 00:59:59.820
Are we loading-- You're done.

00:59:59.820 --> 01:00:01.120
Dr. Weiner's slides.

01:00:01.120 --> 01:00:02.740
[ Laughter ]

01:00:02.740 --> 01:00:05.400
We have loaded Dr. Weiner slides.

01:00:05.400 --> 01:00:12.830 position:56%
And I'm sure he was happy to hear
Dr. Lowy say, immunotherapy has come

01:00:12.830 --> 01:00:16.750
of age, because that is
his area of expertise

01:00:16.750 --> 01:00:19.400 position:56%
that is focused there at Georgetown.

01:00:19.400 --> 01:00:24.910
And again, Dr. Weiner
has been an integral part

01:00:24.910 --> 01:00:27.800
of this panel and effort.

01:00:27.800 --> 01:00:32.810 position:56%
He is the Director of Georgetown's
Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center

01:00:32.810 --> 01:00:35.540
and holds many distinctions
of Francis

01:00:35.540 --> 01:00:39.950
and Charlotte Gragnani Chair,
a professor of oncology

01:00:39.950 --> 01:00:43.610
at Georgetown University
Medical Center, and responsible

01:00:43.610 --> 01:00:46.400
for the operation development
of the cancer center,

01:00:46.400 --> 01:00:50.590
including the research, clinical,
and educational missions.

01:00:50.590 --> 01:00:55.260
And I think over my time here
starting medical school in the '70s

01:00:55.260 --> 01:01:00.650 position:56%
until now, I have watched the center
grow and expand and come of age

01:01:00.650 --> 01:01:05.100 position:56%
in itself and become a very integral
part of the cancer community.

01:01:05.100 --> 01:01:07.450
So, it's a pleasure
to welcome Dr. Weiner.

01:01:07.450 --> 01:01:10.440
And would you please come.

01:01:10.440 --> 01:01:12.970
&gt;&gt; Douglas Lowy: While Dr.
Weiner is coming to the podium,

01:01:12.970 --> 01:01:17.930
I want to point out that he
is the Chair of our Board

01:01:17.930 --> 01:01:22.490
of Scientific Counselors in the
Intramural Research Program.

01:01:22.490 --> 01:01:27.290
And we benefit enormously
from his advising council.

01:01:27.290 --> 01:01:28.590 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Louis Weiner: Thank you for that.

01:01:28.590 --> 01:01:31.940
I'm here with some of my heroes
and with another one of my heroes

01:01:31.940 --> 01:01:34.340
because we do all this for you.

01:01:34.340 --> 01:01:38.440
And I think it's really
important to always make sure

01:01:38.440 --> 01:01:42.590
that we keep the patient at
the center of everything we do.

01:01:42.590 --> 01:01:46.770
So, as the Director of a
Comprehensive Cancer Center,

01:01:46.770 --> 01:01:50.150
there are 47 cancer
centers like ours scattered

01:01:50.150 --> 01:01:51.890
around the United States.

01:01:51.890 --> 01:01:54.410
We have a great opportunity
to work together.

01:01:54.410 --> 01:01:55.710
And I think it's important to note

01:01:55.710 --> 01:02:00.270 position:56%
that while the Moonshot has
created a roadmap, an infrastructure

01:02:00.270 --> 01:02:04.500
that helps us I think to really
sharpen our focus on areas

01:02:04.500 --> 01:02:07.850
of great opportunity, it's
also true that it's not

01:02:07.850 --> 01:02:09.830
like we haven't been
communicating all along.

01:02:09.830 --> 01:02:12.380
I mean, we do an awful lot of
work together where, you know,

01:02:12.380 --> 01:02:15.670
the enemy is cancer; it's not
the other cancer center, right?

01:02:15.670 --> 01:02:20.750 position:56%
And so, what we're trying to do and
I think do very well is communicate,

01:02:20.750 --> 01:02:23.210
interact with each other
at the cancer center level

01:02:23.210 --> 01:02:24.550
around the United States.

01:02:24.550 --> 01:02:29.530
And in fact, as Dr. Lowy just
mentioned, working with the Board

01:02:29.530 --> 01:02:32.620 position:56%
of Scientific Counselors of
National Cancer Institute is a group

01:02:32.620 --> 01:02:35.900
of external scientists
and physicians who come

01:02:35.900 --> 01:02:40.660
and advised Dr. Lowy on the
quality of research being done

01:02:40.660 --> 01:02:45.270
on the NCI campus, NIH, and up at
the Frederick campus in Frederick.

01:02:45.270 --> 01:02:48.660 position:56%
And so, we have a great opportunity,
I think, for collaboration

01:02:48.660 --> 01:02:52.370
and to really make sure
we're keeping our game sharp

01:02:52.370 --> 01:02:55.560
and we keep it sharp in the
interest of our patients.

01:02:55.560 --> 01:02:58.940
So, I had the pleasure
of being a member

01:02:58.940 --> 01:03:02.740
of the Immunotherapy Task
Force and I've been interested

01:03:02.740 --> 01:03:06.100
in cancer immunotherapy
for a long time.

01:03:06.100 --> 01:03:11.370 position:56%
Stated simply, immunotherapy is
treating the patient's immune system

01:03:11.370 --> 01:03:14.160
so that their immune
system can treat the cancer.

01:03:14.160 --> 01:03:18.260 position:56%
It's a very different thing than
treating with a drug that's designed

01:03:18.260 --> 01:03:20.840
to kill the cancer or
giving a radiation particle

01:03:20.840 --> 01:03:22.610
or even a surgical procedure.

01:03:22.610 --> 01:03:25.800
This is basically giving
people the tools they need

01:03:25.800 --> 01:03:27.400
to get rid of their own cancer.

01:03:27.400 --> 01:03:30.140
And it's really a radical
concept and it's something

01:03:30.140 --> 01:03:33.100
that I think we're still learning
how to grapple with and how

01:03:33.100 --> 01:03:36.110
to understand in order
to make it work better.

01:03:36.110 --> 01:03:37.930
Now, when I got starter in thinking

01:03:37.930 --> 01:03:41.820
about immunotherapy some 30 years
ago, I got to tell you people

01:03:41.820 --> 01:03:45.020
who were looking out for
me thought I was crazy

01:03:45.020 --> 01:03:48.480
because they actually thought
that just didn't make any sense.

01:03:48.480 --> 01:03:50.770
The immune system has
no relevance in cancer.

01:03:50.770 --> 01:03:52.070
But they were wrong.

01:03:52.070 --> 01:03:54.580
And so, this a slide-- this is
the only real data slide I'm going

01:03:54.580 --> 01:03:58.570
to show you so don't get too
concerned, which is related

01:03:58.570 --> 01:04:02.910
to a disease that Dr. Lowy was
talking about, colon cancer.

01:04:02.910 --> 01:04:05.100
Because even though
this is a disease

01:04:05.100 --> 01:04:09.350
that can almost completely be
prevented by regular screening

01:04:09.350 --> 01:04:14.410
and having-- so that nobody need
necessarily die from it just about.

01:04:14.410 --> 01:04:17.990
The fact is that it's still one of
the most common causes of cancer

01:04:17.990 --> 01:04:19.890
and cancer death in
the United States

01:04:19.890 --> 01:04:22.140
because people don't get
their screening done.

01:04:22.140 --> 01:04:24.130
So, even a relatively early stage

01:04:24.130 --> 01:04:29.040
like stage two colon cancer
can be cured quite commonly

01:04:29.040 --> 01:04:30.530
but only 80% of the time.

01:04:30.530 --> 01:04:32.660
Twenty percent of the people
are dealing with the relapse.

01:04:32.660 --> 01:04:35.280
And using the conventional
staging that we had developed

01:04:35.280 --> 01:04:39.760
over the years, we knew that if you
had a so-called stage two cancer

01:04:39.760 --> 01:04:43.860
and you gave somebody chemotherapy
after they recovered from surgery,

01:04:43.860 --> 01:04:48.530
they had about an 80% chance of
being cured, then we go up to 83%

01:04:48.530 --> 01:04:50.210
if you give the chemotherapy.

01:04:50.210 --> 01:04:52.890
So, what that meant is you
would have to treat 100 people

01:04:52.890 --> 01:04:58.110
with toxic chemotherapy in order
to potentially save three people.

01:04:58.110 --> 01:04:59.990
Eighty of them had
made no difference.

01:04:59.990 --> 01:05:03.400
They were going to be cured
anyway so you wasted their time.

01:05:03.400 --> 01:05:06.580 position:56%
And for 17 of them, it didn't matter
because it wasn't going to work.

01:05:06.580 --> 01:05:09.900
So, the question is, how do
we actually do a better job?

01:05:09.900 --> 01:05:13.040
And the first way you can do
a better job is by figuring

01:05:13.040 --> 01:05:16.660
out who the 17 were going to
or the 20 were going to be.

01:05:16.660 --> 01:05:20.060
And it turns out by analyzing the
way the body's immune system was

01:05:20.060 --> 01:05:22.850
reacting against the
cancer, you got a better idea

01:05:22.850 --> 01:05:24.490
of what was going to happen.

01:05:24.490 --> 01:05:26.360
And moreover, it became clear

01:05:26.360 --> 01:05:29.000
that the immune system was
controlling cancer outcomes.

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:30.300
Next slide.

01:05:30.300 --> 01:05:33.040
So, you heard about
the war against cancer.

01:05:33.040 --> 01:05:38.670
This is President Nixon declaring
the War on Cancer in 1971

01:05:38.670 --> 01:05:41.200 position:56%
and signing the National Cancer Act.

01:05:41.200 --> 01:05:43.280
Next. But we have been at war

01:05:43.280 --> 01:05:45.350
against cancer throughout
human history.

01:05:45.350 --> 01:05:51.500
This is a photograph of exhumation
of a grave of a Medieval Saxon man

01:05:51.500 --> 01:05:55.280
and you can he has a large
tumor on his left leg, OK?

01:05:55.280 --> 01:05:58.100
So, we've been fighting this
throughout human history.

01:05:58.100 --> 01:06:01.970
And in fact, next slide, the
war on cancer is actually not

01:06:01.970 --> 01:06:04.870
between oncologists and cancer.

01:06:04.870 --> 01:06:08.980
It's not between pharmaceutical
companies and the FDA.

01:06:08.980 --> 01:06:12.360
The war on cancer is for
one person at a time.

01:06:12.360 --> 01:06:16.150
And the primary combatants are
the malignant cell population

01:06:16.150 --> 01:06:18.060
and the host immune system.

01:06:18.060 --> 01:06:22.070
Every single cancer that
develops in a person's bodies,

01:06:22.070 --> 01:06:27.000
that is so-called successful, has
figured out a way to either defeat

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:31.090
or deflect the body's immune system
that was directed against it.

01:06:31.090 --> 01:06:35.590
And this is a concept that I
believe was long time and coming.

01:06:35.590 --> 01:06:39.420
So, how does that happen?

01:06:39.420 --> 01:06:45.080 position:56%
Firstly, a cancer can overwhelm the
immune system by just racing faster.

01:06:45.080 --> 01:06:46.930
That does not happen very often.

01:06:46.930 --> 01:06:48.600
Sometimes it can hide.

01:06:48.600 --> 01:06:52.490
It can actually stay
away from the recognition

01:06:52.490 --> 01:06:54.410
and then you will have
a big problem.

01:06:54.410 --> 01:06:56.760
But there are now treatments
that are being developed

01:06:56.760 --> 01:07:00.510
that can actually overcome
that by artificially--

01:07:00.510 --> 01:07:04.000
by figuring out what might be
attacked artificial using something

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:05.430
called CAR T-cells.

01:07:05.430 --> 01:07:09.320
You can subvert-- The cancer
can subvert the body--

01:07:09.320 --> 01:07:13.560
body's response by elaborating
chemicals that might block signals.

01:07:13.560 --> 01:07:16.960
And you can actually attack
that with drugs and antibodies.

01:07:16.960 --> 01:07:21.170
And the cancers can shield
themselves to exclude the T-cells

01:07:21.170 --> 01:07:23.850
of the body's immune system
from attacking the cancer.

01:07:23.850 --> 01:07:26.540
And finally, when all
else is failed,

01:07:26.540 --> 01:07:30.460
a cancer can deactivate
tumor-targeting T-cells

01:07:30.460 --> 01:07:31.990
that attack tumor cells.

01:07:31.990 --> 01:07:34.940
And this is using a strategy
called checkpoint inhibition.

01:07:34.940 --> 01:07:37.070
Next. How does this happen?

01:07:37.070 --> 01:07:40.680
Well, what-- if you think about
it, it's a fantastic system.

01:07:40.680 --> 01:07:43.490
What happens is that as a
T-cell that's loaded and ready

01:07:43.490 --> 01:07:46.080
to kill the cancer cell that
it recognizes it being--

01:07:46.080 --> 01:07:49.050
as being foreign, gets into
the neighborhood of the cancer,

01:07:49.050 --> 01:07:53.170
the cancer basically erects
checkpoints that will protect it.

01:07:53.170 --> 01:07:56.930
And on the next slide, you can
see that it may be using cannon

01:07:56.930 --> 01:08:00.480
at the gate of the castle,
maybe it's a checkpoint,

01:08:00.480 --> 01:08:02.270
but perhaps it's really this,

01:08:02.270 --> 01:08:04.380
it's really Snow White
eating the poison apple.

01:08:04.380 --> 01:08:10.160 position:56%
And the poison apple is basically
the tumor that is putting the T-cell

01:08:10.160 --> 01:08:12.880
of the body's immune
system to sleep, OK?

01:08:12.880 --> 01:08:16.540
And you can reverse that
process with antibodies

01:08:16.540 --> 01:08:20.330 position:56%
that are proteins made by the--
that you can craft in the laboratory

01:08:20.330 --> 01:08:22.590
that are ordinarily in
our bodies, of course,

01:08:22.590 --> 01:08:26.680
that can actually block the
ability of the killer cells

01:08:26.680 --> 01:08:31.680
of the immune system to be put
to sleep by the tumor cells.

01:08:31.680 --> 01:08:34.500
And so, this is a really
complicated slide.

01:08:34.500 --> 01:08:36.770
There's only one thing
that matters here.

01:08:36.770 --> 01:08:39.470
As a T-cell of the body's
immune system is coming

01:08:39.470 --> 01:08:43.140
in to attack a cancer,
what happens is

01:08:43.140 --> 01:08:50.780
that the tumor cell will elaborate
various molecules that protect it

01:08:50.780 --> 01:08:52.490
and they will put it to sleep.

01:08:52.490 --> 01:08:56.900
And one of the most powerful tools
of this is a molecule called PD-L1

01:08:56.900 --> 01:08:59.210
which is a great defense mechanism.

01:08:59.210 --> 01:09:01.320
And antibodies against PD-L1

01:09:01.320 --> 01:09:06.110
or against the T-cell marker
called PD-1 have been able

01:09:06.110 --> 01:09:09.060
to essentially have remarkably
anti-tumor activities.

01:09:09.060 --> 01:09:10.400
Next slide.

01:09:10.400 --> 01:09:11.760
This is one example.

01:09:11.760 --> 01:09:17.310
This is a disease called malignant
melanoma, where individuals

01:09:17.310 --> 01:09:20.590
who are near endstage
of their cancer with it

01:09:20.590 --> 01:09:24.830
with survival expectancies of
six or seven months and had been

01:09:24.830 --> 01:09:26.840
through many other
treatments that had not--

01:09:26.840 --> 01:09:29.740
had no longer work for them
or had never worked at all,

01:09:29.740 --> 01:09:33.690 position:56%
they were treated with a combination
of checkpoint antibodies.

01:09:33.690 --> 01:09:37.020
And it was expected that
they would live seven months.

01:09:37.020 --> 01:09:40.700
Their average survival is quite
a bit longer than 40 months now.

01:09:40.700 --> 01:09:42.780
Many of these people
are being but looks

01:09:42.780 --> 01:09:45.330
like may be even cured
by this treatment.

01:09:45.330 --> 01:09:47.970
And as you can see in these
two plots here, on the top,

01:09:47.970 --> 01:09:51.520
this is looking at each line
represents an individual patient.

01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:53.490
And you can see the
vast majority of people

01:09:53.490 --> 01:09:55.670
who were treated in
this clinical trial.

01:09:55.670 --> 01:09:58.780
The volume of the tumor
which is on the Y-axis

01:09:58.780 --> 01:10:02.700
of this particular chart
drops and it's sustained

01:10:02.700 --> 01:10:05.040
and it doesn't grow back.

01:10:05.040 --> 01:10:07.070
And if you look at the magnitude
of the response that you see

01:10:07.070 --> 01:10:09.870
on the bottom plot, you can
see that the vast majority,

01:10:09.870 --> 01:10:13.190
these people have fantastic
anti-tumor responses.

01:10:13.190 --> 01:10:14.490
This is a change.

01:10:14.490 --> 01:10:16.930
This is something we
had never seen before.

01:10:16.930 --> 01:10:21.530
This is a pictorial depiction,
if you will, of the revolution

01:10:21.530 --> 01:10:23.810
that we're experiencing
in cancer care.

01:10:23.810 --> 01:10:25.110
Next slide.

01:10:25.110 --> 01:10:28.510
And this is just the
tip of the iceberg.

01:10:28.510 --> 01:10:29.960 position:56%
Well, there are-- I'd last counted--

01:10:29.960 --> 01:10:32.070
So we have a game at
Georgetown where we try

01:10:32.070 --> 01:10:36.730
and count how many different tumors
are now potentially responsive

01:10:36.730 --> 01:10:40.650
to checkpoint antibodies, and we're
up to 23 different cancers now.

01:10:40.650 --> 01:10:42.240
Now, here's the new--
And that's great news.

01:10:42.240 --> 01:10:43.880
But I want you to understand

01:10:43.880 --> 01:10:47.250
and I think Dr. Singer mentioned
it before, the great news is

01:10:47.250 --> 01:10:50.170
that these are treatments that can
work in lot of different cancers

01:10:50.170 --> 01:10:52.920
but it's the rarer type of cancer

01:10:52.920 --> 01:10:56.370
where these treatments work
all the time in every patient.

01:10:56.370 --> 01:10:59.660
Let's have a significant minority
of patients, sometimes as many

01:10:59.660 --> 01:11:04.600
as 30 will respond to a single--
at this checkpoint antibodies.

01:11:04.600 --> 01:11:08.590
In one case, Hodgkin's disease,
maybe as many as 80% will respond

01:11:08.590 --> 01:11:10.200
with a favorable outcome.

01:11:10.200 --> 01:11:12.890
But on ballots, it's
usually about 20%.

01:11:12.890 --> 01:11:16.390
And figuring out who those
20% are so we can treat them

01:11:16.390 --> 01:11:19.840
and understanding what the-- what's
happening with the other 80%,

01:11:19.840 --> 01:11:23.210
why don't-- why do their cancers
relapse, why don't they respond

01:11:23.210 --> 01:11:26.770
in the first place, what other
mechanisms are they using is one

01:11:26.770 --> 01:11:28.070
of the great challenges.

01:11:28.070 --> 01:11:31.350
And that's where the
Moonshot comes in.

01:11:31.350 --> 01:11:35.060
Because the immunotherapy
focus of the Moonshot is

01:11:35.060 --> 01:11:40.070 position:56%
to create a clinical infrastructure,
if you will, that will allow us

01:11:40.070 --> 01:11:42.710
to do the kinds of high
quality clinical trials

01:11:42.710 --> 01:11:47.470
so we can deeply interrogate
these issues in collaboration

01:11:47.470 --> 01:11:49.730
so that we can identify
who should be treated,

01:11:49.730 --> 01:11:53.500
when they should be treated, and
how their cancers are responding

01:11:53.500 --> 01:11:55.980
or not responding to the
treatments that we're using.

01:11:55.980 --> 01:12:00.320
And the other point that I think
Dr. Lowy mentioned was the idea

01:12:00.320 --> 01:12:04.790
of using the sort of a tumor
cell atlas to not only think

01:12:04.790 --> 01:12:08.060
about what's going on in the cancer
cells that are in the cancer mass

01:12:08.060 --> 01:12:12.340
but what's happening with the
immune component of the tumor,

01:12:12.340 --> 01:12:14.280 position:56%
we need to understand how that woks.

01:12:14.280 --> 01:12:18.240
So these are absolutely
foundational and really,

01:12:18.240 --> 01:12:21.510
really important new strategies
that are being employed,

01:12:21.510 --> 01:12:26.670 position:56%
that are going be facilitated by the
Moonshot and really will allow us

01:12:26.670 --> 01:12:29.350
to accelerate our progress
in a very meaningful way.

01:12:29.350 --> 01:12:30.650
Next slide.

01:12:30.650 --> 01:12:34.580
So, I'm not going to read that but
it except to say that I do think

01:12:34.580 --> 01:12:38.750
that cancer immunology
is a next great frontier.

01:12:38.750 --> 01:12:42.950
I think anybody who spends as
much time as I do at NCI is awed

01:12:42.950 --> 01:12:45.410
by the remarkable depth
and diversity

01:12:45.410 --> 01:12:47.550
of extraordinary research
being done.

01:12:47.550 --> 01:12:51.260
And there are lots and lots of
wonderful initiatives going on.

01:12:51.260 --> 01:12:54.210
But there can be no doubt that
immunology is one of them.

01:12:54.210 --> 01:12:57.140
And I think it's really
critically important to know

01:12:57.140 --> 01:13:00.390
that the Moonshot is going
to make these things happen

01:13:00.390 --> 01:13:03.360
and happen more quickly because
people's lives depend on it.

01:13:03.360 --> 01:13:05.160
Thanks very much.

01:13:05.160 --> 01:13:11.740
[ Applause ]

01:13:11.740 --> 01:13:15.890
&gt;&gt; Sandra Charles: Well, thank you
Dr. Weiner and other panelists.

01:13:15.890 --> 01:13:20.780
And while you frame your questions,
which I'm sure there are several.

01:13:20.780 --> 01:13:24.620
And here's one lady, I'll let her
ask her question before I give one.

01:13:24.620 --> 01:13:26.420
Go ahead please.

01:13:26.420 --> 01:13:30.190
One moment, we'll bring you a
microphone so everyone can hear

01:13:30.190 --> 01:13:33.820
and we'll capture it
on the recording.

01:13:33.820 --> 01:13:37.510
Yeah, get your voice together.

01:13:37.510 --> 01:13:41.050
[ Laughter ]

01:13:41.050 --> 01:13:42.350
&gt;&gt; Iris Portney: Thank you.

01:13:42.350 --> 01:13:45.310
And thank you for all your work
and this is always so exciting.

01:13:45.310 --> 01:13:48.360
I would like to say-- Well, my name
Iris Portney [assumed spelling]

01:13:48.360 --> 01:13:52.550
and I'm so in awe of our first
speaker about her journey.

01:13:52.550 --> 01:13:56.350
I will tell you that even though
much of my life was related

01:13:56.350 --> 01:13:59.640
on science and technology-based
policy,

01:13:59.640 --> 01:14:03.900 position:56%
I happened to be an 18-year survivor
of inflammatory breast cancer.

01:14:03.900 --> 01:14:08.290
So, in terms of-- yes,
nodding go up there.

01:14:08.290 --> 01:14:12.650
So, as part of that
experience, you know,

01:14:12.650 --> 01:14:14.900
I went through stem
cell transplants,

01:14:14.900 --> 01:14:18.430
any variety of sequential
treatments.

01:14:18.430 --> 01:14:21.670
And at the beginning, my
focus was, as with your report

01:14:21.670 --> 01:14:25.900
and recommendations, first--
your first focus is prevention,

01:14:25.900 --> 01:14:27.440
which should haven't happened.

01:14:27.440 --> 01:14:33.430
Second focus is treatment and
outcomes, hoping you find the stuff

01:14:33.430 --> 01:14:36.190
that works, obviously
we found various things.

01:14:36.190 --> 01:14:38.250
But the third focus and I know

01:14:38.250 --> 01:14:41.170
as the saying goes
high quality problem,

01:14:41.170 --> 01:14:48.800
the third focus is survivorship,
potential toxicity of treatments,

01:14:48.800 --> 01:14:52.410
so that you can anticipate,
recognize them right away,

01:14:52.410 --> 01:14:55.890
factor that into informed
consent and choices

01:14:55.890 --> 01:14:57.790
about what to combine and when.

01:14:57.790 --> 01:15:03.590
And so, the patient doesn't feel
kind of crazy bouncing from doctor

01:15:03.590 --> 01:15:06.320
to doctor with the symptom,
et cetera, et cetera.

01:15:06.320 --> 01:15:12.200 position:56%
So in that context-- Oh, I have
lots of large print notes to myself.

01:15:12.200 --> 01:15:17.560
Don't get scared, but I discovered
five years after I had had F5U,

01:15:17.560 --> 01:15:19.540
God bless it, responded well.

01:15:19.540 --> 01:15:22.850
But only five years later was
a clinical trial research study

01:15:22.850 --> 01:15:25.510
released that said that it
actually produced a certain amount

01:15:25.510 --> 01:15:28.050
of brain damage aftereffect.

01:15:28.050 --> 01:15:33.080 position:56%
Wish I'd known that, we were covered
now, but still need more talk input.

01:15:33.080 --> 01:15:38.020
So, I just want to suggest
this as a missing focus.

01:15:38.020 --> 01:15:40.470
I'm sure at some place
in the long report,

01:15:40.470 --> 01:15:42.080
I haven't read the entire thing,

01:15:42.080 --> 01:15:44.850
but it certainly wasn't a
working group focus and it wasn't

01:15:44.850 --> 01:15:46.470
in the executive summary.

01:15:46.470 --> 01:15:52.500
And that is research focus on
creating an extensive data base,

01:15:52.500 --> 01:16:00.330
clinical-based data on
survivorship complications.

01:16:00.330 --> 01:16:04.500
I'm very struck by the-- for
instance, the establishment

01:16:04.500 --> 01:16:08.860
and work being done by ASCO
on their cancer link database,

01:16:08.860 --> 01:16:13.660
because as you all know, 3%
of patients give data on,

01:16:13.660 --> 01:16:15.990
you know, on clinical trials.

01:16:15.990 --> 01:16:20.080
But what I was up against in our
real time stuff was reporting

01:16:20.080 --> 01:16:23.520
to wonderful doctors, who are
also professors and researchers,

01:16:23.520 --> 01:16:28.020
things that seemed unrelated,
and in the end they would say,

01:16:28.020 --> 01:16:30.340
all I can say is we didn't
think it was connected

01:16:30.340 --> 01:16:31.640
because we'd never seen it.

01:16:31.640 --> 01:16:33.990
And I said, "Great, this
is all state of the art,

01:16:33.990 --> 01:16:35.950
who are you reporting this to?"

01:16:35.950 --> 01:16:39.510
And their answer would be,
"No place to report it."

01:16:39.510 --> 01:16:42.300
So I said, "How do we know
with these new treatments--

01:16:42.300 --> 01:16:44.370
because we were using them
as soon as they came out--

01:16:44.370 --> 01:16:47.570
that there aren't other patients
that are getting them in other part

01:16:47.570 --> 01:16:50.310
of the country, talking it
to their doctors reporting it

01:16:50.310 --> 01:16:54.670
so that data can be looked at and
assessed in some sort of patterns.

01:16:54.670 --> 01:16:55.970
&gt;&gt; Sandra Charles: So let's--

01:16:55.970 --> 01:16:58.770 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Iris Portney: So I would hope you
get like a 10 to 20-year database

01:16:58.770 --> 01:17:02.300
that could be collected for stuff
so that researchers and doctors

01:17:02.300 --> 01:17:05.530
and patients can begin
to identify patterns

01:17:05.530 --> 01:17:08.390
that they weren't even looking
for as the need comes up.

01:17:08.390 --> 01:17:09.690
&gt;&gt; Sandra Charles: Thank you.

01:17:09.690 --> 01:17:12.980
I think that's a very well
succinct way of saying this.

01:17:12.980 --> 01:17:15.440
And maybe we have one
of our panelists

01:17:15.440 --> 01:17:16.740
who would like to address that.

01:17:16.740 --> 01:17:20.000
&gt;&gt; Louis Weiner: Well, why don't
you start and I can add it to that.

01:17:21.170 --> 01:17:22.470
&gt;&gt; Douglas Lowy: Yeah.

01:17:22.470 --> 01:17:26.420
So, one of the recommendations
is patient-reported outcomes

01:17:26.420 --> 01:17:29.110
and that real-- and
survivorship, if you will,

01:17:29.110 --> 01:17:32.790
that's a part and parcel of it.

01:17:32.790 --> 01:17:39.320
And so, it actually is specifically
called out in the recommendations.

01:17:39.320 --> 01:17:44.000
In addition, we have,
for many years,

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:48.350
supported children's
cohort survivorship study,

01:17:48.350 --> 01:17:52.840
where we look at least
two different issues.

01:17:52.840 --> 01:17:56.360
One is the outcomes
and the other is--

01:17:56.360 --> 01:17:59.810 position:56%
and for example, there are increased
risks of second cancers aside

01:17:59.810 --> 01:18:03.510
from long and short-- other
long and short-term side effects

01:18:03.510 --> 01:18:08.780
but also looking over time to try
to make sure that the incidence

01:18:08.780 --> 01:18:12.540
of serious side effects
is actually going down.

01:18:12.540 --> 01:18:17.230
We are in discussion of
developing an adult cohort

01:18:17.230 --> 01:18:21.110
that would be looking
specifically at that issue.

01:18:21.110 --> 01:18:22.410
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

01:18:22.410 --> 01:18:23.710
&gt;&gt; Sandra Charles: And
this young lady back here.

01:18:23.710 --> 01:18:25.010
&gt;&gt; Go ahead.

01:18:25.010 --> 01:18:26.310
You go and then I'll go.

01:18:26.310 --> 01:18:27.610
&gt;&gt; Louis Weiner: Yeah, yeah.

01:18:27.610 --> 01:18:28.910
&gt;&gt; Sandra Charles: And Dr.
Weiner wanted to address it also.

01:18:28.910 --> 01:18:30.320
&gt;&gt; Louis Weiner: So, you raised
an incredibly important point.

01:18:30.320 --> 01:18:35.460 position:56%
And I think it's a point that we
are coming to perhaps a little later

01:18:35.460 --> 01:18:37.540
than we would have
liked to in the field,

01:18:37.540 --> 01:18:41.420
partly because we haven't
had the luxury of having

01:18:41.420 --> 01:18:46.110
as many people being cured
as we're beginning to have--

01:18:46.110 --> 01:18:49.310
nor we had the great benefit of--

01:18:49.310 --> 01:18:52.990
with almost as great benefit of
people who are maybe not cured

01:18:52.990 --> 01:18:56.360
but having the diseases controlled
for very long periods of time

01:18:56.360 --> 01:18:59.270
so that they-- you know, we
have to think about things.

01:18:59.270 --> 01:19:03.140
And it's very interesting,
because I think health systems

01:19:03.140 --> 01:19:06.150
around the country are
beginning to understand this

01:19:06.150 --> 01:19:11.020
as being an important need
for the patient population

01:19:11.020 --> 01:19:14.920
and we're beginning to test out
different strategies, you know,

01:19:14.920 --> 01:19:17.780
should this be oncology based,
should it be internal medicine

01:19:17.780 --> 01:19:20.270
or family practice based,
there's a lot of question

01:19:20.270 --> 01:19:21.950
that need to be addressed.

01:19:21.950 --> 01:19:25.060
The other thing that's happening,
though, is that as the kinds

01:19:25.060 --> 01:19:27.840
of treatment we give
our patients change,

01:19:27.840 --> 01:19:33.400 position:56%
we are finding different patterns of
long-term side effects of, you know,

01:19:33.400 --> 01:19:37.170
there are anybody who experienced
chemotherapy back in the old days,

01:19:37.170 --> 01:19:39.790
you know, was, you know what the
side effects were going to be,

01:19:39.790 --> 01:19:41.850
you know what the long-term
consequences would be.

01:19:41.850 --> 01:19:43.980
And we, as doctors, we're very good

01:19:43.980 --> 01:19:47.440
at treating very specific
sides effects associated

01:19:47.440 --> 01:19:49.820
with high-dose chemotherapy,
for example.

01:19:49.820 --> 01:19:53.230
Now, with these immunotherapy
strategies, for example,

01:19:53.230 --> 01:19:56.250
we have to become doctors in
a different way all over again

01:19:56.250 --> 01:19:59.910
because now we have people whose
body's immune systems have been

01:19:59.910 --> 01:20:02.980
activated or causing all kinds
of new and different kinds

01:20:02.980 --> 01:20:06.400
of long-term consequences
that we have to understand.

01:20:06.400 --> 01:20:12.500
We all recognize that
these consequences are

01:20:12.500 --> 01:20:14.670
in some ways good,
paradoxically good.

01:20:14.670 --> 01:20:18.030
It's because they're working
and people are living longer

01:20:18.030 --> 01:20:20.050
and more people are
potentially being cured

01:20:20.050 --> 01:20:21.350
and that's a wonderful thing.

01:20:21.350 --> 01:20:23.020
But we're finding out that some

01:20:23.020 --> 01:20:25.070
of these treatments
can attack the heart

01:20:25.070 --> 01:20:28.450 position:56%
in ways we never even dreamt before.

01:20:28.450 --> 01:20:33.340 position:56%
And we all have to become sensitized
and, you know, sharpen our readings

01:20:33.340 --> 01:20:35.230
so that we can understand
what has to be done,

01:20:35.230 --> 01:20:37.770
and sharing that information
so that we can all learn

01:20:37.770 --> 01:20:40.070
about it is absolutely essential.

01:20:40.070 --> 01:20:41.370
&gt;&gt; Sandra Charles: Dr. Sigal.

01:20:41.370 --> 01:20:42.670
&gt;&gt; Ellen Sigal: Yeah.

01:20:42.670 --> 01:20:43.970
I just want to take this one also.

01:20:43.970 --> 01:20:46.970
It's an incredibly important point.

01:20:46.970 --> 01:20:52.780 position:56%
Thirty years ago, we knew there was
toxicity but we were really fighting

01:20:52.780 --> 01:20:56.450
for life, and honestly
just tolerated a lot

01:20:56.450 --> 01:20:59.110
and we didn't have a lot
of long-term [inaudible].

01:20:59.110 --> 01:21:03.330 position:56%
We actually have a lot of data now,
but there is a huge problem with it.

01:21:03.330 --> 01:21:07.330
First of all, it exists in much
different database-- basis.

01:21:07.330 --> 01:21:08.630
They don't talk to one another.

01:21:08.630 --> 01:21:11.840
They're not linked, so the
FDA has the sentinel project

01:21:11.840 --> 01:21:15.260
which is safety data, which
is really claims data,

01:21:15.260 --> 01:21:18.890
but they have almost
200 million lives on it.

01:21:18.890 --> 01:21:21.190
So they have a lot of information.

01:21:21.190 --> 01:21:23.120
I was at PCORI.

01:21:23.120 --> 01:21:26.020
I'm on the board of the
patient-centered research outcomes

01:21:26.020 --> 01:21:30.450
and we have probably 70 to
100 millions lives in it.

01:21:30.450 --> 01:21:33.910
And we have the cancer
link and then we have the--

01:21:33.910 --> 01:21:37.030
insurance companies
have a lot of data.

01:21:37.030 --> 01:21:40.530
The problem is, is they're not
synchronized, they don't talk

01:21:40.530 --> 01:21:43.080
to one another, they're
in different formats,

01:21:43.080 --> 01:21:46.650
electronic health records
and a claims data.

01:21:46.650 --> 01:21:49.040
So, linking them to
understand is important.

01:21:49.040 --> 01:21:50.580
But there is a new emphasis.

01:21:50.580 --> 01:21:55.970
Also, the NCI has [inaudible] so
this is really the idea of quality

01:21:55.970 --> 01:22:00.360
of life data, really defining
metrics that are uniform

01:22:00.360 --> 01:22:03.350
so we can really understand
it before that companies

01:22:03.350 --> 01:22:06.040
where people would say,
well, you feel better,

01:22:06.040 --> 01:22:08.950
there were less hospitalization
but the data wasn't rigorous,

01:22:08.950 --> 01:22:11.790
we didn't understand the standards.

01:22:11.790 --> 01:22:15.770 position:56%
And FDA took the lead-- I'm sorry,
NCI took the lead on it [inaudible].

01:22:15.770 --> 01:22:21.860
And now this really means that when
companies are already doing their

01:22:21.860 --> 01:22:24.120
trials or when we are
doing our trials,

01:22:24.120 --> 01:22:26.340
even at the National
Cancer Institute,

01:22:26.340 --> 01:22:31.480
we can incorporate these bonafide
data sets and really understand.

01:22:31.480 --> 01:22:34.020
And what we're trying to do
at France is work with the FDA

01:22:34.020 --> 01:22:36.250
to have these as label indications.

01:22:36.250 --> 01:22:40.700 position:56%
So if you really have a treatment or
choices between multiple treatments

01:22:40.700 --> 01:22:44.090
and you have a label
indication that one is less toxic

01:22:44.090 --> 01:22:48.120 position:56%
or has different side effects and
they're both as equally efficacious,

01:22:48.120 --> 01:22:50.130
you can make more informed
decisions.

01:22:50.130 --> 01:22:52.830
So this is becoming very
important but there--

01:22:52.830 --> 01:22:56.100
it's highly complex because there
are different forms of cancer,

01:22:56.100 --> 01:22:58.680
different types of
treatments, we didn't know them.

01:22:58.680 --> 01:23:02.600
But putting this data together
and getting out of our silos

01:23:02.600 --> 01:23:06.010
and harmonizing it, it is going
to become incredibly important.

01:23:06.010 --> 01:23:07.310
&gt;&gt; Sandra Charles: Thank you.

01:23:07.310 --> 01:23:09.560
Back here.

01:23:09.560 --> 01:23:10.960
&gt;&gt; Maureen Harrington:
Hi, thank you.

01:23:10.960 --> 01:23:12.330
I'm Maureen Harrington.

01:23:12.330 --> 01:23:14.080
I'm assistant general counsel here.

01:23:14.080 --> 01:23:15.730
And, first of all,
thanks to Dr. Charles

01:23:15.730 --> 01:23:18.480
for putting together this
terrific panel and thank to--

01:23:18.480 --> 01:23:20.540
thanks to you all for being here

01:23:20.540 --> 01:23:22.830
and for the very important
work that you're doing.

01:23:22.830 --> 01:23:26.220 position:56%
I'm wondering if you are going to
be examining at all the role of diet

01:23:26.220 --> 01:23:28.250
and cancer prevention treatment.

01:23:28.250 --> 01:23:32.030 position:56%
I know the World Health Organization
recently found that meat

01:23:32.030 --> 01:23:35.140
and processed meats in particular,
were a contributing factor.

01:23:35.140 --> 01:23:38.180 position:56%
And I haven't gone through all of
your report yet, but what I did see,

01:23:38.180 --> 01:23:39.720
I didn't really see that addressed.

01:23:39.720 --> 01:23:41.800
Is that something you'll
be exploring?

01:23:41.800 --> 01:23:46.340
&gt;&gt; Douglas Lowy: The short answer
is we are supporting research

01:23:46.340 --> 01:23:47.810
in this area.

01:23:47.810 --> 01:23:51.980
I want to emphasize something
that Dr. Singer said.

01:23:51.980 --> 01:23:57.110
This is a subset of the
research activities of the NCI.

01:23:57.110 --> 01:24:02.660
Given the status of diet and
nutrition and our understanding

01:24:02.660 --> 01:24:06.210
of it, it's an area where
there's enormous need.

01:24:06.210 --> 01:24:10.030
Whether there is the same
opportunity right now,

01:24:10.030 --> 01:24:14.210
I think is not entirely resolved.

01:24:14.210 --> 01:24:19.270
So this is an area where we need
to continue to support research

01:24:19.270 --> 01:24:25.770
but it's not directly part of the
Blue Ribbon Panel recommendations.

01:24:25.770 --> 01:24:27.070
&gt;&gt; Sandra Charles: Dr. Singer?

01:24:27.070 --> 01:24:28.370
&gt;&gt; Dinah Singer: Yeah.

01:24:28.370 --> 01:24:29.670 position:56%
Just to build on what Dr. Lowy said.

01:24:29.670 --> 01:24:33.420
In the working groups, a
variety of things were discussed

01:24:33.420 --> 01:24:36.670
as potential for acceleration.

01:24:36.670 --> 01:24:39.360
In the early detection and
prevention working group

01:24:39.360 --> 01:24:43.500
and actually in the implementation
science working group, both,

01:24:43.500 --> 01:24:49.630
the conversations included the
question of diet and behavior

01:24:49.630 --> 01:24:51.530
and could anything be done there.

01:24:51.530 --> 01:24:54.900
And as Doug mentioned, the
sense was we have a lot

01:24:54.900 --> 01:24:57.700
of research really going on
especially in the division

01:24:57.700 --> 01:25:04.280
of cancer prevention but nothing
that could be clearly specified

01:25:04.280 --> 01:25:06.060
as poised for acceleration.

01:25:06.060 --> 01:25:10.600
And so, the conclusion was
to allow NCI to continue

01:25:10.600 --> 01:25:15.730
to support our ongoing portfolio,
continue to pay attention to it

01:25:15.730 --> 01:25:19.510
but not highlighted as one
of the recommendations.

01:25:19.510 --> 01:25:22.680
[ Inaudible Remark ]

01:25:22.680 --> 01:25:25.860
It's ongoing research that
we'll continue to support.

01:25:25.860 --> 01:25:28.270
&gt;&gt; Ellen Sigal: I just
want to add to that.

01:25:28.270 --> 01:25:31.010
First of all, we know a lot now.

01:25:31.010 --> 01:25:32.570
There's a lot-- I mean,
first of all,

01:25:32.570 --> 01:25:35.930
not only at the National Cancer
Institute which has a budget

01:25:35.930 --> 01:25:39.820
of over 5 billion but there are
other institutes [inaudible] this

01:25:39.820 --> 01:25:42.200
and American Cancer Society.

01:25:42.200 --> 01:25:45.110
But, you know, we know
a lot about tobacco.

01:25:45.110 --> 01:25:46.690
We know a lot about obesity.

01:25:46.690 --> 01:25:50.100
We know a lot about
things that are screening.

01:25:50.100 --> 01:25:51.800
And unfortunately, there are--

01:25:51.800 --> 01:25:55.350
you know, we still struggle
with behavioral changes.

01:25:55.350 --> 01:26:00.010
I mean, that's really obesity
is becoming a huge issue.

01:26:00.010 --> 01:26:02.980
So there's a lot that we have to
study and we have to understand,

01:26:02.980 --> 01:26:05.140
not only the science
but the behavior.

01:26:05.140 --> 01:26:08.590
I mean, I'm still astounded
about how many people walk

01:26:08.590 --> 01:26:10.900
and walk around, and
not just in Europe,

01:26:10.900 --> 01:26:12.960
which is decreasing
a bit but even here.

01:26:12.960 --> 01:26:14.750
Our rates have come down a lot.

01:26:14.750 --> 01:26:17.060
Screening there's a lot
going on, on lung cancer.

01:26:17.060 --> 01:26:19.770
So, it is a very important
component.

01:26:19.770 --> 01:26:24.290
But there's tremendous amount that
we know now that's not being done.

01:26:24.290 --> 01:26:25.590
&gt;&gt; Sandra Charles: Somebody

01:26:25.590 --> 01:26:28.850
in the back here first,
and then here and here.

01:26:28.850 --> 01:26:30.220
&gt;&gt; Yeah. How you doing?

01:26:30.220 --> 01:26:33.430
I'm a cancer survivor-- prostate.

01:26:33.430 --> 01:26:35.750
I have-- The only problem I have,

01:26:35.750 --> 01:26:40.860
I have side effects
from too much radiation.

01:26:40.860 --> 01:26:49.570
At times I get-- the blood clots
be coming and pain is terrible.

01:26:49.570 --> 01:26:55.370
I have to flush my system
a lot by drinking water.

01:26:55.370 --> 01:27:00.130
OK. Are you all working
on, you know,

01:27:00.130 --> 01:27:04.490 position:56%
when you get too much radiation of--

01:27:04.490 --> 01:27:05.790
&gt;&gt; Louis Weiner: Yeah.

01:27:05.790 --> 01:27:10.380 position:56%
Those are very significant problems.

01:27:10.380 --> 01:27:12.650
And this is another
survivorship question.

01:27:12.650 --> 01:27:13.950
&gt;&gt; Sandra Charles: Yes.

01:27:13.950 --> 01:27:15.250
&gt;&gt; Sandra Charles: Louis Weiner:
It's really all about that.

01:27:15.250 --> 01:27:20.510
And, you know, it's obviously hard
to comment on any individual case.

01:27:20.510 --> 01:27:27.240 position:56%
But what I can say is that your
story reminds us how important it is

01:27:27.240 --> 01:27:31.270
to remember that when
we cure somebody,

01:27:31.270 --> 01:27:34.080
we have to make sure we
cure them in such a way

01:27:34.080 --> 01:27:38.840
that they can live well for--
in addition to living longer.

01:27:38.840 --> 01:27:41.310
And this is where innovation

01:27:41.310 --> 01:27:45.980
and technology and--
can really play a role.

01:27:45.980 --> 01:27:49.870
So, at Lombardi, we are
finishing the installation

01:27:49.870 --> 01:27:53.900
of a proton therapy radiation unit.

01:27:53.900 --> 01:27:55.550
And, you know, there
are some evidence

01:27:55.550 --> 01:27:58.470
and certainly there has been
good evidence over the years

01:27:58.470 --> 01:28:02.490
that as radiation therapy
machines have improved

01:28:02.490 --> 01:28:04.690
in their technological
sophistication,

01:28:04.690 --> 01:28:09.800
you can give a tighter and
tighter degree of radiation right

01:28:09.800 --> 01:28:12.990
around the tumor and you can
spare with the normal tissue

01:28:12.990 --> 01:28:15.720
so you don't have some of
those terrible side effects

01:28:15.720 --> 01:28:17.160
that you just described.

01:28:17.160 --> 01:28:20.640
So, I actually think that
in part, the way we're going

01:28:20.640 --> 01:28:23.470
to be addressing a lot of
these long-term side effects is

01:28:23.470 --> 01:28:27.160
by developing better
targeted treatments be

01:28:27.160 --> 01:28:30.340
at medicines or radiation
or surgery.

01:28:30.340 --> 01:28:33.220
And I think the-- And the other
thing we have to do, though,

01:28:33.220 --> 01:28:35.160 position:56%
is we have to remember-- and this is

01:28:35.160 --> 01:28:38.150
where survivorship research
can make a difference,

01:28:38.150 --> 01:28:40.360
it's care research as well.

01:28:40.360 --> 01:28:44.340
How do we best find ways
to help people who suffer

01:28:44.340 --> 01:28:46.240
from these kinds of side effects?

01:28:46.240 --> 01:28:53.520
And so, I think-- again, it's--
we're still in the earliest phases

01:28:53.520 --> 01:28:55.580
of this to some degree
and it's a shame

01:28:55.580 --> 01:28:57.930
that we haven't made more
progress in many ways.

01:28:57.930 --> 01:28:59.830
But I think that over
the next few years,

01:28:59.830 --> 01:29:03.930
we're going to see an increasing
focus on helping people clean

01:29:03.930 --> 01:29:06.280
up the mess that the
doctors made after we got--

01:29:06.280 --> 01:29:08.010
recovered with their cancer.

Oh, here, Stephanie.

Hi, I'm Stephanie Marcus
from here at the library

01:29:18.250 --> 01:29:19.700
and I'm a science librarian.

01:29:19.700 --> 01:29:21.930
As we were talking,
I was thinking back

01:29:21.930 --> 01:29:26.760
on my own family's experience back
in 1977 when my dad was diagnosed

01:29:26.760 --> 01:29:29.090
with prostate cancer,
which was missed

01:29:29.090 --> 01:29:32.870
by the local physician
in a town of 2,500.

01:29:32.870 --> 01:29:36.670
And luckily, not in the end,
but I was here at the library

01:29:36.670 --> 01:29:39.880
and had resources like I
did research even though

01:29:39.880 --> 01:29:42.070
in those days we didn't
have much for databases

01:29:42.070 --> 01:29:44.730
but I could find articles
and I found

01:29:44.730 --> 01:29:47.200
that there were the
NCI cancer centers

01:29:47.200 --> 01:29:51.250
and I contacted [inaudible]
someone in Rosewell in Buffalo

01:29:51.250 --> 01:29:55.280
and they directed us to Iowa City
where my dad got some treatment.

01:29:55.280 --> 01:30:00.010 position:56%
In the end he died, but I'm thinking
now of all the people who go

01:30:00.010 --> 01:30:03.070
to their local doctors who
don't really know that much

01:30:03.070 --> 01:30:07.300
and how can we be assured that
they're going to find us the care

01:30:07.300 --> 01:30:10.340
that we need, they're
not going to miss things

01:30:10.340 --> 01:30:12.050
and they're going to
have the resources.

01:30:12.050 --> 01:30:13.350
Because it still happens.

01:30:13.350 --> 01:30:17.440
You hear about people who do their
own research, patients and parents

01:30:17.440 --> 01:30:21.550
who go out and movies are made
about it, but is there going

01:30:21.550 --> 01:30:25.670
to be something done about making
sure everyone can get the care

01:30:25.670 --> 01:30:26.970
they need?

01:30:26.970 --> 01:30:28.270
&gt;&gt; Ellen Sigal: I can
start to take that on.

01:30:28.270 --> 01:30:30.200
It's very complicated.

01:30:30.200 --> 01:30:31.500
One of the things that came

01:30:31.500 --> 01:30:35.480
up on the National Cancer Act
is this extraordinary resource

01:30:35.480 --> 01:30:38.910
of these cancer centers
all through the country.

01:30:38.910 --> 01:30:41.730
So, there are-- How
many comprehensive?

01:30:41.730 --> 01:30:43.560
&gt;&gt; Louis Weiner: There's
47 comprehensives.

01:30:43.560 --> 01:30:44.860
&gt;&gt; Ellen Sigal: Forty-seven and?

01:30:44.860 --> 01:30:46.750
&gt;&gt; Louis Weiner: And there's
about 68, I think it is.

01:30:46.750 --> 01:30:49.120
About 69?

01:30:49.120 --> 01:30:50.420
&gt;&gt; Ellen Sigal: Sixty-nine.

01:30:50.420 --> 01:30:56.690
So, the thing about it is, these
are highly trained academics doing

01:30:56.690 --> 01:30:59.340
research and clinical care.

01:30:59.340 --> 01:31:03.540
Eighty-five percent of our patients
get treated in a community setting.

01:31:03.540 --> 01:31:07.740
And in some cases, in
most cases, it's fine.

01:31:07.740 --> 01:31:11.830
However, there is a huge
variance in standards of care

01:31:11.830 --> 01:31:14.150
in how people are treated.

01:31:14.150 --> 01:31:18.590
And I always encourage people
to go for a second opinion.

01:31:18.590 --> 01:31:23.040
You know, we have this-- these
centers all over the country.

01:31:23.040 --> 01:31:26.390
And although there is terrific
community care in most cases,

01:31:26.390 --> 01:31:29.840
and in most cases they're
frankly doing a good job

01:31:29.840 --> 01:31:34.380
but people get very scared when
they get a diagnosis of cancer

01:31:34.380 --> 01:31:36.970
and they want to immediately
get treatment.

01:31:36.970 --> 01:31:41.670 position:56%
And sometimes, going to experts who
have specific expertise in that form

01:31:41.670 --> 01:31:45.650
of cancer at one of our centers,
is really very, very, very helpful.

01:31:45.650 --> 01:31:48.180
And there are standards and
there are guidelines and there's,

01:31:48.180 --> 01:31:50.730 position:56%
of course, research that you can do.

01:31:50.730 --> 01:31:55.930
But it's complex and it is uneven
and of course in minority areas

01:31:55.930 --> 01:31:58.110
and where there are
really, you know,

01:31:58.110 --> 01:32:01.990 position:56%
not the resources rural populations,
it's really very troubling

01:32:01.990 --> 01:32:04.780
and very difficult to get
patients to the right care.

01:32:04.780 --> 01:32:08.240
But if they can get to a center or
if they can get a second opinion,

01:32:08.240 --> 01:32:14.580
it really can be as really
life-- it can change your life.

01:32:14.580 --> 01:32:19.030
&gt;&gt; Sandra Charles: Let me say on
that note that the partnerships

01:32:19.030 --> 01:32:21.080
that are mentioned in your report--

01:32:21.080 --> 01:32:24.230
in your recommendation of
having public, private,

01:32:24.230 --> 01:32:28.990
as well as other partnerships,
is where we at the library,

01:32:28.990 --> 01:32:33.920 position:56%
in the health unit, and other parts,
can play a role because that is one

01:32:33.920 --> 01:32:38.320
of the things that will help bring
forums such as this out in the open

01:32:38.320 --> 01:32:42.440
where people come in and ask
questions here about resources,

01:32:42.440 --> 01:32:44.990
plus we will have on
hand within our office,

01:32:44.990 --> 01:32:48.030
on our website resources
to share with people.

01:32:48.030 --> 01:32:51.100
So as we continue this and
have these partnerships,

01:32:51.100 --> 01:32:56.070
I can see as really playing our
role in getting the word out

01:32:56.070 --> 01:32:59.870
and getting people
particularly the ones

01:32:59.870 --> 01:33:05.140
who are the non-scientific patient
community, knowing what is going on

01:33:05.140 --> 01:33:09.230
and take-- and we're also the ones
who answer the questions of quality

01:33:09.230 --> 01:33:11.430
of life and care resources

01:33:11.430 --> 01:33:15.360
when people experience some
other side effects that they do.

01:33:15.360 --> 01:33:22.680
So, already, I see a lot of
different reasons for you to return

01:33:22.680 --> 01:33:26.700
and have a new visitor experience.

01:33:26.700 --> 01:33:31.270
One second, Mr. Simon
here has a question.

01:33:31.270 --> 01:33:33.090 position:56%
Actually I see many other questions.

01:33:33.090 --> 01:33:35.590
I'm pretty sure we're
past 1 o'clock.

01:33:35.590 --> 01:33:36.890
&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.

01:33:36.890 --> 01:33:38.830
&gt;&gt; Sandra Charles: And
I would just like to--

01:33:38.830 --> 01:33:42.420
after you asked your question and
get an answer, I'm going to ask one

01:33:42.420 --> 01:33:46.300
of our other planning
partners, Dr. Tomoko Steen,

01:33:46.300 --> 01:33:49.790
who was also in the science
business and technology division

01:33:49.790 --> 01:33:52.870
and who was one of the
people who partnered with us.

01:33:52.870 --> 01:33:57.260
She is an oncology pharmacist,
licensed both here and in Japan--

01:33:57.260 --> 01:34:01.830
in New York and in
Japan, and a lecturer also

01:34:01.830 --> 01:34:03.540
at Georgetown University.

01:34:03.540 --> 01:34:08.180
So, I would like for her to
come forward after this question

01:34:08.180 --> 01:34:13.580
to offer thanks to everyone
who participated in this,

01:34:13.580 --> 01:34:16.100
and if you are able and willing

01:34:16.100 --> 01:34:18.660
as people [inaudible]
questions thereafter.

01:34:18.660 --> 01:34:21.510
Go ahead, Don.

01:34:21.510 --> 01:34:25.010
&gt;&gt; Don Simons: That went on
so long I forgot my question.

01:34:25.010 --> 01:34:26.310
[ Laughter ]

01:34:26.310 --> 01:34:27.610
I'm just kidding.

01:34:27.610 --> 01:34:33.120
No, I want to thank all of you,
like each one of us feel for the--

01:34:33.120 --> 01:34:36.320
all the great works that
you're doing in terms of--

01:34:36.320 --> 01:34:40.220
and treatment with immunotherapy,
immunotherapy and the research

01:34:40.220 --> 01:34:42.850
that you're doing in terms of
collecting all the data to find

01:34:42.850 --> 01:34:47.790
out who has, what, and how long
they've had it and prevention

01:34:47.790 --> 01:34:50.390 position:56%
in terms of screening and behaviors.

01:34:50.390 --> 01:34:53.250
But one thing I didn't
hear anything about

01:34:53.250 --> 01:34:57.710
and maybe a report addresses it,
and maybe a recommendations do,

01:34:57.710 --> 01:34:59.270
is what's causing cancer.

01:34:59.270 --> 01:35:03.100
In one particular area that I don't
think it has to do with behavior,

01:35:03.100 --> 01:35:08.980
necessarily, that you hear about,
are toxins in our consumer products

01:35:08.980 --> 01:35:11.570
and constant changes
in our environments.

01:35:11.570 --> 01:35:14.760
And maybe there's more of a policy
question and a science question,

01:35:14.760 --> 01:35:18.420
but is anything being
looked at in respect to that

01:35:18.420 --> 01:35:20.500
and are there any recommendations
that are coming

01:35:20.500 --> 01:35:23.160
out on how to address that?

01:35:24.300 --> 01:35:30.270
&gt;&gt; Douglas Lowy: So, let me say
that one of our sister agencies,

01:35:30.270 --> 01:35:32.330
part of the NIH, the
National Institute

01:35:32.330 --> 01:35:34.150
for Environmental Health Sciences,

01:35:34.150 --> 01:35:39.570
focuses on environmental
causes of cancer.

01:35:39.570 --> 01:35:46.070
We look-- We support research in
that area as well as other aspects

01:35:46.070 --> 01:35:51.350
of causes of cancer including
obesity, infections, and--

01:35:51.350 --> 01:35:56.400
but when we look at
the different causes,

01:35:56.400 --> 01:36:00.940
tobacco continues to
be front and center.

01:36:00.940 --> 01:36:06.650
And when we think about, I mean, in
the context of the cancer Moonshot,

01:36:06.650 --> 01:36:11.190
tobacco really ends up being
the thing that we focus

01:36:11.190 --> 01:36:13.950
on when we're talking
about environmental causes,

01:36:13.950 --> 01:36:17.570
one of the other recommendations,
because there is a vaccine

01:36:17.570 --> 01:36:19.850
that can prevent cancers caused

01:36:19.850 --> 01:36:24.340
by HPV infection emphasizing
uptake of the vaccine.

01:36:24.340 --> 01:36:29.100
But really these other areas,
it's one of the reasons why it's

01:36:29.100 --> 01:36:32.290
so important for us to
continue to be funded

01:36:32.290 --> 01:36:37.680 position:56%
for our other appropriations because
this is just one area where we need

01:36:37.680 --> 01:36:39.750
to continue to do research

01:36:39.750 --> 01:36:47.290
to uncover other important
environmental causes of cancer.

01:36:47.290 --> 01:36:48.590
&gt;&gt; Sandra Charles: OK.

01:36:48.590 --> 01:36:50.340
Do you have something, Juanita?

01:36:50.340 --> 01:36:56.050
And Tomoko, in the
meantime, [inaudible].

01:36:56.050 --> 01:36:57.350
&gt;&gt; Juanita Lyle: OK.

01:36:57.350 --> 01:37:01.830 position:56%
Just to go back over
survivorship, one [inaudible] for me

01:37:01.830 --> 01:37:06.630
because I was the one-- chemo for
three years, the first protocol,

01:37:06.630 --> 01:37:11.800
CML for two years, the
second protocol AC protocol,

01:37:11.800 --> 01:37:15.030
and then intensive
three months radiation.

01:37:15.030 --> 01:37:20.520
The aftermath of that, for
me, was a number of things.

01:37:20.520 --> 01:37:26.890
For one thing, in 2012, because
my heart-- I had previously had,

01:37:26.890 --> 01:37:32.410
what was called electrophysiology
ablation catheterization

01:37:32.410 --> 01:37:35.920
to fix a very fast heartbeat.

01:37:35.920 --> 01:37:37.220
I had that done.

01:37:37.220 --> 01:37:42.400
And then in 2012, my
heart had dropped 18%.

01:37:42.400 --> 01:37:48.590
And then my chambers were no
longer actually working together.

01:37:48.590 --> 01:37:55.710
Also, my heart muscle was shut,
my electrical conduction was shut.

01:37:55.710 --> 01:38:00.110
So I had to end up being implanted
with a pacemaker and defibrillator

01:38:00.110 --> 01:38:05.390 position:56%
which is what runs my heart, because
my heart no longer runs on its own.

01:38:05.390 --> 01:38:07.610 position:56%
So this was something that occurred.

01:38:07.610 --> 01:38:12.480
Because my immunity system
was down, in 2013 I ended

01:38:12.480 --> 01:38:18.260 position:56%
up getting acute renal kidney
failure, and was wheeled out of here

01:38:18.260 --> 01:38:24.200
and to the emergency room because
that dropped down to a five level.

01:38:24.200 --> 01:38:31.340 position:56%
So, all that to say, lymphedema is
with me, degenerating these diseases

01:38:31.340 --> 01:38:37.220
with me, because I had radiation
was not monitored back then,

01:38:37.220 --> 01:38:39.920
both my hands so I
have carpal tunnel

01:38:39.920 --> 01:38:42.380
from the radiation as been proven.

01:38:42.380 --> 01:38:45.190
And definitely loss of
memory when she's talking

01:38:45.190 --> 01:38:49.470
about the brain situation, I
have some of those issues along

01:38:49.470 --> 01:38:53.710
with the fact that what we
haven't touched upon is the fact

01:38:53.710 --> 01:38:56.240
of PTSD in cancer patients.

01:38:56.240 --> 01:38:59.870
So a lot of the times, the
younger you are it seems to be,

01:38:59.870 --> 01:39:03.980
and we did something on
that here at the library,

01:39:03.980 --> 01:39:07.240
because all these programs
that Dr. Charles is doing,

01:39:07.240 --> 01:39:11.770
I partnered with her because of
the fact I've seen the need for us

01:39:11.770 --> 01:39:15.510
to be able to have quality
lives in some way because I had

01:39:15.510 --> 01:39:17.460
to create my quality life.

01:39:17.460 --> 01:39:18.990
I had a good diet.

01:39:18.990 --> 01:39:22.490
As I said, I had all the
right things but I ended

01:39:22.490 --> 01:39:25.290
up getting advanced
stages in cancer.

01:39:25.290 --> 01:39:27.860
So, all that to say,
that's why we're going

01:39:27.860 --> 01:39:30.880
to have you all back
again and again.

01:39:30.880 --> 01:39:35.020
And so, I'm going to
get this over to Tomoko

01:39:35.020 --> 01:39:37.350
who partners with us as well.

01:39:37.350 --> 01:39:38.650
&gt;&gt; Tomoko Steen: OK.

01:39:38.650 --> 01:39:42.820
One thing that did-- was not
mentioned is cost of treatment,

01:39:42.820 --> 01:39:47.550
especially immunotherapy, and
it's-- the evolution on treatment.

01:39:47.550 --> 01:39:51.390
So, on behalf of all those
sponsoring organization

01:39:51.390 --> 01:39:52.820
at the Library of Congress,

01:39:52.820 --> 01:39:58.260
we'd like to thank excellent
panelists and excellent audience.

01:39:58.260 --> 01:40:03.630
So, we hope we can do it,
you know, 2017, continuously.

01:40:03.630 --> 01:40:06.510
And thank you so much
for coming, everyone.

01:40:06.510 --> 01:40:10.080
