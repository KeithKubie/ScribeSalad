MOLLY LAVIK: I want to welcome
you to the Authors at Google.

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:08.090
And tonight, we're talking
about Going Supernova,

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:11.500
the Bold Paths of
101 Superachievers.

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:15.850
And we have this super achiever
superstar panel tonight

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:18.400
with us, and we're
about to introduce them.

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.890
First though, I want to get
started with a few very, very

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:23.690
quick thank yous.

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:26.950
I cannot start any of these
without thanking the woman who

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:29.420
graces this cover,
Patty Wagstaff,

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:32.490
one of the greatest aerobatic
pilots in the world,

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:36.560
and on the back cover, my friend
and someone who helped me with

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:40.230
a story template, pilot
Ronald Wayne Trumbull.

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.930
Thank you out there in Hawaii.

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.070
So with that said, there are
also several people tonight

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:47.724
who made tonight possible.

00:00:47.724 --> 00:00:49.390
And you're going to
be hearing from Jeff

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:54.090
Rozic in a moment, who is
our host and very dear friend

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.680
and someone that I
admire tremendously.

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.260
And he's helping teach
me how to be more Googly,

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.800
and I appreciate that.

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.010
I also want especially
thank the Googlers

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.480
that are here tonight--
what a great company, what

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:10.200
an iconic brand.

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.580
It's very exciting.

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.130
What we like to do
it at these talks

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.000
is really feature the
people who are in the book.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.650
The purpose behind
the book is that I

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.590
do believe that
super achievement is

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:23.350
something you can emulate.

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:25.450
So if you could have
an example of the most

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:27.930
extraordinary people
out there doing the most

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.980
incredible, phenomenal, game
changing, paradigm shifting,

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:34.500
curve jumping-- I learned
that from Guy Kawasaki,

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.970
who, by the way, is my
mentor and someone that there

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.000
would be notebook without.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.160
That's what tonight's about,
is saluting people like that

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.970
so that you can
emulate their mindset.

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.710
And you're going to get to hear
some previews of their story.

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:55.680
And of course, I cannot start
without thank Keith Powers,

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.100
someone that I look
up to tremendously.

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.150
This book would not probably
have half the people in that

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:06.900
if it wasn't Keith who reached
out to his golden Rolodex

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:09.680
and asked people and introduced
me to people, like Jenny,

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:11.320
and made tonight possible.

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:16.190
And I welcome his wife, who's
here tonight, Lynn Powers,

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:18.920
and their beautiful daughter,
Harmony, who are here.

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.030
So thank you so much.

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:25.490
And with all of that said,
a few words from our host,

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:27.590
Jeff Rozic, before
we get started.

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:29.899
So thank you all for
coming out tonight.

00:02:29.899 --> 00:02:30.940
JEFF ROZIC: Hi, everyone.

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:32.080
I am your Google host.

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.589
And that's all I am,
as far as hosts go.

00:02:34.589 --> 00:02:36.380
I work at Google, and
we'll talk a bit more

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:38.390
about my little story later.

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:41.314
I'm truly humbled to be on
this panel of supernovas.

00:02:41.314 --> 00:02:43.480
And I just want to thank
you all for coming tonight,

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.605
after hours, of course--
those of you who work here

00:02:45.605 --> 00:02:48.240
on campus, those who traveled
all across the Bay Area

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.810
to be part of this book
event, ad here from all these

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.930
very inspiring and
educating people with us.

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:56.800
Molly was one of my business
school professors-- almost 10

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.650
years ago, we were
talking about it today.

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.330
It's been about 10 years since.

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:04.080
Any class of hers that
she offered, I took.

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:05.740
This was in business school.

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:08.590
And it's because she
wasn't just a teacher.

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:10.260
And those are really
important, too.

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.710
But she was also an inspired
educator and connector.

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:16.080
Every single class--
not every semester,

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.360
every single class-- she brought
in people to the classroom,

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:21.610
realizing that's probably
the most important value out

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:24.324
of a business education, is to
start meeting people, hearing

00:03:24.324 --> 00:03:25.990
real stories, and
connecting with people

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:28.670
who you can work with in
different ways later on.

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:31.430
So it's something she
always did without fail.

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:34.790
She made sure we all knew where
to go see Guy Kawasaki talking

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:38.040
about the art of the start when
he came down to Los Angeles

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:41.070
and made sure we could meet
him if we had a good reason to.

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:43.959
Or other entrepreneurs all
over the Los Angeles area--

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:46.500
just always surrounding us with
great mentors in the business

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:47.410
community.

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:50.350
Just by being here
tonight, I'm 100% sure

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:52.770
Molly would let you
into Molly's gang.

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:54.080
We're all in Molly's gang.

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:56.400
And I'm sure she would let
each of you into it too.

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:57.780
And she would also
make sure that each

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.770
of your interactions--
it's not just networking.

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:00.970
It's really
connecting and helping

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:02.594
people in meaningful
ways, whether it's

00:04:02.594 --> 00:04:04.440
on a business or
project or an education

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:05.660
or whatever it might be.

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:07.640
That's the one thing
I've learned from Molly.

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:09.920
I'm very humble to be with
our other guests tonight.

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:11.378
But most importantly,
thank you all

00:04:11.378 --> 00:04:12.992
for coming out to
talk to us too.

00:04:12.992 --> 00:04:13.950
MOLLY LAVIK: Thank you.

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:14.450
Excellent.

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:16.295
Thank you for that.

00:04:16.295 --> 00:04:21.470
And now, it is my
extreme pleasure

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:25.060
to welcome to the
stage Guy Kawasaki, who

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:27.710
has another best
seller out there.

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:28.920
It's wonderful.

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:31.180
Guy, thank you for
being my mentor.

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:33.300
Thank you for your
sense of humor

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:37.030
that gets me to laugh
in the darkest of days.

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:40.090
And I know everybody is very
excited to hear from you.

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:41.930
So come on up and
share your wisdom.

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:42.070
GUY KAWASAKI: Thank you.

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:42.903
Thank you very much.

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:47.920
So thank you, Molly.

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:50.250
It's very nice to be here.

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:51.440
I really love Google.

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:53.190
I have to tell
you, I spent a year

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:57.860
working for Motorola, which
was part of Google at the time.

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:59.530
And I had a great time.

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:01.520
And I have some very
close friends here.

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:03.520
So it's always a pleasure.

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:05.470
I feel more welcome
here than, shall I say,

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:11.580
at that Cupertino-based
company, where-- I don't even

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:14.410
dare go there anymore.

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:17.950
So I'll tell you a
little bit about my past.

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:20.830
I worked for Apple
from 1983 to '87.

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:23.010
I was Apple's
evangelist to convince

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:24.880
people to write Mac software.

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:27.160
I left, started some
software companies.

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:30.530
I returned as Apple's chief
evangelist back in 1995,

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:33.150
because Apple was
supposed to die in 1995.

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:36.660
So I came back to help
prevent that from happening.

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:40.720
And then I left in '97
to start another company.

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:44.220
And since then, I've been
a writer and a speaker.

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:46.500
I have started another company.

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:49.040
And then now, I'm
chief evangelist

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:51.540
for a Sydney-based
company called Canva.

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:54.470
And Canva is in the
business of helping

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:56.720
people create online graphics.

00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:59.790
So we're trying to
democratize design

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:02.380
so you don't have to
buy an expensive program

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:04.520
and spend days and
days learning it.

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:08.330
So Apple, in my mind,
democratized computing.

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:10.290
And Google democratized
information.

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:12.580
And Canva is
democratizing design.

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:17.770
And so as you can
tell, I love democracy.

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:19.840
So that's why I
aligned with Canva

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:22.180
and I'm Canva's
chief evangelist.

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:26.200
So to the topic of the book
about all these super achievers

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:28.660
and stuff-- I'm kind of
flattered to be in the book

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:29.600
at all.

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:31.140
But I have to tell you.

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:37.630
This is a very good
insight into life,

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:40.400
if you ever think
that you've arrived.

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:42.570
So I won't tell you
who did it tonight.

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:48.460
But tonight, someone
said to me, oh, I

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:50.460
work for the company
that hosts your website.

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:51.100
I said, really?

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:51.891
And she goes, yeah.

00:06:51.891 --> 00:06:53.270
And she said, oh yeah.

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:55.540
We have all the stuff
for Rich Dad, Poor Dad.

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:57.270
I'm like, oh my god.

00:06:57.270 --> 00:06:59.950
So that's Kiyosaki,
not Kawasaki.

00:06:59.950 --> 00:07:04.080
So welcome to my life.

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:07.380
So we not only all look
alike, we also sound alike.

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:10.430
And then she went on to
say, so do you speak much?

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:13.720
And I go, OK.

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:16.280
So that's my life.

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:16.780
It's good.

00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:18.510
It's good to have
experiences like that.

00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:21.520
As long as you can laugh about
it, you're doing all right.

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:27.640
So if I were to give you
the shorter synopsis of why

00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:31.170
I'm in the book, besides
being Molly's friend-- so how

00:07:31.170 --> 00:07:33.500
did I achieve
whatever I achieved?

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:35.600
Lots of people have
lots of different ideas,

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:37.750
but my idea is very simple.

00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:39.900
I am just willing to work.

00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:41.260
I love to work.

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:43.260
I am willing to grind it out.

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:45.810
I don't consider myself smart.

00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:47.780
I don't consider
myself visionary.

00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:49.492
I just will out work people.

00:07:49.492 --> 00:07:51.200
There are people who
are smarter than me.

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:52.908
There are people who
work harder than me.

00:07:52.908 --> 00:07:55.240
But nobody can out work
and be smarter than me.

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:57.580
So I love to work.

00:07:57.580 --> 00:07:58.740
I love to grind it out.

00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:00.810
I get great
satisfaction out of it.

00:08:00.810 --> 00:08:04.950
And that is reflected
in my writing style.

00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:07.890
The chapter that I made
is mostly about writing.

00:08:07.890 --> 00:08:09.940
And I'll tell you,
the gist of my writing

00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:14.040
is I like to vomit out the first
version as fast as possible.

00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:15.200
Well, back up.

00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:20.210
So I like to have a complete
outline, absolutely down

00:08:20.210 --> 00:08:21.210
to the paragraph level.

00:08:21.210 --> 00:08:22.410
I have an outline.

00:08:22.410 --> 00:08:24.770
And it takes me
months to do that.

00:08:24.770 --> 00:08:26.270
And after I have
the outline, then I

00:08:26.270 --> 00:08:28.820
want to just vomit it
out as fast as possible.

00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:30.830
I want to fill out that outline.

00:08:30.830 --> 00:08:35.340
And then I go back, and to use
a very gross metaphor, then

00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:37.360
it's a matter of
filtering the vomit.

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:40.870
And so you have to pick out
the undigested chunks of food

00:08:40.870 --> 00:08:43.140
to just get to your nutrients.

00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:45.090
And that's what you see
in a published books.

00:08:45.090 --> 00:08:48.420
Now you're never gonna
read a book of mine, right?

00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:50.970
So basically, that's my process.

00:08:50.970 --> 00:08:51.720
Get it out.

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:53.370
Remove all the undigested food.

00:08:53.370 --> 00:08:56.180
And leave just pure goodness.

00:08:56.180 --> 00:09:01.150
And it takes hours and
hours and days and days.

00:09:01.150 --> 00:09:04.440
To me, the key is
not good writing.

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:05.894
It's good editing.

00:09:05.894 --> 00:09:06.810
That's the difference.

00:09:06.810 --> 00:09:08.690
A good writer is a good editor.

00:09:08.690 --> 00:09:10.800
And if you have a
concept that writing

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:14.270
is the process of
getting a large advance

00:09:14.270 --> 00:09:17.200
from a traditional
publisher-- and now you

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:18.830
bought a beach house
with that advance.

00:09:18.830 --> 00:09:22.450
And you're sitting on the back
porch on a windswept beach.

00:09:22.450 --> 00:09:25.150
And your kids are
all straight A.

00:09:25.150 --> 00:09:29.240
The house is perfectly clean,
all the dishes put away.

00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:30.430
Your spouse is happy.

00:09:30.430 --> 00:09:32.800
Everything is great.

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:35.200
And you sit down.

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:37.850
And you get a fountain
pen, Mont Blanc fountain

00:09:37.850 --> 00:09:40.510
pen with an 18-karat gold nib.

00:09:40.510 --> 00:09:44.670
And you sit down to a
stack of parchment handmade

00:09:44.670 --> 00:09:46.950
by Tibetan monks.

00:09:46.950 --> 00:09:50.139
And you sit there and the words
just flow out from your brain

00:09:50.139 --> 00:09:52.430
through your arm, through
your wrist to your fingertips

00:09:52.430 --> 00:09:53.660
on your Mont Blanc.

00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:57.990
And you write in cursive this
fantastic manuscript, right?

00:09:57.990 --> 00:09:59.740
And then you send
that manuscript

00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:02.160
to your editor in New
York who drops everything

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:06.190
as soon as it comes in,
shuts off the computer,

00:10:06.190 --> 00:10:10.260
shuts off the phone, reads your
manuscript in the next four

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:12.220
or five hours, calls
you up and says,

00:10:12.220 --> 00:10:15.290
in the history of my
editorial career-- I've

00:10:15.290 --> 00:10:17.390
been an editor in New
York for 30 years--

00:10:17.390 --> 00:10:20.550
I have never read a perfect
manuscript until today.

00:10:20.550 --> 00:10:23.050
So you get that phone call.

00:10:23.050 --> 00:10:25.240
Then he continues on
and says, I talked

00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:27.342
to the publicity department.

00:10:27.342 --> 00:10:28.550
And we don't know what to do.

00:10:28.550 --> 00:10:32.790
We have a big problem because
Charlie Rose and Oprah and 60

00:10:32.790 --> 00:10:34.442
Minutes all want to feature you.

00:10:34.442 --> 00:10:35.650
And they all want exclusives.

00:10:35.650 --> 00:10:36.972
We don't know what to do.

00:10:36.972 --> 00:10:38.430
And we don't know
if we should sell

00:10:38.430 --> 00:10:46.230
the rights to NPR or to
Discovery Channel or to--

00:10:46.230 --> 00:10:46.950
SPEAKER: FOX.

00:10:46.950 --> 00:10:48.950
GUY KAWASAKI: FOX.

00:10:48.950 --> 00:10:50.010
No, it won't be FOX.

00:10:50.010 --> 00:10:51.960
I'll never sell a book to FOX.

00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:56.620
I would rather be
poor than be on FOX.

00:10:56.620 --> 00:11:01.340
So that is not at
all how it happens.

00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:02.730
It is a grind.

00:11:02.730 --> 00:11:04.170
It is a brutal grind.

00:11:04.170 --> 00:11:08.600
And a lot of people say,
well, why do you write then?

00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:10.910
Well, I'll tell you, the
only thing worse than writing

00:11:10.910 --> 00:11:12.150
is not writing.

00:11:12.150 --> 00:11:13.440
And that's why I do it.

00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:18.430
You have to be
quasi-masochistic.

00:11:18.430 --> 00:11:20.840
Somewhat OCD to be a writer.

00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:25.840
And that's what I
am, in a nutshell.

00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:28.010
So I told you the
key to my success.

00:11:28.010 --> 00:11:29.620
I told you the
key to my writing.

00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:31.280
What else can I tell you?

00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:33.030
MOLLY LAVIK: Well, you
could tell everyone

00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:34.402
about your new bestseller.

00:11:34.402 --> 00:11:35.110
GUY KAWASAKI: Oh.

00:11:35.110 --> 00:11:35.750
Oh.

00:11:35.750 --> 00:11:39.010
So I have a book called
"The Art of Social Media."

00:11:39.010 --> 00:11:41.240
This is a book that I
co-wrote with the person who

00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:44.810
I believe is the best social
media person in the world.

00:11:44.810 --> 00:11:49.450
And I would put her up
against entire agencies.

00:11:49.450 --> 00:11:50.410
So we wrote a book.

00:11:50.410 --> 00:11:57.240
It's about-- god, it's
maybe 150 pages long.

00:11:57.240 --> 00:11:59.280
It has more than 100 tips.

00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:00.640
It's very tactical.

00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:03.810
It's how to use
social media, how

00:12:03.810 --> 00:12:05.640
to use it as a
marketing platform.

00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:08.240
It is not about social
media for social reasons.

00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:11.310
If you want to just meet
your friends and roommates

00:12:11.310 --> 00:12:13.452
and college buddies
and all that,

00:12:13.452 --> 00:12:14.660
this is not the book for you.

00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:18.050
This is a book about how to
use social media as a marketing

00:12:18.050 --> 00:12:18.980
tool.

00:12:18.980 --> 00:12:22.120
And it's very tactical.

00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:24.590
It's devoid of duh-isms.

00:12:24.590 --> 00:12:27.870
A duh-ism is stuff like "you
need to engage your followers."

00:12:27.870 --> 00:12:30.340
Or a duh-is, is "you
need to be transparent."

00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:35.190
Or a duh-ism is "you
need a good profile."

00:12:35.190 --> 00:12:37.860
If you don't know that by
now, don't read this book.

00:12:37.860 --> 00:12:40.990
And so I take it
much, much deeper.

00:12:40.990 --> 00:12:43.900
So for example, yes,
you need a good profile.

00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:44.710
Duh.

00:12:44.710 --> 00:12:47.970
But then I explain that this
is what makes a good avatar.

00:12:47.970 --> 00:12:51.440
A good avatar is
a photo, primarily

00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:54.520
of your face, if not only
of your face, asymmetric.

00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:59.020
Use the rule of thirds for where
you put the eyes, front lit.

00:12:59.020 --> 00:13:05.050
And don't take a group shot
with a smart phone of 12 of you

00:13:05.050 --> 00:13:08.060
and then crop your
face out because that's

00:13:08.060 --> 00:13:09.020
the only part you need.

00:13:09.020 --> 00:13:11.200
And that's your avatar, so when
people click on the avatar,

00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:11.991
it's all pixelated.

00:13:11.991 --> 00:13:14.300
So we go into that
level of detail

00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:17.250
on the major issues
of social media.

00:13:17.250 --> 00:13:21.774
And it's doing pretty
well, I must say.

00:13:21.774 --> 00:13:23.190
MOLLY LAVIK: It's
doing very well.

00:13:23.190 --> 00:13:25.460
GUY KAWASAKI: Yeah,
because no one's ever

00:13:25.460 --> 00:13:30.480
written a book at
this low level.

00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:32.280
If this book were a
computer language,

00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:35.130
it would be assembly language,
if you know what I mean.

00:13:35.130 --> 00:13:37.190
So that's that book.

00:13:37.190 --> 00:13:38.700
I'm not here to pimp my book.

00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:40.455
I'm here to pimp Molly's book.

00:13:40.455 --> 00:13:41.413
MOLLY LAVIK: Thank you.

00:13:41.413 --> 00:13:44.780
GUY KAWASAKI: So
I'm really happy.

00:13:44.780 --> 00:13:46.140
And I'm happy to be here.

00:13:46.140 --> 00:13:50.440
And Molly's Studs Terkel
done right, maybe.

00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:54.370
So you're too young to know
who Studs Terkel is, right?

00:13:54.370 --> 00:13:55.380
Do you know?

00:13:55.380 --> 00:13:57.900
How many of you know
who Studs Terkel is?

00:13:57.900 --> 00:14:01.550
Yeah, well, he
wrote a book where

00:14:01.550 --> 00:14:07.330
he profiled people of all
sorts of professions-- what

00:14:07.330 --> 00:14:10.830
it was like to be a waiter or
a waitress or a truck driver.

00:14:10.830 --> 00:14:16.420
It was a very, very
seminal book in my life.

00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:17.452
So that's it.

00:14:17.452 --> 00:14:18.660
MOLLY LAVIK: Well, thank you.

00:14:18.660 --> 00:14:21.070
Well, Guy's going to be
back to answer questions

00:14:21.070 --> 00:14:22.159
in just a little bit.

00:14:22.159 --> 00:14:24.450
And let's give him a big
round of applause [INAUDIBLE].

00:14:24.450 --> 00:14:24.830
GUY KAWASAKI: Thank you.

00:14:24.830 --> 00:14:25.404
Thank you.

00:14:25.404 --> 00:14:27.312
[APPLAUSE]

00:14:27.312 --> 00:14:30.180
MOLLY LAVIK: --for his story and
he makes writing a bestseller

00:14:30.180 --> 00:14:32.490
sound so easy, but--

00:14:32.490 --> 00:14:33.490
GUY KAWASAKI: Easy?

00:14:33.490 --> 00:14:34.550
Who said it's easy?

00:14:34.550 --> 00:14:38.160
MOLLY LAVIK: Well,
you make it look easy.

00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:41.790
Anyhow, I'm very excited
to next introduce

00:14:41.790 --> 00:14:46.304
Jenny Alden, who about a year
ago had a really bad year.

00:14:46.304 --> 00:14:47.720
JENNY ALDEN: I'll
tell that story.

00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:49.240
MOLLY LAVIK: And I'm not gonna
say anything else, so come on

00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:49.795
up Jen.

00:14:54.389 --> 00:14:55.180
JENNY ALDEN: Hello.

00:14:55.180 --> 00:14:57.432
I'm just gonna move
these bottles off.

00:14:57.432 --> 00:14:58.850
MOLLY LAVIK: Good idea.

00:14:58.850 --> 00:15:01.183
JENNY ALDEN: Sorry, I was in
production in my past life.

00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:07.270
Well, first of all, thank you
so much, Molly, for having me.

00:15:07.270 --> 00:15:08.420
Thank you, Google.

00:15:08.420 --> 00:15:11.620
It's really an honor to get
to speak with you all tonight

00:15:11.620 --> 00:15:13.720
and share my story.

00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:16.780
When I was first approached
about being in a book

00:15:16.780 --> 00:15:21.430
about super achievers, I had
to scratch my head a little bit

00:15:21.430 --> 00:15:26.720
and question, what does it
mean to be a super achiever?

00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:32.390
And I thought, I think has
something to do with success.

00:15:32.390 --> 00:15:36.784
But then that begs the
question, what is success?

00:15:36.784 --> 00:15:39.450
Now, I think my definition might
be a little different than most

00:15:39.450 --> 00:15:41.825
people on this panel, or
Silicon Valley, for that matter.

00:15:41.825 --> 00:15:43.990
But ever since I
was a little girl,

00:15:43.990 --> 00:15:46.180
if you asked me what it
meant to be successful,

00:15:46.180 --> 00:15:48.880
I would say being happy.

00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:53.360
And that's a philosophy I've
held onto my whole life.

00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:58.560
But then the real question is,
how do you maintain happiness

00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:01.750
in the face of great adversity?

00:16:01.750 --> 00:16:06.280
And in 2013, I got to figure
that one out all on my own.

00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:11.810
And what I found
were two mottoes

00:16:11.810 --> 00:16:15.750
that I really held
onto for my dear life.

00:16:15.750 --> 00:16:21.740
And the first one was to have
an attitude of gratitude.

00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:26.210
And the second--
it's only temporary.

00:16:26.210 --> 00:16:28.230
It's only temporary.

00:16:28.230 --> 00:16:32.390
This too shall pass.

00:16:32.390 --> 00:16:35.580
So if you read my
story, you'll see

00:16:35.580 --> 00:16:38.530
that I had a fairytale wedding.

00:16:38.530 --> 00:16:41.150
I married the man of my dreams.

00:16:41.150 --> 00:16:44.150
We talked of having
kids and everything

00:16:44.150 --> 00:16:47.270
and it looked like my
dreams were coming true.

00:16:47.270 --> 00:16:50.500
But 10 months after
this wonderful wedding,

00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:52.300
the fairy dust
settled when I was

00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:55.230
diagnosed with a brain tumor.

00:16:55.230 --> 00:16:57.680
And we found the
tumor incidentally.

00:16:57.680 --> 00:16:59.300
I fell off a hammock.

00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:01.390
My head banged against cement.

00:17:01.390 --> 00:17:03.210
We thought maybe I
had a concussion.

00:17:03.210 --> 00:17:05.339
So we went to the
ER to make sure

00:17:05.339 --> 00:17:08.710
that there was no internal
bleeding and it was OK.

00:17:08.710 --> 00:17:11.540
And I was really annoyed when
I thought I had a concussion.

00:17:11.540 --> 00:17:14.260
I thought, what a waste
of a perfect Sunday.

00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:15.619
Why am I in an ER?

00:17:15.619 --> 00:17:17.420
This is really annoying.

00:17:17.420 --> 00:17:19.869
But when the doctor basically
said, hey, good news,

00:17:19.869 --> 00:17:22.155
there's no internal
bleeding, but it

00:17:22.155 --> 00:17:25.680
looks like you might
have a brain tumor,

00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:29.550
I was actually pretty grateful
that I found that out.

00:17:29.550 --> 00:17:33.140
I was like, that's
why I hit my head.

00:17:33.140 --> 00:17:34.290
That's why I'm here.

00:17:34.290 --> 00:17:36.760
And I had this sense
that you know what?

00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:39.020
It's going to be OK.

00:17:39.020 --> 00:17:42.160
And it turned out to
be the size of a golf

00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:47.470
ball in the shape of an olive
in my left temporal lobe, which

00:17:47.470 --> 00:17:51.730
is where your verbal logic
and comprehension is.

00:17:51.730 --> 00:17:58.750
And it seemed like I
would need brain surgery.

00:17:58.750 --> 00:18:00.590
And with brain
surgery came the risk

00:18:00.590 --> 00:18:05.401
of losing my ability to speak
and comprehend language.

00:18:05.401 --> 00:18:07.150
And the chances were
that I would probably

00:18:07.150 --> 00:18:09.310
have about 10
years left to live.

00:18:09.310 --> 00:18:13.830
And that would be 10 years
with chemo and radiation.

00:18:13.830 --> 00:18:16.480
I completely ignored
that last part.

00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:18.050
I just knew in my
heart of hearts

00:18:18.050 --> 00:18:20.350
I have another 100 years in me.

00:18:20.350 --> 00:18:23.920
As for the verbal logic and
comprehension, I was like,

00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:26.480
there's no way they're taking
away my ability to speak.

00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:28.930
But if they do, I will
dominate speech therapy

00:18:28.930 --> 00:18:31.440
and I will figure it out.

00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:37.030
What I knew it that I had no
choice but to be positive.

00:18:37.030 --> 00:18:39.330
I thought, there was no
sense in worrying about this

00:18:39.330 --> 00:18:40.792
until we cross that bridge.

00:18:40.792 --> 00:18:42.000
There was nothing I could do.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.070
So I just was happy.

00:18:44.070 --> 00:18:45.260
I hung out with my friends.

00:18:45.260 --> 00:18:46.240
I went gluten free.

00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:48.750
I worked out more.

00:18:48.750 --> 00:18:50.750
I went to Burning Man
and some weddings.

00:18:54.470 --> 00:18:57.920
And then I had an open
awake brain surgery

00:18:57.920 --> 00:19:01.250
on my one-year
wedding anniversary.

00:19:01.250 --> 00:19:04.550
And Dr. Mitchell Berger, with
his incredible brain mapping

00:19:04.550 --> 00:19:08.740
technique that he pioneered,
saved my ability to speak

00:19:08.740 --> 00:19:10.920
and comprehend.

00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:14.480
And it turned out to
be a ganglioglioma.

00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:17.510
What a beautiful
word-- a ganglioglioma.

00:19:17.510 --> 00:19:21.280
Only 1% of brain tumors
are gangliogliomas.

00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:22.720
It will never grow back.

00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:24.120
He got the whole thing out.

00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:27.380
I didn't need any
chemo or radiation.

00:19:27.380 --> 00:19:28.630
And it turned out I was right.

00:19:28.630 --> 00:19:30.825
There was not much
really to worry about.

00:19:30.825 --> 00:19:35.840
So good thing I didn't waste
all that energy worrying?

00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:38.160
That was an incredible
experience for me--

00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:42.380
to have that unique
opportunity to have

00:19:42.380 --> 00:19:45.600
family and friends, old
and new, come together.

00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:48.210
I saw burned bridges mend.

00:19:48.210 --> 00:19:50.500
And after that
experience, I just

00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:51.790
felt like, I can do anything.

00:19:55.300 --> 00:19:58.342
What I wasn't
prepared for was what

00:19:58.342 --> 00:19:59.675
happened after my brain surgery.

00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:07.139
Eight months later, I found
out that my newlywed husband

00:20:07.139 --> 00:20:09.305
started to cheat on me at
the time of the operation.

00:20:12.650 --> 00:20:14.820
And what felt like
a double betrayal

00:20:14.820 --> 00:20:16.829
was that this girl,
who was sleeping

00:20:16.829 --> 00:20:19.120
with my husband for eight
months since I was recovering

00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:21.910
from brain surgery,
followed me on Facebook,

00:20:21.910 --> 00:20:24.030
was a Facebook friend,
and completely knew

00:20:24.030 --> 00:20:28.890
about the whole brain surgery
journey and my wedding photos

00:20:28.890 --> 00:20:31.390
and honeymoon pictures
and everything-- was just

00:20:31.390 --> 00:20:32.970
totally aware.

00:20:32.970 --> 00:20:34.860
And as a female who
loves other women

00:20:34.860 --> 00:20:37.460
and supports them and has a
book club with over 100 girls

00:20:37.460 --> 00:20:40.590
on my mailing with, it
leaves me tongue tied today

00:20:40.590 --> 00:20:42.830
to even-- I can't
wrap my head around.

00:20:42.830 --> 00:20:45.690
Who does that to someone else?

00:20:45.690 --> 00:20:48.840
So I had just experienced
the best of humanity

00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:50.820
with my brain tumor.

00:20:50.820 --> 00:20:54.400
I was now slapped
with the worst of it.

00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:59.970
And my world was turned
inside out and upside down.

00:20:59.970 --> 00:21:03.146
I lost about nine
pounds in one week.

00:21:03.146 --> 00:21:05.280
I got a new flock of
wrinkles my facialist swore

00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:07.790
was not there the week before.

00:21:07.790 --> 00:21:10.320
I had complete insomnia.

00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:13.390
My body was flushing with
adrenaline for like a month

00:21:13.390 --> 00:21:15.160
straight.

00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:16.340
Thank god my mom was there.

00:21:16.340 --> 00:21:17.370
She drove me
everywhere, because I

00:21:17.370 --> 00:21:19.244
would have gotten in a
car accident for sure.

00:21:19.244 --> 00:21:23.410
I was just this numb
zombie who could not

00:21:23.410 --> 00:21:25.720
make sense of the world.

00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:29.890
But at this time, I also
couldn't ignore the glittering

00:21:29.890 --> 00:21:32.870
goodness that I
was experiencing.

00:21:32.870 --> 00:21:35.030
I had friends who
sent me flowers,

00:21:35.030 --> 00:21:39.030
who sent me baked goods, who
showed up at my door, who

00:21:39.030 --> 00:21:40.780
took me for a
mani-pedi or a night

00:21:40.780 --> 00:21:45.340
on the town, who spent the night
with me, who just would hold

00:21:45.340 --> 00:21:47.036
my hand while I sobbed.

00:21:47.036 --> 00:21:48.910
I had people in the
grocery store, strangers,

00:21:48.910 --> 00:21:51.890
who would give me a hug when
they just found me sobbing.

00:21:51.890 --> 00:21:56.840
And I was like, wow, I feel like
the luckiest girl in the world.

00:21:56.840 --> 00:22:01.280
What did I do to deserve these
friends, this family, my dog,

00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:05.070
the best dog in the world?

00:22:05.070 --> 00:22:08.150
I just couldn't believe
this outpouring of love

00:22:08.150 --> 00:22:09.470
that I was receiving.

00:22:09.470 --> 00:22:12.380
And every text message
that would just say, hey,

00:22:12.380 --> 00:22:15.260
thinking of you,
would lift me up.

00:22:15.260 --> 00:22:17.430
Like ants coming together
and lifting up a raft,

00:22:17.430 --> 00:22:19.346
my friends, these wonderful
people in my life,

00:22:19.346 --> 00:22:22.300
kept me alive.

00:22:22.300 --> 00:22:24.770
It's crazy to think
about just a year

00:22:24.770 --> 00:22:27.879
and change from now,
there was one night,

00:22:27.879 --> 00:22:29.670
in addition to the
infidelity and the brain

00:22:29.670 --> 00:22:31.580
tumor and other things,
I had an experience

00:22:31.580 --> 00:22:34.560
that induced a form
of long migraine.

00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:36.780
And it kind of just
fried my brain.

00:22:36.780 --> 00:22:39.240
I couldn't even add
two and two, really.

00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:42.430
And I was in bed and
my face was war torn

00:22:42.430 --> 00:22:45.810
and my heart was bleeding
and my brain didn't work.

00:22:45.810 --> 00:22:49.910
And I just was like, I
have nothing right now.

00:22:49.910 --> 00:22:54.484
And I was trying to figure
out how to accidentally die,

00:22:54.484 --> 00:22:56.650
because I had heard once
that if you commit suicide,

00:22:56.650 --> 00:22:59.610
you come back in your
next life as a hairball.

00:22:59.610 --> 00:23:02.240
And I knew there was
no way I could do that.

00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:04.740
There was no way to come back
again, as a hairball, no less.

00:23:04.740 --> 00:23:06.323
I was just really
trying to figure out

00:23:06.323 --> 00:23:10.370
how do I just accidentally not
have to ever wake up again?

00:23:10.370 --> 00:23:13.004
But the very next day, my
friend came over and took me out

00:23:13.004 --> 00:23:14.170
and I had the greatest time.

00:23:14.170 --> 00:23:16.590
I was like, wow, not even
24 hours ago, I didn't even

00:23:16.590 --> 00:23:18.510
know if I could
handle this life.

00:23:18.510 --> 00:23:21.630
And that was temporary.

00:23:21.630 --> 00:23:25.400
And a year and change
later, I am so healthy--

00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:28.160
aside from this cold--
healthy and happy

00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:31.307
and my world is full
of possibilities.

00:23:31.307 --> 00:23:33.890
And so what I want to leave with
you guys tonight, because I'm

00:23:33.890 --> 00:23:35.830
sure everyone has their
own thing going on--

00:23:35.830 --> 00:23:37.640
it might not be as
cool as a brain tumor,

00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:39.300
but something's going on.

00:23:39.300 --> 00:23:41.590
And if you can look for
the silver lining in it,

00:23:41.590 --> 00:23:42.836
there is one, I promise you.

00:23:42.836 --> 00:23:44.460
Even though it's hard
to see right now,

00:23:44.460 --> 00:23:45.720
there is a silver lining.

00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:49.770
And if you hold onto that
with an attitude of gratitude,

00:23:49.770 --> 00:23:52.480
you will soar upward and onward.

00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:53.710
Thank you.

00:23:53.710 --> 00:23:58.190
[APPLAUSE]

00:23:59.630 --> 00:24:01.983
GUY KAWASAKI: I'm glad
I went before her.

00:24:01.983 --> 00:24:03.432
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:03.432 --> 00:24:04.781
MOLLY LAVIK: Thank you, Jenny.

00:24:04.781 --> 00:24:07.030
That always makes me cry to
hear that beautiful story.

00:24:07.030 --> 00:24:09.217
GUY KAWASAKI: Note to
self, don't follow Jenny.

00:24:12.380 --> 00:24:15.080
MOLLY LAVIK: Now, for the
person who is following Jenny,

00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:20.570
it is my pleasure to introduce
Keith Powers, a dear friend.

00:24:20.570 --> 00:24:22.440
Please come up and
share your story.

00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:24.331
KEITH POWERS: Sure.

00:24:24.331 --> 00:24:24.830
All right.

00:24:24.830 --> 00:24:26.579
Well, I'm glad she
kept that really light,

00:24:26.579 --> 00:24:29.470
because it makes
it so much easier.

00:24:29.470 --> 00:24:32.490
So I guess since we're
Google, I thought

00:24:32.490 --> 00:24:34.590
I'd package this
as Google speak.

00:24:34.590 --> 00:24:37.120
I feel like I'm part
of the extended family.

00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:41.680
My wife Michiko works in
Google-- what do you call it?--

00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:42.840
People Dev.

00:24:42.840 --> 00:24:45.050
And so she's been here
for about five years.

00:24:45.050 --> 00:24:51.110
And so my daughter Harmony,
who's in the back there,

00:24:51.110 --> 00:24:53.155
learning how to code--
so we're here often,

00:24:53.155 --> 00:24:55.530
and we kind of feel like we're
part of the Google family.

00:24:55.530 --> 00:24:59.460
And so I thought I'd package
it into risk and package risk

00:24:59.460 --> 00:25:02.470
into your 20% time.

00:25:02.470 --> 00:25:06.350
And so growing up, I
had role models to me.

00:25:06.350 --> 00:25:10.020
I was not what you would call
an overachiever in high school.

00:25:10.020 --> 00:25:13.320
It was unlikely that I was
going to go to college.

00:25:13.320 --> 00:25:15.490
I stopped doing some
things that I was doing,

00:25:15.490 --> 00:25:22.180
but I'll keep [INAUDIBLE],
and ended up basically

00:25:22.180 --> 00:25:24.960
getting out of my environment.

00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:28.220
And then I took some advice
from some of these mentors.

00:25:28.220 --> 00:25:30.270
And two of them
were my brothers.

00:25:30.270 --> 00:25:33.590
And when I was growing up, I
saw them traveling the world

00:25:33.590 --> 00:25:36.420
and taking all sorts of risks
and following their passions.

00:25:36.420 --> 00:25:39.110
And so the first thing
I did after I changed

00:25:39.110 --> 00:25:42.402
my environment was--
I was from Boston.

00:25:42.402 --> 00:25:44.110
And I said, well, let
me get out of here.

00:25:44.110 --> 00:25:47.080
And so I just kept taking
risks whenever I could.

00:25:47.080 --> 00:25:49.230
And so whenever there
was a path to go down,

00:25:49.230 --> 00:25:52.900
I would always take the
path with the highest risk.

00:25:52.900 --> 00:25:55.711
And so at that time, my
20% time was taking risks

00:25:55.711 --> 00:25:57.460
and learning about
things and doing things

00:25:57.460 --> 00:25:58.590
as passionate about.

00:25:58.590 --> 00:26:00.505
And the 80% time was
actually doing work

00:26:00.505 --> 00:26:02.440
so I could pay for
those other things.

00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:05.620
And I was able to do
that all through my 20s.

00:26:05.620 --> 00:26:09.830
And I came out here
when I was about 28,

00:26:09.830 --> 00:26:13.410
after taking a trip to Nepal and
spending some time with my wife

00:26:13.410 --> 00:26:15.290
trekking and in Japan.

00:26:15.290 --> 00:26:16.250
And I landed here.

00:26:16.250 --> 00:26:19.600
And then I was trying to figure
out a way-- how do I switch it?

00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:23.570
So how do I go from 20% of
doing stuff I'm passionate about

00:26:23.570 --> 00:26:26.620
and then grueling the
way-- and I'm a workaholic.

00:26:26.620 --> 00:26:28.170
I'm working nonstop.

00:26:28.170 --> 00:26:30.870
And it's not because-- it's
just something I have to do.

00:26:30.870 --> 00:26:33.177
It's like I can't turn it off.

00:26:33.177 --> 00:26:35.260
And so I tried to figure
out how do I switch that?

00:26:35.260 --> 00:26:38.180
And how do I make the 80%
the 20% and the 20% the 80%?

00:26:40.920 --> 00:26:43.940
But I also wanted to benefit
humanity and do something good.

00:26:43.940 --> 00:26:46.000
So I had an idea for startup.

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:48.200
And one connection
point was I went

00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:53.810
to a boot camp, one of your
boot camps in '98 or '99.

00:26:53.810 --> 00:26:57.070
And I thought, let's
democratize transportation

00:26:57.070 --> 00:27:00.170
by letting people who
can't afford a car

00:27:00.170 --> 00:27:02.690
and in so they can't get to
work-- let's figure out how

00:27:02.690 --> 00:27:05.120
to get people to
work by advertising.

00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:06.800
And so I had a company
called Free Car.

00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:07.850
And we would wrap cars.

00:27:07.850 --> 00:27:09.460
And the whole plan
was to give away

00:27:09.460 --> 00:27:11.210
cars with advertising
on them so that they

00:27:11.210 --> 00:27:12.585
could pay for
their cars for free

00:27:12.585 --> 00:27:15.210
and give it to people who were
driving in demographics who

00:27:15.210 --> 00:27:17.780
were driving down the
101 or in the 405 in LA,

00:27:17.780 --> 00:27:19.710
but basically get people
to where they need

00:27:19.710 --> 00:27:21.640
to be for work for
free with a car.

00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:24.382
And then the dot
com bubble burst.

00:27:24.382 --> 00:27:25.340
I had sold the company.

00:27:25.340 --> 00:27:28.500
But the bubble burst,
and no longer was

00:27:28.500 --> 00:27:31.870
it $10,000 to $20,000 with
no inventory on the 101.

00:27:31.870 --> 00:27:35.580
So the model kept going,
but essentially, I

00:27:35.580 --> 00:27:37.080
kept following my
passions about how

00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:39.530
do I do things that
can benefit humanity?

00:27:39.530 --> 00:27:41.464
Whether or not you like
advertising or not,

00:27:41.464 --> 00:27:42.880
that's a whole
other conversation.

00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:44.840
But the fact of how
do you get people

00:27:44.840 --> 00:27:46.710
into a free car, which
is really important

00:27:46.710 --> 00:27:49.070
if you need to get to work.

00:27:49.070 --> 00:27:53.310
But it really changed
when I started

00:27:53.310 --> 00:27:54.600
volunteering for the X Prize.

00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:55.400
And I'll talk about that.

00:27:55.400 --> 00:27:57.191
There's been a whole
bunch of other things,

00:27:57.191 --> 00:27:58.990
from going to Cuba and
being on TV in Peru

00:27:58.990 --> 00:28:00.430
and doing a lot of stuff.

00:28:00.430 --> 00:28:03.571
But when I volunteered
for the X Prize--

00:28:03.571 --> 00:28:06.070
and how many people have heard
of the X Prize at this point?

00:28:06.070 --> 00:28:08.070
How many people have seen
the SpaceShipOne model

00:28:08.070 --> 00:28:10.570
in building 43?

00:28:10.570 --> 00:28:14.040
So when I went to work
for them, originally, I

00:28:14.040 --> 00:28:15.390
wasn't a space geek.

00:28:15.390 --> 00:28:18.240
And I say that with much love
now, because most of my friends

00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:19.530
are space geeks.

00:28:19.530 --> 00:28:21.410
But I did see
something happening

00:28:21.410 --> 00:28:23.335
in the private spaceflight
industry, which

00:28:23.335 --> 00:28:25.460
was all these amazing people
were getting involved.

00:28:25.460 --> 00:28:27.752
So I went from being
a passive observer--

00:28:27.752 --> 00:28:29.960
like, oh, this is cool, this
is going on with space--

00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:33.120
to actually an active
seeker of the information.

00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:37.010
And in the summer of
2004, I was getting

00:28:37.010 --> 00:28:41.480
burnt out on grassroots
presidential campaign

00:28:41.480 --> 00:28:43.530
that I worked on
when we accumulated

00:28:43.530 --> 00:28:46.560
about 10,000 volunteers in LA.

00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:48.860
And that's where I met
Molly and Jennifer.

00:28:48.860 --> 00:28:50.350
And we worked on the campaign.

00:28:50.350 --> 00:28:51.980
And I get burnt out on that.

00:28:51.980 --> 00:28:53.740
And then I was really
getting involved

00:28:53.740 --> 00:28:55.110
with-- I loved this space idea.

00:28:55.110 --> 00:28:58.109
So first thing that I
did is I said, OK, I'm

00:28:58.109 --> 00:28:59.150
going to start a company.

00:28:59.150 --> 00:29:00.108
Let's democratize this.

00:29:00.108 --> 00:29:00.990
This is crazy.

00:29:00.990 --> 00:29:03.680
Not everyone can pay $100
or $2,000 to go to space.

00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:05.290
So I'm like space dreams.

00:29:05.290 --> 00:29:07.860
And then over the weekend,
I coded up a website.

00:29:07.860 --> 00:29:10.650
And I was like, there
will be a lottery system.

00:29:10.650 --> 00:29:14.740
You either pay $100 with 1,000
people and you maybe get to go.

00:29:14.740 --> 00:29:16.030
Or 100 people at $1,000.

00:29:16.030 --> 00:29:18.510
So over the weekend,
I coded it up.

00:29:18.510 --> 00:29:20.980
And my wife has always
been super passionate

00:29:20.980 --> 00:29:24.160
with my weekend business ideas.

00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:27.635
There was safe masks when we
had the problem with SARS.

00:29:27.635 --> 00:29:29.600
That was a weekend one
I decided not to do,

00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:32.940
because business was good when--
it's like the funeral business.

00:29:32.940 --> 00:29:33.524
So I said, no.

00:29:33.524 --> 00:29:34.690
That's not a good one to do.

00:29:34.690 --> 00:29:37.220
But anyways, I got involved in
the space the space industry

00:29:37.220 --> 00:29:40.080
and learning about it and I
joined the X Prize Foundation.

00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:43.370
At the time, Peter, who's
an amazing salesman,

00:29:43.370 --> 00:29:45.384
he said, oh, we need a
chief marketing officer.

00:29:45.384 --> 00:29:46.175
And you'd be great.

00:29:46.175 --> 00:29:46.799
You'd be great.

00:29:46.799 --> 00:29:47.900
But we have no money.

00:29:47.900 --> 00:29:50.030
And so I said, that's OK.

00:29:50.030 --> 00:29:53.160
I'll volunteer for four months.

00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:56.450
And I turned away a great
job back in New York,

00:29:56.450 --> 00:29:58.510
but I never wanted to
move back to New York.

00:29:58.510 --> 00:29:59.900
And so I said, let's just do it.

00:29:59.900 --> 00:30:01.452
This is too good not to do.

00:30:01.452 --> 00:30:03.160
And so I said, I'll
give you four months,

00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:05.844
and we'll see what happens
after the election.

00:30:05.844 --> 00:30:07.260
And then we'll
take it from there.

00:30:07.260 --> 00:30:10.520
And with that four months,
it was just a fantastic

00:30:10.520 --> 00:30:12.580
experience.

00:30:12.580 --> 00:30:15.156
The foundation was
basically bankrupt.

00:30:15.156 --> 00:30:16.780
But we had a whole
bunch of volunteers.

00:30:16.780 --> 00:30:18.988
And the way that the foundation
was run at the time--

00:30:18.988 --> 00:30:20.870
it was a two-bedroom apartment.

00:30:20.870 --> 00:30:23.972
And there was a bunch of
people from International Space

00:30:23.972 --> 00:30:25.680
University, which
Peter had helped start.

00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:27.720
And they would just kind
of come in any time.

00:30:27.720 --> 00:30:29.440
And they would just land there.

00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:30.700
And they would be hanging out.

00:30:30.700 --> 00:30:32.310
And then we'd have
something to do.

00:30:32.310 --> 00:30:34.340
And Peter we come in
and basically would

00:30:34.340 --> 00:30:36.070
say, OK, who wants to do this?

00:30:36.070 --> 00:30:38.880
Not any questions about who has
the ability or anything else--

00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:40.300
and someone would
go, I'll do it.

00:30:40.300 --> 00:30:42.550
And then they would just
kind of run with it.

00:30:42.550 --> 00:30:44.133
And it might get
done or it might not.

00:30:44.133 --> 00:30:46.870
But coming from more of
a business background

00:30:46.870 --> 00:30:48.360
and more of a
process orientation,

00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:51.174
it was a little interesting
organic organization

00:30:51.174 --> 00:30:51.840
to be a part of.

00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:57.390
But after the winning of the
spaceship-- of the X Prize,

00:30:57.390 --> 00:31:01.230
I was fortunate to have two
teddy bears on SpaceShipOne.

00:31:01.230 --> 00:31:03.020
I get put some ballast on it.

00:31:03.020 --> 00:31:06.680
And so my wife had two teddy
bears, Huggy [INAUDIBLE]

00:31:06.680 --> 00:31:07.620
and another one.

00:31:07.620 --> 00:31:08.370
I forget the name.

00:31:08.370 --> 00:31:11.640
But one looked like her, and
one kind of looked like me.

00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:14.240
And it wasn't a lot
of ballast, but it

00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:16.331
was something cute
to put on board.

00:31:16.331 --> 00:31:17.830
So we still have
those and they have

00:31:17.830 --> 00:31:21.790
stickers on the back of them
now that these teddy bears flew

00:31:21.790 --> 00:31:23.390
to space.

00:31:23.390 --> 00:31:27.340
And then to just fast
forward, after the winning

00:31:27.340 --> 00:31:31.960
of the X Prize by Burt Rutan and
his team, the model switched.

00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:38.730
And I went from doing 20% time
to 80%, and I joined full time.

00:31:38.730 --> 00:31:42.750
Larry hosted us here
for a tech talk.

00:31:42.750 --> 00:31:44.750
We asked him to join
the board that day.

00:31:44.750 --> 00:31:46.666
And then Peter and I,
over the next two years,

00:31:46.666 --> 00:31:49.400
built the board out to be one
of the best boards in the world

00:31:49.400 --> 00:31:51.780
and figured out a strategy of
how to create a-- actually,

00:31:51.780 --> 00:31:53.654
Larry really challenged
to us with how do you

00:31:53.654 --> 00:31:56.095
create a prize institute
that can do lots of prizes?

00:31:56.095 --> 00:31:57.970
So he loved prizes, but
he loved the leverage

00:31:57.970 --> 00:32:00.172
of building a prize
institute that does a lot.

00:32:00.172 --> 00:32:01.380
So I stayed there for awhile.

00:32:01.380 --> 00:32:03.095
And then I've continued
down that path

00:32:03.095 --> 00:32:05.470
to find things that I'm super
passionate about that I can

00:32:05.470 --> 00:32:08.750
focus my energy on
and be supportive.

00:32:08.750 --> 00:32:11.047
And then the 20% time
are things like-- they

00:32:11.047 --> 00:32:11.880
keep getting better.

00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:14.400
The 20% time keeps getting
better, which is-- remember,

00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:16.410
the 20% now is the work time.

00:32:16.410 --> 00:32:19.470
But I've found a way to make
the work time more pleasurable.

00:32:19.470 --> 00:32:22.950
So my 20% time now is I do
property development in Maui.

00:32:25.790 --> 00:32:28.140
So it's a much more
stable long term.

00:32:28.140 --> 00:32:31.090
And I have to go there
every several weeks, which

00:32:31.090 --> 00:32:33.049
is horrible.

00:32:33.049 --> 00:32:35.340
But the point is that I've
tried to switch that around.

00:32:35.340 --> 00:32:38.550
And one other connection in
point-- and I'll end on this--

00:32:38.550 --> 00:32:42.210
is I've been working with
Jenny now for over a year.

00:32:42.210 --> 00:32:46.270
And I joined with a
friend of both of ours

00:32:46.270 --> 00:32:49.200
and we launched a prize,
a longevity prize.

00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:53.000
And so my 80% time now
is primarily focused on--

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:55.520
besides some startups I work
with-- primarily focused

00:32:55.520 --> 00:32:59.930
on longevity and seeing what we
can do to speed the clock up,

00:32:59.930 --> 00:33:05.630
because I have this feeling
that it will happen sometime.

00:33:05.630 --> 00:33:06.890
We will crack the code.

00:33:06.890 --> 00:33:09.360
And it doesn't mean
necessarily that it's eternal.

00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:11.820
But we will crack the
code where we understand

00:33:11.820 --> 00:33:14.570
how to restore homeostatic
capacity, where we can start

00:33:14.570 --> 00:33:16.735
to self heal and we live
longer and healthier.

00:33:16.735 --> 00:33:18.110
And actually, it's
the other way.

00:33:18.110 --> 00:33:20.235
We live healthier, and as
a result, we live longer.

00:33:20.235 --> 00:33:22.900
And so we worked on building
this prize over the past year.

00:33:22.900 --> 00:33:24.680
It's a $1 million prize.

00:33:24.680 --> 00:33:26.840
We have 20 teams
competing from a variety

00:33:26.840 --> 00:33:30.020
of different backgrounds--
different approaches, from stem

00:33:30.020 --> 00:33:32.610
cell to genetics to optics.

00:33:32.610 --> 00:33:34.470
And it's been super exciting.

00:33:34.470 --> 00:33:37.820
And now, as an
offshoot of that, we're

00:33:37.820 --> 00:33:41.540
launching an international
profit that will be an umbrella

00:33:41.540 --> 00:33:43.880
organization to raise funding,
because one of the things

00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:45.590
we've learned, just
like with most science,

00:33:45.590 --> 00:33:47.810
is that there's not enough
money that's going in there,

00:33:47.810 --> 00:33:50.351
and that the NIH money that goes
in there is about $1 billion

00:33:50.351 --> 00:33:51.970
a year, but it's very low risk.

00:33:51.970 --> 00:33:55.600
And so there's
some amazing people

00:33:55.600 --> 00:33:57.330
working in labs all
over this world.

00:33:57.330 --> 00:33:58.890
They don't have enough funding.

00:33:58.890 --> 00:34:00.780
And so what they end
up doing is they end up

00:34:00.780 --> 00:34:02.905
applying for grants in
areas that they don't really

00:34:02.905 --> 00:34:03.780
want to work in.

00:34:03.780 --> 00:34:05.600
And it's the worst
thing that you can do.

00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:07.765
And so these folks
are in there for 50,

00:34:07.765 --> 00:34:11.370
80-- we have some of our teams
who are 60, 75 years old.

00:34:11.370 --> 00:34:13.739
And they do amazing
work every single day.

00:34:13.739 --> 00:34:14.989
And they're not doing
it because of the money.

00:34:14.989 --> 00:34:16.020
They're doing because
they want to find

00:34:16.020 --> 00:34:17.679
a breakthrough for humanity.

00:34:17.679 --> 00:34:21.440
And so anyways, I guess my
takeaway is I think all of us

00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:24.449
have personal stories
of success in tragedies.

00:34:24.449 --> 00:34:29.440
And I think embracing the
successes and the things you're

00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:32.840
passionate about and
overcoming the challenges is

00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:34.716
really important.

00:34:34.716 --> 00:34:37.370
And so thanks for having me.

00:34:37.370 --> 00:34:39.242
And it's great to be here.

00:34:39.242 --> 00:34:41.928
[APPLAUSE]

00:34:41.928 --> 00:34:43.178
MOLLY LAVIK: Thank you, Keith.

00:34:43.178 --> 00:34:44.639
Thank you for sharing that.

00:34:44.639 --> 00:34:46.699
Congratulations to you
both on that prize.

00:34:46.699 --> 00:34:47.550
That's amazing.

00:34:47.550 --> 00:34:48.910
KEITH POWERS: Actually, I'm 90.

00:34:48.910 --> 00:34:49.540
And she's--

00:34:49.540 --> 00:34:50.248
JENNY ALDEN: 110.

00:34:50.248 --> 00:34:53.980
KEITH POWERS: She's 110.

00:34:53.980 --> 00:34:55.800
MOLLY LAVIK: And
Keith will also be

00:34:55.800 --> 00:34:58.390
back up in a moment
for our Q&amp;A. And now,

00:34:58.390 --> 00:35:01.940
for our grand finale and our
host tonight, Jeff Rozic--

00:35:01.940 --> 00:35:04.990
and I just have to take
a moment and tell you

00:35:04.990 --> 00:35:07.540
that when Jeff was a
student in my class,

00:35:07.540 --> 00:35:10.060
he was like no other student.

00:35:10.060 --> 00:35:13.940
I knew that I was witnessing
one of the most brilliant people

00:35:13.940 --> 00:35:15.000
out there.

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:18.900
And when he graduated, I put
him on my board of directors,

00:35:18.900 --> 00:35:21.590
and it was one of the
best days of my life.

00:35:21.590 --> 00:35:24.240
And he has been very
generous with sharing

00:35:24.240 --> 00:35:25.990
his brilliance all these years.

00:35:25.990 --> 00:35:27.625
And I can't wait
to hear his talk,

00:35:27.625 --> 00:35:30.630
and thank you for letting me
share your story in the book.

00:35:30.630 --> 00:35:32.834
And so everyone, Jeff Rozic.

00:35:32.834 --> 00:35:34.840
[APPLAUSE]

00:35:34.840 --> 00:35:36.840
JEFF ROZIC: I wanted to
come in with some really

00:35:36.840 --> 00:35:40.220
low expectations after the
last panelists and promise

00:35:40.220 --> 00:35:42.870
that, as Jenny joked, when
Molly called and started

00:35:42.870 --> 00:35:45.120
talking about a book
about super achievers,

00:35:45.120 --> 00:35:48.200
I thought, well, let me see if
I can introduce you to some.

00:35:48.200 --> 00:35:51.640
And as I got to understand
the project she was working on

00:35:51.640 --> 00:35:54.730
and think back about all the
people I've met through Molly

00:35:54.730 --> 00:35:57.240
and then also from what I'd
learned through Molly, which

00:35:57.240 --> 00:36:01.540
is just to approach people
and forge natural connections

00:36:01.540 --> 00:36:03.560
with people and work
in personal life

00:36:03.560 --> 00:36:06.522
and so on-- which is something
I truly learned from Molly--

00:36:06.522 --> 00:36:08.980
I thought, well, maybe I have
a little bit of a story here.

00:36:08.980 --> 00:36:10.137
Let me think about it.

00:36:10.137 --> 00:36:12.470
And if you read the book--
and this is a debt definitely

00:36:12.470 --> 00:36:14.540
a plug for the
book-- some patterns

00:36:14.540 --> 00:36:16.360
start to emerge, I
think, that Molly,

00:36:16.360 --> 00:36:19.090
who gravitates toward super
achievers in her life,

00:36:19.090 --> 00:36:21.930
has figured out a handful
of characteristics of people

00:36:21.930 --> 00:36:23.850
who consistently achieve things.

00:36:23.850 --> 00:36:26.220
And I think the only
one that I could maybe

00:36:26.220 --> 00:36:28.270
boast a little right
to play on is one

00:36:28.270 --> 00:36:30.840
that we might call not being
afraid to push yourself

00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:32.480
outside of your comfort zone.

00:36:32.480 --> 00:36:33.938
I think that's
something you'd find

00:36:33.938 --> 00:36:35.960
in a lot of people
who just go for it.

00:36:35.960 --> 00:36:37.751
And I think you've
heard an element of that

00:36:37.751 --> 00:36:39.140
in everyone's story tonight.

00:36:39.140 --> 00:36:41.400
For me, my quick
version of that story

00:36:41.400 --> 00:36:44.610
is I didn't grow up in an
uncomfortable zone at all.

00:36:44.610 --> 00:36:47.297
Thanks to my parents, I grew up
in a pretty comfortable Midwest

00:36:47.297 --> 00:36:48.130
suburban upbringing.

00:36:48.130 --> 00:36:50.169
I had educational opportunities.

00:36:50.169 --> 00:36:52.210
I started off in life
wanting to be a journalist.

00:36:52.210 --> 00:36:55.252
But I had a premonition
that Guy would say,

00:36:55.252 --> 00:36:56.960
writing is not all
it's cracked up to be,

00:36:56.960 --> 00:36:59.170
sometime down the road.

00:36:59.170 --> 00:37:02.149
But I was on a very typical
path through school.

00:37:02.149 --> 00:37:04.440
And so the only thing that
was really interesting to me

00:37:04.440 --> 00:37:06.700
growing up in Ohio
was this dot com thing

00:37:06.700 --> 00:37:09.420
that was starting to happen
in the early to mid '90s,

00:37:09.420 --> 00:37:11.570
and definitely in the later
'90s on the west coast.

00:37:11.570 --> 00:37:13.471
So I was in college
in Cleveland.

00:37:13.471 --> 00:37:14.970
And I had started
scheming about how

00:37:14.970 --> 00:37:17.780
to get out to the west
coast, the digital media

00:37:17.780 --> 00:37:19.780
and entertainment
startup hub that

00:37:19.780 --> 00:37:22.730
was first time through
building in America.

00:37:22.730 --> 00:37:25.840
So I started packing all my
credits into a few semesters

00:37:25.840 --> 00:37:27.900
so I could take some
time off and get

00:37:27.900 --> 00:37:30.320
an internship in California.

00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:32.940
And I remember firing
off 1,000 or more emails

00:37:32.940 --> 00:37:33.970
to pursue an internship.

00:37:33.970 --> 00:37:36.270
And I found one with a
technology incubator,

00:37:36.270 --> 00:37:39.950
which is a relatively new idea,
at least in the dot com version

00:37:39.950 --> 00:37:42.300
that we're now pretty
familiar with-- incubators

00:37:42.300 --> 00:37:43.400
and accelerators.

00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:46.150
This was late '90s, early 2000s

00:37:46.150 --> 00:37:47.170
And I had it all set up.

00:37:47.170 --> 00:37:49.170
And then by the time that
January rolled around,

00:37:49.170 --> 00:37:51.170
where I was supposed to
move out here and do it,

00:37:51.170 --> 00:37:53.210
of course, as we've
all invoked tonight,

00:37:53.210 --> 00:37:55.470
the first business
setback occurred.

00:37:55.470 --> 00:37:57.357
And that was the first
dot com meltdown.

00:37:57.357 --> 00:37:58.440
The incubator was no more.

00:37:58.440 --> 00:38:00.120
The internship was no more.

00:38:00.120 --> 00:38:01.400
And so I just finished school.

00:38:01.400 --> 00:38:03.525
And I had to try to find
the most interesting job I

00:38:03.525 --> 00:38:04.220
could find.

00:38:04.220 --> 00:38:08.355
And probably the one sub thread
through my life of getting out

00:38:08.355 --> 00:38:10.739
of my comfort zone is pursuing
working with startups.

00:38:10.739 --> 00:38:13.030
There's no better way to get
uncomfortable than go work

00:38:13.030 --> 00:38:13.950
for a startup.

00:38:13.950 --> 00:38:15.700
And the most
interesting one I could

00:38:15.700 --> 00:38:17.575
find in the Midwest at
the time was a company

00:38:17.575 --> 00:38:19.200
that was making
the anthrax vaccine

00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:21.033
and selling it to the
Department of Defense.

00:38:21.033 --> 00:38:23.710
And that was a very
big topic at that time,

00:38:23.710 --> 00:38:26.400
better than working in the
funeral business, I would say,

00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:28.870
but not a whole lot better,
especially in the 9/11 time

00:38:28.870 --> 00:38:30.161
frame that we're talking about.

00:38:30.161 --> 00:38:31.630
So this company
ended up being one

00:38:31.630 --> 00:38:33.254
of the best startups
a ever worked for.

00:38:33.254 --> 00:38:35.670
It was an old
privatized state lab

00:38:35.670 --> 00:38:38.270
that became a commercial
venture, a private company,

00:38:38.270 --> 00:38:40.280
and later IPO'ed,
and is now a company

00:38:40.280 --> 00:38:43.100
called Emergent BioSolutions,
full of the people that Keith

00:38:43.100 --> 00:38:45.980
described, which are incredible
scientists doing work

00:38:45.980 --> 00:38:48.244
all across the bio sciences.

00:38:48.244 --> 00:38:49.660
And it was just a
great experience

00:38:49.660 --> 00:38:51.900
to put myself in positions--
project managing,

00:38:51.900 --> 00:38:55.420
scientific research
projects-- I couldn't even

00:38:55.420 --> 00:38:57.427
get through astronomy
101, and not

00:38:57.427 --> 00:38:59.510
I'm working with brilliant
world class scientists,

00:38:59.510 --> 00:39:01.550
and just trying to get
out of my comfort zone

00:39:01.550 --> 00:39:04.535
and be around brilliant
people at all times.

00:39:04.535 --> 00:39:06.160
And then I went back
to business school

00:39:06.160 --> 00:39:09.280
and I met a whole bunch
more people like Molly.

00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:11.820
And I chose to do that in
Southern California-- again,

00:39:11.820 --> 00:39:14.440
this inclination to get
out here in California

00:39:14.440 --> 00:39:18.070
and be part of all these amazing
technology themes and trends

00:39:18.070 --> 00:39:21.990
that were happening, now in
the mid 2000s, I guess-- 2004,

00:39:21.990 --> 00:39:23.360
2005.

00:39:23.360 --> 00:39:26.560
And after business school, I had
an opportunity to join Google.

00:39:26.560 --> 00:39:28.660
And that one, I guess,
you wouldn't say

00:39:28.660 --> 00:39:30.160
is getting out of
your comfort zone.

00:39:30.160 --> 00:39:33.200
It's very much a desirable job
coming out of an MBA program.

00:39:33.200 --> 00:39:35.130
So it was kind of a
no-brainer for me.

00:39:35.130 --> 00:39:36.980
But it was also the
best of both worlds,

00:39:36.980 --> 00:39:39.570
because we're trying to do
something very uncomfortable,

00:39:39.570 --> 00:39:43.100
which was sell radio advertising
through Google AdWords

00:39:43.100 --> 00:39:44.790
platform, advertising platform.

00:39:44.790 --> 00:39:47.710
And I just really love this
idea of a disruptive technology.

00:39:47.710 --> 00:39:50.114
And that was a great
experience for a couple years.

00:39:50.114 --> 00:39:51.530
And then I actually
chose to leave

00:39:51.530 --> 00:39:53.450
Google to work for
a much earlier stage

00:39:53.450 --> 00:39:55.099
company in a bigger
marketing role.

00:39:55.099 --> 00:39:57.640
And that's a pattern I've had
a couple times over the years--

00:39:57.640 --> 00:40:01.840
to go seek out a more high risk,
high reward type situation.

00:40:01.840 --> 00:40:04.170
We're treated extremely
well here at Google,

00:40:04.170 --> 00:40:05.880
as you probably know
if you work here

00:40:05.880 --> 00:40:06.840
and if you've heard about it.

00:40:06.840 --> 00:40:09.131
It's very true, everything
you read about this company.

00:40:09.131 --> 00:40:11.250
It's an incredible
culture and resources.

00:40:11.250 --> 00:40:14.050
So the move to go work for a
startup is not an easy one.

00:40:14.050 --> 00:40:16.710
But there's a lot of peers in
this amazing community that

00:40:16.710 --> 00:40:18.110
choose to do that.

00:40:18.110 --> 00:40:21.370
Or better yet, go forge your
own path within this company

00:40:21.370 --> 00:40:23.640
and find a very exciting
entrepreneurial project

00:40:23.640 --> 00:40:24.720
to work on.

00:40:24.720 --> 00:40:26.320
So long story short,
I chose return

00:40:26.320 --> 00:40:31.360
to Google a few years later--
very long story, very short--

00:40:31.360 --> 00:40:33.504
after a couple rough years
in the startup world.

00:40:33.504 --> 00:40:35.670
And now, I'm doing something
called Brand Lab, which

00:40:35.670 --> 00:40:39.220
is actually at YouTube just
up the road in San Bruno.

00:40:39.220 --> 00:40:41.100
Has anyone heard of Brand Lab?

00:40:41.100 --> 00:40:43.240
It's a customer
experience center

00:40:43.240 --> 00:40:46.090
where Google's background
in the advertising world

00:40:46.090 --> 00:40:48.350
is on this incredibly
accountable form of advertising

00:40:48.350 --> 00:40:49.550
called AdWords.

00:40:49.550 --> 00:40:51.250
You always know
exactly what ROI you're

00:40:51.250 --> 00:40:52.950
getting out of your search ads.

00:40:52.950 --> 00:40:55.520
But we've forced into this
world of brand advertising

00:40:55.520 --> 00:40:57.360
which is decades
and decades old.

00:40:57.360 --> 00:41:00.190
And we've found that
we need to work really

00:41:00.190 --> 00:41:03.170
closely with our big brand
advertisers, our big customers,

00:41:03.170 --> 00:41:05.560
show them the love, show them
the brand love, as we say,

00:41:05.560 --> 00:41:07.390
and become great partners
with them as they take

00:41:07.390 --> 00:41:09.510
on digital marketing in a
sense that we could have

00:41:09.510 --> 00:41:11.110
never imagined where we are now.

00:41:11.110 --> 00:41:14.270
You have all these social
channels to manage,

00:41:14.270 --> 00:41:17.199
and all of these various
audience behaviors and profiles

00:41:17.199 --> 00:41:19.490
that we never could have
imagined even five or 10 years

00:41:19.490 --> 00:41:22.060
ago across devices
and across content

00:41:22.060 --> 00:41:23.232
that we love to consume.

00:41:23.232 --> 00:41:25.690
So we're in there every single
day in the Brand Lab working

00:41:25.690 --> 00:41:29.010
with our best brand advertisers
to figure out how to reach

00:41:29.010 --> 00:41:30.700
and how to engage
this digital audience.

00:41:30.700 --> 00:41:32.230
And it's a big
challenge right now.

00:41:32.230 --> 00:41:35.410
It's probably a safer challenge
than I've sought in years past,

00:41:35.410 --> 00:41:37.920
because I've gone into some
very risky startup situations.

00:41:37.920 --> 00:41:40.390
And right now, I've all
the comforts and excitement

00:41:40.390 --> 00:41:43.120
of working for Google and having
access to these world class

00:41:43.120 --> 00:41:45.270
brands and all these
great marketing teams who

00:41:45.270 --> 00:41:46.720
come through our
doors every day.

00:41:46.720 --> 00:41:49.910
I don't take that for granted
at all, although I can't help

00:41:49.910 --> 00:41:52.560
but wonder, when will the next
time be that I kind of a push

00:41:52.560 --> 00:41:54.149
myself out of the comfort zone?

00:41:54.149 --> 00:41:56.440
So it's also been a little
bit easier for me, probably,

00:41:56.440 --> 00:41:58.574
because I've had
a very easygoing,

00:41:58.574 --> 00:42:00.990
compared to some of the other
stories we've heard tonight,

00:42:00.990 --> 00:42:02.490
on the personal side of life.

00:42:02.490 --> 00:42:05.260
And my wife, we've been
together for about 17 years,

00:42:05.260 --> 00:42:07.070
believe it or not--
not married that long.

00:42:07.070 --> 00:42:09.520
We didn't get married in
third or fourth grade.

00:42:09.520 --> 00:42:12.107
But we've been together
for a very long time

00:42:12.107 --> 00:42:13.440
since growing up in high school.

00:42:13.440 --> 00:42:15.460
So we've got on these
life adventures together.

00:42:15.460 --> 00:42:16.900
And that definitely
makes it very easy.

00:42:16.900 --> 00:42:18.483
Sometimes, we just
look at each other,

00:42:18.483 --> 00:42:20.430
having moved back
to the Bay Area,

00:42:20.430 --> 00:42:22.630
moving all around Boulder,
Colorado, and Southern

00:42:22.630 --> 00:42:24.470
California, we just
look at each other,

00:42:24.470 --> 00:42:25.800
like what are we doing here?

00:42:25.800 --> 00:42:26.800
We have two kids now.

00:42:26.800 --> 00:42:28.420
And when are we going to start
moving around and seeking

00:42:28.420 --> 00:42:29.795
new adventures
and opportunities?

00:42:29.795 --> 00:42:31.570
But I guess we kind
of share that DNA

00:42:31.570 --> 00:42:34.550
to pursue-- the pursuit
of the uncomfortable

00:42:34.550 --> 00:42:36.940
and always to try to test
yourself in new situations.

00:42:36.940 --> 00:42:38.440
So that's the only
thread that I can

00:42:38.440 --> 00:42:41.890
find to justify my inclusion in
a book like "Going Supernova."

00:42:41.890 --> 00:42:44.160
But if that's truly a
trait, part of the DNA,

00:42:44.160 --> 00:42:46.740
of an achiever,
then I will gladly

00:42:46.740 --> 00:42:48.727
position myself for that one.

00:42:48.727 --> 00:42:50.560
So thanks again for
listening to that story.

00:42:50.560 --> 00:42:51.768
MOLLY LAVIK: Thank you, Jeff.

00:42:51.768 --> 00:42:53.045
Thank you for being here, too.

00:42:53.045 --> 00:42:54.536
Thank you for making it.

00:42:54.536 --> 00:42:57.210
Thank you, Jeff, for hosting
and making it possible.

00:42:57.210 --> 00:43:01.310
We're going to get into the Q&amp;A.
I need to, of course, though,

00:43:01.310 --> 00:43:03.780
thank Valeria, my
very dear friend,

00:43:03.780 --> 00:43:06.092
who really tonight--
I wouldn't have

00:43:06.092 --> 00:43:07.550
gotten through
tonight without her.

00:43:07.550 --> 00:43:09.380
She has saved the
day about 40 times.

00:43:09.380 --> 00:43:10.720
Thank you, Valeria, so much.

00:43:10.720 --> 00:43:14.640
[APPLAUSE]

00:43:14.640 --> 00:43:17.450
So before we start
the Q&amp;A, I just

00:43:17.450 --> 00:43:20.510
wanted to say that I am
dedicated to helping each

00:43:20.510 --> 00:43:23.290
and every one of you
with your major goals.

00:43:23.290 --> 00:43:26.000
And there's not
just the book if you

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:27.870
to decide to get a
copy of the book.

00:43:27.870 --> 00:43:32.150
But I've put together an entire
mentorinsight.net tool kit

00:43:32.150 --> 00:43:36.590
to help anyone, no matter where
you are at life, super achieve.

00:43:36.590 --> 00:43:40.960
And there's an app called Gusto
Career Coach available now

00:43:40.960 --> 00:43:44.900
on the iPhone, and hopefully,
very soon on the Android,

00:43:44.900 --> 00:43:46.640
as well.

00:43:46.640 --> 00:43:48.800
I hope you will take
advantage of these programs.

00:43:48.800 --> 00:43:51.990
They're really inexpensive
and they're there to help you.

00:43:51.990 --> 00:43:54.500
And call me if I can
ever be of help to you,

00:43:54.500 --> 00:43:56.070
because I really do care.

00:43:56.070 --> 00:43:58.300
So I know you have
some questions

00:43:58.300 --> 00:44:01.280
and you've patiently waited.

00:44:01.280 --> 00:44:04.970
So who would like to ask
the first question tonight?

00:44:04.970 --> 00:44:07.615
AUDIENCE: The question I
have-- in your new book, "Art

00:44:07.615 --> 00:44:11.420
of Social," you advocated for
giving away your book freely

00:44:11.420 --> 00:44:12.750
to get bigger distribution.

00:44:12.750 --> 00:44:16.130
How do you decide that yourself,
as to what's a good fit?

00:44:16.130 --> 00:44:19.050
Or do you just do it if
the opportunity presents

00:44:19.050 --> 00:44:21.920
and it survives your
black email box maybe?

00:44:21.920 --> 00:44:23.090
GUY KAWASAKI: Yeah.

00:44:23.090 --> 00:44:28.490
So in the final three
months or so of a book,

00:44:28.490 --> 00:44:33.150
when the Word manuscript is
basically more or less done,

00:44:33.150 --> 00:44:36.520
at least in my mind,
I send out a message

00:44:36.520 --> 00:44:41.270
through all my social media
channels requesting editors.

00:44:41.270 --> 00:44:44.610
Some are volunteer
content and copy editors.

00:44:44.610 --> 00:44:48.740
So this announcement goes
to about 10 million people.

00:44:48.740 --> 00:44:54.970
And about 500 people say
yes, they want to do it.

00:44:54.970 --> 00:44:57.820
I send out 500 people
the Word document.

00:44:57.820 --> 00:45:01.825
And about 100 actually
write the comment

00:45:01.825 --> 00:45:06.080
and send me back-- hundreds,
literally hundreds of comments.

00:45:06.080 --> 00:45:09.650
So I open up each Word
document one at a time.

00:45:09.650 --> 00:45:12.630
I've turned on Track Comments.

00:45:12.630 --> 00:45:15.900
And I look at every
single comment.

00:45:15.900 --> 00:45:17.780
And I fix every one.

00:45:17.780 --> 00:45:20.660
So one of things I learned is
I send this out in batches,

00:45:20.660 --> 00:45:24.470
because I don't send it out
to all 2,000 people at once,

00:45:24.470 --> 00:45:28.410
because if I did that, then
they'd all find the same comma,

00:45:28.410 --> 00:45:28.980
that's wrong.

00:45:28.980 --> 00:45:32.080
So I want people to find
different bugs every time.

00:45:32.080 --> 00:45:33.340
So I send it out in stages.

00:45:33.340 --> 00:45:34.700
So I do that.

00:45:34.700 --> 00:45:37.190
And then I have
to-- funny Story.

00:45:37.190 --> 00:45:38.710
So I've done this several times.

00:45:38.710 --> 00:45:41.280
And you'd think, well,
with hundreds of people

00:45:41.280 --> 00:45:46.010
and me reading it 50
times, by the time

00:45:46.010 --> 00:45:47.910
I send it to copy
edit, it's perfect.

00:45:47.910 --> 00:45:50.980
And every time I do this, I
expect the copy editor to say,

00:45:50.980 --> 00:45:53.940
in my 30 years of
copy editing, I

00:45:53.940 --> 00:45:55.890
have never seen a
perfect book till today.

00:45:55.890 --> 00:45:57.210
OK?

00:45:57.210 --> 00:45:58.550
So guess what happens.

00:45:58.550 --> 00:46:00.540
I send this book out.

00:46:00.540 --> 00:46:02.470
And I kid you not, OK?

00:46:02.470 --> 00:46:03.360
I kid you not.

00:46:03.360 --> 00:46:08.810
It comes back with
2,500 corrections.

00:46:08.810 --> 00:46:11.175
And I am just
freaking astounded.

00:46:11.175 --> 00:46:12.050
Now, how can this be?

00:46:12.050 --> 00:46:13.890
Now, obviously, the
way she counts--

00:46:13.890 --> 00:46:17.150
if a comma is in the wrong
place, when she cuts, it's one.

00:46:17.150 --> 00:46:18.950
She puts it back, it's two.

00:46:18.950 --> 00:46:20.470
So let's be conservative.

00:46:20.470 --> 00:46:24.350
Let's say it's 1,250 problems.

00:46:24.350 --> 00:46:26.240
Still, my mind is boggled.

00:46:26.240 --> 00:46:27.700
So anyway, that goes through.

00:46:27.700 --> 00:46:28.830
So now, it's PDF.

00:46:28.830 --> 00:46:30.650
It's truly final.

00:46:30.650 --> 00:46:32.390
And then what I do
is I say, all right,

00:46:32.390 --> 00:46:35.990
so anybody who will
review the book,

00:46:35.990 --> 00:46:39.220
I will send the
PDF to right now.

00:46:39.220 --> 00:46:43.060
And what happens then is you
get another 2,000 or so people.

00:46:43.060 --> 00:46:47.540
And all I ask is that they
fill out an online database

00:46:47.540 --> 00:46:50.270
where they put their
website or blog

00:46:50.270 --> 00:46:54.370
and approximate
monthly page views.

00:46:54.370 --> 00:46:59.360
And just between all
of us, I never check.

00:46:59.360 --> 00:47:02.200
I just want people-- if they're
really trying to steal a copy,

00:47:02.200 --> 00:47:05.230
I want them to
have to lie and say

00:47:05.230 --> 00:47:07.060
that they have this
blog or this website

00:47:07.060 --> 00:47:09.050
and they get two
million views a month.

00:47:09.050 --> 00:47:11.380
So I never check
that, literally.

00:47:11.380 --> 00:47:13.710
So then I send this
out to everybody.

00:47:13.710 --> 00:47:19.000
And then of those 2,000 people,
maybe 200 or so write a review.

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:22.080
And the way I figure it out,
if you ever write a book,

00:47:22.080 --> 00:47:26.030
if you want to guarantee first
day great reviews on Amazon,

00:47:26.030 --> 00:47:27.330
this is what you do.

00:47:27.330 --> 00:47:29.350
So Amazon turns it
on-- you'll know

00:47:29.350 --> 00:47:31.680
what day-- at midnight Pacific.

00:47:31.680 --> 00:47:33.990
So at about 7:00 PM
Pacific that night,

00:47:33.990 --> 00:47:36.300
you send an email to
2,000 of these people who

00:47:36.300 --> 00:47:39.040
promise to review it
and your beta testers.

00:47:39.040 --> 00:47:41.310
And you say, listen, it's
going live in four hours.

00:47:41.310 --> 00:47:44.260
Amazon will not let you post
the review till it's live.

00:47:44.260 --> 00:47:46.130
So in four hours,
it's going live.

00:47:46.130 --> 00:47:49.360
I would really appreciate it if
you'd go and immediately review

00:47:49.360 --> 00:47:51.780
it, because I want to
get off to a fast start.

00:47:51.780 --> 00:47:52.540
OK?

00:47:52.540 --> 00:47:54.460
I go to sleep and wake
up the next morning,

00:47:54.460 --> 00:47:56.600
200 five star reviews.

00:47:56.600 --> 00:47:59.180
And so that's what I did.

00:47:59.180 --> 00:48:03.350
Now, I can't tell you that I was
completely open and transparent

00:48:03.350 --> 00:48:08.420
with my publisher, because just
suffice it to say that New York

00:48:08.420 --> 00:48:12.730
publishers are not theoretically
trying to seed a lot of copies.

00:48:12.730 --> 00:48:15.180
There's an institution
called Net Galley

00:48:15.180 --> 00:48:18.940
where you go to NetGalley,
you register to be a tester,

00:48:18.940 --> 00:48:22.840
and then you can get the book
through official DRM-protected

00:48:22.840 --> 00:48:23.520
means.

00:48:23.520 --> 00:48:28.360
So I've used hat last time,
just send them the PDF.

00:48:28.360 --> 00:48:29.870
And so that's what I do.

00:48:29.870 --> 00:48:33.720
That's the dirty
secrets of what I do.

00:48:33.720 --> 00:48:36.390
And many people are
just amazed at how

00:48:36.390 --> 00:48:39.760
I get so many reviews
in the first day.

00:48:39.760 --> 00:48:42.850
So actually, to tell
you another funny story,

00:48:42.850 --> 00:48:46.580
when I figured out
this great method,

00:48:46.580 --> 00:48:49.056
I literally have to contact
Amazon and say, listen,

00:48:49.056 --> 00:48:50.430
you're not going
to believe this,

00:48:50.430 --> 00:48:52.680
but tomorrow morning, there's
going to be 200 reviews.

00:48:52.680 --> 00:48:55.013
I don't want you to think
that I have 200 false accounts

00:48:55.013 --> 00:48:56.780
and I'm giving myself
a five star review.

00:48:56.780 --> 00:48:58.230
These people really
have read it.

00:48:58.230 --> 00:49:01.390
You have to just trust me.

00:49:01.390 --> 00:49:03.650
Otherwise, Amazon
logically would say, well,

00:49:03.650 --> 00:49:07.050
how is it that this book
has sold 100 copies,

00:49:07.050 --> 00:49:08.930
has 200 reviews?

00:49:08.930 --> 00:49:10.590
The math doesn't work out.

00:49:10.590 --> 00:49:13.680
So you have to forewarn Amazon
that this is going to happen.

00:49:13.680 --> 00:49:16.550
So that's probably more
than you wanted to know.

00:49:16.550 --> 00:49:22.150
AUDIENCE: No, I wanted to
know that and the [INAUDIBLE].

00:49:22.150 --> 00:49:22.950
GUY KAWASAKI: OK.

00:49:22.950 --> 00:49:23.450
OK.

00:49:23.450 --> 00:49:24.614
So that's what I do.

00:49:24.614 --> 00:49:26.780
AUDIENCE: So what kinds of
skills, what kind of jobs

00:49:26.780 --> 00:49:28.802
do you see in 10, 20 years?

00:49:28.802 --> 00:49:30.510
GUY KAWASAKI: You
looking at me, are you?

00:49:30.510 --> 00:49:31.135
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:49:31.135 --> 00:49:33.200
Or any of the other folks here--

00:49:33.200 --> 00:49:34.616
GUY KAWASAKI: Ask
the 90-year-old.

00:49:37.900 --> 00:49:41.890
KEITH POWERS: So
personal belief is

00:49:41.890 --> 00:49:44.112
that the more
creative kids can be

00:49:44.112 --> 00:49:45.820
who are the next
generation of workforce,

00:49:45.820 --> 00:49:48.020
the better position they'll be.

00:49:48.020 --> 00:49:51.210
I think there's a lot of
things, like basic coding

00:49:51.210 --> 00:49:54.360
and other things, that'll
be much more of a commodity.

00:49:54.360 --> 00:49:57.550
And the everyday
things that we do now

00:49:57.550 --> 00:49:59.930
will be done through
AI and through robotics

00:49:59.930 --> 00:50:00.640
and other things.

00:50:00.640 --> 00:50:03.040
So the more creative
path kids can

00:50:03.040 --> 00:50:06.190
take-- it doesn't mean that they
shouldn't know basic things.

00:50:06.190 --> 00:50:08.860
So I love that my daughter is
learning some basic coding now.

00:50:08.860 --> 00:50:11.160
But it's just to demystify it.

00:50:11.160 --> 00:50:14.170
And so when I first built my
website for-- I wasn't a coder.

00:50:14.170 --> 00:50:18.030
It was like FrontPage and it
worked-- back in the '90s,

00:50:18.030 --> 00:50:22.180
it demystified the
mystery of the web.

00:50:22.180 --> 00:50:24.470
And then I was able to
take that and move on.

00:50:24.470 --> 00:50:27.122
So personally, my
belief is that whatever

00:50:27.122 --> 00:50:28.705
you can do to make
kids super creative

00:50:28.705 --> 00:50:31.170
and think for themselves,
the better off they'll

00:50:31.170 --> 00:50:32.502
be long term.

00:50:32.502 --> 00:50:34.710
JEFF ROZIC: I think it's
really difficult to predict.

00:50:34.710 --> 00:50:36.660
That's a great question.

00:50:36.660 --> 00:50:39.780
So I'm doing something a little
bit contrarian in parenting.

00:50:39.780 --> 00:50:41.530
And that's to allow
the kids to get

00:50:41.530 --> 00:50:45.454
into a whole broad swath of
activities, where I think

00:50:45.454 --> 00:50:46.870
the modern parent
line of thinking

00:50:46.870 --> 00:50:49.290
might be get them really
focused on a programming

00:50:49.290 --> 00:50:51.950
language at age two, three,
four, somewhere in there,

00:50:51.950 --> 00:50:53.570
a sport at age two, three, four.

00:50:53.570 --> 00:50:56.170
I'm joking, of course.

00:50:56.170 --> 00:50:57.350
KEITH POWERS: Really?

00:50:57.350 --> 00:50:58.766
JEFF ROZIC: Well,
I can't program,

00:50:58.766 --> 00:51:00.290
so I can't ask them to program.

00:51:00.290 --> 00:51:02.320
But I really echo
what Keith says.

00:51:02.320 --> 00:51:05.200
And I think it applies
even beyond design,

00:51:05.200 --> 00:51:09.730
but to all kinds of, I guess,
more micro professions that

00:51:09.730 --> 00:51:11.320
are enabled by digital.

00:51:11.320 --> 00:51:13.400
But you can be a
designer, and through

00:51:13.400 --> 00:51:15.960
any number of web storefronts,
sell your products

00:51:15.960 --> 00:51:18.820
to a large enough audience
to make an income on,

00:51:18.820 --> 00:51:22.190
but nothing that a mass
brand would consider mass.

00:51:22.190 --> 00:51:26.270
And I think that same idea
could apply in education,

00:51:26.270 --> 00:51:27.130
for example.

00:51:27.130 --> 00:51:28.640
I'm a huge student of education.

00:51:28.640 --> 00:51:30.450
I watch how it
changes over time.

00:51:30.450 --> 00:51:33.314
And the importance of a teacher
is ever going to go away.

00:51:33.314 --> 00:51:35.480
And so all the different
ways that teachers interact

00:51:35.480 --> 00:51:37.080
with students--
there's still going

00:51:37.080 --> 00:51:38.990
to be some magic number
between one teacher

00:51:38.990 --> 00:51:41.300
and a handful, up
to 20 some students,

00:51:41.300 --> 00:51:43.520
at a time that's going
to really matter.

00:51:43.520 --> 00:51:46.680
So I think a lot of the
original occupations

00:51:46.680 --> 00:51:49.910
but in this very
digitized mode, where

00:51:49.910 --> 00:51:55.190
you can have a whole career
with a fairly niche audience,

00:51:55.190 --> 00:51:57.810
is really interesting
and allows you to still

00:51:57.810 --> 00:52:00.110
have your kids pursue
whatever they're actually

00:52:00.110 --> 00:52:02.490
really passionate about.

00:52:02.490 --> 00:52:04.820
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:52:04.820 --> 00:52:07.370
GUY KAWASAKI: So my
theory is more along

00:52:07.370 --> 00:52:11.680
the law of big
numbers, where I think

00:52:11.680 --> 00:52:16.220
I'd like to expose my children
to as much as possible.

00:52:16.220 --> 00:52:19.660
I kind of find it
reprehensible-- two of my older

00:52:19.660 --> 00:52:24.640
boys in college-- that they're
almost forced to declare majors

00:52:24.640 --> 00:52:26.810
practically in their
senior year of high school.

00:52:26.810 --> 00:52:29.400
And I guess if you're going to
be a doctor, I understand that.

00:52:29.400 --> 00:52:33.367
But anything else,
I just-- I look back

00:52:33.367 --> 00:52:35.200
at what I was in senior
year in high school.

00:52:35.200 --> 00:52:40.580
To think that I would have
determined my career based

00:52:40.580 --> 00:52:43.530
on the next four years,
other than a doctor,

00:52:43.530 --> 00:52:45.875
is just incomprehensible to me.

00:52:45.875 --> 00:52:50.610
And so arguably, they
have even broader choices.

00:52:50.610 --> 00:52:55.130
So I'm really not
pushing them in any way.

00:52:55.130 --> 00:52:58.040
I think they need a good
basic liberal arts college

00:52:58.040 --> 00:53:01.700
education, contrary to some
of the people you work with.

00:53:01.700 --> 00:53:05.580
And I just hope that in
the law of big numbers,

00:53:05.580 --> 00:53:07.080
they get exposed
to a lot of things,

00:53:07.080 --> 00:53:10.532
because if you told me my
senior year of high school

00:53:10.532 --> 00:53:12.490
that someday I would be
a writer with 13 books,

00:53:12.490 --> 00:53:15.370
I would have told
you you were insane.

00:53:15.370 --> 00:53:17.220
You've got the wrong kid.

00:53:17.220 --> 00:53:18.509
So how do I know?

00:53:18.509 --> 00:53:20.300
And I just hope, by
the law of big numbers,

00:53:20.300 --> 00:53:23.490
they find something that just
makes them so passionate.

00:53:23.490 --> 00:53:30.300
And this may be a reaction to
every Asian gene I have in me,

00:53:30.300 --> 00:53:36.710
because-- so when I went to
college in the '70s-- 1970,

00:53:36.710 --> 00:53:37.315
not 1870--

00:53:37.315 --> 00:53:39.604
[LAUGHTER]

00:53:39.604 --> 00:53:41.020
When I was in
college in the '70s,

00:53:41.020 --> 00:53:45.350
if you were Asian American,
perhaps like you, as you said,

00:53:45.350 --> 00:53:48.090
your parents wanted you to be a
doctor, a lawyer, or a dentist.

00:53:48.090 --> 00:53:49.580
And I didn't want
to stick my hand

00:53:49.580 --> 00:53:52.500
in any part of any
body, mouth or body.

00:53:52.500 --> 00:53:54.660
So there goes
doctor and dentist.

00:53:54.660 --> 00:53:56.670
So all that was left was law.

00:53:56.670 --> 00:53:59.320
So went to law school
for literally two weeks.

00:53:59.320 --> 00:54:01.620
And I just hated
law school so much.

00:54:01.620 --> 00:54:03.580
I dropped out of law
school in two weeks.

00:54:03.580 --> 00:54:06.370
And so that was a very traumatic
thing-- Asian American,

00:54:06.370 --> 00:54:08.610
2,000 generations
of my family worked

00:54:08.610 --> 00:54:11.620
to get me to this law school,
and I quit after two weeks.

00:54:11.620 --> 00:54:15.250
The only thing left was
suicide at this point.

00:54:15.250 --> 00:54:18.980
But I look back, and I think
that was the first time

00:54:18.980 --> 00:54:21.660
that my intelligence
showed through,

00:54:21.660 --> 00:54:24.086
because many people
practice law for 20 years

00:54:24.086 --> 00:54:25.460
and figure out
they're miserable.

00:54:25.460 --> 00:54:28.500
I did that in two weeks.

00:54:28.500 --> 00:54:31.550
So you just never know.

00:54:31.550 --> 00:54:38.030
And it's inconceivable
to me for anyone

00:54:38.030 --> 00:54:40.860
to sit here and say I can
tell you what your kids should

00:54:40.860 --> 00:54:44.670
be 10 years, because if
we're so smart, how come we

00:54:44.670 --> 00:54:47.520
all thought Myspace
would control the world?

00:54:47.520 --> 00:54:48.530
Oops.

00:54:48.530 --> 00:54:50.170
Right?

00:54:50.170 --> 00:54:55.580
So just give them a good, broad
education, let them have at it.

00:54:55.580 --> 00:54:57.829
That's my theory.

00:54:57.829 --> 00:54:59.620
JENNY ALDEN: I will
say, I don't have kids,

00:54:59.620 --> 00:55:01.170
but I was a kid, am a kid.

00:55:01.170 --> 00:55:03.420
I have an incredible
mom over there.

00:55:03.420 --> 00:55:06.630
And my parents just were
always, we love you,

00:55:06.630 --> 00:55:08.580
and we don't care
as long as you try.

00:55:08.580 --> 00:55:10.770
I had this unconditional love.

00:55:10.770 --> 00:55:13.060
And I notice with my friends
who had the parents who

00:55:13.060 --> 00:55:16.360
would frame their straight A's
and expect them to get Harvard

00:55:16.360 --> 00:55:18.200
and all that-- they
were so much more

00:55:18.200 --> 00:55:20.320
stressed and
fear-driven in life.

00:55:20.320 --> 00:55:22.320
And the reason why I
got my wonderful job

00:55:22.320 --> 00:55:25.950
and I work with Keith is the man
who hired me, he said, Jenny,

00:55:25.950 --> 00:55:29.800
I recognize that you're
joy-driven, not fear-driven.

00:55:29.800 --> 00:55:32.900
And that's how I got to be
in the incredible position

00:55:32.900 --> 00:55:33.580
that I'm in.

00:55:33.580 --> 00:55:37.120
And that was from just
the love from my parents

00:55:37.120 --> 00:55:39.414
and saying, as long as you try.

00:55:39.414 --> 00:55:41.080
AUDIENCE: Can you
teach super achieving?

00:55:41.080 --> 00:55:44.916
Are you just talking
to the winners?

00:55:44.916 --> 00:55:48.210
There are lots of people
who did all those things

00:55:48.210 --> 00:55:50.927
and are unhappy and
left on the curve,

00:55:50.927 --> 00:55:52.510
and these are just
people who happened

00:55:52.510 --> 00:55:55.330
to pick the right company
or whatever to go to.

00:55:55.330 --> 00:55:58.910
MOLLY LAVIK: I believe with
every fiber of my being

00:55:58.910 --> 00:56:03.930
that you can absolutely teach
anyone to super achieve.

00:56:03.930 --> 00:56:06.790
And here's why.

00:56:06.790 --> 00:56:10.580
The people that-- and I've
now had an opportunity

00:56:10.580 --> 00:56:13.480
to talk to thousands of
people that have done this.

00:56:13.480 --> 00:56:15.120
And they are some
of the people who

00:56:15.120 --> 00:56:19.830
have had the worst that life
has to give them-- that they've

00:56:19.830 --> 00:56:22.840
conquered-- people that
didn't even go to school,

00:56:22.840 --> 00:56:28.240
not even grammar school, people
that had no money, people that

00:56:28.240 --> 00:56:31.700
were imprisoned, and yet,
they turned their life around.

00:56:31.700 --> 00:56:34.670
So it's not easy.

00:56:34.670 --> 00:56:37.490
And sometimes, the
other thing-- I

00:56:37.490 --> 00:56:39.310
have one more thing to tell you.

00:56:39.310 --> 00:56:41.990
And it is you can be so close.

00:56:41.990 --> 00:56:47.830
And I recently read a book
about this, about being so close

00:56:47.830 --> 00:56:50.910
and giving up, and just
how close each of you

00:56:50.910 --> 00:56:53.830
could be to your own
super achievement.

00:56:53.830 --> 00:56:57.730
And it's the book
"Good to Great"

00:56:57.730 --> 00:57:00.580
by Napoleon Hill, his book.

00:57:00.580 --> 00:57:03.660
And anyhow, he was
saying he had interviewed

00:57:03.660 --> 00:57:05.750
someone who was a gold miner.

00:57:05.750 --> 00:57:08.590
And he had been drilling
for gold and he gave up.

00:57:08.590 --> 00:57:10.920
He tried and he soul
all his equipment.

00:57:10.920 --> 00:57:13.300
Three weeks later, someone
bought the equipment

00:57:13.300 --> 00:57:15.200
and found the biggest
gold strike ever.

00:57:15.200 --> 00:57:17.950
So it's possible.

00:57:17.950 --> 00:57:18.880
It's not easy.

00:57:18.880 --> 00:57:21.800
There are certain traits
you need to develop.

00:57:21.800 --> 00:57:25.330
And that's what I'm hoping to
do with my mentor insight kit.

00:57:25.330 --> 00:57:26.620
I have found five things.

00:57:26.620 --> 00:57:29.730
You've heard them talk tonight--
our superstar super achievers--

00:57:29.730 --> 00:57:32.560
about stepping out of
your comfort zone, Jenny's

00:57:32.560 --> 00:57:36.210
story of transforming
adversity into opportunity.

00:57:36.210 --> 00:57:39.850
Self exploration
is another big one.

00:57:39.850 --> 00:57:42.910
Something called zigzagging--
you heard Jeff's story.

00:57:42.910 --> 00:57:46.210
He was at Google, then he went
Boulder, Colorado, and then

00:57:46.210 --> 00:57:47.010
over here.

00:57:47.010 --> 00:57:50.930
And now, he's back at the
world renowned Brand Lab.

00:57:50.930 --> 00:57:56.660
And of course, Guy--
full throttle focus.

00:57:56.660 --> 00:58:00.910
When he's working on a
book, there's nothing.

00:58:00.910 --> 00:58:03.690
An atomic bomb could
go off, and that is not

00:58:03.690 --> 00:58:06.830
going to derail Guy
Kawasaki, right?

00:58:06.830 --> 00:58:07.670
It's nothing.

00:58:07.670 --> 00:58:09.780
I'm sure he encounters
all kinds of challenges.

00:58:09.780 --> 00:58:13.690
So yes, I do believe
it's possible.

00:58:13.690 --> 00:58:14.890
So thank you.

00:58:14.890 --> 00:58:17.530
And if anybody needs help
getting started on your way,

00:58:17.530 --> 00:58:19.900
or perhaps many of
you are on your way--

00:58:19.900 --> 00:58:22.310
if you have a major goal,
please don't give up on it.

00:58:22.310 --> 00:58:25.960
And these four
people are examples.

00:58:25.960 --> 00:58:30.130
And Keith Powers with
his brilliant strategy--
