TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hi there.

00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:04.050
I'm Timothy Jordan, a Developer
Advocate here at Google.

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:07.330
And as you probably know, I like
to do videos for developers,

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:10.120
helping to educate and
inspire around our platforms

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:10.980
and services.

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.670
And I'm here with
Marques Brownlee.

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:13.180
MARQUES BROWNLEE: That's funny.

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:15.690
I also make videos, so I think
it would makes sense for us

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.101
to make a video
at the same time.

00:00:17.101 --> 00:00:18.600
TIMOTHY JORDAN: I
don't see why not.

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.975
And in fact, let's start out
in one of my favorite areas,

00:00:20.975 --> 00:00:21.600
Android Wear.

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:27.446
So here we are in the
Android Wear area--

00:00:27.446 --> 00:00:29.570
really big watches, which
is, I think, pretty cool,

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:31.960
and, of course, a normal
size watch on my wrist.

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:33.810
Now, I want to show
you one of the new apps

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:37.910
that we launched recently, which
is Google Maps on Android Wear.

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:41.140
If I just tap on the
watch, load up Google Maps,

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:42.730
you can see, well,
the first thing

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:45.640
is that it's Maps on the
watch, which is pretty cool.

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.530
But also, I can set it
up so that the compass is

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:49.420
following me.

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:51.060
As I kind of turn
my wrist around,

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:53.970
or I look different directions,
the map goes with me.

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:54.916
Also I can zoom out.

00:00:54.916 --> 00:00:55.640
I can zoom in.

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.180
I can look at local places.

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.030
And this is a key thing-- if
it goes into ambient mode,

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:02.740
the map is still
there on the watch.

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:04.180
And it's going to update
once every minute.

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.721
So all I need to do is glance
at my watch, whatever mode it's

00:01:06.721 --> 00:01:08.060
in, and I know where I'm at.

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.440
MARQUES BROWNLEE: Very nice.

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:09.850
And I'll tell you
what, that compass mode

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:11.520
is going to be really handy
for me, because I have

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:12.805
a terrible sense of direction.

00:01:12.805 --> 00:01:13.950
TIMOTHY JORDAN: It happens.

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.460
Oh, there's Clem.

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:18.050
Hey, Clem-- hey, how's it going?

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:19.430
This is Clem Wright.

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:21.670
He is a Product Manager
on Android Wear,

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:23.060
and this is Marques.

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:24.500
He is awesome.

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:24.950
MARQUES BROWNLEE:
All right, so I've

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:26.140
heard a little bit
about an app called

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:27.520
VimoGolf on Android Wear.

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.210
I was hoping maybe you
could show me how it works.

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:30.630
CLEM WRIGHT: Yeah,
sure, so this uses

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.520
the accelerometer and
gyroscope in the watch

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:33.910
to track your golf swing.

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:35.370
So go ahead and set up.

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:36.820
Get your stance right.

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:38.070
TIMOTHY JORDAN: This is great.

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.350
We know, Marques, that you're
a little out of practice,

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.808
so don't worry
about being perfect.

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:46.410
CLEM WRIGHT: Awesome,
yeah, so, as you see,

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:49.087
we can watch your swing
played back here on the phone.

00:01:49.087 --> 00:01:50.420
TIMOTHY JORDAN: That is so cool.

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.920
You know, you're still
in the swing of things.

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.622
MARQUES BROWNLEE: I
told you I still had it.

00:01:55.622 --> 00:01:58.080
TIMOTHY JORDAN: OK, so here we
are in the Google Cast area.

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:59.913
And now, you know Google
Cast is a great way

00:01:59.913 --> 00:02:02.770
to control your media, such
as your TV shows or your music

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:03.590
from your phone.

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:05.710
Well, now it's also a
great way to play games.

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:09.990
And Marques is actually playing
Driver Speedboat Paradise,

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:14.540
and he's about to beat my time.

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.970
Hey, Nathan, could you-- you
really need to meet Nathan.

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:22.940
He's right here and--
oh, you-- that's too bad.

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:26.034
So Nathan here is a Product
Manager on Google Cast.

00:02:26.034 --> 00:02:27.450
Nathan, could you
tell us a little

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.970
why this game looks so great
on the television right now?

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.470
NATHAN CAMARILLO: Yeah, Google
Cast Remote Display for games

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:35.360
allows game developers to
harness all the great GPUs that

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.529
are in a phone and render
great looking content

00:02:37.529 --> 00:02:40.070
not only to the local device,
but directly to the television.

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:41.560
It's available for
developers now,

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:42.890
and it's really easy to use.

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:43.890
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Awesome.

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:45.660
Well, we should
back to this game.

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:46.980
Is it my turn yet?

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.520
MARQUES BROWNLEE: I was just
about to beat the record, too.

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:50.340
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Oh,
that's right, OK.

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.140
Go for it again.

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:55.040
So here we are in
the Android TV area,

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.554
and we're all playing on the
NVIDIA Shield Android TV.

00:02:57.554 --> 00:02:58.970
And of course,
it's a racing game,

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:00.820
so Marques is kicking our butts.

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:01.790
MARQUES BROWNLEE: Yeah,
it's a racing game.

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:03.216
I've got to be on
top of my game.

00:03:03.216 --> 00:03:05.340
But I'm curious, since this
is a new NVIDIA Shield,

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.381
if we crack this thing
open-- not that we would--

00:03:07.381 --> 00:03:08.472
what would we find inside?

00:03:08.472 --> 00:03:09.430
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Krispy?

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:10.888
KRISTAN KRISPY
UCCELLO: Well, you'd

00:03:10.888 --> 00:03:13.070
find some very excellent
NVIDIA engineering.

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:16.130
They've brought their X1
processor to Android TV

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:17.676
and packaged it up
in a form factor

00:03:17.676 --> 00:03:19.050
that consumers
are going to love.

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:20.680
It plays everything
from AAA titles

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.380
all the way down
to casual games.

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:25.540
And as the Play Store expands,
the number of games available,

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.584
consumers are just going
to love this thing.

00:03:27.584 --> 00:03:29.000
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
Awesome, well, I'm

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.249
going to get back in the game.

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:35.090
[CHEERING]

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.634
All right, Marques, here we
are in the Android Auto area,

00:03:38.634 --> 00:03:41.050
and I promise you we're going
to get in one of these cars,

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:42.400
so you can text your mom.

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:43.940
MARQUES BROWNLEE: That's
exactly what I need right now.

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:45.310
TIMOTHY JORDAN: So it's
looking pretty busy.

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:46.770
But I know these
guys really well,

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:48.100
so it shouldn't be a problem.

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:50.313
MARQUES BROWNLEE: Let's do it.

00:03:50.313 --> 00:03:51.396
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hey, Andy.

00:03:51.396 --> 00:03:52.250
ANDREW BRENNER: Hey, Timothy.

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:53.560
TIMOTHY JORDAN: The car's
looking pretty good.

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:54.060
ANDREW BRENNER: Thanks.

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.100
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hey, so I've
got my buddy Marques here,

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:58.060
and I just wanted to
give him a quick demo.

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:00.518
ANDREW BRENNER: Timothy, you
know the last time we gave you

00:04:00.518 --> 00:04:01.615
a car what happened.

00:04:01.615 --> 00:04:03.365
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Woo,
hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hooo.

00:04:05.856 --> 00:04:07.480
ANDREW BRENNER: You
can borrow the car.

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.789
But it has to stay here.

00:04:09.789 --> 00:04:10.580
TIMOTHY JORDAN: OK.

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:12.460
ANDREW BRENNER: All
right, here you go.

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:13.810
Remember what I said.

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:14.768
TIMOTHY JORDAN: I will.

00:04:14.768 --> 00:04:15.784
Thanks, Andy.

00:04:15.784 --> 00:04:17.200
So here we are at
the home screen.

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:18.516
You can see we get Nav.

00:04:18.516 --> 00:04:19.640
We can head to the airport.

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:21.839
We've got weather, recent calls.

00:04:21.839 --> 00:04:24.570
MARQUES BROWNLEE: It looks like
I also have a text from my mom?

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:25.970
CAR: Here's the message.

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:28.149
How's the conference?

00:04:28.149 --> 00:04:30.190
MARQUES BROWNLEE: Reply--
it's going pretty well,

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:31.273
but I'm a little bit busy.

00:04:31.273 --> 00:04:33.560
I'm driving Android Auto Car.

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:36.025
CAR: Here's the message--
well, that is so cool.

00:04:36.025 --> 00:04:38.150
TIMOTHY JORDAN: For more
information about anything

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:40.750
