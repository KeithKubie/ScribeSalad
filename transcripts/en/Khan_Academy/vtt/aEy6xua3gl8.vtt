00:00:00.256 --> 00:00:01.089
- [Voiceover] Hi Kim!

00:00:01.089 --> 00:00:02.937
- [Voiceover] Hey Becca, so
what are talking about today?

00:00:02.937 --> 00:00:04.655
- [Voiceover] Today we're
gonna be talking about how

00:00:04.655 --> 00:00:08.503
a racial hierarchy was
established in the early Americas,

00:00:08.503 --> 00:00:13.393
about the encomienda system,
the early Atlantic slave trade,

00:00:13.393 --> 00:00:16.863
and how such an arbitrary
factor as race became a way

00:00:16.863 --> 00:00:18.797
that our society was organized,

00:00:18.797 --> 00:00:21.398
and we still feel the
effects of that today.

00:00:21.398 --> 00:00:22.925
- [Voiceover] Okay, interesting.

00:00:22.925 --> 00:00:24.827
- [Voiceover] So to begin we'll talk about

00:00:24.827 --> 00:00:26.809
the encomienda system.

00:00:26.809 --> 00:00:30.962
So the encomienda system was
this dependency relation system

00:00:30.962 --> 00:00:34.310
that started in Spain and
was brought to the Americas

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:36.260
to control the labor system.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.427
Encomienda, that actually
means entrust in Spanish,

00:00:42.894 --> 00:00:46.437
Spaniards that were entrusted
with dividing up the labor

00:00:46.437 --> 00:00:49.647
within the Native American populations.

00:00:49.647 --> 00:00:52.007
So different encomenderos,

00:00:52.007 --> 00:00:54.982
those were Spanish men that
were sent to the colonies,

00:00:54.982 --> 00:00:58.663
were entrusted with dividing
up the labor between

00:00:58.663 --> 00:01:01.027
different Native American groups.

00:01:01.027 --> 00:01:03.441
- [Voiceover] Okay, so this
to me, it sounds a little bit

00:01:03.441 --> 00:01:06.577
like a feudal system,
am I getting this right?

00:01:06.577 --> 00:01:07.943
- [Voiceover] Yeah, definitely!

00:01:07.943 --> 00:01:10.713
- [Voiceover] So the feudal
system was this earlier

00:01:10.713 --> 00:01:14.713
European Medieval system
where there'd be a lord

00:01:16.103 --> 00:01:20.270
who would have the responsibility
of protecting serfs

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:24.191
and in response he'd get their labor

00:01:24.191 --> 00:01:25.841
and a part of their wealth.

00:01:25.841 --> 00:01:28.108
- [Voiceover] So this sounds
a lot like the encomenderos

00:01:28.108 --> 00:01:30.811
and the Native Americans that
were in his jurisdiction.

00:01:30.811 --> 00:01:31.948
- [Voiceover] Okay.

00:01:31.948 --> 00:01:34.971
- [Voiceover] So the
encomenderos would offer

00:01:34.971 --> 00:01:39.390
the Native Americans in
their colony protection

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.631
and they would also
offer them Catholicism.

00:01:42.631 --> 00:01:44.800
They were under this kind of god, gold,

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:46.755
and glory motivation.

00:01:46.755 --> 00:01:48.660
- [Voiceover] I think
I've heard of that before.

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:50.805
- [Voiceover] (chuckling)
Yeah, so god, gold, and glory

00:01:50.805 --> 00:01:52.821
were some of the reasons
that colonists wanted to come

00:01:52.821 --> 00:01:56.160
to the New World, and they
really wanted to inspire

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:59.508
and promote Catholicism abroad.

00:01:59.508 --> 00:02:01.105
And they really wanted
to increase the practice

00:02:01.105 --> 00:02:02.881
amongst the native people.

00:02:02.881 --> 00:02:05.587
- [Voiceover] Yeah, I think
one of the things that we

00:02:05.587 --> 00:02:09.511
have to understand about this
time period is how religiously

00:02:09.511 --> 00:02:11.389
motivated many people were.

00:02:11.389 --> 00:02:14.176
I mean when it comes down
to it, gold is gonna be more

00:02:14.176 --> 00:02:18.775
of a motivator than religion
but they saw their role

00:02:18.775 --> 00:02:21.375
as Christians, as Catholics,

00:02:21.375 --> 00:02:24.321
as trying to convert the entire world.

00:02:24.321 --> 00:02:27.344
- [Voiceover] Right, and
in return the encomenderos

00:02:27.344 --> 00:02:31.261
expected from the native
people a lot of labor.

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.470
So the natives had a
much better understanding

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:39.703
of the land itself that they
were aiming to cultivate.

00:02:39.703 --> 00:02:42.872
At the time period in
the 1500s, the Spaniards,

00:02:42.872 --> 00:02:45.188
the Portuguese, the Dutch, the English,

00:02:45.188 --> 00:02:49.324
everyone's coming over and
wanting to create new markets,

00:02:49.324 --> 00:02:51.827
especially with tobacco, sugar,

00:02:51.827 --> 00:02:55.419
and the Native Americans
under the encomienda system

00:02:55.419 --> 00:02:58.807
were expected to help
the encomenderos produce

00:02:58.807 --> 00:03:01.627
at a really high rate in
which they they could send

00:03:01.627 --> 00:03:03.512
these goods back to Europe.

00:03:03.512 --> 00:03:06.068
- [Voiceover] I think it's
worthwhile to note here

00:03:06.068 --> 00:03:08.542
that we're saying, oh
they wanted the labor

00:03:08.542 --> 00:03:09.786
of the Native Americans.

00:03:09.786 --> 00:03:13.093
Well why didn't the Spanish
just send their own people

00:03:13.093 --> 00:03:17.798
to process sugar, to grow
tobacco up in the New World?

00:03:17.798 --> 00:03:19.894
And there are a couple
of reasons for that.

00:03:19.894 --> 00:03:23.673
One is that they kind of
knew that the New World

00:03:23.673 --> 00:03:25.688
was more or less a death trap.

00:03:25.688 --> 00:03:28.622
(laughter)

00:03:28.622 --> 00:03:31.190
It wouldn't be until the mid-1600s

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:35.643
that a lot of these
places had a survival rate

00:03:35.643 --> 00:03:37.976
for settlers above 50%.

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:42.940
So a lot of whites in
Europe wanted to avoid that.

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:46.304
They also didn't really
see these plantations

00:03:46.304 --> 00:03:49.059
as being something they
needed to work directly.

00:03:49.059 --> 00:03:52.715
They kind of thought, I would
rather stay in the courts

00:03:52.715 --> 00:03:55.852
of Europe, I would rather be a lord.

00:03:55.852 --> 00:03:59.314
You know, many in England,
later they'll be many members

00:03:59.314 --> 00:04:03.328
of Parliament who own
plantations in the West Indies

00:04:03.328 --> 00:04:05.904
and they've never even
been to those plantations

00:04:05.904 --> 00:04:07.123
but they're sure profiting.

00:04:07.123 --> 00:04:08.683
- [Voiceover] Yeah, I think
that's definitely right.

00:04:08.683 --> 00:04:11.901
And when the encomienda system
was more officially instated

00:04:11.901 --> 00:04:14.891
with Nicolas de Ovando in 1502,

00:04:14.891 --> 00:04:17.743
that was the first
official encomienda system

00:04:17.743 --> 00:04:19.694
in the West Indies.

00:04:19.694 --> 00:04:23.204
He actually took over
after Columbus was ousted

00:04:23.204 --> 00:04:25.704
from his role in San Salvador.

00:04:26.934 --> 00:04:28.689
- [Voiceover] Why was Columbus ousted?

00:04:28.689 --> 00:04:30.241
- [Voiceover] He was a really bad leader.

00:04:30.241 --> 00:04:33.240
Ovando really took over
the encomienda system

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.206
and then it started to
look a lot more like

00:04:35.206 --> 00:04:36.896
what we would call slavery.

00:04:36.896 --> 00:04:40.196
So slowly the encomenderos
would no longer offer

00:04:40.196 --> 00:04:41.991
the Native Americans protection,

00:04:41.991 --> 00:04:44.389
but instead threatened
them if they did not

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:45.933
reach their quota.

00:04:45.933 --> 00:04:48.549
- [Voiceover] Okay, so
instead of protection

00:04:48.549 --> 00:04:49.719
they get threats.

00:04:49.719 --> 00:04:52.295
- [Voiceover] And oftentimes
that turned into extreme

00:04:52.295 --> 00:04:54.562
punishment or death, and
they were forced to do

00:04:54.562 --> 00:04:55.854
extremely hard labor.

00:04:55.854 --> 00:04:59.787
So sowing a sugar
plantation is not easy work

00:04:59.787 --> 00:05:02.696
and so they expected extreme amounts

00:05:02.696 --> 00:05:05.272
of hard labor in the hot sun.

00:05:05.272 --> 00:05:09.477
- [Voiceover] Yeah, processing
sugar is like a 24 hour a day

00:05:09.477 --> 00:05:13.477
kind of deal and it is I
think perhaps the worst

00:05:14.357 --> 00:05:16.380
kind of labor you could do.

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:18.249
- [Voiceover] And they
weren't just trying to promote

00:05:18.249 --> 00:05:20.898
Catholicism but also
stripping Native Americans

00:05:20.898 --> 00:05:24.547
of their culture and of
their religious practices.

00:05:24.547 --> 00:05:26.586
- [Voiceover] So Catholicism,
not optional. (chuckling)

00:05:26.586 --> 00:05:28.236
- [Voiceover] Catholicism was not,

00:05:28.236 --> 00:05:29.682
not something they were offering,

00:05:29.682 --> 00:05:33.160
it was something they were
instituting with force.

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:37.573
So as more conquistadores
come over to the West Indies,

00:05:37.573 --> 00:05:39.953
some notice this does look like slavery,

00:05:39.953 --> 00:05:41.871
and we are not treating
the Native American people

00:05:41.871 --> 00:05:45.204
with dignity or really as humans at all.

00:05:46.739 --> 00:05:50.395
Bartolome de las Casas was an encomendero

00:05:50.395 --> 00:05:54.458
but in kind of the mid-1500s
he came over to actually

00:05:54.458 --> 00:05:57.132
see his encomiendas in practice,

00:05:57.132 --> 00:06:00.455
and realized the inhumane
treatment and abuse

00:06:00.455 --> 00:06:03.194
the encomienda system promoted.

00:06:03.194 --> 00:06:05.810
He released his encomienda
and started to dedicate

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:08.931
his life to petitioning and
lobbying the King of Spain,

00:06:08.931 --> 00:06:12.596
Charles V, to institute
new laws that would protect

00:06:12.596 --> 00:06:15.830
Native Americans against
these abusive practices.

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:17.934
- [Voiceover] Yeah, you know
when you're looking around

00:06:17.934 --> 00:06:22.615
this time period for a
good person in this system,

00:06:22.615 --> 00:06:27.320
Bartolome de las Casas is
pretty much the only one.

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:28.823
- [Voiceover] Yeah, he was
a good dude amongst a lot

00:06:28.823 --> 00:06:30.619
of not so good dudes.

00:06:30.619 --> 00:06:31.781
(laughter)

00:06:31.781 --> 00:06:35.511
And so in 1542 new laws,
they were literally called

00:06:35.511 --> 00:06:39.338
the New Laws, were passed by Charles V.

00:06:39.338 --> 00:06:41.817
And these laws didn't outlaw
the encomienda system,

00:06:41.817 --> 00:06:43.336
but aimed to put some regulation

00:06:43.336 --> 00:06:45.896
on these inhumane practices.

00:06:45.896 --> 00:06:47.765
The encomienda system wouldn't be

00:06:47.765 --> 00:06:50.016
outlawed completely until 1720.

00:06:50.016 --> 00:06:51.072
- [Voiceover] Oh, wow.

00:06:51.072 --> 00:06:53.575
- [Voiceover] So the effects
of the encomienda system

00:06:53.575 --> 00:06:55.972
were already really
being felt at this time

00:06:55.972 --> 00:06:59.263
and contributed to the
formation of this arbitrary

00:06:59.263 --> 00:07:01.998
racial hierarchy that we
will continue to talk about

00:07:01.998 --> 00:07:02.831
in the next video.
