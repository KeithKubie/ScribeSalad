00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.970
In the last unit, we have talked about what you can do when a problem is NP-complete,

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:07.140
despite it being NP-complete.

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.700
And we have found out that there are techniques such as optimized search trees,

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:13.750
preprocessing, and fixed parameter tractability

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:17.690
that you can often use to solve NP-complete problems and practice

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:19.690
despite their hardness in general.

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:21.830
So what can we do when these techiniques don't work,

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:25.520
and we don't want to prove that P=NP?

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.520
Well, in that case, we can try something else.

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:29.910
We can try to give our algorithm a little leeway.

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.340
So instead of demanding that the algorithm finds the best possible solution,

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:39.800
we'll allow the algorithm to find a solution that is within a certain range of the best possible solution.

00:00:39.800 --> 99:59:59.000
In return, of course, we'll demand from our algorithm that it runs in polynomial time.
