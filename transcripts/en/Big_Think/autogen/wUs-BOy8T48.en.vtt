able to implement this so those are some
 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.630
able to implement this so those are some

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640
of the reasons to uplift society and to
 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.089
of the reasons to uplift society and to

we are as humans exploring species you

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100
we are as humans exploring species you
 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.160
we are as humans exploring species you
know we began the plains of Africa and

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170
know we began the plains of Africa and
 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.130
know we began the plains of Africa and
our need to explore that took us into

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140
our need to explore that took us into
 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.220
our need to explore that took us into
Europe into Asia across the Straits into

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230
Europe into Asia across the Straits into
 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.610
Europe into Asia across the Straits into
the Americas and so forth that drive to

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620
the Americas and so forth that drive to
 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.220
the Americas and so forth that drive to
explore is resident in our DNA in fact

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230
explore is resident in our DNA in fact
 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.680
explore is resident in our DNA in fact
it's genetically if you would selected

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690
it's genetically if you would selected
 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.230
it's genetically if you would selected
for because those who explore and move

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:36.240
for because those who explore and move
 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:39.230
for because those who explore and move
out the widest and furthest have the

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:39.240
out the widest and furthest have the
 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:42.110
out the widest and furthest have the
least chance of having their genome you

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120
least chance of having their genome you

know destroyed by a local accident and
so that is a evolutionary imperative

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750
so that is a evolutionary imperative
 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.810
so that is a evolutionary imperative
we're not going to stop here on planet

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:50.820
we're not going to stop here on planet
 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:53.150
we're not going to stop here on planet
earth we're going to move out to other

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160
earth we're going to move out to other
 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.570
earth we're going to move out to other
planetary bodies and not I believe not

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580
planetary bodies and not I believe not
 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:58.610

going into the planetary you know

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620
going into the planetary you know

going into the planetary you know
gravitational wells will build societies

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:00.990
gravitational wells will build societies

gravitational wells will build societies
and in you know O'Neill like spheres and

and in you know O'Neill like spheres and
 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:05.900
and in you know O'Neill like spheres and
and humanity will move out into the

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910
and humanity will move out into the
 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:08.780
and humanity will move out into the
cosmos and probably meet other societies

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790
cosmos and probably meet other societies

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:15.860
 
something very interesting has happened

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870
something very interesting has happened
 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:17.179
something very interesting has happened
over the last hundred years that people

00:03:17.179 --> 00:03:17.189
over the last hundred years that people
 

00:03:17.189 --> 00:03:19.580
over the last hundred years that people
don't think about which is that the

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590
don't think about which is that the
 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.339
don't think about which is that the
frontiers that we have have started to

00:03:22.339 --> 00:03:22.349
frontiers that we have have started to
 

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:24.559
frontiers that we have have started to
shrink and disappear it used to be that

00:03:24.559 --> 00:03:24.569
shrink and disappear it used to be that
 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:28.929

100 or 150 years ago if you screwed up

00:03:28.929 --> 00:03:28.939
100 or 150 years ago if you screwed up
 

00:03:28.939 --> 00:03:31.849
100 or 150 years ago if you screwed up
you know you up literally in one

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:31.859
you know you up literally in one
 

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:35.899
you know you up literally in one
area you're you could go and start again

00:03:35.899 --> 00:03:35.909
area you're you could go and start again
 

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:39.920

someplace you you could go and and start

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930
someplace you you could go and and start
 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:43.069
someplace you you could go and and start
your life again without the stigma of

your life again without the stigma of
 

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:45.890
your life again without the stigma of
what happened there's no place you can

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900
what happened there's no place you can
 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.679
what happened there's no place you can
do that again there's no real frontiers

00:03:48.679 --> 00:03:48.689
do that again there's no real frontiers
 

00:03:48.689 --> 00:03:51.559
do that again there's no real frontiers
so that ability the second thing about

00:03:51.559 --> 00:03:51.569
so that ability the second thing about
 

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:54.530
so that ability the second thing about
frontiers are it allows the individuals

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540
frontiers are it allows the individuals
 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.750
frontiers are it allows the individuals
who are best whether they're men or
