&gt;&gt;Hi, my name is Bjarte Reve and I'm the CEO
of the Oslo Cancer Cluster

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:07.250
in Norway.
One of the questions we got is do you think

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:10.179
health care should be a
state-sponsored service available to anyone

00:00:10.179 --> 00:00:12.959
who needs it?
My answer is definitely yes.

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:17.800
If you see health care as the basis for development
in each country,

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:22.160
and if you don't have health care, and also
good education, you can't

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.039
really make countries and peoples develop.
So definitely yes.
