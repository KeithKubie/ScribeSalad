00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:01.940
Now we are at the point in which we

00:00:01.940 --> 00:00:05.590
have collected and modeled our requirements. So the next thing

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:08.310
that we can do is to analyze the requirements to

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:11.720
identify possible problems, and specifically there are three types of

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:14.646
analysis that we can perform. The first type of analysis

00:00:14.646 --> 00:00:16.820
is verification. So in this case we're talking about the

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:19.700
requirements verification. And in verification

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:21.990
developers will study the requirements

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.270
to check whether they're correct, whether they accurately reflect the

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:28.710
customer needs as perceived by the developer. Developers can

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.170
also check the completeness of the requirements, check whether there

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:34.510
are any missing pieces in the requirements as we

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:37.710
discussed earlier. They can check whether the requirements are pertinent,

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.260
or contain irrelevant information, like the one shown here.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.670
And they can also check whether they're consistent, unambiguous, testable

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.920
and so on, so all those properties that should

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.380
be satisfied for the requirements. A second type of analysis

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:53.670
that is typically performed on requirements is validation. And

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.290
the goal of validation is to assess whether the collected

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:59.870
requirements define the system that the stakeholders really want.

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.330
So the focus here is on the stakeholders. And in

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:05.670
some cases, stakeholders can check the requirements directly if

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.910
the requirements are expressed in a notation that they understand.

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:11.120
Or they might check them by discussing them with the

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:15.490
developers. Another possibility is that stakeholders asses the requirements by

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:18.400
interacting with a prototype of the system, in case

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.690
the requirements engineering process that is being used involves

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:25.300
early prototyping. And finally surveys, testing, and other techniques

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:28.400
can also be used to validate requirements. A final type

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.780
of analysis that we can perform on requirements is

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.430
risk analysis. And risk analysis aims to identify and

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:37.680
analyze the main risks involved with the development of

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.560
the system being considered. And if some requirements are deemed

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.320
to be too risky, like in this case, this might result in

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.880
changes in the requirements model to eliminate or address those risks. And note

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.950
that all these analysis activities can

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.390
be performed in many different ways depending

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:53.990
on the modeling languages chosen to

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:56.150
represent the requirements and on the context.
