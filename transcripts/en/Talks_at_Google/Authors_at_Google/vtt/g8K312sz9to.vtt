00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:04.230
BOB: Thanks for coming.

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.090
Donald Stoker is professor
of strategy and policy

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:10.140
at the US Naval War
College in Monterey

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:12.240
at the Naval
Postgraduate School.

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.890
He's the author of, or
editor of, seven books,

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:17.750
including a book on the Civil
War, "The Grand Design--

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:21.760
Strategy and the Civil War,"
which won the 2010 Fletcher

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:24.010
Pratt award.

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:27.060
So he's going to tell us about
Clausewitz, which many of you

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:27.870
have heard of.

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:30.675
The most famous
quote is, "War is

00:00:30.675 --> 00:00:34.572
the continuation of
policy by other means."

00:00:34.572 --> 00:00:36.280
But I think he's going
to tell us there's

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.350
more to him than
that, which is good,

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:40.130
because the book is
kind of hard to read.

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:42.560
I've tried reading Clausewitz
and didn't go too far.

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:45.922
So with that, let's
welcome Donald Stoker.

00:00:45.922 --> 00:00:47.380
DONALD STOKER:
Thank you very much.

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:48.052
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:48.052 --> 00:00:49.200
Well, thank you, Bob.

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.730
And I thank Google
for inviting me.

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:54.350
It's a good opportunity for me.

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.390
And to start with my disclaimer,
because I'm a federal employee.

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:00.080
Everything I say is
my opinion and not

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:01.579
that of the United
States government

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:04.530
or any branch or
association thereof.

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.619
So I'm going to talk
to you just a little

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:08.410
bit this morning about
Carl von Clausewitz.

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.820
I teach a class-- a class
called Strategy and War--

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:16.960
and we talk about
Clausewitz the theorist.

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.480
And one of the things I have
to overcome with my students--

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:21.450
some of the students,
the mid-grade officers--

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.850
is there's a reluctance
sometimes to study theory.

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:29.430
And sometimes their reluctance
is with good reason.

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.195
But if they've ever
heard of Clausewitz,

00:01:31.195 --> 00:01:32.570
or if anyone's
ever heard of him,

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:34.980
obviously he's the
author of "On War."

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:38.640
And that's certainly where
he's been most of influential.

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.640
But Clausewitz was
also a soldier,

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.660
and this is sometimes forgotten
in the discussion of his ideas

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:45.770
and end of his life.

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:47.940
And it gives him a little
bit more credibility

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:51.300
to some of my students, who have
often been deployed nine or 10

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:54.500
times to Iraq, Afghanistan,
or sundry other entertaining

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.710
places, when they realize,
yeah, this is a guy,

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:01.600
he's not just a theorist,
some professor like me

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.260
up there just spouting
things to them.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.570
He's a guy who actually
had done something as well.

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:09.134
And to me, you can't
separate his experience

00:02:09.134 --> 00:02:11.850
as a soldier from his
writing as a theorist,

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:14.860
because both things
are so intertwined.

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:18.689
And so Clausewitz,
again, he was a soldier,

00:02:18.689 --> 00:02:20.855
and a soldier with an
enormous amount of experience.

00:02:20.855 --> 00:02:23.960
He was probably
in 36-- either in

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:26.980
or present at least
three dozen battles.

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.720
I think it was more, but
it's difficult to decisively

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.080
determine that from the
source material I could find.

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.220
His father was a soldier.

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.160
He grew up in the
country of Prussia,

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.200
which is the country,
as you guys know,

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.655
eventually unifies Germany.

00:02:42.655 --> 00:02:45.050
And he goes into the
army probably at age 11.

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:47.070
There's some argument
over his birth date.

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:51.030
And this is not actually
unusual for this time period.

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.600
In British Navy famously,
kids went to sea eight, nine,

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:54.850
10 years old.

00:02:54.850 --> 00:03:00.040
So the child soldier has
been with us for a long time.

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.760
It's not just a
scourge we see today.

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.880
And he fights in all
five of these wars here.

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:05.990
And this is essentially
in some ways

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:08.010
an outline for some of the stuff
I'm going to talk about to you.

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.301
Because I'm going to talk
about why these things matter

00:03:10.301 --> 00:03:13.100
for his development and
hopefully why it matters

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:15.770
for what he eventually gives us.

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:19.140
And there are several strong
influences, obviously,

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.610
in his life and influences
in writing as well.

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:26.070
And one of the most important is
the French Revolution in 1789,

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:29.000
when the French revolutionaries
revolt, overthrow the king,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.570
eventually execute him.

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:33.780
And you see a situation
where, because

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.430
of the French
Revolution, you overturn

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:38.940
the political and military
apple carts and social apple

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.060
cart in many ways of Europe--
in a particular way, warfare.

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.490
For our purposes, it was an
important way warfare is done.

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:47.480
Armies go from being small,
fairly small, relatively

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:52.360
professional to having mass
armies fed by conscription

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:54.820
and fed by large
elements of the state.

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:56.990
And you see this
unleashing of the passion

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:58.790
of the citizen, the
passion of the people,

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:01.731
as Clausewitz himself calls
it, to harness to war,

00:04:01.731 --> 00:04:03.730
whereas the people had
been kind of pushed aside

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:05.580
and war was the
realm of the army

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:07.000
and the king and the princes.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.140
It becomes the role
of the people as well.

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:11.920
And from this French
Revolutionary experience

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:14.230
rises up one Clausewitz's
other influences

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:18.050
in many ways, this man here--
Napoleon Bonaparte-- who

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:21.260
becomes, because of his own
skill, the opportunity he has,

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:26.490
and just his brilliant
as well in co-opting

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:28.790
this wonderful French military
machine that develops,

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:31.360
becomes the master of Europe.

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:33.334
And you can see what
Clausewitz says about him.

00:04:33.334 --> 00:04:34.750
Calls him "the god
of war himself,

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:36.958
the most determined general
the world has ever seen."

00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:40.070
He doesn't like
Napoleon's politics,

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:43.290
but he admires, respects
Napoleon's military skill,

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:46.880
and wants to know why is this
guy so good at what he does.

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:52.620
Well, Clausewitz goes off to his
first war in January of 1793.

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:54.710
Remember, he was born in 1780.

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:57.200
And this campaign
is essentially one

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:01.110
of the first revolutionary
wars, where it's essentially

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:03.390
Prussia and Austria
fighting the French,

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:05.140
and there are some
other little countries,

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:06.800
smaller states involved.

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:09.040
And the French revolutionaries
had essentially

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:11.550
ended up eventually at
war with most of Europe,

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:12.990
to boil it down.

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:16.240
But he'll participate in the
siege of this city of Mainz,

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:18.810
and he'll help attack some
of the fortifications here.

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:22.470
Following this will be this
campaign in the [? Voz ?] area.

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:24.110
It was a really rugged campaign.

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:25.610
Clausewitz says it
almost kills him.

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:27.800
He's only 12, 13 years
old when this is going on.

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:30.160
There are two other
officer cadets

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:31.900
in the unit that
are young like him.

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:33.690
They both are killed.

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:37.110
They both die as a result of
the rigors of the campaign.

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:39.600
And he almost dies as
well at a couple places

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:41.830
when the position he's
in one time is overrun.

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:44.430
But what does this tell
us, though, about him?

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:47.440
Well, it's important
for his development.

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:49.370
One, the experience
that he gets from this

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:51.100
always lives with him.

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:54.840
He refers to this later on,
the events that happens here.

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:56.640
But he also,
reflecting on it later,

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:59.170
he talks about just
how confused he was.

00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:01.880
He never really knew what
was just physically going on.

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:04.380
But also intellectually,
he didn't understand,

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:05.130
why are we here?

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:05.880
What are we doing?

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:08.070
What is the point
of all of this?

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:09.850
Why is this war being fought?

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:11.990
And that puzzled
him, and he really

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:14.960
wanted to know and
understand these things.

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:19.909
And after this-- now, he never
had any education growing up,

00:06:19.909 --> 00:06:20.950
or very little education.

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:21.820
Just some of the local school.

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:23.319
When you go into
the army at age 11,

00:06:23.319 --> 00:06:25.450
you haven't had much
time for graduate school.

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:29.759
So he's posted on a village
family and a peasant family

00:06:29.759 --> 00:06:30.550
for a little while.

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:32.962
And here's a library nearby,
and he begins to read.

00:06:32.962 --> 00:06:34.420
And he discovers
the Enlightenment,

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:37.980
discovers education, and
becomes a voracious reader.

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:41.300
He's posted to
another command where

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:44.280
the commander of
the base he's at

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:46.800
is very much interested in
the education of his officers

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:49.570
and his men and even of
the men's families as well.

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:52.350
And he has a garrison
school and so on.

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:54.420
And here he really falls
in love with learning

00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:57.430
and really starts
to blossom here,

00:06:57.430 --> 00:06:59.670
and gets himself an
appointment to one

00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:04.230
of the officer
schools in Berlin.

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:06.410
And this becomes
a pivotal thing,

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:08.210
as far as his development
for his career,

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:11.230
but also in why we get "On War."

00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:14.290
Because here in Berlin, he
graduates first from his class,

00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:16.560
and he ends up with a
mentor named Scharnhorst,

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:19.710
who is this gentleman here--
Gerhard von Scharnhorst who

00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:21.190
runs the school.

00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:23.680
And Clausewitz is
his star pupil.

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:27.670
Scharnhorst, he
teaches Clausewitz

00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:31.620
how to think in many ways,
which is what is critical.

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:34.130
Scharnhorst very much
believed in critical analysis,

00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:36.390
where you look at
something ruthlessly,

00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:37.900
cut away the stuff
that's not true,

00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:40.890
cut away the stuff that
doesn't make sense.

00:07:40.890 --> 00:07:42.720
And when you look
at past events,

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:44.700
you try to get
solid history on it.

00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:46.890
Understand what was
really going on.

00:07:46.890 --> 00:07:51.560
Don't let your own deceptions
and perceptions confuse you.

00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:53.440
Try to get at what is the truth.

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:57.180
And Scharnhorst also gets
him his next job as well as

00:07:57.180 --> 00:07:59.210
an adjutant to one of
the Prussian princes.

00:07:59.210 --> 00:08:01.131
And through that, he
meets this woman here,

00:08:01.131 --> 00:08:03.130
a lady named Marie von
Bruhl who will eventually

00:08:03.130 --> 00:08:05.860
become his wife.

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:08.690
She's a very intelligent,
articulate woman.

00:08:08.690 --> 00:08:09.860
Very well read.

00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:12.150
Very much his
intellectual equal.

00:08:12.150 --> 00:08:15.800
From a much more distinguished
family then Clausewitz.

00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:17.460
Marie's mother--
widowed mother--

00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:20.840
is not so approving
of the relationship.

00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:22.970
It actually takes
them seven years

00:08:22.970 --> 00:08:26.140
to wear Madame von Bruhl
down to where she'll actually

00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:27.641
agree to let them get married.

00:08:27.641 --> 00:08:29.390
Because she's like,
oh, this young officer

00:08:29.390 --> 00:08:32.840
without any land or maybe-- does
he have much career prospects?

00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:35.179
She's kind of skeptical.

00:08:35.179 --> 00:08:38.840
As a father of a daughter,
I kind of understand.

00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:40.610
Who's your daughter
going to marry here?

00:08:40.610 --> 00:08:43.320
But also at the same
time, he begins to write.

00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:44.910
And this is important as well.

00:08:44.910 --> 00:08:49.000
So we're already starting to see
when he's 23, 24 years old what

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.120
we're going to eventually
see partially in "On War."

00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:57.660
Now in 1806, Clausewitz will
march off to his second war.

00:08:57.660 --> 00:08:58.580
Why does this matter?

00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:01.230
Well, Clausewitz has
become very ambitious,

00:09:01.230 --> 00:09:04.440
and he's in a country--
Prussia-- where being a soldier

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:05.460
matters.

00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:06.420
This is important.

00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:07.330
And he is a soldier.

00:09:07.330 --> 00:09:09.015
What matters to be
a successful soldier

00:09:09.015 --> 00:09:12.810
is to prove yourself, to
have success in warfare.

00:09:12.810 --> 00:09:15.990
And in his view, this
is the way that he

00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:17.560
can make it for himself.

00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:20.630
He says something along the
lines of my country needs war

00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:22.340
and I do too.

00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:25.960
So ambition is driving
him here for this.

00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:28.180
What you have happen
in 1806 is essentially

00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:31.760
where Napoleon, who is the
master of most of Europe,

00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:34.180
he invades the
country of Prussia.

00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:37.450
And you end up with this
two-pronged invasion of Prussia

00:09:37.450 --> 00:09:39.960
by the French that is met
by two Prussian armies.

00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:42.400
They will fight two
battles, Jena and Auerstedt.

00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:45.620
The French will decisively
win both of these battles.

00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:48.220
And they will win the
war because of it.

00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:52.660
Now Clausewitz will fight at the
Battle of Auerstedt right here.

00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:55.480
And his unit is the
rear guard, meaning

00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:57.870
the Prussians had essentially
already lost the battle.

00:09:57.870 --> 00:10:00.840
The unit he is in is committed
as part of the rear guard.

00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:03.340
And they fight their way
into this city of Poppel

00:10:03.340 --> 00:10:05.210
and then fight their way out.

00:10:05.210 --> 00:10:08.840
And his boss, Prince August,
is wounded three times-- likely

00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:12.150
wounded three times
in this attack-- which

00:10:12.150 --> 00:10:15.240
was a glimpse of the intensity
of what is going on here.

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:18.130
And then what you
have after this

00:10:18.130 --> 00:10:21.020
is a 14-day fighting retreat
where you can see from the map

00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:21.520
here.

00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:24.720
Roughly, Clausewitz's unit
follows this blue line

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:26.256
essentially, and
eventually they're

00:10:26.256 --> 00:10:29.230
forced to surrender near
the city of Prenzlau

00:10:29.230 --> 00:10:30.630
after a three-hour firefight.

00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:33.560
And Prussia essentially
comes apart during this.

00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:35.830
And Clausewitz is
shipped off to France

00:10:35.830 --> 00:10:38.190
as a prisoner of war
with Prince August.

00:10:38.190 --> 00:10:40.630
And now when Americans,
for most of us today,

00:10:40.630 --> 00:10:42.940
if we think anything
about prisoners of war,

00:10:42.940 --> 00:10:46.499
we think about Andersonville,
or we think about Stalag 17,

00:10:46.499 --> 00:10:48.040
or maybe Stalag 13
if you're watching

00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:49.206
old "Hogan's Heroes" reruns.

00:10:49.206 --> 00:10:51.640
But we don't think
about the experience

00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:54.252
that he has as an officer
and an officer that

00:10:54.252 --> 00:10:56.270
serves an aristocrat.

00:10:56.270 --> 00:10:58.452
They're posted to a
village outside Paris.

00:10:58.452 --> 00:10:59.910
They spend a couple
weeks in Paris.

00:10:59.910 --> 00:11:01.140
They go to Switzerland
and hang out

00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:03.790
in Madame de Stael's salon,
one of the famous intellectuals

00:11:03.790 --> 00:11:04.460
of the day.

00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:05.820
Go visit the glacier.

00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:07.950
You know, it's very much
a gilded imprisonment,

00:11:07.950 --> 00:11:09.480
to say the least.

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:12.190
He hates every minute of
it and complains about it

00:11:12.190 --> 00:11:14.430
all the time, because the
war is still going on.

00:11:14.430 --> 00:11:17.100
He's missing a chance to
make a name for himself.

00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:19.660
When the war is over,
he's sent back to Prussia.

00:11:19.660 --> 00:11:23.800
And here he gets involved in
the Prussian Reform Movement.

00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:26.830
And what this is,
briefly, is Prussia

00:11:26.830 --> 00:11:28.570
was shattered by this war.

00:11:28.570 --> 00:11:31.170
Prussia before the war,
Prussia after the war.

00:11:31.170 --> 00:11:33.300
The French essentially
take half their country.

00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:36.060
The Prussians know they've got
to change how they do things.

00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:39.480
They've got to tap into
this nationalist sentiment

00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:41.177
that the French had tapped into.

00:11:41.177 --> 00:11:43.010
They've got to make the
Prussian people more

00:11:43.010 --> 00:11:44.630
supportive of the
Prussian state,

00:11:44.630 --> 00:11:46.439
give them an interest
in the state.

00:11:46.439 --> 00:11:47.730
They've got to reform the army.

00:11:47.730 --> 00:11:49.360
They've got to reform
the government.

00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:52.577
Clausewitz is very
heavily involved in this.

00:11:52.577 --> 00:11:54.160
He also becomes the
instructor of what

00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:55.710
becomes their war college.

00:11:55.710 --> 00:11:59.010
And he also begins to write
as well during this period

00:11:59.010 --> 00:12:03.510
and starts developing some of
the ideas that will eventually

00:12:03.510 --> 00:12:05.870
show up in "On War."

00:12:05.870 --> 00:12:08.900
But also, he sees
by 1812 the way

00:12:08.900 --> 00:12:10.650
the political winds are blowing.

00:12:10.650 --> 00:12:13.220
And he sees that
Prussia is forced

00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:15.340
into an alliance with France.

00:12:15.340 --> 00:12:17.780
France is about
to invade Russia.

00:12:17.780 --> 00:12:21.000
Clausewitz doesn't want
to participate in anything

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:22.040
under the French flag.

00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:22.789
He hates Napoleon.

00:12:22.789 --> 00:12:24.563
He admires Napoleon's
military skill,

00:12:24.563 --> 00:12:26.460
but he hates him politically.

00:12:26.460 --> 00:12:28.410
And he doesn't want
anything to do with this.

00:12:28.410 --> 00:12:30.520
He thinks that Prussia
should rise up and fight.

00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:32.950
And so he writes just
gigantic political declaration

00:12:32.950 --> 00:12:36.680
which boils down to a cry,
in many ways, of violence,

00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:38.490
to rise up and fight
against France.

00:12:38.490 --> 00:12:40.910
But also, he says
some not nice things

00:12:40.910 --> 00:12:43.760
about a lot of the ruling
elites in the Prussia

00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:46.620
political system, which
wins him a lot of enemies

00:12:46.620 --> 00:12:47.620
and a lot of bad blood.

00:12:47.620 --> 00:12:49.820
And eventually, he just
resigns from the army

00:12:49.820 --> 00:12:52.060
in the midst of all of this--
from the Prussian army.

00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:53.686
And a lot of other
officers do as well,

00:12:53.686 --> 00:12:55.476
because there are a
lot of other officers--

00:12:55.476 --> 00:12:57.580
well, a few dozen others--
that feel the same way.

00:12:57.580 --> 00:13:02.220
And what he will do now is
go to his next war, the 1812

00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:04.810
invasion of Russia.

00:13:04.810 --> 00:13:07.260
If anyone knows anything
about the Napoleonic period,

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:09.070
they usually have heard
of this and usually

00:13:09.070 --> 00:13:12.690
know something about this
campaign, where essentially

00:13:12.690 --> 00:13:17.230
Napoleon tries to defeat the
Russians in order to-- it would

00:13:17.230 --> 00:13:18.940
make him master of
Europe essentially

00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:21.030
if he does this, at
least of the continent.

00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:23.480
Clausewitz is involved
in this campaign

00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:28.000
from the first day it starts
to the very bitter end of it.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.440
And it's just a gruesome
bloodletting the entire time.

00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:34.860
And everyone knows about how
bad the winter is on the troops

00:13:34.860 --> 00:13:38.840
here, but the summer is
also pretty grueling on it.

00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:40.840
Essentially, you have
a French invasion,

00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:44.710
and the Russians retreat in the
face of the French invasion.

00:13:44.710 --> 00:13:48.200
Clausewitz initially is on
one of the extended versions

00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:50.340
of the czar's staff
through his connections

00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:52.439
with various officers
and politicians,

00:13:52.439 --> 00:13:53.730
but he doesn't want to do this.

00:13:53.730 --> 00:13:56.210
He wants to have a posting
where he'll see some action,

00:13:56.210 --> 00:13:57.749
because, again,
here's the ambition.

00:13:57.749 --> 00:13:59.290
He wants to make a
name from himself.

00:13:59.290 --> 00:14:01.581
He says, I'm going to Russia
to make a name for myself.

00:14:01.581 --> 00:14:03.170
I can't do it on the staff.

00:14:03.170 --> 00:14:06.040
And so he ends up fighting in
several rear guard actions,

00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:08.450
because that's where you can
make a name for yourself.

00:14:08.450 --> 00:14:10.460
So he gets posted
to the rear guard.

00:14:10.460 --> 00:14:13.515
Eventually, he will participate
in the Battle of Borodino.

00:14:13.515 --> 00:14:15.360
As the French
advance, the Russians

00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:17.600
decide, well, here's where
we have to fight them,

00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:19.190
see if we can stop them.

00:14:19.190 --> 00:14:21.930
And he's fortunate in
this battle in the sense

00:14:21.930 --> 00:14:26.100
that he misses the worst
of the bloodletting of it.

00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:28.435
And you can see, it's
about 130,000 men involved.

00:14:28.435 --> 00:14:30.810
You have 65,000 casualties.

00:14:30.810 --> 00:14:32.860
It's a serious slug fest.

00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:36.050
You have French troops
attacking Russian positions.

00:14:36.050 --> 00:14:38.060
Clausewitz is involved
in the cavalry attack

00:14:38.060 --> 00:14:40.518
that the Russians launch, try
to launch on this flank here,

00:14:40.518 --> 00:14:43.820
and they have a firefight with
some French and Croatian troops

00:14:43.820 --> 00:14:45.012
here.

00:14:45.012 --> 00:14:47.220
Essentially, the Russians
fight them to a standstill.

00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:49.336
They begin their retreat
toward Moscow again.

00:14:49.336 --> 00:14:50.960
Clausewitz goes back
to the rear guard.

00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:53.770
Has a horse shot out from under
him in one action on the way

00:14:53.770 --> 00:14:54.630
to Moscow.

00:14:54.630 --> 00:14:56.750
He sees the famous
burning of Moscow.

00:14:56.750 --> 00:15:00.170
He's in one of the last
units that go through that.

00:15:00.170 --> 00:15:04.000
And after this, he gets himself
posted to yet another unit.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.930
They're constantly shuffling him
around from different places.

00:15:06.930 --> 00:15:09.620
He's supposed to go work in this
unit called the Russo-German

00:15:09.620 --> 00:15:11.954
Legion as one of the
staff officers for that.

00:15:11.954 --> 00:15:13.370
It's a unit that
the Russians were

00:15:13.370 --> 00:15:17.200
forming from German exiles like
him and from prisoners of war.

00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:19.620
They were doing it
for political reasons.

00:15:19.620 --> 00:15:21.940
But the unit is not
put together yet.

00:15:21.940 --> 00:15:23.420
So he doesn't want
to sit around,

00:15:23.420 --> 00:15:26.070
and so he gets
himself posted to work

00:15:26.070 --> 00:15:27.686
for a man named Wittgenstein.

00:15:27.686 --> 00:15:28.810
Now, what is happened here?

00:15:28.810 --> 00:15:32.480
This is one the other famous
events of the Russian invasion,

00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:34.690
Napoleon's crossing
of the Berezina.

00:15:34.690 --> 00:15:38.340
It's well known for just
the harshness of the weather

00:15:38.340 --> 00:15:41.170
and the messiness of it,
the causalities of it,

00:15:41.170 --> 00:15:44.560
and very much the destruction
of Napoleon's army.

00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:46.640
What the Russians
try to do-- they

00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:50.200
have an army under Wittgenstein,
an army under Kutuzov,

00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:52.860
an army under Chichagov,
which I'm sure

00:15:52.860 --> 00:15:55.190
I'm mispronouncing
that one, and they're

00:15:55.190 --> 00:15:56.590
trying to catch Napoleon's army.

00:15:56.590 --> 00:15:59.630
Napoleon fights his way
through them and gets away.

00:15:59.630 --> 00:16:03.570
But the destruction here at
the crossing of the river

00:16:03.570 --> 00:16:04.490
is enormous.

00:16:04.490 --> 00:16:05.360
And you can see
from-- I'm not going

00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:07.109
to read the letter for
you, but Clausewitz

00:16:07.109 --> 00:16:09.660
experiences very much this.

00:16:09.660 --> 00:16:13.890
But also in the wake of this,
as the French are retreating,

00:16:13.890 --> 00:16:17.760
he will get the opportunity to
make a very significant impact

00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:20.790
on warfare during the Napoleonic
period or the shape of it,

00:16:20.790 --> 00:16:22.390
but not in the way he wants.

00:16:22.390 --> 00:16:24.570
He wants to make
a name for himself

00:16:24.570 --> 00:16:26.670
as a soldier, as
a combat soldier,

00:16:26.670 --> 00:16:28.540
make a name for
himself in the field.

00:16:28.540 --> 00:16:29.800
Again, he's very ambitious.

00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:36.160
But what will happen is as the
French and their other ally

00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:39.120
troops are retreating
from Russia, the unit

00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:41.340
that Clausewitz is
in will make contact

00:16:41.340 --> 00:16:42.930
with the Prussian
Expeditionary Corps.

00:16:42.930 --> 00:16:44.430
Now, you remember,
the Prussians had

00:16:44.430 --> 00:16:47.466
been forced to ally with
France to invade Russia.

00:16:47.466 --> 00:16:48.840
But the Prussians
had been forced

00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:51.170
to commit an army to
help them do this.

00:16:51.170 --> 00:16:53.350
As Napoleon is retreating,
the Prussian troops

00:16:53.350 --> 00:16:56.980
are also retreating in a
different part of Russia.

00:16:56.980 --> 00:16:59.090
Clausewitz's unit comes
in contact with this.

00:16:59.090 --> 00:17:01.080
He worked for this man
here named Diebitsch.

00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:03.180
And Diebitsch says,
hey, talk to them

00:17:03.180 --> 00:17:05.230
and see if you can get
them to change sides.

00:17:05.230 --> 00:17:07.780
And the other Russians had
been trying to do this.

00:17:07.780 --> 00:17:09.849
Clausewitz talks to
them and after a couple

00:17:09.849 --> 00:17:11.772
days of conversations--
and there's certainly

00:17:11.772 --> 00:17:12.480
some willingness.

00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:15.190
A lot of the Prussians didn't
want to be here anyway.

00:17:15.190 --> 00:17:17.640
They agree to change sides
essentially in the war.

00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:21.940
And this is a pivotal thing
for the Napoleonic period

00:17:21.940 --> 00:17:24.270
because it shifts the
alliance structure

00:17:24.270 --> 00:17:25.319
in what is going on here.

00:17:25.319 --> 00:17:28.040
This is a thing, arguably,
that in his military career

00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:29.920
that Clausewitz
accomplishes that

00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:32.650
is the most important thing,
because what you will have

00:17:32.650 --> 00:17:35.170
happen on the tail
of this is you

00:17:35.170 --> 00:17:37.880
will have yet
Clausewitz's next war.

00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:41.436
And this is a gigantic
campaign in 1813 and 1814

00:17:41.436 --> 00:17:43.580
with an armistice
in the middle, which

00:17:43.580 --> 00:17:45.180
is a campaign that
will eventually

00:17:45.180 --> 00:17:48.750
lead to the first
overthrow of Napoleon.

00:17:48.750 --> 00:17:51.280
Clausewitz, he tries to get
back in the Prussian army.

00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:54.510
The king isn't real happy
with what he's done.

00:17:54.510 --> 00:17:56.630
And the king tells
him essentially,

00:17:56.630 --> 00:17:59.300
well, fight in this campaign.

00:17:59.300 --> 00:18:02.890
We'll see how you do and then
we'll talk about it afterwards.

00:18:02.890 --> 00:18:07.430
So he gets himself detailed
to his old friend Scharnhorst

00:18:07.430 --> 00:18:08.910
here, who is
essentially the chief

00:18:08.910 --> 00:18:10.770
of staff for the
Prussian army here.

00:18:10.770 --> 00:18:13.145
And so he goes to the staff
as a Russian liaison officer.

00:18:13.145 --> 00:18:15.103
So technically, he's
still in the Russian army,

00:18:15.103 --> 00:18:16.640
but he's back with
all the people

00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:18.279
that he knew from before.

00:18:18.279 --> 00:18:19.945
And he will help fight
in this campaign.

00:18:19.945 --> 00:18:22.320
And he will also help
plan this campaign.

00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:24.070
And one of the places
where he will fight

00:18:24.070 --> 00:18:28.190
is the Battle of Lutzen here,
which it's a real slugfest.

00:18:28.190 --> 00:18:31.290
Napoleon, the French
commander, defeats

00:18:31.290 --> 00:18:35.825
the Russian-Prussian army
that comes against him.

00:18:35.825 --> 00:18:38.640
Clausewitz calls this the most
memorable day of his life.

00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:41.570
And he says this, I think,
one, because the intensity

00:18:41.570 --> 00:18:42.680
of the battle.

00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:45.439
The sides were so mixed in, and
the Prussians and the Russians

00:18:45.439 --> 00:18:46.980
were-- essentially,
the entire staff,

00:18:46.980 --> 00:18:48.813
which normally would
not have participated--

00:18:48.813 --> 00:18:51.155
is also fighting hand-to-hand
at times in this battle.

00:18:51.155 --> 00:18:53.030
And Clausewitz is hit
on the side of the head

00:18:53.030 --> 00:18:55.020
with a bayonet in
what was probably

00:18:55.020 --> 00:18:57.480
a cavalry charge against
a French infantry

00:18:57.480 --> 00:18:59.290
square, certainly a
French infantry unit.

00:18:59.290 --> 00:19:00.720
That would make
it memorable to me

00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:03.440
if I'd been hit on the
head with a bayonet.

00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:07.230
So what you will see
after the armistice

00:19:07.230 --> 00:19:10.170
is a gigantic campaign
that the Austrians, who

00:19:10.170 --> 00:19:12.670
enter the war, the
Prussians, and the Russians

00:19:12.670 --> 00:19:15.330
will then launch
through central Germany

00:19:15.330 --> 00:19:17.040
and into France
that will eventually

00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:20.430
lead to Napoleon's downfall.

00:19:20.430 --> 00:19:24.260
But to Clausewitz, this is kind
of a disappointing campaign

00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:25.190
in a couple senses.

00:19:25.190 --> 00:19:30.250
One, the primary campaign
is through central Germany

00:19:30.250 --> 00:19:31.440
and into France.

00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:34.220
He is posted up here into the
northern part of Germany--

00:19:34.220 --> 00:19:35.700
here's the city
Hamburg, province

00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:38.050
of Mecklenburg--
through what is very

00:19:38.050 --> 00:19:40.960
much a peripheral
part of the war.

00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:41.990
He's very upset by this.

00:19:41.990 --> 00:19:43.640
He tries to get this reversed.

00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:44.380
He doesn't.

00:19:44.380 --> 00:19:46.338
They won't let him back
into the Prussian army,

00:19:46.338 --> 00:19:48.300
so he's still technically
in the Russian army.

00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:51.480
So he's put in this
multinational force fighting

00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:54.490
in northern Germany.

00:19:54.490 --> 00:19:56.770
The coalition warfare
here is extremely

00:19:56.770 --> 00:19:58.304
complex and confusing.

00:19:58.304 --> 00:20:00.470
You have so many different
countries involved in it.

00:20:00.470 --> 00:20:04.310
But to boil it down, what
has happened is this man

00:20:04.310 --> 00:20:08.495
here was a former
French marshal,

00:20:08.495 --> 00:20:10.672
a very important officer
in the French army--

00:20:10.672 --> 00:20:11.630
a man named Bernadotte.

00:20:11.630 --> 00:20:14.480
He becomes the Crown
Prince of Sweden.

00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:16.720
The other countries-- the
Prussians, the Russians,

00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:19.449
the Austrians-- want him to
bring Sweden into the war.

00:20:19.449 --> 00:20:21.990
He says, OK, I'll bring Sweden
into the war against Napoleon.

00:20:21.990 --> 00:20:23.300
I want Norway.

00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:24.447
OK, you can have Norway.

00:20:24.447 --> 00:20:25.780
Well, Norway belongs to Denmark.

00:20:25.780 --> 00:20:30.240
OK, so we have to invade
Denmark for you to get Norway.

00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:31.810
This is the way
business is done.

00:20:31.810 --> 00:20:35.600
They trade countries around
like they're poker chips.

00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:38.720
And so Clausewitz ends
up in this army that's

00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:40.120
Bernadotte's army,
but he ends up

00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:45.230
working for this man named
Walmoden in Walmoden's corps.

00:20:45.230 --> 00:20:47.610
Walmoden's corps is one of
the-- and some of the units

00:20:47.610 --> 00:20:48.735
in it are the oddest units.

00:20:48.735 --> 00:20:52.730
He's got Russians and
Prussians and various Germans.

00:20:52.730 --> 00:20:55.677
The unit that Clausewitz is
technically a part of-- I

00:20:55.677 --> 00:20:57.260
looked at their
roster-- it's supposed

00:20:57.260 --> 00:20:59.040
to be the Russo-German legion.

00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:00.990
It's got some Germans in it.

00:21:00.990 --> 00:21:02.470
It's got some Russians in it.

00:21:02.470 --> 00:21:06.540
It's got Frenchman,
Italians, Poles, and even

00:21:06.540 --> 00:21:08.700
found a couple of Americans
listed on the roster.

00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:11.710
So obviously not what it was
originally intended to be.

00:21:11.710 --> 00:21:13.675
But why does this
campaign matter

00:21:13.675 --> 00:21:15.050
here is the most
important thing.

00:21:15.050 --> 00:21:17.680
Well, again, one,
Clausewitz was ambitious.

00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:19.222
He wants to make a
name for himself.

00:21:19.222 --> 00:21:20.680
How do you make a
name for yourself

00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:21.940
in the peripheral theater?

00:21:21.940 --> 00:21:23.870
He's very much angered by that.

00:21:23.870 --> 00:21:26.400
But what will happen here is
they will fight a campaign

00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:29.510
through here into the
northern part of Germany

00:21:29.510 --> 00:21:31.110
and southern part of Denmark.

00:21:31.110 --> 00:21:33.415
And there will be
a battle here--

00:21:33.415 --> 00:21:35.930
a tiny battle for the Napoleonic
period-- in a town called

00:21:35.930 --> 00:21:36.960
[? Zeistet ?].

00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:39.790
And here what happens
is Clausewitz's unit

00:21:39.790 --> 00:21:42.150
is surprised by the
Danish army, and the Danes

00:21:42.150 --> 00:21:43.790
kick them around pretty hard.

00:21:43.790 --> 00:21:47.150
And after this is what
matters, because this

00:21:47.150 --> 00:21:48.000
worries Clausewitz.

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.230
Yes, they were defeated and it's
bad and the casualties are bad.

00:21:50.230 --> 00:21:52.646
But there are two things that
come out of it that matters.

00:21:52.646 --> 00:21:53.650
One, this is a defeat.

00:21:53.650 --> 00:21:56.110
This injures their
reputation of their corps.

00:21:56.110 --> 00:21:59.560
And he worries how this is
going to affect his future

00:21:59.560 --> 00:22:01.630
and the embarrassment
this causes.

00:22:01.630 --> 00:22:03.350
Defeat is not good.

00:22:03.350 --> 00:22:06.880
Secondly, one of the things
he writes after the battle,

00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:08.520
he writes one of his letters.

00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:10.280
He says, the
intelligence we had all

00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:12.230
said the Danes weren't there.

00:22:12.230 --> 00:22:14.547
Now in "On War," he's
very critical in parts

00:22:14.547 --> 00:22:16.130
of his book on war
about intelligence.

00:22:16.130 --> 00:22:18.350
He's very skeptical about it.

00:22:18.350 --> 00:22:20.650
Now, can you draw
a direct connection

00:22:20.650 --> 00:22:22.246
between this one event and that?

00:22:22.246 --> 00:22:24.120
I would say it would be
very difficult to do.

00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:26.570
I would say it's more of an
example of his experience,

00:22:26.570 --> 00:22:29.470
because so much of the time he
is the chief of staff officer.

00:22:29.470 --> 00:22:32.270
He's the guy handling
the intelligence.

00:22:32.270 --> 00:22:33.690
So I think some of it is that.

00:22:33.690 --> 00:22:35.920
They finish up this campaign
in Holland and Belgium.

00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:38.100
Not a lot dramatic
happens after this.

00:22:38.100 --> 00:22:41.460
And Napoleon is deposed.

00:22:41.460 --> 00:22:45.150
But then Clausewitz goes
to yet his fifth war.

00:22:45.150 --> 00:22:48.620
And Napoleon escapes,
comes back to France,

00:22:48.620 --> 00:22:51.062
becomes emperor of France
again for a short time.

00:22:51.062 --> 00:22:52.520
The various countries
he was at war

00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:54.590
with before mobilize
against him.

00:22:54.590 --> 00:22:57.420
And what you will see is one of
the other most famous campaigns

00:22:57.420 --> 00:22:59.790
of the Napoleonic period,
the Waterloo campaign.

00:22:59.790 --> 00:23:02.652
And Clausewitz does not fight in
the Battle of Waterloo itself,

00:23:02.652 --> 00:23:04.360
but he fights in a
couple of other places

00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:05.320
during the campaign.

00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:07.732
One in the Battle of Ligny here.

00:23:07.732 --> 00:23:09.440
He is chief of staff
for Thielmann corps,

00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:10.869
3rd Corps of the Prussian army.

00:23:10.869 --> 00:23:12.160
He's back in the Prussian army.

00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:13.610
They finally let him back in.

00:23:13.610 --> 00:23:16.050
And so he fights in
this Battle of Ligny.

00:23:16.050 --> 00:23:18.020
His unit is not committed
very heavily there.

00:23:18.020 --> 00:23:20.200
They're mostly
used as a reserve.

00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:22.685
But when the Prussian army
is defeated here by Napoleon

00:23:22.685 --> 00:23:25.245
and comes apart, he has
this harrowing retreat

00:23:25.245 --> 00:23:27.540
where he's almost
overrun by French cavalry

00:23:27.540 --> 00:23:29.730
and they have to march all
night through the rain.

00:23:29.730 --> 00:23:31.657
But then right
after this, they'll

00:23:31.657 --> 00:23:32.740
fight the Battle of Wavre.

00:23:32.740 --> 00:23:33.930
Now why does Wavre matter?

00:23:33.930 --> 00:23:37.610
Well, here you have Waterloo
where Napoleon is defeated.

00:23:37.610 --> 00:23:39.430
Here you have the
Battle of Wavre.

00:23:39.430 --> 00:23:41.970
This battle matters for
a couple of reasons.

00:23:41.970 --> 00:23:44.740
One, because they
tied down a lot

00:23:44.740 --> 00:23:46.910
of the troops, a whole
corps that Napoleon

00:23:46.910 --> 00:23:49.180
could have had in
support at Waterloo.

00:23:49.180 --> 00:23:51.230
And if he'd had those
men at Waterloo,

00:23:51.230 --> 00:23:53.460
maybe then the battle
goes differently.

00:23:53.460 --> 00:23:55.420
Maybe not, but maybe it does.

00:23:55.420 --> 00:23:57.180
And this sort of critical.

00:23:57.180 --> 00:23:59.450
For Clausewitz, it's the
worst night of his life.

00:23:59.450 --> 00:24:02.600
And they fight a two-day battle
here against a superior force.

00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:05.400
They're defeated here
and forced to retreat.

00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:08.930
And Clausewitz's
wife writes later

00:24:08.930 --> 00:24:11.480
about why he thought
this was such a bad day.

00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:15.330
Well, in his mind, why it was
the worst night of his life

00:24:15.330 --> 00:24:18.330
because he knows
now he's not going

00:24:18.330 --> 00:24:20.750
to get the chance to ever get
the military glory that he

00:24:20.750 --> 00:24:21.250
wants.

00:24:21.250 --> 00:24:22.460
He's not going to have
it, because they've

00:24:22.460 --> 00:24:24.220
learned during their
battle that Napoleon

00:24:24.220 --> 00:24:25.750
has been some severely defeated.

00:24:25.750 --> 00:24:28.290
They know, yes, the war will
go on for a few more weeks,

00:24:28.290 --> 00:24:35.950
but the conclusion's pretty
foregone at this point.

00:24:35.950 --> 00:24:37.190
Now, what happens after this?

00:24:37.190 --> 00:24:39.760
1815, Napoleon is deposed.

00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:42.400
Clausewitz will have a couple
of jobs in the Prussian army

00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:42.950
after this.

00:24:42.950 --> 00:24:47.040
But in 1818, he goes to be the
director of the Prussian War

00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:48.120
College.

00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:51.284
And this is primarily
an administrative job,

00:24:51.284 --> 00:24:52.700
and so it gives
him time to write.

00:24:52.700 --> 00:24:55.500
He's always been writing during
this period-- history, theory,

00:24:55.500 --> 00:24:58.900
politics, even stuff on
art and architecture.

00:24:58.900 --> 00:25:01.140
In 1816, he begins to
write "On War," which

00:25:01.140 --> 00:25:02.890
is what he's most famous for.

00:25:02.890 --> 00:25:06.200
And 1818, he will really
start seriously pursuing it.

00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:08.460
And he will work
on it until 1830,

00:25:08.460 --> 00:25:13.580
when he boxes it up and
then takes up a new command.

00:25:13.580 --> 00:25:15.580
And then eventually
he'll go and watch

00:25:15.580 --> 00:25:18.350
the Polish revolt in 1831.

00:25:18.350 --> 00:25:20.550
He won't publish the
book before he dies.

00:25:20.550 --> 00:25:22.910
His wife will
publish it afterward.

00:25:22.910 --> 00:25:26.597
And so we might not have it
if it wasn't for her efforts

00:25:26.597 --> 00:25:28.680
to put it together with
some friends to publish it

00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:30.110
and some of his other works.

00:25:30.110 --> 00:25:31.700
Now, why does "On War" matter?

00:25:31.700 --> 00:25:34.190
Well, "On War" matters
because of the influence

00:25:34.190 --> 00:25:37.060
that it has in the way that
people think about war.

00:25:37.060 --> 00:25:40.210
And it's not a book that
tells you how to fight a war.

00:25:40.210 --> 00:25:42.750
It's a book that tells you
how to think about fighting

00:25:42.750 --> 00:25:45.208
a war and things you should
consider and things that matter

00:25:45.208 --> 00:25:46.790
and what the reality
of war he is.

00:25:46.790 --> 00:25:48.720
He's trying to make
us develop, arguably,

00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:50.610
a system for analysis.

00:25:50.610 --> 00:25:53.840
So what I'm going to talk about
here just very, very briefly,

00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:55.830
a couple of things
about "On War."

00:25:55.830 --> 00:25:57.830
I'm going to cherry pick
some things, obviously,

00:25:57.830 --> 00:26:00.060
because it's a very large book.

00:26:00.060 --> 00:26:04.260
To Clausewitz, theory was
really very important--

00:26:04.260 --> 00:26:07.300
having a theory, a method
for approaching things.

00:26:07.300 --> 00:26:09.040
It clarified things
in your mind.

00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:12.230
It put you on a foundation
for what you want to do,

00:26:12.230 --> 00:26:13.570
a level playing field.

00:26:13.570 --> 00:26:17.390
I think CS Lewis said-- I
think he said understanding

00:26:17.390 --> 00:26:20.320
the terms of your argument,
knowing where that is makes you

00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:23.340
better able to understand what
you're actually talking about.

00:26:23.340 --> 00:26:26.990
And to him, theory, though,
has to be realistic-- not

00:26:26.990 --> 00:26:28.525
hairsplitting, not
flights of fancy.

00:26:28.525 --> 00:26:31.350
It has to be based on
reality, based on experience,

00:26:31.350 --> 00:26:35.060
based upon history,
particularly military theory.

00:26:35.060 --> 00:26:38.660
It's not something you just
make up with this ethereal idea.

00:26:38.660 --> 00:26:39.940
It has to be something useful.

00:26:39.940 --> 00:26:41.480
And to train the mind.

00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:44.250
Now, one of things
he does in the book,

00:26:44.250 --> 00:26:46.770
he's trying to set up
to explain what war is.

00:26:46.770 --> 00:26:49.030
Well, what is it?

00:26:49.030 --> 00:26:51.070
And you could get
different views.

00:26:51.070 --> 00:26:54.710
Obviously, for him, force
is an inherent part of it.

00:26:54.710 --> 00:26:58.270
To think of anything less than
this is delusional in his mind.

00:26:58.270 --> 00:27:01.390
But it's not a
science in his view.

00:27:01.390 --> 00:27:02.719
It's an art.

00:27:02.719 --> 00:27:05.260
It's an art because there are
these things you can't measure.

00:27:05.260 --> 00:27:10.380
These intangibles-- the will,
the spirit, courage, and so on.

00:27:10.380 --> 00:27:12.840
But there are scientific things
that obviously intervene--

00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:14.631
how many men do you
need, how much are they

00:27:14.631 --> 00:27:16.440
going to eat, how far
can you move them,

00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:18.760
what is the ammunition going
to cost you, and so on.

00:27:18.760 --> 00:27:21.051
So there are various things
where they're hard numbers,

00:27:21.051 --> 00:27:24.370
but how this all works together.

00:27:24.370 --> 00:27:25.610
Obviously, complex.

00:27:25.610 --> 00:27:28.780
You could make an argument that
war is the most complex things

00:27:28.780 --> 00:27:30.760
that people do--
except maybe marriage.

00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:32.310
That might trump
it a little bit.

00:27:32.310 --> 00:27:33.976
But it's certainly
pretty close to being

00:27:33.976 --> 00:27:35.490
the best or most complex.

00:27:35.490 --> 00:27:36.730
It's a political act.

00:27:36.730 --> 00:27:39.914
Bob mentioned earlier the
famous quote from Clausewitz,

00:27:39.914 --> 00:27:41.830
"War is nothing but the
continuation of policy

00:27:41.830 --> 00:27:44.360
with other means or
politics by other means,"

00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:45.627
the political tool.

00:27:45.627 --> 00:27:47.460
And one of the things
that some people argue

00:27:47.460 --> 00:27:50.620
that separates Clausewitz's
theory from others

00:27:50.620 --> 00:27:55.920
is the fact that how much
the role of politics--

00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:58.000
it penetrates his theory
and is shot through it.

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:02.460
And it helps to explain
what he is thinking about.

00:28:02.460 --> 00:28:06.170
Because to Clausewitz,
war and reality--

00:28:06.170 --> 00:28:10.070
its influence is determined
by these various things.

00:28:10.070 --> 00:28:12.000
The political
factors always go on,

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:14.760
the politics always go
on, even while you're

00:28:14.760 --> 00:28:18.520
fighting, the human nature, the
moral force, the intangibles we

00:28:18.520 --> 00:28:20.950
talked about-- chance,
uncertainty, friction,

00:28:20.950 --> 00:28:22.370
the uncontrollable factors.

00:28:22.370 --> 00:28:25.280
The enemy gets a vote
on what's going on.

00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:28.060
He calls war a true chameleon.

00:28:28.060 --> 00:28:30.291
So what would
Clausewitz say about how

00:28:30.291 --> 00:28:32.790
do you think about fighting a
war-- what do you think about,

00:28:32.790 --> 00:28:35.820
what do you do before you're
getting into this thing?

00:28:35.820 --> 00:28:37.720
And he would say,
well, really, you

00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:39.750
have to understand the
nature of it first.

00:28:39.750 --> 00:28:43.310
He said the leadership has
to get this in their mind

00:28:43.310 --> 00:28:44.690
before they do anything.

00:28:44.690 --> 00:28:46.080
What kind of war is it?

00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:47.720
What is the war about?

00:28:47.720 --> 00:28:49.374
It's nice and easy
to say-- understand

00:28:49.374 --> 00:28:50.290
the nature of the war.

00:28:50.290 --> 00:28:51.940
OK, what in the
world does that mean?

00:28:51.940 --> 00:28:54.104
Well, how do you do that?

00:28:54.104 --> 00:28:55.895
There's one paragraph
here from Clausewitz.

00:28:55.895 --> 00:28:59.180
He says, "To discover how
much of our resources must be

00:28:59.180 --> 00:29:02.650
mobilized for war, we must
first examine our own political

00:29:02.650 --> 00:29:05.079
aim"-- or objective--
"and that of the enemy.

00:29:05.079 --> 00:29:06.745
We must gauge the
strength and situation

00:29:06.745 --> 00:29:07.682
of the opposing state.

00:29:07.682 --> 00:29:10.140
We must gauge the character
and abilities of its government

00:29:10.140 --> 00:29:12.830
and people, and do the
same in regard to our own.

00:29:12.830 --> 00:29:15.380
Finally, we must evaluate
the political sympathies

00:29:15.380 --> 00:29:18.750
of other states and the effect
the war may have on them.

00:29:18.750 --> 00:29:21.910
To assess these things and all
the ramifications and diversity

00:29:21.910 --> 00:29:24.620
is plainly a colossal task."

00:29:24.620 --> 00:29:26.750
I put this one
particular paragraph up

00:29:26.750 --> 00:29:31.940
because to me, just in this
one little section, is so much.

00:29:31.940 --> 00:29:33.780
That if countries
or planners that

00:29:33.780 --> 00:29:36.030
are thinking about
getting into a war,

00:29:36.030 --> 00:29:39.970
just examining these
things can give you so much

00:29:39.970 --> 00:29:42.020
of a clue potentially
as to what can happen

00:29:42.020 --> 00:29:44.900
and what you're going to need
to do to fight the war-- knowing

00:29:44.900 --> 00:29:47.290
what you want, figuring out
how you're going to get it,

00:29:47.290 --> 00:29:50.486
and how it's going to affect
other nations, as well.

00:29:50.486 --> 00:29:51.860
Now, how else do
you to determine

00:29:51.860 --> 00:29:53.000
the nature of the war?

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:56.300
Well, in his mind, first
be clear in his mind what

00:29:56.300 --> 00:30:00.220
he intends to achieve--
your political objective.

00:30:00.220 --> 00:30:04.000
Get that first, then figure out
how you're going to conduct it.

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:06.070
Because in Clausewitz's
mind, understanding

00:30:06.070 --> 00:30:09.264
what you want-- everything else
is going to flow from that.

00:30:09.264 --> 00:30:10.180
Rationally, it should.

00:30:10.180 --> 00:30:11.130
It may not necessarily.

00:30:11.130 --> 00:30:12.046
But ideally it should.

00:30:12.046 --> 00:30:13.890
It should flow from that.

00:30:13.890 --> 00:30:16.990
If there's anybody that has
read any similar things,

00:30:16.990 --> 00:30:19.030
you hear the word
"objectives" or "aims,"

00:30:19.030 --> 00:30:20.730
but you hear the term
"ends and means."

00:30:20.730 --> 00:30:24.850
What you want-- what is the
end that you're hoping to get?

00:30:24.850 --> 00:30:26.800
Do you have the means to get it?

00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:30.350
Can you get to that point
that you're trying to get to?

00:30:30.350 --> 00:30:32.370
Is it worth it?

00:30:32.370 --> 00:30:34.740
Is it worth what we're going
to pay in blood, treasure,

00:30:34.740 --> 00:30:36.170
prestige, and so on?

00:30:36.170 --> 00:30:38.270
Do you have the power to get it?

00:30:38.270 --> 00:30:41.470
If you do, well, use the
force necessary to get it.

00:30:41.470 --> 00:30:44.700
Do what is necessary
to get the job done.

00:30:44.700 --> 00:30:46.760
So again, the political
object for him--

00:30:46.760 --> 00:30:49.980
how it determines all
of these other things.

00:30:49.980 --> 00:30:53.610
He talks about what he calls
the value of the object.

00:30:53.610 --> 00:30:55.890
He says, "Since war is not
an act of senseless passion

00:30:55.890 --> 00:30:57.700
but is controlled by
its political object,

00:30:57.700 --> 00:31:00.660
the value of the object must
determine the sacrifices to be

00:31:00.660 --> 00:31:03.760
made for it in magnitude
and also in duration.

00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:05.430
Once the expenditure
effort exceeds

00:31:05.430 --> 00:31:07.040
the value of the
political object,

00:31:07.040 --> 00:31:09.622
the object must be renounced
and peace must follow."

00:31:09.622 --> 00:31:11.330
In other words, when
countries go to war,

00:31:11.330 --> 00:31:12.680
they have things they want.

00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:14.300
They will only pay
so much for it--

00:31:14.300 --> 00:31:16.430
in blood, treasure,
other things.

00:31:16.430 --> 00:31:18.044
Once one side is
unwilling to pay,

00:31:18.044 --> 00:31:20.460
he argues that-- again, you
don't have to agree with him--

00:31:20.460 --> 00:31:24.760
but he argues somebody will
make a deal at that point.

00:31:24.760 --> 00:31:28.620
Now, he says also, well,
we know our object.

00:31:28.620 --> 00:31:30.950
What kind of object do we
have, or political objective

00:31:30.950 --> 00:31:32.270
do we have?

00:31:32.270 --> 00:31:35.870
To Clausewitz, wars are
divided into two types.

00:31:35.870 --> 00:31:37.570
There's a war fought
for regime change--

00:31:37.570 --> 00:31:39.920
to overthrow the enemy regime.

00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:42.590
And then every other
reason less than that.

00:31:42.590 --> 00:31:46.734
In his view, wars fall
under these two types.

00:31:46.734 --> 00:31:48.150
Now also, if you
read the book, he

00:31:48.150 --> 00:31:50.640
will put forward this
concept of absolute war.

00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:55.310
And this is confusing
sometimes for people.

00:31:55.310 --> 00:31:57.200
And it leads to a
lot of the criticism

00:31:57.200 --> 00:31:58.810
that you get of Clausewitz.

00:31:58.810 --> 00:32:01.180
We're saying, oh, he says
everything has to be used

00:32:01.180 --> 00:32:03.420
and war must be fought
at an absolute sense.

00:32:03.420 --> 00:32:06.427
He actually says-- he uses this
as a theoretical construct.

00:32:06.427 --> 00:32:07.885
He puts up the idea
of the absolute

00:32:07.885 --> 00:32:10.750
and says war can't
really be waged this way.

00:32:10.750 --> 00:32:12.800
Meaning, you're not
going to use everything,

00:32:12.800 --> 00:32:15.060
and everything is
not going to work,

00:32:15.060 --> 00:32:17.590
because reality intervenes.

00:32:17.590 --> 00:32:20.860
People don't always do
what they should do.

00:32:20.860 --> 00:32:23.090
Friction keeps you
from doing what you do.

00:32:23.090 --> 00:32:24.940
You don't have the
intelligence you want.

00:32:24.940 --> 00:32:26.730
It's uncertain, and so on.

00:32:26.730 --> 00:32:29.290
So he uses a theoretical
concept to explain

00:32:29.290 --> 00:32:31.820
what war is really like.

00:32:31.820 --> 00:32:36.170
So we've got our objective
and we know the value of it.

00:32:36.170 --> 00:32:38.925
But the paragraph I showed
you, which is essentially

00:32:38.925 --> 00:32:41.330
an assessment-- how
do you figure out

00:32:41.330 --> 00:32:44.370
the nature of the enemy,
the character of the enemy,

00:32:44.370 --> 00:32:46.220
his abilities, his
military strength?

00:32:46.220 --> 00:32:49.440
Well, he puts forward some
tools, arguably one of them

00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:50.723
that would be useful for this.

00:32:50.723 --> 00:32:54.490
It is called his "paradoxical"
or "wondrous trinity,"

00:32:54.490 --> 00:32:56.740
depending which
translation you use.

00:32:56.740 --> 00:32:58.790
And he says, "As
a total phenomenon

00:32:58.790 --> 00:33:00.910
its dominant
tendencies always make

00:33:00.910 --> 00:33:02.745
war a paradoxical
trinity-- composed

00:33:02.745 --> 00:33:05.410
of primordial violence,
hatred, and enmity, which

00:33:05.410 --> 00:33:08.240
are to be regarded as a blind
natural force, of the play

00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:10.830
of chance and probability within
which the creative spirit is

00:33:10.830 --> 00:33:13.346
free to roam, and of its
element of subordination,

00:33:13.346 --> 00:33:14.720
as an instrument
of policy, which

00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:16.650
makes it subject
to reason alone.

00:33:16.650 --> 00:33:19.420
The first of these aspects
mainly concerns the people--"

00:33:19.420 --> 00:33:21.327
violence-- back to the
French Revolution--

00:33:21.327 --> 00:33:22.160
primordial violence.

00:33:22.160 --> 00:33:26.700
Passion-- you want the
passion of the people

00:33:26.700 --> 00:33:28.160
to help you fight the war.

00:33:28.160 --> 00:33:30.760
"The second, the
commander and his army"--

00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:34.290
the creative spirit is free to
roam, chance and probability.

00:33:34.290 --> 00:33:36.670
War is the realm of chance,
the realm of probability.

00:33:36.670 --> 00:33:39.360
The army and its leaders have
to be able to manage this.

00:33:39.360 --> 00:33:41.735
And "third, the government"--
instrument of policy.

00:33:41.735 --> 00:33:43.110
In other words,
the assumption is

00:33:43.110 --> 00:33:46.072
that the government goes to
war for rational reasons.

00:33:46.072 --> 00:33:47.780
Either it's forced to
defend the country,

00:33:47.780 --> 00:33:49.820
or if fighting an
offensive war, then it

00:33:49.820 --> 00:33:51.620
has a good reason for doing it.

00:33:51.620 --> 00:33:55.220
It's not doing this just
because it wants to.

00:33:55.220 --> 00:33:58.680
So it's these three forces--
violence, creativity,

00:33:58.680 --> 00:34:01.580
rationality-- the people,
the government, the army.

00:34:01.580 --> 00:34:03.550
But he says, well,
sometimes it doesn't really

00:34:03.550 --> 00:34:05.300
work this way, because
sometimes governments

00:34:05.300 --> 00:34:06.883
will go to war for
passionate reasons.

00:34:06.883 --> 00:34:08.670
They will not
really think clearly

00:34:08.670 --> 00:34:11.969
about what they're doing and
not have a clear objective.

00:34:11.969 --> 00:34:15.000
So you look at
the strengths, you

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:17.260
look at the society-- the
military, the government,

00:34:17.260 --> 00:34:17.980
and so on.

00:34:17.980 --> 00:34:20.580
Then you say, well, where
am I going to land my blows?

00:34:20.580 --> 00:34:23.389
Where is my force going
to be put against?

00:34:23.389 --> 00:34:25.909
And he puts forth this concept
of the center of gravity

00:34:25.909 --> 00:34:28.719
and essentially
argues that countries

00:34:28.719 --> 00:34:31.870
have elements of power--
elements of national power--

00:34:31.870 --> 00:34:33.790
certain key strengths.

00:34:33.790 --> 00:34:36.550
And in his view, these-- the
army, the capital, the allies,

00:34:36.550 --> 00:34:38.389
the leader, public
opinion-- it depends

00:34:38.389 --> 00:34:39.805
on various different
things, which

00:34:39.805 --> 00:34:42.380
one matters-- that one
or all of these things

00:34:42.380 --> 00:34:45.120
will be key sources of
strength of a nation.

00:34:45.120 --> 00:34:48.880
And ideally, you should
go after these if you can.

00:34:48.880 --> 00:34:50.630
The reality is
sometimes you can't.

00:34:50.630 --> 00:34:53.651
And also, with Clausewitz,
these are things you should do,

00:34:53.651 --> 00:34:54.150
he will say.

00:34:54.150 --> 00:34:55.389
But you always
have an exception.

00:34:55.389 --> 00:34:57.388
There's always an exception
to any of his rules.

00:34:57.388 --> 00:34:59.614
You say, well,
ideally, yes, you want

00:34:59.614 --> 00:35:01.030
to go after the
center of gravity.

00:35:01.030 --> 00:35:03.130
But sometimes,
there's an opportunity

00:35:03.130 --> 00:35:05.090
that is so great
and so beneficial

00:35:05.090 --> 00:35:07.210
that you go after that as well.

00:35:07.210 --> 00:35:09.810
There's some other
objective worth pursuing.

00:35:09.810 --> 00:35:11.860
So you know where you're
landing your blow,

00:35:11.860 --> 00:35:13.290
you're fighting your war.

00:35:13.290 --> 00:35:14.290
How do you end the war?

00:35:14.290 --> 00:35:18.250
Well, he says, ultimately,
you really want to make sure

00:35:18.250 --> 00:35:20.650
you are getting what you want.

00:35:20.650 --> 00:35:22.615
You're preserving your state.

00:35:22.615 --> 00:35:24.740
You're trying to get
ultimately a peace treaty that

00:35:24.740 --> 00:35:26.010
will resolve the conflict.

00:35:26.010 --> 00:35:27.843
And you have a settlement
that hopefully you

00:35:27.843 --> 00:35:30.730
can live with that you've
paid an acceptable cost for.

00:35:30.730 --> 00:35:33.590
But ideally, that's what
you want-- final victory.

00:35:33.590 --> 00:35:36.671
But how do you get to that
ends up being the question.

00:35:36.671 --> 00:35:37.920
You have to keep that in mind.

00:35:37.920 --> 00:35:41.190
What do you do militarily
to get to this point?

00:35:41.190 --> 00:35:44.994
And again, with so much of
things like this, it depends.

00:35:44.994 --> 00:35:46.160
It depends on the situation.

00:35:46.160 --> 00:35:49.330
There's no just template
for fighting any war.

00:35:49.330 --> 00:35:50.205
How do you get there?

00:35:50.205 --> 00:35:51.770
You might destroy
the enemy's forces,

00:35:51.770 --> 00:35:54.370
you might take his territory,
you might occupy parts of him,

00:35:54.370 --> 00:35:56.890
you might do something else
that will bring him around

00:35:56.890 --> 00:35:58.250
to your point of view.

00:35:58.250 --> 00:35:59.750
But what you're
also hoping to get

00:35:59.750 --> 00:36:02.380
is eventually a settlement
that is lasting.

00:36:02.380 --> 00:36:05.510
But he says the reality
is a lot of countries

00:36:05.510 --> 00:36:08.280
and a lot of leaders, yes,
they will make a deal with you,

00:36:08.280 --> 00:36:09.660
but they don't
intend to keep it.

00:36:09.660 --> 00:36:12.650
For them, he calls a
"transitory evil," as he says.

00:36:12.650 --> 00:36:15.170
I think this is certainly drawn
from his study of history,

00:36:15.170 --> 00:36:18.090
and some from his experience
in the Napoleonic wars, where

00:36:18.090 --> 00:36:21.050
the wars are fought
maybe a year or two.

00:36:21.050 --> 00:36:22.490
And then you take a break.

00:36:22.490 --> 00:36:25.780
And then maybe a couple years
later, you fight it again.

00:36:25.780 --> 00:36:31.250
So in 1831, Clausewitz will die
as a result of the big cholera

00:36:31.250 --> 00:36:34.600
epidemic that sweeps
through Europe.

00:36:34.600 --> 00:36:37.020
His wife, along
with some friends,

00:36:37.020 --> 00:36:41.950
will publish "On War" and a
lot of his other works as well.

00:36:41.950 --> 00:36:45.950
And it is generally--
not always certainly,

00:36:45.950 --> 00:36:49.360
but is generally-- considered
the best theoretical work

00:36:49.360 --> 00:36:51.149
on war, the best
military theory on war.

00:36:51.149 --> 00:36:53.190
There are obviously things
you can argue with it.

00:36:53.190 --> 00:36:56.330
Again, some things that
some would say are obsolete.

00:36:56.330 --> 00:36:58.790
But with it, he gives
us a good method

00:36:58.790 --> 00:37:02.170
for thinking about
war, for doing analysis

00:37:02.170 --> 00:37:05.320
and trying to figure out
what we're doing and why.

00:37:05.320 --> 00:37:07.690
But there are, of course,
other books of theory as well.

00:37:07.690 --> 00:37:10.140
It's certainly not the only one.

00:37:10.140 --> 00:37:11.240
Well, thank you very much.

00:37:11.240 --> 00:37:15.150
And I'll take any
questions you might have.

00:37:15.150 --> 00:37:17.837
[APPLAUSE]

00:37:17.837 --> 00:37:19.420
AUDIENCE: Is there
anything Clausewitz

00:37:19.420 --> 00:37:22.400
has to say that you find
has become particularly

00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:27.550
relevant in current conflicts
or with current technology?

00:37:27.550 --> 00:37:30.310
DONALD STOKER: With the
technology, I don't know.

00:37:30.310 --> 00:37:32.970
But with the current
conflicts, just

00:37:32.970 --> 00:37:38.100
really having a clear idea
in your mind what you want

00:37:38.100 --> 00:37:41.530
and why you're sending
people there to get it.

00:37:41.530 --> 00:37:45.470
Knowing that and then
saying, is it worth it?

00:37:45.470 --> 00:37:47.820
Particularly really knowing
what you want, I think,

00:37:47.820 --> 00:37:48.734
is always relevant.

00:37:48.734 --> 00:37:50.150
Because if you
know what you want,

00:37:50.150 --> 00:37:54.591
then that arguably should
spark some thought.

00:37:54.591 --> 00:37:56.090
AUDIENCE: So it
would be fair to say

00:37:56.090 --> 00:37:58.835
he was critical
of mission creep?

00:37:58.835 --> 00:38:01.210
DONALD STOKER: Critical would
be the wrong word, I think,

00:38:01.210 --> 00:38:01.710
to say.

00:38:01.710 --> 00:38:03.342
Because the reality
would be sometimes

00:38:03.342 --> 00:38:05.800
the mission will change because
sometimes the circumstances

00:38:05.800 --> 00:38:07.200
will change.

00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:09.840
But if you know what
you want going in,

00:38:09.840 --> 00:38:12.227
then maybe you don't
get the mission creep.

00:38:12.227 --> 00:38:13.810
But then the
circumstance will change.

00:38:13.810 --> 00:38:15.559
Maybe you're forced
to have mission creep.

00:38:18.260 --> 00:38:20.410
AUDIENCE: I know it was
kind of early for this,

00:38:20.410 --> 00:38:23.020
but with all of his
interest in theory,

00:38:23.020 --> 00:38:26.780
do you know if Clausewitz
did anything with war games

00:38:26.780 --> 00:38:30.990
or laying stuff out on
tables, that sort of thing?

00:38:30.990 --> 00:38:33.007
DONALD STOKER:
Honestly, I don't know.

00:38:33.007 --> 00:38:35.340
He participated in a lot of
real maneuvers in real wars,

00:38:35.340 --> 00:38:38.030
but I honestly
don't know on that.

00:38:38.030 --> 00:38:40.050
I never caught that anywhere.

00:38:40.050 --> 00:38:42.800
But he did like
counterfactual studies,

00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:44.674
where here's a problem.

00:38:44.674 --> 00:38:46.090
Let's think about
the various ways

00:38:46.090 --> 00:38:47.690
we can approach this problem.

00:38:47.690 --> 00:38:50.670
And here is the solution.

00:38:50.670 --> 00:38:54.400
Well, one of things he said,
if someone sets out their plan

00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:57.250
and you criticize it, you
better have a better option.

00:38:57.250 --> 00:38:59.833
If you're just criticizing and
you don't have a better choice,

00:38:59.833 --> 00:39:01.470
then who cares what you say?

00:39:01.470 --> 00:39:03.710
You've got to wonder about that.

00:39:03.710 --> 00:39:07.730
AUDIENCE: So you talked about
how he saw the ongoing conflict

00:39:07.730 --> 00:39:12.200
in Europe as a way of making
a career and a fact of life.

00:39:12.200 --> 00:39:14.290
But does he ever talk
about the morality of it?

00:39:14.290 --> 00:39:17.606
Say, if he saw where today the
Swedes and Danes are no longer

00:39:17.606 --> 00:39:19.480
fighting, attacking each
other for territory,

00:39:19.480 --> 00:39:22.063
would he be disappointed to hear
they're no longer doing that?

00:39:22.063 --> 00:39:23.589
Would he see it
as an improvement?

00:39:23.589 --> 00:39:25.380
Does he ever talk about
the morality of it?

00:39:26.900 --> 00:39:31.700
DONALD STOKER: The book
is really-- to them,

00:39:31.700 --> 00:39:34.990
war is man's natural
state in many ways.

00:39:34.990 --> 00:39:38.230
And you could argue
almost that if you

00:39:38.230 --> 00:39:40.720
look at the certainly the
shape of European history,

00:39:40.720 --> 00:39:42.320
it's sadly that way.

00:39:42.320 --> 00:39:45.750
The book is a non-moral
approach to war.

00:39:45.750 --> 00:39:48.810
He certainly understood the
reality of it but to him,

00:39:48.810 --> 00:39:50.840
this is the reality of it.

00:39:50.840 --> 00:39:54.300
As far as what he would
say about today, honestly

00:39:54.300 --> 00:39:55.850
I don't know.

00:39:55.850 --> 00:39:58.244
I think he would be-- like
what I mentioned related

00:39:58.244 --> 00:39:59.660
to his question,
I think, the lack

00:39:59.660 --> 00:40:03.222
of clarity about what people
want would always confuse him.

00:40:03.222 --> 00:40:05.430
But he would say the same
thing about his own people.

00:40:05.430 --> 00:40:07.870
He criticizes his own
government for not knowing

00:40:07.870 --> 00:40:10.830
what it wants and criticizes
them for their behavior

00:40:10.830 --> 00:40:12.660
afterward in some
wars, and gets himself

00:40:12.660 --> 00:40:15.122
in trouble sometimes doing it.

00:40:15.122 --> 00:40:16.580
AUDIENCE: It's a
two-part question.

00:40:16.580 --> 00:40:18.380
So the first is,
why do you think

00:40:18.380 --> 00:40:20.167
Clausewitz's work has
been so influential?

00:40:20.167 --> 00:40:22.500
And second, what are some of
the real-world applications

00:40:22.500 --> 00:40:23.000
of that?

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:25.980
Like, where in history have
we seen his influence really

00:40:25.980 --> 00:40:27.830
has shaped events?

00:40:27.830 --> 00:40:32.590
DONALD STOKER: As
far as why, I haven't

00:40:32.590 --> 00:40:35.280
read most of the other
primary theoretical works.

00:40:35.280 --> 00:40:36.420
And we teach some others.

00:40:36.420 --> 00:40:37.680
We teach Mahan.

00:40:37.680 --> 00:40:38.420
We teach Sun Tzu.

00:40:38.420 --> 00:40:41.340
We teach Corbett's "Principles
of Maritime Strategy,"

00:40:41.340 --> 00:40:45.530
which there are no boats
in Clausewitz's world.

00:40:45.530 --> 00:40:49.510
But the others are
certainly useful.

00:40:49.510 --> 00:40:52.980
His, to me-- and others would
disagree, certainly-- to me,

00:40:52.980 --> 00:40:56.920
it gives a clarity of thought
and a systemization of thought

00:40:56.920 --> 00:40:58.140
which is useful.

00:40:58.140 --> 00:41:01.780
And plus he does give
us-- one of the reasons we

00:41:01.780 --> 00:41:05.640
use it to teach with, it gives
us terms to define things

00:41:05.640 --> 00:41:08.627
and it gives us
tools for analysis.

00:41:08.627 --> 00:41:11.210
When we're teaching one of our
case studies and we'll say, OK,

00:41:11.210 --> 00:41:13.110
what is the American
center of gravity?

00:41:13.110 --> 00:41:15.210
And this gives us certain things
that we could look at and say,

00:41:15.210 --> 00:41:16.751
we know what center
of gravities are.

00:41:16.751 --> 00:41:19.600
How do we look at the strengths
or weaknesses of an enemy?

00:41:19.600 --> 00:41:21.809
It's very useful for that.

00:41:21.809 --> 00:41:23.600
As far as your second
question-- I'm sorry,

00:41:23.600 --> 00:41:24.540
what was your second
question again?

00:41:24.540 --> 00:41:25.831
You'll have to repeat it to me.

00:41:25.831 --> 00:41:28.289
AUDIENCE: Where do we see
real-world applications?

00:41:28.289 --> 00:41:29.830
DONALD STOKER:
Clausewitz's influence

00:41:29.830 --> 00:41:32.480
was actually slow to develop.

00:41:32.480 --> 00:41:34.680
There just wasn't that
much interest in it

00:41:34.680 --> 00:41:35.910
for a very long time.

00:41:35.910 --> 00:41:38.120
People started taking
more of an interest in it

00:41:38.120 --> 00:41:40.995
after the
Franco-Prussian War, 1870

00:41:40.995 --> 00:41:46.360
to '71, where the Prussians
come out successful in that.

00:41:46.360 --> 00:41:50.020
And you see a general,
then, spread of his ideas.

00:41:50.020 --> 00:41:51.950
It was fairly
influential with Lenin.

00:41:51.950 --> 00:41:56.200
He liked the idea that
war is a political tool.

00:41:56.200 --> 00:41:58.450
He said, this is clever.

00:41:58.450 --> 00:42:02.100
You see it with some
American foreign policy,

00:42:02.100 --> 00:42:03.980
but only after Vietnam.

00:42:03.980 --> 00:42:07.190
And you see it particularly
in the Reagan administration.

00:42:07.190 --> 00:42:09.630
There's an argument over
how you use military force.

00:42:09.630 --> 00:42:11.580
You've certainly got the
post-Vietnam hangover

00:42:11.580 --> 00:42:13.510
about that and you
have certain groups

00:42:13.510 --> 00:42:16.230
of the administration that
are more hawkish than others.

00:42:16.230 --> 00:42:18.540
Some want to intervene
in places, some don't.

00:42:18.540 --> 00:42:23.550
And you end up with
Caspar Weinberger.

00:42:23.550 --> 00:42:25.460
He develops this
Weinberger Doctrine, which

00:42:25.460 --> 00:42:30.650
is some elements based upon
Clausewitz's teachings, where

00:42:30.650 --> 00:42:32.162
having a clear
political objective,

00:42:32.162 --> 00:42:34.620
understand the end you want,
understand the means you want,

00:42:34.620 --> 00:42:37.299
make sure you have the support
of the people to do this.

00:42:37.299 --> 00:42:38.840
If the people aren't
supportive of it

00:42:38.840 --> 00:42:40.673
and the government isn't
supportive of this,

00:42:40.673 --> 00:42:42.260
then we should
really be questioning

00:42:42.260 --> 00:42:44.830
whether we're doing this
and whether it's worth it.

00:42:44.830 --> 00:42:47.820
That's the best examples
of the influence of it.

00:42:47.820 --> 00:42:51.340
I think it's had more influence
among military thinking

00:42:51.340 --> 00:42:53.240
and analysis than
among politicians.

00:42:56.134 --> 00:42:58.300
AUDIENCE: I was wondering
if you could say something

00:42:58.300 --> 00:43:02.470
about how Clausewitz's "On War"
compares with say, Sun Tzu's

00:43:02.470 --> 00:43:05.040
"Art of War" or [INAUDIBLE].

00:43:05.040 --> 00:43:08.550
What are the points of sharpest
similarity or sharpest contrast

00:43:08.550 --> 00:43:10.550
between the other books?

00:43:11.495 --> 00:43:14.120
DONALD STOKER: Actually, when we
teach our theorist case study,

00:43:14.120 --> 00:43:17.210
we use Clausewitz and
Sun Tzu at the same time.

00:43:17.210 --> 00:43:21.300
And so we can get some
back and forth with them.

00:43:21.300 --> 00:43:24.030
One of the things that's
very similar to them

00:43:24.030 --> 00:43:28.010
is both of them
understanding-- look,

00:43:28.010 --> 00:43:31.200
figure out what you're
getting yourself into here.

00:43:31.200 --> 00:43:33.721
Clausewitz says,
look, war is violence.

00:43:33.721 --> 00:43:34.720
People are going to die.

00:43:34.720 --> 00:43:35.460
It's going to be expensive.

00:43:35.460 --> 00:43:36.770
And it's going to be messy.

00:43:36.770 --> 00:43:38.770
Understand that
before you go in.

00:43:38.770 --> 00:43:40.070
It better be worth it to you.

00:43:40.070 --> 00:43:41.236
Sun Tzu says the same thing.

00:43:41.236 --> 00:43:43.056
He has a passage where
he tells the king,

00:43:43.056 --> 00:43:44.472
he says, look,
when you go to war,

00:43:44.472 --> 00:43:45.470
it's going to cost you this.

00:43:45.470 --> 00:43:46.900
You've got to raise
an army like this.

00:43:46.900 --> 00:43:48.420
People are going
to be mad at you.

00:43:48.420 --> 00:43:49.962
It's going to be
expensive and messy.

00:43:49.962 --> 00:43:51.545
Get this through
your head beforehand,

00:43:51.545 --> 00:43:52.560
it better be worth it.

00:43:52.560 --> 00:43:56.090
When Clausewitz talks about
his centers of gravity,

00:43:56.090 --> 00:43:59.073
Sun Tzu has his priorities
of attack, and some of them

00:43:59.073 --> 00:44:00.670
are exactly the same.

00:44:00.670 --> 00:44:03.880
He talks about hitting their
allies, he talks about cities,

00:44:03.880 --> 00:44:06.040
but he warns against it.

00:44:06.040 --> 00:44:11.040
So there's a lot of
similarities to that.

00:44:11.040 --> 00:44:14.310
Sun Tzu is much more in tune
with intelligence and deception

00:44:14.310 --> 00:44:17.710
and Clausewitz is not--
he's a little more

00:44:17.710 --> 00:44:19.490
skeptical of that than Sun Tzu.

00:44:19.490 --> 00:44:21.350
But they are really
fun to study together,

00:44:21.350 --> 00:44:24.720
because you get here's what
it's similar to, but also

00:44:24.720 --> 00:44:26.200
here's where they disagree.

00:44:28.990 --> 00:44:31.600
AUDIENCE: I think I have
the last question, myself.

00:44:31.600 --> 00:44:33.760
Take an example--
it's in the news

00:44:33.760 --> 00:44:38.400
right now-- Vladimir Putin
just got humiliated at the G20

00:44:38.400 --> 00:44:42.350
and sent home for his
Ukrainian adventures.

00:44:42.350 --> 00:44:45.719
What do you think his
objective really is in Ukraine?

00:44:45.719 --> 00:44:47.510
DONALD STOKER: I was
in New York last week,

00:44:47.510 --> 00:44:50.574
and I was involved in a
piece of a conversation

00:44:50.574 --> 00:44:51.740
with other people with that.

00:44:51.740 --> 00:44:56.262
And they were having an argument
about that, back and forth.

00:44:56.262 --> 00:44:57.720
Both the people
were very informed,

00:44:57.720 --> 00:45:00.460
so I don't know who
to believe on it.

00:45:00.460 --> 00:45:02.300
What are his objectives?

00:45:02.300 --> 00:45:04.450
Probably all of
Ukraine, a lot of people

00:45:04.450 --> 00:45:08.800
would say-- at least
the parts of the Ukraine

00:45:08.800 --> 00:45:11.970
that would allow him a
land bridge to the Crimea

00:45:11.970 --> 00:45:15.420
and connect to Moldava-- that's
another opinion that I've

00:45:15.420 --> 00:45:17.240
heard.

00:45:17.240 --> 00:45:21.540
Another opinion
that I've heard is

00:45:21.540 --> 00:45:23.800
that not only
Ukraine, but Belarus.

00:45:23.800 --> 00:45:26.810
Ukraine's the first
step in Belarus.

00:45:26.810 --> 00:45:30.819
And also there's a lot
of fear, apparently--

00:45:30.819 --> 00:45:32.860
and this is my opinion,
and from what I've heard,

00:45:32.860 --> 00:45:36.000
not the government--
there's a lot

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:40.200
of fear among prominent figures
in the Baltic states about what

00:45:40.200 --> 00:45:43.414
might be-- the big cyber-attack
they launched in the Estonians

00:45:43.414 --> 00:45:44.955
a couple years ago
and the kidnapping

00:45:44.955 --> 00:45:47.022
of the Estonian officer.

00:45:47.022 --> 00:45:49.230
And there's been a shifting
of all the Polish defense

00:45:49.230 --> 00:45:50.220
forces around.

00:45:50.220 --> 00:45:52.550
But basically, to look on
the border with Ukraine.

00:45:52.550 --> 00:45:56.040
But I don't know what he wants.

00:45:56.040 --> 00:45:58.610
I'm not a Russian
expert, by far.

00:45:58.610 --> 00:46:01.000
BOB: Let's thank Dr.
Stoker for coming here.

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:04.050
[APPLAUSE]
