00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:49.310
saw we saw new phenomena of crisis we
 

00:09:49.310 --> 00:09:53.140
saw we saw new phenomena of crisis we
saw the crisis virtual and in real

00:09:53.140 --> 00:09:53.150
saw the crisis virtual and in real
 

00:09:53.150 --> 00:09:57.810
saw the crisis virtual and in real
economy it was different things the

macroeconomic figures have been showing

00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:00.050
macroeconomic figures have been showing
 

00:10:00.050 --> 00:10:05.100
