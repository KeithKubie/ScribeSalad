00:00:08.216 --> 00:00:09.836
&gt;&gt;Student: There's
kids and there's a dog.

00:00:09.986 --> 00:00:11.516
It is sunny, there is no fog.

00:00:12.236 --> 00:00:12.816
There is a shadow--

00:00:12.816 --> 00:00:15.356
&gt;&gt;Narrator: These fifth graders
are presenting poems they wrote

00:00:15.356 --> 00:00:17.736
to acompany the digital
photographs they took.

00:00:17.736 --> 00:00:21.096
&gt;&gt;Student: I'm gonna go online
because I'm researching my topic,

00:00:21.096 --> 00:00:25.206
which is how to say "kite"
in different languages.

00:00:25.816 --> 00:00:27.446
&gt;&gt;Narrator: In this
fifth grade class,

00:00:27.446 --> 00:00:29.786
students are researching
and designing kites.

00:00:29.926 --> 00:00:31.476
&gt;&gt;Going down all right.

00:00:31.476 --> 00:00:33.736
&gt;&gt;Wow, that's-- that's a drop.

00:00:34.406 --> 00:00:37.096
&gt;&gt;Narrator: And these sixth
graders are conducting experiments

00:00:37.096 --> 00:00:40.056
to determine the heat of
fusion for various objects.

00:00:40.056 --> 00:00:42.936
&gt;&gt;If it is melting at
ninety-three point five--

00:00:43.546 --> 00:00:46.106
&gt;&gt;Narrator: These challenging
projects are part of a typical day

00:00:46.106 --> 00:00:49.206
at Mott Hall, a fourth
through eighth grade science,

00:00:49.306 --> 00:00:52.036
math and technology
magnet school in the heart

00:00:52.036 --> 00:00:53.576
of New York's Harlem district.

00:00:54.466 --> 00:00:58.076
&gt;&gt;Mirian: Traditionally, minority
students have not been encouraged

00:00:58.076 --> 00:01:02.296
or inspired to go into
the professional fields

00:01:02.296 --> 00:01:04.566
of mathematics, science
or technology.

00:01:05.086 --> 00:01:08.486
So we feel that our mission
here at Mott Hall is really

00:01:08.586 --> 00:01:12.876
to provide a very strong academic
foundation for these students

00:01:12.876 --> 00:01:15.566
to go onto higher learning.

00:01:16.066 --> 00:01:17.466
&gt;&gt;Student: Matter exists
in different phases,

00:01:17.776 --> 00:01:19.676
three of these are
solid, liquid and gas.

00:01:20.236 --> 00:01:22.626
The other two are Bose-Einstein
condensate and plasma,

00:01:22.836 --> 00:01:24.426
but these two are not
common on this planet.

00:01:25.126 --> 00:01:27.776
&gt;&gt;Narrator: In nineteen
ninety-five, the school participated

00:01:27.776 --> 00:01:31.126
in a pilot program that eventually
provided laptop computers

00:01:31.176 --> 00:01:32.986
to every teacher and student.

00:01:33.346 --> 00:01:37.466
&gt;&gt;Mirian: And when we put the
laptops and the technology directly

00:01:37.516 --> 00:01:42.386
into the hands of teachers and
students, we started to move

00:01:42.386 --> 00:01:47.966
from a more traditional instructional
model to a project based

00:01:47.966 --> 00:01:51.436
and constructivist model,
and we really embrace this

00:01:51.436 --> 00:01:55.576
as a school community, because
we feel that what is important

00:01:55.576 --> 00:01:58.326
for our students is for
them to be directors

00:01:58.326 --> 00:01:59.926
and managers of their own learning.

00:01:59.926 --> 00:02:03.946
&gt;&gt;What kind of poem would
you make out of that one?

00:02:04.116 --> 00:02:04.466
&gt;&gt;A silly one.

00:02:04.466 --> 00:02:08.356
&gt;&gt;Mirian: We really wanted to have
children collaborate with each other,

00:02:08.356 --> 00:02:13.276
have children engaged in
multidisciplinary types of projects

00:02:13.346 --> 00:02:15.216
that were longer, that
were more complex.

00:02:15.396 --> 00:02:17.116
&gt;&gt;What's the temperature
of the water?

00:02:17.456 --> 00:02:19.976
&gt;&gt;The water, measure the temperature.

00:02:20.816 --> 00:02:22.706
&gt;&gt;Mirian: We feel this
is more authentic,

00:02:22.706 --> 00:02:27.846
we feel this is more challenging work
for our students, and we have seen

00:02:27.846 --> 00:02:31.926
that it had yielded very
positive results for our students.

00:02:32.546 --> 00:02:35.116
&gt;&gt;Student: Using the graph
paper on the compouter,

00:02:35.116 --> 00:02:36.626
I've created a scale for my kite.

00:02:36.626 --> 00:02:40.926
&gt;&gt;Sandra: At this point in math,
we're studying ratio and proportion

00:02:41.046 --> 00:02:45.036
and they're difficult concepts,
especially for a ten year old.

00:02:45.296 --> 00:02:48.506
&gt;&gt;Narrator: For teachers like
Sandra Skea, who teaches math,

00:02:48.876 --> 00:02:52.636
science and social studies, the most
successful projects cover the whole

00:02:52.636 --> 00:02:55.226
curriculum and involve
new technologies.

00:02:56.116 --> 00:02:58.196
&gt;&gt;Sandra: For this
project, the laptops proved

00:02:58.276 --> 00:03:01.386
to be especially useful in
creating the scale drawings,

00:03:01.386 --> 00:03:04.976
in doing the research, and
be able to make revisions,

00:03:05.366 --> 00:03:07.826
in order that they could
set up ratio and proportion

00:03:07.826 --> 00:03:09.906
and see instantly what
the effects were.

00:03:10.186 --> 00:03:13.906
We have the wireless, so it
was easy for us to go online,

00:03:13.906 --> 00:03:15.336
get additional information.

00:03:15.436 --> 00:03:19.366
It's going to make the whole idea
of creating our website easy,

00:03:19.456 --> 00:03:21.886
because we've got most
of the work already done

00:03:21.886 --> 00:03:25.726
and it's just formatting it
and shooting it up to the net.

00:03:25.726 --> 00:03:29.466
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Skea believes projects
bring out the best in her students.

00:03:29.466 --> 00:03:32.786
She was particularly impressed with
the progress of one of her students

00:03:32.786 --> 00:03:35.336
who wrote a story about
Ben Franklin's kite.

00:03:36.076 --> 00:03:38.486
&gt;&gt;Student: He was going to make
me get shocked by the lightning.

00:03:38.866 --> 00:03:40.516
"No," I screamed, without
saying a word.

00:03:40.906 --> 00:03:42.936
He took me outside and
flew me in the air.

00:03:43.196 --> 00:03:45.926
I flew rapidly through the
sky, hoping not to get struck.

00:03:46.226 --> 00:03:48.206
Then Ben screamed, "Make me proud!"

00:03:48.556 --> 00:03:50.816
&gt;&gt;Sandra: Once he became
involved with projects,

00:03:50.936 --> 00:03:52.826
his interest in school really grew,

00:03:53.156 --> 00:03:56.476
and all his potential just
evolved, it just exploded.

00:03:56.926 --> 00:04:01.996
And now he consistently does is
work and has consistently done well,

00:04:02.336 --> 00:04:06.766
and he's no longer afraid to use
his imagination, to take risks,

00:04:07.386 --> 00:04:12.546
to try new things and I credit
a lot of that to the projects

00:04:12.546 --> 00:04:14.286
that he's been able
to get involved with.

00:04:14.926 --> 00:04:15.726
&gt;&gt;Narrator: At Mott Hall,

00:04:15.726 --> 00:04:17.986
the learning does not
stop when classes end.

00:04:18.236 --> 00:04:21.766
After school offerings
include tai chi and chess.

00:04:22.796 --> 00:04:24.176
&gt;&gt;Jerald: Chess does
a lot for young people

00:04:24.216 --> 00:04:25.706
and I think the most important thing,

00:04:25.706 --> 00:04:27.426
it makes them responsible
for their decisions.

00:04:28.156 --> 00:04:33.886
Every move has a consequence, and you
can see from the first year of chess,

00:04:33.886 --> 00:04:36.976
kids being a lot more
aware of the moves they do.

00:04:37.826 --> 00:04:40.766
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Practice like this
has helped make Mott Hall national

00:04:40.766 --> 00:04:41.836
chess champioins.

00:04:42.116 --> 00:04:45.916
It also dovetails neatly with the
school's educational philosophy.

00:04:46.636 --> 00:04:48.006
&gt;&gt;Jerald: I'm not even
really interested always

00:04:48.006 --> 00:04:48.636
in the right answer.

00:04:48.636 --> 00:04:50.156
If they come up with the
right answer, that's great,

00:04:50.196 --> 00:04:52.256
but I'm interested
in the investigation.

00:04:52.256 --> 00:04:54.456
Again, that interior dialog, "Well,
what were you thinking about?"

00:04:54.996 --> 00:04:56.286
&gt;&gt;Did you have some growth or no?

00:04:56.626 --> 00:04:58.006
&gt;&gt;Mm, yeah, it was decreasing.

00:04:58.586 --> 00:05:00.676
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The school has
also formed partnerships

00:05:00.676 --> 00:05:03.566
with nearby institutions like
City College of New York,

00:05:03.666 --> 00:05:05.556
where these eighth
graders are working

00:05:05.556 --> 00:05:09.086
on their class science project,
and advancing vital research

00:05:09.126 --> 00:05:10.886
on single celled organisms.

00:05:11.816 --> 00:05:14.966
&gt;&gt;Megan: When they first came, of
course, this was all completely new

00:05:15.036 --> 00:05:17.746
to them, so they didn't
know about foraminifera,

00:05:18.216 --> 00:05:19.326
not that I'd expect them to.

00:05:19.706 --> 00:05:20.996
They didn't know about
dinoflagellates,

00:05:21.556 --> 00:05:23.726
not that I would expect them to.

00:05:23.726 --> 00:05:26.116
They were interested though
in corollary ecosystems.

00:05:26.586 --> 00:05:30.386
They decided on their own that they
wanted to do the light variation,

00:05:30.486 --> 00:05:34.716
so I helped them, you know, set up
a sort of experimental protocol.

00:05:35.406 --> 00:05:37.536
And then once I showed them how

00:05:37.736 --> 00:05:40.176
to actually use the
instruments, it was amazing.

00:05:40.406 --> 00:05:44.376
They just were able to do all
the counts, totally unsupervised,

00:05:44.926 --> 00:05:47.776
and when they showed me their
board, I was really impressed,

00:05:48.026 --> 00:05:50.856
because they had found
all sorts of pictures

00:05:50.856 --> 00:05:53.536
and they put all the graphs together.

00:05:53.536 --> 00:05:56.766
Their data tables, they
had everything lined up,

00:05:56.836 --> 00:05:58.746
you know, absolutely perfectly.

00:05:59.026 --> 00:06:01.396
&gt;&gt;Do you think it's time that
we transferred them again?

00:06:01.756 --> 00:06:02.056
&gt;&gt;Transfer.

00:06:02.056 --> 00:06:02.616
&gt;&gt;Definitely?

00:06:03.216 --> 00:06:07.026
&gt;&gt;Susan: They'll talk to you about
these species of microorganisms just

00:06:07.096 --> 00:06:09.546
as if they were the
scientists in the labs,

00:06:09.546 --> 00:06:11.716
and that's exactly what we want,

00:06:11.916 --> 00:06:14.796
for them to feel not necessarily
they're gonna become scientists,

00:06:14.826 --> 00:06:17.646
but if that's what they
want to do, they can do it.

00:06:17.646 --> 00:06:18.666
&gt;&gt;This one, right?

00:06:18.666 --> 00:06:20.076
&gt;&gt;And that one.

00:06:20.076 --> 00:06:24.356
&gt;&gt;Student: I think it's a
privilege to be here, and I found it

00:06:24.496 --> 00:06:29.866
to be really fun, and it expanded
my horizons, like now I can see

00:06:29.866 --> 00:06:33.096
that I have more choices for a job.

00:06:33.756 --> 00:06:36.396
&gt;&gt;Megan: My experience
with this program has been

00:06:36.626 --> 00:06:39.786
that project based learning
is absolutely essential,

00:06:40.326 --> 00:06:43.736
because through the projects, the
students became more interested.

00:06:43.806 --> 00:06:45.106
They took their own initiative.

00:06:45.106 --> 00:06:47.686
Had this been from a
book or an article,

00:06:47.996 --> 00:06:50.936
I don't believe that
would've happened.

00:06:50.936 --> 00:06:51.636
&gt;&gt;Press collect.

00:06:52.056 --> 00:06:53.776
&gt;&gt;Marc: It's not just
project learning.

00:06:53.776 --> 00:06:58.266
It's really problem solving, it's
decision making, it's the opportunity

00:06:58.426 --> 00:07:01.656
to present your ideas,
to evaluate your ideas.

00:07:02.056 --> 00:07:04.316
There are rooms that
you can walk into

00:07:04.316 --> 00:07:06.026
and it looks like chaos, you know.

00:07:06.246 --> 00:07:10.936
It's rooms full of kids, moving
in all directions, sharing work,

00:07:10.936 --> 00:07:11.986
but it's very productive.

00:07:11.986 --> 00:07:16.336
It's productive noise, it's
noise of ideas being shared.

00:07:16.336 --> 00:07:17.446
&gt;&gt;Sixty-six point five.

00:07:18.046 --> 00:07:19.846
&gt;&gt;Marc: Of products being produced.

00:07:19.846 --> 00:07:20.356
&gt;&gt;Let me see that.

00:07:20.806 --> 00:07:22.996
&gt;&gt;Marc: There's an excitement
in that type of classroom.

00:07:22.996 --> 00:07:24.806
Anyone who enters the
room is learning.

00:07:24.806 --> 00:07:27.376
&gt;&gt;Whoa, from the seesaw, I
think it went up and down.

00:07:30.806 --> 00:07:32.766
