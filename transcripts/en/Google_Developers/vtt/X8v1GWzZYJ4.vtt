[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.409 --> 00:00:07.900
JONAS JONJEGAN: Hi, I'm Jonas.

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:09.066
HENRY ROWLEY: Hi, I'm Henry.

00:00:11.702 --> 00:00:14.160
JONAS JONJEGAN: Quick, Draw is
a game a few of us at Google

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.430
made.

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:17.430
You draw, and the computer
uses machine learning

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.770
to guess what you're drawing.

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.360
AI: I see square, or
suitcase, or canoe.

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:25.674
Oh, I know, it's shoe.

00:00:25.674 --> 00:00:27.090
JONAS JONJEGAN:
It's an experiment

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.840
that uses some of the
same technology that

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:31.871
helps Google Translate
recognize your handwriting.

00:00:31.871 --> 00:00:34.080
HENRY ROWLEY: To understand
handwriting or drawings,

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:36.170
you don't just look at
what the person drew.

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:38.195
You look at how they
actually drew it.

00:00:38.195 --> 00:00:40.062
Which strokes did
they make first?

00:00:40.062 --> 00:00:41.645
Which direction did
they draw them in?

00:00:41.645 --> 00:00:44.040
You train the computer on
millions of characters,

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.600
from hundreds of languages.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.270
And over time, it learns
whether you wrote look

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:49.354
or whether you wrote book.

00:00:49.354 --> 00:00:50.936
JONAS JONJEGAN:
Training is a big part

00:00:50.936 --> 00:00:53.390
of how the computer can guess
your drawings correctly.

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:56.206
As people, it's easy for us to
look at these three drawings

00:00:56.206 --> 00:00:57.330
and know they are all cats.

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:00.080
But to a computer,
they're very different.

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:01.260
One is just the head.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.250
One has a full body.

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.459
And one is just facial features.

00:01:04.459 --> 00:01:05.940
To get the computer
to understand,

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:07.980
you have to show it
a lot of cat doodles.

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:10.100
And then it starts
to see patterns,

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:11.820
like that almost
all doodles of cats

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.690
have pointy ears, a
small nose, and whiskers.

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:17.580
Of course it
doesn't always work.

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.960
That's because it's only
seen a few thousand doodles.

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.210
But the more you play with
it, the more it will learn,

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:24.210
and the better it
will get at guessing.

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.389
AI: Oh I know, it's cat.

00:01:25.389 --> 00:01:27.930
JONAS JONJEGAN: We put it on
the web for anyone to play with.

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.840
We hope it inspires other
people to think about fun ways

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.300
to use machine learning.

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:35.540
