00:00:04.066 --> 00:00:06.216
&gt;&gt;Kristin: I will load
up three or four problems

00:00:06.566 --> 00:00:07.786
and I'll have them in pairs.

00:00:07.986 --> 00:00:09.376
I'll hand them the one iPad.

00:00:09.376 --> 00:00:12.176
It is possible to actually
use one iPad and get this done

00:00:12.176 --> 00:00:14.036
in a class, 'cause
that's all I have.

00:00:14.036 --> 00:00:15.396
And I'll say, "All right,

00:00:15.396 --> 00:00:17.296
you teach him how
to do this problem."

00:00:17.596 --> 00:00:19.376
And you can get help
from the person next

00:00:19.376 --> 00:00:20.006
to you if you need it.

00:00:20.006 --> 00:00:20.976
It's okay, it's a team process.

00:00:22.046 --> 00:00:25.906
&gt;&gt;Student: MD is
twenty-one and D equals RD.

00:00:27.046 --> 00:00:28.126
&gt;&gt;Kristin: When they're
finished, I save it

00:00:28.366 --> 00:00:30.546
and then I'll pull up a
problem very similar to it,

00:00:30.546 --> 00:00:31.916
and I'll hand it
to their partner.

00:00:32.116 --> 00:00:34.976
And say, "Okay, now it's your
turn, you do the same thing."

00:00:35.046 --> 00:00:36.056
&gt;&gt;Okay, this is a question.

00:00:36.216 --> 00:00:37.766
Make sure you read the
question carefully.

00:00:38.296 --> 00:00:39.046
&gt;&gt;Student: Thank you.

00:00:39.796 --> 00:00:40.000
&gt;&gt;Kristin: Okay.

00:00:41.046 --> 00:00:43.696
&gt;&gt;And they hand it back to
me, I make sure it's all saved

00:00:43.696 --> 00:00:44.976
and then I move on
to another pair.
