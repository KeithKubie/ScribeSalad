00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:02.440
Okay, in this lesson,

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:08.710
we're going to dive into how do we fill
a dataframe with the data that we want.

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:11.720
And we're also going
to touch upon a couple

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:15.550
issue that we had that were pointed
out in the previous lesson.

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:20.180
For instance, remember when we had that
issue that the dates were actually in

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:24.090
the reverse order when we loaded
them in, we're going to fix that.

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.660
We're going to fix
a couple other things too.

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:30.470
Okay, just to refresh your memory,
here's the kind of stuff that goes in

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:35.430
a dataframe, our columns are the
particular symbols of stocks that we're

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.050
interested in, and our rows are dates.

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.650
So time, goes from the top of
the dataframe down to the bottom, and

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:45.470
symbols, from left to right.
