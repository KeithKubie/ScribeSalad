00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.570
PROFESSOR: Welcome
back to recitation.

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.720
In this video I want us to
work on the following problem.

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:16.400
So we're going to assume little
f is a continuous function.

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.380
And if we know that the integral
from 0 to x of f of t dt

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:24.470
is equal to x
squared sine pi x, I

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:27.305
want us to find little f of 2.

00:00:27.305 --> 00:00:28.930
So I'm going to give
you a little while

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:30.080
to work on the problem.

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.990
When you're ready, come
back and we'll take a look

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:34.130
at how I do the problem.

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:44.010
Welcome back.

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.510
So again, we're
working on a problem

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.800
where we know that f is
a continuous function.

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.450
We know that the integral
from 0 to x of f of t dt

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:52.820
is equal to a certain function.

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.477
And we want to find f of 2.

00:00:55.477 --> 00:00:57.060
So what we're going
to use, because we

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:59.050
know little f is
continuous, we can actually

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:01.520
use the fundamental
theorem of calculus.

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:06.650
And we know that d/dx
of this whole expression

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:09.950
here is actually little f of x.

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:12.925
So let's just remind us--
I'll write it down formally.

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:26.395
FTC implies that d/dx, the
interval from 0 to x f of t dt

00:01:26.395 --> 00:01:27.186
is equal to f of x.

00:01:27.186 --> 00:01:27.686
Right?

00:01:27.686 --> 00:01:29.960
We know that.

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:35.680
So, we know that d/dx
of the right-hand side

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:39.190
and d/dx of the left-hand
side are the same.

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:41.910
And so we know that if we take
d/dx of the right-hand side,

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:43.040
we'll get little f of x.

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:47.200
Because d/dx of the left-hand
side of this equation

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.680
is little f of x.

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:52.430
So d/dx of the right-hand
side is also little f of x.

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:54.360
So now what we
have to do is apply

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.900
what we know about taking
derivatives to find little

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:59.090
f of x.

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:00.630
Then once we find
little f of x we

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.880
can evaluate it at f equal 2,
at 2-- sorry-- at x equal 2.

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.210
Sorry about that.

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:10.370
So let's come over to the
right part of the board

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:13.530
and we'll find d/dx
of this function here.

00:02:21.747 --> 00:02:22.830
So what do we have to use?

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.496
We have to use the
product rule and then

00:02:24.496 --> 00:02:27.420
we'll have to use a little chain
rule, a really simple chain

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.286
rule in the second term.

00:02:29.286 --> 00:02:30.660
I'm going to write
it down below,

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:31.770
so we have some room here.

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:36.550
So the first term,
we get 2x sine pi*x.

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:38.690
The second term
we get x squared.

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:41.010
Derivative of sine is cosine.

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:41.690
pi*x.

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:44.210
And then we have
to pull out a pi.

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:48.940
Which I'll just put, well I'll
put it here for the moment.

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.980
The pi comes from taking
the derivative of pi*x.

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:56.670
And now all we need, this
is then f of x, right?

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.610
So I just will remind
us this is f of x.

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:02.920
Let me put it right
here, a little f of x.

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.570
So if I want to find f
of 2, all I have to do

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:09.100
is evaluate this at x equal 2.

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:13.450
So f of 2 is going to
equal-- 2 times 2 is 4--

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:20.050
sine 2*pi plus 4-- I'll
bring the pi in front--

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:23.040
4*pi cosine 2*pi.

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.610
So what do I get?

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:27.010
Sine 2*pi is 0.

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:28.970
Cosine 2*pi is 1.

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:32.669
So ultimately, I just get 4*pi.

00:03:32.669 --> 00:03:34.710
So, hopefully you were
able to solve this problem

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:36.950
and get the same answer.

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:40.220
Now let me remind you,
one more time what we did.

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:41.440
Let's come over here.

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:44.410
We started with a function
that we knew was continuous.

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:47.760
We knew the integral from
0 to x of that function

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.610
was equal to a
certain function of x.

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:53.447
And we wanted to evaluate
this function at a certain,

00:03:53.447 --> 00:03:55.430
at a certain point.

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:57.430
So what we exploited was
the fundamental theorem

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:58.986
of calculus.

00:03:58.986 --> 00:04:00.610
And the fundamental
theorem of calculus

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:06.010
tells us that d/dx of the
left-hand side is f of x.

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:09.260
And so that we can take
d/dx of the right-hand side

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.070
and figure out what f of x is.

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:13.290
And then we just evaluate.

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:15.240
So I think I'll stop there.
