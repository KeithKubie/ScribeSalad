DAVE GOLDBERG: Thank you, first
of all, for having me.

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:07.950
I'm going to give a very
general talk today.

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:13.020
The talk is one of these things
where the table itself

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:15.230
is going to give away,
basically, the crux of it,

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:17.520
which is why symmetry matters.

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.730
Now I would not be the least bit
surprised if in a Google

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.500
audience, some small-- perhaps
some large-- fraction of you

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.480
were physics majors
in college.

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:28.730
Just out of curiosity--

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:31.880
one, two, three, et cetera.

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:36.240
I stopped counting after three,
perhaps out of ability.

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:39.970
But one of things that is not
obvious-- even, by the way, as

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:41.990
a physics major in college--

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:46.000
is the sort of shorthand that
physicists especially sort of

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.360
use to describe the universe.

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.410
They'll say some theory is
elegant or beautiful.

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:52.390
Or they'll talk about the
importance of symmetry.

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:54.690
And here's a very famous quote
by the Nobel laureate Phil

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.310
Anderson, which is, it's only
slightly overstating the case

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:01.660
that the study of physics is
the study of symmetry.

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:05.930
And yet typically, when you see
physics in high school,

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:07.750
when you see physics in college,
even if you take

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:10.660
advanced courses in graduate
school, it's very

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:13.080
equation-driven.

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.230
The idea of what it is that
underlies our assumptions

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:20.140
about the universe, how it is we
got to where we are, why it

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:24.420
is that physics is sort of held
up as this paragon of a

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.790
beautiful academic discipline,
why is it the universe itself

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:29.910
is so beautiful--

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:34.070
that you don't learn about as
much, until much, much later,

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:35.320
until you delve much,
much deeper.

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:39.960
Indeed, I will say that even
as a practicing physicist,

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.390
until I started working on
this book, I didn't fully

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.720
appreciate how much of what we
know is really undergirded by

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.930
sort of these beautifully
symmetric, simple, in many

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:54.370
cases, assumptions about how
the universe works and how

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:57.370
much can be drawn from that.

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:02.090
So I'm going to begin with a
sort of working definition of

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:03.370
what symmetry is.

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:05.440
This is given by the
mathematician Hermann Weyl,

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:08.520
which is basically, a thing is
symmetric if there's something

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.290
you can do so it stays the same
after you've done it.

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:13.980
A wheel, a circle,
for example--

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.020
I can turn a circle in any given
direction, and it is the

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:20.720
same as it was before.

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.985
Or just another very simple
example, a triangle.

00:02:23.985 --> 00:02:28.020
Now a triangle isn't quite as
symmetric as a circle is,

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.310
because there's only a couple
of things you can do.

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:34.260
You can rotate a triangle, but
only by a specified amount.

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.950
Only by 120 degrees,
a third of a turn.

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.130
Or you can reflect.

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:41.400
I'm drawing it as a rotation
on the bottom there-- or

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.790
rather, my great Illustrator,
Herb Thornby, who did all of

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.230
these, is drawing it
is as a rotation.

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:48.170
But it's really a reflection.

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:50.280
We're just taking the
triangle and we're

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:51.760
looking at it in a mirror.

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.700
And you know, we can talk about
geometric objects till

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.140
the cows come home,
and say, yes, they

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:59.190
are, of course, beautiful.

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.720
There is something very nice,
pleasing about it.

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.250
For those of us who simply
enjoy puzzles, there's

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:05.790
something appealing
to the human mind.

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:11.400
And I've just picked a few very
natural examples here of

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.150
symmetric objects in nature,
symmetric objects in art.

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:19.960
The Taj Mahal, for example.

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:22.210
Architecture, flowers.

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:24.130
We've got an MC Escher print.

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:27.170
There's the galaxy M81
in the lower right.

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:30.240
And for those of you who don't
do these sorts of things, I

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:32.890
occasionally compete in the
National Crossword Puzzle

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:34.950
Tournament here in New York.

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:40.440
Crossword puzzles obey, in the
US at least, a asymmetry where

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:44.670
you can either rotate by 180
degrees or reflect them, and

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:47.140
that's the rule for how the
black squares need to show up.

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:50.470
If you've ever noticed, the
grids for crossword puzzles

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:52.200
look also symmetric.

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.000
And these things appeal
to our mind.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.100
I mean, nature seems
to enjoy symmetry.

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:03.100
But symmetry itself seems to
appeal to our mind and our

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:04.350
sense of order.

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:09.790
It also shows up in scientific
discoveries.

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:12.815
So when Rosalind Franklin, for
example, took her images of

00:04:12.815 --> 00:04:17.240
the double helix, the fact that
DNA had this structure

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:21.000
allowed Watson and Crick-- well,
to uncover that it was a

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:21.519
double helix.

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:24.630
But also to start understanding
what the

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:26.260
workings of DNA were.

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:29.700
I mean, the double helix of
DNA is, of course, one of

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:33.980
these great natural symmetric
objects, insofar as you can

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:36.760
take this thing and twist it,
and it will look the same as

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:38.000
it did before.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.270
But it's worth noting--

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:41.750
and double helix
is particularly

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:43.090
interesting in this way--

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:46.140
that it spirals in a particular
direction.

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:47.330
It's got one symmetry--

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:49.700
that is to say, I can twist
it as much as I like.

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:53.090
But if I were to look at a
double helix in a mirror, you

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:53.970
could tell it was wrong.

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:55.700
You could tell it did
not come from living

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:56.600
being here on Earth.

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:59.020
It would have the wrong
orientation.

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:01.480
So one of the things that's
going to be very interesting

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:04.230
for us about sort of
understanding symmetries in

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:07.470
the universe is to recognize,
symmetries are very beautiful.

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:08.670
They're going to give
us guidance.

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:10.590
They're going to help us
understand how things work.

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:12.170
But there's a symmetry
breaking here, or an

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:17.250
asymmetry, that's going to, in
some sense, give us even more

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:18.360
information.

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:22.060
That's going to allow for, it'll
turn out, nothing less

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:24.830
than our existence.

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:27.750
So all will recognize these.

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:32.090
I bet no small number of you
will recognize these from a

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:37.330
game-playing context of a
name-brand role-playing game.

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:40.100
You also, by the way, notice
that there is one missing.

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:41.600
These are the Platonic solids.

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:44.940
They are also applying
to "D&amp;D" dice.

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:50.850
The missing one, of course, is
the D10, which is not in fact

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:51.670
a Platonic solid.

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:56.610
It is known as an antidypyramid
and has the

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:59.890
beautiful name "Bimbo's
lozenge," and doesn't have

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:00.390
these properties.

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:03.870
But the Platonic solids all
have wonderfully symmetric

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:04.630
properties.

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:09.430
And many, many thinkers, in
trying to uncover sort of the

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:11.970
secrets of nature, assume
that the Platonic

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:13.820
solids and the sphere--

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:16.500
which is basically the Platonic
solid with an

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:19.920
infinite number of faces--

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:24.180
that the Platonic solids must
ultimately give some sort of

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:26.735
clue as to how the
universe works.

00:06:26.735 --> 00:06:29.650
I mean, the sphere, of course,
is the most obvious.

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:33.410
The sphere prompted Aristotle,
for example.

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:35.760
He assumed that because the
sphere is this perfectly

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:38.070
symmetric thing that it
must describe nature.

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:42.630
We owe, ultimately, to him and
his contemporaries the idea of

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:44.890
the celestial sphere, the idea
that the Earth is at the

00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:47.920
center of the universe,
that the orbits

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:50.190
of the various planets--

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:53.160
and the sun, for that matter--
are embedded in spheres around

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:55.760
us, and that the stars
are at the most

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:57.060
distant sphere of all.

00:06:57.060 --> 00:07:00.900
And that must somehow, because
of it's beautiful simplicity,

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:04.240
that that must somehow be a
representation of nature.

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:06.680
Now the spheres were wrong,
in a lot of ways--

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:12.820
not least of which, the Earth
is not at the center of the

00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:15.010
solar system.

00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:16.980
The sun is.

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:18.240
But there are other
reasons, as well.

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:20.960
I mean, even if you accept that
the sun is at the center

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:23.690
of the solar system, something
that I'm hoping you will

00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:27.770
accept, we are still left with
the fact that even the orbits

00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:30.720
of planets are not perfectly
circular, obviously not

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:32.690
perfectly spherical.

00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:34.900
They're elliptical, and it turns
out there's going to be

00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:39.280
a deeper explanation for that.

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:42.280
Even as we moved forward, even
when thinkers started to

00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:45.290
recognize that the sun was at
the center, they still tried

00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:50.710
to exploit a lot of these
wonderfully symmetric figures

00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:52.230
in order to describe
the universe.

00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:54.650
This is Kepler's awesomely-named
"Mysterium

00:07:54.650 --> 00:07:57.710
Cosmographicum." And basically,
what he did is he

00:07:57.710 --> 00:08:00.730
took the various Platonic
solids and the sphere--

00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:03.210
so there were five Platonic
solids, the

00:08:03.210 --> 00:08:04.710
sphere gives us six--

00:08:04.710 --> 00:08:09.870
and there were six planets then
known, out to Saturn.

00:08:09.870 --> 00:08:14.810
And he said, oh, you know, six
Platonic solids including the

00:08:14.810 --> 00:08:17.470
sphere, six planets--

00:08:17.470 --> 00:08:18.650
maybe they're related somehow.

00:08:18.650 --> 00:08:22.490
And he kept embedding them
in this turducken of a

00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:28.230
cosmological model to try to
figure out-- he said, if you

00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:30.310
embed the one in the other, in
the other, in the other, they

00:08:30.310 --> 00:08:32.030
represent, basically,
distances.

00:08:32.030 --> 00:08:35.630
And those might represent the
relative distances of the

00:08:35.630 --> 00:08:37.580
planets from the sun.

00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:39.169
And there might be something
profound and

00:08:39.169 --> 00:08:41.230
fundamental about that.

00:08:41.230 --> 00:08:44.290
It turns out, obviously, that
any match you have to this is

00:08:44.290 --> 00:08:45.600
entirely coincidental.

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:48.500
Coincidental plus the fact, you
know, if you mix and match

00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:51.580
them in any given way, you have

00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:55.010
6-factorial possible orderings.

00:08:55.010 --> 00:08:57.840
You're going to get close with
one of them, presumably.

00:08:57.840 --> 00:08:59.380
But that was sheer luck.

00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:03.510
We owe, of course, to Kepler,
we owe our knowledge of the

00:09:03.510 --> 00:09:06.000
fact that the planets move
in elliptical orbits.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:11.250
Ellipses, at first glance, do
not seem terribly symmetric.

00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:12.230
It will turn out--

00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:16.690
and we ow this to Isaac Newton--
that sure, the orbits

00:09:16.690 --> 00:09:19.120
themselves aren't elliptical,
but the force of gravity is.

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:22.180
The force of gravity acts the
same in all directions.

00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:26.170
And that is a very, very
important symmetry of nature.

00:09:26.170 --> 00:09:29.460
I should note, by the way,
that the only reason that

00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:33.850
Kepler did not immediately hit
upon the idea of planets going

00:09:33.850 --> 00:09:36.910
in elliptical orbits, despite
the data that he got from his

00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:41.900
mentor, Tycho Brahe, was he just
assumed that-- he didn't

00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:43.270
even try it.

00:09:43.270 --> 00:09:45.440
Because he figured if the orbits
of the plants were

00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:48.130
something as simple as an
ellipse, surely someone would

00:09:48.130 --> 00:09:50.080
have come up with it already.

00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:51.860
I think it's giving his
predecessors a little bit too

00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:53.110
much credit, perhaps.

00:09:55.600 --> 00:10:00.250
So it is interesting to note
that when we talk about

00:10:00.250 --> 00:10:04.730
symmetries in the universe, what
we really mean is, what

00:10:04.730 --> 00:10:06.720
are some ways that
you could adjust,

00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:09.150
say, the entire universe--

00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:12.540
turning the universe, for
example, or moving forward or

00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:16.240
backwards in time, or moving
throughout space--

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:19.320
and the laws themselves
don't change?

00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:23.250
So the laws of physics are the
same here as they are here.

00:10:23.250 --> 00:10:25.270
And the only reason anything
appears to be different is

00:10:25.270 --> 00:10:27.880
because of my relative motion,
say, compared to all of you.

00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:32.460
Or if I were to go 1,000 miles
up in the air, things are

00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:34.390
different because of my relative
position to the

00:10:34.390 --> 00:10:36.540
Earth, but not because anything
fundamental about the

00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:38.135
laws of physics have changed.

00:10:38.135 --> 00:10:40.400
So the laws of physics basically
say that all of

00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:42.150
these things-- time,
orientation,

00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:43.220
positions in space--

00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:46.720
none of those matter in
the physical law.

00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:48.240
Now that actually is
incredibly helpful.

00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:50.980
That's way more helpful than you
might think, simply saying

00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:52.900
the laws of physics can't
be dependent on

00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:54.400
any of those things.

00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:58.790
It means, for example, that if
you were to describe a giant

00:10:58.790 --> 00:11:01.390
equation that describes all of
the physics of the universe,

00:11:01.390 --> 00:11:05.550
where you are in it can't ever
appear in that equation.

00:11:05.550 --> 00:11:08.190
Or when it is can't ever appear
in that equation.

00:11:08.190 --> 00:11:11.030
Or there can't be any equation
that ever describes things

00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:12.640
with an absolute direction.

00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:13.290
Won't ever appear.

00:11:13.290 --> 00:11:16.840
That makes the equations
a lot simpler than

00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:19.190
they would be otherwise.

00:11:19.190 --> 00:11:22.790
Those things turn out not to
matter in our symmetries of

00:11:22.790 --> 00:11:23.360
our universe.

00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:26.280
Other things seem like
they might matter

00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:28.310
or might not matter.

00:11:28.310 --> 00:11:29.750
One of them is physical scale.

00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:33.080
And this is a trope of sort of
science-fiction and children's

00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:34.090
books and things like that.

00:11:34.090 --> 00:11:36.200
You know, "Horton Hears a Who,"
or the end of "Men in

00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:37.070
Black."

00:11:37.070 --> 00:11:39.480
The idea that you can
take our universe--

00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:41.040
you know, we're this
giant universe.

00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:42.290
We have these things
called atoms.

00:11:42.290 --> 00:11:44.950
And if you look at the old
models of atoms, atoms look a

00:11:44.950 --> 00:11:47.440
little bit like a sun with
things orbiting around it.

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:52.730
And you can imagine thinking of
that and saying, oh, maybe

00:11:52.730 --> 00:11:56.950
you could be a tiny little
creature living inside of

00:11:56.950 --> 00:12:00.970
that, with a life very much like
a human being's, except

00:12:00.970 --> 00:12:02.670
much, much, much smaller.

00:12:02.670 --> 00:12:06.400
Maybe the universe, on various
scales, is almost identically

00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:09.340
the same as it is on
the human scale.

00:12:09.340 --> 00:12:12.055
And we're just not able to see
it, because our perception

00:12:12.055 --> 00:12:13.210
isn't good enough.

00:12:13.210 --> 00:12:16.270
And you know, this is the sort
of question you have very,

00:12:16.270 --> 00:12:20.180
very late at night in
your dorm rooms.

00:12:20.180 --> 00:12:22.650
I think I'd be prudent, as this
is going to go on the

00:12:22.650 --> 00:12:24.430
web, to not go any further.

00:12:24.430 --> 00:12:26.600
But you get the point.

00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:29.310
This is something we
might think of as a

00:12:29.310 --> 00:12:30.030
property of the universe.

00:12:30.030 --> 00:12:33.180
The question is, does physical
scale matter?

00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:36.290
Well, one of the great thinkers
on the subject was

00:12:36.290 --> 00:12:40.610
Galileo, who decided to ask
the question in sort of an

00:12:40.610 --> 00:12:44.140
absurd way, which is to think
about the existence of giants.

00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:45.960
So there are biblical
descriptions

00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:47.460
of the ages of giants.

00:12:47.460 --> 00:12:50.360
And if we imagine a giant as
merely looking like a normal

00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:54.580
human being, except scaled up
by a factor of 10 or 20 or

00:12:54.580 --> 00:12:55.430
however much--

00:12:55.430 --> 00:12:59.270
this is the same premises in
"Gulliver's Travels"--

00:12:59.270 --> 00:13:03.420
would you be able to do that
without re-engineering the

00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:04.890
entire thing?

00:13:04.890 --> 00:13:06.600
And Galileo says no.

00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:11.480
If you were to simply scale up
a human to giant size, you'd

00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:12.445
have all sorts of problems.

00:13:12.445 --> 00:13:15.540
I mean, after all, if I make you
10 times bigger in every

00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:18.950
direction, you become 1,000
times more massive, 1,000

00:13:18.950 --> 00:13:21.780
times more weight to support,
for example.

00:13:21.780 --> 00:13:25.070
But the strength of your
bones are based on the

00:13:25.070 --> 00:13:26.320
cross-sectional area.

00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:28.850
So if I make you 10 times larger
in every direction,

00:13:28.850 --> 00:13:32.190
your bones only become
100 times stronger.

00:13:32.190 --> 00:13:36.300
You're supporting more weight
per unit area, basically, the

00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:38.150
larger you are.

00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:40.380
And so he said, look, you'd
basically have to totally

00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:44.890
redesign the bone of a giant
until eventually, the thing

00:13:44.890 --> 00:13:48.630
was entirely bones, and the
bones were incredibly,

00:13:48.630 --> 00:13:50.550
incredibly thick, and the thing
wouldn't be able to

00:13:50.550 --> 00:13:51.480
function at all.

00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:52.660
And of course, the
opposite is true.

00:13:52.660 --> 00:13:56.620
I mean, insects don't require
the internal skeletal

00:13:56.620 --> 00:13:57.550
structure that we have.

00:13:57.550 --> 00:14:00.760
They're of an entirely different
design, simply

00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:04.770
because again, this is not
a symmetry of nature.

00:14:04.770 --> 00:14:08.380
Which is again, like,
"Spiderman" is not such a

00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:10.950
great premise.

00:14:10.950 --> 00:14:15.350
Take a spider, scale him
up to human size, and

00:14:15.350 --> 00:14:16.600
he'll squash himself.

00:14:18.610 --> 00:14:25.730
I can't skip this adorable
quote by Galileo.

00:14:25.730 --> 00:14:28.440
He talks about an oak tree.

00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:31.730
You know, "Nature could not
produce a horse as large as

00:14:31.730 --> 00:14:34.130
twenty ordinary horses or a
giant ten times taller than an

00:14:34.130 --> 00:14:36.470
ordinary man."

00:14:36.470 --> 00:14:40.040
And then he concludes with this
adorable imagery, which

00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:43.490
unfortunately does not carry
with it an illustration.

00:14:43.490 --> 00:14:46.270
Galileo's work is filled with
illustrations, but this isn't

00:14:46.270 --> 00:14:47.080
one of them.

00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:49.500
"Thus, a small dog could
probably carry on his back two

00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:52.410
or three dogs of his own size,
but I don't believe that a

00:14:52.410 --> 00:14:55.840
horse could even carry one
horse of his own size." I

00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:57.850
choose to believe that
this experiment was

00:14:57.850 --> 00:14:59.100
never carried out.

00:15:01.510 --> 00:15:07.100
So some things are symmetries,
some things aren't.

00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:10.090
But what about-- we have a human
intuition about what

00:15:10.090 --> 00:15:12.210
should be a symmetry
of nature.

00:15:12.210 --> 00:15:14.290
Antimatter is a very,
very important one.

00:15:14.290 --> 00:15:16.280
We see antimatter in
science-fiction all the time.

00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:18.100
We're able to produce
antimatter in a lab.

00:15:18.100 --> 00:15:21.860
And if you know absolutely one
thing, only one thing about

00:15:21.860 --> 00:15:23.890
antimatter, it's this--

00:15:23.890 --> 00:15:25.630
if you have an antimatter
friend, do

00:15:25.630 --> 00:15:26.940
not shake their hand.

00:15:26.940 --> 00:15:27.900
Why?

00:15:27.900 --> 00:15:28.780
Boom.

00:15:28.780 --> 00:15:30.500
You will be completely
annihilated and

00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:32.110
converted into energy.

00:15:32.110 --> 00:15:34.160
But antimatter really
very much the

00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:35.340
same as ordinary matter.

00:15:35.340 --> 00:15:38.120
There's an antimatter version
of every particle.

00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:40.910
An electron, for example, has an
antimatter particle called

00:15:40.910 --> 00:15:42.050
a positron.

00:15:42.050 --> 00:15:46.340
Same mass, but opposite
electric charge.

00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:49.290
And it is absolutely true that
when you take matter and

00:15:49.290 --> 00:15:51.400
antimatter of the same particle
type and bring them

00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:54.170
into contact, they will
annihilate completely.

00:15:54.170 --> 00:15:59.460
It is also true, by the way,
that if you produce matter and

00:15:59.460 --> 00:16:05.260
antimatter in a lab, that we
are able to produce them in

00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:07.830
equal quantities.

00:16:07.830 --> 00:16:11.070
This raises kind of an important
question, one that

00:16:11.070 --> 00:16:14.530
is not immediately obvious
how to resolve it.

00:16:14.530 --> 00:16:19.090
Given the similarity between
matter and antimatter, given a

00:16:19.090 --> 00:16:21.990
very important fact, which is
that the laws of physics don't

00:16:21.990 --> 00:16:24.250
seem to care whether you're
talking about matter or

00:16:24.250 --> 00:16:28.690
antimatter-- it's just the sign
that changes, and given

00:16:28.690 --> 00:16:30.280
the fact that we produce and
annihilate them in equal

00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:34.760
quantities, why are we here
and made of matter?

00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:37.530
The laws of physics, I should
say, are almost completely

00:16:37.530 --> 00:16:41.145
identical if we take matter and
convert it to antimatter.

00:16:41.145 --> 00:16:44.710
I've got a little silly example
here, where I've done

00:16:44.710 --> 00:16:46.190
two things.

00:16:46.190 --> 00:16:52.360
I've got a current-carrying
wire, electrons.

00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:54.500
Electrons have a negative
charge, so they go the

00:16:54.500 --> 00:16:56.960
opposite direction of
the flow of current.

00:16:56.960 --> 00:16:57.950
We owe that convention,

00:16:57.950 --> 00:17:00.300
incidentally to Benjamin Franklin.

00:17:00.300 --> 00:17:02.670
And it creates a
magnetic field.

00:17:02.670 --> 00:17:07.430
And likewise, if we look at the
same thing in a mirror and

00:17:07.430 --> 00:17:10.270
also change all of the matter
to antimatter, we get the

00:17:10.270 --> 00:17:11.790
exact same magnetic field.

00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:20.270
There's something intimately
related to mirrors and to

00:17:20.270 --> 00:17:21.310
antimatter.

00:17:21.310 --> 00:17:25.089
And those two combinations of
things, called CP symmetry--

00:17:25.089 --> 00:17:28.600
Charge for antimatter and P
for parity or reflection--

00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:32.770
that seems to almost be
a asymmetry of nature.

00:17:32.770 --> 00:17:33.300
Almost.

00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:36.040
I mean, clearly, as I've said,
it can't be a perfect symmetry

00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:38.120
of nature, because there is
something different between

00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:40.130
matter and antimatter.

00:17:40.130 --> 00:17:41.200
And by the way, it's
not just us.

00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:43.020
It's not just that we are all
made of matter, and the Earth,

00:17:43.020 --> 00:17:44.780
and sun, and the solar system,
and our galaxy--

00:17:44.780 --> 00:17:48.150
every galaxy seems to be made
ordinary matter and not

00:17:48.150 --> 00:17:48.660
antimatter.

00:17:48.660 --> 00:17:51.710
And we can tell that, because if
a galaxy and an anti-galaxy

00:17:51.710 --> 00:17:54.910
were to collide with one
another, we would see that

00:17:54.910 --> 00:17:56.180
across space.

00:17:56.180 --> 00:17:58.670
And if there were antimatter
galaxies, it would happen

00:17:58.670 --> 00:17:59.480
occasionally.

00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:01.600
And we do see galaxies
colliding, by the way, and

00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:04.390
they just have the regular sort
of gastrophysics that

00:18:04.390 --> 00:18:05.640
you'd expect.

00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:12.400
There's only the simplest
difference between even the

00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:18.560
reflected version of this CP
transformation between matter

00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:22.220
and antimatter, and that is that
we can see little things.

00:18:22.220 --> 00:18:25.290
For example, this is the
cobalt-60 decay.

00:18:25.290 --> 00:18:29.440
So you take cobalt-60, and
atoms have this property

00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:31.590
called spin, which is, in
principle, directly

00:18:31.590 --> 00:18:32.600
measurable.

00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:36.820
And it turns out that the
ordinary matter version has

00:18:36.820 --> 00:18:40.200
electrons preferentially given
off in the direction that the

00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:41.460
thing is spinning.

00:18:41.460 --> 00:18:44.130
So you use this thing called
the right-hand rule, and

00:18:44.130 --> 00:18:49.050
preferentially, electrons are
ejected more in the direction

00:18:49.050 --> 00:18:51.290
of the spin than opposite the
direction of the spin.

00:18:51.290 --> 00:18:55.890
We've got little hints like
this, that there are slight

00:18:55.890 --> 00:18:58.320
violations of symmetry in
nature, but we don't know

00:18:58.320 --> 00:19:00.000
where they come from.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:03.120
And they only show up in what
is known as the weak force.

00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:05.250
The laws of physics are broken
down into sort of four

00:19:05.250 --> 00:19:06.530
fundamental forces--

00:19:06.530 --> 00:19:09.210
gravity, electromagnetism,
and the strong and

00:19:09.210 --> 00:19:10.640
weak nuclear force.

00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:13.660
And every one of them, except
for the weak force, seems to

00:19:13.660 --> 00:19:18.660
not give any concern whatsoever
about the

00:19:18.660 --> 00:19:21.460
distinction between matter
and antimatter.

00:19:21.460 --> 00:19:23.690
It's only the weak force that
shows even the slightest

00:19:23.690 --> 00:19:25.340
preference.

00:19:25.340 --> 00:19:29.730
And that slightest preference
seems to be, in very, very

00:19:29.730 --> 00:19:31.570
subtle ways-- it doesn't even
mean that more matter is

00:19:31.570 --> 00:19:32.760
created than antimatter.

00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:36.360
It's just in what we can do in
a lab, we see very, very tiny

00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:38.320
differences that say, somewhere
in the equation--

00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:39.990
and we can identify
those terms--

00:19:39.990 --> 00:19:42.530
but somewhere in the equations
is a tiny difference.

00:19:42.530 --> 00:19:45.830
The universe knows about the
difference between the two.

00:19:45.830 --> 00:19:47.360
But how did it choose that?

00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:50.360
We don't know.

00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:51.910
Here's just one other sort of

00:19:51.910 --> 00:19:53.240
illustration of the same thing.

00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:55.410
This is just a matter
of a particle

00:19:55.410 --> 00:19:58.190
known as the neutrino.

00:19:58.190 --> 00:20:02.050
A neutrino is a relic, generally
speaking, of weak

00:20:02.050 --> 00:20:03.270
nuclear interactions.

00:20:03.270 --> 00:20:05.240
And one of the things that's
very interesting about a

00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:10.870
neutrino is that if it is
created in a reaction, it

00:20:10.870 --> 00:20:14.440
always flies out in such a way
that it's spinning as given by

00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:16.470
your left hand.

00:20:16.470 --> 00:20:19.140
Anti-neutrinos are always
spinning in a way that would

00:20:19.140 --> 00:20:21.490
be given by your right hand,
with your thumb giving its

00:20:21.490 --> 00:20:22.940
direction of motion.

00:20:22.940 --> 00:20:27.180
And as I was implying, they
look basically the same.

00:20:27.180 --> 00:20:29.500
If you take all anti-neutrinos
and turn them into neutrinos,

00:20:29.500 --> 00:20:32.350
and vice versa, and take
everything and look at it in a

00:20:32.350 --> 00:20:36.520
mirror, which makes the spins
go the opposite way.

00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:39.120
Except that cobalt-60 thing.

00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:45.580
It turns out that we can even
make that difference between

00:20:45.580 --> 00:20:47.980
matter and antimatter go away.

00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:52.970
There's an interesting
discussion, and I've

00:20:52.970 --> 00:20:54.380
excerpted it here.

00:20:54.380 --> 00:20:58.720
But the crux of it is, in his
Nobel Laureate speech, Richard

00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:01.240
Feynman, one of the great
physicists of the 20th

00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:04.600
century, was relating a
conversation that he'd had

00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:07.320
with his advisor, John
Archibald Wheeler.

00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:10.310
And Wheeler had this idea.

00:21:10.310 --> 00:21:13.890
And he had a lot more that went
into it, but the idea

00:21:13.890 --> 00:21:18.430
was, he said, you know, the
physics of positrons looks

00:21:18.430 --> 00:21:21.980
almost exactly the same as the
physics of electrons, if you

00:21:21.980 --> 00:21:24.400
assume that positrons
are electrons going

00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:25.650
backwards in time.

00:21:28.350 --> 00:21:31.200
And it's true.

00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:34.620
And so we ask the question.

00:21:34.620 --> 00:21:35.330
We've got this combination.

00:21:35.330 --> 00:21:37.230
We've got three symmetries that
I've mentioned so far.

00:21:37.230 --> 00:21:41.330
Three symmetries, three very
good approximations to almost

00:21:41.330 --> 00:21:43.350
perfect symmetries in nature.

00:21:43.350 --> 00:21:45.550
Take matter, turn it into
antimatter, look at it in a

00:21:45.550 --> 00:21:47.520
mirror, and reverse
it in time.

00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:50.490
CPT, it's called.

00:21:50.490 --> 00:21:53.580
And every single reaction in
nature that we've ever

00:21:53.580 --> 00:21:55.080
discovered--

00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:57.130
ever--

00:21:57.130 --> 00:21:59.010
will work totally the
same if you do those

00:21:59.010 --> 00:22:03.520
three reversals, basically.

00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:04.160
Incredible.

00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:05.230
Surprising.

00:22:05.230 --> 00:22:07.650
And also very, very weird,
when you think about it.

00:22:07.650 --> 00:22:10.700
Because when you think about
what that third one is, that

00:22:10.700 --> 00:22:12.810
third one, time reversal--

00:22:12.810 --> 00:22:17.220
time reversal seems like it is
hardwired into our laws of

00:22:17.220 --> 00:22:18.040
physics, right?

00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:20.060
Time reversal should
not be an even

00:22:20.060 --> 00:22:23.220
approximate symmetry of nature.

00:22:23.220 --> 00:22:27.030
I mean after all, you don't know
how this talk is going to

00:22:27.030 --> 00:22:29.640
end, but you do know
hot it started.

00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:30.790
You remember the past.

00:22:30.790 --> 00:22:32.890
You do not remember
the future.

00:22:32.890 --> 00:22:34.400
There's a thing called
cause and effect.

00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:35.190
I could go on and on.

00:22:35.190 --> 00:22:39.560
I mean, we almost don't have the
words to explain how weird

00:22:39.560 --> 00:22:42.650
it is that there is such a thing
as the arrow of time.

00:22:42.650 --> 00:22:46.210
And yet there is an
arrow of time.

00:22:46.210 --> 00:22:49.820
But that said, if you look at
microscopic interactions--

00:22:49.820 --> 00:22:52.770
and after all, what are
macroscopic interactions, but

00:22:52.770 --> 00:22:55.050
a collection of microscopic
interactions?

00:22:55.050 --> 00:22:57.750
A big collection.

00:22:57.750 --> 00:23:00.100
You look at these things, and
you can reverse them in time.

00:23:00.100 --> 00:23:04.200
This is my time mirror that
I had my illustrator draw.

00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:07.150
You take a movie of, say, two
electrons scattering off of

00:23:07.150 --> 00:23:10.700
one another and look at that
scatter in a mirror.

00:23:10.700 --> 00:23:12.810
That process looks
equally valid.

00:23:12.810 --> 00:23:14.890
I take a ball, I throw it though
the air-- well, I throw

00:23:14.890 --> 00:23:16.140
it a little bit more
professionally.

00:23:16.140 --> 00:23:18.630
I throw a ball through the
air, it makes an arc.

00:23:18.630 --> 00:23:21.180
I take a movie of it, watch
that arc in reverse.

00:23:21.180 --> 00:23:23.260
It also looks like a valid
trajectory that

00:23:23.260 --> 00:23:24.510
a ball could make.

00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:29.690
The laws of physics seem
perfectly comfortable being

00:23:29.690 --> 00:23:32.310
run forward or reversed.

00:23:32.310 --> 00:23:35.780
But obviously there is
a complication--

00:23:35.780 --> 00:23:38.480
one that shows up in a fairly
complicated way.

00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:41.700
And that is with the
idea of entropy.

00:23:41.700 --> 00:23:44.290
So entropy's one of these words
that's thrown around.

00:23:44.290 --> 00:23:47.600
It's generally considered
to be--

00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:50.665
we talk about it as something
like disorder, for example.

00:23:50.665 --> 00:23:54.060
But entropy, we think about
entropy with gas molecules,

00:23:54.060 --> 00:23:56.690
for example, and entropy, to a
physicist, is really just a

00:23:56.690 --> 00:23:59.640
measure of possibilities.

00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:04.500
So what we've got here is
a little cartoon of gas

00:24:04.500 --> 00:24:06.570
molecules in a box.

00:24:06.570 --> 00:24:09.730
And we've got the same number
of molecules in both

00:24:09.730 --> 00:24:13.930
illustrations, 10,
jumping around.

00:24:13.930 --> 00:24:20.380
In the left box, we've got
almost all of the gas

00:24:20.380 --> 00:24:22.625
molecules in the right
partition.

00:24:22.625 --> 00:24:24.460
Now there's very, very
few ways to do that.

00:24:24.460 --> 00:24:27.140
If I were to number all my
atoms, for example, there's

00:24:27.140 --> 00:24:31.130
only 10 different atoms that
can be the sole atom in the

00:24:31.130 --> 00:24:33.480
left partition.

00:24:33.480 --> 00:24:36.620
This is what's called low
entropy, or very high order.

00:24:36.620 --> 00:24:38.500
In other words, it's like
putting away your room.

00:24:38.500 --> 00:24:41.760
I mean, there's a lot of
empty space once you've

00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:43.500
cleaned up your room.

00:24:43.500 --> 00:24:45.480
On the other hand, in the right
box, we've got this

00:24:45.480 --> 00:24:47.870
thing called high entropy And
high entropy is basically,

00:24:47.870 --> 00:24:49.676
everything is much more
uniformly distributed.

00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:55.520
I cannot stress this strongly
enough, because this is a very

00:24:55.520 --> 00:24:59.200
popular misconception, even when
people have encountered

00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:02.230
thermodynamics in high
school and college.

00:25:02.230 --> 00:25:05.350
But going from low entropy to
high entropy, something that

00:25:05.350 --> 00:25:09.760
is so well-established that it
is known as the second law of

00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:13.740
thermodynamics, is not
really a law at all.

00:25:13.740 --> 00:25:18.600
It's merely a very, very
good suggestion.

00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:21.850
More or less even distributions
like this right

00:25:21.850 --> 00:25:25.010
image are just far more likely,
because there's far

00:25:25.010 --> 00:25:27.960
more ways to distribute your
air molecules than

00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:29.700
the ones on the left.

00:25:29.700 --> 00:25:32.620
It is absolutely possible--

00:25:32.620 --> 00:25:34.690
possible, within the
realm of physics--

00:25:34.690 --> 00:25:38.890
that spontaneously, all of the
air molecules on that side of

00:25:38.890 --> 00:25:42.620
the room migrate for some short
period of time over to

00:25:42.620 --> 00:25:43.710
that side of the room.

00:25:43.710 --> 00:25:47.440
And all of you asphyxiate, and
all of you, I guess, get

00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:48.980
crushed from air pressure?

00:25:48.980 --> 00:25:50.100
We could probably survive.

00:25:50.100 --> 00:25:52.080
We could probably survive
two atmospheres.

00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:53.230
I think you guys are
gonna be fine.

00:25:53.230 --> 00:25:54.520
I'm sorry to you.

00:25:54.520 --> 00:25:58.490
But it's incredibly unlikely
that that would happen.

00:25:58.490 --> 00:26:01.510
But possible.

00:26:01.510 --> 00:26:04.970
That said, this is our biggest
clue as to how the arrow of

00:26:04.970 --> 00:26:06.310
time works.

00:26:06.310 --> 00:26:11.710
The idea that things go from low
entropy/high order to high

00:26:11.710 --> 00:26:15.092
entropy/high disorder.

00:26:15.092 --> 00:26:18.710
It is within the realm of
physics that if I break a set

00:26:18.710 --> 00:26:22.010
of cue balls, a racked set of
cue balls, that they're going

00:26:22.010 --> 00:26:22.790
to scatter around.

00:26:22.790 --> 00:26:25.300
If I hit a ball in just the
right way, that they might

00:26:25.300 --> 00:26:28.600
reassemble into a triangle.

00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:30.280
I would not try to
make that shot.

00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:33.590
It would be almost vanishingly
difficult to do so.

00:26:33.590 --> 00:26:35.460
But it is within the
realm of physics.

00:26:35.460 --> 00:26:39.650
It's just there's not that many
ways that a set of balls

00:26:39.650 --> 00:26:42.090
can be arrayed in a triangle.

00:26:42.090 --> 00:26:43.060
It's extremely difficult.

00:26:43.060 --> 00:26:45.130
It's extremely unlikely.

00:26:45.130 --> 00:26:48.140
So the increase in entropy is
a probabilistic statement of

00:26:48.140 --> 00:26:48.580
the universe.

00:26:48.580 --> 00:26:50.950
It's just there's so many
particles out there that those

00:26:50.950 --> 00:26:55.070
probabilities become
almost certainties.

00:26:55.070 --> 00:26:59.080
There are even games
that people play--

00:26:59.080 --> 00:26:59.980
yeah, I like that.

00:26:59.980 --> 00:27:02.340
This is one of my favorites.

00:27:02.340 --> 00:27:05.220
There are even games that people
play to try to see

00:27:05.220 --> 00:27:08.430
whether the second law of
thermodynamics can be toyed

00:27:08.430 --> 00:27:10.670
with, not just in a
probabilistic sense, but if we

00:27:10.670 --> 00:27:11.680
might be able to do this.

00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:14.420
This is something known as
Maxwell's demon, the idea that

00:27:14.420 --> 00:27:18.390
we might be able to make a low
entropy and a high entropy--

00:27:18.390 --> 00:27:21.890
make a low-entropy system merely
by having a robot or

00:27:21.890 --> 00:27:26.570
some other brain open a box
and let particles through

00:27:26.570 --> 00:27:28.100
depending on the nature
of those particles.

00:27:28.100 --> 00:27:30.780
So in this case, we might
imagine Maxwell's demon takes

00:27:30.780 --> 00:27:36.060
the high-energy particles and
tries to sort them to the left

00:27:36.060 --> 00:27:37.950
side of the partition
and the low-energy

00:27:37.950 --> 00:27:39.720
particles into the right.

00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:43.690
This would be a zero-energy way
of basically creating a

00:27:43.690 --> 00:27:44.530
refrigerator.

00:27:44.530 --> 00:27:47.680
Put all the hot air on one side,
put all the cold air on

00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:49.500
the other, and that
indeed would be

00:27:49.500 --> 00:27:51.740
a decrease in entropy.

00:27:51.740 --> 00:27:55.760
It turns out especially
philosophers of science have

00:27:55.760 --> 00:27:56.700
thought about this.

00:27:56.700 --> 00:28:00.330
And one of the problems with a
scenario like Maxwell's demon

00:28:00.330 --> 00:28:04.290
is that in making these
determinations, it isn't a

00:28:04.290 --> 00:28:05.770
zero increase in entropy.

00:28:05.770 --> 00:28:09.620
You'd basically have to have the
demon itself record, say,

00:28:09.620 --> 00:28:11.870
the speed of the particle in
its brain, and then when it

00:28:11.870 --> 00:28:13.690
made the next measurement, it'd
have to sort of erase

00:28:13.690 --> 00:28:15.600
that measurement and
put it again.

00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:19.510
And that erasure is going to
increase the net entropy of

00:28:19.510 --> 00:28:22.390
the universe.

00:28:22.390 --> 00:28:25.440
So time itself seems
to have an arrow.

00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:31.330
And if you notice that I haven't
actually resolved why

00:28:31.330 --> 00:28:35.260
it is that we have this arrow
of time, you'd be right.

00:28:35.260 --> 00:28:39.930
We do not presently know, we do
not really know, why it is

00:28:39.930 --> 00:28:42.960
that there is the arrow of time
and that it's one way and

00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:43.330
not the other.

00:28:43.330 --> 00:28:49.090
We do not know whether entropy
increases with time, or

00:28:49.090 --> 00:28:53.960
whether entropy is what makes
the arrow of time.

00:28:53.960 --> 00:28:57.290
You know, one of the great
observations that we've made

00:28:57.290 --> 00:29:00.736
about the universe is--

00:29:00.736 --> 00:29:02.530
tempted to see-- ah, yes,
it is a pointer.

00:29:02.530 --> 00:29:05.180
This is the microwave background
of the universe.

00:29:05.180 --> 00:29:08.310
It represents hot points--
those are the reds--

00:29:08.310 --> 00:29:10.270
and cold points in
the universe.

00:29:10.270 --> 00:29:12.290
Hot and cold in this case being

00:29:12.290 --> 00:29:14.340
about one part in 100,000.

00:29:14.340 --> 00:29:16.880
And the very early universe,
the universe was very, very

00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:18.630
ordered, very, very
low entropy.

00:29:18.630 --> 00:29:20.730
This is very, very smooth.

00:29:20.730 --> 00:29:27.140
And so the question is, did the
universe start with low

00:29:27.140 --> 00:29:30.170
entropy, or are we only in a
universe where the arrow of

00:29:30.170 --> 00:29:34.110
time is defined because we
define the past as being

00:29:34.110 --> 00:29:34.700
low-entropy?

00:29:34.700 --> 00:29:36.480
We do not know.

00:29:38.990 --> 00:29:41.340
There are, however,
other symmetries

00:29:41.340 --> 00:29:42.810
that we can look at.

00:29:42.810 --> 00:29:46.150
And in particular, we see that
the universe is largely the

00:29:46.150 --> 00:29:47.380
same in all directions.

00:29:47.380 --> 00:29:49.810
That is a symmetry not just of
the laws of physics itself,

00:29:49.810 --> 00:29:52.670
but of the universe,
apparently.

00:29:52.670 --> 00:29:54.220
We can see that not just in
the distribution of the

00:29:54.220 --> 00:29:56.030
microwave background, but
also over here with the

00:29:56.030 --> 00:29:58.300
distributions of galaxies.

00:29:58.300 --> 00:30:01.380
The question is, what
does this mean?

00:30:01.380 --> 00:30:03.260
What do all of these symmetries
that we've talked

00:30:03.260 --> 00:30:05.070
about, what ultimately
do they mean?

00:30:05.070 --> 00:30:06.890
Many of you could rightly look
at them and be like, yeah,

00:30:06.890 --> 00:30:08.200
that's an interesting
curiosity.

00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:10.520
Yeah, sure, that's great.

00:30:10.520 --> 00:30:13.242
But why?

00:30:13.242 --> 00:30:15.360
Why do they ultimately
matter, apart from

00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:17.430
saying, isn't this beautiful?

00:30:17.430 --> 00:30:19.440
This is, after all-- we're
talking with physics.

00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:20.570
This is not an art museum.

00:30:20.570 --> 00:30:22.540
We can't look at it to be
beautiful just for the sake of

00:30:22.540 --> 00:30:24.490
being beautiful.

00:30:24.490 --> 00:30:27.880
So one of the great
breakthroughs with regards to

00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:32.680
understanding why symmetry is
so important came up with a

00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:37.340
mathematician by the name of
Emmy Noether Mathematicians

00:30:37.340 --> 00:30:39.630
tend to revere her,
by the way.

00:30:39.630 --> 00:30:44.290
But many physicists either
haven't heard of her or

00:30:44.290 --> 00:30:48.650
remember very vaguely hearing
about Noether's theorem in one

00:30:48.650 --> 00:30:51.290
class when they were, say,
a sophomore or junior in

00:30:51.290 --> 00:30:54.250
college, and then they promptly
forgot about her.

00:30:54.250 --> 00:30:57.780
She is, to my mind, one of the
most important mathematicians

00:30:57.780 --> 00:31:00.970
that we haven't really
heard of.

00:31:00.970 --> 00:31:01.960
And I was in the same boat.

00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:05.310
I mean, I'd seen Noether's
theorem and promptly forgotten

00:31:05.310 --> 00:31:07.090
about it, when I saw
it in college.

00:31:07.090 --> 00:31:09.940
And yet she is the foundation,
in many respects, of things

00:31:09.940 --> 00:31:13.280
like supersymmetry and these
grand unified theories, all of

00:31:13.280 --> 00:31:16.230
our understanding of why we have
a fundamentally unified

00:31:16.230 --> 00:31:18.450
theory-- a standard model,
for that matter--

00:31:18.450 --> 00:31:19.920
of particle physics.

00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:22.870
And you know, she's an
interesting case study for

00:31:22.870 --> 00:31:23.420
many reasons.

00:31:23.420 --> 00:31:25.180
I'm going to give you a couple
slides, because I want to

00:31:25.180 --> 00:31:26.730
point this out.

00:31:26.730 --> 00:31:29.180
She has this parallel, in
many ways, to Einstein.

00:31:29.180 --> 00:31:33.980
Einstein very famously toiled in
obscurity in a Swiss patent

00:31:33.980 --> 00:31:36.990
office until his great
breakthroughs, his miracle

00:31:36.990 --> 00:31:39.710
year of 1905.

00:31:39.710 --> 00:31:43.320
Noether had similar, but the
motivations of the problems

00:31:43.320 --> 00:31:46.340
were different, around
the same time.

00:31:46.340 --> 00:31:48.020
She was born in Erlangen.

00:31:48.020 --> 00:31:52.330
Her father was a mathematics
professor.

00:31:52.330 --> 00:31:57.870
And in 1898, 1900, when she was
going to school or would

00:31:57.870 --> 00:32:00.010
have gone to school, they
basically said, no, we can't

00:32:00.010 --> 00:32:00.530
admit women.

00:32:00.530 --> 00:32:04.560
That would overthrow
all academic order.

00:32:04.560 --> 00:32:07.200
So she audited all
her classes.

00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:09.900
She was-- you know, one of these
cyber-schools that we'd

00:32:09.900 --> 00:32:12.110
now have, I guess.

00:32:12.110 --> 00:32:14.770
And she basically went in just
to take her final exams in

00:32:14.770 --> 00:32:15.300
Nuremberg--

00:32:15.300 --> 00:32:17.220
which she, of course, aced.

00:32:17.220 --> 00:32:21.120
She pursued her Ph.D.
Eventually, of course, this

00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:22.770
restriction on women
was lifted.

00:32:22.770 --> 00:32:25.150
She got her Ph.D. at Erlangen.

00:32:25.150 --> 00:32:26.320
And she wasn't able
to get a position.

00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:29.840
She stayed at home, basically,
writing important mathematics

00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:32.330
papers, occasionally
substitute-teaching for her

00:32:32.330 --> 00:32:34.580
father, and that was it--

00:32:34.580 --> 00:32:37.210
until Einstein came up with
his theory of general

00:32:37.210 --> 00:32:38.940
relativity.

00:32:38.940 --> 00:32:42.060
So 1915, he came up his theory
of general relativity.

00:32:42.060 --> 00:32:44.300
Everyone recognized the
importance of it almost

00:32:44.300 --> 00:32:45.290
immediately.

00:32:45.290 --> 00:32:49.110
And Noether was invited by David
Hilbert and Klein to go

00:32:49.110 --> 00:32:52.140
to Gottingen to explain it.

00:32:52.140 --> 00:32:53.520
They said, basically,
I'm sorry, the

00:32:53.520 --> 00:32:54.965
university won't pay you.

00:32:54.965 --> 00:32:59.070
I mean, Hilbert was this
incredible advocate for her,

00:32:59.070 --> 00:33:02.460
but he was very unsuccessful
for a very, very long time.

00:33:02.460 --> 00:33:04.170
But she went.

00:33:04.170 --> 00:33:08.400
She went, and almost immediately
created this

00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:10.420
wonderful work which is known
as Noether's theorem, which

00:33:10.420 --> 00:33:12.190
I'm going to relate to
you in just a moment.

00:33:12.190 --> 00:33:15.320
But again, it's worth relating
a little bit more her story.

00:33:15.320 --> 00:33:16.110
Hilbert--

00:33:16.110 --> 00:33:16.720
there's a quote here.

00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:18.550
You know, "I don't see the sex
of a candidate as an argument

00:33:18.550 --> 00:33:21.690
against her admission as
a Privatdozent." That's

00:33:21.690 --> 00:33:23.710
basically an associate
professor.

00:33:23.710 --> 00:33:27.940
"After all, we're a university,
not a bathhouse."

00:33:27.940 --> 00:33:31.660
She developed her theorem, and
it wasn't for another seven,

00:33:31.660 --> 00:33:34.500
eight years that she was able
to get any sort of paycheck,

00:33:34.500 --> 00:33:36.770
incredibly tiny amount-- by the
way, not just because she

00:33:36.770 --> 00:33:42.970
was a woman, but also because
she was a pacifist and a Jew

00:33:42.970 --> 00:33:46.750
and a socialist, as
I understand it.

00:33:46.750 --> 00:33:50.140
1933, Nazis come to power and
she goes to Bryn Mawr College,

00:33:50.140 --> 00:33:53.730
and sadly, about 18 months
later, passed away due to

00:33:53.730 --> 00:33:57.215
complications from
cancer surgery.

00:33:59.770 --> 00:34:04.380
And here's this wonderful
comment by Einstein.

00:34:04.380 --> 00:34:07.080
"The most competent living
mathematicians, Noether was

00:34:07.080 --> 00:34:09.100
the most significant creative
mathematical genius thus far

00:34:09.100 --> 00:34:11.480
produced since the education of
women began." And I mean,

00:34:11.480 --> 00:34:12.110
that's understanding it.

00:34:12.110 --> 00:34:14.250
I mean, not just amongst women,
but among men, as well.

00:34:14.250 --> 00:34:17.370
She was an incredible
mathematician.

00:34:17.370 --> 00:34:18.580
So what is it she told us?

00:34:18.580 --> 00:34:20.070
What is it she said?

00:34:20.070 --> 00:34:23.139
I mean, Noether's theorem, in
words, sounds very, very--

00:34:23.139 --> 00:34:24.110
it sounds pithy.

00:34:24.110 --> 00:34:27.020
It almost sounds content-free.

00:34:27.020 --> 00:34:29.510
But it says that every one of
these symmetries that we've

00:34:29.510 --> 00:34:32.480
been talking about produces
a conserved quantity.

00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:34.969
And conserved quantities, I will
say, to physics is the

00:34:34.969 --> 00:34:36.780
bread and butter of
the universe.

00:34:36.780 --> 00:34:39.000
We hear about things like
conservation of energy.

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:41.300
Conservation of energy is
incredibly useful because it

00:34:41.300 --> 00:34:44.380
says, look, if you start off
with an energy budget, if you

00:34:44.380 --> 00:34:48.409
start off with the sun, and the
sun does something, the

00:34:48.409 --> 00:34:51.540
energy of the sun needs
to go somewhere.

00:34:51.540 --> 00:34:54.510
Either it heats the Earth, or
it's converted into mass, or

00:34:54.510 --> 00:34:57.190
whatever it may be--

00:34:57.190 --> 00:35:00.450
the universe will contain a
constant amount of energy, or

00:35:00.450 --> 00:35:03.760
electric charge, or
what have you.

00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:06.000
And what Noether said is
all these symmetries--

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:09.340
symmetries give rise to
conserved quantities.

00:35:09.340 --> 00:35:14.220
So for example, what she showed
was the fact that the

00:35:14.220 --> 00:35:17.030
laws of physics are the same
everywhere in the universe

00:35:17.030 --> 00:35:20.420
immediately gives rise to the
conservation of momentum.

00:35:20.420 --> 00:35:21.270
This is a big deal.

00:35:21.270 --> 00:35:22.850
Conservation of momentum,
of course, was known.

00:35:22.850 --> 00:35:24.390
It's Newton's first
law of motion.

00:35:24.390 --> 00:35:26.330
Objects in motion stay in
motion, blah, blah, blah.

00:35:29.030 --> 00:35:30.980
But that was the
starting point.

00:35:30.980 --> 00:35:33.770
What Noether's theorem
essentially did was she pushed

00:35:33.770 --> 00:35:34.530
us back a step.

00:35:34.530 --> 00:35:35.980
She said, no, there's
something even more

00:35:35.980 --> 00:35:37.840
fundamental than that.

00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:40.720
Newton's first law itself is
built on the idea of a

00:35:40.720 --> 00:35:43.450
symmetry, on the fact that
the laws of physics

00:35:43.450 --> 00:35:45.580
are constant in space.

00:35:45.580 --> 00:35:48.230
The fact that the laws of
physics are the same in all

00:35:48.230 --> 00:35:50.060
directions, that there's no
terms that tell you about a

00:35:50.060 --> 00:35:52.610
fixed direction of the universe,
say that there's a

00:35:52.610 --> 00:35:54.680
conservation of angular
momentum.

00:35:54.680 --> 00:35:58.330
The fact that the laws of
physics are constant in time

00:35:58.330 --> 00:36:01.170
immediately gives rise to this
conservation of energy.

00:36:01.170 --> 00:36:03.410
And there's more.

00:36:03.410 --> 00:36:08.110
Now I'm sure some of you may
have pure mathematics

00:36:08.110 --> 00:36:08.720
backgrounds.

00:36:08.720 --> 00:36:13.400
I don't expect you to parse
this, either way.

00:36:13.400 --> 00:36:18.120
I'm only putting this up here
just to mention how important

00:36:18.120 --> 00:36:19.640
this ends up being
in our modern

00:36:19.640 --> 00:36:21.270
understanding of physics.

00:36:21.270 --> 00:36:22.940
Our modern understanding of
physics is all of those

00:36:22.940 --> 00:36:28.210
fundamental forces that we talk
about are fundamentally

00:36:28.210 --> 00:36:30.290
built on symmetries.

00:36:30.290 --> 00:36:33.080
And these symmetries basically
describe how the quantum

00:36:33.080 --> 00:36:41.340
mechanical waves of a system can
be changed without any of

00:36:41.340 --> 00:36:44.010
the underlying quantities
changing and without the

00:36:44.010 --> 00:36:46.370
energies of interaction
changing.

00:36:46.370 --> 00:36:50.200
And it turns out you can
describe, for example, U1.

00:36:50.200 --> 00:36:51.330
I'll just give this
simple example.

00:36:51.330 --> 00:36:52.620
That's the phase of a wave.

00:36:52.620 --> 00:36:56.380
If you can adjust the phase
of a wave without changing

00:36:56.380 --> 00:36:59.060
anything, that's a symmetry.

00:36:59.060 --> 00:36:59.760
And what Noether--

00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:02.390
well, what her successors
ultimately showed is that

00:37:02.390 --> 00:37:05.910
immediately gives rise to all
of Maxwell's equations.

00:37:05.910 --> 00:37:08.260
Absolutely incredible.

00:37:08.260 --> 00:37:09.580
And show that there
are conserved

00:37:09.580 --> 00:37:13.200
quantities like charges.

00:37:13.200 --> 00:37:19.410
And subsequently predicted the
particle that's associated

00:37:19.410 --> 00:37:20.890
with that, which
is the photon.

00:37:20.890 --> 00:37:24.370
In other words, Noether's
theorem is the first of an

00:37:24.370 --> 00:37:26.810
incredibly important
step in showing--

00:37:26.810 --> 00:37:28.720
make this very simple assumption
about the laws

00:37:28.720 --> 00:37:31.020
work, and you get the nature
of the interaction, all the

00:37:31.020 --> 00:37:35.020
equations, and the particle
that relates it.

00:37:35.020 --> 00:37:37.940
Same is true for the weak force,
which produce the W and

00:37:37.940 --> 00:37:41.290
Z particles, and for the strong
force, which created

00:37:41.290 --> 00:37:42.540
the gluons.

00:37:44.420 --> 00:37:45.670
All built on symmetries.

00:37:48.700 --> 00:37:51.500
Even if there those symmetries
themselves don't look elegant,

00:37:51.500 --> 00:37:55.230
putting a little plot of all the
particles in the standard

00:37:55.230 --> 00:37:57.580
model does start to
look symmetric.

00:37:57.580 --> 00:38:00.990
I mean, this does look much more
orderly, where what we've

00:38:00.990 --> 00:38:03.670
got here, ranked from bottom to
top, are the charges of the

00:38:03.670 --> 00:38:04.910
various particles.

00:38:04.910 --> 00:38:08.960
And besides ordinary electrical
charge, there are

00:38:08.960 --> 00:38:11.890
various weak charges that
are associated, as well.

00:38:11.890 --> 00:38:13.880
And we can plot these things,
and yes, indeed, this forms a

00:38:13.880 --> 00:38:15.350
very beautiful pattern.

00:38:15.350 --> 00:38:18.140
So one of the things that
modern-day particle physicists

00:38:18.140 --> 00:38:21.070
do is they come up with models
based on symmetries.

00:38:21.070 --> 00:38:24.760
And when you hear about things
like at the Large Hadron

00:38:24.760 --> 00:38:29.740
Collider, or Brookhaven, or
elsewhere, discovering a new

00:38:29.740 --> 00:38:32.320
particle that they thought to
exist, it was because there

00:38:32.320 --> 00:38:35.930
was a hole in this diagram of
what we actually discovered

00:38:35.930 --> 00:38:37.180
versus what had been
predicted.

00:38:44.010 --> 00:38:47.590
Even things that seem like they
are symmetry breaking--

00:38:47.590 --> 00:38:49.710
and they are symmetry breaking,
things like the

00:38:49.710 --> 00:38:52.340
discrete discovery about the
Higgs boson, for example--

00:38:52.340 --> 00:38:56.750
are built on the idea
of a fundamental

00:38:56.750 --> 00:38:57.820
symmetry of the universe.

00:38:57.820 --> 00:39:00.390
The idea of the Higgs boson
is that there is

00:39:00.390 --> 00:39:01.560
an additional field.

00:39:01.560 --> 00:39:03.220
An additional field that-- you
know, you can look at that

00:39:03.220 --> 00:39:03.950
little pattern--

00:39:03.950 --> 00:39:07.440
was initially symmetric, but
at some early time when the

00:39:07.440 --> 00:39:10.730
universe became colder, much
like ice freezing into a

00:39:10.730 --> 00:39:17.310
crystal or anything else, that
initial symmetry breaking got

00:39:17.310 --> 00:39:18.870
frozen into the universe.

00:39:18.870 --> 00:39:20.570
The Higgs--

00:39:20.570 --> 00:39:23.240
yet another one of these
fundamental discoveries of how

00:39:23.240 --> 00:39:24.680
we understand the universe
to work--

00:39:24.680 --> 00:39:27.090
also built upon this symmetry
foundation.

00:39:30.670 --> 00:39:35.630
So if there are such beautiful
symmetries in the universe--

00:39:35.630 --> 00:39:36.660
and there are--

00:39:36.660 --> 00:39:39.000
the question is, why isn't

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:40.300
everything perfectly symmetric?

00:39:40.300 --> 00:39:42.110
I mean, I've pointed to
individual cases--

00:39:42.110 --> 00:39:45.410
matter and antimatter don't
perfectly annihilate because

00:39:45.410 --> 00:39:46.810
there seems to be a
slight symmetry

00:39:46.810 --> 00:39:47.880
breaking, blah, blah, blah.

00:39:47.880 --> 00:39:49.950
But we can ask the question,
where did all

00:39:49.950 --> 00:39:51.660
of that come from?

00:39:51.660 --> 00:39:54.810
And the answer seems to be
that for all of these

00:39:54.810 --> 00:39:56.960
symmetries in the universe,
there's also sort of a

00:39:56.960 --> 00:40:00.100
corresponding effect that
makes the universe

00:40:00.100 --> 00:40:02.530
interesting, that they can give
rise to things like us,

00:40:02.530 --> 00:40:03.470
that are complicated.

00:40:03.470 --> 00:40:07.900
That are, if you don't mind me
calling you this, breaks,

00:40:07.900 --> 00:40:10.520
mars, in the beautiful
simplicity and

00:40:10.520 --> 00:40:11.770
symmetry of the universe.

00:40:14.720 --> 00:40:16.980
And that is the randomness
that comes

00:40:16.980 --> 00:40:18.500
from quantum mechanics.

00:40:18.500 --> 00:40:23.250
So quantum mechanics has random
effects going into it.

00:40:23.250 --> 00:40:26.790
And I've got a little
illustration here.

00:40:26.790 --> 00:40:29.220
You can imagine starting
a series of tops,

00:40:29.220 --> 00:40:31.720
just perfectly arrayed.

00:40:31.720 --> 00:40:35.560
You may recognize these
from a popular movie.

00:40:35.560 --> 00:40:38.440
And you know that if you start
spinning a top, eventually, a

00:40:38.440 --> 00:40:40.550
real top will eventually
topple.

00:40:40.550 --> 00:40:43.616
Or not, depending on how much
you choose to read into that.

00:40:43.616 --> 00:40:45.950
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:45.950 --> 00:40:49.270
DAVE GOLDBERG: But which one
starts to topple first, and

00:40:49.270 --> 00:40:50.540
which direction it
topples in--

00:40:50.540 --> 00:40:52.510
you can imagine these things,
and you can see a few of them

00:40:52.510 --> 00:40:56.580
starting to topple,
just in this case.

00:40:56.580 --> 00:40:59.060
You start with something
perfectly symmetric.

00:40:59.060 --> 00:41:01.720
You add a random component, and
all of a sudden, you get

00:41:01.720 --> 00:41:03.840
some beautiful, beautiful
structure.

00:41:03.840 --> 00:41:09.080
And in short, that is the
story of our universe.

00:41:09.080 --> 00:41:10.774
Thanks very much.

00:41:10.774 --> 00:41:19.850
[APPLAUSE]

00:41:19.850 --> 00:41:20.720
DAVE GOLDBERG: Questions?

00:41:20.720 --> 00:41:23.197
This is the point when we
have questions, right?

00:41:30.540 --> 00:41:33.530
AUDIENCE: You were talking about
how all of the particles

00:41:33.530 --> 00:41:37.030
have anti versions
of themselves.

00:41:37.030 --> 00:41:38.190
What about the photon?

00:41:38.190 --> 00:41:40.010
Is there an anti-photon?

00:41:40.010 --> 00:41:40.520
DAVE GOLDBERG: So
you're right.

00:41:40.520 --> 00:41:43.280
I did do a little bit of
shorthand, because I didn't

00:41:43.280 --> 00:41:44.400
want to do too many caveats.

00:41:44.400 --> 00:41:45.210
You're absolutely correct.

00:41:45.210 --> 00:41:47.810
There are a few-- very few,
fewer than you'd think--

00:41:47.810 --> 00:41:50.230
particles that are their
own anti-particles.

00:41:50.230 --> 00:41:53.630
A photon is its own
anti-particle, as

00:41:53.630 --> 00:41:56.030
is the Higgs boson.

00:41:56.030 --> 00:42:00.480
But most other particles are not
their own anti-particles.

00:42:00.480 --> 00:42:04.830
So for example, if I take an
electron and a positron,

00:42:04.830 --> 00:42:06.560
particle and anti-particle
collide,

00:42:06.560 --> 00:42:08.150
it creates two photons.

00:42:08.150 --> 00:42:12.100
And there is no distinguishing
between which one's the

00:42:12.100 --> 00:42:14.320
particle version and which
one's the anti-particle.

00:42:14.320 --> 00:42:17.130
But you're quite right.

00:42:17.130 --> 00:42:20.010
AUDIENCE: What's your personal
opinion of supersymmetry,

00:42:20.010 --> 00:42:22.620
given that LHC hasn't
found it yet?

00:42:25.360 --> 00:42:29.490
DAVE GOLDBERG: So that's
a really good question.

00:42:29.490 --> 00:42:34.320
So supersymmetry involves--

00:42:34.320 --> 00:42:38.240
just to give a background to
those who are unfamiliar.

00:42:38.240 --> 00:42:41.260
Supersymmetry involves the
relationship between the two

00:42:41.260 --> 00:42:43.640
different fundamental
types of particles.

00:42:43.640 --> 00:42:47.200
There are particles called
fermions that are electrons

00:42:47.200 --> 00:42:50.010
that are the quarks that make up
our protons and neutrons--

00:42:50.010 --> 00:42:52.380
basically, the particles
of matter.

00:42:52.380 --> 00:42:56.875
And there are particles called
bosons, which are essentially

00:42:56.875 --> 00:42:57.900
the force-carriers.

00:42:57.900 --> 00:43:02.880
Those include photons and
gluons and the Higgs.

00:43:02.880 --> 00:43:07.250
And the idea is, why should we
have two such different groups

00:43:07.250 --> 00:43:10.880
of particles in different
quantities?

00:43:10.880 --> 00:43:12.480
And not just why should
we, but there's

00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:14.790
other technical reasons.

00:43:14.790 --> 00:43:18.600
You end up with, for example,
certain particles based on

00:43:18.600 --> 00:43:22.500
interactions should be hugely
more massive than they are,

00:43:22.500 --> 00:43:24.910
because the fermions sort
of subtract mass

00:43:24.910 --> 00:43:27.800
and bosons add mass.

00:43:27.800 --> 00:43:32.360
And unless they cancel or
partially cancel, what ends up

00:43:32.360 --> 00:43:35.040
happening is you end up
with a huge deficit,

00:43:35.040 --> 00:43:36.840
one way or the other.

00:43:36.840 --> 00:43:38.620
So there's a lot of sort
of fundamental reasons.

00:43:38.620 --> 00:43:41.780
And the idea that the people
come up with is that for every

00:43:41.780 --> 00:43:44.040
fermion, there must be a
corresponding boson, and every

00:43:44.040 --> 00:43:46.430
boson, there must be a
corresponding fermion.

00:43:46.430 --> 00:43:50.870
And many of these particles
are undiscovered.

00:43:50.870 --> 00:43:54.210
Many of these particles are
likely to be unstable.

00:43:54.210 --> 00:43:56.490
One hope, by the way, is that
there is such a thing called

00:43:56.490 --> 00:44:00.260
the lightest supersymmetric
particle, one that probably

00:44:00.260 --> 00:44:02.890
doesn't interact
very strongly--

00:44:02.890 --> 00:44:04.630
which we've sort of have
a placeholder called a

00:44:04.630 --> 00:44:06.240
neutralino--

00:44:06.240 --> 00:44:09.640
that might be this missing
dark-matter particle that

00:44:09.640 --> 00:44:11.230
we've been looking for.

00:44:11.230 --> 00:44:13.000
But we haven't detected
any of these partners.

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:18.230
And experiments like Large
Hadron Collider are capable of

00:44:18.230 --> 00:44:22.900
measuring some of these,
in principle.

00:44:22.900 --> 00:44:26.090
And hasn't-- that's the upshot
of your question.

00:44:26.090 --> 00:44:27.300
So now you're caught
up with the actual

00:44:27.300 --> 00:44:28.870
nature of the question.

00:44:28.870 --> 00:44:30.270
So the problem is--

00:44:30.270 --> 00:44:35.110
I mean, supersymmetry is such a
beautifully elegant theory.

00:44:35.110 --> 00:44:36.590
And here's the problem
with it.

00:44:36.590 --> 00:44:40.210
I mean, it solves a lot of
problems in particle physics.

00:44:40.210 --> 00:44:43.060
It is almost impossible to
disprove, because the number

00:44:43.060 --> 00:44:45.410
of parameters that you
can keep adjusting--

00:44:45.410 --> 00:44:50.350
there's what's called minimal
supersymmetric model, which

00:44:50.350 --> 00:44:52.950
with reasonable parameters that
most physicists would

00:44:52.950 --> 00:44:57.640
agree are reasonable, has been
essentially ruled out.

00:44:57.640 --> 00:44:59.860
But you can keep adding bells
and whistles, and you could

00:44:59.860 --> 00:45:04.240
put in unreasonable that don't
disprove the model.

00:45:04.240 --> 00:45:07.110
My personal feeling is
it's grasping at

00:45:07.110 --> 00:45:08.220
straws, at this point.

00:45:08.220 --> 00:45:10.200
I don't know what the
better solution is.

00:45:12.730 --> 00:45:14.730
There might be a more
complicated version of

00:45:14.730 --> 00:45:18.070
supersymmetry that could turn
out to be correct, but it's

00:45:18.070 --> 00:45:18.610
not looking good.

00:45:18.610 --> 00:45:20.830
In fact, that's a position I
take in the book, as well.

00:45:20.830 --> 00:45:24.090
I sort of say, look, here's
why we introduced it.

00:45:24.090 --> 00:45:27.090
Here's why there are problems.

00:45:27.090 --> 00:45:28.050
It hasn't been observed.

00:45:28.050 --> 00:45:31.165
And every time every time that
the threshold for observation

00:45:31.165 --> 00:45:35.540
gets higher and higher, things
look worse and worse.

00:45:35.540 --> 00:45:40.980
So honestly, my gut is saying,
at this point, no.

00:45:40.980 --> 00:45:42.170
But I don't know.

00:45:42.170 --> 00:45:43.000
I honestly don't.

00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:47.682
And I really don't know what
a better answer is.

00:45:47.682 --> 00:45:48.578
Yes?

00:45:48.578 --> 00:45:49.030
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:45:49.030 --> 00:45:53.520
So I have a question about
the arrow of time.

00:45:53.520 --> 00:45:59.160
So I've heard general arguments
about how, like,

00:45:59.160 --> 00:46:01.760
things are differentially
symmetric in time.

00:46:01.760 --> 00:46:03.330
So you could go backwards
in time, and it

00:46:03.330 --> 00:46:05.960
still looks like physics.

00:46:05.960 --> 00:46:09.450
But a lot of arguments I hear
about the arrow of time being

00:46:09.450 --> 00:46:12.120
biased in the way we perceive
it isn't this

00:46:12.120 --> 00:46:13.170
differential argument.

00:46:13.170 --> 00:46:15.660
It's this argument about
ensembles and entropy and

00:46:15.660 --> 00:46:16.290
stuff like that.

00:46:16.290 --> 00:46:20.740
So to me, those two thoughts in
my head are not reconciled

00:46:20.740 --> 00:46:22.140
in any constructive way.

00:46:22.140 --> 00:46:23.930
So could you elaborate
on the relationship

00:46:23.930 --> 00:46:24.860
between those two?

00:46:24.860 --> 00:46:25.230
DAVE GOLDBERG: Right.

00:46:25.230 --> 00:46:31.470
So yeah, I tried to take entire
of Chapter Two of my

00:46:31.470 --> 00:46:35.070
book and brush it into about 30
seconds of exposition here.

00:46:35.070 --> 00:46:37.890
So it's a fair question.

00:46:37.890 --> 00:46:41.640
So the issue is we've got
two different senses--

00:46:41.640 --> 00:46:43.430
at least two different
philosophers would probably

00:46:43.430 --> 00:46:45.230
give several more of
the arrow of time.

00:46:45.230 --> 00:46:46.100
One, you could call
it, almost, a

00:46:46.100 --> 00:46:47.840
psychological arrow, right?

00:46:47.840 --> 00:46:49.680
The remembering the past
and not the future.

00:46:49.680 --> 00:46:56.050
You've got an entropy arrow,
which is the increase in

00:46:56.050 --> 00:46:58.870
entropy goes toward
the future.

00:46:58.870 --> 00:47:00.790
We've also got an
arrow of time--

00:47:00.790 --> 00:47:03.490
at least in the equations, where
we're implying them-- in

00:47:03.490 --> 00:47:04.180
the weak force.

00:47:04.180 --> 00:47:08.025
Because we say the arrow goes
this way, and that's the one

00:47:08.025 --> 00:47:12.810
that defines how matter
works, and so on.

00:47:12.810 --> 00:47:14.725
And so part of the problem--

00:47:17.490 --> 00:47:21.000
and this is something I try
to approach in the book by

00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:22.880
getting humans out of the
equation entirely.

00:47:22.880 --> 00:47:24.520
Like we don't know
how brains work.

00:47:24.520 --> 00:47:29.180
But thinking about how a robot
or a disk drive or something

00:47:29.180 --> 00:47:30.640
like that would work.

00:47:30.640 --> 00:47:32.190
And you're a robot.

00:47:32.190 --> 00:47:33.100
You're awoken.

00:47:33.100 --> 00:47:36.920
You look at your disk.

00:47:36.920 --> 00:47:39.590
And you do not know--

00:47:39.590 --> 00:47:41.050
I mean, this is not about
the arrow of time.

00:47:41.050 --> 00:47:42.960
This is just sort of about
the relationship between

00:47:42.960 --> 00:47:46.090
information and entropy
and memories.

00:47:46.090 --> 00:47:48.850
You look at your disk, and
you see that all of your

00:47:48.850 --> 00:47:52.190
bits are set to 0.

00:47:52.190 --> 00:47:55.470
And you say, OK, this
is a clean slate.

00:47:55.470 --> 00:47:56.860
I am--

00:47:56.860 --> 00:47:58.904
I have no memories.

00:47:58.904 --> 00:48:02.030
On the other hand, I wake you
up as a robot, and there is

00:48:02.030 --> 00:48:04.360
this pattern of zeros
and ones.

00:48:04.360 --> 00:48:06.470
A complicated pattern,
not 0101.

00:48:06.470 --> 00:48:10.080
Some complicated thing that
you can't figure out,

00:48:10.080 --> 00:48:12.260
necessarily, what it means.

00:48:12.260 --> 00:48:14.070
You don't know anything else.

00:48:14.070 --> 00:48:17.060
The question is, are those
legitimate memories, or is

00:48:17.060 --> 00:48:18.310
that noise?

00:48:21.140 --> 00:48:24.710
And this is something we have
no great reconciliation to.

00:48:24.710 --> 00:48:27.810
Because our universe did start
with low entropy, and yet

00:48:27.810 --> 00:48:33.060
there's no physical principle
that says why that should be.

00:48:33.060 --> 00:48:35.190
And so the assumption is either
there's a physical

00:48:35.190 --> 00:48:43.720
principle we don't know, or
there are two states of the

00:48:43.720 --> 00:48:47.230
universe, one at low entropy and
one at high entropy, and

00:48:47.230 --> 00:48:50.590
there is another physical
principle that basically says

00:48:50.590 --> 00:48:53.220
the arrow of time is, by
definition, moving from the

00:48:53.220 --> 00:48:53.850
low to the high.

00:48:53.850 --> 00:48:57.850
Now I'll tell you what my
problem with that is, the sort

00:48:57.850 --> 00:49:00.120
of entropy making time.

00:49:00.120 --> 00:49:05.110
It is almost impossible to ever
describe a single state

00:49:05.110 --> 00:49:06.390
of the universe.

00:49:06.390 --> 00:49:08.180
I mean, because the universe is
not causally connected at

00:49:08.180 --> 00:49:09.470
any point to one another.

00:49:09.470 --> 00:49:14.310
So saying "The universe is
increasing in entropy" is an

00:49:14.310 --> 00:49:16.580
almost meaningless statement,
because there's no process by

00:49:16.580 --> 00:49:19.530
which something over the
entire universe can be

00:49:19.530 --> 00:49:22.930
integrated and calculated.

00:49:22.930 --> 00:49:26.090
So the fact that the whole
universe, or some part of the

00:49:26.090 --> 00:49:30.350
multiverse, which is now not
causally connected to one

00:49:30.350 --> 00:49:33.220
another, where some property
defined over that entire

00:49:33.220 --> 00:49:36.390
region then defines the arrow
of time, I don't see any

00:49:36.390 --> 00:49:38.670
mechanism for how
that could work.

00:49:38.670 --> 00:49:48.370
So it is absolutely an open
question, as to why the one

00:49:48.370 --> 00:49:50.740
should be related
to the other.

00:49:50.740 --> 00:49:57.910
The fact that time exists as a
dimension that behaves very,

00:49:57.910 --> 00:50:00.150
very different from space--

00:50:00.150 --> 00:50:04.030
like one could almost an
anthropic argument about that.

00:50:04.030 --> 00:50:05.900
So time does behave differently
from space.

00:50:05.900 --> 00:50:08.480
Regardless of which direction
the arrow of time is, the fact

00:50:08.480 --> 00:50:12.560
that there is dimension means
that we can do things like

00:50:12.560 --> 00:50:19.780
learn from the past, and make
inferences, and so on.

00:50:19.780 --> 00:50:22.660
Which we would not be able to do
in quite the same way if we

00:50:22.660 --> 00:50:24.860
lived in, say, four dimensions
in space with a universe with

00:50:24.860 --> 00:50:26.460
no time at all.

00:50:29.610 --> 00:50:31.840
And it may be that
there are part--

00:50:31.840 --> 00:50:32.950
if you believe in
the multiverse--

00:50:32.950 --> 00:50:34.440
there are parts of the
multiverse with different

00:50:34.440 --> 00:50:37.460
dimensionality, and we are
simply here because this is

00:50:37.460 --> 00:50:40.770
the most complicated one that
is anthropically favorable,

00:50:40.770 --> 00:50:45.020
such that we would be able to
exist at all, or anything

00:50:45.020 --> 00:50:46.550
would be able to exist at all.

00:50:46.550 --> 00:50:50.165
So I fully recognize I've given
you a non-answer, but

00:50:50.165 --> 00:50:52.900
I've hopefully sort of at least
laid out the space of

00:50:52.900 --> 00:50:55.282
the problem.

00:50:55.282 --> 00:50:55.720
Yes?

00:50:55.720 --> 00:50:57.650
AUDIENCE: So this is a question
about Noether's

00:50:57.650 --> 00:51:00.430
theorem and the weak force.

00:51:00.430 --> 00:51:02.900
So in Noether's theorem, the
things that are in variance,

00:51:02.900 --> 00:51:05.360
like space and time, give us
various conservation laws,

00:51:05.360 --> 00:51:07.050
like momentum and energy.

00:51:07.050 --> 00:51:11.030
So in a sort of
not-to-mathematical, elaborate

00:51:11.030 --> 00:51:14.060
way, what's the non-conserved
thing?

00:51:14.060 --> 00:51:16.230
What's the variant?

00:51:16.230 --> 00:51:20.250
What is the dissipative piece of
some equation that gives us

00:51:20.250 --> 00:51:24.980
the lack of conservation,
of CPT in weak force?

00:51:24.980 --> 00:51:30.440
DAVE GOLDBERG: So this is the
answer is, it's not a matter

00:51:30.440 --> 00:51:32.040
of saying that it's not
a conservation.

00:51:32.040 --> 00:51:36.050
It's more a matter of saying
that there's a very specific

00:51:36.050 --> 00:51:41.070
thing that is being conserved,
and it's the handedness.

00:51:41.070 --> 00:51:45.170
So it's not just a matter of
creating, in the weak force,

00:51:45.170 --> 00:51:47.010
creating particles
of all type.

00:51:47.010 --> 00:51:50.270
It's that when you create a
particle, you're creating a

00:51:50.270 --> 00:51:52.160
left-handed neutrino.

00:51:52.160 --> 00:51:55.030
Specifically a left-handed
neutrino, and specifically a

00:51:55.030 --> 00:51:57.310
right-handed anti-neutrino.

00:51:57.310 --> 00:51:58.700
And what that means--

00:51:58.700 --> 00:52:00.950
the reason that it's
left-handed versus

00:52:00.950 --> 00:52:03.290
right-handed means that
essentially, you're creating

00:52:03.290 --> 00:52:05.770
half as many types
of particles.

00:52:05.770 --> 00:52:08.380
We think, oh, what does it
matter whether the thing is

00:52:08.380 --> 00:52:10.420
spinning this way or
spinning that way?

00:52:10.420 --> 00:52:12.920
But from a physics perspective,
those are two

00:52:12.920 --> 00:52:15.650
different particles.

00:52:15.650 --> 00:52:19.880
And so what it means is that
we are essentially--

00:52:19.880 --> 00:52:22.360
we are essentially getting half
as many particles out of

00:52:22.360 --> 00:52:25.500
the equations, half as many
particles getting dumped out

00:52:25.500 --> 00:52:28.990
of these equations, as we might
otherwise have if the

00:52:28.990 --> 00:52:30.510
thing was both left-handed
and right-handed.

00:52:33.140 --> 00:52:34.260
So we're only getting one.

00:52:34.260 --> 00:52:39.180
So from a practical perspective,
when we think

00:52:39.180 --> 00:52:43.090
about all the statistics of
the universe, we count in

00:52:43.090 --> 00:52:45.760
order to figure out things like
pressure and so on, how

00:52:45.760 --> 00:52:48.920
many different particles
could exist.

00:52:48.920 --> 00:52:51.860
Electrons, which can be
either spin direction,

00:52:51.860 --> 00:52:53.680
we count for two.

00:52:53.680 --> 00:52:56.560
Neutrinos, for each species,
we only count for one, for

00:52:56.560 --> 00:52:57.390
exactly that reason.

00:52:57.390 --> 00:53:00.100
Because there's essentially half
as many effective species

00:53:00.100 --> 00:53:02.288
as there might otherwise be.

00:53:06.680 --> 00:53:08.290
Are there other questions?

00:53:11.272 --> 00:53:11.770
No.

00:53:11.770 --> 00:53:12.790
Thank you.

00:53:12.790 --> 00:53:13.390
Oh.

00:53:13.390 --> 00:53:15.190
[APPLAUSE]

00:53:15.190 --> 00:53:16.990
DAVE GOLDBERG: Thanks
so much for coming.
