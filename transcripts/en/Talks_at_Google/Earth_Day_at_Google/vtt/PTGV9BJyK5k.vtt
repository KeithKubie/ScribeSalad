REBECCA MOORE: Welcome
to a sure-to-be-fantastic

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:09.090
presentation by Dr. Andrew
Steer of the World Resources

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:10.800
Institute.

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.060
It's my pleasure to
introduce Dr. Steer.

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:14.570
My name's Rebecca Moore.

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:16.410
I lead the Google
Earth team, which

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.860
also includes Google Earth
Engine, Google Earth Outreach,

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:25.190
and we're affectionately known
internally as earthlings.

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:29.140
My team has worked with Andrew's
team for a number of years.

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:32.240
I'll say a little bit
more about that later.

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:36.280
World Resources Institute--
it doesn't brag about it

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.520
in your bio-- but
they are considered

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:44.630
to be by many accounts the
most authoritative, credible

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:48.670
environmental research
organization in the world.

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:50.310
They're extremely
effective and they

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:54.810
work at the intersection of
science, research, policy,

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:56.320
economic development.

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.930
They have incredible
impact on the ground

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:00.940
from global to local.

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:05.069
They create instruments and
indices and measurements

00:01:05.069 --> 00:01:08.470
that are the standard by which
countries all over the world

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:10.620
measure themselves.

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:13.860
They are really the
organization that

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:20.590
is taking a close guardianship
look over our natural resources

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:23.790
in a very authoritative way.

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.940
They have 450 experts that
work with leaders to address

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:30.860
six urgent global challenges.

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:36.140
with a focus on forests,
food, water, climate, energy,

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.320
and cities.

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.010
Dr. Steer joined WRI
from the World Bank

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:44.150
where he was special
envoy for climate change.

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:48.730
He's also currently co-chair of
the World Economic Forum Global

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:51.880
Agenda Council on
Natural Capital.

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:53.950
If you don't know what
natural capital is,

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:55.410
you should Google it.

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:59.420
It's a term you
should all understand.

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.410
He was educated at Saint
Andrews University, Cambridge

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:04.770
University, University
of Pennsylvania

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.890
with a PhD in Economics.

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.509
And again, I wanted
to just step back.

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.330
My Google Earth team-- in
particular, Google Earth Engine

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.830
and Google Earth
Outreach-- has been

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.570
working with Andrew's
team for several years

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:23.260
on the development of a couple
of really transformative

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.260
technology platforms.

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.010
The main one is called
Global Forest Watch,

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:34.360
which is the world's first
high resolution near real time

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.780
global forest monitoring system.

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.840
It's powered by
Google Earth Engine.

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:41.680
We work together from
the very early days

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:46.120
of white-boarding a design
on a Google white board

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.150
with his team.

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.950
And it launched in 2014 and
now is having fantastic impacts

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.590
that I hope that you will
speak a little bit about.

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:59.950
It's been a great partnership
because what Google

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:03.620
has to offer, of course,
is massive computational

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:09.220
resources, massive data,
fantastic ability to process

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.182
algorithms on this data.

00:03:11.182 --> 00:03:12.390
But we're not the scientists.

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:14.000
We're not the policy people.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.140
We don't know the
levers of change

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.320
for environmental protection.

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:20.420
And WRI does.

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:23.440
So it's been a fantastic,
fantastic partnership

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:25.680
with you, Global Forest Watch.

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.380
Now they're working on
Global Resources Watch,

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:32.330
which will also be
powered to some degree

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:33.780
by Google Earth Engine.

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.090
And we're really
excited that you

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:39.280
exist and are doing
the great work that you

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.366
do to protect,
preserve, and educate us

00:03:42.366 --> 00:03:43.240
all about the planet.

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:48.120
So he's going to speak today
about stories to watch in 2016.

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.310
And please give a warm
welcome to Dr. Andrew Steer.

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:51.310
ANDREW STEER: Thank you.

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:58.265
Thank you, Rebecca
very much indeed.

00:03:58.265 --> 00:04:00.410
It is just the most
wonderful partnership

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:02.950
that we have with
the earthlings.

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:06.490
Thank you, and friends like
David over there and Saleem,

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:09.400
I mean it really is a joy
to work with you guys.

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:12.610
You are making the world
a much, much better place.

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:18.189
And we are deeply
privileged to work with you.

00:04:18.189 --> 00:04:20.220
What we do once a
year, at the beginning

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:22.630
of the year at the World
Resource Institute,

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:24.840
we get our experts
together, and we say,

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:26.900
what should we be watching
in the coming year?

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:28.800
We come up with
sort of five or six

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.530
what we call, stories to watch.

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:33.060
This is actually the
14th year we've done it.

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:35.270
And then at the end of the
year we look back and say,

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:38.600
did those stories turn out the
way that we hoped they would.

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:41.120
And so what I was going to
do today quite quickly-- I'm

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:44.170
going to go through quite a
lot of slides quite quickly--

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:50.400
is lay out five
stories for 2016.

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:54.202
We believe that this is a
very, very important year.

00:04:54.202 --> 00:04:56.410
One of the reasons is the
picture on here, of course,

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:57.340
it's Paris.

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:59.500
And there was the
historic climate deal,

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:01.810
which I suspect some of
you-- I know some of you

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:03.840
were at in December.

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:06.080
And we think that's going
to be a game changer.

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:08.720
So let me plunge right in.

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:10.650
And then we'll have a
discussion afterwards.

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:12.130
And you may have
your own stories,

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:14.170
or you may disagree
with these stories.

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:18.250
But I hope it at least
stimulates some thought.

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:20.490
Look, this is a difficult
world we live in right now.

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:23.680
The past year has been
extraordinarily difficult.

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:25.810
More refugees in
the last year than

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:27.630
any year since World War II.

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:30.160
For us as Americans,
hard to really realize

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:31.120
how important it is.

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:34.290
But in Europe, it's
been a game changer.

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:37.700
So too, terrorism
spiked last year

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:40.200
in a very, very dangerous way.

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:43.050
It is a dangerous
world we live in.

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:45.940
And the economy is also
in pretty bad shape.

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:49.060
As we enter 2016,
the worst economic

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:53.520
start to any year
for several decades.

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:57.020
And all of the projections of
the world economy are gloomy.

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:01.870
So it's sort of a rather
dismal time-- or is it?

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:04.080
Remarkable signs of hope.

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:05.770
In the last year,
I was privileged

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:09.130
to be in this room-- it's the
General Assembly of the United

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:13.980
Nations-- last September
when the Pope spoke.

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:17.720
And after the
Pope, Shakira sang.

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:21.030
And you notice, she's actually
dressed quite similarly

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:22.200
to the Pope.

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:24.420
And you'll notice also,
here everyone is sitting.

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:27.170
But when Shakira started
singing, they were stood up,

00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:28.050
you see.

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:31.730
And after Shakira
sang, the entire world

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:36.120
represented by 196 countries
approved unanimously

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:37.696
the sustainable
development goals.

00:06:37.696 --> 00:06:39.570
And I'm going to talk
about that in a minute.

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:43.740
These are goals to 2030 and
a very, very important thing.

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:45.590
And then just
three months later,

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:50.230
we had this in Paris,
basically, a historic agreement

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:51.440
on climate.

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:54.300
And so what 2016 is
all about is moving,

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:57.410
if you like, from
commitments and agreements

00:06:57.410 --> 00:07:01.020
to real action on the ground,
getting the plumbing right,

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:03.760
doing the investment.

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:06.020
And so the stories I'm
going to talk about

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:08.500
are mainly related to
that-- how are we now going

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:11.220
to get on with it and deliver.

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:12.940
And obviously, the
first story is about,

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:17.430
will the momentum that
countries committed to in Paris,

00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:18.801
will it continue?

00:07:18.801 --> 00:07:20.300
Now what actually
happened in Paris?

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:22.300
And some of you know
this, some won't.

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:25.830
I mean never before have we
had 187 countries saying,

00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:29.410
we are going to be part of the
solution to climate change.

00:07:29.410 --> 00:07:32.390
So too, never before have
we had a long-term goal

00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:36.480
of decarbonization
of the world economy.

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:39.420
Every five years countries
are to come back and raise

00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:41.290
their level of ambition.

00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:44.910
Every country has to agree
to common transparency

00:07:44.910 --> 00:07:47.270
about how they measure
their emissions.

00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:49.540
We've got good
agreements on adaptation,

00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:51.220
and we've got some
financial support.

00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:53.030
So this is really important.

00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:59.380
This is where we were heading
in terms of temperature.

00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:01.510
Because of the
commitments in Paris,

00:08:01.510 --> 00:08:03.660
this is where we're heading now.

00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:08.540
It's still 4.8 to 6.6
degrees Fahrenheit.

00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:11.550
This is where Paris
agreed we needed to be.

00:08:11.550 --> 00:08:14.110
So whilst this is a huge
achievement what countries

00:08:14.110 --> 00:08:16.630
have committed it is
not enough, and we

00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:20.060
need to continually
ramp up the ambition.

00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:23.780
So on the 22nd of April, all
the countries in the world

00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:29.360
will meet again to officially
sign the declaration at Paris.

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:32.230
And we'll learn a lot then as
to whether or not the level

00:08:32.230 --> 00:08:37.020
of passion and commitment that
existed in Paris will continue.

00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:41.070
And it's important that it does
because business community is

00:08:41.070 --> 00:08:42.919
not yet sure whether it's real.

00:08:42.919 --> 00:08:46.340
This is what we did at the
World Economic Forum last month.

00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:51.650
They ask 1,000 opinion makers--
CEOs of major corporations.

00:08:51.650 --> 00:08:54.490
And the question
was, of 50 risks,

00:08:54.490 --> 00:08:57.100
which is the one that
worries you the most?

00:08:57.100 --> 00:08:59.070
And along here, it
is the likelihood

00:08:59.070 --> 00:09:00.270
of the risk happening.

00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:03.140
Up here is the impact
if it does happen.

00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:07.350
The number one risk up here
for business people of all

00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:10.700
is not whether interest
rates will fall or rise

00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:12.140
or they'll be a recession.

00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:14.060
It is there'll be a
failure in climate change.

00:09:14.060 --> 00:09:19.450
This is the business community
saying, this matters to us.

00:09:19.450 --> 00:09:22.230
So these are the countries
that are committed to actually

00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:23.930
address carbon emissions.

00:09:23.930 --> 00:09:29.490
The blue ones are committed to
actually reduce tons of carbon.

00:09:29.490 --> 00:09:32.900
The green ones, they are
committed to reduce carbon

00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:36.430
as a share of their
national income.

00:09:36.430 --> 00:09:39.040
And so we will know
throughout this year

00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:42.370
whether there is a seriousness
about implementing that.

00:09:42.370 --> 00:09:45.580
And we also need to look at
some specific countries who

00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:48.750
have made specific
sectoral commitments.

00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:52.360
So India, for example, is
a hugely important country

00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:52.945
as you know.

00:09:52.945 --> 00:09:55.850
They have committed under the
new prime minister, Narendra

00:09:55.850 --> 00:10:00.390
Modi, to investing 100
gigawatts of solar.

00:10:00.390 --> 00:10:02.970
Today it's three
gigawatts of solar.

00:10:02.970 --> 00:10:05.830
The predecessor
government said, by 2022,

00:10:05.830 --> 00:10:07.946
we're going to do 20 gigawatts.

00:10:07.946 --> 00:10:09.320
And prime minister
Modi said, no.

00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:11.990
By 2022, we're going
to do 100 gigawatts.

00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:14.230
So we will know this
year whether there's

00:10:14.230 --> 00:10:15.880
a seriousness about that.

00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:17.500
So that's story number 1.

00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:22.240
It is, will there be
momentum from countries?

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:24.820
Story number 2 is
similar to that,

00:10:24.820 --> 00:10:26.240
but it doesn't
apply to countries.

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:30.280
It applies to corporations,
and it applies to city mayors.

00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:34.440
Because in Paris, it wasn't only
the countries that committed.

00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:37.730
It was really amazing
commitments from corporations

00:10:37.730 --> 00:10:39.035
and from cities.

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:43.350
This was just one meeting
that I had the privilege

00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:47.970
to be at and speak at, which had
about 70 CEOs from companies.

00:10:47.970 --> 00:10:50.830
Paris, more than 1,000
companies committed

00:10:50.830 --> 00:10:53.130
to put a price on
carbon, for example.

00:10:53.130 --> 00:10:58.070
150 US companies committed
to support aggressive climate

00:10:58.070 --> 00:10:58.760
action.

00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:01.450
120 companies is
committed to what are

00:11:01.450 --> 00:11:03.270
called science-based targets.

00:11:03.270 --> 00:11:05.410
In other words, we
won't only do better.

00:11:05.410 --> 00:11:09.110
We will do enough
based on the science.

00:11:09.110 --> 00:11:11.500
And what we'll be looking for
this year is whether there

00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:15.440
are more companies that
actually are going to say,

00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:18.550
here's what our target is
to be part of the solution.

00:11:18.550 --> 00:11:20.300
These are ones that
have already announced

00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:23.110
precisely what
they will be doing

00:11:23.110 --> 00:11:24.664
in terms of greenhouse gases.

00:11:24.664 --> 00:11:26.580
And they're going to
monitor that year by year

00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:29.060
and be accountable to that.

00:11:29.060 --> 00:11:32.652
So too, Google has
been as you know

00:11:32.652 --> 00:11:35.880
perhaps the leader in the
world on renewable energy.

00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:37.380
And we have some
of our friends here

00:11:37.380 --> 00:11:40.390
that are leading that work,
both on your purchasing side,

00:11:40.390 --> 00:11:42.610
but also on your investing side.

00:11:42.610 --> 00:11:45.490
And Google has really
led the pack in many ways

00:11:45.490 --> 00:11:48.050
on what's called
RE100-- a commitment

00:11:48.050 --> 00:11:52.820
to be 100% reliant
on renewable energy.

00:11:52.820 --> 00:11:54.520
And of course,
Google not only is

00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:58.360
100% going to rely on that
for the energy you need.

00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:02.600
You are also generating
gigawatts-- you will be.

00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:05.700
You're already generating 2
gigawatts for your own leads,

00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:07.860
but you're going to be
generating gigawatts.

00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:10.400
They're astonishing commitments.

00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:12.580
One of the things we're
looking at in this coming

00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:15.980
year for the private sector
is, all of these companies that

00:12:15.980 --> 00:12:19.110
made these commitments and
gave fabulous speeches,

00:12:19.110 --> 00:12:22.360
will their trade associations
and will their lobbying efforts

00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:23.880
be consistent with that?

00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:28.400
We recently did a study, and we
saw that 60% of major companies

00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:31.020
say the right
things, but of that,

00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:35.432
only one quarter of that number
actually align their lobbying

00:12:35.432 --> 00:12:36.140
towards that end.

00:12:36.140 --> 00:12:37.290
And one of the great
things about Google

00:12:37.290 --> 00:12:38.790
is you're very consistent.

00:12:38.790 --> 00:12:41.660
And we would love to see an
even greater profile of you

00:12:41.660 --> 00:12:43.880
lobbying to actually
get the government

00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:45.380
into the right place.

00:12:45.380 --> 00:12:47.180
And so this is a
very important story

00:12:47.180 --> 00:12:49.980
to watch because trade
associations generally

00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:53.460
lag their members
in wanting change.

00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:55.170
So Chamber of
Commerce and others

00:12:55.170 --> 00:12:58.120
are still, quite frankly, rather
old fashioned in their views

00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:02.280
on some of these important
issues on sustainability.

00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:04.060
That was the private sector.

00:13:04.060 --> 00:13:07.030
But equally important-- mayors.

00:13:07.030 --> 00:13:10.570
Something like 500
mayors went to Paris.

00:13:10.570 --> 00:13:13.180
This is Mayor Bloomberg,
who sort of led the charges,

00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:15.150
the Paris city hall.

00:13:15.150 --> 00:13:20.190
And 425 committed to what's
called the compact of mayors.

00:13:20.190 --> 00:13:23.737
And what they said is we
will be transparent about

00:13:23.737 --> 00:13:25.320
and we will measure
and be transparent

00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:27.060
about our greenhouse gases.

00:13:27.060 --> 00:13:28.640
And we will have
goals that are more

00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:31.059
ambitious than our nations.

00:13:31.059 --> 00:13:32.850
And what we're going
to do this coming year

00:13:32.850 --> 00:13:35.200
is really to monitor this.

00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:37.810
We're helping many of
these cities measure,

00:13:37.810 --> 00:13:41.590
and we're going to see, is there
seriousness in this enthusiasm?

00:13:41.590 --> 00:13:43.040
Is it continued?

00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:46.380
And one of the important things
that will happen this year

00:13:46.380 --> 00:13:48.440
will happen in October.

00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:52.520
Every 20 years, they have a
big conference called Habitat.

00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:56.670
And this one is the
first for 20 years.

00:13:56.670 --> 00:14:00.190
And the question will
be, is the new way

00:14:00.190 --> 00:14:03.130
of doing city is going
to be the theme of this?

00:14:03.130 --> 00:14:05.370
Because it turns out
that whether or not

00:14:05.370 --> 00:14:07.900
we win or lose the battle
against climate change,

00:14:07.900 --> 00:14:10.650
we depend upon how
we design our cities.

00:14:10.650 --> 00:14:13.000
And the moment cities
can be the problem,

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.180
or cities can be the solution.

00:14:15.180 --> 00:14:19.260
Two cities with the
same population, one

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:22.170
can have 10 times the
carbon emissions of another.

00:14:22.170 --> 00:14:25.540
And what we're learning now is
if you actually design cities

00:14:25.540 --> 00:14:28.510
around people rather
than around automobiles,

00:14:28.510 --> 00:14:31.850
you can have a more efficient
as well as a more sustainable

00:14:31.850 --> 00:14:32.610
city.

00:14:32.610 --> 00:14:38.880
So that's the second
story for 2016.

00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:43.600
The third story is this, which
relates directly to all of you.

00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:46.970
I told you that there were the
sustainable development goals.

00:14:46.970 --> 00:14:50.235
This was New York City
when they were announced.

00:14:50.235 --> 00:14:51.700
These are very, very important.

00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:55.810
I mean this is the entire
world agreeing on the goals it

00:14:55.810 --> 00:14:59.920
will have for 2030.

00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:01.970
And this is how
they're organized.

00:15:01.970 --> 00:15:07.220
So there's goals on poverty,
on ending hunger, health,

00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:09.010
education, et cetera.

00:15:09.010 --> 00:15:16.490
And down here, the decent work,
clean energy, climate, oceans,

00:15:16.490 --> 00:15:20.400
forests, inequality--
so you see all of these.

00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:22.780
And there are 17 goals.

00:15:22.780 --> 00:15:25.560
And there are 169 targets.

00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:28.030
So a target, for
example, could be

00:15:28.030 --> 00:15:32.905
to double the rate of
renewable energy, say.

00:15:32.905 --> 00:15:36.220
And there, it's going to
be 200 proposed indicate.

00:15:36.220 --> 00:15:40.060
The story for 2016
is, are they going

00:15:40.060 --> 00:15:44.350
to really use modern
techniques to measure progress?

00:15:44.350 --> 00:15:47.560
And that gets into the kind of
thing that we do with Google.

00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:51.770
So for example, how will
they choose to measure?

00:15:51.770 --> 00:15:53.580
The old fashioned
way of measuring

00:15:53.580 --> 00:15:57.570
is to get some UN agency to
spend a long time collecting

00:15:57.570 --> 00:16:00.140
data, publish a thick report.

00:16:00.140 --> 00:16:02.380
And gradually it
reaches governments,

00:16:02.380 --> 00:16:05.090
and slowly it might
affect decisions.

00:16:05.090 --> 00:16:10.780
But nowadays, we have 1,261
satellites up there every day

00:16:10.780 --> 00:16:13.120
beaming back
unbelievable information.

00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:15.910
And there are people in this
room that know more about how

00:16:15.910 --> 00:16:19.550
to turn these billions
of data points

00:16:19.550 --> 00:16:23.030
into information in a
user-friendly way sitting

00:16:23.030 --> 00:16:26.300
on the desk of a minister
of finance in Jakarta

00:16:26.300 --> 00:16:28.170
than anyone else on the planet.

00:16:28.170 --> 00:16:31.860
And it will be transformative
if we get this right.

00:16:31.860 --> 00:16:34.770
So for example,
agricultural productivity.

00:16:34.770 --> 00:16:38.460
We can do 1,000 different
soil samples and all that.

00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:41.480
Or we can also use
remote sensing, which

00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:45.400
can actually predict harvests.

00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:46.920
Consider GDP even.

00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:49.330
This is work that you guys do.

00:16:49.330 --> 00:16:54.090
You can actually predict sales
by lots of simple little tricks

00:16:54.090 --> 00:16:55.575
and algorithms.

00:16:55.575 --> 00:16:58.790
This is counting cars in a
car park in a shopping mall.

00:16:58.790 --> 00:17:00.770
Doing that right,
learning, continually

00:17:00.770 --> 00:17:03.040
revising the algorithms
in the relationship,

00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:07.430
you can get real data in the
hands of real decision makers

00:17:07.430 --> 00:17:09.880
much, much quicker in a
very transformative way.

00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:12.099
We can even measure
poverty differently.

00:17:12.099 --> 00:17:14.970
I think you guys are
also involved in this.

00:17:14.970 --> 00:17:17.369
Poverty measurement is
exceedingly difficult

00:17:17.369 --> 00:17:19.349
if it has to be done
by household surveys.

00:17:19.349 --> 00:17:21.380
We still should do
that, but then there

00:17:21.380 --> 00:17:25.210
are tricks of actually
using proxies, for example,

00:17:25.210 --> 00:17:26.306
using remote sensing.

00:17:26.306 --> 00:17:28.180
I'd love to go into
that-- what kind of roof,

00:17:28.180 --> 00:17:31.750
how many have changed the roof,
all kinds of things like that.

00:17:31.750 --> 00:17:33.840
This is what we were talking.

00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:36.150
Rebecca mentioned
Global Forest Watch.

00:17:36.150 --> 00:17:38.050
Again, transformative.

00:17:38.050 --> 00:17:41.700
In the old days, I remember
talking to President Yudhoyono

00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:42.500
of Indonesia.

00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:46.680
He said, I don't know if my
forest policies in Kalimantan

00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:49.320
are being honored
because I get something

00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:51.060
like a year and a half late.

00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:51.960
And so I don't know.

00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:54.360
He says, now I've got
something that tells

00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:56.280
me what happened last week.

00:17:56.280 --> 00:17:58.230
And it tells me exactly
where it happened.

00:17:58.230 --> 00:18:01.370
So I know exactly
who to blame and who

00:18:01.370 --> 00:18:02.870
to send where to solve it.

00:18:02.870 --> 00:18:04.880
This is a very, very
remarkable thing.

00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:06.480
We'd love to talk
to you about it

00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:10.160
much more because without
you this would not exist.

00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:12.160
It's a really wonderful thing.

00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:13.980
And we are seeing
all around the world,

00:18:13.980 --> 00:18:15.800
every single
country in the world

00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:19.600
has now used this for
serious policy decisions,

00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:21.470
except for North
Korea to [INAUDIBLE].

00:18:21.470 --> 00:18:23.800
So if anybody has
links in North Korea,

00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:26.760
we would love to
make it complete.

00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:28.000
So that's land use change.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.330
And so too, we're using
the same technique now

00:18:30.330 --> 00:18:33.880
for actually assessing carbon
emissions from deforestation.

00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:36.420
We launched Paris,
again, with you,

00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:40.550
where due to a lot of
advances in the way

00:18:40.550 --> 00:18:45.230
we understand emissions of
carbon from deforestation,

00:18:45.230 --> 00:18:46.550
we're able to do that.

00:18:46.550 --> 00:18:49.480
And there are just so
many applications of this

00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:51.260
that I would love to talk about.

00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:53.130
So too on water.

00:18:53.130 --> 00:18:56.450
Collecting data on water
is exceedingly difficult.

00:18:56.450 --> 00:18:59.080
We now have some fairly
sophisticated modeling

00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:04.750
capabilities across 15,000
of the main watersheds

00:19:04.750 --> 00:19:05.680
in the world.

00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:08.220
And now for the
first time ever we

00:19:08.220 --> 00:19:10.850
are using remote
sensing to actually look

00:19:10.850 --> 00:19:13.840
at a water quality, which we've
never managed to do before.

00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:18.480
So this is a very, very
important issue for 2016

00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:22.460
as the world begins to implement
its sustainable development

00:19:22.460 --> 00:19:22.960
goals.

00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:24.376
And together with
Google-- I think

00:19:24.376 --> 00:19:27.310
we're partners together in
this idea of resource watch--

00:19:27.310 --> 00:19:30.490
is basically saying, OK, what we
did for Global Forest Watch is

00:19:30.490 --> 00:19:31.130
fine.

00:19:31.130 --> 00:19:33.213
We're not going to put
lots of different overlays.

00:19:33.213 --> 00:19:36.780
So they will be very,
very easy to actually do

00:19:36.780 --> 00:19:40.270
all kinds of comparisons
and look at relationships.

00:19:40.270 --> 00:19:44.160
This is going to be a
very big project for us,

00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:45.930
which we are planning
to launch this year.

00:19:45.930 --> 00:19:49.782
And we are really thrilled to
be doing it together with you.

00:19:49.782 --> 00:19:51.990
Let me just give you one
example of the kind of thing

00:19:51.990 --> 00:19:53.250
that will be on this.

00:19:53.250 --> 00:19:59.880
We can project a water risk
using 12 different indicators

00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:03.120
using projections
from the IPCC, which

00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:05.650
is the scientific body
that tells us what

00:20:05.650 --> 00:20:07.090
will happen on climate change.

00:20:07.090 --> 00:20:08.710
And then we overlay,
for example,

00:20:08.710 --> 00:20:10.290
all these black things.

00:20:10.290 --> 00:20:12.722
The color is how
intense the water

00:20:12.722 --> 00:20:14.930
risk is and whether or not
it's going to be changing,

00:20:14.930 --> 00:20:15.640
getting worse.

00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:19.950
The black marks are
actually coal, coal plants

00:20:19.950 --> 00:20:21.410
to generate electricity.

00:20:21.410 --> 00:20:23.740
Why are these two
relevant together?

00:20:23.740 --> 00:20:26.720
You need an awful
lot of water in order

00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:29.350
to generate electricity
from coal, for example.

00:20:29.350 --> 00:20:34.480
So if you are an Indian, a
minister responsible for energy

00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:38.550
security, this is extremely
helpful and actually

00:20:38.550 --> 00:20:40.950
very worrying information.

00:20:40.950 --> 00:20:44.890
That's an example of how
putting different layers on top

00:20:44.890 --> 00:20:47.610
of each other actually
make a huge difference.

00:20:47.610 --> 00:20:51.580
If you do the same by the way
of this on irrigated water,

00:20:51.580 --> 00:20:55.320
you see a really astonishing
worrying situation

00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:57.720
for food security
because you see

00:20:57.720 --> 00:21:01.580
that the average irrigated
hectare in South Asia

00:21:01.580 --> 00:21:04.070
may today need to
feed 28 people.

00:21:04.070 --> 00:21:07.450
It will need to feed
42 people at a time

00:21:07.450 --> 00:21:09.550
when water risk
and water scarcity

00:21:09.550 --> 00:21:10.940
will increase very
substantially.

00:21:10.940 --> 00:21:14.860
So you start getting the idea
of just how this could be.

00:21:14.860 --> 00:21:18.710
So what will this mean for the
implementation of these goals?

00:21:18.710 --> 00:21:21.170
We believe it will
be transformative.

00:21:21.170 --> 00:21:25.320
And actually, Google is very
central in a way that I'm sure

00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:27.550
some of you have thought
about, but many of you

00:21:27.550 --> 00:21:31.050
haven't-- central actually to
the sustainable development

00:21:31.050 --> 00:21:33.995
goals and the extent to which
decision makers all around

00:21:33.995 --> 00:21:36.370
the world, whether they're
prime ministers and presidents

00:21:36.370 --> 00:21:39.770
or whether they are CEOs of
companies or whether they are

00:21:39.770 --> 00:21:43.500
village leaders
can really affect.

00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:47.270
So that was story number
three-- the transformative role

00:21:47.270 --> 00:21:47.979
of big data.

00:21:47.979 --> 00:21:50.020
And I didn't talk about
artificial intelligence--

00:21:50.020 --> 00:21:53.550
I'd love to-- because that
is the coming thing which

00:21:53.550 --> 00:21:57.030
will radically change the
ability of policymakers

00:21:57.030 --> 00:21:59.650
to make decisions
quickly and effectively

00:21:59.650 --> 00:22:02.480
and get real-time
feedback from them.

00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:06.140
Story number 4--
quite different.

00:22:06.140 --> 00:22:09.070
And you may wonder why
it's such a big story.

00:22:09.070 --> 00:22:10.180
I mean food waste.

00:22:10.180 --> 00:22:12.640
I mean is it that important?

00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:16.900
And the answer is
yes, it really is.

00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:18.680
One third of all
food in the world

00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:22.610
is wasted as you produce it,
and it never actually enters

00:22:22.610 --> 00:22:25.130
anybody's mouth.

00:22:25.130 --> 00:22:26.890
It's incredibly expensive.

00:22:26.890 --> 00:22:30.530
A trillion, almost,
a year is wasted

00:22:30.530 --> 00:22:34.380
as a result of
that at a time when

00:22:34.380 --> 00:22:38.750
we're going to need to
increase food intake by 70%

00:22:38.750 --> 00:22:42.550
by 2050, which will require
agricultural productivity

00:22:42.550 --> 00:22:45.430
growth to be greater than it's
been for the last 40 years

00:22:45.430 --> 00:22:47.930
at a time when we don't have a
whole lot more forests to cut

00:22:47.930 --> 00:22:49.730
down and expand agriculture.

00:22:49.730 --> 00:22:51.130
So you get the point.

00:22:51.130 --> 00:22:53.530
So too, think about this.

00:22:53.530 --> 00:22:57.780
Food loss and waste is
equivalent to planting

00:22:57.780 --> 00:23:00.360
every single acre in
the United States,

00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:03.240
including where there are
buildings and roads, with food,

00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:07.180
tending it, fertilizing it,
watering it for a whole year.

00:23:07.180 --> 00:23:10.929
And then letting half of it rot,
and then burn the other half.

00:23:10.929 --> 00:23:12.470
That's what food
loss and wastes are.

00:23:12.470 --> 00:23:15.870
The entire United States--
continental United States.

00:23:15.870 --> 00:23:18.690
I mean you imagine what this
is doing to natural habitats

00:23:18.690 --> 00:23:22.440
because we're having to take a
lot more land for agriculture

00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:23.880
than we need.

00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:29.100
And finally, it's a dreadful
emitter of greenhouse gases.

00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:33.110
If food loss and
waste were a country,

00:23:33.110 --> 00:23:35.550
it would be the third
biggest emitter in the world

00:23:35.550 --> 00:23:37.460
just after the United States.

00:23:37.460 --> 00:23:40.100
So you start getting the idea
of why this is important.

00:23:40.100 --> 00:23:42.980
This is very, very
important indeed.

00:23:42.980 --> 00:23:45.870
And that's why one of the
sustainable development targets

00:23:45.870 --> 00:23:49.480
is to halve food loss
and waste by 2030.

00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:51.716
This was the United
Nations same meeting.

00:23:51.716 --> 00:23:53.340
This is where it was
agreed to do that.

00:23:53.340 --> 00:23:56.220
And the big question
is, will that happen?

00:23:56.220 --> 00:23:58.800
The first thing we need
is a global standard

00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:01.080
on how you measure food
loss and waste, which we

00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:03.070
are privileged to be designing.

00:24:03.070 --> 00:24:06.780
The consumer goods forum
has now adopted that.

00:24:06.780 --> 00:24:08.310
These are 400 members.

00:24:08.310 --> 00:24:11.520
They have agreed, not only to
adopt that common standard,

00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:16.940
but to cut their own food loss
and waste by half by 2025.

00:24:16.940 --> 00:24:22.460
The United States, within one
week of the global target being

00:24:22.460 --> 00:24:26.230
set, announced that they would--
we would, here, cut food loss

00:24:26.230 --> 00:24:27.437
and waste by half.

00:24:27.437 --> 00:24:29.020
It's going to be
very, very difficult.

00:24:29.020 --> 00:24:30.760
This is Tom Vilsack speaking.

00:24:30.760 --> 00:24:32.490
He's the Secretary
of Agriculture.

00:24:32.490 --> 00:24:34.880
Gina McCarthy on the
right-- she's head of EPA--

00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:38.510
are basically making
that announcement.

00:24:38.510 --> 00:24:41.800
And so too what we've done
is realize that, actually, it

00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:44.900
will be impossible, at a time
when food loss and waste is

00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:47.990
currently rising, to reduce
it by half, unless there

00:24:47.990 --> 00:24:51.450
is a political and a
psychological switch that

00:24:51.450 --> 00:24:51.950
goes on.

00:24:51.950 --> 00:24:55.240
So we've created something
called Champions 12.3

00:24:55.240 --> 00:24:59.280
because this target is
called Target 12.3 in the UN.

00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:01.100
This is a guy who
is head of Nestle,

00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:02.320
who is one of the champions.

00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:05.720
We put together
30 champions that

00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:08.710
will take it upon them--
they're all CEOs of corporations

00:25:08.710 --> 00:25:11.460
or ministers from
developing countries

00:25:11.460 --> 00:25:14.040
and from rich countries.

00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:18.170
It's headed by the CEO of Tesco,
which is the second biggest

00:25:18.170 --> 00:25:20.050
retailer in the
world and the one

00:25:20.050 --> 00:25:22.560
that is really out front
together with Walmart

00:25:22.560 --> 00:25:24.060
on trying to address this.

00:25:24.060 --> 00:25:26.570
Food loss and waste is
almost exactly the same

00:25:26.570 --> 00:25:28.950
in the developing
world as a share as it

00:25:28.950 --> 00:25:31.240
is in the rich world, but
for very different reasons.

00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:33.460
In the developing
world, it's food loss.

00:25:33.460 --> 00:25:36.320
In other words, it's
difficult to store the food,

00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:39.010
or rats eat it, and so
on, or it gets mildewy.

00:25:39.010 --> 00:25:42.400
In the rich
countries, it's waste.

00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:48.350
In other words, we don't consume
everything that is there.

00:25:48.350 --> 00:25:49.860
And so we're working on this.

00:25:49.860 --> 00:25:55.390
This is going to be a big
emerging story in 2016.

00:25:55.390 --> 00:25:55.890
OK.

00:25:55.890 --> 00:25:57.606
Heading into the
home straight now.

00:25:57.606 --> 00:25:58.730
So that was story number 4.

00:25:58.730 --> 00:26:01.680
There's just two
more left, so I hope

00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:03.440
we'll have plenty
time for discussion.

00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:07.180
Story number 5-- China
really has to be a story.

00:26:07.180 --> 00:26:10.620
China is going through
an extraordinary sort

00:26:10.620 --> 00:26:12.190
of transition.

00:26:12.190 --> 00:26:15.960
For the last 25 years,
this has been China.

00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:22.855
China has increased its real
income 10 times in 25 years.

00:26:22.855 --> 00:26:23.730
Can you imagine that?

00:26:23.730 --> 00:26:26.105
I mean no country in the
history of the world, especially

00:26:26.105 --> 00:26:28.020
a big one, has come
close to doing that.

00:26:28.020 --> 00:26:29.560
I mean it's been spectacular.

00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:33.900
So no wonder they're
looking so happy.

00:26:33.900 --> 00:26:38.210
But actually, it's not going
so well right now as you know.

00:26:38.210 --> 00:26:41.560
There are issues of economic
management, a huge sort

00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:45.420
of volatility in the stock
market, the perceptions

00:26:45.420 --> 00:26:48.680
of whether or not they'll slow
down or be a hard landing.

00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:50.490
And this is happening.

00:26:50.490 --> 00:26:55.130
This is now reaching an extend
that is extremely severe.

00:26:55.130 --> 00:26:57.120
Last November,
for the first time

00:26:57.120 --> 00:26:59.380
ever, they declared what
they call a Red Alert.

00:26:59.380 --> 00:27:02.460
They closed down schools
in many northern cities.

00:27:02.460 --> 00:27:05.720
They closed down factories
because it was simply

00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:06.960
too dangerous.

00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:11.012
Now, nobody needs to tell
the Chinese authorities

00:27:11.012 --> 00:27:11.970
that this is a problem.

00:27:11.970 --> 00:27:13.480
They know it full well.

00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:16.160
And that's why President
Xi on downwards

00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:20.500
continually says, look, we've
got to do things differently.

00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:24.510
We simply can't rely on the
quantity of growth anymore.

00:27:24.510 --> 00:27:25.910
We need to think this through.

00:27:25.910 --> 00:27:28.520
And China is the first
country in the world

00:27:28.520 --> 00:27:31.770
that, recognizing it's got very
serious environmental problems,

00:27:31.770 --> 00:27:35.670
is saying we actually can't
just stop that at the margin.

00:27:35.670 --> 00:27:39.350
We've got to change the
way we run our economy.

00:27:39.350 --> 00:27:42.390
And so in March this
year, next month,

00:27:42.390 --> 00:27:44.780
China will approve its
next five-year plan.

00:27:44.780 --> 00:27:48.250
And the question is,
just how bold will it be?

00:27:48.250 --> 00:27:50.027
We know quite a bit
already about it.

00:27:50.027 --> 00:27:52.360
But one of the things, for
example, we'll be looking at,

00:27:52.360 --> 00:27:55.380
is will China continue
to be the world

00:27:55.380 --> 00:27:57.720
leader in renewable energy?

00:27:57.720 --> 00:28:03.640
China already last year
invested $101 billion,

00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:08.760
which in the United States,
we invested $40 billion here.

00:28:08.760 --> 00:28:10.960
And Europe invested $45 billion.

00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:15.230
So China is twice
the level already.

00:28:15.230 --> 00:28:17.450
And we think they're
going to become even more

00:28:17.450 --> 00:28:22.160
ambitious because they believe
in this very, very strongly.

00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:25.290
So too, watch for what
they're doing on coal.

00:28:25.290 --> 00:28:27.630
This may not seem
interesting to you.

00:28:27.630 --> 00:28:31.080
But in terms of the
world and sustainability,

00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:34.200
China's coal is
unbelievably important.

00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:36.479
And the question is,
when will it peak?

00:28:36.479 --> 00:28:38.020
And the last two
years, it's actually

00:28:38.020 --> 00:28:39.280
been falling a little bit.

00:28:39.280 --> 00:28:40.405
So that's very encouraging.

00:28:40.405 --> 00:28:43.170
So they're actually
using less coal today

00:28:43.170 --> 00:28:45.130
than they used two
and a half years ago.

00:28:45.130 --> 00:28:48.650
And it may well be that it's
now on a downward pattern.

00:28:48.650 --> 00:28:53.115
They've already declared
a number of cities

00:28:53.115 --> 00:28:55.100
to be banned for coal.

00:28:55.100 --> 00:28:57.770
And the question is, whether
they'll put more caps on it

00:28:57.770 --> 00:29:00.290
or whether they'll instruct
their banking system to stop

00:29:00.290 --> 00:29:03.100
lending so much money for coal.

00:29:03.100 --> 00:29:06.450
So too, as you may know,
just as we in this country

00:29:06.450 --> 00:29:09.780
decided not to have a cap and
trade system-- do you remember?

00:29:09.780 --> 00:29:12.120
The Congress was
not ready for it.

00:29:12.120 --> 00:29:16.100
China is implementing one as
announced that by next year,

00:29:16.100 --> 00:29:19.130
we'll have a nationwide cap
and trade system on carbon.

00:29:19.130 --> 00:29:23.290
And it's doing some pilots now
in seven cities and provinces.

00:29:23.290 --> 00:29:26.490
This year, we will
learn a lot about that.

00:29:26.490 --> 00:29:30.430
And finally in China, in many
ways, the most important thing

00:29:30.430 --> 00:29:34.220
of all will be, how
will they change the way

00:29:34.220 --> 00:29:35.890
they manage their cities?

00:29:35.890 --> 00:29:38.150
Chinese cities have been
growing very rapidly

00:29:38.150 --> 00:29:40.660
just like they are in India
and they will in Africa.

00:29:40.660 --> 00:29:42.980
And the way they expand
is by selling land

00:29:42.980 --> 00:29:46.000
further and further
out into the suburbs.

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:48.430
And as a result of that,
people can take two or three

00:29:48.430 --> 00:29:49.880
hours to get to work.

00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:53.810
And they lose 10% of their city
income just due to incongestion

00:29:53.810 --> 00:29:57.210
and another 10%
due to pollution.

00:29:57.210 --> 00:29:59.830
And so that's the terrible
drag on the economy.

00:29:59.830 --> 00:30:02.546
It's a drag on society as well.

00:30:02.546 --> 00:30:04.170
And now China is
saying, wait a minute.

00:30:04.170 --> 00:30:05.400
That doesn't make any sense.

00:30:05.400 --> 00:30:07.310
Let's see if we can
do it differently.

00:30:07.310 --> 00:30:10.100
Let's design cities
around people, rather than

00:30:10.100 --> 00:30:12.160
around automobiles.

00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:16.630
And let's see if we can learn
for some modern city thinking.

00:30:16.630 --> 00:30:21.290
And so the building stock in
China will triple by 2030.

00:30:21.290 --> 00:30:24.920
So there's lots
of opportunities.

00:30:24.920 --> 00:30:26.750
In the case of India,
it will quadruple.

00:30:26.750 --> 00:30:28.960
So there's still
time to get it right,

00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:32.580
but there's a real danger
of serious lock in.

00:30:32.580 --> 00:30:34.780
So that's the story for China.

00:30:34.780 --> 00:30:37.090
Will it rebalance its economy?

00:30:37.090 --> 00:30:41.300
And in 2016, we will
learn a lot about China,

00:30:41.300 --> 00:30:43.380
and the stakes are very high.

00:30:43.380 --> 00:30:47.690
The final story has to be
about the United States.

00:30:47.690 --> 00:30:51.590
Will the United
States continue to be

00:30:51.590 --> 00:30:53.670
a leader on climate change.

00:30:53.670 --> 00:30:56.936
And some very good things have
happened recently as you know.

00:30:56.936 --> 00:31:01.840
Very surprisingly, the Congress
approved continued investment

00:31:01.840 --> 00:31:03.380
tax credits for solar.

00:31:03.380 --> 00:31:04.880
And by the way,
some of the policies

00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:06.921
that they're putting in
place at the state level,

00:31:06.921 --> 00:31:11.290
Google is being a great advocate
of, green tariffs, and so on.

00:31:11.290 --> 00:31:15.300
This is actually a very,
very important development.

00:31:15.300 --> 00:31:18.710
So too, the United
States, the federal level

00:31:18.710 --> 00:31:24.200
has put a stay, a pause, on
coal from state-owned land,

00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:26.340
the Bureau of Land Management.

00:31:26.340 --> 00:31:27.760
This is a very important thing.

00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:30.990
40% of all the coal
in this country

00:31:30.990 --> 00:31:33.535
is dug up on federal land.

00:31:33.535 --> 00:31:35.410
And a lot of people
would say, wait a minute.

00:31:35.410 --> 00:31:37.750
Does that make sense
when we're trying to move

00:31:37.750 --> 00:31:40.180
towards a healthier future?

00:31:40.180 --> 00:31:43.480
And of course, the
Clean Power Plant plan

00:31:43.480 --> 00:31:47.620
was finalized last year, which
is a very, very dramatic policy

00:31:47.620 --> 00:31:50.080
introduced by President Obama.

00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:52.350
And that enabled
the United States

00:31:52.350 --> 00:31:57.240
to announce some very ambitious
goals with regard to greenhouse

00:31:57.240 --> 00:32:00.320
gas emissions-- 26% to 28%.

00:32:00.320 --> 00:32:07.210
But two weeks ago, the Supreme
Court said, wait a minute.

00:32:07.210 --> 00:32:09.630
Since there are so many
suits against the EPA

00:32:09.630 --> 00:32:12.850
coming from states, nobody
needs to do anything

00:32:12.850 --> 00:32:14.710
until we decide on this.

00:32:14.710 --> 00:32:16.960
So this decision was
the very last one

00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:20.030
that Justice Scalia made.

00:32:20.030 --> 00:32:22.490
And on this particular issue,
he was on the wrong side

00:32:22.490 --> 00:32:23.910
by the way.

00:32:23.910 --> 00:32:28.880
He was not a friend necessarily
to President Obama's

00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:30.760
environmental policy.

00:32:30.760 --> 00:32:35.060
So this is rather up in the
air right now, quite frankly.

00:32:35.060 --> 00:32:39.220
27 states are suing
the federal government

00:32:39.220 --> 00:32:40.690
at the moment over this issue.

00:32:40.690 --> 00:32:45.100
And why does the Clean
Power Plant rule matter?

00:32:45.100 --> 00:32:47.470
It matters because
for the first time

00:32:47.470 --> 00:32:50.470
ever power plants
are going to have

00:32:50.470 --> 00:32:54.150
to measure their greenhouse
gas emissions and limit it.

00:32:54.150 --> 00:32:58.020
And that means really
sort of a very grim future

00:32:58.020 --> 00:32:59.840
for coal-- so 27 states.

00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:03.580
Now, before the Supreme
Court made its decision,

00:33:03.580 --> 00:33:06.400
38 of those states were
actually still preparing

00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:10.581
for this rule, which would have
pretty important implications.

00:33:10.581 --> 00:33:12.580
Now a number of those are
saying, wait a minute.

00:33:12.580 --> 00:33:13.630
We don't need to.

00:33:13.630 --> 00:33:14.870
So they're backing off.

00:33:14.870 --> 00:33:17.320
And some states though,
including your own,

00:33:17.320 --> 00:33:18.290
are saying, not at all.

00:33:18.290 --> 00:33:20.450
We are going to
press on with this.

00:33:20.450 --> 00:33:22.860
And New York state and
several others are saying,

00:33:22.860 --> 00:33:25.220
we believe this is
good for our citizens.

00:33:25.220 --> 00:33:27.930
So there's a lot to play
for on this by the way.

00:33:27.930 --> 00:33:31.320
And it's a very,
very important issue.

00:33:31.320 --> 00:33:33.690
Related to this-- and
I say this because I

00:33:33.690 --> 00:33:36.100
know there are some of you
from the energy business here,

00:33:36.100 --> 00:33:38.260
and others might not
be so interested.

00:33:38.260 --> 00:33:41.340
How US utilities
respond is actually

00:33:41.340 --> 00:33:43.960
a very, very interesting
issue this year.

00:33:43.960 --> 00:33:46.960
We're working on this issue
with a number of utilities

00:33:46.960 --> 00:33:48.590
and a number of purchasers.

00:33:48.590 --> 00:33:51.460
And obviously, Google is one
of the most important ones

00:33:51.460 --> 00:33:57.120
of all, signed up to a project
that we call the Clean Buyers

00:33:57.120 --> 00:33:57.930
Club.

00:33:57.930 --> 00:34:01.450
And so the question
is, will utilities

00:34:01.450 --> 00:34:03.920
come into the 21st century?

00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:05.690
Electricity utilities
have traditionally

00:34:05.690 --> 00:34:09.209
been very, very
conservative institutions.

00:34:09.209 --> 00:34:10.750
And they are going
to have to change.

00:34:10.750 --> 00:34:12.360
And the question
is, are we going

00:34:12.360 --> 00:34:14.780
to see progress
even although we've

00:34:14.780 --> 00:34:18.480
had this delay in the
Clean Power Plant rule.

00:34:18.480 --> 00:34:22.630
In June, the Court of Appeals
is set to hear the cases,

00:34:22.630 --> 00:34:25.900
but it won't be decided at
the Supreme Court for at least

00:34:25.900 --> 00:34:27.270
a year after that.

00:34:27.270 --> 00:34:29.610
So this is a delay
that's important.

00:34:29.610 --> 00:34:32.270
It's not the end of the
world, but it is nonetheless

00:34:32.270 --> 00:34:33.980
quite important.

00:34:33.980 --> 00:34:38.780
And related to this is how
the world responds to this.

00:34:38.780 --> 00:34:41.230
If you read, for example,
"The New York Times,"

00:34:41.230 --> 00:34:44.120
Delay of the Clean
Power Plant Stokes Worry

00:34:44.120 --> 00:34:46.659
About the Paris Climate Treaty.

00:34:46.659 --> 00:34:49.409
There's a, Blow to Emissions
Efforts May Imperil

00:34:49.409 --> 00:34:50.889
the Paris Climate Accord.

00:34:50.889 --> 00:34:53.389
We are talking to a lot of
developing countries now

00:34:53.389 --> 00:34:54.679
saying, relax.

00:34:54.679 --> 00:34:55.659
It's not so bad.

00:34:55.659 --> 00:34:56.460
Don't worry.

00:34:56.460 --> 00:34:58.910
You were right to trust
the United States.

00:34:58.910 --> 00:35:01.790
This is just sort of a
delay, but nonetheless this

00:35:01.790 --> 00:35:04.930
is something we have to monitor
because the entire Paris

00:35:04.930 --> 00:35:10.200
climate deal depends precisely
upon trust and mutuality.

00:35:10.200 --> 00:35:11.970
And so it's very
important that we're

00:35:11.970 --> 00:35:16.980
able to show that the others
should continue to be ambitious

00:35:16.980 --> 00:35:20.820
because the United States will
in time be able to be ambitious

00:35:20.820 --> 00:35:21.820
as well.

00:35:21.820 --> 00:35:25.260
What to watch for also this
year is, will President Obama

00:35:25.260 --> 00:35:29.400
in the remaining
months, will he continue

00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:33.030
to do things that he
believes are right

00:35:33.030 --> 00:35:36.430
even though many in
the opposition party

00:35:36.430 --> 00:35:37.270
don't think so?

00:35:37.270 --> 00:35:39.600
And so there are a number
of executive actions--

00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:42.150
we spend a lot of
time analyzing these--

00:35:42.150 --> 00:35:45.150
that could be made that
could actually improve

00:35:45.150 --> 00:35:46.560
the situation quite a bit.

00:35:46.560 --> 00:35:48.800
And we list some of them there.

00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:52.970
And finally this year,
watch out for what

00:35:52.970 --> 00:35:55.810
these guys talk
about with regard

00:35:55.810 --> 00:35:58.730
to sustainability
and climate change.

00:35:58.730 --> 00:36:00.610
These two talk about it a lot.

00:36:00.610 --> 00:36:04.500
These ones don't talk
about it so much.

00:36:04.500 --> 00:36:07.240
In fact, it's not
entirely their fault.

00:36:07.240 --> 00:36:12.260
Five days after the Paris
climate deal was signed,

00:36:12.260 --> 00:36:16.840
there was a Republican
debate hosted

00:36:16.840 --> 00:36:21.720
by CNN and not a single
question about climate change.

00:36:21.720 --> 00:36:24.350
And that's really not
good enough, we think.

00:36:24.350 --> 00:36:28.560
We think these guys ought
to be addressing it.

00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:34.300
And so too, the final slide is,
what will happen in November?

00:36:34.300 --> 00:36:40.450
Will we see a nation that really
understands that the future is

00:36:40.450 --> 00:36:47.990
about a greener, cleaner,
more efficient, more socially

00:36:47.990 --> 00:36:51.780
friendly future?

00:36:51.780 --> 00:36:53.360
Or will it not?

00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:56.590
And over the last
three or four years,

00:36:56.590 --> 00:37:00.120
there's been an amazing
intellectual breakthrough

00:37:00.120 --> 00:37:04.790
with regard to a recognition
that you can grow your economy

00:37:04.790 --> 00:37:07.750
and address
environmental problems.

00:37:07.750 --> 00:37:10.500
And indeed, addressing
environmental problems

00:37:10.500 --> 00:37:13.320
will actually help
you grow your economy.

00:37:13.320 --> 00:37:16.080
Google sits at the
heart of this debate

00:37:16.080 --> 00:37:18.520
and, better than almost
any country and any company

00:37:18.520 --> 00:37:20.930
on the planet, has the
ability to articulate

00:37:20.930 --> 00:37:22.420
what this is all about.

00:37:22.420 --> 00:37:24.680
And that's why we really
love having the partnership

00:37:24.680 --> 00:37:25.349
with you.

00:37:25.349 --> 00:37:26.140
Thank you, Rebecca.

00:37:26.140 --> 00:37:27.390
And thank you, all of you.

00:37:27.390 --> 00:37:30.449
Now you can rebut.

00:37:30.449 --> 00:37:32.421
[APPLAUSE]

00:37:36.720 --> 00:37:39.810
AUDIENCE: I mean it's obviously
embedded in all of these.

00:37:39.810 --> 00:37:41.600
I think it's difficult
to tell anyone

00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:45.292
in the world you
can't have babies.

00:37:45.292 --> 00:37:46.500
That's kind of a human right.

00:37:46.500 --> 00:37:50.350
In a way, I think it is, but
it's also a huge problem.

00:37:50.350 --> 00:37:54.879
I just wonder what WRI's and
your opinion is about that.

00:37:54.879 --> 00:37:56.170
ANDREW STEER: Well, look, Abby.

00:37:56.170 --> 00:37:56.880
You're right.

00:37:56.880 --> 00:38:00.130
It is totally a human right.

00:38:00.130 --> 00:38:03.030
The sort of median
expectations now

00:38:03.030 --> 00:38:07.760
are that population will
rise to 9.6 billion by 2050.

00:38:07.760 --> 00:38:12.160
And when I said food intake
will have to increase by 70%,

00:38:12.160 --> 00:38:14.030
it's partly that.

00:38:14.030 --> 00:38:16.680
It's partly also that
another three billion

00:38:16.680 --> 00:38:18.150
will enter the middle class.

00:38:18.150 --> 00:38:19.700
And when you enter
the middle class,

00:38:19.700 --> 00:38:22.030
you change your eating habits.

00:38:22.030 --> 00:38:24.560
You eat a lot more
meat and so on.

00:38:24.560 --> 00:38:26.490
And so yes, it is.

00:38:26.490 --> 00:38:35.120
But our view would be that
educate women, girls, girls

00:38:35.120 --> 00:38:40.590
and women, and that is the
most effective way together

00:38:40.590 --> 00:38:45.930
with ensuring adequate
services are provided.

00:38:45.930 --> 00:38:48.230
I think the world has lost
the weight a little bit

00:38:48.230 --> 00:38:51.230
on population over
the last 15 years.

00:38:51.230 --> 00:38:52.950
And one of the
reasons for that is

00:38:52.950 --> 00:38:55.700
that many of the countries
that were very much part

00:38:55.700 --> 00:38:59.100
of the debate now have problems
of too little population

00:38:59.100 --> 00:38:59.820
growth.

00:38:59.820 --> 00:39:02.360
And so there's a number
of rich countries now

00:39:02.360 --> 00:39:06.140
that are deeply troubled
by declining populations.

00:39:06.140 --> 00:39:08.170
And if there's one
thing more difficult,

00:39:08.170 --> 00:39:10.840
if your an economic manager
of a country, one thing

00:39:10.840 --> 00:39:13.250
more difficult than a very
rapidly rising population,

00:39:13.250 --> 00:39:14.480
it's declining populations.

00:39:14.480 --> 00:39:16.870
It just does not
work because you

00:39:16.870 --> 00:39:20.520
get dependency ratios of too
many old people and so on.

00:39:20.520 --> 00:39:23.360
And so it's a real problem.

00:39:23.360 --> 00:39:24.950
So I totally agree.

00:39:24.950 --> 00:39:28.270
This is a big issue.

00:39:28.270 --> 00:39:30.500
Because there are other
groups that work on this,

00:39:30.500 --> 00:39:33.330
we don't have
specifically a program.

00:39:33.330 --> 00:39:36.890
But in our major flagship
document this year,

00:39:36.890 --> 00:39:39.890
which was on the
future of food, we

00:39:39.890 --> 00:39:44.525
had a whole chapter on why
population growth matters.

00:39:44.525 --> 00:39:46.900
AUDIENCE: I think this probably
fits into building cities

00:39:46.900 --> 00:39:48.910
around people, not cars.

00:39:48.910 --> 00:39:51.050
But I'm curious if you
can share some stories

00:39:51.050 --> 00:39:54.640
around transportation
and maybe some light

00:39:54.640 --> 00:39:57.480
at the end of the tunnel
of what that's looking.

00:39:57.480 --> 00:39:58.980
Any projects that
are happening that

00:39:58.980 --> 00:40:02.820
will help transform some
of that [INAUDIBLE].

00:40:02.820 --> 00:40:04.140
ANDREW STEER: Yes.

00:40:04.140 --> 00:40:08.170
We have quite a large
transportation program

00:40:08.170 --> 00:40:14.010
in about 40 cities in
the emerging world.

00:40:14.010 --> 00:40:16.770
There have been some revolutions
that don't sound very exciting,

00:40:16.770 --> 00:40:20.030
but actually are, for example,
bus rapid transit, which

00:40:20.030 --> 00:40:22.540
is when you take
up part of the road

00:40:22.540 --> 00:40:25.680
and you protect it for buses.

00:40:25.680 --> 00:40:30.450
In places like Mexico City,
even Shanghai now, Bangalore,

00:40:30.450 --> 00:40:32.020
places like that,
you're actually

00:40:32.020 --> 00:40:34.210
seeing amazing impacts.

00:40:34.210 --> 00:40:36.580
Now 200 cities have that.

00:40:36.580 --> 00:40:40.820
And what we show is that
it costs about 1/10 what

00:40:40.820 --> 00:40:44.600
an underground metro
would cost but has

00:40:44.600 --> 00:40:49.640
90% of the benefits in
terms of time saved.

00:40:49.640 --> 00:40:51.480
And what we've seen
in Mexico City,

00:40:51.480 --> 00:40:55.720
for example, where poor people
are living on the periphery.

00:40:55.720 --> 00:40:58.430
Took 3 hours to get to work
in the morning, three hours

00:40:58.430 --> 00:40:59.420
to get home.

00:40:59.420 --> 00:41:02.220
So they had to leave at like
5 o'clock in the morning,

00:41:02.220 --> 00:41:04.382
didn't get home till
9 o'clock at night.

00:41:04.382 --> 00:41:06.215
Never saw their children,
couldn't help them

00:41:06.215 --> 00:41:07.270
with their homework.

00:41:07.270 --> 00:41:09.380
I mean really sort of
tragic that we've now

00:41:09.380 --> 00:41:12.550
seen that cut by almost
an hour just introducing

00:41:12.550 --> 00:41:14.980
some modern techniques.

00:41:14.980 --> 00:41:18.410
But at the end of the day,
these are political choices

00:41:18.410 --> 00:41:23.050
as to whether or not leaders
have the courage to say,

00:41:23.050 --> 00:41:26.970
I'm going to put money into
public transportation that

00:41:26.970 --> 00:41:29.040
benefits all the citizens.

00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:33.300
Or am I going to put it in roads
that, in developing countries,

00:41:33.300 --> 00:41:35.040
benefit the top 10%.

00:41:35.040 --> 00:41:37.230
So you've got this real
tragedy in many countries

00:41:37.230 --> 00:41:40.960
where you see people sitting
in air-conditioned cars

00:41:40.960 --> 00:41:41.920
going down the street.

00:41:41.920 --> 00:41:44.150
Although now, they're
being stuck in traffic,

00:41:44.150 --> 00:41:47.340
while the poor people are having
to change buses four times.

00:41:47.340 --> 00:41:49.840
And the buses get stuck
just the same way,

00:41:49.840 --> 00:41:52.270
so they take even longer.

00:41:52.270 --> 00:41:54.140
Very interesting
question will be--

00:41:54.140 --> 00:41:56.690
and it's hotly debated
among environmentalists--

00:41:56.690 --> 00:41:59.380
is self-driving cars,
which obviously Google

00:41:59.380 --> 00:42:01.330
is the leader in.

00:42:01.330 --> 00:42:04.990
The question is from
sustainability standpoint,

00:42:04.990 --> 00:42:06.320
good or bad?

00:42:06.320 --> 00:42:09.920
It's good, clearly, in that cars
will move more smoothly, more

00:42:09.920 --> 00:42:12.440
efficiently, and
obviously in a much less

00:42:12.440 --> 00:42:14.910
polluting sort of way,
less stopping and starting.

00:42:14.910 --> 00:42:17.687
And of course, that will
be electric in time.

00:42:17.687 --> 00:42:19.270
But some are saying,
well, is it going

00:42:19.270 --> 00:42:23.350
to get in the way of
public transportation.

00:42:23.350 --> 00:42:25.190
I don't think it needs
to at all actually.

00:42:25.190 --> 00:42:26.930
I mean I think
there should still

00:42:26.930 --> 00:42:29.560
be a way of combining the two.

00:42:29.560 --> 00:42:35.590
But there does need to be
the kind of bold action

00:42:35.590 --> 00:42:40.660
that cities like London
took, where, for example-- I

00:42:40.660 --> 00:42:41.770
grew up in London.

00:42:41.770 --> 00:42:44.360
I used to drive into
London all the time,

00:42:44.360 --> 00:42:45.790
all ride into central London.

00:42:45.790 --> 00:42:47.336
That's how we used to get there.

00:42:47.336 --> 00:42:51.910
And about 15 years ago,
the government said,

00:42:51.910 --> 00:42:54.959
we're going to charge to go
into the middle of London.

00:42:54.959 --> 00:42:56.500
We're going to charge
electronically.

00:42:56.500 --> 00:42:59.460
So as you pass through
this, you get eight pounds

00:42:59.460 --> 00:43:01.320
taken off your credit card.

00:43:01.320 --> 00:43:03.340
Interestingly, that's
not very much money.

00:43:03.340 --> 00:43:05.980
It's not the money
that changes this.

00:43:05.980 --> 00:43:08.670
But because of that
psychological shift--

00:43:08.670 --> 00:43:11.030
I just lived three years
in the suburb of London.

00:43:11.030 --> 00:43:13.590
Never once in that three
years did I drive into London.

00:43:13.590 --> 00:43:16.850
And I would die before I
ever drive into London again.

00:43:16.850 --> 00:43:21.310
I will never ever drive a
car in the center of London.

00:43:21.310 --> 00:43:23.707
How could that switch happen?

00:43:23.707 --> 00:43:25.040
And that's what needs to happen.

00:43:25.040 --> 00:43:27.520
And Beijing now has
asked us to help

00:43:27.520 --> 00:43:30.420
them think through a
similar system for Beijing.

00:43:30.420 --> 00:43:32.910
And there's a lot of
complicated issues of technology

00:43:32.910 --> 00:43:36.540
and, more important, political
acceptability of course.

00:43:36.540 --> 00:43:41.030
So we're simply doing the
technical work with them,

00:43:41.030 --> 00:43:43.180
taking them to a place like
Stockholm and Singapore

00:43:43.180 --> 00:43:46.270
and London and showing
them how to do that.

00:43:46.270 --> 00:43:48.360
I understand that Mayor
Bloomberg in New York, who

00:43:48.360 --> 00:43:51.000
obviously was a
wonderful mayor-- this

00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:53.510
was the one, I
think, sort of regret

00:43:53.510 --> 00:43:57.680
that he tried to move forward
on congestion pricing,

00:43:57.680 --> 00:43:58.710
as it's called.

00:43:58.710 --> 00:44:02.040
And couldn't get the
political support for it

00:44:02.040 --> 00:44:03.430
because it is difficult.

00:44:03.430 --> 00:44:04.070
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:44:04.070 --> 00:44:07.500
On the food loss and waste,
besides the agricultural remote

00:44:07.500 --> 00:44:09.180
sensing, what
other opportunities

00:44:09.180 --> 00:44:10.992
do you see for
applications of technology?

00:44:10.992 --> 00:44:13.200
And what are some things
that us sitting in this room

00:44:13.200 --> 00:44:14.480
can be doing?

00:44:14.480 --> 00:44:15.490
ANDREW STEER: Wow.

00:44:15.490 --> 00:44:16.380
Good question.

00:44:16.380 --> 00:44:19.980
Actually, I haven't thought
about that, and I'd have to.

00:44:19.980 --> 00:44:27.740
I think for rich
countries-- Tesco

00:44:27.740 --> 00:44:30.770
just came out with its
annual statement and said,

00:44:30.770 --> 00:44:32.240
we want to come clean.

00:44:32.240 --> 00:44:37.757
55,000 tons of food in
our care was wasted.

00:44:37.757 --> 00:44:39.840
That's not when you take
it home, you don't eat it

00:44:39.840 --> 00:44:41.230
or your kids throw it away.

00:44:41.230 --> 00:44:43.837
It's within the care of Tesco.

00:44:43.837 --> 00:44:45.545
And they said, we want
to be transparent,

00:44:45.545 --> 00:44:46.920
and every year we're going to.

00:44:46.920 --> 00:44:48.590
So the question is,
what do they do?

00:44:48.590 --> 00:44:51.980
I mean they need-- which
they're doing and so is Walmart.

00:44:51.980 --> 00:44:57.790
They need very sophisticated
logistical, just-in-time

00:44:57.790 --> 00:44:59.470
inventories and so on.

00:44:59.470 --> 00:45:01.830
I mean there's just lots
of tricks that they do.

00:45:01.830 --> 00:45:08.400
So to the extent that that
requires the kind of high tech

00:45:08.400 --> 00:45:12.780
sophisticated support
that a company like Google

00:45:12.780 --> 00:45:15.970
could provide, that's one.

00:45:15.970 --> 00:45:18.440
With regard to
developing countries,

00:45:18.440 --> 00:45:23.530
I think that-- I mean the
issue there is for 20-30 years,

00:45:23.530 --> 00:45:26.190
we've all known that it's
a terrible, terrible waste

00:45:26.190 --> 00:45:29.720
to see these poor farmers
slaving and getting

00:45:29.720 --> 00:45:31.600
yields which are not very high.

00:45:31.600 --> 00:45:33.360
And then half of
the food sometimes

00:45:33.360 --> 00:45:35.640
is lost simply because
they don't have storage.

00:45:35.640 --> 00:45:40.820
There are new technologies now
that enable that to be kept.

00:45:40.820 --> 00:45:44.850
And of course, the existence
of distributed power

00:45:44.850 --> 00:45:48.320
enables for certain crops'
power to be used just

00:45:48.320 --> 00:45:51.090
to keep the temperature a
little bit cooler, which

00:45:51.090 --> 00:45:58.460
can dramatically affect the
sustainability of the food

00:45:58.460 --> 00:45:59.960
for another month or so.

00:45:59.960 --> 00:46:00.960
Do you know what I mean?

00:46:00.960 --> 00:46:02.860
And then obviously, the
more sophisticated crops

00:46:02.860 --> 00:46:04.030
is all about cold storage.

00:46:04.030 --> 00:46:05.710
And there, again,
that comes into it.

00:46:05.710 --> 00:46:08.470
But the prediction--
I mean remote sensing

00:46:08.470 --> 00:46:11.320
is potentially
exceedingly important.

00:46:11.320 --> 00:46:15.730
If you can see what a crop is
going to be by remote sensing

00:46:15.730 --> 00:46:19.160
before the crop is harvested--
if two months before the crop

00:46:19.160 --> 00:46:22.460
is harvested you know it's
going to be a bumper crop,

00:46:22.460 --> 00:46:23.917
that has all kinds
of implications

00:46:23.917 --> 00:46:25.500
of how you're going
to store your food

00:46:25.500 --> 00:46:27.208
and how you're going
to get it to market.

00:46:27.208 --> 00:46:29.166
And it enables you
to get a start-- do

00:46:29.166 --> 00:46:31.430
you know what I mean-- to
get us a start on things.

00:46:31.430 --> 00:46:35.479
So there are some exciting
possibilities I think.

00:46:35.479 --> 00:46:36.020
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:46:36.020 --> 00:46:37.840
Thanks for speaking today.

00:46:37.840 --> 00:46:39.900
I think that major
players in sustainability

00:46:39.900 --> 00:46:43.360
are continually seeing
issues like social justice

00:46:43.360 --> 00:46:46.480
and public health
as really being

00:46:46.480 --> 00:46:48.840
central to environmental
sustainability, whereas that's

00:46:48.840 --> 00:46:50.880
been a little bit more
segmented in the past.

00:46:50.880 --> 00:46:53.847
And I wanted to know where you
think our key points of overlap

00:46:53.847 --> 00:46:55.430
that are going to
be really important,

00:46:55.430 --> 00:46:57.230
not just for environmental
sustainability,

00:46:57.230 --> 00:46:59.271
but issues of public
health, where we can sort of

00:46:59.271 --> 00:47:02.002
kill two birds with one stone.

00:47:02.002 --> 00:47:03.460
ANDREW STEER: Well,
I think, I mean

00:47:03.460 --> 00:47:08.120
if there's one truth
about environmental damage

00:47:08.120 --> 00:47:11.890
is that, in almost
all situations--

00:47:11.890 --> 00:47:14.354
air pollution may be
an exception-- it hurts

00:47:14.354 --> 00:47:15.520
the poor more than the rich.

00:47:15.520 --> 00:47:18.660
In most environmental
problems, the rich

00:47:18.660 --> 00:47:22.750
are able, one way or the other,
to buy their way out of it.

00:47:22.750 --> 00:47:26.440
So most cities, if
you look at them,

00:47:26.440 --> 00:47:31.220
historically, the poor people
live downwind and down river

00:47:31.220 --> 00:47:32.010
often.

00:47:32.010 --> 00:47:35.640
So in London-- say, my city,
but it's true of all cities--

00:47:35.640 --> 00:47:37.970
east end of London,
always the poor area.

00:47:37.970 --> 00:47:39.330
West end of London?

00:47:39.330 --> 00:47:40.040
Rich people.

00:47:40.040 --> 00:47:40.540
Why?

00:47:40.540 --> 00:47:43.280
Because the west end of
London, air is cleaner,

00:47:43.280 --> 00:47:44.660
water is cleaner, and so on.

00:47:44.660 --> 00:47:45.660
Do you know what I mean?

00:47:45.660 --> 00:47:47.460
I'll pollute you down.

00:47:47.460 --> 00:47:50.910
There's a general truth
that if you address

00:47:50.910 --> 00:47:55.260
environmental issues smartly,
you will benefit the poor

00:47:55.260 --> 00:47:58.240
and you will advance the
cause of social justice.

00:47:58.240 --> 00:48:01.640
And climate change is
clearly the case in point--

00:48:01.640 --> 00:48:03.020
the most dramatic case.

00:48:03.020 --> 00:48:05.170
I mean there are
many studies now

00:48:05.170 --> 00:48:08.290
that show the impacts of
climate change on the poor

00:48:08.290 --> 00:48:10.670
will be really desperate.

00:48:10.670 --> 00:48:12.620
That's why one of
the things that we do

00:48:12.620 --> 00:48:18.680
is we run a network of
300 organizations in 50

00:48:18.680 --> 00:48:23.110
countries dedicated to
giving citizens the right

00:48:23.110 --> 00:48:24.620
to have environmental data.

00:48:24.620 --> 00:48:26.270
It's called the
Access Initiative.

00:48:26.270 --> 00:48:27.496
And we publish something.

00:48:27.496 --> 00:48:28.870
We've just started
to publish it.

00:48:28.870 --> 00:48:30.411
We're going to do
it every year, what

00:48:30.411 --> 00:48:32.710
we call an environmental
democracy index.

00:48:32.710 --> 00:48:34.870
And what that does
is it says, look,

00:48:34.870 --> 00:48:39.680
we think that everybody has
the right to know, at least,

00:48:39.680 --> 00:48:42.020
and to engage in decisions.

00:48:42.020 --> 00:48:45.450
So for example,
does a country have

00:48:45.450 --> 00:48:50.490
user-friendly data on air
pollution in the capital city?

00:48:50.490 --> 00:48:54.010
China now is a leader in that.

00:48:54.010 --> 00:48:55.900
They certainly
weren't 10 years ago.

00:48:55.900 --> 00:48:59.405
But our staff in China
wake up every morning.

00:48:59.405 --> 00:49:01.780
They check on their smartphone
what the air pollution is.

00:49:01.780 --> 00:49:04.070
And that, they decide
whether to putting a mask on

00:49:04.070 --> 00:49:06.620
to go do their
work, so to speak.

00:49:06.620 --> 00:49:11.000
So environmental democracy
means that all citizens

00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:13.220
have the right to
get information

00:49:13.220 --> 00:49:16.370
and the right to engage
in decision making.

00:49:16.370 --> 00:49:20.050
So I think the links
are incredibly close.

00:49:20.050 --> 00:49:21.800
REBECCA MOORE: I know
you have a question,

00:49:21.800 --> 00:49:24.290
but if you don't mind,
I'd like to ask one.

00:49:24.290 --> 00:49:28.640
There's a story that is in
the news about the extinction

00:49:28.640 --> 00:49:29.994
crisis.

00:49:29.994 --> 00:49:30.660
Is this working?

00:49:30.660 --> 00:49:31.970
Now it is.

00:49:31.970 --> 00:49:35.000
That there's an accelerating
loss of plant and animal

00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:38.590
species, hundreds if not
thousands of species going

00:49:38.590 --> 00:49:41.360
extinct accelerating rate.

00:49:41.360 --> 00:49:44.590
And it seems to be due to
climate change and habitat

00:49:44.590 --> 00:49:45.450
loss.

00:49:45.450 --> 00:49:48.190
I think something like
90% of endangered species

00:49:48.190 --> 00:49:49.920
are dependent on forests.

00:49:49.920 --> 00:49:52.530
And so as forests
are cut down, we

00:49:52.530 --> 00:49:54.990
are eliminating these species.

00:49:54.990 --> 00:49:58.130
E.O. Wilson is apparently coming
out with something [INAUDIBLE]

00:49:58.130 --> 00:49:59.250
50% of nature.

00:49:59.250 --> 00:50:02.040
He's like a leading biologist,
ecologist at Harvard.

00:50:02.040 --> 00:50:04.450
That the idea is we
can't save all of nature,

00:50:04.450 --> 00:50:07.410
but can we agree to
save 50% of nature

00:50:07.410 --> 00:50:09.800
and agree on where that
is and draw the line?

00:50:09.800 --> 00:50:12.852
And Eric Dinerstein of WRI I
believe is involved with this.

00:50:12.852 --> 00:50:14.560
This book is going to
come out this year.

00:50:14.560 --> 00:50:19.185
Anyway, so what is your, what
is WRI's position on all that?

00:50:19.185 --> 00:50:21.750
ANDREW STEER: That's
a brilliant question.

00:50:21.750 --> 00:50:27.820
One of the real puzzles is,
why is biodiversity and species

00:50:27.820 --> 00:50:29.940
loss not a big political issue?

00:50:29.940 --> 00:50:31.690
I mean it's really interesting.

00:50:31.690 --> 00:50:36.660
I was at the original
Rio Earth Summit in 1992.

00:50:36.660 --> 00:50:41.250
And there we saw two
treaties being signed--

00:50:41.250 --> 00:50:43.390
climate change, biodiversity.

00:50:43.390 --> 00:50:45.360
In the next five
years, biodiversity

00:50:45.360 --> 00:50:47.830
was a much hotter issue
than climate change.

00:50:47.830 --> 00:50:51.030
I mean it was really a
buzzy important issue.

00:50:51.030 --> 00:50:53.147
And in the last 15 years,
it's totally fallen

00:50:53.147 --> 00:50:54.980
off the agenda, which
is really interesting,

00:50:54.980 --> 00:50:57.146
whilst climate change
actually has done rather well.

00:50:57.146 --> 00:50:59.850
And even the stories I tell,
you notice, they're about that.

00:50:59.850 --> 00:51:03.790
So I don't know whether E.O.
Wilson's 50% is the right

00:51:03.790 --> 00:51:07.980
or not, but we absolutely
need to demonstrate

00:51:07.980 --> 00:51:10.370
how the kinds of things
we're talking about

00:51:10.370 --> 00:51:11.570
will affect biodiversity.

00:51:11.570 --> 00:51:15.360
I mean our view is, quite
frankly, that we are hoping--

00:51:15.360 --> 00:51:17.160
and we're working
with IUCN in the lead

00:51:17.160 --> 00:51:20.390
up to the big IUCN
conference in Hawaii

00:51:20.390 --> 00:51:24.060
later on this year, which
they have every three years.

00:51:24.060 --> 00:51:28.380
We're hoping to get
some more political buzz

00:51:28.380 --> 00:51:29.860
around biodiversity.

00:51:29.860 --> 00:51:34.390
But in the meantime,
quite frankly,

00:51:34.390 --> 00:51:38.770
the policies of smart
cities-- cutting food waste,

00:51:38.770 --> 00:51:43.640
addressing knowledge on forests,
addressing supply chains

00:51:43.640 --> 00:51:46.990
on palm oil and soy--
do you know what I mean?

00:51:46.990 --> 00:51:49.390
Those other ways,
practical ways,

00:51:49.390 --> 00:51:52.760
even though you don't say
that's why we're doing them.

00:51:52.760 --> 00:51:55.020
But it would be great.

00:51:55.020 --> 00:51:57.390
Eric Dinerstein is just
this wonderful fellow.

00:51:57.390 --> 00:52:02.345
And we're using Global Forest
Watch now for tiger protection.

00:52:02.345 --> 00:52:03.922
It's fabulous.

00:52:03.922 --> 00:52:05.130
That's such a great question.

00:52:05.130 --> 00:52:07.505
REBECCA MOORE: I think I have
time for one more question.

00:52:07.505 --> 00:52:09.550
You've been patiently waiting.

00:52:09.550 --> 00:52:11.070
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:52:11.070 --> 00:52:11.570
Yeah.

00:52:11.570 --> 00:52:12.580
Thanks.

00:52:12.580 --> 00:52:16.590
So I like eating meat, you know?

00:52:16.590 --> 00:52:17.420
I enjoy it.

00:52:17.420 --> 00:52:20.510
But I think I'm lucky
enough to be in a position

00:52:20.510 --> 00:52:26.270
where if I didn't have to eat
meat or meat were restricted,

00:52:26.270 --> 00:52:28.460
I would be fine not eating
meat-- being vegetarian.

00:52:31.250 --> 00:52:36.610
You mentioned food waste and
the sort of ecological impact,

00:52:36.610 --> 00:52:40.320
but I'm wondering whether the
reduction of meat consumption

00:52:40.320 --> 00:52:42.830
is something that comes
up in these conversations.

00:52:42.830 --> 00:52:46.700
I mean we know it contributes
to global warming in a huge way,

00:52:46.700 --> 00:52:49.840
especially in
affluent nations where

00:52:49.840 --> 00:52:51.957
people don't have to eat meat.

00:52:51.957 --> 00:52:53.790
Is that something that's
being talked about?

00:52:53.790 --> 00:52:55.880
Is that a part of the
conversation at all?

00:52:55.880 --> 00:52:56.671
ANDREW STEER: Yeah.

00:52:56.671 --> 00:52:59.200
So it's a really important
part of the conversation,

00:52:59.200 --> 00:53:01.820
and it's a really good question.

00:53:01.820 --> 00:53:07.550
Why do humans change
their behavior?

00:53:07.550 --> 00:53:11.460
Why do they sometimes not
change for a long time and then

00:53:11.460 --> 00:53:14.220
suddenly they will switch?

00:53:14.220 --> 00:53:19.150
And there is a very important
field of psychology,

00:53:19.150 --> 00:53:22.349
and commercial psychology,
that has learned a lot.

00:53:22.349 --> 00:53:23.890
And so what we're
doing is setting up

00:53:23.890 --> 00:53:27.630
a small lab precisely
to look at the issue of,

00:53:27.630 --> 00:53:31.930
what it would take to get
people to eat less meat?

00:53:31.930 --> 00:53:33.510
And part of that
is, for example,

00:53:33.510 --> 00:53:38.030
even if you can get the
leading providers of food

00:53:38.030 --> 00:53:41.020
in supermarkets to position
things differently,

00:53:41.020 --> 00:53:44.950
and little things like that, and
the whole science of nudge now.

00:53:44.950 --> 00:53:46.490
That's really what it's about.

00:53:46.490 --> 00:53:49.570
How do you not sort
of preach at them--

00:53:49.570 --> 00:53:51.830
I mean interestingly,
the reason there's

00:53:51.830 --> 00:53:54.950
been this massive shift
in smoking, turns out,

00:53:54.950 --> 00:53:58.680
actually, is not only or not
mainly because the government

00:53:58.680 --> 00:54:00.590
has passed rules actually.

00:54:00.590 --> 00:54:03.330
It's much more to do
with social pressure,

00:54:03.330 --> 00:54:05.690
and it's to do with nudging.

00:54:05.690 --> 00:54:06.670
It's labeling.

00:54:06.670 --> 00:54:08.100
It's all things like that.

00:54:08.100 --> 00:54:09.892
So we believe this is
very, very important.

00:54:09.892 --> 00:54:11.808
REBECCA MOORE: Well, I
think we could probably

00:54:11.808 --> 00:54:13.210
go on for another hour.

00:54:13.210 --> 00:54:15.260
You are such a font
of information.

00:54:15.260 --> 00:54:17.194
Please join me in
thanking Dr. Steer.

00:54:17.194 --> 00:54:18.610
ANDREW STEER: Thank
you very much.

00:54:18.610 --> 00:54:21.060
[APPLAUSE]
