Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.950
&gt;&gt; Moderator: Our first
presenter, Dr. Krista Lewis,

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:23.290
is an associate professor
of anthropology and chair

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:25.940
of the Department of
Sociology and Anthropology

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:29.370
at the University of
Arkansas at Little Rock.

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:32.350
She specializes in
archeology of Southern Arabia

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:35.540
and its relationships to
the wider Middle Eastern

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:37.630
and Indian Ocean regions.

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:41.200
Dr. Lewis leads two major
archeological projects

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:45.650
in South Arabia, one in
Yemen and one in Oman.

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:47.720
In Oman, she directs excavations

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:49.890
at the UNESCO World
Heritage Land

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.340
of Frankincense site
of Al-Baleed.

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:58.500
Her research engages issue
of urbanism, food waste,

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.410
resource extraction,
craft production, trade,

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:06.440
emerging globalization,
multicultural interactions

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:08.460
and sustainability
from prehistory

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.360
to the early modern period.

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.120
Dr. Lewis holds a PHD from
the Department of Anthropology

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:16.010
at the University of Chicago.

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:17.810
Please welcome Dr. Lewis.

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:21.500
[ Applause ]

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:26.910
&gt;&gt; Dr. Krista Lewis:
Al-Baleed was a mercantile,

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:28.990
administrative, and
cultural center,

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:32.120
and international port
city with a local heart.

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:35.220
This large walled city offers
a window into the emergence

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.470
of the globalized world
that we live in today.

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:40.120
Al-Baleed is a large

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:42.630
and visually stunning
archeological site stretching

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.020
for over a mile along
the Arabian Sea beach.

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.690
Its history stretches from
the Late Antique period

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:51.290
to the Early Modern, and its
transformations throughout

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:52.850
that time have much to teach us

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.500
about international
commercial transactions

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.630
and the cultural
interconnections

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:58.930
that generate and sustain them.

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:02.330
And, we heard earlier about --

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:07.780
sorry, is this -- I
hear myself loudly.

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.270
We heard early from
our speakers earlier,

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:12.310
especially Dr. Genouer
[assumed spelling] about some

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.340
of the very early origins of
globalization in this region.

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.710
So, trade and interconnection
have a very long history

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:23.670
in this area, but Al-Baleed
is a special place to look

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:28.050
at the connections between these
very ancient origins of trade

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.710
and interconnection globally all
the way up to the modern world

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:34.590
that we live in today.

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.760
So, there are many industries
and products associated

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.450
with the region during
the height of Al-Baleed,

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:45.890
including aloes, metals, beads,
textiles, ceramics, fish,

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:48.380
and the plant dyes
indigo and madder.

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.550
Most famously of course,
Al-Baleed is well-known

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:54.850
for having exported the regional
specialties of frankincense

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:57.790
and also Arabian horses.

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.150
Even more importantly, a wide
array of people and ideas

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.430
from throughout the
Indian Ocean region passed

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:05.470
through the gates of the city.

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:08.810
Just to give you a better idea
of where we're talking about,

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:11.160
I mean, you all know
where Oman is, of course.

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:15.900
But, note the southern Oman, the
Dhofar region, which is really

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:20.070
in the center of the Western
Indian Ocean trade circuits.

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:23.160
Moving, and I don't have a
pointer to show you this,

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:24.940
but maybe I could show you.

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:26.810
The reason I show
you this map is just

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:31.630
to highlight briefly the type
of geography we're looking

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:35.320
at in southern Oman,
and why it's special.

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:38.180
Each summer the Indian
Ocean monsoon brings rain

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:40.930
that turns this ring of
mountains, if you can kind

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:45.020
of see with the pointer,
green, a lush green,

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:47.720
and provides the moisture
that allows frankincense trees

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:49.020
to grow in this region.

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:50.940
So, frankincense is our only --

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:54.180
they're exploiting a very small
area along the back slopes

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:55.480
of the mountain.

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:56.780
And, you need just a certain
amount of moisture that comes

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:59.060
from this Indian Ocean Monsoon.

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:03.480
Notice also down here in this
other box where Salalah is,

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:06.350
this other area of green.

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:11.440
In this view to the north, you
can see part of the western end

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:15.100
of the walled city of
Al-Baleed and a closer view

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:18.120
of that second area of
green I pointed out.

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:21.490
It's a lush tropical
agricultural belt made possible

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:25.280
by the runoff and ground water
from those framing mountains

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:27.680
and the Indian Ocean monsoon.

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:30.400
Unlike much of Arabia which
is famous for its deserts,

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.540
Dhofar's unique environment
makes it an ideal place

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:36.770
to be able to found
and feed a city.

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:38.510
The agricultural products

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:42.310
from Salalah today are most
famously bananas and coconuts

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:44.180
and other forms of
tropical fruits.

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:46.340
But, what's even more
interesting, in the understory

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:48.920
of that orchard zone,
all sorts of plants

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:50.560
and animals are being raised,

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:52.990
so it's a really
highly productive belt.

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:55.490
So, a very special,
special place.

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:59.540
In this photo you
also see the locations

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:02.760
of the most common structures
on the site of Al-Baleed.

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:05.620
This is the impress --
there's the garden zone --

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:07.740
the citadel of Al-Baleed

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:10.490
and associated large
congregational mosque,

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:12.450
which you'll see
both of those later.

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:13.750
Am I just seeing some

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:16.390
of the other unexcavated
building mounds

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:17.690
in that [inaudible] site?

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:20.990
I'll just go ahead
while he gets those up.

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:22.740
The work of a number
of archeologists

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:26.440
at Al-Baleed has established the
basic sequence of occupation,

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:28.660
which can be bracketed
into subperiods

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:31.520
which you'd be seeing now
when the slides come up.

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:34.490
Based on the visual
architectural types,

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:38.000
radiocarbon dates, stratigraphy
-- okay, we're getting closer --

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.630
ceramic typology, coinage,
and historic narratives.

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:42.930
There you go.

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:45.910
There's our phases of the city.

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:48.840
So, from modest pre-Islamic
origins, the town grew

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:51.310
into a thriving city,
experiences a series

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:54.330
of political and economic
developments and phases

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:56.990
of reorganization,
reconstruction, and expansion

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:00.410
for well over a thousand years.

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:03.020
So, although we have structural
remnants and artifacts

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:04.790
from Late Antiquity,
what you see

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:08.660
in the upper righthand corner
that have been excavated

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:11.400
at Al-Baleed, due to the
intensive history of building

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:12.700
and rebuilding at this site,

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:15.610
exposure to these earlier
materials are necessarily

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:17.080
rather limited.

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:20.480
In this example in the
upper righthand corner,

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:25.720
you see some Late Antique
bezels and also some house walls

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:29.140
which are buried
meters below a mosque,

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:31.170
which is also below
another mosque.

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:34.070
So, you can't just
kind of remove all

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:36.120
of these later periods
to get down to the early.

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:40.430
The photo at the bottom
is the ground level view

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:43.010
of the mosque you saw
in the last slide.

00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:46.320
It was founded by or before
about the mid-tenth century AD,

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:49.300
and saw a series of remodelings
over the history of the town,

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:51.000
as most buildings did.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.910
This mosque had a flat
roof, a central courtyard,

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:59.500
a quart minaret, and an attached
ablution facility in the back.

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:02.630
Across the city, more than
50 other mosques have been

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:05.870
identified, many
small and square,

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:11.790
most of which probably date
between 1250 and 1400 AD.

00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:14.510
This citadel which you also
saw in that overview shot,

00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:17.020
is the most prominent
monument on site.

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:19.730
Also has seen a series of
rebuilds, enlargements,

00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:21.580
and increased fortifications
from the tenth

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:23.490
to the 16th centuries.

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:27.750
It rose to at least four stories
and had an interior courtyard.

00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:31.250
Iben Betutu wrote in 1340
AD that it was the residence

00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:33.790
of a sultan, highlighting
Al-Baleed's importance

00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:37.530
as an administrative
center for the region.

00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:40.160
The south-facing view,
also the citadel,

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:42.470
highlights the lagoon
surrounding the site

00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:45.500
and its importance for
defense as well as a source

00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:46.950
of fresh water for the site.

00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:50.320
So, those runoff coming from
the mountains, across a lot

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:53.000
of the Salalah Plain, you
don't actually see the water.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.610
I mean, there are
springs, but in a lot

00:07:54.610 --> 00:07:56.480
of areas you don't see the
water, but right when you get

00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:58.650
to the sea where
these drainages occur,

00:07:58.650 --> 00:08:01.060
you get these freshwater lagoons
which have been important

00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:04.570
in settlement in Oman, you
know, since deepest Antiquity,

00:08:04.570 --> 00:08:08.880
but certainly right up the
period of use of this site.

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:11.150
This is an artist's
reconstruction

00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:14.170
of almost the same
view and the lagoons

00:08:14.170 --> 00:08:16.040
around the site could
also provide a route

00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:18.170
of transport by boat.

00:08:18.170 --> 00:08:22.280
Al-Baleed's most impressive
defenses face the sea.

00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:24.310
The south city wall
includes a series

00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:30.290
of red [inaudible] base massive
towers, which you can see here,

00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:32.370
and also in all these views.

00:08:32.370 --> 00:08:34.880
But, up close and
an aerial view.

00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:42.180
The city also has a number of
monumental city gates as well

00:08:42.180 --> 00:08:45.750
as other less grand entrances
placed around the city wall.

00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:48.300
There's also evidence for
locations where boats moored

00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:51.030
for offloading and taking
on goods and supplies.

00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:53.690
For example, the small
gate, which seems like it's

00:08:53.690 --> 00:08:56.250
up in the air from the
city wall shown here,

00:08:56.250 --> 00:08:59.190
probably had a wooden
pier that you would step

00:08:59.190 --> 00:09:01.490
to reach the gate from.

00:09:04.110 --> 00:09:05.540
The impressive archeological --

00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:07.390
architectural features
certainly speak

00:09:07.390 --> 00:09:10.480
to significant local
political and economic power,

00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:13.310
but a really wide array
of imported good excavated

00:09:13.310 --> 00:09:14.830
from Al-Baleed also
provide evidence

00:09:14.830 --> 00:09:17.790
for its far-flung
global connections.

00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:21.070
Ceramics, coinage, and a
variety of other artifacts

00:09:21.070 --> 00:09:24.680
from Al-Baleed include
material of the origins of Yemen

00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:31.280
and East Africa, from Egypt,
northern Middle East and Persia,

00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:36.290
from India, wider South Asia,
Southeast Asia and China.

00:09:36.290 --> 00:09:38.810
Glass and wood have also
been found at the site

00:09:38.810 --> 00:09:41.970
from multiple origins
across the Indian Ocean.

00:09:45.210 --> 00:09:48.510
In six seasons of work since
2013, my team has been working

00:09:48.510 --> 00:09:51.210
to add a new dimension to
our knowledge of the site.

00:09:51.210 --> 00:09:52.530
Our research at Al-Baleed seeks

00:09:52.530 --> 00:09:54.980
to understand the daily
activities of the people

00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:58.160
who lived and did business
there, examining the patterns

00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:01.720
of urban life as they developed
uniquely in Southern Arabia

00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:03.020
in the context

00:10:03.020 --> 00:10:05.410
of its far-reaching
global trade connections.

00:10:05.410 --> 00:10:07.630
Our work focuses on two
different sets of methods

00:10:07.630 --> 00:10:09.460
over a range of scales.

00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:11.950
One is very tactile,
traditional excavation,

00:10:11.950 --> 00:10:14.870
looking at the spaces where
people lived and worked,

00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:17.630
what they did, and who they
were through the minute

00:10:17.630 --> 00:10:19.620
of their material cultural.

00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:22.230
The other dimension is high
tech involving detailed mapping

00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:24.310
on the ground and from
the air, as you see here,

00:10:24.310 --> 00:10:26.930
and then using the
digital data gathered

00:10:26.930 --> 00:10:30.450
to create three-dimensional
models.

00:10:30.450 --> 00:10:33.580
This image is of a model
of the entire site created

00:10:33.580 --> 00:10:35.650
from a composite of
air photographs taken

00:10:35.650 --> 00:10:37.040
with an unmanned aerial vehicle.

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:39.020
It can be zoomed to a level

00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:41.210
where individual
stones are visible.

00:10:41.210 --> 00:10:44.560
It's not easy to demonstrate
that in a static slide show,

00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:48.160
but here's an example of one of
the images and that's actually

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:49.840
at reduced quality there.

00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:52.570
This is a funerary mosque
in the middle of the site.

00:10:52.570 --> 00:10:55.640
You can zoom it in and
see individual stones.

00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:58.160
You can clearly see the
individual surviving graves,

00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:03.350
so this is going to allow us to
make a very high quality map.

00:11:03.350 --> 00:11:06.300
This is false color
elevation model

00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:08.790
and so it makes it a
little gaudy, but this kind

00:11:08.790 --> 00:11:10.180
of visualization allows us

00:11:10.180 --> 00:11:12.020
to see beyond what
can be discerned just

00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:13.610
from a photograph.

00:11:13.610 --> 00:11:18.300
We use image analysis to discern
buildings, neighborhoods,

00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:21.700
courtyards, streets, and
maybe even industrial areas

00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:25.190
in a way that's identifiable
more than they are

00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:28.310
when you're actually on
site, on foot on the ground.

00:11:28.310 --> 00:11:32.670
So, this is allowing us to
make a better, more, I guess,

00:11:32.670 --> 00:11:36.780
analytical map of site and then
also identify areas targeted

00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:38.080
for future excavation.

00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:41.520
It also allows us to know
things about the site

00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:43.800
without excavation which
is an important aspect

00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:45.720
of site preservation.

00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:48.350
How the city was organized
is an important aspect

00:11:48.350 --> 00:11:51.560
of understand the life
ways of its inhabitants.

00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:54.780
Note for example how, I'm
not going to go too much

00:11:54.780 --> 00:11:57.030
into what you see here,
but the western end

00:11:57.030 --> 00:11:59.500
of the site is much
higher mounded

00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:03.140
than what you see at the east.

00:12:03.140 --> 00:12:06.440
I'm going to, instead of talking
about our theories for the east

00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:11.890
and then move on for right
now and show you this image,

00:12:11.890 --> 00:12:14.700
which is facing northeast
to orient you, to bring you

00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:17.310
in closer to that high mounded
western end of the site.

00:12:17.310 --> 00:12:20.610
You've seen it at a slightly
different angle from before.

00:12:20.610 --> 00:12:22.460
And, this also brings us
to the other [inaudible]

00:12:22.460 --> 00:12:25.330
of our current research project.

00:12:25.330 --> 00:12:27.670
So, the area we were excavating,

00:12:27.670 --> 00:12:30.040
this is before we
started excavating,

00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:32.700
it's in this really strategic
central part of the city

00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:35.970
between the citadel,
which you see up here,

00:12:35.970 --> 00:12:40.400
and a major city gate of
the site on the seaside.

00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:44.440
So, this is just another view
looking the other direction

00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:47.480
or from one of the major
customs areas of the site,

00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:50.630
to where the major mound is
that we started working on,

00:12:50.630 --> 00:12:53.020
and it's close to the sea.

00:12:53.020 --> 00:12:55.960
So, what's interesting about
this is you can hopefully see

00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:58.100
that in this area very high,

00:12:58.100 --> 00:13:01.610
multistory collapsed
stone mounding here

00:13:01.610 --> 00:13:04.650
and an open major
street or a courtyard.

00:13:04.650 --> 00:13:07.610
And, this mound that we're
looking at faces directly

00:13:07.610 --> 00:13:11.680
down this street or
courtyard towards the citadel.

00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:16.840
Up close, this is a mound prior
to excavation and I just wanted

00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:19.750
to give you a bit of a glimpse
of kind of what it looks

00:13:19.750 --> 00:13:23.030
like as things start to
emerge underneath that.

00:13:23.030 --> 00:13:24.330
It's pretty dramatic.

00:13:24.330 --> 00:13:27.230
There's a lot of working
through this rubble, but rooms

00:13:27.230 --> 00:13:29.710
and walls start to emerge.

00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:33.260
Our investigations are
specifically designed

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:36.680
to recover artifacts, spaces,
and organic remains that look

00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:40.850
at daily life for the residents
and the visitors to this port.

00:13:40.850 --> 00:13:44.290
Here's a map of what
we have got here,

00:13:44.290 --> 00:13:47.770
so for scale these are
five-meter squares,

00:13:47.770 --> 00:13:50.140
so we're looking at
quite a large area.

00:13:50.140 --> 00:13:55.480
Our work has revealed two areas
of two major building complexes.

00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:57.850
You can maybe see the different
orientation of the walls

00:13:57.850 --> 00:14:00.770
in this area and this section.

00:14:00.770 --> 00:14:02.320
I know this pointer
is not ideal,

00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:05.450
but these walls are running much
more north, south, east, west,

00:14:05.450 --> 00:14:06.750
and these are at a bit of angle.

00:14:06.750 --> 00:14:09.670
And, there's a lot of rebuilds,
as I've, it's kind of a theme

00:14:09.670 --> 00:14:13.000
when talking about this site,
so it's not one coherent plan

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.540
but we're looking at phases
and phases of rebuilding

00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:19.000
and remodeling over time.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.520
For example, we can
see things that used

00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:24.780
to be standard rooms get
subdivided or walled off,

00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:27.990
people no longer want to use
certain areas and they want

00:14:27.990 --> 00:14:30.820
to build on in others.

00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:35.830
These two buildings do have
deposits that overlap in time,

00:14:35.830 --> 00:14:37.660
so at least in the latest phases

00:14:37.660 --> 00:14:40.090
of their occupation they
may have been related

00:14:40.090 --> 00:14:43.320
as an extended family compound.

00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:49.460
This is an example, just to
give you a glimpse of one

00:14:49.460 --> 00:14:50.760
of the rooms, all right?

00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:52.380
Note these two doors.

00:14:52.380 --> 00:14:53.790
Here's a door that
hasn't been excavated.

00:14:53.790 --> 00:14:56.230
We have since -- since
we've taken this photo,

00:14:56.230 --> 00:14:58.720
this room has been
excavated as well.

00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:00.910
this is the same room, just
a little more cleaned up,

00:15:00.910 --> 00:15:04.540
but you can see two entrance
doors there, a hallway here.

00:15:04.540 --> 00:15:07.840
So, all of these are excavations
in progress so you can sort

00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:12.350
of see deposits we're
coming through.

00:15:12.350 --> 00:15:16.320
Okay, and this picture's
going to illustrate that --

00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:19.090
our evidence that this was a
multistory building, right?

00:15:19.090 --> 00:15:20.950
So, here you have
a major staircase.

00:15:20.950 --> 00:15:23.720
It's leading up to a
mostly destroyed upper floor

00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:25.020
of the building.

00:15:25.020 --> 00:15:26.710
We do have portions
of that upper floor,

00:15:26.710 --> 00:15:30.660
so in this photo you see
a plaster floor upstairs

00:15:30.660 --> 00:15:31.960
being uncovered.

00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:35.100
That plaster floor is two
and a half meters higher

00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:37.130
than the plaster
floor that we found

00:15:37.130 --> 00:15:38.550
at the base of those stairs.

00:15:38.550 --> 00:15:43.130
So, we also have flooring in
the room that I just showed you

00:15:43.130 --> 00:15:45.600
at -- almost identical
within centimeters

00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:47.340
of the same elevation
as the floor

00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:48.640
at the bottom of the stairs.

00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:51.810
So, we're able to identify
certain living levels

00:15:51.810 --> 00:15:54.810
and certain floors
of the building.

00:15:54.810 --> 00:15:57.740
Also, to kind of illustrate the
architecture of the building,

00:15:57.740 --> 00:16:01.870
this partially excavated
room, if you notice here,

00:16:01.870 --> 00:16:06.210
maybe you can just see a sort
of strange marking that seems

00:16:06.210 --> 00:16:09.610
like it's in the plaster of the
remnants, plaster of this wall.

00:16:09.610 --> 00:16:11.040
This is a door.

00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:12.770
So, we're just beginning
to get in here.

00:16:12.770 --> 00:16:15.130
You just see the top of the
door emerge, and this is one

00:16:15.130 --> 00:16:18.230
of those doors that was
intentionally filled later on.

00:16:18.230 --> 00:16:20.810
I guess they, you know, didn't
want to use this room anymore,

00:16:20.810 --> 00:16:23.890
it was getting dangerous or dank
in the center of the building.

00:16:23.890 --> 00:16:25.190
I don't know.

00:16:25.190 --> 00:16:29.030
you can also see where this
wall is broken and that to kind

00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:32.730
of illustrate is where the
ceiling would have been

00:16:32.730 --> 00:16:34.240
for that room.

00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:36.420
We know things about how
the ceilings were made

00:16:36.420 --> 00:16:38.420
and where they were because
sometimes we find remnants

00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:41.920
of them and that's what you
see in the other photo here.

00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:46.040
This person is brushing
out basically the plaster

00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:49.070
that was left when the beam
that was there rotted away

00:16:49.070 --> 00:16:51.330
from this part of the ceiling.

00:16:51.330 --> 00:16:55.080
So, that's when ceilings tend to
collapse is after the beams rot,

00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:57.910
but sometimes we get these
sort of negative casts.

00:17:02.090 --> 00:17:04.820
So, here's another
excavation reveal for you.

00:17:04.820 --> 00:17:08.230
Prior to excavation,
the most north face

00:17:08.230 --> 00:17:10.630
of the structure was
almost four meters high

00:17:10.630 --> 00:17:13.220
on very steep mounding.

00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:19.160
So, and, almost the same
direction you can see

00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:22.730
after a season of excavation,
we removed a lot of that.

00:17:22.730 --> 00:17:26.920
Now, it's here, waiting to
be taken away, and you start

00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:29.210
to see a really --
building walls

00:17:29.210 --> 00:17:33.490
and different phases
of occupation.

00:17:33.490 --> 00:17:36.200
To flip it around, on
the same slope looking

00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:38.210
at it directly facing south.

00:17:38.210 --> 00:17:40.470
I'm not going to go too
much into that especially

00:17:40.470 --> 00:17:42.980
because I don't have a pointer
to really show you anything,

00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:46.840
but you have some very early
walls built of a sort of larger,

00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:49.110
more -- a better
cut monumental stone

00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:50.780
that we get in later phases.

00:17:50.780 --> 00:17:53.530
You can see where she's
excavating and here

00:17:53.530 --> 00:17:56.880
in the middle, some
intentional fill layers

00:17:56.880 --> 00:18:00.060
in between this level and
the levels that are above.

00:18:00.060 --> 00:18:03.090
We also have -- this is a
very interesting curved wall,

00:18:03.090 --> 00:18:04.390
almost tower-like.

00:18:04.390 --> 00:18:06.920
We're still working on
trying to interpret that.

00:18:11.060 --> 00:18:14.410
So, archeological knowledge must
be constructed and strengthened

00:18:14.410 --> 00:18:17.650
by multiple related lines
of evidence from production,

00:18:17.650 --> 00:18:20.390
distribution, and
consumption contexts,

00:18:20.390 --> 00:18:23.210
analyzed across all these
different scales from landscapes

00:18:23.210 --> 00:18:27.330
of regions to the city plans,
the architecture, right?

00:18:27.330 --> 00:18:31.070
So, things down to small as
microscopic, organic residues,

00:18:31.070 --> 00:18:33.210
or charred grains in a hearth.

00:18:33.210 --> 00:18:36.370
Archeologists most often are
reconstructing patterns of life

00:18:36.370 --> 00:18:38.470
from artifacts such
as you see here.

00:18:38.470 --> 00:18:42.870
I mean, small fragments
of pots, glass, coins.

00:18:42.870 --> 00:18:44.810
In the next few slides,

00:18:44.810 --> 00:18:47.610
I'm going to show you just a
few highlights quickly of some

00:18:47.610 --> 00:18:50.350
of the things that we've
found in this building,

00:18:50.350 --> 00:18:53.260
in these two building, and
what these artifacts kind

00:18:53.260 --> 00:18:57.790
of give you a glimpse
of daily life.

00:18:57.790 --> 00:19:00.660
Sharing food, drink, and
other consumable items

00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:02.850
as we all just did,
it's an essential way

00:19:02.850 --> 00:19:06.350
that humans everywhere show
their cultural identity,

00:19:06.350 --> 00:19:10.210
display their status, mark
social events, enact generosity,

00:19:10.210 --> 00:19:13.380
and facilitate financial
transactions.

00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:15.250
The greatest proportion
of the artifacts found

00:19:15.250 --> 00:19:18.610
in our excavations are
ceramics, bones, and other items

00:19:18.610 --> 00:19:21.180
that tell us about
eating practices.

00:19:21.180 --> 00:19:23.390
A significant portion
of those artifacts

00:19:23.390 --> 00:19:28.420
and organic remains are related
to practices of hospitality,

00:19:28.420 --> 00:19:31.370
generosity, and sociality.

00:19:31.370 --> 00:19:34.420
So, the folks at this port may
have been sharing their cultural

00:19:34.420 --> 00:19:39.140
way of life and their eating
with other people and I think

00:19:39.140 --> 00:19:40.660
that we're getting
towards the level

00:19:40.660 --> 00:19:43.180
of analysis is still ongoing
where we can start to pick

00:19:43.180 --> 00:19:46.310
out that there are African
types of pottery and food items,

00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:48.120
there are Indian types of
pottery and food items.

00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:51.240
There are certainly local,
and so we're really interested

00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:53.440
in this sort of multiethnic
identity of the port,

00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:54.870
and was it place where people --

00:19:54.870 --> 00:19:57.910
where we can really see people
getting along and, you know,

00:19:57.910 --> 00:20:00.480
making relationships,
and generating these kind

00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:03.110
of economic transactions.

00:20:03.110 --> 00:20:09.790
Some other social activities we
see evidence of include games,

00:20:09.790 --> 00:20:14.270
game boards, they chewed beetle
nuts in the very latest phases

00:20:14.270 --> 00:20:17.800
of the city, tobacco
pipes start to emerge,

00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:20.370
so they're smoking tobacco.

00:20:20.370 --> 00:20:24.670
We also have instruments,
so music is something that,

00:20:24.670 --> 00:20:28.240
you know, we would know should
be a part of a life in a city

00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:31.070
and people going, enjoying
time together and food.

00:20:31.070 --> 00:20:34.470
But, we have some actual
evidence and clearly a sort

00:20:34.470 --> 00:20:38.740
of a wind instrument, the
bone recorder or flute,

00:20:38.740 --> 00:20:41.710
some pieces of inlay you see.

00:20:41.710 --> 00:20:44.550
These are inlay possible
from a stringed instrument.

00:20:44.550 --> 00:20:46.880
I can't prove it, but
there's some interesting wear

00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:48.180
along this.

00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:51.010
If someone is an expert in
ancient instruments wants

00:20:51.010 --> 00:20:53.940
to have a look, that'd be great.

00:20:53.940 --> 00:20:56.240
We also have a pick
that might be a pick

00:20:56.240 --> 00:20:58.970
for a lute-like instrument
for picking the strings.

00:21:02.490 --> 00:21:04.310
They were all found close
by one another, too,

00:21:04.310 --> 00:21:05.610
so that's interesting.

00:21:05.610 --> 00:21:09.210
Maybe sort of a musical
section of the building.

00:21:09.210 --> 00:21:12.640
Oil lamps, another interesting
piece of material culture

00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:16.160
that sheds light on an everyday
reality of life in the city.

00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:19.110
Most of the oil lamps are small
like these made of simple,

00:21:19.110 --> 00:21:22.000
locally made terracotta
ceramics.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:26.270
However, we also found this much
more elaborate star-shaped lamp.

00:21:26.270 --> 00:21:29.720
This is quite lovely,
made of a soft soapstone,

00:21:29.720 --> 00:21:33.000
which is not found
locally in Dhofar.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:36.320
Evidence for this and also the
other lamps that, you know,

00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:38.670
tell us that it was
actually used

00:21:38.670 --> 00:21:41.670
for an oil lamp are the
burn points which I've kind

00:21:41.670 --> 00:21:45.780
of highlighted on
this upper photo.

00:21:45.780 --> 00:21:49.790
Each point had a wick
and a point of light.

00:21:49.790 --> 00:21:53.690
The lamp was made to be
suspended by an iron pin

00:21:53.690 --> 00:21:55.890
or a chain through
a central column.

00:21:55.890 --> 00:21:59.000
So, with its multiple points of
light it would have been rather

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:01.880
like a small chandelier,
quite lovely.

00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:03.960
This is just a historic
lamp from Yemen.

00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:06.240
It's not star shaped, but just
to give you kind of an idea

00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:09.530
of how it might have been
hung, how it would work.

00:22:10.610 --> 00:22:15.210
Well, we also have some
perishable artifacts,

00:22:15.210 --> 00:22:17.950
fibers such as this rope.

00:22:17.950 --> 00:22:20.650
This is a small fragment
of cloth which is still

00:22:20.650 --> 00:22:24.000
under analysis, but my expert
thinks it might be silk,

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:26.970
beautifully painted
wooden bowl fragment.

00:22:30.270 --> 00:22:31.570
Another class of artifacts

00:22:31.570 --> 00:22:34.120
that gives us a really I
think intimate view of people

00:22:34.120 --> 00:22:36.040
who lived at Al-Baleed
is that of jewelry

00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:37.340
and personal adornment.

00:22:37.340 --> 00:22:39.070
Here are some examples.

00:22:39.070 --> 00:22:42.260
some of the many different
types of beans that we find,

00:22:42.260 --> 00:22:43.620
sizes, colors, materials.

00:22:43.620 --> 00:22:45.960
Glass bracelets, we find
a lot of glass bracelets.

00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:47.260
We find a lot of
glass bracelets.

00:22:47.260 --> 00:22:49.850
So, bangle, shell bangle
showed up earlier in a talk.

00:22:49.850 --> 00:22:51.780
These are glass.

00:22:51.780 --> 00:22:55.500
Perfume bottles, so your
perfume bottle neck here

00:22:55.500 --> 00:23:00.240
and also some bottle
fragments in this shot,

00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:02.850
all of these items
are identified studied

00:23:02.850 --> 00:23:05.550
and then we want to put them
back into the larger context

00:23:05.550 --> 00:23:07.350
of where they're
found for analysis.

00:23:07.350 --> 00:23:08.650
So, I'm just going
to bring you back

00:23:08.650 --> 00:23:11.210
to the excavation
map again briefly

00:23:11.210 --> 00:23:12.630
to kind of talk about that.

00:23:12.630 --> 00:23:15.400
So, we want to look and we're
still working on this analysis,

00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:18.580
but the statistical analysis of
the patterns and how they relate

00:23:18.580 --> 00:23:20.000
to the architecture
are helping us

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:22.670
to understand not just
what happened at the city

00:23:22.670 --> 00:23:24.600
or even just this structure,
but down to the level

00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:26.760
of individual rooms and spaces.

00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:29.680
We mentioned that the
musical instruments are coming

00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:32.960
from the same which was
actually over here, the --

00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:37.190
I just had a student who's
just finished measuring a lot

00:23:37.190 --> 00:23:39.960
of glass bracelets and she's
found that some of them are

00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:42.840
so small, the diameter, that
they must have been worn

00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:44.980
by children, which
is quite interesting.

00:23:44.980 --> 00:23:48.490
So, we're looking not at just an
administrative building where,

00:23:48.490 --> 00:23:51.970
you know, men of the town
came, but a family space,

00:23:51.970 --> 00:23:54.680
that we have, you know, the
women and we have children.

00:23:54.680 --> 00:23:57.160
And, another thing that's quite
interesting is almost all,

00:23:57.160 --> 00:23:58.470
I think except for one example

00:23:58.470 --> 00:24:00.830
of those child size
bracelets all come

00:24:00.830 --> 00:24:03.110
from two rooms right over here.

00:24:03.110 --> 00:24:04.910
I don't know if we
have a nursery.

00:24:04.910 --> 00:24:07.500
It's quite interesting.

00:24:07.500 --> 00:24:11.940
I want to just turn briefly
to the building here,

00:24:11.940 --> 00:24:14.790
the second building that we
started working in the east

00:24:14.790 --> 00:24:16.190
and we've been working
west gradually

00:24:16.190 --> 00:24:17.690
over six seasons of excavation.

00:24:17.690 --> 00:24:19.200
And, so we're relatively
new getting

00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:23.770
into the second building, which
used to be, it's a courtyard,

00:24:23.770 --> 00:24:27.890
a large open courtyard
with small rooms around it.

00:24:27.890 --> 00:24:31.370
And, I just wanted
to point out some

00:24:31.370 --> 00:24:34.120
of these interesting
features that we have.

00:24:34.120 --> 00:24:38.090
I just want to show
you up close.

00:24:38.090 --> 00:24:40.200
So, this is another facet
of private lives here

00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:42.520
in this courtyard,
we have basins or,

00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:44.230
I think they're actually baths.

00:24:44.230 --> 00:24:46.630
So, we have these lovely
plastered baths, they're small

00:24:46.630 --> 00:24:49.790
by our standards, but they're
deep, kind of deep soaking tubs.

00:24:49.790 --> 00:24:51.570
But, they are slightly
different in sizes.

00:24:51.570 --> 00:24:52.870
Here's one, there's another,

00:24:52.870 --> 00:24:54.220
there's excavators
working on it.

00:24:54.220 --> 00:24:56.560
They have formal
plaster drain systems,

00:24:56.560 --> 00:25:00.580
so they're very clean
[inaudible] and had a kind

00:25:00.580 --> 00:25:04.840
of very intricate system of
water and drains, which we know

00:25:04.840 --> 00:25:07.410
from elsewhere in the site, too,
but this I quite interesting

00:25:07.410 --> 00:25:09.950
for this house complex.

00:25:13.210 --> 00:25:15.390
For this excavation
project we've also developed

00:25:15.390 --> 00:25:18.360
and deployed a unique
comprehensive mobile digital

00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:19.660
data system.

00:25:19.660 --> 00:25:22.540
And, this not only facilitates
rapid, comprehensive,

00:25:22.540 --> 00:25:25.540
paperless data collection in
the field, but also relates,

00:25:25.540 --> 00:25:28.900
integrates, and tracks all of
this excavation data from point

00:25:28.900 --> 00:25:31.590
of origin to analysis
into long term storage.

00:25:31.590 --> 00:25:34.760
We want this to be
efficient, but also to be able

00:25:34.760 --> 00:25:38.630
to share data more immediately,
more fully, and more sustainably

00:25:38.630 --> 00:25:41.840
in a way that fits a Global
Heritage site such as Al-Baleed,

00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:44.730
and hopefully this will
have more and more spinoffs

00:25:44.730 --> 00:25:47.270
for interaction of
visitors to Al-Baleed

00:25:47.270 --> 00:25:51.320
with the data in the future.

00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:53.750
Port cities are particularly
dynamic places,

00:25:53.750 --> 00:25:57.310
both rooted in local patterns
and cultures, but also the site

00:25:57.310 --> 00:26:00.050
for diverse multicultural
interactions.

00:26:00.050 --> 00:26:03.200
They're places where not only
trade goods and diverse people,

00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:06.120
but also a kaleidoscope
of ideas, cultures,

00:26:06.120 --> 00:26:08.920
and ways of seeing the
world come into contact.

00:26:08.920 --> 00:26:11.130
And, Al-Baleed's current role

00:26:11.130 --> 00:26:14.700
as an archeological park this
is still as true as it ever was.

00:26:14.700 --> 00:26:17.370
Visited by diverse people
from all over the world

00:26:17.370 --> 00:26:20.050
in a new phase of its
occupation, the city is a place

00:26:20.050 --> 00:26:24.180
where be both look to the
past and forge a new future.

00:26:24.180 --> 00:26:27.240
Bringing together the two facets
of our project in excavation

00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:32.170
and digital recording, new
horizons of interpretation,

00:26:32.170 --> 00:26:37.030
scientific advancement, and
tourism become possible.

00:26:37.030 --> 00:26:40.870
So, I just want to finish
with acknowledging the many,

00:26:40.870 --> 00:26:42.540
many people that without

00:26:42.540 --> 00:26:45.910
which this project would not be
possible, especially the folks

00:26:45.910 --> 00:26:47.300
from the Office of the Advisor,

00:26:47.300 --> 00:26:49.470
including Dr. Sunme [assumed
spelling], who's here,

00:26:49.470 --> 00:26:52.640
and our team and everyone else
who's working on the project.

00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:54.440
Thank you.

00:26:54.440 --> 00:26:59.500
[ Applause ]

00:27:03.550 --> 00:27:06.150
&gt;&gt; Moderator: Thank you,

00:27:06.150 --> 00:27:11.770
Dr. Lewis for a wonderful
presentation.

00:27:11.770 --> 00:27:18.210
Our next speaker is
Dr. Joy McCorriston.

00:27:18.210 --> 00:27:20.720
Joy McCorriston is a professor

00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:25.280
at the Ohio State University
Department of Anthropology

00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:28.550
and director of the
ASOM Project,

00:27:28.550 --> 00:27:32.260
Ancient Sociological
Systems in Oman.

00:27:32.260 --> 00:27:37.310
She is an archeologist with 40
years of field work experience

00:27:37.310 --> 00:27:41.980
in the Middle East that includes
Oman, Yemen, Jordan, and Egypt,

00:27:41.980 --> 00:27:46.550
and has been conducting
research in Oman since 2009.

00:27:46.550 --> 00:27:50.070
Her collaborative research has
discovered the earliest dates

00:27:50.070 --> 00:27:53.790
for domesticated cattle
and sheep in Arabia,

00:27:53.790 --> 00:27:58.430
older than 8000 Cal
BP, and established

00:27:58.430 --> 00:28:02.150
that agricultural technologist
trailed pastoral adaptations

00:28:02.150 --> 00:28:05.250
by some 2500 years.

00:28:05.250 --> 00:28:09.480
In the fall, her team located
an excavated monument and tombs

00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:13.140
of mutli-types as well
as two rural settlements.

00:28:13.140 --> 00:28:15.490
Dr. McCorriston obtained her PHD

00:28:15.490 --> 00:28:18.920
in rural anthropology
at Yale University.

00:28:18.920 --> 00:28:20.720
Please welcome Dr. McCorriston.

00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:27.240
[ Applause ]

00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:28.700
&gt;&gt; Dr. Joy McCorriston:
Well, thank you very much.

00:28:28.700 --> 00:28:31.830
It is a great honor and a
great pleasure to be here

00:28:31.830 --> 00:28:35.860
in such a wonderful setting
and to see many familiar faces

00:28:35.860 --> 00:28:39.500
and many new faces
with us today.

00:28:39.500 --> 00:28:42.470
I want to start by thanking,

00:28:42.470 --> 00:28:45.570
as our presenters
have done before me,

00:28:45.570 --> 00:28:46.870
Dr. Deeb [assumed spelling]

00:28:46.870 --> 00:28:53.250
and the Sultan Qaboos Cultural
Center and the Embassy of Oman

00:28:53.250 --> 00:28:58.840
for hosting this and giving us
a chance to provide something

00:28:58.840 --> 00:29:05.370
of a snapshot of some
ongoing projects that are some

00:29:05.370 --> 00:29:07.480
of the more very
visible and some

00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:10.740
of them are not so easy to see.

00:29:10.740 --> 00:29:14.200
And, I think some of our
work is going to fall

00:29:14.200 --> 00:29:16.400
in the latter category.

00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:20.400
So, I'd like to talk about
monuments which are visible,

00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:23.940
and mobility and
pastoral territoriality,

00:29:23.940 --> 00:29:29.420
which is really behavior and as
it takes some archeological work

00:29:29.420 --> 00:29:32.930
to tease that out and
make that visible.

00:29:32.930 --> 00:29:37.970
So, those are topics that I
would like to lead in today.

00:29:42.260 --> 00:29:45.980
What I'd like to do with you
in the next few minutes is

00:29:45.980 --> 00:29:49.180
to explore what we can learn

00:29:49.180 --> 00:29:54.450
about the dynamic lives
of ancient safaris.

00:29:54.450 --> 00:29:58.140
And, if you walk away
from this presentation

00:29:58.140 --> 00:30:02.510
with one simple idea, it is

00:30:02.510 --> 00:30:06.360
that despite these
really magnificent ruins

00:30:06.360 --> 00:30:12.200
that we've seen from other parts
of Oman and the spectacular site

00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:14.860
of Al-Baleed on the coast
-- so here comes the idea,

00:30:14.860 --> 00:30:22.350
a you with me -- 95
percent of all Omanis

00:30:22.350 --> 00:30:25.370
who ever lived were
mobile people

00:30:25.370 --> 00:30:28.250
and of those a very
large percentage

00:30:28.250 --> 00:30:30.580
of them were pastoralists.

00:30:30.580 --> 00:30:35.760
So, although I will not be
showing you spectacular objects,

00:30:35.760 --> 00:30:40.530
I could like to make
the case this afternoon

00:30:40.530 --> 00:30:46.660
that it is important to consider
the lives of these people

00:30:46.660 --> 00:30:52.020
who have left a lot
less for us to look at.

00:30:52.020 --> 00:30:55.670
I will talk a little bit about
pastoralism and archeology

00:30:55.670 --> 00:30:59.090
and some of these challenges,
bringing that course

00:30:59.090 --> 00:31:00.750
to the case of Dhofar.

00:31:00.750 --> 00:31:03.960
And, in the spirit of the
broader presentation today,

00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:08.770
although I am no expert on
cultural tourism, I recognized

00:31:08.770 --> 00:31:13.340
that this is an important
component of Oman's heritage

00:31:13.340 --> 00:31:18.340
and therefore I would like
to offer a few very amateur

00:31:18.340 --> 00:31:19.640
thoughts about that.

00:31:19.640 --> 00:31:23.550
So, I hope you'll indulge me.

00:31:23.550 --> 00:31:26.650
Pastoralism in Dhofar,
we now know,

00:31:26.650 --> 00:31:30.320
that it began about
8000 years ago.

00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:32.030
That's a long time.

00:31:32.030 --> 00:31:35.100
And, through that time,

00:31:35.100 --> 00:31:39.710
pastoralism has been
a dynamic system.

00:31:39.710 --> 00:31:43.140
It has also been a
long term adaptation,

00:31:43.140 --> 00:31:49.530
a way in which people have
matched their social behaviors

00:31:49.530 --> 00:31:55.140
to the availability of
resources, the distribution

00:31:55.140 --> 00:32:01.300
of resources, really
developed a dynamic ecology.

00:32:01.300 --> 00:32:05.200
And, in that process
over 8000 years,

00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:08.100
pastoralists have changed
their environment even

00:32:08.100 --> 00:32:10.030
as they have fitted themselves

00:32:10.030 --> 00:32:12.670
to this dynamic changing
environment.

00:32:12.670 --> 00:32:17.610
So, we talk about this really
as a niche, a pastoral niche,

00:32:17.610 --> 00:32:23.640
the ancient safaris shaped the
world and the world shaped them

00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:26.370
so that they really
hung onto to pastoralism

00:32:26.370 --> 00:32:29.920
for a very long time.

00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:33.940
But, what we understand
about pastoralism tends

00:32:33.940 --> 00:32:38.570
to be very much framed
from what we can see

00:32:38.570 --> 00:32:40.990
of pastoralist behaviors today.

00:32:40.990 --> 00:32:44.900
Of the cultural anthropology and
I've met a couple of you who are

00:32:44.900 --> 00:32:47.180
or have studied cultural
anthropology,

00:32:47.180 --> 00:32:50.810
and it gives us a really great
understanding of behavior,

00:32:50.810 --> 00:32:54.990
but it gives us a very static,
sort of snapshot "I was there,

00:32:54.990 --> 00:32:59.440
I saw this for a year and
wrote it up" kind of impression

00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:03.740
of what in Dhofar is really
a very long term history.

00:33:03.740 --> 00:33:12.010
So, in Dhofar, a really
very wonderful portrait

00:33:12.010 --> 00:33:16.300
of traditional pastoral
lifestyles was presented

00:33:16.300 --> 00:33:19.570
by a German man named Jorg
Johnson [assumed spelling],

00:33:19.570 --> 00:33:25.070
who was in Dhofar
in the middle 1970s

00:33:25.070 --> 00:33:30.230
and wrote a seminal work
called "Nomads in the Sultanate

00:33:30.230 --> 00:33:33.070
of Oman", which came
out in 1986.

00:33:33.070 --> 00:33:35.820
We relied on that a
great deal in trying

00:33:35.820 --> 00:33:38.860
to understand what
traditional life was like.

00:33:38.860 --> 00:33:44.340
And, so this image before
you, it shows arrows that map

00:33:44.340 --> 00:33:47.650
onto Dhofar and here I have to
thank Dr. Lewis for giving us

00:33:47.650 --> 00:33:49.630
such a nice introduction
so I don't need

00:33:49.630 --> 00:33:51.770
to tell you about the monsoon.

00:33:51.770 --> 00:33:57.770
But, this maps a kind of
1970s mobility pattern

00:33:57.770 --> 00:34:02.270
onto that landscape.

00:34:02.270 --> 00:34:07.040
And, so the small sort of radius

00:34:07.040 --> 00:34:11.230
around a certain
point is documenting,

00:34:11.230 --> 00:34:13.080
meant to document the mobility

00:34:13.080 --> 00:34:15.930
of the traditional cattle
herders in the mountains

00:34:15.930 --> 00:34:19.560
who extensively relied
on a grassland plateau

00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:21.540
which is very narrow actually.

00:34:21.540 --> 00:34:26.740
It's only in some places
a few hundred meters wide.

00:34:26.740 --> 00:34:35.070
And, these longer arrow map
a mobility and transhumance

00:34:35.070 --> 00:34:40.320
of cattle herders back and
forth across the mountains

00:34:40.320 --> 00:34:44.550
into the interior
and from the coast.

00:34:46.190 --> 00:34:49.200
This is the ethnographic
present.

00:34:49.200 --> 00:34:51.640
One thing we've been doing
as a team is trying to look

00:34:51.640 --> 00:34:53.920
at the dynamics of
that environment,

00:34:53.920 --> 00:34:57.230
which is also not static
and I don't think that comes

00:34:57.230 --> 00:34:59.810
as a surprise to anyone
in this room to realize

00:34:59.810 --> 00:35:01.520
that environments change.

00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:04.180
Ours is changing today.

00:35:04.180 --> 00:35:07.760
What has been learned
very recently by some

00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:10.200
of the botanists from
the Oman Botanical Garden

00:35:10.200 --> 00:35:13.970
and some earlier surveys is that
the grasslands on that plateau,

00:35:13.970 --> 00:35:18.280
which provide this critical
resource for cattle eating --

00:35:18.280 --> 00:35:21.290
excuse me, for grass
eating cattle,

00:35:21.290 --> 00:35:25.550
those grasslands
are anthropogenic,

00:35:25.550 --> 00:35:30.790
meaning that they were made by
burning off the cloud forest.

00:35:30.790 --> 00:35:37.160
And, that anthropogenic
creation of grasslands is

00:35:37.160 --> 00:35:41.130
in the botanical world a
fairly recent phenomenon.

00:35:41.130 --> 00:35:43.790
We don't need to get
into how recent here,

00:35:43.790 --> 00:35:48.360
but what it does tell us
is that there is change

00:35:48.360 --> 00:35:52.950
and that the change is part of
that pastoral niche creation

00:35:52.950 --> 00:35:55.180
that I was talking
about, niche construction.

00:35:55.180 --> 00:35:58.540
So, the project that
I've been working

00:35:58.540 --> 00:36:01.410
with most recently is
interested in trying

00:36:01.410 --> 00:36:05.050
to understand what those
changes looked like over time

00:36:05.050 --> 00:36:10.530
and how people engaged with
this changing landscape.

00:36:10.530 --> 00:36:14.570
One thing that we know about
the changes in rainforest is

00:36:14.570 --> 00:36:17.870
that those changes not
only happen on the plateau,

00:36:17.870 --> 00:36:21.260
and so this image shows you,
I'm sure you've gathered by now,

00:36:21.260 --> 00:36:25.320
you can see grasslands on the
plateau, and there's very,

00:36:25.320 --> 00:36:29.260
very sharp and abrupt
transition to these steep slopes

00:36:29.260 --> 00:36:31.360
where the cattle
don't graze as much

00:36:31.360 --> 00:36:33.540
and you still have tree cover

00:36:33.540 --> 00:36:36.810
from that Anglaises
[phonetic] Forest.

00:36:36.810 --> 00:36:41.320
When you remove the tress
from the grassland on the top,

00:36:41.320 --> 00:36:43.320
it has a spatial effect.

00:36:43.320 --> 00:36:45.960
Those monsoon clouds
that Dr. Lewis talked

00:36:45.960 --> 00:36:49.490
about don't penetrate as
far, they're not drawn

00:36:49.490 --> 00:36:52.750
into the interior
and so it means

00:36:52.750 --> 00:36:56.060
that the vegetation way deep
into the Nedjid's changes

00:36:56.060 --> 00:36:59.270
and we heard this morning from
Dr. Asalami [assumed spelling]

00:36:59.270 --> 00:37:01.570
about the changes in the Nedjid

00:37:01.570 --> 00:37:05.040
and how we recognize those are
important and deep prehistory.

00:37:05.040 --> 00:37:07.610
But, those cycles may
have been changing

00:37:07.610 --> 00:37:12.010
in smaller cyclical
events over time.

00:37:12.010 --> 00:37:15.120
So, we are very interested
in pursuing that.

00:37:15.120 --> 00:37:20.980
And, in pursuing the behavior
and adaptation of those many,

00:37:20.980 --> 00:37:26.070
many people who were
pastoralists in ancient Oman.

00:37:26.070 --> 00:37:29.900
Okay, a little bit about
pastoralists and archeology,

00:37:29.900 --> 00:37:33.410
and I'm showing you a
picture of a village in Syria.

00:37:33.410 --> 00:37:36.000
This is the only picture
that is not of Oman,

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:38.450
but I have a reason
for doing this.

00:37:38.450 --> 00:37:41.620
This picture is a village
that's made of mudbrick.

00:37:41.620 --> 00:37:45.190
When these houses fall
down after about 25 years,

00:37:45.190 --> 00:37:47.850
the mudbrick crumbles into mud,

00:37:47.850 --> 00:37:50.570
or dry dust if you're
in Mesopotamia.

00:37:50.570 --> 00:37:55.730
And, it seals in and holds
down all kinds of garbage

00:37:55.730 --> 00:37:59.680
that people leave behind,
broken pottery, pieces of bone,

00:37:59.680 --> 00:38:04.620
bits of copper, all kinds
of things that can tell us

00:38:04.620 --> 00:38:07.500
about the ways people lived.

00:38:07.500 --> 00:38:09.550
Pastoralists don't
live like this.

00:38:09.550 --> 00:38:12.130
They mostly don't
settle in built houses.

00:38:12.130 --> 00:38:14.940
They move around with their
animals because the animals need

00:38:14.940 --> 00:38:17.930
to move on once they've
grazed grass,

00:38:17.930 --> 00:38:21.650
meaning that we don't have
the kind of site formation

00:38:21.650 --> 00:38:22.950
for ancient pastoralists.

00:38:22.950 --> 00:38:26.320
So, archeologists looking
for a site will drive around

00:38:26.320 --> 00:38:28.030
and they'll see something
really big

00:38:28.030 --> 00:38:29.600
and they'll say, "That's great."

00:38:29.600 --> 00:38:32.280
And, they'll learn about
five percent of the people

00:38:32.280 --> 00:38:38.090
that ever lived in Oman, which
is wonderful, but we have less

00:38:38.090 --> 00:38:42.320
of a record of the
lives of other people

00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:46.680
and therefore it's harder to
understand their behavior.

00:38:46.680 --> 00:38:50.040
So, places like Sumhuram in
Dhofar on the coast, you know,

00:38:50.040 --> 00:38:53.260
we've also heard about it
as Khor Rori, Al-Baleed,

00:38:53.260 --> 00:38:57.550
the Oasis of the North with the
al Falaj, very highly visible.

00:38:57.550 --> 00:39:03.100
But, very few of the populations
ever lived in there places.

00:39:03.100 --> 00:39:07.190
The material of --
the material culture

00:39:07.190 --> 00:39:09.600
of pastoralists is
typically light,

00:39:09.600 --> 00:39:11.100
sparse, and often organic.

00:39:11.100 --> 00:39:14.440
Now this is something
that we can be grateful

00:39:14.440 --> 00:39:17.230
to cultural anthropologists
for, again,

00:39:17.230 --> 00:39:20.040
because we can see
how pastoralists live

00:39:20.040 --> 00:39:21.340
in the modern day.

00:39:21.340 --> 00:39:23.880
And, being mobile people
they don't carry one

00:39:23.880 --> 00:39:27.700
of those great big, heavy, Indus
water jars or whatever they had

00:39:27.700 --> 00:39:32.290
in them that is going to be
really tough to lug around

00:39:32.290 --> 00:39:34.140
and if you drop it it'll break.

00:39:34.140 --> 00:39:38.240
Pastoralists tend to make things
out of leather, out of wood,

00:39:38.240 --> 00:39:41.330
out of basketry, out of
leather-lined basketry

00:39:41.330 --> 00:39:43.490
if you want to boil milk.

00:39:43.490 --> 00:39:48.580
They tend to use things
like feathers and dyes

00:39:48.580 --> 00:39:52.000
and thatch to make shelters.

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:55.080
So, my point is that
these things decay.

00:39:55.080 --> 00:39:59.310
And, so there is without
good site preservation,

00:39:59.310 --> 00:40:02.060
there's not a lot
for us to find.

00:40:02.060 --> 00:40:04.280
So, why is she doing
this, you're wondering.

00:40:04.280 --> 00:40:06.170
Here are the problems.

00:40:06.170 --> 00:40:10.530
Pastoralists move around a lot
so the sites are very ephemeral,

00:40:10.530 --> 00:40:13.110
they aren't these big, deep
installations with a lot

00:40:13.110 --> 00:40:18.230
of labor to build really
solid, lasting walls.

00:40:18.230 --> 00:40:21.910
They don't practice agriculture,
at least they did not in Dhofar,

00:40:21.910 --> 00:40:27.520
and that makes them very special
in the world of pastoralists.

00:40:27.520 --> 00:40:29.570
But, they don't leave a
lot of plant remains for us

00:40:29.570 --> 00:40:32.230
to understand what they
eat in the plant world.

00:40:32.230 --> 00:40:34.870
They don't want to kill
off all their animals.

00:40:34.870 --> 00:40:37.080
This is not, you know,
the butcher's shop.

00:40:37.080 --> 00:40:41.390
These animals are precious and
so they are conserving them

00:40:41.390 --> 00:40:46.060
and using them for milk and
only killing them occasionally

00:40:46.060 --> 00:40:47.370
on special occasions.

00:40:47.370 --> 00:40:49.900
So, we don't see a
lot of animal bone

00:40:49.900 --> 00:40:53.220
from these very ephemeral sites.

00:40:53.220 --> 00:40:56.940
They're very mobile, so they're
not carrying a lot around

00:40:56.940 --> 00:41:01.240
and what is is light,
flexible, tends to be organic.

00:41:01.240 --> 00:41:06.020
They tend to have a
tribal social identity

00:41:06.020 --> 00:41:08.770
for long periods of time.

00:41:08.770 --> 00:41:11.860
So, it means that who
they see themselves

00:41:11.860 --> 00:41:15.290
as being is not really
determined

00:41:15.290 --> 00:41:19.490
by how much gold they have
or how big a house they have

00:41:19.490 --> 00:41:22.320
or how much wealth
they've accumulated

00:41:22.320 --> 00:41:24.720
in terms of solid things.

00:41:24.720 --> 00:41:29.090
They tend to have other ways of
identifying their relationships

00:41:29.090 --> 00:41:32.270
to each other as social groups.

00:41:32.270 --> 00:41:37.000
And, they have very low
population densities compared

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:39.900
to, say, a place like Al-Baleed.

00:41:41.510 --> 00:41:44.230
This makes it difficult
as archeologists

00:41:44.230 --> 00:41:46.070
to figure out what to do.

00:41:46.070 --> 00:41:50.420
It's really very hard with this
lack of information even to look

00:41:50.420 --> 00:41:52.510
at the sites that are available

00:41:52.510 --> 00:41:56.770
and to understand the
reuse of the sites.

00:41:56.770 --> 00:42:01.680
So, it's hard, but what I want
to do now is talk about the case

00:42:01.680 --> 00:42:04.120
of Dhofar and talk
about what we can learn

00:42:04.120 --> 00:42:07.690
about these very important
people who were the backbone

00:42:07.690 --> 00:42:14.290
of Oman's long term
heritage one might say.

00:42:14.290 --> 00:42:19.100
These image -- I lied, actually
-- the image on the, let's see,

00:42:19.100 --> 00:42:23.580
it would be your left, is not
from Oman, but it is an image

00:42:23.580 --> 00:42:26.310
of a very widespread
Bronze Age tradition

00:42:26.310 --> 00:42:28.870
of depicting pastoral peoples.

00:42:28.870 --> 00:42:31.500
And, it comes from
fairly nearby.

00:42:31.500 --> 00:42:38.080
It's an Arabian find and it
shows the very prominent dagger.

00:42:38.080 --> 00:42:42.830
And, sometimes we do find these
markers of social identities

00:42:42.830 --> 00:42:48.350
on the righthand side is
a blade from an Omani tomb

00:42:48.350 --> 00:42:51.720
which actually was
excavated by two

00:42:51.720 --> 00:42:54.910
of our speakers this
morning, Michael Harrower

00:42:54.910 --> 00:42:57.180
and Kimberly Williams.

00:42:57.180 --> 00:42:58.960
And, one of the things
that interesting

00:42:58.960 --> 00:43:01.230
about this is it came
out of a Bronze Age tomb

00:43:01.230 --> 00:43:02.820
and the edges are rolled.

00:43:02.820 --> 00:43:05.640
This was not meant to be used.

00:43:05.640 --> 00:43:10.980
This dagger had these
finely blunted edges.

00:43:10.980 --> 00:43:15.770
So, it was probably worn, a very
prestigious object of identity,

00:43:15.770 --> 00:43:22.540
but not really meant to be
drawn and used to kill anything.

00:43:22.540 --> 00:43:26.480
Other ways pastoralists
were visible

00:43:26.480 --> 00:43:28.400
in archeology include sites.

00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:31.390
They leave hearths, some
of that has charcoal

00:43:31.390 --> 00:43:33.740
that can provide dates.

00:43:33.740 --> 00:43:40.320
They clear vegetation, they move
stones around, they drag them

00:43:40.320 --> 00:43:42.520
to hold down tents,
they drag them to hold

00:43:42.520 --> 00:43:46.040
down animals, to corral animals.

00:43:46.040 --> 00:43:49.400
They put up little
platforms to stick bedding

00:43:49.400 --> 00:43:51.480
on top of to keep it dry.

00:43:51.480 --> 00:43:55.780
We see graffiti and
bedrock mortars, enclosures,

00:43:55.780 --> 00:44:00.260
all kinds of things that
are left in the landscape.

00:44:00.260 --> 00:44:02.210
The other thing that
they leave behind,

00:44:02.210 --> 00:44:03.980
and this is particularly
important

00:44:03.980 --> 00:44:10.360
in Dhofar is territory
markers, and we see some

00:44:10.360 --> 00:44:16.080
on the hill here,
right along there.

00:44:16.080 --> 00:44:20.440
And, I believe you've
seen some important tombs

00:44:20.440 --> 00:44:25.280
on the hilltops earlier
in this session.

00:44:25.280 --> 00:44:31.900
So, these are territory markers,
they often appear at places

00:44:31.900 --> 00:44:34.830
or near places where there
are good sources of water.

00:44:34.830 --> 00:44:39.500
They may mark routes
or hunting blinds.

00:44:39.500 --> 00:44:43.130
They may mark other
well sources.

00:44:43.130 --> 00:44:47.580
And, my teams have been
examining these for a number

00:44:47.580 --> 00:44:50.350
of years looking at them
both in their spatial

00:44:50.350 --> 00:44:52.380
and chronological dimensions.

00:44:52.380 --> 00:45:00.240
Here you can see a
platform or cairn.

00:45:00.240 --> 00:45:05.010
This is not one that we
excavated, but it conforms

00:45:05.010 --> 00:45:10.760
to a type of Bronze Age
cairn that we see there.

00:45:10.760 --> 00:45:17.310
This is a typical monument
of about 2000 years ago,

00:45:17.310 --> 00:45:20.090
a very different
style of monument

00:45:20.090 --> 00:45:23.770
but nevertheless a very small
scale investment of labor

00:45:23.770 --> 00:45:25.710
in building these
stone monuments.

00:45:25.710 --> 00:45:30.470
And, here's a boulder that
has been elaborately marked

00:45:30.470 --> 00:45:35.450
on the surface with foot
petroglyphs of footprints,

00:45:35.450 --> 00:45:42.540
maybe snakes or winding water,
some texts in a Dhofari script.

00:45:42.540 --> 00:45:47.570
So, important points, shaped and
marked by pastoralists moving

00:45:47.570 --> 00:45:49.430
through this landscape.

00:45:49.430 --> 00:45:53.450
We've also been exploring the
chronology of these monuments,

00:45:53.450 --> 00:46:02.670
looking at burials in tombs and
also looking at the kinds of,

00:46:02.670 --> 00:46:04.480
not along the styles
of the monuments,

00:46:04.480 --> 00:46:08.210
but the different periods
in which they are excavated.

00:46:08.210 --> 00:46:10.720
So, here they can see, again,

00:46:10.720 --> 00:46:16.830
Dr. Kimberly Williams
excavating a tomb in Dhofar.

00:46:16.830 --> 00:46:22.370
The result of this work over
a number of years has been

00:46:22.370 --> 00:46:26.600
to recognize the spatial
distribution of a number

00:46:26.600 --> 00:46:29.400
of small monuments,
but also differences

00:46:29.400 --> 00:46:32.100
in style and in chronology.

00:46:32.100 --> 00:46:34.520
And, so we have been
able to look

00:46:34.520 --> 00:46:37.420
into all these different
types and I won't go

00:46:37.420 --> 00:46:40.320
into what they are, but
I'd also like to point

00:46:40.320 --> 00:46:45.460
out that we have developed a
dataset that provides something

00:46:45.460 --> 00:46:49.230
of a pattern that's pointing
to some kind of dynamism.

00:46:49.230 --> 00:46:51.510
So, I talked about
pastoralism being dynamic.

00:46:51.510 --> 00:46:56.050
We can see these markers are
changing in style through time.

00:46:56.050 --> 00:46:59.630
We also can see that there
seem to be some pulses

00:46:59.630 --> 00:47:03.060
of when things are being marked

00:47:03.060 --> 00:47:07.470
and territory perhaps is being
expressed and when there seems

00:47:07.470 --> 00:47:09.660
to be a more open system.

00:47:09.660 --> 00:47:15.930
So, this pattern is the result
of a number of years of work.

00:47:15.930 --> 00:47:21.130
And, just a few images of
some of these structures.

00:47:21.130 --> 00:47:24.250
This is a view of a
platform structure

00:47:24.250 --> 00:47:26.390
from the Neolithic period.

00:47:26.390 --> 00:47:30.200
We have not found burials

00:47:30.200 --> 00:47:32.700
in this particular
style of platform.

00:47:32.700 --> 00:47:36.180
That's a hypothesis
to be tested further.

00:47:36.180 --> 00:47:39.950
I think we haven't excavated
as many as we might like to.

00:47:39.950 --> 00:47:43.940
But, for the moment the evidence
that we do have seems to point

00:47:43.940 --> 00:47:48.370
to some kind of commemorative
event, something happened big,

00:47:48.370 --> 00:47:51.540
a big feast, a big
gathering of people.

00:47:51.540 --> 00:47:55.460
we have some data from outside
of Dhofar that kind of point

00:47:55.460 --> 00:47:57.610
to this sort of interpretation.

00:47:57.610 --> 00:48:00.250
And, then a monument
was put in place to kind

00:48:00.250 --> 00:48:02.920
of commemorate that
large gathering.

00:48:02.920 --> 00:48:08.690
Other kinds of monuments
later in time include tombs

00:48:08.690 --> 00:48:11.350
which still are markers.

00:48:11.350 --> 00:48:15.390
And, these are placed
very high, very visible.

00:48:15.390 --> 00:48:19.960
They seem to tie people
not so much to the memory

00:48:19.960 --> 00:48:25.420
of a gathering and a social
community but to a lineage

00:48:25.420 --> 00:48:29.070
and a genealogy, the memory
of who was in this tomb,

00:48:29.070 --> 00:48:32.590
when that person was buried,
when that tomb was last visited.

00:48:32.590 --> 00:48:35.550
So, we see more of a
chronological depth

00:48:35.550 --> 00:48:38.480
to the memories around
these monuments and less

00:48:38.480 --> 00:48:40.630
of a large-scale gathering.

00:48:40.630 --> 00:48:43.930
So, we see some -- perhaps
some change in the behaviors

00:48:43.930 --> 00:48:45.850
of pastoralists through time.

00:48:45.850 --> 00:48:48.160
And, this may, in
fact, be the beginning

00:48:48.160 --> 00:48:50.730
of these genealogical structures

00:48:50.730 --> 00:48:57.280
that shape the social
identities as tribes.

00:48:57.280 --> 00:49:01.010
One thing that the
project has been working

00:49:01.010 --> 00:49:03.300
on recently is there
are some settlements.

00:49:03.300 --> 00:49:06.460
So, I spent a few minutes
telling you how difficult it is

00:49:06.460 --> 00:49:10.220
to reconstruct pastoral
lifestyles from settlement,

00:49:10.220 --> 00:49:12.210
but we actually do have some.

00:49:12.210 --> 00:49:19.270
And, it really surprised us that
these settlements were as robust

00:49:19.270 --> 00:49:21.580
as they turned out to be.

00:49:21.580 --> 00:49:27.660
So, we find circular,
little circular structures

00:49:27.660 --> 00:49:31.520
with some well-built
construction,

00:49:31.520 --> 00:49:36.130
kind of a bee hive
corrivalled vault to them,

00:49:36.130 --> 00:49:38.040
four layers of floors.

00:49:38.040 --> 00:49:40.490
So, people would live in them,
they'd toss down garbage,

00:49:40.490 --> 00:49:43.440
they'd put down more
paving stones in the base,

00:49:43.440 --> 00:49:48.220
they'd live in them again, and
we find three or four episodes.

00:49:48.220 --> 00:49:51.910
Sometimes the ground surface
on these built up so much

00:49:51.910 --> 00:49:55.830
that you would have to
walk down and stoop to get

00:49:55.830 --> 00:49:58.610
into these earlier
ground surfaces

00:49:58.610 --> 00:50:03.140
where these habitations
had been built.

00:50:03.140 --> 00:50:06.340
And, here you can see in
the background of several

00:50:06.340 --> 00:50:10.810
of the more recent team
members, a site that is in kind

00:50:10.810 --> 00:50:13.650
of a basin or bowl
and has a number

00:50:13.650 --> 00:50:17.060
of these stone structures,
but they don't look

00:50:17.060 --> 00:50:18.360
like much on the surface.

00:50:18.360 --> 00:50:20.090
In fact, if you didn't
know what you were looking

00:50:20.090 --> 00:50:22.460
for you would think they
were maybe one stone deep

00:50:22.460 --> 00:50:24.550
and there was not
much to do there.

00:50:24.550 --> 00:50:28.830
So, again, they're not
visually deeply impressive,

00:50:28.830 --> 00:50:31.900
but they do archive information

00:50:31.900 --> 00:50:36.400
about an important
constituent of Oman's heritage.

00:50:36.400 --> 00:50:39.070
Here's a map that we may --

00:50:39.070 --> 00:50:41.750
I'm just showing you this
because I want to impress you

00:50:41.750 --> 00:50:44.320
with how wonderful
my mapping team.

00:50:44.320 --> 00:50:48.190
And, so I don't personally
take a lot of credit for this,

00:50:48.190 --> 00:50:51.730
but you can see that they've
gotten a digital elevation model

00:50:51.730 --> 00:50:54.430
out of some remote imagery.

00:50:54.430 --> 00:50:58.490
In this case we just flew a kite
and then they've gone around

00:50:58.490 --> 00:51:04.800
and mapped using an
instrument, the little corrals

00:51:04.800 --> 00:51:10.120
and cell structures, the
little buildings attached

00:51:10.120 --> 00:51:11.420
to those corrals.

00:51:11.420 --> 00:51:13.870
And, you can see there's
a number of cairns

00:51:13.870 --> 00:51:16.260
and platforms in
this area as well.

00:51:16.260 --> 00:51:17.620
So, chronologically

00:51:17.620 --> 00:51:21.830
and spatially this is quite
a complex little site,

00:51:21.830 --> 00:51:23.830
which I just showed
you doesn't look

00:51:23.830 --> 00:51:26.050
like a whole lot on the surface.

00:51:26.050 --> 00:51:33.730
Some more images from that
site, just giving you a sense

00:51:33.730 --> 00:51:36.220
of the -- what the interiors of
some of these structures here,

00:51:36.220 --> 00:51:38.490
quarter has been excavated out.

00:51:38.490 --> 00:51:41.810
Here we have a half with
a nice entrance way,

00:51:41.810 --> 00:51:43.950
so you can see there's
some depth.

00:51:43.950 --> 00:51:47.260
So, we're able to find
things in those structures

00:51:47.260 --> 00:51:53.020
like the occasional grinding
stone, there's a lot of bone

00:51:53.020 --> 00:51:55.400
in there, gives us a sense
of what people were eating

00:51:55.400 --> 00:51:58.170
and what was important
to them and their herds.

00:51:58.170 --> 00:52:02.000
So, going back to that gap,
I just wanted to remind you

00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:05.200
that we have now
both settlements

00:52:05.200 --> 00:52:10.140
and we have small scale
monuments that are telling us

00:52:10.140 --> 00:52:13.100
about people's access
to resources,

00:52:13.100 --> 00:52:16.660
the places that were important
to build in, to stay in,

00:52:16.660 --> 00:52:22.560
to assert some kind of
visual presence even

00:52:22.560 --> 00:52:25.460
when they were not
actually present

00:52:25.460 --> 00:52:27.610
because they were
wondering with cattle

00:52:27.610 --> 00:52:31.880
to temporary grasslands
or forage areas.

00:52:31.880 --> 00:52:36.850
So, we're actually now
testing this map, this pattern

00:52:36.850 --> 00:52:41.690
with a model in which
territoriality behavior plays a

00:52:41.690 --> 00:52:44.600
role, in which we are
looking at the shift

00:52:44.600 --> 00:52:48.120
from perhaps an open
property regime which would be

00:52:48.120 --> 00:52:51.240
in these periods when we know
there are lower populations

00:52:51.240 --> 00:52:52.960
elsewhere in the
Arabian Peninsula.

00:52:52.960 --> 00:52:56.420
And, we would think
there would be an open --

00:52:56.420 --> 00:52:59.430
more of an open availability
of resources

00:52:59.430 --> 00:53:02.970
and high mobility going
back and forth to resources.

00:53:02.970 --> 00:53:11.570
As populations grow in better
times, perhaps with the --

00:53:11.570 --> 00:53:15.960
perhaps with concentration
around resources,

00:53:15.960 --> 00:53:20.110
there would be lower mobility
and in between trees might take

00:53:20.110 --> 00:53:23.600
over in abandoned
grassland areas and leading

00:53:23.600 --> 00:53:26.890
to a population decline
in some of those areas

00:53:26.890 --> 00:53:28.280
and a return of grasses.

00:53:28.280 --> 00:53:32.160
So, the project going forward
is really testing this idea

00:53:32.160 --> 00:53:38.260
of there being a dynamic system
that couples the human behavior,

00:53:38.260 --> 00:53:43.320
the human social dynamic
and mobility with changes

00:53:43.320 --> 00:53:45.610
in the environment
with the shift

00:53:45.610 --> 00:53:48.560
between anthropogenic grasslands

00:53:48.560 --> 00:53:51.070
and the recovery of
tress in between .

00:53:51.070 --> 00:53:56.050
So, we're really interested
in that long term dynamism

00:53:56.050 --> 00:53:59.460
and as I've tried to show
you the low term changes

00:53:59.460 --> 00:54:04.570
where people come back to using
monuments over and over again

00:54:04.570 --> 00:54:07.200
to express their
presence in a region,

00:54:07.200 --> 00:54:09.900
but doing so in some
very different ways,

00:54:09.900 --> 00:54:12.140
kind of shaping monuments
differently,

00:54:12.140 --> 00:54:14.430
relating to them
differently as tombs

00:54:14.430 --> 00:54:18.220
or as platforms and
gathering places.

00:54:18.220 --> 00:54:22.710
So, I said I would end
with a few implications

00:54:22.710 --> 00:54:24.560
for cultural tourism in Oman.

00:54:24.560 --> 00:54:28.490
Bear with me, the picture
you see here is the picture

00:54:28.490 --> 00:54:32.370
of the interpretation of these
very important people in Oman.

00:54:32.370 --> 00:54:36.690
This is the site that tourists
are going to come to see,

00:54:36.690 --> 00:54:42.520
and you can see, well, it
remains open for development.

00:54:42.520 --> 00:54:46.660
Pastoralists were the majority
of people who lived in Dhofar.

00:54:46.660 --> 00:54:49.250
They did leave materials.

00:54:49.250 --> 00:54:54.670
They did leave material
remains all over the place.

00:54:54.670 --> 00:54:59.570
And, yet, there is no really
good public interpretation

00:54:59.570 --> 00:55:02.080
of ancient pastoralists
that's focused on a site

00:55:02.080 --> 00:55:03.830
where people actually were.

00:55:03.830 --> 00:55:06.140
You can go out and
look at these monuments

00:55:06.140 --> 00:55:08.640
but they don't have
interpretive signs.

00:55:08.640 --> 00:55:11.040
They don't have an
interpretive visitor center,

00:55:11.040 --> 00:55:14.210
they don't have pathways
to lead people around them

00:55:14.210 --> 00:55:17.900
and help people to understand
how they actually fit

00:55:17.900 --> 00:55:21.740
into a landscape and
a dynamic landscape,

00:55:21.740 --> 00:55:24.680
how people have shaped
the Dhofar

00:55:24.680 --> 00:55:27.510
that we can visit and see today.

00:55:27.510 --> 00:55:31.480
So, I would argue
from my very naive

00:55:31.480 --> 00:55:37.020
and amateur research
position, as a non-specialist

00:55:37.020 --> 00:55:40.200
in cultural tourism, that
there is work to be done

00:55:40.200 --> 00:55:43.730
in cultural tourism and
that this is an important

00:55:43.730 --> 00:55:46.830
and overlooked part
of Oman's heritage.

00:55:46.830 --> 00:55:49.290
So, I want -- this
is my final slide.

00:55:49.290 --> 00:55:52.140
I want to thank the
tremendous support we've had

00:55:52.140 --> 00:55:56.140
over the years, and most
importantly I'd like to thank al

00:55:56.140 --> 00:56:00.600
of the members of the teams who
have worked on various aspects

00:56:00.600 --> 00:56:05.160
of this project who this would
not have happened without you.

00:56:05.160 --> 00:56:06.960
Thank you very much.

00:56:06.960 --> 00:56:13.500
[ Applause ]

00:56:16.130 --> 00:56:18.120
&gt;&gt; Moderator: Thank
you, Dr. McCorriston,

00:56:18.120 --> 00:56:20.150
for your presentation.

00:56:20.150 --> 00:56:24.640
Our next speaker is
Dr. Michael Harrower.

00:56:24.640 --> 00:56:27.920
Michael Harrower is an associate
professor of archeology

00:56:27.920 --> 00:56:30.170
at John Hopkins University.

00:56:30.170 --> 00:56:34.220
His research is focused on
Southern Arabia since 2000,

00:56:34.220 --> 00:56:39.180
where he began his field work
in Dhofar in 2009 and 2010.

00:56:39.180 --> 00:56:42.280
He continues work in Oman
today as the director

00:56:42.280 --> 00:56:48.660
of Archeological Water
Histories of Oman or ARWHO.

00:56:48.660 --> 00:56:52.620
He is a specialist in
satellite imagery mapping

00:56:52.620 --> 00:56:58.050
and his research has been funded
by agencies including NASA,

00:56:58.050 --> 00:57:01.600
the National Science Foundation,
the Archeological Institute

00:57:01.600 --> 00:57:04.550
of America and National
Geographic.

00:57:04.550 --> 00:57:07.910
Dr. Harrower obtained
his PHD in anthropology

00:57:07.910 --> 00:57:09.250
from Ohio State University.

00:57:09.250 --> 00:57:11.050
Please welcome Dr. Harrower.

00:57:11.050 --> 00:57:15.500
[ Applause ]

00:57:23.220 --> 00:57:24.890
&gt;&gt; Dr. Michael Harrower:
Okay, thank you.

00:57:24.890 --> 00:57:30.020
Well, I'd like to start off
by saying thank you very much

00:57:30.020 --> 00:57:31.420
to the Library of Congress

00:57:31.420 --> 00:57:35.500
and to the Sultan Qaboos
Cultural Center for organizing.

00:57:35.500 --> 00:57:36.990
It's a wonderful opportunity.

00:57:36.990 --> 00:57:38.420
I'm so pleased to
be here and learn

00:57:38.420 --> 00:57:43.820
about all the excellent
work that people are doing.

00:57:43.820 --> 00:57:47.530
I just returned from Cairo
yesterday, so I'm totally

00:57:47.530 --> 00:57:49.650
on the wrong time zone.

00:57:49.650 --> 00:57:53.120
So, I've never dozed off
during one of my own talks,

00:57:53.120 --> 00:57:55.760
and I thought it was probably
not a good time to start.

00:57:55.760 --> 00:58:00.990
So, I thought I'd
use the lectern.

00:58:00.990 --> 00:58:04.280
I would just start off
by saying, you know,

00:58:04.280 --> 00:58:06.840
if we were to go out on
the street in Washington

00:58:06.840 --> 00:58:10.400
and ask somebody
about ancient Egypt

00:58:10.400 --> 00:58:13.050
and whether ancient
Egypt was important,

00:58:13.050 --> 00:58:14.410
there would be no debate, right?

00:58:14.410 --> 00:58:18.520
Everyone would say that there's
a wonderful archeological

00:58:18.520 --> 00:58:22.830
history in Egypt and it's
of global significance.

00:58:22.830 --> 00:58:26.960
But, there's less recognition
really of the tremendous work,

00:58:26.960 --> 00:58:30.300
much of which has been
presented today, about Oman,

00:58:30.300 --> 00:58:33.760
the new discoveries,
the grand history,

00:58:33.760 --> 00:58:35.510
and the really critical role

00:58:35.510 --> 00:58:38.210
in the ancient world
that Oman played.

00:58:38.210 --> 00:58:41.690
So, I'm going to speed
through today to give you kind

00:58:41.690 --> 00:58:45.920
of a little bit of a window into
work that I've been involved

00:58:45.920 --> 00:58:51.590
with over the past 20
years in Yemen and in Oman

00:58:51.590 --> 00:58:56.410
and including a kind of a
focus on my recent project

00:58:56.410 --> 00:59:00.740
that concentrates along the
border with the Emirates up here

00:59:00.740 --> 00:59:04.370
where you see Bat on
the map shown here.

00:59:04.370 --> 00:59:06.610
So, my most recent book
I kind of took a look

00:59:06.610 --> 00:59:09.750
at the long term role of water
in the history of ancient Yemen

00:59:09.750 --> 00:59:13.860
and compared that to the role
of water in American history

00:59:13.860 --> 00:59:17.600
and the settlement of the United
States and the American West.

00:59:17.600 --> 00:59:20.290
And, despite these really
obvious differences that we see,

00:59:20.290 --> 00:59:22.480
you know, in culture and
language and clothing

00:59:22.480 --> 00:59:27.070
in so many aspects, I think
what's really striking is

00:59:27.070 --> 00:59:30.710
that there are some broad
underpinning similarities

00:59:30.710 --> 00:59:33.630
between parts of the
world that we think of us

00:59:33.630 --> 00:59:36.240
as being so very different.

00:59:36.240 --> 00:59:40.020
And, this is where Oman
really to my mind is one

00:59:40.020 --> 00:59:42.860
of the most important
countries in the world today.

00:59:42.860 --> 00:59:47.120
If you think about the
issues that we face in terms

00:59:47.120 --> 00:59:52.940
of cultural understanding,
cultural interchange, war,

00:59:52.940 --> 00:59:57.760
conflict, climate change,
the real answers to a lot

00:59:57.760 --> 01:00:02.020
of those I would say, I really
try to argue this in my book,

01:00:02.020 --> 01:00:04.650
involve building a mutual
sense of understanding

01:00:04.650 --> 01:00:06.650
between people of
the world, right?

01:00:06.650 --> 01:00:11.710
A common understanding of
language, culture, history,

01:00:11.710 --> 01:00:16.690
by which we can build some
shared values and understanding

01:00:16.690 --> 01:00:18.160
of how to proceed

01:00:18.160 --> 01:00:20.550
in a cooperative way
to address these.

01:00:20.550 --> 01:00:24.890
And, this I something that Oman
has played a tremendous role

01:00:24.890 --> 01:00:27.740
in the world, and
really is a model

01:00:27.740 --> 01:00:31.300
of cultural and public
diplomacy.

01:00:31.300 --> 01:00:34.400
So, that is something I'd
really like to highlight.

01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:39.010
So, let's speed through here
and I'm going to start off

01:00:39.010 --> 01:00:42.620
with really giving you a
lightning-fast introduction

01:00:42.620 --> 01:00:45.800
to some of the periods
we're dealing with here.

01:00:45.800 --> 01:00:49.220
So, I spent a couple of years
working in Dhofar and I'm going

01:00:49.220 --> 01:00:50.560
to return to Dhofar and kind

01:00:50.560 --> 01:00:53.310
of give you some touch
stones to think about.

01:00:53.310 --> 01:00:55.660
But, most recently I've been
directing a project called the

01:00:55.660 --> 01:00:59.800
Archeological Water Histories
of Oman or the ARWHO project.

01:00:59.800 --> 01:01:01.830
And, this has been funded
over the last three years

01:01:01.830 --> 01:01:07.230
by NASA involving archeological
survey or basically exploration.

01:01:07.230 --> 01:01:11.270
And, so as part of this
exploration we really touch

01:01:11.270 --> 01:01:13.780
on all sorts of different
time periods, right?

01:01:13.780 --> 01:01:16.850
It was mentioned earlier
this morning that really some

01:01:16.850 --> 01:01:20.220
of the earliest history of human
ancestors in Oman goes back more

01:01:20.220 --> 01:01:23.360
than a million years ago,
even two million years ago

01:01:23.360 --> 01:01:25.150
in the Paleolithic period.

01:01:25.150 --> 01:01:27.130
Then we arrive into
the Neolithic period

01:01:27.130 --> 01:01:30.610
where the development of
pastoralism, agriculture,

01:01:30.610 --> 01:01:33.250
shows up, and this
is a really critical,

01:01:33.250 --> 01:01:34.980
interesting topic
for archeologists.

01:01:34.980 --> 01:01:39.160
Why did the first people engage
in agriculture and pastoralism?

01:01:39.160 --> 01:01:40.890
Then we get into this
Bronze Age period,

01:01:40.890 --> 01:01:42.190
much of which you've seen.

01:01:42.190 --> 01:01:45.490
Some of the hallmarks today have
Phi [phonetic] period tombs,

01:01:45.490 --> 01:01:48.430
Umamnar [phonetic] period
settlements and towers,

01:01:48.430 --> 01:01:50.350
and the Wadi Suq period.

01:01:50.350 --> 01:01:53.020
The Iron Age I'm going to
touch on a little bit in terms

01:01:53.020 --> 01:01:55.960
of the production of metal
and the international trade

01:01:55.960 --> 01:01:57.860
that goes on in that period.

01:01:57.860 --> 01:01:59.980
And, then of course,
the Islamic period

01:01:59.980 --> 01:02:04.000
and the crucial role played
by the political economy

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:08.730
and circumstance at that time
which leads to the impressive

01:02:08.730 --> 01:02:11.810
and rapid spread of
Islam through Arabia

01:02:11.810 --> 01:02:13.810
and throughout the world.

01:02:13.810 --> 01:02:17.860
So, about ten years ago
when I started working

01:02:17.860 --> 01:02:19.570
in northern Oman, you know,

01:02:19.570 --> 01:02:22.870
we charted out a massive
area to kind of look at.

01:02:22.870 --> 01:02:27.280
And, today there's many, many
projects working in this area,

01:02:27.280 --> 01:02:28.890
Polish teams, Dutch teams,

01:02:28.890 --> 01:02:31.520
American teams, Japanese
researchers.

01:02:31.520 --> 01:02:36.690
So, it's really exciting to see
really the knowledge of Oman

01:02:36.690 --> 01:02:38.990
and the history of Oman
change very rapidly.

01:02:38.990 --> 01:02:43.010
In addition to sort of
broad scale exploration,

01:02:43.010 --> 01:02:46.450
driving around, leaving
no stone left unturned,

01:02:46.450 --> 01:02:49.780
using satellite imagery,
talking to local peoples,

01:02:49.780 --> 01:02:53.870
we also do a sort of
statistical survey

01:02:53.870 --> 01:02:55.440
and on the righthand side here,

01:02:55.440 --> 01:03:00.610
you can see these little colored
lines represent my teams walking

01:03:00.610 --> 01:03:03.700
and surveying in a
systematic way on the ground

01:03:03.700 --> 01:03:06.440
to document everything
we find in terms

01:03:06.440 --> 01:03:09.400
of the archeological history.

01:03:09.400 --> 01:03:11.930
One of the most interesting
sites we found, Abu Sue,

01:03:11.930 --> 01:03:17.920
is north of the town Yanqul in
which we are often centered.

01:03:17.920 --> 01:03:23.140
And, I was there just recently
with a French archeologist,

01:03:23.140 --> 01:03:24.440
Dr. Remy Crusard
[assumed spelling],

01:03:24.440 --> 01:03:27.070
who's one of the leading
experts in lithics

01:03:27.070 --> 01:03:30.280
of the Arabian peninsula, and
I often get asked, you know,

01:03:30.280 --> 01:03:34.500
like what's it like to discover
something transformative?

01:03:34.500 --> 01:03:36.570
And, this is really an example
of that because I reached

01:03:36.570 --> 01:03:39.530
down into the sand,
picked up this stone tool,

01:03:39.530 --> 01:03:42.260
handed it to Remy and said,
you know, "What is it, Remy?

01:03:42.260 --> 01:03:43.560
What is it?"

01:03:43.560 --> 01:03:46.000
And, he immediately, I could
see the look on his face,

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:49.120
he got very excited because this
was a levawa [phonetic] point,

01:03:49.120 --> 01:03:52.730
something he spent really
his career studying.

01:03:52.730 --> 01:03:55.310
So, it doesn't look like
much to the untrained eye,

01:03:55.310 --> 01:03:59.460
but we know these are about
75,000 to 100,000 years old

01:03:59.460 --> 01:04:03.100
and really paint a picture
of some of the early people

01:04:03.100 --> 01:04:06.440
that are establishing themselves
in the Arabian Peninsula.

01:04:06.440 --> 01:04:09.970
Other stone tools that get
people really excited include

01:04:09.970 --> 01:04:12.200
façade, projectile
points like this one.

01:04:12.200 --> 01:04:17.190
If we think of the cusp of
how hunter-gatherers transform

01:04:17.190 --> 01:04:20.950
into pastoralists these
are sort of centered

01:04:20.950 --> 01:04:23.470
about 8000 years ago
during that period.

01:04:23.470 --> 01:04:26.340
And, we really -- the people
that produced these are very,

01:04:26.340 --> 01:04:29.910
very mysterious to us
because we don't have,

01:04:29.910 --> 01:04:34.540
as Dr. McCorriston
mentioned, really rich evidence

01:04:34.540 --> 01:04:37.100
from settlements that would tell
us about the lives of people

01:04:37.100 --> 01:04:40.210
that produced these, but they
are found widely throughout

01:04:40.210 --> 01:04:43.810
Yemen, throughout Oman,
Dhofar, and likewise.

01:04:43.810 --> 01:04:48.510
Then we get into the Neolithic
period, so these are found

01:04:48.510 --> 01:04:52.160
at a site called Wadi Olathli
[phonetic] near Yanqul, a very,

01:04:52.160 --> 01:04:54.520
very large Neolithic site.

01:04:54.520 --> 01:04:57.310
So, a couple of hectares,
a couple of football fields

01:04:57.310 --> 01:05:01.340
in size and all sorts
of types of stone tools

01:05:01.340 --> 01:05:03.720
that we can recognize
form the Neolithic period.

01:05:03.720 --> 01:05:08.990
You heard about quite a lot
today the work in Dhofar

01:05:08.990 --> 01:05:11.640
and in other parts
of Oman having to do

01:05:11.640 --> 01:05:12.940
with Bronze Age tombs.

01:05:12.940 --> 01:05:15.140
So, these are what we
might call in some parts

01:05:15.140 --> 01:05:18.560
of Oman Hafeet tombs
or Hafeet-like tombs,

01:05:18.560 --> 01:05:21.910
and these are excavations
shown here in Dhofar led

01:05:21.910 --> 01:05:26.420
by Dr. McCorriston and
skeletal analysis done

01:05:26.420 --> 01:05:29.830
by Dr. Kimberly Williams
of these types of tombs.

01:05:29.830 --> 01:05:33.150
And, they're so very interesting
to us because we find tombs

01:05:33.150 --> 01:05:36.680
of this genre throughout
the Arabian peninsula,

01:05:36.680 --> 01:05:40.350
even up into the Sinai,
throughout Yemen and Oman

01:05:40.350 --> 01:05:44.140
and they fall in the range
of about 5000 years ago

01:05:44.140 --> 01:05:48.280
to a little bit younger
in large numbers.

01:05:48.280 --> 01:05:51.030
This is another tomb from Dhofar

01:05:51.030 --> 01:05:53.950
that we found particularly
intriguing because it falls

01:05:53.950 --> 01:05:56.820
in this range of
roughly 5000 years ago.

01:05:56.820 --> 01:06:01.460
We found a couple of these
tombs in, one of them,

01:06:01.460 --> 01:06:03.930
the first one discovered
was found in Wadi Halluf

01:06:03.930 --> 01:06:05.560
and that's how it get's
the name Halluf tomb.

01:06:05.560 --> 01:06:10.220
And, one of the interesting
things we found

01:06:10.220 --> 01:06:12.660
in this tomb is a dagger

01:06:12.660 --> 01:06:17.020
that actually Professor
McCorriston showed you some

01:06:17.020 --> 01:06:20.860
slides on, and really thoughtful
archeologists debate the,

01:06:20.860 --> 01:06:23.870
you know, the chronology of
this tomb, the chronology

01:06:23.870 --> 01:06:26.960
of this dagger, how did this
dagger wind up in this tomb?

01:06:26.960 --> 01:06:30.170
Oman is really famous
for copper production

01:06:30.170 --> 01:06:35.240
so at the very early end
we're looking at about 3200 BC

01:06:35.240 --> 01:06:37.010
when Hafeet tombs
start to show up

01:06:37.010 --> 01:06:40.380
and we find copper
production happening

01:06:40.380 --> 01:06:46.070
and these are really exciting
for us to think about, you know?

01:06:46.070 --> 01:06:48.220
Where did the copper
from for that dagger?

01:06:48.220 --> 01:06:52.000
How did it find its
way into that tomb.

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:56.130
During the Umamnar period we
find some really impressive

01:06:56.130 --> 01:06:58.640
towers developed and there's
been a lot of work on these.

01:06:58.640 --> 01:07:02.550
There's more than 60 or
70 towers been documented

01:07:02.550 --> 01:07:05.290
by Dr. Charlotte
Cable, Chris Thornton,

01:07:05.290 --> 01:07:07.750
and others throughout
Oman's history.

01:07:07.750 --> 01:07:09.830
This one is one we worked
on quite extensively

01:07:09.830 --> 01:07:13.460
and what's intriguing, all
those this is 180 kilometers

01:07:13.460 --> 01:07:17.410
from the coast, it's got a
pictograph on it of a boat.

01:07:17.410 --> 01:07:21.090
And, we're really interested
to think about how the people

01:07:21.090 --> 01:07:24.200
of this inland area were in
connection with the coastline,

01:07:24.200 --> 01:07:28.520
were trading, were domesticating
animals and whatnot.

01:07:28.520 --> 01:07:31.400
And, these tombs are closely
associated with water,

01:07:31.400 --> 01:07:36.260
and this is sort of a
hallmark of tombs and towers.

01:07:36.260 --> 01:07:38.500
This is a well in the
middle of this tower.

01:07:38.500 --> 01:07:41.210
So, we did quite a bit of work
reconstructing the landscape

01:07:41.210 --> 01:07:42.510
around Yanqul.

01:07:42.510 --> 01:07:44.310
This is satellite imagery
and topographic data

01:07:44.310 --> 01:07:49.570
and this orange areas here
are showing the vegetation

01:07:49.570 --> 01:07:52.660
around Yanqul and
the Date Palm Oasis.

01:07:52.660 --> 01:07:55.170
This is some of our
publications of that work;.

01:07:55.170 --> 01:07:57.700
And, we did some
three D modeling.

01:07:57.700 --> 01:07:59.000
This is something

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:00.870
that archeologists
have just really taken

01:08:00.870 --> 01:08:04.410
up with a tremendous
passion in the past few years

01:08:04.410 --> 01:08:08.190
because this technology has
become vastly less expensive.

01:08:08.190 --> 01:08:12.020
And, so we did some three D
modeling of this tower to try

01:08:12.020 --> 01:08:15.220
to understand its construction.

01:08:15.220 --> 01:08:17.370
We did a whole bunch of
on the ground modeling.

01:08:17.370 --> 01:08:19.490
So, one of the things we
realized is this town was

01:08:19.490 --> 01:08:22.520
constructed by blocks that
are almost as big as one

01:08:22.520 --> 01:08:26.060
of the tables up here
of the -- at the podium.

01:08:26.060 --> 01:08:31.250
And, they're just enormously
heavy and it's so interesting

01:08:31.250 --> 01:08:32.660
to think about how
these were moved,

01:08:32.660 --> 01:08:34.120
but one of the things
that's an advantage

01:08:34.120 --> 01:08:37.290
to us is these blocks
are so heavy, excuse me,

01:08:37.290 --> 01:08:39.280
that most of them
that are fallen

01:08:39.280 --> 01:08:41.060
over didn't get very far away.

01:08:41.060 --> 01:08:43.520
So, all these little black
dots are blocks that we mapped

01:08:43.520 --> 01:08:47.660
on the ground to try to
understand how this tomb

01:08:47.660 --> 01:08:52.980
over the time, over the past
4500 years has deteriorated

01:08:52.980 --> 01:08:58.950
and then I had some
colleagues, an architect,

01:08:58.950 --> 01:09:04.600
and students reconstruct this
using the drawing of the tomb

01:09:04.600 --> 01:09:07.660
in sort of a digital game
of Lego here putting all

01:09:07.660 --> 01:09:10.300
of these little blocks,
measured blocks back to try

01:09:10.300 --> 01:09:13.290
to reconstruct the
height of this tower,

01:09:13.290 --> 01:09:17.840
which we estimate stands
about eight meters tall.

01:09:17.840 --> 01:09:20.110
Nearby, returning to
the site of Abu Sue,

01:09:20.110 --> 01:09:22.710
we found some other
interesting things

01:09:22.710 --> 01:09:24.900
from this Umamnar
Bronze Age period.

01:09:24.900 --> 01:09:29.180
We were there in 2012 and
documented some Umamnar tombs.

01:09:29.180 --> 01:09:31.940
These are not something that
the untrained eye would get

01:09:31.940 --> 01:09:33.410
excited about.

01:09:33.410 --> 01:09:36.050
Really if you weren't carefully
looking walking right over top

01:09:36.050 --> 01:09:40.890
of this without really
noticing it was significant.

01:09:40.890 --> 01:09:44.650
And, one of the things
that really was touched

01:09:44.650 --> 01:09:45.950
on throughout a number

01:09:45.950 --> 01:09:48.280
of the talks today is the
challenges archeologists face

01:09:48.280 --> 01:09:51.110
in Oman and really around
the world, sort of trying

01:09:51.110 --> 01:09:53.810
to preserve and protect
cultural heritage, right?

01:09:53.810 --> 01:09:58.960
And, so quite unfortunately
despite our efforts, these --

01:09:58.960 --> 01:10:02.590
number of tombs in this
area were bulldozed, right?

01:10:02.590 --> 01:10:06.820
And, so a big part of our work
is sort of public outreach or,

01:10:06.820 --> 01:10:12.140
you know, education having to do
with the archeological history.

01:10:12.140 --> 01:10:17.530
And, the, you know, development
in Oman is proceeding

01:10:17.530 --> 01:10:18.990
at such a rapid pace, right,

01:10:18.990 --> 01:10:22.910
that one of our challenges
is just reaching

01:10:22.910 --> 01:10:25.940
out to local communities
and trying to work very hard

01:10:25.940 --> 01:10:29.810
at sign boarding and protecting
some of this material.

01:10:29.810 --> 01:10:32.430
And, these are some of
the objects that came

01:10:32.430 --> 01:10:34.090
out of these tombs, right?

01:10:34.090 --> 01:10:38.020
So, really some tremendous
material.

01:10:38.020 --> 01:10:42.840
This is some soft stone
vessel pottery, shell,

01:10:42.840 --> 01:10:46.290
and other materials, and
it's a running battle really

01:10:46.290 --> 01:10:48.920
to preserve and save
some of this

01:10:48.920 --> 01:10:52.080
that we're working very hard
on with the Omani Ministry

01:10:52.080 --> 01:10:53.570
of Heritage and Culture.

01:10:53.570 --> 01:10:57.160
One of the things Oman is really
famous for, of course, is copper

01:10:57.160 --> 01:10:58.880
and bronze production.

01:10:58.880 --> 01:11:00.350
So, the Bronze Age and later,

01:11:00.350 --> 01:11:03.190
not surprisingly,
is known for bronze.

01:11:03.190 --> 01:11:07.460
This shows you some raw copper,
but usually most of the copper

01:11:07.460 --> 01:11:11.360
in Oman comes in the form
of copper in minerals

01:11:11.360 --> 01:11:13.580
that are found throughout Oman.

01:11:13.580 --> 01:11:19.100
And, while today mining
companies and modern production

01:11:19.100 --> 01:11:20.400
of copper is in search

01:11:20.400 --> 01:11:23.170
of big commercially
viable deposits, right?

01:11:23.170 --> 01:11:26.050
They're not interested in
small quantities of copper,

01:11:26.050 --> 01:11:29.080
but something we
can really develop

01:11:29.080 --> 01:11:31.030
as a commercial enterprise.

01:11:31.030 --> 01:11:33.240
Archeologists on the
other hand are interested

01:11:33.240 --> 01:11:36.860
in the really smaller
quantities of copper

01:11:36.860 --> 01:11:38.910
that people have been exploiting

01:11:38.910 --> 01:11:41.270
and trading throughout
the Middle East

01:11:41.270 --> 01:11:43.760
for at least 5000 years.

01:11:43.760 --> 01:11:45.690
And, a large part of our work

01:11:45.690 --> 01:11:48.660
with NASA satellite
imagery includes work

01:11:48.660 --> 01:11:49.960
with hyperspectral imagery

01:11:49.960 --> 01:11:53.840
from this satellite
here called Hyperion.

01:11:53.840 --> 01:11:57.870
That is akin to having
240 different pictures

01:11:57.870 --> 01:11:59.710
of different wavelengths
of light on the ground.

01:11:59.710 --> 01:12:03.510
So, this can tell you a lot
about what you're looking

01:12:03.510 --> 01:12:05.230
at in terms of the geology.

01:12:05.230 --> 01:12:09.560
And, so while we've long
known for a very long period

01:12:09.560 --> 01:12:12.420
of time the geological
formations in Oman

01:12:12.420 --> 01:12:16.660
that yields copper, what is much
more challenging to do is to try

01:12:16.660 --> 01:12:19.860
to pinpoint where the copper
bearing minerals showing

01:12:19.860 --> 01:12:22.620
on this map, how
they're distributed

01:12:22.620 --> 01:12:24.750
and how people were using them.

01:12:24.750 --> 01:12:26.260
And, one of the things
we've really learned is

01:12:26.260 --> 01:12:28.850
that it's not only the
presence of copper.

01:12:28.850 --> 01:12:33.710
But, it's also the presence
of water to grow the food,

01:12:33.710 --> 01:12:36.860
to supply the people doing
this copper production,

01:12:36.860 --> 01:12:40.200
and also the presence of
trees to produce the charcoal

01:12:40.200 --> 01:12:42.340
to smelt this copper, right?

01:12:42.340 --> 01:12:47.830
So, as was mentioned earlier
today, the search of trees

01:12:47.830 --> 01:12:51.480
to make the charcoal
is very, very important

01:12:51.480 --> 01:12:53.700
from the Bronze Age and
especially into the Iron Age

01:12:53.700 --> 01:12:57.090
where you have hundreds
of thousands of tons

01:12:57.090 --> 01:12:58.900
in the Iron Age in
Islamic period

01:12:58.900 --> 01:13:03.400
of copper slag being
produced in Oman.

01:13:03.400 --> 01:13:06.060
One of the sites that
was discovered a handful

01:13:06.060 --> 01:13:08.870
of years back that's really
critical in this regard

01:13:08.870 --> 01:13:11.450
in revealing just some of
the astonishing things going

01:13:11.450 --> 01:13:14.090
on in terms of copper
production is Saffah [phonetic]

01:13:14.090 --> 01:13:17.360
or Ugdat Al-Baqarah and this is

01:13:17.360 --> 01:13:20.530
about 30 kilometers
into the desert.

01:13:20.530 --> 01:13:23.740
Was discovered on the edge
of the Rubahali [phonetic]

01:13:23.740 --> 01:13:27.750
in the desert sand dunes and
there's hundreds and hundreds

01:13:27.750 --> 01:13:32.620
of furnaces or pits
being identified first

01:13:32.620 --> 01:13:35.670
by Italian research and the
Ministry of Heritage and Culture

01:13:35.670 --> 01:13:40.480
in this area and hundreds and
hundreds of bronze objects

01:13:40.480 --> 01:13:42.600
like this dagger shown here.

01:13:42.600 --> 01:13:47.480
A lot of these are now -- a
potion of these are on display

01:13:47.480 --> 01:13:49.820
in the new Oman National Museum.

01:13:49.820 --> 01:13:53.410
And, one of the really
intriguing questions

01:13:53.410 --> 01:13:58.630
about this material and these
images are from the archives

01:13:58.630 --> 01:14:01.000
of the Oman Ministry of
Heritage and Culture,

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:08.210
is just the impressive quantity
of different material, daggers,

01:14:08.210 --> 01:14:13.340
axes, bowls, and other material
that came out of this area

01:14:13.340 --> 01:14:17.880
and been subject to
work by German, Italian,

01:14:17.880 --> 01:14:21.720
and variety of different
international teams.

01:14:21.720 --> 01:14:26.870
And, so I'm really
indebted to them

01:14:26.870 --> 01:14:31.820
for their impressive
work on this material.

01:14:31.820 --> 01:14:37.630
And, this is really akin, when
I think about explaining this

01:14:37.630 --> 01:14:41.310
to my students, I oftentimes say
this is akin to being, you know,

01:14:41.310 --> 01:14:44.730
camping out in the desert, and
let's say or argument's sake,

01:14:44.730 --> 01:14:46.030
you were camping
out in the desert

01:14:46.030 --> 01:14:49.200
and you had a thousand iPhones.

01:14:49.200 --> 01:14:52.570
In a sense this was what
an iPhone is to us now.

01:14:52.570 --> 01:14:54.350
It's something incredibly
valuable, right?

01:14:54.350 --> 01:14:56.540
An d, if you have had,
for argument's sake,

01:14:56.540 --> 01:14:58.830
a thousand iPhones, I don't
know how you'd have a thousand

01:14:58.830 --> 01:15:02.730
iPhones, but say in a cardboard
box or a backpack or you knows.

01:15:02.730 --> 01:15:04.670
You had a thousand iPhones.

01:15:04.670 --> 01:15:05.970
You were camping
out in the desert

01:15:05.970 --> 01:15:09.220
and somehow you were forced
to flee really quickly.

01:15:09.220 --> 01:15:12.420
Maybe there's a sandstorm or
you were attacked and you had

01:15:12.420 --> 01:15:15.120
to run away really fast, right?

01:15:15.120 --> 01:15:19.420
What most likely you do is go
back and find that material

01:15:19.420 --> 01:15:22.700
or whoever attacked you
would want to keep it

01:15:22.700 --> 01:15:26.480
or you would go back the next
week or month or a period

01:15:26.480 --> 01:15:28.580
of time later and
retrieve it, right?

01:15:28.580 --> 01:15:32.470
For some strange reason, in
this case, that never happened

01:15:32.470 --> 01:15:36.370
and this perhaps was
buried deeply in a sandstorm

01:15:36.370 --> 01:15:39.990
that maybe transformed the
landscape so dramatically

01:15:39.990 --> 01:15:41.810
that people were
unable to find the spot.

01:15:41.810 --> 01:15:46.340
Or, for whatever reason this
material wasn't retrieved

01:15:46.340 --> 01:15:47.970
from this desert area.

01:15:47.970 --> 01:15:49.920
So, our work at the
site is really focused

01:15:49.920 --> 01:15:51.220
in on satellite imagery.

01:15:51.220 --> 01:15:54.780
We're using Japanese,
German, Canadian radar.

01:15:54.780 --> 01:15:57.920
We're using GPR, ground
penetrating radar,

01:15:57.920 --> 01:16:01.520
to try to understand where
people were living at this site,

01:16:01.520 --> 01:16:04.670
where were they getting
water, why were they out here

01:16:04.670 --> 01:16:07.330
in the middle of the desert.

01:16:07.330 --> 01:16:11.170
The really impressive advantage
of satellite radar and radar

01:16:11.170 --> 01:16:12.910
in general is it
has the capability

01:16:12.910 --> 01:16:14.960
to penetrate beneath the ground.

01:16:14.960 --> 01:16:17.860
So, especially in
really dry sand,

01:16:17.860 --> 01:16:20.170
radar waves can penetrate
very, very deeply

01:16:20.170 --> 01:16:22.140
and give you an image of
what's underneath the ground

01:16:22.140 --> 01:16:23.730
without having to dig.

01:16:23.730 --> 01:16:30.050
So, we had a team out in 2017
at Saffah, doing magnetometry

01:16:30.050 --> 01:16:32.520
and ground penetrating
radar in the area

01:16:32.520 --> 01:16:35.630
that was documented
previously by an Italian team.

01:16:35.630 --> 01:16:40.260
And, we've documented many,
many of these furnaces or pits

01:16:40.260 --> 01:16:41.760
that weren't visible
on the surface.

01:16:41.760 --> 01:16:43.980
So, there's hundreds and
hundreds of them on the surface.

01:16:43.980 --> 01:16:49.590
There's hundreds and
hundreds more of them --

01:16:49.590 --> 01:16:52.070
underneath the surface of the
ground and these bowtie type

01:16:52.070 --> 01:16:55.100
of reflections are what
you get when radar waves go

01:16:55.100 --> 01:16:57.880
down into the ground
and bounce back up.

01:16:57.880 --> 01:17:01.480
The other thing we noted
is that you think, well,

01:17:01.480 --> 01:17:03.350
this is in the middle of
the desert sand dunes.

01:17:03.350 --> 01:17:05.990
Where in the world could
they be getting their water?

01:17:05.990 --> 01:17:08.770
One of the things
we recognized in GPR

01:17:08.770 --> 01:17:12.300
and in satellite radar is there
is actually a drainage going

01:17:12.300 --> 01:17:14.220
right through the
middle of this site.

01:17:14.220 --> 01:17:18.220
Not now, but 3000 years ago
when this site was occupied,

01:17:18.220 --> 01:17:19.900
there was water and
probably tress

01:17:19.900 --> 01:17:22.810
and that may give us a clue
to why they're out here.

01:17:22.810 --> 01:17:30.620
Maybe they're using these pits
to produce charcoal that is used

01:17:30.620 --> 01:17:32.000
in the smelting or the melting

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.080
or the production
of this material.

01:17:34.080 --> 01:17:36.850
And, we dug a number
of different trenches

01:17:36.850 --> 01:17:41.870
in these red polygons
in early 2018.

01:17:41.870 --> 01:17:44.910
These are examples of the
pits that we see in radar,

01:17:44.910 --> 01:17:46.730
quite modest, small,
little pits.

01:17:46.730 --> 01:17:51.610
These are four by
four excavations,

01:17:51.610 --> 01:17:57.630
and we also did a trench across
the drainage that we identified,

01:17:57.630 --> 01:18:01.220
the sort of natural small
stream running through the site

01:18:01.220 --> 01:18:03.240
and this is flanked by pits.

01:18:03.240 --> 01:18:05.510
And, what's really
interesting, too,

01:18:05.510 --> 01:18:10.060
is this drawing shows a
cross-section of this channel is

01:18:10.060 --> 01:18:14.910
that there's pits there that
are covered over by water flow

01:18:14.910 --> 01:18:17.580
and by some of this
water laden sand.

01:18:17.580 --> 01:18:22.370
So, we know that not only there
was water flow before people

01:18:22.370 --> 01:18:24.500
arrived there but actually
there was water flow

01:18:24.500 --> 01:18:26.860
in that desert area even after

01:18:26.860 --> 01:18:30.820
or intermittently while
people were burning charcoal

01:18:30.820 --> 01:18:36.810
or using furnaces or involved

01:18:36.810 --> 01:18:41.400
in either massive scale food
production or metal production.

01:18:41.400 --> 01:18:45.480
We're also collaborating with
Professor Kneuer [phonetic]

01:18:45.480 --> 01:18:48.700
that he gave you a wonderful
presentation earlier today

01:18:48.700 --> 01:18:50.000
on beads.

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.520
So, this is a bead we
retrieved from the surface.

01:18:52.520 --> 01:18:54.900
We're very interested in the
trade connections not only

01:18:54.900 --> 01:18:57.040
of where the bronze
material comes from

01:18:57.040 --> 01:19:03.450
but whether we can situate the
location of the carnelian used

01:19:03.450 --> 01:19:07.200
to produce this bead and
another one like it that's now

01:19:07.200 --> 01:19:09.600
in the national museum.

01:19:09.600 --> 01:19:14.220
Another really critical piece of
work we're working on in terms

01:19:14.220 --> 01:19:17.550
of trade is a site we discovered

01:19:17.550 --> 01:19:21.660
in 2015 called the Ker Al-Shamus
[phonetic] and this was

01:19:21.660 --> 01:19:23.760
in close cooperation
with the ministry

01:19:23.760 --> 01:19:25.060
of heritage and culture.

01:19:25.060 --> 01:19:26.860
This is showing you
this small village

01:19:26.860 --> 01:19:29.950
on a very tight bend in a wadi.

01:19:29.950 --> 01:19:32.940
And, there's some of
the buildings here,

01:19:32.940 --> 01:19:36.590
and what this site is
really amazing and important

01:19:36.590 --> 01:19:39.020
for is being the first discovery

01:19:39.020 --> 01:19:43.200
of soft stone chloride vessel
production known in Oman.

01:19:43.200 --> 01:19:45.610
So, in fact known in Arabia.

01:19:45.610 --> 01:19:47.790
So, prior to this time, we know

01:19:47.790 --> 01:19:52.420
that really amazing material
made of out this soft stone,

01:19:52.420 --> 01:19:56.250
you know, the layman's term in
English for this is soapstone

01:19:56.250 --> 01:19:59.150
and it's almost got
a soft, soapy feel.

01:19:59.150 --> 01:20:01.050
And, we know in in the
Bronze Ave and Iron Age,

01:20:01.050 --> 01:20:03.430
Iran was a major center
point of production

01:20:03.430 --> 01:20:08.110
of really glorious vessels,
many of them now in museums,

01:20:08.110 --> 01:20:10.080
produced out of this
type of stone.

01:20:10.080 --> 01:20:11.780
Archeologists have
known for decades

01:20:11.780 --> 01:20:16.550
that the geological conditions
are right for the mining

01:20:16.550 --> 01:20:17.850
of this type of material.

01:20:17.850 --> 01:20:20.420
But, prior to the
discovery of Ker Al-Shamus,

01:20:20.420 --> 01:20:23.090
we never found evidence

01:20:23.090 --> 01:20:27.880
of people actually making
this stuff and trading it on.

01:20:27.880 --> 01:20:31.250
So, while these pictures
look really rough and none

01:20:31.250 --> 01:20:35.620
of this material is really going
to find your way on display,

01:20:35.620 --> 01:20:38.350
you know, on a prominent
display in a museum,

01:20:38.350 --> 01:20:41.410
these are really scientifically
so interesting to us

01:20:41.410 --> 01:20:44.890
because they're roughed
out, early shapes of vessels

01:20:44.890 --> 01:20:48.870
that were carved into
elaborately decorated examples.

01:20:48.870 --> 01:20:53.530
So, we're starting to learn
about the geological knowledge

01:20:53.530 --> 01:20:56.310
of these ancient people,
how they're mining this,

01:20:56.310 --> 01:20:59.960
chiseling this, polishing
it down, working it,

01:20:59.960 --> 01:21:03.150
smoothing it, shaping it.

01:21:03.150 --> 01:21:06.920
And, we've got a paper, another
paper just in the final stages

01:21:06.920 --> 01:21:11.170
of revision where we used
Hyperion hyperspectral satellite

01:21:11.170 --> 01:21:16.560
imagery to go searching for the
source of the mine that was used

01:21:16.560 --> 01:21:20.870
to collect this material

01:21:20.870 --> 01:21:25.090
and we've got some really
interesting analysis showing

01:21:25.090 --> 01:21:27.600
that a few, about
an hour's walk away,

01:21:27.600 --> 01:21:32.220
up a very steep mountainous
wadi, people were mining

01:21:32.220 --> 01:21:34.580
and collecting this material.

01:21:34.580 --> 01:21:39.660
Coming back to Dhofar,
really one of the things

01:21:39.660 --> 01:21:42.070
that Dhofar is really famous
for are these triliths

01:21:42.070 --> 01:21:44.670
that were also touched
on earlier today.

01:21:44.670 --> 01:21:47.330
We've learned a little
bit more about these,

01:21:47.330 --> 01:21:49.120
but they really remain one

01:21:49.120 --> 01:21:53.440
of the most mysterious
small-scale monuments in Arabia

01:21:53.440 --> 01:21:56.270
and these are sort of
centered in Dhofar, right?

01:21:56.270 --> 01:22:00.260
The densest, most abundant
examples of these are in Dhofar.

01:22:00.260 --> 01:22:03.570
There's quite a number of them
in eastern Yemen in Hadhramaut,

01:22:03.570 --> 01:22:07.420
there's some in Charkia
[phonetic], there are some --

01:22:07.420 --> 01:22:10.260
there's a handful of
ones in northern Oman.

01:22:10.260 --> 01:22:14.150
And, we know that likely
the people that are involved

01:22:14.150 --> 01:22:17.760
in the early camel caravans
and trade routes and networks

01:22:17.760 --> 01:22:22.150
that connect the Arabian
Peninsula are stopping at these

01:22:22.150 --> 01:22:26.620
or involved in some kind of
use of these early monuments

01:22:26.620 --> 01:22:33.900
and probably that may
include trade in frankincense.

01:22:33.900 --> 01:22:37.540
And, many of you might not know
that there's a running rivalry

01:22:37.540 --> 01:22:44.020
between Canada and Oman for the
most valuable form of tree sap.

01:22:44.020 --> 01:22:50.310
So, Canada of course, the home
of maple syrup, has, you know,

01:22:50.310 --> 01:22:53.540
a really lucrative
trade in maple syrup.

01:22:53.540 --> 01:22:58.890
But, in ancient Oman, it's
number one in terms of the trade

01:22:58.890 --> 01:23:02.010
of this impressive form
of tree sap, frankincense,

01:23:02.010 --> 01:23:06.520
that led to the kingdoms and
the civilizations becoming

01:23:06.520 --> 01:23:09.180
extraordinarily wealthy trading
this throughout the world

01:23:09.180 --> 01:23:10.950
to Egypt, the Mediterranean,

01:23:10.950 --> 01:23:14.680
to the Roman world
throughout this period of time.

01:23:14.680 --> 01:23:17.440
So, I'll conclude just
with some acknowledgements,

01:23:17.440 --> 01:23:20.450
most prominently the Ministry
of Heritage and Culture

01:23:20.450 --> 01:23:23.930
which has been so gracious
to us in permitting

01:23:23.930 --> 01:23:25.740
and supporting our research.

01:23:25.740 --> 01:23:29.700
Professor McCorriston who was
my mentor as a graduate student

01:23:29.700 --> 01:23:34.120
and has really played a
tremendous role in sort

01:23:34.120 --> 01:23:37.080
of training and mentoring
me throughout my career.

01:23:37.080 --> 01:23:40.270
Ohio State University,
I really can't go

01:23:40.270 --> 01:23:44.270
on to thank enough the
very large number of people

01:23:44.270 --> 01:23:47.640
that have been involved in
this work over the years.

01:23:47.640 --> 01:23:51.780
And, the individuals with the
Ministry of Heritage and Culture

01:23:51.780 --> 01:23:54.450
at John Hopkins University,
of course NASA

01:23:54.450 --> 01:23:56.910
for funding support
for this work.

01:23:56.910 --> 01:23:59.790
And, of course, the people
of the Sultanate of Oman,

01:23:59.790 --> 01:24:04.240
which have been so tremendously
friendly and gracious

01:24:04.240 --> 01:24:09.970
and welcoming us and helping us
learn about the amazing history

01:24:09.970 --> 01:24:11.280
of this tremendous region.

01:24:11.280 --> 01:24:13.080
So, thank you very much.

01:24:13.080 --> 01:24:20.710
[ Applause ]

01:24:20.710 --> 01:24:22.050
&gt;&gt; Moderator: Thank
you, Dr. Harrower,

01:24:22.050 --> 01:24:25.230
and indeed the whole panel,
such wonderful presentations.

01:24:25.230 --> 01:24:27.670
We have a few minutes
for some questions.

01:24:27.670 --> 01:24:29.970
So--

01:24:33.630 --> 01:24:34.930
&gt;&gt; Audience Member:
Well, thank you all.

01:24:34.930 --> 01:24:38.510
That was really a very,
very exciting panel.

01:24:38.510 --> 01:24:39.810
I have a question.

01:24:39.810 --> 01:24:49.570
Everyone has been speaking out
the copper and copper smelting

01:24:49.570 --> 01:24:52.200
and the trade in copper.

01:24:52.200 --> 01:24:55.440
And, yet when one talks

01:24:55.440 --> 01:25:01.970
about material objects very
little is said about any

01:25:01.970 --> 01:25:04.970
of them being made of copper.

01:25:04.970 --> 01:25:11.510
I'm wondering why, or in
what form was the copper used

01:25:11.510 --> 01:25:13.970
in the region?

01:25:21.680 --> 01:25:23.150
&gt;&gt; Dr. Michael Harrower:
Yeah, this is really one

01:25:23.150 --> 01:25:26.920
of the most fascinating
aspects of Omani archaeology

01:25:26.920 --> 01:25:28.540
and Omani history
being, you know,

01:25:28.540 --> 01:25:32.880
one of the ancient world's most
prominent sources of copper.

01:25:32.880 --> 01:25:35.830
So, we know through
an understanding

01:25:35.830 --> 01:25:39.100
of even modern copper mining
and production in Oman today

01:25:39.100 --> 01:25:43.310
that the Al-Hajar Mountains
are really a rich source

01:25:43.310 --> 01:25:46.030
of this material.

01:25:46.030 --> 01:25:50.660
How that originally gets started
during the early Bronze Age is a

01:25:50.660 --> 01:25:54.000
matter of a lot of
research and a lot of study.

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:58.680
How people learned to, you
know, create the furnaces

01:25:58.680 --> 01:26:04.070
and the temperatures to melt
this, to alloy it together

01:26:04.070 --> 01:26:07.320
with other metals
like arsenic and tin.

01:26:07.320 --> 01:26:13.820
And, so there's some
tremendous research involved

01:26:13.820 --> 01:26:16.750
in that early study.

01:26:16.750 --> 01:26:19.830
We know that perhaps they were
boring on some technologies

01:26:19.830 --> 01:26:22.530
that were used to make
pottery in kilns, right,

01:26:22.530 --> 01:26:24.440
to produce the temperatures
to fire pottery

01:26:24.440 --> 01:26:27.260
and maybe elaborated from that.

01:26:27.260 --> 01:26:29.130
Oman, as it was mentioned
earlier,

01:26:29.130 --> 01:26:32.780
is really a center point of
trade and interconnectivity,

01:26:32.780 --> 01:26:36.570
so they were drawing on
interaction and knowledge

01:26:36.570 --> 01:26:43.030
and technology from a
variety of different sources.

01:26:43.030 --> 01:26:48.890
But, it's an ongoing
real mystery about where

01:26:48.890 --> 01:26:55.300
that technology and know-how
originates and spreads.

01:26:55.300 --> 01:26:59.620
&gt;&gt; Dr. Krista Lewis: If I
could just add one little point

01:26:59.620 --> 01:27:00.920
to that.

01:27:00.920 --> 01:27:02.220
If I understood the question,

01:27:02.220 --> 01:27:05.580
is why are the objects
not made of copper?

01:27:05.580 --> 01:27:10.030
Copper is one of the
constituents of bronze,

01:27:10.030 --> 01:27:12.990
so the copper was
in the objects,

01:27:12.990 --> 01:27:16.940
but they had another
level of the technology

01:27:16.940 --> 01:27:23.320
that is still being studied
to transform that raw material

01:27:23.320 --> 01:27:25.080
into a harder material.

01:27:25.080 --> 01:27:27.970
When you alloy it it
becomes much harder.

01:27:32.040 --> 01:27:33.940
&gt;&gt; Audience Member: Yes,
a question for Dr. Lewis.

01:27:33.940 --> 01:27:37.440
You had a illustration of
numerous objects that have been

01:27:37.440 --> 01:27:41.330
on Earth, and one was a small
brass coin with a square center,

01:27:41.330 --> 01:27:43.950
appears to be probably
Chinese origin.

01:27:43.950 --> 01:27:47.910
Have you made a determination
as to the date of this coin,

01:27:47.910 --> 01:27:50.220
the emperor of China
that it represents,

01:27:50.220 --> 01:27:52.510
and any other significance
it might have?

01:27:52.510 --> 01:28:02.140
[ Inaudible ]

01:28:02.140 --> 01:28:06.180
&gt;&gt; Dr. Krista Lewis: Okay, that
particular coin was excavated

01:28:06.180 --> 01:28:09.040
by one of the previous
archaeologists at the site,

01:28:09.040 --> 01:28:12.930
so I'm actually not sure if
that particular coin has a date.

01:28:12.930 --> 01:28:15.560
I mean, one of the challenges
with all of the coins

01:28:15.560 --> 01:28:18.470
that are coming from this site
is they're highly corroded,

01:28:18.470 --> 01:28:20.070
because they were
right on the sea side.

01:28:20.070 --> 01:28:23.880
And, so the metal, which is
often in bad shape as we've seen

01:28:23.880 --> 01:28:25.180
from archaeological sites,

01:28:25.180 --> 01:28:27.550
and this site is
particularly damaged.

01:28:27.550 --> 01:28:29.960
So, it's really difficult
to actually get,

01:28:29.960 --> 01:28:31.730
even once they're
chemically cleaned,

01:28:31.730 --> 01:28:34.500
to be able to identify
the markings on it.

01:28:34.500 --> 01:28:37.310
So, a lot of the coins
are identified more based

01:28:37.310 --> 01:28:39.240
on their shape and
general material,

01:28:39.240 --> 01:28:47.730
but the inscriptions are not
always easy to read I guess.

01:28:47.730 --> 01:28:50.670
&gt;&gt; Moderator: Well,
I have a question.

01:28:50.670 --> 01:28:54.370
From this panel and the
previous panel, it's obvious

01:28:54.370 --> 01:28:57.740
that the world has been
interconnected for quite --

01:28:57.740 --> 01:28:59.680
for thousands of years.

01:28:59.680 --> 01:29:02.300
How typical is Oman
for that region as far

01:29:02.300 --> 01:29:05.940
as being the cross roads
of trade and so forth?

01:29:05.940 --> 01:29:07.240
Like, how does it compare

01:29:07.240 --> 01:29:09.840
to neighboring countries
or neighboring--

01:29:09.840 --> 01:29:13.050
&gt;&gt; Dr. Krista Lewis: A typical?

01:29:13.050 --> 01:29:16.510
&gt;&gt; I mean, is it an
extreme example or is it a--

01:29:16.510 --> 01:29:23.140
[ Inaudible ]

01:29:23.140 --> 01:29:25.510
&gt;&gt; Dr. Krista Lewis: I think
I would answer by saying

01:29:25.510 --> 01:29:29.760
that we see -- we've
seen a lot of traffic

01:29:29.760 --> 01:29:33.840
across different
cultural groups.

01:29:33.840 --> 01:29:36.450
One of the things that has
struck me, and I come back

01:29:36.450 --> 01:29:39.930
to my point about
pastoralists being the majority

01:29:39.930 --> 01:29:45.560
of the Omanis who've lived,
is that some of those sites

01:29:45.560 --> 01:29:49.280
that we're looking
at show no evidence,

01:29:49.280 --> 01:29:52.290
or limited evidence,
of interaction.

01:29:52.290 --> 01:29:53.790
So, I think it's very variable

01:29:53.790 --> 01:29:57.880
across the different populations
whether they were on the coast

01:29:57.880 --> 01:30:01.530
or inland or mobile or settled.

01:30:01.530 --> 01:30:03.500
I think you would find a
great deal of variability,

01:30:03.500 --> 01:30:06.830
as you would in some of
the surrounding regions.

01:30:06.830 --> 01:30:10.400
Probably Dr. Kneuer could answer

01:30:10.400 --> 01:30:14.970
that about the Indus
area as well.

01:30:18.040 --> 01:30:21.050
&gt;&gt; Dr. Michael Harrower: Yeah,
to sort of respond a little bit

01:30:21.050 --> 01:30:22.650
to that, I mean,

01:30:22.650 --> 01:30:24.590
in a contemporary world
people are really interested

01:30:24.590 --> 01:30:25.890
in globalization, right?

01:30:25.890 --> 01:30:28.060
What are the forces
that have created the

01:30:28.060 --> 01:30:29.360
interconnected world?

01:30:29.360 --> 01:30:32.510
And, we think of social
networks and social media

01:30:32.510 --> 01:30:35.420
and the internet as
interconnecting the world.

01:30:35.420 --> 01:30:41.470
And, in a different way that
also happens in the past, right?

01:30:41.470 --> 01:30:43.410
And, archaeologists
are also interested

01:30:43.410 --> 01:30:46.330
in ancient globalization
and ancient social networks.

01:30:46.330 --> 01:30:50.050
Like, what are the
forces early on that lead

01:30:50.050 --> 01:30:54.410
to interconnectivity
up and down the gulf?

01:30:54.410 --> 01:30:59.910
What are the economic,
political, religious forces

01:30:59.910 --> 01:31:03.800
that shape the ancient
middle east, right?

01:31:03.800 --> 01:31:06.350
And, there's a tremendous
amount to be learned, I think,

01:31:06.350 --> 01:31:08.960
about looking back
at the time depth

01:31:08.960 --> 01:31:10.590
that archaeology
can offer, right?

01:31:10.590 --> 01:31:15.820
So, rather than being just
a Sunday afternoon pastime

01:31:15.820 --> 01:31:17.860
or something we could
do for fun,

01:31:17.860 --> 01:31:21.710
and archaeology certainly is
fun, it also has a more --

01:31:21.710 --> 01:31:25.080
much more serious role to play

01:31:25.080 --> 01:31:27.210
in understanding
geopolitics, right?

01:31:27.210 --> 01:31:31.050
And, in thinking about the
lessons that can be drawn

01:31:31.050 --> 01:31:35.770
about the underlying causes of
war and conflict, and the rise

01:31:35.770 --> 01:31:40.100
and fall of different
geopolitical actors in the past.

01:31:40.100 --> 01:31:44.500
So, that I think is
among the types of topics

01:31:44.500 --> 01:31:46.680
that really get archaeologists
excited to think

01:31:46.680 --> 01:31:52.160
about what lessons can we learn
about those sorts of patterns

01:31:52.160 --> 01:31:53.460
from the ancient past?

01:31:53.460 --> 01:31:59.570
And, there are indeed, you know,
many, many insights to be drawn.

01:31:59.570 --> 01:32:00.870
&gt;&gt; Moderator: Thank you.

01:32:00.870 --> 01:32:02.500
&gt;&gt; Dr. Krista Lewis: I could
just pick up really briefly

01:32:02.500 --> 01:32:05.420
on what Dr. Harrower was saying,
and just extend that point

01:32:05.420 --> 01:32:08.770
by saying, you know, while in
some respects you could say

01:32:08.770 --> 01:32:10.870
that Oman is not
unique in this, right?

01:32:10.870 --> 01:32:12.810
For some place to be
connected globally

01:32:12.810 --> 01:32:15.700
to all these other places it
means those other places have

01:32:15.700 --> 01:32:18.270
to be also in turn
connected globally.

01:32:18.270 --> 01:32:21.230
But, I think what we're seeing
with the increasing amounts

01:32:21.230 --> 01:32:24.400
of research that are
showing the local specificity

01:32:24.400 --> 01:32:27.050
of those patterns, and
who they're reaching,

01:32:27.050 --> 01:32:28.570
and who they're not reaching.

01:32:28.570 --> 01:32:30.270
Or, how maybe the effects

01:32:30.270 --> 01:32:33.470
of this global interconnection
are reaching even to groups

01:32:33.470 --> 01:32:36.400
that are far from
direct contact.

01:32:36.400 --> 01:32:39.490
In a way, what we're
doing is helping

01:32:39.490 --> 01:32:43.940
to decolonize our scholarship,
and think beyond the idea,

01:32:43.940 --> 01:32:47.330
that is rather old fashioned
now, that certain central areas

01:32:47.330 --> 01:32:50.040
of the world were
important, more powerful,

01:32:50.040 --> 01:32:52.210
and that other people
were peripheral,

01:32:52.210 --> 01:32:55.340
less civilized if you will.

01:32:55.340 --> 01:32:57.610
And, I think this kind of
more nuanced understanding

01:32:57.610 --> 01:33:01.730
of what was happening
everywhere, and the really sort

01:33:01.730 --> 01:33:05.800
of dynamic way that people
were engaging, or choosing now

01:33:05.800 --> 01:33:09.370
to engage with the people
around them helps us, you know,

01:33:09.370 --> 01:33:10.670
in this -- you know,

01:33:10.670 --> 01:33:12.430
just follows what my
colleagues were saying.

01:33:12.430 --> 01:33:16.670
Helps us understand also today's
patterns, and warns us not

01:33:16.670 --> 01:33:18.910
to look at certain regions
of the world and say,

01:33:18.910 --> 01:33:20.210
"You're not important.

01:33:20.210 --> 01:33:21.510
You're not connected.

01:33:21.510 --> 01:33:23.650
You're not in these
patterns," because it's --

01:33:23.650 --> 01:33:25.050
we're all interconnected,

01:33:25.050 --> 01:33:26.670
and understanding
how that's happened

01:33:26.670 --> 01:33:27.970
in the past I think is --

01:33:27.970 --> 01:33:32.340
definitely gives us
a view to the future.

01:33:32.340 --> 01:33:35.310
&gt;&gt; Joan Weeks: Welcome
to our third panel today

01:33:35.310 --> 01:33:40.030
about the modern cultural
tourism of ancient sites.

01:33:40.030 --> 01:33:42.080
What a wonderful concept.

01:33:42.080 --> 01:33:44.050
I hope by the end of this panel

01:33:44.050 --> 01:33:48.940
that we are all ready
to do exactly that.

01:33:48.940 --> 01:33:52.460
Take our own tourism
opportunities to visit some

01:33:52.460 --> 01:33:53.770
of these ancient sites.

01:33:53.770 --> 01:33:56.480
I know I'd love to do that,

01:33:56.480 --> 01:33:59.660
but it is a very
delicate balancing act

01:33:59.660 --> 01:34:03.040
between cultural
heritage, preservation

01:34:03.040 --> 01:34:06.990
of these fragile sites, and
the promotion of tourism.

01:34:06.990 --> 01:34:11.350
And, this is something that the
Omani government is dedicated

01:34:11.350 --> 01:34:12.900
to doing, and is trying

01:34:12.900 --> 01:34:16.220
to preserve this rich
cultural heritage,

01:34:16.220 --> 01:34:21.920
but also make these fantastic
sites available, because it is

01:34:21.920 --> 01:34:26.160
such a fantastic opportunity
and builds knowledge

01:34:26.160 --> 01:34:29.760
and appreciation of the
cultural heritage of Oman.

01:34:29.760 --> 01:34:32.130
So, I'm Joan Weeks, I'm head
of the Near East section here

01:34:32.130 --> 01:34:35.540
at the Library of Congress,
and it's my great pleasure

01:34:35.540 --> 01:34:39.610
to introduce this first
presentation on frameworks

01:34:39.610 --> 01:34:44.510
for preservation, tourism, and
relevance by Dr. Nathan Reigner.

01:34:44.510 --> 01:34:48.420
Nathan Reigner is a consulting
social scientist and principal

01:34:48.420 --> 01:34:52.300
of Recreation and
Tourism Science LLC.

01:34:52.300 --> 01:34:55.780
Dr. Reigner has collaborated
with federal and state parks

01:34:55.780 --> 01:34:59.180
and forest agencies
as well as NGOs

01:34:59.180 --> 01:35:01.710
in the United States and abroad.

01:35:01.710 --> 01:35:05.360
During his 12 years of parks
research, Dr. Reigner has worked

01:35:05.360 --> 01:35:09.080
in more than 50 units of
the national parks system.

01:35:09.080 --> 01:35:11.780
Additionally, he provides
technical assistance

01:35:11.780 --> 01:35:15.130
on visitor use management
to the nature reserve

01:35:15.130 --> 01:35:18.840
and natural park systems
of the Russian Federation,

01:35:18.840 --> 01:35:22.990
public and private outdoor
recreation areas in Iceland,

01:35:22.990 --> 01:35:25.700
and nature-based
tourism destinations

01:35:25.700 --> 01:35:28.290
in the Sultanate of Oman.

01:35:28.290 --> 01:35:32.660
Dr. Reigner is 2018s Sultan
Qaboos Cultural Center

01:35:32.660 --> 01:35:34.120
research fellow.

01:35:34.120 --> 01:35:37.700
He holds an MS in
forestry from Richmond --

01:35:37.700 --> 01:35:41.910
or, from Virginia Polytechnic
Institute and State University,

01:35:41.910 --> 01:35:46.600
and his PHD in natural resources
from the University of Vermont,

01:35:46.600 --> 01:35:48.670
Rubenstein School
of Environmental

01:35:48.670 --> 01:35:50.110
and Natural Resources.

01:35:50.110 --> 01:35:52.510
Please welcome Dr.
Reigner to the podium.

01:35:52.510 --> 01:35:58.730
[ Applause ]

01:35:58.730 --> 01:36:00.720
&gt;&gt; Dr. Nathan Reigner: Thank
you all for having me today.

01:36:00.720 --> 01:36:02.020
My name's Nathan Reigner.

01:36:02.020 --> 01:36:05.040
I'd like to thank her
excellency, the ambassador

01:36:05.040 --> 01:36:08.300
of the Sultan Qaboos Cultural
Center, the Library of Congress,

01:36:08.300 --> 01:36:11.020
for helping to make this
conference possible.

01:36:11.020 --> 01:36:12.420
I have learned a lot today.

01:36:12.420 --> 01:36:16.120
I hope to continue to learn
throughout the afternoon.

01:36:16.120 --> 01:36:20.710
And, I want to preface my
remarks with the statement

01:36:20.710 --> 01:36:23.220
that I have not yet
been to Oman.

01:36:23.220 --> 01:36:29.300
I am one of the SQCCs
research fellows for 2018.

01:36:29.300 --> 01:36:30.690
I'm very happy about that.

01:36:30.690 --> 01:36:32.710
I'm honored by that.

01:36:32.710 --> 01:36:35.490
My fellow fellow, Bess
Perry [assumed spelling],

01:36:35.490 --> 01:36:41.080
is very happy about that as
well, and, so what I hope to do

01:36:41.080 --> 01:36:44.550
with you today is share
some of the framework,

01:36:44.550 --> 01:36:48.790
some of the foundations
that we have used

01:36:48.790 --> 01:36:51.350
in the US national park
system, particularly

01:36:51.350 --> 01:36:54.980
in cultural heritage sites for
the US national park system,

01:36:54.980 --> 01:36:59.110
that inform our perspective,
and that we hope to take with us

01:36:59.110 --> 01:37:02.740
to Oman as we work on our
research fellowship in

01:37:02.740 --> 01:37:05.950
and around Al-Saleel
National Park.

01:37:05.950 --> 01:37:07.770
I could not have asked

01:37:07.770 --> 01:37:12.190
for a better introduction
to this remarks.

01:37:12.190 --> 01:37:14.500
Well, that was a very
lovely introduction.

01:37:14.500 --> 01:37:17.890
Thank you, but her excellency
this morning made a statement

01:37:17.890 --> 01:37:21.610
that was just perfect
for putting my interests

01:37:21.610 --> 01:37:25.520
and the remarks that I'll share
with you today into perspective.

01:37:25.520 --> 01:37:26.820
She said to us that, "We want

01:37:26.820 --> 01:37:29.390
to maintain these
treasures while sharing them

01:37:29.390 --> 01:37:30.690
with the world."

01:37:30.690 --> 01:37:33.620
And, that's the basic tension
that I see at the center

01:37:33.620 --> 01:37:37.960
of tourism to cultural sites,
and I hope that some of ideas

01:37:37.960 --> 01:37:41.340
that I share with
you today can help us

01:37:41.340 --> 01:37:43.510
to all advance that cause.

01:37:43.510 --> 01:37:46.040
So, protected areas --

01:37:46.040 --> 01:37:48.280
you're going to hear me use
the word protected area.

01:37:48.280 --> 01:37:50.940
You're going to hear
me use the word park.

01:37:50.940 --> 01:37:53.050
In this context, we're
talking about the types

01:37:53.050 --> 01:37:54.790
of archaeological and
cultural heritage sites

01:37:54.790 --> 01:37:56.390
that we've been discussing
today.

01:37:56.390 --> 01:37:57.760
They're mission oriented.

01:37:57.760 --> 01:38:00.260
Once these places are
designated by the government,

01:38:00.260 --> 01:38:02.590
they're dedicated to
preservation, they're dedicated

01:38:02.590 --> 01:38:05.950
to helping people learn about
culture, and they're dedicated

01:38:05.950 --> 01:38:10.080
to helping people enjoy and
celebrate their cultures.

01:38:10.080 --> 01:38:12.110
But, these places
are often also --

01:38:12.110 --> 01:38:15.680
are also often marked
by competing objectives,

01:38:15.680 --> 01:38:17.260
objectives for protection,

01:38:17.260 --> 01:38:20.070
objectives for economic
development,

01:38:20.070 --> 01:38:22.850
objectives for different
types of uses

01:38:22.850 --> 01:38:27.910
that create some tensions around
the management of these places

01:38:27.910 --> 01:38:29.370
that need to be addressed.

01:38:29.370 --> 01:38:33.430
So, as I mentioned our
research fellowship is going

01:38:33.430 --> 01:38:36.040
to be centered on
Al-Saleel National Park.

01:38:36.040 --> 01:38:37.410
I have the location.

01:38:37.410 --> 01:38:42.560
Al-Saleel is a gazelle
breeding facility.

01:38:42.560 --> 01:38:45.520
It is -- my understanding is

01:38:45.520 --> 01:38:47.970
that it is relatively
newly designated,

01:38:47.970 --> 01:38:52.620
and right now management
approaches are being developed

01:38:52.620 --> 01:38:55.710
and created for this place.

01:38:55.710 --> 01:38:58.780
Al-Saleel National
Park lies along many

01:38:58.780 --> 01:39:01.540
of the most popular
routes tourists take

01:39:01.540 --> 01:39:03.380
when they're in Oman.

01:39:03.380 --> 01:39:07.870
We can see it in these -- in
each of these maps, Google maps,

01:39:07.870 --> 01:39:10.830
that people have posted
about their tourism routes,

01:39:10.830 --> 01:39:16.150
Al-Saleel National Park is
located on each of these.

01:39:16.150 --> 01:39:21.210
Right now it's a relatively
small facility without a lot

01:39:21.210 --> 01:39:26.100
of developed infrastructure
for visitors or tourists to use

01:39:26.100 --> 01:39:28.030
or to support their stays.

01:39:28.030 --> 01:39:35.360
And, so we hope to use
our research fellowship

01:39:35.360 --> 01:39:41.580
to make some recommendations
on how Al-Saleel can develop

01:39:41.580 --> 01:39:44.220
in a way that supports
the tourism economy,

01:39:44.220 --> 01:39:46.710
that protects the culture, that
protects the natural heritage

01:39:46.710 --> 01:39:50.340
of the place, and
that engages in --

01:39:50.340 --> 01:39:54.080
engages local communities
in that process.

01:39:54.080 --> 01:39:55.620
There are a few basic
foundations

01:39:55.620 --> 01:39:56.920
that we're going
to bring to this.

01:39:56.920 --> 01:39:58.690
One is the concept of relevance.

01:39:58.690 --> 01:40:00.700
Another is the concept
of objective based --

01:40:00.700 --> 01:40:03.270
what is called objective
based adaptive management,

01:40:03.270 --> 01:40:05.800
and I'll talk to you a
little bit about that.

01:40:05.800 --> 01:40:10.270
Objective based adaptive
management can help us know what

01:40:10.270 --> 01:40:12.260
needs to be done to
protect these sites

01:40:12.260 --> 01:40:14.580
and to facilitate their use.

01:40:14.580 --> 01:40:17.430
And, then while we're working on
this we want to do it in a way

01:40:17.430 --> 01:40:19.740
that cultivates a
diversity of experiences

01:40:19.740 --> 01:40:23.820
and reflects the general
democratic purposes

01:40:23.820 --> 01:40:25.120
of these places.

01:40:25.120 --> 01:40:27.340
So, those are the concept
we'll go over, but let's talk

01:40:27.340 --> 01:40:29.530
about relevance first.

01:40:29.530 --> 01:40:33.240
When I talk about relevance
in terms of protected areas,

01:40:33.240 --> 01:40:36.350
particularly cultural
heritage spaces,

01:40:36.350 --> 01:40:41.110
I'm talking about
having deep and broad

01:40:41.110 --> 01:40:48.260
and lasting connections between
protected areas, park sites,

01:40:48.260 --> 01:40:52.400
or heritage sites
and their managers,

01:40:52.400 --> 01:40:58.040
visitors to these places, and
the communities that live in

01:40:58.040 --> 01:41:01.280
and around these places.

01:41:01.280 --> 01:41:06.060
These connections are the
product of shared goals

01:41:06.060 --> 01:41:07.450
when done correctly,

01:41:07.450 --> 01:41:11.330
but building these connections
can often highlight some

01:41:11.330 --> 01:41:13.780
of the tensions or
competing objectives

01:41:13.780 --> 01:41:17.280
that we talked about earlier.

01:41:17.280 --> 01:41:21.030
Sometimes relevance is an
easy thing to accomplish.

01:41:21.030 --> 01:41:23.910
Jazz National Historical
Park is a historical site

01:41:23.910 --> 01:41:25.410
in New Orleans, Virginia,

01:41:25.410 --> 01:41:28.360
dedicated to celebrating
the idea of jazz,

01:41:28.360 --> 01:41:30.110
a uniquely American art form.

01:41:30.110 --> 01:41:34.830
It's easy for Jazz National
Historical site to be relevant.

01:41:34.830 --> 01:41:36.820
Who here listens to jazz?

01:41:36.820 --> 01:41:40.290
Every hand should be up.

01:41:40.290 --> 01:41:42.700
We feel it as part of our lives.

01:41:42.700 --> 01:41:45.080
It's still very much
part of the community

01:41:45.080 --> 01:41:48.600
in which Jazz National
Historical site is located.

01:41:48.600 --> 01:41:51.570
My -- where's my
Arkansas friend?

01:41:51.570 --> 01:41:53.520
Hot Springs National Park

01:41:53.520 --> 01:41:55.580
in Arkansas is having
a little bit more

01:41:55.580 --> 01:41:57.520
of a challenge with relevancy.

01:41:57.520 --> 01:42:00.810
Hot Springs National Park
preserves some natural features,

01:42:00.810 --> 01:42:05.560
but it also preserves a set
of spa or health, sort of,

01:42:05.560 --> 01:42:09.170
medical baths that were
really part of the hay day

01:42:09.170 --> 01:42:11.150
of Hot Springs 100 years ago.

01:42:11.150 --> 01:42:14.390
And, we don't exactly
practice health the way we used

01:42:14.390 --> 01:42:16.820
to practice health
100 years ago.

01:42:16.820 --> 01:42:21.170
And, so connecting
relevantly between the park

01:42:21.170 --> 01:42:23.050
and the population
in Hot Springs,

01:42:23.050 --> 01:42:26.030
Arkansas, is a challenge.

01:42:26.030 --> 01:42:29.830
Gates of the Arctic National
Park up in Alaska has a --

01:42:29.830 --> 01:42:34.050
faces relevance challenges,
but for different reasons.

01:42:34.050 --> 01:42:38.710
It house resources like
bears and caribou, salmon,

01:42:38.710 --> 01:42:44.040
and indigenous communities and
their subsistence practices

01:42:44.040 --> 01:42:48.800
that we all value, however
virtually nobody goes there,

01:42:48.800 --> 01:42:50.980
and it's impossible to get to.

01:42:50.980 --> 01:42:54.980
And, so how do you keep a place
that is very physically distant

01:42:54.980 --> 01:42:57.580
from a population relevant?

01:42:57.580 --> 01:43:00.230
These are some of
the challenges.

01:43:00.230 --> 01:43:04.260
We hope to explore relevance
and provide some guidance

01:43:04.260 --> 01:43:08.050
to enhance the relevance
of Al-Saleel National Park

01:43:08.050 --> 01:43:09.540
with a multi-phase, sort of,

01:43:09.540 --> 01:43:11.920
multiple methods
research project,

01:43:11.920 --> 01:43:16.100
where we will be interviewing
communities, stake holders

01:43:16.100 --> 01:43:20.000
around Al-Saleel National Park,
as well as leaders in Muscat.

01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:22.340
We'll be asking these
individuals to participate

01:43:22.340 --> 01:43:23.860
in structured interviews

01:43:23.860 --> 01:43:27.630
from which we'll be
gleaning social network data

01:43:27.630 --> 01:43:30.800
about both connections
that could make

01:43:30.800 --> 01:43:33.940
for strong partnerships,
and obstacles that need

01:43:33.940 --> 01:43:37.140
to be overcome for
partnerships to develop.

01:43:37.140 --> 01:43:40.750
And, we'll be doing that using
spatially explicit methods

01:43:40.750 --> 01:43:47.100
with participatory GIS, mapping
these connections on the ground.

01:43:47.100 --> 01:43:53.110
Bess, my fellow fellow, is
-- she is the relevant one.

01:43:53.110 --> 01:43:54.840
She knows this much
more than I do,

01:43:54.840 --> 01:43:57.630
but as far as I'm concerned
the important part of this is

01:43:57.630 --> 01:43:59.920
that this is a process.

01:43:59.920 --> 01:44:04.080
It's about determining what
our goals are, finding ways

01:44:04.080 --> 01:44:07.540
for our goals to align, and
then moving forward based

01:44:07.540 --> 01:44:10.470
on those common objectives.

01:44:10.470 --> 01:44:13.340
Once we have those common
objectives established we can

01:44:13.340 --> 01:44:17.710
move into an objectives-based
management framework.

01:44:17.710 --> 01:44:22.600
So, I often work in
wilderness settings, wildlands,

01:44:22.600 --> 01:44:25.020
mountain national
parks where, like,

01:44:25.020 --> 01:44:27.140
solitude is one of
the objectives.

01:44:27.140 --> 01:44:30.510
We want people to go out and
have solitude in the wilderness,

01:44:30.510 --> 01:44:33.430
which is great, but
how does a manager

01:44:33.430 --> 01:44:35.140
of a site manage for solitude?

01:44:35.140 --> 01:44:36.490
How do they measure solitude?

01:44:36.490 --> 01:44:39.450
Can they count -- well,
there's one solitude over here

01:44:39.450 --> 01:44:41.460
and three solitudes
over there, and,

01:44:41.460 --> 01:44:43.300
so we must be doing a
better job over here.

01:44:43.300 --> 01:44:45.710
It's very difficult.

01:44:45.710 --> 01:44:49.460
So, once we have these
goals or objectives defined

01:44:49.460 --> 01:44:53.100
in conceptual, broad,
narrative terms we need

01:44:53.100 --> 01:44:55.740
to find quantifiable,
measurable,

01:44:55.740 --> 01:44:59.840
manageable variables, proxy
variables, that we can use

01:44:59.840 --> 01:45:01.260
to measure these objectives.

01:45:01.260 --> 01:45:03.350
And, then we have
to set the threshold

01:45:03.350 --> 01:45:07.210
that help us evaluate whether we
are accomplishing our management

01:45:07.210 --> 01:45:08.950
goals or not.

01:45:08.950 --> 01:45:12.670
And, I have a little story here
about how we went about doing

01:45:12.670 --> 01:45:17.160
that at Castillo de San Marcos,
which is a historical park

01:45:17.160 --> 01:45:18.460
at St. Augustine, Florida,

01:45:18.460 --> 01:45:21.850
the first masonry
structure still existent --

01:45:21.850 --> 01:45:24.890
the oldest masonry structure
still existent in North America.

01:45:24.890 --> 01:45:26.190
Something like that.

01:45:26.190 --> 01:45:29.670
Not mason -- right, because
there are the pyramids

01:45:29.670 --> 01:45:31.030
in meso-America,
things like that.

01:45:31.030 --> 01:45:33.180
It has a first for some reason,

01:45:33.180 --> 01:45:34.880
and we're very proud
of it for that.

01:45:34.880 --> 01:45:36.180
It is a star fort.

01:45:36.180 --> 01:45:38.590
It was built for the Spanish.

01:45:38.590 --> 01:45:42.460
It is a beautiful
place to visit.

01:45:42.460 --> 01:45:47.390
It is designated to preserve the
architectural characteristics,

01:45:47.390 --> 01:45:51.950
and to interpret the
history of colonial Florida,

01:45:51.950 --> 01:45:55.970
both the Spanish and English
histories as well as the history

01:45:55.970 --> 01:45:58.440
of the Native Americans
who lived in Florida

01:45:58.440 --> 01:46:00.040
and interacted with the fort.

01:46:00.040 --> 01:46:05.450
One of the key ways that
the National Park Service

01:46:05.450 --> 01:46:08.490
and Castillo de San Marcos
accomplished this mission is

01:46:08.490 --> 01:46:12.240
through education, through
engagement of people.

01:46:12.240 --> 01:46:13.590
There are displays.

01:46:13.590 --> 01:46:17.460
There are reenactments,
and visitors

01:46:17.460 --> 01:46:23.360
to this site learn quite a
lot, except when it's crowded.

01:46:23.360 --> 01:46:24.700
When there are too
many people coming

01:46:24.700 --> 01:46:27.900
to the site it's virtually
impossible to engage

01:46:27.900 --> 01:46:29.720
with the education material.

01:46:29.720 --> 01:46:32.590
This site is visited by a lot

01:46:32.590 --> 01:46:34.230
of school groups,
which is wonderful.

01:46:34.230 --> 01:46:37.880
Those school groups
can learn a lot,

01:46:37.880 --> 01:46:40.440
but also those large
groups moving

01:46:40.440 --> 01:46:46.480
through in an organized manner
can inhibit citizen visitors,

01:46:46.480 --> 01:46:50.770
individual visitors, from
learning and engaging.

01:46:50.770 --> 01:46:53.020
And, all of this
is a big challenge

01:46:53.020 --> 01:46:58.140
for Castillo de San Marcos
to accomplish its goal.

01:46:58.140 --> 01:47:02.830
So, if their objective is for
people to be able to engage

01:47:02.830 --> 01:47:06.230
with the interpretive
information and learn about

01:47:06.230 --> 01:47:09.350
and appreciate the history
of Castillo de San Marcos

01:47:09.350 --> 01:47:12.550
and its role in the modern
world, we need measurable,

01:47:12.550 --> 01:47:14.890
manageable variables

01:47:14.890 --> 01:47:17.750
to see whether we're
accomplishing our objective.

01:47:17.750 --> 01:47:20.720
Well, one of the variables
that we hit on was the number

01:47:20.720 --> 01:47:25.820
of people in any given area
of the fort at one time.

01:47:25.820 --> 01:47:29.110
That variable is hard to
collect, but what is easy

01:47:29.110 --> 01:47:33.240
to do is to count the number
of people entering this fort.

01:47:33.240 --> 01:47:34.650
There's a door counter.

01:47:34.650 --> 01:47:38.090
It takes a click for
every person who enters.

01:47:38.090 --> 01:47:40.570
We can correlate statistically

01:47:40.570 --> 01:47:42.730
after collecting
some field data here,

01:47:42.730 --> 01:47:44.890
some of our great field
assistants collecting some field

01:47:44.890 --> 01:47:48.310
data, we can correlate
the number of entrees

01:47:48.310 --> 01:47:51.220
into Castillo de San
Marcos, the relationship

01:47:51.220 --> 01:47:55.530
that those entries have to
the number of people standing

01:47:55.530 --> 01:47:57.650
in front of the signs
at any one time.

01:47:57.650 --> 01:48:03.820
And, we can say, "Okay, we
want at least 50 percent

01:48:03.820 --> 01:48:07.260
of the people to be
able to read the signs,

01:48:07.260 --> 01:48:12.130
so we need to keep our numbers
less than 50 on the Y axis here.

01:48:12.130 --> 01:48:14.780
That means that we can
have about 150 people

01:48:14.780 --> 01:48:18.600
at any one time entering
this site if we want

01:48:18.600 --> 01:48:20.030
to accomplish our
management goal

01:48:20.030 --> 01:48:23.190
of people being able
to read the signs."

01:48:23.190 --> 01:48:26.630
So, we were able to
take that information,

01:48:26.630 --> 01:48:29.300
plot it against the
overall use of this site,

01:48:29.300 --> 01:48:34.440
figure out the days and times
in which this site is sort

01:48:34.440 --> 01:48:38.220
of overused in terms
of being able to engage

01:48:38.220 --> 01:48:40.870
with the interpretive material
and provide some guidance

01:48:40.870 --> 01:48:45.060
to national park
service about what to do

01:48:45.060 --> 01:48:46.850
to address this situation.

01:48:46.850 --> 01:48:49.750
So, that's our -- so we have --

01:48:49.750 --> 01:48:53.430
relevance is based upon
shared objectives and goals.

01:48:53.430 --> 01:48:57.100
We have our identified goal,
in this case of being able

01:48:57.100 --> 01:48:59.470
to engage with the
interpretive information.

01:48:59.470 --> 01:49:00.820
We're able to measure that --

01:49:00.820 --> 01:49:02.910
our progress of that
against that goal

01:49:02.910 --> 01:49:05.440
and determine whether
we're achieving it or not

01:49:05.440 --> 01:49:07.420
without indicators
and thresholds.

01:49:07.420 --> 01:49:09.800
But, then what do we
do about it, right?

01:49:09.800 --> 01:49:11.500
We found out we're
either successful,

01:49:11.500 --> 01:49:14.500
or if we're failing we should
do something about this.

01:49:14.500 --> 01:49:17.350
We need to take some
management action.

01:49:17.350 --> 01:49:20.950
Well, most often the management
action that I see in places

01:49:20.950 --> 01:49:24.380
like this is, well, we need to
decrease the demand being placed

01:49:24.380 --> 01:49:28.580
on these places, and we do that
by limiting the amount of use.

01:49:28.580 --> 01:49:33.650
It is potentially affective,
but in some ways it sabotages us

01:49:33.650 --> 01:49:35.600
in trying to accomplish
our goal.

01:49:35.600 --> 01:49:37.980
If our goal is to get people
to engage, if our goal is

01:49:37.980 --> 01:49:42.500
to share them with the world,
limiting the number of people

01:49:42.500 --> 01:49:45.160
who can come into these
places is not going

01:49:45.160 --> 01:49:47.510
to help us achieve that.

01:49:47.510 --> 01:49:49.070
So, I want to highlight
that there are a number

01:49:49.070 --> 01:49:51.590
of other strategies and tactics
or strategies and actions

01:49:51.590 --> 01:49:57.510
that can be taken to
address these situations.

01:49:57.510 --> 01:49:59.010
We don't need to just
decrease the demand.

01:49:59.010 --> 01:50:01.160
We can increase the
supply at these places.

01:50:01.160 --> 01:50:04.900
At Castillo de San Marcos
instead of decreasing the demand

01:50:04.900 --> 01:50:06.870
for reading signs, what
if we increase the number

01:50:06.870 --> 01:50:08.740
of signs that there were?

01:50:08.740 --> 01:50:11.600
Or, increase the number of
programs, or put up some lights

01:50:11.600 --> 01:50:14.670
and let people in at night and
expanded the amount of time

01:50:14.670 --> 01:50:17.140
that people could visit?

01:50:17.140 --> 01:50:21.820
We can harden the resources to
be more resistant to damages.

01:50:21.820 --> 01:50:26.750
We can adapt visitor
behavior to be less impactful,

01:50:26.750 --> 01:50:28.660
and we can do this with
any number of actions,

01:50:28.660 --> 01:50:32.630
and I have an example here
from Mesa Verde National Park

01:50:32.630 --> 01:50:34.430
about how this happened there.

01:50:34.430 --> 01:50:40.800
So, Mesa Verde, a Puebloan
settlement, now protected,

01:50:40.800 --> 01:50:43.480
one of the first national
parks established,

01:50:43.480 --> 01:50:46.760
one of the first national parks
national monuments established

01:50:46.760 --> 01:50:50.790
with the Antiquities Act,
preserved cliff dwellings

01:50:50.790 --> 01:50:56.350
and other archaeological
sites as well as petroglyphs.

01:50:56.350 --> 01:50:58.660
And, this place is
facing some problems.

01:50:58.660 --> 01:51:00.620
It's facing problems
with its historic

01:51:00.620 --> 01:51:02.900
and cultural resources
associated

01:51:02.900 --> 01:51:09.520
with inappropriate
use, graffiti, theft,

01:51:09.520 --> 01:51:14.210
and some of this use is
starting to affect the integrity

01:51:14.210 --> 01:51:18.390
of the sites themselves.

01:51:18.390 --> 01:51:21.430
And, so Parks Service here
has established a set of rules

01:51:21.430 --> 01:51:24.730
and regulations, and
they enforce them

01:51:24.730 --> 01:51:28.620
with active law enforcement,
and the way they do this is

01:51:28.620 --> 01:51:32.340
by requiring all
visitors to enter the site

01:51:32.340 --> 01:51:35.290
with a National Park
Service guide.

01:51:35.290 --> 01:51:38.990
So, we have a rule that says
that visitors are welcome

01:51:38.990 --> 01:51:43.030
to the site, but only under the
guidance of a trained ranger,

01:51:43.030 --> 01:51:46.370
and if you don't follow
this rule you are punishable

01:51:46.370 --> 01:51:47.720
under the law.

01:51:47.720 --> 01:51:54.060
And, this law enforcement
and rule

01:51:54.060 --> 01:51:57.790
and regulation has been coupled

01:51:57.790 --> 01:52:00.280
with a rationing
allocation scheme,

01:52:00.280 --> 01:52:04.080
the size of the tour groups
that can go in is calibrated not

01:52:04.080 --> 01:52:08.920
to exceed the maximum allowable,
and by education programs

01:52:08.920 --> 01:52:13.190
that help educate people why
these rules are necessary,

01:52:13.190 --> 01:52:16.250
which helps to gain
compliance with them.

01:52:16.250 --> 01:52:20.430
And, this is all
within a zoning regime,

01:52:20.430 --> 01:52:23.270
so that only the
most sensitive sites

01:52:23.270 --> 01:52:28.640
within the park require this
guided tour, while other,

01:52:28.640 --> 01:52:32.740
less sensitive areas of the
park are open without that guide

01:52:32.740 --> 01:52:36.120
to provide a diversity
of opportunities.

01:52:36.120 --> 01:52:37.420
And, so this diversity

01:52:37.420 --> 01:52:39.550
of opportunities is the
fourth foundational framework

01:52:39.550 --> 01:52:42.350
that we'll be bringing with
us to our work with Al-Saleel,

01:52:42.350 --> 01:52:45.310
the idea of opportunity spectra.

01:52:45.310 --> 01:52:49.720
That protected areas exist along
a range, many ranges in fact,

01:52:49.720 --> 01:52:53.570
from urban to wild, from
developed to primitive,

01:52:53.570 --> 01:52:56.800
from high use to ow use,
from highly regulated

01:52:56.800 --> 01:52:59.970
to less highly regulated, from
closer to cities to further away

01:52:59.970 --> 01:53:01.830
from cities, all kinds
of different spectra.

01:53:01.830 --> 01:53:04.170
And, I think if we're
doing a good job

01:53:04.170 --> 01:53:07.140
at managing our cultural
heritage sites then we have a

01:53:07.140 --> 01:53:08.970
diversity of different
types of sites.

01:53:08.970 --> 01:53:11.480
And, the San Antonio Missions
National Historical Park,

01:53:11.480 --> 01:53:13.740
also a world heritage
site in Texas,

01:53:13.740 --> 01:53:16.760
I think does a good job
of illustrating that.

01:53:16.760 --> 01:53:18.200
This is a chain of
missions that runs

01:53:18.200 --> 01:53:20.660
down the San Antonio
River south of the city,

01:53:20.660 --> 01:53:22.890
and there are many different
missions along the way.

01:53:22.890 --> 01:53:24.680
There are primitive,
small missions

01:53:24.680 --> 01:53:26.550
that have not been restored.

01:53:26.550 --> 01:53:29.700
There are larger missions
that have been restored.

01:53:29.700 --> 01:53:32.230
There are recreational
opportunities

01:53:32.230 --> 01:53:33.810
that link these missions.

01:53:33.810 --> 01:53:37.000
There are sacred services
that are still conducted

01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:39.660
within these missions
that are in line

01:53:39.660 --> 01:53:41.560
with their original
establishment,

01:53:41.560 --> 01:53:45.820
and these missions as a whole
park are managed not just

01:53:45.820 --> 01:53:49.250
for historical preservation, but
also for wildlife preservation

01:53:49.250 --> 01:53:53.860
and ecological quality
along the San Antonio River.

01:53:53.860 --> 01:53:57.040
So, I think the San Antonio
River has done a good job

01:53:57.040 --> 01:53:59.930
of providing a diversity

01:53:59.930 --> 01:54:02.960
of opportunities
along this corridor.

01:54:02.960 --> 01:54:05.710
And, one of the key things the
we were interested in doing

01:54:05.710 --> 01:54:08.550
with Al-Saleel National
Park is helping it fit

01:54:08.550 --> 01:54:14.240
within the diversity of
tourism opportunities in Oman.

01:54:14.240 --> 01:54:19.350
Oman has a diversity of
cultural heritage sites

01:54:19.350 --> 01:54:20.860
that we've heard about today.

01:54:20.860 --> 01:54:23.240
It has a diversity of
natural heritage sites,

01:54:23.240 --> 01:54:25.580
it has a diversity of
other opportunities

01:54:25.580 --> 01:54:28.030
that will draw tourists
to the country

01:54:28.030 --> 01:54:32.350
and help the world realize
what a wonderful place Oman is.

01:54:32.350 --> 01:54:36.680
And, so we look forward to
bringing these foundations

01:54:36.680 --> 01:54:41.700
of relevance of the objectives
and indicators based approach

01:54:41.700 --> 01:54:47.240
and the opportunities spectra
concept to Oman in our research.

01:54:47.240 --> 01:54:48.540
And, I look forward --

01:54:48.540 --> 01:54:51.050
one of the things I look forward
here today, both with the rest

01:54:51.050 --> 01:54:54.550
of the panel and in the
discussion afterwards,

01:54:54.550 --> 01:54:59.260
is hearing about your ideas
about how we can apply these

01:54:59.260 --> 01:55:02.190
and other concepts to our work
in Al Saleel when we're there.

01:55:02.190 --> 01:55:03.990
Thank you very much
for your time.

01:55:03.990 --> 01:55:10.500
[ Applause ]

01:55:14.040 --> 01:55:17.970
&gt;&gt; Joan Weeks: Thank you so
much, Dr. Nathan Reigner.

01:55:17.970 --> 01:55:19.390
That was fascinating.

01:55:19.390 --> 01:55:21.590
I think we see a
pathway forward,

01:55:21.590 --> 01:55:26.780
and this is really going
to be a great opportunity

01:55:26.780 --> 01:55:30.030
for developing tourism in Oman.

01:55:30.030 --> 01:55:35.380
And, to continue on with this
theme I really love this one.

01:55:35.380 --> 01:55:40.890
Traveling the sands of time, a
foray into cultural heritage.

01:55:40.890 --> 01:55:46.630
Tourism in the Sultanate of Oman
by Dr. Christopher Thornton.

01:55:46.630 --> 01:55:48.860
Christopher Thornton
is the senior director

01:55:48.860 --> 01:55:52.310
of cultural heritage of the
National Geographic Society

01:55:52.310 --> 01:55:56.770
where he oversees grants
and programs in archeology,

01:55:56.770 --> 01:56:02.200
anthropology, paleoanthropology,
and human geography.

01:56:02.200 --> 01:56:06.240
After lecturing at
George Mason University,

01:56:06.240 --> 01:56:10.460
Dr. Thornton joined the
National Geographic in 2010

01:56:10.460 --> 01:56:13.530
to oversee the research
grants program.

01:56:13.530 --> 01:56:14.940
In addition to his role

01:56:14.940 --> 01:56:17.600
in advising the National
Geographic Society

01:56:17.600 --> 01:56:20.640
and National Geographic
Media on issues related

01:56:20.640 --> 01:56:23.660
to cultural heritage,
Dr. Thornton sits

01:56:23.660 --> 01:56:27.160
on the US Commission to
UNESCO and is director

01:56:27.160 --> 01:56:32.200
of the UNESCO world
heritage site of Bat in Oman.

01:56:32.200 --> 01:56:35.410
He's an expert in the
origins of metallurgy

01:56:35.410 --> 01:56:40.310
and early complex
societies in Iran and Arabia.

01:56:40.310 --> 01:56:43.330
Dr. Thornton holds a
PHD in anthropology

01:56:43.330 --> 01:56:45.870
from the University
of Pennsylvania.

01:56:45.870 --> 01:56:48.510
Please welcome him
to the podium.

01:56:48.510 --> 01:56:54.910
[ Applause ]

01:56:54.910 --> 01:56:56.210
&gt;&gt; Dr. Christopher
Thornton: Thank you.

01:56:56.210 --> 01:56:58.380
I should shorten that
bio a little bit I think.

01:56:58.380 --> 01:57:00.740
Let me start by saying thank
you to the Library of Congress

01:57:00.740 --> 01:57:03.000
and the Sultan Qaboos
Cultural Center

01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:04.960
for this wonderful opportunity.

01:57:04.960 --> 01:57:07.210
I was -- in the coffee
break I was talking to some

01:57:07.210 --> 01:57:10.420
of my colleagues, and I'm pretty
confident this is the very first

01:57:10.420 --> 01:57:12.380
time in history that all

01:57:12.380 --> 01:57:16.060
of the American archeology
teams working in Oman have been

01:57:16.060 --> 01:57:19.460
in the same place talking
about their projects.

01:57:19.460 --> 01:57:21.320
And, I'd like to
throw it out there

01:57:21.320 --> 01:57:24.770
that this has actually been
an amazing opportunity for us

01:57:24.770 --> 01:57:26.560
to hear what each
other is doing,

01:57:26.560 --> 01:57:28.770
and America is actually
growing force

01:57:28.770 --> 01:57:31.020
in cultural heritage in Oman.

01:57:31.020 --> 01:57:34.590
When Joy and Dr. Cable
and I first started

01:57:34.590 --> 01:57:37.930
in Oman there were only three
projects run by Americans,

01:57:37.930 --> 01:57:40.550
and it was heavily dominated
by the French and the Italians,

01:57:40.550 --> 01:57:42.250
and the Germans, sorry,
Olivie [assumed spelling].

01:57:42.250 --> 01:57:45.800
And, nowadays, I would say
that American teams are some

01:57:45.800 --> 01:57:49.330
of the strongest and the largest
teams in Oman and are a major,

01:57:49.330 --> 01:57:53.450
major training grounds for
students to learn archeology

01:57:53.450 --> 01:57:54.900
but also to learn
about the Middle East,

01:57:54.900 --> 01:57:57.070
not just from America
but students from all

01:57:57.070 --> 01:57:59.890
over the world come to
work on American projects.

01:57:59.890 --> 01:58:03.970
So, I throw to you Sultan
Qaboos Cultural Center to think

01:58:03.970 --> 01:58:06.590
about how we can maybe
continue this dialogue

01:58:06.590 --> 01:58:11.110
and working together
to kind of fuse this.

01:58:11.110 --> 01:58:14.620
So with that I will follow
Dr. Reigner by saying

01:58:14.620 --> 01:58:16.190
that I'm not an expert
in tourism.

01:58:16.190 --> 01:58:20.740
I'm an archeologist but unlike
Dr. Reigner I have been to Oman,

01:58:20.740 --> 01:58:26.150
and I was very lucky to
for two years be involved

01:58:26.150 --> 01:58:28.500
in a tourism effort in Oman,

01:58:28.500 --> 01:58:30.650
bringing mainly American
tourists.

01:58:30.650 --> 01:58:33.400
So, instead of talking
about the Bat project

01:58:33.400 --> 01:58:35.040
which I'm happy to
do afterwards.

01:58:35.040 --> 01:58:36.940
Dr. Cable and Dr. Soritas
[assumed spelling] my

01:58:36.940 --> 01:58:39.750
co-directors are also
here, so we can tag team

01:58:39.750 --> 01:58:42.690
if people have questions
about the Bat project.

01:58:42.690 --> 01:58:45.790
I thought I would just
talk about this example

01:58:45.790 --> 01:58:48.590
that we ran a project for two
years that had some success

01:58:48.590 --> 01:58:51.370
and some failures,
but we learned a lot

01:58:51.370 --> 01:58:54.980
about what it takes to run
a cultural heritage tourism

01:58:54.980 --> 01:58:58.730
program in the Sultanate of
Oman, and I wanted to kind

01:58:58.730 --> 01:59:01.090
of share that with
all of you today.

01:59:01.090 --> 01:59:03.080
So, any of you who've
been to Muscat know

01:59:03.080 --> 01:59:05.360
that this is what a
tourist looks like, right?

01:59:05.360 --> 01:59:08.330
So, they're mainly
European tourists who come

01:59:08.330 --> 01:59:13.020
in off the cruise ships, and
they come into Muttrah and they,

01:59:13.020 --> 01:59:14.670
you know, pour off
the cruise ships

01:59:14.670 --> 01:59:17.830
and they ransack all the
Indian and Chinese goods

01:59:17.830 --> 01:59:21.260
in the Muttrah Souq, and then
they get back on the ships.

01:59:21.260 --> 01:59:23.460
And, all the Pakistanis,
and Bangladeshis,

01:59:23.460 --> 01:59:26.790
and the Belujis [phonetic] are,
like, you know, swirling around,

01:59:26.790 --> 01:59:29.190
and that's it, and
that's tourism, right?

01:59:29.190 --> 01:59:32.940
And, it has almost zero
benefits for the country.

01:59:32.940 --> 01:59:35.880
These people say,
"I've been to Oman."

01:59:35.880 --> 01:59:38.660
Great, check, right?

01:59:38.660 --> 01:59:41.090
Occasionally, the slightly
better tourists are the ones

01:59:41.090 --> 01:59:43.820
that come for this,
and they come and stay

01:59:43.820 --> 01:59:47.200
at these luxurious resorts,
traditionally in Muscat,

01:59:47.200 --> 01:59:48.920
you know, the Shetty
and the Shangri-La

01:59:48.920 --> 01:59:50.810
and all these wonderful
places I can't afford,

01:59:50.810 --> 01:59:54.240
and nowadays actually
Salalah, if any of you've been,

01:59:54.240 --> 01:59:55.850
there's some wonderful
resorts down at Salalah.

01:59:55.850 --> 01:59:57.420
So, all of this is for the good.

01:59:57.420 --> 01:59:59.740
It brings them there for longer,

01:59:59.740 --> 02:00:02.470
and occasionally
they leave the beach,

02:00:02.470 --> 02:00:04.600
and they do little
day trips, right?

02:00:04.600 --> 02:00:08.610
So, they hire a tourism company
through the hotel to drive them

02:00:08.610 --> 02:00:12.720
out to Nizwa Fort, and they
walk through Nizwa Fort

02:00:12.720 --> 02:00:16.050
with no guide, and they
saw, "Wow, that was neat.

02:00:16.050 --> 02:00:17.640
Let's go back to the beach."

02:00:17.640 --> 02:00:21.810
Right? That's tourism in Oman
right now, the vast majority

02:00:21.810 --> 02:00:24.440
of tourism, and I think
everybody here knows

02:00:24.440 --> 02:00:25.740
that doesn't work, right?

02:00:25.740 --> 02:00:27.280
So, this is the challenges
facing you,

02:00:27.280 --> 02:00:28.970
Dr. Reigner, welcome.

02:00:28.970 --> 02:00:33.630
And, so it was a
funny coincidence

02:00:33.630 --> 02:00:40.500
that just a few years ago I
collided with two now-friends,

02:00:40.500 --> 02:00:42.290
one of them Dr. Jeffrey Rose.

02:00:42.290 --> 02:00:43.590
He's known to many of you.

02:00:43.590 --> 02:00:45.050
He's an archeologist,
American who,

02:00:45.050 --> 02:00:48.090
he and his wife have now
been based in Oman for many,

02:00:48.090 --> 02:00:50.630
many years, and he runs
a project in Dhofar.

02:00:50.630 --> 02:00:54.170
He became a National
Geographic Explorer the year

02:00:54.170 --> 02:00:58.660
after a Palestinian became an
explorer who's a specialist

02:00:58.660 --> 02:01:02.020
in conflict resolution
and tourism,

02:01:02.020 --> 02:01:05.660
that is how do you use
tourism to bring interfaith

02:01:05.660 --> 02:01:07.810
and intercultural dialogue?

02:01:07.810 --> 02:01:09.540
So, the three of us
were probably staying

02:01:09.540 --> 02:01:11.980
up far too late,
and we were talking

02:01:11.980 --> 02:01:16.410
about what potential there
was in Oman for the kinds

02:01:16.410 --> 02:01:20.160
of projects that Aziz Abu Sarah
had been running for many years

02:01:20.160 --> 02:01:23.070
in the holy land
very successfully.

02:01:23.070 --> 02:01:26.730
So, I pointed out
that the funny thing

02:01:26.730 --> 02:01:30.350
about Oman is it has a chain
of UNESCO world heritage sites

02:01:30.350 --> 02:01:34.560
and potential sites like
Salut and other, Qalhat,

02:01:34.560 --> 02:01:36.860
all in the Northern
part of Oman,

02:01:36.860 --> 02:01:39.080
and there's that beautiful
Sultan Qaboos Highway

02:01:39.080 --> 02:01:41.650
that runs all the way
across to the Emirates.

02:01:41.650 --> 02:01:44.490
So, it's actually very
easy to access these sites

02:01:44.490 --> 02:01:46.290
if you know what
you're looking for,

02:01:46.290 --> 02:01:49.130
and it would be a very
easy overland expedition.

02:01:49.130 --> 02:01:51.010
And, we started looking
into it and realized

02:01:51.010 --> 02:01:55.360
that there's not a single tour
company in the world that run,

02:01:55.360 --> 02:01:59.190
at that time, ran an overland
expedition for tourists

02:01:59.190 --> 02:02:02.350
through the center of Northern
Oman and into the Emirates.

02:02:02.350 --> 02:02:04.920
There were tour groups that
go to Oman, and then they go

02:02:04.920 --> 02:02:07.650
to Dubai or they go to
Oman, they go to Salalah.

02:02:07.650 --> 02:02:09.730
Sometimes they go to
Nizwa, sometime, you know,

02:02:09.730 --> 02:02:12.420
they hop around but none of
them just go through the country

02:02:12.420 --> 02:02:16.220
to actually see the real
Oman, right, and those of you

02:02:16.220 --> 02:02:19.540
from Muscat know what I mean
by the real Oman, right?

02:02:19.540 --> 02:02:22.270
So, we thought this was a
really great opportunity.

02:02:22.270 --> 02:02:25.100
So, we approached our
colleagues in the travel office,

02:02:25.100 --> 02:02:28.260
National Geographic Expeditions,
of course believes in the power

02:02:28.260 --> 02:02:29.560
of science, exploration,

02:02:29.560 --> 02:02:31.100
and storytelling to
change the world.

02:02:31.100 --> 02:02:34.560
I'm not staff in the expeditions
side of the house as you heard.

02:02:34.560 --> 02:02:37.660
I'm on the nonprofit side, but
the three of us went to them,

02:02:37.660 --> 02:02:40.250
and we bullied them, and we
said, "Look, we need your help.

02:02:40.250 --> 02:02:41.950
We'd like to try this out.

02:02:41.950 --> 02:02:43.530
We'd like to experiment."

02:02:43.530 --> 02:02:45.610
They had said, "You know, we
looked at it in years past,

02:02:45.610 --> 02:02:47.850
and there wasn't even
a company on the ground

02:02:47.850 --> 02:02:50.250
that we could partner
with to make this happen."

02:02:50.250 --> 02:02:53.260
So, Aziz said, "Well, my
company, which is based

02:02:53.260 --> 02:02:58.110
in Jerusalem, will find
partners on the ground in Oman

02:02:58.110 --> 02:02:59.410
and will make it happen."

02:02:59.410 --> 02:03:01.640
And they said, "If you can do
it, then we'll make it happen."

02:03:01.640 --> 02:03:05.440
Well, luckily Aziz is amazing,
and he couldn't be here today.

02:03:05.440 --> 02:03:08.380
He actually lives in
DC, but Mejdi Tours,

02:03:08.380 --> 02:03:11.620
I just want to give a shout
out, is a really amazing company

02:03:11.620 --> 02:03:14.470
that -- they've won a number
of international awards.

02:03:14.470 --> 02:03:17.010
They work in places
as diverse as Columbia

02:03:17.010 --> 02:03:20.430
where they bring tourists to
meet with the FARC as well

02:03:20.430 --> 02:03:22.240
as government representatives.

02:03:22.240 --> 02:03:25.030
They've been running in Israel
and Palestine for over a decade.

02:03:25.030 --> 02:03:27.650
At every site in
Israel Palestine

02:03:27.650 --> 02:03:30.430
that you visit you will
have a Jewish Israeli guide,

02:03:30.430 --> 02:03:32.200
and you will have an
Arab Israeli guide

02:03:32.200 --> 02:03:35.790
and sometimes a Christian
as well, a Christian Arab,

02:03:35.790 --> 02:03:37.820
and you'll get multiple
perspectives

02:03:37.820 --> 02:03:39.980
on every site that you visit.

02:03:39.980 --> 02:03:43.360
And, the point of it interfaith
and intercultural dialogue,

02:03:43.360 --> 02:03:46.940
and people come away
completely changed in the way

02:03:46.940 --> 02:03:49.190
that they think about
the world, right?

02:03:49.190 --> 02:03:53.000
So, Aziz said I can do this
in Oman with your help,

02:03:53.000 --> 02:03:55.980
and luckily, Jeff
Rose's wife, Maggie,

02:03:55.980 --> 02:03:59.010
is absolutely brilliant
and a tour organizer.

02:03:59.010 --> 02:04:02.720
So, we had someone on the
ground who could help.

02:04:02.720 --> 02:04:04.020
[Inaudible] Yeah, I know Maggie.

02:04:04.020 --> 02:04:05.320
She's a little bit like this.

02:04:05.320 --> 02:04:06.620
She would organize
this whole room

02:04:06.620 --> 02:04:08.000
into color coordination
if you let her.

02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:12.320
So, we were very, very lucky
to have this incredible team

02:04:12.320 --> 02:04:14.450
on the ground, and
we made it work.

02:04:14.450 --> 02:04:16.710
So, the purpose of the trip

02:04:16.710 --> 02:04:20.100
and remember National Geographic
trips are intentionally designed

02:04:20.100 --> 02:04:22.550
to be educational, so
we really, really --

02:04:22.550 --> 02:04:25.320
and we don't give a test
at the end but we might,

02:04:25.320 --> 02:04:27.270
but they're very
educationally driven.

02:04:27.270 --> 02:04:30.490
And, it's -- we really
believe in the power of tourism

02:04:30.490 --> 02:04:33.590
to change the world, right, that
tourism can make a difference

02:04:33.590 --> 02:04:37.460
in how people approach their
fellow humans and other places.

02:04:37.460 --> 02:04:41.440
So, the three of us had sort
of three different reason.

02:04:41.440 --> 02:04:42.740
I'm number one, right?

02:04:42.740 --> 02:04:45.270
So, I'm an archeologist,
and I wanted people

02:04:45.270 --> 02:04:49.590
to understand the rise and
fall of urban civilizations

02:04:49.590 --> 02:04:52.050
through time, and I think Oman

02:04:52.050 --> 02:04:55.610
and the Emirates combined is a
really, really wonderful place

02:04:55.610 --> 02:04:58.130
to see this, because it is
a traditionally marginal

02:04:58.130 --> 02:05:01.240
environment that is the
environment is not generally

02:05:01.240 --> 02:05:03.900
conducive for large
urban civilization.

02:05:03.900 --> 02:05:06.810
And, yet multiple times
throughout history,

02:05:06.810 --> 02:05:08.110
starting in the Bronze Age

02:05:08.110 --> 02:05:11.470
to today you've seen the
rise of major cities.

02:05:11.470 --> 02:05:12.770
So, how does that happen

02:05:12.770 --> 02:05:15.730
and also I should note the
collapse of major cities?

02:05:15.730 --> 02:05:18.820
So, we wanted to
kind of look at that.

02:05:18.820 --> 02:05:22.180
Aziz was very keen,
obviously, to bring Americans

02:05:22.180 --> 02:05:24.810
to understand what is an Arab.

02:05:24.810 --> 02:05:26.660
How diverse are the Arab people?

02:05:26.660 --> 02:05:27.960
What is Islam?

02:05:27.960 --> 02:05:29.260
How diverse is Islam?

02:05:29.260 --> 02:05:31.560
And to learn more about
the Middle East other

02:05:31.560 --> 02:05:34.060
than what they see on
Fox News or god forbid,

02:05:34.060 --> 02:05:35.360
you know, whatever else.

02:05:35.360 --> 02:05:37.870
And, then third, and
this is definitely

02:05:37.870 --> 02:05:39.170
for those who know Jeff Rose.

02:05:39.170 --> 02:05:42.190
It was to experience the
natural beauty of Oman

02:05:42.190 --> 02:05:45.380
to really know what it
means, to be in the desert,

02:05:45.380 --> 02:05:47.230
to be in the mountains,
to be on the coast,

02:05:47.230 --> 02:05:49.800
and to really experience
everything that Oman has

02:05:49.800 --> 02:05:51.310
to offer which is
of course a lot.

02:05:51.310 --> 02:05:54.500
So, I'm just going
to zoom through this.

02:05:54.500 --> 02:05:56.330
I can always send this to
people who are interested

02:05:56.330 --> 02:05:57.630
to know what the itinerary was,

02:05:57.630 --> 02:06:00.560
but just quickly I
shall start there.

02:06:00.560 --> 02:06:03.010
We would start in the East,

02:06:03.010 --> 02:06:05.320
and people could either do
a hike-up the Wadi Shab.

02:06:05.320 --> 02:06:08.470
People forget there is standing
beautiful water in Oman.

02:06:08.470 --> 02:06:11.000
You can do a hike-up
the Wadi Shab or if --

02:06:11.000 --> 02:06:13.840
for the older, particularly
people who are disabled

02:06:13.840 --> 02:06:16.800
or older, they would go
to the Bimah Sinkhole,

02:06:16.800 --> 02:06:19.050
and then we would
go look at Qalhat.

02:06:19.050 --> 02:06:21.170
We did not walk on Qalhat,
because that is not allowed,

02:06:21.170 --> 02:06:24.850
but we would look at Qalhat, and
we'd talk about what Qalhat was

02:06:24.850 --> 02:06:27.420
and why it was important.

02:06:27.420 --> 02:06:30.040
Sorry. Then we would
do Muscat of course.

02:06:30.040 --> 02:06:31.470
We'd show them the modern city.

02:06:31.470 --> 02:06:36.180
We would talk about how Sultan
Qaboos, in his great vision,

02:06:36.180 --> 02:06:38.920
saw a way to modernize
the capitol

02:06:38.920 --> 02:06:42.530
without creating a monstrosity,
allowing the culture of Oman

02:06:42.530 --> 02:06:45.890
to come forth in the capitol
in a really beautiful way.

02:06:45.890 --> 02:06:49.060
I will give a shout out
to the visitor center

02:06:49.060 --> 02:06:50.460
at the Grand Mosque.

02:06:50.460 --> 02:06:52.230
If any of you have been --

02:06:52.230 --> 02:06:55.500
go there and have not been to
meet the women who volunteer

02:06:55.500 --> 02:06:58.600
and work in that visitor
center, it is absolutely a must.

02:06:58.600 --> 02:07:00.030
They are incredible.

02:07:00.030 --> 02:07:03.810
They're Omanis who volunteer
their time to talk to tourists

02:07:03.810 --> 02:07:07.180
about whatever awkward
questions they might ask,

02:07:07.180 --> 02:07:08.560
and they're really wonderful.

02:07:08.560 --> 02:07:12.020
And, we had multiple, multiple
American, particularly women,

02:07:12.020 --> 02:07:14.730
ask very difficult
questions, you know,

02:07:14.730 --> 02:07:16.500
"Does your husband
let you drive?"

02:07:16.500 --> 02:07:19.270
and, you know, these women
would laugh and laugh I mean,

02:07:19.270 --> 02:07:22.190
you know, but a lot of the
American women who came

02:07:22.190 --> 02:07:25.340
on our trips would literally
be in tears by the end of it,

02:07:25.340 --> 02:07:28.050
because just their whole
worldview of an Islamic

02:07:28.050 --> 02:07:30.120
or an Arab woman was
completely altered,

02:07:30.120 --> 02:07:31.420
and that was very powerful.

02:07:31.420 --> 02:07:33.960
So, huge shout out, because
I think they do a really

02:07:33.960 --> 02:07:35.260
wonderful job.

02:07:35.260 --> 02:07:38.070
We'd then go into the
mountains, go into real Oman,

02:07:38.070 --> 02:07:41.740
and we would go to Misfah, into
other of these mud work villages

02:07:41.740 --> 02:07:44.350
up in the mountains to
experience the Falaj system.

02:07:44.350 --> 02:07:48.170
We would talk about the al
Falaj and how it was created

02:07:48.170 --> 02:07:51.050
and what means and how it
creates these beautiful,

02:07:51.050 --> 02:07:53.930
beautiful paradises
up in the mountains,

02:07:53.930 --> 02:07:56.180
talk about traditional
farming practices.

02:07:56.180 --> 02:07:59.370
And, what was really wonderful
is some of these villages

02:07:59.370 --> 02:08:01.920
which are still reserved,
they have tiny,

02:08:01.920 --> 02:08:05.700
tiny little eco lodges run by
families and very few people,

02:08:05.700 --> 02:08:08.640
usually just Germans and
Poles, know about them,

02:08:08.640 --> 02:08:10.780
but they would welcome us,

02:08:10.780 --> 02:08:13.460
and they would give us a walking
tour through their village

02:08:13.460 --> 02:08:14.840
and then host us for dinner.

02:08:14.840 --> 02:08:17.430
And, it was such a
magical connection

02:08:17.430 --> 02:08:21.040
that most tourists don't have in
Oman that is meeting real Omanis

02:08:21.040 --> 02:08:23.450
in their homes and
talking to them about life

02:08:23.450 --> 02:08:25.110
in these beautiful
mediaeval villages.

02:08:25.110 --> 02:08:28.540
You have to go Nizwa, of
course, the sort of cultural

02:08:28.540 --> 02:08:31.690
and particularly the
religious heart of the country,

02:08:31.690 --> 02:08:32.990
and we would talk about that.

02:08:32.990 --> 02:08:34.880
We'd talk about the
two capitols, right,

02:08:34.880 --> 02:08:37.140
Muscat being the political
and economic capitol

02:08:37.140 --> 02:08:40.710
and Nizwa being the cultural
and religious capitol,

02:08:40.710 --> 02:08:42.580
do the for, as you must.

02:08:42.580 --> 02:08:45.120
But, I always love taking
people to Bahla, right,

02:08:45.120 --> 02:08:48.230
one of the world's largest
mud work structures,

02:08:48.230 --> 02:08:50.980
recently restored thanks
to the Italians and UNESCO

02:08:50.980 --> 02:08:52.280
and others, [inaudible].

02:08:52.280 --> 02:08:55.330
Bahla is interesting for
those who have been there,

02:08:55.330 --> 02:08:58.180
because the restauration
is absolutely beautiful,

02:08:58.180 --> 02:09:00.810
and there is not a single sign.

02:09:00.810 --> 02:09:04.420
You have absolutely no idea
what you're looking at.

02:09:04.420 --> 02:09:05.900
There's not even guides.

02:09:05.900 --> 02:09:07.340
So, it's not like you
could ask someone.

02:09:07.340 --> 02:09:11.520
So, I did as much research as
I could do and my fellow guides

02:09:11.520 --> 02:09:14.020
to give them as much
information as we could,

02:09:14.020 --> 02:09:16.010
but for a UNESCO world
heritage site that is

02:09:16.010 --> 02:09:18.300
so gorgeous we need signage.

02:09:18.300 --> 02:09:20.380
I mean, just one
sign would help.

02:09:20.380 --> 02:09:22.760
We would go from there
to the Al-Ayn Tombs

02:09:22.760 --> 02:09:24.670
which luckily don't
need much of a sign,

02:09:24.670 --> 02:09:26.310
because they're just gorgeous

02:09:26.310 --> 02:09:29.040
but we would explain
what we were looking at.

02:09:29.040 --> 02:09:32.040
Obviously, these 5000 year old
tombs never have been restored

02:09:32.040 --> 02:09:35.080
and in perfect condition
which is really wonderful,

02:09:35.080 --> 02:09:39.340
and amazingly, tourists
really connect with those.

02:09:39.340 --> 02:09:42.020
Tourists really,
for some reason,

02:09:42.020 --> 02:09:44.260
it brings the archeology
alive in a way

02:09:44.260 --> 02:09:45.560
that I always find amusing.

02:09:45.560 --> 02:09:46.860
I'm not sure why.

02:09:46.860 --> 02:09:48.200
I guess we're just
-- we work there.

02:09:48.200 --> 02:09:49.890
So, for us it's like,
"Yeah, the tombs.

02:09:49.890 --> 02:09:51.190
Yeah, yeah, yeah."

02:09:51.190 --> 02:09:53.010
And they just go, "Wow.

02:09:53.010 --> 02:09:54.310
These are incredible."

02:09:54.310 --> 02:09:56.890
So go down to Al-Ayn.

02:09:56.890 --> 02:09:58.370
We then take them to Bat, right?

02:09:58.370 --> 02:10:02.470
So, I've been working at that
with Dr. Cable and Soritas

02:10:02.470 --> 02:10:05.490
and others who are here
for almost a decade

02:10:05.490 --> 02:10:09.710
or over a decade now, and
we've done a lot of research.

02:10:09.710 --> 02:10:11.660
We've done a lot of
community outreach,

02:10:11.660 --> 02:10:15.050
a lot of education
programs, and we have a lot

02:10:15.050 --> 02:10:16.960
of Wasta [assumed spelling],
as they say, in Bat,

02:10:16.960 --> 02:10:18.450
and we're very proud of that.

02:10:18.450 --> 02:10:22.150
The people of Bat have always
welcomed us, but we struggle

02:10:22.150 --> 02:10:25.780
to find ways to bring the
site to life for tourists.

02:10:25.780 --> 02:10:28.670
Actually Charlie Cable
is working with a group,

02:10:28.670 --> 02:10:30.470
with the World Monument
Fund kind of think

02:10:30.470 --> 02:10:33.860
of a strategic plan for the
site which is really important

02:10:33.860 --> 02:10:36.370
but without someone
like one of us there,

02:10:36.370 --> 02:10:39.270
there is absolutely no point
in bringing tourists to Bat,

02:10:39.270 --> 02:10:42.200
and again, it's a world
heritage site, right?

02:10:42.200 --> 02:10:46.370
With one of us there or
with one of the local Omanis

02:10:46.370 --> 02:10:49.250
who we have trained, who
have worked with us for years

02:10:49.250 --> 02:10:52.130
and years, and they're
brilliant and wonderful.

02:10:52.130 --> 02:10:55.210
With one of them there it
brings the site to life, right?

02:10:55.210 --> 02:10:56.780
So, it's finding a way
to connect tourists

02:10:56.780 --> 02:10:59.340
with these people
who are trained,

02:10:59.340 --> 02:11:02.450
who know what they're looking
at and can help explain it,

02:11:02.450 --> 02:11:04.690
it makes a huge difference.

02:11:04.690 --> 02:11:06.650
We then would cross the border

02:11:06.650 --> 02:11:09.110
which is always a very
interesting experience

02:11:09.110 --> 02:11:10.410
for tourists.

02:11:10.410 --> 02:11:12.520
They're always shocked
by how different it is,

02:11:12.520 --> 02:11:15.120
and that difference
is really important,

02:11:15.120 --> 02:11:18.800
because it shows the
diversity of the Arab nations,

02:11:18.800 --> 02:11:21.680
that they're not all the same,
"the Gulf Arabs", you know,

02:11:21.680 --> 02:11:22.980
they're all just one thing.

02:11:22.980 --> 02:11:26.000
It's really important we
felt to cross that border

02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:28.590
and experience a different
part of the Arabian Peninsula.

02:11:28.590 --> 02:11:31.050
Obviously, we'd go
Hili, the Al Ain Museum

02:11:31.050 --> 02:11:32.350
which is a wonderful collection.

02:11:32.350 --> 02:11:34.690
Now, we have the
National Museum in Muscat,

02:11:34.690 --> 02:11:38.910
so we don't need the Al Ain
Museum as much, and then we'd go

02:11:38.910 --> 02:11:40.710
for a little bit
of luxury, right?

02:11:40.710 --> 02:11:43.830
So, the Al Maha Desert Resort
is a wonderful example.

02:11:43.830 --> 02:11:46.670
Dr. Reigner, I would encourage
you to at least research it,

02:11:46.670 --> 02:11:49.240
if you don't want to pay
the 1000 dollars a night.

02:11:49.240 --> 02:11:53.230
But, it is a wonderful
eco lodge.

02:11:53.230 --> 02:11:55.380
It is a protected
area that they --

02:11:55.380 --> 02:11:59.390
it's a breeding area for
gazelles and the oryx,

02:11:59.390 --> 02:12:03.120
and they have created what is
a fairly sustainable lodge.

02:12:03.120 --> 02:12:05.250
National Geographic
will generally only work

02:12:05.250 --> 02:12:06.720
with sustainable eco lodges.

02:12:06.720 --> 02:12:08.540
They have a number

02:12:08.540 --> 02:12:11.240
of international certifications
and sustainability.

02:12:11.240 --> 02:12:13.530
They use solar energy, they
recycle water etcetera,

02:12:13.530 --> 02:12:18.060
etcetera, but it's that
wonderful combination of tourism

02:12:18.060 --> 02:12:20.380
and preserving a
natural landscape,

02:12:20.380 --> 02:12:22.300
including breeding programs.

02:12:22.300 --> 02:12:24.190
So, that was a really
nice example

02:12:24.190 --> 02:12:26.260
that I never saw the
equivalent in Oman

02:12:26.260 --> 02:12:28.940
but the potential is huge.

02:12:28.940 --> 02:12:30.980
We then would go to Abu Dhabi.

02:12:30.980 --> 02:12:32.700
We would go to the Grand Mosque.

02:12:32.700 --> 02:12:36.030
We would go on a dhow to
talk about the coral reefs

02:12:36.030 --> 02:12:37.740
of the Gulf and how
they've been affected

02:12:37.740 --> 02:12:40.050
by development and
modernization.

02:12:40.050 --> 02:12:43.020
Many people don't know there
are coral reefs in this region.

02:12:43.020 --> 02:12:46.410
The coral reefs in the South are
actually way better preserved

02:12:46.410 --> 02:12:47.980
and way more interesting,
Southern --

02:12:47.980 --> 02:12:50.280
in Dhofar for example.

02:12:50.280 --> 02:12:52.510
But, people rarely know
about them, so we try to talk

02:12:52.510 --> 02:12:57.020
about that ecology, and
finally we'd end up in Dubai,

02:12:57.020 --> 02:13:00.030
and a lot of people say, "God,
why would you end in Dubai?"

02:13:00.030 --> 02:13:03.950
Well, first of all believe it
or not tourists know Dubai,

02:13:03.950 --> 02:13:07.800
and so you can sell the trip
on the idea that you're going

02:13:07.800 --> 02:13:10.460
to give them an educational
tour of Dubai.

02:13:10.460 --> 02:13:11.860
You're not going to casinos.

02:13:11.860 --> 02:13:13.160
You're not doing any of that.

02:13:13.160 --> 02:13:16.260
You're talking about Emirati
culture and the growth of Dubai.

02:13:16.260 --> 02:13:19.570
National Geographic
did a whole documentary

02:13:19.570 --> 02:13:22.980
about the Burj Khalifa and the
construction and what it meant

02:13:22.980 --> 02:13:25.530
for the future of Dubai
about five years ago,

02:13:25.530 --> 02:13:26.830
and we talk about that.

02:13:26.830 --> 02:13:30.210
We actually end the trip at
the very top, the VIP lounge

02:13:30.210 --> 02:13:34.010
at the Burj Khalifa, looking out
over Dubai which, of course, is,

02:13:34.010 --> 02:13:36.990
you know, one of the world's
great 21st century cities

02:13:36.990 --> 02:13:39.070
in terms of modernization
and all of the stuff,

02:13:39.070 --> 02:13:43.570
and I say to them, I always say
to them, "Look at what you see.

02:13:43.570 --> 02:13:47.100
5000 years ago this is what
Bat kind of looked like."

02:13:47.100 --> 02:13:50.610
It had towers.

02:13:50.610 --> 02:13:52.190
It had these, you
know, monuments.

02:13:52.190 --> 02:13:55.270
It was kind of the same and
look at the way Bat is now.

02:13:55.270 --> 02:13:57.740
So, in 5000 years Dubai
is going to be nothing,

02:13:57.740 --> 02:14:00.880
and that's what archeology
tells you, right?

02:14:00.880 --> 02:14:03.180
It's about rise and
fall of civilizations.

02:14:03.180 --> 02:14:05.260
You can never take
things for granted.

02:14:05.260 --> 02:14:06.730
So, we talk about
sustainability.

02:14:06.730 --> 02:14:08.370
How do you make these
cities sustainable,

02:14:08.370 --> 02:14:10.450
so they last a little bit longer

02:14:10.450 --> 02:14:12.280
than they would otherwise,
right?

02:14:12.280 --> 02:14:16.450
Powerful messages that this part
of the world explicitly can tell

02:14:16.450 --> 02:14:20.490
that very few other
places in the world can.

02:14:20.490 --> 02:14:23.050
Tourists loved it
generally speaking.

02:14:23.050 --> 02:14:24.350
People had a great time

02:14:24.350 --> 02:14:26.180
but these were definitely
adventurous tourists.

02:14:26.180 --> 02:14:29.500
They were tourists who have been
to every other place on the map,

02:14:29.500 --> 02:14:31.860
and this was an area they
had never seen before.

02:14:31.860 --> 02:14:34.070
So, they were willing to
go a little bit off-road

02:14:34.070 --> 02:14:36.670
and try something
new, which was great.

02:14:36.670 --> 02:14:39.380
We also, and just to throw out
there being National Geographic,

02:14:39.380 --> 02:14:41.540
we do run photography tours,

02:14:41.540 --> 02:14:44.720
and basically we take our
general educational tours

02:14:44.720 --> 02:14:49.290
and we just make it basically
a week-long seminar or workshop

02:14:49.290 --> 02:14:51.980
about best practices in
photography and instead

02:14:51.980 --> 02:14:53.910
of an archeologist
leading the trip,

02:14:53.910 --> 02:14:56.640
we have one of our
photographers lead the trip

02:14:56.640 --> 02:14:59.610
but we use the same itinerary,
and that was actually very,

02:14:59.610 --> 02:15:04.150
very successful, because people
who are into photography,

02:15:04.150 --> 02:15:06.970
they have a very
good eye for beauty.

02:15:06.970 --> 02:15:09.140
They're interested in
culture and nature and all

02:15:09.140 --> 02:15:11.710
of these things, and
there's a huge market for it.

02:15:11.710 --> 02:15:15.080
And, Oman is, of course,
visually stunning, right,

02:15:15.080 --> 02:15:20.360
unlike the Emirates which is
a little flat but they really,

02:15:20.360 --> 02:15:21.660
really, got into Oman.

02:15:21.660 --> 02:15:24.180
They really loved the natural
beauty, the culture of it.

02:15:24.180 --> 02:15:25.480
They just found so
many opportunities.

02:15:25.480 --> 02:15:28.270
So, that ended up being almost
more successful in terms

02:15:28.270 --> 02:15:31.420
of sales than our
educational trips.

02:15:31.420 --> 02:15:35.420
So, positive reactions
from the tourists,

02:15:35.420 --> 02:15:39.630
to the person they all said
being introduced to friendly,

02:15:39.630 --> 02:15:42.400
tolerant Arab people in the
stable and prosperous part

02:15:42.400 --> 02:15:45.280
of the Middle East completely
changed their view of what it is

02:15:45.280 --> 02:15:48.710
to be Arab and what the
Middle East is all about.

02:15:48.710 --> 02:15:51.570
They felt educated
about world history

02:15:51.570 --> 02:15:55.410
and environmentally marginal
areas, so that's good, I win.

02:15:55.410 --> 02:15:58.830
And, they -- to just point they
really enjoyed both the natural

02:15:58.830 --> 02:16:00.130
and the cultural beauty.

02:16:00.130 --> 02:16:02.890
They were surprised about
the wealth of diversity

02:16:02.890 --> 02:16:05.610
of these assets for
tourism which was great.

02:16:05.610 --> 02:16:11.040
Now, some negative
reactions, lack of information.

02:16:11.040 --> 02:16:12.340
I think we all know this.

02:16:12.340 --> 02:16:14.550
This is a key, key problem.

02:16:14.550 --> 02:16:17.750
If tourists go to sites and they
don't know what they're looking

02:16:17.750 --> 02:16:20.970
at, they're not going to say
good things about it, right?

02:16:20.970 --> 02:16:23.140
They're going to feel that
they've wasted their time.

02:16:23.140 --> 02:16:26.730
They will put that online and
then nobody will go, right?

02:16:26.730 --> 02:16:29.880
So, this is a very,
very easy way to fix it.

02:16:29.880 --> 02:16:32.820
We've been trying in Bat
for many years to do this,

02:16:32.820 --> 02:16:34.630
and we're going to
keep pushing for it.

02:16:34.630 --> 02:16:36.800
Signs are the easiest and
cheapest way to do this.

02:16:36.800 --> 02:16:42.820
We found that there was very
limited interaction normally

02:16:42.820 --> 02:16:46.330
between tourists
and their guides,

02:16:46.330 --> 02:16:49.340
even when the guides
were Omani and Emirati.

02:16:49.340 --> 02:16:52.530
They didn't -- early on
when we started the trip,

02:16:52.530 --> 02:16:54.980
the guides didn't
know how to interact

02:16:54.980 --> 02:16:56.910
with the tourists,
so they didn't.

02:16:56.910 --> 02:16:58.210
They were friendly.

02:16:58.210 --> 02:16:59.510
They were polite.

02:16:59.510 --> 02:17:01.360
They would say, "Now, we're
going to go to the Grand Mosque.

02:17:01.360 --> 02:17:03.390
Here's the Grand Mosque."

02:17:03.390 --> 02:17:05.620
But they didn't know
to talk about what's it

02:17:05.620 --> 02:17:07.740
like to be Omani, right?

02:17:07.740 --> 02:17:09.040
What is it like at home?

02:17:09.040 --> 02:17:10.820
How did you go to school?

02:17:10.820 --> 02:17:12.930
How did you learn to drive?

02:17:12.930 --> 02:17:15.310
What's your favorite,
you know, football team?

02:17:15.310 --> 02:17:18.050
These sort of things that,
again, humanize people.

02:17:18.050 --> 02:17:20.390
They make you say,
"Omanis are just like me."

02:17:20.390 --> 02:17:22.380
Right, and that's so
important, and they know

02:17:22.380 --> 02:17:23.680
that in Sultan Qaboos
Cultural Center,

02:17:23.680 --> 02:17:27.010
this is your whole mission, is
that intercultural dialogue,

02:17:27.010 --> 02:17:30.110
and I really felt that this
is something that we can work

02:17:30.110 --> 02:17:32.710
on with tourism in Oman
is teaching the guides how

02:17:32.710 --> 02:17:35.390
to open up, particularly to
Americans who, as you know,

02:17:35.390 --> 02:17:38.410
are a little overly friendly
sometimes but to learn to open

02:17:38.410 --> 02:17:40.690
up in ways that are still
comfortable to the Omani guides

02:17:40.690 --> 02:17:42.370
but allow the Americans to feel

02:17:42.370 --> 02:17:45.540
like they're learning something
what it is to be Omani,

02:17:45.540 --> 02:17:47.930
and of course tourism
infrastructure is a huge problem

02:17:47.930 --> 02:17:49.560
particularly when you
go into the interior.

02:17:49.560 --> 02:17:53.100
There are very few hotels
designed particularly

02:17:53.100 --> 02:17:56.870
for high-end tourism, and
that becomes a huge problem,

02:17:56.870 --> 02:17:58.650
because you end up having to --

02:17:58.650 --> 02:18:01.890
we would stay at the Golden
Tulip outside of Nizwa which is

02:18:01.890 --> 02:18:04.310
about the nicest you'll
get in the interior,

02:18:04.310 --> 02:18:07.850
and then we would spend one
day to see all of the sites

02:18:07.850 --> 02:18:10.860
that I just listed before
we got to the Hilih Rotana

02:18:10.860 --> 02:18:12.160
and we go through the border.

02:18:12.160 --> 02:18:16.500
It was a long day, because there
is not a single hotel anywhere

02:18:16.500 --> 02:18:17.800
in that stretch.

02:18:17.800 --> 02:18:19.170
I think in Ibri now they
have some apartment hotels

02:18:19.170 --> 02:18:21.160
or something but
they're not a sort of --

02:18:21.160 --> 02:18:22.520
it's not a common practice yet.

02:18:22.520 --> 02:18:25.230
And, I think that's an
easy way to bring tourists

02:18:25.230 --> 02:18:27.680
to the interior again
which is very helpful

02:18:27.680 --> 02:18:30.550
for the local people.

02:18:30.550 --> 02:18:34.310
Lessons learned, Omani guides
are actually quite rare.

02:18:34.310 --> 02:18:37.840
They're growing, there are
schools now, university courses

02:18:37.840 --> 02:18:40.410
to teach Omanis to be guides.

02:18:40.410 --> 02:18:42.280
They generally know how to deal

02:18:42.280 --> 02:18:44.820
with these tourists
coming off the boat.

02:18:44.820 --> 02:18:47.100
They don't know how to deal
with a high-end tourist

02:18:47.100 --> 02:18:49.270
who wants a real
authentic Omani experience,

02:18:49.270 --> 02:18:51.180
and that's something
we worked very,

02:18:51.180 --> 02:18:55.570
very hard with our Omani guides
to teach them how to do that,

02:18:55.570 --> 02:18:57.870
and they were open, and these,
you know, these guides are

02:18:57.870 --> 02:19:00.660
so smart, men and women,
Omanis are so smart

02:19:00.660 --> 02:19:03.770
and are very well trained, and
once we just showed them how,

02:19:03.770 --> 02:19:05.690
they took to it like that
and were really brilliant.

02:19:05.690 --> 02:19:06.990
I should also note some

02:19:06.990 --> 02:19:09.290
of our Omani guides were
wonderful photographers

02:19:09.290 --> 02:19:11.680
which was a talent
that they had hidden,

02:19:11.680 --> 02:19:14.050
but once we started doing the
photography tours, they brought

02:19:14.050 --> 02:19:17.200
out their own cameras, and
suddenly it became a dialogue

02:19:17.200 --> 02:19:18.880
between the Omani photographers,

02:19:18.880 --> 02:19:20.540
the National Geographic
photographer,

02:19:20.540 --> 02:19:23.630
and the tourist photographers,
which was a really wonderful way

02:19:23.630 --> 02:19:26.630
to talk about how you see
things and what you photograph

02:19:26.630 --> 02:19:28.690
and that kind of thing.

02:19:28.690 --> 02:19:30.490
Guides are often unfamiliar
with their own sights.

02:19:30.490 --> 02:19:33.600
This is obviously
around places like Bahla.

02:19:33.600 --> 02:19:35.900
You won't find a
tour guide in Oman

02:19:35.900 --> 02:19:38.580
who can actually give
you a tour of Bahla.

02:19:38.580 --> 02:19:40.270
That's a critical,
critical problem.

02:19:40.270 --> 02:19:44.170
There are very few local
travel companies actually run

02:19:44.170 --> 02:19:45.470
by Omanis.

02:19:45.470 --> 02:19:47.300
There's a number of travel
companies that are run

02:19:47.300 --> 02:19:50.900
by Indians which is sort
of typical in the Gulf

02:19:50.900 --> 02:19:52.990
to have the management
be Indian,

02:19:52.990 --> 02:19:55.670
but the guides should
absolutely be Omani.

02:19:55.670 --> 02:19:57.690
That is really, really
important,

02:19:57.690 --> 02:20:01.950
and then this is obvious I think
but just to throw it out there.

02:20:01.950 --> 02:20:04.830
High-end tourism is
sustainable tourism, right?

02:20:04.830 --> 02:20:06.780
The ethos of Oman as set

02:20:06.780 --> 02:20:11.230
by Sultan Qaboos himself was
we will modernize this country,

02:20:11.230 --> 02:20:13.510
we will advance this country,
but not at the expense

02:20:13.510 --> 02:20:14.900
of our heritage, and that is

02:20:14.900 --> 02:20:16.800
of course the brilliance
of him as a leader.

02:20:16.800 --> 02:20:20.290
If you want to do that, mass
tourism is not the answer.

02:20:20.290 --> 02:20:24.160
There's no infrastructure for
it, and it's highly destructive

02:20:24.160 --> 02:20:26.230
to heritage, and as we noticed

02:20:26.230 --> 02:20:29.420
from the cruise ships
nobody benefits really.

02:20:29.420 --> 02:20:32.280
I mean, maybe China, dumping
its products into the soup,

02:20:32.280 --> 02:20:33.580
but nobody is really benefiting.

02:20:33.580 --> 02:20:36.790
So, just to throw out there,
I really think the future

02:20:36.790 --> 02:20:39.990
of Omani tourism is
this high-end tourism

02:20:39.990 --> 02:20:43.290
where you have smaller groups
but going more in-depth,

02:20:43.290 --> 02:20:46.240
into places like the interior
and hopefully eventually

02:20:46.240 --> 02:20:49.260
to Dhofar which is
Jeff Rose's vision

02:20:49.260 --> 02:20:51.290
that we would actually
get there.

02:20:51.290 --> 02:20:54.560
So, with that thank you
all so much and happy

02:20:54.560 --> 02:20:56.510
to answer questions later.

02:20:56.510 --> 02:21:04.180
[ Applause ]

02:21:04.180 --> 02:21:05.630
&gt;&gt; Joan Weeks: Thank you
so much, Christopher.

02:21:05.630 --> 02:21:07.350
That was very fascinating.

02:21:07.350 --> 02:21:08.650
I'm ready to go.

02:21:08.650 --> 02:21:13.740
So, our next presentation is

02:21:13.740 --> 02:21:16.470
about constructing
cultural heritage,

02:21:16.470 --> 02:21:22.070
the Jewel of Muscat
Project by Dr. Eric Staples.

02:21:22.070 --> 02:21:24.900
Eric Staples is currently
an assistant professor

02:21:24.900 --> 02:21:29.240
at Zayed University, Abu Dhabi
in the United Arab Emirates.

02:21:29.240 --> 02:21:31.830
He's an interdisciplinarian,

02:21:31.830 --> 02:21:35.730
a maritime historian whose
interests include Indian ocean

02:21:35.730 --> 02:21:39.900
shipbuilding, seafaring,
and navigation.

02:21:39.900 --> 02:21:43.530
In addition to his historical
pursuits he has also been

02:21:43.530 --> 02:21:47.030
actively involved in a
variety of maritime archeology

02:21:47.030 --> 02:21:50.160
and experimental
archeological projects.

02:21:50.160 --> 02:21:54.420
From 2010 until 2016,
he was the director

02:21:54.420 --> 02:21:58.830
of the Oman Maritime overseeing
different maritime heritage

02:21:58.830 --> 02:22:01.420
projects for the
Sultanate of Oman.

02:22:01.420 --> 02:22:04.680
Dr. Staples holds a
PHD in Islamic history

02:22:04.680 --> 02:22:07.900
from the University of
California in Santa Barbara,

02:22:07.900 --> 02:22:12.120
and I was just standing over
at our display and I said,

02:22:12.120 --> 02:22:15.940
"Look at these maritime
excavations we have here

02:22:15.940 --> 02:22:17.530
on table two."

02:22:17.530 --> 02:22:21.860
And he says, "I did that book."

02:22:21.860 --> 02:22:24.510
I think that's one of the
things that's so phenomenal

02:22:24.510 --> 02:22:26.890
about our scholars today that --

02:22:26.890 --> 02:22:32.720
and for me too, to have an
archeological site that is not

02:22:32.720 --> 02:22:34.270
above ground but underground.

02:22:34.270 --> 02:22:36.570
So, Dr. Staples.

02:22:43.560 --> 02:22:44.860
&gt;&gt; Dr. Eric Staples:
Good afternoon.

02:22:44.860 --> 02:22:47.360
I would like to echo my
colleagues saying thank you

02:22:47.360 --> 02:22:50.570
first of all, Sultan
Qaboos Cultural Center,

02:22:50.570 --> 02:22:53.060
Library of Congress,
your excellency, I think,

02:22:53.060 --> 02:22:54.360
is no longer here,

02:22:54.360 --> 02:22:57.200
for organizing this
event first of all.

02:22:57.200 --> 02:22:58.940
It's been wonderful,
spectacular room.

02:22:58.940 --> 02:23:00.760
I don't think I've ever
presented in a room

02:23:00.760 --> 02:23:05.410
with this much gravitas I think.

02:23:05.410 --> 02:23:08.820
But, I would also thank you
very much for inviting me.

02:23:08.820 --> 02:23:10.670
I have a confession.

02:23:10.670 --> 02:23:14.150
I was actually invited to
present in the second panel

02:23:14.150 --> 02:23:17.600
of the day and talk about
maritime trade and technology

02:23:17.600 --> 02:23:21.780
in Middle Islamic Dhofar but
then they contacted me and said,

02:23:21.780 --> 02:23:24.610
"Would you be willing to talk
about it in the third panel."

02:23:24.610 --> 02:23:27.900
About Jewel of Muscat, and
I said, "Sure, no problem."

02:23:27.900 --> 02:23:33.310
But I have echo what every other
person in this panel has said.

02:23:33.310 --> 02:23:34.860
I know nothing about
cultural tourism

02:23:34.860 --> 02:23:39.320
or at least I thought I did
until I saw Chris's photo of me

02:23:39.320 --> 02:23:41.990
on that cultural tour and
I said, "Wait, that's me."

02:23:41.990 --> 02:23:45.490
I had actually engaged in
lectures on their tour,

02:23:45.490 --> 02:23:48.610
in our experimental [inaudible].

02:23:48.610 --> 02:23:53.250
So, well actually I know a
little bit, a small amount.

02:23:53.250 --> 02:23:56.060
As was mentioned, I think
also lesson learned,

02:23:56.060 --> 02:23:58.050
was write very short
introductions.

02:23:58.050 --> 02:24:02.690
I am primarily trained
as an historian

02:24:02.690 --> 02:24:05.060
with what you would
call sustained interest

02:24:05.060 --> 02:24:08.070
in maritime archeology and
experimental archeology

02:24:08.070 --> 02:24:09.660
which I'll talk a bit about
what that actually is.

02:24:09.660 --> 02:24:14.050
And, I've had the incredible
good fortune to have worked

02:24:14.050 --> 02:24:19.760
for eight years with a, what I'd
call, rather unique team in Oman

02:24:19.760 --> 02:24:21.500
which was basically -- this is

02:24:21.500 --> 02:24:23.000
where I push the
button I think --

02:24:23.000 --> 02:24:29.540
yes, basically a team of
archeologists, originally led

02:24:29.540 --> 02:24:32.340
by Tom Vosmer, the man
with the grey beard

02:24:32.340 --> 02:24:35.740
and the Indiana Jones hat you
can see over there who was sort

02:24:35.740 --> 02:24:39.590
of the founding father of study
of maritime technologies in Oman

02:24:39.590 --> 02:24:44.320
and the Western Indian Ocean as
well as Italian archeologists,

02:24:44.320 --> 02:24:48.910
Omani, and Indian
shipwrights, boat workers,

02:24:48.910 --> 02:24:50.670
sail makers, model makers.

02:24:50.670 --> 02:24:53.620
Engaged in a wide
variety of projects,

02:24:53.620 --> 02:24:56.480
everything from designed,
developing,

02:24:56.480 --> 02:25:02.740
and constructing museum
exhibits, oral history projects,

02:25:02.740 --> 02:25:04.590
boat documentation projects,

02:25:04.590 --> 02:25:08.350
maritime cultural landscape
projects, documentaries,

02:25:08.350 --> 02:25:09.780
etcetera, the full gamut.

02:25:09.780 --> 02:25:12.390
But, I would like today
to talk about the project

02:25:12.390 --> 02:25:14.280
that first all sort of
gathered us together,

02:25:14.280 --> 02:25:17.730
and this is the Jewel
of Muscat project.

02:25:17.730 --> 02:25:20.300
But, before I get into what
the Jewel of Muscat project,

02:25:20.300 --> 02:25:27.000
and many of you might be aware
of it, I would like to mention

02:25:27.000 --> 02:25:29.980
that Oman is rather unique
in the Western Indian Ocean

02:25:29.980 --> 02:25:33.500
in particular, but even in the
larger, almost global context,

02:25:33.500 --> 02:25:38.280
in that it has engaged
in three significant,

02:25:38.280 --> 02:25:42.040
experimental reconstruction
voyaging projects.

02:25:42.040 --> 02:25:45.760
What I actually mean by that
is basically three projects

02:25:45.760 --> 02:25:47.570
where experts get together.

02:25:47.570 --> 02:25:50.270
They try to figure out
the puzzle together,

02:25:50.270 --> 02:25:54.470
how ships that sort of enabled
all of this maritime trade

02:25:54.470 --> 02:25:55.770
and interconnection

02:25:55.770 --> 02:25:57.070
that everyone has talked
about so much today.

02:25:57.070 --> 02:26:01.670
And, then basically build
them, and then try to sail them

02:26:01.670 --> 02:26:04.030
on the historic routes
basically.

02:26:04.030 --> 02:26:06.400
The first, as you
might recognize

02:26:06.400 --> 02:26:11.220
from this rather grainy photo,
is the Sohar in 1980, '81,

02:26:11.220 --> 02:26:14.150
which was actually a
very pioneering project.

02:26:14.150 --> 02:26:16.930
Undertaken by the
Omani government,

02:26:16.930 --> 02:26:21.340
and under the direction of
the Irish inventor and writer,

02:26:21.340 --> 02:26:27.040
Tim Severin, who basically at
the time wanted to build a --

02:26:27.040 --> 02:26:31.930
an hypothesis of what a
early Islamic trading vessel

02:26:31.930 --> 02:26:34.550
that would sail to China, and
that is sort of, often sort of,

02:26:34.550 --> 02:26:37.450
referred to in the
mythical tales of Sinbad.

02:26:37.450 --> 02:26:39.460
And, then to actually
replicate that voyage.

02:26:39.460 --> 02:26:44.400
And, they built a very large,
sewn plank vessel in 1980

02:26:44.400 --> 02:26:48.350
in Sohar, Oman, an entirely
Indian team of carpenters,

02:26:48.350 --> 02:26:49.840
shipwrights, and rope workers.

02:26:49.840 --> 02:26:54.070
And, then sailed it in seven
and a half months in 1981

02:26:54.070 --> 02:26:57.490
from Muscat to China with
an international crew

02:26:57.490 --> 02:26:59.190
under the command
of Tim Severin.

02:26:59.190 --> 02:27:00.490
A remarkable journey.

02:27:00.490 --> 02:27:03.200
The book about it,
Sinbad Voyage,

02:27:03.200 --> 02:27:05.690
I highly recommend you read
it if you have a chance.

02:27:05.690 --> 02:27:07.000
Interesting, I referred to it

02:27:07.000 --> 02:27:09.190
as an experimental
reconstruction rather

02:27:09.190 --> 02:27:11.670
than an experimental,
archaeological reconstruction,

02:27:11.670 --> 02:27:13.830
because the evidence
that they were basing it

02:27:13.830 --> 02:27:15.500
on was not archaeological.

02:27:15.500 --> 02:27:17.570
They had no archaeological
evidence to really,

02:27:17.570 --> 02:27:19.270
reliably base itself on.

02:27:19.270 --> 02:27:22.000
So it was basically
on very limited set

02:27:22.000 --> 02:27:24.800
of iconography basically,
sort of, some drawings

02:27:24.800 --> 02:27:29.060
from the 13th century as
well as drawings on some maps

02:27:29.060 --> 02:27:32.150
and a handful of
textual references.

02:27:32.150 --> 02:27:36.300
The second one, Magan
Boat Three, which is part

02:27:36.300 --> 02:27:40.320
of a larger series, I
see some people smiling,

02:27:40.320 --> 02:27:41.740
is basically what I would refer

02:27:41.740 --> 02:27:44.430
to as an archaeological
floating hypothesis.

02:27:44.430 --> 02:27:47.940
Putting together some
rather diverse sets

02:27:47.940 --> 02:27:51.870
of archaeological evidence and
textual evidence to try and come

02:27:51.870 --> 02:27:54.720
up with a working model of
what a bronze age vessel

02:27:54.720 --> 02:27:57.450
that enabled all of this
early globalization,

02:27:57.450 --> 02:27:59.040
as often refer to, but sort of,

02:27:59.040 --> 02:28:01.100
what we would call,
long distance trade.

02:28:01.100 --> 02:28:07.150
This is a composite vessel
made of reeds, reed mats, rope,

02:28:07.150 --> 02:28:12.540
a bit of wood, a large amount of
bitumen as well as some leather,

02:28:12.540 --> 02:28:13.840
goat hair, even for the sail.

02:28:13.840 --> 02:28:18.230
This one, and it was
actually four have been built,

02:28:18.230 --> 02:28:21.220
this was a third, and this was
the only one to actually try

02:28:21.220 --> 02:28:22.520
to replicate a voyage.

02:28:22.520 --> 02:28:24.980
It, sort of, unfortunately
sank on its way to India,

02:28:24.980 --> 02:28:29.240
but nonetheless, what you would
call a very interesting project

02:28:29.240 --> 02:28:32.860
that the Omani government
invested heavily in.

02:28:32.860 --> 02:28:34.470
The third is the
Jewel of Muscat,

02:28:34.470 --> 02:28:38.880
which I will be actually talking
about today, but before I talk

02:28:38.880 --> 02:28:40.810
about it I find it very
interesting in talking

02:28:40.810 --> 02:28:43.180
about cultural heritage or
archaeological heritage.

02:28:43.180 --> 02:28:48.360
This is, I would say, rather
interesting about Oman

02:28:48.360 --> 02:28:52.170
in the sense that it is
specifically crafting what you

02:28:52.170 --> 02:28:56.130
would call a heritage narrative,
a maritime heritage narrative,

02:28:56.130 --> 02:28:59.860
around experimental
reconstructions,

02:28:59.860 --> 02:29:06.120
which are rather different than
your typical heritage narrative,

02:29:06.120 --> 02:29:08.680
which more focused on what
you would call geographical

02:29:08.680 --> 02:29:11.360
archaeological sites or
historical artifacts.

02:29:11.360 --> 02:29:16.120
These are modern interpretations
that provide modern stories

02:29:16.120 --> 02:29:20.840
of a hypothetical past, which I
also find sort of interesting,

02:29:20.840 --> 02:29:24.590
and sort of that modern
construction of a past --

02:29:24.590 --> 02:29:27.150
fabled past so to speak.

02:29:27.150 --> 02:29:29.960
Now the Jewel of Muscat was
a bi-government initiative

02:29:29.960 --> 02:29:34.470
between the Sultanate of Oman
and the government of Singapore,

02:29:34.470 --> 02:29:37.190
basically to do something
relatively similar to the Sohar,

02:29:37.190 --> 02:29:41.270
and build an early Islamic
sewn plank trade vessel.

02:29:41.270 --> 02:29:44.630
And, then sail it
across the Indian Ocean.

02:29:44.630 --> 02:29:46.840
Unlike the Sohar,
however, this was based

02:29:46.840 --> 02:29:49.050
on archaeological evidence.

02:29:49.050 --> 02:29:53.130
This was primarily on
the Belitung wreck,

02:29:53.130 --> 02:29:55.780
which often referred to as
the Belitung wreck largely,

02:29:55.780 --> 02:29:59.780
because it was found in 1998 off
Belitung Island in Indonesia.

02:29:59.780 --> 02:30:03.260
Many of you are probably very
well aware of this wreck.

02:30:03.260 --> 02:30:07.000
It is one of the most
significant historical wrecks

02:30:07.000 --> 02:30:08.440
for Indian Ocean trade.

02:30:08.440 --> 02:30:11.910
It's dated to the
Ninth Century CE,

02:30:11.910 --> 02:30:15.680
and it has over 60,000
artifacts.

02:30:15.680 --> 02:30:19.430
You can see here you have
some green glazed ware,

02:30:19.430 --> 02:30:20.730
rather dramatic.

02:30:20.730 --> 02:30:23.980
You have some of the earliest
examples of blue and white.

02:30:23.980 --> 02:30:26.590
The vast majority, however,
are this Cheung Sha ware.

02:30:26.590 --> 02:30:29.770
An incredible amount
of ceramics,

02:30:29.770 --> 02:30:32.700
but you also have
other often referred

02:30:32.700 --> 02:30:34.000
to as priceless treasures.

02:30:34.000 --> 02:30:36.130
This cup's actually worth,
I think, 14 million dollars,

02:30:36.130 --> 02:30:38.430
so it's not priceless, but
rather expensive, and a variety

02:30:38.430 --> 02:30:42.230
of bronze mirrors as well.

02:30:42.230 --> 02:30:47.670
Sort of, this cargo all
basically made in China was,

02:30:47.670 --> 02:30:52.100
most archaeologists assume,
was on its way to west Asia

02:30:52.100 --> 02:30:56.940
to the Islamic world to
be sold when it sank.

02:30:56.940 --> 02:31:03.390
Now, this is very fascinating
for ceramics archaeologists

02:31:03.390 --> 02:31:05.040
that are interested
in material culture,

02:31:05.040 --> 02:31:07.750
but for maritime
archaeologists and historians

02:31:07.750 --> 02:31:11.320
of maritime technology, the
real treasure was actually the

02:31:11.320 --> 02:31:12.620
wreck itself.

02:31:12.620 --> 02:31:14.890
This is the only historic wreck

02:31:14.890 --> 02:31:16.490
that has been documented
and published.

02:31:16.490 --> 02:31:17.970
There's another one,
more recent,

02:31:17.970 --> 02:31:19.960
that's currently being studied,
but hasn't been published

02:31:19.960 --> 02:31:21.620
in any depth yet in Thailand.

02:31:21.620 --> 02:31:26.470
But, this is basically, sort
of, our sole example of early

02:31:26.470 --> 02:31:31.350
to Middle Islamic maritime
trading ship that we have.

02:31:31.350 --> 02:31:35.630
And, had the director, or I
guess the person in charge

02:31:35.630 --> 02:31:38.770
of the second season of the
salvaging team, Michael Flecker,

02:31:38.770 --> 02:31:42.390
who estimated there was roughly
40 percent of the whole left,

02:31:42.390 --> 02:31:44.220
which gave us an incredible
amount of information.

02:31:44.220 --> 02:31:48.110
It has the stem, ceiling planks
that you put the cargo on.

02:31:48.110 --> 02:31:49.410
It has frames, sort

02:31:49.410 --> 02:31:52.240
of the internal ribs,
planking, and beams.

02:31:52.240 --> 02:31:56.190
But, what was even
more interesting,

02:31:56.190 --> 02:31:59.210
and what struck the
archaeologists that was engaged

02:31:59.210 --> 02:32:03.040
in the salvaging, it also
has sort of a wide variety

02:32:03.040 --> 02:32:05.530
of technical detail that was
completely lacking before.

02:32:05.530 --> 02:32:06.900
You can see here,
this is the keel.

02:32:06.900 --> 02:32:09.950
You can see the size of holes,
where the holes are located,

02:32:09.950 --> 02:32:12.870
the mortise in which
the stem is placed.

02:32:12.870 --> 02:32:17.400
This provides a much more of a
viable model for reconstruction,

02:32:17.400 --> 02:32:21.930
but even more interesting, what
was the -- Michael Flecker,

02:32:21.930 --> 02:32:23.570
the archaeologist
who specializes

02:32:23.570 --> 02:32:27.080
in Southeast Asian shipping and
Chinese shipping, and he said,

02:32:27.080 --> 02:32:29.520
"This is clearly
not Southeast Asia.

02:32:29.520 --> 02:32:31.260
This is clearly not
a Chinese vessel.

02:32:31.260 --> 02:32:32.810
This is something
very different."

02:32:32.810 --> 02:32:37.190
Particularly, because you
could see here it was entirely

02:32:37.190 --> 02:32:39.740
stitched with natural
fibers, all of the planks.

02:32:39.740 --> 02:32:41.040
There were no nails.

02:32:41.040 --> 02:32:42.930
There was no lashed lugs like
you found in Southeast Asia,

02:32:42.930 --> 02:32:46.820
and the entire vessel was held
together with natural fibers.

02:32:46.820 --> 02:32:50.080
This is around 1100
year old natural fibers

02:32:50.080 --> 02:32:53.020
with the actual ropes that
you can see stitched in this,

02:32:53.020 --> 02:32:57.340
what we call, double
vertical X pattern.

02:32:57.340 --> 02:32:59.520
So, the challenge of this
project was then how do you

02:32:59.520 --> 02:33:02.270
actually reconstruct something
like this as a modern,

02:33:02.270 --> 02:33:05.520
sort of what you would
call, replica of this.

02:33:05.520 --> 02:33:09.350
Particularly, because this
is by government initiative.

02:33:09.350 --> 02:33:12.560
The Sultanate of Oman
basically said, "We are going

02:33:12.560 --> 02:33:14.670
to build this, and give this
to the people of Singapore

02:33:14.670 --> 02:33:18.520
as a gift to showcase
with the actual artifacts

02:33:18.520 --> 02:33:20.660
that Singapore actually bought
from the salvaging company."

02:33:20.660 --> 02:33:24.640
And, so basically Tom Vosmer,

02:33:24.640 --> 02:33:26.520
the man with the Indiana
Jones hat and the gray beard,

02:33:26.520 --> 02:33:28.700
sort of was the director
of construction in Oman,

02:33:28.700 --> 02:33:31.480
the archaeologist
that was involved

02:33:31.480 --> 02:33:33.830
in the salvaging
Michael Flecker,

02:33:33.830 --> 02:33:36.580
and a maritime consultant
working for the government

02:33:36.580 --> 02:33:37.880
of Singapore, Nick
Birmingham [assumed spelling],

02:33:37.880 --> 02:33:40.640
got together, reviewed
the evidence.

02:33:40.640 --> 02:33:41.940
There were a lot
of gaps, though.

02:33:41.940 --> 02:33:43.240
It was only 40 percent.

02:33:43.240 --> 02:33:44.700
They tried to fill in the
gaps as best they could

02:33:44.700 --> 02:33:48.520
with ethnographic evidence,
with looking at iconography,

02:33:48.520 --> 02:33:50.970
to try and put together
basically this,

02:33:50.970 --> 02:33:54.100
a three dimensional design,
which was then built on a one

02:33:54.100 --> 02:33:57.640
to 15 scale model to try an
actually look, this is the type

02:33:57.640 --> 02:34:00.770
of vessel that will be built.

02:34:00.770 --> 02:34:02.750
One of the issues
involved with this is that,

02:34:02.750 --> 02:34:05.330
and it's a rather
controversial collection,

02:34:05.330 --> 02:34:08.230
being just up the road
from the Smithsonian.

02:34:08.230 --> 02:34:12.230
The Belitung wreck actually
was not excavated due

02:34:12.230 --> 02:34:13.760
to best practices
of archaeology.

02:34:13.760 --> 02:34:16.960
There was not a ministry
that was over seeing it.

02:34:16.960 --> 02:34:19.520
It was not a university
archaeology team.

02:34:19.520 --> 02:34:22.110
What it was was basically
a salvaging company

02:34:22.110 --> 02:34:24.920
that had bought the
rights to salvage it, and,

02:34:24.920 --> 02:34:29.490
so what that was basically
is that there was --

02:34:29.490 --> 02:34:32.820
Michael Flecker documented
the wreck as best he could.

02:34:32.820 --> 02:34:35.980
But, there wasn't as much
information as if it had been,

02:34:35.980 --> 02:34:38.540
what you would call,
excavated over years and years.

02:34:38.540 --> 02:34:41.430
This is sort of a lost
opportunity in many ways,

02:34:41.430 --> 02:34:42.870
but with the evidence
that we did had,

02:34:42.870 --> 02:34:44.170
we still had an incredible
amount,

02:34:44.170 --> 02:34:46.330
much more than we
ever had actually.

02:34:46.330 --> 02:34:48.860
So, what was also
very interesting,

02:34:48.860 --> 02:34:51.660
and I think what sort of eludes
to, I guess what you would call,

02:34:51.660 --> 02:34:56.050
the material connection, these
networks of Indian Ocean trade,

02:34:56.050 --> 02:34:58.590
was that the wood itself,
that was identified,

02:34:58.590 --> 02:35:03.360
comes from Africa, India,
perhaps even southeast Asia.

02:35:03.360 --> 02:35:07.670
We also have -- you
can see here,

02:35:07.670 --> 02:35:11.880
I think it's your upper right,
is basically Afzelia africana.

02:35:11.880 --> 02:35:15.280
That was a good portion of the
hull, which is from Africa.

02:35:15.280 --> 02:35:18.770
We have teak, which
historically comes from India

02:35:18.770 --> 02:35:21.790
and southeast Asia, and then
we have also Calophyllum

02:35:21.790 --> 02:35:23.090
inophyllum puna.

02:35:23.090 --> 02:35:24.920
This was not in the
archaeological record,

02:35:24.920 --> 02:35:26.650
but this is sort of what
was historically used

02:35:26.650 --> 02:35:28.350
for making masts as bars.

02:35:28.350 --> 02:35:31.300
We used that, but also in
conjunction with local woods,

02:35:31.300 --> 02:35:33.970
Acacia nilotica, a lot of --

02:35:33.970 --> 02:35:37.680
and, just [inaudible]
sort of basically as well.

02:35:37.680 --> 02:35:39.460
And, what we saw is that
basically this wood,

02:35:39.460 --> 02:35:41.670
which is over 40 tons
of wood that we used

02:35:41.670 --> 02:35:46.090
for the construction, sort
of reflected not only sort

02:35:46.090 --> 02:35:49.380
of the different
material cultures,

02:35:49.380 --> 02:35:53.660
but also represented the routes
that we were actually trying

02:35:53.660 --> 02:35:56.530
to replicate in some ways.

02:35:56.530 --> 02:36:00.590
We then had a team
of 40 archaeologists,

02:36:00.590 --> 02:36:03.140
shipwrights from India
as well as carpenters

02:36:03.140 --> 02:36:05.180
from a technical
college on Oman.

02:36:05.180 --> 02:36:07.180
And, model makers as
well, rope workers,

02:36:07.180 --> 02:36:10.840
because it was entirely
sewn, and started working.

02:36:10.840 --> 02:36:13.910
What was very interesting was
actually that they sew boats

02:36:13.910 --> 02:36:16.990
in India, and we had
expert rope workers

02:36:16.990 --> 02:36:20.900
that were actually stitching
and training our Omanis on how

02:36:20.900 --> 02:36:24.400
to actually stitch
a boat together.

02:36:24.400 --> 02:36:26.610
But, we rather foolishly thought
that we knew a fair amount

02:36:26.610 --> 02:36:28.890
about this vessel based on
the archaeological evidence.

02:36:28.890 --> 02:36:33.190
This piece is what I showed you,
that technical detail, the keel.

02:36:33.190 --> 02:36:34.490
What I had never
actually thought

02:36:34.490 --> 02:36:36.810
about is how you actually
sew this together.

02:36:36.810 --> 02:36:39.070
They had to do it five
different times to try and come

02:36:39.070 --> 02:36:41.050
up with a reliable pattern.

02:36:41.050 --> 02:36:45.250
I use this just as an example,
because every single aspect

02:36:45.250 --> 02:36:47.000
or component of the
construction was similar.

02:36:47.000 --> 02:36:49.560
We were sort of engaged
in all of these questions

02:36:49.560 --> 02:36:52.500
that never really occurred to
us until we actually were forced

02:36:52.500 --> 02:36:54.740
to try and reconstruct
it to a certain degree.

02:36:54.740 --> 02:37:00.360
Had over 37,000 holes, because
it was actually stitched.

02:37:00.360 --> 02:37:03.180
We did a rather extensive
documentation process

02:37:03.180 --> 02:37:04.570
throughout, measured
every single stitch.

02:37:04.570 --> 02:37:06.180
How long it took,
who did it, etcetera,

02:37:06.180 --> 02:37:08.710
measured every single
piece on the vessel.

02:37:08.710 --> 02:37:11.340
Did three D scans when we put
it in the water and afterwards,

02:37:11.340 --> 02:37:13.360
measured individual frames.

02:37:13.360 --> 02:37:15.050
You can also see this
is on the inside.

02:37:15.050 --> 02:37:20.990
It took about a year
to build in general.

02:37:20.990 --> 02:37:23.230
Incredible process to watch,
soft of, from beginning

02:37:23.230 --> 02:37:25.820
to end rather than sort of
trying to look at the remains

02:37:25.820 --> 02:37:27.380
and to puzzle out what
actually happened.

02:37:27.380 --> 02:37:29.530
This is her just before
we put her in the water.

02:37:29.530 --> 02:37:33.690
There were a few issues with
that, but she got in eventually,

02:37:33.690 --> 02:37:35.490
and this is during sea trials.

02:37:35.490 --> 02:37:38.040
We then spent five months
afterwards making the mast,

02:37:38.040 --> 02:37:41.070
the spars, the sails, the
rigging, doing sea trials,

02:37:41.070 --> 02:37:43.280
making sure that it
was everything okay.

02:37:43.280 --> 02:37:47.470
And, then we sailed across
the Indian Ocean on 2010

02:37:47.470 --> 02:37:51.850
over a six month period
on the basically --

02:37:51.850 --> 02:37:54.540
a month to get from
Muscat to Cochin.

02:37:54.540 --> 02:37:59.650
Spent a month in India doing
maintenance and repairs,

02:37:59.650 --> 02:38:03.620
and then two weeks to Sri Lanka,
and then over across the Bay

02:38:03.620 --> 02:38:08.660
of Bengal down through Malaysia,
and arriving in Singapore.

02:38:08.660 --> 02:38:12.140
One of the interesting things
about the journey as well was

02:38:12.140 --> 02:38:15.590
that in sort of studying the
ship, we, what you would call,

02:38:15.590 --> 02:38:17.590
maritime archaeologists
are excessively focused

02:38:17.590 --> 02:38:19.730
on construction largely, because
that's all we were actually

02:38:19.730 --> 02:38:21.030
left with.

02:38:21.030 --> 02:38:22.330
But, there are some
limited texts

02:38:22.330 --> 02:38:23.630
that actually talk
about voyaging.

02:38:23.630 --> 02:38:25.260
There's also navigational texts.

02:38:25.260 --> 02:38:26.900
We were able to encounter,
what you would call,

02:38:26.900 --> 02:38:30.050
the full spectrum of what
might one actually encounter.

02:38:30.050 --> 02:38:33.100
We had -- the crew,
I forget, yes.

02:38:33.100 --> 02:38:34.560
First of all, the
crew, which was --

02:38:34.560 --> 02:38:37.140
and, the captain of course,
Captain Saleh al-Jabri,

02:38:37.140 --> 02:38:42.500
was the command -- Omani naval
officer, 22 years' experience

02:38:42.500 --> 02:38:44.830
from the sail training
ship, the Shabab Oman.

02:38:44.830 --> 02:38:48.670
We had around 18 to
20 crew at the time.

02:38:48.670 --> 02:38:52.040
It was ten Omanis
that were a part

02:38:52.040 --> 02:38:54.050
of a 15 member permanent crew.

02:38:54.050 --> 02:39:00.270
This is the permanent crew
here, as well as two Americans.

02:39:00.270 --> 02:39:03.120
Robert Jackson is also
here, sitting over here,

02:39:03.120 --> 02:39:06.880
and myself as well as an Italian
and two Indian rope worker,

02:39:06.880 --> 02:39:09.160
carpenters in case
there were any issues.

02:39:09.160 --> 02:39:14.090
And, there were issues of
course, as well as a rotating,

02:39:14.090 --> 02:39:16.780
what you would call,
desk members.

02:39:16.780 --> 02:39:22.270
A variety of members from those
countries that we were visiting.

02:39:22.270 --> 02:39:26.090
We had two Singaporeans,
an Indian, two Sri Lankans,

02:39:26.090 --> 02:39:29.630
a Malaysian, as well
as two camera men

02:39:29.630 --> 02:39:33.970
for the National Geographic
documentary on the voyage.

02:39:33.970 --> 02:39:38.290
The father of the ship, Aba
Supina [phonetic], Tom Vosmer,

02:39:38.290 --> 02:39:42.110
and Luka, the site manager
for construction, and the goat

02:39:42.110 --> 02:39:45.470
and the chicken who did not
make it to the other end,

02:39:45.470 --> 02:39:46.770
guest members definitely.

02:39:46.770 --> 02:39:51.400
Here we all are with
our headgear.

02:39:51.400 --> 02:39:52.850
We would only wear this actually

02:39:52.850 --> 02:39:54.890
when arriving for
video purposes.

02:39:54.890 --> 02:39:56.890
Otherwise we wore
baseball hats and such.

02:39:56.890 --> 02:40:00.890
But, encountered
everything from,

02:40:00.890 --> 02:40:02.920
what you would call,
deadening calms.

02:40:02.920 --> 02:40:05.260
Like this, this sort of
epitomizes to me the first month

02:40:05.260 --> 02:40:07.570
of sailing across
the India Ocean.

02:40:07.570 --> 02:40:10.650
Just sitting for days
often, very limited wind.

02:40:10.650 --> 02:40:15.920
Our average speed was around
just over two miles an hour

02:40:15.920 --> 02:40:17.280
across the India Ocean.

02:40:17.280 --> 02:40:20.890
Gives you an idea of how
slow you can actually mean.

02:40:20.890 --> 02:40:22.380
The flip side however
is on the Bay

02:40:22.380 --> 02:40:24.300
of Bengal we encountered
perhaps too much wind

02:40:24.300 --> 02:40:25.760
when we accidentally sailed

02:40:25.760 --> 02:40:28.040
through the southern
edge of Cyclone Laila.

02:40:28.040 --> 02:40:33.020
Encountered -- here
we are, 50-knot winds,

02:40:33.020 --> 02:40:34.760
seas in the excess of
three to four meters,

02:40:34.760 --> 02:40:37.720
taking on seven tons
of sea water a day.

02:40:37.720 --> 02:40:39.070
A fair amount of -- but,

02:40:39.070 --> 02:40:41.320
what was really interesting
was how resilient

02:40:41.320 --> 02:40:42.620
and strong the ship was.

02:40:42.620 --> 02:40:46.180
A lot of the sort of historical
records say how Marco Polo says

02:40:46.180 --> 02:40:48.810
they're terrible ships, and that
he wouldn't ever ride in one,

02:40:48.810 --> 02:40:50.960
but they're actually much
stronger and more resilient

02:40:50.960 --> 02:40:53.170
than we'd actually anticipated.

02:40:53.170 --> 02:40:57.320
We also cracked our mast,
broke our mast in the squall,

02:40:57.320 --> 02:40:59.440
and fixed it, and had to
limp in and find a new mast

02:40:59.440 --> 02:41:02.210
in Sri Lanka, which again
I hadn't really considered.

02:41:02.210 --> 02:41:03.900
But, then now actually
experiencing it,

02:41:03.900 --> 02:41:05.430
and going through all
of the Arabic literature

02:41:05.430 --> 02:41:06.730
of the time period, I'm --

02:41:06.730 --> 02:41:08.310
we're finding references
to broken masts everywhere,

02:41:08.310 --> 02:41:12.450
and sort of reevaluating
and sort of trade routes

02:41:12.450 --> 02:41:14.560
and the degrees to which
the difficult we've had

02:41:14.560 --> 02:41:15.860
in finding masts.

02:41:15.860 --> 02:41:19.050
Often, sort of timber
sources along these routes is

02:41:19.050 --> 02:41:20.350
very important.

02:41:20.350 --> 02:41:23.570
We also had to wonderful
opportunity to experiment

02:41:23.570 --> 02:41:26.650
with Western Indian
Ocean navigation,

02:41:26.650 --> 02:41:27.950
what we referred to it.

02:41:27.950 --> 02:41:29.250
It wasn't ninth century.

02:41:29.250 --> 02:41:34.350
The only texts we have on Indian
Ocean navigation are from 15th

02:41:34.350 --> 02:41:35.650
and 16th centuries,
[foreign language spoken],

02:41:35.650 --> 02:41:39.810
but we took both those texts
with us, and we did a variety

02:41:39.810 --> 02:41:43.230
of celestial sort of star
altitude measurements while we

02:41:43.230 --> 02:41:45.950
were actually traveling across.

02:41:45.950 --> 02:41:48.020
Navigation was GPS,
full admission,

02:41:48.020 --> 02:41:52.330
but we were experimenting with
it sort of a rather interesting

02:41:52.330 --> 02:41:54.690
and unusual conclusions.

02:41:54.690 --> 02:41:57.970
There was also, what you would
call, a whole other educational,

02:41:57.970 --> 02:42:04.010
popular media, and diplomatic
dimensions to the project.

02:42:04.010 --> 02:42:06.780
This was on one hand a gift
from one nation to another,

02:42:06.780 --> 02:42:08.830
so diplomatic relations
were being strengthened

02:42:08.830 --> 02:42:10.930
on visiting every country.

02:42:10.930 --> 02:42:13.980
Elaborate banquets, some of the
best banquets I've ever been

02:42:13.980 --> 02:42:15.510
to were on this voyage.

02:42:15.510 --> 02:42:19.210
But, there was also a
pronounced educational element,

02:42:19.210 --> 02:42:23.010
both within Oman, we had
over 20,000 students come

02:42:23.010 --> 02:42:26.500
through our humble boat
yard looking at sort of how

02:42:26.500 --> 02:42:28.630
to actually build a sewn
vessel, learning more

02:42:28.630 --> 02:42:31.240
about their maritime
heritage in general,

02:42:31.240 --> 02:42:36.050
but also engaging students
and doing academic workshops

02:42:36.050 --> 02:42:37.660
as we were on the voyage.

02:42:37.660 --> 02:42:40.840
This is my colleague Alessandro
Ghidoni, demonstrating how

02:42:40.840 --> 02:42:44.400
to use a Hashiba [phonetic]
navigational instrument

02:42:44.400 --> 02:42:47.800
to a group of Sri Lankan
school children as well,

02:42:47.800 --> 02:42:51.340
and we were doing this India and
Malaysia and Singapore as well.

02:42:51.340 --> 02:42:53.050
So, the whole goal
of it was sort

02:42:53.050 --> 02:42:55.360
of educational at the same time.

02:42:55.360 --> 02:43:00.400
Now, what does this have to
do with cultural tourism?

02:43:00.400 --> 02:43:04.910
Yes, this was the
puzzle I was trying

02:43:04.910 --> 02:43:06.680
to put this presentation
together to make it sort

02:43:06.680 --> 02:43:08.780
of connect in some
way, shape, or form.

02:43:08.780 --> 02:43:12.210
But, one of the very interesting
things I have to admit

02:43:12.210 --> 02:43:14.950
on this voyage is
that in participating

02:43:14.950 --> 02:43:17.670
in this entire project
of about two years,

02:43:17.670 --> 02:43:21.450
I have to admit I was
originally, before participating

02:43:21.450 --> 02:43:25.340
in this project, I was rather
skeptical of the benefits

02:43:25.340 --> 02:43:27.700
of experimental archaeology
to a certain degree.

02:43:27.700 --> 02:43:31.020
This project completely
converted me.

02:43:31.020 --> 02:43:34.130
I felt in the two years that I
engaged in this I learned more

02:43:34.130 --> 02:43:35.930
than my several years,
I don't want

02:43:35.930 --> 02:43:39.060
to admit how many,
in graduate school.

02:43:39.060 --> 02:43:40.820
And, what I found to be --

02:43:40.820 --> 02:43:42.560
it was an incredibly
educational experience.

02:43:42.560 --> 02:43:46.630
And, it also occurred to me
the ways in which a ship,

02:43:46.630 --> 02:43:50.140
in particular an experimental,
archaeological reconstruction,

02:43:50.140 --> 02:43:55.890
is the ideal platform for
cultural tourism tours

02:43:55.890 --> 02:44:01.050
for high-end, sustainable
tourism that say, for example,

02:44:01.050 --> 02:44:03.380
Dr. Thornton is talking about,

02:44:03.380 --> 02:44:08.550
that combine not just cultural
tourism, but also engage them

02:44:08.550 --> 02:44:13.030
in research, educational
research basically as well.

02:44:13.030 --> 02:44:16.420
So, this is my suggestion as a
potential, what you would call,

02:44:16.420 --> 02:44:20.950
innovative and unusual and
potentially fertile way of,

02:44:20.950 --> 02:44:25.520
what you would call,
exploring the cultural tourism

02:44:25.520 --> 02:44:28.030
opportunities and emphasizing
the maritime heritage of Oman.

02:44:28.030 --> 02:44:29.830
All right, thank you very much.

02:44:29.830 --> 02:44:35.050
[ Applause ]

02:44:35.050 --> 02:44:37.810
My apologies.

02:44:37.810 --> 02:44:41.870
They cut it off, thank you
to every -- the project --

02:44:41.870 --> 02:44:43.180
yes, thank you, my
acknowledgments.

02:44:43.180 --> 02:44:47.710
This was a huge project that had
an incredible amount of people.

02:44:47.710 --> 02:44:49.630
I would be here for another
20 minutes mentioning them all

02:44:49.630 --> 02:44:53.220
if I had, but very thankful to,

02:44:53.220 --> 02:44:54.750
first of all, the
Omani government.

02:44:54.750 --> 02:44:58.320
His majesty the Sultan, for
actually having the vision

02:44:58.320 --> 02:45:01.550
to initiate it, but also the
project was run by the Ministry

02:45:01.550 --> 02:45:05.720
of Foreign Affairs under his
secretary general's office,

02:45:05.720 --> 02:45:08.990
his excellency Sayyid
Badr Al-Busaidi,

02:45:08.990 --> 02:45:13.480
as well as Dr. Sayyid's
office, the office --

02:45:13.480 --> 02:45:16.130
I always mess it up, but
the adviser to his majesty,

02:45:16.130 --> 02:45:18.290
the Sultan, for cultural
affairs.

02:45:18.290 --> 02:45:21.150
As well as the Ministry of
Man Power for providing many

02:45:21.150 --> 02:45:25.120
of the Omani carpenters as
well, and the Singapore Ministry

02:45:25.120 --> 02:45:29.060
of Foreign Affairs, the
Singapore Tourism Board,

02:45:29.060 --> 02:45:31.820
as well as all of the
wonderful photographers

02:45:31.820 --> 02:45:34.640
and technical [inaudible]
that provided the images.

02:45:34.640 --> 02:45:37.090
The only image in that entire
presentation is actually this

02:45:37.090 --> 02:45:39.870
one of mine, is the only
photo that actually worth --

02:45:39.870 --> 02:45:42.000
Robert takes -- an
excellent photographer,

02:45:42.000 --> 02:45:43.300
a large amount of credit.

02:45:43.300 --> 02:45:46.960
But, thank you to all of them
and the construction crew

02:45:46.960 --> 02:45:48.260
and the sailing crew as well.

02:45:48.260 --> 02:45:50.060
Thank you again, all right.

02:45:50.060 --> 02:45:55.280

&gt;&gt; Joan Weeks: Thank you
so much, Dr. Staples.

02:45:57.100 --> 02:45:59.800
That was absolutely fascinating.

02:45:59.800 --> 02:46:04.360
Ready for a ride on the replica.

02:46:04.360 --> 02:46:07.390
I think we have about two,
three minutes for a couple

02:46:07.390 --> 02:46:10.920
of questions, and then
we'll do a little wrap up.

02:46:10.920 --> 02:46:13.510
So, does someone have a
question for our panelists?

02:46:13.510 --> 02:46:18.120
[ Inaudible ]

02:46:18.120 --> 02:46:20.250
&gt;&gt; Audience Member: All right,
if this was already covered

02:46:20.250 --> 02:46:23.250
when I was out for a
minute, I apologize

02:46:23.250 --> 02:46:24.900
and withdraw the question.

02:46:24.900 --> 02:46:27.480
Did any of you place in context

02:46:27.480 --> 02:46:34.190
for the audience the various
places that various people say

02:46:34.190 --> 02:46:39.510
that Ahmad ibn Majid was
from, born and raised?

02:46:39.510 --> 02:46:40.810
Some say Tulfa [assumed
spelling]

02:46:40.810 --> 02:46:42.410
in Ruselkama [assumed spelling],

02:46:42.410 --> 02:46:46.890
some say Suah [assumed
spelling], and others say,

02:46:46.890 --> 02:46:49.230
well look at where
-- it's Sinbad.

02:46:49.230 --> 02:46:52.760
That means probably
something closer to Karachi.

02:46:52.760 --> 02:46:55.050
It would educate
all of us, I think,

02:46:55.050 --> 02:47:02.660
if you were to generalize,
specifically clear that up.

02:47:02.660 --> 02:47:06.420
&gt;&gt; Dr. Muhannad Salhi: I
will answer this question.

02:47:06.420 --> 02:47:10.000
Ahmad ibn Majid was
born actually in Galfar,

02:47:10.000 --> 02:47:13.870
and he is an Omani when it
was United Arab Emirates,

02:47:13.870 --> 02:47:15.170
part of Oman.

02:47:15.170 --> 02:47:16.470
&gt;&gt; Audience Member:
That's right.

02:47:16.470 --> 02:47:17.770
&gt;&gt; Dr. Muhannad Salhi: So, we
don't have a doubt where he was,

02:47:17.770 --> 02:47:22.960
or what they call it, where he
was born and the nationality.

02:47:22.960 --> 02:47:26.510
And, we connect Ahmad ibn
Majid with Sinbad, yes.

02:47:26.510 --> 02:47:31.040

02:47:31.040 --> 02:47:32.340
&gt;&gt; Dr. Eric Staples:
Sure, [inaudible].

02:47:32.340 --> 02:47:35.080
&gt;&gt; Audience Member:
I felt like Joan.

02:47:35.080 --> 02:47:43.440
I felt like going sailing
on your dhow, but I wanted

02:47:43.440 --> 02:47:47.500
to ask what about
modern facilities?

02:47:47.500 --> 02:47:54.260
What about sailing such
a long distance on a ship

02:47:54.260 --> 02:48:01.110
that was structured
basically, what, 1000 years ago,

02:48:01.110 --> 02:48:06.660
how do you as a modern
person are able to sail

02:48:06.660 --> 02:48:08.280
for such a long distance

02:48:08.280 --> 02:48:13.130
in a ship really not equipped
the way a modern ship is?

02:48:13.130 --> 02:48:19.340
And, also I wanted to ask
about safety, in other words,

02:48:19.340 --> 02:48:25.730
you know, Sinbad the sailor and
the -- has all these adventures,

02:48:25.730 --> 02:48:30.230
and there's always the ship that
is hit by a wave or by a whale,

02:48:30.230 --> 02:48:32.140
and he ends up on an island.

02:48:32.140 --> 02:48:35.730
And, you know, until
another ship sails by,

02:48:35.730 --> 02:48:41.140
and then he takes it, but
you were going to Singapore.

02:48:41.140 --> 02:48:44.260
There are these huge
storms, and so on.

02:48:44.260 --> 02:48:48.250
Was there some form of
security that you had?

02:48:48.250 --> 02:48:50.630
Where there some plane
hovering above you?

02:48:50.630 --> 02:48:53.640
Was there another
ship, you know,

02:48:53.640 --> 02:48:57.730
motorized boat to help you?

02:48:57.730 --> 02:49:00.240
So, I'm just trying to think

02:49:00.240 --> 02:49:04.770
about a modern sailor
sailing on an old ship.

02:49:04.770 --> 02:49:07.840
What is that experience like?

02:49:07.840 --> 02:49:09.140
&gt;&gt; Dr. Eric Staples: I think --

02:49:09.140 --> 02:49:12.350
I think anyone that
experiences this had

02:49:12.350 --> 02:49:13.650
to be truly honest
with themselves.

02:49:13.650 --> 02:49:17.370
You're not actually experiencing
what they experienced,

02:49:17.370 --> 02:49:19.510
and I think that's impossible.

02:49:19.510 --> 02:49:21.680
And, I don't think we
were even engaging in,

02:49:21.680 --> 02:49:24.370
what's often called,
experiential learning,

02:49:24.370 --> 02:49:28.450
sort of like these
Civil War reenactments.

02:49:29.470 --> 02:49:33.390
We were trying to best
understand what we could

02:49:33.390 --> 02:49:35.210
document about the
sailing performance.

02:49:35.210 --> 02:49:38.520
We also, with the --
what you would call,

02:49:38.520 --> 02:49:40.500
with the Western Indian
Ocean pre-modern navigation,

02:49:40.500 --> 02:49:42.620
we were trying to
sort of put the pieces

02:49:42.620 --> 02:49:46.190
of the puzzle together in
ways that haven't applied

02:49:46.190 --> 02:49:47.490
to say Polynesian navigation.

02:49:47.490 --> 02:49:49.540
They learned a fair amount
from Polynesian navigation

02:49:49.540 --> 02:49:52.250
by actually applying it rather
than just reading about it.

02:49:52.250 --> 02:50:00.460
But, the motto of the voyage
was 21st century safety,

02:50:00.460 --> 02:50:01.760
ninth century everything else.

02:50:01.760 --> 02:50:05.320
Now, again that wasn't
completely accurate.

02:50:05.320 --> 02:50:09.260
We had Snickers, and a few
other modern amenities,

02:50:09.260 --> 02:50:13.770
but the safety was
obviously a concern.

02:50:13.770 --> 02:50:18.240
It was a concern throughout,
so we were doing --

02:50:18.240 --> 02:50:20.890
and, I think it's a
testament to Captain Saleh

02:50:20.890 --> 02:50:22.190
and his navy training.

02:50:22.190 --> 02:50:23.490
He was doing constant drills.

02:50:23.490 --> 02:50:26.020
We were doing constant fire
drills, man over board drills.

02:50:26.020 --> 02:50:30.430
Robert, in addition to being
one of the crew members,

02:50:30.430 --> 02:50:34.410
was also our medic as well
and was trained for that.

02:50:34.410 --> 02:50:37.980
We had life rafts on
board basically as sort

02:50:37.980 --> 02:50:40.120
of emergency life rafts
for all the vessels.

02:50:40.120 --> 02:50:46.200
We were required to wear life
-- inflatable life jackets

02:50:46.200 --> 02:50:47.940
and harnesses at night,

02:50:47.940 --> 02:50:50.580
and I think it's a
testament we actually --

02:50:50.580 --> 02:50:53.610
no one ever fell overboard
during the actual voyage.

02:50:53.610 --> 02:50:56.020
Two people fell overboard
during the sea trials

02:50:56.020 --> 02:50:57.320
in rather humorous events,

02:50:57.320 --> 02:50:59.960
but during the actual voyage
no one actually fell overboard,

02:50:59.960 --> 02:51:01.730
and that was a testament
to the training.

02:51:01.730 --> 02:51:05.350
We did have an escort vessel for
the Malaysian portion largely,

02:51:05.350 --> 02:51:07.130
because we were sailing
through the Straits of Malacca.

02:51:07.130 --> 02:51:09.920
We had no engine, and
it's a very narrow passage

02:51:09.920 --> 02:51:12.420
with an incredible amount
of modern shipping coming

02:51:12.420 --> 02:51:14.670
through that cannot
basically turn.

02:51:14.670 --> 02:51:19.340
So, and we -- very challenging,
we would go 50 miles forward

02:51:19.340 --> 02:51:23.100
and 50 miles back
due to the currents

02:51:23.100 --> 02:51:25.470
and having a escort vessel
there for that, but the rest

02:51:25.470 --> 02:51:30.100
of it we were without an escort
vessel basically once we left

02:51:30.100 --> 02:51:31.400
Omani waters.

02:51:31.400 --> 02:51:36.260
So, but that being said I
felt much safer on the vessel

02:51:36.260 --> 02:51:37.560
than you would probably think.

02:51:37.560 --> 02:51:41.750
In some ways I, full disclosure,
I grew up on sail boats.

02:51:41.750 --> 02:51:44.000
I spent about ten years of
my life living on sail boats.

02:51:44.000 --> 02:51:46.790
What was immediately
apparent was not

02:51:46.790 --> 02:51:48.090
so much the safety issues.

02:51:48.090 --> 02:51:50.710
I trusted the vessel to
an incredible degree,

02:51:50.710 --> 02:51:54.370
but was the -- how much more
labor intensive the entire

02:51:54.370 --> 02:51:55.670
project was.

02:51:55.670 --> 02:51:57.920
You know, to raise a
sail took eight people.

02:51:57.920 --> 02:52:01.610
It -- you know, and to
raise both sails you needed,

02:52:01.610 --> 02:52:02.910
you know, 16 people.

02:52:02.910 --> 02:52:06.080
You needed full crew, and
-- but, also, you know,

02:52:06.080 --> 02:52:09.700
experimenting with traditional
latrines I think was the term,

02:52:09.700 --> 02:52:12.010
toiletries and traditional
cooking methods,

02:52:12.010 --> 02:52:13.630
and all the rest of it
was also very interesting

02:52:13.630 --> 02:52:15.930
and educational I would say.

02:52:15.930 --> 02:52:18.510
I hope that's answered
your question, yes.

02:52:18.510 --> 02:52:21.330
[ Inaudible ]

02:52:21.330 --> 02:52:23.040
&gt;&gt; Audience Member: So, the
question is for Dr. Chris.

02:52:23.040 --> 02:52:25.780
You showed a slide where you
gave us the sort of impression

02:52:25.780 --> 02:52:28.590
that most American tourists
don't go beyond the superficial,

02:52:28.590 --> 02:52:30.700
Muttrah Souq and all that.

02:52:30.700 --> 02:52:32.670
The impression I get,
and I could be wrong,

02:52:32.670 --> 02:52:35.890
is that German tourists tend
to be a little more in depth

02:52:35.890 --> 02:52:37.190
when it comes to Oman.

02:52:37.190 --> 02:52:39.940
They tend to go to, you know,
places beyond Muttrah Souq.

02:52:39.940 --> 02:52:42.360
Do you have an opinion
or theory as to why is it

02:52:42.360 --> 02:52:45.580
that German tourists are
more -- I mean, are they --

02:52:45.580 --> 02:52:48.360
is Oman marketed better
towards them compared

02:52:48.360 --> 02:52:50.410
to what is being done
towards Americans,

02:52:50.410 --> 02:52:51.710
or are they just
more adventurous?

02:52:51.710 --> 02:52:54.010
&gt;&gt; Dr. Chris: Yeah, so this
is a fully qualitative answer,

02:52:54.010 --> 02:52:56.130
because I have not
looked into the data,

02:52:56.130 --> 02:52:59.980
but from my observations
the vast majority

02:52:59.980 --> 02:53:02.620
of German tourists
are the cruise ship,

02:53:02.620 --> 02:53:04.680
pour into the Muttrah
Souq, buy a dishdasha,

02:53:04.680 --> 02:53:06.170
and get back on the boat.

02:53:06.170 --> 02:53:09.040
The ones that you're
referring to is,

02:53:09.040 --> 02:53:12.010
when you go into the interior
you'll be out in the middle

02:53:12.010 --> 02:53:15.950
of nowhere, and you'll run
into a random group of hikers

02:53:15.950 --> 02:53:18.860
who are inevitably German or
Polish, and they're living

02:53:18.860 --> 02:53:21.340
out in, you know, somewhere
out in the mountains.

02:53:21.340 --> 02:53:22.720
And, they're a little
more adventurous,

02:53:22.720 --> 02:53:25.570
and I think there is a marketing

02:53:25.570 --> 02:53:27.790
that through certain
travel companies.

02:53:27.790 --> 02:53:31.030
So, for example, when we would
go to these medieval villages

02:53:31.030 --> 02:53:33.930
and to these little eco
lodges, the only places

02:53:33.930 --> 02:53:35.870
that they were really
getting tourists

02:53:35.870 --> 02:53:37.310
from were Germany and Poland.

02:53:37.310 --> 02:53:41.570
And, again they were getting
maybe five a month, right, very,

02:53:41.570 --> 02:53:44.460
very, very, very small, and
this is not high-end tourism.

02:53:44.460 --> 02:53:46.260
It's more like adventure
tourism.

02:53:46.260 --> 02:53:48.060
These are people who like to
go hiking in the mountains.

02:53:48.060 --> 02:53:51.280
They want to disappear,
so they plop their stuff

02:53:51.280 --> 02:53:53.730
at the eco lodge, and they
take a tent and off they go,

02:53:53.730 --> 02:53:56.550
and then the eco lodge doesn't
see them for three days.

02:53:56.550 --> 02:53:58.470
But, it's a very, I
think, qualitatively,

02:53:58.470 --> 02:54:00.940
it's a very small
minority of tourists,

02:54:00.940 --> 02:54:03.610
and I could not guess
how that happened or why,

02:54:03.610 --> 02:54:05.950
but it seems to be the case.

02:54:12.400 --> 02:54:14.510
&gt;&gt; Dr. Joy McCorriston: Hi,
this is really for all of you,

02:54:14.510 --> 02:54:18.640
but as someone who works in
Dhofar, I just want to --

02:54:18.640 --> 02:54:21.600
I mean, my impression
of tourism in Oman is

02:54:21.600 --> 02:54:23.830
that the vast majority
of tourists

02:54:23.830 --> 02:54:28.380
in Oman are Emiratis coming down
to enjoy, and Saudis perhaps,

02:54:28.380 --> 02:54:31.870
coming to enjoy the
Dhofar monsoon.

02:54:31.870 --> 02:54:36.290
And, so in anything that is sort
of interpretive and thinking

02:54:36.290 --> 02:54:41.180
about sustainability, I assume
that that group also would need

02:54:41.180 --> 02:54:45.630
to be very much consulted and
in the picture of, sort of,

02:54:45.630 --> 02:54:48.190
objectives in future
development,

02:54:48.190 --> 02:54:52.190
at least for the southern part.

02:54:52.190 --> 02:54:54.580
&gt;&gt; Dr. Chris: Yeah, obviously
I don't work in Dhofar.

02:54:54.580 --> 02:54:56.020
I think you're absolutely
right, Joy.

02:54:56.020 --> 02:54:58.540
That is a major a
tour group in Dhofar

02:54:58.540 --> 02:55:00.240
that needs to be considered.

02:55:00.240 --> 02:55:03.120
In the north, one thing that
I know Dr. Cable has worked

02:55:03.120 --> 02:55:05.700
on a lot at Bat, is that
fact that the vast majority

02:55:05.700 --> 02:55:09.760
of tourists that come to
Bat are actually Omanis.

02:55:09.760 --> 02:55:12.750
And, that's a demographic that's
not often talked about even

02:55:12.750 --> 02:55:15.040
by the Ministry of Tourism,
because they're Omanis.

02:55:15.040 --> 02:55:16.410
They're not tourists.

02:55:16.410 --> 02:55:18.730
But, they are actually
the largest group

02:55:18.730 --> 02:55:20.030
that would come to Bat.

02:55:20.030 --> 02:55:23.260
And, so Dr. Cable
worked for two years

02:55:23.260 --> 02:55:25.330
with two local women
in particular.

02:55:25.330 --> 02:55:28.000
So, we would often get women
groups, right, Charlotte?

02:55:28.000 --> 02:55:30.950
It was the large groups of Omani
women who would come together

02:55:30.950 --> 02:55:33.540
in a big van, and they'd
go to see the site,

02:55:33.540 --> 02:55:36.360
and then they'd get back in the
van and go where ever they went.

02:55:36.360 --> 02:55:40.570
And, Charlotte worked with
two local women to get a bunch

02:55:40.570 --> 02:55:43.620
of signs and information
made in Arabic,

02:55:43.620 --> 02:55:45.900
specifically targeting
both the local schools,

02:55:45.900 --> 02:55:48.180
but also these Omani tourists.

02:55:48.180 --> 02:55:51.120
So, I think to your point Joy,
it's not just about Americans

02:55:51.120 --> 02:55:52.920
and Germans and French coming.

02:55:52.920 --> 02:55:57.350
There's also a huge, huge market
for Omanis and other, you know,

02:55:57.350 --> 02:55:59.840
Arab tourists to this
region, particularly

02:55:59.840 --> 02:56:01.490
to Dhofar during
the summer months,

02:56:01.490 --> 02:56:02.880
and that isn't often considered,

02:56:02.880 --> 02:56:04.180
and I think that's a
really important point.

02:56:04.180 --> 02:56:06.480
Thank you.

02:56:09.460 --> 02:56:11.390
