[music playing]

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:11.834
NARRATOR: This rugged border
land between England and Wales

00:00:11.834 --> 00:00:15.734
was the scene of many
battles over the centuries,

00:00:15.734 --> 00:00:18.934
and it's a place with a rich
tradition of ghost stories.

00:00:22.867 --> 00:00:26.767
Sal Masekela and historian
Davit Mills Daniels

00:00:26.767 --> 00:00:31.367
are on the trail of England's
last known sin eater, a man

00:00:31.367 --> 00:00:35.033
whose job was to
rid the dead of sin

00:00:35.033 --> 00:00:37.200
and purge the land of ghosts.

00:00:40.166 --> 00:00:42.834
Here we are at Richard
Munslow's tombstone.

00:00:42.834 --> 00:00:44.166
This is his actual gravestone?

00:00:44.166 --> 00:00:45.166
Yeah, this is it.

00:00:45.166 --> 00:00:46.467
Wow.

00:00:46.467 --> 00:00:47.934
So this is the final sin eater.

00:00:47.934 --> 00:00:49.300
Look at that.

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:55.633
And there you see family
as children, four children.

00:00:55.633 --> 00:00:59.834
Wow, this gives more of a
sense of him as a person.

00:00:59.834 --> 00:01:01.300
Yeah, it does.

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:05.100
And you mentioned earlier that
usually it was poor people that

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.166
chose to practice this,
almost out of necessity,

00:01:09.166 --> 00:01:10.834
not necessarily choice.

00:01:10.834 --> 00:01:14.567
Munslow was a
farmer, a family man,

00:01:14.567 --> 00:01:17.200
he seemed like he was
fairly successful.

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.800
Why would he choose this?

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.333
Yeah, it is a curious choice.

00:01:21.333 --> 00:01:22.934
In particular,
someone like Munslow.

00:01:22.934 --> 00:01:24.433
The basic motivation
Munslow seems to have had

00:01:24.433 --> 00:01:26.300
is that his children
died quite suddenly.

00:01:29.967 --> 00:01:32.734
NARRATOR: Three of Munslow's
young children took sick

00:01:32.734 --> 00:01:38.433
and died in a
single week in 1817.

00:01:38.433 --> 00:01:42.667
Davit believes Munslow may have
linked his personal tragedy

00:01:42.667 --> 00:01:47.433
to the notion that unforgiven
sins were haunting the village.

00:01:47.433 --> 00:01:50.166
This fear is about the souls
from the dead coming back

00:01:50.166 --> 00:01:51.767
to haunt their own society.

00:01:51.767 --> 00:01:53.900
What the senator was
doing was saving society

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:56.100
from the negative
consequences of sin.

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.834
So while they were
viewed somewhat as a pariah

00:01:59.834 --> 00:02:02.033
within the community,
there is also

00:02:02.033 --> 00:02:03.967
this sense of this is a value.

00:02:03.967 --> 00:02:05.000
Right, yes.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.400
Christ taken with
sins of the world,

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.367
but he has to die for
that to make it happen.

00:02:08.367 --> 00:02:10.333
And so Munslow, he's
agreed to be damned.

00:02:10.333 --> 00:02:12.767
Munslow seemed to have
viewed it as this act

00:02:12.767 --> 00:02:13.567
of self-sacrificial love.

00:02:20.066 --> 00:02:23.200
Personal tragedy
led Richard Munslow

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.467
to become the last sin eater.

00:02:26.467 --> 00:02:29.333
Bereft by the loss
of his children,

00:02:29.333 --> 00:02:34.400
he sacrificed his soul to save
the soul of his community.

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.200
He provided grieving families
with a sense of peace that he

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.200
himself would never know.

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.867
For someone already
so heavily burdened,

00:02:43.867 --> 00:02:45.667
it was an incredibly noble act.

00:02:45.667 --> 00:02:48.000
