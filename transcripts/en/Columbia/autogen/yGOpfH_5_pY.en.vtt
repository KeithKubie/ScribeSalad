00:21:44.140 --> 00:21:44.150
because the Save Darfur messages seem to
 

00:21:44.150 --> 00:21:46.930
because the Save Darfur messages seem to
imply that these 400,000 had died of

00:21:46.930 --> 00:21:46.940
imply that these 400,000 had died of
 

00:21:46.940 --> 00:21:50.770
imply that these 400,000 had died of
violence they were killed and I realized

00:21:50.770 --> 00:21:50.780
violence they were killed and I realized
 

00:21:50.780 --> 00:21:51.280
violence they were killed and I realized
the

00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:51.290
the
 

00:21:51.290 --> 00:21:52.600
the
there was a difference between the

00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:52.610
there was a difference between the
 

00:21:52.610 --> 00:21:54.280
there was a difference between the
numbers killed and the numbers who had

00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:54.290
numbers killed and the numbers who had
 

00:21:54.290 --> 00:21:58.000
numbers killed and the numbers who had
died and the difference was that the

00:21:58.000 --> 00:21:58.010
died and the difference was that the
 

00:21:58.010 --> 00:22:00.730
died and the difference was that the
deaths were from multiple causes the

00:22:00.730 --> 00:22:00.740
deaths were from multiple causes the
 

00:22:00.740 --> 00:22:02.980

waho research in the credit research
 

00:22:02.990 --> 00:22:05.730
waho research in the credit research
pointed out that there were two causes

00:22:05.730 --> 00:22:05.740
pointed out that there were two causes
 

00:22:05.740 --> 00:22:07.990
pointed out that there were two causes
one cause was drought and

00:22:07.990 --> 00:22:08.000
one cause was drought and
 

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.800
one cause was drought and

south well the w-h-o estimates pointed
 

00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:41.370
south well the w-h-o estimates pointed
out that something like 70 to 80 percent

from direct violence now there is a
 

00:22:57.080 --> 00:22:59.200
from direct violence now there is a
ground for legitimate debate and the

ground for legitimate debate and the
 

00:22:59.210 --> 00:23:01.780

of those who died of dysentery diarrhea

of those who died of dysentery diarrhea
 

00:23:05.210 --> 00:23:06.910
of those who died of dysentery diarrhea
would have survived if there was no

and I don't deny that that's an area of
 

00:23:12.410 --> 00:23:14.230
and I don't deny that that's an area of
legitimate debate but all I'm pointing

00:23:14.230 --> 00:23:14.240
legitimate debate but all I'm pointing
 

00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:16.000
legitimate debate but all I'm pointing
out is that there was not one cause of

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:16.010
out is that there was not one cause of
 

00:23:16.010 --> 00:23:18.730
out is that there was not one cause of
death there were multiple causes of

00:23:18.730 --> 00:23:18.740
death there were multiple causes of
 

00:23:18.740 --> 00:23:22.360
death there were multiple causes of
death there was a third factor which I

00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:22.370
death there was a third factor which I
 

00:23:22.370 --> 00:23:24.340
death there was a third factor which I

victims in the conflict that was 87 89
 

00:25:00.650 --> 00:25:04.540
victims in the conflict that was 87 89
now why did the 87 89 conflict happen

00:25:04.540 --> 00:25:04.550
now why did the 87 89 conflict happen
 

00:25:04.550 --> 00:25:08.030
now why did the 87 89 conflict happen
the 87 89 conflict happened for three

00:25:08.030 --> 00:25:08.040
the 87 89 conflict happened for three
 

00:25:08.040 --> 00:25:10.730
the 87 89 conflict happened for three
reasons the first reason was a

00:25:10.730 --> 00:25:10.740
reasons the first reason was a
 

00:25:10.740 --> 00:25:13.220
reasons the first reason was a
background reason which is the nature of

00:25:13.220 --> 00:25:13.230
background reason which is the nature of
 

00:25:13.230 --> 00:25:15.770
background reason which is the nature of
colonialism in Darfur the nature of

00:25:15.770 --> 00:25:15.780
colonialism in Darfur the nature of
 

00:25:15.780 --> 00:25:17.930
colonialism in Darfur the nature of
British colonialism when it got control

00:25:17.930 --> 00:25:17.940
British colonialism when it got control
 

00:25:17.940 --> 00:25:19.790
British colonialism when it got control
of Darfur it divided up the land

00:25:19.790 --> 00:25:19.800
of Darfur it divided up the land
 

00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:22.340
of Darfur it divided up the land
completely between different tribes so

00:25:22.340 --> 00:25:22.350
completely between different tribes so
 

00:25:22.350 --> 00:25:24.530
completely between different tribes so
therefore became a patchwork of tribal

00:25:24.530 --> 00:25:24.540
therefore became a patchwork of tribal
 

00:25:24.540 --> 00:25:28.370
therefore became a patchwork of tribal
homelands except that peasant tribes got

homelands except that peasant tribes got
 

00:25:28.380 --> 00:25:31.190

large homelands and the most nomadic
 

00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:33.830

tribes the camel tribes of the north got
 

00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:36.470

no homeland because they had no settled

year second cause was the drought and

00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:41.610
year second cause was the drought and

desertification as the Sahara expanded
 

00:25:44.070 --> 00:25:46.400
desertification as the Sahara expanded
it pushed the northern nomads down south

00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:46.410
it pushed the northern nomads down south
 

00:25:46.410 --> 00:25:48.320
it pushed the northern nomads down south
and they headed for the best land in

the third contributory cause was that

the third contributory cause was that
 

00:26:02.340 --> 00:26:05.690
the third contributory cause was that
