00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.104
Let's say that we want to solve the equation x squared plus 8 x plus 15 equals

00:00:04.104 --> 00:00:08.232
3. Well, we have two options. Our first option is to solve this graphically by

00:00:08.232 --> 00:00:12.487
plotting the intersection of two different curves. And our second option is to

00:00:12.487 --> 00:00:16.946
solve this purely algebraically. Let's start out with the first option. So, what

00:00:16.946 --> 00:00:21.490
two lines should be graph in order to solve this equation graphically? What two

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:24.105
lines do we want to intersect?
