00:00:00.399 --> 00:00:04.021
- [Voiceover] g is an exponential function

00:00:04.021 --> 00:00:07.248
with an initial value of -2.

00:00:07.248 --> 00:00:09.733
So, an initial value of -2,

00:00:09.733 --> 00:00:13.007
and a common ratio of 1/7,

00:00:13.007 --> 00:00:15.445
common ratio of 1/7.

00:00:15.445 --> 00:00:18.858
Write the formula for g(t).

00:00:18.858 --> 00:00:20.901
Well, the fact that it's
an exponential function,

00:00:20.901 --> 00:00:22.642
we know that its formula is going to be

00:00:22.642 --> 00:00:26.194
of the form g(t) is equal

00:00:26.194 --> 00:00:28.274
to our initial value

00:00:28.274 --> 00:00:29.910
which we could call A,

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.602
times our common ratio
which we could call r,

00:00:33.602 --> 00:00:35.320
to the t power.

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:36.574
It's going to have that form.

00:00:36.574 --> 00:00:38.060
And they tell us what
the initial value is.

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:39.708
It's -2.

00:00:39.708 --> 00:00:43.354
So this right over here is -2.

00:00:43.354 --> 00:00:46.372
And we know that the common ratio is 1/7.

00:00:46.372 --> 00:00:48.485
So this is 1/7.

00:00:48.485 --> 00:00:50.914
So let me just write it
again a little bit neater.

00:00:50.914 --> 00:00:53.844
g(t) is going to be equal to

00:00:53.844 --> 00:00:56.854
our initial value, -2,

00:00:56.854 --> 00:00:58.983
times

00:00:58.983 --> 00:01:03.883
times our common ratio, 1/7,

00:01:03.883 --> 00:01:06.842
to the t power.

00:01:06.842 --> 00:01:08.862
And hopefully this makes sense.

00:01:08.862 --> 00:01:10.812
Initial value is this number.

00:01:10.812 --> 00:01:12.647
Well, if t is equal to 0,

00:01:12.647 --> 00:01:15.015
then 1/7 to the zero power is 1.

00:01:15.015 --> 00:01:17.221
And so g(0), you could do that

00:01:17.221 --> 00:01:18.726
at time as being equal to zero

00:01:18.726 --> 00:01:21.257
if your t is time, would be equal to -2.

00:01:21.257 --> 00:01:23.021
So that would be our initial value.

00:01:23.021 --> 00:01:24.159
And then if you think about it, every time

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:25.854
you increase t by one,

00:01:25.854 --> 00:01:29.151
you're going to mulitply by 1/7 again.

00:01:29.151 --> 00:01:31.845
And so, the ratio between successive terms

00:01:31.845 --> 00:01:33.307
is going to be 1/7.

00:01:33.307 --> 00:01:34.488
And so that's why we call that

00:01:34.488 --> 00:01:36.613
the common ratio.

00:01:36.613 --> 00:01:39.080
Hopefully, you found that interesting.
