00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:05.580
At any point in time, we’re continuously
being encouraged to pick up some novel or

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:11.090
other. Reviews, the recommendations of friends
and the windows of bookstores edge us towards

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:16.650
certain titles that, we’re promised, will
definitively answer the deepest needs that

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:22.039
we bring to literature. Imagine that we have
picked up some such title. It’s late in

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:27.019
the evening and we’re just starting out,
our volume releasing the characteristic sweet

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:32.630
smell of newly opened work. The author is
going to great lengths to get us interested

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:37.270
in the life of someone living in Edinburgh
in the 1930s; it’s raining a lot and their

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:41.800
car breaks down; they’ve got a friend in
Budapest who is pregnant; there’s a robbery

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:46.130
at a department store. There’s a reference
to Dundas Street and we flick back thirty

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:50.660
pages and realise that’s where the main
character’s sister used to live. There’s

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:56.310
a retired engineer with very bushy eyebrows
who must be important in some way we don’t

00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:02.480
know yet. Immense effort and intelligence
are being devoted to exploring the existence

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:09.150
of a fictional individual. But at this point,
an incidental yet rather major thought strikes

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:15.820
us: no one, we realise, has ever looked at
our life – our habits, our friends, our

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:22.351
past, our dilemmas and problems – with such
sustained curiosity or in such detail. In

00:01:22.351 --> 00:01:28.000
the novel on our lap, there seem to be plenty
of pithy insights, clever summations, striking

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.230
observations and astute analyses, but all
for the sake of the workings of the mind of

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:40.010
someone else, who’s not really very much
like us. It’s a familiar situation we’ve

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:46.690
been educated politely to take for granted.
But now it hits us with particular force:

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:53.060
we’re reading the wrong book. What we should
really be doing is reading a book about us

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:59.571
– written with the same elegance and wisdom,
but placing the raw material of our life in

00:01:59.571 --> 00:02:05.620
a lucid order, selecting and joining up diverse
events in our chaotic stream of consciousness

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:12.000
and turning them into a coherent story. We’re
politely interested in the stories of others,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:18.550
but the story we really need to hear about
is our own. What we really crave is for someone

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:26.310
to make loving sense of us. We want them to
write us, with all our complexity and obscurity,

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:32.250
down in crisply phrased and clear sentences.
Our reading of someone else’s novel is dutiful

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.690
and well-educated no doubt, but it is as if
we went to the doctor and they made a very

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:43.030
accurate diagnosis of someone else’s earache,
or if a financial advisor went to great lengths

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:48.110
to present us with a solution to the money
troubles of a stranger, from which we could

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:54.020
at best extract the occasional fleeting hint
of what might possibly be useful in our own

00:02:54.020 --> 00:03:00.940
case. In the 1690s, one of the greatest of
French writers, François Fénelon, was appointed

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:06.430
tutor to the young Duke of Burgundy. To assist
with his education, Fénelon wrote a long

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:12.819
and fascinating novel called The Adventures
of Telemachus in which the Duke, lightly disguised,

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:17.850
was the central character. The problems the
character in the novel faces were exactly

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:22.569
the problems the Duke was actually facing;
the strengths and weakness of the central

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:28.379
character – carefully understood by the
writer – were his. It sounded like the rarest

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:34.690
and most cultivated luxury to have someone
write a novel about you. But it is a treat

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:41.930
we should all be granted – and perhaps secretly
crave. We don’t need to give up our jobs

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:47.060
and become writers – because this book of
ourselves is one we’re writing already;

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:53.180
we’re at work on it in the early hours,
when we can’t sleep, when we daydream, make

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:59.709
plans, go over the past – and give ourselves
over to retelling, as best we can, what has

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:05.541
really happened to us and what it all could
mean. It’s simply a pity we don’t devote

00:04:05.541 --> 00:04:13.080
as much energy as we should to this emerging,
critically important work. It is hugely noble

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:19.169
that we spend so much time reading the novels
of others. It is life-saving and properly

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:25.620
generous to ourselves when we learn to order
and make sense of the experiences of our own

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:32.159
troubled days and nights. There is no risk
in reading plenty of novels, but on a regular

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:39.940
basis, we should carve the time to write and
then read back to ourselves the nascent, unfolding novel of

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:42.800
the story of our own lives.
