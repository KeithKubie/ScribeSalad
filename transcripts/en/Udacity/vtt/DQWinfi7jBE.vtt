00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
There's another piece to URLs I'd like to show you--

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
and this is the final piece we'll talk about right now--

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
and that's called, the "port".

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
When you make a Web request to a Server, this is the host.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
This is the name of the machine

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
or the location of the machine you're requesting.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
In order to make an Internet connection, you need 2 things.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
You need: 1) the address of the machine, which is represented by the host

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
and 2) you also need a port.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
And, by default, the port equals 80.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
If you want to use a different port,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
you can include it in the URL

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
between the host and the path, separated by a colon.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
And in this case, we'll be making a request on port 8000.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Get used to this URL because this will be

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
your local development URL for a lot of this course--

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
and, actually, for a lot of your career as a Web developer.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
You're constantly accessing your local machine

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
and you're probably doing it on something other than port 80.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
There are even more parts to a URL,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
but they're not particularly relevant to us right now.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
They'll come up as we go.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Let's do one final quiz about URLs, before we move on.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
What I'd like you to do is take this URL

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
and identify its main parts:

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.857
host, protocol, fragment, query, and port.
