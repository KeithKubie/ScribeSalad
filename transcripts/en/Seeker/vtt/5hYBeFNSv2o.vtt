00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.410
We all know, if Marty travels back into the
past, and messes with it, he makes the Biff

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:05.410
timeline.

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:06.410
Casual.

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:07.410
We all get it.

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.790
Moral of the story: If you time travel and
mess with anything in the past, you automatically

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:14.840
mess with your future, but if Marty was a
quantum particle?

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:16.000
Maybe not so much.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.710
From what we commonly understand, time has
One Direction and that direction is forward;

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:23.360
past, present, future.

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:28.470
But physicists are playing with the theory
of “retrocausality”, which if real, is

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.250
the idea that the future can influence the
past.

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:36.120
That’s like if I spill coffee on my shirt
TOMORROW, but I will see the coffee stain

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.120
on my shirt today.

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.300
It’s kooky and is an idea that has been
around for a long time, but it never caught

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:41.989
on, because why would it??

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:46.999
We live on a cause-and-effect timeline and
the theory of retrocausality didn’t really

00:00:46.999 --> 00:00:48.899
fit, until recently.

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.260
Some physicists think accepting retrocausality
can answer a lot of unanswered questions in

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:57.960
quantum mechanics, and deepen our understanding
of “spooky action at a distance” .

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.190
“Spooky action” is what Einstein called
quantum entanglement back in the 1930’s.

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:07.470
He thought it was crazy that when two particles
are created at the same time, they can be

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.390
linked together, or entangled, even if they
are then separated light-years apart.

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.909
And according to quantum theory, elementary
particles like photons that are entangled,

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:23.439
have no definite state until they are measured
by us.

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:29.070
By measuring the spin of, say Particle A,
you automatically know the value of its entangled

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.130
partner, Particle B.

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:34.030
This is because Particle B is the opposite
of whatever Particle A was, even though we

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:38.350
didn’t actually know what Particle B was
before...and didn’t observe the two particles

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:40.409
exchange any signals when they were measured.

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:41.790
It’s spooky.

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.830
But some theorists are thinking that instead
of this just being a spooky occurrence, the

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:49.960
exchange of A and B’s spins are caused by
retrocausality.

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.520
The way some physicists see it, if time-symmetry
exists….

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.739
(the idea that time looks the same going backward
or forward without any issue in physics)

00:01:58.739 --> 00:02:03.640
… then retrocausality would allow Particle
B to go backwards in time.

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:08.470
When it does so, it takes the spin to the
moment it was created, and therefore affected

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:09.860
its entangled partner.

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:10.860
Right!?

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:11.860
I know.

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:13.120
Buuut how time flows is still up for debate.

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.680
The Second Law of Thermodynamics is thought
to drive time as we experience it -- the law

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:22.190
says says entropy must increase, making time
A-symmetrical.

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:25.610
And retrocausality would break that Law.

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.370
Buuut no one has proved time must be symmetrical,
or able to move either forward or backward,

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.230
and until that day happens retrocausality
isn’t going

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.190
So, we’re not time-traveling anytime soon,
the Laws of Thermodynamics are against us

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:40.940
and retrocausality is difficult to test because
we can’t witness it in our everyday lives.

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:44.820
People are working on theories around quantum
retrocausality, but it’s on the bleeding

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:47.560
edge of the discipline... it’s pretty out
there.

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:52.480
They believe if we can find evidence of retrocausality
in quantum states that would be huge.

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.650
If it does exist, we might be able to move
particles through a dimension of time…

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:58.350
Which would be like time travel.

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:02.350
And the first step to figuring it out, is
determining if it even exists in the first

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:03.350
place.

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:06.500
If physicists do figure it out, you know it’s
going to be a mind-melting explanation that

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:10.150
I am 100% ready to surrender my brain to.

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:39.920
Future me will hopefully come back to this
exact moment and tell us 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:45.220
all about it.

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:48.540
Future you chimed in and wants to let you
know you should subscribe for more videos

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.190
because you like them.

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:54.681
One last thing: Some cosmologists say there
are an infinite number of universes, with

00:03:54.681 --> 00:03:58.960
an infinite number of yous, and us….But
only one where we beat Thanos.

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:00.250
Thanks for watching
