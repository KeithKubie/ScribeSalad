00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.461
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:05.850
ADAM ROGERS: Hi.

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.250
Thank you for coming in,
forgoing the Google cafeteria

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:12.400
for a lunchtime--
nobody forewent it?

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.270
It didn't get foregone?

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:15.800
Thank you.

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.020
I appreciate it.

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:18.870
I want to do a little
calibration first.

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:24.510
How many of you are scientists,
computer or otherwise here?

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.180
How many of you are drinkers?

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:27.580
Any drinkers in the room.

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:28.756
It's my people, hi.

00:00:28.756 --> 00:00:29.256
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:29.256 --> 00:00:30.110
Good to see you.

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:32.810
I'm sure we've run into
each other in the bar.

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:35.480
So, we're going to be
talking about drinking

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.350
and talking about it with, I
hope, a little bit of context.

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:40.530
Other people have talked
about drinks before.

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.560
Someone else, for example, this
gentleman you recognize him,

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:44.470
any history people?

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:47.440
That's Ben Franklin.

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.950
He's quoted famously as
saying that wine is proof

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.930
that God loves us.

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:55.530
Which is actually
pretty profound,

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.290
because it gets at
the idea that there

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:04.250
is some kind of connection
between booze and the divine,

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.860
right?

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.570
Or I suppose between us
and divine, if you will.

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:10.354
Nothing, nobody cares
for the dumb puns?

00:01:10.354 --> 00:01:12.270
I would think that would
be-- all right, fine.

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.290
I'm going to do more of them,
so you have to get used to it.

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:15.280
That's a thing that's
going to happen

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:16.590
for the next few minutes.

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:17.760
That's actually misquote.

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:19.102
It's not what Franklin said.

00:01:19.102 --> 00:01:21.310
What Franklin actually said
was that the rain falling

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.720
on grapes, which then
are made into wine,

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.000
is a constant proof that
God loves us and wants

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.240
to see us happy.

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.040
And that's actually
even more potent.

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.790
Because it indicates
an intimate connection

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.730
with the process with nature.

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:40.960
And that's part of what
I want to argue today.

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.460
It's not my favorite booze quote
though, the Franklin quote.

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.184
My favorite one comes from
him, any English majors?

00:01:47.184 --> 00:01:48.800
AUDIENCE: Ogden Nash?

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:49.980
ADAM ROGERS: Close.

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:51.860
William Faulkner.

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:52.708
Not close at all.

00:01:52.708 --> 00:01:55.844
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:55.844 --> 00:01:57.510
I thought the Ogden
Nash was a car.

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:59.570
Wasn't that a Ford or something?

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:00.100
No.

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:05.630
Noted drinker, William
Faulkner, who said this,

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.949
"Civilization begins
with distillation."

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:11.622
And so we could be good high
school English students first

00:02:11.622 --> 00:02:13.330
and talk about the
metaphor there, right.

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.600
That civilization is about
boiling down and getting

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:16.720
to the essence of stuff.

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.100
And that's the etymology
of the word, sure.

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:22.600
It's the etymology
of the word yeast

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.960
too, interestingly,
not a coincidence.

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.620
But I want today to be
more literal about it.

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.500
I'm going to argue that the
human relationship with booze

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.584
is actually the story of how
Homo sapiens became people.

00:02:34.584 --> 00:02:36.000
It's the way that
we settled down.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.350
It's how we became civilized.

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:39.370
It's how we learned to
use what was happening

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:40.680
in our environment naturally.

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.138
And eventually, how we learned
to make something completely

00:02:43.138 --> 00:02:45.860
new, how we became
technological.

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:46.480
OK.

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.320
So, can I prove this?

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:50.290
Let me try.

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:51.880
We'll start here,
at the beginning.

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:56.330
That's yeast,
saccharomyces cerevisiae,

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:59.430
sugar-eating mushroom
that makes beer.

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.100
The name is a little
on the nose perhaps.

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:06.410
But what yeast
does, fundamentally,

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:10.965
is eats sugar and then excretes
carbon dioxide and ethanol,

00:03:10.965 --> 00:03:12.140
the alcohol that we drink.

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:16.160
Don't panic.

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:22.772
There's only one more that looks
like this in the whole deck.

00:03:22.772 --> 00:03:24.480
This is only interesting
for two reasons.

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.190
This is a yeast metabolism.

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:28.890
This is what made
sure that I was not

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:29.890
going to be a biologist.

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:31.934
This made sure that I
was going to be a writer.

00:03:31.934 --> 00:03:33.600
But two things I want
to point out here.

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:37.860
The green, the little green down
in the lower right, is energy.

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:42.710
ATP is the way a yeast
and you and I make energy.

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:45.840
And it's what we use for-- it's
the power source in our bodies.

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.730
So this is yeast taking in
glucose, up in the upper left,

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:49.640
turning it into ATP.

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:52.170
But then the box is
the interesting part.

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:55.640
Because the box is
yeast using an enzyme

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:58.910
called alcohol dehydrogenase
1 to turn something called

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:01.390
acetaldehyde into ethanol
and then excreting it.

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:05.520
But also using alcohol
dehydrogenase 2

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:09.900
to take that ethanol and
convert it back to acetaldehyde.

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:14.000
Basically, yeast eats its
own poop is the point.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.760
But that brings to rise
an important question.

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:21.130
Why does yeast make alcohol?

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:23.880
Not philosophically, it's not
like an existential question.

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:26.805
But evolutionarily, why
does yeast make alcohol?

00:04:26.805 --> 00:04:29.760
So there's two possibilities,
prompted by that little box.

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:32.800
One of them is that ethanol
is chemical warfare.

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:35.390
What do you do when you
want to clean out a cut?

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:36.370
Use alcohol.

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:38.310
Alcohol's really good
at killing microbes.

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:39.400
It's a microbicide.

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:44.009
So maybe yeast is using ethanol
to kill competitors locally.

00:04:44.009 --> 00:04:46.050
Yeast can tolerate really
high levels of ethanol.

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:46.980
Other microbes can't.

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:51.030
It makes its own
chemical weapon.

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:53.070
So that's what ADH
1 suggests, right?

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:57.100
Or ADH 2 says well, maybe
ethanol is just a food source.

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:01.680
It's storing away nuts for the
winter, in the microbial way,

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:02.460
right?

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:04.360
So which is it?

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:06.440
How do you figure that out?

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:09.432
That is what this
guy tried to do.

00:05:09.432 --> 00:05:11.140
This is a researcher
named Steven Benner.

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:13.137
He invented a field
called paleogenetics.

00:05:13.137 --> 00:05:14.803
Paleogenetics is a
little bit like-- you

00:05:14.803 --> 00:05:16.511
know how linguists
will try to figure out

00:05:16.511 --> 00:05:18.270
what the first word
for something was,

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:20.897
by looking at what the word
is in all different languages

00:05:20.897 --> 00:05:22.480
and finding what the
similarities are,

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:24.270
and trying to back trace it?

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:26.970
He figured out you could do
the same thing for enzymes.

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:29.350
That if you would take all
the samples of that enzyme

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:30.849
from a bunch of
different organisms,

00:05:30.849 --> 00:05:32.800
in this case
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:34.580
yeast and the
water-related species,

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:37.760
look at the various alcohol
dehydrogenase enzymes,

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:40.440
you could build, as he
did-- his team did--

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:45.550
12 different versions
of the primordial ADH,

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:46.980
what the first one looked like.

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:47.814
They called it adhA.

00:05:47.814 --> 00:05:49.896
They didn't know exactly
how it was going to work,

00:05:49.896 --> 00:05:51.360
so they had 12
different versions.

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:54.126
And what they wanted to
do was run the equation.

00:05:54.126 --> 00:05:55.500
Let it run, look
at the kinetics,

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:56.640
and see what it wanted to do.

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:58.514
Did it want to make
acetaldehyde into ethanol

00:05:58.514 --> 00:06:01.190
or make ethanol
into acetaldehyde.

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:02.630
So they did it.

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:03.670
And what happened?

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:05.800
Turned out adhA was a
lot more like the one

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:07.860
that made the ethanol.

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:09.520
Yeast wants to make ethanol.

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:10.830
So problem solved.

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:13.310
Chemical weapon, right?

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:14.310
No, of course not.

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:16.180
It's not that easy.

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:18.590
I said that yeast eats sugar.

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:20.840
150 million years ago,
when yeast are first

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:22.484
figuring this out,
where's the sugar?

00:06:22.484 --> 00:06:24.400
Sugar cane hasn't evolved
yet, because grasses

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:25.233
haven't evolved yet.

00:06:25.233 --> 00:06:26.790
Sugar cane is a grass.

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:31.930
Well, plants, where yeasts
live, were mostly conifers.

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:34.610
They were like pine trees,
like on the right there.

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:38.657
No, my right.

00:06:38.657 --> 00:06:40.990
Yeast probably lived exposed
to the air on these things,

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:44.210
on tree sap exudates,
on little blurbs of sap.

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:45.730
Like when you come
near a pine tree

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:47.102
and you get sap on your hand.

00:06:47.102 --> 00:06:48.310
That's where the yeast lived.

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:49.998
And so, because
ethanol is volatile,

00:06:49.998 --> 00:06:51.414
it wants to
evaporate-- and that's

00:06:51.414 --> 00:06:54.350
going to be important later
as a property-- that's

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:57.040
a really good property to
have in a waste product.

00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:58.950
That's perfect sewage.

00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:00.760
Have ethanol, and
then it evaporates.

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:03.594
But then about 100 million
years later-- sorry,

00:07:03.594 --> 00:07:05.760
about 50 million years
later, 100 million years ago,

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:08.310
in the Cretaceous
period, the fruity plants

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:10.920
take over from the pine trees,
the fruiting flowering plants.

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:12.820
Those are the angiosperms.

00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:14.300
The other plant
there is amborella,

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:15.870
it's the very first angiosperm.

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:20.324
And yeast now are pre-adapted to
live inside those fruits, where

00:07:20.324 --> 00:07:22.240
all the simple sugar is
that they want to eat,

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:24.420
because they can tolerate
higher level levels of ethanol.

00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:25.794
They're making
their own ethanol,

00:07:25.794 --> 00:07:27.860
and they can hang out
inside that fruit.

00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:30.630
So they look pre-evolved,
they look ready.

00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:33.160
What it actually is
is a coincidence.

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:35.570
But because they're
adapted to do that,

00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:37.409
they have the luck
to do what needs

00:07:37.409 --> 00:07:38.700
to be done in a changing world.

00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:41.610
Because the other animals that
couldn't handle the change

00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:44.560
to angiosperms, to flowering
fruiting plants, went extinct.

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:47.960
It was an extinction level
event for like-- well, let's

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:48.970
put it this way.

00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:50.650
The dinosaurs that
figured out how

00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:53.250
to deal with fruiting
flowering plants are birds.

00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:59.390
The point I want to make
about this mostly-- other

00:07:59.390 --> 00:08:02.490
than I just kind of think
it's a cool set of deductions

00:08:02.490 --> 00:08:05.120
from the lab-- is
that fermentation

00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:07.990
happens without us.

00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:08.950
It doesn't need us.

00:08:08.950 --> 00:08:12.124
If yeast makes
ethanol in the forest,

00:08:12.124 --> 00:08:14.040
does anyone get drunk
to hear it or something.

00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:16.676
Right, like if nobody's
there, it still happens.

00:08:16.676 --> 00:08:17.800
There's still fermentation.

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:18.364
It occurs.

00:08:18.364 --> 00:08:20.280
It occurred for millions
and millions of years

00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:23.640
before human beings
came on the scene.

00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:25.790
But then we did.

00:08:25.790 --> 00:08:30.010
So this is a shard
of a pot that's

00:08:30.010 --> 00:08:33.860
9,000 or 10,000 years old,
found in an archaeological site

00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:34.980
in China called Jiahu.

00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:36.760
Jiahu's a really
interesting site.

00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:40.270
It's one of the places where the
first instances of rice being

00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:41.864
consumed by human
beings was found.

00:08:41.864 --> 00:08:43.280
It's one of the
first places where

00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:44.904
there was evidence
of written language.

00:08:44.904 --> 00:08:46.880
It's one of the
oldest places where

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:48.400
they found musical instruments.

00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:52.620
It's one of the places where
civilization began, where

00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:56.550
all of the things that we
think make us civilized people

00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:57.954
happened first.

00:08:57.954 --> 00:08:59.370
Well, one of the
things they found

00:08:59.370 --> 00:09:01.950
was this pot with some
weird residue inside.

00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:04.260
You can guess, probably
it's not a spoiler to say,

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:05.600
what that residue's going to be.

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:07.475
But they didn't know
what it was at the time.

00:09:07.475 --> 00:09:09.770
So, the researchers who
were working the site

00:09:09.770 --> 00:09:13.220
sent for this analytical
chemist, a guy named Patrick

00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:15.616
McGovern, he works at the
University of Pennsylvania.

00:09:15.616 --> 00:09:17.490
He ran a bunch of tests--
gas chromatography,

00:09:17.490 --> 00:09:19.910
mass spectroscopy, Feigl spot
test, he shot lasers at it.

00:09:19.910 --> 00:09:21.284
He you did all
the cool stuff you

00:09:21.284 --> 00:09:25.110
can do if you have a lab at
Penn and found three things.

00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:28.170
Not ethanol, I mentioned
ethanol's volatile.

00:09:28.170 --> 00:09:28.980
Ethanol evaporates.

00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:31.590
So even in the oldest samples,
even in the ones like the Roman

00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:33.590
amphoras that they know
were used to carry wine,

00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:34.881
they almost never find ethanol.

00:09:34.881 --> 00:09:36.050
They find other stuff.

00:09:36.050 --> 00:09:38.300
What he found was three things.

00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:42.780
Beeswax, which you only
find if there's honey.

00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:44.910
Rice, he found traces of rice.

00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:47.310
And tartrates-- tartaric acid.

00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:48.950
From anywhere else
at any other time

00:09:48.950 --> 00:09:52.150
that would probably
have meant grapes.

00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:53.936
But not in China,
not 10,000 years ago.

00:09:53.936 --> 00:09:55.560
They had grapes, they
had wild species,

00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:57.450
but they weren't common.

00:09:57.450 --> 00:09:59.620
McGovern thinks it
was probably hawthorn,

00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:01.660
which he says is
like a chalky apple.

00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:04.080
It's a fruit that
has sugar in it.

00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:06.959
Now if you mix all that stuff
together and ground it up

00:10:06.959 --> 00:10:09.000
and let it sit, you'd have
a hard time keeping it

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:10.850
from fermenting.

00:10:10.850 --> 00:10:13.275
The wild yeast, the
ambient yeast in the air,

00:10:13.275 --> 00:10:14.150
would grab onto that.

00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:15.080
There's a lot of sugar in there.

00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:16.663
They would want to
make it into booze.

00:10:16.663 --> 00:10:21.580
What McGovern had found was
the mother Eve of booze.

00:10:21.580 --> 00:10:23.490
Honey makes mead,
rice make sake,

00:10:23.490 --> 00:10:26.020
fruit makes wine and brandy.

00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:28.830
It's the oldest-- the evidence
that he found on this shard,

00:10:28.830 --> 00:10:31.315
it's the oldest example of
human controlled fermentation

00:10:31.315 --> 00:10:32.520
that anybody's ever found.

00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:33.700
10,000 years.

00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:35.490
I've held this.

00:10:35.490 --> 00:10:40.110
It's in his office, it's sitting
in a Ziploc on his shelf.

00:10:40.110 --> 00:10:42.790
And I asked to hold it,
and he put on gloves,

00:10:42.790 --> 00:10:44.790
he made me put on gloves,
he opened the thing.

00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:45.873
I mean, it was a big deal.

00:10:45.873 --> 00:10:46.800
But it was a big deal.

00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:49.090
It's the oldest
thing I've ever held.

00:10:49.090 --> 00:10:54.050
And it did give the sense
of a profound connection

00:10:54.050 --> 00:10:57.076
to the first home brewer, right?

00:10:57.076 --> 00:10:59.200
Whatever the ritual was,
whatever the ceremony was,

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:00.283
this is where it happened.

00:11:00.283 --> 00:11:01.990
This thing.

00:11:01.990 --> 00:11:03.000
10,000 years.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.890
That's how long we've
been at it, at least.

00:11:05.890 --> 00:11:08.740
Taming this natural
process, domesticating it,

00:11:08.740 --> 00:11:11.900
domesticating yeast, while the
yeast domesticated us, right?

00:11:11.900 --> 00:11:13.610
Please give me more sugar.

00:11:13.610 --> 00:11:15.830
I will roll over with my
belly up and wag my tail

00:11:15.830 --> 00:11:17.330
if you will just
give me more sugar.

00:11:19.690 --> 00:11:21.070
That's the key.

00:11:21.070 --> 00:11:23.660
Here's the only other slide.

00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:26.900
Does anybody recognize this?

00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:27.760
It's sugar, yeah.

00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:29.130
It's glucose, exactly.

00:11:29.130 --> 00:11:30.520
Simplest of simple sugars.

00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:33.140
Six carbons in a
hexagon, some hydrogens

00:11:33.140 --> 00:11:35.880
and oxygens dangling
off the corners.

00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:38.770
This is the most important
molecule on earth.

00:11:38.770 --> 00:11:41.150
Not water, water's
medium, not message.

00:11:41.150 --> 00:11:42.050
This is message.

00:11:42.050 --> 00:11:43.530
Sugar's power.

00:11:43.530 --> 00:11:45.840
Just about every
form of life on Earth

00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:47.990
uses the energy stored
in all those chemical

00:11:47.990 --> 00:11:52.100
bonds and the lines
to stay alive.

00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:55.230
Sugar's structure-- you get
variations in molecules,

00:11:55.230 --> 00:11:57.160
you get different
kinds of sugars.

00:11:57.160 --> 00:11:58.870
You can attach them together
in a bunch of different ways.

00:11:58.870 --> 00:12:01.160
And instead of having a
monosaccharide, a single sugar,

00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:02.140
you can have
polysaccharides, you

00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:03.660
can have bigger
and bigger sugars.

00:12:06.169 --> 00:12:08.710
Connect these glucose molecules
together in one specific way,

00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:09.800
and you get cellulose.

00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:14.210
The most common organic molecule
on earth-- wood, paper, right?

00:12:14.210 --> 00:12:16.310
It's just repeating
elements of that.

00:12:16.310 --> 00:12:17.710
That's the sub-unit.

00:12:17.710 --> 00:12:20.235
Connect that same molecule
in a different way,

00:12:20.235 --> 00:12:22.360
and you get the starches--
amylose and amylopectin.

00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:28.280
Sugar is literally--
this is just an aside,

00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:29.690
I'm going to do that a
lot-- sugar is literally

00:12:29.690 --> 00:12:31.190
the backbone of our genes.

00:12:31.190 --> 00:12:32.650
Deoxyribonucleic acid?

00:12:32.650 --> 00:12:33.845
The ribo in there is ribose.

00:12:33.845 --> 00:12:35.140
It's a sugar.

00:12:35.140 --> 00:12:36.850
We're made of this.

00:12:36.850 --> 00:12:38.100
It's our storage medium.

00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:39.490
So that's all neat, right?

00:12:39.490 --> 00:12:40.340
That's cool.

00:12:40.340 --> 00:12:43.470
And like I said, yeast
eat simple sugars-- mono

00:12:43.470 --> 00:12:46.690
and disaccharides primarily
excrete carbon dioxide,

00:12:46.690 --> 00:12:47.260
make ethanol.

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:52.260
So that's all fine, if you
have a source of simple sugar.

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:54.870
Apples have a lot of
those simple sugars.

00:12:54.870 --> 00:12:56.630
Honey, tons, right?

00:12:56.630 --> 00:12:59.380
Put honey out in water and
you automatically get mead.

00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:02.146
Grapes, grapes are
awesome, 25% simple sugar.

00:13:02.146 --> 00:13:04.020
Every single varietal
of wine you've ever had

00:13:04.020 --> 00:13:05.220
is one grape species.

00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:07.545
Vitis vinifera, lucky
enough to survive an ice age

00:13:07.545 --> 00:13:09.670
and show up in the Fertile
Crescent, Transcaucasian

00:13:09.670 --> 00:13:12.060
Mountain area, just about
when people wanted to plant

00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:13.600
stuff and make booze.

00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:17.770
One researcher told me if human
beings had evolved on a Pacific

00:13:17.770 --> 00:13:20.000
island or had started
cities on Pacific Islands

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.507
instead of in the
Transcaucasian Mountains,

00:13:22.507 --> 00:13:24.840
then we'd have hundreds of
different species of coconut.

00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:26.930
And grape would be a rare thing
that you found in Whole Foods

00:13:26.930 --> 00:13:27.596
once in a while.

00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:31.680
So that's all fine.

00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:35.180
But what if your most easily
accessible agricultural product

00:13:35.180 --> 00:13:37.950
stores its sugar as starch?

00:13:37.950 --> 00:13:39.590
Because here's the problem.

00:13:39.590 --> 00:13:43.610
You know how we in the room--
unless one of you is a mutant--

00:13:43.610 --> 00:13:46.177
cannot digest cellulose.

00:13:46.177 --> 00:13:47.510
We just don't know how to do it.

00:13:47.510 --> 00:13:48.620
But we can digest starch.

00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:50.060
There's an enzyme in
our saliva that does.

00:13:50.060 --> 00:13:51.476
There's an amylase,
an enzyme that

00:13:51.476 --> 00:13:54.000
digests starch, in our saliva
that begins that process.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.330
Yeast can't do either
of those things.

00:13:57.330 --> 00:14:00.265
So if it's grain or rice
or corn, this of barley,

00:14:00.265 --> 00:14:03.090
it just stores all
that sugar as starch.

00:14:03.090 --> 00:14:05.180
What do you do?

00:14:05.180 --> 00:14:06.860
Grains are fascinating.

00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:08.650
They're basically
little life bombs.

00:14:08.650 --> 00:14:10.510
There's an a plant
embryo in there

00:14:10.510 --> 00:14:16.170
and then starch to store fuel,
like a yolk in an animal egg.

00:14:16.170 --> 00:14:18.650
That's what that starch is.

00:14:18.650 --> 00:14:21.760
When it's time to grow, the
seeds-- the barley corns

00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:23.970
or the grains--
make enzymes that

00:14:23.970 --> 00:14:26.060
convert that starch into sugar.

00:14:26.060 --> 00:14:28.020
The amylases that break it down.

00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:32.780
And why would you
want to do that?

00:14:32.780 --> 00:14:34.950
Fermenting and distilling
eventually are like value adds,

00:14:34.950 --> 00:14:35.790
basically, right?

00:14:35.790 --> 00:14:37.710
You have a whole field
full of that stuff,

00:14:37.710 --> 00:14:39.310
it's hard to get it to market.

00:14:39.310 --> 00:14:40.816
But if you take
that whole field,

00:14:40.816 --> 00:14:42.440
and you turn into a
barrel of something

00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:44.023
that you can actually
charge more for,

00:14:44.023 --> 00:14:45.719
it's easier to
get to the market.

00:14:45.719 --> 00:14:47.260
People want to pay
more money for it.

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:48.950
It's a value add.

00:14:48.950 --> 00:14:52.160
So the way that we
do that in the West

00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:55.630
is with a process called
malting, like single malt

00:14:55.630 --> 00:14:56.810
scotch.

00:14:56.810 --> 00:14:59.990
And malting basically is--
this is Glen Ord Malting,

00:14:59.990 --> 00:15:00.910
it's owned by Diageo.

00:15:00.910 --> 00:15:01.700
It's in the north of Scotland.

00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:03.760
Diageo is a big
transnational drinks company.

00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:07.930
They do almost 84 million pounds
of barley into malt a year.

00:15:07.930 --> 00:15:10.470
It's like seven trucks a
day, every day of the year.

00:15:10.470 --> 00:15:11.980
It only takes about 11
people to run the plant.

00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:13.896
But basically what they're
doing in this place

00:15:13.896 --> 00:15:17.110
is tricking barley into
thinking that it's growing.

00:15:17.110 --> 00:15:18.300
They let it germinate.

00:15:18.300 --> 00:15:19.940
It grows a little bit.

00:15:19.940 --> 00:15:22.302
It starts the biochemical
processes going and making

00:15:22.302 --> 00:15:24.510
those enzymes, converting
those starches into sugars.

00:15:24.510 --> 00:15:25.680
And then they
arrest the process.

00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:27.660
They stop it, so they have
access to the enzymes.

00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:29.120
And then you can mix it
in with other grains.

00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:30.830
And you can make beer out of it.

00:15:30.830 --> 00:15:32.837
Distill beer and you get whisky.

00:15:32.837 --> 00:15:35.420
Basically, anything that we make
that's fermented or distilled

00:15:35.420 --> 00:15:38.310
in the West, starts
with malt or the enzymes

00:15:38.310 --> 00:15:41.570
that you can extract
from the malting process.

00:15:41.570 --> 00:15:46.260
That's fine, but what if
you were working with rice?

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:51.310
So if you're making sake or
rice wine, like in Japan,

00:15:51.310 --> 00:15:53.670
they don't use malting.

00:15:53.670 --> 00:15:56.890
They actually polish away all
of the rice bran, the thing that

00:15:56.890 --> 00:15:59.660
makes rice brown, those are the
layers that make those enzymes.

00:15:59.660 --> 00:16:02.320
What they do is they infect
the rice with another fungus--

00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:04.890
yeast is a fungus.

00:16:04.890 --> 00:16:06.642
The fungus is called koji.

00:16:06.642 --> 00:16:08.772
Have you heard of this?

00:16:08.772 --> 00:16:10.730
Some of the sake fans
probably know about koji.

00:16:10.730 --> 00:16:12.870
Koji is a fungus.

00:16:12.870 --> 00:16:14.354
It makes proteases and amylases.

00:16:14.354 --> 00:16:16.270
It breaks down proteins,
breaks down starches.

00:16:16.270 --> 00:16:19.590
It's the basis for
almost every Asian food.

00:16:19.590 --> 00:16:25.270
It's how they make tofu
and vinegar and sake.

00:16:25.270 --> 00:16:26.622
It's an Aspergillus oryzae.

00:16:26.622 --> 00:16:28.330
And so if you know
anything about plants,

00:16:28.330 --> 00:16:30.788
that would make you nervous
because most of the Aspergillus

00:16:30.788 --> 00:16:32.910
species are total bastards.

00:16:32.910 --> 00:16:35.844
They make aflatoxins,
they're carcinogenic.

00:16:35.844 --> 00:16:37.510
The clinical literature
includes phrases

00:16:37.510 --> 00:16:40.650
like, "bloody ball of
mucus in the lungs."

00:16:40.650 --> 00:16:42.400
They're horrifying.

00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:43.334
But not koji.

00:16:43.334 --> 00:16:45.250
Koji has all the genes
that do all that stuff,

00:16:45.250 --> 00:16:46.180
but they're all turned off.

00:16:46.180 --> 00:16:48.013
It's domesticated, it's
another tame fungus.

00:16:48.013 --> 00:16:51.140
We tamed it to do
one thing-- make

00:16:51.140 --> 00:16:53.160
rice sugary so yeast can eat it.

00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:55.150
Been around since 300 BC.

00:16:55.150 --> 00:16:56.770
All right, so
fascinating process.

00:16:56.770 --> 00:17:00.100
So interesting in fact, that
this guy, Jokichi Takamine,

00:17:00.100 --> 00:17:02.290
who's a chemist born
in 1854, thought

00:17:02.290 --> 00:17:05.119
that he could commercialize
it to not just saccharify--

00:17:05.119 --> 00:17:07.174
the process of turning
starch into sugar

00:17:07.174 --> 00:17:10.524
is called saccharification--
not just to saccharify rice,

00:17:10.524 --> 00:17:12.300
but barley too.

00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:14.290
And this was an incredible
insight on his part.

00:17:14.290 --> 00:17:16.980
Because in the late 1880s,
researchers like the Buchner

00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:19.579
brothers were still trying to
figure out what enzymes were.

00:17:19.579 --> 00:17:22.670
People had just really agreed
that yeast were the things that

00:17:22.670 --> 00:17:24.990
did fermentation
about 20 years before.

00:17:24.990 --> 00:17:28.730
That was the discovery that
put Louis Pasteur on the map,

00:17:28.730 --> 00:17:29.580
saying, yeah, no.

00:17:29.580 --> 00:17:32.132
I'm pretty sure it's
the yeast, you guys.

00:17:32.132 --> 00:17:32.840
Think about that.

00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:36.840
10,000 years of
using the process,

00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:39.960
of making fermented and
distilled stuff, and nobody

00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:45.130
knew what was doing it
until the 1860s, 1870s.

00:17:45.130 --> 00:17:48.310
And nobody knew how it
worked until much later.

00:17:48.310 --> 00:17:52.150
It's the beginning of
biochemistry, this realization.

00:17:52.150 --> 00:17:53.100
Fermentation.

00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:56.330
Yeast converting
sugar to ethanol.

00:17:56.330 --> 00:17:58.820
Takamine thought that he
could convert that process

00:17:58.820 --> 00:18:00.130
and commercialize it.

00:18:00.130 --> 00:18:03.690
And he actually figured out
how to grow koji on rice bran--

00:18:03.690 --> 00:18:06.497
a throwaway product the
sake makers didn't want.

00:18:06.497 --> 00:18:08.580
It was cheaper, it would
actually make more sugar.

00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:10.960
And if you're a big distiller,
sugar is actually money.

00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:13.418
You want more sugar because
you get more ethanol out of it.

00:18:13.418 --> 00:18:15.980
He was hired by the
Whiskey Trust-- which

00:18:15.980 --> 00:18:19.145
before prohibition was the
largest distiller in the world,

00:18:19.145 --> 00:18:21.020
it was the American
distilling conglomerate--

00:18:21.020 --> 00:18:22.980
to come to the US,
build the facility,

00:18:22.980 --> 00:18:25.140
and try to commercialize
that process here,

00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:28.030
to make whiskey without malt.

00:18:28.030 --> 00:18:30.410
Zero malt scotch,
instead of single malt.

00:18:34.357 --> 00:18:36.940
His English language biographer
is a woman named Joan Bennett.

00:18:36.940 --> 00:18:38.606
And she points out
he came pretty close,

00:18:38.606 --> 00:18:43.550
they actually sold a product for
a while called Banzai, again,

00:18:43.550 --> 00:18:45.690
a little bit on the nose.

00:18:45.690 --> 00:18:47.096
But things didn't work out.

00:18:47.096 --> 00:18:48.470
One of his facilities
burned down

00:18:48.470 --> 00:18:49.750
under mysterious
circumstances, you

00:18:49.750 --> 00:18:51.625
can imagine the people
who made malt were not

00:18:51.625 --> 00:18:53.980
so happy about this idea.

00:18:53.980 --> 00:18:55.880
And the relationship
with the Whiskey Trust

00:18:55.880 --> 00:18:58.090
fell apart, it didn't work out.

00:18:58.090 --> 00:19:02.040
But so we still today
have this process where

00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:06.212
we malt to make
whiskey and make beer.

00:19:06.212 --> 00:19:07.920
I don't want you to
feel too bad for him.

00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:09.710
He took his process
and turned it

00:19:09.710 --> 00:19:13.526
into what Joan Bennett calls
the Alka Seltzer the 1890s,

00:19:13.526 --> 00:19:14.900
this stuff, pocket
Taka-Diastase.

00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:16.410
And he got so rich
that Parke Davis,

00:19:16.410 --> 00:19:18.160
the pharmaceutical
company, bought it out.

00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:21.134
Oh, I should say one thing
that made Takamine unique was

00:19:21.134 --> 00:19:22.800
that unlike most
scientists of the time,

00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:25.980
he didn't mind
patenting his processes.

00:19:25.980 --> 00:19:28.120
So the process for
making that koji stuff

00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:31.190
was the first English
language biotechnology patent,

00:19:31.190 --> 00:19:33.280
depending on how you
count that kind of stuff.

00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:36.940
Eventually Parke Davis bought
the copyright on this stuff

00:19:36.940 --> 00:19:38.100
and set him up in a lab.

00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:39.490
They wanted him
to figure out how

00:19:39.490 --> 00:19:42.500
to isolate another strange and
wondrous chemical that nobody

00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:43.685
knew how it worked.

00:19:43.685 --> 00:19:45.560
At the time they were
calling it epinephrine.

00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:48.610
He figured out the process
and named it adrenalin.

00:19:48.610 --> 00:19:51.560
And he patented that too, which
led to a bunch of lawsuits,

00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:53.480
because they made so much money.

00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:57.624
Eventually, a judge named
Learned Hand in 1911 said,

00:19:57.624 --> 00:19:59.290
you guys got to leave
Parke Davis alone.

00:19:59.290 --> 00:20:03.446
It is in fact legal to patent
a naturally occurring product.

00:20:03.446 --> 00:20:04.320
This is the decision.

00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:08.090
This is the basis for the
modern biotechnology industry,

00:20:08.090 --> 00:20:09.470
because of koji.

00:20:09.470 --> 00:20:12.420
Because of the failure
of koji, really.

00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:13.670
Takamine got so rich.

00:20:13.670 --> 00:20:15.851
He moved to New York, he
had a beautiful mansion.

00:20:15.851 --> 00:20:18.100
He was kind of an unofficial
technological ambassador.

00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:20.350
And eventually it was his
money that paid for these.

00:20:20.350 --> 00:20:22.225
These are the cherry
trees in Washington, DC.

00:20:22.225 --> 00:20:27.160
He's the guy who bought
these, the 2,000 cherry trees.

00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:32.650
All right, so I'm going
to jump from here back

00:20:32.650 --> 00:20:39.350
about 2,000 years to this
place, Ancient Alexandria.

00:20:39.350 --> 00:20:41.055
You know Alexandria,
the library.

00:20:44.170 --> 00:20:48.580
All that Caesar, Mark
Antony, Cleopatra drama.

00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:49.880
The lighthouse.

00:20:49.880 --> 00:20:54.110
Founded by Alexander the Great,
it's the first modern city.

00:20:54.110 --> 00:20:55.630
It's built on a
gridiron, designed

00:20:55.630 --> 00:20:57.480
to take advantage of prevailing
winds off the desert.

00:20:57.480 --> 00:20:59.438
It has a beautiful
lighthouse, it has plumbing,

00:20:59.438 --> 00:21:01.920
it has the library
that I mentioned.

00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:04.290
It has automatons,
they loved automatons.

00:21:04.290 --> 00:21:07.530
They had steam engines and if
you would open a temple door,

00:21:07.530 --> 00:21:09.510
and then the robot
god in the back

00:21:09.510 --> 00:21:11.340
would move and
catch the sunlight,

00:21:11.340 --> 00:21:15.440
you could put a coin into
a slot and a robot bird

00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:18.140
would sing a song, and the
temple fire would light up.

00:21:18.140 --> 00:21:19.390
They loved that kind of stuff.

00:21:19.390 --> 00:21:20.630
They had parades for it.

00:21:20.630 --> 00:21:22.480
This is a city of engineers.

00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:23.396
They're technologists.

00:21:26.190 --> 00:21:28.164
And more than that though,
they're alchemists.

00:21:28.164 --> 00:21:30.330
One of the things that the
labs there are working on

00:21:30.330 --> 00:21:31.120
is alchemy.

00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:33.010
Now alchemy gets kind
of-- in my opinion--

00:21:33.010 --> 00:21:33.820
it gets kind of a raw deal.

00:21:33.820 --> 00:21:35.430
Because what we know
about alchemy is like, oh,

00:21:35.430 --> 00:21:36.780
they were trying to
convert lead into gold.

00:21:36.780 --> 00:21:38.690
It's the Middle Ages,
they're con artists

00:21:38.690 --> 00:21:40.750
looking for eternal
life, Harry Potter stuff.

00:21:40.750 --> 00:21:41.800
Fine.

00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:44.750
Philosophically, they were
wrong about almost everything.

00:21:44.750 --> 00:21:46.380
But methodologically
they weren't.

00:21:46.380 --> 00:21:49.340
What they were doing was
inventing the infrastructure

00:21:49.340 --> 00:21:50.780
for modern science.

00:21:50.780 --> 00:21:55.550
Critically coming up with a lab
and experimentation on nature

00:21:55.550 --> 00:21:57.210
and the stuff in that lab.

00:21:57.210 --> 00:22:01.840
So one of the most famous
of them is this woman.

00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:04.700
This is Maria the Jewess.

00:22:04.700 --> 00:22:08.192
We only know mostly-- I
know, I didn't name her.

00:22:08.192 --> 00:22:09.044
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:09.044 --> 00:22:11.130
We know about her mostly
from a biographer who

00:22:11.130 --> 00:22:14.612
wrote about her much later,
named Zosimos the Panopolitan.

00:22:14.612 --> 00:22:16.580
Gotta get a "the" in my name.

00:22:16.580 --> 00:22:17.440
Right?

00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:19.787
How awesome would that be?

00:22:19.787 --> 00:22:21.620
And he never really
said when she was alive,

00:22:21.620 --> 00:22:25.265
but people think roughly the
turn of the first millennium.

00:22:25.265 --> 00:22:28.380
Do you know what a bain-marie
is or a marienbad in a lab?

00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:31.120
A laboratory double-boiler?

00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:32.552
She invented that.

00:22:32.552 --> 00:22:34.382
It's ascribed to her.

00:22:34.382 --> 00:22:36.340
It's not the only piece
of laboratory equipment

00:22:36.340 --> 00:22:36.990
she invented.

00:22:36.990 --> 00:22:40.080
She also came up with this.

00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:44.180
The one on the left is called a
kerotakis, the one on the right

00:22:44.180 --> 00:22:45.480
is a tribikos.

00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:48.727
Forgive my ancient Greek,
my pronunciation's terrible.

00:22:48.727 --> 00:22:50.810
In Arabic you would call
these things put together

00:22:50.810 --> 00:22:53.500
an al-anbiq or an alembic.

00:22:53.500 --> 00:22:55.370
This is a still.

00:22:55.370 --> 00:22:57.150
She came up with it.

00:22:57.150 --> 00:22:59.879
She wanted to heat stuff
and separate it out.

00:22:59.879 --> 00:23:01.420
There's some
disagreement about this.

00:23:01.420 --> 00:23:04.040
The still could have been
first invented in China.

00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:08.010
But the way I want you
to think about a still

00:23:08.010 --> 00:23:10.334
is as a separation
technology, high technology

00:23:10.334 --> 00:23:11.250
for separating things.

00:23:11.250 --> 00:23:12.416
So how do we separate stuff?

00:23:12.416 --> 00:23:14.547
Filtration, you
separate things by size.

00:23:14.547 --> 00:23:16.630
Centrifugation, you're
separating things by weight

00:23:16.630 --> 00:23:17.100
essentially.

00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:18.850
You increase gravity
and the heavier stuff

00:23:18.850 --> 00:23:20.220
falls to the bottom.

00:23:20.220 --> 00:23:22.300
Modern practices, gas
chromatography or gel

00:23:22.300 --> 00:23:25.750
electrophoresis, you separate
things by electrical charge.

00:23:25.750 --> 00:23:27.320
What a still does
is separate things

00:23:27.320 --> 00:23:30.470
based on evaporation
pressure, based on volatility.

00:23:30.470 --> 00:23:33.280
More volatile stuff-- things
that evaporate easily--

00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:34.480
go over the top first.

00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:37.050
Things that evaporate with
more energy, go over later.

00:23:37.050 --> 00:23:38.899
And you can separate things out.

00:23:38.899 --> 00:23:40.940
You can get rid of things
you don't want and keep

00:23:40.940 --> 00:23:43.167
the things you do,
like ethanol and water.

00:23:43.167 --> 00:23:45.500
Different molecules evaporate
at different temperatures.

00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:47.265
Now what--

00:23:47.265 --> 00:23:48.140
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:23:48.140 --> 00:23:49.070
ADAM ROGERS: --No,
its fine, I'll stop.

00:23:49.070 --> 00:23:50.070
Whatever, it's cool.

00:23:50.070 --> 00:23:54.700
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:54.700 --> 00:23:58.847
Probably what Maria was trying
to do did not involve booze.

00:23:58.847 --> 00:24:00.680
They had access to Roman
wine in Alexandria,

00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:02.800
but she was probably putting
in stuff like sulfur.

00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:06.850
The alchemists were
interested in the spirits

00:24:06.850 --> 00:24:08.700
in inanimate objects,
right, that's

00:24:08.700 --> 00:24:10.619
where we get that word too.

00:24:10.619 --> 00:24:13.160
So she was putting in metals
and liquids and stuff like that.

00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:14.800
She did figure out you
need to use copper,

00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:15.930
and you need to use solder.

00:24:15.930 --> 00:24:17.460
And you need to keep
the heat insulated

00:24:17.460 --> 00:24:18.918
and keep the heat
from getting out,

00:24:18.918 --> 00:24:20.530
all the basic tenets
of distilling.

00:24:20.530 --> 00:24:23.130
Nobody really knows if anybody
ever put that wine in the still

00:24:23.130 --> 00:24:24.000
to see what would happen.

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:26.280
I like to think of her lab as
being like a graduate student

00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:26.710
lab though.

00:24:26.710 --> 00:24:28.082
And I figure, come
on, they must have

00:24:28.082 --> 00:24:29.665
put-- they were
drinking all the time.

00:24:29.665 --> 00:24:31.955
They put booze in
the still, right?

00:24:31.955 --> 00:24:34.580
It's not clear whether they did
or not, there's other evidence.

00:24:34.580 --> 00:24:37.170
The technology either spreads
or gets invented somewhere else.

00:24:37.170 --> 00:24:42.320
There's evidence of it between
150 AD and 400 AD in India.

00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:45.725
There's some reference to it in
China in 980, wine that burns.

00:24:45.725 --> 00:24:47.725
The alcohol content would
have to be high enough

00:24:47.725 --> 00:24:50.530
for it to burn so that it
would have to be distilled.

00:24:50.530 --> 00:24:53.010
In about 1000 AD you
see references in Russia

00:24:53.010 --> 00:24:55.902
to bread wine, vodka.

00:24:55.902 --> 00:24:58.670
In the 1200s there's
a big shot alchemist

00:24:58.670 --> 00:25:02.220
named Albertus Magnus who
writes about burning water.

00:25:02.220 --> 00:25:04.610
But in the mid 1280s,
this guy is the one

00:25:04.610 --> 00:25:05.860
who really puts it on the map.

00:25:05.860 --> 00:25:09.230
He's a physician from Bologna
named Taddeo Alderotti.

00:25:09.230 --> 00:25:11.720
He writes a book called
"Consilia Medicinalia"

00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:14.410
where he describes the
process for making something

00:25:14.410 --> 00:25:18.310
called aqua vita,
the water of life.

00:25:18.310 --> 00:25:20.900
And this stuff was magic.

00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:23.730
It would cure diseases,
it would relieve pain,

00:25:23.730 --> 00:25:26.415
it would fix bad breath, it
would purify spoiled wine,

00:25:26.415 --> 00:25:28.940
it would preserve meat,
you could draw essences out

00:25:28.940 --> 00:25:30.950
of plants and smell them later.

00:25:30.950 --> 00:25:33.510
For the first time, these
people who basically were just

00:25:33.510 --> 00:25:40.396
witch doctors finally had a
chemical that did something.

00:25:40.396 --> 00:25:41.520
They could make a medicine.

00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:42.519
It felt like a medicine.

00:25:42.519 --> 00:25:45.120
And in fact, it was just
about the only medicine

00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:48.286
that they gave anybody who
was dying of the Black Plague.

00:25:48.286 --> 00:25:49.910
Because they didn't
have anything else,

00:25:49.910 --> 00:25:55.012
which contributed to the spread
of alcoholism across Europe.

00:25:55.012 --> 00:25:56.470
What Alderotti also
figured out was

00:25:56.470 --> 00:25:57.969
that if you added
a serpentine coil

00:25:57.969 --> 00:26:00.510
from the top of a still and then
immersed that in cold water,

00:26:00.510 --> 00:26:02.030
the vapors that were
coming out of that still

00:26:02.030 --> 00:26:04.370
would condense more quickly,
and you'd get liquid.

00:26:04.370 --> 00:26:07.890
He put the capping
technology on top of a still.

00:26:07.890 --> 00:26:09.780
And it spread across Europe.

00:26:09.780 --> 00:26:11.580
Everyone starts distilling.

00:26:11.580 --> 00:26:14.110
You end up with
places like this.

00:26:14.110 --> 00:26:15.500
This is, I think, Jim Beam.

00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:17.180
That's the top of the
still at Jim Beam.

00:26:17.180 --> 00:26:18.470
That's a column still.

00:26:18.470 --> 00:26:20.880
It goes down six
floors from there.

00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:23.920
It's 60 or 70 feet tall.

00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:24.649
Or this.

00:26:24.649 --> 00:26:26.190
This is St George
spirits in Alameda.

00:26:26.190 --> 00:26:29.490
It's one of my
favorite distilleries.

00:26:29.490 --> 00:26:31.520
And this is a new one.

00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:34.934
This is New Caledonia
in Washington, DC.

00:26:34.934 --> 00:26:36.600
The columns are an
interesting addition,

00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:39.200
because what the columns do is
let you finesse that separation

00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:40.027
process further.

00:26:40.027 --> 00:26:41.860
The stuff you're
distilling goes in the top,

00:26:41.860 --> 00:26:43.750
steam goes up the
bottom, and the chemicals

00:26:43.750 --> 00:26:45.040
fractionate out in the middle.

00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:47.870
So whatever thing you want,
you can put an outlet pipe

00:26:47.870 --> 00:26:51.060
at a different height
on those columns

00:26:51.060 --> 00:26:52.560
and get out the
stuff that you want.

00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:55.170
It was a later addition
to the process.

00:26:58.634 --> 00:27:01.300
Basically, you put the stuff you
want to distill in that big pot

00:27:01.300 --> 00:27:02.500
and set it boiling.

00:27:02.500 --> 00:27:04.480
And then it's plumbing,
you turn it on.

00:27:08.015 --> 00:27:10.390
Scroll down a second, I'm
forgetting one important point.

00:27:15.520 --> 00:27:19.080
So that precision is important,
because otherwise you

00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:21.600
have to just time your
process of distilling,

00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:24.190
so you don't have like
methanol in it, which is toxic.

00:27:24.190 --> 00:27:25.700
Or you don't have kind
of yuckier flavors, which

00:27:25.700 --> 00:27:27.658
is what comes out at the
end of a distillation.

00:27:27.658 --> 00:27:30.437
You just want the middle,
the heart they call it.

00:27:30.437 --> 00:27:32.812
But the important thing I want
you to take away from this

00:27:32.812 --> 00:27:35.179
is the precision
that finally evolved.

00:27:35.179 --> 00:27:36.970
We go from this natural
process that nobody

00:27:36.970 --> 00:27:38.650
knows how it works
to one that we begin

00:27:38.650 --> 00:27:41.360
to identify how it works and
can take control of, or at least

00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:45.180
domesticate, to taking
the science of that

00:27:45.180 --> 00:27:47.180
and turning it into a
technological process, one

00:27:47.180 --> 00:27:50.120
that's precise, and one
that we use all the time.

00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:51.971
That's what's happened there.

00:27:51.971 --> 00:27:53.720
I have a couple more
things I want to say,

00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:56.680
but I feel like I
would be cheating you

00:27:56.680 --> 00:27:58.980
if I didn't talk a little
bit about hangovers.

00:27:58.980 --> 00:28:00.240
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:00.880
Is that true?

00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:01.680
I don't want to
just get out of here

00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:03.180
without telling you
about hangovers.

00:28:04.467 --> 00:28:06.050
Nobody knows anything
about hangovers.

00:28:08.621 --> 00:28:09.620
That's not totally true.

00:28:09.620 --> 00:28:10.890
There's not a lot of science.

00:28:10.890 --> 00:28:15.330
Here's one of the things I
love about the science of booze

00:28:15.330 --> 00:28:17.830
is of all of the
recreational drugs

00:28:17.830 --> 00:28:20.640
that people take-- whatever
your feelings about the legality

00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:23.350
and morality of that are,
we take a lot of them.

00:28:23.350 --> 00:28:25.399
Of all of those
drugs, the only one

00:28:25.399 --> 00:28:27.940
for which scientists have not
articulated a mechanism for how

00:28:27.940 --> 00:28:30.310
it works in the
brain is ethanol,

00:28:30.310 --> 00:28:32.502
the one we have
taken the longest.

00:28:32.502 --> 00:28:33.460
They don't really know.

00:28:33.460 --> 00:28:35.502
They've got some ideas.

00:28:35.502 --> 00:28:37.460
If you ask a researcher
who studies this stuff,

00:28:37.460 --> 00:28:39.890
well how does marijuana work--
or methamphetamine or opium.

00:28:39.890 --> 00:28:41.490
They know the receptor, they
know the region of the brain.

00:28:41.490 --> 00:28:42.906
They kind of know
what's going on.

00:28:42.906 --> 00:28:43.860
Ethanol?

00:28:43.860 --> 00:28:44.675
We got an idea.

00:28:44.675 --> 00:28:48.829
A couple of notions for
receptors, reaches the brain.

00:28:48.829 --> 00:28:50.620
Partially that may be
because if you really

00:28:50.620 --> 00:28:53.200
press a neuroscientist on
this, they don't really

00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:55.407
know how the brain works either.

00:28:55.407 --> 00:28:56.490
They have some good ideas.

00:28:56.490 --> 00:28:59.750
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:59.750 --> 00:29:01.780
A lot of the research
in alcohol and how

00:29:01.780 --> 00:29:06.025
it affects the human
body is on dependency

00:29:06.025 --> 00:29:07.730
and on binge drinking.

00:29:07.730 --> 00:29:08.752
As you would imagine.

00:29:08.752 --> 00:29:10.460
Those are problems,
and they kill people,

00:29:10.460 --> 00:29:11.990
and they hurt people, and
they cost a lot of money.

00:29:11.990 --> 00:29:14.115
So researchers are trying
to figure that stuff out.

00:29:14.115 --> 00:29:18.300
But the research on-- I
try to think of my book

00:29:18.300 --> 00:29:22.330
as taking place about three
sips into your second round.

00:29:22.330 --> 00:29:24.010
The pivot point of
my book is the moment

00:29:24.010 --> 00:29:25.510
when a bartender
serves you a drink.

00:29:25.510 --> 00:29:30.270
It's about what happens when you
have one drink or two drinks.

00:29:30.270 --> 00:29:33.410
But sometimes you mess up.

00:29:33.410 --> 00:29:37.540
A hangover is a symptom of that.

00:29:37.540 --> 00:29:40.065
There is not a lot of
science on hangovers.

00:29:40.065 --> 00:29:42.440
I will tell you that almost
everything that they told you

00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:47.390
the day before your first
weekend night of college

00:29:47.390 --> 00:29:49.574
is wrong, or at least unproven.

00:29:49.574 --> 00:29:50.990
So you're sitting
there and you're

00:29:50.990 --> 00:29:52.560
thinking it's dehydration.

00:29:52.560 --> 00:29:54.012
It's not dehydration.

00:29:54.012 --> 00:29:55.720
Your electrolyte levels
go back to normal

00:29:55.720 --> 00:29:57.136
when you're still
hungover and you

00:29:57.136 --> 00:29:59.617
can rehydrate and still
have the hangover.

00:29:59.617 --> 00:30:01.450
People think that because
alcohol suppresses

00:30:01.450 --> 00:30:04.060
a hormone called vasopressin,
it's an anti-diuretic hormone,

00:30:04.060 --> 00:30:06.560
it's the hormone that keeps
you from peeing all the time.

00:30:06.560 --> 00:30:08.400
Had too much alcohol, now
you're peeing all the time.

00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:11.070
Plus, you're not drinking water,
you're drinking beer, whatever.

00:30:11.070 --> 00:30:11.770
So yeah, you're dehydrated.

00:30:11.770 --> 00:30:12.940
But that's not the hangover.

00:30:12.940 --> 00:30:14.440
People think that
it's too much sugar.

00:30:14.440 --> 00:30:14.939
It's not.

00:30:14.939 --> 00:30:17.380
Your sugar levels are
fine when you're hungover.

00:30:17.380 --> 00:30:21.630
People think that it is, oh, I
had impure alcohol, congeners.

00:30:21.630 --> 00:30:24.420
I should have had clear
liquor instead of bourbon.

00:30:24.420 --> 00:30:24.920
It's not.

00:30:24.920 --> 00:30:27.650
You get just as hungover with
vodka as you do with bourbon.

00:30:27.650 --> 00:30:29.920
Some people report a worse
hangover with bourbon,

00:30:29.920 --> 00:30:32.110
but it's mostly anecdotal.

00:30:32.110 --> 00:30:34.431
More complicated,
acetaldehyde toxicity.

00:30:34.431 --> 00:30:35.930
No. acetaldehyde
is hard to measure,

00:30:35.930 --> 00:30:37.820
but your acetaldehyde
levels are zero.

00:30:37.820 --> 00:30:38.840
Methanol toxicity.

00:30:38.840 --> 00:30:40.310
There's some methanol
in anything fermented

00:30:40.310 --> 00:30:40.810
and distilled.

00:30:40.810 --> 00:30:42.060
The symptoms look
like they overlap.

00:30:42.060 --> 00:30:43.630
It would be great,
because it's a good excuse

00:30:43.630 --> 00:30:45.400
for the hair of the dog-- I
can explain that if you want.

00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:46.720
But it's probably not methanol.

00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:47.553
Nobody really knows.

00:30:47.553 --> 00:30:50.900
What it looks like is an
inflammatory response.

00:30:50.900 --> 00:30:53.516
Like if you have the flu,
you feel aches, you feel kind

00:30:53.516 --> 00:30:54.890
of stupid, you
have gut problems,

00:30:54.890 --> 00:30:57.640
your head aches-- it also has
some overlap symptomatology

00:30:57.640 --> 00:30:58.840
with migraine.

00:30:58.840 --> 00:31:01.090
So there are few
things that have ever

00:31:01.090 --> 00:31:06.090
been shown in real studies to
have an effect on a hangover.

00:31:06.090 --> 00:31:07.590
One of them is a
drug called Clotem.

00:31:07.590 --> 00:31:10.760
It's kind of a super high
powered anti-inflammatory

00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:13.490
that they prescribe for
migraines primarily.

00:31:13.490 --> 00:31:16.010
You can't get it in
the United States.

00:31:16.010 --> 00:31:17.564
I tried.

00:31:17.564 --> 00:31:19.980
Asked a neurologist, she was
like, I'm not prescribing it.

00:31:19.980 --> 00:31:22.450
It's not on the Pharmacopoeia,
and plus no I wouldn't.

00:31:22.450 --> 00:31:24.290
That's stupid, I'm
not doing that.

00:31:24.290 --> 00:31:25.748
I tried to get it
from a friend who

00:31:25.748 --> 00:31:27.310
lived in England,
to get her to lie

00:31:27.310 --> 00:31:29.670
to her doctor on the
National Health Service.

00:31:29.670 --> 00:31:31.570
She was like, no, I'm
not going to do that.

00:31:31.570 --> 00:31:32.592
So I've never tried it.

00:31:32.592 --> 00:31:34.550
But a few things that
are sold over the counter

00:31:34.550 --> 00:31:36.900
here have been shown
in studies to work.

00:31:36.900 --> 00:31:41.320
Pyritinol the left is
vitamin B-6 analog.

00:31:41.320 --> 00:31:45.230
It's two B-6 molecules
connected by a sulfur atom.

00:31:45.230 --> 00:31:49.070
The LiverCare thing is
an Ayurvedic therapy

00:31:49.070 --> 00:31:51.180
that's only been shown
to work in studies done

00:31:51.180 --> 00:31:55.460
by the company that makes it, so
take that for what it's worth.

00:31:55.460 --> 00:31:58.280
And one on the far right
is prickly pear cactus

00:31:58.280 --> 00:32:00.530
extract, which kind of
makes sense because it has

00:32:00.530 --> 00:32:03.070
mild anti-inflammatory
effects, prickly pear does.

00:32:03.070 --> 00:32:05.429
It also makes a
very good burrito.

00:32:05.429 --> 00:32:06.970
The one in the middle
is interesting,

00:32:06.970 --> 00:32:09.590
because the one in the middle
is-- they call it BluCetin.

00:32:09.590 --> 00:32:11.673
You can't see that well
in the picture, I'm sorry.

00:32:11.673 --> 00:32:15.090
But it's made from a molecule
called dihydromyricetin, which

00:32:15.090 --> 00:32:19.750
is an extract of a plant called
oriental raisin or hovenia,

00:32:19.750 --> 00:32:22.060
which is used to
treat alcohol problems

00:32:22.060 --> 00:32:24.750
in the traditional
Chinese pharmacopoeia.

00:32:24.750 --> 00:32:27.050
But a lab at UCLA
looked into it,

00:32:27.050 --> 00:32:31.050
and it does seem to affect
a receptor in the brain that

00:32:31.050 --> 00:32:33.790
looks like it's the target for
alcohol in that relevant range

00:32:33.790 --> 00:32:36.440
that I was talking about,
in that up to 0.06.

00:32:36.440 --> 00:32:38.670
Like the drink and a half range.

00:32:38.670 --> 00:32:41.300
It's a receptor
that's involved in how

00:32:41.300 --> 00:32:43.980
we feel benzodiazepines
drugs, like Valium.

00:32:43.980 --> 00:32:46.250
And that makes sense too,
because benzodiazepines

00:32:46.250 --> 00:32:48.330
and alcohol always have
a synergistic effect.

00:32:48.330 --> 00:32:50.705
They'll tell you if you're
taking a benzodiazepines don't

00:32:50.705 --> 00:32:53.750
drink also, because it will
knock you right on your ass.

00:32:53.750 --> 00:32:55.370
So that's a target
that some people

00:32:55.370 --> 00:32:58.356
are looking at for what receptor
ethanol actually affects.

00:32:58.356 --> 00:32:59.980
And this stuff is
supposed to block it.

00:32:59.980 --> 00:33:01.948
I've tried all of those.

00:33:01.948 --> 00:33:06.274
[EXHALES] I mean, maybe.

00:33:06.274 --> 00:33:07.940
Don't trust anecdote
and obviously don't

00:33:07.940 --> 00:33:10.810
do medical things that I say,
because journalist, not doctor.

00:33:10.810 --> 00:33:12.910
That would be goofy.

00:33:12.910 --> 00:33:15.379
But I mentioned this is
an inflammatory response.

00:33:15.379 --> 00:33:17.420
And so now you're thinking,
because you're smart,

00:33:17.420 --> 00:33:20.900
you're like, I'm just going
to take ibuprofen, right?

00:33:20.900 --> 00:33:22.520
Anti-inflammatory.

00:33:22.520 --> 00:33:25.640
Here's the thing.

00:33:25.640 --> 00:33:29.319
Ibuprofen has as a side effect
gastrointestinal problems.

00:33:29.319 --> 00:33:30.860
Take a lot of it,
you get a GI bleed.

00:33:30.860 --> 00:33:32.609
You already have
gastrointestinal problems

00:33:32.609 --> 00:33:34.540
from the hangover, so
now you're thinking,

00:33:34.540 --> 00:33:36.540
oh, well I'll take
it with a Pepcid.

00:33:36.540 --> 00:33:38.220
And now you're taking
a fistful of stuff

00:33:38.220 --> 00:33:40.030
that you're not really sure
is going to work, which

00:33:40.030 --> 00:33:41.446
makes me nervous,
I have to admit.

00:33:41.446 --> 00:33:45.140
But also-- so in the excerpt of
the book that ran in "Wired,"

00:33:45.140 --> 00:33:47.430
I said I've started taking
a couple of ibuprofen

00:33:47.430 --> 00:33:49.950
before I go to bed
or when I wake up.

00:33:49.950 --> 00:33:51.419
And people came
at me on Twitter.

00:33:51.419 --> 00:33:52.710
You're going to get a GI bleed.

00:33:52.710 --> 00:33:54.400
Like how often do you
think I'm doing this?

00:33:54.400 --> 00:33:54.899
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:54.899 --> 00:33:56.210
No, no, no.

00:33:56.210 --> 00:33:56.980
Settle down.

00:33:56.980 --> 00:33:59.120
This is not-- I don't
think it's a problem yet.

00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:01.200
Of course, like nobody
ever does, right?

00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:05.130
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:05.130 --> 00:34:08.350
Anyway, so I wish I had
better news about hangovers.

00:34:08.350 --> 00:34:12.184
The anti-inflammatory thing
I think has possibilities.

00:34:12.184 --> 00:34:13.350
So where does that leave us.

00:34:13.350 --> 00:34:16.489
So I was in Japan a couple of
weeks ago, family vacation.

00:34:16.489 --> 00:34:20.730
And the Imperial Hotel
in Tokyo right now

00:34:20.730 --> 00:34:24.380
is this giant, brutalist,
skyscraper-looking place,

00:34:24.380 --> 00:34:25.080
very ugly.

00:34:25.080 --> 00:34:27.547
But the original
Imperial Hotel in Tokyo

00:34:27.547 --> 00:34:28.880
was built by Frank Lloyd Wright.

00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:32.389
It was one of the most
beautiful buildings anywhere.

00:34:32.389 --> 00:34:34.139
Like so many Frank
Lloyd Wright buildings,

00:34:34.139 --> 00:34:37.480
it fell down in the 1960s.

00:34:37.480 --> 00:34:40.710
Not a good engineer,
Frank Lloyd Wright.

00:34:40.710 --> 00:34:42.600
But the one place
in the building

00:34:42.600 --> 00:34:45.989
that still has the original
Frank Lloyd Wright appointments

00:34:45.989 --> 00:34:47.639
is the old bar.

00:34:47.639 --> 00:34:49.900
So you can go to the old
Imperial Bar in the hotel,

00:34:49.900 --> 00:34:52.429
and it has beautiful
Frank Lloyd Wright wall

00:34:52.429 --> 00:34:55.305
hangings and the
tiles and stuff.

00:34:55.305 --> 00:34:57.430
It's really nice and it's
a very nice cocktail bar,

00:34:57.430 --> 00:34:59.470
so I wanted to go.

00:34:59.470 --> 00:35:03.314
Because I-- I ordered this
drink call the Gemini,

00:35:03.314 --> 00:35:04.980
it's their house
drink, it was terrible.

00:35:04.980 --> 00:35:06.521
But the coaster's
really nice, right?

00:35:06.521 --> 00:35:07.710
It's a beautiful coaster.

00:35:07.710 --> 00:35:09.835
Because I wanted to feel
the connection to history,

00:35:09.835 --> 00:35:13.610
to a Frank Lloyd Wright
building and to the history

00:35:13.610 --> 00:35:14.350
of cocktails.

00:35:14.350 --> 00:35:17.390
And that's a thing that
alcohol will give you,

00:35:17.390 --> 00:35:20.352
is that connection down
through shallow time,

00:35:20.352 --> 00:35:22.810
with Frank Lloyd Wright and
then deeper with the people who

00:35:22.810 --> 00:35:25.490
first started making
gin, for example,

00:35:25.490 --> 00:35:27.790
which human beings
were making 1,000 years

00:35:27.790 --> 00:35:30.670
before they knew how it worked.

00:35:30.670 --> 00:35:33.330
They were making it without
really knowing how to make it.

00:35:33.330 --> 00:35:35.788
They still don't really know
why we taste it the way we do.

00:35:35.788 --> 00:35:41.012
We make this stuff, and
it affects our senses--

00:35:41.012 --> 00:35:42.220
our sense of smell and taste.

00:35:42.220 --> 00:35:43.886
And you and I would
taste the same thing

00:35:43.886 --> 00:35:47.464
and if we told each other
that it tasted the same to us,

00:35:47.464 --> 00:35:49.630
we might be talking about
actually different flavors

00:35:49.630 --> 00:35:52.005
in our heads, or we might
taste entirely different things

00:35:52.005 --> 00:35:53.550
in it, and nobody
really knows why.

00:35:53.550 --> 00:35:56.060
It alters our bodies,
it changes our minds,

00:35:56.060 --> 00:35:57.900
and nobody really knows how.

00:35:57.900 --> 00:36:00.070
They're working on it.

00:36:00.070 --> 00:36:02.679
We taste it differently, we
feel its effects differently,

00:36:02.679 --> 00:36:04.970
every culture that uses it
has different rituals for it

00:36:04.970 --> 00:36:08.170
and manifest the effects
of that differently.

00:36:08.170 --> 00:36:12.840
We have cracked open yeast
and the other microbes that

00:36:12.840 --> 00:36:15.340
are responsible for it and begun
to understand that biology.

00:36:15.340 --> 00:36:17.361
Yeast are an incredibly
important model organism

00:36:17.361 --> 00:36:17.860
in science.

00:36:17.860 --> 00:36:19.250
They were the
first organism that

00:36:19.250 --> 00:36:22.700
was ever a genetic sequence for.

00:36:22.700 --> 00:36:26.660
So we've gone from the
agricultural process

00:36:26.660 --> 00:36:28.970
of domesticating a microbe
we only understood vaguely

00:36:28.970 --> 00:36:32.550
to the cold precision
of genetic engineering.

00:36:32.550 --> 00:36:35.770
But really, we were making
booze before we had science,

00:36:35.770 --> 00:36:38.140
much less before we
had booze science.

00:36:38.140 --> 00:36:39.910
Now that we have
all that science,

00:36:39.910 --> 00:36:43.032
now that we understand
it a little bit more,

00:36:43.032 --> 00:36:45.490
I don't want you to think that
that makes the stuff that we

00:36:45.490 --> 00:36:49.450
drink less magical,
less amazing.

00:36:49.450 --> 00:36:53.470
I'm, I guess, paraphrasing
Arthur C Clarke a little bit.

00:36:53.470 --> 00:36:56.250
Magic is just
advanced technology.

00:36:56.250 --> 00:36:58.020
The science that we
use to make this stuff

00:36:58.020 --> 00:37:00.160
is what makes the magic.

00:37:00.160 --> 00:37:02.597
What I want to argue, and
what I want to leave you with,

00:37:02.597 --> 00:37:04.680
is this notion that when
you are tasting something

00:37:04.680 --> 00:37:07.220
that you're drinking-- whatever
it is, if you're tasting

00:37:07.220 --> 00:37:11.610
the strawberry notes in a
nice glass of white wine

00:37:11.610 --> 00:37:15.149
or the smoke in a
peated Ila whisky--

00:37:15.149 --> 00:37:17.440
that while you are tasting
all those things what you're

00:37:17.440 --> 00:37:19.856
actually tasting, those flavors
and aromas you are tasting

00:37:19.856 --> 00:37:21.701
is civilization.

00:37:21.701 --> 00:37:22.200
Thank you.

00:37:22.200 --> 00:37:23.350
That's what I've got.

00:37:23.350 --> 00:37:26.836
[APPLAUSE]

00:37:31.274 --> 00:37:32.190
Look, it's my desktop.

00:37:32.190 --> 00:37:34.950
Sorry about that.

00:37:34.950 --> 00:37:36.769
I can do questions for a bit.

00:37:36.769 --> 00:37:37.810
Do we have time for that?

00:37:37.810 --> 00:37:38.309
Is that OK?

00:37:44.649 --> 00:37:46.940
I can't tell if you're walking
out or asking questions.

00:37:46.940 --> 00:37:47.773
You have to tell me.

00:37:47.773 --> 00:37:48.570
Oh good.

00:37:48.570 --> 00:37:51.780
AUDIENCE: So it sounds like a
lot of the process of making

00:37:51.780 --> 00:37:55.960
booze is to get to the sugar.

00:37:55.960 --> 00:37:59.437
So, can I just put
water and sugar, and--

00:37:59.437 --> 00:38:00.520
ADAM ROGERS: Yeah, please.

00:38:00.520 --> 00:38:02.353
Listen, some of my
hyperbole is intentional.

00:38:02.353 --> 00:38:05.290
So go ahead and challenge away.

00:38:05.290 --> 00:38:05.790
Oh, Yeah.

00:38:05.790 --> 00:38:07.120
No totally, well I mean
that's what rum is.

00:38:07.120 --> 00:38:09.120
AUDIENCE: Can I just buy
Domino sugar and make--

00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:11.160
ADAM ROGERS: Yeah, that's rum.

00:38:11.160 --> 00:38:13.670
A lot of the rum that we
drink-- I mean, not exactly.

00:38:13.670 --> 00:38:17.250
Well, let me calibrate
that slightly.

00:38:17.250 --> 00:38:18.560
Most rum is made from molasses.

00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:21.260
Molasses is a byproduct
of processing sugar cane

00:38:21.260 --> 00:38:22.760
into sugar.

00:38:22.760 --> 00:38:25.650
If you want to make
white powdered sugar,

00:38:25.650 --> 00:38:27.830
you end up with a
lot of molasses,

00:38:27.830 --> 00:38:29.220
which ferments really easily.

00:38:29.220 --> 00:38:31.580
In fact, it ferments so
easily that you really

00:38:31.580 --> 00:38:34.569
want your rum distillery next
to your sugar cane processing

00:38:34.569 --> 00:38:36.360
plant, because it comes
right out of there.

00:38:36.360 --> 00:38:37.450
And you've got to get
it into the still,

00:38:37.450 --> 00:38:39.420
because otherwise all the
wild stuff's going to colonize

00:38:39.420 --> 00:38:40.220
and it will go bad.

00:38:40.220 --> 00:38:42.730
You can also make a drink
called Rhum Agricole.

00:38:42.730 --> 00:38:44.711
Rhum Agricole is
made from cane juice.

00:38:44.711 --> 00:38:47.210
So you can just squeeze sugar
cane, have you ever tasted it?

00:38:47.210 --> 00:38:48.810
It's delicious just like that.

00:38:48.810 --> 00:38:51.080
It's not super sweet,
it's just really good.

00:38:51.080 --> 00:38:53.450
And you can distill that,
make a Rhum Agricole.

00:38:53.450 --> 00:38:55.810
It's a product that
got made in a lot

00:38:55.810 --> 00:38:58.520
of the former French
colonies in South America

00:38:58.520 --> 00:38:59.830
and in the Caribbean.

00:38:59.830 --> 00:39:00.641
You can find them.

00:39:00.641 --> 00:39:01.390
They're delicious.

00:39:01.390 --> 00:39:05.080
They're really interesting, they
smell kind of funky and grassy.

00:39:05.080 --> 00:39:09.220
And if you're making
moonshine-- famously moonshine

00:39:09.220 --> 00:39:11.500
is whiskey, un-aged whiskey.

00:39:11.500 --> 00:39:14.760
But like cheap moonshine--
especially present day,

00:39:14.760 --> 00:39:17.370
cheap, illegal
moonshine-- is often

00:39:17.370 --> 00:39:20.380
like they go buy a lot of sugar,
ferment that, and distill it.

00:39:20.380 --> 00:39:21.730
Or they use any sugar substrate.

00:39:21.730 --> 00:39:25.580
I've seen a mash
made from donuts.

00:39:25.580 --> 00:39:27.340
Tastes as good as
you would expect.

00:39:27.340 --> 00:39:30.250
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:30.250 --> 00:39:32.740
What else?

00:39:32.740 --> 00:39:34.650
AUDIENCE: So a
lot of the liquors

00:39:34.650 --> 00:39:37.249
have precursors, like
whiskey is distilled beer.

00:39:37.249 --> 00:39:38.040
ADAM ROGERS: Right.

00:39:38.040 --> 00:39:39.730
AUDIENCE: And brandy
is distilled--

00:39:39.730 --> 00:39:40.480
ADAM ROGERS: Wine.

00:39:40.480 --> 00:39:42.520
AUDIENCE: --Wine.

00:39:42.520 --> 00:39:45.670
Who thought up vodka?

00:39:45.670 --> 00:39:50.950
ADAM ROGERS: Well, so, a lot
of people who think about booze

00:39:50.950 --> 00:39:54.157
or who write about
it go by category.

00:39:54.157 --> 00:39:55.490
It's a perfectly good heuristic.

00:39:55.490 --> 00:39:58.830
Wine, beer, tequila,
rum, scotch, whatever.

00:39:58.830 --> 00:40:01.330
They write about
a specific thing.

00:40:01.330 --> 00:40:05.800
I'm intentionally forcing
a different heuristic,

00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:07.050
which is process.

00:40:07.050 --> 00:40:10.140
Which goes-- and this is
the structure of the book.

00:40:10.140 --> 00:40:12.395
Starts with yeast,
goes to sugar,

00:40:12.395 --> 00:40:17.500
you ferment that, you distill
it, you can age it in a barrel.

00:40:17.500 --> 00:40:19.530
Then you taste and smell it.

00:40:19.530 --> 00:40:22.590
Take a drink, has affect on
your body, on your brain.

00:40:22.590 --> 00:40:26.470
And any alcohol, any booze
falls under those categories.

00:40:26.470 --> 00:40:30.700
So vodka is easy,
because vodka, you

00:40:30.700 --> 00:40:32.780
can use any substrate you want.

00:40:32.780 --> 00:40:35.130
And famously it's oh,
Russians had potatoes.

00:40:35.130 --> 00:40:36.030
But you can make
it out of anything,

00:40:36.030 --> 00:40:37.930
because all you're doing is
running it through the still so

00:40:37.930 --> 00:40:39.429
many times that
you're stripping out

00:40:39.429 --> 00:40:42.420
every molecule, except
ethanol and water.

00:40:42.420 --> 00:40:44.917
In fact, in the United States
if you're selling vodka,

00:40:44.917 --> 00:40:46.500
that's all that's
allowed to be in it.

00:40:46.500 --> 00:40:48.200
Those are the only molecules.

00:40:48.200 --> 00:40:49.970
It's just H2O and ethanol.

00:40:49.970 --> 00:40:50.960
That's it.

00:40:50.960 --> 00:40:55.030
Which is weird, because
they taste different.

00:40:55.030 --> 00:40:57.520
So you go well,
how does that work?

00:40:57.520 --> 00:41:00.100
Maybe the levels of alcohol
are different, sometimes.

00:41:00.100 --> 00:41:04.730
But if they all say 80 proof,
they're all 40% percent ABV.

00:41:04.730 --> 00:41:08.320
If it's all 40% ethanol
molecules and 60% water

00:41:08.320 --> 00:41:10.190
molecules, what's going on?

00:41:10.190 --> 00:41:11.800
Some of it might
just be marketing.

00:41:11.800 --> 00:41:13.920
Theater is super
important with booze.

00:41:13.920 --> 00:41:15.295
Marketing in the
theater of-- you

00:41:15.295 --> 00:41:19.420
know, imagine that bottle of red
wine that you had on that trip

00:41:19.420 --> 00:41:22.800
where you got lost and you found
that perfect little trattoria

00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:23.314
in Tuscany.

00:41:23.314 --> 00:41:24.730
And you got that
bottle and it was

00:41:24.730 --> 00:41:25.850
like the best
bottle of red wine.

00:41:25.850 --> 00:41:26.840
And then you get
the stuff at home

00:41:26.840 --> 00:41:28.798
and watching it in front
of a "Star Trek" rerun

00:41:28.798 --> 00:41:32.580
it doesn't quite--
it's not really as good

00:41:32.580 --> 00:41:33.507
out of the Mason jar.

00:41:33.507 --> 00:41:34.840
It's like well, it's still good.

00:41:34.840 --> 00:41:35.710
Don't get me wrong.

00:41:35.710 --> 00:41:39.500
Plus this is the one with
the green Orion slave girl.

00:41:39.500 --> 00:41:42.780
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:42.780 --> 00:41:44.350
Always makes wine better.

00:41:44.350 --> 00:41:47.620
But there's a hypothesis.

00:41:47.620 --> 00:41:49.990
I have a paper that's
pretty great that

00:41:49.990 --> 00:41:52.879
suggests that the relationship
between those molecules

00:41:52.879 --> 00:41:55.170
can change depending on
levels, because the water forms

00:41:55.170 --> 00:41:56.294
what are called clathrates.

00:41:56.294 --> 00:41:59.940
Basically they're
kind of H2O crystals

00:41:59.940 --> 00:42:02.340
that surround the ethanol.

00:42:02.340 --> 00:42:04.220
And the different
shapes of those crystals

00:42:04.220 --> 00:42:07.900
might be perceptible as a
matter of flavor or aroma.

00:42:07.900 --> 00:42:10.149
It's tantalizing as a paper.

00:42:10.149 --> 00:42:11.690
And it was a pretty
good paper that I

00:42:11.690 --> 00:42:13.240
don't know that
anybody followed up on.

00:42:13.240 --> 00:42:15.905
It also, of course, came out of
a lab in Russia, as you expect.

00:42:18.340 --> 00:42:18.840
What else?

00:42:21.827 --> 00:42:23.660
AUDIENCE: You mentioned
the hair of the dog.

00:42:23.660 --> 00:42:25.243
Can you talk a little
more about that?

00:42:25.243 --> 00:42:28.880
ADAM ROGERS: Yeah, good,
thank you for reminding me.

00:42:28.880 --> 00:42:31.450
So there used to
be a whole class

00:42:31.450 --> 00:42:33.880
of cocktails called pick me ups.

00:42:33.880 --> 00:42:35.380
And the pick me ups
were drinks that

00:42:35.380 --> 00:42:37.600
were designed to
drink in the morning,

00:42:37.600 --> 00:42:40.238
because everybody was
drunk all the time.

00:42:40.238 --> 00:42:43.170
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:43.170 --> 00:42:43.870
Awesome.

00:42:43.870 --> 00:42:45.578
It's what it's like
at Yahoo, not Google.

00:42:45.578 --> 00:42:48.362
You guys don't drink like that.

00:42:48.362 --> 00:42:49.820
You don't see many
of them anymore.

00:42:49.820 --> 00:42:53.680
So the last one--
acceptable morning

00:42:53.680 --> 00:42:56.093
drinks now, the bloody
family, like a Bloody Maria

00:42:56.093 --> 00:42:59.890
or a Caesar or a Bloody Mary,
and a Mimosa, you see those.

00:42:59.890 --> 00:43:01.680
The Corpse Reviver Number Two?

00:43:01.680 --> 00:43:02.970
Do you know this drink?

00:43:02.970 --> 00:43:03.829
I love that drink.

00:43:03.829 --> 00:43:04.620
It's a great drink.

00:43:04.620 --> 00:43:07.260
The Corpse Reviver Number Two
does not refer to zombies.

00:43:07.260 --> 00:43:10.040
The corpse in that name
is the hungover person

00:43:10.040 --> 00:43:11.540
who has dragged
himself into a bar,

00:43:11.540 --> 00:43:14.580
before going to work that
day to try to come back.

00:43:14.580 --> 00:43:16.402
So that's hair of the dog.

00:43:16.402 --> 00:43:17.860
The idea is that
if you're hungover

00:43:17.860 --> 00:43:18.880
you have a little bit
of booze, and that

00:43:18.880 --> 00:43:20.546
makes you not feel
the hangover anymore.

00:43:20.546 --> 00:43:22.820
So probably all it does is
just delay the hangover,

00:43:22.820 --> 00:43:24.740
because you're more
relaxed about it.

00:43:24.740 --> 00:43:25.710
But there is a theory.

00:43:25.710 --> 00:43:28.177
I mentioned methanol toxicity.

00:43:28.177 --> 00:43:30.510
There is a theory that says
that a hangover are actually

00:43:30.510 --> 00:43:34.380
the symptoms of a very, very,
small amount of methanol.

00:43:34.380 --> 00:43:36.390
So methanol's really cool.

00:43:36.390 --> 00:43:38.190
It's a different alcohol.

00:43:38.190 --> 00:43:40.620
And alcohol
dehydrogenase-- we all

00:43:40.620 --> 00:43:42.200
make that too,
that's how we process

00:43:42.200 --> 00:43:46.240
alcohol in our own bodies--
will work on methanol also.

00:43:46.240 --> 00:43:49.880
But instead of
having ethanol, which

00:43:49.880 --> 00:43:52.190
it can change into
acetaldehyde aldehyde

00:43:52.190 --> 00:43:54.260
in us, when it
works on methanol,

00:43:54.260 --> 00:43:58.952
it changes it into
formaldehyde, which is bad.

00:43:58.952 --> 00:44:01.160
Doesn't last long in the
body, it's not good for you,

00:44:01.160 --> 00:44:03.040
but it kind of goes away.

00:44:03.040 --> 00:44:05.400
But it turns into
formic acid, which

00:44:05.400 --> 00:44:07.570
is the stuff in ant venom.

00:44:07.570 --> 00:44:10.130
So you get acidosis.

00:44:10.130 --> 00:44:11.900
Formic acid interferes
with the enzyme

00:44:11.900 --> 00:44:14.620
that we use to process
oxygen in our cells.

00:44:14.620 --> 00:44:17.810
So the heaviest oxygen
users in our body

00:44:17.810 --> 00:44:19.890
are the eyes and the brain.

00:44:19.890 --> 00:44:21.759
That's why when you
have oxygen deprivation

00:44:21.759 --> 00:44:24.050
the first thing that happens
is you stop seeing colors.

00:44:24.050 --> 00:44:26.050
And then you get
that tunnel that

00:44:26.050 --> 00:44:27.900
closes in when
you're not breathing.

00:44:30.447 --> 00:44:32.530
Formic acid messes with
the enzyme that does that.

00:44:32.530 --> 00:44:34.450
It's why methanol toxicity
will make you go blind.

00:44:34.450 --> 00:44:37.120
And eventually it goes into the
brain, messes with the brain's

00:44:37.120 --> 00:44:39.529
ability to deal with oxygen,
you get Parkinsonian tremor.

00:44:39.529 --> 00:44:40.570
Eventually, it kills you.

00:44:40.570 --> 00:44:43.080
But if you show up in an
emergency room with methanol

00:44:43.080 --> 00:44:46.282
toxicity, not that
I'm recommending this,

00:44:46.282 --> 00:44:47.740
the first thing
the doctors will do

00:44:47.740 --> 00:44:49.656
is they will give you a
giant dose of ethanol.

00:44:49.656 --> 00:44:52.836
Because ethanol displaces
the methanol off the enzyme.

00:44:52.836 --> 00:44:54.710
The enzyme would much
rather work on ethanol.

00:44:54.710 --> 00:44:57.052
They hit you with the
ethanol, the enzyme

00:44:57.052 --> 00:44:59.510
throws the methanol overboard,
goes to work on the ethanol,

00:44:59.510 --> 00:45:01.551
and you excrete the methanol
through your breath,

00:45:01.551 --> 00:45:02.350
and you pee it out.

00:45:02.350 --> 00:45:04.110
Basically, that's
the therapy for it.

00:45:04.110 --> 00:45:08.560
So the notion is if a
hangover is methanol toxicity,

00:45:08.560 --> 00:45:10.070
you're going to
have another drink,

00:45:10.070 --> 00:45:13.119
the ethanol will displace
the methanol off the enzyme,

00:45:13.119 --> 00:45:14.160
and you will feel better.

00:45:14.160 --> 00:45:17.590
That's the theory--
that's the hypothesis,

00:45:17.590 --> 00:45:18.650
nobody's proved that.

00:45:18.650 --> 00:45:22.280
It's a great just-so story.

00:45:22.280 --> 00:45:24.030
It sounds terrible.

00:45:24.030 --> 00:45:26.700
It sounds like an awful solution
to me that I have not tried.

00:45:26.700 --> 00:45:28.440
The other bad
thing about this is

00:45:28.440 --> 00:45:32.510
that according to
some studies, the kind

00:45:32.510 --> 00:45:35.820
of person who-- it's like
10% of the people who

00:45:35.820 --> 00:45:38.540
admit to trying hair of
the dog regularly also

00:45:38.540 --> 00:45:41.270
end up becoming alcoholics.

00:45:41.270 --> 00:45:43.490
They sound related,
but not causal, right?

00:45:46.650 --> 00:45:49.070
AUDIENCE: So I know
that a lot of alcohol

00:45:49.070 --> 00:45:51.290
relies on wild yeast,
but when people--

00:45:51.290 --> 00:45:52.520
ADAM ROGERS: Relies on sorry?

00:45:52.520 --> 00:45:53.360
AUDIENCE: --On wild yeast.

00:45:53.360 --> 00:45:53.970
ADAM ROGERS: Oh,
wild yeast, sure.

00:45:53.970 --> 00:45:55.420
AUDIENCE: So when
did people start

00:45:55.420 --> 00:45:58.110
isolating yeast and
actually culturing it?

00:45:58.110 --> 00:46:01.160
ADAM ROGERS: Yeah, I
don't know if there's

00:46:01.160 --> 00:46:03.300
a great answer to that.

00:46:03.300 --> 00:46:05.460
There is a notion--
you can imagine

00:46:05.460 --> 00:46:08.166
at first it's all
just your starter.

00:46:08.166 --> 00:46:09.790
Just like people had
sourdough starters

00:46:09.790 --> 00:46:11.010
that they would pass down.

00:46:11.010 --> 00:46:13.840
So you'd go, well that winery
over there makes good wine

00:46:13.840 --> 00:46:16.660
regularly, and that winery
on that hill doesn't.

00:46:16.660 --> 00:46:18.540
So I'm going to buy
it from over there,

00:46:18.540 --> 00:46:20.890
without knowing it's
because their yeast sucks

00:46:20.890 --> 00:46:23.060
and their yeast
works really well.

00:46:23.060 --> 00:46:28.920
But you get until
the late 1880s when

00:46:28.920 --> 00:46:30.840
people start to really
kind of consciously

00:46:30.840 --> 00:46:32.923
study the yeast strain and
make sure it's working.

00:46:32.923 --> 00:46:36.247
And a lot of that comes out
of-- oh, which brewery is it.

00:46:36.247 --> 00:46:37.330
I'm not going to remember.

00:46:37.330 --> 00:46:39.622
But a specific lager
maker in Germany,

00:46:39.622 --> 00:46:41.580
where they were like
we're going to have a lab.

00:46:41.580 --> 00:46:42.710
We're going to
understand our yeast.

00:46:42.710 --> 00:46:44.626
We're going to figure
out where it comes from.

00:46:44.626 --> 00:46:48.190
For a while they even thought
they had a unique yeast.

00:46:48.190 --> 00:46:49.110
It's Carlsberg.

00:46:49.110 --> 00:46:52.206
So they started calling it
Saccharomyces carlsbergensis.

00:46:52.206 --> 00:46:54.906
That was making
their exact lager.

00:46:54.906 --> 00:46:57.280
Turns out it probably was a
mix of a couple other strains

00:46:57.280 --> 00:47:00.140
that nobody knows where one of
them came from yet actually.

00:47:00.140 --> 00:47:02.321
But it was late
where people started

00:47:02.321 --> 00:47:03.320
to really focus on that.

00:47:03.320 --> 00:47:06.290
And there's still a
controversy in distilling,

00:47:06.290 --> 00:47:09.454
especially about how important
the strain of yeast is.

00:47:09.454 --> 00:47:11.495
Whether you can just use
any old commodity yeast,

00:47:11.495 --> 00:47:13.078
or whether you need
your specific one.

00:47:13.078 --> 00:47:15.662
Brewers, especially-- you know
any home brewers you know this.

00:47:15.662 --> 00:47:17.744
They'll be very specific
about like that's a yeast

00:47:17.744 --> 00:47:20.220
that you make a very specific
kind of beer with, ale,

00:47:20.220 --> 00:47:20.890
whatever.

00:47:20.890 --> 00:47:22.320
And they want to stick with it.

00:47:25.737 --> 00:47:27.320
AUDIENCE: You mentioned
the alchemists

00:47:27.320 --> 00:47:28.910
and the early alcohol things.

00:47:28.910 --> 00:47:31.150
And they mixed them with
herbals and made medicines.

00:47:31.150 --> 00:47:34.740
And being Italian, I'm a fan
of amaros and herbal things

00:47:34.740 --> 00:47:37.970
and get my Fernet
Branca after dinner.

00:47:37.970 --> 00:47:39.470
Do you think there's
a direct link--

00:47:39.470 --> 00:47:41.136
ADAM ROGERS: Must be
from San Francisco.

00:47:41.136 --> 00:47:43.842
AUDIENCE: --No, New
York, born and bred.

00:47:43.842 --> 00:47:45.800
Do you think there was
a direct link from that.

00:47:45.800 --> 00:47:47.900
I mean, did they take the
medicines and carry it forward,

00:47:47.900 --> 00:47:49.358
and people said,
you know what, I'm

00:47:49.358 --> 00:47:51.110
going to drink this any time.

00:47:51.110 --> 00:47:54.930
Or was it lost and rediscovered?

00:47:54.930 --> 00:47:59.930
ADAM ROGERS: You can
still get the drinks that

00:47:59.930 --> 00:48:03.230
are if not the actual
recipe, descendants

00:48:03.230 --> 00:48:05.290
of the recipe, from
the monks taking

00:48:05.290 --> 00:48:08.630
the herbs in their garden and
macerating it in neutral spirit

00:48:08.630 --> 00:48:09.880
or distilling it with.

00:48:09.880 --> 00:48:11.070
You know, Chartreuse--

00:48:11.070 --> 00:48:11.580
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I guess.

00:48:11.580 --> 00:48:12.871
ADAM ROGERS: --And Benedictine.

00:48:12.871 --> 00:48:14.450
Benedictine, right?

00:48:14.450 --> 00:48:16.180
Benedictine monks
make Benedictine.

00:48:16.180 --> 00:48:19.270
That's why it's called that.

00:48:19.270 --> 00:48:22.320
That's why I like the amari
and Chartreuse and Benedictine

00:48:22.320 --> 00:48:25.000
especially, because I feel like
that's a connection to at least

00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:27.050
to the 1600s and what
they were making then.

00:48:27.050 --> 00:48:28.660
It's the same recipe.

00:48:28.660 --> 00:48:31.421
Probably tastes different
for a lot of other reasons.

00:48:31.421 --> 00:48:33.920
But if what you're asking is
when did it stop being medicine

00:48:33.920 --> 00:48:36.130
and become fun--

00:48:36.130 --> 00:48:38.740
AUDIENCE: Sort of.

00:48:38.740 --> 00:48:40.230
ADAM ROGERS: --That
is less clear.

00:48:40.230 --> 00:48:44.720
Although, there's a chunk
of history in the book,

00:48:44.720 --> 00:48:47.360
but there's not a lot of
cocktail history, I'll admit.

00:48:47.360 --> 00:48:49.100
But I've read a lot
of it and I like it.

00:48:49.100 --> 00:48:53.270
So some of that
mixing traces back,

00:48:53.270 --> 00:48:59.180
interestingly, I think, not
to bars but to pharmacies.

00:48:59.180 --> 00:49:02.100
So pharmacies were also
allowed to dispense alcohol

00:49:02.100 --> 00:49:05.520
in this country
in the early '18s.

00:49:05.520 --> 00:49:07.255
So call it '10s, '20s.

00:49:07.255 --> 00:49:09.130
Pharmacists were allowed
to dispense alcohol.

00:49:09.130 --> 00:49:10.838
They were also allowed
to dispense things

00:49:10.838 --> 00:49:13.590
like extract of cocaine and
opiates and stuff like that.

00:49:13.590 --> 00:49:17.000
And they were also places where
unlike bars, women could go,

00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:19.580
so they were more
social in their own way.

00:49:19.580 --> 00:49:21.370
There's a book called
"Fix the Pumps"

00:49:21.370 --> 00:49:24.110
by a guy named Darcy O'Neill
that's great about this.

00:49:24.110 --> 00:49:26.330
And one of the things
that Darcy says,

00:49:26.330 --> 00:49:31.360
is these pharmacists were
making bitters, tonics,

00:49:31.360 --> 00:49:33.024
that you could mix
with soda water.

00:49:33.024 --> 00:49:34.440
That's where Coca
Cola comes from,

00:49:34.440 --> 00:49:36.580
it's where Dr. Pepper--
like Dr. Pepper.

00:49:36.580 --> 00:49:38.250
That's his recipe.

00:49:38.250 --> 00:49:40.075
Or Boker's Bitters
or Angostura Bitters.

00:49:40.075 --> 00:49:41.700
That's where all that
stuff comes from.

00:49:41.700 --> 00:49:43.340
These ingredients-- so
you begin to be like,

00:49:43.340 --> 00:49:45.010
oh, I'll mix that up, and
maybe I'll put some ice in it.

00:49:45.010 --> 00:49:45.930
And there's ice cream.

00:49:45.930 --> 00:49:49.660
You could have ice cream
at the soda fountain too.

00:49:49.660 --> 00:49:53.490
So that's where at least
what we would consider

00:49:53.490 --> 00:49:55.580
the modern version of
the cocktail comes from.

00:49:55.580 --> 00:49:59.045
And it transitions from being
a medication-- or at least

00:49:59.045 --> 00:50:00.420
something that we
all just say is

00:50:00.420 --> 00:50:03.070
a medication-- into something
that's recreational.

00:50:09.020 --> 00:50:11.196
AUDIENCE: I like I like
some really old whiskey's.

00:50:11.196 --> 00:50:12.960
ADAM ROGERS: Me too.

00:50:12.960 --> 00:50:13.960
Man.

00:50:13.960 --> 00:50:15.918
AUDIENCE: Unfortunately
they're very expensive.

00:50:15.918 --> 00:50:17.030
ADAM ROGERS: I know.

00:50:17.030 --> 00:50:18.900
It sucks.

00:50:18.900 --> 00:50:21.910
AUDIENCE: So I'm wondering if
you see a future in which we

00:50:21.910 --> 00:50:24.410
may have a better scientific
understanding of what the aging

00:50:24.410 --> 00:50:29.790
process does, and we may be able
to imitate it in a shorter time

00:50:29.790 --> 00:50:31.314
period and get them
less expensive?

00:50:31.314 --> 00:50:32.730
ADAM ROGERS: Holy
smoke, are there

00:50:32.730 --> 00:50:36.370
some people who would like
to know the answer to that.

00:50:36.370 --> 00:50:38.510
And for real, not just
as an abstract concept.

00:50:38.510 --> 00:50:40.970
But if you are a small
distiller, a craft distiller

00:50:40.970 --> 00:50:43.490
who's trying to
make a brown spirit,

00:50:43.490 --> 00:50:45.580
you don't have time to wait.

00:50:45.580 --> 00:50:47.870
You don't have enough
stock to wait for 10 years

00:50:47.870 --> 00:50:48.950
before you can start
selling things.

00:50:48.950 --> 00:50:50.420
You need to start
selling stuff now.

00:50:50.420 --> 00:50:51.500
And if you'd like
to make whiskey,

00:50:51.500 --> 00:50:52.958
you want to accelerate
the process.

00:50:52.958 --> 00:50:55.010
So without understanding
the chemistry well yet,

00:50:55.010 --> 00:50:57.720
because they don't,
one of the approaches

00:50:57.720 --> 00:50:59.470
is to use a smaller barrel.

00:50:59.470 --> 00:51:01.920
You probably know this, right.

00:51:01.920 --> 00:51:05.670
Use a smaller barrel
and you get more surface

00:51:05.670 --> 00:51:08.777
of the wood exposed to more,
relatively, of the liquid.

00:51:08.777 --> 00:51:11.110
The problem with that is you
get all the extractives out

00:51:11.110 --> 00:51:13.235
of the wood, but you don't
get any of the oxidation

00:51:13.235 --> 00:51:15.802
or esterification that
comes with just time.

00:51:15.802 --> 00:51:18.260
So people will try other tricks
to try to make that happen.

00:51:18.260 --> 00:51:22.595
There's a distillery that
actually plays heavy bass music

00:51:22.595 --> 00:51:24.470
at their barrels to try
to get the vibration,

00:51:24.470 --> 00:51:27.720
so they get more exposure
and mix it up more.

00:51:27.720 --> 00:51:29.330
There's a company
called Terressentia

00:51:29.330 --> 00:51:31.320
that says that they
have a process that

00:51:31.320 --> 00:51:35.246
combines sonification--
or sonication?

00:51:35.246 --> 00:51:37.620
Sonification I guess is if
you're playing the video game.

00:51:37.620 --> 00:51:39.310
Anyway.

00:51:39.310 --> 00:51:42.694
It combines a processing
sound with some kind

00:51:42.694 --> 00:51:44.110
of filtration
technology that they

00:51:44.110 --> 00:51:45.170
can make something taste older.

00:51:45.170 --> 00:51:45.770
I've had it.

00:51:45.770 --> 00:51:47.350
It tastes I guess fine.

00:51:47.350 --> 00:51:49.120
It didn't necessarily
taste older to me.

00:51:49.120 --> 00:51:50.680
AUDIENCE: So you're not
necessarily convinced yet?

00:51:50.680 --> 00:51:51.346
ADAM ROGERS: No.

00:51:51.346 --> 00:51:52.810
I'm not convinced of that.

00:51:52.810 --> 00:51:56.604
And I think also
what is happening

00:51:56.604 --> 00:51:58.270
is that a lot of
distillers are starting

00:51:58.270 --> 00:52:00.710
to try to say that the flavors
that you get from something

00:52:00.710 --> 00:52:03.489
that is not aged for a long time
are not a bug, but a feature.

00:52:03.489 --> 00:52:05.780
They're saying, oh no, we're
making something different

00:52:05.780 --> 00:52:06.440
here.

00:52:06.440 --> 00:52:07.840
But I know that there
are small distillers who

00:52:07.840 --> 00:52:10.340
can age for not eight years,
but some shorter amount of time

00:52:10.340 --> 00:52:12.548
and still pretty something
that's really spectacular.

00:52:12.548 --> 00:52:14.630
So there are some
methodological things going on.

00:52:14.630 --> 00:52:17.080
Whether anybody will ever
be able to say, oh OK, well

00:52:17.080 --> 00:52:21.090
here's my oldness extract--
you know, doop doop doop--

00:52:21.090 --> 00:52:22.030
and then there you go.

00:52:22.030 --> 00:52:25.120
I don't know, although that's
standard practice in some

00:52:25.120 --> 00:52:27.590
of the most traditional
drinks you can think of.

00:52:27.590 --> 00:52:33.060
If you're making cognac,
super appellation controlled,

00:52:33.060 --> 00:52:35.925
a lot of rules,
old brand-- Cognac

00:52:35.925 --> 00:52:37.592
is brandy from a
particular region, made

00:52:37.592 --> 00:52:39.800
in a particular way-- you're
allowed to add something

00:52:39.800 --> 00:52:42.030
called the-- my French is
as bad as my ancient Greek,

00:52:42.030 --> 00:52:43.880
I'm sorry-- a boise.

00:52:43.880 --> 00:52:46.850
And what it is
essentially is tannic tea.

00:52:46.850 --> 00:52:49.510
And they'll keep the same
kind of water soaking

00:52:49.510 --> 00:52:52.580
in really tannic
wood for 50 years.

00:52:52.580 --> 00:52:56.714
And they can add that
to their product.

00:52:56.714 --> 00:52:58.130
And it makes it
darker and you get

00:52:58.130 --> 00:53:02.220
a more of a big,
mellow, older flavor.

00:53:02.220 --> 00:53:03.780
And some winemakers
will do that too.

00:53:03.780 --> 00:53:07.780
They'll age in a big
steel vat, but they'll

00:53:07.780 --> 00:53:10.460
soak tea bags full of
sawdust, essentially,

00:53:10.460 --> 00:53:13.160
in there to get some of
the wood flavors into it.

00:53:13.160 --> 00:53:14.530
So Yeah, they're trying.

00:53:14.530 --> 00:53:16.470
But the specific
processes do seem

00:53:16.470 --> 00:53:18.900
to require time in the equation.

00:53:21.441 --> 00:53:23.440
AUDIENCE: So I guess as
a piggyback question off

00:53:23.440 --> 00:53:26.270
of that and a lot of the
things you mentioned,

00:53:26.270 --> 00:53:27.450
we're about the process.

00:53:27.450 --> 00:53:30.210
And you have this overarching
idea of the process.

00:53:30.210 --> 00:53:33.210
Is there a piece of that
process that's sort of yet

00:53:33.210 --> 00:53:34.040
to be invented?

00:53:34.040 --> 00:53:35.456
I mean I think a
lot of the things

00:53:35.456 --> 00:53:38.100
that you just mentioned are
ways we can use modern science

00:53:38.100 --> 00:53:41.460
and understanding to replace
or advance are quicken

00:53:41.460 --> 00:53:42.990
or make that process
more efficient.

00:53:42.990 --> 00:53:47.190
But is there some great
leap of technology

00:53:47.190 --> 00:53:48.650
waiting for booze
that will take it

00:53:48.650 --> 00:53:51.400
to the next sort of
amazing euphoric level?

00:53:51.400 --> 00:53:53.600
ADAM ROGERS: Let
me give you two.

00:53:53.600 --> 00:53:59.980
One is genetically engineering
yeast to do other stuff.

00:53:59.980 --> 00:54:02.610
So there's a
researcher in Australia

00:54:02.610 --> 00:54:06.280
named Isaac Pretorius,
and he worked on a yeast

00:54:06.280 --> 00:54:09.740
that-- I'm going to radically
simplify this, I'm sorry,

00:54:09.740 --> 00:54:10.530
this is terrible.

00:54:10.530 --> 00:54:14.450
Basically, it would take crummy
grapes and make decent wine.

00:54:14.450 --> 00:54:17.079
Because it was able to break
a particular molecular bond

00:54:17.079 --> 00:54:18.620
that was liberating
a flavor that you

00:54:18.620 --> 00:54:20.620
wanted in Sauvignon blanc
that they were growing

00:54:20.620 --> 00:54:23.990
in too hot a climate for
Sauvignon blanc, essentially.

00:54:23.990 --> 00:54:26.060
There's a woman in France
named Sylvie Dequin,

00:54:26.060 --> 00:54:27.920
and she's working
on yeasts that will

00:54:27.920 --> 00:54:30.950
make wine that tastes good,
but has lower alcohol levels.

00:54:30.950 --> 00:54:33.310
You might know this, but
especially in California wines,

00:54:33.310 --> 00:54:34.471
alcohol, ABV's creeping up.

00:54:34.471 --> 00:54:36.970
Because the yeast that they're
using and the process they're

00:54:36.970 --> 00:54:37.800
using is more efficient.

00:54:37.800 --> 00:54:39.591
They're getting more
alcohol off the sugar.

00:54:39.591 --> 00:54:41.130
So you end up with
wine that used

00:54:41.130 --> 00:54:45.580
to be 8%, 9%, you can get it
at 15, which is super high.

00:54:45.580 --> 00:54:48.400
And it does-- I mean it's
a flavor that people like,

00:54:48.400 --> 00:54:52.505
but also you're blitzed
on a glass of wine.

00:54:52.505 --> 00:54:54.380
So she's working on
yeast that won't do that.

00:54:54.380 --> 00:54:55.670
You still get the flavor,
but not the alcohol.

00:54:55.670 --> 00:54:58.030
Of course nobody in the
world-- I shouldn't say that.

00:54:58.030 --> 00:55:01.157
If you have a GMO yeast,
you can't sell it in Europe.

00:55:01.157 --> 00:55:03.740
And you'd have trouble selling
it here, you'd get controversy.

00:55:03.740 --> 00:55:07.392
So after Pretorius
made that yeast,

00:55:07.392 --> 00:55:09.600
once he knew which genes it
was, he went back and did

00:55:09.600 --> 00:55:16.810
it standard breeding, he grew
a strain up without genetically

00:55:16.810 --> 00:55:19.170
modifying it and he sells that.

00:55:19.170 --> 00:55:22.329
So there's room in the
yeast, to mess with yeast

00:55:22.329 --> 00:55:23.620
and come up with something new.

00:55:23.620 --> 00:55:30.947
The other thing
that's probably true,

00:55:30.947 --> 00:55:32.530
there's a researcher
in England, works

00:55:32.530 --> 00:55:36.510
on drugs and alcohol,
named David Nutt.

00:55:36.510 --> 00:55:40.150
And he was actually in
charge of UK drug policy

00:55:40.150 --> 00:55:42.220
until he had the
temerity to suggest

00:55:42.220 --> 00:55:44.740
that they were
over-regulating marijuana

00:55:44.740 --> 00:55:49.410
and under-regulating
alcohol, so they fired him.

00:55:49.410 --> 00:55:53.640
He says that he has a few
different compounds based

00:55:53.640 --> 00:55:55.939
on benzodiazepines
that if you take them,

00:55:55.939 --> 00:55:57.980
they make you feel exactly
the same way as having

00:55:57.980 --> 00:55:59.920
a drink or two, but
they're reversible.

00:55:59.920 --> 00:56:01.570
But they have an antidote.

00:56:01.570 --> 00:56:02.410
He says.

00:56:02.410 --> 00:56:03.485
So since it's synthehol.

00:56:06.030 --> 00:56:08.490
He's published on
the idea, and he's

00:56:08.490 --> 00:56:11.730
published sort of the
vague how it might work.

00:56:11.730 --> 00:56:13.980
And he says he's tried his
own and taken the antidote,

00:56:13.980 --> 00:56:14.730
and it worked.

00:56:14.730 --> 00:56:17.240
But as far as I've
found-- if you guys have

00:56:17.240 --> 00:56:19.691
one of these papers, tell me--
he hasn't sent me a paper.

00:56:19.691 --> 00:56:20.190
I asked him.

00:56:20.190 --> 00:56:22.180
He wouldn't talk to me, but
he sent me a couple of papers.

00:56:22.180 --> 00:56:24.250
He hasn't published the
here's the compound,

00:56:24.250 --> 00:56:25.430
here's the test, here's
how I know it works.

00:56:25.430 --> 00:56:27.475
He says he needs the funding
to do it, which is always

00:56:27.475 --> 00:56:28.670
a dicey thing for research.

00:56:28.670 --> 00:56:30.586
It's like if you guys
give me more money, then

00:56:30.586 --> 00:56:32.200
I'll give you the thing.

00:56:32.200 --> 00:56:34.200
But intriguing, right?

00:56:34.200 --> 00:56:36.090
Maybe less fun, comes
in a pill, instead of

00:56:36.090 --> 00:56:38.650
as a Corpse Reviver Number Two.

00:56:38.650 --> 00:56:45.170
But an intriguing advance
in how we get buzzed.

00:56:45.170 --> 00:56:46.680
Anything else?

00:56:46.680 --> 00:56:48.979
That's a pretty good
beat to stop on anyway.

00:56:48.979 --> 00:56:49.520
Oh, one more.

00:56:49.520 --> 00:56:50.750
Sure, go ahead.

00:56:50.750 --> 00:56:53.110
AUDIENCE: To pick
one favorite drink.

00:56:53.110 --> 00:56:56.250
ADAM ROGERS: Cocktail or--
no, see, here's the thing.

00:56:56.250 --> 00:56:59.290
I'm the most annoying person
in the world to drink with now.

00:56:59.290 --> 00:57:03.270
I'm so unpleasant
now, not because-- I'm

00:57:03.270 --> 00:57:07.060
working really hard on not being
judgey about people's drinks.

00:57:07.060 --> 00:57:10.570
I'm getting there, I'm evolving.

00:57:10.570 --> 00:57:12.560
Is that really a
chocolate martini, really?

00:57:12.560 --> 00:57:14.143
OK, if you like the
chocolate martini,

00:57:14.143 --> 00:57:16.030
you can have the
chocolate martini.

00:57:16.030 --> 00:57:19.350
But I get that question
and I get all contextual.

00:57:19.350 --> 00:57:22.399
I'm like, well, am
I-- is it hot out?

00:57:22.399 --> 00:57:23.440
Is it the end of the day?

00:57:23.440 --> 00:57:25.930
Is it evening, or am
I about to go out,

00:57:25.930 --> 00:57:27.740
or is this after dinner?

00:57:27.740 --> 00:57:30.317
The truth is that the thing
that kind of got me into this--

00:57:30.317 --> 00:57:32.650
though there are a lot of
things that got me into this--

00:57:32.650 --> 00:57:34.570
was single malt whisky.

00:57:34.570 --> 00:57:41.090
And that's still I think,
along with with the Shinkansen

00:57:41.090 --> 00:57:43.049
and rocket ships, I
think single malt whisky

00:57:43.049 --> 00:57:45.090
may be one of the pinnacles
of human achievement.

00:57:45.090 --> 00:57:46.830
So it's probably that.

00:57:49.982 --> 00:57:51.190
Thank you very much you guys.

00:57:51.190 --> 00:57:52.148
I really appreciate it.

00:57:52.148 --> 00:57:55.440
[APPLAUSE]
