1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:03,130
So when you're coming back from
all these summits and all these,

2
00:00:03,190 --> 00:00:04,810
this time at altitude,

3
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:10,050
what has actually happened to your body
that causes you to be really depleted

4
00:00:10,931 --> 00:00:12,570
for six months? Like what? What's,

5
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:17,230
what's happening other than the fact that
you were at high altitude, low oxygen,

6
00:00:17,231 --> 00:00:18,400
like what's taking place?

7
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:21,470
So one of the things that happened to
high altitude that you don't really think

8
00:00:21,471 --> 00:00:24,080
about too much,
which is your body's not getting,

9
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:28,010
so the air actually has just as much
oxygen in it as it does at sea level.

10
00:00:28,011 --> 00:00:31,190
But the air is less dense.
So that means as you breathe in the air,

11
00:00:31,191 --> 00:00:34,520
you're literally getting less oxygen
into your blood. It's less dense,

12
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:38,750
it's less nitrogen, the pressure
changes, right? So at the high altitude,

13
00:00:38,751 --> 00:00:41,330
it's actually the pressure that's
changing. It's not less oxygen,

14
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:43,730
there's just as much oxygen,
but in a less dense form.

15
00:00:43,731 --> 00:00:45,380
So in the same volume of breath,

16
00:00:45,381 --> 00:00:47,990
you're getting less actual
o two into your blood.

17
00:00:47,991 --> 00:00:52,430
And what are you at a higher altitude, I
guess? Uh, carbon dioxide. Is that right?

18
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:57,240
Yeah. I'm not a doctor. Like I said, all
I know is you're getting less oxygen. Um,

19
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:58,640
you're getting less oxygen,
your body.

20
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,970
So what ends up happening is your
muscles of course need oxygen to perform.

21
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:06,050
So normally if I'm in a, you know, when
I'm in my most elite physical shape,

22
00:01:06,051 --> 00:01:06,201
you know,

23
00:01:06,201 --> 00:01:09,620
I resting heart rate during a professional
triathlon career of like 35 getting

24
00:01:09,621 --> 00:01:10,251
out of bed,
you know,

25
00:01:10,251 --> 00:01:12,950
38 low enough that if you weren't a
professional athlete and you went to a

26
00:01:12,951 --> 00:01:14,900
doctor with a heart rate of
35, they'd be like, oh my God,

27
00:01:14,901 --> 00:01:17,500
like you're going to die.
There's something wrong with
you. But like that's also,

28
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:21,470
you know, a key marker of elite
performance. You know, that of course. Um,

29
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:25,820
but uh,
what happens is your body can't PR,

30
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:28,490
your body's getting so little auction,
even as your blood is acclimatizing,

31
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:32,270
you're sleeping with a resting heart
rate at altitude on Everest at like 9,000

32
00:01:32,271 --> 00:01:36,050
beats per minute. So, you know,
that's pretty elevated heart rate,

33
00:01:36,051 --> 00:01:39,950
24 hours a day. And for, in my
case, for 139 days straight.

34
00:01:39,951 --> 00:01:42,700
So essentially you're just
career heart. It's just like
cook, Cook, Cook, Cook, Cook,

35
00:01:42,701 --> 00:01:44,840
Cook, Cook, Cook, Cook, Cook,
Cook up and cook even at rest.

36
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:47,820
And so what that does to your
body in terms of, you know,

37
00:01:47,821 --> 00:01:51,380
it throws your hormones around it
obviously you lose body weight, body fat,

38
00:01:51,381 --> 00:01:55,390
body composition, changes, all of those
things really shift and happen, uh,

39
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:57,560
in a pretty intense way.
So coming back,

40
00:01:57,561 --> 00:02:00,530
like actually just getting your heart
rate back down, getting your, you know,

41
00:02:00,531 --> 00:02:04,970
a pair of simple nervous system to just
relax and stress free and all that kind

42
00:02:04,971 --> 00:02:06,200
of stuff.
It takes a while for sure.

43
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:09,950
So what do you do to help yourself
recover when you come back?

44
00:02:09,951 --> 00:02:12,380
Because there specific kinds of
food that you eat or supplements

45
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:17,480
sick. Um, you know, I'll
start the few different things
that I find to be the work.

46
00:02:17,481 --> 00:02:19,040
Well, one sleep. I mean,

47
00:02:19,041 --> 00:02:22,970
I think that sleep in our culture in
general is really underrated. I think,

48
00:02:22,971 --> 00:02:25,640
you know, if you go in the
corporate world and everyone's like,

49
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:29,960
I pulled this all night or I work in 120
hours a week, I this, I that or whatever.

50
00:02:29,961 --> 00:02:30,800
Like,
you know,

51
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:33,320
I'm telling you a story about pushing
through the night and going 32 hours

52
00:02:33,321 --> 00:02:35,750
straight. There's a time and a
place for big pushes without sleep.

53
00:02:35,751 --> 00:02:40,190
But like we are not built
to do that sustainably, um,
in any way, shape or form.

54
00:02:40,191 --> 00:02:43,100
So in my training, when I'm training
for these things, I prioritize sleep.

55
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:45,860
I prioritize taking a nap,
the same thing when I'm recovering.

56
00:02:45,861 --> 00:02:48,350
So really making sure I get
that sleep is the most for me,

57
00:02:48,351 --> 00:02:51,560
the most natural way to recover.
And top of that soft tissue work.

58
00:02:51,561 --> 00:02:54,920
I'm a huge believer in massage,
um, as well as chiropractor.

59
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:58,310
I've been going to a chiropractor since
I was a little kid and to me that makes

60
00:02:58,311 --> 00:03:01,270
a big difference. Just have everything in
alignment, everything kind of, you know,

61
00:03:01,271 --> 00:03:05,500
working well, uh, efficiently in my body.
Um, and then yeah, supplements, you know,

62
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:09,040
definitely reducing inflammation.
So for me, gut health is huge. Um,

63
00:03:09,041 --> 00:03:11,590
so getting those probiotics, getting
the right stuff in, you know,

64
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,730
it's easy to have,
you know,

65
00:03:12,731 --> 00:03:15,730
that leaky gut or things where you're
not getting nutrition observed,

66
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:19,150
absorbed properly. And I think we
all in various states, you know,

67
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:21,720
you deal with that, you know, that
the standard American diet for sure.

68
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:23,800
What leads to that for a lot of people.
Um,

69
00:03:23,801 --> 00:03:27,610
so getting that nutrition clean and
right. Um, so yeah, sleep, rest, recovery,

70
00:03:27,611 --> 00:03:30,480
nutrition. Um, and then, you
know, I've definitely been, uh,

71
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,080
taken a lot of supplements
through my life.

72
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:35,800
I err more towards the
whole food supplements these
days, but I find, you know,

73
00:03:35,801 --> 00:03:40,030
things like Tumeric that really reduce
inflammation. Um, and, uh, you know,

74
00:03:40,031 --> 00:03:43,180
magnesium definitely helps a lot.
So there's a few things that I,

75
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:44,920
that I take daily,
but a really,

76
00:03:44,921 --> 00:03:48,040
I think sleep and in a clean
diet will goes a long way.
