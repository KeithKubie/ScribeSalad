00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:03.380
(snare sound as each pops up)

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:06.480
(film reel noise)

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:10.940
VOICEOVER: You loved the Power Rangers when you were a kid.

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:13.400
Now, take a trip down memory lane,

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:14.500
And realize...

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:16.980
What was I thinking!?

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.740
*cheesy music plays*

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.260
This is terrible!

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:24.340
Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers: THE MOVIE

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:27.780
Before they try to make a grounded reboot

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:30.460
out of rainbow-suited teenagers karate-fighting a grumblebee

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:32.840
GRUMBLEBEE: Now taste my poison venom!

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:33.740
*evil laugh*

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.480
Revisit the first Ranger project that didn't rely on archive Japanese footage

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.520
Which only makes it worse.

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:43.300
Now what's their excuse?

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.600
You know it's bad when the rapping pumpkin looks better than your CGI robot.

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.520
RAPPING PUMPKIN: Ooh, you Rangers make me Mad!

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:50.640
Waking me up with a rap that Bad!

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:56.840
Follow the EXACT SAME FORMULA that cranked out over 800 episodes of television.

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:58.680
Where Rita summons a monster...

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:02.240
The Power Rangers fight their minions hand-to-hand...

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:03.960
Someone gets really big...

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:05.860
MONSTER: I feel big again!

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:08.920
And the Rangers morph into a Zord to save the day.

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.920
ALL RANGERS: Ninja Mega-Zord Power Up!

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.680
But this time... everybody's parents get drugged into committing mass suicide!

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:17.280
PARENTS: Lead to our doom...

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.800
KID: I can't hold them back. What are we gonna do!?

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.320
VO: Whoa... that got dark...

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:26.200
Return to the 90s, an era so extreme, every group from the high school

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.220
to the fire department has their own competitive skydiving team,

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.220
and get pumped, because all your favorite teenagers with attitude have returned.

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:35.060
Uh. Minus the attitude.

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.380
"Six extraordinary teenagers"

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.700
Also, none of the actors were actually teenagers.

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.880
Aaand...three of them are actually replacing your favorites from the show

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:45.020
FRAUD: I'm a fraud.

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.620
Still. Three of your favorite non-teenagers without attitude,

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:51.260
and no active contract disputes, are here!

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.620
Like Tommy, the only one you care about,

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:55.060
KID: Yeah! Go Tommy!

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:56.220
MONSTER: Yeah!

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:58.340
Kimberley, the damsel in distress,

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:01.000
*Kimberley screaming*

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:02.460
*evil laughter*

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.060
KIMBERLEY: I'm burning up in here!

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.640
And Billy, the nerd who was bullied so badly he walked off the show

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.560
YOST: I was worried that I might take my own life.

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.240
Dude. Again, dark.

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.780
When Sydney Austr...aaangel Grove, is attacked

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.680
by the news of Freddy Krueger as slime monster,

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.660
FREDDY: Welcome to my nightmare. *evil laugh*
SLIME: Welcome to my nightmare. *evil laugh*

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:26.680
The Rangers will travel to Sydney, Austr...aanother planet,

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.640
to gain the power of the ninjetti, which I believe is Italian for ninja.

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.760
An all new way to make it easier to swap the actors out with their stunt doubles.

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.220
Now they'll come together to save the universe from evil,

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.280
with a fresh set of action figures!

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.200
dumb new accessories,

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:45.500
PINK: Pteradactyl Thunder-whip!

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.040
BLUE: Mega-stinger!

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.860
YELLOW: Activating power beam.

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:54.260
VO: and a new, awful looking Zord, complete with emergency junk-kicking action.

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:56.440
*groan*

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.620
Ooh, right in the Bulk and Skull.

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:03.480
So gear up for this feature-length episode of what's basically a live action cartoon,

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:05.960
that was so forgettable, the show ignored it,

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:08.720
and did their own episode about ninja powers instead.

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:13.020
NINJOR: You now possess the power of Ninjor, deep within your souls.

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:16.620
But at least it gave more fuel to every Power Ranger's fan's most important question:

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.140
Are Tommy and Kimberley hooking up, or what?

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:25.220
*romantic ballad plays*

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.880
Now that Jason's out of the picture, they have to be. Right?

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.780
So vague.

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.300
Starring MMA actually kick your ass,

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:34.960
Pinky and the Brain,

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.120
the Sorceress from the He-Man movie,

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:38.880
Fred Sav-ish,

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.060
Belloq from Raiders of the Lost Ark...

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:42.760
seriously needed a paycheck,

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.720
pointless back hand-springs,

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:50.680
PINK: Seeya!

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:53.260
BLUE: Right behind ya, Kimberley

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:55.000
Ay yi yi yis

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:00.820
ALPHA 5: Ay yi yi yi...yi yi yi yi...yi yi yi...yi yi yi yi yi yi...

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:01.560
Ee-ya!s

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.640
VARIOUS: Ee-ya! Ee-ya! Ee-ya! Ee-ya!

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:05.940
ALL: Ee-ya!

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:07.240
Whooshes

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:10.060
*whoosh, swish, whoosh, swish swish whoosh*

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:11.060
WHITE: Let's go get the other one.

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:15.140
*whoosh whoosh whoosh, whooshlewhooshle whooshlewhoosh*

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:19.080
*more over the top whooshing*

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:20.240
*whoosh*

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:23.760
And...the more you know

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:26.380
Teenage Morphin' Ninja Jaegers

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:31.140
*sniffs deeply*

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:38.120
MONSTER: Smells like....teenagers.

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.760
So...cloves and Ax body spray?

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:41.520
Eugh.

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:45.100
Hey, Screen Junkies! Want more 90s nostalgia?

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:48.260
then take a trip back down memory lane, to a tale as old as time...

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.280
for our honest trailer of Disney's animated Beauty and the Beast.

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:53.260
Or, if it's still Morphin' time,

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:57.140
click the box on the right and watch our interview with the cast of the new Power Rangers movie.

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:58.800
Ay yi yi yi yi!

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:01.120
It's Morphin' time.

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:05.460
How many Lowes could Rob Lowe rob, if Rob Lowe could rob Lowes?

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:08.500
This milk is rated 'S', for spoiled.

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:10.320
You're a turd-biscuit.

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:13.840
Harry Pooter and the Chamber of Secret Farts

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:17.060
