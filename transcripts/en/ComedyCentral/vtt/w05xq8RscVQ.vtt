00:00:02.668 --> 00:00:04.570
with some talented comedians.

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:08.274
J Smitty, Reece Cotton,
and Jay Are Adams.

00:00:08.375 --> 00:00:09.175
All right.

00:00:09.275 --> 00:00:10.776
Let's talk comedy, man.

00:00:10.876 --> 00:00:12.678
What do you guys think about
the comedy scene here in Boston?

00:00:12.778 --> 00:00:14.246
I actually like it, you know.

00:00:14.346 --> 00:00:16.315 line:0%
It's just a hop, skip and a jump
to Rhode Island, Connecticut,

00:00:16.415 --> 00:00:19.985 line:0%
and even New York, and even
New Hampshire has a little, you

00:00:20.085 --> 00:00:21.454
know, comedy scene.

00:00:21.554 --> 00:00:24.124
So we're perfectly located,
you know, to go all over.

00:00:24.224 --> 00:00:26.860
This is probably one of the
best places to start comedy,

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:27.994
because it's a good mix.

00:00:28.094 --> 00:00:29.696
Like, there's a lot
of college kids here.

00:00:29.796 --> 00:00:31.197
So it's a weird kind of thing
we've got, where we've got

00:00:31.297 --> 00:00:33.065
like, some of the
smartest people here,

00:00:33.165 --> 00:00:35.134
but we've got the old
townies, so we've got some

00:00:35.234 --> 00:00:36.602
of the dumbest people here.

00:00:36.702 --> 00:00:37.337
OK.

00:00:37.437 --> 00:00:38.505
So this city has a lot--

00:00:38.605 --> 00:00:40.072
a lot of range.

00:00:40.172 --> 00:00:42.709
How do the comedy scene that's
outside of the comedy clubs

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:43.643
here?

00:00:43.743 --> 00:00:44.944
People will start
their own rooms.

00:00:45.044 --> 00:00:46.178
They'll talk to the
bar and be like, hey,

00:00:46.278 --> 00:00:47.012
we'll do a comedy night here.

00:00:47.112 --> 00:00:48.615
It might start free.

00:00:48.715 --> 00:00:50.282
If it gets good, maybe they can
start charging people $5, $10,

00:00:50.382 --> 00:00:51.551
$15.

00:00:51.651 --> 00:00:53.019
So it starts as just
you work with a bar,

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:54.887
and then it becomes something
that it's a good club.

00:00:54.987 --> 00:00:57.023
OK do you guys frequent
those spots a lot?

00:00:57.123 --> 00:00:58.057
We frequent a lot.

00:00:58.157 --> 00:00:58.991
A couple of nights, sometimes.

00:00:59.091 --> 00:01:00.159
There you go.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:01.894
That's why we don't
really need a huge club

00:01:01.994 --> 00:01:04.096
or a huge casino,
because we have

00:01:04.196 --> 00:01:07.032
a lot of people that really
love comedy in the small rooms,

00:01:07.132 --> 00:01:08.301
and it works.

00:01:08.401 --> 00:01:10.202
The people-- people
here love to laugh.

00:01:10.302 --> 00:01:11.370
That's what I like about Boston.

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:13.539
They come out ready to laugh.

00:01:13.639 --> 00:01:15.208
Bombing moments.

00:01:15.308 --> 00:01:16.209
I've been--

00:01:16.309 --> 00:01:17.577
I've been lighted early.

00:01:17.677 --> 00:01:18.410
KEVIN HART: OK.

00:01:18.511 --> 00:01:19.379
[laughter]

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:21.380
Like, real early.

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:22.982
Did they flick it?

00:01:23.082 --> 00:01:24.650
When they flick the lights,
that's when it's getting bad.

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.385
When you see the guy in the
back just looking at you.

00:01:26.485 --> 00:01:27.887
It ain't been, like,
five minutes yet.

00:01:27.987 --> 00:01:31.090
He told me 15.

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:32.659
I've gotten the early light.

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.095 line:0%
I've also bombed and just took
it, and was like, I don't care.

00:01:36.195 --> 00:01:38.030 line:0%
I'm just going to get through,
say what I have to say.

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.100
And I sat down, and then the
owner got up and was like,

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.736
yeah, you know, she's actually
a really good comedian.

00:01:43.836 --> 00:01:45.672
And I'm just like,
wait a minute.

00:01:45.772 --> 00:01:46.339
Oh, God.

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:47.273
Not good.

00:01:47.373 --> 00:01:48.541
Wait a minute, I don't--

00:01:48.641 --> 00:01:50.209
that just made it worse.

00:01:50.309 --> 00:01:51.744
What's the end game?

00:01:51.844 --> 00:01:53.713
Like here's where I am, but
here's where I want to be.

00:01:53.813 --> 00:01:56.449
Well, first, I need to get
my brakes fixed on my car.

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.452
So like, just $100 for that.

00:01:59.552 --> 00:02:00.920
To me, this is a
big stepping stone.

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.990
This is a big opportunity
for us, and you know,

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.025
we've been dreaming
of meeting you.

00:02:06.125 --> 00:02:06.792
You know?

00:02:06.892 --> 00:02:08.227
I was watching Netflix.

00:02:08.327 --> 00:02:12.598
I saw "Laugh At My Pain" I
saw how big that crowd was,

00:02:12.698 --> 00:02:13.799
and I was just
like, I want that.

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.334
You want that.
There you go.

00:02:15.434 --> 00:02:16.702
And I was like-- and that's
as far as my dreams have gone.

00:02:16.802 --> 00:02:17.704
KEVIN HART: As far as you saw.

00:02:17.804 --> 00:02:19.005
Yeah, as far as I see.

00:02:19.105 --> 00:02:20.406
We're at Slade's Bar
and Grille tonight.

00:02:20.506 --> 00:02:21.774
I can't wait.
I'm excited.

00:02:21.874 --> 00:02:23.542
I think you're going to
make Boston proud, man.

00:02:23.642 --> 00:02:24.878
Get up there and kill tonight.
