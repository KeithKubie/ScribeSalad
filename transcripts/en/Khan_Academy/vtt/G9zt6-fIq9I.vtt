00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.239
- [Tutor] What we're
going to do in this video

00:00:01.239 --> 00:00:03.709
is try to look at as
many scenarios as we can,

00:00:03.709 --> 00:00:07.265
where an object is exhibiting
uniform circular motion,

00:00:07.265 --> 00:00:10.873
it's traveling around in a
circle at a constant speed

00:00:10.873 --> 00:00:13.262
and what we wanna do is think about

00:00:13.262 --> 00:00:15.085
why is it staying on the circle,

00:00:15.085 --> 00:00:17.972
what centripetal force
is keeping the object

00:00:17.972 --> 00:00:21.587
from just going off in a straight line?

00:00:21.587 --> 00:00:24.538
So in this first scenario,
I have some type of a wheel,

00:00:24.538 --> 00:00:27.441
maybe a ball attached to a string,

00:00:27.441 --> 00:00:30.653
that's attached to a peg
at the center of the table

00:00:30.653 --> 00:00:35.173
and this wheel is moving in
a circle at a constant speed,

00:00:35.173 --> 00:00:38.403
so it's moving in this
circle at a constant speed,

00:00:38.403 --> 00:00:40.934
so pause this video, think
about all of the forces

00:00:40.934 --> 00:00:44.868
that are acting on this wheel
and which of those forces,

00:00:44.868 --> 00:00:47.352
or maybe some combination of those forces,

00:00:47.352 --> 00:00:50.233
that are actually acting
as the centripetal force,

00:00:50.233 --> 00:00:54.006
that are keeping the wheel on the circle.

00:00:54.006 --> 00:00:56.835
Alright, now let's work
through this together,

00:00:56.835 --> 00:00:59.579
so there's a couple of
forces, that aren't impacting

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.847
the wheels staying on the circle
so much, but they're there,

00:01:03.847 --> 00:01:05.310
for example, you're definitely gonna have

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:06.213
the force of gravity,

00:01:06.213 --> 00:01:09.929
we're assuming we're dealing
with this wheel on a planet,

00:01:09.929 --> 00:01:12.346
so we'll denote its magnitude

00:01:14.036 --> 00:01:15.536
as capital F sub g

00:01:16.552 --> 00:01:19.391
and then this is its direction
with this orange arrow,

00:01:19.391 --> 00:01:21.097
so that's the force of gravity

00:01:21.097 --> 00:01:25.018
and the reason why the wheel
is not accelerating downward

00:01:25.018 --> 00:01:26.689
is that we have that table there

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:29.837
and so the table is exerting

00:01:29.837 --> 00:01:31.223
a normal force on the wheel,

00:01:31.223 --> 00:01:34.090
that counteracts the gravitational force,

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:38.070
so the magnitude there would
be the force, the normal force

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.141
and these are going to
be the same magnitude,

00:01:40.141 --> 00:01:42.833
they're just going to be
in different directions,

00:01:42.833 --> 00:01:44.334
just let me see if I can draw this arrow

00:01:44.334 --> 00:01:48.824
a little bit taller, but
what else is going on?

00:01:48.824 --> 00:01:51.118
Well, as you can imagine,
if this string wasn't here,

00:01:51.118 --> 00:01:53.240
the wheel really would
go off in a straight line

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.704
and eventually fall off of the table

00:01:55.704 --> 00:01:59.534
and so the string is
providing some inward force,

00:01:59.534 --> 00:02:02.701
that keeps the wheel going in a circle

00:02:04.061 --> 00:02:06.106
and that inward force, that pulling force,

00:02:06.106 --> 00:02:09.239
we would consider that
to be the tension force,

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.725
so I'll just draw it like that

00:02:11.725 --> 00:02:14.597
and its magnitude is F sub T

00:02:14.597 --> 00:02:17.626
and in this situation, it is
providing that inward force,

00:02:17.626 --> 00:02:19.497
so that is the centripetal force,

00:02:19.497 --> 00:02:23.831
so we could say the
magnitude of the tension,

00:02:23.831 --> 00:02:26.055
the tension force, the pulling force,

00:02:26.055 --> 00:02:29.069
is going to be equal to
the centripetal force,

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:32.304
in this case, they're actually
the exact same vector,

00:02:32.304 --> 00:02:34.167
so I can even write it like this,

00:02:34.167 --> 00:02:36.360
this is the centripetal force vector,

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.480
it's the tension in that rope,

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.893
that keeps us going in a circle.

00:02:40.893 --> 00:02:42.976
Let's do another example,

00:02:45.273 --> 00:02:47.510
so this one is similar,

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:50.679
but I have a few more dimensions going on,

00:02:50.679 --> 00:02:53.117
here this is a classic
example from physics,

00:02:53.117 --> 00:02:55.900
I have a string attached to the ceiling

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.546
and I have some type
of a ball or a pendulum

00:02:58.546 --> 00:03:02.404
and it's swinging in a
circular, in a circular motion

00:03:02.404 --> 00:03:05.541
right over here at a constant speed,

00:03:05.541 --> 00:03:09.324
so the center of its circle
would be right around there,

00:03:09.324 --> 00:03:10.568
so once again pause this video,

00:03:10.568 --> 00:03:13.151
think about all of the forces on that ball

00:03:13.151 --> 00:03:15.187
and we're not gonna talk too
much about air resistance,

00:03:15.187 --> 00:03:18.352
let's assume that these are
in vacuum chambers for now

00:03:18.352 --> 00:03:20.307
and then think about,
well, which of those forces

00:03:20.307 --> 00:03:23.224
is providing the centripetal force?

00:03:24.402 --> 00:03:25.834
Well, just like in the last video,

00:03:25.834 --> 00:03:28.275
there's definitely some force of gravity,

00:03:28.275 --> 00:03:32.122
so you have that vector right over there

00:03:32.122 --> 00:03:35.048
and so its magnitude is F sub g

00:03:35.048 --> 00:03:38.212
and you also have the
string holding up the ball

00:03:38.212 --> 00:03:41.843
and so you're gonna have its pulling force

00:03:41.843 --> 00:03:43.760
on, so this would be...

00:03:44.936 --> 00:03:46.997
the magnitude here would be F sub T,

00:03:46.997 --> 00:03:49.088
this is the tension force,

00:03:49.088 --> 00:03:50.876
but what's counteracting the gravity

00:03:50.876 --> 00:03:53.734
and what's keeping us going in a circle?

00:03:53.734 --> 00:03:55.690
Well, in this situation,
we can think about

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:58.410
the different components of the tension,

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:00.187
because this is going off at an angle,

00:04:00.187 --> 00:04:04.354
so if we break down that vector
in the vertical direction,

00:04:05.232 --> 00:04:07.969
so if we take the vertical component,

00:04:07.969 --> 00:04:11.087
or the y component of the tension force,

00:04:11.087 --> 00:04:12.551
it would look something like this,

00:04:12.551 --> 00:04:14.468
we could call that F Ty

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:19.021
for the y component, this
would be its magnitude

00:04:19.021 --> 00:04:21.653
and that is what is
counteracting the gravity,

00:04:21.653 --> 00:04:24.213
why the ball is not accelerating downwards

00:04:24.213 --> 00:04:28.380
and if we think about the
x component of the tension,

00:04:29.741 --> 00:04:33.182
that would be this right over here,

00:04:33.182 --> 00:04:35.235
this is the x component of the tension,

00:04:35.235 --> 00:04:37.460
just to be clear where
I'm getting this from,

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:40.375
so this would be F tension
in the x direction,

00:04:40.375 --> 00:04:42.263
that would be its magnitude

00:04:42.263 --> 00:04:45.339
and that is what is providing
the centripetal force

00:04:45.339 --> 00:04:49.506
or that is the centripetal
force, so in this situation,

00:04:50.566 --> 00:04:53.643
the component of our
tension in the x direction

00:04:53.643 --> 00:04:56.555
and let me just denote that as a vector,

00:04:56.555 --> 00:04:59.055
that is our centripetal force,

00:05:00.425 --> 00:05:01.947
that's what keeps the ball

00:05:01.947 --> 00:05:04.665
from just going straight off
in a direction like that.
