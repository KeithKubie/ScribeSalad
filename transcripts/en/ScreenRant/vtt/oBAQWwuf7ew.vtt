00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:12.200
One of the most well-known characters in comic
book history, Superman is also one of the

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:13.200
oldest.

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.770
Created by writer Jerry Siegel and artist
Joe Shuster, Superman first appeared in Action

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:23.430
Comics number 1 – all the way back in June
of 1938, setting the stage for countless superheroes

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.950
that followed in the next seventy-eight years
(and counting).

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:31.610
While certain elements of Superman’s backstory
and powers remain the same nearly eight decades

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:35.790
later, different writers and artists also
brought with them changes to the hero’s

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:36.790
mythology.

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:41.180
Some carried forward, adding to Superman canon,
while others were set aside and abandoned

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:42.180
when they were no longer needed.

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.370
While there is not one “official” Superman,
though fans will likely have their favorites,

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.560
DC Comics has attempted to refine the Man
of Steel over the years – delving deeper

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:55.770
and deeper into why the Kryptonian hero can
do the various “super” things he does.

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:01.899
Superman’s powers are no secret but how,
exactly, science (albeit science fiction)

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:05.470
contributes to Kal-El’s super-human abilities
is less well-known.

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:09.580
This might be review for the biggest Superman
lovers but, for fans who want to know more

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:14.119
about the Big Blue Boy Scout, we’re digging
into the god-like biology of Earth’s iconic

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:24.229
Kryptonian for our latest docu series video:
the real science behind Superman’s coolest

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:27.119
powers.

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:28.119
Super Fuel

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:33.350
Originally, the reason for Superman's abilities
was not explicitly detailed – other than

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:35.570
stating Superman is an alien.

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:40.219
However, as the Superman character developed
over the years, DC writers attempted to provide

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:45.110
real world explanations for the hero's super
powers, settling on the idea that Superman

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:50.020
receives his abilities from stored-up solar
energy - via Earth's yellow sun.

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:54.880
Where Kryptonians lived under the harsh conditions
of a red sun, known as Rao, Superman's body

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.640
is able to metabolize energy from Earth’s
yellow sun (similar to how humans metabolize

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.539
energy from their food) - then uses that energy
to fuel his various super powers (with the

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:07.499
added benefit of slowing the kryptonian's
aging).

00:02:07.499 --> 00:02:13.100
Like most life forms, Superman can also store
excess energy for later use – which is then

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.250
used to fuel many of Kal-El’s powers

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:19.819
However, the hero’s solar-powered abilities
also come with drawbacks.

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:25.019
Should the Kryptonian over-use his super powers,
without a chance to recharge, he can exhaust

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:29.099
all of his reserve energy - becoming weakened
and even vulnerable to injury.

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:33.739
Similarly, red sunlight has a similar effect
- blocking Kal-El’s ability to absorb yellow

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:37.790
sun and, consequently, suppressing his superhuman
abilities.

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.140
Of course, the opposite can be true as well.

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:45.159
In certain situations, Superman can even choose
to over-charge his cells with solar energy,

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:47.980
granting him enhanced healing and additional
abilities.

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.769
In particular, The Death of Superman saw Kal-El's
critically injured body returned to the Fortress

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:58.019
of Solitude and placed inside the regeneration
matrix to be rejuvenated - a feat that required

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:03.780
both the hero's inherent solar regeneration
and advanced Kryptonian technology.

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.409
Super Strength, Speed, and Perception

00:03:06.409 --> 00:03:11.590
Initially described as "more powerful than
a locomotive and faster than a speeding bullet,"

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:14.769
Kal-El's super abilities have increased significantly
over the years.

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:20.180
Yet, Superman's strength, endurance, and speed,
are derived from stored solar energy - providing

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:25.480
fuel to his inherently dense molecular structure
- allowing Kal-El to move with superhuman

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.700
force (all without injury to himself).

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:33.159
Still, for that reason, Superman's raw power
is incalculable - since his strength and speed

00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:37.909
is not a uniform benchmark and can be diminished
or amplified by other conditions and external

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:41.769
factors – especially the amount of solar
energy he has stored.

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:46.590
That energy also affords the Kryptonian enhanced
reflexes and a relative perception of time

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:49.360
- making him a dangerous hand-to-hand combatant.

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:53.050
This means that the Man of Steel can quickly
react to the actions of others as well as

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:55.760
assess his environment much quicker than humans.

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:00.230
This isn't to say that Superman necessarily
slows time or perceives normal time differently

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:04.840
than humans by default but, at the very least,
the hero is capable of heightened in-the-moment

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:09.319
focus, allowing him to rapidly process and
react to external stimuli.

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:14.290
One of Superman's most iconic super powers,
freeze breath might seem like an exception

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:19.139
to Kal-El’s solar-powered skill set; yet,
the super breath is actually an extension

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:22.920
of the hero’s strength - thanks to the real-life
Joule–Thomson effect.

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:27.190
The effect shows that compressed air, rapidly
pushed through a restricted opening rapidly

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:29.840
reduces the overall temperature of the burst.

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:34.500
This means Superman, who can forcefully exhale
at high velocity and pressure, could turn

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:41.690
the burst into an arctic blast - by intentionally
directing the air through pursed lips.

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:43.160
Bio-Electric Aura

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:48.060
Kal-El has only been shown to possess telekinetic
abilities on a few isolated occasions; however,

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:53.700
it is largely accepted that Superman’s store
of solar energy also affords him a bio-electric

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:58.410
aura that allows him to manipulate electromagnetic
fields – an ability that has come to be

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:01.260
known as “tactile telekinesis.”

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:05.890
Tactile telekinesis attempts to explain why
Superman can pick up a jetliner by the nose

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:10.759
without the entire airplane buckling from
the pull of gravity on the tail-end (for example)

00:05:10.759 --> 00:05:15.130
- asserting that the hero was surrounded by
a solar-powered telekinetic aura that engulfed

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:20.350
anything he touched - resulting in both physical
and electromagnetic field manipulation to

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:24.920
evenly distribute force across an object through
only one point of contact.

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:29.220
Superman's "flight" was, originally, an extension
of his strength - as the super-strong hero

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:31.790
could just leap higher and farther than humans.

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:36.220
However, viewers who watched Zack Snyder’s
Man of Steel will see that jumping alone isn't

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:40.910
enough to keep Superman airborne (at least
in the modern movie universe); instead, Superman

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:45.930
is shown lifting and spinning ice particles
before erupting into the sky - implying that

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:51.240
he isn't just pushing off or jumping, he's
consciously using his bioelectric aura to

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:55.390
manipulating surrounding gravitational forces
– tactile telekinesis in practice.

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:59.400
In the film’s final fight, Zod is also shown
to levitate debris and other items when he

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:03.930
learns to fly – indicating that when Kryptonians
take flight, that flight unleashes energy

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:06.340
onto the surrounding area and objects.

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:10.800
As a result, the levitation seen in Man of
Steel is an example of a complex gravitational

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:15.590
field manipulation that allows Kryptonians
on Earth to outright defy gravity, hover above

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:20.690
the ground, and even lift heavy objects into
the sky – all thanks to repurposing of solar

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:23.370
energy.

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:24.610
Invulnerability

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:28.700
Certain versions of Superman also credit his
"bio-electric aura" as a contributor to the

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:33.140
hero’s invulnerability – as the bio-electric
aura also surrounds objects and organisms

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:37.690
in Superman's immediate vicinity, making it
possible for Kal-El to protect Lois Lane,

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:42.640
for example, from a deadly explosion without
having to cover every square inch of her body.

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:48.110
The strength and range of Superman's bio-electric
aura varies but, in an extreme case, enabled

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:49.980
the hero to survive a supernova.

00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:54.360
Still, the even though justifications for
Kryptonian invulnerability can vary, most

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:56.950
have one thing in common: solar energy.

00:06:56.950 --> 00:07:01.400
As previously detailed, Krypton's red sun
caused the kryptonians to evolve under extremely

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:05.490
harsh conditions, in comparison to Earth,
affording the extra-terrestrial race with

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:10.400
an extremely dense molecular structure - including
near-unbreakable cellular bonds.

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:15.400
For that reason, the Man of Steel is invulnerable
to injury on Earth - be it piercing, puncture,

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:16.810
impact, and incineration.

00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:21.300
Still, absorbing yellow sun is necessary for
Superman to maintain this invulnerability

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:27.160
- as metabolized solar energy fuels and strengthens
those near-unbreakable cellular bonds.

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:31.780
If Kal-El depletes his solar stores or is
exposed to kryptonite materials, he becomes

00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:35.980
increasingly vulnerable to attack and injury
as well.

00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:37.360
Heat Vision

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:42.110
Since Superman's powers are derived by absorbing
and metabolizing solar energy then using that

00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:45.710
energy to fuel super strength, speed, and
other enhanced abilities, one of the more

00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:50.370
literal examples of this process is Superman's
heat vision - which allows the hero to emit

00:07:50.370 --> 00:07:54.800
stored solar energy as directed beams of focused
heat through his eyes.

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:58.270
The beams have varied in precision and strength
throughout the years but have been shown to

00:07:58.270 --> 00:08:02.990
reach objects over a hundred feet away and,
conversely, feature surgical accuracy - down

00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:04.620
to microscopic levels.

00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:08.600
Depending on the situation and intensity of
the emission, Superman's heat vision can be

00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:13.361
invisible to the naked eye - allowing the
hero to use the power, albeit sparingly, even

00:08:13.361 --> 00:08:15.100
when disguised as Clark Kent.

00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:19.530
As indicated, Superman can also over-charge
with solar power, and in modern versions of

00:08:19.530 --> 00:08:24.810
the character, a new evolution of heat vision
was introduced: the "super flare."

00:08:24.810 --> 00:08:29.360
Using the same mechanics as heat vision, Superman
can unleash a devastating attack on his surrounding

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:33.860
environment - by venting the stored solar
energy in every single one of his cells.

00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:38.160
The super flare is possibly the hero's most
powerful ability but comes with a downside

00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:43.510
- expelling all of his stored up solar energy
leaves Kal-El vulnerable and without powers,

00:08:43.510 --> 00:08:54.020
essentially human, for nearly 24 hours (the
time it takes him to recharge his solar stores).

00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:57.440
Even though we didn’t cover all of Superman’s
powers here, it’s safe to say that many

00:08:57.440 --> 00:09:01.480
of the hero’s stranger abilities can also
be explained by solar-power absorption.

00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:02.480
X-Ray vision?

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:07.070
A further manipulation of Superman’s bio-electric
aura that allows him to perceive cosmic radiation

00:09:07.070 --> 00:09:09.490
bouncing off objects in his surrounding environment.

00:09:09.490 --> 00:09:10.690
Genius level intellect?

00:09:10.690 --> 00:09:14.650
Yellow sun has further enhanced the Man of
Steel's extra-terrestrial biology to process

00:09:14.650 --> 00:09:19.300
information faster than his Kryptonian ancestors
(and much faster than humans).

00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:23.780
No doubt, comic book writers have presented
other explanations for Superman’s abilities;

00:09:23.780 --> 00:09:26.060
yet few offer such a convincing package.

00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:31.090
Now, if only there was a definitive answer
for how the Man of Steel can shave his beard?

00:09:31.090 --> 00:09:33.990
