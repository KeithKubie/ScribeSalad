00:27:14.809 --> 00:27:22.530
 
much more highly

00:27:22.530 --> 00:27:22.540
 
 

00:27:22.540 --> 00:27:25.210
 
so given the kind of micro history that

00:27:25.210 --> 00:27:25.220
so given the kind of micro history that
 

00:27:25.220 --> 00:27:35.880
so given the kind of micro history that
you - I'm wondering how you see

00:27:35.880 --> 00:27:35.890
 
 

00:27:35.890 --> 00:27:38.659
 
and so I

00:27:38.659 --> 00:27:38.669
and so I
 

00:27:38.669 --> 00:27:41.419
and so I
come to this with actually first-hand

00:27:41.419 --> 00:27:41.429
come to this with actually first-hand
 

00:27:41.429 --> 00:27:53.220
come to this with actually first-hand
experience of a

00:27:53.220 --> 00:27:53.230
 
 

00:27:53.230 --> 00:28:02.490
 
we did exchange some information and so

00:28:02.490 --> 00:28:02.500
we did exchange some information and so
 

00:28:02.500 --> 00:28:07.460
we did exchange some information and so
the research I

00:28:07.460 --> 00:28:07.470
 
 

00:28:07.470 --> 00:28:11.340
 
we

00:28:11.340 --> 00:28:11.350
 
 

00:28:11.350 --> 00:28:12.840
 
ownership history of the house in

00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:12.850
ownership history of the house in
 

00:28:12.850 --> 00:28:16.690
ownership history of the house in
southwestern France and

00:28:16.690 --> 00:28:16.700
 
 

00:28:16.700 --> 00:28:21.669
 
and I run across

00:28:21.669 --> 00:28:21.679
 
 

00:28:21.679 --> 00:28:25.549
 
that's in global sellers of that house

00:28:25.549 --> 00:28:25.559
that's in global sellers of that house
 

00:28:25.559 --> 00:28:28.669
that's in global sellers of that house
for owners of the house but where

00:28:28.669 --> 00:28:28.679
for owners of the house but where
 

00:28:28.679 --> 00:28:30.380
for owners of the house but where
residents some of them were business

00:28:30.380 --> 00:28:30.390
residents some of them were business
 

00:28:30.390 --> 00:28:33.070
residents some of them were business
okay

00:28:33.070 --> 00:28:33.080
 
 

00:28:33.080 --> 00:28:36.370
 
and I wanted

00:28:36.370 --> 00:28:36.380
and I wanted
 

00:28:36.380 --> 00:28:40.060
and I wanted
who the heck is and so it's sort of the

00:28:40.060 --> 00:28:40.070
who the heck is and so it's sort of the
 

00:28:40.070 --> 00:28:44.160
who the heck is and so it's sort of the
same people subscribe

00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:44.170
 
 

00:28:44.170 --> 00:28:58.840
 
research work and it took me

00:28:58.840 --> 00:28:58.850
 
 

00:28:58.850 --> 00:29:02.330
 
and butt

00:29:02.330 --> 00:29:02.340
and butt
 

00:29:02.340 --> 00:29:05.389
and butt
something I noticed is that there's a

00:29:05.389 --> 00:29:05.399
something I noticed is that there's a
 

00:29:05.399 --> 00:29:07.459
something I noticed is that there's a
nice to the book that is a history of

00:29:07.459 --> 00:29:07.469
nice to the book that is a history of
 

00:29:07.469 --> 00:29:10.519
nice to the book that is a history of
the research itself so the research

00:29:10.519 --> 00:29:10.529
the research itself so the research
 

00:29:10.529 --> 00:29:14.299
the research itself so the research
itself has a history and sort of an

00:29:14.299 --> 00:29:14.309
itself has a history and sort of an
 

00:29:14.309 --> 00:29:24.080
itself has a history and sort of an
interesting one and and was what your

00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:24.090
interesting one and and was what your
 

00:29:24.090 --> 00:29:27.580
interesting one and and was what your
mom called me and made me an honest one

00:29:27.580 --> 00:29:27.590
mom called me and made me an honest one
 

00:29:27.590 --> 00:29:30.649
mom called me and made me an honest one
but this type of research probably would

00:29:30.649 --> 00:29:30.659
but this type of research probably would
 

00:29:30.659 --> 00:29:39.419
but this type of research probably would
not have been possible what you need

00:29:39.419 --> 00:29:39.429
not have been possible what you need

this is amazing

00:32:56.510 --> 00:32:56.520
this is amazing
 

00:32:56.520 --> 00:32:59.000
this is amazing
and of course the Balkans in us these

00:32:59.000 --> 00:32:59.010
and of course the Balkans in us these

were China chain migration networks and

00:33:02.410 --> 00:33:02.420
were China chain migration networks and
 

00:33:02.420 --> 00:33:05.210
were China chain migration networks and
and they they came from the same places

00:33:05.210 --> 00:33:05.220
and they they came from the same places
 

00:33:05.220 --> 00:33:09.720
and they they came from the same places
and they went the same basis

00:33:17.970 --> 00:33:17.980
across the so I have
 

00:33:17.980 --> 00:33:22.260
across the so I have
a couple of questions and these are open

00:33:22.260 --> 00:33:22.270
a couple of questions and these are open
 

00:33:22.270 --> 00:33:28.830
a couple of questions and these are open
open-ended question I wonder what it

00:33:28.830 --> 00:33:28.840
open-ended question I wonder what it
 

00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:33.460
open-ended question I wonder what it
needs to do

00:33:33.460 --> 00:33:33.470
 
 

00:33:33.470 --> 00:33:39.610
 
like like this what is what is

00:33:39.610 --> 00:33:39.620
like like this what is what is
 

00:33:39.620 --> 00:33:41.320

generations and if you think about the

00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:46.410
generations and if you think about the
 

00:33:46.410 --> 00:33:48.640
generations and if you think about the
different analogues I can think of some

00:33:48.640 --> 00:33:48.650
different analogues I can think of some
 

00:33:48.650 --> 00:33:52.520
different analogues I can think of some
money's contain that tells news stories

00:33:52.520 --> 00:33:52.530
money's contain that tells news stories
 

00:33:52.530 --> 00:33:56.750
money's contain that tells news stories
across several generations

00:33:56.750 --> 00:33:56.760
 
 

00:33:56.760 --> 00:34:03.299
 
and so it sort of - oh that is a lot of

00:34:03.299 --> 00:34:03.309
and so it sort of - oh that is a lot of
 

00:34:03.309 --> 00:34:08.220
and so it sort of - oh that is a lot of
this this story and the other question

00:34:08.220 --> 00:34:08.230
this this story and the other question
 

00:34:08.230 --> 00:34:11.090
this this story and the other question
which is actually related

00:34:11.090 --> 00:34:11.100
which is actually related
 

00:34:11.100 --> 00:34:15.140
which is actually related
first so this is in many ways of the

00:34:15.140 --> 00:34:15.150
first so this is in many ways of the
 

00:34:15.150 --> 00:34:18.770
first so this is in many ways of the
work of historical anthropology but also

00:34:18.770 --> 00:34:18.780
work of historical anthropology but also
 

00:34:18.780 --> 00:34:21.380
work of historical anthropology but also
in some ways the works of the work of a

00:34:21.380 --> 00:34:21.390
in some ways the works of the work of a
 

00:34:21.390 --> 00:34:25.490
in some ways the works of the work of a
quality report because meter cube the

00:34:25.490 --> 00:34:25.500
quality report because meter cube the
 

00:34:25.500 --> 00:34:32.440
quality report because meter cube the
descendants so there is more information

00:34:32.440 --> 00:34:32.450
descendants so there is more information
 

00:34:32.450 --> 00:34:37.160
descendants so there is more information
and and I have to experience I played

00:34:37.160 --> 00:34:37.170
and and I have to experience I played
 

00:34:37.170 --> 00:34:39.350
and and I have to experience I played
the sentence

00:34:39.350 --> 00:34:39.360
the sentence
 

00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:46.880
the sentence
I was at work and it was Andy she tried

00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:46.890
I was at work and it was Andy she tried
 

00:34:46.890 --> 00:34:49.430
I was at work and it was Andy she tried
an experiment which was to ask them what

00:34:49.430 --> 00:34:49.440
an experiment which was to ask them what
 

00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:56.010
an experiment which was to ask them what
they knew without without saying

00:34:56.010 --> 00:34:56.020
 
 

00:34:56.020 --> 00:34:58.980
 
to contaminate the experiment and it was

00:34:58.980 --> 00:34:58.990
to contaminate the experiment and it was
 

00:34:58.990 --> 00:35:01.620
to contaminate the experiment and it was
really interesting to see

00:35:01.620 --> 00:35:01.630
really interesting to see
 

00:35:01.630 --> 00:35:04.590
really interesting to see
very fragmentary information that goes

00:35:04.590 --> 00:35:04.600
very fragmentary information that goes
 

00:35:04.600 --> 00:35:07.140
very fragmentary information that goes
through the generations so so some

00:35:07.140 --> 00:35:07.150
through the generations so so some
 

00:35:07.150 --> 00:35:09.630
through the generations so so some
accurate some not some some distorted

00:35:09.630 --> 00:35:09.640
accurate some not some some distorted
 

00:35:09.640 --> 00:35:12.510
accurate some not some some distorted
and and of course I had to write it down

00:35:12.510 --> 00:35:12.520
and and of course I had to write it down
 

00:35:12.520 --> 00:35:14.400
and and of course I had to write it down
because the moment I thought and then of

00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:14.410
because the moment I thought and then of
 

00:35:14.410 --> 00:35:19.350
because the moment I thought and then of
course the memories and so so I wonder

00:35:19.350 --> 00:35:19.360
course the memories and so so I wonder
