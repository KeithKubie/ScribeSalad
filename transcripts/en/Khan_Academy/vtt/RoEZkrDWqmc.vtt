00:00:00.224 --> 00:00:02.406
- [Voiceover] Blue food
coloring can be oxidized

00:00:02.406 --> 00:00:06.450
by household bleach, which
contains hypochlorite ion,

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.882
or OCI-, to form colorless products,

00:00:09.882 --> 00:00:12.242
as represented by the equation above.

00:00:12.242 --> 00:00:16.649
So we have this equation where
we have blue food coloring,

00:00:16.649 --> 00:00:18.693
which has this chemical formula,

00:00:18.693 --> 00:00:23.569
and it's reacting with
bleach, or hypochlorite,

00:00:23.569 --> 00:00:25.694
and it's making colorless products.

00:00:25.694 --> 00:00:28.579
So we're getting this color
change from blue to colorless.

00:00:29.572 --> 00:00:32.625
A student used a spectrophotometer

00:00:32.625 --> 00:00:36.189
set at a wavelength of 625 nanometers

00:00:36.189 --> 00:00:38.546
to study the absorbance
of the food coloring

00:00:38.546 --> 00:00:41.363
over time during the bleaching process.

00:00:42.366 --> 00:00:45.791
In the study, bleach is
present in large excess,

00:00:45.791 --> 00:00:49.494
and I will underline that
'cause that's important.

00:00:49.494 --> 00:00:52.548
It's present in large excess
so that the concentration

00:00:52.548 --> 00:00:54.951
of hypochlorite is essentially constant

00:00:54.951 --> 00:00:57.255
throughout the reaction.

00:00:57.255 --> 00:00:58.962
The student used data from the study

00:00:58.962 --> 00:01:01.365
to generate the graphs below.

00:01:01.365 --> 00:01:04.919
So we'd like to answer, in part a,

00:01:04.919 --> 00:01:07.762
based on the graphs
above, what is the order

00:01:07.762 --> 00:01:11.617
of the reaction with respect
to the blue food coloring?

00:01:11.617 --> 00:01:13.416
So we have a lot of information here.

00:01:13.416 --> 00:01:15.278
We have these three graphs.

00:01:17.087 --> 00:01:20.001
If we write absorbance as A, we're looking

00:01:20.001 --> 00:01:23.043
at the concentration of A over time.

00:01:23.043 --> 00:01:26.867
We're looking at the ln of A over time,

00:01:27.779 --> 00:01:30.879
the natural log, and we are also, lastly,

00:01:30.879 --> 00:01:34.414
looking at one over the
concentration A over time.

00:01:36.811 --> 00:01:39.834
So, we would like to
know, what is the order

00:01:39.834 --> 00:01:42.581
of the reaction with respect to our blue?

00:01:43.989 --> 00:01:46.254
My first instinct when I see this problem,

00:01:46.254 --> 00:01:51.064
is actually to be a little bit panicky

00:01:51.064 --> 00:01:53.781
because, hey we have a
lot of information here,

00:01:53.781 --> 00:01:55.522
so how do we deal with it?

00:01:55.522 --> 00:01:57.891
We also have a little bit more information

00:01:57.891 --> 00:01:58.866
for this problem.

00:01:58.866 --> 00:02:02.186
We also have the equation sheet.

00:02:02.186 --> 00:02:03.870
So this is the part of the equation sheet

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:05.789
that's relevant for this problem.

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:09.316
So it's all of the equations
that have to do with kinetics,

00:02:09.316 --> 00:02:12.045
which is looking at reaction rates,

00:02:12.045 --> 00:02:14.621
so that is what we're looking at here.

00:02:14.621 --> 00:02:16.316
So we have three possible things

00:02:16.316 --> 00:02:17.999
that might be helpful for this problem.

00:02:17.999 --> 00:02:18.999
Maybe not, right?

00:02:18.999 --> 00:02:21.878
So we have this first
equation which gives us

00:02:21.878 --> 00:02:25.402
the first order integrated rate law.

00:02:26.336 --> 00:02:28.721
We have the second
equation, which gives us

00:02:28.721 --> 00:02:31.298
the second order integrated rate law,

00:02:31.298 --> 00:02:33.178
and we have this third equation

00:02:33.178 --> 00:02:35.708
which is actually an
equation for the half-life.

00:02:35.708 --> 00:02:38.270
So it's saying half-life is .693

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:41.665
divided by k, and that is the half-life

00:02:43.969 --> 00:02:48.283
for a first order reaction.

00:02:51.353 --> 00:02:53.513
And the important thing to remember here,

00:02:53.513 --> 00:02:55.451
which will come up again in a second,

00:02:55.451 --> 00:02:58.295
is that this is a constant,
because k is a constant,

00:02:58.295 --> 00:03:00.119
so our half-life is also a constant

00:03:00.119 --> 00:03:01.948
for a first order reaction.

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:05.970
So that's the information we have.

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.292
Let's look back at our graphs.

00:03:08.292 --> 00:03:10.591
We're gonna start by looking
at just the first graph.

00:03:10.591 --> 00:03:12.716
It turns out we can get
a lot of information

00:03:12.716 --> 00:03:16.227
just by looking at the
concentration of A over time.

00:03:17.278 --> 00:03:18.591
So if we look at this first graph,

00:03:18.591 --> 00:03:19.670
and we look at the concentration

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:21.689
of our blue stuff going down over time,

00:03:21.689 --> 00:03:25.184
we can see immediately
that this is not linear.

00:03:25.184 --> 00:03:26.753
So the fact that it's not linear

00:03:26.753 --> 00:03:29.991
immediately tells us it's not zero order.

00:03:29.991 --> 00:03:32.720
If it was zero order, we would expect

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.986
to see a straight line,
which I will draw in pink,

00:03:36.986 --> 00:03:38.288
with a dotted line because that's not

00:03:38.288 --> 00:03:39.964
actually what we're seeing.

00:03:39.964 --> 00:03:41.869
So it's not zero order.

00:03:43.035 --> 00:03:44.904
We can also get some more information

00:03:44.904 --> 00:03:46.041
by looking at this one graph.

00:03:46.041 --> 00:03:47.202
We know it's not zero order.

00:03:47.202 --> 00:03:50.245
Can we tell from this first
graph if it's first order?

00:03:50.245 --> 00:03:53.240
And the answer is, we actually can.

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:55.963
If you remember from looking
at the equations sheet,

00:03:55.963 --> 00:03:58.878
we said that first order reactions,

00:03:59.988 --> 00:04:03.224
so for first order reactions, we know,

00:04:03.224 --> 00:04:04.412
and I'd say this is maybe one of

00:04:04.412 --> 00:04:07.226
the most important things
about first order reactions,

00:04:07.226 --> 00:04:10.924
is that half-life is constant.

00:04:12.694 --> 00:04:15.898
So that means that the time it takes

00:04:15.898 --> 00:04:17.431
for the concentration to go down

00:04:17.431 --> 00:04:21.610
to half of what it was,
is the same no matter what

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:23.131
your initial concentration is, no matter

00:04:23.131 --> 00:04:27.224
what point in your reaction you're at.

00:04:28.495 --> 00:04:30.109
So that's something we
can actually investigate

00:04:30.109 --> 00:04:31.932
just by looking at this first graph.

00:04:31.932 --> 00:04:33.871
We can see how much time it takes

00:04:33.871 --> 00:04:37.156
to get to half the concentration,

00:04:37.156 --> 00:04:39.420
and see if that's something
that changes over time.

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:43.053
So for example, if we
start with .8 right here,

00:04:44.152 --> 00:04:48.308
half of .8 is .4,

00:04:48.308 --> 00:04:50.094
so we can see how much time it takes

00:04:50.094 --> 00:04:53.699
to get from .8 to .4, which is right here,

00:04:54.749 --> 00:04:58.712
and if we go down we can
see it takes 20 seconds

00:05:03.044 --> 00:05:06.733
to have the concentration

00:05:06.733 --> 00:05:10.142
starting at .8 absorbance units.

00:05:11.609 --> 00:05:16.044
We can look at the half-life
now to go from .4 to .2.

00:05:16.044 --> 00:05:20.131
So if we go from .4 to .2,
and I will change colors

00:05:20.131 --> 00:05:22.913
to make this look more obvious.

00:05:22.913 --> 00:05:25.397
We'll do this in orange.

00:05:25.397 --> 00:05:30.081
So going from .4 to .2
takes another 20 seconds.

00:05:31.434 --> 00:05:33.536
And so we can do this again and again.

00:05:33.536 --> 00:05:35.952
We could go from .2 to .1.

00:05:35.952 --> 00:05:38.006
We'll just see the
continuation of a pattern here,

00:05:38.006 --> 00:05:41.443
which is that, we can see that
it always takes 20 seconds

00:05:41.443 --> 00:05:43.413
to halve the concentration.

00:05:44.266 --> 00:05:47.239
And so the fact that half-life is constant

00:05:47.239 --> 00:05:50.687
based on Graph I, immediately tells us

00:05:50.687 --> 00:05:53.415
that our reaction is first order

00:05:53.415 --> 00:05:55.389
because our half-life is constant.

00:05:55.389 --> 00:05:57.863
We don't even have to look
at any of the other graphs.

00:05:57.863 --> 00:06:00.265
There is another way you
could do this problem.

00:06:00.265 --> 00:06:03.597
You might remember, based on
the equations that we have,

00:06:03.597 --> 00:06:06.131
or based on just equations you know

00:06:06.131 --> 00:06:08.244
off the top of your head.

00:06:08.244 --> 00:06:11.391
So one reason we know, and
one reason we could say

00:06:11.391 --> 00:06:14.760
this is first order, is
because t 1/2 is constant.

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:18.453
The other reason why we
know this is first order is,

00:06:18.453 --> 00:06:22.713
when a reaction is first
order in your reactant,

00:06:22.713 --> 00:06:27.651
you know that graphing ln of your reaction

00:06:27.651 --> 00:06:31.971
versus time, gives you a straight line,

00:06:31.971 --> 00:06:34.435
and we can see from Graph II

00:06:36.483 --> 00:06:38.149
that this is the case.

00:06:39.502 --> 00:06:42.114
So we have these two pieces of evidence,

00:06:42.114 --> 00:06:44.621
from Graph I and Graph II, that tell us

00:06:44.621 --> 00:06:49.103
that this particular reaction
is actually first order

00:06:49.103 --> 00:06:51.040
with respect to the blue food coloring.
