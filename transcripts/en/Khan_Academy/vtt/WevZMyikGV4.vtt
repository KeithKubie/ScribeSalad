00:00:00.388 --> 00:00:05.507
- Which number line shows 361 + 544?

00:00:05.507 --> 00:00:09.149
Let's see, in all of them we're starting at 361,

00:00:09.149 --> 00:00:11.660
so now let's add 544.

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:15.804
This one starts with adding 400, and then 50, and then 4,

00:00:15.804 --> 00:00:20.181
it's adding 454, not 544.

00:00:20.181 --> 00:00:25.186
Now this one adds 500, then 40, and then 4,

00:00:25.186 --> 00:00:28.852
so this is adding 544,

00:00:28.852 --> 00:00:33.132
to 361, we see that it is 905.

00:00:33.132 --> 00:00:36.470
This makes sense, you add 500, you get 861,

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.639
you add 40, you get to 901, and then add the 4,

00:00:39.639 --> 00:00:42.586
you get 905, so definitely go with that choice.

00:00:42.586 --> 00:00:45.442
This one over here, instead of add 500, you add 50,

00:00:45.442 --> 00:00:46.545
which doesn't make sense

00:00:46.545 --> 00:00:50.864
because we're clearly adding 5 hundreds, 4 tens, or 40,

00:00:50.864 --> 00:00:54.919
and then 4 ones, let's do some more examples.

00:00:54.919 --> 00:00:56.605
Which expression can be solved

00:00:56.606 --> 00:00:58.340
with the following number line?

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:02.844
Let's see, we're starting at 718, and then we're adding 200,

00:01:02.844 --> 00:01:05.642
and then we're adding 40 to get to 958.

00:01:05.642 --> 00:01:10.420
This is really 718 + 240,

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.950
which is this choice right over there.

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.775
This is kind of, strangely fun.

00:01:16.775 --> 00:01:21.590
Which number line shows 585 - 368?

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:24.344
Let's see, these second two number lines,

00:01:24.344 --> 00:01:28.454
both start at 585, we're starting our computation at 585,

00:01:28.454 --> 00:01:31.378
this one's starting at 558, so it swapped the numbers,

00:01:31.379 --> 00:01:32.482
so this one doesn't make sense,

00:01:32.482 --> 00:01:34.316
but let's look at these two choices.

00:01:34.316 --> 00:01:38.379
We want to subtract 3 hundreds, 6 tens, and 8 ones.

00:01:38.379 --> 00:01:42.600
In both of these, we subtract 3 hundreds,

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.662
and then we want to subtract 6 tens,

00:01:45.662 --> 00:01:48.932
6 tens, and then 8 ones, that's this one over here.

00:01:48.932 --> 00:01:52.612
This one swaps the... instead of having 6 tens and 8 ones,

00:01:52.612 --> 00:01:55.201
it has 8 tens and 6 ones, so it swapped...

00:01:55.201 --> 00:01:58.660
this is subtracting 386, which isn't the original problem,

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:01.155
so definitely like this third choice.

00:02:01.156 --> 00:02:04.590
Let's do one more example.

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:05.637
Which expression has been solved

00:02:05.637 --> 00:02:07.135
with the following number line?

00:02:07.135 --> 00:02:11.116
We're starting at 935, and then we're going to subtract 400,

00:02:11.116 --> 00:02:13.890
and then we're going to subtract 20.

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.817
This is 935 - 420.

00:02:16.817 --> 00:02:21.318
935 - 420,

00:02:21.318 --> 00:02:24.800
that choice right over there.
