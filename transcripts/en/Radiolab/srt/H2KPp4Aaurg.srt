1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:04,000
Hello, I'm Jad Abumrad I'm Robert
Krulwich, This is Radiolab.

2
00:00:04,001 --> 00:00:06,370
We're back from our break.
Yes we do. During our breaks,

3
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:08,740
what would you say we do during
our breaks? We don't do anything.

4
00:00:08,741 --> 00:00:13,120
We don't exist really. And we're going
to continue with our show here. A today,

5
00:00:13,121 --> 00:00:15,100
how many meditations?

6
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:18,670
1111 meditations on things relating
to death and what happens after,

7
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:22,070
but we're not up to
living. This is a five.

8
00:00:22,071 --> 00:00:26,070
It's called four seconds down
from producers who are in wheeler.

9
00:00:26,071 --> 00:00:31,050
Wake up. Everything's pretty black.

10
00:00:31,051 --> 00:00:35,760
Same as Azman. Last couple of
weeks. This is Ken Baldwin.

11
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:40,560
The day he's talking about is August
20th, 1985. Say Goodbye to my wife

12
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:44,100
and I just say, you
know, I'll be home late.

13
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:48,300
Do some overtime at the time he used
to living couple hours east of San

14
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:52,410
Francisco. Say Goodbye.
Say I love her. And uh,

15
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:56,370
I know right now that I
won't survive the day.

16
00:00:57,450 --> 00:01:01,890
She has no idea how I feel. Everything is,

17
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:06,720
is dark, everything is, is black.

18
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:11,130
So I get in my car, I'm, I'm just
not a very good person drive to work.

19
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:15,420
Cause I think maybe, uh,
maybe I can do it one more day

20
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,800
closer. I get to work the
more I realize I've, I've,

21
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:23,460
I've got to disappear to,

22
00:01:23,461 --> 00:01:27,210
to start over and get rid
of whatever it is I've got.

23
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,910
It's got to end. I drive right
past work and then I'm on the, uh,

24
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:37,010
freeway kind of relaxed and I
finally see the bridge and it's,

25
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:41,670
it's huge. It's gigantic. He
parks his car at the bridge,

26
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,130
puts money in the meter and uh,

27
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:49,080
I start walking and I'm walking on the
bridge just like any other tourists.

28
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:52,140
It's a beautiful day.
It's a gorgeous Wednesday.

29
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:55,350
I see everything around
me and it's just gorgeous.

30
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:59,670
And I find a place, it's,
it's an outcropping.

31
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:05,450
You can see straight down
into the water and I say, uh,

32
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:09,390
this is the time to do it.
You really got to do this.

33
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:13,140
I really believed that everybody
would be better off without me

34
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:15,820
[inaudible]

35
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:17,980
that everybody would just
get on with their lives,

36
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,610
feeling better about me being
gone. Then me being here,

37
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:26,170
I put my hands on the, on
the railing count to 10

38
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:35,623
[inaudible]

39
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:37,590
and I vaulted over

40
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,620
and the last things I uh,

41
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:46,670
saw leave the bridge where
my hands and that moment,

42
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:49,670
that very moment

43
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:53,280
I said, oh my God, this is a mistake.

44
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:58,840
[inaudible] nothing I can do about
it. The fall from the bridge to the,

45
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:04,620
it takes about four seconds and it was
almost like a quick flickers of what I

46
00:03:06,221 --> 00:03:10,330
was trying to think of my family,
my daughter, three years old,

47
00:03:10,331 --> 00:03:11,520
I'll never see her grow up.

48
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:14,770
The things she's going to see
that I don't get to see man,

49
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:17,740
the misery that I caused. This is bad.

50
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:20,650
I'm sorry guys that I did this to you.

51
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:23,200
I do want to listen to
how it's going to end

52
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:28,220
and I just blacked out

53
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:39,230
and I woke up and I was swimming for
my life and I was saying, oh my God,

54
00:03:39,231 --> 00:03:41,240
somebody please save me
somebody. Somebody saved,

55
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:46,420
he hit the water and a ball. He
bruised his feet, his backside,

56
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:48,100
but no serious injuries.

57
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:51,760
Some workers saw him jump
and called the coast guard.

58
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:55,100
And then the next thing I remember,
I was on the coast guard cutter.

59
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:01,120
Only 26 people have made it onto that
boat out of a thousand or so that have

60
00:04:01,121 --> 00:04:01,954
jumped.

61
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:07,030
And nearly all of them say that in the
middle of the fall when they're facing

62
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:10,210
their death, something
inside them changed.

63
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:12,660
[inaudible]

64
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:13,670
they didn't want to die.

65
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:15,370
[inaudible]

66
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:16,150
for Ken,

67
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:20,530
that change happened the very moment
he saw his hands leave the bridge.

68
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:22,130
I can see that perfectly.

69
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:23,850
[inaudible]

70
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:28,380
I can, I can, I can see my hands leave
the bridge. I don't know if it was a,

71
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,550
if it was a mechanical
switch or a, you know, um,

72
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:35,940
some kind of switch in the
brain function, but it,

73
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:42,110
for some reason it became
a switch to another life.

74
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,513
[inaudible]

75
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:01,993
number six

76
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:07,700
m a dead. Ooh, I hear some seagulls.

77
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:09,890
You hear the seagulls? Yeah.
Where are they coming from?

78
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:13,130
We just on the edge of the, um, the
English Channel on the Atlantic.

79
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:17,150
So they've got you in a little box
floating in the ocean. We don't actually,

80
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:20,310
we're not that far away from, from the
sea. So we get lots of seagulls here.

81
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:24,100
This is Paul Brock's, he's not really
floating in a box in the ocean. He used,

82
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,540
it's in a box near the ocean. And uh,

83
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:30,530
the reason we've connected our box in New
York to his in England is because of a

84
00:05:30,531 --> 00:05:32,180
question he was once asked, you know,

85
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:35,840
if you work in this sort of line
that I've worked in over the years,

86
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:38,840
you get the most bizarre
statements and questions,

87
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:41,180
which is because Palsy neuropsychologist,

88
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:45,170
which means he diagnosis patients
with various mental disorders.

89
00:05:45,171 --> 00:05:50,171
And he describes this one case about
eight years ago involving a woman named

90
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:55,850
Jeannie, just an ordinary pleasant middle
aged woman from the north of England,

91
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:58,940
early fifties well loved by her
family. She comes into his office,

92
00:05:58,941 --> 00:06:00,860
he runs it through some basic tests.

93
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:05,020
I just did a basic assessment of as I
would in that sort of case of genuine

94
00:06:05,021 --> 00:06:07,190
intellectual level. And at
first she seemed pretty with it.

95
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:11,390
She answered all his questions. He seemed
pretty alert. But then, well, she was,

96
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:16,160
she, we then go into a conversation
about whether things seemed real.

97
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:19,400
What does that mean? Well, it's
difficult to pin that one down.

98
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:23,150
She just felt that things weren't real.

99
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:26,960
She would point to objects in the room
and say, well, that cup that doesn't,

100
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:31,130
doesn't seem real, does it? Or
the chair doesn't seem real.

101
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:35,150
It just doesn't feel real. So I can
see it and I can describe it to you,

102
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:37,940
but it just doesn't feel real.

103
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:41,150
And the thing that really made me sit up

104
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:46,780
was when she said, um, I
forget the exact phrase,

105
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:49,480
but it's in the book. Um,
eventually Jeannie said,

106
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:54,700
am I dad and like to add? Yes. Do you
think I'm dead? Do you think I'd die?

107
00:06:54,701 --> 00:06:58,210
I didn't respond immediately.
I let the silence flow.

108
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:04,570
Jeannie smiled. The face was
lit with a benign perplexity.

109
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:07,870
There was a smear of toothpaste
around the corner from that.

110
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:12,910
She didn't seem to notice the droplets
of tea spinning onto her dressing gun,

111
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:16,690
but there was a Glinton right in the
middle of the night. I was convinced.

112
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:20,150
She said, I thought they'd
come to take me away.

113
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:21,780
[inaudible]

114
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:24,390
I can't say for sure that
I'm dead. She continued.

115
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:29,230
The things are not the
same. I don't feel real.

116
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:34,930
It seems to me like he did.
How would I know if I was dead?

117
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:42,220
[inaudible]

118
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:46,430
immediately made me think. This might
be an example of coats syndrome.

119
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:50,290
No one really knows what causes Kotara
[inaudible] Syndrome. Very rare.

120
00:07:50,291 --> 00:07:54,730
I mean I've come across three
cases, but one of the symptoms,

121
00:07:55,060 --> 00:08:00,060
he says often this sense of deep sense
that you're somehow not completely here.

122
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:03,900
One idea about, um,

123
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:09,090
this syndrome is that somehow there's
a decoupling of thoughts and feelings,

124
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:14,020
which means what exactly
here's how to explain it to me.

125
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:17,650
The brain has two jobs.
It's doing it all times.

126
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:21,370
The first is to keep track of
what's happening outside your body.

127
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:24,730
Like the sites that are
coming out. You smell, touch,

128
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:28,480
your central experience of the world and
the most immediate consciousness of the

129
00:08:28,481 --> 00:08:31,510
body and the world and the body
being in the world. All the while.

130
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:36,511
The brain also is maintaining this inner
life where you think thoughts and you

131
00:08:36,521 --> 00:08:38,650
have memories, personality,

132
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:41,830
what you normally think of when you
think about yourself, you right,

133
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:45,890
what do you think happens in these,
in this condition? Is it that outer?

134
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:49,180
Are you, this was sensual
self somehow gets cut,

135
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:54,970
cut off from that inner mental
you and it just drifts off to

136
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,920
leaving you with just thoughts,

137
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:02,320
but it's the feelings that give us
our in the moment sense of self.

138
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:07,080
So if you don't have feelings
attached to forts and perception,

139
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:08,440
then you're like a vapor.

140
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:12,190
You're there but you have no weight
isn't what you're describing.

141
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:15,910
Basically one version of the
afterlife, like my body's gone,

142
00:09:15,911 --> 00:09:17,770
but some thing remains.

143
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:19,150
Yeah, I hadn't thought
of that. That's very,

144
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:21,190
very interesting way to think about it.

145
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:26,880
But is that any different than the
story persisting in someone else's head?

146
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:45,943
[inaudible] seven

147
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:50,030
do you guys know this group? That edge
edge.org it's John Brock News Group.

148
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:52,810
Yeah, we do. That's David Eagleman
again and for number seven,

149
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:57,350
a brief excerpt from a conversation we
had with him. If I only had a brain, so,

150
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:59,680
so I just wrote an essay
on there yesterday.

151
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:02,700
It came out because this big ideas
that will change the world [inaudible]

152
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:06,340
exactly. Yeah. What's the thing that'll
change everything? And my answer was,

153
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:09,070
and I think this is something
I'll actually see in my lifetime.

154
00:10:09,071 --> 00:10:12,340
So the idea is silicone and
mortality. In other words,

155
00:10:12,341 --> 00:10:17,341
downloading your consciousness and do a
computer and we'll really have reached a

156
00:10:17,561 --> 00:10:21,670
new point where there'll be a
mortality. Ah, how would you,

157
00:10:21,671 --> 00:10:23,240
how would you figure this
would work? We did so.

158
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:27,340
So imagine you make an exact copy of
the three dimensional structure of the

159
00:10:27,341 --> 00:10:29,980
brain. All the neurons, all the
connections between the neurons,

160
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:33,340
the proteins inside the
phosphorylation states of the proteins.

161
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,050
You make a copy of this whole thing.

162
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:39,940
What matters is the algorithms that
are running on top of the brain,

163
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:42,070
it's not the wet gushy stuff that matters.

164
00:10:42,071 --> 00:10:44,440
It's what that wet gushy
stuff is implementing.

165
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:48,130
And the idea is that if you could recreate
the brain out of let's say beer cans

166
00:10:48,131 --> 00:10:52,750
and tennis balls and you get all the
structure the same and it runs the same

167
00:10:52,751 --> 00:10:55,330
algorithms, then that would be,
you would have your consciousness,

168
00:10:55,331 --> 00:10:57,600
your memories, your
thoughts and so on. Yeah.

169
00:10:57,610 --> 00:11:00,670
Right now it's science fiction
because it's so much data.

170
00:11:00,671 --> 00:11:04,050
Our current computers can handle it.
Is that the only limitation? Just the,

171
00:11:04,051 --> 00:11:07,910
the hard drive size? No. There's
other limitation where there are two,

172
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:09,670
there are two limitations right now.

173
00:11:09,671 --> 00:11:14,230
One is our imaging technology and the
other is the amount of storage capacity

174
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:15,430
and error. I mean,

175
00:11:15,431 --> 00:11:19,090
you get one Adam or two wrong and all
of a sudden instead of your cat named

176
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:22,690
cocoa, it's now named Boko and then
you're not the same person. No,

177
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,050
that's not true. In fact, because every
time you hit your head on a cabinet,

178
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:29,710
you're actually killing lots of neurons,
but that doesn't change who you are.

179
00:11:29,711 --> 00:11:32,230
You don't miss remember
your cat's name. I mean,

180
00:11:32,231 --> 00:11:35,470
imagine that you changed one
word in, in the novel, Moby Dick.

181
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:39,160
It would still be Moby Dick.
It'd be more almost Moby Dick.

182
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:41,470
It would be almost Moby Dick. But,

183
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:46,540
but you are almost the same person day
to day and you're never exactly the same

184
00:11:46,541 --> 00:11:49,330
person that you were yesterday because
of the small changes in your brain.

185
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:53,920
But let's imagine that you're right,
despite Robert's objection not imagining,

186
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:56,430
let's just say you stick
to the Hubris of this.

187
00:11:57,010 --> 00:12:01,210
What would you actually do with
a xerox brains to be immortal?

188
00:12:01,211 --> 00:12:03,610
Don't you have new car? No, no, no, no.
But I mean you seen his own life. No,

189
00:12:03,611 --> 00:12:07,360
no. But what, which, how would
you interface with a xerox brain?

190
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:12,600
So the idea is if we can recreate a
brain in zeros and ones on a computer,

191
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:15,790
then you could actually live
inside of a virtual world

192
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:22,870
and you could enjoy living
in this world indefinitely.

193
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:26,230
Or like the scarecrow

194
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:30,300
[inaudible].

195
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:34,590
If I only had a brain, he,

196
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:39,090
he didn't have a real brain.
He had straw and a certificate.

197
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,920
Well, you don't actually know that you
have a real brain either, right? One,

198
00:12:42,921 --> 00:12:45,690
there are, there are modern philosophers
who deal with this in a very,

199
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:50,700
in a real way. They ask, how would
we know if we are a simulation?

200
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:54,780
Why would we die if we were a
simulation? He's not going die. Ah,

201
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:57,960
well, so this, this is
the point of my book.

202
00:12:57,961 --> 00:13:02,220
Some is to illustrate that there
are lots of possibilities out there.

203
00:13:02,221 --> 00:13:04,440
Right here it comes with you,

204
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:11,170
interrupt you because you're about
to become immortal. So there,

205
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:13,680
there are many different stories
written here and some of them,

206
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:19,140
God is actually a married couple that
got separated and then reunited or that

207
00:13:19,141 --> 00:13:21,480
God is the size of a microbe

208
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:27,720
eight. Did we say eight or is it nine?
I think it was nine, I think were eight.

209
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:31,370
Um, ineffable. Another story by
David Eagleman and his books,

210
00:13:31,371 --> 00:13:34,260
some read for us again
by actor Jeffrey tambor

211
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,750
when soldiers part ways at war's end,

212
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:42,480
the breakup of the platoon triggers
the same emotion as the well,

213
00:13:42,481 --> 00:13:47,040
the death of a person. It's the
final bloodless death of the war.

214
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:51,570
The same mood Hans actors on the drop
of the final curtain after months of

215
00:13:51,571 --> 00:13:52,261
working together,

216
00:13:52,261 --> 00:13:57,261
something something greater
than themselves has just
died after a store closes

217
00:13:58,530 --> 00:14:02,760
its doors on its final evening or
a congress wraps its final session.

218
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:07,170
The participants amble away feeling that
they were just part of something larger

219
00:14:07,171 --> 00:14:11,280
than themselves, something they
intuit had a life, even though they,

220
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:15,810
they can't quite put a
finger on it in this way,

221
00:14:15,811 --> 00:14:20,811
death is not only for humans but for
everything that existed and it turns out

222
00:14:20,911 --> 00:14:23,940
that anything that enjoys
life enjoys an afterlife,

223
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:27,990
platoons and plays and stores
and congresses, they don't end.

224
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:31,260
They just move on to
a different dimension.

225
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:35,730
Although it's difficult for us to
imagine how these beings interact.

226
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:41,310
They enjoy a well this
delicious afterlife together.

227
00:14:41,311 --> 00:14:43,890
They exchange stories of their adventures.

228
00:14:43,891 --> 00:14:48,060
They laugh about good times and often,
well just like us, just like humans,

229
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:53,090
they lament how short this thing is brief.

230
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:55,413
It is.

231
00:14:56,950 --> 00:15:00,850
It may seem mysterious to you that these
organizations can live on without the

232
00:15:00,851 --> 00:15:04,090
people who compose them, but the
underlying principle, it's simple.

233
00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:08,890
After life is made of
spirits. I mean, after all,

234
00:15:08,891 --> 00:15:12,100
you don't bring your kidney or your
liver or your heart to the afterlife with

235
00:15:12,101 --> 00:15:15,970
you. Instead, you gained independence
from the pieces that make you up.

236
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:18,583
Now,

237
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:23,860
a consequence of this cosmic scheme
is going to surprise you when you die.

238
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:29,450
You're aggrieved by all the
atoms of which you were composed.

239
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:32,840
Yeah. I mean, they hung
together for years,

240
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:36,860
whether in sheets of skin or communities
as spleen, but with your death,

241
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:39,890
they don't die. Instead, they,

242
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,980
they part ways moving off in
their separate directions,

243
00:15:42,981 --> 00:15:44,840
mourning the loss of a special time.

244
00:15:44,841 --> 00:15:49,610
They share together actually haunted by
the feeling that they were once playing

245
00:15:49,611 --> 00:15:53,750
parts in something larger than themselves,

246
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:57,770
something that had its
own life, something, um,

247
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:03,500
well, they can hardly put a finger on.
