00:00:00.014 --> 00:00:01.905
- [Voiceover] In the sequence above

00:00:01.905 --> 00:00:04.215
the first term is one and each term

00:00:04.215 --> 00:00:06.642
after the first is twice
the proceeding term.

00:00:06.642 --> 00:00:09.230
What is the sum of the 16th, 17th,

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:11.864
and 18th terms in the sequence?

00:00:12.214 --> 00:00:13.595
So let's write the sequence down again.

00:00:13.595 --> 00:00:18.595
It's one, two, four, eight, 16,

00:00:19.284 --> 00:00:20.944
and just keeps going on and on.

00:00:20.944 --> 00:00:24.845
So the first term here,
this is the first term.

00:00:24.845 --> 00:00:25.851
What is this?

00:00:25.851 --> 00:00:27.302
Well one way to think about it is

00:00:27.302 --> 00:00:29.334
that this is two to the zero power

00:00:29.334 --> 00:00:31.981
and our second term right over here,

00:00:31.981 --> 00:00:33.417
this is two to the first power.

00:00:33.417 --> 00:00:35.437
And then our third term right over here,

00:00:35.437 --> 00:00:37.527
this is two to the second power.

00:00:37.527 --> 00:00:39.396
Our fourth term here, you see the pattern,

00:00:39.396 --> 00:00:41.067
this is two to the third power.

00:00:41.067 --> 00:00:42.774
Our fifth term in the sequence,

00:00:42.774 --> 00:00:44.701
this is two to the fourth power.

00:00:44.701 --> 00:00:46.007
So if we were to go to the 16th,

00:00:46.007 --> 00:00:48.662
17th, and 18th terms, so let's go there.

00:00:48.662 --> 00:00:50.617
So if we were to go to,

00:00:50.617 --> 00:00:54.367
if we were to go to the, so dot, dot, dot,

00:00:54.367 --> 00:00:57.002
if we were to go to the 16th, 17th

00:00:57.002 --> 00:01:00.531
and 18th term, the 16th term is going

00:01:00.531 --> 00:01:02.272
to be, if we just follow this pattern

00:01:02.272 --> 00:01:03.282
right over here, it's going to be

00:01:03.282 --> 00:01:06.707
two to the one minus less
than the term power, right?

00:01:06.707 --> 00:01:08.507
When it's the fifth term,
it's the fourth power,

00:01:08.507 --> 00:01:10.341
when it's the fourth term,
it's the third power.

00:01:10.341 --> 00:01:12.314
So this is going to two to the 15th power.

00:01:12.314 --> 00:01:14.903
This is going to be two to the 16th power

00:01:14.903 --> 00:01:18.885
and this is going to be
two to the 17th power.

00:01:18.885 --> 00:01:21.102
And so what's the sum of the 16th,

00:01:21.102 --> 00:01:24.875
17th and 18th terms in the sequence?

00:01:24.875 --> 00:01:26.681
Well it's going to be,

00:01:27.217 --> 00:01:30.282
it's going to be two to the 15th,

00:01:30.282 --> 00:01:35.282
plus two to the 16th,
plus two to the 17th.

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.197
Now this is accurate,
but if you were taking

00:01:39.197 --> 00:01:40.962
this on a test and this wasn't the form

00:01:40.962 --> 00:01:42.924
that they have it in, we could try

00:01:42.924 --> 00:01:44.027
to manipulate this a little bit

00:01:44.027 --> 00:01:45.640
and the one way to manipulate it would be

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.274
well let's try to factor
out a two to the 15th power.

00:01:49.274 --> 00:01:51.758
So if you factor out a
two to the 15th power,

00:01:51.758 --> 00:01:55.601
so this is going to two to the 15th times,

00:01:55.601 --> 00:01:58.689
so two to the 15th divided
by two to the 15th,

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:00.359
that's just going to be one.

00:02:00.837 --> 00:02:03.449
Two to the 16th divided
by two to the 15th,

00:02:03.449 --> 00:02:05.477
well that's just going to be two, right?

00:02:05.477 --> 00:02:06.649
Let me write that down.

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:09.064
Two to the 16th over two to the 15th,

00:02:09.064 --> 00:02:12.988
that's equivalent to two
to the 16 minus 15th power,

00:02:12.988 --> 00:02:14.738
which is just equal to two to the first,

00:02:14.738 --> 00:02:16.642
which is just equal to two.

00:02:16.642 --> 00:02:18.627
So that's going to be one plus two,

00:02:18.627 --> 00:02:21.517
and then finally two to the 17th,

00:02:21.517 --> 00:02:25.546
two to the 17th divided by two to the 15th

00:02:25.546 --> 00:02:28.018
is equal to two to the second power,

00:02:28.018 --> 00:02:29.572
or just four.

00:02:30.178 --> 00:02:32.058
So just four right over there,

00:02:32.058 --> 00:02:34.403
and there's, this obviously will simplify

00:02:34.403 --> 00:02:37.118
to one plus two plus four is just seven,

00:02:37.758 --> 00:02:38.975
is just seven.

00:02:39.302 --> 00:02:40.870
So the answer to their question?

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.304
It would be seven times two to the 15th.

00:02:43.304 --> 00:02:48.294
So it'd be seven times
two to the 15th power.
