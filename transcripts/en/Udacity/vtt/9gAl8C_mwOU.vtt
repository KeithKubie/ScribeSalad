00:00:00.462 --> 00:00:02.550
&gt;&gt; All right, so that quiz maybe was ill-placed, in

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:04.630
that it was about what this is not about. What

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:09.150
this is about is computational learning theory. And computational learning

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.750
theory really gets us a formal way of addressing three really

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.860
important questions. One is, what's a learning problem? Let's, let's

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:18.820
define very carefully what it is that we want a

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:21.960
learning algorithm to do. If we can do that, we

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.510
can actually show that specific algorithms either work or don't work,

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:27.980
with regard to the definition of the problem. And maybe we

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.950
can even come up with algorithms that solve those problems better.

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:35.300
So that's kind of on the upper-bound side. And then on

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.400
the lower-bound side we can also show, for example, in some cases

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.730
that some problems are just fundamentally hard. So you, you define

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.061
a particular learning problem and you discover. Wait, the algorithms that I'm

00:00:45.061 --> 00:00:47.180
thinking of don't seem to work. You might actually be able

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.060
to show that no algorithms, say, no algorithms in some particular class

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:52.720
are ever going to be able to solve them

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.150
because, that problem is not solvable by problems in that

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:58.230
class. So those problems are fundamentally hard. So, answering

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.100
these kinds of questions require that you be fairly careful

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.830
about defining things and using mathematical reasoning to, to

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:07.860
determine what's going on. So we're going to focus mostly

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:13.440
on that, talk about some algorithms that are not necessarily

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.110
practical. You wouldn't necessarily want to use them, but they do

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.780
help illuminate what the fundamental learning questions are

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.802
and, and why certain algorithms are effective and ineffective.

00:01:21.802 --> 00:01:24.050
&gt;&gt; Okay, so Michael, so can I ask you a question then?

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.470
&gt;&gt; Sure, please.

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:28.110
&gt;&gt; So, it sounds to me like you've just justified this in the

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.970
same way that a computing theoretician might

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:33.420
try to justify theory. Are they related?

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.380
&gt;&gt; Right. That's a very good observation. In fact, the, the kinds of

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.190
analyses and tools that are used for

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:41.140
analyzing learning questions are also the same

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.470
kinds of tools and mechanisms that are used in the context

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:48.500
of a-, analyzing algorithms in computing. So yeah, that's exactly right.

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:49.140
&gt;&gt; Okay, great.

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.170
&gt;&gt; In fact, let's let's, let's leverage that analogy.

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:54.940
And we'll do it in the context of a quiz.
