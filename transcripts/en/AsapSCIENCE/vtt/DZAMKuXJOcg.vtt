00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.319
It's easy to feel that the way we experience life is generally the same for others,

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:09.480
but did you realize that the majority of people in this world that don't actually have the internet?

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:15.140
About 3.5 billion people - or only 40% of the world - has an internet connection today,

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:20.700
meaning, this digital reality we experience is actually done so by a minority of people in the world!

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:24.620
Or how about the fact that the majority of people in the world live in this circle?

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:30.680
In fact it contains 22 of the world's 37 megacities which each have at least 10 million people.

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.220
Only two cities in America fall into this category: New York and Los Angeles.

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:39.040
On that note, the majority of the world actually live in "Developing Countries."

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.580
In fact, modern language is now advocating to change terms like "Third World Country" to

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.100
"Majority World Country" to more accurately represent that these countries are well...

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.600
...the majority of humankind!

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:53.640
Even if the G8 countries make decisions that affect the majority of people on this planet.

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:59.480
To that point around 70%-80% percent of people on this planet make less than $10 US dollars a day!

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:05.640
While even in a wealthy country like America, over 50% percent of people make less than $30,000 dollars a year!

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.930
The good news, is that global poverty has fallen by half over the last decade.

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.660
But we still have a global environment where more people have cellphones than toilets!

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:19.440
And when they're talking on those phone, the vast majority aren't speaking English as a first language.

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.160
The majority also aren't Christian.

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:28.380
As of November 2016, most people are male, with roughly 55 million less females on the planet!

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.160
And of our population, the majority are under the age of 30!

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:37.100
In America, once you turn 37, you're officially older than half the country!

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.940
And the most common age for a person to be worldwide?

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:45.920
0 years old, followed by 1 year old, 2 years old, 3, 4, and then...26 years old?

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:51.000
The majority of adults in the world weigh around 61 kilograms or 135 pounds.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.420
Whereas the vast majority of people in North America are overweight! :(

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.300
And while the majority of North Americans drink coffee over tea,

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:05.200
3 cups of tea are drank for every 1 cup of coffee worldwide, making it a much more popular drink!

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:10.640
Speaking of North America, the majority of the Canadian population actually lives south of Seattle!

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.200
In terms of energy consumption,

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:18.200
the vast majority of the world consume more than 2x times less energy per capita than Canadians or Americans

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.500
If we take a wide view,

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:26.820
it turns out that the majority of the universe is made up of Dark Energy at 68%, Dark matter makes up 27%,

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:27.800
and the rest

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:32.700
- everything on Earth and everything ever observed with instruments, otherwise called "Normal Matter" -

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.240
only makes up 5% of the universe!

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:40.060
And given that atoms are made up of 99.99% empty space,

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.580
the majority of you is...nothing! ;)

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:46.200
We want to send a special thanks to Bill and Melinda gates for supporting this episode

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.520
Did you know the number of childhood deaths have been cut in half over the last 15 years and that?

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:57.029
122 million children's lives have been saved since 1990 sometimes it may feel like the world is getting worse

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:03.209
But global health intervention is changing that and in their annual letter Bill and Melinda gates highlight this amazing progress

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:07.649
But also the challenges like how 45 percent of child deaths are linked to malnutrition

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:13.979
