within the book one basic starting point
 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:18.490
within the book one basic starting point
is when you look at folks who identify

is when you look at folks who identify
 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:21.940
is when you look at folks who identify
as lesbian gay or bisexual the majority

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950
as lesbian gay or bisexual the majority
 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:25.740
as lesbian gay or bisexual the majority
actually 52% of that population are

actually 52% of that population are
 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:30.879
actually 52% of that population are
bisexual and so while it's often an

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:30.889

afterthought and I think unfortunately

00:03:33.909 --> 00:03:33.919
afterthought and I think unfortunately
 

00:03:33.919 --> 00:03:36.339

it's often an afterthought the
 

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:38.530
it's often an afterthought the

transgender folks there's there's
 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:56.589
transgender folks there's there's
certainly a stigma and that's reflected

00:03:56.589 --> 00:03:56.599
certainly a stigma and that's reflected
 

00:03:56.599 --> 00:03:58.000
certainly a stigma and that's reflected
in the numbers too when you look at like

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.010
in the numbers too when you look at like
 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:01.390
in the numbers too when you look at like
health disparities between lesbian and

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:01.400

numbers and statistics that would

00:04:06.699 --> 00:04:06.709
numbers and statistics that would
 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:09.210
numbers and statistics that would
suggest that bisexual people face

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:09.220
suggest that bisexual people face
 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:13.360
suggest that bisexual people face
additional stress and additional health

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:13.370
additional stress and additional health
 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:16.479
additional stress and additional health
risks I think because of the stigma that

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:16.489
risks I think because of the stigma that
 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:20.670
risks I think because of the stigma that
is attached by various facets of society

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:20.680
is attached by various facets of society
 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:24.520
is attached by various facets of society
to being bisexual so I think that's and

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:24.530
to being bisexual so I think that's and
 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:26.230
to being bisexual so I think that's and
when you look at media portrayals -

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:26.240
when you look at media portrayals -
 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:31.930
when you look at media portrayals -
there's been certainly strong progress

there's been certainly strong progress
 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:35.490
there's been certainly strong progress
for gay and lesbian characters and

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:35.500
for gay and lesbian characters and
 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:38.260
for gay and lesbian characters and
medium strong progress for transgender

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:38.270
medium strong progress for transgender
 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:40.680
