00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.520
When Lauren was fifteen years old, her family
moved across the country and she started going

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:09.700
to a new school. Already shy, Lauren suffered
from low self-confidence and had a hard time

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:14.409
transitioning; nothing felt right and soon
her changing body became a source of insecurity.

00:00:14.409 --> 00:00:19.250
Eventually, she began thinking that maybe
if she lost weight and focused on fitness,

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:23.180
she'd make more friends and feel better about
herself and life would get better. Soon she

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:27.590
became obsessed with dieting and it quickly
spiraled into her subsisting only on rice

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:29.960
cakes and apples and candy corn and celery.

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:35.210
She like this new feeling of control every
time she stood on the scale and saw a lower

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:40.730
number. She was achieving something, and that made
her feel good. Soon, she thought of nothing else.

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:44.660
But what Lauren couldn't see was that she
was no longer healthy. Even when her hair

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.850
started falling out and her skin grew dry and cracked,
and when she could never get warm.

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:52.899
When she looked in the mirror, she still saw
a chubby girl.

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:58.059
Her family, though, did notice, and yet, at a visit
to the doctor, she was just told to eat more.

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:58.860
She didn't.

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:04.660
One day while jogging, she had a heart attack
and collapsed. As a teenager, she was 5'7"

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:08.800
and weighed eighty-two pounds. Lauren was
finally admitted to a psychiatric hospital

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:13.430
where she was treated for anorexia nervosa.
She was put on bed rest, saw a therapist twice

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:17.580
a week, joined a support group and slowly
began eating small amounts of food again.

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.190
Her recovery was slow but, with the support
of her family and doctors, she was released

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:25.500
eight months later. Though Lauren suffered a few
relapses over the years, she is now healthy.

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:31.439
Ultimately, she was lucky. Anorexia, bulimia, and other
eating and body dysmorphic disorders can kill.

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.439
Eating disorders are among the deadliest psychological
disorders, with some of the highest rates

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:39.830
of death directly attributable to the illness.
They slowly ruin the body, but, in order for

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:44.080
these conditions to be recognized and treated
successfully, they have to be understood as

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.080
disorders of the mind.

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.000
Here's some scary figures: According to the
National Eating Disorder Association, forty-two

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:04.770
percent of first to third grade girls want
to be thinner; eighty-one percent of ten year

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.390
olds are afraid of being fat; over half of
teenage girls and nearly a third of teenage

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:14.690
boys have used troubling weight control methods
like fasting, skipping meals, smoking, vomiting,

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:15.910
or taking laxatives.

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.580
The rate of new cases of eating disorders
in Western culture has been increasing since

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:24.980
the 1950's, and today in the US, an estimated
twenty million women and ten million men have

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.069
suffered from a clinically significant eating
disorder at some point in their lives.

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:33.200
But get this straight: we're not talking about
fad diets or lifestyle choices spurred by

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:38.900
vanity. Eating disorders are psychological
illnesses that often come with serious consequences.

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:44.440
These disorders tend to fall into three main categories:
anorexia, bulimia, and binge eating disorders.

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.780
Those suffering from anorexia nervosa, most
often adolescent females, essentially maintain

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:54.569
a starving diet and, eventually, and abnormally
low body weight. As in Lauren's case, anorexia

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:58.760
can begin as a diet that quickly spirals out
of control as a person becomes obsessed with

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.190
continued weight loss, all while still feeling
overweight.

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:06.830
Our old friend, the DSM V, actually delineates
two sub types of the disorder. The first involves

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:11.660
restriction, which usually consists of an
extremely low-calorie diet, excessive exercise,

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:16.400
or purging, like vomiting or the use of laxatives.
The second type is the binge/purge sub type,

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.890
which involves episodes of binge eating combined
with the restriction behavior.

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:23.480
As you can easily imagine, the physiological
effects of this psychological condition can

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:27.519
be devastating. As the body is denied crucial
nutrients, it slows down to conserve what

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:33.069
little energy it has, often resulting in abnormally
slow heart rate, loss of bone density, fatigue,

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:37.950
muscle weakness, hair loss, severe dehydration,
and an extremely low body mass index.

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:42.739
And it's that low body mass that's the defining
characteristic of anorexia nervosa - a refusal

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:47.440
to maintain a weight at or above what would
normally be considered minimally healthy.

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:51.860
If this condition persists, of course, it
can be deadly, which is why anorexia has what's

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:56.569
often estimated to be the highest mortality
rate of any psychiatric disorder.

00:03:56.569 --> 00:04:00.000
That might surprise you, given the host of
troubling disorders we've already covered

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.340
here on Crash Course Psychology, but mortality
rates associated with, say, major depression

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:10.170
or PTSD or schizophrenia tend to be the result
of secondary behavior, like suicide. But with

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:14.450
anorexia, the mortality rate is especially
high because people can die as a direct result

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:17.430
of extreme weight loss and physiological damage.

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:20.029
Another common eating disorder is bulimia
nervosa.

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:24.219
While anorexia is characterized primarily
by the refusal to maintain a minimal body

00:04:24.219 --> 00:04:28.819
weight, bulimia is not. People with bulimia
tend to maintain an apparently normal, or

00:04:28.819 --> 00:04:33.110
at least minimally healthy, body weight, but
alternate between binge eating, followed by

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:36.699
fasting or purging, often by vomiting or using
laxatives.

00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:42.249
A bulimic body may not be as obviously underweight
as an anorexic one, but that addictive cycle

00:04:42.249 --> 00:04:47.949
of binging and purging can seriously damage
the whole digestive system, leading to irregular

00:04:47.949 --> 00:04:51.999
heartbeat, inflammation of the esophagus and
mouth, tooth decay and staining, irregular

00:04:51.999 --> 00:04:56.259
bowel movements, peptic ulcers, pancreatitis,
and other organ damage.

00:04:56.259 --> 00:04:59.430
Sometimes the two diagnoses can be difficult
to discern, especially because someone may

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:03.939
shift back and forth between anorexic diagnostic
features and bulimic diagnostic features.

00:05:03.939 --> 00:05:08.479
The DSM V recently added a third category
called binge-eating disorder, which is marked

00:05:08.479 --> 00:05:14.619
by significant binge-eating, followed by emotional
distress, feelings of lack of control, disgust,

00:05:14.619 --> 00:05:17.259
or guilt, but without purging or fasting.

00:05:17.259 --> 00:05:21.789
Although sometimes triggered by stress or
a need for, or lack of, control, the presence

00:05:21.789 --> 00:05:26.919
of an eating disorder is not a tell-tale sign
of childhood sexual abuse, as was once commonly

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:30.550
thought. Instead, these disorders are often
predictive indicators of a person's feelings

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:36.610
of low self-worth, need to be perfect, falling short of
expectations, and concern with others perceptions.

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:40.860
Although the prevalence of bulimia and binge-eating
is similar among ethnic groups in the United

00:05:40.869 --> 00:05:46.139
States, anorexia is is much more common among
white women, often of higher socioeconomic status.

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:50.499
But the prevalence of these disorders is rising
in males, too. Today, between ten and twenty

00:05:50.499 --> 00:05:55.249
percent of people diagnosed with eating disorders
are men who feel the same pressure to attain

00:05:55.249 --> 00:05:58.849
what they imagine is physical perfection,
and that's worth noting.

00:05:58.849 --> 00:06:03.309
These disorders have strong cultural and gender
components; the so-called "ideal standard

00:06:03.309 --> 00:06:09.099
of beauty" varies wildly across cultures and
time, and thinness is far from a universal

00:06:09.099 --> 00:06:12.559
desire, especially in countries where malnutrition
and starvation are problems.

00:06:12.559 --> 00:06:17.210
But in the Western world, and increasingly
in other countries, thinness is a common pursuit.

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:22.429
And being bombarded with images of unrealistically
slender models and jacked celebrities has

00:06:22.429 --> 00:06:27.300
increased many people's dissatisfaction, or
even shame and disgust, with their own bodies.

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:30.270
These are all attitudes that can contribute
to eating disorders.

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:35.020
Some people have even had plastic surgery to
look more like Beyonce, or J-Lo, or...Barbie.

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:39.480
When taken to extremes, this kind of behavior starts
inching into the realm of body dysmorphic disorder.

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:43.520
Body dysmorphic disorder is another psychological
illness, one that centers on a person's obsession

00:06:43.529 --> 00:06:47.909
with physical flaws - either minor or just
imagined. Those suffering from this disorder

00:06:47.909 --> 00:06:52.789
often obsess over their appearance, often
staring into mirrors for hours, and feel distressed

00:06:52.789 --> 00:06:54.740
or ashamed by what they see.

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:58.069
Although it's often lumped in with the eating
disorders, our growing understanding of body

00:06:58.069 --> 00:07:02.729
dysmorphia suggests that it actually shares
some traits with obsessive-compulsive disorder,

00:07:02.729 --> 00:07:07.460
particularly the obsession with some imagined
bodily perfection and the compulsion to check

00:07:07.469 --> 00:07:10.509
oneself over and over to discern perceived
flaws.

00:07:10.509 --> 00:07:15.999
Not surprisingly, BDD and OCD may share some
similar neurophysiological features, although

00:07:15.999 --> 00:07:17.459
that's still being researched.

00:07:17.459 --> 00:07:22.110
People suffering from BDD may exercise excessively,
groom themselves excessively, or seek out

00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:27.409
extreme cosmetic procedures, but, unless treated,
they usually remain critical and unsatisfied

00:07:27.409 --> 00:07:31.569
with their looks, to the point of fearing
that they have a deformity.

00:07:31.569 --> 00:07:36.039
People with BDD may suffer from anxiety and
depression, start avoiding social situations,

00:07:36.039 --> 00:07:40.069
and stay home for fear that others will notice
and judge their appearance negatively.

00:07:40.069 --> 00:07:43.740
Obviously, this causes a lot of emotional
distress and dysfunction. Some bodybuilders

00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:48.929
suffer from a particular type of BDD called
muscle dysmorphia, sort of the opposite of

00:07:48.929 --> 00:07:52.349
anorexia, where they become obsessed with
the notion that they aren't muscular enough,

00:07:52.349 --> 00:07:54.499
even if they're ripping shirts like the Hulk.

00:07:54.499 --> 00:07:58.899
And again, this isn't mere vanity; people
suffering from body dysmorphia disorder look

00:07:58.899 --> 00:08:03.709
in the mirror and often see a distorted, even
grotesque, image in their reflection.

00:08:03.709 --> 00:08:05.719
So, how do these disorders come about?

00:08:05.719 --> 00:08:08.330
Well, to be honest, we still have a lot of
dots to connect.

00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:11.800
Neurologically, there are a few compelling
clues. In the case of eating disorders, for

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:15.729
example, research has long suggested that
neurotransmitters like serotonin and dopamine

00:08:15.729 --> 00:08:16.679
may play a role.

00:08:16.679 --> 00:08:21.089
Dopamine is involved in regions of the brain
connected to hunger and eating, like the hypothalamus

00:08:21.089 --> 00:08:24.989
and nucleus accumbens, and some research has
found that binge eating appears to alter the

00:08:24.989 --> 00:08:28.909
regulation of dopamine production in a way
that can reinforce further binging.

00:08:28.909 --> 00:08:32.550
The result is a neurological pattern that
can resemble drug addiction, although the

00:08:32.550 --> 00:08:34.930
addiction comparison is still pretty controversial.

00:08:34.930 --> 00:08:38.430
Genetics appear to play a role, too, as there
seems to be increased risk among genetic relatives

00:08:38.430 --> 00:08:40.310
with eating disorders as compared to controls.

00:08:40.310 --> 00:08:44.680
But a lot of attention is also being paid
to environmental and familial factors, particularly

00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:49.370
the behavioral modeling and learning processes
that shape how we think about ourselves and

00:08:49.370 --> 00:08:53.940
our bodies. Specifically, children who grow
up observing problematic or unhealthy eating

00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:58.620
behavior in parents may be at higher risk
for developing an eating disorder. And explicitly

00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:02.790
learning unreasonable or unhealthy values
about your weight or your shape from your

00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:06.620
family, and definitely from your peers, can
have a powerful effect.

00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:10.280
Eating and body dysmorphic disorders are serious
business, but they are treatable --

00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:11.760
and perhaps even preventable.

00:09:11.769 --> 00:09:16.430
If cultural learning contributes to how we
eat and how we want to look, then maybe education

00:09:16.430 --> 00:09:20.879
can help increase our acceptance of our own
appearance, and be more accepting of others.

00:09:20.879 --> 00:09:25.190
Today, you learned about the symptoms and
sub types of anorexia, bulimia, and binge-eating

00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:29.910
disorder, as well as various types of body
dysmorphic disorder, and some of the physiological

00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:31.860
and environmental roots of these conditions.
