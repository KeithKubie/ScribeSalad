00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:03.280
What’s that in the sky?

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:05.180
Is that a bird?

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:06.180
Superman?

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:07.180
Chemtrails?

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:08.180
Cloud seeding?

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:09.830
What the hell is cloud seeding?

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:14.630
Hey guys, Julia here for DNews

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:16.820
Humans like to make it rain.

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:21.100
From rain dances to Storm in X-men we’ve
always dreamed of controlling the weather.

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:24.890
Apart from rituals and science fiction, science
might have found a way.

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:27.419
Clouds are made of millions of tiny water
droplets.

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:30.430
But these droplets hang out in the air unless
they stick to tiny particles.

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:32.789
Then they become heavy enough to fall.

00:00:32.789 --> 00:00:35.050
Normally these particles are things like dust.

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:39.079
A study published in the journal Geophysical
Research Letters found that pollen might help

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:40.520
form clouds too.

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.410
Previously scientists thought that pollen
grains were too large to have any effect on

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:45.410
weather.

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:49.789
Yet this new research suggests that when pollen
gets wet it breaks apart into smaller pieces.

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:52.840
And these smaller pieces could make the building
blocks of clouds.

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:57.199
So it seems like a small leap of logic to
find a way we could help the process along.

00:00:57.199 --> 00:00:59.440
Maybe we could make clouds out of thin air.

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:00.649
Sound like science fiction?

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:01.980
Well it’s already a thing.

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.799
It’s been a thing in the American west for
decades already.

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:10.140
In California, water agencies and utilities
dish out $3-to-5 million bucks a year on it.

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.410
Cloud seeding produces nucleation, when water
particles attach to other small particles

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:15.610
and condenses.

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:18.890
Basically it makes water vapor form clump
into a cloud.

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.590
If it gets heavy enough, it falls to the ground
as rain.

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.391
One study published in the Journal of Applied
Meteorology and Climatology found that this

00:01:25.391 --> 00:01:28.280
process can improve rainfall by up to 15%.

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.860
While that doesn’t seem like a lot, this
technique proved effective in a desert in

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:33.860
2010.

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:38.540
An 11 million dollar project produced 52 rain
storms in the Abu Dhabi desert.

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:43.219
In this case, scientists working for the United
Arab government designed ionizers, which produced

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:44.219
charged particles.

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:47.280
As they rose into the atmosphere, these particles
collected dust.

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.210
When water particles condensed around the
dust, it formed clouds… which turned into

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.210
rain.

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:54.049
Worried your wedding day might be a little
wet?

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:57.789
Well, London based luxury travel company,
Oliver’s Travels can help.

00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:02.260
they’ll have a pilot fly near your event
location and sprinkle a few silver iodide

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.080
particles into the air a few days before the
shindig.

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:07.890
These particles, look very close to ice on
a molecular level.

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.320
So they make water condense and well you get
the idea.

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:11.320
Rain happens.

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:14.140
This clears the air, so clouds won’t build
up on your big day.

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.230
Although prepare to cough up a pretty penny.

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:17.230
The service can run $150,000.

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:22.690
I know what you’re thinking - can we just
make a bunch of rainclouds and end the drought?

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.750
Well there are some skeptics, one study published
in the journal Atmospheric Research found

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.580
some cloud seeding attempts aren’t all that
successful.

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:33.300
Looking over a 50 year period, the researchers
conclude that an increase in rainfall was

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.880
the result of chance, not cloud seeding.

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.330
But other scientists think it could tame hurricanes.

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:42.800
In a study published in the journal Atmospheric
Science Letters researchers create climate

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:47.270
models to understand how creating clouds could
cool down the oceans.

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:49.730
Hurricanes get whipped by warm waters in the
ocean.

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:53.230
As sea surface temperatures heat up, hurricanes
get more energy.

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:57.490
By creating clouds above ocean hot spots,
the clouds could act like reflectors, bouncing

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:59.570
the sun’s energy back into space.

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:03.800
But on the other hand, such clouds might reduce
rainfall in the Amazon or cause other unintended

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:04.800
consequences.

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.750
Which is the main problem with the whole cloud
seeding thing.

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:10.080
You can’t predict the weather, even if you
make it.

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:11.490
So more research is needed.

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:15.430
So it might not save us from a drought, but
could the ocean save us?

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:17.239
