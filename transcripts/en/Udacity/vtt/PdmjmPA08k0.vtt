00:00:00.783 --> 00:00:04.692
You're probably used to seeing
in writing the code here,

00:00:04.692 --> 00:00:07.896
to create an object,
an array, and function.

00:00:07.896 --> 00:00:09.765
These are in the literal format.

00:00:09.765 --> 00:00:12.974
These lines down here produce
the same end result, but

00:00:12.974 --> 00:00:14.870
are in the constructor format.

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:18.620
The constructor format for each of these
is not recommended for several reasons.

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:22.547
It's not readable, it can be harder
to work with, and it's slower.

00:00:22.547 --> 00:00:26.913
But the constructor function does offer
one benefit over a function literal.

00:00:26.913 --> 00:00:30.036
It can dynamically create
a function at run time.

00:00:30.036 --> 00:00:33.452
Remember that underscores template
functions job is to construct

00:00:33.452 --> 00:00:34.124
a function.

00:00:34.124 --> 00:00:37.245
It does so by using
the constructor function format.

00:00:37.245 --> 00:00:41.703
Here is a function that takes two
numbers and adds them together.

00:00:41.703 --> 00:00:43.980
It's written in the literal format.

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.018
This function does the same thing, but

00:00:46.018 --> 00:00:48.376
it is written using
a constructor function.

00:00:48.376 --> 00:00:52.581
The last argument to a constructor
function is the body of the function.

00:00:52.581 --> 00:00:57.201
Any arguments before the last one will
become parameters for the function.

00:00:57.201 --> 00:00:59.833
This makes constructor
functions really handy,

00:00:59.833 --> 00:01:03.540
because they can create functions
with a dynamically supplied body.

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:08.335
So addr1 results in 3 and
addr2 gives us 7.

00:01:08.335 --> 00:01:14.152
This make function accepts one argument
and returns a newly created function.

00:01:14.152 --> 00:01:17.577
I'll call make and
pass to it the string fun.

00:01:17.577 --> 00:01:19.076
This returns a new function.

00:01:19.076 --> 00:01:22.342
This is fun function is waiting
to be called with some data.

00:01:22.342 --> 00:01:27.089
If I pass biking, I'll get the string
biking is fun returned to me.

00:01:27.089 --> 00:01:30.750
Passing in climbing, or
broccoli, makes them fun too.
