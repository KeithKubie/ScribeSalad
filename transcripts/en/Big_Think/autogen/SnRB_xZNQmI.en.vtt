theoretical models that represent

theoretical models that represent

theoretical models that represent
real-life situations but like any model

real-life situations but like any model
 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:21.280
real-life situations but like any model
they simplify the situation and we try

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:21.290
they simplify the situation and we try
 

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:23.830
they simplify the situation and we try
to derive consequences of our

assumptions it's a mathematical model so
 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:31.359

we deduce what our assumptions indicate

we deduce what our assumptions indicate
 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:34.870
we deduce what our assumptions indicate
we prove theorems as they're called but

we prove theorems as they're called but
 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:36.760
we prove theorems as they're called but
we also ask about the applicability of

should they vote for Nader who had no
 

00:01:56.689 --> 00:01:59.080

Democrat Al Gore and in some cases they
were torn and one consequence of being

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750
were torn and one consequence of being
 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:13.809
were torn and one consequence of being
torn is you don't vote at all you can't

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:13.819
torn is you don't vote at all you can't
 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:16.510

make up your mind but some swish and

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:16.520
make up your mind but some swish and
 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:20.170

some did not switch of course the major

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180
some did not switch of course the major
 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:21.990

consequence was that enough

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000

stuck with Nader so that he by all

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610
stuck with Nader so that he by all

accounts affected the election outcome

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:31.570
accounts affected the election outcome
 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:34.320
accounts affected the election outcome
in particular in Florida Bush in the end

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330
in particular in Florida Bush in the end
 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.170
in particular in Florida Bush in the end
got about five hundred one beat gore by

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180
got about five hundred one beat gore by
 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.590
got about five hundred one beat gore by
about five hundred votes but there were

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:40.600
about five hundred votes but there were
 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.540
about five hundred votes but there were
ninety seven thousand native supporters

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:42.550
ninety seven thousand native supporters
 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:46.650
ninety seven thousand native supporters
in Florida and if most of them had gone

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660
in Florida and if most of them had gone
 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:50.790
in Florida and if most of them had gone
for Gore as a second choice then Gore

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:50.800
for Gore as a second choice then Gore
 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.500
for Gore as a second choice then Gore
would have won by tens of thousands of

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510
would have won by tens of thousands of
 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.270
would have won by tens of thousands of
votes instead of losing by about five

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280
votes instead of losing by about five
 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.130
votes instead of losing by about five
hundred that would have changed the

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140
hundred that would have changed the
 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:59.670
hundred that would have changed the
outcome in the country as a whole and we

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680
outcome in the country as a whole and we
 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.710
outcome in the country as a whole and we
would have had a different president so

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720
would have had a different president so
 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.680
would have had a different president so
that's a good example of a so-called

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690
that's a good example of a so-called
 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:08.449
that's a good example of a so-called
spoiler somebody who can't win who

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459
spoiler somebody who can't win who
 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:11.460
spoiler somebody who can't win who
changes the election outcome so those

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470
changes the election outcome so those
 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:13.199
changes the election outcome so those
are the kinds of situations that we

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:13.209
are the kinds of situations that we
 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:14.640
are the kinds of situations that we
study and I think these models are very

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650
study and I think these models are very
 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:19.480
study and I think these models are very
helpful in understanding them

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:19.490
 
 

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:22.540
 
well I think what I just suggested about

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:22.550
well I think what I just suggested about
 

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:25.480
well I think what I just suggested about
the 2000 election is the example if

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:25.490
the 2000 election is the example if
 

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:28.690
the 2000 election is the example if
you'll feel that the consequences of

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700
you'll feel that the consequences of
 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:31.090
you'll feel that the consequences of
electing borscht let's say you're a

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:31.100
electing borscht let's say you're a
 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:35.650

Democrat filed after leaning are

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:35.660
Democrat filed after leaning are
 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:40.030
Democrat filed after leaning are
sufficiently problematic then and you

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.040
sufficiently problematic then and you
 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:41.950
sufficiently problematic then and you
were native supporter then you might

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:41.960
were native supporter then you might
 

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:44.020
were native supporter then you might
well switch that would be the rational

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:44.030
well switch that would be the rational
 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:45.850
well switch that would be the rational
choice but if you think neither

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:45.860
choice but if you think neither
 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:50.770
choice but if you think neither
candidate was very good as Nader argued

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:50.780
candidate was very good as Nader argued
 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:52.450
candidate was very good as Nader argued
they were both kind of the same cloth

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:52.460
they were both kind of the same cloth
 

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:56.230
they were both kind of the same cloth
then you would not switch and your vote

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:56.240
then you would not switch and your vote
 

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:59.010
then you would not switch and your vote
would be more a protest vote so

00:03:59.010 --> 00:03:59.020
would be more a protest vote so
 

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:01.750
would be more a protest vote so
rationality may move voters in different

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:01.760
rationality may move voters in different
 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:03.100
rationality may move voters in different
directions depending on their

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:03.110
directions depending on their
 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:05.230
directions depending on their
preferences their goals you want to just

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:05.240
preferences their goals you want to just
 

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:07.900
preferences their goals you want to just
protest I do want to affect the election

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:07.910
protest I do want to affect the election
 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:09.520
protest I do want to affect the election
outcome and try to affect the election

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:09.530
outcome and try to affect the election
 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:11.950
