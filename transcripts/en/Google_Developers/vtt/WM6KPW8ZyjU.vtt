&gt;&gt; BRUCE: Now, I want to show and tell you
about another--actually, I want to introduce

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:08.690
Jason to tell you about another real world
example of a CodeSplitting success story,

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:11.830
the next slide Jason Bright from MediaBeacon.
Jason.

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:15.360
&gt;&gt; BRIGHT: Thanks.
&gt;&gt; BRUCE: Please.

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.630
&gt;&gt; BRIGHT: So, I'm Jason Bright. I'm the founder
of MediaBeacon, and we're an enterprise digital

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:27.550
asset management company. And we provide enterprise
asset management to customers, which in general

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:32.879
at more than 100 employees and have millions
of files to distribute among those employees.

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:39.730
And we decided to go with GWT as our interface
technology for many reasons. And I could talk

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:44.699
about it for awhile, but I think it's easier
to show it. So, if we jump to the MediaBeacon

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:53.339
server, we can log on and you see that it's
a widget based interface that has, literally,

00:00:53.339 --> 00:00:58.299
hundreds of widgets which are available. And
you can place all the widgets on the pages

00:00:58.299 --> 00:01:04.250
and then you can share this workspace with
different users. And we can do some really

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:10.869
magical things with GWT, so I can do things
like drag and drop, and I can hover and expand

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:18.170
folders, and there is no flash on this page.
So, this allows you to do all the highly interactive

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:24.579
things that you expect of the desktop in a
simple web interface and then search your--and

00:01:24.579 --> 00:01:30.150
MediaBeacon is unique because it has strongly
attached metadata that's written in to the

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:35.280
assets. So as the assets move, you know everything
about them. Now, one of the things that we

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.859
did is we put all these highly interactive
widgets that have to be able to drag and drop

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:44.999
and send message to each other. You'll see
when I click on one, it updates the rest.

00:01:44.999 --> 00:01:49.880
So, we're doing a lot of GWT magic between
these individual widgets. And when I want

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.999
to configure the interface, I literally have
hundreds and hundreds of widgets to select

00:01:54.999 --> 00:02:01.999
from. In addition to that, we use Open Syndication
and OpenSocial to get an even larger set.

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:09.729
So, let me grab one from OpenSocial, and I'll
go on iGoogle for a second. Grab an iGoogle

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:17.490
Widget. I use Google Docs a lot, so I'll just
grab my gadget. I'll go click a link. Grab

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:23.410
the URL, copy it. And then, go ahead and go
into my Syndication Widget, and I'm going

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:29.150
to paste it right in there. And as soon as
it comes up, I can tell that it's not supposed

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:35.950
to have as much size as it thinks it wants.
So, I can--my hand won't stop shaking. I guess

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:43.680
I am nervous. And I can say how large it supposed
to be, and then I can save. Now, I'm happy

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:50.160
with that and I can bring that to a point
of prominence, up here. And then, I can take

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:57.980
my date search widget over there and I can
name it, My Docs, great. So now, I have an

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:04.360
interface that has both OpenSocial Widgets
and highly connected widgets. And now, here's

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:12.010
the problem. The problem was that this codebase
kept getting bigger and bigger, because GWT

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:16.050
let us go farther and farther and be more
and more aggressive with what we can develop.

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:25.970
And so, if we go back to my slides, the problem
was we got up to 1.5meg before you saw the

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:29.421
lagging screen. Because everything that had
to be highly interactive and had to allow

00:03:29.421 --> 00:03:33.730
drag and drop and events pass in between each
other, it had to be part of that initial download.

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:39.480
So it got incredibly painful, and before you
could see the lagging screen, most people

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:47.840
click away. And so, if--when we put CodeSplitting
in, we were able to jump from this 1.5meg

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:56.990
to 109k compress. So, that's smaller than
the logo next to the login window is. And

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:01.660
we're not making the logo smaller, just so
you know. All right. And so, the great part

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:06.050
is as I was able to gain all of this improvement
and what's great is that I didn't have to

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:10.830
work very hard for it, relatively speaking.
So, if you look at the next slide, you'll

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:15.570
see that we had at about 16 lines of code,
because our application is all based on widgets,

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:19.870
since the widgets know when to load. The widgets
are a part of context when you switch from

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:26.010
context to context. So, we simply ran--added
a bunch of runAsyncs and we're able to gain

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:34.410
1.4meg per 16 lines of code, which is a pretty
great savings. So, in summary, MediaBeacon

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:41.600
is a real world application. It had a very
large number of functions that had to be interrelated.

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:46.320
The widgets weren't on the screen at the same
time. This is a real world example were CodeSplitting

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:52.030
allowed us deliver the functionality that
we need without having the users have an unfortunate

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:56.070
experience, and now they think it's really,
really perky. So, we're very proud of the

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:59.540
CodeSplitting and we're very happy, the fact,
that we didn't have to do much for it. And

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:06.510
we think that this--that we chose GWT out
of all the other industry standards and we

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:11.971
think that GWT, it has really, in an instant,
made us an industry leader ahead of all the

00:05:11.971 --> 00:05:17.810
other products, because of the Toolkit we
used. So, thank you. Thanks very much, Bruce.

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:18.810
Thank you.
