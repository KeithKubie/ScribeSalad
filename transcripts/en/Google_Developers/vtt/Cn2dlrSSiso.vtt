00:00:05.693 --> 00:00:08.109
LAURENCE MORONEY: So Billy,
great to have you on the show.

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:10.700
I mean, it's amazing some of
the stuff that we've been doing.

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:12.921
We've had a couple of shows
like with the AIY folks.

00:00:12.921 --> 00:00:15.379
And now we've got the person
who's leading the whole thing.

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:17.925
So, can you tell us all about
it and what brought it about?

00:00:17.925 --> 00:00:19.300
BILLY RUTLEDGE:
Yeah, absolutely.

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:20.440
Thanks for having me.

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:22.106
It's been a while
since we last chatted.

00:00:22.106 --> 00:00:24.252
So it's good to be here
and have the opportunity

00:00:24.252 --> 00:00:25.960
to talk about some of
the work that we're

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.220
doing with the maker community.

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.400
AIY actually started
last summer when

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.100
we were thinking about
how to better engage

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.860
the maker community with
what Google has to offer.

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:42.610
And I think everyone has really
heard Sundar at this point talk

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:45.490
about how Google is
a AI first company.

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:47.710
And so we felt that
getting some of the AI

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:50.740
that we have available, you
know, from Google Research,

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:53.862
and from our first party
product designs structured

00:00:53.862 --> 00:00:56.320
in a way that could work with
makers would be a great idea.

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:57.320
LAURENCE MORONEY: Right.

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.550
BILLY RUTLEDGE: And so we came
up with AI combined with DIY,

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:02.980
do it yourself, and created
the AIY Projects Initiative.

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:04.480
LAURENCE MORONEY:
So can you tell us

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:05.830
a little about
what the AIY does,

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:07.570
or at least the first
releases that you've done?

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:08.170
BILLY RUTLEDGE: Yeah, yeah.

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:08.720
For sure.

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.890
So what we started with
was actually a survey

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:13.040
to the maker community.

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:14.800
So, at the beginning
of the year,

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.272
we thought, before we
jump too far into this,

00:01:17.272 --> 00:01:18.730
maybe we should
spend a little time

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:21.760
and actually see
what do makers want?

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:24.970
And how do we engage the maker
community in the right way?

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:26.620
Rather than just
designing something

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:28.770
and throwing it out there
and seeing if it works.

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:29.645
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK.

00:01:29.645 --> 00:01:31.750
BILLY RUTLEDGE: And
so, at the end of 2016,

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:34.810
we released our
first maker survey.

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:37.860
We asked some good questions
to learn more about makers.

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.110
What are the different groups?

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:42.220
What are the different segments
within the maker community?

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:44.710
As well as what is
their perception

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:46.050
of artificial intelligence?

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:48.760
And you know, is it easy to use?

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:49.760
Is it hard to use?

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:53.120
And if you had your
hands or your--

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:55.685
the ability to access AI,
what would you do with it?

00:01:55.685 --> 00:01:56.560
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK.

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.180
BILLY RUTLEDGE: And we got some
really good information back.

00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:59.138
LAURENCE MORONEY: Cool.

00:01:59.138 --> 00:02:00.822
And then, this came
out of that, right?

00:02:00.822 --> 00:02:01.780
BILLY RUTLEDGE: It did.

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:02.279
Yeah.

00:02:02.279 --> 00:02:06.160
Looking at the survey
results, we saw probably

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:07.430
maybe two main groups.

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:10.270
One is professional and
amateur makers, mostly

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:12.390
engineering folks that
have a full time job,

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:17.230
but experiment with maker
tools and maker class hardware

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:18.520
on the side.

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.110
Prototyping a new
idea for a problem

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.120
they're trying to
solve or possibly

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.730
an idea for a startup company
that they would like to create

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:26.770
in the next few years.

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:28.720
As well as, you
know, students that

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.410
are learning about computer
science for the first time.

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:38.020
And we heard from them that
AI is sort of perceived

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:43.780
as hard, difficult, requires
expensive, specialized hardware

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:45.490
and specialized software.

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:47.712
And we thought right
away, well, gosh, we

00:02:47.712 --> 00:02:48.670
want to demystify that.

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.610
Because its actually not that
hard to get started with.

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:54.970
And there's so much that
you can do on this you know,

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:58.150
affordable, capable, maker
class hardware that's available

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.650
today.

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:59.580
LAURENCE MORONEY:
And at Google, we

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.190
have like, a lot of cloud
services with the AI

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.734
behind them.

00:03:01.734 --> 00:03:03.400
BILLY RUTLEDGE: A lot
of cloud services.

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:04.730
LAURENCE MORONEY: Like the voice
recognition and all that kind

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:07.600
of stuff, which naturally lends
itself to something like this.

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:08.600
BILLY RUTLEDGE: It does.

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.050
And that's really why
we started with voice,

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:14.800
is because in the last,
I would say, year or two,

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.140
I think generally
people have become

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:21.490
a lot more familiar with and
interested in using voice user

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:22.480
interfaces.

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.685
Things like Google
Home or Amazon Alexa,

00:03:24.685 --> 00:03:27.420
or voice capabilities
in your car.

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:31.480
It feels more natural to
engage with computers using--

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.722
using what's built in, the
English language in this case,

00:03:34.722 --> 00:03:37.180
rather than having to learn
approach a programming language

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:40.240
or work with a button interface.

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:42.820
And when we did survey
the makers, you know,

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:45.220
we clearly heard that voice
recognition and voice user

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:46.690
interface was one
of the top things

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:47.898
that they were interested in.

00:03:47.898 --> 00:03:50.820
And so, for that reason, we
decided to start with voice.

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:51.820
LAURENCE MORONEY: Right.

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:54.390
And people were familiar with
Google Cardboard for like, VR,

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:54.640
right?

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:55.470
BILLY RUTLEDGE:
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:56.830
LAURENCE MORONEY: You went
with the cardboard metaphor.

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:57.788
BILLY RUTLEDGE: We did.

00:03:57.788 --> 00:04:00.289
So we stole a page out of the
cardboard VR team's playbook.

00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:02.080
LAURENCE MORONEY: It's
a good page to take.

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:03.121
BILLY RUTLEDGE: Isn't it?

00:04:03.121 --> 00:04:04.650
It worked out quite well.

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:07.600
And we thought, you know, being
a part of the maker community

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:10.540
is not only making things
affordable and interesting,

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:13.540
but also just enough
scaffolding for them to learn

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:15.316
about the technology inside.

00:04:15.316 --> 00:04:16.690
Because we feel
that makers would

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:19.798
probably you know, have
their own vision for a thing

00:04:19.798 --> 00:04:22.089
that they're building, whether
it's a toy Tyrannosaurus

00:04:22.089 --> 00:04:23.867
rex, or a coffee robot machine.

00:04:23.867 --> 00:04:26.450
LAURENCE MORONEY: I'd like one
of those coffee robot machines.

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:28.830
BILLY RUTLEDGE: I know, right?

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:32.560
If we had more expensive
or sophisticated forum,

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.260
we thought that might
be a barrier to people

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.597
exploring the technology,
which is really the purpose.

00:04:37.597 --> 00:04:39.430
LAURENCE MORONEY: I
work with a lot of kids.

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:41.620
And to me, always
the barrier to entry

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:42.896
is either complexity or cost.

00:04:42.896 --> 00:04:43.770
BILLY RUTLEDGE: Yeah.

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:44.020
LAURENCE MORONEY: Right?

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:46.640
So it's like, you know, if
you can reduce complexity,

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:47.320
as this does--

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:47.530
BILLY RUTLEDGE: Yes.

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:49.030
LAURENCE MORONEY:
--instead of like,

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:52.100
having a, like a metal box,
and the components inside it.

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:54.070
And as you reduce
cost as well, it's

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:56.500
like, then that suddenly
makes it a whole lot easier.

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:58.584
And, I know you've had
overwhelming demand, right?

00:04:58.584 --> 00:04:59.583
BILLY RUTLEDGE: We have.

00:04:59.583 --> 00:05:01.750
Like you said, affordability
is a key factor

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:03.340
in doing something like this.

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:05.810
And again, make to our maker
survey for just a moment.

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:06.180
LAURENCE MORONEY: Sure.

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:08.471
BILLY RUTLEDGE: One of the
questions that we asked was,

00:05:08.471 --> 00:05:11.520
what computing platform and
what programming language

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:12.720
do you currently use?

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:17.220
And you know, by far, Raspberry
Pi and Linux and Python

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:20.030
and JavaScript were very
popular with the maker audience.

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:21.550
No surprise there.

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:23.610
And so, right away,
we decided to work

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:26.430
with Raspberry Pi
for our kit here,

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:28.445
and possibly what's coming next.

00:05:28.445 --> 00:05:29.320
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK.

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:30.876
Ooh.

00:05:30.876 --> 00:05:32.250
BILLY RUTLEDGE:
We'll share more.

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:34.380
And that helped keep
the price point down.

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:37.120
Because most makers already
have a Raspberry Pi.

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:40.350
And so if we could bundle all
the accessories needed in a fun

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:43.230
to assemble format, such
that they could put it

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:45.810
together and only spend
just a few dollars,

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:47.992
it makes it much
more-- much easier

00:05:47.992 --> 00:05:49.200
for them to get started with.

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:50.730
LAURENCE MORONEY: I mean,
for me, personally, I've

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:52.650
been playing with Raspberry
Pi for a couple of years.

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:54.358
But I just ended up
like, tinkering, just

00:05:54.358 --> 00:05:56.070
doing some various
software stuff.

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:57.600
And whenever it
was to do anything

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:01.530
in hardware or anything
exterior, I got scared.

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:03.240
But this was much
more approachable.

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:03.810
BILLY RUTLEDGE: Yeah.

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:04.810
LAURENCE MORONEY: Right?

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:06.685
And so, apparently, they
were really popular.

00:06:06.685 --> 00:06:07.893
BILLY RUTLEDGE: Very popular.

00:06:07.893 --> 00:06:09.360
So, to test the
waters, you know,

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:11.640
we had this information
from our survey

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:16.270
and from talking to makers at
events, maker fairs and such.

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:19.500
So we knew we wanted to do
a low cost kit for makers

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:21.820
based on Raspberry Pi.

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:24.090
And focus on voice
recognition capabilities

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:26.910
and how to build your
own voice user interface.

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:28.196
We put a few ideas together.

00:06:28.196 --> 00:06:30.570
And then we reached out the
Raspberry Pi, the foundation,

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:33.550
and asked Eben
Upton, the founder,

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:35.610
what's the best way
to get this in front

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:40.050
of your most interested
or passionate Raspberry Pi

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:41.190
hackers?

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:45.240
And he suggested, well, Magpie
Magazine is our monthly journal

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:48.300
that showcases projects that you
can do with your Raspberry Pi.

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:48.990
So I don't know.

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:51.030
Why don't we send a
few of your voice kits

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:53.432
out to our subscribers and
see what the appetite is?

00:06:53.432 --> 00:06:54.390
LAURENCE MORONEY: Nice.

00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:55.410
And that's what this is?

00:06:55.410 --> 00:06:56.576
BILLY RUTLEDGE: It is, yeah.

00:06:56.576 --> 00:06:57.930
So this is-- this is the--

00:06:57.930 --> 00:06:59.480
this is the unit that we
actually ended up with.

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:00.360
It started off with--

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:00.930
LAURENCE MORONEY:
It's pretty cool.

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:02.100
BILLY RUTLEDGE:
We would send out

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:03.510
some of the PCB's
that are inside

00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:04.890
of this to the subscribers.

00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:07.110
But it quickly snowballed
into, why don't we

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:09.240
just build a kit and
brand it Magpie and Google

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:10.510
and put everything inside?

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:12.510
And that's really
where we landed.

00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:15.750
So we structured
the kit like this,

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:18.600
and made it look like
the Magpie Magazine.

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:24.370
And inside, you know, is
the actual magazine itself,

00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:28.530
which has, I don't know,
35 or 40 pages about

00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:29.370
building this kit.

00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:32.310
So it's actually the instruction
set for assembly usage

00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:33.830
and how to hack the kit.

00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:34.950
LAURENCE MORONEY: Oh ice.

00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:36.700
BILLY RUTLEDGE: And
then, you know, inside

00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:39.300
we also have the cardboard
form that you fold together.

00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:42.510
So this is really fun to
fold and snap into place.

00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:43.010
Yeah.

00:07:43.010 --> 00:07:44.110
LAURENCE MORONEY: That's
before, this is after.

00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:45.318
BILLY RUTLEDGE: That's after.

00:07:45.318 --> 00:07:48.780
And then, the PCB's
that go along with it.

00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:49.770
This is the hat--

00:07:49.770 --> 00:07:52.860
voice hat, which has a
microphone and amplifier audio

00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:54.210
output.

00:07:54.210 --> 00:07:55.620
And then the actual
microphone is

00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:57.870
separate with an extension
cable that goes back

00:07:57.870 --> 00:08:00.780
to the voice hat, as well as
the speaker and the activation

00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:01.470
button.

00:08:01.470 --> 00:08:03.490
And just an interesting thing.

00:08:03.490 --> 00:08:05.280
The microphone
board, we actually

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:09.984
made it a separate board which
attaches back to the main hat.

00:08:09.984 --> 00:08:11.400
Because we felt
makers, as they're

00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:13.180
exploring creative forms
with what they're doing,

00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:15.750
may want to place the microphone
in an interesting place.

00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:19.170
Like, maybe in the head of
that tyrannosaurus rex form,

00:08:19.170 --> 00:08:20.790
or in the front of
that coffee robot.

00:08:20.790 --> 00:08:21.748
LAURENCE MORONEY: Nice.

00:08:21.748 --> 00:08:23.940
BILLY RUTLEDGE: Rather than
have the whole computing

00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:26.520
platform, you know, stuck
to that side of their--

00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:27.900
LAURENCE MORONEY: So a lot of
thought has gone into this?

00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:28.775
BILLY RUTLEDGE: Yeah.

00:08:28.775 --> 00:08:32.159
The more we got started with
it, the more involved we became.

00:08:32.159 --> 00:08:33.960
And we really wanted
to put together

00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:36.450
a kit that has good
value for the price.

00:08:36.450 --> 00:08:40.860
And it prompts people to
explore their inner creativity

00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:43.840
about what they would make
with a voice user interface.

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:45.590
LAURENCE MORONEY: And
I know you've worked

00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:47.302
a lot with people in education.

00:08:47.302 --> 00:08:48.510
BILLY RUTLEDGE: Well we have.

00:08:48.510 --> 00:08:50.580
And I guess it should
be no surprise.

00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:53.460
But, we started
out really trying

00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:56.160
to get Google artificial
intelligence in front of this,

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:58.590
you know, amateur and
professional maker audiences

00:08:58.590 --> 00:09:00.120
I described before.

00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:02.700
But as the kits
went out, you know,

00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:05.070
more and more demand of,
hey, I'd like to get one too.

00:09:05.070 --> 00:09:07.860
And eventually, Raspberry
Pi or the Magpie

00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:09.480
put them up on their
website for sale,

00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:11.890
and they sold out right away.

00:09:11.890 --> 00:09:15.990
But what we found was, so
many teachers and school club

00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:19.530
organizers saw the kit and
felt it would be a great way

00:09:19.530 --> 00:09:22.470
to introduce their students
to computer science,

00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:25.220
connected devices,
artificial intelligence.

00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:28.480
And so, yeah, a lot of
demand from schools in order

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:30.450
to get that started
with Raspberry Pi.

00:09:30.450 --> 00:09:31.530
LAURENCE MORONEY: When you
first told me about this,

00:09:31.530 --> 00:09:33.160
I said, I need to
put that to the test.

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:33.490
BILLY RUTLEDGE: Yeah.

00:09:33.490 --> 00:09:34.020
LAURENCE MORONEY:
You know, just see

00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:35.790
what it be like before we
shoot something like this.

00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:37.230
So, to put it to
the test, we gave it

00:09:37.230 --> 00:09:38.580
to some high school
students to see

00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:39.600
what they would build with it.

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:40.020
BILLY RUTLEDGE: Right.

00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:41.260
LAURENCE MORONEY: They
built some amazing things.

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:41.820
Shall we take a look?

00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:43.486
BILLY RUTLEDGE: Yeah,
let's have a look.

00:09:43.486 --> 00:09:44.540
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:09:44.540 --> 00:09:45.040
- Cool.

00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:47.110
- We can also tell
him to turn left.

00:09:47.110 --> 00:09:47.760
Turn left.

00:09:51.815 --> 00:09:52.315
- Nice.

00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:55.440
- Stop.

00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:01.490
- Pawn to D5.

00:10:01.490 --> 00:10:03.673
- D5 makes D5 your move.

00:10:03.673 --> 00:10:04.172
- Yup.

00:10:04.172 --> 00:10:07.200
And just takes,
and then you go on.

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:10.080
- Shop for a New
York Mets jersey.

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:12.350
Now she's done.

00:10:12.350 --> 00:10:12.850
- Candies.

00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:18.430
- Giving you two candies.

00:10:18.430 --> 00:10:20.510
- So we get plural as well.

00:10:20.510 --> 00:10:21.090
Nice.

00:10:21.090 --> 00:10:23.490
Red is my favorite, so I'm
glad I got a couple of reds.

00:10:23.490 --> 00:10:23.910
[END PLAYBACK]

00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:26.076
What struck me about that
was like, how some of them

00:10:26.076 --> 00:10:28.100
were so inventive with
external hardware.

00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:28.590
BILLY RUTLEDGE: Yeah.

00:10:28.590 --> 00:10:29.590
LAURENCE MORONEY: Right?

00:10:29.590 --> 00:10:32.067
So I thought like, with only
five days to work, with right?

00:10:32.067 --> 00:10:33.900
They might hack some
Python scripts together

00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:34.350
and stuff like that.

00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:35.110
And some of them did.

00:10:35.110 --> 00:10:36.010
And it was really impressive.

00:10:36.010 --> 00:10:36.410
BILLY RUTLEDGE: Sure.

00:10:36.410 --> 00:10:36.590
Yeah.

00:10:36.590 --> 00:10:38.070
LAURENCE MORONEY: But
there was like that one--

00:10:38.070 --> 00:10:40.320
that one team that they
built that little hexapod.

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:40.750
BILLY RUTLEDGE: Yeah.

00:10:40.750 --> 00:10:42.500
That little spider
that's crawling around.

00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:43.310
Amazing, isn't it?

00:10:43.310 --> 00:10:44.007
Very cool.

00:10:44.007 --> 00:10:46.590
LAURENCE MORONEY: So it's like,
they took three server motors,

00:10:46.590 --> 00:10:48.673
and then they had like a
little Bluetooth circuit.

00:10:48.673 --> 00:10:51.275
And then they used this
to do voice recognition.

00:10:51.275 --> 00:10:52.650
BILLY RUTLEDGE:
For voice control

00:10:52.650 --> 00:10:53.670
the motion of the robot.

00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:54.000
Yeah.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.125
LAURENCE MORONEY: And then
because the Raspberry Pi

00:10:56.125 --> 00:10:57.506
and the image,
the AIY image, had

00:10:57.506 --> 00:10:59.130
like, the Bluetooth
drivers on it, they

00:10:59.130 --> 00:11:00.960
were able to just send
Bluetooth commands over.

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:01.940
And the effect of that was--

00:11:01.940 --> 00:11:02.340
BILLY RUTLEDGE: Wow.

00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:04.860
I'm glad to hear it was easy
for them to get started.

00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:05.940
LAURENCE MORONEY:
I didn't believe

00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:07.410
they would be able
to do it so quickly.

00:11:07.410 --> 00:11:07.620
BILLY RUTLEDGE: Yeah.

00:11:07.620 --> 00:11:08.430
Five days, you said?

00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:09.400
LAURENCE MORONEY:
Yeah, five days.

00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:09.790
BILLY RUTLEDGE: Amazing.

00:11:09.790 --> 00:11:11.070
LAURENCE MORONEY:
It was really cool.

00:11:11.070 --> 00:11:12.150
And then part of
the other feedback

00:11:12.150 --> 00:11:14.460
that I thought was really
neat was around Python.

00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:17.030
Because some of these kids
had never used Python before.

00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:18.697
And so it was a pretty
good choice for--

00:11:18.697 --> 00:11:20.154
BILLY RUTLEDGE: To
get them started

00:11:20.154 --> 00:11:21.520
with Python programming.

00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:22.478
LAURENCE MORONEY: Yeah.

00:11:22.478 --> 00:11:24.180
And it's-- by open
sourcing everything,

00:11:24.180 --> 00:11:25.556
and it's on your website, right?

00:11:25.556 --> 00:11:26.430
And your website is--

00:11:26.430 --> 00:11:28.705
BILLY RUTLEDGE: Yeah,
AIYprojects.withGoogle.com.

00:11:28.705 --> 00:11:31.330
LAURENCE MORONEY: And we've put
a link to it in the description

00:11:31.330 --> 00:11:31.830
down here.

00:11:31.830 --> 00:11:33.134
BILLY RUTLEDGE: OK.

00:11:33.134 --> 00:11:35.050
LAURENCE MORONEY: Now,
in order to work, like,

00:11:35.050 --> 00:11:37.200
does all this need to be
connected to the cloud?

00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:40.440
BILLY RUTLEDGE: Well the default
use case is cloud connected.

00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:43.950
And we demonstrate how to
use the Google Assistant

00:11:43.950 --> 00:11:46.530
STK for that-- you know, how
to interact with Google, Google

00:11:46.530 --> 00:11:48.820
Home kind of functionality.

00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:51.930
And then also, we show you how
to connect to the Google Cloud

00:11:51.930 --> 00:11:54.870
Speech API, which is a
more sophisticated voice

00:11:54.870 --> 00:11:57.570
recognition, natural
language processing library,

00:11:57.570 --> 00:12:01.770
80 different languages, hands on
jargon, and that sort of thing.

00:12:01.770 --> 00:12:02.730
But no.

00:12:02.730 --> 00:12:06.000
We also include-- or
will soon include--

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.240
the way to do it on device,
using a TensorFlow model that

00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:11.550
can run on the Raspberry Pi.

00:12:11.550 --> 00:12:13.360
So you can do the
cloud connected case,

00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:14.615
as well as the offline case.

00:12:14.615 --> 00:12:15.490
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK.

00:12:15.490 --> 00:12:17.550
So even like, a small,
inexpensive computer

00:12:17.550 --> 00:12:20.370
like Raspberry Pi, we've got
TensorFlow speech recognition?

00:12:20.370 --> 00:12:20.790
BILLY RUTLEDGE: That's right.

00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:21.770
Well, we'll have it soon.

00:12:21.770 --> 00:12:23.394
We're just a few
weeks away from making

00:12:23.394 --> 00:12:25.710
that available as a
release on the website.

00:12:25.710 --> 00:12:26.520
LAURENCE MORONEY:
That's exciting.

00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:26.970
BILLY RUTLEDGE: So yes.

00:12:26.970 --> 00:12:29.070
We intended to include
it with the launch.

00:12:29.070 --> 00:12:32.160
But we were a little
bit slow gathering

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:35.400
the training data needed
to craft that model

00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:36.720
and make it available.

00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:38.190
LAURENCE MORONEY: I saw
there was like a link.

00:12:38.190 --> 00:12:38.510
Went out a couple
weeks ago, right?

00:12:38.510 --> 00:12:39.120
BILLY RUTLEDGE: Yeah, yeah.

00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:39.661
That's right.

00:12:39.661 --> 00:12:41.940
So, there's a link
on the website,

00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:44.126
AIYprojects.with
Google.com/voice.

00:12:44.126 --> 00:12:45.000
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.290
BILLY RUTLEDGE: And if you
can look on the left nav,

00:12:47.290 --> 00:12:49.230
under the maker's
guide, there is a link

00:12:49.230 --> 00:12:53.040
to understand how
to do it on device.

00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:55.080
Which, right now, there's
just a simple step

00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:59.030
to submit your speech
so we can capture

00:12:59.030 --> 00:13:00.720
people saying the
words that we want

00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:02.150
to put into the vocabulary.

00:13:02.150 --> 00:13:04.770
And I think, for now, we're
looking at simple transport

00:13:04.770 --> 00:13:08.740
type of controls, words like,
stop, go, left, right, up,

00:13:08.740 --> 00:13:09.240
down.

00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:10.950
Things that you might
tell a device to

00:13:10.950 --> 00:13:13.560
do to command to
take some action.

00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:17.520
And once we have enough data
coming through that channel,

00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:19.010
we'll begin training the model.

00:13:19.010 --> 00:13:21.300
And then release,
not only the model,

00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:25.590
so that you can run it inside
of the kit offline, but also,

00:13:25.590 --> 00:13:26.730
release the training data.

00:13:26.730 --> 00:13:30.030
So, you know, the spirit
of AIY is very open,

00:13:30.030 --> 00:13:33.510
open source, freely
available, low cost,

00:13:33.510 --> 00:13:35.850
when you have to
include the accessories.

00:13:35.850 --> 00:13:38.516
And so we want to make sure that
the data that we're gathering

00:13:38.516 --> 00:13:40.140
through the website
to train the models

00:13:40.140 --> 00:13:42.300
is also freely
available for everyone

00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:44.430
to take, and maybe
create their own models,

00:13:44.430 --> 00:13:46.000
if that's what interests you.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:46.590
LAURENCE MORONEY:
So the more people

00:13:46.590 --> 00:13:48.090
that do that, to train it, the
better the models' going to be.

00:13:48.090 --> 00:13:48.750
BILLY RUTLEDGE:
The better it gets.

00:13:48.750 --> 00:13:49.250
Yeah.

00:13:49.250 --> 00:13:51.660
The higher accuracy,
the better response.

00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:53.070
LAURENCE MORONEY: Because I
responded to that when it first

00:13:53.070 --> 00:13:53.650
came out.

00:13:53.650 --> 00:13:54.760
And I sent my voice in.

00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:57.060
And I just hope lots
of other people do it.

00:13:57.060 --> 00:13:58.740
Or this is only going to be
able to recognize Irish accents.

00:13:58.740 --> 00:14:00.300
BILLY RUTLEDGE: I did as well.

00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:01.710
That's funny.

00:14:01.710 --> 00:14:02.367
I did as well.

00:14:02.367 --> 00:14:04.450
And I've just been looking
at them coming through.

00:14:04.450 --> 00:14:06.100
And we're having
quite a good response.

00:14:06.100 --> 00:14:08.260
So thanks for everyone
that's done that.

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:09.510
And let's keep them coming in.

00:14:09.510 --> 00:14:10.040
LAURENCE MORONEY:
Keep them coming.

00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:12.570
And we'll put the link in the
description below this video,

00:14:12.570 --> 00:14:13.320
right down here.

00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:13.830
BILLY RUTLEDGE: Perfect.

00:14:13.830 --> 00:14:14.220
Great.

00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:15.390
LAURENCE MORONEY:
So, given that this

00:14:15.390 --> 00:14:17.040
has been so popular,
where do you think you're

00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:18.150
going to go next with it?

00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:20.275
BILLY RUTLEDGE: Well, I
think the general direction

00:14:20.275 --> 00:14:23.160
that we're going next
is to bring more--

00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:27.390
more ways for people
to create interfaces

00:14:27.390 --> 00:14:29.460
for computers that are natural.

00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:32.997
So, if this is using your voice
to communicate with a computer,

00:14:32.997 --> 00:14:34.830
what are the other ways
that human naturally

00:14:34.830 --> 00:14:36.210
communicate between themselves?

00:14:36.210 --> 00:14:39.540
Like you and I are interacting
through voice or ears or eyes

00:14:39.540 --> 00:14:40.720
and hand gestures.

00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:43.920
So, looking at a way to
bring those technologies

00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:46.830
into low cost, affordable
kits for people to explore.

00:14:46.830 --> 00:14:49.581
Maybe mix and match and build
more interesting things with--

00:14:49.581 --> 00:14:51.330
this is kind of the
direction that we hope

00:14:51.330 --> 00:14:52.770
to go this year and next year.

00:14:52.770 --> 00:14:53.700
LAURENCE MORONEY:
And me personally,

00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:55.170
I've been like,
tinkering with the maker

00:14:55.170 --> 00:14:56.211
space for a little while.

00:14:56.211 --> 00:14:59.207
But having something
that easily expands

00:14:59.207 --> 00:15:01.290
the boundaries of what I
can do in the maker space

00:15:01.290 --> 00:15:02.234
is just mind blowing.

00:15:02.234 --> 00:15:03.900
So I can't wait to
see what you do next.

00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:05.040
BILLY RUTLEDGE: Fantastic.

00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:07.590
We'll make sure that
you get the kits.

00:15:07.590 --> 00:15:09.510
LAURENCE MORONEY:
I'm taking this one.

00:15:09.510 --> 00:15:10.720
So thank you so much, Billy.

00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:11.680
This has been a real pleasure.

00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:13.554
And it's so much fun to
play with this thing.

00:15:13.554 --> 00:15:16.320
And I'm hoping many, many,
many, many, many more people

00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:18.870
in the future will be getting
hands on and building stuff

00:15:18.870 --> 00:15:19.140
and building really
interesting things with it.

00:15:19.140 --> 00:15:20.098
BILLY RUTLEDGE: Me too.

00:15:20.098 --> 00:15:20.610
Yeah.

00:15:20.610 --> 00:15:22.297
More makers, more kits.

00:15:22.297 --> 00:15:23.880
We want to see what
people do with it.

00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:26.199
LAURENCE MORONEY: Just
keep making awesome stuff.

00:15:26.199 --> 00:15:27.240
BILLY RUTLEDGE: For sure.

00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:28.140
LAURENCE MORONEY:
So, if you want

00:15:28.140 --> 00:15:30.140
to learn how to build one
of these for yourself,

00:15:30.140 --> 00:15:33.590
if you want to order the kit,
AIYprojects.withGoogle.com,

00:15:33.590 --> 00:15:35.220
it's packed with resources.

00:15:35.220 --> 00:15:38.530
There's instructions on how to
build it yourself, of course.

00:15:38.530 --> 00:15:41.040
Open source code so that
you can extend the models

00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:42.127
in this or there.

00:15:42.127 --> 00:15:44.460
The voice models that Billy
mentioned are also in there.

00:15:44.460 --> 00:15:46.382
We've put the link in
the description below.

00:15:46.382 --> 00:15:47.340
Please go check it out.

00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:48.881
I can't wait to see
what you'll make.

00:15:48.881 --> 00:15:50.747
Thank you. and
thanks again, Billy.

00:15:50.747 --> 00:15:51.830
BILLY RUTLEDGE: Thank you.

00:15:51.830 --> 00:15:56.380
