STEPHEN CARPENTER:
I want to show you

00:00:02.231 --> 00:00:05.260
a picture, an image that
I created collaboratively

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:06.920
this morning.

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:10.560
So as you see, this was
tagged Danbury, Connecticut.

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:13.140
So that's just down the road.

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:16.000
And since I posted it this
morning, six hours ago,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.766
18 people have liked it.

00:00:17.766 --> 00:00:19.640
They haven't told me
what they like about it,

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:21.100
but they've liked it.

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:24.650
And I added some context there.

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:28.750
My name, or my handle is
there-- @bscarpenterii--

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:32.500
"Double Water Fountains,"
Danbury, Connecticut, 2017.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:33.940
Then there's some hashtags--

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.540
#doubletaking, #troublemaking.

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:41.230
And then I've tagged
some other folks

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:45.490
who I follow or follow me, who
I thought might be interested.

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:48.760
All three of them happen
to be connected to MIT.

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:54.370
So this image is, in many
ways, just a black and white

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:59.500
Instagram photograph that I
also posted to my Tumblr account

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.730
and I posted to my
Twitter account.

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:03.700
This is a practice
people do quite often.

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:11.230
But this is a photograph
that originated and continues

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:16.330
to exist within a conversation
for me, with an existing

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:19.210
photograph, specifically,
other similar photographs,

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:22.192
as well as it sits
within a conversation

00:01:22.192 --> 00:01:23.650
with other people--
as you can see,

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:25.930
at least 18 people who
like it but haven't

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:28.630
commented on why they like it.

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.080
This photograph was originally
taken as a color photograph,

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.080
using this phone.

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.905
I set the setting from portrait
and landscape to square,

00:01:38.905 --> 00:01:40.030
because we can do that now.

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:41.530
We have these options.

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:45.010
And then once the
photograph was taken,

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:47.530
I put it through a series
of filters in Instagram

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:51.040
to turn it into this black
and white photograph.

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.760
Now, as you can probably
notice, I most likely

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:58.280
didn't shoot this on my own,
unless I had a tripod and then

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.190
a timer that I set.

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:03.400
So one might assume that
someone else actually

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:04.340
took the photograph.

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:05.500
And that's what happened.

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.780
This is the most recent
photograph in a series--

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:12.430
I believe I'm at or beyond
100 of these in the past three

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:14.020
or four years--

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:17.260
in which, if I'm
in a public space

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:21.000
and I see a double
water fountain

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.699
and there's someone nearby,
I'll ask them-- excuse me.

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:25.740
Would you give me a hand?

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.000
I'm an artist.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.150
And I take photographs of
double water fountains.

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.400
Would you mind taking
a picture of me?

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.042
I'm going to drink
out of the fountain.

00:02:35.042 --> 00:02:36.750
And I'd like you to
take a picture of me.

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.480
Make sure both fountains and
my body are in the photograph,

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:40.345
please.

00:02:40.345 --> 00:02:41.970
That's all the
instruction I give them.

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.610
There's no composition 101.

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:48.592
There's no depth
of field lesson.

00:02:48.592 --> 00:02:49.800
And then they take a picture.

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.100
And I drink the water
during the entire time

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.690
they're setting up and moving
their body and in and out.

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:58.680
And sometimes it takes
a couple of seconds.

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.430
Sometimes it takes what
feels like four or five days.

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.550
You know, you've had
this experience, right?

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:06.300
And then what happens
when you ask someone

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:09.932
to take a photo of you using
your camera or your phone?

00:03:09.932 --> 00:03:11.640
They turn around and
they show it to you.

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.190
We can do that with
digital photographs now.

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:15.821
How is that?

00:03:15.821 --> 00:03:17.070
And I look at it, and say, oh.

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:19.330
Oh, that's quite nice.

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:22.020
And then if they have time, if
they're not rushing off-- oh,

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:23.940
I have to run--

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:27.550
well, would you mind looking
at another photograph?

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:29.100
And most of the
time they say, yeah.

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.140
I'll look at the
other photograph.

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:33.510
And it's that other
photograph that I show them

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:37.890
that inspired me to start
taking these photographs.

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:41.260
So the other photograph
I show them is this one.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.890
This is also a black
and white photograph.

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:47.022
It was not taken
with a digital phone.

00:03:47.022 --> 00:03:48.480
It was actually
taken with a camera

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:52.910
that uses this interesting
technology called film.

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:55.470
A lot of people who
use these machines

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:57.060
don't actually
know what film is.

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:03.900
And this photograph was taken
in 1950 by Elliot Erwitt.

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:08.340
It was taken in South Carolina.

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:13.530
And this photograph
shows a gentleman

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:18.630
wearing a hat, drinking out
of one of two water fountains.

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:22.710
The water fountains
each have labels.

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:27.420
And they, although, are situated
as double water fountains,

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:30.870
or side-by-side fountains,
they are, essentially,

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:34.020
constructed for different
audiences and different users.

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:36.360
And we might know that
because of the labels

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.262
that are above them.

00:04:38.262 --> 00:04:39.970
This photograph, double
water fountains--

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:42.261
or, it's actually called
"Segregated Water Fountains"--

00:04:42.261 --> 00:04:47.160
is one of a few that
Erwitt took in the '50s.

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:50.520
He used to take--

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:53.070
he was known as a
street photographer

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:58.890
at that time, when he was taking
photographs, and capturing just

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:04.290
some basic, typical scenes that
would happen in daily life.

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:07.050
So it's this photograph that
I had probably seen, or one

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:09.370
of them similar to it,
years and years ago.

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:11.812
I don't remember the
first time I saw it.

00:05:11.812 --> 00:05:14.020
And you know how images come
in and out of your life,

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:15.820
or people come in and out,
or stories come in and out?

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:17.236
Well, this one did
the same thing.

00:05:17.236 --> 00:05:20.290
But about 10 years
ago, 15 years ago,

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:24.870
maybe, when I started wearing
hats like this, in part because

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:27.120
I just thought they
looked pretty interesting

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:30.210
and they reminded me of
my grandfather, whose

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:33.460
first name is also my
father's first name--

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:40.840
it's also my first name, so
there's that connection there.

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:43.740
And as I looked
at this photograph

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:46.650
shortly after I started
wearing these hats,

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:49.074
I started to see these
photographs differently,

00:05:49.074 --> 00:05:51.240
because as I looked more
closely at that photograph,

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:54.040
I started to see myself
in that photograph,

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:58.720
and wonder whether years
before I was even born--

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:02.790
I was born 15 years after
this photograph was taken.

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:05.100
But certainly, signs
like this and practices

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:11.120
that these signs encourage were
still in place when I was born.

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:17.210
But as I continued to look
at this photograph and others

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:19.670
like it, I would see
myself in it differently.

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:22.100
And I would wonder, would I--

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:23.270
what would I have felt like?

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:24.228
What would I have done?

00:06:24.228 --> 00:06:28.380
What would it have been like
for me to be in that situation?

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:31.400
So I started to take--

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:34.570
in public places, it's not
uncommon to see double water

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:35.960
fountains.

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:38.930
In public places, it's not
uncommon to see other people.

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:40.550
In public places,
it's not uncommon

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:43.310
for me to have my phone,
which takes pictures.

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:47.060
So that combination
of components

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:50.990
inspired me, or has been the
motivating piece, and also

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:53.810
the materiality of
this series of works.

00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:58.580
This is on a beach
in California.

00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:00.140
I don't recall
where this one is.

00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:01.109
Instagram remembers.

00:07:01.109 --> 00:07:02.150
I don't have to remember.

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:09.650
This is in the State House in
South Carolina, three or four

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:11.540
months before the
Confederate flag

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:15.680
that was flying about 100
yards away from this spot

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:17.840
where you see me, three
or four months before it

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:20.660
was taken down a few years ago.

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:30.370
So my daughter, who is
now eight, but at the time

00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:35.470
that this photograph was taken,
she was about three or four--

00:07:35.470 --> 00:07:39.460
and because I think
I'm a pretty good dad,

00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:41.890
I take her with me
to various places.

00:07:41.890 --> 00:07:45.040
And public places have
double water fountains.

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:47.710
And she would
watch me ask people

00:07:47.710 --> 00:07:52.540
to take my picture in front of
double water fountains, which

00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:55.846
was all well and good,
because that's what papa does.

00:07:55.846 --> 00:07:56.470
He's an artist.

00:07:56.470 --> 00:07:59.820
And he does things
and takes images.

00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:07.310
But one day, she asked me,
Papa, would you take my picture?

00:08:07.310 --> 00:08:08.180
I said, sure.

00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:09.470
I would be happy to.

00:08:09.470 --> 00:08:11.136
But you have to take my picture.

00:08:11.136 --> 00:08:13.932
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:18.320
And so we gain
perspectives on the world

00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:20.390
through the eyes
of other people,

00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:23.230
seeing what we see
through what they see.

00:08:23.230 --> 00:08:28.430
But more than that being
an interesting photograph

00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:32.459
of this three-year-old angle,
a few feet off the ground,

00:08:32.459 --> 00:08:36.919
it was also a moment where I
realized that the next question

00:08:36.919 --> 00:08:39.230
for her after, would
you take my picture,

00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:43.280
was, Papa, why are you
taking these pictures?

00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:45.410
So then I had to
have conversations

00:08:45.410 --> 00:08:47.810
about the history
of this country,

00:08:47.810 --> 00:08:53.240
and a particular story, an
ongoing story, an uncomfortably

00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:57.200
challenging story in the
history of this country, a story

00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:58.820
that we're still writing today.

00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:03.170
I had to talk to my
daughter about race.

00:09:03.170 --> 00:09:06.140
And so this project, the "Double
Water Fountains" project,

00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:08.480
you can find on Tumblr.

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:10.680
Just look for @bscarpenterii,
and there it is.

00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:13.790
I post these images quite often.

00:09:13.790 --> 00:09:19.310
So I'm saying all this to
say, these photographs come

00:09:19.310 --> 00:09:24.050
from my interest in
and my relationship

00:09:24.050 --> 00:09:28.780
with the double water
fountain photograph,

00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:31.880
or the segregated
photograph, by Elliot Erwitt.

00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:34.040
This historical
photograph, for me,

00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:38.720
sits in a conversation with
many other photographs like it,

00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:43.490
but also within the
practices, the policies,

00:09:43.490 --> 00:09:49.750
the cultural understandings that
allowed for segregated water

00:09:49.750 --> 00:09:52.499
fountains and
segregation to exist.

00:09:52.499 --> 00:09:54.290
LARRY SUSSKIND: If you
walk down the street

00:09:54.290 --> 00:09:57.080
of Baltimore or Philadelphia--

00:09:57.080 --> 00:10:01.580
and there's plenty of
confrontation this last year

00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:04.400
in Philadelphia that a
lot of people would feel

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:06.920
is racially rooted.

00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:09.950
And if you say, oh, we
should have more constructive

00:10:09.950 --> 00:10:11.870
conversations between people.

00:10:11.870 --> 00:10:15.710
They should learn how
to deal with conflict

00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:21.470
that's in some way connected to
or racially defined or rooted.

00:10:21.470 --> 00:10:24.080
And well, people don't
know how to do that.

00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:26.090
They don't know how
to do that, to--

00:10:26.090 --> 00:10:26.591
cross race.

00:10:26.591 --> 00:10:27.590
STEPHEN CARPENTER: Sure.

00:10:27.590 --> 00:10:29.270
LARRY SUSSKIND: And
so you think it's

00:10:29.270 --> 00:10:32.270
the picture that makes
the conversation possible?

00:10:32.270 --> 00:10:34.570
It's a pretty harmless picture.

00:10:34.570 --> 00:10:37.340
It's not an
inflammatory picture.

00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:38.420
STEPHEN CARPENTER: No.

00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:44.270
So the conversation begins well
before the photograph is taken.

00:10:44.270 --> 00:10:49.310
The conversation begins well
before the Erwitt photograph

00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:50.660
is presented.

00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:53.570
The conversation begins
well before the conversation

00:10:53.570 --> 00:10:56.630
about race or history or
wherever the direction is.

00:10:56.630 --> 00:10:58.666
Right?

00:10:58.666 --> 00:11:00.290
So your question
about, well, how do we

00:11:00.290 --> 00:11:01.790
engage in these
conversations-- how

00:11:01.790 --> 00:11:03.800
do we engage in
these conversations?

00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:06.360
We start the conversations.

00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:07.190
I don't know that--

00:11:07.190 --> 00:11:12.694
I take it-- I'm concerned
that when I hear statements

00:11:12.694 --> 00:11:14.360
or there's an assumption
that, oh, well,

00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:17.150
it's a difficult conversation,
we can't talk about it,

00:11:17.150 --> 00:11:18.780
I don't think that's
the case at all.

00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:19.280
We can.

00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:20.510
I think it's the starting.

00:11:20.510 --> 00:11:22.760
And this is, I think, central
to part of your question

00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:25.040
is, how do we start
those conversations?

00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:26.270
I think we need to start it.

00:11:26.270 --> 00:11:28.130
The mediator, which
is also what I

00:11:28.130 --> 00:11:30.410
heard in what you
were saying, might be

00:11:30.410 --> 00:11:31.730
the camera and the photograph.

00:11:31.730 --> 00:11:34.790
It might not be
another individual.

00:11:34.790 --> 00:11:38.510
The third thing I
would say is, and I

00:11:38.510 --> 00:11:45.740
hope this came through with
my description and my earlier

00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:49.280
responses, I'm not trying
to persuade anyone.

00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:50.900
I'm not trying to make a case.

00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:56.690
Or, in your example, where maybe
sensing someone's defensive,

00:11:56.690 --> 00:12:05.870
I'm not trying to nail them to
the wall or prove them wrong,

00:12:05.870 --> 00:12:10.610
but bring up other
examples that allow us

00:12:10.610 --> 00:12:12.950
to continue the conversation.

00:12:12.950 --> 00:12:16.261
It's about opening it
up rather than saying--

00:12:16.261 --> 00:12:18.260
so for example, if someone
said, oh, well, we're

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:20.300
way past that, I'd
say, no, you're wrong.

00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:22.830
Here's-- I wouldn't-- it's
not about, no, you're wrong.

00:12:22.830 --> 00:12:25.070
It's, oh, well, what about this?

00:12:25.070 --> 00:12:27.060
Or tell me about such and such.

00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:33.620
So instead of being persuasive
to the point of arguing a point

00:12:33.620 --> 00:12:37.910
to convert someone from one
perspective to the other,

00:12:37.910 --> 00:12:42.450
while that might be,
at some level, a goal

00:12:42.450 --> 00:12:44.300
for some folks
engaged in this work,

00:12:44.300 --> 00:12:47.491
I think before one gets
there, becoming comfortable,

00:12:47.491 --> 00:12:49.490
setting a comfortable
space for the conversation

00:12:49.490 --> 00:12:50.200
needs to happen.

00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:51.408
So it's not about persuasion.

00:12:51.408 --> 00:12:54.200
It's about, let's open
up that space and talk

00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:56.330
about the difficulties
within, and the complexities

00:12:56.330 --> 00:12:58.020
in that conversation.

00:12:58.020 --> 00:13:03.890
LARRY SUSSKIND: So for me,
there's something unusual

00:13:03.890 --> 00:13:08.120
that I think is attributable
to the photograph, to the fact

00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:10.580
that the photograph's
at the heart

00:13:10.580 --> 00:13:12.950
of a conversation about race.

00:13:12.950 --> 00:13:15.320
And there's both
an old photograph

00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:17.810
and a new photograph.

00:13:17.810 --> 00:13:22.430
And in some other realms,
particularly in the realm

00:13:22.430 --> 00:13:25.967
of science, there
are difficulties

00:13:25.967 --> 00:13:27.800
of people from different
disciplines talking

00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:29.180
to each other.

00:13:29.180 --> 00:13:35.000
And one theory about how to
overcome those difficulties

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:40.160
is to use something known
as a boundary object.

00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:44.880
So it's not me and you and
our different disciplines.

00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:47.640
It's, oh, here's a map.

00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:49.871
And how do you read that map?

00:13:49.871 --> 00:13:50.370
Oh, no.

00:13:50.370 --> 00:13:51.760
I read that map differently.

00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:53.093
What do you think that map said?

00:13:53.093 --> 00:13:56.460
Oh, I think-- and I don't
have to talk directly

00:13:56.460 --> 00:13:59.280
to a person from a
different discipline.

00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:05.310
We can both be talking about
or through the boundary object.

00:14:05.310 --> 00:14:07.680
And my question, and
the question in my mind

00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:11.790
was, does a photograph,
in particular,

00:14:11.790 --> 00:14:15.050
and a black and white
one, in particular,

00:14:15.050 --> 00:14:19.860
an old versus a new
one, provide a means

00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:23.820
to address, in this
case, a potentially

00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:25.320
difficult conversation?

00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:28.590
Now, I think who the
people are matters.

00:14:28.590 --> 00:14:31.980
And I think your
non-defensive style

00:14:31.980 --> 00:14:34.860
and your willingness to track
the conversation wherever

00:14:34.860 --> 00:14:38.700
it goes probably has more
to do than anything else

00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:42.210
with how the conversations
you have turn out.

00:14:42.210 --> 00:14:48.360
But I'm trying to see if we
might deduce from your project

00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:53.430
some kinds of insights
about the use of photographs

00:14:53.430 --> 00:14:56.100
in particular, but
not only, to make

00:14:56.100 --> 00:14:58.020
difficult conversations easier.

00:14:58.020 --> 00:15:03.210
That's where I'm going
with my questions.

00:15:03.210 --> 00:15:07.140
STEPHEN CARPENTER: So your
example of boundary object

00:15:07.140 --> 00:15:08.737
is interesting,
because it makes me

00:15:08.737 --> 00:15:10.320
think of a couple
of different things.

00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:13.650
One, when talking
about works of art

00:15:13.650 --> 00:15:18.570
in schools, or
even in galleries,

00:15:18.570 --> 00:15:20.670
for a number of reasons
that we don't necessarily

00:15:20.670 --> 00:15:23.580
need to get into at
this point, many folks

00:15:23.580 --> 00:15:29.160
are interested in the formal
qualities of those works.

00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:32.670
And those formal qualities are
fine-- formal meaning shape

00:15:32.670 --> 00:15:35.940
and color and texture.

00:15:35.940 --> 00:15:37.980
But as we start
to look and think

00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:41.947
about those works
of art contextually,

00:15:41.947 --> 00:15:43.530
place them into an
historical context,

00:15:43.530 --> 00:15:46.530
a social, political
context, those works

00:15:46.530 --> 00:15:49.860
are about those other
realms as much as they

00:15:49.860 --> 00:15:51.870
are about the physicality,
moving it away

00:15:51.870 --> 00:15:55.080
from the material, the physical
material into other kinds of--

00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:58.830
what might move into new
materialisms in some way.

00:15:58.830 --> 00:16:02.040
So I think there's a
bit of that going on,

00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:05.061
where your example of the map,
it's not about the physical map

00:16:05.061 --> 00:16:05.560
itself.

00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:09.580
It's about the representation
and the signifying aspects.

00:16:09.580 --> 00:16:13.690
Now, these photographs, the
black and white component,

00:16:13.690 --> 00:16:17.760
the formal aspect,
moves it away from--

00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:20.880
and this was intentional for
me, because the original dozen

00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:24.030
or so that I took were in color.

00:16:24.030 --> 00:16:25.860
And there was some
distance for me

00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:30.480
between those color images
and the Erwitt photograph.

00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:34.361
And it wasn't until I tinkered
with the first one in Instagram

00:16:34.361 --> 00:16:36.360
and made it black and
white-- and I resisted it,

00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:38.151
because I didn't want
it to be too literal.

00:16:38.151 --> 00:16:39.865
You know?

00:16:39.865 --> 00:16:42.540
There was a shift that happened.

00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:47.730
The time element flattened.

00:16:47.730 --> 00:16:50.790
And so putting oneself in--
there's something about a black

00:16:50.790 --> 00:16:54.600
and white photograph that
it moves it away from

00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:56.250
a contemporary sense of--

00:16:56.250 --> 00:16:58.500
because the color gets removed.

00:16:58.500 --> 00:17:01.720
Now, the other piece there is--

00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:04.200
so you know, you want to have
an interview with someone.

00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:06.780
So you say, OK, bring an object
that means something to you.

00:17:06.780 --> 00:17:09.119
Or we'll talk about this map.

00:17:09.119 --> 00:17:11.859
This photograph, we
produced together.

00:17:11.859 --> 00:17:14.150
As a matter of fact, the
person I'm talking to,

00:17:14.150 --> 00:17:16.319
they're the ones who
produced it, primarily.

00:17:16.319 --> 00:17:17.890
They composed and took the shot.

00:17:17.890 --> 00:17:19.990
So they have a degree of
ownership and connection

00:17:19.990 --> 00:17:20.490
with it.

00:17:20.490 --> 00:17:22.960
LARRY SUSSKIND: That's
very interesting.

00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:27.000
That's a very interesting
way of reframing

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.870
why it might be
easier for them to use

00:17:30.870 --> 00:17:34.202
the photo as a basis
for the conversation,

00:17:34.202 --> 00:17:36.660
because they have part of the
ownership of having taken it.

00:17:36.660 --> 00:17:38.160
STEPHEN CARPENTER:
Not only are they

00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:40.341
part of the ownership
of having taken it,

00:17:40.341 --> 00:17:42.090
but if you look closely
at the photograph,

00:17:42.090 --> 00:17:44.740
you don't see them
in the photograph.

00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:46.120
I'm in the photograph.

00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:50.940
So anything they say about
it is separated from them.

00:17:50.940 --> 00:17:54.510
But it gets difficult,
too, because the person

00:17:54.510 --> 00:17:57.730
in the photograph is the
person standing next to them.

00:17:57.730 --> 00:17:59.970
So while the photograph
allows for some separation

00:17:59.970 --> 00:18:04.560
and objectification of that
individual, the very subject

00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:06.150
at hand is right there.

00:18:06.150 --> 00:18:07.440
So there's a complexity there.

00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:12.930
But their contribution
to the creation

00:18:12.930 --> 00:18:14.670
of that work and that
ownership, I think,

00:18:14.670 --> 00:18:19.145
is key to this conversation.

00:18:19.145 --> 00:18:20.520
LARRY SUSSKIND:
I've been trying,

00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:24.100
since the first time I saw
this, to imagine if there

00:18:24.100 --> 00:18:30.600
is a method in here to make it
easier for conversations that

00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:32.820
have race at their root.

00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:39.420
But I particularly mean
conversations about situations

00:18:39.420 --> 00:18:42.440
where race is at
their root, and they

00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:44.820
are about people
being unable to deal

00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:49.080
with differences in any other
way except through violence.

00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:52.740
And so I want to
make them harder,

00:18:52.740 --> 00:18:54.700
more difficult conversations.

00:18:54.700 --> 00:18:57.330
But I'm trying to imagine--
and hopefully, we can actually,

00:18:57.330 --> 00:18:59.100
at some point, do this--

00:18:59.100 --> 00:19:07.830
whether the same smoothing or
easing effect of the exercise

00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:10.560
makes it possible to
have a conversation,

00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:12.270
which, otherwise,
you couldn't have.

00:19:12.270 --> 00:19:13.270
STEPHEN CARPENTER: Yeah.

00:19:13.270 --> 00:19:14.990
I think so.

00:19:14.990 --> 00:19:19.890
A statement that
I'll use tomorrow

00:19:19.890 --> 00:19:22.680
in the lecture and workshop,
but I'll use it right now.

00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:25.530
I was in-- it was
about three years ago.

00:19:25.530 --> 00:19:27.760
I was teaching an
undergraduate class

00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:31.650
of students who were
preparing to be art teachers.

00:19:31.650 --> 00:19:33.900
And we were talking about,
I said, what is this art?

00:19:33.900 --> 00:19:34.761
What does art do?

00:19:34.761 --> 00:19:35.760
Why are we studying art?

00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:37.385
Why do you want to
be a teacher of art?

00:19:37.385 --> 00:19:39.750
What is art's role in our lives?

00:19:39.750 --> 00:19:42.190
You know, these really small,
insignificant questions.

00:19:42.190 --> 00:19:44.070
No, it's a big,
important question.

00:19:44.070 --> 00:19:47.550
And one of the students
said, you know,

00:19:47.550 --> 00:19:50.430
art allows us to--
among the things

00:19:50.430 --> 00:19:53.190
that it does-- but it allows us
to tell stories that we might

00:19:53.190 --> 00:19:56.040
not be able to tell
otherwise, and we probably

00:19:56.040 --> 00:19:59.400
can't tell otherwise.

00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:01.140
And I thought, oh, yeah.

00:20:01.140 --> 00:20:01.890
That makes sense.

00:20:01.890 --> 00:20:03.806
LARRY SUSSKIND: It's
consistent with the theme

00:20:03.806 --> 00:20:06.570
that I'm pursuing.

00:20:06.570 --> 00:20:10.230
I mean, people are
terrible, if just

00:20:10.230 --> 00:20:14.610
caught off-guard and with
no special training, trying

00:20:14.610 --> 00:20:20.720
to deal with issues that
have race or ethnicity,

00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:24.840
and many cases, gender, at
the heart of the difference

00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:26.490
or the conflict.

00:20:26.490 --> 00:20:29.670
And I'm just trying to think
of this notion of flattening

00:20:29.670 --> 00:20:36.480
and overcoming history by
having the two black and whites

00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:40.830
next to each other
in the same location.

00:20:40.830 --> 00:20:45.030
And now, not everybody is
as charming as you are.

00:20:45.030 --> 00:20:48.480
And so they would not
get the same response.

00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:52.590
But maybe the
existence, and the fact

00:20:52.590 --> 00:20:55.122
that they took the
new picture, which

00:20:55.122 --> 00:20:57.330
I hadn't thought of until
you said it this afternoon,

00:20:57.330 --> 00:20:59.220
is, you know, they
own some of this.

00:20:59.220 --> 00:21:00.990
So now maybe it's
easier for them

00:21:00.990 --> 00:21:05.160
to stay with the conversation.

00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:09.240
Maybe adding an artist makes--

00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:12.900
and doing these things--
makes it easier.

00:21:12.900 --> 00:21:16.661
Also, you start out by
saying, I'm an artist

00:21:16.661 --> 00:21:17.910
and I'm taking these pictures.

00:21:17.910 --> 00:21:18.330
STEPHEN CARPENTER: That's right.

00:21:18.330 --> 00:21:19.746
LARRY SUSSKIND:
You don't say, I'm

00:21:19.746 --> 00:21:22.020
someone waiting on the
street corner to ambush you,

00:21:22.020 --> 00:21:24.860
because I don't know
if I can trust you,

00:21:24.860 --> 00:21:26.789
and you probably don't
think you can trust me.

00:21:26.789 --> 00:21:27.330
None of that.

00:21:27.330 --> 00:21:28.700
It's just, I'm an artist.

00:21:28.700 --> 00:21:31.720
Will you take a picture
of me doing this?

00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:35.970
And that's very disarming, in
every sense of that phrase.

00:21:35.970 --> 00:21:41.790
And then maybe that's
the key to moving

00:21:41.790 --> 00:21:46.620
toward a conversation
where nobody's anxieties

00:21:46.620 --> 00:21:52.080
and prejudices go sky high
right at the beginning.

00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:54.420
Now, I don't know how
long it would last,

00:21:54.420 --> 00:21:56.010
once you tell them
what that side is,

00:21:56.010 --> 00:21:58.302
if they didn't already know
it, in the model that I'm--

00:21:58.302 --> 00:21:59.301
STEPHEN CARPENTER: Sure.

00:21:59.301 --> 00:22:00.990
And they might
know it, especially

00:22:00.990 --> 00:22:04.110
if they live in that
neighborhood or nearby, which

00:22:04.110 --> 00:22:07.040
would then be quite
a rich conversation,

00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:10.540
in unexpected ways, I
guess, for the artist

00:22:10.540 --> 00:22:13.070
who is initiating their work.
