something that kind of had to come about
 

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:08.900
something that kind of had to come about

that within the UI yeah that's a great

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:12.780
that within the UI yeah that's a great

question

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:13.320
question
 

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:15.710
question
um so I think the short answer to that

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:15.720
um so I think the short answer to that
 

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:18.050
um so I think the short answer to that
is it there there wasn't a lot of

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:18.060
is it there there wasn't a lot of
 

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:20.450
is it there there wasn't a lot of
conscious discussion or decision around

00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:20.460
conscious discussion or decision around
 

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:23.600
conscious discussion or decision around
building a personality into the app I

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:23.610
building a personality into the app I
 

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:25.970
building a personality into the app I
think we think about it more in terms of

00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:25.980
think we think about it more in terms of
 

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:28.850
think we think about it more in terms of
what is I guess the personality of the

00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:28.860
what is I guess the personality of the
 

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:30.920
what is I guess the personality of the
main character of a story and how does

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:30.930
main character of a story and how does
 

00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:32.360
main character of a story and how does
that speak to the audience we're trying

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:32.370
that speak to the audience we're trying
 

00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:34.760
that speak to the audience we're trying
to target that story too

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:34.770
to target that story too
 

00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:36.590
to target that story too
but what I will say and I just want to

00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:36.600
but what I will say and I just want to
 

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:38.660
but what I will say and I just want to
circle back and kind of piggyback off of

00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:38.670
circle back and kind of piggyback off of
 

00:07:38.670 --> 00:07:40.160
circle back and kind of piggyback off of
the Wonder Bread analogy because I just

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:40.170
the Wonder Bread analogy because I just
 

00:07:40.170 --> 00:07:42.950
the Wonder Bread analogy because I just
think it's so good and it made me as you

00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:42.960
think it's so good and it made me as you
 

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:45.380
think it's so good and it made me as you
were saying it think about maybe we're

00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:45.390
were saying it think about maybe we're
 

00:07:45.390 --> 00:07:47.150
were saying it think about maybe we're
kind of experiencing like our Wonder

00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:47.160
kind of experiencing like our Wonder
 

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:51.650
kind of experiencing like our Wonder
Bread moment with mobile and in and what

00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:51.660
Bread moment with mobile and in and what
 

00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:53.480
Bread moment with mobile and in and what
I mean by that is you know we've sort of

00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:53.490
I mean by that is you know we've sort of
 

00:07:53.490 --> 00:07:55.250
I mean by that is you know we've sort of
had this first slew of apps that have

00:07:55.250 --> 00:07:55.260
had this first slew of apps that have
 

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:57.770
had this first slew of apps that have
come out that are really addicting and

00:07:57.770 --> 00:07:57.780
come out that are really addicting and
 

00:07:57.780 --> 00:07:59.810
come out that are really addicting and
we're using them constantly and they're

00:07:59.810 --> 00:07:59.820
we're using them constantly and they're
 

00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:01.880
we're using them constantly and they're
really entertaining but perhaps they

00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:01.890
really entertaining but perhaps they
 

00:08:01.890 --> 00:08:03.140
really entertaining but perhaps they
leave us feeling a little bit

00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:03.150
leave us feeling a little bit
 

00:08:03.150 --> 00:08:07.070
leave us feeling a little bit
dissatisfied and and kind of unhappy at

00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:07.080
dissatisfied and and kind of unhappy at
 

00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:09.800
dissatisfied and and kind of unhappy at
times you know we probably were at peak

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:09.810
times you know we probably were at peak
 

00:08:09.810 --> 00:08:11.540
times you know we probably were at peak
social we're all maybe spending a lot

00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:11.550
social we're all maybe spending a lot
 

00:08:11.550 --> 00:08:13.280
social we're all maybe spending a lot
more time on social media than we like

00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:13.290
more time on social media than we like
 

00:08:13.290 --> 00:08:15.980
more time on social media than we like
and that experience I think sometimes

00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:15.990
and that experience I think sometimes
 

00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:18.920
and that experience I think sometimes
leaves us feeling just like there's a

00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:18.930
leaves us feeling just like there's a
 

00:08:18.930 --> 00:08:21.050
leaves us feeling just like there's a
lack of something and so in many ways

00:08:21.050 --> 00:08:21.060
lack of something and so in many ways
 

00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:23.420
lack of something and so in many ways
that that is the reason why we started

00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:23.430
that that is the reason why we started
 

00:08:23.430 --> 00:08:24.220
that that is the reason why we started
hooked

00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:24.230
hooked
 

00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:28.040
hooked
we felt like we wanted to be kind of a

00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:28.050
we felt like we wanted to be kind of a
 

00:08:28.050 --> 00:08:30.770
we felt like we wanted to be kind of a
whole wheat option and you know there

00:08:30.770 --> 00:08:30.780
whole wheat option and you know there
 

00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:33.860
whole wheat option and you know there
isn't sort of a lot of there isn't a lot

00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:33.870
isn't sort of a lot of there isn't a lot
 

00:08:33.870 --> 00:08:35.480
isn't sort of a lot of there isn't a lot
of options out there that feel like a

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:35.490
of options out there that feel like a
 

00:08:35.490 --> 00:08:38.030
of options out there that feel like a
nourishing alternative to what is out

00:08:38.030 --> 00:08:38.040
nourishing alternative to what is out
 

00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:40.490
nourishing alternative to what is out
there and so yeah so I think with that

00:08:40.490 --> 00:08:40.500
there and so yeah so I think with that
 

00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:42.590
there and so yeah so I think with that
in mind you know we thought okay well

00:08:42.590 --> 00:08:42.600
in mind you know we thought okay well
 

00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:44.240
in mind you know we thought okay well
there are many studies that show that

00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:44.250
there are many studies that show that
 

00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:46.010
there are many studies that show that
there's a high correlation between the

00:08:46.010 --> 00:08:46.020
there's a high correlation between the
 

00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:47.900
there's a high correlation between the
amount of fiction a person consumes and

00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:47.910
amount of fiction a person consumes and
 

00:08:47.910 --> 00:08:50.970
amount of fiction a person consumes and
their ability to score high

00:08:50.970 --> 00:08:50.980
their ability to score high
 

00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:53.340
their ability to score high
or highly or well on tests that measure

00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:53.350
or highly or well on tests that measure
 

00:08:53.350 --> 00:08:55.260

happiness and so you take that idea in
 

00:08:58.090 --> 00:09:00.180

personal experience of reading and
 

00:09:02.470 --> 00:09:03.450
personal experience of reading and
feeling like you're sort of building

00:09:03.450 --> 00:09:03.460
feeling like you're sort of building
 

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:05.940
feeling like you're sort of building
empathy and and in this meditative state

00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:05.950
empathy and and in this meditative state
 

00:09:05.950 --> 00:09:08.970
empathy and and in this meditative state
so how do you take those facts and

00:09:08.970 --> 00:09:08.980
so how do you take those facts and
 

00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:12.300
so how do you take those facts and
experiences and translate them into an

00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:12.310
experiences and translate them into an
 

00:09:12.310 --> 00:09:14.310
experiences and translate them into an
experience for mobile basically and so

00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:14.320
experience for mobile basically and so
 

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:15.600
experience for mobile basically and so
that's kind of like where our whole

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:15.610
that's kind of like where our whole
 

00:09:15.610 --> 00:09:17.610

00:09:17.620 --> 00:09:20.100
journey started and I think you know
from our perspective too it's like you

00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:20.110
from our perspective too it's like you
 

00:09:20.110 --> 00:09:21.720
from our perspective too it's like you
can't really expect us to put down our

00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:21.730
can't really expect us to put down our
 

00:09:21.730 --> 00:09:23.190
can't really expect us to put down our
phones I don't think that we're gonna

00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:23.200
phones I don't think that we're gonna
 

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:25.440
phones I don't think that we're gonna
ever reach a point where we're gonna

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:25.450
ever reach a point where we're gonna
 

00:09:25.450 --> 00:09:29.490
ever reach a point where we're gonna
live in a digital detox and so that said

00:09:29.490 --> 00:09:29.500
live in a digital detox and so that said
 

00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:31.470
live in a digital detox and so that said
it's sort of like okay how do you how do

00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:19.480
kind of side gig and then we're gonna
test like how much of that we exposed to

00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:19.490
test like how much of that we exposed to
 

00:13:19.490 --> 00:13:21.880

engineers - we all get into kind of the
 

00:13:30.890 --> 00:13:32.140
engineers - we all get into kind of the
story and we always have to fight that

00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:32.150
story and we always have to fight that

00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:34.190
temptation to surface too much of that
 

00:13:34.190 --> 00:13:36.640
temptation to surface too much of that
and our goal is to surface sort of just

00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:36.650
and our goal is to surface sort of just
 

00:13:36.650 --> 00:13:40.240
and our goal is to surface sort of just
enough of it so that that we don't get

00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:40.250
enough of it so that that we don't get
 

00:13:40.250 --> 00:13:41.830
enough of it so that that we don't get
this pushback but we do think of

this pushback but we do think of
 

00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:43.930
this pushback but we do think of
ourselves as being sort of in a

00:13:43.930 --> 00:13:43.940
ourselves as being sort of in a
 

00:13:43.940 --> 00:13:45.760
ourselves as being sort of in a
relationship with the user and we think

00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:45.770
relationship with the user and we think
 

00:13:45.770 --> 00:13:47.080
relationship with the user and we think
that that drives a lot of our retention

00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:47.090
that that drives a lot of our retention
 

00:13:47.090 --> 00:13:49.270

but I think what's interesting about
 

00:18:08.710 --> 00:18:10.320
but I think what's interesting about
that is I've run a lot of research

another team knows it but we just

another team knows it but we just
 

00:19:07.690 --> 00:19:10.110
another team knows it but we just
decided that we had to basically if you

00:19:10.110 --> 00:19:10.120
decided that we had to basically if you

asked punch of the poncho bought a
question about the weather we had to

00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:13.390
question about the weather we had to
 

00:19:13.390 --> 00:19:15.480
question about the weather we had to
understand that 80% of the time and if

00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:15.490
understand that 80% of the time and if
 

00:19:15.490 --> 00:19:17.100
understand that 80% of the time and if
we couldn't do that then we weren't

00:19:17.100 --> 00:19:17.110
we couldn't do that then we weren't
 

00:19:17.110 --> 00:19:19.560
we couldn't do that then we weren't
succeeding and so it's kind of funny

00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:19.570
succeeding and so it's kind of funny
 

00:19:19.570 --> 00:19:21.330
succeeding and so it's kind of funny
that that we just but we as collectively

sat around we were like that's the

00:19:22.890 --> 00:19:22.900
sat around we were like that's the
 

00:19:22.900 --> 00:19:24.030
sat around we were like that's the
metric that we have to go for that's

00:19:24.030 --> 00:19:24.040
metric that we have to go for that's
 

00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:25.320
metric that we have to go for that's
such a good point too because I think

00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:25.330
such a good point too because I think
 

00:19:25.330 --> 00:19:27.150
such a good point too because I think
you guys intuitively got there and

00:19:27.150 --> 00:19:27.160
you guys intuitively got there and
 

00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:29.760
you guys intuitively got there and
that's kind of like you know head bleep

00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:29.770
that's kind of like you know head bleep
 

00:19:29.770 --> 00:19:33.120
that's kind of like you know head bleep
of this space is like if you if you

00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:33.130
of this space is like if you if you
 

00:19:33.130 --> 00:19:35.430
of this space is like if you if you
really like check-in if you if you drop

00:19:35.430 --> 00:19:35.440
really like check-in if you if you drop
 

00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:37.740
really like check-in if you if you drop
in you we all know the answers of what

00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:37.750
in you we all know the answers of what
 

00:19:37.750 --> 00:19:39.240
in you we all know the answers of what
feels good what doesn't feel good what

00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:39.250
feels good what doesn't feel good what
 

00:19:39.250 --> 00:19:41.399
feels good what doesn't feel good what
we believe what we don't what story like

00:19:41.399 --> 00:19:41.409
we believe what we don't what story like
 

00:19:41.409 --> 00:19:43.380
we believe what we don't what story like
actually like I mean literally using

00:19:43.380 --> 00:19:43.390
actually like I mean literally using
 

00:19:43.390 --> 00:19:44.050
actually like I mean literally using
your app I was

00:19:44.050 --> 00:19:44.060
your app I was
 

00:19:44.060 --> 00:19:46.030
your app I was
oh my god it's not loading fast enough

00:19:46.030 --> 00:19:46.040
oh my god it's not loading fast enough
 

00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:47.980
oh my god it's not loading fast enough
like why doesn't this story text me

00:19:47.980 --> 00:19:47.990
like why doesn't this story text me
 

00:19:47.990 --> 00:19:50.830
like why doesn't this story text me
faster and that sense of when when

00:19:50.830 --> 00:19:50.840
faster and that sense of when when
 

00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:52.780
faster and that sense of when when
you're in it versus when you're out of

00:19:52.780 --> 00:19:52.790
you're in it versus when you're out of
 

00:19:52.790 --> 00:19:54.490
you're in it versus when you're out of
it and I think it's how do we find

00:19:54.490 --> 00:19:54.500
it and I think it's how do we find
 

00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:57.280
it and I think it's how do we find
metrics that actually match that versus

00:19:57.280 --> 00:19:57.290
metrics that actually match that versus
 

00:19:57.290 --> 00:19:59.680
metrics that actually match that versus
being driven by what's the like what's

00:19:59.680 --> 00:19:59.690
being driven by what's the like what's
 

00:19:59.690 --> 00:20:01.810
being driven by what's the like what's
the actual best metric for this thing we

00:20:01.810 --> 00:20:01.820
the actual best metric for this thing we
 

00:20:01.820 --> 00:20:04.360
the actual best metric for this thing we
can kind of get lost in our heads like a

00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:04.370
can kind of get lost in our heads like a
 

00:20:04.370 --> 00:20:06.430
can kind of get lost in our heads like a
big thing I talk about is how we often

00:20:06.430 --> 00:20:06.440
big thing I talk about is how we often
 

00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:07.870
big thing I talk about is how we often
think that we're designing for people's

00:20:07.870 --> 00:20:07.880
think that we're designing for people's
 

00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:10.420
think that we're designing for people's
modes like you know airplane mode this

00:20:10.420 --> 00:20:10.430
modes like you know airplane mode this
 

00:20:10.430 --> 00:20:12.610
modes like you know airplane mode this
that what game mode stress mode

00:20:12.610 --> 00:20:12.620
that what game mode stress mode
 

00:20:12.620 --> 00:20:14.470
that what game mode stress mode
I think what's funny is people when they

00:20:14.470 --> 00:20:14.480
I think what's funny is people when they
 

00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:16.570
I think what's funny is people when they
like a research project I ran that you

00:20:16.570 --> 00:20:16.580
like a research project I ran that you
 

00:20:16.580 --> 00:20:18.700
like a research project I ran that you
know about was um I was like okay it's

00:20:18.700 --> 00:20:18.710
know about was um I was like okay it's
 

00:20:18.710 --> 00:20:19.900
know about was um I was like okay it's
really weird to ask people what their

00:20:19.900 --> 00:20:19.910
really weird to ask people what their
 

00:20:19.910 --> 00:20:21.760
really weird to ask people what their
ideal flow of information is for

00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:21.770
ideal flow of information is for
 

00:20:21.770 --> 00:20:23.050
ideal flow of information is for
notifications and this that and the

00:20:23.050 --> 00:20:23.060
notifications and this that and the
 

00:20:23.060 --> 00:20:25.510
notifications and this that and the
other and people were kind of asking me

00:20:25.510 --> 00:20:25.520
other and people were kind of asking me
 

00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:27.280
other and people were kind of asking me
about the tray and I was like okay

00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:27.290
about the tray and I was like okay
 

00:20:27.290 --> 00:20:29.560
about the tray and I was like okay
forgot the tray like I went to people

00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:29.570
forgot the tray like I went to people
 

00:20:29.570 --> 00:20:30.970
forgot the tray like I went to people
and was like you know you know what

00:20:30.970 --> 00:20:30.980
and was like you know you know what
 

00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:32.710
and was like you know you know what
airplane mode is give me like ten more

00:20:32.710 --> 00:20:32.720
airplane mode is give me like ten more
 

00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:35.650
airplane mode is give me like ten more
and all of their modes were moods they

00:20:35.650 --> 00:20:35.660
and all of their modes were moods they
 

00:20:35.660 --> 00:20:37.300
and all of their modes were moods they
weren't modes at all so just that like

00:20:37.300 --> 00:20:37.310
weren't modes at all so just that like
 

00:20:37.310 --> 00:20:39.340
weren't modes at all so just that like
little the extra Oh makes a difference I

00:20:39.340 --> 00:20:39.350
little the extra Oh makes a difference I
 

00:20:39.350 --> 00:20:41.050
little the extra Oh makes a difference I
think like intuitively being like oh I

00:20:41.050 --> 00:20:41.060
think like intuitively being like oh I
 

00:20:41.060 --> 00:20:42.640
think like intuitively being like oh I
think that's right how do I make a

00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:42.650
think that's right how do I make a
 

00:20:42.650 --> 00:20:44.940
think that's right how do I make a
metric for that yeah you talked about

00:20:44.940 --> 00:20:44.950
metric for that yeah you talked about
 

00:20:44.950 --> 00:20:47.260
metric for that yeah you talked about
kind of you know maybe mimicking a great

00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:47.270
kind of you know maybe mimicking a great
 

00:20:47.270 --> 00:20:48.760
kind of you know maybe mimicking a great
relationship or you've got kind of this

00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:48.770
relationship or you've got kind of this
 

00:20:48.770 --> 00:20:50.920
relationship or you've got kind of this
you know good ratio of positive and

00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:50.930
you know good ratio of positive and
 

00:20:50.930 --> 00:20:52.990
you know good ratio of positive and
negative but in that paradigm you know

00:20:52.990 --> 00:20:53.000
negative but in that paradigm you know
 

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:54.850
negative but in that paradigm you know
you as a person that relationship you're

00:20:54.850 --> 00:20:54.860
you as a person that relationship you're
 

00:20:54.860 --> 00:20:56.500
you as a person that relationship you're
you are yourself you can't you're not a

00:20:56.500 --> 00:20:56.510
you are yourself you can't you're not a
 

00:20:56.510 --> 00:20:58.180
you are yourself you can't you're not a
machine you can't switch who you are and

00:20:58.180 --> 00:20:58.190
machine you can't switch who you are and
 

00:20:58.190 --> 00:20:59.620
machine you can't switch who you are and
have an equally effective relationship

00:20:59.620 --> 00:20:59.630
have an equally effective relationship
 

00:20:59.630 --> 00:21:01.840
have an equally effective relationship
with somebody else you can do that in

00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:01.850
with somebody else you can do that in
 

00:21:01.850 --> 00:21:03.490
with somebody else you can do that in
your product right so you can be a

00:21:03.490 --> 00:21:03.500
your product right so you can be a
 

00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:05.710
your product right so you can be a
different person to it to one user and

00:21:05.710 --> 00:21:05.720
different person to it to one user and
 

00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:09.460
different person to it to one user and
another to another user is that I guess

00:21:09.460 --> 00:21:09.470
another to another user is that I guess
 

00:21:09.470 --> 00:21:10.840
another to another user is that I guess
how do you think about that when you're

00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:10.850
how do you think about that when you're
 

00:21:10.850 --> 00:21:11.950
how do you think about that when you're
built and you know for others in the

00:21:11.950 --> 00:21:11.960
built and you know for others in the
 

00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:13.240
built and you know for others in the
audience who are either building your

00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:13.250
audience who are either building your
 

00:21:13.250 --> 00:21:16.240
audience who are either building your
own natural language interface or are

00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:16.250
own natural language interface or are
 

00:21:16.250 --> 00:21:17.260
own natural language interface or are
you just kind of thinking about your

00:21:17.260 --> 00:21:17.270
you just kind of thinking about your
 

00:21:17.270 --> 00:21:19.870
you just kind of thinking about your
brand personality do you stay as one

00:21:19.870 --> 00:21:19.880
brand personality do you stay as one
 

00:21:19.880 --> 00:21:22.210
brand personality do you stay as one
brand or do you mimic whatever the user

00:21:22.210 --> 00:21:22.220
brand or do you mimic whatever the user
 

00:21:22.220 --> 00:21:24.310
brand or do you mimic whatever the user
wants and what are the trade-offs there

00:21:24.310 --> 00:21:24.320
wants and what are the trade-offs there
 

00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:26.760
wants and what are the trade-offs there
and how do you guys think about that

00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:26.770
and how do you guys think about that
 

00:21:26.770 --> 00:21:30.000
and how do you guys think about that
yeah well I'll jump in here and say that

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:30.010
yeah well I'll jump in here and say that
 

00:21:30.010 --> 00:21:32.110
yeah well I'll jump in here and say that
one interesting thing that happened in

00:21:32.110 --> 00:21:32.120
one interesting thing that happened in
 

00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:34.270
one interesting thing that happened in
the past year with hooked that we

00:21:34.270 --> 00:21:34.280
the past year with hooked that we
 

00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:35.860
the past year with hooked that we
noticed is that when we first started

00:21:35.860 --> 00:21:35.870
noticed is that when we first started
 

00:21:35.870 --> 00:21:38.260
noticed is that when we first started
collecting stories for the app our main

00:21:38.260 --> 00:21:38.270
collecting stories for the app our main
 

00:21:38.270 --> 00:21:39.790
collecting stories for the app our main
goal was to get stories that were super

00:21:39.790 --> 00:21:39.800
goal was to get stories that were super
 

00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:41.980
goal was to get stories that were super
addicting because we're like okay goal

00:21:41.980 --> 00:21:41.990
addicting because we're like okay goal
 

00:21:41.990 --> 00:21:43.960
addicting because we're like okay goal
is to get people to read how do you do

00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:43.970
is to get people to read how do you do
 

00:21:43.970 --> 00:21:46.360
is to get people to read how do you do
that you need like BuzzFeed of fiction

00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:46.370
that you need like BuzzFeed of fiction
 

00:21:46.370 --> 00:21:48.250
that you need like BuzzFeed of fiction
you need it to be super addicting people

00:21:48.250 --> 00:21:48.260
you need it to be super addicting people
 

00:21:48.260 --> 00:21:50.590
you need it to be super addicting people
want to tap get to the end and so when

00:21:50.590 --> 00:21:50.600
want to tap get to the end and so when
 

00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:51.880
want to tap get to the end and so when
we first started out we incentivized

00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:51.890
we first started out we incentivized
 

00:21:51.890 --> 00:21:54.400
we first started out we incentivized
authors for that particular metric the

00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:54.410
authors for that particular metric the
 

00:21:54.410 --> 00:21:55.840
authors for that particular metric the
metric of success we were measuring was

00:21:55.840 --> 00:21:55.850
metric of success we were measuring was
 

00:21:55.850 --> 00:21:57.840
metric of success we were measuring was
completion rate of stories

00:21:57.840 --> 00:21:57.850
completion rate of stories
 

00:21:57.850 --> 00:21:59.640
completion rate of stories
and so we collected a bunch of stories

00:21:59.640 --> 00:21:59.650
and so we collected a bunch of stories
 

00:21:59.650 --> 00:22:01.770
and so we collected a bunch of stories
that had really high engagement and you

00:22:01.770 --> 00:22:01.780
that had really high engagement and you
 

00:22:01.780 --> 00:22:03.779
that had really high engagement and you
know we thought all was going well and

00:22:03.779 --> 00:22:03.789
know we thought all was going well and
 

00:22:03.789 --> 00:22:07.380
know we thought all was going well and
then we ran sentiment analysis after we

00:22:07.380 --> 00:22:07.390
then we ran sentiment analysis after we
 

00:22:07.390 --> 00:22:08.640
then we ran sentiment analysis after we
had a good collection of stories I think

00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:08.650
had a good collection of stories I think
 

00:22:08.650 --> 00:22:12.510
had a good collection of stories I think
about like 200 250 on the comments and

00:22:12.510 --> 00:22:12.520
about like 200 250 on the comments and
 

00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:15.120
about like 200 250 on the comments and
the likes to loves ratios and like you

00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:15.130
the likes to loves ratios and like you
 

00:22:15.130 --> 00:22:16.710
the likes to loves ratios and like you
know the word the positive to negative

00:22:16.710 --> 00:22:16.720
know the word the positive to negative
 

00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:18.750
know the word the positive to negative
words in the comments we just you know

00:22:18.750 --> 00:22:18.760
words in the comments we just you know
 

00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:21.750
words in the comments we just you know
ran a huge analysis of can we gauge and

00:22:21.750 --> 00:22:21.760
ran a huge analysis of can we gauge and
 

00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:23.370
ran a huge analysis of can we gauge and
what people actually feel about this

00:22:23.370 --> 00:22:23.380
what people actually feel about this
 

00:22:23.380 --> 00:22:27.350
what people actually feel about this
story and what we learned is that people

00:22:27.350 --> 00:22:27.360
story and what we learned is that people
 

00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:30.990
story and what we learned is that people
hated cliffhanger endings they were so

00:22:30.990 --> 00:22:31.000
hated cliffhanger endings they were so
 

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:32.700
hated cliffhanger endings they were so
angry that they would get to the end of

00:22:32.700 --> 00:22:32.710
angry that they would get to the end of
 

00:22:32.710 --> 00:22:34.200
angry that they would get to the end of
his story and it wouldn't have this like

00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:34.210
his story and it wouldn't have this like
 

00:22:34.210 --> 00:22:36.240
his story and it wouldn't have this like
resolute kind of satisfying ending and

00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:36.250
resolute kind of satisfying ending and
 

00:22:36.250 --> 00:22:39.330
resolute kind of satisfying ending and
they fell almost betrayed and so what we

00:22:39.330 --> 00:22:39.340
they fell almost betrayed and so what we
 

00:22:39.340 --> 00:22:41.520
they fell almost betrayed and so what we
saw is that well first of all it's

00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:41.530
saw is that well first of all it's
 

00:22:41.530 --> 00:22:42.930
saw is that well first of all it's
really hard to write a good ending to

00:22:42.930 --> 00:22:42.940
really hard to write a good ending to
 

00:22:42.940 --> 00:22:44.730
really hard to write a good ending to
any story that's just like a challenge

00:22:44.730 --> 00:22:44.740
any story that's just like a challenge
 

00:22:44.740 --> 00:22:46.799
any story that's just like a challenge
of writing a good fiction story but it's

00:22:46.799 --> 00:22:46.809
of writing a good fiction story but it's
 

00:22:46.809 --> 00:22:48.419
of writing a good fiction story but it's
particularly challenging in a compressed

00:22:48.419 --> 00:22:48.429
particularly challenging in a compressed
 

00:22:48.429 --> 00:22:51.240
particularly challenging in a compressed
format with the goal of being super

00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:51.250
format with the goal of being super
 

00:22:51.250 --> 00:22:53.070
format with the goal of being super
engaging in such a short amount of time

00:22:53.070 --> 00:22:53.080
engaging in such a short amount of time
 

00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:55.740
engaging in such a short amount of time
and so we kind of went back to the

00:22:55.740 --> 00:22:55.750
and so we kind of went back to the
 

00:22:55.750 --> 00:22:56.970
and so we kind of went back to the
drawing board and we're like okay this

00:22:56.970 --> 00:22:56.980
drawing board and we're like okay this
 

00:22:56.980 --> 00:22:58.710
drawing board and we're like okay this
is clearly important from an emotional

00:22:58.710 --> 00:22:58.720
is clearly important from an emotional
 

00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:01.350
is clearly important from an emotional
perspective for our readers and so we

00:23:01.350 --> 00:23:01.360
perspective for our readers and so we
 

00:23:01.360 --> 00:23:03.450
perspective for our readers and so we
changed our incentive structure and and

00:23:03.450 --> 00:23:03.460
changed our incentive structure and and
 

00:23:03.460 --> 00:23:05.610
changed our incentive structure and and
asked authors to revisit their stories

00:23:05.610 --> 00:23:05.620
asked authors to revisit their stories
 

00:23:05.620 --> 00:23:07.110
asked authors to revisit their stories
and then moving forward like really

00:23:07.110 --> 00:23:07.120
and then moving forward like really
 

00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:09.360
and then moving forward like really
invest in thinking about how to write

00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:09.370
invest in thinking about how to write
 

00:23:09.370 --> 00:23:12.090
invest in thinking about how to write
endings with more closure and then we

00:23:12.090 --> 00:23:12.100
endings with more closure and then we
 

00:23:12.100 --> 00:23:13.980
endings with more closure and then we
reran the sentiment analysis and user

00:23:13.980 --> 00:23:13.990
reran the sentiment analysis and user
 

00:23:13.990 --> 00:23:16.200
reran the sentiment analysis and user
satisfaction just like shot way up and

00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:16.210
satisfaction just like shot way up and
 

00:23:16.210 --> 00:23:19.200
satisfaction just like shot way up and
so I use the Sun as an example because I

00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:19.210
so I use the Sun as an example because I
 

00:23:19.210 --> 00:23:21.390
so I use the Sun as an example because I
think it wasn't though in retrospect

00:23:21.390 --> 00:23:21.400
think it wasn't though in retrospect
 

00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:23.250
think it wasn't though in retrospect
it's obvious it wasn't something we were

00:23:23.250 --> 00:23:23.260
it's obvious it wasn't something we were
 

00:23:23.260 --> 00:23:24.539
it's obvious it wasn't something we were
really thinking about in the beginning

00:23:24.539 --> 00:23:24.549
really thinking about in the beginning
 

00:23:24.549 --> 00:23:27.140
really thinking about in the beginning
and this was something we heard from our

00:23:27.140 --> 00:23:27.150
and this was something we heard from our
 

00:23:27.150 --> 00:23:30.149
and this was something we heard from our
readers you know like across the board

00:23:30.149 --> 00:23:30.159
readers you know like across the board
 

00:23:30.159 --> 00:23:32.279
readers you know like across the board
that they wanted and so we did sort of

00:23:32.279 --> 00:23:32.289
that they wanted and so we did sort of
 

00:23:32.289 --> 00:23:34.140
that they wanted and so we did sort of
maneuver ourselves to cater to that

00:23:34.140 --> 00:23:34.150
maneuver ourselves to cater to that
 

00:23:34.150 --> 00:23:36.060
maneuver ourselves to cater to that
because what it taught us is that

00:23:36.060 --> 00:23:36.070
because what it taught us is that
 

00:23:36.070 --> 00:23:38.370
because what it taught us is that
measuring based on just one metric

00:23:38.370 --> 00:23:38.380

00:23:38.380 --> 00:23:40.440
measuring based on just one metric
engagement isn't enough we have to

00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:40.450
engagement isn't enough we have to
 

00:23:40.450 --> 00:23:42.840
engagement isn't enough we have to
always ask ourself with every story what

always ask ourself with every story what
is the emotional experience that this

00:23:44.430 --> 00:23:44.440
is the emotional experience that this
 

00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:46.529
is the emotional experience that this
person is potentially having with this

piece as a whole is it good or is it bad
 

00:23:48.429 --> 00:23:50.100
piece as a whole is it good or is it bad
and if it's bad we need to figure out

00:23:50.100 --> 00:23:50.110
and if it's bad we need to figure out
 

00:23:50.110 --> 00:23:53.730
and if it's bad we need to figure out
how to make it good yeah yeah imagine I

00:23:53.730 --> 00:23:53.740

maybe this isn't the exact same question

00:24:44.529 --> 00:24:44.539
maybe this isn't the exact same question
 

00:24:44.539 --> 00:24:46.330
maybe this isn't the exact same question
you're asking but we we've looked we

00:24:46.330 --> 00:24:46.340
you're asking but we we've looked we
 

00:24:46.340 --> 00:24:47.680
you're asking but we we've looked we
look at a lot of the digital assistants

00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:47.690
look at a lot of the digital assistants
 

00:24:47.690 --> 00:24:49.119
look at a lot of the digital assistants
because pancho is kind of a digital

00:24:49.119 --> 00:24:49.129
because pancho is kind of a digital
 

00:24:49.129 --> 00:24:51.519
because pancho is kind of a digital
assistant in some ways and one of the

00:24:51.519 --> 00:24:51.529
assistant in some ways and one of the
 

00:24:51.529 --> 00:24:53.440

things we consciously decided we didn't

00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:53.450
things we consciously decided we didn't

accommodate it um you know because I
think that one of the one of the issues

00:25:00.700 --> 00:25:00.710
think that one of the one of the issues
 

00:25:00.710 --> 00:25:02.019
think that one of the one of the issues
with digital assistants is that they're

00:25:02.019 --> 00:25:02.029
with digital assistants is that they're
 

00:25:02.029 --> 00:25:04.990
with digital assistants is that they're
they're pretty subservience and and when

00:25:04.990 --> 00:25:05.000
they're pretty subservience and and when
 

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:06.159
they're pretty subservience and and when
and because they all have female

00:25:06.159 --> 00:25:06.169
and because they all have female
 

00:25:06.169 --> 00:25:07.480
and because they all have female
personalities it's sort of like even

00:25:07.480 --> 00:25:07.490

and I think when we tend to design stuff

00:31:06.410 --> 00:31:06.420
and I think when we tend to design stuff
 

00:31:06.420 --> 00:31:08.210
and I think when we tend to design stuff
we look at it within the container so

00:31:08.210 --> 00:31:08.220
we look at it within the container so
 

00:31:08.220 --> 00:31:10.130
we look at it within the container so
it's like blow away the container and

00:31:10.130 --> 00:31:10.140
it's like blow away the container and
