00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Now I want you to define the successor function for this problem.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
We'll give you a hint that a state is of that form.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Return all the successors. The successors should be a dictionary as before.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.000
We want to include successor states that result in cannibals being able to eat,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
but such a state should have no successors itself.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
In other words, we're free to generate a successor state that has, say,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
two cannibals and one missionary in one location,

00:00:32.000 --> 09:59:59.000
but if we're given such a state then we should return the empty dictionary of successors.
