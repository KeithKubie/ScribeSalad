00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.920
From literature to plays and movies throughout the world,

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:07.680
Humanity's fascination with love is just as strong as our obsession with heartbreak.

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:14.200
But, is a broken heart simply an abstract concept, or are there real physical affects on the body and the brain?

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:20.300
Whenever you endure physical pain, such as a cut or injury, the anterior cingulate cortex is stimulated.

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:27.040
Surprisingly, it's the same region of the brain that's activated when you feel excluded or experience the loss of a social relationship.

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:31.360
Perhaps physical pain and emotional pain aren't as different as we once thought.

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:33.800
Think about the ways in which we describe lost love.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.080
"He ripped my heart out", "it was a slap in the face", "I'm emotionally scarred."

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.240
This use of physical description

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:44.720
paints a clear relationship, at least in language, between emotional and physical pain.

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.840
In fact, studies have shown that human beings would rather

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.440
be physically hurt than feel social exclusion.

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.960
But why would these two different experiences

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.120
elicit the same feeling in our bodies?

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.860
It's clear that our bodies use physical pain to prevent

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:59.320
the risk of imminent danger.

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.300
But, from an evolutionary perspective,

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.740
anything that increases our overall survival and fitness as a species

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.240
is likely to persist.

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.960
The rise of relationships and social bonds between lovers and friends alike

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.260
became an important part of survival for many species.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.480
You look out for me, and I'll look out for you.

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:18.820
And just like your desire to not be burned by hot coffee again,

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.740
animals desire not to be socially alone.

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:25.140
The pain from both instances increases our chance of survival

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.460
by avoiding less desirable outcomes.

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.860
You're more likely to survive and reproduce

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:30.800
if you're not alone.

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.860
This can be see in studies of primates

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:34.580
who, when separated from loved ones,

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:36.580
experienced an increase in the hormone cortisol

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:38.440
and a decrease in the hormone norepinephrine,

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.660
causing a major stress response.

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:45.180
Ultimately, this contributes to the depression, anxiety, and loud crying documented.

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.680
For humans, a break up, loss of a loved one, or isolation

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:50.340
can trigger a similar reaction,

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.480
creating the perception of physical pain.

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:54.740
So, how can we alleviate this pain?

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.880
After all, band-aids or creams are meant for physical wounds.

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.780
Studies have shown that high levels of social support

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.760
are related to low levels of pain,

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:06.460
whereas socially alienated individuals show poor adjustment.

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:07.940
So if you're feeling brokenhearted,

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:09.780
surround yourself with friends and family,

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.160
as difficult as it may seem.

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.380
And if someone you know is suffering emotionally,

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:14.960
be there for social support.

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:19.060
Because, scientifically, us humans -  we all just want to fit in somewhere.

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.240
