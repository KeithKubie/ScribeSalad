00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.049
I’m always cold, so I always have a sweater
on or near by.

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.850
But as I shiver through the chilly California
winter, I wonder, does my furry friend need

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:16.390
a sweater too?

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:20.800
With all that fur, you would think dogs and
cats have natural insulation and I mean sweaters

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.930
look pretty silly, so are they necessary?

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:27.720
Just like people, tolerance to cold varies
from dog to dog, some breeds might have more

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.290
insulating fat, some might have denser fur.

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:34.980
But no dog can withstand winter weather with
the exceptions of some breeds like the sheepdog,

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.930
Chow Chow, St. Bernards, and Huskies.

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.199
Huskies are especially built for the cold.

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:41.410
They double up their fur to stay warm.

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:45.339
The undercoat is soft and fluffy for insulation
while the top coat is coarser and protects

00:00:45.339 --> 00:00:47.280
the undercoat from ice and snow buildup.

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.149
They can live and work in temperatures as
low as 75 degrees BELOW ZERO.

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.591
A Newfoundland might not need an extra layer
either, they grow out hair in locks, which

00:00:55.591 --> 00:00:57.960
provides another natural layer of warmth.

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.329
So much so, they don’t mind swimming in
near freezing temps!

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:04.970
On the other hand, smaller, lighter dog breeds
might need some help as they usually have

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:06.390
less body fat.

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.080
Dogs with shorter hair dogs like chihuahuas
and older dogs that struggle more to maintain

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.640
their body temperature probably need an extra
layer.

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:14.660
Listen to your pet.

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:18.590
If they seem hesitant to go do their business
in the cold, try bundling them up.

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.960
If you live in an especially snowy area, a
buildup of ice or snow can cause some nasty

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.440
abrasions on their feet.

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:28.040
Try some booties which help protect their
paws, plus you might get some good Vines out

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.070
of your dog prancing in their boots.

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:31.820
They look like such nerds.

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:33.940
Cats can get cold more easily than dogs actually.

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:39.990
Their body temperatures run hot, while we’re
98.1 degrees, cats run a toasty 101.5.

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.840
This means their range of comfy temperatures
is 20 degrees hotter than ours, their thermoneutral

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.690
zone ranges from 86 to 97 degrees.

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:51.750
Most houses seem pretty chilly to cats at
just 73.4 degrees.

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.020
So it doesn’t take winter weather for them
to feel cold.

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:01.570
Cats can be pretty fussy, so a feline sweater
is probably not the best option.

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:03.100
Boxes are best.

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.780
It’s no secret cats like boxes, I’m looking
at you Maru, they make them feel safer by

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.899
giving them a place to hide, but it also keeps
them warm.

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:14.810
Corrugated cardboard is an especially good
insulator, so there’s no need to buy a fancy

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.030
cat pod, just check your recycle bin!

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.450
On the extreme end of things, severe cold
can be deadly for pets - just like it is for

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:22.450
humans.

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:26.249
If left in the cold too long, dogs and cats
risk hyperthermia, especially if their coats

00:02:26.249 --> 00:02:27.249
get wet.

00:02:27.249 --> 00:02:31.310
They expend too much energy in keeping warm
and their blood pressure drops dangerously.

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.650
Which might lead to cardiac arrest.

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.769
So getting back to our original question:
does your pet need a sweater?

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:40.780
Depends on the dog, depends on the temperature.

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:44.950
Small dogs, dogs with little fur, or elderly
dogs, yeah. they could use one.

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:49.090
But it also depends on the sweater, I mean
if it’s an especially adorable sweater.

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:50.090
OF COURSE they need it.

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:51.090
So please don’t leave your pets out in the
winter, if you do, provide them with adequate

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:52.090
shelter.

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:53.090
There’s a link below that tells you how
to do just that.

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:54.090
What do you think?

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:55.090
Would you put your pooch in a sweater?

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:56.090
Or is it silly?

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:57.090
