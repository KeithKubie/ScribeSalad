00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.710
And the answer is this graph.

00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:05.240
And the way I figure this out was
looking it x equals zero first.

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:09.400
So along this line and noticing that
the y value has to be positive.

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:11.500
So maybe it's going to be this one, but

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:14.380
it's certainly not this graph
because y here is negative.

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:18.080
But then, to distinguish between this
and that graph I notice that as x got

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:23.700
bigger two, four y got smaller 6,
2 and that describes this graph.

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.000
X gets bigger, y goes down.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.490
x gets bigger, y goes down.
