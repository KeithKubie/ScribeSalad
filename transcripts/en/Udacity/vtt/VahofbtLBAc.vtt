00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:03.950
I knew that I wanted to iterate through all of the p tags on the page,

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:06.890
so I selected all the p tags and called .each on it.

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:11.795
I passed in the function numberAdder which I defined up here.

00:00:11.795 --> 00:00:15.320
NumberAdder simply finds the text that's already there.

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:18.350
Figures out how long it is and then changes the text

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:22.460
on each element to the same text plus a space and then a number.

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:24.760
When we hit Test Run we can see how it looks.

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:27.350
And check it out.

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:30.300
Now we've got how many characters are in each p tag.
