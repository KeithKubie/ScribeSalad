00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.010
- [Instructor] So let's
say that this is a cell.

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:09.070
So we know that all sorts
of activity is going on

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:12.020
inside of this cell here,
and we will study that

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:13.940
in a lot more depth as we go further

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:16.180
in our study of biology.

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:18.990
But it's important to
realize that this cell

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.240
and the activity in that cell
is not operating in isolation.

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:27.290
That in order to live,
that cell needs resources

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:29.110
from the outside world.

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:33.070
So resources need to
make their way through

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.210
that outer membrane of
the cell so it can be used

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.400
inside that cellular machinery.

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.840
And as that cell does what it does,

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.230
it's also going to
generate waste products,

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.410
and that needs to be released
somehow across that membrane.

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:50.060
So you also have waste.

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:53.350
And you also have energy that
is going to be transferred

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:55.470
either from the inside of
the cell to the outside

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:56.840
or from the outside to the inside.

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.420
A lotta times, we imagine
that all of the activity

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.140
inside the cell is
generating thermal energy

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:03.750
that has to be dissipated somehow,

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.130
and that is usually the case, not always.

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:11.130
And so you have thermal energy
that has to be dissipated.

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:14.810
Now you might see something interesting,

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:16.541
or maybe you haven't seen it just yet,

00:01:16.541 --> 00:01:19.810
is that you have all of
this activity operating

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:23.280
in the volume of the cell,
but then all of this exchange,

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.110
all of the resources coming
in, the waste coming out,

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:28.530
the thermal energy going
in either direction,

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.420
it has to be somehow
diffused across this surface,

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.110
across this two-dimensional surface.

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:37.430
So this raises an interesting question.

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:41.540
As our volume increases,
what happens to the ratio

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:43.450
of our surface to our volume?

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.560
Because you could imagine,
maybe at some point,

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.800
the volume gets large
enough that you don't have

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:51.580
enough surface area to do
these three things well.

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:53.540
And so let's think about this ratio.

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:58.480
Let's think about the ratio
of our surface area to volume.

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:00.480
And I'm gonna get a little bit mathy here.

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:02.700
You don't have to know
the math for the context

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.450
of a biology course, but you need to know

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.290
what the conclusion is that
the math is going to give us.

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.683
So if this is a sphere of radius r,

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.550
the surface area of this sphere

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:19.060
is going to be four pi r squared,

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.960
and the volume of this sphere

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:26.360
is going to be 4/3 pi r cubed.

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.930
So this pi would cancel with that pi.

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.450
If we divide the numerator and
the denominator by r squared,

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.080
we get a one there and
then we just get an r

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.100
right over here.

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:38.760
If we divide both of these
by four, you get a one there,

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.780
and this is just going to be a 1/3.

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.010
And so we are going to be left with

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:48.010
one over 1/3 r or we could just write this

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:51.120
is this is equal to three over r.

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.520
And so we see at least for
a spherical cell like this,

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:59.580
as r increases, as our cell
gets larger and larger,

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:03.660
the ratio between our surface
area to volume decreases.

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:04.493
So let me write that.

00:03:04.493 --> 00:03:08.540
As r goes up, then the ratio

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.320
between our surface area to
volume, surface area to volume,

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:12.490
is going to go down.

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:15.200
The bigger your denominator,
the lower the value

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:16.200
is going to be.

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.160
And so what that tells us
is is that as the volume

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.090
of our cell increases,
as our cell gets bigger

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.590
and bigger and bigger,
we have less surface area

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:24.920
per unit of volume.

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:28.280
And so it's going to make that
exchange of the resources,

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.750
the waste, and that energy
harder and harder and harder.

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:33.670
And we would get a
similar result if instead

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:36.860
of doing a spherical cell, let's
say we did a cuboidal cell.

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:40.300
So let's do it like this, a cuboidal cell.

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:42.030
You might see this in some plants,

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:43.430
something that's roughly cuboidal

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:45.110
or rectangular in some way,

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:46.890
or rectangular prism I should say.

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:50.200
But let's say it's x by x by x.

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:51.750
We could do the same exercise.

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:55.090
Our ratio of surface area to
volume is going to be what?

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:56.991
Well our surface area, you have six faces

00:03:56.991 --> 00:03:59.540
that are each have an area of x squared,

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:02.320
so our surface area's
going to be six x squared.

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:05.510
And then our volume is going
to be x times x times x,

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:07.090
over x to the third.

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:09.530
And so this is going to
be, divide the numerator

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:12.550
and denominator by x
squared, you get six over x.

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:15.820
So once again, you see
that as x increases,

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:19.430
our ratio of surface
area to volume decreases.

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:21.610
As our denominator increases,

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:26.120
well then that whole expression
is going to decrease.

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:28.770
So given this phenomena, it makes it hard

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:31.240
for larger and larger cells to exist.

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:34.150
Because for all the activity
happening in the volume,

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:36.070
they don't have enough surface area to do

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:38.300
all of this exchange.

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:41.360
Now there are things we
see in biological systems

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:44.380
that help cells get further
than what we see here.

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:46.480
If you imagine the
two-dimensional cross-section

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:50.710
of this cell, one way to increase
the surface area to volume

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:54.810
is for the membrane to
look more like this.

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:59.130
The more folds you have, the
higher surface area to volume

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:00.460
that you are going to have.

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:03.600
And you indeed see this
in a lot of biology.

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:06.470
Anytime you want a high
surface area to volume,

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:09.180
you tend to see things like these folds

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:11.323
in the membranes of the cells.
