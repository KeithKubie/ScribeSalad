00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:03.928
So we've seen using k-means
that clustering is a for,

00:00:03.928 --> 00:00:06.730
is that segmentation is
a form of clustering.

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:10.500
And so far we've just
clustered in intensity space.

00:00:11.562 --> 00:00:17.112
And things get more interesting as we
either add more interesting dimensions,

00:00:17.112 --> 00:00:19.000
that is other descriptors.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.455
And also using a clustering algorithm or

00:00:21.455 --> 00:00:26.375
a way of finding these clusters that
are be, that's better than just k-means.

00:00:26.375 --> 00:00:27.770
And that's what we're
going to talk about next.
