Speaker 1:          00:01          I'd like to see if I can describe to you how you could measure the bond energies of complex molecules. And to start out, let me just say that, let me remind you what we're talking about. Let me talk about somebody like methane. I'm going to need a larger stick. If you have methane and, uh, your, uh, want to measure the bond energy, I literally want to reach in and measure the energy it would take to grab that hydrogen and literally just rip it out of there. And when you can see it does that the molecule is going to have a change from a tetrahedral geometry to a flat geometry. And there's a potential curve that I've written as a more sauce later and, uh, there's a zero point energy and you're going to have to measure the energy to go from the ground state up to the, um, uh, dissociation limit.

Speaker 1:          00:51          Uh, so, uh, I thought I'd try to tell you just in a simple way, if you took a molecule and you'd like to try to see if you could measure the different bonds in a molecule, how could I, how could I, this specific bond energies being measured? And let me consider something like methanol. Uh, I'd like to take methanol and I'd like to show you how you measure the bond energy to break the Oah bond, then how you'd break the ch bond or how you'd break the Co Bong. And I don't want to calculate this. I actually want to measure, all right. So one way you can do this is to use a gas phase is acidity, uh, electronic electronegativity cycle. And this is a negative vine cycle that you'll take it, uh, this molecule, same ethanol. And if you treat this with a base such as flu, it's fluoride on fluoride ion is actually going to attack them ethanol.

Speaker 1:          01:55          And what it does is it's going to pull a proton off. And if it does that, you'll form methoxy line. Um, um, you'll never, the fluoride ion will never pull the proton off the, the, uh, the off the carbon because the negative ion that you get has the electron sitting on the carbon and electric and the oxygen is more electronegative. So you'll always get the top line. And uh, so if you could do that, what you'd like to, um, um, think about is how could I measure it? An equilibrium between these two species. And, uh, if I have the equilibrium, I can get the anthropy and if I can get the anthropy, I can get the acidity of this. Uh, so this is, um, uh, uh, an experiment that a bunch of us do in boulder. Uh, the world's expert in these gas phase acidity measurements is my colleague, uh, Ronnie Bierbaum, uh, professor Doctor Veronica Murray Bierbaum.

Speaker 1:          02:57          Uh, and uh, she's very good at this. Uh, they have a flow tube and what they do is, uh, you, this is the experiment you want to do. So you would like to measure the, the, the reaction of fluoride on pulling a proton off methanol to get the methoxy Diane. So what you do is, is you have to, here, you can't get a lecture bottle of fluoride on cause it because they're, they're charged. So what you got to do is take a, a gas and you make a plasma, you boil electrons off a filament in the, as electrons interact with the, with the HF, the electrons get captured into a sigma star, orbital in the molecule detonates and gives you f minus and hydrogen atoms. So the hydrogen atoms are injected or the fluoride ions are a, are, are injected into this flow tube and there's some ethanol in here.

Speaker 1:          03:50          And what happens is, uh, as the reaction proceeds, the methanol has a proton removed from it. And you have, you're literally watching the end of the flow tube with a quarter pole mass spec. The quadrupole mass spec monitors the negative vines that have emo Rizzy 31 and you'll watch them growing in. So as you watch the, the mythos oxide on growing in, you can measure the rate constant k one that goes this way. So if you do that, what you're after is the equilibrium constants. So you've got to get to get the equilibrium constant. One way to do this is that you would measure the reverse rate. Uh, so if you did that to, to, to measure such a reaction, now you did turn the reacts. You, you do the reverse of this, you now have to make a, uh, a vapor of methoxy water and ions.

Speaker 1:          04:42          Uh, an easy way to do this is to have electrons interact with methyl nitrite. The methyl nitrite then disintegrates and informs methodic side and on, and nitric oxide, you know, in the methoxy line, then goes down the flow to, and there's a methoxy side on interacts with the HF. Now what you'll see as f minus growing in that's, and you know, it's f minus because Jesus only made a finite number of irons that have emo Rizzy 19 in floor high does it? There's no other, so it turns out when you do that, you're able to, to monitor this. So if you've measured k one and you've measured k minus one, uh, that is going to give you the equilibrium constant. Uh, and this is the difference in acidity between methanol and HF. With the acidity of a, of Hf is well known. It's a 303 70 cake, a 0.4, two, four k cal per mall with this uncertainty.

Speaker 1:          05:38          And so it turns out that that, uh, your, uh, these two numbers gives you the equilibrium constant and this is going to give you the, uh, the, the, uh, the gas phase acidity. So by measuring the, the equilibrium constant, professor Bierbaum has the measure of the acidity of this species. Um, the way to think about this now, to use the acidity, here's what the gas phase acidity is. Remember, she's really has this number in the gas phase. You know, in the gas phase, these molecules are never going to do this, dissociate into ions because the, the, the you guys, you got to deal with cool ohms law. So you're talking about maybe a 300, 400 k cal per mall. So it's a whopping amount of energy. So the way to think about this is, is to get that iron, you have to, you have to, uh, you have to break the Ooh bond.

Speaker 1:          06:32          Then you have to, uh, and then to get a, then you have to somehow measure the electron affinity that gives you the, the, the energy of, of the negative in here. And the ionization energy of a hydrogen atom is the, the is, is how you get the Proton. And, and here, this is the easiest way I think about this. That's this acidity. You want to get those ions, the first thing you got to do is reach in with a pair of scissors and cut this bond with you. So you've got to pay that energy. You also got to give me the ionization energy of hydrogen atom. You got to pay me that. Uh, and because that gives you, that gives you the Proton and then you take the electron and put her back on, on the, um, uh, [inaudible], uh, uh, Coxy radical. And that's the electron affinity.

Speaker 1:          07:17          So it turns out I'm here, this is what we're after. We want this bond energy. And, and this will be the energy for that bond only. Uh, and uh, so the electron affinity for hydrogen atom is known to some pornographic the tail. You couldn't imagine what's been done to this poor Adam. This is known to like 80 digits. So it turns out, so the only thing you got to do is now you now have to measure the electron affinity of the radical. Alright, so how are you going to do that? So, um, this is an experiment that's done in, uh, uh, actually here by Mark Johnson, it professor Mark Johnson at the Yale University, and it's done a bit by people in Boulder, Colorado. Uh, here's what you do. You literally take a vapor of these negative vines, and if you take a vapor of the negative vines, you make a fast beam.

Speaker 1:          08:14          Uh, you crosses with the laser. I know the, I know the energy of the laser precisely. So what you do is when the laser interacts with the negative ions, uh, you'll eject electrons and you catch them in a, in a hemispherical analyzer, and you literally measure the kinetic energy. So this is a kinetic energy. So here, this is easy. If the, you know what the energy going in is and you know, at the energy coming out is you've measured those two things, then the differences of binding energy. So here's the, the, the, the negative vine. Uh, when the, the electromagnetic wave comes, comes a blazing in and strikes it, what happens is that here's the laser energy. So the molecule literally interacts with the laser and an electrons knocked off, and that what you're going to do is you're going to measure the red arrow.

Speaker 1:          09:04          This is the kinetic energy of the photo electron. So if you've measured what comes out, then the difference is the binding energy. So, uh, it turns out that, uh, um, this is this, the essential experiments you have to do. Um, there's a bunch of details. You got to pay attention to you. If the, if the, the product radical is vibrating than the fuddle electron, kinetic energy will be smaller than the measured. Uh, binding energy in this are just a bunch of words. Let me just show you what you do. This is it. Uh, uh, you make them hear what this is. Jesus, we did this like 30 years ago. Christ, I'm an old guy. Uh, uh, if, when, when you do this, what you do is you take a, a, the, uh, the, the uh, uh, right here. So what you're gonna do is you're going to measure the kinetic energy of the electrons coming down.

Speaker 1:          09:56          So we're making a plot of the photo electron, kinetic energy here, let me just show the laser is at a is 488. It's a beautiful Robin's egg blue, extremely bright, uh, laser and a four 88 nanometers is 2.54 electron volts. So here, think about this. This is a photo on kinetic energy. Electrons coming out. No electrons can come out with more than 2.5 for e v because that's all that's all I got to put in. So, so the first time you see electron counts, this electron council is, uh, had, uh, at about one eve. When you actually measured, it's measured to be a 0.96 80 v. Uh, and so the way you get the electron affinity is if you put 2.5 fours evn and, and you measure a 0.968 coming out, then the difference is 1.572 a plus and minus 4 million electron volts. And that's how you do it.

Speaker 1:          10:53          Um, this is, this is the attachment to the ground state of the, of, of the methoxy. Dot. This is one vibration. Hinton methoxy doc, this is two vibrations. This is three vibrations. Can you see how coolest is? You can actually take a vibrational spectrum. You're looking at the vibrations that are radical. Well, that's not hard. That's not easy to do because you don't have a lecture bottle of radical. So this is, uh, this is a very powerful experiments on the one day of the month when it works, I'll not kid you, uh, these experiments or professor at Bierbaum, uh, you spend most of your time with the hardware, uh, trying to make, certainly electronics is stable and whatnot. And then when you're running a, these people basically are dancing around the machine nude with tambourines, just trying to keep the machine stable along enough to get a spectrum.

Speaker 1:          11:40          But when it works, uh, it's, you're going to get a number of very clean and you see how precise this is. I mean, this is a very, this is a very nice measurement. So now you can now do the, we can now do what gonna do if Bierbaum ms has the acidity and you know, the electron affinity and you know, they, I on Istation as you hydrogen atom. So here are these numbers. Uh, uh, uh, when you put these things in, you gotta have to, the bond energy is about 105 k cal per mole. And this is the bond energy of methanol in intergalactic space with nobody else around. Um, and all of these people who liked to think they can calculate everything's by using all these quantum mechanical programs. Now this is the number they have to get there. There's no place to hide.

Speaker 1:          12:28          This is a cleanly measured, uh, value. Uh, um, no experimental system is perfect. Uh, so for example, uh, so problems you could have, um, I just showed you how to measure the Oah Blonde. Suppose you wanted to mention at the ch bond, well, this will never work. Uh, because for the negative line cycle will never work. Why? Because when you take, uh, any base that you apply to this, the base is always going to take off the most acidic protons will. The most acidic Proton is one of the Doh because you get the negative line with, uh, with the electron on the oxygen. That's good. Uh, if you have a base that you try to pull a proton off the carbon, you're now going to put, the electron is going to be on the carbon atom and that's bad music. Oxygen is more electronegative, it'll hold it much tighter.

Speaker 1:          13:22          So it turns out, uh, this is the negative lines is our, are not going to be a useful way to do this. Uh, and of course, if you were going to apply the negative ions cycle, then you have to measure the acidity of the negative of this proton. Then we'd have to measure the electron affinity. Of this radical, does everybody see that? This radical, this is hydroxy methyl radical is different than methoxy because the dot sits on the carbon, not on the oxygen. So it's a different radical. So if you can't make the iron, then we can't do our measurements and we're dead not to worry. Um, there's other techniques you can do. Uh, um, my friend David Goodman, uh, he does, uh, does radical kinetics. And uh, so, uh, thing you can do is you can take, make chlorine atoms. And when you make chlorine atoms and in a flow tube, uh, he can, uh, you, he uses photo organization Mass Spec to monitor the products. And so he can measure k one and he can measure k minus one. So he gets equal.

Speaker 1:          14:25          A flow tube is a beautiful device. Uh, that's a meter long. Uh, it's, uh, uh, my fist 10 centimeters in diameter and a beer Bierbaum has flowing through this, a tremendous flow of helium gas. And, uh, so when you make ions, the ions are made up here in the discharge and then there are little pressure. The pressure will be about a tour. And, uh, so it turns out that that, uh, it's mostly helium and you have a few milli torr of the reagents that you've got. Do you have a quadrupole Mass Spec? Uh, the quadrupole mass back of course, can't operate in a milliliter. So there's some clever, um, um, um, uh, pumping that you have to sample the, uh, the output of the float tube. And so the quadrupole mass spec only looks at the ions. So if you have a reaction that occurs in here, a one iron would go away and another and another one would come up.

Speaker 1:          15:22          And you can monitor this with a quadrupole mass spec. Uh, remember the way the ions get downstream as they were carried along by the helium. So that, and, and what's two and a flow tube is, is the distance equals rate times the time. So if you have a shorter distance, you have a shorter reaction time. If you have a longer distance, you have a longer reaction time. And if you measure that variation, you can get a rate concert though. Uh, it turns out that, uh, you can change the distance by, uh, uh, a admitting your reagent through a tiny little tube. And this tube is the cutest little thing you ever saw in your life. It slides on a little wire and they literally like a gorilla. Uh, they'll, they'll set the flow tube. Uh, they'll set the injection, uh, um, a tube, uh, at a certain, uh, a space.

Speaker 1:          16:13          And then what they'll do is they'll systematically vary this by just pulling both, by simply pulling this back. Then they'll measure the ratios of these rates. We talked earlier about Robert Hook make you go back. You know, you have somebody down now. Now it turns out that, sure. Okay. So the, uh, uh, uh, professor Bierbaum uses a set of pumps, which are, are as tall, as big as I am, their roots floors. Uh, these pumps can, we'll pump just a staggering quantity of gas, uh, like 500 liters a second at this pressure. Uh, so, uh, these pumps, he could, I'm just telling you words. Uh, one of the uses of these pumps are to pump grain and grain elevators in Kansas. You ever been to some dreadful place like Kansas? I mean there's, there's, there's 10,000 of these silos and uh, and so, uh, these, the grain is pumped around in these with these huge pumps.

Speaker 1:          17:13          So she has two of these in the basement. Uh, uh, uh, so it's, uh, it, it's a very hard experiment to do. So you can also do radicals in this. And let me just tell you Goodmans experiment. Uh, uh, uh, he's gonna measure k Eqi and so he's going to measure the reaction from the, from an equilibrium constant for the temperature variation of the equilibrium constant. He's going to get the, the, the uh, uh, enter the, the, the, the reaction energy of this and their reaction energy of this radical reaction is you're going to have to pay the bond energy, this ch bond energy, and you're going to get the bond energy of hcl. I now have to tell you something. The bond energy for ACL is known to be 103 k cal per mole. Remember I told you the bond energy for methanol is 104.

Speaker 1:          17:59          So meth. So the chloride Adams. If they hit the hydrogen h on the end, on the ois group, if they hit it, they'll just bounce off because they don't have enough energy to do this. So they're only going to pull a bond. And, uh, the, the carbon off the, the hydrogens off the, off the methyl group. So when you do that a way, if you do the analysis, you can get that. The ch bond, um, on methanol is, uh, is 96K cal per mole. And, uh, on the days when it works, you can get this very precisely. So those are two of the bond energies that you could, you can get from ethanol. Uh, so you might wonder what's the CEO bond and methanol. In other words, uh, you're literally going to take, take a methadone molecule, you'll karate chocolate in this, in the center, and you just want to cut it into.

Speaker 1:          18:47          So that means I've got to measure that the, uh, that the energy of the methyl radicals and hydroxyl radicals. Uh, so it turns out this is a straight forward thing to do. Uh, uh, turns out that, that, uh, if you want to look at this, that this bond energy is the, uh, uh, uh, to get the heater from here, I need to get methyl radical. So of get methyl radical, you actually have to measure the bond energy of methane cause that's the bond energy of methanes. That is the, is the heat of formation of methyl radicals, heat information, hydrogen minus that of methane. So Fun quantization Mass Spec or can our reaction kinetics both measure the bond energy of methane to be 104.99 k cal from all the bond energy of hydrogen, h and m comes from the dissociation energy of h two. So there's classical tables.

Speaker 1:          19:39          This, these guys, uh, Mr Pedley in his friends, there's 3000 of these bond energies that these guys ain't really have connect, have put in this book. So it turns out that that, uh, if you have these guys, uh, you now use the, the heat of formation of methyl radical. Uh, I also tell you that you need to tell you that, that the bond energy of water gives you the heat of formation of methyl radical, of, of hydroxyl radical. So it turns out, if I know hydroxyl radical, and I know methyl radical than Pedley at Al will give you the heat of formation of, of methanol, so that this is the other thing I'm going to need. So it turns out that that, uh, the bond, this bond energy is equal to heat of formation of methyl radical plus Oah radical minus that of methanol. And so this comes from water that comes to mind, energy of methane, dissociation and thing.

Speaker 1:          20:29          And this is mister pedley. And so that's actually the weakest bond in the molecule, the weakest bond in the molecules, the CEO bond. So you can actually, you can work all three of these, of these bonds out, uh, by, uh, um, by going through our procedure. Uh, me and a whole bunch of other really smart people have measured a large number of these molecules. And, uh, these are the, the bond energies. There's all sorts of, of, uh, complicated. Um, uh, uh, uh, uh, heats of formation that you can use. Uh, uh, let me just talk here at the end. Uh, for the last part of this about, uh, trying to compare these things. Uh, as one of professor McBride's typically going on like a broken record, he, we always start, tries to say, how do you know what you've done? So, so which means to say, here, I'm not kidding you. It is very easy to make a mistake. If you get any of these calibrations wrong or any of these little cycles are, are done in an incorrect manner, it's very easy for you to, to, uh, uh, uh, to have an uninstall it. Indeed. Let me go back and make, I need to make one point. I wasn't, I didn't, I wasn't smart enough to do, uh, where I had this acidity here.

Speaker 1:          21:49          The, yes, this bond energy that we're going to measure. Okay, we're going to get this through a cycle and to get through the cycle, we have to, to, we have to do two difficult experiments. Bierbaum has to measure the acidity. That's a very large number. That's 380 k cal per mole. And the electron affinity is known, but then, uh, the organization as you've hydrogen atoms down. But you have to measure the electron affinity for, uh, for this radical. So this number, it comes from a cycle where you're adding and subtracting large numbers and you're smart guys, you know this, if you have a number that you're after and it's it, there's a cycle that you go through and you're taking differences of large numbers. Any fault, any mistake that's made here is going to be in that era, has got to be in this bond energy or any air that comes in this measurement.

Speaker 1:          22:40          Uh, there's a famous chemist in who's English, whose name is Colson. And the Colson used to say this is procedure is like weighing a captain on a ship by weighing the ship with and without the captain here. So you have an aircraft carrier, okay, you're a smart guy, you get open, you get a pair of scales and now you've got, you have to measure this aircraft carrier very the way to this very precisely. And then you put a little guy on top and then the white is going to change just a titch and you have to, ear measurements have to be so precise. You can pick this up. So on the days when it works, uh, you can, uh, really get these bond energies, but, but it's, it, these are not easy experiments to do. Um, let me, um, uh, talk here about these bond energies.

Speaker 1:          23:26          Uh, here we've done several of these things. You might guess a that if you have, um, um, um, an alcoholic, this is, I did methanol, this is the [inaudible] bond and methanol, you might hope that the Oah bond and ethanol would be the same and it's exactly the same within our, with the NRN certainty. If you go to, uh, this is ISO propyl alcohol or this is tp, it'll alcohol. TB allow calls a little bit larger, but you could see amongst friends it's all about 104 hundred, five k cal promote. Um, when you got to measure something like funnel, this is an Ooh bond in front all, but this is only like 86 k cal per mole. And you go to Christ. What's wrong here? Well, this is no regular alcohol. Uh, uh, uh, here, I drew this. If you, if you, if, uh, you break the bond in methanol, you get a hydrogen atom and you get an methoxy.

Speaker 1:          24:31          Dot. And the.is stuck on the oxygen atom. But if you, if you pull a proton off funnel all, now the.is on, is not on the oxygen, is actually d localized around it interacts with the Pi system and, uh, uh, McBride's probably drawn you some of these residents forms or, uh, you can talk about the interaction of this extra electron with a Pi cloud. Uh, uh, this, uh, this is a catastrophic change. What? This is like 20 k, cal promote. That's a volt. So this is, it's a lot easier for you to pull a, remove a hydrogen atom from funnel than it is for, from any alcohol. Um, the, uh, we've also done a bunch of Peroxides, uh, here. Um, remember here's hydrogen peroxide, here's methyl hydroperoxide. Here's Ethel hydroperoxide. Uh, these again look like Ooh bonds. Uh, here. You're also smart people. You know that these peroxides are, they're very reactive compounds.

Speaker 1:          25:38          The reason my daughter's a blonde is because of this. I mean, you can buy a bottle of this and only here when, let's say there's a difference between chemistry and say, AH, other subjects in that these molecules are real. Uh, uh, when we got to do this, uh, here, my daughter would get, uh, you can buy a bottle of peroxide in the pharmacy for like it's 5%. So it's 5% hydrogen peroxide in [inaudible] 95% water. So we had gotten, they have to make a beam of these things. So there's clever ways that if you can have these compounds and you can actually distill them and you can make 99% hydrogen peroxide. Um, the hydrogen peroxide, of course, it's extremely reactive. Why is it reactive? Is because the two oxygens are held together by a single bond and you have all these electrons that are crammed right on top of each other so that the bond energy of the AU bon is actually quite week.

Speaker 1:          26:33          Uh, so it, it's a very good oxidizer. Uh, and, uh, so it turns out, uh, I've actually, we had a bottle of that 99% of this stuff, and I'm talking to this with Mike, my students, and I'm not very skillful. And so it turns out they maybe had about half a milliliter of this as long as hydrogen peroxide's in, um, glass or plastic. It's fine. Nothing's going to happen. It's, it's, you can, uh, you can, uh, handle it safely, but it will oxidize any carbon that it gets too. So alas, I dropped it and then when I dropped it, it bounced once on the floor and then it broke and went broke the w when the glass came down in a broken foot and there's a big orange spot around. And what happened was all the, all the dirt and stuff on the floor is oxidized immediately just gone.

Speaker 1:          27:27          Okay. So, uh, so if you have a solution of here, it's like, I'm kidding. You have a, you'd have a hundred percent solution of something like this. You take the little bunny rabbit with the ears and sort of lower this thing in this thing is, is, is just simply torn to pieces. Then you pull this thing out. There's, there's just bones. I mean this is, this is tremendous, is this tremendously reactive. So all of these things, you have to handle them and you've got to get them into your spectrometer. But we, okay, but when, so when you do this, you see that the yellow h bonds here, see the dots steer on this is, is, is like, this is 88 k cal promo. This is a lot different than these guys. And of course the one that's the, that that you're really interested in is water.

Speaker 1:          28:12          Okay? The bond energy for water is 118 and that goes to o h. Dot. And h. And m. Uh, this is uh, uh, this is an important number. And remember water covers 70% of the earth's surface here. If you're making a list of what are the most stable compounds that God made, it's into in the air. 80% of the night of the air we're breathing is into, into has got a triple bond. It's indestructable very, very saveable. Uh, the sand on beaches. I mean the silicon dioxide, the sand is just like a rock. I mean, it is a rock. And, and, and then the other thing is, is our, is water 70% of the earth's surface. And the reason is so stable is, is if you want to break this apart to radicals, you got to give me a 118 k cal promote. That's a whopping amount of energy, uh, here.

Speaker 1:          29:05          And so you notice if you just replaced, this was a, uh, an ethyl group. Okay? So, so, so you make ethanol. So it, the bond energy is going to drop by almost a volt to 104 k cal per mole. Here, imagine you have a swimming pool, a here. So there's a swimming pool. Johnny Depp is talking to somebody next to the swimming pool. Oh, instead of the swimming pool, you have water, you have ethanol. Is Vodka in there. So Johnny Depp takes a drag on a cigarette. And then as he's talking to Angela Jolie, he flicks the thing over and they've split second. This hits the pool. There's a flame. I like a 180 meters high because the ethanol ignites, it burns. Okay? If it's in water, there's a cigarette goes out. So this is bond energies. If it's a real stable compound, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, this has consequences.

Speaker 1:          29:56          Uh, okay. So the last thing I'll tell you is he is, this is the here, these are the bond energies I just told you for, for um, uh, methanol. This is the Oih bond. Uh, this is a ch bond. The weakest bond is the CEO bond. These are these numbers in k cal per mol. It's always interesting, uh, if you knew the bond, if you knew what these bond energies are, what are the bond energies for the radicals? So if I reach in and cut a bond here, and I make methoxy. Dot. If I make methoxy dot. Uh, now the bond energy here for the ch bond here, I can use the meter stick, the ch bond, which used to be 96 k Cal Promo drops to 22. You can see why the minute, the manner that you cut the bond here, the hydrogen Annaliese, but this dot couples with that dot.

Speaker 1:          30:47          And you got from Aldehyde nice stable compound. So, uh, and the, the, the CEO bond here is about 90 k cal Pomona. Is this about the same thing for it is for the, for the co bond in methanol, you go to the other bond, which is hydroxyzine methyl. You got to this species, uh, again, if you cut the bond off the Oih Bond, uh, you get a.here and the other dot. Then combines back here is formaldehyde. So now this is 30 k Caliper mall is to be contrasted with 106. What's interesting is the COO bond, which used to be 92 goes up. I don't know why, but it does. And not by a little bit. There's almost a volt, so, so, so there's all sorts of interesting patterns. You can have an in these bond energies and, and uh, you literally can have, um, uh, a, uh, uh, a, uh, uh, you, you can look at, at Donnelly, the, uh, these alcohols, but all sorts of alcohol peroxides and a variety of these things.

Speaker 1:          31:52          Uh, uh, okay. Uh, uh, here I'm going to finish early. You can see. All right. All right, so here there's a, another thing I want to show you and that is when you're talking about what a bond strength is, uh, um, uh, it turns out that an early way that people tried to measure bond strengths, we'd be that you'd consider a molecule like methane I need by big stick here and you take methane, uh, you can burn it and you can, uh, and you can actually measure the energy to take this apart to a carbon atom and four hydrogens. So he told you that, uh, that chuck got, uh, described you, how you would measure that, the energies of individual carbon atoms. You can actually work out that the bond that, that, that this is the break to break this to break all four bonds and methane, it's going to cost you a four 97.5 k cal per mall, the scissors for bonds and methane's.

Speaker 1:          32:49          You'd cross yourself think of Jesus and then just divide by four. And if you did that, that number divided by four is 99 k cal per mole. Okay, that's so you'd figured that must be sort of the average bond energy. If you go that these cycles, like I just told you, you can actually measure individually. The first bond is 104 point a 104.99 plus or minus 0.03 k cal per mol. Uh, and that's the first bond energy that gives you the absolute heat of formation of the methyl radical. You can now take a methyl radical and break and measure the second bond. Notice the bond energy goes up from 100 and 105 to 110 then it goes, the third one is 101 and the last one is 90 k. Cal promote these guys, give you individually the heats of formation of all of these species.

Speaker 1:          33:40          Notice that not a single one of these bond energies equals at average here. It's close. But, but, but the uncertainties are such that, that it's not quite. And so using these average bond energies, you gotta be careful. The other thing that I'll also tell you is if you actually take the sum of these numbers and add them up is three 97.5 it's exactly this. And uh, this is a testament to the guys who did these measurements. These are very hard experiments to do. And that means that each one of these four numbers is right because you know, this thing has to be right. The four of these guys have to add to these things. So here the, so some of these things is this, that means the first law of thermodynamics really works. So this is a very, this is, uh, this is, uh, this is a very interesting, uh, uh, set of experiments to do.

Speaker 1:          34:32          Okay. So here, uh, uh, uh, I'm going to give you people, okay. So I, I'm allowed to show my last little picture then. Okay. Here, uh, this is, I'm in Boulder, Colorado, and we're not as sophisticated as you people here are in new haven. So it turns out here, uh, here. So this is me. Caroline Berger is the best, is the captain and the negative ions, the smartest guy in the world about doing negative vines spectroscopy. A chuck, the Pew, uh, is here, is, is a Yale Phd is a member of the National Academy of Sciences. Uh, he's an organic chemist in boulder. Elvin Ferguson is inventor of the flowing after glow. Is that Noaa, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in Boulder. Uh, this is Steve Leonys who's have have, uh, one of the most famous chemical physicists in United States and is now at Berkeley. He was the head of the chemical dynamics beamline out there, cause then Ackerman is, was a postdoc here, uh, in the 1960s. Uh, and he's the, at the, uh, uh, Academy of Sciences in Prague. And this is, uh, uh, Ronnie Bierbaum, uh, who is the master of the, of negative on chemistry. So I've given you a bit about 10 minutes early, so I'm happy to answer any questions that you, people may have.

Speaker 2:          35:50          [inaudible] okay, I have one. Well, let's go back to, you hit a B blank blend. Okay. But I want to go back to them, the getting some weed, just for what it's worth. That's uh, whoa. Yeah. So now you go down and, okay, here we go. Square. He'd go up here to sure. Uh, that both that spectrum you show that had vibrational fifth estate here should be, that's right. Yes. There it is. Now, did people understand how this was working, right? That, that you put the laser energy and you measure how much of it, you mean you're measuring this difference, right? That's right. But sometimes some of the energy went into vibration of the molecule. So the energy that came out was, uh, to the extent that she went into the molecule, right? So here's here to say is when no vibrational energy goes this trek product, right? So that's how you know what the lowest. Now here's a peek here, right? So

Speaker 1:          37:23          that comes from the fact that you have a vibrationally excited negative vine. The, the negative iron, instead of being in his ground, vibrational state has a little bit of energy and it'll actually be in the COO stretch. He's where this'll be. So if there's any energy in that, in the negative ion, then to go back to why Diagram,

Speaker 2:          37:44          uh, I've got to go here.

Speaker 1:          37:49          If you have a little, if you have hot bands, in other words, if you have some of the, of the molecules are, have vibrational energy in this, then the mall, then, then the molecules aren't down here in vehicles to zero, but they're actually populated in higher states here. So that means that those electrons will take less kinetic energy to get off. And you can always spot them because they'll have a, a different frequency. Tha Tha tha

Speaker 2:          38:15          here,

Speaker 1:          38:20          this the frequency diff that you're going to have a set of frequencies here, which will be, uh, a mode in the neutral molecule. This is a method, the methoxy radical and this is that of the negative ion. And so this is a vibration in the negative on, and there'll be because the electrons are different in these things. So, uh, uh, you can guess when you get to a molecule which gets to be more complex, uh, uh, like fun, oxy radical, I talked to you about that for Nagase. Radical has a lot more Adams. So analyzing this steadily gets more and more difficult, but we like to do that. That's what God put us on this earth for.

Speaker 2:          39:00          Oh,

Speaker 1:          39:02          you can also guess is he showed you what I'm interested in right now in sugars. Cause I'm interested in how biomass decomposes you. Remember, we know what glucose looks like. Glucose is a molecule that has many different hydroxyl radicals. Hydroxyls on it and the hydroxyls are all slightly different. So now instead of making a negative vine, like in methoxy mean, how hard can this be? You only got one o h what happens? Who, yeah, ethylene glycol or if you now have you take glycerol, I think glycol has two hydroxyls. Glycerol has three. Uh, three oaks is going to have four. Ribosome is going to have five. So now you're going to have to begin to tell which, Ooh, this came from. So this is going to be a bitch, but it, but if you can do this, you would be able to take these molecules and you'll be able to break all the bonds in them in an order that she, in the order of this, you'd like to do it. And that's very interesting to do.

Speaker 2:          39:54          So you were very kind to speak about putting electrons into sigma star or bubbles. It's Alison is not a big fan of molecular orbitals.

Speaker 1:          40:10          Yes, that is true. Look, I do valence bond work. Is it your, this is a matter of taste. Uh, there's uh, different ways to view these things and, and uh, in the, in, in the end, the only thing that counts is what you measure it here. If, if you have a model that can cause it can account for what the, the patterns that you've measured and you can predict what the next um, uh, uh, values are going to be. You got to, you have you, you understand this and, but it's the data. Is that what survives? The rest of it is all a matter of opinion. He likes Sigma Star overalls. I don't,

Speaker 2:          40:55          okay. You were talking about, uh, the stability of the [inaudible] rabbit hole in terms of its resonance stabilization. Yes. So I think these people could help you out or at least point out something interesting though that uh, this radical is stable because you can draw resonance structures that have you like, okay. How about if you say that that did the, uh, starting on all that, that's the bond that you're going to right here. Right

Speaker 1:          41:34          here, I've got a pair of electrons. Yep. That I can draw a resonance structures and so on. So it looks to me like it's worth more here than it is. Listen, dream on big boy. How do I push this thing up? How do I push this? How do I get this thing up

Speaker 2:          42:00          here? Yeah,

Speaker 1:          42:17          sorry. Sorry. This electron, it's going to get d localized over the whole molecule. If you try to do this with an electron hair, what you're going to have is,

Speaker 2:          42:32          okay, so if I do that,

Speaker 1:          42:44          I, I'm pushing charges around. I don't like that. Okay. All right. Here. I don't like the fact that the oxygen's going to have starting to, you're, you're starting to suck electrons. All you're, you're starting to, as the electrons migrate down the, this, the oxygen oxygen's going to become possible, be charged. So, Jeez, I just would never do that. But, but here, but what, but what's true is that bond energy honestly gotten really and truly is 86 k cal per mole. That is a fact. And this is a, is a flippant way to, um, um, to, uh, to, uh, to have an, to have anticipated this contrast that we'll say,

Speaker 2:          43:28          oh,

Speaker 1:          43:31          methoxy. Dot. Where's that electron gun to go? It's, it's lily stapled to the oxygen in and there's nothing that can do. It can't, it can't go anywhere. So when you, uh, when you have them,

Speaker 2:          43:44          okay,

Speaker 1:          43:47          when you break that bond, you get hydrogen, Nana, you get the doc that just stuck right there. As you pull this bond off the.now, uh, is able to be the local ice and spread around the whole ring. And that's, and, and this bond energy then in in a funnel that this bond energy, and it's going to be 86 k cal per mall. They saying lets you measure the absolute he information

Speaker 2:          44:17          of two 98.

Speaker 1:          44:22          Oh, this thing that has this is this low bond energy is going to mean that this, the heat, this heat of formation is, is going to be low. So what, what that means is if we're trying to study Lignin, Lignin, Lignin or trees, okay. You know, the uh, uh, you take a chainsaw and you're cutting trees down there, that's very tough material. And these are these, all these compounds are, are, are, uh, long, uh, in three dimensional polymers of Aero Al Kill ethers. So if you know the heat of formation, foxy radical, um, this bond is turns out to be 62 K cal per mol. And if you do these in,

Speaker 2:          45:09          yeah,

Speaker 1:          45:09          this, it's like 90 and that's a volt and a half. So when you, when you heat this, these all these molecules break apart him. The first thing they do is they farm from oxy radicals. And this is if this triggers a decomposition of these things. So it turns that I don't like, I don't like these things that in the neutral molecule being delocalized because I think you have to separate charge and I don't like that

Speaker 2:          45:39          there are actually people back there are smart. That's kind of stuff. Do you guys find that? You know, I know, yeah. What's the case? It is a little bit verbal.

Speaker 1:          45:59          Oh indeed. Indeed. There is. If you, if you look at, if you look at the EPR spectrum of this radical, it is delocalized all over the place in here. I mean you're, you're an expert in this, you know about all these hyper find couplings and whatnot

Speaker 2:          46:14          from the, from the protons are out there. It's like an Emr. So after the electron spin gets out on these protons and it interacts with nucleus, even if a molecule is tumbling right, you don't have to worry about the anti for, yeah. So no doubt gets the local eyes. But why doesn't this one, so Barney says it's because he doesn't like the charge, doesn't like to separate charge and residents strategies. But that's not, is this cool on this law or what? Anybody got an idea?

Speaker 1:          46:47          Well here we, we, we say, what do you mean this is this cool ohms law, cool ohms law is what it is.

Speaker 2:          46:53          Okay. Okay, so here, so here if,

Speaker 1:          46:59          if you had, if you want to draw, if residents forums like this are important, then that means that that, I think as a consequence of this, you have to have charge separation. I think these are high energy residents forum. So if they're higher energy residence forms, they don't contribute to the super position of the wave function is the way I say that because I have a valence bond going. Okay. But, but what's true is, is Eddie six k cal per mole, nothing. Could be not about that. Okay.

Speaker 2:          47:27          Okay. I think we're good. Thank [inaudible].
