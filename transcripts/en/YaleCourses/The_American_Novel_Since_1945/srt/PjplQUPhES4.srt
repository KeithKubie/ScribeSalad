1
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:05,730
We finished black boy last time and one
of the big questions coming out of my

2
00:00:05,731 --> 00:00:10,731
discussion of that autobiography is how
do you manage the question of context

3
00:00:11,251 --> 00:00:15,750
and reading a novel, a or an
autobiography in reading any texts.

4
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:20,740
And we had a very complex publishing
history to think about, um,

5
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:22,110
with that text.

6
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:28,350
Flannery O'connor's work raises
questions of a similar kind,

7
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:32,010
but they look very
different. And so my, um,

8
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:34,230
my lectures on Flannery O'connor,

9
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:39,440
we'll highlight the methodologies that
we can bring to any reading of a novel,

10
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:40,980
um,

11
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:44,370
and it will highlight the differences
between different methodologies and what

12
00:00:44,371 --> 00:00:47,520
they allow us to see in a different texts.

13
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:50,633
Okay.

14
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:55,320
Flannery O'connor, as most of you
probably know, is a southern writer.

15
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:56,190
Um,

16
00:00:56,190 --> 00:01:00,720
she's very often assimilated to a whole
group of southern writers who were

17
00:01:00,721 --> 00:01:05,350
working in the 1930s and forties.
The southern Agrarians. Um,

18
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:09,120
she was friends with a lot of the
major figures of that movement,

19
00:01:09,121 --> 00:01:13,110
especially Allen Tate and,
um, Carolyn, uh, Gordon,

20
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:14,580
she,
uh,

21
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:19,500
lived out her life mostly in a small
town called Milledgeville, Georgia.

22
00:01:19,501 --> 00:01:22,680
She was born in Savannah in 1925.
Um,

23
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:25,650
she studied writing at the
Iowa writer's workshop.

24
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:30,480
She lived in New York for a short time,
but she was afflicted with Lupus,

25
00:01:30,481 --> 00:01:35,481
a very serious illness and she died at
the age of 39 and 1964 so she lived a

26
00:01:38,251 --> 00:01:41,580
pretty short life. Um, over
the course of that life,

27
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:45,510
she wrote mostly short stories and so
she's very much known for her short

28
00:01:45,511 --> 00:01:49,890
stories. Um, she has a couple
of novels of them. This is,

29
00:01:49,891 --> 00:01:51,870
I think the most successful,

30
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:53,263
uh,

31
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:56,521
oh Connor,

32
00:01:56,521 --> 00:02:01,290
you may also know has been
understood as a religious writer.

33
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:07,070
She was a Catholic and she very much
made her Catholicism at the center of all

34
00:02:10,591 --> 00:02:14,400
the things that she said
about her fictional practice.

35
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,600
And so we're going to see a couple
of those things. Uh, uh, today.

36
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:22,760
Let's look just to begin with,
if you brought your books, um,

37
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,290
well actually let's look
at the cover of this book.

38
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:30,840
What does this cover say to you?
What does this image remind you of?

39
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:35,700
What does it look like to you
want to answer that part?

40
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:41,040
It's the sacred heart. Yes. It's
the sacred heart of Jesus in,

41
00:02:41,041 --> 00:02:46,041
in Catholic iconography of a certain
kind of the figure of Christ is shown,

42
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:52,700
usually partying his clothes and his
flesh and showing you his sacred heart,

43
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:04,120
which is usually crowned
with flame and often,

44
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:08,590
um, encircled with thorns.
So it's an image of Christ,

45
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:10,960
the suffering Godhead,

46
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:16,590
the very human fleshly person who will
part his own flesh in order to connect

47
00:03:20,291 --> 00:03:24,820
with in order to redeem,
um, the, the believer.

48
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:31,120
So right in the packaging of
this novel that we have today,

49
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:35,770
this cover has changed over time.
Um, nevertheless, even today,

50
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:39,880
that very Catholic iconography is
right on the front of the cover.

51
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:44,650
And when you see why his blood,
that title right below the sacred heart,

52
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:48,070
you can't help but think of,
well,

53
00:03:48,071 --> 00:03:51,130
this is blood is somehow
the blood of Christ.

54
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:53,350
That's the kind of blood
we're talking about.

55
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:58,470
It's already entered a sort
of metaphorical register
religious register in the

56
00:03:58,481 --> 00:04:02,200
way this book is packaged.
Then when we open up the front,

57
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:09,150
we see the author's note to the second
edition and this was something O'Connor

58
00:04:10,121 --> 00:04:13,510
added to the novel, uh, in 1962.

59
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:16,330
I just want to read that with you today.

60
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:23,830
She says, why is blood has reached
the age of 10 and is still alive?

61
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:28,960
My critical powers are just sufficient
to determine this and I am gratified to

62
00:04:28,961 --> 00:04:29,890
be able to say it.

63
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:33,940
The book was written with Zest and if
possible it should be read that way.

64
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:39,360
It is a comic novel about a Christian
Mal Gray Louie and as such very serious

65
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:45,090
for all comic novels that are any good
must be about matters of life and death.

66
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:50,440
Wise blood was written by an author,
congenitally innocent of theory,

67
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:53,020
but one with certain preoccupations.

68
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:58,360
That belief in Christ is to some a matter
of life and death has been a stumbling

69
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:03,460
block for readers who would prefer to
think it a matter of no great consequence

70
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:04,653
for them.

71
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:09,990
Hazel motes integrity lies in his
trying with such vigor to get rid of the

72
00:05:10,391 --> 00:05:14,890
ragged figure who moves from tree
to tree in the back of his mind.

73
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:20,520
For the author Hazel's integrity
lies in his not being able to do so.

74
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:27,210
So right up front we are told that
Hazel motes is a Christian in spite of

75
00:05:29,351 --> 00:05:30,184
himself.

76
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:35,440
That this is how we are to understand
this character who we will come to know.

77
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:42,450
I also want to sort of give another layer
to this understanding of O'connor as a

78
00:05:44,321 --> 00:05:48,730
religious writer by looking at what she
said in her car respondence to one of

79
00:05:48,731 --> 00:05:51,370
her readers who asked her some questions.

80
00:05:51,371 --> 00:05:54,460
And this is on the handout
that I passed around.

81
00:05:57,170 --> 00:06:00,980
This is a letter to a man
named Ben Griffith from 1954.

82
00:06:00,981 --> 00:06:05,981
So she had just finished wise blood
and people are starting to read it,

83
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:10,480
ask her questions.
She was a prolific correspondence.

84
00:06:10,481 --> 00:06:12,500
She was very generous
in her letter writing.

85
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:15,860
She would write to almost
anyone who wrote to her.

86
00:06:15,861 --> 00:06:18,890
She would write back in a substantive way.
Um,

87
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:22,400
I think it's in part that
I'm suffering from Lupus.

88
00:06:22,401 --> 00:06:26,660
She was very much confined to her house
in Georgia and the letter writing,

89
00:06:26,661 --> 00:06:31,280
this kind of correspondence was certainly
way for her to keep in contact, um,

90
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:35,390
with the, with the world of readers
and, and other writers and friends.

91
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:41,650
So he had written to her, um, he
was teaching writing at a local, uh,

92
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:42,603
college.

93
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:49,400
He's obviously been asking her about
the sources of some of the images and

94
00:06:49,401 --> 00:06:53,810
characters and themes in wise blood.
So I want to point out a couple of things.

95
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,510
This is the first full paragraph.

96
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:02,980
I don't know how to cure the sore situs
except to tell you that I can discover a

97
00:07:03,321 --> 00:07:06,620
good many possible sources
myself for wise blood.

98
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:10,070
But I am often embarrassed to
find that I read the sources,

99
00:07:10,071 --> 00:07:12,590
I read the sources after
I had written the book.

100
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:16,400
I have been exposed to
Wordsworth's intimation owed.

101
00:07:16,401 --> 00:07:17,900
But that is all I can say about it.

102
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:22,160
I have one of those food chopper brains
that nothing comes out of the way it

103
00:07:22,161 --> 00:07:26,570
went in. The Oedipus business comes
nearer to home. Of course, haze.

104
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:28,760
Motes is not an Oedipus figure,

105
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:33,710
but there are obvious resemblances at
the time I was writing the last of the

106
00:07:33,711 --> 00:07:38,400
book, I was living in Connecticut,
actually very close here at Yale and uh,

107
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:42,740
one of the, uh, people who is
still at Yale, Penny Laurans,

108
00:07:42,741 --> 00:07:46,470
I don't know if you've met her,
she's someone who, who knew, uh,

109
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:50,600
she was married to Robert Fitzgerald
and she knew Flannery O'connor. Um,

110
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:54,980
uh, when I was living in Connecticut
with the Robert Fitzgerald's,

111
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:59,000
Robert Fitzgerald translated the Fiba
and cycle and cycle with Dudley fits in

112
00:07:59,001 --> 00:08:02,870
the translation of Oedipus rex had just
come out and I was much taken with it.

113
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:08,360
Um, anyway, all I can say is I did
a lot of thinking about Oedipus.

114
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:14,050
This is very typical in tone for O'connor
when she talks about education or

115
00:08:14,871 --> 00:08:18,380
learning. And if you read
more in this letter, I won't
go through the whole thing.

116
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:21,890
Um, you will see that she's
very self deprecating.

117
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:26,690
She says she has what passes for
an education in this day and age.

118
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:31,370
She says that she's read a little bit of
Kafka and doesn't know what to make of

119
00:08:31,371 --> 00:08:33,140
him,
but it makes you a bolder writer.

120
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:36,710
She reads a little Henry James Cause she
thinks that makes her a better writer

121
00:08:36,711 --> 00:08:38,600
somehow,
but she doesn't quite know how.

122
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:43,810
There's always this veneer of innocence
or lack of learning or lack of

123
00:08:45,171 --> 00:08:47,420
sophistication.
Um,

124
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:52,610
so she's presenting
herself as a simple person.

125
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:54,650
I think that's important,

126
00:08:55,110 --> 00:09:00,110
although not directly connected to her
presentation of herself as a Catholic

127
00:09:00,361 --> 00:09:01,194
person.

128
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:06,500
I think it does factor into her sense
that the truth she is accessing or the

129
00:09:07,591 --> 00:09:12,591
truth that she is trying to present to
the world in her stories is one that uh,

130
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:19,530
even a child might be able to understand
that that fits very comfortably within

131
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:23,610
a new testament understanding
of the teaching of Christ.

132
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:29,220
So Christ is that one to whom
the little children can come.

133
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:32,400
And I think she cultivates that,
uh,

134
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:35,190
that childlike sense in
herself presentation.

135
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:40,200
But then there's this very explicit
discussion of her Catholicism.

136
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:46,590
Little further down my background and
my inclinations are both Catholic and I

137
00:09:47,431 --> 00:09:49,320
think this is very apparent in the book.

138
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:53,100
Something is usually said about
Kafka in connection with wise blood,

139
00:09:53,101 --> 00:09:56,670
but I've never succeeded in making my
way through the castle or the trial and I

140
00:09:56,671 --> 00:09:58,680
wouldn't pretend to know
anything about Kafka.

141
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:02,430
I think reading a little of him perhaps
makes you a boulder writer and so on.

142
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,410
If you turn over, this is another, um,

143
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:11,490
this is another letter to Ben Griffith.
Um,

144
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:14,820
written fairly shortly
after this first one.

145
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:19,020
She expands a little bit on
this sense of her Catholicism.

146
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,990
This is in the middle of the page.

147
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:27,950
Let me assure you that no one but a
Catholic could've written wise blood even

148
00:10:28,561 --> 00:10:31,620
though it is a book about
a kind of Protestant St,

149
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:36,870
it reduces Protestantism to the twin
ultimate absurdities of the church without

150
00:10:36,871 --> 00:10:41,670
Christ or the Holy Church of Christ
without Christ, which no po Protestant,

151
00:10:41,671 --> 00:10:44,940
pious, pious Protestant
would do. And of course,

152
00:10:44,941 --> 00:10:49,500
no unbeliever or agnostic could have
written it because it is entirely

153
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,900
redemption centered in thought.

154
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:56,070
Not Too many people are willing to
see this and perhaps it is hard to see

155
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:59,220
because Hazel motes is
such an admirable nihilist.

156
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:03,240
His nihilism leads him back to the
fact of his redemption, however,

157
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:06,510
which is what he would have
liked so much to get away from.

158
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:12,690
When you start describing the significance
of a symbol like the tunnel which

159
00:11:12,691 --> 00:11:16,290
recurs in the book, you immediately
begin to limit it and assemble,

160
00:11:16,291 --> 00:11:20,160
should go on deepening everything
should have a wider significance.

161
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:24,300
But I am a novelist, not a critic,
and I can excuse myself from x Xsplit,

162
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:28,980
Casio xsplit on to text on that ground.
The real reason of course,

163
00:11:28,981 --> 00:11:33,150
is laziness. There's that, that,
uh, characteristics self-deprecation

164
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:39,120
with letters like this,
which were published,

165
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:42,270
uh,
copiously in a,

166
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:46,890
in a beautiful addition that
Sarah Sally Fitzgerald edited, um,

167
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:49,080
with letters like this,

168
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:53,770
her frequent essays and lectures which
are collected in a book called mystery

169
00:11:53,771 --> 00:11:54,604
and manners.

170
00:11:55,030 --> 00:12:00,030
She was expounding a certain reading
of her fiction even while she was still

171
00:12:00,731 --> 00:12:01,564
writing it.

172
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:06,460
And those who were close
to her have picked up that
understanding of her fiction

173
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:07,960
and promulgated it.

174
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:13,030
And there's a huge critical
industry around Flannery O'Connor.

175
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:18,330
And at the core of it is a body of
criticism that fines and articulate and

176
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:26,200
explains the religious
meanings of her texts.

177
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:29,260
With that in mind,

178
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:34,780
I want to point up to the two quotations
that I put on the board to start us off

179
00:12:34,781 --> 00:12:39,280
today. Um, I like his eyes.

180
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:44,950
They don't look like they see what he's
looking at, but they keep on looking.

181
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:49,050
This is Sabbath, Lily Hawks and then, uh,

182
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:53,140
a character you haven't met yet.
If you stopped at page 100 Ani j holy,

183
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:58,360
I wouldn't have you believe nothing.
You can't feel in your own hearts.

184
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:04,980
These two quotations seem to me a kind
of rubric under which we can start to

185
00:13:05,591 --> 00:13:10,591
think about what it means to read this
novel and what it means to read it in the

186
00:13:12,701 --> 00:13:17,701
light of the religious
context that O'connor herself,

187
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:22,540
critics,
marketers have built up around her work.

188
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:27,100
The first quotation from
Sabbath Lilly of course,

189
00:13:27,101 --> 00:13:29,930
focuses on the eyes and it,

190
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:34,630
it is not hard to read into haze,
motes,

191
00:13:34,631 --> 00:13:35,680
his name,

192
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:41,560
that the trope of site is going
to be important haze motes.

193
00:13:41,561 --> 00:13:46,270
There's that famous passage in the
new testament or is it, oh gosh,

194
00:13:46,271 --> 00:13:50,020
now I'm going to forget if it's new or Old
Testament, someone will correct me. Um,

195
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:54,400
uh, do not try to remove the
moat from your neighbor's eye,

196
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:58,630
uh, before you have removed
it from your own or less.

197
00:13:58,631 --> 00:14:01,150
You failed to remove the
moat from your own eye.

198
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:07,200
So there's this sense of
occluded site haze that Hayes,

199
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:12,280
somehow something is wrong with haze,

200
00:14:12,281 --> 00:14:13,630
motes his eyes,

201
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:19,470
something wrong with his site or rather
there is something important about his

202
00:14:19,481 --> 00:14:21,880
site that we're going to have to unpack.

203
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:26,950
But what I want to take out of Sabbath,

204
00:14:26,951 --> 00:14:31,951
Lily's comment about Hays is
this sense of what you look at.

205
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:38,710
What does Hayes look at
and what does he see,

206
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:43,870
what do we look at when we read
this novel and what do we see?

207
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:48,040
Those are questions that are going to
frame the two lectures that I give on this

208
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:48,874
novel.

209
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:53,480
The second quotation from Ani j holy
raises the question of sentiment.

210
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:58,670
This novel as you will soon see once
you get to the parts where Ani j holy

211
00:14:58,671 --> 00:15:03,671
begins to preach this novel is very
much a critique of sentimentality.

212
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:10,030
If Richard Wright's ideal response to
his fiction was that for the reader,

213
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:15,820
the words would disappear and all they
would be left with is their emotional

214
00:15:16,191 --> 00:15:19,460
response.
For O'Connor,

215
00:15:19,461 --> 00:15:24,461
it's precisely that kind of
response to any call be a textual,

216
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:30,920
be it an active reading and active
audition. Hearing someone preach.

217
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:36,310
That kind of response is precisely
not the one you are supposed to have.

218
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:43,840
And so I would ask you to think about a
couple of simple questions as you move

219
00:15:44,661 --> 00:15:48,800
through this book. And as you think
about what I have to say about it, um,

220
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:52,130
one of them could begin
with a reflection like this.

221
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:56,450
Would you ever want to sit down to dinner
with any of the people in this novel?

222
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:03,710
I see people shaking their heads,
they are quite unlikable

223
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:10,340
and this is consistent pretty much
across O'Connor's fiction, short, long,

224
00:16:10,341 --> 00:16:11,270
medium,
whatever.

225
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:15,650
Her characters are not very endearing.

226
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:18,550
So you want to ask yourself why that's,

227
00:16:18,551 --> 00:16:23,551
so this is a conscious decision on her
part and you want to think about that

228
00:16:24,381 --> 00:16:29,300
decision. If there's any character
who seems kind of endearing, uh,

229
00:16:29,301 --> 00:16:32,190
at least for me it's probably Enoch.
Um,

230
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:35,690
and we'll talk a little
bit more about him. Um,

231
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:39,320
not today but in the second
lecture and in section.

232
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,070
So with these questions in mind,

233
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:48,260
I want you to think about
how we can see the novel

234
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:54,880
and how we can think about it in the
face of the interpretation that's already

235
00:16:56,391 --> 00:16:57,410
layered onto it.

236
00:16:57,770 --> 00:17:02,770
And what I want to do is now kind of
just descend into the text and read with

237
00:17:05,511 --> 00:17:10,511
you the passage when Hays first
takes the Essex out for a spin,

238
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:17,120
his, his wonderful car, the Essex. Um,

239
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:20,420
so this is on page 73 is
about where it begins.

240
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:27,010
And I'm going to read through the next
two or three pages and I'll skip around

241
00:17:28,191 --> 00:17:32,120
in the book as things come up that I want
to show you in other parts of the book.

242
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:38,440
So let's think about seeing and theology
and all the issues that are already on

243
00:17:41,331 --> 00:17:44,960
the table for us.
I'm going to begin at the bottom of 73

244
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:49,290
when the car was ready, if you have
your book, go ahead and open it up.

245
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,120
When the car was ready,

246
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:54,960
the man and the boy stood by
to watch him drive it off.

247
00:17:55,790 --> 00:18:00,360
Is it the wrong page
numbers? Shoot. Oh dear.

248
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,640
69 okay,
so it's four off.

249
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:04,750
Okay.

250
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,040
Thank you for telling me.

251
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,950
You rely on publishers and
then they let you tell them.

252
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:17,030
Okay. Does everyone, everyone
have it? When the car was ready,

253
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:20,300
the man and the boys stood
by to watch him drive it off.

254
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:24,980
He didn't want anybody watching him
because he hadn't driven a car in four or

255
00:18:24,981 --> 00:18:28,790
five years. The man in the boy didn't
say anything while he tried to start it.

256
00:18:28,791 --> 00:18:31,100
They only stood there looking in at him.

257
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,350
I wanted this car mostly to be a
house for me. He said to the man,

258
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:41,780
I ain't got any place to be.
You ain't took the break off yet.

259
00:18:41,810 --> 00:18:44,000
The man said he took the
break off in the car,

260
00:18:44,001 --> 00:18:48,380
shot backwards because the man had
left it in reverse in a second.

261
00:18:48,381 --> 00:18:50,060
He got it going forward and drove off.

262
00:18:50,061 --> 00:18:54,170
Crookedly pass the man and boys
still standing there watching.

263
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:59,210
He kept going forward
thinking nothing and sweating.

264
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:02,300
So I'm going to stop there for a minute.

265
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:08,120
Haze sees the car as a kind of home.
Well,

266
00:19:08,121 --> 00:19:11,120
how are we meant to understand
the meaning of that?

267
00:19:11,121 --> 00:19:16,121
It has the feeling of a rare
moment of explanation from Hayes.

268
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:21,140
He almost never explains
himself to other people.

269
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:27,500
Here he is accounting
for his need for the car.

270
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:33,170
Now of course,
O'connor was very good at

271
00:19:34,850 --> 00:19:39,850
imbuing her writing with repeated symbols
that grow and accrue meaning across

272
00:19:42,441 --> 00:19:43,274
the text.

273
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:48,310
So we've already seen the trope of the
house and if you look back at 24 oh now

274
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:55,370
it's tried 20 see if we can find it here.

275
00:19:58,830 --> 00:19:59,700
When Hays

276
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:06,350
describes or we sort of know through his
consciousness the story of his time in

277
00:20:07,171 --> 00:20:08,004
the army,

278
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:13,470
this is what we learn
about how he felt there.

279
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,290
After he's wounded,

280
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:22,070
he had all the time he could want to
study his soul in and assure himself that

281
00:20:22,951 --> 00:20:27,150
it was not there.
When he was thoroughly convinced,

282
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:30,750
he saw that this was
something he had always known.

283
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:35,100
The misery he had was a longing for home.

284
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:37,890
It had nothing to do with Jesus.

285
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:40,710
When the army finally let him go,

286
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:44,640
he was pleased to think that
he was still uncorrupted.

287
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:48,160
All he wanted was to get back to Rod,
Tennessee,

288
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:51,610
the Black Bible and his mother's glasses.

289
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:56,140
We're still in the bottom of his duffle
bag. He didn't read any book now,

290
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:59,500
but he kept the Bible because
it had come from home.

291
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:04,510
He kept the glasses in case his
vision should ever become dim.

292
00:21:05,310 --> 00:21:06,143
Okay.

293
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:08,780
Oh,

294
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:13,780
Connor has already put in place in
the novel through that little passage,

295
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:18,450
the sense that the longing for home

296
00:21:20,370 --> 00:21:25,370
and the longing for redemption
or the resistance to redemption,

297
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:29,400
these things are very
close to one another.

298
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:34,380
You can mistake here we,
we find out about Hayes.

299
00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:39,770
You can mistake the longing for Jesus
for the longing for home or vice versa.

300
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:44,220
The longing for home for
the long name of Jesus.

301
00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:50,630
The Bible that he carries
around is important to him
because it comes from home.

302
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:57,350
I want to suggest to you that the fact
that it's the religious book for him,

303
00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:01,860
for his culture,
for his family,

304
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:08,010
is not of course incidental to the fact
that it's what reminds him of home.

305
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:13,530
It's not just that you can
mistake the longing for, for home,

306
00:22:13,531 --> 00:22:15,030
for the longing for Jesus.

307
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:21,320
You can in some ways see
religion and home as conflated,

308
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:27,110
and this gets to a sort of traditional
Christian notion of the believer as not

309
00:22:27,571 --> 00:22:29,430
being at home in the world,

310
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:34,850
that the believers somehow belongs to
God's kingdom and that this is either

311
00:22:35,970 --> 00:22:40,970
countercultural at odds with the general
world in which he or she would find

312
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:47,120
herself or it is totally incompatible
with the world in which we live.

313
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:51,873
Okay.

314
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:57,040
The Bible is a physical manifestation of
the proximity of the spiritual and the

315
00:22:58,821 --> 00:23:00,680
material in this world.

316
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:06,580
So what makes him feel close to home in
a way has to make him feel close to the

317
00:23:09,471 --> 00:23:11,360
religion he's trying to reject.

318
00:23:12,170 --> 00:23:17,170
That conflation is part of what makes
it impossible for Hays to escape the

319
00:23:18,321 --> 00:23:19,850
question of redemption.

320
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:24,920
Even if he wants to answer it in a way
that's at odds with how, for example,

321
00:23:24,921 --> 00:23:27,620
his grandfather,
the preacher would answer it.

322
00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:33,440
This is why he's continually mistaken
for a preacher. No matter what he does.

323
00:23:33,441 --> 00:23:36,890
Remember he goes into the, into
the prostitute's house, Mrs. Watts,

324
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:40,070
and he's got a hat on and the hat
just makes him look like a preacher.

325
00:23:40,071 --> 00:23:42,590
There's nothing he can do. He says,
I'm not a preacher. And he says,

326
00:23:42,770 --> 00:23:44,840
that's okay if you will,
if you're not a preacher.

327
00:23:46,850 --> 00:23:50,870
It's just something that's in his body.

328
00:23:51,410 --> 00:23:55,670
It's physical.
So the car,

329
00:23:55,820 --> 00:24:00,770
going back to the passage I was
talking about before with the Essex,

330
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:05,960
the car, even though religion is
not mentioned directly right here,

331
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:11,110
the sense of home that it embodies
carries with it all that sense of unhoused

332
00:24:11,511 --> 00:24:13,850
newness.
And because it's a moving house,

333
00:24:15,770 --> 00:24:20,240
it carries the sense of the
wandering believer with it as well.

334
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:25,970
And you get that reinforced
on the very next page.

335
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:29,420
If you just, um, skip over
about a page from there,

336
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:36,050
a black pickup truck turned off a side
rose at road in front of him on the back

337
00:24:36,051 --> 00:24:36,500
of it,

338
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:41,500
an iron bed and a chair and table were
tied and on top of them a crate of Barb

339
00:24:42,681 --> 00:24:47,180
rock chickens. So other cars
on the road look like houses,

340
00:24:47,210 --> 00:24:48,530
mobile houses as well.

341
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:52,760
It's not just Hayes's Essex
that is imagined as home.

342
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:58,130
So O'Connor is giving us a version of
the road and I want you to keep this in

343
00:24:58,131 --> 00:25:02,450
mind because of course we're going to
read on the road and we're going to see a

344
00:25:02,451 --> 00:25:07,190
major road trip in Lolita,
actually two of them. So the,

345
00:25:07,191 --> 00:25:11,630
the iconography of the American road is
something that is going to come back to

346
00:25:11,631 --> 00:25:13,790
us.
Well here's our first example.

347
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:19,660
This is the road of the unhoused of the
spiritually seeking of the wandering of

348
00:25:21,801 --> 00:25:22,700
the last.

349
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:27,560
People wander in search of
some kind of coherent meaning

350
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:36,250
what to now move down a little bit and
observe how landscape is presented to us.

351
00:25:42,170 --> 00:25:45,200
This is after that,
since he was going very fast,

352
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:50,240
the highway was ragged with filling
stations and trailer camps and roadhouses.

353
00:25:50,870 --> 00:25:55,040
After awhile there were stretches where
red gullies dropped off on either side

354
00:25:55,041 --> 00:25:59,000
of the road and behind them there were
patches of field button together with six,

355
00:25:59,001 --> 00:26:03,590
six, six posts. The Sky
leaked all over, all of it.

356
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:08,030
And then it began to leak into the car.
The head of a string of pigs appeared,

357
00:26:08,031 --> 00:26:12,470
snowed up over the ditch and he had to
screeched to a stop and watch the rear of

358
00:26:12,471 --> 00:26:15,860
the last pig disappears,
shaking into the ditch on the other side.

359
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,890
He started the car again and went on.

360
00:26:19,130 --> 00:26:24,130
He had the feeling that everything he
saw was a broken off piece of some giant

361
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:28,400
blank thing he had forgotten
had happened to him.

362
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:30,953
Yeah.

363
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:34,570
So what do we notice about this landscape?
First of all,

364
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:36,880
it's very much constructed.

365
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:42,130
It's buttoned together with
posts as if someone had built it.

366
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:45,660
And what's more, these are
described as six, six, six posts.

367
00:26:45,661 --> 00:26:49,290
I think this is a probably
a size of lumber. Um,

368
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:52,650
but you can't get away from the,
uh,

369
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:55,470
the mythology of that number
in the book of revelation.

370
00:26:55,471 --> 00:26:58,800
It's the number of the beast.
It's the number of the devil.

371
00:26:59,490 --> 00:27:03,870
It's also a landscape
that is full of pigs,

372
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:05,430
wandering pigs.

373
00:27:05,670 --> 00:27:09,330
So if the people are
wandering through this road,

374
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:13,830
the pigs are equally wanderers,
um, throughout these fields.

375
00:27:13,831 --> 00:27:18,540
They're unconfined they seem
to cross the road at will.

376
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:21,100
Yeah.

377
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:22,270
The Sky,

378
00:27:23,830 --> 00:27:28,150
the world above is really
bound up with the world below.

379
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:30,040
There's very little separation.

380
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:35,070
Even if there is a sense that the sky
is impinging on the earth and not the

381
00:27:35,261 --> 00:27:40,180
other way around,
the sky leaked over all of it.

382
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:44,950
It's really in a sense, the physical
images of rain. It's raining,

383
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:49,180
so it's leaking all over it. But there's
more than that. There's this sense of,

384
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:53,620
um, the concerns of the sky.
Somehow the concerns of the above,

385
00:27:53,770 --> 00:27:58,770
the concerns of the transcendent are
seeping their way into the concerns of the

386
00:28:00,281 --> 00:28:01,720
material world below.

387
00:28:03,190 --> 00:28:08,190
And then you get that sort of
lyrical moment of interpretation.

388
00:28:09,550 --> 00:28:14,320
He had the feeling that everything he
saw was a broken off piece of some giant

389
00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:17,830
blank thing he had forgotten
had happened to him.

390
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:23,940
Now this is where the omniscient narrator
comes in quite forcefully and gives us

391
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:31,080
something to work on as we analyze
Hayes and we think about who he is as a

392
00:28:31,271 --> 00:28:33,700
character and where he finds himself.

393
00:28:34,030 --> 00:28:39,030
This connects I think with a whole host
of other passages that have to do with

394
00:28:39,101 --> 00:28:39,821
nothingness.

395
00:28:39,821 --> 00:28:43,960
And one of them is right above on that
page and I read it a little earlier

396
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:49,070
thinking nothing and sweating.
It's as if thinking nothing.

397
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:52,790
It's not a passive
activity but an active one.

398
00:28:54,050 --> 00:28:57,800
So that to think nothing is
something you have to work at.

399
00:28:58,190 --> 00:29:02,930
It's something that you can be
preoccupied with. And similarly,

400
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:08,480
if you look back, um,
at 37, this is again,

401
00:29:09,010 --> 00:29:11,660
uh,
a description of landscape.

402
00:29:12,110 --> 00:29:17,110
You can see this connection between
or well as somewhat of a disconnection

403
00:29:19,311 --> 00:29:22,700
between the above and the below.
Another description of sky,

404
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:28,760
this is Hazel.
I'm walking in talking to him.

405
00:29:29,270 --> 00:29:33,230
The black sky was underpinned
with long silver streaks.

406
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:36,800
This is the very beginning of chapter
three for trying to find it that looked

407
00:29:36,801 --> 00:29:41,801
like scaffolding and depth on depth behind
it were thousands stars that all seem

408
00:29:43,001 --> 00:29:48,001
to be moving very slowly as if they were
about some vast construction work that

409
00:29:48,341 --> 00:29:53,341
involved the whole order of the universe
and would take all time to complete.

410
00:29:54,130 --> 00:29:57,790
No one was paying any attention to the sky

411
00:29:59,770 --> 00:30:00,071
here.

412
00:30:00,071 --> 00:30:05,071
That omniscient narrator as when that
narrator looks into Hayes's mind offers

413
00:30:07,541 --> 00:30:12,490
you a reading of the sky
and it's separation from
the minds of the characters

414
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:17,710
that suggests or makes you
look for kinds of structure.

415
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:22,210
Here it's the construction work.

416
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:25,150
She actually uses that word,
but you get scaffolding.

417
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:29,290
You get depth or perspective counting.

418
00:30:29,291 --> 00:30:34,291
Thousands of stars moving as if they were
about some vast work that involve the

419
00:30:34,901 --> 00:30:37,810
whole order of the universe.
It volts,

420
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:40,840
the very concrete materiality,

421
00:30:40,841 --> 00:30:44,020
the physicality of these
characters in their circumstances.

422
00:30:44,290 --> 00:30:49,290
It vaults that discussion into a much
larger metaphysical transcendent context.

423
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:51,610
The whole order of the universe.

424
00:30:52,390 --> 00:30:57,390
It's moments like these when that
omniscient narrator lives up to its name,

425
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:02,530
that sense of omniscience that
we might associate with God.

426
00:31:03,130 --> 00:31:07,180
Another example is that the
very opening of the book,

427
00:31:09,430 --> 00:31:13,180
the train was racing through tree tops
that fell away at intervals and showed

428
00:31:13,181 --> 00:31:17,860
the son's standing very red on the edge
of the farthest woods near the plowed

429
00:31:17,861 --> 00:31:18,311
fields,

430
00:31:18,311 --> 00:31:23,260
curved and faded and a few and the few
hogs nosing in the furrows looked like

431
00:31:23,261 --> 00:31:24,910
large spotted stones.

432
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:29,530
Mrs Wally be Hitchcock who was facing
moats in the section said that she thought

433
00:31:29,531 --> 00:31:33,310
the early evening like this was the
prettiest time of day and she asked him if

434
00:31:33,311 --> 00:31:34,031
he didn't think so.

435
00:31:34,031 --> 00:31:38,560
Too pretty is not exactly
the word that comes to mind,

436
00:31:38,561 --> 00:31:40,720
at least not to my mind when I read this.

437
00:31:40,870 --> 00:31:45,400
It's more like heavy or
saturated and there's again,

438
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:48,580
pigs running around.
Again,

439
00:31:48,581 --> 00:31:53,581
there's a biblical iconography
behind this that uh,

440
00:31:54,430 --> 00:31:57,910
there are two instances
that come to my mind. Um,

441
00:31:58,390 --> 00:32:03,390
when demons are cast out by the apostles
and sent into a herd of pigs and the

442
00:32:03,971 --> 00:32:07,810
pigs go running off a cliff and die,
that's one image.

443
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,910
Another is the um,

444
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:13,810
the admonition not to throw
your pearls before swine,

445
00:32:13,811 --> 00:32:18,160
not to preach to those who can't
hear or won't be perceptive.

446
00:32:19,510 --> 00:32:24,510
So these moments of landscape description
offer up that consistently Christian

447
00:32:26,981 --> 00:32:30,190
inflected theory of the universe,

448
00:32:30,850 --> 00:32:33,760
that sense of transcendence as structure,

449
00:32:34,210 --> 00:32:38,530
as something that's moving inexorably
that we'll take all time to complete.

450
00:32:38,531 --> 00:32:40,760
It has a,
it has a teleology,

451
00:32:41,450 --> 00:32:44,330
so that's present in all of these moments.

452
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:49,340
But equally present, I want to get
back to this sense of blankness.

453
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:55,840
There's a vagueness to this language
that I think is quite calculated and it

454
00:32:57,771 --> 00:33:02,771
relates in Hayes's case to
his determination to not
be converted to evil but to

455
00:33:07,371 --> 00:33:09,770
nothing.
When he's in the army,

456
00:33:09,771 --> 00:33:14,771
he says he decides he can get rid
of Jesus by converting not evil,

457
00:33:15,981 --> 00:33:19,580
but to but to nothing,
to believe in nothing.

458
00:33:22,090 --> 00:33:27,090
So what O'Connor does is she presents a
sense of the world imbued with structure

459
00:33:28,810 --> 00:33:33,430
and meaning, but a structure and
meaning that looks essentially blank.

460
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:38,680
And I think the task of the novel
is to fill that structure in.

461
00:33:42,170 --> 00:33:42,590
Yeah.

462
00:33:42,590 --> 00:33:46,700
The last thing I want to point out in
this passage from here to the end of the

463
00:33:46,701 --> 00:33:51,701
chapter is the way that
Hayes's senses are described.

464
00:33:52,610 --> 00:33:56,300
We already talked a little bit about
his name and the occlusion of sight.

465
00:33:57,290 --> 00:34:00,020
The trope of site is
obviously extremely important.

466
00:34:00,021 --> 00:34:04,670
Here we have the blind preacher. Um, there
are more things which I won't reveal.

467
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:08,150
Uh, that happened at the end of the novel
to do with this. If you haven't read,

468
00:34:08,151 --> 00:34:09,320
I won't give it away,

469
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:13,730
but here there are simpler examples.

470
00:34:15,170 --> 00:34:19,490
When the truck pulls up in front of
haze and starts moving very slowly,

471
00:34:19,910 --> 00:34:24,910
he's started pounding his horn and he
had hit it three times before he realized

472
00:34:26,270 --> 00:34:27,890
it didn't make any sound.

473
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:35,080
He keeps doing this.
When he comes to the roadside sign,

474
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:39,420
woe to the blast femur and
whoremonger we'll hell swallow you up.

475
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:44,850
Says the pickup truck slowed even more
as if it were reading. The sign in.

476
00:34:44,851 --> 00:34:49,260
Hayes pounded his empty horn.
He beat on it and beat on it,

477
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:51,420
but it didn't make any sound.

478
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:54,450
He

479
00:34:54,450 --> 00:34:59,270
doesn't at first hear
the horn fail to blow.

480
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:01,430
Yeah.

481
00:35:01,430 --> 00:35:05,630
And then later when a car pull,

482
00:35:05,650 --> 00:35:10,250
a truck pulls up behind him,
he fails to hear a horn that does blow.

483
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:14,180
He was looking at the sign and he
didn't hear the horn. An oil truck,

484
00:35:14,210 --> 00:35:17,150
as long as the railroad car
was behind him in a second,

485
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:19,790
a red square face was at his car window.

486
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:23,180
It watched the back of his
neck and hat for a minute,

487
00:35:23,181 --> 00:35:25,670
and then a hand came in
and sat on his shoulder.

488
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:31,780
The driver's expression in his hand
stayed exactly the way they were,

489
00:35:31,781 --> 00:35:33,550
as if he didn't hear very well.

490
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:39,000
These two characters are as if
there is a a wall between them,

491
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:43,140
a wall of foam.
They can't hear each other.

492
00:35:43,770 --> 00:35:48,420
They're insulated from understanding
what the other is preoccupied with.

493
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:50,400
In Hayes's case,

494
00:35:51,210 --> 00:35:54,690
he does this over and over and over again,

495
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:59,700
and the most pitiful
example of it is on 57.

496
00:36:00,330 --> 00:36:05,310
Poor Ethan Hawke feel so bad for
him in this. In this passage,

497
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:12,030
Enoch is trying to hang out with Hayes.
Um,

498
00:36:12,031 --> 00:36:14,790
this is on the bottom
of 56 probably your 52

499
00:36:18,670 --> 00:36:21,460
he's trying to get, he's just
trying to get rid of Enoch. Listen,

500
00:36:21,461 --> 00:36:25,090
Hayes said roughly. I got business
of my own. I seen all of you I want,

501
00:36:25,270 --> 00:36:29,050
he began walking very fast in our,
kept skipping steps to keep up.

502
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:32,080
I've been here two months. He
said, and I don't know, and nobody,

503
00:36:32,081 --> 00:36:35,500
people ain't friendly here. I got me a
room and there ain't never nobody in it,

504
00:36:35,501 --> 00:36:39,730
but me. My Daddy said I had to come. I
would never have come, but he made me,

505
00:36:39,850 --> 00:36:43,720
I think I seen you summers before. You
ain't from Stockwell our, you know.

506
00:36:43,970 --> 00:36:48,370
Millsy no saw mill set.
They're set up there once,

507
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:52,030
you know at said look like you
had kind of a familiar face.

508
00:36:52,390 --> 00:36:55,720
They walked on without saying anything
until they got to the main street again.

509
00:36:55,870 --> 00:36:59,770
It was almost deserted. Goodbye Hayes
said, I'm going this way to, you know,

510
00:36:59,771 --> 00:37:02,080
at sadness in salon voice on the left.

511
00:37:02,081 --> 00:37:06,220
There was a movie house with the electric
bill was being changed and then I'm

512
00:37:06,221 --> 00:37:09,190
going to skip down. My daddy made
me come. He said in a crack voice.

513
00:37:09,191 --> 00:37:13,990
Hayes looked at him and saw he was crying.
His face seemed and wet and purple,

514
00:37:14,130 --> 00:37:18,900
purple, pink color. I ain't but 18
years old. He cried and he made me calm.

515
00:37:18,910 --> 00:37:20,740
And I don't know nobody.
Nobody here,

516
00:37:20,741 --> 00:37:23,500
I'll have nothing to do with
nobody else name friendly.

517
00:37:23,650 --> 00:37:25,870
He done gone off with a
woman and made me come,

518
00:37:25,871 --> 00:37:28,870
but she ain't gonna stay for
long. Okay. And so on and so on.

519
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:34,340
Poor EasyKnock. Does Hayes
Care? No, not at all.

520
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:39,890
He's looked straight ahead
with his face set. Poor Enoch.

521
00:37:40,310 --> 00:37:45,310
Nothing can penetrate Hayes's
imperviousness to other human beings.

522
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:50,150
If Hayes is busy looking at something,

523
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:57,100
what he's looking at is manifestly
not the person in front of him.

524
00:37:58,730 --> 00:38:03,500
He can't hear major
elements of the soundscape.

525
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:08,930
The car horn behind the truck horn
behind him. He can't hear his own horn.

526
00:38:08,931 --> 00:38:12,980
Whether it blows or not,
he can't hear the voices of other people.

527
00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:17,870
What he sees is a mystery as Sabbath.

528
00:38:17,870 --> 00:38:20,780
Lily says they don't his eyes,

529
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:23,660
they don't look like they
see what he's looking at.

530
00:38:23,750 --> 00:38:28,750
What is he looking at them I think
were meant to understand that he is so

531
00:38:29,211 --> 00:38:32,300
focused on the question of redemption

532
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:37,270
that he fails.
See anything else.

533
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:43,200
He fails to see any one else in his
preoccupation with that problem.

534
00:38:43,870 --> 00:38:48,870
Now I want to switch gears just for the
last couple of minutes and ask you what

535
00:38:49,451 --> 00:38:50,470
do you see?

536
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:56,350
What do you see when you read this
novel and I'm going to suggest to you

537
00:38:56,351 --> 00:39:00,580
something to think about.
I see body parts.

538
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:01,960
When I read this novel,

539
00:39:02,650 --> 00:39:06,310
I see a lot of dismembered body parts.

540
00:39:07,030 --> 00:39:08,170
What do I mean by that?
Well,

541
00:39:08,230 --> 00:39:12,490
let's take a look on page 32

542
00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:16,360
try 28 see if you can find it.

543
00:39:20,970 --> 00:39:25,440
This is Hayes coming to
the house of Leroy Watts.

544
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:34,180
He went up to the front porch and put his
eye to a convenient crack in the shade

545
00:39:34,990 --> 00:39:38,410
and found himself looking
directly at a large white knee.

546
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:40,833
Yeah,

547
00:39:40,930 --> 00:39:43,630
and what's she doing?
She's cutting her toenails.

548
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:47,680
Mrs. Watts was sitting alone in a white
iron bed cutting her toenails with a

549
00:39:47,681 --> 00:39:48,910
large pair of scissors.

550
00:39:49,330 --> 00:39:53,050
She was a big woman with very yellow
hair and white skin that glistened with a

551
00:39:53,051 --> 00:39:58,000
greasy preparation she had on a pink
nightgown that would have better fit,

552
00:39:58,001 --> 00:40:01,120
a smaller figure that large white knee.

553
00:40:01,870 --> 00:40:06,870
The way this narration allows us to see
through Hazel's eyes begins to take the

554
00:40:10,421 --> 00:40:14,710
whole body apart.
So what he sees is not Mrs. Watts,

555
00:40:14,711 --> 00:40:16,570
he sees a large white knee.

556
00:40:16,810 --> 00:40:21,810
We saw a version of this also in the
passage I was reading just before where a

557
00:40:22,691 --> 00:40:27,640
hand comes in the window and rests,

558
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:31,090
lands on Hayes's shoulder,

559
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:35,110
a square red face,
and then these things,

560
00:40:35,111 --> 00:40:39,760
these body parts are then referred
to with the Pronoun. It, it,

561
00:40:39,790 --> 00:40:43,450
the hand did this or
that. Um, take a look at

562
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,170
page 18.

563
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:53,230
Yeah,

564
00:40:53,230 --> 00:40:54,850
this is Mrs Hitchcock

565
00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:02,040
in the train is Hayes bumping into
Mrs Hitchcock going around the corner.

566
00:41:02,291 --> 00:41:05,290
He ran into something heavy and pink.

567
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:08,050
It gasped and muttered clumsy.

568
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:12,910
It was Mrs Hitchcock and a pink wrapper
with her hair in knots around her head.

569
00:41:12,911 --> 00:41:16,780
She looked at him with her eyes squinted,
nearly shut the knobs,

570
00:41:16,781 --> 00:41:19,450
framed her face like dark toadstools.

571
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:21,910
She tried to get past him
and he tried to let her,

572
00:41:21,911 --> 00:41:23,920
but they were both moving
the same way each time.

573
00:41:24,070 --> 00:41:28,270
Her face became purpleish
except for little white marks
over it that didn't heat

574
00:41:28,271 --> 00:41:31,780
up.
It's like she's rotting.

575
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:36,710
There's mushrooms growing on her
figurative mushrooms growing on her head.

576
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:42,140
Her face is purple except for the white
marks, the white marks or little scars,

577
00:41:42,170 --> 00:41:43,910
acne scars.
Perhaps

578
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:47,460
she is a p,

579
00:41:47,510 --> 00:41:51,860
a sort of mass of flesh as Mrs. Watts.
That Pink Rapper,

580
00:41:51,861 --> 00:41:56,300
these actually to pee pink
wrappers too tight on their bodies,

581
00:41:56,900 --> 00:42:00,170
suggest the excess of
their corporate reality.

582
00:42:00,860 --> 00:42:05,690
They're big hunks of flesh
on 62

583
00:42:07,470 --> 00:42:07,820
yeah,

584
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:12,410
we get Hayes's.
An account of Hayes Hayes is a

585
00:42:13,910 --> 00:42:15,110
childhood sin.

586
00:42:15,111 --> 00:42:19,190
He goes into the freak show at the fair

587
00:42:22,050 --> 00:42:25,950
and he joins the crowd where
his father also is there.

588
00:42:25,951 --> 00:42:29,640
We're looking down into a little into a
lowered place where something white was

589
00:42:29,641 --> 00:42:34,620
lying, squirming a little in a box
line with black cloth for a second.

590
00:42:34,621 --> 00:42:38,310
He thought it was a skinned animal
and then he saw it was a woman

591
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:44,730
on 15 I'm going to skip back to the train.

592
00:42:46,410 --> 00:42:49,290
I'm just going to rack these up for
you and then we'll think about them.

593
00:42:52,090 --> 00:42:55,210
This is Hayes waiting to be seated
in the dining car of the train.

594
00:42:55,211 --> 00:42:59,800
He's hesitated and saw the hand
jerk again, the hand of the steward.

595
00:43:00,310 --> 00:43:01,300
He lurched up the aisle,

596
00:43:01,301 --> 00:43:04,810
falling against two tables on the way
and getting his hand wet in somebody's

597
00:43:04,811 --> 00:43:08,990
coffee.
The steward placed him between uh,

598
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,580
with three young youngish
women dress like parrots.

599
00:43:11,790 --> 00:43:15,600
Their hands were resting on the table,
read speared at the tips.

600
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:20,250
He sat and looked in front of him.
I'm skipping down a little bit.

601
00:43:20,251 --> 00:43:24,270
Glomerin intense at the neck of the
woman across from him at intervals.

602
00:43:24,271 --> 00:43:27,660
Her hand holding the cigarette
would pass the spot on her neck.

603
00:43:27,870 --> 00:43:31,320
It would go out of its his site
and then it would pass. Again,

604
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:33,180
going back down to the table,

605
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:37,560
what do we make of these
odd moments of description?

606
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:41,640
Why all these body parts hanging around?

607
00:43:41,670 --> 00:43:46,670
Why this sense of disgusting
excessive body matter.

608
00:43:49,870 --> 00:43:54,850
It's often women who appear in this guys,
but it's not always women.

609
00:43:56,530 --> 00:44:01,530
What I want to suggest to you is that
when we actually look at the sentences on

610
00:44:04,871 --> 00:44:05,291
the page,

611
00:44:05,291 --> 00:44:10,291
when we look at the words that O'Connor
chose in the moments of the narration,

612
00:44:12,910 --> 00:44:17,910
we see something that becomes
more complicated than the
Flannery O'connor is a

613
00:44:19,691 --> 00:44:24,400
Catholic writer, haze motes.
Is it Christian mongrave Louie.

614
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:29,260
That's a kind of focus.

615
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:33,900
If we think about this and
analogize it to how Hayes looks,

616
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:39,680
it's a way of looking at our Connor's
fiction that sees nothing but the theology

617
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:44,910
behind it that sees nothing
but the Christian iconography.

618
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:51,360
And I want to ask what is it that
we don't see when that's all we see.

619
00:44:52,710 --> 00:44:53,850
What do we miss?

620
00:44:55,050 --> 00:45:00,050
I've be gone to point out a few things
that I think we miss the fragmentation of

621
00:45:00,661 --> 00:45:04,590
bodies. Why our bodies consistently
fragmented, not just here.

622
00:45:04,740 --> 00:45:06,420
Everywhere in O'connor's fiction,

623
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:09,780
people are always losing
a wooden leg and you know,

624
00:45:09,781 --> 00:45:12,210
having bar parts of their limbs fall off.

625
00:45:12,330 --> 00:45:15,360
It's very hard to keep a
body together in O'Connor.

626
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:20,340
Hard to keep body and soul to get
well. Well, I won't get into that. Um,

627
00:45:21,690 --> 00:45:22,830
so why is that?

628
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:27,720
What kind of methodology for reading
would allow us to have something to say

629
00:45:27,721 --> 00:45:31,710
about that. Is it something we need
to have something to say about?

630
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:36,800
Is it in the same register of importance
in our reading as some of these more

631
00:45:38,731 --> 00:45:43,731
theological structural considerations
that have been offered to us in her

632
00:45:43,951 --> 00:45:48,951
letters and her preface and in the very
overt symbology of the landscape scenes

633
00:45:51,060 --> 00:45:55,770
of these other scenes that I was reading
to you today in that image of the

634
00:45:55,771 --> 00:45:57,270
unhoused believer,

635
00:45:57,720 --> 00:46:01,170
trying to find a home in a an alien world.

636
00:46:02,850 --> 00:46:04,290
So in my next lecture,

637
00:46:04,291 --> 00:46:08,430
what I'm going to do is
pretty much contradiction.

638
00:46:08,490 --> 00:46:09,540
Most of what I said today,

639
00:46:10,710 --> 00:46:15,710
I'm going to set aside theology
as the lens through which I read,

640
00:46:18,330 --> 00:46:23,330
and if you felt you were convinced by
my reading of that iconography in these

641
00:46:24,061 --> 00:46:28,320
passages, then you want to think
about why that's convincing.

642
00:46:29,190 --> 00:46:34,190
Whether you want to think about how much
attention and primacy we should give to

643
00:46:34,561 --> 00:46:38,760
an author, statements about
what her work means as readers.

644
00:46:39,150 --> 00:46:43,080
Maybe you want to say,
you can't argue with that.

645
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:44,730
We have to accept that.

646
00:46:45,570 --> 00:46:50,310
That's really what the writer intends
to say, and that's what we should see.

647
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:53,280
And that's what we should
strive to understand. Well,

648
00:46:53,281 --> 00:46:55,440
I'm going to offer you two different ways,

649
00:46:55,441 --> 00:47:00,300
actually more like three different
ways to look at the novel in the second

650
00:47:00,301 --> 00:47:04,800
lecture. So finish the novel
for next Wednesday, and, um,

651
00:47:04,830 --> 00:47:05,760
and we will go from there.
