00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:02.300
Teflon was Invented by Accident

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:06.100
The man who accidentally invented Teflon was
Dr. Roy Plunkett.

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:11.210
After receiving his BA, MS, and eventually
PhD in organic chemistry, Dr. Plunkett took

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:13.559
a job with DuPont, in Jackson New Jersey.

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.710
He was subsequently assigned to work on synthesizing
various new forms of refrigerant, trying to

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:23.430
find a non-toxic alternative to refrigerants
like sulfur dioxide and ammonia.

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:29.310
According to DuPont, in 1938, 27 year old
Dr. Plunkett and his assistant, Jack Rebok,

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.840
were experimenting with one such potential
alternative refrigerant, tetrafluorethylene

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:34.840
(TFE).

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:40.250
Dr. Plunkett subsequently created around 100
pounds of TFE and stored the gas in small

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:41.250
cylinders.

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.530
On April 6, 1938, upon opening the valve on
one of the supposedly full pressurized cylinders

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.900
of TFE that had previously been frozen, nothing
came out, even though by its weight, it seemed

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:52.900
to still be full.

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:56.680
The two then decided to investigate further
by cutting the cylinder open.

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:01.149
Once they managed to get it open, they discovered
that the TFE gas inside had polymerized into

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:06.150
a waxy white powder, polytetrafluoroethylene
(PTFE) resin.

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.020
Ever the scientist, Plunkett then proceeded
to run tests on this new substance to see

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.750
if it had any unique or useful properties.

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.630
Four of the most important properties of this
substance discovered were that it was extremely

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:21.790
slippery (one of the slipperiest substances
known to man), non-corrosive, chemically stable,

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:24.470
and that it had an extremely high melting
point.

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:28.229
These properties were deemed interesting enough
that the study of the substance was transferred

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.220
to DuPont’s Central Research Department
and assigned to chemists that had special

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:37.170
experience in polymer research and development,
while Dr. Plunkett was then promoted and transferred

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.990
to a separate division that produced tetraethyl,
used to boost gasoline octane levels.

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:46.120
Three years later, the process and name of
Teflon were patented and trademarked.

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:50.100
Four years after that, Teflon first began
being sold, initially only used for various

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.850
industrial and military applications due to
the expense of producing TFE.

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:59.600
By the 1960s, various forms of Teflon were
being used in a variety of applications, such

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.540
as stain repellant in fabrics, electrical
wire insulation, and the like.

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:08.649
It was also in the 1960s that Teflon began
being used in its most publicly known application,

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:10.520
as a coating for non-stick pans.

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:15.569
Today, Teflon or other brands of the same
product are also used in windshield wipers;

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:20.000
carpets and furniture (as a stain repellant);
light bulbs; coating on glasses; in various

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.340
hair products; used in semiconductor manufacturing;
automotive lubricant; igniters for solid-fuel

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:30.150
rocket propellants; and in infrared decoy
flares, among other things.

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.180
Bonus Facts:
• Dr. Plunkett’s roommate in college,

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:38.810
Paul Flory, went on to win the Nobel Prize
in chemistry in 1974.

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:42.770
• The Guinness Book of World Records once
listed Teflon as the slipperiest substance

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:43.840
in existence.

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.920
This has since been shown to be incorrect,
actually being the third slipperiest substance.

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.990
Although, it still is the only known substance
that a gecko’s feet cannot stick to, because

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:54.379
of Teflon’s resistance to van der Waals
forces.

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:58.730
Van der Waals forces are the sum of the attractive
and repulsive forces between molecules.

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:00.940

of this podcast: Why Geckos’ Feet Can Stick

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:02.540
to Almost Anything
• Molecularly, Teflon is one of the largest

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:05.940
molecules known to man and consists of carbon
and fluorine.

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.730
Each carbon atom has two fluorine atoms attached.

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:13.150
It turns out, when fluorine is part of a molecule,
it actually repels other matter.

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:17.650
The bond between the fluorine and carbon is
also extremely strong which makes Teflon very

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.890
non-reactive to other chemicals, which is
why it was used in the Manhattan Project as

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:28.180
a coating for the valves and seals of containers
holding the extremely reactive uranium hexafluoride.

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:34.310
• Dr. Plunkett retired from DuPont in 1975
and was inducted into the Plastics Hall of

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:39.870
Fame in 1973 and eventually into the National
Inventors’ Hall of Fame in 1985.

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:55.310
He died on May 12, 1994.
