00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.000
Seinfeld would have been a lot different with
another actress playing Elaine, and that’s

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.200
what would have happened if Julia Louis-Dreyfus
had decided to live the life of an heiress

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:19.490
rather than pursue acting.

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:22.289
And that wasn’t out of the realm of possibility.

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:27.560
Julia’s father is multi-billionaire Gerard
Louis-Dreyfus and her family tree is littered

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:31.880
with extremely wealthy and successful (in
business) individuals going back over a century-

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.589
as such Julia probably didn’t need to work
a day in her life.

00:00:35.589 --> 00:00:37.559
You wouldn’t know it from listening to her,
though.

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.989
In an interview conducted on the Howard Stern
Show in 2003, Julia denied that she was brought

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:45.079
up “rich” and didn’t need to worry about
money, saying:

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:47.000
No, my father’s not a billionaire.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.289
And I work mainly for money…

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:50.960
[My dad runs] this company in France called
the Louis-Dreyfus Corporation.

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.710
It’s a company that does well, but it isn’t
the Dreyfus Fund.

00:00:54.710 --> 00:01:00.710
While it’s true that the company isn’t
the “Dreyfus Fund,” today Forbes estimates

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.399
Gerard’s net worth at $3.2 billion.

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:11.210
The company was founded by Julia’s great-great-grandfather,
Léopold Louis-Dreyfus, in 1851, so the business

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.580
has been kept in the family for generations.

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:17.560
Of course, she might not have been “raised
rich” all the same—at least not billionaire

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:18.560
rich.

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.130
Julia was born in 1961, and just a year later
her parents divorced.

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.860
The separation undoubtedly caused some splitting
of the family’s assets.

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.500
Further, the family fortune, which at one
time was called one of “the five greatest

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.100
fortunes in France” was diminished quite
a bit due to WWII.

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.950
However, it’s something of an understatement
to only say the “company does well.”

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:43.490
Today, the Louis-Dreyfus Group has about $120
billion in gross annual sales, and is estimated

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:45.700
to be worth about $46 billion.

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:46.920
“Well” indeed.

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:52.780
Besides Julia’s father doing OK for himself,
her now deceased cousin, Robert Louis-Dreyfus

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:57.650
was at one point the CEO of Adidas and was
extremely successful in his own right in various

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:58.980
business ventures.

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:03.710
His wife inherited that branch of the family
fortune in 2009, also taking over management

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:07.650
of her husband’s various companies, and
today she is considered to be the wealthiest

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:10.480
woman in Russia, with a net-worth of about
$6 billion.

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:15.420
On top of that, there are several other members
of the Louis-Dreyfus family tree, descended

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.060
from Léopold Louis-Dreyfus, that have similar
accomplishments in the business world.

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:20.060
One can only imagine what their family reunions
are like.

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.350
That said, Julia is a successful, wealthy
actress in her own right.

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:27.300
She certainly earned the respect of her father
for making her own way in the world rather

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.049
than depending on the family fortune.

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:33.609
In the last few years of Seinfeld, she was
earning $600,000 per episode.

00:02:33.609 --> 00:02:38.230
But Julia started off acting in relatively
humble beginnings—as a theatre student at

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:39.670
Northwestern University.

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:43.639
After she finished her education there, she
became involved in the Practical Theatre Company

00:02:43.639 --> 00:02:46.510
in Chicago, which her husband had helped to
start.

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:49.739
She also worked as part of the Second City
comedy troupe.

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:54.639
Afterwards, she auditioned for Saturday Night
Live, which she was on from 1982-1985.

00:02:54.639 --> 00:02:58.760
Following that, she was cast in a couple of
sitcoms and starred in two Woody Allen films

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:22.590
before 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:35.980
her big break: Seinfeld.
