00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.510
Does the internet make
you angry sometimes?

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:05.080
Yeah, turns out that's
exactly what it's best at.

00:00:11.169 --> 00:00:12.210
Anthony here, for D News.

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.430
And new research out of
Beijing University in China

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:17.830
showed that anger
is the emotion most

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:19.700
likely to spread
through the internet.

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:22.120
For six months in
2010, researchers

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:25.220
monitored Weibo, which is kind
of a China specific Twitter

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.970
with 500 million users and 100
million status updates a day.

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:31.380
They tracked updates with
different emotional content--

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.300
joy, sadness, anger and disgust.

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.380
And then they looked at the
fallout from those updates.

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.406
If someone tweeted
something sad, how likely

00:00:39.406 --> 00:00:40.905
was it that their
friends would also

00:00:40.905 --> 00:00:43.400
post something sad, but
unrelated afterwards.

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.310
Which sediments
got passed around,

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:48.190
re posted, or just
affected others the most.

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.190
The answer, anger,
by a long shot.

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:53.060
Sadness and disgust
hardly had enough

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:55.660
of an emotional ripple effect
on someone's social network

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:56.520
to measure.

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.070
Joy was slightly higher.

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:00.920
But angry tweets
caused a chain reaction

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.099
of about three additional
tweets within a social network.

00:01:04.099 --> 00:01:05.930
I post something
angry, then my friend

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:07.250
does, than his friend does.

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.650
And we all do it without
realizing the influence

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:10.850
that it has on us.

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:12.681
Now, this was only
done on Weibo.

00:01:12.681 --> 00:01:15.180
So we don't really know if it's
a cultural thing, maybe even

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.150
just a Weibo thing.

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:18.760
Maybe Weibo users are just mad.

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:21.010
But it does feel
like anger spreads

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:22.620
pretty quickly on
the internet, right?

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:24.700
Well, studying empathy
and emotion online

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.140
is a budding field with a
lot of early theory and just

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:28.860
a few studies.

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.010
But the findings so far
have been interesting.

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:33.270
Some studies say that the
anonymity of the internet

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.240
causes people to
leave angrier comments

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.980
and be more willing to
respond in an emotionally

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:39.290
uninhibited way.

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:42.260
But others say that anonymity
has never really affected

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.230
self awareness in
any other mediums,

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:46.280
so it shouldn't online.

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.350
We also use a lot of
visual and auditory cues

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.890
to understand somebody in person
that we just can't use online.

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.130
Stripping someone's tone
of voice or body language

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:58.310
away from a situation can
cause us to read more strongly

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:59.970
into any written cues, right.

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:02.780
So we see an angry word
like hate in a comment

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.780
and we imagine it delivered in
just the angriest way possible.

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:08.570
And it's in our nature to
heighten emotion and jump

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:09.169
into things.

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:12.060
We've talked a bit about
mirror neurons and our amygdala

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:12.560
before.

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.059
These are the bits
of our brain that

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:16.250
fire when we see someone
else doing something.

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.400
We use them to learn
about other people

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.550
and figure out how to
respond appropriately.

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.010
They create empathy.

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.990
So if we read something and
feel that someone we care about

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:26.740
is angry, that affects us.

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:30.230
But why doesn't sadness or
joy spread as fast then?

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:32.166
Well, in Trace's video
about internet trolls

00:02:32.166 --> 00:02:33.790
he talked about
motivational reasoning.

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:37.080
How our brain is wired
to react emotionally,

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:38.970
long before the
logical cognitive

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:40.730
bits can even get involved.

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:42.470
And anger's an
emotion which tends

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.450
to cause impulsive
action, which might

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:46.010
explain why it spreads more.

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.581
Obviously a lot of early
research, but very interesting

00:02:48.581 --> 00:02:49.080
stuff.

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.870
This is how we communicate now.

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:53.184
We should pay more attention
to how it's affecting us.

00:02:53.184 --> 00:02:54.600
I try to picture
everything I read

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.370
online in the voice of Stephen
Hawking's little speech box,

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:00.320
because it strips a lot of that
false emotional inference out

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.960
of things.

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:03.590
And it also makes me feel like
Steven Hawking is my friend.

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:05.400
Does the internet
make you angry?

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:06.380
What do you about it?

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:09.710
Let us know down in the non
angry totally joyful comments

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:10.330
below.
