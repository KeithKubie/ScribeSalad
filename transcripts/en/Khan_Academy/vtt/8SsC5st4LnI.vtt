00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:03.870
Welcome to the video on
the Taylor Theorem and

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:05.330
Taylor polynomials.

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:07.190
And we've actually
already touched on this.

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:10.980
When we did the videos on
approximating functions with

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.430
polynomials, we used Maclaurin
series, which is actually a

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:16.060
special case of the Taylor
polynomial or the

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:16.940
Taylor Theorem.

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:19.980
And we just pick, we
approximate the function

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.630
around x equals 0 when we
did the Maclaurin series.

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:25.680
But in general, you could
approximate a function

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:26.890
around any value.

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:30.090
And if you do it around
something other than 0, it's

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.980
kind of the more general
case, and we're dealing

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.680
with the Taylor polynomial.

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:34.640
So what is that?

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.680
Let me just write the
definition down, and then we'll

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.110
do a couple of examples, and
then we'll graph it to

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:40.280
get the intuition.

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.550
So a Taylor polynomial says
that if I have a differentiable

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:51.860
function f of x, and I want
to approximate it with a

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:57.120
polynomial at c, so at some
value of x equals c, I want to

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.370
approximate this function.

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:00.070
So let me just draw a quick and
dirty one, and we'll actually

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:02.310
draw an accurate one later.

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:06.980
So let's say that that's
my axes, this is my

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:10.610
function f of x.

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:14.260
So I could pick some value
c, some value x is equal to

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.730
c, maybe it's right there.

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:18.970
So that's c.

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:21.540
And I would want to approximate
it, I would want to create a

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.280
polynomial that can approximate
the function around this point.

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.520
And the Taylor Theorem tells us
that the Taylor polynomial to

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.160
approximate this is, and then
I'll give you the intuition

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:34.950
for it in a second.

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.030
p of x.

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.420
And this looks really
complicated, but when you

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.510
do some examples, you'll
see it's not so bad.

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:57.710
p of x is equal to f of c plus
f prime of c times x minus c

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:04.470
plus f prime prime of c over,
they say 2 factorial, which is

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:07.080
just 2, but OK, I'll
write 2 factorial.

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:08.940
They do that so that you see
the pattern that emerges.

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.850
This is over 1 factorial,
really, and this is over

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:15.030
0 factorial, really.

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:21.240
Times x minus c squared plus,
I'm already running out of

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:25.970
space, f the third derivative,
I think at this point people

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:31.210
just write a 3 in parentheses,
of the function evaluated at c

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:37.770
over 3 factorial times x minus
c to the third, and you could

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:39.030
just keep adding terms.

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.570
You could go on like
this for infinity.

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:45.640
But let me give you the
intuition of what this is.

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.470
Let me just show you, just
to hit the point home.

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:52.590
Then you could plus the fourth
derivative of the function

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:59.190
evaluated at c times over 4
factorial times x minus

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.070
c to the fourth.

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:02.950
Now what's the intuition?

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:06.440
So first of all, what happens
to this polynomial at c?

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:09.110
So what's p of c?

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:15.700
p of c is equal to-- if p of c,
everywhere where you see an x

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.390
here, you have to
put a c, right?

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:20.960
So this term would be c minus
c, so that would go to

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:22.790
zero, or it would be 0.

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:25.470
This term would be c
minus c, it would be 0.

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:28.030
This term would be c minus
c, so it would be 0.

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:29.490
This term would
be c minus c, 0.

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:31.310
And all you'd be left
with is this f of c.

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:35.150
So great.

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:38.750
We already know that, at least
at the value of c, the

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:40.590
polynomial is equal
to the function.

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:42.340
So it's going to
intersect this line.

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:42.730
Right?

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:46.380
And actually, if we just had a
Taylor polynomial with just

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:47.800
that first term, what
would it look like?

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:49.940
Well, it would just be a
horizontal line right there.

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:53.150
So it would be a pretty
bad approximation.

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:55.260
But, what does this
second term do us?

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:56.900
Because we know that if
we just evaluated c.

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:58.830
All these other terms
just drop out.

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:00.610
So what do they do for us?

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:04.280
Well, the second term actually
ensures that the derivative of

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:08.030
this polynomial, evaluated at
c, is equal to the derivative

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:10.100
of this function,
evaluated at c.

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:11.235
What do I mean there?

00:04:11.235 --> 00:04:14.580
Well, what's p prime of x?

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:19.410
p prime of x is equal to, well,
this is just a constant term.

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:22.030
It might look like a function,
but it's a function evaluated

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:24.210
at c, so it's just
a constant term.

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:25.850
And so, that's 0.

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:26.640
And then, what is this?

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:28.590
What's the derivative of this?

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:32.965
Well, we could use, this is
a constant term, and the

00:04:32.965 --> 00:04:34.910
derivative of this is just 1.

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:37.630
So you could almost just view
this as f prime of c times x,

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:40.630
minus f prime of c times c
which is a constant, whatever.

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:47.390
So the derivative of this
expression is f of c, and then

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:50.610
plus the derivative of this
expression, and that's

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:51.310
equal to what?

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:56.010
2 times 2 divided by 2
factorial, which is just 1.

00:04:56.010 --> 00:05:02.130
So it's f prime prime of
c, times x minus c, and

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:04.310
then plus, let's see.

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:07.890
3 over 3 factorial, so that's
3 over 6, we'll just have

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:10.220
a 2 in the denominator.

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:15.820
f prime prime prime of
c over, what was it, 2

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:19.636
times x minus c squared--

00:05:19.636 --> 00:05:21.520
And you don't have to
worry about all of this.

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:22.630
And then, we could
just keep going.

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:24.380
But I wanted just to
show you one thing.

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:27.560
What is t prime at c?

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:28.740
t prime at c.

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:31.580
What is the derivative
of this polynomial when

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:34.660
you evaluate it at c?

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:38.650
Well, when you put c into this
derivative function, all these

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:40.180
other terms are going to drop
off, and you're just

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:42.440
left with this one.

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:42.640
Right?

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:45.930
Because this x minus c--
sorry, just had some walnuts.

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:47.730
I should have some
water with it.

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:50.970
If you put the c
here, they drop out.

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:54.420
So the derivative of this
function evaluated at c,

00:05:54.420 --> 00:06:01.000
is equal to f prime of c.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.610
So as you can see, what's neat
about this Taylor polynomial

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:10.540
is, it's equal to the function
at c, its derivative is equal

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:14.570
to the function at c, the
second derivative is equal

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:15.590
to the function at c.

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:19.820
And every term you add to the
Taylor polynomial actually

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:25.100
makes it so that that term,
derivative, of the polynomial

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:28.190
evaluated at c, is
equal to the function.

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:29.570
Hope I didn't confuse you.

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:33.440
The big picture is, the whole
thinking behind, I guess, what

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:36.470
Taylor thought of, was, wow.

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:41.270
If this function is infinitely
differentiable, meaning that I

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:43.960
can take the first, second,
third, fourth, you know, all

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:48.460
the way to infinity derivative
of this function, I could

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:51.550
construct a polynomial like
this, and i can just keep going

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:55.960
by adding more and more terms,
so that this polynomial's, you

00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:59.350
know, zeroth derivative, which
is means the function, the 0,

00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:02.300
first, second, third, fourth,
all of this polynomial's

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:05.610
derivatives are going to
be equal to the function.

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:06.835
At least around that point.

00:07:06.835 --> 00:07:09.020
And actually, we'll see that
there's actually a whole class

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:11.820
of functions, that the Taylor
polynomial, if you were to take

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:16.960
the infinite series, is
actually equal to that

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:18.180
function at all points.

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:18.640
But anyway.

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:20.730
And actually, I talk a little
bit about that when I prove

00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:24.490
that e to the i pi is equal to
negative 1, which to me was the

00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:28.080
most amazing result
in mathematics.

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:29.350
Whatever, whatever.

00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:31.650
This might have been a little
confusing for you, so let's

00:07:31.650 --> 00:07:33.810
do a particular example.

00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:38.805
The particulars are
always the more fun.

00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:43.580
I think when you see me do
an example, you'll see

00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:45.430
that it's not so bad.

00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:47.285
I'm even going to erase
this fourth term.

00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:57.630
So let's approximate, I
don't know, cosine of x.

00:07:57.630 --> 00:08:00.154
So let's say that f of x
is equal to, let me do

00:08:00.154 --> 00:08:01.520
it in a different color.

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:06.310
We want to approximate f of x
is equal to cosine of access.

00:08:06.310 --> 00:08:07.600
And let's pick some
arbitrary number.

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:09.650
Let's not pick some number
that works well with

00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:10.550
trigonometric functions.

00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:14.200
Let's pick around, let's
say c is equal to 2.

00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:15.710
No, 1.

00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:22.380
So we're going to approximate
cosine of x around 1.

00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:25.100
So what is the Taylor
approximation, or the

00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:26.300
Taylor polynomial?

00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:29.770
Well, we could just
chug through this one.

00:08:29.770 --> 00:08:33.280
p of x, I'll do it in yellow.

00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:37.830
p of x is equal to f of c.

00:08:37.830 --> 00:08:45.090
So the function evaluated at c
is just cosine of 1, right?

00:08:45.090 --> 00:08:48.560
plus s prime of c.

00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:51.410
Well, what is the
derivative of cosine of x?

00:08:51.410 --> 00:08:54.360
It's minus sine of x, right?

00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:56.820
Minus sine of x, and we
want to evaluate it at c.

00:08:56.820 --> 00:09:04.770
So it's minus sine of 1,
right? c is one, that's

00:09:04.770 --> 00:09:06.390
we're approximating around.

00:09:06.390 --> 00:09:10.210
Times x minus c.

00:09:10.210 --> 00:09:15.320
And then, plus the
second derivative of x.

00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:16.150
So what's the
second derivative?

00:09:16.150 --> 00:09:18.140
What's going to be the
derivative of minus sine,

00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:21.180
which is minus cosine of x?

00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:23.380
So it's minus cosine.

00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:25.920
But we're evaluating it at c,
so there's actually going

00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:27.080
to be a number, right?

00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:28.910
So c is 1.

00:09:28.910 --> 00:09:31.920
Cosine of 1.

00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:35.570
Over 2, right?

00:09:35.570 --> 00:09:37.420
2 factorial is just 2.

00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:42.030
Times x minus 1 squared,
oh, sorry, this should

00:09:42.030 --> 00:09:44.500
be a one, right?

00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:46.480
I said, c is equal to 1.

00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:49.040
Times x minus 1 squared.

00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:50.220
Let's keep going.

00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:53.540
Plus the third derivative,
plus, what's the third

00:09:53.540 --> 00:09:55.590
derivative of cosine?

00:09:55.590 --> 00:09:58.160
Well, it's the derivative
of minus cosine, so

00:09:58.160 --> 00:09:59.820
that's plus sign.

00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:04.380
So plus sine evaluated at 1.

00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:06.790
Sine of 1.

00:10:06.790 --> 00:10:12.656
Divided by 3 factorial,
so that's 6 over 6 times

00:10:12.656 --> 00:10:16.850
x minus 3 to third.

00:10:16.850 --> 00:10:22.330
Sorry, my brain is really,
I ate too many walnuts.

00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:27.500
Undo, edit, undo. x minus
1 to the third, right?

00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:31.540
And then, let's do one
more term, just for fun.

00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:33.740
So then we're going to take the
fourth derivative, which is the

00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:37.260
derivative of the third
derivative, so the third

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:39.057
derivative was positive sine,
so now we're going

00:10:39.057 --> 00:10:41.910
to be plus cosine.

00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:47.160
Plus cosine evaluated at
1 over 4 factorial--

00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:47.790
what's 4 factorial?

00:10:47.790 --> 00:10:50.180
It's 3 factorial times 4.

00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:52.590
So over 24.

00:10:52.590 --> 00:10:55.290
Times x minus 1 to the fourth.

00:10:55.290 --> 00:10:56.240
And we could just keep going.

00:10:56.240 --> 00:11:00.590
The fifth derivative over 5
evaluated at 1, over 5

00:11:00.590 --> 00:11:03.450
factorial times x minus 1 to
the fifth, and just keep

00:11:03.450 --> 00:11:04.800
adding, but then it will
take us forever, et

00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:06.380
cetera, et cetera.

00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:08.660
So, what does this
thing look like?

00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:10.730
And what I'm going to do, is
I'm going to show you how

00:11:10.730 --> 00:11:13.710
this polynomial develops
as we add terms.

00:11:13.710 --> 00:11:14.540
So let's see.

00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:19.510
I have this graphing calculator
that I-- so this thing I

00:11:19.510 --> 00:11:25.960
got from, just to give them
credit, it's my.hrw.com.

00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:28.930
And this is the graph
of cosine of x.

00:11:28.930 --> 00:11:31.030
So just the first term here.

00:11:31.030 --> 00:11:32.120
Cosine of 1.

00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:34.780
If we were to just to graph the
first term of this polynomial,

00:11:34.780 --> 00:11:36.810
what does it look like?

00:11:36.810 --> 00:11:43.510
So I'll just type in cosine
of 1, and graph it.

00:11:43.510 --> 00:11:44.110
So there you go.

00:11:44.110 --> 00:11:45.590
Just the first term
of the polynomial.

00:11:45.590 --> 00:11:49.110
If all of these terms weren't
here, the polynomial would

00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:50.030
just be a constant, right?

00:11:50.030 --> 00:11:51.800
Cosine of one.

00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:54.510
And it's a pretty bad
approximation, but at least

00:11:54.510 --> 00:11:56.240
it equals the function
at this point.

00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:59.490
So it gives a something.

00:11:59.490 --> 00:12:00.690
But let's add some terms.

00:12:00.690 --> 00:12:02.290
Let's add the
second term to it.

00:12:02.290 --> 00:12:03.980
So what was the second term?

00:12:03.980 --> 00:12:08.390
It was sine of 1 minus sine
of 1 times x minus 1.

00:12:08.390 --> 00:12:09.210
Let me add that.

00:12:23.650 --> 00:12:25.840
Graph it.

00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:26.960
There you go.

00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:27.790
So this is neat.

00:12:27.790 --> 00:12:30.060
So when you just added 2
terms, what did we say?

00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:37.330
The polynomial will be equal to
the function at x equals 1.

00:12:37.330 --> 00:12:40.380
And now the slope is also
equal to the function.

00:12:40.380 --> 00:12:43.160
The slope of the polynomial is
also equal to the slope of the

00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:44.840
function at x is equal to 1.

00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:46.190
So this is a better
approximation.

00:12:46.190 --> 00:12:51.550
At least if we stay pretty
close to our chosen c, it's

00:12:51.550 --> 00:12:55.490
a decent approximation
for the function.

00:12:55.490 --> 00:12:58.620
Obviously, if we get far away,
out here, this is a horrible

00:12:58.620 --> 00:12:59.840
approximation for the function.

00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:01.200
But let's keep adding terms.

00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:04.000
As you can see, I just want
to show you that I'm just

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.950
typing in the actual terms.

00:13:07.950 --> 00:13:09.850
So let me type in
the next term.

00:13:09.850 --> 00:13:12.830
just so you believe
that I'm doing it.

00:13:12.830 --> 00:13:15.050
So the next term,
we'll have to see it.

00:13:15.050 --> 00:13:16.050
Let me type it in.

00:13:16.050 --> 00:13:27.440
So the next term is minus
cosine of 1 divided by 2

00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:35.420
times x minus 1 squared.

00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:38.660
And let me graph it.

00:13:38.660 --> 00:13:39.600
OK.

00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:42.220
So now, just to show you, I
just typed in the second

00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:45.980
term, and now let's
look at the graph.

00:13:45.980 --> 00:13:47.970
Now this is neat, right?

00:13:47.970 --> 00:13:50.720
So the first term got us a
horizontal line that just

00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:53.220
intersected the point at cosine
of 1, and it was a really

00:13:53.220 --> 00:13:54.190
bad approximation.

00:13:54.190 --> 00:13:56.590
Then the second term made sure
that at least the first

00:13:56.590 --> 00:13:57.910
derivative was the same.

00:13:57.910 --> 00:14:00.760
And so then we, the line was
just essentially the tangent

00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:02.210
line, we only had 2 terms.

00:14:02.210 --> 00:14:06.320
Now the third term makes sure
that the second derivative of

00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:11.980
our polynomial at x equals 1 is
equal to the second derivative

00:14:11.980 --> 00:14:14.810
of the polynomial
of the function.

00:14:14.810 --> 00:14:19.100
And notice that this
green graph is concave

00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:20.390
downwards, right?

00:14:20.390 --> 00:14:25.110
Which means that, and so
is the function at 1.

00:14:25.110 --> 00:14:26.270
So this is this is pretty neat.

00:14:26.270 --> 00:14:28.350
We're getting a little bit, so
it's kind of approximating

00:14:28.350 --> 00:14:30.060
the curve here.

00:14:30.060 --> 00:14:31.060
It's getting a
little bit better.

00:14:31.060 --> 00:14:32.950
Remember when we went
out far to the left?

00:14:32.950 --> 00:14:34.910
Starting to approximate the
function better around here.

00:14:34.910 --> 00:14:36.310
It's closer, at least.

00:14:36.310 --> 00:14:36.520
Right?

00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:38.560
The last time, the line just
went up, and here it was a

00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:40.350
really bad approximation.

00:14:40.350 --> 00:14:42.080
But let's add another term.

00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:43.120
Let's add our third term.

00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:46.860
Our third term, I can see
it, it's right there.

00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:56.870
So plus sine of 1 divided
by 6 times x minus 1

00:14:56.870 --> 00:14:59.950
to the third power.

00:14:59.950 --> 00:15:01.860
Just to show you, I just
typed it in, right there.

00:15:06.090 --> 00:15:09.060
Let me graph it.

00:15:09.060 --> 00:15:10.590
That is neat.

00:15:10.590 --> 00:15:16.240
Just with three terms on our
polynomial, well, actually,

00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:18.860
that's the fourth
term, officially.

00:15:18.860 --> 00:15:22.040
But the first term was
essentially-- well,

00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:23.280
you get the point.

00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:25.270
But we're already starting
to approximate this

00:15:25.270 --> 00:15:26.960
pretty well, right?

00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:33.320
Now the third derivative of the
polynomial is equal to the

00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:36.330
third derivative of the
function at the point x is

00:15:36.330 --> 00:15:38.530
equal to 1, and we haven't even
studied third derivatives.

00:15:38.530 --> 00:15:41.770
That's kind of like the
concativity of the

00:15:41.770 --> 00:15:43.490
derivative, or whatever.

00:15:43.490 --> 00:15:44.990
But as we can see,
it approximates the

00:15:44.990 --> 00:15:45.970
function even better.

00:15:45.970 --> 00:15:48.290
Obviously, though, when we
go further away, it starts

00:15:48.290 --> 00:15:49.000
to break down again.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:50.600
But pretty close.

00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:52.150
If all you saw is from
here to here, it would be

00:15:52.150 --> 00:15:53.880
hard to tell them apart.

00:15:53.880 --> 00:15:57.180
Let's add that last
term we calculated.

00:15:57.180 --> 00:15:58.780
And this should be pretty neat.

00:15:58.780 --> 00:15:59.520
Let's see.

00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:01.650
The last term.

00:16:01.650 --> 00:16:07.730
Plus cosine sign of
1 divided by 24.

00:16:07.730 --> 00:16:11.870
And notice, every term, the
scaling factor, right?

00:16:11.870 --> 00:16:15.830
Here's 1, then 1/2, then
1/6, 1/24-- it becomes

00:16:15.830 --> 00:16:17.160
a smaller impact on it.

00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:20.220
And it only starts to matter as
you move really, really far

00:16:20.220 --> 00:16:22.090
away from your chosen c.

00:16:22.090 --> 00:16:24.450
In this case 1, right.

00:16:24.450 --> 00:16:27.130
The further out you go,
when you're close to your

00:16:27.130 --> 00:16:28.720
point that you've picked.

00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:31.040
these other terms don't
matter much, right?

00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:33.460
Because you're doing 1/24,
and then 1 over 5 factorial,

00:16:33.460 --> 00:16:34.090
et cetera et cetera.

00:16:34.090 --> 00:16:37.400
But as you get further and
further away, these terms

00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:39.400
become more significant, right?

00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:42.790
As x gets further and further
away from 1, and then that's

00:16:42.790 --> 00:16:44.400
where these start to play in,
and you see that in

00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:45.710
the approximation.

00:16:45.710 --> 00:16:48.330
Anyway, let me graph it.

00:16:48.330 --> 00:17:00.450
So cosine of 1 divided by 24
times x minus 1 to the fourth.

00:17:00.450 --> 00:17:01.400
Let me graph it.

00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:06.220
Even neater!

00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:08.470
And if you have some spare
time, you might just want to

00:17:08.470 --> 00:17:10.050
keep adding terms to this.

00:17:10.050 --> 00:17:12.110
So that's all the
Taylor polynomial is.

00:17:12.110 --> 00:17:13.440
And I realize, this is
probably one of longest

00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:14.370
videos I've done.

00:17:14.370 --> 00:17:15.790
I'm pushing 17 minutes.

00:17:15.790 --> 00:17:17.870
It's a little confusing at
first, because it gives you

00:17:17.870 --> 00:17:20.730
this huge formula, and they
give you the c, and you're

00:17:20.730 --> 00:17:22.710
like, what is that c, and how
do I take the derivative?

00:17:22.710 --> 00:17:24.600
But when you actually try to
chug through it, you just

00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:25.770
have to realize, oh.

00:17:25.770 --> 00:17:30.760
All this is, is saying, we are
constructing a polynomial that,

00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:35.450
at some point c that we've
picked, this polynomial's

00:17:35.450 --> 00:17:38.740
zeroth, first, second, third,
fourth, fifth, and so on-th

00:17:38.740 --> 00:17:42.040
derivative is going to be
equal to our function.

00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:45.586
And actually, if we did 10
terms, or if we did all of the

00:17:45.586 --> 00:17:48.170
derivatives, these would start
to actually equal each other.

00:17:48.170 --> 00:17:49.730
So hopefully that
didn't confuse you.

00:17:49.730 --> 00:17:53.980
I know when you see the formula
at first, it can be kind of

00:17:53.980 --> 00:17:57.770
daunting, and especially,
sometimes it's even more

00:17:57.770 --> 00:17:59.600
daunting when someone
even explains it to you.

00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:01.420
But hopefully that gave
you some intuition.

00:18:01.420 --> 00:18:03.640
If it didn't,
ignore this video.

00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:05.142
See you soon.
