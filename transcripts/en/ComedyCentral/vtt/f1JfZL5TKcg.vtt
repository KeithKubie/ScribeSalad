WITH A POSITIVE MESSAGE
ABOUT OUR FORESTS.

THAT POEM WAS BLAZING HIP HOP.

00:01:13.373 --> 00:01:14.875

MEAN-SPIRITED, IS IT?

00:01:28.388 --> 00:01:29.389
- NOTHING TOO RADICAL.

00:01:29.423 --> 00:01:30.824

YOUR AUTO WITH PASTA,

00:01:37.397 --> 00:01:39.266
THEN PUT IT
IN COACH TEACHER'S OFFICE.

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.803
- [laughs]
HMM, I HAVE TO THINK ABOUT IT.

00:01:42.836 --> 00:01:44.238
- DON'T BE SUCH A HEN,
EH, WHEELS?

00:01:44.271 --> 00:01:47.107

BUT WHERE ARE WE GOING?

00:01:52.112 --> 00:01:54.114
- RIGHT THERE.

00:01:54.114 --> 00:01:56.783
- IT SEEMS LIKE A BIT
OF A DANGEROUS NEIGHBORHOOD, NO?

00:01:56.817 --> 00:01:59.119
- I'LL BE FINE.
I'M A REAL RAPPER NOW.

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:01.755
- YEAH, I JUST FEEL LIKE THERE'S
SOME ROTTEN PEARS MAYBE.

00:02:01.788 --> 00:02:02.823
- IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE
SUCH A HEN ABOUT IT,

00:02:02.856 --> 00:02:04.358
YOU DON'T HAVE TO COME IN.

00:02:04.391 --> 00:02:06.059
- I'M NOT BEING HEN ABOUT IT.

00:02:06.059 --> 00:02:07.628
I JUST CARE ABOUT YOUR SAFETY.

00:02:07.661 --> 00:02:10.063
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
I'LL BE FINE.

00:02:10.097 --> 00:02:12.099
- FINE, THEN.
WHY DON'T YOU JUST GET OUT?

00:02:12.132 --> 00:02:14.067
- I NEED MY CHAIR, MIKEY.

00:02:14.067 --> 00:02:16.970
