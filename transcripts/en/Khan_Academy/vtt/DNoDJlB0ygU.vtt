00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:02.240
In the last video,
I realized that I

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:05.866
made a mistake near the end,
but it's not a good one,

00:00:05.866 --> 00:00:07.490
because I copied down
the wrong number.

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:09.323
And then that led to
the rest of the problem

00:00:09.323 --> 00:00:10.660
not having the right values.

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:12.910
We figured out that
the vertical component

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:14.970
of our velocity
earlier in the video

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:20.360
is negative 26.03
meters per second.

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:22.775
But then something
happened in my brain,

00:00:22.775 --> 00:00:25.450
and it became negative 29.03.

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:27.930
So this is not negative 29.03.

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.479
This is negative 26.03
meters per second.

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:38.502
So the total velocity, we should
have 26.03 squared over here.

00:00:38.502 --> 00:00:40.210
And then if we evaluate
that-- and I just

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:44.249
did it on my calculator--
26.03 squared plus 5.61.

00:00:44.249 --> 00:00:45.540
Actually, I did it wrong again.

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:46.360
So it's 5.21.

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.340
Let me redo it.

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:55.670
So 26.03 squared plus 5.21
squared under the radical

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.240
gives us 26.55.

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:04.769
So this right over here should
be 26.55 meters per second.

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:11.950
So that is the magnitude
of our final velocity.

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:15.580
So that is the magnitude of
our total final velocity.

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:20.980
And the angle, since this
is not 29.03, this is 26.03,

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:30.110
we can say that the tangent
of this angle theta-- this

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:32.540
is this value right
over here-- is

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:36.490
equal to the length of this
vector right over here,

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:41.220
which is the opposite side 26.03
over the length of this vector

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.910
here, which is 5.21.

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:47.820
Or we could say, if we
take the inverse tangent

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.360
of both sides of
this, that the angle

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.640
is equal to the inverse
tangent or the arctangent,

00:01:53.640 --> 00:02:00.370
of 26.03 over 5.21.

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:06.080
We have the inverse
tangent of 26.03

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:14.660
divided by 5.21 gives
us roughly 78.7 degrees.

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:20.180
So the angle here
is 78.7 degrees.

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.510
And it's below the horizontal.

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:27.080
So we can say that the vector,
the final velocity vector,

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:31.500
has a magnitude of
26.55 meters per second

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:36.004
at a direction of 78.7
degrees below the horizontal.

00:02:36.004 --> 00:02:37.420
So I hope I didn't
confuse you too

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:40.950
much with that mistake
at the end of that video.
