00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.790
I love my drive through coffee in the morning
as much as the next gal, but the cup it comes

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:04.790
in?

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:05.790
Not so much.

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:06.970
It could stay in landfill FOREVER.

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:14.719
But hey maybe the early worm gets the disposable
foam.

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:16.320
Hey guys Julia here for DNews

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:17.320
Plastic can be great.

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.080
It’s durable, flexible, and used in everything
from medical equipment to floss, to the cup

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:22.550
my coffee comes in.

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:26.470
Buuuut, unfortunately, most plastics either
don’t or take a very long time to break

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:27.470
down.

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.050
Most plastics are made from processes like
heating up petroleum, this rearranges the

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.310
molecules so it becomes polypropylene, forged
together by strong carbon-carbon bonds.

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:40.110
These strong bonds are hard to break apart,
and because it takes a lot of energy to make

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.010
molecules like polypropylene, nature doesn’t
break them down by itself.

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.620
Kenneth Peters, an organic geochemist at Stanford
University, told LiveScience that "Nature

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:51.890
doesn't make things like that, so organisms
have never seen that before."

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:53.240
But we seem addicted to the stuff.

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:57.750
It makes things cheap and disposable and makes
getting your morning cup of joe a little easier.

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.420
Speaking of those cups of coffee, they are
one of the worst offenders!

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.190
While great at holding hot coffee, it’s
terrible at breaking down.

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:07.880
It could sit there in a landfill for thousands
of years.

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:12.180
But there is some good news two studies published
in the journal Environmental Science and Technology

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.070
suggest the creepy mealworm is to the rescue!

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:18.510
The researchers found that the mealworm has
microbes in their guts that can break down

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:19.510
the foam.

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:20.510
How?

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:22.270
Well by feeding them nothing but the nasty
stuff.

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:26.560
But they're not big eaters, 100 worms ate
about 34 and 39 milligrams a day!

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.060
Okay that’s really not that much.

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.159
But still, it’s better than nothing.

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:33.821
After digesting the stuff the worms released
half as carbon dioxide and pooped out the

00:01:33.821 --> 00:01:35.650
other half as little pellets.

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:38.909
Early results say that the pellets might safe
enough to use as soil!

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.760
WHAT WAY COOL.

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:42.120
Still preliminary though.

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:45.590
Earlier studies also published in the journal
Environmental Science &amp; Technology found other

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:46.970
microbes that could help.

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:50.729
These microbes live in the guts of another
worm, the waxworm which is a moth larva.

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.760
These microbes chow down on polyethylene,
the most common plastic; it's often used in

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:55.760
packaging.

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:59.100
But these worms aren’t alone in their dining
habits, there’s a fungus in the rainforests

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.570
in Ecuador that can eat only plastic.

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:05.870
Described in the journal Applied and Environmental
Microbiology, the fungus Pestalotiopsis microspora

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:07.850
could survive on polyurethane alone.

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:11.480
And the researchers say there could be loads
of other fungus species that could be great

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.940
bioremediation candidates, but we just haven’t
found them yet.

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.640
The only problem though is we’re losing
precious rainforest at five thousand kilometers

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:19.640
a year.

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.580
So we might not have enough time to find the
fungus we need.

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.910
But maybe mother nature doesn’t have all
the answers.

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:27.660
To take down something man-made, maybe we
have to give mother nature a hand.

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.030
For the past ten years, MIT hosts a competition
that encourages students to design a living

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:33.030
cell.

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:34.700
Yeah, you heard that right, design.

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.120
Every year students from all over their world
try their hand at genetic engineering in The

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.959
International Genetically Engineered Machine
(iGEM) Competition.

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:46.030
While not all students try to make bacteria
that eats plastic, in 2013 a group of students

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:50.280
at UC Davis tried creating a bacteria that
would eat a type of plastic called PET.

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.770
But genetic engineering can be controversial.

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:54.240
What happens if you release it into the wild?

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:57.910
We don’t know if or how the new organism
might mutate, or how if it could become an

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:58.980
invasive species.

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.880
And as for more “natural” bacteria it’s
not a silver bullet solution.

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:07.510
We should be very cautious before we go spraying
bacteria and fungus over everything plastic.

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:10.750
We have no idea how these kinds of organisms
could handle a new environment.

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:12.770
There’s a real fear they could TAKE OVER.

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:14.560
Like the fungus from the rainforest?

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.591
Yeah it’s known to cause “rot and disease
in a wide variety of plant species”, not

00:03:18.591 --> 00:03:20.770
good if it gets loose across the planet.

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:24.780
So it’s clear more research is needed, but
researchers are on the right track.

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:28.410
Until a perfect solution is found, maybe we
should keep plastic out of landfills and out

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:32.090
of the environment with the old standby of
reduce, reuse and recycle.

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:33.790
But the other question is, does it really
help?

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:37.120
We are told every day that we should be recycling,
but why?

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.620
What happens to plastic bottles when they’re
not recycled?

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:51.709
Amy’s got the answers in this video right
here.

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:58.129
So what do you think about plastic eating
animals?

00:03:58.129 --> 00:03:59.530
Let me down in the comments below
