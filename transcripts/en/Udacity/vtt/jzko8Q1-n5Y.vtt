00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:04.410
The content in this nano degree will
help you learn the most important

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:06.820
devops, concepts and practices.

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:11.520
You will have many chances to apply what
you have learned by completing projects

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:12.340
and getting feedback.

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:16.600
But you are probably much more
interested in knowing how that will help

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:20.100
you do your job better or
maybe you want to get a better job.

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:23.780
This is where your very
first project comes in.

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:26.870
What does it mean to work better?

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:30.430
How do you measure
the success of a project?

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:33.610
To see improvement,
you need to know what to measure and

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:35.790
then you need to measure
changes over time.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.538
Right now, we are not talking about
monitoring server CPU load or

00:00:41.538 --> 00:00:44.030
measuring click-through rates.

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.470
We're talking about what you want to
improve in your everyday work and

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:50.010
how you can measure improvement in that.

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.860
That's the first step towards
the goal of continuous improvement.

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:58.100
Your task for
the first project will be to identify

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:03.120
problems that you face at your job,
both organizational and technical.

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.000
How do you know that these are problems?

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.830
What would an ideal scenario look like?

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.480
How will you know that
things are changing,

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:16.080
either for the better or for the worse?

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.600
This project will be a living document,
you will start it

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:25.450
now at the very beginning of the program
and you can update it as you continue.

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.320
You can mark the areas where
you don't have the knowledge or

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.120
resources to find a solution.

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:35.090
After you have learned a bit more,
you can revisit those sections.

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:38.820
And if you don't have an organization
to think about, don't worry.

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.760
Maybe you are just between jobs or
just starting your career.

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:45.670
We will provide a story about
a fictional company that you can use for

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:47.920
this project, if you'd like.

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:49.930
Before you get started on your project,

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:52.210
let's look at some general
issues companies face.

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.550
Then we'll look at specific issues with
our fictional and very troubled company.
