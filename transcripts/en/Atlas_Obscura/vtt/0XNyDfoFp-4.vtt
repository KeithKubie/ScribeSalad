00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.875
In the Pacific Ocean between Australia and New Zealand

00:00:02.875 --> 00:00:07.667
is a barren sea spire that is home to the worlds rarest insect

00:00:07.667 --> 00:00:10.875
and what an insect it is!

00:00:15.375 --> 00:00:16.667
This is Ball’s Pyramid

00:00:16.667 --> 00:00:22.542
It is 1843 feet tall, it's 50% taller than the Empire State Building

00:00:22.542 --> 00:00:25.625
and it juts out of the pacific ocean

00:00:25.625 --> 00:00:27.583
it looks like a super villains lair

00:00:27.583 --> 00:00:31.166
and in a funny way, if you are really afraid of huge insects

00:00:31.166 --> 00:00:32.625
it is a super villains lair

00:00:35.458 --> 00:00:39.834
Meet Dryococelus Australis, more commonly known as the Lord Howe Stick Insect

00:00:39.834 --> 00:00:42.792
but also referred to as the Walking Sausage

00:00:42.792 --> 00:00:44.375
and the Tree Lobster.

00:00:44.375 --> 00:00:48.583
It used to live on Lord Howe Island which is where it got its name.

00:00:48.583 --> 00:00:52.333
It’s a larger island that is about 11 km away from Ball’s Pyramid.

00:00:52.333 --> 00:00:57.000
So in 1918 a ship the SS Makambo ran aground on Lord Howe Island

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.458
Black Rats escaped from the ship and found waiting for them

00:01:01.458 --> 00:01:05.166
a delightful treat, in the form of the Lord Howe Stick Insect

00:01:05.166 --> 00:01:10.208
they’re pretty slow, they’re really big, and they probably taste delicious

00:01:10.208 --> 00:01:11.375
If you’re a rat

00:01:11.375 --> 00:01:15.667
it only took them two years to drive the stick insect to extinction

00:01:15.667 --> 00:01:21.208
by 1920 there was not another report of a living Lord Howe Island Stick Insect.

00:01:21.208 --> 00:01:26.500
So it wasn’t until 2001 that a couple of entomologists finally made it out to Ball’s Pyramid

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.000
to basically prove that the stick insect was extinct

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.959
and they got there and they started looking around

00:01:31.959 --> 00:01:34.375
they came across a single bush

00:01:34.375 --> 00:01:38.667
they discovered living, after 80 years

00:01:38.667 --> 00:01:40.834
of being thought extinct

00:01:40.834 --> 00:01:46.959
the last 24 Lord Howe Island Stick Insects in the world

00:01:46.959 --> 00:01:51.000
the Lord Howe Stick Insect was back from the dead

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.500
and they all live under one tiny bush

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:58.166
on the side of Ball’s Pyramid in the middle of the Pacific Ocean

00:01:58.166 --> 00:01:59.959
once they discovered these insects

00:01:59.959 --> 00:02:02.291
they wanted to start a breeding program

00:02:02.291 --> 00:02:06.166
they took four of these stick insects, two of them died in the first week

00:02:06.166 --> 00:02:09.083
that left only two, one male and one female

00:02:09.083 --> 00:02:11.583
which they of course named Adam and Eve

00:02:11.583 --> 00:02:15.792
and after some coaxing and near death experiences of Eve

00:02:15.792 --> 00:02:18.709
they were actually able to begin their captive breeding program

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:21.125
they have bred well over a thousand adults

00:02:21.125 --> 00:02:23.250
and twenty thousand eggs at this point

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:28.917
they are on their way to quite a healthy population of Walking Sausages

00:02:28.917 --> 00:02:31.166
which led some people to say

00:02:31.166 --> 00:02:34.250
It’s a real walking sausage party in here

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:39.041
so after surviving for 80 years in isolation on Ball’s Pyramid

00:02:39.041 --> 00:02:43.458
the stick insect is finally going to be reintroduced to it’s island home

00:02:43.458 --> 00:02:47.083
whether the locals of the island will be pleased to replace their rats

00:02:47.083 --> 00:02:51.709
with equally large nocturnal stick insects  remains to be seen

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:57.417
there is something to be said about being proud of your local species

00:02:57.417 --> 00:03:00.166
however terrifying they may be

00:03:00.166 --> 00:03:05.291

00:03:05.291 --> 00:03:13.166
unusually for insects they form bonded mating pairs, one male and one female

00:03:13.166 --> 00:03:18.291
and when they sleep the male cuddles the female big spoon style

00:03:18.291 --> 00:03:19.458
it’s really nice

00:03:19.458 --> 00:03:23.125
I want to hear what other nicknames you think this wonderful creature should have

00:03:23.125 --> 00:03:26.583
I think Tree Lobster and Walking Sausage are pretty good

00:03:26.583 --> 00:03:28.000
so let me know in the comments

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000
what you think we should calling the Lord Howe Stick Insect
