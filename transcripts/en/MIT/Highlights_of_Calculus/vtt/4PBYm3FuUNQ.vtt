00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:12.710
PROFESSOR: OK, this lecture,
this day, is differential

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:15.350
equations day.

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:22.380
I just feel even though these
are not on the BC exams, that

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.140
we've got everything
we need to actually

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.670
see calculus in use.

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:31.910
We've got the derivatives of
the key functions and ready

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:34.050
for a differential equation.

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.710
And there it is.

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:38.460
When I look at that equation--

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.830
so it's a differential equation
because it has the

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:46.700
derivatives of y as well as
y itself in the equation.

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:52.740
And when I look at it, I see
it's a second order equation

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:55.610
because there's a second
derivative.

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:03.140
It's a linear equation because
second derivative, first

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.660
derivative, and y itself are
separate, no multiplying of y

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:09.490
times y prime.

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:12.030
In fact, the only
multiplications are by these

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:19.440
numbers m, r and k, and those
are constant numbers coming

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.610
from the application.

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:25.120
So I have a constant
coefficient, linear, second

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:29.680
order, differential equation,
and I'd like to solve it.

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:34.080
And we can do it because it uses
the very functions that

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.880
we know how to find
derivatives of.

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.580
Let me take two or three special
cases where those

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.550
functions appear purely.

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:46.640
So one special case is if
I knock out the second

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:52.450
derivative term, and let
me just choose--

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:59.410
rewrite it in the way it looks
easiest and best. It's just

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:02.260
the derivative of y as
some multiple of y.

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:07.000
It's now first order, and we
know the function that solves

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.889
that equation.

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:12.130
When the derivative equals the
function itself, that's the

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:13.640
exponential.

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.120
If I want to have an extra
factor a here, then I

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.680
need e to the at.

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:31.270
And usually, in fact, we expect
that with a first order

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:34.860
equation, in the solution
there'll be some constant that

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:38.770
we can set later to match
the starting condition.

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:41.340
And that constant
shows up here.

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.730
It's just if e to the at solves
that equation, as it

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.830
does, because when I take the
derivative, down comes on a,

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.520
so does c times e to the at.

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:56.790
That's because the equation
is linear.

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.520
So that's a nice one.

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:00.720
Pure exponential.

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.020
OK, ready for this one.

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:07.700
So this one, I don't have
this middle term.

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:10.860
I just have the second
derivative and the function.

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:17.400
And let me again change to
letters I like, putting the ky

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.490
on the other side with
a minus sign.

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:33.290
So this omega squared
will be k/m when I

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:35.260
reorganize that equation.

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:40.580
My point is we can solve this
equation, the second

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:45.080
derivative equaling minus
the function.

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:46.740
We've met that.

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:49.600
That's this equation
that the sine and

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:52.640
the cosine both solve.

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:57.320
There we get two solutions for
this second order equation.

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:01.170
And just as with the a in this
problem, so with this number

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:04.780
here, I'll just jiggle the sine
and the cosine a little

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:11.570
bit so that we get omega to come
down twice when I take

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:13.040
two derivatives.

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:17.269
So the solution here will be--

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:23.570
one solution will be the cosine
of omega t because two

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:26.670
derivatives of the cosine
is minus the cosine--

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:28.240
that's what this asks for--

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:31.320
with the factor omega
coming out twice.

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:37.400
And another solution will
be sine of omega t

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:39.040
for the same reason.

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:43.250
And again, now with a second
order equation, I'm expecting

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:46.520
a couple of constants to be
able to choose later.

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:53.170
And here they are: c cosine
omega t and d sine omega t.

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:57.300
That's the general solution
to that equation.

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:59.120
So we know that.

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:01.820
And these are the two
important ones.

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:03.870
There's another less important
one and an

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:05.560
extremely simple one.

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:10.530
Suppose all that went away, and
I just had as a third very

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:14.695
special case d second y
dt squared equals 0.

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:20.930
We sure know the solution
to that.

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:25.220
What functions have second
derivative equals 0?

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:27.300
Well, a constant function
does, certainly.

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:32.610
A constant, even its first
derivative is 0

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:34.130
much less its second.

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:39.690
And then t does.

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:42.520
Its first derivative is
1 and then the second

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:43.760
derivative is 0.

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:48.660
So there show up the
powers of t.

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:52.770
Well, the first two powers, t to
the 0 and t to the 1, show

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:56.120
up in that very special case.

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:58.360
Sine and cosine show up here.

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:00.200
e to the at shows up here.

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:04.300
And now let me tell you the
good part of this lecture.

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:09.190
The solution to this equation
and in fact to equations of

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:15.790
third, fourth, all orders, are
products of these ones that we

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:22.900
know: exponentials times sines
and cosines times powers of t.

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:26.020
That's all we need to solve
constant coefficient

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:27.580
differential equations.

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:31.290
So I plan now to go ahead
and solve the--

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:36.580
and move toward this equation.

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:40.950
I should have said that's a
fundamental equation of

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:42.760
engineering.

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:44.990
m stands for some mass.

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:48.090
Oh yeah, let me draw a picture,
and you'll see why I

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:54.070
chose to choose t rather than
x, because things are

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:55.670
happening in time.

00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:57.270
And what is happening?

00:06:57.270 --> 00:06:58.570
Let me show you.

00:06:58.570 --> 00:07:01.990
What's happening in time is
typically this would be a

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:09.380
problem with us some kind of a
spring hanging down, and on

00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:11.870
that spring is a mass m.

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:20.740
OK, so what happens if I--

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:24.650
I've pulled that mass down, so
I've stretched the spring, and

00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:27.020
then I let go.

00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:29.410
Then what does the spring do?

00:07:29.410 --> 00:07:34.400
Well, the spring will pull the
mass back upwards, and it will

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:39.920
pull it back up to the point
where it squeezes, compresses

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:40.590
the spring.

00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:42.420
The spring will be--

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:43.980
like instead of being
stretched out,

00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:45.350
it'll be the opposite.

00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:47.140
It'll be compressed in.

00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:51.430
And then when compressed in,
it'll push the mass.

00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:53.820
Being compressed, the
spring will push.

00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:59.140
It'll push the mass down again
and up again, and I get

00:07:59.140 --> 00:08:01.030
oscillation.

00:08:01.030 --> 00:08:04.130
Oscillation is what
I'm seeing here.

00:08:04.130 --> 00:08:09.963
And what are examples of
oscillation in real life?

00:08:09.963 --> 00:08:20.640
The spring or a clock,
especially a grandfather clock

00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:24.060
that's swinging back and forth,
back and forth, so I'll

00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:25.310
just put a clock.

00:08:29.290 --> 00:08:32.710
Music, a violin string
is oscillating.

00:08:32.710 --> 00:08:36.015
That's where the beautiful
sound comes from.

00:08:39.626 --> 00:08:44.390
Our heart is in and out,
in and out, a regular

00:08:44.390 --> 00:08:45.640
oscillation.

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:52.310
I could add molecules.

00:08:52.310 --> 00:08:55.520
They oscillate extremely
quickly.

00:08:55.520 --> 00:09:02.780
So this equation that I'm
aiming for comes up in

00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:05.310
biology, in chemistry--

00:09:05.310 --> 00:09:08.490
for molecules, it's a very
important equation--

00:09:08.490 --> 00:09:13.400
in physics and mechanics and
engineering for springs.

00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:14.870
It comes up in economics.

00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:17.250
It's everywhere.

00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:21.940
And by choosing constant
coefficients, I have the basic

00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:24.430
model and the simplest model.

00:09:24.430 --> 00:09:29.880
OK, so I'll talk in this
language of springs, but it's

00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:34.420
all these oscillations that lead
to equations like that.

00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:42.300
Actually, this model often
would have r equals 0.

00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:46.920
So let me take that case
r equals 0 again.

00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:50.030
So where does the equation
come from?

00:09:50.030 --> 00:09:55.270
Can I do two cents worth of
physics and then go back to

00:09:55.270 --> 00:09:57.880
the math, solving
the equation.

00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:00.400
The physics is just remembering
Newton's

00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:02.431
Law: f equals ma.

00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:07.970
So there is the m, the mass.

00:10:07.970 --> 00:10:10.690
The a is the acceleration.

00:10:10.690 --> 00:10:12.920
That's the second derivative,
right?

00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:16.175
You don't mind if I write that
as second derivative.

00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:22.390
Acceleration, the mass
is constant.

00:10:22.390 --> 00:10:28.490
We're not going at the speed of
light here so we can assume

00:10:28.490 --> 00:10:30.880
that mass is not being
converted to energy.

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:32.290
It's mass.

00:10:32.290 --> 00:10:34.150
And then what's the force?

00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:36.460
Well, for this spring
force, for this

00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:39.180
spring, what did we say?

00:10:41.950 --> 00:10:44.380
So y is going this way.

00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:49.690
It's the disposition, the
displacement of the spring.

00:10:49.690 --> 00:10:56.620
When it's down like that, when
y is positive, the spring is

00:10:56.620 --> 00:10:59.200
pulling back.

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:01.540
The force from the spring
is pulling back.

00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:05.830
And the force from the spring
is proportional to y.

00:11:05.830 --> 00:11:11.570
And the proportionality constant
is my number k.

00:11:11.570 --> 00:11:14.360
That fact that I
just said is--

00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:21.400
and I guess it's pulling
opposite to a positive y.

00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:27.450
When y is positive, and this
spring is way down, the force

00:11:27.450 --> 00:11:28.990
is pulling it up,
pulling in the

00:11:28.990 --> 00:11:30.970
negative direction, upwards.

00:11:30.970 --> 00:11:33.510
So I need that minus sign.

00:11:33.510 --> 00:11:38.540
So that k is the stiffness
of the spring.

00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:42.120
This is Hooke's Law, that the
force coming from a spring is

00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:46.260
proportional to the stretch.

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:50.610
And the constant in there is
Hooke's constant, the spring

00:11:50.610 --> 00:11:52.400
constant k.

00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:56.570
So now that if I put the minus
ky over there as plus ky, you

00:11:56.570 --> 00:11:58.820
see my equation again.

00:11:58.820 --> 00:12:03.756
But this is the one that we were
able to solve right here.

00:12:03.756 --> 00:12:10.070
Do you see that this is the
case where r is 0 in this

00:12:10.070 --> 00:12:11.870
first model?

00:12:11.870 --> 00:12:19.150
r is 0 because r involves
resistance: r for resistance,

00:12:19.150 --> 00:12:21.376
air resistance, damping.

00:12:21.376 --> 00:12:25.090
And right now, I don't
have that.

00:12:25.090 --> 00:12:28.340
I just have a little spring
that'll oscillate forever.

00:12:28.340 --> 00:12:34.080
It'll oscillate forever
following sine and cosine.

00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:35.950
That's exactly what the
spring will do.

00:12:35.950 --> 00:12:39.800
It will just go on forever,
and the c and the d, their

00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:43.640
constants, will depend
on how it started.

00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:46.060
Did it start from rest?

00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:51.630
If it started from rest, there
would be no sine term.

00:12:51.630 --> 00:12:53.980
It's easy to find
c and d later.

00:12:53.980 --> 00:12:57.210
The real problem is to solve the
equation, and we've done

00:12:57.210 --> 00:12:58.820
it for this equation.

00:13:01.330 --> 00:13:03.940
OK, and let's just
remember this.

00:13:03.940 --> 00:13:08.950
Let me repeat that when I put
that onto the other side and

00:13:08.950 --> 00:13:13.400
divide by k, then I see the--
oh, divided by m, sorry--

00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:15.210
then I see the omega squared.

00:13:15.210 --> 00:13:19.790
So omega squared is k/m.

00:13:19.790 --> 00:13:21.580
Right.

00:13:21.580 --> 00:13:24.590
Oh, it is k/m, right.

00:13:24.590 --> 00:13:29.130
OK, that's the simple case,
pure sines and cosines.

00:13:29.130 --> 00:13:33.130
Now I'm letting in
some resistance.

00:13:33.130 --> 00:13:35.370
So now I'm coming back
to my equation.

00:13:35.370 --> 00:13:36.930
Let me write it again.

00:13:36.930 --> 00:13:39.770
m y double prime--

00:13:39.770 --> 00:13:41.530
second derivative--

00:13:41.530 --> 00:13:44.910
plus 2r y prime--

00:13:44.910 --> 00:13:46.540
first derivative--

00:13:46.540 --> 00:13:48.720
plus ky--

00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:52.290
0-th derivative equals 0.

00:13:52.290 --> 00:13:55.960
I want to solve that equation
now for any

00:13:55.960 --> 00:14:00.510
numbers m and r and k.

00:14:00.510 --> 00:14:08.200
OK, well, the nice thing is that
the exponential function

00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:12.800
takes us right to the answer,
the best plan here.

00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:16.030
So this is the most important
equation you would see in a

00:14:16.030 --> 00:14:17.900
differential equations course.

00:14:17.900 --> 00:14:22.440
And then the course kind of goes
past, and then you easily

00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:26.070
forget this is the most
important and the simplest.

00:14:26.070 --> 00:14:27.160
Why is it simple?

00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:30.230
Because if the key idea--

00:14:30.230 --> 00:14:36.125
this is the key idea: try
y equals e to the--

00:14:36.125 --> 00:14:40.140
an exponential e to the
something times t.

00:14:40.140 --> 00:14:43.150
Let me call that something
lambda.

00:14:43.150 --> 00:14:45.120
You might have preferred c.

00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:48.460
I'm happy with c or any
other number there.

00:14:48.460 --> 00:14:52.685
Yeah, OK, I'll call that lambda,
just because it gives

00:14:52.685 --> 00:14:54.570
it a little Greek importance.

00:14:54.570 --> 00:14:57.170
All right, so I try this.

00:14:57.170 --> 00:15:01.180
I substitute that into the
equation, and I'm going to

00:15:01.180 --> 00:15:04.110
choose lambda to make
things work.

00:15:04.110 --> 00:15:07.160
OK, but here's the key.

00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:09.000
The key idea is so easy.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:10.760
Now, put it into the equation.

00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:13.220
So what happens when I put--

00:15:13.220 --> 00:15:16.100
when this is y, take
two derivatives.

00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:18.800
Well, let me start with
taking no derivatives.

00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:23.500
So I have down here the k
e to the lambda t, and

00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:25.170
over here is a 0.

00:15:25.170 --> 00:15:29.160
And now let me back up to
the first derivative.

00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:33.650
So that's 2r times
the derivative

00:15:33.650 --> 00:15:35.460
of this guy y prime.

00:15:35.460 --> 00:15:38.940
I'm just substituting this
into the equation.

00:15:38.940 --> 00:15:41.480
So what's the derivative?

00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:45.360
We know that the derivative of
this brings down the lambda.

00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:46.680
We already did it.

00:15:46.680 --> 00:15:50.130
lambda e to the lambda
t, right?

00:15:50.130 --> 00:15:51.770
That's the derivative.

00:15:51.770 --> 00:15:53.550
And what about this one?

00:15:53.550 --> 00:15:57.980
This one is going to be
an m y double prime.

00:15:57.980 --> 00:16:00.520
What happens with
two derivatives?

00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:05.160
Bring down lambda twice, two
times, so I have lambda

00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:09.140
squared e to the lambda t.

00:16:09.140 --> 00:16:14.430
And then in a minute, you know
what I'm going to do.

00:16:14.430 --> 00:16:18.900
I'm going to cancel that common
factor e to the lambda

00:16:18.900 --> 00:16:24.140
t, which is never 0 so I can
safely divide it out, and then

00:16:24.140 --> 00:16:26.690
write the equation we get.

00:16:26.690 --> 00:16:29.470
OK, let me write that out
more with more space.

00:16:29.470 --> 00:16:36.260
m lambda squared plus
2r lambda--

00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:37.230
taking that--

00:16:37.230 --> 00:16:41.435
plus k is 0.

00:16:44.140 --> 00:16:48.120
This is the equation.

00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:51.640
It's just an ordinary
quadratic equation.

00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:55.730
It's a high school
algebra equation.

00:16:55.730 --> 00:16:59.740
Lambda appears squared because
we had two derivatives.

00:16:59.740 --> 00:17:03.920
We had a second derivative, and
so I need the quadratic

00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:06.130
formula to know--

00:17:06.130 --> 00:17:09.410
I expect two answers,
two lambdas.

00:17:09.410 --> 00:17:14.220
And that's normal for a second
order equation, and I'll get

00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:19.329
two solutions: e to the lambda
1t and e to the lambda 2t.

00:17:19.329 --> 00:17:23.750
Two different exponentials will
both solve the problem.

00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:27.560
All right, what's the lambda?

00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:31.380
Well, can I just recall
the quadratic formula?

00:17:31.380 --> 00:17:35.160
Well, it's a little messy, but
it's not too bad here, just to

00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:39.280
show that I remember it.

00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:42.770
And the 2 there is kind of
handy with the quadratic

00:17:42.770 --> 00:17:47.730
formula because then I just get
minus an r plus or minus

00:17:47.730 --> 00:17:51.370
the square root of r squared.

00:17:51.370 --> 00:17:55.830
And it's not minus 4km, but
because of the 2 there, it's

00:17:55.830 --> 00:17:57.080
just minus km.

00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:04.680
And then I divide by m.

00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:10.280
OK, well, big deal.

00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:12.710
I get two roots.

00:18:12.710 --> 00:18:14.280
Let me use numbers.

00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:19.020
So what you see there
is like solving the

00:18:19.020 --> 00:18:20.860
differential equation.

00:18:20.860 --> 00:18:22.410
Not too bad.

00:18:22.410 --> 00:18:27.990
Now let me put in numbers to
show what's typical, and, of

00:18:27.990 --> 00:18:31.200
course, as those numbers
change, we'll

00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:35.710
see different lambdas.

00:18:35.710 --> 00:18:38.820
And actually, as the numbers
change, that will take us

00:18:38.820 --> 00:18:44.330
between the exponential stuff
and the oscillating stuff.

00:18:44.330 --> 00:18:48.270
All right, let me take one
where I think it start--

00:18:48.270 --> 00:18:50.770
I think this will be-- so
this is example one.

00:18:54.310 --> 00:19:01.640
I'll choose m equal 1 y
double prime plus--

00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:07.110
let me take r to be 3, so
then I have 6y prime.

00:19:07.110 --> 00:19:13.260
And let me choose k
to be 8y equals 0.

00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:15.370
All right, now we've
got numbers.

00:19:19.050 --> 00:19:25.690
So the numbers are m equals
1, r equals 3, k equals 8.

00:19:25.690 --> 00:19:30.740
And I claim we can write the
solution to that equation, or

00:19:30.740 --> 00:19:33.850
the two solutions, because there
will be two lambdas.

00:19:33.850 --> 00:19:40.400
OK, so when I try e to the
lambda t, plug it in, I'll get

00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:46.220
lambda twice, and then I'll get
6 lambda once, and then

00:19:46.220 --> 00:19:50.510
I'll get 8 without a lambda
coming down, all multiplied by

00:19:50.510 --> 00:19:53.540
e to the lambda t, which I'm
canceling, equals 0.

00:19:56.090 --> 00:20:03.000
So I solve that equation either
directly by recognizing

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:07.960
that it factors into lambda
plus 2 times lambda plus 4

00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:13.310
equals 0 or by plugging
in r and k and m in

00:20:13.310 --> 00:20:14.640
the quadratic formula.

00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:22.450
Either way, I'm learning that
lambda is minus 2 or minus 4.

00:20:22.450 --> 00:20:24.720
Those are the two solutions.

00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:29.330
The two decay rates, you could
call them, because they're up

00:20:29.330 --> 00:20:30.820
in the exponent.

00:20:30.820 --> 00:20:32.140
So what's the solution?

00:20:32.140 --> 00:20:39.670
y of t, the solution to that
equation, the general solution

00:20:39.670 --> 00:20:45.370
with a constant c and a constant
d is an e to the

00:20:45.370 --> 00:20:52.680
minus 2t and an e
to the minus 4t.

00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:58.960
The two lambdas are in the
exponent, and we've solved it.

00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:01.190
So that's the point.

00:21:01.190 --> 00:21:07.380
We have the ability to solve
differential equations based

00:21:07.380 --> 00:21:12.560
on the three most important
derivatives we know:

00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:16.590
exponential, sines-cosines,
powers of t.

00:21:16.590 --> 00:21:19.070
OK, ready for example two?

00:21:19.070 --> 00:21:23.370
Example two, I'm just going to
change that 8 to a 10, so

00:21:23.370 --> 00:21:26.280
you're going to see
a 10 show up here.

00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:27.915
All right, but that will
make a difference.

00:21:27.915 --> 00:21:30.460
It won't just be some
new numbers.

00:21:30.460 --> 00:21:33.410
There'll be a definite
difference here.

00:21:33.410 --> 00:21:38.630
OK, let me go over across
here to the one with 10.

00:21:38.630 --> 00:21:46.210
OK, so now my equation is 1y
double prime, 6y prime still,

00:21:46.210 --> 00:21:51.660
and now 10y is equals to 0,
remembering prime means

00:21:51.660 --> 00:21:53.220
derivative.

00:21:53.220 --> 00:21:58.470
OK, so again, I try y is
e to the lambda t.

00:21:58.470 --> 00:21:59.940
I plug it in.

00:21:59.940 --> 00:22:03.290
When I have two derivatives,
bring down lambda squared.

00:22:03.290 --> 00:22:06.140
One derivative brings
down lambda.

00:22:06.140 --> 00:22:09.930
No derivatives leaves
the 10, equals 0.

00:22:09.930 --> 00:22:13.860
That's my equation for lambda.

00:22:13.860 --> 00:22:14.870
Ha!

00:22:14.870 --> 00:22:17.730
I don't know how to
factor that one.

00:22:17.730 --> 00:22:24.930
And in fact, I better use the
quadratic formula just to show

00:22:24.930 --> 00:22:26.420
what happens here.

00:22:26.420 --> 00:22:31.350
So the quadratic formula will
be the two roots lambda.

00:22:35.580 --> 00:22:38.500
Can I remember that
dumb formula?

00:22:38.500 --> 00:22:43.290
Minus r plus or minus the square
root of r squared minus

00:22:43.290 --> 00:22:47.010
km, all divided by m.

00:22:47.010 --> 00:22:51.690
I got the 2's and the
4's out of it by

00:22:51.690 --> 00:22:54.080
taking r to be 3 here.

00:22:54.080 --> 00:23:01.850
OK, so it's minus 3 plus or
minus the square root of r

00:23:01.850 --> 00:23:07.820
squared is 9 minus 1 times 10.

00:23:07.820 --> 00:23:13.394
k and m is 10 divided by 1.

00:23:13.394 --> 00:23:15.270
Ha!

00:23:15.270 --> 00:23:18.570
You see something different's
going on here.

00:23:18.570 --> 00:23:22.240
I have the square root
of a negative number.

00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:27.430
Over there, if I wrote out that
square root, you would

00:23:27.430 --> 00:23:30.910
have seen the square
root of plus 1.

00:23:30.910 --> 00:23:34.900
That gave me minus 3 plus
1 or minus 3 minus 1.

00:23:34.900 --> 00:23:37.870
That was the minus
2 and minus 4.

00:23:37.870 --> 00:23:39.870
Now I'm different.

00:23:39.870 --> 00:23:45.020
Now seeing the square root of
minus 1, so this is minus 3

00:23:45.020 --> 00:23:46.920
plus or minus i.

00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:52.460
So I see the solution y of t.

00:23:52.460 --> 00:23:57.645
You see, this is i here, the
square root of minus 1.

00:24:02.110 --> 00:24:04.610
We can deal with that.

00:24:04.610 --> 00:24:07.800
It's a complex number,
an imaginary number.

00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:11.600
And the combination minus 3 plus
i is a complex number,

00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:14.690
and we have to accept that
that's our lambda.

00:24:14.690 --> 00:24:20.760
So I have any multiple of c,
and the lambda here is

00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:26.060
minus 3 plus i t.

00:24:26.060 --> 00:24:33.980
And the second solution is
e minus 3 minus i t.

00:24:38.290 --> 00:24:39.560
I found the general solution.

00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:48.770
We could say done, except you
might feel, well, how did

00:24:48.770 --> 00:24:49.660
imaginary--

00:24:49.660 --> 00:24:53.040
what are we going to do with
these imaginary numbers here?

00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:55.460
How did they get in this
perfectly real

00:24:55.460 --> 00:24:57.210
differential equation?

00:24:57.210 --> 00:25:01.360
Well, they slipped in because
the solutions

00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:03.110
were not real numbers.

00:25:03.110 --> 00:25:06.560
The solutions were minus
3 plus or minus i.

00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:10.290
But we can get real again.

00:25:10.290 --> 00:25:14.330
So this is one way to write the
answer, but I just want to

00:25:14.330 --> 00:25:20.870
show you using the earlier
lecture, using the beautiful

00:25:20.870 --> 00:25:24.660
fact that Euler discovered.

00:25:24.660 --> 00:25:29.350
So now let me complete this
example by remembering Euler's

00:25:29.350 --> 00:25:32.870
great formula for e to the it.

00:25:32.870 --> 00:25:37.790
Because you see we have an e
to the minus 3t, perfectly

00:25:37.790 --> 00:25:39.650
real, decaying.

00:25:39.650 --> 00:25:43.950
The spring is slowing down
because of air resistance.

00:25:43.950 --> 00:25:47.910
But we also have
an e to the it.

00:25:47.910 --> 00:25:51.840
That's what Euler's formulas
about and Euler's formula says

00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:57.550
that e to the it is the
cosine of t plus i

00:25:57.550 --> 00:26:01.220
times the sine of t.

00:26:01.220 --> 00:26:04.620
So it's through Euler's
formula that these

00:26:04.620 --> 00:26:06.500
oscillations are coming in.

00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:10.800
The direct method led
to an e to the it.

00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:18.640
But the next day, Euler
realized that e

00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:20.420
to the minus it--

00:26:20.420 --> 00:26:24.970
or probably being Euler, it
didn't take till next day--

00:26:24.970 --> 00:26:29.580
will be minus i sine t.

00:26:29.580 --> 00:26:36.080
So both e to the it and e to
the minus it, they both can

00:26:36.080 --> 00:26:39.780
get replaced by sines
and cosines.

00:26:39.780 --> 00:26:43.460
So in place of e to the
it, I'll put that.

00:26:43.460 --> 00:26:46.080
In place of e to the minus
it, I put that one.

00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:48.160
The final result is--

00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:50.200
can I just jump to that?

00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:54.730
The final result is that with
some different constants, we

00:26:54.730 --> 00:26:56.080
have the cosine--

00:26:56.080 --> 00:26:57.140
oh!

00:26:57.140 --> 00:27:00.700
let me not forget e
to the minus 3t.

00:27:00.700 --> 00:27:03.510
That's part of this answer.

00:27:03.510 --> 00:27:08.010
I'm damping this out by e to the
minus 3t, this resistance

00:27:08.010 --> 00:27:18.990
r, times cosine of t and the e
to the minus 3t sine of t.

00:27:18.990 --> 00:27:21.055
OK, that's good.

00:27:23.630 --> 00:27:29.080
General solution, back
to a real numbers.

00:27:29.080 --> 00:27:32.310
It describes a damped
oscillation.

00:27:32.310 --> 00:27:33.650
It's damped out.

00:27:33.650 --> 00:27:35.290
It's slowing down.

00:27:35.290 --> 00:27:37.780
Rather, it's decaying.

00:27:37.780 --> 00:27:40.940
The amplitude is-- the
spring is like--

00:27:40.940 --> 00:27:43.250
it's like having a shock
absorber or something.

00:27:43.250 --> 00:27:50.760
It's settling down to the center
point pretty fast. But

00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:54.170
as it settles, it's goes back
across that center point,

00:27:54.170 --> 00:27:55.680
oscillates across.

00:27:55.680 --> 00:28:01.250
OK, now you might finally ask,
the last step of this lecture,

00:28:01.250 --> 00:28:06.010
where do powers of t come in?

00:28:06.010 --> 00:28:07.580
Where does t come in?

00:28:07.580 --> 00:28:11.470
So far we've seen exponentials
come in.

00:28:11.470 --> 00:28:14.180
We've seen sines and
cosines come in.

00:28:14.180 --> 00:28:19.090
Can I do a last example just
here in the corner, which will

00:28:19.090 --> 00:28:25.980
be y double prime, 6 y prime,
and now this time instead of 8

00:28:25.980 --> 00:28:31.850
or 10, I'm going to
take 9y equals 0.

00:28:31.850 --> 00:28:38.610
OK, can we use this as example
3, which we can solve?

00:28:38.610 --> 00:28:42.880
You know that I'm going to
try y equals to lambda t.

00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:45.360
Let me substitute that.

00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:49.790
I'll get lambda squared coming
from two derivatives, lambda

00:28:49.790 --> 00:28:55.930
coming from one derivative, 9
coming from no derivatives.

00:28:55.930 --> 00:28:59.400
I've got my quadratic equation
that's supposed

00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:02.210
to give me two lambdas.

00:29:02.210 --> 00:29:03.790
Little problem here.

00:29:03.790 --> 00:29:08.100
When I factor this, it factors
into lambda plus 3

00:29:08.100 --> 00:29:10.900
squared equals 0.

00:29:10.900 --> 00:29:16.440
So the answer, the lambda,
is minus 3 twice.

00:29:19.620 --> 00:29:21.400
Twice!

00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:28.810
The two lambdas happen to hit
the same value: minus 3.

00:29:28.810 --> 00:29:32.730
OK, we don't have any
complex stuff here.

00:29:32.730 --> 00:29:36.790
It's two real values that
happen to coincide.

00:29:36.790 --> 00:29:42.120
And when that happens, well,
minus 3 tells us that a

00:29:42.120 --> 00:29:47.240
solution e to the
minus 3t works.

00:29:47.240 --> 00:29:50.360
Where do we get the
other solution?

00:29:50.360 --> 00:29:54.260
We want two solutions to a
second order equation.

00:29:54.260 --> 00:29:58.040
I can't just use e to
the minus 3t again.

00:29:58.040 --> 00:30:02.580
I need a second solution, and
it shows up at this--

00:30:02.580 --> 00:30:05.560
it's typical of math
that it shows--

00:30:05.560 --> 00:30:08.960
something special happens at
this special situation of a

00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:16.440
double root, and the solutions
will be e to the minus 3t and

00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:19.170
t e to the minus 3t.

00:30:19.170 --> 00:30:22.490
That's the last step, and
maybe I just put it--

00:30:22.490 --> 00:30:25.670
well, where am I going
to put it?

00:30:25.670 --> 00:30:29.120
I'll bring this down and
just put it here.

00:30:29.120 --> 00:30:34.030
So now I'm solving this
particular problem y is a

00:30:34.030 --> 00:30:37.330
multiple of e to the minus 3t.

00:30:37.330 --> 00:30:42.340
Good, but I can't just repeat
it for the second one.

00:30:42.340 --> 00:30:46.160
So the second one, it just turns
out that then is when a

00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:47.490
little factor t appears.

00:30:50.030 --> 00:30:54.760
You might like to substitute
that for practice with the

00:30:54.760 --> 00:30:56.220
product rule.

00:30:56.220 --> 00:30:59.280
If you substitute that in the
differential equation, you'll

00:30:59.280 --> 00:31:04.360
find everything cancels,
and it works.

00:31:04.360 --> 00:31:11.480
So the conclusion is linear
constant coefficient

00:31:11.480 --> 00:31:17.030
differential equations are
completely solved by trying e

00:31:17.030 --> 00:31:22.140
to the lambda t and finding
that number lambda.

00:31:22.140 --> 00:31:25.950
If it's a real number,
we have exponentials.

00:31:25.950 --> 00:31:29.810
If it's an imaginary number,
we have sines and cosines.

00:31:29.810 --> 00:31:33.950
If it's a repeated number,
we have an extra

00:31:33.950 --> 00:31:36.650
factor t showing up.

00:31:36.650 --> 00:31:42.690
That's the exceptional event
in that particular case.

00:31:42.690 --> 00:31:43.890
So there you go.

00:31:43.890 --> 00:31:46.950
Differential equations
with constant

00:31:46.950 --> 00:31:50.140
coefficients we can handle.

00:31:50.140 --> 00:31:52.040
You can handle.

00:31:52.040 --> 00:31:53.290
