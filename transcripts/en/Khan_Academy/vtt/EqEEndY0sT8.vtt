00:00:00.309 --> 00:00:03.377
- [Instructor] As we enter
into the sixth century BCE,

00:00:03.377 --> 00:00:05.182
the dominant power in the region

00:00:05.182 --> 00:00:10.015
that we now refer to as Iran,
it was the Median Empire.

00:00:10.015 --> 00:00:11.282
And the Median Empire...

00:00:11.282 --> 00:00:13.981
I'll draw the rough
border right over here.

00:00:13.981 --> 00:00:15.981
Was something like that.

00:00:18.158 --> 00:00:19.796
And you can see the dominant region

00:00:19.796 --> 00:00:22.211
of Media right over here.

00:00:22.211 --> 00:00:23.480
But, by the middle of that century,

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.076
they are going to be overthrown.

00:00:25.076 --> 00:00:26.757
They're going to be overthrown

00:00:26.757 --> 00:00:29.213
by one of their subject kingdoms.

00:00:29.213 --> 00:00:31.296
And that is the Persians.

00:00:32.406 --> 00:00:33.306
And so, right over here on this map,

00:00:33.306 --> 00:00:37.115
it's called Persis, but that
region is called Pars or Fars.

00:00:37.115 --> 00:00:41.333
And, even today in modern Iran,
that region is called Fars.

00:00:41.333 --> 00:00:44.750
And the king of Pars was Cyrus the Great.

00:00:45.673 --> 00:00:49.840
And, in 550/549 BCE,
he's able to overthrow

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:55.093
the Median emperor, who
happens to be his grandfather,

00:00:55.093 --> 00:00:57.835
and then he establishes what history views

00:00:57.835 --> 00:01:01.152
as the first real Persian empire.

00:01:01.152 --> 00:01:03.605
And the whole reason why we
even call it a Persian empire

00:01:03.605 --> 00:01:07.250
is because Cyrus the Great was from Pars.

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.380
Persian is really
referring to the idea that

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:12.161
the ruler, the dynasty
that gets established,

00:01:12.161 --> 00:01:14.291
was coming from Pars.

00:01:14.291 --> 00:01:16.583
It turns out, and I talk
about in other videos,

00:01:16.583 --> 00:01:21.005
the Persians did not refer
to themselves as Persians.

00:01:21.005 --> 00:01:23.422
They viewed themselves
more as the Aryan people.

00:01:23.422 --> 00:01:27.915
In a lot of ways, Eran or
Iran or Arianum of Asia,

00:01:27.915 --> 00:01:30.153
these types of words are
more accurate for how

00:01:30.153 --> 00:01:33.224
the Persians viewed themselves.

00:01:33.224 --> 00:01:36.297
But, needless to say,
in 549, Cyrus the Great

00:01:36.297 --> 00:01:40.964
is able to conquer the Median
Empire and he keeps going.

00:01:40.964 --> 00:01:44.773
And what he establishes,
this empire, this dynasty,

00:01:44.773 --> 00:01:47.606
is called the Achaemednid Dynasty.

00:01:49.481 --> 00:01:50.314
And you might wonder

00:01:50.314 --> 00:01:52.634
why is it called the Achaemenid Dynasty,

00:01:52.634 --> 00:01:55.419
instead of, say, the Cyrid Dynasty?

00:01:55.419 --> 00:01:57.179
And that's because Cyrus claims

00:01:57.179 --> 00:01:59.759
descendant from Achaemenes.

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.645
He is part of that family.

00:02:01.645 --> 00:02:05.781
Achaemenes is this
semi-legendary patriarch of it

00:02:05.781 --> 00:02:09.672
that lived 100, 150 years
before Cyrus the Great.

00:02:09.672 --> 00:02:13.839
And so, I will draw a dotted
line from Achaemenes to Cyrus.

00:02:15.896 --> 00:02:18.068
And Cyrus then goes on.

00:02:18.068 --> 00:02:21.470
So, he conquers the Median Empire,

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:22.576
then he goes on to conquer

00:02:22.576 --> 00:02:25.688
several of the major empires of that time.

00:02:25.688 --> 00:02:27.688
In the mid-540's BCE....

00:02:29.249 --> 00:02:31.791
So, we are right around there.

00:02:31.791 --> 00:02:35.225
He conquers the Lydian
Empire, right over there,

00:02:35.225 --> 00:02:36.987
which is on the western half of

00:02:36.987 --> 00:02:40.225
the Anatolian Peninsula
in modern day Turkey.

00:02:40.225 --> 00:02:43.621
And then, he sets his sight
on the Neo-Babylonian Empire.

00:02:43.621 --> 00:02:47.788
And, in 539, he's able to conquer
the Neo-Babylonian Empire.

00:02:50.011 --> 00:02:52.717
And, from a Biblical
perspective, that's relevant.

00:02:52.717 --> 00:02:54.475
Because, when he takes Babylon,

00:02:54.475 --> 00:02:57.582
he frees the Jews from
the Babylonian captivity

00:02:57.582 --> 00:03:00.695
and he resettles them in Jerusalem.

00:03:00.695 --> 00:03:03.151
And he works with them to
rebuild the city of Jerusalem

00:03:03.151 --> 00:03:05.155
and, especially, Solomon's Temple,

00:03:05.155 --> 00:03:08.921
which is now called the Second
Temple on the Temple Mount.

00:03:08.921 --> 00:03:10.846
And Cyrus the Great is viewed by history

00:03:10.846 --> 00:03:12.605
as one of the great rulers of all time.

00:03:12.605 --> 00:03:14.939
Often referred to as a model ruler.

00:03:14.939 --> 00:03:15.882
Someone who really takes the

00:03:15.882 --> 00:03:18.910
interest of his people at heart.

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:20.678
So, Cyrus was able to conquer

00:03:20.678 --> 00:03:22.813
a lot of what you see here in green,

00:03:22.813 --> 00:03:23.836
but not all of it.

00:03:23.836 --> 00:03:27.477
And, especially, he was
not able to get to Egypt.

00:03:27.477 --> 00:03:30.793
That would be left to his son, Cambyses.

00:03:30.793 --> 00:03:35.542
So, in 530, Cyrus dies
and Cambyses takes over.

00:03:35.542 --> 00:03:38.737
And, just so you read how
I made this timeline...

00:03:38.737 --> 00:03:39.678
And I made this timeline, really,

00:03:39.678 --> 00:03:42.216
to help myself understand the various

00:03:42.216 --> 00:03:45.291
shahanshahs or king of kings of Iran.

00:03:45.291 --> 00:03:48.323
So, Cyrus the Great was the
shahanshah, king of kings.

00:03:48.323 --> 00:03:50.823
And then, Cambyses II was the next one.

00:03:50.823 --> 00:03:52.215
Is that, this timeline up here,

00:03:52.215 --> 00:03:53.567
this shows who was in charge.

00:03:53.567 --> 00:03:57.873
So, you see from 550/549
all the way up to 530,

00:03:57.873 --> 00:04:00.291
I have it yellow and that's
'cause Cyrus the Great

00:04:00.291 --> 00:04:03.644
was in charge of what is
called the Achaemenid Empire

00:04:03.644 --> 00:04:07.002
or, I guess you could say, this
first great Persian empire.

00:04:07.002 --> 00:04:10.154
What I have down here is the
best information I could find

00:04:10.154 --> 00:04:12.244
on the lifespans of these people.

00:04:12.244 --> 00:04:14.661
And, when I have these dotted
lines at the beginning,

00:04:14.661 --> 00:04:17.527
that's when it's unclear
when these people were born.

00:04:17.527 --> 00:04:18.592
So, there's different accounts that

00:04:18.592 --> 00:04:22.033
Cyrus the Great might
have been born in 575 BCE.

00:04:22.033 --> 00:04:26.002
He might have been born closer to 600 BCE.

00:04:26.002 --> 00:04:27.558
And so, that's why I
have these dotted lines.

00:04:27.558 --> 00:04:30.749
Similarly, we don't know exactly
when Cambyses II was born,

00:04:30.749 --> 00:04:34.516
but we do know that he
took control in 530 BCE.

00:04:34.516 --> 00:04:37.796
And so, that's why you see Cambyses,

00:04:37.796 --> 00:04:40.659
you see this line right
over here turn blue.

00:04:40.659 --> 00:04:44.464
And, actually Cambyses
ends up dying in 522.

00:04:44.464 --> 00:04:47.819
So, actually, this should be like that.

00:04:47.819 --> 00:04:48.652
There you go.

00:04:48.652 --> 00:04:49.743
He ends up dying in 522.

00:04:49.743 --> 00:04:52.162
But, before he dies in 522,

00:04:52.162 --> 00:04:55.412
he is able to conquer Egypt in 525 BCE.

00:04:58.591 --> 00:05:00.676
So, right around there.

00:05:00.676 --> 00:05:04.200
And you can imagine that,
while he's conquering Egypt...

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:06.493
Let me keep drawing this family tree.

00:05:06.493 --> 00:05:08.826
So, now we have Cambyses II.

00:05:13.782 --> 00:05:17.099
He goes off, makes his
real goal to conquer Egypt.

00:05:17.099 --> 00:05:18.040
And that's a big deal.

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:20.539
Remember, this is ending
thousands of years

00:05:20.539 --> 00:05:23.201
of the rule by the native pharaohs.

00:05:23.201 --> 00:05:25.452
These now foreign rulers start

00:05:25.452 --> 00:05:30.211
calling themselves the
pharaohs of Egypt, as well.

00:05:30.211 --> 00:05:31.577
Egypt becomes part of the

00:05:31.577 --> 00:05:34.692
Persian Empire because of Cambyses,

00:05:34.692 --> 00:05:37.269
but you can imagine with the
shahanshah, the king of kings,

00:05:37.269 --> 00:05:39.764
off and doing conquest in Egypt,

00:05:39.764 --> 00:05:41.273
it leaves a little power vacuum

00:05:41.273 --> 00:05:44.058
back in the center of the empire.

00:05:44.058 --> 00:05:46.849
And this is when things
get a little bit sketchy.

00:05:46.849 --> 00:05:50.128
So, Cyrus does have another son.

00:05:50.128 --> 00:05:53.439
Th other son is called Bardiya.

00:05:53.439 --> 00:05:55.239
So, let me write this down.

00:05:55.239 --> 00:05:58.593
So, there's another son called Bardiya.

00:05:58.593 --> 00:06:01.904
And then, there's this other
character known as Darius,

00:06:01.904 --> 00:06:05.346
soon to be known as Darius the Great.

00:06:05.346 --> 00:06:10.096
And Darius is not a direct
descendant of Cyrus the Great,

00:06:10.096 --> 00:06:11.694
but he is part of his family.

00:06:11.694 --> 00:06:13.333
He's a distant relative.

00:06:13.333 --> 00:06:15.668
He is part of the Achaemenid dynasty.

00:06:15.668 --> 00:06:19.226
He claims descendant from Achamenes.

00:06:19.226 --> 00:06:23.072
And he was the lance-bearer
for Cambyses II.

00:06:23.072 --> 00:06:24.219
So, while Cambyses is

00:06:24.219 --> 00:06:27.699
out here in Egypt leaving
that power vacuum,

00:06:27.699 --> 00:06:30.366
someone who claims to be Bardiya

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:35.244
takes control of the empire

00:06:35.244 --> 00:06:38.810
or is trying to take
control of the empire.

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:41.383
Now, some accounts say that
this is really Bardiya.

00:06:41.383 --> 00:06:43.926
This is really the other
son of Cyrus the Great

00:06:43.926 --> 00:06:47.036
and so there would be some
legitimate claim to the throne,

00:06:47.036 --> 00:06:48.672
but there's other claims,
especially the ones

00:06:48.672 --> 00:06:52.440
that Darius was later able to spread,

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:54.362
that, no, this was not the real Bardiya.

00:06:54.362 --> 00:06:55.467
That this was a fake Bardiya.

00:06:55.467 --> 00:06:56.653
That the real Bardiya had actually

00:06:56.653 --> 00:06:59.151
been killed by Cambyses II before

00:06:59.151 --> 00:07:01.199
and that this person
proposing to be Bardiya

00:07:01.199 --> 00:07:03.580
was this fake usurper,

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:07.306
this Zoroastrian priest named Gaumata.

00:07:07.306 --> 00:07:10.133
And, once Cambyses, on his way....

00:07:10.133 --> 00:07:13.407
He's trying to come back in
order to reclaim the throne

00:07:13.407 --> 00:07:16.272
or in order to get rid of this usurper,

00:07:16.272 --> 00:07:17.830
whether it was the real Bardiya or not.

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:18.850
But, on the way, he dies,

00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:20.733
once again, under dubious circumstances.

00:07:20.733 --> 00:07:22.905
Cyrus the Great, how he died, not clear.

00:07:22.905 --> 00:07:26.589
Cambyses II also dies under
dubious circumstances.

00:07:26.589 --> 00:07:28.105
And then this Bardiya actually

00:07:28.105 --> 00:07:29.990
becomes the shahanshah for real.

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:33.307
He obviously has claims to
it while Cambyses is there,

00:07:33.307 --> 00:07:35.722
but, once Cambyses dies,
he is the shaanshah.

00:07:35.722 --> 00:07:37.807
Well, Darius doesn't like this.

00:07:37.807 --> 00:07:40.389
He has his own imperial ambitions.

00:07:40.389 --> 00:07:42.108
He gets some other
nobility together and says,

00:07:42.108 --> 00:07:44.767
"No, no, no, this Bardiya
isn't the real Bardiya.

00:07:44.767 --> 00:07:46.201
He's a usurper.

00:07:46.201 --> 00:07:48.165
Let's go kill that guy."

00:07:48.165 --> 00:07:49.433
And so, they kill him and then...

00:07:49.433 --> 00:07:51.072
It's an interesting story.

00:07:51.072 --> 00:07:52.876
Herodotus has a fairly dubious account

00:07:52.876 --> 00:07:56.025
of how Darius was able to
convince the other noble people

00:07:56.025 --> 00:07:59.424
why he should be the
shahanshah, the emperor.

00:07:59.424 --> 00:08:01.839
But they are able to get rid of Bardiya.

00:08:01.839 --> 00:08:04.133
We still do not know whether
it was the real Bardiya

00:08:04.133 --> 00:08:06.467
or whether it was the fake Bardiya.

00:08:06.467 --> 00:08:09.800
But then, Darius takes power in 522 BCE.

00:08:12.533 --> 00:08:14.417
And he's known as Darius the Great

00:08:14.417 --> 00:08:16.676
because he continues to spread,

00:08:16.676 --> 00:08:21.219
continues to conquer more and
more for the Persian Empire.

00:08:21.219 --> 00:08:22.527
And this map, right over here,

00:08:22.527 --> 00:08:24.122
this is the Persian Empire

00:08:24.122 --> 00:08:26.955
in 500 BCE under Darius the Great.

00:08:27.928 --> 00:08:30.261
It's near its maximum extent.

00:08:30.261 --> 00:08:32.638
And it's a pretty incredible empire.

00:08:32.638 --> 00:08:33.471
It's worth noting....

00:08:33.471 --> 00:08:36.729
And it's big by any
stretch of the imagination.

00:08:36.729 --> 00:08:39.267
But it's at this time the population

00:08:39.267 --> 00:08:42.280
is on the order of 50 million people.

00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:43.884
And, based on the accounts that I've seen,

00:08:43.884 --> 00:08:47.322
that's almost half of the
world population at that time.

00:08:47.322 --> 00:08:49.248
No empire in history,
as far as we can tell,

00:08:49.248 --> 00:08:51.378
has ever had such a large fraction

00:08:51.378 --> 00:08:54.038
of the world's population
under its control.

00:08:54.038 --> 00:08:56.248
And so, that gives you a sense
of, I guess you could say,

00:08:56.248 --> 00:08:59.748
how great or how large an empire this was.

00:09:00.953 --> 00:09:03.448
Now Darius the Great, he is also famous,

00:09:03.448 --> 00:09:05.331
especially from a Greek perspective,

00:09:05.331 --> 00:09:06.927
for going after the Greeks.

00:09:06.927 --> 00:09:10.453
You had these Greek revolts in these towns

00:09:10.453 --> 00:09:13.934
on the west coast of
the Anatolian Peninsula.

00:09:13.934 --> 00:09:16.593
They revolted against
their Persian overlords,

00:09:16.593 --> 00:09:17.426
I guess you could say.

00:09:17.426 --> 00:09:20.198
And they did that with
the help of the Athenians.

00:09:20.198 --> 00:09:22.368
And so, Darius didn't like this.

00:09:22.368 --> 00:09:26.831
In the 490's, he starts
going after the Athenians.

00:09:26.831 --> 00:09:29.941
This is the beginning of
the Greco-Persian Wars.

00:09:29.941 --> 00:09:31.699
He is unsuccessful.

00:09:31.699 --> 00:09:35.175
He dies in the 480's and then his son...

00:09:35.175 --> 00:09:37.386
This is actually a relief of

00:09:37.386 --> 00:09:40.332
Darius the Great right
over here from Persepolis.

00:09:40.332 --> 00:09:43.975
And then, his son continues
to try to take over

00:09:43.975 --> 00:09:46.800
in the Second Greco-Persian Wars.

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:49.255
And he, too, is unsuccessful.

00:09:49.255 --> 00:09:51.303
But, it's worth noting, a lot
of this history that we get,

00:09:51.303 --> 00:09:52.409
especially of Cyrus the Great

00:09:52.409 --> 00:09:55.973
and the early Persian shahanshas,

00:09:55.973 --> 00:09:57.736
the history we get is from the Greeks.

00:09:57.736 --> 00:10:00.112
So, it's worth taking it
with a great grain of salt,

00:10:00.112 --> 00:10:02.486
because, as you can see, they were rivals.

00:10:02.486 --> 00:10:04.658
And to say rivals is a little
bit unfair to the Persians,

00:10:04.658 --> 00:10:05.805
because the Greeks were more of

00:10:05.805 --> 00:10:08.918
a thorn in the side of a large empire.

00:10:08.918 --> 00:10:12.518
The Greeks were this group of city-states.

00:10:12.518 --> 00:10:14.278
They weren't even a unified empire.

00:10:14.278 --> 00:10:15.995
While you had here the Persian Empire

00:10:15.995 --> 00:10:19.110
controls almost half of
the world's population.

00:10:19.110 --> 00:10:21.075
So, the Greeks were more
of a thorn in the side,

00:10:21.075 --> 00:10:23.121
but we get our history from them

00:10:23.121 --> 00:10:24.593
or a lot of our history from them.

00:10:24.593 --> 00:10:27.510
So, we get their account of things.

00:10:28.603 --> 00:10:31.139
Now, once you have Xerxes,

00:10:31.139 --> 00:10:35.231
then, after Xerxes, you have
Artaxerxes, right over here.

00:10:35.231 --> 00:10:36.295
And then, you have a little bit of a

00:10:36.295 --> 00:10:38.790
squabble for the throne
and then Darius II.

00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:39.975
There's one thing that you see

00:10:39.975 --> 00:10:43.085
over 200 years of Achaemenid rule

00:10:43.085 --> 00:10:45.903
is that most people,
after Darius the Great,

00:10:45.903 --> 00:10:50.070
are named either Xerxes,
Artaxerxes, Darius II, III, IV,

00:10:51.527 --> 00:10:54.824
or Darius II or III, at least, not fourth.

00:10:54.824 --> 00:10:57.975
Artaxerxes II, Artaxerxes III.

00:10:57.975 --> 00:10:59.245
So, it can get a little confusing.

00:10:59.245 --> 00:11:01.130
But the reason why I
even did this for myself,

00:11:01.130 --> 00:11:03.832
to see when all these people
lived and when they ruled,

00:11:03.832 --> 00:11:07.516
is to have a good sense
of what was going on

00:11:07.516 --> 00:11:11.523
and how Darius II lived
at a different time

00:11:11.523 --> 00:11:14.551
than, for example, Darius
I, or Darius the Great.

00:11:14.551 --> 00:11:15.942
The other thing worth mentioning,

00:11:15.942 --> 00:11:18.355
'cause you'll hear this
in various history classes

00:11:18.355 --> 00:11:20.769
when you talk about the Persian Empire,

00:11:20.769 --> 00:11:24.288
is the great cities of the Persian Empire.

00:11:24.288 --> 00:11:26.911
Cyrus the Great, he
establishes the capital

00:11:26.911 --> 00:11:29.941
at Pasargadae right over here.

00:11:29.941 --> 00:11:33.667
You have Cambyses establishes
a capital at Susa.

00:11:33.667 --> 00:11:36.247
Susa is one end of the great royal highway

00:11:36.247 --> 00:11:40.414
that goes from Sardis all the
way to Susa right over there.

00:11:41.729 --> 00:11:46.068
You have Darius the Great
establish a capital at Persepolis.

00:11:46.068 --> 00:11:47.543
And that's the Greek name for it,

00:11:47.543 --> 00:11:49.798
literally referring to Persian city.

00:11:49.798 --> 00:11:53.523
And this is a relief from
Persepolis right over here.

00:11:53.523 --> 00:11:56.059
Now, the end of the Achaemenid Dynasty

00:11:56.059 --> 00:11:59.706
comes when that famous
thorn in the side, Greece,

00:11:59.706 --> 00:12:02.776
actually unifies under Philip of Macedon.

00:12:02.776 --> 00:12:05.193
Here, we're talking about the

00:12:07.989 --> 00:12:11.160
early to mid-fourth century BCE.

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:12.633
And his son, Alexander,

00:12:12.633 --> 00:12:15.250
becomes this great conqueror,
Alexander the Great.

00:12:15.250 --> 00:12:18.322
And he's able to conquer
the entire Persian Empire,

00:12:18.322 --> 00:12:20.861
famously taking it away from Darius III.

00:12:20.861 --> 00:12:23.158
We talk about that in another video

00:12:23.158 --> 00:12:25.740
or in several videos in some detail.

00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:28.259
But, Alexander the
Great, he has this vision

00:12:28.259 --> 00:12:30.281
of one nation of these people.

00:12:30.281 --> 00:12:32.493
Their cultures mixing together.

00:12:32.493 --> 00:12:34.213
And there's a significant
amount of cultural mix

00:12:34.213 --> 00:12:36.385
between the Greeks and the Persians.

00:12:36.385 --> 00:12:40.067
But then, Alexander dies
and his empire is split.

00:12:40.067 --> 00:12:42.727
But most of the Persian Empire

00:12:42.727 --> 00:12:45.644
goes under the control of Seleucus,

00:12:47.317 --> 00:12:48.834
who's one of Alexander's generals,

00:12:48.834 --> 00:12:50.145
and then you have the Seleucid Empire,

00:12:50.145 --> 00:12:52.317
which is really foreign rule of Persia.

00:12:52.317 --> 00:12:54.327
And that will continue for a while.

00:12:54.327 --> 00:12:56.334
Until, eventually, the Parthians,

00:12:56.334 --> 00:12:57.973
which is, once again, another

00:12:57.973 --> 00:13:01.291
state or region of the Persian Empire,

00:13:01.291 --> 00:13:03.624
takes control to establish
the Parthian Empire,

00:13:03.624 --> 00:13:06.121
which is one of the rivals to Rome.

00:13:06.121 --> 00:13:07.021
It's worth mentioning,

00:13:07.021 --> 00:13:09.474
and I mention this in the
video on ancient Persia,

00:13:09.474 --> 00:13:10.864
that, under Persian rule, and Cyrus

00:13:10.864 --> 00:13:12.709
and the various shahanshahs

00:13:12.709 --> 00:13:14.919
were famous for delegating
their authority.

00:13:14.919 --> 00:13:16.433
When you have such a large empire,

00:13:16.433 --> 00:13:18.315
you can't control all of it yourself.

00:13:18.315 --> 00:13:20.362
So, each of these regions had their own,

00:13:20.362 --> 00:13:22.162
I guess you could say, governors.

00:13:22.162 --> 00:13:24.129
And those governors were called satraps

00:13:24.129 --> 00:13:26.175
and the regions were called satrapies.

00:13:26.175 --> 00:13:27.484
Anyway, I will leave you there.

00:13:27.484 --> 00:13:28.793
Oh, and the other thing that

00:13:28.793 --> 00:13:30.841
Cyrus the Great is really known for,

00:13:30.841 --> 00:13:33.257
is the spread of the Zoroastrian faith.

00:13:33.257 --> 00:13:36.289
We talk about the Zoroastrian
faith in other videos.

00:13:36.289 --> 00:13:39.645
And Zarathustra, who
is kind of the prophet

00:13:39.645 --> 00:13:41.037
of the Zoroastrian faith,

00:13:41.037 --> 00:13:43.369
he lived someplace between 1500 BCE

00:13:43.369 --> 00:13:46.033
and might have even lived
shortly right before,

00:13:46.033 --> 00:13:47.886
almost near the time of Cyrus the Great.

00:13:47.886 --> 00:13:49.605
But it was really Cyrus
the Great who helps

00:13:49.605 --> 00:13:52.272
spread this great ancient faith.
