00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:02.850
A function, f of x,
is plotted below.

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.720
Highlight an interval where
f of x is less than 0.

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.200
So f of x-- which is
really being plotted

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.920
on the vertical axis
right over here-- x

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:13.900
is the horizontal axis.

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:16.329
f of x being less
than 0 really means

00:00:16.329 --> 00:00:19.130
that the graph is
below the x-axis.

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:23.920
So the function is negative in
this interval right over here

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:25.100
and this interval over here.

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:27.170
So I could put this
anywhere right over here,

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:29.290
or I could stick it
anywhere right over here.

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:30.790
Let me stick it right over here.

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:31.479
There we go.

00:00:31.479 --> 00:00:32.020
Got it right.

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:33.440
Let's do a couple more.

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.380
So the function
is plotted below.

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:38.080
Highlight an interval where
f of x is greater than 0.

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.170
So I could do this
area right over here

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.660
where the function
is above the x-axis,

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.580
or I could do this
area right over here

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:46.930
where the function goes
way above the x-axis.

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:49.080
Well, it even goes off the page.

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:52.030
So let's stick it
right over here.

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:53.930
Let's do one more.

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:57.070
So highlight an interval where
f of x is greater than 0.

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:59.440
Once again, I can do this
region right over here

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.230
where the function
is above the x-axis,

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:05.020
or over here where
it's above the x-axis.

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:07.410
I'll do it here just for fun.

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:09.205
There we go.
