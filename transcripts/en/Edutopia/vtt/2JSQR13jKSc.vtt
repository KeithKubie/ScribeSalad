00:00:09.466 --> 00:00:11.966
&gt;&gt;Narrator: They are where
Maine seventh-graders are,

00:00:12.796 --> 00:00:16.916
in the classroom, at
home and in the field.

00:00:18.856 --> 00:00:24.346
In September of 2002, some 19,000
shiny, new laptops were placed

00:00:24.346 --> 00:00:27.656
in the hands of Maine's
middle-schoolers and their teachers.

00:00:27.656 --> 00:00:30.346
It was the beginning
of a bold experiment

00:00:30.666 --> 00:00:34.586
that may revolutionize public
education, an initiative born

00:00:34.586 --> 00:00:39.026
of a rare budget surplus and the
vision of former Governor Angus King.

00:00:39.636 --> 00:00:41.326
&gt;&gt;Angus: This idea was basically

00:00:41.326 --> 00:00:45.496
to make our people the most
digitally literate society on Earth.

00:00:45.836 --> 00:00:48.336
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Attach that
to me in an e-mail.

00:00:48.676 --> 00:00:53.636
&gt;&gt;Angus: You cannot grasp the power
of this idea until you go into one

00:00:53.636 --> 00:00:57.756
of these seventh-grade classrooms,
where there are 20 kids there all

00:00:57.756 --> 00:01:02.916
with their iBooks open and the
teacher's wandering around up

00:01:02.916 --> 00:01:05.826
and down the aisles and the
kids are all doing this stuff,

00:01:05.866 --> 00:01:07.446
and you can almost hear, "Eureka!"

00:01:07.446 --> 00:01:09.496
&gt;&gt;Teacher: So, what's another
crustacean that you know?

00:01:09.546 --> 00:01:10.076
&gt;&gt;Student: A lobster.

00:01:10.346 --> 00:01:11.866
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Yes, they're related
to lobsters, these are...

00:01:11.866 --> 00:01:14.546
&gt;&gt;Angus: One of the
most powerful parts

00:01:14.546 --> 00:01:17.466
of this idea is that it's everybody.

00:01:19.326 --> 00:01:21.576
Is it an equity tool.

00:01:21.796 --> 00:01:23.696
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Somebody
just take care of that.

00:01:23.886 --> 00:01:26.836
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Using their laptops,
students have decided worlds

00:01:26.836 --> 00:01:28.686
of knowledge beyond the classroom.

00:01:29.056 --> 00:01:31.836
These students from
Nobleboro Central School are

00:01:31.836 --> 00:01:33.856
on a daylong research field trip

00:01:34.196 --> 00:01:37.126
with the Maine Lakes
Conservancy Institute.

00:01:37.126 --> 00:01:39.116
&gt;&gt;Shippen: Today we've been working
with the Nobleboro Central School,

00:01:39.116 --> 00:01:42.186
where we've been out on the lake
on our mobile floating classroom,

00:01:42.186 --> 00:01:44.536
the Melinda Anne, where
the kids have been engaging

00:01:44.536 --> 00:01:48.666
in hands-on experiential lake science
education using different science

00:01:48.666 --> 00:01:51.516
equipment, and they will take
this data back to the classroom,

00:01:51.516 --> 00:01:54.576
where they have put it into their
laptops, and they will load it

00:01:54.576 --> 00:01:57.576
onto the Students Portal
section of the MLCI's Web site,

00:01:57.946 --> 00:02:01.946
where the kids feature their lake,
their community, to show the world.

00:02:02.286 --> 00:02:04.426
&gt;&gt;Student: These are the
old traffic jams, bugs.

00:02:05.336 --> 00:02:08.016
&gt;&gt;Shippen: We start with
developing a sense of wonder,

00:02:08.266 --> 00:02:10.896
and there's two criteria
we have for any piece

00:02:10.896 --> 00:02:11.896
of equipment that comes on the boat.

00:02:12.026 --> 00:02:14.436
One, it has to have a basis
in the science; and, two,

00:02:14.436 --> 00:02:15.966
it's got to have the
"oh, cool" factor.

00:02:16.326 --> 00:02:18.746
If we don't get an "oh, cool" out
of the kids within 30 seconds,

00:02:19.026 --> 00:02:21.336
that equipment's out of there,
because we've only got about an hour

00:02:21.336 --> 00:02:23.316
and a half, 2 hours with
them, and what we want

00:02:23.316 --> 00:02:26.226
to do is really get their
sense of wonder going,

00:02:26.386 --> 00:02:29.656
because that generates the questions,
which leads to new knowledge.

00:02:29.696 --> 00:02:31.766
&gt;&gt;Wow, that is a huge daphnia.

00:02:32.016 --> 00:02:36.096
See if you can zero in on that.

00:02:36.096 --> 00:02:36.316
&gt;&gt;One of the things that
we were looking for was:

00:02:36.316 --> 00:02:39.376
How do we make these laptops more
than just a $2,000.00 pencil?

00:02:39.586 --> 00:02:43.416
What is the transformative
educational value of these laptops,

00:02:43.496 --> 00:02:45.256
and our Students Portal is that.

00:02:45.346 --> 00:02:48.516
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Back in the classroom,
students organize the data

00:02:48.516 --> 00:02:52.316
and photos they gathered in the
field and write descriptions

00:02:52.316 --> 00:02:55.596
of their findings that will be
placed on the conservancy's Web site.

00:02:55.626 --> 00:02:57.306
&gt;&gt;Student: They look
sort of like puffer fish.

00:02:57.526 --> 00:03:00.326
&gt;&gt;Mary Ann: Puffer fish, they do,
that's kind of a good analogy.

00:03:00.326 --> 00:03:04.016
&gt;&gt;I think that hands-on, multisensory
is really what gets them fired up.

00:03:04.076 --> 00:03:04.636
They own it.

00:03:04.636 --> 00:03:05.566
They've experienced it.

00:03:05.566 --> 00:03:08.386
So then to come back to the
classroom and start playing

00:03:08.386 --> 00:03:10.966
with that information and
how to make that enticing

00:03:10.966 --> 00:03:14.356
so other people will want to read
it, I think they get really jazzed

00:03:14.356 --> 00:03:16.466
up about that, because
they're being inventors.

00:03:16.466 --> 00:03:18.566
They're being creators, and
then it's changing the way

00:03:18.566 --> 00:03:19.436
that learning happens.

00:03:19.556 --> 00:03:20.666
&gt;&gt;Student: The first one was better.

00:03:20.936 --> 00:03:23.876
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The laptops are
also changing the way teaching

00:03:23.876 --> 00:03:24.256
happens here.

00:03:24.256 --> 00:03:25.456
&gt;&gt;Teacher: So, listen, here we go.

00:03:25.456 --> 00:03:27.456
Walk me through, because
you guys are the experts.

00:03:27.636 --> 00:03:28.256
&gt;&gt;Student: You edit.

00:03:28.556 --> 00:03:31.136
&gt;&gt;Teacher: We've got to go
down to "Edit Project," right?

00:03:31.896 --> 00:03:35.246
&gt;&gt;Angus: One of the crucial
elements of our project was

00:03:35.246 --> 00:03:38.286
that we took the time and the
money from the outset to work

00:03:38.286 --> 00:03:41.696
with the teachers before dropping
the hardware on the desks,

00:03:42.266 --> 00:03:47.296
because if you just give every kid
a computer, it ain't going to work.

00:03:47.296 --> 00:03:49.806
This is a fundamentally
different way to teach,

00:03:50.706 --> 00:03:53.476
to get at information,
to present information.

00:03:53.806 --> 00:03:55.876
The integration of the Internet

00:03:55.956 --> 00:04:01.236
into the daily curriculum is the
next big educational challenge.

00:04:01.626 --> 00:04:04.116
&gt;&gt;Ken: Microscopic blue-green algae.

00:04:04.616 --> 00:04:07.506
&gt;&gt;Narrator: For science teacher
Ken Williams, using the laptops

00:04:07.506 --> 00:04:11.636
to exploit Internet resources
has been a liberating experience.

00:04:11.866 --> 00:04:14.056
&gt;&gt;Ken: Say, "Here's the loon
assignment from my dad."

00:04:14.786 --> 00:04:15.016
Go.

00:04:15.496 --> 00:04:17.576
&gt;&gt;Student: Here's the loon
assignment from my dad.

00:04:18.626 --> 00:04:20.556
&gt;&gt;Ken: Good, beautiful,
now let me go see...

00:04:20.556 --> 00:04:23.926
&gt;&gt;I actually have worked less this
year and kids have worked more,

00:04:24.456 --> 00:04:27.866
because I've done less talking
and they've done more finding,

00:04:28.426 --> 00:04:30.306
and it's absolutely
happened that way.

00:04:30.366 --> 00:04:32.306
&gt;&gt;Student: We can find
things out for ourselves.

00:04:32.426 --> 00:04:34.556
You can just say, "All
right, everybody.

00:04:34.556 --> 00:04:37.876
Search Google and try and find
some information about this," or,

00:04:38.136 --> 00:04:41.026
"Let's go out on the boat and find
these little bugs and take pictures

00:04:41.026 --> 00:04:43.116
of them to display on the
Internet," or something like that.

00:04:43.176 --> 00:04:46.716
It's just more interesting that we
can find things out for ourselves.

00:04:47.106 --> 00:04:51.366
I think you're learning more that
way than reading about it in a book.

00:04:51.406 --> 00:04:53.296
&gt;&gt;Ken: They're seeing
the whole picture.

00:04:53.816 --> 00:04:57.426
They're seeing how a little worm
can get plopped on the Internet

00:04:57.716 --> 00:05:00.136
for somebody else to see that,
and I think there's going

00:05:00.136 --> 00:05:04.716
to be this great rippling effect
of information and stewardship.

00:05:04.716 --> 00:05:06.236
I think that's the goal.

00:05:07.586 --> 00:05:09.576
&gt;&gt;Narrator: At King
Middle School in Portland,

00:05:09.576 --> 00:05:11.976
students create digital products

00:05:11.976 --> 00:05:13.946
that demonstrate the
depth of their learning.

00:05:14.596 --> 00:05:18.666
One class recently worked with the
local Audubon Society to produce

00:05:18.806 --> 00:05:22.736
"Fading Footprints," a CD-ROM
that catalogues several

00:05:22.736 --> 00:05:24.576
of Maine's endangered species.

00:05:24.706 --> 00:05:29.366
Each student picked an animal
and created original artwork

00:05:29.366 --> 00:05:32.716
and written descriptions that
required extensive research.

00:05:32.716 --> 00:05:35.656
&gt;&gt;Student: We were also using our
library and many books that tried

00:05:35.876 --> 00:05:37.596
to find some information on Internet.

00:05:37.706 --> 00:05:42.286
We use our laptops a lot,
that was the big help.

00:05:42.286 --> 00:05:44.376
&gt;&gt;David: What used to happen is
you'd have to go down to the library

00:05:44.376 --> 00:05:46.756
and you'd read and you'd take your
notes on a separate piece of paper

00:05:46.756 --> 00:05:48.696
and then you'd take all your
notes and put them on cards

00:05:48.696 --> 00:05:50.916
and then you'd go and you'd
build something from them

00:05:50.916 --> 00:05:53.976
in your English class, and now
you're doing this whole gathering

00:05:53.976 --> 00:05:57.486
of information and expressing it and
representing it at the same time.

00:05:57.916 --> 00:06:01.216
And so what happens is kids
are working with information,

00:06:01.466 --> 00:06:03.416
more information they've
ever seen before

00:06:03.616 --> 00:06:05.576
in a much more immediate
and gratifying way.

00:06:06.226 --> 00:06:07.936
&gt;&gt;Student: Land, that's
like geography.

00:06:07.936 --> 00:06:09.506
&gt;&gt;Student: That's geography.

00:06:09.506 --> 00:06:13.866
&gt;&gt;David: The laptops come with
an amazing set of applications

00:06:13.866 --> 00:06:17.456
that allow kids to work with so many
different kinds of ways of thinking.

00:06:17.676 --> 00:06:20.266
&gt;&gt;Student: We're linking to sort
of make sure that each page goes

00:06:20.266 --> 00:06:24.016
to the correct other
page, like if you clicked

00:06:24.016 --> 00:06:26.806
on "documentary video" it would
really go to the documentary video.

00:06:26.806 --> 00:06:29.326
And then everyone's
pages had to be linked.

00:06:29.326 --> 00:06:31.316
&gt;&gt;Student: It took a long time.

00:06:31.316 --> 00:06:32.506
&gt;&gt;Student: But once
you got the hang of it,

00:06:32.506 --> 00:06:35.356
it sort of all connects all together.

00:06:35.356 --> 00:06:37.016
&gt;&gt;Seymour: These kids
are more engaged.

00:06:37.016 --> 00:06:41.416
These kids are coming to school
more promptly, they are talking

00:06:41.416 --> 00:06:43.836
at home more about what
they did at school.

00:06:44.406 --> 00:06:47.196
&gt;&gt;Narrator: As a prime mover
of the laptop initiative,

00:06:47.196 --> 00:06:50.086
Seymour Papert is encouraged
by what he has seen

00:06:50.086 --> 00:06:51.886
in the first year of the program.

00:06:52.226 --> 00:06:53.936
&gt;&gt;Student: This year my
grades were a lot better.

00:06:53.936 --> 00:06:55.676
I think it was because of laptops,

00:06:55.676 --> 00:06:58.066
because I was doing better
work and was more interested.

00:06:58.756 --> 00:07:00.806
&gt;&gt;Seymour: Does it make
it harder or easier?

00:07:00.846 --> 00:07:03.176
&gt;&gt;Student: Sometimes it's easier
and sometimes it's harder.

00:07:03.266 --> 00:07:05.006
&gt;&gt;Seymour: Which do you prefer?

00:07:05.006 --> 00:07:07.736
&gt;&gt;Student: Well, I like it harder,
because then I'm learning more.

00:07:07.896 --> 00:07:10.436
&gt;&gt;Student: Sometimes our teachers
make our projects harder and things,

00:07:10.496 --> 00:07:15.156
because we have our laptops to
access information and stuff.

00:07:15.616 --> 00:07:18.576
&gt;&gt;Seymour: It's lovely seeing that
it's taking on this excitement,

00:07:18.576 --> 00:07:21.766
but I keep on insisting
it is just a first step.

00:07:21.956 --> 00:07:24.026
In the course of time,
people will see

00:07:24.026 --> 00:07:27.396
that they can do very different
stuff in school, and what's great

00:07:27.396 --> 00:07:29.346
about the situation here
is what it could grow

00:07:29.346 --> 00:07:33.576
into that goes beyond what is
happening in many other places

00:07:33.576 --> 00:07:34.556
where there are computers.

00:07:34.766 --> 00:07:37.766
&gt;&gt;David: The title for
the laptop initiative,

00:07:37.856 --> 00:07:40.276
as far as I like to remember,
is called "Maine Learns,"

00:07:40.716 --> 00:07:43.256
and the learning is about how
to work with other people.

00:07:43.716 --> 00:07:46.806
It's about how to get
teachers and kids

00:07:46.806 --> 00:07:50.546
to re-imagine what the classroom
is and to apply that knowledge

00:07:50.816 --> 00:07:54.406
and to take it to someplace new,
but the main thing is the seed

00:07:54.406 --> 00:07:56.536
of change is the computer,
and it's right there.

00:07:56.536 --> 00:07:57.716
Everybody's got it.

00:07:57.876 --> 00:08:00.126
They know they've got to use
it, and, boy, is it happening.

00:08:00.846 --> 00:08:02.746
&gt;&gt;Teacher: You guys
are right on the money.

00:08:04.196 --> 00:08:06.136
