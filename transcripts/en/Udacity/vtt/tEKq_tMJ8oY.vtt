[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:00:05.133 --> 00:00:07.287
So, we know everything's going to be on the page

00:00:07.287 --> 00:00:09.520
now. We just need to paint the pixels, right?

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:14.060
&gt;&gt; Yeah, except just paint the pixels is not as simple or as easy as it sounds.

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:15.940
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I had a feeling you'd say that.

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:19.020
&gt;&gt; Let's do a quick quiz to test your intuition. Imagine

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.880
we give the browser these two nodes from the render tree.

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.630
Do you think there's any difference in how quickly we can

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.320
paint their content? Write a sentence or two to explain your answer.
