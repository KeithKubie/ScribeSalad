00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:12.620
SPEAKER: We're thrilled,
both as a company,

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:14.411
here at Google Ann
Arbor, and me personally

00:00:14.411 --> 00:00:19.430
to welcome one of Detroit's
most high-profile and impactful

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:22.970
native sons, Jalen Rose, here
to Google, Ann Arbor today.

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:25.980
Jalen is known by, I
would assume, pretty much

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.600
all of you-- but Detroit
native, high school

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:33.710
at Detroit southwestern,
a school boy basketball

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:36.860
player who then came to
the University of Michigan.

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.290
Many of you know
the Fab Five, where

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:45.030
Jalen played with his buddies
here in the early '90s.

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.330
Jalen was then selected
in the 1994 NBA draft

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:52.980
and had a 13-year
career in the NBA.

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.340
I think one of the topics we'll
get into today, in some detail,

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.460
is what Jalen has done
after his life in the NBA--

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.550
both the impact and time
he spent in Detroit as well

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:09.400
as some of his thoughts
on-- [AUDIO OUT] --game

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.510
plan here is I'll ask him
questions for the first 30

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.794
minutes or so,
get Jalen to share

00:01:14.794 --> 00:01:16.210
a little bit about
his perspective

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:18.017
as a Detroiter who's
gone on to stardom,

00:01:18.017 --> 00:01:19.600
and then we'll make
sure to open it up

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.610
to questions in the second half
and take live questions here.

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:24.340
We'll have a mic that
we'll pass around.

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.800
Prior to start, give people
a little context for you.

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:31.150
Many of them know you from
your public profile today.

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:33.470
But a native Detroiter,
you were here

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:35.470
at the University of
Michigan in the early '90s,

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:37.810
which meant you were growing
up in Detroit in the '70s

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:38.440
and '80s.

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.350
Maybe you could just
give us a little context

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.820
for your experience
growing up and we'll

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.550
build towards your observations
of how Detroit has changed.

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:47.966
JALEN ROSE: So when you talk
about how things have changed

00:01:47.966 --> 00:01:50.560
from like the '70s
and '80s until now,

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.940
the dynamic plays no further
than through education.

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:56.030
Because [INAUDIBLE]
describe, you

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.490
can actually have a
high school diploma

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.490
and get a really good job and
possibly make six figures.

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:04.630
Now, you have to have
a college degree.

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:06.800
That's basic.

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:10.470
And so in starting the Jalen
Rose Leadership Academy,

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.510
we're a tuition-free
public charter high school.

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.430
We're open enrollment.

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.850
We have 400 students
in the building.

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:19.880
We also graduated,
the last two years,

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.020
approximately 170 students.

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:25.140
And 100% of those
students went on

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.960
to a post-secondary education,
whether it's a university,

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:29.920
trade, or military.

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.590
And being a 9-16
model is not just

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.950
about getting these
kids at ninth grade

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.740
and graduating them
from high school.

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:38.830
It's actually staying with
them and nurturing them

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:40.060
through college.

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.810
Because that eight years,
to me, is the most important

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.700
eight years of your life.

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.480
It's the years where you
start to make decisions

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.110
that can impact your future.

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:50.670
But you're so very young.

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.970
And a lot of times,
you're making decisions--

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:55.680
making decisions at
17 or 18 that could

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.600
affect your long term future.

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.560
So we're really excited about
the progress of the school.

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.297
And we're committed
to try to do what

00:03:03.297 --> 00:03:05.380
we can to educate as many
young people as possible

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:07.921
and put them in position to take
care of themselves and those

00:03:07.921 --> 00:03:09.005
that they love.

00:03:09.005 --> 00:03:09.880
SPEAKER: Great stuff.

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.352
On behalf of those of
us who are educated here

00:03:12.352 --> 00:03:13.810
in the state of
Michigan, thank you

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:15.920
for your commitment to
education in the state.

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.878
JALEN ROSE: Well thing
that stinks actually-- I

00:03:17.878 --> 00:03:21.870
saw a statistic that
approximately 12%

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:25.910
of Detroit area
adults have graduated

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:29.240
from college-- only 12%.

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:31.809
So when we get a lot
of our students--

00:03:31.809 --> 00:03:34.100
and again I mentioned, we
are open enrollment, tuition,

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:35.780
free public charter--
all you have to do

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:37.240
is fill out the form.

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:40.860
What I'm trying to do is create
a private school environment

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:43.405
for public school kids
where they can all

00:03:43.405 --> 00:03:46.010
compete in the same
collegiate classroom.

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:48.900
So unfortunately in
our country, education

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:52.110
has now been defined
by your zip code.

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:55.190
And we can mask and
act like it's not

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:58.550
happening the way it is or what
type of overtone or undertone

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:59.050
that it is.

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:00.610
But it does exist.

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:03.500
So for those parents like myself
that are really fortunate that

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:05.620
can put their kids
through private school,

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.050
that investment starts
at kindergarten.

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:11.970
So basically, K through 12, if
you're paying $30,000 a year,

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:13.842
that becomes an investment.

00:04:13.842 --> 00:04:15.800
For those that are
fortunate enough to the move

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:19.820
to the suburbs, our country
dictates you pay more in taxes,

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:21.690
so your school
should be better even

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:23.300
though they're public schools.

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:26.260
So now if you look at
like West Bloomfield,

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:29.590
students get
$13,500 per student.

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:34.710
Plus for public school, they
also get gifted a building

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:36.320
for the students.

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:39.280
So in Detroit on
the Northwest side,

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:42.880
our students get
$7,100 per student.

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:45.560
So what I'm trying to do
is bridge the education gap

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:49.110
so that a kid, in theory,
that's getting $7,000 every year

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:52.290
invested in their education
can compete in the same college

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:55.740
classroom as the other two
scenarios I just described.

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:58.020
And that's the hard
work we do every day.

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:59.400
SPEAKER: I think
our friend Jalen

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:03.110
knows his educational
policy, huh guys?

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:05.380
JALEN ROSE: I'm the
founder of a school.

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:07.380
I only do a couple of things.

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:09.510
But only do things that I
think I'm pretty good at.

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:11.593
Like I don't play golf
because I'm not good at it.

00:05:11.593 --> 00:05:12.750
I don't care about it.

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:14.060
I don't eat sushi.

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:14.790
I don't know why.

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:15.560
I just don't.

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:17.280
I mean, I don't use emojis.

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:18.459
I don't know why I don't.

00:05:18.459 --> 00:05:19.750
I'm weird about certain things.

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:21.604
SPEAKER: Figure out what
you're good at and go deep.

00:05:21.604 --> 00:05:22.538
JALEN ROSE: Yeah.

00:05:22.538 --> 00:05:23.472
SPEAKER: That's a
good life philosophy.

00:05:23.472 --> 00:05:24.638
JALEN ROSE: Don't get fired.

00:05:24.638 --> 00:05:26.350
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:27.540
SPEAKER: There you go.

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:29.610
So it strikes me that
a lot about this school

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:32.380
is about setting up those
students for a lifetime

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:34.060
of achievement and success.

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:36.930
And part of that, the
leadership focus-- helping

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:38.790
prepare them for transitions.

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:42.090
We were talking a little bit
earlier-- a lot of our audience

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:44.740
is early career folk, some
of them in the first job.

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:48.330
You've been through transitions
in a really high profile way,

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:50.760
obviously going from
high school to college

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:54.350
and being on the basketball
court, and into the pros.

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:57.660
You've had situations where
you've had a coaching change

00:05:57.660 --> 00:05:59.160
or something has
happened and you've

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:01.590
been thrown into a transition,
maybe not of your own making.

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:03.500
And maybe that's a little
bit like those of us here

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:06.210
who have a manager change where
it just sort of happens to us.

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:08.190
Maybe it wasn't our choice.

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:10.950
So as you think about
your path and your success

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:14.550
and how you tried to instill
in those Academy students--

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:16.410
Leadership Academy
students, the skills

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:18.240
to prepare for
transition, reflect

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:20.030
on transitions in your life.

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:24.260
Any thoughts on career and
transitions for this audience?

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:27.440
I love that pick a couple things
and do them really well piece.

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:28.520
JALEN ROSE: Absolutely.

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:30.920
Life skills are just as
important as being educated

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:33.346
and how you are able
to articulate yourself.

00:06:33.346 --> 00:06:34.720
And if you think
you're not being

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:37.190
judged by of those things
and your appearance,

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:38.480
you need to wake up.

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:41.590
Because what you post on
social media, the people

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:44.140
that you surround yourself
with, when people bring you

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:47.600
in for an, interview they
already know this about you.

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:49.434
It's almost like
being a recruit.

00:06:49.434 --> 00:06:51.100
When somebody comes
into my living room,

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:52.350
they know everything about me.

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:54.270
They know if we live
in a cul-de-sac,

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:56.070
they know if we have
a mailbox or not.

00:06:56.070 --> 00:07:01.160
They know everything about
you before they allow you in.

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:04.860
The dynamic that I
learned [INAUDIBLE]

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:07.016
is, I've actually
had a lot of jobs.

00:07:07.016 --> 00:07:10.730
I was one of the kids
that, when I was young--

00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:13.480
and I know times are
a lot different now--

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:16.860
but I was somebody that,
when winter time came,

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:19.480
I would shovel the snow
in the front yard for $5,

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:23.050
front and back for $12, pick
an odd number so I can get 15

00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:23.635
and keep $3--

00:07:23.635 --> 00:07:26.110
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:29.920
Or pumping gas at
the gas station,

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:31.415
carrying bags at
the supermarket.

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:35.700
What other jobs did I have?

00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:38.930
I've been a paper boy.

00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:39.610
I was good too.

00:07:39.610 --> 00:07:41.940
I would always put the paper
in the door, every time.

00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:44.020
Even if it was cold outside.

00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:45.680
SPEAKER: How early
were you doing that?

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:48.470
JALEN ROSE: Um-- 5:00,
6:00 in the morning.

00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:49.500
SPEAKER: That's early.

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:51.449
JALEN ROSE: Yes indeed.

00:07:51.449 --> 00:07:52.990
What are some of
the other job that I

00:07:52.990 --> 00:07:57.180
want to share with you that-- I
was a police cadet one summer.

00:07:57.180 --> 00:07:59.522
I worked at an envelope company.

00:07:59.522 --> 00:08:01.270
I learned how to drive a hi-lo.

00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:03.910
I actually have my hi-lo
license, true story.

00:08:03.910 --> 00:08:04.806
SPEAKER: Right on.

00:08:04.806 --> 00:08:06.180
JALEN ROSE: I
worked at Dave Bing

00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:08.130
Steel for a couple of Summers.

00:08:08.130 --> 00:08:11.550
And this was when I was in
high school, so it wasn't like,

00:08:11.550 --> 00:08:14.540
oh Dave Bing played with my
dad and he's my godfather,

00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:16.520
so he's looking out for me.

00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:20.930
It was like, I'm on the press
and on the line with adults.

00:08:20.930 --> 00:08:25.210
It's 5,000 pieces
of steel coming down

00:08:25.210 --> 00:08:27.620
and you gotta be
meticulous with each one.

00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:30.270
They don't care anything
about your mistakes.

00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:33.945
Or if you hesitate a little
bit or you have to sneeze

00:08:33.945 --> 00:08:36.320
or scratch your nose-- like
little things like that could

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:38.840
throw off an entire assembly.

00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:42.505
And so I learned how to be
more detail oriented with that.

00:08:42.505 --> 00:08:44.380
But the one thing you
have to learn how to do

00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:47.200
is just manage relationships,
respect others,

00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:49.190
and just be good at your job.

00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:52.080
A lot of times in corporate
environments, people

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:54.480
get more caught up in
gossiping and worrying

00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:58.510
about the opportunities
that other people get.

00:08:58.510 --> 00:09:00.630
Just continue to nurture
the relationships.

00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:03.570
And in sports, it's a little
different because normally

00:09:03.570 --> 00:09:07.440
the person that drafted you or
the person that traded for you,

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:10.070
well they are going
to probably give you

00:09:10.070 --> 00:09:16.290
more leeway to succeed
because we all have bad days.

00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:19.300
When the opposite happens--
when you're in a position

00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:21.020
and then there's a
management change,

00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:22.644
you might want to
dust off your resume.

00:09:22.644 --> 00:09:23.580
SPEAKER: [LAUGHS]

00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:25.810
JALEN ROSE: No, I'm for real.

00:09:25.810 --> 00:09:28.450
Like, you have to press Reset.

00:09:28.450 --> 00:09:30.030
When the people
above you change,

00:09:30.030 --> 00:09:31.640
you really have to press Reset.

00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:33.109
Because they didn't hire you.

00:09:33.109 --> 00:09:34.150
They didn't bring you in.

00:09:34.150 --> 00:09:37.410
So they're not invested
in what you're going

00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:38.820
to be able to do going forward.

00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:42.470
So they may not have the type
of leash than the person who

00:09:42.470 --> 00:09:44.410
initially brought you in.

00:09:44.410 --> 00:09:49.230
So at JRLA, one of the things
we talk to young people about

00:09:49.230 --> 00:09:51.770
is having life
skills, social skills,

00:09:51.770 --> 00:09:55.270
we try to educate them
about etiquette and problem

00:09:55.270 --> 00:09:59.210
solving, decision making,
sex, drugs, violence,

00:09:59.210 --> 00:10:00.281
gang prevention.

00:10:00.281 --> 00:10:02.030
When you're dealing
with high school kids,

00:10:02.030 --> 00:10:05.590
they have the type
of issues that we

00:10:05.590 --> 00:10:07.915
know exist on a daily
basis, good, bad, and ugly.

00:10:07.915 --> 00:10:08.790
SPEAKER: Good advice.

00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:10.780
Thank you for that perspective.

00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:13.910
Some experience from transitions
and as a professional athlete.

00:10:13.910 --> 00:10:16.190
That's good feedback for us.

00:10:16.190 --> 00:10:17.650
So we have your book here.

00:10:17.650 --> 00:10:21.180
We know you're an author
of a book recently.

00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:23.626
And for those of us who
live in a digital world--

00:10:23.626 --> 00:10:25.250
we'll come to some
questions about what

00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:28.280
it's like to have a digital
presence today in a moment.

00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:31.520
JALEN ROSE: This is
actually my second book.

00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:34.160
It's just I don't get paid
anything for the first one.

00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:35.840
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:37.850
You guys saw another
book that Mitch Albom

00:10:37.850 --> 00:10:39.410
did on the Fab Five, right?

00:10:39.410 --> 00:10:40.867
That became a best selling book.

00:10:40.867 --> 00:10:41.700
SPEAKER: Yes it did.

00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:43.160
JALEN ROSE: Well I love
Mitch, but I'm still

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:45.460
trying to get him to come
to one of our golf outings.

00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:48.180
Still trying to get him
to sponsor a student.

00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:48.790
OK?

00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:51.950
I've done multiple
interviews on his platform.

00:10:51.950 --> 00:10:54.380
And that book was
really successful.

00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:57.500
And I'm happy that it was
written and the story got told.

00:10:57.500 --> 00:11:00.480
I actually was so
upset that it happened,

00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:04.390
I didn't read that book
until two years ago.

00:11:04.390 --> 00:11:07.489
I wrote that book
before I wrote this one.

00:11:07.489 --> 00:11:09.530
SPEAKER: Did that motivate
you to write this one?

00:11:09.530 --> 00:11:12.370
JALEN ROSE: No.

00:11:12.370 --> 00:11:14.440
I wanted to get
the clarity of what

00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:16.935
he felt about what he was
seeing through his eyes,

00:11:16.935 --> 00:11:20.530
as somebody that wasn't
necessarily in the foxhole,

00:11:20.530 --> 00:11:24.464
versus my story where I know
all of the moving parts.

00:11:24.464 --> 00:11:25.880
SPEAKER: So that's
a 15 or 20 year

00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:27.860
lag between when that came
out and when you read it.

00:11:27.860 --> 00:11:28.693
JALEN ROSE: Correct.

00:11:28.693 --> 00:11:31.610
It was a couple of things.

00:11:31.610 --> 00:11:33.890
The first thing was the
Fab Five documentary.

00:11:33.890 --> 00:11:38.110
And so that came out in
2011-- March of 2011.

00:11:38.110 --> 00:11:41.670
And I felt, as the executive
producer of the doc,

00:11:41.670 --> 00:11:46.500
that it was time for us to
just unleash everything we

00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:48.230
[INAUDIBLE] of the scenario.

00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:51.860
And the next day, just
wake up and it's over.

00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:54.420
And so that was the
thinking behind it.

00:11:54.420 --> 00:11:57.100
I remember reaching out
to all of the fellas

00:11:57.100 --> 00:11:58.924
to be a part of it,
and all of the coaches,

00:11:58.924 --> 00:12:00.840
and all of the media
members that, any of you,

00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:05.520
if you ever saw the documentary,
participated-- including Chris.

00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:09.610
And so we tried to track him
down to get his interview.

00:12:09.610 --> 00:12:11.360
He got kind of elusive,
then he decided

00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:13.120
he didn't want to do it.

00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:15.140
But like I told him,
whatever you still

00:12:15.140 --> 00:12:18.990
harboring about that
situation, you gotta let it go.

00:12:18.990 --> 00:12:20.150
You winnin' right now.

00:12:20.150 --> 00:12:22.610
Like-- you got a good gig.

00:12:22.610 --> 00:12:27.500
You know-- you have expanded
beyond that scenario, I think.

00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:30.020
When you continue to
carry that burden,

00:12:30.020 --> 00:12:32.350
it just kind of
becomes something

00:12:32.350 --> 00:12:36.820
that you can't really escape.

00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:38.320
And you need to just exhale.

00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:41.820
But for whatever reason, he
chose not to participate.

00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:43.940
That was a big time mistake.

00:12:43.940 --> 00:12:46.360
And we continued
to go on and do it.

00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:49.680
It was a successful documentary
It made a couple of people

00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:50.801
upset.

00:12:50.801 --> 00:12:52.800
But that's what happens
when you tell the truth.

00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:56.350
But I was excited
about the project.

00:12:56.350 --> 00:12:59.460
And so this really,
for me personally, it

00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:02.540
was like the documentary,
read the Fab Five book

00:13:02.540 --> 00:13:05.410
by Mitch Albom, and
then write my own book.

00:13:05.410 --> 00:13:07.902
So I was doing a lot
of reading and writing.

00:13:07.902 --> 00:13:08.860
I can actually do that.

00:13:11.620 --> 00:13:14.960
SPEAKER: In our world here, we
might think somebody like you

00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:19.740
from a 21st century, digital
profiles as a content creator.

00:13:19.740 --> 00:13:22.440
You've created a documentary,
you've written a book,

00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:24.070
obviously you spend
your profession

00:13:24.070 --> 00:13:27.690
now with a lapel mic on you.

00:13:27.690 --> 00:13:31.940
As somebody who's done those
sorts of things, what's

00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:34.100
the biggest surprise for
you about writing a book

00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:36.020
or reflecting on
the documentary?

00:13:36.020 --> 00:13:37.800
When you're in your
voice out there

00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:41.220
and you have full control, I
still imagine a couple bumps

00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:42.520
along the way and surprises.

00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:44.103
What surprised you
in these processes?

00:13:44.103 --> 00:13:49.540
JALEN ROSE: Well, content that
you want people to accept,

00:13:49.540 --> 00:13:51.290
it has to be genuine.

00:13:51.290 --> 00:13:55.320
Like people see straight through
phony-- straight through it.

00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:57.240
And so whether
it's a documentary,

00:13:57.240 --> 00:14:01.120
whether it's a book, you
want to be authentic.

00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:05.620
But one thing I actually do that
I always pretend I don't do,

00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:07.066
I actually work hard.

00:14:07.066 --> 00:14:08.000
SPEAKER: [CHUCKLES]

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:08.660
JALEN ROSE: No I'm serious.

00:14:08.660 --> 00:14:09.400
I actually--

00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:11.608
SPEAKER: I'm glad you pretend
that you don't do that.

00:14:11.608 --> 00:14:13.760
JALEN ROSE: Well
because it's more fun.

00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:16.727
And seriously, as a
former basketball player,

00:14:16.727 --> 00:14:18.560
sometimes it's just
easier to play the heal.

00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:19.589
It's just easier.

00:14:19.589 --> 00:14:20.380
Hey, how you doing?

00:14:20.380 --> 00:14:21.069
Nothing.

00:14:21.069 --> 00:14:22.360
Oh whatever, ain't no big deal.

00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:25.010
And show up and know
more than everybody.

00:14:25.010 --> 00:14:27.890
Because I've been
doing it all morning.

00:14:27.890 --> 00:14:32.970
So it's something
that people don't

00:14:32.970 --> 00:14:35.620
realize that, at
Michigan, my major was

00:14:35.620 --> 00:14:39.770
radio, TV, film-- communications
was actually my major.

00:14:39.770 --> 00:14:43.720
So I'm probably the only person
in here working in their major?

00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:44.220
Right?

00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:44.730
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:44.730 --> 00:14:47.146
SPEAKER: Certainly the only
one up here that can say that.

00:14:47.146 --> 00:14:47.930
I can assure you.

00:14:47.930 --> 00:14:49.230
JALEN ROSE: Ain't that
something how this works?

00:14:49.230 --> 00:14:51.229
We go to school all of
those years, get a major,

00:14:51.229 --> 00:14:53.360
and get a job doing
something else.

00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:55.870
But I'm fortunate enough that
I actually work in my major.

00:14:55.870 --> 00:14:58.120
So I also think that
gives me an advantage.

00:14:58.120 --> 00:15:01.400
So while I was
playing ball, it was

00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:04.640
2000 I was playing
in the NBA finals.

00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:06.900
I get traded to
the Bulls in 2002.

00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:09.780
I'm like, we ain't
going to the finals.

00:15:09.780 --> 00:15:13.800
We only have nine wins
and it's February.

00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:16.937
SPEAKER: As described in
the introduction book,

00:15:16.937 --> 00:15:18.270
Jalen's thoughts on that matter.

00:15:18.270 --> 00:15:20.327
JALEN ROSE: So I actually
did an interview--

00:15:20.327 --> 00:15:21.910
I know I'm showing
my age here-- there

00:15:21.910 --> 00:15:24.730
was BET Mad Sports at the time.

00:15:24.730 --> 00:15:27.010
And so I did an
interview with them.

00:15:27.010 --> 00:15:29.850
Somebody gave me a card--
I kept a business car.

00:15:29.850 --> 00:15:31.720
I reached out to them.

00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:35.400
And it was the Lakers and the
New Jersey Nets in the finals.

00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:37.340
And I was like, I
got a spot in LA.

00:15:37.340 --> 00:15:40.050
All you guys have to
do is send the camera.

00:15:40.050 --> 00:15:40.860
I'll edit it.

00:15:40.860 --> 00:15:42.100
I'll get us the access.

00:15:42.100 --> 00:15:43.360
I'll do everything.

00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:45.660
And then if you don't
like it, I'll just eat it.

00:15:45.660 --> 00:15:48.780
If you like it, you play it.

00:15:48.780 --> 00:15:49.914
And so I did it.

00:15:49.914 --> 00:15:51.080
I did all of the interviews.

00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:53.610
I got Shaq, I got Kobe, I got
Byron Scott, I got Jason Kidd,

00:15:53.610 --> 00:15:55.010
I got everybody.

00:15:55.010 --> 00:15:58.610
And so then they liked
it, used them to edit it,

00:15:58.610 --> 00:16:01.240
because they got the budget,
they got the editing room.

00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:02.170
OK?

00:16:02.170 --> 00:16:05.150
So then once they did that, I
turned around and pitched that

00:16:05.150 --> 00:16:07.700
to Fox and the Best
Damn Sports Show.

00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:12.310
So from 2003 to 2007, I
was playing in the league,

00:16:12.310 --> 00:16:16.320
but I was also working
for Best Damn Sports Show,

00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:17.170
simultaneously.

00:16:17.170 --> 00:16:19.746
So I was doing other
media gigs along the way.

00:16:19.746 --> 00:16:21.120
SPEAKER: Seeing
both sides of it.

00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:22.078
JALEN ROSE: Absolutely.

00:16:22.078 --> 00:16:23.610
I worked sideline for TNT.

00:16:23.610 --> 00:16:27.100
I worked with Shaq-- I mean,
I'm sorry, Shaq wasn't there--

00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:29.990
but I worked with
Kenny and Charles, ABC

00:16:29.990 --> 00:16:32.790
when they were doing their
halftime with Bill Walton,

00:16:32.790 --> 00:16:35.780
a lot of ESPN appearances.

00:16:35.780 --> 00:16:37.740
And so that gave
me the experience.

00:16:37.740 --> 00:16:41.750
So in 2007, when I decided
to go full time in the media,

00:16:41.750 --> 00:16:45.280
though I was a first-year
player removed from the league,

00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:49.881
I was by far a rookie
in doing media stuff.

00:16:49.881 --> 00:16:51.380
SPEAKER: You got
your apprenticeship

00:16:51.380 --> 00:16:52.880
while you were still
doing the main gig.

00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:54.500
JALEN ROSE: Yeah
this was my-- so that

00:16:54.500 --> 00:16:57.660
was-- this was what, my 14th,
15th straight year covering

00:16:57.660 --> 00:16:59.510
the finals for TV.

00:16:59.510 --> 00:17:02.230
And there weren't
as many outlets

00:17:02.230 --> 00:17:04.609
obviously then as it was now.

00:17:04.609 --> 00:17:07.430
So there wasn't any NBA TV.

00:17:07.430 --> 00:17:09.200
Sometimes the games were on NBC.

00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:11.940
Sometimes the games were on ABC.

00:17:11.940 --> 00:17:13.109
And that was it.

00:17:13.109 --> 00:17:15.119
So it was really-- and ESPN.

00:17:15.119 --> 00:17:19.230
So it probably was only
like 10 to 15 total jobs.

00:17:19.230 --> 00:17:20.304
It wasn't a lot of jobs.

00:17:20.304 --> 00:17:22.890
SPEAKER: I love that description
of just, send me the camera,

00:17:22.890 --> 00:17:23.510
I can do it.

00:17:23.510 --> 00:17:25.640
I mean if that doesn't
sound like a viral YouTube

00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:29.650
video and the way some of our
YouTube stars become-- start

00:17:29.650 --> 00:17:31.060
out, I mean that's what it is.

00:17:31.060 --> 00:17:31.560
Right?

00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:33.680
A guy on a camera
and I can do this.

00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:37.780
And one thing led to another in
terms of your media presence.

00:17:37.780 --> 00:17:40.430
JALEN ROSE: And also too is
the ability to multitask.

00:17:40.430 --> 00:17:43.290
That's the one
thing that I think

00:17:43.290 --> 00:17:49.260
young people should concentrate
on doing a better job of.

00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:52.070
Because as I sit here
right now, if you

00:17:52.070 --> 00:17:56.010
think about what I'm juggling--
so this is real time.

00:17:56.010 --> 00:17:58.660
I'm possibly going
to do more episodes

00:17:58.660 --> 00:18:01.000
of "To Tell The Truth" I
don't if you guys saw that

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:06.450
on ABC with Betty White and
Anthony Anderson-- Jalen

00:18:06.450 --> 00:18:10.580
and Jacoby, which was a
podcast five years ago.

00:18:10.580 --> 00:18:16.830
It became a radio show from 7:00
to 9:00 Eastern, September 28.

00:18:16.830 --> 00:18:18.490
And then they
appreciated it so much,

00:18:18.490 --> 00:18:20.895
they made it a television
show January 28.

00:18:20.895 --> 00:18:23.870
We come on every
night on ESPN 2,

00:18:23.870 --> 00:18:25.620
and every morning on ESPN News.

00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:27.830
It's the off season for the NBA.

00:18:27.830 --> 00:18:32.950
But I do ABC, "ESPN Countdown,"
in particular on weekends,

00:18:32.950 --> 00:18:35.550
and on Sundays, and obviously
we had the NBA finals.

00:18:35.550 --> 00:18:38.680
Which was a great NBA final
with Lebron James delivering

00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:40.520
a championship to Cleveland.

00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:45.750
So beyond that, I'm a dad,
I'm the founder of a school,

00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:48.480
I'm a son, I'm a brother.

00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:50.820
And so, juggling
all of those things

00:18:50.820 --> 00:18:53.010
you have to be
efficient, but also you

00:18:53.010 --> 00:18:55.990
have to have the
ability to multitask.

00:18:55.990 --> 00:18:58.050
Because a lot of times
when you go down one path,

00:18:58.050 --> 00:18:59.320
a lot of people get stuck.

00:18:59.320 --> 00:19:01.190
So for me, it was
communications.

00:19:01.190 --> 00:19:04.340
But it was radio, TV, and film.

00:19:04.340 --> 00:19:06.400
SPEAKER: That's quite
an impressive set

00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:09.934
of off-the-court accomplishments
and endeavors you've got going.

00:19:09.934 --> 00:19:11.350
I'm going to ask
one more question

00:19:11.350 --> 00:19:13.599
and then we'll open it up
to some live questions here.

00:19:13.599 --> 00:19:15.910
We were reflecting before
the start that-- you know,

00:19:15.910 --> 00:19:19.240
when you were in school in the
'90s-- in college for example,

00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:21.735
in the early '90s, e-mail
was just getting going.

00:19:21.735 --> 00:19:24.780
JALEN ROSE: We
had a floppy disk.

00:19:24.780 --> 00:19:26.090
SPEAKER: We had floppy disks.

00:19:26.090 --> 00:19:28.330
We were writing papers
with typewriters.

00:19:28.330 --> 00:19:29.650
JALEN ROSE: And I was determined
not to use one for a while,

00:19:29.650 --> 00:19:30.730
for some reason.

00:19:30.730 --> 00:19:31.980
I was like, I'm not
using no floppy disk.

00:19:31.980 --> 00:19:32.880
SPEAKER: And how
far you've come.

00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:33.980
Now you're the doctor.

00:19:33.980 --> 00:19:36.105
JALEN ROSE: I was like I
need to use a floppy disk.

00:19:36.105 --> 00:19:39.400
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:42.470
SPEAKER: So it strikes me that
there was a huge pivot there

00:19:42.470 --> 00:19:43.950
over the last 20 or so years.

00:19:43.950 --> 00:19:46.110
You've talked a lot
about television

00:19:46.110 --> 00:19:47.920
and your role in television.

00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:52.460
But I think one of the
things that really makes you

00:19:52.460 --> 00:19:54.820
the popular public figure
that you are is your candor.

00:19:54.820 --> 00:19:56.670
I mean, you don't need me
to tell you this obviously.

00:19:56.670 --> 00:19:58.878
You were talking about the
importance of authenticity

00:19:58.878 --> 00:20:00.040
and candor earlier.

00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:03.690
But with the explosion of
digital channels, social media

00:20:03.690 --> 00:20:08.510
presence, blogs, the digital
uploads of your TV productions,

00:20:08.510 --> 00:20:12.410
how do you think about how
to use technology today?

00:20:12.410 --> 00:20:14.260
Online specifically,
you talked a little bit

00:20:14.260 --> 00:20:15.520
about all your TV endeavors.

00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:17.450
But I'm sure this group would
be interested in a little bit

00:20:17.450 --> 00:20:18.720
about your thoughts
about online.

00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:20.610
And then we'll open it
up to group questions.

00:20:20.610 --> 00:20:23.330
JALEN ROSE: That's the
one thing in education

00:20:23.330 --> 00:20:26.380
that-- so there are a lot of
things that make JRLA unique,

00:20:26.380 --> 00:20:29.490
besides trying to
educate young people.

00:20:29.490 --> 00:20:31.250
We know that if
you go to school,

00:20:31.250 --> 00:20:33.270
you get your grades,
you graduate,

00:20:33.270 --> 00:20:35.456
put yourself in the position
to go off to college,

00:20:35.456 --> 00:20:36.410
and all of that.

00:20:36.410 --> 00:20:40.620
But there's just as equal
a portion of a life skill

00:20:40.620 --> 00:20:42.870
that you have to develop--
a leadership, which

00:20:42.870 --> 00:20:43.810
is in our title.

00:20:43.810 --> 00:20:47.810
So we have advisory
for our students.

00:20:47.810 --> 00:20:50.130
We also have a leadership
course for our students.

00:20:50.130 --> 00:20:53.510
We have multiple sports
and activities for students

00:20:53.510 --> 00:20:55.610
to participate in.

00:20:55.610 --> 00:20:59.960
The one thing that
schools and our government

00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:04.960
do a horrible job of
legislating is social media

00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:08.370
and how to teach young people
to use it to their benefit, not

00:21:08.370 --> 00:21:10.520
their detriment.

00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:12.560
That's exactly
what I say all day.

00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:13.260
SPEAKER: And that's
what you were

00:21:13.260 --> 00:21:14.870
talking about earlier--
once it's out there,

00:21:14.870 --> 00:21:15.880
it's tough to undo.

00:21:15.880 --> 00:21:16.713
JALEN ROSE: Correct.

00:21:16.713 --> 00:21:24.340
And so your social media
presence is now the new resume.

00:21:24.340 --> 00:21:26.230
That's exactly what it is.

00:21:26.230 --> 00:21:30.740
So what I do with
my presence, I make

00:21:30.740 --> 00:21:33.750
people feel like
they're following

00:21:33.750 --> 00:21:36.180
exactly what I'm doing.

00:21:36.180 --> 00:21:39.210
But I don't want people to know
where I'm at all of the time.

00:21:39.210 --> 00:21:42.910
I don't necessarily want
people to know what city I'm

00:21:42.910 --> 00:21:44.990
in all of the time.

00:21:44.990 --> 00:21:49.350
So what I do, I more use social
media, either professional

00:21:49.350 --> 00:21:50.400
or personal.

00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:52.370
That's it.

00:21:52.370 --> 00:21:54.800
There was a time when people
would say negative comments.

00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:57.500
I would fire back--
nah, just block 'em.

00:21:57.500 --> 00:21:59.833
Like if somebody would even
think about saying something

00:21:59.833 --> 00:22:01.390
negative, I'd just block 'em.

00:22:01.390 --> 00:22:04.180
But here is why.

00:22:04.180 --> 00:22:08.460
Your social media
is your timeline.

00:22:08.460 --> 00:22:11.160
So why am I going to have
somebody on my timeline,

00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:12.560
disrespecting me.

00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:13.870
That doesn't make sense.

00:22:13.870 --> 00:22:16.650
It's almost like you
disrespected me in my home.

00:22:16.650 --> 00:22:18.120
It doesn't make sense.

00:22:18.120 --> 00:22:23.280
And it takes so much-- negative
energy takes so much from you.

00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:26.810
It just [LOUDLY EXHALES]

00:22:26.810 --> 00:22:30.270
And so, everybody's
not rooting for you.

00:22:30.270 --> 00:22:32.320
Here's another thing
on social media.

00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:34.105
Everybody's not rooting
for your success.

00:22:34.105 --> 00:22:35.480
Everybody doesn't
want you to see

00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:37.640
you have your dream
job, your dream car,

00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:38.970
see you buy your mom a house.

00:22:38.970 --> 00:22:41.320
Everybody does not
want that for you.

00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:44.010
And so a term I
got from my sister

00:22:44.010 --> 00:22:46.592
that I always use is, people
come into your life for four

00:22:46.592 --> 00:22:50.950
reasons-- to add,
subtract, multiply,

00:22:50.950 --> 00:22:55.620
or divide-- choose wisely.

00:22:55.620 --> 00:22:58.100
And that's my approach
to social media.

00:22:58.100 --> 00:23:01.980
I'm giving you the information
I want you to have, not

00:23:01.980 --> 00:23:04.340
the other way around.

00:23:04.340 --> 00:23:06.430
So I'll go and see
what's trending

00:23:06.430 --> 00:23:11.570
or what may be a breaking
news story or whatnot.

00:23:11.570 --> 00:23:13.960
But usually when I'm
tweeting something,

00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:17.220
it's I'm tweeting to the
audience, not necessarily

00:23:17.220 --> 00:23:19.060
the other way around

00:23:19.060 --> 00:23:20.560
I do read my mentions.

00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:23.870
I do follow what's
happening on social media.

00:23:23.870 --> 00:23:27.470
I was somebody that back in
the day, I had a Myspace page.

00:23:27.470 --> 00:23:30.770
I have a YouTube page.

00:23:30.770 --> 00:23:33.550
But eventually,
I remember taking

00:23:33.550 --> 00:23:35.610
all of the time and energy
to make sure my albums

00:23:35.610 --> 00:23:38.090
and my pictures look
right on Myspace page.

00:23:38.090 --> 00:23:40.490
And I clicked on it one
day and it was gone.

00:23:40.490 --> 00:23:44.460
Like, I spent so much time
and energy on this page.

00:23:44.460 --> 00:23:48.820
Then when technology
changes, it all goes away.

00:23:48.820 --> 00:23:55.130
So use it as a tool but not as
something that all of a sudden,

00:23:55.130 --> 00:23:57.080
you find yourself muscle
memory looking down

00:23:57.080 --> 00:23:59.370
at your phone 50 times a day.

00:23:59.370 --> 00:24:02.000
Because that takes energy to do.

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:05.830
You don't realize-- just test
yourself, how many times am I

00:24:05.830 --> 00:24:07.729
looking down at my phone today?

00:24:07.729 --> 00:24:10.020
SPEAKER: I believe we've got
stats on that one for you.

00:24:10.020 --> 00:24:12.371
We can set you up with
some folks later today

00:24:12.371 --> 00:24:12.690
if you want to know a
little more about that.

00:24:12.690 --> 00:24:13.170
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:13.170 --> 00:24:15.045
JALEN ROSE: And I'm
looking at this audience.

00:24:15.045 --> 00:24:16.140
So let me just say this.

00:24:16.140 --> 00:24:18.390
Please raise your hand
if you have all three

00:24:18.390 --> 00:24:23.510
of these-- Twitter,
Instagram, and or Snap.

00:24:23.510 --> 00:24:25.470
SPEAKER: Twitter,
Instagram, and or Snap?

00:24:25.470 --> 00:24:26.220
JALEN ROSE: Right.

00:24:26.220 --> 00:24:27.110
SPEAKER: Most of the audience.

00:24:27.110 --> 00:24:28.824
JALEN ROSE: So just
think about it.

00:24:28.824 --> 00:24:30.490
That's three different
sites that you're

00:24:30.490 --> 00:24:32.440
keeping current all day.

00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:33.676
That's a job.

00:24:33.676 --> 00:24:35.450
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:35.450 --> 00:24:37.430
That's really taking
your time and energy.

00:24:37.430 --> 00:24:39.850
That takes a lot
of time and energy.

00:24:39.850 --> 00:24:42.180
The other thing I do with
social media-- and part of it

00:24:42.180 --> 00:24:42.935
is my age.

00:24:42.935 --> 00:24:44.560
I am getting older,
so I can't be doing

00:24:44.560 --> 00:24:45.680
everything the cool kids do.

00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:46.346
I don't want to.

00:24:46.346 --> 00:24:47.138
I know I'm not one.

00:24:47.138 --> 00:24:49.512
SPEAKER: You might be selling
yourself a little bit short

00:24:49.512 --> 00:24:51.180
there, but that's
just my point of view.

00:24:51.180 --> 00:24:52.780
JALEN ROSE: So like,
I pick and choose

00:24:52.780 --> 00:24:54.680
the mediums I want
to participate in.

00:24:54.680 --> 00:24:56.820
So when Twitter came out
initially I was like,

00:24:56.820 --> 00:24:58.576
I don't want to participate.

00:24:58.576 --> 00:24:59.950
Then I was like,
all right, cool.

00:24:59.950 --> 00:25:00.850
I can get into that.

00:25:00.850 --> 00:25:02.350
And I did it.

00:25:02.350 --> 00:25:04.260
When Instagram came out
I was like, I'm good.

00:25:04.260 --> 00:25:04.760
Pictures?

00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:05.740
I'm Good.

00:25:05.740 --> 00:25:06.964
No, I am good.

00:25:06.964 --> 00:25:08.380
Picture's worth a
thousand words--

00:25:08.380 --> 00:25:11.960
I don't want people tagging
me on pictures sometimes.

00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:13.630
And so when it first
came out, I decided

00:25:13.630 --> 00:25:15.480
I didn't want to
be a part of it.

00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:17.790
And so now when the
other things come,

00:25:17.790 --> 00:25:20.160
like Periscope or Snapchat,
I already just made my mind,

00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:22.610
I'm not dealing with 'em.

00:25:22.610 --> 00:25:26.160
But I could get the same
thing accomplished on Twitter.

00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:28.580
I could post a video,
I could post a message,

00:25:28.580 --> 00:25:31.420
you can make a longer link now.

00:25:31.420 --> 00:25:34.420
So I don't have to go to
three or four different sites

00:25:34.420 --> 00:25:36.430
to get out the same message.

00:25:36.430 --> 00:25:38.252
And also you're
dividing your followers.

00:25:38.252 --> 00:25:39.460
You're dividing your message.

00:25:39.460 --> 00:25:42.020
You might have 200 people
following you here,

00:25:42.020 --> 00:25:44.380
400 people following
you here-- like

00:25:44.380 --> 00:25:46.977
imagine if you were able
to consolidate that.

00:25:46.977 --> 00:25:49.060
SPEAKER: It's back to one
of your earlier points--

00:25:49.060 --> 00:25:50.810
take a few things and
do them really well.

00:25:50.810 --> 00:25:51.650
JALEN ROSE: Correct.

00:25:51.650 --> 00:25:53.492
So that's my approach
to social media.

00:25:53.492 --> 00:25:54.200
SPEAKER: Alright.

00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:55.305
Well hopefully that provided--

00:25:55.305 --> 00:25:57.270
JALEN ROSE: And this is my
little brother and I love him.

00:25:57.270 --> 00:25:58.950
But I have to throw
a social media shout

00:25:58.950 --> 00:26:02.100
because I'm near the
University of Michigan.

00:26:02.100 --> 00:26:04.320
And we saw my brother
Draymond Green, the post

00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:05.530
that he did on Snapchat.

00:26:05.530 --> 00:26:07.260
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:07.260 --> 00:26:09.340
You know what I'm saying?

00:26:09.340 --> 00:26:10.669
I didn't see the picture.

00:26:10.669 --> 00:26:12.710
Heard it wasn't his best
performance-- best work.

00:26:12.710 --> 00:26:13.620
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:13.620 --> 00:26:14.930
I didn't see that picture.

00:26:14.930 --> 00:26:16.650
I'm just saying.

00:26:16.650 --> 00:26:22.320
So those are the type of
things though that can-- see,

00:26:22.320 --> 00:26:25.064
he's an all-star
basketball player.

00:26:25.064 --> 00:26:27.230
So you know what's going
to happen when he does his.

00:26:27.230 --> 00:26:28.740
He didn't commit a crime.

00:26:28.740 --> 00:26:31.490
His job's going to say he's one
of the best at what he does.

00:26:31.490 --> 00:26:34.170
No big deal-- when
does Team USA practice.

00:26:34.170 --> 00:26:36.790
But that happened to you?

00:26:36.790 --> 00:26:39.090
You're going to get fired.

00:26:39.090 --> 00:26:42.690
And so that is the
tug-of-war that

00:26:42.690 --> 00:26:47.850
truly happens with social media
that you have to be careful.

00:26:47.850 --> 00:26:50.980
I've been influencing young
people via scholarship

00:26:50.980 --> 00:26:55.810
through public schools
since about 2002.

00:26:55.810 --> 00:26:58.040
We influenced around 40 kids.

00:26:58.040 --> 00:27:01.640
And really just, JRLA became
a graduation of that mission.

00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:03.980
I never thought that
I'd be the founder

00:27:03.980 --> 00:27:05.289
of a charter high school.

00:27:05.289 --> 00:27:06.830
You guys ever saw
me play in college,

00:27:06.830 --> 00:27:09.740
I know y'all didn't ever think
I'd be the founder of a charter

00:27:09.740 --> 00:27:10.810
high school.

00:27:10.810 --> 00:27:16.750
So now for young people,
they unfortunately

00:27:16.750 --> 00:27:20.950
get a chance to get so
exposed to adult situations

00:27:20.950 --> 00:27:26.560
early-- the language,
the nudity-- you

00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:30.430
go through the guide,
boom, "Dating Naked."

00:27:30.430 --> 00:27:34.400
Like seriously, it's an
actual show on television.

00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:36.800
Like how can you seriously
date somebody naked?

00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:38.435
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:38.435 --> 00:27:39.310
You know what I mean?

00:27:39.310 --> 00:27:41.090
SPEAKER: We got a whole
different set of considerations

00:27:41.090 --> 00:27:42.975
on these topics as
parents today, right?

00:27:42.975 --> 00:27:43.725
JALEN ROSE: Right?

00:27:43.725 --> 00:27:47.930
But behind that is
an undercurrent of,

00:27:47.930 --> 00:27:50.280
the young people are
listening and watching.

00:27:50.280 --> 00:27:54.110
So when I was young and
my favorite artist cursed,

00:27:54.110 --> 00:27:57.300
I could just hide
the tape from my mom.

00:27:57.300 --> 00:27:59.560
Where now, it's on the radio.

00:27:59.560 --> 00:28:02.260
Now they're cussing
on television.

00:28:02.260 --> 00:28:06.090
Now you get a chance to see more
nudity and things like that.

00:28:06.090 --> 00:28:11.650
So you have young people--
you know, 8 through 15--

00:28:11.650 --> 00:28:17.590
being exposed to these
situations-- and drugs also.

00:28:17.590 --> 00:28:22.570
Vaping, smoking,
drinking, lean, perks,

00:28:22.570 --> 00:28:24.657
zans-- everything
Future raps about.

00:28:24.657 --> 00:28:25.740
Whatever Future rap about.

00:28:25.740 --> 00:28:28.300
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:28.300 --> 00:28:28.840
Right?

00:28:28.840 --> 00:28:30.800
Whatever he raps about.

00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:34.110
And so now you throw that in.

00:28:34.110 --> 00:28:36.300
So you've got social
media, you have

00:28:36.300 --> 00:28:38.340
what they're being
exposed to, and now

00:28:38.340 --> 00:28:42.180
you have a young mind,
just 16 years old,

00:28:42.180 --> 00:28:44.090
just so much happening.

00:28:44.090 --> 00:28:47.180
And so now you
throw social media

00:28:47.180 --> 00:28:51.050
in there, that becomes
a volatile cocktail.

00:28:51.050 --> 00:28:52.480
SPEAKER: Indeed it does.

00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:55.145
Social media Do's and
Don'ts from Jalen Rose.

00:28:55.145 --> 00:28:56.360
How good is that, huh?

00:28:56.360 --> 00:28:57.776
Alright, we're
going to open it up

00:28:57.776 --> 00:28:59.680
to questions from
the live audience.

00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:01.350
A couple things
that I loved-- we've

00:29:01.350 --> 00:29:03.650
got a mic that will
start circulating here.

00:29:03.650 --> 00:29:05.240
A couple pearls of
wisdom from Jalen

00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:07.615
that really resonated with
me-- "Find a couple things you

00:29:07.615 --> 00:29:10.860
do really well, and
do them really well,"

00:29:10.860 --> 00:29:13.230
"Have fun, maybe
have a lot of fun,

00:29:13.230 --> 00:29:15.804
but then [INAUDIBLE]
that hard work."

00:29:15.804 --> 00:29:17.220
I like that play
the heal comment,

00:29:17.220 --> 00:29:19.240
and then make it happen.

00:29:19.240 --> 00:29:21.110
I loved the send
me the camera line.

00:29:21.110 --> 00:29:25.700
To me that was so representative
of the power of digital today.

00:29:25.700 --> 00:29:27.500
Just send me the
camera and I can do it.

00:29:27.500 --> 00:29:28.625
And I will prove it to you.

00:29:28.625 --> 00:29:31.120
And look at what's
happened since in terms

00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:33.470
of Jalen's broadcasting career.

00:29:33.470 --> 00:29:36.060
And then I loved the advice
from your family member

00:29:36.060 --> 00:29:39.360
about four reasons people are
in your life-- their's add,

00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:41.540
subtract, multiply, or divide.

00:29:41.540 --> 00:29:44.300
Choose those folks
wisely as you think

00:29:44.300 --> 00:29:45.980
about who you want
to let in and how

00:29:45.980 --> 00:29:47.370
they're going to influence you.

00:29:47.370 --> 00:29:50.790
So with that, to paraphrase
the title of your book,

00:29:50.790 --> 00:29:52.290
let's give the
people what they want

00:29:52.290 --> 00:29:54.170
and nothing about my questions.

00:29:54.170 --> 00:29:55.212
Let's go to the audience.

00:29:55.212 --> 00:29:57.795
AUDIENCE: Hi Jalen, we actually
have a lot of former teachers,

00:29:57.795 --> 00:29:59.070
surprisingly, in this office.

00:29:59.070 --> 00:29:59.945
JALEN ROSE: Oh great.

00:29:59.945 --> 00:30:02.350
AUDIENCE: And then we also
have-- I know a ton of people

00:30:02.350 --> 00:30:04.320
with a heart for the
surrounding community.

00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:05.390
JALEN ROSE: We're looking
for a forensics teacher

00:30:05.390 --> 00:30:06.348
and an algebra teacher.

00:30:06.348 --> 00:30:09.080
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:09.080 --> 00:30:11.132
I'm founder of a school.

00:30:11.132 --> 00:30:13.090
AUDIENCE: What I was
specifically wondering is,

00:30:13.090 --> 00:30:16.140
are there any partnership
opportunities for needs

00:30:16.140 --> 00:30:18.260
that the JRLA might have?

00:30:18.260 --> 00:30:20.530
JALEN ROSE: I think
one of the main needs,

00:30:20.530 --> 00:30:22.850
if we have a lot
of teachers in here

00:30:22.850 --> 00:30:26.390
that want to influence our
students, would be tutor.

00:30:26.390 --> 00:30:30.690
Because we're sending young
people home with lessons,

00:30:30.690 --> 00:30:32.730
at some point, like you
did with your parents,

00:30:32.730 --> 00:30:34.620
that they can't help you with.

00:30:34.620 --> 00:30:37.770
And so any tutoring
really helps.

00:30:37.770 --> 00:30:40.480
Any mentoring really helps.

00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:43.070
Because young people
need that guidance,

00:30:43.070 --> 00:30:44.410
they appreciate that support.

00:30:44.410 --> 00:30:48.070
So those would be probably
the two main things.

00:30:48.070 --> 00:30:49.070
AUDIENCE: Hey, Jalen.

00:30:49.070 --> 00:30:50.300
JALEN ROSE: Thank you for
making sure I was good

00:30:50.300 --> 00:30:51.216
when I got here today.

00:30:51.216 --> 00:30:53.820
AUDIENCE: You know I
got you man, I got you.

00:30:53.820 --> 00:30:55.690
Full service here.

00:30:55.690 --> 00:30:58.050
Thanks again for coming.

00:30:58.050 --> 00:30:59.860
I read your book-- it's awesome.

00:30:59.860 --> 00:31:04.160
I found very interesting the
part where you also you talk

00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:06.530
about growing up a have not.

00:31:06.530 --> 00:31:08.810
And then slowly,
your eyes are opening

00:31:08.810 --> 00:31:12.250
to what's happening--
what other people have.

00:31:12.250 --> 00:31:16.300
So your school is
high school-- you

00:31:16.300 --> 00:31:20.000
say that the eight years from
high school to college-- those

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:22.420
are probably the most important
years of your life, when

00:31:22.420 --> 00:31:25.230
you become a man, a woman.

00:31:25.230 --> 00:31:28.740
Coming from an impoverished
background myself,

00:31:28.740 --> 00:31:32.740
it's kind of easy to,
once your eyes are open,

00:31:32.740 --> 00:31:35.710
to fall into an
nihilistic viewpoint--

00:31:35.710 --> 00:31:39.204
like, there's no way
I'm going out here.

00:31:39.204 --> 00:31:44.730
How-- what-- what
am I trying to say?

00:31:44.730 --> 00:31:49.380
At your school, how can you
go about teaching young people

00:31:49.380 --> 00:31:51.500
to not fall into that trap?

00:31:51.500 --> 00:31:52.430
Does that make sense?

00:31:52.430 --> 00:31:53.388
JALEN ROSE: Absolutely.

00:31:53.388 --> 00:31:55.870
You have to be a leader,
stop making excuses.

00:31:55.870 --> 00:31:59.880
Those two things
go hand in hand.

00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:01.540
In my life, I try
to divide things

00:32:01.540 --> 00:32:03.545
between reasons and excuses.

00:32:06.410 --> 00:32:08.240
Some things, you can't control.

00:32:08.240 --> 00:32:15.610
Now there is an inherent
thing that finance

00:32:15.610 --> 00:32:19.430
creates that puts you in a
position to where now you

00:32:19.430 --> 00:32:22.700
live in an impoverished
neighborhood, which sends you

00:32:22.700 --> 00:32:25.120
to a poor-performing school.

00:32:25.120 --> 00:32:27.100
Your parents probably
don't have the jobs

00:32:27.100 --> 00:32:29.480
that they hoped that
they would have.

00:32:29.480 --> 00:32:31.770
They probably don't
have the outlook

00:32:31.770 --> 00:32:38.020
that you would deem that's
a normal background to raise

00:32:38.020 --> 00:32:40.120
young people to be successful.

00:32:40.120 --> 00:32:44.460
You have a lot of [INAUDIBLE]
a lot of single parent homes.

00:32:44.460 --> 00:32:47.370
So at some point
in your life, you

00:32:47.370 --> 00:32:50.030
have to start taking
responsibility for you.

00:32:50.030 --> 00:32:54.130
And I think that really
starts around ninth grade.

00:32:54.130 --> 00:32:56.950
Because only so long you
can blame your uncle,

00:32:56.950 --> 00:33:00.100
you can blame your mom, you
can blame your circumstance.

00:33:00.100 --> 00:33:03.810
When you have a chance now
to fix your circumstance.

00:33:03.810 --> 00:33:08.090
And for young people,
your report card

00:33:08.090 --> 00:33:11.400
is your paycheck when
you're in high school.

00:33:11.400 --> 00:33:15.080
That's the equivalent to an
adult working-- you showing up

00:33:15.080 --> 00:33:17.420
to school every day, you
taking care of your lessons,

00:33:17.420 --> 00:33:19.560
you're taking care
of your grades.

00:33:19.560 --> 00:33:21.640
Try to get you a summer job.

00:33:21.640 --> 00:33:22.850
Try to keep your nose clean.

00:33:22.850 --> 00:33:25.400
Surround yourself with
responsible, disciplined

00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:26.180
people.

00:33:26.180 --> 00:33:28.850
So these are decisions you
can make in ninth great.

00:33:28.850 --> 00:33:30.450
I remember being in ninth grade.

00:33:30.450 --> 00:33:31.936
And all of those
things were there.

00:33:31.936 --> 00:33:34.060
There were people smoking,
there people having sex,

00:33:34.060 --> 00:33:35.150
there were people
drinking, there were

00:33:35.150 --> 00:33:36.730
all of those things happening.

00:33:36.730 --> 00:33:39.930
But at some point,
you have to decide,

00:33:39.930 --> 00:33:43.860
is that going to take you away
from your dreams or your goals?

00:33:43.860 --> 00:33:47.930
And when your goals become
the most important thing--

00:33:47.930 --> 00:33:51.454
not to your mother or father,
not to your coach your mentor--

00:33:51.454 --> 00:33:53.620
but when your dreams become
the most important thing

00:33:53.620 --> 00:33:56.440
to you, then to
me, that puts you

00:33:56.440 --> 00:33:59.620
on a path to actually
try to pursue them.

00:33:59.620 --> 00:34:01.665
SPEAKER: Well we love
that Jalen has taken us

00:34:01.665 --> 00:34:03.790

demonstrate his passion--

00:34:03.790 --> 00:34:04.310

00:34:04.310 --> 00:34:08.198
--for education in
southeastern Michigan.

00:34:08.198 --> 00:34:09.989
Jalen, again, thank
you so much for coming.

00:34:09.989 --> 00:34:11.697
JALEN ROSE: Thank you
guys for having me.

00:34:11.697 --> 00:34:14.510
