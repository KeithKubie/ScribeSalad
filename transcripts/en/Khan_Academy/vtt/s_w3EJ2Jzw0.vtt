00:00:00.147 --> 00:00:01.935
- [Voiceover] What I wanna do with this video is look

00:00:01.935 --> 00:00:04.907
at some examples of data represented in different ways,

00:00:04.907 --> 00:00:07.670
and think about which representation is the best,

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:10.921
or can help us answer different questions?

00:00:10.921 --> 00:00:12.779
So we see this first example.

00:00:12.779 --> 00:00:14.984
A statistician recorded the length of each

00:00:14.984 --> 00:00:17.623
of Pixar's first 14 films.

00:00:17.623 --> 00:00:21.757
The statistician made a dot plot, each dot is a film,

00:00:21.757 --> 00:00:23.961
a histogram, and a box plot

00:00:23.961 --> 00:00:26.423
to display the running time data.

00:00:26.423 --> 00:00:30.254
Which display could be used to find the median?

00:00:30.254 --> 00:00:31.531
To find the median.

00:00:31.531 --> 00:00:34.572
All right, so let's look at these displays.

00:00:34.572 --> 00:00:38.171
So over here we see, this is the dot plot.

00:00:38.171 --> 00:00:40.400
We have a dot for each of the 14 films.

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:43.996
So one film had a running time of 81 minutes.

00:00:43.996 --> 00:00:44.882
We see that there.

00:00:44.882 --> 00:00:47.064
One film had a running time of 92.

00:00:47.064 --> 00:00:50.083
One had a running time of 93.

00:00:50.083 --> 00:00:52.544
We see one had a running time of 95.

00:00:52.544 --> 00:00:55.841
We see two had running times of 96 minutes,

00:00:55.841 --> 00:00:57.931
and so on and so forth.

00:00:57.931 --> 00:01:01.042
So I claim that I could use this to figure out the median,

00:01:01.042 --> 00:01:03.875
because I could make a list of all of the running times

00:01:03.875 --> 00:01:05.941
of the films, I could order them,

00:01:05.941 --> 00:01:07.503
and then I could find the middle value.

00:01:07.503 --> 00:01:08.565
I could literally make a list.

00:01:08.565 --> 00:01:12.234
I could write down 81, and then write down 92,

00:01:12.234 --> 00:01:14.927
then write down 93, then write down 95,

00:01:14.927 --> 00:01:16.947
then I could write down 96 twice,

00:01:16.947 --> 00:01:19.302
and then I could write down 98,

00:01:19.302 --> 00:01:20.430
then I could write down 100.

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.682
I think you see where this is going.

00:01:22.682 --> 00:01:24.540
I could write out the entire list,

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.537
and then I could find the middle values.

00:01:26.537 --> 00:01:31.134
So the dot plot, I could definitely use to find the median.

00:01:31.134 --> 00:01:32.574
Now, what about the histogram?

00:01:32.574 --> 00:01:35.313
This is the histogram right over here.

00:01:35.313 --> 00:01:38.146
And the key here is, for a median, to figure out a median,

00:01:38.146 --> 00:01:40.415
I just need to figure out a list of numbers.

00:01:40.415 --> 00:01:41.722
I need to figure out a list of numbers.

00:01:41.722 --> 00:01:45.089
So here, I don't know, they say I have one film

00:01:45.089 --> 00:01:47.410
that's between 80 and 85,

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:49.339
but I don't know its exact running time.

00:01:49.339 --> 00:01:52.101
Its running time might have been 81 minutes,

00:01:52.101 --> 00:01:54.608
its running time might have been 84 minutes.

00:01:54.608 --> 00:01:58.299
So I don't know here, and so I can't really make a list

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:00.111
of the running times of the films

00:02:00.111 --> 00:02:01.504
and find the middle values,

00:02:01.504 --> 00:02:02.683
so I don't think I'm gonna be able

00:02:02.683 --> 00:02:04.609
to do it using the histogram.

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:08.586
Now, with the box plot right over here,

00:02:08.586 --> 00:02:10.164
so I'm not gonna click histogram.

00:02:10.164 --> 00:02:11.721
With the box plot over here,

00:02:11.721 --> 00:02:14.358
I might not be able to make a list of all the values,

00:02:14.358 --> 00:02:17.781
but the box plot explicitly tells us what the median is.

00:02:17.781 --> 00:02:20.428
This middle line in the middle of the box,

00:02:20.428 --> 00:02:23.168
that tells us the median is, what is this,

00:02:23.168 --> 00:02:26.744
this median is, if this is 100, this is 99.

00:02:26.744 --> 00:02:29.832
So this is 95, 96, 97, 98, 99.

00:02:29.832 --> 00:02:32.061
It explicitly tells us the median is 99.

00:02:32.061 --> 00:02:34.894
This is actually the easiest for calculating the median.

00:02:34.894 --> 00:02:36.287
So I'll go with the box plot.

00:02:36.287 --> 00:02:38.353
So the histogram is of no use to me

00:02:38.353 --> 00:02:40.001
if I wanna calculate the median.

00:02:40.001 --> 00:02:41.929
Let's do a couple more of these.

00:02:41.929 --> 00:02:44.808
Nam owns a used car lot.

00:02:44.808 --> 00:02:46.596
He checked the odometers of the cars

00:02:46.596 --> 00:02:49.127
and recorded how far they had driven.

00:02:49.127 --> 00:02:51.936
He then created both a histogram and a box plot

00:02:51.936 --> 00:02:55.268
to display the same data, both diagrams are shown below.

00:02:55.998 --> 00:02:58.194
Which display can be used

00:02:58.194 --> 00:03:00.889
to find how many vehicles had driven

00:03:00.889 --> 00:03:04.139
more than 200,000 kilometers?

00:03:04.139 --> 00:03:06.158
So how many vehicles had driven

00:03:06.158 --> 00:03:09.525
more than 200,000 kilometers?

00:03:09.525 --> 00:03:13.264
So it looks like here in this histogram,

00:03:13.264 --> 00:03:16.700
I have three vehicles that were between 200 and 250,

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:20.415
and then I have two vehicles that are between 250 and 300.

00:03:20.415 --> 00:03:22.158
So it looks pretty clear that I have five vehicles,

00:03:22.158 --> 00:03:26.105
three that had a mileage between 200,000 and 250,000,

00:03:26.105 --> 00:03:27.938
and then I had two that had mileage

00:03:27.938 --> 00:03:30.115
between 250,000 and 300,000.

00:03:30.115 --> 00:03:31.507
So I may be able to answer the question.

00:03:31.507 --> 00:03:36.368
Five vehicles had a mileage more than 200,000,

00:03:36.368 --> 00:03:40.036
and so I would say that the histogram is pretty useful.

00:03:40.036 --> 00:03:42.915
But let's verify that the box plot isn't so useful.

00:03:42.915 --> 00:03:45.029
So I wanna know how many vehicles had a mileage

00:03:45.029 --> 00:03:47.141
more than 200,000.

00:03:47.141 --> 00:03:50.880
Well, I know that if I have a mileage more than 200,000,

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:54.943
I'm going to be in the fourth quartile,

00:03:54.943 --> 00:03:58.194
but I don't know how many values I have sitting there

00:03:58.194 --> 00:04:01.583
in the fourth quartile just looking at this data over here,

00:04:01.583 --> 00:04:04.671
so that's not gonna be useful for answering that question.

00:04:04.671 --> 00:04:06.227
Let's look at the second question.

00:04:06.227 --> 00:04:07.690
Which display can be used

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:09.518
to find that the median distance,

00:04:09.518 --> 00:04:11.478
which display can be used to find

00:04:11.478 --> 00:04:12.478
that the median distance

00:04:12.478 --> 00:04:15.420
was approximately 140,000 kilometers?

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:16.744
Well, to calculate the median,

00:04:16.744 --> 00:04:18.716
you essentially wanna be able to list all of the numbers

00:04:18.716 --> 00:04:20.250
and then find the middle number.

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:23.315
And over here, I can't list all of the numbers.

00:04:23.315 --> 00:04:25.405
I know that there's three values that are

00:04:25.405 --> 00:04:27.541
between zero and 50,000 kilometers,

00:04:27.541 --> 00:04:28.585
but I don't know what they are.

00:04:28.585 --> 00:04:30.792
Could be 10,000, 10,000, 10,000.

00:04:30.792 --> 00:04:34.483
It could be 10,000, 15,000, and 40,000.

00:04:34.483 --> 00:04:37.020
I don't know what they are, and so if I can't list all

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:39.142
of these things and put them in order,

00:04:39.146 --> 00:04:42.228
I really am going to have trouble finding the middle value.

00:04:42.228 --> 00:04:45.392
The middle value, it's going to be

00:04:45.392 --> 00:04:47.783
in this range right around here,

00:04:47.783 --> 00:04:49.687
but I don't know exactly what it's going to be.

00:04:49.687 --> 00:04:50.964
The histogram is not useful,

00:04:50.964 --> 00:04:53.918
because throwing all the values into these buckets.

00:04:53.918 --> 00:04:56.258
While on the box plot, it explicitly,

00:04:56.258 --> 00:04:58.116
it directly tells me the median value.

00:04:58.116 --> 00:05:00.508
This line right over here, the middle of the box,

00:05:00.508 --> 00:05:02.737
this tells us the median value,

00:05:02.737 --> 00:05:05.034
and we see that the median value here,

00:05:05.034 --> 00:05:08.425
this is 140,000 kilometers.

00:05:08.425 --> 00:05:11.341
Right, this is 100, 110, 120, 130,

00:05:11.341 --> 00:05:16.011
140,000 kilometers is the median mileage for the cars.

00:05:16.011 --> 00:05:18.808
And so the box plot clearly...

00:05:20.835 --> 00:05:23.242
clearly gives us that data.
