00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.380
 . 

00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.655
 Let's put some line equations into the point-tilt model 

00:00:04.655 --> 00:00:07.540
 . 

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:12.645
 This is different from the Y model or the intersection of inclination 

00:00:12.645 --> 00:00:15.650
 Model of intersection of inclination 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:18.200
 But they are actually two different ways to write 

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:19.330
 Equation itself 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:21.220
 We will see this through a set of examples 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:24.450
 Perhaps you remember that the model of the intersection of inclination is about 

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:30.030
 Equations on model image, y = mx + b - We have done 

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:33.280
 This is in the last view - when m was the tilt, and b is 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:34.850
 Intersection y 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:36.060
 For this reason the intersection is called tilt 

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:38.320
 Where we have the inclination and intersection 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:46.650
 Model tilt point, takes the shape y-y1 --- and 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:52.680
 I'll tell you what y1 is fast - = m × x 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:01:00.590
 - x1, where point x1, y1 falls on line 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:03.530
 This is why it is called the tilt point model 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.440
 Now, there are two different ways to write 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:07.520
 the same thing 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.960
 You can always manipulate it compulsively to get it 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.870
 Or to manipulate it so you get it 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:15.800
 I will show you this through a set of examples 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.960
 But let's put a set in a point-tilt model, so we make 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.140
 Things are clear in your mind 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.030
 If we have here a 1 / 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:29.160
 10, if m = -1.10 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.460
 And passes point 10.2 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.320
 We can go directly to the model point of inclination 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:37.430
 Let's take a point 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:41.470
 The point here is 10.2 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:45.470
 We can go directly to the model point of inclination. y - 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:47.730
 This is the y value that is on the line 

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:53.730
 If y-2 is equal to inclination, -1 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:02:01.530
 / 10 x x - x value, x x - 10 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:02.020
 So 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.780
 We're done 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.650
 We put it in a model 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:08.410
 There are two things I want to point out to them 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:09.610
 The first thing, why this makes sense 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:11.150
 I also want to show you that 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:12.300
 Equal to that 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.910
 So what is the first thing that makes sense? 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:17.920
 Well, all that is said here, if you split both ends 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:24.710
 Equation on it, you will get y2 / x - 

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:27.880
 10 = 1 / 10- 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:32.540
 Or you will get a change in y between any point and 2, and 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.380
 Point 2, / change in x 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:40.400
 If you get the change in y / change in x for any 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:46.200
 Point for x, y on that line, relative to point 10, 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.690
 2, will become 1 / 10- 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:52.370
 This is the definition of inclination 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:53.580
 I hope I did not fight you here 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.720
 I'll show you that just use this to define 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.190
 The tendency is to be equal to the line 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.140
 Now, the last thing I want to explain to you is that this 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.100
 Equally equal to that 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.110
 We can manipulate it so we get it 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:07.060
 Let us do that 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:10.280
 This is the answer to the question 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.340
 But let's manipulate it even geographically 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:13.780
 We get out this picture 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:17.170
 If we get y - 2 = - let us distribute 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:18.720
 1 / 10- 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.640
 It's 1 / 10x-, then 1 / 10- 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:26.020
 × 10 = positive 1 

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:28.990
 Now we can add 2 to both ends of the equation 

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:34.850
 We get y = -1 / 10x + 3 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:37.370
 By manipulating them geographically, we will be able 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:39.830
 To put them in the tilt point model 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:43.750
 If these are exactly equal 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:47.680
 Let's solve more questions. The line contains 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.630
 The points are 10,12 and 5.25 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:53.040
 Let's find the inclination 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:59.060
 The slope, which is equal to the change in y / change in 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:03.000
 x, = - Well, let's use this point first 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:19.870
 Let it be 12 - 25/10 - 5 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:25.760
 This equals -12 - 25 = -13 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:29.530
 / 10 - 5 = 5 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:32.270
 If the tendency here is 13 / 5- 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:34.980
 Let's put it in the model of the point of inclination, the equation 

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:39.040
 Will be y - - let us use this point - 

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:46.440
 y = 25 = mile I / 13 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:51.690
 × x - this point, ie 5 

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:56.350
 We know that point 5.25 is on the line 

00:04:56.350 --> 00:05:00.890
 If y-25 = inclination, we created it 

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:02.850
 X x - 5 

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:04.060
 And Antina 

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:04.650
 This is 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:07.580
 If you want, you can use algebra to 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:10.470
 Put it in the cross-slope model, Lee 

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:13.930
 In MX + B, you see them 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:16.460
 Are quite equal 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:18.770
 Let's solve one another 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:20.050
 He gave us the inclination 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:23.700
 Which is 3/5, the y-junction is -3 

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:25.945
 If here, directly, this seems easy to put 

00:05:25.945 --> 00:05:27.420
 In the cross-slope model 

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:35.020
 Model of intersection of inclination 

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:40.650
 The equation of this line is y = inclination 3 / 5x 

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:43.200
 + Intersection y, i-3 

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:44.070
 We will be finished 

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:47.590
 But how do you put it in the tilt point model? 

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:53.190
 Point of inclination 

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:54.830
 Well, we know the inclination 

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:56.950
 We know that m = 3/5 

00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:59.670
 We know that m = 3/5 

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:01.750
 But do you know any point on this line? 

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:04.150
 We need a point and inclination to put it in 

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:05.660
 Model tilt point 

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:07.180
 Well, we know one point 

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:08.300
 Know the intersection of y 

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:10.150
 The y-junction is -3 

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:13.420
 This means that when x = 0, the y = -3 

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:16.520
 If the point is, 0, -3 

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:18.120
 You can try to find other points 

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:20.450
 You can say, oh, when x = 5 

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:21.500
 The y = 0 

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:24.090
 These are all the things that you can try 

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:26.500
 But these are located here 

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:27.840
 The intersection of y is -3 

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:31.640
 That means that point 0, -3 is located on the line 

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:34.180
 Let's write it down on the point-of-tilt model 

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:42.150
 y - y value of this, if y - - 3 = 

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:48.080
 Tilt 3/5 × x - this x value, this 

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:52.000
 Axis x, x - 0 

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.420
 This is a point-tilt model 

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:58.810
 It can be y + 3 = 3/5 × - we can 

00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:00.200
 We write x x - 0 

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:03.610
 If you really want to make it look like a model point of inclination 

00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:05.510
 This would be the model of the point of inclination, but it is somewhat naive 

00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:07.080
 Write x - 0 

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:09.936
 You can write y + 3 = 3 / 5x 

00:07:09.936 --> 00:07:13.290
 You can write y + 3 = 3 / 5x 

00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:15.380
 It's not 100% clear that it's a model image point of inclination 

00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:16.230
 right Now 

00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:18.480
 But I think you do not need to write x - 0 

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:21.870
 As it is clear, until you move from here to there, you should 

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:24.110
 You subtract 3 from both parties and you will get it 

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:25.920
 They are almost equal 

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:28.720
 I mean, they are equal in terms of representation 

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:30.750
 They are also equal in how they are written 

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:33.300
 You have to subtract 3 from both ends 

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:36.350
 Equation for those 

00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:37.770
 Let's solve one another 

00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:42.260
 Let's put this model as a point of inclination 

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.880
 We have given information 

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:48.570
 We gave the equation as f (x) 

00:07:48.570 --> 00:07:53.680
 In this equation, when x = -7, 

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:55.860
 f (x) = 5 

00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:59.580
 And tell us that when x = 

00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:03.810
 3, then f (x) = -4 

00:08:03.810 --> 00:08:08.220
 Thus, we can find the inclination first 

00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:14.895
 Inclination, equal to the change in y / change in x 

00:08:14.895 --> 00:08:15.950
 Let's do it 

00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:29.130
 It is 4 - 5/3 - 7 

00:08:29.130 --> 00:08:32.900
 It is equal to -4.5 = 

00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:34.460
 9 

00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:38.299
 Then 3 - 7, equal to 3 

00:08:38.299 --> 00:08:40.049
 + 7 = 10 

00:08:40.049 --> 00:08:42.870
 If the tilt is 9 / 10- 

00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:43.830
 And even put it in the tilt point model 

00:08:43.830 --> 00:08:45.083
 This is simple 

00:08:45.083 --> 00:08:52.000
 Model tilt point 

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.710
 Will be y - let us do it that way - y 

00:08:55.710 --> 00:09:01.770
 - - Ask her - 3 = - I will do this 

00:09:01.770 --> 00:09:06.480
 In green - = tilt, ie = 

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:16.415
 9/10, × x this - this is the coordinate 

00:09:16.415 --> 00:09:20.180
 x - 4 

00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:22.090
 Then we can shut it down 

00:09:22.090 --> 00:09:23.560
 This is a point-tilt model 

00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:26.050
 We can simplify this little negative 

00:09:26.050 --> 00:09:32.210
 We can rewrite it to y-3 = -9/10 

00:09:32.210 --> 00:09:35.330
 X x + 4 

00:09:35.330 --> 00:09:37.340
 We're done 

00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:38.000
 .
