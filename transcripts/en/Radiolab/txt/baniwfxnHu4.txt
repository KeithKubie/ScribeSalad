Speaker 1:          00:00          Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. This is more perfect a series about the cases that land in front of the Supreme Court and in this episode, which we might as well call penny on part two. We're going to take a deep dive into what might be the most horrible supreme court decision ever. An attempt 160 years after the fact in a Hilton hotel ballroom

Speaker 2:          00:27          to finally set it right.

Speaker 3:          00:31          [inaudible] do I know about the USA? I know about the government. Can you tell me about the constitution?

Speaker 4:          00:40          This is a case that split the United States into [inaudible] to the case in question is the dred Scott Case, which if you ask people, I was wondering if you've ever heard of the dread Scott Court case. The dread Scott sounds familiar, doesn't go well.

Speaker 5:          01:00          Nothing coming up, man. I don't know. My high school history teacher would be really mad at me right now. I don't know. I don't remember anything. I remember nothing.

Speaker 1:          01:08          We get a lot of people who are like, what's that like a civil rights thing?

Speaker 5:          01:12          Probably something to do with segregation. You're warm. I'm warm. What was it? Obama like? The name had some familiarity? Yes, yes. Straight. Okay,

Speaker 4:          01:21          that's great. What does that mean? Dred Scott? It's a name. I don't know. This is the first Emma here.

Speaker 2:          01:34          So what happens a lot of times is that people don't actually understand why they're free. I'm so dred Scott is one of those fundamental decisions that is, that blazed the groundwork for the reasons why we can live in a multicultural society. This is Ellie, Ms Doll. More perfect legal editor. But to really understand the case, you've got to go to a place called Fort Snelling.

Speaker 4:          02:01          It's a small army base, about 15 minutes north of the Minneapolis airport, freshly laid on the ground. And our producer, Julia Longoria took a trip there right over here. And this guy, I'm Richard Josey, manager of programs here at the Minnesota historical society gave her a tour. Yup. So what are we walking into now? So what you're getting ready to see right now is, uh, the space that we think, you know, it's probably weird dreading area. Scott, you know, where they live.

Speaker 1:          02:28          Before we go in. Can you just sort of set up, when in time are we, what's happening is the 1830s,

Speaker 4:          02:33          we're 30 years out from the civil war, 1830s, about half the states in the union have slavery about half don't. So it's this question that's kind of still an answered like should we be a free nation or should we be a slave nation? So there is a real tension here and there is a real understanding here that this might not work. And just as we're about to reach this breaking point, an army doctor named John Emerson, a white guy, definitely a white guy, slave owner, steps into free territory and arrived here to this army base, um, on a hill and he brings with him his one slave, dred Scott. Um, and now we're actually inside the fortress, if you will. And um, you know, all of the stone, all of the will windows, um, it's, it's Kinda like whenever I come here, I have this kinda cold feeling. Even when it's hot outside, he walks his up to the back of this one squat building on the far end of the base. Can you describe the, the room? I think we're probably looking at a maybe seven and a half foot ceiling.

Speaker 3:          03:58          Um,

Speaker 4:          03:59          what grain floor? Wood clapboard floor. Um, wood stone walls. It's a tiny room. A little bigger than a king bed. There's a fireplace, little tables and redwood cabinets. So this is, uh, this is a, this is a home. This is a kitchen. This is a laundry place. This is, you know, your one stop shop.

Speaker 3:          04:18          Uh,

Speaker 4:          04:20          and the reason this room is so important is because dred Scott living in this room for the first time in his life, he got a taste

Speaker 3:          04:30          [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          04:30          of what it might be like to be free. I mean, obviously he was still asleep, but Dr. Emerson would leave the fort for months at a time and have him work for other people. He had a degree of autonomy and Harriet and dread met here, right? Yeah. Yeah. When he was here, he met a girl, 1836, seven. Jeff, they met here. Richard, Josie likes to stand here and imagine just how that might've went down. I can imagine, you know, Harriet, uh, you know, haven't been here and uh, and dread being over by the store and, and having a conversation with some of the other black guys that was here. And, uh, I can imagine him saying, did you see the new girl s here is she comes walking by Geo? Who is that? I'm going to make her mind like, I can imagine him saying that over the next few years, dred and Harriet had two kids, both of them girls. And I personally, I think that what happened was children seem to change everything.

Speaker 3:          05:36          [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          05:37          so what ends up happening is that Dr. Emerson moves dred Scott and his family back to Missouri. They're back in a slave state and Dr. Emerson ends up passing away

Speaker 3:          05:50          [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          05:51          and it seems like his wife is gonna maybe sell dred Scott's daughters. So what

Speaker 6:          05:57          dred and Harriet Scott ended up deciding to do. The whole reason we know dread Scott's name is that they decide to sue for their own freedom.

Speaker 2:          06:07          That's a lawsuit that dred Scott had every right to believe that he would win. There was a doctrine called once free, always free, that the minute your foot landed in the snow of the north, the minute you and your owner walked into free territory, you were free and you could not be returned to a state of bondage.

Speaker 6:          06:30          This was a well known legal argument and in fact, dred Scott won at a lower court. So it goes all the way up to the Supreme Court and the Supreme Court says, no, you're still property. And the chief justice of the Supreme Court, Roger Tawny,

Speaker 2:          06:48          very famously, he says, the black man has no rights, that the white man is bound to respect tawny in a amazingly broad decision, not only slams the door on dred Scott's freedom, he slams the door on the potential for any African American free or not free to ever have full citizenship in this country.

Speaker 6:          07:14          And at that point in time at the highest court of the land to make that decision. That was putting a period on sort of this overarching battle between um, the north and the south. The for slavery and the abolition is, and so when this happens, now you start seeing civil war popping up

Speaker 3:          07:42          [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          07:42          now as far as dred Scott, that case is concerned, but speaking legally, the 13th and 14th amendments did come along and overturn it. But like that line, like the black man has no rights that a white man is bound to respect. Like you can't overturn that line. And these days, you know, as depending on swings and we see a rise in blatant, overt white nationalism more than scream does when people injured and violence over statues. This car plowed into a crowd of people. But that line still hovers above us all.

Speaker 1:          08:26          But suppose you're a direct descendant of that case, of that history. Suppose your name is Scott, your last name is tawny. What do you do with that particularly now? Like what do you do with that history? Do you ignore it? Is it not your problem or do you address it? And if you do, how coming up next after the break we walk into a hotel lobby in St Louis and get an answer. We just did not expect

Speaker 4:          09:05          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          09:09          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          09:09          or perfect. We'll continue in a moment.

Speaker 3:          09:22          [inaudible] [inaudible]

Speaker 7:          09:32          I'm Preet Bharara every weekend. My podcast, stay tuned. I answer your questions about what's really happening in Washington. I wonder if it is legal for president Trump to initiate north hairy action against North Korea. What happens if Mueller returns? I'm indictment again, the president. I just want to know are you a stable genius? Subscribe to stay tuned from cafe and W NYC studios.

Speaker 1:          10:05          This is more perfect. I'm Chad. I boom Rod. Okay. Now we come to the reunion as she was reporting this story producer Julia Longoria is doing a little googling, located a couple of Scott Tawny descendants and then found out that they were actually planning to meet up to have this kind of historic summit, which was like, we thought it was bananas. So she went and it was bananas. And as soon as she came back she sat down in the studio and told Elly Ms Doll and I all about it. Um, so where to start?

Speaker 4:          10:42          [inaudible] so I locked into this Hilton Frontenac hotel in St Louis? No, your classic hotel atrium. With like a very weird carpet pattern like, and I walk in and it's like, oh, drove in or you, it's almost like a conference and I'm greeted by the great, great granddaughter of Dred Scott. Wow. And uh, yeah, it's just amazing. I mean, literally this is our inaugural sons and daughters of reconciliation events. Names Lynn Jackson. She's the main organizer. This was always a dream that I had about 12 years ago. There's, I couldn't meet other descendants. Wouldn't that be cool? Then she immediately tells me, I'm a networker. I'm a networker. I'm going to connect you with everyone here. That's what I like doing. And this is a blow family right here. And immediately she introduces me to these three people. What's your name? Mimi laboratoire. John Lavar Schwab mashed in the bourgeois one who are descendants of the blow family, the first family who owned her.

Speaker 4:          11:44          Great. Great Grandpa. Here's some more fun gas. Hello guys. Come on in. She also introduced me to the great, great, great, great, great. Sixth grade grandson. Thomas Jefferson. Yeah. Grandson of Thomas Jefferson. I met, what's your name? I'm Bertram Hayes Davis. Hyphenate at descendant of Jefferson Davis. You know the guy who led the confederacy against the union in the civil war and everybody's hugging and laughing. It was wild. Almost like, it sounds like almost like a meaning of the Utopian society. Yes, exactly. And the whole idea, everyone kind of wanted reconciliation, reconciliation, reconciliation. That was like the word of the day, reconciliation, reconciliation. So the nation, I think they got a lot of the country needs that now. You know, so I think a lot of people here and so I'm wandering around and reading these people, like going up, shaking hands with random people. And then I meet this one guy, Scott Madison.

Speaker 4:          12:42          Lynn introduced us. Oh yes, your name dread Madison. I'm the great, great grandson of dread and Harry Scott. And I look in his eyes and I was like, Holy Shit. Those are dred Scott's eyes. I mean, there's really only one picture of dred Scott that exists and it's from around 1857 he's wearing a suit staring straight at the camera and his eyes are like almost glassy. Ms Pupils are really big. And it's just striking. I felt like I was looking bright into those same eyes. And have you always known that you're related to dread Scott? I imagine? Yes. And what, what's your relationship to that history? What do you, when you think about it, what do you, what do you feel? I have mixed feelings based on what [inaudible]

Speaker 8:          13:34          chief justice tardy said and the decision they made. A, you are subhuman species with no rights, a whiteness

Speaker 4:          13:39          boundary respect. Blacks have no rights that white men are bound to respect. That still resonates today in my opinion.

Speaker 9:          13:49          [inaudible]

Speaker 8:          13:49          what really hit me the hardest, and I, I it's hard meeting with think about this cause it, it just bothers me was the Trayvon Martin right on the line, a teenager was shot down by one name or one, one self defense. This kid was walking home from school, from a store, wasn't bothering, wasn't breaking any laws. Someone decided to follow him, pull up on him and he ended up murdering him. That guy parked his car, got out of his car, invaded the show me a space and murdered him and used to stand your ground law. And that's a perfect example of Ma, your ground is yours. Until I decided it's not.

Speaker 4:          14:28          I meet dread just as he is about to shake hands for the first time with the family who owned his family. A whole lot of stuff that goes through your mind. Are they going to be, are they going to be buddy heads? I think arrogance did that all go through your head, but you, you know you have to approach people. You have to approach people for who they are. You've got to have open mind and one of the most striking things I learned from dread Scott Junior, junior and also from my sister Barbara, I'm Barbara McGregory, I'm dread. Scott's great, great granddaughter is that the dred Scott history was actually something that was kind of kept from them. It was hush hush thing because the dred Scott decision, I don't know if you are understanding what that was, that that was the last straw that sparked the civil war. My Dad, when they were growing up, they had death strips, right? So they couldn't tell anybody who they were related to your dad. That generation. This was like a hundred years after the decision that generation had to keep it a secret. That's his great grandfather. His grandmother was dread. Scott's daughter, great dread junior. Junior, junior told me that his dad was actually partially raised by dread. Scott's daughter, Lizzy, whose name was Lizzie,

Speaker 8:          15:36          try to hide the fact. In fact, someone told me she was, she might've been kind of mad when, um, my, uh, grandfather and grandmother named my father dred Scott because she was in hiding. You gotta remember when she was, uh, six years old. They wouldn't hiding for five years during the trial earner sister because the whole basis of trial was he didn't want his family split up. So when he lost the second appeal, he sent the girls into hiding because he didn't want them sold away. So Lizzy stayed pretty much undercover. She lived in a, a little, little room, but she always had the shades close,

Speaker 4:          16:14          so dread. And Barbara told me their parents never talked about dred Scott. They never had a picture up in the house. They never even knew what he looked like. In fact, as we were standing there in the lobby of the Hilton, dread, pulls out his phone photos of dred Scott. Okay. Pictures of dred Scott. And he brings up the photo on Google. That's the actual photographs. That's the actual photograph, which looks, let's see. Looks like this. That's it. Yeah. So can you describe it?

Speaker 8:          16:49          Uh, really dark eyes. Um, he's wearing a suit.

Speaker 4:          16:54          Like he was impressed, I think. Like you wouldn't expect a slave to be dressed. So Nice. Wait, is that the first time you've seen the picture of dred Scott? No, it's not the first time, but it seemed like he was noticing things in it for the first time.

Speaker 8:          17:08          It looks really dignified and stern in that picture, but he looks, he looks like a man who's going through it and is ready to go through some more.

Speaker 3:          17:16          He does. [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          17:32          [inaudible] she has to have a separate project. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So at the end of the night, I ended up at the hotel bar with another descendant, so I let her answer that. Uh, no, I think you should answer that. So

Speaker 7:          17:50          the dred Scott Case is a famous supreme court case and the chief justice who ruled in that case was named Roger Protonix. And so I'm a tiny

Speaker 4:          18:01          Charlie Tani is the great, great grand nephew of Roger Brooke. Tony, who is the chief justice who basically denied dred Scott his freedom, right? He's kind of a tall guy. White hair. I'll take one more topic. Okay. Glasses on. Tip of his nose. You know, we had an 11 about original copy of that decision and he was actually sitting next to three descendants from the family who originally owned dread Scott. They were like, come join us. And so to my left is the descendant of the people who own dread Scott into my right are the people who kept dred Scott and slaved, are you not going to eat one of those? And they were all just like having gin and tonics and crap. Kate's outlet strategy. Remember that father says you have never dad. It's not even as packs. That's great. Can you, can you describe the first images you saw of Tony? Eventually I steer the conversation back to Charlie. Tanya's ancestor, Roger Tawny. The Supreme Court justice? Well, we had, we had, uh, we have pictures of them hanging on our hat on. I grew up in the house.

Speaker 6:          19:07          It was up on the wall and it had, I remember it had this a light over it, unlike the dread Scott family, Charlie Tawny and his daughter Kate, Kate Tani Billingsley grew up knowing exactly what Roger looks like. His skin flapped over and he had these long jowls, but he was also a thin man. He was very sickly. That's something I really recall. He looks like, um, spooked me. That shriveled up little, okay

Speaker 7:          19:33          man who lives up in the house on the hill that hardly ever comes out of his house. And all the kids are scared of you grew up, man, you know, in the once the first time you study the civil war, probably like fifth grade, sixth grade, and you're like sliding down in your seat when they get to the dred Scott decision because you know, this is really terrible. And that's my family. And I'm like, God, they did that. So that you're very aware of it. Yeah. And we're also, I mean, and we're also, you know, while while you're, um, well that's a black mark on our family. He also ran one of the most productive courts and it was during a time of explosive growth in the country. So we're very proud of his role and helping form America. What he's known for is the single worst decision ever made by the Supreme Court. If you're a family member, it's, it's, um, a little, a little difficult to have that be the only focus

Speaker 4:          20:28          fully sitting there. It was pretty clear that Charlie Tawny was kind of like dread. Scott Madison. He also had some mixed feelings.

Speaker 7:          20:35          Well, having read, having read a number of his letters, I, you know, I think he was, I think, you know, he, I think he really loved his wife and his family and I think he was a very loving father and he was against slavery is pretty clear. He thought it was a blot on the national character. He thought slavery was wrong. Are we talking about tiny still? Yeah. He, yeah, he felt it was wrong and should eventually be just done away with. He told me that in one of his legal arguments, tawny totally railed against slave drivers. He said something to the effect of, uh, these people are reptiles who deal in the trafficking of human flesh.

Speaker 6:          21:11          Sitting there, Charlie tells me that Roger Tawny was trying to save the Union, that somehow if he ruled that America was a slave ocracy once and for all really, that might somehow delay the civil war

Speaker 7:          21:27          and he was trying to solve the issue of slavery in America. That might be true, but you can't look for, look yes. When you read that language that he was a stone racist, I mean just was,

Speaker 6:          21:39          and um, and I asked them like, when you met the Scott's like, what did you feel like, what did you, did you feel like you wanted to communicate something to them? And the blow descendant, you know, the family who originally owned dred Scott said, yeah, like we're sorry. And I was like, have you ever, I turned to Tanya and said like, have you ever actually apologized? And he was like, I don't know.

Speaker 7:          22:07          I don't know if I ever use those words. I don't recall ever using those words.

Speaker 3:          22:16          [inaudible]

Speaker 6:          22:20          [inaudible] next day.

Speaker 7:          22:22          Well, welcome to the drags car reconciliation forum. I know, well these two at the forum, about a hundred people crammed into the grand ballroom of the Hilton and a preacher, so to forget into median today in our proceedings, I'd like to ask if you'd stand with me and go to the Lord repaired the blessed these proceedings today. Let the group in prayer. Heavenly father, we come to you this day seeking your blessings in this room and we ask, Lord that this reconciliation would begin today in a profound way each of our hearts as we learn from our past to move to our future Les Esis Day and board, we give you praise. In Jesus name we pray. Amen. You may be, see at this time, we would like for all of the descendants if you will, to please just stand with these descendants. Get up on stage. Thank you and good morning everyone one by one. I'm so happy to be here. As part of the reconciliation conference and they keep like a little schpiel about, oh, thank you so much. Thank you. They are what reconciliation means to them. And a lot of people don't know the Thomas Jefferson's wife. Martha is the half sister of Sally Hemet. Things you might not know about their ancestors. They had, they had the same father John Wells.

Speaker 6:          23:37          After about five people had spoken. Please welcome Charlie for the stage. Charlie Tani got up to talk morning. So

Speaker 7:          23:46          the first thing I like to do is tell you all how glad I am to be here. Real honor and privilege to be here. So let me start with Roger Burke. Tonya, what it was like to grow up as somebody to grow up as a tawny in terms of how we feel about him. It's a real, it's a mixed bag. It's a very mixed thing because on the one hand, as a tiny, you're proud of him. He was one of the longest serving chief justices, the Bible. He swore Lincoln and with, it's the same Bible that President Obama was sworn in on. However, that's not what he's known for. What he's known for is one thing he's done for the dred Scott decision. And just so we all want to get a handle on that. Let me read you a sentence that he wrote was his opinion at the time of the constitution that African-Americans, here's the quote for more than a century had been regarded as beans of an inferior ordering unfit to associate with white, the right race so far inferior. They had no rights, which the white man was bound to respect. So you might be proud of him but you can't talk that

Speaker 7:          25:22          you can talk about.

Speaker 7:          25:25          So, uh, I looked up reconciliation, I lift up this morning the process of reconciliation and there are three steps. The first step is apology. The second step is forgiveness. And the third step is a new trust. It grows out of that. But some, someone asks Kate about this issue, apology. And what Kate said was, my daughter said, well, she said, you know, autonomy, bringing an apology to a Scott is like bringing a bandaid to an amputation. It just, it is not enough. But he was like, you got to start somewhere. So let's let them, let's make a little history today on the tonics. So all the scotch

Speaker 3:          26:18          you have our apologies. Nope. [inaudible] [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          26:38          I spoke to Scott descendants afterwards. How was that? What did you of that? I'm still

Speaker 8:          26:44          emotion. Very much more emotional than I thought. That's great. Great granddaughter, Barbara Gregory. No one's ever apologize. Clinton made an apology some years ago, but coming from him didn't mean much. But here when tawny got emotional, when he was reading that letters, that was more heartfelt to me than anything else. The apology was okay, but, but his emotion really touched me. Barbara, that dred Scott descendant was like

Speaker 6:          27:17          when he choked up reading that I could feel that like, that felt like healing.

Speaker 8:          27:25          You're doing hello. Then I pull aside her brother and I ask you what you're thinking about. How did you respond to all of that? Dread, Scott Madison, the one with the eyes, everything was fine. It's just, ah, to be honest, the last part, pupil was Catholic. Uh, I didn't like it. I don't think somebody should have to apologize for something. They didn't do this. I just, I was very uncomfortable with that. That's the fact that they're here. Is apology enough apologizing for something your ancestor did? You're part of a gene pool. Usually you're judged by your works, not someone else's. Show me that you care. Don't tell me that you're sorry. Tell me that you're going to do better. That's the only

Speaker 1:          28:21          couple of final notes. When we talked to dread Scott Madison later, he was pretty clear that like Charlie Tawny is already doing a lot of good. He's helping the dred Scott Foundation to raise money. That's why he felt the trail. He didn't need to apologize. Also, when we started the story, there were statues of Roger Book Tawny in Annapolis and in Baltimore, both in front of courthouses.
