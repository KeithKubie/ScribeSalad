1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:03,580
Okay. Hey, what's going on it's Bill Burr.

2
00:00:03,581 --> 00:00:06,580
It's time for the Monday morning pod
no it isn't it's time for the Thursday

3
00:00:06,581 --> 00:00:10,140
afternoon. Just before Friday.
Monday morning podcast and ahhh

4
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:14,240
I'm just checking in on you.
Come. I can't fucking hear myself.

5
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:17,690
What am I going to plug this in right
here? Can I hear myself? There we go.

6
00:00:17,691 --> 00:00:22,640
Now I can hear myself. You
know Katie and myself, it's,

7
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:23,740
I go,
I was talking with about,

8
00:00:23,741 --> 00:00:27,590
with Dean del Ray last night
outside of the comedy store.

9
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:32,420
He was talking to me about how
you know,

10
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:36,230
you know in Quinn's singers
get old. They can't, you know,

11
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:41,470
they can't sing the way
they used to, right. Jesus,

12
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:43,150
this is going to be a long way.
You know,

13
00:00:43,151 --> 00:00:46,090
like I was watching Christopher
Cross last night, you know my wife,

14
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,830
I came home and it was cranking,
you know,

15
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:53,360
sailing, sailing away.
Go away to, well no,

16
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,640
the boat,
whatever the fuck he says,

17
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:58,680
cause that rat rack the whale.

18
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:03,080
Right manner do we might
listen to that shit.

19
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:06,850
[inaudible] such a lower walk.
Right.

20
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:12,880
Shit. So she was sitting
there talking. Ah,

21
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:15,610
fuck it. I'll just keep going
on this thing and I'll get
back to Dana, no matter.

22
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:19,510
She kept talking about, she goes, what
kind of like fucking music is this?

23
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:22,750
She's like, is this like
sort of uh, you know,

24
00:01:22,751 --> 00:01:25,360
she was saying it was sorta disc
away. I'm like, there really isn't.

25
00:01:25,361 --> 00:01:29,980
It's sort of post disco. What'd
you call that? Adult contemporary,

26
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:33,130
you know,
cuzzo raw nuts

27
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:38,560
because I ran man I like to wear
and then girls would go to low world

28
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:42,320
and there was have like the
fucking like really like, uh,

29
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:46,820
like the session musicians
they like so good. It's,

30
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:51,560
it just doesn't sound like
it's even alive. I know, it's
weird. I liked the music,

31
00:01:51,561 --> 00:01:54,950
but just some of the shit, like the
drummer was amazing on those fucking,

32
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:59,660
it's just too slick, you know? I Dunno
what the fuck it is. But anyways,

33
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:03,910
I was talking to Dean and
m we were talking about,

34
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:04,970
I hate when people like bitch,

35
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:08,960
when a singer gets old and then he can't
sing the way used to and it's just like,

36
00:02:08,961 --> 00:02:09,540
well,
yeah,

37
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:13,880
because back in the day they used to
sing like Robert blankets a ton of shit.

38
00:02:13,881 --> 00:02:14,361
It's like,
dude,

39
00:02:14,361 --> 00:02:18,770
you go sing the fucking immigrant song
every night for fucking a two year tour.

40
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:21,840
You, you're done. Right?
If you watched it.

41
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:23,420
But it might not saying he can't sing now,
but I mean,

42
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:24,980
what do you want from the guy?

43
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:29,660
He's out there drinking boozy smoking
cigarettes and he's fucking singing every

44
00:02:29,661 --> 00:02:34,610
goddamn night as opposed to these modern
day people who learn from the other

45
00:02:34,611 --> 00:02:35,660
guys the same way.

46
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:40,210
No drummer drives a Rolls Royce
into a swimming pool anymore. Right?

47
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:43,400
Did I almost say swimming
pool? Swimming Pool, right.

48
00:02:43,401 --> 00:02:47,730
Nobody drowns in their own vomit anymore.
It happens every once in awhile.

49
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:52,590
It fucking happens. But you know, you'll
learn. It's like when I came in, um,

50
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:55,450
when I came into this business,

51
00:02:55,451 --> 00:03:00,340
I saw a bunch of comics from the 80s
that didn't pay. And, and fucking

52
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:04,900
senate all up their nose and they had
their wages garnished and it was like they

53
00:03:04,901 --> 00:03:08,440
were on punishment for like 10 years.
So my,

54
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:10,840
my wave of comics,
you know,

55
00:03:10,841 --> 00:03:13,810
stayed away from the blow when
the booze and that type of shit.

56
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:15,220
And then what was funny,

57
00:03:15,221 --> 00:03:19,720
I got about 15 years into this shit and
I noticed that people started partying

58
00:03:19,721 --> 00:03:22,930
again. You know, just cause I,

59
00:03:22,931 --> 00:03:25,360
they probably looked at us like we were
sitting there like we were part of the

60
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:26,583
Osman family,
you know.

61
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:32,640
So then another thing that they say
is all wowed. You see so and so man,

62
00:03:32,641 --> 00:03:36,960
he got old. Oh Wow. She got old. And that
always bugs me. So say, well what do,

63
00:03:36,961 --> 00:03:41,130
what the fuck happened to you? You're
not losing your looks. They look at that.

64
00:03:41,131 --> 00:03:44,550
You say that enough. And now look
at all these fucking celebrities.

65
00:03:44,551 --> 00:03:45,480
So walking around,

66
00:03:45,481 --> 00:03:50,481
they get in their fucking lips
inflated to get net Goddamn Botox,

67
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:52,133
you know,

68
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:56,700
inject it in their face so they can be
like laminated had that nice shiny face

69
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:03,030
because nothing says youth, like
a shiny unmoving face. Right.

70
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:06,210
I don't know. I don't know how
the hell I got into that. Um,

71
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:10,350
I am going to go see a, a, I'm going
to go to a rock concert tomorrow night.

72
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:14,160
I'm going to UNMUTE, I don't even know
what the kids call them nowadays. Um,

73
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:18,150
I'm going to go see mute math tomorrow
night. Very excited about that. Um,

74
00:04:18,210 --> 00:04:22,080
it makes me feel like I'm somewhat not
an old guy to be going to this thing.

75
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,300
And a,
I'm so old,

76
00:04:24,301 --> 00:04:28,810
I can't even like classify what
their music is because uh, I had,

77
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:32,100
I was hanging with Dean last night,
a couple of other people,

78
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:34,170
couple other oldies like myself.

79
00:04:34,171 --> 00:04:37,920
We were all just coming to the
realization that rock music is, it's dead.

80
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:41,580
It's just, it's dead and there's
nothing we could do. And it's, you know,

81
00:04:41,581 --> 00:04:43,920
it's not coming back.
And if somebody tries to bring it back,

82
00:04:43,921 --> 00:04:47,910
there'll be considered retro. Right.
Am I out of my fucking mind? But it's,

83
00:04:47,911 --> 00:04:52,140
it's over. So last time you
saw somebody playing a guitar,

84
00:04:55,300 --> 00:05:00,120
I don't mean some Flamenco fucking shit
or doing your acoustic version of a,

85
00:05:00,121 --> 00:05:03,840
of a rap song. I don't fucking mean
that. I mean like just somebody, uh,

86
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:07,320
I dunno. I know there's a lot of people
scratching their heads going, well,

87
00:05:07,321 --> 00:05:10,770
what about all that death metal and all
that shit? I of course, I'm, I'm not,

88
00:05:10,771 --> 00:05:13,140
I'm not talking about that.
I'm not talking about any,

89
00:05:13,141 --> 00:05:16,350
anything I've just talking about.
Basically,

90
00:05:16,351 --> 00:05:21,351
I'm just an old man wondering where the
hair metal went 30 years after it died.

91
00:05:21,781 --> 00:05:26,100
36 years, maybe after it fucking died.
I'm just an old man rambling on a podcast.

92
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:30,420
Don't judge me. Huh? What about you?

93
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:33,860
What are you doing right now?
You sit in a traffic, right?

94
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:35,160
You're a little fucking car.

95
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:39,200
Drive over a puddle and the fucking
water comes up through the floorboards.

96
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,790
You're judging me. You
take, I haven't been there.

97
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:47,910
I'm fucking with you. Um, so last
night the show is Dean del Ray.

98
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:52,770
Just a sick fucking show.
I'm Dave Attell popped in who wants again,

99
00:05:52,771 --> 00:05:54,930
every time I see that guy
performed, stand up, it's just,

100
00:05:54,931 --> 00:05:59,810
I talked to Bart Nick as like, as
ever not going to be the best. Um,

101
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:02,780
and there's no way for me to say what
he says or I'll say burn his jokes.

102
00:06:02,781 --> 00:06:03,860
But he was just like,

103
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:08,360
he's one of those guys that he has me
dying laughing and half to half a set.

104
00:06:08,361 --> 00:06:12,530
I mean the dying laughing or I'm just
standing there just, just watching them,

105
00:06:12,531 --> 00:06:16,640
just shaking my head like, how the fuck
do you come up with that stuff? Um,

106
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:18,980
so what am, I guess what
I'm saying here is, um,

107
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:21,770
I like Christopher Cross and if you
have a chance, go see David. Tell,

108
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:26,060
I think that that was the purpose
of the first six minutes, right?

109
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:31,880
Is that what it is? I'm
not Jesus Christ. Oh Geez.

110
00:06:31,881 --> 00:06:36,350
I didn't tell you this man. Like,
um, I was traveling a lot and I was,

111
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:41,330
I was eating really poorly my last trip
there, uh, when I was in a Foxwoods,

112
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:42,920
right? Got The town early, visited,

113
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:46,550
visited a friend of mine who unfortunately
was in the hospital but is now out.

114
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:49,910
And um,
you know,

115
00:06:49,911 --> 00:06:54,911
so I was eating like shit that day and
then I fucking went up to fox woods and I

116
00:06:55,071 --> 00:06:56,480
ordered room service.

117
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:01,430
Then I lied to myself that I was going
to work out it on Sunday when I could've

118
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:01,971
worked out.

119
00:07:01,971 --> 00:07:05,210
I went to the Yukon game with Versie
Versie hooked me up with the ticket,

120
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:09,440
the gentleman that he is,
and I went there and I ate like shit.

121
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:12,350
So, uh, you know,

122
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:17,500
you combine eating like shit and then
getting on a plane for six hours and not

123
00:07:18,861 --> 00:07:21,200
drinking enough water and then
all of a sudden, you know,

124
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:24,110
the train's not coming out of the station.

125
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:34,220
So, you know, one day the train
doesn't come and it's like,

126
00:07:34,221 --> 00:07:36,620
God maybe will come the next day.
It doesn't come the next day.

127
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:39,200
And then the third day, uh, you
know, I'm like, what the fuck?

128
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:45,410
The train never comes again. Then
the, uh, the station dies. So,

129
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:49,820
uh, I started thinking I got to go
to fucking, you know, I gotta go to

130
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:56,660
Wolf Stall, right. All that shit.

131
00:07:56,661 --> 00:08:00,560
But then I just got all paranoid and
I was just like, you know something,

132
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:06,650
the thing about the corporations is
that they don't want to just get you,

133
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:10,310
they want to get you hooked and they
wanna head you keep coming back. So I got,

134
00:08:10,311 --> 00:08:12,830
I really started thinking about
it going like, well wait a minute.

135
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:17,840
If I go down and I take this stuff,
they'll probably be something in there,

136
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:23,120
in the little pill that tells my
digestive track to just stand down.

137
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:27,470
Yeah, we don't need you anymore. Don't
worry. We got it all right. Daddy's home.

138
00:08:27,471 --> 00:08:30,500
He's going to take care of everything
and then I'm going to become hooked on

139
00:08:30,501 --> 00:08:34,240
these fucking pills and then I'm going
to be one of those guys you see have any

140
00:08:34,241 --> 00:08:37,700
eat blueberries every morning for fucking
breakfast trying to turn his system

141
00:08:37,701 --> 00:08:41,270
around. Not realizing that he's fucking
himself far cause he went, you know,

142
00:08:41,271 --> 00:08:46,130
fucking himself over because he uh,
he's eating them fucking pills every day.

143
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:50,090
Right. It's going up getting
them fucking pills. Right. So

144
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:52,760
or freckles uses his brain.

145
00:08:52,761 --> 00:08:56,190
It's like there's no way that Julius
Caesar had never had a problem taking a

146
00:08:56,191 --> 00:08:59,610
shit. And I know that there was
no cvs pharmacy for him to go to.

147
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:01,710
So I just looked up natural,

148
00:09:01,711 --> 00:09:05,100
a natural cures and woo.

149
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:09,000
I found one that worked for all freckles.
I know this is gross,

150
00:09:09,001 --> 00:09:11,160
but it's a really important
thing. I went out, okay,

151
00:09:11,161 --> 00:09:15,150
it's a teaspoon of olive oil and
then you squeeze some lemon in it.

152
00:09:15,151 --> 00:09:18,690
You do it with the on an empty
stomach and you fucking, you know,

153
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:21,090
you do a shot of it in the morning.

154
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:24,930
And the only thing I can compare
it to as far as how well it works,

155
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:29,280
you guys ever watch gas monkey garage and
they get some old fucking car and they

156
00:09:29,281 --> 00:09:32,520
haven't turned over the engine and
well, all right, so what do they do?

157
00:09:32,521 --> 00:09:34,860
They take off the fucking,
the air filter housing,

158
00:09:34,861 --> 00:09:38,220
all that shit and they got that shit.
They sprayed into the carburetor,

159
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:41,910
they open the butterfly and
they have it wide open. They go,

160
00:09:41,911 --> 00:09:45,450
I give it a shot and the guy turns it over
here. The fuck thanks. Starts right up.

161
00:09:45,451 --> 00:09:46,860
That's basically what I did,

162
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:48,773
you know,

163
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:51,670
teaspoon of olive oil and some lemon.

164
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:56,410
You do a shot of that on an empty stomach.
I mean, you, you fucking aren't good.

165
00:09:56,530 --> 00:09:59,740
You're all good. You're on fucking
grease rails for the rest of the day.

166
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:07,300
I stand by it. I'm Bill
Barr and I fucking, uh,

167
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:12,100
I stand by this and I approve
of this message. Oh my God.

168
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:15,340
Just what nobody wanted.
Or at least I didn't want.

169
00:10:15,341 --> 00:10:20,341
It's down to Hillary and Donald
fucking Trump on fucking believable.

170
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,080
How to,
how did we get here?

171
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,040
Yeah.

172
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,050
You know what?
Cause me

173
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:35,340
unbelievable. No. Who Do fucking before.

174
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:39,350
Those are going to be my two choices.
I'm not doing it. You know what I mean?

175
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:43,550
Even though I didn't agree with everything
that Bernie Sanders wanted to do, uh,

176
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:49,450
I have to vote for a guy that went outside
the usual fucking places to get his

177
00:10:49,611 --> 00:10:53,360
money for his campaign. Just to fucking
encourage somebody else to do that.

178
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:56,240
And I really can't stand when people
say that that's a waste of a vote.

179
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:59,180
I don't think it is because I
think each time, each election,

180
00:10:59,210 --> 00:11:04,210
a guy like that gets a little bit farther
and I actually think it's great that,

181
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:08,720
uh,
that the Democrats and Republicans,

182
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:13,730
the best that they can come up with at
this point is Hillary Clinton and fucking

183
00:11:13,911 --> 00:11:17,750
Donald Trump. I mean, Jesus,
Holy Shit, this is fucking,

184
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:24,680
I don't really think there's a
lesser of two evil here. I just, it's

185
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:26,680
okay.

186
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:29,740
You have it sitting on the
last row of a plane, you know,

187
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:34,330
and they serve in the breakfast and it's
just like, all right, your choices today.

188
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:35,081
All right.

189
00:11:35,081 --> 00:11:40,060
Ham and cheese omelet or a bucket
is shit with Granola, right?

190
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:43,090
You're like, ah, fucking, and they
go and you're like, oh, fuck it.

191
00:11:43,091 --> 00:11:45,760
I'm going with the fucking ham and
cheese omelet. There's no choice here.

192
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,230
Let's see. That's not
even a choice, right.

193
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:52,360
We to have a limited selection
of the breakfasts is so we,

194
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:58,750
if when we get to you what she
want is not available at Amelia,

195
00:11:58,751 --> 00:12:02,770
like I'm fucked and you just sitting
there is every row women and she just see

196
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:07,210
the go. How do you see anything? Ham and
cheese alley and a ham and cheese omelet.

197
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:09,850
Okay. And if you say ham
and cheese Omelet, you know,

198
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:14,200
every once in awhile there's some martyr
that goes here. Take the bucket of Shit.

199
00:12:14,201 --> 00:12:18,580
Right. Um, and then by the
time it gets to you, you know,

200
00:12:18,581 --> 00:12:21,700
they're all gone. Even her to
say, I'm sorry sir. I'm sorry man.

201
00:12:21,701 --> 00:12:25,030
We don't have any more and
cheese I'm with. I understand.

202
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:26,110
I understand you're upset,

203
00:12:26,111 --> 00:12:29,620
but I don't choose how many ham and
cheese omelet throw on this flight.

204
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:32,530
Well,
I'm sorry you feel that way.

205
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:38,770
Well please go to American airlines.com/
org.net and I air your grievances there

206
00:12:38,771 --> 00:12:41,110
and our robot, we'll
get back to you. Right?

207
00:12:41,111 --> 00:12:44,620
So then they come up to you and of
course just, you just have to go.

208
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,480
You're all we have left
is the bucket of shit.

209
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:50,610
Would you like that with the Granola?

210
00:12:50,611 --> 00:12:54,600
The granola kind of takes the edge
off of the shit. Would that be okay?

211
00:12:54,601 --> 00:12:56,460
And you still have to
sit there and be like,

212
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:57,910
yeah,

213
00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:00,760
you just drag her through it even
though it's not her fault. You know,

214
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:04,160
you don't have what happened
to ham and cheese omelet.

215
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:06,170
Yeah.

216
00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:07,800
You don't have any of that.
Just started curiosity.

217
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:11,900
Do you ever started the back row and work
your way to the front just to kind of

218
00:13:11,901 --> 00:13:13,940
even it out? You know, you never do that.

219
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:18,350
How come you always start up front and
work your way back to that poor excuse

220
00:13:18,351 --> 00:13:21,470
for a of a kitchen? Why do you
do that? You know what I mean?

221
00:13:21,471 --> 00:13:24,140
So I thought that this
was all coach evidentaly.

222
00:13:24,141 --> 00:13:27,180
There isn't evidentaly
is the ham and cheese.

223
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:35,000
Sarah, why are you being hostile? Nine
11 safe. The terrorists save the chairs,

224
00:13:35,001 --> 00:13:39,390
fight the terrorists. Um, so anyways, uh,

225
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:43,220
how the fuck did I get into that?
What was I talking about?

226
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:49,320
I know I was talking about, Oh yeah,
the fucking, all the election is,

227
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:53,830
I got so lost in doing that. I didn't
remember when I was talking about, yeah,

228
00:13:53,831 --> 00:13:57,340
that's basically what we're left with
were basically sitting on in the last row,

229
00:13:57,341 --> 00:14:00,700
middle seat right next to the
bathroom on a DC nine, you know,

230
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:03,640
we can't even look out the window
and the engine is just blocking it.

231
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,950
And if you like me,
you heard of this story,

232
00:14:05,951 --> 00:14:09,310
the one time the engine failed
on the tarmac, thank God,

233
00:14:09,311 --> 00:14:12,760
but a piece of it flew through the
fuselage and into this woman's head and

234
00:14:12,761 --> 00:14:17,410
killed her. That's what I
always think about. But you
know what, I also, I also do,

235
00:14:17,411 --> 00:14:21,940
it's because, uh, you know,
I didn't really look it up.
Somebody just said it to me.

236
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:25,870
But last night I did look something up
because someone was trying to tell me

237
00:14:25,871 --> 00:14:30,871
that some comedian actually in American
comedian went to Dubai and had a little

238
00:14:32,621 --> 00:14:33,460
bit of coke in there,

239
00:14:33,461 --> 00:14:38,461
fucking suitcase that they forgot about
God caught with it and got automatic 10

240
00:14:39,461 --> 00:14:43,990
years. Um, and I'm just like, really?

241
00:14:43,991 --> 00:14:47,540
I go walk an American comic. And
they were like, yeah, yeah, dude,

242
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:51,350
American comic guys fucked.
Nobody had a name. No nothing.

243
00:14:51,351 --> 00:14:54,290
And I looked it up and for the life of me,
I can't find it.

244
00:14:55,670 --> 00:15:00,670
You know what I did find was that there
was this fucking half Iranian and half

245
00:15:01,431 --> 00:15:06,431
Swedish male model who got busted
with some sick amount of coke.

246
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:11,220
Somehow got a life sentence. They
didn't kill him, but they, um,

247
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:12,720
okay.

248
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:16,140
They did kind of reduce it down
to 10 years. So he's got 10 years.

249
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:18,920
So he made a rap song in jail,
like date.

250
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:22,440
Remember that Gay Shane who
was with j Lo and Puffy,

251
00:15:22,441 --> 00:15:25,890
I'm going way back to the 1990s when
people still watch music videos.

252
00:15:25,891 --> 00:15:30,300
Maybe it was the year 2000. Right. And uh,

253
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:35,130
what's his face used to
do a, the TV show. Oh God,

254
00:15:35,131 --> 00:15:38,340
what was it called?
Carson Daly used to do that show,

255
00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:43,560
the top 40 fucking videos, whatever
the fuck it was called. Um,

256
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:44,710
yeah,

257
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:47,700
during that time, right in members
shine did the fucking, he did,

258
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:52,000
he made a song over the
Rikers island phone. This guy
did the same fucking thing.

259
00:15:52,001 --> 00:15:56,080
And I got to admit like,
yeah, I dunno. I, I didn't,

260
00:15:56,120 --> 00:16:00,410
I didn't have sympathy for the guy, which
is weird. It's odd for me. I was just,

261
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,750
you know what it was cause
he was acting like Pete rose.

262
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:06,320
It was still all about him. He was like,
I didn't have any drugs in my system.

263
00:16:06,321 --> 00:16:09,140
I was blah blah. It's like, yeah, but
you were going to distribute the shit.

264
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:11,510
Your Cantonese didn't give a fuck
what happened. And those people,

265
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:14,210
you're trying to make some money.
You knew what the fine was.

266
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:16,730
You rolled the dice and you fucking lost

267
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:24,120
what kind of an asshole goes
anywhere in Asia with drugs,

268
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:27,810
you're Outta your fucking mind.
You're out of your fucking mind.

269
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:32,590
You're done. It's fucking over.
They have a zero tolerance.

270
00:16:32,591 --> 00:16:36,790
The only thing they do is make the drugs
and ship it over here for some fucking

271
00:16:36,791 --> 00:16:38,470
reason.
That's what I don't get.

272
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:44,660
If you get caught with drugs over there
yet, completely fucked. But God damn it,

273
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:48,630
they will make some in a minute.
Right. Well I guess that's Afghanistan.

274
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:52,160
Afghanistan is kind of the wild west,
right?

275
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:57,490
Do you think the fact that we've been at
war with them for almost a decade and a

276
00:16:57,490 --> 00:17:00,850
half, you'd think that I would fucking
know a little something about them.

277
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:06,070
I don't.
What do I know about those guys?

278
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:10,150
What was the number one band in
Afghanistan? You know what I mean?

279
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:15,580
I love to hear what the fuck they would
sing above. Man, that must be amazing.

280
00:17:16,690 --> 00:17:19,060
You know,
just rebelling against your parents.

281
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:22,890
Are Your parents want you to take

308
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,630
Somebody decided not to be a
teller telemarketer, right?

309
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:13,270
Or customer service guy leaves India

324
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:10,030
They always add the brass bed frame
and like a fucking grandfather clock.

325
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,220
It's like,

326
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:13,470

00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:04,840
Is it weird that that met made
me want to get some Indian food?

341
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:10,480
Is there anything better than garlic naan?
I Dunno.

342
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:15,510
Spent an lonely independence day on August
15th at a Sikh temple in Kabul or he

343
00:21:16,571 --> 00:21:21,490
had to, had taken refuge after
his Afghan visa expired. Well,

344
00:21:21,491 --> 00:21:23,230
how the fuck do you let that happen,

345
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:28,830
Mr Your Jam Hash who came to Afghanistan
on the promise of a job as a security

346
00:21:29,141 --> 00:21:34,141
guard in an American military base for
$800 every month had been swindled out of

347
00:21:36,221 --> 00:21:41,221
150,000 rupees or 2,300 bucks by
his employment agent in India.

348
00:21:42,411 --> 00:21:44,020
I thought, oh, I'll tell
you it's filthy. You know,

349
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:48,670
after paying the money and waiting
here for three months to 28 year old,

350
00:21:48,671 --> 00:21:52,750
found out that there was no job and
was left with just enough money for his

351
00:21:52,751 --> 00:21:55,510
phone in his cigarette.
Oh my God.

352
00:21:57,390 --> 00:21:59,130
Jesus fucking Christ.

353
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:05,700
Do People in like Asia just laugh at
American movies like our ideas of what

354
00:22:05,701 --> 00:22:10,650
trouble is? Can you imagine that?
Can you imagine? Somebody just said,

355
00:22:10,651 --> 00:22:14,160
hey, you want a job in Afghanistan?
And you go, yeah, I'll fucking do that.

356
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:17,460
I feel like there's a lot of American
military right now nodding their heads

357
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:20,590
like, yeah, we know what that's like.
Yeah. You get there to start with.

358
00:22:20,610 --> 00:22:24,330
They promised. Absolutely. Um,

359
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:26,461
you show up,

360
00:22:26,461 --> 00:22:28,920
you think you're going to be a hero and
then they tell you you got to buy your

361
00:22:28,921 --> 00:22:33,750
own uniform. Um, after paying the
money way, there was no fucking job.

362
00:22:33,751 --> 00:22:37,710
He's got enough money for phone and
cigarettes. Wow. Dude, that is just,

363
00:22:37,711 --> 00:22:39,420
that is next level evil.

364
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:44,190
The Indian embassy in Kabul
said that as of mid August,

365
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:48,840
70 distressed Indians.
That's the way they put it.

366
00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:49,703
Right.

367
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:55,220
Like posttraumatic Stress Syndrome instead
of the classic George Carlin Bit bit

368
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,770
shell shocked. Right. Who
was similarity? Similarity.

369
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,410
A banded and were sent back
to India. Oh, they sent back,

370
00:23:04,411 --> 00:23:09,240
I'll thank God last year they were 160.
Oh, so I see what this evil guy goes.

371
00:23:09,241 --> 00:23:12,060
He goes, well look, then we fucked them
over and then they get freaked out.

372
00:23:12,061 --> 00:23:15,450
But then they just go to the embassy
and then they pay for it, you know,

373
00:23:15,451 --> 00:23:19,230
fuck you on paying my taxes.
These guys will be all right.

374
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:21,850
And then they justify it right. Then they
go out and they by themselves, you know,

375
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:24,550
some shiny shoes and a car.
The Afghans,

376
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:29,740
Sikhs had given many of the Indians
refuge in their temple and Kaboodle, uh,

377
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:34,500
describe them as mostly poor folk who
had taken loans and sold off land to pay

378
00:23:34,501 --> 00:23:36,750
commission to fraudulent
employment agents.

379
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:40,620
They came with the hope of earning double
the money paid for low skilled jobs in

380
00:23:40,621 --> 00:23:42,260
India.
Do do you know when I landed,

381
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:45,890
landed in Dubai when I connected
there with no cocaine in my fucking

382
00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:51,110
suitcase? Do you know that?
Somebody told me that, you know,

383
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:55,550
there's basically the slave
labor camps that totaled,

384
00:23:55,551 --> 00:23:59,130
that built Dubai and uh,

385
00:23:59,810 --> 00:24:02,540
a lot of them were people from
India and they get promised, yeah,

386
00:24:02,541 --> 00:24:06,830
you come over here, you know, the, the,
the poorest of the poor. Come over here.

387
00:24:06,831 --> 00:24:08,960
You're going to make like
fucking nine zillion dollars.

388
00:24:08,961 --> 00:24:12,220
You're going to have a play station. And
then when you go back, you know, whatever,

389
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:15,170
you can bring your family over here
and all that, and they show up in,

390
00:24:15,171 --> 00:24:18,110
the first thing they do is they
confiscate their fucking passports.

391
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:22,550
And these people just be, they can't
leave and they just become slaves.

392
00:24:23,090 --> 00:24:27,260
And a, the number one cause of death
is like suicide. You know what I mean?

393
00:24:29,550 --> 00:24:33,850
Controversy at the Oscars.
I want,

394
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:38,070
I want to play a plumber.
American troubles.

395
00:24:42,330 --> 00:24:46,830
Um, fucking unbelievable.
Unfucking believable man. Well,

396
00:24:46,831 --> 00:24:49,950
I'm glad this person got back. Jesus
Christ. Like that's the type of shit,

397
00:24:49,951 --> 00:24:52,800
you know,
you remember that show arrested abroad.

398
00:24:53,370 --> 00:24:56,550
I remember back in the day on the,
uh,

399
00:24:57,150 --> 00:25:01,800
the LP and Anthony Program, the tragically
now gone, Opie and Anthony Program,

400
00:25:01,801 --> 00:25:03,960
one of the great radio
shows of all fucking time.

401
00:25:03,961 --> 00:25:07,740
I remember we were talking about that
and we were watching that are arrested

402
00:25:07,741 --> 00:25:08,310
abroad,

403
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:13,290
which just makes you never want to travel
outside of the United States again.

404
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:16,110
Or WHO's kidding? Who, you know,
they made it really fucking racial.

405
00:25:16,111 --> 00:25:19,530
It was just like, you're
white. Stay in the white zone.

406
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:23,790
You can go to England,
you can go to Canada,

407
00:25:24,090 --> 00:25:28,830
do not go south of San Diego
or you are on your own. Right.

408
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:33,300
But at the end of the day, as much as
these people were like fucking, you know,

409
00:25:33,301 --> 00:25:34,740
in jail, they always, you know,

410
00:25:34,770 --> 00:25:39,420
most of them did something
extremely fucking stupid where,

411
00:25:39,421 --> 00:25:40,410
you know,
the,

412
00:25:42,210 --> 00:25:45,660
they went out and bought platform shoes
and hollow them out and put a bunch of

413
00:25:45,661 --> 00:25:47,430
fucking,
you know,

414
00:25:47,431 --> 00:25:51,330
heroin in there and a couple of baggies
of coke up their ass. And it's just like,

415
00:25:51,410 --> 00:25:56,020
do you never saw midnight express?
If you can find that clip.

416
00:25:56,021 --> 00:25:59,910
I remember a long time ago
we kept riffing on that.

417
00:25:59,911 --> 00:26:02,770
That Irish guy would just go, you know,
when he got busted, he just, he can,

418
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:07,510
I just kept thinking, what have I done
and what he had done. You fucking,

419
00:26:07,511 --> 00:26:09,370
you fucked yourself over yet.
Dope.

420
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:11,093
Okay.

421
00:26:11,910 --> 00:26:15,600
I Dunno. I Dunno. How fucked up is
your life that like, that's your option

422
00:26:17,190 --> 00:26:20,710
you'd like, that sounds good.
Like, I mean, thank God I,

423
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:25,720
I just out of sheer dumb fucking luck
landed in the skin I have in the country.

424
00:26:27,721 --> 00:26:31,410
I mean, like I really got,
I got dealt the, you know,
a fucking and ace in a tent.

425
00:26:32,010 --> 00:26:34,530
I really did. I've totally
lucked out. You know what I mean?

426
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,100
If somebody ever came up
to me was just like, Hey,

427
00:26:36,130 --> 00:26:39,810
do you want to put some heroin in your
ass and try to make it across the border?

428
00:26:39,811 --> 00:26:44,250
It's just, it's, it's an emphatic,
definite in a final answer. Answer. No,

429
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:49,860
no, I'm good. I'm fucking
good. Don't need to do that.

430
00:26:49,890 --> 00:26:51,300
You know,
dude,

431
00:26:51,301 --> 00:26:55,410
I would go back to having a fucking
paper like I did in the third grade right

432
00:26:55,411 --> 00:26:59,460
through freshman year. To be honest with
you. I would actually do that job again,

433
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:03,660
you know, get a nice workout
in the morning. If I didn't
live in a fucking city,

434
00:27:03,661 --> 00:27:07,830
I would be a paper boy in a
fucking second is fucking great.

435
00:27:07,831 --> 00:27:11,070
You got up before everybody else.
It was really peaceful, quiet.

436
00:27:11,071 --> 00:27:14,160
Fucking birds were chirping. Yeah,
you had to deal with the weather,

437
00:27:14,161 --> 00:27:18,630
but that's what made you fucking man.
You know, you put on your pod show,

438
00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:22,710
right?
You put on your thick socks,

439
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:31,720
fucking nostrils freezer
together. Oh God, it was brutal.

440
00:27:31,730 --> 00:27:32,300
I never did.

441
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:35,770
Was nothing fucking better than when
back when they were actually four seasons

442
00:27:35,771 --> 00:27:40,771
on the east coast when the springtime
came and you got up in the morning and you

443
00:27:41,471 --> 00:27:42,880
didn't have to wear a jacket.

444
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:48,460
I cannot even describe to you how
fucking unbelievable that was.

445
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:50,740
Um,

446
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:54,310
and the same way the ominous feeling is
when it first started getting cold and

447
00:27:54,311 --> 00:27:57,580
you're like, oh fuck, here
comes another one. Um,

448
00:28:00,010 --> 00:28:02,590
I told you this story before and
I had this bike, this fucking,

449
00:28:02,650 --> 00:28:06,730
it was basically one of those
beach bikes with white wall tires.

450
00:28:06,731 --> 00:28:09,690
I was always a sucker for
fucking white walls. And I,

451
00:28:09,710 --> 00:28:11,790
I sort of pointed at the
bike making fun of it.

452
00:28:11,810 --> 00:28:15,730
My Dad loved it and he grew up
in the fifties, right? Oh yeah.

453
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:19,570
We got big tires, right? They had
those big fucking peewee Herman bikes.

454
00:28:19,571 --> 00:28:22,720
So I bought the bike and everybody was
laughing at me. All my friends had these,

455
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:26,560
you know, pre like fucking, uh,

456
00:28:27,190 --> 00:28:29,830
we're all those fucking BMX bikes.
It was pretty BMX. It was all,

457
00:28:29,831 --> 00:28:32,110
everything was all about
showing the Apollo three speed.

458
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:33,040
They only have these cool bikes.

459
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:37,240
And I had this giant Fucking Pre pee
wee Herman peewee Herman fucking bike.

460
00:28:37,870 --> 00:28:42,430
And I remember one time my older brother
took it and everyone was laughing and

461
00:28:42,431 --> 00:28:46,960
he wrote it down the driveway as fast
as he could in the tires was so big and

462
00:28:46,961 --> 00:28:49,120
thick that when he fucking locked him up,

463
00:28:49,630 --> 00:28:51,450
it actually made the sound
of a car and went like, yeah.

464
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:56,240
And then everybody thought that bike was
cool and then they, they would, you know,

465
00:28:56,270 --> 00:29:00,010
that's how I, I ended up fitting
in. People come all over,

466
00:29:00,090 --> 00:29:02,870
look at that stupid fucking bike and
all I had to do is lock 'em up once.

467
00:29:02,871 --> 00:29:05,300
And then they laughed and thought it was
called and it was all right. You know,

468
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:10,310
they look past my orange hair and my
freckles and that's the way I was 1976.

469
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:14,670
Um, anyways, yeah, I would do
that job in a fucking second.

470
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:17,220
Somewhere along the line
it became an adult's job.

471
00:29:17,610 --> 00:29:19,290
And it was a combination of when,
you know,

472
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:24,320
we finally addressed the fact that
there was a sexual predators out there.

473
00:29:24,601 --> 00:29:25,890
And then also the show's made,

474
00:29:25,891 --> 00:29:29,970
you feel like there was one
behind every fucking tree. MMM.

475
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:31,951
So anyways,
yeah.

476
00:29:31,951 --> 00:29:35,690
So that went out to fund any of the old
economy went to shit and it became an

477
00:29:35,691 --> 00:29:38,750
adult's job. But anyways, let me read
the, uh, let me read the fucking,

478
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:44,230
well the hell is, let me
do the live reads. Hey. Oh,

479
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:49,030
sailing away. Come on, come on. Come over
here and sing some Christopher Cross.

480
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:54,490
Oh, I'll do the Christopher Cross
part. You do the, you do the, uh,

481
00:29:54,770 --> 00:29:59,230

Michael McDonald do that
part right. All right, good.

482
00:29:59,231 --> 00:30:02,500
So Bri, Bri like to win. Shopped in,

483
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:07,640
it's something and now it's time for
the Michael McDonald fucking park.

484
00:30:10,330 --> 00:30:10,920
[inaudible]

485
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:15,450
no, it was bad at it. Does
it got such a long way to go?

486
00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:19,200
[inaudible]

487
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:22,620
the way that, wait, no. Then he goes,
uh, cause I got such a long way to go.

488
00:30:24,010 --> 00:30:26,600
Goes God,
it's such a long way to go.

489
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:34,293
[inaudible]

490
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:40,220
sorry, every once in a while and has
to just be for us. Yeah, sorry. Sorry.

491
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:43,540
Christopher Cross. Right. You know,
it's a big fan of him. Jimmy Fallon.

492
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:46,030
Jimmy Fallon sat him on,
he had him on his, uh,

493
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:49,090
when he took over for Colin and then he
has the him on the tonight show. Yeah.

494
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,510
Oh yeah.
I can't find a,

495
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:58,420
it was mostly annoyed. Much as you
hate that you do it all the time now.

496
00:30:58,510 --> 00:31:01,870
Yeah. That was the most annoying. Oh,

497
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:06,530
stop doing that. That was
a magic Johnson son, Ajay,

498
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:12,410
Ajay. And when he was talking about
him, I'm not saying he's a bad person,

499
00:31:12,411 --> 00:31:14,420
but like he's just like,
are you going up?

500
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:19,250
Because people just walk around and get
excited about sunglasses and shoes and

501
00:31:19,251 --> 00:31:21,640
shit. It's just like, that's
the big fucking thing.

502
00:31:21,650 --> 00:31:26,380
The material. Oh, Rad. The
materialism when people are
like, yeah, I was on his lay.

503
00:31:26,850 --> 00:31:27,340
Yeah.
Hello.

504
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:31,330
No, it's fun. It's like gross. Look, I
respect somebody that has style. Yeah.

505
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:34,130
Like when we watch it, come on, come
over there. The microphone. When you,

506
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:38,580
you take Chappelle show's block party,
right? Yes. Great fucking film. Yeah.

507
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:43,270
So we watched that and when a
Lauren Hill came out, right.

508
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:46,240
Oh my God. Yeah. Crazy.
Exactly. Great stuff.

509
00:31:46,270 --> 00:31:48,630
But she has sit around talking
about her shoes, everything.

510
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:53,020
Then she goes out and crushes it
and syncs as fucking suck. Okay.

511
00:31:53,170 --> 00:31:54,860
But for someone to just sit there,

512
00:31:54,930 --> 00:31:58,720
it just sit there and talking or
it'd be excited about blazers.

513
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:04,150
It fucking sock garters and
shit. It's just, I don't know.

514
00:32:04,330 --> 00:32:05,290
And then keep you like,

515
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:09,010
just like your days all we're going to go
out and go shop for five fucking hours.

516
00:32:09,550 --> 00:32:13,450
I don't understand B. What? I
said I love it. Hey by the weight,

517
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:18,310
you know something I'm going to fucking,
I'm going to handle the garage. Okay.

518
00:32:18,610 --> 00:32:21,260
Cause you know no, cause you
keep pooper when the whole thing,

519
00:32:21,310 --> 00:32:24,670
I understand what yeah. You know
something. If it was a common error,

520
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:27,010
if was a common area, you
would be excited. Yeah.

521
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:30,170
You think I'm not interested in
having a little gym here at the House.

522
00:32:30,171 --> 00:32:31,370
I think that's a great idea.

523
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:35,210
Who wouldn't want to have their own
little gym so they don't have to go out to

524
00:32:35,211 --> 00:32:36,044
work out.

525
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:39,890
Okay. Now did you guys hear what she just
said? How did she describe it? Twice.

526
00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:43,170
Little. Oh, you little
gym. Yeah. You guys. Yeah,

527
00:32:43,350 --> 00:32:47,070
you will sell events used to have that
bit whose joke is that was will sylvan

528
00:32:47,510 --> 00:32:52,100
insane. I see in you your little
Mercedes with your little Rolex

529
00:32:53,670 --> 00:32:57,320
taking me down. I'm not taking you
down. I'm just telling you, you know,

530
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:57,831
you're calm.

531
00:32:57,831 --> 00:33:01,370
Tone is like when a pilot just goes
through turbulence and even he's scared,

532
00:33:01,550 --> 00:33:03,710
but he doesn't want to scare you.
So he just speaks in that

533
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:07,120
I really hate when you reference yourself.

534
00:33:07,210 --> 00:33:11,440
I really hate when you reference your own.
What am I supposed to do? I don't know.

535
00:33:11,570 --> 00:33:15,760
It's who I am. I don't know.
But to reference your own
self is like so annoying.

536
00:33:15,761 --> 00:33:16,660
And so

537
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:20,810
because I'm gonna Redo the garage.
I don't give a fuck.

538
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:27,140
Buh Buh, Buh, Buh better. Cause
you're bald. Fucking help me out.

539
00:33:27,530 --> 00:33:29,040
No, you bought, pumped me up.

540
00:33:30,970 --> 00:33:35,290
All right, let's get into the, uh, the
advertising for this week. First of all,

541
00:33:35,291 --> 00:33:37,750
if you think you're going to be this,
I'm building a man's Jim.

542
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:42,070
This is going to be out there with like,
like fucking uh, Ooh. You had a baby girl.

543
00:33:42,071 --> 00:33:46,990
Fucking risk weights. Your pink
fucking getting shaped girl waits.

544
00:33:46,991 --> 00:33:48,080
It's not going to be that.
Yeah,

545
00:33:48,210 --> 00:33:52,060
it's like itching to be the band.
That's crazy.

546
00:33:52,061 --> 00:33:53,400
You gave her her allergy pills.

547
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:56,110
No, I actually forgot to. Did you really?

548
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:59,140
Can you come over to the mic so people
don't have to lean forward into their

549
00:33:59,141 --> 00:34:00,640
dashboard?
Is it driving here?

550
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:04,050
People can hear it. You're the only
one who screams into the microphone.

551
00:34:04,051 --> 00:34:07,590
Like completely defeating the
purpose of why a microphone exists.

552
00:34:08,150 --> 00:34:12,770
I'm the only one who was screaming into
a microphone. No, but all right then

553
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:17,090
anyway. Oh yeah. So what I found,

554
00:34:17,091 --> 00:34:21,620
what I want here is a rogue fitness.

555
00:34:22,210 --> 00:34:22,330
Gee,

556
00:34:22,330 --> 00:34:26,060
it would be nice if rogue fitness would
trade some equipments if for some free

557
00:34:26,061 --> 00:34:27,020
advertising.

558
00:34:28,050 --> 00:34:32,220
The WHO said that?
Our ml three w fold back while Mont Rack.

559
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:33,413
Say it again.

560
00:34:33,510 --> 00:34:38,510
The rogue r m l three w fold back
wall mount rack made in the USA.

561
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:42,830
This is what's great.
It can fold back into the wall.

562
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:46,820
So if you have a small garage like me
that's built for a fucking, you know,

563
00:34:46,850 --> 00:34:49,910
1928 model t Ford.
If there was one,

564
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:54,080
some gear heads we urge suitable
to continue in 1927. I don't care.

565
00:34:54,081 --> 00:34:59,060
I don't make them. Um, what's great is
it has a pull up bar on it. It's got,

566
00:34:59,090 --> 00:35:02,630
you can, you can move the
thing up and you can do squats.

567
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:06,590
Nobody does their legs
from my generation's all
about the upper body weight

568
00:35:06,591 --> 00:35:10,900
doing today. Chairs to buy the, I can
try. Yeah, we got to do your legs, dude.

569
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:12,320
I walk around all the time.

570
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:14,040
Why?
Why?

571
00:35:14,041 --> 00:35:18,400
Why do certain guys have like these
little chicken legs and these huge upper

572
00:35:18,401 --> 00:35:22,330
bodies? What is that about? Is that
like that's a deliberate style,

573
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:23,650
like they're doing that on purpose?

574
00:35:23,810 --> 00:35:24,190
No.

575
00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:28,520
What it is is when you walk up to the
sink and you flex in the mirror you have

576
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:30,770
from your waist down is below the vanity.

577
00:35:31,050 --> 00:35:35,360
So you can't see out of
proportion you are. But yeah,
and plus legs. It's not sexy.

578
00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:38,660
It's not fun. It's hard.
It's work every, any.

579
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:41,910
Do you go to any fucking gym in the world?
If you want to go bench press,

580
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:43,440
if there's two people in there,

581
00:35:43,590 --> 00:35:46,200
there's only gonna be two benches and
they're both going to be occupied.

582
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:49,710
That's all guys do. Every guy,
there's a zillion exercises,

583
00:35:49,711 --> 00:35:52,800
but every guy goes over the bench press.
What are you putting up? A little bullet.

584
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:56,430
25. I'll be full. Good Times,
right? But all that other shit.

585
00:35:56,610 --> 00:35:58,890
There's very few people that actually,

586
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:04,040
when you go to the gym have like a
proportion by the ladies are all about the

587
00:36:04,141 --> 00:36:07,530
squats and everything because that's your,
that's your problem areas.

588
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:11,400
It's the biggest part of
your body as the legs. Yeah.

589
00:36:11,401 --> 00:36:13,740
And actually if you build up your thighs,
you build that.

590
00:36:13,750 --> 00:36:16,410
That's the biggest muscle in
allegedly burns enough fat.

591
00:36:16,650 --> 00:36:20,160
And I could get rid of my see
belly here. See belly, good belly.

592
00:36:20,310 --> 00:36:21,270
I was trying to be a gentleman.

593
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:24,313
Nothing.

594
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:31,300
Oh. Freckled cod belly shots.
You're caught nothing. Yeah,

595
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:36,110
you're dumb. I'm not dumb. There's a
lot of the CB this name. Huh? A pooch.

596
00:36:36,170 --> 00:36:37,760
There's a lot of things.
I've got a baby bump.

597
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:40,380
I got it. I got it. Um,

598
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:44,520
there's a lot of too much
Gaba go. Oh yeah. Okay.

599
00:36:45,050 --> 00:36:47,430
There's a lot of good
reviews for this thing. Yeah.

600
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:51,030
It got four stars or is that five?
Five stars. Five stars. Yeah.

601
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:54,200
Have you researched it? Um,
I'm going to handle all of it.

602
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:58,520
You tapped out this morning.
All right, fine. Fine, fine.

603
00:36:58,670 --> 00:37:02,180
I'll let you handle it. You let me handle
it and I'll let you know how it is.

604
00:37:02,390 --> 00:37:05,090
And when I walk around and I'm
shredded and I'm proportioned,

605
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:08,480
you're going to be like, you know
what? God Damn it. I was wrong.

606
00:37:08,650 --> 00:37:10,830
Are you going to put it? And
I'll say I forgive you. Oh,

607
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:14,420
are you going to put up a mirror somewhere
so you can watch yourself while you

608
00:37:14,421 --> 00:37:18,620
shred? See what? See what she's doing? You
a little Jimmy. You can put a mirror up.

609
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:23,080
I'll be right back. You're scared. You're
scared of what I'm going to become. Yeah.

610
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:30,200
All right. Let me read the
fucking advertising so I can
get on with the day here.

611
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:35,160
All right. Track are
smart cars, smart phones,

612
00:37:35,161 --> 00:37:36,210
smart homes.

613

Technol technology has
made everything smart.

614
00:37:41,430 --> 00:37:45,390
Balloons in your stuff's still make SMAD.
People feel really stupid.

615
00:37:45,990 --> 00:37:49,020
Tracker making,
losing things.

616
00:37:49,021 --> 00:37:54,021
A thing of the past track is a coin
size device that locates misplaced keys,

617
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:58,650

God, I fucking need one of these.

619

621

622
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:18,660
Lose your phone.
No problem.

623
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:24,680
Cliffy press the button on tracker

Here's some more music from
Andrew Feminists and he's the one,

663
00:40:53,270 --> 00:40:56,630
he's the reason why I know who about
mute math and I'm very excited.

664
00:40:56,840 --> 00:41:01,790

I'll see you guys in the crowd. Huh?

665
00:41:02,750 --> 00:41:04,730
Did I miss most of the podcasts?
Yeah,

666
00:41:04,731 --> 00:41:07,250
unless you want to do a little
bonus time here. How about you cleo?

667
00:41:07,251 --> 00:41:11,590
You want to do some bonus time?
Glio Nate kiss.

668
00:41:11,750 --> 00:41:16,490
Hello Buddy. Get down.
Go lay down. Clean up.

669
00:41:16,491 --> 00:41:19,820
Go on. Yes. Step right on it. Yep.
Step right on it. There you go.

670
00:41:20,150 --> 00:41:21,350
Get over on your bed.

671
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:26,120
Get over there. Go on. Go
on. Lay Down about the,

672
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:28,473
Huh?

673
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:32,940
I talked about the Oscars the last
time. What did you talk about? I,

674
00:41:33,450 --> 00:41:33,980
I was talking to how

675
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:36,890
white people fucking
crushed it again this year.

676
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:42,170
Oh, I mean, I don't really have, are
you allowed to be proud as a white male,

677
00:41:42,230 --> 00:41:46,610
heterosexual and your faces other people?
Sure.

678
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:50,330
Uh, I don't, I actually don't have
anything else to contribute to stuff.

679
00:41:51,170 --> 00:41:55,400
You don't have anything else
to contribute? I wrapped
up the podcast dead. Sorry.

680
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:58,970
I know I got all excited and
I realized I got nothing. No,

681
00:41:58,971 --> 00:42:01,520
I thought I talked Chris Rock's
monologue was fucking tremendous.

682
00:42:01,550 --> 00:42:04,720
I thought he had dressed in, I thought
it was, we was well balanced in the end.

683
00:42:04,721 --> 00:42:07,040
He's like, yeah, we're just looking
for an opportunity. He can't,

684
00:42:07,041 --> 00:42:10,310
he can't get mad at that.
You know,

685
00:42:10,730 --> 00:42:14,810
it is funny watching adults wanting to
win a trophy belt. That is funny to me.

686
00:42:17,270 --> 00:42:20,830
Cry. Um, anyway,

687
00:42:21,050 --> 00:42:24,410
to be nominated for an Oscar that wouldn't
you? What's that? What have you liked?

688
00:42:24,411 --> 00:42:25,910
Just crush it in a movie.

689
00:42:25,911 --> 00:42:29,750
And there was talk of like at the studio
and stuff of you being nominated and

690
00:42:29,751 --> 00:42:33,110
they wanted you to do a campaign and all
that kind of stuff that I would like to

691
00:42:33,111 --> 00:42:36,830
be the guy that everybody says
should've got nominated and then didn't.

692
00:42:36,950 --> 00:42:38,720
So then everybody feels bad for you,

693
00:42:38,721 --> 00:42:42,370
but you don't have to campaign or go to
the shelf. That's the sweet spot in here.

694
00:42:42,390 --> 00:42:44,060
Okay, that makes sense. Yeah.

695
00:42:44,061 --> 00:42:46,520
You don't wanna be the guy that gets
fucking nominated and then you've got to

696
00:42:46,521 --> 00:42:49,640
sit there with the camera on your
face as the guy with the fucking good.

697
00:42:49,990 --> 00:42:54,050
What's that? What's that fucking kettle?
Kettle drum. Right. Like the Timpani.

698
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:57,290
It's just like, they're not going
to give it to me. Look at me.

699
00:42:57,291 --> 00:42:58,730
I'm a balding fractal. Fuck. Right.

700
00:42:58,731 --> 00:43:00,710
And then they give it to
the guy with the square jar.

701
00:43:01,550 --> 00:43:04,500
Then he goes up there and
I sit there going, oh gosh,

702
00:43:04,530 --> 00:43:08,830
such a low word of goals.
We're killing this. Um,

703
00:43:09,980 --> 00:43:14,210
was funny fucking 12 minutes ago,
the first 58 times we did it. Yeah.

704
00:43:14,211 --> 00:43:16,820
That's what I would like to be.
All right.

705
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:21,650
You want to be the guy that people said
get fucked over because then people feel

706
00:43:21,651 --> 00:43:25,010
like you're still there.
You like the underground band?

707
00:43:26,330 --> 00:43:28,970
Yeah. Yeah. Keep pulling
your eyebrows up. Like,

708
00:43:28,971 --> 00:43:30,740
I haven't figured out
this fucking business.

709
00:43:30,741 --> 00:43:33,800
I have all these dudes who get nominated.

710
00:43:33,801 --> 00:43:37,070
The next thing you know they're fucking
doing crest commercials and they sit in

711
00:43:37,071 --> 00:43:40,790
court side on the fucking game and then
people get annoyed because they start

712
00:43:40,791 --> 00:43:43,700
seeing and when they shouldn't be
seeing them and then you're just fucking

713
00:43:43,701 --> 00:43:46,130
everywhere and it's just like,
there's a hole in the ozone layer.

714
00:43:46,340 --> 00:43:50,030
Hey Guy from this fucking movie.
What do you think about who I fit?

715
00:43:50,031 --> 00:43:51,530
The constituents and you.
It's like,

716
00:43:51,531 --> 00:43:56,000
why am I listening to this guy from the
reboot of Brady bunch talking about what

717
00:43:56,001 --> 00:43:59,060
we should do in Afghanistan? And then
you jumped the shark and you're done.

718
00:43:59,090 --> 00:44:01,850
You want to be the guy that people
are going like, he got fucked man,

719
00:44:02,060 --> 00:44:04,910
that movie so much fucking better,
but blah, blah blah, blah, blah. Yeah,

720
00:44:04,911 --> 00:44:07,850
you wanna you wanna beat chest
underneath it so people know who you are.

721
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,460
So they still show up to see
your Dick and shit jokes,

722
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:14,450
but you're not overly exposed.
I like your philosophy,

723
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:22,120
not the, I, there's nothing else
that I agree with. You what I,

724
00:44:22,121 --> 00:44:24,100
I seriously do.
I'm not joking.

725
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:27,280
You've probably said that like three
times in the 12 years that I've known.

726
00:44:27,281 --> 00:44:31,000
You said what? I agree
with you. I agree with two.

727
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:36,440
I have nothing to add. Yeah,
but I don't like it. Okay.

728
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:39,900
This is like when Vince Vaughn was on
Jimmy Fallon and knew Jimmy was trying to

729
00:44:39,901 --> 00:44:42,160
get in his head when they were
going to play a, what's in the box?

730
00:44:42,350 --> 00:44:46,230
The best fucking bets they call
what's in the box? What's in the bar?

731
00:44:47,260 --> 00:44:51,490
I got to go a lie. I don't
know the liars box. Yeah,

732
00:44:52,550 --> 00:44:57,480
dude, that was a clinic. That was a clinic
that Vince Vaughn put on there. Alright,

733
00:44:57,520 --> 00:45:01,580
I'm a, I'm out of time here, right?
Enjoy the rest of the podcasts.

734
00:45:01,581 --> 00:45:05,490
I'll talk to you on Monday.
[inaudible]

735
00:45:36,060 --> 00:45:36,893
[inaudible]

736
00:45:42,220 --> 00:45:46,850
all right, here's the sexuality
situation. Everybody. Um, hey bill,

737
00:45:46,851 --> 00:45:49,580
I need your advice on
something. Uh, this is a nut.

738
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:52,430
This is not about a breakup
dating are gold diggers,

739
00:45:52,431 --> 00:45:53,990
but I think your advice could help me,

740
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:57,440
could help me out on an
extremely awkward position.

741
00:45:57,980 --> 00:46:01,070
I'm 19 and I'm home from college for this.
I'm a,

742
00:46:01,940 --> 00:46:04,520
I've been home for about a month
and I live in North Carolina,

743
00:46:04,521 --> 00:46:06,470
but go to college in Arizona.
Dude,

744
00:46:06,471 --> 00:46:09,950
good move Arizona with all
those fucking whores out there.

745
00:46:10,410 --> 00:46:14,420
Come into class and like bikini tops
and you're out there with the acute and

746
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:19,820
cute southern drawl. How much asks
are you getting? Well, let's find out.

747
00:46:19,821 --> 00:46:22,220
Shall We? Okay. While
I was away at college,

748
00:46:22,250 --> 00:46:27,140
I have opened up to new ideas such
as politics, politics, religion,

749
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:32,390
and about my sexuality and my bias at,
and I am bisexual.

750
00:46:33,050 --> 00:46:34,100
At the beginning of summer,

751
00:46:34,101 --> 00:46:36,920
I started hanging out with my
old friends from high school,

752
00:46:37,250 --> 00:46:41,480
one of which was gays. We
had messed around in high
school, but nothing serious.

753
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:44,570
What does that mean?
You flicked his balls a little bit.

754
00:46:49,230 --> 00:46:52,860
Sorry. The fucking joke is there. I'm
going to do it. All right. Come on.

755
00:46:52,890 --> 00:46:56,400
Take it like a man like everybody else.
Okay. Everybody gets trashed on this.

756
00:46:57,030 --> 00:46:57,660
Here we go.

757
00:46:57,660 --> 00:47:00,810
So this summer he and I were hanging
out at my house and nobody was home.

758
00:47:00,811 --> 00:47:04,560
We started and we started to drinking.
Oh Gee. She's playing some music.

759
00:47:04,860 --> 00:47:09,690
Why Mca?
And he started to smoke some weed man.

760
00:47:10,230 --> 00:47:11,880
Then after about two hours,

761
00:47:12,180 --> 00:47:16,230
we decided to do the dirty Jesus Christ.

762
00:47:18,100 --> 00:47:21,790
Okay. Here we go. Slugging away through
here. Halfway through US getting it on.

763
00:47:21,791 --> 00:47:26,260
My mom walks into the room
and catches us in the act.

764
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:32,110
Wow. Now talk about the needle
going off the fucking record.

765
00:47:32,950 --> 00:47:37,750
She started yelling at me, swatting
me with the mail she had just gotten,

766
00:47:37,820 --> 00:47:41,920
I'm surprised she didn't turn the hose on.
You kick my friend out of the house.

767
00:47:42,340 --> 00:47:46,870
Then banned him from ever coming over
again and started screaming about the

768
00:47:46,871 --> 00:47:50,740
Bible and a bunch of religious shit.
By the way,

769
00:47:50,741 --> 00:47:52,540
this all happened when I was in a,

770
00:47:53,170 --> 00:47:56,920
in a panic trying to get some
clothes. Oh my God, Dude.

771
00:47:57,910 --> 00:47:59,200
What a way to come out.

772
00:48:01,620 --> 00:48:05,730
Only thing was missing was a giant
neon. I'm gay. Sign hanging over your,

773
00:48:07,210 --> 00:48:11,260
wow. That's a fucking
situation there, Huh.

774
00:48:11,650 --> 00:48:12,341
Ever since then,

775
00:48:12,341 --> 00:48:16,660
my mom and dad had been forcing me to
go to a few religious nutjobs that is

776
00:48:17,050 --> 00:48:21,850
supposed to convert me from bisexual
to heterosexual. That's hilarious.

777
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:25,080
You know like you going to convert
a truck from two wheel drive,

778
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:27,070
the four wheel drive,
like it's that fucking easy.

779
00:48:27,790 --> 00:48:30,070
This is a huge pain in
the ass because one,

780
00:48:30,071 --> 00:48:33,310
there are churches on every
corner in North Carolina and two,

781
00:48:33,311 --> 00:48:37,060
I don't want to change. So you
shouldn't, dude, you can't.

782
00:48:37,061 --> 00:48:40,330
You are who you fucking are and they're
going to have to accept it. Also,

783
00:48:40,331 --> 00:48:43,990
my parents had been treating me
differently now and it's really weird and

784
00:48:43,991 --> 00:48:45,700
awkward every time we talk.

785
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:49,630
So I guess my question is how do I
deal with this through this is might be

786
00:48:49,631 --> 00:48:53,440
outside the mother realm of my
lack of extra expertise here.

787
00:48:53,441 --> 00:48:56,920
Do I tell them that I don't want to go
to some religious fat fuck who was a

788
00:48:56,921 --> 00:49:01,600
Jesus Freak and whose stomach
is as long as his vowels?

789
00:49:02,900 --> 00:49:04,210
Oh,
you got that southern draw.

790
00:49:05,590 --> 00:49:10,220
You can't be suck in data.
Um,

791
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:13,390
or should I just pretend to be
straight until the end of summer,

792
00:49:13,391 --> 00:49:17,560
then go back to living the life
I want to live at college. Also.

793
00:49:17,561 --> 00:49:21,820
How do I keep saying with people telling
me that I am living my life wrong and

794
00:49:21,821 --> 00:49:25,420
that God is judging me? I hope
that wasn't too sad, dude.

795
00:49:25,421 --> 00:49:29,740
It's a fucking epic story. Thank you for
sharing. Sharon it here. Um, all right.

796
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:31,930
This is a deal to you.
You need new friends.

797
00:49:32,710 --> 00:49:35,890
You need to keep the friends that accept
you for who you are and the ones who

798
00:49:35,891 --> 00:49:38,740
aren't. You just got to phase
them out. Your parents were,

799
00:49:38,830 --> 00:49:41,920
your parents will come around,
you know,

800
00:49:42,930 --> 00:49:47,620
they get to come around cause
you're, you're their son.
All right? Stereotypically,

801
00:49:47,621 --> 00:49:51,280
probably your mom before
your dad or whatever, but I
don't know, maybe they will.

802
00:49:51,580 --> 00:49:56,140
Maybe they won't. But what the
fuck are you going to do? You know,

803
00:49:56,170 --> 00:49:59,590
you are who you are. You've got to
go be who you're going to be. And uh,

804
00:50:02,860 --> 00:50:06,580
as far as the tough it out for the
summer, that that's up, that's up to you.

805
00:50:07,660 --> 00:50:09,580
That's up to you. If you're
going to keep going back. I mean,

806
00:50:09,581 --> 00:50:12,960
if I was going to keep going
back to some shit that I wanted,

807
00:50:12,970 --> 00:50:15,010
didn't want to go to,
I would just,

808
00:50:18,070 --> 00:50:19,360
I would have fun with it.

809
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:25,500
I would just act like a fucking moron
and I would keep acting like I was almost

810
00:50:25,631 --> 00:50:27,980
cured. And then at the last second
be like, but don't you think

811
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:30,320
John Travolta's cute?
Oh, no, no. Sorry. Sorry.

812
00:50:30,490 --> 00:50:33,530
I'm just fuck with the guy who just have
a good time. If he can't get out of it,

813
00:50:34,190 --> 00:50:36,560
if you don't want to, you
know, fight, you know,

814
00:50:36,590 --> 00:50:40,130
if you don't want to be like Hitler and
try and fight on three fronts and ended

815
00:50:40,131 --> 00:50:43,970
up in a fucking bunker, uh,
maybe just start with the,

816
00:50:43,971 --> 00:50:48,950
get some new fucking friends. Uh,
that's it, dude. That's brutal, man.

817
00:50:49,910 --> 00:50:52,100
That's brutal. But, uh,
you'll get through it.

818
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:56,530
You'll get through it and you'll find some
fucking people, you know? I don't know.

819
00:50:56,610 --> 00:50:59,960
It's weird. In a weird way. Everybody
does that beyond that shit. You know,

820
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:02,750
as a comedian, I never fit in
anywhere. Everywhere I went,

821
00:51:02,751 --> 00:51:06,920
like when I fucking had jobs and they
would be sitting there and I had my little

822
00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:10,140
Michael J. Fox fucking suit
and tie on like thinking that,

823
00:51:10,141 --> 00:51:11,780
that this is what I was going to do.

824
00:51:12,050 --> 00:51:15,680
And everybody was going in for some
fucking meeting. I'd never gave a fuck.

825
00:51:15,681 --> 00:51:17,000
And I never,
I just felt,

826
00:51:17,001 --> 00:51:20,360
always felt like an outsider until
the day I walked into a comedy club.

827
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:24,710
And I basically found people who were
the same kind of weird that I was.

828
00:51:24,950 --> 00:51:26,330
So they didn't seem weird to me.

829
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:29,600
A bit of middle of the Comedians
were all out of our fucking minds.

830
00:51:29,601 --> 00:51:32,060
So that's what you have
to do in a gay way.

831
00:51:32,090 --> 00:51:36,920
You just got to go find some heterosexuals
who were accepting of you and go get

832
00:51:36,921 --> 00:51:39,500
some gay friends and uh,
you know,

833
00:51:39,990 --> 00:51:42,860
you're going to have a great life and
you're going to have abs until you're 60,

834
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:44,900
evidently.
Cause that's how it works with gay people.

835
00:51:47,630 --> 00:51:48,463
Fuck up

836
00:51:49,460 --> 00:51:51,400
video. You are, and that's it. All right,

837
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:52,353
there you go.

838
00:52:21,820 --> 00:52:22,653
[inaudible] [inaudible]

839
00:52:34,570 --> 00:52:35,403
MMM.

840
00:52:50,030 --> 00:52:50,590
[inaudible]

841
00:52:50,590 --> 00:52:53,820
all right, sisters a
through c. Here we go.

842
00:52:55,770 --> 00:53:00,060
Tired of giving advice to guys with
psycho suicidal girlfriends or people with

843
00:53:00,061 --> 00:53:03,740
STDs? Well, I got something a
bit lighter, a few here. Uh,

844
00:53:03,810 --> 00:53:07,170
kind of like the cores lite version
of your typical advice. Thank you.

845
00:53:07,650 --> 00:53:10,800
And is perfect for the middle of the
summer. Like kick my feedback on this one.

846
00:53:11,310 --> 00:53:16,310
So I know this lady who
I've been friends with uh,

847
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:21,780
for awhile now and banged one time,
she's the oldest of three sisters,

848
00:53:21,781 --> 00:53:26,781
so we all call her sister a about two
years I made out with sister be in a club,

849
00:53:28,350 --> 00:53:32,910
not my initiative. Um, and ended up
having sex with her the same night.

850
00:53:33,090 --> 00:53:36,150
Jesus Christ. Dude, I
went out with her. Do,

851
00:53:36,151 --> 00:53:39,240
do they have like that thing on the back
of their SUV where they have the stick

852
00:53:39,241 --> 00:53:42,780
figures of the entire family and
you just slowly keep axing them out

853
00:53:45,450 --> 00:53:45,900
in the family.

854
00:53:45,900 --> 00:53:49,590
Doesn't understand if somebody's trying
to kill my daughters now I'm just trying

855
00:53:49,591 --> 00:53:53,940
to fuck all of them, sir. Well,
that's a relief. All right.

856
00:53:54,630 --> 00:53:58,980
Um, anyways, I went out
with her for awhile. Oh,

857
00:53:58,981 --> 00:54:00,030
this is sister B.

858
00:54:00,390 --> 00:54:03,780
And it was surprisingly not awkward
when we were hanging out all together,

859
00:54:03,781 --> 00:54:08,220
even though everyone knew the situation.
Jesus Christ,

860
00:54:08,221 --> 00:54:11,700
what southern state are you in, sir? Um,

861
00:54:11,730 --> 00:54:14,140
I'll go fuck yourself people
down south. That was funny. No,

862
00:54:14,150 --> 00:54:16,950
I'm some months later sister
be left me for one of her,

863
00:54:17,070 --> 00:54:21,920
one of my friends and got
over it quickly enough bone.

864
00:54:21,930 --> 00:54:23,340
You got over it quickly enough.

865
00:54:24,090 --> 00:54:28,200
And nowadays I'm still in contact with
sister a and B since I'm not the kind of

866
00:54:28,201 --> 00:54:30,480
guy that holds a grudge for that
kind of stuff. Well there you go.

867
00:54:31,860 --> 00:54:32,431
It's very immature,

868
00:54:32,431 --> 00:54:34,470
which means you really didn't give
a fuck about either one of them.

869
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:36,650
So why are you going to be all upset?
You know,

870
00:54:36,690 --> 00:54:39,780
like you own their pussy once you fucking,
I hate when, I hate when guys do that.

871
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:42,070
Anyways,
recently senses to see,

872
00:54:42,071 --> 00:54:45,300
started talking to me more
frequently after talking for a bit.

873
00:54:45,540 --> 00:54:50,540
She said she could pose for me since
I'm a painter and she's a model and a 10

874
00:54:50,730 --> 00:54:54,600
all the fucking way I might
add, oh, you fucking creep.

875
00:54:55,260 --> 00:54:58,230
You fucking creep.
You fucking creep.

876
00:55:00,570 --> 00:55:02,100
So she was attend the whole time.

877
00:55:02,101 --> 00:55:06,150
So basically you're in a holding pattern
banging her oldest sisters waiting

878
00:55:06,151 --> 00:55:09,850
until this girl was of age so he could
fucking painter Jesus Christ. I got I,

879
00:55:09,870 --> 00:55:11,820
you know, I might have to
stand up and applaud this one.

880
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:13,800
This guy has taken it to another level.

881
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:19,470
This is a fucking epic situation here.
So you can see. Here's my question.

882
00:55:20,910 --> 00:55:25,650
Does that proposition mean anything?
Do you need my advice?

883
00:55:25,651 --> 00:55:29,310
I need advice from you. How do you
fuck every girl in the same family?

884
00:55:31,530 --> 00:55:35,040
Jesus Christ. This is
like, you know, Long.

885
00:55:35,220 --> 00:55:39,000
There's been an expense since has been
a triple crown winner in horse racing.

886
00:55:40,170 --> 00:55:42,660
The last time someone
won the Kentucky Derby,

887
00:55:42,661 --> 00:55:44,130
the Preakness and the breeders' Cup.

888
00:55:44,490 --> 00:55:47,070
Is that what it is or is that a
soccer match? I don't fucking know.

889
00:55:47,430 --> 00:55:51,570
I don't own a fucking horse since the
late seventies I would guarantee that it's

890
00:55:51,571 --> 00:55:55,710
been since the late seventies since
somebody has booze bank three.

891
00:55:56,100 --> 00:56:00,330
I think a lot can do two in one family,
but to get all fucking three,

892
00:56:01,980 --> 00:56:02,813
two,
three,

893
00:56:03,060 --> 00:56:07,410
two is a respectable three is it?
No,

894
00:56:07,411 --> 00:56:10,170
it's beyond respectable. Two. Three. Okay.

895
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:12,540
Everybody knows three is in
the sporting world too. That,

896
00:56:12,541 --> 00:56:15,360
that's a fucking dynasty.
Okay.

897
00:56:15,870 --> 00:56:18,240
You just put yourself in there
with fucking Bill Russell.

898
00:56:19,350 --> 00:56:22,470
You put yourself in there with,
with, with the fucking, uh,

899
00:56:24,070 --> 00:56:28,960
Magic Johnson Lakers. You know,
I wouldn't say the Colby Lakers.

900
00:56:28,990 --> 00:56:32,010
You know when you go out and you get
Phil Jackson and fucking shack that,

901
00:56:32,470 --> 00:56:35,890
that's that new ship that the kids
like. I don't like that shit. Um,

902
00:56:37,330 --> 00:56:39,730
either way, dude, you're
talking fucking dynasty. Wait,

903
00:56:39,790 --> 00:56:40,930
magic never won three in a row,

904
00:56:40,931 --> 00:56:43,210
but he had the Celtics to fuck with
and they went three out of four years.

905
00:56:43,211 --> 00:56:46,300
Give me a fucking break. Um, so
here's Michael Jordan. There we go.

906
00:56:46,450 --> 00:56:50,650
So here's my question. Does that
proposition mean anything? Is it a trap?

907
00:56:51,010 --> 00:56:52,690
Should I try to bang her?

908
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:58,240
Should I try and bang her too and get a
third strike or keep my dick in my pants

909
00:56:58,270 --> 00:57:01,720
and avoid a potential shit storm?
And if yes,

910
00:57:02,320 --> 00:57:06,370
do you have any tips,
special tips on this special situation?

911
00:57:06,700 --> 00:57:09,970
All my friends are telling me to do so,
but I thought I'd ask them.

912
00:57:10,120 --> 00:57:13,210
We'll refine mine like yourselves
before I did a move. Dude,

913
00:57:13,730 --> 00:57:16,990
you're looking at me like, dude,
you're beyond me right now. Okay.

914
00:57:17,080 --> 00:57:21,310
This is like Bull Durham. I'm, I'm fucking
Kevin Costner. Um, I'm, I'm a lifer.

915
00:57:22,300 --> 00:57:23,190
Okay.
You're,

916
00:57:23,260 --> 00:57:26,820
you're going up to the show hidden brand
new balls every fucking day. I will.

917
00:57:26,860 --> 00:57:31,450
You tell me. Okay. I never banked
to girls in one fucking family.

918
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:32,770
You know,

919
00:57:32,770 --> 00:57:36,310
I was psyched if I was able to tag a
couple of friends and we were all hanging

920
00:57:36,311 --> 00:57:39,220
out at a bar one night and you get that
feeling like I fucked both of you and

921
00:57:39,310 --> 00:57:42,520
you both knew it and you both
loved it. I hope. Please,

922
00:57:42,610 --> 00:57:45,580
please tell me you liked it.
Did you like it was I okay? Um,

923
00:57:48,190 --> 00:57:53,110
dude, I think you gotta do
it. You gotta do it. You know,

924
00:57:53,350 --> 00:57:57,190
you, you've been above board the whole
time. Sister [inaudible] sister be,

925
00:57:57,191 --> 00:58:00,280
they all fucking knew everything right
now I understand this is a little

926
00:58:00,281 --> 00:58:04,520
delicate. Okay. He's trying to snip the
last wire here. This is the kid sister is,

927
00:58:04,540 --> 00:58:08,560
is it going to blow up in your
fucking face? Uh, it's worth it, dude.

928
00:58:09,790 --> 00:58:14,590
It's worth it. It's worth losing a
couple of limbs and you nose on this one.

929
00:58:14,830 --> 00:58:18,790
You got to do it to fuck. You know, dude,

930
00:58:18,791 --> 00:58:23,620
what the fuck she says to you? I,

931
00:58:23,621 --> 00:58:23,870
yeah,

932
00:58:23,870 --> 00:58:27,670
you're a painter all let me take my
clothes off and get paid my fucking Twat.

933
00:58:28,180 --> 00:58:31,060
That's not art too. That's
foreplay. Give me a fucking break.

934
00:58:31,210 --> 00:58:33,430
It'd be one thing if you're
in a classroom of people,

935
00:58:34,060 --> 00:58:38,260
it's just you and she's
standing there naked. Dude.

936
00:58:38,290 --> 00:58:40,870
That's like one of the two.
Have they ever done that porn senate?

937
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:44,500
That scenario in a porno Jesus Christ,
you might've found a new angle

938
00:58:47,240 --> 00:58:52,150
to. That's phenomenal. That is fucking
phenomenal, dude. You gotta do it.

939
00:58:53,830 --> 00:58:56,590
You got to do with the John Elway.
We're tired when he only got one.

940
00:58:56,591 --> 00:58:58,930
He came back for another,
right?

941
00:59:01,260 --> 00:59:04,690
You got to do it to w
two.

942
00:59:04,840 --> 00:59:06,970
That's like when Bush
fucking the first Bush.

943
00:59:07,390 --> 00:59:11,830
He stopped and he didn't get to sit down.
You got to go all the way on this one,

944
00:59:11,831 --> 00:59:14,500
man.
All right?

945
00:59:15,640 --> 00:59:20,380
You gotta be like Marlon Brando in fucking
apocalypse now. You just, you just,

946
00:59:20,410 --> 00:59:24,570
you just the fact you left the program,
all right?

947
00:59:25,290 --> 00:59:26,123
And

948
00:59:27,750 --> 00:59:31,350
I don't care how mad
these girls get to do.

949
00:59:31,351 --> 00:59:36,351
You are at the precipice of
becoming an absolute fucking legend

950
00:59:39,900 --> 00:59:43,210
Ledge who, who can, who, who's
gonna be able to top that dude?

951
00:59:43,211 --> 00:59:47,960
There are celebrities who've had orgies
that had five on ones and all that type

952
00:59:47,961 --> 00:59:50,750
of Shit, okay? But I guarantee you,

953
00:59:50,751 --> 00:59:55,751
they never fucked three fucking girls
in the same family when they weren't

954
00:59:55,941 --> 01:00:00,890
famous, not famous. You're doing
this shit with the gift of Gab.

955
01:00:00,891 --> 01:00:03,770
Whatever the fuck you doing do you
do this? You got to write a book.

956
01:00:05,330 --> 01:00:06,860
You got to write a book that's for,
you know,

957
01:00:06,890 --> 01:00:11,390
that's used to collection of the most
amazing pussy getting stories ever that

958
01:00:11,391 --> 01:00:14,280
you can somehow confirm,
all right?

959
01:00:14,760 --> 01:00:18,120
And it has to be none of that bullshit.
The second you get famous, he get money.

960
01:00:18,121 --> 01:00:21,540
That doesn't count, all right?
That's garbage time, okay?

961
01:00:21,541 --> 01:00:24,710
They put the fucking second team in
there and you just fucking Titone layups.

962
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:28,200
That's bullshit.
I'm talking about just regular dudes.

963
01:00:28,220 --> 01:00:30,720
You talk yourself into it through
the year, you're a fucking legend.

964
01:00:31,180 --> 01:00:34,260
You gotta do it. All right.
There's my halftime speech.

965
01:00:35,410 --> 01:00:36,870
I'm going to quote Joe Barton.

966
01:00:37,170 --> 01:00:42,170
Nick quoting John Madden today is going
to be the greatest day of your life,

967
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:46,140
but only if you win.

968
01:01:30,900 --> 01:01:31,733
[inaudible] [inaudible]

969
01:01:32,560 --> 01:01:35,770
the way I think it's time.
I think we're about 17 minutes in.

970
01:01:35,771 --> 01:01:39,750
I think it's about time. I patted
myself on the back. How bout that?

971
01:01:39,751 --> 01:01:43,110
Download speed last week.
Huh? How about that?

972
01:01:43,890 --> 01:01:48,780
I didn't hear any complaining. You know,
hundreds and hundreds of people bitch,

973
01:01:49,130 --> 01:01:49,963
Moan and fuck.
Woo.

974
01:01:53,850 --> 01:01:58,390
Right? So I finally fixed the
Goddamn problem and what do I get?

975
01:01:58,391 --> 01:02:01,270
I get like five tweets going,
hey, I really appreciate it.

976
01:02:01,810 --> 01:02:03,460
You know what happened in the rest of you?

977
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:05,470
Because you went on to
bitch about something else.

978
01:02:05,890 --> 01:02:09,460
You don't like the photo on
my fucking page. You know,

979
01:02:09,640 --> 01:02:11,140
you have to stop and thinking about,
you know,

980
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:14,800
maybe finding out what you're
really upset about Jesus Christ.

981
01:02:14,801 --> 01:02:19,090
Could I use that advice?
Huh? Um, all right,

982
01:02:19,560 --> 01:02:23,530
let's talk about something in the
news. Shall we, you know, I think they,

983
01:02:23,640 --> 01:02:27,840
they should have to fucking sing the news
the way they do in the Catholic church.

984
01:02:28,930 --> 01:02:29,370
You know,

985
01:02:29,370 --> 01:02:34,370
there was a guy who got attacked
by two monkeys in South Africa.

986
01:02:38,700 --> 01:02:43,680
He decided he was going to go down
there and try to rehabilitate some

987
01:02:43,681 --> 01:02:48,330
chimpanzees that had been abused and
they turn around and drag them for two

988
01:02:48,331 --> 01:02:53,310
kilometers and kicked the shit out of him.
What a dumb fuck.

989
01:02:54,300 --> 01:02:58,800
Why would you fly across the world
to get your fucking ass kicked?

990
01:02:59,360 --> 01:03:02,690
Did you guys hear about
the student South Africa,

991
01:03:02,690 --> 01:03:05,900
Texas student attacked by chimp improves.

992
01:03:06,950 --> 01:03:11,480
Thank God he improves this poor
fucking bastard. He's a ranger, right?

993
01:03:11,660 --> 01:03:15,290
He loves animals.
This is the thing about animal lovers.

994
01:03:15,410 --> 01:03:20,410
You got to realize that once you go past
a certain level of domestic animal and

995
01:03:20,931 --> 01:03:24,170
you start getting into the wild,
no matter how much you love them,

996
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:25,490
they're not going to love you back.

997
01:03:30,200 --> 01:03:34,490
Wild animals are like that. Dick,
you shouldn't have gone out with,

998
01:03:35,100 --> 01:03:36,950
you know that person who cheated on you,

999
01:03:36,980 --> 01:03:41,540
that person who just doesn't have your
back. Wild animals do not have your back.

1000
01:03:41,960 --> 01:03:45,500
You dog has your back,
you cat borderline.

1001
01:03:46,250 --> 01:03:49,840
Cats kind of have that creepy vibe that
if shit went bad, they decide what the,

1002
01:03:49,841 --> 01:03:54,500
the intruder, you know what I mean? Fish.

1003
01:03:54,530 --> 01:03:58,940
They just don't have any fucking say.
They're like a Stepford wife, you know?

1004
01:03:59,390 --> 01:04:03,800
That's why dogs are the best. They,
it's they truly fucking love you.

1005
01:04:04,310 --> 01:04:06,350
My dog fucking loves me,

1006
01:04:06,470 --> 01:04:08,480
will be on a walk and all of
a sudden she just look up me.

1007
01:04:08,481 --> 01:04:13,190
It's almost like she's smiling. You
know how fucking warped, why sound?

1008
01:04:13,850 --> 01:04:17,090
She's probably just panting and it looks
like she's smiling and he's probably

1009
01:04:17,091 --> 01:04:19,790
going like, why does he have
this fucking rope around my neck?

1010
01:04:20,560 --> 01:04:22,400
This doesn't make any sense to me.
If I really wanted to,

1011
01:04:22,401 --> 01:04:25,490
I could rip his fucking face off,
but in my world,

1012
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:27,950
I'm so in love with my dog and look,
she's smiling,

1013
01:04:29,660 --> 01:04:33,710
but that's not bad when you just have a
dog. I think people who fucking, you know,

1014
01:04:35,210 --> 01:04:38,900
fuck with animals for awhile, wild
animals, they start thinking like, oh,

1015
01:04:38,901 --> 01:04:43,820
look at the Cheetah. Oh, she's play
a Gig and all of a sudden grow off.

1016
01:04:43,821 --> 01:04:47,990
This fucking launches itself that you
all right.

1017
01:04:49,400 --> 01:04:53,860
I believe that we came from monkeys.
I believe that we came from the apes.

1018
01:04:54,590 --> 01:04:57,710
I believe something else. So there's
three in a row in this sound smooth.

1019
01:04:59,690 --> 01:05:03,890
Um, but I by no means think that, uh,

1020
01:05:03,950 --> 01:05:05,330
that those fucking things like us,

1021
01:05:05,360 --> 01:05:09,260
I don't give a shit if I teach at sign
language and the chimps sitting at going

1022
01:05:09,261 --> 01:05:12,800
in sign language. Hey, I think you're
a cool guy there. Freckled face count.

1023
01:05:13,070 --> 01:05:18,070
You know that there's no fucking way I'm
ever going on the other side of the God

1024
01:05:18,970 --> 01:05:21,460
damn cage.
This poor bastard was on the other,

1025
01:05:21,461 --> 01:05:24,460
he was on the other side of the cage.
He just got too close.

1026
01:05:26,740 --> 01:05:31,270
That's how fucking insane a
wild animal is. Chimpanzees,

1027
01:05:31,271 --> 01:05:35,110
they say have the strength of six,
six men.

1028
01:05:36,460 --> 01:05:40,870
This dude got attacked by two chimps
that would be like getting attacked by a

1029
01:05:40,871 --> 01:05:44,770
flash mob. Okay. 12 fucking people.

1030
01:05:44,980 --> 01:05:49,540
They just grabbed this motherfucker by
his ankles. They reached underneath.

1031
01:05:49,900 --> 01:05:53,920
I mean, I don't what kind of bullshit cage
they had was like a compound, you know?

1032
01:05:53,921 --> 01:05:56,710
So they put up that, that,
that cheap wire shit,

1033
01:05:56,711 --> 01:06:00,070
when you don't want to rabbit to come
in and eat your lettuce right in your

1034
01:06:00,071 --> 01:06:04,300
garden. Like they put that
shit up. So this fucking guy
is sitting there, you know,

1035
01:06:04,420 --> 01:06:06,850
as they go doing that shit and he's like,

1036
01:06:06,940 --> 01:06:08,980
what are you guys join the show
me where you're telling me right?

1037
01:06:08,981 --> 01:06:12,580
And he's trying to sign to him. You
guys want to play Frisbee, right?

1038
01:06:12,670 --> 01:06:15,100
And they sitting there talking to
each other going just two more inches,

1039
01:06:15,340 --> 01:06:18,610
two more inches. Look at this dumb mother
fucker and wants to play Frisbee. Right?

1040
01:06:18,620 --> 01:06:22,090
They reach underneath,
grab them by his fucking ankles.

1041
01:06:24,190 --> 01:06:27,940
Strength. The 12 men, they fucking pull
them right underneath that goddamn thing.

1042
01:06:28,060 --> 01:06:31,150
Like when you go to Quiznos and they
stick your sub right through that poor

1043
01:06:31,151 --> 01:06:36,151
excuse for a fucking a brick oven
yanked fucker right underneath.

1044
01:06:37,750 --> 01:06:42,610
Oh my God. And then they dragged them
for like another fucking two kilometers,

1045
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:47,620
however fucking far that is. I
don't know. In my world. That's a,

1046
01:06:47,621 --> 01:06:51,610
what's that about? A mile and a quarter.
Cause I know like 40 kilometers,

1047
01:06:51,680 --> 01:06:54,370
like 60 kilometers is like 40
miles an hour. Who gives a fuck?

1048
01:06:54,371 --> 01:06:59,170
They dragged this son of a bitch basically
through the length of every football

1049
01:06:59,171 --> 01:07:03,970
stadium in the NFL and I can guarantee
you it wasn't the nice turf that those

1050
01:07:03,971 --> 01:07:07,030
guys play on.
This was the natural habitat.

1051
01:07:07,030 --> 01:07:10,600
Like I can't imagine
the vice grip strength,

1052
01:07:12,010 --> 01:07:15,250
those, those fucking things, man, they'll
rip your foot off the rip your balls off,

1053
01:07:15,251 --> 01:07:17,950
the rip your face off the rip it off.

1054
01:07:18,010 --> 01:07:20,680
Like you open a fucking Goddamn thing,

1055
01:07:20,681 --> 01:07:24,340
a yogurt goddamn ice cream
when you just take the lid off,

1056
01:07:24,341 --> 01:07:28,390
they do that to your face. What the fuck
are you doing near these goddamn things?

1057
01:07:29,500 --> 01:07:33,190
You know
Jesus fucking Christ.

1058
01:07:33,191 --> 01:07:36,820
I would have to tranquilize had guns and
I would be wearing one of those fucking,

1059
01:07:37,090 --> 01:07:39,580
you know those suits you wear when you
think you're going to get bitten by a

1060
01:07:39,581 --> 01:07:43,180
shark, that chain link shit,
there's no fucking way.

1061
01:07:44,260 --> 01:07:47,980
There's no way fucking catcher's
mask welded to my face.

1062
01:07:49,540 --> 01:07:51,130
I'm not going anywhere in here.
And not only that,

1063
01:07:51,190 --> 01:07:54,340
these aren't just regular fucking chimps
that have been swinging around eating

1064
01:07:54,820 --> 01:07:58,960
bananas occasionally eating
another monkey alive, right?

1065
01:08:00,490 --> 01:08:03,430
This isn't that shit.
These are ones that were abused.

1066
01:08:03,490 --> 01:08:06,340
They were already fucked with.
Okay.

1067
01:08:06,760 --> 01:08:11,260
And having adopted a
fucking abused dog and

1068
01:08:12,790 --> 01:08:15,040
the Goddamn Skitzo Shit that that
thing does, I can't fucking imagine

1069
01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:20,410
a goddamn schizophrenia fucking
ate two of them straight to 12 God,

1070
01:08:20,490 --> 01:08:24,710
they are men and you're going to walk
near the cage trying to sign, hey,

1071
01:08:24,711 --> 01:08:28,160
how about the weather frank or
whatever she fucking human name.

1072
01:08:28,161 --> 01:08:30,800
You gave him your at you already
a fuck and God bless you,

1073
01:08:31,190 --> 01:08:31,881
your heart's in the right place.

1074
01:08:31,881 --> 01:08:35,150
Fortunately this kid doesn't seem
like he had any damage like that,

1075
01:08:35,151 --> 01:08:37,280
but like this dude was so in shock,

1076
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:42,230
like they were finally able to just
like stitch him up and stabilize him and

1077
01:08:42,231 --> 01:08:45,230
evidently he's not in critical
condition and it doesn't seem like,

1078
01:08:45,860 --> 01:08:49,400
it seems like he still has his balls,
his feet and his face,

1079
01:08:50,030 --> 01:08:51,830
which is incredible.
But they say, you know,

1080
01:08:51,860 --> 01:08:56,860
he has bite marks and
a and fractures plural.

1081
01:08:58,820 --> 01:09:01,160
Oh my God,
just treating you like a fucking rag doll.

1082
01:09:01,730 --> 01:09:05,580
That is the most horrifying
shit in the world to meet.

1083
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:09,230
Nature is the most horrifying
shit I would rather have.

1084
01:09:10,680 --> 01:09:12,350
Oh, let's see. You know
what? The human equivalent,

1085
01:09:12,351 --> 01:09:14,990
someone has to come into my
house with a fucking chainsaw.

1086
01:09:15,500 --> 01:09:19,010
I can deal with the Goddamn,
I could deal with the machete.

1087
01:09:19,880 --> 01:09:23,450
All right. I could deal with that.
Chainsaws that, that's hardcore.

1088
01:09:23,480 --> 01:09:27,750
I could fuck a machete. I could deal
with, I think I could fucking do the, the,

1089
01:09:27,890 --> 01:09:28,940
the sugar ray Leonard,
you know,

1090
01:09:28,941 --> 01:09:32,360
stick my face out and then pull it back
when he took a swing and then fucking

1091
01:09:32,550 --> 01:09:33,560
try to take both of your legs out.

1092
01:09:38,650 --> 01:09:39,370
Yeah.

1093
01:09:39,370 --> 01:09:44,240
Ah, only hardcore boxing fans
got that one. Um, but the,

1094
01:09:44,241 --> 01:09:49,241
I mean if you were in a room with the
chimp and that thing goes fucking ape shit

1095
01:09:49,420 --> 01:09:53,230
, no pun intended. That thing is on
the floor. It's up on the ceiling.

1096
01:09:53,231 --> 01:09:55,090
It's across the room.
It's like,

1097
01:09:56,710 --> 01:10:00,670
it's like a comet and you're sitting
there dealing with human speed

1098
01:10:03,270 --> 01:10:05,710
do.
That's why we got the brains that we have.

1099
01:10:06,910 --> 01:10:11,140
This why was so much smarter. We have
to be because we're so fucking slow.

1100
01:10:12,820 --> 01:10:13,653
You know what I mean?

1101
01:10:14,290 --> 01:10:17,230
You ever see the white guy who gets
dunked on in those highlight films?

1102
01:10:17,470 --> 01:10:22,470
You know that fucking guy that they bring
off the bench when the teams either up

1103
01:10:22,631 --> 01:10:27,010
by 30 or down by 30 that guy,
that's what we are in nature.

1104
01:10:27,430 --> 01:10:31,720
Even the fucking athletic humans yet you
know when nowhere near just take like a

1105
01:10:31,721 --> 01:10:36,550
how fast a fucking snake is
a fucking pit viper, viper,

1106
01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:41,380
righteous, nothing. Fucking, you don't
eat your bit and that thing has left,

1107
01:10:41,680 --> 01:10:44,120
left the fucking building
before you even did,

1108
01:10:44,140 --> 01:10:48,250
before that signal from
your fucking leg going, hey,

1109
01:10:48,251 --> 01:10:52,000
we just got bit by a Goddamn pit
viper even reaches your brain.

1110
01:10:52,090 --> 01:10:53,500
That snake is already leaving

1111
01:10:55,840 --> 01:10:57,460
and then you go and then the real is,

1112
01:10:57,700 --> 01:11:00,430
and as the realization that
you got bit hits you, you are,

1113
01:11:00,431 --> 01:11:04,330
you're already collapsing.
Why the fuck would you go out there?

1114
01:11:05,920 --> 01:11:08,320
You know, I don't know. We
had to be that fucking smart.

1115
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:14,620
I can't imagine that the Goddamn
fear back in the fucking day,

1116
01:11:15,370 --> 01:11:18,380
you're walking around with a bunch
of Goddamn neanderthals and whatever.

1117
01:11:18,630 --> 01:11:22,240
Niana talls I guess I suppose to say I
sit in the Andrew Thall my entire life,

1118
01:11:22,241 --> 01:11:27,040
but it's Neanderthal, I guess. And
what else was it? There was two tribes.

1119
01:11:27,041 --> 01:11:27,880
One of them died off.

1120
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:31,150
There was the enter talls and then
there was the fucking crow magnums.

1121
01:11:31,180 --> 01:11:35,230
And I forget what the fuck we are.
One of them, one and the other ones,

1122
01:11:36,100 --> 01:11:40,120
the other one of them's was a little
bit smarter and the other ones were a

1123
01:11:40,121 --> 01:11:43,450
little dumber and dumber ones died off.
All right.

1124
01:11:44,590 --> 01:11:48,520
And some people have a little bit of
that Crow Magnum or Neanderthal in them,

1125
01:11:48,940 --> 01:11:52,420
you know, because you know
that people they fuck right.

1126
01:11:53,560 --> 01:11:57,160
It's gotta be the dumbest
education of podcasts you've,

1127
01:11:57,161 --> 01:11:58,150
you'll ever gonna fucking here.

1128
01:11:59,300 --> 01:12:00,110
Yeah.

1129
01:12:00,110 --> 01:12:03,020
I just totally lost my train of thought.
What the fuck was I talking about? Oh,

1130
01:12:03,360 --> 01:12:04,193
Niana toss.
Right.

1131
01:12:05,120 --> 01:12:09,470
So I can't imagine just
fucking walking around.

1132
01:12:10,040 --> 01:12:12,470
Did you ever see that shit when they did
that whole thing on chrome Madigan's in

1133
01:12:13,060 --> 01:12:14,900
neanderthals,
like one of them was like fucking slower,

1134
01:12:14,901 --> 01:12:19,070
like the fucking white dude in the NBA
and one of them was a little bit quicker,

1135
01:12:19,130 --> 01:12:20,090
a little bit smarter.

1136
01:12:20,690 --> 01:12:24,050
So they fucking did this shit where like
when they would show him like taking

1137
01:12:24,051 --> 01:12:28,910
down some prehistoric bison, like the
fucking little smarter ones, you know,

1138
01:12:28,940 --> 01:12:31,580
they could fucking, you know that
that Shit, they could slip a punch,

1139
01:12:31,581 --> 01:12:33,350
they could throw a goddamn spear.
They could do,

1140
01:12:33,351 --> 01:12:38,120
they could do it from a fucking distance.
Like this fucking jackass. He wasn't,

1141
01:12:38,210 --> 01:12:42,350
he was too close to the Goddamn cage.
The fucking Chromatin is whatever.

1142
01:12:42,351 --> 01:12:46,520
The dumber ones they would like
fucking day would just brute strength.

1143
01:12:46,520 --> 01:12:49,490
They would fucking run and try to tackle
the thing and someone would, you know,

1144
01:12:49,491 --> 01:12:50,810
separate their shoulder,

1145
01:12:50,811 --> 01:12:54,230
a break and elbow and there's
nobody around a set that shit.

1146
01:12:55,430 --> 01:12:59,930
Every step in your fucking non-existence
shoes, your big stupid prehistoric foot.

1147
01:13:01,470 --> 01:13:04,490
It's just shoving that pain shoot through
your body. I edged. Can't imagine,

1148
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:09,530
I can't imagine sitting there looking
out of a cave in everything is that much

1149
01:13:09,531 --> 01:13:14,210
faster than me and I don't have a
fucking door. I don't have a gun.

1150
01:13:15,830 --> 01:13:17,540
He just must be just
sitting here like any,

1151
01:13:17,541 --> 01:13:21,260
can't really communicate to the other
person because language hasn't been

1152
01:13:21,261 --> 01:13:24,470
developed yet, so you just haven't
that. What the fuck? Look on your face.

1153
01:13:24,471 --> 01:13:28,970
That was probably one of the
first phrases invented like,

1154
01:13:28,971 --> 01:13:31,370
are you shitting me or the killer?
Can you fucking believe this?

1155
01:13:36,560 --> 01:13:39,230
I Dunno, but God bless that
dude. You're an animal lover.

1156
01:13:39,231 --> 01:13:42,170
I totally know where you're coming from,
but for the love of fucking God,

1157
01:13:42,171 --> 01:13:44,120
those things are not your friends.

1158
01:13:45,620 --> 01:13:46,453
Okay?

1159
01:13:48,440 --> 01:13:53,120
I Dunno. Start p nine dx in and stay away
from that fucking cage. Jesus Christ.

1160
01:13:53,121 --> 01:13:54,290
Can you imagine that

1161
01:13:56,670 --> 01:14:01,670
I am getting dragged away by
two fucking abused chimps.

1162
01:14:04,190 --> 01:14:07,130
Then you know God damn well he saw
that fucking Oprah won't episode.

1163
01:14:07,131 --> 01:14:10,310
That woman came on with no face. I know
he was fucking thinking of that shit.

1164
01:14:12,310 --> 01:14:15,520
I hate those motherfuckers. You
know what? As I like gorillas.

1165
01:14:15,850 --> 01:14:18,220
I hate chimpanzees and I
hate those little monkeys,

1166
01:14:18,520 --> 01:14:20,440
the little motherfuckers
that throw their shit at you.

1167
01:14:20,740 --> 01:14:23,140
I can't stand those fuckers.
And I hate chimpanzees.

1168
01:14:23,141 --> 01:14:26,620
I always hated those motherfuckers. I
didn't know why. And now I know why.

1169
01:14:26,800 --> 01:14:31,800
That was my inner fucking whatever
the fuck caveman telling me.

1170
01:14:34,150 --> 01:14:36,430
Get the fuck out. Go
back to the cave. Stupid.

1171
01:14:39,100 --> 01:14:42,970
I don't trust them. I don't, I
don't trust those fucking things.

1172
01:14:43,180 --> 01:14:44,620
You have to go to the
zoo and you just fucking,

1173
01:14:44,621 --> 01:14:46,570
you just your eyes meet with like a lion.

1174
01:14:48,010 --> 01:14:52,680
Just that fucking look on
their face when they, they,

1175
01:14:52,780 --> 01:14:55,120
they should.
I've said this before,

1176
01:14:55,121 --> 01:14:58,550
it's like the same look like when
a hooker looks at you like it's,

1177
01:14:58,570 --> 01:15:00,910
it's the real deal.
You know,

1178
01:15:01,950 --> 01:15:05,190
this isn't some fucking bullshit.
Flirting, playing hard to get,

1179
01:15:05,191 --> 01:15:09,700
get a couple of drinks out
of you. It's, yeah, you got
20 bucks, I will suck a dick.

1180
01:15:10,240 --> 01:15:13,960
What? You know, lions got
that same look on their face.

1181
01:15:15,340 --> 01:15:16,330
Like, yeah, if you know,

1182
01:15:16,360 --> 01:15:19,150
if you weren't in that fucking armored
vehicle or on the other side of this,

1183
01:15:19,151 --> 01:15:23,380
yeah. If I was hungry, I would eat you.
And uh, no matter how much you screened,

1184
01:15:23,381 --> 01:15:24,010
I wouldn't give a shit.

1185
01:15:24,010 --> 01:15:28,840
It'll actually excite me more to rip
your fucking head off. There's no way.

1186
01:15:30,520 --> 01:15:34,750
There's no way. There's no fucking way.
That's why I watch all those animals.

1187
01:15:34,751 --> 01:15:36,640
Thanks, man. I'm fascinated, and I, and I,

1188
01:15:36,870 --> 01:15:41,320
I appreciate all those people that put
themselves in harm's way because there's

1189
01:15:41,321 --> 01:15:45,400
no other way to really gauge how strong
an animal is until you see it slap

1190
01:15:45,401 --> 01:15:46,420
around a human being.
Like,

1191
01:15:46,421 --> 01:15:50,030
I can't watch too fucking grizzly bears
wrestle and slap each other. They're,

1192
01:15:50,190 --> 01:15:51,850
they're in the same weight class.
You know what I mean?

1193
01:15:51,880 --> 01:15:55,430
If I see him bitch slap a human being,

1194
01:15:55,560 --> 01:15:58,180
then I'm and watched the guys heads spin
around a couple of, I was like, wow.

1195
01:15:59,310 --> 01:16:02,560
All right, I get that. I can now
gauge that. Let's like, yeah, like,

1196
01:16:02,620 --> 01:16:06,640
like a kilometers versus miles.
All right.

1197
01:16:06,641 --> 01:16:07,690
I think we killed that subject.

1198
01:16:08,210 --> 01:16:09,043
MMM.

1199
01:16:14,300 --> 01:16:15,133
[inaudible]

1200
01:17:09,910 --> 01:17:09,910
[inaudible].
