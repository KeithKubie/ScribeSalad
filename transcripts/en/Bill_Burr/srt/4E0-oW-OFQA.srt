1
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:03,300
Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn.

2
00:00:03,301 --> 00:00:07,770
It's time for the Monday morning
podcast for Monday, September 4th,

3
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:12,060
2017 how's it going? How? Why
you happy fucking Labor Day.

4
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:17,550
Happy Labor Day. Happy Labor Day.

5
00:00:17,551 --> 00:00:21,660
You don't have to go to
fucking work unless you're
the guy that owns the fucking

6
00:00:21,661 --> 00:00:24,220
business then you never
get to sleep, do ya?

7
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:27,060
You should have stuck
with your first wife,

8
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:32,720
but you threw her out and now you got a
fucking 20 something fucking car and she

9
00:00:34,561 --> 00:00:37,770
wants to spend all your money.
Alright, sorry. Anyways,

10
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,430
how you know something you
worked hard all year. God dammit.

11
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:45,240
It's nice that you got a
fucking a Monday off, isn't it?

12
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:48,000
Don't you wish it was
the way it is in Europe?

13
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:49,810
Okay.

14
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:50,920
I don't know how they do it over there.

15
00:00:50,921 --> 00:00:52,960
You know they all got
fucking health insurance.

16
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:56,230
They get like 53 weeks off a year.

17
00:00:56,410 --> 00:00:59,650
Then have like the whole fucking
continent shuts down in August.

18
00:00:59,651 --> 00:01:01,600
Everybody just says fuck
it. We're not working.

19
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:05,260
And somehow it keeps going.

20
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:10,630
Is it because their countries are so
small doll? Look at the little country.

21
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:11,860
Is that what it is?

22
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:14,330
Okay.

23
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:16,480
Over here is so fucking
big. You know, just a mow.

24
00:01:16,481 --> 00:01:21,240
Your yard takes half the God damn summer
over here. All of us fat Fox wall,

25
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:26,460
Elon around a giant pieces of property
rad in a four wheeler shooting a guns.

26
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:32,780
You fucking live over there in
Europe, man. You get, you got nothing.

27
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:35,300
You got to flat, you know,

28
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:38,840
you and five other guys
fucking addicted to heroin.

29
00:01:38,841 --> 00:01:42,230
When some baby drowns in a toilet
or whatever that fucking movie was,

30
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,060
you know you got nothing.

31
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:47,000
Or maybe maybe you got a house
and it's got like the fucking,

32
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:51,080
it's got that roof that looks like a
bale of hay that someone braided in.

33
00:01:51,081 --> 00:01:55,920
It looks like a weave but with like,
hey, I don't know what it is over there,

34
00:01:55,921 --> 00:01:59,250
but all I know is they still have castles.

35
00:01:59,251 --> 00:02:03,570
Some of them still have kings and queens
and they get, they get like August off,

36
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:06,900
just off. You know when
they get free health care,

37
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:11,360
they pay a bunch of fucking
taxes. But I gotta be honest,

38
00:02:11,361 --> 00:02:14,270
you pay a bunch of taxes here too. I
think it's just because we're bigger.

39
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:17,870
Got The wide open fucking roads.
I'm going to go with that.

40
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:21,350
I'm going to go with that and I'm never
going to read up about it and that's

41
00:02:21,351 --> 00:02:24,550
what I'm going to say. If that topics
ever brought up like, Hey, I'll come back,

42
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:29,570
come they get all this vacation time
and if a woman as a kid over there, Raj,

43
00:02:29,571 --> 00:02:32,600
she doesn't have to be backward
to work on Monday, I'll come.

44
00:02:32,601 --> 00:02:35,960
That is because there are
little tiny countries, you know,

45
00:02:35,961 --> 00:02:38,420
they have little tiny hospitals, you know,

46
00:02:38,421 --> 00:02:42,560
a little tiny teeth that they don't
brush. You know, it's, it's, it's Europe.

47
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:47,560
What do you mean? What do you do? That's
why their cars go better into corners.

48
00:02:47,561 --> 00:02:50,230
They have a little tiny streets and
they gotta they gotta zigzag around some

49
00:02:50,231 --> 00:02:53,260
shit. You know that, that's basically
what it is. It's not like America.

50
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:55,870
Some woman gives birth on Friday,

51
00:02:55,871 --> 00:03:00,040
the eight gene makes sure you're
fucking here on Monday, pumped that kid

52
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:02,020
out, do whatever it is you got to do.

53
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:04,430
Yeah. Have you gotten a stick?

54
00:03:04,431 --> 00:03:08,330
A weed wacker of ROR a fucking reverse
blower up there and suck the kid out and

55
00:03:08,331 --> 00:03:11,180
be back to work. We'll give you Monday
off. Then you gotta be here on Tuesday.

56
00:03:11,181 --> 00:03:12,290
That's how it works here in America

57
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:13,880
now.

58
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:18,880
Everybody wanted his why was so fat
has nothing to do with our poison food.

59
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:23,090
We're just stressed. You know,

60
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:26,550
if you guys didn't have a whole month
to August off over there in Europe,

61
00:03:26,551 --> 00:03:31,110
I'd love to see if you guys actually
had to fucking work over there and worry

62
00:03:31,111 --> 00:03:35,070
about, you know, I need a new pancreas.
How am I going to afford that?

63
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:39,720
Right. Which is easily the cost
of at least three flat screen TVs.

64
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:44,070
That's the going rate for a pancreas,
if I remember correctly. All right.

65
00:03:44,071 --> 00:03:45,150
If you are dealing with that stress,

66
00:03:45,151 --> 00:03:49,550
I'd like to see how many fucking
doughnuts you be eating, you know, uh,

67
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:54,330
speaking of which, uh,
Billy, no fun. Billy,

68
00:03:54,331 --> 00:03:57,060
no fun. His on his 18th day of not Busan,

69
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:03,000
18 days, not Booz and I
barely even remember what it
tastes like at this point.

70
00:04:03,001 --> 00:04:07,200
You know, I'm dropping weight. This
is the time of night when it sucks.

71
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:13,050
Um, you know, in the morning
it's great. I wake up,

72
00:04:13,051 --> 00:04:17,130
my stomach's flatter than it
was the day before. I feel good,

73
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:19,830
but it's like at night,
I mean, Sunday night,

74
00:04:19,831 --> 00:04:21,570
I don't have to go to work on Monday.

75
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:25,650
I have tomorrow off like all of you
guys while you're listening to it today,

76
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:30,220
you know, you can't tell me, you know. Um,

77
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:34,560
I mean as, as a fucking human being, I
have to go out and get fucking hammered.

78
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:37,500
Right. I mean

79
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:41,610
kind of. I mean, I, if I don't die, I
mean if I was running the CIA I'd be, oh,

80
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:45,590
there's this guy in Isis, see
some sort of religious fanatic.

81
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,840
Oh, Billy red cakes. Oh, Billy red velvet.

82
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:56,240
I'm staying away from the
sugar. I'm being an angel.

83
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:58,340
I'm being an angel cause I
might have some act and work in,

84
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,690
um, in October.

85
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:05,090
So, uh, I got to make sure I'm down to
my fighting weight of my fighting weight.

86
00:05:05,091 --> 00:05:08,810
A buck 72. That's what I need to
be at. Whenever I shoot something,

87
00:05:08,811 --> 00:05:12,290
you know all these fucking actresses
out here talk about how it's so hard for

88
00:05:12,291 --> 00:05:17,180
them is if a guy can go on and be a
bloated fat fucking nut, get shit for it.

89
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:20,660
Okay? That's not how it works.

90
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:23,000
They can get to you through social media.

91
00:05:23,001 --> 00:05:25,400
They go right at you and they tell
you that you're a bloated fed.

92
00:05:25,401 --> 00:05:30,170
Fuck what happened to you. You got
old, which a hair go, all of that shit.

93
00:05:30,171 --> 00:05:32,570
You know what I mean? But you know,
you know what it is about people.

94
00:05:32,571 --> 00:05:35,970
They look out their own
fucking heads. All right?

95
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,890
They look at the world
in a two dimensional way.
They look out their heads,

96
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:44,390
they observe something and then they put
it their head and they process it with

97
00:05:44,391 --> 00:05:48,380
their previous experience and
then to them that is the truth.

98
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:50,240
That is what's going on in the world.

99
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:53,510
They look at it from their fucking
angle and they don't realize it.

100
00:05:53,511 --> 00:05:55,160
That is 360 degrees,

101
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:59,480
which is why South Park is the greatest
fucking show of all time as far as I'm

102
00:05:59,481 --> 00:06:01,700
concerned, because the matter
what problem they attack,

103
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:03,950
they hit it from all sides. The red side,

104
00:06:03,951 --> 00:06:06,650
the blue side from the north to South
East, west. You know what I'm saying?

105
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:12,110
You're like dead. That was, that was
the longest fucking compliment ever. Ah,

106
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:16,190
Josh Adam Meyers from
the God damn comedy gym.

107
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:19,790
Josh Adam Meyers, Bill Barr. I'm
taping my Monday morning podcast.

108
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:21,770
You're one of our first
callers. How are you?

109
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:24,060
Good, good. I'm just curious.

110
00:06:24,061 --> 00:06:27,540
I could get your opinion on the
Kyrie Irving at dad's on the street.

111
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:29,460
I wasn't aware that that happened.

112
00:06:29,461 --> 00:06:31,860
Was that a big news story
in the world of sports?

113
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:35,230
Good. The little bit. Yeah. It's,
it's a few people know about it.

114
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:40,100
Uh, you know, as a, as a fucking lover
of the Celtics, as a Celtics lover.

115
00:06:40,101 --> 00:06:44,170
I hated the fucking trade because I loved
Isaiah. He was like a mini big PAPI.

116
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,720
He was on his way. He was going to
have a street named after him. But, uh,

117
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:50,630
that it's, it's a business
now and this all goes back,

118
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:54,800
I think to the Miami Heat, all
those pile on teams back to

119
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:59,630
the Coby Shack Lakers when whenever
it stopped being bird bird, Celtics,

120
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:02,720
magic Lakers, Isaiah fucking, uh,

121
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:07,130
Pistons Jordan with the
Bulls and everybody just
jumped around. Now it's over.

122
00:07:07,131 --> 00:07:08,810
I thought you wouldn't
ask about the cigar.

123
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:10,390
I am. That's what I
was saying. I was like,

124
00:07:10,391 --> 00:07:12,540
do you want me to give you some time
so you can finish this up and then,

125
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,790
no, I don't give a shit.

126
00:07:13,791 --> 00:07:16,580
Just ring the doorbell and I'll
stop and I'll finish it later.

127
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:17,813
All right. Costing a little bit.

128
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:20,630
Alright. Don't, I don't ring the doorbell.
My daughter's sleeping. Just text me.

129
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:24,970
All right. See Ya. Um, anyways,

130
00:07:24,971 --> 00:07:29,350
the most roundabout compliment
ever for South Park.

131
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:32,410
I had no idea it was going to say
that. So a, I am, as of this morning,

132
00:07:32,411 --> 00:07:36,970
I bought 179 pounds in
six ounces, one 79.6.

133
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:41,950
So I'm trying to lose three weeks and
next week on Friday, I need to be, uh,

134
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:47,860
I need to be one 77. I right.

135
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:51,040
Just said he hit pause him in the fucking
dog house. I just woke up my daughter.

136
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:55,220
Oh my God, my wife is
fucking pissed at me, boy.

137
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,440
[inaudible] all right.

138
00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:01,180
This is the Monday morning podcast
and I'm gonna be fucking whisper.

139
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:06,160
And for the rest of this God damn
thing, um, that was, I talked to my,

140
00:08:06,161 --> 00:08:06,401
yes.

141
00:08:06,401 --> 00:08:11,401
So next week I want to be 177 pounds by
a Friday and then one 74 the next week,

142
00:08:15,251 --> 00:08:17,710
and then I'll be one 71 and
then if I get this acting Gig,

143
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:20,980
I'll be where I need to be. Um,

144
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:24,430
so I was going to take a month off from
boozy, but if I get this acting Gig,

145
00:08:24,431 --> 00:08:29,110
then I'm just not going to booze like
right on through to the end of the fucking

146
00:08:29,111 --> 00:08:33,490
shoot. And then when
that's over, okay. Uh,

147
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:37,870
I'm gonna get like one of those kegerators
and I'm gonna fill it up with fucking

148
00:08:37,871 --> 00:08:38,704
whiskey

149
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:46,120
and I'm going to be underneath it
and it's gonna be glorious. Um,

150
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:51,520
I dunno. I Dunno what
my fucking problem is.

151
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:55,090
I should go to a meeting and
just see what that's like.

152
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,030
I went to a meeting a long time ago and
I got arrested for drinking and driving

153
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:04,170
and one of the requirements was you
had to go to a, uh, an AA meeting,

154
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:07,650
two of them or something like that. Um,

155
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:14,100
all I remember, I was just like,
these guys are fucking drunks.

156
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:17,910
I mean I drink, I don't,
I don't fucking drink.

157
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:21,550
These guys had like lunacy stories.

158
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:23,260
Yeah.

159
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:28,000
Talking about like fucking bleeding out
their ass and going right to the liquor

160
00:09:28,001 --> 00:09:30,910
store and the next day, you know what
I mean? Like not eating food for Mike.

161
00:09:30,911 --> 00:09:32,170
Just crazy.

162
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:33,563
Yeah.

163
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:38,310
Crazy, crazy fucking stories. So I
just was sitting there going, I am

164
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:39,643
okay.

165
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:43,500
I'm just a drunk. These
people got a fucking problem.

166
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:47,010
I'm telling you right now, if you
ever just want to see, you know,

167
00:09:47,011 --> 00:09:49,980
some of the most fucked up people on
the planet, just go to an AA meeting.

168
00:09:49,981 --> 00:09:53,460
These fucking people, man. You know,

169
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:57,570
if fingers are like stuck together
from like cigarette smoke,

170
00:09:57,571 --> 00:10:01,260
you know what I mean? They got
like, they just, you know, I can be,

171
00:10:01,261 --> 00:10:04,020
I'm just being an asshole. I have no
idea what a fucking AA meetings like.

172
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:09,490
And it looks like you get like a little
trinket if you'd do it for awhile,

173
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:12,100
you know, get six days, you know,

174
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:17,920
he Shah flagging, you know,
you know, addictive people.

175
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:20,800
They're, they're fucking, they can never
stop talking about themselves. Right.

176
00:10:20,801 --> 00:10:22,380
So I think it's got to
go up there. Oh my God,

177
00:10:22,381 --> 00:10:24,130
I'm gonna get so much shit
for this. I don't give a fuck.

178
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:27,760
I think it's about time. Somebody
fucking put a in its place, right?

179
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,940
Once you grow up in white
knuckle it, like the rest of us,

180
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:38,830
you've got to go join a fucking group
and everybody sits down and fucking makes

181
00:10:38,831 --> 00:10:41,490
an Afghan together. Um, you know,

182
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:43,300
it's funny that I actually
would love to be part of a group

183
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:47,140
when I went golfing up the,
this past week, you know,

184
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:51,450
and I went with a buddy of mine and he
was like a member of a country club and

185
00:10:51,451 --> 00:10:55,590
like, this is fucking cool.
It's really cool. You know,

186
00:10:57,550 --> 00:11:00,820
bunch of guys could fucking
talk shit, having a great time.

187
00:11:00,821 --> 00:11:02,770
All that shit that everybody fucking

188
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:09,550
gives you a rough time for, you know,
they always make fun of guys hanging out.

189
00:11:09,551 --> 00:11:11,370
Now if they all hang out
together like they do,

190
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:14,620
there has to be like mocked for
some fucking reason. It's fun.

191
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:18,700
You just sit around
breaking each other's balls.

192
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:22,110
That's all it was. I
went there and it was,

193
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:27,060
everybody was fucking cool and everybody
was just busting chops the whole

194
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:27,894
fucking time.

195
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:31,110
And then you go out and
golf and everybody's just
giving each other shit and

196
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:34,710
you're laughing and you smoking cigars
and you're gambling and shit. It's,

197
00:11:34,711 --> 00:11:39,090
it's fun for whatever fucking reason.
I don't know if he, if you do that now,

198
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:45,440
I don't know for some reason
that that's attacked. You know,

199
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:46,970
I don't, I don't know what
the, I don't know what it is.

200
00:11:46,971 --> 00:11:48,950
I don't know what the fuck
is you supposed to be doing,

201
00:11:48,951 --> 00:11:53,740
but I can tell you I did enjoy it.
Um, and speaking of enjoying shit,

202
00:11:53,741 --> 00:11:54,820
I know I'm all over the map.

203
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:57,813
Um,

204
00:11:58,330 --> 00:12:00,370
I found I got caught up with the last,

205
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:03,910
do you know today's Formula One
race and uh, the previous one,

206
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:07,510
like a week ago or two weeks ago,
I missed it and I have to tell you,

207
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:12,600
I loved the force India team before I
watched the previous race and now I,

208
00:12:16,111 --> 00:12:20,890
I will fucking love that team forever.
I will love that fucking team forever.

209
00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:22,330
It at the very least,

210
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:29,770
Esteban O'Connor and Sergio
Perez, everybody else was fucking,

211
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:34,930
was racing to not lose, you
know, didn't want to fuck up.

212
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:37,930
These fucking guys went in
there. You know what I mean?

213
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:41,800
You ever watch a hockey fight
and the guys is so good at it.

214
00:12:41,801 --> 00:12:45,280
They barely even punch each other.
The best ones is where you just,

215
00:12:45,281 --> 00:12:47,290
you grabbed my shoulder,
I grabbed your shoulder.

216
00:12:47,291 --> 00:12:49,450
We just fucking beat the shit
out of each other. You know,

217
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:54,400
that's what these guys did. They went
old time hockey with like racing.

218
00:12:54,970 --> 00:12:58,210
They're on the same team. They
slammed into each other twice.

219
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:02,920
They don't even give a
fuck that it's a teammate.

220
00:13:02,921 --> 00:13:06,880
This was like some sort of bloodsport
that they were doing everybody else's out

221
00:13:06,881 --> 00:13:09,250
there. Like, oh my God,
that's my teammate. I need to,

222
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:13,120
I'm really literally making fun of the
other teams for actually doing the smart

223
00:13:13,121 --> 00:13:14,860
thing. I love that they did it.

224
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:20,230
I love last year when Hamilton
and a fucking a Nicki Minaj,

225
00:13:20,231 --> 00:13:22,450
whatever his fucking name was, I
can't remember this fucking name.

226
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:23,373
What the hell's guy's name.

227
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:25,500
Okay,

228
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,780
Nikki, I want it now. I'm
taking my toys and going home.

229
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:34,020
I'm getting married now. Rosberg right,

230
00:13:34,021 --> 00:13:36,750
Nico Rosberg that's what it was
when they slammed into each other.

231
00:13:36,751 --> 00:13:38,450
They did that a couple
of times. I liked that.

232
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:40,680
And I love how these fucking drivers,

233
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:44,220
there's all of these shit where they
don't like each other. This, you know,

234
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:48,450
like Sebastian Vettel
doesn't like Lewis Hamilton.

235
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:53,700
Kimi Raikkonen doesn't
like Valtteri Botox. It's,

236
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:58,710
it literally is fucking days a
thunder. It's tremendous. And a,

237
00:13:58,711 --> 00:14:03,460
this past week's race was
great. Uh, yesterday as far
as watching a lance straw,

238
00:14:03,461 --> 00:14:05,850
getting, uh, 18 years old.

239
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:09,960
These lined up in the front
row next to Lewis Hamilton,

240
00:14:09,961 --> 00:14:13,770
who's just the fucking greatest
driver. He just is. He is.

241
00:14:13,771 --> 00:14:16,710
I know Mercedes has the best fucking
cars right now, but you know,

242
00:14:16,711 --> 00:14:19,650
give me a fucking break. It's not like
Ferrari's and he's sort of a slouch.

243
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:25,470
Right? I Dunno. You could argue
that Daniel Ricardo's just as good.

244
00:14:25,471 --> 00:14:28,530
He's just not riding. Driving a car was
good. Maybe that's what the fuck it is.

245
00:14:28,531 --> 00:14:29,251
I don't know what it is,

246
00:14:29,251 --> 00:14:33,090
but I really enjoyed yesterday's
race and the previous one. Um,

247
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:37,920
how do you not love force India
out there with the pink cars?

248
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:40,620
The few Chicago slamming into each other.

249
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:44,190
It looked like me and my
brother had a fucking carnival

250
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:49,020
that we'd be like, those two guys are
related. Like you would know. We would,

251
00:14:49,021 --> 00:14:51,980
if we got into bumper cars, we
would, no, I didn't give a fuck

252
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:55,580
about anybody else out there other
than slamming into my own fucking

253
00:14:57,260 --> 00:15:01,040
family member. What was the
point of hitting somebody else?

254
00:15:01,041 --> 00:15:05,180
I couldn't laugh at them in the car
ride home. I'd never see him again. Um,

255
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:08,900
so anyways, I guess they go to
Singapore next one of these years.

256
00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:12,200
I'm going to line up a stand up
date with that race over there. Um,

257
00:15:12,770 --> 00:15:15,710
I'm going to try and go to a couple
a year cause I'm a fucking lunatic.

258
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:20,510
So I went to Montreal this year and I'm
also going to the race in, um, Austin,

259
00:15:20,511 --> 00:15:24,800
Texas, um, provided
there's not another, uh,

260
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:31,010
you know, fucking hurricane like that
one that hit Houston. Jesus Christ.

261
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:36,920
Um, anyways, I actually, you know,

262
00:15:36,921 --> 00:15:38,960
I want to show to tweet
out something you guys,

263
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:41,990
there was actually something we could
send like fucking diapers and that type of

264
00:15:41,991 --> 00:15:42,711
stuff for our kids.

265
00:15:42,711 --> 00:15:45,230
Can't imagine it about that as babies
and everything you got to take care of.

266
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:50,780
Um, that seemed like a really
cool thing to do. The very least.

267
00:15:50,781 --> 00:15:53,000
At least you could fucking
dope. So, uh, anyways,

268
00:15:53,001 --> 00:15:57,980
I'm behind with my MotoGP racing.
I gotta get caught up on that. Um,

269
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:00,140
but I have to be, I
have to be honest, this,

270
00:16:00,141 --> 00:16:05,141
this race in Italy was one of my favorite
races just because of what was going

271
00:16:05,271 --> 00:16:09,840
on in like position four, five, and
six fucking lunatic racing. And, uh,

272
00:16:09,841 --> 00:16:13,130
I just wish they could somehow
do something to the cars that,

273
00:16:13,131 --> 00:16:17,480
that happened in the first and
second position because once again,

274
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:20,330
Lewis Hamilton, you know,

275
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:24,260
he gets to the first corner first he comes
out in first place and then that's it

276
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:26,420
. He's in the front of the race
for the rest of the fucking race.

277
00:16:26,421 --> 00:16:29,780
And then that's just it. It's
over. He's driving in clean air.

278
00:16:29,781 --> 00:16:31,130
His car's too fucking fast.

279
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:34,220
Now you've got to hope that the
car breaks down or he fucks up,

280
00:16:34,221 --> 00:16:38,990
which isn't going to happen. And, um,
but I did enjoy all that other stuff.

281
00:16:38,991 --> 00:16:41,930
But uh, congratulations to Lewis
Hamilton for winning another one.

282
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:47,030
He now is the head of Sebastian Vettel
and I believe the Mercedes team as a team

283
00:16:47,031 --> 00:16:50,930
is ahead of everybody else too. So
they're fucking crushing it. And a,

284
00:16:50,931 --> 00:16:52,400
I think it's going to be
all downhill from here.

285
00:16:52,401 --> 00:16:54,730
So I'm hoping the fucking
Ferrari team, cause they,

286
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:59,150
the closest ones can step it up. And a,
I like both those guys. I like Kimmy,

287
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:05,070
Kimmy Raycon now he seems fucking pissed
off getting penalties and shit. Um,

288
00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:08,300
I relate to the angry guys.
That's why I like force India.

289
00:17:08,330 --> 00:17:12,200
They're going to fucking slam
into each other. It's tremendous.

290
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:16,280
It's tremendous. You know,
it's childish. It's stupid.

291
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:19,730
I love when that guy who the
former race car fucking champion,

292
00:17:19,731 --> 00:17:24,110
I don't know what his name is. The
commentary just goes, Oh da boys boys.

293
00:17:24,111 --> 00:17:27,590
What are you doing a buy baby? Every
gets all like fucking parental with them.

294
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:34,520
I wanted to see, I watched the
qualifying to, I love when it rains out

295
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:36,561
to all,

296
00:17:36,561 --> 00:17:39,950
I forgot the greatest quote I've heard
since I started watching formula racing

297
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:44,150
after the fucking four Sindia
cars hit for the second time.

298
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:48,770
I think it was that old card
guy. He, she says over his radio,

299
00:17:48,771 --> 00:17:50,520
he goes to his fucking

300
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:55,260
crew chief for whatever. He
goes, what the fuck? Seriously,

301
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:58,710
what the fuck? Like flipping and meanwhile
he's going like 180 miles an hour.

302
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:06,300
He sounds like me when I drive to work
and he's doing like, you know, 180,

303
00:18:06,301 --> 00:18:10,290
200 miles an hour and he's, they fucking
flip each other off. They never flip.

304
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:12,100
He jets, you know, the
European and shit, they,

305
00:18:12,101 --> 00:18:14,370
they give the a little
blue with the fucking hand.

306
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:17,460
Somebody's got to flip somebody
off. You know what I mean?

307
00:18:17,461 --> 00:18:20,280
Or if they write on their ass, slam on
the brakes like you do on the highway.

308
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:25,830
Stop fucking tailgating. I wasn't
tailgating. I was drafting. All right,

309
00:18:25,831 --> 00:18:28,080
enough of this shit. I know a lot of
you guys don't even watch this shit,

310
00:18:28,081 --> 00:18:32,820
but I'm all right, let's
plow ahead here. I, uh,

311
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:38,490
I was, um, did it casino, I
already forget the name of it.

312
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:42,090
Um, I was in a casino, uh,

313
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:49,550
right outside of San Diego and I did it
two years ago and I flew down in our 44

314
00:18:50,701 --> 00:18:54,210
and today, oh, yesterday I flew in a, uh,

315
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:58,230
I don't even know what the fuck
it was to be honest with Ya.

316
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:01,850
Let me see if I can look up
the name of this helicopter.

317
00:19:01,851 --> 00:19:06,550
This helicopter was turbine engine,
which is a jet engine. And uh,

318
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:08,750
it was fucking on. The
whole thing was hydraulic.

319
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,930
I fucking gives a fuck
with what helicopter was.

320
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:14,350
So basically I trained on the [inaudible].

321
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:17,540
Our 22 is like driving a car
that has drum berry, drum brakes,

322
00:19:17,541 --> 00:19:19,850
no power steering. You know what I mean?

323
00:19:19,851 --> 00:19:22,730
And you have to like fucking control
the wipers yourself. You know,

324
00:19:22,731 --> 00:19:26,300
like the 1920s, like Laurel and hardy,
you got to like move it side to side.

325
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:31,010
Um, which is also why I love that
thing because you're really flying.

326
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:35,090
If you hold in a hover your fucking
doing it, then you move up to the RF 44.

327
00:19:35,091 --> 00:19:39,050
And this is kind of weird
where it's like the, uh,

328
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,880
the collective and the cyclic
of both hydraulic. Okay.

329
00:19:44,881 --> 00:19:48,450
That's your power and then how you
steer the shit you hold with your hands

330
00:19:48,451 --> 00:19:52,670
basically. And then if for whatever
reason your foot pedals are,

331
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:56,240
are not hydraulic, they just
manually your own precious.

332
00:19:56,241 --> 00:19:58,560
So you're dealing with
like really finessing it,

333
00:19:58,561 --> 00:20:02,040
barely having to touch it up top and
then your drum breaks down the bottom.

334
00:20:02,041 --> 00:20:05,250
It's just, it's a very odd feeling.

335
00:20:05,251 --> 00:20:08,320
And I fly out of Burbank
and there's always a fucking
tailwind when you're going

336
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:12,810
into set it down. It's so
fucking annoying. Like right
behind you. Full blast.

337
00:20:12,811 --> 00:20:15,870
I don't know where it comes from. Um,

338
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:20,250
every time. In fact, I saw this
student that was learning over there.

339
00:20:20,251 --> 00:20:23,970
What he would do once he, when he
would go to set it down, he would just,

340
00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:27,450
he would just face the wind and set
it down and then go inside and get the

341
00:20:27,451 --> 00:20:30,510
wheels and then put 'em on the thing and
then just turn the helicopter around.

342
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:37,380
As much as it was funny, I was
like, that's a great fucking idea.

343
00:20:37,381 --> 00:20:41,670
I would rather do that, you know, cause
you're landed next to other helicopters.

344
00:20:41,671 --> 00:20:44,490
I don't want to fuck anybody else's shit
up. Sweaty was this thing was like a,

345
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:50,290
was like a six and a, I've
got a picture, you know,

346
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:54,230
Dean del Ray, go look him up on Twitter.
He's teed, tweeted out a picture,

347
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:57,020
I'll fucking, I'll retweet it.
And it's like, the word is,

348
00:20:57,021 --> 00:20:59,710
I'm standing in front of the
coolest helicopter I ever flew in.

349
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:03,500
I'm talking when somebody, whoever took
the picture. So I looked like a fucking,

350
00:21:03,501 --> 00:21:06,840
I may look like an asshole
anyways. Whose kid? No. Um,

351
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:08,693
but it was,

352
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:13,260
I would say the most
amazing machine I've ever

353
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:17,760
gotten the chance to
operate. And it was like,

354
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:22,110
it was like a sports car in the
air with like, like the tightest,

355
00:21:22,111 --> 00:21:27,090
most responsive fucking suspension you
could possibly think of without the rough

356
00:21:27,091 --> 00:21:30,090
ride because you're not on the ground,
you just go in through the air.

357
00:21:30,090 --> 00:21:34,100
It didn't feel any turbulence
whatsoever. And um,

358
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:39,630
I just know when you take off in the
year 22 and you push the stick forward,

359
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:44,910
right? I mean, I don't know how
long it is. It's a good eight,

360
00:21:44,911 --> 00:21:49,450
nine seconds until you want to get
up to 53 knots. That's the optimal,

361
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:50,313
you know,

362
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:55,700
speed to get out to get the most rate
of climb and it takes you a good,

363
00:21:55,701 --> 00:21:58,970
I feels like forever eight, nine
seconds, this fucking thing.

364
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:04,000
It was like maybe two and a half
seconds and it was up to speed.

365
00:22:04,191 --> 00:22:06,800
You just pulled the stick back and
you fucking shot up in the air.

366
00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:11,700
I've never been, it was really
intimidating. But once I just sort of,

367
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:13,950
I watched my instructor
and I've two times do that,

368
00:22:13,951 --> 00:22:17,550
the start and startup and shutdown of it
and it's like, it's, it's not that bad.

369
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:22,530
It's just intimidating at first. And then
you get, once you know where to look,

370
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:24,960
which is basically your manifold pressure,

371
00:22:24,961 --> 00:22:26,910
your altitude and how fast you're going,

372
00:22:27,390 --> 00:22:31,230
and then also your trim once you know
where those are all the other shit.

373
00:22:31,231 --> 00:22:32,220
It's just like, well, you know,

374
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:34,980
a fucking horn is going to go off if
there's a problem anywhere else. Right.

375
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:41,840
Anyways, it was fun as shit and
went down and we did the Gig and um,

376
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:46,230
I think I'm going to start
doing that. Like, um,

377
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:51,030
I'm doing a podcast festival for the
all things comedy network in the end of

378
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:53,940
October. And if I don't get
this acting Gig and I'm in La,

379
00:22:53,941 --> 00:22:57,810
I'm going to fly out in a
helicopter. I got a Vegas Gig,

380
00:22:57,811 --> 00:23:00,540
I'm going to do that one in the
helicopter too. And that way I can get my,

381
00:23:00,541 --> 00:23:05,460
keep my hours up, stay current and
a while going out, making money.

382
00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:08,490
So I'm renting the helicopter,
but I'm earning money, right?

383
00:23:10,010 --> 00:23:13,410
And in a way I get to fly private without
having to blow all this money on a

384
00:23:13,411 --> 00:23:17,340
fucking stupid ass jet,
which is stupid, right?

385
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:23,530
Those fucking private jets is fucking
stupid as hell you in and you can't even

386
00:23:23,531 --> 00:23:26,050
stand up. It's the dumbest
thing ever. You're way better.

387
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:31,200
You could spend one 90th the money on a
first-class fucking ticket and you are

388
00:23:31,331 --> 00:23:34,810
in a a, you're on like a fucking
cruise ship. You can stand,

389
00:23:34,811 --> 00:23:36,610
you can stand up when you take a piss.

390
00:23:36,611 --> 00:23:39,970
You don't have to bend over
at the fucking neck, you know?

391
00:23:39,971 --> 00:23:42,370
I know they make bigger jets, but
those things are like, you know,

392
00:23:42,610 --> 00:23:44,920
you're going to fly from Boston to Rhode.

393
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:49,370
It's going to cost you like a fucking
$300,000. I don't know how people,

394
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:51,860
I don't know anybody flies
private to be honest with you.

395
00:23:51,861 --> 00:23:53,840
I have no fucking idea. I'm

396
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:59,000
just go to a mom and pop airport,
get on jet blue or virgin.

397
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:04,030
That's the way to do it. Use some miles,
bump yourself up to a bigger seat.

398
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:08,230
You're going to get a pilot who's psyched?
He's making a ton of fucking money.

399
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:11,260
You get on those little ones, those
[inaudible] people and I'm making shit.

400
00:24:12,330 --> 00:24:12,750
Yeah,

401
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:15,900
right. I don't know. That's been, that's
been my experience. They're trying to,

402
00:24:15,930 --> 00:24:18,570
they're trying to get a gig flying one
of the bigger ones so they can actually

403
00:24:18,571 --> 00:24:22,050
make money instead of flying
some little fucking six cedar.

404
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:23,173
Okay.

405
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:25,120
But you know what it is. I'm
out of my fucking element.

406
00:24:25,121 --> 00:24:26,320
I don't know anything about that shit.

407
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:30,490
I just have heard about how much it
fucking costs. All right, let me, uh,

408
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:34,060
let me read the, um, let
me read the fucking, uh,

409
00:24:34,061 --> 00:24:38,740
advertising here for this week. Uh,
all right, what do we got here? Oh,

410
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:41,710
draft kings. Everybody Gay. Do
you like to gamble on sports?

411
00:24:41,711 --> 00:24:44,230
You want to make some fucking
money? These are the guys.

412
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:47,920
It's not too late to get closer to the
game you love with draft kings one week

413
00:24:47,921 --> 00:24:51,130
fantasy football. This Sunday
draft kings is hosting a

414
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:58,090
$100,000 pick contest that is
totally free to enter. Alright?

415
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:01,300
Pick them as the newest way to
play. One week fantasy football.

416
00:25:01,301 --> 00:25:03,370
Drafting your team is faster than ever.

417
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:06,340
Draftkings has organized
players into eight tiers.

418
00:25:06,550 --> 00:25:09,070
All you have to do is select
one player from each tier.

419
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:11,500
Choose between public contests,

420
00:25:12,890 --> 00:25:16,940
choose between public contest with big
cash prizes or private contests where con

421
00:25:16,970 --> 00:25:20,900
private contest, sorry, where you can

of which the New England patriots,

430
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:57,790
the five times Superbowl
defending champions,

431
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:00,433
um,

432
00:26:01,930 --> 00:26:06,460
the they offer the often criticized
for absolutely no fucking reason.

433
00:26:08,170 --> 00:26:09,003
You know,

434
00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:13,230
all the time I had another guy
bring up fucking deflate gate.

435
00:26:13,290 --> 00:26:16,920
I always tell them, it's like they did
not get convicted of deflating balls.

436
00:26:16,921 --> 00:26:18,030
You fucking moron.

437
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:22,360
That was laughed at at court
for the 90 million at the time.

438
00:26:23,730 --> 00:26:26,940
And then the suspension
was, was, was canceled.

439
00:26:26,970 --> 00:26:29,850
Remember that he was supposed to be
suspended and they took it to court and it

440
00:26:29,851 --> 00:26:32,330
was laughed out of court and
the judge said, you're wasted.

441
00:26:32,331 --> 00:26:34,950
Why did you waste my fucking time
with this? That's what happened.

442
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:38,660
And then you know, the
United States of America,

443
00:26:38,661 --> 00:26:41,360
you can not get tried
twice for the same offense.

444
00:26:42,550 --> 00:26:44,460
That's a hearsay

445
00:26:44,790 --> 00:26:47,820
something or other, right? You can't be,
you can't be fucking double jeopardy.

446
00:26:47,821 --> 00:26:51,390
You can't fucking do that.
So the NFL found a loophole,

447
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:55,260
they just went back to court and
said, uh, is the NFL and corporation.

448
00:26:55,470 --> 00:26:58,140
And the judge was like,
yes. And then they said,

449
00:26:58,141 --> 00:27:01,020
does a corporation have the
right to suspend its employee?

450
00:27:01,050 --> 00:27:05,100
And the judge said yes. And they
said, fine, where corporation,

451
00:27:05,610 --> 00:27:09,060
Tom Brady is our employee and he is
suspended. And that's what they did.

452
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:10,600
Yeah.

453
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:13,090
That's why he got suspended, not
because they proved anything.

454
00:27:13,630 --> 00:27:17,380
You fucking dopes. And by the way, the
guy who caught the, the, the alleged,

455
00:27:17,410 --> 00:27:20,680
by the way, under inflated
fucking ball, by the way,

456
00:27:20,681 --> 00:27:24,190
the cults also allegedly had 200
flighty balls. But who gives a fuck?

457
00:27:24,191 --> 00:27:25,900
Then I went in all the
championships, right?

458
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:30,590
The guy who caught the ball
tested positive for steroids

00:34:08,301 --> 00:34:12,560
them. It's overwhelming. You feel like
Robin Williams and Moscow on the Hudson,

564
00:34:12,561 --> 00:34:15,890
right when he walks into the grocery
store and he fucking faints and he sticks

565
00:34:15,891 --> 00:34:20,870
his head up that girl's dress. You
remember that, um, at the store,

566
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:23,150
the too many options. You can't tell
exactly where he said that. All right.

567
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:24,650
Then if you have any questions,

568
00:34:24,790 --> 00:34:27,740
that clerk usually doesn't know the
difference and usually can't fucking find

569
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:32,120
them cause they got a skeleton crew
at nine in the morning. Now, um,

570
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:34,940
they're not implicit, not
experts on the products.

571

convenient for you to upgrade your shave

599
00:36:19,430 --> 00:36:23,410

600
00:36:23,411 --> 00:36:27,490
I'm gonna fucking kill you.

623
00:37:44,851 --> 00:37:49,350
I hop onto the table to make the table
a little more sticky. Gross. Sorry.

624
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:53,820
This is what you need to do. All the
dopes. Buy Flowers on mother's Day.

00:37:53,970 --> 00:37:58,800

birthdays and they buy them on, on,

626
00:37:58,830 --> 00:38:01,470
on fucking Valentine's Day. All right.

627
00:38:03,210 --> 00:38:04,980
If you want to up your blow jobs,

628
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:08,550
if you want to stay up in
the pros and hit 300. Okay?

629
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:11,340
You got to spray it all
over the field. All right,

630
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:15,030
so one of these times you just, you just
can't, it's August. Is it September?

631
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:18,270
Yes. Who gets their fucking wife
or girlfriend flowers in September?

632
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:22,440
Nobody be the person that fucking does
it and get your Dick sucked today.

633
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:25,650
All right, there you go. All
right. Booze lineup. Oh, beautiful.

634
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:30,570
I was hoping people gonna send
these in. All right. I um,

635
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:36,160
I talked last week on, you know, I
get back into baseball and a Yankees,

636
00:38:36,161 --> 00:38:38,590
red sox things heating up again.
We'd better meet in the playoffs.

637
00:38:38,591 --> 00:38:42,070
It's has to happen. It's
been too fucking long. Um,

638
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:44,290
I ended up fucking Yankees
took three out of four,

639
00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:49,470
so I broke even all this shit-talking
all of this fucking shit talking and it

640
00:38:49,931 --> 00:38:54,910
just, we ended up just being
even, um, but I was talking about,

641
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:58,710
you know, just watching baseball. I
did my booze lineup of like whiskeys,

642
00:38:58,711 --> 00:39:02,470
scotches, and bourbons. All right.
I don't just do scotches. Okay.

643
00:39:02,471 --> 00:39:07,180
This isn't like the fucking, this isn't
MLB when Babe Ruth played. All right,

644
00:39:07,210 --> 00:39:10,810
this is any, anybody can
show up as long as you brown.

645
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:14,970
Now Tequila is also welcome. Um,
so this would be my lineup. Uh,

646
00:39:15,070 --> 00:39:17,860
I always change the lineup.
I would say this week, uh,

647
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:21,010
Johnnie Walker blue was leading off.
You got to start with some strong shit,

648
00:39:21,011 --> 00:39:24,190
right? Pappy van Winkle is in second,

649
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:29,010
and then I would put a
angel's envy at third.

650
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:36,210
MacCallum rare cass. Rare cask
is baton cleanup. All right?

651
00:39:36,211 --> 00:39:37,500
Then I'd have Yippy Kai, Yay.

652
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:39,673
Fifth.

653
00:39:41,490 --> 00:39:44,070
And then once she gets in the middle
of this is just when I just want to get

654
00:39:44,071 --> 00:39:46,680
fucked up. Right. Those
other ones. Angels.

655
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:50,070
Entities also want a good one just
to get fucked up on, you know,

656
00:39:50,490 --> 00:39:54,030
it's not that expensive either. Then
you get to the middle of the order,

657
00:39:54,031 --> 00:39:56,310
but it's like I'm staying at home
and I'm getting drunk by myself,

658
00:39:56,311 --> 00:39:59,220
or I'm getting drunk with a friend of
mine that it appreciates good whiskey,

659
00:39:59,221 --> 00:40:02,770
bourbon or whatever. When I get in the
middle, then it's like [inaudible],

660
00:40:04,150 --> 00:40:07,140
patroned silver. Maybe I put grand
patrol where I put angel's envy.

661
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:12,360
That's why I got that. Okay. Grant
patrol it fucking the third spot.

662
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:14,190
Then I got [inaudible],

663
00:40:14,250 --> 00:40:18,660
then I got fucking angel's envy
and then Johnny Walker Black.

664
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:22,180
Okay. Those are the next three.

665
00:40:23,270 --> 00:40:25,400
So then you've got eight and
nine and that's when you know,

666
00:40:25,401 --> 00:40:26,420
you just have fucking, yeah,

667
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:30,860
just people coming over and they just
want to get shit faced and you just got to

668
00:40:30,861 --> 00:40:35,180
go maker's Mark Fucking, uh, Jack Daniels,

669
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:39,250
you know? And then if you just
have a complete fucking shit at,

670
00:40:39,370 --> 00:40:43,220
do you just give him Red Label?
Fucking Johnny Walker. All right,

671
00:40:43,490 --> 00:40:46,010
so here's this person's Booz
lineup. All right. He goes,

672
00:40:46,011 --> 00:40:49,640
I love your idea about doing a
booze alcohol battling lineup.

673
00:40:49,641 --> 00:40:54,440
Here's my submission leading off
Kentucky Tavern. I'd never heard of this.

674
00:40:54,441 --> 00:40:58,160
This is what I love. It's going to
give me new shit to try. Dependable,

675
00:40:58,430 --> 00:40:59,900
a little rough around the edges,

676
00:40:59,901 --> 00:41:03,950
but you know this guy's going to get
on base at a 400 clip even if he has to

677
00:41:03,951 --> 00:41:05,600
lean into one every now and then.

678
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:09,380
I love that this person broke it all down
and give me a scouting reports to when

679
00:41:09,381 --> 00:41:14,330
you send these in [inaudible] second
core nitos. What the fuck is that?

680
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:18,260
Juanito's a can be streaky at times,

681
00:41:18,410 --> 00:41:22,840
but still has a little bit of a pop if
you mix it with grapefruits. Soda, Dude,

682
00:41:23,030 --> 00:41:25,370
Jersey and your second guy, you're
already mixing it with something.

683
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:27,490
Okay.

684
00:41:27,490 --> 00:41:29,420
Alright. Oh Shit. Hang on
a second. Speaking of that,

685
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:35,000
some Josh just asked me if
I had soda. No, I don't.

686
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:37,010
I got to do a voice text here.

687
00:41:39,250 --> 00:41:44,250
Get the Phanta orange
with the Mexican sugar.

688
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:49,480
There you go. All right.

689
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:50,470
Okay.

690
00:41:50,470 --> 00:41:54,910
That's right. When I'm fucking not booze
and I actually drink Fanta Orange Soda.

691
00:41:55,210 --> 00:41:58,450
It's kind of nice cause it's really sweet.
And then you got the smoke. You know,

692
00:41:58,451 --> 00:41:59,320
it's not redundant.

693
00:41:59,570 --> 00:42:02,950
Remember big night when that lady got the
pasta and then she also ordered mashed

694
00:42:02,951 --> 00:42:06,700
potatoes and the guy wouldn't do it
cause it was two starches. You know,

695
00:42:06,790 --> 00:42:09,040
why would you have a cigar and
then drink something really PD.

696
00:42:09,041 --> 00:42:13,600
It's like fucking redundant. You want
some, a sweet kind of alcohol, um,

697
00:42:15,770 --> 00:42:19,550
fucking with you. I'm not actually,
I do. Okay. So batting third,

698
00:42:19,551 --> 00:42:22,760
this guy has bullet. This
is your franchise player.

699
00:42:22,761 --> 00:42:24,560
He makes everyone around
him a little better.

700
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,540
Plus he's going to give
you a team friendly,

701
00:42:26,541 --> 00:42:30,260
longterm contract that won't
have you paying luxury taxes.

702
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:34,040
Do this guy's great. You know, we took
a funny idea. Now he's taken it to,

703
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:36,640
he didn't even funnier
level. All I did was just,

704
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:41,240
I got to break down each player now.
All right. Batting Cleanup Knob Creek.

705
00:42:41,690 --> 00:42:44,990
He goes, can you tell I'm a bourbon
drinker. I can never keep them straight.

706
00:42:45,350 --> 00:42:48,980
Egos. Bottom line is if there's
any ducks left on the pond,

707
00:42:48,981 --> 00:42:51,590
this guy is there to deliver
it. And the knockout punch.

708
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:54,380
I gotta tell you the way
he's describing this lineup,

709
00:42:54,381 --> 00:42:57,080
he's definitely making the playoffs.
If not fucking winning the pennant.

710
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:03,160
I'm batting fifth Smirnoff vodka. Okay?

711
00:43:03,161 --> 00:43:04,930
Definitely nothing to write home about,

712
00:43:05,230 --> 00:43:07,330
but when surrounded with
the right personnel,

713
00:43:07,331 --> 00:43:11,620
there's always potential for magic. You
know what my vodka is? My goto vodka.

714
00:43:11,621 --> 00:43:14,570
I like Belvedere. Oh,
Belvedere, come here, boy.

715
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:18,280
I like that better than grey
goose. Grey goose is just like,

716
00:43:18,310 --> 00:43:22,210
that's like soft rock, like easy
listening. You know what I mean?

717
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:24,460
I like Belvedere. It's got a little
more of a fucking bite to it,

718
00:43:24,461 --> 00:43:29,200
but I don't know much about vodka is
either a batting six Johnny Walker black.

719
00:43:29,980 --> 00:43:32,640
Now you might be now. Might
be a good time dimension.

720
00:43:32,730 --> 00:43:37,730
I'm in my early thirties thank goodness
this guy is a September call up.

721
00:43:38,170 --> 00:43:41,530
You're not quite ready to add them
to your 40 man roster just yet.

722
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:43,353
Buddies for a cup of,

723
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:46,600
but he's up for a cup of coffee because
you know he's going to be an important

724
00:43:46,601 --> 00:43:49,480
part of your future. Yeah. Maybe you
can get on base and steal second.

725
00:43:49,910 --> 00:43:54,160
All right. Batting seventh. Oh
Jesus do this is unforgivable.

726
00:43:54,161 --> 00:43:55,150
If you're in your thirties,

727
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:59,410
this is unforgivable and I respect you
that you can still drink this Yeager

728
00:43:59,411 --> 00:44:02,950
meister. Wow. Wow.

729
00:44:02,980 --> 00:44:07,570
You often find yourself wondering why
this guy is even still around and yet you

730
00:44:07,571 --> 00:44:11,170
feel you can Burma you
wait and yet you can,

731
00:44:11,260 --> 00:44:15,640
you feel like you can remember a time
when he was actually pretty good. Yeah.

732
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:20,600
He's like the fucking, uh, one
of those guys. We had just like,

733
00:44:20,601 --> 00:44:23,130
you know, like Vince Carter still plan.

734
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:26,510
It's not fair to Vince Carter because
Vince Carter was one of the greatest

735
00:44:26,511 --> 00:44:31,040
fucking, you know, I think the
best dunker of all fucking time.

736
00:44:31,730 --> 00:44:33,780
High of certainly the
highest jumper. I Apologize,

737
00:44:33,781 --> 00:44:36,930
I shouldn't have said Vince Carter was
the first guy I thought of. He is like a,

738
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:40,680
uh, uh, up. Do you have moon?

739
00:44:40,780 --> 00:44:44,490
Do you ever one like Giobbie was
playing on the Colorado Rockies.

740
00:44:44,550 --> 00:44:49,440
It's like one of those deals. All
right. Captain Morgan Batting Eighth,

741
00:44:49,710 --> 00:44:53,100
definitely a role player. This,
this I, that's like your catcher.

742
00:44:53,580 --> 00:44:55,080
This guy could be a superstar,

743
00:44:55,081 --> 00:44:58,110
but he's got a bit of a sweet tooth
and always shows up to spring training,

744
00:44:58,111 --> 00:45:01,500
20 pounds overweight. Now he's
the panda still. You know,

745
00:45:01,501 --> 00:45:04,950
he's good for a sac flying
a key situation. Yeah. One
of these guys just has to,

746
00:45:04,951 --> 00:45:08,370
you're out there for defense, you know,
he's not hitting for average. Alright.

747
00:45:08,430 --> 00:45:12,090
Batting ninth, wild
Turkey, American honey,

748
00:45:13,050 --> 00:45:15,090
and he writes old ggs a,

749
00:45:15,091 --> 00:45:18,450
you ask him to lay down a bunt and you
just know he's going to hit into an

750
00:45:18,451 --> 00:45:22,650
inning ending double play every
damn time. Uh, by the way, if it's,

751
00:45:22,980 --> 00:45:24,030
if it's a close one,

752
00:45:24,031 --> 00:45:28,830
I'm putting in buffalo trace in place
of Jaeger as a defensive substitution

753
00:45:28,831 --> 00:45:32,430
through this guy's brilliant. So
that's my lineup. Thanks for the idea.

754
00:45:32,431 --> 00:45:35,130
I enjoyed putting this together.
Even if you don't read it now, Dude,

755
00:45:35,131 --> 00:45:38,430
I love that you broke it all down. All
right, here's another guy's lineup.

756
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:42,360
All right. His whiskey
lineup. Bullet, Eagle,

757
00:45:42,361 --> 00:45:47,361
rare batting third macallan 12
batting fourth angel's envy,

758
00:45:47,761 --> 00:45:50,820
cask strength. I never had that.

759
00:45:50,821 --> 00:45:55,480
D h a I might fuck up some
of the names of these. Uh,

760
00:45:56,110 --> 00:45:59,810
Bell Bell. Vinny, 12 years, single malt.

761
00:46:00,290 --> 00:46:04,820
Glen Levitt, French Oak. I can't deal
with the florals. I don't like the floors.

762
00:46:04,821 --> 00:46:07,100
I like more that PD thing.
Like the Glen Levitz.

763
00:46:07,220 --> 00:46:11,240
I'd never been able to a quite
handle this, but I, I respect them.

764
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:16,070
They are definitely in the
hall of fame of booze. Um,

765
00:46:19,050 --> 00:46:24,020
oh fuck. He's going to stop by a Taco. Oh,

766
00:46:24,021 --> 00:46:26,300
Jesus Christ. What is he
talking about? No, fuck.

767
00:46:26,301 --> 00:46:30,180
He's gonna stop by Taco truck to get the
fucking booze. No, no, no, no, no, no.

768
00:46:30,260 --> 00:46:33,830
The soda I made. Hang on, let me
hit pause and straighten this up.

769
00:46:35,710 --> 00:46:39,520
All right, I'm back. So anyways,
uh, Glen Levitt, French oak,

770
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:44,560
six number seven, Willie pots. Still
Reserve. Never heard of that one.

771
00:46:44,561 --> 00:46:49,240
Number eight, Jefferson's
ocean aged at. See Jesus.

772
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:51,760
Sounds like low tide
shit to me. Number nine,

773
00:46:51,761 --> 00:46:55,420
Hudson Bay starting pitcher is blends.

774
00:46:55,421 --> 00:46:59,620
I've got to do a starting
pitcher. Middle Reliever, uh,

775
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:03,850
giving you a re a reliable
couple innings makers.

776
00:47:03,851 --> 00:47:08,530
46 closer is Alijah
Craig barrel proof. Dude,

777
00:47:08,531 --> 00:47:10,720
I love everybody going
with the starting pitchers.

778
00:47:11,860 --> 00:47:13,920
Then you got to have your
middle Raliegh. Eylea yeah,

779
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:17,860
actually actually had middle relief. Oh
my God, Dude. This is, this is endless.

780
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:20,140
And then you don't see, you're
gonna get some real big time.

781
00:47:20,470 --> 00:47:24,140
Booz hounds that nine, you know,
positions in the batting lineup,

782
00:47:24,250 --> 00:47:26,800
but not going to be enough. They're
going to have to go thick enough to like,

783
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:32,470
I dunno, do like a a football
team. 11 offensive players.

784
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:35,020
This isn't fair to people
over in Europe. Go ahead,

785
00:47:35,021 --> 00:47:38,800
give me your fucking lineups and use
all the fucking soccer terminology.

786
00:47:38,801 --> 00:47:42,760
Maybe I'll learn something. All right
is another not last booze line up here.

787
00:47:43,750 --> 00:47:45,880
Dear Billy, no fun. No fuss, no Muss,

788
00:47:45,881 --> 00:47:49,780
no brainer in answer to your requests
for our batting lineups of booze.

789
00:47:49,781 --> 00:47:51,220
I'm not much of a drinker anymore,

790
00:47:51,221 --> 00:47:55,270
so I'll go the other way and
do my recreational drug lineup.

791
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:59,650
I love it. I love it. You guys have
taken this idea and running with it.

792
00:47:59,651 --> 00:48:02,110
This is tremendous. All right. Number one,

793
00:48:02,111 --> 00:48:05,830
weed number two, black hash,

794
00:48:06,100 --> 00:48:10,570
preferably from Nepal. Number
three, magic mushrooms.

795
00:48:10,810 --> 00:48:14,650
Batting cleanup, LSD, preferably purple.

796
00:48:14,651 --> 00:48:18,280
Owsley never tried it, but
according to Ken Casey,

797
00:48:18,490 --> 00:48:22,540
it was the best number five,
ecstasy, pure and uncut.

798
00:48:23,210 --> 00:48:27,220
Number six, ketamine. I don't
want this number seven, cocaine,

799
00:48:27,221 --> 00:48:30,970
pure and uncut cocaine. Pure on
up unconscious should be fucking,

800
00:48:31,930 --> 00:48:35,590
that sounds like a speedster, man. Get
him on base. He fucking still second.

801
00:48:36,590 --> 00:48:39,490
You have LSD. Fucking bring them
home with a single door, right?

802
00:48:41,380 --> 00:48:44,200
I don't know. Running on a full count.
You're not going to catch that guy.

803
00:48:44,201 --> 00:48:46,900
He might score from first.
All right, number eight,

804
00:48:47,340 --> 00:48:51,940
peyote pot number nine,
masculine, pure and uncut.

805
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:56,500
Hey Bill, on Thursday you were talking
about the sound of drums in the 70s.

806
00:48:56,501 --> 00:49:00,100
I watched this recently and thought
it would be informative to you over

807
00:49:00,101 --> 00:49:04,690
overhead, Mike with a compressor on
it. Um, you guys have to watch this.

808
00:49:04,691 --> 00:49:05,140
If you're in, are there

809
00:49:05,140 --> 00:49:07,820
any type of music? I actually
watched this thing and it's,

810
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:12,290
do you know that sound
of a Phil Collins Drums,

811
00:49:12,291 --> 00:49:17,120
the famous drum fill from in the air
tonight that Gaga go, go, go, go good.

812
00:49:17,121 --> 00:49:20,300
Don't, don't dumb. And it was,
you got to watch this video,

813
00:49:20,301 --> 00:49:24,770
how they came up with that drum sound was
an accident and then everybody used it

814
00:49:24,771 --> 00:49:27,950
and it literally became the sound
of the 80s. And now it's back.

815
00:49:28,460 --> 00:49:31,820
I guess Taylor swift used it in
some song called 1989 and all that.

816
00:49:31,821 --> 00:49:36,410
But if you just, if you're
into that nerdy audio stuff,

817
00:49:37,220 --> 00:49:41,480
like I found this out great. My
fucking drum teacher, Davy Lich is,

818
00:49:42,350 --> 00:49:45,800
I was tuning up my drums, you know,

819
00:49:45,801 --> 00:49:50,801
I got some back east and says old
Slingerland kit and it's a a third,

820
00:49:51,380 --> 00:49:56,270
a 12. Wait, no, a nine
by 13, 14, and an 18.

821
00:49:56,271 --> 00:49:57,440
It was 13, 14,

822
00:49:57,980 --> 00:50:01,370
Tom's and then an 18 inch
floor and a 24 inch kick.

823
00:50:01,670 --> 00:50:05,390
And I ended up adding another, I've
found a, uh, from the same era,

824
00:50:05,810 --> 00:50:09,140
a 16 inch floor Tom. And then
I added another base drum.

825
00:50:09,650 --> 00:50:14,000
So I got to 20 fours. All right.
This is my first attempt to get,

826
00:50:14,001 --> 00:50:18,920
to try and get away from just aping and
doing a bad job of everything John Bonam

827
00:50:18,921 --> 00:50:23,510
did. I was getting into
Primus and my, my brothers,

828
00:50:23,511 --> 00:50:26,140
they were playing like speed metal and
shit and they would try and I always try

829
00:50:26,210 --> 00:50:28,580
to get me into Metallica,
slayer and all them and I just,

830
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:32,000
I just was too much of a fucking idiot
to realize how great that music was.

831
00:50:32,300 --> 00:50:35,150
And I could have seen all those bands
on their first tours and I didn't do it.

832
00:50:36,370 --> 00:50:38,080
Um, so anyways, uh,

833
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:42,820
I went home and I was tuning
up the bass drum and um,

834
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:49,560
I just couldn't get a good fucking sound
and it was this weird like vibrating

835
00:50:49,691 --> 00:50:51,250
fucking sound or whatever.

836
00:50:52,390 --> 00:50:55,660
And I text my teacher, I said, yeah,

837
00:50:55,661 --> 00:50:58,210
I'm getting this weird like
a buzzer rat on. He said,

838
00:50:58,211 --> 00:51:01,840
is there a hole in the
front head? I was like,

839
00:51:01,841 --> 00:51:03,280
this guy's a fucking genius.

840
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:07,270
Could genius because what happened is
there wasn't a hole in the front head,

841
00:51:07,660 --> 00:51:11,200
but where they were or something fell
on it and puncture just a little list of

842
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:13,600
hole. I said it was a
tiny little, it goes,

843
00:51:13,601 --> 00:51:18,240
that would be enough to fuck it up cause
I couldn't get that boom sound. And,

844
00:51:18,730 --> 00:51:21,240
um, so now I'm like obsessing
about it. I gotta get,

845
00:51:21,330 --> 00:51:25,710
I gotta get back east again. I want
to try tuning them up again. And um,

846
00:51:25,770 --> 00:51:30,770
I've now become obsessed
with like different heads
and I used to be so afraid to

847
00:51:30,991 --> 00:51:32,100
try and tune my drums.

848
00:51:32,101 --> 00:51:34,410
I'd have somebody else do it and
then I just wouldn't touch them.

849
00:51:34,650 --> 00:51:36,300
And I play them until they sucked again.

850
00:51:36,301 --> 00:51:39,930
And then I hope I could find somebody
else rather than just biting the bullet

851
00:51:39,931 --> 00:51:40,411
and being like,

852
00:51:40,411 --> 00:51:44,010
just take out your drum key and start
fucking with it and ask people who know

853
00:51:44,011 --> 00:51:47,670
how to do it, to teach you how to do it
and keep fucking doing it. You asshole.

854
00:51:48,940 --> 00:51:52,380
But you know, part of me, I mean, an
asshole is you don't do shit like that.

855
00:51:53,950 --> 00:51:58,590
All right. Apocalypse.
Hey there, dilly dilly.

856
00:51:58,591 --> 00:52:01,150
Hey there, Billy death bell. Uh,

857
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:05,570
the Internet keeps talking about the
end of times as if things today are far

858
00:52:05,571 --> 00:52:08,450
worse than they've ever
been. I'm only 31 years old,

859
00:52:08,451 --> 00:52:12,350
but I seem to remember plenty of
bad weather and shitty presidents.

860
00:52:13,940 --> 00:52:14,773
Um,

861
00:52:15,740 --> 00:52:20,150
there's this need to make everything
sound worse than it is these days because

862
00:52:20,151 --> 00:52:24,380
everyone loves to be the bearer of
bad news and they get a thrill off the

863
00:52:24,381 --> 00:52:28,130
excitement that shit may
be going south real quick.

864
00:52:28,340 --> 00:52:33,170
I saw a quote by John Mayer on Twitter.
Someone asked him what annoys him?

865
00:52:33,171 --> 00:52:36,980
And he says, spacious argument.

866
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:41,900
It's everywhere. I can't stand
it. Is that, as I say that right?

867
00:52:42,860 --> 00:52:43,730
The Fed has a,

868
00:52:43,790 --> 00:52:48,790
the fetishization of defense
attorney logic gone mainstream.

869
00:52:50,060 --> 00:52:51,440
Ugh. Well,

870
00:52:51,441 --> 00:52:54,020
he's obviously a smarter person than me
because I don't want any of that means

871
00:52:54,980 --> 00:52:56,780
spacious argument. It's everywhere.

872
00:52:56,781 --> 00:53:00,800
I can't stand at the fetishization of
defense attorney logic gone mainstream.

873
00:53:04,940 --> 00:53:07,340
That right there is why he's a brilliant
guitars cause I don't know what the

874
00:53:07,341 --> 00:53:08,540
fuck he just did, but I don't,

875
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:10,880
I don't know that anybody's ever
put words together like that.

876
00:53:11,780 --> 00:53:13,820
I don't know what that
means. Uh, I totally agree.

877
00:53:13,821 --> 00:53:17,060
Everyone thinks they're dropping the mic
and they're just pandering and reaching

878
00:53:17,061 --> 00:53:19,670
for low hanging fruit. Now
that I agree with. Yes.

879
00:53:19,730 --> 00:53:24,320
A P s keep the 90s music coming though
that Fiona Apple Song that Andrew used

880
00:53:24,321 --> 00:53:26,310
last week reminded me of the summer.

881
00:53:26,310 --> 00:53:30,030
I started jerking off save
the pet store manager from,

882
00:53:31,110 --> 00:53:34,590
from last week. I don't know what that
means. Yeah. Andrew picks the music.

883
00:53:34,591 --> 00:53:39,180
I wish I was could claim a that I was
as cool as to know all this shit that he

884
00:53:39,181 --> 00:53:43,710
does. He knows a bunch
about music. Um, yeah,

885
00:53:43,770 --> 00:53:44,581
there is a lot of that.

886
00:53:44,581 --> 00:53:48,450
There's a lot of gloom and doom and all
that type of shit, but uh, you know,

887
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:51,780
it's not all it is. I, you know,

888
00:53:52,580 --> 00:53:53,413
okay.

889
00:53:54,370 --> 00:53:57,400
The Great Barrier Reef and all that
type of shit is pretty terrifying.

890
00:53:57,520 --> 00:54:02,170
All of that shit is pretty fucking
terrifying. And uh, I mean,

891
00:54:02,171 --> 00:54:06,070
I can't even focus on it if you actually
get passed all the dopes on social

892
00:54:06,071 --> 00:54:10,900
media talking about things
and you actually listened
to scientists talking about

893
00:54:11,140 --> 00:54:14,950
like whatever their predictions
are. Um, I know that there's,

894
00:54:16,150 --> 00:54:18,130
I don't know, this sounds
like a, uh, you know,

895
00:54:18,670 --> 00:54:23,380
I think it's going to be a
no, it should be interesting.

896
00:54:23,470 --> 00:54:27,760
We'll see. I hope that wrong. You know,
who the fuck knows? I Dunno. All right.

897
00:54:27,761 --> 00:54:30,580
The DNC, everybody dear Mr. Burn,

898
00:54:30,610 --> 00:54:35,610
I'm appalled and disgusted that you had
the Addis audacity to speak poorly of

899
00:54:36,820 --> 00:54:41,350
Debbie Schultz. Wasserman, a lifelong
servant of her country and the only party,

900
00:54:42,230 --> 00:54:46,450
uh, that has moved this country forward.
I usually enjoy your brand of humor.

901
00:54:46,451 --> 00:54:50,350
There's no way this
person's serious. I have C,

902
00:54:51,310 --> 00:54:56,310
I have c parts of your comedy specials
and overheard a handful of episodes of

903
00:54:57,041 --> 00:55:00,700
your podcast while in the
proxy of my brother in law,

904
00:55:01,930 --> 00:55:02,810
a. You Sir,

905
00:55:02,811 --> 00:55:07,330
I have a responsibility to tell the truth
and not just your uninformed opinions

906
00:55:07,331 --> 00:55:08,380
on politics,

907
00:55:09,050 --> 00:55:13,150
that the seat that you distribute is
going to aid in the dismantling of this

908
00:55:13,151 --> 00:55:17,740
country. Oh God, no. God,
give me a fucking break.

909
00:55:17,830 --> 00:55:20,530
You just happened to be walking by
and you heard that. Well, you know,

910
00:55:20,680 --> 00:55:23,200
the whole part of this podcast
is that I am uninformed.

911
00:55:26,080 --> 00:55:26,840
Um,

912
00:55:26,840 --> 00:55:31,400
and I sent a link that you could watch
on Youtube and listened to that lawyer

913
00:55:31,401 --> 00:55:32,234
discussing

914
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:36,430
the things that she did or didn't do.

915
00:55:36,460 --> 00:55:40,000
So I don't know what you fucking problem
is. You know, I talk about politics.

916
00:55:40,001 --> 00:55:43,300
The way I talk about sports is someone
who never did it at a professional level.

917
00:55:44,020 --> 00:55:49,020
I met Schultz Wasserman a few years back
and I asked her what we could do every

918
00:55:49,060 --> 00:55:52,780
day to change the nation for the
better. And she eloquently said,

919
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:57,970
do not let them tell
you how to feel. Oh God,

920
00:55:58,090 --> 00:56:00,070
I'm not reading the rest
of this. This is fucking

921
00:56:01,580 --> 00:56:04,460
sincerely a proud Democrat
who will not be discouraged.

922
00:56:04,461 --> 00:56:08,150
You know what you sound like.
You sound like someone, you know,

923
00:56:08,180 --> 00:56:11,960
when someone comes up to me and says, the
Patriots are cheaters, and then I say,

924
00:56:11,961 --> 00:56:15,410
who's your team? And then I talk
about the shit that they've done.

925
00:56:15,560 --> 00:56:19,960
And then they downplay that. Yet you
are, I've gotta be honest with you,

926
00:56:20,120 --> 00:56:24,070
as uninformed as I am. Um,
people like you, I can't

927
00:56:24,070 --> 00:56:29,070
even talk to because you're so lost in
your blue ties that you can't see that

928
00:56:31,540 --> 00:56:32,291
it's this. You know what?

929
00:56:32,291 --> 00:56:37,291
It's like everybody out here in Hollywood
loves to sit there and Trash Fox News

930
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:41,890
and talk about how there are
all these bullies and all that,

931
00:56:41,891 --> 00:56:44,290
and I'm going to tell you, I'm
not gonna name any fucking names,

932
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:48,670
but the amount of performers,
comedians, actresses,

933
00:56:48,671 --> 00:56:49,810
and all this type of shit,

934
00:56:49,870 --> 00:56:54,550
like their level of zero
tolerance like they are,

935
00:56:54,860 --> 00:56:57,160
they are literally what they're
fighting. They're bullies.

936
00:56:58,540 --> 00:57:02,440
They tell people how they're supposed to
think the way they're supposed to think

937
00:57:02,441 --> 00:57:04,690
and they feel that they are 100% right.

938
00:57:05,110 --> 00:57:08,230
They feel that their view of the world
is the way that the world should be.

939
00:57:08,380 --> 00:57:11,200
And anyone who doesn't think
that needs to be attacked,

940
00:57:11,201 --> 00:57:15,220
needs to be dragged on stage and
humiliated needs to have their, their,

941
00:57:15,221 --> 00:57:17,920
their ability to earn a living attacked.

942
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:21,340
It's no difference than when
you watched what Fox News did,

943
00:57:21,341 --> 00:57:24,010
did the Dixie chicks, it's
the exact same fucking thing,

944
00:57:24,190 --> 00:57:26,290
the exact same level of righteousness,

945
00:57:26,620 --> 00:57:31,240
patting themselves on the back about how
fucking smart they are and how informed

946
00:57:31,241 --> 00:57:32,800
they are. You know,

947
00:57:33,370 --> 00:57:38,170
meanwhile as they fly around and fucking
private jets, give me a fucking break.

948
00:57:38,680 --> 00:57:42,070
Give me a fucking break. Okay. You know,

949
00:57:43,450 --> 00:57:47,500
the Patriots Cheat, your team cheats,
the Republican's a pieces of shit.

950
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:52,120
The Democrats are pieces of
shit. Alright, there you go.

951
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:56,200
There you go. So, and other
than anything other than that,

952
00:57:56,410 --> 00:58:01,000
you're looking at shit through
fucking rose colored glasses. And, um,

953
00:58:01,060 --> 00:58:04,270
I think it's, I think that that is a,

954
00:58:06,250 --> 00:58:08,920
I don't know what to think. I just, I
can't have a conversation with that.

955
00:58:08,950 --> 00:58:09,610
You know what I mean?

956
00:58:09,610 --> 00:58:13,030
It's like if I listen to a red sox fan
back with Derek Jeter was playing and

957
00:58:13,031 --> 00:58:15,840
they just say that he sucks and he's
fucking overrated and blah, blah.

958
00:58:15,841 --> 00:58:17,440
And I would just sit there
and be like, no, he isn't.

959
00:58:17,441 --> 00:58:19,750
He's fucking won one of the
greatest players of all time.

960
00:58:19,870 --> 00:58:23,510
I'd love if he was on my team. You
know, I hate the Yankees, but I,

961
00:58:23,511 --> 00:58:25,870
I'm not going to hate on greatness.

962
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:29,410
Marianne Rivera is the greatest
fucking closer of all time.

963
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:30,790
I still fucking hate the Yankees,

964
00:58:30,791 --> 00:58:33,460
but I don't hate him to
a level that I can't see.

965
00:58:34,890 --> 00:58:35,390
[inaudible]

966
00:58:35,390 --> 00:58:36,890
I can't see that. You know what I mean?

967
00:58:38,650 --> 00:58:39,483
[inaudible]

968
00:58:39,540 --> 00:58:43,050
I just don't, I just don't fucking
understand it. I don't understand it.

969
00:58:43,051 --> 00:58:44,970
Like you want to talk about
spy, Geeky and the Patriots.

970
00:58:45,060 --> 00:58:49,260
We're guilty of cheating. Deflate Gate
was bullshit. Spy Gate was true. However,

971
00:58:49,290 --> 00:58:51,870
they were only guilty of,
of doing it for one game.

972
00:58:51,871 --> 00:58:54,660
And I only clarify that because everybody
thinks well they should take away all

973
00:58:54,661 --> 00:58:57,450
their titles because that's what they
were doing now. That was the first game.

974
00:58:57,451 --> 00:59:00,810
It was illegal and they kept
fucking doing it. All right.

975
00:59:00,811 --> 00:59:05,040
And they were 100% guilty or they deserve
to be fucking fine because they were

976
00:59:05,041 --> 00:59:07,410
cheating then. Yes,
they were that one time.

977
00:59:07,620 --> 00:59:11,100
All the other stuff was bullshit
though. However, if they,

978
00:59:11,310 --> 00:59:14,100
cause I'm a one deflate gay came out, I
was like, if they did this shit again,

979
00:59:14,220 --> 00:59:18,850
I'm done with this fucking
team. That's what I said.

980
00:59:18,851 --> 00:59:20,950
And then I watched the whole fucking
thing unfold and I was like, oh,

981
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:21,950
this was just bullshit.

982
00:59:23,330 --> 00:59:23,970
Okay,

983
00:59:23,970 --> 00:59:24,803
so there you go.

984
00:59:24,860 --> 00:59:27,720
Does that sound evenhanded you guys
probably think I'm too much of a patriots

985
00:59:27,721 --> 00:59:31,710
fan, but I mean I did it. They spygate
was cheating and they were guilty.

986
00:59:32,490 --> 00:59:35,790
They did it one game. Raymond.
Janie fucking ratted him out.

987
00:59:37,720 --> 00:59:41,540
Okay, then that was it. They will
fucking guilty. What are you going to do?

988
00:59:41,750 --> 00:59:45,500
Does that make them worse than anybody
else? No. Bill Walsh fucking cheated.

989
00:59:46,220 --> 00:59:47,000
So there you go.

990
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:51,230
They should democrats and you Republicans
say the Patriots are Democrats.

991
00:59:51,231 --> 00:59:54,650
I'm a patriots fan, so I am a democrat.
Okay. But I could see their fucking,

992
00:59:55,490 --> 00:59:59,630
I can see that spygate was fucking
cheating and they were guilty of it.

993
00:59:59,720 --> 01:00:01,310
And I could also see that Bill Walsh.

994
01:00:02,420 --> 01:00:02,730
Okay.

995
01:00:02,730 --> 01:00:05,820
Fuck it. Did the same thing when he
pretended his fucking headsets went out.

996
01:00:07,510 --> 01:00:10,210
It's not that fucking heart. Um,

997
01:00:10,211 --> 01:00:13,420
I don't understand what your
point is that the, Oh my God,

998
01:00:13,421 --> 01:00:16,540
this person was used to fucking meeting
proves, you know, they said, would she,

999
01:00:16,541 --> 01:00:21,490
we do easy. Don't let them
capitols tell you how to feel.

1000
01:00:21,700 --> 01:00:25,330
That is such like, that has
got to be the most vague.

1001
01:00:25,810 --> 01:00:29,650
I'm on my way to my town car
fucking horseshit response ever.

1002
01:00:32,030 --> 01:00:33,950
Hey Bill. Uh,

1003
01:00:33,980 --> 01:00:38,510
what's your secret to being as
successful standup comedian?

1004
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:43,040
Uh, you just get out there
and keep doing it, man.

1005
01:00:44,950 --> 01:00:48,470
All right. Girlfriend won't
take racist last name.

1006
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:54,350
All right, dear. Bills burry. Doughboy
Hey, fuck you man. I'm under one 80.

1007
01:00:54,620 --> 01:00:58,860
Okay. Go easy. Go easy.
You know. All right,

1008
01:00:58,890 --> 01:01:01,290
dear bill's very doughboy. Uh,

1009
01:01:01,320 --> 01:01:05,470
my girlfriend of three years has
made it very clear that if we,

1010
01:01:05,790 --> 01:01:09,450
if I were to propose to her that
she would not take my last name.

1011
01:01:10,020 --> 01:01:13,230
The reason being is that she
feels my last name is racist.

1012
01:01:13,950 --> 01:01:17,760
The name is Koons, spelled c. O. N. S.

1013
01:01:18,060 --> 01:01:22,650
I told her that I have never encountered
a problem having this last name and she

1014
01:01:22,651 --> 01:01:25,590
has nothing to worry about.
Thoughts. Yeah. Here's my thoughts.

1015
01:01:25,591 --> 01:01:29,300
I think you're making this
up and if you're not, um,

1016
01:01:29,370 --> 01:01:33,060
that woman is too dumb to
marry and reproduce with.

1017
01:01:33,160 --> 01:01:35,480
Yeah. Right.

1018
01:01:37,780 --> 01:01:41,110
If you call a black person
a coon that is racist.

1019
01:01:41,111 --> 01:01:44,050
If your last name is coons, it isn't,

1020
01:01:45,500 --> 01:01:48,890
you know, like I see if your last name
was the n word, then yeah. I mean,

1021
01:01:48,891 --> 01:01:53,190
maybe you want to, you know, yeah. I mean,

1022
01:01:53,240 --> 01:01:56,710
if it's, I don't know. I, yeah, I
mean if that's your fucking last name,

1023
01:01:56,970 --> 01:01:58,690
that's a believable last name, isn't it?

1024
01:02:00,120 --> 01:02:00,953
You know what I mean?

1025
01:02:03,090 --> 01:02:07,590
I Dunno. Anyways, my roommate is,
you know, like, I'm trying to think,

1026
01:02:07,591 --> 01:02:11,130
I'm trying to think of a fucking racial
group I can do here without getting in

1027
01:02:11,131 --> 01:02:12,930
trouble. Cause I want
to really do a fucking,

1028
01:02:14,070 --> 01:02:15,630
I guess I got to go against my own,

1029
01:02:17,570 --> 01:02:19,500
my own fucking racist.

1030
01:02:21,610 --> 01:02:24,990
What I do if there's no good ones,
there is no good ones with white people.

1031
01:02:25,260 --> 01:02:29,400
Cause like it doesn't have
an effect on us. Nah. Shit.

1032
01:02:29,850 --> 01:02:30,541
You know what I mean? I don't know.

1033
01:02:30,541 --> 01:02:33,180
Maybe in the future some other group
takes over and then we'll have that.

1034
01:02:33,181 --> 01:02:37,860
We'll have our, you know, you
can't call me cracker. Um,

1035
01:02:38,430 --> 01:02:42,210
I love crackers. I love putting cheese
on it. My roommate is a fucking Weirdo.

1036
01:02:43,020 --> 01:02:47,430
Dear Conti. McConn fuck. Uh, first of
all, a big fan of the fucking podcast,

1037
01:02:47,431 --> 01:02:50,460
the last fucking Netflix special
was phenomenal. So thanks. Okay.

1038
01:02:50,700 --> 01:02:52,470
Now needs is one of
these people that thinks,

1039
01:02:52,471 --> 01:02:54,300
because I swear that
now they have to swear.

1040
01:02:54,301 --> 01:02:57,060
You don't have to bring yourself
down to my level, sir. Anyways,

1041
01:02:57,061 --> 01:02:59,100
I just fucking moved into
college as a freshman.

1042
01:02:59,101 --> 01:03:03,540
My roommate is a hot
motherfucker. I mean I'm gay.

1043
01:03:03,541 --> 01:03:05,190
So right away I was into them,

1044
01:03:05,220 --> 01:03:09,570
but I kept to myself since I had
no way of knowing he was gay too.

1045
01:03:10,530 --> 01:03:14,130
I thought you guys had Gaydar
you couldn't sense it. Um,

1046
01:03:14,160 --> 01:03:17,310
so last week on Friday after
a fucking drunk at night out,

1047
01:03:17,311 --> 01:03:19,980
we returned to our room.
Oh Geez. Here we go.

1048
01:03:20,280 --> 01:03:23,400
And the fucking guy
offhandedly tells me he's gay.

1049
01:03:23,820 --> 01:03:26,550
Once the conversation started
getting more personal,

1050
01:03:27,060 --> 01:03:32,060
then I told them I'm also
gay and this guy says fag.

1051
01:03:32,100 --> 01:03:36,570
I don't think this is real.
After which we proceeded to fuck,

1052
01:03:36,571 --> 01:03:39,510
which was fucking amazing.
By the way. I find the term,

1053
01:03:40,110 --> 01:03:43,860
I find the fag term endearing. So
fuck all the political correctness.

1054
01:03:43,861 --> 01:03:46,650
Hysteria by gays and non gaze alike.

1055
01:03:48,920 --> 01:03:50,690
All right, I'm just going
to read this. Okay. Anyways,

1056
01:03:50,691 --> 01:03:54,710
this is when the shit started to hit
the fan. No Pun intended. Sorry Dude.

1057
01:03:54,711 --> 01:03:58,430
You loved it over the
fucking net. Um, once I came,

1058
01:03:58,431 --> 01:04:01,470
he expressed disappointment
at the volume of my comp.

1059
01:04:02,180 --> 01:04:06,350
Does anyone believe this is true? The
fucker literally said that's it. What?

1060
01:04:06,351 --> 01:04:10,160
Are you sick or something? I
felt fucking inadequate sense.

1061
01:04:10,161 --> 01:04:13,550
His load was considered
really bigger than mine.

1062
01:04:15,610 --> 01:04:15,890
Okay.

1063
01:04:15,890 --> 01:04:19,970
Oh Jesus Christ. So then the next
morning he says he wants to fuck again.

1064
01:04:19,971 --> 01:04:23,030
I go along with it like, he's so hot,

1065
01:04:23,120 --> 01:04:27,320
I'm not going to refuse halfway through
this motherfucker says, you know,

1066
01:04:27,321 --> 01:04:29,930
for a tall guy, you
sure have a small Dick.

1067
01:04:30,620 --> 01:04:31,390
Yeah.

1068
01:04:31,390 --> 01:04:33,670
And he writes like, what
the fuck? Yeah. Well Dude,

1069
01:04:33,671 --> 01:04:36,520
you came back from more abuse
here. So I'm all for two, right?

1070
01:04:36,700 --> 01:04:40,780
Inadequate Dick size check, lack
of Herculean come shot check.

1071
01:04:42,070 --> 01:04:46,600
Uh, is insulting the people.
He fucks part of his style.

1072
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:49,630
Like I can't figure out why he
still wants to fuck. We have to,

1073
01:04:49,840 --> 01:04:53,110
to colossal fucking insults.
So what the fuck do I do next?

1074
01:04:53,111 --> 01:04:57,920
So stop fucking the guy. Ah,

1075
01:04:57,990 --> 01:05:01,140
fuck knows. But the next day
we're chugging peers in our room.

1076
01:05:03,430 --> 01:05:04,020
Okay.

1077
01:05:04,020 --> 01:05:08,070
You know, other than, than the gay
sexist sounds amazing that, sorry,

1078
01:05:08,071 --> 01:05:10,800
I'm looking at this as a straight guy. Um,

1079
01:05:12,680 --> 01:05:17,110
what the fuck am I? Uh,
okay. Well chugging beers,

1080
01:05:17,170 --> 01:05:19,870
a room and he suggest
something beyond weird. Oh God.

1081
01:05:19,871 --> 01:05:24,190
He's basically tells me He wants
me to pee in his mouth. You know,

1082
01:05:24,191 --> 01:05:26,380
even if this is fake, this
is tremendously Korean.

1083
01:05:26,381 --> 01:05:29,800
If you got to give this up a case since
it turns him on, since it turns a mom,

1084
01:05:29,830 --> 01:05:33,740
I'm eight beers deep and I'm a
lightweight, so I'm like, fuck it dude.

1085
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:34,480
I swear to God,

1086
01:05:34,480 --> 01:05:38,630
if this is true and you piss in this guy's
mouth and he's like [inaudible] I set

1087
01:05:38,870 --> 01:05:39,440
a,

1088
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:43,930
this motherfucker has a stream like a
God damn firehose and nearly broke my jaw

1089
01:05:43,931 --> 01:05:47,920
in the process. What?

1090
01:05:48,580 --> 01:05:50,080
I don't believe that Jesus Christ.

1091
01:05:50,081 --> 01:05:53,770
So I'm completely weirded out
by this colossal cont dude.

1092
01:05:53,771 --> 01:05:55,300
You let them piss in your mouth.

1093
01:05:58,360 --> 01:06:01,510
His only saving graces that he happens
to be the hottest guy I ever met.

1094
01:06:01,511 --> 01:06:03,850
So bill, what the fuck do
I do? Do I change room,

1095
01:06:04,180 --> 01:06:09,040
kick this con to the curb and sleep and
never sleep with the game or do I stick

1096
01:06:09,940 --> 01:06:14,560
stick in there so that I can
stick it in there. Thanks.

1097
01:06:14,561 --> 01:06:18,820
And Go fuck yourself. You
McGee Bitch. Uh, I don't know.

1098
01:06:18,821 --> 01:06:20,650
It sounds like you feel bad afterwards.

1099
01:06:22,190 --> 01:06:25,120
If I was with a woman and she was doing
this shit to me and she was really hot,

1100
01:06:25,121 --> 01:06:26,350
yeah, I'd probably keep going back,

1101
01:06:26,351 --> 01:06:28,840
but I would just get
myself mentally prepared.

1102
01:06:29,140 --> 01:06:31,930
You know what you might do just
telling me as a weird asshole.

1103
01:06:34,220 --> 01:06:35,053
Okay.

1104
01:06:35,380 --> 01:06:39,810
You got to get in his head. Tell him a,

1105
01:06:39,820 --> 01:06:42,890
his ass is too hairy. He needs
to braid the hair on his ass of,

1106
01:06:43,060 --> 01:06:45,400
so I don't know what the fuck did to,
I mean [inaudible] you're outside,

1107
01:06:45,880 --> 01:06:48,140
you know, this is still
basically human interaction.

1108
01:06:48,141 --> 01:06:49,570
So you're talking about feelings here.

1109
01:06:49,571 --> 01:06:52,930
So do you want to get childish
to say something mean to him

1110
01:06:54,590 --> 01:06:56,330
and uh, I don't know.

1111
01:06:56,360 --> 01:06:59,720
You know what's weird is Josh just
showed up and now I have to smoke a cigar

1112
01:06:59,721 --> 01:07:03,840
after reading that
shit. Yeah, dude, don't,

1113
01:07:03,890 --> 01:07:06,140
don't fucking go back. Don't
go back for more. Right.

1114
01:07:06,350 --> 01:07:10,880
Or if you're going to go back for
more, I'm sorry, I'm texting him. Hey,

1115
01:07:11,220 --> 01:07:15,620
hang on. All right. Uh, yeah, you
don't need to put up with that shit.

1116
01:07:18,540 --> 01:07:20,840
Everything's like a pun in this. Um,

1117
01:07:23,800 --> 01:07:25,750
the weird thing is that
you live with the guy.

1118
01:07:26,620 --> 01:07:31,610
It's never good to fuck your
roommate. You know, it's, that's,

1119
01:07:31,640 --> 01:07:32,810
that's never going to be a good thing.

1120
01:07:32,811 --> 01:07:36,260
But I don't know how it works with gay
guys cause you're both guys. Right.

1121
01:07:37,020 --> 01:07:37,520
Okay.

1122
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:41,240
So I would think you'd be able to just
be like, yeah, we'll just fucking write.

1123
01:07:41,241 --> 01:07:44,630
Then we'll watch a game and fucking
drink some beers and I'll fucking piss in

1124
01:07:44,631 --> 01:07:46,490
your mouth. Evidently. I
guess that's how it goes down.

1125
01:07:46,491 --> 01:07:49,130
I don't know what the fuck
happens here. So I would just, uh,

1126
01:07:49,610 --> 01:07:52,370
if he sincerely is making
you feel bad, then I would,

1127
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:56,000
I would try to find a better guy. Um,

1128
01:07:58,130 --> 01:08:00,870
but consider you live with them.
You obviously get to see kids. Nike,

1129
01:08:00,920 --> 01:08:03,770
you can just blow the guy off. So at some
point he's going to be like, hey man,

1130
01:08:03,771 --> 01:08:08,220
you want to fuck you gotta be like,
Nah, I don't. You'd be like, why not?

1131
01:08:08,330 --> 01:08:12,740
It'd be okay cause you're a dick. You
say mean shit to me and I don't like it.

1132
01:08:13,360 --> 01:08:14,193
All right,

1133
01:08:14,570 --> 01:08:17,650
so why don't you in there and go rub one
out and piss in your own fucking mouth.

1134
01:08:17,800 --> 01:08:22,610
You're fucking Dosha or you
just move up. All right,

1135
01:08:23,060 --> 01:08:25,730
that's the podcast. Everybody, God
bless each and every one of you.

1136
01:08:26,480 --> 01:08:29,150
Go fuck yourselves and I'll
check in on you on Thursday.
