00:00:04.992 --> 00:00:05.700
- Hello everyone.

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.510
Welcome to the
Radcliffe Institute.

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:11.320
It's great to see so many
people out for this event.

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:12.570
My name is Sean O'Donnell.

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.020
I'm the associate director
for academic ventures.

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.350
And for those of you who
don't know, academic ventures

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:21.540
it's a group at Radcliffe
that brings together people

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:25.620
from across the university to
discuss all kinds of issues

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:28.800
of importance to bringing
people together to discuss ideas

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.549
from different perspectives,
different disciplinary

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:33.910
perspectives.

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:36.560
And it's my pleasure, on
this particular project,

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:40.740
to be working with Megan Hill
from the honoring nations

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:44.160
project, and also to
be working with Shelley

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.220
Lowe, of the Harvard University
native-american project.

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:50.292
And we know we have some really
wonderful and important topics

00:00:50.292 --> 00:00:51.000
to address today.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.920
This year at the
institute we've been

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.230
looking at citizenship for
this year and for next year.

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:58.680
And there are so
many ways in which

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.230
we know that this topic,
today, deeply affects notions

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.319
of citizenship on native land.

00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:07.980
I also invite you to come to
Layli Long Soldier's poetry

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:09.750
reading this Thursday.

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.300
It's also at 4:15, and
also will be in this room.

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:14.610
And also, to our
gender conference,

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.910
which is entitled, "Who belongs?

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:19.351
Global citizenship
the 21st century."

00:01:19.351 --> 00:01:21.600
Our keynote speaker for that
is Pulitzer Prize winning

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.240
novelist, Jhumpa Lahiry.

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.632
And we'd love to have
you, again, explore

00:01:26.632 --> 00:01:28.590
the idea of citizenship
from many perspectives.

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.520
And we know that today's
event is promising

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.610
to do some really wonderful
work in understanding

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.760
the ways in which the Native
American people and tribes

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:44.370
and nations are trying to make
sense of many of the things

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:46.720
that they have inherited
in their world.

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:48.690
So without further
ado, I'm going

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:52.350
to bring up Shelley Lowe,
who's going to, I think,

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.570
introduce the panelists
and get us started.

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:55.070
Thanks.

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:13.800
- [NON-NENGLISH SPEECH]

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:14.620
Good afternoon.

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:15.660
My name is Shelly Lowe.

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.730
I am a citizen of
the Navajo Nation.

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.250
I am originally from
Ganado, Arizona.

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.110
I am also currently
the executive director

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.840
of the Harvard University
native-american program.

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.810
I want to acknowledge quickly,
the Massachusetts people whose

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.300
land we're on, but also
the Wampanoag and the Muk

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.970
peoples, whose histories
are so intimately tied

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:34.710
to this institution.

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:36.512
Before we get started
with introductions,

00:02:36.512 --> 00:02:38.470
I'm going to ask my
colleague, Jason Packineau,

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.150
to come up to say a quick
blessing for our event today.

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.320
And we do ask that nobody record
or take pictures at this time.

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:51.260
Thank you Jason.

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.630
Our panel tonight,
or this evening,

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:58.350
is part of a conversation based
on a recently published book.

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.320
And unfortunately, I
didn't bring my book.

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:03.080
But I do know one of our
speakers has his book with him.

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:05.750
The book is The Great
Vanishing Act, Blood Quantum

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:08.000
and the Future Native Nations.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.220
And one of the editors
is with us today.

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:12.140
Mr. Norbert Hill, and
I'm sure he will talk

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:13.530
about it a little bit more.

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.590
I encourage everyone to
take a look at the book,

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:19.714
it talks about citizenship from
various tribal points of view.

00:03:19.714 --> 00:03:21.880
From youth point of view,
to a tribal point of view,

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:23.342
to historical points of view.

00:03:23.342 --> 00:03:24.800
And it's very good
and will kind of

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.390
guide some of our
conversation today.

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:31.680

And to begin our
panel tonight, we're

00:08:08.110 --> 00:08:11.470
going to have Professor
Bruce Duthu start us off.

00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:17.430
- Thank you, and
thank you Shelly.

00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:23.220
Thank you to our native tribal
hosts on whose lands we meet.

00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:26.960
And thank you to the Institute
for hosting this event.

00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:29.190
It's a great pleasure
to be back in Cambridge.

00:08:29.190 --> 00:08:31.050
I feel badly that we're
keeping you indoors

00:08:31.050 --> 00:08:35.049
on such a gorgeous day after
the winter we've been through.

00:08:35.049 --> 00:08:37.559
So thank you for indulging us.

00:08:37.559 --> 00:08:39.630
I'm not going to say
too much at this point,

00:08:39.630 --> 00:08:43.200
because our panelists
are ready to go.

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:46.950
I'll have a few things to
say by way of summation,

00:08:46.950 --> 00:08:49.110
and then some questions
for our panelists

00:08:49.110 --> 00:08:53.220
before we turn it over to you,
the audience, to ask questions.

00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:55.380
So the way that we're
going to proceed,

00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:58.560
each panelist will
have about 15 minutes.

00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:00.840
At least that's what I
was told that you have.

00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:04.380
About 15 minutes to
share their own comments

00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:06.510
on the topic for today.

00:09:06.510 --> 00:09:11.640
And followed by a few questions
that I've circulated to them

00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:12.450
to think about.

00:09:12.450 --> 00:09:14.610
I probably won't ask
all the questions,

00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:16.890
I went into that
professorial mode

00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:21.940
where you just kind of
ask questions ad nauseum.

00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:24.300
So I'll try to ask maybe
just two or three questions.

00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:28.080
And then, just to get them
primed for your questions,

00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:30.420
and then we'll turn
it over to you.

00:09:30.420 --> 00:09:33.510
When it is your turn
to ask questions,

00:09:33.510 --> 00:09:36.000
there will be a mic
set up right here

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.850
in the center of the hallway.

00:09:38.850 --> 00:09:42.900
And we ask that you identify
yourself, where you're from,

00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:46.680
and ask as brief a
question as you can.

00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:47.430
OK?

00:09:47.430 --> 00:09:48.570
Thank you very much.

00:09:48.570 --> 00:09:50.850
So I don't know what
order that we have.

00:09:50.850 --> 00:09:52.590
If you want to go in
a particular order.

00:09:52.590 --> 00:09:53.970
You want to start us off Olivia?

00:09:53.970 --> 00:09:54.470
Thank you.

00:10:02.730 --> 00:10:08.280
- [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:09.220
Hello, everyone.

00:10:09.220 --> 00:10:10.290
My name is Olivia Hoeft.

00:10:10.290 --> 00:10:13.320
My Oneida name is Iago hocky,
which means her road is good.

00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:15.030
I'm from the Oneida
Nation of Wisconsin,

00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:17.000
and I am turtle clan.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.500
First of all, I just want to
say how humbled I am to be here

00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:21.870
and among the amazing company
of my fellow panelists.

00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:24.328
And how grateful I am to the
Radcliffe Institute for having

00:10:24.328 --> 00:10:27.999
us, and for carving out space
to have such a vital discussion.

00:10:27.999 --> 00:10:29.790
This is one of the most
important questions

00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:31.540
of our time for native people.

00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:34.290
And whatever we decide will lay
the foundation for generations

00:10:34.290 --> 00:10:37.300
to carry on the conversation
we are starting today.

00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:38.850
It is a difficult
question to ask

00:10:38.850 --> 00:10:40.950
and there sadly is
no one right answer

00:10:40.950 --> 00:10:42.960
that has been hiding in
plain sight all along

00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:44.550
when it comes to blood quantum.

00:10:44.550 --> 00:10:47.470
What great news that would be,
we could all head home early.

00:10:47.470 --> 00:10:49.524
But to me, it is an
inspiring time as well.

00:10:49.524 --> 00:10:50.940
For so much of our
history we have

00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:54.300
worked within the definitions
of other outside forces.

00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:56.041
Of what it means to
be Native American.

00:10:56.041 --> 00:10:57.540
And I believe this
is an opportunity

00:10:57.540 --> 00:10:59.820
to decide for ourselves.

00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:03.690
My mother, Patty Hoeft, served
on our elected tribal council

00:11:03.690 --> 00:11:06.150
for three terms, a
total of nine years.

00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:08.260
Following in the
footsteps of her mother,

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:09.810
my grandmother
Sandra [? Nedham, ?]

00:11:09.810 --> 00:11:11.685
who was one of the two
women to start a bingo

00:11:11.685 --> 00:11:16.027
game on our tribes
reservation in the 1970s.

00:11:16.027 --> 00:11:17.610
One of the first in
the country, which

00:11:17.610 --> 00:11:22.140
went on to become our tribe's
Casino as we know it today.

00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:24.720
My family's legacy of
contributing to Oneida survival

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:27.660
has profoundly impacted my
Native American identity

00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:29.970
and sense of
citizenship to my tribe.

00:11:29.970 --> 00:11:32.010
The question of what
it means to be Oneida,

00:11:32.010 --> 00:11:34.010
and of what I can do
for Oneida's survival,

00:11:34.010 --> 00:11:36.510
is something I've thought about
almost every day of my life,

00:11:36.510 --> 00:11:40.120
and has influenced any decision
I've made in my life so far.

00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:42.150
Especially when it comes
to where I've lived.

00:11:42.150 --> 00:11:44.370
Tribes are place based cultures.

00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:46.922
We are, because of where we are.

00:11:46.922 --> 00:11:49.380
Growing up, the world seemed
a little more black and white.

00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:52.620
That there only was Oneida and
the rest of the world was not.

00:11:52.620 --> 00:11:55.410
Not unlike the binary quality
of blood quantum itself,

00:11:55.410 --> 00:11:58.710
which views identity as either
or, rather than a spectrum.

00:11:58.710 --> 00:12:00.930
I was born and raised on
the Oneida reservation.

00:12:00.930 --> 00:12:03.115
My mother is Oneida,
and my father is white.

00:12:03.115 --> 00:12:04.740
They met and fell in
love while working

00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:06.300
at the local newspaper
in Green Bay,

00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:08.364
and had me and my
older sister Lauren.

00:12:08.364 --> 00:12:09.780
And although my
mom had always had

00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:11.580
dreams of leaving
Oneida eventually

00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:13.505
to pursue different
goals she had,

00:12:13.505 --> 00:12:15.630
she always knew that it
was vital to our identities

00:12:15.630 --> 00:12:17.760
to be raised in
Oneida, around Oneidas.

00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:19.410
So she stayed.

00:12:19.410 --> 00:12:21.780
We found out recently that
my sister and I are actually

00:12:21.780 --> 00:12:24.990
the seventh generation matronly,
and the 10th generation

00:12:24.990 --> 00:12:27.300
patronly in our family
to be born and raised

00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:28.830
in Oneida Wisconsin.

00:12:28.830 --> 00:12:30.330
That is no small feat.

00:12:30.330 --> 00:12:33.270
Despite many warring factors
and outside influences,

00:12:33.270 --> 00:12:35.760
since the Oneidas of Wisconsin
first left their homelands

00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:39.270
in New York, and moved
to Wisconsin in 1822,

00:12:39.270 --> 00:12:42.480
all of my ancestors not
only survived, but also have

00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:46.030
made the same choice to stay
generation after generation.

00:12:46.030 --> 00:12:48.490
And my mother made
that choice as well.

00:12:48.490 --> 00:12:50.246
I also plan to make that choice.

00:12:50.246 --> 00:12:52.620
When I meet new people and
they learn about my connection

00:12:52.620 --> 00:12:55.200
to Oneida, how it
worries me to live away,

00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:56.970
and how often I
try to visit home,

00:12:56.970 --> 00:12:58.410
or how annoyingly
difficult it is

00:12:58.410 --> 00:13:00.750
to find a nonstop flight
to the middle of Wisconsin

00:13:00.750 --> 00:13:01.890
in the winter.

00:13:01.890 --> 00:13:04.020
Usually the first thing
they ask is, do you

00:13:04.020 --> 00:13:06.270
think you'll ever move
back home permanently?

00:13:06.270 --> 00:13:08.040
Which to me, is an
ironic question.

00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:10.950
Because I only ever left
because I always knew

00:13:10.950 --> 00:13:12.810
I would come back
home eventually.

00:13:12.810 --> 00:13:15.990
And moreover, I only was
able to leave because I

00:13:15.990 --> 00:13:18.120
knew I could come back home.

00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:20.490
Growing up as a
young native person,

00:13:20.490 --> 00:13:23.040
you are confronted with
the idea of long term goals

00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:24.900
a little earlier
than your peers.

00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:27.480
I knew as a child that
Oneida and many other tribes

00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:28.712
were in survival mode.

00:13:28.712 --> 00:13:31.170
I knew that blood quantum would
mean something to me when I

00:13:31.170 --> 00:13:32.849
chose a partner in the future.

00:13:32.849 --> 00:13:34.890
And I always knew that
one day I would come home.

00:13:34.890 --> 00:13:37.473
That I would return to Oneida,
and that that part of my future

00:13:37.473 --> 00:13:39.030
I had already decided.

00:13:39.030 --> 00:13:42.060
Until then though, I have big
dreams of what I wanted to do,

00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:44.100
the things I wanted to
learn, and the skills

00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:46.500
I hoped to bring back
to my tribe one day.

00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:49.260
This is actually where
Norb Hill enters my story.

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:51.720
Norb was the director of the
United education department,

00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:53.119
and was close to my family.

00:13:53.119 --> 00:13:54.660
We briefly spoke
earlier that I think

00:13:54.660 --> 00:13:57.420
he's known my family for
four generations now.

00:13:57.420 --> 00:13:59.910
His kids had gone to a boarding
school in Rhode Island,

00:13:59.910 --> 00:14:00.930
called st. George's.

00:14:00.930 --> 00:14:02.400
Hi Megan.

00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:05.000
And he put the crazy idea into
my mom's head, who then put it

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.530
into mine, that I should apply.

00:14:07.530 --> 00:14:08.970
I was scared, but intrigued.

00:14:08.970 --> 00:14:10.950
My mother told me
repeatedly, just go.

00:14:10.950 --> 00:14:12.750
You'll always have a
home to come back to.

00:14:12.750 --> 00:14:15.480
We will hold your
place here in Oneida.

00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:17.610
Boarding schools have a
controversial and traumatic

00:14:17.610 --> 00:14:19.401
history in the native
community-- although,

00:14:19.401 --> 00:14:21.450
less well known in
mainstream society--

00:14:21.450 --> 00:14:24.720
in which many native youths were
taken by force or circumstance

00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:26.370
to attend boarding
schools in the US

00:14:26.370 --> 00:14:28.760
where their hair was cut,
their language was forbidden,

00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:32.170
and education was largely used
as a tool of assimilation.

00:14:32.170 --> 00:14:34.470
This was a radical fork
in the road for my life

00:14:34.470 --> 00:14:35.490
and for my family.

00:14:35.490 --> 00:14:38.430
Both in how out of left field
the decision to leave home

00:14:38.430 --> 00:14:40.470
at 14 years old and
go to boarding school

00:14:40.470 --> 00:14:42.840
would be even if I
weren't Native American.

00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:44.380
I really, only up
until this point,

00:14:44.380 --> 00:14:46.088
I had thought that
boarding schools exist

00:14:46.088 --> 00:14:47.490
in the realm of Harry Potter.

00:14:47.490 --> 00:14:51.420
But I'm sure that had some
impact on my decision to go.

00:14:51.420 --> 00:14:54.480
But also how ironic it was to be
a young native person choosing

00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:56.570
to leave home to attend
a boarding school,

00:14:56.570 --> 00:14:58.350
and how different
my choice looked

00:14:58.350 --> 00:15:00.872
compared to other native
people throughout history.

00:15:00.872 --> 00:15:02.580
My grandfather went
to an Indian boarding

00:15:02.580 --> 00:15:05.760
school in Tomo, Wisconsin, when
he was just eight years old.

00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:08.040
To me, I was always
affected both by how recent

00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:10.290
the trauma of boarding
schools are in our history.

00:15:10.290 --> 00:15:11.880
Just two generations ago.

00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:14.310
But also, that in
just two generations,

00:15:14.310 --> 00:15:17.890
we were already reclaiming
these institutions as our own.

00:15:17.890 --> 00:15:20.190
And if going to boarding
school wasn't ironic enough,

00:15:20.190 --> 00:15:22.680
I decided a year later it
would be an amazing experience

00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:24.870
to attend an abroad
program at 16

00:15:24.870 --> 00:15:26.490
when I was a junior
in high school.

00:15:26.490 --> 00:15:29.190
Where 517 years
after Columbus first

00:15:29.190 --> 00:15:34.330
left Spain to visit the New
World, I returned the visit.

00:15:34.330 --> 00:15:36.840
Again, I was afraid to
go so far from home.

00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:38.940
But again, my mother
told me, just go.

00:15:38.940 --> 00:15:40.220
Just try it.

00:15:40.220 --> 00:15:41.730
We'll keep the fires
burning for you

00:15:41.730 --> 00:15:43.830
in Oneida until you come home.

00:15:43.830 --> 00:15:45.690
I went on to attend
Stanford University,

00:15:45.690 --> 00:15:47.802
and I've stayed in
California ever since.

00:15:47.802 --> 00:15:49.260
I now work at
Google, and am a lead

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:50.940
of our Google American
[INAUDIBLE] network there.

00:15:50.940 --> 00:15:52.260
Which is an internal
resource group

00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:54.593
that aims to make an impact
in both the native community

00:15:54.593 --> 00:15:56.370
at and outside of Google.

00:15:56.370 --> 00:15:58.470
Looking back on my life
and the radical decision

00:15:58.470 --> 00:16:00.870
to go to a boarding school
that changed the course of it,

00:16:00.870 --> 00:16:03.750
I know that leaving home was
not possible for me in spite

00:16:03.750 --> 00:16:05.910
of my connection to place.

00:16:05.910 --> 00:16:07.440
But because of it.

00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:08.970
For future native
youth I hope we

00:16:08.970 --> 00:16:10.440
are able to tell them the same.

00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:13.470
To go out, to just try, and
that will keep the fires burning

00:16:13.470 --> 00:16:15.120
until they return home.

00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:16.860
As I look ahead
to my future, I'm

00:16:16.860 --> 00:16:20.460
aware that my life looks like
a blood quantum case study.

00:16:20.460 --> 00:16:22.350
My mother is just
shy of being, and I

00:16:22.350 --> 00:16:25.290
hate the term full blooded,
but a full blooded Oneida.

00:16:25.290 --> 00:16:27.210
So I am 7/16th Oneida.

00:16:27.210 --> 00:16:30.270
1/16 shy of being
truly half blooded.

00:16:30.270 --> 00:16:32.730
Which means that my children,
if they don't have an Oneida

00:16:32.730 --> 00:16:36.930
father, will be 1/32nd short
of a quarter, of having

00:16:36.930 --> 00:16:39.134
enough blood quantum
to be enrolled.

00:16:39.134 --> 00:16:40.800
For people with blood
quantum like mine,

00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:44.880
this missing 1/32nd drop of
blood, brings the question,

00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:46.920
how is it possible
if I am Oneida,

00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:49.840
and that if being Oneida
has defined my life so much,

00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:51.690
how can my children not be?

00:16:51.690 --> 00:16:53.407
I am dismayed at
how it only takes

00:16:53.407 --> 00:16:54.990
marrying outside of
Oneida essentially

00:16:54.990 --> 00:16:58.200
twice, to bring down the legacy
of the generations of Oneidas

00:16:58.200 --> 00:16:58.860
before me.

00:16:58.860 --> 00:17:01.290
7 and 10 on each side.

00:17:01.290 --> 00:17:03.960
And how easily blood quantum
undermines their choices

00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:05.490
and sacrifices.

00:17:05.490 --> 00:17:07.829
It pains me in this view
that my father has somehow

00:17:07.829 --> 00:17:10.380
weakened my identity through
blood, when in truth, he

00:17:10.380 --> 00:17:12.780
has only strengthened my
identity, Oneida identity,

00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:13.859
in practice.

00:17:13.859 --> 00:17:16.140
Growing up he took me to
Oneida language classes,

00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:18.300
accompanied me to
events in the community,

00:17:18.300 --> 00:17:19.920
mapped our family
tree, and always

00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:21.359
reminded me of our history.

00:17:21.359 --> 00:17:24.819
Making it a relevant part of our
family discussions growing up.

00:17:24.819 --> 00:17:26.819
He also helped other
Oneidas tell their stories,

00:17:26.819 --> 00:17:28.887
and document Oneidas
history for the future.

00:17:28.887 --> 00:17:31.470
A few years ago he wrote a book
about the origin of our tribes

00:17:31.470 --> 00:17:33.990
Casino, and my
grandmother's part in it.

00:17:33.990 --> 00:17:36.990
Conducting countless interviews
with Oneidas in the community.

00:17:36.990 --> 00:17:38.970
It is called The Bingo
Queens of Oneida,

00:17:38.970 --> 00:17:42.030
How Two Moms Started
Tribal Gaming in Wisconsin.

00:17:42.030 --> 00:17:43.500
Oneidas, by
tradition, have always

00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:45.270
had a pro-adoption policy.

00:17:45.270 --> 00:17:48.900
And really no concept of blood
or DNA as factors to membership

00:17:48.900 --> 00:17:50.130
of the tribe.

00:17:50.130 --> 00:17:52.800
As Houghton schoeni people,
people of the Longhouse,

00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:54.630
we had a value of
continually extending

00:17:54.630 --> 00:17:57.570
the rafters of the Longhouse
to make room for newcomers.

00:17:57.570 --> 00:18:01.170
Or those that had married into
or been adopted into the tribe.

00:18:01.170 --> 00:18:02.850
Everywhere I've
been in life allies

00:18:02.850 --> 00:18:05.100
have been integral to
flourishing communities that

00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:06.660
have withstood
historical trauma.

00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:08.160
I believe it is
vital that there are

00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:10.890
support systems and fresh points
of view to move communities

00:18:10.890 --> 00:18:12.000
forward.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:13.590
And most importantly,
there is always

00:18:13.590 --> 00:18:16.470
more work to be done for those
that are willing to do it.

00:18:16.470 --> 00:18:19.170
I think that blood quantum
or lineal descent has a role,

00:18:19.170 --> 00:18:21.600
but it's not the only factor
in defining tribal identity

00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:23.582
and citizenship for the future.

00:18:23.582 --> 00:18:26.040
I don't think the same answer
will be used for every tribe,

00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:28.950
as every tribe needs to decide,
ultimately, what its goals are.

00:18:28.950 --> 00:18:31.712
And its membership qualification
should reflect that.

00:18:31.712 --> 00:18:33.420
The original goal of
native blood quantum

00:18:33.420 --> 00:18:36.450
was explicitly to see the
disenrollment and demise

00:18:36.450 --> 00:18:38.364
of the legal status
of Native Americans.

00:18:38.364 --> 00:18:39.780
Which has likely
already succeeded

00:18:39.780 --> 00:18:41.240
from my personal bloodline.

00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:43.540
Which will end with me by
the quarter blood quantum

00:18:43.540 --> 00:18:45.894
standards we have in place now.

00:18:45.894 --> 00:18:48.060
I would like to see my
tribe's qualification methods

00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:49.024
change in my lifetime.

00:18:49.024 --> 00:18:50.940
And I believe we need
to create a process that

00:18:50.940 --> 00:18:53.520
can grow and change for
different generations,

00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:56.160
as the needs of our
communities change over time.

00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:58.380
However, as of now, I
only have more questions

00:18:58.380 --> 00:19:00.750
than answers unfortunately.

00:19:00.750 --> 00:19:03.360
As tribes themselves have
their own identity issues,

00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:04.810
are we a race?

00:19:04.810 --> 00:19:05.700
Are we a culture?

00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:09.180
A religion, a community, a
business, a nation, a family?

00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:10.710
Are we all at once?

00:19:10.710 --> 00:19:13.020
I would like to see membership
exist in different ways

00:19:13.020 --> 00:19:14.895
for tribes based on
their different functions

00:19:14.895 --> 00:19:15.910
in these areas.

00:19:15.910 --> 00:19:17.870
So there would be a
spectrum of citizenships.

00:19:17.870 --> 00:19:19.620
Could we have at least
two different types

00:19:19.620 --> 00:19:20.910
of membership statuses?

00:19:20.910 --> 00:19:23.970
One that is cultural and
another that is legal in nature?

00:19:23.970 --> 00:19:26.400
What would it take to have
both an inclusion of required

00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:29.580
cultural knowledge, similar
to a citizenship test, as well

00:19:29.580 --> 00:19:32.610
as other native blood included
and tribal qualifications?

00:19:32.610 --> 00:19:35.430
As for some natives, they
may come from eight or six

00:19:35.430 --> 00:19:37.737
different tribes, be
full blooded Indians,

00:19:37.737 --> 00:19:39.570
but not have enough for
any particular tribe

00:19:39.570 --> 00:19:40.920
to be enrolled.

00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:42.630
However, for pandemonium
blood quantum,

00:19:42.630 --> 00:19:45.060
tribes need to be careful that
tribal specificity was not

00:19:45.060 --> 00:19:46.849
eroded by a pan-indian identity.

00:19:46.849 --> 00:19:48.390
So we could create
a system that both

00:19:48.390 --> 00:19:52.800
unites us, but also preserves
our unique tribal differences.

00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:55.380
Even if membership policies
aren't changed in Oneida,

00:19:55.380 --> 00:19:57.360
I will raise my future
children as Oneidas,

00:19:57.360 --> 00:20:00.050
regardless of their
blood quantum.

00:20:00.050 --> 00:20:02.270
I believe that being Native
American and being Oneida

00:20:02.270 --> 00:20:05.150
is less about what we are
and more about what we do.

00:20:05.150 --> 00:20:07.070
Hona schoeni teachings
value decision

00:20:07.070 --> 00:20:09.530
making processes that consider
the impact of the next seven

00:20:09.530 --> 00:20:10.550
generations.

00:20:10.550 --> 00:20:12.980
And is something we
discuss often in Oneida.

00:20:12.980 --> 00:20:15.590
I am here today speaking
at Harvard because

00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:18.290
of the decisions that my
ancestors seven generations ago

00:20:18.290 --> 00:20:20.134
made to ensure our survival.

00:20:20.134 --> 00:20:21.800
It makes sense that
my children actually

00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:23.570
won't be enrolled
members, as I truly

00:20:23.570 --> 00:20:25.460
am the end of the
seventh generation.

00:20:25.460 --> 00:20:28.460
By the definitions that
we have been imposed on.

00:20:28.460 --> 00:20:30.050
That have been imposed on us.

00:20:30.050 --> 00:20:32.790
I am the end of blood
quantum for my bloodline.

00:20:32.790 --> 00:20:34.880
But in looking ahead, I
believe my future children

00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:37.250
will be the beginning of
the next seven generations.

00:20:37.250 --> 00:20:39.019
Which may not have
blood quantum,

00:20:39.019 --> 00:20:41.060
but hopefully they'll have
something much better.

00:20:41.060 --> 00:20:43.460
The ability to define,
decide, and grow Oneida

00:20:43.460 --> 00:20:46.490
into the future, based on
our own ideas of identity,

00:20:46.490 --> 00:20:48.770
for the survival of the
next seven generations.

00:20:48.770 --> 00:20:50.570
And I believe that is
something very much

00:20:50.570 --> 00:20:53.070
worth looking forward to.

00:20:53.070 --> 00:20:54.396
You're welcome.

00:21:07.730 --> 00:21:14.150
- [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:21:14.150 --> 00:21:17.420
My name is, English
name is Tesia Zientek.

00:21:17.420 --> 00:21:20.270
My Potawotamie name
given to me by my mother

00:21:20.270 --> 00:21:23.050
is Ji jacquie, which
means like a crane.

00:21:23.050 --> 00:21:24.680
Originally from
Shawnee, Oklahoma,

00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:29.204
and I'm a proud citizen of the
citizen Pottawatomie nation.

00:21:29.204 --> 00:21:30.620
As others have
said before me, I'm

00:21:30.620 --> 00:21:33.800
grateful today to be
standing before you

00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:37.130
on Pawtucket, Massachusetts,
Wampanoag land

00:21:37.130 --> 00:21:38.420
for the first time in my life.

00:21:38.420 --> 00:21:41.595
And I also am grateful
for the elders

00:21:41.595 --> 00:21:43.595
in the room who allow me
to speak on this topic.

00:21:46.740 --> 00:21:50.367
So before I share my thoughts
on tribal citizenship,

00:21:50.367 --> 00:21:52.200
I wanted to give you a
little bit of context

00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:54.540
of where I come from
both historically

00:21:54.540 --> 00:21:57.270
and geographically.

00:21:57.270 --> 00:21:59.970
The Pottawattamie
tribe as a whole

00:21:59.970 --> 00:22:02.040
originated in the Great
Lakes area of Canada

00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:03.660
and northern United States.

00:22:03.660 --> 00:22:06.330
But we were forcibly relocated
by several federal backed

00:22:06.330 --> 00:22:06.990
removals.

00:22:06.990 --> 00:22:10.470
You can see here,
the arrows in red

00:22:10.470 --> 00:22:13.650
are migrations that we
did of our own accord,

00:22:13.650 --> 00:22:20.904
and then the green are
were forcible removals.

00:22:20.904 --> 00:22:23.070
During the most devastating
of these removals, which

00:22:23.070 --> 00:22:27.570
we call the trail of death,
41 mostly women and children

00:22:27.570 --> 00:22:30.600
died along the way from our
woodlands homelands in Indiana

00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:31.590
to Northeast Kansas.

00:22:34.830 --> 00:22:37.922
After several broken
treaties and promises,

00:22:37.922 --> 00:22:40.005
the federal government
approached the Pottawatomie

00:22:40.005 --> 00:22:43.350
in 1861 with the
proposed treaty.

00:22:43.350 --> 00:22:45.060
The essence of that
document stated

00:22:45.060 --> 00:22:47.670
that instead of living
communally in Kansas,

00:22:47.670 --> 00:22:51.600
they would be private landowners
and United States citizens.

00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:54.570
My ancestors weren't forced
into signing the treaty

00:22:54.570 --> 00:22:57.630
or leaving the reservation,
but a difficult decision

00:22:57.630 --> 00:23:00.660
faced them at that time
and under those conditions.

00:23:00.660 --> 00:23:03.450
Having already tried to
resist removal and live

00:23:03.450 --> 00:23:05.730
through the aftermath
of the failed attempt,

00:23:05.730 --> 00:23:09.960
and watch their children and
mothers and relatives pass

00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:15.030
away, they opted to try a new
legal and political strategy

00:23:15.030 --> 00:23:18.390
in hopes of gaining security for
themselves and their families.

00:23:18.390 --> 00:23:22.290
2/3 of those on the reservation
opted to sign the treaty.

00:23:22.290 --> 00:23:26.010
And they became ultimately known
as the citizen Pottawatomie

00:23:26.010 --> 00:23:28.770
And the rest who stayed
on the communal lands

00:23:28.770 --> 00:23:32.700
are now known as the
prairie band Pottawatomie.

00:23:32.700 --> 00:23:35.160
Many promises, again,
were made about what

00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:37.020
it meant to be a
citizen and a landowner.

00:23:37.020 --> 00:23:39.570
They were told that they would,
that the citizen Pottawatomie

00:23:39.570 --> 00:23:40.500
would have a census.

00:23:40.500 --> 00:23:42.120
That they would be
able to survey the land

00:23:42.120 --> 00:23:43.495
and then the tribal
members would

00:23:43.495 --> 00:23:46.227
be able to choose which
plot of land they wanted.

00:23:46.227 --> 00:23:48.060
Tribal members are
supposed to receive money

00:23:48.060 --> 00:23:49.710
to buy seed and
farming equipment

00:23:49.710 --> 00:23:51.930
to have two full seasons
of crop production

00:23:51.930 --> 00:23:53.490
as a means of income.

00:23:53.490 --> 00:23:55.590
And then after those two
years, the government

00:23:55.590 --> 00:23:58.770
would determine who was worthy
and eligible to be US citizens.

00:23:58.770 --> 00:24:02.220
And those ready for
citizenship would be taxed.

00:24:02.220 --> 00:24:06.120
Spoiler alert, that is not
how it played out at all.

00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:09.270
My ancestors were taxed
almost immediately,

00:24:09.270 --> 00:24:12.690
but had no source of income
and therefore couldn't pay.

00:24:12.690 --> 00:24:16.440
So they were citizens in
name, but not in practice.

00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:17.940
The federal government
took the land

00:24:17.940 --> 00:24:21.540
of those people who
failed to pay their taxes.

00:24:21.540 --> 00:24:24.810
And then six years later, the
citizen Pottawatomie nation

00:24:24.810 --> 00:24:28.260
negotiated another treaty,
the Treaty of 1867.

00:24:28.260 --> 00:24:30.710
Which allowed tribal members
to return their allotments

00:24:30.710 --> 00:24:32.760
back to the federal
government, which were then

00:24:32.760 --> 00:24:36.360
sold to the Atchison Topeka
and Santa Fe railroad company.

00:24:36.360 --> 00:24:38.850
And those proceeds
were used to purchase

00:24:38.850 --> 00:24:40.710
the citizen Pottawatomie
nation's land

00:24:40.710 --> 00:24:42.690
and Indian territory.

00:24:42.690 --> 00:24:44.730
Which is now known as Oklahoma.

00:24:44.730 --> 00:24:48.810
So that migration from
Kansas to present day

00:24:48.810 --> 00:24:51.780
Oklahoma began in the 1870s.

00:24:51.780 --> 00:24:55.320
Of course, the promises
were yet again broken,

00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:58.740
and just two decades later in
1890, the federal government

00:24:58.740 --> 00:25:02.130
derailed those
efforts to relocate

00:25:02.130 --> 00:25:04.170
through the Dawes Act of 1887.

00:25:04.170 --> 00:25:07.770
Which that act dictated that
the citizen Pottawatomie accept

00:25:07.770 --> 00:25:10.440
individual allotments of land.

00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:12.660
And the lands that
remain un allotted,

00:25:12.660 --> 00:25:14.020
were classified as surplus.

00:25:14.020 --> 00:25:20.270
This is land, as you remember,
that my ancestors purchased.

00:25:20.270 --> 00:25:22.890
So the unallotted
land, that surplus,

00:25:22.890 --> 00:25:25.470
was opened up for non
Indian settlements.

00:25:25.470 --> 00:25:28.450
And more than half of the
original 900 square mile

00:25:28.450 --> 00:25:30.240
citizen Pottawatomie
reservation,

00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:33.600
approximately 300,000
acres essentially

00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:34.720
disappeared overnight.

00:25:37.410 --> 00:25:39.470
Today, the citizen
Pottawatomie nation

00:25:39.470 --> 00:25:41.690
is one of nine bands
of Pottawatomie,

00:25:41.690 --> 00:25:43.910
with two first
nations in Canada,

00:25:43.910 --> 00:25:47.840
and seven throughout
the United States.

00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:49.670
The citizen Pottawatomie
nation is still

00:25:49.670 --> 00:25:52.630
headquartered in Shawnee
Oklahoma, in central Oklahoma.

00:25:52.630 --> 00:25:55.280
But our over 33,000
tribal citizens

00:25:55.280 --> 00:25:59.210
live in each of the 50 states,
as well as internationally.

00:25:59.210 --> 00:26:01.310
As a result of commitment
to self-governance,

00:26:01.310 --> 00:26:03.560
stable leadership, and an
innovative constitutional

00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:05.450
reform, the citizen
Pottawatomie nation

00:26:05.450 --> 00:26:09.470
has not only
survived, but thrived.

00:26:09.470 --> 00:26:11.270
So now that you
have some context,

00:26:11.270 --> 00:26:13.220
I want to jump to
a two decade period

00:26:13.220 --> 00:26:16.370
from the last century that had
a huge impact on the tribe we

00:26:16.370 --> 00:26:18.210
are today.

00:26:18.210 --> 00:26:20.210
Let me pause here for a
moment and acknowledge

00:26:20.210 --> 00:26:22.980
as Olivia did, that every
tribe is a sovereign nation.

00:26:22.980 --> 00:26:24.750
With the ability
to determine how

00:26:24.750 --> 00:26:27.540
their membership
laws are set up.

00:26:27.540 --> 00:26:29.640
So the citizenship story
I'm telling today is how

00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:31.973
the citizen Pottawatomie
nation decided what worked best

00:26:31.973 --> 00:26:34.650
for them, and cannot simply be
transferred to the unique needs

00:26:34.650 --> 00:26:35.910
of another tribal nation.

00:26:35.910 --> 00:26:39.030
Because context does matter.

00:26:39.030 --> 00:26:43.080
On the screen, you're
seeing Article two

00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:46.832
from a 1961 amendment to
our tribal constitution.

00:26:46.832 --> 00:26:49.290
In particular, I want to draw
your attention to the portion

00:26:49.290 --> 00:26:53.700
circled in red, which is Section
one letter D of this article.

00:26:53.700 --> 00:26:55.410
In which our tribal
council proposed

00:26:55.410 --> 00:26:56.910
that we move our
tribal enrollment

00:26:56.910 --> 00:27:00.210
criteria to limit membership
to anyone with a minimum blood

00:27:00.210 --> 00:27:03.310
degree of 1/8th.

00:27:03.310 --> 00:27:06.440
Exactly 100 years
after our ancestors

00:27:06.440 --> 00:27:10.100
opted for a drastic
citizenship change,

00:27:10.100 --> 00:27:14.690
the tribe voted 101 for and
8 against this amendment.

00:27:14.690 --> 00:27:17.330
And it was approved by the
US secretary of the interior

00:27:17.330 --> 00:27:20.120
on April 24th, 1961.

00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:21.490
I think it bears repeating.

00:27:21.490 --> 00:27:24.710
109 people and a non
Pottawatomie bureaucrat

00:27:24.710 --> 00:27:26.460
decided the fate of
our tribal nation.

00:27:29.952 --> 00:27:32.410
So in case you're wondering
what an eighth looks like, it's

00:27:32.410 --> 00:27:34.810
the small yellow wedge here.

00:27:34.810 --> 00:27:37.570
Much like thoroughbred
horses, tribal citizens

00:27:37.570 --> 00:27:39.310
had to prove their
pedigree in a way

00:27:39.310 --> 00:27:41.620
that they had never
had to do before.

00:27:41.620 --> 00:27:44.200
This wasn't part of our
traditional history.

00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:46.480
The decision at that
time was due to a desire

00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:48.070
to limit the number
of recipients

00:27:48.070 --> 00:27:50.260
of tribal per capita payments.

00:27:50.260 --> 00:27:52.360
Fewer citizen Pottawatomie
tribal members

00:27:52.360 --> 00:27:55.270
meant more money per person.

00:27:55.270 --> 00:27:57.970
Unfortunately, the
science of blood quantum

00:27:57.970 --> 00:28:01.600
can be inexact at best,
and problematic at worst.

00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:04.150
I've heard stories of
Indian agents recording

00:28:04.150 --> 00:28:06.730
different blood quantum
amounts for siblings, simply

00:28:06.730 --> 00:28:08.290
due to their appearance.

00:28:08.290 --> 00:28:11.050
When one sibling spent more
time outside that summer,

00:28:11.050 --> 00:28:14.410
he or she would be noted as more
Pottawatomie than their brother

00:28:14.410 --> 00:28:16.210
or sister.

00:28:16.210 --> 00:28:18.790
When I think about how much
my make up foundation color

00:28:18.790 --> 00:28:21.310
changes between
summer and winter,

00:28:21.310 --> 00:28:23.530
this makes me cringe
at how inaccurate

00:28:23.530 --> 00:28:26.230
the starting data could be.

00:28:26.230 --> 00:28:28.510
And if a citizen believed
that this record was wrong,

00:28:28.510 --> 00:28:30.240
the burden of proof was on them.

00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:31.940
Which could be an
impossible task,

00:28:31.940 --> 00:28:33.850
especially if several
years, or even

00:28:33.850 --> 00:28:39.040
decades, had passed since
the original error was made.

00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:40.480
But the amendment passed.

00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:42.690
And it stood for the
next two decades.

00:28:42.690 --> 00:28:46.120
In the late 1980s, our
current tribal chairman,

00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:48.520
John Rocky Barrett, and
other tribal leaders

00:28:48.520 --> 00:28:50.830
began to challenge
this way of thinking.

00:28:50.830 --> 00:28:53.170
They argued that it was
in-authentic to our traditional

00:28:53.170 --> 00:28:55.930
values to reduce our
tribal citizenship

00:28:55.930 --> 00:28:57.880
connection to faulty records.

00:28:57.880 --> 00:29:00.100
Moreover, since
blood quantum wasn't

00:29:00.100 --> 00:29:01.630
a traditionally
Pottawatomie policy,

00:29:01.630 --> 00:29:03.460
then where did it come from?

00:29:03.460 --> 00:29:06.040
It began in practice following
the Indian Reorganization

00:29:06.040 --> 00:29:09.670
Act of 1934, which aimed to
curb the destructive allotment

00:29:09.670 --> 00:29:10.630
process.

00:29:10.630 --> 00:29:12.130
One of the byproducts
of that law

00:29:12.130 --> 00:29:15.257
was establishing
citizenship standards.

00:29:15.257 --> 00:29:16.840
I, along with many
others, would argue

00:29:16.840 --> 00:29:19.180
that this was another
tool of assimilation.

00:29:19.180 --> 00:29:21.850
As fewer people could lay
claim to being Pottawatomie,

00:29:21.850 --> 00:29:24.100
it wouldn't be too long until
the citizen Pottawatomie

00:29:24.100 --> 00:29:26.200
nation ceased to exist at all.

00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:28.840
Which aligned quite neatly
with determination policies

00:29:28.840 --> 00:29:30.610
of that era.

00:29:30.610 --> 00:29:33.880
If that was the goal it
was certainly working.

00:29:33.880 --> 00:29:36.970
By 1988, the citizen
Pottawatomie nation

00:29:36.970 --> 00:29:41.200
had diminished to around
5,000 tribal members.

00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:43.300
Due to blood quantum
restrictions,

00:29:43.300 --> 00:29:45.970
the tribe was also
growing steadily older.

00:29:45.970 --> 00:29:48.940
The average age of the
tribal members at that time

00:29:48.940 --> 00:29:51.610
was 45 or 45 years old.

00:29:51.610 --> 00:29:53.230
44 or 45 years old.

00:29:53.230 --> 00:29:54.970
And very few
member's descendants

00:29:54.970 --> 00:29:58.170
met the blood degree
requirements to enroll.

00:29:58.170 --> 00:30:01.060
The rule was literally
disrupting family dynamics.

00:30:01.060 --> 00:30:03.010
As you'll see in the
letter in the slide,

00:30:03.010 --> 00:30:05.830
a tribal member writes that
due to the year of her birth,

00:30:05.830 --> 00:30:07.750
she was the only
person in her family

00:30:07.750 --> 00:30:09.190
not to be considered
Pottawatomie

00:30:09.190 --> 00:30:10.792
according to their roles.

00:30:10.792 --> 00:30:13.000
She pleaded with the Bureau
of Indian Affairs officer

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:16.640
to reconsider, but her requests,
like that of so many others,

00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:17.140
was denied.

00:30:20.220 --> 00:30:21.620
However, there is still hope.

00:30:21.620 --> 00:30:23.420
As chairman Barrett
preaches to this day,

00:30:23.420 --> 00:30:25.820
if you're not in the business
of constitutional reform,

00:30:25.820 --> 00:30:28.790
you're not in the business
of tribal sovereignty.

00:30:28.790 --> 00:30:31.600
So he and others proposed
another constitutional

00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:34.990
amendment to change the
enrollment criteria yet again.

00:30:34.990 --> 00:30:36.070
And it passed.

00:30:36.070 --> 00:30:43.072
In 1989, the tribe voted 1,919
into 343 to open the rolls.

00:30:43.072 --> 00:30:45.280
You might notice that there
was a much larger turnout

00:30:45.280 --> 00:30:48.280
for this election
than the one in 1961.

00:30:48.280 --> 00:30:50.290
Families have quite
literally been ripped apart

00:30:50.290 --> 00:30:52.690
as a result of
the 1961 decision.

00:30:52.690 --> 00:30:55.270
And people were
eager to reverse it.

00:30:55.270 --> 00:30:57.580
Under the new
amendment, anyone who

00:30:57.580 --> 00:31:01.420
was descended from someone on
the January 1937 tribal rolls

00:31:01.420 --> 00:31:04.980
could submit an
enrollment application.

00:31:04.980 --> 00:31:07.420
And this is the same system
that we have in place today.

00:31:07.420 --> 00:31:09.660
And our membership
continues to grow.

00:31:09.660 --> 00:31:11.940
Now, instead of small
per capita payments

00:31:11.940 --> 00:31:14.460
given to each tribal member,
we invest tribal revenue

00:31:14.460 --> 00:31:16.650
back into services so
that each tribal member

00:31:16.650 --> 00:31:20.130
can receive scholarships, health
care, and hardship assistance,

00:31:20.130 --> 00:31:23.080
among countless other services.

00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:25.160
But history is made
up of living people.

00:31:25.160 --> 00:31:27.460
And in my opinion, none
of this means anything

00:31:27.460 --> 00:31:30.160
unless you can truly understand
the impact of these citizenship

00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:32.890
policies on a family
and personal level.

00:31:32.890 --> 00:31:35.360
So I'd like to share
my own story with you.

00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:37.060
I have to confess,
because blood quantum

00:31:37.060 --> 00:31:40.300
is a policy I vehemently
oppose myself,

00:31:40.300 --> 00:31:42.554
it is something that
I rarely discuss.

00:31:42.554 --> 00:31:44.470
When people find out
that I'm native American,

00:31:44.470 --> 00:31:46.690
the first question
that they typically ask

00:31:46.690 --> 00:31:49.287
is, how much are you?

00:31:49.287 --> 00:31:50.870
As a side note, this
is not a question

00:31:50.870 --> 00:31:54.320
that I hear asked towards other
heritages or nationalities.

00:31:54.320 --> 00:31:57.729
On st. Patrick's Day, on
Saturday, for example,

00:31:57.729 --> 00:31:59.270
thousands of people
throughout the US

00:31:59.270 --> 00:32:00.920
celebrated their
heritage wearing

00:32:00.920 --> 00:32:03.410
among other things, shirts
that read, kiss me I'm Irish.

00:32:03.410 --> 00:32:07.820
And I didn't hear anyone
asking them how much they were.

00:32:07.820 --> 00:32:09.530
No, when people ask
me how much are you,

00:32:09.530 --> 00:32:11.402
I just don't answer
the question.

00:32:11.402 --> 00:32:12.860
This is partially
because I view it

00:32:12.860 --> 00:32:15.500
as a learning opportunity
for the person asking,

00:32:15.500 --> 00:32:18.410
but also because I do not have
my blood quantum memorized.

00:32:18.410 --> 00:32:21.020
It is simply not important to
me to validate my tribe life

00:32:21.020 --> 00:32:22.980
Indian this way.

00:32:22.980 --> 00:32:25.580
However, while preparing
for this presentation,

00:32:25.580 --> 00:32:29.230
I pulled out my certificate of
Indian blood, CDIB card, that

00:32:29.230 --> 00:32:31.610
was issued by the Bureau
of Indian Affairs,

00:32:31.610 --> 00:32:33.800
again a unique aspect to
Native American identity.

00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:37.940
I didn't meet any card carrying
Irish people this weekend.

00:32:37.940 --> 00:32:41.750
I checked the number on the card
and I did some family research.

00:32:41.750 --> 00:32:43.370
I called our tribal
rolls department,

00:32:43.370 --> 00:32:45.320
I pulled up some old
family tree records,

00:32:45.320 --> 00:32:46.840
and I spoke to my grandma.

00:32:46.840 --> 00:32:47.490
And the story.

00:32:47.490 --> 00:32:48.960
I learned blew my mind.

00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:51.520
So I invite you to join
me down the rabbit hole

00:32:51.520 --> 00:32:55.780
that I discovered
this past few weeks.

00:32:55.780 --> 00:32:58.030
So up here on the screen is
my recorded blood quantum.

00:33:01.700 --> 00:33:05.060
For context, that's
what that equates to.

00:33:05.060 --> 00:33:09.500
9 over 512 does not
roll off the tongue.

00:33:09.500 --> 00:33:11.870
And I guarantee if I
told anyone asking me

00:33:11.870 --> 00:33:14.270
how much I was, I would
be laughed out of town

00:33:14.270 --> 00:33:16.100
or immediately dismissed.

00:33:16.100 --> 00:33:18.950
But that's where the
story gets interesting.

00:33:18.950 --> 00:33:20.450
I called our tribal
rolls department

00:33:20.450 --> 00:33:22.490
with the intent of
finding out at what point

00:33:22.490 --> 00:33:24.890
my family would have been
ineligible to enroll based

00:33:24.890 --> 00:33:27.810
on the 1/8th rule of 1961.

00:33:27.810 --> 00:33:30.050
I learned that according
to our tribal records,

00:33:30.050 --> 00:33:32.870
I would need to go back six
generations to Josephine Wells

00:33:32.870 --> 00:33:35.516
to find anyone in our family
who was at least an eighth.

00:33:35.516 --> 00:33:36.890
And this puzzled
me a little bit,

00:33:36.890 --> 00:33:39.395
because my great
grandfather, Atwin Blaze

00:33:39.395 --> 00:33:41.810
Pecor served as tribal
chairman for several years.

00:33:41.810 --> 00:33:44.450
And my mother had been eligible
to receive per capita payments

00:33:44.450 --> 00:33:47.270
before I was born, during the
period in which the 1/8th rule

00:33:47.270 --> 00:33:48.380
was in place.

00:33:48.380 --> 00:33:50.270
So how could the
tribes own chairman

00:33:50.270 --> 00:33:51.860
not meet the requirements?

00:33:51.860 --> 00:33:53.930
And how could my mother
receive those benefits,

00:33:53.930 --> 00:33:56.956
if she didn't meet
that criteria?

00:33:56.956 --> 00:33:58.580
So after some digging
I found a history

00:33:58.580 --> 00:33:59.610
of our constitutional
amendments,

00:33:59.610 --> 00:34:01.640
and I learned the one
eighth rule of 1961

00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:04.430
allowed anybody enrolled
before the amendment passed

00:34:04.430 --> 00:34:05.597
to be grandfathered in.

00:34:05.597 --> 00:34:07.430
And that's how my family
stayed on the rolls

00:34:07.430 --> 00:34:08.870
for several generations.

00:34:08.870 --> 00:34:11.210
My mother, born in
1959, was enrolled

00:34:11.210 --> 00:34:14.030
by her parents in
1960, just in time

00:34:14.030 --> 00:34:17.919
to miss the 1961 addition of
the blood quantum criterion.

00:34:17.919 --> 00:34:19.460
And then I called
my mother last week

00:34:19.460 --> 00:34:22.024
to tell her how lucky
her timing had been.

00:34:22.024 --> 00:34:23.690
She suggested that I
call my grandmother

00:34:23.690 --> 00:34:26.960
to hear her side of the story.

00:34:26.960 --> 00:34:27.739
So I did.

00:34:27.739 --> 00:34:29.420
And here's what she told me.

00:34:29.420 --> 00:34:32.480
So even before
1961, our tribe had

00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:37.190
a semblance of blood quantum
requirements in place.

00:34:37.190 --> 00:34:39.380
While descendents could
enroll, certain services,

00:34:39.380 --> 00:34:41.630
including scholarships,
were reserved for those

00:34:41.630 --> 00:34:43.969
with a higher blood quantum.

00:34:43.969 --> 00:34:46.489
As tribal chairman,
my great grandfather

00:34:46.489 --> 00:34:49.530
made an enemy of the person
who oversaw tribal records.

00:34:49.530 --> 00:34:51.889
We don't know why,
but it happened.

00:34:51.889 --> 00:34:55.040
In addition, according to
the kind of juicy gossip

00:34:55.040 --> 00:34:56.480
that I'm sure
every family holds,

00:34:56.480 --> 00:34:59.090
my grandma beat the tribal
enrollment officer's daughter

00:34:59.090 --> 00:35:01.910
to be elected president of
the Catholic women's club.

00:35:01.910 --> 00:35:04.010
And she won the
heart of my grandpa.

00:35:04.010 --> 00:35:06.710
And in revenge, and to
prevent my great grandfather's

00:35:06.710 --> 00:35:09.530
children-- my grandparents--
from receiving those services,

00:35:09.530 --> 00:35:13.340
the tribal enrollment
officer modified the records.

00:35:13.340 --> 00:35:18.680
She decreased Atwin Blaze
Pecor's blood quantum to 164.

00:35:18.680 --> 00:35:21.629
And in case you're wondering,
I did fact check the story,

00:35:21.629 --> 00:35:22.670
and the records bear now.

00:35:22.670 --> 00:35:24.660
This is not a family myth.

00:35:24.660 --> 00:35:28.190
You can see the erasure
marks on some of the records.

00:35:28.190 --> 00:35:30.080
Currently on the
Sepian tribal rolls,

00:35:30.080 --> 00:35:33.410
my great grandfather's blood
quantum is listed as 164.

00:35:33.410 --> 00:35:34.821
Because of that change.

00:35:34.821 --> 00:35:37.070
Now bonus points if you're
paying attention and notice

00:35:37.070 --> 00:35:39.650
that the official
trial record from 1967,

00:35:39.650 --> 00:35:42.290
even with its hand
written modifications,

00:35:42.290 --> 00:35:45.070
has a different number
for Atwin Blaze Pecor, AB

00:35:45.070 --> 00:35:46.580
Pecor, my great grandpa.

00:35:46.580 --> 00:35:49.640
You'll also see that names of
Josephine Wells and Margaret

00:35:49.640 --> 00:35:53.042
Ogee all circled in red, but
there are handwritten changes.

00:35:53.042 --> 00:35:54.500
And there is an
asterisk that notes

00:35:54.500 --> 00:35:56.916
that there are some questions
of the accuracy of the blood

00:35:56.916 --> 00:36:01.280
degree and that it could change
if the Logan records are found.

00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:03.920
And if that confuses
you, and it confused me,

00:36:03.920 --> 00:36:06.500
take a look at this
alternate record.

00:36:06.500 --> 00:36:09.950
Which lists my grandfather's
blood degree as 964.

00:36:09.950 --> 00:36:12.110
both of these came from
our tribal rolls department

00:36:12.110 --> 00:36:13.020
this past week.

00:36:13.020 --> 00:36:14.760
Our official records.

00:36:14.760 --> 00:36:16.400
These are the type
of imperfect records

00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:20.960
that so many tribes rely
on today for citizenship.

00:36:20.960 --> 00:36:22.490
Thoroughly confused
at this point,

00:36:22.490 --> 00:36:24.080
I asked my grandmother
if she knows,

00:36:24.080 --> 00:36:26.480
based on our family history,
what our blood quantum was

00:36:26.480 --> 00:36:29.570
before the vengeful eraser of
the tribal enrollment officer

00:36:29.570 --> 00:36:30.325
struck.

00:36:30.325 --> 00:36:32.450
She said that there was
certainty within the family

00:36:32.450 --> 00:36:34.640
that my great, great,
great grandparents had each

00:36:34.640 --> 00:36:36.320
been half Pottawatomie.

00:36:36.320 --> 00:36:37.800
Which would have
made each of them,

00:36:37.800 --> 00:36:40.950
each of their children half
and my grandfather quarter.

00:36:40.950 --> 00:36:45.102
With the strike of a pencil he
went from a quarter to 1/64th.

00:36:45.102 --> 00:36:47.310
And my great grandfather
didn't take this development

00:36:47.310 --> 00:36:48.900
lying down, by the way.

00:36:48.900 --> 00:36:52.080
A family farm hand who had
been present at my great,

00:36:52.080 --> 00:36:56.220
great grandmother's birth,
testified of her blood degree.

00:36:56.220 --> 00:36:58.740
And in his '90s, mailed a
notarized letter to this effect

00:36:58.740 --> 00:37:01.500
to the Bureau of Indian
Affairs in Washington DC.

00:37:01.500 --> 00:37:03.600
I'm not sure how many
cynics of bureaucracy

00:37:03.600 --> 00:37:06.660
are in the room today, but
surely at least a few of you

00:37:06.660 --> 00:37:08.590
aren't surprised
what happened next.

00:37:08.590 --> 00:37:13.440
This notarized letter,
the only copy, got lost.

00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:15.940
So after Mr. Bertrand,
the farmhand, passed away,

00:37:15.940 --> 00:37:18.250
there was no recourse to
pursue changing the record.

00:37:21.200 --> 00:37:22.700
And to further
complicate the story,

00:37:22.700 --> 00:37:24.890
I had always been told that
my great grandmother was also

00:37:24.890 --> 00:37:25.490
Pottawatomie.

00:37:25.490 --> 00:37:28.430
When I asked the tribal rolls
specialist on the phone what

00:37:28.430 --> 00:37:30.972
her blood quantum was, she
replied with some confusion

00:37:30.972 --> 00:37:32.930
that there was a question
mark next to her name

00:37:32.930 --> 00:37:34.496
in the official records.

00:37:34.496 --> 00:37:35.870
According to my
grandma, this was

00:37:35.870 --> 00:37:37.459
because she knew she
was Pottawatomie,

00:37:37.459 --> 00:37:39.500
but was unable to prove
it because her mother had

00:37:39.500 --> 00:37:42.880
been disowned by her parents.

00:37:42.880 --> 00:37:45.879
So why am I telling you
all of this family drama?

00:37:45.879 --> 00:37:47.920
What does any of it have
to do with today's topic

00:37:47.920 --> 00:37:49.700
of tribal citizenship?

00:37:49.700 --> 00:37:52.240
You see, had our tribe
maintained the one eighth blood

00:37:52.240 --> 00:37:54.970
degree minimum requirement
in acts of 1961.

00:37:54.970 --> 00:37:57.040
Even despite all the
inaccurate records

00:37:57.040 --> 00:37:58.840
our blood degree
is based off of,

00:37:58.840 --> 00:38:03.070
my mother would have slipped
by just in time to enroll.

00:38:03.070 --> 00:38:04.690
But I wouldn't have.

00:38:04.690 --> 00:38:08.290
Although I was born in 1986,
I couldn't enroll after 1989

00:38:08.290 --> 00:38:10.300
when the rolls opened up.

00:38:10.300 --> 00:38:12.580
My mother enrolled me in 1995.

00:38:12.580 --> 00:38:15.340
Despite knowing since I could
talk that I was Pottawatomie,

00:38:15.340 --> 00:38:17.500
I was this close to losing
that piece of identity

00:38:17.500 --> 00:38:18.850
in the legal sense.

00:38:18.850 --> 00:38:22.647
Our legacy as a Pottawatomie
family would've ended with me.

00:38:22.647 --> 00:38:24.730
I wanted to include the
side by side photo of what

00:38:24.730 --> 00:38:26.380
is now my grandma's house.

00:38:26.380 --> 00:38:28.930
This house sits on my
family's tribal allotment

00:38:28.930 --> 00:38:31.946
land, which we still own
the majority of and live on.

00:38:31.946 --> 00:38:34.070
The house was built before
Oklahoma became a state.

00:38:34.070 --> 00:38:36.940
And as you can see, the
house looks almost identical.

00:38:36.940 --> 00:38:39.920
Last year we gathered my
grandparents, aunts, uncles,

00:38:39.920 --> 00:38:41.410
and cousins for a photo shoot.

00:38:41.410 --> 00:38:43.570
It's hard to see, even
though my great grandparents

00:38:43.570 --> 00:38:47.270
made an appearance
in some portraits.

00:38:47.270 --> 00:38:49.056
In this photo, nine
of my family members

00:38:49.056 --> 00:38:51.430
either worked for the tribe
currently or retired from it.

00:38:51.430 --> 00:38:53.590
Three of us, myself
included, currently hold

00:38:53.590 --> 00:38:55.870
leadership positions as
department directors.

00:38:55.870 --> 00:38:58.750
We attend cultural
events regularly.

00:38:58.750 --> 00:39:00.910
In short, we take our
identities very seriously

00:39:00.910 --> 00:39:03.243
and have dedicated our lives
to maintaining the strength

00:39:03.243 --> 00:39:04.670
of our tribal nation.

00:39:04.670 --> 00:39:06.170
What I'm trying to say is this.

00:39:06.170 --> 00:39:09.190
The crazy messed up records
don't change any of that.

00:39:09.190 --> 00:39:12.550
Even if they were correct,
none of that would change.

00:39:12.550 --> 00:39:14.290
We are Pottawatomie
because our ancestors

00:39:14.290 --> 00:39:16.248
survived the trail of
death, and are resilient,

00:39:16.248 --> 00:39:18.520
despite many efforts
to wipe them out.

00:39:18.520 --> 00:39:21.490
We are Pottawatomie because
stories, traditions, houses,

00:39:21.490 --> 00:39:24.650
and even lands have been
passed through the generations.

00:39:24.650 --> 00:39:27.400
We are Pottawatomie because
of who we are as a family,

00:39:27.400 --> 00:39:29.260
and how each of us were raised.

00:39:29.260 --> 00:39:32.560
No yellow sliver will
ever change that.

00:39:32.560 --> 00:39:35.675
When I say [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH],,
or I am Pottawatomie,

00:39:35.675 --> 00:39:37.550
like I did at the start
of this presentation,

00:39:37.550 --> 00:39:38.950
there is no qualifier.

00:39:38.950 --> 00:39:42.520
I do not say I am part
Pottawatomie, because I'm not.

00:39:42.520 --> 00:39:45.070
My tribe as a sovereign
nation has enrolled me

00:39:45.070 --> 00:39:47.560
as a citizen based on a
constitutional decision.

00:39:47.560 --> 00:39:50.020
My family has accepted me as
Pottawatomie citizen based

00:39:50.020 --> 00:39:51.490
on our heritage and history.

00:39:51.490 --> 00:39:53.050
And it's as simple as that.

00:39:53.050 --> 00:39:55.139
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:40:09.330 --> 00:40:12.930
- I was enrolled last week
as a full blood pirate.

00:40:16.590 --> 00:40:18.640
So I have my card and
so if anybody wants

00:40:18.640 --> 00:40:20.970
to check my lineage, you can.

00:40:23.870 --> 00:40:28.265
It's not Halloween, and I'm
trying to figure out what's up.

00:40:28.265 --> 00:40:30.140
So in terms of we talked
about blood quantum,

00:40:30.140 --> 00:40:32.455
as you look at the picture.

00:40:32.455 --> 00:40:33.830
You don't need to
be a math major

00:40:33.830 --> 00:40:39.570
to figure out where this goes.

00:40:39.570 --> 00:40:42.500
And just a little
bit about the book

00:40:42.500 --> 00:40:45.960
is that, when I saw the
cartoon by Marty Tubles, who

00:40:45.960 --> 00:40:47.270
was a cartoonist.

00:40:47.270 --> 00:40:51.330
I said, there's a book
behind that cartoon.

00:40:51.330 --> 00:40:54.614
And then I went and
found a publisher

00:40:54.614 --> 00:40:56.780
who said they would publish
the book if we wrote it.

00:40:56.780 --> 00:41:00.030
And so before one word
was written we had a book.

00:41:00.030 --> 00:41:03.380
And we did it in an anthology.

00:41:03.380 --> 00:41:07.190
We had 24 writers
from across the world.

00:41:07.190 --> 00:41:10.400
If you think about doing
an anthology, don't.

00:41:10.400 --> 00:41:13.910
Nobody ever meets a deadline.

00:41:13.910 --> 00:41:15.710
But nonetheless, we have a book.

00:41:15.710 --> 00:41:20.922
And this is called The
Great Vanishing Act Blood

00:41:20.922 --> 00:41:22.630
Quantum and the Future
of Native Nations.

00:41:22.630 --> 00:41:25.240
So this affects really
hundreds of tribes.

00:41:25.240 --> 00:41:27.270
And it's important
for tribes to have

00:41:27.270 --> 00:41:31.590
a conversation about who
they are, who decides,

00:41:31.590 --> 00:41:32.610
how did we do this.

00:41:32.610 --> 00:41:35.150
And the Pottawatomie
certainly have done that.

00:41:35.150 --> 00:41:38.880
And our tribe is sort of
engaged at this point,

00:41:38.880 --> 00:41:41.070
they're avoiding the topic.

00:41:41.070 --> 00:41:46.950
So I knew Olivia's family for
four generations, you know.

00:41:46.950 --> 00:41:50.260
And she's got the longevity
genes in her family.

00:41:50.260 --> 00:41:54.270
So I expect she'll be
around for a while.

00:41:54.270 --> 00:41:57.690
But she kind of knew where she
was going when she was small.

00:41:57.690 --> 00:42:00.030
She wanted to leave, and
then she would come back.

00:42:00.030 --> 00:42:03.150
So I expect you to be tribal
chair one of these days,

00:42:03.150 --> 00:42:08.420
and make all your mistakes at
Google and then come back home.

00:42:08.420 --> 00:42:11.850
But she was also Miss Oneida, I
still think she's Miss Oneida.

00:42:11.850 --> 00:42:14.350
It was 2015, huh?

00:42:14.350 --> 00:42:15.000
14.

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:16.060
See, time flies.

00:42:16.060 --> 00:42:17.070
Yeah.

00:42:17.070 --> 00:42:21.040
I want to say Megan was Miss
baby Oneida when she was three.

00:42:21.040 --> 00:42:21.930
Some of you know her.

00:42:21.930 --> 00:42:23.010
Yeah.

00:42:23.010 --> 00:42:25.380
Yeah.

00:42:25.380 --> 00:42:28.080
She reminded me of
a Van Morrison song.

00:42:28.080 --> 00:42:30.750
Brown sugar so we
used to call her that.

00:42:30.750 --> 00:42:31.880
She was walking around.

00:42:31.880 --> 00:42:33.570
But when she was
about nine years old,

00:42:33.570 --> 00:42:36.750
I worked at the University
of Colorado in Boulder.

00:42:36.750 --> 00:42:39.580
And I dragged her along
to meetings and so.

00:42:39.580 --> 00:42:43.590
We'd be at some remote
place on campus.

00:42:43.590 --> 00:42:46.350
Then I'd say, I'll race
you back to the office.

00:42:46.350 --> 00:42:48.570
But I took a different
path than she did,

00:42:48.570 --> 00:42:51.000
and she was always beating
me back to the office.

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:54.570
And I tried to lose her several
times, and I couldn't do it.

00:42:54.570 --> 00:42:57.530
And she says, you know,
when I come to school here,

00:42:57.530 --> 00:42:59.430
well I have to go on the tour.

00:42:59.430 --> 00:43:01.110
I says, you'll
probably give the tour

00:43:01.110 --> 00:43:03.570
when you're before your role.

00:43:03.570 --> 00:43:07.350
So she know a lot
about that campus.

00:43:07.350 --> 00:43:09.840
So I'm really proud of her work.

00:43:09.840 --> 00:43:12.250
She has a better Rolodex
than I have at this point.

00:43:12.250 --> 00:43:14.344
And which is wonderful.

00:43:17.250 --> 00:43:22.300
When I first got
into higher education

00:43:22.300 --> 00:43:25.930
I had a group interview with
a number of white faculty

00:43:25.930 --> 00:43:26.770
members.

00:43:26.770 --> 00:43:28.930
And the first question,
one of the first questions

00:43:28.930 --> 00:43:32.740
they asked me saying,
why are you an Indian?

00:43:32.740 --> 00:43:34.570
And I sort of was shocked.

00:43:34.570 --> 00:43:36.656
Because nobody's ever
asked me that question.

00:43:36.656 --> 00:43:38.030
And I quickly
responded and said,

00:43:38.030 --> 00:43:40.900
well it came with the body, why?

00:43:40.900 --> 00:43:44.140
And I was going to
say, why are you white?

00:43:44.140 --> 00:43:48.580
But nobody ever asks anybody
that question or about that.

00:43:48.580 --> 00:43:52.010
But you know on reflection,
it's really a great question.

00:43:52.010 --> 00:43:54.670
But it's not a
interview question.

00:43:54.670 --> 00:43:58.270
It's one that you should
ask yourself internally.

00:43:58.270 --> 00:43:59.710
Who am I?

00:43:59.710 --> 00:44:02.470
And your identity is
a lifelong process.

00:44:02.470 --> 00:44:05.980
it's a process, not an
event of who you are.

00:44:05.980 --> 00:44:10.840
But one that you share with your
family and your close friends,

00:44:10.840 --> 00:44:12.100
your relatives.

00:44:12.100 --> 00:44:16.210
In talking about identity
and who belongs and why.

00:44:19.620 --> 00:44:26.100
So you can't run from who you
are or where you came from.

00:44:26.100 --> 00:44:28.920
No matter what you
do or how far you go.

00:44:28.920 --> 00:44:31.500
And so Olivia, you know
you always have a home.

00:44:31.500 --> 00:44:33.000
You may have a
house in California,

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:34.800
but you have a
home in Wisconsin.

00:44:34.800 --> 00:44:37.080
And that you know where that is.

00:44:37.080 --> 00:44:38.880
And some of our people
don't know that.

00:44:44.370 --> 00:44:49.290
My grandmother was
born in 1876, the year

00:44:49.290 --> 00:44:54.360
of when the Sioux and the
Cheyenne defeated Custer.

00:44:54.360 --> 00:44:55.740
And she's a Mohawk.

00:44:55.740 --> 00:44:59.610
But she was an orphan,
and she was adopted

00:44:59.610 --> 00:45:01.260
by a doctor in Philadelphia.

00:45:01.260 --> 00:45:04.890
So she graduated from
medical school in 1899.

00:45:04.890 --> 00:45:06.960
And she said, and
it's another story,

00:45:06.960 --> 00:45:11.010
but she said, going to school
and getting an education are

00:45:11.010 --> 00:45:12.574
two different things.

00:45:12.574 --> 00:45:14.490
And they don't always
happen at the same time.

00:45:17.400 --> 00:45:19.650
So if you're Indian
student here at Harvard,

00:45:19.650 --> 00:45:21.030
you know, you've got two majors.

00:45:21.030 --> 00:45:23.580
Whether it's history
or policy or law.

00:45:23.580 --> 00:45:27.320
But the other major you
have is being a native.

00:45:27.320 --> 00:45:29.650
And that you have to work
on that whatever that means.

00:45:29.650 --> 00:45:32.720
It means you had go home, you
have to engage in community.

00:45:32.720 --> 00:45:37.700
You just can't- one of the
poorest markers for any

00:45:37.700 --> 00:45:40.670
identity markers, of
course, is blood quantum.

00:45:40.670 --> 00:45:42.560
I mean, it just
doesn't make any sense.

00:45:45.230 --> 00:45:49.490
So my grandmother worked, well
she was doing volunteer work.

00:45:49.490 --> 00:45:52.100
I'll just do a quick
family history.

00:45:52.100 --> 00:45:55.220
She was doing volunteer
work at Carlisle.

00:45:55.220 --> 00:45:59.210
Met my grandfather,
they fell in love,

00:45:59.210 --> 00:46:02.040
and they did something stupid
like get married, but they did.

00:46:02.040 --> 00:46:06.290
And so in 1986 she moved
to the Oneida reservation.

00:46:06.290 --> 00:46:10.070
So she had her, she had
six kids in eight years,

00:46:10.070 --> 00:46:12.020
the youngest one was
five-month-old twins.

00:46:12.020 --> 00:46:14.180
And my grandfather
dies of appendicitis

00:46:14.180 --> 00:46:16.160
before she could
get him to surgery.

00:46:16.160 --> 00:46:23.090
So she raised six children in
World War I. The depression,

00:46:23.090 --> 00:46:25.310
the Korean War and World
War II, as a single family

00:46:25.310 --> 00:46:27.240
country Indian doctor.

00:46:27.240 --> 00:46:29.150
And so I grew up
thinking everybody

00:46:29.150 --> 00:46:30.830
had a grandmother
who was a doctor.

00:46:30.830 --> 00:46:32.030
It's not true.

00:46:32.030 --> 00:46:32.630
It's not true.

00:46:32.630 --> 00:46:36.620
But anyway, you
come to this road

00:46:36.620 --> 00:46:38.599
you can't pick your
relatives, some of them

00:46:38.599 --> 00:46:39.890
you'd like to get rid of maybe.

00:46:39.890 --> 00:46:42.260
But you always can't
pick your relatives.

00:46:42.260 --> 00:46:47.330
But she had a kitchen clinic
open 24/7 for nearly 50 years.

00:46:47.330 --> 00:46:52.130
And she gave, I used to
work the college Menominee

00:46:52.130 --> 00:46:55.890
and some girls were
ready to have a baby.

00:46:55.890 --> 00:46:58.700
He says, I got forceps and
I'm not afraid to use them.

00:46:58.700 --> 00:47:00.916
And you would never have
that baby here in college

00:47:00.916 --> 00:47:02.790
because I wouldn't know
what to do with them.

00:47:02.790 --> 00:47:09.680
But nonetheless, she gave
birth to hundreds of Oneidas.

00:47:09.680 --> 00:47:12.880
And maybe, some of your
relatives, I don't know.

00:47:12.880 --> 00:47:15.950
There were a lot of home births
she did a lot of home visits

00:47:15.950 --> 00:47:19.850
when people did that
in 20s and 30s and 40s.

00:47:19.850 --> 00:47:26.060
And so in 1947, on Thanksgiving
Day, the tribe had a ceremony

00:47:26.060 --> 00:47:28.490
and they adopted her.

00:47:28.490 --> 00:47:31.550
They adopted into
the Oneida tribe.

00:47:31.550 --> 00:47:36.020
But they never enrolled her.

00:47:36.020 --> 00:47:38.050
But she was part
of the community.

00:47:38.050 --> 00:47:42.180
And she was grateful that they
were, that she was included.

00:47:42.180 --> 00:47:46.350
But never included legally, or
politically or any other way

00:47:46.350 --> 00:47:48.330
that you measure.

00:47:48.330 --> 00:47:54.080
And so I ended up being Mohawk
Oneida, and my mother was Cree.

00:47:54.080 --> 00:47:59.280
But again, measuring in that
way just doesn't make any sense.

00:47:59.280 --> 00:48:03.640
The Haudenosaunee , the Iroquois
Confederacy had a tradition

00:48:03.640 --> 00:48:05.410
of adoption.

00:48:05.410 --> 00:48:10.540
And to keep our populations
up and our people up, we

00:48:10.540 --> 00:48:12.290
adopted people
from other tribes.

00:48:12.290 --> 00:48:16.030
Hurons or Matenicoks or anybody.

00:48:16.030 --> 00:48:19.670
And they became
part of our nation.

00:48:19.670 --> 00:48:24.310
So well, if we capture
somebody like a Huron,

00:48:24.310 --> 00:48:28.270
we'd bring them in and
they could take my,

00:48:28.270 --> 00:48:31.120
if I was killed in battle,
they would take my place.

00:48:31.120 --> 00:48:34.000
So I became a father and uncle
in that role in that community.

00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:37.710
So you're on one year probation.

00:48:37.710 --> 00:48:40.890
And if you didn't
pass probation,

00:48:40.890 --> 00:48:42.430
the women got to torture you.

00:48:42.430 --> 00:48:45.070
And if they did if you
died within 24 hours,

00:48:45.070 --> 00:48:45.730
it's a bad job.

00:48:45.730 --> 00:48:49.630
So it's quite an incentive
to get with the program.

00:48:49.630 --> 00:48:54.370
And so we kept our
people together.

00:48:54.370 --> 00:48:57.490
So there's adoptions
into tribes.

00:48:57.490 --> 00:49:01.630
Legally, ceremonially, and
some of the adoption papers

00:49:01.630 --> 00:49:05.560
were buried and people can't
figure out where they belong

00:49:05.560 --> 00:49:07.640
or who they belong to.

00:49:07.640 --> 00:49:09.920
So it's problematic.

00:49:12.840 --> 00:49:15.659
So saying you're an
Indian and being an Indian

00:49:15.659 --> 00:49:16.700
are two different things.

00:49:20.140 --> 00:49:22.570
You got so many
Cherokee princesses

00:49:22.570 --> 00:49:26.240
running around here we don't
know how to count them.

00:49:26.240 --> 00:49:35.170
So the book was intended to
educate and engage people.

00:49:35.170 --> 00:49:37.960
Because there was nothing out
there in terms of writing.

00:49:37.960 --> 00:49:44.570
I mean we got authors around
the world in Japan and in Maori,

00:49:44.570 --> 00:49:53.550
and people said that they
knew either the government was

00:49:53.550 --> 00:50:00.800
awfully lucky or they
intended to do away with us.

00:50:00.800 --> 00:50:05.210
And I think this is Senator
Higgins from Delaware in 1895,

00:50:05.210 --> 00:50:06.340
said this.

00:50:06.340 --> 00:50:09.350
It seems to me one of
the ways of getting rid

00:50:09.350 --> 00:50:13.130
of the Indian question
is intermarriage

00:50:13.130 --> 00:50:16.100
and the gradual fading
out of Indian blood.

00:50:16.100 --> 00:50:20.780
The whole quality and character
of the aborigine disappears.

00:50:20.780 --> 00:50:23.090
They lose all of the
traditions of the race.

00:50:23.090 --> 00:50:25.130
There's no longer any
occasion to maintain

00:50:25.130 --> 00:50:26.930
any tribal relations.

00:50:26.930 --> 00:50:29.090
And there is then
every reason why

00:50:29.090 --> 00:50:32.090
they shall go out and take
their place as white people do

00:50:32.090 --> 00:50:33.420
everywhere.

00:50:33.420 --> 00:50:40.230
So that's 1895.

00:50:40.230 --> 00:50:46.440
Well in 1924, when my
father was 12 years old

00:50:46.440 --> 00:50:48.120
he became a citizen.

00:50:48.120 --> 00:50:51.250
Now we were here 10,000
years before that.

00:50:51.250 --> 00:50:53.790
So I guess they figured
you were going to stay.

00:50:53.790 --> 00:51:03.950
And so in 1934, 10 years later,
the Indian Reorganization Act

00:51:03.950 --> 00:51:05.460
was passed.

00:51:05.460 --> 00:51:08.940
And somebody Indians called
this the Indian New Deal,

00:51:08.940 --> 00:51:12.420
and some other Indians call
it the Indian raw deal.

00:51:12.420 --> 00:51:14.010
And it was both.

00:51:14.010 --> 00:51:19.840
But we got a chance to
restore tribal governments.

00:51:19.840 --> 00:51:23.300
But government lawyers
wrote the constitutions

00:51:23.300 --> 00:51:28.340
in which they introduced
the issue of blood quantum.

00:51:28.340 --> 00:51:30.520
We were able to
buy some land back.

00:51:30.520 --> 00:51:32.167
So you got to
remember, 1934, we're

00:51:32.167 --> 00:51:33.500
in the middle of the Depression.

00:51:33.500 --> 00:51:35.410
So we didn't have much.

00:51:35.410 --> 00:51:37.130
And so they were
offering goodies.

00:51:37.130 --> 00:51:39.380
And they said, oh, by the
way, we've got to have rolls

00:51:39.380 --> 00:51:42.342
and you've got to do
measure of blood quantum.

00:51:42.342 --> 00:51:44.300
And also, one of the
other things the footnotes

00:51:44.300 --> 00:51:47.770
was saying Robert's
Rules of Order.

00:51:47.770 --> 00:51:51.710
And sometimes it just turns
to Robert's rules of disorder.

00:51:51.710 --> 00:51:56.150
Because our traditional, way of
making decisions was consensus.

00:51:56.150 --> 00:51:57.470
It wasn't majority.

00:51:57.470 --> 00:52:01.220
You don't need 50% plus
one, because the other 49%

00:52:01.220 --> 00:52:04.610
tries to undermine
that whole operation.

00:52:04.610 --> 00:52:07.210
And so consensus
does take longer,

00:52:07.210 --> 00:52:10.790
but I think we need to find
a traditional way that we

00:52:10.790 --> 00:52:12.530
can get closer to consensus.

00:52:12.530 --> 00:52:14.840
And that way,
decision will stick.

00:52:17.350 --> 00:52:18.034
Now where was I?

00:52:18.034 --> 00:52:19.200
Where was I going with that?

00:52:22.430 --> 00:52:26.480
So the tribal leaders agreed
to it, like in many places

00:52:26.480 --> 00:52:27.110
our guys did.

00:52:27.110 --> 00:52:31.160
But they married then
the girl next door.

00:52:31.160 --> 00:52:32.570
And so they were full bloods.

00:52:32.570 --> 00:52:36.180
And so they said, maybe this
is going to be a problem.

00:52:36.180 --> 00:52:38.670
But it's not going
to be our problem.

00:52:38.670 --> 00:52:42.890
And here we are 2 and
1/2 generations later,

00:52:42.890 --> 00:52:47.540
that we're talking
about, we know

00:52:47.540 --> 00:52:50.900
right now that in Oneida,
46 percent of our people

00:52:50.900 --> 00:52:54.840
are quarter bloods, another
14% are less than half.

00:52:54.840 --> 00:52:56.900
Indians marry out,
including Oneidas, more

00:52:56.900 --> 00:52:59.730
than any other ethnic group.

00:52:59.730 --> 00:53:03.770
And it's not hard to see,
if you look at demographics,

00:53:03.770 --> 00:53:06.937
that we don't come from
families of 10 and 12 anymore.

00:53:06.937 --> 00:53:08.270
We have families of one and two.

00:53:08.270 --> 00:53:12.920
So our mortality rate is higher.

00:53:12.920 --> 00:53:14.150
It's going to be higher.

00:53:14.150 --> 00:53:16.920
So our population is
going to curve like this.

00:53:16.920 --> 00:53:19.832
And the birth rates
are going to be lower.

00:53:19.832 --> 00:53:22.040
And so we're going to come
theoretically at the point

00:53:22.040 --> 00:53:22.910
where we're going to have zero.

00:53:22.910 --> 00:53:24.230
So we're all under, I don't
know if you guys know,

00:53:24.230 --> 00:53:25.410
Ishi in two worlds.

00:53:25.410 --> 00:53:27.970
It's the last Indian of the
founders of California tribe.

00:53:27.970 --> 00:53:30.860
He lived in the
basement of a museum.

00:53:30.860 --> 00:53:32.990
You know it's just
a horrible story.

00:53:32.990 --> 00:53:35.075
But I would hate to
think that we are all

00:53:35.075 --> 00:53:36.950
going to become Ishi's
at some point in time.

00:53:36.950 --> 00:53:40.040
So, we have an opportunity.

00:53:40.040 --> 00:53:43.532
We have an opportunity
to reinvent ourselves.

00:53:43.532 --> 00:53:44.990
One of the things
that is happening

00:53:44.990 --> 00:53:47.570
in Oneida at this point.

00:53:47.570 --> 00:53:50.550
We thought, well God,
we see the trend.

00:53:50.550 --> 00:53:55.320
And we're in a box and
we can't get out of.

00:53:55.320 --> 00:53:57.270
Because anytime
you ask anybody who

00:53:57.270 --> 00:54:00.480
they are, I'm glad
you don't tell them,

00:54:00.480 --> 00:54:03.870
I'm half this or quarter
that or either or whatever.

00:54:03.870 --> 00:54:07.260
Is that we identify ourselves
by our own blood quantum.

00:54:07.260 --> 00:54:09.930
So we've been
institutionalized to think

00:54:09.930 --> 00:54:13.980
of ourselves in fractions.

00:54:13.980 --> 00:54:18.440
And so it's a difficult
box to get out of.

00:54:18.440 --> 00:54:21.140
And we do we can't afford not
to have that conversation.

00:54:21.140 --> 00:54:23.850
No tribe can't
afford not to have.

00:54:23.850 --> 00:54:26.090
And the enemy, the biggest
enemy we have right now,

00:54:26.090 --> 00:54:28.160
is not a government it's time.

00:54:28.160 --> 00:54:30.080
Time is their biggest enemy.

00:54:30.080 --> 00:54:37.450
And so we've got big
decisions to make.

00:54:37.450 --> 00:54:38.950
And we'd like to
get to consensus.

00:54:38.950 --> 00:54:41.450
What's happening at this
point for our folks.

00:54:41.450 --> 00:54:44.560
We did a lot of articles
in the newspaper,

00:54:44.560 --> 00:54:47.890
and we had brown bags
and we had summits

00:54:47.890 --> 00:54:52.510
and we've been doing a lot
to educate people with it.

00:54:52.510 --> 00:54:56.500
The thing is, all that
came out this is the book.

00:54:56.500 --> 00:54:58.820
But it's really a
complicated issue.

00:54:58.820 --> 00:55:01.900
So if we were, we've got
17,000 members right now.

00:55:01.900 --> 00:55:07.740
So if we went to one eighth,
we'd have over 25,000.

00:55:07.740 --> 00:55:10.800
And then 20 years later we
have the same conversation.

00:55:10.800 --> 00:55:12.660
Because we're going
to go to the 16th.

00:55:12.660 --> 00:55:13.580
So it doesn't work.

00:55:13.580 --> 00:55:17.160
And so every time,
exponentially, our population

00:55:17.160 --> 00:55:18.780
increases.

00:55:18.780 --> 00:55:22.640
But we can't afford
the benefits.

00:55:22.640 --> 00:55:26.460
So we have three
elephants in the room.

00:55:26.460 --> 00:55:28.950
One is benefits.

00:55:28.950 --> 00:55:31.250
The other ones are
descendants, usually only

00:55:31.250 --> 00:55:34.290
get one elephant in
the room, we got three.

00:55:34.290 --> 00:55:37.440
And the other ones
are ancestors.

00:55:37.440 --> 00:55:39.570
And somebody else,
like [INAUDIBLE]

00:55:39.570 --> 00:55:42.360
suggested to me that we have
a whole herd of elephants.

00:55:42.360 --> 00:55:45.710
And so we have it.

00:55:45.710 --> 00:55:49.210
It's really kind
of a Rubik's cube.

00:55:49.210 --> 00:55:52.550
If you take it and twist it,
and you know the configurations

00:55:52.550 --> 00:55:55.050
you can you get into, well.

00:55:55.050 --> 00:55:58.280
But every one of these
squares has an issue.

00:55:58.280 --> 00:56:02.740
And once you solve one issue,
you create another one.

00:56:02.740 --> 00:56:04.990
And so it's not a simple answer.

00:56:04.990 --> 00:56:06.790
So people get the book,
and they say well,

00:56:06.790 --> 00:56:08.050
we'll just read
the last chapter.

00:56:08.050 --> 00:56:09.549
There's a silver
bullet there, we're

00:56:09.549 --> 00:56:12.200
going to ride into the
sunset with a solution.

00:56:12.200 --> 00:56:13.881
I said, not so.

00:56:13.881 --> 00:56:14.530
Not so.

00:56:14.530 --> 00:56:16.870
So it comes to
be, are we members

00:56:16.870 --> 00:56:20.830
of a club that provides
benefits to its members,

00:56:20.830 --> 00:56:24.174
or are we citizens of a nation.

00:56:24.174 --> 00:56:25.590
And if we're
citizens of a nation,

00:56:25.590 --> 00:56:28.000
we have a responsibility.

00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:30.280
And what is that responsibility?

00:56:30.280 --> 00:56:33.100
To ourselves and
and to each other.

00:56:33.100 --> 00:56:35.312
So we got to talk
about responsibility.

00:56:35.312 --> 00:56:37.270
And we've got to talk
about, does it mean well,

00:56:37.270 --> 00:56:39.520
if I know if I can count
to 10 in my language,

00:56:39.520 --> 00:56:41.155
or do I have to
know the history?

00:56:43.960 --> 00:56:46.237
Am I connected to the community?

00:56:46.237 --> 00:56:46.945
There's kinships.

00:56:50.110 --> 00:56:52.920
I'm sure in your family
you find 300 members.

00:56:52.920 --> 00:56:57.580
Yeah but I mean, we're all
interconnected in some way.

00:56:57.580 --> 00:57:01.630
So we have to figure out how-
So our grandmothers in a sense,

00:57:01.630 --> 00:57:03.854
are saying, of course
you know grandmothers.

00:57:03.854 --> 00:57:05.270
You know they love
their children.

00:57:05.270 --> 00:57:07.645
They love their grandchildren,
their great grandchildren.

00:57:07.645 --> 00:57:10.120
So they want them to
be part of the nation.

00:57:10.120 --> 00:57:13.910
Because they have the
fruits of being a member,

00:57:13.910 --> 00:57:16.480
and they've got per capita,
and they get health,

00:57:16.480 --> 00:57:20.476
and they get other
kind of goodies

00:57:20.476 --> 00:57:21.850
I guess you would
call them, that

00:57:21.850 --> 00:57:24.520
are benefits of the nation.

00:57:24.520 --> 00:57:26.400
And they want them enrolled.

00:57:26.400 --> 00:57:29.460
But that's in their heart.

00:57:29.460 --> 00:57:32.220
In their head, they
know blood quantum

00:57:32.220 --> 00:57:34.570
doesn't work all the time.

00:57:34.570 --> 00:57:36.550
And so we're sort of
stuck in a paralysis

00:57:36.550 --> 00:57:40.730
right now, of trying
to make a decision.

00:57:40.730 --> 00:57:43.170
And I'm trying to
figure out how do you

00:57:43.170 --> 00:57:45.950
put those two folks
together next to each other,

00:57:45.950 --> 00:57:47.630
not opposing each other.

00:57:47.630 --> 00:57:50.090
But to have a conversation
saying how can we have it?

00:57:50.090 --> 00:57:53.600
Can we have it both ways?

00:57:53.600 --> 00:57:55.240
And maybe not.

00:57:55.240 --> 00:57:57.980
If you talk to Warren Lions
he'd go right straight back

00:57:57.980 --> 00:57:59.570
to the traditional way.

00:57:59.570 --> 00:58:01.430
Matrilineal, and if
you're not born here,

00:58:01.430 --> 00:58:05.546
you're not part of your mother's
line, you're not a member.

00:58:05.546 --> 00:58:06.920
The Pottawatomie's
really came up

00:58:06.920 --> 00:58:08.980
with a unique kind
of solution for them.

00:58:08.980 --> 00:58:12.590
And as a sovereign nation, they
have every right to do that.

00:58:12.590 --> 00:58:13.790
So they get to decide.

00:58:13.790 --> 00:58:15.600
And so every tribe
gets to decide.

00:58:15.600 --> 00:58:19.830
And so that's really going to
be the act of self-government.

00:58:19.830 --> 00:58:21.890
Of who we are, and
where we come from.

00:58:21.890 --> 00:58:25.890
So we have to live in the past,
the present, and the future

00:58:25.890 --> 00:58:27.820
at the same time.

00:58:27.820 --> 00:58:32.946
We need to look forward and
look back at the same time.

00:58:32.946 --> 00:58:34.320
Move forward look
back and that's

00:58:34.320 --> 00:58:37.470
where we get a perspective.

00:58:37.470 --> 00:58:40.680
Abraham Lincoln said, a house
divided against itself cannot

00:58:40.680 --> 00:58:42.410
stand.

00:58:42.410 --> 00:58:44.730
So not doing anything is
going to be a problem.

00:58:44.730 --> 00:58:51.590
Faulkner said, the past is
never dead, it's not even past.

00:58:51.590 --> 00:58:58.050
So I think we need to
think about these issues.

00:58:58.050 --> 00:59:01.220
Now, I wrote a
speech before I came,

00:59:01.220 --> 00:59:04.850
I made all kinds of notes,
and I have three speeches.

00:59:04.850 --> 00:59:06.564
And I haven't done any of them.

00:59:06.564 --> 00:59:08.480
So let me let me see if
I can catch up and see

00:59:08.480 --> 00:59:12.320
if there's anything else they
need to- is my 15 minutes up?

00:59:12.320 --> 00:59:15.012
It is, huh?

00:59:15.012 --> 00:59:15.970
About two minutes left?

00:59:15.970 --> 00:59:16.430
Good.

00:59:16.430 --> 00:59:18.221
I was afraid I didn't
have enough material.

00:59:24.590 --> 00:59:27.590
Well we have to
find our is finding

00:59:27.590 --> 00:59:30.620
our collective better self.

00:59:30.620 --> 00:59:34.130
And indigenous people around
the world are at risk.

00:59:34.130 --> 00:59:35.130
I mean it's just not us.

00:59:35.130 --> 00:59:37.700
There's 52 tribes,
I think, in Peru.

00:59:37.700 --> 00:59:40.850
And they're you can go back 200
years to what happened here, is

00:59:40.850 --> 00:59:41.600
happening to them.

00:59:41.600 --> 00:59:47.060
For resources,
there is genocide.

00:59:47.060 --> 00:59:50.750
And so the problem
is what matters here?

00:59:53.300 --> 00:59:54.920
And sovereignty matters.

00:59:54.920 --> 00:59:58.950
If we're tribal nations,
sovereignty matters.

00:59:58.950 --> 01:00:00.180
Institutions matter.

01:00:00.180 --> 01:00:02.130
You know, we have
elected leaders,

01:00:02.130 --> 01:00:04.140
we have tribal councils,
we have schools,

01:00:04.140 --> 01:00:06.330
we have health centers,
we have rec centers,

01:00:06.330 --> 01:00:07.860
we have our institutions.

01:00:07.860 --> 01:00:09.040
And they matter.

01:00:09.040 --> 01:00:11.080
They matter a lot.

01:00:11.080 --> 01:00:12.390
Culture matters.

01:00:12.390 --> 01:00:15.430
So are our language,
our creation stories,

01:00:15.430 --> 01:00:19.030
our language are all the
things that entail of who

01:00:19.030 --> 01:00:21.970
we are as a cultural people.

01:00:21.970 --> 01:00:22.670
Count.

01:00:22.670 --> 01:00:24.180
They matter.

01:00:24.180 --> 01:00:26.520
And leadership matters.

01:00:26.520 --> 01:00:29.880
And so everyone counts.

01:00:29.880 --> 01:00:31.980
And everybody is a leader.

01:00:31.980 --> 01:00:34.700
It's just not something
some people back home say,

01:00:34.700 --> 01:00:37.740
well Hill's got a
solution up his sleeve,

01:00:37.740 --> 01:00:39.600
he just ain't told us yet.

01:00:39.600 --> 01:00:42.430
Well, I wish I did.

01:00:42.430 --> 01:00:47.340
And so I think I'm just going to
stop here and collect my stuff

01:00:47.340 --> 01:00:48.750
and sit down.

01:00:48.750 --> 01:00:52.800
But I appreciate your attention
and thank you for showing up.

01:00:52.800 --> 01:00:55.290
I really, you know,
there is a buzz

01:00:55.290 --> 01:00:58.440
in Indian country
about blood quantum.

01:00:58.440 --> 01:01:05.840
You know and so it may be
the best, the most important

01:01:05.840 --> 01:01:12.800
decisions that Indians
will make this century.

01:01:12.800 --> 01:01:15.010
Because really, our
survival depends on it.

01:01:15.010 --> 01:01:15.660
So, thank you.

01:01:24.390 --> 01:01:26.850
- Thank you to all
three of our panelists.

01:01:26.850 --> 01:01:28.637
And I think Norbert
you're, that question,

01:01:28.637 --> 01:01:29.970
I think you're absolutely right.

01:01:29.970 --> 01:01:33.410
I think that is a tremendously
important question

01:01:33.410 --> 01:01:35.090
for our time.

01:01:35.090 --> 01:01:37.040
I'm going to highlight
just a few things

01:01:37.040 --> 01:01:41.670
and then ask one question
of the 15 that I have here.

01:01:41.670 --> 01:01:45.840
So we can maximize our time
for you to ask questions.

01:01:45.840 --> 01:01:50.660
But a couple of points that were
made by the various presenters

01:01:50.660 --> 01:01:52.790
that I wanted to highlight.

01:01:52.790 --> 01:01:55.760
And others that were
just sort of obliquely

01:01:55.760 --> 01:01:58.760
referred to that I want
to actually highlight

01:01:58.760 --> 01:02:00.270
in particular.

01:02:00.270 --> 01:02:05.772
And that is the premium
attached to belonging.

01:02:05.772 --> 01:02:07.730
I'm not going to use the
loaded words, or is it

01:02:07.730 --> 01:02:09.650
a member or you are a citizen.

01:02:09.650 --> 01:02:12.990
But the concept of belonging.

01:02:12.990 --> 01:02:15.740
There is a premium
attached to the answer

01:02:15.740 --> 01:02:19.670
to that question in the
last several decades.

01:02:19.670 --> 01:02:21.680
That is bears on
this conversation,

01:02:21.680 --> 01:02:23.540
because it's not just
native people that

01:02:23.540 --> 01:02:26.250
are interested in the
answer to that question.

01:02:26.250 --> 01:02:30.350
There's a whole lot of eyes
looking from the outside

01:02:30.350 --> 01:02:31.370
and the inside.

01:02:31.370 --> 01:02:34.160
Courts are looking,
politicians are looking,

01:02:34.160 --> 01:02:35.960
your neighbors are looking.

01:02:35.960 --> 01:02:38.870
Everyone wants to see how does
that question get answered,

01:02:38.870 --> 01:02:41.810
because there's a lot
riding on that question.

01:02:41.810 --> 01:02:44.689
Whether or not a community
gets to do certain things.

01:02:44.689 --> 01:02:46.980
Whether or not a child gets
covered by the Indian Child

01:02:46.980 --> 01:02:48.850
Welfare Act.

01:02:48.850 --> 01:02:51.380
Whether benefits and
other kinds of things

01:02:51.380 --> 01:02:54.080
that are going to flow
to certain members

01:02:54.080 --> 01:02:57.020
or to an entire community.

01:02:57.020 --> 01:02:58.580
And then there's
abstract concepts

01:02:58.580 --> 01:02:59.800
that are in play there.

01:02:59.800 --> 01:03:03.890
The folks will talk about what
are the systems, the processes

01:03:03.890 --> 01:03:07.940
happening within the
communities that are evolving

01:03:07.940 --> 01:03:10.220
to help redress that question?

01:03:10.220 --> 01:03:13.370
And if things don't
strike outsiders

01:03:13.370 --> 01:03:16.460
as fair, as if it's their
business, but in a way

01:03:16.460 --> 01:03:17.510
it is their business.

01:03:17.510 --> 01:03:21.950
Because all of this is happening
within the context, of course,

01:03:21.950 --> 01:03:23.810
of the nation state.

01:03:23.810 --> 01:03:27.290
And so this whole phenomena
that all three of our panelists

01:03:27.290 --> 01:03:30.440
spoke about, the
tribes sovereignty

01:03:30.440 --> 01:03:34.430
operating within the larger
matrix of a nation state.

01:03:34.430 --> 01:03:38.970
These questions are not being
asked and answered in a vacuum.

01:03:38.970 --> 01:03:42.740
They're not being asked and
answered in the abstract.

01:03:42.740 --> 01:03:45.470
There are a lot of eyes
that are paying attention.

01:03:45.470 --> 01:03:47.510
The courts are intensely
interested of this,

01:03:47.510 --> 01:03:50.960
because they regularly
get appeals from folks

01:03:50.960 --> 01:03:53.100
who have been disenrolled.

01:03:53.100 --> 01:03:57.370
Who have been declared not
members, or not citizens.

01:03:57.370 --> 01:04:00.060
And so they're looking anywhere
they can for an audience.

01:04:00.060 --> 01:04:02.310
To say whether it's
Congress, like the freedmen

01:04:02.310 --> 01:04:06.090
of the Cherokee Nation found
an audience with Congress

01:04:06.090 --> 01:04:10.110
that held lots of appropriations
over the heads of the Cherokee

01:04:10.110 --> 01:04:13.410
Nation until there
was a change there.

01:04:13.410 --> 01:04:15.660
And the courts, if you
haven't read their opinions,

01:04:15.660 --> 01:04:17.730
are very sympathetic.

01:04:17.730 --> 01:04:20.010
Not because I think
they like Indians,

01:04:20.010 --> 01:04:22.590
because I think that they
understand that there's

01:04:22.590 --> 01:04:25.530
a premium on the
part of the nation

01:04:25.530 --> 01:04:28.180
to keep those numbers down.

01:04:28.180 --> 01:04:30.120
In other words, everything
that our panelists

01:04:30.120 --> 01:04:33.570
talked about here,
represents a trajectory

01:04:33.570 --> 01:04:39.420
about the inevitable decline and
elimination of native peoples.

01:04:39.420 --> 01:04:42.750
And sustaining sovereignty
and sustaining memberships,

01:04:42.750 --> 01:04:46.890
sustaining citizenship is
sort of a reversal of that.

01:04:46.890 --> 01:04:52.300
It's a contestation
of that trajectory.

01:04:52.300 --> 01:04:56.170
And so there are forces
that push back on that.

01:04:56.170 --> 01:04:58.800
So I just wanted
to make that note

01:04:58.800 --> 01:05:03.360
in terms of the context in
which these decisions, as

01:05:03.360 --> 01:05:07.110
difficult as they are, are
even rendered more difficult

01:05:07.110 --> 01:05:10.770
because of the political
and legal, and even moral

01:05:10.770 --> 01:05:14.140
context in which those
questions are being asked.

01:05:14.140 --> 01:05:15.180
So a question.

01:05:15.180 --> 01:05:17.470
One question to each of you.

01:05:17.470 --> 01:05:21.780
We've used words, the
vocabulary that goes along

01:05:21.780 --> 01:05:26.190
with these very
fraught issues float

01:05:26.190 --> 01:05:27.660
amongst a number of terms.

01:05:27.660 --> 01:05:33.360
Citizens, members,
even indigenous.

01:05:33.360 --> 01:05:35.850
What does that mean?

01:05:35.850 --> 01:05:39.540
And it's very difficult to
wrap your heads around that.

01:05:39.540 --> 01:05:43.050
And some of you
may know, the folks

01:05:43.050 --> 01:05:45.780
who gave us the UN Declaration
on the Rights of Indigenous

01:05:45.780 --> 01:05:48.280
Peoples, ultimately
elected not to have

01:05:48.280 --> 01:05:52.650
the definition of indigenous
in that formative document.

01:05:52.650 --> 01:05:56.880
Because of these
challenges that we face.

01:05:56.880 --> 01:06:00.960
So let me ask the panelists
what do those terms mean to you?

01:06:00.960 --> 01:06:06.430
In the broader context
and matrix of belonging,

01:06:06.430 --> 01:06:09.400
what do those terms mean
to you, if anything?

01:06:13.120 --> 01:06:17.330
- Well you know, first of
all, we're governments.

01:06:17.330 --> 01:06:18.870
Were nations.

01:06:18.870 --> 01:06:20.790
And so we get to decide.

01:06:20.790 --> 01:06:26.580
And one of the problems that we
just got the BIA off our backs.

01:06:26.580 --> 01:06:28.590
So we get to make
decisions and we

01:06:28.590 --> 01:06:31.170
don't have to wait for
their approval any longer.

01:06:31.170 --> 01:06:34.230
But that took a long time to
make our constitutional change,

01:06:34.230 --> 01:06:36.630
because we became
wards of the government

01:06:36.630 --> 01:06:39.380
thanks to the irate government.

01:06:39.380 --> 01:06:42.570
So if we're a sovereign
nations, we should be sovereign.

01:06:42.570 --> 01:06:47.430
We should be able to have
our own self-government.

01:06:47.430 --> 01:06:51.080
If we say we're a tribe,
then we have members.

01:06:51.080 --> 01:06:53.530
But you know the language
that I like to use,

01:06:53.530 --> 01:06:57.790
is that I'm a citizen
of the United Nations.

01:06:57.790 --> 01:07:02.970
So instead of using the word
tribe, and we're so used to it,

01:07:02.970 --> 01:07:05.440
we get really sloppy
in our language.

01:07:05.440 --> 01:07:08.940
We have to see ourselves as
a nation national citizens

01:07:08.940 --> 01:07:10.954
of the particular group
that we belong to.

01:07:10.954 --> 01:07:12.120
And we have to respect that.

01:07:16.120 --> 01:07:18.580
- I would agree.

01:07:18.580 --> 01:07:20.290
Because we have so
many tribal members,

01:07:20.290 --> 01:07:24.220
and because the ascendancy
is a sort of loaded term

01:07:24.220 --> 01:07:26.910
amongst different Native
American tribes, whether or not

01:07:26.910 --> 01:07:29.650
that is something
that they agree with.

01:07:29.650 --> 01:07:32.430
You know, sometimes
people's view

01:07:32.430 --> 01:07:34.960
this vision of sense
of Pottawatomie nation

01:07:34.960 --> 01:07:43.760
to adopt US citizenship in
1861 an act of assimilation.

01:07:43.760 --> 01:07:46.870
But I like the term
citizen, because in 1861

01:07:46.870 --> 01:07:51.652
what my nation did was decide
how they wanted to be seen.

01:07:51.652 --> 01:07:53.110
They decided that
they wanted to be

01:07:53.110 --> 01:07:56.390
citizens, that was their way,
it was an act of sovereignty.

01:07:56.390 --> 01:07:59.950
They had tried hiding,
they had tried, you know,

01:07:59.950 --> 01:08:01.550
resisting removal.

01:08:01.550 --> 01:08:03.490
They had tried being
removed and you

01:08:03.490 --> 01:08:05.680
know living on the new
land, none of that worked.

01:08:05.680 --> 01:08:07.210
So they made the
decision to become

01:08:07.210 --> 01:08:10.710
citizens of the United States.

01:08:10.710 --> 01:08:13.166
But at the same time
they remained as citizens

01:08:13.166 --> 01:08:14.290
of the Pottawatomie nation.

01:08:14.290 --> 01:08:19.870
So for me, that perfectly
encapsulates what a tribe

01:08:19.870 --> 01:08:23.560
is as a citizen of a nation.

01:08:23.560 --> 01:08:27.939
- Yeah I would say, looking
at members versus citizen,

01:08:27.939 --> 01:08:31.720
like the active kind of asking
something of our members,

01:08:31.720 --> 01:08:33.250
of our citizens.

01:08:33.250 --> 01:08:35.140
That one, we're
running out of time.

01:08:35.140 --> 01:08:36.479
We don't have the resources.

01:08:36.479 --> 01:08:38.240
Our languages are dying.

01:08:38.240 --> 01:08:41.290
We have finite
resources and efforts

01:08:41.290 --> 01:08:43.120
that we don't really
have the luxury

01:08:43.120 --> 01:08:45.189
to not learn the language.

01:08:45.189 --> 01:08:46.550
To not carry on the culture.

01:08:46.550 --> 01:08:49.420
If we don't pass on the
torch in our generation,

01:08:49.420 --> 01:08:51.939
there won't be a torch to
have for the next generation.

01:08:51.939 --> 01:08:55.170
I think that comes across in
I think everyone's embracal

01:08:55.170 --> 01:08:56.990
of the word citizen.

01:08:56.990 --> 01:08:58.390
But I think parts of that.

01:08:58.390 --> 01:09:00.160
There's also a
sacrifice to that.

01:09:00.160 --> 01:09:03.520
I think we use Member
almost because tribes

01:09:03.520 --> 01:09:04.270
are like a family.

01:09:04.270 --> 01:09:05.800
So it's a family member.

01:09:05.800 --> 01:09:07.810
We don't necessarily
require anything

01:09:07.810 --> 01:09:09.160
of your aunt or your uncle.

01:09:09.160 --> 01:09:11.999
We don't say you have decided to
contract and learn the language

01:09:11.999 --> 01:09:13.540
and come to all my
birthday recitals.

01:09:13.540 --> 01:09:15.569
Or you know, all of
my different events.

01:09:15.569 --> 01:09:18.050
I would love it if you did,
and I kind of expect you to,

01:09:18.050 --> 01:09:21.010
but we don't make
that a hard requiral.

01:09:21.010 --> 01:09:22.810
But I think that was
a luxury of the past.

01:09:22.810 --> 01:09:24.250
I think we're
moving into a place

01:09:24.250 --> 01:09:27.520
where we can't just hope that
everyone will be, you know,

01:09:27.520 --> 01:09:28.569
great upstanding members.

01:09:28.569 --> 01:09:32.470
We need to institutionalize
citizenship and ask

01:09:32.470 --> 01:09:34.899
for something, as
well, if we are

01:09:34.899 --> 01:09:37.960
going to survive into
the next generation

01:09:37.960 --> 01:09:40.060
and pass that torch
on to the next seven

01:09:40.060 --> 01:09:42.054
generations of native youth.

01:09:42.054 --> 01:09:43.720
And I think when it
comes to indigenous,

01:09:43.720 --> 01:09:45.880
I didn't know that
they didn't choose

01:09:45.880 --> 01:09:47.560
to make it official definition.

01:09:47.560 --> 01:09:51.189
I feel like indigenous is a
word like love or something

01:09:51.189 --> 01:09:52.130
that's very abstract.

01:09:52.130 --> 01:09:54.880
But it shows more
about what we have,

01:09:54.880 --> 01:09:59.710
and what we think about that,
than the unique ramifications

01:09:59.710 --> 01:10:01.030
of what we try to define it.

01:10:01.030 --> 01:10:03.220
I think you can't define love.

01:10:03.220 --> 01:10:05.200
You can't define
a word like that.

01:10:05.200 --> 01:10:07.630
I think it's helpful in
the indigenous community

01:10:07.630 --> 01:10:09.530
to have multiple
different definitions.

01:10:09.530 --> 01:10:12.510
So that we can talk about
the different statuses

01:10:12.510 --> 01:10:13.630
of citizenship.

01:10:13.630 --> 01:10:16.160
So there's elements of
citizenship that's very legal.

01:10:16.160 --> 01:10:18.460
There's elements that are
very emotional and spiritual

01:10:18.460 --> 01:10:21.430
and personal of what it
feels like to be native.

01:10:21.430 --> 01:10:23.560
And then I think
this indigenous term

01:10:23.560 --> 01:10:27.070
is a really safe word and a
safe place for indigenous people

01:10:27.070 --> 01:10:31.420
from all, globally,
to live in and to use

01:10:31.420 --> 01:10:34.264
as a benchmark for us
all to kind of grapple

01:10:34.264 --> 01:10:35.680
with our understandings
of what it

01:10:35.680 --> 01:10:37.660
means to be indigenous to us.

01:10:37.660 --> 01:10:40.540
- So I just wanted
to add that, if we

01:10:40.540 --> 01:10:44.050
have some foreign
nationals bid at us,

01:10:44.050 --> 01:10:46.240
we don't say we have
some Russian members

01:10:46.240 --> 01:10:47.890
or Canadian members.

01:10:47.890 --> 01:10:51.620
We say they're citizens
of their nation.

01:10:51.620 --> 01:10:54.230
And so that's what it is.

01:10:54.230 --> 01:10:56.440
So I like to use
the word citizen

01:10:56.440 --> 01:10:59.210
both as a noun and a verb.

01:10:59.210 --> 01:11:02.960
You know, to be active.

01:11:02.960 --> 01:11:07.390
- OK I think we have about 15
minutes for your questions,

01:11:07.390 --> 01:11:10.900
and the microphone is here.

01:11:15.711 --> 01:11:17.460
So if you could please
introduce yourself,

01:11:17.460 --> 01:11:18.880
tell us a little bit where
you're from, and then

01:11:18.880 --> 01:11:21.046
direct, if you want to
direct it to the whole panel,

01:11:21.046 --> 01:11:22.840
or to one person in particular.

01:11:22.840 --> 01:11:24.540
- Sure thank you for being here.

01:11:24.540 --> 01:11:26.250
This has been awesome.

01:11:26.250 --> 01:11:28.290
My name is Merritt
Bear and my family

01:11:28.290 --> 01:11:32.250
is Ogallala Lakota
from Pine Ridge.

01:11:32.250 --> 01:11:35.040
I want to ask the elephant
in the room question, which

01:11:35.040 --> 01:11:37.130
is playing Indian.

01:11:37.130 --> 01:11:40.440
The Cherokee grandmothers, we
can set aside Elizabeth Warren

01:11:40.440 --> 01:11:41.760
for the time being.

01:11:41.760 --> 01:11:45.240
But just the general
kind of ancestry.com.

01:11:45.240 --> 01:11:49.140
My DNA results say
that I am 4% Indian.

01:11:49.140 --> 01:11:53.220
And the kind of desire to
partake in the sexiness

01:11:53.220 --> 01:11:56.550
and wear Pocahontas
costumes, while not actually

01:11:56.550 --> 01:12:01.440
grappling with or not
being claimed by any tribe.

01:12:01.440 --> 01:12:02.820
- Thank you.

01:12:02.820 --> 01:12:05.610
I recently went to the National
Museum of the American Indian

01:12:05.610 --> 01:12:06.490
in Washington DC.

01:12:06.490 --> 01:12:10.230
They have a new exhibit
that's amazingly modern.

01:12:10.230 --> 01:12:12.336
And it's called
Americans, I believe.

01:12:12.336 --> 01:12:13.710
But one of the
questions it asked

01:12:13.710 --> 01:12:17.700
was, why are Native Americans
everywhere and yet nowhere?

01:12:17.700 --> 01:12:20.640
Why, you know, is there a
Native American on the Land O'

01:12:20.640 --> 01:12:22.236
lakes butter?

01:12:22.236 --> 01:12:23.610
Why are these
symbols everywhere?

01:12:23.610 --> 01:12:25.320
Why are these
stories everywhere?

01:12:25.320 --> 01:12:26.880
And yet why are issues not?

01:12:26.880 --> 01:12:29.460
Why are we as real people
not, in our discussions

01:12:29.460 --> 01:12:31.770
of our current struggles.

01:12:31.770 --> 01:12:33.270
Why are those not
in the forefront?

01:12:33.270 --> 01:12:36.780
And I think whenever I ground
myself in questions like this,

01:12:36.780 --> 01:12:38.620
I like to go more general.

01:12:38.620 --> 01:12:41.280
Why is this, what was the
structure that was in place

01:12:41.280 --> 01:12:44.370
that made the instances that
we see in our everyday lives.

01:12:44.370 --> 01:12:46.405
How did those happen?

01:12:46.405 --> 01:12:48.030
So that's kind of
where I ground myself

01:12:48.030 --> 01:12:51.950
when it comes to those
like individual moments.

01:12:51.950 --> 01:12:53.910
- You know, some people
come to us and say,

01:12:53.910 --> 01:12:57.390
they want to take DNA to figure
out what tribe they belong to.

01:12:57.390 --> 01:13:00.120
Well that's not possible.

01:13:00.120 --> 01:13:03.510
You can tell who your parents
are and that sort of thing,

01:13:03.510 --> 01:13:05.160
but you can't tell what tribe.

01:13:05.160 --> 01:13:07.980
There's just no test to do that.

01:13:07.980 --> 01:13:11.400
I had a, we were
doing scholarships

01:13:11.400 --> 01:13:14.920
and we had a Cherokee
mother call me and she said,

01:13:14.920 --> 01:13:16.330
did I tell you about that?

01:13:16.330 --> 01:13:19.450
Did I say that?

01:13:19.450 --> 01:13:20.529
And she was arguing.

01:13:20.529 --> 01:13:22.070
You know, mothers
just made me crazy,

01:13:22.070 --> 01:13:25.120
because the get real, really
have the student talk to you,

01:13:25.120 --> 01:13:26.860
but the mom called.

01:13:26.860 --> 01:13:28.460
She says, I want
you to know, my son

01:13:28.460 --> 01:13:31.970
is 13th 256 degree Cherokee.

01:13:31.970 --> 01:13:35.460
And she's just chewing me out.

01:13:35.460 --> 01:13:39.080
And I said, ma'am, if
he cuts himself shaving,

01:13:39.080 --> 01:13:40.340
how much blood is left?

01:13:40.340 --> 01:13:42.866
And I held the
phone way out here.

01:13:42.866 --> 01:13:44.240
And she was still,
you could hear

01:13:44.240 --> 01:13:46.800
her screaming in the next room.

01:13:46.800 --> 01:13:49.550
But yet, at the same
time, the young man

01:13:49.550 --> 01:13:52.580
was a citizen of
the Cherokee Nation.

01:13:52.580 --> 01:13:56.660
So it wasn't my role to decide
whether he was eligible enough,

01:13:56.660 --> 01:14:01.366
but we have people in
a variety of places.

01:14:01.366 --> 01:14:02.990
I think we have some
Oneida's someplace

01:14:02.990 --> 01:14:06.320
that can't find
Wisconsin on the map.

01:14:06.320 --> 01:14:08.720
But they want to enjoy
the benefits of it.

01:14:08.720 --> 01:14:11.810
So we've got to figure
how we connect community

01:14:11.810 --> 01:14:15.240
as a verb to those folks.

01:14:15.240 --> 01:14:16.740
- I think going
back to citizenship,

01:14:16.740 --> 01:14:18.492
too, like if you
want to be Oneida,

01:14:18.492 --> 01:14:20.450
and you want to come to
Oneida, live in Oneida,

01:14:20.450 --> 01:14:22.580
learn the language.

01:14:22.580 --> 01:14:25.510
Take on the practices,
do all of the work, yeah,

01:14:25.510 --> 01:14:28.960
call yourself Oneida if you're
going to do all those things.

01:14:28.960 --> 01:14:30.620
- So this has been
a challenge for us.

01:14:30.620 --> 01:14:32.450
When we open up
the rolls, you have

01:14:32.450 --> 01:14:34.190
a lot of members
who may or may not

01:14:34.190 --> 01:14:36.350
have a connection with
the tribe in any way.

01:14:36.350 --> 01:14:40.070
Or, may not have a
way to be connected.

01:14:40.070 --> 01:14:42.260
I always try to kind
of remind myself

01:14:42.260 --> 01:14:45.680
that the reason that
a lot of Pottawatomie

01:14:45.680 --> 01:14:48.560
or other tribal
citizens are removed

01:14:48.560 --> 01:14:51.470
from their culture
or their heritage

01:14:51.470 --> 01:14:53.840
is not the fault of the
person living today.

01:14:53.840 --> 01:14:57.680
It's a fault of policies,
of boarding schools,

01:14:57.680 --> 01:15:00.620
of removals, things like that.

01:15:00.620 --> 01:15:02.920
Adoption, absolutely.

01:15:02.920 --> 01:15:05.570
Now today, they can do things
to connect with their tribe.

01:15:05.570 --> 01:15:10.850
But they weren't born, you
know, guilty of that sin.

01:15:10.850 --> 01:15:13.220
So we do have a lot
of tribal members.

01:15:13.220 --> 01:15:15.380
And one thing that
we've done, in our 2007

01:15:15.380 --> 01:15:17.970
constitutional reform, you
might be sensing a pattern here,

01:15:17.970 --> 01:15:21.020
our tribe likes to
reform its constitution.

01:15:21.020 --> 01:15:24.170
In 2007, we reformed
our constitution

01:15:24.170 --> 01:15:26.420
to have tribal
legislative districts.

01:15:26.420 --> 01:15:29.260
So each district has
a representative,

01:15:29.260 --> 01:15:32.632
a legislator who represents
the constituents of that area.

01:15:32.632 --> 01:15:34.590
So it doesn't matter if
you live in California,

01:15:34.590 --> 01:15:37.730
you have a representative
on the Pottawatomie nation

01:15:37.730 --> 01:15:39.890
who represents you.

01:15:39.890 --> 01:15:43.010
Who speaks on behalf
of their constituents

01:15:43.010 --> 01:15:45.890
at the quarterly
meetings, and holds

01:15:45.890 --> 01:15:50.792
cultural events and educational
events in that area.

01:15:50.792 --> 01:15:52.250
They get some money
from our tribe,

01:15:52.250 --> 01:15:54.230
from our tribal
headquarters, to do that.

01:15:54.230 --> 01:15:56.180
So that's one way we've
tried to address that.

01:15:56.180 --> 01:15:59.570
That doesn't mean that there
aren't Pottawatomie who are

01:15:59.570 --> 01:16:01.970
kind of in it for the benefits.

01:16:01.970 --> 01:16:04.220
But we've tried to
put into place ways

01:16:04.220 --> 01:16:09.500
for them to become connected
as tribal citizens.

01:16:09.500 --> 01:16:11.016
- Thank you.

01:16:11.016 --> 01:16:11.840
- Hi.

01:16:11.840 --> 01:16:12.500
Jay Gleason.

01:16:12.500 --> 01:16:14.270
I'm not a Native American.

01:16:14.270 --> 01:16:16.880
But since the
subject has come up,

01:16:16.880 --> 01:16:18.960
Elizabeth Warren is up
for re-election this year.

01:16:18.960 --> 01:16:20.990
So this question is
going to keep coming up.

01:16:20.990 --> 01:16:23.300
As you said, saying
you're an Indian

01:16:23.300 --> 01:16:26.050
is not the same thing
as being an Indian.

01:16:26.050 --> 01:16:28.160
So we know what's been
said, but we're still not

01:16:28.160 --> 01:16:32.720
clear on how you can be that, or
how you feel about someone that

01:16:32.720 --> 01:16:34.280
says that they can be that.

01:16:34.280 --> 01:16:37.930
Because you've been struggling
with this definition yourself.

01:16:37.930 --> 01:16:40.070
And if you can't pin
it down, then it's

01:16:40.070 --> 01:16:43.730
going to continue to entertain
these doubts about people

01:16:43.730 --> 01:16:45.320
that say these things.

01:16:45.320 --> 01:16:48.690
And you haven't also
said how you "be",

01:16:48.690 --> 01:16:51.010
quote, unquote, an Indian.

01:16:51.010 --> 01:16:53.406
That also seems to be
a little bit amorphous.

01:16:53.406 --> 01:16:55.280
And finally, I would
say that you're not only

01:16:55.280 --> 01:16:57.050
struggling with
questions in citizenship,

01:16:57.050 --> 01:16:58.490
but the larger society is.

01:16:58.490 --> 01:17:01.310
We have a lot of what is
called illegal aliens from one

01:17:01.310 --> 01:17:03.519
perspective, or undocumented
immigrants from another.

01:17:03.519 --> 01:17:06.143
And I don't know whether you're
going to have the same problems

01:17:06.143 --> 01:17:06.680
or not.

01:17:06.680 --> 01:17:09.450
But citizenship nestled
within citizenship

01:17:09.450 --> 01:17:13.140
is also an open question
for the whole society,

01:17:13.140 --> 01:17:15.612
and maybe it is for you
or more narrow focus too.

01:17:15.612 --> 01:17:17.570
I don't know, but I would
be interested in both

01:17:17.570 --> 01:17:19.370
of those kinds of subjects.

01:17:19.370 --> 01:17:24.061
- Well in 1492, if we had
better immigration laws,

01:17:24.061 --> 01:17:25.310
we wouldn't have this problem.

01:17:25.310 --> 01:17:30.320
So everybody, they got here,
they forget how they got here.

01:17:33.850 --> 01:17:35.570
Working in college
universities, and I'm

01:17:35.570 --> 01:17:38.510
sure this happens to Shelly
and others that, well,

01:17:38.510 --> 01:17:42.520
how many natives are enrolled?

01:17:42.520 --> 01:17:45.190
And it's self-identification.

01:17:45.190 --> 01:17:47.180
They say they're
Indians, and they

01:17:47.180 --> 01:17:50.529
might have a wonderful Cherokee
princess story in their family.

01:17:50.529 --> 01:17:51.320
Or some other kind.

01:17:51.320 --> 01:17:53.930
And maybe there
is some heritage.

01:17:53.930 --> 01:17:58.064
But unless they can identify the
specific tribe they belong to.

01:17:58.064 --> 01:17:59.480
Now of course, the
admissions form

01:17:59.480 --> 01:18:01.970
can't put down 500
different tribes.

01:18:01.970 --> 01:18:05.160
I don't you, know, I've
been doing this all my life

01:18:05.160 --> 01:18:08.180
and I don't know
all the tribes, but.

01:18:08.180 --> 01:18:09.940
Excuse me, all the nations.

01:18:09.940 --> 01:18:12.560
And to determine.

01:18:12.560 --> 01:18:16.100
But there's got to be a way
to connect to the community.

01:18:16.100 --> 01:18:18.590
How do you connect
to the communities?

01:18:18.590 --> 01:18:22.460
I mean we, some of you may
remember Warren Churchill.

01:18:22.460 --> 01:18:26.480
And if he can't name or
relative dead or alive,

01:18:26.480 --> 01:18:28.920
his citizenship is
certainly suspect.

01:18:32.270 --> 01:18:35.930
So you got Heather Locklear
running around out there.

01:18:35.930 --> 01:18:40.470
She's a Lumbee, you know, but
she looks like Snow White.

01:18:40.470 --> 01:18:43.281
And so we have every
gradation, so we all

01:18:43.281 --> 01:18:44.780
look like we stepped
off the nickel.

01:18:50.510 --> 01:18:53.200
We've got to come to
grips with what is really

01:18:53.200 --> 01:18:54.905
being part of our community.

01:18:54.905 --> 01:18:58.220
It's Not passing the,
what's the litmus test?

01:18:58.220 --> 01:19:00.990
I don't think there is one,
because you can pass the test

01:19:00.990 --> 01:19:03.680
and put out your
hand for the check.

01:19:03.680 --> 01:19:06.800
So we've got to figure
out how to engage

01:19:06.800 --> 01:19:08.983
our people in an authentic way.

01:19:13.240 --> 01:19:14.170
- Yes

01:19:14.170 --> 01:19:14.839
- Hi there.

01:19:14.839 --> 01:19:15.880
My name is Lover Trussin.

01:19:15.880 --> 01:19:18.550
I'm tribal counseling
for the Nipmuc nation.

01:19:18.550 --> 01:19:24.760
And for our band, for our
nation, we used descend-ency.

01:19:24.760 --> 01:19:26.560
With that is community.

01:19:26.560 --> 01:19:28.300
So I was wondering
if descend-ency

01:19:28.300 --> 01:19:30.670
was an option for
any of your nations,

01:19:30.670 --> 01:19:33.658
and how do you define community?

01:19:37.350 --> 01:19:39.627
That's one of the
definitions for membership.

01:19:39.627 --> 01:19:41.460
So I was wondering if
that's the definition,

01:19:41.460 --> 01:19:43.450
how would you define that?

01:19:43.450 --> 01:19:47.790
- So, the citizen Pottawatomie
nation does use descend-ency

01:19:47.790 --> 01:19:50.230
as its enrollment criterion.

01:19:50.230 --> 01:19:55.980
So as long as our roll of
record is the 1937 roll,

01:19:55.980 --> 01:19:59.730
and as long as you can prove
an unbroken descend-ency

01:19:59.730 --> 01:20:02.670
from that roll, then
you are considered

01:20:02.670 --> 01:20:05.440
a member of the citizen,
or a citizen of the citizen

01:20:05.440 --> 01:20:08.690
Pottawatomie nation.

01:20:08.690 --> 01:20:11.600
The definition of
community is a lot harder.

01:20:11.600 --> 01:20:15.710
Because I do think as
other panelists have said,

01:20:15.710 --> 01:20:18.230
that requires an action.

01:20:18.230 --> 01:20:21.350
That requires active
participation.

01:20:21.350 --> 01:20:24.420
And at least for the
citizen Pottawatomie nation,

01:20:24.420 --> 01:20:29.060
that's something that people
come to at different points

01:20:29.060 --> 01:20:30.560
in their lives.

01:20:30.560 --> 01:20:33.310
There are people who are in
their 50s who are now starting

01:20:33.310 --> 01:20:34.560
to connect to their community.

01:20:34.560 --> 01:20:37.220
And so we try to have
resources available for them,

01:20:37.220 --> 01:20:40.922
and try to refrain
from judging them.

01:20:40.922 --> 01:20:42.380
But that's the
point of their lives

01:20:42.380 --> 01:20:44.546
where they're wanting to
connect to their community.

01:20:44.546 --> 01:20:46.460
Whereas, we have some
who are born into it.

01:20:46.460 --> 01:20:51.220
But I think community, for
me, is defined by action.

01:20:51.220 --> 01:20:57.830
- So I, for college students, I
look for return on investment.

01:20:57.830 --> 01:21:01.560
So if you accept that benefit,
the check for financial aid

01:21:01.560 --> 01:21:04.350
or scholarship, you have
a responsibility back

01:21:04.350 --> 01:21:07.720
to that party in some fashion.

01:21:07.720 --> 01:21:10.297
So community means engagement.

01:21:10.297 --> 01:21:12.630
I mean, we have people living
in California that haven't

01:21:12.630 --> 01:21:15.720
been home in three generations.

01:21:15.720 --> 01:21:19.050
And I don't see them
part of the community.

01:21:19.050 --> 01:21:22.330
They may be technically
and legally enrolled,

01:21:22.330 --> 01:21:27.090
but at the same time-
My first job as a native

01:21:27.090 --> 01:21:29.782
is to protect the homeland.

01:21:29.782 --> 01:21:31.240
How do I make the
community better?

01:21:31.240 --> 01:21:35.070
Now if there's benefits that
accrue to that, that's fine.

01:21:35.070 --> 01:21:37.350
But the benefits
don't come first.

01:21:37.350 --> 01:21:41.260
It's how do I make
the nation better?

01:21:41.260 --> 01:21:43.490
And that's my
responsibility as a citizen.

01:21:46.120 --> 01:21:49.320
And I suppose identity
really is on a continuum.

01:21:49.320 --> 01:21:54.585
We've got from can they count to
ten, or one little, two little,

01:21:54.585 --> 01:21:55.460
three Little Indians.

01:21:55.460 --> 01:21:58.850
Or you got somebody,
a sundance chief

01:21:58.850 --> 01:22:01.640
that practices who we are.

01:22:01.640 --> 01:22:03.950
I mean, so everybody's on
the continuum someplace.

01:22:03.950 --> 01:22:06.770
But it's a lifelong
process, the identity.

01:22:06.770 --> 01:22:09.890
And so you've got to,
as a tribe, as a nation,

01:22:09.890 --> 01:22:15.340
you have to figure out how you
get your citizens to engage.

01:22:17.900 --> 01:22:19.880
So it's not about bingo.

01:22:19.880 --> 01:22:22.999
- If I can step out of
my role of moderator

01:22:22.999 --> 01:22:24.790
just for a second to
join in that question,

01:22:24.790 --> 01:22:27.710
cause it's a very good question.

01:22:27.710 --> 01:22:29.390
Shelly Mitchell, when
she introduced me,

01:22:29.390 --> 01:22:31.880
I'm from the United home
nation in Louisiana.

01:22:31.880 --> 01:22:35.900
We're not federally recognized,
but there's a whole other layer

01:22:35.900 --> 01:22:40.550
of discussion there.There's
over 100 tribes that share

01:22:40.550 --> 01:22:44.150
that status, including
many here in New England.

01:22:44.150 --> 01:22:48.440
Who through luck of, or accident
of history, and so forth.

01:22:48.440 --> 01:22:51.500
But we still have
those same challenges

01:22:51.500 --> 01:22:53.630
in terms of what
is the community,

01:22:53.630 --> 01:22:57.510
and how do we assess belonging?

01:22:57.510 --> 01:23:01.880
So here I am, a New Englander,
having moved up back up here

01:23:01.880 --> 01:23:04.040
in '86.

01:23:04.040 --> 01:23:07.280
But as Norbert said, my
understanding of community.

01:23:07.280 --> 01:23:10.850
There's not a day that I
don't wake up and I think--

01:23:10.850 --> 01:23:13.490
besides what I'm going to have
for breakfast that morning--

01:23:13.490 --> 01:23:17.590
is how is my community doing?

01:23:17.590 --> 01:23:19.430
What is my community doing?

01:23:19.430 --> 01:23:21.640
And what can I do to
help my community?

01:23:21.640 --> 01:23:24.910
So I'm still, there is this
sort of elastic understanding

01:23:24.910 --> 01:23:26.770
of what my community means.

01:23:26.770 --> 01:23:30.670
I think for those of us who
practice our indigeneity

01:23:30.670 --> 01:23:31.510
in exile.

01:23:31.510 --> 01:23:34.060
In other words, we're
not in our homelands,

01:23:34.060 --> 01:23:36.280
but the homelands
are still here.

01:23:36.280 --> 01:23:38.080
And that's very real for us.

01:23:38.080 --> 01:23:40.387
I guess that would be
the conversation I would

01:23:40.387 --> 01:23:41.470
want to have with someone.

01:23:41.470 --> 01:23:45.370
Is, is that homeland residing
within you in a very real way?

01:23:45.370 --> 01:23:49.330
And is there a community
that you can go back to,

01:23:49.330 --> 01:23:52.740
and knows who you
are understands you?

01:23:52.740 --> 01:23:55.360
And that sense of
community, I think,

01:23:55.360 --> 01:23:58.480
is something around
which we have

01:23:58.480 --> 01:24:01.766
to grasp with because
of our mobile society.

01:24:01.766 --> 01:24:03.807
I think we have time for
maybe one more question.

01:24:08.950 --> 01:24:12.560
- I have probably too much to
say, but I'm not a non native,

01:24:12.560 --> 01:24:16.330
I've been a native rights
supporter for over 35 years.

01:24:16.330 --> 01:24:19.430
And I'm part of the
local native community.

01:24:19.430 --> 01:24:21.670
Every couple of years I
have to remind everybody

01:24:21.670 --> 01:24:24.290
that I'm not native.

01:24:24.290 --> 01:24:28.890
And I've been accused of
trying to pass for non-native.

01:24:28.890 --> 01:24:31.850
I may be be only person
that's ever happened to.

01:24:31.850 --> 01:24:38.810
But I think that there's
a parallel- well what

01:24:38.810 --> 01:24:42.190
is with natives, I think,
is about self-determination.

01:24:42.190 --> 01:24:43.950
And that's why I call
myself a supporter.

01:24:43.950 --> 01:24:45.920
That's my role.

01:24:45.920 --> 01:24:52.100
But I myself, am
a Jewish atheist.

01:24:52.100 --> 01:24:57.170
And 100%, so I know
I'm not part native.

01:24:57.170 --> 01:25:01.700
But I've had people look at
me and say, you look native.

01:25:01.700 --> 01:25:05.450
And finally, it occurred
to me a few years ago,

01:25:05.450 --> 01:25:10.880
that I'm part Morsh
and I'm part Kazak.

01:25:10.880 --> 01:25:13.250
And you can see
it looking at me.

01:25:13.250 --> 01:25:21.380
And in fact, by the conventional
definitions, I'm not white.

01:25:21.380 --> 01:25:24.530
And I went through
a identity crisis,

01:25:24.530 --> 01:25:27.790
and realized I had grown
up being considered white,

01:25:27.790 --> 01:25:31.340
I consider myself white,
I have white privilege.

01:25:31.340 --> 01:25:31.970
I'm white.

01:25:31.970 --> 01:25:37.550
It seems pretty obvious
when I think it through.

01:25:37.550 --> 01:25:39.770
Anyway, I am interested
in the whole thing

01:25:39.770 --> 01:25:41.690
of dividing and
conquering, starting

01:25:41.690 --> 01:25:44.720
with things like
assuming that tribes

01:25:44.720 --> 01:25:49.820
are of course patrilineal.

01:25:49.820 --> 01:25:55.250
And setting up tribal councils
that are of men and so forth.

01:25:58.320 --> 01:26:00.540
- For, go on, go on.

01:26:00.540 --> 01:26:02.500
- I was just going to
jump in really quickly.

01:26:02.500 --> 01:26:07.560
So I work in education
within my tribe.

01:26:07.560 --> 01:26:09.600
And so do a lot of
sessions on identity

01:26:09.600 --> 01:26:11.850
with college students or
high school and middle school

01:26:11.850 --> 01:26:12.350
students.

01:26:12.350 --> 01:26:15.540
And one exercise
that we often do

01:26:15.540 --> 01:26:17.790
with Native American students,
not just Pottawatomie,

01:26:17.790 --> 01:26:18.930
but others in Oklahoma.

01:26:18.930 --> 01:26:21.150
We have a lot of
different tribes.

01:26:21.150 --> 01:26:24.550
We ask students to describe what
a Native American person looks

01:26:24.550 --> 01:26:25.050
like.

01:26:25.050 --> 01:26:29.100
And what they wear, and
how they wear their hair.

01:26:29.100 --> 01:26:32.730
And then inevitably,
as they describe

01:26:32.730 --> 01:26:34.710
that, when we go around
the room and look

01:26:34.710 --> 01:26:37.640
at all the natives in the
room, nobody looks like that.

01:26:37.640 --> 01:26:39.360
And there isn't one
definition for how

01:26:39.360 --> 01:26:41.470
a Native American person looks.

01:26:41.470 --> 01:26:45.990
And because, as we talked about
today, it is a citizenship,

01:26:45.990 --> 01:26:48.090
there's no one way that
an American citizen looks.

01:26:48.090 --> 01:26:50.298
There's no one way that a
Pottawatomie citizen looks.

01:26:50.298 --> 01:26:53.070
So there's a really
wide variation there.

01:26:53.070 --> 01:26:54.987
There's no one way
of looking native.

01:26:54.987 --> 01:26:56.820
It's something that I
think a lot of natives

01:26:56.820 --> 01:26:59.400
even struggle with.

01:26:59.400 --> 01:27:03.676
- I was just going to say,
thank you for being an ally.

01:27:03.676 --> 01:27:04.800
Sometimes we don't do that.

01:27:04.800 --> 01:27:07.860
We expect a lot from our allies,
but we never say thank you.

01:27:07.860 --> 01:27:13.500
But also, I've talked to several
Indian students for years,

01:27:13.500 --> 01:27:15.446
and if an ally hit
them upside the head,

01:27:15.446 --> 01:27:16.570
they wouldn't recognize it.

01:27:16.570 --> 01:27:19.692
So we have to teach our people
how to recognize allies.

01:27:19.692 --> 01:27:21.400
They're not always
from your same family,

01:27:21.400 --> 01:27:23.250
same clan, same tribe.

01:27:23.250 --> 01:27:25.480
And sometimes those
guys are dream killers.

01:27:25.480 --> 01:27:28.120
And sometimes some
people will help.

01:27:28.120 --> 01:27:29.710
And so we have to
recognize this.

01:27:29.710 --> 01:27:33.280
So we've got to figure
what the partnerships are.

01:27:33.280 --> 01:27:38.110
But what I'm worried about is
that we may terminate ourselves

01:27:38.110 --> 01:27:41.280
with our own hand.

01:27:41.280 --> 01:27:43.420
So we may conquer
and divide ourselves.

01:27:43.420 --> 01:27:47.860
We don't need any help from
Donald Trump or anybody else.

01:27:47.860 --> 01:27:50.320
But also, there's a
question about giving back.

01:27:50.320 --> 01:27:52.510
And Olivia lives in California.

01:27:52.510 --> 01:27:54.850
But I think she thinks
of ways to figure out how

01:27:54.850 --> 01:27:57.040
to get back to the homeboys.

01:27:57.040 --> 01:27:59.690
I did that.

01:27:59.690 --> 01:28:03.220
If some people live
in Denver but they

01:28:03.220 --> 01:28:08.230
belong to Ogallala or Cherokee,
they can tutor Indian kids

01:28:08.230 --> 01:28:09.480
in Denver.

01:28:09.480 --> 01:28:12.090
And that's giving
back to the community.

01:28:12.090 --> 01:28:14.640
But you just can't
lose the thread

01:28:14.640 --> 01:28:16.430
that gives you to belong.

01:28:16.430 --> 01:28:19.000
So you can belong to an
urban committee or groups

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:22.350
like yourselves, and
that's always appreciated.

01:28:22.350 --> 01:28:24.800
So there's a way to get
your arms around it,

01:28:24.800 --> 01:28:28.700
but you have to be clever you
have to be willing to do it.

01:28:28.700 --> 01:28:32.050
- Norb, you as a role
model for Oneidas,

01:28:32.050 --> 01:28:34.150
you are the epitome
of someone who

01:28:34.150 --> 01:28:38.320
left, got amazing experience,
got amazing skills,

01:28:38.320 --> 01:28:39.700
came back to the tribe.

01:28:39.700 --> 01:28:42.010
You've just retired and
now are back in Oneida.

01:28:42.010 --> 01:28:43.800
I think that's the dream.

01:28:43.800 --> 01:28:45.490
That's what we hope
of our native youth.

01:28:45.490 --> 01:28:48.490
That they go off and they
do great amazing things,

01:28:48.490 --> 01:28:51.430
learn amazing things, and
then take those learnings back

01:28:51.430 --> 01:28:53.240
to our tribes and our homelands.

01:28:53.240 --> 01:28:55.840
- So I didn't know how much
Indian I was until I moved off

01:28:55.840 --> 01:28:56.884
the reservation.

01:28:56.884 --> 01:28:58.300
Because I'd have
to defend it, you

01:28:58.300 --> 01:29:01.450
know at home, just to get
to be one of the guys.

01:29:01.450 --> 01:29:04.690
So you have to defend it when
you're there and say, you know.

01:29:04.690 --> 01:29:08.290
- Kind of the point on
being Indian in exile.

01:29:08.290 --> 01:29:10.660
I think when you
are in the place,

01:29:10.660 --> 01:29:12.520
the place kind of
gives you the reason.

01:29:12.520 --> 01:29:15.740
You are, when I'm
Oneida in Oneida,

01:29:15.740 --> 01:29:16.990
it's a lot easier to question.

01:29:16.990 --> 01:29:20.420
When I'm outside of Oneida,
that looks a lot different.

01:29:20.420 --> 01:29:22.390
And I think it forces
you into citizenship

01:29:22.390 --> 01:29:23.800
because you have to be active.

01:29:23.800 --> 01:29:28.724
And you can't rely on the place
to give you your identity.

01:29:28.724 --> 01:29:30.140
- And we'll turn
it over to Megan.

01:29:30.140 --> 01:29:32.600
- Hi everybody, I'm Megan Hill.

01:29:32.600 --> 01:29:34.270
Although you may
have heard a nickname

01:29:34.270 --> 01:29:36.120
if you were paying
attention, due to my father's

01:29:36.120 --> 01:29:36.994
love of Van Morrison.

01:29:39.460 --> 01:29:42.100
I really just want to thank
you all for being here

01:29:42.100 --> 01:29:45.280
and coming together
and joining us

01:29:45.280 --> 01:29:49.600
to have a really profound
and important conversation

01:29:49.600 --> 01:29:53.560
about what it means to be a
citizen of a native nation.

01:29:53.560 --> 01:29:56.950
And what it means to be an
indigenous person in this world

01:29:56.950 --> 01:29:57.500
today.

01:29:57.500 --> 01:30:02.170
So my hope is that we left you
with many, many more questions

01:30:02.170 --> 01:30:03.550
than answers.

01:30:03.550 --> 01:30:06.620
And that you really think
more deeply about this.

01:30:06.620 --> 01:30:11.440
And help us all move
forward collectively.

01:30:11.440 --> 01:30:14.156
So I would like to thank the
Radcliffe Institute, Shawn

01:30:14.156 --> 01:30:18.040
and Becky, I would like to thank
Hunap and the Harvard Project.

01:30:18.040 --> 01:30:19.750
And most importantly,
I would love

01:30:19.750 --> 01:30:21.490
to thank our panel here today.

01:30:21.490 --> 01:30:26.030
Bruce Duthu, Olivia Hoeft,
Tesia Zientek and Norbert Hill,

01:30:26.030 --> 01:30:28.240
who's also my father.

01:30:28.240 --> 01:30:33.460
So join us for a reception and
thank you all for being here.
