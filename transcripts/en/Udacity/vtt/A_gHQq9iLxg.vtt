Hi, I'm here with Richard Fulcher.

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:05.850
Richard is a UX Designer at Google.

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:06.930
Senior UX Designer?

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.370
&gt;&gt; That's right
&gt;&gt; And has been working on UX for

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:11.480
the last 15 years.

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:12.720
Thank you for joining us, Richard.

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:15.340
&gt;&gt; Oh, it's a pleasure to be here today,
thanks for having me.

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:18.940
&gt;&gt; To get started, can you describe
what user experience design is?

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:23.840
&gt;&gt; Sure, it's a big umbrella
of several related disciplines

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:28.180
that are all focused on
the design of experiences

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.630
to help a individual person
achieve some kind of goal.

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.642
And that covers a lot of different
types of experiences, most commonly we

00:00:37.642 --> 00:00:42.173
think about software design, but it's
also things like environment design, and

00:00:42.173 --> 00:00:44.392
maybe the design of physical products.

00:00:44.392 --> 00:00:47.271
It can even be things
like event coordination.

00:00:47.271 --> 00:00:50.902
It's kind of anything
that a user experiences,

00:00:50.902 --> 00:00:53.770
that can be constructed for them.

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:57.760
When I was kind of first taught this,
there was kind of five key concepts.

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.250
It's the study of users and
their context,

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.840
kind of the environment they operate in,
in order that we can design tools for

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.370
them achieve tasks that
let them complete goals.

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:15.070
So users, contexts, tasks.

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:15.620
&gt;&gt; And goals.

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:16.770
&gt;&gt; Goals.

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.550
&gt;&gt; Okay, so let's start with the user.

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:19.900
Who are they?

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.520
Well, the user is anyone

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.890
who's going to use the product of
the service that you're designing.

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:31.200
And it's really important to remember
that, that runs a really wide range.

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.080
It's very easy to kind of,
when you're designing,

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.685
just think about designing for yourself.

00:01:36.685 --> 00:01:40.820
For this one super idealized
user that you have in mind.

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.060
But in reality,
you're going to be building this for

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.130
people with very different
levels of experience.

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:51.130
With different contexts and
different backgrounds that affect

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:54.810
how they'll perceive this
thing that you built for them.

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.490
&gt;&gt; How do I know who the user is?

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:00.335
&gt;&gt; The key for
that is something called user research.

00:02:00.335 --> 00:02:03.990
I think it's kind of most
associated with this idea of,

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.389
taking this product you're working
on and testing it in some way,

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:14.710
having a user come in and try to perform
a series of tasks that you assign them.

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:18.360
And see how they do and see the things
that are problems for them.

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.390
But user research really
covers the whole end-to-end

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:22.950
development of the product.

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.984
Even before you've drawn
your first screen,

00:02:25.984 --> 00:02:30.883
you can engage with user research to
go into your potential users' homes or

00:02:30.883 --> 00:02:35.397
workplaces, to start to understand
that context that's important

00:02:35.397 --> 00:02:38.853
to the way that they behave and
what their goals are.

00:02:38.853 --> 00:02:41.747
And once you've even kind
of finished and shipped,

00:02:41.747 --> 00:02:45.560
you can do things like look at logs and
try to analyze usage patterns,

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.076
see what people are doing
with your product.

00:02:48.076 --> 00:02:51.865
Perhaps kind of bias towards things
that you want them to do more of, or

00:02:51.865 --> 00:02:56.249
see areas that they're spending a lot of
time in that you haven't anticipated.
