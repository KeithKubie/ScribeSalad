- Yeah mom, I'm
really digging it.

00:00:06.372 --> 00:00:09.275 align:start size:81% position:19%
Yeah, no it's fun,
it's nice out.

00:00:09.275 --> 00:00:13.112
No I haven't joined a gang,
I don't think I'll do that.

00:00:13.112 --> 00:00:15.348
Rick's good, yeah.

00:00:15.348 --> 00:00:17.216
Yeah, he's soberish.

00:00:17.216 --> 00:00:19.552
Yeah, my knees holding
out, oh, okay, I'll talk

00:00:19.552 --> 00:00:20.387
to you later mom.

00:00:20.387 --> 00:00:21.621
Bye, I love you.

00:00:21.621 --> 00:00:22.588
- Comedy open mic
tomorrow night,

00:00:22.588 --> 00:00:24.189
come check it out or try it out.

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:27.293
First timers get on for sure.

00:00:27.293 --> 00:00:30.229
- Well I won't be trying it
out, I'm a dramatic actor,

00:00:30.229 --> 00:00:31.898
I just moved to town.

00:00:31.898 --> 00:00:33.632
Very very serious stuff.

00:00:33.632 --> 00:00:37.937
- Okay, so Robin Williams,
Jim Carrey and Jamie Foxx

00:00:37.937 --> 00:00:39.805
never did both?

00:00:39.805 --> 00:00:43.643 align:start size:84% position:16%
Wake up man, expand
your range bro.

00:00:46.746 --> 00:00:48.314
- Yeah, good point.

00:00:50.116 --> 00:00:52.752 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Come back and
expand that range bro.

00:00:52.752 --> 00:00:55.088
(rap music)

00:01:03.663 --> 00:01:05.765 align:start size:94% position:6%
- I thought you were going
to be a dramatic actor.

00:01:05.765 --> 00:01:07.733
- It's called range bro.

00:01:07.733 --> 00:01:09.835 align:start size:84% position:16%
Look at Jim Carrey,
Robin Williams,

00:01:09.835 --> 00:01:12.238
Academy Award winner Jamie Foxx.

00:01:12.238 --> 00:01:14.240 align:start size:84% position:16%
They all had it dude,
I could do that.

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:15.641
I was class clown.

00:01:15.641 --> 00:01:18.344
- No you weren't,
I was class clown.

00:01:18.344 --> 00:01:22.114
- Rick, you weren't in class,
you were a parking lot clown.

00:01:22.114 --> 00:01:24.117 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Of course I'm gonna be there
bro, you're gonna kill it.

00:01:24.117 --> 00:01:25.452
I got you.

00:01:25.452 --> 00:01:26.351
- Thanks man.

00:01:26.351 --> 00:01:29.288
- Does open mic mean open bar?

00:01:29.288 --> 00:01:30.123
- No
- Oh

00:01:31.324 --> 00:01:33.292
- So I was riding in
a cab the other day

00:01:33.292 --> 00:01:35.695
and I was super high right

00:01:35.695 --> 00:01:37.797
and the cab driver asked me,

00:01:37.797 --> 00:01:40.333
"Where you going?"
And I start talking

00:01:40.333 --> 00:01:44.103
like Matthew McConaughey

00:01:44.103 --> 00:01:48.040
and so I respond,
"Alright, alright,

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:49.342
"alright"

00:01:49.342 --> 00:01:51.444
(laughs)

00:01:52.478 --> 00:01:54.513
- That dude's hilarious.

00:01:54.513 --> 00:01:56.215
Good luck following that shit.

00:01:56.215 --> 00:01:57.483
- How many beers have you had?

00:01:57.483 --> 00:01:59.185
- Six, but I did a bub
of coke in the bathroom

00:01:59.185 --> 00:02:00.453
so I'm good.

00:02:00.453 --> 00:02:03.189 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Great. Look man, maybe
this was a bad idea.

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:05.692
- What? Dude we came all
the way down here together.

00:02:05.692 --> 00:02:07.160
You got this.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:08.127 align:start size:94% position:6%
- I know, it's just I
overheard that those guys

00:02:08.127 --> 00:02:10.829
in the suits are big agents.

00:02:10.829 --> 00:02:12.298 align:start size:84% position:16%
- So he looks kinda
Chinese though.

00:02:12.298 --> 00:02:14.667 align:start size:94% position:6%
- That's the dud I did
coke with in the bathroom!

00:02:14.667 --> 00:02:16.669 align:start size:84% position:16%
- You guys ready
for your next comic?

00:02:16.669 --> 00:02:19.672
This guy is new to town,
he wants to be an actor.

00:02:19.672 --> 00:02:21.507
Give it up for Gary Scouser.

00:02:21.507 --> 00:02:22.675 align:start size:84% position:16%
- You got this buddy,
eye of the tiger.

00:02:22.675 --> 00:02:24.076 align:start size:84% position:16%
I'll be in the crowd
supporting you.

00:02:24.076 --> 00:02:24.910
- Okay, I got it.

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:26.012
Feel better

00:02:26.012 --> 00:02:29.048
(scattered applause)

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:32.885
Hey everybody, how are ya?

00:02:32.885 --> 00:02:34.721
That's a warm welcome.

00:02:35.754 --> 00:02:37.890
Let's get started.

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:42.495
Yeah, my name is Gary,
I'm new to Los Angeles

00:02:42.495 --> 00:02:44.863
and traffic is not great,

00:02:44.863 --> 00:02:46.699
we all know that.

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:48.701
I'm not used to it yet.

00:02:48.701 --> 00:02:50.570
(boos)

00:02:52.705 --> 00:02:55.174
(nervous chuckle)

00:02:55.174 --> 00:02:57.877
Yeah, (stutters)

00:02:59.545 --> 00:03:01.180
- Oh wow, great material,

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.950 align:start size:84% position:16%
let me guess, airplane
food is so bad.

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.219
(laughs)

00:03:07.219 --> 00:03:08.054
- Rick.

00:03:11.591 --> 00:03:13.125
- Hey, nice haircut.

00:03:13.125 --> 00:03:16.128
What time is the barbecue
in Ohio, you fucking Dork.

00:03:16.128 --> 00:03:18.231
(laughs)

00:03:25.137 --> 00:03:26.105
(stutters)

00:03:26.105 --> 00:03:27.373
Hey, nice gut.

00:03:27.373 --> 00:03:29.241
What Dunkin Donuts
you work out at?

00:03:29.241 --> 00:03:31.277
(laughs)

00:03:34.813 --> 00:03:37.750
- Yeah, why don't you get AIDS.

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:39.618
(audience gasps)

00:03:39.618 --> 00:03:41.921
(boos)

00:03:41.921 --> 00:03:43.922
- I have AIDS.

00:03:43.922 --> 00:03:45.558
- Are you alright?

00:03:45.558 --> 00:03:47.626 align:start size:94% position:6%
You'll never get an agent
in this fucking town.

00:03:47.626 --> 00:03:49.095
- I didn't know--

00:03:53.832 --> 00:03:56.402
(slow clap)

00:03:56.402 --> 00:03:59.305 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Alright, that
was Gary everybody.

00:04:06.011 --> 00:04:07.013
- Oh my God.

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:12.118
- Ah there he is,
dude you killed--

00:04:12.118 --> 00:04:15.187 align:start size:81% position:19%
- What in the fuck
are you doing?

00:04:15.187 --> 00:04:17.256
Why did you heckle me?

00:04:17.256 --> 00:04:18.490
- What do you mean?

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:20.292
I came for support
just like I said.

00:04:20.292 --> 00:04:22.028 align:start size:81% position:19%
I got your back
dude, we're a duo.

00:04:22.028 --> 00:04:24.163
You know, like how
we are in real life.

00:04:24.163 --> 00:04:27.533
- You didn't let me get
out a joke, not one joke.

00:04:27.533 --> 00:04:31.303
They fucking booed me and then
the agents walked out angry.

00:04:31.303 --> 00:04:32.638
Great!

00:04:32.638 --> 00:04:33.973
- Yeah, you made
fun of their AIDS.

00:04:33.973 --> 00:04:35.307
- I didn't fucking,

00:04:35.307 --> 00:04:37.109
I don't even know
if they have AIDS.

00:04:37.109 --> 00:04:38.610
I just blurted it out.

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:40.145
That's a horrible thing to say

00:04:40.145 --> 00:04:43.516
about anybody if they do or
they don't have fucking AUDS.

00:04:43.516 --> 00:04:45.351 align:start size:84% position:16%
- You should just
calm down, relax bro,

00:04:45.351 --> 00:04:46.785
it's gonna be okay.

00:04:46.785 --> 00:04:49.288
Listen, you're a dramatic actor.

00:04:49.288 --> 00:04:50.990
Comedy isn't easy dude,

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:52.491
it's just not your thing.

00:04:52.491 --> 00:04:55.628 align:start size:97% position:3%
- I wouldn't know that because
I couldn't get out one joke

00:04:55.628 --> 00:04:57.530
so I don't know that.

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:59.365
- Sorry bro my bad.

00:04:59.365 --> 00:05:01.734 align:start size:97% position:3%
Let's just go get a drink
and forget about how terrible

00:05:01.734 --> 00:05:03.368
that was okay?

00:05:03.368 --> 00:05:05.571
- You said it was fine though.

00:05:05.571 --> 00:05:08.007 align:start size:94% position:6%
- Hey, sorry to interrupt,
that was so great.

00:05:08.007 --> 00:05:09.675
You were so funny in there.

00:05:09.675 --> 00:05:10.910
- Thanks man I mean--

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:13.312
- No, no, no not
you, your friend.

00:05:13.312 --> 00:05:15.347 align:start size:84% position:16%
What's you name man?
- Rick.

00:05:15.347 --> 00:05:18.017 align:start size:97% position:3%
- You were hysterical, you're
my new favorite comedian.

00:05:18.017 --> 00:05:19.352
- Oh, thank you.

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:22.355
- Boo!

00:05:23.856 --> 00:05:26.225
(trap music)
