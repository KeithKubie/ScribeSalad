00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:02.440
 Danish sounds strange. 

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:04.000
 Like a throat lick. 

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.130
 As if Danes are holding a cough back. 

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:08.850
 Or maybe a potato is stuck in their necks 

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:12.630
 Obviously ... that's what everyone is telling me. 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:13.710
 But why? 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.120
 Why does Danish sound so fun to people? 

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:26.660
 I have recently discovered how Swedes, Norwegians and Danes can all communicate without 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.380
 to change language. 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.989
 But this was not fair and uniform - some languages ​​were easier to understand than others. 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:39.890
 The Internet eagerly pointed its finger in one language in particular: Danish. 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:42.940
 I submit a video and are told that Danish is a joke. 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.889
 I log on to social media and read about the potato in their neck. 

00:00:46.889 --> 00:00:50.730
 I visit a discussion forum and it's a "stray goose". 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:57.199
 A study tells me that Swedish children regard Danish as being uglier and more strange than Danes consider Swedish. 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:01.160
 Of course, some of it is "crazy" and "good-natured teasing". 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:05.890
 But even though I take it all with a spruce salt-marinated herring, I still have to ask: What makes Danish 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:07.830
 Sounds ridiculous? 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.510
 Maybe I could add my own theory. 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.170
 I blame the Danish butter for their pastries. 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:17.510
 But no, this is NativLang, so you already know what we need to do: sift 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:24.120
 The story of the Danish language, to uncover what exactly makes this language's pronunciation stand out. 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:27.420
 So Danish is notoriously difficult to learn to pronounce. 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:30.830
 You will hear me try, but will someone be so sweet to back me up. 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:32.920
 Red porridge with cream. 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:34.300
 Well, okay! 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:39.920
 Let's travel back in time that was once 1300 years ago: 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:45.660
 Denmark spoke an Indo-European Germanic language with a special Nordic touch, 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:47.960
 as we call Old Norse. 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:52.740
 For them, it was the "Danish tongue", the Danish tongue (the Danish language). 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.350
 Everywhere in Scandinavia it is a time of unity. 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:59.610
 Wherever you go, Nordic sounds like Nordic. 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.860
 But soon these Danish tongues will be left unresolved and will be upgraded to Viking status. 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.790
 During the Viking Age, something will change. 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:10.179
 It starts in Denmark. 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:16.599
 A Dane, probably many Danes, but at least this one, decides "I will pronounce my vowels 

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:22.620
 differently ", which leads to the fact that eastern Nordic differs from the western Danish. 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:28.130
 It's the start of a trend, the perfect setup for the rest of our story: Hey, everyone 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:30.940
 there was another sound change in Dnamark. 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:36.280
 At this point, over a thousand years ago, we can officially call it "Denmark", 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:37.800
 the borderlands of the Danes. 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.700
 See! This rune stone says it. 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.610
 The Vikings settle down. 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:44.639
 The Middle Ages settle down. 

00:02:44.639 --> 00:02:49.609
 At this time, Scandinavia is a continuum of dialects, which can easily trace their origins 

00:02:49.609 --> 00:02:51.550
 to the east and west. 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:56.609
 Oh and it too often forgot Old Guns on its own island, where vowels at times 

00:02:56.609 --> 00:03:00.749
 neither corresponded to western or eastern nordic 

00:03:00.749 --> 00:03:03.670
 Officially, however, this is a Latin era. 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:05.639
 Not very much written Nordic. 

00:03:05.639 --> 00:03:11.019
 Until Denmark begins to behave medieval and write down the Skåne law. 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:16.060
 Thanks to printers who copied it, this law is available in several editions, including this cool 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:17.749
 edition in runes. 

00:03:17.749 --> 00:03:24.270
 Its words show another Danish change: pressure-weak vowels are weakened. 

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:29.200
 That is the reason why the well-known endings of Swedes and Norwegian all 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.659
 Danish becomes / ə /, / ə /, / ə /! 

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:38.200
 Meanwhile, the Hanseatic League unites itself to dominate the continent's northern coast, 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:43.650
 which leads to a war and many new words from medieval German. 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:45.820
 Or Mittelniederdeutsch. 

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:46.840
 Ha. 

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:52.710
 Meanwhile, another change is taking place in Denmark: consonants become softer, 

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:58.459
 whereby [t] softens to [ð] i / matr / to food. 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:00.819
 This is lenition. 

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:07.160
 It's a normal change (just ask Spanish), but strangely enough, Danes do it at the end of syllables. 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:12.380
 Consonants and depressed vowels become weakened, but pressure-enhancing vowels multiply. 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:18.100
 When counting, Danish ends up with more distinct vowels than, possibly, some other language. 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:21.410
 So this is a Danish that gets different. 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:23.030
 We are on the trail of something. 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:27.250
 But on the "sounds ridiculous" scale, so far I will count on being a "chatterer". 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:29.430
 So far. 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:31.450
 It's 1526. 

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:36.670
 A Swede writes that Danes sound "as if they are about to cough," turns words into theirs 

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:40.100
 throat "," twists and twists them ". 

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:42.760
 What is this hoax? 

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:47.860
 Will not know it for the next two centuries, after which a Danish grammar writes in 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:50.480
 Concordia res parve crescunt ... (Second Test of Danish Orthography). 

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:53.620
 (Hey, at least my Latin works - besides, it's a bold title). 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:59.420
 Well, this book describes how Danes pronounce many syllables with "a very little hiccup". 

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:05.820
 A little hiccup with a bold name, a "shock". 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:08.790
 The shock to the neck is not one sound. 

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:10.940
 It sums up a whole process. 

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:16.840
 A complicated process with many phases and a lot of anatomy that happens in your neck. 

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:19.520
 But it is also not on every syllable. 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:24.060
 These do not have: "tear", "do". 

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:28.700
 But these have: "wounds", "die". 

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:34.870
 It has been called creaking, cough-like and let's not forget, a constant stream of very small hiccups. 

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:40.390
 And it is crucial if you ever want to master the real Danish accent. 

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:45.640
 At the same time, as this author writes about hiccups, another sound change takes place in Denmark. 

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:48.720
 For once, however, it is not Danish's fault. 

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:56.550
 Danish had retained a rolling Nordic "R". But a new "R" spreads through France and Germany, 

00:05:56.550 --> 00:06:02.530
 a dramatic change that deserves its own story, the so-called "scar-r" (throat-R). Instead of a tongue tip, 

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:06.740
 rolled / r / is it a rear-in-mouth / ʁ /. 

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:12.300
 Denmark got a bad case of this creep, whose symptoms include changing words like / reddish /. 

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:16.320
 To, uh, this: red porridge. 

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:19.960
 The result is an even more high Danish. 

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:21.620
 We're almost there. 

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:26.700
 Almost, because they have all the right sounds ... in Copenhagen. 

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:30.260
 But Scandinavia is a rich mosaic of dialects. 

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:35.890
 Sweden wants to keep its many variants, including a prehistoric form of gutnisk. 

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:40.400
 In Norway, there is still no single spoken Norwegian. 

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:46.030
 But back in Denmark, the old dialects, some of which have never had bumps, will attend 

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:52.310
 one last change: the traditional dialects will mostly disappear. 

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:57.210
 We end up with almost all of Denmark speaking one language, a language with the simplest 

00:06:57.210 --> 00:07:02.310
 grammatical endings in Scandinavia, weakened consonants, perhaps the largest number 

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:07.120
 vowels in the world and small hiccups / / s. 

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:12.180
 And this is how the Danes went from speaking Nordic so well to everyone else to sound 

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:13.910
 incredibly strange. 

00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:16.580
 Or oddly incredible. 

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:19.560
