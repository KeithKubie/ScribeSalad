00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.230
Get rich or die alone.

00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:04.125
The stakes have never
been so high, you guys.

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:10.860
Hey, everyone.

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:11.680
Laci Green here.

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:13.540
It's been a while since we
talked about online dating here

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:15.831
on DNews, but a new study
that's getting some attention

00:00:15.831 --> 00:00:16.512
caught my eye.

00:00:16.512 --> 00:00:18.470
Scientists are claiming
that-- prepare yourself

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:22.510
for this one-- online daters
with an income of over $150,000

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:26.150
per year get a crap load more
messages from potential dates.

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:28.720
For men, they were 82%
more likely to get messages

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.790
if they made over $150K
than if they made $20K,

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:34.620
and for women, they were
65% percent more likely,

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.212
which suggests that
money can in fact,

00:00:36.212 --> 00:00:38.170
buy you love because all
everyone wants in life

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:39.985
is a sugar mama or a daddy.

00:00:39.985 --> 00:00:42.980
If you don't make 150K
per year, have no worries.

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.260
Most people don't including the
people that are claiming to.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.320
In analysis on OkCupid found
the average person lies

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.790
about their income by as
much as 20%, so in reality,

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:55.610
most of these folks are probably
making closer to $120,000

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:56.260
per year.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.260
The analysis found that
the exaggeration becomes

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.430
more pronounced as you
get older and that men

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:01.970
are more likely
to lie than women.

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:03.470
The other reason
you shouldn't worry

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:05.678
is that you don't have to
be in the top 5% of earners

00:01:05.678 --> 00:01:08.080
in the country to
succeed in online dating.

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.740
We found that starting
around $80,000 a year,

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.270
you'll start to get a lot
more messages than all

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:14.564
the lower income brackets.

00:01:14.564 --> 00:01:15.980
The folks who are
most screwed are

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:18.310
those who make $40,000
or lower because that's

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:20.142
when the messages really
start to drop off.

00:01:20.142 --> 00:01:21.850
So what are some of
the other groups that

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:24.310
have a winning edge in
the online dating world?

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:27.590
Well, being white certainly
helps if you're a man.

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:29.150
OkCupid found that
white men lead

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:31.441
the way in the number of
messages they receive compared

00:01:31.441 --> 00:01:32.750
to every other race of men.

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:34.250
For women, those
of Asian descent

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:35.990
lead the way in
messages received.

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.430
An analysis of two million
users on PlentyofFish

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.300
found that it's
very advantageous

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.130
to describe yourself as
having an athletic build.

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.650
This improves
responses by about 40%.

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:49.407
Also being Christian or Catholic
improve responses by about 30%.

00:01:49.407 --> 00:01:50.990
Overall though, the
greatest advantage

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:53.420
is to have those
dollars, which gives me

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:54.626
all kinds of mixed feelings.

00:01:54.626 --> 00:01:57.000
I mean, what happened to the
best thing in life are free,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.761
and you can't buy my love?

00:01:58.761 --> 00:02:01.260
I guess those mantras will have
to stick the Hallmark cards.

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:02.910
So why is this so
trying to begin with?

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:05.335
Evolutionary psychologists
say that class and income

00:02:05.335 --> 00:02:07.640
are valuable traits in a
mate because it tells us

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.182
about how much
resources someone has.

00:02:09.182 --> 00:02:11.723
The argument goes that the more
resources, the better they're

00:02:11.723 --> 00:02:13.110
able to care for
their offspring.

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.820
They can put a roof over their
kid's head, food on the table,

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:17.740
send them to college,
and essentially ensure

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:19.380
that their children
too will have

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:22.450
lots of resources, aka, money.

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.600
So maybe there's
something there or maybe

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.180
we've all been convinced
by our money-driven culture

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.394
that we'd be happier if we have
a giant house and fancy cars,

00:02:30.394 --> 00:02:32.310
which is [? oblique ?]
disputed by scientists,

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.037
but that's a story
for a different day.

00:02:34.037 --> 00:02:35.620
Thanks for joining
me for DNews, guys.

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:37.920
How much does income matter
to you when you date?

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.461
Let me know your
thoughts down below,

00:02:39.461 --> 00:02:41.640
and I'll catch you next time.
