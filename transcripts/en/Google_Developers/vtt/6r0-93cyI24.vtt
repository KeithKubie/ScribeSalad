[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.080
THUSHAN AMARASIRIWARDENA:
Good morning, everyone.

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.580
Thank you.

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:11.150
[CHEERING]

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:13.900
Thank you for coming so
bright and early on this 8:30.

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:17.610
And thank you for those
who are watching along.

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:21.220
We are so excited to have you
here because in the next 40

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:24.610
minutes, you will be
experts in making games

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:26.530
on the Google Assistant.

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:29.710
We're going to discuss why
we are serious about play

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:32.140
and why we think
you should be too,

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:34.787
and who is excited
to play these games.

00:00:34.787 --> 00:00:36.370
And then, we're going
to get into tips

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:39.280
of how, with words,
pixels, sounds,

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.110
and the code to make it happen.

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:43.120
And then lastly,
what you can do to be

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.440
found on the Google Assistant.

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.630
Before I go any further,
let me introduce myself.

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:49.980
I am Thushan.

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.600
I am a product manager
for fun and delight

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.120
on the Google Assistant.

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.980
And I'm joined by Andy.

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.270
He's also fun.

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.880
He's our team's creative lead.

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:04.500
And Ralfi, who is our product
manager on Dialogflow.

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.450
And while he doesn't
have fun in his title,

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.110
I can guarantee you he's fun.

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:16.500
We are a really big team of
writers, engineers, designers,

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.850
sound gurus who drive the
personality and delight

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.920
of the Google Assistant.

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.820
This team crafts how we respond
to lots of queries like tell me

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.750
a joke, to how are you doing,
or a surprisingly popular ,

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.300
one which is hey,
Google, I love you.

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:35.350
People say that.

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:38.700
And the reason we do this is
when you think of the Google

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.830
Assistant, everyone thinks
it's about getting things done.

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:44.040
And that is absolutely true.

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.010
We're here to make
your life easier.

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:51.510
But we're also here to
make it a lot more fun too.

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:55.260
And that's our little
slogan for our team.

00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:02.160
We build apps like a trivia game
called "Are you feeling lucky?"

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:04.650
And the reason we do
this is so that we

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:06.870
can learn how to
make these games

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:09.360
and make sure that
those APIs that you need

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.790
exist so that you
can go build them.

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.170
We also build templates.

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.860
And we worked with
BuzzFeed recently

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.560
to bring them on board
onto the Google Assistant.

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.689
And where you can find
out what dessert are you.

00:02:22.689 --> 00:02:25.230
You know, all those fun quizzes
that they have on their site,

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:29.380
now you can play through
the Google Assistant.

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:32.590
And we also work with
awesome startups,

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:36.700
like Volley, who made a game
called "King for a Day."

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.400
That's one of the first that
runs on these smart displays

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.260
that you've probably
seen around.

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:45.760
And we're excited to
show you those apps.

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.550
For example, they run on the
smart display right here.

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:53.140
And they soon will be
running on phones and TVs.

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:55.690
And we try to make
it easy for you.

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:59.350
Rest assured all those awesome
Google actions that you've

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:03.116
already built can get upgraded
with ease, with technologies

00:03:03.116 --> 00:03:04.240
you're very familiar with--

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:09.140
HTML5-- to make that happen.

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:14.230
So I'm sure many of you are like
us, where when you were a kid,

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:15.910
you wanted a talking robot.

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:18.370
I always wanted Optimus Prime.

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.530
And now, we have it.

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:22.930
It's called the
Google Assistant.

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:27.100
And that is quite an
opportunity for us.

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:29.890
This is one of my
favorite charts.

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:32.950
Each curve here is
the adoption curve

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:35.540
of new technologies over time.

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:38.380
And as you can see,
each one gets sharper

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:41.590
and has higher
adoption rates as we

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:43.870
get closer to where we are now.

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:45.040
And then, you look at us--

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:46.120
smart speakers.

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.460
Now while it's small
right now, that curve

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:50.920
is the sharpest of them all.

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:52.710
People are running
to these devices

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:57.070
and adding it to their
homes around the world.

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:59.650
Now, you probably think
of the Google Assistant

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:02.320
as primarily coming through
these-- the Google Homes

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:04.570
and tons made by third parties.

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:07.460
And that's definitely
the way to think of us.

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:09.970
But we want you to think
of it as more than just

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:11.030
those devices.

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:12.860
This Assistant is everywhere.

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:15.120
It's in your kitchen on
those smart displays.

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:18.040
It's in the living room on TVs.

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:19.930
And most importantly,
it's on the go.

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:22.750
It's in millions and
millions of people's pockets

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:24.840
on their phones.

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:26.710
And we think that's
an opportunity

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:31.930
to reach users in a variety of
modes, in a variety of places.

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:34.750
And we believe it's
a new type of play.

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:36.880
We call it conversational play.

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:39.670
And while we feel like we're
in the black and white film era

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:43.660
of this-- like we're still
learning how to go build these

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:45.370
games--

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:48.010
we do know a couple things.

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:50.290
When we look at
who our users are,

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:53.230
we're seeing a couple of
patterns of who they are.

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:57.550
They're millennials, they're
families, and they're kids--

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:58.570
perfect game players.

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:03.970
We also want to highlight this.

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:08.320
This is "Angry
Birds'" rise to fame.

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:11.410
And what's important to
note is it took a while

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:15.310
before "Angry Birds" became
one of the seminal games

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:17.170
on touchscreens.

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:18.750
Smartphones were released.

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:21.040
And it took about two
years before "Angry Birds"

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:25.082
even came out and rise.

00:05:25.082 --> 00:05:26.540
And this is where
we are right now.

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:29.955
Smart speakers have
been out for a while,

00:05:29.955 --> 00:05:31.580
but there's an
inflection point that we

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:35.040
believe is going to happen,
particularly around play.

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:36.730
And we're down there.

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:39.870
And we believe that one
of you, many of you,

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:44.130
hopefully all of you will
be on that curve coming up.

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:48.180
So I'm going to hand this
off to Andy, who will talk

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:50.408
about building blocks of play.

00:05:50.408 --> 00:05:52.244
[APPLAUSE]

00:05:54.164 --> 00:05:55.080
ANDY PRATT: All right.

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:56.140
Thank you, Thushan.

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:56.940
So I'm Andy.

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:00.410
And I am also officially fun.

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:02.670
And what I would like
to do is talk to you

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:06.280
about the building blocks of
great conversational gameplay.

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:08.580
So there's going to be
unique challenges that

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:10.680
make designing
conversational games very

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:13.800
different than your console,
PC, or mobile games.

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:16.410
And so here are some
of the principles

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:20.580
that our team uses to deliver
engaging experiences that users

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:22.490
love.

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:25.550
First, we need to
create the universe.

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:27.740
Think of some of
your favorite games.

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:30.830
What are the worlds that
they transport you to?

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:32.540
Some of my old
school favorites are

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:36.320
things like "Dark Castle," and
"Space Quest," and "Zelda."

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:38.660
And there's this
orchestration of elements

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:41.570
through the backgrounds,
the characters, the story,

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:42.950
the sounds.

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:44.900
They all work together.

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:50.720
But they often rely on visuals
to bring this world to life.

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:52.390
Now with conversational
games, we

00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:55.420
don't always have those
elements to work with.

00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:57.880
So we need to look for
inspiration elsewhere.

00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:00.130
And one of the places
that we can look

00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:02.950
is the oral
storytelling techniques

00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:05.050
that go back hundreds of years.

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:08.810
So a simple story-starting
phrase like "once upon a time"

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:12.550
helps set the stage in fairy
tales, fables, and myths.

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:16.030
And the origins date
back past the 1400s.

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:18.430
They're also pretty
much universal.

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:21.040
You can find equivalents
in dozens of languages--

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:26.720
so things like "a long time
ago" or "there once lived."

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:29.030
So for us to create
our universe,

00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:32.510
we need to set the stage
just like "once upon a time"

00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:34.460
does for fairy tales.

00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:36.140
It doesn't need
to be much, but it

00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:39.870
does help users understand
the world they are in.

00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:41.760
So here's a quick example.

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:44.700
If you asked the Assistant
what should I be for Halloween,

00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:47.150
it's going to go through
a series of questions

00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:50.360
and help you decide a silly
costume that you should wear

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:52.130
when you go trick or treating.

00:07:52.130 --> 00:07:54.620
So here are two
approaches on how we can

00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:56.330
bring the player into the game.

00:07:56.330 --> 00:07:59.107
Let's listen to the first one.

00:07:59.107 --> 00:08:01.440
GOOGLE ASSISTANT: Welcome to
the Halloween costume quiz.

00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:03.240
Answer these five
questions to find out

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:06.284
what you should be for
Halloween this year.

00:08:06.284 --> 00:08:07.200
ANDY PRATT: All right.

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:09.420
So that technically
does the job.

00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:11.850
It brings the user
in a little bit.

00:08:11.850 --> 00:08:14.820
It also at least gives feedback
to let users know that they've

00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:16.140
entered the right game.

00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:17.650
But I think we can do more.

00:08:17.650 --> 00:08:20.890
So now let's listen
to this second option.

00:08:20.890 --> 00:08:23.170
GOOGLE ASSISTANT: Wow,
I'm so glad you asked.

00:08:23.170 --> 00:08:24.800
I don't want to
toot my own horn,

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:26.241
but I'm kind of an expert.

00:08:26.241 --> 00:08:26.740
[DOORBELL]

00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:28.090
Oh, hold on.

00:08:28.090 --> 00:08:28.990
[GROAN]

00:08:28.990 --> 00:08:30.160
CHILDREN: Trick or treat!

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:31.690
GOOGLE ASSISTANT: Nice costumes.

00:08:31.690 --> 00:08:33.390
Great use of burlap.

00:08:33.390 --> 00:08:33.909
Here you go.

00:08:33.909 --> 00:08:34.570
CHILDREN: Thank you.

00:08:34.570 --> 00:08:36.104
GOOGLE ASSISTANT: OK,
run along and have fun.

00:08:36.104 --> 00:08:36.409
CHILDREN: Thank you.

00:08:36.409 --> 00:08:38.284
GOOGLE ASSISTANT: I need
to help someone now.

00:08:38.284 --> 00:08:39.594
CHILDREN: Bye.

00:08:39.594 --> 00:08:42.010
GOOGLE ASSISTANT: OK, let me
assess your costume interests

00:08:42.010 --> 00:08:43.460
with a few questions.

00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:44.950
Are you ready?

00:08:44.950 --> 00:08:47.500
ANDY PRATT: So listen to how
that second version really

00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:49.180
starts to set the stage.

00:08:49.180 --> 00:08:50.920
And more importantly,
it gets users

00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:52.550
excited about playing the game.

00:08:57.180 --> 00:08:59.660
So the other thing that
we really need to do

00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:03.380
is to kind of look on ways
to layer in sound design.

00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:05.720
It's such a critical element,
especially since we have

00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:08.040
fewer elements to work with.

00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:11.810
So we want to look at ways to
kind of paint this audio world.

00:09:11.810 --> 00:09:13.720
Now this can be done
in a couple of ways.

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:15.680
One is kind of through
the background,

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:18.710
so music or atmosphere
to kind of really

00:09:18.710 --> 00:09:21.110
help create that whole effect.

00:09:21.110 --> 00:09:23.430
Or we can also use it
as a foreground element.

00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:25.100
So maybe we want
to use it as a way

00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:27.020
to give feedback to
the user that they've

00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:28.610
done something right or wrong.

00:09:28.610 --> 00:09:31.220
Or we want to use it to
emphasize key moments

00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:34.010
of delights or dialogue.

00:09:34.010 --> 00:09:37.100
To illustrate this point,
the Google Assistant

00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:39.020

00:10:30.550 --> 00:10:31.870
It's right here.

00:10:31.870 --> 00:10:33.030
It's deep inside.

00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:35.920
It really just helps
elevate everything.

00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:39.730
And so fortunately, later
on in our wonderful program,

00:10:39.730 --> 00:10:41.590
we are going to
show you how to add

00:10:41.590 --> 00:10:43.290
the love into your dialogue.

00:10:46.270 --> 00:10:48.200
Now, another thing
to consider is

00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:51.500
how to use sound to
get users to focus.

00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:54.870
This can be especially helpful
in multiplayer experiences.

00:10:54.870 --> 00:10:57.140
So in our game, "Are
you feeling lucky,"

00:10:57.140 --> 00:10:59.210
users are automatically
given names.

00:10:59.210 --> 00:11:01.880
And since you can have up
to six players at a time,

00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:04.430
we found through our research
that users might forget

00:11:04.430 --> 00:11:06.140
when it's their turn to answer.

00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:11.780
So to help get users to focus,
we pair them with audio cues.

00:11:11.780 --> 00:11:13.250
So let's listen
to how that works.

00:11:18.114 --> 00:11:20.280

so everybody is straight,

[WATER DRIP]

00:11:29.079 --> 00:11:30.870
ANDY PRATT: So this
can be a great way just

00:11:30.870 --> 00:11:34.380
to kind of associate that
audio cue with that name,

00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:35.400
bring users back.

00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:36.450
And it's something
that you guys might

00:11:36.450 --> 00:11:38.640
want to consider as you're
developing games too.

00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:41.190
How can you use audio cues
to get users to focus?

00:11:43.910 --> 00:11:47.180
Now, our next principle
is to keep it simple.

00:11:50.380 --> 00:11:53.020
Conversations-- they're
inherently linear.

00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:54.860
And it's really easy
to move forwards,

00:11:54.860 --> 00:11:57.110
but it's much
harder to move back.

00:11:57.110 --> 00:12:00.110
We can't ask users to hold
too much in their heads.

00:12:00.110 --> 00:12:05.370
So here are a few ways that
you can keep things simple.

00:12:05.370 --> 00:12:08.990
The first is use a
consistent structure.

00:12:08.990 --> 00:12:12.860
Familiarity is going to make
people feel more comfortable.

00:12:12.860 --> 00:12:15.080
And the more we have
deviations, it's

00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:17.960
going to increase the
cognitive load of that player

00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:23.500
and risk to a higher level of
confusion and possibly errors.

00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:26.260
So imagine this--
we're in a quiz.

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:29.410
And here are just two
different questions,

00:12:29.410 --> 00:12:31.368
pretty similar in structure.

00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:38.340
Now, we restate that question.

00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:40.620
And then, we follow
up with the options.

00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:43.630
So we still kind of can vary
the language a little bit,

00:12:43.630 --> 00:12:46.344
but you can see the
structure is very consistent.

00:12:46.344 --> 00:12:48.260
And as the player goes
through the experience,

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:50.370
they're now going to
know what to expect,

00:12:50.370 --> 00:12:53.340
allowing them to focus on
the content and not the game

00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:54.510
mechanics.

00:12:54.510 --> 00:12:58.530
Now, as we push the boundaries
of conversational gameplay,

00:12:58.530 --> 00:13:00.150
you may want to
change the structure.

00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:02.160
So maybe you want to
have like a bonus round

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:03.930
or something like that.

00:13:03.930 --> 00:13:06.750
That's going to be OK as
long as you take the time

00:13:06.750 --> 00:13:09.600
and teach the users that
this portion of the game

00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:10.840
is going to be different.

00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:13.410
So you're going to need to
ultimately weigh is that worth

00:13:13.410 --> 00:13:13.910
it.

00:13:13.910 --> 00:13:17.367
Is it worth it to take that
time in order to explain it,

00:13:17.367 --> 00:13:19.200
even though it may slow
the pace down a bit?

00:13:21.790 --> 00:13:24.040
Now, another simple
thing to keep in mind

00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:26.860
is when you list out the
choices for a player,

00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:30.252
just make sure you follow
up with the exact order.

00:13:30.252 --> 00:13:31.210
So if we look at this--

00:13:31.210 --> 00:13:34.330
would you rather
travel on a tiny plane

00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:37.851
or a surfboard-- we follow up
with plane and then surfboard.

00:13:37.851 --> 00:13:39.850
Sometimes it's easy just
to kind of switch those

00:13:39.850 --> 00:13:41.711
around, but keep it consistent.

00:13:44.420 --> 00:13:47.420
Our next principle is
to keep players engaged.

00:13:47.420 --> 00:13:51.390
We don't want your games
to feel like a lecture.

00:13:51.390 --> 00:13:56.910
It's very easy for players to
lose focus and get distracted.

00:13:56.910 --> 00:13:58.950
One way to do this
is by analyzing

00:13:58.950 --> 00:14:01.870
the player's experience
over the course of the game.

00:14:01.870 --> 00:14:03.930
So some of you kind of
coming from the game world

00:14:03.930 --> 00:14:06.630
may be familiar with the
player interest curve, which

00:14:06.630 --> 00:14:10.350
is essentially a way to
represent the highlights

00:14:10.350 --> 00:14:13.380
and lowlights of a
player's experience.

00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:15.270
And this is going to
be similar to kind

00:14:15.270 --> 00:14:16.567
of creating user journey maps.

00:14:16.567 --> 00:14:18.150
If you're familiar
with product design

00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:21.215
and done some of that, kind
of similar types of concepts.

00:14:21.215 --> 00:14:22.590
You're just simply
going to watch

00:14:22.590 --> 00:14:24.480
players playing your game.

00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:27.030
And you're going to
notice key milestones.

00:14:27.030 --> 00:14:28.290
Watch the reactions.

00:14:28.290 --> 00:14:29.160
Are they cringing?

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:30.140
Are they excited?

00:14:30.140 --> 00:14:32.255
And you're going to
start to plot this.

00:14:32.255 --> 00:14:33.630
Now, as you do
this, you're going

00:14:33.630 --> 00:14:35.580
to generate these patterns.

00:14:35.580 --> 00:14:37.560
And as these patterns
happen, you're

00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:40.410
going to want to make
sure that the curve is up.

00:14:40.410 --> 00:14:41.992
So looking at a
graph like this, this

00:14:41.992 --> 00:14:43.200
is a little bit of a concern.

00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:45.770
You can see it starts
off with a great intro

00:14:45.770 --> 00:14:49.050
and it ends with an outcome, but
the middle kind of sags a bit.

00:14:49.050 --> 00:14:50.460
And we don't want
that to happen.

00:14:53.940 --> 00:14:56.250
One way to keep
players engaged is

00:14:56.250 --> 00:14:59.810
to make the player part
of the conversation.

00:14:59.810 --> 00:15:02.492
Your experience is going to
be directed by the dialogue,

00:15:02.492 --> 00:15:04.200
so we want to make
sure that we're always

00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:07.170
talking with the player
and not at the player.

00:15:07.170 --> 00:15:10.860
You can do this by
creating digestible chunks.

00:15:10.860 --> 00:15:16.480
You find moments for your
player to participate.

00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:19.660
The other thing that we can
do is respond contextually

00:15:19.660 --> 00:15:21.260
whenever possible.

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:24.700
Craft your dialogue based
on that player's response.

00:15:24.700 --> 00:15:26.770
So imagine here,
the player is asked

00:15:26.770 --> 00:15:30.190
if they would rather play
with a unicorn or a dragon.

00:15:30.190 --> 00:15:33.590
And here we have a
very generic response.

00:15:33.590 --> 00:15:37.970
So this could be something
for any of the questions.

00:15:37.970 --> 00:15:41.000
However in this example, we are
able to respond to something

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.250
that's not only a
bit more delightful,

00:15:43.250 --> 00:15:45.750
but it also makes the
game feel smarter.

00:15:45.750 --> 00:15:48.230
It's providing simple
feedback to the user

00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:50.120
that the game understands
what they said.

00:15:53.830 --> 00:15:57.250
Now, as we move to kind of
more visual experiences--

00:15:57.250 --> 00:15:59.740
smart displays-- what
we're going to want to do

00:15:59.740 --> 00:16:05.650
is avoid transcribing word
for word all of the dialogue.

00:16:05.650 --> 00:16:08.360
So Thushan mentioned
before the BuzzFeed quiz,

00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:09.940
and so here is
kind of an example.

00:16:09.940 --> 00:16:12.330
On the right here, we
see this is the TTS.

00:16:12.330 --> 00:16:15.640
So this is what
the output will be.

00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:18.530
On the left is more of
the experience itself.

00:16:18.530 --> 00:16:21.400
So you can see we're not
just using the screen just

00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:22.930
to throw all that text in.

00:16:22.930 --> 00:16:24.160
We want to simplify it.

00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:25.690
We want to move
the user forward.

00:16:25.690 --> 00:16:28.780
We want to use the screen
to create that universe.

00:16:28.780 --> 00:16:31.390
We also want to just make
sure there's opportunities

00:16:31.390 --> 00:16:34.660
to increase the brand and create
more of an emotional connection

00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:35.750
with the user.

00:16:35.750 --> 00:16:38.340
So don't transcribe
your text word for word.

00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:43.340
Another way to keep
players engaged

00:16:43.340 --> 00:16:46.340
is to have a great payoff.

00:16:46.340 --> 00:16:48.800
Our users' time is very
valuable and there's

00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:50.780
a lot of competition
for it, so we

00:16:50.780 --> 00:16:54.177
need to make sure that we reward
them for getting to the end.

00:16:54.177 --> 00:16:55.760
So if you remember
that interest curve

00:16:55.760 --> 00:16:58.610
that I was showing you before,
it ended on that high note.

00:16:58.610 --> 00:17:00.490
You guys, as game
designers, are going

00:17:00.490 --> 00:17:03.440
to need to figure out what
that payoff is going to be.

00:17:06.599 --> 00:17:11.240
All right, our last principle
is to always be playtesting.

00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:14.099
Now in the game industry,
this is nothing new.

00:17:14.099 --> 00:17:16.250
We know that it's going
to help increase quality.

00:17:16.250 --> 00:17:21.050
We know it's going to help find
bugs and basic design flaws.

00:17:21.050 --> 00:17:23.720
We also know that engagement
is going to drop off

00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:25.550
if the game feels broken.

00:17:25.550 --> 00:17:28.109
And we should expect that
errors are going to happen.

00:17:28.109 --> 00:17:29.730
Especially with
conversational games,

00:17:29.730 --> 00:17:32.960
we know that players can
respond with anything.

00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:34.820
The environment may be
polluted-- just kind

00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:36.247
of full of background noise.

00:17:36.247 --> 00:17:38.330
We definitely got a bit
of that as we were kind of

00:17:38.330 --> 00:17:41.260
in the sandbox, and you can kind
of hear all the people around.

00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:43.010
There's going to be
situations like that--

00:17:43.010 --> 00:17:44.150
if you're at a party--

00:17:44.150 --> 00:17:45.170
where it might be tough.

00:17:45.170 --> 00:17:47.300
So we have to
anticipate some of that.

00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:51.260
We also know that players
may forget what to do next.

00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:53.120
A few common errors
that we see are

00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:55.100
going to be things
like no input errors,

00:17:55.100 --> 00:17:58.530
where the Assistant just hasn't
detected a response at all.

00:17:58.530 --> 00:18:00.440
We also see things
like no match errors,

00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:03.740
where maybe the Assistant
can't understand the reply.

00:18:03.740 --> 00:18:06.080
And we also get
false accept errors,

00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:08.840
so this might be where the
Assistant misunderstands

00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:11.810
the user, but just kind
of moves along anyway.

00:18:11.810 --> 00:18:14.960
So here's a few things that we
can do to minimize those errors

00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:18.130
and maximize the fun.

00:18:18.130 --> 00:18:20.950
One, start with your concept.

00:18:20.950 --> 00:18:23.380
And you can do this
in a very low-fi way.

00:18:23.380 --> 00:18:28.810
So have a users, players, read
a script of the happy path,

00:18:28.810 --> 00:18:32.080
or essentially the ideal
path of the game play.

00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:35.020
You need to make sure that
the gameplay is actually fun.

00:18:35.020 --> 00:18:37.000
If the happy path
isn't happy, then it

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:39.550
might be time to look at
ways to iterate on it.

00:18:42.530 --> 00:18:46.210
Another thing we do is we like
to test with our eyes closed.

00:18:46.210 --> 00:18:48.970
So these are
conversational games.

00:18:48.970 --> 00:18:51.850
And you start by
designing with voice only.

00:18:51.850 --> 00:18:53.880
You can do this with
a working prototype,

00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:56.410
so something like dialogue
flow, or you can also

00:18:56.410 --> 00:18:58.660
do this as like a
"Wizard of Oz" technique

00:18:58.660 --> 00:19:00.310
where a team member
maybe simulate

00:19:00.310 --> 00:19:02.200
the response of the
system, and you kind of

00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:04.810
have it set up in this
controlled environment.

00:19:04.810 --> 00:19:09.340
This is a great way to help
test the content, the pacing,

00:19:09.340 --> 00:19:11.440
and the complexity of
your game mechanics.

00:19:14.050 --> 00:19:18.670
Now, the last suggestion
here is to test

00:19:18.670 --> 00:19:22.360
with a range of audiences, not
just your primary demographic.

00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:24.430
So watch your
parents play with it.

00:19:24.430 --> 00:19:26.020
Watch your kids play with it.

00:19:26.020 --> 00:19:29.470
They may bubble up issues with
comprehension and complexity

00:19:29.470 --> 00:19:30.670
of your dialogue.

00:19:30.670 --> 00:19:36.120
They may discover that some
words are just hard to say.

00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:39.750
So to wrap up really quick, some
of the basic building blocks

00:19:39.750 --> 00:19:44.490
that our team uses are create
the universe, keep it simple,

00:19:44.490 --> 00:19:48.670
keep users engaged, and
constantly playtest.

00:19:48.670 --> 00:19:52.760
Now, I'm going to
hand it over to Ralfi.

00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:54.760
[APPLAUSE]

00:19:56.609 --> 00:19:57.900
RALFI NAHMIAS: Hello, everyone.

00:19:57.900 --> 00:20:02.210
This is Ralfi, who is also
fun, from Dialogflow team.

00:20:02.210 --> 00:20:04.490
Now that you are equipped
with the expert tips

00:20:04.490 --> 00:20:06.860
from Andy, let's dive
into how we can actually

00:20:06.860 --> 00:20:09.010
implement all of this.

00:20:09.010 --> 00:20:11.444
The good news is starting
is really simple.

00:20:11.444 --> 00:20:13.110
We are working really
hard on developing

00:20:13.110 --> 00:20:15.840
tools and capabilities to make
it easier for you to focus

00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:17.250
on what you do the best--

00:20:17.250 --> 00:20:19.990
developing games.

00:20:19.990 --> 00:20:22.420
At the high level,
developing actions for Google

00:20:22.420 --> 00:20:23.740
has three main components.

00:20:23.740 --> 00:20:27.010
This applies to any kind of
actions-- games or non-games.

00:20:27.010 --> 00:20:28.480
The first step is
you need to build

00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:30.210
your conversational flows.

00:20:30.210 --> 00:20:33.310
Then, you need to connect
your conversational flow

00:20:33.310 --> 00:20:34.720
to your game logic.

00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:36.880
And lastly, you need
to publish your actions

00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:38.700
to Google Assistant.

00:20:38.700 --> 00:20:40.300
For the rest of this
talk, I am going

00:20:40.300 --> 00:20:44.050
to focus on Dialogflow, our
industry-leading conversational

00:20:44.050 --> 00:20:46.540
agent platform-- creation
platform-- and actions

00:20:46.540 --> 00:20:49.120
on Google Console, which
is the tool that you

00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:53.960
publish your actions
to Google Assistant.

00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:55.960
Dialogflow is a
tool that makes it

00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:58.720
super easy to build
conversational flows.

00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:01.000
It extracts meaning
from dialogues,

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.190
applying machine learning
to the training examples

00:21:03.190 --> 00:21:04.369
that you provide.

00:21:04.369 --> 00:21:05.660
Let me show you how this works.

00:21:08.290 --> 00:21:11.050
Imagine you said the following
sentence-- "send three

00:21:11.050 --> 00:21:13.120
dragons to England immediately!

00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:15.360
Attack with green
flames for five hours."

00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:22.070
Dialogflow understands that
this is about game term.

00:21:22.070 --> 00:21:24.220
It's not about user
asking for help

00:21:24.220 --> 00:21:26.920
or trying to exit the
game, it's about game term.

00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:29.380
It also identifies
important concepts

00:21:29.380 --> 00:21:31.870
within this piece of dialogue.

00:21:31.870 --> 00:21:34.030
It understands common
concepts like numbers,

00:21:34.030 --> 00:21:35.860
countries, colors.

00:21:35.860 --> 00:21:39.910
It can also extract specific
concepts about your game,

00:21:39.910 --> 00:21:42.730
like characters and weapons.

00:21:42.730 --> 00:21:45.760
It's smart enough to understand
some more complex concepts

00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:47.560
like time, which is relative.

00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:49.690
In this example, when
you say five hours,

00:21:49.690 --> 00:21:52.540
it resolves it from the
time that the sentence

00:21:52.540 --> 00:21:54.310
was uttered to 5 hours later.

00:21:56.890 --> 00:21:58.390
And the cool thing
about Dialogflow

00:21:58.390 --> 00:22:01.420
is it comes with built-in
internationalization support.

00:22:01.420 --> 00:22:03.460
With just a few clicks,
you can replicate

00:22:03.460 --> 00:22:06.519
the same conversational
flow in another language.

00:22:06.519 --> 00:22:08.310
If you want to learn
more about Dialogflow,

00:22:08.310 --> 00:22:10.510
you can attend a
dedicated session on it

00:22:10.510 --> 00:22:11.890
at 3:30 on stage two.

00:22:14.590 --> 00:22:17.710
Now that you've built your
actions, it's time to test.

00:22:17.710 --> 00:22:19.720
Up until now, you could
only test your actions

00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:22.570
using your own developer
account on devices

00:22:22.570 --> 00:22:25.640
that are associated with that
particular developer account.

00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:28.420
We've just released
a new feature

00:22:28.420 --> 00:22:31.590
that allows you to share your
actions with a set of alpha

00:22:31.590 --> 00:22:34.300
or beta users.

00:22:34.300 --> 00:22:36.640
The alpha release is really
good for testing in design

00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:37.900
and development phase.

00:22:37.900 --> 00:22:39.820
There are no policy reviews.

00:22:39.820 --> 00:22:42.310
And that's the quickest
way to get your testers,

00:22:42.310 --> 00:22:45.520
and get feedback, and iterate.

00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:48.340
The beta release is for games
that are ready to launch.

00:22:48.340 --> 00:22:50.530
It goes through
full review process.

00:22:50.530 --> 00:22:53.440
The goal here is to find
edge cases, bugs, and issues

00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:54.670
with final polish.

00:22:54.670 --> 00:22:57.870
Ultimately, we want you to
produce the best game possible.

00:23:00.690 --> 00:23:03.680
After you build,
test, and publish,

00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:06.840
you are effectively part
of the Google ecosystem,

00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:09.060
so you should make
the most out of that.

00:23:09.060 --> 00:23:11.790
The easiest way to do
that is account linking.

00:23:11.790 --> 00:23:15.510
It allows your users to use
their own Google accounts

00:23:15.510 --> 00:23:18.660
to play your games or they
can link their Google account

00:23:18.660 --> 00:23:22.410
to your account
management system.

00:23:22.410 --> 00:23:24.360
To set up account
linking, simply

00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:27.920
just go to the Account Linking
view on Actions console.

00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:29.760
There, you can define
what permissions

00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:31.710
you plan to ask from the user.

00:23:31.710 --> 00:23:34.470
These permissions are
defined as scopes.

00:23:34.470 --> 00:23:37.530
For example, you can ask for
access to user's contacts,

00:23:37.530 --> 00:23:39.592
calendar, photos,
or other Google

00:23:39.592 --> 00:23:40.800
services they might be using.

00:23:43.340 --> 00:23:45.020
From a user's
perspective, they'll

00:23:45.020 --> 00:23:47.510
go through this familiar
Google sign-in flow

00:23:47.510 --> 00:23:49.991
to use their own Google account
or link the Google account

00:23:49.991 --> 00:23:50.990
to their gaming account.

00:23:54.610 --> 00:23:58.495
Creating this experience as
a developer is fairly simple.

00:23:58.495 --> 00:24:01.000
You just write literally
two lines of code

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:06.430
and use our sign-in helper
function to request sign-in.

00:24:06.430 --> 00:24:09.410
Once you do that, you need
to handle user's response.

00:24:09.410 --> 00:24:11.410
If the user goes through
the authentication flow

00:24:11.410 --> 00:24:13.840
successfully, you'll
receive an access token,

00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:15.940
which you can use to access
the resources that you

00:24:15.940 --> 00:24:17.800
ask permission for.

00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:19.210
If something goes
wrong, you just

00:24:19.210 --> 00:24:22.470
need to acknowledge it
and gracefully exit.

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.400
One of the key differentiator
of Google Assistant

00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:31.070
is the fact that it's
available in various modalities

00:24:31.070 --> 00:24:33.680
and enables different
interaction types.

00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:36.170
Actions on Google APIs
give you full control

00:24:36.170 --> 00:24:40.244
on how to manage these
different interaction types.

00:24:40.244 --> 00:24:41.660
Let me quickly go
over what I mean

00:24:41.660 --> 00:24:43.930
by these different
interaction types.

00:24:43.930 --> 00:24:46.460
The first one is what
we call voice only.

00:24:46.460 --> 00:24:48.980
You can think of
your smart speakers.

00:24:48.980 --> 00:24:52.410
The whole interaction is
voice-based-- input and output.

00:24:52.410 --> 00:24:54.812
The next interaction type
is called voice forward.

00:24:54.812 --> 00:24:56.270
These are the smart
speakers you've

00:24:56.270 --> 00:24:58.790
seen in the sandbox area.

00:24:58.790 --> 00:25:02.300
Here, again, the primary
mode of interaction is voice,

00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:06.980
but it's enhanced with
visuals when necessary.

00:25:06.980 --> 00:25:09.490
The third interaction
model is intermodal.

00:25:09.490 --> 00:25:11.170
You can think of your phone.

00:25:11.170 --> 00:25:14.612
Here, you have conversation
and visuals intermixed.

00:25:14.612 --> 00:25:16.070
It can start with
the conversation,

00:25:16.070 --> 00:25:19.920
switch to a visual,
and go back and forth.

00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:21.850
And the last one is visual only.

00:25:21.850 --> 00:25:25.590
You can think of your phone
on mute as an example.

00:25:25.590 --> 00:25:28.820
Here, there is no
audio input or output.

00:25:28.820 --> 00:25:32.740
It's all about visuals and text.

00:25:32.740 --> 00:25:35.230
So let's go through an example.

00:25:35.230 --> 00:25:39.240
Let's say that a user is playing
your game on a smart speaker.

00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:43.020
And then, you want to
show them the image

00:25:43.020 --> 00:25:45.990
of their new monster evolved.

00:25:45.990 --> 00:25:48.810
We defined the image here.

00:25:48.810 --> 00:25:50.490
The first thing we
need to do is we

00:25:50.490 --> 00:25:55.380
need to check if the device the
player is playing your game on

00:25:55.380 --> 00:25:57.780
has the capability
to show an image.

00:25:57.780 --> 00:26:01.860
This capability is
defined as screen output.

00:26:01.860 --> 00:26:04.540
If the device has this
capability, great.

00:26:04.540 --> 00:26:05.790
We just show the image.

00:26:05.790 --> 00:26:07.860
But in our example,
the player is

00:26:07.860 --> 00:26:09.420
playing on a smart
speaker, which

00:26:09.420 --> 00:26:11.590
doesn't have that capability.

00:26:11.590 --> 00:26:15.690
So what we do is we ask the
user to switch to a device that

00:26:15.690 --> 00:26:17.500
has this capability.

00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:21.200
We do that with a helper
function called NewSurface.

00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:24.060
We define what capability
we are looking for,

00:26:24.060 --> 00:26:25.800
in this case screen output.

00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:28.220
We give the context to the
user on the smart speaker

00:26:28.220 --> 00:26:29.490
they are interacting with.

00:26:29.490 --> 00:26:33.814
To see your evolved
monster, go to your phone.

00:26:33.814 --> 00:26:35.730
And then, we send a
notification to the device

00:26:35.730 --> 00:26:38.820
that we want to get the user to.

00:26:38.820 --> 00:26:41.649
In this example, we say see
how your monster has evolved.

00:26:41.649 --> 00:26:43.440
And then, they can tap
to this notification

00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:45.356
and continue their
interaction on their phone.

00:26:48.060 --> 00:26:50.550
The final step as a
developer to manage this flow

00:26:50.550 --> 00:26:55.680
is you need to handle
the response of the user

00:26:55.680 --> 00:26:57.570
for our new surface prompt.

00:26:57.570 --> 00:26:59.550
If the user accepts
the prompt, moves

00:26:59.550 --> 00:27:03.810
to this new capable device,
then you simply show the image.

00:27:03.810 --> 00:27:07.660
If they don't, you just need to
gracefully exit and acknowledge

00:27:07.660 --> 00:27:09.715
that you won't be able
to show the image.

00:27:12.900 --> 00:27:16.120
Once your game action
starts getting traction,

00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:18.012
you need to think
about reengagement.

00:27:18.012 --> 00:27:19.720
And we have multiple
ways in our platform

00:27:19.720 --> 00:27:24.920
to help you reengage
with your users.

00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:27.490
We literally have a section
called user engagement

00:27:27.490 --> 00:27:29.610
on our Actions console.

00:27:29.610 --> 00:27:32.590
There, you can opt into push
notifications, routines,

00:27:32.590 --> 00:27:35.080
and daily update suggestions.

00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:37.480
If you opt into
push notifications,

00:27:37.480 --> 00:27:42.040
you will be allowed to send
notifications to your users.

00:27:42.040 --> 00:27:44.980
Obviously, the users
needs to provide consent.

00:27:44.980 --> 00:27:47.080
This is a really
powerful tool, so

00:27:47.080 --> 00:27:51.010
it needs to be used
thoughtfully and sparingly.

00:27:51.010 --> 00:27:54.170
You can think of routines
as actions chained together.

00:27:54.170 --> 00:27:56.980
For example, we have something
like I'm home routine,

00:27:56.980 --> 00:28:00.400
where you can bundle a bunch
of apps you want to trigger.

00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:03.280
And if you say, hey,
Google, I'm home,

00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:05.780
you might have Google
turn on the lights,

00:28:05.780 --> 00:28:08.140
adjust the thermostat,
tell you a joke maybe,

00:28:08.140 --> 00:28:11.370
and start your
favorite playlist.

00:28:11.370 --> 00:28:13.540
Daily updates is also similar.

00:28:13.540 --> 00:28:17.850
You set up a daily
notification that reoccurs

00:28:17.850 --> 00:28:20.320
every day at a set time.

00:28:20.320 --> 00:28:23.900
The user experience for
daily updates and routines

00:28:23.900 --> 00:28:27.940
is after your users engage
with your app and exit,

00:28:27.940 --> 00:28:29.710
they'll see a
suggestion shipped,

00:28:29.710 --> 00:28:33.130
prompting them to add your
action to daily updates

00:28:33.130 --> 00:28:35.560
or routines.

00:28:35.560 --> 00:28:38.800
Routines may not be that
suitable for gaming vertical,

00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:40.179
but something you think about.

00:28:40.179 --> 00:28:42.220
I'm just going to focus
on daily updates for now.

00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:50.990
This is what your users will see
if you opt into daily updates.

00:28:50.990 --> 00:28:53.890
After the user ends
their interaction,

00:28:53.890 --> 00:28:56.930
there will be a chip which
says, do you want me to send--

00:28:56.930 --> 00:28:58.980
in this case-- jokes daily?

00:28:58.980 --> 00:29:02.737
And if the user opts in,
Google will guide the user

00:29:02.737 --> 00:29:04.820
through setting the time
of the day when they want

00:29:04.820 --> 00:29:06.830
to receive the daily update.

00:29:06.830 --> 00:29:08.310
From this point
on, as a developer,

00:29:08.310 --> 00:29:09.393
you need to do two things.

00:29:11.900 --> 00:29:14.940
First, you need to handle user's
response to the daily update

00:29:14.940 --> 00:29:16.180
flow.

00:29:16.180 --> 00:29:18.820
If the user goes through
the flow successfully,

00:29:18.820 --> 00:29:20.410
you need to acknowledge that.

00:29:20.410 --> 00:29:24.610
If not, again, you need
to gracefully exit.

00:29:24.610 --> 00:29:27.520
The second step is you need
to define what you actually

00:29:27.520 --> 00:29:30.160
want to do when the
daily triggers arrives.

00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:35.020
Here, we set to trigger
the update intent.

00:29:35.020 --> 00:29:38.650
In the best dad jokes,
example the update intent

00:29:38.650 --> 00:29:42.325
would just send a new joke.

00:29:42.325 --> 00:29:44.200
Ultimately, this is what
your users will see.

00:29:48.740 --> 00:29:52.430
Lastly, I'd like to
talk about monetization

00:29:52.430 --> 00:29:54.260
options for your game.

00:29:54.260 --> 00:29:57.060
We just announced our
digital goods API here

00:29:57.060 --> 00:30:00.080
at I/O, that allows
you to directly sell

00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:04.150
digital entitlements using
Google Play infrastructure.

00:30:04.150 --> 00:30:07.160
This builds upon our
earlier launch this year,

00:30:07.160 --> 00:30:10.160
where you could use your
existing Play entitlements

00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:11.850
with Assistant actions.

00:30:11.850 --> 00:30:14.690
For example, if you
bought an audiobook

00:30:14.690 --> 00:30:18.620
or purchased a
monster in your game,

00:30:18.620 --> 00:30:21.860
you could actually use it
in your Google Assistant.

00:30:21.860 --> 00:30:25.950
What digital goods API does is
it makes the reverse also true.

00:30:25.950 --> 00:30:28.730
If you have a transaction
in your action,

00:30:28.730 --> 00:30:34.490
the same entitlement can be
used in your Android app.

00:30:34.490 --> 00:30:40.130
Let me go through an example
from our partners in Headspace

00:30:40.130 --> 00:30:42.950
to show you how this could
work on a smart display.

00:30:42.950 --> 00:30:45.600
For those of you who don't
know about Headspace,

00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:48.874
they are a company who build
products on guided meditation.

00:30:51.480 --> 00:30:53.820
So let's say that
a session is over

00:30:53.820 --> 00:30:58.500
and Headspace offers
the option to subscribe.

00:30:58.500 --> 00:31:00.980
The user responds with
an intent to subscribe.

00:31:03.820 --> 00:31:05.570
And the action shows
the available options

00:31:05.570 --> 00:31:09.450
in a very curated
and visual way.

00:31:09.450 --> 00:31:11.455
The user picks an option
and is handed over

00:31:11.455 --> 00:31:12.330
to the checkout flow.

00:31:15.330 --> 00:31:17.520
Here, if you enabled
account linking

00:31:17.520 --> 00:31:20.920
and the user already has account
credentials stored with Google,

00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:24.070
the checkout will
be very seamless.

00:31:24.070 --> 00:31:26.119
You just with a single
tap or a command,

00:31:26.119 --> 00:31:27.660
you'll have your
premium content that

00:31:27.660 --> 00:31:32.520
can be reused on the Assistant,
and also on Android apps.

00:31:32.520 --> 00:31:34.170
With that, I'm going
to hand it back

00:31:34.170 --> 00:31:37.620
to Thushan, who's going to talk
about implementing some best

00:31:37.620 --> 00:31:40.206
practices in your games.

00:31:40.206 --> 00:31:42.134
[APPLAUSE]

00:31:45.030 --> 00:31:47.660
THUSHAN AMARASIRIWARDENA: So
now, we're going to pump it up.

00:31:47.660 --> 00:31:49.740
If you remember back
when Andy was talking,

00:31:49.740 --> 00:31:52.910
we showed the difference of
what sound design can do.

00:31:52.910 --> 00:31:56.930
These devices really rely
on music, sound effects,

00:31:56.930 --> 00:31:58.430
and voice.

00:31:58.430 --> 00:32:01.880
And we have some
technology that we

00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:06.290
wanted to showcase that can
help you pump it up quite a bit.

00:32:06.290 --> 00:32:10.190
You could, for example,
record tons and tons of lines

00:32:10.190 --> 00:32:12.980
with a voice actor and
get a sound engineer

00:32:12.980 --> 00:32:16.190
to add sound effects and
make some beautiful audio.

00:32:16.190 --> 00:32:18.840
Or you could use this
technology called

00:32:18.840 --> 00:32:21.050
SSML, which is Speech
Synthesis Markup

00:32:21.050 --> 00:32:25.712
Language, that allows you to
do it in real time in code.

00:32:25.712 --> 00:32:27.170
And what that also
allows you to do

00:32:27.170 --> 00:32:29.520
is to put variables
along the way.

00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:31.640
Now, we have this
static poem, but imagine

00:32:31.640 --> 00:32:34.940
if it said, thank you
for humoring me, Thushan.

00:32:34.940 --> 00:32:37.460
You could add
personalization to it,

00:32:37.460 --> 00:32:40.040
and yet still have that
dynamic sound effects and all.

00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:42.330
So here's our script.

00:32:42.330 --> 00:32:45.030
And we're going to
start pumping it up.

00:32:45.030 --> 00:32:48.020
SSML is just like HTML,
you just add tags.

00:32:48.020 --> 00:32:50.090
You wrap it in a speak tag.

00:32:50.090 --> 00:32:53.870
You put paragraph tags
when you have each line.

00:32:53.870 --> 00:32:55.370
And then, you can
start doing things

00:32:55.370 --> 00:32:56.900
like adding sound effects.

00:32:56.900 --> 00:33:00.890
And it's a simple audio
URL from your server.

00:33:03.800 --> 00:33:06.410
But there's more than just
text and sound effects.

00:33:06.410 --> 00:33:08.301
There's sound
layering, and that's

00:33:08.301 --> 00:33:09.800
what we're going
to talk about here.

00:33:09.800 --> 00:33:11.870
We have a tag called media.

00:33:11.870 --> 00:33:14.390
What media does is allow
you to essentially, make

00:33:14.390 --> 00:33:17.850
two or multiple tracks, and
then layer them together.

00:33:17.850 --> 00:33:19.730
This is our first track here.

00:33:19.730 --> 00:33:21.530
And we're going to call it poem.

00:33:21.530 --> 00:33:24.349
And it's going to
start one second in.

00:33:24.349 --> 00:33:25.640
And you'll see why in a second.

00:33:25.640 --> 00:33:26.900
We add another sound effect.

00:33:26.900 --> 00:33:30.480
And we even put a
little dramatic pause.

00:33:30.480 --> 00:33:35.280
And then, we work
on our music loop.

00:33:35.280 --> 00:33:36.840
We call it music.

00:33:36.840 --> 00:33:39.660
We can control how many
times it loops through,

00:33:39.660 --> 00:33:44.250
set the sound level, if we
want it to fade in or fade out.

00:33:44.250 --> 00:33:48.720
And then, we use that name from
earlier when the poem ends.

00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:50.490
Let's run it for another second.

00:33:50.490 --> 00:33:53.910
And then, we have our
music loop itself.

00:33:53.910 --> 00:33:57.270
So altogether, we
wrap it in another tag

00:33:57.270 --> 00:33:59.330
called parallel, or par.

00:33:59.330 --> 00:34:02.140
And that runs both of
those tracks together.

00:34:02.140 --> 00:34:04.980
Now, what I showed you here is a
truncated version of that poem,

00:34:04.980 --> 00:34:09.201
but let's hear that example.

00:34:09.201 --> 00:34:10.909
GOOGLE ASSISTANT:
Thanks for humoring me.

00:34:10.909 --> 00:34:12.980

seconds to write it down.

We've go the music.

00:34:19.365 --> 00:34:19.960
We've got that sound effect.

GOOGLE ASSISTANT: Lean on me,
friend, when it's time to make

00:34:22.460 --> 00:34:23.000
plans.

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:24.560
Whether you're
searching for info,

00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:26.960
trying to spell "chateau,"
looking for recipes

00:34:26.960 --> 00:34:29.670
or other necessities, if
you have any questions,

00:34:29.670 --> 00:34:31.908
I'll always reply.

00:34:31.908 --> 00:34:33.699
THUSHAN AMARASIRIWARDENA:
And that fadeout.

00:34:33.699 --> 00:34:34.782
And it's all done in code.

00:34:38.136 --> 00:34:40.010
The other big thing we
want to leave you with

00:34:40.010 --> 00:34:43.580
is if you make something
and no one hears it,

00:34:43.580 --> 00:34:45.090
not only is that a
punch in the gut,

00:34:45.090 --> 00:34:50.100
but you're wondering what you
can do to make that happen.

00:34:50.100 --> 00:34:53.130
So we want to tell
you that very,

00:34:53.130 --> 00:34:56.150
very soon, we're going to
be opening up "hey, Google,

00:34:56.150 --> 00:35:00.230
let's play a game"
to all developers.

00:35:00.230 --> 00:35:02.120
This is called a
built-in intent.

00:35:02.120 --> 00:35:05.750
There are other talks about it,
but register your app for it.

00:35:05.750 --> 00:35:11.000
Consider it the app store of
games on the Google Assistant.

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:13.130
And when someone says
"play a game," which

00:35:13.130 --> 00:35:15.920
is what a lot of
our users are doing,

00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:19.040
they'll get a list of
the games available.

00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:21.860
And this works on both
smart displays, phones,

00:35:21.860 --> 00:35:22.775
and smart speakers.

00:35:25.740 --> 00:35:29.430
But to make that happen, we
have a little homework for you.

00:35:29.430 --> 00:35:31.800
Go back into your actions
on Google console,

00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:33.510
and fill out all the metadata.

00:35:33.510 --> 00:35:37.740
That's what we use
to look at your app,

00:35:37.740 --> 00:35:40.910
know what it is about,
and feature it with users.

00:35:40.910 --> 00:35:42.570
So make sure you
have beautiful icons

00:35:42.570 --> 00:35:44.360
and your descriptions
are great there.

00:35:46.970 --> 00:35:49.370
And I'm going to tell
you a little secret--

00:35:49.370 --> 00:35:51.980
we don't usually talk
about how we rank things,

00:35:51.980 --> 00:35:53.810
but I wanted to highlight this.

00:35:53.810 --> 00:35:57.890
This is how we look for quality.

00:35:57.890 --> 00:36:01.250
Straight up quality,
be it it sounds great,

00:36:01.250 --> 00:36:05.480
the gameplay is great, and users
are loving it and rating it.

00:36:05.480 --> 00:36:09.200
We're looking for long sessions
and games that have people

00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:11.422
coming back for more and more.

00:36:11.422 --> 00:36:13.880
We're looking for games that
map to those core demographics

00:36:13.880 --> 00:36:16.546
of millennials,
families, and kids.

00:36:16.546 --> 00:36:18.170
And we're looking
for games that aren't

00:36:18.170 --> 00:36:19.700
like the others around there.

00:36:19.700 --> 00:36:23.720
We want to offer our users
a wide variety of games.

00:36:23.720 --> 00:36:27.350
And then, if you can update
your apps regularly and feature

00:36:27.350 --> 00:36:30.050
the new tech, like jumping
onto those smart displays,

00:36:30.050 --> 00:36:33.320
that will give you a great shot
of getting in front of users.

00:36:35.880 --> 00:36:40.650
So we want to leave
you with one last note.

00:36:40.650 --> 00:36:43.290
I think many of you have
been on the touchscreen

00:36:43.290 --> 00:36:45.900
revolution of making apps.

00:36:45.900 --> 00:36:48.750
And we think there's an
opportunity very similar

00:36:48.750 --> 00:36:53.020
here with these smart speakers
and digital assistants.

00:36:53.020 --> 00:36:56.265
And on behalf of the Dialogflow,
the ActionsOnGoogle team

00:36:56.265 --> 00:37:00.700
and Assistant, we know that it's
hard, but we're here for you.

00:37:00.700 --> 00:37:02.830
We want to see you succeed.

00:37:02.830 --> 00:37:05.950
And we would love
to hear from you.

00:37:05.950 --> 00:37:07.990
I'm going to show you our
email addresses later,

00:37:07.990 --> 00:37:09.850
but we think there's
an opportunity

00:37:09.850 --> 00:37:13.210
to become the household name
of conversation, and play,

00:37:13.210 --> 00:37:14.440
and games.

00:37:14.440 --> 00:37:16.570
And we want it to be you--

00:37:16.570 --> 00:37:18.310
all of you.

00:37:18.310 --> 00:37:20.050
Thank you so much.

00:37:20.050 --> 00:37:21.730
Please leave us feedback.

00:37:21.730 --> 00:37:23.950
And take a snapshot of
our email addresses.

00:37:23.950 --> 00:37:25.780
We would love to
hear from you, be

00:37:25.780 --> 00:37:29.594
it new or questions
about how to use it,

00:37:29.594 --> 00:37:30.760
and apps that you're making.

00:37:30.760 --> 00:37:31.930
We'd love to play with them.

00:37:31.930 --> 00:37:32.980
Thanks so much.

00:37:32.980 --> 00:37:34.960
And we can't wait
to play your games.

00:37:34.960 --> 00:37:38.178
