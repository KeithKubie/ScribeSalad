person other than that but let's say

person other than that but let's say
 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.109
person other than that but let's say
that and so your reaction is I'm never

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119
that and so your reaction is I'm never
 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.840
that and so your reaction is I'm never
going to be aggressive and so you built

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850

so what happens this burns off and then
 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:31.800
so what happens this burns off and then
that comes back up now you still have to

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810
that comes back up now you still have to

that comes back up now you still have to

integrating their capacity for

integrating their capacity for
aggression because without that capacity

there isn't anything that you can do to

or conversely it means I will play for
higher stakes than you will and unless

higher stakes than you will and unless

higher stakes than you will and unless
you've got your aggression integrated

you've got your aggression integrated
 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:25.709
you've got your aggression integrated
there isn't a chance you can say that

there isn't a chance you can say that
 

00:04:25.719 --> 00:04:26.580
there isn't a chance you can say that
and if you did no one

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:26.590
and if you did no one
 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:28.650
and if you did no one
would take you seriously because they'd

most useful things that Jung did I think

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:34.540
most useful things that Jung did I think
 

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:36.000
most useful things that Jung did I think
was to work on this idea of the

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:36.010
was to work on this idea of the
 

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:37.620
was to work on this idea of the
integration of the shadow because he was

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:37.630
integration of the shadow because he was
 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:39.120
integration of the shadow because he was
really interested in the idea of evil

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:39.130
really interested in the idea of evil
 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:41.580
really interested in the idea of evil
right especially working with trying to

what do you do with the part of you
 

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:49.080

that's aggressive and and potentially

that's aggressive and and potentially
 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:51.060
that's aggressive and and potentially
malevolent do you just crush it that's

is that a possibility or do you admit to

its existence and bring it into the game
and that's see for Freud in some sense

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:05.050
and that's see for Freud in some sense
 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:07.590
and that's see for Freud in some sense
morality was super-ego clamping down on

guys out to play and so you're an
aggressive hockey player but it's

aggressive hockey player but it's
 

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:25.590

disciplined aggression that makes you

then with regards to sexuality it's like

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:31.690
then with regards to sexuality it's like
 

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:33.930
then with regards to sexuality it's like
well untrammeled promiscuity doesn't

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:33.940
well untrammeled promiscuity doesn't
 

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:36.770
well untrammeled promiscuity doesn't
constitute a virtue but neither does

unavoidable virginity right in fact I

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:40.240
unavoidable virginity right in fact I
 

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:42.779
unavoidable virginity right in fact I
think that's worse because it also masks

00:05:42.779 --> 00:05:42.789
think that's worse because it also masks
 

00:05:42.789 --> 00:05:45.330
think that's worse because it also masks
itself with virtue it's like well you

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:45.340
itself with virtue it's like well you
 

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:48.510
itself with virtue it's like well you
should be able to you should be able to

should be able to you should be able to
 

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:51.020
should be able to you should be able to
do things that you wouldn't do that's

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:51.030
do things that you wouldn't do that's
 

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:53.360
do things that you wouldn't do that's
that's like the definition of a

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:53.370
that's like the definition of a
 

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:56.870
that's like the definition of a
genuinely moral person they could do it

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:56.880
genuinely moral person they could do it
 

00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:00.180
genuinely moral person they could do it
but they don't and then that's not

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:00.190
but they don't and then that's not
 

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:03.510
but they don't and then that's not
cowardice and so that's you burn off the

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:03.520
cowardice and so that's you burn off the
 

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:05.129
cowardice and so that's you burn off the
things that get in the way of that

00:06:05.129 --> 00:06:05.139
things that get in the way of that
 

00:06:05.139 --> 00:06:08.279
things that get in the way of that
integration so when you say dissolve and

00:06:08.279 --> 00:06:08.289
integration so when you say dissolve and
 

00:06:08.289 --> 00:06:10.469
integration so when you say dissolve and
integrate it be a good way to sort of

00:06:10.469 --> 00:06:10.479
integrate it be a good way to sort of
 

00:06:10.479 --> 00:06:12.510
integrate it be a good way to sort of
bring the two ideas together that the

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:12.520
bring the two ideas together that the
 

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:14.930
bring the two ideas together that the
burning off and the difficult process is

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:14.940
burning off and the difficult process is
 

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:17.790
burning off and the difficult process is
necessary because the elements of

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:17.800
necessary because the elements of
 

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:19.830
necessary because the elements of
yourself are structured together in a

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:19.840
yourself are structured together in a
 

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:22.080
yourself are structured together in a
rigid way that is not working properly

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:22.090
rigid way that is not working properly
 

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:24.420
rigid way that is not working properly
and that's what happens to Geppetto in

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:24.430
and that's what happens to Geppetto in
 

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:27.029
and that's what happens to Geppetto in
the belly of the whale he's so caught in

00:06:27.029 --> 00:06:27.039
the belly of the whale he's so caught in
 

00:06:27.039 --> 00:06:29.279
the belly of the whale he's so caught in
his presuppositions that he can't escape

00:06:29.279 --> 00:06:29.289
his presuppositions that he can't escape
 

00:06:29.289 --> 00:06:31.770
his presuppositions that he can't escape
right and so Pinocchio represents the

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:31.780
right and so Pinocchio represents the
 

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:33.629
right and so Pinocchio represents the
new force so it's very interesting so

00:06:33.629 --> 00:06:33.639
new force so it's very interesting so
 

00:06:33.639 --> 00:06:35.310
new force so it's very interesting so
when you watch Pinocchio try to rescue

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:35.320
when you watch Pinocchio try to rescue
 

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:35.850
when you watch Pinocchio try to rescue
him

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:35.860
him
 

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:37.770
him
the first thing Geppetto does is confuse

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:37.780
the first thing Geppetto does is confuse
 

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:39.750
the first thing Geppetto does is confuse
Pinocchio with a fish because he wants

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:39.760
Pinocchio with a fish because he wants
 

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:40.470
Pinocchio with a fish because he wants
something to eat

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:40.480
something to eat
 

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:41.940
something to eat
but Pinocchio is better than something

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:41.950
but Pinocchio is better than something
 

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:43.770
but Pinocchio is better than something
to eat because he could rescue him so he

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:43.780
to eat because he could rescue him so he
 

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:45.720
to eat because he could rescue him so he
doesn't need to eat and then Pinocchio

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:45.730
doesn't need to eat and then Pinocchio
 

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:48.300
doesn't need to eat and then Pinocchio
wants to make a fire in Geppetto objects

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:48.310
wants to make a fire in Geppetto objects
 

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:49.470
wants to make a fire in Geppetto objects
because he's gonna burn up all the

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:49.480
because he's gonna burn up all the
 

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:51.630
because he's gonna burn up all the
furniture it's like we don't need the

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:51.640
furniture it's like we don't need the
 

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:53.010
furniture it's like we don't need the
damn furniture if we're getting out of

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:53.020
damn furniture if we're getting out of
 

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:55.530
damn furniture if we're getting out of
the whale you know and so so Geppetto

00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:55.540
the whale you know and so so Geppetto
 

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:57.540
the whale you know and so so Geppetto
and and he's old so that that that's

00:06:57.540 --> 00:06:57.550
and and he's old so that that that's
 

00:06:57.550 --> 00:06:59.490
and and he's old so that that that's
that that's the rigid structure that's

00:06:59.490 --> 00:06:59.500
that that's the rigid structure that's
 

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:01.590
that that's the rigid structure that's
the old year that has to die off before

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:01.600
the old year that has to die off before
 

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:03.930
the old year that has to die off before
the new year can be born it's a forest

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:03.940
the new year can be born it's a forest
 

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:05.940
the new year can be born it's a forest
fire that allows for new growth and and

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:05.950
fire that allows for new growth and and
 

00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:07.530
fire that allows for new growth and and
that's how those things are put together

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:07.540
that's how those things are put together
 

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:09.810
that's how those things are put together
and to see and it's useful to know too

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:09.820
and to see and it's useful to know too
 

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:11.670
and to see and it's useful to know too
because if you burn something off you

00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:11.680
because if you burn something off you
 

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:12.930
because if you burn something off you
might think well there's nothing left

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:12.940
might think well there's nothing left
 

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:15.630
might think well there's nothing left
it's like that's not true if it's dead

00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:15.640
it's like that's not true if it's dead
 

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:17.280
it's like that's not true if it's dead
wood then you have room for new growth

wood then you have room for new growth
 

00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:19.200
wood then you have room for new growth
and you want to be doing that on a

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:19.210
and you want to be doing that on a
 

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:22.440
and you want to be doing that on a
fairly regular basis that's the that's

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:22.450
fairly regular basis that's the that's
 

00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:25.230
fairly regular basis that's the that's
that's the snake that sheds its skin and

00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:25.240
that's the snake that sheds its skin and
 

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:27.390
that's the snake that sheds its skin and
transforms itself right that's that's

00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:27.400
transforms itself right that's that's
 

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:29.700
transforms itself right that's that's
the death and resurrection from a

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:29.710
the death and resurrection from a
 

00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:31.410
the death and resurrection from a
psychological perspective it's exactly

00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:31.420
psychological perspective it's exactly
 

00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:33.210
psychological perspective it's exactly
the same idea now we don't know the

00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:33.220
the same idea now we don't know the
 

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:35.070
the same idea now we don't know the
upper limit to that right because we

00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:35.080
upper limit to that right because we
 

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:36.240
upper limit to that right because we
don't know what a person would be like

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:36.250
don't know what a person would be like
 

00:07:36.250 --> 00:07:38.460
don't know what a person would be like
if they let everything that they could

00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:38.470
if they let everything that they could
 

00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:43.070
if they let everything that they could
let go let go and only let in what was

00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:43.080
let go let go and only let in what was
 

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:46.740
let go let go and only let in what was
seemly let's say but you can see that's

00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:46.750
seemly let's say but you can see that's
 

00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:48.840
seemly let's say but you can see that's
funny we don't know that to some degree

00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:48.850
funny we don't know that to some degree
 

00:07:48.850 --> 00:07:51.930
funny we don't know that to some degree
you can see people very firm you can see

00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:51.940
you can see people very firm you can see
 

00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:55.080
you can see people very firm you can see
people start to do that without that's

00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:55.090
people start to do that without that's
 

00:07:55.090 --> 00:07:59.340
people start to do that without that's
not an rare experience and people

00:07:59.340 --> 00:07:59.350
not an rare experience and people
 

00:07:59.350 --> 00:08:01.560
not an rare experience and people
improve very rapidly they can improve

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:01.570
improve very rapidly they can improve
 

00:08:01.570 --> 00:08:03.180
improve very rapidly they can improve
their lives very rapidly a lot of its

00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:03.190
their lives very rapidly a lot of its
 

00:08:03.190 --> 00:08:05.190
their lives very rapidly a lot of its
low-hanging fruit like if you just stop

00:08:05.190 --> 00:08:05.200
low-hanging fruit like if you just stop
 

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:08.010
low-hanging fruit like if you just stop
doing really stupid things that you know

00:08:08.010 --> 00:08:08.020
doing really stupid things that you know
 

00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:11.040
doing really stupid things that you know
are stupid your life improves a lot so

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:11.050
are stupid your life improves a lot so
 

00:08:11.050 --> 00:08:13.890
are stupid your life improves a lot so
and it frees you up it also means

00:08:13.890 --> 00:08:13.900
and it frees you up it also means
 

00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:15.240
and it frees you up it also means
there's a there's an element there

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:15.250
there's a there's an element there
 

00:08:15.250 --> 00:08:17.660
there's a there's an element there
that's also associated with pride

00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:17.670
that's also associated with pride
 

00:08:17.670 --> 00:08:20.160
that's also associated with pride
because people tend to take pride in who

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:20.170
because people tend to take pride in who
 

00:08:20.170 --> 00:08:21.780
because people tend to take pride in who
they are and that's a bad idea because

00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:21.790
they are and that's a bad idea because
 

00:08:21.790 --> 00:08:25.050
they are and that's a bad idea because
that stops you from becoming who you

00:08:25.050 --> 00:08:25.060
that stops you from becoming who you
 

00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:26.760
that stops you from becoming who you
could be because if you're proud of who

00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:26.770
could be because if you're proud of who
 

00:08:26.770 --> 00:08:29.100
could be because if you're proud of who
you are you won't let that go when it's

00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:29.110
you are you won't let that go when it's
 

00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:31.080
you are you won't let that go when it's
necessary you won't step away from it

00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:31.090
necessary you won't step away from it
 

00:08:31.090 --> 00:08:32.940
necessary you won't step away from it
you know and then you end up being your

00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:32.950
you know and then you end up being your
 

00:08:32.950 --> 00:08:35.790
you know and then you end up being your
own parody something like that that's

00:08:35.790 --> 00:08:35.800
own parody something like that that's
 

00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:37.830
own parody something like that that's
also a very bad idea you want to be

00:08:37.830 --> 00:08:37.840
also a very bad idea you want to be
 

00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:39.839
also a very bad idea you want to be
continually stepping away from your

00:08:39.839 --> 00:08:39.849
continually stepping away from your
 

00:08:39.849 --> 00:08:43.110
continually stepping away from your
previous self and so big and I guess

00:08:43.110 --> 00:08:43.120
previous self and so big and I guess
 

00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:45.150
previous self and so big and I guess
part of that too is that you you have to

00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:45.160
part of that too is that you you have to
 

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:48.240
part of that too is that you you have to
decide you know are you are you order or

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:48.250
decide you know are you are you order or
 

00:08:48.250 --> 00:08:50.100
decide you know are you are you order or
you chaos or you the process that

00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:50.110
you chaos or you the process that
 

00:08:50.110 --> 00:08:51.690
you chaos or you the process that
mediates between them and if you're the

00:08:51.690 --> 00:08:51.700
mediates between them and if you're the
 

00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:53.850
mediates between them and if you're the
process that mediates between them you

00:08:53.850 --> 00:08:53.860
process that mediates between them you
 

00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:56.240
process that mediates between them you
you are the thing that transforms and

00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:56.250
you are the thing that transforms and
 

00:08:56.250 --> 00:08:58.560
you are the thing that transforms and
that's the right attitude for human

00:08:58.560 --> 00:08:58.570
that's the right attitude for human
 

00:08:58.570 --> 00:09:00.930
that's the right attitude for human
being because that's what we are we're

00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:00.940
being because that's what we are we're
 

00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:02.970
being because that's what we are we're
the thing that voluntarily confronts

00:09:02.970 --> 00:09:02.980
the thing that voluntarily confronts
 

00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:06.000
the thing that voluntarily confronts
chaos and transforms that's what we are

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:06.010
chaos and transforms that's what we are
 

00:09:06.010 --> 00:09:09.000
chaos and transforms that's what we are
and so for better or worse you know

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:09.010
and so for better or worse you know
 

00:09:09.010 --> 00:09:12.300
and so for better or worse you know
that's our deepest biological essence

00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:12.310
that's our deepest biological essence
 

00:09:12.310 --> 00:09:14.610
that's our deepest biological essence
you might say and so you can let things

00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:14.620
you might say and so you can let things
 

00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:16.139
you might say and so you can let things
go if you know that there's more growth

00:09:16.139 --> 00:09:16.149
go if you know that there's more growth
 

00:09:16.149 --> 00:09:19.920
go if you know that there's more growth
to come so
