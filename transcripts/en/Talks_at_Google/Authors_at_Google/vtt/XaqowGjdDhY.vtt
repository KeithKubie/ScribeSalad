VERA: OK, so thanks,
everyone, for coming.

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:10.344
My name is Vera.

00:00:10.344 --> 00:00:12.010
Myself and Verne head
up Talks at Google

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:13.310
for the Toronto office.

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:15.639
This is our second installment.

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:17.430
We're sticking on this
charity [INAUDIBLE].

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.420
I love it very much.

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:21.650
So we have Dr. Samantha
Nutt from War Child

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:23.000
here with us today.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.500
Adam Green, as you
all know, who's

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.180
from the agency team
who's the creative lead,

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:29.550
he will be hosting.

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.490
And welcome.

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:32.687
Thank you for coming.

00:00:32.687 --> 00:00:35.020
If you do have any questions,
please walk up to the mics

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:37.019
as there are people on
the live stream and we're

00:00:37.019 --> 00:00:37.960
recording this.

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:38.461
Thank you.

00:00:38.461 --> 00:00:39.293
ADAM GREEN: Awesome.

00:00:39.293 --> 00:00:40.060
Thanks, Vera.

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:41.110
And welcome, Samantha.

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:41.460
SAMANTHA NUTT: Thank you.

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:42.330
Happy to be here.

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:44.710
ADAM GREEN: Thanks for
coming in to Google.

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.105
So for those who aren't
familiar with your work,

00:00:47.105 --> 00:00:48.480
if you could tell
us a little bit

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.850
about what is War
Child and the work

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:53.512
that you guys do
around the world.

00:00:53.512 --> 00:00:55.470
SAMANTHA NUTT: So War
Child is an international

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:57.640
non-governmental
organization and charity.

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.600
And we work with children
and their families

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.490
on the front lines of
most of the world's

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:04.459
most significant and
intense conflicts.

00:01:04.459 --> 00:01:07.220
So essentially what we are
is we're a protection agency.

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:08.684
So we go into
environments to work

00:01:08.684 --> 00:01:10.100
with those kids
and their families

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.500
to make sure that they are safe,
that their needs are being met,

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.260
and that they have opportunities
to rebuild their lives

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.670
and rebuild their communities
over the long term.

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.154
The ways in which we do
that, what we focus on,

00:01:22.154 --> 00:01:23.070
we have three pillars.

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.390
So one is education, making
sure that kids in war

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:28.930
are allowed to maintain
their education,

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:32.740
catch up on their education,
and grow to be thriving members

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:33.714
of their community.

00:01:33.714 --> 00:01:36.130
The second part of what we
do-- it sounds a bit technical,

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:37.120
but it's justice work.

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:40.220
And so we make sure that
especially in environments

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:45.510
where girls and young boys
can be sexually assaulted,

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:47.840
where their rights are
routinely being violated,

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.510
we work to actually promote
and uphold the rule of law

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:53.857
by training lawyers
and paralegals,

00:01:53.857 --> 00:01:55.440
defending the rights
of those children

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.390
actively within
those communities,

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.354
but also through the legal
infrastructure if one exists.

00:02:00.354 --> 00:02:01.770
And then the third
part of what we

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.150
do we call opportunity, which
is really about making sure

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:07.240
that families are
economically self-reliant

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.930
and have the opportunity to
provide for themselves to try

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:12.870
to break that cycle
of aid dependency

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.747
that plagues so many
humanitarian catastrophes

00:02:15.747 --> 00:02:17.330
around the world,
but just making sure

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.804
that those families have
resources at their own disposal

00:02:20.804 --> 00:02:22.970
to be able to make the right
kinds of decisions that

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:25.170
will be suitable for them
and for their children.

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:26.390
ADAM GREEN: That's
fantastic work.

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:27.431
SAMANTHA NUTT: Thank you.

00:02:27.431 --> 00:02:29.310
ADAM GREEN: So you work
in some of the most

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.890
miserable and dangerous
places in the world, places

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:36.250
where there is effectively
active war going on.

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.440
And most of what we
hear is, how do they

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.370
get emergency aid-- enough
sutures, enough water,

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:42.770
enough plasma in there.

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:45.960
How do you guys get
in books, and lawyers,

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:50.665
and actually work with people on
building longer, better lives?

00:02:50.665 --> 00:02:52.040
SAMANTHA NUTT:
Well, I think Adam

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.460
you've hit on a really
good point, which

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:54.876
is that when we
think about crises

00:02:54.876 --> 00:02:57.710
in other parts of the world, and
especially war, unfortunately

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:59.100
our memories are pretty short.

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.630
And so we think about
the emergency phase--

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:04.440
so food, water, shelter,
blankets, vaccination programs,

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.680
the things that you need
to keep people alive.

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.810
But people also need
reasons to live.

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:13.112
And when wars drag on
as they so frequently

00:03:13.112 --> 00:03:14.820
do-- if you look at
the war in Syria now,

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:15.780
it's in its sixth year.

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.377
The war in Sudan has been,
apart from a few moments

00:03:18.377 --> 00:03:20.460
where it hasn't been as
intense, has been going on

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:22.690
for many decades now.

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:24.480
Other parts of the
Middle East, if you

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.690
look at the eastern Congo where
it's nearly 20 years, Somalia

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:31.360
where it's multiple decades,
as those wars drag on,

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:35.070
those gaps and those needs
become that much more enormous.

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:38.910
And unfortunately, our
capacity to remain involved

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:42.110
and demonstrate compassion
tends to dwindle

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:44.500
as those conflicts drag on.

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.250
And unfortunately, that's when
the needs become even greater.

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:50.406
Because you've got kids who have
been out of school for 5, 6,

00:03:50.406 --> 00:03:51.144
10 years.

00:03:51.144 --> 00:03:52.810
You've got families
that have completely

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:55.660
drained all of their
financial resources,

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:58.250
that have lost their land,
lost their livelihoods.

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:02.590
You have a legal infrastructure,
a protective environment

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:05.940
that has essentially been
destroyed where there may not

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:06.770
be any police.

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:09.300
There may not be a functioning
judicial infrastructure.

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:11.330
So if your rights
are being violated,

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:14.630
if you're being raped and
abused, you have no recourse.

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:17.220
And so that's what
War Child focuses on.

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:18.899
And in order to
do that, you have

00:04:18.899 --> 00:04:20.990
to mobilize those
local communities.

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:22.490
You have to make
sure that they have

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:24.860
the skills and the capacity
to be able to do the work,

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:26.474
that they have the resources.

00:04:26.474 --> 00:04:28.140
And fundamentally,
you have to make sure

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:30.620
that you have a
long-term vision.

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:33.800
War is a long-term problem.

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:38.030
And by continuing to
only plug those gaps,

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:39.980
we aren't, I think,
fundamentally

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:42.930
addressing the reasons why
some of these communities

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:45.920
tend to be locked in that
cycle of violence and poverty,

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:49.140
and frankly, despair
in the first place.

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:52.170
ADAM GREEN: So you mentioned
the war in the Congo.

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:54.890
We had the good fortune of
having Malala Yousufzai's

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:56.430
parents here the other week.

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:00.270
And he mentioned that
the children that

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:03.730
are sitting in camps today,
getting no education,

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:05.930
they are the ISIS of tomorrow.

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:07.960
They are the wars of tomorrow.

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:09.690
They are the
terrorists of tomorrow.

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:13.450
The DRC came to be one of the
worst wars in modern history.

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:15.980
There are an estimated 7 1/2
million kids there who are

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:19.610
getting no education.

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:21.210
Is that really the
demographic time

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:25.600
bomb that Malala's
dad was fearing?

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:27.650
SAMANTHA NUTT:
Certainly, it is true

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:31.300
that kids who have almost
nothing in environments

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:35.420
where there is a tremendous
amount of violence, where there

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:38.070
is recruitment that's going
on by various armed groups,

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:40.360
militia groups-- in
the case of the Congo,

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:44.750
it's an inordinate number of
people that are recruiting

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:46.970
and abducting young
people to fight

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:50.980
in that conflict in a
climate of absolute impunity.

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:54.060
So certainly, young
people who are unemployed,

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:58.220
who are not in school, who have
witnessed horrific abuses, who

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:01.060
have been the victims of
horrific abuses themselves,

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:04.420
they are certainly more
vulnerable to that level

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:09.550
of recruitment, to that
kind of ideological pull

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:11.900
that many of those armed
groups will offer them.

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:13.675
I mean, War Child
knows, even for the work

00:06:13.675 --> 00:06:15.300
that we have done
all around the world,

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:16.883
that when we have
done skills training

00:06:16.883 --> 00:06:19.640
with young people, when we
have worked with teachers

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:22.230
and other educators to make
sure that they had access

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:25.572
to education, could go back to
school at an appropriate grade

00:06:25.572 --> 00:06:27.780
level-- because if you're
17 and you've been fighting

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:29.752
with the militia
group in eastern Congo

00:06:29.752 --> 00:06:31.210
and you're functionally
illiterate,

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:33.200
you don't want to go back
to being in grade one

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:33.960
with a bunch of six-year-olds.

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:35.670
I mean, that's
humiliating for you.

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:37.140
So it becomes a huge barrier.

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:39.617
So yes, education is
critically important.

00:06:39.617 --> 00:06:40.950
It's not the only thing, though.

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:44.050
Economic development becomes
critically important.

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:46.740
Making sure that their
psychological needs are being

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:49.840
addressed and that
overarching framework

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:53.460
of a lack of accountability is
one of the biggest challenges,

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:54.015
too.

00:06:54.015 --> 00:06:56.640
ADAM GREEN: Yeah, you're make in
your book a pretty strong case

00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:58.460
that on the Venn
diagram of humanity

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:03.120
where cheap, small arms and
idle young men intersect

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:04.910
is a recipe for war.

00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:07.980
So bringing education
in hopefully

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:11.610
pulls the idle young men
out of that equation.

00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:15.530
But how far can you
get when AK-47s cost

00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:17.820
$10 in a lot of these places?

00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:19.080
Education is a huge part.

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:21.225
What about arms control?

00:07:21.225 --> 00:07:23.350
SAMANTHA NUTT: Arms control
is absolutely critical.

00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:27.350
And I think that it's
especially important right now

00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:28.600
that we talk about this issue.

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:32.070
When you look at the rise
of ISIS in the Middle East,

00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:35.480
if you look at even the
devastating attacks that

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:37.930
have taken place in
the United States,

00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:42.620
even in Orlando, Florida,
the easy availability

00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:45.530
of automatic and
semi-automatic weapons--

00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:50.220
small arms more generally--
creates both opportunity

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:54.550
and means for those
who seek to destroy

00:07:54.550 --> 00:07:57.120
and harm to be able to do so.

00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:59.050
And the proliferation
of small arms,

00:07:59.050 --> 00:08:01.140
especially in
unstable environments,

00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:03.970
is I think one of the
single greatest threats

00:08:03.970 --> 00:08:06.590
to public health and global
peace and security in existence

00:08:06.590 --> 00:08:07.540
in the world today.

00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:11.780
We have seen a dramatic increase
in the sale of those arms

00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:14.310
and the manufacturing of
those weapons since September

00:08:14.310 --> 00:08:18.730
11th over the past now
more than 15 years.

00:08:18.730 --> 00:08:21.180
And so if you have a
lawless environment where

00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:23.190
there is very little
employment where

00:08:23.190 --> 00:08:25.170
you've got half the
population roughly

00:08:25.170 --> 00:08:29.720
that is under the age of
30, and in some cases,

00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:32.159
under the age of
18, you are going

00:08:32.159 --> 00:08:34.760
to have a situation
where people will take up

00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:38.360
arms to resolve grievances,
to earn an income,

00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:44.000
and to express their will and
their particular ideology.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.950
So the arms, in
and of themselves,

00:08:46.950 --> 00:08:52.810
I mean, adding that
into the equation

00:08:52.810 --> 00:08:57.780
is one of the hardest issues
to address in a war zone.

00:08:57.780 --> 00:09:00.050
Disarmament is absolutely
critical to peace

00:09:00.050 --> 00:09:01.080
and prosperity.

00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:03.770
ADAM GREEN: And a lot of
the talk about armament

00:09:03.770 --> 00:09:06.140
revolves around the
locations where the arms are.

00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:10.420
But most of those guns are not
coming from sub-Saharan Africa

00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:11.337
or the Middle East.

00:09:11.337 --> 00:09:13.670
They're manufactured within
a couple kilometers of where

00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:14.960
we're sitting right now.

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:18.760
The United States is the largest
arms exporter in the world.

00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:22.020
And very recently with the
LAV deal in Saudi Arabia,

00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:23.754
Canada had the
dubious distinction

00:09:23.754 --> 00:09:26.420
of being declared the number two
arms dealer in the Middle East.

00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:26.660
SAMANTHA NUTT: We did.

00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:28.740
We just jumped to
number two, yeah.

00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:31.160
ADAM GREEN: So does that
talk need to happen here?

00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:34.270
Usually when we talk about
arms control and proliferation,

00:09:34.270 --> 00:09:35.620
it's on the nuclear scale.

00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:38.320
Like our militaries tend
to be obsessed with state

00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:40.040
versus state conflict.

00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:44.170
We're spending a trillion
dollars on the next fighter jet

00:09:44.170 --> 00:09:45.710
program, the F-35.

00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:48.730
That's the entire aid budget
of the world, roughly--

00:09:48.730 --> 00:09:51.300
the NGO budget.

00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:53.290
At what point does
arms control need

00:09:53.290 --> 00:09:56.800
to start talking about
like 20 caliber things that

00:09:56.800 --> 00:10:00.810
sit in someone's purse
in Texas but then can

00:10:00.810 --> 00:10:05.132
be used to end dozens of lives
in somewhere like Sierra Leone?

00:10:05.132 --> 00:10:06.590
SAMANTHA NUTT:
Well, I think you've

00:10:06.590 --> 00:10:10.715
asked-- there are multiple
pieces to that question, which

00:10:10.715 --> 00:10:13.340
is I think a very,
very important one.

00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:17.720
On the issue of small arms
being available and accessible,

00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:19.630
the problem with small
arms, many of them--

00:10:19.630 --> 00:10:21.080
look at the Kalashnikov rifle.

00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:22.900
They're virtually
indestructible.

00:10:22.900 --> 00:10:25.270
They are the preferred
weapon of child soldiers.

00:10:25.270 --> 00:10:26.040
ADAM GREEN: Yeah, it's
made to be buried in sand

00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:27.000
and still keep working.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:27.865
SAMANTHA NUTT: And so
if you make it here,

00:10:27.865 --> 00:10:29.040
or you make it
the United States,

00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:31.290
or it's made in Russia, or
in China, or wherever else,

00:10:31.290 --> 00:10:33.280
once it gets into an
international market,

00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:35.850
that is rarely its last stop.

00:10:35.850 --> 00:10:37.844
And some of the ones
that I have seen,

00:10:37.844 --> 00:10:39.260
and frankly, some
of the ones that

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:42.630
have been pointed at me
over the years by young men,

00:10:42.630 --> 00:10:45.200
have been weapons that were
made even in the '50s and '60s.

00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:47.880
They're very easy for
kids to load, and reload,

00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:49.440
and to be trained to use.

00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:53.470
So any weapon like that
that enters the marketplace,

00:10:53.470 --> 00:10:54.981
it is a permanent problem.

00:10:54.981 --> 00:10:56.230
It is not a temporary problem.

00:10:56.230 --> 00:10:58.000
So that's one piece of it.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:02.470
In terms of who contributes to
that, if you look at all weapon

00:11:02.470 --> 00:11:06.060
sales-- so that includes
everything-- roughly 80%

00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:10.520
of all weapons that are sold
in the world are manufactured

00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:13.660
by-- the United States
is roughly half.

00:11:13.660 --> 00:11:18.656
But then usually, it's England,
Germany, France, Russia, China.

00:11:18.656 --> 00:11:21.030
So roughly 80% of them come
from none other than the five

00:11:21.030 --> 00:11:23.450
permanent members of the United
Nations Security Council,

00:11:23.450 --> 00:11:25.090
plus Germany.

00:11:25.090 --> 00:11:29.206
Unfortunately now, Canada is
inching into that equation.

00:11:29.206 --> 00:11:30.830
And I think it's
something that we have

00:11:30.830 --> 00:11:32.960
to consider very carefully.

00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:35.990
Because it does,
I think, undermine

00:11:35.990 --> 00:11:37.570
our international reputation.

00:11:37.570 --> 00:11:39.820
And we as Canadians can
sometimes-- you know,

00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:42.560
we think that we're the
world's peacekeepers

00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:44.900
and that we have this
reputation around the world

00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:45.880
of human rights.

00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:47.796
ADAM GREEN: We're like
number 58 on the list--

00:11:47.796 --> 00:11:49.920
SAMANTHA NUTT: Yeah, and
we're not that anymore.

00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:54.390
And if we want to have that
kind of prominence on the world

00:11:54.390 --> 00:11:57.930
stage, and that credibility
and that reputation,

00:11:57.930 --> 00:12:02.080
then I personally think that
we have to really question

00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:05.050
whether or not our
arms exports are

00:12:05.050 --> 00:12:09.520
consistent with those
values of promoting peace,

00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:10.850
and security, and human rights.

00:12:10.850 --> 00:12:13.060
Because you can go to any
war zone around the world

00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:14.780
and know that that
is not the case.

00:12:14.780 --> 00:12:18.139
ADAM GREEN: So until we can
do that, do you feel like you

00:12:18.139 --> 00:12:19.680
guys at War Child
are kind of bailing

00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:23.830
the Titanic with a bucket as
you try to educate people out

00:12:23.830 --> 00:12:28.220
of this but almost
unlimited free weapons are

00:12:28.220 --> 00:12:31.374
coming in the other side?

00:12:31.374 --> 00:12:33.540
SAMANTHA NUTT: I think I
would look at that metaphor

00:12:33.540 --> 00:12:34.530
slightly differently.

00:12:34.530 --> 00:12:37.430
I feel like sometimes, you're
on the deck of the Titanic,

00:12:37.430 --> 00:12:38.930
and you can see the iceberg.

00:12:38.930 --> 00:12:42.850
You see kids and
the Syrian refugees

00:12:42.850 --> 00:12:45.530
living in camps,
who are becoming

00:12:45.530 --> 00:12:48.210
increasingly despondent because
they don't have opportunity.

00:12:48.210 --> 00:12:50.790
You see southern
Sudanese families

00:12:50.790 --> 00:12:54.990
who are selling their
children into arms groups

00:12:54.990 --> 00:12:56.491
because they've run
out of resources

00:12:56.491 --> 00:12:58.281
and because they're
increasingly desperate.

00:12:58.281 --> 00:13:00.450
So you feel like you're on
the deck of the Titanic.

00:13:00.450 --> 00:13:01.830
You can see the iceberg.

00:13:01.830 --> 00:13:03.205
And you're going,
hey, everybody.

00:13:03.205 --> 00:13:04.020
See iceberg.

00:13:04.020 --> 00:13:07.140
See the iceberg, right?

00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:09.160
And yet, it's not
enough to change course.

00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:12.370
And that's the part that's
incredibly frustrating

00:13:12.370 --> 00:13:15.590
for me and I think for
us as an organization.

00:13:15.590 --> 00:13:21.660
Because you can feel it on the
ground when it's happening.

00:13:21.660 --> 00:13:26.390
You can feel that shift, that
moment when people transition

00:13:26.390 --> 00:13:30.740
from being hopeful to that
sense of hopelessness, that

00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:33.180
sense that the world has
forgotten them, that nobody

00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:37.140
cares about what's
happening to them, that when

00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:40.080
that anger and that
resentment begin to build,

00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:43.160
when they feel
increasingly desperate.

00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:46.240
And it's no surprise
then that almost a year

00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:49.370
within that moment,
you start to see people

00:13:49.370 --> 00:13:51.930
putting their toddlers
into rubber dinghies

00:13:51.930 --> 00:13:55.570
and trying to make it
across the Mediterranean Sea

00:13:55.570 --> 00:13:58.147
to get them to safety.

00:13:58.147 --> 00:13:59.730
ADAM GREEN: Yeah,
when that's the best

00:13:59.730 --> 00:14:01.610
option for your
family, you things

00:14:01.610 --> 00:14:03.334
are unspeakably horrible.

00:14:03.334 --> 00:14:04.500
SAMANTHA NUTT: That's right.

00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:05.600
That's the problem.

00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:08.600
ADAM GREEN: So your
book is full of

00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:11.900
unbelievably harrowing
stories, things

00:14:11.900 --> 00:14:13.150
that you've gone through.

00:14:13.150 --> 00:14:14.650
One of the things
that struck me was

00:14:14.650 --> 00:14:19.734
the number of whip-smart,
incredibly brave educated women

00:14:19.734 --> 00:14:22.150
from around the world that
you've worked with who have met

00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:25.410
with horrible untimely ends.

00:14:25.410 --> 00:14:29.640
You make a really good case
for the education of women

00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:30.955
and girls around the world.

00:14:30.955 --> 00:14:32.830
As a father of two little
girls, I don't even

00:14:32.830 --> 00:14:35.160
think it's up for debate.

00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:37.890
But how risky is it?

00:14:37.890 --> 00:14:40.584
As we educate them, are
we sending more people

00:14:40.584 --> 00:14:42.500
to the slaughter if we're
not educating people

00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:46.170
on the other side, educating
the angry young men with the $10

00:14:46.170 --> 00:14:51.150
automatic rifles, as to what
society could and should look

00:14:51.150 --> 00:14:53.112
like if everyone was equal?

00:14:53.112 --> 00:14:54.570
SAMANTHA NUTT: You
have to do both.

00:14:54.570 --> 00:14:57.100
You don't have to do one
at the exclusion of others.

00:14:57.100 --> 00:14:59.160
So educating girls
doesn't mean that that

00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:01.887
comes at the expense
of educating boys.

00:15:01.887 --> 00:15:03.720
And we found that and
War Child's found that

00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:05.240
with our work all
around the world.

00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:07.620
If you're not
investing in what we

00:15:07.620 --> 00:15:09.390
call community-based
sensitization-- going

00:15:09.390 --> 00:15:12.060
into those communities,
talking about the value

00:15:12.060 --> 00:15:15.180
of girls' education,
demonstrating the importance

00:15:15.180 --> 00:15:18.220
of women's economic
empowerment, proving

00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:21.990
that to those communities
by having those women return

00:15:21.990 --> 00:15:23.910
and they do become very
productive members.

00:15:23.910 --> 00:15:28.510
And slowly, you see people's
minds and attitudes change.

00:15:28.510 --> 00:15:31.250
And you can't go in there
with this giant sort

00:15:31.250 --> 00:15:34.730
of imperialist agenda and your
finger wagging, and saying,

00:15:34.730 --> 00:15:36.670
it's got to be this
way and that's wrong.

00:15:36.670 --> 00:15:38.530
Because if you do that,
you're going to be shut out

00:15:38.530 --> 00:15:39.113
and shut down.

00:15:39.113 --> 00:15:41.670
And you may in fact put many
of those young girls or women

00:15:41.670 --> 00:15:44.260
that you want to be
helping at risk by virtue

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:45.860
of behaving in that fashion.

00:15:45.860 --> 00:15:47.740
ADAM GREEN: And there's
been some of that.

00:15:47.740 --> 00:15:53.210
Madonna had an education
effort that ended in flames,

00:15:53.210 --> 00:15:57.552
and Oprah and a few others.

00:15:57.552 --> 00:15:59.260
You offer some pretty
withering criticism

00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:01.843
in your book of people who just
come in with an outside agenda

00:16:01.843 --> 00:16:04.899
into a local area and say,
this is how it should be.

00:16:04.899 --> 00:16:06.940
How do you guys operate
differently at War Child?

00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:08.731
How do you make sure
you're not doing that?

00:16:08.731 --> 00:16:11.146
SAMANTHA NUTT: Well, for us,
98% of our staff are local.

00:16:11.146 --> 00:16:13.270
And we have several hundred
staff around the world.

00:16:13.270 --> 00:16:15.480
So these are folks who
come from war zones who

00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:17.420
are working for us
within those countries

00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:20.450
to build our programs,
to identify the needs,

00:16:20.450 --> 00:16:23.699
to evaluate them, to
make sure that we're

00:16:23.699 --> 00:16:25.490
asking the right
questions and that we have

00:16:25.490 --> 00:16:28.810
that level of community
legitimacy and acceptance

00:16:28.810 --> 00:16:30.580
before we even start.

00:16:30.580 --> 00:16:33.067
We are, as I said, we're not
an emergency organization.

00:16:33.067 --> 00:16:34.900
So we don't go in there
and say, well, we're

00:16:34.900 --> 00:16:36.066
in the business of blankets.

00:16:36.066 --> 00:16:37.360
So here's your blanket.

00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:38.450
That's not what we do.

00:16:38.450 --> 00:16:41.410
We go in, and we will have
a one, two-year process

00:16:41.410 --> 00:16:44.680
of information gathering;
of collaboration;

00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:47.570
of conversation with
local community groups,

00:16:47.570 --> 00:16:49.640
grassroots civil
society organizations,

00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:52.000
UN agencies, other
organizations on the ground,

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.170
to say, OK, what contribution
can we make here?

00:16:55.170 --> 00:16:56.290
What are the needs?

00:16:56.290 --> 00:16:57.560
What needs are not being met?

00:16:57.560 --> 00:16:59.940
What is the overall risk to
children in that community

00:16:59.940 --> 00:17:01.610
by not meeting those needs?

00:17:01.610 --> 00:17:03.330
And how can we help you?

00:17:03.330 --> 00:17:05.790
And I think that that
fundamentally is the question.

00:17:05.790 --> 00:17:08.589
If you go in and say, this is
how we're going to help you,

00:17:08.589 --> 00:17:10.310
that's how aid goes wrong.

00:17:10.310 --> 00:17:14.450
If you go in and say, tell me
about what's going on here.

00:17:14.450 --> 00:17:15.359
How can we help you?

00:17:15.359 --> 00:17:16.790
And you and you
build it, and you

00:17:16.790 --> 00:17:19.740
were critical in that
process, and ask yourself

00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:21.526
the hard questions,
it doesn't mean

00:17:21.526 --> 00:17:22.650
you'll always get it right.

00:17:22.650 --> 00:17:24.390
But it means you're more
likely to get it right.

00:17:24.390 --> 00:17:26.264
ADAM GREEN: So come with
more question marks,

00:17:26.264 --> 00:17:27.657
less exclamation points.

00:17:27.657 --> 00:17:28.740
SAMANTHA NUTT: Absolutely.

00:17:28.740 --> 00:17:30.240
And you see that
in a lot of crises.

00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:32.142
You see a lot of grandstanding.

00:17:32.142 --> 00:17:34.600
And for me over the years, you
know, I've been in this work

00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:35.330
for 20 years.

00:17:35.330 --> 00:17:37.320
It's kind of been the
bane of my existence.

00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:39.750
People who have no experience
in Iraq and they've

00:17:39.750 --> 00:17:41.500
been there for two
days, and they stand up

00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:43.150
and they say, children
are starving here

00:17:43.150 --> 00:17:45.080
And you look at them, and
you go, where the hell

00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:45.663
have you been?

00:17:45.663 --> 00:17:48.040
Yes, they have been starving
there for last 10 years,

00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:49.630
actually, thanks
to the sanctions.

00:17:49.630 --> 00:17:50.350
But--

00:17:50.350 --> 00:17:51.040
ADAM GREEN: Into
the ninth inning.

00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:51.640
SAMANTHA NUTT: Yeah, welcome.

00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:54.223
ADAM GREEN: We've been playing
this baseball game for a while.

00:17:54.223 --> 00:17:55.850
SAMANTHA NUTT: That's right.

00:17:55.850 --> 00:17:59.070
ADAM GREEN: You also offer
some pretty heavy criticism

00:17:59.070 --> 00:18:01.450
of well-meaning do-gooders.

00:18:01.450 --> 00:18:05.790
How can we, in the
privileged West,

00:18:05.790 --> 00:18:10.110
help folks that
actually is productive?

00:18:10.110 --> 00:18:14.210
You're pretty critical of
things like voluntourism,

00:18:14.210 --> 00:18:17.214
of ping-pong ball funding
where fund the government that

00:18:17.214 --> 00:18:19.380
funds the UN that then funds
their local region that

00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:20.380
then funds an NGO.

00:18:20.380 --> 00:18:23.560
And by the time someone in
need actually gets the money,

00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:26.560
it's like small
pennies on the dollar.

00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:29.067
What can we do that's actually
effective from this end?

00:18:29.067 --> 00:18:31.150
SAMANTHA NUTT: Well, there
are a number of things.

00:18:31.150 --> 00:18:32.760
I mean, the more
directly you can

00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:35.724
contribute to an organization
that is working on the ground

00:18:35.724 --> 00:18:37.390
and with those
grassroots partners, that

00:18:37.390 --> 00:18:39.473
means that your money is
going to go much further.

00:18:39.473 --> 00:18:41.380
So every time, if
[INAUDIBLE] organization

00:18:41.380 --> 00:18:43.620
that then has an
international arm, and then it

00:18:43.620 --> 00:18:45.590
gets kind of divided
and divided and divided,

00:18:45.590 --> 00:18:47.550
and it will end up
at the field level,

00:18:47.550 --> 00:18:49.280
the impact of your
dollar is diluted.

00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:51.030
So that's something
to be very mindful of,

00:18:51.030 --> 00:18:52.160
is to always make sure.

00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:55.300
Ask organizations, what is
their programming model?

00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:57.400
Are they a directly
implementing agency?

00:18:57.400 --> 00:19:00.800
Because that's
very, very critical.

00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:03.660
The second piece of it is
so much of our aid money

00:19:03.660 --> 00:19:05.900
is wasted because of one thing.

00:19:05.900 --> 00:19:08.370
And that one thing
is inconsistency.

00:19:08.370 --> 00:19:10.060
Because we see a
crisis in the news.

00:19:10.060 --> 00:19:13.090
We might write a check once,
or go online and donate.

00:19:13.090 --> 00:19:15.750
And then here we are five, six,
seven years later going, well,

00:19:15.750 --> 00:19:18.190
why don't things get any
better in places like Haiti?

00:19:18.190 --> 00:19:19.810
I mean, these kinds
of challenges,

00:19:19.810 --> 00:19:21.880
you're really talking
about structural deficits.

00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:24.330
And like anything
else, it takes time.

00:19:24.330 --> 00:19:26.930
And so we know here, if you're
talking about education,

00:19:26.930 --> 00:19:30.020
it's not enough to send a kid to
school for a week, or a month,

00:19:30.020 --> 00:19:30.840
or even a year.

00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:32.690
It is a long-term investment.

00:19:32.690 --> 00:19:34.910
So you're far better
off as a donor

00:19:34.910 --> 00:19:36.940
giving a-- and
this is always when

00:19:36.940 --> 00:19:39.200
my head director of
development has a heart attack.

00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:42.250
But now he's going,
don't say this.

00:19:42.250 --> 00:19:45.470
But you're far better off
giving a smaller amount of money

00:19:45.470 --> 00:19:48.900
on a regular basis than you
are writing a check once

00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:50.540
and then forgetting about it.

00:19:50.540 --> 00:19:52.250
It allows organizations
to properly

00:19:52.250 --> 00:19:55.695
plan, to implement in areas that
the world has often forgotten

00:19:55.695 --> 00:19:57.620
and has shown less interest in.

00:19:57.620 --> 00:20:01.620
It allows you to direct those
resources to the highest need

00:20:01.620 --> 00:20:04.310
environments and
not be so subjected

00:20:04.310 --> 00:20:08.360
to the whims and mercies of
the media cycle, for example.

00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:09.710
So that's one way to do it.

00:20:09.710 --> 00:20:11.996
Don't give things
like hard goods--

00:20:11.996 --> 00:20:13.620
clothes, and books,
and all that stuff.

00:20:13.620 --> 00:20:15.115
It won't get there
in time to be useful.

00:20:15.115 --> 00:20:16.900
It's too expensive to
ship and distribute.

00:20:16.900 --> 00:20:18.540
ADAM GREEN: Yeah, cash flies
a lot cheaper than books.

00:20:18.540 --> 00:20:20.041
SAMANTHA NUTT: Cash
is a lot better.

00:20:20.041 --> 00:20:21.915
You know, it's a much
better way of doing it.

00:20:21.915 --> 00:20:23.380
And in fact, many
organizations now

00:20:23.380 --> 00:20:25.490
are looking at cash
vouchers for refugees

00:20:25.490 --> 00:20:27.660
because then they can
make their own decisions

00:20:27.660 --> 00:20:30.000
around what their family needs.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:31.807
We have this very
paternalistic approach.

00:20:31.807 --> 00:20:33.390
It's like, no, you're
going to have 10

00:20:33.390 --> 00:20:34.752
bags of rice and six blankets.

00:20:34.752 --> 00:20:36.210
And a lot of those
refugee families

00:20:36.210 --> 00:20:38.190
are sitting there saying,
actually, I don't eat rice

00:20:38.190 --> 00:20:39.230
and I've got enough blankets.

00:20:39.230 --> 00:20:40.200
But that's not how we do it.

00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:40.320
ADAM GREEN: It's very hot here.

00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:41.400
I don't need more blankets.

00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:43.066
SAMANTHA NUTT: And
so now we're changing

00:20:43.066 --> 00:20:47.420
that attitude and making it
certainly more empowering,

00:20:47.420 --> 00:20:50.600
but also some recognizing the
value of cash contributions.

00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:56.580
And gifts in kind like labor are
extremely valuable, especially

00:20:56.580 --> 00:20:59.960
to organizations that might
have headquarters locally.

00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:01.730
People have various
skills that they

00:21:01.730 --> 00:21:03.810
can bring to our organization.

00:21:03.810 --> 00:21:06.690
But that volunteer work is
most helpful to us here.

00:21:06.690 --> 00:21:09.750
Unless you are a
seasoned expert who

00:21:09.750 --> 00:21:12.240
understands development,
understands the context,

00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:14.539
understands the risks
involved, frankly,

00:21:14.539 --> 00:21:16.830
when you're going overseas
and doing this kind of work,

00:21:16.830 --> 00:21:18.670
you might be taking
those opportunities away

00:21:18.670 --> 00:21:20.086
from local community
groups, which

00:21:20.086 --> 00:21:21.470
is something to be mindful of.

00:21:21.470 --> 00:21:23.750
A lot of it is busy
work philanthropy.

00:21:23.750 --> 00:21:26.080
Do you really need to go
and repaint that classroom?

00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:28.080
Or is there somebody
else that, with money

00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:30.820
you save on your ticket,
could be hired locally--

00:21:30.820 --> 00:21:32.370
ADAM GREEN: Perhaps
a local painter.

00:21:32.370 --> 00:21:34.304
SAMANTHA NUTT: --to
paint that classroom.

00:21:34.304 --> 00:21:35.720
And then the second
piece of it is

00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:38.060
it's a huge security
risk for most agencies.

00:21:38.060 --> 00:21:39.560
So sometimes, the
better way for you

00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:43.140
to contribute-- in fact, often,
the better way to contribute

00:21:43.140 --> 00:21:47.260
is to be a donor and to
help here if you can.

00:21:47.260 --> 00:21:48.595
ADAM GREEN: Excellent.

00:21:48.595 --> 00:21:50.720
So I want to bring you back
to Google for a second.

00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:52.546
We have this mantra,
don't be evil.

00:21:52.546 --> 00:21:53.920
We all like to
think of ourselves

00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:55.660
as really good people.

00:21:55.660 --> 00:21:59.600
But pretty much all of
us have a tiny slice

00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:01.967
of unspeakable evil
sitting in our pocket

00:22:01.967 --> 00:22:03.800
right now-- the minerals
that go into these,

00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:06.370
particularly coltan
mined in the DRC

00:22:06.370 --> 00:22:10.310
is an engine of human misery.

00:22:10.310 --> 00:22:12.110
Why do you think the
industry collectively

00:22:12.110 --> 00:22:14.010
can't get on top of that?

00:22:14.010 --> 00:22:16.150
We did it with diamonds.

00:22:16.150 --> 00:22:19.460
Why not other minerals?

00:22:19.460 --> 00:22:22.780
SAMANTHA NUTT: It's a lot more
complicated than diamonds.

00:22:22.780 --> 00:22:24.950
And I'm not offering
that up as an excuse

00:22:24.950 --> 00:22:26.620
but more of an explanation.

00:22:26.620 --> 00:22:29.169
I mean, you can take a
diamond and look at it

00:22:29.169 --> 00:22:31.460
under a microscope and know
exactly where it came from.

00:22:31.460 --> 00:22:34.490
And so conflict tracing in
that sort of environment

00:22:34.490 --> 00:22:37.740
became somewhat easier
than with coltan.

00:22:37.740 --> 00:22:41.100
I mean, coltan, it's estimated
that the Congo contains

00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:44.350
between 60% to 80% of the
world's coltan deposits.

00:22:44.350 --> 00:22:46.700
It is readily smuggled
across Congo's borders

00:22:46.700 --> 00:22:49.060
and ends up in
international markets.

00:22:49.060 --> 00:22:52.820
It generates hundreds of
millions of dollars in revenues

00:22:52.820 --> 00:22:56.630
and often use towards arms sales
for various Congolese-backed

00:22:56.630 --> 00:22:58.130
military groups
and militia groups

00:22:58.130 --> 00:23:00.190
operating in that unstable
part of the world.

00:23:00.190 --> 00:23:01.981
But by the time it gets
to your cell phone,

00:23:01.981 --> 00:23:04.270
you have no idea whether
it's Congolese coltan

00:23:04.270 --> 00:23:06.420
or any other kind of coltain.

00:23:06.420 --> 00:23:08.130
Chances are, just
based on probability,

00:23:08.130 --> 00:23:10.170
it is Congolese coltan.

00:23:10.170 --> 00:23:12.630
I think, to be honest,
this is an issue

00:23:12.630 --> 00:23:15.850
that the industry itself
needs to actively get

00:23:15.850 --> 00:23:21.000
behind and start to look at
what solutions are viable

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:22.220
and make the most sense.

00:23:22.220 --> 00:23:26.060
A straight-out
ban, unfortunately,

00:23:26.060 --> 00:23:28.580
follows the law of
unintended consequences.

00:23:28.580 --> 00:23:30.850
And under the Dodd-Frank
legislation in the United

00:23:30.850 --> 00:23:34.720
States that required sort
of more accountability

00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:38.620
and companies not to
use conflict minerals,

00:23:38.620 --> 00:23:40.370
what happened was a
lot of American firms

00:23:40.370 --> 00:23:43.200
closed their mines that put
a lot of artisanal miners out

00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:44.026
of work.

00:23:44.026 --> 00:23:45.900
And what happens when
you have no employment?

00:23:45.900 --> 00:23:48.540
You join a militia group because
they are the only employer--

00:23:48.540 --> 00:23:50.990
so again, the laws of
unintended consequences.

00:23:50.990 --> 00:23:54.560
What we really need
is sectoral reform.

00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:57.560
We need to look at how you
fix the climate of impunity

00:23:57.560 --> 00:23:58.720
at the same time.

00:23:58.720 --> 00:24:00.220
You have to come
at it from a number

00:24:00.220 --> 00:24:02.540
of different perspectives.

00:24:02.540 --> 00:24:06.400
It can be done, but none
of that will ever happen

00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:07.900
unless one other thing happens.

00:24:07.900 --> 00:24:10.180
And that's that
the industry itself

00:24:10.180 --> 00:24:13.280
has to be prepared
to confront this

00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:15.590
in an honest and
transparent way.

00:24:15.590 --> 00:24:17.840
ADAM GREEN: The tech industry,
or the mining industry,

00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:18.000
or both?

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:20.380
SAMANTHA NUTT: The entire
industry-- tech and mining

00:24:20.380 --> 00:24:22.220
because the two really
go hand in hand.

00:24:22.220 --> 00:24:23.620
ADAM GREEN: Yeah, and we're
sitting in a very unique place.

00:24:23.620 --> 00:24:25.090
We're at a big tech company.

00:24:25.090 --> 00:24:27.660
And within a 10-block
radius of this office

00:24:27.660 --> 00:24:30.710
is the highest concentration
of mining company headquarters

00:24:30.710 --> 00:24:31.400
in the world.

00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:33.550
So we might be, in this
office, somewhat uniquely

00:24:33.550 --> 00:24:35.100
placed to tackle this issue.

00:24:35.100 --> 00:24:37.600
SAMANTHA NUTT: You are uniquely
placed to tackle this issue.

00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:39.950
And every time any
effort has been

00:24:39.950 --> 00:24:43.020
brought about to
introduce legislation

00:24:43.020 --> 00:24:45.350
around this that
would force, frankly,

00:24:45.350 --> 00:24:47.730
mining companies to be more
accountable and transparent,

00:24:47.730 --> 00:24:51.226
it's been met by very heavy
lobbying, expensive lobbying,

00:24:51.226 --> 00:24:52.850
on the part of those
mining industries.

00:24:52.850 --> 00:24:54.052
And it has been shut down.

00:24:54.052 --> 00:24:55.843
ADAM GREEN: Yeah, bill
C-300 got shut down.

00:24:55.843 --> 00:24:56.690
SAMANTHA NUTT: That's right.

00:24:56.690 --> 00:24:58.106
ADAM GREEN: Very
narrowly, though.

00:24:58.106 --> 00:24:59.624
It was only like 10 votes.

00:24:59.624 --> 00:25:01.040
SAMANTHA NUTT: And
then Paul Dewar

00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:02.390
was trying to
introduce legislation

00:25:02.390 --> 00:25:04.100
as well, who is the
NDP foreign affairs

00:25:04.100 --> 00:25:06.450
critic who lost a seat
recently in the election.

00:25:06.450 --> 00:25:10.620
But he also had taken
steps around this issue.

00:25:10.620 --> 00:25:14.820
And again, I don't want to--
the answers are not simple.

00:25:14.820 --> 00:25:17.630
It does need a
development approach.

00:25:17.630 --> 00:25:19.900
It needs a governance approach.

00:25:19.900 --> 00:25:22.600
It needs a diplomatic approach.

00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:25.240
But all of that
can happen as long

00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:28.560
as there is acknowledgement from
the industry and a willingness

00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:30.850
to lead change.

00:25:30.850 --> 00:25:32.862
And if we can even
start there and begin

00:25:32.862 --> 00:25:34.070
to have those conversations--

00:25:34.070 --> 00:25:35.735
ADAM GREEN: Just recognize
that we have a problem.

00:25:35.735 --> 00:25:36.800
SAMANTHA NUTT: Recognize
we have a problem,

00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:38.970
and that's exactly what
happened with conflict diamonds.

00:25:38.970 --> 00:25:40.870
For a while, the industry was
like, there isn't a problem.

00:25:40.870 --> 00:25:41.786
There isn't a problem.

00:25:41.786 --> 00:25:44.460
And they ran from it and
they lobbied against it.

00:25:44.460 --> 00:25:46.550
And then finally, they
said, we do have a problem.

00:25:46.550 --> 00:25:48.780
The Kimberly Process
is imperfect.

00:25:48.780 --> 00:25:50.530
The fact that Zimbabwean
diamonds were not

00:25:50.530 --> 00:25:54.350
considered conflict diamonds
is a huge gaping hole

00:25:54.350 --> 00:25:55.630
in that process.

00:25:55.630 --> 00:25:57.550
But it's a step in
the right direction.

00:25:57.550 --> 00:26:00.110
And even if it's
imperfect to start,

00:26:00.110 --> 00:26:01.569
at least we're
making that effort.

00:26:01.569 --> 00:26:02.860
ADAM GREEN: Yeah, do something.

00:26:02.860 --> 00:26:03.660
Something is better
than nothing.

00:26:03.660 --> 00:26:05.610
SAMANTHA NUTT: Something is
usually better than nothing.

00:26:05.610 --> 00:26:06.190
ADAM GREEN: Usually.

00:26:06.190 --> 00:26:07.148
SAMANTHA NUTT: Usually.

00:26:07.148 --> 00:26:08.270
ADAM GREEN: That's fair.

00:26:08.270 --> 00:26:10.890
So I want to change
gears a little

00:26:10.890 --> 00:26:11.990
and go to you personally.

00:26:11.990 --> 00:26:15.640
You're a physician, an
author, an assistant professor

00:26:15.640 --> 00:26:19.980
at the U of T, a
mother, a board member,

00:26:19.980 --> 00:26:23.510
and the founder and executive
director of War Child Canada.

00:26:23.510 --> 00:26:26.520
And you're also in the midst
of setting up War Child US.

00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:27.725
When exactly do you sleep?

00:26:30.314 --> 00:26:32.480
SAMANTHA NUTT: Between 3:00
and 5:00 in the morning.

00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:35.447
No, sleep is
overrated, is it not?

00:26:35.447 --> 00:26:36.488
ADAM GREEN: No, it's not.

00:26:36.488 --> 00:26:39.732
It is a glorious,
glorious part of life.

00:26:39.732 --> 00:26:40.940
You should try it more often.

00:26:40.940 --> 00:26:42.315
SAMANTHA NUTT: No
one is claiming

00:26:42.315 --> 00:26:46.210
I'm doing all of those
things well, by the way.

00:26:46.210 --> 00:26:46.930
You know what?

00:26:46.930 --> 00:26:49.150
I mean, it's one
of those things--

00:26:49.150 --> 00:26:51.310
and this is going
to sound so trite,

00:26:51.310 --> 00:26:52.610
and I apologize in advance.

00:26:52.610 --> 00:26:55.610
But when you do what
you love, there really

00:26:55.610 --> 00:26:57.780
is no distinction
between your on-time

00:26:57.780 --> 00:26:59.040
and your off-time, right?

00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:02.540
So when I'm reading, I'm
reading about foreign policy

00:27:02.540 --> 00:27:03.470
and global issues.

00:27:03.470 --> 00:27:06.050
When I'm sitting around
the dinner table,

00:27:06.050 --> 00:27:08.650
we're discussing and
debating these issues.

00:27:08.650 --> 00:27:13.100
And you know, and I have a
limitless passion for the work

00:27:13.100 --> 00:27:15.420
that War Child does
around the world.

00:27:15.420 --> 00:27:20.220
And so not championing
that, it feels

00:27:20.220 --> 00:27:25.580
like I'm just being disconnected
from myself in many ways.

00:27:25.580 --> 00:27:29.630
So for me, I'm not
tired by what I do.

00:27:29.630 --> 00:27:30.780
I'm energized by it.

00:27:30.780 --> 00:27:33.560
I get more tired when
I'm not doing it,

00:27:33.560 --> 00:27:38.180
when I feel that I
haven't done enough.

00:27:38.180 --> 00:27:40.180
And that's when I
feel most frustrated.

00:27:40.180 --> 00:27:42.055
ADAM GREEN: It's like
the ultimate substitute

00:27:42.055 --> 00:27:42.890
for coffee for you.

00:27:42.890 --> 00:27:49.780
SAMANTHA NUTT: It is, yes--
well, coffee or-- I was

00:27:49.780 --> 00:27:53.680
going to say wine there,
but-- [LAUGHS] --but I

00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:55.431
still like my wine.

00:27:55.431 --> 00:27:55.930
The--

00:27:55.930 --> 00:27:57.110
ADAM GREEN: These aren't
mutually exclusive.

00:27:57.110 --> 00:27:57.560
SAMANTHA NUTT:
Yeah, that's right.

00:27:57.560 --> 00:27:58.360
ADAM GREEN: You can
still have wine.

00:27:58.360 --> 00:27:59.526
SAMANTHA NUTT: That's right.

00:27:59.526 --> 00:28:02.310
No, I'm lucky, you know.

00:28:02.310 --> 00:28:04.390
I get to do what I'm
passionate about,

00:28:04.390 --> 00:28:06.880
and we can't all
say that in life.

00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:08.342
ADAM GREEN: That's fantastic.

00:28:08.342 --> 00:28:10.300
Do you guys have any
questions in the audience?

00:28:10.300 --> 00:28:12.680
I want to be cognizant
and not just hog the mic

00:28:12.680 --> 00:28:13.980
the whole time.

00:28:13.980 --> 00:28:16.230
Yeah, Margo, just go just
go up to the mic if you can.

00:28:16.230 --> 00:28:16.729
[INAUDIBLE].

00:28:19.322 --> 00:28:21.030
AUDIENCE: You talked
a little bit earlier

00:28:21.030 --> 00:28:26.080
about Canadian's perception
as being peacekeepers when

00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:29.090
the reality is that we are a
big part and a growing part

00:28:29.090 --> 00:28:30.930
of the distribution of weapons.

00:28:30.930 --> 00:28:34.020
I'm curious if you've
had a chance to sit down

00:28:34.020 --> 00:28:38.190
with our relatively new
government, Prime Minister

00:28:38.190 --> 00:28:40.760
Trudeau or anybody
in his circle,

00:28:40.760 --> 00:28:44.670
and what their view is
on where we are today

00:28:44.670 --> 00:28:48.150
and trying to correct
some of these issues

00:28:48.150 --> 00:28:50.407
that we might be
contributing towards.

00:28:50.407 --> 00:28:52.240
SAMANTHA NUTT: That's
an excellent question.

00:28:52.240 --> 00:28:55.090
And I have had some
of those conversations

00:28:55.090 --> 00:28:57.870
and they are certainly ongoing.

00:28:57.870 --> 00:29:00.075
And I have testified
at the state committee

00:29:00.075 --> 00:29:01.700
of foreign affairs
over the last couple

00:29:01.700 --> 00:29:04.189
of years on a few of
these related issues.

00:29:04.189 --> 00:29:05.980
I think one of the most
significant things,

00:29:05.980 --> 00:29:08.190
though, that Canada can
do and should be doing

00:29:08.190 --> 00:29:10.870
is signing the
Arms Trade Treaty.

00:29:10.870 --> 00:29:14.970
The Arms Trade Treaty was
initially a Canadian led effort

00:29:14.970 --> 00:29:17.580
to try to bring about
international binding

00:29:17.580 --> 00:29:20.450
legislation concerning the
sale, the manufacturing,

00:29:20.450 --> 00:29:23.370
the stockpiling and the transfer
of small and light weapons

00:29:23.370 --> 00:29:24.300
in the world.

00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:27.490
And about two years
ago now, in fact,

00:29:27.490 --> 00:29:29.930
it finally passed through
the United Nations.

00:29:29.930 --> 00:29:32.870
And more than 115 countries
have signed on to it.

00:29:32.870 --> 00:29:36.810
Unfortunately, along
with Russia and China,

00:29:36.810 --> 00:29:39.490
Canada has not yet signed
the Arms Trade Treaty.

00:29:39.490 --> 00:29:42.110
And because we missed
the first deadline,

00:29:42.110 --> 00:29:45.800
now we have to pass a whole
series of pieces of legislation

00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:48.450
before were even
eligible to sign it.

00:29:48.450 --> 00:29:52.320
And there is-- and I'm going to
be very, very clear on this one

00:29:52.320 --> 00:29:52.960
point.

00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:57.290
There is no way that if we had
signed the Arms Trade Treaty,

00:29:57.290 --> 00:29:59.270
we would have been
able to approve

00:29:59.270 --> 00:30:03.480
that $15 billion arms deal to
Saudi Arabia, or to Thailand

00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:04.190
subsequently.

00:30:04.190 --> 00:30:09.360
So now, the current
government has

00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:11.870
committed to signing
the Arms Trade Treaty,

00:30:11.870 --> 00:30:17.800
but there has been no official
deadline prescribed in relation

00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:19.350
to that.

00:30:19.350 --> 00:30:22.750
And because it is contingent
upon these other pieces

00:30:22.750 --> 00:30:25.090
of legislation
falling into place,

00:30:25.090 --> 00:30:27.250
I don't know how long
that's going to take,

00:30:27.250 --> 00:30:30.080
or if it is even going to
be during this particular

00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:31.470
parliamentary cycle.

00:30:31.470 --> 00:30:32.926
I hope that it is.

00:30:32.926 --> 00:30:37.630
It Is absolutely the
right thing to do.

00:30:37.630 --> 00:30:41.690
And as we talk about
reengaging with the world

00:30:41.690 --> 00:30:45.720
and revitalizing our
multilateralist traditions

00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:49.580
as a country, we certainly
need to understand

00:30:49.580 --> 00:30:52.690
that our absence from
the Arms Trade Treaty

00:30:52.690 --> 00:30:56.170
and the reputation, in many
instances, of our mining sector

00:30:56.170 --> 00:30:59.630
and some of the violations
of human rights and labor

00:30:59.630 --> 00:31:05.000
violations in relation to
that, that that has really

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:08.930
thrown some of our
credibility into question.

00:31:08.930 --> 00:31:10.680
And so if we really
want to get there,

00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:15.370
if we want to still be seen as
that strong, vibrant, ethical

00:31:15.370 --> 00:31:17.660
force in the world,
then we do have

00:31:17.660 --> 00:31:19.930
to get some of these
other pieces in order.

00:31:19.930 --> 00:31:22.425
So hopefully, they'll see
that as one in the same.

00:31:22.425 --> 00:31:24.800
ADAM GREEN: We have a lot of
good intentions as a nation.

00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:27.460
We need to start
actually acting on them.

00:31:27.460 --> 00:31:28.490
SAMANTHA NUTT: Yeah.

00:31:28.490 --> 00:31:30.050
But we've made some
strides, though.

00:31:30.050 --> 00:31:30.550
We have.

00:31:30.550 --> 00:31:32.300
ADAM GREEN: Margo, who
could you ask, just

00:31:32.300 --> 00:31:34.181
because there are people on VC.

00:31:34.181 --> 00:31:35.680
AUDIENCE: And what
was the reasoning

00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:39.172
for missing the
first opportunity?

00:31:39.172 --> 00:31:41.630
SAMANTHA NUTT: It was under
the last government, the Harper

00:31:41.630 --> 00:31:43.790
government.

00:31:43.790 --> 00:31:46.134
And they did not sign
the arms trade treaty

00:31:46.134 --> 00:31:47.425
when they had that opportunity.

00:31:47.425 --> 00:31:50.900
And in fact, the domestic
gun lobby in Canada

00:31:50.900 --> 00:31:52.210
did a pretty good job.

00:31:52.210 --> 00:31:56.149
Even though it has nothing to
do with domestic gun ownership,

00:31:56.149 --> 00:31:57.940
they did a pretty good
job of making people

00:31:57.940 --> 00:32:02.180
feel that it was an effort-- the
NRA did the same in the United

00:32:02.180 --> 00:32:08.890
States-- an effort to control
domestic arms sales and use.

00:32:08.890 --> 00:32:09.774
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:32:09.774 --> 00:32:11.940
SAMANTHA NUTT: It's like
anything else with the arms

00:32:11.940 --> 00:32:12.439
industry.

00:32:12.439 --> 00:32:16.320
There's a lot more
propaganda and irrational

00:32:16.320 --> 00:32:18.050
thinking out there
on this subject

00:32:18.050 --> 00:32:21.177
than there is fact
and honest appraisal.

00:32:21.177 --> 00:32:23.010
ADAM GREEN: And you
have a very small number

00:32:23.010 --> 00:32:25.950
of interests, both
numerically and monetary,

00:32:25.950 --> 00:32:28.480
who seem to hold the
entire agenda hostage.

00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:30.500
In the US, there's a
huge debate going on.

00:32:30.500 --> 00:32:33.110
I think they may actually
still be debating in Congress.

00:32:33.110 --> 00:32:36.501
They had a filibuster all night.

00:32:36.501 --> 00:32:39.904
The majority of Americans
support efforts like this.

00:32:39.904 --> 00:32:42.070
The majority of Canadians
support efforts like this.

00:32:42.070 --> 00:32:44.150
But a tiny group
of vested interests

00:32:44.150 --> 00:32:46.310
can block that legislation.

00:32:46.310 --> 00:32:48.375
How important do you
think political activism

00:32:48.375 --> 00:32:50.000
is on the part of
individuals-- writing

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:52.330
to our members of parliament,
writing to our senators,

00:32:52.330 --> 00:32:55.260
writing to our congresspeople?

00:32:55.260 --> 00:32:57.890
SAMANTHA NUTT: I think
it's absolutely critical.

00:32:57.890 --> 00:33:00.390
Politicians are swayed
by public opinion.

00:33:00.390 --> 00:33:00.976
And--

00:33:00.976 --> 00:33:03.100
ADAM GREEN: Strongly worded
letters really do work.

00:33:03.100 --> 00:33:04.330
SAMANTHA NUTT: And there
isn't a politician out there

00:33:04.330 --> 00:33:06.620
that isn't concerned
about re-election.

00:33:06.620 --> 00:33:10.830
So if you have enough people
who are mounting an opposition

00:33:10.830 --> 00:33:13.834
to a particular policy, a
particular point of view,

00:33:13.834 --> 00:33:15.500
politicians are going
to listen to that.

00:33:15.500 --> 00:33:18.083
Part of the reason why the Arms
Trade Treaty didn't get signed

00:33:18.083 --> 00:33:20.940
is that there simply wasn't
enough public interest

00:33:20.940 --> 00:33:24.070
or concern or outcry that
we hadn't signed it yet.

00:33:24.070 --> 00:33:25.112
And that's a great shame.

00:33:25.112 --> 00:33:27.195
And I think the same applies
to the United States.

00:33:27.195 --> 00:33:29.010
When you have the
majority of Americans

00:33:29.010 --> 00:33:33.200
who are at least
committed to introducing

00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:36.770
certain aspects of gun control
legislation around particularly

00:33:36.770 --> 00:33:40.930
semiautomatic weapons
like the AR-15, people who

00:33:40.930 --> 00:33:43.290
are on a terrorist
watch list-- we're

00:33:43.290 --> 00:33:47.100
talking about people who have
a very clear mental health

00:33:47.100 --> 00:33:49.610
history that would be
deemed to be high risk.

00:33:49.610 --> 00:33:51.530
I mean, that is a
public safety issue.

00:33:51.530 --> 00:33:53.530
ADAM GREEN: People on the
terrorist no-fly list.

00:33:53.530 --> 00:33:55.655
SAMANTHA NUTT: People on
the terrorist no-fly list.

00:33:55.655 --> 00:33:57.010
That is a public safety issue.

00:33:57.010 --> 00:34:01.520
And they are right to be
shaming and embarrassing those

00:34:01.520 --> 00:34:04.640
legislators who cannot get
behind what the majority

00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:06.517
of Americans want.

00:34:06.517 --> 00:34:08.100
ADAM GREEN: Yeah,
even here in Canada,

00:34:08.100 --> 00:34:09.850
we had a member
of parliament who

00:34:09.850 --> 00:34:14.090
was making the case the AR-15
is a perfectly safe device when

00:34:14.090 --> 00:34:15.159
handled properly.

00:34:15.159 --> 00:34:16.210
So is heroin.

00:34:16.210 --> 00:34:17.280
So is plutonium.

00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:19.888
We don't let you
have that either.

00:34:19.888 --> 00:34:22.429
And also made the case that it's
a great deer hunting weapon.

00:34:22.429 --> 00:34:25.044
I've never seen anybody
go hunting with an AR-15.

00:34:25.044 --> 00:34:26.710
SAMANTHA NUTT: And
that's a great point.

00:34:26.710 --> 00:34:27.730
And I would add to that too.

00:34:27.730 --> 00:34:30.355
People will often say, well, if
people want to kill each other,

00:34:30.355 --> 00:34:31.590
they're going to find a way.

00:34:31.590 --> 00:34:34.300
And they will cite
different wars

00:34:34.300 --> 00:34:36.294
around the world in
which machetes were used

00:34:36.294 --> 00:34:39.810
and other things to slaughter
hundreds of thousands

00:34:39.810 --> 00:34:40.320
of people.

00:34:40.320 --> 00:34:42.489
But the truth is that in
almost every instance,

00:34:42.489 --> 00:34:45.560
it's having access to those
small weapons that in fact also

00:34:45.560 --> 00:34:48.040
facilitated that
particular slaughter.

00:34:48.040 --> 00:34:50.130
Because usually,
it's people with arms

00:34:50.130 --> 00:34:52.469
that are able to then
move the populations

00:34:52.469 --> 00:34:54.540
or control or prevent
anybody who is trying

00:34:54.540 --> 00:34:55.820
to stop that from happening.

00:34:55.820 --> 00:34:57.560
So the two often
go hand in hand.

00:34:57.560 --> 00:34:58.690
ADAM GREEN: And the case
for making it easier

00:34:58.690 --> 00:34:59.900
isn't a good idea, right?

00:34:59.900 --> 00:35:00.320
SAMANTHA NUTT: No.

00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:00.740
No.

00:35:00.740 --> 00:35:00.920
Exactly.

00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:01.790
ADAM GREEN: They
might find a way,

00:35:01.790 --> 00:35:03.690
but there's not
a lot of kids who

00:35:03.690 --> 00:35:05.904
get like killed by
stray strangling.

00:35:05.904 --> 00:35:07.320
SAMANTHA NUTT:
Well, that's right.

00:35:07.320 --> 00:35:07.890
ADAM GREEN: That's not a thing.

00:35:07.890 --> 00:35:09.056
SAMANTHA NUTT: That's right.

00:35:09.056 --> 00:35:11.900
And you have a
much better chance

00:35:11.900 --> 00:35:15.820
of being able to
stop that person.

00:35:15.820 --> 00:35:18.660
The more automatic that
weapon is, the more violent

00:35:18.660 --> 00:35:20.714
that weapon is, the
greater the destruction.

00:35:20.714 --> 00:35:21.630
ADAM GREEN: Excellent.

00:35:21.630 --> 00:35:25.709
Any other audience questions
or Dory questions, Vera?

00:35:25.709 --> 00:35:28.250
AUDIENCE: So here at Google, we
have employee resource groups

00:35:28.250 --> 00:35:31.460
of which the largest
is Women at Google.

00:35:31.460 --> 00:35:35.310
There's a pretty strong chapter
in our office led by Margo here

00:35:35.310 --> 00:35:38.250
and Nancy sitting
right next to her.

00:35:38.250 --> 00:35:40.430
So the first time
that I saw you speak

00:35:40.430 --> 00:35:43.480
was at the WXN
summit in November.

00:35:43.480 --> 00:35:46.080
You were the keynote at
the awards gala that night.

00:35:46.080 --> 00:35:48.760
And we were all just like
in love with you after that.

00:35:48.760 --> 00:35:51.540
We thought you had a
lot of great perspective

00:35:51.540 --> 00:35:52.390
on life in general.

00:35:52.390 --> 00:35:54.015
And what I loved
about the way that you

00:35:54.015 --> 00:35:57.210
spoke was that it was not,
oh, I'm speaking to the girls.

00:35:57.210 --> 00:35:58.430
This is like among us girls.

00:35:58.430 --> 00:36:01.360
You just had a great
perspective in life in general.

00:36:01.360 --> 00:36:04.160
That being said, I think you
had a lot to say about what it's

00:36:04.160 --> 00:36:06.470
like being in your role,
and going through your life

00:36:06.470 --> 00:36:08.939
being you, being a woman and
having some of the barriers

00:36:08.939 --> 00:36:09.480
that you did.

00:36:09.480 --> 00:36:12.130
So I'd love if you could kind of
talk about that for this group.

00:36:12.130 --> 00:36:12.620
SAMANTHA NUTT: Well, thank you.

00:36:12.620 --> 00:36:13.911
And it's nice to see you again.

00:36:13.911 --> 00:36:15.632
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:36:15.632 --> 00:36:18.090
SAMANTHA NUTT: Look, there's
no question that being a woman

00:36:18.090 --> 00:36:19.465
and doing this
kind of work comes

00:36:19.465 --> 00:36:22.150
with its own set of challenges.

00:36:22.150 --> 00:36:23.830
We're in environments
around the world

00:36:23.830 --> 00:36:27.110
where there's a tremendous
amount of sexual violence,

00:36:27.110 --> 00:36:29.700
huge amount of harassment--
I mean, I've personally

00:36:29.700 --> 00:36:34.730
experienced a great deal
of that myself-- and risk,

00:36:34.730 --> 00:36:37.470
and then trying to
juggle everything.

00:36:37.470 --> 00:36:38.740
I never use the word balance.

00:36:38.740 --> 00:36:40.710
Balance for me is
always such a cliche.

00:36:40.710 --> 00:36:43.880
Because I, without exaggeration,
wake up every day and deal

00:36:43.880 --> 00:36:44.750
with what's on fire.

00:36:44.750 --> 00:36:46.730
And if I can put
out those fires,

00:36:46.730 --> 00:36:49.590
that is a banner day for me.

00:36:49.590 --> 00:36:51.380
So balance, I
think, is something

00:36:51.380 --> 00:36:54.499
that is sort of a mythology.

00:36:54.499 --> 00:36:56.290
You find balance where
you find leprechauns

00:36:56.290 --> 00:36:57.955
and rainbow-colored unicorns.

00:36:57.955 --> 00:37:00.296
ADAM GREEN: Sounds
like a fabulous place.

00:37:00.296 --> 00:37:01.920
SAMANTHA NUTT: But
you know, so that it

00:37:01.920 --> 00:37:03.640
does come with certain risks.

00:37:03.640 --> 00:37:08.800
And for me, the only way
that I have discovered

00:37:08.800 --> 00:37:11.310
to contend with that is
just to stare them down,

00:37:11.310 --> 00:37:14.570
to get back up, and
to get back in there

00:37:14.570 --> 00:37:18.240
and to persevere, to defy.

00:37:18.240 --> 00:37:21.620
And I've been doing
that my entire life.

00:37:21.620 --> 00:37:24.290
And you get that, as
a girl, from the time

00:37:24.290 --> 00:37:25.712
that you're this big.

00:37:25.712 --> 00:37:26.920
Girls can't play in the park.

00:37:26.920 --> 00:37:27.753
Girls can't do this.

00:37:27.753 --> 00:37:28.667
Girls can't do that.

00:37:28.667 --> 00:37:30.000
Well, girls can do those things.

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:31.610
And girls are
doing those things.

00:37:31.610 --> 00:37:35.470
And we're going to show you
that we can do them better.

00:37:35.470 --> 00:37:38.750
And that's the message that I
try to convey to young women

00:37:38.750 --> 00:37:41.830
all the time, which
is to speak up,

00:37:41.830 --> 00:37:48.740
to speak out, to be undaunted,
to don't seek permissions.

00:37:48.740 --> 00:37:50.310
In my opinion,
permissions are only

00:37:50.310 --> 00:37:53.110
sought by those who
lack imagination.

00:37:53.110 --> 00:37:57.800
And don't be afraid to screw up.

00:37:57.800 --> 00:38:00.410
And don't worry so much about
whether people like you.

00:38:00.410 --> 00:38:03.160
I'm sure there's an entire
fleet of people out there

00:38:03.160 --> 00:38:04.970
who can't stand me.

00:38:04.970 --> 00:38:07.330
And I know there is
because, in fact, I

00:38:07.330 --> 00:38:10.570
hear from them on Twitter
quite often, especially

00:38:10.570 --> 00:38:11.920
some of those NRA folks.

00:38:11.920 --> 00:38:14.010
They love me.

00:38:14.010 --> 00:38:20.020
And I think that if we
don't hear enough, really,

00:38:20.020 --> 00:38:22.980
women's voices.

00:38:22.980 --> 00:38:24.920
And we don't role model
enough, and we don't

00:38:24.920 --> 00:38:27.840
mentor that enough, I think.

00:38:27.840 --> 00:38:29.490
And so for all of
you here as women

00:38:29.490 --> 00:38:31.170
who are in the tech
industry, I think

00:38:31.170 --> 00:38:35.180
it's really incumbent on
you, too, to be out there

00:38:35.180 --> 00:38:37.490
and to be talking
about your experiences

00:38:37.490 --> 00:38:40.370
and to be getting other
young women involved,

00:38:40.370 --> 00:38:42.600
and to be defying
those stereotypes.

00:38:42.600 --> 00:38:45.664
Because when I first
started in this work,

00:38:45.664 --> 00:38:48.080
there were hardly any women
going in and out of war zones.

00:38:48.080 --> 00:38:49.630
There were hardly
any-- you know,

00:38:49.630 --> 00:38:53.500
war was always seen as
traditionally a male domain.

00:38:53.500 --> 00:38:56.260
And now, I'm astonished every
time I walk into the office,

00:38:56.260 --> 00:38:59.840
and we have so many more women
in our office than we do men.

00:38:59.840 --> 00:39:04.070
And they're definitely the
visible minority in our office.

00:39:04.070 --> 00:39:06.399
And that's great.

00:39:06.399 --> 00:39:07.940
That is great,
especially when you're

00:39:07.940 --> 00:39:10.670
talking about working with
civilians in war zones,

00:39:10.670 --> 00:39:16.510
that usually, the ones who
are most impacted by war

00:39:16.510 --> 00:39:19.320
are civilians, primarily
women and children.

00:39:19.320 --> 00:39:22.470
So having women on the front
lines of those conversations

00:39:22.470 --> 00:39:26.810
trying to do something about
it is critical to our success

00:39:26.810 --> 00:39:28.630
and to eventually
eradicating the problem.

00:39:32.810 --> 00:39:34.620
ADAM GREEN: In your
book in the intro,

00:39:34.620 --> 00:39:36.880
you mentioned that
you don't think

00:39:36.880 --> 00:39:40.770
that war is a part of
the human condition

00:39:40.770 --> 00:39:42.150
and that there is hope.

00:39:42.150 --> 00:39:44.410
After reading it and
listening to your TED talk,

00:39:44.410 --> 00:39:47.570
I'm just struck by how
complicated these issues are.

00:39:47.570 --> 00:39:48.626
What keeps you hopeful?

00:39:52.380 --> 00:39:54.080
SAMANTHA NUTT: A
couple of things.

00:39:54.080 --> 00:39:56.540
But I would say I don't
fear that complexity.

00:39:56.540 --> 00:40:01.030
I think that part of it
is there aren't always

00:40:01.030 --> 00:40:04.010
easy fixes and easy answers.

00:40:04.010 --> 00:40:07.102
And we mislead people when we
pretend that that isn't true.

00:40:07.102 --> 00:40:09.060
ADAM GREEN: Despite what
campaign promises say.

00:40:09.060 --> 00:40:10.350
SAMANTHA NUTT: Despite
what campaign promises

00:40:10.350 --> 00:40:11.770
are out there, right?

00:40:11.770 --> 00:40:15.350
And I think that for all
of us, as we move forward,

00:40:15.350 --> 00:40:18.720
it is important to be more
sophisticated around what works

00:40:18.720 --> 00:40:19.710
and what doesn't work.

00:40:19.710 --> 00:40:22.440
And that it is complicated
and it's time for us

00:40:22.440 --> 00:40:23.600
to embrace that complexity.

00:40:23.600 --> 00:40:25.880
So I would say partly that.

00:40:25.880 --> 00:40:27.550
But for me,
ultimately what I find

00:40:27.550 --> 00:40:33.150
most hopeful is that every day
in War Child in our office,

00:40:33.150 --> 00:40:38.110
we are surrounded
by people who are

00:40:38.110 --> 00:40:44.310
a testament to what can
be done with compassion,

00:40:44.310 --> 00:40:48.880
and some ingenuity, and
concern, and a sense

00:40:48.880 --> 00:40:50.380
of strong global citizenship.

00:40:50.380 --> 00:40:54.280
We hear from people
who are in our programs

00:40:54.280 --> 00:40:56.380
where it really has
changed their lives.

00:40:56.380 --> 00:40:59.300
We hear from staff who
run those programs who

00:40:59.300 --> 00:41:03.750
helped build those programs
just how important our work is

00:41:03.750 --> 00:41:07.240
to their community, and
how respected they feel,

00:41:07.240 --> 00:41:11.210
and how engaged they
feel, and that ours

00:41:11.210 --> 00:41:14.847
is a true partnership-- that
we're not coming in and telling

00:41:14.847 --> 00:41:16.430
them what to do, but
we're asking them

00:41:16.430 --> 00:41:18.500
what they want to do.

00:41:18.500 --> 00:41:21.850
And that they feel
valued in the process.

00:41:21.850 --> 00:41:25.090
And so whenever I find
myself extremely frustrated,

00:41:25.090 --> 00:41:27.090
which is often-- and it's
never about the things

00:41:27.090 --> 00:41:27.900
that you would expect.

00:41:27.900 --> 00:41:29.300
We're dealing with
security situations

00:41:29.300 --> 00:41:30.966
all the time which
are very frustrating.

00:41:30.966 --> 00:41:33.370
But it's often seeing
a fantastic program

00:41:33.370 --> 00:41:35.210
like the one we have
in eastern Congo

00:41:35.210 --> 00:41:38.330
that survives on
fumes because it's

00:41:38.330 --> 00:41:41.150
so hard to mobilize public
interest for that war

00:41:41.150 --> 00:41:44.980
now that it's almost 20 years
old despite how devastating it

00:41:44.980 --> 00:41:45.680
has been.

00:41:45.680 --> 00:41:49.270
That's the stuff that
keeps me up at night.

00:41:49.270 --> 00:41:51.380
But I get up, and I
pushed through that sense

00:41:51.380 --> 00:41:56.710
of cynicism and frustration
because people depend on us.

00:41:56.710 --> 00:42:00.260
And it always has seemed
very self-indulgent to me

00:42:00.260 --> 00:42:02.610
to say, oh, this
work is exhausting.

00:42:02.610 --> 00:42:03.770
I want to do it anymore.

00:42:03.770 --> 00:42:07.340
I mean, we've got people
around the world that get shot

00:42:07.340 --> 00:42:09.500
at on their way to
work, whose children

00:42:09.500 --> 00:42:12.730
can't go more than two blocks
because they'll be raped.

00:42:12.730 --> 00:42:17.270
In South Sudan where all of
our staff and program partners

00:42:17.270 --> 00:42:19.584
had to flee to
the refugee camps.

00:42:19.584 --> 00:42:22.000
And within two days of them
arriving at the refugee camps,

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:23.330
they said, we're
going to keep going.

00:42:23.330 --> 00:42:24.480
And we went, well,
hang on a second.

00:42:24.480 --> 00:42:26.130
We're still trying to figure
out where the stuff is.

00:42:26.130 --> 00:42:27.790
The whole office has
been burned and torched.

00:42:27.790 --> 00:42:28.530
They're like, no, no.

00:42:28.530 --> 00:42:29.155
We're here now.

00:42:29.155 --> 00:42:30.720
We're good to go.

00:42:30.720 --> 00:42:34.510
And that is extraordinary.

00:42:34.510 --> 00:42:39.090
And it's breathtaking
when you experience it.

00:42:39.090 --> 00:42:44.850
And you know, it makes
me really hopeful.

00:42:44.850 --> 00:42:46.480
And that's why I
get up every day.

00:42:46.480 --> 00:42:49.280
ADAM GREEN: That's fantastic.

00:42:49.280 --> 00:42:51.566
Vera, how are we doing for time?

00:42:51.566 --> 00:42:54.530
VERA: [INAUDIBLE].

00:42:54.530 --> 00:42:55.930
ADAM GREEN: OK, excellent.

00:42:55.930 --> 00:43:00.490
So in that case, I'm
going to leave it on that.

00:43:00.490 --> 00:43:06.160
Everyone here, I encourage
you to take Samantha's request

00:43:06.160 --> 00:43:06.700
seriously.

00:43:06.700 --> 00:43:09.990
We have a donation
matching program at Google.

00:43:09.990 --> 00:43:13.470
You can set it up so that
part of every single paycheck

00:43:13.470 --> 00:43:17.329
goes to an organization like War
Child to help in conflict zones

00:43:17.329 --> 00:43:18.870
that people may have
forgotten about,

00:43:18.870 --> 00:43:22.320
that they're no longer
in the headlines.

00:43:22.320 --> 00:43:23.800
Write those strongly
worded letters

00:43:23.800 --> 00:43:25.860
to your members of parliament.

00:43:25.860 --> 00:43:27.240
Try to make that difference.

00:43:27.240 --> 00:43:31.800
And we have some books,
I think, at the back--

00:43:31.800 --> 00:43:34.350
"Damned Nation" is
a fantastic read.

00:43:34.350 --> 00:43:38.447
And definitely check out the
TED Talk as well on ted.com.

00:43:38.447 --> 00:43:39.780
SAMANTHA NUTT: Thanks, everyone.

00:43:39.780 --> 00:43:40.230
ADAM GREEN: Thank you.

00:43:40.730 --> 00:43:42.680
[APPLAUSE]
