00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:05.270
 Of the 7 billion people on Earth, nearly 6 billion have smart phones and this is strange 

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:10.690
 Considering that 4.5 billion people do not have toilets, why? 

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:13.070
 Smart machines make a change on your body and your mind? 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:17.470
 If you look down at your phone, the back of your spine is almost like you're carrying 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:21.900
 A child at the age of eight years on your neck in what is considered to be a lot taking into account 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.410
 Most people spend an average of 4.7 hours on their phones and integrate it 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:31.590
 With the length of time that the computer leads to the spread 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:37.329
 Myopia in North America. In the 1970s, a quarter of the population was infected 

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:43.390
 In short-sightedness, but in the present time almost half of the population are infected, but in some areas of Asia about 80 to 90 percent of the population 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:45.020
 Short-sighted 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:49.239
 It's hard to put a phone away - take for example the Candy Crash game 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:53.210
 Whenever you play, achieve small targets, which causes the brain to reward you 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:58.570
 A quantity of dopamine - and each time rewarded with new content. And this content too 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:03.100
 Gives you a small amount of dopamine and together this establishes the so-called "loop coercion" 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.600
 And by chance are the same episode responsible for behaviors associated with nicotine 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.909
 Or cocaine. The brain is designed to look for creativity, and for this reason existing applications 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:17.110
 Our phones are designed to give us new products, making it difficult for us to leave them 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:23.350
 As a result, 93% of people between 18 and 29 years old told us they were using their phones as a tool 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:28.110
 Avoid boredom, unlike other activities such as reading books or dealing with people around them. 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.950
 Which led to the emergence of a new term "numophobia" of fear or anxiety 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:34.560
 Without smart phones. 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.790
 We also see a change in the pattern of the brain: alpha rhythms are usually associated with "relaxation relaxation" 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:44.119
 Such as when touring your mind, while gamma waves are associated with 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:48.590
 Conscious attention. The tests showed that when the phone transmits 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:53.689
 - For example when the phone rings - the strength of these waves is greatly enhanced, which means 

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:57.829
 The processes that occur "waves" can literally change brain functions 

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:01.820
 Your smartphone can also change or destroy the sleep schedule. The screen emits a blue beam which shows 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:06.689
 Change our daily rhythm, making sleep less deep during the sleep period and associated with it 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:11.290
 Diabetes, cancer and obesity. Studies showed people who 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:15.980
 They use their phones at night and find it very difficult to sleep and produce a small amount of melatonin 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.849
 - The hormone responsible for the organization of sleep - vigilance rings. Harvard Medical School 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:26.610
 During the last 2 - 3 hours of sleep, you should be free of technologia, so read a book before bedtime. 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:31.569
 Of course, smart phones have completely changed our way of getting information and noticeably 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:36.980
 In the minority range and poverty in peoples, 7% of Americans rely heavily on smartphones 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:42.180
 Login online. In 2014 a study showed that the majority of owners of smart phones 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:47.180
 They use their phones for banking, searching for medical information and looking for jobs 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:51.590
 Since all smartphones are not bad, they were part of a positive change 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.890
 In the world, there is no doubt that it changed us 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:59.349
