00:00:07.347 --> 00:00:08.582
You can think of your cells

00:00:08.582 --> 00:00:10.816
as the kitchen in a busy restaurant.

00:00:10.816 --> 00:00:13.133
Sometimes your body orders chicken.

00:00:13.133 --> 00:00:15.215
Other times, it orders steak.

00:00:15.215 --> 00:00:17.093
Your cells have to be able to crank out

00:00:17.093 --> 00:00:18.559
whatever the body needs

00:00:18.559 --> 00:00:19.708
and quickly.

00:00:19.708 --> 00:00:20.938
When an order comes in,

00:00:20.938 --> 00:00:23.391
the chef looks to the cookbook, your DNA,

00:00:23.391 --> 00:00:24.771
for the recipe.

00:00:24.771 --> 00:00:26.154
She then transcribes that message

00:00:26.154 --> 00:00:28.650
onto a piece of paper called RNA

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.691
and brings it back to her countertop, the ribosome.

00:00:31.691 --> 00:00:34.725
There, she can translate the recipe into a meal,

00:00:34.725 --> 00:00:36.940
or for your cells, a protein,

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:39.736
by following the directions that she's copied down.

00:00:39.736 --> 00:00:41.295
But RNA does more for the cell

00:00:41.295 --> 00:00:42.642
than just act as a messenger

00:00:42.642 --> 00:00:44.567
between a cook and her cookbook.

00:00:44.567 --> 00:00:47.065
It can move in reverse and create DNA,

00:00:47.065 --> 00:00:49.796
it can direct amino acids to their targets,

00:00:49.796 --> 00:00:52.756
or it can take part in RNA interference,

00:00:52.756 --> 00:00:54.424
or RNAi.

00:00:54.424 --> 00:00:55.207
But wait!

00:00:55.207 --> 00:00:57.735
Why would RNA want to interfere with itself?

00:00:57.735 --> 00:01:00.270
Well, sometimes a cell doesn't want to turn

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.502
all of the messenger RNA it creates into protein,

00:01:03.502 --> 00:01:06.646
or it may need to destroy RNA injected into the cell

00:01:06.646 --> 00:01:08.513
by an attacking virus.

00:01:08.513 --> 00:01:10.976
Say, for example, in our cellular kitchen,

00:01:10.976 --> 00:01:12.926
that someone wanted to cancel their order

00:01:12.926 --> 00:01:15.807
or decided they wanted chips instead of fries.

00:01:15.807 --> 00:01:18.190
That's where RNAi comes in.

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:19.980
Thankfully, your cells have the perfect knives

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:21.785
for just this kind of job.

00:01:21.785 --> 00:01:23.295
When the cell finds or produces

00:01:23.295 --> 00:01:25.700
long, double-stranded RNA molecules,

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.199
it chops these molecules up

00:01:27.199 --> 00:01:30.311
with a protein actually named dicer.

00:01:30.311 --> 00:01:31.994
Now, these short snippets of RNA

00:01:31.994 --> 00:01:33.654
are floating around in the cell,

00:01:33.654 --> 00:01:35.837
and they're picked up by something called RISC,

00:01:35.837 --> 00:01:38.576
the RNA Silencing Complex.

00:01:38.576 --> 00:01:40.575
It's composed of a few different proteins,

00:01:40.575 --> 00:01:42.900
the most important being slicer.

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:44.846
This is another aptly named protein,

00:01:44.846 --> 00:01:47.264
and we'll get to why in just a second.

00:01:47.264 --> 00:01:48.875
RISC strips these small chunks

00:01:48.875 --> 00:01:50.817
of double-stranded RNA in half,

00:01:50.817 --> 00:01:54.021
using the single strand to target matching mRNA,

00:01:54.021 --> 00:01:55.448
looking for pieces that fit together

00:01:55.448 --> 00:01:57.691
like two halves of a sandwich.

00:01:57.691 --> 00:01:59.990
When it finds the matching piece of mRNA,

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:02.983
RISC's slicer protein slices it up.

00:02:02.983 --> 00:02:03.975
The cell then realizes

00:02:03.975 --> 00:02:06.068
there are odd, strangely sized pieces

00:02:06.068 --> 00:02:07.209
of RNA floating around

00:02:07.209 --> 00:02:08.550
and destroys them,

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.645
preventing the mRNA from being turned into protein.

00:02:11.645 --> 00:02:13.577
So, you have double-stranded RNA,

00:02:13.577 --> 00:02:14.747
you dice it up,

00:02:14.747 --> 00:02:16.230
it targets mRNA,

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.626
and then that gets sliced up, too.

00:02:18.626 --> 00:02:19.497
Voila!

00:02:19.497 --> 00:02:20.652
You've prevented expression

00:02:20.652 --> 00:02:23.313
and saved yourself some unhappy diners.

00:02:23.313 --> 00:02:26.555
So, how did anybody ever figure this out?

00:02:26.555 --> 00:02:29.853
Well, the process was first discovered in petunias

00:02:29.853 --> 00:02:32.463
when botanists trying to create deep purple blooms

00:02:32.463 --> 00:02:35.790
introduced a pigment-producing gene into the flowers.

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.319
But instead of darker flowers,

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:38.946
they found flowers with white patches

00:02:38.946 --> 00:02:40.558
and no pigment at all.

00:02:40.558 --> 00:02:43.196
Instead of using the RNA produced by the new gene

00:02:43.196 --> 00:02:44.228
to create more pigment,

00:02:44.228 --> 00:02:45.909
the flowers were actually using it

00:02:45.909 --> 00:02:48.060
to knock down the pigment-producing pathway,

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:49.092
destroying RNA

00:02:49.092 --> 00:02:51.602
from the plant's original genes with RNAi,

00:02:51.602 --> 00:02:54.897
and leaving them with pigment-free white flowers.

00:02:54.897 --> 00:02:56.647
Scientists saw a similar phenomena

00:02:56.647 --> 00:02:58.828
in tiny worms called C. elegans,

00:02:58.828 --> 00:03:00.582
and once they figured out what was happening,

00:03:00.582 --> 00:03:02.365
they realized they could use RNAi

00:03:02.365 --> 00:03:03.922
to their advantage.

00:03:03.922 --> 00:03:05.078
Want to see what happens

00:03:05.078 --> 00:03:06.849
when a certain gene is knocked out of a worm

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:07.990
or a fly?

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:10.426
Introduce an RNAi construct for that gene,

00:03:10.426 --> 00:03:11.170
and bam!

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:12.891
No more protein expression.

00:03:12.891 --> 00:03:14.520
You can even get creative

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:16.820
and target that effect to certain systems,

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:18.140
knocking down genes in just the brain,

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:19.171
or just the liver,

00:03:19.171 --> 00:03:20.528
or just the heart.

00:03:20.528 --> 00:03:21.587
Figuring out what happens

00:03:21.587 --> 00:03:23.845
when you knock down a gene in a certain system

00:03:23.845 --> 00:03:25.413
can be an important step

00:03:25.413 --> 00:03:28.084
in figuring out what that gene does.

00:03:28.084 --> 00:03:30.336
But RNAi isn't just for understanding

00:03:30.336 --> 00:03:31.866
how things happen.

00:03:31.866 --> 00:03:34.172
It can also be a powerful, therapeutic tool

00:03:34.172 --> 00:03:36.042
and could be a way for us to manipulate

00:03:36.042 --> 00:03:38.343
what is happening within own cells.

00:03:38.343 --> 00:03:39.751
Researchers have been experimenting

00:03:39.751 --> 00:03:41.916
with using it to their advantage in medicine,

00:03:41.916 --> 00:03:43.914
including targeting RNA and tumor cells

00:03:43.914 --> 00:03:46.666
in the hopes of turning off cancer-causing genes.

00:03:46.666 --> 00:03:48.628
In theory, our cellular kitchens

00:03:48.628 --> 00:03:50.509
could serve up an order of cells,

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:52.207
hold the cancer.
