00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:08.809
Hey EskimoPieLoves324b21, how hireable do
you think you are?

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:10.530
Hey guys, Julia here for DNews

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.940
Once upon a time, in the early days of the
internet.

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:16.530
People used the platform to play around with
identity, you could be whoever you wanted

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:17.530
to be.

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:18.530
You could even be different people!

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:19.840
It was so much fun.

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:21.520
Sadly.. those days are gone.

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:25.400
According to researchers from the University
of Washington most people today say their

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.190
online persona and their offline self are
pretty similar.

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:31.220
There are a number of studies that show how
much first impressions matter.

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:35.829
One of the first things people see about us
online is our username or email address.

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:36.829
And man.

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:37.829
Does it matter.

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.350
Which means that how you present yourself
online, says a lot about you.

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.510
We concern ourselves so much with the big
parts of our online persona, like our profile

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.570
picture or our bio, yet a lot can be inferred
from something as small as an email address.

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:54.699
One study published in the Journal of Research
in Personality called “How extraverted is

00:00:54.699 --> 00:01:00.309
honey.bunny77@hotmail.de?” found that people
are actually pretty good at inferring personality

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:02.309
from email addresses.

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.150
Researchers looked at almost 600 e-mail addresses
of young adults.

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:09.400
They collected data from personality tests
that judged traits like neuroticism, openness,

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.680
agreeableness, conscientiousness, and narcissism
and extraversion.

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.980
The researchers then asked 100 other people
what their impressions of those people’s

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:17.980
personalities were.

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:21.820
They found that most people’s impressions
were pretty much the same based only on e-mail

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:22.910
address alone.

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:26.630
Which you know, personality psychology is
a little controversial, but the study at least

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:30.740
showed there are certain stereotypes at play
with email addresses and those stereotypes

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:32.530
affect how people see you.

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.030
Which matters a lot when you’re trying to
land a job.

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.030
One study published in the journal Cyberpsychology,
Behavior, and Social Networking found that

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.780
your email address makes a difference when
applying to jobs.

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:45.850
It kind of sounds like a no-duh thing, but
there actually hasn’t been a lot of empirical

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:47.430
evidence to back it up.

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.380
73 professional recruiters looked at fake
resumes, the resumes had a mix of things like

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:55.680
spelling errors, different typefaces and informal
and formal email addresses.

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.500
The recruiters judged the applicants on intelligence
and the 6 personality traits I mentioned earlier.

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.890
The study found that a less than professional
email address like luv_u_sanne@hotmail.com,

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.700
was just as hurtful as spelling mistakes.

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.379
Even which email service you use says a lot
about you.

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.519
It could indicate how “tech savvy” you
are.

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:15.900
Mailchimp did a survey that found that gmail
and hotmail users tend be used by the young

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.319
adults with a median age of 31.

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:21.790
Yeah I know Hotmail is so passe to us in the
States… but it’s still popular by young

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:23.090
people abroad.

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.249
Gmail users use Google Chrome and like tech
stuff.

00:02:26.249 --> 00:02:30.799
If you use a yahoo address you’re probably
around settling down age, like 34, you like

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:34.879
religion and maybe interested in recruitment
and staffing. (and you’re probably no fun

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:40.010
at parties) If your email ends in an AOL.com
or Comcast.com you might be in your mid 40s

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.889
and are interested in the finer things in
life like good food and gardening.

00:02:43.889 --> 00:02:47.389
So whether we like it or not, our email addresses
say a lot about us.

00:02:47.389 --> 00:02:49.099
So much science to learn, you guys!

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:51.819
So much I couldn’t possibly fit it all into
one episode.

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:55.569
Fortunately, we’ll have a chance to talk
MORE science on Thursday April 9 at 2 PM,

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:56.590
pacific 5 eastern.

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.431
That’s when we’re hanging out with Mitchell
Moffit and Greg Brown from ASAPScience and

00:03:00.431 --> 00:03:02.560
Joe Hanson from It's Okay to Be Smart!

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:26.049
RSVP with the link in the description because
you do not want to miss it.
