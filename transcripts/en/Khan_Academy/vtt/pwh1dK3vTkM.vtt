00:00:00.415 --> 00:00:02.706
- [Voiceover] The graph of
function f is given below.

00:00:02.706 --> 00:00:06.207
It has a vertical tangent at
the point three comma zero.

00:00:06.207 --> 00:00:09.853
Three comma zero has a vertical
tangent, let me draw that.

00:00:09.853 --> 00:00:13.429
It has a vertical
tangent right over there,

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:15.093
and a horizontal tangent at the point

00:00:15.093 --> 00:00:17.110
zero comma negative three.

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:18.540
Zero comma negative three,

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:23.189
so it has a horizontal
tangent right over there,

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.890
and also has a horizontal
tangent at six comma three.

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:29.261
Six comma three, let me draw

00:00:29.261 --> 00:00:32.511
the horizontal tangent, just like that.

00:00:33.931 --> 00:00:38.632
Select all the x-values for
which f is not differentiable.

00:00:38.632 --> 00:00:41.056
Select all that apply.

00:00:41.056 --> 00:00:44.889
F prime, f prime, I'll
write it in short hand.

00:00:46.014 --> 00:00:47.931
We say no f prime under

00:00:49.257 --> 00:00:51.026
it's going to happen
under three conditions.

00:00:51.026 --> 00:00:52.217
The first condition you could say

00:00:52.217 --> 00:00:54.980
well we have a vertical tangent.

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:56.442
Vertical tangent.

00:00:56.442 --> 00:00:58.889
Why is a vertical tangent a place where

00:00:58.889 --> 00:01:00.738
it's hard to define our derivative?

00:01:00.738 --> 00:01:02.497
Well, remember, our derivative is

00:01:02.497 --> 00:01:04.805
we're really trying to find
our rate of change of y

00:01:04.805 --> 00:01:06.458
with respect to x,

00:01:06.458 --> 00:01:08.683
but when you have a vertical tangent,

00:01:08.683 --> 00:01:11.291
you change your x a very small amount,

00:01:11.291 --> 00:01:14.055
you have an infinite change in y,

00:01:14.055 --> 00:01:16.272
either in the positive or
the negative direction.

00:01:16.272 --> 00:01:19.667
That's one situation where
you have no derivative.

00:01:19.667 --> 00:01:21.971
They tell us where we have
a vertical tangent in here,

00:01:21.971 --> 00:01:23.618
where x is equal to three.

00:01:23.618 --> 00:01:24.785
We have no ...

00:01:26.151 --> 00:01:28.171
F is not differentiable at x equals three

00:01:28.171 --> 00:01:29.460
because of the vertical tangent.

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.247
You might say what about
horizontal tangents?

00:01:31.247 --> 00:01:33.005
No, horizontal tangents
are completely fine.

00:01:33.005 --> 00:01:35.478
Horizontal tangents are
places where the derivative

00:01:35.478 --> 00:01:36.625
is equal to zero.

00:01:36.625 --> 00:01:38.644
F prime of six is equal to zero.

00:01:38.644 --> 00:01:41.394
F prime of zero is equal to zero.

00:01:43.472 --> 00:01:45.176
What are other scenarios?

00:01:45.176 --> 00:01:47.176
Well another scenario
where you're not gonna have

00:01:47.176 --> 00:01:51.450
a defined derivative is where
the graph is not continuous.

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:52.700
Not continuous.

00:01:54.216 --> 00:01:57.952
We see right over here at
x equals negative three,

00:01:57.952 --> 00:02:00.285
our graph is not continuous.

00:02:01.143 --> 00:02:03.610
X equals negative three
it's not continuous.

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:07.052
Those are thee only places
where f is not differentiable

00:02:07.052 --> 00:02:08.392
that they're giving us options on.

00:02:08.392 --> 00:02:09.915
We don't know what the graph is doing

00:02:09.915 --> 00:02:12.243
to the left or the right.

00:02:12.243 --> 00:02:14.802
These there I guess would
be interesting cases.

00:02:14.802 --> 00:02:17.737
They haven't given us those choices here.

00:02:17.737 --> 00:02:21.193
We already said, at x equals
0, the derivative is zero.

00:02:21.193 --> 00:02:22.026
It's defined.

00:02:22.026 --> 00:02:22.859
It's differentiable there.

00:02:22.859 --> 00:02:25.416
At x equals six, the derivative is zero.

00:02:25.416 --> 00:02:27.333
We have a flat tangent.

00:02:28.176 --> 00:02:30.299
Once again it's defined there as well.

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:32.924
Let's do another one of these.

00:02:32.924 --> 00:02:34.437
Actually, I didn't include, I think that

00:02:34.437 --> 00:02:36.103
this takes care of this problem,

00:02:36.103 --> 00:02:37.429
but there's a third scenario

00:02:37.429 --> 00:02:41.453
in which we have, I'll
call it a sharp turn.

00:02:41.453 --> 00:02:42.536
A sharp turn.

00:02:43.584 --> 00:02:46.629
This isn't the most mathy
definition right over here,

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:48.320
but it's easy to recognize.

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:49.880
A sharp turn is something like that,

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.995
or like, well no, that
doesn't look too sharp,

00:02:53.995 --> 00:02:55.078
or like this.

00:02:56.007 --> 00:02:58.512
The reason why where you
have these sharp bends

00:02:58.512 --> 00:03:00.045
or sharp turns as opposed to something

00:03:00.045 --> 00:03:02.065
that looks more smooth like that.

00:03:02.065 --> 00:03:04.146
The reason why we're not
differentiable there is

00:03:04.146 --> 00:03:06.273
as we approach this point,

00:03:06.273 --> 00:03:08.878
as we approach this
point from either side,

00:03:08.878 --> 00:03:10.112
we have different slopes.

00:03:10.112 --> 00:03:13.228
Notice our slope is
positive right over here,

00:03:13.228 --> 00:03:15.367
as x increases, y is increasing,

00:03:15.367 --> 00:03:16.897
While the slope is negative here.

00:03:16.897 --> 00:03:20.032
As you're trying to find
the limit of our slope

00:03:20.032 --> 00:03:21.188
as we approach this point,

00:03:21.188 --> 00:03:22.665
it's not going to exist
because it's different

00:03:22.665 --> 00:03:24.533
on the left hand side
and the right hand side.

00:03:24.533 --> 00:03:27.198
That's why the sharp turns, I
don't see any sharp turns here

00:03:27.198 --> 00:03:28.978
so it doesn't apply to this example.

00:03:28.978 --> 00:03:30.850
Let's do one more examples.

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:33.156
Actually this one does
have some sharp turns.

00:03:33.156 --> 00:03:35.412
This could be interesting.

00:03:35.412 --> 00:03:38.540
The graph of function f is
given to the left right here.

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:41.747
It has a vertical asymptote
at x equals negative three,

00:03:41.747 --> 00:03:42.834
we see that,

00:03:42.834 --> 00:03:46.417
and horizontal asymptotes
at y equals zero.

00:03:47.776 --> 00:03:51.460
This end of the curve as x
approaches negative infinity

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:54.654
it looks like y is approaching zero.

00:03:54.654 --> 00:03:57.028
It has another horizontal
asymptote at y equals four.

00:03:57.028 --> 00:03:58.945
As x approaches infinity, it looks like

00:03:58.945 --> 00:04:02.530
our graph is trending down
to y is equal to four.

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:06.350
Select the x values for which
f is not differentiable.

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:10.517
First of all, we could think
about vertical tangents.

00:04:11.405 --> 00:04:13.173
Doesn't seem to have
any vertical tangents.

00:04:13.173 --> 00:04:15.491
Then we could think about
where we are not continuous.

00:04:15.491 --> 00:04:16.883
Well, we're definitely not continuous

00:04:16.883 --> 00:04:19.241
where we have this vertical
asymptote right over here.

00:04:19.241 --> 00:04:21.779
We're not continuous at
x equals negative three.

00:04:21.779 --> 00:04:25.195
We're also not continuous
at x is equal to one.

00:04:25.195 --> 00:04:27.612
Then the last situation where

00:04:28.735 --> 00:04:30.464
we are not going to be differentiable

00:04:30.464 --> 00:04:32.843
is where we have a sharp turn,

00:04:32.843 --> 00:04:36.433
or you could kind of view it
as a sharp point, on our graph.

00:04:36.433 --> 00:04:39.208
I see a sharp point right over there.

00:04:39.208 --> 00:04:41.302
Notice as we approach
from the left hand side,

00:04:41.302 --> 00:04:44.438
the slope looks like a
constant, I don't know,

00:04:44.438 --> 00:04:46.664
it's like a positive three halves,

00:04:46.664 --> 00:04:48.672
while as we go to the right side of that

00:04:48.672 --> 00:04:50.642
it looks like our slope turns negative.

00:04:50.642 --> 00:04:53.298
If you were to try to find
the limit of the slope

00:04:53.298 --> 00:04:54.915
as we approach from either side,

00:04:54.915 --> 00:04:56.041
which is essentially
what you're trying to do

00:04:56.041 --> 00:04:58.107
when you try to find the derivative,

00:04:58.107 --> 00:04:59.682
well it's not going to be defined

00:04:59.682 --> 00:05:02.909
because it's different from either side.

00:05:02.909 --> 00:05:06.367
F is also not differentiable
at the x value

00:05:06.367 --> 00:05:10.406
that gives us that little
sharp point right over there.

00:05:10.406 --> 00:05:11.896
If you were to graph the derivative,

00:05:11.896 --> 00:05:13.623
which we will do in future videos,

00:05:13.623 --> 00:05:15.706
you will see that the derivative is not

00:05:15.706 --> 00:05:17.261
continuous at that point.

00:05:17.261 --> 00:05:19.011
Let me mark that off.

00:05:20.045 --> 00:05:22.465
Then we can check x equals zero.

00:05:22.465 --> 00:05:24.077
X equals zero's completely cool.

00:05:24.077 --> 00:05:27.301
We're at a point that our tangent line

00:05:27.301 --> 00:05:28.951
is definitely not vertical.

00:05:28.951 --> 00:05:30.479
We're definitely continuous there.

00:05:30.479 --> 00:05:33.204
We definitely do not have
a sharp point or edge.

00:05:33.204 --> 00:05:36.704
We're completely cool at x equals zero.
