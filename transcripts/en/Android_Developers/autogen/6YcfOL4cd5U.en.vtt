you know we're going to be reviewing

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109
you know we're going to be reviewing
 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.260
you know we're going to be reviewing
these these video player apps and

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270
these these video player apps and
 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:19.880

the big deal is I mean I've had a look

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689
the big deal is I mean I've had a look
 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.500
the big deal is I mean I've had a look
at the code and as far as I can see this

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510
at the code and as far as I can see this
 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.120
at the code and as far as I can see this
is all we need to do right we just need

when we launched honeycomb we decided to

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970
when we launched honeycomb we decided to
 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:12.670
when we launched honeycomb we decided to
make some improvements and we supported

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680
make some improvements and we supported
 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.730
make some improvements and we supported
an API called openmax al now the truth

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:15.740
an API called openmax al now the truth
 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:18.370
an API called openmax al now the truth
is openmax al was not necessarily our

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380
is openmax al was not necessarily our
 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:21.700
is openmax al was not necessarily our
first choice because it's not a Java API

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:21.710
first choice because it's not a Java API
 

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:24.940
first choice because it's not a Java API
but it is a chrono standard much like

an Ice Cream Sandwich openmax al is a
 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.110
an Ice Cream Sandwich openmax al is a
great choice the drawback is you've got

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120
great choice the drawback is you've got
 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.840
great choice the drawback is you've got
to write your code in C hmm with Ice

Cream Sandwich we also introduced a new

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980
Cream Sandwich we also introduced a new

way of working with video and that was

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700
way of working with video and that was
 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.900
way of working with video and that was
the texture view and surface view so

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:49.910
the texture view and surface view so
 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:53.380
the texture view and surface view so
these the ability to actually work with

these the ability to actually work with
 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:56.740
these the ability to actually work with
video textures allowed you to do some

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750
video textures allowed you to do some
 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:58.480
video textures allowed you to do some
more interesting things like real-time

00:02:58.480 --> 00:02:58.490

make a media app and it what should it
 

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:22.860
make a media app and it what should it
be absolutely so uh let's have a look so

great video player app and I think we

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:30.580
great video player app and I think we

general categories I'm sure these are

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:34.570
general categories I'm sure these are
 

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:37.170
general categories I'm sure these are
the main two pieces of functionality

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:37.180
the main two pieces of functionality
 

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:39.800

look at it exactly so there's the two

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:11.500
look at it exactly so there's the two
 

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:13.050
look at it exactly so there's the two
categories of browsing and playback so

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:13.060
categories of browsing and playback so
 

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:15.450

discover the information that you've
 

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:20.129
discover the information that you've
already got on your device so if you've

00:06:20.129 --> 00:06:20.139
already got on your device so if you've
 

00:06:20.139 --> 00:06:21.629
already got on your device so if you've
got one or two videos then that should

00:06:21.629 --> 00:06:21.639
got one or two videos then that should
 

00:06:21.639 --> 00:06:23.370

be fairly straightforward but you've got

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:23.380

of apps trying to sort of half take our

00:08:34.670 --> 00:08:34.680
of apps trying to sort of half take our
 

00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:36.500
of apps trying to sort of half take our
advice here and say oh well people say

00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:36.510
advice here and say oh well people say
 

00:08:36.510 --> 00:08:38.120

00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:45.160
of course they weren't taking our advice
 

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:46.890
of course they weren't taking our advice
I mean these are features of these apps

00:08:46.890 --> 00:08:46.900
I mean these are features of these apps
 

00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:48.600
I mean these are features of these apps
it's not just a long time it's obvious

00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:48.610
it's not just a long time it's obvious
 

00:08:48.610 --> 00:08:51.690
it's not just a long time it's obvious
that people want to be able to see the

00:08:51.690 --> 00:08:51.700
that people want to be able to see the
 

00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:53.190
that people want to be able to see the
sorts of things that they see in a

00:08:53.190 --> 00:08:53.200
sorts of things that they see in a
 

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:54.870
sorts of things that they see in a
notification of our battery life and the

00:08:54.870 --> 00:08:54.880
notification of our battery life and the
 

00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:56.700
notification of our battery life and the
clock being two very important ones

00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:56.710
clock being two very important ones
 

00:08:56.710 --> 00:08:58.290
clock being two very important ones
absolutely but if you're going to show

00:08:58.290 --> 00:08:58.300
absolutely but if you're going to show
 

00:08:58.300 --> 00:09:01.080
absolutely but if you're going to show
that already why not just support all of

00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:01.090
that already why not just support all of
 

00:09:01.090 --> 00:09:03.090
that already why not just support all of
the use cases when I have a notification

00:09:03.090 --> 00:09:03.100
the use cases when I have a notification
 

00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:06.030
the use cases when I have a notification
I want to be able to pull it down I want

00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:06.040
I want to be able to pull it down I want

to know if if I need to stop watching my

00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:08.830
to know if if I need to stop watching my
 

00:09:08.830 --> 00:09:10.410
to know if if I need to stop watching my
video because there's an important

00:09:10.410 --> 00:09:10.420
video because there's an important
 

00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:11.670
video because there's an important
meeting that I completely forgot about

00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:11.680
meeting that I completely forgot about
 

00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:12.090
meeting that I completely forgot about
it

00:09:12.090 --> 00:09:12.100
it
 

00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:14.100
it
absolutely so let's have a look at the

00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:14.110
absolutely so let's have a look at the
 

00:09:14.110 --> 00:09:15.270
absolutely so let's have a look at the
apps which we're going to check out

00:09:15.270 --> 00:09:15.280
apps which we're going to check out
 

00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:17.580
apps which we're going to check out
today so the ill poor app developers for

00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:17.590
today so the ill poor app developers for
 

00:09:17.590 --> 00:09:19.440
today so the ill poor app developers for
these apps have been waiting for two or

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:19.450
these apps have been waiting for two or
 

00:09:19.450 --> 00:09:21.300
these apps have been waiting for two or
three weeks now for this feedback but

00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:21.310
three weeks now for this feedback but
 

00:09:21.310 --> 00:09:23.610
three weeks now for this feedback but
we're gonna be looking at MX player CNX

00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:23.620
we're gonna be looking at MX player CNX
 

00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:26.580
we're gonna be looking at MX player CNX
player and dice player so three video

00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:26.590
player and dice player so three video
 

00:09:26.590 --> 00:09:30.060
player and dice player so three video
playing apps there so let's get started

00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:30.070
playing apps there so let's get started
 

00:09:30.070 --> 00:09:31.560
playing apps there so let's get started
I guess let's let's kick off with it the

00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:31.570
I guess let's let's kick off with it the
 

00:09:31.570 --> 00:09:32.760
I guess let's let's kick off with it the
first step we wanted to look at was

00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:32.770
first step we wanted to look at was
 

00:09:32.770 --> 00:09:35.880
first step we wanted to look at was
Synnex player and as you can see we've

00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:35.890
Synnex player and as you can see we've
 

00:09:35.890 --> 00:09:38.070
Synnex player and as you can see we've
got the they've got a feature graphic

00:09:38.070 --> 00:09:38.080
got the they've got a feature graphic
 

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:40.920
got the they've got a feature graphic
which is really nice yeah and the

00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:40.930
which is really nice yeah and the
 

00:09:40.930 --> 00:09:45.480
which is really nice yeah and the
feature graphic here is nicely done but

00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:45.490
feature graphic here is nicely done but
 

00:09:45.490 --> 00:09:48.630
feature graphic here is nicely done but
I I wouldn't I wouldn't use this one

00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:48.640
I I wouldn't I wouldn't use this one
 

00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:51.120
I I wouldn't I wouldn't use this one
personally yeah I mean you can see we're

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:51.130
personally yeah I mean you can see we're
 

00:09:51.130 --> 00:09:52.860
personally yeah I mean you can see we're
looking at confidence monitors from a

00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:52.870
looking at confidence monitors from a
 

00:09:52.870 --> 00:09:54.720
looking at confidence monitors from a
fair distance away and you can't really

00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:54.730
fair distance away and you can't really
 

00:09:54.730 --> 00:09:56.880
fair distance away and you can't really
read the name of the app from here it

00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:56.890
read the name of the app from here it
 

00:09:56.890 --> 00:09:58.170
read the name of the app from here it
fades into the background the contrast

00:09:58.170 --> 00:09:58.180
fades into the background the contrast
 

00:09:58.180 --> 00:09:59.880
fades into the background the contrast
isn't really high enough and the words

00:09:59.880 --> 00:09:59.890
isn't really high enough and the words
 

00:09:59.890 --> 00:10:02.820
isn't really high enough and the words
are too small now all I see is X with

00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:02.830
are too small now all I see is X with
 

00:10:02.830 --> 00:10:05.490
are too small now all I see is X with
maybe an E and something that's either

00:10:05.490 --> 00:10:05.500
maybe an E and something that's either
 

00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:09.330
maybe an E and something that's either
an R or an X next to it yeah who can say

00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:09.340
an R or an X next to it yeah who can say
 

00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:11.400
an R or an X next to it yeah who can say
so that you know they've they've got the

00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:11.410
so that you know they've they've got the
 

00:10:11.410 --> 00:10:12.690
so that you know they've they've got the
table stakes here they've got the

00:10:12.690 --> 00:10:12.700
table stakes here they've got the

which is really important but they
 

00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:20.040
which is really important but they
haven't taken advantage of and we've

haven't taken advantage of and we've
seen just recently people blogging and

seen just recently people blogging and
 

00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:23.880
seen just recently people blogging and
talking about the fact that just having

00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:23.890
talking about the fact that just having
 

00:10:23.890 --> 00:10:25.800
talking about the fact that just having
a better feature graphic you can have a

00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:25.810
a better feature graphic you can have a
 

00:10:25.810 --> 00:10:27.540
a better feature graphic you can have a
significant impact on your downloads

promoted exactly I can guarantee that
for this one they wouldn't even run it

00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:33.310
for this one they wouldn't even run it
 

00:10:33.310 --> 00:10:34.920
for this one they wouldn't even run it
this would get kicked back to the

00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:34.930
this would get kicked back to the
 

00:10:34.930 --> 00:10:37.290

then so it does give you the ability to

00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:29.750
then so it does give you the ability to

then so it does give you the ability to
report which presumably will give them

00:13:31.210 --> 00:13:31.220
report which presumably will give them
 

00:13:31.220 --> 00:13:32.920
report which presumably will give them
the ability to get feedback on what

00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:32.930

can go back here and click on on this
 

00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:40.060
can go back here and click on on this
other video and have that playback right

it so it does have the time and it has
 

00:15:26.510 --> 00:15:28.090
it so it does have the time and it has
the battery life as well so it's trying

think you looked at in more detail but

00:20:44.820 --> 00:20:44.830
think you looked at in more detail but
 

00:20:44.830 --> 00:20:46.260
think you looked at in more detail but
I've in fact I used this one a little

I've moved into a different location in
 

00:21:29.860 --> 00:21:32.730
I've moved into a different location in
the hierarchy now once I had several

00:21:32.730 --> 00:21:32.740
the hierarchy now once I had several
 

00:21:32.740 --> 00:21:34.980
the hierarchy now once I had several
different folders and playlists and

00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:34.990
different folders and playlists and
 

00:21:34.990 --> 00:21:38.040
different folders and playlists and
alternate locations on my device I found

00:21:38.040 --> 00:21:38.050
alternate locations on my device I found
 

00:21:38.050 --> 00:21:41.550
alternate locations on my device I found
that to be sort of disorienting yeah

00:21:41.550 --> 00:21:41.560
that to be sort of disorienting yeah
 

00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:42.090
that to be sort of disorienting yeah

I didn't really like not knowing where I

00:21:44.430 --> 00:21:44.440
I didn't really like not knowing where I
 

00:21:44.440 --> 00:21:46.920
I didn't really like not knowing where I
was in the in the general hierarchy of

00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:46.930
was in the in the general hierarchy of
 

00:21:46.930 --> 00:21:49.350
was in the in the general hierarchy of
my device it might just be me well I

00:21:49.350 --> 00:21:49.360
my device it might just be me well I
 

00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:50.820
my device it might just be me well I
think it's it's an interesting point and

00:21:50.820 --> 00:21:50.830
think it's it's an interesting point and
 

00:21:50.830 --> 00:21:52.500
think it's it's an interesting point and
something consistent between all of

00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:52.510
something consistent between all of
 

00:21:52.510 --> 00:21:53.880
something consistent between all of
these apps which is that the browsing

00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:53.890
these apps which is that the browsing
 

00:21:53.890 --> 00:21:55.650
these apps which is that the browsing
experience doesn't seem optimised for

00:21:55.650 --> 00:21:55.660
experience doesn't seem optimised for
 

00:21:55.660 --> 00:21:58.320
experience doesn't seem optimised for
content discovery so I can see

00:21:58.320 --> 00:21:58.330
content discovery so I can see
 

00:21:58.330 --> 00:21:59.759
content discovery so I can see
these apps have probably come from is

00:21:59.759 --> 00:21:59.769
these apps have probably come from is
 

00:21:59.769 --> 00:22:01.470
these apps have probably come from is
people who have this content and they

00:22:01.470 --> 00:22:01.480
people who have this content and they
 

00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:03.419
people who have this content and they
wanted to view it on their tablets the

00:22:03.419 --> 00:22:03.429
wanted to view it on their tablets the
 

00:22:03.429 --> 00:22:05.100
wanted to view it on their tablets the
native media played and do the job and

00:22:05.100 --> 00:22:05.110
native media played and do the job and
 

00:22:05.110 --> 00:22:07.649
native media played and do the job and
so they've built apps to do that so

00:22:07.649 --> 00:22:07.659
so they've built apps to do that so
 

00:22:07.659 --> 00:22:08.880
so they've built apps to do that so
knowing what's on there and having it

00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:08.890
knowing what's on there and having it
 

00:22:08.890 --> 00:22:10.350
knowing what's on there and having it
already in a directory structure and you

00:22:10.350 --> 00:22:10.360
already in a directory structure and you
 

00:22:10.360 --> 00:22:11.940
already in a directory structure and you
know all chances is probably going to be

00:22:11.940 --> 00:22:11.950
know all chances is probably going to be
 

00:22:11.950 --> 00:22:13.799
know all chances is probably going to be
enough for them to understand but as

00:22:13.799 --> 00:22:13.809
enough for them to understand but as
 

00:22:13.809 --> 00:22:15.480
enough for them to understand but as
you're trying to build something for

00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:15.490
you're trying to build something for
 

00:22:15.490 --> 00:22:17.009
you're trying to build something for
more people to use who didn't build the

00:22:17.009 --> 00:22:17.019
more people to use who didn't build the
 

00:22:17.019 --> 00:22:18.299
more people to use who didn't build the
app you really need to make things like

00:22:18.299 --> 00:22:18.309
app you really need to make things like
 

00:22:18.309 --> 00:22:20.399
app you really need to make things like
navigation much more prominent so people

00:22:20.399 --> 00:22:20.409
navigation much more prominent so people
 

00:22:20.409 --> 00:22:21.960
navigation much more prominent so people
who didn't design the app still

00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:21.970
who didn't design the app still
 

00:22:21.970 --> 00:22:24.360
who didn't design the app still
understand how it was I feel like the in

at the same time as we set that flag

00:29:20.180 --> 00:29:20.190
at the same time as we set that flag
 

00:29:20.190 --> 00:29:21.980
at the same time as we set that flag
we're also going to set a listener which

00:29:21.980 --> 00:29:21.990
we're also going to set a listener which
 

00:29:21.990 --> 00:29:24.470
we're also going to set a listener which
is going to set the UI flag either

00:29:24.470 --> 00:29:24.480
is going to set the UI flag either
 

00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:25.850
is going to set the UI flag either
visible or fullscreen so that's going to

00:29:25.850 --> 00:29:25.860
visible or fullscreen so that's going to

devices it's a little bit different we

00:29:39.140 --> 00:29:39.150
devices it's a little bit different we
 

00:29:39.150 --> 00:29:42.560
devices it's a little bit different we
have we have the ability to hide the

00:29:42.560 --> 00:29:42.570
have we have the ability to hide the
 

00:29:42.570 --> 00:29:44.899
have we have the ability to hide the
status bar and we also have the ability

00:29:44.899 --> 00:29:44.909
status bar and we also have the ability
 

00:29:44.909 --> 00:29:47.899

to go into what's kind of a low a low

00:29:47.899 --> 00:29:47.909
to go into what's kind of a low a low
 

00:29:47.909 --> 00:29:50.000
to go into what's kind of a low a low
profile mode and so this is going to

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:50.010
profile mode and so this is going to
 

00:29:50.010 --> 00:29:52.520

00:29:59.149 --> 00:29:59.159
honeycomb devices be those three little
 

00:29:59.159 --> 00:30:02.060
honeycomb devices be those three little
dots so it hides as much as a can but

00:30:02.060 --> 00:30:02.070
dots so it hides as much as a can but
 

00:30:02.070 --> 00:30:03.080
dots so it hides as much as a can but
doesn't actually give you any extra

00:30:03.080 --> 00:30:03.090
doesn't actually give you any extra
 

00:30:03.090 --> 00:30:04.700
doesn't actually give you any extra
screen real estate right this is what we

00:30:04.700 --> 00:30:04.710
screen real estate right this is what we
 

00:30:04.710 --> 00:30:06.409
screen real estate right this is what we
used to call lights-out mode exactly

00:30:06.409 --> 00:30:06.419
used to call lights-out mode exactly
 

00:30:06.419 --> 00:30:08.180
used to call lights-out mode exactly
like that mode so that's kind of your

00:30:08.180 --> 00:30:08.190
like that mode so that's kind of your
 

00:30:08.190 --> 00:30:10.520

next best for sort of fear honeycomb

00:30:10.520 --> 00:30:10.530
next best for sort of fear honeycomb
 

00:30:10.530 --> 00:30:13.340
next best for sort of fear honeycomb
IRRI devices if you go back one step

00:30:13.340 --> 00:30:13.350
IRRI devices if you go back one step
 

00:30:13.350 --> 00:30:16.010
IRRI devices if you go back one step
further before we had tablet devices and

00:30:16.010 --> 00:30:16.020
further before we had tablet devices and
 

00:30:16.020 --> 00:30:17.480
further before we had tablet devices and
the only Chrome that you had on the

00:30:17.480 --> 00:30:17.490
the only Chrome that you had on the
 

00:30:17.490 --> 00:30:20.330
the only Chrome that you had on the
screen at all was the status bar the way

00:30:20.330 --> 00:30:20.340
screen at all was the status bar the way
 

00:30:20.340 --> 00:30:22.850
screen at all was the status bar the way
to do that was to flag fullscreen you

00:30:22.850 --> 00:30:22.860
to do that was to flag fullscreen you
 

00:30:22.860 --> 00:30:24.409
to do that was to flag fullscreen you
know set the window layout parameters to

00:30:24.409 --> 00:30:24.419
know set the window layout parameters to
 

00:30:24.419 --> 00:30:26.330
know set the window layout parameters to
flag fullscreen and that will remove

00:30:26.330 --> 00:30:26.340
flag fullscreen and that will remove
 

00:30:26.340 --> 00:30:28.880
flag fullscreen and that will remove
your notification bar and this is

00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:28.890
your notification bar and this is
 

00:30:28.890 --> 00:30:31.580
your notification bar and this is
something which is only appropriate to

00:30:31.580 --> 00:30:31.590
something which is only appropriate to
 

00:30:31.590 --> 00:30:33.200
something which is only appropriate to
do in a very specific circumstances and

00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:33.210
do in a very specific circumstances and
 

00:30:33.210 --> 00:30:34.700
do in a very specific circumstances and
playing back video is one of those

00:30:34.700 --> 00:30:34.710
playing back video is one of those
 

00:30:34.710 --> 00:30:36.830
playing back video is one of those
circumstances and the important thing to

00:30:36.830 --> 00:30:36.840
circumstances and the important thing to
 

00:30:36.840 --> 00:30:39.049
circumstances and the important thing to
note here for pre honeycomb devices is

00:30:39.049 --> 00:30:39.059
note here for pre honeycomb devices is
 

00:30:39.059 --> 00:30:41.539
note here for pre honeycomb devices is
that you have to manually add it and

00:30:41.539 --> 00:30:41.549
that you have to manually add it and
 

00:30:41.549 --> 00:30:43.190
that you have to manually add it and
remove it and so one of the temptations

00:30:43.190 --> 00:30:43.200
remove it and so one of the temptations
 

00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:44.450
remove it and so one of the temptations
that I've seen a lot of apps do is they

00:30:44.450 --> 00:30:44.460
that I've seen a lot of apps do is they
 

00:30:44.460 --> 00:30:46.340
that I've seen a lot of apps do is they
simply remove it and you never get it

00:30:46.340 --> 00:30:46.350
simply remove it and you never get it
 

00:30:46.350 --> 00:30:48.140
simply remove it and you never get it

infuriating so what you actually want to
do here is tie this code into play and

00:30:55.180 --> 00:30:55.190

00:31:12.340 --> 00:31:12.350
this doesn't have a feature graphic so
 

00:31:12.350 --> 00:31:13.660
this doesn't have a feature graphic so
it doesn't have the table stakes to be

00:31:13.660 --> 00:31:13.670
it doesn't have the table stakes to be
 

00:31:13.670 --> 00:31:15.670
it doesn't have the table stakes to be
featured even if we wanted to which is

00:31:15.670 --> 00:31:15.680
featured even if we wanted to which is
 

00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:17.230

what this actually took us to is a

00:33:02.610 --> 00:33:02.620
what this actually took us to is a
 

00:33:02.620 --> 00:33:06.210
what this actually took us to is a
settings page for getting other types of

media now in this defense this is an
 

00:33:09.310 --> 00:33:10.920
media now in this defense this is an
awesome piece of functionality I can

00:33:10.920 --> 00:33:10.930
awesome piece of functionality I can
 

00:33:10.930 --> 00:33:12.990

functionality and I solutely I did test

00:33:33.450 --> 00:33:33.460
functionality and I solutely I did test
 

00:33:33.460 --> 00:33:35.160
functionality and I solutely I did test
this with my Windows machine at home and

00:33:35.160 --> 00:33:35.170
this with my Windows machine at home and
 

00:33:35.170 --> 00:33:39.000
this with my Windows machine at home and
it screamed a large video directly off

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:39.010
it screamed a large video directly off
 

00:33:39.010 --> 00:33:40.560
it screamed a large video directly off
that machine and that made me super

00:33:40.560 --> 00:33:40.570
that machine and that made me super
 

00:33:40.570 --> 00:33:42.810
that machine and that made me super
happy absolutely but the functionality I

00:33:42.810 --> 00:33:42.820
happy absolutely but the functionality I
 

00:33:42.820 --> 00:33:45.090
happy absolutely but the functionality I
don't think I ever would have found if I

00:33:45.090 --> 00:33:45.100
don't think I ever would have found if I
 

00:33:45.100 --> 00:33:46.650
don't think I ever would have found if I
hadn't been thinking well T how do I get

00:33:46.650 --> 00:33:46.660
hadn't been thinking well T how do I get
 

00:33:46.660 --> 00:33:49.380
hadn't been thinking well T how do I get
to the home screen of it yeah well

particular functionality take one look

00:33:58.950 --> 00:33:58.960
particular functionality take one look
 

00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:01.950
particular functionality take one look
at the app go well no I can't see it

00:34:01.950 --> 00:34:01.960
at the app go well no I can't see it
 

00:34:01.960 --> 00:34:05.000
at the app go well no I can't see it
anywhere in Cal said anywhere here I

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:05.010
anywhere in Cal said anywhere here I
 

00:34:05.010 --> 00:34:07.920
anywhere in Cal said anywhere here I
guess I guess it doesn't do that all

00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:07.930
guess I guess it doesn't do that all
 

00:34:07.930 --> 00:34:08.220

right
and then move on to the next step so

00:34:10.100 --> 00:34:10.110
and then move on to the next step so
 

00:34:10.110 --> 00:34:12.480
and then move on to the next step so
make sure that any particularly useful

function I like this differentiating

00:34:14.280 --> 00:34:14.290
function I like this differentiating
 

00:34:14.290 --> 00:34:15.990
function I like this differentiating
functionalities is really easy to

00:34:15.990 --> 00:34:16.000
functionalities is really easy to
 

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:18.540
functionalities is really easy to
discover and while we're talking about

00:34:18.540 --> 00:34:18.550
discover and while we're talking about
 

00:34:18.550 --> 00:34:20.640
discover and while we're talking about
discovery 2 this is something I noticed

00:34:20.640 --> 00:34:20.650
discovery 2 this is something I noticed
 

00:34:20.650 --> 00:34:23.580
discovery 2 this is something I noticed
a lot with the settings a lot of times I

00:34:23.580 --> 00:34:23.590
a lot with the settings a lot of times I
 

00:34:23.590 --> 00:34:25.740
a lot with the settings a lot of times I
found apps that have really really

00:34:25.740 --> 00:34:25.750
found apps that have really really
 

00:34:25.750 --> 00:34:28.380
found apps that have really really
intriguing functionality and it's hidden

00:34:28.380 --> 00:34:28.390
intriguing functionality and it's hidden
 

00:34:28.390 --> 00:34:30.690
intriguing functionality and it's hidden
in a piece of the settings sometimes

00:34:30.690 --> 00:34:30.700
in a piece of the settings sometimes
 

00:34:30.700 --> 00:34:32.040
in a piece of the settings sometimes
that I wouldn't even even thought to

00:34:32.040 --> 00:34:32.050
that I wouldn't even even thought to
 

00:34:32.050 --> 00:34:34.620
that I wouldn't even even thought to
look for show and in some cases its

00:34:34.620 --> 00:34:34.630
look for show and in some cases its
 

00:34:34.630 --> 00:34:36.210
look for show and in some cases its
functionality that I really really

00:34:36.210 --> 00:34:36.220
functionality that I really really
 

00:34:36.220 --> 00:34:38.010
functionality that I really really
wanted that sort of wish was either

00:34:38.010 --> 00:34:38.020
wanted that sort of wish was either
 

00:34:38.020 --> 00:34:41.400
wanted that sort of wish was either
turned on by default or perhaps just

00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:41.410
turned on by default or perhaps just
 

00:34:41.410 --> 00:34:44.190
turned on by default or perhaps just
more discoverability because there's

00:34:44.190 --> 00:34:44.200
more discoverability because there's
 

00:34:44.200 --> 00:34:46.200
more discoverability because there's
some really cool stuff in here that I

00:34:46.200 --> 00:34:46.210
some really cool stuff in here that I
 

00:34:46.210 --> 00:34:50.059
some really cool stuff in here that I
wouldn't have thought to look for

00:34:50.059 --> 00:34:50.069
 

00:34:50.069 --> 00:34:53.700
now when it comes to playback there's a

00:34:53.700 --> 00:34:53.710
now when it comes to playback there's a
 

00:34:53.710 --> 00:34:55.200
now when it comes to playback there's a
couple of things that I really really

00:34:55.200 --> 00:34:55.210
couple of things that I really really
 

00:34:55.210 --> 00:34:57.210
couple of things that I really really
like about this application now I've

00:34:57.210 --> 00:34:57.220
like about this application now I've
 

00:34:57.220 --> 00:35:01.140
like about this application now I've
been using MX player more and I think

00:35:01.140 --> 00:35:01.150
been using MX player more and I think
 

00:35:01.150 --> 00:35:02.910
been using MX player more and I think
you have to yeah and there's really only

00:35:02.910 --> 00:35:02.920
you have to yeah and there's really only
 

00:35:02.920 --> 00:35:04.710
you have to yeah and there's really only
one reason for that and that's because

00:35:04.710 --> 00:35:04.720
one reason for that and that's because
 

00:35:04.720 --> 00:35:07.799
one reason for that and that's because
MX player doesn't hide my notification I

00:35:07.799 --> 00:35:07.809

so it kind of makes sense to default

00:43:47.309 --> 00:43:47.319
so it kind of makes sense to default
 

00:43:47.319 --> 00:43:50.220
so it kind of makes sense to default
that way so really there we just had
