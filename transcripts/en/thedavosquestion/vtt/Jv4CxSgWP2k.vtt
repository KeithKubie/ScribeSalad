JAMES NAKAGAWA &gt;&gt; Hi, James Nakagawa of Mobella
Healthcare. Ah-it's wonderful being at-here

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:10.500
at Davos. Everyone's talking about the economy
but I think what's been emerging more than

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.120
just the financial crisis is how-ah-the economy
is affecting people's health care.

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:22.510
And, as we all know-you know-health care is
a center of-ah-of everyone's daily life and

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:27.620
during this economic crisis-ah-it's much more
challenging. People are spiraling down. They're

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:31.230
going to go after creature comfort foods.
They're going to tip in and become diabetic

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.730
or they're not going to be buying their medications-ah-i-it's
absolutely terrible.

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:42.030
And I think that's where companies like us
now are-ah-are really helping to drive this

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:49.370
issue of-um-ah-mm-helping to provide a global
platform for self disease management, wellness

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:54.370
and prevention. And I-I just wanted to say
to everyone out there that-ah-the leaders

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:59.600
here are just phenomenal. They're all listening,
they're very proactive now. Health care is

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:06.750
taking center stage, and I think with what's
going on with the Obama inauguration in the

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.149
states-ah-it's coming to the forefront and
likely to be seen in Davos.
