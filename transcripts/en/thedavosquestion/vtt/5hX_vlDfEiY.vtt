00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.232
&gt;&gt; Hello YouTube. I am a Rabbi, part of the
religous group here at the world economic

00:00:05.232 --> 00:00:11.419
forum and we have come here and I have a short
rebuttal. It's like two people in a boat in

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:15.589
the midst of the ocean. One of the men is
drilling a hole in the boat and the other

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:20.439
one says you are killing yourself, killing
me too, why are you doing it? And the answer

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:27.189
of the man is, well, I'm only drilling a hole
in my part of the boat. We are all in the

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:33.760
boat so we have come to repentance because
the anchors and all of us have made great

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:42.780
mistakes. As a Rabbi, I also want to say that
I feel the pain of every Palestinian child

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:51.829
who was wounded, killed in Gaza. I feel the
pain of every Isreali child. But I think sharing

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:57.809
our pain is the one way in which we can really
build peace. And that was why the religous

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:03.640
leaders have meet here in Davos. We have made
the appeal. Let's try to look at each other's

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:12.470
eyes. We need each other and you know, I was
a child in 1943, a baby, and I was saved by

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:19.210
a catholic woman, a German woman and she opened
her door for me. Let's open the doors to all

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:25.080
the babies of the world. Therefore, if I have
one request to all the business people, the

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:32.430
politicians, the religous people, to you,
let's together make sure that the Millenium

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:39.850
Development Bills will be realized. Which
means, that in 2015, every child of the world

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:46.980
will have basic education, and every child
will have fresh water. When we do that then

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:51.780
we are trustworthy and repentant and there
will be peace.
