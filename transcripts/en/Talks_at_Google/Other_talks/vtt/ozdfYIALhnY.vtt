RAHUL TELANG: So
thank you so much.

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:09.860
Thank you, Hal,
for the kind words.

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:13.030
Thank you, Cliff and David,
for inviting us and hosting us

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:15.330
and organizing this.

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.450
Thank you all for coming
and spending your afternoon.

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:22.310
We are honored and excited to
be part of this conversation

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:26.610
and look forward to your
comments and your feedback.

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:29.080
This book, at some
level, is a summary

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:32.100
of some of the research agenda
that Michael and I have pursued

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:34.426
over the last 10, 15 years.

00:00:34.426 --> 00:00:36.600
And, in all honesty,
some of that research

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.740
was also supported
and funded by Google.

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:41.370
So thank you all around.

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.110
Appreciate it very much.

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.710
So we decided that maybe
we'll talk for about 30,

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:51.470
35 minutes, and then open
the floor for some discussion

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:52.700
and some questions.

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.070
So I'll take the first half.

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:55.820
Michael will speak
in the second half.

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.790
And then he also agreed that
any difficult questions,

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:00.980
he'll be more than
happy to tackle.

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:10.630
So let me start with a story
that we also have in the book.

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:12.580
Many of you might
have read this book,

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:15.410
would have seen the movie
"The Perfect Storm."

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:20.760
And the idea behind the book
was there were this, I think,

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:24.870
six seamen who were
trying to get to the land

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:29.320
as quickly as possible because
they had a valuable catch.

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.870
The only trouble was to
get to the route that

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:34.340
was the quickest
to the land also

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.780
had turbulent weather
and potential storms.

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.830
But the crew thought
that they have experience

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:43.740
dealing with such
storms and they

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.370
would be able to survive this.

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:50.520
So they decided to take
that particular route.

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.270
But they underestimated
the risk.

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:57.620
And what happens is they
ran into not just one storm,

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:59.840
but confluence of storms.

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.390
That's why they titled
"The Perfect Storm."

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:06.150
And, unfortunately,
they perished.

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:10.699
What we believe that in
the entertainment industry,

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:14.030
similar technological
turbulence and disruptions

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:15.180
are taking place.

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.330
And unless and until
the traditional firms

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.010
are able to adapt and
change their business model,

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.190
they're going to be at a
significant competitive

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:25.330
disadvantage.

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.530
And when I say
entertainment industry,

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:32.110
predominantly we'll discuss the
publishing industry, the music

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:36.660
industry, the television and
the motion picture industry.

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.770
And I'm going to talk
a little bit about what

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:41.180
are some of the major
technological changes

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.240
that are taking place.

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:47.110
But before I go there, I wanted
to spend a little bit of time

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:49.580
going back in
history and arguing

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:53.530
that this industry pretty
much has been dominated

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:55.970
by a very few players.

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:57.750
If you look at the
history of 100 years--

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.291
whether it's
publishing, whether it's

00:02:59.291 --> 00:03:02.310
motion picture, whether
it's music industry--

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:05.520
a few firms have essentially
dominated this industry

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.800
for a long period of time.

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:11.240
And sometimes the very same
firms that have dominated.

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:13.960
And you wonder, what is
it about the industry,

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:17.320
or what is it about the firms,
that gives them that advantage

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:21.580
to continue to acquire and
have a large market share?

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:23.250
So one of the most
important assets

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.420
you needed to have if you
were in this industry,

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:27.220
if you were one of
these firms, was

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:30.090
that you needed scale and size.

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.110
And why did you
need scale and size?

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:34.880
For the simple reason that
one of the core functions

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.680
many of these firms perform
was to basically find

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:42.730
the talent, hopefully predict
that some of that talent

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:45.780
is going to be turned
into stars or superstars--

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:49.040
so whether you are a music label
or whether you're a publisher,

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:51.630
you're trying to find that
author or you're trying

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:56.290
to find that artist who is
going to become successful.

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:59.800
Unfortunately, to be able
to make that prediction,

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:04.590
to be able to figure out who
is going to be that next star

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:06.660
was unscientific at best.

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:08.200
There was very little data.

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.140
There was very little
analysis that one

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:12.760
could do to figure out.

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:16.230
You could have some
information, but broadly it

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:18.390
was difficult to say who
is going to be successful

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:19.890
and who is going to fail.

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:22.940
And most of the artists,
or most of the authors,

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:25.120
of most of the scripts
probably turn out

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.080
to be not all that
much successful.

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:30.250
In fact, a very few, a
handful, of the projects

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:32.510
actually became very successful.

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:35.470
So, naturally, the
one business principle

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:40.650
was to follow the gut feel or
follow your superior instincts

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:43.940
to identify the
potential talent and then

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:46.207
get it to the mass audience.

00:04:46.207 --> 00:04:47.790
There was a very
nice quote, actually,

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:51.290
by William Goldman who said
that nobody knows anything.

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:55.620
In the motion picture
industry, everything

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:57.120
was basically a guess.

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:00.200
And if you're lucky,
that's an educated guess.

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:06.410
So that was how, more or
less, some of the processes

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:08.910
in the industry worked.

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:13.160
And beyond, then, finding
the talent, the second job

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:15.960
that the firm needed
to do was to get it

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:18.580
in front of the audience,
basically convince

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:21.150
the audience in the mass
market that you actually

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:24.310
have a superstar waiting.

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:30.660
So now you have a majority of
the projects likely to fail.

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:33.870
So you needed scale and size
to support a slew of projects

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:36.960
so a few of them turn out
to be very successful.

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:41.580
And then you needed power to
be able to very aggressively

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:45.370
campaign for that star, for
that artist, for that movie.

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:49.000
So you needed to
influence a radio station

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.830
to play your artist's songs so
that people can listen to that.

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:56.600
Or, in a physical store, where
there was a limited shelf

00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:00.010
space, you needed power to be
able to convince that retailer

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:03.060
to stock your item and
prominently display it

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:06.520
and so on and so forth so
that people can know about it.

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:08.590
Again, the firm who had
the scale and the size

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:12.130
and the stable of successful
stars were able to do it.

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:14.260
If you were a small
independent firm,

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:17.020
it was tough to compete against
that model on both sides

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:18.880
where you needed scale and size.

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:22.650
So, naturally, if you are a
budding artist or an author

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:25.010
or a script writer,
you probably felt

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:27.740
that going with the big firms
was the ticket to success

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:32.600
because they had these
natural advantages.

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:34.790
The third thing they
also did and they

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:38.930
had going for them was
that they could control

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:44.380
their content where they
could-- what we call usually

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:47.110
is that apply some of the
product discrimination

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:48.000
strategy.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.740
So what they could do was sell
the same or similar product

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:56.060
at different times to different
people in different channels

00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:59.280
and be able to monetize the
product over its lifetime.

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:02.170
So, for example, if you are in
the motion picture industry,

00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:04.020
the movie will
release in a theater,

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:05.830
then it will go on
the DVD, then it

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:07.375
will go into the
pay-per-view, then

00:07:07.375 --> 00:07:10.920
it'll go into the HBO window
over there, so on and so forth.

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:13.640
And all of these formats
allow you to both expand

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:16.750
your market-- so more and
more people can watch--

00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:18.450
and sometimes
actually allowed you

00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:20.700
to sell the similar
product multiple times

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:21.780
to the same user.

00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:24.980
So you watch the movie in
theater, you also got the DVD,

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:30.930
and you might have watched
the movie back on the TV.

00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:33.600
So once you have all
of these three going--

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:36.400
which is you could control
the supply of talent,

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:38.000
you could control
the distribution,

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:42.880
and you could control how
the content was flowing

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:46.025
through various channels--
you had a very successful

00:07:46.025 --> 00:07:48.470
and a robust business model.

00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:51.575
And this particular model
worked for a very long time.

00:07:51.575 --> 00:07:53.700
In fact, it worked so well
that most of these forms

00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:56.050
were highly successful
and profitable.

00:07:56.050 --> 00:07:59.010
And one of the senior
executives actually

00:07:59.010 --> 00:08:03.519
came to one of our classes,
and he was very confident,

00:08:03.519 --> 00:08:05.060
saying, look, we
have been successful

00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:07.060
for the last 100 years.

00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:09.160
We know how to
create the content.

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:11.130
And there is no
reason why we will not

00:08:11.130 --> 00:08:14.280
continue to be successful in
the foreseeable future as well.

00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:16.710
Look at our business model.

00:08:16.710 --> 00:08:18.540
So what are the
technology disruptions

00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:20.760
we believe have been taking
place over the last 10

00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:23.030
or 15 years that we
believe are eroding

00:08:23.030 --> 00:08:25.360
some of these advantages
that the firm has?

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:30.350
The first is the
internet and broadband.

00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:32.840
It might seem trivial, but
the internet and broadband

00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:34.799
had this enormous impact.

00:08:34.799 --> 00:08:39.049
Some of that impact came through
that the internet basically

00:08:39.049 --> 00:08:43.740
spawned enormous amount of
online piracy and infringement

00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:45.000
of content.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.090
In fact, if you go back and
look at the music industry,

00:08:48.090 --> 00:08:51.200
you could literally
split the music industry

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:54.380
into two periods, before
Napster and after Napster.

00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:57.370
That's the kind of impact
the Napsters of this world

00:08:57.370 --> 00:09:00.220
had on the industry.

00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:02.790
So going beyond the
fact that piracy

00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:05.300
had a very large negative
effect on the firms' ability

00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:08.750
to monetize, it actually
had a large effect

00:09:08.750 --> 00:09:12.890
on their windowing strategy and
how they released the product.

00:09:12.890 --> 00:09:16.060
Now it was very hard to
wait and release the product

00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:18.010
in the international
market a month later

00:09:18.010 --> 00:09:20.330
because piracy ate
into that revenue.

00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:22.780
It became harder for
you to delay the product

00:09:22.780 --> 00:09:25.050
in one channel versus
the other channel

00:09:25.050 --> 00:09:27.730
because, again, people
found it easier to then go

00:09:27.730 --> 00:09:29.090
and essentially infringe.

00:09:29.090 --> 00:09:34.360
So your ability to monetize the
lifecycle of the product, which

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:37.100
was a very valuable source
of revenues for some

00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:40.350
of these quote, unquote
"catalog titles,"

00:09:40.350 --> 00:09:45.380
became much more challenging
when the internet and broadband

00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:50.020
came about and started
cutting into your ability

00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:54.270
to control the content.

00:09:54.270 --> 00:09:56.120
This is a very quick
example I'll give.

00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:58.190
This was an example of
how this control got

00:09:58.190 --> 00:09:59.480
eroded a little bit.

00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:03.310
This was a dispute NBC
had with Apple iTunes.

00:10:03.310 --> 00:10:05.710
And NBC decided
that they were going

00:10:05.710 --> 00:10:10.750
to take all the content
away from iTunes in the hope

00:10:10.750 --> 00:10:13.660
that maybe they will be able
to exert some power on Apple

00:10:13.660 --> 00:10:17.250
to sign a more favorable deal.

00:10:17.250 --> 00:10:19.030
Basically what
happened is as soon

00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:22.440
as NBC took the content
away from Apple,

00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:25.100
people started flocking
to BitTorrent network

00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:26.930
and started downloading
what was available

00:10:26.930 --> 00:10:32.320
legally now from the
piracy network, again,

00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:36.350
suggesting that your
ability to then negotiate

00:10:36.350 --> 00:10:38.980
with different
channels got severely

00:10:38.980 --> 00:10:42.080
eroded because the
piracy came about

00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:44.550
and people found it
much easier, then,

00:10:44.550 --> 00:10:48.320
to get the content from
sources if you didn't make it

00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:51.510
available on the legal channel.

00:10:51.510 --> 00:10:53.030
The second thing
that happened was,

00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:55.130
then, the digitization
meant that there

00:10:55.130 --> 00:11:00.380
were revolution where the
cost of producing content

00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:01.830
fell very significantly.

00:11:01.830 --> 00:11:06.240
So now you can write a book,
you can record music, or even

00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:07.870
shoot a movie at
a fraction of cost

00:11:07.870 --> 00:11:09.860
than what was possible earlier.

00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:13.740
And then you had this bunch
of platforms like the YouTubes

00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:18.480
and Facebook and what have
you that made it much cheaper

00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:21.270
for people to actually
get their product

00:11:21.270 --> 00:11:24.130
and get their content in
front of the mass audience.

00:11:24.130 --> 00:11:28.390
So, at some level, the big
companies, the major players,

00:11:28.390 --> 00:11:30.140
in the industry did two things.

00:11:30.140 --> 00:11:32.380
They identified the talent.

00:11:32.380 --> 00:11:34.960
And the got the talent
to the mass market.

00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:38.820
And now you had the
technology changes happening,

00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:42.680
which made the role of a
gatekeeper for these firms,

00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:46.330
again, got eroded because many
people started bypassing them

00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:47.880
and said we can directly go.

00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:50.440
It doesn't happen all the
time, but for many artists

00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:52.010
it's much easier to do.

00:11:52.010 --> 00:11:54.450
That again meant that
their ability to negotiate

00:11:54.450 --> 00:11:56.760
with artists and authors
and script writers

00:11:56.760 --> 00:12:00.080
and what have you
was, again, eroded

00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:02.750
because of these digitisation.

00:12:02.750 --> 00:12:05.190
So we give many
examples in the book.

00:12:05.190 --> 00:12:08.480
Here are all of the different
players who actually bypassed,

00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:11.640
to an extent, that
traditional players, and on

00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:13.940
their own right, actually
became very successful.

00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:17.460
So Amanda Hocking became a
very popular author just doing

00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:18.840
self-publishing.

00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:21.110
Lindsey Stirling, who
is a hip-hop violinist

00:12:21.110 --> 00:12:24.005
and musician-- the
music label thought

00:12:24.005 --> 00:12:27.550
that she doesn't fit into any
traditional categorization.

00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:30.190
She became a YouTube sensation.

00:12:30.190 --> 00:12:33.050
"Fifty Shades of Gray,"
probably all of you know,

00:12:33.050 --> 00:12:36.770
it's a blockbuster, but actually
it was a very obscure book.

00:12:36.770 --> 00:12:40.580
It was a self-published
book and totally relied

00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:43.545
on viral marketing
to get its name out.

00:12:43.545 --> 00:12:46.590
And obviously, now it's a
multimillion dollar product.

00:12:46.590 --> 00:12:49.580
Or Neelesh Misra, who runs
a radio show in India which

00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:51.090
is completely crowd-sourced.

00:12:51.090 --> 00:12:52.990
So he sources all these movies.

00:12:52.990 --> 00:12:54.610
People submit the stories.

00:12:54.610 --> 00:12:57.500
Everything gets outsourced
and crowd-sourced.

00:12:57.500 --> 00:12:59.870
And he runs a very,
very popular show.

00:12:59.870 --> 00:13:01.460
In all of these
examples, what you see

00:13:01.460 --> 00:13:03.840
is that the middlemen,
or the gatekeepers,

00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:08.450
or their ability to exercise
power got eroded a little bit.

00:13:08.450 --> 00:13:12.030
And finally, what we
had was the growth

00:13:12.030 --> 00:13:14.920
of these online
platforms-- the Amazons,

00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:18.380
the Netflix, the YouTubes,
and the Googles of this world.

00:13:18.380 --> 00:13:20.150
They did not have a
limited shelf space.

00:13:20.150 --> 00:13:22.520
So Amazon could stock
hundreds and thousands

00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:28.820
of books or movies
or music titles.

00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:33.760
And they also
realized that to be

00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:37.320
able to satisfy
their customer, they

00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:40.130
needed to use the information
they're collecting

00:13:40.130 --> 00:13:43.320
from their consumers to
offer appropriate and correct

00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:45.670
recommendations to
delight its consumers.

00:13:45.670 --> 00:13:48.610
So it started using
enormous amount of data

00:13:48.610 --> 00:13:51.680
to make that appropriate
recommendations.

00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:55.290
So on one hand, we
had the major players

00:13:55.290 --> 00:13:57.380
who did content curation.

00:13:57.380 --> 00:13:58.860
So they decided
which content was

00:13:58.860 --> 00:14:00.560
going to go in
front of the public

00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:02.700
and controlled the content.

00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:05.900
And on the other hand, we had
the online platform that said,

00:14:05.900 --> 00:14:07.480
I'm not going to do
content curation.

00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:09.980
Every content is
available on my platform.

00:14:09.980 --> 00:14:11.870
But I will make it easy.

00:14:11.870 --> 00:14:13.930
I will make it
easy for consumers

00:14:13.930 --> 00:14:15.570
to find what they actually like.

00:14:15.570 --> 00:14:18.480
So I'll offer them what I
believe that the consumer might

00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:19.920
be interested in.

00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:21.910
So, again, some of the
power started shifting

00:14:21.910 --> 00:14:23.295
toward these online players.

00:14:23.295 --> 00:14:24.920
Obviously, I don't
have to convince you

00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:28.310
that the Amazons and
Netflix are-- their scale

00:14:28.310 --> 00:14:29.700
and size is also much bigger.

00:14:29.700 --> 00:14:32.340
Netflix operates in 80
different countries.

00:14:32.340 --> 00:14:34.790
Amazon has a very
large footprint.

00:14:34.790 --> 00:14:37.290
So now they have
this enormous power

00:14:37.290 --> 00:14:39.230
in deciding how to
price the product,

00:14:39.230 --> 00:14:42.260
how to promote the product,
how to recommend the product

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:45.680
to the end user, again, means
that they have a lot more

00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:48.160
negotiating power
when they're getting

00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:51.880
the content from the
content creators,

00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:55.399
whether it's music or movies
and so on and so forth.

00:14:55.399 --> 00:14:56.940
Now all of this
still would have been

00:14:56.940 --> 00:14:59.120
fine except that some
of these companies

00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:02.270
then decided that they actually
want to now go into the content

00:15:02.270 --> 00:15:04.020
production.

00:15:04.020 --> 00:15:07.710
So the Netflix of the word
then decided that, look,

00:15:07.710 --> 00:15:10.700
I have deep pockets.

00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:13.760
We have this enormous amount of
customer data and a very large

00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:15.050
customer base.

00:15:15.050 --> 00:15:15.760
Why not?

00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:18.820
I can hire the talent which
can create the content.

00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:22.510
And I will become a
vertically integrated company,

00:15:22.510 --> 00:15:25.720
from creating the
content to distributing

00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:28.430
and promoting and advertising
the content to my consumer

00:15:28.430 --> 00:15:30.300
base.

00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:34.355
And this is one of
the biggest important

00:15:34.355 --> 00:15:38.110
and a competitive threat
to the existing players.

00:15:38.110 --> 00:15:41.530
And now Michael is going to
talk about the way Netflix goes

00:15:41.530 --> 00:15:44.820
about creating the content
is very different than how

00:15:44.820 --> 00:15:48.690
the traditional players have
generally created the content.

00:15:48.690 --> 00:15:53.980
And one more element being
that all of these companies,

00:15:53.980 --> 00:15:55.560
they basically make
decisions based

00:15:55.560 --> 00:15:59.380
on data rather than on
gut feel or on instincts.

00:15:59.380 --> 00:16:01.220
They have a large consumer base.

00:16:01.220 --> 00:16:04.590
They have enormous amount of
data about what consumer does,

00:16:04.590 --> 00:16:07.700
what consumer doesn't do,
what are their preferences.

00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:10.710
They hire the people who have
the skills to actually use

00:16:10.710 --> 00:16:11.860
that data.

00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:14.160
And based on that
combination, now they

00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:17.190
are going in the market
and saying, I can actually

00:16:17.190 --> 00:16:19.400
do better than some of
these traditional firms

00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:20.880
potentially can do.

00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:23.290
I have the financial
wherewithal.

00:16:23.290 --> 00:16:28.470
I have this enormous consumer
base that's loyal to me.

00:16:28.470 --> 00:16:30.160
And this is, really,
at some level,

00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:32.370
we are talking about
the perfect storm

00:16:32.370 --> 00:16:34.820
that the traditional
players are facing.

00:16:34.820 --> 00:16:36.820
So Michael is going
to probably talk

00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:38.050
about how they're using it.

00:16:38.050 --> 00:16:41.070
MICHAEL SMITH: Thanks, Rahul.

00:16:41.070 --> 00:16:43.880
So I would argue, if this
were a traditional industry,

00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:46.230
we could stop right
here and go directly

00:16:46.230 --> 00:16:47.340
to what they should do.

00:16:47.340 --> 00:16:49.810
I think there's
a strong argument

00:16:49.810 --> 00:16:53.370
you can make that technology
is changing the source of power

00:16:53.370 --> 00:16:54.750
in this industry.

00:16:54.750 --> 00:16:57.750
Let's talk about what
the industry should do.

00:16:57.750 --> 00:16:59.410
I would argue that
entertainment is not

00:16:59.410 --> 00:17:01.930
a typical industry in
the sense that they're

00:17:01.930 --> 00:17:04.069
very interested in
the second question.

00:17:04.069 --> 00:17:06.460
Will technological
change actually

00:17:06.460 --> 00:17:09.000
damage my ability to
make great content?

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:10.910
And you might disagree
with me about this,

00:17:10.910 --> 00:17:13.450
but I think this
question, in many ways,

00:17:13.450 --> 00:17:16.530
is every bit as important
to the traditional industry

00:17:16.530 --> 00:17:18.614
as the first question is.

00:17:18.614 --> 00:17:20.030
I think if you
were to say, here's

00:17:20.030 --> 00:17:22.540
a technology that's going to
allow you to make more money,

00:17:22.540 --> 00:17:25.200
but it's going to
significantly damage

00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:27.140
the quality of storytelling,
they'd probably

00:17:27.140 --> 00:17:28.140
say, hey, you know what?

00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:31.590
We'll just stick
with what we've got.

00:17:31.590 --> 00:17:36.460
So let me tell a story
about why this might damage

00:17:36.460 --> 00:17:38.760
the quality of storytelling.

00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:41.670
A few years ago, I was
sitting with Monte,

00:17:41.670 --> 00:17:45.000
and we were getting ready
to watch "House of Cards"

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:46.291
on Netflix.

00:17:46.291 --> 00:17:47.540
We were on our favorite couch.

00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:48.930
I'd turned off the lights.

00:17:48.930 --> 00:17:51.720
And we start the show.

00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:53.950
If you've seen the first
episode of "House of Cards,"

00:17:53.950 --> 00:17:57.530
you know it starts with
a black screen, and then

00:17:57.530 --> 00:18:01.560
the sound of screeching tires,
and then a collision, and then

00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:03.640
a whimpering dog.

00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:06.590
And at this point, Kevin
Spacey's character,

00:18:06.590 --> 00:18:08.950
Senator Frank Underwood,
comes out of his house

00:18:08.950 --> 00:18:12.100
and approaches the
scene of the accident.

00:18:12.100 --> 00:18:15.200
Now Monte was clearly
nervous at this point.

00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:17.780
He was huddled up all the way
at the other end of the couch

00:18:17.780 --> 00:18:19.720
and looking very uncomfortable.

00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:21.870
But I figured
everything's going to be.

00:18:21.870 --> 00:18:24.240
As the lead character,
Frank Underwood's

00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:26.855
going to do what lead characters
always do when you introduce

00:18:26.855 --> 00:18:27.730
them to the audience.

00:18:27.730 --> 00:18:31.230
He's going to perform some noble
act to endear himself to us,

00:18:31.230 --> 00:18:35.105
like saving or protecting
the injured dog.

00:18:35.105 --> 00:18:36.480
So Frank Underwood
does something

00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:37.720
completely unexpected.

00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:39.610
He approaches the dog.

00:18:39.610 --> 00:18:41.860
And then he speaks
directly to the camera.

00:18:41.860 --> 00:18:46.650
And he leans down and
strangles the animal.

00:18:46.650 --> 00:18:47.550
So this was too much.

00:18:47.550 --> 00:18:49.100
I had to turn off the show.

00:18:49.100 --> 00:18:53.190
I had to turn back on the
lights so I wouldn't severely

00:18:53.190 --> 00:18:57.450
scar my friend Monte.

00:18:57.450 --> 00:19:02.137
Now why might this be
bad for entertainment?

00:19:02.137 --> 00:19:03.970
After all, ever since
we've had televisions,

00:19:03.970 --> 00:19:07.390
people have been turning them
off for all sorts of reasons.

00:19:07.390 --> 00:19:09.660
The reason this might
be bad for entertainment

00:19:09.660 --> 00:19:12.960
is that now Netflix knows
exactly when Monte and I turned

00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:14.350
off the show.

00:19:14.350 --> 00:19:17.990
And the fear is they might
combine that with information

00:19:17.990 --> 00:19:21.540
about when millions of other
viewers turned off their shows

00:19:21.540 --> 00:19:25.310
and use that to start to use
data and algorithms to make

00:19:25.310 --> 00:19:27.750
creative decisions.

00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:30.240
Makes sense?

00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:33.880
So that's the concern.

00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:37.410
And that's the real
motivation for why

00:19:37.410 --> 00:19:41.220
we wanted to include the answer
to this question in the book,

00:19:41.220 --> 00:19:44.440
is a lot of people are worried
that technological change is

00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:48.110
going to damage the
quality of entertainment.

00:19:48.110 --> 00:19:50.990
While we were writing the
book, we learned an awful lot

00:19:50.990 --> 00:19:56.400
about this question and an
awful lot about the industry.

00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:59.820
The first thing we learned
is that writing a book

00:19:59.820 --> 00:20:01.800
is really hard.

00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:03.560
This was our first book.

00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:06.180
As academics, we feel
pretty comfortable writing

00:20:06.180 --> 00:20:08.350
30-page papers.

00:20:08.350 --> 00:20:10.630
So when we sat down with
our editor at MIT Press,

00:20:10.630 --> 00:20:13.030
and she said the
book ought to be 200,

00:20:13.030 --> 00:20:16.320
maybe 250 pages long, Rahul
and I looked at each other.

00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:18.282
We did the math,
and we said, sounds

00:20:18.282 --> 00:20:20.740
like if we write seven 30-page
papers, we ought to be done.

00:20:20.740 --> 00:20:22.360
How hard could that be?

00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:24.290
And the answer is,
you're an idiot.

00:20:24.290 --> 00:20:27.950
Writing a book is nothing like
writing seven different papers.

00:20:27.950 --> 00:20:30.320
The reason it's different
is that your publisher

00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:32.730
expects you to tell a story.

00:20:32.730 --> 00:20:35.940
And storytelling is
just incredibly hard.

00:20:35.940 --> 00:20:37.770
And I think the
painful realization

00:20:37.770 --> 00:20:39.580
of just how difficult
storytelling

00:20:39.580 --> 00:20:44.530
is gave me and Rahul a
much deeper appreciation

00:20:44.530 --> 00:20:46.800
for the many talented
storytellers in the publishing,

00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:48.790
music, and movie
businesses, and for how much

00:20:48.790 --> 00:20:51.040
we all benefit from
the work they do.

00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:53.280
But I think also
a renewed passion

00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:54.930
for understanding
whether technology

00:20:54.930 --> 00:20:58.860
might be damaging their
ability to bring great stories

00:20:58.860 --> 00:21:01.680
to the audience.

00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:03.320
And many of our
friends in the industry

00:21:03.320 --> 00:21:06.360
are worried that it
will, and not just

00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:08.130
because using data
and algorithms

00:21:08.130 --> 00:21:09.810
to make creative
decisions could be

00:21:09.810 --> 00:21:12.570
bad for the quality of content.

00:21:12.570 --> 00:21:15.710
They're also worried that
the new data driven platforms

00:21:15.710 --> 00:21:18.480
are just making too much
content in the first place.

00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:21.190
So in recent years,
we've seen an explosion

00:21:21.190 --> 00:21:24.770
in new creative output, much
of it coming from Silicon

00:21:24.770 --> 00:21:27.120
Valley, not Hollywood.

00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:29.940
Think "Orange is the New
Black," "Transparent,"

00:21:29.940 --> 00:21:33.060
or my new favorite,
"Stranger Things."

00:21:33.060 --> 00:21:35.400
And things in this
industry, I would argue,

00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:36.860
just keep getting stranger.

00:21:36.860 --> 00:21:39.940
In the past year,
Netflix announced

00:21:39.940 --> 00:21:42.969
that it was tripling its
output of original programming.

00:21:42.969 --> 00:21:44.510
Amazon announced
that they were going

00:21:44.510 --> 00:21:49.750
to start to produce 12 movies
per year for their platform.

00:21:49.750 --> 00:21:55.020
And this little company called
Google announced YouTube Red

00:21:55.020 --> 00:22:00.000
with plans for 10 original
movies of their own.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:03.110
Carleton Cuse, the Emmy
award-winning showrunner,

00:22:03.110 --> 00:22:05.970
argued that this is going
to be bad for the quality

00:22:05.970 --> 00:22:06.730
of entertainment.

00:22:06.730 --> 00:22:08.200
And he used a sports analogy.

00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:10.920
What he said is this
explosion in new output

00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:13.630
is very similar to what would
happen if the NFL suddenly

00:22:13.630 --> 00:22:15.891
expanded to have 90 teams.

00:22:15.891 --> 00:22:18.140
You have a whole bunch more
football available to you,

00:22:18.140 --> 00:22:20.880
but the quality of it would
be significantly diluted.

00:22:25.070 --> 00:22:28.630
But if data is going to ruin
the quality of entertainment,

00:22:28.630 --> 00:22:30.810
then why are the new
data driven platforms

00:22:30.810 --> 00:22:33.260
winning so many awards?

00:22:33.260 --> 00:22:38.140
Netflix has taken home
133 Emmy nominations,

00:22:38.140 --> 00:22:40.550
including 54 this year alone.

00:22:40.550 --> 00:22:43.570
And this past December,
Netflix and Amazon

00:22:43.570 --> 00:22:45.620
had more Golden
Globe nominations

00:22:45.620 --> 00:22:48.160
than the combined number of
nominations for the top four

00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:50.375
broadcast networks.

00:22:50.375 --> 00:22:52.500
And it's not just critics
who are happy with what's

00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:54.310
going on in Silicon Valley.

00:22:54.310 --> 00:22:57.020
Kevin Spacey himself
called his experience

00:22:57.020 --> 00:23:00.920
making "House of Cards" the
most fun and most creatively

00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:04.810
rewarding experience I've
ever had in front of a camera.

00:23:04.810 --> 00:23:07.190
So creativity, it
would seem, is actually

00:23:07.190 --> 00:23:11.970
thriving in the hands of these
new data driven providers.

00:23:11.970 --> 00:23:15.910
And to understand why, let's
take the advice of Senator

00:23:15.910 --> 00:23:18.880
Frank Underwood and
take a step back,

00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:21.440
look at the bigger picture.

00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:24.224
That's the best Kevin
Spacey I-- anyway.

00:23:24.224 --> 00:23:25.490
AUDIENCE: Keep working on it

00:23:25.490 --> 00:23:26.531
MICHAEL SMITH: Thank you.

00:23:26.531 --> 00:23:29.920
Yeah, don't quit your day job.

00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:30.420
All right.

00:23:30.420 --> 00:23:35.030
So let's start with the concern
that data driven companies

00:23:35.030 --> 00:23:39.040
are going to start using data
to make creative decisions.

00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:41.330
This concern is
perfectly reasonable

00:23:41.330 --> 00:23:44.280
given how the industry
has always worked.

00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:46.620
Prior to Netflix,
greenlighting decisions

00:23:46.620 --> 00:23:49.540
were made by a roomful
of industry veterans.

00:23:49.540 --> 00:23:53.620
And these experts sat down and
used their years of experience

00:23:53.620 --> 00:23:57.410
to estimate how many people
were likely to watch the show.

00:23:57.410 --> 00:24:00.070
And then they used their
beliefs about customer behavior

00:24:00.070 --> 00:24:02.590
to give the creators notes
about which scenes should

00:24:02.590 --> 00:24:05.630
be cut so as to ensure
they retained the audience

00:24:05.630 --> 00:24:10.660
and made the best use of
the scarce broadcast slots.

00:24:10.660 --> 00:24:13.530
Given how prevalent
this is in the industry,

00:24:13.530 --> 00:24:15.920
it's perfectly
reasonable to assume

00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:18.370
that Netflix and
Amazon and Google

00:24:18.370 --> 00:24:21.580
would use their data to
replicate these processes,

00:24:21.580 --> 00:24:24.970
basing greenlighting decisions
on actual audience statistics

00:24:24.970 --> 00:24:28.250
and then telling creators
which seems to cut based

00:24:28.250 --> 00:24:30.780
on actual audience
behavior instead of notes

00:24:30.780 --> 00:24:34.800
about how audiences
were likely to respond.

00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:36.470
But taking a step
back, it's clear

00:24:36.470 --> 00:24:39.770
that Netflix and
Amazon and you guys

00:24:39.770 --> 00:24:44.490
aren't using data to
make creative decisions.

00:24:44.490 --> 00:24:48.430
Let's consider the greenlighting
process for a second.

00:24:48.430 --> 00:24:56.140
Again, prior to Netflix,
people used industry expertise

00:24:56.140 --> 00:24:58.002
to make these decisions.

00:24:58.002 --> 00:24:59.460
And a lot of people
in the industry

00:24:59.460 --> 00:25:02.040
have concluded that
Netflix was able to see

00:25:02.040 --> 00:25:03.710
the potential for
"House of Cards"

00:25:03.710 --> 00:25:05.150
before anyone else
in the industry

00:25:05.150 --> 00:25:07.630
because Netflix was able
to look into its data

00:25:07.630 --> 00:25:11.020
and discover that there were a
lot of fans of Kevin Spacey's

00:25:11.020 --> 00:25:13.240
acting, a lot of fans of
David Fincher's directing,

00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:15.680
and a lot of fans of the
BBC's "House of Cards."

00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:18.380
And that's what gave them
a competitive advantage.

00:25:18.380 --> 00:25:19.330
But if you think
about it for a second,

00:25:19.330 --> 00:25:21.900
that can't possibly be what gave
them a competitive advantage

00:25:21.900 --> 00:25:23.275
because everybody
in the industry

00:25:23.275 --> 00:25:26.010
already knew that Kevin
Spacey and David Fincher were

00:25:26.010 --> 00:25:30.070
huge hits, and that the
BBC's "House of Cards"

00:25:30.070 --> 00:25:32.270
had been a huge success.

00:25:32.270 --> 00:25:35.480
The advantage Netflix got
was from using its data

00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:37.560
to do something that no
traditional broadcast

00:25:37.560 --> 00:25:39.030
network could replicate.

00:25:39.030 --> 00:25:41.260
Netflix's advantage
didn't come from knowing

00:25:41.260 --> 00:25:44.460
how many fans of Kevin
Spacey were in the audience.

00:25:44.460 --> 00:25:46.740
Netflix's advantage came
from knowing exactly who they

00:25:46.740 --> 00:25:49.230
were as individuals
and their ability

00:25:49.230 --> 00:25:51.227
to promote content
to them directly

00:25:51.227 --> 00:25:52.810
based on their
individual preferences.

00:25:55.400 --> 00:25:58.339
Netflix's advantage also
changed how content was made.

00:25:58.339 --> 00:26:00.630
So let's go back to the first
scene of "House of Cards"

00:26:00.630 --> 00:26:02.580
I talked about a second ago.

00:26:02.580 --> 00:26:05.730
At the 2014 Aspen
Ideas Festival,

00:26:05.730 --> 00:26:08.680
head writer Beau Willimon
said that this scene

00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:12.410
was very controversial among
many of the TV veterans

00:26:12.410 --> 00:26:14.380
on his creative team.

00:26:14.380 --> 00:26:17.185
They said, you can't kill a dog.

00:26:17.185 --> 00:26:19.560
You're going to lose half your
viewership in the first 30

00:26:19.560 --> 00:26:21.150
seconds.

00:26:21.150 --> 00:26:23.960
So apparently Willimon
went to David Fincher

00:26:23.960 --> 00:26:25.540
and said, hey man,
are you worried

00:26:25.540 --> 00:26:27.540
that we're going to lose
half our audience if we

00:26:27.540 --> 00:26:29.250
include this scene?

00:26:29.250 --> 00:26:32.612
And Fincher said, I
don't give a shit.

00:26:32.612 --> 00:26:34.070
And Willimon said
he didn't either,

00:26:34.070 --> 00:26:37.440
so they left the scene in.

00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:39.850
That level of
creative freedom would

00:26:39.850 --> 00:26:42.710
have been almost unthinkable
in traditional broadcast

00:26:42.710 --> 00:26:43.350
television.

00:26:43.350 --> 00:26:48.250
On the same Aspen Ideas panel,
Disney veteran Michael Eisner

00:26:48.250 --> 00:26:49.790
said that if he had
tried to include

00:26:49.790 --> 00:26:53.010
a similarly violent scene
in an episode of broadcast

00:26:53.010 --> 00:26:55.394
television, the head of
the network would call me,

00:26:55.394 --> 00:26:57.060
the chairman of the
board would call me,

00:26:57.060 --> 00:26:59.740
I would be out in 10 minutes.

00:26:59.740 --> 00:27:02.750
So the question is why did this
scene work for Netflix, but not

00:27:02.750 --> 00:27:05.730
for broadcast television?

00:27:05.730 --> 00:27:07.520
The first answer
and the easy one

00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:09.930
is that Netflix wasn't pursuing
an advertising-supported

00:27:09.930 --> 00:27:10.690
business model.

00:27:10.690 --> 00:27:13.030
So it didn't have to worry
about offending advertisers

00:27:13.030 --> 00:27:16.480
by including a potentially
controversial scene.

00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:18.410
I think the more
profound answer, though,

00:27:18.410 --> 00:27:21.110
is that Netflix didn't
face the same scarcity

00:27:21.110 --> 00:27:23.140
that traditional
broadcast networks do.

00:27:23.140 --> 00:27:24.820
In a traditional
broadcast network,

00:27:24.820 --> 00:27:27.710
you can only deliver
one show at a time.

00:27:27.710 --> 00:27:31.940
So that show has to appeal to
as many viewers as possible.

00:27:31.940 --> 00:27:34.730
But a Netflix subscriber who
was offended by Kevin Spacey's

00:27:34.730 --> 00:27:37.090
actions could choose from
thousands of other shows

00:27:37.090 --> 00:27:38.500
on Netflix.

00:27:38.500 --> 00:27:41.910
And in fact, by watching
how people responded,

00:27:41.910 --> 00:27:43.860
you could actually gain
important information

00:27:43.860 --> 00:27:45.192
about their preferences.

00:27:45.192 --> 00:27:47.275
Monte and I don't like it
when dogs are strangled.

00:27:47.275 --> 00:27:49.460
And apparently, Anthony does.

00:27:49.460 --> 00:27:50.240
And that's OK.

00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:52.540
I'm not judging.

00:27:52.540 --> 00:27:53.841
Freak.

00:27:53.841 --> 00:27:56.200
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:56.200 --> 00:27:59.990
And so this brings us back to
the other concern about data

00:27:59.990 --> 00:28:02.370
driven programming,
that too much content

00:28:02.370 --> 00:28:05.940
is actually going to be bad
for the creative quality

00:28:05.940 --> 00:28:08.200
of the content.

00:28:08.200 --> 00:28:12.570
Again, this is a perfectly
reasonable concern given how

00:28:12.570 --> 00:28:14.070
the business has always worked.

00:28:14.070 --> 00:28:17.410
The business has always
worked sort of like football

00:28:17.410 --> 00:28:21.560
in the sense that because the
broadcast slots were limited,

00:28:21.560 --> 00:28:24.490
the show with the most
viewers was the winner.

00:28:24.490 --> 00:28:26.530
And everybody who subscribes
to Nielsen's rating

00:28:26.530 --> 00:28:28.960
knows the score
the next morning.

00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:30.870
What we're trying
to argue in the book

00:28:30.870 --> 00:28:33.300
is that Netflix and
Amazon and Google

00:28:33.300 --> 00:28:36.580
are playing by a completely
different set of rules.

00:28:36.580 --> 00:28:41.360
To win, Netflix doesn't
have to find more viewers

00:28:41.360 --> 00:28:43.760
to watch their
individual programs.

00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:46.660
Netflix wins by finding
more programs that

00:28:46.660 --> 00:28:49.680
appeal to the unique
interests and preferences

00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:51.910
of their individual viewers.

00:28:51.910 --> 00:28:56.240
And that changes everything
about how you measure quality,

00:28:56.240 --> 00:28:56.850
we argue.

00:29:00.210 --> 00:29:04.720
So, in the end, we argue
Frank Underwood was right.

00:29:04.720 --> 00:29:06.690
Power is a lot like real estate.

00:29:06.690 --> 00:29:08.530
The closer you
are to the source,

00:29:08.530 --> 00:29:11.210
the higher your property values.

00:29:11.210 --> 00:29:13.930
The problem for our
friends in Hollywood

00:29:13.930 --> 00:29:17.190
is that technology has actually
shifted the source of power

00:29:17.190 --> 00:29:20.350
in their industry and
reduced the value of many

00:29:20.350 --> 00:29:22.420
of their existing properties.

00:29:22.420 --> 00:29:25.440
As Rahul said, for
the last 100 years,

00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:27.300
the source of value
in this industry

00:29:27.300 --> 00:29:31.000
revolved around being able to
control how content was created

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:35.410
and how content was distributed,
and the scarce resources

00:29:35.410 --> 00:29:39.336
associated with how consumers
got access to the content.

00:29:39.336 --> 00:29:41.210
What we're trying
to argue in the book

00:29:41.210 --> 00:29:43.820
is that in a data driven
world, none of these assets

00:29:43.820 --> 00:29:45.990
are as scarce as they once were.

00:29:45.990 --> 00:29:49.880
The new scarce resource
is customer attention.

00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:51.860
And the new source of
power in this industry

00:29:51.860 --> 00:29:54.270
is the ability to understand
detailed information

00:29:54.270 --> 00:29:56.790
about my preferences
and then also to control

00:29:56.790 --> 00:30:00.550
the platform that allows you
to both collect that data

00:30:00.550 --> 00:30:05.490
and deliver content to me
based on my unique preferences.

00:30:05.490 --> 00:30:08.020
Make sense?

00:30:08.020 --> 00:30:08.970
All right.

00:30:08.970 --> 00:30:10.620
So our conclusion
to the question

00:30:10.620 --> 00:30:13.660
of is big data hurting the
quality of entertainment

00:30:13.660 --> 00:30:15.790
is actually quite the opposite.

00:30:15.790 --> 00:30:18.720
Big data is enhancing,
in many ways,

00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:21.190
the quality of entertainment
because it gives creators

00:30:21.190 --> 00:30:22.295
a much broader palette.

00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:27.253
This brings us to
the last point.

00:30:27.253 --> 00:30:28.140
All right.

00:30:28.140 --> 00:30:34.690
So what does this mean
to us as an audience?

00:30:34.690 --> 00:30:39.460
I think what this means is
that big data is actually

00:30:39.460 --> 00:30:44.230
going to allow us to
have content that's

00:30:44.230 --> 00:30:48.130
going to appeal to exactly
your unique needs based

00:30:48.130 --> 00:30:53.720
on your behavior, no
matter who you are.

00:30:53.720 --> 00:30:58.360
Now what does this
mean for our friends

00:30:58.360 --> 00:30:59.610
in the entertainment industry?

00:30:59.610 --> 00:31:01.300
And here, in the
spirit of talking

00:31:01.300 --> 00:31:03.810
about how we made
this book, I'll

00:31:03.810 --> 00:31:06.390
say the hardest part of
writing this book wasn't

00:31:06.390 --> 00:31:08.990
the storytelling,
as hard as that was.

00:31:08.990 --> 00:31:11.840
The hardest part of writing
this book was actually

00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:13.420
saying something
that we knew was

00:31:13.420 --> 00:31:16.260
going to be deeply offensive
to many of our friends

00:31:16.260 --> 00:31:18.570
in the entertainment industry.

00:31:18.570 --> 00:31:21.440
No one likes to hear that their
business might be in trouble

00:31:21.440 --> 00:31:25.620
or that the strategies they've
used for the last 100 years

00:31:25.620 --> 00:31:26.820
might need to change.

00:31:29.360 --> 00:31:33.550
At the same time, Rahul
and I-- at several points

00:31:33.550 --> 00:31:36.220
and using almost exactly these
words-- at several points

00:31:36.220 --> 00:31:38.020
while writing the
book, Rahul and I

00:31:38.020 --> 00:31:40.590
would come into each
other's offices and say,

00:31:40.590 --> 00:31:42.890
are you sure we really
want to say this?

00:31:42.890 --> 00:31:45.260
Wouldn't it be easier just
to keep our mouths shut,

00:31:45.260 --> 00:31:48.010
mind our own business, and
keep focusing on the research

00:31:48.010 --> 00:31:50.180
that we love doing?

00:31:50.180 --> 00:31:51.870
Ultimately, we
decided that wasn't

00:31:51.870 --> 00:31:53.430
right for a variety of reasons.

00:31:53.430 --> 00:31:55.520
Number one, as academics,
we're trained to follow

00:31:55.520 --> 00:31:56.630
wherever the data leads.

00:31:56.630 --> 00:31:58.046
And in this case,
I think the data

00:31:58.046 --> 00:32:01.690
leads to a point of
inflection in the history

00:32:01.690 --> 00:32:03.540
of the entertainment industry.

00:32:03.540 --> 00:32:07.010
Second, we're fundamentally
committed to the idea

00:32:07.010 --> 00:32:10.930
that our friends in the industry
deserve to know the truth.

00:32:10.930 --> 00:32:13.020
And so we want to
tell them that.

00:32:13.020 --> 00:32:15.320
But I think third, and
maybe most profoundly,

00:32:15.320 --> 00:32:17.770
we see this as actually
good news for people

00:32:17.770 --> 00:32:20.010
who love great entertainment.

00:32:20.010 --> 00:32:21.960
Do you want to
enable storytellers

00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:25.220
to tell great unique stories?

00:32:25.220 --> 00:32:27.214
On-demand platforms
give you an opportunity

00:32:27.214 --> 00:32:28.630
to tell stories
that just wouldn't

00:32:28.630 --> 00:32:31.700
be possible in any
traditional broadcast network.

00:32:31.700 --> 00:32:35.680
Do you want to help artists
find exactly the right audience

00:32:35.680 --> 00:32:37.100
for their content?

00:32:37.100 --> 00:32:38.550
Big data gives
you an opportunity

00:32:38.550 --> 00:32:42.140
to do that with both a precision
and a profitability that

00:32:42.140 --> 00:32:45.730
wouldn't have been possible in
any of your existing channels.

00:32:45.730 --> 00:32:49.360
And we're really optimistic
about both the future

00:32:49.360 --> 00:32:51.730
of the industry
and also the future

00:32:51.730 --> 00:32:56.991
of our friends in Hollywood
to respond to this.

00:32:56.991 --> 00:32:58.990
So that's the answer to
the first two questions.

00:32:58.990 --> 00:33:01.300
There's a third question
we talk about in the book.

00:33:01.300 --> 00:33:03.820
And that is, what can industry
leaders do to respond?

00:33:03.820 --> 00:33:05.440
Rahul and I decided not
to answer that question

00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:06.981
in this talk in the
hopes that people

00:33:06.981 --> 00:33:13.150
would have some reason to go
out and actually buy the book.

00:33:13.150 --> 00:33:17.090
So with that, I think we can
turn it over to questions.

00:33:17.090 --> 00:33:18.996
Is that what you would
like to do next, sir?

00:33:18.996 --> 00:33:20.370
AUDIENCE: I think
you should take

00:33:20.370 --> 00:33:23.120
careful note of
Hollywood's response

00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:25.570
by increasing the
diversity of their movies.

00:33:25.570 --> 00:33:28.430
It used to be it was just
one Marvel comic book

00:33:28.430 --> 00:33:29.600
after another.

00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:33.378
But now they've
added DC comic books.

00:33:33.378 --> 00:33:36.860
MICHAEL SMITH: No comment.

00:33:36.860 --> 00:33:38.050
AUDIENCE: All right.

00:33:38.050 --> 00:33:42.110
So when we look at the
streaming of music,

00:33:42.110 --> 00:33:44.090
we see multiple platforms.

00:33:44.090 --> 00:33:46.270
And loosely speaking,
the tendency

00:33:46.270 --> 00:33:50.180
is that the platforms have
pretty much everything.

00:33:50.180 --> 00:33:52.025
You can find
everything on Spotify.

00:33:52.025 --> 00:33:55.130
You can find everything
on YouTube Red.

00:33:55.130 --> 00:33:58.120
You can find everything
on Apple Music.

00:33:58.120 --> 00:33:59.250
Everything is there.

00:33:59.250 --> 00:34:05.340
When you look at movies, you
see a bunch of platforms.

00:34:05.340 --> 00:34:07.830
And you can find pretty much
nothing on each of them.

00:34:07.830 --> 00:34:12.050
OK, I'm exaggerating, but
there's a very limited set

00:34:12.050 --> 00:34:13.179
of movies on Netflix.

00:34:13.179 --> 00:34:19.449
There's a very limited set
of musics on each platform.

00:34:19.449 --> 00:34:24.060
So why do we see the
difference between music,

00:34:24.060 --> 00:34:27.500
where you get everything
at the same place,

00:34:27.500 --> 00:34:29.239
and there are multiple
places like that,

00:34:29.239 --> 00:34:33.811
and movies, where this is
very much not the case?

00:34:33.811 --> 00:34:37.377
And what does the future have
in store, if you can speculate?

00:34:37.377 --> 00:34:39.210
MICHAEL SMITH: This
count as a hard question

00:34:39.210 --> 00:34:40.940
or an easy question?

00:34:40.940 --> 00:34:43.541
RAHUL TELANG: Let me start,
and then you can come fix it.

00:34:43.541 --> 00:34:44.290
MICHAEL SMITH: OK.

00:34:44.290 --> 00:34:46.165
RAHUL TELANG: So I think
the music definitely

00:34:46.165 --> 00:34:49.072
has gone what we call the
subscription-based model.

00:34:49.072 --> 00:34:51.370
So industry, actually,
if you talk to them,

00:34:51.370 --> 00:34:53.510
they're reasonably
excited that if you're

00:34:53.510 --> 00:34:57.620
willing to pay $9.99 a month--
in a year, that turns out

00:34:57.620 --> 00:35:01.890
to be about $120-- if they
can get $120 from a consumer

00:35:01.890 --> 00:35:06.070
to listen to unlimited music,
they will be reasonably happy.

00:35:06.070 --> 00:35:08.810
Of course, the trouble
is to convert people

00:35:08.810 --> 00:35:10.870
into paying $9.99 a
month, which is really

00:35:10.870 --> 00:35:12.870
the struggle with the
Spotifys and the Apple

00:35:12.870 --> 00:35:15.160
Music and everything else.

00:35:15.160 --> 00:35:17.340
So the music labels,
then, are willing to work

00:35:17.340 --> 00:35:18.850
with the platforms
and say, OK, I

00:35:18.850 --> 00:35:21.400
can make my whole
catalog available.

00:35:21.400 --> 00:35:23.330
I think for the motion
picture industry,

00:35:23.330 --> 00:35:25.720
they still have a lot
of windowing strategies

00:35:25.720 --> 00:35:26.400
that go on.

00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:28.900
That is, they make a ton
of money selling DVDs,

00:35:28.900 --> 00:35:33.890
selling on iTunes, getting
the television audience

00:35:33.890 --> 00:35:36.280
as well as in theaters.

00:35:36.280 --> 00:35:39.800
If they make this content
available on the Netflix

00:35:39.800 --> 00:35:43.770
of the world, I think
they're not sure

00:35:43.770 --> 00:35:45.080
how they're going to monetize.

00:35:45.080 --> 00:35:46.530
They're not sure
whether that they

00:35:46.530 --> 00:35:47.946
want to move in
the business world

00:35:47.946 --> 00:35:49.390
where everything
is going to turn

00:35:49.390 --> 00:35:52.170
into movie from day
one basically becomes

00:35:52.170 --> 00:35:54.990
a subscription-based model.

00:35:54.990 --> 00:35:58.520
So, for the motion
picture industry,

00:35:58.520 --> 00:36:03.540
I think it's not going to
happen anytime soon, I believe.

00:36:03.540 --> 00:36:06.540
MICHAEL SMITH: So A
guess without data,

00:36:06.540 --> 00:36:09.230
let's imagine a world
where the heterogeneity

00:36:09.230 --> 00:36:16.220
and valuations for movies was
higher than it is for music.

00:36:16.220 --> 00:36:18.360
In that world-- and
now I'm going back

00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:21.534
to a famous book,
"Information" something.

00:36:21.534 --> 00:36:23.034
I can't remember
what it was called.

00:36:23.034 --> 00:36:24.498
AUDIENCE: "Information Shared."

00:36:24.498 --> 00:36:25.581
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:25.581 --> 00:36:27.580
MICHAEL SMITH: Where you
say bundling is optimal

00:36:27.580 --> 00:36:31.400
as long as the variance of
adding a good to the bundle

00:36:31.400 --> 00:36:33.320
doesn't increase the variance.

00:36:33.320 --> 00:36:34.930
I can imagine a
world where there's

00:36:34.930 --> 00:36:38.450
enough heterogeneity in movies
that for a lot of these movies,

00:36:38.450 --> 00:36:41.440
adding the movie to the bundle
might increase its variance.

00:36:41.440 --> 00:36:45.700
That's one potential
explanation.

00:36:45.700 --> 00:36:47.950
AUDIENCE: Sorry, I just want
to add something to this.

00:36:47.950 --> 00:36:48.585
The characteristic--

00:36:48.585 --> 00:36:50.460
MICHAEL SMITH: Since we have
the author of the book here.

00:36:50.460 --> 00:36:51.876
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
the characteristic

00:36:51.876 --> 00:36:53.490
that's interesting
is music you want

00:36:53.490 --> 00:36:55.100
to hear over and over again.

00:36:55.100 --> 00:36:56.520
I love that Norah Jones album.

00:36:56.520 --> 00:36:59.660
I want to hear it night
and day for the next month.

00:36:59.660 --> 00:37:02.140
Movies you want to see on
an occasional basis with one

00:37:02.140 --> 00:37:03.400
exception.

00:37:03.400 --> 00:37:05.544
And that is kids movies
where it's just like music.

00:37:05.544 --> 00:37:07.210
They want to see it
over and over again.

00:37:07.210 --> 00:37:13.540
And so when you look at the
actual evolution of the way

00:37:13.540 --> 00:37:15.850
DVDs worked and the
way video tapes worked,

00:37:15.850 --> 00:37:20.320
it was really the kids movies
that spawned the ownership

00:37:20.320 --> 00:37:22.930
desire because people wanted
to see it over and over again

00:37:22.930 --> 00:37:27.300
just like music.

00:37:27.300 --> 00:37:30.130
Whereas other movies tend
to have this one time

00:37:30.130 --> 00:37:33.670
is enough or two times is
enough, something of that sort.

00:37:33.670 --> 00:37:37.672
Now I don't know how that plays
into the ultimate economic

00:37:37.672 --> 00:37:39.130
structure of the
industry, but it's

00:37:39.130 --> 00:37:42.540
a very different
characteristic of the media.

00:37:42.540 --> 00:37:45.040
And I think that has something
to do with the answer

00:37:45.040 --> 00:37:46.061
to your puzzle.

00:37:46.061 --> 00:37:47.560
AUDIENCE: I think
along those lines,

00:37:47.560 --> 00:37:48.960
there's actually
films that are made

00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:50.460
for the mass audience
versus the ones that are

00:37:50.460 --> 00:37:51.668
more like a literature thing.

00:37:51.668 --> 00:37:54.880
And you want to go back to it
to enrich your experience of it

00:37:54.880 --> 00:37:56.900
again and discover new things.

00:37:56.900 --> 00:37:58.890
But I think as
far as what you're

00:37:58.890 --> 00:38:01.492
saying on the quality
of the entertainment,

00:38:01.492 --> 00:38:02.950
I think for every
"House of Cards,"

00:38:02.950 --> 00:38:04.170
you also have a "Full House."

00:38:04.170 --> 00:38:06.100
You have a "Marco Polo."

00:38:06.100 --> 00:38:08.730
You have quite a few things
that are immediately tossable.

00:38:08.730 --> 00:38:09.480
MICHAEL SMITH: Are
those positive examples

00:38:09.480 --> 00:38:10.354
or negative examples?

00:38:10.354 --> 00:38:13.310
AUDIENCE: I think they're
quite negative, actually.

00:38:13.310 --> 00:38:15.276
And a lot of it, you have data.

00:38:15.276 --> 00:38:17.650
You say that the people like
these different plot points.

00:38:17.650 --> 00:38:18.690
They like these
different elements.

00:38:18.690 --> 00:38:20.340
Those incorporate into a story.

00:38:20.340 --> 00:38:22.280
You've had this since
the Roger Corman days.

00:38:22.280 --> 00:38:24.390
You want your prison
film with the girl fight,

00:38:24.390 --> 00:38:25.770
with the guns and everything.

00:38:25.770 --> 00:38:27.610
And you make whatever you want--

00:38:27.610 --> 00:38:29.050
MICHAEL SMITH: Speak for
yourself, but go ahead.

00:38:29.050 --> 00:38:29.675
AUDIENCE: Sure.

00:38:29.675 --> 00:38:30.470
You have that.

00:38:30.470 --> 00:38:32.630
Even there's a book
from a couple years ago

00:38:32.630 --> 00:38:35.740
that was talking about
scripts for big budget films,

00:38:35.740 --> 00:38:39.380
"The Dark Knight" and the
second Star Trek movie

00:38:39.380 --> 00:38:40.900
were made from the same thing.

00:38:40.900 --> 00:38:43.334
One had a good execution,
one not so good.

00:38:43.334 --> 00:38:44.500
People didn't respond to it.

00:38:44.500 --> 00:38:47.520
They do the same plot points
at the same beats in the movie.

00:38:47.520 --> 00:38:50.530
If you time them,
they're roughly a bad guy

00:38:50.530 --> 00:38:52.795
gets captured, bad
guy gets let go.

00:38:52.795 --> 00:38:54.920
They're doing these things
at the exact same times,

00:38:54.920 --> 00:38:58.090
except one does it well,
one doesn't do it so well.

00:38:58.090 --> 00:39:00.417
So there is artistry to allow
for with the data points.

00:39:00.417 --> 00:39:01.500
MICHAEL SMITH: No, no, no.

00:39:01.500 --> 00:39:04.710
And again, we're not claiming
that the artistry goes away.

00:39:04.710 --> 00:39:07.770
I think all we're claiming
is that you can do things

00:39:07.770 --> 00:39:12.140
profitably in an on-demand
platform that wouldn't be

00:39:12.140 --> 00:39:15.440
profitable in a la carte sales.

00:39:15.440 --> 00:39:16.490
But go ahead.

00:39:16.490 --> 00:39:18.200
AUDIENCE: Sure, but
along those lines,

00:39:18.200 --> 00:39:20.170
are you also
considering the fact

00:39:20.170 --> 00:39:23.484
that for the television
environment, the theater

00:39:23.484 --> 00:39:24.900
environment you
have to allot time

00:39:24.900 --> 00:39:30.144
for the next showing, the
commercials, the trailers.

00:39:30.144 --> 00:39:31.560
Online, you don't
have to do that.

00:39:31.560 --> 00:39:34.430
So it's also allowing
for a longer time

00:39:34.430 --> 00:39:37.260
to tell a story can
make those better

00:39:37.260 --> 00:39:39.610
stories even more better.

00:39:39.610 --> 00:39:42.330
But the garbage shows,
they kind of just

00:39:42.330 --> 00:39:45.195
stick around a
little bit longer.

00:39:45.195 --> 00:39:47.320
MICHAEL SMITH: Again, I
would go back to the notion

00:39:47.320 --> 00:39:48.360
that-- you are absolutely right.

00:39:48.360 --> 00:39:50.119
In a world where I
don't have commercials,

00:39:50.119 --> 00:39:51.660
in a world where I
don't have to wait

00:39:51.660 --> 00:39:54.830
a week to see the next
episode, I can do stuff.

00:39:54.830 --> 00:39:58.250
I can make stuff work that
wouldn't work in broadcast.

00:39:58.250 --> 00:40:01.860
To me, "Arrested Development"
is the classic example of this.

00:40:01.860 --> 00:40:04.810
If you fell into
"Arrested Development"

00:40:04.810 --> 00:40:08.650
season 3, episode 5, you would
have no idea what's going on.

00:40:08.650 --> 00:40:12.750
The show only makes sense if you
can go back and get caught up.

00:40:12.750 --> 00:40:15.720
"Stranger Things"
is another example.

00:40:15.720 --> 00:40:19.050
It makes sense because
you can binge it.

00:40:19.050 --> 00:40:21.440
So it's not, in a
sense, that Hollywood

00:40:21.440 --> 00:40:23.620
lost their creative mojo.

00:40:23.620 --> 00:40:27.520
It's just that, again, the
new on-demand platforms

00:40:27.520 --> 00:40:29.870
allow you to do stuff
that you just couldn't do

00:40:29.870 --> 00:40:32.330
in a traditional broadcast way.

00:40:32.330 --> 00:40:35.710
But execution, creativity is
absolutely still important.

00:40:35.710 --> 00:40:37.040
There's no doubt about that.

00:40:37.040 --> 00:40:39.840
Did that sort of
answer your question?

00:40:39.840 --> 00:40:40.540
MICHAEL SMITH: Do you
want to jump in on this?

00:40:40.540 --> 00:40:41.720
RAHUL TELANG: I'm just
saying just because you

00:40:41.720 --> 00:40:43.145
have data doesn't
mean that you'll

00:40:43.145 --> 00:40:45.230
end up making better shows.

00:40:45.230 --> 00:40:48.170
I mean, at some
level, the talent that

00:40:48.170 --> 00:40:50.970
is available to the Netflix
in terms of creative

00:40:50.970 --> 00:40:52.450
is the same talent,
to an extent,

00:40:52.450 --> 00:40:54.670
available to sometimes
the large Hollywood

00:40:54.670 --> 00:40:56.740
studio, except that
maybe Netflix has

00:40:56.740 --> 00:40:59.230
these other advantages,
that is it doesn't have

00:40:59.230 --> 00:41:03.570
to be a linear story from
9:00 to 9:45, take a break,

00:41:03.570 --> 00:41:04.790
then come back.

00:41:04.790 --> 00:41:08.810
Whereas in the Netflix, you
could have 20 hours of show

00:41:08.810 --> 00:41:11.580
in mind versus a
chunk of 45 minutes.

00:41:11.580 --> 00:41:14.240
That also probably makes
it more enriching, maybe,

00:41:14.240 --> 00:41:17.900
to the creator if you
have, again, people who

00:41:17.900 --> 00:41:18.980
can make good stories.

00:41:18.980 --> 00:41:20.975
Of course, I mean, if
you have poor execution,

00:41:20.975 --> 00:41:22.760
it doesn't matter what you have.

00:41:22.760 --> 00:41:26.436
So, as I said, in baseball, if
you have access to good data,

00:41:26.436 --> 00:41:28.560
it doesn't mean that you
can make a better picture.

00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:30.250
The picture is still going
to be the same picture.

00:41:30.250 --> 00:41:31.750
But if you have
access to good data,

00:41:31.750 --> 00:41:33.640
maybe you can
identify the talent

00:41:33.640 --> 00:41:36.600
and then nurture the talent
and then promote and support

00:41:36.600 --> 00:41:38.587
that talent, I think.

00:41:38.587 --> 00:41:40.420
MICHAEL SMITH: Maybe
another way to describe

00:41:40.420 --> 00:41:43.710
this is, why did
Netflix sign Adam

00:41:43.710 --> 00:41:46.840
Sandler to a five-movie deal?

00:41:46.840 --> 00:41:49.500
And why did Amazon
sign Woody Allen

00:41:49.500 --> 00:41:51.800
to write a television show?

00:41:51.800 --> 00:41:54.510
I think you could make an
argument that both Adam Sandler

00:41:54.510 --> 00:41:58.580
and Woody Allen are niche
tastes, acquired tastes.

00:41:58.580 --> 00:42:02.260
So why might they work
for Netflix and Amazon

00:42:02.260 --> 00:42:04.350
not for anybody in the
traditional industry?

00:42:04.350 --> 00:42:06.900
Because Netflix and Amazon know
exactly who the Woody Allen

00:42:06.900 --> 00:42:09.800
fans are and exactly-- I'll
point at Hal-- exactly who

00:42:09.800 --> 00:42:14.040
the Adam Sandler fans are.

00:42:14.040 --> 00:42:16.590
And they can promote
that content to them

00:42:16.590 --> 00:42:17.790
much more efficiently.

00:42:17.790 --> 00:42:19.990
And at least by all
public announcements,

00:42:19.990 --> 00:42:23.570
Netflix is arguing that its
Adam Sandler creations have been

00:42:23.570 --> 00:42:24.864
a huge hit for the platform.

00:42:24.864 --> 00:42:26.530
AUDIENCE: So, I guess,
what do you think

00:42:26.530 --> 00:42:30.080
about the recommendation
systems and the black hole

00:42:30.080 --> 00:42:32.330
sort of thing, where I
discover you like peanut butter

00:42:32.330 --> 00:42:33.746
and jelly sandwiches,
so I'm going

00:42:33.746 --> 00:42:36.190
to give you all these variants
of peanut butter and jelly.

00:42:36.190 --> 00:42:38.106
You don't like peanut
butter and jelly anymore

00:42:38.106 --> 00:42:41.260
because I inundated you with
peanut butter and jelly.

00:42:41.260 --> 00:42:44.280
What do you think is the danger
there with data-based story

00:42:44.280 --> 00:42:44.780
telling?

00:42:44.780 --> 00:42:46.655
RAHUL TELANG: So I'll
give one quick example.

00:42:46.655 --> 00:42:48.880
I was reading--
actually, a reporter

00:42:48.880 --> 00:42:51.020
was asking me about it,
so it came to my mind.

00:42:51.020 --> 00:42:54.287
So apparently Spotify runs--
I am not a Spotify subscriber,

00:42:54.287 --> 00:42:56.120
so I don't know all the
details, but Spotify

00:42:56.120 --> 00:42:58.277
has this-- what-- Discover
Playlist or something?

00:42:58.277 --> 00:42:59.110
MICHAEL SMITH: Yeah.

00:42:59.110 --> 00:43:01.480
RAHUL TELANG: So, apparently,
this Discover Playlist

00:43:01.480 --> 00:43:03.690
on Spotify is widely popular.

00:43:03.690 --> 00:43:05.149
People love the
Discover Playlist.

00:43:05.149 --> 00:43:07.190
And I was actually reading
a little bit about it.

00:43:07.190 --> 00:43:11.560
What it is-- and it was nothing
but a recommendation system

00:43:11.560 --> 00:43:14.090
to figure out what
songs people love.

00:43:14.090 --> 00:43:17.450
And this, to my-- I guess
I shouldn't be surprised,

00:43:17.450 --> 00:43:19.870
I'm from Carnegie Mellon--
the recommendation system is

00:43:19.870 --> 00:43:21.770
basically built on
this deep machine

00:43:21.770 --> 00:43:24.650
learning, the deep learning
theory of machine learning.

00:43:24.650 --> 00:43:29.270
And I said, could it offer
you a bad recommendation?

00:43:29.270 --> 00:43:31.410
Of course, it could offer
you a bad recommendation.

00:43:31.410 --> 00:43:35.950
But it seems like our
data analytics is getting

00:43:35.950 --> 00:43:37.350
more and more sophisticated.

00:43:37.350 --> 00:43:39.740
And new ones that,
more likely than not,

00:43:39.740 --> 00:43:43.030
it is actually going to delight
users rather than disappoint

00:43:43.030 --> 00:43:44.190
users.

00:43:44.190 --> 00:43:46.230
Even with our
recommendation engine,

00:43:46.230 --> 00:43:50.170
human recommendations also
have significant amount

00:43:50.170 --> 00:43:52.030
of bad hit rate.

00:43:52.030 --> 00:43:55.310
So at some level, we're
comparing the world

00:43:55.310 --> 00:43:59.580
before the engine versus after
these engines came about.

00:43:59.580 --> 00:44:04.390
And I actually feel that most of
the people are actually happy.

00:44:04.390 --> 00:44:08.050
And they'll get even
better with time

00:44:08.050 --> 00:44:12.706
rather than relying on human
curators who are probably as

00:44:12.706 --> 00:44:15.650
crappy as we expect them to be.

00:44:15.650 --> 00:44:17.670
MICHAEL SMITH: Well,
I would actually use--

00:44:17.670 --> 00:44:19.670
and hopefully this won't
be pandering to anybody

00:44:19.670 --> 00:44:21.960
in the audience-- but
my favorite example I

00:44:21.960 --> 00:44:25.090
use in class is just to take a
screenshot of my YouTube front

00:44:25.090 --> 00:44:26.150
page.

00:44:26.150 --> 00:44:28.420
You've got Rolling Stones clips.

00:44:28.420 --> 00:44:30.370
You've got baseball highlights.

00:44:30.370 --> 00:44:32.950
You've got "West
Wing" episode clips.

00:44:32.950 --> 00:44:35.620
I mean, you guys do
an amazingly good job

00:44:35.620 --> 00:44:37.830
of presenting me with
16 different clips

00:44:37.830 --> 00:44:41.751
that I can easily waste 45
minutes on just exploring

00:44:41.751 --> 00:44:42.250
around.

00:44:42.250 --> 00:44:45.580
And I think being
able to say, here

00:44:45.580 --> 00:44:47.076
are a bunch of
recommendations, it

00:44:47.076 --> 00:44:49.200
looks like Mike isn't
clicking on the peanut butter

00:44:49.200 --> 00:44:50.870
and jelly ones as
much as he once

00:44:50.870 --> 00:44:54.290
did, let's transition to
something new, I think

00:44:54.290 --> 00:44:56.190
is actually pretty
darn powerful.

00:44:56.190 --> 00:44:59.760
And I think you guys actually do
an amazingly good job at that.

00:44:59.760 --> 00:45:00.710
And thank you.

00:45:00.710 --> 00:45:02.740
AUDIENCE: He's discovered
his Google profile.

00:45:02.740 --> 00:45:02.890
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:02.890 --> 00:45:04.098
MICHAEL SMITH: Yeah, exactly.

00:45:06.690 --> 00:45:08.017
Question from a former student.

00:45:08.017 --> 00:45:08.600
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:45:08.600 --> 00:45:08.920
MICHAEL SMITH: I hear you.

00:45:08.920 --> 00:45:10.570
AUDIENCE: I studied
[INAUDIBLE] so I

00:45:10.570 --> 00:45:14.250
like to ask you a question.

00:45:14.250 --> 00:45:17.070
So it seems like there's
some sort of a war going on,

00:45:17.070 --> 00:45:21.499
like a battle going on between
the incumbent entertainment

00:45:21.499 --> 00:45:23.707
players versus the ones that
are already established.

00:45:26.266 --> 00:45:27.640
Who do you think
is going to win?

00:45:27.640 --> 00:45:30.680
Or where do you think
is the stabilization

00:45:30.680 --> 00:45:33.422
point between this?

00:45:33.422 --> 00:45:35.130
MICHAEL SMITH: You
want to take this one?

00:45:35.130 --> 00:45:37.338
RAHUL TELANG: I don't know
if there's a war going on,

00:45:37.338 --> 00:45:40.740
but I would say that the
traditional players are not

00:45:40.740 --> 00:45:46.200
used to an entry from basically
a technology start-up who

00:45:46.200 --> 00:45:47.550
used to be just a distributor.

00:45:47.550 --> 00:45:49.450
I mean, it was a
DVD distributor--

00:45:49.450 --> 00:45:51.344
that's what Netflix
was-- and then became

00:45:51.344 --> 00:45:52.510
a distributor for streaming.

00:45:52.510 --> 00:45:56.250
And now it realized
that it can actually

00:45:56.250 --> 00:45:58.600
do a pretty good job
of creating content

00:45:58.600 --> 00:46:04.750
and just make vertically
integrated, all in one shop.

00:46:04.750 --> 00:46:07.820
Now who is going to win?

00:46:07.820 --> 00:46:10.906
The ground fact is that I
think some of the things

00:46:10.906 --> 00:46:12.280
that we mention
in the book, that

00:46:12.280 --> 00:46:16.290
is having access to audience,
having this huge customer base,

00:46:16.290 --> 00:46:19.200
having ability to
identify their interests,

00:46:19.200 --> 00:46:22.380
I think they are going to play
an increasingly important role

00:46:22.380 --> 00:46:25.100
in giving you a
competitive advantage.

00:46:25.100 --> 00:46:30.050
Could the traditional players
be able to acquire those?

00:46:30.050 --> 00:46:30.550
Of course.

00:46:30.550 --> 00:46:31.949
I mean, they have
deep experience

00:46:31.949 --> 00:46:33.740
in building very good
content as you meant.

00:46:33.740 --> 00:46:37.140
They make those
interesting stories.

00:46:37.140 --> 00:46:40.010
They have access to some
of their own platform.

00:46:40.010 --> 00:46:41.690
They can actually
negotiate quite hard.

00:46:41.690 --> 00:46:43.981
I think one other thing that
we didn't have enough time

00:46:43.981 --> 00:46:46.410
to talk about is that a lot
of these online platforms

00:46:46.410 --> 00:46:48.990
actually share no
data with them.

00:46:48.990 --> 00:46:50.365
Some [INAUDIBLE]
because it never

00:46:50.365 --> 00:46:52.114
occurred to them that
they should actually

00:46:52.114 --> 00:46:52.920
ask for that data.

00:46:52.920 --> 00:46:54.940
They don't have the
right sort of skills.

00:46:54.940 --> 00:46:57.610
But I think there is a
possibility that maybe it

00:46:57.610 --> 00:47:00.440
will go in that direction where
these companies will also say,

00:47:00.440 --> 00:47:04.480
I can also use some of these
skills that these forms have

00:47:04.480 --> 00:47:08.050
and build some of that
into my business model.

00:47:08.050 --> 00:47:10.500
So I don't know who is
going to be the winner.

00:47:10.500 --> 00:47:12.610
Maybe there are going
to be some mergers.

00:47:12.610 --> 00:47:13.150
Who knows?

00:47:13.150 --> 00:47:14.750
I mean, that's
really harder to say.

00:47:14.750 --> 00:47:16.750
Maybe Mike can look in
the future better than I.

00:47:16.750 --> 00:47:19.720
MICHAEL SMITH: No, I was going
to say something very similar.

00:47:19.720 --> 00:47:21.520
Going back to "The
Perfect Storm" analogy,

00:47:21.520 --> 00:47:24.599
we all know how the book ends.

00:47:24.599 --> 00:47:25.890
Well, I won't spoil it for you.

00:47:28.950 --> 00:47:32.980
I think we're not saying
that's the preordained outcome

00:47:32.980 --> 00:47:36.060
for the traditional
people in the industry.

00:47:36.060 --> 00:47:39.220
In fact, in Hollywood,
it would be really cool

00:47:39.220 --> 00:47:41.980
if they had an independent
digital distribution

00:47:41.980 --> 00:47:45.999
platform that received funding
from the studios that created--

00:47:45.999 --> 00:47:47.540
and hopefully by
now you've picked up

00:47:47.540 --> 00:47:48.750
that I'm talking about Hulu.

00:47:48.750 --> 00:47:50.181
RAHUL TELANG: Gee.

00:47:50.181 --> 00:47:51.680
MICHAEL SMITH: I
think they actually

00:47:51.680 --> 00:47:54.200
have some pretty
interesting assets

00:47:54.200 --> 00:47:56.310
they can bring to bear on this.

00:47:56.310 --> 00:47:57.649
So who wins?

00:47:57.649 --> 00:47:58.190
I don't know.

00:47:58.190 --> 00:48:00.970
But I think this is a
very interesting battle.

00:48:00.970 --> 00:48:05.220
I don't think it's obvious one
side wins and the other side

00:48:05.220 --> 00:48:06.370
loses.

00:48:06.370 --> 00:48:08.750
In the end, I think
consumers win.

00:48:08.750 --> 00:48:11.550
And that's the dog
slide at the end.

00:48:11.550 --> 00:48:13.050
AUDIENCE: Just a
follow-up question.

00:48:13.050 --> 00:48:16.430
Have you heard back from
any of your counterparts

00:48:16.430 --> 00:48:19.080
in the industry about what
their reaction to the book is?

00:48:19.080 --> 00:48:21.520
And do they feel threatened?

00:48:21.520 --> 00:48:23.900
Do they feel excited about
the changes there are?

00:48:23.900 --> 00:48:25.483
MICHAEL SMITH: Depends
on who you ask.

00:48:25.483 --> 00:48:26.170
RAHUL TELANG: That's right.

00:48:26.170 --> 00:48:28.270
MICHAEL SMITH: I will
say we've presented this

00:48:28.270 --> 00:48:30.340
to three of the six studios.

00:48:30.340 --> 00:48:33.770
And we're presenting
to two more tomorrow.

00:48:33.770 --> 00:48:36.770
And in fact, we've received
really good feedback

00:48:36.770 --> 00:48:41.480
on what we're
saying in the book.

00:48:41.480 --> 00:48:44.970
I think they're much more
receptive to this message

00:48:44.970 --> 00:48:48.360
than a lot of people outside
the industry would suspect.

00:48:48.360 --> 00:48:50.350
I think the other
thing that we've

00:48:50.350 --> 00:48:52.310
recognized working
with the studios,

00:48:52.310 --> 00:48:55.940
that the studios are not
monolithic in any sense.

00:48:55.940 --> 00:48:58.560
If you ask five people
in a studio what

00:48:58.560 --> 00:49:00.610
they think their digital
strategy ought to be,

00:49:00.610 --> 00:49:04.210
you're going to get
seven different answers.

00:49:04.210 --> 00:49:08.850
There is a strong debate within
the entertainment industry

00:49:08.850 --> 00:49:11.742
today, internally, about
what should we be doing.

00:49:11.742 --> 00:49:13.200
And again, a big
part of the reason

00:49:13.200 --> 00:49:14.616
we wanted to write
this book is we

00:49:14.616 --> 00:49:16.600
wanted to give a different
perspective on why

00:49:16.600 --> 00:49:19.632
this is something where
you should move right now.

00:49:19.632 --> 00:49:22.090
RAHUL TELANG: When you get a
speaker from Amazon and Google

00:49:22.090 --> 00:49:24.270
come and talk in the
class in the university,

00:49:24.270 --> 00:49:26.260
every time you hear
is that every decision

00:49:26.260 --> 00:49:28.670
is done made from data.

00:49:28.670 --> 00:49:30.310
No matter how trivial
the decision is,

00:49:30.310 --> 00:49:31.245
we are going to
do an A/B testing.

00:49:31.245 --> 00:49:32.300
We are going to do this.

00:49:32.300 --> 00:49:33.640
We are going to do that.

00:49:33.640 --> 00:49:35.150
And then you move
into this world

00:49:35.150 --> 00:49:37.030
where a lot of these
decisions are actually

00:49:37.030 --> 00:49:40.450
not based on serious data.

00:49:40.450 --> 00:49:42.750
It's based on this
is how we did things.

00:49:42.750 --> 00:49:44.830
This is how things work.

00:49:44.830 --> 00:49:47.350
That culture, I think,
probably will change.

00:49:47.350 --> 00:49:50.330
I think increasingly
the firms, they're

00:49:50.330 --> 00:49:52.970
already realizing just hiring
the right sort of talent

00:49:52.970 --> 00:49:58.290
and making sure that the data--
it's a lot of cultural change.

00:49:58.290 --> 00:50:01.404
I'm pretty sure that that
change will take place.

00:50:01.404 --> 00:50:03.320
Well, whether that's
going to be enough or not

00:50:03.320 --> 00:50:05.760
is anybody's guess.

00:50:05.760 --> 00:50:08.060
AUDIENCE: So you
could phrase the thing

00:50:08.060 --> 00:50:10.400
that Rahul was talking
earlier about the distribution

00:50:10.400 --> 00:50:12.880
being a really inefficient
thing, that then we

00:50:12.880 --> 00:50:15.400
had technology that could
overcome that, technology that

00:50:15.400 --> 00:50:17.290
could give a better product.

00:50:17.290 --> 00:50:19.010
There's a gap that
existed there.

00:50:19.010 --> 00:50:21.600
There's a gap between what was
possible and what was provided.

00:50:21.600 --> 00:50:23.120
Do you see there's still a gap?

00:50:23.120 --> 00:50:24.790
Have we gotten as
far as we can go?

00:50:24.790 --> 00:50:27.889
Or are there other-- rather
than just-- are we just

00:50:27.889 --> 00:50:29.430
tipping the balance
further from here

00:50:29.430 --> 00:50:31.620
on in of the same kind of stuff?

00:50:31.620 --> 00:50:33.860
Or is there something
different to come?

00:50:33.860 --> 00:50:36.140
Is there still a gap
between what we can do now

00:50:36.140 --> 00:50:37.500
and what is happening?

00:50:37.500 --> 00:50:40.400
RAHUL TELANG: So did you mean
in terms of distribution?

00:50:40.400 --> 00:50:41.700
I wasn't clear.

00:50:41.700 --> 00:50:43.690
AUDIENCE: I was generalizing
from distribution

00:50:43.690 --> 00:50:46.739
in terms of anything
that's possible now.

00:50:46.739 --> 00:50:48.280
Is there still things
that technology

00:50:48.280 --> 00:50:51.530
can do that the movie
industry hasn't leveraged,

00:50:51.530 --> 00:50:52.530
that Netflix doesn't do.

00:50:52.530 --> 00:50:54.820
Netflix has to go into
a new way of dealing

00:50:54.820 --> 00:50:56.244
that it doesn't do yet.

00:50:56.244 --> 00:50:57.910
MICHAEL SMITH: I know
the answer is yes.

00:50:57.910 --> 00:50:59.240
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:59.240 --> 00:51:00.522
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:51:00.522 --> 00:51:01.480
MICHAEL SMITH: I mean--

00:51:01.480 --> 00:51:02.480
AUDIENCE: Can you see a gap?

00:51:02.480 --> 00:51:03.690
Can you see anything
that you're like,

00:51:03.690 --> 00:51:05.148
oh, I wish they
would fix that or--

00:51:05.148 --> 00:51:08.220
RAHUL TELANG: I feel
like the technology--

00:51:08.220 --> 00:51:11.460
there's one aspect, whether
the technology makes

00:51:11.460 --> 00:51:12.650
a lot of things possible.

00:51:12.650 --> 00:51:14.180
What the challenge
comes is what is

00:51:14.180 --> 00:51:16.200
the business model
behind the technology

00:51:16.200 --> 00:51:17.180
that I can make money?

00:51:17.180 --> 00:51:18.700
I mean, technology
makes it possible

00:51:18.700 --> 00:51:21.470
that I can make the movie
available on streaming

00:51:21.470 --> 00:51:23.150
platform on day one.

00:51:23.150 --> 00:51:24.650
There is enough
bandwidth available.

00:51:24.650 --> 00:51:26.880
There is enough storage
available, all the devices.

00:51:26.880 --> 00:51:28.360
That's possible.

00:51:28.360 --> 00:51:30.960
But there is no
business model that

00:51:30.960 --> 00:51:35.180
will allow the firms to say,
can I profitably do that

00:51:35.180 --> 00:51:39.410
so that I can actually
recover my investment back?

00:51:39.410 --> 00:51:42.420
So the engineers will keep
developing all of these--

00:51:42.420 --> 00:51:45.050
how to distribute better, how
to distribute more efficiently,

00:51:45.050 --> 00:51:46.740
how to lower the
cost of production.

00:51:46.740 --> 00:51:50.011
But then can we have the
business model that allows--

00:51:50.011 --> 00:51:51.760
AUDIENCE: That's kind
of like more faster.

00:51:51.760 --> 00:51:52.930
And that'll keep happening.

00:51:52.930 --> 00:51:53.980
Is that the--

00:51:53.980 --> 00:51:55.440
RAHUL TELANG:
Cheaper and faster.

00:51:55.440 --> 00:51:55.690
AUDIENCE: Cheaper, faster.

00:51:55.690 --> 00:51:57.860
RAHUL TELANG: I think that,
for sure, but as I said,

00:51:57.860 --> 00:52:00.261
what is the business
model on the top of it?

00:52:00.261 --> 00:52:01.760
AUDIENCE: I guess
the transformation

00:52:01.760 --> 00:52:04.940
is that we don't watch the
TV show on the first day it

00:52:04.940 --> 00:52:05.870
comes out anymore.

00:52:05.870 --> 00:52:08.456
I started "House of Cards"
probably four months

00:52:08.456 --> 00:52:11.080
after the first release because
I just didn't get around to it.

00:52:11.080 --> 00:52:13.700
And then I watched
the whole thing.

00:52:13.700 --> 00:52:17.220
That's like a change in
the style of consuming.

00:52:17.220 --> 00:52:18.600
Is there more style changes?

00:52:18.600 --> 00:52:20.680
Or is it just more faster then?

00:52:20.680 --> 00:52:22.180
MICHAEL SMITH: No,
I think there are

00:52:22.180 --> 00:52:25.970
plenty of really interesting
style changes just like that.

00:52:25.970 --> 00:52:28.310
that the audience can
watch it in different ways.

00:52:28.310 --> 00:52:29.770
And that enables
the storytellers

00:52:29.770 --> 00:52:31.936
to tell different stories
that wouldn't have worked.

00:52:31.936 --> 00:52:33.840
And there's this
wonderful feedback loop

00:52:33.840 --> 00:52:36.610
of all sorts of really
cool innovation.

00:52:36.610 --> 00:52:40.660
I think the other thing we're
seeing is a shift from, again,

00:52:40.660 --> 00:52:45.650
when channels are scarce you've
got to have a system that says,

00:52:45.650 --> 00:52:49.520
I'm going to choose what gets
made before it gets made.

00:52:49.520 --> 00:52:52.420
I'm going to have
this choke point.

00:52:52.420 --> 00:52:53.294
It's not arbitrary.

00:52:53.294 --> 00:52:55.710
It's that I can only distribute
a certain amount of stuff.

00:52:55.710 --> 00:52:57.320
So somebody's got to choose.

00:52:57.320 --> 00:52:59.780
One of the wonderful
things about having

00:52:59.780 --> 00:53:01.800
an abundance in
distribution is that you

00:53:01.800 --> 00:53:04.470
can let everything get made
and then on the back end

00:53:04.470 --> 00:53:06.270
see what works.

00:53:06.270 --> 00:53:10.220
My daughter loves watching
videos of other people playing

00:53:10.220 --> 00:53:12.560
Minecraft on YouTube.

00:53:12.560 --> 00:53:17.100
It's not obvious that's
a good idea-- ex-ante.

00:53:17.100 --> 00:53:20.690
But it clearly delivers
a lot of value for her.

00:53:20.690 --> 00:53:21.810
And that's OK.

00:53:21.810 --> 00:53:24.223
As economists we don't judge.

00:53:24.223 --> 00:53:25.306
AUDIENCE: But as a parent.

00:53:25.306 --> 00:53:26.180
[LAUGHTER]

00:53:27.030 --> 00:53:28.830
MICHAEL SMITH: Fair point.

00:53:28.830 --> 00:53:31.590
RAHUL TELANG: He said, who
is going to be the winner?

00:53:31.590 --> 00:53:36.620
I mean, if you look at Netflix,
because of the technology,

00:53:36.620 --> 00:53:39.470
it's easier for them to be
able to offer these shows

00:53:39.470 --> 00:53:40.770
where you can do binge watch.

00:53:40.770 --> 00:53:44.580
On a television, that's
just much harder to do that.

00:53:44.580 --> 00:53:48.160
Now the Netflix of this worlds
are also changing expectations

00:53:48.160 --> 00:53:51.290
from people about what is
the demand in the content?

00:53:51.290 --> 00:53:54.390
Now you ask a 21-year-old
or 18-year-old,

00:53:54.390 --> 00:53:56.120
I mean, for them,
this idea that I'm

00:53:56.120 --> 00:53:58.730
going to watch an
episode from 9:00 to 9:45

00:53:58.730 --> 00:54:01.540
every Thursday, that
just doesn't, I think,

00:54:01.540 --> 00:54:02.990
appeal to them.

00:54:02.990 --> 00:54:05.910
They want it when they want
it at their convenience,

00:54:05.910 --> 00:54:07.160
maybe watch the whole thing.

00:54:07.160 --> 00:54:09.410
And now you can see that
the Netflix platform

00:54:09.410 --> 00:54:10.760
offers that opportunity.

00:54:10.760 --> 00:54:13.550
It gives them that
feature that, again,

00:54:13.550 --> 00:54:16.220
a linear television probably
doesn't give them a feature.

00:54:16.220 --> 00:54:18.000
So if they have to
choose between the two,

00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:20.910
they say, well, then I would
become a Netflix customer

00:54:20.910 --> 00:54:23.970
because Netflix gives me this
tremendous flexibility that I

00:54:23.970 --> 00:54:26.530
can't get on my Comcast
cable connection,

00:54:26.530 --> 00:54:28.420
for example, at least right now.

00:54:28.420 --> 00:54:33.026
So I think that's another
element to this competition.

00:54:33.026 --> 00:54:34.026
AUDIENCE: Last question.

00:54:34.026 --> 00:54:34.651
AUDIENCE: Sure.

00:54:34.651 --> 00:54:36.885
I guess building on
his thing is, well,

00:54:36.885 --> 00:54:38.510
actually a number of
years ago, my wife

00:54:38.510 --> 00:54:41.059
found this film that was
like audience participation,

00:54:41.059 --> 00:54:42.600
choose your own
adventure thing where

00:54:42.600 --> 00:54:45.350
the audience voted where they
wanted the next scene to go.

00:54:45.350 --> 00:54:47.290
So why aren't
technology companies

00:54:47.290 --> 00:54:49.570
doing that type of thing
with their platforms?

00:54:49.570 --> 00:54:51.620
They seem to have the
ability to do that.

00:54:51.620 --> 00:54:53.695
You're tapped into
everybody's UIs.

00:54:53.695 --> 00:54:55.820
You can say, I want the
next branch to go this way.

00:54:55.820 --> 00:54:57.910
I want the next
branch to go that way.

00:54:57.910 --> 00:54:59.555
AUDIENCE: They're called games.

00:54:59.555 --> 00:54:59.980
RAHUL TELANG: What?

00:54:59.980 --> 00:55:01.271
AUDIENCE: They're called games.

00:55:01.341 --> 00:55:02.840
MICHAEL SMITH: Well,
actually, I was

00:55:02.840 --> 00:55:04.131
going in a different direction.

00:55:04.131 --> 00:55:06.360
I was thinking "Epic
Rap Battles of History."

00:55:06.360 --> 00:55:08.630
Have you have you seen this?

00:55:08.630 --> 00:55:10.500
AUDIENCE: Well, you
can vote, like who won.

00:55:10.500 --> 00:55:11.830
MICHAEL SMITH: You can vote.

00:55:11.830 --> 00:55:14.419
AUDIENCE: But you don't, really,
at least from my experience,

00:55:14.419 --> 00:55:16.710
I don't think you chain on
to the next and follow that.

00:55:16.710 --> 00:55:17.100
Or do you?

00:55:17.100 --> 00:55:18.090
MICHAEL SMITH: That's fair.

00:55:18.090 --> 00:55:19.430
That might be the next thing.

00:55:19.430 --> 00:55:20.603
RAHUL TELANG: I forget now.

00:55:20.603 --> 00:55:21.186
It escapes me.

00:55:21.186 --> 00:55:24.530
Wasn't there an ABC
show which actually had

00:55:24.530 --> 00:55:27.217
people can send their
stories and that--

00:55:27.217 --> 00:55:28.050
MICHAEL SMITH: Yeah.

00:55:28.050 --> 00:55:29.758
RAHUL TELANG: And I
think-- I forget it--

00:55:29.758 --> 00:55:32.150
I think it actually
got entangled

00:55:32.150 --> 00:55:34.252
into some sort of
a copyright issue

00:55:34.252 --> 00:55:37.690
where I think the Writers
Association or something said

00:55:37.690 --> 00:55:41.290
you can't really have people
who are not part of the Writers

00:55:41.290 --> 00:55:45.230
Association send the stories
that become part of the net.

00:55:45.230 --> 00:55:47.530
So I'm blanking
on it, but I think

00:55:47.530 --> 00:55:51.750
I had this weird angle to this
whole user-generated content

00:55:51.750 --> 00:55:53.020
going back into the show.

00:55:53.020 --> 00:55:56.840
There was this somewhat
of a bizarre friction.

00:55:56.840 --> 00:55:59.501
And then I think the whole show
then eventually got canceled,

00:55:59.501 --> 00:56:00.000
I believe.

00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:00.490
I forget.

00:56:00.490 --> 00:56:02.240
MICHAEL SMITH: It was
"In the Motherhood."

00:56:02.240 --> 00:56:03.870
It was this series
a webisodes where

00:56:03.870 --> 00:56:07.050
parents would write in their
most embarrassing child

00:56:07.050 --> 00:56:08.920
stories.

00:56:08.920 --> 00:56:12.320
And then they would create
a webisode around this.

00:56:12.320 --> 00:56:13.680
And I forgot who bought it.

00:56:13.680 --> 00:56:14.620
I think it was ABC--

00:56:14.620 --> 00:56:15.480
RAHUL TELANG: Yeah,
something like that.

00:56:15.480 --> 00:56:16.938
MICHAEL SMITH:
--bought the rights.

00:56:16.938 --> 00:56:19.740
And then as soon as people
started sending in their ideas,

00:56:19.740 --> 00:56:22.570
the Writers Guild came
in and said, that's fine,

00:56:22.570 --> 00:56:25.460
but you've got to pay each
idea that comes in $1,000

00:56:25.460 --> 00:56:29.534
because that's the Guild
minimum for writing.

00:56:29.534 --> 00:56:30.950
So, again, all
that to say there's

00:56:30.950 --> 00:56:32.980
a lot of existing
structures that

00:56:32.980 --> 00:56:35.620
get in the way of innovation.

00:56:35.620 --> 00:56:37.230
But there's also a
whole lot of value

00:56:37.230 --> 00:56:40.840
you could create by doing
some of these innovations.

00:56:40.840 --> 00:56:41.840
AUDIENCE: OK, thank you.

00:56:41.840 --> 00:56:42.140
RAHUL TELANG: Thank you.

00:56:42.140 --> 00:56:43.181
MICHAEL SMITH: Thank you.

00:56:43.181 --> 00:56:45.190
[APPLAUSE]
