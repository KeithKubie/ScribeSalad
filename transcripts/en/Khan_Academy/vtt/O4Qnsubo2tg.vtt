00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:03.120
Find the probability
of rolling doubles

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.134
on two six-sided dice
numbered from 1 to 6.

00:00:07.134 --> 00:00:09.050
So when they're talking
about rolling doubles,

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:10.883
they're just saying,
if I roll the two dice,

00:00:10.883 --> 00:00:12.840
I get the same number
on the top of both.

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.240
So, for example, a 1
and a 1, that's doubles.

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.540
A 2 and a 2, that is doubles.

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:22.400
A 3 and a 3, a 4 and a 4,
a 5 and a 5, a 6 and a 6,

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.280
all of those are
instances of doubles.

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:29.030
So the event in question
is rolling doubles

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:33.250
on two six-sided dice
numbered from 1 to 6.

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:35.585
So let's think about all
of the possible outcomes.

00:00:35.585 --> 00:00:37.210
Or another way to
think about it, let's

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:39.950
think about the
sample space here.

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:42.350
So what can we roll
on the first die.

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.740
So let me write this
as die number 1.

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:48.132
What are the possible rolls?

00:00:48.132 --> 00:00:49.590
Well, they're
numbered from 1 to 6.

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:56.650
It's a six-sided die, so I can
get a 1, a 2, a 3, a 4, a 5,

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:58.010
or a 6.

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:02.780
Now let's think about the
second die, so die number 2.

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:04.129
Well, exact same thing.

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:11.810
I could get a 1, a 2,
a 3, a 4, a 5, or a 6.

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:14.880
Now, given these possible
outcomes for each of the die,

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.660
we can now think of the
outcomes for both die.

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:21.400
So, for example, in this--
let me draw a grid here just

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:22.740
to make it a little bit neater.

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:28.410
So let me draw a line there and
then a line right over there.

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:30.130
Let me draw actually
several of these,

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:33.840
just so that we could really
do this a little bit clearer.

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.070
So let me draw a full grid.

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.040
All right.

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:44.460
And then let me draw the
vertical lines, only a few

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.170
more left.

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:49.020
There we go.

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.350
Now, all of this top row,
these are the outcomes

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.590
where I roll a 1
on the first die.

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:57.080
So I roll a 1 on the first die.

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:00.084
These are all of those outcomes.

00:02:00.084 --> 00:02:02.000
And this would be I run
a 1 on the second die,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:02.950
but I'll fill that in later.

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:04.866
These are all of the
outcomes where I roll a 2

00:02:04.866 --> 00:02:07.710
on the first die.

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.020
This is where I roll
a 3 on the first die.

00:02:13.396 --> 00:02:17.680
4-- I think you get the
idea-- on the first die.

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:22.220
And then a 5 on
the first to die.

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.900
And then finally, this last
row is all the outcomes

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.100
where I roll a 6
on the first die.

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.060
Now, we can go
through the columns,

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.590
and this first column is where
we roll a 1 on the second die.

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:42.440
This is where we roll
a 2 on the second die.

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.900
So let's draw that out, write
it out, and fill in the chart.

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.900
Here's where we roll
a 3 on the second die.

00:02:52.219 --> 00:02:54.510
This is a comma that I'm
doing between the two numbers.

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:55.593
Here is where we have a 4.

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:04.530
And then here is where
we roll a 5 on the second

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:06.390
die, just filling this in.

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.360
This last column is where we
roll a 6 on the second die.

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:26.594
Now, every one of these
represents a possible outcome.

00:03:26.594 --> 00:03:29.010
This outcome is where we roll
a 1 on the first die and a 1

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:29.800
on the second die.

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.970
This outcome is where we
roll a 3 on the first die,

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:33.510
a 2 on the second die.

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:35.750
This outcome is where we
roll a 4 on the first die

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:37.480
and a 5 on the second die.

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:41.430
And you can see here, there are
36 possible outcomes, 6 times

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:43.500
6 possible outcomes.

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:47.880
Now, with this out of the way,
how many of these outcomes

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:55.470
satisfy our criteria of rolling
doubles on two six-sided dice?

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:58.650
How many of these outcomes
are essentially described

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:01.830
by our event?

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:03.250
Well, we see them right here.

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:07.230
Doubles, well, that's rolling
a 1 and 1, that's a 2 and a 2,

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:12.960
a 3 and a 3, a 4 and a 4, a
5 and a 5, and a 6 and a 6.

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:19.610
So we have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
events satisfy this event,

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:23.170
or are the outcomes that are
consistent with this event.

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:25.570
Now given that, let's
answer our question.

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:28.900
What is the probability
of rolling doubles

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:33.690
on two six-sided die
numbered from 1 to 6?

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:35.290
Well, the probability
is going to be

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:40.690
equal to the number of outcomes
that satisfy our criteria,

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:42.900
or the number of outcomes
for this event, which

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:46.680
are 6-- we just figured
that out-- over the total--

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:51.300
I want to do that pink
color-- number of outcomes,

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:54.350
over the size of
our sample space.

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:57.840
So this right over here,
we have 36 total outcomes.

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:01.660
So we have 36 outcomes,
and if you simplify this,

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:06.440
6/36 is the same thing as 1/6.

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:08.900
So the probability
of rolling doubles

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:13.734
on two six-sided dice
numbered from 1 to 6 is 1/6.
