00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Well, I'm going to bring you back to the sixteenth century first.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.940
The Italians, especially, were interested in cubic polynomials

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:14.160
x cubed plus, oh, five x plus seven, something of that sort

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:18.960
Now I'll draw you the graph of any of these cubic polynomials

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.760
That is to say I'll draw it qualitatively. 
Unless you're particularly perverse

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:28.720
in your choice of cubic polynomial it's
gonna look sort of like that

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:30.720
Brady: this kind of distinctive wiggle

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.390
Barry Mazur: there's a wiggle there. There's a ... it
looks like it's getting to a maximum

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:43.700
and then it changes its mind, then goes to a dip there, and then it thinks 'oh gosh this is a valley' and then

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.800
especially if the coefficient of the X
cube is positive it'll go thphsssss

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.120
off to plus infinity

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:56.580
otherwise it will be reversed 
I'll draw you a few of them

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:03.460
now you might say why did I call this a few of them
rather than just one

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:09.680
the reason is I haven't told you where
the x-axis is and I can change my

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.260
cubic polynomial by adding a constant

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:18.920
so raising its graph by adding a constant
or lowering its graph by subtracting a constant

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.580
so maybe the x-axis of this one is there

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.300
the x-axis of this one is there

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:33.740
and the x-axis of this one is there
now once I have told you when the x-axis is

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.920
I can tell you when this polynomial
is zero

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:43.430
at least graphically because the 0s of this
cubic polynomial will just be

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:47.250
where its graph intersects the x-axis

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.840
so this one has only a single 0 there

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:56.000
this one has only a single 0 here

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.680
and this one has 3 of em

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:01.710
these would be the solutions to the
equation a

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.430
for example this one, we will have
to figure out which of these three it is

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:07.530
but doesn't matter

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.860
we're looking for solutions to equations
of this sort

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:16.400
so as I say unless you're really
perverse you either have one or three solutions

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:23.160
and it's the 16th century that people began to get formulas and equations

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.680
for the solutions of cubic polynomials

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.460
that if they for the solutions ... when a
cubic polynomial,

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:33.540
of a problem, when a cubic polynomial is 0

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.020
now, something very funny happened

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:43.700
you think, this guy has three solutions so it must be easier to find them because they are 3 of em

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:48.160
rather than these two which have only one but it's 
quite the reverse

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:58.620
be equations that lead to you to a solution for either of these two, are, well

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:09.350
they're a bit of algebra, but a bit of algebra that's perfectly happily in the, sort of, mental theatre

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:16.750
of the 16th century people. 
This one was a weirdy, it was weird.

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:27.340
and in order to solve this, these are real numbers so all you have to do is work in real numbers

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:31.560
this one too, you work in real numbers and you get be
solution

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:33.720
for this one something very funny happened

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:39.760
I need another sheet of paper
Brady: you can have as many as you ...

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:48.720
Barry Mazur: well this is the toughie and now for this one of course the equation for this is real numbers

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:53.880
the solutions, there are three of them, are real

00:03:53.890 --> 00:04:03.510
and in order to pass from the cubic equation to the solution you have to do various things

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:13.520
and what seemed a little perturbing, in fact very perturbing, to the 16th century people was this passage

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:17.199
you'd have to pass through a region

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:24.719
which seem to be (how do I wanna
put it) out of the familiar mental theatre

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:32.759
of the mathematicians of the time. Let us say imaginary numbers or complex numbers I'll say imaginary.

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:44.640
Mathematicians were perturbed but not that perturbed. And the first recorded instance

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:56.560
of clear perturbation that I know is around 1545, Cardano, who had to use a certain imaginary number

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:03.560
in fact he had to use the numbers five plus the square root of minus 15

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:09.460
and five minus the square root of minus 15

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:23.820
in order to solve his equation or to deal with this issue that he writes: "dismissing mental tortures"

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:28.780
and multiplying (5 plus the square root of minus 15)

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:33.340
times (5 minus the square root of -15)

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:42.020
you get, and he tells you how to do it, well the 5 times 5 is 25

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:49.680
the square root of minus 15 times the five cancels the minus square root of minus 15 times the 5

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:56.860
The 4th term in these crossed terms that you have to consider is the square root of minus fifteen times

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:59.940
minus the square root of minus 15

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:05.380
which if you work it out is 15 and so you get 25 plus fifteen

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:11.510
equals 40 and he writes "multiplying
five plus the square root of minus 15 by five

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:14.160
minus the square root of minus 15 we obtain

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:17.320
25 minus minus

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:21.870
15 and therefore the product is 40 and
thus far does

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:25.860
arithmetical subtlety go of which

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:29.300
this the extreme

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:32.770
is as I have said, so subtle

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:36.450
that it is useless"

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:39.460
he's saying that he hasn't yet

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:43.530
gotten into his mathematical repertoire

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:47.970
this strange creature the square root of minus 15

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:52.120
or complex numbers in general and yet

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:56.600
certainly has an intense understanding

00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:59.770
that we had better

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:03.880
begin to deal with it despite the fact
that it may be subtle

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:06.760
and useless

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:10.930
it's the first instance where someone
complains bitterly

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:16.400
and yet uses such a number 
Brady: does that still happen now do you think or

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:22.640
Barry Mazur: do we complain bitterly about things that we're on the verge of understanding but not quite?

00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:27.380
You know, I'm about to say

00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:31.510
yes it doesn't matter what blob

00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:34.640
they are as long as they're similar

00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:38.060
councillor says 'yes' 'what do you call that?' says the king

00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:41.600
'oh I call that the blah Pythagorean theorem'
