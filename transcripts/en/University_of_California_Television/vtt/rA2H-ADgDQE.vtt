00:00:05.428 --> 00:00:08.511
(upbeat piano music)

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:12.439
- [Narrator] We are the paradoxical ape.

00:00:12.439 --> 00:00:13.725
Bipedal.

00:00:13.725 --> 00:00:14.959
Naked.

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:16.126
Large-brained.

00:00:17.638 --> 00:00:21.740
Long the master of fire,
tools and language.

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:25.157
But still trying to understand ourselves.

00:00:25.992 --> 00:00:29.274
Aware that death is inevitable.

00:00:29.274 --> 00:00:31.357
Yet filled with optimism.

00:00:32.636 --> 00:00:34.952
We grow up slowly.

00:00:34.952 --> 00:00:37.604
We hand down knowledge.

00:00:37.604 --> 00:00:39.687
We empathize and deceive.

00:00:41.062 --> 00:00:42.853
We shape the future from our shared

00:00:42.853 --> 00:00:45.020
understanding of the past.

00:00:46.473 --> 00:00:48.569
CARTA brings together experts

00:00:48.569 --> 00:00:51.779
from diverse disciplines
to exchange insights

00:00:51.779 --> 00:00:54.612
on who we are and how we got here.

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:58.067
An exploration made possible

00:00:58.067 --> 00:01:01.150
by the generosity of humans like you.

00:01:15.148 --> 00:01:17.815
(uptempo music)

00:01:20.862 --> 00:01:23.445
(upbeat music)

00:01:39.745 --> 00:01:42.568
- Well you all remembered
to come here today

00:01:42.568 --> 00:01:45.425
and you all remembered how to get here.

00:01:45.425 --> 00:01:48.538
And you all have plans
for what you're gonna do

00:01:48.538 --> 00:01:51.602
after this meeting is over later today

00:01:51.602 --> 00:01:53.223
because that's what it's all about.

00:01:53.223 --> 00:01:56.059
Our world is a world of memories

00:01:56.059 --> 00:01:57.937
and we are our memories.

00:01:57.937 --> 00:02:00.542
And we think about memory
often about the past,

00:02:00.542 --> 00:02:02.751
but memory is really about the future

00:02:02.751 --> 00:02:06.228
because it enables us to use
information that you gain

00:02:06.228 --> 00:02:07.630
in order to get along in life,

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:09.758
and that's what it's all about.

00:02:09.758 --> 00:02:11.613
Well, I'm gonna talk about some people

00:02:11.613 --> 00:02:15.141
for whom the future is
not terribly important

00:02:15.141 --> 00:02:20.129
but the past is awfully
important, unusual people indeed.

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:24.183
So here's the question of
the very famous psychologist,

00:02:24.183 --> 00:02:27.909
maybe the founder of modern
psychology, William James.

00:02:27.909 --> 00:02:29.311
He said, "Of some experiences

00:02:29.311 --> 00:02:31.776
"no memory survives the
instance of their passage.

00:02:31.776 --> 00:02:35.941
"Of others, it is confined to
a few moments, hours or days.

00:02:35.941 --> 00:02:39.209
"Others may be recalled
as long as life endures.

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:41.530
"Can we explain these differences?"

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:45.182
Why is it that you can remember right now

00:02:45.182 --> 00:02:47.902
exactly what I said,
even with the intonation,

00:02:47.902 --> 00:02:49.934
you could mimic me,

00:02:49.934 --> 00:02:52.727
and tomorrow, you're gonna
remember that there was a meeting

00:02:52.727 --> 00:02:54.301
that you came to and you're gonna

00:02:54.301 --> 00:02:55.529
(audience laughs)

00:02:55.529 --> 00:02:56.754
remember a few elements.

00:02:56.754 --> 00:02:58.254
Well, I'm gonna...

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:02.864
It's not like that for all people.

00:03:02.864 --> 00:03:05.369
There was a man named Daniel McCartney

00:03:05.369 --> 00:03:08.413
about whom an article was published

00:03:08.413 --> 00:03:11.343
in the Journal of Speculative Philosophy.

00:03:11.343 --> 00:03:13.128
So, you probably subscribe to the journal,

00:03:13.128 --> 00:03:15.450
Journal of Speculative Philosophy,

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:17.661
which I had never heard of until

00:03:17.661 --> 00:03:20.790
somebody drew my attention to this.

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:22.623
Who was tested in 1870

00:03:25.005 --> 00:03:29.170
by a man who discovered
that this individual claimed

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:30.287
that he had a very strong

00:03:30.287 --> 00:03:32.719
memory of his personal experiences.

00:03:32.719 --> 00:03:35.802
So, when he was 54 years old in 1870,

00:03:36.857 --> 00:03:39.998
he was asked a lot of
questions about his life

00:03:39.998 --> 00:03:41.576
going back many, many years back

00:03:41.576 --> 00:03:44.539
actually to the age of four years old.

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:48.855
And he responded in every
case to the questions

00:03:48.855 --> 00:03:51.591
in two or three seconds.

00:03:51.591 --> 00:03:55.653
The test was repeated several days later

00:03:55.653 --> 00:03:58.670
and he responded with the same answers

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:00.498
but not using the same words.

00:04:00.498 --> 00:04:03.071
That is, he knew what he could remember

00:04:03.071 --> 00:04:05.635
but he used different words to say it.

00:04:05.635 --> 00:04:09.288
What happened on October 8th, 1828,

00:04:09.288 --> 00:04:11.922
Wednesday, it was cloudy
and drizzling and rain.

00:04:11.922 --> 00:04:15.469
I carried dinner to my father
where he was getting out coal.

00:04:15.469 --> 00:04:17.302
That was 42 years ago.

00:04:18.306 --> 00:04:21.973
Let me run down, let's
take April 4th, 1841,

00:04:23.004 --> 00:04:24.197
he answered in three seconds.

00:04:24.197 --> 00:04:26.469
It was a Sunday, it was rainy and muddy.

00:04:26.469 --> 00:04:29.479
General Harrison died that day.

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:32.974
February 2nd, 1856, two-second response.

00:04:32.974 --> 00:04:34.563
Saturday it was most awful cold,

00:04:34.563 --> 00:04:37.163
it was the coldest day
I ever see in my life.

00:04:37.163 --> 00:04:38.981
Records for Iowa, February 4th

00:04:38.981 --> 00:04:42.340
indicated the coldest day in 1856.

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:47.042
Now that's the bottom, that's
my interrogation because

00:04:47.042 --> 00:04:49.568
all of these are claims that people make

00:04:49.568 --> 00:04:51.221
and you could make them up, you know?

00:04:51.221 --> 00:04:54.138
What did you do in June 12th, 1993?

00:04:55.745 --> 00:04:57.592
And you could, oh, I
went shopping that day.

00:04:57.592 --> 00:05:00.240
I had a fight with my
boyfriend or whatever.

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:01.073
(audience laughs)

00:05:01.073 --> 00:05:02.782
And I wouldn't know
whether that's true or not.

00:05:02.782 --> 00:05:06.479
So, to my limited ability that I had,

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:08.603
I looked up the records
for things that he said

00:05:08.603 --> 00:05:11.139
when he said it snowed or it rained.

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:13.626
On the day that he said
it was a heavy snow

00:05:13.626 --> 00:05:17.097
that was a heaviest day of
snowing in Iowa that year.

00:05:17.097 --> 00:05:20.266
On the day that it rained,
it was within two days

00:05:20.266 --> 00:05:21.759
of the date that he gave.

00:05:21.759 --> 00:05:26.055
So to the extent that we
can validate these claims,

00:05:26.055 --> 00:05:28.738
they appear to be accurate,

00:05:28.738 --> 00:05:30.759
he appears to have a phenomenal memory

00:05:30.759 --> 00:05:32.177
of his personal experiences,

00:05:32.177 --> 00:05:34.682
but not a lot is known about him.

00:05:34.682 --> 00:05:37.122
I'm just reporting what was reported

00:05:37.122 --> 00:05:39.820
in that rather obscure journal.

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:41.721
Now, I didn't know anything about him,

00:05:41.721 --> 00:05:42.975
I had never read that article.

00:05:42.975 --> 00:05:45.102
As a matter of fact, that
article was sent to me

00:05:45.102 --> 00:05:49.274
by a wag who after we started
publishing our work on

00:05:49.274 --> 00:05:50.901
Highly Superior Autobiographical Memory,

00:05:50.901 --> 00:05:52.631
essentially he said, "Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:05:52.631 --> 00:05:54.426
"You didn't know about this, you know?"

00:05:54.426 --> 00:05:57.069
And he sent me the
article from this journal

00:05:57.069 --> 00:05:59.141
that I do not subscribe to, yeah.

00:05:59.141 --> 00:06:00.024
(audience laughing)

00:06:00.024 --> 00:06:02.774
And I haven't found it on PubMed.

00:06:04.888 --> 00:06:09.741
In 2000, a young woman, 32
years old named Jill Price

00:06:09.741 --> 00:06:11.392
sent me an email

00:06:11.392 --> 00:06:14.155
and it said she had a memory problem

00:06:14.155 --> 00:06:15.709
and would like to meet me.

00:06:15.709 --> 00:06:17.425
Well, I wrote back to her and said

00:06:17.425 --> 00:06:19.713
this is a research institute, not a clinic

00:06:19.713 --> 00:06:20.933
but I can direct you to it.

00:06:20.933 --> 00:06:22.386
What would you think when somebody said

00:06:22.386 --> 00:06:24.913
I have a memory problem, right?

00:06:24.913 --> 00:06:26.697
Well she said, "Oh no, no, that's it.

00:06:26.697 --> 00:06:30.423
"My memory problem is
that I don't forget."

00:06:30.423 --> 00:06:33.006
So, I decided to meet with her.

00:06:34.193 --> 00:06:36.880
I really thought that she probably didn't.

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:39.191
I really did think this
was a very strange behavior

00:06:39.191 --> 00:06:41.691
but I agreed to meet with her.

00:06:43.519 --> 00:06:46.554
When she came since we have never seen any

00:06:46.554 --> 00:06:49.126
by like that are tested
I didn't know what to do.

00:06:49.126 --> 00:06:52.548
I had been given for
Christmas, this is 2000

00:06:52.548 --> 00:06:55.259
and I had been given a coffee table book

00:06:55.259 --> 00:06:57.092
which is about this thick

00:06:57.092 --> 00:07:01.259
which is newspaper reports for
everyday in the last century.

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:06.190
You may have seen them, they
were around in that time.

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:08.065
And so, all I did was open that book

00:07:08.065 --> 00:07:09.149
and asked her questions.

00:07:09.149 --> 00:07:13.149
I turned to a page which
was after the age of 13

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:17.545
because she said that's when
she began to have this ability.

00:07:17.545 --> 00:07:19.885
And I questioned her

00:07:19.885 --> 00:07:22.212
and these were the kinds
of thing that I asked.

00:07:22.212 --> 00:07:23.874
I asked about an event.

00:07:23.874 --> 00:07:28.356
I said when was there a
major San Diego plane crash.

00:07:28.356 --> 00:07:30.097
How many of you remember the plane crash

00:07:30.097 --> 00:07:32.097
in September 25th, 1978?

00:07:33.311 --> 00:07:34.972
How many of you would
have remembered the date

00:07:34.972 --> 00:07:36.505
if I hadn't said that?

00:07:36.505 --> 00:07:37.944
All right.

00:07:37.944 --> 00:07:40.002
When did the Persian Gulf War start?

00:07:40.002 --> 00:07:41.938
Wednesday, January 16, 1991.

00:07:41.938 --> 00:07:43.840
And so on down the line.

00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:46.568
The one at the bottom I
wanna draw your attention to.

00:07:46.568 --> 00:07:50.795
I asked her when was the Iranian
invasion of the US Embassy

00:07:50.795 --> 00:07:53.378
and she said November 4th, 1979

00:07:55.358 --> 00:07:57.893
and I was looking at the
article right in front of me,

00:07:57.893 --> 00:07:59.851
and I said, "Well, you
have it pretty close.

00:07:59.851 --> 00:08:01.900
"You're several days off."

00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:02.972
And she said, "No, no, no.

00:08:02.972 --> 00:08:04.291
"This is the date."

00:08:04.291 --> 00:08:05.925
And I said, "Well, it's written
here right in the book."

00:08:05.925 --> 00:08:07.618
And she said, "Well, the book is wrong."

00:08:07.618 --> 00:08:09.035
(audience laughs)

00:08:09.035 --> 00:08:11.142
Well, it turns out that I was looking

00:08:11.142 --> 00:08:13.606
at the date of the article it was written

00:08:13.606 --> 00:08:17.953
and down in the body of
the article was the true,

00:08:17.953 --> 00:08:21.831
the valid time which
is November 4th, 1979.

00:08:21.831 --> 00:08:24.310
But it was her assurance
that was important.

00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:26.945
"The book was wrong," she said.

00:08:26.945 --> 00:08:30.695
Now, we also or I also
asked her about dates.

00:08:31.928 --> 00:08:34.656
I gave her a date and she had to tell me

00:08:34.656 --> 00:08:36.176
what happened on that date.

00:08:36.176 --> 00:08:38.593
August 16th, 1977 Elvis died.

00:08:42.284 --> 00:08:44.875
Let's go down November 4th, 1979

00:08:44.875 --> 00:08:49.269
and that's right, the Iranian
invasion of US Embassy.

00:08:49.269 --> 00:08:52.269
October 5th, 1983 bombing in Beirut.

00:08:54.335 --> 00:08:57.406
Northridge earthquake
and Lockerby plane crash.

00:08:57.406 --> 00:08:59.718
And so, these are all accurate.

00:08:59.718 --> 00:09:03.067
These are her responses
and I'm looking at the book

00:09:03.067 --> 00:09:05.611
so I knew the answers but I knew them

00:09:05.611 --> 00:09:08.193
because I was looking at them.

00:09:08.193 --> 00:09:12.360
Now, we can't take these
statements as being a valid.

00:09:16.156 --> 00:09:18.571
As a matter of fact, she
says that she remembers

00:09:18.571 --> 00:09:21.767
being in a crib when she was an infant.

00:09:21.767 --> 00:09:23.876
Well, I'm not gonna accept that.

00:09:23.876 --> 00:09:25.542
We have no way of validating

00:09:25.542 --> 00:09:29.412
and besides that, plenty
of people see videos

00:09:29.412 --> 00:09:32.173
of themselves in cribs or
pictures of themselves.

00:09:32.173 --> 00:09:34.602
And so, that's not gonna do the job,

00:09:34.602 --> 00:09:36.519
we have to validate it.

00:09:38.189 --> 00:09:41.768
Fortunately, in her case she kept a diary

00:09:41.768 --> 00:09:43.401
for many years of her life

00:09:43.401 --> 00:09:45.208
and whenever she made a claim

00:09:45.208 --> 00:09:48.082
we were able to untie
a little pink ribbon,

00:09:48.082 --> 00:09:50.736
it was tied around this
little book that she had

00:09:50.736 --> 00:09:52.611
and lots of books, so stacked like that,

00:09:52.611 --> 00:09:56.778
opened it up and see if what
she said about it was accurate.

00:09:58.361 --> 00:10:01.361
At one time, we asked her to give us

00:10:02.744 --> 00:10:05.494
the dates of the last 20 Easters.

00:10:06.394 --> 00:10:08.992
How many of you remember
the date of the last Easter?

00:10:08.992 --> 00:10:12.055
(audience laughs)

00:10:12.055 --> 00:10:16.937
Now, she told us the date
of the last 20 Easters.

00:10:16.937 --> 00:10:19.452
She also told us without asking

00:10:19.452 --> 00:10:22.353
what she did on each of those dates

00:10:22.353 --> 00:10:23.615
and we could check that out

00:10:23.615 --> 00:10:25.815
because we're able to
peek into her diaries

00:10:25.815 --> 00:10:28.982
and validate some of that information.

00:10:30.019 --> 00:10:32.807
Now, I'm gonna show you
some other subjects,

00:10:32.807 --> 00:10:37.257
let me, I have to say that
we got a little publicity

00:10:37.257 --> 00:10:39.412
inadvertently sort of.

00:10:39.412 --> 00:10:42.294
We went on NPR, disguised her name,

00:10:42.294 --> 00:10:43.997
but talked about this a little bit

00:10:43.997 --> 00:10:46.303
and then a little bit
on newspaper publicity.

00:10:46.303 --> 00:10:48.806
We began to get subjects

00:10:48.806 --> 00:10:51.723
and by the time 2010 rolled around,

00:10:55.301 --> 00:10:57.385
we had five subjects.

00:10:57.385 --> 00:11:00.385
Now, they were filmed on 60 Minutes

00:11:02.926 --> 00:11:06.882
on December 19th, 2010, that was a Sunday.

00:11:06.882 --> 00:11:09.882
(audience laughing)

00:11:13.833 --> 00:11:16.641
It's helpful but 60 Minutes
is always on a Sunday,

00:11:16.641 --> 00:11:18.474
that's a little clue.

00:11:18.474 --> 00:11:20.474
I did, well, I'll go on.

00:11:21.368 --> 00:11:23.216
I don't wanna show off anymore.

00:11:23.216 --> 00:11:24.539
(audience laughs)

00:11:24.539 --> 00:11:26.956
I'm gonna show you clips from

00:11:29.603 --> 00:11:32.289
TV programs in which we had this.

00:11:32.289 --> 00:11:35.005
The first one is Louise Owen

00:11:35.005 --> 00:11:37.883
who is a professional
violinist in New York,

00:11:37.883 --> 00:11:40.396
a very high level violinist.

00:11:40.396 --> 00:11:43.146
Appears frequently both in groups

00:11:44.127 --> 00:11:48.756
and also well solos and is
really a very charming person.

00:11:48.756 --> 00:11:50.751
I'll show you her first.

00:11:50.751 --> 00:11:52.646
- [Narrator] McGaugh
says this type of memory

00:11:52.646 --> 00:11:54.934
is completely new to science

00:11:54.934 --> 00:11:58.359
so he and his colleagues have
had to device their own test

00:11:58.359 --> 00:12:00.496
like this one on public events.

00:12:00.496 --> 00:12:03.020
- October 19th, 1987.

00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:04.815
- It was a Monday, that
was the day of the big

00:12:04.815 --> 00:12:07.396
stock market crash and the
cellist Jacqueline du Pre

00:12:07.396 --> 00:12:08.426
died that day.

00:12:08.426 --> 00:12:10.686
- The Berlin Wall falls on what day?

00:12:10.686 --> 00:12:14.663
- November 9th, 1989 which was a Thursday.

00:12:14.663 --> 00:12:17.340
- Christopher Reeve's
accident occurred on what day?

00:12:17.340 --> 00:12:21.701
- [Louise] It was
Saturday, May 27th, 1995.

00:12:21.701 --> 00:12:24.948
- And when were the Oscars held in 1999?

00:12:24.948 --> 00:12:27.385
- In 1999, Sunday, March 21st.

00:12:27.385 --> 00:12:28.635
- Yes, perfect.

00:12:29.702 --> 00:12:31.521
- Note that she didn't
say give me a moment,

00:12:31.521 --> 00:12:32.627
I'll think about it.

00:12:32.627 --> 00:12:35.822
(audience laughing)

00:12:35.822 --> 00:12:38.592
She describes it as a Google Search

00:12:38.592 --> 00:12:41.148
and when she talks about
it she uses expressions.

00:12:41.148 --> 00:12:45.456
She says it's just there,
it just comes up like that

00:12:45.456 --> 00:12:47.429
and you can see the ease
with which she did it,

00:12:47.429 --> 00:12:49.002
the smile on her face

00:12:49.002 --> 00:12:53.223
and the speed of responding
within a second or two,

00:12:53.223 --> 00:12:54.640
it's right there.

00:12:55.696 --> 00:12:58.696
Let's move back in time now to 1990.

00:12:59.746 --> 00:13:03.284
It rained on several days
in January and February.

00:13:03.284 --> 00:13:06.995
Can you name the dates on which it rained?

00:13:06.995 --> 00:13:08.382
(laughs)

00:13:08.382 --> 00:13:10.380
- [Narrator] Believe it or not she could.

00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:13.675
- Let's see, it was
slightly rainy and cloudy

00:13:13.675 --> 00:13:15.508
on January 14th, 15th.

00:13:17.683 --> 00:13:22.035
It was very hot the weekend
of the 27th to 28th, no rain.

00:13:22.035 --> 00:13:24.624
- [Narrator] We checked the
official weather records.

00:13:24.624 --> 00:13:28.673
- It rained very hard
on Sunday, February 4th.

00:13:28.673 --> 00:13:31.417
- [Narrator] And she was right.

00:13:31.417 --> 00:13:34.159
- All right, that was 20 years ago

00:13:34.159 --> 00:13:35.667
from the time that I asked her.

00:13:35.667 --> 00:13:38.473
I was asking her when did
it rain in New York City

00:13:38.473 --> 00:13:40.402
20 years ago in January, February

00:13:40.402 --> 00:13:42.486
and she nailed everyday.

00:13:42.486 --> 00:13:44.456
Now, this is important because

00:13:44.456 --> 00:13:47.026
for many of the other
examples that I've shown,

00:13:47.026 --> 00:13:48.454
people could memorize.

00:13:48.454 --> 00:13:50.121
That is if you set your mind to it

00:13:50.121 --> 00:13:51.408
you could memorize thing

00:13:51.408 --> 00:13:54.253
and you spend all of your
time memorizing experiences

00:13:54.253 --> 00:13:57.610
like learning a list of
words or whatever I suppose.

00:13:57.610 --> 00:14:00.846
I chose this example
because it's highly unlikely

00:14:00.846 --> 00:14:02.903
unless you wanna challenge me on this,

00:14:02.903 --> 00:14:04.863
that she sat around for 20 years saying

00:14:04.863 --> 00:14:07.579
I must remember the
days in which it rained

00:14:07.579 --> 00:14:10.246
in New York on those two months.

00:14:12.347 --> 00:14:14.786
Now we have also, by luck,

00:14:14.786 --> 00:14:17.692
found several children
who have this ability

00:14:17.692 --> 00:14:21.006
and this is important also because of the

00:14:21.006 --> 00:14:23.432
possible interpretation that these people

00:14:23.432 --> 00:14:25.842
have the ability because
they spend a lot of time

00:14:25.842 --> 00:14:28.511
rehearsing, rehearsing, rehearsing.

00:14:28.511 --> 00:14:30.565
Children don't have much time to do that

00:14:30.565 --> 00:14:34.340
so I'm gonna show you a couple
of fairly young children

00:14:34.340 --> 00:14:38.507
who have ability which is
just as good as our adults.

00:14:40.147 --> 00:14:42.296
- Hausler, age 10.

00:14:42.296 --> 00:14:45.858
What day of the week was Halloween 2011?

00:14:45.858 --> 00:14:47.154
- Monday.

00:14:47.154 --> 00:14:49.066
That one I didn't even
have to think about.

00:14:49.066 --> 00:14:51.314
- New Year's day 2010.

00:14:51.314 --> 00:14:52.645
- A Friday.

00:14:52.645 --> 00:14:53.478
- [Woman] Friday.

00:14:53.478 --> 00:14:54.988
- I remember that because I was up

00:14:54.988 --> 00:14:57.827
all night at the Blues game.

00:14:57.827 --> 00:14:59.724
- That's when Jake was 6.

00:14:59.724 --> 00:15:02.340
He lives in Saint Louis, loves sports

00:15:02.340 --> 00:15:05.471
and he is in most respects,
a typical 10-year old.

00:15:05.471 --> 00:15:07.761
What happened related to school

00:15:07.761 --> 00:15:09.594
on January 30th, 2013?

00:15:11.057 --> 00:15:13.578
- That day I'm pretty sure.

00:15:13.578 --> 00:15:16.734
Oh wait, that's a trick question.

00:15:16.734 --> 00:15:18.300
No school that day.

00:15:18.300 --> 00:15:20.854
(audience laughing)

00:15:20.854 --> 00:15:23.295
There's a lightning storm that one night.

00:15:23.295 --> 00:15:27.128
I'm like yeah, we didn't
have school that day.

00:15:30.375 --> 00:15:34.974
- [James] 7th 2012, you know
what day of the week that was?

00:15:34.974 --> 00:15:36.508
- That was a Sunday.

00:15:36.508 --> 00:15:37.587
- [James] You're right.

00:15:37.587 --> 00:15:40.101
- [Narrator] There is exactly
one child in the world

00:15:40.101 --> 00:15:42.984
other than Jake who's
been identified so far

00:15:42.984 --> 00:15:44.247
with this ability,

00:15:44.247 --> 00:15:47.072
11-year old Tyler Hickenbottom.

00:15:47.072 --> 00:15:49.714
And in a fortuitous coincidence,

00:15:49.714 --> 00:15:53.155
Tyler happens to be an identical twin.

00:15:53.155 --> 00:15:55.990
He and his brother, Chad,
share the same genes.

00:15:55.990 --> 00:15:59.787
- Yeah, I think I might
have worn an orange shirt.

00:15:59.787 --> 00:16:02.472
- [Narrator] But surprisingly
not the same memory.

00:16:02.472 --> 00:16:05.155
- No, it was obviously on 2012 when.

00:16:05.155 --> 00:16:08.155
(audience laughing)

00:16:14.152 --> 00:16:15.574
- Life can be tough.

00:16:15.574 --> 00:16:19.033
(audience laughing)

00:16:19.033 --> 00:16:21.347
This is very interesting.

00:16:21.347 --> 00:16:23.436
We are doing genetic studies now,

00:16:23.436 --> 00:16:25.679
we're collaborating in genetic studies

00:16:25.679 --> 00:16:28.439
and the first thing we wanna find out is

00:16:28.439 --> 00:16:30.495
are they really identical twins.

00:16:30.495 --> 00:16:32.126
Their parents claim that they are

00:16:32.126 --> 00:16:34.840
and we're going to recheck that.

00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:37.459
Once again, the reason for
the interest in children

00:16:37.459 --> 00:16:39.612
is because we wanna find out

00:16:39.612 --> 00:16:44.031
the age at which this is
first recognized by children.

00:16:44.031 --> 00:16:46.666
We have younger children
now who are 10 years old

00:16:46.666 --> 00:16:50.635
who have the ability going
back to the age of five,

00:16:50.635 --> 00:16:52.843
and a little bit earlier than that.

00:16:52.843 --> 00:16:57.454
This is not an ability which
is acquired later in life,

00:16:57.454 --> 00:16:58.972
it appears fairly early on.

00:16:58.972 --> 00:17:01.250
How early, we don't yet know.

00:17:01.250 --> 00:17:05.417
Now here is a distribution
of the ability of people

00:17:06.255 --> 00:17:08.295
who have what we call HSAM

00:17:08.295 --> 00:17:11.191
or highly superior autobiographical memory

00:17:11.191 --> 00:17:15.125
and on the right in the white and blue

00:17:15.125 --> 00:17:18.088
you see the distribution
of the percent correct

00:17:18.088 --> 00:17:20.371
on a 30 question quiz of the kind

00:17:20.371 --> 00:17:22.648
that I've already talked about

00:17:22.648 --> 00:17:26.815
ranging from let's say 35%
correct up to 75% correct.

00:17:28.741 --> 00:17:30.989
On the left in orange you see controls,

00:17:30.989 --> 00:17:33.821
age and sex match controls

00:17:33.821 --> 00:17:36.140
and you can see that this is not,

00:17:36.140 --> 00:17:38.314
this ability is not the end of,

00:17:38.314 --> 00:17:40.815
extreme end of a normal distribution,

00:17:40.815 --> 00:17:43.591
it is a different distribution.

00:17:43.591 --> 00:17:45.442
Also you can see some white

00:17:45.442 --> 00:17:47.032
on the left mixed with the orange.

00:17:47.032 --> 00:17:50.151
These are people who claim
that they have the ability

00:17:50.151 --> 00:17:52.085
and were just like controls.

00:17:52.085 --> 00:17:53.729
If you look on the far left

00:17:53.729 --> 00:17:54.978
there are four people who claim

00:17:54.978 --> 00:17:58.200
they have the ability and
they are worse than controls.

00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:00.561
(audience laughing)

00:18:00.561 --> 00:18:04.561
We gave the best of those
a 10 Dates Quiz asking

00:18:05.964 --> 00:18:09.661
for 10 dates that we
selected a day of the week,

00:18:09.661 --> 00:18:13.228
a verifiable event that
happened on that day.

00:18:13.228 --> 00:18:16.297
An autobiographical event
which we did not check

00:18:16.297 --> 00:18:18.214
but they claimed it was autobiographical.

00:18:18.214 --> 00:18:21.457
Now what you can see is
in the blue are the people

00:18:21.457 --> 00:18:24.861
that have this ability
and the orange are us

00:18:24.861 --> 00:18:28.835
and you can see that they
get about 14% correct

00:18:28.835 --> 00:18:32.585
on day of the week which is
one out of seven by the way.

00:18:32.585 --> 00:18:35.585
(audience laughing)

00:18:38.364 --> 00:18:42.131
They have no verifiable event and see.

00:18:42.131 --> 00:18:44.152
So you see they are quite different.

00:18:44.152 --> 00:18:46.744
We also gave them
autobiographical memory test

00:18:46.744 --> 00:18:49.147
and here we validated,

00:18:49.147 --> 00:18:51.015
we ask them first day at university,

00:18:51.015 --> 00:18:52.711
first day at elementary school,

00:18:52.711 --> 00:18:54.857
so on, down the list that you can see.

00:18:54.857 --> 00:18:58.678
And we thankfully got all of
the data, support all of that.

00:18:58.678 --> 00:19:02.345
Our HSAM subjects gave
145 verified details,

00:19:03.581 --> 00:19:06.157
controls gave a total of 24 details

00:19:06.157 --> 00:19:08.312
which we did not bother to verify.

00:19:08.312 --> 00:19:09.145
(audience laughs)

00:19:09.145 --> 00:19:10.787
All right, here are some characteristics.

00:19:10.787 --> 00:19:12.942
These folks are highly accurate

00:19:12.942 --> 00:19:15.163
in autobiographical remembering.

00:19:15.163 --> 00:19:16.825
They are not at all exceptional

00:19:16.825 --> 00:19:18.616
in learning and laboratory tests.

00:19:18.616 --> 00:19:20.993
We've done a lot of experimental

00:19:20.993 --> 00:19:22.772
psychology types of test with them

00:19:22.772 --> 00:19:26.746
and they're absolutely on average normal.

00:19:26.746 --> 00:19:28.255
One thing that is of interest,

00:19:28.255 --> 00:19:31.694
they also show signs of compulsiveness

00:19:31.694 --> 00:19:35.314
and they show some
differences in brain regions,

00:19:35.314 --> 00:19:37.258
so I'll show you quickly here.

00:19:37.258 --> 00:19:39.530
Here's the region of uncinate fasciculus

00:19:39.530 --> 00:19:41.655
which is a fiber pathway that goes

00:19:41.655 --> 00:19:44.187
from the temporal lobe
up to the frontal lobes.

00:19:44.187 --> 00:19:48.187
And this is more obvious
in MRI, structural MRI.

00:19:49.962 --> 00:19:53.026
It's also a region that
is found to be deficient

00:19:53.026 --> 00:19:57.193
in people who have highly
deficient autobiographical memory.

00:19:58.073 --> 00:19:59.761
The parahippocampal gyrus

00:19:59.761 --> 00:20:01.557
which is not too much of a surprise

00:20:01.557 --> 00:20:04.204
because that region has
been implicated in memory

00:20:04.204 --> 00:20:05.750
and also found in people

00:20:05.750 --> 00:20:08.029
who have strong memory of other kinds.

00:20:08.029 --> 00:20:10.324
And the lentiform nucleus which is in the

00:20:10.324 --> 00:20:13.576
region of the, we caught
a nucleus which has

00:20:13.576 --> 00:20:17.321
some studies have shown to be significant,

00:20:17.321 --> 00:20:20.358
significantly observed in people who have

00:20:20.358 --> 00:20:23.208
obsessive compulsive disorder.

00:20:23.208 --> 00:20:25.881
And all of our people score highly

00:20:25.881 --> 00:20:28.302
on obsessive compulsive test

00:20:28.302 --> 00:20:32.739
and they also display
obsessiveness, germ avoidance

00:20:32.739 --> 00:20:33.572
and other things.

00:20:33.572 --> 00:20:35.406
I have the time I could tell you

00:20:35.406 --> 00:20:38.665
some very interesting things
about what they avoid.

00:20:38.665 --> 00:20:41.367
Here's some important questions.

00:20:41.367 --> 00:20:44.327
First, what insights can
we learn about memory?

00:20:44.327 --> 00:20:46.713
Is it strong storage of information

00:20:46.713 --> 00:20:49.447
or is it exceptional retrieval?

00:20:49.447 --> 00:20:51.631
We don't think it's simply
exceptional retrieval

00:20:51.631 --> 00:20:54.045
because it's exceptional retrieval

00:20:54.045 --> 00:20:56.619
of their own autobiographical experiences,

00:20:56.619 --> 00:20:58.266
not of other things.

00:20:58.266 --> 00:21:00.400
We even did an experiment in which we

00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:02.266
gave them some information

00:21:02.266 --> 00:21:05.627
and then they had a discussion
with the experimenter

00:21:05.627 --> 00:21:07.089
and they were tested later on.

00:21:07.089 --> 00:21:08.873
They remembered everything that they said

00:21:08.873 --> 00:21:11.028
and nothing that the experimenter said.

00:21:11.028 --> 00:21:11.861
(audience laughs)

00:21:11.861 --> 00:21:13.944
So, it is all about them.

00:21:14.841 --> 00:21:18.244
(audience laughs)

00:21:18.244 --> 00:21:21.882
Is there involvement of emotional arousal?

00:21:21.882 --> 00:21:23.757
Well, that's what I do for a living.

00:21:23.757 --> 00:21:25.620
That's my main research

00:21:25.620 --> 00:21:27.501
and yet we have plenty of examples

00:21:27.501 --> 00:21:29.699
of them remembering pretty banal things.

00:21:29.699 --> 00:21:32.350
You saw the list that I showed you.

00:21:32.350 --> 00:21:34.511
My favorite example is our first subject.

00:21:34.511 --> 00:21:38.665
I asked her if she knew
who Bing Crosby was

00:21:38.665 --> 00:21:40.289
and she said yes.

00:21:40.289 --> 00:21:41.440
She would have been very young,

00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:43.119
maybe in her teenage years

00:21:43.119 --> 00:21:44.764
I said, "You know what happened to him?"

00:21:44.764 --> 00:21:47.504
And she said, "Oh yes, he died
on a golf course in Spain."

00:21:47.504 --> 00:21:49.762
And she gave me the date and the day.

00:21:49.762 --> 00:21:50.982
And I said, "How did you know that?"

00:21:50.982 --> 00:21:53.978
She said, "Well, my mother was
driving me to a soccer game

00:21:53.978 --> 00:21:56.438
"and the news came on over the radio."

00:21:56.438 --> 00:21:59.686
And she remembers that to this day.

00:21:59.686 --> 00:22:00.964
Is there a genetic basis?

00:22:00.964 --> 00:22:04.155
We're studying that at the
present time, we don't know.

00:22:04.155 --> 00:22:06.201
Neurobiological implications?

00:22:06.201 --> 00:22:07.961
I think this is the most important one

00:22:07.961 --> 00:22:11.130
and this has been touched
on already in the symposium.

00:22:11.130 --> 00:22:14.797
These individuals not
only can give us clues

00:22:16.124 --> 00:22:18.782
to understanding how their brain works

00:22:18.782 --> 00:22:22.949
in order to produce this really
phenomenal memory ability

00:22:24.991 --> 00:22:27.770
but by understanding the
neural underpinnings of this

00:22:27.770 --> 00:22:29.748
we can get a greater understanding

00:22:29.748 --> 00:22:32.070
of how the brain processes memory,

00:22:32.070 --> 00:22:35.653
new insights can come
from this ultimately.

00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:40.492
And then finally, why
is this ability so rare?

00:22:40.492 --> 00:22:42.960
If memory is so important
I started off by saying

00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:45.001
it's our most important ability.

00:22:45.001 --> 00:22:48.128
Why is it that we are
so poor in what we do

00:22:48.128 --> 00:22:51.211
and in a certain way they are better?

00:22:52.217 --> 00:22:55.237
William James said,
"Forgetting is as important

00:22:55.237 --> 00:22:57.074
"a function as recollecting.

00:22:57.074 --> 00:22:59.312
"If we remembered everything we should be

00:22:59.312 --> 00:23:01.506
"on most occasions as ill off

00:23:01.506 --> 00:23:04.416
"as if we remembered nothing."

00:23:04.416 --> 00:23:09.243
These people remember an awful
lot about in a way nothing,

00:23:09.243 --> 00:23:12.618
just trivial events they
remember quite well.

00:23:12.618 --> 00:23:15.395
They are unremarkable in other respects.

00:23:15.395 --> 00:23:17.267
If they were here in the room

00:23:17.267 --> 00:23:19.617
and there may be several people here,

00:23:19.617 --> 00:23:21.377
if you didn't ask memory questions

00:23:21.377 --> 00:23:24.177
you would not be able to identify them.

00:23:24.177 --> 00:23:26.922
They remember for a long period of time

00:23:26.922 --> 00:23:29.539
and we need to find out
and our research will

00:23:29.539 --> 00:23:31.594
continue to do that, thank you.

00:23:31.594 --> 00:23:35.302
(audience clapping)

00:23:35.302 --> 00:23:39.526
- There's a long history
writing about Savant's

00:23:39.526 --> 00:23:43.132
who emerged in childhood
and I'm gonna talk about

00:23:43.132 --> 00:23:45.587
a slightly different syndrome.

00:23:45.587 --> 00:23:48.262
My friend Allan Snyder
in Australia suggested

00:23:48.262 --> 00:23:51.096
this be called Acquired Savantism.

00:23:51.096 --> 00:23:53.097
And so, these are people who did not have

00:23:53.097 --> 00:23:55.712
artistic abilities or talents who

00:23:55.712 --> 00:23:58.845
in the setting of
neurodegenerative diseases

00:23:58.845 --> 00:24:00.991
have acquired new artistic abilities,

00:24:00.991 --> 00:24:04.884
and this is a group that
I lead in San Francisco.

00:24:04.884 --> 00:24:07.680
And almost everybody in that audience

00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:10.930
has helped me in some way in this work.

00:24:12.716 --> 00:24:17.121
We know a lot about art
in the brain from lesions

00:24:17.121 --> 00:24:21.808
whether it's brain tumors,
strokes, brain trauma

00:24:21.808 --> 00:24:25.241
and there are certain
themes that have emerged.

00:24:25.241 --> 00:24:28.954
One is that the right
posterior parts of the brain,

00:24:28.954 --> 00:24:31.197
parietal lobe in particular

00:24:31.197 --> 00:24:34.136
are essentially for the ability to copy,

00:24:34.136 --> 00:24:37.458
and probably along with
the right temporal lobe

00:24:37.458 --> 00:24:41.625
conjure up images that we wanna
put on a piece of a paper.

00:24:43.049 --> 00:24:46.139
The smallest lesion in that brain area

00:24:46.139 --> 00:24:48.972
will devastate the ability to copy

00:24:50.274 --> 00:24:53.973
not as bad as Dan's artwork
but along that spectrum.

00:24:53.973 --> 00:24:57.668
(audience laughs)
Yeah, okay.

00:24:57.668 --> 00:24:58.637
A little bit less known,

00:24:58.637 --> 00:25:01.418
I'm gonna touch on this today about the

00:25:01.418 --> 00:25:02.457
left side of the brain

00:25:02.457 --> 00:25:06.472
but in general the senses that symbolic,

00:25:06.472 --> 00:25:09.519
linguistic, conceptual aspects of art

00:25:09.519 --> 00:25:12.519
are associated with left hemisphere.

00:25:13.968 --> 00:25:16.860
And with the injury to
that part of the brain

00:25:16.860 --> 00:25:20.751
there is a theme in the
literature of preservation

00:25:20.751 --> 00:25:22.668
of the ability to copy.

00:25:24.556 --> 00:25:28.162
I began to study this not
because I thought about it

00:25:28.162 --> 00:25:30.662
because it sort of ran into me

00:25:31.625 --> 00:25:33.829
in the study of patients that I've seen

00:25:33.829 --> 00:25:35.505
with neurodegenerative disease.

00:25:35.505 --> 00:25:39.338
And I was taught going
into my fellowship that

00:25:40.433 --> 00:25:43.183
degenerative diseases
hit the brain diffusely.

00:25:43.183 --> 00:25:47.340
You could learn nothing about
the functions of the brain

00:25:47.340 --> 00:25:49.722
from studying neurodegenerative diseases

00:25:49.722 --> 00:25:51.438
but I think we've known really

00:25:51.438 --> 00:25:54.818
since the time of Pick and Alzheimer that

00:25:54.818 --> 00:25:59.130
we have two major presenile
neurodegenerative conditions.

00:25:59.130 --> 00:26:03.012
One that affects the
front part of the brain

00:26:03.012 --> 00:26:05.775
often begins in the fronto-insular

00:26:05.775 --> 00:26:10.503
and sometimes anterior temporal
lobes, that's shown in blue.

00:26:10.503 --> 00:26:12.502
These are disorders that are called

00:26:12.502 --> 00:26:15.082
frontotemporal dementias.

00:26:15.082 --> 00:26:18.415
They have a lack of Alzheimer pathology,

00:26:19.575 --> 00:26:21.604
no plaques or tangles.

00:26:21.604 --> 00:26:25.983
Then Alzheimer's usually
posteriorly predominant disease

00:26:25.983 --> 00:26:27.889
that affects the hippocampus.

00:26:27.889 --> 00:26:30.495
So, very different anatomy

00:26:30.495 --> 00:26:33.143
and very different sorts of syndromes

00:26:33.143 --> 00:26:36.188
that we see in the setting of these two

00:26:36.188 --> 00:26:39.639
distinctive neurodegenerative conditions.

00:26:39.639 --> 00:26:41.123
There's been a lot written about

00:26:41.123 --> 00:26:43.595
art and Alzheimer's disease.

00:26:43.595 --> 00:26:47.868
Many people get quite a
bit of pleasure working in

00:26:47.868 --> 00:26:51.549
with art therapists with
Alzheimer's disease.

00:26:51.549 --> 00:26:55.481
And I think what these
disorders tell you is that

00:26:55.481 --> 00:26:57.951
your art is influenced
by the part of the brain

00:26:57.951 --> 00:26:59.284
that is injured.

00:27:00.174 --> 00:27:03.108
Because Alzheimer's disease hits the

00:27:03.108 --> 00:27:05.521
posterior temporal parietal regions,

00:27:05.521 --> 00:27:07.927
sometimes worse on the
right than the left,

00:27:07.927 --> 00:27:10.912
sometimes left worse than the right.

00:27:10.912 --> 00:27:12.495
You lose precision,

00:27:13.644 --> 00:27:16.873
there tends to be visuospatial difficulty

00:27:16.873 --> 00:27:21.621
but some things remain,
ability to perceive color,

00:27:21.621 --> 00:27:25.376
simple shapes, this is one
of my patient's painting.

00:27:25.376 --> 00:27:26.876
This is Megan Fox.

00:27:28.139 --> 00:27:30.164
I think quite a beautiful piece,

00:27:30.164 --> 00:27:32.039
a very nice use of color

00:27:32.039 --> 00:27:34.490
I think very typical of what we see

00:27:34.490 --> 00:27:37.020
in the setting of Alzheimer's disease.

00:27:37.020 --> 00:27:40.687
And of course, fine
artists like de Kooning,

00:27:41.609 --> 00:27:45.473
William Utermohlen were
profoundly disrupted

00:27:45.473 --> 00:27:49.640
in their ability to produce
images of complex phases,

00:27:51.639 --> 00:27:55.490
complex shape and were
left with very simple,

00:27:55.490 --> 00:27:58.174
simple forms like this.

00:27:58.174 --> 00:28:01.924
In frontotemporal dementia
there's a different sort of story

00:28:01.924 --> 00:28:05.007
and this is a paper we wrote in 1998.

00:28:06.446 --> 00:28:10.178
Focused on the emergence
of new artistic skills

00:28:10.178 --> 00:28:12.779
after the disease onset.

00:28:12.779 --> 00:28:16.757
The theme was that visual
creativity was more common

00:28:16.757 --> 00:28:18.950
when the anterior temporal lobes

00:28:18.950 --> 00:28:21.439
or the left frontal lobe was where

00:28:21.439 --> 00:28:23.989
the focal degeneration began.

00:28:23.989 --> 00:28:27.693
These are often called
primary progressive aphasias

00:28:27.693 --> 00:28:30.096
because they affect language

00:28:30.096 --> 00:28:32.284
but remarkably in some individuals,

00:28:32.284 --> 00:28:35.898
we see an emergence of visual creativity.

00:28:35.898 --> 00:28:38.217
Wrote about that in 1998.

00:28:38.217 --> 00:28:41.504
I didn't understand the
mechanism very well.

00:28:41.504 --> 00:28:43.439
Starting to understand the circuitry

00:28:43.439 --> 00:28:46.822
that we think emerges
in the setting of this

00:28:46.822 --> 00:28:50.489
loss of function in the
dominant hemisphere.

00:28:51.664 --> 00:28:53.934
This was a patient, Jack,

00:28:53.934 --> 00:28:56.252
that got me interested in this story.

00:28:56.252 --> 00:28:58.462
He was a banker, he
lived in Santa Barbara.

00:28:58.462 --> 00:29:01.664
They did a special on him on ABC News

00:29:01.664 --> 00:29:05.399
and Jack had never had the
slightest interest in art.

00:29:05.399 --> 00:29:08.465
In the 1980s his wife
died, he became depressed,

00:29:08.465 --> 00:29:11.142
he started working with an art therapist

00:29:11.142 --> 00:29:12.892
and started painting.

00:29:14.092 --> 00:29:17.706
What I learned about Jack
is he painted repetitively,

00:29:17.706 --> 00:29:20.762
he did many of the pictures that I saw

00:29:20.762 --> 00:29:22.964
over and over again.

00:29:22.964 --> 00:29:25.968
This compulsive need to paint

00:29:25.968 --> 00:29:28.180
I think was one of the
reasons that his painting

00:29:28.180 --> 00:29:31.346
was so interesting and successful.

00:29:31.346 --> 00:29:34.469
This is I think one of his masterpieces.

00:29:34.469 --> 00:29:36.719
When I saw him around 1995,

00:29:38.369 --> 00:29:41.235
Jack was obsessed with painting

00:29:41.235 --> 00:29:44.248
profoundly aphasic head loss.

00:29:44.248 --> 00:29:47.415
Many of the words, particularly nouns.

00:29:48.535 --> 00:29:52.872
He drew this parrot that
he remembered from Hawaii

00:29:52.872 --> 00:29:56.251
yet couldn't tell me
what this painting was.

00:29:56.251 --> 00:29:59.833
Obsessed with the colors
purple and yellow.

00:29:59.833 --> 00:30:02.404
Like many of these
patients completely unable

00:30:02.404 --> 00:30:05.705
to get him to describe the art of creating

00:30:05.705 --> 00:30:07.407
or why he did it.

00:30:07.407 --> 00:30:11.280
The phrases I heard
over and over again was

00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:13.863
yellow and purple wave over me.

00:30:15.015 --> 00:30:16.938
He became obsessed with painting.

00:30:16.938 --> 00:30:19.244
He painted purple things and yellow things

00:30:19.244 --> 00:30:20.881
over and over again.

00:30:20.881 --> 00:30:24.182
Progressively lost social
skills and language.

00:30:24.182 --> 00:30:27.325
Visually profoundly preoccupied.

00:30:27.325 --> 00:30:30.036
Jack used to walk the
streets of Santa Barbara

00:30:30.036 --> 00:30:32.893
with his caretaker looking for coins.

00:30:32.893 --> 00:30:35.831
When I visited him in Santa Barbara

00:30:35.831 --> 00:30:37.446
I was sitting at the table,

00:30:37.446 --> 00:30:39.623
immediately he says, "It's raining."

00:30:39.623 --> 00:30:43.790
Now he had an uncanny I think
ability to focus visually.

00:30:46.145 --> 00:30:49.097
Jack produced these series of paintings.

00:30:49.097 --> 00:30:50.623
This is a slightly later one.

00:30:50.623 --> 00:30:53.556
I think very fauvist in style.

00:30:53.556 --> 00:30:56.061
You can see an interesting strategy

00:30:56.061 --> 00:31:00.057
where the sail is both the
background and the sail.

00:31:00.057 --> 00:31:03.226
Losing some of the precision that he had

00:31:03.226 --> 00:31:05.265
I think is the disease that creeps

00:31:05.265 --> 00:31:09.022
into the parietal lobes more posteriorly.

00:31:09.022 --> 00:31:12.033
A slightly later piece where he is really

00:31:12.033 --> 00:31:15.070
losing the ability in the
way an Alzheimer patient

00:31:15.070 --> 00:31:16.903
might paint precisely.

00:31:17.910 --> 00:31:21.806
Again that theme of purple
and yellow, Jack's obsession.

00:31:21.806 --> 00:31:25.029
And then finally one of the
last pieces he ever did,

00:31:25.029 --> 00:31:29.604
I think quite whimsical,
beautiful picture of a man.

00:31:29.604 --> 00:31:31.819
As he lost the ability to paint

00:31:31.819 --> 00:31:35.141
this was replaced by the
compulsion to brush his teeth.

00:31:35.141 --> 00:31:37.982
He did this over and over again

00:31:37.982 --> 00:31:40.370
and as we learned later,

00:31:40.370 --> 00:31:43.080
Jack had a form of
frontotemporal dementia,

00:31:43.080 --> 00:31:47.457
very interesting form that has
been called semantic dementia

00:31:47.457 --> 00:31:52.284
or semantic variant of
primary progressive aphasia.

00:31:52.284 --> 00:31:54.138
It's a subtype of frontotemporal dementia.

00:31:54.138 --> 00:31:57.098
It was what Pick described in 1892.

00:31:57.098 --> 00:32:01.248
It affects predominantly the
two anterior temporal lobes.

00:32:01.248 --> 00:32:02.851
When it affects the left side

00:32:02.851 --> 00:32:06.531
which most of my artists
come from this group

00:32:06.531 --> 00:32:10.286
you lose your knowledge about words.

00:32:10.286 --> 00:32:13.184
You lose your knowledge eventually

00:32:13.184 --> 00:32:15.703
about things in the world.

00:32:15.703 --> 00:32:17.312
Unlike Alzheimer's disease,

00:32:17.312 --> 00:32:20.293
the naming deficit
isn't improved by clues.

00:32:20.293 --> 00:32:23.271
They don't know what that word means.

00:32:23.271 --> 00:32:25.438
The anatomy is very focal.

00:32:26.384 --> 00:32:30.490
I think as these individuals lose function

00:32:30.490 --> 00:32:34.013
in the amygdala anterior temporal lobes

00:32:34.013 --> 00:32:35.614
orbital frontal cortex,

00:32:35.614 --> 00:32:39.623
there's disinhibition,
progressive language disturbance

00:32:39.623 --> 00:32:43.079
but often visuospatial
skills are profoundly spared.

00:32:43.079 --> 00:32:47.116
These are people whose only
point on a cognitive test

00:32:47.116 --> 00:32:50.721
is drawing a complex visual figure.

00:32:50.721 --> 00:32:55.208
This is something that is often
spared in these individuals

00:32:55.208 --> 00:32:58.157
and in a subgroup there is a new emergence

00:32:58.157 --> 00:33:02.324
of interest in painting and
increased visual creativity.

00:33:03.816 --> 00:33:06.664
I always thought this was first
described by a neurologist

00:33:06.664 --> 00:33:09.747
but on a trip to Colombia around 2006

00:33:11.743 --> 00:33:13.915
I was reading A Hundred Years of Solitude

00:33:13.915 --> 00:33:16.173
by Gabriel Garcia Marquez

00:33:16.173 --> 00:33:18.697
and I came across his description.

00:33:18.697 --> 00:33:22.203
The first description of semantic dementia

00:33:22.203 --> 00:33:24.083
I think in the literature.

00:33:24.083 --> 00:33:25.479
It's the town of Macondo,

00:33:25.479 --> 00:33:28.535
people are dying of a sleeping sickness

00:33:28.535 --> 00:33:31.982
and he describes what happens to them.

00:33:31.982 --> 00:33:33.943
He discovered he had trouble remembering

00:33:33.943 --> 00:33:36.995
every object in the laboratory.

00:33:36.995 --> 00:33:38.352
He didn't know what they were.

00:33:38.352 --> 00:33:40.454
He marked them with their respective names

00:33:40.454 --> 00:33:43.386
so that all he had to do
was read the inscription

00:33:43.386 --> 00:33:45.125
in order to identify them.

00:33:45.125 --> 00:33:46.249
This is the cow.

00:33:46.249 --> 00:33:47.900
She must be milk every morning

00:33:47.900 --> 00:33:49.770
so that she will produce milk,

00:33:49.770 --> 00:33:50.999
and the milk must be boiled

00:33:50.999 --> 00:33:53.875
in order to be mixed with coffee.

00:33:53.875 --> 00:33:55.580
A gorgeous description.

00:33:55.580 --> 00:33:58.913
They went on living in a
reality that was slipping away

00:33:58.913 --> 00:34:01.252
momentarily captured by words

00:34:01.252 --> 00:34:04.050
but which would escape irremediably

00:34:04.050 --> 00:34:07.498
when they forgot the
values of written letters.

00:34:07.498 --> 00:34:10.531
Around the time that I
discovered this piece

00:34:10.531 --> 00:34:12.967
from Gabriel Garcia Marquez,

00:34:12.967 --> 00:34:17.916
we had a patient very much
like the villager in Macondo.

00:34:17.916 --> 00:34:21.501
This is my patient Bob who
like many of these individuals

00:34:21.501 --> 00:34:23.352
know that they're losing words,

00:34:23.352 --> 00:34:26.465
know that they're losing
knowledge about facts

00:34:26.465 --> 00:34:27.665
in their world.

00:34:27.665 --> 00:34:31.832
And you can see here just like
Garcia Marquez' description

00:34:34.157 --> 00:34:35.894
he's putting down these names,

00:34:35.894 --> 00:34:39.014
these words, compulsively, repetitively,

00:34:39.014 --> 00:34:41.431
Foley catheter, endocarditis.

00:34:42.687 --> 00:34:45.230
He knows that his world is slipping away

00:34:45.230 --> 00:34:48.123
just in the way Gabriel
Garcia Marquez described it.

00:34:48.123 --> 00:34:51.509
I don't think and be
glad to talk about this

00:34:51.509 --> 00:34:53.526
with anyone online, offline,

00:34:53.526 --> 00:34:56.799
that Marquez actually saw a
case of semantic dementia.

00:34:56.799 --> 00:34:59.927
I think he was writing
about his own writer's block

00:34:59.927 --> 00:35:04.136
and I think this is what he
conceptualized at the time.

00:35:04.136 --> 00:35:06.853
We couldn't resist, this is Bob's

00:35:06.853 --> 00:35:09.696
who drew a cow quite beautifully.

00:35:09.696 --> 00:35:12.590
His elephant I think rather whimsical.

00:35:12.590 --> 00:35:14.629
Certainly better than Dan and I could do

00:35:14.629 --> 00:35:16.086
I think in the copy so, yeah.

00:35:16.086 --> 00:35:18.010
(audience laughs)

00:35:18.010 --> 00:35:20.598
This is a degenerative disease.

00:35:20.598 --> 00:35:25.008
The concepts for these
animals often nouns first,

00:35:25.008 --> 00:35:27.797
verbs relatively spared.

00:35:27.797 --> 00:35:29.619
Look like they come out of evolution.

00:35:29.619 --> 00:35:32.757
I appreciated the picture
of Darwin earlier.

00:35:32.757 --> 00:35:36.535
The dog looks a little bit like a cat.

00:35:36.535 --> 00:35:40.101
It looks like some features of a cow

00:35:40.101 --> 00:35:43.704
as similarly the cat
has features of the dog.

00:35:43.704 --> 00:35:47.510
The fish to me looks
very much like a penguin

00:35:47.510 --> 00:35:50.327
but I think as you're watching

00:35:50.327 --> 00:35:53.072
this patient with semantic dementia

00:35:53.072 --> 00:35:56.025
lose their conceptual knowledge around

00:35:56.025 --> 00:35:58.876
what distinctive animals really are.

00:35:58.876 --> 00:36:01.706
And of course if you don't
know what an animal is

00:36:01.706 --> 00:36:04.379
you don't know what color to give it.

00:36:04.379 --> 00:36:07.443
We asked this patient to draw the frog

00:36:07.443 --> 00:36:09.475
and put the color in.

00:36:09.475 --> 00:36:13.642
He drew a pink frog, not the
green one which he should.

00:36:14.977 --> 00:36:18.994
This is my latest favorite set of pieces.

00:36:18.994 --> 00:36:21.656
This is gentleman who we're gonna describe

00:36:21.656 --> 00:36:23.406
for the journal JAMA.

00:36:24.915 --> 00:36:28.382
He became obsessed with welding.

00:36:28.382 --> 00:36:30.135
He was not an artist.

00:36:30.135 --> 00:36:33.135
This is his bird and you can see

00:36:33.135 --> 00:36:37.218
it has got that same
quality of a mixed metaphor.

00:36:39.707 --> 00:36:43.008
The bird has features of an insect

00:36:43.008 --> 00:36:46.730
and I think this really has taught me that

00:36:46.730 --> 00:36:49.874
what an artist does is
put down on a canvas

00:36:49.874 --> 00:36:53.041
the way that they see the world, okay.

00:36:54.085 --> 00:36:57.085
So, just a couple conclusion points.

00:36:58.648 --> 00:37:02.764
Our poet laureate Kay
Ryan from Marin County

00:37:02.764 --> 00:37:05.879
has taught us at the UCSF about

00:37:05.879 --> 00:37:08.339
the neuroscientist Emily Dickinson.

00:37:08.339 --> 00:37:12.381
And I think Emily Dickinson
had a very modern way

00:37:12.381 --> 00:37:14.067
of thinking about the brain.

00:37:14.067 --> 00:37:16.589
And so when I was thinking
about these patients

00:37:16.589 --> 00:37:19.436
I came across this poem by her

00:37:19.436 --> 00:37:22.804
and I think she was
interested in moral decay

00:37:22.804 --> 00:37:26.052
but this is really the decay
of neurodegenerative diseases

00:37:26.052 --> 00:37:28.385
as we understand it in 2017.

00:37:29.450 --> 00:37:32.512
Crumbling or the dementia
is not an instant act

00:37:32.512 --> 00:37:35.679
and we now know probably 20 years

00:37:35.679 --> 00:37:38.736
before we see a patient
with one of these diseases

00:37:38.736 --> 00:37:41.504
that the degenerative process has begun.

00:37:41.504 --> 00:37:44.633
A fundamental pause,
dilapidation's processes

00:37:44.633 --> 00:37:46.886
are organized decays.

00:37:46.886 --> 00:37:49.395
Totally contradicts the idea that the

00:37:49.395 --> 00:37:51.878
dementias hit the brain diffusely.

00:37:51.878 --> 00:37:55.192
These are organized decays
in very specific circuits.

00:37:55.192 --> 00:37:56.950
Other circuits are spared.

00:37:56.950 --> 00:37:58.800
'Tis first a Cobweb on the Soul,

00:37:58.800 --> 00:38:01.969
this is the misfolded
protein that Rusty Gage,

00:38:01.969 --> 00:38:05.217
Dan Geschwind talk and write about.

00:38:05.217 --> 00:38:07.838
Cuticle of Dust, a Borer in the Axis,

00:38:07.838 --> 00:38:09.238
an Elemental Rust.

00:38:09.238 --> 00:38:13.046
Ruin is formal, Devil's
work, consecutive and slow.

00:38:13.046 --> 00:38:15.043
Fail in an instant, no man did,

00:38:15.043 --> 00:38:18.549
slipping or the dementing
process is Crash's law.

00:38:18.549 --> 00:38:20.379
We see the crash but I think

00:38:20.379 --> 00:38:22.945
what these artists have told me is that

00:38:22.945 --> 00:38:27.059
there is a period when
this process is beginning

00:38:27.059 --> 00:38:28.810
where certain parts of the brain

00:38:28.810 --> 00:38:30.393
may be particularly

00:38:32.968 --> 00:38:36.396
immune to the degenerative process.

00:38:36.396 --> 00:38:39.902
They are spared and
possibly begin to remodel

00:38:39.902 --> 00:38:43.289
and we've written a little bit about this

00:38:43.289 --> 00:38:46.822
describing an artist named Ann Adams.

00:38:46.822 --> 00:38:49.863
The conclusion is it's I think a beautiful

00:38:49.863 --> 00:38:51.841
but also a very sad story.

00:38:51.841 --> 00:38:53.698
Artistic creativity may emerge

00:38:53.698 --> 00:38:56.195
with left hemisphere dysfunction.

00:38:56.195 --> 00:38:59.749
I think we have some data
from the artist Ann Adams

00:38:59.749 --> 00:39:03.916
that there is rewiring of right
posterior parietal regions.

00:39:05.492 --> 00:39:08.817
Very area that Karen Berman showed as

00:39:08.817 --> 00:39:13.271
probably dysfunctional and
kids with Williams syndrome.

00:39:13.271 --> 00:39:18.030
Insights into the degenerative
process suggest that

00:39:18.030 --> 00:39:21.456
sometimes a new strength may herald

00:39:21.456 --> 00:39:23.892
the degenerative process

00:39:23.892 --> 00:39:25.944
but I think understanding
people's strengths

00:39:25.944 --> 00:39:28.430
are critical for diagnosis and care.

00:39:28.430 --> 00:39:30.314
And I think also this gives us insight

00:39:30.314 --> 00:39:34.376
into our humanity and almost
everyone has touched on this.

00:39:34.376 --> 00:39:37.256
Brain assymetry is at
the core of our strengths

00:39:37.256 --> 00:39:39.471
but also the core of our weaknesses,

00:39:39.471 --> 00:39:41.135
so, thank you.

00:39:41.135 --> 00:39:44.135
(audience clapping)

00:39:45.567 --> 00:39:48.105
- People with synaesthesia
experience the ordinary world

00:39:48.105 --> 00:39:50.586
in quite extraordinary ways.

00:39:50.586 --> 00:39:52.909
For some people when they
look at letters on a page

00:39:52.909 --> 00:39:55.530
each letter might have
its own distinctive color

00:39:55.530 --> 00:39:58.157
which either appears in
the synaesthete's mind eye

00:39:58.157 --> 00:40:00.160
or is perhaps projected on to the page

00:40:00.160 --> 00:40:02.755
on top of the regular text.

00:40:02.755 --> 00:40:06.864
Further, synaesthete's time
and the calendar for example

00:40:06.864 --> 00:40:09.288
or numbers are seen visuospatially

00:40:09.288 --> 00:40:11.536
as kind of an undulating landscape.

00:40:11.536 --> 00:40:14.630
And this might serve as a memory aid.

00:40:14.630 --> 00:40:17.558
For example, we see it
in the case of Jill Price

00:40:17.558 --> 00:40:18.912
that was presented earlier.

00:40:18.912 --> 00:40:21.987
Not only has she got fantastic
autobiographical memory

00:40:21.987 --> 00:40:24.825
she perceives the years
in terms of her own

00:40:24.825 --> 00:40:27.773
internal landscape of time.

00:40:27.773 --> 00:40:30.510
This is one of my first
case studies of synaesthesia

00:40:30.510 --> 00:40:32.714
and this is a man who tastes words.

00:40:32.714 --> 00:40:34.522
As he's listening to me speaking now

00:40:34.522 --> 00:40:37.944
each word might have its own
distinct flavor on his mouth

00:40:37.944 --> 00:40:40.077
and this is his representation

00:40:40.077 --> 00:40:42.986
of the London Tube map, the Underground.

00:40:42.986 --> 00:40:46.496
And words for him might taste
of celery or sausage meat.

00:40:46.496 --> 00:40:48.477
He grew up in Britain in the 1960s

00:40:48.477 --> 00:40:51.947
where this was your quintessential
kind of diet growing up.

00:40:51.947 --> 00:40:55.656
He's internalized this
in his synaesthesia.

00:40:55.656 --> 00:40:57.967
One of the first case studies

00:40:57.967 --> 00:41:00.758
that points to extraordinary
ability in synaesthesia

00:41:00.758 --> 00:41:03.716
is this book by Luria called
The Mind of A Mnemonist

00:41:03.716 --> 00:41:05.347
and this is somebody who's described

00:41:05.347 --> 00:41:06.997
as having an infinite memory

00:41:06.997 --> 00:41:09.502
who never forgets things,
who can remember sequences

00:41:09.502 --> 00:41:12.068
of abstract syllables
that are presented to him

00:41:12.068 --> 00:41:14.026
and then recalls them years later.

00:41:14.026 --> 00:41:18.172
And also has phenomenal
autobiographical memory as well.

00:41:18.172 --> 00:41:19.602
As well as having amazing memory,

00:41:19.602 --> 00:41:21.904
he also had various kinds of synaesthesia

00:41:21.904 --> 00:41:24.982
so numbers would elicit colors.

00:41:24.982 --> 00:41:26.492
The sound of somebody's voice

00:41:26.492 --> 00:41:29.510
would have both colors, taste and touch.

00:41:29.510 --> 00:41:33.343
He had a multiplicity of
different kinds of synaesthesia.

00:41:33.343 --> 00:41:35.295
And this is a case that
we already heard about

00:41:35.295 --> 00:41:39.103
who has both synaesthesia
and Asperger syndrome,

00:41:39.103 --> 00:41:41.126
high functioning autism.

00:41:41.126 --> 00:41:44.323
Daniel could recite pi
to 20,000 decimal places,

00:41:44.323 --> 00:41:46.370
a feat which takes around five hours

00:41:46.370 --> 00:41:48.724
just to say the digits aloud.

00:41:48.724 --> 00:41:50.644
But what he's doing
when he's recalling them

00:41:50.644 --> 00:41:52.479
is also extraordinary

00:41:52.479 --> 00:41:55.750
because for him the digits
is not just a verbal string,

00:41:55.750 --> 00:41:58.138
it's a visuospatial
string that he reads off

00:41:58.138 --> 00:41:59.469
in his mind's eye.

00:41:59.469 --> 00:42:03.160
And this is his representation
of the first 20 digits of pi.

00:42:03.160 --> 00:42:06.046
For him each digit has
its own particular color

00:42:06.046 --> 00:42:07.542
and its own particular texture

00:42:07.542 --> 00:42:09.159
and its own position in the sequence

00:42:09.159 --> 00:42:13.086
that he reads off as he's
recollecting the sequence.

00:42:13.086 --> 00:42:14.537
These are extraordinary cases,

00:42:14.537 --> 00:42:17.436
is synaesthesia in general
linked to enhanced memory

00:42:17.436 --> 00:42:20.009
and if so why might this be?

00:42:20.009 --> 00:42:22.669
What we know about
synaesthetes is that they have

00:42:22.669 --> 00:42:23.990
differences in their brain

00:42:23.990 --> 00:42:25.921
although these aren't well-characterized,

00:42:25.921 --> 00:42:29.246
it's more gray matter and more
white matter organization.

00:42:29.246 --> 00:42:32.905
At least patchy within some regions.

00:42:32.905 --> 00:42:35.050
One possibility is that
you could use synaesthesia

00:42:35.050 --> 00:42:36.588
as a kind of a memory aid.

00:42:36.588 --> 00:42:38.370
If you see words spelled out

00:42:38.370 --> 00:42:40.758
that it might help you to remember them.

00:42:40.758 --> 00:42:43.952
You're using your synaesthesia
as a kind of cognitive tool.

00:42:43.952 --> 00:42:45.398
The other possibility is that it's

00:42:45.398 --> 00:42:47.923
something about the
brain changes themselves

00:42:47.923 --> 00:42:50.545
that give rise not only to synaesthesia

00:42:50.545 --> 00:42:54.543
but also give rise to other
particular cognitive phenotypes

00:42:54.543 --> 00:42:56.330
such as enhanced memory

00:42:56.330 --> 00:42:57.749
and allowed you in favor of this

00:42:57.749 --> 00:43:00.878
to present various lines of evidence.

00:43:00.878 --> 00:43:03.306
First of all if we look
at the memory ability

00:43:03.306 --> 00:43:04.418
of people with synaesthesia,

00:43:04.418 --> 00:43:07.525
these are people who experience
words and letters as colored

00:43:07.525 --> 00:43:10.042
and we would give them a
standard recognition memory test

00:43:10.042 --> 00:43:11.559
in which we present them with a sequence

00:43:11.559 --> 00:43:14.227
of say 30 words to remember.

00:43:14.227 --> 00:43:17.102
And then we a test we
present them with 60 words,

00:43:17.102 --> 00:43:20.083
half of which they saw before
and half of which they didn't.

00:43:20.083 --> 00:43:24.250
And we made them visually
similar to try and confuse them

00:43:25.230 --> 00:43:26.952
and of course they were
presented in a random order

00:43:26.952 --> 00:43:28.889
not consecutively like this.

00:43:28.889 --> 00:43:30.664
But at the end we also ask what strategy

00:43:30.664 --> 00:43:32.667
did they use for memorizing them.

00:43:32.667 --> 00:43:34.398
And actually when you back sort people

00:43:34.398 --> 00:43:36.158
by the kind of strategy they have

00:43:36.158 --> 00:43:38.939
yes, these kind of semantic associations

00:43:38.939 --> 00:43:40.094
have a best strategy

00:43:40.094 --> 00:43:42.491
but it doesn't make any
difference what strategy you use.

00:43:42.491 --> 00:43:44.761
If you're a synaesthete you do better

00:43:44.761 --> 00:43:46.673
on this particular test.

00:43:46.673 --> 00:43:48.511
Another way of doing it with another group

00:43:48.511 --> 00:43:50.121
is that you actually give them a strategy,

00:43:50.121 --> 00:43:52.253
so one is that you can process it deeply.

00:43:52.253 --> 00:43:54.181
You make semantic judgements about words

00:43:54.181 --> 00:43:55.370
such as whether it's living

00:43:55.370 --> 00:43:57.493
and the other words you
process it shallowly.

00:43:57.493 --> 00:43:59.419
You ask about the letters in the word.

00:43:59.419 --> 00:44:00.882
And again, whether or not you process it

00:44:00.882 --> 00:44:02.286
shallowly or deeply,

00:44:02.286 --> 00:44:05.662
synaesthetes have better
memory for words here

00:44:05.662 --> 00:44:09.110
and they produce fewer false alarms,

00:44:09.110 --> 00:44:11.344
misrecognitions of them.

00:44:11.344 --> 00:44:12.891
Here these are verbal stimuli

00:44:12.891 --> 00:44:14.498
that for these people elicit colors.

00:44:14.498 --> 00:44:18.907
What about if you look at
nonverbal visual stimuli?

00:44:18.907 --> 00:44:21.998
These are some of the kinds
of stimuli that we presented.

00:44:21.998 --> 00:44:23.923
Again here we would have scenes

00:44:23.923 --> 00:44:25.406
so we would present them with say

00:44:25.406 --> 00:44:27.892
a series of 30 scenes and then a test,

00:44:27.892 --> 00:44:29.306
we'd present them with the same scenes

00:44:29.306 --> 00:44:32.959
and ones that are very similar
just a little bit different.

00:44:32.959 --> 00:44:35.740
Or also fractals of very abstract images

00:44:35.740 --> 00:44:37.187
which people find very hard,

00:44:37.187 --> 00:44:39.245
they're very hard to recode verbally

00:44:39.245 --> 00:44:41.958
or in any other particular way.

00:44:41.958 --> 00:44:44.558
Or similarly you can have
regular colored scenes

00:44:44.558 --> 00:44:46.190
but you can manipulate them in some way.

00:44:46.190 --> 00:44:49.998
You can reverse it, you can
flip the color for example

00:44:49.998 --> 00:44:52.261
or you can make objects
appear or disappear.

00:44:52.261 --> 00:44:55.295
This is again a difficult memory test.

00:44:55.295 --> 00:44:58.114
What we find here is that
synaesthetes outperform controls.

00:44:58.114 --> 00:45:00.095
Here what we've got is effect size.

00:45:00.095 --> 00:45:03.273
This is a measure of
the relative advantage

00:45:03.273 --> 00:45:05.408
of synaesthetes over controls.

00:45:05.408 --> 00:45:07.751
Typically they have medium effect sizes

00:45:07.751 --> 00:45:10.499
but actually they do much
better for visual material

00:45:10.499 --> 00:45:11.759
over verbal material

00:45:11.759 --> 00:45:14.127
even though the visual
material is not triggering

00:45:14.127 --> 00:45:17.566
any extra experiences for these people.

00:45:17.566 --> 00:45:19.753
They describe thinking in visual images.

00:45:19.753 --> 00:45:22.449
For them they think in very sensory ways

00:45:22.449 --> 00:45:26.616
remembering events as like
reliving it in your mind's eye.

00:45:27.548 --> 00:45:29.271
And for some things they
do particularly well.

00:45:29.271 --> 00:45:30.446
Notice for the fractals

00:45:30.446 --> 00:45:32.145
that's actually one of their best things

00:45:32.145 --> 00:45:35.014
and these are very hard for
people typically to remember.

00:45:35.014 --> 00:45:38.532
They can hold on to
visual patterns very well.

00:45:38.532 --> 00:45:40.659
What I would argue here is that

00:45:40.659 --> 00:45:43.222
synaesthesia is linked to enhanced memory

00:45:43.222 --> 00:45:45.720
but although you might sometimes use

00:45:45.720 --> 00:45:47.450
synaesthesia as a memory aid,

00:45:47.450 --> 00:45:49.591
it's probably something more fundamental

00:45:49.591 --> 00:45:51.917
in terms of the way that
their brain is wired,

00:45:51.917 --> 00:45:55.899
in terms of holding on to
visual and sensory information

00:45:55.899 --> 00:45:58.336
for example in this stimuli.

00:45:58.336 --> 00:46:00.188
What you'll also see in these studies

00:46:00.188 --> 00:46:03.039
is that synaesthetes do
well on lab test on memory

00:46:03.039 --> 00:46:05.035
but actually their memory
isn't so phenomenal

00:46:05.035 --> 00:46:09.587
that they're going to produce
jaw-dropping feats at a party.

00:46:09.587 --> 00:46:10.837
And some of my colleagues have said

00:46:10.837 --> 00:46:13.235
well, hang on, this means
that these exceptional cases

00:46:13.235 --> 00:46:15.197
that we've talked about,
they're anomalies.

00:46:15.197 --> 00:46:16.835
These are the outliers.

00:46:16.835 --> 00:46:19.744
Something different must
be going on in these cases.

00:46:19.744 --> 00:46:21.242
And I've kind of toyed with this idea

00:46:21.242 --> 00:46:23.460
but actually we don't
necessarily need to look

00:46:23.460 --> 00:46:26.177
for a different explanation
for those who have

00:46:26.177 --> 00:46:29.399
a small upward shift and for
those who have a large one.

00:46:29.399 --> 00:46:32.332
And all we have to do is just think about

00:46:32.332 --> 00:46:34.510
the normal distribution.

00:46:34.510 --> 00:46:36.467
Here what you've got is a shift of

00:46:36.467 --> 00:46:37.973
half a standard deviation.

00:46:37.973 --> 00:46:40.597
This is the low end of
the medium effect size.

00:46:40.597 --> 00:46:45.376
Very much the conservative
end of what I presented.

00:46:45.376 --> 00:46:47.881
The synaesthetes are
here in the light blue

00:46:47.881 --> 00:46:49.475
and what you can do is you can slice up

00:46:49.475 --> 00:46:51.199
these normal distribution and ask

00:46:51.199 --> 00:46:54.565
how many people lie in each of these ones.

00:46:54.565 --> 00:46:56.843
Between naught and one standard deviations

00:46:56.843 --> 00:47:01.370
you'll find 38% of synaesthetes
and 34% of control.

00:47:01.370 --> 00:47:03.997
A ratio that favors the synaesthetes.

00:47:03.997 --> 00:47:05.236
But as you move up,

00:47:05.236 --> 00:47:07.372
in fact what you find
is that it's nonlinear.

00:47:07.372 --> 00:47:08.705
The synaesthetes are very much

00:47:08.705 --> 00:47:11.893
overrepresented at the extremes here.

00:47:11.893 --> 00:47:14.561
And if you exceed this, so if you go up to

00:47:14.561 --> 00:47:17.644
an effect size of 0.8 which
again is not unrealistic

00:47:17.644 --> 00:47:19.595
given some of the data I presented,

00:47:19.595 --> 00:47:22.705
you see again that it goes
up quite astonishingly

00:47:22.705 --> 00:47:23.846
the amount of synaesthetes

00:47:23.846 --> 00:47:26.542
that you would expect at the high end.

00:47:26.542 --> 00:47:28.016
If you put it another way

00:47:28.016 --> 00:47:29.954
if you were to give me a thousand people

00:47:29.954 --> 00:47:32.286
and you were to rank
them in terms of their

00:47:32.286 --> 00:47:34.328
memory ability from left to right,

00:47:34.328 --> 00:47:36.237
and you ask me can I find a synaesthete

00:47:36.237 --> 00:47:39.576
amongst that distribution,
where would I look?

00:47:39.576 --> 00:47:41.204
Well, I could look where the mean is

00:47:41.204 --> 00:47:42.327
because that's where most

00:47:42.327 --> 00:47:44.376
of the synaesthetes are numerically.

00:47:44.376 --> 00:47:46.170
But the problem with that
is that you've also got

00:47:46.170 --> 00:47:48.092
an awful lot of non-synaesthetes

00:47:48.092 --> 00:47:50.038
who will be performing at that level.

00:47:50.038 --> 00:47:52.350
The best place to look is actually

00:47:52.350 --> 00:47:54.711
at the 1,000th person on the right

00:47:54.711 --> 00:47:56.841
and statistically that is the person

00:47:56.841 --> 00:47:59.026
most likely to have synaesthesia,

00:47:59.026 --> 00:48:01.856
and you don't need to do the
experiment, it's just maths.

00:48:01.856 --> 00:48:03.910
But the closest experiment we've done

00:48:03.910 --> 00:48:06.397
is to take a group of people who perform

00:48:06.397 --> 00:48:07.856
in memory championships.

00:48:07.856 --> 00:48:11.397
There are world rankings for
doing bizarre things like

00:48:11.397 --> 00:48:14.030
remembering the order of a pack of cards

00:48:14.030 --> 00:48:16.434
in 35 seconds and so on.

00:48:16.434 --> 00:48:19.865
And we were able to test
18 of these memory athletes

00:48:19.865 --> 00:48:22.051
and we checked using a valid measure

00:48:22.051 --> 00:48:23.437
of Grapheme-color synaesthesia,

00:48:23.437 --> 00:48:25.192
the standard one in the literature

00:48:25.192 --> 00:48:28.660
and showed that they, synaesthetes
are very significantly

00:48:28.660 --> 00:48:31.830
overrepresented within this group.

00:48:31.830 --> 00:48:35.070
The prevalence of Grapheme-color
synaesthesia is 1% to 2%.

00:48:35.070 --> 00:48:37.386
Other types of synaesthesia push it up

00:48:37.386 --> 00:48:39.852
and we had a group of controls that we

00:48:39.852 --> 00:48:43.011
tried to select in a similar way.

00:48:43.011 --> 00:48:44.972
We've heard a little bit
about the relationship

00:48:44.972 --> 00:48:46.463
between synaesthesia and autism

00:48:46.463 --> 00:48:48.082
and I came to this quite skeptical.

00:48:48.082 --> 00:48:51.436
Why would these two very
different things be related?

00:48:51.436 --> 00:48:53.149
But they are related.

00:48:53.149 --> 00:48:55.646
Simon Baron-Cohen and a group in Germany

00:48:55.646 --> 00:48:57.353
were the first people to actually show

00:48:57.353 --> 00:49:00.602
that there's an increased incidence of

00:49:00.602 --> 00:49:01.832
synaesthesia and autism.

00:49:01.832 --> 00:49:03.479
So they took a group of people with autism

00:49:03.479 --> 00:49:05.382
and looked for synaesthesia.

00:49:05.382 --> 00:49:08.305
We also did these ourselves
but amongst the autistic people

00:49:08.305 --> 00:49:11.428
we looked to those people who have

00:49:11.428 --> 00:49:13.806
savant trait and those who don't.

00:49:13.806 --> 00:49:15.525
These were all high functioning people

00:49:15.525 --> 00:49:16.569
with autism by the way

00:49:16.569 --> 00:49:20.736
so they're not at the low end
of intellectual disability.

00:49:21.780 --> 00:49:24.744
What we have here, both of
these groups on the left

00:49:24.744 --> 00:49:27.336
have a clinical diagnosis of autism

00:49:27.336 --> 00:49:29.495
but some of the autistic
people are reporting

00:49:29.495 --> 00:49:32.474
savant abilities and this
includes things like perfect pitch

00:49:32.474 --> 00:49:34.453
or calendar calculation.

00:49:34.453 --> 00:49:36.504
And these people here are far more likely

00:49:36.504 --> 00:49:40.473
to have synaesthesia than
the kind of garden-variety

00:49:40.473 --> 00:49:43.409
of people with a diagnosis of autism.

00:49:43.409 --> 00:49:45.410
It is linked to autism
but it seems to be linked

00:49:45.410 --> 00:49:47.544
to special abilities.

00:49:47.544 --> 00:49:49.502
As well as looking for synaesthetic traits

00:49:49.502 --> 00:49:50.766
amongst people with autism

00:49:50.766 --> 00:49:52.497
you can look for autistic traits

00:49:52.497 --> 00:49:54.921
amongst people with synaesthesia.

00:49:54.921 --> 00:49:56.147
One of the things that we did is

00:49:56.147 --> 00:49:59.005
that we took a standard
questionnaire measure of autism

00:49:59.005 --> 00:50:00.692
that has 50 questions,

00:50:00.692 --> 00:50:03.261
and the questions are
divided into five subscales,

00:50:03.261 --> 00:50:05.261
so 10 questions in each.

00:50:06.338 --> 00:50:09.644
Four of the subscales actually
ask about difficulties.

00:50:09.644 --> 00:50:11.118
Things like social skills

00:50:11.118 --> 00:50:14.709
which people with autism find hard.

00:50:14.709 --> 00:50:17.442
But there's one subscale
that asks about abilities

00:50:17.442 --> 00:50:19.489
and that's attention to detail.

00:50:19.489 --> 00:50:22.093
Here this particular
question is reverse coded.

00:50:22.093 --> 00:50:23.445
People with autism are very good

00:50:23.445 --> 00:50:25.658
at finding the proverbial
needle in a haystack.

00:50:25.658 --> 00:50:30.095
They do very good at where's
Waldo kind of puzzles,

00:50:30.095 --> 00:50:33.250
detecting parts and wholes and so on.

00:50:33.250 --> 00:50:35.169
They do good at this.

00:50:35.169 --> 00:50:38.939
If we give this to a group of synaesthetes

00:50:38.939 --> 00:50:42.584
again what we find, so this
is a score from naught to 50.

00:50:42.584 --> 00:50:44.875
Controls are about 18, synaesthetes

00:50:44.875 --> 00:50:47.218
are raised significantly.

00:50:47.218 --> 00:50:49.588
They form quite considerably below the

00:50:49.588 --> 00:50:51.922
average of an autistic person.

00:50:51.922 --> 00:50:53.448
But actually even this shift,

00:50:53.448 --> 00:50:54.988
what this means if you model

00:50:54.988 --> 00:50:56.757
the tail end of the distribution

00:50:56.757 --> 00:50:58.824
is that you would expect
at least twice as many

00:50:58.824 --> 00:51:03.092
synaesthetes to be overrepresented
in the tail than that.

00:51:03.092 --> 00:51:06.646
These small shifts can have
large effects of the tail

00:51:06.646 --> 00:51:09.546
is one of my take home messages.

00:51:09.546 --> 00:51:11.324
Here these are the five subscales

00:51:11.324 --> 00:51:13.627
and it looks complicated but it isn't.

00:51:13.627 --> 00:51:16.453
In the gray bar we got
our group with autism.

00:51:16.453 --> 00:51:18.974
High score means that
you're high on the spectrum.

00:51:18.974 --> 00:51:20.724
In blue you've got your synaesthetes

00:51:20.724 --> 00:51:23.802
and in orange you've got your controls.

00:51:23.802 --> 00:51:26.035
This is social skills here.

00:51:26.035 --> 00:51:28.235
What we can see is that
for four out of five

00:51:28.235 --> 00:51:29.792
of this particular thing,

00:51:29.792 --> 00:51:32.985
the synaesthetes are
indistinguishable from the controls.

00:51:32.985 --> 00:51:34.734
They're a little bit above them.

00:51:34.734 --> 00:51:36.121
But for one out of five,

00:51:36.121 --> 00:51:37.820
the synaesthetes are indistinguishable

00:51:37.820 --> 00:51:39.241
from people with autism,

00:51:39.241 --> 00:51:42.519
and this is in the attention
to detail subscale.

00:51:42.519 --> 00:51:44.898
We subsequently confirmed that using

00:51:44.898 --> 00:51:46.400
what's called a change blindness paradigm

00:51:46.400 --> 00:51:48.618
where you have to note the small changes

00:51:48.618 --> 00:51:51.118
in scenes that are flickering.

00:51:52.933 --> 00:51:55.365
Synaesthesia or sorry,
autism has been defined

00:51:55.365 --> 00:51:56.902
in terms of these impairments

00:51:56.902 --> 00:51:59.828
but in the most recent
psychiatric definition

00:51:59.828 --> 00:52:01.995
they added sensory symptom

00:52:03.572 --> 00:52:06.421
and this was sensory hypersensitivity

00:52:06.421 --> 00:52:08.994
and also maybe hyposensitivities.

00:52:08.994 --> 00:52:11.959
Some of the things might
be finding bright lights

00:52:11.959 --> 00:52:15.020
particularly aversive or giving
you a headache and so on.

00:52:15.020 --> 00:52:18.094
And people have developed
various measures of this.

00:52:18.094 --> 00:52:20.378
Again, initially using a questionnaire.

00:52:20.378 --> 00:52:21.510
This is the one that we used

00:52:21.510 --> 00:52:23.820
the Glasgow sensory questionnaire.

00:52:23.820 --> 00:52:26.534
And what we find here is that synaesthetes

00:52:26.534 --> 00:52:28.620
are significantly above controls

00:52:28.620 --> 00:52:30.485
and numerically similar to people

00:52:30.485 --> 00:52:32.312
with autism on this measure

00:52:32.312 --> 00:52:36.259
despite actually not having
many of the classic signs

00:52:36.259 --> 00:52:37.759
of being autistic.

00:52:38.903 --> 00:52:40.918
We looked at this in more detail.

00:52:40.918 --> 00:52:42.354
Most of the people we've looked at

00:52:42.354 --> 00:52:44.472
are these people with
Grapheme-color synaesthesia

00:52:44.472 --> 00:52:46.809
because we have very obvious ways

00:52:46.809 --> 00:52:49.522
of verifying this in the lab.

00:52:49.522 --> 00:52:51.196
But we can also look at the presence of

00:52:51.196 --> 00:52:52.576
other kind of synaesthesia.

00:52:52.576 --> 00:52:54.885
Those people who see time for example

00:52:54.885 --> 00:52:57.503
in this kind of spatial calendars.

00:52:57.503 --> 00:53:00.594
People who have tastes or
flavors in their mouth,

00:53:00.594 --> 00:53:02.566
people who experience words spelled out

00:53:02.566 --> 00:53:03.831
as they listen to speech.

00:53:03.831 --> 00:53:05.923
Some people see it like ticker tape

00:53:05.923 --> 00:53:09.675
or having visual experiences to music.

00:53:09.675 --> 00:53:12.483
And what we can do in effect is we can

00:53:12.483 --> 00:53:15.559
take people and we just say
how many of these have you got?

00:53:15.559 --> 00:53:18.300
And actually synaesthetes
were asked this question often

00:53:18.300 --> 00:53:19.496
about three or four years ago

00:53:19.496 --> 00:53:22.045
when they first volunteered
and we kept a database

00:53:22.045 --> 00:53:24.315
of that information.

00:53:24.315 --> 00:53:27.410
This is what we find in
terms of sensory sensitivity.

00:53:27.410 --> 00:53:30.014
We have a very clear dose effect between

00:53:30.014 --> 00:53:32.625
how many types of
synaesthesia somebody has

00:53:32.625 --> 00:53:34.380
and how much they report

00:53:34.380 --> 00:53:37.418
sensory sensitivity on this measure.

00:53:37.418 --> 00:53:39.539
This is where people with autism are,

00:53:39.539 --> 00:53:41.252
if you've got zero types of synaesthesia

00:53:41.252 --> 00:53:42.726
you're our control group.

00:53:42.726 --> 00:53:45.329
These are people with
one, two, three and four.

00:53:45.329 --> 00:53:46.574
You can't read this at the bottom

00:53:46.574 --> 00:53:49.031
but these are just different
combinations of that five

00:53:49.031 --> 00:53:50.449
but you don't need to read it.

00:53:50.449 --> 00:53:52.057
If you have three types of synaesthesia

00:53:52.057 --> 00:53:56.224
that is your level of sensory
sensitivity on this measure.

00:53:57.305 --> 00:53:59.888
And this is the proportion
of people in these groups

00:53:59.888 --> 00:54:03.241
who are the high end
of the autism spectrum.

00:54:03.241 --> 00:54:05.831
People with autism on this measure

00:54:05.831 --> 00:54:08.024
typically have a score of 32 or above.

00:54:08.024 --> 00:54:10.016
And what you can see is that
it grows up dramatically

00:54:10.016 --> 00:54:12.913
with the more types of
synaesthesia you have.

00:54:12.913 --> 00:54:14.253
There is a clear relationship

00:54:14.253 --> 00:54:16.777
between synaesthesia and
autism but it's complex

00:54:16.777 --> 00:54:20.262
and it's to do with the nature of

00:54:20.262 --> 00:54:22.845
how synaesthetic your brain is.

00:54:26.231 --> 00:54:28.551
To summarize, what I would say is that

00:54:28.551 --> 00:54:31.907
synaesthesia is linked
to certain abilities.

00:54:31.907 --> 00:54:34.987
It's linked to enhanced memory.

00:54:34.987 --> 00:54:37.757
It's also linked to some
of the traits of autism.

00:54:37.757 --> 00:54:39.618
It's linked to sensory sensitivity

00:54:39.618 --> 00:54:40.639
which I'm not sure whether that's

00:54:40.639 --> 00:54:42.038
a positive or negative trait.

00:54:42.038 --> 00:54:45.167
It's normally cast in
terms of a negative trait

00:54:45.167 --> 00:54:48.417
but whether or not that has particular,

00:54:49.490 --> 00:54:52.259
whether it is linked to
either abilities I don't know.

00:54:52.259 --> 00:54:54.423
Attention to detail is a clear ability

00:54:54.423 --> 00:54:57.543
that is probably driving some
of these savant abilities

00:54:57.543 --> 00:55:00.518
to notice patterns, to notice details

00:55:00.518 --> 00:55:02.435
in their sensory world.

00:55:03.371 --> 00:55:05.905
Although synaesthetes
don't necessarily present

00:55:05.905 --> 00:55:08.522
with the triad of impairments

00:55:08.522 --> 00:55:11.131
that classically define autism,

00:55:11.131 --> 00:55:14.412
what seems to happen is
that you have an increased

00:55:14.412 --> 00:55:16.421
vulnerability of getting that.

00:55:16.421 --> 00:55:20.588
In a way you buy in to having
the advantages of autism

00:55:21.610 --> 00:55:24.601
but the danger is that
you are more susceptible

00:55:24.601 --> 00:55:27.471
to getting the negative traits as well.

00:55:27.471 --> 00:55:29.129
It's almost as if
synaesthetes are occupying

00:55:29.129 --> 00:55:31.270
a very interesting cognitive niche

00:55:31.270 --> 00:55:34.097
where they're sliding up the
autistic scale a little bit

00:55:34.097 --> 00:55:35.519
and getting some of the benefits

00:55:35.519 --> 00:55:38.051
but they're not falling
over the cliff edge.

00:55:38.051 --> 00:55:40.286
But you stand a risk
of doing that of course

00:55:40.286 --> 00:55:44.286
just by moving up that
particular genetic niche.

00:55:45.954 --> 00:55:47.348
To conclude, synaesthesia is linked

00:55:47.348 --> 00:55:50.619
to basic difference in brain function.

00:55:50.619 --> 00:55:53.652
We don't fully understand
what those differences are

00:55:53.652 --> 00:55:56.831
but my best guess is that
it's to do with differences

00:55:56.831 --> 00:55:59.846
in plasticity, in holding
on particularly to

00:55:59.846 --> 00:56:02.351
sensory information over time.

00:56:02.351 --> 00:56:05.094
And also to sensory sensitivity

00:56:05.094 --> 00:56:07.189
both subjectively and probably again

00:56:07.189 --> 00:56:10.564
in terms of cognitive processing.

00:56:10.564 --> 00:56:13.203
Many of these traits seem to be shared

00:56:13.203 --> 00:56:16.143
with the positive features of autism.

00:56:16.143 --> 00:56:20.226
So abilities, savant's
characteristics and so on.

00:56:21.183 --> 00:56:24.482
Synaesthesia is linked to
cognitive enhancements in memory

00:56:24.482 --> 00:56:27.710
but again, it doesn't seem that
synaesthesia is just simply

00:56:27.710 --> 00:56:30.153
a mnemonic device or a cognitive tool.

00:56:30.153 --> 00:56:32.498
Some people do use their
synaesthesia in that way

00:56:32.498 --> 00:56:34.907
but it seems to be a deeper connection

00:56:34.907 --> 00:56:38.731
between synaesthesia and
cognitive enhancement.

00:56:38.731 --> 00:56:41.192
And I guess in terms of
a more general conclusion

00:56:41.192 --> 00:56:44.763
for this symposium is an
even medium-sized effect,

00:56:44.763 --> 00:56:46.774
so the fact that
synaesthetes are shifted up

00:56:46.774 --> 00:56:49.274
by a medium-sized effect means

00:56:50.452 --> 00:56:52.727
it has profound consequences at the tail

00:56:52.727 --> 00:56:55.582
that you really can
overrepresent things at the tail

00:56:55.582 --> 00:56:58.824
because of the way that these
normal distributions go.

00:56:58.824 --> 00:57:00.158
It might be that even though

00:57:00.158 --> 00:57:02.436
most synaesthetes aren't exceptional,

00:57:02.436 --> 00:57:04.434
actually there's something
about synaesthesia

00:57:04.434 --> 00:57:06.894
that is really kind of driving things

00:57:06.894 --> 00:57:11.582
at that high tail end in the
exceptional ability zone.

00:57:11.582 --> 00:57:12.697
Thank you very much for your time.

00:57:12.697 --> 00:57:13.883
These are my collaborators

00:57:13.883 --> 00:57:15.543
and these are some famous synaesthetes

00:57:15.543 --> 00:57:17.401
none of whom I've worked with.

00:57:17.401 --> 00:57:18.514
(audience laughs)

00:57:18.514 --> 00:57:21.514
(audience clapping)

00:57:23.835 --> 00:57:26.418
(upbeat music)
