00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:03.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:25.670
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: I'm Anne McLean
from the Library's Music Division.

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:28.840
We are very excited to be able
to present this special lecture

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:30.980
by Janet Eilber, Artistic Director

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:33.990
of the Martha Graham Center
for Contemporary Dance.

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:38.490 position:56%
The title is "Cave of the Heart,"
Noguchi's set for the Graham ballet.

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:41.780
It's an interesting and
unusual event for us and kind

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:44.270
of an informal gallery
talk centering

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:47.570
on Isamu Noguchi's
serpent and spider dress.

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:49.040
If you're coming to one

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:52.770 position:56%
of the Graham Company's performances
this week, and I hope you are,

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.330
you'll see the complete
set on stage.

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:58.270
And by the way, if you have a
program, please hang on to them

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:00.970
because they're going fast.

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:04.900
Tonight's lecture is one of four
events focusing on Isamu Noguchi

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.690
and our Martha Graham
at the Library festival.

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:09.960
They are made possible
through the generous support

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.140
of Dr. Sachiko Kuno
and Dr. Ryuji Ueno.

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:18.540 position:56%
The profound artistic connection and
lifelong friendship between Graham

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.120
and Noguchi is an important
programmatic thread running

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:25.930
through our ten day festival of
events in talks and film screenings

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:30.030
that explore a four
decade collaboration.

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.890
Without Isamu Noguchi I could have
done nothing, Graham commented,

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:38.240
saying that he was for her
almost like another dancer.

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.970
And she talked about the unspoken
language she shared with him,

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.450
a rich vocabulary of symbolism.

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.490
Everything he does means
something, she said.

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:52.880
Whatever he did in those sets,
he did as a Zen garden does it,

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:57.840
back to a fundamental
of life of ritual.

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.840
Janet Eilber has written about
the challenges of working

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.400
with these arresting, evocative
sculptural designs for dancers,

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:10.000
quote, an intimate and complicated
relationship with the sets.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.150
A dancer herself, she's performed
many of the roles originated

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.050
by Martha Graham, dancing,
for example,

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:18.850
the role of the pioneering woman in
"Appalachian Spring" on our stage

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:20.970
in the Coolidge Auditorium.

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.030
In other arenas she stared in
Bob Fosse's musical "Dancin,"

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.200 position:56%
and in the "American Dance Machine".

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.710
Her extensive work as
an actor includes stage,

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:32.460
film and television appearances,

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:36.550 position:56%
and she has received four Lester
Horton awards for her reconstruction

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:40.470
and performance of seminal
American modern dance.

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:45.290 position:56%
Since 2005 her brilliant curatorship
of the Graham legacy and her work

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.480
as artistic director of the company
has centered on creating new forms

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.060
of audience access to
the Graham masterworks.

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.290
In this endeavor she's opened
new avenues through technology

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:00.500
and media ventures, like a new app
for mobile phones and a presence

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.810
on the Google Cultural Institute,

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.130
as well as a substantial
commissioning program

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:08.630
from new works, which
we have benefited from.

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:10.880
I'd like to say that we
are very grateful to Janet,

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:13.890
who's a longtime friend of
the Library, for helping also

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:16.670
to bring the Martha Graham
collection here to the Library

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:19.690
of Congress, and especially
for her collaboration

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:22.040 position:56%
in developing this festival with us.

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.200
We are celebrating together
the 90th anniversary

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.390
of the Library's concert
series and the 90th anniversary

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:30.310
of the Martha Graham Dance Company.

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:33.010
So please join me in
welcoming Janet Eilber.

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:34.310
[ Applause ]

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:36.110
&gt;&gt; Janet Eilber: I just
need to squeak through.

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:41.350
[ Applause ]

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:44.210
&gt;&gt; Janet Eilber: Thank you.

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:45.510
Thank you.

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:46.810
And thank you, Anne.

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:51.220
We are so excited about this
festival and especially, of course,

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:53.750
about the commission that I
hope you're all coming to see

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:56.390
at the world-premiere on
Friday and Saturday night

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:00.240
and the many different ways of
looking at the Graham legacy.

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:05.100
It's all a wonderful highlight
of our 90th anniversary season.

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:07.650
Once in a while we say
it's 90 the hard way,

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:10.390
but we're feeling really
good about it.

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:12.670
And we want to say a big
thank you to the Library

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:13.970
for this special festival.

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:15.600
It's really wonderful.

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:20.530
So tonight we're going to focus
on this wonderful collaboration

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:24.390
between Martha Graham and
Isamu Noguchi, and especially

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:27.780
on one particular work,
"Cave of the Heart".

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:32.060
I'm here to speak from the Graham
side of the aisle because I danced

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:36.870
"Cave of the Heart" for many
years as the chorus and it was one

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:38.850
of my very favorite roles.

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:42.120
Tonight I want to begin
to look at talking

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:45.580
about their common
aesthetic, the commonality

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:49.940
between these two artists and the
evolution of their discoveries,

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:53.050
their innovations for the stage
leading up to "Cave of the Heart"

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:58.330
so we can all better appreciate
what all is poured into this work

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:04.650
that they arrived at in 1946, and
then I hope we'll have some time

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:08.500
for questions and perhaps
a social media moment.

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:11.180
We'll hope you'll take some
pictures of the set and Tweet them

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:14.070
or Instagram them, or
whatever you want to do.

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:18.300
So Martha and Noguchi had a
partnership, as Anne said,

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:23.560
that lasted for decades, created
over 20 unique works for the stage.

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:26.990
And though they were working
in different art forms,

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:32.560 position:56%
they were both searching for the
elemental shape, whether in movement

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:36.400
or in sculpture, that would
provide the viewer with what they

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:39.020
like to say the shock
of recognition,

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:43.000
a phrase that they borrowed from
their friend Buckminster Fuller.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:49.340
Noguchi said I wanted
something that was irreducible.

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:55.280
And Martha often said I
was after the thing itself.

00:05:55.280 --> 00:06:00.320
For Martha that involved creating
a revolutionary new type of dancing

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:05.580
that was borne out of natural
gesture, out of body language,

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:08.890
and while she was doing this,
Noguchi was experimenting

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:12.560
with the same idea,
the power of organic,

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:16.080
primal shapes in his sculptures.

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:19.820
Martha said she was attracted to
Noguchi's ideas because, quote,

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:23.480
He had the astringency that
everything was stripped

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:26.580
to essentials, rather
than being decorative.

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:28.460
Everything he does means something.

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:32.430
It is not abstract, except
if you think of orange juice

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:35.290
as the abstraction of an orange.

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:38.200
And that pretty much
describes her own aesthetics

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:43.950
to a T. I can't tell you how many
times in rehearsal she would stop

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:49.590
and rail against some lovely
new interpretation we had added

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:53.040 position:56%
by saying it was frankly decorative.

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:56.300
That was the ultimate insult.

00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:01.910
Their first work for the
stage came about in 1935.

00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:06.320
I'm going to see if I
know how to do this now.

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:11.310
Yes. Earlier in her career Martha
had rejected the traditional stage

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:14.630
dÃ©cor, which was usually
a painted backdrop.

00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:18.120
She considered it to be
distracting and decorative.

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:22.070
And she danced on a bare
stage needing nothing else.

00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:26.550
But as her work matured
she wanted the audience

00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:31.750
to have more information and she
wanted a sense of place, location

00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:36.670
and atmosphere, so she turned
to her friend Isamu Noguchi.

00:07:36.670 --> 00:07:43.120 position:56%
He had created a bust of her several
years earlier, which she hated,

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:48.640
and she insisted that he create
another, but they remained friends.

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:52.400
And he created this set for
the solo she was working

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:54.700
on titled "Frontier."

00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:58.680
Noguchi later wrote about this set.

00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:01.480
"Frontier" was my first set.

00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:05.530
It was, for me, the genesis of
an idea to wed the total void

00:08:05.530 --> 00:08:09.170
of theater space to form an action.

00:08:09.170 --> 00:08:12.470
A rope running from the two
top corners of the proscenium

00:08:12.470 --> 00:08:14.990
to the floor rear center
of the stage,

00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:19.320
bisected the three
dimensional void of stage space.

00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:22.330
This seemed to throw the
entire volume of air straight

00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:24.900
out over the heads of the audience.

00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:28.690
At the rear convergence there
was a small section of log fence

00:08:28.690 --> 00:08:31.440
to start from and return to.

00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:37.130 position:56%
The white ropes created a curious
ennobling of an outburst into space,

00:08:37.130 --> 00:08:42.730
and at the same time, of the
public's inrush towards infinity.

00:08:42.730 --> 00:08:46.310
Martha had suggested to him
that she wanted something

00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:48.050
like the railroad tracks.

00:08:48.050 --> 00:08:50.790
Her family traveled
across country quite often,

00:08:50.790 --> 00:08:54.260
and that idea of perspective.

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:57.810
Noguchi finished, This set
was the point of departure

00:08:57.810 --> 00:09:00.780
for all my subsequent theater work.

00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:05.780
Space became a volume to
be dealt with sculpturally.

00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:09.000
Prior to "Frontier" in 1935 --

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.950
there's one with Martha
next to the set --

00:09:11.950 --> 00:09:15.210
Martha had already been
experimenting with this idea

00:09:15.210 --> 00:09:19.850
of the power of manipulating
the empty space on stage

00:09:19.850 --> 00:09:23.530
with her choreography for
large groups of women.

00:09:23.530 --> 00:09:32.440
"Heretic," from 1929, is a prime
example of Martha's use of space

00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:36.230
to support her emotional
theme, with its wall of women

00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:39.700
in black constantly shifting
and blocking the path,

00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:43.280
blocking the freedom of
the lone figure in white.

00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:48.960
It was a modernist, geometric
evocation of oppression.

00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:52.360
In her classics "Primitive
Mysteries" from 1931,

00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:56.600
"Celebration" from '34,
and "Panorama" from 1935,

00:09:56.600 --> 00:10:02.100 position:56%
which had a cast of 33 dancers,
Martha was mining the space on stage

00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:06.610
with her geometric patterns,
the counterpoint of these groups

00:10:06.610 --> 00:10:12.610
of women, to create pathways,
tableaus, lines of force

00:10:12.610 --> 00:10:14.300
and different levels

00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:18.600
to most powerfully send her
message, her emotional message.

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:22.580
In fact, "Panorama" used
ramps and staircases on stage,

00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:26.510
as well as an overhead
mobile by Alexander Calder.

00:10:26.510 --> 00:10:30.620
So she was primed with these ideas
when she and Noguchi connected,

00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:38.120
and the two of them continued to
innovate and develop this idea.

00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:42.140
You'll see "Appalachian Spring"
in our programs this weekend,

00:10:42.140 --> 00:10:45.010
and I'm going to show
you a little bit of it.

00:10:45.010 --> 00:10:52.690
The stage here at the Library
is concise, so we do --

00:10:52.690 --> 00:10:58.530
part of the set is kind of through
the door in the back of the stage,

00:10:58.530 --> 00:11:00.770
but that's the way
Martha must have done it

00:11:00.770 --> 00:11:04.880
in the very first performance,
but I want to show you a film

00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:09.590
that shows you the entire set and
you'll see that it's an extension

00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:13.490
of the discoveries Noguchi
talked about in "Frontier".

00:11:13.490 --> 00:11:19.400 position:56%
The beams of this house, this
outline of a house that is on stage,

00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:23.090
have that same idea of
perspective built into them

00:11:23.090 --> 00:11:27.170
so that space is pushed out
over the audience's head,

00:11:27.170 --> 00:11:29.840
and at the same time inviting them

00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:34.300
in to this new home
nestled in the prairie.

00:11:34.300 --> 00:11:36.300
Let me see if I can manage this.

00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:39.310
Come on. There it is.

00:11:39.310 --> 00:11:42.810
This is kind of a side
view at the moment.

00:11:42.810 --> 00:11:50.440
The camera's going to come around

00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:54.510
and give you the front
and center view.

00:11:54.510 --> 00:12:30.040
[ Music ]

00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:32.420
You might have caught a
bit of it in that clip,

00:12:32.420 --> 00:12:35.680
but you'll definitely see
it in performance this week,

00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:40.980
that the dancers are also
required to inhabit this new space

00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:43.740
that Noguchi has created.

00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:48.600
So as they enter, and in many
places throughout the ballet,

00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:53.980
they gesture out across the
limitless space, the frontier,

00:12:53.980 --> 00:12:57.690
the future, they gaze
out in that direction.

00:12:57.690 --> 00:13:02.320
The pioneering woman is often
making sure that there's no trouble

00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:05.870
out there, out on the prairie.

00:13:05.870 --> 00:13:10.720
So it's quite a revolutionary
aspect of what Graham

00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:13.230
and Noguchi put together.

00:13:13.230 --> 00:13:17.720
Now, they no sooner had sort of
conquered this idea of extending

00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:21.750
and changing the space on stage,
but they began to understand

00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:26.820
that they could also evoke inner
space, the psychological space.

00:13:26.820 --> 00:13:30.000
As Martha liked to call
it, the inner landscape.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.960
And while she began
choreographing the mind,

00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:39.620
Noguchi was using organic shape
to also evoke the interior.

00:13:39.620 --> 00:13:44.580 position:56%
The same evening as they premiered
"Appalachian Spring" at the Library,

00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:48.750
they premiered "Herodiade,"
with a score by Paul Hindemith,

00:13:48.750 --> 00:13:50.580 position:56%
another commission from the Library.

00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:52.930
It's kind of a mysterious dance,

00:13:52.930 --> 00:13:55.120
even to those of us
who have danced it.

00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:57.320
There's no exact narrative.

00:13:57.320 --> 00:14:01.930
This may be a woman choosing
between life and death,

00:14:01.930 --> 00:14:05.850
it may be a recurring
theme in Graham's work,

00:14:05.850 --> 00:14:09.930
the dilemma of the creative artist
fighting against repression,

00:14:09.930 --> 00:14:14.920
but it's definitely an
internal battle made visible.

00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:19.880
Noguchi said about his set that
"Herodiade" was the most Baroque

00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:23.820
and specifically sculptural
of my sets.

00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:28.580
Within a woman's private world
and intimate space I was asked

00:14:28.580 --> 00:14:33.080
to place a mirror, a
chair and a clothes rack.

00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:35.280
Salome dances before her mirror.

00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:36.720
What does she see?

00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:40.790
Her bones, the potential
skeleton of her body.

00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:44.670
The chair is like an extension of
her vertebrae; the clothes rack,

00:14:44.670 --> 00:14:48.660
the circumscribed bones
on which is hung her skin.

00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:53.750
This is the desecration of
beauty, the consciousness of time.

00:14:53.750 --> 00:14:56.580
So the mirror is on
the left side there,

00:14:56.580 --> 00:15:00.890
with the swinging moon-shaped
articles,

00:15:00.890 --> 00:15:08.030
and Martha in her solos would
advance to it and back away,

00:15:08.030 --> 00:15:10.280
really aiming for the bird.

00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:14.260
She used to talk about the bird
in the center of the mirror

00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:18.610
that was the animating
life that she could dance

00:15:18.610 --> 00:15:23.060
to in the middle of this.

00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:28.860
So following "Appalachian Spring"
and "Herodiade" in 1944 Graham

00:15:28.860 --> 00:15:33.380
and Noguchi did three works
that I consider to be some

00:15:33.380 --> 00:15:36.760
of their greatest, all
based on Greek myth.

00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:41.550
They both were this was a common
to both of them, very interested

00:15:41.550 --> 00:15:44.970
in myth and legend,
and to the archaic,

00:15:44.970 --> 00:15:47.810
archaic art of ancient cultures.

00:15:47.810 --> 00:15:53.920
I think they understood that these
ancient stories were elemental

00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:58.690 position:56%
to the human condition and very much
aligned with what they were trying

00:15:58.690 --> 00:16:01.500
to do in their modernist form.

00:16:01.500 --> 00:16:04.840
These three works;
"Errand into the Maze,"

00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:07.960
"Cave of the Heart"
and "Night Journey".

00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:16.080
Using the classics as inspiration
also gave Martha another advantage.

00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:20.370
Again, the audience would
arrive with pre knowledge.

00:16:20.370 --> 00:16:22.980
They knew the characters
and she didn't have

00:16:22.980 --> 00:16:24.660
to spend any time introducing them.

00:16:24.660 --> 00:16:28.020 position:56%
She could dive right into the drama.

00:16:28.020 --> 00:16:33.200
And so not satisfied with just
manipulating space on stage,

00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:37.450
Martha was now also beginning
to rearrange time on stage,

00:16:37.450 --> 00:16:42.320 position:56%
choreographing memories,
flashbacks, stream of consciousness.

00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:46.810
"Night Journey" from 1947
is probably the best example

00:16:46.810 --> 00:16:48.290
of this technique.

00:16:48.290 --> 00:16:51.470
It's Martha's version
of the Oedipus story,

00:16:51.470 --> 00:16:55.430
and it begins as Sophocles'
play ends,

00:16:55.430 --> 00:16:59.190
with Jocasta having discovered
the truth and the curtain goes

00:16:59.190 --> 00:17:04.370
up with her holding the rope over
her head and about to end her life.

00:17:04.370 --> 00:17:09.560
The ballet takes place, it's
about a 30 minute ballet,

00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:12.520
as if her life flashes
before her eyes

00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:14.810
in the seconds before
she does herself in.

00:17:14.810 --> 00:17:18.140
She remembers Oedipus and
she remembers their marriage

00:17:18.140 --> 00:17:20.860
and discovering the
truth, and the ballet ends

00:17:20.860 --> 00:17:25.280
with her tightening the rope around
her neck and doing herself in.

00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:28.110
For this dance, this
story of incest --

00:17:28.110 --> 00:17:31.110
I'm going to have to shoot through.

00:17:31.110 --> 00:17:33.850
Sorry, you're going to see
"Errand into the Maze".

00:17:33.850 --> 00:17:39.910
Noguchi created a bed, but it's
more than a bed, of course.

00:17:39.910 --> 00:17:43.390
He said, I created a bed
as the central sculpture,

00:17:43.390 --> 00:17:46.970
a double image of male and female.

00:17:46.970 --> 00:17:51.100
So you can see the left side
of the bed is the phallic side,

00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:53.010
the male side, and the right side

00:17:53.010 --> 00:17:57.920
of the bed has the organic
breasts, if you will.

00:17:57.920 --> 00:18:05.740
So his organic shapes, it was as
Noguchi could be so practical,

00:18:05.740 --> 00:18:10.370
it was a bed and a story
about incest, but it just has

00:18:10.370 --> 00:18:16.280
so many more meanings
in its beautiful shape.

00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:22.570 position:56%
I want to detour just a little while
we're talking about organic shape,

00:18:22.570 --> 00:18:27.750
to talk a little bit more
about Martha's interest in this

00:18:27.750 --> 00:18:30.800
because one could say, well,
you've got a body on the stage,

00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:33.060
that's an organic shape, right.

00:18:33.060 --> 00:18:40.060
But really, Martha's technique is a
little more complicated than that.

00:18:40.060 --> 00:18:45.610
In the 1920s she was dissatisfied
with dance of the day, which was,

00:18:45.610 --> 00:18:50.380 position:56%
frankly, decorative, escapist, gods
and goddesses from imaginary places,

00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:53.690
kings and queens, swans and
flowers, and that sort of thing,

00:18:53.690 --> 00:18:55.790
and she really wanted to dance

00:18:55.790 --> 00:18:59.710
about real human emotions
and the human condition.

00:18:59.710 --> 00:19:06.690
And she started experimenting
with and studying body language,

00:19:06.690 --> 00:19:12.760
how we hold ourselves when we are
under stress or when we're in love

00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:19.660 position:56%
or when we laugh or when we cry,
and she discovered her new approach.

00:19:19.660 --> 00:19:23.650 position:56%
One of the things she discovered was
that emotion rides on the breath.

00:19:23.650 --> 00:19:26.300
When you're nervous,
oh, it's on your breath.

00:19:26.300 --> 00:19:28.700
When you sob, when you
laugh, it's all coming

00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:30.930
from the center of your torso.

00:19:30.930 --> 00:19:36.300
And through that idea she developed
her famous contraction and release;

00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:41.760
the contraction being the coiling
in, the folding of the torso,

00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:46.090
[demonstrating], the exhale, and
the release being the inhale,

00:19:46.090 --> 00:19:47.390
[demonstrating], and the expansion

00:19:47.390 --> 00:19:50.710
that sends energy throughout
the whole body.

00:19:50.710 --> 00:19:57.160
I'm going to put on a video
and I'm going to keep talking.

00:19:57.160 --> 00:20:01.950
This is an excerpt from a
Martha Graham classroom,

00:20:01.950 --> 00:20:07.640
from a technique class, and in a
Graham technique class we spend

00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:11.290
about the first 30 minutes of
a 90 minute class on the floor,

00:20:11.290 --> 00:20:16.570
sitting on the floor, so that you
articulate and strengthen the torso

00:20:16.570 --> 00:20:19.330
without the legs getting involved.

00:20:19.330 --> 00:20:24.300
Of course, they are involved, but
and so you'll see in this exercise,

00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:25.650
which probably the one you're

00:20:25.650 --> 00:20:28.910
about to see would happen
20 minutes into a class.

00:20:28.910 --> 00:20:32.480
We've gone through the basic
contractions and releases.

00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:39.060
Okay. It's going to
come up, isn't it?

00:20:40.610 --> 00:20:41.910
Give it a minute.

00:20:41.910 --> 00:20:44.350
There we go.

00:20:44.350 --> 00:20:46.460
And this one's a little
more complicated.

00:20:46.460 --> 00:20:53.100
You'll see the torso
is not only contracting

00:20:53.100 --> 00:20:55.330
and releasing, but it's spiraling.

00:20:55.330 --> 00:20:58.810
The legs are leveraging
against the floor.

00:21:03.190 --> 00:21:09.150
And she began to understand, as
she developed this technique --

00:21:09.150 --> 00:21:11.910
and she developed it
on stage, really.

00:21:11.910 --> 00:21:15.040
She had a vision for what
she wanted on the stage,

00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:18.410
and then began excerpting the
movement that she was putting

00:21:18.410 --> 00:21:22.770
on the stage into the classroom
so that she could study it

00:21:22.770 --> 00:21:24.680
and teach it to other dancers.

00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:27.880
So it's a very dramatic
emotional technique.

00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:33.210 position:56%
And she began to understand how
intimate and emotional, even erotic,

00:21:33.210 --> 00:21:37.260
movement driven by the
torso and the pelvis can be.

00:21:37.260 --> 00:21:41.790
And at the same time she saw how
much physical power is generated

00:21:41.790 --> 00:21:46.290
by using the core muscles, the
weight of the body leveraging

00:21:46.290 --> 00:21:50.270
against the earth, rather
than the antigravity goals

00:21:50.270 --> 00:21:51.600
of classical ballet.

00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:52.900
Quite the opposite.

00:21:52.900 --> 00:21:57.160
She wanted both the power
and the message of effort.

00:21:57.160 --> 00:22:05.420
These are called pleading
contractions,

00:22:05.420 --> 00:22:09.270
and we're encouraged
to think of the Pieta.

00:22:09.270 --> 00:22:14.540
We're showing the vulnerability
of the inner wrist and the side

00:22:14.540 --> 00:22:16.970
of the neck exposing the jugular.

00:22:25.230 --> 00:22:27.530
Release.

00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:45.780
Big contraction.

00:22:45.780 --> 00:22:51.370
So on our programs this
weekend all of the Graham works

00:22:51.370 --> 00:22:55.790
on these programs will
be using this vocabulary

00:22:55.790 --> 00:22:59.800
that is entirely driven
by the torso.

00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:05.030
It's not always a very obvious
big contraction and release.

00:23:05.030 --> 00:23:09.480
Sometimes it's a simple shift
of the back that makes us walk.

00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:13.380
There's no such thing as just
sort of a casual Graham walk.

00:23:13.380 --> 00:23:18.830 position:56%
It's the weight of the body
shifting before the foot catches it.

00:23:18.830 --> 00:23:23.850
In Medea's dance of vengeance,
her second solo, she begins --

00:23:23.850 --> 00:23:27.430
you'll think she's just standing
stock still and then you'll begin

00:23:27.430 --> 00:23:33.530
to see her dress vibrate and her
whole body is shaking with fury.

00:23:33.530 --> 00:23:38.120
These are all little contractions,
stuff coming from the center

00:23:38.120 --> 00:23:44.260
of her body to denote
these emotional things.

00:23:44.260 --> 00:23:50.820
They're going to do a
little bit more for us.

00:23:52.310 --> 00:23:54.460
There's a beautiful contraction.

00:23:54.460 --> 00:23:58.600
They're going to go
into a full another move

00:23:58.600 --> 00:24:05.380
from Medea is what we call the knee
vibrations, where her insides are

00:24:05.380 --> 00:24:12.500 position:56%
so stirred up that it gets the leg
involved, but again, it's all coming

00:24:12.500 --> 00:24:17.950
from the torso, contracting
and releasing, and the turmoil

00:24:17.950 --> 00:24:23.920
in the what she's going through
shows throughout her whole body.

00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:25.230
All right.

00:24:25.230 --> 00:24:27.970
I'll let them keep going for a
minute, but I want to now talk

00:24:27.970 --> 00:24:32.460
about the specifics, specifics
of "Cave of the Heart".

00:24:32.460 --> 00:24:37.370
Martha was so eager to
choreograph this story.

00:24:37.370 --> 00:24:44.270
In 1941 she wrote a script
titled "Daughter of Colchis,"

00:24:44.270 --> 00:24:47.400
about the dance drama she
envisioned, and she wrote,

00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:51.810
about Medea, To me, she
is a barbarian princess.

00:24:51.810 --> 00:24:55.950
She possesses the animality
of the undisciplined being.

00:24:55.950 --> 00:25:00.150
It is bitter, sardonic,
murderess, despairing.

00:25:00.150 --> 00:25:03.280
Someplace I read that it might
be any wife to any husband.

00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:07.280
I ought to know about that.

00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:12.730
She intended to do Medea as the
first commission with the Library

00:25:12.730 --> 00:25:18.090 position:56%
of Congress, and she sent that
script to Aaron Copland who declined

00:25:18.090 --> 00:25:24.760 position:56%
and suggested it might be nice, as
he said, to be a little less severe,

00:25:24.760 --> 00:25:28.510
maybe a combination of "Our Town"
and the script that you sent me.

00:25:28.510 --> 00:25:31.320

00:25:31.320 --> 00:25:36.720
So in 1942 she sent the
script to Carlos Chavez,

00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:40.410
but the score that Chavez sent her
did not have what she called the

00:25:40.410 --> 00:25:44.350
secret violence that she
had described in the script

00:25:44.350 --> 00:25:47.640
and she decided the score
was without stage awareness,

00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:50.560
so she didn't use it
until a few years later,

00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:54.150
when she created a gorgeous ballet,

00:25:54.150 --> 00:25:57.240
"Dark Meadow," from
the Chavez score.

00:25:57.240 --> 00:25:59.640
Very ritualistic.

00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:03.190
It's known as her Jungian ballet.

00:26:03.190 --> 00:26:06.540
And we are doing highlights
from "Dark Meadow"

00:26:06.540 --> 00:26:08.520
on our program this weekend.

00:26:08.520 --> 00:26:14.820
So finally, in 1945, now we're four
years later, she sent the script

00:26:14.820 --> 00:26:19.080
to Samuel Barber who created the
score that you'll hear with "Cave

00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:24.330
of the Heart" today, and which
has become a well known standard

00:26:24.330 --> 00:26:27.380
orchestral work in the
American concert repertoire.

00:26:27.380 --> 00:26:30.920
So "Cave of the Heart"
premiered in 1946.

00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:37.240
Martha, of course, stripped the
Greek tragedy down to its essences,

00:26:37.240 --> 00:26:41.710
and Noguchi matched her
with the abstract set pieces

00:26:41.710 --> 00:26:45.840
that evoke both story
elements as well as some

00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:48.230
of the most basic human emotions.

00:26:48.230 --> 00:26:52.840
The action in "Cave of the Heart"
is carried by four players only;

00:26:52.840 --> 00:26:57.770
the sorceress Medea, who has
been rejected by her lover;

00:26:57.770 --> 00:27:01.360
the ambitious Jason,
who's overthrown Medea

00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:06.200
to make a political marriage to the
princess; the innocent princess,

00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:11.460
Jason's new bride; and the
all-knowing but powerless Chorus,

00:27:11.460 --> 00:27:17.190
who warns the audience that a
tale of horror is about to unfold.

00:27:17.190 --> 00:27:20.960
Now, about the set.

00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:24.450
It's both a landscape
and an inner landscape.

00:27:24.450 --> 00:27:27.190
Noguchi said, I constructed
a landscape

00:27:27.190 --> 00:27:29.470
like the islands of Greece.

00:27:29.470 --> 00:27:33.260
On the horizon, center
rear, lies a volcanic shape

00:27:33.260 --> 00:27:36.660
like a black aorta, like a heart.

00:27:36.660 --> 00:27:39.880 position:56%
To this leads steppingstone islands.

00:27:39.880 --> 00:27:44.080
This references Jason's
voyage and the Golden Fleece.

00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:46.710
Opposite is coiled a green serpent

00:27:46.710 --> 00:27:51.220
on whose back rests the
transformational dress of gold.

00:27:52.990 --> 00:27:59.290
So these five smaller rocks are the
Greek Islands, the stepping stones.

00:27:59.290 --> 00:28:00.990
Of course, they're in a
different place on the stage.

00:28:00.990 --> 00:28:03.680
I think one of my video clips
will show you how they're set

00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:05.300
up on stage.

00:28:05.300 --> 00:28:11.160
And this is the serpent,
Medea's sort of home base,

00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:14.290
with the transformational
dress on top.

00:28:14.290 --> 00:28:17.410
Martha said, When I needed
a place for Medea on stage,

00:28:17.410 --> 00:28:22.080
the heart of her being,
Isamu brought me a snake.

00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:25.210
And Noguchi said, Martha
didn't ask me to make a snake.

00:28:25.210 --> 00:28:27.640
These are objects that
I make that derive

00:28:27.640 --> 00:28:30.850
from a depiction of
an emotional state.

00:28:30.850 --> 00:28:33.350
So as Martha choreographed
she integrated this set

00:28:33.350 --> 00:28:34.870
into the choreography.

00:28:34.870 --> 00:28:37.350
Noguchi's design, of
course, gave her pathways

00:28:37.350 --> 00:28:40.480
and gave her different
levels and places to hide.

00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:42.430
Each character has a home base.

00:28:42.430 --> 00:28:46.590
We have Medea's here with us, and
you'll see when she's on stage,

00:28:46.590 --> 00:28:51.170
you're viewing it from the
front and she is so low inside,

00:28:51.170 --> 00:28:54.920
it's almost like there's a
lower level to the stage.

00:28:54.920 --> 00:28:56.930
It's almost as if she's
below the area.

00:28:56.930 --> 00:29:00.740
And she's hiding things
behind the serpent that appear

00:29:00.740 --> 00:29:03.420
in the course of the dance.

00:29:03.420 --> 00:29:08.330
The chorus, her home base
is the heart, the aorta,

00:29:08.330 --> 00:29:11.300
which is not on display,
you'll see in one of the clips.

00:29:11.300 --> 00:29:14.620
And the dancers call it the
elephant because it looks

00:29:14.620 --> 00:29:16.260
like an elephant lying on its back

00:29:16.260 --> 00:29:19.280
with four feet sticking
up in the air.

00:29:19.280 --> 00:29:29.350 position:56%
And the great creativity in how
Martha has designed the choreography

00:29:29.350 --> 00:29:31.470
for the chorus and for
the other characters

00:29:31.470 --> 00:29:35.180
to use the different
levels and the ins and outs

00:29:35.180 --> 00:29:38.310
of the elephant is quite wonderful.

00:29:38.310 --> 00:29:40.540
Who else. Jason.

00:29:40.540 --> 00:29:43.660
Jason's home base is really
the five Greek Islands

00:29:43.660 --> 00:29:47.250
that he strides across on occasion.

00:29:47.250 --> 00:29:54.470
At the pinnacle of his male
chauvinistic arrogance he takes the

00:29:54.470 --> 00:29:59.110
princess up onto the heart center
stage and puts her on one corner

00:29:59.110 --> 00:30:04.280 position:56%
and straddles two other corners as
absolute the highest point on stage,

00:30:04.280 --> 00:30:10.770
which Martha has used specifically
this high and mighty position

00:30:10.770 --> 00:30:16.470
to prime us all for the great
fall that is about to happen.

00:30:16.470 --> 00:30:18.420
The princess' home base is Jason,

00:30:18.420 --> 00:30:21.040
and you'll see why
when you see the show.

00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:23.240
They're very complicated lifts.

00:30:23.240 --> 00:30:24.540
They're kind of joined at the hip.

00:30:24.540 --> 00:30:27.590
She's either on his shoulder or
on his hip or walking up his thigh

00:30:27.590 --> 00:30:29.530
or stretched across his lap or --

00:30:29.530 --> 00:30:34.840
you know, home base
is Jason for her.

00:30:34.840 --> 00:30:41.320
As for how Martha used time in
"Cave of the Heart," she starts

00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:43.280
in the middle of the story.

00:30:43.280 --> 00:30:47.020 position:56%
The princess is already there, Jason
has already made the announcement

00:30:47.020 --> 00:30:50.290
that -- you know, and Medea's
world is already upside down.

00:30:50.290 --> 00:30:52.060
So we start right in
the middle of things.

00:30:52.060 --> 00:30:55.810
And it marches fairly
chronologically.

00:30:55.810 --> 00:30:59.880 position:56%
Not so much to like "Night Journey,"
which is memories and going back

00:30:59.880 --> 00:31:04.500
and forth, but what she
does do is she freezes time

00:31:04.500 --> 00:31:06.350
in "Cave of the Heart".

00:31:06.350 --> 00:31:07.840
Three of the characters will go

00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:11.590
into a tableau while
another one comes forward

00:31:11.590 --> 00:31:15.360
and we see his or her
inner monologue.

00:31:15.360 --> 00:31:18.580
It's very kind of cinematic,
I'm ready for my close-up,

00:31:18.580 --> 00:31:22.440
they come forward, and
then the group dances again

00:31:22.440 --> 00:31:25.750
and then the princess
and Jason come forward.

00:31:25.750 --> 00:31:34.030
They each have a moment to
let you into their secrets.

00:31:34.030 --> 00:31:40.630 position:56%
Also, she uses the same technique
in "Appalachian Spring," by the way.

00:31:40.630 --> 00:31:42.790 position:56%
You'll see time freeze, the tableaus

00:31:42.790 --> 00:31:47.160
that the dancers make while we
hear the inner workings of one

00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:49.300
or another of the characters.

00:31:49.300 --> 00:31:53.130
So I want to show you a
video of Jason and look

00:31:53.130 --> 00:31:56.640
at the movement motifs for
each one of these characters.

00:31:56.640 --> 00:32:01.950
You'll see that they
are very archaic,

00:32:01.950 --> 00:32:04.120
almost like coming off
the side of a Greek vase,

00:32:04.120 --> 00:32:06.980
particularly the three
other than Medea.

00:32:06.980 --> 00:32:09.360
Of course, Medea was Martha's role.

00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:12.620
Here's Jason.

00:32:12.620 --> 00:32:19.850
Very two-dimensional.

00:32:19.850 --> 00:32:22.510
You can see how the
islands [inaudible].

00:32:22.510 --> 00:32:39.230
[ Music ]

00:32:39.230 --> 00:32:42.040
Yeah. You almost got to see
the aorta in the background.

00:32:42.040 --> 00:32:45.380
Next I'm just going to
show you the princess.

00:32:45.380 --> 00:32:50.970
You can see how two-dimensional
she is, too.

00:33:01.280 --> 00:33:03.580
I hope.

00:33:09.050 --> 00:33:12.360
No. It's the wrong one.

00:33:12.360 --> 00:33:14.970
You'll get to see that, I promise.

00:33:23.060 --> 00:33:24.860
Here she is.

00:33:24.860 --> 00:34:02.070
[ Music ]

00:34:02.070 --> 00:34:06.160
So she's very frontal, keeping
her shoulders to the audience,

00:34:06.160 --> 00:34:09.670
doing all these little
doll-like gestures,

00:34:09.670 --> 00:34:12.270
like a little paper doll, really.

00:34:12.270 --> 00:34:17.220
And finally, the chorus, if
I'm in the right place now.

00:34:17.220 --> 00:34:21.510
This is, in particular, a moment
where she's like a [inaudible].

00:34:21.510 --> 00:34:41.580
[ Music ]

00:34:41.580 --> 00:34:44.150
Something else to look for in the
role of chorus, which is, I think,

00:34:44.150 --> 00:34:46.900 position:56%
why it was one of my favorite roles,

00:34:46.900 --> 00:34:51.820
for the chorus alone
the fourth wall is down.

00:34:51.820 --> 00:34:54.080
She's talking to the audience.

00:34:54.080 --> 00:34:56.550
The other characters are
interacting, you know,

00:34:56.550 --> 00:35:00.990
they're creating something
for Medea to fight against

00:35:00.990 --> 00:35:03.460
and move the story along.

00:35:03.460 --> 00:35:07.480
But from the very first gesture
of the chorus Martha told me

00:35:07.480 --> 00:35:12.590
in Greek theater someone would come
out and bang a staff on the floor

00:35:12.590 --> 00:35:15.950
and say a tale of horror
is about to unfold,

00:35:15.950 --> 00:35:18.320
if you can't take it,
you should leave now.

00:35:18.320 --> 00:35:21.730
And that's the role
of this character.

00:35:21.730 --> 00:35:26.520
She empathizes with Medea, but
she knows what's going to happen

00:35:26.520 --> 00:35:30.740
and she is constantly moving
forward to the audience sort

00:35:30.740 --> 00:35:34.910
of saying you should
leave, you should leave.

00:35:36.470 --> 00:35:42.350
And, of course, that costume is so
beautifully graphically designed.

00:35:42.350 --> 00:35:43.650
All right.

00:35:43.650 --> 00:35:44.950
Let's talk about Medea.

00:35:44.950 --> 00:35:48.820
It's Martha's role, of course,
so it's much more flesh and blood

00:35:48.820 --> 00:35:53.760
than it is archaic; although you'll
see it does have some stylization

00:35:53.760 --> 00:35:59.260
that is within the
vocabulary of the work.

00:35:59.260 --> 00:36:02.300
It's her journey, Medea's journey
in the course of the ballet,

00:36:02.300 --> 00:36:04.750
so in spite of being
a vengeful murderess,

00:36:04.750 --> 00:36:07.860
she's the protagonist of this work.

00:36:07.860 --> 00:36:09.800
She has two remarkable solos.

00:36:09.800 --> 00:36:12.180
The first one is a lament.

00:36:12.180 --> 00:36:14.920
She's trying to win Jason back.

00:36:14.920 --> 00:36:17.760
She does gestures,
you know, trying to --

00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:21.050
perhaps considering she's
not beautiful anymore.

00:36:21.050 --> 00:36:27.310
And this is a solo that
contains a series of upside

00:36:27.310 --> 00:36:33.170 position:56%
down arabesque turns, that I'm going
to show you, that are known now

00:36:33.170 --> 00:36:38.190
as the Cave turns because Martha
invented them for this ballet.

00:36:38.190 --> 00:36:42.850
She throws her torso over, the
leg comes up, she turns around.

00:36:42.850 --> 00:36:49.640
It's a cry, a wail, and
at the same time shows you

00:36:49.640 --> 00:36:52.650
that her world is absolutely
upside down.

00:36:52.650 --> 00:36:55.910
So here's a little bit,
I hope, of that one.

00:37:00.510 --> 00:38:07.080
[ Music ]

00:38:07.080 --> 00:38:13.400 position:56%
And there you got a good shot of
the aorta up there in the back, too.

00:38:13.400 --> 00:38:16.040
The second solo is
Medea's dance of vengeance,

00:38:16.040 --> 00:38:19.520
probably the best known part
of the music of this score.

00:38:19.520 --> 00:38:25.660
It contains a well known moment
where she pulls a long red ribbon

00:38:25.660 --> 00:38:34.040
out of her costume and devours it,
spews it out, rolls around in it.

00:38:34.040 --> 00:38:38.460
Noguchi said she's dancing
with the snake in her mouth

00:38:38.460 --> 00:38:41.860
and then she spews it out
of her mouth like blood.

00:38:41.860 --> 00:38:48.190
Martha used to say that it was her
own venom that she was dancing in.

00:38:48.190 --> 00:38:54.390
And it's an extraordinary solo that
I'm not going to show you any of.

00:38:54.390 --> 00:38:56.630
You have to come see it.

00:38:56.630 --> 00:38:59.840
But I am going to give you
a sneak preview of the use

00:38:59.840 --> 00:39:05.830 position:56%
of the brass dress of thorns because
it sits glittering evilly on stage

00:39:05.830 --> 00:39:09.810
for the entire ballet, and for
anyone who hasn't seen before,

00:39:09.810 --> 00:39:13.370
you may not realize
that it's going to move.

00:39:13.370 --> 00:39:19.010
Martha said when I brooded on what
I felt was the insolvable problem

00:39:19.010 --> 00:39:23.610
of representing Medea flying to
return to her father, the sun,

00:39:23.610 --> 00:39:28.330 position:56%
Isamu devised a dress for me, worked
from the vibrating brilliant pieces

00:39:28.330 --> 00:39:34.810
of bronze wire, that became my
garment and my chariot of flames.

00:39:34.810 --> 00:39:42.460
I also think that it becomes
her glittering evil aura

00:39:42.460 --> 00:39:43.760
in these last moments.

00:39:43.760 --> 00:39:46.050
So I'm just going to show I'm not
going to show you the very end,

00:39:46.050 --> 00:39:48.350
but I'll show you a
little bit of it.

That's all you get.

00:40:39.340 --> 00:40:40.640
You got to come back and see more.

00:40:40.640 --> 00:40:42.310
Well, that's my story.

00:40:42.310 --> 00:40:49.040
I'm happy to take any questions
and anything you'd like to know

00:40:49.040 --> 00:40:52.530
about the set or the dance or
what we're bringing this weekend.

00:40:52.530 --> 00:40:53.830

00:40:59.170 --> 00:41:03.200
Thank you.

00:41:03.200 --> 00:41:04.500
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:41:04.500 --> 00:41:05.800
Where are

00:41:05.800 --> 00:41:07.100
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: Just a second.

00:41:07.100 --> 00:41:08.400
&gt;&gt; Microphone.

00:41:08.400 --> 00:41:09.700
&gt;&gt; Janet Eilber: Oh, they
want you to have a microphone.

00:41:09.700 --> 00:41:11.000
&gt;&gt; Yes. Where are you?

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:13.300
&gt;&gt; Janet Eilber: Right here.

00:41:14.690 --> 00:41:17.300
&gt;&gt; Where are the original 20 sets?

00:41:17.300 --> 00:41:20.900
&gt;&gt; Janet Eilber: We
have some of them.

00:41:20.900 --> 00:41:28.890
Some have left us, have some
private owners at this point.

00:41:28.890 --> 00:41:36.120
Do you want to hear the
Hurricane Sandy story?

00:41:37.750 --> 00:41:40.970
About almost four years
ago now we moved

00:41:40.970 --> 00:41:44.370
into Merce Cunningham's studios
down in the West Village,

00:41:44.370 --> 00:41:46.730
which we still are not sorry about,

00:41:46.730 --> 00:41:50.140
and about three months later
Hurricane Sandy hit and all

00:41:50.140 --> 00:41:52.810
of our sets and costumes,
and many other things,

00:41:52.810 --> 00:41:56.870
were down in the basement and
under water for about two weeks

00:41:56.870 --> 00:41:59.220
because there was no
electricity to Lower Manhattan

00:41:59.220 --> 00:42:02.020
and we couldn't pump it out
and there were, of course,

00:42:02.020 --> 00:42:04.020
many other more urgent situations.

00:42:04.020 --> 00:42:10.710
So none of the Noguchi
sets were destroyed.

00:42:10.710 --> 00:42:12.010
They were damaged.

00:42:12.010 --> 00:42:14.280
They need painting and fixing
and that sort of thing.

00:42:14.280 --> 00:42:17.400
So we've been working hard.

00:42:17.400 --> 00:42:22.160
And, in fact, this is new.

00:42:22.160 --> 00:42:25.590
This "Cave of the Heart" on Friday
night will be the first cast

00:42:25.590 --> 00:42:27.560
to use the new set.

00:42:27.560 --> 00:42:29.920
We've restored the old set,

00:42:29.920 --> 00:42:35.180
but we also have created a
new set with the help of FEMA.

00:42:35.180 --> 00:42:38.430
And that is really a short
version of the story.

00:42:38.430 --> 00:42:41.960
It was quite we didn't miss
any performances and all

00:42:41.960 --> 00:42:43.360
of our dancers were fully clothed.

00:42:43.360 --> 00:42:46.370
We had over 5,000 costumes
in the basement and --

00:42:46.370 --> 00:42:49.150
you know, I mean, a 90 year
legacy, it's like, you know,

00:42:49.150 --> 00:42:51.380
sort of a closet that hasn't
been cleaned out in 90 years.

00:42:51.380 --> 00:42:54.890
We had a lot of stuff, so.

00:42:54.890 --> 00:42:58.550
But we worked with the
Noguchi Foundation and Museum

00:42:58.550 --> 00:43:02.180
and to really try to
restore the sets

00:43:02.180 --> 00:43:06.400
and understand what
the original was like.

00:43:06.400 --> 00:43:08.600
We've had other iterations.

00:43:08.600 --> 00:43:11.640
The sets have been in use
constantly over the decades

00:43:11.640 --> 00:43:14.180
so they have been replaced before.

00:43:14.180 --> 00:43:19.270
And in my opinion, the middle
age version that was created

00:43:19.270 --> 00:43:22.010
after I danced in the
company was too shiny

00:43:22.010 --> 00:43:25.360
and the colors were too bright
and you know, so we're trying

00:43:25.360 --> 00:43:30.320
to get back to the original
looks of the set as best we can.

00:43:30.320 --> 00:43:32.960
Only black and white
photos exist, you know,

00:43:32.960 --> 00:43:38.120
so you don't know the exact
colors, that sort of thing.

00:43:38.120 --> 00:43:39.440
&gt;&gt; Yes. Hi there.

00:43:39.440 --> 00:43:44.800
I'm wondering, just seeing her up
close in that last two sections,

00:43:44.800 --> 00:43:47.450
what was her ethnicity;
what was Martha's ethnicity?

00:43:47.450 --> 00:43:48.750
&gt;&gt; Janet Eilber: That
was not Martha.

00:43:48.750 --> 00:43:50.050
Sorry. I should have

00:43:50.050 --> 00:43:51.350
&gt;&gt; Oh.

00:43:51.350 --> 00:43:52.650
&gt;&gt; Janet Eilber: I
should have told you.

00:43:52.650 --> 00:43:53.950
No. This was the cast

00:43:53.950 --> 00:43:55.250
&gt;&gt; She looked so Asian so I thought

00:43:55.250 --> 00:43:56.550
&gt;&gt; Janet Eilber: She
is definitely Japanese.

00:43:56.550 --> 00:43:57.850
&gt;&gt; wait a minute now.

00:43:57.850 --> 00:43:59.150
She looked really different
when she was younger.

00:43:59.150 --> 00:44:00.450
Okay. Okay.

00:44:00.450 --> 00:44:01.900
&gt;&gt; Janet Eilber: This
was a cast from the '80s.

00:44:01.900 --> 00:44:03.200
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:44:03.200 --> 00:44:04.500
&gt;&gt; Janet Eilber: Yeah.

00:44:04.500 --> 00:44:05.880
Martha stopped dancing "Cave
of the Heart" in the '50s.

00:44:05.880 --> 00:44:07.180
&gt;&gt; Okay. Yeah.

00:44:07.180 --> 00:44:08.480
Right.

00:44:08.480 --> 00:44:09.780
&gt;&gt; Janet Eilber: So we don't
have a film of her dancing

00:44:09.780 --> 00:44:11.080
"Cave of the Heart" though.

00:44:11.080 --> 00:44:14.050
&gt;&gt; And another quick question
was did Erick Hawkins dance any

00:44:14.050 --> 00:44:15.350
of those?

00:44:15.350 --> 00:44:16.650
&gt;&gt; Janet Eilber: He
was the original Jason.

00:44:16.650 --> 00:44:17.950
&gt;&gt; He was.

00:44:17.950 --> 00:44:19.250
&gt;&gt; Janet Eilber: Yeah.

00:44:19.250 --> 00:44:20.550
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Thank you.

00:44:20.550 --> 00:44:24.310
&gt;&gt; In terms of the
props and the headpieces

00:44:24.310 --> 00:44:25.610
&gt;&gt; Janet Eilber: Yes.

00:44:25.610 --> 00:44:28.510
&gt;&gt; that were used in
the various dances,

00:44:28.510 --> 00:44:30.620
did Noguchi work on any of those?

00:44:30.620 --> 00:44:31.920
&gt;&gt; Janet Eilber: Yes.

00:44:31.920 --> 00:44:33.220
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:44:33.220 --> 00:44:34.570
&gt;&gt; Janet Eilber: In fact,
that will let me show you one

00:44:34.570 --> 00:44:37.640
of these other pictures,
if I can get back to it.

00:44:37.640 --> 00:44:41.190
In "Errand into the Maze," which
I moved through too quickly,

00:44:41.190 --> 00:44:46.350
but let me see if I can get
to it now, he created "Errand

00:44:46.350 --> 00:44:48.490
into the Maze" is based
on the myth of Theseus.

00:44:48.490 --> 00:44:52.240
Ah, and there he is.

00:44:52.240 --> 00:44:57.690
And Theseus who went into the maze
to battle the monster Minotaur,

00:44:57.690 --> 00:45:01.090
but Martha, of course, sends
a woman on this journey.

00:45:01.090 --> 00:45:05.300
And the maze, maybe in her
own mind, the confrontation

00:45:05.300 --> 00:45:09.330
with her own fears, Noguchi
created this incredible sort

00:45:09.330 --> 00:45:12.540
of cavernous brain space,

00:45:12.540 --> 00:45:18.350
those bones on the side making a
very interesting V-shaped portal

00:45:18.350 --> 00:45:23.470
for this journey, and he
created this staff bone that goes

00:45:23.470 --> 00:45:25.610
across the man's shoulder.

00:45:25.610 --> 00:45:29.460
This mask, he created several
different versions of the mask.

00:45:29.460 --> 00:45:31.600
This is the one we're
currently using.

00:45:31.600 --> 00:45:35.200
But the man, the creature of
fear, dances for the entire dance

00:45:35.200 --> 00:45:37.480
with that bone through
his shoulders,

00:45:37.480 --> 00:45:40.070
does lifts with the
woman and everything.

00:45:40.070 --> 00:45:43.040
It's quite a marvelous contraption.

00:45:43.040 --> 00:45:46.760
Yeah. Yes.

00:45:46.760 --> 00:45:49.970
&gt;&gt; Well, first, I have to say what
a thrill it is to have you here and

00:45:49.970 --> 00:45:51.270
&gt;&gt; Janet Eilber: Oh, thank you.

00:45:51.270 --> 00:45:52.570
&gt;&gt; up close and personal.

00:45:52.570 --> 00:45:54.740
I've seen you on stage
and it's I'm tingling.

00:45:54.740 --> 00:45:56.040
&gt;&gt; Janet Eilber: Oh, good.

00:45:56.040 --> 00:45:58.590 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Thank you so much for being here.

00:45:58.590 --> 00:46:02.510
I'm wondering, in the floor
exercises that you showed,

00:46:02.510 --> 00:46:07.880
are there positions is there
like a canon, like in ballet

00:46:07.880 --> 00:46:09.180
&gt;&gt; Janet Eilber: Yes.

00:46:09.180 --> 00:46:11.640
&gt;&gt; you know, first position, and
so that there is a regimented,

00:46:11.640 --> 00:46:15.970
you know, that you refer
to, you know, when you say,

00:46:15.970 --> 00:46:17.270
you know, position X and Y?

00:46:17.270 --> 00:46:18.570
&gt;&gt; Janet Eilber: Yes.

00:46:18.570 --> 00:46:19.870
We'll do the position,
the fourth position spiral

00:46:19.870 --> 00:46:21.170
on two, four and eight.

00:46:21.170 --> 00:46:22.470
&gt;&gt; Oh.

00:46:22.470 --> 00:46:23.770
&gt;&gt; Janet Eilber: We're going
to the back leg extension,

00:46:23.770 --> 00:46:25.070
we're going to do the
pleadings with the pretzel.

00:46:25.070 --> 00:46:30.930
Yes, it's a codified vocabulary
system that's been compared

00:46:30.930 --> 00:46:34.790
with classical ballet
with its methodology

00:46:34.790 --> 00:46:36.110
and the specificity of it.

00:46:36.110 --> 00:46:37.410
&gt;&gt; Is that

00:46:37.410 --> 00:46:39.110
&gt;&gt; Janet Eilber: So we do
about 30 minutes on the floor,

00:46:39.110 --> 00:46:45.160
starting with simple breathings, we
call them, just lifting the spine

00:46:45.160 --> 00:46:50.190 position:56%
to upright and then contracting, and
lifting and then we give it we start

00:46:50.190 --> 00:46:53.410
to do a spiral and then we
add a head to the spiral

00:46:53.410 --> 00:46:55.840
and then we add an arm
and a leg to the spiral,

00:46:55.840 --> 00:46:58.430
and then it develops from there.

00:46:58.430 --> 00:47:02.800
But, yes, it's very codified.

00:47:02.800 --> 00:47:06.850
And, as I said, because
Martha was bringing movements

00:47:06.850 --> 00:47:10.360
from her stage works, there are
things that we just say, okay,

00:47:10.360 --> 00:47:13.540 position:56%
now we're going to do Cave turns and
nobody bothers to say, by the way,

00:47:13.540 --> 00:47:15.450
these are from "Cave of the
Heart," blah, blah, blah, blah.

00:47:15.450 --> 00:47:18.850
It's just the Cave turns, so.

00:47:18.850 --> 00:47:21.760
&gt;&gt; Is that in some
form that's accessible

00:47:21.760 --> 00:47:24.790
to the public to study or to

00:47:24.790 --> 00:47:27.270
&gt;&gt; Janet Eilber: Well, of
course, we teach it at our school.

00:47:27.270 --> 00:47:29.420
&gt;&gt; Do you have classes
for the public?

00:47:29.420 --> 00:47:30.720
&gt;&gt; Janet Eilber: We do.

00:47:30.720 --> 00:47:32.020
&gt;&gt; Oh.

00:47:32.020 --> 00:47:33.320
&gt;&gt; Janet Eilber: We
have open classes.

00:47:33.320 --> 00:47:34.620
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:47:34.620 --> 00:47:35.920
&gt;&gt; Janet Eilber: And we
have full-time students.

00:47:35.920 --> 00:47:37.220
And there have been a couple
of books written about it.

00:47:37.220 --> 00:47:39.480
They're out of print, but you
can still find them online.

00:47:39.480 --> 00:47:40.780
&gt;&gt; Oh, wonderful.

00:47:40.780 --> 00:47:44.370
&gt;&gt; Janet Eilber: And we are
working Anne mentioned our Google

00:47:44.370 --> 00:47:46.030
Cultural Institute.

00:47:46.030 --> 00:47:51.390 position:56%
If you go to googleculturalinstitute
/marthagraham, search Martha Graham,

00:47:51.390 --> 00:47:54.710
you'll see we have an exhibit
there and it's in three categories.

00:47:54.710 --> 00:47:57.370
One is Martha Graham herself, one
is the Martha Graham Dance Company,

00:47:57.370 --> 00:47:59.390
and one is the Martha
Graham Technique.

00:47:59.390 --> 00:48:03.560
So you can see short films,
a little more explanation

00:48:03.560 --> 00:48:06.400 position:56%
about the language that she created.

00:48:06.400 --> 00:48:08.870
And that exhibit is
going to expand so

00:48:08.870 --> 00:48:10.170
&gt;&gt; Oh, wonderful.

00:48:10.170 --> 00:48:11.470
&gt;&gt; Janet Eilber: But
it's a good start.

00:48:11.470 --> 00:48:12.770
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:48:12.770 --> 00:48:14.070
&gt;&gt; This gentleman here [inaudible].

00:48:14.070 --> 00:48:15.370
&gt;&gt; Janet Eilber: Okay.

00:48:15.370 --> 00:48:17.050
&gt;&gt; Yes. If you could speak of
the collaboration between Noguchi

00:48:17.050 --> 00:48:21.570
and Graham, how the
sculptures were created,

00:48:21.570 --> 00:48:26.050
and was it iterative or
did they just appear?

00:48:26.050 --> 00:48:27.350
&gt;&gt; Janet Eilber: I'm sorry.

00:48:27.350 --> 00:48:28.650
I didn't hear the end.

00:48:28.650 --> 00:48:29.950
&gt;&gt; Was it iterative?

00:48:29.950 --> 00:48:31.250
&gt;&gt; Janet Eilber: Iterative.

00:48:31.250 --> 00:48:32.550
Not really.

00:48:32.550 --> 00:48:36.350
Martha would hypnotize her
collaborators, I think.

00:48:36.350 --> 00:48:39.270
Speaking as one of them, I know
she would certainly hypnotize

00:48:39.270 --> 00:48:40.570
the dancers.

00:48:40.570 --> 00:48:45.250
As she was imagining a new world
that she was going to create

00:48:45.250 --> 00:48:50.030
for the stage she would bring in
books, she would bring in poetry.

00:48:50.030 --> 00:48:53.030
We'd be all warmed up and ready
to go and we'd sit on the floor

00:48:53.030 --> 00:48:56.340
for a couple of days
just listening to her,

00:48:56.340 --> 00:49:03.750
looking through big art books, and
she was drawing us into the world.

00:49:03.750 --> 00:49:08.530
And then she would when I worked
with Martha, she was quite old

00:49:08.530 --> 00:49:11.230
so she would not demonstrate
movement for us.

00:49:11.230 --> 00:49:16.510
She would ask us to look at these
shapes and create something,

00:49:16.510 --> 00:49:18.750
and then she would begin to
manipulate it and shape it,

00:49:18.750 --> 00:49:22.770
and invariably make it harder than
anything that we had put together.

00:49:22.770 --> 00:49:26.340
And I really think she did the
same thing with her collaborators.

00:49:26.340 --> 00:49:29.570
Certainly we know the letters
between Copland and Graham,

00:49:29.570 --> 00:49:33.260
she was sending scripts,
they were considering poetry,

00:49:33.260 --> 00:49:35.940
primitive painting,
religion, the war.

00:49:35.940 --> 00:49:40.490
They were filling themselves
with ideas

00:49:40.490 --> 00:49:45.250
and images before they
began to create the work.

00:49:45.250 --> 00:49:48.060
And I'm sure with Noguchi
it was the same thing.

00:49:48.060 --> 00:49:53.140
They discussed what the theme
would be, what she was going for.

00:49:53.140 --> 00:49:59.100
And he would go and create
something and bring it to her,

00:49:59.100 --> 00:50:03.250 position:56%
and if she didn't like it, she would
say, well, let me think about it,

00:50:03.250 --> 00:50:06.240
Isamu, and he would know she
didn't like it and take it away

00:50:06.240 --> 00:50:09.620
and bring something
else back the next day.

00:50:09.620 --> 00:50:13.390 position:56%
Dakin Hart, who's speaking tomorrow,
speaks from the Noguchi side

00:50:13.390 --> 00:50:17.410
of the aisle and he has much
better information than I do

00:50:17.410 --> 00:50:20.900
about how Noguchi put it
all together for Martha.

00:50:20.900 --> 00:50:27.300
But I think there was this
swimming around in a theme

00:50:27.300 --> 00:50:31.540
that all the collaborators did.

00:50:32.630 --> 00:50:33.930
Yes.

00:50:33.930 --> 00:50:35.230
&gt;&gt; I have two questions.

00:50:35.230 --> 00:50:37.230
One is how much does
that dress weigh?

00:50:37.230 --> 00:50:41.020
And the other one, we saw
"Dancers World" the other day

00:50:41.020 --> 00:50:44.210
and I was wondering what
dance was she preparing for.

00:50:44.210 --> 00:50:46.920
And then that thing that
she puts in her hair

00:50:46.920 --> 00:50:48.220
&gt;&gt; Janet Eilber: Yeah.

00:50:48.220 --> 00:50:49.820
&gt;&gt; and then the brooch, was
that Noguchi or was that her?

00:50:49.820 --> 00:50:51.120
&gt;&gt; Janet Eilber: Totally Noguchi.

00:50:51.120 --> 00:50:52.420
Aren't they beautiful?

00:50:52.420 --> 00:50:53.720
That was "Night Journey".

00:50:53.720 --> 00:50:56.380
She was preparing herself
as Jocasta.

00:50:56.380 --> 00:50:59.610
And that is just a
beautiful headdress

00:50:59.610 --> 00:51:02.360 position:56%
for the queen, a very unusual crown.

00:51:02.360 --> 00:51:05.870
The brooch, at the end of the
ballet, she's lying upside

00:51:05.870 --> 00:51:12.100
down in the bed and Oedipus walks
on top of the bed and leans over

00:51:12.100 --> 00:51:14.960 position:56%
and grabs the brooch off her costume

00:51:14.960 --> 00:51:17.360
and stabs out his eyes.

00:51:17.360 --> 00:51:18.660
&gt;&gt; Ooh.

00:51:18.660 --> 00:51:19.960
&gt;&gt; Janet Eilber: Yeah.

00:51:19.960 --> 00:51:21.260
&gt;&gt; Wow.

00:51:21.260 --> 00:51:22.560
&gt;&gt; Janet Eilber: It's
remarkable, you know.

00:51:22.560 --> 00:51:23.860
&gt;&gt; And how much does
the dress weigh?

00:51:23.860 --> 00:51:25.160
I'm sorry.

00:51:25.160 --> 00:51:26.460
&gt;&gt; Janet Eilber: Oh, you know,
that little woman who was carry it

00:51:26.460 --> 00:51:29.520
around is five foot tall,
so it's not that much.

00:51:29.520 --> 00:51:30.820
&gt;&gt; Very light?

00:51:30.820 --> 00:51:32.120
&gt;&gt; Janet Eilber: Yeah.

00:51:32.120 --> 00:51:34.420
&gt;&gt; Okay. Thank you.

00:51:37.180 --> 00:51:40.000
&gt;&gt; I guess my question was
answered because I was thinking

00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:41.340
about that headdress, too.

00:51:41.340 --> 00:51:43.410
&gt;&gt; Janet Eilber: Yes,
the Jocasta headdress.

00:51:43.410 --> 00:51:47.620
&gt;&gt; But was this done for
Martha's height, this

00:51:47.620 --> 00:51:49.200
&gt;&gt; Janet Eilber: Yes.

00:51:49.200 --> 00:51:50.500
Good question.

00:51:50.500 --> 00:51:53.410
Because I've danced Jocasta

00:51:53.410 --> 00:51:57.050
and the bed's a little
short for me, you know.

00:51:57.050 --> 00:52:01.630
The brass dress has
not changed size.

00:52:01.630 --> 00:52:04.940
Occasionally we've made a
longer bench for a taller dancer

00:52:04.940 --> 00:52:06.680
for "Deep Song" or something,

00:52:06.680 --> 00:52:09.660
but the Noguchi sets
remain the same size.

00:52:09.660 --> 00:52:13.130
But if you I shouldn't
tell you this, but PeiJu,

00:52:13.130 --> 00:52:16.790
our beautiful Chinese dancer
who's dancing Medea this weekend,

00:52:16.790 --> 00:52:23.180
has to go down into the serpent
and take the crown for the princess

00:52:23.180 --> 00:52:29.920
and crawl out between
the snake right here.

00:52:29.920 --> 00:52:32.350
She has to crawl out of here.

00:52:32.350 --> 00:52:36.050
And she doesn't get to use her
hands because she's got the crown.

00:52:36.050 --> 00:52:41.130
So she does it beautifully, but
for her to get up on one knee

00:52:41.130 --> 00:52:45.790
and get her hand underneath
there, you'll be impressed.

00:52:45.790 --> 00:52:49.520
I'm going to knock on
wood I haven't jinxed her.

00:52:49.520 --> 00:52:51.440
Great. One more.

00:52:51.440 --> 00:52:56.330
&gt;&gt; I'm interested in the
spider title to the dress also.

00:52:56.330 --> 00:53:01.270
And then my other question
is how the program was chosen

00:53:01.270 --> 00:53:03.740
for the performances this weekend,

00:53:03.740 --> 00:53:07.020
and particularly what might
we see in the Lidberg.

00:53:07.020 --> 00:53:08.540
&gt;&gt; Janet Eilber: Ah, yes.

00:53:08.540 --> 00:53:10.590
What was the first
part of that question?

00:53:10.590 --> 00:53:11.890
&gt;&gt; Spider.

00:53:11.890 --> 00:53:13.190
&gt;&gt; Janet Eilber: Spider.

00:53:13.190 --> 00:53:14.490
You know, I don't know.

00:53:14.490 --> 00:53:15.790
Dakin might know tomorrow.

00:53:15.790 --> 00:53:18.780
I have a feeling it's
kind of like the elephant.

00:53:18.780 --> 00:53:23.260
It's a sort of an in house
name that we've labeled them,

00:53:23.260 --> 00:53:26.970
but I may be wrong about that.

00:53:26.970 --> 00:53:33.440
Yeah. Tomorrow's program,
we were looking

00:53:33.440 --> 00:53:37.330
at the best scores
created for Graham.

00:53:37.330 --> 00:53:40.790
We wanted to honor the Library's
commissions, which, of course,

00:53:40.790 --> 00:53:45.590
include "Appalachian Spring"
and "Dark Meadow," and because

00:53:45.590 --> 00:53:50.090
of the Medea script ricocheting
around with those artists,

00:53:50.090 --> 00:53:53.820
there's a "Cave of the
Heart" connection also.

00:53:53.820 --> 00:53:59.110
And the Lidberg, the new
work, the Library commissioned

00:53:59.110 --> 00:54:02.740
with the Irving Fine
family under the condition

00:54:02.740 --> 00:54:06.620
that the choreographer would
choose a piece of music composed

00:54:06.620 --> 00:54:09.810
by Irving Fine, who was a
contemporary of Copland's.

00:54:09.810 --> 00:54:13.540
In fact, was at the premier
of "Appalachian Spring".

00:54:13.540 --> 00:54:18.260
So we have some beautiful
mid 20th century music

00:54:18.260 --> 00:54:25.100
and that this very 21st
century choreographer has used

00:54:25.100 --> 00:54:27.790
to create "Woodlands".

00:54:27.790 --> 00:54:32.730
It's a beautiful work.

00:54:32.730 --> 00:54:37.700
It's for nine, ten dancers maybe.

00:54:37.700 --> 00:54:41.470
It's largely a group work.

00:54:41.470 --> 00:54:47.510
He's not given away too many
specifics, but because its title is

00:54:47.510 --> 00:54:50.080
"Woodlands," when I see it --

00:54:50.080 --> 00:54:55.220
and it's a very complex,
geometric, flowing work.

00:54:55.220 --> 00:55:04.670
I think it has to do with
being in the woods, you know,

00:55:04.670 --> 00:55:10.250
but in every permutation
of that idea,

00:55:10.250 --> 00:55:14.150 position:56%
both psychologically and physically.

00:55:14.150 --> 00:55:18.510
It's really quite a lovely
caper, I have to say.

00:55:18.510 --> 00:55:21.100
[ Inaudible comment ]

00:55:21.100 --> 00:55:28.500
&gt;&gt; Janet Eilber: Microphone,
microphone.

00:55:28.500 --> 00:55:34.480
&gt;&gt; In the first little segment
you showed us of Martha dancing

00:55:34.480 --> 00:55:39.530
in the costume, she does these
little she lifts both legs,

00:55:39.530 --> 00:55:43.290
and that seems to be
something she does a lot.

00:55:43.290 --> 00:55:49.830
Is there something she a meaning
for her about the little hops?

00:55:49.830 --> 00:55:51.130
&gt;&gt; Janet Eilber: Little hops.

00:55:51.130 --> 00:55:52.430
&gt;&gt; You know, the

00:55:52.430 --> 00:55:53.730
&gt;&gt; Janet Eilber: In the "Cave
of the Heart" Medea one, or

00:55:53.730 --> 00:55:57.680
&gt;&gt; The one where she's in
the beautiful red gown.

00:55:57.680 --> 00:56:00.500
I guess that's the Medea character.

00:56:00.500 --> 00:56:04.840
And she's posing like that
and she jumps up twice.

00:56:04.840 --> 00:56:06.140
She lifts both legs up.

00:56:06.140 --> 00:56:07.440
&gt;&gt; Janet Eilber: Oh, oh.

00:56:07.440 --> 00:56:08.740
I know what you mean.

00:56:08.740 --> 00:56:10.040
The chorus.

00:56:10.040 --> 00:56:11.340
No, that's my role.

00:56:11.340 --> 00:56:12.640
That's not Martha.

00:56:12.640 --> 00:56:15.230
Yeah. She does these very
flatfooted jumps on occasion.

00:56:15.230 --> 00:56:20.440
And again, as the antithesis of
that light, airy, pointed foot leap

00:56:20.440 --> 00:56:22.790
that a ballet dancer would do.

00:56:22.790 --> 00:56:28.040
It's more stamping her foot,
yeah, especially for that the role

00:56:28.040 --> 00:56:30.400
of the chorus, where
she's trying not

00:56:30.400 --> 00:56:35.020
to tell you anything
emphatically, boom, boom.

00:56:35.020 --> 00:56:36.320
Yep. Yeah.

00:56:36.320 --> 00:56:38.790
Did we do it?

00:56:38.790 --> 00:56:40.090
Great. Thank you all for coming.
