[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:08.200
-Welcome to Silicon Valley.

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:12.050
I'm looking for the
next big invention.

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:15.940
-And I'm here to kick
your ass into shape.

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:18.340
I am going to conquer the world!

00:00:21.148 --> 00:00:23.060
This is your life!

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:24.540
-We make dreams a reality.

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:26.713
-In the end, it could
be worth bazillions.

00:00:26.713 --> 00:00:28.605
-A million dollars in revenue!

00:00:28.605 --> 00:00:29.551

[END PLAYBACK]

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:36.540
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Hi, everyone.

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:37.520
Welcome to "Talks at Google."

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:38.603
My name is Dana Han-Klein.

00:00:38.603 --> 00:00:40.250
And today, it is my
pleasure to welcome

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:42.860
Dave McClure from 500
Startups and Brady Forrest

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:43.510
from Highway1.

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:45.010
Let's give them a
round of applause.

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:45.781
[CHEERS]

00:00:45.781 --> 00:00:47.689
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:50.772
Guys, welcome to Google.

00:00:50.772 --> 00:00:52.980
Do you mind telling us a
little bit about yourselves,

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.355
and how have you
found yourselves

00:00:54.355 --> 00:00:56.490
as sort of members of the
Bazillion Dollar Club?

00:00:59.142 --> 00:01:00.850
BRADY FORREST: I don't
think either of us

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:02.280
are quite bazillionaires yet.

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.800
DAVE MCCLURE: Yeah,
still working on it.

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.840
I started off as a small
boy in a farm town.

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.610
Grew up on the East Coast--
West Virginia and Maryland.

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:15.420
Went to Hopkins.

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.320
Kind of came out to California
as a geek and programmer

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:24.190
in '89, which seems like
such a long time ago now.

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:27.200
But variously had
different roles

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.800
here in the valley--
programmer, entrepreneur.

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.740
Worked at Paypal doing
some marketing for awhile.

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.510
Angel Investor, and then
eventually venture capitalist,

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:38.950
I guess.

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:39.780
Yeah.

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:40.770
Sort of.

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.810
BRADY FORREST: I
grew up in Jersey.

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.400
Went to RPI, engineering.

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.977
Did inventory control
systems for awhile.

00:01:47.977 --> 00:01:49.060
DAVE MCCLURE: Fascinating.

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:49.976
BRADY FORREST: I know.

00:01:49.976 --> 00:01:51.730
It was amazing.

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:55.190
Then consumer software,
then O'Reilly Media,

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:58.740
where I started Ignite
and then ended up

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.370
running a hardware accelerator.

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:03.850
And luckily, Dave and I
had met back in 2005, back

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:08.069
when I was still at Microsoft,
and you were at Simply Hired.

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.860
And we just stayed in
touch over the years.

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.110
And about two years
ago, Dave was like, hey,

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:13.710
I'm thinking about
doing a TV show.

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:17.320
But would you-- they also
want hardware in this.

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.124
Do you want to get involved?

00:02:19.124 --> 00:02:20.665
DAVE MCCLURE:
Basically, I was trying

00:02:20.665 --> 00:02:23.180
to work my way into a TV show,
but I needed somebody sexier

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.680
than--

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:24.410
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:24.605 --> 00:02:26.480
DAVE MCCLURE: [INAUDIBLE]
was doing hardware.

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:27.780
DANA HAN-KLEIN: To amplify
the sexy, you know.

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:28.360
DAVE MCCLURE: Yeah.

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:29.280
Well, you know, look.

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.780
With this package,
I mean, come on.

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.000
But yeah, I guess--
it took a while.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.500
Eventually, we
kind of got there.

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.940
BRADY FORREST: And now Highway1
is a hardware accelerator

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:44.880
in San Francisco, and our fifth
batch started two weeks ago.

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.570
DAVE MCCLURE: And I guess 500
Startups is an accelerator.

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:48.070
Whoa!

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:49.028
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Oh, no!

00:02:49.028 --> 00:02:51.000
DAVE MCCLURE: I'm
breaking my shit.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.070
And seed fund.

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:54.930
And we're mostly in San
Francisco and Mountain View,

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.290
but also about 15 other
countries around the world.

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:59.280
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Great.

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.700
Can you walk us through
just a typical schedule

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.447
for an accelerator program.

00:03:04.447 --> 00:03:06.780
DAVE MCCLURE: I guess it
varies by program, but probably

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.300
between three to six months.

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:10.120
Ours is usually
about four months

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:13.040
of kind of active involvement,
although there's maybe a month

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:16.260
on either side hazing people
coming in and kicking them

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:17.700
out on the way out.

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:18.533
BRADY FORREST: Yeah.

00:03:18.533 --> 00:03:20.042
They don't like to leave.

00:03:20.042 --> 00:03:21.000
The free office space--

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.108
DAVE MCCLURE: We
give them money,

00:03:21.108 --> 00:03:21.200
and they just hang around.

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.665
BRADY FORREST: --and the snacks,
and in our case, the shop.

00:03:23.665 --> 00:03:24.540
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Yeah.

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:25.873
We know nothing about that here.

00:03:28.864 --> 00:03:30.780
BRADY FORREST: I've heard
about the Google 15.

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:31.350
DANA HAN-KLEIN: It's the 20.

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:32.020
The Google 20.

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:34.172
Yeah, 15 was college.

00:03:34.172 --> 00:03:36.330
But could you talk to us
a little bit, just about

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:37.690
for those who don't
necessarily know

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:39.856
what it's like to be in an
accelerated program, kind

00:03:39.856 --> 00:03:42.810
of the things that are involved
for the sort of mentees,

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:45.807
or the applicants, and what they
can expect to gain out of it,

00:03:45.807 --> 00:03:47.890
and what you guys are going
to provide as mentors.

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:49.765
BRADY FORREST: Well,
each accelerator program

00:03:49.765 --> 00:03:50.980
has a different specialty.

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:52.860
Ours, in particular,
focuses on hardware.

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:55.880
So we have 1,000 square
feet of shop space.

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:59.040
I've got mechanical engineers,
electrical engineer, a shop

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.160
tech, a designer, all
of whom specialize

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.480
in helping to move
companies with a prototype

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:07.530
forward until it
becomes a product.

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:09.092
At the same time,
we work with them

00:04:09.092 --> 00:04:11.050
trying to figure out, if
they're consumer, what

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:13.934
their crowdfunding strategy is,
what their revenue model looks

00:04:13.934 --> 00:04:15.350
like, how they can
actually afford

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:18.459
to manufacture the product.

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:22.089
Along the way, we also help
them out with their pitch.

00:04:22.089 --> 00:04:23.960
Because at the end of
the day, on your demo

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:26.100
today, you want to be
able to tell your story

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:28.297
and show your product.

00:04:28.297 --> 00:04:30.130
DAVE MCCLURE: I think
there's a lot of stuff

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:31.421
that we try and help them with.

00:04:31.421 --> 00:04:33.452
The primary thing is
we give them money.

00:04:33.452 --> 00:04:35.410
We try and help them with
customer acquisition.

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:38.300
We try and help them
with additional funding.

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:40.750
But we do introduce them
to mentors along the way.

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:42.930
Most of our companies
are software

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:46.920
focused, whether that's
web or internet or mobile.

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:49.530
Most of them come in
with a functional product

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:52.650
and usually a small amount
of customers or revenue.

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:55.190
We hopefully try and help
them get to a larger amount

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:56.650
of customers and revenue.

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:58.256
DANA HAN-KLEIN: A
bazillion dollars.

00:04:58.256 --> 00:04:59.744
DAVE MCCLURE: A
bazillion dollars!

00:04:59.744 --> 00:05:01.970
Muah ha ha.

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:06.170
And most of this culminates in
a demo day with the companies

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:08.840
presenting their products to
a large room of-- hopefully

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:10.480
a large room of investors.

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:14.420
And if they're fortunate, some
of them raise a million bucks.

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:15.432
Some of them don't.

00:05:15.432 --> 00:05:17.140
BRADY FORREST: And
kind of the difference

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:20.920
is, generally my teams are
trying to make one of something

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:22.060
by the end of the program.

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:25.230
So one of the teams,
Spin, from the show,

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:28.754
is trying to make a
centrifugal coffee machine.

00:05:28.754 --> 00:05:30.420
And they've made a
couple of prototypes,

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:32.670
and they're trying to make
a final prototype that they

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:35.390
can then really demonstrate
that the product works

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:37.290
and is worth investing in.

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:38.430
DAVE MCCLURE: Right.

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:39.540
DANA HAN-KLEIN: And can
you guys talk a little bit

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:42.110
about, you know, you do
have different emphasis--

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:44.340
emphasisses, emphasi?

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:45.761
DAVE MCCLURE: Emphases.

00:05:45.761 --> 00:05:46.802
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Emphases?

00:05:46.802 --> 00:05:48.500
You know, in terms
of your backgrounds,

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:49.750
in terms of what you focus on.

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:51.374
But this show is kind
of bringing those

00:05:51.374 --> 00:05:52.360
together a little bit.

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:54.680
And it's also-- you guys
tend, it seems like,

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:57.995
have different
mentor styles maybe?

00:05:57.995 --> 00:05:58.870
DAVE MCCLURE: Really?

00:05:58.870 --> 00:05:59.145
BRADY FORREST: No, no, no.

00:05:59.145 --> 00:06:00.978
DAVE MCCLURE: We're
exactly the same person.

00:06:00.978 --> 00:06:01.910
DANA HAN-KLEIN: What?

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:04.030
BRADY FORREST: We finish
each other's sentences.

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:06.515
DAVE MCCLURE: Exactly.

00:06:06.515 --> 00:06:07.880
Um, yeah.

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:09.174
Maybe just a tiny--

00:06:09.174 --> 00:06:11.340
DANA HAN-KLEIN: So what's
that collaborative process

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:13.427
kind of been like on this?

00:06:13.427 --> 00:06:14.510
Or you can say no comment.

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:16.610
BRADY FORREST: Pretty seat
of the pants, actually.

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:18.693
We've been kind of figuring
it out as we go along.

00:06:18.693 --> 00:06:22.290
But it's been interesting to
help each other's companies

00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:22.810
out.

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:28.150
Because Dave has wisely
avoided hardware for years.

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:31.029
DAVE MCCLURE: One of the
companies in the show

00:06:31.029 --> 00:06:32.820
is hardware-based out
of our program, which

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:35.920
has been great for them
to get access to Brady,

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:37.077
and [INAUDIBLE] and PCH.

00:06:37.077 --> 00:06:37.910
BRADY FORREST: Yeah.

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:39.760
And this is bringing
me back to software,

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:41.582
which was my roots
for a long time,

00:06:41.582 --> 00:06:43.040
especially working
with developers.

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:46.260
So I think we've
just been trading

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.480
off our complementary
skills here.

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:50.230
DAVE MCCLURE: But I
think there's probably

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:53.642
a set up as the odd couple of
the nerd kingdoms of sorts.

00:06:53.642 --> 00:06:55.100
BRADY FORREST:
Yeah, you don't want

00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:56.683
to read the pilot
for the second show.

00:06:56.683 --> 00:06:58.160
DANA HAN-KLEIN: [INAUDIBLE].

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:01.480
I think maybe we do.

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:05.680
So like the Bay Area is pretty
immersed in the tech culture.

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:08.480
But are there some
kind of things

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:10.890
that you'd want an audience
who aren't necessarily

00:07:10.890 --> 00:07:13.050
familiar with the
challenges of being

00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:16.600
in this sort of environment
to know going into it?

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:18.810
DAVE MCCLURE: I mean, I
think the intent of the show

00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:22.290
is to be entertaining, but also
to tell the story of what it's

00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:24.770
like to be doing a
startup in the Bay Area,

00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:27.820
and not to manufacture too
much of that story line.

00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:30.380
I think we're really trying to
be somewhat authentic to what

00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:32.230
people go through.

00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:36.360
You don't really need to
create a lot of drama.

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:40.040
Startups have enough fail
by themselves that it's

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:42.670
pretty dramatic already.

00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:44.950
Software companies raise money.

00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:46.470
Startup founders break up.

00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:47.880
Sometimes their shit works.

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:49.282
Sometimes it doesn't.

00:07:49.282 --> 00:07:50.990
BRADY FORREST: I mean,
one of the reasons

00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:53.300
I wanted to do the
show is because you

00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:54.950
read a lot about
funding announcements,

00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:58.020
and I think people
outside Silicon Valley

00:07:58.020 --> 00:07:59.590
think that's all
that happens here.

00:07:59.590 --> 00:08:01.215
But it's actually a
lot of long nights.

00:08:01.215 --> 00:08:02.840
It's a lot of friendships.

00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:05.370
It's a lot of really
trying to create something.

00:08:05.370 --> 00:08:09.750
And that's what I want to show,
and that's what I'm hoping

00:08:09.750 --> 00:08:10.940
is shown.

00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:11.860
DAVE MCCLURE: And I
think, also, there's

00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:13.740
a lot of people who have the
misconception that everything

00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:16.160
turns out to be Facebook,
or Snapchat, or Google.

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:18.997
And actually, most shit fails.

00:08:18.997 --> 00:08:19.837
BRADY FORREST: Yeah.

00:08:19.837 --> 00:08:21.920
DAVE MCCLURE: I think
fortunately in our programs,

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:23.620
at least they have
some survivability

00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:24.560
for a year or two.

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:27.890
And the majority of companies
do raise enough money

00:08:27.890 --> 00:08:30.920
to have at least a shot at
becoming something interesting.

00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:31.400
DANA HAN-KLEIN:
Every once in awhile

00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:32.484
you get a wildfire, maybe.

00:08:32.484 --> 00:08:33.858
DAVE MCCLURE: We
do occasionally.

00:08:33.858 --> 00:08:35.932
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Which
we've heard of here.

00:08:35.932 --> 00:08:37.390
No, I think there's
definitely sort

00:08:37.390 --> 00:08:40.100
of a glamour associated with
the kind of startup culture

00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:40.850
that we feel here.

00:08:40.850 --> 00:08:42.789
And a lot of people
are afraid of revealing

00:08:42.789 --> 00:08:45.762
the tough parts of it and the
struggle that goes into it.

00:08:45.762 --> 00:08:47.470
And do you think this
is going to open up

00:08:47.470 --> 00:08:50.750
that conversation,
between both the people

00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:52.670
who are trying to enter
into these fields,

00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:55.152
and the people who aren't
as familiar with it?

00:08:55.152 --> 00:08:57.610
BRADY FORREST: I think it'll
give them a good feel for what

00:08:57.610 --> 00:08:58.502
the pressure is like.

00:08:58.502 --> 00:08:59.960
I mean, you're
working with people,

00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:01.600
when you don't have much money.

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:03.680
Some cases, you're just
getting to know them,

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:05.570
and you're trying
to create something.

00:09:05.570 --> 00:09:07.160
And just the pressure
they're under

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:11.162
is pretty unimaginable, if
you're not in there with them.

00:09:11.162 --> 00:09:12.620
DAVE MCCLURE: I
think maybe there's

00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:17.210
been some other treatments on
different shows in the past,

00:09:17.210 --> 00:09:20.040
maybe some other ones that
are more recent, where it's

00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:22.880
a little bit more
fanciful, and it's

00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:25.600
maybe not what exactly
happens-- a little bit too

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:27.840
much of either nightclubs
in San Francisco,

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:30.270
or people just like coding.

00:09:30.270 --> 00:09:32.030
And that's certainly part of it.

00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:35.370
But I think trying to present
that people are getting

00:09:35.370 --> 00:09:38.000
ready to pitch to
investors, how they figure

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.220
whether the product is
working, whether people

00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:42.200
like the product.

00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:45.100
Figuring out how to grow a
small business into a larger

00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:45.996
business.

00:09:45.996 --> 00:09:47.870
BRADY FORREST: And also,
I mean, these people

00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:50.400
have been working on
it for months or years

00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:51.420
before coming to us.

00:09:51.420 --> 00:09:54.950
And they keep going well beyond.

00:09:54.950 --> 00:09:58.727
We just brought in a company
that's raised about $400,000,

00:09:58.727 --> 00:10:00.310
and they've been
around for two years.

00:10:00.310 --> 00:10:03.309
And they're deployed in 270
homes around California.

00:10:03.309 --> 00:10:04.850
And now, they're
trying to figure out

00:10:04.850 --> 00:10:07.100
how to do mass production
and figure out if they

00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:09.060
can raise additional funds.

00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:11.392
But they're just with
us for four months.

00:10:11.392 --> 00:10:12.850
DAVE MCCLURE: But
I think also, you

00:10:12.850 --> 00:10:16.900
know, there is somewhat a
little bit of the American dream

00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:19.849
writ in the geek fashion,
where people bust their ass,

00:10:19.849 --> 00:10:21.390
occasionally raise
a million dollars,

00:10:21.390 --> 00:10:23.820
and occasionally create a
company that's worth something

00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:26.200
and hopefully grows
on to become larger.

00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:28.240
And that is a pretty
compelling story,

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:29.759
and we hope to
have some of that.

00:10:29.759 --> 00:10:32.050
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Yeah, I don't
think that's just limited

00:10:32.050 --> 00:10:33.341
to the tech industry, you know?

00:10:33.341 --> 00:10:37.780
I think that's what
drives industry.

00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:39.460
So as you said, a
lot of these groups

00:10:39.460 --> 00:10:41.710
are working with these
projects for a really long time

00:10:41.710 --> 00:10:43.040
before they even get to you.

00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:46.400
And sometimes, companies
and groups of working people

00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:48.869
need to make really
tough decisions.

00:10:48.869 --> 00:10:50.410
Maybe in terms of
changing direction,

00:10:50.410 --> 00:10:52.410
maybe in terms of like,
hey, this isn't working.

00:10:52.410 --> 00:10:54.460
What do you say to
people like that,

00:10:54.460 --> 00:11:00.290
when you have to be like, hey,
it's time to change course?

00:11:00.290 --> 00:11:03.930
BRADY FORREST: It all
depends on their resources.

00:11:03.930 --> 00:11:05.280
It depends on the team.

00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:09.584
It depends on whether we
still have faith in them.

00:11:09.584 --> 00:11:10.500
DAVE MCCLURE: Yeah.

00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:12.900
BRADY FORREST: Other investors.

00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:15.400
DAVE MCCLURE: I would say mostly
it depends on the founders.

00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:17.285
I mean, we're not
driving their companies

00:11:17.285 --> 00:11:18.410
or running their companies.

00:11:18.410 --> 00:11:20.650
They are.

00:11:20.650 --> 00:11:23.954
I think, as investors,
at least for us, probably

00:11:23.954 --> 00:11:25.870
both of our programs,
we're minority investors

00:11:25.870 --> 00:11:26.495
in the company.

00:11:26.495 --> 00:11:28.410
We're not taking board seats.

00:11:28.410 --> 00:11:30.770
We're not making their
decisions about where to go.

00:11:30.770 --> 00:11:32.190
We can give them feedback.

00:11:32.190 --> 00:11:37.391
And often, that might be very
harsh and strong feedback.

00:11:37.391 --> 00:11:39.390
But I think, for us, a
lot of it is really just,

00:11:39.390 --> 00:11:41.160
is the product working?

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:43.744
Do customers want to buy it?

00:11:43.744 --> 00:11:44.660
Are they making money?

00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:46.160
Do they have a shot
at making money?

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:46.955
And can they grow?

00:11:46.955 --> 00:11:49.080
BRADY FORREST: Is your go
to market strategy right?

00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:51.380
Are you setting
yourself up to fail?

00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:53.180
I'm doing with a
company right now that

00:11:53.180 --> 00:11:55.630
just joined the
program, and they

00:11:55.630 --> 00:11:57.890
want to launch
crowdfunding next month.

00:11:57.890 --> 00:11:59.740
They don't know their
manufacturing plan.

00:11:59.740 --> 00:12:02.730
They don't know exactly
who their customers are.

00:12:02.730 --> 00:12:04.850
And I'm trying to
pull them back.

00:12:04.850 --> 00:12:07.690
Like, you only get to
go to crowdfunding once.

00:12:07.690 --> 00:12:09.420
You only get one first date.

00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:13.176
Don't screw it up.

00:12:13.176 --> 00:12:14.550
Make sure you're
prepared for it.

00:12:14.550 --> 00:12:16.508
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Show up
showered in a nice car.

00:12:16.508 --> 00:12:17.567
BRADY FORREST: Yeah.

00:12:17.567 --> 00:12:19.400
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Brush
your teeth beforehand,

00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:19.840
all that good stuff.

00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:22.381
DAVE MCCLURE: Some people have
different ideas of what works.

00:12:22.381 --> 00:12:28.249
I think giving people a
reality check on what can work

00:12:28.249 --> 00:12:29.540
and what can't work is helpful.

00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:31.534
And sometimes, that's
the other companies

00:12:31.534 --> 00:12:33.200
in the accelerator
or previous companies

00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:34.870
that have gone
through the program.

00:12:34.870 --> 00:12:36.075
Sometimes it's us.

00:12:36.075 --> 00:12:38.314
Sometimes we're wrong, too.

00:12:38.314 --> 00:12:40.480
I think we're
looking for founders

00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:43.540
who are a little bit
crazy, but not too crazy.

00:12:43.540 --> 00:12:44.990
And there's kind
of a fine line--

00:12:44.990 --> 00:12:45.340
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Passion.

00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:45.690
You want passion.

00:12:45.690 --> 00:12:47.481
DAVE MCCLURE: --between
genius and insanity

00:12:47.481 --> 00:12:49.630
that we try and ride.

00:12:49.630 --> 00:12:54.590
But you want people who are
going to take risks, just not

00:12:54.590 --> 00:12:55.604
stupid risks.

00:12:55.604 --> 00:12:57.020
DANA HAN-KLEIN:
What would you say

00:12:57.020 --> 00:12:59.854
is-- maybe it's needing to
slow your role a little bit

00:12:59.854 --> 00:13:02.395
and being like, hey, let's not
go to crowdfunding right away.

00:13:02.395 --> 00:13:04.170
What are some of the
kind of rookie mistakes

00:13:04.170 --> 00:13:06.544
that you do see, that you wish
you could just tell people

00:13:06.544 --> 00:13:10.110
like, take a step back and
address these things before you

00:13:10.110 --> 00:13:12.425
even possibly go to
these next stages?

00:13:12.425 --> 00:13:14.300
BRADY FORREST: I mean,
on the hardware front,

00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:17.330
it's assuming that you'll be
able to finish manufacturing

00:13:17.330 --> 00:13:19.300
in six months.

00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:22.660
Company formation
front, it's not

00:13:22.660 --> 00:13:24.845
knowing who you're
founding the company with.

00:13:24.845 --> 00:13:27.220
DAVE MCCLURE: I think that's
a big one, is really getting

00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:30.210
to know your co-founders well.

00:13:30.210 --> 00:13:31.920
A lot of times,
we tend to prefer

00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:33.919
people who have worked
together before, at least

00:13:33.919 --> 00:13:38.020
for 6 to 12 months,
if not longer.

00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:40.924
There's a lot of things where
we're really-- unfortunately,

00:13:40.924 --> 00:13:43.340
I don't think it's like people
going to market too quickly

00:13:43.340 --> 00:13:44.298
is usually the problem.

00:13:44.298 --> 00:13:46.220
Usually it's the
opposite problem-- people

00:13:46.220 --> 00:13:49.380
waiting too long to ship or
not getting customer feedback

00:13:49.380 --> 00:13:51.260
early enough.

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:53.950
Sometimes it's being overly
optimistic about funding.

00:13:53.950 --> 00:13:55.940
I think people, even
people who come out

00:13:55.940 --> 00:13:59.310
here who are familiar
with what goes on,

00:13:59.310 --> 00:14:01.270
maybe are overly optimistic
about how easy it

00:14:01.270 --> 00:14:02.462
is to raise a million bucks.

00:14:02.462 --> 00:14:04.586
DANA HAN-KLEIN: You probably
hear a lot about like,

00:14:04.586 --> 00:14:05.880
oh, well, whoever made it.

00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:08.340
Yeah, but different sets of
circumstances, different people

00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:09.817
involved.

00:14:09.817 --> 00:14:10.650
BRADY FORREST: Yeah.

00:14:10.650 --> 00:14:12.691
DAVE MCCLURE: But I mean,
there's a lot of things

00:14:12.691 --> 00:14:15.570
that I think maybe 10 or
15 years ago used to be

00:14:15.570 --> 00:14:16.980
much harder to figure out.

00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:20.250
And we can probably help them
compress that now into maybe

00:14:20.250 --> 00:14:22.610
six months to a year.

00:14:22.610 --> 00:14:24.620
I think just the amount
of resources and access

00:14:24.620 --> 00:14:27.920
that are available, both
online and in Silicon Valley,

00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:32.290
and through investor platforms
like AngelList and others--

00:14:32.290 --> 00:14:34.480
it's dramatically
easier, in my opinion,

00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:36.916
to get a company
off the ground now.

00:14:36.916 --> 00:14:39.020
It used to be,
15-20 years ago, you

00:14:39.020 --> 00:14:40.890
had to know a certain
set of people.

00:14:40.890 --> 00:14:42.920
You really needed
to figure out what

00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:45.700
was going on without having
access to a bunch of user

00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:46.700
groups or online forums.

00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:48.630
DAVE MCCLURE: You had
to get your own servers.

00:14:48.630 --> 00:14:48.960
DAVE MCCLURE: Yes.

00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:50.759
BRADY FORREST: And now
it's a credit card.

00:14:50.759 --> 00:14:52.800
DAVE MCCLURE: Pay Oracle
a couple million dollars

00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:55.357
for database software, and
Sun a couple million dollars

00:14:55.357 --> 00:14:59.190
for some hardware, and
maybe companies like Exodus,

00:14:59.190 --> 00:15:00.980
which probably no
one remembers here,

00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:02.180
that used to host servers.

00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:05.220
BRADY FORREST: I remember
MongoMusic in 2000.

00:15:05.220 --> 00:15:06.687
We had Oracle.

00:15:06.687 --> 00:15:08.270
DAVE MCCLURE: It's
so easy these days!

00:15:08.270 --> 00:15:11.610
Kids my day used to walk
up hill both ways to school

00:15:11.610 --> 00:15:15.160
before they launched
any commerce project.

00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:17.660
So yeah, I think
there's a lot of things

00:15:17.660 --> 00:15:20.702
that are still far from
perfect with the startup world.

00:15:20.702 --> 00:15:22.160
But there are a
lot of things which

00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:27.325
are much faster and easier,
and hopefully we're helpful.

00:15:27.325 --> 00:15:28.810
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Great.

00:15:28.810 --> 00:15:31.060
Let's talk briefly
about pitching,

00:15:31.060 --> 00:15:36.050
because you seem to be very
passionate about the way people

00:15:36.050 --> 00:15:37.790
pitch things and
trying to get people

00:15:37.790 --> 00:15:39.070
to come out of their shells.

00:15:39.070 --> 00:15:40.610
And it's a hugely important
part of any presentation.

00:15:40.610 --> 00:15:40.670
DAVE MCCLURE: Yes.

00:15:40.670 --> 00:15:42.503
DANA HAN-KLEIN: A lot
of this is being like,

00:15:42.503 --> 00:15:44.459
give me a lot of money
please for this idea

00:15:44.459 --> 00:15:45.500
that may or may not work.

00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:45.920
DAVE MCCLURE: That sounds
like a great pitch.

00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:48.054
You should come over
and [INAUDIBLE].

00:15:48.054 --> 00:15:49.440
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Yeah.

00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:52.640
That's my elevator pitch you--
give me a lot of money, please.

00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:54.370
But it's a hugely
important part.

00:15:54.370 --> 00:15:57.820
Can you talk about, one, some of
the challenges of maybe getting

00:15:57.820 --> 00:15:59.810
people who are behind
the scenes people

00:15:59.810 --> 00:16:03.320
to have to be in front
of large audiences

00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:05.930
in a very high stakes scenario?

00:16:05.930 --> 00:16:07.470
BRADY FORREST: It's
hours on stage.

00:16:07.470 --> 00:16:08.928
You have to put
yourself out there.

00:16:08.928 --> 00:16:11.570
And a lot of people, they've
never done it before,

00:16:11.570 --> 00:16:13.210
and it just takes time.

00:16:13.210 --> 00:16:15.710
They just have to keep doing
it, and doing it, and doing it.

00:16:15.710 --> 00:16:17.543
DAVE MCCLURE: I think
there's a lot of folks

00:16:17.543 --> 00:16:20.490
who come from an engineering
and/or nerdy background who are

00:16:20.490 --> 00:16:22.110
not used to public speaking.

00:16:22.110 --> 00:16:27.130
And strangely, I used to be
one of those persons-- people.

00:16:27.130 --> 00:16:31.440
I was deathly afraid of public
speaking probably 20 years ago,

00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:33.830
I guess.

00:16:33.830 --> 00:16:36.300
And most of my training
was not on stage.

00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:38.040
It was mostly
engineering background.

00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:42.430
Although I was bit of a drama
theatre geek in high school.

00:16:42.430 --> 00:16:45.790
But I think the thing
is most folks get

00:16:45.790 --> 00:16:48.050
far too into the weeds.

00:16:48.050 --> 00:16:51.200
Or they want to be Steve
Jobs and tell this very long

00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:52.240
and elaborate story.

00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:55.780
And we do want a little bit of
magic in what they're saying.

00:16:55.780 --> 00:16:57.980
But primarily, we
try to coach people

00:16:57.980 --> 00:17:01.080
to really focus on
the numbers, if they

00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:04.210
have some amount of
traction, is what we call it.

00:17:04.210 --> 00:17:06.660
So whether they've
got a product,

00:17:06.660 --> 00:17:10.089
got customers, got users,
got revenue, got funding.

00:17:10.089 --> 00:17:13.099
Those are all different
measures of traction.

00:17:13.099 --> 00:17:16.536
And so a lot of the pitch
that we try and teach people

00:17:16.536 --> 00:17:18.660
is really what we call kind
of a traction sandwich.

00:17:18.660 --> 00:17:20.420
We're like, here's the numbers.

00:17:20.420 --> 00:17:22.800
Establish some
credibility quickly, then

00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:26.000
tell the customer
problem framework story.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:27.250
Here's the customer's problem.

00:17:27.250 --> 00:17:28.890
Here's our solution
to that problem.

00:17:28.890 --> 00:17:30.850
Here's some proof
that that works.

00:17:30.850 --> 00:17:34.640
And then finish up with traction
and get the hell off stage.

00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:39.815
Try and do that quickly
and clearly first.

00:17:39.815 --> 00:17:41.440
A lot of people want
to be entertaining

00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:42.390
while they're doing that.

00:17:42.390 --> 00:17:43.306
That's the next level.

00:17:43.306 --> 00:17:47.520
But first level is
just be fucking clear.

00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:50.457
Try and be concise and brief.

00:17:50.457 --> 00:17:52.790
And then, if you can work in
some entertainment in there

00:17:52.790 --> 00:17:55.010
after you accomplish
those goals, that's great.

00:17:55.010 --> 00:17:57.250
BRADY FORREST: And your
pitches are two minutes long?

00:17:57.250 --> 00:17:59.630
DAVE MCCLURE: Three minutes,
although we encourage people

00:17:59.630 --> 00:18:01.030
to take less time as possible.

00:18:01.030 --> 00:18:02.820
They hardly ever
take that advice.

00:18:02.820 --> 00:18:07.110
BRADY FORREST: So ours is four,
but we usually work in a demo,

00:18:07.110 --> 00:18:09.000
because it's hardware.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:12.284
And we would do
less if we could.

00:18:12.284 --> 00:18:13.950
DAVE MCCLURE: Pretty
much you're winning

00:18:13.950 --> 00:18:15.770
the customer or the
audience attention

00:18:15.770 --> 00:18:18.510
within the first
30 seconds or not.

00:18:18.510 --> 00:18:21.470
And if you aren't
sexy or interesting

00:18:21.470 --> 00:18:23.220
the first 30 seconds,
it's unlikely you're

00:18:23.220 --> 00:18:25.761
going to get a lot more sexy or
interesting in the next three

00:18:25.761 --> 00:18:28.820
to five minutes or longer.

00:18:28.820 --> 00:18:31.720
So sometimes,
usually less is more.

00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:33.962
DANA HAN-KLEIN:
Absolutely, yeah.

00:18:33.962 --> 00:18:36.420
So not everyone is lucky enough
to get advice from you guys

00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:37.445
directly.

00:18:37.445 --> 00:18:39.700
DAVE MCCLURE: Yes.

00:18:39.700 --> 00:18:41.180
We're so fucking important.

00:18:41.180 --> 00:18:42.680
DANA HAN-KLEIN: But
they're probably

00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:45.216
getting a lot of advice
from other sources.

00:18:45.216 --> 00:18:47.590
And what would you say-- and
sometimes it's really tough.

00:18:47.590 --> 00:18:49.215
It's maybe somebody
who's close to you.

00:18:49.215 --> 00:18:51.340
It's family sometimes.

00:18:51.340 --> 00:18:53.430
It's friends you've worked
with for a long time.

00:18:53.430 --> 00:18:55.390
But that doesn't always
mean it's good advice.

00:18:55.390 --> 00:18:59.660
So what do you guys feel about
trusting yourself and doing

00:18:59.660 --> 00:19:01.950
a gut check versus
taking feedback

00:19:01.950 --> 00:19:03.990
from these other sources?

00:19:03.990 --> 00:19:07.500
DAVE MCCLURE: Oh, our advice
isn't always correct, either.

00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:09.440
BRADY FORREST: Ultimately,
it's your company.

00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:10.340
It's your product.

00:19:10.340 --> 00:19:13.020
And so even when I'm
talking with companies about

00:19:13.020 --> 00:19:16.482
whether or not they
should do crowdfunding,

00:19:16.482 --> 00:19:18.440
ultimately they have to
live with the decision.

00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:19.690
They know their bank accounts.

00:19:19.690 --> 00:19:21.855
They know their risk tolerance.

00:19:21.855 --> 00:19:24.230
But the number one thing they
shouldn't lie to themselves

00:19:24.230 --> 00:19:25.780
about is what the
customers want.

00:19:25.780 --> 00:19:27.550
And so getting the
product in the hands

00:19:27.550 --> 00:19:32.295
of your potential users, that's
stuff that you can't ignore.

00:19:32.295 --> 00:19:33.920
DAVE MCCLURE: I think
both the feedback

00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:38.030
from other entrepreneurs
who've done some of the things

00:19:38.030 --> 00:19:40.750
before is important, as well as
getting feedback of customers

00:19:40.750 --> 00:19:42.310
who are using your product.

00:19:42.310 --> 00:19:45.090
And we still depend a lot of
the entrepreneur's intuition

00:19:45.090 --> 00:19:47.040
about what they
want to do, where

00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:48.510
they feel the product can go.

00:19:48.510 --> 00:19:51.119
But you probably
shouldn't ignore

00:19:51.119 --> 00:19:53.410
people who've gone through
that process a couple times.

00:19:53.410 --> 00:19:55.920
And you shouldn't ignore the
people who are buying or using

00:19:55.920 --> 00:19:57.520
your product.

00:19:57.520 --> 00:19:59.920
BRADY FORREST: Yeah, there's
actually a great book

00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:04.040
by my friend Dan Shapiro
called "The Hot Seat," which

00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:07.520
is about his experiences
as like a five-time CEO.

00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:11.990
There's just like 45
different vignettes about it.

00:20:11.990 --> 00:20:14.112
And he was an
ex-Googler, as well.

00:20:14.112 --> 00:20:16.570
DANA HAN-KLEIN: That actually
leads me to another question.

00:20:16.570 --> 00:20:18.490
What are some of the
inspiration sources,

00:20:18.490 --> 00:20:21.130
aside from maybe people who have
through this process before,

00:20:21.130 --> 00:20:24.250
that you do send your folks to?

00:20:24.250 --> 00:20:27.557
Either books or speakers
in real life, or--

00:20:27.557 --> 00:20:29.390
BRADY FORREST: We gave
everyone at Highway1,

00:20:29.390 --> 00:20:32.590
this class, "The Hot
Seat," which is his book.

00:20:32.590 --> 00:20:35.200
And then we brought in--
we bring in Eric Ries

00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:36.840
to speak, "The Lean Startup."

00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:37.880
DAVE MCCLURE: Eric Ries, who
is the author of "The Lean

00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:39.165
Startup."

00:20:39.165 --> 00:20:40.770
Yeah, I think, you
know, there's a lot

00:20:40.770 --> 00:20:42.660
of folks who are
very knowledgeable.

00:20:42.660 --> 00:20:44.970
And some of them,
if not many of them,

00:20:44.970 --> 00:20:46.220
have started companies before.

00:20:46.220 --> 00:20:49.600
But most of the feedback
that I think is more valuable

00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:51.980
is coming from other
founders, some of whom

00:20:51.980 --> 00:20:53.820
haven't been around
the block that long

00:20:53.820 --> 00:20:55.970
and aren't necessarily
household names,

00:20:55.970 --> 00:21:00.040
but have been through those
experiences more recently.

00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:03.550
We do fireside chats with some
of our founders, a few of whom

00:21:03.550 --> 00:21:06.210
have actually started
companies or exited companies,

00:21:06.210 --> 00:21:08.580
raised 10s if not
100s of millions.

00:21:08.580 --> 00:21:12.106
And a few of them have hired or
acquired thousands of people.

00:21:12.106 --> 00:21:13.980
But a lot of times,
hearing the stories

00:21:13.980 --> 00:21:17.350
from other folks who
are maybe still running

00:21:17.350 --> 00:21:19.380
10-person companies or
20-person companies who

00:21:19.380 --> 00:21:21.370
just went through it
a year or two earlier,

00:21:21.370 --> 00:21:24.830
it somehow maybe seems a
little bit more authentic.

00:21:24.830 --> 00:21:27.990
BRADY FORREST: Yeah, we really
try and connect our cohorts

00:21:27.990 --> 00:21:28.660
together.

00:21:28.660 --> 00:21:32.170
So the first week, we do
a Bay Area factory tour

00:21:32.170 --> 00:21:35.360
so that they're stuck on a bus
getting to know each other.

00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:37.220
And we take them
to China so they

00:21:37.220 --> 00:21:39.450
can see Chinese manufacturing.

00:21:39.450 --> 00:21:42.415
And they really bond
during that trip.

00:21:42.415 --> 00:21:44.790
DAVE MCCLURE: Sometimes we
take them over here, actually.

00:21:44.790 --> 00:21:47.710
We do field trips to Google,
and Facebook, and YouTube,

00:21:47.710 --> 00:21:49.580
and other companies
in the Bay Area

00:21:49.580 --> 00:21:52.150
that are a little bit
larger than our startups.

00:21:52.150 --> 00:21:54.900
And some of that's really to get
to know the different product

00:21:54.900 --> 00:21:56.580
groups and things
that are going on.

00:21:56.580 --> 00:21:58.288
Sometimes it's just
to get to know people

00:21:58.288 --> 00:22:01.034
in the companies who've been
through the process before.

00:22:01.034 --> 00:22:01.950
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Great.

00:22:01.950 --> 00:22:03.690
I think the show
sounds like it's also

00:22:03.690 --> 00:22:06.156
going to be a great way to
kind of open up that process

00:22:06.156 --> 00:22:08.780
and save maybe you guys a little
bit of the time on being like,

00:22:08.780 --> 00:22:11.710
look, these are the people who
have gone through it before.

00:22:11.710 --> 00:22:12.627
But what's one thing--

00:22:12.627 --> 00:22:14.710
DAVE MCCLURE: Sometimes
learning from failure also

00:22:14.710 --> 00:22:15.620
can be helpful.

00:22:15.620 --> 00:22:16.160
DANA HAN-KLEIN: It's
an important process.

00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:16.659
It's true.

00:22:16.659 --> 00:22:18.330
Like you absolutely
sometimes need

00:22:18.330 --> 00:22:21.040
to fail in order to know
what it is to succeed.

00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:25.070
And what's one thing you
hope that people take away

00:22:25.070 --> 00:22:30.020
from being able to see this
in-depth into this process?

00:22:30.020 --> 00:22:32.057
BRADY FORREST: That
it's a lot of work,

00:22:32.057 --> 00:22:33.390
but that it can be a lot of fun.

00:22:33.390 --> 00:22:35.890
DAVE MCCLURE: I think hopefully
buying the bottle-head dolls

00:22:35.890 --> 00:22:37.770
with our heads on them.

00:22:37.770 --> 00:22:39.310
Merchandising!

00:22:39.310 --> 00:22:41.750
BRADY FORREST: We get more
margin on the t-shirts.

00:22:41.750 --> 00:22:42.770
DAVE MCCLURE: Oh, OK.

00:22:42.770 --> 00:22:43.770
BRADY FORREST: T-shirts.

00:22:45.969 --> 00:22:47.510
DAVE MCCLURE: I
think, you know, it's

00:22:47.510 --> 00:22:49.860
really a chance to tell
the story of Silicon

00:22:49.860 --> 00:22:53.220
Valley a little bit more
upfront and in-person.

00:22:53.220 --> 00:22:56.700
Again, you can watch movies
like "The Social Network"

00:22:56.700 --> 00:22:59.920
or read books about
Google or Amazon founders.

00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:03.740
And there's a piece of that
world which is probably real.

00:23:03.740 --> 00:23:05.400
I used to work for Sean Parker.

00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:07.630
I do know some of those stories.

00:23:07.630 --> 00:23:09.370
I know a lot of folks
who have founded

00:23:09.370 --> 00:23:10.369
companies in the valley.

00:23:10.369 --> 00:23:13.000
But I think also just
really getting a chance

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:17.220
to see-- I won't
say normal people,

00:23:17.220 --> 00:23:21.065
but geeky individuals that you
might meet in real life, who

00:23:21.065 --> 00:23:22.940
face all the struggles
of starting a company,

00:23:22.940 --> 00:23:27.367
learning how to be a leader,
or sometimes not measuring up

00:23:27.367 --> 00:23:28.200
to that expectation.

00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:30.030
BRADY FORREST: I
think also, we have

00:23:30.030 --> 00:23:32.120
all different
types of people who

00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:34.280
are starting companies in this.

00:23:34.280 --> 00:23:35.180
We had a Dutch team.

00:23:35.180 --> 00:23:38.450
We had a team that's super
passionate about aquariums

00:23:38.450 --> 00:23:42.500
and just decided
to dive into tech.

00:23:42.500 --> 00:23:44.160
Where are some of
your teams from?

00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:46.080
DAVE MCCLURE: We have a lot of
folks from all over the world.

00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:47.562
Actually, probably
close to half,

00:23:47.562 --> 00:23:49.520
sometimes even more than
half of our companies,

00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:50.860
are from outside the US.

00:23:50.860 --> 00:23:52.480
And hopefully,
they're not always

00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:56.290
as white and male as some
of Silicon Valley is.

00:23:56.290 --> 00:23:59.184
I think that's still a
challenge we all face.

00:23:59.184 --> 00:24:03.170
But at least maybe a
little bit more female,

00:24:03.170 --> 00:24:05.296
non-white and not quite--

00:24:05.296 --> 00:24:07.159
DANA HAN-KLEIN: I
wouldn't mind seeing that.

00:24:07.159 --> 00:24:07.950
DAVE MCCLURE: Yeah.

00:24:07.950 --> 00:24:09.642
So we'll see.

00:24:09.642 --> 00:24:11.600
DANA HAN-KLEIN: We are
in a very diverse world.

00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:14.170
It's no longer just
Silicon Valley.

00:24:14.170 --> 00:24:14.810
It's China.

00:24:14.810 --> 00:24:16.140
It's all these other companies.

00:24:16.140 --> 00:24:19.120
There are different people on
the map who have great ideas

00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:22.080
and are-- so it's great to
see that being represented

00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:23.980
and working on
being represented.

00:24:23.980 --> 00:24:26.230
DAVE MCCLURE: I mean, I think
it's a big focus for us.

00:24:26.230 --> 00:24:29.500
We've been investing outside
the US for the last five years.

00:24:29.500 --> 00:24:31.920
We have probably done
investments in over 50

00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:35.350
countries and have about 300
companies out of the portfolio

00:24:35.350 --> 00:24:37.620
that didn't start in the US.

00:24:37.620 --> 00:24:40.850
It's not to say it's still not
a little bit more white and male

00:24:40.850 --> 00:24:42.500
than maybe we would prefer.

00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:45.410
And I'm not always the poster
child for diversity efforts,

00:24:45.410 --> 00:24:47.266
but I'm trying.

00:24:47.266 --> 00:24:48.950
We have a lot of other
folks on our team

00:24:48.950 --> 00:24:51.279
who do represent
different walks of life.

00:24:51.279 --> 00:24:53.820
DANA HAN-KLEIN: I think being
aware of the problem and trying

00:24:53.820 --> 00:24:57.104
is definitely the first step.

00:24:57.104 --> 00:24:58.770
Can you guys think
of a startup that you

00:24:58.770 --> 00:25:01.019
felt was maybe going to be
a big gamble that you went,

00:25:01.019 --> 00:25:05.298
you know what, we're going
for it, and that paid off?

00:25:05.298 --> 00:25:06.282
BRADY FORREST: Huh.

00:25:06.282 --> 00:25:07.270
DAVE MCCLURE: Uh--

00:25:07.270 --> 00:25:09.066
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Or not.

00:25:09.066 --> 00:25:11.440
DAVE MCCLURE: I think almost
every startup I invested in.

00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:14.140
BRADY FORREST: Yeah.

00:25:14.140 --> 00:25:17.840
Actually, one company from
our first batch-- Queue--

00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:20.270
was at-home medical diagnostics.

00:25:20.270 --> 00:25:24.300
And you could test to see if you
have the flu or inflammation.

00:25:24.300 --> 00:25:27.120
And I just didn't believe
them that it would--

00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:31.150
I was like, that's
Jetsons stuff.

00:25:31.150 --> 00:25:32.675
How are they able to do that?

00:25:32.675 --> 00:25:35.537
And some doctor friends
were like, no, no, no, they

00:25:35.537 --> 00:25:36.120
could do that.

00:25:36.120 --> 00:25:37.745
It's really hard,
but they could do it.

00:25:37.745 --> 00:25:39.215
And so they've done pretty well.

00:25:39.215 --> 00:25:41.006
DAVE MCCLURE: I think
probably one of ours,

00:25:41.006 --> 00:25:42.700
it's one of the
more fun stories.

00:25:42.700 --> 00:25:44.300
We invested in a
company called Maven

00:25:44.300 --> 00:25:50.629
that was started by a black
founder who-- I think he's also

00:25:50.629 --> 00:25:52.170
black and Jewish
and speaks Mandarin,

00:25:52.170 --> 00:25:54.670
but that's kind of
besides the point.

00:25:54.670 --> 00:25:59.430
But the company was
basically powering e-commerce

00:25:59.430 --> 00:26:02.440
for beauty sites,
beauticians that

00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:05.772
focus on the African
American beauty market,

00:26:05.772 --> 00:26:07.730
basically hair weaves
and a lot of other stuff.

00:26:07.730 --> 00:26:11.280
And that company's
done fabulously well.

00:26:11.280 --> 00:26:12.990
They just raised
over $10 million

00:26:12.990 --> 00:26:15.510
from Andreessen Horowitz.

00:26:15.510 --> 00:26:19.250
Although, the first two
years weren't quite as easy.

00:26:19.250 --> 00:26:21.820
I think when we first
invested in the company,

00:26:21.820 --> 00:26:25.150
my partner Christine and I
were eager to try that out,

00:26:25.150 --> 00:26:30.111
but we obviously both weren't--
neither of us were customers.

00:26:30.111 --> 00:26:31.610
But I think it was
the kind of story

00:26:31.610 --> 00:26:34.520
that we felt like was an
underrepresented market.

00:26:34.520 --> 00:26:36.420
And we weren't doing
it out of charity,

00:26:36.420 --> 00:26:37.820
we were doing it out of--

00:26:37.820 --> 00:26:39.444
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Oh,
it's a huge market.

00:26:39.444 --> 00:26:41.790
DAVE MCCLURE: --greed
to some extent.

00:26:41.790 --> 00:26:44.950
And it's really been great to
see that company totally kick

00:26:44.950 --> 00:26:48.980
ass and now is employing
over 50 people in Oakland

00:26:48.980 --> 00:26:51.850
and doing-- I won't
share all the numbers,

00:26:51.850 --> 00:26:56.840
but I think 10s of millions--
we'll see-- in revenue.

00:26:56.840 --> 00:26:59.800
So that's maybe a very
non-traditional Silicon Valley

00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:00.525
story.

00:27:00.525 --> 00:27:01.900
DANA HAN KLEIN:
Yeah, absolutely.

00:27:01.900 --> 00:27:03.830
We're going to throw it to
audience questions in a moment,

00:27:03.830 --> 00:27:05.860
but I wanted to know,
what's an area of tech

00:27:05.860 --> 00:27:08.068
that you guys are excited
to see more development in?

00:27:08.068 --> 00:27:11.080
You've mentioned
medical is definitely

00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:14.781
an emerging more home market.

00:27:14.781 --> 00:27:17.030
DAVE MCCLURE: I think Brady's
got the more sci-fi sort

00:27:17.030 --> 00:27:19.310
of esque stories to tell here.

00:27:19.310 --> 00:27:21.852
BRADY FORREST: You know,
I like wearing my Fitbit.

00:27:21.852 --> 00:27:24.060
But it doesn't actually do
anything for me right now.

00:27:24.060 --> 00:27:27.710
I want things to
give me superpowers.

00:27:27.710 --> 00:27:30.240
Yeah, so we have a
company with us right now

00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:34.290
that actually improves
recovery time from athletics.

00:27:34.290 --> 00:27:38.050
And you can picture these-- it's
like currently $1,000 machines

00:27:38.050 --> 00:27:40.680
that they have for
football players.

00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:42.575
And these would
be $100 stockings

00:27:42.575 --> 00:27:44.536
that you could
wear while skiing.

00:27:44.536 --> 00:27:45.910
And then when
you're on the lift,

00:27:45.910 --> 00:27:49.517
it will help pump the blood up
and help you recover faster.

00:27:49.517 --> 00:27:50.850
And you could wear it on planes.

00:27:50.850 --> 00:27:52.180
Stuff like that.

00:27:52.180 --> 00:27:54.055
That's the type of
thing I'm looking for.

00:27:54.055 --> 00:27:56.180
DAVE MCCLURE: It sounds
like pantyhose for seniors.

00:27:56.180 --> 00:27:56.930
I might need that.

00:27:56.930 --> 00:27:59.429
BRADY FORREST: You are-- I mean,
you just have the marketing

00:27:59.429 --> 00:28:00.330
thing down for me.

00:28:00.330 --> 00:28:00.420
DAVE MCCLURE: Yeah.

00:28:00.420 --> 00:28:01.660
I could [INAUDIBLE].

00:28:01.660 --> 00:28:03.859
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Sold.

00:28:03.859 --> 00:28:05.400
DAVE MCCLURE: I
think we tend to work

00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:08.390
on stuff that's a little
less sexy than the space age

00:28:08.390 --> 00:28:08.890
[INAUDIBLE].

00:28:08.890 --> 00:28:10.473
DANA HAN-KLEIN:
Pantyhose for seniors?

00:28:10.473 --> 00:28:12.060
DAVE MCCLURE: Yeah, exactly.

00:28:12.060 --> 00:28:13.340
BRADY FORREST: Huge market.

00:28:13.340 --> 00:28:15.256
DAVE MCCLURE: A lot of
things that we focus on

00:28:15.256 --> 00:28:17.730
tend to be very straightforward
e-commerce and SaaS

00:28:17.730 --> 00:28:19.390
and marketplace stories.

00:28:19.390 --> 00:28:22.290
But those are happening in
a lot of interesting places

00:28:22.290 --> 00:28:22.910
now for us.

00:28:22.910 --> 00:28:24.850
So sometimes it's
more about where we're

00:28:24.850 --> 00:28:26.820
doing that work than what.

00:28:26.820 --> 00:28:30.550
And so getting to see
e-commerce in Africa,

00:28:30.550 --> 00:28:33.390
or SaaS in India
or Southeast Asia

00:28:33.390 --> 00:28:36.960
is actually pretty exciting
and hopefully also makes us

00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:37.865
some money.

00:28:37.865 --> 00:28:39.240
DANA HAN-KLEIN:
And since this is

00:28:39.240 --> 00:28:42.211
sci-fi, what is one
future technology

00:28:42.211 --> 00:28:44.210
that you'd like to see
realized in our lifetime?

00:28:46.537 --> 00:28:48.495
The replicator from Star
Trek or phasers, or--?

00:28:48.495 --> 00:28:49.602
DAVE MCCLURE: Wormholes.

00:28:49.602 --> 00:28:51.410
Teleportation.

00:28:51.410 --> 00:28:52.082
More sleep.

00:28:52.082 --> 00:28:53.540
Can I get an extra
two hours a day?

00:28:53.540 --> 00:28:54.300
BRADY FORREST: Oh, that
would be really nice.

00:28:54.300 --> 00:28:54.910
DANA HAN-KLEIN: That
would be really nice,

00:28:54.910 --> 00:28:56.370
I think for everyone here.

00:28:56.370 --> 00:28:58.330
We'd all love that.

00:28:58.330 --> 00:28:59.770
DAVE MCCLURE: Tribbles.

00:28:59.770 --> 00:29:01.770
DANA HAN-KLEIN: There's
some trouble with those.

00:29:01.770 --> 00:29:02.922
DAVE MCCLURE: Yeah.

00:29:02.922 --> 00:29:05.350
Wow.

00:29:05.350 --> 00:29:07.266
DANA HAN-KLEIN: I work
at a nerdy company too.

00:29:07.266 --> 00:29:09.010
Don't worry.

00:29:09.010 --> 00:29:11.460
And finally, we see plenty
of startups be successful.

00:29:11.460 --> 00:29:14.420
What's one thing that you truly
think differentiates a rock

00:29:14.420 --> 00:29:17.660
star startup?

00:29:17.660 --> 00:29:19.290
You can say advice from you two.

00:29:19.290 --> 00:29:20.636
Being in your accelerators.

00:29:23.177 --> 00:29:25.260
DAVE MCCLURE: You know, I
hate to say basic things

00:29:25.260 --> 00:29:30.060
like customers, but that's
probably where it comes from.

00:29:30.060 --> 00:29:35.250
I think a little bit of
insanity is probably necessary.

00:29:35.250 --> 00:29:38.690
People who don't always
listen to what you say.

00:29:38.690 --> 00:29:40.190
As much as it's
like, we're supposed

00:29:40.190 --> 00:29:42.200
to be nerd whispers
and helping people

00:29:42.200 --> 00:29:44.419
figure out their startups,
a lot of times the best

00:29:44.419 --> 00:29:46.460
entrepreneurs are the ones
who don't listen to us

00:29:46.460 --> 00:29:48.487
and who teach us things.

00:29:48.487 --> 00:29:49.320
BRADY FORREST: Yeah.

00:29:49.320 --> 00:29:51.620
I definitely want people
who are willing to carry

00:29:51.620 --> 00:29:55.190
through and get things done.

00:29:55.190 --> 00:29:58.560
So much of a startup
is just about execution

00:29:58.560 --> 00:30:00.860
and actually doing what they
say they're going to do.

00:30:00.860 --> 00:30:01.943
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Thank you.

00:30:01.943 --> 00:30:03.735
Do we have any questions
from the audience?

00:30:03.735 --> 00:30:05.151
AUDIENCE: --talk
a little bit more

00:30:05.151 --> 00:30:06.840
about the motivation
and strategy

00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:10.620
for getting involved at
this stage of investing.

00:30:10.620 --> 00:30:12.680
So it's like seed
stage, early stage.

00:30:12.680 --> 00:30:15.730
Especially given you
take minority stakes,

00:30:15.730 --> 00:30:17.640
and you don't have as
much skin in the game.

00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:20.820
So what's the
motivation behind that?

00:30:20.820 --> 00:30:22.670
DAVE MCCLURE: It's
probably a labor of love

00:30:22.670 --> 00:30:24.370
more than anything else.

00:30:24.370 --> 00:30:26.430
The question was, why do
we get involved so early

00:30:26.430 --> 00:30:28.054
when companies are
more likely to fail?

00:30:28.054 --> 00:30:29.530
We don't have
minority ownership,

00:30:29.530 --> 00:30:34.390
and basically we have absolutely
no control over how it goes.

00:30:34.390 --> 00:30:36.931
I mean, one thing is the
companies are less expensive.

00:30:36.931 --> 00:30:38.680
So when we're investing
at an early stage,

00:30:38.680 --> 00:30:41.840
valuations are low.

00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:43.500
Also, it's less
competitive to get

00:30:43.500 --> 00:30:45.310
into those companies
in many cases

00:30:45.310 --> 00:30:48.280
than when they raise capital
from other larger folks,

00:30:48.280 --> 00:30:49.830
if they're more successful.

00:30:49.830 --> 00:30:52.288
BRADY FORREST: And if we're
structuring our programs right,

00:30:52.288 --> 00:30:53.930
we increase the value
of the companies

00:30:53.930 --> 00:30:55.689
in a very short amount of time.

00:30:55.689 --> 00:30:57.230
DAVE MCCLURE: I
think we're generally

00:30:57.230 --> 00:31:01.780
trying to focus on companies
that have challenges

00:31:01.780 --> 00:31:03.742
around product-market
fit and early customer

00:31:03.742 --> 00:31:04.700
acquisition and growth.

00:31:04.700 --> 00:31:06.620
So working around
product and marketing

00:31:06.620 --> 00:31:10.290
are areas that we tend
to focus on a lot.

00:31:10.290 --> 00:31:12.920
As companies get
much larger, things

00:31:12.920 --> 00:31:17.110
start to change into real
more organizational scale

00:31:17.110 --> 00:31:19.174
and operationalizing
a lot of process.

00:31:19.174 --> 00:31:21.090
And frankly, those are
kind of fucking boring,

00:31:21.090 --> 00:31:22.256
and I don't want to do that.

00:31:22.256 --> 00:31:25.130
So it's a lot more interesting
to work with people when

00:31:25.130 --> 00:31:28.850
teams are small, stakes
are frankly higher,

00:31:28.850 --> 00:31:30.970
and we can build a
relationship with them

00:31:30.970 --> 00:31:33.050
and really hopefully
be impactful

00:31:33.050 --> 00:31:35.860
around the product vision and
around the initial customer

00:31:35.860 --> 00:31:36.360
acquisition.

00:31:39.200 --> 00:31:42.950
But I guess it's really kind of
more what people's appetite are

00:31:42.950 --> 00:31:46.177
for what stage of the process
they want to be active in.

00:31:46.177 --> 00:31:47.010
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:31:47.010 --> 00:31:48.385
BRADY FORREST:
One of the reasons

00:31:48.385 --> 00:31:51.470
that I started Highway1
is to help bring things

00:31:51.470 --> 00:31:54.850
into the world that
otherwise wouldn't happen.

00:31:54.850 --> 00:31:58.480
There aren't that many
resources for hardware startups.

00:31:58.480 --> 00:32:00.520
And hardware startups
can get hurt really

00:32:00.520 --> 00:32:01.800
easily by bad decisions.

00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:03.270
So going to
manufacturing too early

00:32:03.270 --> 00:32:06.100
or not having good partners,
not knowing how to model out

00:32:06.100 --> 00:32:08.760
the revenue or their inventory.

00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:10.870
So that's what we try
and teach them how to do.

00:32:13.177 --> 00:32:13.760
AUDIENCE: Hey.

00:32:13.760 --> 00:32:17.520
So I've got a lot of good advice
from Brady over the years,

00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:23.830
but startups get so much advice
from so many different people,

00:32:23.830 --> 00:32:26.560
and so much of it
is contradictory.

00:32:26.560 --> 00:32:28.647
DAVE MCCLURE: No it's not.

00:32:28.647 --> 00:32:29.730
BRADY FORREST: Yes, it is.

00:32:29.730 --> 00:32:31.870
DAVE MCCLURE: No, it's not.

00:32:31.870 --> 00:32:34.173
AUDIENCE: What advice
about advice do you have?

00:32:34.173 --> 00:32:36.105
BRADY FORREST: [LAUGHS]

00:32:36.105 --> 00:32:38.760
DAVE MCCLURE:
That's kind of meta.

00:32:38.760 --> 00:32:41.750
BRADY FORREST: Listen, but
then decide on your own.

00:32:41.750 --> 00:32:43.125
DAVE MCCLURE: I
think the idea is

00:32:43.125 --> 00:32:46.030
that you want to get feedback
from different sources

00:32:46.030 --> 00:32:49.430
and at least hear a
range of opinions.

00:32:49.430 --> 00:32:55.260
I would say I do tend to take
feedback more thoughtfully

00:32:55.260 --> 00:32:57.490
from people who've done
similar things before,

00:32:57.490 --> 00:33:00.439
either on the investor
or the entrepreneur side.

00:33:00.439 --> 00:33:02.480
Again, a lot of that
feedback doesn't necessarily

00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:03.021
come from us.

00:33:03.021 --> 00:33:05.640
It comes from other
entrepreneurs.

00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:09.270
But yeah, you're going
to get a lot of opinions.

00:33:09.270 --> 00:33:10.550
Opinions are like assholes.

00:33:10.550 --> 00:33:11.450
Everybody's got one.

00:33:11.450 --> 00:33:14.400
They all smell bad.

00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:16.484
It's up to you to figure
out which of those you

00:33:16.484 --> 00:33:17.400
want to take to heart.

00:33:28.270 --> 00:33:30.810
AUDIENCE: What is the
profile or characteristic

00:33:30.810 --> 00:33:35.140
of a group of a project, or
already a formed company, that

00:33:35.140 --> 00:33:37.410
should go into accelerator?

00:33:37.410 --> 00:33:42.924
What companies or projects
should not go into accelerator?

00:33:42.924 --> 00:33:44.590
DAVE MCCLURE: Depends
on the accelerator

00:33:44.590 --> 00:33:45.790
and depends on the company.

00:33:45.790 --> 00:33:47.290
But do you want to
talk about yours?

00:33:47.290 --> 00:33:48.123
BRADY FORREST: Yeah.

00:33:48.123 --> 00:33:49.830
I mean, we look for
companies that are

00:33:49.830 --> 00:33:52.020
looking to be venture backed.

00:33:52.020 --> 00:33:54.370
So if you're not
interested in taking VC,

00:33:54.370 --> 00:33:57.160
then Highway1 is probably not
the right program for you.

00:33:57.160 --> 00:34:00.000
And I would think that's true
with a lot of accelerators.

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:03.750
And in our case, we focus
exclusively on hardware.

00:34:03.750 --> 00:34:06.330
So if you're not doing
hardware-- and we

00:34:06.330 --> 00:34:08.710
end up getting applications
for software companies.

00:34:08.710 --> 00:34:11.800
But we look for teams
that have a prototype, two

00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:13.060
to four people.

00:34:13.060 --> 00:34:16.130
Hopefully, they've raised a
couple hundred thousand hours.

00:34:16.130 --> 00:34:21.589
They're past Arduino,
but they've shared it out

00:34:21.589 --> 00:34:22.380
to their customers.

00:34:22.380 --> 00:34:24.440
They've done some
customer validation.

00:34:24.440 --> 00:34:25.780
And we'll take them from there.

00:34:25.780 --> 00:34:27.654
And then those first
weeks, we introduce them

00:34:27.654 --> 00:34:30.300
to designers,
industrial design firms,

00:34:30.300 --> 00:34:33.409
and start to move them
towards a looks like,

00:34:33.409 --> 00:34:35.370
works like prototype.

00:34:35.370 --> 00:34:38.630
And that's our general MO.

00:34:38.630 --> 00:34:41.050
And then, after they leave us,
they head to manufacturing.

00:34:41.050 --> 00:34:44.000
So it's kind of a company
that's on the cusp of having

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:46.045
their final product.

00:34:46.045 --> 00:34:47.420
DAVE MCCLURE: I
think, for us, we

00:34:47.420 --> 00:34:50.562
tend to focus on
companies that have

00:34:50.562 --> 00:34:53.739
a specific stage of product
development and early customer

00:34:53.739 --> 00:34:56.469
acquisition where we can be
helpful in scaling that up.

00:34:56.469 --> 00:34:59.250
So we're generally not
looking for companies

00:34:59.250 --> 00:35:01.920
that are only concepts and
not even just functional

00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:04.080
prototype, but
probably, if they're

00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:06.310
revenue generating,
maybe $5,000 to $25,000

00:35:06.310 --> 00:35:09.600
a month, between maybe
$50,000 to $100,000 a year.

00:35:09.600 --> 00:35:11.421
And in some cases,
more than that.

00:35:11.421 --> 00:35:13.170
But the emphasis we're
going to try and do

00:35:13.170 --> 00:35:16.570
is, can we figure out ways to
be helpful in scaling customer

00:35:16.570 --> 00:35:20.680
channels by 10x,
if that's possible?

00:35:20.680 --> 00:35:23.260
Emphasis tends to be on
online customer acquisition.

00:35:23.260 --> 00:35:27.730
So how do we use paid and
organic platforms, search,

00:35:27.730 --> 00:35:32.370
social, mobile, video, local?

00:35:32.370 --> 00:35:35.270
A lot of efforts tend
to look at maybe Google

00:35:35.270 --> 00:35:37.120
for paid organic
search, Facebook

00:35:37.120 --> 00:35:41.715
and Twitter for social,
Apple and Android for mobile.

00:35:41.715 --> 00:35:43.090
Other things we're
looking at now

00:35:43.090 --> 00:35:48.660
are probably YouTube,
Pinterest, Instagram.

00:35:48.660 --> 00:35:52.546
But even other platforms that
are just text and messaging.

00:35:52.546 --> 00:35:57.810
I think we've been looking a lot
like WeChat, WhatsApp, Facebook

00:35:57.810 --> 00:36:01.310
Messenger, other
messaging platforms as now

00:36:01.310 --> 00:36:03.840
an initial platform for growth.

00:36:03.840 --> 00:36:08.110
So a lot of what we want to
see is early customer usage

00:36:08.110 --> 00:36:10.580
and revenue, but not so much
that the company's already

00:36:10.580 --> 00:36:13.090
off to the races and scaling.

00:36:13.090 --> 00:36:14.811
And then trying to
help them figure out

00:36:14.811 --> 00:36:16.810
online customer acquisition
techniques, not just

00:36:16.810 --> 00:36:17.680
product development.

00:36:17.680 --> 00:36:21.530
So it's a big issue
with a lot of companies,

00:36:21.530 --> 00:36:22.990
not limited to just
Silicon Valley.

00:36:22.990 --> 00:36:25.448
It's going to build feature,
feature, feature all day long.

00:36:25.448 --> 00:36:27.500
And then, oh, marketing
will happen later,

00:36:27.500 --> 00:36:29.856
and our product will be
so amazing that everybody

00:36:29.856 --> 00:36:31.480
will just tell
everybody, and it'll all

00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:34.050
work based on viral
growth and word of mouth.

00:36:34.050 --> 00:36:38.600
And that's usually bullshit, And
the product marketing concepts

00:36:38.600 --> 00:36:43.270
and campaigns are as much a
part of the product as anything.

00:36:46.620 --> 00:36:49.700
AUDIENCE: So actually, to follow
up pretty much what you just

00:36:49.700 --> 00:36:54.780
said there, I work with a lot
of startups that come to Google

00:36:54.780 --> 00:36:58.810
and are looking-- they're
usually Post Series A, a lot

00:36:58.810 --> 00:37:03.180
B2B and Saas, and may not
have had some of the advice

00:37:03.180 --> 00:37:05.650
that you've been trying to
pass on about growth marketing

00:37:05.650 --> 00:37:08.420
strategy being an early
part of your focus

00:37:08.420 --> 00:37:13.140
and trying to make that an
organic part of your growth

00:37:13.140 --> 00:37:14.300
pattern.

00:37:14.300 --> 00:37:17.770
So we get a lot
of post Series A.

00:37:17.770 --> 00:37:20.130
They bring on five
new people who

00:37:20.130 --> 00:37:22.940
are going to be hired through
acquisition, who might not have

00:37:22.940 --> 00:37:26.060
been part of the founding
team, and have all of a sudden

00:37:26.060 --> 00:37:28.820
these huge scaling goals in
order to meet what they've

00:37:28.820 --> 00:37:31.560
promised their investors.

00:37:31.560 --> 00:37:35.530
And in many ways, they want
us to do that for them.

00:37:35.530 --> 00:37:38.390
What advice do you have
for those companies that

00:37:38.390 --> 00:37:42.760
have not already started to
get the groundwork lead earlier

00:37:42.760 --> 00:37:44.860
in the process,
but are already now

00:37:44.860 --> 00:37:49.490
at the point of trying to prove
themselves with a little bit

00:37:49.490 --> 00:37:55.682
less experience coming in
than we may have hoped for?

00:37:55.682 --> 00:37:57.390
DAVE MCCLURE: Probably
take a few classes

00:37:57.390 --> 00:38:01.110
in human psychology,
I would say.

00:38:01.110 --> 00:38:03.395
Strangely, how much
money someone has raised

00:38:03.395 --> 00:38:05.646
is not often correlated
with how far along they

00:38:05.646 --> 00:38:07.520
are in their customer
acquisition strategies.

00:38:07.520 --> 00:38:09.814
And a lot of people
tend to think

00:38:09.814 --> 00:38:11.730
they can just buy growth
later, whether that's

00:38:11.730 --> 00:38:14.545
through hires or throwing money
at paid acquisition platforms.

00:38:16.947 --> 00:38:18.530
I think, fundamentally,
we want people

00:38:18.530 --> 00:38:23.270
to look at what's the initial
activation and retention

00:38:23.270 --> 00:38:25.290
cycle what their customers?

00:38:25.290 --> 00:38:28.180
And is that working?

00:38:28.180 --> 00:38:33.072
And to really dig
in on that first.

00:38:33.072 --> 00:38:35.280
Trying to force a lot of
users through a leaky bucket

00:38:35.280 --> 00:38:37.180
is not going to be an
excellent strategy,

00:38:37.180 --> 00:38:39.904
if that's very expensive.

00:38:39.904 --> 00:38:42.070
So the first thing we're
really trying to understand

00:38:42.070 --> 00:38:45.970
is do people use the product,
and do they come back?

00:38:45.970 --> 00:38:47.350
And do they tell other people?

00:38:47.350 --> 00:38:49.650
Or at least, do they
have a positive opinion

00:38:49.650 --> 00:38:51.320
of the product?

00:38:51.320 --> 00:38:54.350
And then starting to look
at channels for growth,

00:38:54.350 --> 00:39:00.520
if that first set of activation
and retention test is met.

00:39:00.520 --> 00:39:02.280
But I think the hack
that we're really

00:39:02.280 --> 00:39:03.900
trying to bring
to a lot of people

00:39:03.900 --> 00:39:06.160
is the fact that--
everybody thinks

00:39:06.160 --> 00:39:08.740
technology platforms is
what's changed in the last 10,

00:39:08.740 --> 00:39:09.960
15, 20 years.

00:39:09.960 --> 00:39:11.130
And indeed, that's true.

00:39:11.130 --> 00:39:12.170
Prices have come down.

00:39:12.170 --> 00:39:13.820
And things are less expensive.

00:39:13.820 --> 00:39:17.940
But the really dramatic change
that actually has happened

00:39:17.940 --> 00:39:20.830
is around human behavior
and social behavior

00:39:20.830 --> 00:39:21.580
and communication.

00:39:21.580 --> 00:39:24.090
And that people have
dramatically shifted behaviors

00:39:24.090 --> 00:39:28.584
from television, print, and
radio to online platforms.

00:39:28.584 --> 00:39:30.250
And that that's a
really interesting way

00:39:30.250 --> 00:39:32.384
to expose them to new
products and services,

00:39:32.384 --> 00:39:33.800
and for them to
learn about stuff.

00:39:33.800 --> 00:39:37.360
And we really are not
very good at figuring out

00:39:37.360 --> 00:39:39.890
how to do marketing
on those platforms.

00:39:39.890 --> 00:39:43.090
And for a lot of
geeks, that sounds

00:39:43.090 --> 00:39:44.970
like an unnecessary evil.

00:39:44.970 --> 00:39:46.860
They really-- oh,
salespeople are bad.

00:39:46.860 --> 00:39:47.560
That's how I used to think.

00:39:47.560 --> 00:39:48.045
I was a programmer.

00:39:48.045 --> 00:39:49.785
And I was like,
oh, salespeople are

00:39:49.785 --> 00:39:52.364
a necessary evil I tolerate
to maybe get customers

00:39:52.364 --> 00:39:53.030
and raise money.

00:39:53.030 --> 00:39:55.110
But otherwise, they're
scum sucking dirt bags,

00:39:55.110 --> 00:39:57.530
and I really don't want to
have anything to do with them.

00:39:57.530 --> 00:39:59.785
And now, I'm in sales.

00:39:59.785 --> 00:40:03.740
Like, oh, well, there are
some redeeming qualities.

00:40:03.740 --> 00:40:07.450
But I think the idea is around
understanding that there's

00:40:07.450 --> 00:40:09.380
a world of customers
out there that

00:40:09.380 --> 00:40:16.240
are reachable to you via some
amount of calculated marketing

00:40:16.240 --> 00:40:16.740
techniques.

00:40:16.740 --> 00:40:18.406
It's not to say that
things aren't still

00:40:18.406 --> 00:40:20.650
going to be creative.

00:40:20.650 --> 00:40:24.650
But there are billions of
peoples on all those platforms,

00:40:24.650 --> 00:40:26.549
and some of them
are from Google.

00:40:26.549 --> 00:40:27.840
Some of them are from Facebook.

00:40:27.840 --> 00:40:31.880
Some of them from Tencent
and Baidu and Alibaba.

00:40:31.880 --> 00:40:33.990
And kind of learning what
that world is all about,

00:40:33.990 --> 00:40:36.400
and how we interact
with them, is a skill

00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:39.570
set that I think most Silicon
Valley engineers and founders

00:40:39.570 --> 00:40:43.074
still don't understand well.

00:40:43.074 --> 00:40:44.032
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Thanks.

00:40:44.032 --> 00:40:44.990
Over here.

00:40:44.990 --> 00:40:47.500
AUDIENCE: So in a way, I follow
up to this last question.

00:40:47.500 --> 00:40:49.950
Yesterday, I was at a
bookstore in Mountain View.

00:40:49.950 --> 00:40:51.440
I saw "Forbes" Magazine.

00:40:51.440 --> 00:40:53.777
I think it was the
founder of Slack.

00:40:53.777 --> 00:40:54.860
DAVE MCCLURE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:40:57.420 --> 00:41:00.860
DANA HAN-KLEIN: And I think he
has a background in philosophy.

00:41:00.860 --> 00:41:03.270
Sophie And the whole
piece of this month

00:41:03.270 --> 00:41:05.970
was around the
increase in importance

00:41:05.970 --> 00:41:11.060
in non-technical
founders in the Valley.

00:41:11.060 --> 00:41:12.600
I think, at least
as far as I know,

00:41:12.600 --> 00:41:14.640
everything that I had
in mind was always,

00:41:14.640 --> 00:41:17.395
oh, you know, these
MBAs that just

00:41:17.395 --> 00:41:19.370
want the technical
guys to build the stuff

00:41:19.370 --> 00:41:21.760
and who don't understand
really what's going on.

00:41:21.760 --> 00:41:24.004
DAVE MCCLURE: MBAs
aren't inherently evil.

00:41:24.004 --> 00:41:25.170
They're just drawn that way.

00:41:25.170 --> 00:41:25.920
AUDIENCE: Exactly.

00:41:25.920 --> 00:41:31.630
So one thing, what's your view
on non-technical founders?

00:41:31.630 --> 00:41:34.840
And what do you
look for in teams

00:41:34.840 --> 00:41:40.570
that get to your accelerators
or want to work with you?

00:41:40.570 --> 00:41:45.020
BRADY FORREST: I mean, Stewart's
been in technology for decades,

00:41:45.020 --> 00:41:46.000
now.

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:49.455
Slack was not-- he didn't
just dream up Slack.

00:41:49.455 --> 00:41:51.830
DAVE MCCLURE: He started this
other little company called

00:41:51.830 --> 00:41:52.329
Flickr.

00:41:52.329 --> 00:41:56.870
BRADY FORREST: Yeah, he started
a game call "Game Neverending."

00:41:56.870 --> 00:41:58.120
That turned into Flickr.

00:41:58.120 --> 00:42:01.170
Then he started another
game called "Glitch"

00:42:01.170 --> 00:42:03.054
and that turned into Slack.

00:42:03.054 --> 00:42:05.470
DAVE MCCLURE: Someday, he's
really going to prove himself.

00:42:05.470 --> 00:42:06.730
BRADY FORREST: Yeah,
someday he'll figure it out.

00:42:06.730 --> 00:42:09.021
DAVE MCCLURE: He's really
going to get that game thing.

00:42:09.021 --> 00:42:09.750
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:11.570 --> 00:42:13.000
BRADY FORREST:
But Stewart is a--

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:15.220
DAVE MCCLURE: Is
he a non-technical?

00:42:15.220 --> 00:42:18.160
BRADY FORREST: He
must be technical.

00:42:18.160 --> 00:42:21.660
Just because he has
a philosophy degree.

00:42:21.660 --> 00:42:23.320
He must know how to program.

00:42:23.320 --> 00:42:24.237
DAVE MCCLURE: I think.

00:42:24.237 --> 00:42:25.694
BRADY FORREST: I
mean, he certainly

00:42:25.694 --> 00:42:27.280
has partnered with [INAUDIBLE].

00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:28.840
DAVE MCCLURE: You're saying just
because he has social skills,

00:42:28.840 --> 00:42:29.640
he's nontechnical.

00:42:29.640 --> 00:42:30.674
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:30.674 --> 00:42:32.340
AUDIENCE: Maybe not
so much about-- this

00:42:32.340 --> 00:42:33.300
was just an example.

00:42:33.300 --> 00:42:36.364
But in general, not about
him, but in general,

00:42:36.364 --> 00:42:38.280
what's your view about
non-technical founders.

00:42:38.280 --> 00:42:40.590
BRADY FORREST: I'm pretty
sure he doing web consulting

00:42:40.590 --> 00:42:42.410
before he started
Game Neverending.

00:42:42.410 --> 00:42:45.424
DAVE MCCLURE: He's been probably
in the Valley-- well, sorry,

00:42:45.424 --> 00:42:46.840
Vancouver and the
Valley, I guess.

00:42:46.840 --> 00:42:47.050
BRADY FORREST: Yeah.

00:42:47.050 --> 00:42:48.550
Vancouver, bouncing
back and forth.

00:42:48.550 --> 00:42:49.680
DAVE MCCLURE: 15 years?

00:42:49.680 --> 00:42:51.305
DANA HAN-KLEIN:
Canadian Valley, right?

00:42:51.305 --> 00:42:54.590
BRADY FORREST: But
I think if you're

00:42:54.590 --> 00:42:56.721
the person-- if you
are a clear thinker,

00:42:56.721 --> 00:42:58.220
and you are able
to get things done,

00:42:58.220 --> 00:43:00.010
and you are able
to build a team,

00:43:00.010 --> 00:43:02.280
then you don't need
to be technical.

00:43:02.280 --> 00:43:02.979
You--

00:43:02.979 --> 00:43:04.020
DAVE MCCLURE: Wait, what?

00:43:04.020 --> 00:43:06.320
What?

00:43:06.320 --> 00:43:07.907
BRADY FORREST: It's true.

00:43:07.907 --> 00:43:09.490
You know, Kevin Rose
somewhat famously

00:43:09.490 --> 00:43:14.410
paid a developer $5,000 to
build the first version of Digg

00:43:14.410 --> 00:43:17.410
and then was able to raise
some funding based on that.

00:43:17.410 --> 00:43:18.510
DAVE MCCLURE: Poland or
Eastern Europe somewhere.

00:43:18.510 --> 00:43:20.218
BRADY FORREST: Yeah,
something like that.

00:43:22.260 --> 00:43:24.990
DAVE MCCLURE: I think having
basic functional skills

00:43:24.990 --> 00:43:29.120
in programming, and design,
and marketing are probably

00:43:29.120 --> 00:43:31.820
goals for all of us.

00:43:31.820 --> 00:43:35.824
Not just startup people,
but actually everyone.

00:43:35.824 --> 00:43:37.490
BRADY FORREST: Being
able to write well.

00:43:37.490 --> 00:43:39.032
DAVE MCCLURE: Yeah, really.

00:43:39.032 --> 00:43:39.990
BRADY FORREST: Grammar.

00:43:39.990 --> 00:43:41.365
DAVE MCCLURE: But
I think there's

00:43:41.365 --> 00:43:44.030
this weird focus on
programming these days,

00:43:44.030 --> 00:43:46.930
which I kind of think
people are missing the ball.

00:43:46.930 --> 00:43:48.530
Everybody's like,
girls should code!

00:43:48.530 --> 00:43:53.590
And I'm like, yes,
and-- my little girl, I

00:43:53.590 --> 00:43:56.640
want to be running the fucking
company, not just coding.

00:43:56.640 --> 00:43:59.660
So I have a little higher
aspirations for her

00:43:59.660 --> 00:44:02.720
than just coding.

00:44:02.720 --> 00:44:04.880
And so programming is
important, but there

00:44:04.880 --> 00:44:06.421
tends to be this
thing in the Valley,

00:44:06.421 --> 00:44:08.990
like the top of the food
chain is programming.

00:44:08.990 --> 00:44:11.490
And I really think
that's kind of misplaced.

00:44:11.490 --> 00:44:14.340
And I say that starting out as
someone who was a programmer

00:44:14.340 --> 00:44:18.680
and programmed since 11 or 12.

00:44:18.680 --> 00:44:22.010
I took my final in college high,
and got an A+, but whatever,

00:44:22.010 --> 00:44:24.369
on programming.

00:44:24.369 --> 00:44:25.910
There was a time at
which I was like,

00:44:25.910 --> 00:44:28.530
OK, I'm good at programming,
and running a company

00:44:28.530 --> 00:44:29.760
is not just about that.

00:44:29.760 --> 00:44:33.572
As much as really amazing
programmers definitely

00:44:33.572 --> 00:44:35.530
have an advantage, and
companies that have them

00:44:35.530 --> 00:44:37.840
definitely have an advantage.

00:44:37.840 --> 00:44:40.260
BRADY FORREST: But if
you're doing a tech startup,

00:44:40.260 --> 00:44:42.160
you need to be tech literate.

00:44:42.160 --> 00:44:44.387
And so I think that's
probably-- I mean,

00:44:44.387 --> 00:44:46.470
that's what Stewart ended
up doing over the years,

00:44:46.470 --> 00:44:50.280
is he probably taught
himself how to program.

00:44:50.280 --> 00:44:52.430
DAVE MCCLURE: Design and
UX are really important.

00:44:52.430 --> 00:44:54.638
Understanding marketing
concepts is really important,

00:44:54.638 --> 00:44:57.222
whether those are
creative or quantitative.

00:44:57.222 --> 00:44:58.930
And just learning how
to deal with people

00:44:58.930 --> 00:45:01.180
and interacting with them
is pretty fucking important.

00:45:01.180 --> 00:45:04.088
BRADY FORREST: Being able
to understand your customer.

00:45:04.088 --> 00:45:05.550
DAVE MCCLURE: Yeah.

00:45:05.550 --> 00:45:08.820
So it's a little bit more
holistic than just coding.

00:45:08.820 --> 00:45:13.220
AUDIENCE: And what do
you look at in teams that

00:45:13.220 --> 00:45:15.680
apply for the accelerators?

00:45:15.680 --> 00:45:19.465
DAVE MCCLURE: For us, primarily
product and customers.

00:45:19.465 --> 00:45:21.090
I think we want to
look at the product,

00:45:21.090 --> 00:45:22.550
and see how it
works and operates,

00:45:22.550 --> 00:45:25.925
and we want to understand
customer reactions to product.

00:45:25.925 --> 00:45:27.300
BRADY FORREST:
And in our case, I

00:45:27.300 --> 00:45:30.120
want to see that they've
actually built something,

00:45:30.120 --> 00:45:31.640
that they've been
working on this,

00:45:31.640 --> 00:45:35.390
and that they have the
skills to carry it forward.

00:45:35.390 --> 00:45:37.430
DAVE MCCLURE: I think
everybody talks about team

00:45:37.430 --> 00:45:38.660
all fucking day long.

00:45:38.660 --> 00:45:43.010
And yes, team is the
most important thing.

00:45:43.010 --> 00:45:45.110
Except your ability
to tell like what

00:45:45.110 --> 00:45:47.160
that team's all about
in three or four

00:45:47.160 --> 00:45:50.700
meetings over the case of a
couple weeks is pretty limited.

00:45:50.700 --> 00:45:54.200
So unless you've actually
done extensive due diligence

00:45:54.200 --> 00:45:58.074
over periods of
months, if not years,

00:45:58.074 --> 00:46:00.740
it's going to be hard for you to
understand whether that team is

00:46:00.740 --> 00:46:02.611
amazing or not.

00:46:02.611 --> 00:46:04.110
So one of the reasons
we really want

00:46:04.110 --> 00:46:05.970
to see founders
have worked together

00:46:05.970 --> 00:46:09.380
is at least they've assured
themselves that they're not--

00:46:09.380 --> 00:46:12.030
the other person isn't crazy.

00:46:12.030 --> 00:46:15.160
And then we want to look at
maybe some historical work

00:46:15.160 --> 00:46:16.510
that they've done.

00:46:16.510 --> 00:46:22.594
Could be at a company, or could
be at a school or something.

00:46:22.594 --> 00:46:24.510
But probably the most
important thing is like,

00:46:24.510 --> 00:46:26.782
what's my direct experience
of their product?

00:46:26.782 --> 00:46:28.990
And what's the customer's
experience of that product?

00:46:28.990 --> 00:46:31.395
And are KPIs moving in
the right direction?

00:46:33.920 --> 00:46:38.470
It's really easy for people
to make gut decisions about

00:46:38.470 --> 00:46:40.450
whether they think teams
are amazing or not.

00:46:40.450 --> 00:46:42.910
And I think that probably ends
up being why a lot of teams

00:46:42.910 --> 00:46:45.243
are white and male, is because
most of the people making

00:46:45.243 --> 00:46:47.700
decisions are white and male,
and it's a little easier

00:46:47.700 --> 00:46:50.570
for them to make
those gut decisions

00:46:50.570 --> 00:46:53.360
when there are things
that are familiar to them.

00:46:53.360 --> 00:46:55.610
You miss a lot of great
opportunities if you do that.

00:46:55.610 --> 00:46:57.360
Not to say that there
aren't very talented

00:46:57.360 --> 00:46:59.623
white and male founders.

00:46:59.623 --> 00:47:00.890
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:47:00.890 --> 00:47:04.840
I have a question for David.

00:47:04.840 --> 00:47:06.970
I think I remember from
one of your talks is

00:47:06.970 --> 00:47:09.740
that your inspiration
to have 500 Startups

00:47:09.740 --> 00:47:15.110
is you have lots of data points
to improve your decision making

00:47:15.110 --> 00:47:18.910
into which company
to investing in.

00:47:18.910 --> 00:47:19.840
Right?

00:47:19.840 --> 00:47:22.070
DAVE MCCLURE: The goal was
not to have 500 Startups,

00:47:22.070 --> 00:47:23.820
although that was the
name of the company.

00:47:23.820 --> 00:47:28.805
It was simply to
choose a lot of them.

00:47:28.805 --> 00:47:30.930
But I think a lot of our
philosophy about investing

00:47:30.930 --> 00:47:34.610
is basically that we are not
always great stock pickers.

00:47:34.610 --> 00:47:38.114
But if we have a larger
portfolio, we'll find success.

00:47:38.114 --> 00:47:38.780
AUDIENCE: I see.

00:47:38.780 --> 00:47:44.070
So my question is, is your
decision making improved over

00:47:44.070 --> 00:47:45.860
the years or not?

00:47:45.860 --> 00:47:48.570
DAVE MCCLURE: I have
no fucking idea.

00:47:48.570 --> 00:47:50.490
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Say yes.

00:47:50.490 --> 00:47:55.180
AUDIENCE: Is [INAUDIBLE] of
fund two better than fund one?

00:47:55.180 --> 00:47:55.930
DAVE MCCLURE: Yes.

00:47:55.930 --> 00:47:57.090
That is true.

00:47:57.090 --> 00:48:00.160
Probably by at least 500
basis points, I think.

00:48:00.160 --> 00:48:02.120
I'd say that one isn't bad.

00:48:02.120 --> 00:48:04.050
One's performed
pretty good, too.

00:48:04.050 --> 00:48:08.260
But I'm not investing in
all the companies anymore.

00:48:08.260 --> 00:48:11.240
We have about 20-- we have
75 people in the company.

00:48:11.240 --> 00:48:13.570
About 20 of those are
making investment decisions.

00:48:13.570 --> 00:48:17.160
And our goal is really to
scale the investing process

00:48:17.160 --> 00:48:21.740
so that many people are
making many decisions globally

00:48:21.740 --> 00:48:22.410
all the time.

00:48:22.410 --> 00:48:25.030
And 500 is actually a
relatively small number

00:48:25.030 --> 00:48:27.526
for what we're
eventually aiming for.

00:48:27.526 --> 00:48:31.890
I think there's-- strangely,
the venture capital industry,

00:48:31.890 --> 00:48:34.091
as much as it's all about
scale and technology,

00:48:34.091 --> 00:48:36.340
is pretty hypocritical and
hasn't done either of those

00:48:36.340 --> 00:48:38.360
things well itself.

00:48:38.360 --> 00:48:40.110
And the largest
VC funds right now

00:48:40.110 --> 00:48:42.660
probably aren't much
more than 100 people.

00:48:42.660 --> 00:48:45.030
Most of them are
far less than that.

00:48:45.030 --> 00:48:47.620
So scaling the
organization globally,

00:48:47.620 --> 00:48:50.890
and doing thousands, if not 10s
of thousands of investments,

00:48:50.890 --> 00:48:53.180
and eventually 100s of
thousands, or possibly

00:48:53.180 --> 00:48:55.070
millions, is our goal.

00:48:55.070 --> 00:48:56.700
That may sound fucking crazy.

00:48:56.700 --> 00:49:00.910
But I think building a startup
with 500 to 1,000 people

00:49:00.910 --> 00:49:05.110
seems sort of
pedestrian, almost small.

00:49:05.110 --> 00:49:07.300
To think of a VC fund that
has 500 to 1,000 people

00:49:07.300 --> 00:49:09.530
seems wacky.

00:49:09.530 --> 00:49:12.530
But there's a lot
of innovation left

00:49:12.530 --> 00:49:13.930
to do in the venture industry.

00:49:13.930 --> 00:49:16.200
AUDIENCE: I think
Benchmark has six, I think.

00:49:16.200 --> 00:49:17.050
DAVE MCCLURE: Yeah.

00:49:17.050 --> 00:49:18.010
They're so small.

00:49:18.010 --> 00:49:19.465
Gosh.

00:49:19.465 --> 00:49:20.430
Well, except in height.

00:49:20.430 --> 00:49:22.154
Bill's pretty tall.

00:49:22.154 --> 00:49:24.570
DANA HAN-KLEIN: I think we
have time for one more audience

00:49:24.570 --> 00:49:27.040
question.

00:49:27.040 --> 00:49:29.220
AUDIENCE: You talked a bit
about execution failures.

00:49:29.220 --> 00:49:30.320
What do those look like?

00:49:30.320 --> 00:49:31.760
Is that people running
out of stamina?

00:49:31.760 --> 00:49:32.880
DAVE MCCLURE: When we
fail to kill people.

00:49:32.880 --> 00:49:34.530
That's execution failure.

00:49:34.530 --> 00:49:35.452
[LAUGHTER]

00:49:37.300 --> 00:49:39.620
BRADY FORREST: I mean,
for a Highway1 team,

00:49:39.620 --> 00:49:42.890
it's often a poor technology
decision that they then

00:49:42.890 --> 00:49:46.160
just waste a lot of time on.

00:49:46.160 --> 00:49:50.409
Or wasting time on the
wrong person pitching, when

00:49:50.409 --> 00:49:52.200
that person's not
delivering, and they need

00:49:52.200 --> 00:49:53.780
someone else, or a bad hire.

00:49:53.780 --> 00:49:57.680
It's often a decision that
routes them and wastes

00:49:57.680 --> 00:49:59.237
their time.

00:49:59.237 --> 00:50:01.320
DAVE MCCLURE: There's just
a ton of different ways

00:50:01.320 --> 00:50:03.660
to fuck up a startup.

00:50:03.660 --> 00:50:06.840
And most of those involve
not delivering product

00:50:06.840 --> 00:50:10.360
for customers, but
there's also hiring fail.

00:50:10.360 --> 00:50:13.260
There's developing a product
that people love but you're not

00:50:13.260 --> 00:50:14.530
making enough money about.

00:50:14.530 --> 00:50:19.840
Or there's not being able to
scale that to larger audiences.

00:50:19.840 --> 00:50:23.090
So it's hard to sort of say
there's one or very specific

00:50:23.090 --> 00:50:23.590
things.

00:50:23.590 --> 00:50:27.320
There's just lots and
lots of different ways.

00:50:27.320 --> 00:50:30.930
BRADY FORREST: But
we inevitably--

00:50:30.930 --> 00:50:32.680
we just started this
next batch, but we'll

00:50:32.680 --> 00:50:36.010
have two or three founders
leave during the program.

00:50:36.010 --> 00:50:40.220
That's the most common fail case
that we see within the program.

00:50:42.890 --> 00:50:45.090
DANA HAN-KLEIN: On that
very positive note--

00:50:45.090 --> 00:50:46.390
BRADY FORREST: Sorry!

00:50:46.390 --> 00:50:48.800
DANA HAN-KLEIN: No, but
sometimes it's necessary.

00:50:48.800 --> 00:50:51.300
And if it's not right for you
guys, it's not right for them.

00:50:51.300 --> 00:50:53.140
Why continue on that path?

00:50:53.140 --> 00:50:55.390
But with that, thank you so
much for joining us today.

00:50:55.390 --> 00:50:57.190
And let's give a
round of applause.

00:50:57.190 --> 00:51:00.240
[APPLAUSE]
