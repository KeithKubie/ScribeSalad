00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:01.200
Thanks Nick.

00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:04.780
Here on this Android device we have an
activity with an element that we want to

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:07.490
change, namely this text field here.

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:11.030
So let's switch over to Android Studio
to see how we can do this in code.

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:16.810
In the project window here,
under this folder called values.

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:20.410
We have a file called styles.xml,

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:25.190
this holds the default theme for
this application called AppTheme.

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:29.330
As we can see, we have no customized
properties in our AppTheme.

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:31.710
As we can see from this parent property,

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:37.590
AppTheme derived from
Theme.AppCompat.Light.DarkActionBar.

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.090
Now, let's look at some of
the properties that make up

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:41.980
this DarkActionBar theme.

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:43.830
So there are a couple
of ways to do this.

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:47.970
So if we right-click and
go down to Go To, and

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:52.000
then Implementation or
you can Ctrl+Click.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.810
So we see the style right here.

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:57.330
The Theme.AppCompat.Light.DarkActionBar.

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:58.185
That derived from

00:00:58.185 --> 00:01:02.520
Base.Theme.AppCompat.Light
DarkActionBar.

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.340
So if we go to that one, we can see
there a couple of properties here.

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.070
Some of the interesting ones here
are the colorPrimaryDark and

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.770
the colorPrimary.

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:18.340
Now, you can go and see what those
colors are by doing another Ctrl+Click.

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:22.420
And we see right here that,
that corresponds to a black color.

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:26.880
So now,
that we're back in our styles.xml file,

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.010
let's create a new style.

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:33.200
So in this code right here,
we have a style called MyStyle

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.850
that assigned a greenish type
color to android:textColor.

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:43.170
So now, that we have our style,
let's assign it to an actual element.

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:49.250
So if we go back into our project view,
let's go to layout &gt; activity_main.

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:51.970
So here's the text view
that we previously had

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:54.480
that shows up as a grayish color.

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.520
Let's go in here.

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.597
So in these text views declaration,
we just need to add this last

00:02:01.597 --> 00:02:06.595
line here where we say the style
is equal to @style/MyStyle.

00:02:06.595 --> 00:02:10.508
And that's referring to the style that
we created before called, MyStyle.

00:02:10.508 --> 00:02:13.850
One thing that you notice is
the style property right here,

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:16.760
isn't appended with an android:.

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.500
So if we go over to the design view,
we can see this green color here for

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:21.240
Hello world!
