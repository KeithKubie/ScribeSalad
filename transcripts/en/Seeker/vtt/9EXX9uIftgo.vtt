00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.180
The robots are coming.

00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:02.029
We all know it.

00:00:02.029 --> 00:00:04.914
And yet here we are, marching
towards doom with smiles

00:00:04.914 --> 00:00:05.455
on our faces.

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:14.650
Hey, future extinct humans--
Trace here with some robot news

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:15.580
from Planet Earth.

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:17.770
Robots are stealing
our jobs, man.

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:20.810
We talked about this before,
but that was more abstract.

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:23.120
Now, with Amazon planning
to ship via drone,

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:25.820
Google is on the
robotic bandwagon, too.

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:28.480
The search giant acquired
seven robotics companies,

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.140
and put the man
who was previously

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.340
on top of the Android
operating system-- Andy

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.030
Rubin-- in charge.

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:35.594
Look at the self-driving car.

00:00:35.594 --> 00:00:38.010
Google took the human driver
out of the equation entirely,

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.135
and now they're thinking
of doing something similar

00:00:40.135 --> 00:00:42.770
with jobs like shipping,
grocery stock, manufacturing,

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:44.590
and other low skilled jobs.

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:46.830
Rubin believes robotics
have advanced enough

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:49.010
where we can build hands
and bodies pretty easily--

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:51.000
it's the software
and sensors that

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.350
need to have some breakthroughs.

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.910
Robots have already been
adopted in auto manufacturing

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:57.224
and military application--
and if Amazon has their way,

00:00:57.224 --> 00:00:59.390
drones will be shipping
packages before you know it.

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:02.040
For the moment, our grocery
jobs, retail positions,

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:05.019
and food service jobs might
be safe, but only just.

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:07.700
But if you're a security guard,
you're about to be under-bid.

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.570
The five foot tall, 300
pound K5 Autonomous Data

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.620
Machine is the first useful
robotic security guard.

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:16.160
We're not jumping to a
RoboCop dystopia quite yet.

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.150
But seriously-- a robot
that guards humans?

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.310
This little guy sort
of looks like R2-D2,

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.680
and is described as a 21st
century neighborhood watchman.

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:25.400
It can't attack,
but it can record

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.349
what's happening-- it
just kind of watches.

00:01:27.349 --> 00:01:29.140
As it's a work in
progress, they've not yet

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:31.880
added facial recognition or
other things it should probably

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.810
have to effectively police.

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.920
The K5 project was built
to protect schoolchildren

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:37.900
after the Sandy Hook
shootings, and it

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:39.820
does so for less
than minimum wage--

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:42.560
costing only about
$6.25 per hour.

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.565
Which begs the question-- do
robots deserve minimum wage?

00:01:45.565 --> 00:01:46.940
While you think
about that, there

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:48.356
are plenty of other
robots looking

00:01:48.356 --> 00:01:49.830
to take over lower
wage jobs, too.

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:52.280
Sex workers are legal in
some parts of the world.

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.430
And now a robot can--
you know-- perform

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:57.030
some handy tasks for you.

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.440
It was made in Japan-- and
paired with virtual reality,

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:04.100
it syncs with its
rhythm, and-- yeah.

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.200
For now, the only
major advantage

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.690
we have in this battle
is the old noodle.

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:10.770
Low education, repetitive
jobs are slowly

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.330
being taken over by robots.

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.820
And by slowly, I mean, like,
in the conceivable future.

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:17.040
Unlike some of the more
loosey-goosey projects

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.280
that Google tackles,
this robotics plan

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.100
is hoping to have breakthroughs
and make sales pretty soon.

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.560
They've got the will--
they've got the cash.

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.020
Let's just hope they build
in the three laws of robotics

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:29.950
alongside their slogan,
"Don't be evil."

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:30.930
What do you think?

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.860
Do you want robots to take
over some or all of these jobs?

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:37.081
Should we protect humans
from their cold metal grip?

00:02:37.081 --> 00:02:39.080
Let us know your thoughts
in the comments below.

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:40.950
And just so you know
it's not all bad,

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.120
some robots are making
mankind better--

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:44.640
like the ones that make beer.

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.400
Our friends over at
Brew Age got the scoop

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.720
on a San Francisco
brewery using robotic arms

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.020
to do their dirty work.

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:51.920
