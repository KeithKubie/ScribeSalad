00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
The next few problems we're going to be talking about shock absorbers

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
and shock absorbers help keep your car ride smooth even when the road is extra bumpy.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Now, for this problem let's imagine that each of the four wheels on a car each has a shock absorber,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
which we're going to model as a single spring with spring constant K.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
There are four wheels here, and each one is separated from the body of the car

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
with one of these springs with spring constant K.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.000
K is equal to 100,000 N/m and if the mass of the car is 2000 kg,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
can you tell me what's going to be the displacement Î”x,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
so how much are these springs going to compress away from their equilibrium position

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
when we put the mass of the car on those springs.

00:00:40.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Give your answer in centimeters here.
