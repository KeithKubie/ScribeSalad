1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:00.780
Time,

2
00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:04.260
but when you just did and it's going to get there and I can't fucking wait when

3
00:00:04.261 --> 00:00:07.680
he goes,
I am ready for heavyweight.
Hendrick's Francis,

4
00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.350
what are we going to do?
What are we going to do?
Kimber steep.

5
00:00:13.351 --> 00:00:14.670
A cane.

6
00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:18.570
Well they're probably Lesnar deal doesn't get done.

7
00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.840
The talk is steep a versus DC cause the Brock Lesnar deal is not done now in

8
00:00:25.141 --> 00:00:29.460
that whole process.
Cause Prost no that's not real.

9
00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.270
What WWE fuck he didn't know.
I thought it was real.
I'm sorry.

10
00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.320
Do you see game of Thrones?
I'll give you some more spoiled dude.

11
00:00:36.321 --> 00:00:40.150
I bet your sweet ass.
I don't talk about it.
People get angry.

12
00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:44.460
Now there are dragons,
DVR and dragons.

13
00:00:44.461 --> 00:00:46.050
A real um,

14
00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:50.760
they think that you see Steve Bay to rock might not fight.
They don't know.

15
00:00:50.761 --> 00:00:53.520
Like Brock has to decide this is something he definitely wants to do.

16
00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.530
Quit fucking given us blue balls and get the fuck in there.

17
00:00:56.531 --> 00:00:58.710
I get the fuck out now.
He's got to make the commitment.

18
00:00:58.711 --> 00:01:01.630
And I know he's been training,
he's been training and training.
Yeah.

19
00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:06.570
And he's trained with some high level wrestlers.
I Hoe Michigan's DC July.

20
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.220
What's up?
Yeah.
And then July content stack.

21
00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.050
You've got to be careful with Brock memory tag.

22
00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.840
Randy coture and dropped him and hammer fist at him into oblivion.

23
00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:18.210
He was 48 years old,
but I hear Ya.

24
00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:24.060
I hear Ya.
I like you're selling me on these flights.

25
00:01:24.061 --> 00:01:28.530
Never how he smashed Frank Mir.
Yes.
Terrifying.
That was remarried.

26
00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.340
Him and freight Caden each other and each fucked frank up.
Well,

27
00:01:32.341 --> 00:01:35.400
it's because frank got him with that knee bar and he didn't,
he uh,

28
00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.400
he tapped the referee didn't stop it to,

29
00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:40.700
it's a stupid miotic not blocked Brock Lesnar next and like,
oh,

30
00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.660
when did this happen?
Like the preconference maybe.
Oh Wow.
But he's,

31
00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.900
but that's just the headline.
He goes,
we don't know what Brooke's going to do,

32
00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.890
but if it doesn't happen,
it's steep bay.
Oh,
this just one of them.
They got us.

33
00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.240
They got you.
They got us better.
John Means am credit worked.

34
00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.700
If we could listen too click baity farmers,
they got us.

35
00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:03.940
I love Steve Bape steep ADC.
I'm like,
alright,
yeah,
yeah.

36
00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.210
I need something spicy,
man.
I,

37
00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:09.450
I get what you're saying and I get the Brock Lesnar appeal.

38
00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.240
I would rather see steep,
steep it,
you know,
like,

39
00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:13.860
cause you're a purist and that's why I like you,
but not me.

40
00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:18.360
I'm like depressed Hilton of MMA,
not me sir.
Out of respect,

41
00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.580
because I know he deserves it.
He Won.

42
00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.090
He defended the title more than any human being that's ever held it.

43
00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.610
He's the number one guy in the heavyweight division.

44
00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.790
So you have to rate him the greatest heavyweight of all time.

45
00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:34.080
If you look about accomplishments,
he's the greatest UFC heavyweight of all time.

46
00:02:34.081 --> 00:02:38.770
He sees in terms of accomplishments,
just because he's done it four times.
Okay.

47
00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.960
You know,
DC beat him.
Obviously DC is supposed to mean if you,

48
00:02:42.961 --> 00:02:45.960
if you had to rank him,
you know,
like right now,

49
00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:50.430
like one through 10 thank [inaudible] Frank Gcs,

50
00:02:50.431 --> 00:02:53.740
number one,
because he's the champion and knocked him out to say he's number two.

51
00:02:53.741 --> 00:02:56.430
It'd be silly,
but to say like the all time,
greatest,

52
00:02:56.431 --> 00:03:00.280
most accomplished heavyweight [inaudible] CTCs.
Okay.

53
00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.270
The all time most accomplished greatest heavyweight is DPA.

54
00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:06.760
You gotta count.
Well,

55
00:03:06.761 --> 00:03:11.080
Kane never defended as many times as steep paid did.
The question is,

56
00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:12.880
did Cain beat the better guys?

57
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.610
Did he beat junior dos Santos when junior was young?
He,

58
00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:19.030
before he had been through those wars with Kane.
Right.

59
00:03:19.031 --> 00:03:21.100
Because by the time Steve Bay got him,

60
00:03:21.101 --> 00:03:24.790
Jr had been in some wars in junior has like really good late.
He looks amazing.

61
00:03:24.791 --> 00:03:27.270
But you can never discount the,
that damage you can.

62
00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:31.210
I'm not saying that he's not as good now.
I think he's still phenomenal now.

63
00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:36.240
But the Bam Bam to Ivanka fight knocking out that [inaudible] toughest shit man

64
00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:39.760
knocking that motherfucker out.
And the way he did it,
he looks good man.

65
00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:43.780
Dude is as good as jds a Francis of ESPN code.

66
00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:45.010
That's not a paper view.

67
00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:50.470
I think that's fucking does ESPN I think so to a fucking can you do and do him

68
00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:55.400
around and um,
he fought Derrick Lewis,
right?
Yeah.
Stop Derrick Lewis.
Stop.

69
00:03:55.401 --> 00:03:59.620
They're close.
Yeah.
Look,
junior dos Santos still is an amazing fighter.

70
00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.510
That's something she'll like.
Ah,
ah.

71
00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:06.940
So I'm going to watch it when Steve a beat.
But you know what,

72
00:04:06.941 --> 00:04:10.150
Steve Bacon knock anybody out like that too.
It's hard to say.

73
00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:14.770
You know what the problem is with Steve Bay,
the prom is DC's fought what?

74
00:04:14.771 --> 00:04:17.440
Twice since their fight Steve.
But he's just been chilling.
Boy,

75
00:04:17.441 --> 00:04:20.290
he's been wanting this rematch.
Weight Guy.
Got It.
I get it.
But,

76
00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:23.530
but it's a risky thing when you're a former heavyweight champion and you're

77
00:04:23.531 --> 00:04:27.880
going to take a fight when you rightfully deserve a rematch.

78
00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:31.010
And what if you get hurt while you're taking this fight?
What have you,

79
00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:34.120
you know you have this fight and you get hurt and then you have knee surgery,

80
00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:37.060
then you're out for another year and then DC loses it in DC retires,

81
00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:40.720
he wants to fight him again and the way to fight him again is to hold out,

82
00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:44.350
hold out this whole time.
I don't know.
Obviously the UFC wants to fight DC again.

83
00:04:44.351 --> 00:04:47.840
That's the way it seems a little now in hindsight cause lesser.

84
00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:51.010
That happened in John Joseph not going a heavyweight but he's the third choice

85
00:04:51.011 --> 00:04:52.810
and all this.
Well I thought waiting for that.

86
00:04:52.811 --> 00:04:57.620
I thought it was very interested in,
is it John said that to Steve Bay that John,

87
00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:00.340
I don't think it's weird if which align thing.

88
00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:04.090
The same thing we do with style bender.
He's just fucking with everybody.

89
00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:05.380
He's getting his name out there.

90
00:05:05.381 --> 00:05:09.070
He's learning from Connor C I think there's more to it.

91
00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:11.140
I think UFC was fishing and went,
hey,

92
00:05:11.141 --> 00:05:14.270
you down in the fight steepen tenement y'all fuck ups depot and then what?
Steep.

93
00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:17.920
Identify Johnny when Y'all fuck up John?
I think there's more to it.
You think so?

94
00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:21.250
Yeah.
What makes you say that?
I don't know.
No reason at all.

95
00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:25.330
Maybe they did have some preliminary discussions as to whether or not the two

96
00:05:25.331 --> 00:05:29.860
would engage in fisticuffs.
Maybe they did.
That's a great fight.

97
00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:34.150
Great fight.
Stinks preserves it 100% he deserves big fights,
man.
Look,

98
00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:37.540
the guy doesn't deserve to be forgotten.
No,
not at all.

99
00:05:37.541 --> 00:05:42.541
But Francis in Gando fight was one of the most impressive heavyweight title

100
00:05:42.581 --> 00:05:45.820
defenses because Francis was on fire.

101
00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.390
He was so dangerous because they have Francis ranked ahead of him now.

102
00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:52.240
Just be disrespectful,
but Francis has done work.

103
00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:55.600
Steve Bay's got gotta be the number one contender.
Know what?

104
00:05:55.690 --> 00:06:00.200
B D Steve Bay's number one?
Yeah.
Come after Barry.
Have to be,

105
00:06:00.201 --> 00:06:04.970
you never know what's running half to be.
Have to be France.
Steeply.
Your Francis.

106
00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:08.960
Yeah.
For Steve Baby Francis.
It's that simple.
Steve may be junior.

107
00:06:08.961 --> 00:06:12.530
It's that simple.
Yeah.
I mean,
come on,
man.
Dude.

108
00:06:12.531 --> 00:06:16.430
Francis dos Santos.
Oh my God.
Dude.
