00:00:00.583 --> 00:00:01.486
- [Voiceover] Hey grammarians.

00:00:01.486 --> 00:00:03.352
Today we're gonna talk about three of

00:00:03.352 --> 00:00:05.774
the relative adverbs in English.

00:00:05.774 --> 00:00:07.982
Which is where, when, and why.

00:00:07.982 --> 00:00:11.565
And this over here is Peggy the dragon.

00:00:11.565 --> 00:00:13.916
And we're gonna use the story
of Peggy the dragon in order

00:00:13.916 --> 00:00:16.932
to figure out how to use
these relative adverbs.

00:00:16.932 --> 00:00:19.166
You may be looking at
these words and thinking

00:00:19.166 --> 00:00:22.093
that they look an awful
lot like question words.

00:00:22.093 --> 00:00:23.754
And you're right they are.

00:00:23.754 --> 00:00:25.907
These are questions words.

00:00:25.907 --> 00:00:26.996
But you can also--

00:00:26.996 --> 00:00:29.198
so you can use them to
ask a question like,

00:00:29.198 --> 00:00:30.781
where are you from?

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:33.337
Because we use the word,

00:00:33.337 --> 00:00:36.642
where to figure out
where stuff is in space.

00:00:36.642 --> 00:00:40.259
So you know, where figures out place.

00:00:40.259 --> 00:00:41.601
So Peggy could respond and say

00:00:41.601 --> 00:00:44.351
that is the cave where I grew up.

00:00:45.295 --> 00:00:46.731
And you can see that where,

00:00:46.731 --> 00:00:49.273
here is not being used in a question way.

00:00:49.273 --> 00:00:51.521
It's actually connecting

00:00:51.521 --> 00:00:53.271
the clause I grew up,

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.013
to cave.

00:00:56.439 --> 00:00:59.936
And this is why we call
this a relative adverb.

00:00:59.936 --> 00:01:03.725
Because the word, where,
modifies the word grew.

00:01:03.725 --> 00:01:05.231
It's I grew up, where.

00:01:05.231 --> 00:01:09.619
And it also connects
this whole thing to cave.

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:11.571
Because where did peggy grow up?

00:01:11.571 --> 00:01:12.596
A cave.

00:01:12.596 --> 00:01:14.762
And it connects this whole chunk

00:01:14.762 --> 00:01:17.420
to the rest of the sentence.

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:20.095
To the sentence being, that is the cave.

00:01:20.095 --> 00:01:24.262
We use the word, when, to
ask questions about time.

00:01:25.117 --> 00:01:27.299
So if I ask Peggy you
know, you're a dragon

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.216
when did you learn to breathe fire?

00:01:31.245 --> 00:01:32.879
Because all dragons can breathe fire

00:01:32.879 --> 00:01:34.181
(whooshing)

00:01:34.181 --> 00:01:35.348
She would say,

00:01:36.866 --> 00:01:41.033
I learned to breathe fire
when I was 10 years old.

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:43.812
So again we're using this word, when,

00:01:43.812 --> 00:01:46.062
to connect these two ideas.

00:01:47.534 --> 00:01:48.949
When did she learn to breathe fire?

00:01:48.949 --> 00:01:51.550
When she was 10 years old.

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:55.717
And technically, when is an
adverb that modifies was.

00:01:58.195 --> 00:02:00.314
Finally, we use the word why

00:02:00.314 --> 00:02:03.481
to figure out reasons for doing stuff.

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.597
So if something strange were happening

00:02:07.597 --> 00:02:11.597
in the countryside and I
asked Peggy, oh mighty dragon

00:02:11.597 --> 00:02:14.514
do you know why it is raining fish?

00:02:15.761 --> 00:02:17.094
Peggy could say,

00:02:18.007 --> 00:02:20.840
I don't know why that's happening.

00:02:22.978 --> 00:02:24.804
So again we've go these two clauses

00:02:24.804 --> 00:02:26.829
that is happening, and I don't know.

00:02:26.829 --> 00:02:29.829
And, why, connects and relates them.

00:02:32.084 --> 00:02:35.334
And why is modifying is happening here.

00:02:36.646 --> 00:02:39.393
And there are other relative adverbs like

00:02:39.393 --> 00:02:42.422
while, is another way to say when.

00:02:42.422 --> 00:02:46.391
And whence, which is
archaic and nobody really

00:02:46.391 --> 00:02:49.664
uses it but it's another way to say where.

00:02:49.664 --> 00:02:51.977
And if you're familiar
with Romeo and Juliet

00:02:51.977 --> 00:02:53.875
from Shakespeare, you've probably

00:02:53.875 --> 00:02:55.958
heard the word wherefore.

00:02:57.273 --> 00:02:58.132
You know as in,

00:02:58.132 --> 00:03:00.300
"Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo?

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.117
Deny thy father refuse thy name."

00:03:02.117 --> 00:03:02.950
Etcetera.

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:05.650
And that's an old fashioned
way of saying why.

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:07.276
So we don't really say wherefore anymore.

00:03:07.276 --> 00:03:09.384
We don't really say whence anymore.

00:03:09.384 --> 00:03:11.785
But while, is another way to say when.

00:03:11.785 --> 00:03:13.303
Where, you ask about place.

00:03:13.303 --> 00:03:14.616
When, you ask about time.

00:03:14.616 --> 00:03:16.730
Why, is for reasons.

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:20.124
These are the relative adverbs of English.

00:03:20.124 --> 00:03:21.106
You can learn anything.

00:03:21.106 --> 00:03:21.939
David out.
