00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Once again generalize.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
This time I want to go back to the bridge problem and generalize that.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
What we're going to come up with is lower&lt;u&gt;cost&lt;u&gt;search,&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
and that'll take some arguments and again return a path, but let's figure out what we need.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Yes, we're going to need the start state just like before.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
We're going to need a successor function, and we're going to need a goal function.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
In addition, we're going to need one more thing.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
We're going to need to know the cost of an action.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
That's going to be necessary. It's going to have to be a parameter to the function.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:41.000
We'll have the start, the successors, the goal, and the action cost and return from that a path.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
There's a notion of action&lt;u&gt;cost, and as part of our inventory of concepts,&lt;/u&gt;

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.000
there's also the notion of path cost, but that won't have to be passed in as a prohibitor.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Let's see if you can define for me lowest&lt;u&gt;cost&lt;u&gt;search,&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
which takes these four parameters and should perform the same type of search

00:00:59.000 --> 99:59:59.000
as we saw previously with the bridge problem.
