00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:07.960
- Good afternoon, and welcome
to the Radcliffe Institute

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:09.280
for Advanced Study.

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:11.560
My name is Janet Rich-Edwards.

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:14.120
I am one of the advisors
to the academic Ventures

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:15.880
Program, which
brings you programs

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:17.620
like this here at Radcliffe.

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:20.020
And I also happen to
be an epidemiologist.

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:22.120
This has been a
banner year for me,

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:26.980
because we have been able to
put on a series of lectures

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:28.780
about epidemiology.

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:31.900
This one, I'm glad you're here,
is the penultimate lecture.

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:35.830
We have one more on April 23
about Alzheimer's disease.

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:38.530
But I am absolutely
thrilled to welcome

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:41.230
the team of Cody Stanford
to give a talk today

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:44.560
about obesity, which is
arguably one of the greatest

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:48.040
public health challenges
we face in our lifetime.

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.530
She's an instructor of
medicine and pediatrics

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:52.270
at Harvard Medical School.

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:54.610
A leading expert on
obesity, Dr. Stanford

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:57.730
provides clinical care,
supervises trainees,

00:00:57.730 --> 00:00:59.710
administers a
clinic, and conducts

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:03.160
research on obesity, health
policy, and health disparities

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.050
to enhance knowledge
and quality of care.

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:08.260
In addition to teaching in
clinical work at Harvard,

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.800
and in the Massachusetts
MGH Weight Center,

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.810
she conducts clinical
research to evaluate

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:17.080
the efficacy of weight
loss medications

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.210
as an adjunct to
weight loss surgery,

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:22.360
delineate the metabolic changes
associated with adolescents who

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.510
undergo weight loss surgery,
and evaluate obesity treatment

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:27.760
coverage in the United States.

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:31.580
She's been featured in national
news, broadcasts, magazines,

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:34.510
newspapers, web sites on
issues related to obesity.

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:38.560
And I just learned that she
won the medical community's

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.930
equivalent of the Oscars.

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:42.500
It's called the Doxey Award.

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.100
It's a great golden statuette.

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.616
Just, I think, like, last week.

00:01:46.616 --> 00:01:49.460
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:53.150
In addition to all that, and
this long string of letters

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.820
you see after her name, she's
a recipient of the Harvard

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.550
Medical School Diversity Award,
and the Massachusetts Medical

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:00.620
Society's Women's Health Award.

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:04.220
She received her master's
in public health from Emory,

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:05.660
her M.D. From the
medical college

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:07.940
of Georgia School of
Medicine, and her master's

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:10.310
in public administration
from the Kennedy School.

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.106
Please welcome Dr.
Fatima Cody Stanford.

00:02:13.106 --> 00:02:15.010
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:20.179 --> 00:02:21.220
- Good evening, everyone.

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:22.360
Can you hear me?

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:23.410
OK, good evening.

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:25.600
I'm a walker and a
talker, so you'll

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.410
see me walk throughout the
course of this lecture.

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.640
Today, you're here to
learn about obesity.

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.410
And I hope that by the
end of this lecture,

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:36.580
you'll leave with some new
insights about obesity,

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:39.670
and its role in our
current structure

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:43.239
as it relates to health,
and multiple of issues.

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:45.280
I'm not going to spend
time talking about myself.

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.480
Thank you, Dr. Rich-Edwards.

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:48.730
So we will pass by that.

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:51.520
So what are the questions
of interest today?

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:53.530
What is obesity, and
what is its prevalence

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:55.930
in the United States,
and throughout the world?

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:57.650
We'll learn about
the epidemiology.

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:00.370
So we'll talk about
that initially.

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:01.930
Is obesity really complex?

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:03.670
You think it may be not complex.

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:05.680
Like, we are here to
understand why that is.

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.530
And if it is really complex,
how do we understand it?

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:11.830
How do we glean information?

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:14.530
How prevalent is weight
bias, and how do we

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:16.870
work to change it?

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:18.550
And what are some
clinical interventions

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:20.600
for the treatment of obesity?

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.360
Now I'm going to step
on a soapbox moment

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:23.901
at the very beginning
of this lecture

00:03:23.901 --> 00:03:27.190
to talk about our language
regarding obesity here

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:28.780
in the United States.

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:31.360
Often, we will refer to
patients as obese patient.

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:34.090
We use words such as
morbid obesity, fat.

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:35.800
I want us to change
that thinking

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:39.190
because that thinking, our
language in and of itself,

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:41.600
promotes weight bias and stigma.

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.020
So this is a disease
process like any other.

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:47.560
We talk about these as
patients with obesity,

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.260
patients with severe obesity.

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.410
We take out the term morbid,
because we don't utilize it

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:57.520
for any other disease process
i.e. cancer, heart disease,

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:59.620
things that could
potentially kill patients.

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:01.090
And so let's remove that.

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:03.137
You'll hear me talk with
people first, language,

00:04:03.137 --> 00:04:04.720
throughout the course
of this lecture,

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:08.410
and I challenge you to do
the same in your daily life.

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:11.040
Now let's look at obesity
and its prevalence

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.300
compared to other
disease processes.

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:16.540
We'll start with commonly
discussed disease processes.

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:19.220
HIV at the bottom of this list.

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:20.829
We have 1.2 million people.

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:23.590
We have colon cancer
here with 1.2 million.

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:26.680
Breast cancer gets a lot
of attention, 2.8 million.

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:29.890
All cancers combined,
13.8 million.

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:32.500
Diabetes 37.2 million.

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:35.440
NAFLD is nonalcoholic
fatty liver disease.

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:37.420
You can see 80.3 million.

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:40.850
And then obesity, 93.4 million.

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:43.390
Let's go look at how many people
own a TV here in the United

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:43.889
States.

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:45.670
115.6 million.

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:47.000
People that own a smartphone.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.875
We spend a lot more time
on our smartphones--

00:04:48.875 --> 00:04:50.480
205.4 million.

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:54.730
So what you can see here is
that 93 million adults struggle

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:56.980
with obesity.

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:02.660
Approximately 40% of the US
adult population has obesity.

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:04.700
But why are we not
doing much about it?

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:07.460
I think a lot of that has to do
with our lack of understanding,

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:12.140
and a lot of are placing blame
on patients, which we can hope

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:14.750
to change after this lecture.

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:17.300
Now when we look at
obesity, often, we

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:20.090
will look at it in terms of the
BMI, or the body mass index.

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:22.790
It determines height and
weight, and then gives us

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:25.100
a kind of a measure,
crude measure,

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:27.740
to help determine
who has obesity.

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:30.440
We'll look at the guidelines
for children and adults

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:31.979
that have obesity.

00:05:31.979 --> 00:05:33.270
There are different guidelines.

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:35.960
So if you're thinking about
your child or grandchild,

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:38.970
I want you to realize that
there are different criteria.

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:42.186
We'll start looking at
the pediatric population.

00:05:42.186 --> 00:05:44.435
So how is obesity defined
in children and adolescents.

00:05:44.435 --> 00:05:47.870
It's done based upon growth
measurements taken from the age

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:50.420
of 2 up until the age of 20.

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:52.520
So those that are
underweight have less

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:54.060
than the fifth percentile.

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:56.060
Those that are considered
to be a healthy weight

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:59.210
between the fifth and less
than the 85th percentiles.

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:00.890
Those that are
considered overweight,

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:03.950
between the 85th and less
than the 95th percentile.

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:06.410
And those that have
obesity greater

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:08.730
than or equal to
the 95th percentile.

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:11.450
Now there are criteria that
go beyond this, meaning

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:13.010
as we get into severe obesity.

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:16.400
I'm not going to specifically
focus on that here with regard

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:18.960
to the children and
adolescent population.

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:21.202
However, I won't
do that for adults.

00:06:21.202 --> 00:06:22.910
Now when we look at
adults, because we've

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:25.190
stopped growing
vertically, we actually

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:28.515
have just a BMI criteria
that defines adults.

00:06:28.515 --> 00:06:30.890
And this is utilized, not only
here in the United States,

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:32.510
but by the World
Health Organization

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:34.455
throughout the world.

00:06:34.455 --> 00:06:36.830
So when we look at those that
are considered underweight,

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:39.670
they have a BMI
of less than 18.5.

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:41.045
And for those that
are considered

00:06:41.045 --> 00:06:45.590
of normal or healthy weight,
a BMI from 18.5 to 24.9,

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:47.120
we start to get
into overweight when

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:50.210
we get to BMIs from 25 to 29.9.

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:51.854
And then we get into obesity.

00:06:51.854 --> 00:06:53.270
And what you can
see on the screen

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:56.900
is we have class 1, class
2, and class 3 obesity--

00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:59.540
mild, moderate,
and severe obesity.

00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:03.260
Mild obesity being classified
as a BMI of 30 to 34.9.

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:08.390
Class 2 obesity classified
as a BMI of 35 to 39.9.

00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:11.270
And then those that
have BMI and excess

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:16.980
or equal to 40 being categorized
as having severe obesity.

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:19.310
Now what I'm going to do is
just take you very briefly

00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:21.590
through some of
the epidemiology,

00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:23.630
starting very recently, 2011.

00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:26.510
Often, when I use the slides,
I'll start back from 1980,

00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:28.100
and bring us up to now.

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:30.170
But we all know that
obesity rates are climbing,

00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:31.350
that's part of why you're here.

00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:33.600
So I didn't want to really
kind of belabor that point.

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:36.050
But I do want to point
out some nuances here.

00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:40.550
So if you look at this graphic
here of the United States,

00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:44.900
this is looking at obesity
amongst US adults by state.

00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:47.240
I want to point out kind
of some key things in terms

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:50.090
of the coloring
here on the graph.

00:07:50.090 --> 00:07:53.390
States that have less than
20% obesity rates, if you

00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:56.300
can find one, let me know
about it, but no one does.

00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:59.090
Colorado was the
last to hang onto it.

00:07:59.090 --> 00:08:01.670
20% to 25% in green--

00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:03.920
so this is the percent
of the population.

00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:07.072
In yellow, 25% to less than 30%.

00:08:07.072 --> 00:08:08.780
In the orange, which
is just concentrated

00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:12.050
a lot here in the southeast
and in the Midwest, 30%

00:08:12.050 --> 00:08:13.550
to less than 35%.

00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:17.360
And then greater than or
equal to 35% obesity rates.

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:19.682
Now I want to give you a
little bit more information--

00:08:19.682 --> 00:08:21.140
and this is for
the epidemiologists

00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:23.348
in the room-- this is from
the Behavioral Risk Factor

00:08:23.348 --> 00:08:26.480
Surveillance System,
which is self-report data.

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:31.640
And so that means that this
is probably not even accurate.

00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:34.640
I just want you to think back to
your driver's license, and what

00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:37.309
weight you put on there, and
what weight you actually are,

00:08:37.309 --> 00:08:39.200
and you tell me
if those coincide.

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:41.720
Now if they coincide, and
you're actually accurate,

00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:42.330
that's great.

00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:45.140
But most people, fudge
the things a little bit.

00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:48.050
So what you can see
here-- this was 2011.

00:08:48.050 --> 00:08:50.540
Now in 2012, we
see a pretty shift.

00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:52.580
You're like, wow, in
one year we shifted?

00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:54.230
2013.

00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:55.760
2014.

00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:57.350
2015.

00:08:57.350 --> 00:08:58.040
OK?

00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:00.110
So we see a change,
and you guys you

00:09:00.110 --> 00:09:02.570
would agree with me that
there is a bit more orange.

00:09:02.570 --> 00:09:04.836
Some red has kind have
crept into the area.

00:09:04.836 --> 00:09:06.710
We start seeing some of
the southern states--

00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:09.770
Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana,
and then West Virginia

00:09:09.770 --> 00:09:12.290
getting obesity rates
by self-report data

00:09:12.290 --> 00:09:14.840
in excess of 35%.

00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:16.760
We see Guam here
on the outlying,

00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:18.300
and we see some differences.

00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:20.510
So of course, everyone's
looking up to Massachusetts.

00:09:20.510 --> 00:09:23.840
And we like to tout ourselves
on the back-- we're 20% to 25%.

00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:24.920
But really?

00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:29.000
Still 20% to 25% of the
population with obesity

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:30.230
by self-report?

00:09:30.230 --> 00:09:32.760
I mean, do we really need to
pat ourselves on the back?

00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:34.997
I don't know if we
should really get a pass.

00:09:34.997 --> 00:09:36.830
Now what I'm going to
do is I'm like to look

00:09:36.830 --> 00:09:39.830
at this by race and
ethnicity-- by the three

00:09:39.830 --> 00:09:42.180
major racial ethnic groups
here in the United States.

00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:44.180
We'll start looking
at white adults,

00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:45.890
we'll go into looking
at Hispanic adults,

00:09:45.890 --> 00:09:47.556
and we'll finish
looking at black adults

00:09:47.556 --> 00:09:49.600
here in the United States
by self-report data--

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:50.870
remember that.

00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:55.310
So if we look here, you can see
that there is some distribution

00:09:55.310 --> 00:09:59.350
of obesity in West Virginia.

00:09:59.350 --> 00:10:01.120
And we have Puerto Rico here.

00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:04.060
For those that are white adults
here in the United States,

00:10:04.060 --> 00:10:06.250
Colorado does have
that less than 20%,

00:10:06.250 --> 00:10:08.620
specifically for white adults.

00:10:08.620 --> 00:10:12.550
DC, so the District of
Columbia, and Hawaii.

00:10:12.550 --> 00:10:14.380
I wanted to say Hawaii.

00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:15.820
So less than 20%.

00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:16.870
OK?

00:10:16.870 --> 00:10:19.420
Let's look at what happens
when we look at Hispanic adults

00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:21.040
here in the United States.

00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:23.710
We do see an oranging,
a reddening of the map.

00:10:23.710 --> 00:10:25.360
Would you guys agree with that?

00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:28.600
So we start seeing a
lot more red distributed

00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:31.270
throughout the United States.

00:10:31.270 --> 00:10:33.880
I think that the graphic
that's most concerning

00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:37.040
is this last one, which is
black adults here in the United

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:37.540
States.

00:10:37.540 --> 00:10:39.580
This is a lot of what
brought me to this work.

00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:41.413
I mean, you guys probably
recognize that I'm

00:10:41.413 --> 00:10:42.800
an African-American woman.

00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:45.610
And so I was always
concerned at why was there

00:10:45.610 --> 00:10:46.780
such a huge disparity.

00:10:46.780 --> 00:10:50.920
You can see that most of
this map is red in nature.

00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:53.590
And while red is a lovely
color, in this situation,

00:10:53.590 --> 00:10:56.470
it's not one that precludes
positive thoughts.

00:10:56.470 --> 00:10:58.180
And so part of my
work on disparities

00:10:58.180 --> 00:11:00.400
is really to address
and understand

00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:03.220
why there's such a difference
in the prevalence of obesity

00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:06.400
by race and ethnicity
here in the United States.

00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:08.050
Now a lot of people
often say to me

00:11:08.050 --> 00:11:10.270
that this is just a US problem.

00:11:10.270 --> 00:11:12.290
When I go other places
around the world,

00:11:12.290 --> 00:11:13.540
I don't really notice obesity.

00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:15.880
And I would challenge your
thinking on this notion.

00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:20.200
Greater than 10% of the
world's population has obesity.

00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:22.729
So that means it is
pandemic in nature.

00:11:22.729 --> 00:11:25.270
And I want to focus on some of
the areas that might have been

00:11:25.270 --> 00:11:26.240
a little bit shocking to you.

00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:27.850
Obviously, we have
the United States.

00:11:27.850 --> 00:11:29.410
We have Alaska.

00:11:29.410 --> 00:11:30.230
We have Egypt.

00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:33.910
We have Libya, we have Saudi
Arabia, Iraq, and Turkey.

00:11:33.910 --> 00:11:36.400
Out here in New
Zealand, excess of 30%

00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:38.950
prevalence of obesity
in those countries.

00:11:38.950 --> 00:11:41.980
Those dark green colors
if we get to Australia.

00:11:41.980 --> 00:11:43.930
Lots of Europe.

00:11:43.930 --> 00:11:45.910
We would see a lot
of places still

00:11:45.910 --> 00:11:48.190
have pretty significant
obesity rates.

00:11:48.190 --> 00:11:49.559
I mean, here in Africa--

00:11:49.559 --> 00:11:51.100
so it's interesting--
so we just talk

00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:52.570
about black adults
in the US have

00:11:52.570 --> 00:11:53.810
really severe obesity rates.

00:11:53.810 --> 00:11:56.800
But throughout much of Africa,
the prevalence of obesity

00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:57.950
is less than 10%.

00:11:57.950 --> 00:11:59.530
So there are some
things that might

00:11:59.530 --> 00:12:01.750
account for these nuances.

00:12:01.750 --> 00:12:03.970
So when we talk
about energy balance,

00:12:03.970 --> 00:12:07.240
we learned that energy
balance is very simple.

00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:09.200
Really, what are we
having this talk for?

00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:11.710
It's really just about calories
in-- the food and beverages

00:12:11.710 --> 00:12:13.420
that we eat--

00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:15.970
versus our bodily
functions, stool output,

00:12:15.970 --> 00:12:17.330
physical activity.

00:12:17.330 --> 00:12:19.720
And if we just get
this in balance,

00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:24.060
then we should all be lean, OK?

00:12:24.060 --> 00:12:26.700
But that's not the
simplicity that

00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:30.030
makes this disease process
as prevalent as it is,

00:12:30.030 --> 00:12:32.590
not only here in the United
States, but around the world.

00:12:32.590 --> 00:12:35.730
We'll learn why this
indeed, is incorrect,

00:12:35.730 --> 00:12:37.890
and why our focus
on this has led

00:12:37.890 --> 00:12:41.140
to this rise in obesity rate.

00:12:41.140 --> 00:12:42.760
So let's get obesity.

00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:46.350
It's a multi-factorial disorder
where genetics, environment,

00:12:46.350 --> 00:12:50.100
development, and behavior
all play a role in a person's

00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:53.509
likelihood of having obesity.

00:12:53.509 --> 00:12:55.550
Now I'm going to get into
the complexity of this,

00:12:55.550 --> 00:12:57.230
and hopefully, you guys don't
lose me, but don't worry,

00:12:57.230 --> 00:12:59.646
I'll bring it back to eighth
grade level in a few minutes.

00:12:59.646 --> 00:13:02.210
But we're going to go to
PhD level for just a moment

00:13:02.210 --> 00:13:05.970
so that we can understand
the complexity of obesity.

00:13:05.970 --> 00:13:11.444
Now what do you regulate the
weight set point is the brain.

00:13:11.444 --> 00:13:13.610
So if we're going to focus
on the part of the brain,

00:13:13.610 --> 00:13:15.920
we're going to focus
here on the hypothalamus.

00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:20.480
The hypothalamus is getting
signals from leptin out here

00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:21.230
in the fat tissue.

00:13:21.230 --> 00:13:25.040
It's getting signals from the
small intestine, the large,

00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:28.610
intestine the pancreas,
and the stomach.

00:13:28.610 --> 00:13:32.320
These are sending signals back
to the brain, and it tells you,

00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:35.900
it tells me, it tells my
patients not only how much

00:13:35.900 --> 00:13:39.890
to eat, but how much to store.

00:13:39.890 --> 00:13:42.070
So let's look at the
substances that you

00:13:42.070 --> 00:13:44.860
saw that were hormones--
where they're produced,

00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:47.680
and what their
effect on feeding is.

00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:50.050
We'll look at ghrelin,
which is housed

00:13:50.050 --> 00:13:52.300
in part of the stomach,
the fundus of the stomach,

00:13:52.300 --> 00:13:54.940
and in the hypothalamus,
which I just pointed out.

00:13:54.940 --> 00:13:58.390
Its effect on feeding
is orexigenic.

00:13:58.390 --> 00:14:00.910
So orexigenic means it
promotes my appetite,

00:14:00.910 --> 00:14:04.930
it stimulates my appetite,
it's what makes me hungry, OK?

00:14:04.930 --> 00:14:08.620
Anandamides, which are housed
in the small intestine--

00:14:08.620 --> 00:14:13.120
it is also an orexigenic or
appetite promoting hormone

00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:14.424
within the body.

00:14:14.424 --> 00:14:16.090
Now insulin, when we
talk about insulin,

00:14:16.090 --> 00:14:17.714
we're talking about
endogenous insulin,

00:14:17.714 --> 00:14:19.750
meaning insulin inside
of the body, not insulin

00:14:19.750 --> 00:14:22.400
that we're ministering
from external.

00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:25.150
And insulin is housed
in the pancreas.

00:14:25.150 --> 00:14:27.190
And it promotes satiety.

00:14:27.190 --> 00:14:32.070
It is anorexigenic. eugenics
So orexigenic, anorexigenic.

00:14:32.070 --> 00:14:34.270
Anorexigenic is the
opposite of orexigenic.

00:14:34.270 --> 00:14:38.247
So insulin inside of the
body promotes satiety, OK?

00:14:38.247 --> 00:14:40.330
Leptin, which is a hormone
you've likely heard of,

00:14:40.330 --> 00:14:43.851
in the Latin, it's
leptos, which means thin.

00:14:43.851 --> 00:14:45.850
It is produced in the
short term in the stomach,

00:14:45.850 --> 00:14:49.390
and the long term in the
adipocytes or fat cells.

00:14:49.390 --> 00:14:53.590
And it is also anorexigenic
and promotes satiety,

00:14:53.590 --> 00:14:55.570
that feeling of fullness.

00:14:55.570 --> 00:14:57.910
CCK or cholecystokinin
is produced

00:14:57.910 --> 00:14:59.770
in the small intestine.

00:14:59.770 --> 00:15:01.400
It promotes early satiety.

00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:03.520
So you get full quicker.

00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:07.570
And also, it plays a role
in digestive enzymes,

00:15:07.570 --> 00:15:10.210
and release of acid
in the stomach.

00:15:10.210 --> 00:15:12.640
Finally, we have
peptide YY, which

00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:15.580
is produced in the last part of
the small intestine, the ileum,

00:15:15.580 --> 00:15:17.650
and the colon, which
is the large intestine.

00:15:17.650 --> 00:15:21.520
And it promotes satiety,
so it is also anorexigenic.

00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:23.257
Now this looks crazy,
but don't worry,

00:15:23.257 --> 00:15:24.840
I'm going to take
you guys through it.

00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:29.050
I want you to guys think of this
as two lanes down the highway

00:15:29.050 --> 00:15:29.810
that we'll travel.

00:15:29.810 --> 00:15:32.380
We're going to focus on leptin,
which is a hormone here.

00:15:32.380 --> 00:15:34.262
And it's going to
bind to this receptor.

00:15:34.262 --> 00:15:36.220
So this is going to be
lane one of the highway,

00:15:36.220 --> 00:15:37.636
and then you can
go down lane two.

00:15:37.636 --> 00:15:39.770
But we'll focus on the
right part of this.

00:15:39.770 --> 00:15:42.490
So when leptin binds
to this receptor,

00:15:42.490 --> 00:15:44.470
it stimulates the
neuron in the brain

00:15:44.470 --> 00:15:48.070
called the POMC or the
proopiomelanocortin neuron

00:15:48.070 --> 00:15:49.000
in the brain.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.510
This is in the arcuate
nucleus of the hypothalamus.

00:15:52.510 --> 00:15:55.210
Now when we promote this, think
of this as a firing mechanism.

00:15:55.210 --> 00:15:57.130
It fires, and it
communicates information

00:15:57.130 --> 00:15:59.690
about what I'm supposed to do.

00:15:59.690 --> 00:16:02.990
So people that travele down this
lane of the brain or this lane

00:16:02.990 --> 00:16:06.700
down the highway, they
get an anorexigenic signal

00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:07.660
to their brain.

00:16:07.660 --> 00:16:11.530
They have high levels of what's
called BDNF, which is brain

00:16:11.530 --> 00:16:13.450
derived neurotrophic factor.

00:16:13.450 --> 00:16:16.540
And for these people that travel
down this lane or this pathway

00:16:16.540 --> 00:16:19.620
in the brain, they
tend to be very lean.

00:16:19.620 --> 00:16:21.484
I often like to
bring up my husband.

00:16:21.484 --> 00:16:22.900
At this time of
lecture, he's used

00:16:22.900 --> 00:16:26.740
to hearing me bring him up
because his brain signals

00:16:26.740 --> 00:16:29.260
perfectly down this pathway, OK?

00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:33.970
So he's been with me it will
24 years next week, sorry

00:16:33.970 --> 00:16:36.550
and he can eat what
he would like to eat,

00:16:36.550 --> 00:16:38.530
he can work out as
much as he would like,

00:16:38.530 --> 00:16:40.010
and he is very, very lean.

00:16:40.010 --> 00:16:42.790
So at six feet tall,
and about 150 pounds,

00:16:42.790 --> 00:16:44.369
he stands, which is great.

00:16:44.369 --> 00:16:46.160
He's also standing in
the back of the room.

00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:47.890
He doesn't think
I know he came in.

00:16:47.890 --> 00:16:49.127
All right.

00:16:49.127 --> 00:16:49.960
He was late, though.

00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:50.830
[INAUDIBLE]

00:16:50.830 --> 00:16:51.956
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:51.956 --> 00:16:54.539
So leptin can bind to
this alternate receptor.

00:16:54.539 --> 00:16:56.080
It looks like it's
the same receptor,

00:16:56.080 --> 00:16:58.600
but it stimulates a different
neuron in the brain.

00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:00.970
This is called Agouti-related
peptide neuron,

00:17:00.970 --> 00:17:03.800
and it's specifically housed
here in the paraventricular

00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:05.890
nucleus of the hypothalamus.

00:17:05.890 --> 00:17:09.430
For these people, they
get low levels of BDNF.

00:17:09.430 --> 00:17:12.670
So low levels of brain
derived neurotrophic factor.

00:17:12.670 --> 00:17:16.329
And these patients will
often struggle with obesity.

00:17:16.329 --> 00:17:18.910
If you're a person or
a person that gosh,

00:17:18.910 --> 00:17:20.504
they seem to be
eating very healthy,

00:17:20.504 --> 00:17:22.170
they seem to be
exercising all the time,

00:17:22.170 --> 00:17:26.010
but no matter what they do,
they seem to defend a higher set

00:17:26.010 --> 00:17:29.110
point, it's a high likelihood
that they have a predilection

00:17:29.110 --> 00:17:31.810
to firing down this
pathway of the brain.

00:17:31.810 --> 00:17:32.860
And it's unfair.

00:17:32.860 --> 00:17:34.690
We want to do with
my husband's doing--

00:17:34.690 --> 00:17:36.940
I want that little bit
of that sometimes too--

00:17:36.940 --> 00:17:39.130
but it's not what
the reality is.

00:17:39.130 --> 00:17:42.140
So then we have to figure out
how do we affect the pathway,

00:17:42.140 --> 00:17:45.160
the signaling to
change such that we

00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:48.130
can have an impact on
someone's likelihood

00:17:48.130 --> 00:17:50.770
to go down this
preferential pathway as it

00:17:50.770 --> 00:17:53.260
relates to weight regulation.

00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:54.580
So let's look at BDNF.

00:17:54.580 --> 00:17:57.460
We talked about brain derived
neurotropic factor regulation

00:17:57.460 --> 00:18:00.311
and obesity, talking
about the role it plays.

00:18:00.311 --> 00:18:01.810
And so what they
did was they looked

00:18:01.810 --> 00:18:05.560
at about 30,000 individuals,
and they tried to determine,

00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:06.405
what's going on.

00:18:06.405 --> 00:18:08.530
What are we seeing, and
how does that differ, maybe

00:18:08.530 --> 00:18:10.360
by race and ethnicity?

00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:13.900
What they found were
that people with obesity

00:18:13.900 --> 00:18:17.890
had a CC pair of this
heterogeneous nucleotide,

00:18:17.890 --> 00:18:19.630
ribonuclear protein D0B--

00:18:19.630 --> 00:18:21.740
I'll ask you guys
about that later--

00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:23.720
CC pair.

00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:26.380
And for those people
that have this pair,

00:18:26.380 --> 00:18:29.500
they have low levels of brain
derived neurotrophic factor,

00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:32.140
and higher levels of obesity.

00:18:32.140 --> 00:18:35.620
Those that had a TT
pair had high levels

00:18:35.620 --> 00:18:37.420
of brain derived
neurotrophic factor,

00:18:37.420 --> 00:18:39.490
and tended to have lean figures.

00:18:39.490 --> 00:18:43.700
And those that had a TC pair--
kind of fill in the middle--

00:18:43.700 --> 00:18:46.640
they had medium likelihood
of having obesity.

00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:48.910
Now when they looked at
this by race and ethnicity,

00:18:48.910 --> 00:18:50.530
Hispanic and
African-Americans were

00:18:50.530 --> 00:18:54.310
more likely to have either
a CC pair or a CT pair

00:18:54.310 --> 00:18:55.910
compared to white individuals.

00:18:55.910 --> 00:18:58.060
And so maybe this
is one factor that

00:18:58.060 --> 00:19:02.410
plays a role in the
difference in obesity rates

00:19:02.410 --> 00:19:04.880
here in the United States.

00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:06.790
Now I'm going to switch
gears a little bit

00:19:06.790 --> 00:19:09.400
and talk about the concept
of fetal programming,

00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:14.410
and what does fetal programming
mean as it relates to obesity.

00:19:14.410 --> 00:19:15.920
And why is it important?

00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:19.750
Why do I think it is probably
one of the untapped mechanisms

00:19:19.750 --> 00:19:22.480
of controlling obesity,
not only in the US,

00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:24.040
but around the world?

00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:27.640
So if a mom goes into pregnancy
with overweight or obesity,

00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:31.520
she has increased inflammation,
increased insulin resistance,

00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:35.110
breakdown of cholesterol, and
she has inflammatory markers

00:19:35.110 --> 00:19:36.640
that are elevated.

00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:38.980
That then exposes
the fetus to lipids.

00:19:38.980 --> 00:19:40.710
Lipids are kind of cholesterol.

00:19:40.710 --> 00:19:43.540
And it reprograms
their gene targets such

00:19:43.540 --> 00:19:46.315
that they not only have an
increased amount of lipids

00:19:46.315 --> 00:19:48.250
or cholesterol in
their liver, they're

00:19:48.250 --> 00:19:50.740
also struggling with issues
in their skeletal muscle,

00:19:50.740 --> 00:19:53.350
their adipose, which is
fat tissue, their brain,

00:19:53.350 --> 00:19:54.700
and their pancreas.

00:19:54.700 --> 00:19:57.310
Then that leads to risk
of childhood disease.

00:19:57.310 --> 00:20:00.190
That NAFLD, that nonalcoholic
fatty liver disease

00:20:00.190 --> 00:20:01.840
that we talked about earlier.

00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:05.180
Insulin resistance,
obesity, hyperphasia,

00:20:05.180 --> 00:20:08.560
which means that I have an
insatiable desire to eat,

00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:09.811
and diabetes.

00:20:09.811 --> 00:20:11.560
So I just told you
that I think that there

00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:16.330
is an untapped strategy
of really targeting moms

00:20:16.330 --> 00:20:18.632
prior to conception,
and let's look at why.

00:20:18.632 --> 00:20:20.840
We're going to look at a
study that's been conducted.

00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:23.470
This is a prospective
study, so going forward,

00:20:23.470 --> 00:20:25.619
about 20 years of
duration at this time,

00:20:25.619 --> 00:20:27.160
and it's looking at
children that are

00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:30.190
born to the same mom and dad.

00:20:30.190 --> 00:20:33.110
One born before the mom
had weight loss surgery,

00:20:33.110 --> 00:20:36.390
The second born after the
mom had weight loss surgery.

00:20:36.390 --> 00:20:40.030
So same genetic makeup,
same mom and dad,

00:20:40.030 --> 00:20:43.070
but different levels of obesity.

00:20:43.070 --> 00:20:46.680
So BMS stands for
before maternal surgery.

00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:48.520
AMS stands for after
maternal surgery.

00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:52.370
And that surgery specifically
is weight loss surgery.

00:20:52.370 --> 00:20:55.220
So we're going to compare
these two columns.

00:20:55.220 --> 00:20:58.240
So obviously here,
there's similar numbers

00:20:58.240 --> 00:20:59.640
of males and females.

00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:01.390
You can see that the
birth weight of those

00:21:01.390 --> 00:21:03.940
born to the children that
were born before the mom had

00:21:03.940 --> 00:21:06.820
surgery, which means that
she had severe obesity,

00:21:06.820 --> 00:21:08.380
is different.

00:21:08.380 --> 00:21:11.240
Macrosomia means
children with a big body.

00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:13.660
So those that have
macrosomia, we

00:21:13.660 --> 00:21:16.857
can see much higher prevalence
in those born before surgery.

00:21:16.857 --> 00:21:18.940
There's also going to be
an age difference, right?

00:21:18.940 --> 00:21:21.820
So we expect these to be
older because they were born

00:21:21.820 --> 00:21:22.960
before the mom had surgery.

00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:24.340
The mom had surgery.

00:21:24.340 --> 00:21:26.320
We recommend not getting
pregnant for at least

00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:28.840
the first year, sometimes
two years post-surgery.

00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:30.430
So they're going to be younger.

00:21:30.430 --> 00:21:33.820
The body mass index
percentile lower here.

00:21:33.820 --> 00:21:35.110
Weight, lower.

00:21:35.110 --> 00:21:36.820
Body fat, lower.

00:21:36.820 --> 00:21:38.320
Insulin levels, lower.

00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:40.150
Glucose levels, lower.

00:21:40.150 --> 00:21:44.260
Same mom and dad, child
born after surgery.

00:21:44.260 --> 00:21:46.780
So when we look at children
born after maternal surgery

00:21:46.780 --> 00:21:48.910
versus those born
before surgery,

00:21:48.910 --> 00:21:51.250
there is a threefold
decrease in the prevalence

00:21:51.250 --> 00:21:53.620
of severe obesity
in the children

00:21:53.620 --> 00:21:57.440
that are born after maternal
surgery versus those before.

00:21:57.440 --> 00:21:59.130
There's improved
insulin sensitivity.

00:21:59.130 --> 00:22:02.230
We talked about insulin in
the body being anorexigenic,

00:22:02.230 --> 00:22:04.640
promoting satiety.

00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:07.930
There's improved lipid profile,
improved cholesterol profile.

00:22:07.930 --> 00:22:11.650
We have a decrease in
inflammatory markers like CRP.

00:22:11.650 --> 00:22:12.580
Decrease in leptin.

00:22:12.580 --> 00:22:14.290
increased ghrelin.

00:22:14.290 --> 00:22:17.710
And so what we see across the
board for these individuals

00:22:17.710 --> 00:22:20.050
is that the metabolic
profile has changed just

00:22:20.050 --> 00:22:22.000
by modifying the mother.

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:25.080
And by modifying the mother,
we have modified her entry

00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:26.350
into her environment.

00:22:26.350 --> 00:22:28.690
And then the long
term consequences

00:22:28.690 --> 00:22:31.210
of obesity within
the population.

00:22:31.210 --> 00:22:33.779
So I told you I would bring it
back down from the PhD level.

00:22:33.779 --> 00:22:35.320
We're talking about
the brain, right?

00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:38.530
The brain is playing a role in
weight and weight regulation,

00:22:38.530 --> 00:22:40.930
but it does get inputs
from things that we do.

00:22:40.930 --> 00:22:44.470
So diet quality is important.

00:22:44.470 --> 00:22:46.690
I ask patients about
what they're eating,

00:22:46.690 --> 00:22:49.810
not the caloric value
of what they're eating.

00:22:49.810 --> 00:22:53.290
The brain cares more about
the quality of the calories

00:22:53.290 --> 00:22:55.870
than it does about the
number of the calories.

00:22:55.870 --> 00:22:59.040
So if your diet looks like
this, the brain is happier.

00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:00.480
So if it looks more like this.

00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:03.280
Now physical activity is
one of my favorite things.

00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:05.200
Many of my lovely
gym members are here

00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:07.204
in this audience today.

00:23:07.204 --> 00:23:08.620
We spent a lot of
time at the gym.

00:23:08.620 --> 00:23:10.040
I think we like to come
and see each other,

00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:12.430
but we also like to work
out pretty aggressively.

00:23:12.430 --> 00:23:14.140
But I want us to
think about what

00:23:14.140 --> 00:23:18.460
role physical activity actually
plays in weight regulation.

00:23:18.460 --> 00:23:19.990
And what I want to
tell you guys is

00:23:19.990 --> 00:23:22.780
that on average, people
that are physically active

00:23:22.780 --> 00:23:24.670
maintain their weight.

00:23:24.670 --> 00:23:27.100
But at the beginning of the
year, every single year,

00:23:27.100 --> 00:23:30.840
people go and join the
gym to do what, you guys?

00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:31.830
Lose weight, right?

00:23:31.830 --> 00:23:34.180
And so after two months
of them going to the gym,

00:23:34.180 --> 00:23:36.840
and they don't lose
weight, what happens?

00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:38.815
They stop going
to the gym, right?

00:23:38.815 --> 00:23:40.440
They stop going to
the gym because they

00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:41.231
didn't lose weight.

00:23:41.231 --> 00:23:43.500
One of the questions that
I always ask my patients

00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:45.840
is, did you gain weight?

00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:48.670
And often, they say no, but
they went to lose weight.

00:23:48.670 --> 00:23:51.540
And so since that was not
what they accomplished,

00:23:51.540 --> 00:23:52.860
they stopped going to the gym.

00:23:52.860 --> 00:23:56.880
My thinking is that we
need to change what's

00:23:56.880 --> 00:23:58.530
being stated about
physical activity,

00:23:58.530 --> 00:24:00.930
because we know in
big meta analyzes

00:24:00.930 --> 00:24:02.790
that the role that
physical activity plays

00:24:02.790 --> 00:24:05.610
is to help with
weight maintenance,

00:24:05.610 --> 00:24:07.620
not to drive significant loss.

00:24:07.620 --> 00:24:10.050
Sleep quality and duration
plays a large role.

00:24:10.050 --> 00:24:13.997
Now this is something I do
not model well for patients.

00:24:13.997 --> 00:24:16.080
For people that know me,
they don't think I sleep.

00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:17.100
I do sleep--

00:24:17.100 --> 00:24:19.560
I just require a lot
less than most people.

00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:21.300
Not one of my stronger suits.

00:24:21.300 --> 00:24:23.850
I can model these other
things pretty well.

00:24:23.850 --> 00:24:27.330
Now medications that we as
physicians provide to patients

00:24:27.330 --> 00:24:28.955
can lead to significant
weight change--

00:24:28.955 --> 00:24:30.746
and I'll spend a little
bit of time talking

00:24:30.746 --> 00:24:32.250
about that in a few minutes.

00:24:32.250 --> 00:24:34.360
Circadian rhythm disturbances.

00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:38.040
So when we go from being a shift
worker to a night shift worker,

00:24:38.040 --> 00:24:40.290
that affects the pathways
that we've already talked

00:24:40.290 --> 00:24:42.000
about that regulate weight.

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:45.150
And just by making that
shift or transition,

00:24:45.150 --> 00:24:47.820
we see significant
shifts in weight,

00:24:47.820 --> 00:24:50.760
as studied by the
Nurses' Health Study.

00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:52.700
And then finally, thermogenesis.

00:24:52.700 --> 00:24:55.350
Thermogenesis is how
much we're burning

00:24:55.350 --> 00:24:56.670
at rest and with activity.

00:24:56.670 --> 00:24:58.600
And a lot of that's
genetic in nature.

00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:00.720
So we can't shift
that significantly.

00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:04.410
So all of these play a role in
how the body regulates weight.

00:25:04.410 --> 00:25:06.570
Now this is one of
my favorite slides.

00:25:06.570 --> 00:25:09.580
I only use it in almost
every single presentation.

00:25:09.580 --> 00:25:11.640
And these are all
of the contributors

00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:14.760
to obesity that we know
of as of right now.

00:25:14.760 --> 00:25:17.340
Now you guys remember
the kind of skills

00:25:17.340 --> 00:25:19.330
that I showed you, like
looking at calories in,

00:25:19.330 --> 00:25:21.630
calories out-- the reason
why that was inaccurate

00:25:21.630 --> 00:25:24.150
is because it didn't take
into account all the factors

00:25:24.150 --> 00:25:26.645
that you see on this slide.

00:25:26.645 --> 00:25:28.770
So what you see here are
that there are things that

00:25:28.770 --> 00:25:31.760
happen inside of an individual.

00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:35.150
There are things that happen
exterior to an individual.

00:25:35.150 --> 00:25:39.010
Things here at the top
increase how much you take in.

00:25:39.010 --> 00:25:40.690
These things here at
the bottom decrease

00:25:40.690 --> 00:25:42.280
how much you're able to burn.

00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:44.380
And these things
here in the middle

00:25:44.380 --> 00:25:47.702
affect either what you take
in, or how much you burn,

00:25:47.702 --> 00:25:49.660
or what you might be able
to see here, it says,

00:25:49.660 --> 00:25:51.790
unknown, or we just
haven't figured it out.

00:25:51.790 --> 00:25:55.960
Now these are all contributors
or influencers to obesity.

00:25:55.960 --> 00:25:58.412
And these colors
actually mean something.

00:25:58.412 --> 00:25:59.870
So these things
here in the purple,

00:25:59.870 --> 00:26:03.500
these are environmental
pressures on physical activity.

00:26:03.500 --> 00:26:04.930
These things here
in the lavender

00:26:04.930 --> 00:26:06.846
that you see kind of
scattered throughout more

00:26:06.846 --> 00:26:10.240
inside of the individual are
biological or medical reasons

00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:12.790
why someone may have obesity.

00:26:12.790 --> 00:26:15.820
Here in the yellow, maternal
or developmental reasons

00:26:15.820 --> 00:26:18.460
why someone may
struggle with obesity.

00:26:18.460 --> 00:26:20.620
The only things we
ever hear about, not

00:26:20.620 --> 00:26:23.369
only in the lay population,
but also in medicine,

00:26:23.369 --> 00:26:25.660
are these things that are
here in the pink and orange--

00:26:25.660 --> 00:26:30.050
economic reasons why someone
may struggle with weight.

00:26:30.050 --> 00:26:34.340
In orange, food and beverage
behaviors, and environments.

00:26:34.340 --> 00:26:36.270
Here in this kind
of green color,

00:26:36.270 --> 00:26:38.570
these are psychological
reasons that might

00:26:38.570 --> 00:26:40.670
be associated with weight.

00:26:40.670 --> 00:26:43.340
And then here in the blue,
we have social reasons.

00:26:43.340 --> 00:26:44.360
OK?

00:26:44.360 --> 00:26:47.634
So these are the contributors
and influencers to obesity.

00:26:47.634 --> 00:26:49.550
I'm not going to go
through each one of those.

00:26:49.550 --> 00:26:51.258
I'll give you guys
the reference for that

00:26:51.258 --> 00:26:53.280
later if you so desire.

00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:56.480
But these are contributors to
obesity inside of the person.

00:26:56.480 --> 00:26:59.060
You can see things that might
affect increasing intake.

00:26:59.060 --> 00:27:02.570
Might be hyper reactivity
to environmental food cues.

00:27:02.570 --> 00:27:05.750
Delayed satiety, so it takes
a longer time to feel full.

00:27:05.750 --> 00:27:07.890
Or disordered eating.

00:27:07.890 --> 00:27:09.770
So if we are restricting
binging, purging,

00:27:09.770 --> 00:27:10.880
things of that sort.

00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:13.070
Decreased expenditure
may be associated

00:27:13.070 --> 00:27:14.572
with a gut microbiota.

00:27:14.572 --> 00:27:16.280
You're like, what does
the gut microbiota

00:27:16.280 --> 00:27:17.450
have to do with this?

00:27:17.450 --> 00:27:19.340
When we look at the
gut microbiota, which

00:27:19.340 --> 00:27:22.550
is the bacteria in the gut
of individuals that are lean

00:27:22.550 --> 00:27:24.170
versus those that
have obesity, we

00:27:24.170 --> 00:27:27.080
see different bacteria
housed in the gut.

00:27:27.080 --> 00:27:30.320
We see a shift in the bacteria
after weight loss surgery.

00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:33.110
And we also often see a
shift if someone gets what's

00:27:33.110 --> 00:27:34.980
called a fecal transplant.

00:27:34.980 --> 00:27:38.480
So if they're getting feces
from an individual for treatment

00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:42.137
of something like C. Diff,
which is Clostridium difficile.

00:27:42.137 --> 00:27:43.970
We can see people lose
weight without making

00:27:43.970 --> 00:27:45.440
any significant
changes if they're

00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:48.796
getting the bacteria of the
gut of a lean individual.

00:27:48.796 --> 00:27:50.420
The alternate is also
true-- if they're

00:27:50.420 --> 00:27:52.580
getting the bacteria of
someone that has obesity,

00:27:52.580 --> 00:27:54.110
they may gain weight.

00:27:54.110 --> 00:27:56.570
So thermogenesis, how
the body's burned.

00:27:56.570 --> 00:28:00.020
Physical disabilities
might affect expenditure.

00:28:00.020 --> 00:28:01.730
Increase intake and
decreased expenditure

00:28:01.730 --> 00:28:04.640
may be secondary to genetic
and epigenetic factors.

00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:05.710
Age related changes.

00:28:05.710 --> 00:28:09.230
Menopause-- huge
in causing changes

00:28:09.230 --> 00:28:11.570
and how weight is distributed.

00:28:11.570 --> 00:28:13.850
I do whole hour long
lectures on that,

00:28:13.850 --> 00:28:15.140
so we won't talk about that.

00:28:15.140 --> 00:28:19.520
Mood disturbances can also
affect intake and expenditure.

00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:21.320
Those things outside
of the person.

00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:23.390
Environmental or
chemical toxins.

00:28:23.390 --> 00:28:25.250
Pervasive food advertising.

00:28:25.250 --> 00:28:27.140
Large portion sizes.

00:28:27.140 --> 00:28:28.910
The built environment,
sedentary time,

00:28:28.910 --> 00:28:31.757
and labor saving devices
might decrease expenditure.

00:28:31.757 --> 00:28:34.340
And things that might increase
intake and decrease expenditure

00:28:34.340 --> 00:28:36.890
may be things like
stress, or weight cycling.

00:28:36.890 --> 00:28:38.510
What people don't
realize is that when

00:28:38.510 --> 00:28:41.750
they restrict their eating,
the body recognize what

00:28:41.750 --> 00:28:43.430
it's baseline or set point is.

00:28:43.430 --> 00:28:47.780
As we diet to lose weight, the
body gets very angry with us,

00:28:47.780 --> 00:28:49.770
and it rebounds, usually
at a higher set point.

00:28:49.770 --> 00:28:53.090
So weight cycling leads to a
consistent increase in weight

00:28:53.090 --> 00:28:54.440
over time.

00:28:54.440 --> 00:28:56.270
And then maternal
and paternal obesity

00:28:56.270 --> 00:28:58.260
can affect this as well.

00:28:58.260 --> 00:29:01.010
So I'm going to take you
back to my childhood,

00:29:01.010 --> 00:29:03.360
because I want to shift into
talking about weight bias.

00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:04.776
And I think this
is very important

00:29:04.776 --> 00:29:07.490
because weight bias, I think,
does preclude our ability

00:29:07.490 --> 00:29:11.270
to focus on this disease and
the treatment of this disease.

00:29:11.270 --> 00:29:15.260
This is me back when I was
like, I don't know, six.

00:29:15.260 --> 00:29:17.150
This is my little sister.

00:29:17.150 --> 00:29:20.240
My little sister is also
37, but I talk about her

00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:23.066
like she's a child.

00:29:23.066 --> 00:29:24.440
The reason why I
bring this up is

00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:27.300
because at a recent
obesity convention,

00:29:27.300 --> 00:29:29.780
I was approached by a
childhood friend of mine

00:29:29.780 --> 00:29:32.730
from about this time
frame, who came up to me,

00:29:32.730 --> 00:29:34.980
and she said, well, Fatima,
I'm trying to talk to you.

00:29:34.980 --> 00:29:36.422
And I'm like, OK.

00:29:36.422 --> 00:29:38.630
Different people kept trying
to pull me aside to talk

00:29:38.630 --> 00:29:39.838
about other different issues.

00:29:39.838 --> 00:29:41.540
She kept trying to get me alone.

00:29:41.540 --> 00:29:44.360
Couldn't figure
out why this was.

00:29:44.360 --> 00:29:46.730
And she was like,
well, Fatima, I just

00:29:46.730 --> 00:29:49.490
want you to know that there
is a reason why I've always

00:29:49.490 --> 00:29:53.720
been relatively standoffish
as it relates to your.

00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:54.740
I just had not noticed.

00:29:54.740 --> 00:29:56.573
I just thought that's
how she was since I've

00:29:56.573 --> 00:29:58.390
known her since I was six.

00:29:58.390 --> 00:29:59.180
I didn't know.

00:29:59.180 --> 00:30:01.040
So she was like, do
you know why that is?

00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:02.870
And I was like, no I'm not.

00:30:02.870 --> 00:30:05.630
She's like, well, you came
up to me in dance class

00:30:05.630 --> 00:30:08.960
when we were about six,
and you called me fat.

00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:10.370
Right.

00:30:10.370 --> 00:30:13.010
I don't like to be
vulnerable on stage, either.

00:30:13.010 --> 00:30:16.330
So I was like, well, I'm sure
she remembers that correctly.

00:30:16.330 --> 00:30:18.440
I'm devastated that
as the person that's

00:30:18.440 --> 00:30:21.920
supposed to be undoing weight
bias, that this has impacted

00:30:21.920 --> 00:30:23.930
her life so much
that she has gone

00:30:23.930 --> 00:30:27.770
into a career in obesity
medicine and academics.

00:30:27.770 --> 00:30:31.480
But she told me-- this is what
was the most striking portion

00:30:31.480 --> 00:30:33.200
of what she said--

00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:36.080
she said, well I feel as though
if you're capable of change,

00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:38.434
anyone is capable of change.

00:30:38.434 --> 00:30:41.176
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:41.176 --> 00:30:44.720
So I think a choked back
a tear when that happened.

00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:48.560
But I think that it
was a point well taken.

00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:53.470
And it led me to recognize that
something that I did or said--

00:30:53.470 --> 00:30:55.130
I was very apologetic
that I said

00:30:55.130 --> 00:30:56.840
this when I was six years old--

00:30:56.840 --> 00:30:59.420
had a huge impact on her life.

00:30:59.420 --> 00:31:01.410
For her, it ended up
being a positive thing.

00:31:01.410 --> 00:31:06.380
But in any way, you can tell
that this has a huge impact.

00:31:06.380 --> 00:31:08.080
So that's my story.

00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:10.250
Now let's look at bias
in Western societies.

00:31:10.250 --> 00:31:12.410
And bias that we talk
about, we don't usually

00:31:12.410 --> 00:31:13.647
hear much about weight bias.

00:31:13.647 --> 00:31:15.230
I mean although, I
think it's becoming

00:31:15.230 --> 00:31:16.730
more of a prominent issue.

00:31:16.730 --> 00:31:18.640
We hear more about race bias.

00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:21.467
So if you did a Google
search back in 2012--

00:31:21.467 --> 00:31:24.050
this was actually not reported
on in the Washington Post until

00:31:24.050 --> 00:31:25.370
2016--

00:31:25.370 --> 00:31:27.740
if you Googled young
black male, these

00:31:27.740 --> 00:31:31.095
were the images that came up.

00:31:31.095 --> 00:31:32.720
They supposedly
changed the algorithm--

00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:35.600
I didn't try this
before this talk.

00:31:35.600 --> 00:31:40.420
When you Googled young teens
without race qualifiers,

00:31:40.420 --> 00:31:42.380
you got kind of happy
looking pictures

00:31:42.380 --> 00:31:45.050
like this, which is
very, very different

00:31:45.050 --> 00:31:47.000
from what you see at the top.

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:50.570
Glamour, back in 2012,
wanted to give adjectives

00:31:50.570 --> 00:31:53.840
to describe how we
think of young women

00:31:53.840 --> 00:31:57.590
that either are lean versus
those that have obesity.

00:31:57.590 --> 00:32:00.050
And so you can see these
adjectives that are often

00:32:00.050 --> 00:32:02.990
used to describe a lean woman--

00:32:02.990 --> 00:32:05.420
seated, ambitious,
confident, mean.

00:32:05.420 --> 00:32:07.880
For someone that has
obesity, the presumption

00:32:07.880 --> 00:32:11.900
is she's undisciplined,
insecure, giving, lazy,

00:32:11.900 --> 00:32:14.750
passive, nice.

00:32:14.750 --> 00:32:16.040
And so we do have these.

00:32:16.040 --> 00:32:20.020
I would say that what's become
the most common form of bias

00:32:20.020 --> 00:32:22.520
that's accepted is weight bias.

00:32:22.520 --> 00:32:26.250
Really, you know these are kind
of terms that we think about.

00:32:26.250 --> 00:32:28.880
So how early does
weight bias begin?

00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:32.210
And it's going to be
shocking to recognize

00:32:32.210 --> 00:32:36.290
that we start seeing weight bias
as early as 32 months of age.

00:32:36.290 --> 00:32:40.670
In this particular study, they
looked at 70 mother and child

00:32:40.670 --> 00:32:45.020
pairs, where they showed
the infants pictures.

00:32:45.020 --> 00:32:47.060
And those that were
11 months of age

00:32:47.060 --> 00:32:49.680
had a preference for looking
at figures with obesity.

00:32:49.680 --> 00:32:51.860
So this is is kind of the
pictures they were shown.

00:32:51.860 --> 00:32:53.930
By the time they got
to 32 months however,

00:32:53.930 --> 00:32:55.880
they changed to
going to the more

00:32:55.880 --> 00:32:57.890
average or lean individuals.

00:32:57.890 --> 00:33:00.920
And that was specifically
based on the maternal's

00:33:00.920 --> 00:33:02.300
anti-fat attitudes.

00:33:02.300 --> 00:33:06.560
So if the mom had significant
anti-fat attitudes,

00:33:06.560 --> 00:33:09.950
we saw a significant
shift with average age

00:33:09.950 --> 00:33:12.110
of 32 months of these
children beginning

00:33:12.110 --> 00:33:16.470
to demonstrate weight bias
against those that had obesity.

00:33:16.470 --> 00:33:18.154
Now this study was
a study that was

00:33:18.154 --> 00:33:20.570
done looking at three-year-old
children and their parents,

00:33:20.570 --> 00:33:22.130
279.

00:33:22.130 --> 00:33:24.380
And they conducted
interviews of the children.

00:33:24.380 --> 00:33:26.900
And what they saw was that
over the time of the study,

00:33:26.900 --> 00:33:29.270
there were more
negative attitudes

00:33:29.270 --> 00:33:31.820
towards large
bodied individuals,

00:33:31.820 --> 00:33:34.130
and there was awareness
of weight loss strategies

00:33:34.130 --> 00:33:36.680
that were really coming more
from the father, actually,

00:33:36.680 --> 00:33:37.890
in this situation.

00:33:37.890 --> 00:33:39.890
So this is a little bit
of a deviation from what

00:33:39.890 --> 00:33:42.440
you saw in the previous
study, but the previous only

00:33:42.440 --> 00:33:44.210
looked at mom and
children, whereas these

00:33:44.210 --> 00:33:48.000
looked at both mom,
dad, and their children.

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:51.920
So here, we're transmitting
through social cues, weight

00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:53.944
bias.

00:33:53.944 --> 00:33:54.860
This is a great study.

00:33:54.860 --> 00:33:57.320
So this looked at weight
teething and adolescence,

00:33:57.320 --> 00:34:00.650
and what that meant with regards
to weight related outcomes

00:34:00.650 --> 00:34:02.056
in adult adulthood.

00:34:02.056 --> 00:34:03.430
What they did was
they identified

00:34:03.430 --> 00:34:05.520
whether weight based
teasing, and adolescent

00:34:05.520 --> 00:34:08.270
predicted adverse eating,
and weight related outcomes

00:34:08.270 --> 00:34:11.000
15 years later.

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:13.600
They determined whether
the teasing source,

00:34:13.600 --> 00:34:16.489
the source was either
the peers or the family,

00:34:16.489 --> 00:34:18.110
affected these outcomes.

00:34:18.110 --> 00:34:21.889
And they collected this
data for 1,830 individuals

00:34:21.889 --> 00:34:26.600
from 1999 to 2015 in diverse
group of adolescents.

00:34:26.600 --> 00:34:28.639
So they looked at
race and ethnicity

00:34:28.639 --> 00:34:30.650
also along these lines.

00:34:30.650 --> 00:34:33.889
What they found was that weight
based teasing in adolescence

00:34:33.889 --> 00:34:36.179
did predict higher
body mass index

00:34:36.179 --> 00:34:38.360
and obesity 15 years later.

00:34:38.360 --> 00:34:41.540
So what they found was
that BMI increased.

00:34:41.540 --> 00:34:44.659
That led to binge eating,
more dieting, unhealthy weight

00:34:44.659 --> 00:34:47.659
control, which then
affected the body image.

00:34:47.659 --> 00:34:53.030
Now for females, both peers
and family based teasing

00:34:53.030 --> 00:34:56.540
had implications for leading
to increased disorders,

00:34:56.540 --> 00:34:59.420
eating, and having a higher BMI.

00:34:59.420 --> 00:35:02.294
Whereas for males,
only peer based teasing

00:35:02.294 --> 00:35:03.210
seemed to affect them.

00:35:03.210 --> 00:35:06.680
They weren't quite as moved by
what their family was doing.

00:35:06.680 --> 00:35:08.960
But regardless of who
the teasing is from,

00:35:08.960 --> 00:35:12.590
you can see that what a patient
experiences in adolescence does

00:35:12.590 --> 00:35:16.710
have huge implications for what
they experience in adulthood.

00:35:16.710 --> 00:35:19.160
So let's look at weight
bias internalization

00:35:19.160 --> 00:35:21.350
and metabolic syndrome.

00:35:21.350 --> 00:35:24.110
When we look at blood pressure,
waist circumference, fasting,

00:35:24.110 --> 00:35:27.560
blood sugar, triglycerides,
which is a type of cholesterol,

00:35:27.560 --> 00:35:29.570
and then HDL, which
is a good cholesterol,

00:35:29.570 --> 00:35:34.720
measured in 178 adults with
obesity in a weight loss trial.

00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:37.520
Of these adults, they
completed a weight

00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:41.500
by internalization scale, and
a patient health questionnaire.

00:35:41.500 --> 00:35:44.425
32% met criteria for
metabolic syndrome,

00:35:44.425 --> 00:35:46.550
which means they have a
predilection for developing

00:35:46.550 --> 00:35:48.630
type 2 diabetes.

00:35:48.630 --> 00:35:51.470
And this high weight
based internalization

00:35:51.470 --> 00:35:55.160
predicted the greater odds
of having metabolic syndrome

00:35:55.160 --> 00:35:58.140
and high triglycerides, which
is one of our bad cholesterols.

00:35:58.140 --> 00:36:00.740
So even though it just
seems like it's not

00:36:00.740 --> 00:36:03.140
very hurtful to
individuals, this study

00:36:03.140 --> 00:36:05.960
demonstrated that it could
be very hurtful and harmful.

00:36:08.760 --> 00:36:11.410
And also, when we look at mental
health of persons with obesity

00:36:11.410 --> 00:36:14.630
who experience bias,
physiologic stress

00:36:14.630 --> 00:36:18.320
leads to weight gain, which
then leads to disordered eating,

00:36:18.320 --> 00:36:20.730
and then, maladaptive behaviors.

00:36:20.730 --> 00:36:23.660
So it affects the mental
health of these individuals.

00:36:23.660 --> 00:36:25.820
Now in terms of
overcoming weight stigma

00:36:25.820 --> 00:36:27.760
and the treatment
of obesity, there

00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:30.410
are many different areas
that we need to work on.

00:36:30.410 --> 00:36:32.930
First, when stress
is involved, we

00:36:32.930 --> 00:36:35.270
start seeing issues
that affect food

00:36:35.270 --> 00:36:37.160
eating and physical
activity behaviors.

00:36:37.160 --> 00:36:40.070
We start seeing binge eating,
increased caloric consumption,

00:36:40.070 --> 00:36:41.840
or maladaptive weight
control, meaning

00:36:41.840 --> 00:36:44.600
using methods that aren't going
to lead to long term weight

00:36:44.600 --> 00:36:46.370
regulation.

00:36:46.370 --> 00:36:48.770
Disordered eating, lower
motivation for exercise,

00:36:48.770 --> 00:36:50.650
less physical activity.

00:36:50.650 --> 00:36:53.720
There are actual physiologic
response to weight stigma.

00:36:53.720 --> 00:36:56.660
We have increased
levels of cortisol, CRP,

00:36:56.660 --> 00:36:58.810
these are stress
hormones within the body.

00:36:58.810 --> 00:37:01.730
A1C, which is
average blood sugar.

00:37:01.730 --> 00:37:03.969
And also, elevated
blood pressure.

00:37:03.969 --> 00:37:05.510
With regards to
health care services,

00:37:05.510 --> 00:37:07.100
they have poorer
treatment adherence.

00:37:07.100 --> 00:37:09.170
They don't trust their
health providers.

00:37:09.170 --> 00:37:11.030
They avoid follow up care.

00:37:11.030 --> 00:37:12.920
They delay in preventive
health screenings.

00:37:12.920 --> 00:37:15.380
And there's poor communication.

00:37:15.380 --> 00:37:16.820
Psychological
health distress, we

00:37:16.820 --> 00:37:19.920
see depression, anxiety, low
self-esteem, poor body image,

00:37:19.920 --> 00:37:22.340
substance abuse,
and suicidality.

00:37:22.340 --> 00:37:24.260
And then physiologic
health or distress,

00:37:24.260 --> 00:37:27.620
we see poor glycemic control,
less effect of chronic disease

00:37:27.620 --> 00:37:30.710
self management, more
advanced and poorly controlled

00:37:30.710 --> 00:37:34.370
chronic disease, and lower
health related quality of life.

00:37:34.370 --> 00:37:38.060
So you can see that this weight
stigma has huge implications

00:37:38.060 --> 00:37:39.660
for the individual.

00:37:39.660 --> 00:37:41.690
Now we're going to go
quickly into looking

00:37:41.690 --> 00:37:43.370
at obesity treatments.

00:37:43.370 --> 00:37:45.500
What do we do for those
that have obesity.

00:37:45.500 --> 00:37:47.750
We talked about
93.4 million adults

00:37:47.750 --> 00:37:50.090
having obesity here
in the United States.

00:37:50.090 --> 00:37:52.670
What do I do in the clinic
setting to treat them,

00:37:52.670 --> 00:37:55.310
and what guidelines
is it based on.

00:37:55.310 --> 00:37:57.860
So here, we're looking
at BMI category,

00:37:57.860 --> 00:38:01.200
and we're looking at those that
fall into having overweight,

00:38:01.200 --> 00:38:03.530
which would be 25 to 29.9.

00:38:03.530 --> 00:38:06.320
And then class 1, mild,
class 2, moderate,

00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:09.030
or class 3, severe obesity.

00:38:09.030 --> 00:38:10.940
Now you can see diet,
physical activity,

00:38:10.940 --> 00:38:15.200
and behavioral therapy, we
can use across the spectrum

00:38:15.200 --> 00:38:16.820
of weight class.

00:38:16.820 --> 00:38:19.066
With regards to pharmacotherapy,
meaning medications

00:38:19.066 --> 00:38:21.440
we use for weight loss, we
don't begin to entertain those

00:38:21.440 --> 00:38:27.080
until we have a BMI of 27 with
co-morbidities, meaning heart

00:38:27.080 --> 00:38:30.627
disease, type 2 diabetes,
obstructive sleep apnea.

00:38:30.627 --> 00:38:32.210
And then weight loss
surgery, we start

00:38:32.210 --> 00:38:35.440
to really get into when we get
into class 1, 2, and 3 obesity.

00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:36.980
The current criteria,
technically,

00:38:36.980 --> 00:38:41.150
is class 2 with
co-morbidities or for those

00:38:41.150 --> 00:38:44.000
that have a BMI an
excess or equal to 40

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:46.280
without co-morbidities.

00:38:46.280 --> 00:38:49.800
So let's first explore common
weight promoting drugs.

00:38:49.800 --> 00:38:52.520
These are medications that
are prescribed by doctors,

00:38:52.520 --> 00:38:54.890
which lead to weight gain.

00:38:54.890 --> 00:38:57.470
I like to do a laundry list
here with all of my patients,

00:38:57.470 --> 00:39:00.240
and I ask them if they've taken
lithium, Depakote, Tegretol,

00:39:00.240 --> 00:39:02.710
Alexis, Cymbalta, Effexor,
Paxil, Prozac, Ambien,

00:39:02.710 --> 00:39:05.240
Trazodone, Lunesta, Gabapentin,
Glyburide, Glipizide,

00:39:05.240 --> 00:39:07.160
Glimepiride,
Atenolol, Metoprolol,

00:39:07.160 --> 00:39:09.794
Propanolol, long term insulin,
or long term Prednisone.

00:39:09.794 --> 00:39:12.210
And if they are taking any of
those for a month or longer,

00:39:12.210 --> 00:39:13.876
there's a high
likelihood that there was

00:39:13.876 --> 00:39:15.570
a weight contributing factor.

00:39:15.570 --> 00:39:17.070
I've put them up
here on the screen.

00:39:17.070 --> 00:39:20.060
You might have seen, I
use the generic names.

00:39:20.060 --> 00:39:22.350
But if you've been on
any of these medications,

00:39:22.350 --> 00:39:23.775
and noticed a shift
in weight, you

00:39:23.775 --> 00:39:25.400
might want to discuss
with your doctor,

00:39:25.400 --> 00:39:29.150
because I can tell you that in
medical school, in residency--

00:39:29.150 --> 00:39:30.950
and my fellowship, we
did learn about this

00:39:30.950 --> 00:39:32.900
because I did an obesity
medicine fellowship--

00:39:32.900 --> 00:39:34.490
we don't learn
about the likelihood

00:39:34.490 --> 00:39:36.740
that a lot of these drugs
lead to weight gain,

00:39:36.740 --> 00:39:39.650
and that we might need
to use alternatives

00:39:39.650 --> 00:39:42.860
to control the weight
gain that is occurring

00:39:42.860 --> 00:39:45.540
from these medications.

00:39:45.540 --> 00:39:47.390
So what I do is when
a patient comes in,

00:39:47.390 --> 00:39:48.950
I investigate whether
medications are

00:39:48.950 --> 00:39:50.780
a likely source of weight gain.

00:39:50.780 --> 00:39:54.030
If I can discontinue the drug,
that would be my first step.

00:39:54.030 --> 00:39:56.960
But if I'm unable to discontinue
it because I'm treating,

00:39:56.960 --> 00:40:01.340
let's say, a psychiatric
illness like bipolar disorder,

00:40:01.340 --> 00:40:04.970
I then need to utilize
weight-loss medications

00:40:04.970 --> 00:40:08.182
to control the weight
gain that they have.

00:40:08.182 --> 00:40:10.640
So you guys are like, weight
loss medications, really, they

00:40:10.640 --> 00:40:11.180
use those?

00:40:11.180 --> 00:40:13.070
Yes, we do.

00:40:13.070 --> 00:40:15.170
And there are three classes
of medications-- those

00:40:15.170 --> 00:40:17.180
that act centrally,
meaning in the brain

00:40:17.180 --> 00:40:19.175
to impair dietary intake.

00:40:19.175 --> 00:40:21.050
Those that act more
peripherally, so out here

00:40:21.050 --> 00:40:23.390
in the periphery, to
impair absorption.

00:40:23.390 --> 00:40:26.690
And those that increase
energy expenditure.

00:40:26.690 --> 00:40:29.780
These are the FDA approved
anti-obesity pharmacotherapy

00:40:29.780 --> 00:40:31.370
agents as of today.

00:40:31.370 --> 00:40:32.820
You'll notice
things with a star.

00:40:32.820 --> 00:40:35.090
These are approved for long
term weight regulation.

00:40:35.090 --> 00:40:40.490
And many of the star agents
were approved from 2012 to now.

00:40:40.490 --> 00:40:43.290
Phentermine is a long term drug
that you might have heard of,

00:40:43.290 --> 00:40:45.650
and people get really scared
when they hear Phentermine

00:40:45.650 --> 00:40:48.440
because fen-phen, which was
withdrawn from the market,

00:40:48.440 --> 00:40:50.400
and it did include Phentermine.

00:40:50.400 --> 00:40:52.850
But the fen that was
removed from the market

00:40:52.850 --> 00:40:56.060
was fenfluramine-- that's
the F-E-N-- fenfluramine.

00:40:56.060 --> 00:40:57.770
It caused heart valve issues.

00:40:57.770 --> 00:40:59.570
Phentermine has
remained continuously

00:40:59.570 --> 00:41:01.945
on the market since 1959.

00:41:01.945 --> 00:41:03.320
Phentermine
Topiramate in combos,

00:41:03.320 --> 00:41:05.630
so the most effective
drug that we

00:41:05.630 --> 00:41:08.550
have in the general population
for weight regulation.

00:41:08.550 --> 00:41:10.910
Bupropion,
Wellbutrin-- people are

00:41:10.910 --> 00:41:13.610
used to hearing that name--
and Naltrexone is very commonly

00:41:13.610 --> 00:41:14.490
used.

00:41:14.490 --> 00:41:17.850
Naltrexone is what we call
an opioid antagonists.

00:41:17.850 --> 00:41:20.300
So I always warn my patients
when they go on this medicine

00:41:20.300 --> 00:41:23.350
that if they need opioid
medications for let's

00:41:23.350 --> 00:41:26.840
say, a surgery, then we would
need to remove that drug.

00:41:26.840 --> 00:41:29.580
And also, I would warn them
that the stigma surrounding

00:41:29.580 --> 00:41:34.694
the opioid epidemic here
in the United States

00:41:34.694 --> 00:41:36.360
is such that when
people see Naltrexone,

00:41:36.360 --> 00:41:37.943
they will immediately
assume that they

00:41:37.943 --> 00:41:40.830
had an opioid issue, as opposed
to recognizing that it's

00:41:40.830 --> 00:41:43.200
used for weight regulation.

00:41:43.200 --> 00:41:44.940
These are other
anti-obesity agents

00:41:44.940 --> 00:41:48.270
that I might utilize that
aren't necessarily FDA approved.

00:41:48.270 --> 00:41:50.560
You may have seen them
in combination approved,

00:41:50.560 --> 00:41:53.160
not approved as
individual agents.

00:41:53.160 --> 00:41:55.856
But we will utilize
these readily.

00:41:55.856 --> 00:41:57.480
Now with weight loss
surgery, we talked

00:41:57.480 --> 00:41:59.550
about using weight
loss surgery for those

00:41:59.550 --> 00:42:03.150
that have been trying
to lose weight, still

00:42:03.150 --> 00:42:05.580
struggle with moderate
to severe obesity.

00:42:05.580 --> 00:42:07.800
For those that have class
2 or moderate obesity,

00:42:07.800 --> 00:42:11.100
they do need to have a
serious co-morbidity of type 2

00:42:11.100 --> 00:42:13.950
diabetes, heart disease,
or obstructive sleep apnea.

00:42:13.950 --> 00:42:16.410
Prior unsuccessful
weight loss attempts,

00:42:16.410 --> 00:42:18.760
acceptable operative
risk, and the ability

00:42:18.760 --> 00:42:21.960
to participate long term
treatment and follow up.

00:42:21.960 --> 00:42:24.330
And an understanding of the
operation and the lifestyle

00:42:24.330 --> 00:42:27.760
changes needed to
sustain weight loss.

00:42:27.760 --> 00:42:30.870
These are the two most
commonly performed procedures

00:42:30.870 --> 00:42:32.160
here in the United States.

00:42:32.160 --> 00:42:36.120
The sleeve gastrectomy here
is the most common procedure.

00:42:36.120 --> 00:42:38.400
People think that the
bypass is the most common,

00:42:38.400 --> 00:42:40.680
but that has not been the
most common procedure here

00:42:40.680 --> 00:42:43.360
in the United States at least
for the last seven years.

00:42:43.360 --> 00:42:44.710
So this is the most common.

00:42:44.710 --> 00:42:47.310
So you might wonder, oh, it's
because the stomach is smaller.

00:42:47.310 --> 00:42:49.380
No, it's because we
remove the stomach,

00:42:49.380 --> 00:42:52.440
and ghrelin, which you guys
remember, which is orexigenic,

00:42:52.440 --> 00:42:55.560
or promoted appetite,
is housed here

00:42:55.560 --> 00:42:57.300
in the fundus of the stomach.

00:42:57.300 --> 00:42:59.610
Same with the Roux-en-Y
gastric bypass.

00:42:59.610 --> 00:43:03.720
We are circumventing all of
this portion of the stomach

00:43:03.720 --> 00:43:05.790
and the beginning portion
of the small intestine.

00:43:05.790 --> 00:43:08.610
When someone eats something,
they go and bypass

00:43:08.610 --> 00:43:12.700
that portion, and it comes
right into the small intestine.

00:43:12.700 --> 00:43:13.950
So it's not really the sides--

00:43:13.950 --> 00:43:17.370
it's the change in the brain
and gut communication that leads

00:43:17.370 --> 00:43:18.454
to the weight loss change.

00:43:18.454 --> 00:43:20.869
And I'll take you through a
few cases, and then we'll end,

00:43:20.869 --> 00:43:22.960
and I'll entertain
some questions.

00:43:22.960 --> 00:43:25.649
So I should be finished
relatively soon.

00:43:25.649 --> 00:43:27.440
But I want to give you
guys a few patients.

00:43:27.440 --> 00:43:29.574
I thought about whether
or not to do this,

00:43:29.574 --> 00:43:30.990
but I think it's
important for you

00:43:30.990 --> 00:43:33.980
to understand what it
looks like in real life.

00:43:33.980 --> 00:43:35.550
So this is a
54-year-old one that

00:43:35.550 --> 00:43:38.359
came into me with hypertension--
untreated hypertension--

00:43:38.359 --> 00:43:39.150
migraine headaches.

00:43:39.150 --> 00:43:41.340
She had reflux,
irritable bowel syndrome,

00:43:41.340 --> 00:43:42.330
and metabolic syndrome.

00:43:42.330 --> 00:43:45.050
She retained 20 pounds with
each of her two pregnancies,

00:43:45.050 --> 00:43:47.610
and she's tried many
commercial programs, which

00:43:47.610 --> 00:43:49.800
lead to 20 pounds of
unsustainable weight loss

00:43:49.800 --> 00:43:50.829
with each attempt.

00:43:50.829 --> 00:43:53.370
Her most significant weight loss
was with the use of fen-phen

00:43:53.370 --> 00:43:54.210
in the 1990's.

00:43:54.210 --> 00:43:56.479
She lost over 50 pounds over
the course of six months.

00:43:56.479 --> 00:43:58.770
She comes in to me specifically
interest of weight loss

00:43:58.770 --> 00:44:01.740
medications, plus
behavioral therapy.

00:44:01.740 --> 00:44:04.410
These graphs-- you'll see
a couple more after this.

00:44:04.410 --> 00:44:05.910
We have weight in pounds here.

00:44:05.910 --> 00:44:07.890
We have BMI or body
mass index here.

00:44:07.890 --> 00:44:09.480
And we have time here.

00:44:09.480 --> 00:44:11.280
So you can see for
this individual is

00:44:11.280 --> 00:44:13.930
that every time she would
lose that 20 pounds,

00:44:13.930 --> 00:44:15.070
she would gain it back.

00:44:15.070 --> 00:44:17.070
She's lose the 20 pounds,
she gained it back.

00:44:17.070 --> 00:44:20.040
So of course, she comes to
see me here at a BMI of 40.

00:44:20.040 --> 00:44:23.100
And she has a significant
drop to a BMI of 31.

00:44:23.100 --> 00:44:25.350
I'm going to have you guys
yell out from the audience.

00:44:25.350 --> 00:44:28.900
What do you guys
think I did for her?

00:44:28.900 --> 00:44:29.860
Weight loss surgery.

00:44:29.860 --> 00:44:30.430
Absolutely.

00:44:30.430 --> 00:44:31.300
That's a good guess.

00:44:31.300 --> 00:44:32.935
Anyone else want to
guess differently?

00:44:35.730 --> 00:44:36.730
This was all behavioral.

00:44:36.730 --> 00:44:39.450
Now this shocked me just
as much as it shocks you,

00:44:39.450 --> 00:44:41.040
because she'd try, right?

00:44:41.040 --> 00:44:43.140
She tried and lost,
tried and lost.

00:44:43.140 --> 00:44:44.940
And for some reason,
when she came in

00:44:44.940 --> 00:44:46.890
and did our Healthy
Habits for Life program,

00:44:46.890 --> 00:44:49.260
she was able to
achieve a BMI 31.

00:44:49.260 --> 00:44:52.530
Now you can see that she's
stabilized here at a BMI of 30,

00:44:52.530 --> 00:44:55.260
and she's had some
subsequent drops.

00:44:55.260 --> 00:44:58.330
And that was when I added
medication and to keep her

00:44:58.330 --> 00:45:00.270
at this different set point.

00:45:00.270 --> 00:45:01.920
You can see that she comes down.

00:45:01.920 --> 00:45:05.640
But a typical graph here--
behavior, medication, surgery--

00:45:05.640 --> 00:45:07.380
is they'll come down,
and they rebound.

00:45:07.380 --> 00:45:10.950
I caught her when she rebounded,
I added another medicine.

00:45:10.950 --> 00:45:14.160
And so she is now here
with two different drugs,

00:45:14.160 --> 00:45:18.390
on board for the
utilization for weight loss.

00:45:18.390 --> 00:45:19.440
Let's take you to case 2.

00:45:19.440 --> 00:45:20.680
This is a 57-year-old woman.

00:45:20.680 --> 00:45:23.013
You might be like, why am I
using all 50-year-old women.

00:45:23.013 --> 00:45:25.500
The typical patient that
presents for weight management

00:45:25.500 --> 00:45:28.950
is a Caucasian
post-menopausal woman.

00:45:28.950 --> 00:45:30.942
That's who we will
typically see in the office.

00:45:30.942 --> 00:45:33.150
Those are the people that
are like, what is going on,

00:45:33.150 --> 00:45:35.860
I'm doing all the right
things, why am I struggling.

00:45:35.860 --> 00:45:37.860
OK, so this woman had a
history of dyslipidemia,

00:45:37.860 --> 00:45:40.151
which means high cholesterol,
breast cancer, high blood

00:45:40.151 --> 00:45:41.660
pressure, depression.

00:45:41.660 --> 00:45:43.560
You can see her diet--
pretty good, right?

00:45:43.560 --> 00:45:45.690
Brown rice, cashews,
goat cheese.

00:45:45.690 --> 00:45:47.180
She eats fish.

00:45:47.180 --> 00:45:52.050
She eats some nuts, and
spinach, salad for dinner.

00:45:52.050 --> 00:45:53.440
She exercises quite a bit.

00:45:53.440 --> 00:45:56.500
She does cardio interval
circuit three times per week.

00:45:56.500 --> 00:45:57.812
Two videos for a half hour.

00:45:57.812 --> 00:45:58.770
She does yoga at night.

00:45:58.770 --> 00:45:59.894
She sleeps for eight hours.

00:45:59.894 --> 00:46:02.970
So you're kind of like, what
do I do differently, right?

00:46:02.970 --> 00:46:03.810
She's doing a lot.

00:46:03.810 --> 00:46:05.370
So remember, the
same graph, right?

00:46:05.370 --> 00:46:06.880
Now it's graph.

00:46:06.880 --> 00:46:08.840
Weight in pounds on this axis.

00:46:08.840 --> 00:46:11.520
BMI, body mass index here.

00:46:11.520 --> 00:46:13.680
She starts off at a BMI of 56.

00:46:13.680 --> 00:46:15.300
Pretty severe obesity, right?

00:46:15.300 --> 00:46:18.840
BMIs in excess of 40
are considered severe.

00:46:18.840 --> 00:46:21.660
And she has this lovely
drop to a BMI of 33.

00:46:21.660 --> 00:46:23.190
This is back-- you can see--

00:46:23.190 --> 00:46:25.470
many years ago, 2003.

00:46:25.470 --> 00:46:30.366
And what do you think
drove about this change?

00:46:30.366 --> 00:46:32.380
Everybody's whispering.

00:46:32.380 --> 00:46:33.140
Surgery.

00:46:33.140 --> 00:46:35.060
That's a reasonable thought.

00:46:35.060 --> 00:46:37.362
This was medication.

00:46:37.362 --> 00:46:39.570
Now you might be like, wow,
that's pretty impressive.

00:46:39.570 --> 00:46:40.861
That's why she makes my graphs.

00:46:40.861 --> 00:46:42.870
But she has a rebound.

00:46:42.870 --> 00:46:44.600
So she comes back up
to this BMI of 40.

00:46:44.600 --> 00:46:48.470
Her BMI 40 is not
that BMI of 56,

00:46:48.470 --> 00:46:50.990
but something happens, and
it drives her back down

00:46:50.990 --> 00:46:53.810
to this BMI of 33.

00:46:53.810 --> 00:46:58.700
So that was back in
2005, end of 2005.

00:46:58.700 --> 00:46:59.767
What drove her back?

00:46:59.767 --> 00:47:01.850
I mean, she goes from 40
to 33-- not a huge shift,

00:47:01.850 --> 00:47:03.110
but you know--

00:47:03.110 --> 00:47:05.920
what do you guys think?

00:47:05.920 --> 00:47:06.850
No, she dropped.

00:47:06.850 --> 00:47:09.270
She [INAUDIBLE] the drop.

00:47:09.270 --> 00:47:10.790
Menopause and drop--

00:47:10.790 --> 00:47:14.060
I can tell you, my
patients will love that.

00:47:14.060 --> 00:47:15.890
What do you guys think?

00:47:15.890 --> 00:47:18.790
You said something,
what did you say?

00:47:18.790 --> 00:47:20.230
Romantic?

00:47:20.230 --> 00:47:22.460
A romantic involvement--
that's the first.

00:47:22.460 --> 00:47:24.950
I like that answer.

00:47:24.950 --> 00:47:28.110
That's when she had her
Roux-en-Y gastric bypass.

00:47:28.110 --> 00:47:29.900
So her surgery didn't
really do very much,

00:47:29.900 --> 00:47:31.191
would you guys agree with that?

00:47:31.191 --> 00:47:33.484
Very, very low
amount of efficacy.

00:47:33.484 --> 00:47:35.150
She comes in, of
course, to see me here,

00:47:35.150 --> 00:47:37.442
because that's when patients
like to come in to me.

00:47:37.442 --> 00:47:39.650
I would have loved to have
seen her anywhere in here,

00:47:39.650 --> 00:47:41.900
but that's just not what I get.

00:47:41.900 --> 00:47:44.030
So she comes into
the BMI of 44.5,

00:47:44.030 --> 00:47:47.130
she gets driven down
to a BMI of 28.5.

00:47:47.130 --> 00:47:50.920
And what do you guys think
I did for her at this point?

00:47:50.920 --> 00:47:51.810
Behavior?

00:47:51.810 --> 00:47:53.310
You guys are coming
on to something.

00:47:53.310 --> 00:47:56.040
I will not do anything until
the behavior is controlled.

00:47:56.040 --> 00:47:56.550
What else?

00:47:59.180 --> 00:48:00.800
I put her back on
the drug she was on.

00:48:00.800 --> 00:48:04.514
So her doctor stopped these
medications because he said,

00:48:04.514 --> 00:48:06.680
oh, well, you can't be on
the medications long term.

00:48:06.680 --> 00:48:09.096
Remember, I told you these are
approved for long term use.

00:48:09.096 --> 00:48:10.720
When we're using
medications to treat

00:48:10.720 --> 00:48:14.050
a chronic disease, this
chronic disease being obesity,

00:48:14.050 --> 00:48:16.450
when I withdraw those
agents, the brain

00:48:16.450 --> 00:48:19.780
gets back to where it was, and
you will regain the weight.

00:48:19.780 --> 00:48:21.790
So I do have to keep
her on these long term.

00:48:21.790 --> 00:48:25.710
So that's important for me
to discuss with my patients.

00:48:25.710 --> 00:48:27.280
I have a 49-year-old
Hispanic woman

00:48:27.280 --> 00:48:29.420
coming in with the issue
of anxiety and depression.

00:48:29.420 --> 00:48:31.480
She has a ventricular
tachycardia,

00:48:31.480 --> 00:48:32.860
which means that
her heart beats,

00:48:32.860 --> 00:48:35.410
and she had an ablation,
which controlled that.

00:48:35.410 --> 00:48:38.290
She has mixed connection of
tissue disease, hypertension,

00:48:38.290 --> 00:48:39.360
reflux.

00:48:39.360 --> 00:48:41.919
This is her diet, this
is her exercise regimen.

00:48:41.919 --> 00:48:43.960
She noticed that her weight
gain became prominent

00:48:43.960 --> 00:48:44.750
after childbirth.

00:48:44.750 --> 00:48:47.669
She gained 10 pounds with
each of her six pregnancies.

00:48:47.669 --> 00:48:49.210
She also noticed
that she gain weight

00:48:49.210 --> 00:48:51.130
when she stopped
smoking, and when

00:48:51.130 --> 00:48:54.080
she went on Metoprolol, which
is a commonly used beta blocker,

00:48:54.080 --> 00:48:57.100
which she went on initially
for her ventricular tachycardia

00:48:57.100 --> 00:48:57.744
up here.

00:48:57.744 --> 00:48:59.410
So you can see this
is what she's doing.

00:48:59.410 --> 00:49:01.840
She comes in to see me
here at a BMI of 52.

00:49:01.840 --> 00:49:03.310
Remember, that is
severe obesity--

00:49:03.310 --> 00:49:05.200
BMIs of greater than 40.

00:49:05.200 --> 00:49:09.520
She does have a drop
here to BMI of 26.5.

00:49:09.520 --> 00:49:11.680
So what do we think happened
for this individual?

00:49:11.680 --> 00:49:14.020
Also, notice how her brain
was defending that set point

00:49:14.020 --> 00:49:16.930
kind of in this range of
severe obesity with some ups

00:49:16.930 --> 00:49:22.270
and downs, but never down here,
or never significantly up here.

00:49:22.270 --> 00:49:24.980
So initially, I did behavioral.

00:49:24.980 --> 00:49:26.950
So I figure I'll always
start with behavioral.

00:49:26.950 --> 00:49:29.200
She had a significant drop.

00:49:29.200 --> 00:49:34.174
And then subsequently,
I did surgery for her.

00:49:34.174 --> 00:49:35.590
And so you can see
that we've been

00:49:35.590 --> 00:49:38.110
able to drive her into a
completely different set

00:49:38.110 --> 00:49:40.040
point for her weight.

00:49:40.040 --> 00:49:41.560
Finally, we have a
36-year-old woman

00:49:41.560 --> 00:49:45.220
coming in with hypothyroidism,
dysthymia, meaning low mood,

00:49:45.220 --> 00:49:48.040
allergic rhinitis, chronic
back pain, migraine headaches.

00:49:48.040 --> 00:49:50.170
Has a pretty virtuous diet here.

00:49:50.170 --> 00:49:52.061
Cardio at the gym
five days per week.

00:49:52.061 --> 00:49:53.560
She's on the
elliptical for an hour.

00:49:53.560 --> 00:49:55.300
She walks at lunchtime
for 45 minutes.

00:49:55.300 --> 00:49:58.300
She strength trains three
times per week for one hour.

00:49:58.300 --> 00:50:01.660
Her trainer sends in
the information to me

00:50:01.660 --> 00:50:05.020
on a weekly basis during the
time I was taking care for.

00:50:05.020 --> 00:50:07.600
Sleeps six to seven hours
a night of restful sleep.

00:50:07.600 --> 00:50:09.850
Comes in at a BMI of 36.

00:50:09.850 --> 00:50:12.880
You guys will remember that
class 2 or moderate obesity.

00:50:12.880 --> 00:50:16.210
She does drop here
to this BMI of 29.5.

00:50:16.210 --> 00:50:18.880
So she comes out of obesity
right into what is considered

00:50:18.880 --> 00:50:20.829
overweight category.

00:50:20.829 --> 00:50:22.120
That was with the use of drugs.

00:50:22.120 --> 00:50:25.280
But notice she comes back
within a four month period.

00:50:25.280 --> 00:50:27.380
She comes back with BMI of 36.

00:50:27.380 --> 00:50:31.120
So what happened to
this lovely individual?

00:50:31.120 --> 00:50:34.434
Why does she come back?

00:50:34.434 --> 00:50:35.850
She stopped taking
the medication.

00:50:35.850 --> 00:50:37.790
Why, as a 36-year-old
woman, did she

00:50:37.790 --> 00:50:40.865
stop taking these medications.

00:50:40.865 --> 00:50:41.990
She wanted to get pregnant.

00:50:41.990 --> 00:50:42.590
Absolutely.

00:50:42.590 --> 00:50:44.780
So for all of my women
of childbearing age

00:50:44.780 --> 00:50:47.384
that went to go to
these meds, I tell them,

00:50:47.384 --> 00:50:49.550
I have to stop these because
they're contraindicated

00:50:49.550 --> 00:50:51.080
during use of pregnancy.

00:50:51.080 --> 00:50:54.000
And it took us two years
for her to lose the weight.

00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:56.270
Four months for her to
gain the weight back.

00:50:56.270 --> 00:50:59.240
So it shows you that if
I stop these medications,

00:50:59.240 --> 00:51:00.974
that is quite an issue.

00:51:00.974 --> 00:51:02.640
I promise in two
minutes, we'll be done.

00:51:02.640 --> 00:51:05.760
The costs of obesity around
the world-- pretty steep.

00:51:05.760 --> 00:51:07.430
And this is taken
from 2014 data,

00:51:07.430 --> 00:51:09.260
so the numbers are
probably even steeper.

00:51:09.260 --> 00:51:12.650
There's is no good study that
supports the new numbers.

00:51:12.650 --> 00:51:15.830
You can see the United States
down here to $147 billion.

00:51:15.830 --> 00:51:18.890
Some estimates are
upwards of $350 billion

00:51:18.890 --> 00:51:20.420
here in the United States.

00:51:20.420 --> 00:51:24.620
When we look at it from its
impact on the global GDP,

00:51:24.620 --> 00:51:27.780
$2.1 trillion for smoking,
$2.1 for armed violence,

00:51:27.780 --> 00:51:28.790
war on terrorism.

00:51:28.790 --> 00:51:32.870
$2 trillion for obesity.
$1.4 trillion for alcoholism.

00:51:32.870 --> 00:51:35.400
So this is a big policy issue.

00:51:35.400 --> 00:51:37.370
So it's the big
policy issue, and we

00:51:37.370 --> 00:51:38.540
should have some targets.

00:51:38.540 --> 00:51:40.970
Let's look at what we're doing
here in the United States.

00:51:40.970 --> 00:51:42.770
We have some obesity
targets, but do we

00:51:42.770 --> 00:51:44.270
have any national
obesity policy?

00:51:44.270 --> 00:51:45.075
No.

00:51:45.075 --> 00:51:47.490
State long policy, it depends.

00:51:47.490 --> 00:51:49.612
Guidance-- so surgery
and drugs-- yes.

00:51:49.612 --> 00:51:52.070
So why is it that we haven't
looked at all of these things?

00:51:52.070 --> 00:51:53.944
I can tell you that
right now before Congress

00:51:53.944 --> 00:51:56.270
is the Treat and Reduce
Obesity Act, which

00:51:56.270 --> 00:51:58.640
has gone now before
Congress for the third time.

00:51:58.640 --> 00:52:02.480
I've been on Capitol Hill
way too often lately.

00:52:02.480 --> 00:52:05.240
And it's really to support
the treatment of obesity

00:52:05.240 --> 00:52:07.160
for those individuals
that have obesity.

00:52:07.160 --> 00:52:09.170
It does have bipartisan
support, but it just

00:52:09.170 --> 00:52:11.510
has not risen to the
level of importance

00:52:11.510 --> 00:52:13.880
such that it ever gets passed.

00:52:13.880 --> 00:52:15.200
So what's the summary?

00:52:15.200 --> 00:52:17.785
Obesity is a
multi-factorial disorder,

00:52:17.785 --> 00:52:19.910
and conventional weight
loss should consist of diet

00:52:19.910 --> 00:52:22.310
and exercise first,
but we may need

00:52:22.310 --> 00:52:24.860
to utilize additional
tools to treat individuals

00:52:24.860 --> 00:52:26.750
that struggle with obesity.

00:52:26.750 --> 00:52:28.880
Pharmacotherapy and/or
bariatric surgery

00:52:28.880 --> 00:52:30.380
should be considered
as an option

00:52:30.380 --> 00:52:32.540
for appropriate patients.

00:52:32.540 --> 00:52:36.800
And that weight bias is
seen as early as infancy.

00:52:36.800 --> 00:52:39.230
Maternal and paternal
anti-fat bias

00:52:39.230 --> 00:52:41.960
does significantly influence
children's behavior,

00:52:41.960 --> 00:52:45.320
and that can have huge
implications for individuals.

00:52:45.320 --> 00:52:47.360
We know that weight stigma
has a negative impact

00:52:47.360 --> 00:52:50.300
on the health and psychological
health of patients

00:52:50.300 --> 00:52:52.292
who struggle with obesity.

00:52:52.292 --> 00:52:53.750
Obesity is a chronic
disease, which

00:52:53.750 --> 00:52:57.740
requires lifelong
treatment and management.

00:52:57.740 --> 00:53:00.009
I'd like to thank you
so much for your time.

00:53:00.009 --> 00:53:02.300
And I don't know if I have
time to entertain questions,

00:53:02.300 --> 00:53:04.520
but I'm available to
entertain questions.

00:53:04.520 --> 00:53:05.797
So thank you so much.

00:53:05.797 --> 00:53:07.665
[APPLAUSE]

00:53:11.870 --> 00:53:13.760
I think they're going
to bring up mics.

00:53:13.760 --> 00:53:15.980
I can hear very
well, so I'm going

00:53:15.980 --> 00:53:17.510
to repeat back the question.

00:53:17.510 --> 00:53:19.578
You have a question.

00:53:19.578 --> 00:53:23.952
- What do you know about the
[INAUDIBLE] to talking about

00:53:23.952 --> 00:53:28.070
[INAUDIBLE]

00:53:28.070 --> 00:53:28.570
- 80-20.

00:53:28.570 --> 00:53:29.980
Tell me talk about the 80-20.

00:53:29.980 --> 00:53:36.170
- Like the 20% of
factors [INAUDIBLE]..

00:53:36.170 --> 00:53:36.670
- OK.

00:53:36.670 --> 00:53:40.490
So the question was, what
do we know, basically,

00:53:40.490 --> 00:53:44.840
about the contributing factors,
and the relative importance,

00:53:44.840 --> 00:53:47.116
or how they play a role.

00:53:47.116 --> 00:53:49.490
I'm going to say that the only
thing we definitively know

00:53:49.490 --> 00:53:53.450
is that genetics
contributes to 60% to 70%

00:53:53.450 --> 00:53:55.130
of obesity in this country.

00:53:55.130 --> 00:53:57.800
And that's been well
studied and well regulated.

00:53:57.800 --> 00:53:59.720
No one has done a really
great study looking

00:53:59.720 --> 00:54:01.320
at promoting medications.

00:54:01.320 --> 00:54:04.140
We do know sleep, quality of
diet, and all of those things

00:54:04.140 --> 00:54:04.640
play a role.

00:54:04.640 --> 00:54:06.424
But it's hard to say.

00:54:06.424 --> 00:54:08.090
And I think that one
of the things we do

00:54:08.090 --> 00:54:09.620
is we try to generalize it.

00:54:09.620 --> 00:54:12.020
And it's important for
me, as an individual,

00:54:12.020 --> 00:54:14.540
when I'm working with
patients, to personalize it.

00:54:14.540 --> 00:54:16.580
Because one
individual may walk in

00:54:16.580 --> 00:54:19.370
and you can see that they
respond very differently.

00:54:19.370 --> 00:54:21.620
And so I have to listen to
the nuances of what they're

00:54:21.620 --> 00:54:23.390
telling me when I'm treating.

00:54:23.390 --> 00:54:26.260
Now in terms of that
prevention side of things,

00:54:26.260 --> 00:54:27.890
I think there's some
universal themes

00:54:27.890 --> 00:54:29.329
with regard to prevention.

00:54:29.329 --> 00:54:31.370
You know, we can't change
our mom and dad, right?

00:54:31.370 --> 00:54:33.710
So if your mom and
dad have obesity,

00:54:33.710 --> 00:54:36.780
the likelihood you have
obesity is relatively high.

00:54:36.780 --> 00:54:38.630
You can't pick the parents.

00:54:38.630 --> 00:54:41.370
But we can modify
maybe the mom going in

00:54:41.370 --> 00:54:44.450
before she has a child to
modify her as much as we can.

00:54:44.450 --> 00:54:46.280
Recognizing that we
can't fix the genetics

00:54:46.280 --> 00:54:48.190
or the epigenetic
piece of things.

00:54:48.190 --> 00:54:49.820
And so I think about that--

00:54:49.820 --> 00:54:52.760
those broad statements are more
applicable to the prevention

00:54:52.760 --> 00:54:54.599
side of things as
opposed to what

00:54:54.599 --> 00:54:57.140
I do for the individual patient
that's sitting in front of me

00:54:57.140 --> 00:54:58.490
in that chair in the office.

00:54:58.490 --> 00:55:01.050
Hopefully, that explains
kind of some of the things.

00:55:01.050 --> 00:55:01.550
Yes?

00:55:01.550 --> 00:55:02.210
- Hi, thanks.

00:55:02.210 --> 00:55:03.200
- Hi, how are you?

00:55:03.200 --> 00:55:04.610
- Good, thank you.

00:55:04.610 --> 00:55:05.649
Two questions.

00:55:05.649 --> 00:55:07.190
- We'll start with
one, and then I'll

00:55:07.190 --> 00:55:08.780
do the second one, because
my brain may not remember.

00:55:08.780 --> 00:55:09.730
- OK.

00:55:09.730 --> 00:55:14.600
Behavioral methods-- what
do they usually involve?

00:55:14.600 --> 00:55:16.499
Just dietary change?

00:55:16.499 --> 00:55:18.290
- OK, so she asked
about behavioral methods

00:55:18.290 --> 00:55:19.430
for weight regulation.

00:55:19.430 --> 00:55:20.420
It depends.

00:55:20.420 --> 00:55:22.400
I think of behavior
as encompassing

00:55:22.400 --> 00:55:25.070
not only the diet
quality, but also,

00:55:25.070 --> 00:55:27.200
looking at the quality
and consistency

00:55:27.200 --> 00:55:28.430
of physical activity, right?

00:55:28.430 --> 00:55:31.250
So we need at least 150
minutes of moderate intensity

00:55:31.250 --> 00:55:34.904
physical activity per week
based upon the 2008 guidelines

00:55:34.904 --> 00:55:37.070
from the US department of
Health and Human Services.

00:55:37.070 --> 00:55:38.610
I can tell you that by
the end of this year,

00:55:38.610 --> 00:55:40.400
there are new guidelines
that will likely come out,

00:55:40.400 --> 00:55:42.020
which will be much
more aggressive.

00:55:42.020 --> 00:55:43.250
Because what we've
seen-- and I don't

00:55:43.250 --> 00:55:44.750
know if you guys have seen
the study that came out

00:55:44.750 --> 00:55:47.450
last week-- that activity
levels have actually increased

00:55:47.450 --> 00:55:48.980
dramatically over
the last 10 years

00:55:48.980 --> 00:55:50.870
amongst the US population.

00:55:50.870 --> 00:55:52.680
But the obesity
rates also increase.

00:55:52.680 --> 00:55:54.920
So it goes to show you
that physical activity is

00:55:54.920 --> 00:55:57.160
one thing that can
potentially help

00:55:57.160 --> 00:56:00.920
quell the obesity epidemic, but
it is not the end all, be all.

00:56:00.920 --> 00:56:03.100
When we're looking at
behavior, many of our patients

00:56:03.100 --> 00:56:05.087
do struggle with
psychological contributors

00:56:05.087 --> 00:56:06.420
to weight and weight regulation.

00:56:06.420 --> 00:56:08.855
So they may need intensive
work with psychologists

00:56:08.855 --> 00:56:11.720
or psychiatrists to
delve into issues

00:56:11.720 --> 00:56:15.650
that are leading to maladaptive
behaviors like we talked about.

00:56:15.650 --> 00:56:17.900
So that may be part of that.

00:56:17.900 --> 00:56:20.210
So it depends on the individual.

00:56:20.210 --> 00:56:21.950
So that kind of
encompasses a lot

00:56:21.950 --> 00:56:24.200
of the behavioral motivational
intervening surrounding

00:56:24.200 --> 00:56:25.280
some of those issues.

00:56:25.280 --> 00:56:26.529
Now you had a second question.

00:56:26.529 --> 00:56:30.920
- The second question is
about medications that reduce

00:56:30.920 --> 00:56:32.340
the absorption of nutrients.

00:56:32.340 --> 00:56:35.390
And I'm thinking of
something different.

00:56:35.390 --> 00:56:40.970
Recently, I started taking
proton pump inhibitors.

00:56:40.970 --> 00:56:43.350
- Does that affect obesity?

00:56:43.350 --> 00:56:48.080
- No, it was just [INAUDIBLE].

00:56:48.080 --> 00:56:56.990
But I am wondering if it would
make somebody hungrier not

00:56:56.990 --> 00:57:02.120
to have the use of
all the nutrients.

00:57:02.120 --> 00:57:03.319
- Not necessarily.

00:57:03.319 --> 00:57:04.610
She's talking about Omeprazole.

00:57:04.610 --> 00:57:06.235
I think that's probably
what you're on.

00:57:06.235 --> 00:57:07.430
You're using Omeprazole.

00:57:07.430 --> 00:57:09.290
Those are proton
pump inhibitors.

00:57:09.290 --> 00:57:11.870
We have not seen anything
that consistently demonstrates

00:57:11.870 --> 00:57:15.620
that they affect either
hunger or satiety by changing

00:57:15.620 --> 00:57:18.170
the amount of acid being
produced in the stomach.

00:57:18.170 --> 00:57:22.070
Usually, it's decreasing it
to a level that's more normal.

00:57:22.070 --> 00:57:26.390
So we haven't seen that as
something that's implicated.

00:57:26.390 --> 00:57:28.834
- Thank you for sharing
so much of the things

00:57:28.834 --> 00:57:30.500
that you've studied
for all these years.

00:57:30.500 --> 00:57:33.055
I'm just so impressed with
the quality of the information

00:57:33.055 --> 00:57:33.790
that you shared.

00:57:33.790 --> 00:57:35.810
I'm so lucky to be here.

00:57:35.810 --> 00:57:37.820
So my question has to
do with medication.

00:57:37.820 --> 00:57:40.770
When I studied nutrition in
college a million years ago,

00:57:40.770 --> 00:57:43.310
nobody gave me drugs, never.

00:57:43.310 --> 00:57:46.860
And then in the years
up until very recently,

00:57:46.860 --> 00:57:47.990
it was like a no no--

00:57:47.990 --> 00:57:50.080
like, why would you
take amphetamines.

00:57:50.080 --> 00:57:52.130
It's really an artificial thing.

00:57:52.130 --> 00:57:55.310
Now from what I was
watching you say,

00:57:55.310 --> 00:57:57.980
it seems that drugs
are more adapting

00:57:57.980 --> 00:58:00.710
to some physical
problem the person has

00:58:00.710 --> 00:58:03.810
with absorption, or energy
expenditure, or whatever.

00:58:03.810 --> 00:58:05.270
So that's a whole new thing.

00:58:07.790 --> 00:58:12.820
When people go on these, do
they have to take them for life?

00:58:12.820 --> 00:58:15.830
And how much weight you lose,
and then do they plateau out?

00:58:15.830 --> 00:58:18.270
How does that really work
over a long period of time?

00:58:18.270 --> 00:58:20.110
- Yeah, so you saw me shaking
my head, so I kind of answered.

00:58:20.110 --> 00:58:21.485
But you can stay
up, if you want,

00:58:21.485 --> 00:58:23.510
since I want to make
sure I'm answering you.

00:58:23.510 --> 00:58:24.690
Because not, you can
come back, and be like,

00:58:24.690 --> 00:58:25.940
that's not the answer.

00:58:25.940 --> 00:58:28.790
So yes, these medications do
need to be used chronically.

00:58:28.790 --> 00:58:31.910
Much like just treating any
other chronic disease process,

00:58:31.910 --> 00:58:34.580
if I am using a blood pressure
for high blood pressure,

00:58:34.580 --> 00:58:36.080
I withdraw that
agent, what happens?

00:58:36.080 --> 00:58:37.550
The blood pressure returns.

00:58:37.550 --> 00:58:40.280
And so we have to change our
thinking surrounding obesity

00:58:40.280 --> 00:58:42.590
to recognize it's a
chronic disease very much

00:58:42.590 --> 00:58:44.810
like high blood pressure
or type 2 diabetes.

00:58:44.810 --> 00:58:47.210
And when we withdraw
whatever that agent is,

00:58:47.210 --> 00:58:49.340
you see that graph, which
is why I specifically

00:58:49.340 --> 00:58:52.700
used that last graph to
demonstrate what happens.

00:58:52.700 --> 00:58:55.310
I see these medications as
complementary to someone

00:58:55.310 --> 00:58:57.450
that has improved
already either diet

00:58:57.450 --> 00:58:58.730
quality and physical activity.

00:58:58.730 --> 00:59:00.230
These are the
patients that come in,

00:59:00.230 --> 00:59:01.714
and they're doing
everything right.

00:59:01.714 --> 00:59:03.380
I love what they're
doing, and I'm like,

00:59:03.380 --> 00:59:05.450
there's not anything
else I can do.

00:59:05.450 --> 00:59:08.840
But we do need to modify how
your brain sees its weight set

00:59:08.840 --> 00:59:09.660
point.

00:59:09.660 --> 00:59:11.429
So most of them are
actually centrally.

00:59:11.429 --> 00:59:13.720
The ones that are most
effective tend to act centrally,

00:59:13.720 --> 00:59:15.636
but they also are
associated with higher level

00:59:15.636 --> 00:59:16.595
of side effects, right?

00:59:16.595 --> 00:59:18.219
Because if they're
acting on the brain,

00:59:18.219 --> 00:59:19.670
they may cause
cognitive slowing,

00:59:19.670 --> 00:59:21.410
they may cause word
finding difficulties,

00:59:21.410 --> 00:59:23.681
things of that sort,
which we don't want.

00:59:23.681 --> 00:59:25.180
So when I'm using
these medications,

00:59:25.180 --> 00:59:27.860
I'm very gingerly in
how I increase them,

00:59:27.860 --> 00:59:29.900
and I only increase
them when necessary.

00:59:29.900 --> 00:59:32.390
Your second question was like,
OK, so what do we expect.

00:59:32.390 --> 00:59:34.820
A good response to
medication will be 5% to 10%

00:59:34.820 --> 00:59:38.450
of total body weight loss
over the course of treatment.

00:59:38.450 --> 00:59:39.950
Now they will have--
and I said this

00:59:39.950 --> 00:59:42.020
with every single
patient-- they have a drop.

00:59:42.020 --> 00:59:43.190
They'll come down
to what's considered

00:59:43.190 --> 00:59:45.740
the [INAUDIBLE] weight, and
they will rebound and stabilize

00:59:45.740 --> 00:59:49.880
at a level that's slightly
above where they got to their

00:59:49.880 --> 00:59:50.882
[INAUDIBLE].

00:59:50.882 --> 00:59:52.340
At that time, I
can potentially try

00:59:52.340 --> 00:59:54.173
to introduce additional
agents to shift them

00:59:54.173 --> 00:59:55.297
down even further.

00:59:55.297 --> 00:59:57.380
But recognize that even
once they shift them down,

00:59:57.380 --> 00:59:59.060
there's likely going
to be a rebound.

00:59:59.060 --> 01:00:03.110
If the body's physiologic
response to either behavior,

01:00:03.110 --> 01:00:04.449
to medications, or to surgery.

01:00:04.449 --> 01:00:06.740
So they will come down, and
they'll rebound to a level.

01:00:06.740 --> 01:00:08.690
Not back to where
they were, but they'll

01:00:08.690 --> 01:00:12.020
rebound to a level that is not
the number that they remember

01:00:12.020 --> 01:00:13.856
when they bought
those new Prada pants.

01:00:13.856 --> 01:00:15.980
Because they got it at the
lowest weight set point.

01:00:15.980 --> 01:00:17.090
Because I have a
patient that wants

01:00:17.090 --> 01:00:19.730
to get into these Prada pants,
so of course that comes up.

01:00:19.730 --> 01:00:21.440
So yes, you had
another question.

01:00:21.440 --> 01:00:24.160
- So once they get down
to that weight loss,

01:00:24.160 --> 01:00:26.540
it's not like they'll
stay on that medication,

01:00:26.540 --> 01:00:30.410
like taking an ultra
vitamin dose or something.

01:00:30.410 --> 01:00:32.392
Like oh, we we've
stopped the anemia now,

01:00:32.392 --> 01:00:34.350
so you just stay at this
the rest of your life.

01:00:34.350 --> 01:00:35.310
You're always tugging.

01:00:35.310 --> 01:00:36.560
- You're always looking,
I'm always tweaking,

01:00:36.560 --> 01:00:37.226
I may be adding.

01:00:37.226 --> 01:00:38.840
I know, I know, I'm sorry.

01:00:38.840 --> 01:00:41.829
It's the reality.

01:00:41.829 --> 01:00:44.120
And that's what I tell patients
before we commit to it.

01:00:44.120 --> 01:00:45.940
Because if the medicine
works, then I'm

01:00:45.940 --> 01:00:46.940
going to keep you on it.

01:00:46.940 --> 01:00:48.020
If it doesn't work,
then obviously,

01:00:48.020 --> 01:00:48.770
we're not going
to keep you on it.

01:00:48.770 --> 01:00:49.910
We're going to keep trying.

01:00:49.910 --> 01:00:51.860
Now what I did not
talk about, and where

01:00:51.860 --> 01:00:53.750
I think the new horizon--

01:00:53.750 --> 01:00:56.080
and no one is really doing
this, and maybe somebody

01:00:56.080 --> 01:00:57.650
will fund me to start
thinking about this--

01:00:57.650 --> 01:00:59.941
is that you obviously saw
that different people respond

01:00:59.941 --> 01:01:01.160
to different therapies.

01:01:01.160 --> 01:01:02.590
Something about
the genetic makeup

01:01:02.590 --> 01:01:05.390
of that woman that allowed
her to lose more weight than I

01:01:05.390 --> 01:01:07.610
would have anticipated from
any surgery from just two

01:01:07.610 --> 01:01:09.290
medicines-- unbelievable.

01:01:09.290 --> 01:01:12.690
I told you an average 5% to
10% total body weight loss.

01:01:12.690 --> 01:01:16.809
She lost 35% of her total body
weight loss on two medicines.

01:01:16.809 --> 01:01:19.350
I wouldn't have predicted that,
but that's how she responded.

01:01:19.350 --> 01:01:21.308
Now I can tell you I'm
treating her sister now,

01:01:21.308 --> 01:01:23.500
and her sister is
responding quite similarly.

01:01:23.500 --> 01:01:27.530
So something about them allows
them to respond in that way,

01:01:27.530 --> 01:01:29.930
so much so that I would
recommend that therapy

01:01:29.930 --> 01:01:33.710
to that family, first
line, even though we're

01:01:33.710 --> 01:01:34.910
dealing with severe obesity.

01:01:34.910 --> 01:01:35.600
Does that make sense?

01:01:35.600 --> 01:01:36.100
- Yeah.

01:01:36.100 --> 01:01:37.540
I don't want to take up--

01:01:37.540 --> 01:01:39.610
- Yeah, absolutely.

01:01:39.610 --> 01:01:40.590
- What a great talk.

01:01:40.590 --> 01:01:41.990
Thank you so much great.

01:01:41.990 --> 01:01:45.500
I really appreciate the
multifactorial look,

01:01:45.500 --> 01:01:48.200
all encompassing
look at this problem.

01:01:48.200 --> 01:01:49.820
In the spirit of
I have a hammer,

01:01:49.820 --> 01:01:52.130
everything is a nail,
one of the things

01:01:52.130 --> 01:01:56.030
I look at and research is
the impact of early childhood

01:01:56.030 --> 01:02:01.970
trauma on diabetes,
and then on obesity.

01:02:01.970 --> 01:02:03.690
And then we try to unpack that.

01:02:03.690 --> 01:02:06.240
It looks like a lot of it
travels through food addiction,

01:02:06.240 --> 01:02:08.960
which you also had up there,
and particularly, early

01:02:08.960 --> 01:02:10.110
sexual abuse.

01:02:10.110 --> 01:02:10.730
- Absolutely.

01:02:10.730 --> 01:02:12.070
- Which is really prevalent.

01:02:12.070 --> 01:02:15.210
So I'm wondering about how
you see that in the clinic.

01:02:15.210 --> 01:02:17.240
Do you screen for it?

01:02:17.240 --> 01:02:17.990
Do you treat it?

01:02:17.990 --> 01:02:19.180
What works, what doesn't?

01:02:19.180 --> 01:02:20.810
Do the medicines work?

01:02:20.810 --> 01:02:22.790
What does that do
to at this point?

01:02:22.790 --> 01:02:23.870
- Very good question.

01:02:23.870 --> 01:02:26.710
Actually, so what you didn't say
when you did my introduction--

01:02:26.710 --> 01:02:28.895
because my CV is 59
pages-- is that I

01:02:28.895 --> 01:02:30.770
worked for a rape crisis
center for two years

01:02:30.770 --> 01:02:31.700
before medical school.

01:02:31.700 --> 01:02:33.620
And I could never
figure out what

01:02:33.620 --> 01:02:36.260
that work was going to
mean for what I do, but now

01:02:36.260 --> 01:02:39.770
in the work that I do, I
do see that about a third

01:02:39.770 --> 01:02:41.540
of the women that
I treat have been

01:02:41.540 --> 01:02:43.436
a victim of sexual violence--

01:02:43.436 --> 01:02:44.810
or survivor, I
don't like victim.

01:02:44.810 --> 01:02:45.601
Victims sounds bad.

01:02:45.601 --> 01:02:47.636
But survivor of sexual violence.

01:02:47.636 --> 01:02:49.260
Although if you look
in the literature,

01:02:49.260 --> 01:02:51.718
there's a paucity of literature
surrounding sexual violence

01:02:51.718 --> 01:02:54.300
and obesity, just in general.

01:02:54.300 --> 01:02:57.389
What I find is my
psychologists do a bit more

01:02:57.389 --> 01:02:59.180
of that work in terms
of working with them,

01:02:59.180 --> 01:03:02.150
using motivational interviewing,
but they will also key me

01:03:02.150 --> 01:03:04.670
in into which agents or
medications might not

01:03:04.670 --> 01:03:06.470
be effective medications.

01:03:06.470 --> 01:03:08.450
Ones that have a higher
likelihood of promoting

01:03:08.450 --> 01:03:11.810
anxiety, they'll say, I would
warn against the use of,

01:03:11.810 --> 01:03:13.450
which would likely
include Phentramine,

01:03:13.450 --> 01:03:15.940
might include
Bupropion, it depends.

01:03:15.940 --> 01:03:18.384
And they are very in tune
to what I'm thinking.

01:03:18.384 --> 01:03:20.300
So they're probably
thinking, oh, Dr. Stanford

01:03:20.300 --> 01:03:22.133
wants to use medicines,
but let me tell her,

01:03:22.133 --> 01:03:23.990
I'm really concerned
about these things.

01:03:23.990 --> 01:03:26.300
For many of our patients
that have struggled

01:03:26.300 --> 01:03:28.620
with early childhood
trauma or sexual violence,

01:03:28.620 --> 01:03:31.460
they are in lifelong therapy,
either with our psychologists

01:03:31.460 --> 01:03:33.410
at the weight center or
their own therapists.

01:03:33.410 --> 01:03:35.035
They may have another
psychiatric team,

01:03:35.035 --> 01:03:36.790
and maybe most of
their care is really

01:03:36.790 --> 01:03:39.670
within the psychological realm.

01:03:39.670 --> 01:03:43.480
You know, it looks
different for every patient.

01:03:43.480 --> 01:03:47.350
And things that I would be
sometimes reticent to consider

01:03:47.350 --> 01:03:49.532
that we may consider
after finding

01:03:49.532 --> 01:03:51.490
that certain agents,
let's say for medications,

01:03:51.490 --> 01:03:52.906
are ineffective,
and I'm like, let

01:03:52.906 --> 01:03:56.290
me try a low dose of Phentramine
might work without causing

01:03:56.290 --> 01:03:58.480
any negative
consequences, but I have

01:03:58.480 --> 01:04:01.000
to be watching that
patient on a weekly basis

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:04.580
to make sure things are going
OK for those individuals.

01:04:04.580 --> 01:04:07.420
I think there's so much
to be learned, Gina,

01:04:07.420 --> 01:04:12.040
in this realm of looking
at trauma, early childhood

01:04:12.040 --> 01:04:14.381
trauma, sexual violence, and
the implication it plays.

01:04:14.381 --> 01:04:16.630
Because it definitely has
huge implications for weight

01:04:16.630 --> 01:04:19.200
regulation in later life.

01:04:19.200 --> 01:04:20.100
- Thank you.

01:04:20.100 --> 01:04:22.020
I think I may also
be the last question,

01:04:22.020 --> 01:04:24.694
so I can take the opportunity
to thank you yet again.

01:04:24.694 --> 01:04:26.110
Oh wait, there's
another question.

01:04:26.110 --> 01:04:27.068
Can I pass you the mic?

01:04:27.068 --> 01:04:28.130
- Yes.

01:04:28.130 --> 01:04:29.680
- You were excited.

01:04:29.680 --> 01:04:30.460
Why not?

01:04:30.460 --> 01:04:31.030
Why not?

01:04:31.030 --> 01:04:31.540
I'm here.

01:04:31.540 --> 01:04:33.660
Might as well.

01:04:33.660 --> 01:04:34.160
- Hi.

01:04:34.160 --> 01:04:35.890
It was a really terrific job.

01:04:35.890 --> 01:04:37.210
Thank you so much.

01:04:37.210 --> 01:04:41.320
So you had a side way back
where you were talking

01:04:41.320 --> 01:04:42.651
about changes in birth weight.

01:04:42.651 --> 01:04:45.025
- Where we were talking mothers
before and after surgery.

01:04:45.025 --> 01:04:47.890
- Pre and post
weight loss surgery.

01:04:47.890 --> 01:04:52.600
And the difference in
the baby's birth weight.

01:04:52.600 --> 01:04:54.070
And I was wondering
whether there

01:04:54.070 --> 01:04:57.850
was any work done to look
at whether there was a link

01:04:57.850 --> 01:05:04.720
to inflammation, or whether
if it's just attributed

01:05:04.720 --> 01:05:07.087
to the double C chromosome.

01:05:07.087 --> 01:05:08.420
- No, we know it's inflammation.

01:05:08.420 --> 01:05:11.320
Remember, the second slide, we
looked at inflammatory markers

01:05:11.320 --> 01:05:13.700
within those individuals
that were after surgery,

01:05:13.700 --> 01:05:15.310
and then we saw
the lower levels.

01:05:15.310 --> 01:05:17.380
So inflammation
played a large role.

01:05:17.380 --> 01:05:20.140
Aisle 1, aisle 6, CRP-1.

01:05:20.140 --> 01:05:21.490
All of those things play a role.

01:05:21.490 --> 01:05:23.110
Those are inflammatory
markers, and we

01:05:23.110 --> 01:05:26.500
saw a significant decrease
in the inflammatory markers

01:05:26.500 --> 01:05:29.600
for both the mom, and the
child born after surgery.

01:05:29.600 --> 01:05:32.920
So I do think that
plays a large role.

01:05:32.920 --> 01:05:34.834
Yes?

01:05:34.834 --> 01:05:35.750
- So I had a question.

01:05:35.750 --> 01:05:41.080
You hinted at issues with
post-menopausal women.

01:05:41.080 --> 01:05:44.690
And I was wondering if hormone
replacement is ever a component

01:05:44.690 --> 01:05:45.990
of the overall package.

01:05:45.990 --> 01:05:46.490
- No.

01:05:46.490 --> 01:05:48.281
So hormone replacement
has never been shown

01:05:48.281 --> 01:05:49.460
to drive weight loss down.

01:05:49.460 --> 01:05:50.560
But I can explain--

01:05:50.560 --> 01:05:52.520
I didn't talk about
post-menopausal women

01:05:52.520 --> 01:05:54.170
specifically, but I
guess people might

01:05:54.170 --> 01:05:57.890
want to know what is it that
causes the shift in weight.

01:05:57.890 --> 01:06:01.250
What happens is at
menopause, we see a change

01:06:01.250 --> 01:06:02.990
in distribution
of adipose tissue

01:06:02.990 --> 01:06:05.150
from being a gynoid
distribution, which

01:06:05.150 --> 01:06:07.310
means it's in the hip,
buttock, and thigh region,

01:06:07.310 --> 01:06:11.150
to a more android distribution,
which is the central region.

01:06:11.150 --> 01:06:13.250
Which means that we
begin to assimilate more

01:06:13.250 --> 01:06:15.380
of the male body phenotype.

01:06:15.380 --> 01:06:19.130
When that shift occurs, we
start to deposit weight in areas

01:06:19.130 --> 01:06:22.640
that we are not typically
used to depositing them,

01:06:22.640 --> 01:06:26.060
but we also see this
gradual incline in weight,

01:06:26.060 --> 01:06:28.340
because estrogen helped
control or regulate

01:06:28.340 --> 01:06:32.010
some of these factors prior
to the onset of menopause.

01:06:32.010 --> 01:06:33.590
So hormone replacement therapy--

01:06:33.590 --> 01:06:37.280
I work closely with Joanne
Manson at the Brigham,

01:06:37.280 --> 01:06:39.530
who has done a lot of the
work with the Women's Health

01:06:39.530 --> 01:06:41.690
Initiative, and all
of her work has never

01:06:41.690 --> 01:06:46.070
demonstrated that HRT,
which was a lot of her work

01:06:46.070 --> 01:06:50.300
back in the '80s, early '90s,
really led to any weight drops.

01:06:50.300 --> 01:06:52.640
What I do find that
works pretty effectively

01:06:52.640 --> 01:06:54.680
for these individuals
are weight loss

01:06:54.680 --> 01:06:57.110
pharmacotherapy for
those individuals that

01:06:57.110 --> 01:06:59.210
have mild or moderate obesity.

01:06:59.210 --> 01:07:02.000
And then for those that have
severe weight loss surgery,

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:05.270
I would entertain if
they're in those ranges.

01:07:05.270 --> 01:07:07.760
Often, they come in with
these very virtuous diets.

01:07:07.760 --> 01:07:09.815
The dietitian is like,
I can't change anything.

01:07:09.815 --> 01:07:12.900
Psychologist is like, everything
looks good on their part.

01:07:12.900 --> 01:07:15.680
And so then we have to
start to begin to think

01:07:15.680 --> 01:07:17.010
of other treatment strategies.

01:07:17.010 --> 01:07:19.010
And I think about
using the right tool

01:07:19.010 --> 01:07:20.550
for the size of the problem.

01:07:20.550 --> 01:07:23.192
So people are like, really,
weight loss surgery?

01:07:23.192 --> 01:07:24.650
Isn't that a method
of last resort?

01:07:24.650 --> 01:07:26.483
That's kind of a pet
peeve when I hear that.

01:07:26.483 --> 01:07:28.260
Because we think about--

01:07:28.260 --> 01:07:30.590
I kind of use an analogy
of snow in Boston.

01:07:30.590 --> 01:07:32.570
We get 14 inches in eight hours.

01:07:32.570 --> 01:07:34.670
Do I go to use a
teaspoon or a tablespoon

01:07:34.670 --> 01:07:35.980
to scoop up the snow?

01:07:35.980 --> 01:07:38.649
Maybe it would work, but it's
going to take me a long time.

01:07:38.649 --> 01:07:40.190
I'm going to use
the appropriate tool

01:07:40.190 --> 01:07:41.357
for the size of the problem.

01:07:41.357 --> 01:07:43.190
So I'm going to probably
use a big bulldozer

01:07:43.190 --> 01:07:44.780
to bulldoze the
snow out of the way

01:07:44.780 --> 01:07:48.020
so that the traffic
can continue.

01:07:48.020 --> 01:07:50.711
And I use the appropriate tool
for the size of the problem.

01:07:50.711 --> 01:07:51.960
Some people need bigger tools.

01:07:51.960 --> 01:07:53.610
Some people need smaller tools.

01:07:53.610 --> 01:07:56.930
Some people, hey,
I lost 80 pounds

01:07:56.930 --> 01:07:58.550
from just removing
sugar from my diet.

01:07:58.550 --> 01:07:59.610
Great for them.

01:07:59.610 --> 01:08:00.110
Excellent.

01:08:00.110 --> 01:08:01.190
But just because
it worked for you,

01:08:01.190 --> 01:08:02.700
doesn't mean it's going to
work for the next person.

01:08:02.700 --> 01:08:05.699
And so I have to tune into
what works for that individual,

01:08:05.699 --> 01:08:07.490
and use the right tool
for that individual.

01:08:07.490 --> 01:08:08.990
And recognize that
that's malleable,

01:08:08.990 --> 01:08:11.750
meaning what tool
may have worked today

01:08:11.750 --> 01:08:13.490
may not always
work continuously,

01:08:13.490 --> 01:08:15.080
and I get to keep adding.

01:08:15.080 --> 01:08:16.700
Much like-- I can't remember
the individual that said,

01:08:16.700 --> 01:08:17.825
oh we have to keep trying--

01:08:17.825 --> 01:08:19.140
where's that lovely-- you.

01:08:19.140 --> 01:08:21.140
You're like, we have
to keep doing things?

01:08:21.140 --> 01:08:23.740
Yes, you have to
sometimes keep trying.

01:08:23.740 --> 01:08:25.439
It's nice when I can
just do one thing,

01:08:25.439 --> 01:08:27.720
and then I solve their
problem, which means

01:08:27.720 --> 01:08:28.970
that I didn't really solve it.

01:08:28.970 --> 01:08:30.410
I'm just treating the problem.

01:08:30.410 --> 01:08:33.529
But often, it requires
a lot of different steps

01:08:33.529 --> 01:08:34.700
that I'm having to take.

01:08:34.700 --> 01:08:37.279
And working through
all of the motion that

01:08:37.279 --> 01:08:40.340
goes into this person
struggling with weight.

01:08:40.340 --> 01:08:41.319
So yeah.

01:08:45.985 --> 01:08:46.609
She's one more.

01:08:46.609 --> 01:08:47.817
I can hear you, you can talk.

01:08:47.817 --> 01:08:49.291
- [INAUDIBLE]

01:08:49.291 --> 01:08:49.790
- Go on.

01:08:49.790 --> 01:08:50.289
OK.

01:08:54.210 --> 01:09:02.750
- OK, I'd like to suggest
that another indicator--

01:09:02.750 --> 01:09:06.590
cause-- might be
growing up feeling

01:09:06.590 --> 01:09:09.260
silenced for political reasons.

01:09:09.260 --> 01:09:11.170
And therefore, eating.

01:09:11.170 --> 01:09:18.630
And even after one works on
its ramifications in therapy,

01:09:18.630 --> 01:09:23.840
I don't think it's necessarily
easy to then just kind of lose

01:09:23.840 --> 01:09:25.399
the weight off, right?

01:09:25.399 --> 01:09:31.939
I mean, after dealing
with emotional issues,

01:09:31.939 --> 01:09:34.880
if one has been obese
all their life--

01:09:34.880 --> 01:09:35.840
- Has obesity.

01:09:35.840 --> 01:09:37.236
You don't never classify it.

01:09:37.236 --> 01:09:38.634
You have the disease.

01:09:38.634 --> 01:09:40.140
You're not classified by it.

01:09:40.140 --> 01:09:41.899
It does not govern you.

01:09:41.899 --> 01:09:42.649
- Yeah.

01:09:42.649 --> 01:09:47.149
So how does that work?

01:09:47.149 --> 01:09:49.340
- I think the question is
surrounding-- and just,

01:09:49.340 --> 01:09:50.590
you can tell me if I'm right--

01:09:50.590 --> 01:09:52.319
is if you've had a life--

01:09:52.319 --> 01:09:54.500
because I'm going
to kind of group

01:09:54.500 --> 01:09:57.650
it into people that have
had lifelong struggles.

01:09:57.650 --> 01:09:59.700
I have people that
are Syrian refugees,

01:09:59.700 --> 01:10:02.184
for example, if they've
dealt with a big struggle

01:10:02.184 --> 01:10:04.350
of that sort, how do you
deal with emotional issues.

01:10:04.350 --> 01:10:06.180
I think it's a lifelong process.

01:10:06.180 --> 01:10:08.390
It's not something I
anticipate that I will get over

01:10:08.390 --> 01:10:09.815
in three sessions with you.

01:10:09.815 --> 01:10:12.190
And that's why most of these
people do remain in therapy.

01:10:12.190 --> 01:10:15.080
People that came to our center
when it first opened in 1999,

01:10:15.080 --> 01:10:17.540
who are still seeing
our psychologists today,

01:10:17.540 --> 01:10:19.710
means that we're not
fixing it in one session.

01:10:19.710 --> 01:10:20.990
And it may never be fixed.

01:10:20.990 --> 01:10:24.540
Maybe just we've improved
upon these issues.

01:10:24.540 --> 01:10:27.470
So I think it requires lifelong
treatments with regards

01:10:27.470 --> 01:10:29.150
to the psychological issues.

01:10:29.150 --> 01:10:32.540
And for some people, maybe
lesser therapy than others.

01:10:32.540 --> 01:10:34.824
And we just have to tailor
it to fit the individual.

01:10:34.824 --> 01:10:36.276
- [iNAUDIBLE].

01:10:40.399 --> 01:10:41.690
- No, it doesn't become easier.

01:10:41.690 --> 01:10:44.106
And even after patients lose
tremendous amounts of weight,

01:10:44.106 --> 01:10:46.550
they may still
have significantly

01:10:46.550 --> 01:10:49.100
disordered thinking
as it relates

01:10:49.100 --> 01:10:50.780
to how they're
perceived, and how

01:10:50.780 --> 01:10:53.070
they navigate their daily life.

01:10:53.070 --> 01:10:53.870
Yes.

01:10:53.870 --> 01:10:56.110
So I think that I
am departing now.

01:10:56.110 --> 01:10:57.110
But it's been a delight.

01:11:00.400 --> 01:11:00.915
So yes.

01:11:00.915 --> 01:11:01.790
Well, thank you guys.

01:11:01.790 --> 01:11:02.715
Thanks for coming.

01:11:02.715 --> 01:11:05.220
I really appreciate it.
