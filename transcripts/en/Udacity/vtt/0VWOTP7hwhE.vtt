00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.600
Well let's see,
we're talking y-intercept.

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:04.380
Which means the x
coordinate's going to be 0.

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.000
And the y coordinate is just this 2.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.400
Because remember, in slope intercept
form, this is y = m times x + b.

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.020
And 2 has taken the place of b.
