00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:05.040
A startup has announced plans to host the
first live human birth IN SPACE.

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.880
That’s right, A SPACE BABY!

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:11.849
SpaceLife Origin aims to answer all our questions
about makin’ babies in space.

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.509
The team consists of several entrepreneurs
and “business experts” as well as a small

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.360
team of science advisors.

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:22.259
And their 2024 mission, dubbed “Mission
Cradle” aims to have the first human baby

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:23.390
born in space.

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:27.429
Their website doesn’t include a terrible
amount of detail as to exactly how this mission

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:28.429
will go down.

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:33.830
But it does specify it will last 24-36 hours,
and involves a pregnant woman and a “trained,

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:38.190
world class medical team” being launched
400km above earth to a space station.

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.170
There, the woman will give birth before mom
and babe are returned to the surface.

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:46.120
The website also adds that a “carefully
prepared and monitored process will reduce

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:47.420
all possible risks.”

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:52.310
But, as you can imagine, people are still
very concerned about the possible risks.

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:58.240
For starters, this plan involves putting a
VERY pregnant woman under extreme g-forces.

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:02.570
Astronauts typically experience roughly 3x
the force of gravity during rocket launches,

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:05.530
and it can be even more if something goes
wrong.

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:09.420
We don’t know what this amount of force
would do to a human mom or child.

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.000
Then there are concerns about the safety of
actually delivering a baby up there- with

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.670
no gravity to hold the mother to a delivery
bed or the doctors to the floor- things get

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:18.690
complicated quickly.

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:22.280
And don’t even get me started on the bodily
fluids.

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.390
Then of course this newborn baby will have
to survive the treacherous return trip- one

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:31.200
that involves hypersonic speeds, extreme temperatures,
and an often not-so-soft landing.

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.170
But beyond the safety concerns, getting regulatory
approval for a mission like this could be

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:37.720
extremely difficult.

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:42.250
Experimentation on human EMBRYOS already faces
strict regulation and international ethical

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:47.060
debate, so you can imagine the hurdles involved
with an experiment involving a full-term baby

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:48.060
in space.

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.549
But putting all of that aside, let’s say
they do actually manage to get this woman

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:53.799
up there and she successfully gives birth.

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:56.869
What would we expect for a baby born in microgravity?

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:01.170
There have already be a handful of experiments
involving animal reproduction in space- rodents,

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.520
fish, flies, and even jellyfish have all been
sent up there to pop out little ones.

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.700
All of these tests resulted in live offspring,
so we know the fundamental birthing process

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.700
can happen in microgravity.

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.959
And pregnant rats sent to the ISS in 2001
gave birth to pretty healthy pups.

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:21.319
Though they initially had underdeveloped vestibular
systems, after about 5 days that righted itself,

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:22.439
and they were basically normal.

00:02:22.439 --> 00:02:27.299
But ISS data involving humans in microgravity
has shown there are negative health effects

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:28.730
to being in space.

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:33.280
Bone loss and altered immune systems are common,
which could present challenges for space baby

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:34.280
#1.

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.959
People have also raised concerns about what
the recycled oxygen on board would do to the

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:42.040
baby’s lungs during its first breaths- and
concerns about the increased radiation levels

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.459
of outer space.

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:47.730
Additional research suggests that stressful
pregnancy and birthing experiences can affect

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:52.090
the growth and development of a baby, and
it’s hard to imagine giving birth on a space

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:54.590
station would be a calm experience.

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:59.430
Then, all of these potential issues are compounded
by the baby’s return to earth and first

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.340
experiences with gravity.

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.420
Will a baby born in space be able to acclimate
to the gravity of Earth?

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:08.730
It’s obviously a crazy plan, and the list
of unknowns is lengthy.

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:13.359
But SpaceLife Origin stresses that this kind
of experiment is bound to happen one way or

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:15.590
another, publicly or otherwise.

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:20.180
Learning how to reproduce in space will be
crucial if our species aims to colonize other

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:21.180
planets.

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:26.079
Though, admittedly putting a pregnant woman
in a rocket might not be the most elegant

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:27.079
solution.

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:28.260
What do you think about all this?

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:29.610
Do you think it’ll work?

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:31.129
Let us know in the comments.

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:34.680
