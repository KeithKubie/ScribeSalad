00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.691
Before I begin today,
I thought I would take the

00:00:03.691 --> 00:00:08.167
first five minutes and show you
some fun stuff I have been

00:00:08.167 --> 00:00:10.916
hacking on for the past three
years.

00:00:10.916 --> 00:00:15.392
This has to do with 6.002 and
circuits and all that stuff,

00:00:15.392 --> 00:00:19.162
but this is completely
optional, this is for fun,

00:00:19.162 --> 00:00:23.560
this is to go build your
intuition, this is to check your

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:28.036
answers, whatever you want.
This is not a required part of

00:00:28.036 --> 00:00:31.040
the course.
Just for fun.

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:34.800
There is this URL out here that
I put down here.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.520
I have been hacking on this
system for the past three years,

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:44.000
and for the first time this
year and very tentatively and

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.800
gingerly introducing it to
students.

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.280
The idea here is that it is a,
that is kind of defocused.

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:56.000
Any chance of focusing that a
little bit better?

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.299
The idea of this is that it is
a Web-based interactive

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:12.900
simulation package that I have
pulled together.

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:18.700
And what you can do is you can
pull up a bunch of circuits.

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.299
Notice that the URL is up here.
It is

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:29.000
euryale.lcs.mit.edu/websim.
And there is the pointer to it.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.367
So you have a bunch of fun
things you can play with.

00:01:33.367 --> 00:01:38.077
And we have gone through all of
these things in lecture.

00:01:38.077 --> 00:01:40.732
Let's pick the MOSFET
amplifier.

00:01:40.732 --> 00:01:45.270
You come to this page.
This is something you have seen

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.696
in class.
And let's play with this little

00:01:48.696 --> 00:01:51.265
circuit.
And you see the mouse?

00:01:51.265 --> 00:01:53.834
Good.
You can set up a bunch of

00:01:53.834 --> 00:01:56.917
parameters.
You can set up the MOSFET

00:01:56.917 --> 00:02:02.051
parameters VT and K.
You can set up the value of R

00:02:02.051 --> 00:02:05.023
for your resistor,
you can establish a bias

00:02:05.023 --> 00:02:08.278
voltage, and you can have an
input voltage vIN.

00:02:08.278 --> 00:02:11.250
So you can apply a bunch of
input voltages.

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.150
You can apply a zero input,
unit in pulse,

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.556
unit step, sine wave,
square waves.

00:02:16.556 --> 00:02:20.660
Or this was the part that took
me the longest to get right.

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.136
You can also input a bunch of
music.

00:02:23.136 --> 00:02:27.099
And so far I just have two
clips, so you are going to get

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:30.309
bored listening to them.
Good.

00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:33.898
So you can also input music.
And what you can do is you can

00:02:33.898 --> 00:02:36.868
watch the waveforms,
you can listen to the output

00:02:36.868 --> 00:02:40.518
and do a bunch of fun stuff.
One experiment I would love for

00:02:40.518 --> 00:02:42.746
you guys to try out.
Again, remember,

00:02:42.746 --> 00:02:45.283
this is completely optional.
Just for fun.

00:02:45.283 --> 00:02:48.315
You can apply some input.
Step input, for example,

00:02:48.315 --> 00:02:51.842
to an RLC circuit and spend 30
seconds thinking about what

00:02:51.842 --> 00:02:55.493
should the output look like.
I divine that the output should

00:02:55.493 --> 00:02:59.329
look like this and then do this
and see if what you thought was

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:03.465
correct.
And it's fun to kind of play

00:03:03.465 --> 00:03:06.371
around with it.
Let me start with,

00:03:06.371 --> 00:03:10.421
just as an example,
let's say I input classical

00:03:10.421 --> 00:03:13.591
music.
And let us say I would like to

00:03:13.591 --> 00:03:18.610
listen to the output here that
is the voltage at the drain

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:22.924
terminal of the MOSFET.
For listening it sets up a

00:03:22.924 --> 00:03:29.000
default timeframe to listen to,
so you go ahead and do it.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.703
This shows you the time domain
waveform of a clip of the music

00:03:33.703 --> 00:03:37.559
and then you can listen to it.
Lot's of distortion,

00:03:37.559 --> 00:03:39.179
right?
As you can see,

00:03:39.179 --> 00:03:43.497
there is a bunch of distortion.
And that is as you expect

00:03:43.497 --> 00:03:48.047
because the peak-to-peak voltage
is 1 volt, the bias is 2.5,

00:03:48.047 --> 00:03:52.597
and so this is clipping at the
lower end, plus the MOSFET is

00:03:52.597 --> 00:03:55.373
nonlinear.
You can play around with a

00:03:55.373 --> 00:04:00.000
bunch of things and you can have
a lot of fun.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.040
And the reason I created this
is that MIT is putting a bunch

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.874
of its courses on the Web.
And one of the hottest things

00:04:05.874 --> 00:04:08.141
about courses like this is the
lab component.

00:04:08.141 --> 00:04:11.233
If you are beaming a course to,
say, a Third World country or

00:04:11.233 --> 00:04:14.170
something, how do you get people
to set up the massive lab

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:15.974
infrastructure?
I know you hate your

00:04:15.974 --> 00:04:18.086
oscilloscopes,
I know you hate your wires,

00:04:18.086 --> 00:04:20.972
I know you hate the clips,
but the fact is you have them.

00:04:20.972 --> 00:04:23.909
I know a lot of places those
are way too expensive to pull

00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:26.847
together, which is why I have
been creating this Web-based

00:04:26.847 --> 00:04:29.887
kind of interactive laboratory
so that people can learn this

00:04:29.887 --> 00:04:34.403
stuff over the Web.
Let's go do another example

00:04:34.403 --> 00:04:38.053
very quickly.
Let's say you learned about,

00:04:38.053 --> 00:04:42.504
well, let's do RC circuits.
Here is the parallel RC

00:04:42.504 --> 00:04:45.709
circuit.
And you can set up capacitor

00:04:45.709 --> 00:04:49.715
values, resistor values,
you can set up input.

00:04:49.715 --> 00:04:55.056
Here, let me look at the time
domain waveform for the voltage

00:04:55.056 --> 00:04:59.329
across the capacitor.
And this time around let me

00:04:59.329 --> 00:05:04.374
play a unit step.
And let's see what the output

00:05:04.374 --> 00:05:08.385
is going to look like.
You can think in your minds

00:05:08.385 --> 00:05:12.970
what should the output look
like, and then you can go and

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:14.690
plot it.
There you go.

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:17.391
That's what the output looks
like.

00:05:17.391 --> 00:05:20.912
So you can play around with it
and have fun.

00:05:20.912 --> 00:05:25.333
That's all the good news.
The bad news is that so far I

00:05:25.333 --> 00:05:30.000
just have one Pentium III
machine behind us.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
It is a Linux box,
so don't all of you try it at

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.297
once.
However, what I have also done,

00:05:35.297 --> 00:05:39.000
and that took me another six
months of hacking in the small

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
amount of time professors have
to hack on stuff,

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.638
I've hacked an incredibly
elaborate cashing system so that

00:05:45.638 --> 00:05:49.468
once anyone in class tries out
some combination of parameters

00:05:49.468 --> 00:05:52.148
it goes and squirrels away all
the outputs.

00:05:52.148 --> 00:05:55.914
If anybody else types in the
same sets of parameters it will

00:05:55.914 --> 00:06:00.000
just get all the output and play
it back to you.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.057
So if enough of you play with
over time, we may end up cashing

00:06:04.057 --> 00:06:07.915
all the important waveforms and
music clips and all of that

00:06:07.915 --> 00:06:09.778
stuff.
I have allocated a few

00:06:09.778 --> 00:06:12.904
gigabytes of storage,
so I am hoping that it may

00:06:12.904 --> 00:06:13.835
work.
Go forth.

00:06:13.835 --> 00:06:16.363
Play with it.
And this is completely my

00:06:16.363 --> 00:06:20.554
fault, so if there are any bugs
or anything simply email them to

00:06:20.554 --> 00:06:22.749
me.
This is the first time this is

00:06:22.749 --> 00:06:26.607
coming alive so bear with it.
Now let me switch back to the

00:06:26.607 --> 00:06:30.000
scheduled presentation for
today.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.934
All right, hope and pray that
this works.

00:07:13.934 --> 00:07:14.819
Yes.
Good.

00:07:14.819 --> 00:07:19.737
I am going to do today's
lecture using view graphs.

00:07:19.737 --> 00:07:25.147
And the reason I am going to do
that and not do my usual

00:07:25.147 --> 00:07:31.147
blackboard presentation which I
way, way, way prefer to a view

00:07:31.147 --> 00:07:35.799
graph presentation.
The only reason I am going to

00:07:35.799 --> 00:07:38.591
do this for today,
and maybe one more lecture,

00:07:38.591 --> 00:07:42.128
is that there is just a huge
amount of math grunge in this

00:07:42.128 --> 00:07:44.362
lecture.
What I want to do is kind of

00:07:44.362 --> 00:07:47.465
blast through that,
but you will have it all in the

00:07:47.465 --> 00:07:50.630
notes that you have,
so that you don't waste time in

00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:54.539
class as you watch me stumbling
over twiddles and tildes and all

00:07:54.539 --> 00:07:57.083
that stuff.
The key thing here is that the

00:07:57.083 --> 00:08:01.840
insight is actually very simple.
The beginning and the end are

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:04.251
connected very tightly and very
simple.

00:08:04.251 --> 00:08:08.186
There is a bunch of math grunge
in the middle that we are going

00:08:08.186 --> 00:08:11.296
to work through and,
again, follows a complete old

00:08:11.296 --> 00:08:13.707
established pattern.
So, in that sense,

00:08:13.707 --> 00:08:16.817
there is really nothing
dramatically new in there.

00:08:16.817 --> 00:08:20.498
Let me spend the next five
minutes reviewing for you how we

00:08:20.498 --> 00:08:23.734
got here, what have we covered
so far and set up the

00:08:23.734 --> 00:08:26.463
presentation.
The first ten view graphs I am

00:08:26.463 --> 00:08:30.334
going to blast through and just
tell you where we are in terms

00:08:30.334 --> 00:08:35.575
of LC and RLC circuits.
I began by showing you this

00:08:35.575 --> 00:08:39.296
little demo, two inverters,
one driving.

00:08:39.296 --> 00:08:44.448
I can model the inductance here
with a little inductor,

00:08:44.448 --> 00:08:50.173
the capacitor of the gate here.
And recall that when I wanted

00:08:50.173 --> 00:08:55.802
to speed this up by introducing
a 50 ohm smaller resistance,

00:08:55.802 --> 00:09:00.000
I got some really strange
behavior.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.164
Just to remind you,
for Tuesday's lecture it would

00:09:04.164 --> 00:09:09.433
help if you quickly reviewed the
appendix on complex algebra in

00:09:09.433 --> 00:09:13.002
the course notes.
Remember all the real and

00:09:13.002 --> 00:09:17.422
imaginary j and omega stuff?
It would be good to very

00:09:17.422 --> 00:09:21.671
quickly skim through that.
It is a couple of pages.

00:09:21.671 --> 00:09:25.750
Remember this demo?
And the relevant circuit that

00:09:25.750 --> 00:09:30.000
is of interest to us is this one
here.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.468
It is the resistor,
there is the inductor and there

00:09:33.468 --> 00:09:35.550
is a capacitor.
This is Page 3.

00:09:35.550 --> 00:09:39.019
I am just going to blast
through the first ten view

00:09:39.019 --> 00:09:40.892
graphs.
It is all old stuff.

00:09:40.892 --> 00:09:43.459
Then we observed the following
output.

00:09:43.459 --> 00:09:46.928
We applied this input at VA and
we got this output,

00:09:46.928 --> 00:09:50.882
a very slowly rising waveform
because of the RC transient.

00:09:50.882 --> 00:09:53.311
And because of that you saw a
delay.

00:09:53.311 --> 00:09:57.057
Notice that this delay was
because of the slowly rising

00:09:57.057 --> 00:10:01.112
transient.
This waveform took some time to

00:10:01.112 --> 00:10:04.314
hit the threshold of the
neighboring transistor.

00:10:04.314 --> 00:10:07.448
So we say ah-ha,
let's try to speed this sucker

00:10:07.448 --> 00:10:11.399
up by reducing the resistance in
the collector of the first

00:10:11.399 --> 00:10:13.648
inverter.
And so I had this input.

00:10:13.648 --> 00:10:17.123
Now, to my surprise,
instead of seeing a nice little

00:10:17.123 --> 00:10:20.461
much higher and much faster
transitioning circuit,

00:10:20.461 --> 00:10:24.549
well, I did see a much faster
transitioning circuit but I got

00:10:24.549 --> 00:10:30.000
all this strange behavior on the
output that I was interested in.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.334
And because of that,
if these excursions were low

00:10:33.334 --> 00:10:37.781
enough, I could actually trigger
the output and get a whole bunch

00:10:37.781 --> 00:10:41.950
of false ones here because of
these negative excursions which

00:10:41.950 --> 00:10:45.563
should not really be there.
That was kind of strange.

00:10:45.563 --> 00:10:49.454
In the last lecture we said
let's take this one step at a

00:10:49.454 --> 00:10:51.607
time.
Let's not jump into an RLC

00:10:51.607 --> 00:10:53.692
circuit.
Let's go step by step.

00:10:53.692 --> 00:10:58.000
Let's start with an LC,
understand the behavior.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.431
We started off with an LC
circuit of this sort,

00:11:01.431 --> 00:11:05.459
and using the node equation we
showed that this was the

00:11:05.459 --> 00:11:09.188
equation that governed the
behavior of the circuit.

00:11:09.188 --> 00:11:13.515
And then we said that for a
step input and for zero initial

00:11:13.515 --> 00:11:16.722
conditions, that is the zero
state response,

00:11:16.722 --> 00:11:20.675
let's find out what the output,
the voltage across the

00:11:20.675 --> 00:11:24.331
capacitor looks like.
And so we obtained the total

00:11:24.331 --> 00:11:28.135
solution to be this.
And there was a sinusoidal term

00:11:28.135 --> 00:11:32.290
in there.
And the omega nought which was

00:11:32.290 --> 00:11:36.106
one by square root of LC.
And this was the circuit.

00:11:36.106 --> 00:11:40.305
And so for this step input
notice that the output looked

00:11:40.305 --> 00:11:43.282
like this.
So far an input step I had an

00:11:43.282 --> 00:11:47.175
output that went like this.
Notice that it is indeed

00:11:47.175 --> 00:11:51.832
possible for the output voltage
to actually go above the input

00:11:51.832 --> 00:11:54.732
value VI.
This is kind of non-intuitive

00:11:54.732 --> 00:11:58.473
but this can happen.
So this waveform jumps up and

00:11:58.473 --> 00:12:01.848
down.
But the steady state value,

00:12:01.848 --> 00:12:03.833
on average if you will,
is VI.

00:12:03.833 --> 00:12:06.640
On the other hand,
it does have sinusoidal

00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:10.885
excursions and this kind of goes
on because there is nothing to

00:12:10.885 --> 00:12:13.623
dissipate the energy inside that
circuit.

00:12:13.623 --> 00:12:17.662
By the way, the fact that the
capacitor voltage shoots above

00:12:17.662 --> 00:12:21.427
the input voltage is actually a
very important property.

00:12:21.427 --> 00:12:25.535
We won't dwell on it in 6.002,
but just squirrel that away in

00:12:25.535 --> 00:12:30.165
your brain somewhere.
I promise you that some time in

00:12:30.165 --> 00:12:34.218
your life you will have to
create a little design somewhere

00:12:34.218 --> 00:12:37.711
that will need a higher voltage
than your DC input.

00:12:37.711 --> 00:12:41.834
And you can use this primitive
fact to actually produce a DC

00:12:41.834 --> 00:12:45.397
voltage higher than you are
given, and then use that

00:12:45.397 --> 00:12:47.703
somehow.
In fact, there is a whole

00:12:47.703 --> 00:12:51.336
research area of what are called
DC to DC converters,

00:12:51.336 --> 00:12:54.550
voltage converters.
Let's say you have 1.5 volt

00:12:54.550 --> 00:12:58.113
battery, a AA battery,
but let's say a circuit needs

00:12:58.113 --> 00:13:01.149
1.8 volts.
The Pentium IIIs,

00:13:01.149 --> 00:13:03.109
for example,
needed 1.8 volts.

00:13:03.109 --> 00:13:07.097
And the strong arm is another
chip that required 1.8 volts a

00:13:07.097 --> 00:13:10.072
few years ago,
but the AA cell was 1.5 volts.

00:13:10.072 --> 00:13:13.587
How do get 1.8 from 1.5?
Well, you have to step it up

00:13:13.587 --> 00:13:16.156
somehow.
And this basic principle where

00:13:16.156 --> 00:13:19.941
the voltage can jump up above
the input is actually used,

00:13:19.941 --> 00:13:23.794
of course with additional
circuitry, to kind of get higher

00:13:23.794 --> 00:13:26.363
voltages.
It is a really key point that

00:13:26.363 --> 00:13:31.316
you can squirrel away.
This was pretty much where we

00:13:31.316 --> 00:13:35.710
got to in the last lecture.
This starts off the material

00:13:35.710 --> 00:13:38.986
for today.
What we are going to do is take

00:13:38.986 --> 00:13:42.900
that same circuit,
but instead we are going to put

00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:47.294
in this little resistor here.
This is what we set out to

00:13:47.294 --> 00:13:50.170
analyze.
And for details you can read

00:13:50.170 --> 00:13:54.804
the course notes Section 13.6.
The green curve here was the

00:13:54.804 --> 00:14:00.163
behavior of the LC circuit.
And what we are going to show

00:14:00.163 --> 00:14:04.414
today is that the moment we
introduce R this sinusoid here

00:14:04.414 --> 00:14:06.951
gets damp.
It kind of loses energy.

00:14:06.951 --> 00:14:11.426
And I am going to show you that
the behavior is going to look

00:14:11.426 --> 00:14:14.037
like this.
By introducing R this guy

00:14:14.037 --> 00:14:16.424
doesn't keep oscillating
forever.

00:14:16.424 --> 00:14:20.750
Rather it begins to oscillate
and then kind of loses energy

00:14:20.750 --> 00:14:24.107
and kind of gets tired and
settles down at VI.

00:14:24.107 --> 00:14:28.060
And remember the demo.
This is exactly what you saw in

00:14:28.060 --> 00:14:32.067
the demo.
You had a step input and you

00:14:32.067 --> 00:14:36.128
had this funny behavior.
And for the RLC that is exactly

00:14:36.128 --> 00:14:39.156
what it was.
So today's lecture will close

00:14:39.156 --> 00:14:43.512
the loop on what you saw in the
demo and the weird behavior,

00:14:43.512 --> 00:14:48.090
and I am going to show you the
mathematics foundations for that

00:14:48.090 --> 00:14:50.748
today.
Let's go ahead and analyze the

00:14:50.748 --> 00:14:53.850
RLC circuit.
I purposely created the entire

00:14:53.850 --> 00:14:57.763
presentation to follow as
closely as possible both the

00:14:57.763 --> 00:15:02.194
discussion of the RC networks
and the LC networks so that the

00:15:02.194 --> 00:15:06.858
math is all the same.
Exactly the same steps in the

00:15:06.858 --> 00:15:10.000
mathematics are in the
exposition of the analysis.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.461
What's different are the
results because the circuit is

00:15:13.461 --> 00:15:15.833
different.
So don't get bogged down or

00:15:15.833 --> 00:15:19.423
whatever in the mathematics.
Just remember it is the same

00:15:19.423 --> 00:15:22.371
set of steps that you are going
to be applying.

00:15:22.371 --> 00:15:26.153
We start by writing down the
element rules for our elements.

00:15:26.153 --> 00:15:30.000
Nothing new here.
For the inductor V is Ldi/dt.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.925
The integral form which is
simply 1/L integral vLdt=i.

00:15:33.925 --> 00:15:37.481
We saw this the last time.
And for the capacitor,

00:15:37.481 --> 00:15:41.185
the current through the
capacitor is simply Cdv/dt.

00:15:41.185 --> 00:15:45.777
Those are the two element rules
for the capacitor and inductor.

00:15:45.777 --> 00:15:49.037
The element rule for the
resistor, of course,

00:15:49.037 --> 00:15:50.666
is V=iR.
You know that.

00:15:50.666 --> 00:15:53.925
And for the voltage source we
know that, too,

00:15:53.925 --> 00:15:57.333
the voltage is a constant.
Just follow the same

00:15:57.333 --> 00:16:02.629
established pattern.
By the way, just so you are

00:16:02.629 --> 00:16:08.376
aware, I have booby trapped the
presentation a little bit to

00:16:08.376 --> 00:16:14.220
prevent you from falling asleep.
You see the dash lines here?

00:16:14.220 --> 00:16:19.870
Whenever you see a dash line,
that stuff needs to be copied

00:16:19.870 --> 00:16:22.402
down.
Don't trip over that.

00:16:22.402 --> 00:16:27.759
Don't say I didn't warn you.
We start by using the usual

00:16:27.759 --> 00:16:31.995
node method.
And I have two nodes in this

00:16:31.995 --> 00:16:33.990
case.
Unlike the LC circuits,

00:16:33.990 --> 00:16:37.909
I have two unknown nodes.
One is this node here with the

00:16:37.909 --> 00:16:42.114
node voltage vA and the second
node is the node with voltage

00:16:42.114 --> 00:16:44.465
vT.
Let me start with vA and write

00:16:44.465 --> 00:16:47.600
the node equation for that.
It is simply 1/L,

00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:51.448
the node equation for this is
the current going in this

00:16:51.448 --> 00:16:55.653
direction with is vI-vA integral
and that equals the current

00:16:55.653 --> 00:17:00.000
going this way which is vA-v/R,
node equation.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.420
I then write the node equation
for the node v,

00:17:03.420 --> 00:17:06.232
for this node here,
and that is simply

00:17:06.232 --> 00:17:09.577
(vA-v)/R=Cdvdt.
And that is what I have here,

00:17:09.577 --> 00:17:13.149
two node equations.
Let me summarize the results

00:17:13.149 --> 00:17:17.938
for you and then show you a view
graph where I grind through the

00:17:17.938 --> 00:17:22.574
math as to how I got the result.
Here is the result I am going

00:17:22.574 --> 00:17:24.931
to get.
If I take these two node

00:17:24.931 --> 00:17:28.503
equations and I massage some of
the mathematics,

00:17:28.503 --> 00:17:34.453
I am going to get this result.
And I will show you that in a

00:17:34.453 --> 00:17:37.498
second.
By grinding through some math

00:17:37.498 --> 00:17:42.743
and solving these two equations
and expressing this in terms of

00:17:42.743 --> 00:17:46.549
v, I get a second order
differential equation,

00:17:46.549 --> 00:17:48.326
d^2v blah, blah,
blah.

00:17:48.326 --> 00:17:52.894
Notice that this is different
from the LC in this term.

00:17:52.894 --> 00:17:57.969
Every step of the way you can
check to see if I am lying or I

00:17:57.969 --> 00:18:01.252
am correct.
I will indulge you,

00:18:01.252 --> 00:18:04.285
indulge myself rather with a
little story here.

00:18:04.285 --> 00:18:06.725
Richard Fineman was a known
smart guy.

00:18:06.725 --> 00:18:10.615
And one of the reasons that he
was that was in the middle of

00:18:10.615 --> 00:18:14.373
talks he was known to get up and
ask some of the darndest,

00:18:14.373 --> 00:18:17.934
hardest questions and say
ah-ha, you have a bug in this

00:18:17.934 --> 00:18:21.494
proof here or a bug in this
equation that is not right.

00:18:21.494 --> 00:18:23.538
And usually he would be
correct.

00:18:23.538 --> 00:18:27.230
So his trick in doing this and
which is one reason how he

00:18:27.230 --> 00:18:31.065
became a known smart guy.
What he would do is,

00:18:31.065 --> 00:18:34.209
as the speaker went on talking
he would kind of follow along

00:18:34.209 --> 00:18:36.554
and think of a simple initial
primitive case.

00:18:36.554 --> 00:18:38.419
In this case,
I have an RLC circuit.

00:18:38.419 --> 00:18:40.230
So think of a simpler case of
this.

00:18:40.230 --> 00:18:43.428
A simpler case of this is R=0.
Whenever you set R to be zero,

00:18:43.428 --> 00:18:46.305
you should get exactly what we
got in the last lecture,

00:18:46.305 --> 00:18:48.330
correct?
That is what Fineman would do.

00:18:48.330 --> 00:18:50.515
He would boil this down to a
simpler case,

00:18:50.515 --> 00:18:52.806
make some assumptions and just
follow along.

00:18:52.806 --> 00:18:55.523
And whenever he found a
discrepancy between the math

00:18:55.523 --> 00:18:57.655
here and his simple case he
would say oh,

00:18:57.655 --> 00:19:02.000
there is a bug there.
If you want you can catch me

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.785
that way.
Here, what Fineman would do is

00:19:04.785 --> 00:19:08.357
replace R being zero,
and notice then this equation

00:19:08.357 --> 00:19:12.571
here is exactly what we got the
last time with R being zero.

00:19:12.571 --> 00:19:14.857
Just remember that Fineman
trick.

00:19:14.857 --> 00:19:18.928
This is the equation we get,
the second-order differential

00:19:18.928 --> 00:19:21.214
equation with an R term in
there.

00:19:21.214 --> 00:19:25.500
And let me just grind through
the math and show you how I got

00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:28.357
this from this.
So the two node equations

00:19:28.357 --> 00:19:32.945
again.
And what I do is I start by

00:19:32.945 --> 00:19:38.945
taking these two equations and
differentiating this with

00:19:38.945 --> 00:19:42.763
respect to t and this is what I
get.

00:19:42.763 --> 00:19:48.327
And, at the same time,
I have replaced (vA-v)/R here

00:19:48.327 --> 00:19:52.799
by this term.
I replace this with this and

00:19:52.799 --> 00:19:57.599
differentiate.
Then I simply divide the whole

00:19:57.599 --> 00:20:02.509
thing by C.
Then I take this expression

00:20:02.509 --> 00:20:07.157
here and write down vA is equal
to this stuff here.

00:20:07.157 --> 00:20:12.642
Next I am going to substitute
this back for vA and eliminate

00:20:12.642 --> 00:20:14.594
vA.
So I take this vA,

00:20:14.594 --> 00:20:19.521
stick the sucker in here,
and thereby eliminate vA and

00:20:19.521 --> 00:20:23.239
get this.
And then I simplify it and here

00:20:23.239 --> 00:20:26.307
is what I get.
That is what I get.

00:20:26.307 --> 00:20:33.000
I just grind through the two
equations and get that result.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:36.651
So like a stuck record I will
repeat our mantra here,

00:20:36.651 --> 00:20:40.934
which is here is how we solve
the equations that we run across

00:20:40.934 --> 00:20:43.462
in this course,
the same three steps.

00:20:43.462 --> 00:20:47.535
Find the particular solution.
Find the homogenous solution.

00:20:47.535 --> 00:20:51.467
Find the total solution and
then find the constants using

00:20:51.467 --> 00:20:53.854
the initial conditions.
Same steps.

00:20:53.854 --> 00:20:56.312
You could recite this in your
sleep.

00:20:56.312 --> 00:21:00.455
And the homogenous solution is
obtained using a further four

00:21:00.455 --> 00:21:04.167
steps.
Let's just go through and apply

00:21:04.167 --> 00:21:07.454
this method to our equation and
get the results.

00:21:07.454 --> 00:21:11.720
vP is a particular solution and
vH is the homogenous solution.

00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:13.818
With a particular solution,
oh.

00:21:13.818 --> 00:21:17.734
Before I go on to do that,
let me set up my inputs and my

00:21:17.734 --> 00:21:21.020
state variables.
My input is going to be a step.

00:21:21.020 --> 00:21:25.216
Remember, I am trying to take
you to the point where the demo

00:21:25.216 --> 00:21:27.664
left off.
The demo had a step input,

00:21:27.664 --> 00:21:32.000
so I am going to use a step
input rising to vI.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:36.421
And I am going to with the
initial conditions being all

00:21:36.421 --> 00:21:39.122
zeros.
So the capacitor voltage is

00:21:39.122 --> 00:21:43.461
zero, inductor current,
another state variable is also

00:21:43.461 --> 00:21:48.374
zero, and therefore this is also
fondly called the ZSR or the

00:21:48.374 --> 00:21:53.122
zero state response because
there is only an input but zero

00:21:53.122 --> 00:21:55.742
state.
Again, remember the dashed

00:21:55.742 --> 00:22:00.000
lines here.
Don't say I didn't warn you.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:02.179
Let's start with a particular
solution.

00:22:02.179 --> 00:22:05.162
This is as simple as it gets.
I simply write down the

00:22:05.162 --> 00:22:07.858
particular equation and stick my
specific input.

00:22:07.858 --> 00:22:11.185
And remember the solution to
the particular equation is any

00:22:11.185 --> 00:22:13.709
old solution,
it doesn't have to be a general

00:22:13.709 --> 00:22:16.233
solution, any old solution that
satisfies it.

00:22:16.233 --> 00:22:18.814
And I am going to find a simple
solution here.

00:22:18.814 --> 00:22:20.707
And V particular is a constant
VI.

00:22:20.707 --> 00:22:22.944
It works.
Because remember this has been

00:22:22.944 --> 00:22:25.697
working all along.
And I am going to keep pushing

00:22:25.697 --> 00:22:30.000
this and see if this works until
the end of the course.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:31.403
Guess what?
It will.

00:22:31.403 --> 00:22:33.694
So this is a solution.
I'm done.

00:22:33.694 --> 00:22:36.502
That is my particular solution.
Simple.

00:22:36.502 --> 00:22:39.605
Second, I go and do my
homogenous solution.

00:22:39.605 --> 00:22:43.522
And the homogenous equation,
remember, is the same old

00:22:43.522 --> 00:22:47.068
differential equation with the
drive set to zero.

00:22:47.068 --> 00:22:51.354
Remember that sometimes this
equation with the drive set to

00:22:51.354 --> 00:22:55.935
zero is the entire equation you
have to deal with in situations

00:22:55.935 --> 00:23:00.000
where you have zero input,
for example.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:03.816
Or in other situations in which
you have an impulse at the

00:23:03.816 --> 00:23:06.227
input.
And the impulse simply sets up

00:23:06.227 --> 00:23:09.910
the initial conditions like a
charge in the capacitor or

00:23:09.910 --> 00:23:12.857
something like that.
So we are going to blast

00:23:12.857 --> 00:23:16.674
through this four-step method.
The method simply says that

00:23:16.674 --> 00:23:20.758
four steps, I am going to assume
a solution of the form Ae^st.

00:23:20.758 --> 00:23:23.772
And if you think you've seen
that before, yes,

00:23:23.772 --> 00:23:26.049
you have seen it many times
before.

00:23:26.049 --> 00:23:30.000
And you will see it again,
again and again.

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:34.248
And we need to find A and s.
We want to form the

00:23:34.248 --> 00:23:39.129
characteristic equation,
find the roots of the equation

00:23:39.129 --> 00:23:44.282
and then write down the general
solution to the homogenous

00:23:44.282 --> 00:23:47.446
equation as this.
Same old same old.

00:23:47.446 --> 00:23:50.971
Let me just walk through the
steps here.

00:23:50.971 --> 00:23:54.858
Step A, assume a solution to
the form Ae^st.

00:23:54.858 --> 00:23:59.920
And so I substitute Ae^st as my
tentative solution to the

00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:04.163
equation.
Again, let me remind you that

00:24:04.163 --> 00:24:08.638
the differential equations that
we solve here are really easy

00:24:08.638 --> 00:24:12.965
because the way you solve them
is you begin by assuming you

00:24:12.965 --> 00:24:17.365
know the solution and stick it
in and find out what makes it

00:24:17.365 --> 00:24:19.976
work.
I am going to stick Ae^st into

00:24:19.976 --> 00:24:23.557
this differential equation,
and A comes out here.

00:24:23.557 --> 00:24:27.659
Differentiate this d squared,
I get s squared down here,

00:24:27.659 --> 00:24:31.986
A s here and this simply gets
stuck down here with the 1/LC

00:24:31.986 --> 00:24:35.838
coefficient.
The next step I begin

00:24:35.838 --> 00:24:39.865
eliminating what I can,
so I eliminate the A's,

00:24:39.865 --> 00:24:44.855
then eliminate the e^st's,
and I end up with this equation

00:24:44.855 --> 00:24:47.744
here.
I end up with this equation.

00:24:47.744 --> 00:24:50.720
This is my characteristic
equation.

00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:54.659
It is an equation in s.
Do people remember the

00:24:54.659 --> 00:25:00.000
characteristic equation we got
for the LC circuit?

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:03.167
Remember the Fineman trick?
That's right,

00:25:03.167 --> 00:25:04.276
LC.
S^2+1/LC=0.

00:25:04.276 --> 00:25:08.631
This thing wasn't there.
All you do is simply follow the

00:25:08.631 --> 00:25:10.214
R.
Just follow the R.

00:25:10.214 --> 00:25:14.649
Just imagine this is a dollar
sign and kind of follow it.

00:25:14.649 --> 00:25:19.004
And you will see what the
differences are between the LC

00:25:19.004 --> 00:25:22.251
and the RLC.
So this is the characteristic

00:25:22.251 --> 00:25:24.705
equation.
What I am going to do,

00:25:24.705 --> 00:25:28.981
iss much as I wrote the
characteristic equation for the

00:25:28.981 --> 00:25:35.000
LC circuit, by substituting
omega nought squared for 1/LC.

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:39.461
Let me do the same thing here
but introduce something for R

00:25:39.461 --> 00:25:42.769
and L as well.
What I will do is let me give

00:25:42.769 --> 00:25:46.538
you this canonic form.
The very first second-order

00:25:46.538 --> 00:25:50.692
equation I learned about when I
was a kid was this one,

00:25:50.692 --> 00:25:53.307
S^2+2AS+B^2 or something like
that.

00:25:53.307 --> 00:25:57.923
Let me write it in that form
where I get 2 alpha s plus omega

00:25:57.923 --> 00:26:02.866
nought squared.
Again, remember the alpha comes

00:26:02.866 --> 00:26:07.489
about because of R.
So omega nought squared is 1/LC

00:26:07.489 --> 00:26:11.743
and alpha is RL/2.
Omega nought squared is 1/LC

00:26:11.743 --> 00:26:17.013
and R/L is equal to two alpha.
I am just writing this in a

00:26:17.013 --> 00:26:22.931
simpler form so that from now on
going forward I am just going to

00:26:22.931 --> 00:26:27.000
deal with alphas and omega
noughts.

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:29.582
Once I get to this
characteristic equation,

00:26:29.582 --> 00:26:32.963
after that I can give you one
generic way of solving it.

00:26:32.963 --> 00:26:35.730
And depending on the kind of
circuit you have,

00:26:35.730 --> 00:26:37.882
a series RLC,
which is what we have,

00:26:37.882 --> 00:26:40.649
or a parallel RLC we will
simply get different

00:26:40.649 --> 00:26:44.461
coefficients for the alpha term.
This is going to stay the same

00:26:44.461 --> 00:26:47.596
but this term will look
different, alpha is going to

00:26:47.596 --> 00:26:50.301
look different.
There is a real pattern here.

00:26:50.301 --> 00:26:53.929
And what I am doing is simply
focusing on what is important,

00:26:53.929 --> 00:26:56.634
what the differences are
between the pattern.

00:26:56.634 --> 00:27:01.000
You learned the LC situation
and the RLC situation.

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:04.632
Given this I can now write
down, I am just simply replacing

00:27:04.632 --> 00:27:08.139
this as my characteristic
equation in dealing with alphas

00:27:08.139 --> 00:27:10.457
and omegas.
I will give you a physical

00:27:10.457 --> 00:27:12.774
significance of alpha in a
little bit.

00:27:12.774 --> 00:27:16.344
Do you remember the physical
significance of omega nought?

00:27:16.344 --> 00:27:18.473
That was the oscillation
frequency.

00:27:18.473 --> 00:27:20.728
In other words,
given an inductor and

00:27:20.728 --> 00:27:24.486
capacitor, you put some charge
on the capacitor and you watch

00:27:24.486 --> 00:27:27.680
it, it will oscillate.
And its oscillation frequency

00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:31.000
will be one by a square root of
LC.

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:35.617
The magnitude of the initial
conditions will determine how

00:27:35.617 --> 00:27:40.234
high are the oscillations or
what the phase is in terms of

00:27:40.234 --> 00:27:43.798
when it starts,
but the frequency is going to

00:27:43.798 --> 00:27:46.715
be the same.
Step three, to solve the

00:27:46.715 --> 00:27:50.279
homogenous equation,
is find the roots of the

00:27:50.279 --> 00:27:53.681
equation, s1 and s2,
and here are my roots.

00:27:53.681 --> 00:27:56.354
Good old roots for a
second-order,

00:27:56.354 --> 00:28:02.255
little s squared equation here.
Finally, given that I have the

00:28:02.255 --> 00:28:06.390
roots, I can write down the
general homogenous solution.

00:28:06.390 --> 00:28:09.849
So general solution is simply
A1e^s1t, A2e^s2t.

00:28:09.849 --> 00:28:12.105
That's it.
That's the solution.

00:28:12.105 --> 00:28:16.165
This looks big and corny,
but we are going to make some

00:28:16.165 --> 00:28:20.827
simplifications as we go along
and show that it ends up boiling

00:28:20.827 --> 00:28:25.187
down to something cos omega t.
The math is kind of involved

00:28:25.187 --> 00:28:30.000
but we get down to something
very simple, a cosine.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:34.559
Hold this general solution.
From that, as a step three of

00:28:34.559 --> 00:28:38.793
the differential equation
solution, I write the total

00:28:38.793 --> 00:28:42.213
solution down.
And my total solution is the

00:28:42.213 --> 00:28:47.017
sum of the particular and the
homogenous, so therefore I get

00:28:47.017 --> 00:28:49.786
this.
VI was my particular and this

00:28:49.786 --> 00:28:52.636
term here is my homogenous
solution.

00:28:52.636 --> 00:28:57.684
Now, if I wasn't doing circuits
and simply trying to solve this

00:28:57.684 --> 00:29:02.000
mathematically here is what I
would do.

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:06.011
I would find the unknown from
the initial conditions,

00:29:06.011 --> 00:29:09.327
so I know that v(0)=0.
And so therefore if I

00:29:09.327 --> 00:29:12.027
substitute zero for V(0) I get
this.

00:29:12.027 --> 00:29:15.190
If I substitute zero here,
t is 0, t is 0,

00:29:15.190 --> 00:29:19.355
so I simply get V1+A1+A2.
And let me just blast through

00:29:19.355 --> 00:29:22.672
because I am going to redo this
differently.

00:29:22.672 --> 00:29:25.294
i=Cdv/dt.
And so that's what I get.

00:29:25.294 --> 00:29:30.000
I substitute zero and this is
what I would get.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:32.333
I hurried through this.
Don't worry.

00:29:32.333 --> 00:29:35.133
I'm going to do it again.
If you just do it

00:29:35.133 --> 00:29:37.933
mathematically,
you can solve this equation

00:29:37.933 --> 00:29:42.000
here and these two simultaneous
equations in a1 and a2 and get

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:44.200
the coefficients and you are
done.

00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:48.333
But it doesn't give us a whole
lot of insight into the behavior

00:29:48.333 --> 00:29:51.599
of these terms here.
What I am going to do for now

00:29:51.599 --> 00:29:55.066
is kind of ignore that.
Ignore I did that and instead

00:29:55.066 --> 00:30:00.000
try to go down a path that is a
little bit more intuitive.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:05.389
Let's stare at this expression
we got for the total solution.

00:30:05.389 --> 00:30:09.251
That is the expression we got.
All I did is,

00:30:09.251 --> 00:30:13.742
I had alpha in there,
I simply pulled out the alpha

00:30:13.742 --> 00:30:17.065
outside.
So this is my total solution,

00:30:17.065 --> 00:30:21.646
V1-A1e^(-alpha t) something
else and something else.

00:30:21.646 --> 00:30:26.586
Three cases to consider
depending on the relative values

00:30:26.586 --> 00:30:32.513
of alpha and omega nought.
If alpha is greater than omega

00:30:32.513 --> 00:30:35.698
nought then I get a real
quantity here.

00:30:35.698 --> 00:30:40.474
The square root of a positive
number, I get a real number,

00:30:40.474 --> 00:30:45.502
and that number will add up to
the minus alpha and I am going

00:30:45.502 --> 00:30:49.860
to get a solution that will look
like, oh, I'm sorry.

00:30:49.860 --> 00:30:53.044
Let me just do it a little
differently.

00:30:53.044 --> 00:30:55.642
There are three situations
here.

00:30:55.642 --> 00:31:00.000
One is alpha greater than omega
nought.

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:04.373
Alpha equal to omega nought.
Alpha less than omega nought.

00:31:04.373 --> 00:31:06.751
Alpha is greater,
alpha is less,

00:31:06.751 --> 00:31:10.971
alpha is equal to this term
inside the square root sign.

00:31:10.971 --> 00:31:14.961
For reasons you will understand
shortly, we call this

00:31:14.961 --> 00:31:18.644
"overdamped" case,
the "underdamped" case and the

00:31:18.644 --> 00:31:22.557
"critically damped" case.
When alpha is greater than

00:31:22.557 --> 00:31:26.010
omega nought this term gives me
a real number,

00:31:26.010 --> 00:31:30.000
and I get something as simple
as this.

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:33.990
Remember, for the series RLC
circuit, alpha was R/2L.

00:31:33.990 --> 00:31:36.292
So if R is big,
in other words,

00:31:36.292 --> 00:31:40.666
if in my RLC circuit R is huge
then I am going to get this

00:31:40.666 --> 00:31:43.275
situation.
My output voltage on the

00:31:43.275 --> 00:31:47.189
capacitor is going to look like
this, the sum of two

00:31:47.189 --> 00:31:50.412
exponentials.
And if I were to plot it very

00:31:50.412 --> 00:31:52.714
quickly for you,
for a VI step,

00:31:52.714 --> 00:31:56.551
V would look like this.
So v would simply look like

00:31:56.551 --> 00:32:02.000
this because it is the sum of a
couple of exponentials.

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:04.832
All right.
Now, alpha is positive here.

00:32:04.832 --> 00:32:08.113
Remember alpha1 and alpha2 are
both positive.

00:32:08.113 --> 00:32:11.616
These two added up,
because of this constant VI,

00:32:11.616 --> 00:32:15.568
give rise to something that
increases in the following

00:32:15.568 --> 00:32:18.102
manner.
Let's look at the situation

00:32:18.102 --> 00:32:22.501
where alpha is less than omega
nought, where the term inside

00:32:22.501 --> 00:32:24.886
the square root sign is
negative.

00:32:24.886 --> 00:32:29.136
What I can do is pull the
negative sign out and express it

00:32:29.136 --> 00:32:32.916
this way.
What I am going to do is since

00:32:32.916 --> 00:32:36.940
alpha is less than omega nought,
I am going to reverse these two

00:32:36.940 --> 00:32:40.262
and pull out square root of
minus one to the outside.

00:32:40.262 --> 00:32:43.328
This is what I get.
I am just playing around with

00:32:43.328 --> 00:32:47.033
this so that whatever is under
the square root sign ends up

00:32:47.033 --> 00:32:49.077
giving me a positive real
number.

00:32:49.077 --> 00:32:52.015
So I pull the j outside and
this is what I get.

00:32:52.015 --> 00:32:55.592
Now, let me blast through a
bunch of math and end up with

00:32:55.592 --> 00:32:57.828
something very,
very simple for this

00:32:57.828 --> 00:33:02.259
underdamped case.
Let me define a few other

00:33:02.259 --> 00:33:05.604
terms.
I am going to call omega nought

00:33:05.604 --> 00:33:09.491
minus alpha squared the square
root of that.

00:33:09.491 --> 00:33:14.282
I am going to call it omega d.
And here is what I get.

00:33:14.282 --> 00:33:18.711
So I have defined three things
for you now, alpha,

00:33:18.711 --> 00:33:23.322
omega nought and omega d.
And I get this equation in

00:33:23.322 --> 00:33:28.293
terms of alpha and omega d.
And then, remember from your

00:33:28.293 --> 00:33:34.107
good-old Euler relationship?
e to the j omega d is simply

00:33:34.107 --> 00:33:37.494
cosine plus a j sine.
I am just going to blast

00:33:37.494 --> 00:33:40.354
through a bunch of math rather
quickly.

00:33:40.354 --> 00:33:44.043
Once I replace this in terms of
a cosine and sine,

00:33:44.043 --> 00:33:48.258
cosine and a j sine and then
collect all the coefficients

00:33:48.258 --> 00:33:52.924
together, I get an equation of
the form VI plus some constant e

00:33:52.924 --> 00:33:56.838
to the minus alpha t,
cosine, the sum of the constant

00:33:56.838 --> 00:34:00.000
e to the minus alpha t,
sine.

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:02.823
Remember the sines and cosines
are coming out,

00:34:02.823 --> 00:34:06.212
but because of my R I am
getting this funny alpha here,

00:34:06.212 --> 00:34:09.601
e to the minus alpha here.
So I am getting sums of sine

00:34:09.601 --> 00:34:11.672
and cosine.
And K1 and K2 are some

00:34:11.672 --> 00:34:15.060
constants which I will need to
determine for my initial

00:34:15.060 --> 00:34:17.633
conditions.
I am going to continue on with

00:34:17.633 --> 00:34:21.273
this and keep on simplifying it
because, as I promised you,

00:34:21.273 --> 00:34:24.285
I want to get to something that
is just a cosine.

00:34:24.285 --> 00:34:27.799
I want to go down this path.
I am not going to cover this

00:34:27.799 --> 00:34:31.000
case, the critically damped
case.

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:34.972
And I will touch upon it later
but not dwell on it.

00:34:34.972 --> 00:34:39.183
Let me continue down the path
of the underdamped case,

00:34:39.183 --> 00:34:43.156
and this is what we have.
Continuing with the math,

00:34:43.156 --> 00:34:47.526
let's start with the initial
conditions, v nought equals

00:34:47.526 --> 00:34:50.704
zero, and that gives me K1 is
simply -VI.

00:34:50.704 --> 00:34:54.438
So at v(0)=0 t is zero,
so this terms goes away,

00:34:54.438 --> 00:34:58.013
the cosine becomes a 1,
e^(alpha t) goes away,

00:34:58.013 --> 00:35:04.090
and K1=-VI.
Then I know that i(0) and i is

00:35:04.090 --> 00:35:08.727
simply Cdv/dt.
And I get this nasty

00:35:08.727 --> 00:35:13.772
expression.
I substitute t=0 and I get

00:35:13.772 --> 00:35:20.454
something that looks like this.
I know what K1 is,

00:35:20.454 --> 00:35:27.818
and so therefore K2 is simply
-V1alpha divided by omega

00:35:27.818 --> 00:35:31.943
nought.
I have taken this expression

00:35:31.943 --> 00:35:34.997
where the unknowns K1 and K2 are
to be found.

00:35:34.997 --> 00:35:39.093
I set the initial conditions
down at t=0 and I get K1 and K2

00:35:39.093 --> 00:35:42.494
as follows, which gives me the
following solution.

00:35:42.494 --> 00:35:46.520
This is the solution I get
where I do not have any unknowns

00:35:46.520 --> 00:35:49.227
anymore.
Remember that omega d and alpha

00:35:49.227 --> 00:35:52.143
are directly related to circuit
parameters.

00:35:52.143 --> 00:35:56.169
Alpha was R/2L and omega d was
square root of alpha squared

00:35:56.169 --> 00:35:59.917
minus omega nought squared.
** omega d = sqrt(alpha^2 -

00:35:59.917 --> 00:36:04.456
omega_0^2) **
And omega nought squared was 1

00:36:04.456 --> 00:36:07.894
by square root of LC.
So I know it all now.

00:36:07.894 --> 00:36:12.888
I still have sines and cosines
here, so I am going to simplify

00:36:12.888 --> 00:36:17.146
this a little further.
Oh, before I go on to do that,

00:36:17.146 --> 00:36:21.730
let's do the Fineman trick
again and notice if I am still

00:36:21.730 --> 00:36:25.169
true to the LC circuit I did the
last time.

00:36:25.169 --> 00:36:30.000
Remember when R goes to zero
alpha goes to zero.

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:33.356
Because alpha is R divided by
2L.

00:36:33.356 --> 00:36:38.496
If alpha was zero what happens?
If alpha was zero,

00:36:38.496 --> 00:36:43.636
this guy goes to one,
this whole term goes to zero

00:36:43.636 --> 00:36:48.461
and omega dt now ends up
becoming omega nought,

00:36:48.461 --> 00:36:53.916
and I get this term here.
I get VI-VIcosine(omega t),

00:36:53.916 --> 00:37:00.000
which is exactly what I
expected in my equation.

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:07.515
This is the same as the LC case
that I got.

00:37:07.515 --> 00:37:17.000
Let's go back to this situation
and simply if further.

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:25.589
If you look at Appendix B.7 in
your course notes,

00:37:25.589 --> 00:37:34.000
Appendix B.7 is a quick
tutorial on trig.

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:37.063
And in that trig tutorial you
will see that,

00:37:37.063 --> 00:37:41.265
and you have probably seen this
before, too, multiple times,

00:37:41.265 --> 00:37:43.972
the scaled sum of sines are
also sines.

00:37:43.972 --> 00:37:47.106
This is an incredibly cool fact
of sinusoids.

00:37:47.106 --> 00:37:51.380
If you take two sinusoids of
the same frequency and you scale

00:37:51.380 --> 00:37:55.797
them up in any which way and add
them up you also end up with a

00:37:55.797 --> 00:37:58.646
sinusoid.
It is hard to believe but it is

00:37:58.646 --> 00:38:02.178
true.
It is an incredible property of

00:38:02.178 --> 00:38:04.497
sinusoids.
Take any two sinusoids,

00:38:04.497 --> 00:38:07.730
scale them in any way you like,
same frequency,

00:38:07.730 --> 00:38:10.261
add them up,
you will get a sinusoid.

00:38:10.261 --> 00:38:13.985
What that is saying is that,
look, here is a sinusoid,

00:38:13.985 --> 00:38:17.991
here is a sinusoidal function,
and I am scaling them up in

00:38:17.991 --> 00:38:21.014
some manner.
So I should be able to add them

00:38:21.014 --> 00:38:24.176
up and be able to express that
as single sine.

00:38:24.176 --> 00:38:27.269
And to be sure you can,
look at the Appendix,

00:38:27.269 --> 00:38:31.626
and there is an expression for
a1 sinX plus a2 cosX is equal to

00:38:31.626 --> 00:38:35.000
a cosine of blah,
blah, blah.

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:38.411
This is what you get.
No magic here.

00:38:38.411 --> 00:38:42.309
Just math.
From here I directly get this.

00:38:42.309 --> 00:38:47.572
And look at what I have.
It is absolutely unbelievable.

00:38:47.572 --> 00:38:51.762
v(t) is simply VI,
there is a constant here,

00:38:51.762 --> 00:38:58.000
this an e to the minus alpha
term and there is a cosine.

00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:02.126
Again, to pull the Fineman
trick, if this alpha were to go

00:39:02.126 --> 00:39:06.542
to zero here then you would end
up with the expression you had

00:39:06.542 --> 00:39:10.090
for the LC situation.
Let's stare at this a little

00:39:10.090 --> 00:39:12.914
while longer.
There is a constant plus a

00:39:12.914 --> 00:39:16.533
minus, a cosine term,
so there is a sinusoid at the

00:39:16.533 --> 00:39:21.167
output, and there is an e to the
minus alpha which ends up giving

00:39:21.167 --> 00:39:23.628
you the decay you have seen
before.

00:39:23.628 --> 00:39:25.873
In other words,
to a step input,

00:39:25.873 --> 00:39:30.000
the LC circuit would give you a
sinusoid.

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:34.426
That is what the LC circuit
would do if alpha was zero.

00:39:34.426 --> 00:39:39.262
But because of this alpha term
here, e to the minus alpha t,

00:39:39.262 --> 00:39:43.770
that gives rise to a damping
effect, so this causes this

00:39:43.770 --> 00:39:48.360
thing to become smaller and
smaller as time goes by until

00:39:48.360 --> 00:39:51.885
this term goes to zero at t
equals infinity.

00:39:51.885 --> 00:39:56.639
This guy damps down and so
therefore you end up getting the

00:39:56.639 --> 00:40:02.711
curve that you saw like this.
Twenty minutes of juggling math

00:40:02.711 --> 00:40:06.559
solving a second-order
differential equation,

00:40:06.559 --> 00:40:11.807
but what ends up is the same
sinusoid but it is damped in the

00:40:11.807 --> 00:40:17.142
following manner such that the
frequency, rather the amplitude

00:40:17.142 --> 00:40:22.215
keeps decaying until it starts
off at zero and then settles

00:40:22.215 --> 00:40:25.889
down at vI.
This is exactly what you saw in

00:40:25.889 --> 00:40:30.000
the demo that we showed you
earlier.

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:34.199
The critically damped case,
I am not going to do it here.

00:40:34.199 --> 00:40:37.800
I am going to point you to the
following insight.

00:40:37.800 --> 00:40:40.574
The underdamped case looked
like this.

00:40:40.574 --> 00:40:43.724
It was a sinusoid that kind of
decayed out.

00:40:43.724 --> 00:40:47.775
That is the underdamped case.
And then I showed you the

00:40:47.775 --> 00:40:51.300
overdamped case.
The overdamped case looked like

00:40:51.300 --> 00:40:53.550
this.
And, as you might expect,

00:40:53.550 --> 00:40:58.050
the critically damped case is
kind of in the middle and looks

00:40:58.050 --> 00:41:02.125
like this.
So the overdamped case would

00:41:02.125 --> 00:41:04.933
look like this,
underdamped like this,

00:41:04.933 --> 00:41:09.258
and the critically damped case
kind of goes up and kind of

00:41:09.258 --> 00:41:14.040
settles down almost immediately.
This is when alpha equals omega

00:41:14.040 --> 00:41:16.544
nought.
I won't do that case here,

00:41:16.544 --> 00:41:19.959
but I will simply point you to
Section 13.2.3.

00:41:19.959 --> 00:41:24.285
Just to tie things together,
recall this demo here that we

00:41:24.285 --> 00:41:28.611
showed you in class yesterday.
This is exactly the kind of

00:41:28.611 --> 00:41:34.000
form of the sinusoid you saw
because of that input step.

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:39.158
If you want to see a complete
analysis of inverter pairs and

00:41:39.158 --> 00:41:43.005
look at the delays and so on
because of that,

00:41:43.005 --> 00:41:46.502
you can look at Page 170 and
example 898.

00:41:46.502 --> 00:41:51.311
In the next five or six
minutes, what I would like to do

00:41:51.311 --> 00:41:56.469
is stare at the RLC circuit.
And much like I showed you some

00:41:56.469 --> 00:42:01.803
intuitive methods to get the RC
response, what we are going to

00:42:01.803 --> 00:42:06.000
do is do the same thing for the
RLC.

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:09.622
In the RLC situation,
much like the RC situation,

00:42:09.622 --> 00:42:13.773
experts don't go around writing
15 pages of differential

00:42:13.773 --> 00:42:18.301
equations and solving them each
time they see an RLC circuit.

00:42:18.301 --> 00:42:21.924
They stare at it and boom,
the response pops out,

00:42:21.924 --> 00:42:25.773
the sketch pops out.
This one is going to be another

00:42:25.773 --> 00:42:30.000
one like our Bend it Like
Beckham series here.

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:34.138
And this one is in honor of
Leslie Kolodziejski.

00:42:34.138 --> 00:42:38.012
And I call it "Konquer it like
Kolodziejski".

00:42:38.012 --> 00:42:42.238
Again, as I said,
experts don't go around solving

00:42:42.238 --> 00:42:47.345
long differential equations and
spending ten pages of notes

00:42:47.345 --> 00:42:51.836
trying to get a sinusoid.
They look at a circuit and

00:42:51.836 --> 00:42:55.798
sketch response.
I am going to show you how to

00:42:55.798 --> 00:42:59.691
do that, too.
And what you can do is,

00:42:59.691 --> 00:43:02.340
to practice,
go to Websim and try out

00:43:02.340 --> 00:43:06.459
various combinations of inputs
and initial conditions and

00:43:06.459 --> 00:43:10.432
sketch it, time yourself,
give yourself 30 seconds or a

00:43:10.432 --> 00:43:13.742
minute if you like,
and sketch it and check it

00:43:13.742 --> 00:43:18.009
against the Websim response.
If it doesn't match either you

00:43:18.009 --> 00:43:20.731
are wrong or there is a bug in
Websim.

00:43:20.731 --> 00:43:24.777
What I am going to do is,
the response to the critically

00:43:24.777 --> 00:43:30.000
damped and underdamped case was
very easy to sketch out.

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:33.470
You started with an initial
condition, you settled at VI and

00:43:33.470 --> 00:43:36.882
just kind of drew it like that.
The interesting case is the

00:43:36.882 --> 00:43:39.647
underdamped case,
and that is what I am going to

00:43:39.647 --> 00:43:41.941
dwell on.
Before we go on and I show you

00:43:41.941 --> 00:43:45.000
the intuitive method,
as a first step I would like to

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:47.882
build some intuition.
Let's stare at this response

00:43:47.882 --> 00:43:50.411
here and try to understand what
is going on.

00:43:50.411 --> 00:43:52.294
This is the response that we
saw.

00:43:52.294 --> 00:43:55.705
And this fact that you see an
oscillation happening is also

00:43:55.705 --> 00:43:58.352
called "ringing".
You say that your circuit is

00:43:58.352 --> 00:44:00.712
ringing.
All right.

00:44:00.712 --> 00:44:04.988
You see some interesting facts.
You see that frequency of the

00:44:04.988 --> 00:44:08.408
ringing is given by omega d.
This cosine omega d,

00:44:08.408 --> 00:44:10.688
so that is the frequency omega
d.

00:44:10.688 --> 00:44:13.396
So the time is 2 pi divided by
omega d.

00:44:13.396 --> 00:44:17.529
The oscillation frequency is
omega d, but omega d is simply

00:44:17.529 --> 00:44:20.380
omega nought squared minus alpha
squared.

00:44:20.380 --> 00:44:24.513
Once you have a big value of R
alpha becomes very small and

00:44:24.513 --> 00:44:30.000
omega d is very commonly equal
to, very close to omega nought.

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:34.471
So omega d and omega nought
very commonly are very close

00:44:34.471 --> 00:44:37.317
together.
And when that happens this

00:44:37.317 --> 00:44:40.081
frequency is directly omega
nought.

00:44:40.081 --> 00:44:43.821
Alpha governs how quickly your
sinusoid decays.

00:44:43.821 --> 00:44:48.130
e to the alpha t here is the
envelope that governs how

00:44:48.130 --> 00:44:52.682
quickly my sinusoid decays.
And notice that each of these

00:44:52.682 --> 00:44:56.910
terms, alpha and omega nought,
comes directly from my

00:44:56.910 --> 00:45:01.843
characteristic equation.
Which means that once you get

00:45:01.843 --> 00:45:05.656
your characteristic equation you
really don't have to do much

00:45:05.656 --> 00:45:07.944
else.
And up until now you still have

00:45:07.944 --> 00:45:10.741
to write the differential
equation to get the

00:45:10.741 --> 00:45:14.046
characteristic equation,
so you still have to do some

00:45:14.046 --> 00:45:17.733
differential equation stuff,
but in two lectures I am going

00:45:17.733 --> 00:45:20.847
to show you a way that you can
even write down the

00:45:20.847 --> 00:45:23.199
characteristic equation by
inspection.

00:45:23.199 --> 00:45:26.822
Look at your circuit and boom,
in 15 seconds or less write

00:45:26.822 --> 00:45:30.000
down the characteristic
equation.

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:34.188
It is absolutely unbelievable.
What are the other factors that

00:45:34.188 --> 00:45:37.553
are interesting here?
Of course I need to find out

00:45:37.553 --> 00:45:39.957
initial values.
I start off at zero.

00:45:39.957 --> 00:45:43.802
This is my capacitor voltage.
If I don't have an infinite

00:45:43.802 --> 00:45:48.060
spike or an impulse my capacitor
voltage tries to stay where it

00:45:48.060 --> 00:45:51.974
is and starts off at zero.
And the final value is given by

00:45:51.974 --> 00:45:56.094
VI, the capacitor is a long-term
open so therefore VI appears

00:45:56.094 --> 00:45:59.665
across the capacitor.
In the long-term my final value

00:45:59.665 --> 00:46:04.447
is going to be VI.
There is one other interesting

00:46:04.447 --> 00:46:09.422
parameter, which I will simply
define today but dwell on about

00:46:09.422 --> 00:46:12.930
a week from today,
and that is called the Q.

00:46:12.930 --> 00:46:17.335
Some of you may have heard the
term oh, that's a high Q

00:46:17.335 --> 00:46:20.516
circuit.
Q is an indication of how ringy

00:46:20.516 --> 00:46:23.779
the circuit is.
And Q is defined as omega

00:46:23.779 --> 00:46:27.287
nought by 2 alpha.
It is called the "quality

00:46:27.287 --> 00:46:30.638
factor".
And it turns out that Q is

00:46:30.638 --> 00:46:33.473
approximately the number of
cycles of ringing.

00:46:33.473 --> 00:46:37.128
So if you have a high Q you
ring for a long time and if you

00:46:37.128 --> 00:46:39.837
have a low Q you ring for a very
short time.

00:46:39.837 --> 00:46:43.365
That is called the quality
factor defined by omega nought

00:46:43.365 --> 00:46:44.941
by 2 alpha.
Notice that Q,

00:46:44.941 --> 00:46:46.705
omega nought,
alpha, omega d,

00:46:46.705 --> 00:46:50.044
all of these come from the
terms in the characteristic

00:46:50.044 --> 00:46:52.376
equation.
We will spend more time on Q

00:46:52.376 --> 00:46:54.707
later.
With this insight here is how I

00:46:54.707 --> 00:46:58.109
can go about very quickly
sketching out the form of the

00:46:58.109 --> 00:47:01.440
response.
Here is my circuit.

00:47:01.440 --> 00:47:05.987
I want to sketch the form of
the response for a step input at

00:47:05.987 --> 00:47:08.261
vI.
Zero to vI step input here,

00:47:08.261 --> 00:47:11.672
I want to find out what happens
at this point.

00:47:11.672 --> 00:47:16.220
This is described to you in a
lot more detail in Section 13.8

00:47:16.220 --> 00:47:19.858
in your course notes.
Let's go through the steps.

00:47:19.858 --> 00:47:23.041
Let's do the really simple
situation first.

00:47:23.041 --> 00:47:27.589
Let's also assume for fun that
you are given that v(0) starts

00:47:27.589 --> 00:47:33.066
out being some positive value.
Some v(0) which is a positive

00:47:33.066 --> 00:47:35.346
number.
And, to make it harder on

00:47:35.346 --> 00:47:39.835
ourselves, let's say i(0) starts
out being some negative number.

00:47:39.835 --> 00:47:42.115
So i(0) is some negative
current.

00:47:42.115 --> 00:47:46.319
The first thing I know is v(0),
the capacitor voltage starts

00:47:46.319 --> 00:47:48.813
out here, which can change
suddenly.

00:47:48.813 --> 00:47:52.518
And I also know that in the
long-term this is an open

00:47:52.518 --> 00:47:55.083
circuit.
So that this voltage vI will

00:47:55.083 --> 00:48:00.000
appear directly across the
capacitor in the long-term.

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:03.035
So I get starting out at v(0),
ending at vI,

00:48:03.035 --> 00:48:07.129
I am also half the way there.
I know the initial and ending

00:48:07.129 --> 00:48:10.588
point of the curve.
And then I know that somewhere

00:48:10.588 --> 00:48:13.905
in here there must be some funny
gyrations here,

00:48:13.905 --> 00:48:17.788
because remember I am dealing
with the underdamped case.

00:48:17.788 --> 00:48:21.599
And you can determine that from
alpha and omega nought.

00:48:21.599 --> 00:48:25.764
If alpha is less than omega
nought, you know that you are in

00:48:25.764 --> 00:48:30.000
the underdamped case and this is
what you get.

00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:33.766
Let's compute and write the
characteristic equation down.

00:48:33.766 --> 00:48:37.062
A week from today you will
write it by inspection,

00:48:37.062 --> 00:48:40.829
but for now you will do it by
writing down a differential

00:48:40.829 --> 00:48:43.251
equation.
And from the characteristic

00:48:43.251 --> 00:48:46.547
equation you will get omega d,
you will get alpha,

00:48:46.547 --> 00:48:49.439
omega nought and Q.
So omega d gives you the

00:48:49.439 --> 00:48:53.206
frequency of oscillations.
My frequency of oscillation is

00:48:53.206 --> 00:48:55.560
now known.
From Q I know how long it

00:48:55.560 --> 00:49:00.000
rings, because I know it rings
for about Q cycles.

00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:02.926
I know that ringing stops
approximately here.

00:49:02.926 --> 00:49:06.850
And then I know that between
that the start and end point my

00:49:06.850 --> 00:49:10.175
curve kind of looks like this,
something like this.

00:49:10.175 --> 00:49:12.769
Right there we are 95% of the
way there.

00:49:12.769 --> 00:49:16.760
The only question is I do not
know if it goes like this or it

00:49:16.760 --> 00:49:19.686
goes like this.
I am not quite sure yet if it

00:49:19.686 --> 00:49:22.679
starts off going high or starts
off going low.

00:49:22.679 --> 00:49:25.539
Not quite clear.
I also do not know what the

00:49:25.539 --> 00:49:30.170
maximum amplitude is.
It turns out this is rather

00:49:30.170 --> 00:49:34.269
complicated to determine so we
won't deal with that.

00:49:34.269 --> 00:49:37.645
Just simply so you can draw a
rough sketch.

00:49:37.645 --> 00:49:40.860
The questions is which way does
it start?

00:49:40.860 --> 00:49:43.995
I could leave it for you to
think about.

00:49:43.995 --> 00:49:47.853
Yeah, let me do that.
It is given on this page so

00:49:47.853 --> 00:49:50.425
don't look at it.
Think about it,

00:49:50.425 --> 00:49:55.087
and think about how you can
determine whether it goes up or

00:49:55.087 --> 00:49:57.900
down.
It turns out that in this case

00:49:57.900 --> 00:50:02.000
it is going to down and then
ring.

00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:06.654
See if you can figure it out
for yourselves and then we will

00:50:06.654 --> 00:50:08.254
talk about it next week.
