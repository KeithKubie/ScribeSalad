00:00:00.412 --> 00:00:01.870
In the last video,
we touched a bit

00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:05.720
on the idea of final
goods and services.

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:08.410
And we talked about
the situation in which

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:10.810
in the given period that
we're calculating GDP.

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:12.850
So this might be
in a given year.

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:14.790
If we're essentially
starting from scratch

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.450
and we put in the labor,
the land, we get the cotton.

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:19.594
The market value of that
is $10, that raw cotton.

00:00:19.594 --> 00:00:22.010
And then we're able to turn
that into thread with a market

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:23.680
value of $20 and we keep going.

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:26.360
And we keep on going and
going all the way until we

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:29.330
get the finished product of
jeans, which has a market

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:32.980
value of $50, we saw
in the last video

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:35.340
that the contribution
to GDP will just

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:36.890
be this final product.

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:39.270
It will just be the
$50 worth of jeans.

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.270
And we know its value
based on its market value,

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:43.160
what people are
willing to pay for it.

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:48.380
We would not count all of
these intermediary goods.

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:51.180
But that probably raised
the question in your head.

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.750
What if all of this does
not happen in a given year?

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.040
What if the period
ends, what if the year

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:00.727
were to end right over here?

00:01:00.727 --> 00:01:02.310
So we're thinking
about GDP in a year,

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:04.559
but we could think about GDP
in a quarter or whatever.

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.870
What if the period under
question ends over here?

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:08.580
So this is period one.

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:09.765
Let's call this period one.

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:16.010
And then this is going
to be period two.

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:17.960
So in period one,
we get to the point

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.660
that we have a market
value $20 worth of threat.

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:24.190
And then period two, we get
all the way to the jeans.

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:26.380
So this is period two over here.

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:27.550
So this might be one year.

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:29.520
And then this might be
the year after that.

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.660
What would happen
is in period one,

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:35.000
we would look at this good,
this intermediary good that's

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.550
sitting in someone's inventory
someplace that's getting ready

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:40.550
to be used to get
more finished, we

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:45.000
would say this is the
contribution to GDP.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.920
And it would be
considered an investment

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.711
because it's going to
be used in the future

00:01:48.711 --> 00:01:49.940
to produce other things.

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:54.990
So in period one, the
contribution will be $20.

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.910
And then in period
two, the contribution

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:01.470
won't be just the $50.

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:04.500
So we do get to a point that
the jeans are worth $50.

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.820
But so that we haven't
double counted the same $20

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.419
in both period one
and period two,

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:13.310
we'll subtract out what
our starting point was.

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.550
Or essentially,
we'll subtract out

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:17.910
the contribution, the
intermediary products that

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.320
were already counted
in previous periods.

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:23.050
Or you could say,
we'll subtract out

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:26.460
the market value of the
inputs at the beginning

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:28.110
of that period.

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:34.100
So you'd say, $50 minus the $20.

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.940
And so you would get
a contribution to GDP

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.810
by taking this $20
intermediary good

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.040
and turning it into
a $50 final good,

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:48.960
the contribution to GDP in
period two would be $30.
