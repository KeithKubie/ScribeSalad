00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:01.970
Hey,

2
00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:02.511
<v 1>what's going on?</v>

3
00:00:02.511 --> 00:00:05.870
It's Bill Burr and it's time for the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

4
00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:09.430
<v 2>March 19th.</v>

5
00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:11.870
<v 1>Dude, I'm in a great mood.</v>

6
00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:17.990
[inaudible] um, I'm to, I don't know why I just sang that song.

7
00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:20.570
I just been watching a bunch of fucking old, you know,

8
00:00:20.571 --> 00:00:23.750
I listened to old country now and then I started listening to old fucking rock

9
00:00:23.751 --> 00:00:27.470
and roll. You know what's his face just died.

10
00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:31.520
The guy used to fucking film chicks that he shit on or something,

11
00:00:31.521 --> 00:00:35.930
whatever his name is. Chuck Berry. Oh, well yeah.

12
00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:39.920
You know, it's part of one of his classics. Abuse in the background.

13
00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:41.000
You getting shitting on? People

14
00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.580
have such respect for him too. You know,

15
00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:51.680
it's just one stuff like that gets up once it gets out. Um,

16
00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.220
anyway, so I just been a, I'm in a great fucking mood because my fucking show,

17
00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.850
I had this a rotator cuff injury and it's just been fucking with me since,

18
00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:09.260
um, October and, uh, I finally found an exercise

19
00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.950
<v 2>works for me. For me. I just feel like for my shoulder,</v>

20
00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:16.890
my shoulder needs a safe place.

21
00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:24.270
[inaudible] lot of crying out

22
00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.250
<v 1>there. Um,</v>

23
00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.993
<v 0>okay.</v>

24
00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.240
<v 1>Alright. So this is, this is the exercise. If you,</v>

25
00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:35.810
if your rotator cuff is fucked up, like mine is, the problem is,

26
00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.850
is if you can look what this injury,

27
00:01:37.851 --> 00:01:40.220
it's like he can still pick up the same amount of weight.

28
00:01:40.221 --> 00:01:42.380
You can always pick up depending on the angle,

29
00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.520
but then shaking hands or just reaching for a salt shaker,

30
00:01:46.521 --> 00:01:49.550
all of a sudden you like ha this sharp pain.

31
00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:52.760
It's basically what I've learned is it's the muscle.

32
00:01:52.761 --> 00:01:57.680
Like it's when you first go to raise your arm, that first 30 degrees,

33
00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:59.390
that's what the fuck it is.

34
00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:01.940
And then the big boys take over whatever you're doing,

35
00:02:01.941 --> 00:02:05.030
how you lifting your lunch pail up. Maybe you got a giant fucking doughnut,

36
00:02:05.031 --> 00:02:09.770
you want to shove a d a face like I did today. I broke my rules about donuts.

37
00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:14.660
You know, my, uh, my wife, uh, was wanting some donuts,

38
00:02:14.661 --> 00:02:18.110
so I went by, there's a Dunkin donuts out here, right?

39
00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:21.590
So I show up and it's late in the day. It's like fucking two in the afternoon.

40
00:02:21.591 --> 00:02:25.670
So all the donuts are gone. You know, they're still making them,

41
00:02:25.671 --> 00:02:28.550
but they don't have, you know, they don't have that freshness to them.

42
00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:30.800
They got those, you know, the little Munchkins,

43
00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.630
they're like the worst flavors left.

44
00:02:32.631 --> 00:02:36.380
It was like blueberry custard and a fuck your mother,

45
00:02:36.381 --> 00:02:39.740
whatever the fuck it was called. And I was like, that's what you got left.

46
00:02:39.741 --> 00:02:41.120
They were like, yeah, let's take, I left.

47
00:02:41.121 --> 00:02:43.670
This is after the people in front of me could not make up their mind,

48
00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.973
<v 0>you know,</v>

49
00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:49.320
<v 1>can I get, we got a dozen donuts and they lay him down.</v>

50
00:02:49.321 --> 00:02:52.090
Now that's how long it's been since I've seen anybody get does it.

51
00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:53.280
Don't say lay them down.

52
00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.120
Back in the day they stood them up and the frosted from one donut gun on another

53
00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:58.950
donut, you know,

54
00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:02.320
and evidently gently with all the iPhones coming out for somebody finally

55
00:03:02.321 --> 00:03:06.130
decided, why don't we make the box a different shape and we'll lay him down.

56
00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:12.100
And I imagine the Steve Jobs of Dunkin donuts went to some sort of comic con of

57
00:03:12.101 --> 00:03:16.540
fat people and he came out in a turtleneck sweater with this fucking new balance

58
00:03:16.541 --> 00:03:20.800
sneakers and he fucking showed off the the box and everybody went, oh my God.

59
00:03:20.801 --> 00:03:24.250
Right there fucking man tits bouncing up and down.

60
00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.000
And do you think he gave credit to the poor,

61
00:03:28.001 --> 00:03:31.260
the poor little fucking eight year old in the background who had to put those

62
00:03:31.261 --> 00:03:33.330
things together? Huh?

63
00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:38.510
The blind nine year old girl who fucking designed the box down in fucking east

64
00:03:38.941 --> 00:03:41.280
Albuquerque. You think he gave him any credit cards? He didn't.

65
00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:46.140
Course he didn't. Oh, look who's here. My two angels.

66
00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:51.780
QT number one in QT number two. What's up buddy? Hey Nia,

67
00:03:51.781 --> 00:03:54.510
this is some bad language and if she can't understand it anyways,

68
00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:59.550
what's going on? You want to be on the podcast? Nini? Sure.

69
00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:00.890
We'll grab a mic though.

70
00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:04.790
[inaudible] you checked my nerve and you read them my brain.

71
00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:11.780
Um, yeah, you gotta grab stuff in the bag anyway. So what do we,

72
00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:15.570
what did I do? I know, I know.

73
00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:18.660
Come back. Come back in a minute. Come back in a minute.

74
00:04:18.661 --> 00:04:22.500
I'm in the middle of this story. Oh, all right. All right. Okay.

75
00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:25.380
Bye Cutie. Um,

76
00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:28.270
you know that fucking guy a little time to make the donuts.

77
00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:33.330
That was just an actor. So anyways, so I call up near okay. And I just go, yeah,

78
00:04:33.331 --> 00:04:36.340
they don't have any fucking donuts that their donuts suck there anyways.

79
00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:40.830
And she went, oh my God. She goes, blasphemy. A guy from Boston,

80
00:04:40.831 --> 00:04:45.330
which I'm not. I'm from the Boston area. I'm from the safe suburbs. Alright.

81
00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:49.080
So you can take your goodwill hunting fucking quotes and I, you can talk.

82
00:04:49.081 --> 00:04:51.810
Tell him to somebody else. Cause I grew up in a nice suburb. There was,

83
00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.450
it was called the Sachs. We played street hockey.

84
00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:58.410
We roasted marshmallows. All right.

85
00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:03.190
There was no, it's not your fault. There was none of that shit.

86
00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:07.150
Nobody liked apples and I sucked at math. Okay. That's it.

87
00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:12.760
I climbed trees and uh, and I had a paper route. Okay.

88
00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:14.200
So enough with the southeast shit.

89
00:05:14.201 --> 00:05:18.910
Anybody every from Massachusetts is not from South Boston. We didn't steal cars.

90
00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:23.830
Okay. A lot of us are from the suburbs. We slept in bunk beds.

91
00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:29.890
I'm so sick of that fucking movie.

92
00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:32.560
<v 3>Okay.</v>

93
00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:34.270
<v 1>Where are you from? You just, you just say, I,</v>

94
00:05:34.271 --> 00:05:38.290
you know from Massachusetts l bought Southie. Did you grow up in Southie?

95
00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:42.400
Did you like apples? Did you say?

96
00:05:42.401 --> 00:05:44.770
How about them apples down at the tasty,

97
00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:48.250
like some fucking stuck-up.

98
00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:52.410
Harvard con is going to mess with anybody ever from fucking swell backwards.

99
00:05:52.411 --> 00:05:55.890
South Boston used to be, now they're all Harvard grads that live down there.

100
00:05:55.891 --> 00:05:58.550
From what I've heard, I have no idea. I don't know what goes on in that city.

101
00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:01.150
Okay. Last time I lived there, they,

102
00:06:01.151 --> 00:06:04.520
they were just starting the big dig and that big ugly green thing was still

103
00:06:04.521 --> 00:06:07.790
there and going from Faneuil hall over to the North End,

104
00:06:07.791 --> 00:06:09.680
you took your life in your hands. You just felt it.

105
00:06:09.681 --> 00:06:14.570
You went underneath the fucking southeast expressway and it was scary,

106
00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:18.470
you know? Anyways, what the fuck am I? So I call her up. I just say, yeah,

107
00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:20.540
I got that done. It's suck. And she goes, oh my God. She goes,

108
00:06:20.541 --> 00:06:24.080
a Boston guy saying, Dunkin donuts sucks. That's blasting me. It's like, Nia,

109
00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:28.650
nobody gives a fuck about that donuts. It's all about the coffee. All right.

110
00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:30.680
I don't drink the coffee. I don't drink coffee.

111
00:06:30.681 --> 00:06:34.340
I don't like it tastes like dirty water. It Burns my tongue.

112
00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:39.380
It stains your teeth. It's just, it's a fucking, it's the Trifecta of, you know,

113
00:06:39.381 --> 00:06:42.050
I guess it helps you take a shit though. I know a lot of people like, you know,

114
00:06:42.051 --> 00:06:46.250
if you could coffee, smoke a CIG, take a good shit, get on with my day.

115
00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:49.700
You know, have a French fucking Corolla.

116
00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:55.000
It's all about the co like their bread and butters. The coffee. Okay.

117
00:06:55.001 --> 00:06:55.990
That's the lead singer.

118
00:06:55.991 --> 00:07:00.940
That's like if Dunkin donuts broke up and the coffee went solo.

119
00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:05.560
All right. That's the George Michael and the donuts, the, the,

120
00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:10.500
whatever the other guy's name was Andrew Ridgeley. Anyway,

121
00:07:10.501 --> 00:07:14.770
so I go, yeah, fuck that place. So, uh, oh. And the people in front of me,

122
00:07:14.771 --> 00:07:17.720
they couldn't make up their goddamn mind. Like, what do you want? Ah, why?

123
00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:22.260
What's in those? Oh,

124
00:07:22.261 --> 00:07:26.490
can we get two with, let's get three of those.

125
00:07:26.491 --> 00:07:30.600
They kept talking to each other is happening, we'll get three of the pink ones.

126
00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:34.860
Um, and I was already having a bad day cause, um,

127
00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:38.010
I keep my truck in storage now cause uh,

128
00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:40.860
we got the little one and it's just easier for my wife to get in and out of the

129
00:07:40.861 --> 00:07:43.610
garage. And I knew if I kept my truck there and show,

130
00:07:43.770 --> 00:07:47.010
always had to squeeze by it and try and get the fucking stroller and all that

131
00:07:47.011 --> 00:07:50.010
shit, you know, it's gonna happen eventually. She's going to be like,

132
00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:53.460
I don't know, what do we need three cars for?

133
00:07:53.610 --> 00:07:55.110
And eventually she's going to make me sell it.

134
00:07:55.110 --> 00:07:59.310
So I did a preemptive strike and I immediately put it in fucking storage before

135
00:07:59.311 --> 00:08:03.840
she could bitch about it. So I had it over the last fucking like five days.

136
00:08:03.870 --> 00:08:06.180
Love. And so I just switch out. All right.

137
00:08:06.570 --> 00:08:10.320
I put Jackie in storage and I take out the old girl. Right.

138
00:08:10.321 --> 00:08:12.000
And I drove her for like five fucking days.

139
00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:15.030
And of course the battery died cause I forgot to unhook the, uh,

140
00:08:15.031 --> 00:08:18.660
the terminals there had to get it jumped out at the comedy store.

141
00:08:20.430 --> 00:08:23.980
Um, and uh, anyway,

142
00:08:23.981 --> 00:08:28.260
so I'm going to return the car today and it's the day before I go on the road.

143
00:08:28.261 --> 00:08:31.860
So we have a rule in my house, in my house, there is a roll.

144
00:08:34.110 --> 00:08:37.890
Um, the basically the day before I go on the road, I bet it's family day.

145
00:08:37.891 --> 00:08:39.720
I hang out, you know, I make breakfast,

146
00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:42.930
I made some fucking meatballs that cook the Goddamn chicken.

147
00:08:42.930 --> 00:08:46.120
I make sure that she's got food in the fridge, you know, I'm a,

148
00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:51.260
so I make sure she's going to be all right. Right. So I go, all right,

149
00:08:51.261 --> 00:08:54.690
I gotta return my truck. She's like, who you p pack? I'm like,

150
00:08:54.691 --> 00:08:57.060
I'm going to be back. So, alright.

151
00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:00.630
So I get in a truck and I do what I always do. I drive down the phone,

152
00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:03.570
I gotta move fucking, you know, I gotta move her car. I become like a valet,

153
00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:05.280
cause I had the shittiest driveway ever it. Right.

154
00:09:05.850 --> 00:09:10.380
So I'm fucking driving up the street and as always, big stupid grin on my face.

155
00:09:10.410 --> 00:09:14.310
It's my favorite thing ever. It's three on the tree. It's so much fun to drive.

156
00:09:15.090 --> 00:09:17.970
And whenever I get a little bit of space out here and I just get the fucking run

157
00:09:17.971 --> 00:09:21.240
through all three gears, that's all I want to do. Every time I do,

158
00:09:21.450 --> 00:09:23.730
I get why I want a second. I get it into third gear.

159
00:09:23.731 --> 00:09:26.910
I always have the window down. Even though I put some ac in there,

160
00:09:26.911 --> 00:09:28.860
I never fucking you. I didn't use it for so long.

161
00:09:28.861 --> 00:09:31.590
I turned it on and all this white shit came out and I breathed it in and

162
00:09:31.591 --> 00:09:35.550
probably took like fucking nine years off my life. Um,

163
00:09:36.390 --> 00:09:39.050
anytime I get it up into third gear and I'm cruising down the street,

164
00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:40.280
I always do the same thing. I always go,

165
00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:42.060
<v 4>whoa,</v>

166
00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:42.893
<v 1>every time.</v>

167
00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:48.930
I never did that once in nine years old and my Prius ever. It's just,

168
00:09:48.931 --> 00:09:53.460
it's the greatest sound in the fucking world.

169
00:09:54.810 --> 00:09:57.810
It's the sign of a big fucking American engine.

170
00:09:58.330 --> 00:10:03.090
Make it run through the fucking gears. Loud pipes.

171
00:10:03.091 --> 00:10:04.860
It's the greatest fucking sound ever.

172
00:10:04.861 --> 00:10:07.650
And every time I get through when I go up the street, right?

173
00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:11.730
So I'm having a great time. You know, I'm driving down the street,

174
00:10:12.690 --> 00:10:14.250
I got the am radio one,

175
00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:18.060
I usually listen to Keyshawn Johnson's fucking sports show, but you know,

176
00:10:18.061 --> 00:10:22.400
it's the weekend. So it wasn't on. And any ways I get on to, um,

177
00:10:24.270 --> 00:10:24.551
you know,

178
00:10:24.551 --> 00:10:29.100
I get onto the fucking highway and of course I'm cruising along and right before

179
00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:33.870
we get to, I get to my exit. It's just like this traffic from fucking,

180
00:10:34.740 --> 00:10:37.260
it's like five in the afternoon traffic of a fucking truck.

181
00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:41.040
Jackknifed and it's just, of course my exit.

182
00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:45.360
And I told the people I'd be over there by noon, so I'm starting to feel stress.

183
00:10:45.450 --> 00:10:48.000
I'm like, what the fuck is going on? So I tried to make a fucking, you know,

184
00:10:48.001 --> 00:10:52.200
a bust and move here. Right. Even on from the suburbs, a Massachusetts move,

185
00:10:52.201 --> 00:10:53.730
I'm going to go around all this shit,

186
00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:57.180
act like I'm going to drive by and then I'm going to fucking cut in and I don't

187
00:10:57.181 --> 00:11:00.930
know what the fuck was going on. I couldn't see any, any accidents.

188
00:11:00.931 --> 00:11:04.560
So I'm trying to go from one highway to another, so like, I know what I'll do,

189
00:11:04.561 --> 00:11:07.590
I'll just fucking, rather than go east, like I want to,

190
00:11:07.591 --> 00:11:11.850
I'll just get on the west side, I'll take the highway west, go down one exit,

191
00:11:12.030 --> 00:11:14.450
and then I'll curl back around because I can see in the overpass,

192
00:11:14.850 --> 00:11:19.110
there's no fucking traffic. I don't know where the food was.

193
00:11:19.111 --> 00:11:23.190
Like this offshoot to the on ramp, right? That everyone was going down. Like,

194
00:11:23.191 --> 00:11:23.701
I don't know what the,

195
00:11:23.701 --> 00:11:27.270
like Paul Simon was doing like a free concert of some shit that was the level

196
00:11:27.271 --> 00:11:31.860
of, of, of uh, traffic. So I say,

197
00:11:31.861 --> 00:11:35.490
fuck it. I get out of the traffic, I drive down and get it up to third gay,

198
00:11:36.470 --> 00:11:37.303
<v 4>right.</v>

199
00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:41.050
<v 1>I'd fucking go to go west to turn one fucking block, you know,</v>

200
00:11:41.150 --> 00:11:44.410
one exit up and then come back around. And as I fucking go there,

201
00:11:44.411 --> 00:11:48.370
all of a sudden this is all this other traffic going the other direction. And I,

202
00:11:48.610 --> 00:11:49.280
and, and this,

203
00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:52.990
the first time since I started meditating that I had an absolute meltdown.

204
00:11:53.830 --> 00:11:58.360
I literally screamed as loud as I possibly could. Fuck you, la,

205
00:12:00.310 --> 00:12:04.510
every fucking cock sucking mother fucking con fucking every word you could

206
00:12:04.511 --> 00:12:09.450
possibly think, you know, and then I'm fucking just stuck.

207
00:12:09.451 --> 00:12:13.500
And even worst traffic going the other way to go, one fucking exit, you know,

208
00:12:13.710 --> 00:12:15.450
up to come back around.

209
00:12:15.810 --> 00:12:19.890
And all I'm thinking is where the fuck I would be if I just just took the pain

210
00:12:19.891 --> 00:12:22.500
to begin with and just stayed in that traffic jam.

211
00:12:22.501 --> 00:12:24.840
I'd be creeping forward and whatever.

212
00:12:25.970 --> 00:12:29.510
Why didn't I just call the place and say I was going to be a little late? Oh,

213
00:12:29.511 --> 00:12:31.730
you know what bill, cause that would have been the chill thing to do, right?

214
00:12:31.731 --> 00:12:36.250
I didn't. So it turns out I look up, I'm like, what the,

215
00:12:36.330 --> 00:12:38.720
this is like, it's Saturday at noon.

216
00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:43.430
How was he at five o'clock in the afternoon on Friday traffic.

217
00:12:43.431 --> 00:12:45.080
I am like literally beside myself,

218
00:12:47.090 --> 00:12:49.820
just saying every curse I possibly can.

219
00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:53.840
And I look up and there's two little flashers going on and it's tow truck

220
00:12:53.841 --> 00:12:56.930
flashers, right? And I'm like, Oh, here we go. Hey,

221
00:12:56.931 --> 00:13:01.130
this is all rubber necking and on the other side of the road it's fucking going,

222
00:13:01.131 --> 00:13:04.820
you know, like gang busters. Everybody's cruising by. That's where I want to be,

223
00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:11.570
right? And I can't get to it. So I'm like,

224
00:13:11.571 --> 00:13:15.240
you fucking fucking rabbinic in pieces.

225
00:13:15.470 --> 00:13:16.730
What something we changing a tire,

226
00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:19.430
it's going to be a fender bender and I'm losing my shit out there.

227
00:13:19.431 --> 00:13:20.960
If I was a fucking dictator,

228
00:13:21.140 --> 00:13:24.410
I would deliberately have a car on the side of the road changing a tire who'll

229
00:13:24.411 --> 00:13:26.570
never slowed down and looked at it would be eliminated,

230
00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:31.430
would be removed from society, Fred to the fucking pigs,

231
00:13:31.431 --> 00:13:32.264
whatever the hell it is.

232
00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:35.780
Whenever that fest fucking North Korea does to his God damn relatives feeds them

233
00:13:35.900 --> 00:13:39.020
to dogs. That's what I would do. I was actually, I was so fucking mad.

234
00:13:39.140 --> 00:13:41.180
I was like, you know that Fed fucking North Korea.

235
00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:44.180
He's actually making sense to me. You know?

236
00:13:44.870 --> 00:13:48.470
So I get all the way up. I should be careful, man. It makes sense.

237
00:13:48.471 --> 00:13:52.130
Somebody over here a missed me. I'm like, he did do his other, you know,

238
00:13:52.220 --> 00:13:53.720
we set up those two fucking whores over there,

239
00:13:53.721 --> 00:13:57.320
right to take out his fucking stepbrother. Um, so anyways,

240
00:13:57.350 --> 00:13:59.900
I get all the way up to uh, the traffic jam.

241
00:13:59.901 --> 00:14:02.420
Of course it's a little fender bender, there's people standing there,

242
00:14:02.660 --> 00:14:06.110
there's nothing going on, but I'm finally going to get past it.

243
00:14:06.590 --> 00:14:08.120
Finally going to get off the exit,

244
00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:11.780
come around and fucking runs through the gears and fucking go down the other

245
00:14:11.781 --> 00:14:12.021
side.

246
00:14:12.021 --> 00:14:15.530
And what do I see on the other side of the road where it was all nice and clear.

247
00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:20.270
Now there's major traffic can because the dumb con's on the other side of the

248
00:14:20.271 --> 00:14:23.360
highway, I slowing down to look at the shit on my side of the highway.

249
00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:27.560
So now I've got to sit to it fucking twice. And something told me,

250
00:14:27.590 --> 00:14:31.400
don't get off at the first exit bill. Everybody has this idea.

251
00:14:31.550 --> 00:14:35.090
Go to the second exit and you know, and then come back and guess what I did?

252
00:14:35.091 --> 00:14:39.170
I ignored that instinct. Got Off the first one, bom, Bom, Bom,

253
00:14:39.171 --> 00:14:42.140
Bom de fucking dead stop traffic.

254
00:14:43.460 --> 00:14:45.170
And the only way to get back on the highways,

255
00:14:45.171 --> 00:14:47.600
I gotta make this illegal u-turn and I don't give a fuck.

256
00:14:47.601 --> 00:14:51.320
I'm making it and I'm just sitting there cock sucking mother fucking dictate and

257
00:14:51.321 --> 00:14:55.040
fucking cut all their fucking heads off and I'm getting ready to make my illegal

258
00:14:55.580 --> 00:14:57.110
uturn and I just happened to look in my,

259
00:14:57.350 --> 00:15:01.520
your rear view mirror and guess what's two cars behind me? A fucking cop.

260
00:15:03.510 --> 00:15:04.343
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

261
00:15:04.970 --> 00:15:09.140
<v 1>I'm like, what are the fucking odds now I gotta go straight. I said fuck this.</v>

262
00:15:09.141 --> 00:15:13.850
So I get in the right lane and I just cruise up and I get out of his sight and I

263
00:15:13.851 --> 00:15:16.880
finally fucking turn around. I got no,

264
00:15:16.881 --> 00:15:19.850
I finally got into a good lane and I came back and then I got back on under

265
00:15:19.851 --> 00:15:23.390
traffic again, looked at the same people looking at the same accident.

266
00:15:23.391 --> 00:15:27.110
There was nothing going on. And then I fucking finally was able to continue on.

267
00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:31.910
And of course they made the call. There was no problem. Nobody gave a shit.

268
00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:36.040
Nobody yelled at me. It was fine. I completely lost my shit and I'm NBA.

269
00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:41.230
I got so fucking mad that when I saw the people on the other side of the road

270
00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:47.760
rubbernecking I gave them the finger and that was all the way to the right

271
00:15:47.961 --> 00:15:51.290
getting off the highway and I gave all of the family it like,

272
00:15:52.070 --> 00:15:53.840
do you realize how immature that is?

273
00:15:56.150 --> 00:15:57.140
I mean I was just like,

274
00:15:57.440 --> 00:16:02.120
have you ever been embarrassed about yourself by yourself?

275
00:16:02.270 --> 00:16:05.750
Like I actually hit that level cause like I stuck my whole fucking arm out the

276
00:16:05.751 --> 00:16:08.600
window giving them the finger. The person behind me could see it be like,

277
00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:10.270
who's this guy giving him the fingertip?

278
00:16:11.010 --> 00:16:11.843
<v 3>Okay.</v>

279
00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:16.080
<v 1>You know, I basically said it wasn't one of my best moments. But anyways,</v>

280
00:16:16.380 --> 00:16:17.580
as I mentioned earlier,

281
00:16:19.890 --> 00:16:20.350
<v 3>um,</v>

282
00:16:20.350 --> 00:16:21.950
<v 1>I am, one of the great things is I,</v>

283
00:16:21.990 --> 00:16:26.990
somebody showed me this exercise for a rehabbing the rotator cuff and it's

284
00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:33.870
fucking been great. First of all,

285
00:16:34.590 --> 00:16:39.180
what you do is you basically either be or bend over at the waist. No,

286
00:16:39.210 --> 00:16:41.370
you're not going to take it up the ass. Okay.

287
00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:43.140
Before anybody makes that easy joke.

288
00:16:43.620 --> 00:16:46.920
You let your arm hang down and then what you start doing is basically your

289
00:16:46.921 --> 00:16:50.670
finger, your whole, your fingers are pointed at the floor,

290
00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:54.600
your arms hang and straight down and you just make small circles, right?

291
00:16:55.050 --> 00:16:56.850
And counterclockwise or clockwise.

292
00:16:57.150 --> 00:17:00.600
And then you just start to make it bigger and bigger chest to just get to the

293
00:17:00.601 --> 00:17:03.210
point of pain. And then you live there for a minute,

294
00:17:03.211 --> 00:17:06.840
then you back it back down to small circles and then go clockwise.

295
00:17:06.870 --> 00:17:08.850
If you want counterclockwise, you just go vice versa.

296
00:17:08.851 --> 00:17:10.890
You just go the other direction. You do the same thing again.

297
00:17:11.310 --> 00:17:13.860
Whatever that does, it kind of gets some fucking, I don't Lube in there.

298
00:17:13.861 --> 00:17:17.310
I have no idea. I don't know shit about anatomy. Right? Um,

299
00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:19.080
and anyways,

300
00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:24.080
and then what you do is you have your arm straight out,

301
00:17:25.860 --> 00:17:28.740
not straight out. You have it down in an angle. You walk up to a wall.

302
00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:32.250
All right, I have to explain this part perfectly. All right. And by the way,

303
00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:33.630
you're at your own risk on this one.

304
00:17:35.250 --> 00:17:36.083
<v 3>Um,</v>

305
00:17:36.820 --> 00:17:39.880
<v 1>you have your arm probably at like a whatever, 15 degree angle.</v>

306
00:17:39.881 --> 00:17:44.380
You're standing right next to the wall, um, sideways. Okay.

307
00:17:45.410 --> 00:17:48.550
Is that perpendicular to the wall? I have no fucking idea. Right? It's like,

308
00:17:48.580 --> 00:17:51.780
just imagine wall was your friend and the two of you went to a,

309
00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:54.630
a general admission concert and you got there early.

310
00:17:54.660 --> 00:17:56.670
Just imagine what the space would be between the two of you,

311
00:17:56.671 --> 00:18:00.630
but you'd be both looking at the same shit, right? It still doesn't make sense.

312
00:18:01.300 --> 00:18:05.220
Perpendicularly the fucking thing. All right, so you reach out,

313
00:18:05.320 --> 00:18:06.900
you touch the wall, all right,

314
00:18:06.930 --> 00:18:10.950
your arms at a 15 degree angle and then you just slowly start walking it up.

315
00:18:10.951 --> 00:18:12.690
And obviously as it gets more straight,

316
00:18:12.691 --> 00:18:16.680
you're going to have to move your body further away from the wall and you just

317
00:18:16.681 --> 00:18:20.820
walk it up with your fingers. So it's basically,

318
00:18:20.821 --> 00:18:23.310
it's the weight of your arm, but your fingers are taken away,

319
00:18:23.311 --> 00:18:28.311
most of the weight and walk it all the fucking way up until it's like you know

320
00:18:28.951 --> 00:18:32.850
the answer in a classroom and you're so excited and your straight up and then

321
00:18:32.851 --> 00:18:35.400
you walk it back down. You do a set of three to five

322
00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:40.640
and I did it. I've been doing it twice a day and my fucking shoulders. Amazing.

323
00:18:40.641 --> 00:18:45.590
And then I sit afterwards. Um, and it feels fucking amazing.

324
00:18:45.591 --> 00:18:48.830
I actually sat down and played a little drums today. It was fucking phenomenal.

325
00:18:48.890 --> 00:18:50.540
And uh, I don't know,

326
00:18:50.541 --> 00:18:52.970
maybe that maybe somebody could explain it a little bit better.

327
00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:57.530
Maybe there's a youtube video of it. I don't know. Um,

328
00:18:57.650 --> 00:19:01.730
so anyways, that's what I've been doing and I feel great. And um,

329
00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:02.770
<v 3>okay.</v>

330
00:19:02.770 --> 00:19:04.210
<v 1>The Guy who, uh,</v>

331
00:19:05.340 --> 00:19:05.790
<v 3>okay</v>

332
00:19:05.790 --> 00:19:10.680
<v 1>is basically keeping my dog for the rest of her life, so I know she'll be safe,</v>

333
00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:10.980
uh,

334
00:19:10.980 --> 00:19:15.480
was in town and he brought her by and I got to take her on a couple of hikes we

335
00:19:15.481 --> 00:19:20.100
hung out and um, you know, it's sort of like a shared custody thing.

336
00:19:20.101 --> 00:19:24.150
I mean he has a like 95% of the time, but I know she saved,

337
00:19:24.151 --> 00:19:29.080
she looked great and um, it's awesome. I Dunno,

338
00:19:29.090 --> 00:19:30.920
I dunno if it's good or bad for me to keep seeing her,

339
00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:34.550
cause it's always fucking unbelievably sad every time when I give her back.

340
00:19:34.551 --> 00:19:36.860
But as long as I know the next time I'm going to see her,

341
00:19:36.861 --> 00:19:38.090
then I kind of have hope or whatever.

342
00:19:38.210 --> 00:19:41.960
I just keep jokingly say that she went to college and this is like spring break,

343
00:19:41.961 --> 00:19:45.380
you know, she comes back in March or whatever. But, um,

344
00:19:46.910 --> 00:19:50.360
but it's, it, you know, what's great is I know she's okay.

345
00:19:50.450 --> 00:19:54.140
I know she's gonna live out a full life. And you know,

346
00:19:54.141 --> 00:19:57.950
whenever that day comes, when she's coming down to the end of it,

347
00:19:57.951 --> 00:20:00.970
I'm gonna be there. Cause I always, I kind of made a promise, you know,

348
00:20:01.180 --> 00:20:03.740
you know, when you get a dog that's like, you know, that's it.

349
00:20:03.770 --> 00:20:08.390
Like how much you love a dog. It's like, dude, I'm there until the end. And, um,

350
00:20:08.750 --> 00:20:12.680
you know, even though the way it worked out with having a kid and everything,

351
00:20:13.250 --> 00:20:14.270
um, the,

352
00:20:14.340 --> 00:20:18.770
the main point of the whole thing was that she survived and she had a great

353
00:20:18.771 --> 00:20:19.670
life. She's got this, you know,

354
00:20:19.700 --> 00:20:24.100
she's living in a great house now in Arizona and all that type of shit. And, um,

355
00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:26.630
it just means I'll play Arizona more.

356
00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:32.090
And the person who owns it makes frequent treat trips out here,

357
00:20:32.330 --> 00:20:34.570
always drives out. And I think, uh,

358
00:20:34.700 --> 00:20:37.270
he'll always bring it cause he knows that we love our Nia.

359
00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:39.350
Got to see her and everything. She came back over,

360
00:20:39.351 --> 00:20:43.820
the house was hanging out and um, you know,

361
00:20:43.821 --> 00:20:48.540
she met smelt like a, so she was cool, but uh, it really was never a,

362
00:20:48.610 --> 00:20:52.210
Oh my God, I just said a fucking name. I just added her name. Um,

363
00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:55.150
anyways. And uh,

364
00:20:57.220 --> 00:21:01.570
she just basically, you know, it was never about the kid.

365
00:21:01.571 --> 00:21:03.940
It was about everybody else that was going to become and by,

366
00:21:03.941 --> 00:21:07.540
and it was going to be too crazy and the dog was going to get even more

367
00:21:07.541 --> 00:21:11.680
protective. And you know, I went through with the whole trainer.

368
00:21:11.860 --> 00:21:14.380
It was like the dog's going to go to a whole nother level and I just knew

369
00:21:14.381 --> 00:21:17.410
something, something was going to happen with the craziness they having a kid.

370
00:21:17.410 --> 00:21:22.150
So we just, we made the right decision. Um, anyways.

371
00:21:23.170 --> 00:21:25.000
Uh, all right. Where do we go from here? Um,

372
00:21:25.030 --> 00:21:28.240
I'm going to edit that out by the way. That's gonna know you guys.

373
00:21:28.241 --> 00:21:31.750
You said the name you should live is fucking know so many Weirdos out there.

374
00:21:32.110 --> 00:21:36.010
So many Weirdos. So anyways, what have I been up to?

375
00:21:36.011 --> 00:21:40.780
I've been watching a little bit of them match madness as much as I can,

376
00:21:40.810 --> 00:21:45.510
you know, having the Kiddo around, um, I watched Duke,

377
00:21:46.540 --> 00:21:48.610
you know, when their first round, I don't know,

378
00:21:48.611 --> 00:21:51.040
I'm assuming they won the second round or I would have,

379
00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:55.990
I'm assuming that they're in the fucking sweet 16. My Internet sucks right now.

380
00:21:56.150 --> 00:21:59.410
Your Internet is such a fucking, I, I went, I spent all this fucking money.

381
00:21:59.470 --> 00:22:03.700
I was just like, dude, you get me fucking the Internet that Jesus would have.

382
00:22:03.730 --> 00:22:06.640
And they said, all right, it's going to be 9 million bucks. I said,

383
00:22:06.641 --> 00:22:10.720
I'll write that fucking check you, you fucking criminal. And they said, fine.

384
00:22:10.900 --> 00:22:15.690
And I had the best Internet for about six months and then slowly it just start

385
00:22:15.691 --> 00:22:16.570
sucking again.

386
00:22:17.050 --> 00:22:20.380
And what it is is I think they just turn the juice up on your house,

387
00:22:21.340 --> 00:22:22.810
whoever's paying the most for it.

388
00:22:23.290 --> 00:22:26.740
And then the next guy gets bumped back and then he's like, hey,

389
00:22:26.741 --> 00:22:30.040
what the fuck happened? Am I good internet? Well, you know, we upgraded but,

390
00:22:30.041 --> 00:22:32.230
but then he plays, whoever pays more than me.

391
00:22:32.650 --> 00:22:34.870
See I haven't gone back to them in like two years.

392
00:22:34.871 --> 00:22:36.070
And now like I can't even get,

393
00:22:36.370 --> 00:22:39.850
I get internet and like two rooms at my house and the rest of it sucks.

394
00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:43.690
Let's see if I can look this up. March madness.

395
00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:45.633
<v 3>Okay.</v>

396
00:22:47.370 --> 00:22:51.820
<v 1>Uh, there we go. Here we go. Here we go. CBS Sports. What's going on? Come on.</v>

397
00:22:52.630 --> 00:22:56.350
This is like, you root for the slowest horse ever. Now come on load.

398
00:22:57.960 --> 00:23:01.890
Oh my God. It worked and it worked. March madness,

399
00:23:01.891 --> 00:23:06.750
2017 live tournament scores. Update. Baba Baba Baba was the fucking bracket.

400
00:23:07.860 --> 00:23:12.420
Kansas is the team we expected. I love Kansas. I love cab. Always.

401
00:23:12.421 --> 00:23:15.920
I don't know why. I've always loved Kansas. I like Duke. UCLA.

402
00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:20.460
It's fucking fun to see them just because there's such a legendary franchise.

403
00:23:21.790 --> 00:23:22.623
Um,

404
00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:28.350
Syracuse exchange plan plans to extend Boeheim I don't see,

405
00:23:28.351 --> 00:23:31.950
I mean how to watch Duke Versus Carolina. What

406
00:23:33.730 --> 00:23:37.920
a the number two blue devils will take on numbers all on the number seven.

407
00:23:38.250 --> 00:23:40.020
Uh Oh, South Carolina, North Carolina.

408
00:23:41.330 --> 00:23:43.470
I when the fuck are they doing that and I gotta wash it all.

409
00:23:43.471 --> 00:23:47.810
All the Duke Games get get taped next year I think I'm going to add to my sports

410
00:23:47.811 --> 00:23:52.100
package and I want to watch as many of the Duke Games and Kansas.

411
00:23:52.101 --> 00:23:52.934
I don't know why.

412
00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:57.770
I've always loved Kansas and Duke, I got into,

413
00:23:57.920 --> 00:24:00.770
cause I got a couple of friends that went there and then I went to a game and

414
00:24:00.771 --> 00:24:03.500
they treated us great. So like we would die. It's over.

415
00:24:03.740 --> 00:24:07.220
I got to call and coach k show. It's all, wait a second.

416
00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:12.770
Did they lose end of the second half?

417
00:24:17.110 --> 00:24:21.560
Why the fucking gay cops beat him? No.

418
00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:23.030
<v 3>Okay.</v>

419
00:24:23.030 --> 00:24:27.820
<v 1>88 81 get the fuck outta here. No fucking way.</v>

420
00:24:30.110 --> 00:24:32.660
No fucking way. Duke Score.

421
00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:39.200
I just spelled scores Duke score.

422
00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:44.440
No fucking way. They fucking lost. Ah,

423
00:24:46.910 --> 00:24:47.750
Jesus Christ.

424
00:24:49.710 --> 00:24:53.220
South Carolina scored 65 fucking points in the second half.

425
00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:57.990
They scored 23 in the first half. Duke scored 30 and 51.

426
00:24:59.220 --> 00:25:02.190
Oh Man. I mean, I knew, I knew that they didn't have the team this year,

427
00:25:02.191 --> 00:25:06.110
but shit, I thought they at least get to the sweet 16. Um,

428
00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:11.420
well I hope that Jason Tatum guy doesn't be fucking one and done.

429
00:25:11.421 --> 00:25:15.610
I hope he comes back. Um, and I liked that loop.

430
00:25:15.620 --> 00:25:20.170
Cannard kid, you know Grayson Alley? Yeah. I'm just coming off the bench really.

431
00:25:20.171 --> 00:25:22.450
Well, you'd think, you know, with all that shit I wanted to be hated.

432
00:25:22.451 --> 00:25:25.570
You'd think he'd be a, you'd think he pouted he think he would pout,

433
00:25:25.571 --> 00:25:28.870
but he didn't. He, uh, he was a fucking man about it. All right, well,

434
00:25:28.871 --> 00:25:33.010
congratulations to South Carolina. Jesus Christ.

435
00:25:33.011 --> 00:25:36.100
I know a lot of educators out there loved listening to that in real time.

436
00:25:36.370 --> 00:25:39.940
Me discovering that they fucking lost. Um,

437
00:25:42.700 --> 00:25:47.620
God damn it. All right. Um, the Kansas sets my team, Kansas Jayhawks.

438
00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:51.370
Um, I respect all of them, man. I, I really don't like, you know,

439
00:25:51.430 --> 00:25:53.560
I come from a pro sports town, so, uh,

440
00:25:53.890 --> 00:25:57.190
I don't really have any sort of hatred for anybody. You know what I mean?

441
00:25:57.191 --> 00:26:00.100
I don't even hate the fucking North Carolina. I don't even,

442
00:26:00.101 --> 00:26:03.010
I don't even fucking hate him. I don't hate NC state. I just like,

443
00:26:03.070 --> 00:26:07.660
I love how the tradition of all it, you know, I could sit back, I might just,

444
00:26:07.690 --> 00:26:11.530
I picked the fucking team so I can actually get involved in it, I guess.

445
00:26:12.820 --> 00:26:15.130
Um, so anyways, I'll root for Kansas the rest of the way out.

446
00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:18.830
And I also like seeing UCLA do well. Well, um,

447
00:26:19.910 --> 00:26:23.360
and of course any, any fucking underdog. I was, I was watching Northwestern.

448
00:26:23.420 --> 00:26:27.110
It sucked. Watching them loose. Did they? They lost, uh, they came back.

449
00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:30.830
They were against the, uh, Gonzaga who I'm so old to me,

450
00:26:31.010 --> 00:26:33.590
they're still the new kids in town even though they've been crushing it for

451
00:26:33.591 --> 00:26:35.810
almost fucking two decades at this point. Anyways,

452
00:26:35.811 --> 00:26:36.830
let's get back to the podcast.

453
00:26:36.831 --> 00:26:39.020
Let's get back to maybe something build that you sort of know about.

454
00:26:40.040 --> 00:26:41.510
How about that? So anyways,

455
00:26:41.511 --> 00:26:45.400
I was listening to all this fucking old rock and roll shit, you know, and uh,

456
00:26:45.420 --> 00:26:46.710
of course if you listed all that shit, you,

457
00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:50.800
you're eventually gonna run into buddy Holly. And, uh,

458
00:26:50.801 --> 00:26:54.520
I was in that pig pay pit. The pit debate.

459
00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:00.050
Um,

460
00:27:00.050 --> 00:27:03.030
and I always loved the drums on that and I never knew what the fuck the guy was

461
00:27:03.031 --> 00:27:07.740
doing. I guess he was just playing paradiddles that Guy Jerry Alison. Um,

462
00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:11.160
I just loved the way he plays on that fucking song.

463
00:27:11.730 --> 00:27:13.380
She's playing paradiddles around the kid.

464
00:27:13.381 --> 00:27:17.550
He's got the snares off and I love about wherever the music's going, if it's,

465
00:27:17.551 --> 00:27:20.280
you know, just playing those basic, was it two chords? I don't know.

466
00:27:20.281 --> 00:27:25.140
Shit about guitar, the bright accord, he's up on a higher note or whatever.

467
00:27:25.141 --> 00:27:26.970
He's on the Higher Tom and then he goes to the floor.

468
00:27:26.971 --> 00:27:28.890
Tom then occasionally comes back to the snare.

469
00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:33.000
It's just a fucking beautiful piece of music, you know. And um,

470
00:27:33.030 --> 00:27:37.380
I'm learning this shit right now with my drum. Teach Ya,

471
00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:38.850
um,

472
00:27:38.850 --> 00:27:42.870
about how to finally get my paradiddles and shit and playing singles and doubles

473
00:27:42.871 --> 00:27:43.621
going in and out,

474
00:27:43.621 --> 00:27:47.910
getting them up to speed while being totally relaxed and letting the stick do

475
00:27:47.911 --> 00:27:48.570
the work.

476
00:27:48.570 --> 00:27:52.980
And it's the hardest mother fucking thing in the world because you've,

477
00:27:53.040 --> 00:27:56.850
you already can play it up to a certain speed,

478
00:27:57.570 --> 00:28:02.570
just your own fucked up technique way to just say fuck all of that and drop like

479
00:28:03.451 --> 00:28:08.190
a hundred bpms, you know, and start all over again is a,

480
00:28:08.191 --> 00:28:12.330
is a bitch. But if, uh, if you stick with it, um,

481
00:28:13.020 --> 00:28:14.100
it gets, I am not gonna lie to you.

482
00:28:14.101 --> 00:28:16.890
It gets pretty fucking exciting where all of a sudden it's just like, wow,

483
00:28:17.970 --> 00:28:21.060
I don't even feel like I'm, I'm exerting any effort whatsoever.

484
00:28:21.061 --> 00:28:24.840
And I'm like three quarters up to what used to be my full speed.

485
00:28:26.130 --> 00:28:28.800
Um, I dunno. It's exciting shit. So by the way, you know,

486
00:28:28.801 --> 00:28:32.460
now that I've got the Kiddo, my lovely daughter, um,

487
00:28:32.550 --> 00:28:33.960
who every time I think I can't,

488
00:28:34.140 --> 00:28:37.230
I'm not gonna like you don't think the loves can go any further.

489
00:28:38.070 --> 00:28:42.390
They develop more and more of their personality comes out. You're like,

490
00:28:42.420 --> 00:28:46.020
oh my God, she does that. And then it just goes to a whole level.

491
00:28:46.050 --> 00:28:51.000
Like now she's smiling like you can't believe. Um,

492
00:28:52.140 --> 00:28:56.520
and the other day I was sitting there, I was with her and a diapers clean.

493
00:28:56.970 --> 00:28:59.550
She's got a full belly. I'm holding her,

494
00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:02.760
I'm doing all this shit that usually stops her from crying and she's just being

495
00:29:02.761 --> 00:29:06.570
cranky and crying. I was just like, what the fuck could this possibly be?

496
00:29:06.571 --> 00:29:10.020
And that's my favorite part about being a parent right now is trying to figure

497
00:29:10.021 --> 00:29:13.680
out the, the riddle, like what's going on with her.

498
00:29:13.681 --> 00:29:16.320
And you know what I figured out for all you guys with newborns, you know,

499
00:29:16.321 --> 00:29:18.900
that it's starting to develop out there. You know what I figured out?

500
00:29:18.901 --> 00:29:22.800
I was like, she's fucking bored. I'm doing the same shit.

501
00:29:22.950 --> 00:29:27.510
And this shit was interesting for about a week to 10 days and now she's over it

502
00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:30.960
because she's hit a new level of consciousness, you know,

503
00:29:30.961 --> 00:29:33.600
she could see a little bit better, whatever, hear a little bit better.

504
00:29:33.900 --> 00:29:37.350
She started understand all those on my feet, you know, she needs something else.

505
00:29:37.890 --> 00:29:41.680
So, um, you know, we do like this tummy time thing,

506
00:29:41.681 --> 00:29:44.380
trying to get her to pick up her head and learn how to crawl and stuff.

507
00:29:44.860 --> 00:29:48.220
So I brought her over to the little pad thing and it's this little thing that's

508
00:29:48.221 --> 00:29:50.470
got like, you know, all these little, you know,

509
00:29:50.650 --> 00:29:52.240
rattles and shit hanging down from it.

510
00:29:52.610 --> 00:29:57.610
And I just turned her over onto her back and I had a look at those things and

511
00:29:57.611 --> 00:30:01.450
she just looked up and was completely enamored with them.

512
00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:06.040
And like that's the new thing. Now I put it on a back when she looks at him,

513
00:30:06.041 --> 00:30:08.080
she smiles and I'm like, they're her friends.

514
00:30:08.260 --> 00:30:09.490
And this is the greatest thing ever.

515
00:30:09.820 --> 00:30:13.150
Because up until now I've had to carry around like a Kettlebell everywhere I

516
00:30:13.151 --> 00:30:16.480
went and was, you know, messing with my shoulder and shit. But you know,

517
00:30:16.481 --> 00:30:19.900
you love your kids, see like, fuck the shoulder, the shoulder comes, I distant,

518
00:30:20.890 --> 00:30:25.240
you know, 20th in this race, you know, for the first 19 spots and my daughter,

519
00:30:25.241 --> 00:30:27.640
right? So, um,

520
00:30:27.700 --> 00:30:32.700
now what's great is I can just bring that tummy time thing into where I'm

521
00:30:34.541 --> 00:30:37.060
watching sports. I put her on her back,

522
00:30:37.210 --> 00:30:42.040
she's looking at the fucking her friends hanging and I can sit on the couch and

523
00:30:42.041 --> 00:30:45.880
keep that thing moving with my bass drum foot. Right as I'm watching,

524
00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:49.000
as I'm watching the games, it's like the greatest thing ever.

525
00:30:49.001 --> 00:30:51.790
I watched like a whole first half of 'em,

526
00:30:52.630 --> 00:30:56.030
Northwestern Gonzaga. I just sitting there and doing that movement.

527
00:30:56.300 --> 00:30:57.130
It's the greatest thing ever.

528
00:30:57.130 --> 00:31:01.240
So if you've got a kid that's crying out there and the diapers clean and

529
00:31:01.241 --> 00:31:03.880
they've, they've done full and all that, maybe they're just bored.

530
00:31:04.270 --> 00:31:08.450
Try something new, some new stimulus. Um, oh, I was so sick. Right.

531
00:31:10.120 --> 00:31:14.260
It's such a luxury to not have to be holding our all every five seconds,

532
00:31:14.261 --> 00:31:14.950
you know what I mean?

533
00:31:14.950 --> 00:31:18.010
Cause I like these little fucking kettlebells and they are hot.

534
00:31:18.190 --> 00:31:22.120
They're hot as hell. They like this hot water bottle, you know,

535
00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:25.270
they getting all hot. You're getting all fuck. It's just awful. It's like,

536
00:31:25.271 --> 00:31:27.580
you see, it's like you're stuck in a crowded elevator.

537
00:31:31.660 --> 00:31:34.300
Uh, yeah. I feel like I'm going through menopause. It's like,

538
00:31:34.370 --> 00:31:38.590
do the fucking hot flashes here. Hot flashes. Um, anyways,

539
00:31:39.640 --> 00:31:41.650
so let's do a, let's do a little bit of a,

540
00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:46.850
let me read some of the advertising air. Everybody, the a the advertiser.

541
00:31:46.851 --> 00:31:49.960
What am I doing? I just, I just opened the maps. Why would I do that? All right.

542
00:31:50.410 --> 00:31:53.200
Oh, dirty lemon. You know, I finally tried some of this stuff.

543
00:31:53.201 --> 00:31:56.020
It takes a second. It kind of tastes like shit a little bit with a Lew,

544
00:31:56.021 --> 00:32:00.610
the lemon, cause it's got the fucking shock all in there. But once you drink it,

545
00:32:01.780 --> 00:32:04.240
um, you know, it's all right. But it also says on the side of the bottle,

546
00:32:04.241 --> 00:32:08.890
this has not been tested or approved by the food and Drug Administration.

547
00:32:09.260 --> 00:32:09.911
So I was kind of like,

548
00:32:09.911 --> 00:32:13.900
what the fuck am I putting in my body to be honest with you? But you know,

549
00:32:13.930 --> 00:32:18.640
here's their advertising. Just being honest, dirty lemon, everybody.

550
00:32:20.980 --> 00:32:24.940
Um, evidently I've been seeing these stripe dirty lemon bottles everywhere.

551
00:32:24.970 --> 00:32:28.420
I haven't. And now I have them in my fridge. I do.

552
00:32:29.050 --> 00:32:34.050
Dirty lemon is a functional beverage brand with products with optimize various

553
00:32:34.901 --> 00:32:36.970
areas of your life, like vitamin water,

554
00:32:36.971 --> 00:32:40.670
but without the added colors slash sugar.

555
00:32:40.970 --> 00:32:43.940
Plus the products actually work well. Maybe that's why it tastes like shit.

556
00:32:43.941 --> 00:32:48.020
They took the sugar out of it. Uh, there are three types now. Sleep, detox,

557
00:32:48.080 --> 00:32:51.230
skin plus hair. Jesus, I need the last one like a fucking,

558
00:32:51.620 --> 00:32:55.460
I needed this 10 years ago and each one contains the juice of one lemon.

559
00:32:55.461 --> 00:33:00.461
No sugar is blended with functional ingredients that actually work there.

560
00:33:00.481 --> 00:33:03.980
Sleep drink for example, includes magnesium, rose water,

561
00:33:05.490 --> 00:33:09.900
camel meal and passion flower, all which help? No wonder it tastes like shit.

562
00:33:09.901 --> 00:33:10.890
I'm drinking flowers here,

563
00:33:11.100 --> 00:33:14.550
which helps you fall asleep fast and stay asleep through the night.

564
00:33:15.540 --> 00:33:19.320
Evidently I drank one the other night before bed and had crazy dreams.

565
00:33:19.890 --> 00:33:23.430
Talk about the dreams to these guys at weird. I didn't drink this shit.

566
00:33:23.431 --> 00:33:25.740
I want to drink so that makes me have crazy dreams.

567
00:33:26.460 --> 00:33:28.530
You know that I'm going to have a crazy fucking dream.

568
00:33:28.920 --> 00:33:32.690
And the detox is secretly is a secretly great hangover. Cure.

569
00:33:32.700 --> 00:33:37.080
Drink a bottle and the debated charcoal absorbs toxins in your body.

570
00:33:37.680 --> 00:33:40.890
Great. After a long night out. All right. Male Shit. I could have used that.

571
00:33:40.891 --> 00:33:42.120
The, I should have drank that today.

572
00:33:43.370 --> 00:33:43.530
<v 3>Okay.</v>

573
00:33:43.530 --> 00:33:45.870
<v 1>You know, I know I said I was going to stop boozing, but I got a problem.</v>

574
00:33:45.871 --> 00:33:50.390
So I drank the whole night, but I cut the BU's way down. Whey the fuck down.

575
00:33:50.391 --> 00:33:53.090
You know what I mean? Like when you phase in somebody out of your life,

576
00:33:53.091 --> 00:33:55.250
but they're kind of a cycle you get, you can't do it abruptly.

577
00:33:55.251 --> 00:33:58.640
You gotta kind of a sort of waltzed them over to somebody else. All right,

578
00:33:58.641 --> 00:34:00.270
call to action. Uh,

579
00:34:00.380 --> 00:34:03.320
the best part about dirty lemon is that there's only one way to order is via

580
00:34:03.321 --> 00:34:07.160
text message. You'll never find it in stores to or to go to dirty lemon.com.

581
00:34:07.370 --> 00:34:08.570
Register your mobile number,

601
00:35:18.240 --> 00:35:22.500

602
00:35:22.501 --> 00:35:26.760

00:35:38.250 --> 00:35:41.250
<v 1>sake. What are the different jerseys mean? What do they mean?</v>

609
00:35:42.530 --> 00:35:45.180

613
00:35:55.380 --> 00:35:58.560
I got to learn about Jesus to find out what the Mer Tour de France jerseys.

614
00:35:59.640 --> 00:36:01.350

615
00:36:03.740 --> 00:36:08.510
Cycling Jersey. Okay. All right.

616
00:36:09.620 --> 00:36:13.010
Where's the polka.one? Oh, it's red polka dot.

617
00:36:15.020 --> 00:36:16.010
What does that one mean?

618
00:36:16.970 --> 00:36:21.860
Red Polka Dot Jersey means all you went up the mountain.

619

Do you think you could have a fucking fight to the death naked?

631
00:37:05.360 --> 00:37:06.181
Do you think you would like,

632
00:37:06.181 --> 00:37:09.200
I would be so self conscious that my junk was hanging out.

633
00:37:09.440 --> 00:37:13.740
Like if you find your underwear you'd be fine cause you feel like it,

634
00:37:13.770 --> 00:37:17.330
that it's covered up. Psychologically it's covered up. You know what I mean?

635
00:37:18.950 --> 00:37:22.250
But I mean despite the fact that somebody needs you in the balls,

636
00:37:23.180 --> 00:37:27.920
EBV had on fucking, you know, Jay Leno, fucking dad jeans,

637
00:37:28.070 --> 00:37:32.900
it's still going to hurt. Just pretty much just the same. But have you have,

638
00:37:32.901 --> 00:37:34.460
you have fucking underwear on. It's still gonna hurt.

639
00:37:34.461 --> 00:37:38.180
But for such psychologically, if you fought naked, I don't think he could do it.

640
00:37:38.630 --> 00:37:40.830
You know what I mean? It takes a special someone to just be like, yeah,

641
00:37:40.831 --> 00:37:41.900
you know, you know what it is.

642
00:37:41.960 --> 00:37:45.200
It's those guys that get hookers that already let them kick them in the balls.

643
00:37:45.201 --> 00:37:48.920
You ever seen those guys? If you ever seen those fucking porno videos? I have.

644
00:37:49.370 --> 00:37:50.780
They just booted right in the balls.

It's one of the funniest things you're ever gonna Watch.

646

Um, I dunno, I vote for that funniest porn out there.

647
00:38:00.260 --> 00:38:04.370
Is that a subset of comedy? Funniest Porn? I would say that.

648
00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:09.110
And then those ones where the girls like make the choking sound on the Dick.

649
00:38:09.410 --> 00:38:13.050
You know, if the guy's banging her and he's just cause she's going, Oh la, la,

650
00:38:13.120 --> 00:38:15.080
la, la, like that. There's no way.

651
00:38:15.890 --> 00:38:19.370
There's no way to not just burst out laughing. I mean it's like three stooges.

652
00:38:19.371 --> 00:38:22.940
Like shrimp could make a funny noise than that. Anyways,

653
00:38:22.941 --> 00:38:25.340

664
00:39:03.231 --> 00:39:06.580

665

and it fucking goes to your phone and you had the guy's number and you could

729
00:42:52.731 --> 00:42:56.000
fucking call them up after you called the cops. He called him up, be like, hey,

730
00:42:56.630 --> 00:43:01.430
a rental orange off James Simpson. Listen, Nah, Nah, dude, Nah, no, no.

731
00:43:01.431 --> 00:43:03.860
We're all good. We're all good. You sound weird, dude. Are you okay?

732
00:43:03.980 --> 00:43:07.430
You got a weird sound of your voice? Yeah, I'm still in the Cayman Islands.

733
00:43:07.670 --> 00:43:11.750
Guess what buddy? Guess what I got simply safe.

734
00:43:12.590 --> 00:43:13.370
What is that?

735
00:43:13.370 --> 00:43:17.480
It's the security system that just filmed your fucking psycho ass breaking into

736
00:43:17.481 --> 00:43:22.330
my apartment. The cops are pulling up right now, OJ.

737
00:43:22.540 --> 00:43:25.190
Huh? What do you got to say about that? All right. Hey,

744
00:43:49.660 --> 00:43:53.840
It's stamps.com everybody. Do you still go to the post office?

745
00:43:54.080 --> 00:43:57.920
Oh my God, that's so 2012 you know something?

746
00:43:57.921 --> 00:44:02.660
I use stamps.com anytime I'm, you know, anytime I'm selling posters and I need,

747
00:44:02.661 --> 00:44:04.490
you know, whore myself out at the end of the fucking show,

748
00:44:04.491 --> 00:44:06.830
I want to shake some sweaty hands, you know,

749
00:44:07.910 --> 00:44:11.360
look at some gray red wine teeth. That's what I do when I go out there. Listen,

750
00:44:11.450 --> 00:44:14.690
if I can figure it out. So can you, so if stamps can save time,

751

save you time and money, which you can use to grow your business.

752
00:44:18.260 --> 00:44:19.460
I can mail a letter,

753
00:44:19.520 --> 00:44:24.350
any package using just my computer and my brand and the mailman comes and picks

754
00:44:24.351 --> 00:44:27.050
it up and it is a man actually, actually isn't. It's a woman.

755
00:44:27.290 --> 00:44:30.470
The male woman comes and picks it up. Unlike the post office,

756
00:44:30.471 --> 00:44:32.190
stamps.com never closes.

757

765
00:45:02.190 --> 00:45:06.660

772
00:45:29.970 --> 00:45:31.650
that's the end of you guys listening to me.

773
00:45:31.651 --> 00:45:33.270
Read out loud what least advertising.

774
00:45:34.370 --> 00:45:37.070
Was there anything else I wanted to talk about before I fucking got into the

775
00:45:37.080 --> 00:45:41.630
Goddamn, um, oh yeah, you know something.

776
00:45:41.840 --> 00:45:45.530
I'm going to be in San Jose if anybody knows that good a rehearsal space out

777
00:45:45.531 --> 00:45:49.340
there that has some good sounding drums and I can maybe go over there for a day

778
00:45:49.341 --> 00:45:51.110
or something like that. Cause I don't get to, you know,

779
00:45:51.111 --> 00:45:54.830
I'm always on the practice pads here and I miss playing drums and I'm learning

780
00:45:54.831 --> 00:45:57.560
all this cool shit. And you know the deal, man,

781
00:45:57.770 --> 00:45:59.630
I'd love to get those Fucking v drums.

782
00:45:59.660 --> 00:46:02.600
It'd be nice if they hooked me up with a free one and I could talk to my

783
00:46:02.601 --> 00:46:06.320
listeners about how awesome they were. Wink, wink, nudge, nudge,

784
00:46:07.050 --> 00:46:11.600
gimme the fucking drums. Um, but you know, playing on a real kid,

785
00:46:11.630 --> 00:46:14.330
that's the real deal. You know, I love those electronic kits,

786
00:46:14.420 --> 00:46:16.850
but at the end of the day, they make you sound fucking amazing. You're like,

787
00:46:16.851 --> 00:46:20.330
am I the next John Bonam? I think I am. And then you get behind a real kid.

788
00:46:20.331 --> 00:46:23.750
You're like, oh, wait a minute. I suck. All right.

789
00:46:24.170 --> 00:46:27.410
Donut shop while in San Jose. Hey Bill,

790
00:46:27.440 --> 00:46:29.600
I know you've been in San Jose.

791
00:46:29.810 --> 00:46:34.190
I know you'd be here coming up and I think I know of a spot that's totally your

792
00:46:34.191 --> 00:46:36.890
style. It's called Stan's donuts.

793
00:46:37.580 --> 00:46:39.230
I know you're cutting the carbs and shit,

794
00:46:39.231 --> 00:46:42.110
but God damn is it worth the extra elliptical time.

795
00:46:42.320 --> 00:46:45.830
Just an old school doughnut shop that's been around for decades and it hasn't

796
00:46:45.831 --> 00:46:49.280
changed a bit. None of that crazy soy-based gluten-free,

797
00:46:49.610 --> 00:46:52.910
pomegranate fritter with cruelty free bacon bullshit.

798
00:46:53.120 --> 00:46:54.860
Just the classics chocolate.

799
00:46:55.010 --> 00:46:57.950
Maybe an old fashioned or jelly filled you fucking asshole.

800
00:46:57.951 --> 00:47:00.890
I'm trying to lose weight. Don't tell me about this place,

801
00:47:01.610 --> 00:47:03.560
but holy shit.

802
00:47:04.430 --> 00:47:08.180
The only one you need from Stan's is the plain glaze donut.

803
00:47:09.880 --> 00:47:14.260
I'm going to be there with Dean del Ray. Oh, he's off sugar. So he won't do it.

804
00:47:14.560 --> 00:47:17.470
They will give you a glaze donuts so, so fresh.

805
00:47:17.500 --> 00:47:21.910
It might burn your mouth if you aren't careful and you can see them pulling them

806
00:47:21.911 --> 00:47:26.800
out of their fryer. Just find the counter. Can't be that dude.

807
00:47:26.980 --> 00:47:31.480
My mom used to take me here before school when I was really little and I came

808
00:47:31.481 --> 00:47:34.750
back for the first time in like 15 years the other day and it's even better than

809
00:47:34.751 --> 00:47:38.200
I remembered. Well, you got a little child sense memory going on there.

810
00:47:39.760 --> 00:47:41.140
Oh my God. Do. Why are you doing this to me?

811
00:47:41.150 --> 00:47:45.880
Immediately thought of you and that you'd like the old school feel of the place.

812
00:47:45.881 --> 00:47:50.660
It's like five minutes from the San Jose Improv. Make it happen. Do it for Stan.

813
00:47:52.310 --> 00:47:53.650
<v 0>Oh God. Yeah.</v>

814
00:47:53.880 --> 00:47:57.950
<v 1>Well I can tell you that's definitely happening. Well,</v>

815
00:47:57.951 --> 00:48:01.070
you know what I'm going to do? I'm going to do a tour of of San Jose,

816
00:48:01.071 --> 00:48:03.830
one of my city tours. We're definitely, I'm going to fucking go there.

817
00:48:04.640 --> 00:48:07.760
I'm going to end there eating a fucking donut. Well, maybe I'll start there.

818
00:48:07.761 --> 00:48:10.320
Just hating myself. All right,

819
00:48:13.320 --> 00:48:13.340
Redskins, Redskins.

820
00:48:13.340 --> 00:48:16.310
I'm sitting here listening to your podcast and the fast money past Monday,

821
00:48:16.311 --> 00:48:19.740
and I'm thinking about the Redskins. Keep the name change.

822
00:48:19.741 --> 00:48:23.630
The mascot changed the mascot to a potato.

823
00:48:25.530 --> 00:48:30.300
That's fucking hilarious. But that's not intimidating. You know what I mean?

824
00:48:30.780 --> 00:48:34.320
But Redskins then those, of course the nickname would be the hash browns.

825
00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:38.190
But you know what? You know Hash browns are delicious.

826
00:48:39.630 --> 00:48:41.310
That's fucking hilarious.

827
00:48:42.480 --> 00:48:45.060
I want you know something that's actually fucking brilliant.

828
00:48:45.330 --> 00:48:49.680
So you still call them the Redskins. You change the mass potato, the math,

829
00:48:49.710 --> 00:48:53.940
the mascot, the mashed potatoes, the mascot to a fucking potato.

830
00:48:55.110 --> 00:48:58.590
You know something that's one of the most brilliant fucking ideas I think that's

831
00:48:58.591 --> 00:49:01.290
ever been fucking sent in.

832
00:49:02.070 --> 00:49:05.100
God knows I've never said anything better than that. That's fucking brilliant.

833
00:49:05.580 --> 00:49:07.380
Change it to a fucking potato.

834
00:49:09.740 --> 00:49:12.200
But then what do you have on the side of your helmet then? You know what you do?

835
00:49:12.201 --> 00:49:15.590
You just go back to the old logo with the r on the side

836
00:49:16.920 --> 00:49:21.150
in the feather hanging off is the red skin. Like you peel the potato.

837
00:49:21.151 --> 00:49:23.790
You know the thing when people like they peel and they go all the way around in

838
00:49:23.791 --> 00:49:25.890
a circle, it could be like that

839
00:49:27.970 --> 00:49:31.200
great idea. Then right there. That's a funny motherfucker.

840
00:49:31.210 --> 00:49:33.700
I hope you are very successful in life. Thank you for the uh,

841
00:49:35.780 --> 00:49:37.490
that's fucking right. I didn't ever think of that. And I'm,

842
00:49:37.491 --> 00:49:41.030
I'm slipping as a comedian. All right. The Great Barrier Reef.

843
00:49:43.240 --> 00:49:43.631
By the way,

844
00:49:43.631 --> 00:49:48.160
did you hear Netflix is going to switch from the stars from five stars to thumbs

845
00:49:48.161 --> 00:49:51.550
up, thumbs down. I don't know. Why would you do that?

846
00:49:53.040 --> 00:49:57.150
You know, cause I give, you know, if it's just thumbs up, thumbs down.

847
00:49:57.180 --> 00:50:01.260
It's just such a wide peanut butter and jelly sandwich.

848
00:50:01.320 --> 00:50:06.320
Thumbs up gourmet meal on the French Riviera watching the fucking from a yacht

849
00:50:08.580 --> 00:50:12.840
watching the fucking, the end of a Formula One race in Monaco.

850
00:50:13.410 --> 00:50:17.610
Thumbs up the Godfather. Thumbs up,

851
00:50:17.850 --> 00:50:19.620
meatballs, thumbs up.

852
00:50:20.970 --> 00:50:22.090
<v 0>Do you know what I mean?</v>

853
00:50:23.640 --> 00:50:28.010
<v 1>Drinking orange juice after brushing your teeth. Thumbs down.</v>

854
00:50:28.760 --> 00:50:31.370
Adolf Hitler. Thumbs down.

855
00:50:33.500 --> 00:50:36.230
I guess cause they get the fucking ratings. It doesn't matter.

856
00:50:36.231 --> 00:50:40.860
But I mean I like it. I like, it lets me know, you know,

857
00:50:41.520 --> 00:50:44.550
like, okay, people like this. How much do they like this?

858
00:50:46.810 --> 00:50:49.570
I Dunno. Three stooges, thumbs up, Schindler's list, thumbs up.

859
00:50:49.571 --> 00:50:52.690
I mean it's just a what, what, what does anything mean? Anything after that?

860
00:50:53.350 --> 00:50:57.170
All right, great barrier reef. Hey Billy boy.

861
00:50:58.130 --> 00:51:00.890
Huge fan of the show. Thank you.

862
00:51:01.190 --> 00:51:04.310
Remember you were talking about the Great Barrier Reef a couple of weeks or

863
00:51:05.060 --> 00:51:08.900
months ago. Not really. Not really sure anymore. Too Much Wiedemann anyway,

864
00:51:08.901 --> 00:51:12.560
I saw this on the front page of the New York Times and thought you would enjoy

865
00:51:12.650 --> 00:51:15.880
shitting on Australia some more. I don't like shitting on Australia.

866
00:51:15.881 --> 00:51:16.970
I was just shitting on that guy.

867
00:51:17.120 --> 00:51:20.780
It basically says that huge sections of the Great Barrier Reef that stretch

868
00:51:20.781 --> 00:51:22.040
across hundreds of mile.

869
00:51:22.400 --> 00:51:26.540
We're recently found dead and they were killed by over heated salt water.

870
00:51:26.870 --> 00:51:29.600
I know this is coming from a liberal paper,

871
00:51:29.990 --> 00:51:34.490
but I think it's pretty clear evidence. There is six significant global warming.

872
00:51:34.520 --> 00:51:38.210
Anyway, you fat, a bola written piece of shit.

873
00:51:38.750 --> 00:51:43.100
Love the podcasts and keep on keeping on. Um, yeah,

874
00:51:43.101 --> 00:51:44.840
I gotta be honest with you. I don't want,

875
00:51:44.870 --> 00:51:47.880
I don't read up on a lot of the environmental stuff. Uh,

876
00:51:47.960 --> 00:51:51.560
cause it's too fucking depressing. I love animals, man.

877
00:51:51.561 --> 00:51:52.970
I love the earth man.

878
00:51:52.971 --> 00:51:56.660
I don't want to see fucking sea life dying and all that shit.

879
00:51:57.980 --> 00:52:02.020
Um, I dunno. I Dunno what this is just too many of us.

880
00:52:02.380 --> 00:52:06.930
It's just like I think a plague is coming or,

881
00:52:07.710 --> 00:52:11.040
um, I actually think that the robots,

882
00:52:13.140 --> 00:52:13.973
uh,

883
00:52:14.190 --> 00:52:18.480
will be in control of the upper one percenters and they will gradually take all

884
00:52:18.481 --> 00:52:21.270
of us out. And then what it will be,

885
00:52:21.300 --> 00:52:25.350
will each one of those Illuminati guys will have their own robot

886
00:52:26.880 --> 00:52:29.700
with all the answers. It's every, it's a fucking,

887
00:52:30.420 --> 00:52:32.760
it can play guitar like Jimi Hendrix.

888
00:52:33.780 --> 00:52:36.750
It can design the most beautiful architecture.

889
00:52:37.140 --> 00:52:41.310
It's the greatest farmer. They just, whatever you need it to fucking do,

890
00:52:41.311 --> 00:52:45.030
we can do so you'll never go hungry. You'll always be entertained.

891
00:52:45.720 --> 00:52:49.140
And on top of that, it'll be the best look and chick you've ever seen in life.

892
00:52:49.141 --> 00:52:51.180
And you can fuck his brains out. I mean right there.

893
00:52:51.181 --> 00:52:54.900
If that's not going to be the extinction of all the regular people like,

894
00:52:55.010 --> 00:52:59.010
like myself. I think that that's what's going to happen. And then, um,

895
00:53:00.690 --> 00:53:04.860
the earth will gradually cool, but all of our deaths,

896
00:53:04.861 --> 00:53:08.770
the Great Barrier Reef will come back and I'm,

897
00:53:08.820 --> 00:53:13.380
the upper 1% will have what? They always wanted complete control. Um,

898
00:53:13.410 --> 00:53:16.980
but I actually think they'll get bored after awhile. You know,

899
00:53:17.190 --> 00:53:21.630
there's nobody to oppress. There's nobody looked down on, you know,

900
00:53:21.690 --> 00:53:23.760
that's actually a fascinating fucking movie.

901
00:53:23.761 --> 00:53:27.660
Would it be like there's just no more challenge.

902
00:53:28.800 --> 00:53:33.330
Right. And those robots know how to like, you know,

903
00:53:33.331 --> 00:53:35.250
they can like grow an ear in a petri dish.

904
00:53:35.251 --> 00:53:38.670
Eventually we'll be able to grow all vitals, you know what I mean?

905
00:53:39.330 --> 00:53:41.250
And then you can just live forever.

906
00:53:45.180 --> 00:53:46.030
Uh, what would you do?

907
00:53:47.440 --> 00:53:47.780
<v 3>Okay.</v>

908
00:53:47.780 --> 00:53:50.750
<v 1>What would you do? This is reason why you die. You just run out of shit.</v>

909
00:53:50.780 --> 00:53:54.670
What the fuck would you do? I would just keep learning shit.

910
00:53:55.680 --> 00:53:55.890
<v 3>Okay.</v>

911
00:53:55.890 --> 00:53:57.480
<v 1>It's like all right. For the next 80,</v>

912
00:53:57.481 --> 00:54:01.870
like every 80 years you just picked be in something. Alright.

913
00:54:01.980 --> 00:54:04.200
This 80 years I'm going to be a gearhead.

914
00:54:04.330 --> 00:54:07.440
I'm going to learn how to take a whole fucking car apart. Put it back together,

915
00:54:07.450 --> 00:54:10.740
make it fast, fast and loud. I'll just learn how to do that shit.

916
00:54:11.460 --> 00:54:13.620
I'll have the robot right here. It knows everything.

917
00:54:14.120 --> 00:54:16.890
It'll fucking teach me how to do it. And then once I get it down, you know,

918
00:54:16.891 --> 00:54:19.260
and I do that for awhile. You know?

919
00:54:21.840 --> 00:54:24.660
Fuck it. Learn every instrument. Learn every language.

920
00:54:25.320 --> 00:54:27.450
You're eventually just going to run out of shit to do.

921
00:54:29.990 --> 00:54:32.100
You'd just be looking at your robot. Just going like, dude,

922
00:54:33.420 --> 00:54:36.990
I know this is fucking nuts. I know we've been together now, sweetheart,

923
00:54:37.170 --> 00:54:41.550
for fucking 800 years, but could you do me a favor?

924
00:54:43.080 --> 00:54:46.890
Do you want me to kick you in the balls? Not know, sweetheart. I don't,

925
00:54:47.070 --> 00:54:49.920
it'd be funny if they, even though it looked totally look real,

926
00:54:50.460 --> 00:54:53.340
it totally felt like a real person, but they can never perfect the voice.

927
00:54:53.341 --> 00:54:55.080
So it's still fucking talk like that.

928
00:54:56.300 --> 00:55:01.110
You are the best I've ever had. Just like,

929
00:55:01.111 --> 00:55:06.090
bitch, stop talking. You're killing it for me. Um,

930
00:55:06.450 --> 00:55:11.130
you'd have to just say to the fucking thing, look, 800 years.

931
00:55:11.131 --> 00:55:15.270
Okay. I'm coming up on 800 years. All right.

932
00:55:15.271 --> 00:55:18.810
I've lived more years than Hank Aaron hit home runs.

933
00:55:19.740 --> 00:55:23.850
Could you do me a favor on my 800th birthday?

934
00:55:23.851 --> 00:55:26.400
I know what I want. Okay.

935
00:55:27.120 --> 00:55:29.970
Could you just choke me to death? Please

936
00:55:32.430 --> 00:55:34.830
don't not compute. You know, and it, you just,

937
00:55:34.860 --> 00:55:37.890
they won't kill you and then you're fucking,

938
00:55:38.160 --> 00:55:42.480
your punishment is that you live forever. You know,

939
00:55:42.600 --> 00:55:44.460
you kind of like a vampire at that point,

940
00:55:44.610 --> 00:55:48.840
cause you can kind of seduce any woman you want because they're all going to be,

941
00:55:48.841 --> 00:55:53.700
you know, you're just going to get, but you know what? I bet after awhile,

942
00:55:53.820 --> 00:55:56.730
if you live long enough, you just start banging. You'd have,

943
00:55:56.731 --> 00:56:01.731
you'd make like ugly chick robots and he just banged them cause you was so sick

944
00:56:01.921 --> 00:56:06.150
of bang intense. I mean, it's a fucking, it's a hell of a, God damn it.

945
00:56:07.350 --> 00:56:09.480
I don't think human beings can survive in that. Just,

946
00:56:09.481 --> 00:56:11.820
you just think of all the shit that that's gonna happen.

947
00:56:14.420 --> 00:56:17.090
Alright, female comedians. What the fuck is this?

948
00:56:17.091 --> 00:56:20.900
I didn't know this was coming up. All right. Hey Baby Daddy,

949
00:56:20.901 --> 00:56:22.820
Billy boy emailing from Dublin,

950
00:56:23.980 --> 00:56:27.170
a big fan of the podcast to stand up.

951
00:56:27.190 --> 00:56:30.400
I've been watching a lot of stand up specials over the last month.

952
00:56:30.850 --> 00:56:35.850
Recently I'm making a concentrated effort to watch female comedians because all

953
00:56:36.370 --> 00:56:39.250
the Comedians I'm a fan of are men.

954
00:56:39.970 --> 00:56:43.750
Unfortunately I've struggled to find many who meet the mark.

955
00:56:44.260 --> 00:56:48.580
I just watched so-and-so's Netflix special, which was hilarious. Okay,

956
00:56:48.581 --> 00:56:50.500
then I'm going to say the name Kathleen Madigan. Yes.

957
00:56:50.501 --> 00:56:54.280
She's the fucking real deal and she's a total hot shit. I love her.

958
00:56:55.180 --> 00:56:58.450
She's been fucking crushing it since, since I started.

959
00:57:00.190 --> 00:57:05.080
Um, English comedian Joe Brand was also excellent, although I dunno if she's,

960
00:57:05.260 --> 00:57:10.260
she's still active beyond all the others I've seen.

961
00:57:11.260 --> 00:57:14.790
All the other had been shit in my opinion. Uh,

962
00:57:14.800 --> 00:57:18.550
my issue with this disparities that I don't think men are funnier than women in

963
00:57:18.551 --> 00:57:20.980
general. The women in my life, like my girlfriend,

964
00:57:20.981 --> 00:57:24.460
my sister and friends are just as funny as my guy friends. In your experience,

965
00:57:24.610 --> 00:57:28.080
which you find male comedians funny or like myself is,

966
00:57:28.081 --> 00:57:30.250
so why do you believe this is the case?

967
00:57:30.580 --> 00:57:35.140
Could it be the fact that the industry is so male heavy or women comedians

968
00:57:35.141 --> 00:57:37.990
trying too hard to emulate their male counterparts?

969
00:57:38.440 --> 00:57:41.800
These are all questions I can't answer. I don't fucking,

970
00:57:41.830 --> 00:57:45.250
I don't know what the deal is. Again, it's all your opinion. Um,

971
00:57:45.280 --> 00:57:46.900
maybe I'm just an ignorant prick,

972
00:57:46.901 --> 00:57:50.650
but I feel like there's a female perspective in comedy that would speak to me

973
00:57:50.651 --> 00:57:55.600
that isn't met by the better known female comedians. Either way.

974
00:57:55.601 --> 00:57:56.590
Thanks for the laughs.

975
00:57:56.591 --> 00:58:01.240
Congrats to you in the lovely Nia on the little baby bird. Go Fuck Yourself.

976
00:58:01.930 --> 00:58:04.960
Um, I dunno dude. It's like, you know, you know what it is.

977
00:58:04.970 --> 00:58:06.490
I just think it's like bands. You,

978
00:58:06.850 --> 00:58:09.650
you're into a certain style of music and the other shit doesn't speak to you.

979
00:58:10.210 --> 00:58:14.770
CDOT. You don't go to that. But every once in a while there's a band, you know?

980
00:58:14.771 --> 00:58:17.860
Oh fuck. I didn't think I liked country music. I like this country music.

981
00:58:17.861 --> 00:58:21.220
I just think, uh, I dunno what the deal is.

982
00:58:22.480 --> 00:58:26.770
I don't know why there's so much of that fucking talk. My Shit is this okay.

983
00:58:26.771 --> 00:58:31.120
If you're fucking funny, you're funny. If you're not funny,

984
00:58:31.240 --> 00:58:36.160
you're not funny. Okay? And it's not the crowds fault. It's not this,

985
00:58:36.161 --> 00:58:39.400
it's not the fucking Martians. It's your not funny.

986
00:58:40.660 --> 00:58:45.310
And one of the things I found with people, male and female, who aren't funny,

987
00:58:45.910 --> 00:58:50.290
is they fucking got every God damn excuse in the book. And I just want to say,

988
00:58:50.291 --> 00:58:51.124
hey,

989
00:58:52.570 --> 00:58:57.570
just go on stage and fucking kill and all your problems will be solved.

990
00:59:00.610 --> 00:59:04.450
Go on stage and fucking kill. That's what it was. You know,

991
00:59:04.480 --> 00:59:07.300
that's what it's always been. If you do that,

992
00:59:07.450 --> 00:59:10.960
all of these fucking issues that everybody all is this over here,

993
00:59:10.961 --> 00:59:14.980
there's that over here, there's a fucking liberal bias. There's all of this.

994
00:59:15.160 --> 00:59:18.460
It's all fucking bullshit. If you go on stage and you fucking kill,

995
00:59:18.700 --> 00:59:23.640
you're going to get work. That's it. That's it. So I don't, I dunno,

996
00:59:23.970 --> 00:59:28.740
whatever. I'm, I'm so fucking sick of all, all of that. Uh, you know,

997
00:59:28.980 --> 00:59:32.460
our women funny I blah, Blah Blah. And so just lump everybody into a group.

998
00:59:34.190 --> 00:59:36.440
I is more just asked me, do you,

999
00:59:36.620 --> 00:59:39.470
do you think Kathleen Madigan's funny just asked me that in that email.

1000
00:59:39.471 --> 00:59:43.100
I think she's fucking hilarious. I love her delivery and you know,

1001
00:59:43.101 --> 00:59:45.920
I love about her. She can just stand there and be funny.

1002
00:59:45.921 --> 00:59:48.380
I got to jump around screaming, yell, Acts Shit out.

1003
00:59:48.500 --> 00:59:52.670
She can just stand there and fucking murder for an hour.

1004
00:59:52.730 --> 00:59:55.100
And you know what's great too is you meet her and she's totally down to earth

1005
00:59:55.101 --> 00:59:56.660
and she's fucking awesome. So there you go.

1006
00:59:57.200 --> 01:00:00.380
That's the positive way of me getting out of that type of shit cause I'm not

1007
01:00:00.381 --> 01:00:01.820
walking into that like,

1008
01:00:01.980 --> 01:00:06.110
why the fuck do you think I would answer any of that shit? You know what I mean?

1009
01:00:07.580 --> 01:00:09.680
Look what business are you in? Okay.

1010
01:00:09.681 --> 01:00:13.730
Why don't you shit on some people in your fucking your fucking arena.

1011
01:00:14.210 --> 01:00:17.660
I don't want to do that. That's cannibalistic. Um,

1012
01:00:20.490 --> 01:00:22.680
oh my God. I mean there's, there's so many fun. I do.

1013
01:00:22.681 --> 01:00:25.200
I kind of like name funny female comics for you.

1014
01:00:25.260 --> 01:00:28.530
Is that what I got to fucking do now? I got to do your fucking homework.

1015
01:00:28.980 --> 01:00:32.730
All right. Feeling in love with my best. Uh, with my lesbian best friend.

1016
01:00:33.180 --> 01:00:36.150
Hey Billy Dad bought. Oh Jesus, you're so fucking right.

1017
01:00:36.540 --> 01:00:38.340
I'm a huge fan of all your shit.

1018
01:00:39.850 --> 01:00:42.440
<v 4>Why are you calling it show? I'm an artist.</v>

1019
01:00:43.540 --> 01:00:46.120
<v 1>I loved your new special. I need some advice.</v>

1020
01:00:46.840 --> 01:00:50.830
I'm a young guy and I haven't even tried to get into a relationship in a few

1021
01:00:50.830 --> 01:00:54.730
years because my last one turned into a fucking nightmare. Anyways,

1022
01:00:54.731 --> 01:00:56.080
over the past year,

1023
01:00:56.770 --> 01:01:00.790
I've been hanging out with this lesbian and we've grown close. Uh,

1024
01:01:01.330 --> 01:01:03.820
Jesus doing this is gonna. This is the ultimate.

1025
01:01:04.750 --> 01:01:06.340
This is the ultimate just,

1026
01:01:07.530 --> 01:01:07.910
<v 3>yeah,</v>

1027
01:01:07.910 --> 01:01:11.810
<v 1>cold case file. Dude's you chasing the chase and leads that aren't even there.</v>

1028
01:01:12.470 --> 01:01:14.180
She's amazing and my best friend.

1029
01:01:14.181 --> 01:01:18.770
The problem is I find myself growing more and more attracted toward by the day.

1030
01:01:19.040 --> 01:01:20.950
We've talked about having a threesome.

1031
01:01:22.460 --> 01:01:22.560
<v 4>Woo.</v>

1032
01:01:22.560 --> 01:01:24.720
<v 1>Which makes me think she might want to fuck me,</v>

1033
01:01:24.721 --> 01:01:29.460
but doesn't want to admit it to herself. Oh, strike everything that I just said.

1034
01:01:29.461 --> 01:01:34.290
Dude, you, you have fucking walked into paradise. I am happy for you,

1035
01:01:34.291 --> 01:01:38.790
my friend. God bless you. God fucking bless you.

1036
01:01:38.820 --> 01:01:41.430
I hope this fucking turns out the way I think it's going to.

1037
01:01:41.431 --> 01:01:45.450
I'm so you just made the rest of my day that someone's in this situation right

1038
01:01:45.451 --> 01:01:46.284
now.

1039
01:01:47.630 --> 01:01:50.990
Lately she's been trying to get me a girlfriend, probably.

1040
01:01:50.991 --> 01:01:55.370
So there's sexual tension can be redirected. What the fuck do I do, Bill?

1041
01:01:55.670 --> 01:01:58.880
Please help me and go fuck yourself. But what do I do, dude,

1042
01:01:58.881 --> 01:02:02.630
I've never been in this situation. I'm living vicariously through you.

1043
01:02:02.660 --> 01:02:04.400
What do you do? Don't fuck it up.

1044
01:02:05.450 --> 01:02:05.740
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

1045
01:02:05.740 --> 01:02:06.700
<v 1>Dude. Okay. Wait a minute.</v>

1046
01:02:06.760 --> 01:02:09.460
Who's been in this situation and don't fucking lie to me.

1047
01:02:09.640 --> 01:02:13.870
Sending what this guy can do so he doesn't fuck this up. Oh Dude,

1048
01:02:14.920 --> 01:02:19.830
God fucking bless you. Uh, what do you do?

1049
01:02:20.220 --> 01:02:22.500
Um, oh Jesus. What? Okay. What the fuck would I do?

1050
01:02:25.190 --> 01:02:28.100
I Dunno, man. I, I, you know what I would do? I'd go out drinking with her,

1051
01:02:28.220 --> 01:02:32.930
right? And uh, I would fucking say, all right, just pick somebody out.

1052
01:02:33.320 --> 01:02:37.280
Who Do you like? You go up, you strike a conversation. You know what I mean?

1053
01:02:37.730 --> 01:02:40.430
Maybe she strikes up the conversation so the fucking, the, the,

1054
01:02:40.431 --> 01:02:44.230
the other lady keeps it to Defensive Shield down, you know? Okay,

1055
01:02:44.240 --> 01:02:46.520
this is what you do. Do you get into great fucking shape? Okay?

1056
01:02:46.640 --> 01:02:48.890
You got to help out your lesbian girlfriend. Okay?

1057
01:02:49.040 --> 01:02:51.320
You get yourself a new fucking wardrobe.

1058
01:02:51.480 --> 01:02:53.090
You gotta look right when you're going out.

1059
01:02:53.120 --> 01:02:56.120
You put on a pair of fucking me on this. Okay?

1060
01:02:56.360 --> 01:02:59.480
You eat blue apron for a god damn month. You shed some fucking pounds.

1061
01:02:59.481 --> 01:03:02.030
You put on some B on these, you dress fucking right. Okay.

1062
01:03:02.150 --> 01:03:04.790
Give you a lesbian friend, something to work with other. Any Lesbians?

1063
01:03:05.060 --> 01:03:07.460
Listen to this fucking podcast. How does this go down?

1064
01:03:08.420 --> 01:03:09.253
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1065
01:03:10.460 --> 01:03:11.293
<v 1>Hey, yeah.</v>

1066
01:03:14.610 --> 01:03:15.443
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1067
01:03:16.070 --> 01:03:20.480
<v 1>Fuck. Maybe she knows. Hang on a sec. Let me hit pause.</v>

1068
01:03:22.160 --> 01:03:23.330
You know what I realized? You know,

1069
01:03:23.331 --> 01:03:27.390
I realize she's going to come in here holding my daughter and we,

1070
01:03:27.391 --> 01:03:30.170
we can't talk about this shit when she's here. All right,

1071
01:03:30.230 --> 01:03:32.720
well I'm going gonna have to put this, this one I can't do okay. And I went to,

1072
01:03:32.721 --> 01:03:34.670
Oh fuck the podcast. She's never going to be on again.

1073
01:03:34.671 --> 01:03:38.480
Now my daughter's developing, eventually she'll be playing with toys.

1074
01:03:38.481 --> 01:03:41.230
She can sneak in here and, and she can, she can answer some goddamn questions.

1075
01:03:41.300 --> 01:03:44.120
All right. There you go. Um, or

1076
01:03:45.940 --> 01:03:49.510
I don't know how to do it anyways to just, I don't know what to tell you, dude.

1077
01:03:49.540 --> 01:03:53.350
I'm so fucking excited. I can't even think straight right now. God bless you.

1078
01:03:53.530 --> 01:03:57.430
I hope this fucking works out, man. And I, I want,

1079
01:03:57.431 --> 01:04:00.790
I want to hear the fucking story. Um, okay lady.

1080
01:04:00.791 --> 01:04:02.770
She's been trying to get me a girlfriend probably.

1081
01:04:02.771 --> 01:04:07.360
So this sexual tension can be redirected. Yeah. Uh, you know,

1082
01:04:07.361 --> 01:04:10.810
so basically every once in a while she doesn't mind banging a guy.

1083
01:04:11.260 --> 01:04:13.270
As long as there's a, you know, you know what it's like.

1084
01:04:13.271 --> 01:04:14.770
It's like you're going out to a restaurant, right?

1085
01:04:14.890 --> 01:04:15.910
She's going to order one thing.

1086
01:04:15.911 --> 01:04:17.740
You're going to wear the other thing when she's going to take a couple of

1087
01:04:17.741 --> 01:04:19.750
fucking, you know, a couple of spoonfuls off of your plate.

1088
01:04:20.140 --> 01:04:24.180
That's what's going to happen here. Oh my God, this is fucking tremendous.

1089
01:04:25.560 --> 01:04:27.690
Fucking tremendous. God bless you, dude. I have no advice.

1090
01:04:27.880 --> 01:04:30.900
