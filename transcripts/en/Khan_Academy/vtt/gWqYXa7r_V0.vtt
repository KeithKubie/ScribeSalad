00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:01.327
- [Voiceover] We're asked to move

00:00:01.327 --> 00:00:05.503
the orange dot to 5.90 on the number line,

00:00:05.503 --> 00:00:08.382
or you could view this as 5 90/100,

00:00:08.382 --> 00:00:11.075
or 5 9/10.

00:00:11.075 --> 00:00:14.071
All right, so let's see, this is 5.8,

00:00:14.071 --> 00:00:17.228
and then this is 6.0.

00:00:17.228 --> 00:00:18.622
One way to think about it is

00:00:18.622 --> 00:00:21.348
5.9 is exactly halfway

00:00:21.348 --> 00:00:23.948
between 5.8 and 6.0,

00:00:23.948 --> 00:00:26.085
and this is written as 5.90,

00:00:26.085 --> 00:00:28.267
but we could view this as 5.9,

00:00:28.267 --> 00:00:32.052
so it's going to be exactly halfway.

00:00:32.052 --> 00:00:35.528
Now, one interesting
thing to think about is

00:00:35.528 --> 00:00:38.364
what do each of these
tick marks represent?

00:00:38.364 --> 00:00:40.848
Well, if this is 5.8, and if 1/10

00:00:40.848 --> 00:00:43.913
higher than 5.8 is 5.9 over here,

00:00:43.913 --> 00:00:46.741
and then 1/10 higher than that is 6.0,

00:00:46.741 --> 00:00:49.565
so from here to here is 1/10,

00:00:49.565 --> 00:00:52.448
and then from here to
here is another 1/10.

00:00:53.982 --> 00:00:55.346
Then they've divided each 1/10

00:00:55.346 --> 00:00:58.746
into one, two, three, four, five,

00:00:58.746 --> 00:01:02.437
six, seven, eight, nine, 10 sections,

00:01:02.437 --> 00:01:05.149
so each of these represent 1/10 of 1/10,

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:07.304
or 1/100, so for example,

00:01:07.304 --> 00:01:09.728
this would be 5.81, 5.82,

00:01:09.728 --> 00:01:13.155
5.83, 5.84, 5.85,

00:01:13.155 --> 00:01:16.336
5.86, 5.87, 5.88,

00:01:16.336 --> 00:01:20.557
5.89, 5.90.

00:01:20.557 --> 00:01:23.320
So either way, I think we got it.

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:25.307
All right, let's keep
doing some more of these.

00:01:26.195 --> 00:01:28.438
Move the orange dot to 2.87

00:01:28.438 --> 00:01:29.622
on the number line.

00:01:29.622 --> 00:01:30.899
All right, this is interesting.

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:32.084
So, this is 2.8.

00:01:32.084 --> 00:01:33.105
That's 3.0.

00:01:33.105 --> 00:01:34.698
Halfway in between would be

00:01:34.698 --> 00:01:36.213
this longer hash mark,

00:01:36.213 --> 00:01:37.811
or this longer tick mark, right over here.

00:01:37.811 --> 00:01:39.993
This would be 2.9.

00:01:39.993 --> 00:01:42.496
So 2.87, this is just like we saw

00:01:42.496 --> 00:01:43.889
in the last example.

00:01:43.889 --> 00:01:45.278
Each of these is 1/100,

00:01:45.278 --> 00:01:48.784
so this is 2.8, this would be 2.81,

00:01:48.784 --> 00:01:52.661
2.82, 2.83, 2.84,

00:01:52.661 --> 00:01:56.395
2.85, 2.86,

00:01:56.395 --> 00:02:00.040
2.87, and we could just check.

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:04.949
This would be 2.88, 2.89, 2.9,

00:02:04.949 --> 00:02:07.410
or 2.90, which is exactly halfway

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:09.337
between 2.8 and 3.0,

00:02:09.337 --> 00:02:10.939
so I'm feeling good about that.

00:02:10.939 --> 00:02:11.961
Let's check our answer.

00:02:11.961 --> 00:02:12.936
We got it right.

00:02:12.936 --> 00:02:14.538
You know, after you get a question right,

00:02:14.538 --> 00:02:15.629
it doesn't hurt to look at the hints

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:16.860
at that point, so let's just see

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.392
how they tackled it.

00:02:18.392 --> 00:02:20.157
So, they say, "Above we've drawn

00:02:20.157 --> 00:02:23.129
"the number line from 2.8 to 3.0,"

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:25.103
and they divided into 20 equal pieces.

00:02:25.103 --> 00:02:27.099
Yup, that looks right.

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:28.446
Let's see their next hint.

00:02:28.446 --> 00:02:30.623
So, they say that piece of the line

00:02:30.623 --> 00:02:32.899
is 3.0 minus 2.8.

00:02:32.899 --> 00:02:34.371
That's gonna be 2/10,

00:02:34.371 --> 00:02:37.459
and then you divide by 20, is 0.1.

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:39.038
So, that's another way that
they're just saying that,

00:02:39.038 --> 00:02:40.854
"Hey, each of these is 1/100,"

00:02:40.854 --> 00:02:41.663
but we already saw that.

00:02:41.663 --> 00:02:44.124
2.81, 2.82, 2.83, 2.84,

00:02:44.124 --> 00:02:46.864
2.85, 2.86, 2.87.

00:02:46.864 --> 00:02:48.234
Let's just do another one.

00:02:48.234 --> 00:02:50.887
The hints actually, I think,
keep going after that.

00:02:50.887 --> 00:02:54.480
So (mumbles) I encourage
you to look at the hints.

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:55.873
See if you can make sense of them

00:02:55.873 --> 00:02:57.986
after you try the exercise.

00:02:57.986 --> 00:03:01.317
So, let's try another one.

00:03:01.317 --> 00:03:03.270
Let's do one more.

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:06.846
Move the orange dot to
0.27 on the number line.

00:03:06.846 --> 00:03:09.925
Well, this is 0.2, this is 0.3,

00:03:09.925 --> 00:03:12.386
so going from here to here is 1/10,

00:03:12.386 --> 00:03:13.919
and then they've divided that 1/10

00:03:13.919 --> 00:03:16.124
into 10 sections, so each of these

00:03:16.124 --> 00:03:19.212
is 1/10 of 1/10, which is 1/100.

00:03:19.212 --> 00:03:22.254
So, this is 2/10 and 0/100,

00:03:22.254 --> 00:03:26.689
2/10 and 1/100, 2/10 and 2/100,

00:03:26.689 --> 00:03:29.986
2/10 and 3/100, 2/10 and 4/100,

00:03:29.986 --> 00:03:32.819
2/10 and 5/100, 2/10 and 6/100,

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:34.932
2/10 and 7/100.

00:03:34.932 --> 00:03:36.836
This is 2/10 and 7/100.

00:03:36.836 --> 00:03:40.319
Another way you could view
it is, this is 20/100.

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:42.571
2/10 is the same thing as 20/100.

00:03:42.571 --> 00:03:45.938
21/100, 22/100, 23/100,

00:03:45.938 --> 00:03:50.507
24/100, 25/100, 26/100,

00:03:50.507 --> 00:03:52.667
27/100.

00:03:52.667 --> 00:03:53.735
All right.

00:03:53.735 --> 00:03:56.121
Check our answer, and
let's just see the hints.

00:03:56.121 --> 00:03:58.165
They say "10 equal pieces."

00:03:58.165 --> 00:03:59.460
They show us that right over here.

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:00.900
They actually labeled it.

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:02.989
Anyway, hopefully this helps.

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:05.924
I encourage you to go try
this exercise out now.
