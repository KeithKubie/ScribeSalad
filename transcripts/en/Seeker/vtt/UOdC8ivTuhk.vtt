00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:03.330
This episode of DNews is brought to you by
the U.S. Air Force.

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:08.380
The scientific method is so good it can turn
a 13 year old who left bananas on the counter

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:18.650
into an international celebrity!

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:23.130
Every year, Google partners with other global
companies and invites kids from all over the

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.160
world to showcase their science prowess at
the Google Science Fair and the 2014 winners

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:33.670
were announced Monday night! I love the Google
Science Fair but it makes me feel super lazy.

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:39.000
It's open to 13-18 year old students who perform
an experiment following the scientific method…

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.710
they just have to upload a video to explain
it!

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:48.940
This year, the grand prize winner is a group
of gals from Ireland! Ciara (Kira) Judge,

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:55.549
Emer Hickey, and Sophie Healy-Thow spent three
years exploring the warts on a pea plant.

00:00:55.549 --> 00:01:00.280
Weird, I know, but good science has humble
beginnings. The three students were learning

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:06.570
about the global food crisis in school, and
found the pea plant's warts contained rhizobia

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:13.039
bacteria; which benefit the plants by creating
ammonia and fixing nitrogen which helps the

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:14.909
plants grow.

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:20.590
These young scientists figured, if rhizobia
helped pea plants it might help others too!

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:25.600
They applied the rhizobia to wheat, oats and
barley and increased germination rates by

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:32.600
50 percent and crop yields by 75 percent!
That's HUGE! And that was three years ago

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:38.420
when they were only 13. Since then they've
applied the rhizobia to 13,000 seeds and created

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:44.560
a control field in their hometown with another
3,600 seeds. Yet another example of the microbiome

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:51.009
of a plant revolutionizing farming without
chemical pesticides or fertilizers. The bacteria

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:55.950
help by reducing the amount of rot that naturally
happens to plant roots in wet climes, like

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:56.950
Ireland!

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:02.289
The 17-18 age group global winner, Haley Todesco
of Canada, created an experiment to see if

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:10.879
her method could better clean oil from sand.
Imagine that, trying to clean toxic waste

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:19.440
from oil sands extraction. Oil sands are a
mixture of sand, clay, water, and petroleum.

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.849
Companies are learning to extract the petroleum
from the sand and clay, but the byproduct

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:30.000
is highly toxic and is usually left in reservoirs
do detoxify for centuries.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.290
Haley grew up in a part of Alberta where these
toxic reservoirs are fairly common. She wanted

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:40.920
to find a way to solve the problem. She drew
inspiration from European sewage systems of

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:47.820
the 19th century, and created bacteria based
biofilms that would eat the acids in the oily

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:54.450
byproduct. She spent two years working on
the filtration system and her hard work paid

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:59.690
off. The bioreactors she created are cheap
and work fourteen times better than the ones

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:05.939
in use today. This project will shorten the
time it takes to detoxify the ponds from "centuries

00:03:05.939 --> 00:03:09.140
to decades," she said.

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:14.400
The third global winner is from the United
States // USA USA USA // Mahir Garimella's

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:19.290
family went on vacation and returned to a
house full of fruit flies! Their mistake proved

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:25.430
fruitful, as Mahir noticed the flies brains
were incredible at 3D navigation and dodging

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:31.579
their attempts to capture them! That's amazing!
A 1 billion neuron mammal can't grab a 1,000

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:36.230
neuron insect? Eureka! Let's learn from this!
From there, 14-year-old Mahir designed a flying

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:41.180
robot based on the cognition of these fruity
flies. He designed a visual module inspired

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:46.690
by the flies' and created algorithms for the
robot's propellers to mimic the escape behaviors

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:48.280
of these tiny pests.

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:51.960
Practically speaking, the work these kids
are doing could quite literally change the

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:57.030
world, they could grow more food, clean up
after dirty energy collection, and help create

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:01.490
stable, affordable flying robots for commercial
and industrial application. Their inspiration

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:04.390
came from everyday things, from school and
from their own silly mistakes… like accidentally

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:05.390
leaving bananas on the counter during a vacation.
Science can from from anywhere, and from anyone.

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:06.390
Don't think I didn't notice that 4 of the
six winners were girls. Nice job ladies, we

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:07.390
need your science brains too! These were just
three of the dozens of projects from all over

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:08.390
the world. Olfactory alarm clocks, computers
that help mute people speak, projects to protect

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:09.390
orangutans, power generation, agriculture,
engineering… these kids are the future,

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:10.390
and it's awesome.

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:11.390
The U. S. Air Force has an eye on the future,
too. I wanna give a quick shout out to them

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:16.500
for making this possible. Fun fact: Air Force
was the first to break the sound barrier in

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:21.040
1947! And has been breaking new barriers in
science and technology ever since.

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:27.700
So did you ever join a science fair? What
was your project? I did a thing about Earthquakes,

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:33.920
and made a diorama and everything! It was
fun, but nothing quite as involved as all

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:39.700
this.
