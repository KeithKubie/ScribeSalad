 This is the Thinkabit Lab.</i>

00:00:50.082 --> 00:00:54.453
<i> It's a dedicated maker space
 for middle school students</i>

00:00:54.453 --> 00:00:56.822 line:0%
to experience work at Qualcomm

00:00:56.822 --> 00:00:58.958 align:start size:84% position:16% line:0%
as well as experiencing
engineering

00:00:58.958 --> 00:01:01.060 line:0%

<i> (woman)
 After a lot of research,</i>

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.866 align:start size:94% position:6%
<i> we found that sixth, seventh,
 and eighth grade students,</i>

00:01:06.866 --> 00:01:10.102
<i> they lose their passion
 for math and science.</i>

00:01:10.102 --> 00:01:12.038 align:start position:0% line:0%
Whether it's
"science isn't cool,"

00:01:12.038 --> 00:01:14.407 align:start position:0% line:0%
especially for girls,
math isn't cool,

00:01:14.407 --> 00:01:17.776
<i>there's a transitional period
between eighth and ninth grade.</i>

00:01:17.776 --> 00:01:21.580 align:start position:0%
<i>So we said, "What if we show
that engineering's fun,</i>

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:23.850
<i>that science and math is fun,</i>

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.884 align:start position:0%
<i>that the concepts

 STEM or STEAM:</i>

00:01:31.123 --> 00:01:33.726 align:start size:69% position:31%
science, technology,
engineering, and math.

00:01:33.726 --> 00:01:37.130 align:start size:75% position:25%
If you add "A,"
you get STEAM, the arts.

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:40.900 align:start size:94% position:6%
<i> Around the Thinkabit Lab,
 you'll see art all around us.</i>

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:42.768 align:start size:72% position:28%
<i> Why should Qualcomm
 do this?</i>

00:01:42.768 --> 00:01:44.737 size:84% position:58%
<i> Well, we're a leader here,</i>

00:01:44.737 --> 00:01:48.274 size:88% position:56%
<i> one of the largest private
 employers in our community.</i>

00:01:48.274 --> 00:01:50.176 align:start size:47% position:53%
<i> It's important

<i> to be connected
 to education.</i>

00:01:52.945 --> 00:01:56.949
More and more, we've heard that
business isn't engaged enough.

00:01:56.949 --> 00:01:59.953
Oftentimes, businesses engage
in the form of check-writing,

00:01:59.953 --> 00:02:04.523 align:start size:94% position:6%
but this is a way to give back
in a personal way.

00:02:04.523 --> 00:02:08.060 align:start position:0% line:0%
They want local San Diegans
to work for Qualcomm.

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.797 align:start position:0% line:0%
<i>Ultimately, they want to ignite
the passion in kids,</i>

00:02:11.797 --> 00:02:14.100 size:88% position:44% line:0%
<i>so we have a similar vision.</i>

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.303 align:start position:0% line:0%
<i>And working alongside people
who are for education,</i>

00:02:17.303 --> 00:02:20.106 align:start position:0%
<i>it's really powerful.</i>

00:02:20.106 --> 00:02:23.876 align:start size:81% position:19%

 Once the kids arrive,
 they have to be quiet</i>

Are you guys excited?

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.359 align:start size:91% position:9%
Yes.

00:02:40.359 --> 00:02:42.995
It's going to be
an awesome day.

00:02:42.995 --> 00:02:47.066 align:start size:97% position:3%
<i> At Qualcomm, 31,000 people
 working on these technologies,</i>

00:02:47.066 --> 00:02:50.503 align:start size:94% position:6%

 are engineers.</i>

00:02:50.503 --> 00:02:53.139 align:start size:84% position:16%
<i> We'll give you
 a taste of engineering</i>

00:02:53.139 --> 00:02:55.275
<i> today at Thinkabit Lab.</i>

00:02:55.275 --> 00:02:58.411 align:start size:53% position:47%
<i> (Hidalgo)
 The question
 we often ask is,</i>

00:02:58.411 --> 00:03:01.681 align:start position:0%
"How do children aspire to
careers they don't know exist?"

00:03:01.681 --> 00:03:05.484 align:start position:0%
We talk about work at Qualcomm
and other big companies,

00:03:05.484 --> 00:03:09.455 align:start position:0%
how their interests and values
map out to these careers.

00:03:09.455 --> 00:03:11.891 size:75% position:38%
<i>And really, we emphasize
engineering, obviously,</i>

00:03:11.891 --> 00:03:13.492 align:start position:0%
<i>being a tech company,</i>

00:03:13.492 --> 00:03:17.663
<i>but here in this space, we
talk about support functions,</i>

00:03:17.663 --> 00:03:19.565 size:81% position:41%
<i>marketing, graphic design,</i>

00:03:19.565 --> 00:03:22.401 align:start position:0%
<i>finance, legal,
business development,</i>

00:03:22.401 --> 00:03:23.736 size:78% position:39%
<i>user-interface designers.</i>

00:03:23.736 --> 00:03:26.005 align:start position:0%
<i>We're starting
to put these words</i>

00:03:26.005 --> 00:03:28.107 size:81% position:41%
<i>into middle school brains,</i>

00:03:28.107 --> 00:03:30.409 size:88% position:44%
<i>and it's really cool to see.</i>

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:33.846 align:start size:75% position:25%
We're not trying to push
kids into STEM fields.

00:03:33.846 --> 00:03:37.483 align:start size:84% position:16%
We do believe that STEM
capability will be critical

00:03:37.483 --> 00:03:41.787 align:start size:94% position:6%
for all workers in the future,
in 21st century careers.

00:03:41.787 --> 00:03:43.089 align:start size:81% position:19%
<i> To understand technology,</i>

00:03:43.089 --> 00:03:45.892 align:start size:75% position:25%
<i> whether you're a lawyer
 or an accountant</i>

00:03:45.892 --> 00:03:48.127 align:start size:66% position:34%
<i> or a human resources
 professional,</i>

00:03:48.127 --> 00:03:51.263 align:start size:84% position:16%
<i> we need to know
 and understand technology.</i>

00:03:51.263 --> 00:03:55.368 align:start position:0%
STEM will influence all careers,
and that's what we encourage.

00:03:55.368 --> 00:03:59.339 align:start position:0%
I like to synchronize the class
before we get started.

00:03:59.339 --> 00:04:04.276
How we do that is we get in
one circle and hold hands.

00:04:04.276 --> 00:04:07.146 align:start position:0%
<i>(Naderi)
We use this giant battery,</i>

00:04:07.146 --> 00:04:11.350 size:88% position:44%
<i>and I explain a circuit only
works as a complete circuit,</i>

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:14.654 size:84% position:42%
<i>so they have to hold hands.</i>

00:04:14.654 --> 00:04:17.957 align:start position:0%
<i>They see immediately
what a complete circuit does</i>

00:04:17.957 --> 00:04:21.794 align:start position:0%
<i>and how, if you let go,
it'll stop working.</i>

00:04:21.794 --> 00:04:24.196 align:start position:0%
<i>That's just how
the circuit works.</i>

00:04:24.196 --> 00:04:25.364 align:start position:0%
Disconnect.

00:04:25.364 --> 00:04:28.200 align:start position:0%
Oh, it is not conductive
through cloth.

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:31.537 align:start position:0%
But it's only because
there's not enough voltage.

00:04:31.537 --> 00:04:35.941 align:start position:0%
If the voltage was higher,
it may be going through cloth.

00:04:35.941 --> 00:04:40.479 size:88% position:44%
The longer one is positive.
The shorter one is negative.

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:43.849 size:78% position:39%
<i>From there, we have them
building a basic circuit,</i>

00:04:43.849 --> 00:04:46.285 size:84% position:42%
<i>which is an LED turning on.</i>

00:04:46.285 --> 00:04:47.920 size:81% position:41%
<i>It's actually really cool.</i>

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:50.189 align:start position:0%
<i>Never underestimate
an LED turning on,</i>

00:04:50.189 --> 00:04:53.692 align:start position:0% line:0%
<i>how exciting that is
for somebody.</i>

00:04:50.189 --> 00:04:53.692 align:start size:31% position:69% line:21%
<i> I did it!</i>

00:04:53.692 --> 00:04:57.029 align:start position:0%
Engineers will come in
'cause they're curious,

00:04:57.029 --> 00:04:58.530 align:start position:0%
<i>so we introduce them.</i>

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:01.233 align:start position:0%
<i>This engineer works
on the Snapdragon chip</i>

00:05:01.233 --> 00:05:03.102 size:88% position:44%
<i>that's in the latest phones,</i>

00:05:03.102 --> 00:05:05.605 align:start position:0%
<i>or who created
the 4K technology.</i>

00:05:05.605 --> 00:05:09.308 align:start position:0%
<i>So really bringing
that kind of abstract idea</i>

00:05:09.308 --> 00:05:13.946 align:start position:0%
<i>of what an engineer is or
who a Qualcomm professional is,</i>

00:05:13.946 --> 00:05:18.217 align:start position:0%
bring them in and say,
"This is what they look like."

00:05:18.217 --> 00:05:21.987 line:0%
There's a difference between me
rambling about jobs and college

00:05:21.987 --> 00:05:24.990 align:start position:0% line:0%
and actually seeing people
who went to college,

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:27.327 align:start position:0%
<i>our engineers
and people like them,</i>

00:05:27.327 --> 00:05:30.329 align:start position:0%
<i>especially having a female
like Sarah at Qualcomm</i>

00:05:30.329 --> 00:05:32.965 align:start position:0%
<i>being the lead engineer
and teaching them.</i>

00:05:32.965 --> 00:05:37.903
<i> That's powerful for girls to
 see that they can do this too.</i>

00:05:37.903 --> 00:05:43.175 align:start position:0%
We get an LED to blink
using the code from the Arduino.

00:05:43.175 --> 00:05:46.144 size:84% position:42%
<i>I like this part of the day</i>

00:05:46.144 --> 00:05:51.950 align:start position:0%
<i>because we not only expose them
to engineering and coding,</i>

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:53.752 align:start position:0%
<i>but also challenge them</i>

00:05:53.752 --> 00:05:56.021 align:start position:0%
<i>with something
they're not familiar with.</i>

00:05:56.021 --> 00:05:59.658 align:start position:0%
That's it.
That is all my code.

00:05:59.658 --> 00:06:03.696 align:start position:0% line:0%
They've learned basics of
the Arduino and the breadboard

00:06:03.696 --> 00:06:05.464 align:start position:0%
<i>and how to code.</i>

00:06:05.464 --> 00:06:09.635 size:78% position:39%
<i>The idea of what was code
was very foreign to them</i>

00:06:09.635 --> 00:06:11.570 align:start position:0%
<i>and understanding
it's just numbers.</i>

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:13.839 align:start position:0%
<i>You're telling
something what to do</i>

00:06:13.839 --> 00:06:16.676 align:start position:0%
<i>and then coding it
into this Arduino</i>

00:06:16.676 --> 00:06:19.478 align:start position:0%
<i>and actually
seeing an LED blink</i>

00:06:19.478 --> 00:06:22.347 align:start position:0%
<i>because you told it
to do that</i>

00:06:22.347 --> 00:06:24.817
<i>really opens a door for them.</i>

00:06:24.817 --> 00:06:27.586 align:start size:34% position:66%
Oh, my God,
it's magic!

00:06:27.586 --> 00:06:30.022 size:81% position:41% line:78%
It's blinking.

00:06:27.586 --> 00:06:30.022 align:start size:56% position:44%
It's magic!

00:06:30.022 --> 00:06:32.491 align:start position:0%
<i>(Naderi)
And they're all exposed to,</i>

00:06:32.491 --> 00:06:35.294 align:start position:0%
<i>that coding can
affect your system,</i>

00:06:35.294 --> 00:06:38.297 align:start position:0%
that it's not as hard
as they thought,

00:06:38.297 --> 00:06:43.569
and that it was a lot more fun
than they thought it would be.

00:06:43.569 --> 00:06:46.906 size:84% position:42%
I get the "I-thought-this-
would-be-boring" impression

00:06:46.906 --> 00:06:51.410 align:start position:0%
and can't tell you how many
times I've heard kids tell me,

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:54.046 align:start position:0%
"This was more fun
than I thought."

00:06:54.046 --> 00:06:58.917
One girl whispered, "I thought I
was going to be a computer nerd.

00:06:58.917 --> 00:07:00.419 align:start position:0%
This is fun."

00:07:00.419 --> 00:07:04.890 align:start position:0%
I was like, "I don't know why
you're whispering, but awesome!"

00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:07.859 size:81% position:59%
So this one is
a regular servo.

00:07:07.859 --> 00:07:10.696 align:start position:0%
<i>From there,
we go into servos immediately</i>

00:07:10.696 --> 00:07:15.567 align:start size:97% position:3%
<i> and try to get both the servos
 to work a full rotation.</i>

00:07:15.567 --> 00:07:18.937
The full rotation goes around.
Regular ones go back and forth.

00:07:18.937 --> 00:07:22.642 align:start size:97% position:3%
<i> And so then after
 that exercise, it's free game.</i>

00:07:22.642 --> 00:07:26.979 align:start position:0%
<i>They choose one servo
and go to the craft store</i>

00:07:26.979 --> 00:07:29.882 align:start position:0%
<i>and actually build out
their entire project.</i>

00:07:29.882 --> 00:07:32.852 align:start position:0%
I'm amazed
what kids come up with.

00:07:32.852 --> 00:07:37.256 align:start position:0%
<i>They don't have limits.
Any product that is worthy</i>

00:07:37.256 --> 00:07:40.092 align:start position:0%
<i>had to go through
some artistic process.</i>

00:07:40.092 --> 00:07:43.662 align:start position:0%
<i>So the powerful thing
about STEAM</i>

00:07:43.662 --> 00:07:45.931 size:84% position:42%
<i>is that the art allows kids</i>

00:07:45.931 --> 00:07:49.001 align:start position:0%
<i>the platform to be
whoever they want.</i>

00:07:49.001 --> 00:07:53.439 align:start position:0%
<i>It's not forcing them
to create a rigid product</i>

00:07:53.439 --> 00:07:55.707 size:84% position:42%
<i>in any way, shape, or form.</i>

00:07:55.707 --> 00:07:59.144 align:start position:0%
<i>To give these kids that
flexibility and empowerment,</i>

00:07:59.144 --> 00:08:02.214 align:start position:0%
<i>it's probably the first time
in their childhood</i>

00:08:02.214 --> 00:08:05.584 align:start size:97% position:3%
<i> that they get to own something
 that's completely theirs.</i>

00:08:05.584 --> 00:08:08.587 align:start position:0%
<i>They got to manifest it
from their imagination</i>

00:08:08.587 --> 00:08:10.389 align:start position:0%
<i>through and through.</i>

00:08:10.389 --> 00:08:12.391
[kids laughing]

00:08:18.897 --> 00:08:21.533 align:start size:69% position:31% line:0%
There's no doubting
the change in students

00:08:21.533 --> 00:08:23.903 align:start size:47% position:53% line:0%
after they come
into the lab.

00:08:23.903 --> 00:08:27.473 align:start size:84% position:16% line:0%
For sure, they didn't think
they would be coding

00:08:27.473 --> 00:08:30.242 align:start size:66% position:34%
<i> or would be creating
 a robotic craft.</i>

00:08:30.242 --> 00:08:32.411 align:start size:75% position:25%
<i> When they exit the lab,</i>

00:08:32.411 --> 00:08:36.215 align:start size:97% position:3%
<i> they are almost more energized
 than when they came in.</i>

00:08:37.282 --> 00:08:40.753
Kids that walk in like this...

00:08:40.753 --> 00:08:42.755 align:start position:0%
"Yeah, I can do that."

00:08:42.755 --> 00:08:45.524 align:start position:0%
And they leave like...

00:08:45.524 --> 00:08:50.162 align:start position:0%
It's like this ginormous smile,
like they are just lit up.

00:08:50.162 --> 00:08:55.233
<i> I think this space can provide
 proof to our peers in society</i>

00:08:55.233 --> 00:08:58.270 size:75% position:38%
<i>that you can ease people</i>

00:08:58.270 --> 00:09:01.540 align:start position:0%
<i>into traditionally difficult
subject matters.</i>

00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:04.309 align:start position:0%
<i>And not only is it fun,</i>

00:09:04.309 --> 00:09:05.811 align:start position:0%
<i>the kids like it,</i>

00:09:05.811 --> 00:09:08.781 align:start size:97% position:3%
<i> the adults putting it together
 like it,</i>

00:09:08.781 --> 00:09:12.651 align:start position:0%
<i>and it really is
a win-win-win situation.</i>

00:09:12.651 --> 00:09:16.422
Many schools have said, "Since
coming to the Thinkabit Lab,

00:09:16.422 --> 00:09:19.057 align:start size:69% position:31%
we're motivated
to create our own lab.

00:09:19.057 --> 00:09:20.559 align:start size:56% position:44%
That was our hope,

00:09:20.559 --> 00:09:23.996 align:start size:88% position:13%
that schools would be
interested to create a space

00:09:23.996 --> 00:09:26.699 align:start size:75% position:25%
dedicated to engineering
and science and coding,

00:09:26.699 --> 00:09:28.968 align:start size:69% position:31%
so students could have
regular accessibility.

00:09:28.968 --> 00:09:30.502 size:88% position:56%
Schools like Monarch School,

00:09:30.502 --> 00:09:33.739 align:start size:66% position:34%
e3 Charter,
Feaster Team Charter,

00:09:33.739 --> 00:09:36.508 align:start size:66% position:34%
those schools
are making inroads

00:09:36.508 --> 00:09:39.178 align:start size:59% position:41%
to create their own
maker spaces.

00:09:40.979 --> 00:09:44.483 align:start size:91% position:9% line:0%
<i> (Motsinger)
 What we're doing at Feaster
 is exciting,</i>

00:09:44.483 --> 00:09:47.086 line:0%
<i>it's innovating, it's engaging,</i>

00:09:47.086 --> 00:09:51.223 size:88% position:44% line:0%
and it's exposing our kids
to a variety of opportunity.

00:09:51.223 --> 00:09:54.960 size:84% position:58%
They wanted to get involved
right from the beginning.

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:57.396 align:start size:66% position:34%
Their superintendent,
their principal,

00:09:57.396 --> 00:09:59.398 align:start size:63% position:38%
their staff
have been phenomenal

00:09:59.398 --> 00:10:02.767 align:start size:91% position:9%
because they've been open
to listening to our thoughts,

00:10:02.767 --> 00:10:05.770 align:start size:72% position:28%
as we've been open
to listening to theirs.

00:10:05.770 --> 00:10:07.573
It's a perfect collaboration.

00:10:07.573 --> 00:10:10.943 align:start position:0%
As we've grown,
we have helped each other both.

00:10:10.943 --> 00:10:15.347 align:start position:0%
They came here and helped us
develop our own engineering lab.

00:10:15.347 --> 00:10:19.685 size:84% position:42%
<i>We are so fortunate to send
some students to Qualcomm,</i>

00:10:19.685 --> 00:10:21.953 size:84% position:42%
<i>but we have 1,200 students,</i>

00:10:21.953 --> 00:10:24.923 align:start size:97% position:3%
<i> and our kindergartners,
 first-graders, second-graders,</i>

00:10:24.923 --> 00:10:28.293 align:start position:0%
<i>all of our kids wanted
to have that experience.</i>

00:10:28.293 --> 00:10:32.431
A lot of what I've been working
with is constructive struggle.

00:10:32.431 --> 00:10:33.666 align:start size:63% position:38%
<i> They have problems.</i>

00:10:33.666 --> 00:10:36.568 align:start size:69% position:31%
<i> Things don't work out
 as planned,</i>

00:10:36.568 --> 00:10:39.972 align:start size:69% position:31%
<i> and so it's how do we
 figure this out</i>

00:10:39.972 --> 00:10:45.444 align:start size:81% position:19%
<i> and trying let them think
 and work through it.</i>

00:10:45.444 --> 00:10:49.548 align:start size:88% position:13%
<i> (girl)
 It gave me a way
 to see things differently</i>

00:10:49.548 --> 00:10:54.653 align:start position:0% line:0%
and to work in hard situations
where you have to show grit

00:10:54.653 --> 00:10:58.857 align:start position:0%
and have another way
to look at things,

00:10:58.857 --> 00:11:02.294 align:start position:0%
instead of being,
"I'm done. I can't do that."

00:11:02.294 --> 00:11:05.297 align:start size:69% position:31% line:0%
I want them to
take away the process.

00:11:05.297 --> 00:11:09.301 align:start size:75% position:25% line:0%
It isn't one thing or
one project or one idea.

00:11:09.301 --> 00:11:13.071 size:88% position:56%
<i> It's more about the process
 that they go about thinking</i>

00:11:13.071 --> 00:11:16.841
<i> because it translates so well
 from what they're doing here</i>

00:11:16.841 --> 00:11:19.378 align:start size:69% position:31%
<i> into real-world,
 real-life situations.</i>

00:11:19.378 --> 00:11:22.981 align:start size:94% position:6%
<i> (girl)
 When you're stuck and see
 somebody building something,</i>

00:11:22.981 --> 00:11:26.352 align:start size:69% position:31% line:0%
you can take that
and put it into yours,

00:11:26.352 --> 00:11:28.621 align:start size:56% position:44% line:0%
then take part
of something else,

00:11:28.621 --> 00:11:31.223 align:start size:72% position:28%
<i> and it would
 significantly help you</i>

00:11:31.223 --> 00:11:34.926 align:start size:91% position:9%
<i> because it just builds
 your creativity off of them.</i>

00:11:34.926 --> 00:11:40.566 align:start size:97% position:3%
<i> (Motsinger)
 I walk in, and eyes don't turn
 to see who came in the door.</i>

00:11:40.566 --> 00:11:42.467 align:start position:0%
<i>They are focused,
they're engaged,</i>

00:11:42.467 --> 00:11:45.103 align:start size:97% position:3%
<i> they're talking to each other,
 they're communicating,</i>

00:11:45.103 --> 00:11:46.572 align:start position:0%
<i>they're collaborating.</i>

00:11:46.572 --> 00:11:51.610 align:start position:0%
<i>Three years ago, if I asked
a child what they wanted to be,</i>

00:11:51.610 --> 00:11:55.080 align:start position:0%
you'd hear "football player"
or "basketball player,"

00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:56.615 align:start position:0%
"a dancer."

00:11:56.615 --> 00:12:00.452 size:84% position:42%
Things that they relate to
and see in their community.

00:12:00.452 --> 00:12:04.289 align:start position:0%
Now we hear kids saying
they want to be engineers,

00:12:04.289 --> 00:12:08.794
or they want to be scientists
or want to work in forensics.

00:12:08.794 --> 00:12:11.797 align:start position:0%
This type of vocabulary
they didn't have before

00:12:11.797 --> 00:12:13.699
nor this type of inspiration.

00:12:13.699 --> 00:12:16.101 align:start position:0%
They didn't have
the knowledge before

00:12:16.101 --> 00:12:18.370 align:start position:0%
because they weren't
exposed to it.

00:12:19.772 --> 00:12:23.142 align:start position:0%
<i>Success to me means
that we've inspired a child</i>

00:12:23.142 --> 00:12:27.279 align:start position:0%
<i>who may not have known before
what they wanted to do.</i>

00:12:27.279 --> 00:12:31.050 align:start position:0% line:0%
<i>I feel successful
if a kid comes back excited</i>

00:12:31.050 --> 00:12:34.420 size:78% position:39% line:0%
<i>and wanting to learn more
about a specific topic</i>

00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:37.156
<i>or wanting to work on a project</i>

00:12:37.156 --> 00:12:40.959 align:start position:0%
<i>that before they saw as
just a task or assignment.</i>

00:12:40.959 --> 00:12:42.427 align:start position:0%
<i>When they're engaged,</i>

00:12:42.427 --> 00:12:44.730 align:start position:0%

about something,</i>

00:12:44.730 --> 00:12:47.032 align:start position:0%
