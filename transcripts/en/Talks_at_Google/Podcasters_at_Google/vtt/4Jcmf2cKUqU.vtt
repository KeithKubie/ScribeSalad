[APPLAUSE]

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:09.870
EMILY MATLACK:
Thank you, Carlos.

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:10.960
We really appreciate it.

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:13.660
And thank you all for
being here with us today.

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:14.510
I am Emily.

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:15.510
JASE LINDGREN: I'm Jase.

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:16.470
DEDEKER WINSTON: I'm Dedeker.

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:17.886
EMILY MATLACK: And
as you said, we

00:00:17.886 --> 00:00:19.830
are the hosts of the
Multiamory Podcast, which

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.860
is a weekly podcast that we've
been doing for about four years

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:24.330
now.

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.460
Today, we're here to talk
to you about the thing

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.490
that our podcast
continually comes back to,

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.180
and that is non-monogamy and
nontraditional relationships.

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.370
Since we've started
the podcast, we've

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.580
encountered every type of
question, of misunderstanding,

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:41.520
of stigma, that you could
possibly think about

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.420
and that you could possibly
think that would probably

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.100
come to people like us.

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.020
And really, that's
one of the reasons why

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.420
we started this podcast,
just because there are so

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.720
many misconceptions about what
polyamory and non-monogamy even

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:55.667
is.

00:00:55.667 --> 00:00:57.750
DEDEKER WINSTON: So the
name of this talk today is

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.460
"Non-Monogamy for Non-Majors,"
which is a little bit weird.

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.290
But we'll explain why.

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:05.099
So my main form
of work is I work

00:01:05.099 --> 00:01:06.750
as a certified
relationship coach.

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.480
I specialize in
working with people

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.511
who are connected to
non-monogamy in some way,

00:01:12.511 --> 00:01:14.760
whether it's people who are
trying to discover if it's

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.364
right for them, if
it's a couple who

00:01:16.364 --> 00:01:18.030
are trying to open
up their relationship

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.430
for the first time.

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:21.180
I work with people
kind of in a counseling

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.980
therapeutic capacity.

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:26.310
And so when I talk to
people about my work

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.980
or about my personal
life, I get a wide variety

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:32.700
of reactions, sometimes good,
sometimes bad, and sometimes

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.870
just really weird.

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:37.410
There was one time that I was
working with this photographer

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:39.660
on an unrelated job.

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:41.264
And this was two
or three years ago.

00:01:41.264 --> 00:01:43.680
I was in the middle of writing
the manuscript for my book.

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.170
And he starts asking
about the book,

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.680
and so I start describing
what it's about, polyamory,

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.710
and nontraditional sexuality,
and things like that.

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.210
All of a sudden, he cuts me off.

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.668
And he goes, oh,
I can't hear this.

00:01:55.668 --> 00:01:59.240
I can't hear this-- la, la,
la, la, la, la, la, la, la.

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.360
And so of course, I'm
like, well, that was weird.

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.450
And I asked him, like, why--

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.410
why can't you hear about this?

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:10.320
And I'll never forget
what he said to me.

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:18.430
He said, if I learn about
this, I can never unlearn it.

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.900
And that really struck me
because I was like, wow.

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.890
I realized he is
afraid that just

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.460
by hearing about the
concepts, somehow it's

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:34.389
going to get on him, and maybe
he's going to be converted

00:02:34.389 --> 00:02:34.930
or something.

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.940
It's like the non-monogamy toxic
waste is going to get on him

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.440
and turn him into this
radioactive monster.

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.120
And that sounds like a really
weird reaction, and it is.

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.240
But it's actually become
surprisingly common

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.240
for all three of us, whenever we
talk about the work that we do,

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:55.740
that people feel like by having
any contact with the subject

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:59.080
whatsoever, they're going to
turn into radioactive monsters

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:00.054
somehow.

00:03:00.054 --> 00:03:01.470
JASE LINDGREN: So
today, our talk,

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:05.370
"Non-Monogamy for the
Non-Major," or non-monster,

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:10.200
if you will, is because we're
here just to educate about what

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.510
this is, what it actually
looks like in real life--

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:16.230
not to proselytize to you, not
to tell you that any one way

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:20.010
of doing relationships is
better than any other way,

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.530
but simply to dispel
some of the myths.

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.770
And in doing that,
our hope is to make

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:30.000
this company, this community,
and our world a safer place

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.760
for all sorts of people.

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.400
Also, so we're going
to spend about half

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.380
the time doing a
presentation about that.

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:40.620
And then other half
is for questions.

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.600
We've had some that have
been submitted already

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.239
through the dory for this event.

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:46.530
You can also feel free to
furiously do those right now,

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:48.934
if you want to remain anonymous
in asking your questions.

00:03:48.934 --> 00:03:50.850
And then there's also
the microphone over here

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:52.910
for asking those later as well.

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:55.100
EMILY MATLACK: Yeah, but
before we do any of that,

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:57.600
we want to get into the why.

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.300
Why talk about
non-monogamy at all?

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:02.310
JASE LINDGREN: So when
we started this podcast

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:05.540
four years ago, my best friend
was talking to me about it.

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:07.390
And he was like,
so I don't get it.

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:09.570
Why do you need to
talk about stuff

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:10.920
that happens in the bedroom?

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:14.230
Can't you just keep that in the
bedroom like everybody else?

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:17.700
And it's essentially like asking
someone wearing a wedding ring,

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:21.000
really, do you have to flaunt
your sex in front of all of us?

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.120
Can't you just keep that in
the bedroom where it belongs?

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:25.620
EMILY MATLACK: And
really, the truth

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:29.160
is that all of these
relationship styles

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:32.880
really run the gamut from
casual to lifelong commitments.

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:35.520
And they are an integral
part of many people's lives,

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.740
just like anyone's
significant other

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:40.350
is a really vital part
of someone's life.

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:42.840
And it is important to
talk about non-monogamy

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:44.425
because it is prevalent.

00:04:44.425 --> 00:04:46.550
DEDEKER WINSTON: Yeah, it's
surprisingly prevalent.

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:50.640
So there was a study in 2016 in
the "Journal of Sex and Marital

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:56.310
Therapy" that found that within
the US, 20% of the population

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:58.920
has been involved in
some kind of consensually

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:01.530
open relationship at
some point in their life.

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:04.350
And the study defined a
consensually open relationship

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:06.990
as any relationship
where both partners

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:09.380
agree that they're
allowed to have

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:11.990
sexual or romantic
relationships outside

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:15.290
of that primary relationship.

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:18.170
20% boils down to about
one in five people,

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:20.477
which is quite a lot.

00:05:20.477 --> 00:05:23.060
JASE LINDGREN: And another study
in the "Journal of Psychology

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:26.360
and Sexuality" suggests that
between 4% and 5% of Americans

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:29.900
are currently in some kind of
non-monogamous relationship.

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:33.524
So that's about 16 million
people, just in the US.

00:05:33.524 --> 00:05:35.690
EMILY MATLACK: And just to
put that in perspective--

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:38.640
because that doesn't sound
like, maybe, that many people--

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:41.660
but 6% of the American
population is vegan.

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:42.810
I'm vegan.

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:45.720
Thank you Google for
giving me vegan food today.

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:47.030
I really appreciate it.

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:50.210
I'm also polyamorous,
so I'm extra special.

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:52.310
But probably most
of you know someone

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:54.090
who identifies as vegan.

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:56.999
And it doesn't really
seem that rare, does it?

00:05:56.999 --> 00:05:59.540
DEDEKER WINSTON: So the thing
is that in the work that we do,

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:03.350
we've come across people
in all lines of work,

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:08.306
from all walks of life, who
identify as non-monogamous.

00:06:08.306 --> 00:06:09.680
The people who
are non-monogamous

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:12.530
and polyamorous-- it's not just
your burlesque dancer cousin

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:14.450
who goes to Burning
Man every year.

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:15.920
It's everyone.

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:17.270
It's your Uber driver.

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:18.950
It's your kid's teacher.

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:20.030
It's your therapist.

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:20.900
It's your lawyer.

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:22.220
It's your doctor.

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:25.459
It's all kinds, all walks
of life, like I said.

00:06:25.459 --> 00:06:27.000
Maybe the person
sitting next to you.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.900
Again, 20%, even
5%, that's still

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:31.654
a huge chunk of the population.

00:06:31.654 --> 00:06:33.320
JASE LINDGREN: And
yet, despite the fact

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:36.980
that this is so prevalent,
there is a fundamental lack

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:41.360
of education and awareness about
non-monogamy, which as we've

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:45.140
seen with other sorts of fringe
groups or marginalized groups,

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:47.649
that this leads to fear.

00:06:47.649 --> 00:06:49.940
EMILY MATLACK: And there are
a lot of different reasons

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:53.360
why someone might be
fearful of non-monogamy.

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:56.840
For example, a person who is
quite happy being monogamous,

00:06:56.840 --> 00:07:00.130
they may learn about
monogamy, or may

00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:03.140
be worried that their partner
will learn about non-monogamy,

00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:06.080
and then suddenly want to change
their relationship structure.

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:08.720
Or like the photographer
that Dedeker talked about,

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:12.020
if they themselves learn about
non-monogamy, all of a sudden,

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:14.600
maybe, they're going to want
to become non-monogamous

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:16.110
themselves.

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:18.800
JASE LINDGREN: For other people,
it brings up unresolved issues

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:20.600
around infidelity in the past.

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:23.810
Maybe it brings up hurtful
memories of being cheated on

00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:26.320
or guilt of having
cheated on somebody else.

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:28.820
DEDEKER WINSTON: And the other
part of this fearful response

00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:31.040
is often, it's just a
product of growing up

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:33.590
in an extremely
sex-negative culture,

00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:35.520
like American culture is.

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:38.510
And it's this ingrained sex
negativity that teaches us

00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:40.970
that any kind of
sex, or any kind

00:07:40.970 --> 00:07:43.700
of romance, that doesn't
happen within the context

00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:45.830
of a heterosexual
marriage that's

00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:47.660
for the purpose of procreation--

00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:49.460
we treat all that
kind of sex that

00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:52.400
falls outside of that
bubble as being wrong,

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:54.500
as being dangerous,
as being dirty,

00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:56.510
as being something that
we should be afraid of

00:07:56.510 --> 00:07:59.580
and that we should
shun and try to avoid.

00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:05.270
So the thing is that this fear
leads to a whole cornucopia

00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:07.220
of misunderstandings.

00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:08.630
JASE LINDGREN: Yes.

00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:11.960
So when people talk about their
non-monogamous relationships,

00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:14.600
they come up against all
sorts of misunderstandings

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:16.910
and misconceptions
about what it is.

00:08:16.910 --> 00:08:18.470
And they can range
from the somewhat

00:08:18.470 --> 00:08:21.660
aggressive, like, oh--
or accusatory-- of oh,

00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:23.540
does that mean
you're a sex addict?

00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:27.080
Or isn't this just a
different form of cheating?

00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:31.470
Or to even seemingly
good natured pitying of,

00:08:31.470 --> 00:08:32.419
oh, that's awful.

00:08:32.419 --> 00:08:34.250
Is your husband
making you do that?

00:08:34.250 --> 00:08:39.039
Or well, I hope someday you find
someone who actually loves you.

00:08:39.039 --> 00:08:41.330
DEDEKER WINSTON: It's rough.

00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:46.130
JASE LINDGREN: And this
fear and misunderstanding

00:08:46.130 --> 00:08:48.372
combined with each other
is what creates stigma.

00:08:48.372 --> 00:08:50.330
DEDEKER WINSTON: So there
was a study performed

00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:52.160
at the University of
Michigan specifically

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:55.610
on trying to figure
out how stigma affects

00:08:55.610 --> 00:08:57.350
non-monogamous
relationships, or people

00:08:57.350 --> 00:08:59.490
in non-monogamous relationships.

00:08:59.490 --> 00:09:01.970
And so the interesting thing
is they found in this study

00:09:01.970 --> 00:09:04.820
that generally,
non-monogamous and polyamorous

00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:07.160
relationships are
perceived negatively

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:09.000
by the general population.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:10.730
But it's not just
that they're perceived

00:09:10.730 --> 00:09:14.240
to be less moral, or less
ethical, or less committed,

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:18.110
or less romantic, this
negative perception bled

00:09:18.110 --> 00:09:21.565
into other completely
arbitrary areas of life.

00:09:21.565 --> 00:09:22.940
EMILY MATLACK:
Yeah, for example,

00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:24.860
the participants in
the study thought

00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:26.960
that people who
were non-monogamous

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:30.080
were less likely to take a
daily multi-vitamin than people

00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:31.550
who are monogamous.

00:09:31.550 --> 00:09:32.675
DEDEKER WINSTON: It's true.

00:09:32.675 --> 00:09:34.216
JASE LINDGREN: They
also thought they

00:09:34.216 --> 00:09:36.410
were less likely to floss
their teeth every day,

00:09:36.410 --> 00:09:39.784
walk their dog every day, or
get their taxes filed on time.

00:09:39.784 --> 00:09:40.700
DEDEKER WINSTON: Yeah.

00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:42.241
And so that sounds
ridiculous, right?

00:09:42.241 --> 00:09:45.800
But the thing is that
perception still has an impact.

00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:48.230
Because the thing is that the
fear, the misunderstanding,

00:09:48.230 --> 00:09:49.160
the stigma--

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:50.610
these things all compound.

00:09:50.610 --> 00:09:51.860
They add on top of each other.

00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:55.290
And they add up to real
world consequences.

00:09:55.290 --> 00:09:57.536
So it's funny to
think about the fact

00:09:57.536 --> 00:09:58.910
that you might
perceive someone's

00:09:58.910 --> 00:10:00.880
less likely to take
a multi-vitamin,

00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:02.360
or less likely to
walk their dog,

00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:04.400
or floss their
teeth-- that's funny.

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:07.040
But if we're living
in a world where

00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:09.120
stigma towards
non-traditional relationships

00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:11.940
is so deeply ingrained that
we think that it affects

00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:14.820
whether or not someone can
get their taxes done on time,

00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:16.610
how comfortable
is your accountant

00:10:16.610 --> 00:10:19.020
going to be to talk about
her own non-monogamous

00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:20.580
relationship?

00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:23.147
These things result
in actual impact.

00:10:23.147 --> 00:10:24.730
JASE LINDGREN: And
it's not only that,

00:10:24.730 --> 00:10:29.130
but this bleeds over into other
things such as child custody.

00:10:29.130 --> 00:10:31.260
This is something that
tends to come up a lot.

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:33.780
There's not a lot of
formal statistics on it

00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:37.710
because most of these cases
are settled out of court.

00:10:37.710 --> 00:10:41.220
But non-monogamy, or polyamory,
can be used against people

00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:43.950
in custody battles,
often by family members,

00:10:43.950 --> 00:10:47.230
like their own parents trying to
take their kids away from them,

00:10:47.230 --> 00:10:50.464
and that judges,
without this knowledge,

00:10:50.464 --> 00:10:52.380
and having that stigma
in their heads of well,

00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:54.004
they're less likely
to walk their dogs,

00:10:54.004 --> 00:10:55.454
they have no moral fabric--

00:10:55.454 --> 00:10:57.120
yeah, they're probably
not a good person

00:10:57.120 --> 00:10:59.170
to raise a child either.

00:10:59.170 --> 00:11:01.800
EMILY MATLACK: And there's also
zero workplace protections.

00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:04.200
If your boss finds out
you're non-monogamous,

00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:07.400
there's no legal ramifications
for them firing you.

00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:10.470
And also, it's very
difficult for us

00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:13.380
to access things like
poly-friendly counseling,

00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:16.444
poly-friendly therapists,
legal services.

00:11:16.444 --> 00:11:18.360
And it also makes it
more difficult for things

00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:20.320
like adoption or
parenting rights.

00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:22.320
DEDEKER WINSTON: Yeah,
especially in those child

00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:24.466
custody cases,
finding a lawyer who

00:11:24.466 --> 00:11:26.340
understands the situation
of the parents, who

00:11:26.340 --> 00:11:28.620
maybe is an open marriage.

00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:30.720
On the coast, like
maybe in California--

00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:31.600
a little bit easier.

00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:33.976
But not so much in the
middle of the country.

00:11:33.976 --> 00:11:35.350
And the thing is
that, of course,

00:11:35.350 --> 00:11:38.430
with all of these real
world consequences,

00:11:38.430 --> 00:11:42.490
these get amplified, depending
on intersection of identity.

00:11:42.490 --> 00:11:45.090
So for instance, someone
who is married or unmarried,

00:11:45.090 --> 00:11:46.500
someone who's
uneducated, someone

00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:48.490
who is poor, someone who
is a person of color,

00:11:48.490 --> 00:11:51.780
who is already dealing with
real world consequences

00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:54.300
from stigma, adding
these on top of it

00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:57.905
just adds more to that
complexity and that difficulty.

00:11:57.905 --> 00:11:59.280
JASE LINDGREN: So
now we're going

00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:02.427
to move on to talk about
some myths versus reality.

00:12:02.427 --> 00:12:05.010
DEDEKER WINSTON: So that's the
thing is that toxic combination

00:12:05.010 --> 00:12:07.093
that we saw-- the fear,
plus the misunderstanding,

00:12:07.093 --> 00:12:08.280
plus the stigma--

00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:11.910
we've already seen how that
toxic combination affects

00:12:11.910 --> 00:12:14.050
other marginalized communities.

00:12:14.050 --> 00:12:17.110
We've seen how that affects
the trans community,

00:12:17.110 --> 00:12:20.320
the gay community,
immigrants, things like that.

00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:21.960
And so what we
found, the best way

00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:24.780
to combat that toxic
cocktail, as it were,

00:12:24.780 --> 00:12:28.870
is through awareness, through
education, through information.

00:12:28.870 --> 00:12:32.070
So before we dive
into specific actions

00:12:32.070 --> 00:12:34.740
that we can all take to help
combat some of these things

00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:36.990
and help make our
environment safer for people

00:12:36.990 --> 00:12:38.910
in nontraditional
relationships, we're

00:12:38.910 --> 00:12:42.360
going to try to tackle the
most common misconceptions.

00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:45.470
That's where we're tackling
some myths versus reality.

00:12:45.470 --> 00:12:48.009
JASE LINDGREN: So the first
one is that it's all about sex.

00:12:48.009 --> 00:12:49.550
Like I said, the
question of oh, does

00:12:49.550 --> 00:12:50.910
that mean you're a sex addict?

00:12:50.910 --> 00:12:52.742
Or well, it's unsafe.

00:12:52.742 --> 00:12:55.200
You're going to have sex in
front of children or something.

00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:57.806
That's why we need to
take them away from you.

00:12:57.806 --> 00:13:00.120
The why talk about this,
if it's just something

00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:01.800
that happens in the bedroom?

00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:05.520
And this has become also so
prevalent because of the way

00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:08.760
the media likes to talk about
it because it excites us.

00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:10.300
We see this picture.

00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:14.730
This is the iconic picture
of a polyamorous, or open,

00:13:14.730 --> 00:13:15.880
relationship.

00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:19.170
It seems to imply that
we're all naked, or at least

00:13:19.170 --> 00:13:21.633
bare-footed in bed all the time.

00:13:21.633 --> 00:13:23.244
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:23.244 --> 00:13:25.410
DEDEKER WINSTON: But
seriously, every single article

00:13:25.410 --> 00:13:28.475
about non-monogamy, you'll
find that stock image.

00:13:28.475 --> 00:13:30.000
It's always the feet.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:30.877
JASE LINDGREN: Yeah.

00:13:30.877 --> 00:13:32.460
EMILY MATLACK: But
in reality, there's

00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:34.650
actually a variety
of motivations

00:13:34.650 --> 00:13:38.100
why someone would want to be in
a non-monogamous relationship.

00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:40.530
And obviously, there's
no doubt that sex

00:13:40.530 --> 00:13:43.500
can be a really important
part of a relationship.

00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:46.260
But honestly, just any
type of romance, sex

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:49.120
may or may not be included
in that relationship.

00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:51.240
And there are many
asexual people

00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:54.300
who identify as
polyamorous, and sex may not

00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:56.790
be a part of the
equation for them at all.

00:13:56.790 --> 00:13:59.370
And also, just like
monogamous people,

00:13:59.370 --> 00:14:01.740
individual preferences
and amount of sex

00:14:01.740 --> 00:14:04.170
can vary from person to
person and relationship

00:14:04.170 --> 00:14:05.105
to relationship.

00:14:05.105 --> 00:14:06.480
DEDEKER WINSTON:
So the next myth

00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:08.070
that we're going to
tackle is the myth

00:14:08.070 --> 00:14:11.450
that non-monogamous
relationships are unethical,

00:14:11.450 --> 00:14:13.930
or that they are coercive.

00:14:13.930 --> 00:14:16.170
So we do need to tackle
the question of ethics.

00:14:16.170 --> 00:14:19.350
Because what often happens
is we get questions like,

00:14:19.350 --> 00:14:21.720
well, isn't that just
cheating on your partner?

00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:24.360
Aren't you just giving your
partner a hall pass to cheat on

00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:25.260
you?

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:29.130
And it makes sense why
the comparison gets drawn,

00:14:29.130 --> 00:14:31.710
because I think in
our media for so long,

00:14:31.710 --> 00:14:33.900
our only model of
non-monogamy that we've

00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:37.050
seen for a long time
has been cheating,

00:14:37.050 --> 00:14:40.860
or non-consensual, or
non ethical non-monogamy.

00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:43.110
And so it makes sense that
we draw that parallel.

00:14:43.110 --> 00:14:45.630
However, it's important to
bear in mind that cheating

00:14:45.630 --> 00:14:47.460
is based in dishonesty.

00:14:47.460 --> 00:14:49.180
It's based in
lying to a partner.

00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:50.760
And so that means
that even people

00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:52.770
who are polyamorous,
or non-monogamous,

00:14:52.770 --> 00:14:55.096
can still cheat
on their partner,

00:14:55.096 --> 00:14:56.970
if they lie about it,
if they omit something,

00:14:56.970 --> 00:14:58.021
if they cover it up.

00:14:58.021 --> 00:14:59.270
I don't know why people do it.

00:14:59.270 --> 00:15:00.520
It's part of why I have a job.

00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:05.010
And then about the
coercive part--

00:15:05.010 --> 00:15:08.250
there's often this assumption
that surely, one person must be

00:15:08.250 --> 00:15:09.900
forcing the other to do this.

00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:12.300
And usually, the assumption
is that the man--

00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:13.860
if it's a heterosexual
relationship,

00:15:13.860 --> 00:15:16.421
the assumption is that the
man must be forcing the woman

00:15:16.421 --> 00:15:16.920
to do this.

00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:19.410
Because no woman would
want this, and every man

00:15:19.410 --> 00:15:20.395
must want this.

00:15:20.395 --> 00:15:21.270
JASE LINDGREN: Right.

00:15:21.270 --> 00:15:25.650
And in reality, polyamorous
and non-monogamous people

00:15:25.650 --> 00:15:28.720
have ethical codes
just like anybody else.

00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:30.870
In fact, sometimes are
even more conscious

00:15:30.870 --> 00:15:33.450
about creating those
ethical codes--

00:15:33.450 --> 00:15:38.340
things like not being
competitive in a negative way,

00:15:38.340 --> 00:15:40.110
intentionally
fostering compassion

00:15:40.110 --> 00:15:43.140
for each other, and then
honest communication, which

00:15:43.140 --> 00:15:45.420
is a huge part of polyamory.

00:15:45.420 --> 00:15:48.180
If you ever read
any books or listen

00:15:48.180 --> 00:15:51.300
to any podcasts on the
subject, honest communication

00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:54.264
is a topic that comes
up over and over again.

00:15:54.264 --> 00:15:55.680
And in the same
way that you don't

00:15:55.680 --> 00:15:59.490
need a religious upbringing
to have morals and ethics,

00:15:59.490 --> 00:16:01.740
you also don't need to have
a monogamous relationship

00:16:01.740 --> 00:16:04.570
to treat that ethically as well.

00:16:04.570 --> 00:16:07.384
And then the subject of
coercion-- this one is actually

00:16:07.384 --> 00:16:09.300
interesting, so it
surprises a lot of people--

00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:13.350
and that's that statistically,
in heterosexual couples,

00:16:13.350 --> 00:16:16.110
women are actually more likely
to be the ones who suggest

00:16:16.110 --> 00:16:18.660
an open relationship, or a
non-monogamous relationship,

00:16:18.660 --> 00:16:20.460
than men are.

00:16:20.460 --> 00:16:21.960
EMILY MATLACK: So
for our next myth,

00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:24.720
we are going to tackle
the thought that everybody

00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:28.120
is in a group relationship,
or in a triad.

00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:31.050
So the media has this
very typical image

00:16:31.050 --> 00:16:33.679
of what a polyamorous
relationship looks like.

00:16:33.679 --> 00:16:35.720
And honestly, you've
probably all seen it before.

00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:39.630
It's this idea that there is
a white male, female, female

00:16:39.630 --> 00:16:41.259
triad.

00:16:41.259 --> 00:16:43.050
The media likes to call
it a thruple, which

00:16:43.050 --> 00:16:44.400
is not a real word.

00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:47.080
We don't actually use
that for polyamorous.

00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:50.490
But it usually consists of two
bisexual females and a man who

00:16:50.490 --> 00:16:54.240
live together, and they make all
of their relationship decisions

00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:56.340
together as a unit.

00:16:56.340 --> 00:16:59.850
Like this image of
the show "You Me Her."

00:16:59.850 --> 00:17:04.200
This is a show that is all
about a polyamorous triad.

00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:06.119
But again, it's
like a perfect image

00:17:06.119 --> 00:17:07.980
of what the media
likes to perpetuate,

00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:11.250
which is, again, this
bisexual female, these two

00:17:11.250 --> 00:17:13.750
bisexual females, with a man.

00:17:13.750 --> 00:17:16.890
And so this is just
prevalent because the image

00:17:16.890 --> 00:17:18.450
is so overused.

00:17:18.450 --> 00:17:20.945
It's almost become a
stereotype at this point.

00:17:20.945 --> 00:17:23.069
DEDEKER WINSTON: And we
suspect that the reason why

00:17:23.069 --> 00:17:26.790
media outlets always try to find
this particular relationship

00:17:26.790 --> 00:17:29.130
format of two women and
a man living together

00:17:29.130 --> 00:17:30.600
and all in a
relationship together

00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:34.380
is if you think about it, it's
kind of the least threatening

00:17:34.380 --> 00:17:36.090
version of non-monogamy.

00:17:36.090 --> 00:17:38.460
We're already quite
used to seeing the image

00:17:38.460 --> 00:17:40.022
of a man with multiple women.

00:17:40.022 --> 00:17:41.730
And we're more
comfortable digesting that

00:17:41.730 --> 00:17:44.010
than seeing a woman
with multiple men,

00:17:44.010 --> 00:17:45.840
on top of the fact
that we're quite used

00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:48.690
to seeing bisexual women,
especially for male pleasure,

00:17:48.690 --> 00:17:51.690
more so than seeing bisexual
men involved with a woman.

00:17:51.690 --> 00:17:53.460
And so it makes sense
why the media always

00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:56.310
tries to find this
particular grouping.

00:17:56.310 --> 00:17:58.590
But it gives this
incorrect perception

00:17:58.590 --> 00:18:00.260
that that's all
that polyamory is,

00:18:00.260 --> 00:18:03.570
is that everyone's in this
weird, communal, cult-like

00:18:03.570 --> 00:18:05.515
group relationship together.

00:18:05.515 --> 00:18:06.890
Because the reality
is that there

00:18:06.890 --> 00:18:08.970
is this huge
diversity of formats.

00:18:08.970 --> 00:18:12.600
Different motivations and needs
breed very different shapes

00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:13.860
in relationships.

00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:15.520
People use very
different labels.

00:18:15.520 --> 00:18:17.640
Sometimes people call
it an open relationship.

00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:19.920
Sometimes people call
themselves polyamorous,

00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:21.572
or relationship
anarchists, which

00:18:21.572 --> 00:18:24.030
is a whole other term that we
could do a whole presentation

00:18:24.030 --> 00:18:24.529
on.

00:18:24.529 --> 00:18:26.520
But unfortunately, not today.

00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:29.430
For the most part, in
reality, what we see--

00:18:29.430 --> 00:18:31.740
rather than a bunch
of triads, or a bunch

00:18:31.740 --> 00:18:35.190
of four-person relationships, or
group relationships-- usually,

00:18:35.190 --> 00:18:37.490
we're seeing
interconnecting dyads, so as

00:18:37.490 --> 00:18:39.840
in two-person
relationships, where

00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:43.230
maybe both people in that dyad
also have another partner,

00:18:43.230 --> 00:18:45.310
but those partners are
not related to each other,

00:18:45.310 --> 00:18:47.550
and maybe those partners
also have other partners.

00:18:47.550 --> 00:18:49.550
So what we see in
real life is usually

00:18:49.550 --> 00:18:52.950
these kind of
constellation-esque intimate

00:18:52.950 --> 00:18:55.730
networks that sometimes
move, and shift, and change

00:18:55.730 --> 00:18:56.790
over time.

00:18:56.790 --> 00:18:58.590
And it makes sense
because the same way

00:18:58.590 --> 00:19:00.290
with monogamous
relationships, the way

00:19:00.290 --> 00:19:02.040
that you create your
relationship is going

00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:04.830
to be different, based
on what your context is,

00:19:04.830 --> 00:19:07.140
based on if you want
to get married, if you

00:19:07.140 --> 00:19:08.280
don't want to get married.

00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:09.540
Maybe you don't
want to get married,

00:19:09.540 --> 00:19:12.000
but one of your partners
really needs health insurance.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.670
Or if you're choosing
to raise kids together,

00:19:14.670 --> 00:19:17.250
or if you're choosing
to not cohabit

00:19:17.250 --> 00:19:19.620
with someone who is your life
partner, or multiple life

00:19:19.620 --> 00:19:21.270
partners, or things like that.

00:19:21.270 --> 00:19:24.210
Ultimately, the takeaway is
that although the media would

00:19:24.210 --> 00:19:25.920
have us believe
that it all looks

00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:29.110
like this particular shape,
it doesn't all look the same.

00:19:29.110 --> 00:19:31.110
JASE LINDGREN: So the
next myth is that it's not

00:19:31.110 --> 00:19:32.310
a real relationship.

00:19:32.310 --> 00:19:33.810
It's the idea that
oh, well, someday

00:19:33.810 --> 00:19:36.080
you'll find someone who
actually loves you enough.

00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:38.970
Or oh, I understand
you're young.

00:19:38.970 --> 00:19:40.590
Eventually you'll
grow out of this,

00:19:40.590 --> 00:19:42.660
and then you'll have
a real relationship.

00:19:42.660 --> 00:19:45.600
And I think a lot of this
is because for most people,

00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:49.560
casual dating is the closest
analogy that they have.

00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:51.850
It's the closest thing
that they understand

00:19:51.850 --> 00:19:54.690
that looks sort of like
this, the key difference

00:19:54.690 --> 00:19:57.490
being that casual dating
doesn't have commitments

00:19:57.490 --> 00:19:59.490
and generally, you're not
ever talking to anyone

00:19:59.490 --> 00:20:02.240
you're dating about anyone
else that you're dating.

00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:04.890
It's this kind of let's
pretend it's not existing

00:20:04.890 --> 00:20:07.452
until we get serious and then
we stop seeing anyone else.

00:20:07.452 --> 00:20:08.910
DEDEKER WINSTON:
And the reality is

00:20:08.910 --> 00:20:12.810
that actually, people
who are not monogamous

00:20:12.810 --> 00:20:16.200
have comparable relationship
satisfaction and experiences

00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:18.394
to people who are in
monogamous relationships.

00:20:18.394 --> 00:20:20.310
So that same study that
we told you about that

00:20:20.310 --> 00:20:22.620
found the stigma about
flossing your teeth

00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:24.330
and walking your dog--

00:20:24.330 --> 00:20:27.870
that study also found that
there is virtually no difference

00:20:27.870 --> 00:20:29.820
in relationship functioning
and relationship

00:20:29.820 --> 00:20:32.550
success between people who are
non-monogamous and people who

00:20:32.550 --> 00:20:33.750
are monogamous.

00:20:33.750 --> 00:20:35.590
They also found that
specifically people who

00:20:35.590 --> 00:20:38.850
identified as polyamorous--
as in having multiple romantic

00:20:38.850 --> 00:20:40.950
relationships at the same time--

00:20:40.950 --> 00:20:43.230
they were found to
experience even higher levels

00:20:43.230 --> 00:20:45.750
of satisfaction, of
commitment, of trust,

00:20:45.750 --> 00:20:48.790
and of passionate love
in their relationships.

00:20:48.790 --> 00:20:51.030
So these myths that we're
talking about today,

00:20:51.030 --> 00:20:54.240
and these misconceptions--
obviously, it's not everything.

00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:55.890
It's not every
single misconception.

00:20:55.890 --> 00:21:00.330
We would be here all night if
we dove into every single one.

00:21:00.330 --> 00:21:02.250
But what we want
to move on towards

00:21:02.250 --> 00:21:04.980
is talking about the
things that we can all

00:21:04.980 --> 00:21:08.110
do to help combat
some of these things,

00:21:08.110 --> 00:21:10.470
and again, just to make
the environment safer.

00:21:10.470 --> 00:21:12.810
And they're very,
very simple things

00:21:12.810 --> 00:21:16.109
that everyone can
do-- very achievable.

00:21:16.109 --> 00:21:17.400
JASE LINDGREN: Yeah, go for it.

00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:18.191
EMILY MATLACK: Yes.

00:21:18.191 --> 00:21:22.620
If you don't practice or
identify with non-monogamy,

00:21:22.620 --> 00:21:25.200
then somebody comes
to you and tells you

00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:27.180
that they're opening
the relationship up,

00:21:27.180 --> 00:21:30.160
the first thing that you
can do is don't freak out.

00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:33.030
So if a friend tells you
that they're polyamorous,

00:21:33.030 --> 00:21:35.220
they're most likely
not coming on to you.

00:21:35.220 --> 00:21:37.560
They're not trying to
steal their husband.

00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:40.140
It probably has nothing
to do with you at all.

00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:41.490
So don't freak out.

00:21:41.490 --> 00:21:44.547
Play it cool, man.

00:21:44.547 --> 00:21:46.880
JASE LINDGREN: The next one
is to ask before you assume.

00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:48.520
And this means a
number of things.

00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:51.690
The first thing is it means
ask before you assume it's

00:21:51.690 --> 00:21:52.960
OK to ask a lot of questions.

00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:54.960
I know it's weird to ask
a question about asking

00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:55.980
questions.

00:21:55.980 --> 00:21:58.200
But just because someone
has opened up to you

00:21:58.200 --> 00:22:00.690
that they have multiple
romantic relationships

00:22:00.690 --> 00:22:03.480
doesn't mean they want to answer
every single detailed question

00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:07.140
that you have right now about
it, or at least maybe not right

00:22:07.140 --> 00:22:07.780
now at work.

00:22:07.780 --> 00:22:09.780
Maybe they want to talk
about that another time.

00:22:09.780 --> 00:22:12.020
Let's go out for drinks
sometime and you can ask it.

00:22:12.020 --> 00:22:14.430
So just ask before you
launch into those questions.

00:22:14.430 --> 00:22:17.250
And then the second
thing is to ask

00:22:17.250 --> 00:22:20.550
what are the labels, or the
terms, that they like to use,

00:22:20.550 --> 00:22:23.710
so that you can use the correct
ones when talking to them.

00:22:23.710 --> 00:22:26.460
For example, if I tell
someone that I'm polyamorous,

00:22:26.460 --> 00:22:29.340
and then they say, oh, this
my friend who's polygamous.

00:22:29.340 --> 00:22:30.390
I'm like, whoa.

00:22:30.390 --> 00:22:31.730
Those are not the same thing.

00:22:31.730 --> 00:22:33.480
Please don't use that
word to describe me.

00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:34.560
DEDEKER WINSTON: That
happens all the time

00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:36.150
that people interchange
those terms.

00:22:36.150 --> 00:22:37.530
JASE LINDGREN: Yeah,
but with anything else,

00:22:37.530 --> 00:22:39.196
someone might be in
an open relationship

00:22:39.196 --> 00:22:41.490
and not want to be
referred to as polyamorous,

00:22:41.490 --> 00:22:43.470
or they might prefer
that their partners are

00:22:43.470 --> 00:22:46.710
called life partners and not
boyfriends or girlfriends.

00:22:46.710 --> 00:22:48.516
Just ask those questions
of, how would you

00:22:48.516 --> 00:22:49.890
like me to refer
to this when I'm

00:22:49.890 --> 00:22:52.434
talking to you, or about
you with other people?

00:22:52.434 --> 00:22:54.600
DEDEKER WINSTON: And the
other important thing to do

00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:56.634
is to give acknowledgment.

00:22:56.634 --> 00:22:58.800
And that's going to look a
number of different ways.

00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:01.770
One way that you can do
this is to just ask someone

00:23:01.770 --> 00:23:03.540
about their other partners.

00:23:03.540 --> 00:23:06.510
Bear in mind that maybe the
partner that you've always seen

00:23:06.510 --> 00:23:08.490
come to work events,
or the partner

00:23:08.490 --> 00:23:11.640
that this person lives with
or is raising children with--

00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:13.200
it may not be
their only partner.

00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:16.170
It may not even be the most
important relationship to them.

00:23:16.170 --> 00:23:18.090
So just acknowledging
that this person may

00:23:18.090 --> 00:23:20.580
have more than one important
person in their life,

00:23:20.580 --> 00:23:23.040
even just by straight
up asking, like, oh,

00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:24.360
how's your wife doing?

00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:25.530
How's your girlfriend doing?

00:23:25.530 --> 00:23:29.957
How's your boyfriend
doing-- things like that.

00:23:29.957 --> 00:23:32.040
Most recently when I went
to visit some family out

00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:36.990
in Boise, my aunt, who has
been really resistant to this

00:23:36.990 --> 00:23:38.370
for a long time--

00:23:38.370 --> 00:23:40.680
for the first time
ever, she did this.

00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:43.620
She asked, how's Jase doing,
who is one of my partners,

00:23:43.620 --> 00:23:46.710
and also asked, how's Alex
doing-- my other partner.

00:23:46.710 --> 00:23:49.680
And it was so simple for
her to do, so, so simple.

00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:53.370
And it just made me feel so much
more relaxed, and so excited,

00:23:53.370 --> 00:23:55.500
and so validated, that
I got to just talk

00:23:55.500 --> 00:23:57.960
about the people in my
life that I love to someone

00:23:57.960 --> 00:23:59.610
else in my family whom I love.

00:23:59.610 --> 00:24:02.070
So again-- super,
super simple thing.

00:24:02.070 --> 00:24:05.439
And another trick to this
also, in asking questions--

00:24:05.439 --> 00:24:07.230
it's probably best to
avoid asking someone,

00:24:07.230 --> 00:24:09.190
well, how many
partners do you have?

00:24:09.190 --> 00:24:10.770
It's a very common question.

00:24:10.770 --> 00:24:13.650
And the problem is that people
define partners a little bit

00:24:13.650 --> 00:24:14.190
differently.

00:24:14.190 --> 00:24:16.523
Sometimes it gets a little
bit sticky in the definition.

00:24:16.523 --> 00:24:19.320
So it's better just to
ask, who are your partners?

00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:20.554
Who's important to you?

00:24:20.554 --> 00:24:22.470
Who are the people that
you love in your life,

00:24:22.470 --> 00:24:24.480
or who are the people
that are in your life

00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:27.314
that you feel like everyone
needs to know about?

00:24:27.314 --> 00:24:28.980
Another way that
acknowledgment can look

00:24:28.980 --> 00:24:30.497
is by extending an invite.

00:24:30.497 --> 00:24:32.580
And this means that if
you're having an event that

00:24:32.580 --> 00:24:35.799
has a plus one, maybe consider
offering them a plus two,

00:24:35.799 --> 00:24:38.340
so that somebody doesn't have
to choose between which partner

00:24:38.340 --> 00:24:39.510
they have to bring.

00:24:39.510 --> 00:24:41.640
If, for some reason,
your event's at capacity

00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:44.922
and you can't really have
more than a plus one,

00:24:44.922 --> 00:24:46.380
let the person that
you're inviting

00:24:46.380 --> 00:24:48.622
be the person who decides
who it is that they bring.

00:24:48.622 --> 00:24:50.580
It may not be the person
that you're expecting,

00:24:50.580 --> 00:24:51.339
and that's OK.

00:24:51.339 --> 00:24:52.630
EMILY MATLACK: Don't freak out.

00:24:52.630 --> 00:24:54.286
DEDEKER WINSTON:
And don't freak out.

00:24:54.286 --> 00:24:56.160
And another way that
acknowledgement can look

00:24:56.160 --> 00:24:58.510
is just to take it seriously.

00:24:58.510 --> 00:25:01.260
And this can mean things
like don't immediately

00:25:01.260 --> 00:25:03.530
tell this person like,
oh, this is just a phase.

00:25:03.530 --> 00:25:04.710
You're young.

00:25:04.710 --> 00:25:07.140
Oh, you know, you're going to
find your soul mate someday.

00:25:07.140 --> 00:25:08.760
It's going to be OK.

00:25:08.760 --> 00:25:10.430
Don't offer your pity.

00:25:10.430 --> 00:25:13.010
Don't offer to help them
out with walking their dog,

00:25:13.010 --> 00:25:16.040
or flossing their teeth,
or doing their taxes.

00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:18.900
They're probably going
to be OK with that.

00:25:18.900 --> 00:25:21.650
EMILY MATLACK: And lastly,
avoid therapy sessions.

00:25:21.650 --> 00:25:24.320
And what we mean by this
is if somebody comes

00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:27.000
to you who's non-monogamous
and starts talking

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:28.640
to you about maybe
issues that they

00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:30.440
have in their
relationship, don't

00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:32.200
try to be their therapist.

00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:34.850
Don't tell them like,
oh, well, clearly, it's

00:25:34.850 --> 00:25:37.440
your non-monogamy
that's the problem here.

00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:40.730
And then on the flip side,
don't make them the therapist.

00:25:40.730 --> 00:25:43.520
Don't tell them
about all of the sex

00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:45.950
that you've been having
with this other person,

00:25:45.950 --> 00:25:48.470
or talking about the
threesome that you

00:25:48.470 --> 00:25:50.300
had with your
husband six years ago

00:25:50.300 --> 00:25:52.490
and how difficult
it was for you.

00:25:52.490 --> 00:25:54.040
Don't make them your therapist.

00:25:54.040 --> 00:25:57.200
And also don't be
their therapist.

00:25:57.200 --> 00:25:59.630
JASE LINDGREN: So next is if
you do practice non-monogamy,

00:25:59.630 --> 00:26:02.750
or you identify
as non-monogamous,

00:26:02.750 --> 00:26:05.730
what can you do to help make
this world a safer place?

00:26:05.730 --> 00:26:07.450
And the first thing
is to come out.

00:26:07.450 --> 00:26:11.030
Now, this one-- a lot
of people go, hleh--

00:26:11.030 --> 00:26:13.350
and freaking out about that.

00:26:13.350 --> 00:26:17.270
And the thing is that with this,
just like with homosexuality,

00:26:17.270 --> 00:26:20.990
the more people come out and
the more people who are willing

00:26:20.990 --> 00:26:23.570
and feel safe enough to
speak about it publicly--

00:26:23.570 --> 00:26:26.060
if you're privileged to be in
a position where you are safe

00:26:26.060 --> 00:26:29.100
to do that with
minimal consequences--

00:26:29.100 --> 00:26:31.220
the more people that
do that, the safer it

00:26:31.220 --> 00:26:32.780
becomes for everybody.

00:26:32.780 --> 00:26:36.680
Because it's been shown in
several studies that simply

00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:39.480
knowing someone who is
in a marginalized group,

00:26:39.480 --> 00:26:43.460
whether it's gay, whether it's
trans, that simply knowing

00:26:43.460 --> 00:26:47.120
someone, or even knowing someone
who personally knows someone,

00:26:47.120 --> 00:26:49.520
makes you more likely
to vote favorably

00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:51.440
to protect that group.

00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:53.180
It makes you less
likely to discriminate

00:26:53.180 --> 00:26:54.175
against that group.

00:26:54.175 --> 00:26:56.300
DEDEKER WINSTON: So the
other thing that you can do

00:26:56.300 --> 00:26:58.310
is you can find support.

00:26:58.310 --> 00:26:59.487
Because we all get it.

00:26:59.487 --> 00:27:01.070
Any time you're
trying to do something

00:27:01.070 --> 00:27:03.380
that goes against the
grain of social norms,

00:27:03.380 --> 00:27:04.600
it can be very alienating.

00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:06.180
It can be very isolating.

00:27:06.180 --> 00:27:08.390
But the thing is that you
don't have to be alone.

00:27:08.390 --> 00:27:11.210
You can find support in the
form of meet-up or discussion

00:27:11.210 --> 00:27:11.750
groups.

00:27:11.750 --> 00:27:15.800
If you Google it, you will find
it, especially here in Seattle.

00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:17.880
There's plenty of meet-up
and discussion groups.

00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:20.880
I also recommend finding
professional support.

00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:23.720
So there is definitely a lack
of therapists, and counselors,

00:27:23.720 --> 00:27:26.240
and other professionals
who are friendly

00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:27.710
to non-monogamous lifestyles.

00:27:27.710 --> 00:27:29.543
But it doesn't mean
they don't exist at all.

00:27:29.543 --> 00:27:32.600
Fortunately, the
supply is slowly

00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:34.970
starting to catch up to
the demand that's there.

00:27:34.970 --> 00:27:37.220
There's a lot of great
resources in directories

00:27:37.220 --> 00:27:38.090
for finding this.

00:27:38.090 --> 00:27:40.579
There's the Kink Aware
Professionals Directory.

00:27:40.579 --> 00:27:42.620
There's the Poly-Friendly
Professionals Directory

00:27:42.620 --> 00:27:45.560
for finding people who are
either in your area or willing

00:27:45.560 --> 00:27:49.610
to work remotely
with you, who again--

00:27:49.610 --> 00:27:51.440
an actual therapy
session, are not

00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:54.380
going to immediately go to
your relationship choices

00:27:54.380 --> 00:27:56.510
as the source of your
problems, but treat things

00:27:56.510 --> 00:27:57.987
a little bit more holistically.

00:27:57.987 --> 00:27:59.570
And then another
thing that you can do

00:27:59.570 --> 00:28:01.340
is you can find community.

00:28:01.340 --> 00:28:02.990
And it doesn't have
to be necessarily

00:28:02.990 --> 00:28:06.050
a community that's
based on non-monogamy

00:28:06.050 --> 00:28:08.750
or based on a particular
relationship style.

00:28:08.750 --> 00:28:12.350
It could be a particularly
supportive work community,

00:28:12.350 --> 00:28:14.870
where you feel safe, you
feel like you can be out,

00:28:14.870 --> 00:28:16.906
you can talk about what's
going on in your life,

00:28:16.906 --> 00:28:19.280
you're not having to do the
mental gymnastics of figuring

00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:22.610
out who have I told what,
who has met which partner,

00:28:22.610 --> 00:28:25.145
who can never meet this other
partner-- things like that.

00:28:25.145 --> 00:28:27.020
EMILY MATLACK: The next
thing that you can do

00:28:27.020 --> 00:28:28.760
is be respectful.

00:28:28.760 --> 00:28:31.670
And what I mean by that is be
respectful of other people's

00:28:31.670 --> 00:28:33.320
relationship structures.

00:28:33.320 --> 00:28:36.650
So don't trash monogamy
if you are non-monogamous.

00:28:36.650 --> 00:28:39.080
You're not more enlightened
than anyone else is.

00:28:39.080 --> 00:28:41.590
We're all just trying
to figure it out.

00:28:41.590 --> 00:28:44.030
So be respectful and
be kind to something--

00:28:44.030 --> 00:28:47.630
a relationship structure
that's different than yours.

00:28:47.630 --> 00:28:50.690
DEDEKER WINSTON: So the
big takeaway here is just

00:28:50.690 --> 00:28:53.330
make it safe to be honest.

00:28:53.330 --> 00:28:56.210
Make yourself a person who
is safe for other people

00:28:56.210 --> 00:28:58.130
to be honest with you.

00:28:58.130 --> 00:29:00.620
And it's actually a
relatively simple thing to do.

00:29:00.620 --> 00:29:02.950
It just means if
someone opens up

00:29:02.950 --> 00:29:04.700
to you about their
relationship, and maybe

00:29:04.700 --> 00:29:07.100
that's something that you
would never do in your life

00:29:07.100 --> 00:29:10.580
and you have no interest
in whatsoever, that's fine.

00:29:10.580 --> 00:29:12.910
You just don't get to
say it to their face.

00:29:12.910 --> 00:29:14.300
You can save the big reactions.

00:29:14.300 --> 00:29:17.840
And it can also mean speaking
up if you hear someone else

00:29:17.840 --> 00:29:20.030
trashing on someone else
for their non-monogamous

00:29:20.030 --> 00:29:20.990
relationship.

00:29:20.990 --> 00:29:23.190
It's really relatively simple.

00:29:23.190 --> 00:29:26.220
And it starts on the individual
level to change a culture,

00:29:26.220 --> 00:29:28.910
whether it's a workplace
culture or the culture at large,

00:29:28.910 --> 00:29:30.950
of just making it safe
for people to be honest

00:29:30.950 --> 00:29:33.110
and to be their true selves.

00:29:33.110 --> 00:29:35.395
So right now, we're going
to move into questions.

00:29:35.395 --> 00:29:37.520
We have gotten a number of
questions that have been

00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:38.957
submitted through the dory.

00:29:38.957 --> 00:29:40.540
But before we dive
into that, if there

00:29:40.540 --> 00:29:44.650
is anyone who wants to
ask questions on the mic,

00:29:44.650 --> 00:29:47.306
we can definitely
go into that now.

00:29:47.306 --> 00:29:48.556
JASE LINDGREN: Yeah, go ahead.

00:29:48.556 --> 00:29:49.984
AUDIENCE: Hi, my name's Garrett.

00:29:49.984 --> 00:29:54.750
And I'm curious in hearing
more about the [INAUDIBLE]

00:29:54.750 --> 00:29:56.382
societies, especially
in this country.

00:29:56.382 --> 00:29:57.756
It seems like our
legal framework

00:29:57.756 --> 00:30:02.242
is set up for a relationship
with two people.

00:30:02.242 --> 00:30:03.950
In a polyamorous
relationship, how

00:30:03.950 --> 00:30:06.840
do you deal with
things like taxes

00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:10.382
having only single or married--

00:30:10.382 --> 00:30:11.615
and legal things like that?

00:30:11.615 --> 00:30:12.490
EMILY MATLACK: Right.

00:30:12.490 --> 00:30:13.660
Should I take this one?

00:30:13.660 --> 00:30:14.260
JASE LINDGREN: Yeah, go for it.

00:30:14.260 --> 00:30:15.110
DEDEKER WINSTON:
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:30:15.110 --> 00:30:16.735
It's a really
fascinating conversation.

00:30:16.735 --> 00:30:19.040
We've had a number of lawyers
on the podcast, lawyers

00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:22.400
who do specialize in family
law for people who are queer,

00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:26.270
or polyamorous, or in some kind
of nontraditional sexuality.

00:30:26.270 --> 00:30:30.710
And so it is an interesting
time because as opposed to what

00:30:30.710 --> 00:30:32.300
we saw with the gay
community, there's

00:30:32.300 --> 00:30:35.210
not a ton of people in the
polyamorous, or non-monogamous,

00:30:35.210 --> 00:30:36.620
community that
are really pushing

00:30:36.620 --> 00:30:39.080
for something like marriage
rights, for instance.

00:30:39.080 --> 00:30:42.380
There's not quite this
huge snowballing movement

00:30:42.380 --> 00:30:44.240
towards getting marriage rights.

00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:46.040
Because it would be
really complicated

00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:49.250
to try to figure
out how does it work

00:30:49.250 --> 00:30:51.170
signing a legal contract
with multiple people

00:30:51.170 --> 00:30:52.460
at the same time.

00:30:52.460 --> 00:30:55.250
Do you have overlapping
dyadic legal contracts--

00:30:55.250 --> 00:30:57.240
things like that.

00:30:57.240 --> 00:31:00.320
What I think, as far as the
legal side of things goes,

00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:02.090
is really going to
be the thing that

00:31:02.090 --> 00:31:04.700
is the talking point for
non-monogamous relationships--

00:31:04.700 --> 00:31:06.794
is more about child custody.

00:31:06.794 --> 00:31:08.960
And that's where we're
actually seeing some progress

00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:12.260
that there's already been
some precedents set of people

00:31:12.260 --> 00:31:14.840
granting parenting rights
to more than two parents,

00:31:14.840 --> 00:31:16.730
to three parents.

00:31:16.730 --> 00:31:18.900
We've had a couple of
precedents of that.

00:31:18.900 --> 00:31:19.980
The other thing is
that there's actually

00:31:19.980 --> 00:31:21.950
a lot of people in the
non-monogamous community

00:31:21.950 --> 00:31:23.960
that rather than pushing
for marriage rights,

00:31:23.960 --> 00:31:25.730
they're pushing
more for increasing

00:31:25.730 --> 00:31:27.800
the rights of single
people, so that we

00:31:27.800 --> 00:31:30.350
don't have this whole big
bundle of rights that are only

00:31:30.350 --> 00:31:32.515
reserved for one particular
relationship type,

00:31:32.515 --> 00:31:36.870
but instead making those rights
more accessible to everyone.

00:31:36.870 --> 00:31:38.480
So that's kind of
what we're seeing.

00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:40.950
As far as specifically
about marriage rights,

00:31:40.950 --> 00:31:44.420
I don't think we're going
to see that really take off

00:31:44.420 --> 00:31:46.310
any time soon
because of the fact

00:31:46.310 --> 00:31:49.970
that again, it's complicated,
and there's not a lot of people

00:31:49.970 --> 00:31:52.610
who specifically want marriage.

00:31:52.610 --> 00:31:55.284
EMILY MATLACK: But some people
do things like create LLCs--

00:31:55.284 --> 00:31:56.200
DEDEKER WINSTON: Yeah.

00:31:56.200 --> 00:31:59.930
EMILY MATLACK: Yeah-- in
order to combine assets.

00:31:59.930 --> 00:32:01.094
But other than that--

00:32:01.094 --> 00:32:02.510
DEDEKER WINSTON:
Especially people

00:32:02.510 --> 00:32:04.610
who want to raise a
child together and have

00:32:04.610 --> 00:32:06.860
that be protected.

00:32:06.860 --> 00:32:09.980
People are making Subchapter
S corporations for years,

00:32:09.980 --> 00:32:12.080
creating LLCs for
years-- just kind

00:32:12.080 --> 00:32:14.840
of using the legal
tools at their disposal

00:32:14.840 --> 00:32:17.034
to protect themselves in
the ways that they want to.

00:32:17.034 --> 00:32:18.950
JASE LINDGREN: Because
the truth of the matter

00:32:18.950 --> 00:32:21.690
is that marriage
is a legal tool.

00:32:21.690 --> 00:32:25.340
We've wrapped it up in this
whole romantic love thing.

00:32:25.340 --> 00:32:27.200
But at the end of the
day, it's a contract

00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:30.740
that you sign that the state
sanctions and gives you

00:32:30.740 --> 00:32:32.480
certain rights, and
responsibilities,

00:32:32.480 --> 00:32:34.530
and liabilities that go with it.

00:32:34.530 --> 00:32:37.400
So in thinking of it
that way, while there

00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:39.860
are many things you can't get
any other way than getting

00:32:39.860 --> 00:32:43.400
married, using the corporate
structure in our country

00:32:43.400 --> 00:32:46.572
is sort of the next best
thing that we can do.

00:32:46.572 --> 00:32:47.280
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:32:47.280 --> 00:32:47.960
JASE LINDGREN:
Thank you so much.

00:32:47.960 --> 00:32:49.410
EMILY MATLACK: Thank you.

00:32:49.410 --> 00:32:53.140
AUDIENCE: Since you see
[INAUDIBLE] maybe 20% of people

00:32:53.140 --> 00:33:01.970
who have [INAUDIBLE],,
do you ever find trouble

00:33:01.970 --> 00:33:05.210
finding other people
who feel the same way?

00:33:05.210 --> 00:33:06.231
EMILY MATLACK: Do we--

00:33:06.231 --> 00:33:07.772
JASE LINDGREN: Find
trouble meeting--

00:33:07.772 --> 00:33:09.470
EMILY MATLACK: Meeting
other non-monogamous people?

00:33:09.470 --> 00:33:10.370
DEDEKER WINSTON: Right, right.

00:33:10.370 --> 00:33:11.161
EMILY MATLACK: Yes.

00:33:11.161 --> 00:33:12.500
DEDEKER WINSTON: Well, yes.

00:33:12.500 --> 00:33:14.780
The thing to bear in mind
is that the internet really

00:33:14.780 --> 00:33:18.420
revolutionized that
for a lot of people.

00:33:18.420 --> 00:33:20.540
Definitely in the
'90s is when we

00:33:20.540 --> 00:33:22.340
started seeing an
actual resurgence

00:33:22.340 --> 00:33:25.130
of actual communities
coming together

00:33:25.130 --> 00:33:27.590
of people who identified as
polyamorous, or not monogamous,

00:33:27.590 --> 00:33:30.350
because people could find
each other for the first time

00:33:30.350 --> 00:33:31.620
in a long time.

00:33:31.620 --> 00:33:34.610
And so it depends,
based on location.

00:33:34.610 --> 00:33:37.460
The West Coast tends
to have pretty robust

00:33:37.460 --> 00:33:38.780
non-monogamous communities.

00:33:38.780 --> 00:33:43.040
And so people have a relatively
easy-ish time finding partners

00:33:43.040 --> 00:33:44.550
to date, or friends,
or communities,

00:33:44.550 --> 00:33:45.383
or things like that.

00:33:45.383 --> 00:33:48.720
Of course, definitely a
lot harder in the Midwest,

00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:50.600
in middle America, for sure.

00:33:50.600 --> 00:33:53.480
But there's also a lot of
online communities springing

00:33:53.480 --> 00:33:56.042
up as well for people to
connect to each other.

00:33:56.042 --> 00:33:57.500
And again, this is
kind of thing is

00:33:57.500 --> 00:34:00.710
that like I say, 20% of
the population-- it's huge.

00:34:00.710 --> 00:34:01.694
And if we can have--

00:34:01.694 --> 00:34:03.110
are there vegan-only
dating sites?

00:34:03.110 --> 00:34:03.630
There must be.

00:34:03.630 --> 00:34:04.580
EMILY MATLACK: Oh,
yeah, I'm sure.

00:34:04.580 --> 00:34:05.050
Definitely.

00:34:05.050 --> 00:34:06.545
DEDEKER WINSTON: If we can
have vegan-only dating sites--

00:34:06.545 --> 00:34:08.150
EMILY MATLACK: It's a
hard line for some people.

00:34:08.150 --> 00:34:10.483
DEDEKER WINSTON: --and vegans
can find each other today,

00:34:10.483 --> 00:34:13.614
non-monogamous people can
find each other today as well.

00:34:13.614 --> 00:34:14.780
Thank you for your question.

00:34:14.780 --> 00:34:16.227
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:34:16.227 --> 00:34:18.560
JASE LINDGREN: And we have
some questions from the dory,

00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:19.296
I believe.

00:34:19.296 --> 00:34:19.879
AUDIENCE: Yep.

00:34:19.879 --> 00:34:20.760
[INAUDIBLE]

00:34:20.760 --> 00:34:23.960
So the first one is, what
are your recommendations

00:34:23.960 --> 00:34:27.889
for relationships where only
one partner is non-monogamous?

00:34:27.889 --> 00:34:29.639
DEDEKER WINSTON: Do
you want to take that?

00:34:29.639 --> 00:34:30.739
JASE LINDGREN: Emily, why
don't you take that one?

00:34:30.739 --> 00:34:31.679
EMILY MATLACK: This one?

00:34:31.679 --> 00:34:31.699
Oh.

00:34:31.699 --> 00:34:33.110
JASE LINDGREN: Weren't we just
talking about this before?

00:34:33.110 --> 00:34:34.830
EMILY MATLACK: No, I
have the next question.

00:34:34.830 --> 00:34:35.250
DEDEKER WINSTON: I can take it.

00:34:35.250 --> 00:34:36.000
Yeah, I can take it.

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:36.949
EMILY MATLACK: Go for it.

00:34:36.949 --> 00:34:37.510
Go for it.

00:34:37.510 --> 00:34:39.020
DEDEKER WINSTON: I can take it.

00:34:39.020 --> 00:34:42.050
So I'll reiterate the question--
and we get a version of this

00:34:42.050 --> 00:34:42.949
question a lot--

00:34:42.949 --> 00:34:46.310
what do you do if one person
in a couple identifies

00:34:46.310 --> 00:34:48.920
as non-monogamous or wants to
be non-monogamous and the other

00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:50.929
person doesn't?

00:34:50.929 --> 00:34:52.429
It's a relatively
common situation

00:34:52.429 --> 00:34:54.170
that we see,
especially in couples

00:34:54.170 --> 00:34:56.219
who maybe have been
monogamous for a long time

00:34:56.219 --> 00:34:58.670
and then one of them realizes,
I think I want to try this,

00:34:58.670 --> 00:35:00.110
and this resonates with me.

00:35:00.110 --> 00:35:03.830
And the other person says,
I don't know about that.

00:35:03.830 --> 00:35:06.410
So these kind of relationships--
sometimes people call them

00:35:06.410 --> 00:35:10.370
mono/poly relationships or
some kind of variants of that--

00:35:10.370 --> 00:35:12.890
we have seen them
work, for sure.

00:35:12.890 --> 00:35:16.160
It requires a lot of compassion,
and a lot of communication,

00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:18.590
and a lot of moving slow,
and a lot of negotiation,

00:35:18.590 --> 00:35:20.180
and a lot of compromise.

00:35:20.180 --> 00:35:21.710
They can work.

00:35:21.710 --> 00:35:25.580
The other side of this, the
other prong of this answer,

00:35:25.580 --> 00:35:28.026
is reminding people that--

00:35:28.026 --> 00:35:29.150
let's say you meet someone.

00:35:29.150 --> 00:35:30.740
Maybe you identify
as non-monogamous,

00:35:30.740 --> 00:35:33.230
and you meet someone that
you really hit it off with,

00:35:33.230 --> 00:35:36.410
you really like them,
but they want monogamy.

00:35:36.410 --> 00:35:38.660
If someone's perfect for
you except for the fact

00:35:38.660 --> 00:35:42.260
that they want monogamy
and you want non-monogamy,

00:35:42.260 --> 00:35:44.007
that person isn't
perfect for you.

00:35:44.007 --> 00:35:45.590
That's the other
thing to bear in mind

00:35:45.590 --> 00:35:48.200
at the end of the day, which
is not an answer that people

00:35:48.200 --> 00:35:49.060
like to hear.

00:35:49.060 --> 00:35:50.140
JASE LINDGREN: It's not.

00:35:50.140 --> 00:35:51.515
The other thing
I did want to add

00:35:51.515 --> 00:35:56.900
about this is that polyamory
and ethical non-monogamy is not

00:35:56.900 --> 00:36:01.160
defined by how many people you
personally are dating right

00:36:01.160 --> 00:36:02.240
at this moment.

00:36:02.240 --> 00:36:04.910
But it's about what you expect
from your partners-- what

00:36:04.910 --> 00:36:07.520
are the things that you
expect your partners to be

00:36:07.520 --> 00:36:10.010
able to do or to not do.

00:36:10.010 --> 00:36:12.110
So my argument for
this, actually,

00:36:12.110 --> 00:36:14.780
is in that situation where
one partner is polyamorous

00:36:14.780 --> 00:36:16.760
and the other is
monogamous, that actually

00:36:16.760 --> 00:36:19.849
the monogamous partner
is the polyamorous one,

00:36:19.849 --> 00:36:21.890
if they're OK with having
that relationship where

00:36:21.890 --> 00:36:25.639
their partner is able
to see other people.

00:36:25.639 --> 00:36:26.680
We have another question?

00:36:26.680 --> 00:36:27.230
Yeah.

00:36:27.230 --> 00:36:27.900
DEDEKER WINSTON: You're back.

00:36:27.900 --> 00:36:29.775
AUDIENCE: I've seen a
couple of documentaries

00:36:29.775 --> 00:36:31.490
about non-monogamous
relationships,

00:36:31.490 --> 00:36:34.040
and they always take
place in the UK.

00:36:34.040 --> 00:36:36.249
So my question is, is the
UK a mecca of non-monogamy?

00:36:36.249 --> 00:36:38.373
EMILY MATLACK: We were
thinking about the ones that

00:36:38.373 --> 00:36:39.770
took place in San Diego.

00:36:39.770 --> 00:36:42.999
AUDIENCE: Or is this
just a documentary thing?

00:36:42.999 --> 00:36:45.290
DEDEKER WINSTON: Is the UK
more friendly for these kind

00:36:45.290 --> 00:36:46.640
of things, or is it just
a documentary thing--

00:36:46.640 --> 00:36:47.890
is that what the question was?

00:36:47.890 --> 00:36:49.284
AUDIENCE: Yeah, basically.

00:36:49.284 --> 00:36:51.200
JASE LINDGREN: Honestly,
I think this has more

00:36:51.200 --> 00:36:55.550
to do with the way that
media gets created here

00:36:55.550 --> 00:36:57.220
versus in the UK.

00:36:57.220 --> 00:36:59.330
Because we, actually,
just a few months ago,

00:36:59.330 --> 00:37:01.640
were talking with
a documentary crew

00:37:01.640 --> 00:37:03.860
from the BBC who was
working on something.

00:37:03.860 --> 00:37:05.960
And they wanted more
information from us.

00:37:05.960 --> 00:37:09.970
And they were even going
to film it in California.

00:37:09.970 --> 00:37:12.470
They were trying to decide if
it was going to be California,

00:37:12.470 --> 00:37:14.870
or Seattle, or I think
New York, were the places

00:37:14.870 --> 00:37:15.980
they were considering.

00:37:15.980 --> 00:37:18.200
But still a British
company because of the way

00:37:18.200 --> 00:37:22.430
that their public funding
for documentaries and things

00:37:22.430 --> 00:37:23.120
like that goes.

00:37:23.120 --> 00:37:26.060
I think that might
be part of why.

00:37:26.060 --> 00:37:32.100
But I would say, really,
based on what we've seen,

00:37:32.100 --> 00:37:36.810
both the coasts here in the
United States and Canada,

00:37:36.810 --> 00:37:40.670
as well as the UK, and even
Germany and Scandinavia--

00:37:40.670 --> 00:37:43.472
all have very healthy
polyamorous populations.

00:37:43.472 --> 00:37:44.930
EMILY MATLACK:
There was a Showtime

00:37:44.930 --> 00:37:46.670
show called "Polyamory--

00:37:46.670 --> 00:37:51.720
Married and Dating" that was
set in, I guess, San Diego.

00:37:51.720 --> 00:37:53.150
So that's interesting.

00:37:53.150 --> 00:37:55.290
I didn't even know about
the ones in the UK.

00:37:55.290 --> 00:37:58.140
Because that one is the
one that I always think of.

00:37:58.140 --> 00:37:59.640
DEDEKER WINSTON:
You do have to bear

00:37:59.640 --> 00:38:01.670
in mind that in the
states, we have this--

00:38:01.670 --> 00:38:03.470
compared to the
rest of the world--

00:38:03.470 --> 00:38:07.400
this very special
cocktail of puritanism

00:38:07.400 --> 00:38:08.870
that undercuts everything.

00:38:08.870 --> 00:38:11.210
And that still affects the
media that does get produced,

00:38:11.210 --> 00:38:12.240
or the stories that do get told.

00:38:12.240 --> 00:38:12.920
EMILY MATLACK: Very much.

00:38:12.920 --> 00:38:15.070
DEDEKER WINSTON: Although
it is slowly changing.

00:38:15.070 --> 00:38:15.360
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:38:15.360 --> 00:38:15.710
DEDEKER WINSTON: Thank you.

00:38:15.710 --> 00:38:16.940
JASE LINDGREN: Thank you.

00:38:16.940 --> 00:38:18.815
AUDIENCE: What do you
do when your partner is

00:38:18.815 --> 00:38:22.262
tired of processing, but you
feel that you're not done yet,

00:38:22.262 --> 00:38:24.090
and feel when I'm
satisfied or hurt,

00:38:24.090 --> 00:38:26.747
by dropping the conversation?

00:38:26.747 --> 00:38:28.580
EMILY MATLACK: So this
is an interesting one

00:38:28.580 --> 00:38:32.020
because this happens to me
a lot in my relationships.

00:38:32.020 --> 00:38:36.170
I have a partner who is very
good about his boundary of I'm

00:38:36.170 --> 00:38:38.360
done talking about this.

00:38:38.360 --> 00:38:40.400
And I'm the one who
keeps on wanting

00:38:40.400 --> 00:38:45.080
to go, and finish it,
and figure out, OK, I

00:38:45.080 --> 00:38:47.990
don't care if we talk all
night, I want to continue

00:38:47.990 --> 00:38:49.570
to speak about this.

00:38:49.570 --> 00:38:53.960
And we have an acronym that we
use on the show called HALT.

00:38:53.960 --> 00:38:57.260
And so it's hungry,
angry, lonely, or tired.

00:38:57.260 --> 00:38:58.940
We also added drunk--

00:38:58.940 --> 00:39:00.610
HALTD-- onto it.

00:39:00.610 --> 00:39:02.840
And if you're any
of those things,

00:39:02.840 --> 00:39:05.330
maybe it's not a good
time to do processing

00:39:05.330 --> 00:39:08.360
in your relationship, just
simply because you're probably

00:39:08.360 --> 00:39:12.320
not up to the best possible
you you can be in that moment.

00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:17.270
And I have to halt from time
to time in these relationships

00:39:17.270 --> 00:39:19.490
when I do want to
continue talking,

00:39:19.490 --> 00:39:22.460
just simply because I know a
little bit of time away from

00:39:22.460 --> 00:39:25.280
it-- even if it's 15 minutes--

00:39:25.280 --> 00:39:27.920
it can give me a little
bit of understanding

00:39:27.920 --> 00:39:29.400
about the situation.

00:39:29.400 --> 00:39:30.570
I can step away from it.

00:39:30.570 --> 00:39:32.510
And I think that that's
really important to do

00:39:32.510 --> 00:39:36.074
in those moments, especially
when you are angry, or upset,

00:39:36.074 --> 00:39:38.240
and you're not thinking
clearly, and you're probably

00:39:38.240 --> 00:39:40.115
going to say something
that you might regret.

00:39:40.115 --> 00:39:41.990
DEDEKER WINSTON: So I
think an important part

00:39:41.990 --> 00:39:44.300
of that is making sure that
there's not a dynamic where

00:39:44.300 --> 00:39:46.020
the two of you come
together to process,

00:39:46.020 --> 00:39:48.080
and there's always
one person who's

00:39:48.080 --> 00:39:50.150
shutting down the
conversation, as in, I'm tired,

00:39:50.150 --> 00:39:51.740
and this conversation is done.

00:39:51.740 --> 00:39:53.280
And that's always what happens.

00:39:53.280 --> 00:39:55.540
But that it's a
negotiation, that again,

00:39:55.540 --> 00:39:57.950
that you halt, and
you negotiate on when

00:39:57.950 --> 00:39:58.950
do we come back to this?

00:39:58.950 --> 00:39:59.210
Is it--

00:39:59.210 --> 00:40:00.320
EMILY MATLACK: 30
minutes, a day.

00:40:00.320 --> 00:40:01.500
DEDEKER WINSTON: Yeah,
do we go take a 30 walk

00:40:01.500 --> 00:40:02.450
and then come back to this?

00:40:02.450 --> 00:40:03.950
Is this we're going
to schedule this

00:40:03.950 --> 00:40:06.340
in our calendar for
this coming Friday

00:40:06.340 --> 00:40:08.515
when we'll sit down together
and revisit this again?

00:40:08.515 --> 00:40:10.640
EMILY MATLACK: And do you
want to talk about radar?

00:40:10.640 --> 00:40:12.056
DEDEKER WINSTON:
Yeah, definitely.

00:40:12.056 --> 00:40:15.560
So another way, I think, to
combat burnout on processing

00:40:15.560 --> 00:40:19.730
and on talking things through
is to have a regular established

00:40:19.730 --> 00:40:23.720
space that's like a relationship
check-in that happens--

00:40:23.720 --> 00:40:25.530
we recommend on a monthly basis.

00:40:25.530 --> 00:40:27.270
Some people do it
on a weekly basis,

00:40:27.270 --> 00:40:29.180
depending on their context.

00:40:29.180 --> 00:40:31.460
We created a
framework called Radar

00:40:31.460 --> 00:40:34.640
that's actually very loosely
based on Agile Scrum.

00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:36.214
It's a long explanation.

00:40:36.214 --> 00:40:38.380
EMILY MATLACK: Everybody
in here knows what that is.

00:40:38.380 --> 00:40:40.421
DEDEKER WINSTON: We created
this framework called

00:40:40.421 --> 00:40:43.190
Radar that's kind of
a process to follow

00:40:43.190 --> 00:40:45.140
during this monthly
check-in with your partner

00:40:45.140 --> 00:40:47.870
for going through all
these different topics

00:40:47.870 --> 00:40:50.060
to check in on, whether
it's sex, or the household,

00:40:50.060 --> 00:40:52.010
or talking about other
partners, or things like that,

00:40:52.010 --> 00:40:54.050
so that there's this
established time and space

00:40:54.050 --> 00:40:57.320
to talk about these
things, to help minimize

00:40:57.320 --> 00:41:00.200
day-to-day processing that
can really get you burnt out,

00:41:00.200 --> 00:41:02.480
if you know there's going
to be a dedicated time

00:41:02.480 --> 00:41:04.289
and space for my
concerns to be voiced

00:41:04.289 --> 00:41:05.580
and to talk about these things.

00:41:05.580 --> 00:41:08.570
So a combination of
knowing when it is OK to

00:41:08.570 --> 00:41:10.310
pause on processing
and knowing when

00:41:10.310 --> 00:41:12.697
it is OK to have an established
time for processing.

00:41:12.697 --> 00:41:15.280
EMILY MATLACK: Yeah, sometimes
we really need that safe space.

00:41:15.280 --> 00:41:18.770
I know that it allows me to not
get so worked up in the moment,

00:41:18.770 --> 00:41:21.620
when I'm like, OK, I can
save this for my radar

00:41:21.620 --> 00:41:24.470
because I'll have a little
bit of time between now

00:41:24.470 --> 00:41:28.777
and then where I'm not so
volatile in the moment.

00:41:28.777 --> 00:41:29.610
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:41:29.610 --> 00:41:30.055
DEDEKER WINSTON: Of course.

00:41:30.055 --> 00:41:31.096
EMILY MATLACK: Thank you.

00:41:31.096 --> 00:41:33.290
AUDIENCE: So a lot
of the traditional,

00:41:33.290 --> 00:41:35.750
as much as you can say--
for a couple of decades,

00:41:35.750 --> 00:41:38.990
polyamory advice has been
oriented towards couples

00:41:38.990 --> 00:41:39.980
who are opening up.

00:41:39.980 --> 00:41:42.680
And it makes sense,
given the society

00:41:42.680 --> 00:41:44.600
that we're starting from.

00:41:44.600 --> 00:41:50.160
And I'm wondering if you see
that changing, and if so,

00:41:50.160 --> 00:41:52.190
what impact that's having
on new relationships.

00:41:52.190 --> 00:41:53.523
JASE LINDGREN: Yeah, absolutely.

00:41:53.523 --> 00:41:56.330
We've definitely been
seeing this change a lot.

00:41:56.330 --> 00:41:58.800
When the term polyamory
was first created--

00:41:58.800 --> 00:42:04.400
which was around 1992, on some
DVS systems back in the day--

00:42:04.400 --> 00:42:08.600
and at that time, it was
being created almost sort

00:42:08.600 --> 00:42:11.270
of like growing out of
the swinger community,

00:42:11.270 --> 00:42:14.300
which was very much
focused on couples having

00:42:14.300 --> 00:42:17.007
this third person in
their relationship,

00:42:17.007 --> 00:42:19.090
or maybe a few other people
in their relationship,

00:42:19.090 --> 00:42:22.370
but who were less
important relationships.

00:42:22.370 --> 00:42:24.810
Whereas today, there's a
number of things happening.

00:42:24.810 --> 00:42:29.090
One is just essentially
the next generation

00:42:29.090 --> 00:42:32.630
of polyamorous people, where
there are a lot more people who

00:42:32.630 --> 00:42:36.050
identify as solo polyamorous,
which is a term for people who

00:42:36.050 --> 00:42:38.450
are polyamorous who are
not looking to become part

00:42:38.450 --> 00:42:40.970
of that nesting partnership.

00:42:40.970 --> 00:42:44.210
They're not looking for someone
to own a house with and really

00:42:44.210 --> 00:42:46.680
settle in in that
traditional way.

00:42:46.680 --> 00:42:48.290
And there's also
relationship anarchy,

00:42:48.290 --> 00:42:52.049
which, as we mentioned, could
be a whole other talk by itself.

00:42:52.049 --> 00:42:53.840
And then the other
really interesting thing

00:42:53.840 --> 00:42:56.870
is that now, we have people
who are third generation

00:42:56.870 --> 00:42:59.580
polyamorous people, who
not only their parents,

00:42:59.580 --> 00:43:01.880
but their parents'
parents, we're polyamorous.

00:43:01.880 --> 00:43:04.160
They're obviously very
young at this point.

00:43:04.160 --> 00:43:05.700
But we're actually
having people who

00:43:05.700 --> 00:43:09.410
were raised with this from
the beginning, which is also

00:43:09.410 --> 00:43:14.660
very interesting, and definitely
changes the way that people

00:43:14.660 --> 00:43:16.280
approach these types
of relationships,

00:43:16.280 --> 00:43:19.820
and definitely gets us away from
that traditional model of just

00:43:19.820 --> 00:43:22.072
being centered
around one couple.

00:43:22.072 --> 00:43:24.530
DEDEKER WINSTON: And I don't
mean to self-promote too much.

00:43:24.530 --> 00:43:29.120
But I tried to do that
in my book as well.

00:43:29.120 --> 00:43:31.220
A decade ago when I first
started it, for me, it

00:43:31.220 --> 00:43:33.530
was like, oh, I'm opening up
a monogamous relationship.

00:43:33.530 --> 00:43:35.405
And there's all that
unique set of challenges

00:43:35.405 --> 00:43:36.600
that comes with that.

00:43:36.600 --> 00:43:40.189
But within the past
seven, eight years,

00:43:40.189 --> 00:43:41.480
that hasn't been my experience.

00:43:41.480 --> 00:43:44.570
In the past seven, eight years,
every relationship I've started

00:43:44.570 --> 00:43:47.420
has been open from the
very beginning, which

00:43:47.420 --> 00:43:51.620
also has its own unique set of
challenges, and pros, and cons.

00:43:51.620 --> 00:43:53.360
And also on our
podcast, we really

00:43:53.360 --> 00:43:54.890
try to be cognizant
of that as well,

00:43:54.890 --> 00:43:57.132
of knowing that it's
not all couple-centric.

00:43:57.132 --> 00:43:58.340
Not everybody is in a couple.

00:43:58.340 --> 00:44:01.790
Not everyone starts out
monogamous and then opens up.

00:44:01.790 --> 00:44:02.630
Because it's true.

00:44:02.630 --> 00:44:05.270
Again, contrary to what the
media would have you believe,

00:44:05.270 --> 00:44:07.670
there's a lot of
people who start

00:44:07.670 --> 00:44:08.880
their relationships this way.

00:44:08.880 --> 00:44:11.337
It's not always
the same process.

00:44:11.337 --> 00:44:12.170
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:44:12.170 --> 00:44:12.620
DEDEKER WINSTON: Thank you.

00:44:12.620 --> 00:44:13.711
EMILY MATLACK: Thank you.

00:44:13.711 --> 00:44:15.960
AUDIENCE: So you mentioned
coming out as the top thing

00:44:15.960 --> 00:44:17.584
that someone who's
polyamorous could do

00:44:17.584 --> 00:44:21.390
to help make a safe community.

00:44:21.390 --> 00:44:24.720
I've never tried
to be in a closet.

00:44:24.720 --> 00:44:30.120
But when I told my team this
week that, hey, here's a talk

00:44:30.120 --> 00:44:33.750
and you should go to it, there
were a large number of them,

00:44:33.750 --> 00:44:34.740
some of whom--

00:44:34.740 --> 00:44:37.080
most of whom I've worked
with for more than a year--

00:44:37.080 --> 00:44:40.320
who didn't know this
about me at all.

00:44:40.320 --> 00:44:45.300
How do you be out when
it's not directly related

00:44:45.300 --> 00:44:46.302
to your profession?

00:44:46.302 --> 00:44:48.510
DEDEKER WINSTON: Well, I
want you to talk about this.

00:44:48.510 --> 00:44:51.060
But just to give a
little bit of a preamble,

00:44:51.060 --> 00:44:55.080
that's definitely a phenomenon
of what we call mononomativity,

00:44:55.080 --> 00:44:57.270
which is similar to
heteronormativity, which

00:44:57.270 --> 00:44:59.870
is the assumption that
everyone is heterosexual

00:44:59.870 --> 00:45:01.120
and not even questioning that.

00:45:01.120 --> 00:45:02.580
And it's kind of
the same thing is

00:45:02.580 --> 00:45:05.820
that we have this monomormative
assumption that everyone

00:45:05.820 --> 00:45:07.440
is seeking monogamy,
or everyone is

00:45:07.440 --> 00:45:09.427
in a monogamous relationship.

00:45:09.427 --> 00:45:11.760
So that's the hard thing, is
even if you're not actively

00:45:11.760 --> 00:45:14.425
trying to lie, or cover
things up, or be in a closet,

00:45:14.425 --> 00:45:16.050
that there's still
this assumption that

00:45:16.050 --> 00:45:18.260
often gets placed upon people.

00:45:18.260 --> 00:45:20.950
EMILY MATLACK: And may
blow past them, regardless.

00:45:20.950 --> 00:45:24.000
it But I want you to share
your experience at work.

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:26.910
JASE LINDGREN: Yeah, so I worked
for a visual effects company

00:45:26.910 --> 00:45:28.110
in Los Angeles.

00:45:28.110 --> 00:45:30.240
And there's a similar
thing, where I even

00:45:30.240 --> 00:45:34.470
have the podcast to be able
to talk about while I'm there.

00:45:34.470 --> 00:45:37.302
But there is that
interesting balance of I

00:45:37.302 --> 00:45:39.510
don't want to be just throwing
it in everyone's faces

00:45:39.510 --> 00:45:40.334
all the time.

00:45:40.334 --> 00:45:42.000
But at the same time,
yeah, I would like

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:43.710
to be creating more awareness.

00:45:43.710 --> 00:45:48.660
And as someone who is willing
to spend the energy on talking

00:45:48.660 --> 00:45:50.580
about this and
answering questions,

00:45:50.580 --> 00:45:53.130
I'd like to put myself
out there for that.

00:45:53.130 --> 00:45:57.030
And what I found
is it's more just--

00:45:57.030 --> 00:46:01.050
as a polyamorous person,
on just a day-to-day level,

00:46:01.050 --> 00:46:06.230
it can be really easy to get
into these habits of using

00:46:06.230 --> 00:46:10.310
vague language around your
relationships of like, well,

00:46:10.310 --> 00:46:13.640
maybe I'll just say girlfriend,
when really what I mean

00:46:13.640 --> 00:46:14.540
is partner.

00:46:14.540 --> 00:46:17.420
Or really what I mean
is this person I just

00:46:17.420 --> 00:46:19.665
started dating that you
haven't heard about before,

00:46:19.665 --> 00:46:22.040
but you've already heard me
call someone else girlfriend.

00:46:22.040 --> 00:46:23.060
And if I just say
girlfriend, you're

00:46:23.060 --> 00:46:25.520
not going to ask me questions,
and I can tell my story

00:46:25.520 --> 00:46:29.765
and not have to stop it to
answer all your questions.

00:46:29.765 --> 00:46:32.912
But it's essentially trying
to pick the moments when

00:46:32.912 --> 00:46:34.370
you do have the
time and the energy

00:46:34.370 --> 00:46:38.360
to have those conversations,
and to just work it

00:46:38.360 --> 00:46:42.470
into your story in the
same way that if I have

00:46:42.470 --> 00:46:46.800
a male partner, rather than
trying to avoid that fact,

00:46:46.800 --> 00:46:48.350
I would just say,
oh, my boyfriend.

00:46:48.350 --> 00:46:51.980
Or even just saying my partner
will make people go, what?

00:46:51.980 --> 00:46:53.692
What do you mean by partner?

00:46:53.692 --> 00:46:55.400
Because we have that
association with it.

00:46:55.400 --> 00:46:56.930
It's just like
finding little ways

00:46:56.930 --> 00:47:01.790
to put that in the conversation,
or something like, oh, I'm

00:47:01.790 --> 00:47:03.110
going on a first date tonight.

00:47:03.110 --> 00:47:04.310
I'm excited about it--

00:47:04.310 --> 00:47:05.090
when you're having
that like, what

00:47:05.090 --> 00:47:06.756
are you doing this
weekend conversation.

00:47:06.756 --> 00:47:09.080
It's finding those
little ways to be

00:47:09.080 --> 00:47:12.260
just a little more conscious
about that mononormative

00:47:12.260 --> 00:47:15.290
assumption that everyone's
going to be coming at it with,

00:47:15.290 --> 00:47:18.350
to just make that little
mention to make it clear what

00:47:18.350 --> 00:47:20.227
your relationships are like.

00:47:20.227 --> 00:47:21.560
That's something I found for me.

00:47:21.560 --> 00:47:22.299
But I agree.

00:47:22.299 --> 00:47:23.840
I've definitely
found that especially

00:47:23.840 --> 00:47:26.990
as new people get hired, that
conversation will come up.

00:47:26.990 --> 00:47:29.060
And maybe someone
else will mention it.

00:47:29.060 --> 00:47:31.400
And then the new person
is like, wait, what?

00:47:31.400 --> 00:47:32.360
EMILY MATLACK: Whoa.

00:47:32.360 --> 00:47:34.276
JASE LINDGREN: So yeah,
it is something that's

00:47:34.276 --> 00:47:36.210
kind of an ongoing process.

00:47:36.210 --> 00:47:37.180
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:47:37.180 --> 00:47:38.221
JASE LINDGREN: Thank you.

00:47:38.221 --> 00:47:39.270
EMILY MATLACK: Thank you.

00:47:39.270 --> 00:47:41.936
AUDIENCE: I have one just
for the sake of clarity.

00:47:41.936 --> 00:47:43.560
Could you clearly
define the difference

00:47:43.560 --> 00:47:45.265
between polyamory and polygamy?

00:47:45.265 --> 00:47:46.640
DEDEKER WINSTON:
Yes, yeah, 100%.

00:47:46.640 --> 00:47:47.820
EMILY MATLACK: Absolutely.

00:47:47.820 --> 00:47:49.080
DEDEKER WINSTON: And
it just goes-- really,

00:47:49.080 --> 00:47:49.870
it's quite simple.

00:47:49.870 --> 00:47:52.170
It goes down to just
the roots of the word.

00:47:52.170 --> 00:47:55.740
So poly meaning many,
amory meaning love.

00:47:55.740 --> 00:47:59.130
Polygamy-- so gamy
refers to spouse.

00:47:59.130 --> 00:48:01.470
So specifically, it
means many spouses.

00:48:01.470 --> 00:48:03.480
It's not gender specific.

00:48:03.480 --> 00:48:05.790
We have a term polygyny,
which is having

00:48:05.790 --> 00:48:07.200
multiple female partners.

00:48:07.200 --> 00:48:10.020
Or polyandry, which is
multiple male partners.

00:48:10.020 --> 00:48:14.460
But culturally, when people
use the word polygamy,

00:48:14.460 --> 00:48:16.780
the image that comes to
mind is bearded men named

00:48:16.780 --> 00:48:18.412
Ezekiel with child brides.

00:48:18.412 --> 00:48:20.370
That's what we think of
when we think polygamy.

00:48:20.370 --> 00:48:23.910
And so even though polygamy
just means multiple spouses,

00:48:23.910 --> 00:48:25.620
we usually try to
discourage people

00:48:25.620 --> 00:48:28.080
from using polyamory and
polygamy interchangeably,

00:48:28.080 --> 00:48:31.080
just because of the fact that
polygamy carries this really

00:48:31.080 --> 00:48:32.770
charged image along with it.

00:48:32.770 --> 00:48:34.020
JASE LINDGREN: A very sexist--

00:48:34.020 --> 00:48:36.210
DEDEKER WINSTON: And a very
sexist, unhealthy image.

00:48:36.210 --> 00:48:37.668
EMILY MATLACK:
Polyamory, you don't

00:48:37.668 --> 00:48:40.470
have to be married, whereas
the assumption is, in what,

00:48:40.470 --> 00:48:42.480
polygamy, that
people are married,

00:48:42.480 --> 00:48:43.749
but there are multiple wives.

00:48:43.749 --> 00:48:44.790
JASE LINDGREN: Thank you.

00:48:44.790 --> 00:48:46.949
That's a great
clarifying question.

00:48:46.949 --> 00:48:48.240
DEDEKER WINSTON: Really quick--

00:48:48.240 --> 00:48:51.090
just the fact that
we, over the course

00:48:51.090 --> 00:48:54.060
of running the podcast, over
the course of myself doing

00:48:54.060 --> 00:48:56.640
the work that I
do, I have worked

00:48:56.640 --> 00:48:58.456
with people who
are monogamous, who

00:48:58.456 --> 00:49:00.080
are swingers, who
are polyamorists, who

00:49:00.080 --> 00:49:01.470
are relationship anarchists.

00:49:01.470 --> 00:49:03.810
And I think when we
started the podcast,

00:49:03.810 --> 00:49:06.720
we thought, well, this is
going to be a special advice

00:49:06.720 --> 00:49:08.640
podcast with special
advice for people

00:49:08.640 --> 00:49:10.950
in non-monogamous relationships.

00:49:10.950 --> 00:49:13.100
And now four years
later, we're finding

00:49:13.100 --> 00:49:16.050
it's a lot of the same
advice for every single type

00:49:16.050 --> 00:49:19.710
of relationship that you
need vulnerable honest

00:49:19.710 --> 00:49:23.280
communication, that you need
to choose to trust your partner

00:49:23.280 --> 00:49:25.110
rather than fear your
partner, or that you

00:49:25.110 --> 00:49:27.030
need to take care of
yourself, that you

00:49:27.030 --> 00:49:30.160
need to have boundaries--
that applies across the board.

00:49:30.160 --> 00:49:34.042
And so what that says
to me is that either--

00:49:34.042 --> 00:49:36.000
regardless of our
relationship choices-- either

00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:38.730
we're more similar
than we are different,

00:49:38.730 --> 00:49:41.010
or we're just really not
that creative as a podcast.

00:49:41.010 --> 00:49:42.930
[LAUGHTER]

00:49:42.930 --> 00:49:45.300
EMILY MATLACK:

00:49:45.300 --> 00:49:49.500

Google Play.

00:50:11.219 --> 00:50:13.260
DEDEKER WINSTON: We have
a very old Google+ page.

00:50:13.260 --> 00:50:14.410
I'm sorry about that.

00:50:14.410 --> 00:50:15.743
EMILY MATLACK: Don't look at it.

00:50:15.743 --> 00:50:16.650
Please don't.

00:50:16.650 --> 00:50:20.330
But also, Dedeker Winston

Polyamory," which is for sale.

Yes.

00:50:27.090 --> 00:50:28.520
So with that, thank you.

00:50:28.520 --> 00:50:28.980

JASE LINDGREN: Thank you.

00:50:30.021 --> 00:50:32.930
