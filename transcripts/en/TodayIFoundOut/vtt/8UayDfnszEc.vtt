00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.510
The humble pineapple is most often seen today
either sitting proudly in the centre of an

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:21.509
uncomfortably well stocked fruit bowl or being
used as the home of a lovable talking sponge.

00:00:21.509 --> 00:00:27.220
However, between the 16th and 18th centuries,
pineapples were so expensive and rare that

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:30.510
they were often displayed like fine works
of art.

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.309
Converting exactly how much a whole pineapple
cost back in the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.450
to modern day dollars is almost impossible
to do with any real accuracy.

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:45.920
That said, the general ballpark estimates
tend to ring in at around five to ten thousand

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:51.719
dollars per pineapple, depending on such things
as the quality of the fruit and season.

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.399
So how did this particular piece of fruit
come to be so valuable?

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:59.710
After the pineapple was first encountered
by Europeans on the island of Guadeloupe during

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:04.610
Christopher Columbus’ second trip to the
Caribbean in November of 1493, efforts were

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:09.560
quickly set in motion to find a way of reliably
producing the fruit back in Europe.

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.979
(The fruit itself is indigenous to South America
and had been cultivated there for centuries

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.450
prior to its “discovery” by Columbus.)

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:21.820
Despite sinking vast sums of money into the
problem, European royalty, who positively

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:26.640
adored the fruit for its natural sweetness
(sugar and sugary items being in short supply),

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.409
for centuries after its “discovery” the
only real way to obtain a pineapple was to

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:36.200
pay to have one directly imported, which was
no cheap affair.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.221
Many transport ships of the age were too slow
and conditions too hot aboard the vessels

00:01:40.221 --> 00:01:42.369
to keep whole pineapples from rotting during
the journey.

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:46.750
So to get a whole pineapple fruit safely from
the plant to one’s table in Europe took

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.470
the fastest ships and most favorable weather
conditions.

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:54.189
As a result, virtually the only people who
could afford to purchase a whole pineapple,

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:59.359
let alone eat one while it was perfectly ripe,
were royalty or the ridiculously wealthy.

00:01:59.359 --> 00:02:03.649
The first step to allowing the rich, instead
of just the super rich, a chance to own or

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:08.700
even look at a pineapple wouldn’t come for
another two centuries after its “discovery”,

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:14.790
when the Dutch were able to begin successfully
cultivating the fruit in the very late 1600s.

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.630
Exactly who first managed to grow a pineapple
in a non-tropical climate isn’t known for

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:23.140
sure, though a woman named Agnes Block is
generally credited as being the earliest to

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.670
do so around 1687.

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.580
While earlier accounts of fruit producing
pineapple plants in Europe do exist, whether

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:33.550
or not these plants were cultivated in Europe
or simply transferred to the continent as

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:35.340
juveniles isn’t clear.

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.100
More important than Block in the pineapple
saga, however, was Dutch cloth merchant, Pieter

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:43.990
de la Court, who is often cited as the individual
who devised the most efficient (at the time)

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:47.450
method of growing pineapples in a non-tropical
climate.

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:51.680
His method was mostly comprised of utilising
hotrooms that were kept consistently warm

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:52.680
and humid.

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.360
These had to be carefully designed in order
to vent the smoke and hot fumes out of the

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:00.610
structure, while keeping the weather inside,
as well as the soil temperature, within very

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:02.099
specific ranges.

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:06.319
Accidentally burning down one’s pineapple
hotroom or killing the plants with smoke was

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:09.300
a very common thing in the early going.

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:13.590
After news of Court’s ability to grow pineapples
and other exotic plants and fruits year round

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:18.080
reached England, many nobles sent their gardeners
to the Netherlands to learn his techniques

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:20.380
first hand at considerable expense.

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:24.390
If you’re curious about why the Dutch had
such a stranglehold on Pineapple production,

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:28.850
it’s largely because the Dutch West India
Company enjoyed an almost total monopoly on

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:33.180
trade in the Caribbean at the time, allowing
wealthy Dutch citizens to import numerous

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.670
pineapple plants to experiment with, despite
the expense.

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:41.209
As you can probably imagine from the many
stereotypes that exist about British weather,

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:45.560
growing pineapples in England proved to be
rather difficult and it’s noted that only

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:50.459
exceptionally skilled or vastly wealthy gardeners
were capable of such a feat.

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:54.800
A man called John Rose is often mistakenly
attributed with growing the first pineapple

00:03:54.800 --> 00:04:00.890
in England because of the existence of a painting
commissioned by Charles II in 1675 in which

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:04.579
he’s clearly shown presenting the king with
a ripe pineapple.

00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:08.180
As it turns out, the pineapple seen in that
painting, which was based on a real encounter

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:12.780
the King had, was imported from the Bahamas
and ripened in England by Rose.

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:19.750
As for the real first pineapple grown on English
soil, that didn’t exist until around 1714-1716

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:25.090
when a Dutchman called Henry Telende was able
to grow one for his employer, Matthew Decker,

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:30.080
who subsequently had a painting commissioned
in 1720 to celebrate the not unimpressive

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:31.080
achievement.

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:35.100
Telende’s method of growing pineapples was
quite involved, managing to maintain the perfect

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:40.229
soil temperature via a specially designed
hothouse containing tan pits lined with pebbles

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:41.229
inside.

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:46.020
On top of the pebbles, he placed manure, then
on top of that sat tanners’ bark (oak bark

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:47.020
soaked in water).

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:50.270
Finally, the pot containing the pineapple
plant was placed in that.

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:54.190
Manure by itself created too much heat in
the early going, but the tanners’ bark helped

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:58.650
regulate that and provide a more even heat
over time, keeping a steady soil temperature

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:02.460
within the very specific range needed for
growing pineapple plants.

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:06.360
Even after growing pineapples on English soil
became a possibility, getting hold of one

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:11.220
was still so costly that many nobles didn’t
eat them, opting instead to simply display

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:16.040
them around their homes as one would a precious
ornament or carry them around at parties.

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:20.370
Those who weren’t quite as affluent could
also rent a pineapple for a few hours at a

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:21.370
time.

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:24.470
This pineapple would be passed around from
renter to renter for their respective parties

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:28.590
over the course of several days until finally
being sold to the individual who could actually

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:30.139
have the right to eat it.

00:05:30.139 --> 00:05:34.080
Because of this, even among those who’d
handled pineapples, very few ever actually

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:36.770
experienced what it was like to eat a pineapple.

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:41.360
Due to the natural sweetness of the pineapple,
which was described as being akin to “Wine,

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:45.699
Rosewater and Sugar” all mixed together,
the fruit was seen as nothing short of a delicacy

00:05:45.699 --> 00:05:51.259
by the notoriously sweet-toothed English elite
living in a time when refined sugar was a

00:05:51.259 --> 00:05:52.699
very expensive commodity.

00:05:52.699 --> 00:05:56.889
Charles II in particular was said to love
pineapple, partly due to its sweetness and

00:05:56.889 --> 00:06:00.949
partly due to him being amused by the fact
the fruit looked like it was wearing a tiny

00:06:00.949 --> 00:06:05.300
crown; as a result, Charles II often referred
to the fruit as the “King-pine”.

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:10.400
A final reason the pineapple was so popular,
at least with artists, was its unconventional,

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:11.630
striking appearance.

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:16.800
As 16th century Spanish historian Gonzalo
Fernandez de Oviedo y Valdes stated, “I

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:21.090
do not suppose that there is in the whole
world any other of so exquisite and lovely

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:22.110
appearances…

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:27.830
My pen and my words cannot depict such exceptional
qualities, nor appropriately blazon this fruit

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:33.090
so as to particularize the case fully and
satisfactorily without the brush or the sketch.”

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:36.669
Dunmore_PineappleIn fact, after the pineapple’s
introduction to England, it became a prominent

00:06:36.669 --> 00:06:41.919
feature of art and architecture of the period,
such as Scotland’s now famous Dunmore Pineapple

00:06:41.919 --> 00:06:44.660
(pictured right), commissioned in 1761 by
the Earl of Dunmore.

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:47.970
So the next time you order a pizza and see
that they casually put pineapple on it when

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:49.750
you clearly told them not to (because who
on Earth would want to sully delectable pizza

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:50.750
with a sweet fruit?

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:54.050
;-)), remember that three centuries ago, even
just having said fruit, let alone discarding

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:59.889
bits of it off your main dish, would have
been the ultimate sign of wealth and excess.

00:06:59.889 --> 00:07:03.831
Today, you might have heard of the tradition
of presenting someone with a pineapple as

00:07:03.831 --> 00:07:05.349
a housewarming present.

00:07:05.349 --> 00:07:19.449
This tradition goes back to the time described
in the preceding article when presenting such

00:07:19.449 --> 00:07:47.300
a gift was seen as a magnificent gesture.
