1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:05.060
One of the things about hunter that's really toxic hating is that his sort of

2
00:00:05.671 --> 00:00:10.671
self destructive path becomes romantic when you read it and you get involved in

3
00:00:11.401 --> 00:00:14.870
his work and you kind of mimic it,
you know,
it's,
uh,

4
00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.800
that's the greatest fallacy I think.

5
00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:21.000
I think what he was trying to say with self destruction was that this was an

6
00:00:21.001 --> 00:00:24.480
incredible threat to our American democracy.
Now,
I don't mean that,
I mean,

7
00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:28.050
I mean his snow romanticism teaching his,
well,

8
00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.610
I mean the romantic aspect of it was that his work was fantastic.

9
00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.230
I mean,
window was till it wasn't,
it was fantastic till it was,
it wasn't,
I mean,

10
00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:41.220
he understood what it was in the filial it was,
but he lived in with,

11
00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.230
he spent much more time within the consequences of that bingeing than he did

12
00:00:46.231 --> 00:00:48.900
within the success of the bingeing.
And that,

13
00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:53.460
I think he knew that his letters,
it's really beautiful and heartbreaking.

14
00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.470
And in his writing too,
I mean,

15
00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.530
I think that's what's been missed about him is there's no romanticism and self

16
00:00:58.531 --> 00:01:00.690
destruction right towards the end.

17
00:01:00.691 --> 00:01:04.920
He definitely lost his productivity and Yon Warner talked about that in the
Alex,

18
00:01:04.921 --> 00:01:08.460
give me document three.
He just,
sticky fingers was a great,
the document I,

19
00:01:08.461 --> 00:01:12.930
the new book on the new book on Yon Winter has great moments of Thompson the 70s

20
00:01:12.931 --> 00:01:15.840
just being kinda lost.
Yeah.
You know,
I think,

21
00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.190
I think we got to remember that we have an incredible times in American history.

22
00:01:20.191 --> 00:01:23.520
We have times that are going to burn brightly and it's up to each rider to

23
00:01:23.521 --> 00:01:26.520
decide how they'd like to burn next to it.
And if you're going to burn brightly,

24
00:01:26.521 --> 00:01:28.230
they may not have other times.

25
00:01:28.231 --> 00:01:31.860
And that's I think an American thing where you can wager that bright flame,

26
00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.900
which means you may have nothing left afterwards,

27
00:01:33.901 --> 00:01:38.610
but Thompson knew that he may have to live in that kind of afterlife at Juan.

28
00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.060
Juan Thompson writes about it so beautifully straight as I taught myself.

29
00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.440
There's some,
some footage of him when he was writing for,

30
00:01:46.441 --> 00:01:50.610
I forget what newspaper somewhat.
Was it somewhere in the Pacific northwest.

31
00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:55.620
What,
what was your writing for?
Who is the author of playing off the rail?

32
00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.570
D Google.
Uh,
playing off the rail.
There's a guy who was a journalist,

33
00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.010
but year,
do you think it was David Mccumber?
Yes.
David McCumber.

34
00:02:05.011 --> 00:02:08.460
David McCumber employed hunter for awhile when David was,
um,

35
00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.980
I forget what publication he was working for,

36
00:02:10.981 --> 00:02:14.340
but there's some footage of them community communicated together and you know,

37
00:02:14.341 --> 00:02:18.240
just trying to get hunter husband San Francisco was in San Francisco and hunters

38
00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.650
out of his fucking mind.
I mean,
it was younger.
I mean,
he wasn't even that old,

39
00:02:22.651 --> 00:02:26.970
but he was just wrecked.
He just couldn't communicate.
He couldn't talk.
And uh,

40
00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:31.260
you know,
he made be,
he makes a beast.
You escape the pain of articulation.

41
00:02:31.261 --> 00:02:33.660
You escape the pain of saying this is what's wrong.

42
00:02:33.661 --> 00:02:37.230
And American Society for him to say the way he did one of his great essays from

43
00:02:37.231 --> 00:02:41.160
1964.
So by going to Hemingway's,
um,
Ketchum,
Idaho,

44
00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:46.110
I'm grave in Hemingway's house and it's gorgeous because it talks about

45
00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.150
Hemingway was a good writer,

46
00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:52.320
one of the best writers when he was writing about an a period.

47
00:02:52.321 --> 00:02:54.000
He understood the 1940s,
1930s,

48
00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.600
when there was a firmness to the reality that he could articulate.

49
00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.220
One of the writers goals is give a pattern to chaos,

50
00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:01.440
is to give an articulation of cass.

51
00:03:01.441 --> 00:03:05.590
But what happens in the 1960s when the chaos is multiplying repeatedly,

52
00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:08.380
somebody like Hemingway becomes a literal relic.

53
00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:12.160
Like his narrative no longer fits into the present that he's in.

54
00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.110
And Thompson saw Hemingway's decline and he wrote about Hemingway's,
um,

55
00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:18.080
a suicide bomber.

56
00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:22.450
His narrative doesn't fit Hemingway's idea of what America was and what a man

57
00:03:22.451 --> 00:03:26.860
should be fit perfectly with what I think the twenties to the forties when we

58
00:03:26.861 --> 00:03:27.401
experienced.

59
00:03:27.401 --> 00:03:31.030
But I think in the early 1960s with our social upheaval of civil rights,
of,
um,

60
00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:35.020
you know,
political upheaval,
Hemingway,
it was confusing to him.
It didn't,

61
00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:36.280
it didn't fit anymore.

62
00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:39.610
Like his way of operating no longer articulated the present.

63
00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:43.990
And so Hemingway's last act was to take away his ability to say anything at all.

64
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.140
That was his only,
the last thing anyone ever said was to say,

65
00:03:47.141 --> 00:03:50.170
I'm not gonna say anything anymore.
Was the suicide that Hemingway committed.

66
00:03:50.171 --> 00:03:54.250
And Thompson wrote about that cordially.
Yeah.
When,

67
00:03:54.251 --> 00:03:57.700
when he was young,
when he wanted to kill him himself,

68
00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:02.890
it was almost unsurprising,
you know,

69
00:04:02.891 --> 00:04:07.210
when,
when I read that he had died,
I remember going,
Oh man,

70
00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:12.430
well I guess,
yeah.
You know what I mean?
I mean,

71
00:04:12.431 --> 00:04:15.640
it's like you knew that he was deteriorating rapidly.

72
00:04:15.641 --> 00:04:20.500
You knew that he had really bad hips.
He had had hip replacement surgery,
um,

73
00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:22.900
the Ralph stuff and leg.
Yeah.

74
00:04:22.901 --> 00:04:27.901
Ralph Steadman had drawn this very crazy image of him with the artificial hip

75
00:04:29.201 --> 00:04:32.050
and yeah,
it looked like pain,
you know?
I mean,

76
00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:35.920
but I think that it stopped my place to even deal with that because one

77
00:04:35.921 --> 00:04:37.690
Thompson's book writes about that moment,

78
00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:40.600
or one time Thompson was in the house and that's,
that's,

79
00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:43.810
that's his and one rights shoe to flee about the stakes of it,

80
00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:47.910
how painful it was to the people that loved him chorus,
everything about it.
Um,

81
00:04:47.911 --> 00:04:51.880
and how that,
even if that's a logical outcome at that's not,
no,
it needed it.

82
00:04:51.881 --> 00:04:54.250
So it's interesting,
I would say read stories.

83
00:04:54.251 --> 00:04:59.250
I tell myself that moment is so honestly and brilliantly written by one.
No,

84
00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:04.260
I'm sure both Bamo oh I was getting at is that at the time of his death,

85
00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:08.640
you know,
he was in to sort of,
uh,

86
00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:14.860
he was deteriorating so badly.
He was wearing diapers.
His,

87
00:05:14.861 --> 00:05:17.980
his entire cause of his alcoholism has ability to control.
A spotter was gone.

88
00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:22.300
And so one gave this wonderful speech at George Mason when he came out and he's

89
00:05:22.301 --> 00:05:23.650
like,
how do you write honestly about your father?

90
00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:26.870
And he asked the question of like,
should I include this detail?
And he was like,

91
00:05:26.871 --> 00:05:29.110
if my father was alive,
I couldn't include that.

92
00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:32.560
But that's why I chose innocence to write my book when my father was dead

93
00:05:32.561 --> 00:05:34.960
because I think my father would want me to write honestly,

94
00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:38.020
but also not want me to include that if he was still alive.

95
00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:40.930
And so he included that detail and he talked about that,

96
00:05:40.931 --> 00:05:43.720
how the struggle to include that detail,

97
00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:46.180
which I think brilliantly articulate what you're saying,

98
00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:49.870
which is the deterioration in the sadness of it.
And I mean,

99
00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:52.810
we have finite amounts of energy or effort.
We really do.

100
00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:56.620
We have to take care of ourselves.
And if we don't,
we will pay that price,
um,

101
00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:58.280
at point,
we're going to pay it anyway.

102
00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:02.360
So we're all headed to the same place that we want to or not,
you know?

103
00:06:02.361 --> 00:06:07.361
And so I think hundreds of really terrifying and beautiful example of one wager

104
00:06:08.061 --> 00:06:12.650
of chips that were made for that 1960 and 1970s and I think the best way to

105
00:06:12.651 --> 00:06:14.420
honor that as to,
you know,

106
00:06:14.421 --> 00:06:19.421
apply the brilliance that he forged and carved to the situation we have right

107
00:06:19.611 --> 00:06:21.500
now with corruption.
Donald Trump.
