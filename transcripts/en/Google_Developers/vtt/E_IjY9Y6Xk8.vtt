00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:20.779
Welcome to the postulation phase 2 of the 
Developer Bus. We will propose a challenge

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:26.239
for you to solve. Ready? Let us begin.
In the + DeveloperStation of the Developer Bus

00:00:26.239 --> 00:00:32.119
there are 120 developers, 3 of them 
at 3pm hear a rumor about 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:35.659
the launch of a new feature 
of the cloud platform.

00:00:35.659 --> 00:00:41.579
Each of them communicates this rumor every 30 minutes 
to 3 developers who didn't know this. This

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.739
mechanism occurs cyclically.
What is the exact time that everyone 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:50.379
knows about this new release? You know?
