00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:02.290
- On an island off the coast of Tanzania,

00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:04.700
are the ruins of a city that
was a hub of global trade

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:07.090
for centuries, right
up until the Europeans

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:09.293
showed up and spoiled everything.

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:15.730
I'm Samir Patel, deputy
editor of Atlas Obscura,

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:18.053
and this is Kilwa Kisiwani.

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:27.840
To get to the ruins of Kilwa
Kisiwani, you first have to get

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.170
to the tiny island of
Kilwa Masoko, get a permit,

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.270
and then head to the dock at
the southern end of the island

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.220
and convince someone who has
a boat to take you across.

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:39.560
As soon as you wade through
the surf to the island,

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:41.890
you'll find yourself in the
ruins of maybe the greatest

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:43.483
city of the Swahili culture.

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.430
Before Europe's Age of
Exploration, starting

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.420
in the 10th century, a bunch
of rich sultanates arose

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.540
on the East African coast, kind of like

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:57.200
the city-states of Renaissance Italy.

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.410
The biggest was Kilwa Kisiwani,
which made its fortunes

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:03.020
by playing the global
markets, trading the riches

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:04.490
of the African interior

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:07.560
(gold, ivory, timber, spices, even slaves)

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.520
to the Middle East, India,
and then on to Europe

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.510
and even to China.

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:13.940
It was even mentioned in
John Milton's "Paradise Lost"

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:16.040
as one of the great kingdoms of the Earth.

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:18.680
The site today is a ruin,

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.000
but the standing remains are spectacular.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.390
They're all made of giant blocks

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:24.830
of limestone called coral rag.

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:26.200
You'll see the Great Mosque,

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.610
it's the oldest standing
mosque in the region

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:30.450
which had 16 domes originally

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.330
(10 of them of still intact).

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.100
You'll see a fort called
Husuni Ndogo, and the remains

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.000
of a bunch of other, smaller buildings.

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:40.290
But the real highlight, which
you have to take a boat to

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:41.710
because it's on the other side

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:44.630
of a mangrove forest, is Husuni Kubwa,

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.040
the grand palace built by
Sultan al-Hasan ibn Sulaiman

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.840
in the 14th century, at the
height of the city's power.

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.430
You have to enter by boat,
at the base of a cliff,

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.960
and then you climb these
worn stairs to the hilltop

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:57.520
to the ruins of the palace.

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.850
There's a giant cliffside octagonal bath,

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.540
a residence with 100 rooms,
a stepped greeting court,

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:04.200
with candle niches in the wall.

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.780
But it was a little too ambitious.

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:06.860
For some reason we don't know,

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:08.310
the sultan never finished it.

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.740
The question of who built
this city was much debated

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:13.540
in the early 20th century.

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.280
Old accounts said it was
founded by a Persian prince

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.660
who bought the island from
a local king for cloth,

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.430
enough cloth to encircle the whole island,

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:21.700
and then destroyed the bridge

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.510
that connected it to the mainland.

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.200
This actually turned
out to be a classic bit

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.597
of colonial thinking, that
Africans couldn't possibly

00:02:27.597 --> 00:02:31.070
have built such an international,
sophisticated city,

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:33.853
a multicultural center,
and a global trade network.

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.220
Later excavations at
another of the stone towns

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.810
on the Swahili coast, Shanga in Kenya,

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.390
show clearly that the Swahili culture

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:43.970
was homegrown in Africa
and it picked Islam

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.350
and its architectural styles-

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:49.530
the minarets, the mosques, the domes-

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.710
to make itself more
appealing to Arab traders.

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:53.890
They cherry-picked their
influences from the successful

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:55.860
parts of other cultures until it all came

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:57.390
to an end in the 16th century.

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:59.680
That's when the Portuguese
showed up, building forts,

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.730
demanding tribute, and
generally mucking things up.

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.070
A lot of the stone towns
were hastily abandoned

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:08.380
around this time, and though
it's hard to say exactly why,

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:10.360
losing control of the
trade that made them rich

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:11.860
was probably a big part of it.

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:15.950
So this is one of the great, little-known

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:17.830
and little-studied medieval civilizations

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:20.200
of the world, like a Venice of its time.

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.230
And it's actually not really gone.

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.220
There's still nearly 2
million people living on the

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.820
East African coast who identify as Swahili

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:28.870
and millions more who speak the language.

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:31.603
