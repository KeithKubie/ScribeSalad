00:00:13.435 --> 00:00:16.126
How many of you are tired

00:00:16.674 --> 00:00:21.135
of seeing celebrities adopting kids
from the African continent?

00:00:21.159 --> 00:00:22.738
(Laughter)

00:00:24.342 --> 00:00:26.696
Well, it's not all that bad.

00:00:28.573 --> 00:00:29.941
I was adopted.

00:00:31.451 --> 00:00:34.153
I grew up in rural Uganda,

00:00:35.495 --> 00:00:38.263
lost both my parents
when I was very, very young.

00:00:39.978 --> 00:00:41.697
And when my parents passed,

00:00:42.467 --> 00:00:48.608
I experienced all the negative
effects of poverty,

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:50.979
from homelessness,

00:00:51.003 --> 00:00:52.772
eating out of trash piles,

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:54.689
you name it.

00:00:56.603 --> 00:00:58.077
But my life changed

00:00:59.038 --> 00:01:02.851
when I got accepted into an orphanage.

00:01:03.808 --> 00:01:06.155
Through one of those
sponsor-an-orphan programs,

00:01:06.924 --> 00:01:10.631
I was sponsored and given an opportunity
to acquire an education.

00:01:11.963 --> 00:01:14.073
I started off in Uganda.

00:01:14.097 --> 00:01:17.851
I went through school, and the way
this particular program worked,

00:01:17.875 --> 00:01:20.083
you finished high school
and after high school,

00:01:20.107 --> 00:01:23.767
you go learn a trade --
to become a carpenter, a mechanic

00:01:23.791 --> 00:01:25.591
or something along those lines.

00:01:26.559 --> 00:01:29.427
My case was a little different.

00:01:30.308 --> 00:01:34.401
The sponsor family that was sending
these 25 dollars a month

00:01:34.425 --> 00:01:36.837
to this orphanage to sponsor me,

00:01:36.861 --> 00:01:38.713
which -- I had never met them --

00:01:39.702 --> 00:01:41.537
said, "Well ...

00:01:42.813 --> 00:01:45.419
we would like to send you
to college instead."

00:01:46.538 --> 00:01:47.766
Oh -- it gets better.

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:48.833
(Laughter)

00:01:48.857 --> 00:01:51.693
And they said, "If you get the paperwork,

00:01:51.717 --> 00:01:54.620
we'll send you to school
in America instead."

00:01:56.856 --> 00:01:58.443
So with their help,

00:01:59.287 --> 00:02:02.583
I went to the embassy
and applied for the visa.

00:02:03.216 --> 00:02:04.605
I got the visa.

00:02:04.629 --> 00:02:08.660
I remember this day like it was yesterday.

00:02:09.054 --> 00:02:12.418
I walked out of the embassy
with this piece of paper in my hand,

00:02:12.442 --> 00:02:14.157
a hop in my step,

00:02:14.181 --> 00:02:15.882
smile on my face,

00:02:15.906 --> 00:02:19.293
knowing that my life is about to change.

00:02:20.875 --> 00:02:22.465
I went home that night,

00:02:23.168 --> 00:02:24.982
and I slept with my passport,

00:02:25.006 --> 00:02:27.313
because I was afraid
that someone might steal it.

00:02:27.337 --> 00:02:29.192
(Laughter)

00:02:29.216 --> 00:02:30.636
I couldn't fall asleep.

00:02:31.446 --> 00:02:32.764
I kept feeling it.

00:02:33.896 --> 00:02:35.725
I had a good idea for security.

00:02:36.324 --> 00:02:38.893
I was like, "OK, I'm going
to put it in a plastic bag,

00:02:38.917 --> 00:02:42.424
and take it outside and dig a hole,
and put it in there."

00:02:43.706 --> 00:02:45.651
I did that, went back in the house.

00:02:45.675 --> 00:02:48.628
I could not fall asleep. I was like,
"Maybe someone saw me."

00:02:48.652 --> 00:02:49.803
I went back --

00:02:49.827 --> 00:02:50.837
(Laughter)

00:02:50.861 --> 00:02:53.635
I pulled it out, and I put it
with me the entire night --

00:02:53.659 --> 00:02:56.617
all to say that it was
an anxiety-filled night.

00:02:56.641 --> 00:02:57.791
(Laughter)

00:02:58.203 --> 00:03:02.254
Going to the US was,
just like another speaker said,

00:03:02.278 --> 00:03:04.632
was my first time to see a plane,

00:03:04.656 --> 00:03:08.017
be on one, let alone sit on it
to fly to another country.

00:03:09.172 --> 00:03:11.681
December 15, 2006.

00:03:12.061 --> 00:03:13.951
7:08pm.

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:17.549
I sat in seat 7A.

00:03:18.009 --> 00:03:19.352
Fly Emirates.

00:03:21.427 --> 00:03:25.105
One of the most gorgeous,
beautiful women I've ever seen walked up,

00:03:26.246 --> 00:03:29.052
red little hat with a white veil.

00:03:29.792 --> 00:03:32.725
I'm looking terrified,
I have no idea what I'm doing.

00:03:33.391 --> 00:03:35.617
She hands me this warm towel --

00:03:35.641 --> 00:03:37.722
warm, steamy, snow white.

00:03:39.686 --> 00:03:42.000
I'm looking at this warm towel;

00:03:42.024 --> 00:03:45.418
I don't know what to do with my life,
let alone with this damn towel --

00:03:45.442 --> 00:03:47.319
(Laughter)

00:03:47.343 --> 00:03:50.161
(Applause)

00:03:51.712 --> 00:03:53.051
I did one of the --

00:03:53.075 --> 00:03:55.565
you know, anything anyone
could do in that situation:

00:03:56.043 --> 00:03:58.740
look around, see what
everyone else is doing.

00:03:58.764 --> 00:03:59.948
I did the same.

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:05.586
Mind you, I drove about seven hours
from my village to the airport that day.

00:04:06.524 --> 00:04:08.574
So I grab this warm towel,

00:04:08.598 --> 00:04:11.743
wipe my face just like
everyone else is doing,

00:04:11.767 --> 00:04:13.213
I look at it --

00:04:13.237 --> 00:04:14.402
damn.

00:04:14.426 --> 00:04:15.918
(Laughter)

00:04:16.983 --> 00:04:18.821
It was all dirt brown.

00:04:18.845 --> 00:04:19.995
(Laughter)

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:26.195
I remember being so embarrassed
that when she came by to pick it up,

00:04:26.219 --> 00:04:27.446
I didn't give mine.

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:28.587
(Laughter)

00:04:28.611 --> 00:04:29.779
I still have it.

00:04:29.803 --> 00:04:31.474
(Laughter)

00:04:31.498 --> 00:04:33.468
(Applause)

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:37.888
Going to America opened doors for me

00:04:37.912 --> 00:04:40.802
to live up to my full God-given potential.

00:04:41.862 --> 00:04:43.391
I remember when I arrived,

00:04:43.415 --> 00:04:45.380
the sponsor family embraced me,

00:04:45.404 --> 00:04:48.733
and they literally had to teach me
everything from scratch:

00:04:48.757 --> 00:04:51.505
this is a microwave,
that's a refrigerator --

00:04:51.529 --> 00:04:54.238
things I'd never seen before.

00:04:54.262 --> 00:04:56.011
And it was also the first time

00:04:56.035 --> 00:04:59.397
I got immersed into a new
and different culture.

00:05:00.159 --> 00:05:03.498
These strangers showed me

00:05:04.381 --> 00:05:05.895
true love.

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:10.782
These strangers showed me that I mattered,

00:05:12.038 --> 00:05:14.425
that my dreams mattered.

00:05:22.165 --> 00:05:26.444
(Applause)

00:05:28.841 --> 00:05:29.991
Thank you.

00:05:32.708 --> 00:05:35.955
These individuals had two
of their own biological children.

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:39.247
And when I came in, I had needs.

00:05:39.691 --> 00:05:41.764
They had to teach me English,

00:05:41.788 --> 00:05:44.572
teach me literally everything,

00:05:44.596 --> 00:05:47.323
which resulted in them spending
a lot of time with me.

00:05:47.726 --> 00:05:53.160
And that created a little bit
of jealousy with their children.

00:05:55.155 --> 00:05:59.664
So, if you're a parent in this room,

00:05:59.688 --> 00:06:02.697
and you have those teenager children

00:06:02.721 --> 00:06:07.075
who don't want anything to do
with your love and affection --

00:06:07.099 --> 00:06:08.926
in fact, they find it repulsive --

00:06:09.701 --> 00:06:11.254
I got a solution:

00:06:11.278 --> 00:06:12.650
adopt a child.

00:06:12.674 --> 00:06:13.686
(Laughter)

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:14.950
It will solve the problem.

00:06:14.974 --> 00:06:17.105
(Applause)

00:06:19.274 --> 00:06:21.904
I went on to acquire
two engineering degrees

00:06:21.928 --> 00:06:24.398
from one of the best
institutions in the world.

00:06:25.173 --> 00:06:26.438
I've got to tell you:

00:06:26.462 --> 00:06:28.279
talent is universal,

00:06:28.303 --> 00:06:30.465
but opportunities are not.

00:06:31.738 --> 00:06:33.159
And I credit this

00:06:34.296 --> 00:06:37.844
to the individuals
who embrace multiculturalism,

00:06:38.747 --> 00:06:40.556
love, empathy

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:42.535
and compassion for others.

00:06:44.572 --> 00:06:47.574
We live in a world filled with hate:

00:06:47.598 --> 00:06:49.196
building walls,

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:50.514
Brexit,

00:06:50.538 --> 00:06:54.017
xenophobia here on the African continent.

00:06:55.326 --> 00:06:57.726
Multiculturalism can be an answer

00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:01.376
to many of these worst human qualities.

00:07:03.308 --> 00:07:06.096
Today, I challenge you

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:10.034
to help a young child
experience multiculturalism.

00:07:11.165 --> 00:07:15.248
I guarantee you
that will enrich their life,

00:07:15.272 --> 00:07:16.915
and in turn,

00:07:16.939 --> 00:07:18.317
it will enrich yours.

00:07:19.519 --> 00:07:21.183
And as a bonus,

00:07:21.207 --> 00:07:23.220
one of them may even give a TED Talk.

00:07:23.244 --> 00:07:24.727
(Laughter)

00:07:25.269 --> 00:07:27.634
(Applause)

00:07:30.218 --> 00:07:35.140
We may not be able to solve the bigotry
and the racism of this world today,

00:07:35.164 --> 00:07:38.868
but certainly we can raise children

00:07:39.772 --> 00:07:43.270
to create a positive,
inclusive, connected world

00:07:43.810 --> 00:07:45.387
full of empathy,

00:07:46.290 --> 00:07:47.568
love

00:07:47.592 --> 00:07:48.882
and compassion.

00:07:49.361 --> 00:07:50.533
Love wins.

00:07:50.557 --> 00:07:51.707
Thank you.

00:07:51.731 --> 00:07:54.770
(Applause)
