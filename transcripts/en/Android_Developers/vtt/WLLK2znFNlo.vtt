[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:07.420
NIKO SCHROER: My
name is Niko Schroer.

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:09.910
I'm a partner manager in
the Play App partnerships

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:13.270
team in Berlin, Germany, and
it's my absolute pleasure

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:15.909
to be here with
all of you today.

00:00:15.909 --> 00:00:18.450
JEENA JAMES: Did you guys have
fun at the concert last night?

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:19.450
[CHEERING]

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:20.610
Me too.

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:23.470
And I have a sore
throat to prove it.

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:24.710
Hello, everybody.

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:25.780
My name is Jeena.

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:27.520
I'm on the Play Apps
partnerships team

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:28.930
here in Mountain View.

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:32.229
Like Niko, I'm super
excited to welcome you here

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:33.640
to our session--

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:39.100
Tools and Tips to Boost User
Engagement and Retention.

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.280
I/O 2017 has been
incredibly exciting,

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.770
with a lot of great
announcements.

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:47.200
We heard that the
Android ecosystem

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:52.000
has grown tremendously, with
the number of developers that

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.750
have over a million
monthly installs that have

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:00.200
grown 35% in the last year.

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:05.950
There are 2 billion monthly
active Android devices today.

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:10.240
And people have
downloaded 82 billion apps

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:11.680
from the Play Store.

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.850
That's amazing, and it's all the
hard work that you have put in.

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.764
So give yourself a
round of applause.

00:01:17.764 --> 00:01:20.234
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.310
In the last three days, we have
had so many really inspiring

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:32.380
conversations with developers
such as yourselves here at I/O,

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:34.150
and they have come
and told us how

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:36.100
they're excited
for this session,

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.310
because boosting engagement
within their apps

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:41.420
is one of the most
important topics for them.

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.720
NIKO SCHROER: And we
find it exciting indeed.

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.260
We, of course, completely agree
that boosting user engagement

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:51.737
is a key topic.

00:01:51.737 --> 00:01:53.320
If you quickly-- or
if you all quickly

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.840
recall Sunday's
keynote on Wednesday,

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.470
actually he talked about the
reach and also the engagement

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:00.970
that our own products are seeing
within the first, probably,

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:04.870
three minutes of the keynote.

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:07.060
But then talking about
user engagement today,

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:11.560
it's also very humbling, because
optimizing for user engagement

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.870
is a constant challenge
for developers.

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:18.380
We totally understand that.

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:23.350
And I think we can all agree
that boosting user engagement

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:24.640
is not a tool.

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.270
It's not a single tip.

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:30.120
It's not even a
single best practice.

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.610
It's the combination
of a lot of things

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.630
that have to be done right, and
have to be constantly optimized

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:39.790
in order for it to work.

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.260
So from our daily work with
developers in different regions

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:44.910
and with different
backgrounds, we

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.190
know that even for the
smartest developers,

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:51.930
staying on top of all of
these details all the time

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:52.900
can be very hard.

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:57.580
So that is why in
today's sessions,

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:59.420
we want to do the following.

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:01.930
We're going to give
you a holistic overview

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.630
of proven best practices
on how to boost

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:08.120
user engagement and apps.

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.760
And to underline that we
are not making this up,

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.940
we actually have examples from
some of the leading developers

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:16.100
around the world this
year with you, and to show

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:18.980
that it actually works.

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:20.814
So Jeena, shall we
take a look at what

00:03:20.814 --> 00:03:21.980
we are going to cover today?

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:23.870
JEENA JAMES: Absolutely.

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:27.440
So it starts with defining
your objective for engagement.

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.540
Now, if you do not
know what exactly you

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:32.870
want your users to
engage, you would not

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:35.210
know what you want to boost.

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:38.780
With a clear objective in
mind for improving engagement,

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:42.230
then it's all about testing
which optimization can

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:44.900
increase engagement for you.

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:49.400
NIKO SCHROER: Yeah, and once
you define the optimization

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.210
and the engagement
objective, and you've

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:54.260
found a feature
that performs best,

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.090
you also want to
release it smartly.

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:58.135
It's very important to
land with your users.

00:04:01.614 --> 00:04:03.530
Topic number four we're
going to look at today

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:04.790
is great onboarding.

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:08.090
It's a topic that's really,
really close to my heart.

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:09.920
When it comes to
user engagement,

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:12.680
it's just such a crucial
step in the user's journey.

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:18.970
JEENA JAMES: Also crucial are
smart and successful content

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:21.829
launches, to give your
users exactly what they

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:25.060
are looking for as well
as stimulate greater

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:27.340
and long-term engagement.

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:30.340
And finally, building an
effective communication

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:33.820
strategy, specifically
around notifications.

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:37.450
And that can help drive
further user awareness.

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:39.034
Wow, that's a lot
of things that we're

00:04:39.034 --> 00:04:40.158
going to be covering today.

00:04:40.158 --> 00:04:40.910
NIKO SCHROER: Yep.

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:42.580
JEENA JAMES: So Niko, do
you want to kick it off

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:43.372
with the first one?

00:04:43.372 --> 00:04:44.163
NIKO SCHROER: Sure.

00:04:44.163 --> 00:04:44.950
Let's go, right?

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:45.700
Let's unpack this.

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:50.780
So defining your
engagement objective

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:53.580
really starts with something
that sounds very simple,

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:56.960
but yet can be very
tricky to actually get to.

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:59.000
You have to have a
clear idea of what's

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.790
your proposition to users.

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:06.020
What is it that makes
your business stand out?

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:08.520
What makes your app or the
service you offer special?

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:14.240
Based on that, how is it that
you actually want your user

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:17.434
to engage with your app?

00:05:17.434 --> 00:05:18.600
Let's look at some examples.

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:25.070
Everybody here knows
Airbnb, I guess.

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:28.700
Their value proposition
is to let customers

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:31.730
experience foreign
places in a unique way

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:34.250
by staying with locals.

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:37.160
Accordingly, for
Airbnb, engagement

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:39.440
is measured in nights booked.

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:41.000
And that is what
they optimized for.

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:47.320
EyeEm is a community
by photographers

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:49.840
for photographers.

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:55.710
Their engagement objective is
to get users to upload photos.

00:05:55.710 --> 00:06:01.450
EyeEm found that users uploading
one photo on day zero increases

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:03.310
day 7 retention by 2.5x.

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:09.770
Even further, users
uploading eight photos

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:12.590
over the first seven
days can be retained

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:15.500
over a much longer
period of time--

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:18.950
very clear objective that
they can optimize against.

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:21.950
And that works.

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:24.560
At YouTube, it's all
about watch hours,

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:29.430
and so are the optimizations
of the user experience.

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:32.240
And lastly, One
Football, an app that

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:35.150
provides football fans around
the world with live scores

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:39.980
and curated football news, they
look at different engagement

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:46.230
drivers, with the key one
being articles read per user.

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:48.720
So as you can see from
these different examples,

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:52.180
the definition of how to
drive user engagement,

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:54.890
or what use engagement means,
can be quite different.

00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:57.050
But what all of these
examples of these developers

00:06:57.050 --> 00:06:59.450
have in common is
that they individually

00:06:59.450 --> 00:07:03.200
have a very clear idea of
their engagement objective,

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:06.080
and thus how to drive
engagement with their users.

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:11.710
JEENA JAMES: So laying out
a clear engagement objective

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:15.740
is the basis on which you can
optimize the app experience.

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:19.330
You can have plenty of ideas,
larger, smaller features

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:21.100
that you're trying to improve.

00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:23.560
But how are you going to
identify which one actually

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:26.040
drives user engagement?

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:28.360
You would have to do
multiple experiments

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:30.410
and run a lot of tests.

00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:32.680
Now, start with a hypotheses.

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:35.900
Develop two or more
variants, and set up a test

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:38.530
or run about a
minimum period of time

00:07:38.530 --> 00:07:41.080
so that you can get a
statistically significant

00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:42.670
result.

00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:47.180
Now, individual factors may
vary because of the use cases.

00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:51.220
So lets take a look
at it with an example.

00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:55.220
One Football, a popular
football app constantly working

00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:58.770
towards driving their engagement
goal, as Niko mentioned,

00:07:58.770 --> 00:08:01.850
uses reading more articles.

00:08:01.850 --> 00:08:04.540
With several feature
options in mind,

00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:08.170
they use Firebase
Remote Config, and that

00:08:08.170 --> 00:08:12.100
lets them change app
components on the server side,

00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:15.770
and they are not making any
updates to the app itself.

00:08:15.770 --> 00:08:18.160
They are able to test
different variations

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:22.090
before they release the
best-performing option to all

00:08:22.090 --> 00:08:23.590
their users.

00:08:23.590 --> 00:08:25.840
Now, in this
particular experiment,

00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:27.970
they had three variations.

00:08:27.970 --> 00:08:32.620
The winning variation
saw an increase of 5%

00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:35.919
in sessions per user,
and also saw an increase

00:08:35.919 --> 00:08:41.200
of 6% in articles that
users were reading per user,

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:44.940
as a result that variation was
rolled out to all the users.

00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:46.900
But this is a great
example of someone

00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:49.330
who did that with a
combination of three things--

00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:51.990
the engagement objective
that was really clear,

00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:55.270
the ideas that they had for
optimization, and a tool

00:08:55.270 --> 00:08:57.910
like Firebase Remote Config
to make it all happen.

00:09:00.182 --> 00:09:02.140
NIKO SCHROER: By the way,
the One Football team

00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:02.950
is in the audience.

00:09:02.950 --> 00:09:04.546
Quick round of applause.

00:09:04.546 --> 00:09:05.170
There they are.

00:09:05.170 --> 00:09:07.535
[APPLAUSE]

00:09:09.430 --> 00:09:11.050
Great job, guys.

00:09:11.050 --> 00:09:14.920
So having defined the
objective and run a test

00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:17.860
with a successful
result is great.

00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:21.310
Now you really want to
make sure not to mess it up

00:09:21.310 --> 00:09:24.190
when releasing the feature
to a large set of users.

00:09:24.190 --> 00:09:25.900
What do I mean by that?

00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:28.090
You want to make sure that
the rollout is actually

00:09:28.090 --> 00:09:30.400
technically stable,
and that users actually

00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:31.735
notice what has changed.

00:09:34.290 --> 00:09:36.990
To make sure that you
land the future release,

00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:39.630
just follow a very
simple process.

00:09:39.630 --> 00:09:42.810
First, ensure that the new
build is technically stable.

00:09:42.810 --> 00:09:45.000
That is just very important.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.950
It was mentioned in
other talks before,

00:09:46.950 --> 00:09:51.420
but we see that 50% of
one-star reviews on Google Play

00:09:51.420 --> 00:09:55.500
mention topics complaining
about app stability and bugs.

00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:59.690
So with that, take as a proxy
for happy or unhappy users,

00:09:59.690 --> 00:10:01.980
and then those users
are pretty unhappy.

00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:03.550
And it's quite simple--

00:10:03.550 --> 00:10:09.420
unhappy users are much harder
to engage and retain, right?

00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:12.060
Secondly, leverage
the features you

00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:15.130
have on the Play console,
such as alpha and beta groups,

00:10:15.130 --> 00:10:19.740
go to soft launch, and then
gradually go to full rollout.

00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:23.130
And then for the user,
make sure that you actually

00:10:23.130 --> 00:10:25.860
visually guide them to
what's new in the app,

00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:29.940
as you can see from the Material
Design example on the slides.

00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:31.410
To support you in
this process, we

00:10:31.410 --> 00:10:34.110
launched a couple of new
reports in the Play console,

00:10:34.110 --> 00:10:37.140
which we strongly
recommend that you use.

00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:40.590
They were discussed in depth
in several other talks, which

00:10:40.590 --> 00:10:42.150
I recommended to check out.

00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:45.930
But just very quickly,
the pre-launch report

00:10:45.930 --> 00:10:48.810
now provides developers
with even more test coverage

00:10:48.810 --> 00:10:50.310
and understanding of your app.

00:10:50.310 --> 00:10:52.500
For example, you
get a great overview

00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:55.690
of key screens across devices.

00:10:55.690 --> 00:10:57.900
Secondly, the release
dashboard gives you

00:10:57.900 --> 00:11:02.490
updates on the release as
it happens with hourly data.

00:11:02.490 --> 00:11:05.640
Using both of these
reports is a best practice

00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:08.280
to release stable
updates and keeping

00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:11.550
users happy and engaged.

00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:15.720
If we take Play Store reviews
as a proxy another time,

00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:20.400
we see that 60% of users
rating apps with 5 stars

00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:24.410
actually praise speed,
design, and usability--

00:11:24.410 --> 00:11:25.290
as simple as that.

00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:32.620
OK, onto number four,
my favorite topic--

00:11:32.620 --> 00:11:35.540
user onboarding.

00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:38.470
User onboarding is
a unique opportunity

00:11:38.470 --> 00:11:40.690
to learn about
users' preferences

00:11:40.690 --> 00:11:42.910
and show them what is
great about your app.

00:11:45.990 --> 00:11:48.870
A great example of-- oh, sorry.

00:11:48.870 --> 00:11:51.150
So when optimizing
for that, keep

00:11:51.150 --> 00:11:52.560
a couple of things in mind.

00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:56.650
The onboarding should be
fast, seamless, and immersive.

00:11:59.230 --> 00:12:02.740
Ideally, the onboarding
doesn't feel like onboarding.

00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:06.940
Ideally it feels like it's
a contextual, core part

00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:10.190
of the user experience.

00:12:10.190 --> 00:12:12.770
A good example, and you see I
got really excited about that

00:12:12.770 --> 00:12:15.590
already, is health and
fitness developer Freeletics.

00:12:18.170 --> 00:12:21.050
So Freeletics gets
users really fit

00:12:21.050 --> 00:12:23.870
through individualized
workout plans.

00:12:23.870 --> 00:12:26.630
About onboarding, the
guys from Freeletics

00:12:26.630 --> 00:12:29.360
actually say they
don't onboard users.

00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:32.780
They directly and
progressively emerge them

00:12:32.780 --> 00:12:35.340
with the experience.

00:12:35.340 --> 00:12:39.410
So for new users, the immersive
product experience really

00:12:39.410 --> 00:12:41.630
starts with the
onboarding flow, where

00:12:41.630 --> 00:12:43.820
it's all about the
results that they want

00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:47.770
to achieve using Freeletics.

00:12:47.770 --> 00:12:52.150
Based on the onboarding, users
get a customized training plan,

00:12:52.150 --> 00:12:55.510
which engages them
as free athletes,

00:12:55.510 --> 00:12:59.050
to use the app several times
a week to train and become

00:12:59.050 --> 00:13:02.330
fitter and healthier.

00:13:02.330 --> 00:13:06.440
Another really cool
example is One Football.

00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:08.450
One Football's
onboarding process

00:13:08.450 --> 00:13:13.810
is designed to drive engagement
through personalization.

00:13:13.810 --> 00:13:15.470
Any football fans
in the audience?

00:13:15.470 --> 00:13:16.730
Quick show of hands--

00:13:16.730 --> 00:13:18.620
soccer, I'm sorry, soccer fans.

00:13:18.620 --> 00:13:20.360
There we go.

00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:24.860
So all of you will know what One
Football's research confirms--

00:13:24.860 --> 00:13:30.690
real football fans mostly
care about their one team.

00:13:30.690 --> 00:13:33.560
So the onboarding experience
of One Football's app

00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:35.930
is really optimized for that.

00:13:35.930 --> 00:13:38.690
So after downloading
the app, you

00:13:38.690 --> 00:13:41.840
select which one is
your favorite team.

00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:46.220
I really like Arsenal
London, so I selected them.

00:13:46.220 --> 00:13:48.270
On the second
screen, already it's

00:13:48.270 --> 00:13:52.220
Arsenal themed, as you
can see by the red color.

00:13:52.220 --> 00:13:55.580
As a user, I can now pick
which of Arsenal's competition

00:13:55.580 --> 00:13:58.740
I want to follow.

00:13:58.740 --> 00:14:00.240
Once I have done
that-- in my case,

00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:02.040
I probably selected
all of them--

00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:04.760
once I've done that, I'm done.

00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:07.290
Now my home screen, which
is what you see now,

00:14:07.290 --> 00:14:09.900
really centers about what's
most important to me.

00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:12.817
It's the latest
results of Arsenal--

00:14:12.817 --> 00:14:15.150
in this case, that we're going
to play Manchester United

00:14:15.150 --> 00:14:17.010
a couple weeks back.

00:14:17.010 --> 00:14:20.940
Further, my news stream
now really centers

00:14:20.940 --> 00:14:24.030
around Arsenal-specific news.

00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:28.530
And actually, so do
the push notifications.

00:14:28.530 --> 00:14:32.540
So thanks to a fast, very
simple and immersive onboarding

00:14:32.540 --> 00:14:35.240
experience, the One
Football experience

00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:37.750
is much more
personalized, relevant,

00:14:37.750 --> 00:14:39.500
and engaging to their users.

00:14:43.580 --> 00:14:46.370
And while it's not a must,
a lot of the advantages

00:14:46.370 --> 00:14:49.400
of great onboarding actually
come with offering users

00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:51.740
log-in functionality.

00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:54.200
For example, if you
really were cross-screen

00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:56.540
and you want to save
users' preferences,

00:14:56.540 --> 00:15:01.800
log-in is a super useful
thing to have for your users.

00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:04.490
But we know that building
an account infrastructure

00:15:04.490 --> 00:15:06.260
can be complex and challenging.

00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:09.170
So luckily, Google has
two really great solutions

00:15:09.170 --> 00:15:10.700
for that.

00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:13.420
Let's look at number one.

00:15:13.420 --> 00:15:16.390
Google Sign-in lets
users access your app

00:15:16.390 --> 00:15:19.900
with their Google login.

00:15:19.900 --> 00:15:23.440
In this example, I want
to show you Mobills Labs,

00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:25.500
It's a budget planning
app from Brazil.

00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:28.750
Offers a super quick
and fast log-in process

00:15:28.750 --> 00:15:31.220
using Google Sign-in.

00:15:31.220 --> 00:15:32.912
Mobills Labs, are you guys here?

00:15:32.912 --> 00:15:34.120
I know they were supposed to.

00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:35.129
Ah, there we go.

00:15:35.129 --> 00:15:36.295
OK, quick round of applause.

00:15:36.295 --> 00:15:37.840
[APPLAUSE]

00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:38.910
Quick shout out.

00:15:38.910 --> 00:15:41.790
[APPLAUSE]

00:15:41.790 --> 00:15:45.420
So after downloading
Mobills, the user

00:15:45.420 --> 00:15:48.150
taps to sign in with Google.

00:15:48.150 --> 00:15:50.340
They tap to confirm
which account

00:15:50.340 --> 00:15:53.780
they want to use from the
Google account selector,

00:15:53.780 --> 00:15:56.090
and they're in as
simple as that--

00:15:56.090 --> 00:15:58.310
super quick, super fast.

00:15:58.310 --> 00:16:02.100
According to the Mobills
CEO, Carlos Terceiro,

00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:07.190
log-ins increased by 300% after
implementing Google Sign-in,

00:16:07.190 --> 00:16:09.920
and it's now the most popular
choice for logging in.

00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:18.020
The second solution Google
offers for developers

00:16:18.020 --> 00:16:21.440
to make this very easy is
Smart Lock for Passwords.

00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:23.990
With Smart Lock for
Passwords, users

00:16:23.990 --> 00:16:29.210
can log into apps using their
credentials they have saved,

00:16:29.210 --> 00:16:34.070
which the developers, you, can
retrieve with a specific API.

00:16:34.070 --> 00:16:37.730
So the example here, or
there as well, shows Yazio.

00:16:37.730 --> 00:16:39.230
Yazio is a
calorie-counting app that

00:16:39.230 --> 00:16:42.990
helps its users develop
a healthier lifestyle.

00:16:42.990 --> 00:16:46.220
So after my week here,
I ate lots of burgers,

00:16:46.220 --> 00:16:48.750
and I want to go back and
live a healthier lifestyle.

00:16:48.750 --> 00:16:53.040
So I download Yazio, and from
here, the flow is super simple.

00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:57.590
I select my goal,
which is stay healthy.

00:16:57.590 --> 00:16:59.660
And after that, Yazio
lets me create an account.

00:17:03.370 --> 00:17:04.829
It's very straightforward.

00:17:04.829 --> 00:17:06.690
The Smart Lock at
email picker lets

00:17:06.690 --> 00:17:09.150
me pick which email I want
to use from my account.

00:17:12.096 --> 00:17:17.660
The details are prefilled, and
I only have to add the password,

00:17:17.660 --> 00:17:18.800
and I'm done.

00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:21.440
I'm in and I can
start using the app.

00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:24.170
Implementing Smart
Lock significantly

00:17:24.170 --> 00:17:27.650
improved the sign-in
experience for Yazio users,

00:17:27.650 --> 00:17:30.260
and saw some great results.

00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:33.760
Actually, sign-up
conversions increased by 14%,

00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:37.730
and over 70% of those
users used an email address

00:17:37.730 --> 00:17:39.470
that was suggested.

00:17:39.470 --> 00:17:40.820
I mean, why wouldn't you?

00:17:40.820 --> 00:17:42.560
I hate typing in my
email address myself.

00:17:45.550 --> 00:17:47.830
So for a personalized
app like Yazio

00:17:47.830 --> 00:17:53.450
that really depends on having
my user preferences saved,

00:17:53.450 --> 00:17:56.620
this is really crucial to engage
users, and a great example

00:17:56.620 --> 00:18:00.140
on how to use Smart
Lock for that.

00:18:05.804 --> 00:18:07.220
JEENA JAMES: Thank you.

00:18:07.220 --> 00:18:09.890
So the insights that you learn
from your user's preference

00:18:09.890 --> 00:18:12.680
during onboarding
that can be leveraged

00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:14.820
as you think about
boosting engagement

00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:17.480
with successful
content launches.

00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:21.050
Now, what do I mean by that?

00:18:21.050 --> 00:18:23.240
Game developers
have successfully

00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:25.220
done this in the
form of live ops.

00:18:25.220 --> 00:18:28.310
Have you heard of
live ops before?

00:18:28.310 --> 00:18:30.500
OK, let me tell you.

00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:33.300
They are a key focus for game
developers at the moment,

00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:36.430
and there are interesting
insights for app developers.

00:18:36.430 --> 00:18:41.270
Put simply, live ops is
running games as a service.

00:18:41.270 --> 00:18:45.200
Think of it as the game
becoming a dynamic product that

00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:48.590
is constantly changing,
giving players

00:18:48.590 --> 00:18:51.320
new experiences every day.

00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:55.460
The goal of live ops is to
augment engagement, stimulate

00:18:55.460 --> 00:18:59.660
monetization, and
reduce player churn.

00:18:59.660 --> 00:19:02.270
We see three
components to live ops.

00:19:02.270 --> 00:19:05.750
We see content, we
see sales, and events,

00:19:05.750 --> 00:19:08.600
and this combination has
proved very successful

00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:10.580
for game developers.

00:19:10.580 --> 00:19:16.480
Now, in the context of apps, let
me show that with an example.

00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:20.380
Memrise-- they're an innovative
language learning app.

00:19:20.380 --> 00:19:23.290
Are you guys in the audience?

00:19:23.290 --> 00:19:26.690
OK, so an innovative
language learning app

00:19:26.690 --> 00:19:30.680
ran a back-to-school offer
in September last year.

00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:35.510
To motivate users to start early
when the school year starts,

00:19:35.510 --> 00:19:38.720
they released beginner
and advanced versions

00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:43.190
of new language combinations
and ran a global campaign

00:19:43.190 --> 00:19:46.130
that also offered discounts
for their annual subscription

00:19:46.130 --> 00:19:48.140
program.

00:19:48.140 --> 00:19:50.150
This was a great
success for them,

00:19:50.150 --> 00:19:53.180
and it actually boosted
additional engagement

00:19:53.180 --> 00:19:56.180
from this particular
campaign and resulted in

00:19:56.180 --> 00:19:58.835
over 32% increase in revenue.

00:20:01.450 --> 00:20:04.490
Lastly, and probably
more importantly,

00:20:04.490 --> 00:20:07.030
an effective
communication strategy.

00:20:07.030 --> 00:20:11.950
That can be a great way to make
users aware of all the features

00:20:11.950 --> 00:20:14.600
that can drive engagement.

00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:18.160
App push notifications
are not new to anyone.

00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:19.300
They're not new to us.

00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:23.260
They're not new to us as
a developer or as a user.

00:20:23.260 --> 00:20:27.010
And there's so much innovation
happening there now,

00:20:27.010 --> 00:20:29.560
and it's a good time to
revisit your strategy

00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:32.030
around push notifications.

00:20:32.030 --> 00:20:34.270
So let's go through some
of the main characteristics

00:20:34.270 --> 00:20:36.210
of good notification.

00:20:36.210 --> 00:20:38.290
I say notification,
but these are also

00:20:38.290 --> 00:20:41.320
applicable to other
channels of communication,

00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:42.960
like in-app messaging, e-mails.

00:20:45.660 --> 00:20:47.917
Relevance-- sounds simple.

00:20:47.917 --> 00:20:50.250
You want to send messages
that are relevant to the user,

00:20:50.250 --> 00:20:50.910
right?

00:20:50.910 --> 00:20:54.660
But it can be really hard to
find out what is relevant.

00:20:54.660 --> 00:20:57.090
So think about sending
messages that matter

00:20:57.090 --> 00:20:59.880
to the user in the
context that they are in.

00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:01.890
Be mindful of the tone you use.

00:21:01.890 --> 00:21:04.980
Be mindful of the
language that you select.

00:21:04.980 --> 00:21:08.730
Also, be creative and
true to your brand.

00:21:08.730 --> 00:21:13.110
One way of ensuring that is to
actually give them the option,

00:21:13.110 --> 00:21:16.140
to let them select
various alternatives

00:21:16.140 --> 00:21:18.810
during the onboarding flow.

00:21:18.810 --> 00:21:22.470
Actionable-- notifications
can sometimes

00:21:22.470 --> 00:21:26.760
be used to inform, and sometimes
update content, as well

00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:30.390
as allow users to
take specific actions.

00:21:30.390 --> 00:21:32.316
Whatever action or
info that you want

00:21:32.316 --> 00:21:33.690
to show in your
notification, you

00:21:33.690 --> 00:21:36.150
want to make sure that
that is also accounted

00:21:36.150 --> 00:21:40.040
for in the engagement metrics.

00:21:40.040 --> 00:21:42.990
Personalized-- we're not equal.

00:21:42.990 --> 00:21:44.290
So are your users.

00:21:44.290 --> 00:21:46.800
They are not created equal.

00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:50.570
For effective communication,
segment your user base.

00:21:50.570 --> 00:21:53.690
Create cohorts and
find customized ways

00:21:53.690 --> 00:21:56.240
to tailor your
messaging to them.

00:21:56.240 --> 00:21:59.480
Also give them options
to opt in and opt out,

00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:02.150
or filter proactively.

00:22:02.150 --> 00:22:06.770
Timeliness-- raise your
hands if you have ever

00:22:06.770 --> 00:22:10.460
received not important
messages or notifications just

00:22:10.460 --> 00:22:13.710
when you're getting to bed.

00:22:13.710 --> 00:22:17.110
OK, so right message
at the right time

00:22:17.110 --> 00:22:20.690
and at the right frequency
can drive user engagement.

00:22:20.690 --> 00:22:22.470
Consider the day of the week.

00:22:22.470 --> 00:22:24.560
Consider the time
zone that they're in.

00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:28.010
And sometimes you can also give
them one-click alternatives,

00:22:28.010 --> 00:22:30.830
like read later.

00:22:30.830 --> 00:22:35.390
On Android, rich notifications
are incredibly valuable,

00:22:35.390 --> 00:22:39.710
and it's a valuable service that
drives meaningful engagement.

00:22:39.710 --> 00:22:43.400
And with every release we are
enhancing the feature set.

00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:45.170
Take a look at what
we're launching

00:22:45.170 --> 00:22:47.805
with Android O in the preview.

00:22:47.805 --> 00:22:50.180
And there are many features
around notifications that are

00:22:50.180 --> 00:22:52.842
coming as part of Android O.

00:22:52.842 --> 00:22:54.425
So let's take a look
at some examples.

00:22:57.270 --> 00:23:02.370
The Guardian-- do not
judge me of the example,

00:23:02.370 --> 00:23:04.070
but whatever the
political inclinations

00:23:04.070 --> 00:23:07.370
that we have, but let's take
a look at this example, which

00:23:07.370 --> 00:23:09.650
is a great example of
how they drove user

00:23:09.650 --> 00:23:14.580
engagement with their mobile app
during the recent US election

00:23:14.580 --> 00:23:19.460
by using new notifications
functionality in Android N.

00:23:19.460 --> 00:23:22.480
They used innovative
techniques to give their users

00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:26.570
a rich, real-time update
on the election results

00:23:26.570 --> 00:23:28.640
as they happened.

00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:30.740
As you can see,
the notifications

00:23:30.740 --> 00:23:32.330
are super creative.

00:23:32.330 --> 00:23:33.950
They used avatars.

00:23:33.950 --> 00:23:36.350
They had a real-time
progress bar

00:23:36.350 --> 00:23:39.950
to give you real-time
updates in a creative manner,

00:23:39.950 --> 00:23:44.270
and lots of up-to-date results.

00:23:44.270 --> 00:23:47.420
The Guardian saw an
impressive engagement

00:23:47.420 --> 00:23:51.680
of about 170,000
users who signed up

00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:55.310
to see the [INAUDIBLE]
with an average of five

00:23:55.310 --> 00:23:56.840
interactions per user.

00:23:59.900 --> 00:24:01.460
Another important
characteristic,

00:24:01.460 --> 00:24:04.130
as I mentioned before,
is when notifications are

00:24:04.130 --> 00:24:07.430
actionable whenever possible.

00:24:07.430 --> 00:24:11.730
CityMapper is an app that
gives users smart commute

00:24:11.730 --> 00:24:17.840
notifications, and it uses
an FYI, for your information,

00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:22.820
type of notifications at the
relevant time for the user.

00:24:22.820 --> 00:24:27.380
According to Gilbert Wedam, the
head of design at CityMapper,

00:24:27.380 --> 00:24:29.690
notifications on
Android, and therefore

00:24:29.690 --> 00:24:33.350
delivering notification
and information right

00:24:33.350 --> 00:24:36.710
to the user's log screen,
is such a powerful feature

00:24:36.710 --> 00:24:38.210
for them.

00:24:38.210 --> 00:24:40.820
Their notification for
daily commute updates

00:24:40.820 --> 00:24:43.700
with real-time
information is really

00:24:43.700 --> 00:24:46.700
useful for all their users
who are commuting and using

00:24:46.700 --> 00:24:49.280
that information
during their commute.

00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:52.970
And it's a great way to update
their users on any changes that

00:24:52.970 --> 00:24:57.040
take place and drive daily
reengagement to the app.

00:25:00.310 --> 00:25:03.300
I want to share another
example of creating relevance

00:25:03.300 --> 00:25:06.380
by combining innovative
technologies.

00:25:06.380 --> 00:25:09.690
I'm going to highlight Stocard,
who enables you to manage

00:25:09.690 --> 00:25:12.550
loyalty cards on your phone.

00:25:12.550 --> 00:25:16.020
They use the Awareness
API to notify you

00:25:16.020 --> 00:25:19.170
when you're near a chain
store with loyalty points

00:25:19.170 --> 00:25:21.150
that you are tracking.

00:25:21.150 --> 00:25:23.550
Now, what is Awareness API?

00:25:23.550 --> 00:25:28.740
The Awareness API unifies seven
location and contextual signals

00:25:28.740 --> 00:25:32.700
into a single API,
enabling you to create

00:25:32.700 --> 00:25:36.990
powerful context-based
experiences for your user

00:25:36.990 --> 00:25:40.440
with minimal impact
on system resources.

00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:44.310
So now you can combine
potentially processed context

00:25:44.310 --> 00:25:46.500
signals in new
ways that were not

00:25:46.500 --> 00:25:50.190
previously available to
you, while letting the API

00:25:50.190 --> 00:25:53.850
manage system resources so
that your app doesn't have to.

00:25:57.130 --> 00:25:59.050
Finally, in terms
of tools that you

00:25:59.050 --> 00:26:01.690
can use to drive
effective notifications,

00:26:01.690 --> 00:26:04.600
I want to highlight
Firebase Notifications.

00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:06.940
This is a free
service that enables

00:26:06.940 --> 00:26:11.750
targeted user notification
for mobile app developers.

00:26:11.750 --> 00:26:15.220
It is based on Firebase
Cloud Messaging,

00:26:15.220 --> 00:26:18.580
and provides an option if you
need a flexible notification

00:26:18.580 --> 00:26:24.370
system that requires little
in our effort to get started.

00:26:24.370 --> 00:26:27.790
They integrate very closely
with Firebase Analytics,

00:26:27.790 --> 00:26:29.650
so now you can
target notifications

00:26:29.650 --> 00:26:32.550
by customizing audiences.

00:26:32.550 --> 00:26:35.800
Now with notifications
targeted to user segments,

00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:38.500
you can contact
exactly the right user

00:26:38.500 --> 00:26:41.950
at the right time with
updates on available upgrades,

00:26:41.950 --> 00:26:44.140
features that you're
launching, or any other news

00:26:44.140 --> 00:26:45.790
that you want them to know.

00:26:45.790 --> 00:26:48.850
And this works across
Android, iOS, and web.

00:26:52.817 --> 00:26:53.650
NIKO SCHROER: Great.

00:26:53.650 --> 00:26:54.660
So here we go--

00:26:54.660 --> 00:26:58.390
six key areas for you
to optimize your app in

00:26:58.390 --> 00:27:01.480
to boost user engagement.

00:27:01.480 --> 00:27:04.490
Start with clearly
defining your objective.

00:27:04.490 --> 00:27:08.410
Test your features, and
then if you have a winner,

00:27:08.410 --> 00:27:11.080
release it smartly.

00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:13.597
Leverage the opportunity
that onboarding provides.

00:27:13.597 --> 00:27:15.430
It's really a key moment
in the user journey

00:27:15.430 --> 00:27:18.940
where you can learn
about users' preferences.

00:27:18.940 --> 00:27:21.430
And then strategically
launch content.

00:27:21.430 --> 00:27:25.960
And most importantly,
follow all of the superb

00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:28.000
tips about effective
notifications

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:30.700
Jeena just provided.

00:27:30.700 --> 00:27:33.550
So that is a good list of things
to get right and constantly

00:27:33.550 --> 00:27:35.220
improve.

00:27:35.220 --> 00:27:39.330
Yet we want to recommend you
add another area to optimize

00:27:39.330 --> 00:27:41.250
engagement in your app--

00:27:41.250 --> 00:27:43.890
behavioral insights.

00:27:43.890 --> 00:27:48.030
It is a super hot
topic, like super hot.

00:27:48.030 --> 00:27:51.990
Our expert, Jeni Fisher, put
over one year of research

00:27:51.990 --> 00:27:54.720
into it, and covered
this in a dedicated talk

00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:56.790
earlier this morning.

00:27:56.790 --> 00:27:59.610
So if you didn't get the
chance to check it out yet,

00:27:59.610 --> 00:28:01.744
we recommend you to follow
the link on the slides,

00:28:01.744 --> 00:28:04.410
and then we're probably going to
put it in the video description

00:28:04.410 --> 00:28:08.010
as well, to learn all
about how to leverage

00:28:08.010 --> 00:28:12.370
behavioral insights to boost
user engagement and retention.

00:28:18.170 --> 00:28:21.520
So we covered a lot of ground
with you today, and really

00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:22.900
hope it resonated with you.

00:28:22.900 --> 00:28:24.760
What do you think?

00:28:24.760 --> 00:28:25.260
Yeah?

00:28:25.260 --> 00:28:26.170
[APPLAUSE]

00:28:26.170 --> 00:28:26.670
Cool.

00:28:26.670 --> 00:28:29.490
[APPLAUSE]

00:28:29.490 --> 00:28:30.990
Thanks.

00:28:30.990 --> 00:28:34.020
And we do fully appreciate
that it's a lot of information.

00:28:34.020 --> 00:28:35.010
This is day three.

00:28:35.010 --> 00:28:36.810
You have heard a lot
of great sessions.

00:28:36.810 --> 00:28:39.143
You have watched a lot of
great sessions on livestreams,

00:28:39.143 --> 00:28:40.300
I hope.

00:28:40.300 --> 00:28:44.112
But as with every session, the
most important thing remains--

00:28:44.112 --> 00:28:46.320
what are you going to do
differently after this talk?

00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:52.060
What's next?

00:28:52.060 --> 00:28:55.380
Well, for today, we want to
make it very easy for you.

00:28:55.380 --> 00:28:57.160
We appreciate that it's warm.

00:28:57.160 --> 00:28:58.009
You're here.

00:28:58.009 --> 00:28:59.550
You want to go out
and enjoy the sun,

00:28:59.550 --> 00:29:01.175
or enjoy the rest of
the talks and then

00:29:01.175 --> 00:29:03.000
probably have a cool drink.

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:07.260
So for now, all we want you
to do is note down this link--

00:29:07.260 --> 00:29:09.540
nothing more.

00:29:09.540 --> 00:29:12.345
Write it down, or type it in
your phone, or take a picture.

00:29:12.345 --> 00:29:14.220
I will give you a moment
to actually do that.

00:29:25.860 --> 00:29:27.810
Cool.

00:29:27.810 --> 00:29:34.440
Then you can go and enjoy the
rest of I/O. But on Monday,

00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:39.240
or even if it's Sunday,
when you go back to work,

00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:41.990
go to the link.

00:29:41.990 --> 00:29:46.130
What you will find is our
app engagement checklist

00:29:46.130 --> 00:29:46.630
to download.

00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:53.610
It helps-- it reminds you of
all the areas you can optimize

00:29:53.610 --> 00:29:56.130
to boost user engagement.

00:29:56.130 --> 00:30:00.750
And actually, it provides a
set of questions you can use--

00:30:00.750 --> 00:30:03.900
you can ask yourself or
you can ask your team

00:30:03.900 --> 00:30:08.700
to identify the area and
where your app engagement has

00:30:08.700 --> 00:30:12.270
more room for improvement.

00:30:12.270 --> 00:30:14.850
So download this and use it.

00:30:14.850 --> 00:30:16.710
Go through the
questions, and then

00:30:16.710 --> 00:30:18.870
start optimizing
with the tips you

00:30:18.870 --> 00:30:21.600
learned today, and,
of course, everything

00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:24.720
you learned across the
last couple of days,

00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:27.900
and capture the full
opportunity Google Play offers

00:30:27.900 --> 00:30:30.530
to you as a developer.

00:30:30.530 --> 00:30:32.145
And with that--

00:30:32.392 --> 00:30:33.350
JEENA JAMES: Thank you.

00:30:33.350 --> 00:30:34.766
NIKO SCHROER: Thank
you very much.

00:30:34.766 --> 00:30:37.480
