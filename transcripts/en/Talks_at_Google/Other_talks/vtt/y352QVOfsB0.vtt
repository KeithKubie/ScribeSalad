JULIE GILHART: Thank you.

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:10.330
So Tess, I have to preface
this to say that when I first

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:12.970
met Tess, I was a
very hungry fashion

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:15.160
director, looking for talent.

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:19.520
And I was obsessed with
finding the best talent first.

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.150
And so rumor had
it that there was

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:27.040
someone who was doing production
for fashion shows that

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:32.240
was, in her spare time,
obsessively sewing things.

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.740
So in the meatpacking
district-- I

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:36.990
think that's where I first
met you, in the meatpacking

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:39.680
district, before the meatpacking
district was the meatpacking

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:44.730
district-- I went to
her studio, and I did.

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.520
I found this girl, and
she was obsessively

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.260
sewing at a sewing machine.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:55.664
But when I say obsessively, it
was, the crux of her collection

00:00:55.664 --> 00:00:57.330
was-- or there wasn't
even a collection.

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:58.720
It was just shirts.

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:02.000
And she was obsessively,
like, sewing

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.600
on the shirts' top stitching.

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.320
So in essence, you
had a shirt that

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.480
just had all these crazy
zigzaggy lines on the shirt.

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:13.850
So it looked very crafted.

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.600
And it was very
expensive, but very cool.

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.690
So I guess my first
question is-- and I never

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:23.870
thought about asking
this-- but what

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:32.390
possessed you to do
that in your spare time,

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:38.870
and how it led you to the--
I want to say indie brand,

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:43.460
but you're not up there in
the "lights, camera, action,"

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:44.610
I always like to say.

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.370
You're very, like,
steadfast and artistic

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:51.700
and doing your own thing,
and have garnered, actually,

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.810
a lot of respect in a
very-- without having

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.140
to shout your brand name.

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:04.030
So what inspired you or
possessed you to start that?

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:06.620
TESS GIBERSON: I knew I
wanted to have my own company.

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:09.410
So I was actually doing
the show production

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.990
to support building
my own company.

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.920
But I wanted to do it in my
own time, in my own pace.

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.730
So I was working with
the show production

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.340
to make enough money,
so then I could take off

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.220
two to three months at a time
to develop the collection.

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.840
So I always knew
in my head that was

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.000
my end goal was to
build my own company.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.450
It was always just like, I
wanted something of my own.

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.500
But my way of doing
it-- at that point,

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.000
I wanted to make
it very-- because I

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.630
had been at Calvin Klein.

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:39.560
And I had seen things
on a bigger scale.

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.110
And I had seen
things where it was

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.020
very-- everything was very
refined and very clean and very

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.520
modern.

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.110
But I wanted to make it my own.

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:51.680
So when I started working
on my own collection,

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.480
it was all about having this
personalization with the pieces

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.060
and really, really
making my own mark.

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.540
So that was my feeling,
but it was also, literally,

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:04.330
I was making my own
mark by making the mark

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:07.310
making that I was doing
on every single piece.

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:10.500
And in the beginning--
I mean, I think

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.630
I just wanted to
experiment, and to really

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:16.010
push myself as much as I could.

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:20.770
Because I knew at a certain
point, it would be more public.

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:24.030
And at that point when I met
you, it was still so personal.

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:26.150
And I could do anything.

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:29.210
And I hadn't revealed
it to anyone yet.

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:32.290
And I remember-- I mean, this is
stuff they always tell people.

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:36.880
Julie came, and she had me
come up to the Barney's offices

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:40.270
and said they wanted
to place an order.

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:42.230
And at the time I
was like, I really

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:43.950
don't think I can take an order.

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:47.096
I just don't know if I'm
ready to expand that much.

00:03:47.096 --> 00:03:48.720
Because I was just
selling to one store

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.300
and making one of a kind pieces.

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:53.200
And Julie had to-- actually,
she took me aside and she had

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:56.730
to really convince me that
I should take the order

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:58.330
for Barney's.

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:01.900
But it was really--
honestly, Julie

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:04.830
was the one who got me
started, who kind of just

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:09.340
got me into making
the production,

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:11.320
following the deliveries.

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:13.560
And I think I did it
for two more seasons

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:16.980
when I was working
part-time on my collection.

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:19.220
And then after that,
I just did full-time,

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:22.810
and then I started just full-on
doing my own collection.

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:30.880
JULIE GILHART: It's interesting
because there's so much support

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:38.100
for designers now, in terms
of mentorship and grants

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:42.110
and money and all
kinds of things.

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:44.080
And then, there wasn't.

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:46.260
But it's really interesting.

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:50.290
And maybe you can comment on
this, because in thinking, I've

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:53.060
been developing
designers my whole life.

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:57.740
And so the really great talents,
like the Nicolas Ghesquieres,

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:02.942
the [INAUDIBLE] the
Olivier Theyskens,

00:05:02.942 --> 00:05:06.870
those people didn't have
any of this support.

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:13.330
Now I can't say that today
there is that caliber out there.

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:17.950
So the only thing
I can think of is

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:21.290
it's the way that
we're doing things.

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:24.280
But I'm not sure--
I'm not a designer.

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:29.580
So I'm wondering what you think
of what you were doing back

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:32.340
then, because how you
describe that is exactly

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:35.920
the same way that Olivier
Theyskens started,

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:38.200
Alexander McQueen started.

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:39.900
That it's very
much more concerned

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:42.710
about the craft of the
clothing, rather than

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:44.880
the commerciality
of the clothing.

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:47.180
And it was a very
personal thing.

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:52.780
So I'm wondering, what are
your thoughts about that?

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:55.750
TESS GIBERSON: I
think when I started,

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:58.640
it was-- I left
Calvin Klein in '98.

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:04.320
So I spent from '98 to 2001 just
kind of incubating it myself,

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:06.750
just developing it.

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:13.310
And I think back then, the
only way to make it happen,

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:14.670
I wanted it so badly.

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:16.540
And it was just out of passion.

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:20.900
And there wasn't any CFDA,
Vogue fund didn't exist.

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:24.560
That wasn't until,
I think, 2003.

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:27.714
It was just, there was a
community of other designers.

00:06:27.714 --> 00:06:28.880
And we supported each other.

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:32.640
And it was through,
I think, peer support

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:36.600
and just-- I knew
inside what I wanted.

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:38.530
JULIE GILHART: What did
you want most, though?

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:42.031
What was it that
you wanted most?

00:06:42.031 --> 00:06:43.530
TESS GIBERSON: For
me at that point,

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:45.740
it was just the
personal expression.

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:47.820
I wanted to do
something that was me.

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:57.270
I wanted to put
my own vision out.

00:06:57.270 --> 00:06:58.960
Now I think about a company.

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:02.070
At that time, I wanted
to develop my own vision,

00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:03.980
and I wanted to express it.

00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:07.930
And I knew-- I've always
been very organized,

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:10.130
so I did things in
an organized way.

00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:14.074
But it was about having
this personal expression.

00:07:14.074 --> 00:07:15.490
JULIE GILHART:
That's probably why

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:17.800
Calvin-- working
at Calvin-- I mean,

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:21.120
I can kind of see a creative
person working there and seeing

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:24.100
how it's done on a mass
scale, but that you

00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:27.020
would want to do
something that was yours.

00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:30.980
And that's how Calvin started,
and Ralph Lauren and Donna

00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:32.040
Karan.

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:33.620
I mean, it's really interesting.

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:37.810
But I think what's
interesting now

00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:40.950
is all the access that we have.

00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:44.130
Like, we have two really
amazing collaborators

00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:45.260
that work with you.

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:50.930
And I think designers
have always collaborated

00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:56.780
with people, but it's
almost a part of your--

00:07:56.780 --> 00:08:03.130
it's a criteria in a way, like
who you're collaborating also

00:08:03.130 --> 00:08:04.280
is reflecting on you.

00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:07.470
Because everyone's
collaborating.

00:08:07.470 --> 00:08:11.520
TESS GIBERSON: I went to RISD,
and when I was in school,

00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:13.970
that was part of being at
RISD, was you collaborated.

00:08:13.970 --> 00:08:18.970
You collaborated with painters
or graphic designers or textile

00:08:18.970 --> 00:08:21.850
designers, and it was just
part of this give and take.

00:08:21.850 --> 00:08:25.130
And good ideas always came
from working with other people.

00:08:25.130 --> 00:08:28.040
So it was just very much the
way that I'm used to working.

00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:30.370
And when I first started,
I worked with my husband

00:08:30.370 --> 00:08:32.130
all the time, who's a painter.

00:08:32.130 --> 00:08:35.282
And it was just-- we started
the first couple of collections.

00:08:35.282 --> 00:08:36.490
We always were collaborating.

00:08:36.490 --> 00:08:38.870
And I pulled my sister,
who's an artist, into it.

00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:42.679
And then we started looking
out to friends who are artists.

00:08:42.679 --> 00:08:46.160
And I worked with filmmakers,
photographers, set designers,

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:47.089
lighting designers.

00:08:47.089 --> 00:08:48.630
And they were just
very close friends

00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:50.810
who also I respected
their work a lot.

00:08:50.810 --> 00:08:53.110
So it's just like,
I've always known

00:08:53.110 --> 00:08:54.880
collaboration is exciting.

00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:57.070
And when you respect
the other person's work,

00:08:57.070 --> 00:08:58.560
it's always good no matter what.

00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:01.720
I don't think about what
it has to look like.

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:03.560
And I don't second-guess it.

00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:06.390
It's just if I respect someone's
work and I like it a lot,

00:09:06.390 --> 00:09:07.350
it works out well.

00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:12.880
And so when I relaunched
the new company,

00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:14.970
that was very important
to continue that.

00:09:14.970 --> 00:09:17.030
And so I've continued
it, even though now we

00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:19.600
do things-- I don't
sew it myself anymore.

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:22.082
I don't-- it's different.

00:09:22.082 --> 00:09:23.040
It's on a bigger scale.

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:24.780
But I still maintain
the collaborations,

00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:27.500
because that's for my heart.

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:28.550
That's what I love to do.

00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:31.860
And that gives me so
much more creatively.

00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:34.590
And I met Alia, and
I loved her work.

00:09:34.590 --> 00:09:36.630
And I asked her to do
a video and it just

00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:38.010
continued from there.

00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:41.730
And then through a
friend, I met Caroline.

00:09:41.730 --> 00:09:43.080
And I loved what I heard.

00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:44.660
And then I met
her, and I thought,

00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:48.620
it was just an instant-- it was
just something intuitive that I

00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:50.840
knew and we
connected right away.

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:54.980
And first I asked her to be
in a presentation last year.

00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:56.830
And then I had her
do music, and then it

00:09:56.830 --> 00:09:59.290
was natural to ask her to
do the music for the video.

00:09:59.290 --> 00:10:01.892
So everything I do
is very intuitive.

00:10:01.892 --> 00:10:03.850
JULIE GILHART: So you
have sort of an entourage

00:10:03.850 --> 00:10:04.940
of collaborators.

00:10:07.972 --> 00:10:09.930
TESS GIBERSON: I have a
lot of nice collections

00:10:09.930 --> 00:10:11.155
of collaborations.

00:10:11.155 --> 00:10:12.155
But they're all genuine.

00:10:12.155 --> 00:10:15.060
They're people I
love and I respect.

00:10:15.060 --> 00:10:18.575
And it's just such a
natural relationship.

00:10:18.575 --> 00:10:22.940
JULIE GILHART: Isn't it
funny, because collaboration

00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:26.280
with many designers is all
about making more money.

00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:28.370
You collaborate with
a certain person

00:10:28.370 --> 00:10:30.580
so that it will
sell more product.

00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:34.580
And it sounds like
in your vernacular,

00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:37.520
that it's really collaborating
from an artistic and respect

00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:38.104
point of view.

00:10:38.104 --> 00:10:39.936
CAROLINE POLACHEK: Well,
if I may interject,

00:10:39.936 --> 00:10:42.920
Tess is actually a really easy
person to collaborate with too.

00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:45.710
I think a lot of designers have
gimmicks in each collection,

00:10:45.710 --> 00:10:47.917
or like maybe even a kind
of extremely intense theme

00:10:47.917 --> 00:10:49.750
that continues throughout
their collections.

00:10:49.750 --> 00:10:52.412
And I think in order to
collaborate with someone

00:10:52.412 --> 00:10:53.870
like that, you feel
like you really

00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:57.689
have to make something that
goes with the particular story

00:10:57.689 --> 00:10:58.230
or the theme.

00:10:58.230 --> 00:11:02.020
But Tess' work is so
open that it really

00:11:02.020 --> 00:11:06.560
allows you to not only explore
within your own medium,

00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:09.967
like for example, the music
I did for this video is

00:11:09.967 --> 00:11:12.300
the kind of music I had been
wanting to make for a while

00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:14.258
actually, but hadn't had
the right opportunity.

00:11:14.258 --> 00:11:17.000
And the clothes presented
the perfect way to do it.

00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:23.350
But also, I think it allows
people to do something that's,

00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:27.090
like, peaceful and neutral
and tasteful and textured.

00:11:27.090 --> 00:11:31.805
And it's really a great
environment to collaborate in.

00:11:31.805 --> 00:11:34.210
JULIE GILHART: What's
the-- both of you

00:11:34.210 --> 00:11:37.990
all should comment--
what's the process?

00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:41.780
Like, do you come
together and say, well,

00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:43.010
what are we going to do?

00:11:43.010 --> 00:11:46.630
Or is it like, I have this
idea, and you expand on it?

00:11:46.630 --> 00:11:49.410
How does that work, or is
it different every time?

00:11:49.410 --> 00:11:52.100
ALIA RAZA: It's been--
we've collaborated together

00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:53.090
three times now.

00:11:53.090 --> 00:11:56.960
We've made three short little
films, or videos together.

00:11:56.960 --> 00:12:01.100
And I think each time started
with a meeting, just talking,

00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:05.010
lunch, whatever-- talking
about what she was working on,

00:12:05.010 --> 00:12:06.530
what I was working on.

00:12:06.530 --> 00:12:09.150
And then me looking
at the clothes

00:12:09.150 --> 00:12:12.070
that she was working on that
she wanted to put in the video.

00:12:12.070 --> 00:12:14.850
And then, just thinking
about the practical stuff,

00:12:14.850 --> 00:12:16.710
like the music and the location.

00:12:16.710 --> 00:12:20.585
And all of that comes
together to-- it's

00:12:20.585 --> 00:12:22.710
not like we're working with
million-dollar budgets,

00:12:22.710 --> 00:12:25.422
so you're not dreaming
up fantasy worlds

00:12:25.422 --> 00:12:26.380
and making them happen.

00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:28.200
You have to work
with what you have.

00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:31.240
So the location, the music,
the clothes, all of it

00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:34.820
comes together to inspire
what you end up with.

00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:36.780
And what you end
up with is usually

00:12:36.780 --> 00:12:40.430
a little bit different from
what the original idea is.

00:12:40.430 --> 00:12:45.150
Like, for the video that we
all just worked on together,

00:12:45.150 --> 00:12:47.400
I had this idea of
spiders in my head.

00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:52.560
And Tess had this kind of giant
crochet piece in her runway

00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:55.850
show, and it kind of
looked like a spider web.

00:12:55.850 --> 00:12:58.960
It just all felt right to me.

00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:03.540
And now when you see the video,
you don't think of a spider.

00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:07.030
There's no spiders in the video.

00:13:07.030 --> 00:13:08.580
The clothes aren't spidery.

00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:12.650
It sounds crazy,
but the idea shifts

00:13:12.650 --> 00:13:14.240
over time, and with each step.

00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:15.405
JULIE GILHART: [INAUDIBLE].

00:13:15.405 --> 00:13:17.040
ALIA RAZA: Yeah.

00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:19.045
It's a fashion
thing, I think, and I

00:13:19.045 --> 00:13:24.400
think if you're making films,
or if you're making art,

00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:26.260
or whatever you're
making, it always

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:27.830
changes during the process.

00:13:27.830 --> 00:13:29.855
It always changes
as you're working.

00:13:29.855 --> 00:13:36.830
JULIE GILHART: It's interesting,
because now-- for the audience,

00:13:36.830 --> 00:13:39.400
I'm working on this very
cool project for [INAUDIBLE]

00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:43.190
and it's the
initiation of a prize.

00:13:43.190 --> 00:13:46.340
And it's for talent
all over the world.

00:13:46.340 --> 00:13:49.530
And it's for really,
really new talent.

00:13:49.530 --> 00:13:54.150
So it's really interesting is
you have access to people that

00:13:54.150 --> 00:13:58.770
are doing things on a
fashion level in places

00:13:58.770 --> 00:14:04.240
like Afghanistan or Nigeria
or just crazy places

00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:09.300
that I would never look, or
you would never have access to.

00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:11.505
But the thing that
I look at the most

00:14:11.505 --> 00:14:15.670
is videos, because
they all have videos.

00:14:15.670 --> 00:14:19.940
And so you're looking at
a picture of girls or men

00:14:19.940 --> 00:14:23.090
in clothing, and you're
reading, and you're

00:14:23.090 --> 00:14:25.530
looking at all their facts--
the age of the designer,

00:14:25.530 --> 00:14:27.321
and how many collections
that they've done.

00:14:27.321 --> 00:14:29.390
But it's really the
video that speaks.

00:14:29.390 --> 00:14:34.170
And then, addressing the
music thing for a show,

00:14:34.170 --> 00:14:37.680
that is so much a
part of the show.

00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:42.680
You could have a great
show with great clothes,

00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:46.150
and if the music isn't
good, it can fall flat.

00:14:46.150 --> 00:14:48.970
And it can actually change
your perception of the clothes.

00:14:48.970 --> 00:14:51.010
It's distracting.

00:14:51.010 --> 00:14:56.926
But the reverse, if you have
great music, it can also--

00:14:56.926 --> 00:14:58.800
CAROLINE POLACHEK: It's
so subconscious, too.

00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:00.522
It totally sneaks
in the back door.

00:15:00.522 --> 00:15:02.480
You're looking at the
clothes, and if the music

00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:04.355
is heavy and hard, you
don't even realize it,

00:15:04.355 --> 00:15:07.410
but you're attributing that
energy to the clothes, too.

00:15:07.410 --> 00:15:09.602
Like, you could show a
piece that's really dainty.

00:15:09.602 --> 00:15:11.060
And if it's paired
with hard music,

00:15:11.060 --> 00:15:12.700
you all of a sudden
imagine it being

00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:15.670
worn in a really specific way.

00:15:15.670 --> 00:15:19.404
I'm kind of new to
working in fashion at all.

00:15:19.404 --> 00:15:21.070
And one thing that I
love that designers

00:15:21.070 --> 00:15:23.600
say when they're designing,
is they talk about their girl.

00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:25.025
Like, who's your
girl this season?

00:15:25.025 --> 00:15:26.650
And at first I didn't
really understand

00:15:26.650 --> 00:15:27.858
what they were talking about.

00:15:27.858 --> 00:15:29.510
But they visualize a person.

00:15:29.510 --> 00:15:30.760
And it's not just the clothes.

00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:32.260
You can visualize
where it's going

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:37.370
to be worn, where she
lives, how old she is,

00:15:37.370 --> 00:15:38.329
what she listens to.

00:15:38.329 --> 00:15:40.370
And I think the fashion
show is the manifestation

00:15:40.370 --> 00:15:42.230
not of just a
collection, but the girl.

00:15:42.230 --> 00:15:44.410
And that plays back into
marketing and branding.

00:15:44.410 --> 00:15:46.999
And that to me is actually
the most interesting aspect

00:15:46.999 --> 00:15:47.790
of the whole thing.

00:15:47.790 --> 00:15:50.880
JULIE GILHART: If you
ever go into a showroom--

00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:52.910
and this happens
at a high level--

00:15:52.910 --> 00:15:55.970
and you have them showing
you the collection,

00:15:55.970 --> 00:16:00.080
they'll call each--
like they'll say "she,"

00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:03.220
she's really going
to be a good seller.

00:16:03.220 --> 00:16:07.447
Or she is perfect,
or she's my favorite.

00:16:07.447 --> 00:16:09.780
ALIA RAZA: Who are they talking
about when you say she--

00:16:09.780 --> 00:16:12.700
JULIE GILHART: They're talking
about garments on a hanger.

00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:17.090
And I just like, I got
to get out of here.

00:16:17.090 --> 00:16:20.510
I just lose it when they
start talking-- when they just

00:16:20.510 --> 00:16:22.990
put this person.

00:16:22.990 --> 00:16:25.460
But this is the "she" thing.

00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:29.290
I never realized that yeah,
they talk about their girl.

00:16:29.290 --> 00:16:31.570
ALIA RAZA: Well, I have to
say that working with Tess,

00:16:31.570 --> 00:16:36.010
she might have a girl in mind
when she does every collection,

00:16:36.010 --> 00:16:40.720
but she's never imposed
that on me or told me,

00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:44.086
this is the kind of girl or the
persona or the characterization

00:16:44.086 --> 00:16:45.490
that you should
put in the video.

00:16:45.490 --> 00:16:49.101
It's never-- she almost
tells me nothing.

00:16:49.101 --> 00:16:50.600
She just lets me
look at the clothes

00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:52.610
and decide who I
want the girl to be.

00:16:52.610 --> 00:16:54.640
And that's a great
thing about working

00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:56.450
with people who
are more interested

00:16:56.450 --> 00:17:01.584
in kind of the collaboration
between different artists,

00:17:01.584 --> 00:17:03.000
rather than, like
you were saying,

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.720
on a purely commercial level
of trying to sell this image,

00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:06.560
or this one girl.

00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:07.935
CAROLINE POLACHEK:
Actually, when

00:17:07.935 --> 00:17:10.270
I met with Tess to discuss
the music for this collection

00:17:10.270 --> 00:17:13.490
for the runway show, there
wasn't any discussion

00:17:13.490 --> 00:17:17.859
of the girl or anything
situational or social at all.

00:17:17.859 --> 00:17:19.990
It was only about line quality.

00:17:19.990 --> 00:17:21.490
She was showing me
Bauhaus drawings.

00:17:21.490 --> 00:17:25.010
She was showing me
photographs from the '60s

00:17:25.010 --> 00:17:27.150
of a girl inside a huge
crochet installation.

00:17:27.150 --> 00:17:29.256
She was showing me the
drawings of the pieces.

00:17:29.256 --> 00:17:30.630
And I went to
school for drawing,

00:17:30.630 --> 00:17:32.070
so this totally
resonated with me.

00:17:32.070 --> 00:17:37.540
And I just instantly heard
string, piano, digital lines,

00:17:37.540 --> 00:17:39.590
acoustic lines,
lines out of tune.

00:17:39.590 --> 00:17:41.700
And that music came right
out of that, and nothing

00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:43.450
to do with-- is she a traveler?

00:17:43.450 --> 00:17:46.150
Is she young?

00:17:46.150 --> 00:17:47.650
What does she do?

00:17:47.650 --> 00:17:51.440
It was just very formal and
very abstract, and I loved that.

00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:54.610
TESS GIBERSON: And I can work
that way because of the people

00:17:54.610 --> 00:17:57.570
I choose to collaborate with.

00:17:57.570 --> 00:17:59.690
I'm very picky
about who I choose.

00:17:59.690 --> 00:18:02.210
And it's always, there
has to be the respect,

00:18:02.210 --> 00:18:03.380
and I like their work.

00:18:03.380 --> 00:18:05.700
And then I know it's--
like I was saying before,

00:18:05.700 --> 00:18:08.520
then I can have that trust
that it's going to be OK.

00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:10.890
And I don't have to say,
this is how it has to be.

00:18:10.890 --> 00:18:12.890
And I think that's what
a good collaboration is,

00:18:12.890 --> 00:18:14.630
is where you can let go.

00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:16.719
Like for me, I come
with, I have the idea

00:18:16.719 --> 00:18:18.010
and I know what my clothes are.

00:18:18.010 --> 00:18:21.535
But I don't-- I can't tell
you what the video should look

00:18:21.535 --> 00:18:22.910
like, because I'm
not a director.

00:18:22.910 --> 00:18:25.420
And I can't tell you what
the music should sound like.

00:18:25.420 --> 00:18:26.230
I don't make music.

00:18:26.230 --> 00:18:28.050
And I think it gets
tricky when you

00:18:28.050 --> 00:18:32.290
try-- when someone who-- if a
designer tries to direct when

00:18:32.290 --> 00:18:34.600
they're not a director, you
don't get the right result.

00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:38.090
But if I can just let
it go, and really trust,

00:18:38.090 --> 00:18:39.090
and then it's exciting.

00:18:39.090 --> 00:18:41.950
I love not knowing
what it will look like,

00:18:41.950 --> 00:18:47.530
and then it's a really cool
surprise to see the end result.

00:18:47.530 --> 00:18:50.300
JULIE GILHART: It's
interesting because I think--

00:18:50.300 --> 00:18:54.470
I've seen so many
designers when they start

00:18:54.470 --> 00:18:56.730
in the business of
fashion, pre-collections

00:18:56.730 --> 00:18:59.460
have become so important.

00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:02.720
Those collections that are
before the runway, that

00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:04.100
come into the stores early.

00:19:04.100 --> 00:19:10.470
And that's actually where
you can address the more

00:19:10.470 --> 00:19:14.360
day-to-day needs, rather than
the fantasy needs, in a way.

00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:17.760
But it's interesting,
because usually when

00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:21.150
a show comes around,
collaborators come in.

00:19:21.150 --> 00:19:24.210
And what the designer told me
the show was going to be about

00:19:24.210 --> 00:19:28.920
is never what they say.

00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:32.540
And I think it's because
of the collaborators.

00:19:32.540 --> 00:19:33.789
ALIA RAZA: Do you like that?

00:19:33.789 --> 00:19:35.830
Do you like seeing a new
angle on it, or do you--

00:19:35.830 --> 00:19:36.663
JULIE GILHART: Yeah.

00:19:36.663 --> 00:19:39.870
I mean, I like for people
to be spontaneous and not

00:19:39.870 --> 00:19:41.990
get stuck, and have to do that.

00:19:41.990 --> 00:19:44.850
You have to be open,
but that probably

00:19:44.850 --> 00:19:46.830
happens in your
process, like one idea

00:19:46.830 --> 00:19:51.010
you have because you talked to
her, and you all start to talk,

00:19:51.010 --> 00:19:52.970
it sort of morphs
into something else,

00:19:52.970 --> 00:19:56.230
which really enhances
the creative thing.

00:19:56.230 --> 00:19:59.190
And it gets you away from
the business of fashion,

00:19:59.190 --> 00:20:03.320
and the trends, and feeling all
these subliminal messages that

00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:05.429
come in that you feel
like, I have to do that.

00:20:05.429 --> 00:20:07.970
TESS GIBERSON: And that's what's
so important about coming up

00:20:07.970 --> 00:20:11.980
with new ideas and actually
finding new designs that

00:20:11.980 --> 00:20:13.310
come from yourself.

00:20:13.310 --> 00:20:15.630
I think that's what
collaborations really

00:20:15.630 --> 00:20:20.080
give me, is they continue
to give me that creativity.

00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:23.890
Otherwise, it's too
easy to get stuck

00:20:23.890 --> 00:20:27.050
into the deadlines,
the deliveries.

00:20:27.050 --> 00:20:30.270
That's all part of the business.

00:20:30.270 --> 00:20:33.250
And I like that part
separately, but I also

00:20:33.250 --> 00:20:36.450
know I need the creative
energy to come in.

00:20:36.450 --> 00:20:38.560
And I get that through
the collaborations.

00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:40.520
JULIE GILHART: So
it's also interesting,

00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:49.750
because how do you tell people
about you, in terms of, like,

00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:55.713
you don't advertise, and you
don't have a big publicist.

00:21:00.970 --> 00:21:04.710
But yet, people-- how
are you communicating

00:21:04.710 --> 00:21:06.620
some of these
things that you do?

00:21:06.620 --> 00:21:08.810
And I'm saying
that in the context

00:21:08.810 --> 00:21:14.270
of being at Barney's
when we first started.

00:21:14.270 --> 00:21:16.660
And you'd have to
put it practically

00:21:16.660 --> 00:21:18.310
when people got off
the escalator so

00:21:18.310 --> 00:21:20.060
that they would see it.

00:21:20.060 --> 00:21:23.140
And then you'd have to talk
to the salespeople a lot.

00:21:23.140 --> 00:21:25.720
And then you have to
try and see if you

00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:28.300
can put it in the catalog.

00:21:28.300 --> 00:21:31.090
And so it was very basic now.

00:21:31.090 --> 00:21:34.620
And now we have all the social
media and visual things.

00:21:34.620 --> 00:21:38.699
So one has to choose
how they do that.

00:21:38.699 --> 00:21:40.490
And that's also now
I'm seeing a reflection

00:21:40.490 --> 00:21:43.190
of how you are as a brand, too.

00:21:43.190 --> 00:21:45.062
TESS GIBERSON: We've
actually-- social media

00:21:45.062 --> 00:21:46.520
has been great for
us, because it's

00:21:46.520 --> 00:21:49.740
a way for us to directly
tell the story of what

00:21:49.740 --> 00:21:54.570
the collection is, who I
am, the project I'm doing.

00:21:54.570 --> 00:21:59.310
It's a direct
connection to customers,

00:21:59.310 --> 00:22:00.580
anyone who's interested.

00:22:00.580 --> 00:22:03.560
It's just like, it
reaches out directly.

00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:07.230
We still work through PR,
working with magazines,

00:22:07.230 --> 00:22:10.734
working online, and
also just publications.

00:22:10.734 --> 00:22:11.900
JULIE GILHART: Traditional--

00:22:11.900 --> 00:22:13.024
TESS GIBERSON: Traditional.

00:22:13.024 --> 00:22:14.080
So I do both.

00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:16.850
But the last two
years, we've really

00:22:16.850 --> 00:22:18.480
embraced the social
media in just

00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:20.960
being able to tell
our own story.

00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:23.150
And that's been really exciting.

00:22:23.150 --> 00:22:25.880
And it's just, for a
brand, for our brand

00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:27.940
it's also through
direct relationship

00:22:27.940 --> 00:22:30.500
with the customers--
going to the store,

00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:33.000
working with customers,
meeting customers.

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:36.720
And when people wear the
clothes, they become fans.

00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:40.500
And it's really been this
just growing word of mouth,

00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:43.870
and directly
working with people.

00:22:43.870 --> 00:22:44.702
And they get it.

00:22:44.702 --> 00:22:46.410
When they put the
clothes on, they really

00:22:46.410 --> 00:22:47.489
get what it's about.

00:22:47.489 --> 00:22:48.780
They get what I'm trying to do.

00:22:48.780 --> 00:22:50.510
And I don't have
to say anything.

00:22:50.510 --> 00:22:52.780
They tell me how they
feel about the clothes.

00:22:52.780 --> 00:22:54.750
And that's been so
exciting to see.

00:22:59.370 --> 00:23:00.940
JULIE GILHART: I
can't help but think

00:23:00.940 --> 00:23:03.550
that that's going to be really
important for the future,

00:23:03.550 --> 00:23:07.050
that because you see
all these mass brands,

00:23:07.050 --> 00:23:12.130
and they're communicated a
lot, and they sell a lot.

00:23:12.130 --> 00:23:14.170
I don't know, how do
you all feel about that?

00:23:14.170 --> 00:23:17.350
I mean, I'm more
attracted to something--

00:23:17.350 --> 00:23:19.120
and today people say "luxury."

00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:21.450
But luxury to me
is something now

00:23:21.450 --> 00:23:23.660
that's not so easily accessible.

00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:26.665
CAROLINE POLACHEK: Well, I
think that actually-- maybe this

00:23:26.665 --> 00:23:28.790
is a little bit grim-- but
I do see it as a luxury,

00:23:28.790 --> 00:23:29.831
especially in the future.

00:23:29.831 --> 00:23:32.060
Because now that
so much production

00:23:32.060 --> 00:23:36.360
is outsourced and expected to
happen at very cheap prices,

00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:38.360
our idea of how much we
need to pay for a shirt,

00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:40.485
and with the quality of
what we're going to expect,

00:23:40.485 --> 00:23:41.340
has gotten very low.

00:23:41.340 --> 00:23:46.300
Like maybe a girl who's like
25 thinks the average price

00:23:46.300 --> 00:23:48.230
you should expect to pay
for a shirt is, like,

00:23:48.230 --> 00:23:49.999
between $30 and
$50 or something.

00:23:49.999 --> 00:23:51.790
But in order to make
something really well,

00:23:51.790 --> 00:23:53.789
in order to source
nice fabrics--

00:23:53.789 --> 00:23:56.330
you're not even doing something
fancy, like you said earlier.

00:23:56.330 --> 00:23:58.871
Just something that you can wear
every day that will last you

00:23:58.871 --> 00:24:01.120
for years, that's going
to look beautiful on you.

00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:03.920
To do something well costs a lot
more than that, and especially

00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:08.380
if you're working on
a small batch sizes.

00:24:08.380 --> 00:24:10.640
And I think it's almost
similar to the model

00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:13.960
for organic small farms
going into the future.

00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:18.800
You can't compete with, like,
Monsanto-grown corn seed.

00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:23.650
It, for better or for worse,
is a certain kind of luxury.

00:24:23.650 --> 00:24:25.750
ALIA RAZA: And why
would you want to?

00:24:25.750 --> 00:24:28.600
I feel like I don't
think Tess wants

00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:31.160
to be making fast
fashion, and selling--

00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:32.080
CAROLINE POLACHEK:
[INAUDIBLE] money but you

00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:33.340
can't compete with those prices.

00:24:33.340 --> 00:24:34.166
ALIA RAZA: Oh, yeah.

00:24:34.166 --> 00:24:34.666
True.

00:24:34.666 --> 00:24:36.590
JULIE GILHART: I
think it's a decision

00:24:36.590 --> 00:24:41.390
if you want to be really big,
or if you just want to be big.

00:24:41.390 --> 00:24:45.310
I think that we have
a-- fashion has this,

00:24:45.310 --> 00:24:51.150
you just have to be-- to be
valid, you have to be huge.

00:24:51.150 --> 00:24:51.650
And--

00:24:51.650 --> 00:24:53.520
ALIA RAZA: Everybody has to know
who you are, and you have to--

00:24:53.520 --> 00:24:54.680
JULIE GILHART: Yeah.

00:24:54.680 --> 00:24:58.130
But I will tell you with
every single brand, that

00:24:58.130 --> 00:25:02.570
goes into that direction, it
does lose that connection,

00:25:02.570 --> 00:25:04.240
that personal connection.

00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:06.000
There's always a
brand connection,

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:08.550
but I think the kind
of thing that you

00:25:08.550 --> 00:25:12.040
stand for, very
intimate collaborations.

00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:13.360
And you have a platform.

00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:15.360
Like you were saying,
you have social media.

00:25:15.360 --> 00:25:17.560
You can tell them exactly
what you're doing,

00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:20.930
and that's going to be
interesting, I think.

00:25:20.930 --> 00:25:24.380
TESS GIBERSON: And we do want
to be big, but with integrity.

00:25:24.380 --> 00:25:25.220
Don't get me wrong.

00:25:25.220 --> 00:25:28.330
We are very aggressive,
and we do want to grow,

00:25:28.330 --> 00:25:30.440
but we want to do it
always with integrity,

00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:33.370
always aligning ourselves with
projects that we believe in.

00:25:33.370 --> 00:25:35.680
We have, like, with
my partners we all

00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:38.270
have very core values
that we agree on.

00:25:38.270 --> 00:25:40.990
And so as we're growing
and we're always

00:25:40.990 --> 00:25:43.430
talking about where we're
going with the company,

00:25:43.430 --> 00:25:45.660
it's about maintaining
the integrity,

00:25:45.660 --> 00:25:48.560
maintaining what the
collection's about,

00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:50.240
what the feeling is about.

00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:51.750
And it's about
connecting directly

00:25:51.750 --> 00:25:54.280
with the women who are
wearing the clothes.

00:25:54.280 --> 00:25:56.625
Eventually, we want to do
men's, but right now it's

00:25:56.625 --> 00:25:57.250
just the women.

00:25:57.250 --> 00:26:00.550
So we're excited to
do that in the future.

00:26:00.550 --> 00:26:05.350
But it's really making sure that
everything that we're making,

00:26:05.350 --> 00:26:07.510
we believe in, we
would wear, we want

00:26:07.510 --> 00:26:09.181
to see other people wearing.

00:26:09.181 --> 00:26:10.930
There's a lot of thought
and consideration

00:26:10.930 --> 00:26:12.030
that goes into it.

00:26:12.030 --> 00:26:15.670
And I believe as we grow
we can maintain that,

00:26:15.670 --> 00:26:17.540
as long as that's
always important to us.

00:26:17.540 --> 00:26:19.839
JULIE GILHART: Do you
ever thing about Calvin?

00:26:19.839 --> 00:26:21.130
TESS GIBERSON: How do you mean?

00:26:21.130 --> 00:26:23.588
JULIE GILHART: Do you just ever
think about how he started,

00:26:23.588 --> 00:26:27.360
and how his business grew, and--

00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:29.190
TESS GIBERSON: Yeah, definitely.

00:26:29.190 --> 00:26:30.720
That's an amazing story.

00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:34.080
And I have a lot of respect,
so much respect for the way

00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:36.180
that he built his company.

00:26:36.180 --> 00:26:40.370
And that was a great
experience working there.

00:26:40.370 --> 00:26:42.570
It was such a good
foundation for me.

00:26:42.570 --> 00:26:44.880
And I love how
systematic, how clear,

00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:47.610
the marketing was brilliant.

00:26:47.610 --> 00:26:50.790
You knew when you walked
in where you were.

00:26:50.790 --> 00:26:55.490
And it was so thorough,
and I loved that.

00:26:55.490 --> 00:26:58.300
I loved that then and I still
love that way of doing things.

00:26:58.300 --> 00:27:01.820
And it really had a
huge impact on me,

00:27:01.820 --> 00:27:03.720
even though I after
wanted to do something

00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:06.550
super, super personal.

00:27:06.550 --> 00:27:10.680
Things I learned at Calvin, I
still work in that same way.

00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:14.870
There's some things I
just learned structurally

00:27:14.870 --> 00:27:18.350
that I still use when I'm
working-- the way I organize.

00:27:21.937 --> 00:27:25.260
JULIE GILHART: Well,
we're going to have

00:27:25.260 --> 00:27:29.790
to continue this
conversation off-camera.

00:27:29.790 --> 00:27:35.360
But I think it's really,
really, really, really exciting.

00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:37.730
Really exciting.

00:27:37.730 --> 00:27:41.760
I think it's the most
exciting part of fashion.

00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:46.760
I have to say this one thing,
because I was in the fashion

00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:52.350
arena when they-- referring back
to the Antwerp Six, Margiela,

00:27:52.350 --> 00:27:55.330
Dries Van Noten,
Ann Demeulemeester.

00:27:55.330 --> 00:28:00.190
And they have those
same principles.

00:28:00.190 --> 00:28:04.030
And believe it or not, it
was like over 25 years ago.

00:28:04.030 --> 00:28:09.580
But they really-- and so
I think you, all of you

00:28:09.580 --> 00:28:11.442
all have like a
really bright future.

00:28:11.442 --> 00:28:12.900
ALIA RAZA: Those
were the designers

00:28:12.900 --> 00:28:14.830
that, when I was
a teenager, I used

00:28:14.830 --> 00:28:18.510
to pay attention to, and wish
I could buy those clothes,

00:28:18.510 --> 00:28:21.290
and save up money
for those clothes,

00:28:21.290 --> 00:28:28.530
and Margiela and [INAUDIBLE]
and Demeulemeester.

00:28:28.530 --> 00:28:32.687
So it makes sense
that you said that.

00:28:32.687 --> 00:28:34.020
JULIE GILHART: So thank you all.

00:28:34.020 --> 00:28:35.130
ALIA RAZA: Thank you.

00:28:35.130 --> 00:28:40.900
MALE SPEAKER: Thank you,
Julie, Tess, Alia and Caroline.

00:28:40.900 --> 00:28:45.760
We're going to now show Tess'
video for her spring, summer

00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:47.230
2014 collection.

00:28:47.230 --> 00:28:51.040
And then we're going to go into
10 minutes of Q&amp;A. If anyone

00:28:51.040 --> 00:28:53.270
has any questions,
there's two mics.

00:28:53.270 --> 00:28:55.330
You can line up,
and after the video

00:28:55.330 --> 00:28:58.290
you can ask these folks any
questions that you may have.

00:28:58.290 --> 00:30:55.281
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:30:55.281 --> 00:31:01.190
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:31:01.190 --> 00:31:04.740
AUDIENCE: Hi, I have a
question for you guys.

00:31:04.740 --> 00:31:05.630
My name is Michael.

00:31:05.630 --> 00:31:08.506
I work here on the sales
side of the organization.

00:31:08.506 --> 00:31:10.630
And I don't know why I
introduced myself like that,

00:31:10.630 --> 00:31:12.770
because it has no
pertinence to my question.

00:31:12.770 --> 00:31:16.400
But I guess I would just love
to hear all of your takes

00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:21.740
on-- I think one of the things
I took away from your guys

00:31:21.740 --> 00:31:24.180
speaking about, sort
of, your philosophy

00:31:24.180 --> 00:31:28.770
and how you think
about collaborating,

00:31:28.770 --> 00:31:33.100
is maybe the idea that you want
people to come to your store

00:31:33.100 --> 00:31:37.110
or fashion or even
your video, and be

00:31:37.110 --> 00:31:39.490
able to express
themselves through sort

00:31:39.490 --> 00:31:43.470
of the blank canvas of your
style and of your fashion.

00:31:43.470 --> 00:31:49.720
And when I think about the
brands from yesteryear,

00:31:49.720 --> 00:31:52.860
all the big fashion brands
that you guys were also

00:31:52.860 --> 00:31:55.450
talking about, I think
there's something more

00:31:55.450 --> 00:31:59.070
about them wanting to gift
you with their perspective,

00:31:59.070 --> 00:32:04.310
or their brand, or their
personality, or the her, right?

00:32:04.310 --> 00:32:05.600
They want to give you the her.

00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:08.990
They want to make you the her,
by you exchanging with them

00:32:08.990 --> 00:32:10.210
and interacting with them.

00:32:10.210 --> 00:32:12.770
So I was wondering your
thoughts on that idea

00:32:12.770 --> 00:32:16.670
of the thirst for
self-discovery,

00:32:16.670 --> 00:32:18.520
even in the things
that we purchase.

00:32:18.520 --> 00:32:22.700
And not to be defined by
them, but to define ourselves

00:32:22.700 --> 00:32:25.700
in that process, and
maybe how you think about

00:32:25.700 --> 00:32:29.070
that in regards to your art,
and if that's sort of on point

00:32:29.070 --> 00:32:31.084
or not.

00:32:31.084 --> 00:32:33.480
TESS GIBERSON: What
I am always thinking

00:32:33.480 --> 00:32:35.920
about when I'm designing,
I want the clothes

00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:38.204
to become part of the
woman who's buying them.

00:32:38.204 --> 00:32:39.620
The woman who wears
the clothes, I

00:32:39.620 --> 00:32:44.370
want-- it's about bringing
her own personality out, not

00:32:44.370 --> 00:32:47.390
putting on to her anything else.

00:32:47.390 --> 00:32:50.290
But it's just like, when
I think about the clothes,

00:32:50.290 --> 00:32:53.180
it's about feeling
comfortable, confident,

00:32:53.180 --> 00:32:55.640
just bringing out your
own inner confidence.

00:32:55.640 --> 00:32:56.650
It's always about that.

00:32:56.650 --> 00:32:58.750
And to mix it however
the woman wants to,

00:32:58.750 --> 00:33:01.250
wear it however she wants to.

00:33:01.250 --> 00:33:04.690
That's a very big part
of actually how I design.

00:33:04.690 --> 00:33:08.080
And I think it's not
putting something onto them,

00:33:08.080 --> 00:33:12.740
but just bringing out
the strength inside.

00:33:12.740 --> 00:33:16.330
And it can be really subtle,
but it's always there.

00:33:16.330 --> 00:33:18.100
It's always something
I'm thinking about.

00:33:18.100 --> 00:33:19.090
And I love-- I see it.

00:33:19.090 --> 00:33:21.264
I see when the women
wear the clothes, that's

00:33:21.264 --> 00:33:22.680
actually something
that comes out.

00:33:22.680 --> 00:33:26.670
Because everything I do,
it's about feeling it's easy,

00:33:26.670 --> 00:33:28.860
it's comfortable, it's cool.

00:33:28.860 --> 00:33:32.920
And it's just about having
this inner confidence.

00:33:32.920 --> 00:33:34.810
CAROLINE POLACHEK:
Tess loaned me

00:33:34.810 --> 00:33:37.605
a couple looks on Trail
of Summer tour, one

00:33:37.605 --> 00:33:39.730
of which I found myself
going back to all the time.

00:33:39.730 --> 00:33:41.938
And not even just for stage,
but just for everything.

00:33:41.938 --> 00:33:44.316
And on the rack, it
looks like a white shirt

00:33:44.316 --> 00:33:45.940
with a bunch of
strings hanging off it,

00:33:45.940 --> 00:33:48.080
and a white skirt with a bunch
of strings hanging off it.

00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:48.880
And that's it.

00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:52.020
But when you put it
on, it's-- I mean,

00:33:52.020 --> 00:33:55.606
I know this kind of
idea of modular play,

00:33:55.606 --> 00:33:56.980
because it's in
a lot of things--

00:33:56.980 --> 00:34:00.260
in our actual websites
and furniture now.

00:34:00.260 --> 00:34:02.537
But it really
transformed characters.

00:34:02.537 --> 00:34:04.370
If I'd tie it one way
or tie it another way,

00:34:04.370 --> 00:34:07.370
it could look angelic
and straitjackety

00:34:07.370 --> 00:34:10.360
from one minute to another.

00:34:10.360 --> 00:34:12.326
And even leaving the
strings all hanging off

00:34:12.326 --> 00:34:14.659
was amazing for me, because
I play synthesizer on stage.

00:34:14.659 --> 00:34:16.242
And that is the most
boring instrument

00:34:16.242 --> 00:34:18.368
to watch anyone play in
the history of instruments.

00:34:18.368 --> 00:34:19.950
It's a person standing
at a rectangle.

00:34:19.950 --> 00:34:20.469
Great.

00:34:20.469 --> 00:34:22.870
But if I have a bunch of
strings hanging off me,

00:34:22.870 --> 00:34:25.429
every one of my emotions--
if I hit a chord,

00:34:25.429 --> 00:34:27.670
you see it translate [BRRRAHH]
into the entire thing

00:34:27.670 --> 00:34:28.580
I'm wearing.

00:34:28.580 --> 00:34:29.989
And that was really
exciting too.

00:34:29.989 --> 00:34:32.090
But ultimately, I could have
kind of laced it up nicely

00:34:32.090 --> 00:34:33.048
and gone out to dinner.

00:34:33.048 --> 00:34:37.400
And I think that kind of
sensitivity to the wearer

00:34:37.400 --> 00:34:39.810
is kind of what
Tess specializes in.

00:34:42.792 --> 00:34:45.033
ALIA RAZA: I completely
agree with you.

00:34:45.033 --> 00:34:47.199
From all the clothes that
I have that Tess has made,

00:34:47.199 --> 00:34:48.032
I feel the same way.

00:34:48.032 --> 00:34:51.940
You can wear them in-- sometimes
you wear them in multiple ways

00:34:51.940 --> 00:34:54.139
and totally make them your own.

00:34:54.139 --> 00:34:56.590
In terms of my own
work, I don't think

00:34:56.590 --> 00:35:01.320
that I've thought much
about-- I mean making art,

00:35:01.320 --> 00:35:03.790
whether it's video art
or art objects-- I never

00:35:03.790 --> 00:35:07.150
think about how somebody's
going to make it their own.

00:35:07.150 --> 00:35:09.650
I'm just trying to
kind of impose my view,

00:35:09.650 --> 00:35:14.160
and give somebody an experience.

00:35:14.160 --> 00:35:18.950
But I've recently started
making perfume as well.

00:35:18.950 --> 00:35:23.590
And I think that's similar
to clothing, in that people

00:35:23.590 --> 00:35:25.480
wear perfume to
make it their own.

00:35:25.480 --> 00:35:27.860
They don't wear it--
people aren't really

00:35:27.860 --> 00:35:30.170
interested in
fragrance and scent

00:35:30.170 --> 00:35:33.800
as something that's
imposed on them.

00:35:33.800 --> 00:35:35.730
They want it to
become part of them.

00:35:35.730 --> 00:35:38.300
So it's like a whole
new thing to do.

00:35:49.754 --> 00:35:52.460
AUDIENCE: You spoke a little
bit about pre-collections,

00:35:52.460 --> 00:35:56.420
and the role of having a
pre-collection that translates

00:35:56.420 --> 00:36:01.820
into a full line, fall
or spring collection.

00:36:01.820 --> 00:36:05.110
Tess, when you start designing
for one of your main seasons,

00:36:05.110 --> 00:36:06.900
where do you start?

00:36:06.900 --> 00:36:10.335
Like, what's step one
in your design process?

00:36:10.335 --> 00:36:12.890
TESS GIBERSON: I
always start, actually

00:36:12.890 --> 00:36:15.450
with a conversation
with my husband.

00:36:15.450 --> 00:36:20.440
We've-- honestly, since college,
we've been collaborating

00:36:20.440 --> 00:36:23.470
on just the ideas with
our work together.

00:36:23.470 --> 00:36:25.000
I talk to him about
his paintings,

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:27.000
and he talks to me
about my collections.

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:27.720
And we just talk.

00:36:27.720 --> 00:36:29.450
And it's through
talking and we kind of

00:36:29.450 --> 00:36:32.550
think about different
ideas, what we could do.

00:36:32.550 --> 00:36:34.850
So with the collections--
and I did this

00:36:34.850 --> 00:36:38.810
with my original collection--
and even when I worked at TSE,

00:36:38.810 --> 00:36:40.200
I worked this way.

00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:43.090
And now it's just like talking,
and kind of brainstorming

00:36:43.090 --> 00:36:46.510
what it could be, what
would be a fun collection

00:36:46.510 --> 00:36:47.240
to build off of?

00:36:47.240 --> 00:36:48.380
And what would the show be?

00:36:48.380 --> 00:36:51.630
And I think about
what the show might

00:36:51.630 --> 00:36:53.700
be when I'm starting
the collection.

00:36:53.700 --> 00:36:58.250
And then I usually start with
a word, an idea, a thought.

00:36:58.250 --> 00:37:00.330
And I take that and
I just brainstorm

00:37:00.330 --> 00:37:04.390
words from that, and
then ideas of what it

00:37:04.390 --> 00:37:07.170
could be in clothing,
and how can I bring those

00:37:07.170 --> 00:37:10.697
into details in the clothing,
and how could I build up

00:37:10.697 --> 00:37:12.280
a whole collection
around it, and then

00:37:12.280 --> 00:37:15.830
what would the show be,
the music, the feeling?

00:37:15.830 --> 00:37:17.510
So it's just a lot of words.

00:37:17.510 --> 00:37:22.770
And I kind of build trees off
of words, and that's my process.

00:37:22.770 --> 00:37:25.330
And I think I just,
sometimes I make it more

00:37:25.330 --> 00:37:27.080
elaborate than I need to.

00:37:27.080 --> 00:37:30.030
Because really, when it comes
down to it, it's a formula.

00:37:30.030 --> 00:37:33.680
You kind of know what your plan
is, you know what you need.

00:37:33.680 --> 00:37:36.030
But for me creatively
to maintain

00:37:36.030 --> 00:37:38.200
my love of what
I'm doing, I need

00:37:38.200 --> 00:37:43.430
to work like that, because
it's how I discover new--

00:37:43.430 --> 00:37:45.620
how do I come up with a
new shirt every season?

00:37:45.620 --> 00:37:48.620
I have to push myself
a little bit more.

00:37:48.620 --> 00:37:50.385
And it's fun.

00:37:50.385 --> 00:37:51.760
CAROLINE POLACHEK:
That makes you

00:37:51.760 --> 00:37:54.290
think about what Alia was
saying about spiders being

00:37:54.290 --> 00:37:56.280
a reference for her video.

00:37:56.280 --> 00:37:58.090
Because by the time
I saw the video,

00:37:58.090 --> 00:37:59.810
it was pretty close
to being completed.

00:37:59.810 --> 00:38:01.580
And I did not see
anything spidery in it,

00:38:01.580 --> 00:38:03.830
nor did I hear anything
spidery in the soundtrack.

00:38:03.830 --> 00:38:08.090
ALIA RAZA: But I asked you to do
something spidery, and you did.

00:38:08.090 --> 00:38:11.750
And then it kind of shifted
and turned into something else,

00:38:11.750 --> 00:38:13.270
but it-- go ahead.

00:38:13.270 --> 00:38:13.730
CAROLINE POLACHEK:
Well, what I mean

00:38:13.730 --> 00:38:15.510
is there's a process
of distillation.

00:38:15.510 --> 00:38:16.560
Like you were talking
about word trees.

00:38:16.560 --> 00:38:19.100
And I think often, when you're
chewing on the same idea

00:38:19.100 --> 00:38:21.160
and elaborating on it,
and trying to interpret it

00:38:21.160 --> 00:38:23.860
across so many different
kinds of media,

00:38:23.860 --> 00:38:27.044
you suddenly realize that
it's not the spider itself

00:38:27.044 --> 00:38:28.210
that you were interested in.

00:38:28.210 --> 00:38:31.350
Maybe it's the energy
of a way a spider moves,

00:38:31.350 --> 00:38:33.640
or it's that idea
of angles, or it's

00:38:33.640 --> 00:38:35.950
that idea of a thing
disseminating [INAUDIBLE] web.

00:38:35.950 --> 00:38:38.850
Or the kind of quiet
predator aspect of it.

00:38:38.850 --> 00:38:41.610
You find that there's like
a thing, a quality to it.

00:38:41.610 --> 00:38:43.080
And you could scrap
the spider idea

00:38:43.080 --> 00:38:44.640
and just go for that energy.

00:38:44.640 --> 00:38:47.330
And I feel like
that's what you're

00:38:47.330 --> 00:38:49.400
talking about when you're
going for the expanding

00:38:49.400 --> 00:38:50.810
from a single word.

00:38:50.810 --> 00:38:52.310
ALIA RAZA: And
that's what happened,

00:38:52.310 --> 00:38:54.930
because it went from-- I
think when you said, what

00:38:54.930 --> 00:38:56.480
are you thinking for the music,
and I said, I don't know,

00:38:56.480 --> 00:38:57.080
a spider.

00:38:57.080 --> 00:38:58.350
And you were like, OK.

00:38:58.350 --> 00:39:03.210
And then it turned into
kind of like more alien girl

00:39:03.210 --> 00:39:07.870
who crash landed onto a rooftop
in Brooklyn in the Apocalypse.

00:39:07.870 --> 00:39:10.850
And all of that is
very subtle, but that's

00:39:10.850 --> 00:39:13.150
what I was thinking of
when we were shooting it.

00:39:13.150 --> 00:39:13.650
Yeah.

00:39:13.650 --> 00:39:14.150
It switched.

00:39:19.060 --> 00:39:22.270
CAROLINE POLACHEK: Don't be shy.

00:39:22.270 --> 00:39:24.110
ALIA RAZA: Ryan?

00:39:24.110 --> 00:39:25.802
Question?

00:39:25.802 --> 00:39:27.510
AUDIENCE: I just had
a question, in terms

00:39:27.510 --> 00:39:33.110
of how do you see your own
fashions evolving from what you

00:39:33.110 --> 00:39:34.760
were, say, 10 years back to now.

00:39:34.760 --> 00:39:36.460
Like, what's the
difference, even

00:39:36.460 --> 00:39:37.920
in terms of-- even your art.

00:39:37.920 --> 00:39:39.642
When you do
something, what do you

00:39:39.642 --> 00:39:42.150
compose maybe five years
back or two years back?

00:39:42.150 --> 00:39:43.270
How has it changed?

00:39:43.270 --> 00:39:45.311
And what do you feel are
some of the factors that

00:39:45.311 --> 00:39:48.355
contribute to this change?

00:39:48.355 --> 00:39:50.670
TESS GIBERSON: The
biggest change for me is,

00:39:50.670 --> 00:39:53.790
I always, originally I
felt this compulsion.

00:39:53.790 --> 00:39:55.380
I had to make it myself.

00:39:55.380 --> 00:39:58.870
And it was just like
crazy, very obsessive,

00:39:58.870 --> 00:40:03.050
like I had to put my hand on do
every single thing I produced,

00:40:03.050 --> 00:40:05.940
which was great in
the first two years

00:40:05.940 --> 00:40:08.650
when I was doing limited
edition-- was like smaller

00:40:08.650 --> 00:40:09.720
productions.

00:40:09.720 --> 00:40:14.876
Once I started producing,
selling more and more

00:40:14.876 --> 00:40:16.250
and the collections
were growing,

00:40:16.250 --> 00:40:17.230
there became a problem.

00:40:17.230 --> 00:40:22.820
Because it was like
physically killing me.

00:40:22.820 --> 00:40:24.970
And then I had my first child.

00:40:24.970 --> 00:40:27.342
And at that point I
realized, this is crazy.

00:40:27.342 --> 00:40:29.050
And I have to change
the way I'm working,

00:40:29.050 --> 00:40:31.490
because I can't keep
working this way.

00:40:31.490 --> 00:40:35.420
I mean I would literally
be working 16-hour days.

00:40:35.420 --> 00:40:39.460
And my husband has
his painting studio.

00:40:39.460 --> 00:40:40.390
We had a big loft.

00:40:40.390 --> 00:40:41.700
He painted one side.

00:40:41.700 --> 00:40:44.050
I had my sewing machines
on the other side.

00:40:44.050 --> 00:40:45.630
And we both just would work.

00:40:45.630 --> 00:40:47.060
Then when we had
our first child,

00:40:47.060 --> 00:40:50.020
we realized we
can't work this way.

00:40:50.020 --> 00:40:53.350
And so it was at that point
I was able to step back.

00:40:53.350 --> 00:40:55.630
And I took a few years,
I worked for TSE.

00:40:55.630 --> 00:40:58.454
And then when I restarted,
I knew the essence

00:40:58.454 --> 00:40:59.870
of what I wanted
to keep, and that

00:40:59.870 --> 00:41:04.590
was having integrity,
having the creative ideas,

00:41:04.590 --> 00:41:07.581
it was of the approach that
could keep the creativity,

00:41:07.581 --> 00:41:08.706
keeping the collaborations.

00:41:11.500 --> 00:41:13.910
So there was a spirit
that was maintained.

00:41:13.910 --> 00:41:16.940
But I knew I didn't have
to make it any more myself.

00:41:16.940 --> 00:41:20.429
Wasn't about me making the
patterns, sewing the pieces,

00:41:20.429 --> 00:41:21.470
doing the hand stitching.

00:41:21.470 --> 00:41:24.390
I could step back and
give more direction,

00:41:24.390 --> 00:41:26.480
and tell other
people what I wanted,

00:41:26.480 --> 00:41:28.270
what I wanted it to look like.

00:41:28.270 --> 00:41:30.170
And actually, I could
be a lot more precise.

00:41:30.170 --> 00:41:34.940
And I could get more
of what I wanted,

00:41:34.940 --> 00:41:36.920
because I wasn't
making it myself.

00:41:36.920 --> 00:41:39.890
And that was a really
exciting and liberating point

00:41:39.890 --> 00:41:40.880
that I got to.

00:41:40.880 --> 00:41:44.130
So now, I can go through
the creative process,

00:41:44.130 --> 00:41:47.970
but I don't have to be-- it's
not as physically exhausting.

00:41:47.970 --> 00:41:51.830
And it's a lot more fun
that it was towards the end.

00:41:57.966 --> 00:42:00.400
JULIE GILHART: Did
you have a question?

00:42:00.400 --> 00:42:01.105
OK, go ahead.

00:42:01.105 --> 00:42:02.813
AUDIENCE: Also, maybe
a selfish question.

00:42:02.813 --> 00:42:04.280
But you mentioned menswear.

00:42:04.280 --> 00:42:05.585
I'm just curious.

00:42:05.585 --> 00:42:07.460
I think there are
definitely some test givers

00:42:07.460 --> 00:42:09.160
and pieces that
I would wear now.

00:42:09.160 --> 00:42:14.032
But I'm curious how your designs
could translate to menswear.

00:42:14.032 --> 00:42:17.196
TESS GIBERSON: There's so many
pieces that I think already

00:42:17.196 --> 00:42:19.570
that I do in women's that
could just be modified a little

00:42:19.570 --> 00:42:20.070
for men's.

00:42:20.070 --> 00:42:21.197
ALIA RAZA: Even this.

00:42:21.197 --> 00:42:22.530
TESS GIBERSON: So yeah, exactly.

00:42:22.530 --> 00:42:25.750
There's a lot of and the
sweaters and the outerwear.

00:42:25.750 --> 00:42:28.090
When I was working at
TSE I was overseeing

00:42:28.090 --> 00:42:29.430
the men's collection.

00:42:29.430 --> 00:42:30.230
And I loved it.

00:42:30.230 --> 00:42:33.620
I loved working-- I think
because originally I

00:42:33.620 --> 00:42:34.620
started at Calvin Klein.

00:42:34.620 --> 00:42:38.130
I was in the men's collection,
designing sweaters.

00:42:38.130 --> 00:42:40.140
And there's something
about menswear

00:42:40.140 --> 00:42:43.420
that I really like a lot.

00:42:43.420 --> 00:42:46.140
I think that with my aesthetic,
what I do with women's, it's

00:42:46.140 --> 00:42:49.690
not such a stretch to be
able to modify it a bit.

00:42:49.690 --> 00:42:52.730
But I'm also not trying
to do everything at once.

00:42:52.730 --> 00:42:56.200
I'm trying to do it the right
way, with this relaunching

00:42:56.200 --> 00:42:57.780
the company with my partners.

00:42:57.780 --> 00:42:59.840
We have a plan of
how we want to grow.

00:42:59.840 --> 00:43:03.180
And we're right now just
working on really getting

00:43:03.180 --> 00:43:05.760
everything right with
the women's collection,

00:43:05.760 --> 00:43:09.120
the distribution, really
developing the collection,

00:43:09.120 --> 00:43:10.990
working with the customers.

00:43:10.990 --> 00:43:13.150
And we need to just get
a little bit bigger,

00:43:13.150 --> 00:43:15.850
so we can hire someone else.

00:43:15.850 --> 00:43:21.271
Because I don't want anymore
to work the 16-18 hour days.

00:43:21.271 --> 00:43:23.020
So I know what I want
it to be, and I also

00:43:23.020 --> 00:43:26.710
know the time I need to
allow to do it the right way.

00:43:26.710 --> 00:43:29.225
But it's absolutely
in the near future.

00:43:33.212 --> 00:43:37.835
JULIE GILHART: So, all men
out there, come and see.

00:43:37.835 --> 00:43:39.470
ALIA RAZA: And then
we can do a video

00:43:39.470 --> 00:43:44.598
with cute boys
wearing cute clothes.

00:43:44.598 --> 00:43:47.420
JULIE GILHART: Are
all our dreams.

00:43:47.420 --> 00:43:50.840
So thank you for hosting this.

00:43:50.840 --> 00:43:52.380
Thank you for the introductions.

00:43:52.380 --> 00:43:54.820
Thank you, Google.

00:43:54.820 --> 00:43:57.465
Maybe you'll collaborate
with Google someday.

00:43:57.465 --> 00:44:00.382
TESS GIBERSON: Love to.

00:44:00.382 --> 00:44:01.590
ALIA RAZA: Thank you, Google.

00:44:01.590 --> 00:44:03.950
TESS GIBERSON:
Thank you, Google.
