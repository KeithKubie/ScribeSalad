00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:03.260
To summarize, non-functional qualities,

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:06.520
not just the five that we've looked at but the whole, whole set of them,

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:10.320
can dramatically affect the architectural software system.

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.470
Moreover, real world systems often have multiple

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:16.810
conflicting non-functional qualities.

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:20.570
This means that you as a designer have to make tradeoffs among them.

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:22.820
For each of the quality requirements of your system,

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:26.100
be sure to take into account both the positive and

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:29.960
negative impacts that it will have on the overall system architecture.
