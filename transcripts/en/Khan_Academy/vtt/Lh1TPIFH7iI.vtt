00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.850
- [Instructor] Let's say
that we have two populations.

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:05.760
So that's the first population,

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:08.920
and this is the second
population right over here.

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:10.670
And we are going to think about

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:12.650
the means of these populations.

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:14.350
So let's say this first population

00:00:15.433 --> 00:00:17.000
is a population of golden retrievers

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.450
and this second population is
a population of chihuahuas.

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:22.810
And the mean that we're
going to think about

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:24.410
is maybe the mean weight.

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:27.870
So mu one would be the true mean weight

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:30.320
of the population of golden retrievers.

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:33.200
And mu two would be the true mean weight

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.600
of the population of chihuahuas.

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.050
Now what we want to think about is

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.630
what is the difference between
these two population means,

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:44.570
between these two population parameters.

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:47.890
Well, if we don't know this, all we can do

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:50.340
is try to estimate it and maybe construct

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.320
some type of confidence interval.

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.470
And that's what we're going
to talk about in this video.

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:56.960
So how do we go about doing it?

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.120
Well, we've seen this, or
similar things, before.

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.740
What you would do is
you would take a sample

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:02.870
from both populations.

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.370
So from population one
here, I would take a sample

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:08.310
of size n sub one.

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.260
And from that, I can
calculate a sample mean.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.860
So this is a statistic that
is trying to estimate that.

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.800
And I can also calculate a
sample standard deviation.

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.680
And I can do the same thing in
the population of chihuahuas,

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.430
if that's what our
population two is all about.

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:27.250
So I could take a sample,

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:29.270
and actually this sample
does not have to be the same

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:31.920
as n one, so I'll call it n sub two.

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.090
It could be, but doesn't have to be.

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.331
And from that, I can
calculate a sample mean,

00:01:37.331 --> 00:01:42.331
x bar sub two, and a
sample standard deviation.

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.260
So now, assuming that our
conditions for inference are met,

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.110
and we've talked about those before.

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.190
We have the random condition,
we have the normal condition,

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:54.020
we have the independence condition.

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:55.580
Assuming those conditions are met,

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:58.660
and we talk about those
in other videos for means,

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:00.510
let's think about how we can construct

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:01.680
a confidence interval.

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.680
And so you might say,
alright, well that would be

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.280
the difference of my sample means,

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.330
x bar sub one minus x bar sub two,

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.970
plus or minus some z value,

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.530
times my standard deviation,

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:23.530
times the standard deviation
of the sampling distribution

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.250
of the difference of the sample means.

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:31.840
So x bar sub one minus x bar sub two.

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.260
And you might say, well,
where do I get my z from?

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.880
Well, our confidence level
would determine that.

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.400
Confidence, confidence level.

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.750
If our confidence level is 95%,
that would determine our z.

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:49.122
Now this would not be incorrect,
but we face a problem,

00:02:49.122 --> 00:02:52.120
because we are going to need to estimate

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.950
what the standard deviation
of the sampling distribution

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.660
of the difference between
our sample means actually is.

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:02.400
To make that clear, let
me write it this way.

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.440
So the variance of the
sampling distribution

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.280
of the difference of our sample means

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.611
is going to be equal to the variance

00:03:11.611 --> 00:03:15.900
of the sampling distribution
of sample mean one,

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:19.870
plus the variance of the
sampling distribution

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:22.840
of sample mean two.

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.580
Now if we knew the true
underlying standard deviations

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:29.040
of this population and this population,

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.070
then we could actually come up with these.

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:33.330
In that case, this right over here

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:38.290
would be equal to the
variance of the population

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:43.063
of population one, divided
by our sample size, n one

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:47.340
plus, plus

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:52.670
the variance of the
underlying population two

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:55.320
divided by this sample size.

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:57.680
But we don't know these variances,

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:00.070
and so we try to estimate them.

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:04.720
So we estimate them with our
sample standard deviations.

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.570
So we say this is going to
be approximately equal to

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:11.960
our first sample standard
deviation squared

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:16.960
over n one plus our second
sample standard deviation squared

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:20.890
over n two.

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:25.890
And so we can say that an
estimate of the standard deviation

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:29.590
of the sampling distribution
of the difference

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:32.760
between our sample means and estimate

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:34.450
is going to be equal to
the square root of this.

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:36.410
It's going to be approximately equal to

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:41.170
the square root of s
one squared over n one

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:44.700
plus s two squared over n two.

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:47.810
But the problem is is
once we use this estimate

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:50.700
that we can figure out, a critical z value

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:54.160
isn't going to be as good
as a critical t value.

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:56.850
So instead, you would say
my confidence interval

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:01.300
is going to be x bar sub
one minus x bar sub two

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:05.540
plus or minus a critical t value,

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:06.850
instead of a z value.

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:10.800
Because that works better
when you are estimating

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.850
standard deviation of
the sampling distribution

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:15.710
of the difference
between the sample means.

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:20.710
And so you have t star
times our estimate of this

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:24.080
which is going to be
equal to the square root

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:27.630
of s sub one squared over n one

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:31.490
plus s sub two squared over n two.

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:35.080
And then you might say, well,
what determines our t star?

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:39.240
Well once again, you would
look it up on a table

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:40.820
using your confidence level.

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:42.630
And you might be saying, wait, hold on,

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:45.050
when I look up a t
value, I don't just care

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:47.260
about a confidence
level, I also care about

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.160
degrees of freedom.

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:51.300
What is going to be the degrees of freedom

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:52.530
in this situation?

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:55.010
Well, there's a simple answer
and a complicated answer.

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:56.830
Once we think about the
difference of means,

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:58.610
there's fairly sophisticated formulas

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:00.310
that computers can use to get

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:02.970
a more precise degrees of freedom.

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:05.210
But what you will typical
see in a statistics class

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:07.440
is a conservative view
of degrees of freedom,

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:10.210
where you take the lower
of n one and n two,

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:12.340
and you subtract one from that.

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:14.350
So the degrees of freedom here,

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:16.600
so the degrees of freedom
here is going to be

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:21.600
the lower, lower of n one minus one,

00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:24.610
or n two minus one.

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:26.510
Or you take the lower of n one or n two

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:28.750
and you subtract one from that.

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:31.070
In future videos, we will
work through examples

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:31.993
that do this.
