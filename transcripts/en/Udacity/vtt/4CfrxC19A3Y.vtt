00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:02.810
In this level,
we learned how to make things move.

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:05.680
First, by just keeping track
of how much time had passed.

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:09.730
And then, by updating the world based
on how much time passed between frames.

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:12.530
We also learned how we can make
a game that can easily switch between

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:13.370
different screens.

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:17.260
So, this has been fun and all,
but everything we've made so

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.850
far has pretty much run on autopilot.

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:22.550
So in the next level,
we'll tackle interaction.

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:26.270
We'll learn how to detect and respond to
all sorts of inputs, like key presses,

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:27.760
touches and device orientation.
