00:00:05.324 --> 00:00:08.074
(pleasant music)

00:00:30.522 --> 00:00:32.310
- I'm Margaret Chowning.

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:35.617
I am a historian and I'm also the chair

00:00:35.617 --> 00:00:39.007
of the Moses Lectureship Committee.

00:00:39.007 --> 00:00:41.485
In 1937, University of California

00:00:41.485 --> 00:00:43.531
President Robert Gordon Sproul

00:00:43.531 --> 00:00:45.824
and the UC Board of Regions established

00:00:45.824 --> 00:00:48.070
the Bernard Moses Memorial Lectureship

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:50.518
in the Social Sciences.

00:00:50.518 --> 00:00:53.700
The lectureship honors the
memory of the late Bernard Moses,

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.114
a professor of history
and political science

00:00:56.114 --> 00:00:57.674
at the University of California

00:00:57.674 --> 00:01:01.257
from 1875 to 1911 and
an Emeritus professor

00:01:02.332 --> 00:01:05.165
from 1911 until his death in 1930.

00:01:06.172 --> 00:01:08.794
Professor Moses earned
a worldwide reputation

00:01:08.794 --> 00:01:10.903
for his contributions to understanding

00:01:10.903 --> 00:01:13.643
the problems of the
Latin American Republics

00:01:13.643 --> 00:01:15.977
and as a pioneer scholar.

00:01:15.977 --> 00:01:18.413
Professor Moses served as a
member of the United States

00:01:18.413 --> 00:01:21.746
Philippine Commission from 1900 to 1904.

00:01:23.215 --> 00:01:26.638
Past lecturers have
included Herma Hill Kay,

00:01:26.638 --> 00:01:29.317
Nicholas Riasanovsky, George Lakoff,

00:01:29.317 --> 00:01:32.412
Kenneth Stampp, Carolyn
Merchant, Jean Lave,

00:01:32.412 --> 00:01:36.579
Emmanuel Saez, Yuri Slezkine,
Aihwa Ong, and Mary Ann Mason.

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:39.945
And now I'd like to say a few words

00:01:39.945 --> 00:01:43.169
about our speaker today, Ann Swidler.

00:01:43.169 --> 00:01:45.529
Professor Swidler is a
distinguished sociologist

00:01:45.529 --> 00:01:48.417
whose work is highly
influential in how scholars

00:01:48.417 --> 00:01:52.584
think about culture, religion
and social institutions.

00:01:53.879 --> 00:01:56.362
She's often cited for
her now classic article,

00:01:56.362 --> 00:01:59.578
Culture In Action, published in 1986,

00:01:59.578 --> 00:02:02.122
in which she presents
the idea that culture

00:02:02.122 --> 00:02:06.424
shapes a toolkit of
styles, skills and habits

00:02:06.424 --> 00:02:10.627
which in turn shape individual's
strategies of action.

00:02:10.627 --> 00:02:13.554
Swidler's interest in
culture and institutions

00:02:13.554 --> 00:02:16.562
led to the study of how
societies in sub-Saharan Africa

00:02:16.562 --> 00:02:19.064
responded to the AIDS pandemic.

00:02:19.064 --> 00:02:22.081
Her recent work analyzes
global and local responses

00:02:22.081 --> 00:02:24.857
to this epidemic in Africa looking at how

00:02:24.857 --> 00:02:27.144
the massive international AIDS effort

00:02:27.144 --> 00:02:29.748
interacts with existing African cultural

00:02:29.748 --> 00:02:32.157
and institutional patterns.

00:02:32.157 --> 00:02:35.012
Her newest book, with Susan Cotts Watkins,

00:02:35.012 --> 00:02:38.641
is A Fraught Embrace:
The Romance and Reality

00:02:38.641 --> 00:02:41.404
of AIDS Altruism in Africa,

00:02:41.404 --> 00:02:45.721
forthcoming from Princeton
University Press.

00:02:45.721 --> 00:02:47.736
Professor Swidler earned
her masters and doctorate

00:02:47.736 --> 00:02:51.079
in sociology at UC Berkeley
and her undergraduate degree

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:54.320
cum laude from Harvard University.

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:59.120
A professor in the Department
of Sociology since 1987,

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.241
she also taught on the sociology faculty

00:03:01.241 --> 00:03:03.343
at Harvard and at Stanford.

00:03:03.343 --> 00:03:05.856
Additionally, she has
been a Guggenheim fellow,

00:03:05.856 --> 00:03:07.231
French-American Foundation

00:03:07.231 --> 00:03:09.711
Professor of American Civilization,

00:03:09.711 --> 00:03:12.288
fellow of the Successful Societies Program

00:03:12.288 --> 00:03:15.406
of the Canadian Institute
for Advanced Research,

00:03:15.406 --> 00:03:18.648
visiting scholar at The
Russell Sage Foundation

00:03:18.648 --> 00:03:22.476
and fellow of the American
Academy of Arts and Sciences.

00:03:22.476 --> 00:03:24.437
Ann Swidler's lecture first inquires

00:03:24.437 --> 00:03:26.984
as to what makes institutions good

00:03:26.984 --> 00:03:29.596
before questioning how such institutions

00:03:29.596 --> 00:03:33.610
might be achieved given
our current political,

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:37.777
social, and economic
conditions, yikes (chuckles).

00:03:39.261 --> 00:03:41.208
Drawing on several studies of politics

00:03:41.208 --> 00:03:43.977
across national contexts,
including her studies

00:03:43.977 --> 00:03:46.978
of chieftaincy in sub-Saharan Africa,

00:03:46.978 --> 00:03:48.679
Swidler's lecture will highlight critical

00:03:48.679 --> 00:03:50.795
institutional features that most analysts

00:03:50.795 --> 00:03:53.192
of political institutions neglect.

00:03:53.192 --> 00:03:55.794
Long temporal horizons, shared cultural

00:03:55.794 --> 00:03:59.567
and ritual forms, systems
of status aggregation,

00:03:59.567 --> 00:04:02.982
narrative power and elite consolidation.

00:04:02.982 --> 00:04:05.773
Please join me in welcoming
Professor Ann Swidler.

00:04:05.773 --> 00:04:08.773
(audience applauds)

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:12.597
- Thank you very much.

00:04:12.597 --> 00:04:16.957
This is a tremendous honor
and I'm delighted to be here.

00:04:16.957 --> 00:04:19.306
Giving this lecture got a lot harder,

00:04:19.306 --> 00:04:20.730
but the ideas it grapples with

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:23.737
are even more important
after November 8th.

00:04:23.737 --> 00:04:26.837
Perhaps the relevant caution
is that in our reaction

00:04:26.837 --> 00:04:29.629
to the election, further weakening of

00:04:29.629 --> 00:04:33.344
American institutions is the wrong answer.

00:04:33.344 --> 00:04:35.681
This was a traumatic
election in which our own

00:04:35.681 --> 00:04:39.783
political institutions seemed
continuously under assault.

00:04:39.783 --> 00:04:41.994
Aware of the longer-term fraying of many

00:04:41.994 --> 00:04:45.444
of the institutional practices
we may have taken for granted

00:04:45.444 --> 00:04:48.022
as a solid framework for our lives

00:04:48.022 --> 00:04:49.851
it is even more necessary to think about

00:04:49.851 --> 00:04:53.618
whether we can create good institutions.

00:04:53.618 --> 00:04:55.933
I want to begin by discussing

00:04:55.933 --> 00:04:58.766
the words of my title, one by one.

00:05:00.334 --> 00:05:02.198
I'll start with we.

00:05:02.198 --> 00:05:04.145
I am thinking of we in two potentially

00:05:04.145 --> 00:05:05.926
very different senses.

00:05:05.926 --> 00:05:09.565
One is the we I have been
studying in sub-Saharan Africa.

00:05:09.565 --> 00:05:12.148
We, not necessarily all of you,

00:05:13.212 --> 00:05:15.893
of the developed West, as
we look around the world

00:05:15.893 --> 00:05:17.993
and attempt, usually unsuccessfully

00:05:17.993 --> 00:05:21.438
to build or reconstruct state
or community institutions

00:05:21.438 --> 00:05:23.943
in places as diverse as formerly war-torn

00:05:23.943 --> 00:05:27.301
Liberia and Sierra Leone, or more urgently

00:05:27.301 --> 00:05:30.069
Afghanistan, Somalia, Libya and other

00:05:30.069 --> 00:05:32.107
failed or near-failing states

00:05:32.107 --> 00:05:36.356
or most notoriously as
we failed spectacularly

00:05:36.356 --> 00:05:38.253
to help build or rebuild a state in Iraq

00:05:38.253 --> 00:05:42.832
after the 2003 invasion that
overthrew Saddam Hussein.

00:05:42.832 --> 00:05:46.259
Colin Powell is said to
have warned George W. Bush.

00:05:46.259 --> 00:05:49.740
Pottery Barn rules, you
break it, it's yours.

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:53.919
But that catastrophe revealed
more than Bush's fecklessness.

00:05:53.919 --> 00:05:56.339
We have lots of ideas,
some only fantasies,

00:05:56.339 --> 00:05:58.621
about how to dismantle power,

00:05:58.621 --> 00:06:02.184
suspicion of government, a
distrust of power and of elites,

00:06:02.184 --> 00:06:05.017
run deep in American political culture.

00:06:05.017 --> 00:06:08.066
But just think how bare
our cupboard of ideas

00:06:08.066 --> 00:06:10.445
was when we tried to rebuild

00:06:10.445 --> 00:06:13.346
after dismantling the Iraqi government.

00:06:13.346 --> 00:06:15.930
We are inept in nation building even when

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:18.206
we attempt to create more egalitarian,

00:06:18.206 --> 00:06:22.817
democratic, participatory
or empowering institutions.

00:06:22.817 --> 00:06:24.975
It is easy to condemn
the Bush administration

00:06:24.975 --> 00:06:27.285
for giving no thought
to post-invasion Iraqi

00:06:27.285 --> 00:06:30.303
law and order, for purging
Sunnis from the military

00:06:30.303 --> 00:06:32.389
and the civil service and so on.

00:06:32.389 --> 00:06:34.721
But what I find even more frightening

00:06:34.721 --> 00:06:37.286
about the failed
post-invasion reconstruction

00:06:37.286 --> 00:06:40.737
is that the experts we sent
to do the nation building

00:06:40.737 --> 00:06:42.455
were a small group with expertise

00:06:42.455 --> 00:06:45.538
in guess what, writing constitutions.

00:06:47.892 --> 00:06:50.499
That is where our expertise
and institution building

00:06:50.499 --> 00:06:53.327
more or less begins and ends.

00:06:53.327 --> 00:06:55.951
An idea that fits with our
own political narrative

00:06:55.951 --> 00:06:59.992
but has little applicability elsewhere.

00:06:59.992 --> 00:07:03.945
I also mean we in another and
perhaps more urgent sense.

00:07:03.945 --> 00:07:06.857
We ourselves as we now
try to protect, sustain,

00:07:06.857 --> 00:07:11.308
adapt or rebuild the institutions
upon which we depend.

00:07:11.308 --> 00:07:14.582
Here we may think of
institutions as precious

00:07:14.582 --> 00:07:18.155
and apparently fragile
as the university itself,

00:07:18.155 --> 00:07:19.545
local community institutions,

00:07:19.545 --> 00:07:22.099
or institutions like marriage and family,

00:07:22.099 --> 00:07:25.930
or the regulatory institutions
that structure our economy.

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:28.079
We lack both theory and research about how

00:07:28.079 --> 00:07:29.937
to preserve the institutional legacies

00:07:29.937 --> 00:07:32.102
that hold our social life together

00:07:32.102 --> 00:07:34.244
while adapting to changing circumstances

00:07:34.244 --> 00:07:36.334
for reworking institutions so that

00:07:36.334 --> 00:07:39.167
they more fully embody our ideals.

00:07:40.491 --> 00:07:42.658
Now the word institutions.

00:07:43.603 --> 00:07:46.328
The term institutions long the provenance

00:07:46.328 --> 00:07:48.534
of anthropologists and sociologists

00:07:48.534 --> 00:07:51.227
has more recently become the hot topic

00:07:51.227 --> 00:07:54.127
in political science
and economics as well.

00:07:54.127 --> 00:07:56.092
The reasons for this
ascendance are relatively

00:07:56.092 --> 00:07:59.308
straightforward and come
from several directions.

00:07:59.308 --> 00:08:01.676
As economists and political
scientists explore

00:08:01.676 --> 00:08:04.974
the limits of rational choice
theories of human behavior

00:08:04.974 --> 00:08:07.666
they faced Hobbes's
question, if people pursue

00:08:07.666 --> 00:08:09.756
their self-interests
what creates and enforces

00:08:09.756 --> 00:08:12.755
the rules that govern that competition?

00:08:12.755 --> 00:08:16.577
These are the quote "non-contractual
elements of contract

00:08:16.577 --> 00:08:19.385
"essential to any contract
the rules that determine

00:08:19.385 --> 00:08:21.703
"a contract's validity and the authority

00:08:21.703 --> 00:08:24.499
"that enforces its
provisions can't be created

00:08:24.499 --> 00:08:26.771
"by the contracting parties themselves."

00:08:26.771 --> 00:08:28.261
So scholars ask where do the rules

00:08:28.261 --> 00:08:31.983
and the authority to
enforce the rules come from?

00:08:31.983 --> 00:08:34.161
The current preoccupation
with institutions

00:08:34.161 --> 00:08:36.941
also comes from more pressing concerns.

00:08:36.941 --> 00:08:39.223
After the breakup of the Soviet Union

00:08:39.223 --> 00:08:41.718
it seemed evident that challenging power

00:08:41.718 --> 00:08:43.686
needed to be complemented by concern

00:08:43.686 --> 00:08:45.805
with governance and I
remembered this moment

00:08:45.805 --> 00:08:49.694
when the Berkeley edited
journal Representations

00:08:49.694 --> 00:08:53.764
changed its editorial
statement to acknowledge

00:08:53.764 --> 00:08:57.431
that criticizing power
was not the only task

00:08:58.338 --> 00:09:02.171
that intellectuals needed
to pay attention to.

00:09:03.145 --> 00:09:06.564
So with the dangers of
chaos, ethnic fragmentation,

00:09:06.564 --> 00:09:08.860
as in the Balkans in civil war

00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:11.213
new institutions also seem vital to meet

00:09:11.213 --> 00:09:13.588
the challenges of the global social order

00:09:13.588 --> 00:09:16.883
in which we have vast
biological, social and economic

00:09:16.883 --> 00:09:20.391
interdependencies without
an organizational capacity

00:09:20.391 --> 00:09:22.147
to manage that interdependence,

00:09:22.147 --> 00:09:25.778
and that is certainly the
challenge that the next generation

00:09:25.778 --> 00:09:30.101
should we have a next
generation will face.

00:09:30.101 --> 00:09:32.012
So what are institutions?

00:09:32.012 --> 00:09:33.795
The minimal definition of an institution

00:09:33.795 --> 00:09:38.311
is a set of rules and the
ability to enforce them.

00:09:38.311 --> 00:09:42.224
Or slightly expanded, a
pattern of expected action

00:09:42.224 --> 00:09:46.009
of individuals or groups
enforced by social sanctions

00:09:46.009 --> 00:09:48.009
both positive and negative.

00:09:48.009 --> 00:09:50.728
An institution may be as
informal as the custom

00:09:50.728 --> 00:09:53.497
of shaking hands in a social situation,

00:09:53.497 --> 00:09:56.289
where the refusal to respond
to an outstretched hand

00:09:56.289 --> 00:10:00.025
might cause embarrassment and
some need for an explanation.

00:10:00.025 --> 00:10:03.719
Or institutions may be
formal sets of complex rules

00:10:03.719 --> 00:10:06.477
that organize entire
domains of social life

00:10:06.477 --> 00:10:10.644
like the corporation, the
university, the family, the state.

00:10:13.379 --> 00:10:16.763
It is also evident that
however external and objective

00:10:16.763 --> 00:10:19.942
institutions may feel at any given moment

00:10:19.942 --> 00:10:22.499
government, the university,
marriage and the market

00:10:22.499 --> 00:10:25.479
are also subject to constant renegotiation

00:10:25.479 --> 00:10:27.776
of their defining features, their rules,

00:10:27.776 --> 00:10:29.944
and their actual rewards and sanctions.

00:10:29.944 --> 00:10:32.132
So the paradox of institutions

00:10:32.132 --> 00:10:34.924
and I think this is something none of us

00:10:34.924 --> 00:10:38.842
have ever fully wrapped
our heads around is that

00:10:38.842 --> 00:10:41.286
on the one hand institutions stand as

00:10:41.286 --> 00:10:44.357
obdurate, enduring, that's
part of what the word

00:10:44.357 --> 00:10:48.293
institutionalized implies,
enduring structures

00:10:48.293 --> 00:10:50.667
that are in some sense out there

00:10:50.667 --> 00:10:52.867
and we orient ourselves to them,

00:10:52.867 --> 00:10:56.292
and yet we are also
constantly modifying them.

00:10:56.292 --> 00:10:59.733
And so one of the questions
is what are the limits?

00:10:59.733 --> 00:11:03.670
In what ways do institutions sometimes

00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:06.927
appear unmodifiable and at other times

00:11:06.927 --> 00:11:09.844
appear utterly fragile and easy to,

00:11:11.478 --> 00:11:14.235
relatively easy to change.

00:11:14.235 --> 00:11:16.815
So to these features a set of relatively

00:11:16.815 --> 00:11:19.545
stable rules and the associated
rewards and sanctions

00:11:19.545 --> 00:11:21.826
that enforce these rules I would add

00:11:21.826 --> 00:11:24.601
a third crucial feature
and for those of you

00:11:24.601 --> 00:11:27.689
who know I'm thinking very
strongly here of Philip Selznick

00:11:27.689 --> 00:11:31.856
and his, the sociological
tradition from which he came.

00:11:33.869 --> 00:11:38.324
The implicit or explicit
purposes these forms serve

00:11:38.324 --> 00:11:40.808
purposes are integral to institutions

00:11:40.808 --> 00:11:42.341
so that we really cannot understand

00:11:42.341 --> 00:11:45.173
how they operate
concretely without thinking

00:11:45.173 --> 00:11:47.640
about the purposes that justify them.

00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:50.485
For example, if the purpose of a handshake

00:11:50.485 --> 00:11:54.199
is to greet someone while
suggesting friendly intentions

00:11:54.199 --> 00:11:57.374
one can decline a handshake with a smile

00:11:57.374 --> 00:12:00.062
and an apology for having one's hands full

00:12:00.062 --> 00:12:04.567
substituting the intention
for the actual action.

00:12:04.567 --> 00:12:08.270
As we have redefined formal
institutions like marriage

00:12:08.270 --> 00:12:10.571
a sense of their larger purposes has also

00:12:10.571 --> 00:12:12.486
been essential to the debate,

00:12:12.486 --> 00:12:14.192
so we modified the formal structures

00:12:14.192 --> 00:12:16.066
of our institutions in light of

00:12:16.066 --> 00:12:19.805
what we understand their purposes to be.

00:12:19.805 --> 00:12:21.534
Purposes play a more central role

00:12:21.534 --> 00:12:25.594
than many scholars recognize
in how institutions work.

00:12:25.594 --> 00:12:28.861
So the university is an institution

00:12:28.861 --> 00:12:31.949
a set of recognized
structures, rules and purposes

00:12:31.949 --> 00:12:34.037
that would allow us
for example to know how

00:12:34.037 --> 00:12:37.174
to start a new university
that is it's something

00:12:37.174 --> 00:12:41.331
like a recipe or a model
that's out there even

00:12:41.331 --> 00:12:43.891
when it's not being used and should we

00:12:43.891 --> 00:12:46.427
decide to initiate a
new university probably

00:12:46.427 --> 00:12:49.595
a foolish venture at this
moment in history but anyway

00:12:49.595 --> 00:12:51.467
we would assemble professors, students,

00:12:51.467 --> 00:12:53.867
labs, classrooms and so forth.

00:12:53.867 --> 00:12:56.475
But even with all these
ingredients assembled

00:12:56.475 --> 00:12:58.807
we would deny the term university

00:12:58.807 --> 00:13:01.895
to what is only a profit
making organization

00:13:01.895 --> 00:13:04.314
without an educational mission,

00:13:04.314 --> 00:13:05.713
although this is certainly the boundary

00:13:05.713 --> 00:13:09.144
that Trump University
for example has tested.

00:13:09.144 --> 00:13:12.377
We say that isn't a real university

00:13:12.377 --> 00:13:15.544
no matter what its name is and that's,

00:13:16.543 --> 00:13:18.734
I just want you to
recognize that your ability

00:13:18.734 --> 00:13:21.984
to say that isn't a real X is precisely

00:13:24.067 --> 00:13:28.097
a measure of the reality of the
existence of an institution.

00:13:28.097 --> 00:13:32.264
If that gap can't exist then
you don't have an institution.

00:13:33.855 --> 00:13:37.058
There is a tension between
an institutionalized form

00:13:37.058 --> 00:13:39.374
and it's actual instantiation

00:13:39.374 --> 00:13:42.732
at any given moment or in any given form.

00:13:42.732 --> 00:13:45.213
My co-authors and I
describe this in our book,

00:13:45.213 --> 00:13:48.724
The Good Society, using
the example of baseball.

00:13:48.724 --> 00:13:52.444
And I quote us, "Baseball
with its purposes,

00:13:52.444 --> 00:13:56.139
"codes and standards, is a
collective moral enterprise.

00:13:56.139 --> 00:13:58.411
"An institution in the full sense

00:13:58.411 --> 00:14:01.087
"and many Americans care deeply about it.

00:14:01.087 --> 00:14:03.758
"As an institution baseball
is more than the actual

00:14:03.758 --> 00:14:06.620
"players and organizations
who play the game

00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:08.703
"during any given season.

00:14:10.579 --> 00:14:12.842
"This was beautifully expressed in 1989

00:14:12.842 --> 00:14:14.775
"when the former President of Yale,

00:14:14.775 --> 00:14:18.624
"late Baseball Commissioner
A. Bartlett Giamatti

00:14:18.624 --> 00:14:21.434
"announced his decision to
ban Pete Rose from Baseball

00:14:21.434 --> 00:14:23.779
"for having gambled on the sport,

00:14:23.779 --> 00:14:26.478
"and Giamatti wrote, 'I
believe that baseball

00:14:26.478 --> 00:14:29.880
'is an important, enduring
American institution.

00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:33.619
'It must assert and aspire
to the highest of principals

00:14:33.619 --> 00:14:37.171
'of integrity, of
professionalism, of performance,

00:14:37.171 --> 00:14:39.916
'of fair play within its rules.

00:14:39.916 --> 00:14:42.706
'It will come as no surprise
that like any institution

00:14:42.706 --> 00:14:45.322
'composed of human beings this institution

00:14:45.322 --> 00:14:48.079
'will not always fulfill
its highest aspirations.

00:14:48.079 --> 00:14:51.084
'I know of no earthly
institution that does.

00:14:51.084 --> 00:14:53.519
'But this one because it is so much a part

00:14:53.519 --> 00:14:55.303
'of our history as a
people and because it has

00:14:55.303 --> 00:14:57.797
'such a purchase on our national soul

00:14:57.797 --> 00:15:00.661
'has an obligation to the
people for whom it is played,

00:15:00.661 --> 00:15:02.715
'to its fans and its well-wishers,

00:15:02.715 --> 00:15:05.201
'to strive for excellence in all things

00:15:05.201 --> 00:15:07.715
'and to promote the highest ideals.'

00:15:07.715 --> 00:15:09.555
"We make the same distinction when we say

00:15:09.555 --> 00:15:13.856
"that a decision by our
university was unworthy of it

00:15:13.856 --> 00:15:16.736
"or betrayed its mission,
or when we make a similar

00:15:16.736 --> 00:15:19.801
"judgment about whether
members of a real family

00:15:19.801 --> 00:15:21.482
"would treat each other in certain ways,

00:15:21.482 --> 00:15:24.990
"or whether a real friend
would betray a confidence.

00:15:24.990 --> 00:15:27.846
"Thus institutional forms
are defined by purposes

00:15:27.846 --> 00:15:31.513
"that transcend their
concrete limitations."

00:15:32.484 --> 00:15:34.806
Okay why do purposes matter?

00:15:34.806 --> 00:15:37.639
Institutionally defined purposes matter

00:15:37.639 --> 00:15:41.418
not only when they sound
moral and high-minded.

00:15:41.418 --> 00:15:44.569
Such purposes allow those
working in actual organizations

00:15:44.569 --> 00:15:47.908
to coordinate their activities
as when a corporation

00:15:47.908 --> 00:15:51.223
sees its purposes profit,
or when a university

00:15:51.223 --> 00:15:55.390
defines itself as devoted
to scholarship or learning.

00:15:57.588 --> 00:16:00.734
To use an example with which
many of us are familiar

00:16:00.734 --> 00:16:02.261
while we may be cynical about whether

00:16:02.261 --> 00:16:05.796
teaching and scholarly
action, excellence sorry,

00:16:05.796 --> 00:16:09.101
actually guide every decision
we make in the university.

00:16:09.101 --> 00:16:13.432
Without a sense of such
purposes how could we decide

00:16:13.432 --> 00:16:15.670
what undergraduates to admit,

00:16:15.670 --> 00:16:18.732
what graduate students
should receive fellowships,

00:16:18.732 --> 00:16:21.725
which faculty to hire or promote,

00:16:21.725 --> 00:16:24.605
and the hundreds of other
decisions we make daily

00:16:24.605 --> 00:16:27.469
about grading, writing
letters of recommendation,

00:16:27.469 --> 00:16:30.882
designing courses and
hundreds of other tasks

00:16:30.882 --> 00:16:34.394
if we did not have the
discourse available to us?

00:16:34.394 --> 00:16:38.066
Perhaps a discourse with
multiple visions and contention

00:16:38.066 --> 00:16:41.627
about the fundamental
purposes of the university.

00:16:41.627 --> 00:16:45.724
Those purposes link institutional
models and their ideals

00:16:45.724 --> 00:16:49.891
to the nitty-gritty struggles
of daily organizational life.

00:16:51.014 --> 00:16:52.514
Now the word good.

00:16:53.496 --> 00:16:55.547
Then what are good institutions?

00:16:55.547 --> 00:16:58.088
I have a very simple
definition of good institutions

00:16:58.088 --> 00:17:00.022
although in practice it's quite difficult

00:17:00.022 --> 00:17:01.454
to measure and evaluate institutions

00:17:01.454 --> 00:17:03.613
along a single dimension.

00:17:03.613 --> 00:17:06.324
Good institutions for
my purposes are those

00:17:06.324 --> 00:17:10.800
that create and maintain
collective goods, ah ha.

00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:14.483
Goods, the good maintain goods, all right.

00:17:14.483 --> 00:17:17.045
What I mean by collective
goods, and this overlaps

00:17:17.045 --> 00:17:19.669
with what economists mean by public goods,

00:17:19.669 --> 00:17:22.693
are peace and security,
infrastructure such as

00:17:22.693 --> 00:17:25.486
roads and clean water,
and services such as

00:17:25.486 --> 00:17:28.636
public health, education,
economic opportunity,

00:17:28.636 --> 00:17:30.177
justice and the rule of law

00:17:30.177 --> 00:17:34.130
and at national and global
levels effective responses

00:17:34.130 --> 00:17:38.658
to such matters as climate
change, global health and peace.

00:17:38.658 --> 00:17:41.053
Other conceptions of what
makes good institutions

00:17:41.053 --> 00:17:44.337
like (mumbles) definition
of justice is the capacities

00:17:44.337 --> 00:17:47.350
that nurture human freedom,
or ideas of democracy

00:17:47.350 --> 00:17:51.007
and equality are important
ideals but building them

00:17:51.007 --> 00:17:54.855
into the definition of good
institutions blinkers us I think

00:17:54.855 --> 00:17:57.818
since most institutions
throughout most of human history

00:17:57.818 --> 00:18:02.697
did not meet our particularly
modern conceptions of good.

00:18:02.697 --> 00:18:05.292
Finally, the word create.

00:18:05.292 --> 00:18:08.091
Usually we don't imagine
creating institutions

00:18:08.091 --> 00:18:11.389
but rather inheriting them
from the distant past.

00:18:11.389 --> 00:18:12.855
Indeed while there are moments of

00:18:12.855 --> 00:18:15.017
radical institutional innovation.

00:18:15.017 --> 00:18:17.478
The Constitutional Congress
of the United States,

00:18:17.478 --> 00:18:18.912
the formation of the League of Nations,

00:18:18.912 --> 00:18:22.679
or the United Nations, or the
International Criminal Court.

00:18:22.679 --> 00:18:25.007
We usually inherit institutions

00:18:25.007 --> 00:18:27.173
and modify them only gradually.

00:18:27.173 --> 00:18:30.224
Indeed the conundrum we
face at the current moment

00:18:30.224 --> 00:18:33.076
is that institutions
seem so easy to destroy

00:18:33.076 --> 00:18:35.159
but very hard to rebuild.

00:18:36.071 --> 00:18:39.884
Institutions depend on the
past in two fundamental ways,

00:18:39.884 --> 00:18:44.051
one is that over time institutional
endowments accumulate.

00:18:45.045 --> 00:18:47.054
This can be true in the
literal sense as when

00:18:47.054 --> 00:18:50.751
a university accumulates a
large financial endowment,

00:18:50.751 --> 00:18:53.125
but also in a larger cultural sense

00:18:53.125 --> 00:18:55.594
when the loyalties and
commitments of an organization's

00:18:55.594 --> 00:18:59.326
members or its prestige or reputation

00:18:59.326 --> 00:19:02.699
what we would now cynically call its brand

00:19:02.699 --> 00:19:04.832
have accumulated in many small increments

00:19:04.832 --> 00:19:07.105
over a long period of time.

00:19:07.105 --> 00:19:09.969
The ability of a government
to exercise authority,

00:19:09.969 --> 00:19:12.081
of a tax system to collect taxes,

00:19:12.081 --> 00:19:16.248
or for example the Supreme
Court to enforce its directives

00:19:17.103 --> 00:19:21.270
may depend precisely on such
long accumulated endowments.

00:19:23.431 --> 00:19:25.804
This image of institutional endowments

00:19:25.804 --> 00:19:29.785
and I will point out the danger
of institutional depletion

00:19:29.785 --> 00:19:33.421
as legacies of the distant
past is odd however

00:19:33.421 --> 00:19:36.026
since we also know that
institutions are continuously

00:19:36.026 --> 00:19:40.620
being adapted even while sometimes
claiming ancient lineage.

00:19:40.620 --> 00:19:44.097
So for example the institutions
of marriage and family

00:19:44.097 --> 00:19:46.843
have been altered frequently
throughout American history.

00:19:46.843 --> 00:19:51.010
It isn't just marriage
equality that is gay marriage.

00:19:51.957 --> 00:19:53.697
Changes in laws about women's ability

00:19:53.697 --> 00:19:56.507
to inherit property, the
shifting authority of husbands

00:19:56.507 --> 00:19:59.718
over wives and children,
and most important perhaps

00:19:59.718 --> 00:20:02.116
the shift in the ease and
financial consequences

00:20:02.116 --> 00:20:04.223
of a divorce have changed not only

00:20:04.223 --> 00:20:06.869
the practical realities
of marriage but also

00:20:06.869 --> 00:20:10.516
the moral understandings of its purposes.

00:20:10.516 --> 00:20:12.969
From a primarily economic partnership

00:20:12.969 --> 00:20:15.117
meant to support the rearing of children,

00:20:15.117 --> 00:20:17.157
to a relationship meant to provide

00:20:17.157 --> 00:20:20.692
love and companionship
to its participants.

00:20:20.692 --> 00:20:23.089
Thus, institutions are
inherited from the past

00:20:23.089 --> 00:20:26.896
but there is a slight of
hand infusing older forms

00:20:26.896 --> 00:20:30.137
with new meanings and purposes,

00:20:30.137 --> 00:20:31.864
so why does the past matter so much

00:20:31.864 --> 00:20:34.529
for institutions to function effectively,

00:20:34.529 --> 00:20:39.395
and yet in another sense
the past matters so little?

00:20:39.395 --> 00:20:41.004
This is the heart of the difficulty

00:20:41.004 --> 00:20:44.250
of imagining and creating
good institutions.

00:20:44.250 --> 00:20:46.863
Here I want to start
talking about what we know

00:20:46.863 --> 00:20:51.274
from research literature
that I have pulled together

00:20:51.274 --> 00:20:53.254
from several different places.

00:20:53.254 --> 00:20:54.961
First, I want to talk about a recent paper

00:20:54.961 --> 00:20:58.583
by three economists among
them Berkeley's Ted Miguel

00:20:58.583 --> 00:21:01.032
which involved a three and a half year

00:21:01.032 --> 00:21:04.964
Norwegian funded project
in war-torn Sierra Leone

00:21:04.964 --> 00:21:07.396
that started to, sought to encourage more

00:21:07.396 --> 00:21:10.920
democratic, egalitarian, participatory

00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:15.680
and especially gender-inclusive
decision making.

00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:19.256
The NGO that was running the big project

00:21:19.256 --> 00:21:23.941
selected 236 villages,
this is just a huge sample

00:21:23.941 --> 00:21:25.472
if you think about what they,

00:21:25.472 --> 00:21:28.051
I mean the ambition of this is amazing.

00:21:28.051 --> 00:21:29.845
And with the guidance of the researcher

00:21:29.845 --> 00:21:31.714
they randomized those villages so that

00:21:31.714 --> 00:21:34.714
118 villages received this intensive

00:21:35.742 --> 00:21:37.310
training and encouragement to develop

00:21:37.310 --> 00:21:41.355
participatory decision making
and the other 118 villages

00:21:41.355 --> 00:21:45.640
were left to make decisions
as they always had.

00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:48.508
Local project facilitators
stayed in the villages

00:21:48.508 --> 00:21:50.580
working with the new more representative

00:21:50.580 --> 00:21:52.931
decision making groups that had formed.

00:21:52.931 --> 00:21:54.657
They monitored the groups to make sure

00:21:54.657 --> 00:21:56.790
women were really participating.

00:21:56.790 --> 00:21:58.714
They gave them small
grants to that they could

00:21:58.714 --> 00:22:01.692
work together to make collective decisions

00:22:01.692 --> 00:22:04.833
to kind of practice decision
making where it mattered.

00:22:04.833 --> 00:22:07.643
and they actually did,
the groups successfully

00:22:07.643 --> 00:22:11.503
made decisions together using
more participatory methods.

00:22:11.503 --> 00:22:13.138
They built a small project once they

00:22:13.138 --> 00:22:14.992
had succeeded in doing that

00:22:14.992 --> 00:22:17.110
they received a larger grant and again

00:22:17.110 --> 00:22:19.059
with lots of training and monitoring,

00:22:19.059 --> 00:22:22.982
and participation by facilitators
who were local people

00:22:22.982 --> 00:22:25.806
who lived in the villages and who visited

00:22:25.806 --> 00:22:29.643
every village for one
full day a week minimum,

00:22:29.643 --> 00:22:33.068
so this went on for three years.

00:22:33.068 --> 00:22:34.983
All the while being
coached, trained, encouraged

00:22:34.983 --> 00:22:36.566
and so on and so forth.

00:22:36.566 --> 00:22:38.872
At the end of the
project the research team

00:22:38.872 --> 00:22:41.949
assessed decision making
in all the villages.

00:22:41.949 --> 00:22:44.724
First they ran a public goods game

00:22:44.724 --> 00:22:47.607
and this is when each participant in an

00:22:47.607 --> 00:22:50.390
experimental setting is given
a small amount of money.

00:22:50.390 --> 00:22:52.596
This was the equivalent
of about two dollars

00:22:52.596 --> 00:22:54.081
which would be enormously valuable

00:22:54.081 --> 00:22:56.831
in any very poor African country.

00:22:58.151 --> 00:22:59.986
And participants had a choice about

00:22:59.986 --> 00:23:02.427
whether to put some or all of the money

00:23:02.427 --> 00:23:04.943
in a common pot where it would be spent

00:23:04.943 --> 00:23:08.705
for some village project or
whether to keep the money.

00:23:08.705 --> 00:23:13.101
And they could choose how
much to put to each use.

00:23:13.101 --> 00:23:15.191
Second the researchers,
and this is the very

00:23:15.191 --> 00:23:17.327
clever part of this I have to say,

00:23:17.327 --> 00:23:19.637
as they were packing up
at the end of the study

00:23:19.637 --> 00:23:21.809
offered each village a gift to thank them

00:23:21.809 --> 00:23:24.252
for all the participation and so forth.

00:23:24.252 --> 00:23:28.467
Either a big box with a lot
of batteries, small batteries,

00:23:28.467 --> 00:23:31.793
or a big box with little bags of salt

00:23:31.793 --> 00:23:35.960
that they had measured to
be exactly equivalent in

00:23:37.872 --> 00:23:40.531
money value to the batteries,
so there was no difference

00:23:40.531 --> 00:23:43.833
in which was more valuable
and they left both boxes

00:23:43.833 --> 00:23:46.457
in the village telling
villagers that they would return

00:23:46.457 --> 00:23:48.146
at the end of the day and whichever one

00:23:48.146 --> 00:23:51.937
the villagers didn't want
they would take back.

00:23:51.937 --> 00:23:55.186
They also without making
explicit that this

00:23:55.186 --> 00:23:58.692
was part of their study,
left behind a big tarp

00:23:58.692 --> 00:24:01.236
like a big blue tarp that they had used

00:24:01.236 --> 00:24:02.990
and they just said we
don't need this anymore

00:24:02.990 --> 00:24:05.498
we're leaving it and
then finally they gave

00:24:05.498 --> 00:24:09.405
every village a voucher,
another gift to thank them

00:24:09.405 --> 00:24:12.052
for their participation and help

00:24:12.052 --> 00:24:13.838
the voucher for the local hardware store

00:24:13.838 --> 00:24:16.635
that could be spent however they wanted.

00:24:16.635 --> 00:24:20.692
And they had their own people
who were still packing up

00:24:20.692 --> 00:24:23.921
all the stuff they had
been doing in the villages

00:24:23.921 --> 00:24:26.531
observe how decisions were made and then

00:24:26.531 --> 00:24:29.488
their research team came
back some months later

00:24:29.488 --> 00:24:31.648
and since they knew
every physical structure

00:24:31.648 --> 00:24:35.710
in every village they could
judge what had happened

00:24:35.710 --> 00:24:39.137
to that tarp, was it now forming a crucial

00:24:39.137 --> 00:24:43.583
bit of protection, waterproofing
in the chief's thatched hut

00:24:43.583 --> 00:24:46.160
which would be a very
reasonable and desirable

00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:48.216
use for it from the chief's point of view,

00:24:48.216 --> 00:24:50.405
or did it have some other use?

00:24:50.405 --> 00:24:53.046
Okay the results of this very,

00:24:53.046 --> 00:24:56.511
first of all just massively
ambitious project,

00:24:56.511 --> 00:25:00.151
way beyond anything we normally
do in democracy building

00:25:00.151 --> 00:25:02.930
and just way beyond what you
could afford to do actually,

00:25:02.930 --> 00:25:06.113
incredibly intense, expensive project.

00:25:06.113 --> 00:25:08.360
What were the results?

00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:12.789
The first answer is that
there was no difference

00:25:12.789 --> 00:25:16.150
between the experimental
and control villages.

00:25:16.150 --> 00:25:20.769
So three and a half years of
effort made no difference.

00:25:20.769 --> 00:25:23.945
Fostering new participatory institutions

00:25:23.945 --> 00:25:26.785
had apparently had no effect.

00:25:26.785 --> 00:25:30.065
But perhaps more interesting
is who did make decisions

00:25:30.065 --> 00:25:32.416
and what decisions were made in both

00:25:32.416 --> 00:25:35.165
the experimental and control villages?

00:25:35.165 --> 00:25:37.541
In both sorts of villages most villagers

00:25:37.541 --> 00:25:40.194
of the public goods game gave all

00:25:40.194 --> 00:25:42.694
their money to the common pot.

00:25:44.069 --> 00:25:47.236
So Sierra Leone may have been war-torn

00:25:48.419 --> 00:25:50.097
but it was not a place in which

00:25:50.097 --> 00:25:53.057
people did not feel obligated

00:25:53.057 --> 00:25:55.183
and my hunch there's some other research

00:25:55.183 --> 00:25:57.016
that would suggest pressure from the chief

00:25:57.016 --> 00:25:59.745
is what led people to
contribute to the common pot

00:25:59.745 --> 00:26:03.362
not selflessness, but
nonetheless the effect was

00:26:03.362 --> 00:26:07.529
that people gave very substantial
amounts to the common pot.

00:26:09.324 --> 00:26:10.711
When it came to choosing between

00:26:10.711 --> 00:26:12.464
the batteries and the bags of salt

00:26:12.464 --> 00:26:15.101
the chief chose, there
was no participation,

00:26:15.101 --> 00:26:19.017
no gender, no nothing,
the chiefs just chose.

00:26:19.017 --> 00:26:21.984
The tarp left behind
however did not end up

00:26:21.984 --> 00:26:24.385
keeping the rain out of the chief's hut.

00:26:24.385 --> 00:26:26.415
Rather when researchers
returned to the village

00:26:26.415 --> 00:26:28.406
months later they found that in both

00:26:28.406 --> 00:26:30.273
experimental and control villages

00:26:30.273 --> 00:26:32.734
the tarps had been shared by village women

00:26:32.734 --> 00:26:36.086
used to bleach their grain in the sun.

00:26:36.086 --> 00:26:37.821
Similarly the items purchased with

00:26:37.821 --> 00:26:39.527
the hardware store vouchers had been used

00:26:39.527 --> 00:26:43.123
for village projects, so
perhaps the new institutions

00:26:43.123 --> 00:26:46.357
didn't take root because chiefs,

00:26:46.357 --> 00:26:48.399
the institution of chieftaincy

00:26:48.399 --> 00:26:51.649
was already producing collective goods.

00:26:53.001 --> 00:26:56.661
And we have to ask why the NGO assumed

00:26:56.661 --> 00:26:59.862
that participatory, gender, egalitarian,

00:26:59.862 --> 00:27:02.772
decision making would
be a vast improvement

00:27:02.772 --> 00:27:05.716
over what these villages already had.

00:27:05.716 --> 00:27:09.310
Now I want to talk about a second study

00:27:09.310 --> 00:27:11.411
by sociologist Stephen Cornell

00:27:11.411 --> 00:27:14.146
and an economist Joseph Kalt.

00:27:14.146 --> 00:27:16.299
In a similarly ambitious project

00:27:16.299 --> 00:27:18.267
they compared economic development

00:27:18.267 --> 00:27:21.646
across more than 60
Native American tribes.

00:27:21.646 --> 00:27:22.980
And I have to say this was another

00:27:22.980 --> 00:27:25.621
just remarkably ambitious project.

00:27:25.621 --> 00:27:27.648
They were at Harvard and they got students

00:27:27.648 --> 00:27:29.813
from the Harvard Business School to serve

00:27:29.813 --> 00:27:32.954
as consultants to reservation communities

00:27:32.954 --> 00:27:35.298
that requested their help and they went

00:27:35.298 --> 00:27:40.106
for minimum of six months,
recorded a vast battery

00:27:40.106 --> 00:27:42.216
of economic data and offered whatever

00:27:42.216 --> 00:27:44.453
consulting services they could offer

00:27:44.453 --> 00:27:47.441
about managing the
tribe's economic welfare.

00:27:47.441 --> 00:27:50.158
So this was a sort of
exchange of research data

00:27:50.158 --> 00:27:51.912
for consulting help and of course it was

00:27:51.912 --> 00:27:56.281
great experience for these
essentially internships

00:27:56.281 --> 00:27:59.072
offered to these Harvard
Business School students.

00:27:59.072 --> 00:28:02.319
All right, they found first and this is

00:28:02.319 --> 00:28:04.447
a very, very strong finding that tribes

00:28:04.447 --> 00:28:08.341
economic fortunes this was
the era before casinos,

00:28:08.341 --> 00:28:10.269
so I actually don't know
how you would measure

00:28:10.269 --> 00:28:14.362
this effectively now, but
tribes economic fortunes

00:28:14.362 --> 00:28:17.355
differed radically depending on how well

00:28:17.355 --> 00:28:20.935
they were governed not on
their natural resources,

00:28:20.935 --> 00:28:22.368
local labor market conditions,

00:28:22.368 --> 00:28:24.906
or any other advantages or disadvantages

00:28:24.906 --> 00:28:27.556
of their objective economic situation.

00:28:27.556 --> 00:28:31.286
Tribes that were well-governed
were economically successful.

00:28:31.286 --> 00:28:34.781
Those that were poorly
governed failed economically

00:28:34.781 --> 00:28:37.751
even when they had enormously rich

00:28:37.751 --> 00:28:39.933
natural resources for example.

00:28:39.933 --> 00:28:42.890
What then accounted for
better or worse governance?

00:28:42.890 --> 00:28:46.486
In a stunning paper
titled, Where's the Glue?

00:28:46.486 --> 00:28:49.759
Cornell and Kalt show
that well-governed tribes

00:28:49.759 --> 00:28:53.604
had governance structures
that corresponded roughly

00:28:53.604 --> 00:28:56.436
to the governance structures
Europeans recorded

00:28:56.436 --> 00:28:59.103
at first contact with the group.

00:29:01.633 --> 00:29:04.036
Institutions that
corresponded to long-standing

00:29:04.036 --> 00:29:06.033
cultural patterns were most effective

00:29:06.033 --> 00:29:07.914
at creating collective goods.

00:29:07.914 --> 00:29:10.131
A tribe governed at first contact by

00:29:10.131 --> 00:29:13.464
a self-perpetuating group of six shamans

00:29:14.555 --> 00:29:17.130
that was currently
governed by a self-selected

00:29:17.130 --> 00:29:19.057
group of Shamans who simply chose

00:29:19.057 --> 00:29:22.802
their own successors was well-governed.

00:29:22.802 --> 00:29:25.085
A tribe that at first contact was governed

00:29:25.085 --> 00:29:28.144
by an elected tribal
council that was still run

00:29:28.144 --> 00:29:32.027
by an elected tribal
council was well-governed.

00:29:32.027 --> 00:29:33.851
But when a tribe that at first contact

00:29:33.851 --> 00:29:37.685
was run by a single chief
who had centralized authority

00:29:37.685 --> 00:29:42.317
was no governed by an elected
council it was poorly governed

00:29:42.317 --> 00:29:44.894
with tribal elections frequently settled

00:29:44.894 --> 00:29:49.891
when one faction ran another
out of office with guns.

00:29:49.891 --> 00:29:52.776
So for reasons we don't fully understand,

00:29:52.776 --> 00:29:55.746
institutions with
long-embedded cultural history

00:29:55.746 --> 00:29:58.169
seem to produce better
governance than what

00:29:58.169 --> 00:30:01.942
we might think of as the best institutions

00:30:01.942 --> 00:30:04.754
however well they might
function in theory.

00:30:04.754 --> 00:30:07.570
I could say much more about
Cornell and Kalt's work.

00:30:07.570 --> 00:30:10.826
Why a shaman thought it
would be beneath his dignity

00:30:10.826 --> 00:30:14.384
to appoint a relative
to an important post,

00:30:14.384 --> 00:30:17.838
or how a Potawatomi group
managed its forest resources

00:30:17.838 --> 00:30:19.246
more effectively than did the

00:30:19.246 --> 00:30:22.232
giant lumber company warehouser.

00:30:22.232 --> 00:30:24.326
But the bottom line is
the somewhat mysterious

00:30:24.326 --> 00:30:27.567
but very important finding even when there

00:30:27.567 --> 00:30:30.399
had been significant
interruptions in groups

00:30:30.399 --> 00:30:32.200
historical patterns of governance,

00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:35.464
so they are not saying that six shamans

00:30:35.464 --> 00:30:38.255
governed this group and governed it

00:30:38.255 --> 00:30:41.449
continuously from time immemorial.

00:30:41.449 --> 00:30:43.352
In fact all these groups had enormous

00:30:43.352 --> 00:30:45.726
interruptions in governance partly because

00:30:45.726 --> 00:30:48.646
the US Government Bureau of Indian Affairs

00:30:48.646 --> 00:30:52.696
imposed one common model
on all American tribes

00:30:52.696 --> 00:30:55.072
for a period of about 40 years

00:30:55.072 --> 00:30:58.115
and then it relented and let tribes

00:30:58.115 --> 00:31:00.980
choose a variety of different
organizational patterns.

00:31:00.980 --> 00:31:05.116
But also there had been
almost unimaginable

00:31:05.116 --> 00:31:08.071
disruptions in all these
groups forms of social life.

00:31:08.071 --> 00:31:11.449
So the federal policy
forced them to redefine

00:31:11.449 --> 00:31:14.155
themselves as tribes
whatever their historic forms

00:31:14.155 --> 00:31:16.291
of social organization were,

00:31:16.291 --> 00:31:18.398
competing bands were forced to merge

00:31:18.398 --> 00:31:19.957
in order to negotiate effectively

00:31:19.957 --> 00:31:21.701
with the federal government,

00:31:21.701 --> 00:31:23.663
and of course populations were decimated

00:31:23.663 --> 00:31:26.686
by disease and slaughter,
displaced from their lands

00:31:26.686 --> 00:31:30.071
and often subjected to cultural genocide.

00:31:30.071 --> 00:31:33.518
Nonetheless, institutions function better

00:31:33.518 --> 00:31:35.841
when they corresponded
to long-established,

00:31:35.841 --> 00:31:39.276
even if interrupted, cultural models.

00:31:39.276 --> 00:31:41.581
But must we draw the conclusion that

00:31:41.581 --> 00:31:45.042
good institutions are
necessarily an ancient legacy

00:31:45.042 --> 00:31:47.469
worked out over many generations and that

00:31:47.469 --> 00:31:49.477
the heritage that makes
for good institutions

00:31:49.477 --> 00:31:52.332
is so complex that it is almost impossible

00:31:52.332 --> 00:31:55.114
to rebuild since we now understand

00:31:55.114 --> 00:31:58.565
how fragile even our institutions are?

00:31:58.565 --> 00:32:01.607
This would be a truly
frightening prospect.

00:32:01.607 --> 00:32:03.993
So creating good institutions.

00:32:03.993 --> 00:32:05.785
I now want to turn this argument around

00:32:05.785 --> 00:32:08.027
by considering some of
the surprising features

00:32:08.027 --> 00:32:11.751
of good institutions that I've observed

00:32:11.751 --> 00:32:14.146
during my work in sub-Saharan Africa

00:32:14.146 --> 00:32:18.023
and that other scholars have also examined

00:32:18.023 --> 00:32:22.015
to see whether they have
lessons relevant for today.

00:32:22.015 --> 00:32:26.237
First, I want to talk about
reinventing African chieftaincy.

00:32:26.237 --> 00:32:29.806
Across sub-Saharan Africa
chiefs and chieftaincy

00:32:29.806 --> 00:32:33.147
often delegitimated and in places outlawed

00:32:33.147 --> 00:32:36.875
due to chiefs collaboration
with colonial authorities

00:32:36.875 --> 00:32:39.845
has come roaring back with
Afrobarometer survey data

00:32:39.845 --> 00:32:42.941
from across Africa showing
that traditional leaders

00:32:42.941 --> 00:32:45.642
are the most trusted,
more than legislators

00:32:45.642 --> 00:32:47.865
or government officials of all types.

00:32:47.865 --> 00:32:50.547
Recent research from
Zambia a wonderful book

00:32:50.547 --> 00:32:53.780
by Kate Baldwin, political scientist,

00:32:53.780 --> 00:32:55.532
has shown that chiefs
help their communities

00:32:55.532 --> 00:32:58.001
produce collective goods of all sorts.

00:32:58.001 --> 00:32:59.954
Wells for clean water, roads, schools

00:32:59.954 --> 00:33:04.359
and attracting development
projects to their villages.

00:33:04.359 --> 00:33:07.169
Why are they able to do this and how?

00:33:07.169 --> 00:33:11.250
One surprising answer has
to do with time horizons.

00:33:11.250 --> 00:33:15.395
Chiefs do a fairly good
job because they have

00:33:15.395 --> 00:33:19.871
very long time horizons, their
positions are hereditary,

00:33:19.871 --> 00:33:23.595
not elected, and here I'll
just say as a parenthesis

00:33:23.595 --> 00:33:27.661
that's true although at the
time of a chiefly succession

00:33:27.661 --> 00:33:30.958
when an old chief dies the royal family

00:33:30.958 --> 00:33:33.127
will have some negotiation and somebody

00:33:33.127 --> 00:33:36.607
who's manifestly incompetent
might be pushed aside,

00:33:36.607 --> 00:33:39.107
someone who is more respected,

00:33:41.314 --> 00:33:43.391
so the royal family
itself has an investment

00:33:43.391 --> 00:33:45.622
in the continuity of its leadership

00:33:45.622 --> 00:33:48.123
and tries to put forward, I think,

00:33:48.123 --> 00:33:50.375
generally more competent people.

00:33:50.375 --> 00:33:53.375
Chiefs are also occasionally deposed

00:33:54.212 --> 00:33:56.364
if they are truly corrupt or incompetent,

00:33:56.364 --> 00:33:59.029
but that is usually done
by the royal family itself.

00:33:59.029 --> 00:34:01.862
That is the chiefly lineage group,

00:34:02.954 --> 00:34:06.630
yeah that would be called
locally the royal family.

00:34:06.630 --> 00:34:08.621
All right, in their positions for life

00:34:08.621 --> 00:34:10.757
chiefs see their own
well-being as identified

00:34:10.757 --> 00:34:13.027
with that of their
communities and they have

00:34:13.027 --> 00:34:15.457
a very long time horizon.

00:34:15.457 --> 00:34:18.092
Contrast this with the
ever shorter time horizons

00:34:18.092 --> 00:34:20.438
of our current institutions.

00:34:20.438 --> 00:34:23.807
I refer not only to term
limiting our legislators

00:34:23.807 --> 00:34:26.494
but also to the implications
of share-holder value

00:34:26.494 --> 00:34:29.368
for corporate governance
so that corporate boards

00:34:29.368 --> 00:34:31.655
are legally mandated
to put the performance

00:34:31.655 --> 00:34:34.151
of a corporation's stock inevitably

00:34:34.151 --> 00:34:37.442
a short-term indicator
above any consideration

00:34:37.442 --> 00:34:39.961
of the long-term endowments
of the corporation,

00:34:39.961 --> 00:34:43.712
such as loyalty and accumulated
skills of its workforce,

00:34:43.712 --> 00:34:47.485
investment in long-term
research and development,

00:34:47.485 --> 00:34:50.433
or long-term commitment
to a local community.

00:34:50.433 --> 00:34:53.691
The Wells Fargo scandal isn't just about

00:34:53.691 --> 00:34:56.657
terrible management at one gigantic bank.

00:34:56.657 --> 00:34:59.796
But about the very short
time horizon of executives

00:34:59.796 --> 00:35:02.251
whose astronomical bonuses are tied

00:35:02.251 --> 00:35:05.330
to short-term performance,
sometimes only to performance

00:35:05.330 --> 00:35:08.330
for one quarter, that's three months

00:35:09.265 --> 00:35:11.251
in a corporation stock price.

00:35:11.251 --> 00:35:14.849
This is mafia territory where
mergers and acquisitions

00:35:14.849 --> 00:35:18.605
can mean taking over a
business with a large endowment

00:35:18.605 --> 00:35:22.772
of skills, patents, land,
factories, or brand name

00:35:24.626 --> 00:35:26.951
selling off the most valuable bits,

00:35:26.951 --> 00:35:28.875
driving up short-term profitability

00:35:28.875 --> 00:35:30.795
by drastically cuttings costs usually

00:35:30.795 --> 00:35:33.164
by laying-off workers at the cost of

00:35:33.164 --> 00:35:35.284
longer-term performance and selling out

00:35:35.284 --> 00:35:37.490
before the market catches on

00:35:37.490 --> 00:35:40.101
leaving the hollowed out wreckage.

00:35:40.101 --> 00:35:42.273
This isn't just a matter
of corporate crooks

00:35:42.273 --> 00:35:44.564
who should be prosecuted,
although my brother

00:35:44.564 --> 00:35:46.476
used to say, only half joking,

00:35:46.476 --> 00:35:48.369
"That such crimes made him reconsider

00:35:48.369 --> 00:35:50.726
"his opposition to the death penalty."

00:35:50.726 --> 00:35:53.084
Such changes are a
consequence of the broader

00:35:53.084 --> 00:35:56.709
institutional order in
this case the redefinition

00:35:56.709 --> 00:35:58.805
of the legal and regulatory environment

00:35:58.805 --> 00:36:02.837
within which corporations
worked after the 1980s.

00:36:02.837 --> 00:36:06.418
As when we redefine the ease of divorce

00:36:06.418 --> 00:36:09.466
or the terms of our legislators,

00:36:09.466 --> 00:36:13.383
we alter an institution
and its terms including

00:36:15.984 --> 00:36:19.984
its taken for granted
extension forward in time.

00:36:22.743 --> 00:36:24.989
Universities are unusual in this respect

00:36:24.989 --> 00:36:27.606
in that many of their
members especially alumni

00:36:27.606 --> 00:36:31.285
and many tenured faculty have lifelong

00:36:31.285 --> 00:36:33.882
not short-term investments
in the institution,

00:36:33.882 --> 00:36:36.193
its reputation and its future.

00:36:36.193 --> 00:36:39.391
But the politicians who
control the university's fate

00:36:39.391 --> 00:36:41.352
inevitably have the same short-term

00:36:41.352 --> 00:36:45.162
pressures and incentives to
please current constituents,

00:36:45.162 --> 00:36:48.090
admit more students, don't raise tuition,

00:36:48.090 --> 00:36:51.050
don't raise taxes, that
make long-term investments

00:36:51.050 --> 00:36:53.500
so difficult throughout our society.

00:36:53.500 --> 00:36:55.329
And of course the contrast between

00:36:55.329 --> 00:36:59.288
political institutions defined
by short-term incentives

00:36:59.288 --> 00:37:01.825
and I should say by national boundaries

00:37:01.825 --> 00:37:04.401
and the very long time horizon required

00:37:04.401 --> 00:37:08.570
to combat climate change
are tragically evident.

00:37:08.570 --> 00:37:11.163
Okay, now I want to
turn to another element

00:37:11.163 --> 00:37:14.663
of good institutions besides time horizons

00:37:16.523 --> 00:37:20.690
and talk about status
hierarchies and ritual forms.

00:37:22.529 --> 00:37:24.817
I already described how institutions with

00:37:24.817 --> 00:37:27.870
deep cultural roots function better

00:37:27.870 --> 00:37:32.166
and are more likely to
be good in my terms.

00:37:32.166 --> 00:37:34.024
The question is why and whether these

00:37:34.024 --> 00:37:35.997
insights can be carried forward

00:37:35.997 --> 00:37:40.107
to build or reinforce our
own institutional capacities?

00:37:40.107 --> 00:37:44.380
Sociologists often discuss
an institution's legitimacy

00:37:44.380 --> 00:37:46.834
which I recall something
like the cultural belief

00:37:46.834 --> 00:37:49.644
that the institution is the
right kind of institution

00:37:49.644 --> 00:37:51.924
and that it's basically good.

00:37:51.924 --> 00:37:54.015
But it's hard to make a convincing case,

00:37:54.015 --> 00:37:56.422
at least in my view, that people's belief

00:37:56.422 --> 00:37:58.554
in the goodness or rightness
of their institutions

00:37:58.554 --> 00:38:02.270
is enough to overcome the
inertia, indifference,

00:38:02.270 --> 00:38:06.227
and selfishness, what political scientists

00:38:06.227 --> 00:38:08.839
and others call, the free rider problem,

00:38:08.839 --> 00:38:13.317
which can lead even say
socially committed people

00:38:13.317 --> 00:38:16.374
to burn out when others don't pitch in.

00:38:16.374 --> 00:38:19.208
Legitimacy is particularly
difficult to demonstrate

00:38:19.208 --> 00:38:23.208
as an important feature
of institutional success

00:38:24.646 --> 00:38:28.450
given that most people are quite cynical

00:38:28.450 --> 00:38:30.743
even about institutions upon which

00:38:30.743 --> 00:38:33.628
they depend and with which they cooperate.

00:38:33.628 --> 00:38:36.345
That is I think a sweetness and light

00:38:36.345 --> 00:38:40.124
institutions survive and are healthy

00:38:40.124 --> 00:38:42.560
because everyone loves
them and believes in them

00:38:42.560 --> 00:38:45.707
I just don't think we
have evidence that's true.

00:38:45.707 --> 00:38:48.256
So if legitimacy isn't the main reason

00:38:48.256 --> 00:38:51.536
why shared culture matters, why and how

00:38:51.536 --> 00:38:54.752
does culture matter for institutions?

00:38:54.752 --> 00:38:56.918
And here I want to talk
about another fascinating

00:38:56.918 --> 00:39:00.128
study of villagers in rural China

00:39:00.128 --> 00:39:02.367
that suggests one possible reason.

00:39:02.367 --> 00:39:04.831
Lily Tsai who originally
was a graduate student

00:39:04.831 --> 00:39:07.778
here in political science,
although I didn't know her,

00:39:07.778 --> 00:39:10.387
studied more than 300 villages in both

00:39:10.387 --> 00:39:13.881
poor and wealthy regions of China.

00:39:13.881 --> 00:39:16.952
As we found for the Native American tribes

00:39:16.952 --> 00:39:19.388
wealth did not predict whether villages

00:39:19.388 --> 00:39:24.238
provided such collective goods
as roads, repaired paths,

00:39:24.238 --> 00:39:27.680
elementary school classrooms,
and running water.

00:39:27.680 --> 00:39:30.529
Whether village magistrates
were top-down appointees

00:39:30.529 --> 00:39:35.126
or formerly democratically
elected didn't matter either.

00:39:35.126 --> 00:39:36.972
What predicted public goods provision

00:39:36.972 --> 00:39:39.731
was instead whether or not the village

00:39:39.731 --> 00:39:42.402
had a traditional cultural association,

00:39:42.402 --> 00:39:46.569
a village temple committee, or
a village wide lineage group

00:39:47.897 --> 00:39:50.000
that both, and these are her terms,

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:53.890
encompassed and embedded
village officials.

00:39:53.890 --> 00:39:56.316
That is the village officials had

00:39:56.316 --> 00:39:58.858
to be part of such a group and that group

00:39:58.858 --> 00:40:02.154
had to encompass most of the village.

00:40:02.154 --> 00:40:05.128
So Tsai's argument is
that these traditional

00:40:05.128 --> 00:40:08.058
cultural associations provided a place

00:40:08.058 --> 00:40:11.666
where officials could receive status,

00:40:11.666 --> 00:40:14.083
admiration, gratitude, honor,

00:40:15.448 --> 00:40:19.281
for accomplishments that
benefited the village

00:40:20.989 --> 00:40:24.924
and this status in turn
provided those leaders resources

00:40:24.924 --> 00:40:27.560
with which to win cooperation
from other members

00:40:27.560 --> 00:40:30.846
of the village community
for collective projects.

00:40:30.846 --> 00:40:35.037
In a sense status, or what
Tsai calls, moral standing,

00:40:35.037 --> 00:40:36.373
so you have to accomplish things that

00:40:36.373 --> 00:40:40.037
people believe are good
provides, a reason why

00:40:40.037 --> 00:40:44.204
chiefs, mayors, or university
deans and department chairs

00:40:45.098 --> 00:40:47.908
may define their on well-being
by how their community

00:40:47.908 --> 00:40:50.461
regards them and also why they may be

00:40:50.461 --> 00:40:53.031
able to win cooperation from others.

00:40:53.031 --> 00:40:56.039
Tsai writes quote, "Moral standing can be

00:40:56.039 --> 00:40:57.943
"a powerful incentive.

00:40:57.943 --> 00:41:01.078
"It not only makes people
feel good about themselves

00:41:01.078 --> 00:41:02.870
"but also it can translate into

00:41:02.870 --> 00:41:05.228
"economic and social advancement.

00:41:05.228 --> 00:41:07.452
"Local officials with
higher moral standing

00:41:07.452 --> 00:41:09.326
"may also find it easier to illicit

00:41:09.326 --> 00:41:12.252
"citizen compliance with state policies.

00:41:12.252 --> 00:41:15.025
"Moral standing can be
an invaluable resource

00:41:15.025 --> 00:41:16.653
"for accomplishing a variety of

00:41:16.653 --> 00:41:20.495
"political, social and
economic objectives."

00:41:20.495 --> 00:41:23.502
Tsai uses a made up American analogy

00:41:23.502 --> 00:41:26.710
to try to explain her
argument about rural China.

00:41:26.710 --> 00:41:28.837
She says, "Imagine the
mayor of a small town

00:41:28.837 --> 00:41:31.775
"in the United States
with only one church.

00:41:31.775 --> 00:41:34.172
"Even if not everyone
goes to church regularly

00:41:34.172 --> 00:41:35.558
"everyone sees the church as

00:41:35.558 --> 00:41:38.246
"representative of the town community.

00:41:38.246 --> 00:41:40.908
"In this kind of small town
if the mayor does something

00:41:40.908 --> 00:41:43.619
"exemplary that benefits the town

00:41:43.619 --> 00:41:46.470
"the minister might very
well mention his good work

00:41:46.470 --> 00:41:50.287
"in front of the congregation
during Sunday sermon.

00:41:50.287 --> 00:41:52.234
"This in turn can give the mayor a measure

00:41:52.234 --> 00:41:55.100
"of moral and social
standing in addition to

00:41:55.100 --> 00:41:56.884
"whatever he might already possess

00:41:56.884 --> 00:42:00.123
"as a public official or a
member of the social elite.

00:42:00.123 --> 00:42:02.164
"Increased moral standing
may also make his

00:42:02.164 --> 00:42:05.115
"mayoral tasks easier to carry out.

00:42:05.115 --> 00:42:08.970
"When he tries to implement
a difficult state policy

00:42:08.970 --> 00:42:10.874
"a new requirement for
example that students

00:42:10.874 --> 00:42:12.406
"of a different ethnic group be bused

00:42:12.406 --> 00:42:15.533
"into the town school,
additional standing can help

00:42:15.533 --> 00:42:18.316
"him persuade his constituents."

00:42:18.316 --> 00:42:21.166
And she literally has in mind

00:42:21.166 --> 00:42:23.423
minister goes up to some
leader in the town says,

00:42:23.423 --> 00:42:26.170
"Look I hope I have you with me on this."

00:42:26.170 --> 00:42:29.612
And if that mayor has a lot of status

00:42:29.612 --> 00:42:32.213
people defer and say, "Oh
yeah, yeah, I'll be with you.

00:42:32.213 --> 00:42:33.838
"You can count on me."

00:42:33.838 --> 00:42:35.432
That's what she's talking about.

00:42:35.432 --> 00:42:37.127
Moral standing can make citizens

00:42:37.127 --> 00:42:39.601
more likely to trust the mayor

00:42:39.601 --> 00:42:42.371
and defer to his judgment and can win over

00:42:42.371 --> 00:42:45.437
particularly stubborn
opponents of the policy.

00:42:45.437 --> 00:42:47.647
We of course are increasingly skeptical

00:42:47.647 --> 00:42:49.529
of status inequalities.

00:42:49.529 --> 00:42:53.256
At least since the 1960s,
and not only in the US,

00:42:53.256 --> 00:42:56.316
survey after survey has
shown growing public distrust

00:42:56.316 --> 00:42:59.291
of elites of all sorts,
business executives,

00:42:59.291 --> 00:43:02.037
government officials,
physicians, and of course

00:43:02.037 --> 00:43:05.284
the scientists whose authority we need

00:43:05.284 --> 00:43:08.610
to affirm the reality of
human caused climate change.

00:43:08.610 --> 00:43:11.500
Amidst rising inequality
and wealth and income

00:43:11.500 --> 00:43:14.143
we have flattened the prestige hierarchy,

00:43:14.143 --> 00:43:16.802
so that fewer people
command public deferences

00:43:16.802 --> 00:43:19.850
and public trust it
comes as little surprise

00:43:19.850 --> 00:43:23.495
that fewer are drawn to public service.

00:43:23.495 --> 00:43:26.032
Noblesse oblige is a thing of the past,

00:43:26.032 --> 00:43:28.199
no noblesse and no oblige.

00:43:29.844 --> 00:43:31.506
The new status elite are perhaps those

00:43:31.506 --> 00:43:34.176
tech billionaires who
establish foundations,

00:43:34.176 --> 00:43:36.580
but this is a remarkably self-indulgent,

00:43:36.580 --> 00:43:39.131
undemocratic, and in many ways strikingly

00:43:39.131 --> 00:43:42.634
apolitical form of social commitment.

00:43:42.634 --> 00:43:45.183
And of course the
billionaires who intervene

00:43:45.183 --> 00:43:48.358
directly in politics like the
Koch brothers on the right,

00:43:48.358 --> 00:43:50.419
and Buffett and Soros on the left,

00:43:50.419 --> 00:43:53.588
are hardly greeted with
deference and gratitude.

00:43:53.588 --> 00:43:55.950
But we should not forget that status,

00:43:55.950 --> 00:43:59.370
moral standing, is a powerful reward.

00:43:59.370 --> 00:44:01.872
Global institutions and
the humbler institutions

00:44:01.872 --> 00:44:03.390
within which we live and work

00:44:03.390 --> 00:44:05.593
would do well to remember its value

00:44:05.593 --> 00:44:08.698
as a stored reservoir
of social commitments.

00:44:08.698 --> 00:44:13.267
And in my own work in Africa
you can see very clearly

00:44:13.267 --> 00:44:16.610
that chiefs have status and they receive

00:44:16.610 --> 00:44:18.589
a lot of deference when I had to go meet

00:44:18.589 --> 00:44:21.225
one of their various levels of chiefs,

00:44:21.225 --> 00:44:23.832
but anyways I had to go
meet one of the big ones.

00:44:23.832 --> 00:44:27.110
There was massive amount of attention to

00:44:27.110 --> 00:44:28.604
everyone had to bathe carefully,

00:44:28.604 --> 00:44:30.595
and wear pressed clothes,

00:44:30.595 --> 00:44:32.365
and had to bring a small gift,

00:44:32.365 --> 00:44:34.931
and there's the how,
what would we discuss.

00:44:34.931 --> 00:44:38.500
Every aspect of this was,
there was as much concern

00:44:38.500 --> 00:44:40.933
as Ellen Gobler has shown
in getting every element

00:44:40.933 --> 00:44:45.165
of this lecture together
for my visit to the chief.

00:44:45.165 --> 00:44:47.644
And then it turns out that what chiefs do

00:44:47.644 --> 00:44:49.257
what do they actually do,

00:44:49.257 --> 00:44:51.783
since they have no physical authority?

00:44:51.783 --> 00:44:52.845
They don't have police.

00:44:52.845 --> 00:44:54.082
They don't have guns.

00:44:54.082 --> 00:44:55.554
They don't have troops.

00:44:55.554 --> 00:44:56.773
They don't have enforcers.

00:44:56.773 --> 00:44:59.538
They really just totally
rely on their moral authority

00:44:59.538 --> 00:45:04.331
to make many, many, very,
very important decisions.

00:45:04.331 --> 00:45:08.248
Well turns out that when
someone is known to be

00:45:10.792 --> 00:45:12.824
an upstanding member of the community

00:45:12.824 --> 00:45:14.091
they actually there's a phrase

00:45:14.091 --> 00:45:17.424
in Chichewa that says, worth not wealth.

00:45:20.018 --> 00:45:23.989
That person is then the
chief treats that person

00:45:23.989 --> 00:45:26.937
in an important way if a member
of that person's family dies

00:45:26.937 --> 00:45:29.166
the chief comes in person to give a speech

00:45:29.166 --> 00:45:31.669
at the funeral rather
than deputing one of his

00:45:31.669 --> 00:45:34.390
many councilors and so on and so forth.

00:45:34.390 --> 00:45:38.989
If that person there may be
benefits to be handed out

00:45:38.989 --> 00:45:40.404
and this person who's known to be

00:45:40.404 --> 00:45:42.040
a good contributor to the community

00:45:42.040 --> 00:45:44.928
might get extra one of these benefits.

00:45:44.928 --> 00:45:46.954
But in general you can think of these

00:45:46.954 --> 00:45:50.138
high status people like
chiefs as operating

00:45:50.138 --> 00:45:53.455
as a kind of reservoir
of social commitment,

00:45:53.455 --> 00:45:57.205
so that the social
commitments build up their

00:45:59.266 --> 00:46:02.869
reservoir of influence and then they use

00:46:02.869 --> 00:46:05.940
that influence to reward
people who in turn

00:46:05.940 --> 00:46:07.892
build up their reservoir of influence.

00:46:07.892 --> 00:46:10.589
It's a very recognizable pattern

00:46:10.589 --> 00:46:12.922
and it flows through status.

00:46:14.542 --> 00:46:18.709
Okay, then another aspect of
this and it's tied to status

00:46:19.779 --> 00:46:22.712
has to do with the role of rituals,

00:46:22.712 --> 00:46:26.795
and I think these traditional,
cultural practices

00:46:28.755 --> 00:46:32.935
matter partly because they
create collectively recognized

00:46:32.935 --> 00:46:36.167
ritual occasions and I
think we tend to be cynical

00:46:36.167 --> 00:46:39.798
about rituals we're cosmopolitan elites.

00:46:39.798 --> 00:46:42.179
Although I hope you will still recognize

00:46:42.179 --> 00:46:45.506
the world I'm talking about where

00:46:45.506 --> 00:46:46.852
there are shared rituals,

00:46:46.852 --> 00:46:50.097
think here of an annual
PTA meeting or a church,

00:46:50.097 --> 00:46:51.571
or in my case the ritual life

00:46:51.571 --> 00:46:54.461
with my own academic department,

00:46:54.461 --> 00:46:56.396
and I'll say my synagogue.

00:46:56.396 --> 00:46:58.822
It really matters whether
we have an occasion

00:46:58.822 --> 00:47:01.876
to celebrate the
achievements of our members,

00:47:01.876 --> 00:47:06.247
to thank those, for example,
who served as department chair,

00:47:06.247 --> 00:47:08.319
or others who've served
the university or who have

00:47:08.319 --> 00:47:11.980
lived up to ideals of scholarship,
teaching or mentorship.

00:47:11.980 --> 00:47:13.549
Indeed that is part of what

00:47:13.549 --> 00:47:16.466
remembering Bernard Moses is about.

00:47:17.891 --> 00:47:19.835
Such rituals serve many functions.

00:47:19.835 --> 00:47:21.653
They build solidarity.

00:47:21.653 --> 00:47:24.840
They allow people to
deliver the status honor,

00:47:24.840 --> 00:47:27.955
to publicly affirm the moral standing

00:47:27.955 --> 00:47:30.407
of those who contribute to the community.

00:47:30.407 --> 00:47:33.185
But also very importantly
when people thank

00:47:33.185 --> 00:47:36.566
those who have contributed
to the collective

00:47:36.566 --> 00:47:40.834
they enhance the sense of the
value of the group itself.

00:47:40.834 --> 00:47:43.575
And I was very aware of this, this year.

00:47:43.575 --> 00:47:45.271
I was thinking about such things at our

00:47:45.271 --> 00:47:48.365
big department graduation
ceremony each spring

00:47:48.365 --> 00:47:50.263
as we celebrate the graduates,

00:47:50.263 --> 00:47:53.520
we also celebrate our department

00:47:53.520 --> 00:47:56.184
and the fundamental value of
our teaching and research.

00:47:56.184 --> 00:47:59.624
We publicly thank and praise each other,

00:47:59.624 --> 00:48:04.004
and we thus emphasize, we
create and reiterate a narrative

00:48:04.004 --> 00:48:07.851
in which we are all
doing our share and more

00:48:07.851 --> 00:48:11.080
to carry out our responsibility
for the institution.

00:48:11.080 --> 00:48:15.021
We thus minimize the
awareness of free riders,

00:48:15.021 --> 00:48:16.525
who might undermine the commitment

00:48:16.525 --> 00:48:18.560
of everyone else to contribute.

00:48:18.560 --> 00:48:22.109
That is we create the
illusion that we are getting

00:48:22.109 --> 00:48:24.309
more contributions for more broader range

00:48:24.309 --> 00:48:27.466
of our members than we
perhaps really are getting,

00:48:27.466 --> 00:48:31.129
and we therefore minimize the visibility

00:48:31.129 --> 00:48:34.793
of the free riders and
maximize the visibility

00:48:34.793 --> 00:48:37.400
and the status of those who do contribute

00:48:37.400 --> 00:48:39.034
and the extraordinary value

00:48:39.034 --> 00:48:41.231
of the thing they contribute to.

00:48:41.231 --> 00:48:43.784
So my department is very big on ritual,

00:48:43.784 --> 00:48:45.678
I'm happy to say, I
think it has to do a lot

00:48:45.678 --> 00:48:49.074
with having a lot of
female chairs, been great.

00:48:49.074 --> 00:48:51.512
And we have had many,
many occasions where,

00:48:51.512 --> 00:48:55.556
for example, if a
department member receives

00:48:55.556 --> 00:48:59.047
almost any honor we have
a department reception

00:48:59.047 --> 00:49:00.869
to honor the person and we talk about

00:49:00.869 --> 00:49:02.669
how great that person is and we all feel,

00:49:02.669 --> 00:49:05.898
wow I'm so lucky to be in a department

00:49:05.898 --> 00:49:09.497
with such a terrific person and that

00:49:09.497 --> 00:49:12.841
that person's prestige one
of our department members

00:49:12.841 --> 00:49:15.343
was knighted by the Norwegian government

00:49:15.343 --> 00:49:18.656
and so we felt wow we have a knight

00:49:18.656 --> 00:49:21.952
in our department, that's fantastic.

00:49:21.952 --> 00:49:25.535
And so we absorbed his
honor into ourselves

00:49:26.802 --> 00:49:30.446
and we elevated our sense
of the larger purposes,

00:49:30.446 --> 00:49:34.279
the larger shared value
of what we were doing.

00:49:39.729 --> 00:49:42.562
And so it reinforces the idea that

00:49:43.611 --> 00:49:47.883
there's a privilege to be part
of such a wonderful group.

00:49:47.883 --> 00:49:51.252
Finally, collective ritual
occasions do something else

00:49:51.252 --> 00:49:54.097
that we may normally be less aware of.

00:49:54.097 --> 00:49:56.529
And here I'm gonna talk about a horrible,

00:49:56.529 --> 00:49:59.071
a really horrible, image but I want you

00:49:59.071 --> 00:50:03.387
to think about it and then
generalize it to better things.

00:50:03.387 --> 00:50:06.804
If you think about Jim Jones and his cult

00:50:08.943 --> 00:50:11.443
and the drinking the Kool-Aid,

00:50:12.559 --> 00:50:16.331
that was rehearsed over and over again

00:50:16.331 --> 00:50:19.026
as a test of who was really
committed and who wasn't.

00:50:19.026 --> 00:50:21.620
That is there wasn't
cyanide in the Kool-Aid

00:50:21.620 --> 00:50:25.458
until the last time, but
there was not just a way

00:50:25.458 --> 00:50:29.257
of tricking people into
committing suicide at the end,

00:50:29.257 --> 00:50:32.954
but it was a sign that you were committed.

00:50:32.954 --> 00:50:35.218
Would you stand up with
everyone else and say,

00:50:35.218 --> 00:50:37.577
"Yes, I'll drink the Kool-Aid"?

00:50:37.577 --> 00:50:40.338
And those are ways that
leaders of all sorts,

00:50:40.338 --> 00:50:41.722
and this is particularly true for

00:50:41.722 --> 00:50:45.304
authoritarian societies
and for cults of all sorts,

00:50:45.304 --> 00:50:48.264
they test who's really with them

00:50:48.264 --> 00:50:50.917
through ritual performances.

00:50:50.917 --> 00:50:53.092
So you want to get yourself
killed in North Korea?

00:50:53.092 --> 00:50:54.673
Well actually it's quite easy to do,

00:50:54.673 --> 00:50:57.058
but one of the ways to
do it is not to look

00:50:57.058 --> 00:51:01.227
adequately enthusiastic and
attentive at some public ritual.

00:51:01.227 --> 00:51:06.056
Literally you purge those
who cooperate in the ritual,

00:51:06.056 --> 00:51:10.530
but the ritual allows you to
see who is really with you.

00:51:10.530 --> 00:51:12.491
It's a sort of pre-test of that.

00:51:12.491 --> 00:51:16.186
And so in a much more benign setting,

00:51:16.186 --> 00:51:19.603
we can say that rituals rehearse and test

00:51:20.473 --> 00:51:22.044
the obligations that members

00:51:22.044 --> 00:51:24.612
of community have to one another.

00:51:24.612 --> 00:51:28.081
You may sometimes have
wondered as you shelled out

00:51:28.081 --> 00:51:30.946
money you can't really
afford to attend a wedding

00:51:30.946 --> 00:51:33.708
or a Bat Mitzvah in a distant city

00:51:33.708 --> 00:51:35.851
for relatives you hardly remember

00:51:35.851 --> 00:51:38.010
or with whom you have
very little in common

00:51:38.010 --> 00:51:40.185
when you do see them, why you were going

00:51:40.185 --> 00:51:42.666
to the trouble of doing this?

00:51:42.666 --> 00:51:44.858
But your demonstration
that you are willing

00:51:44.858 --> 00:51:48.859
to put in that effort, spend that money,

00:51:48.859 --> 00:51:52.012
tightens those bonds and makes them real.

00:51:52.012 --> 00:51:54.746
So people often think
that rituals celebrate

00:51:54.746 --> 00:51:58.506
what already exist, but
rituals actually enact

00:51:58.506 --> 00:52:02.273
and bring into being things
that potentially exist.

00:52:02.273 --> 00:52:05.816
I'm thinking for example
of the many weddings

00:52:05.816 --> 00:52:08.633
and Bar and Bat Mitzvahs I've seen

00:52:08.633 --> 00:52:11.853
where a divorced couple has to decide

00:52:11.853 --> 00:52:15.004
how they are going to physically handle

00:52:15.004 --> 00:52:17.043
the complexities of the ritual.

00:52:17.043 --> 00:52:19.139
Well I turned it around
in my head and I think

00:52:19.139 --> 00:52:23.283
that the ritual exists
partly because it is

00:52:23.283 --> 00:52:26.052
the place where people publicly enact

00:52:26.052 --> 00:52:30.128
and therefore reaffirm
their bonds to each other.

00:52:30.128 --> 00:52:34.178
And they don't just reflect the bonds that

00:52:34.178 --> 00:52:38.525
are already there, they
construct new publicly validated

00:52:38.525 --> 00:52:40.402
definitions of those bonds.

00:52:40.402 --> 00:52:43.235
So when I saw the parents,
the divorced parents,

00:52:43.235 --> 00:52:47.535
of one of my nephews
walk together with him,

00:52:47.535 --> 00:52:51.014
stand together with
him at his Bar Mitzvah,

00:52:51.014 --> 00:52:54.826
I knew they were saying,
"We will put you first

00:52:54.826 --> 00:52:58.181
"above our disagreements and
our distaste for each other.

00:52:58.181 --> 00:53:01.263
"And we will be there for
you when you need us."

00:53:01.263 --> 00:53:04.354
I don't even know that they always were,

00:53:04.354 --> 00:53:07.881
but that declaration,
that public declaration,

00:53:07.881 --> 00:53:09.775
shifts the ground.

00:53:09.775 --> 00:53:12.753
It enacts and in a sense the community

00:53:12.753 --> 00:53:16.566
then monitors those public commitments.

00:53:16.566 --> 00:53:18.808
So ritual occasions create the moments

00:53:18.808 --> 00:53:21.414
when people symbolize their loyalties.

00:53:21.414 --> 00:53:23.017
When they think of the Fourth of July

00:53:23.017 --> 00:53:26.262
for patriotic loyalties, but also again

00:53:26.262 --> 00:53:29.504
think of the distant family who show up

00:53:29.504 --> 00:53:32.377
for a cousin's wedding,
or an uncle's funeral.

00:53:32.377 --> 00:53:34.867
And then find that having
reaffirmed their commitment

00:53:34.867 --> 00:53:37.792
in this symbolic way and
this is autobiographical.

00:53:37.792 --> 00:53:39.082
I have done this.

00:53:39.082 --> 00:53:41.693
I both missed a very important funeral

00:53:41.693 --> 00:53:45.336
and it permanently damaged
by relationship to a cousin,

00:53:45.336 --> 00:53:47.692
and I have gone to things that I thought

00:53:47.692 --> 00:53:49.539
I had no real reason to go to,

00:53:49.539 --> 00:53:53.810
and found I was much more
committed to my family afterward.

00:53:53.810 --> 00:53:56.389
So they've now made that commitment real

00:53:56.389 --> 00:53:58.447
in a way it wasn't
before the ritual moment.

00:53:58.447 --> 00:54:00.713
So rituals matter and institutions

00:54:00.713 --> 00:54:02.954
cannot really thrive without them.

00:54:02.954 --> 00:54:06.151
Returning to Lily Tsai's
work on Chinese villages,

00:54:06.151 --> 00:54:08.086
we can see how village temple activity

00:54:08.086 --> 00:54:10.801
strengthen the capacity
of village institutions

00:54:10.801 --> 00:54:12.497
to produce collective goods.

00:54:12.497 --> 00:54:16.131
She writes, "Villagers
have clear obligations

00:54:16.131 --> 00:54:18.021
"to contribute to and participate in

00:54:18.021 --> 00:54:19.776
"village temple activities,

00:54:19.776 --> 00:54:22.116
"because these collective
activities represent

00:54:22.116 --> 00:54:25.506
"group tributes to the
village's guardian deities.

00:54:25.506 --> 00:54:28.030
"Village residents are
expected to make donations

00:54:28.030 --> 00:54:30.086
"to help fund these activities.

00:54:30.086 --> 00:54:32.507
"The names of donors and
the amount they donated

00:54:32.507 --> 00:54:35.236
"are posted publicly on the temple wall.

00:54:35.236 --> 00:54:37.093
"Village temples are an important symbol

00:54:37.093 --> 00:54:38.800
"of the village community.

00:54:38.800 --> 00:54:41.163
"They provide strong
institutions enforcing

00:54:41.163 --> 00:54:43.662
"each member's
responsibility to contribute

00:54:43.662 --> 00:54:46.676
"to the collective good
and numerous opportunities

00:54:46.676 --> 00:54:47.995
"for publicizing whether members

00:54:47.995 --> 00:54:50.450
"have fulfilled their responsibilities."

00:54:50.450 --> 00:54:53.328
Rituals really matter, I'm back to me,

00:54:53.328 --> 00:54:55.501
and without shared rituals
the emotional charge

00:54:55.501 --> 00:54:58.229
they generate and the
concentrated social information

00:54:58.229 --> 00:55:00.046
they convey it is difficult

00:55:00.046 --> 00:55:02.424
to construct binding social ties.

00:55:02.424 --> 00:55:04.862
Enduring social institutions necessarily

00:55:04.862 --> 00:55:07.389
have a symbolic core one that conveys

00:55:07.389 --> 00:55:10.582
membership and meaning, not
just practical interests

00:55:10.582 --> 00:55:12.533
and enforceable obligations.

00:55:12.533 --> 00:55:14.605
Often that symbolic core and the rituals

00:55:14.605 --> 00:55:17.909
that reinforce it work at
an emotional and unconscious

00:55:17.909 --> 00:55:20.375
rather than purely rational level.

00:55:20.375 --> 00:55:22.319
This I think accounts
for some of the emotional

00:55:22.319 --> 00:55:24.569
reactions to the recent election.

00:55:24.569 --> 00:55:26.635
Where love of country has been expressed

00:55:26.635 --> 00:55:29.342
in symbolic rituals, like the arms linked

00:55:29.342 --> 00:55:32.556
around Lake Merritt in Oakland.

00:55:32.556 --> 00:55:35.966
Only because we hold America
and its traditions sacred

00:55:35.966 --> 00:55:39.902
do we feel so violated when
those values are threatened.

00:55:39.902 --> 00:55:43.096
So status and ritual go together
and reinforce each other

00:55:43.096 --> 00:55:45.681
and both reinforce the
ability of institutions

00:55:45.681 --> 00:55:48.786
to call forth commitments
from their members.

00:55:48.786 --> 00:55:52.502
Now I want to return and
this is my last point,

00:55:52.502 --> 00:55:56.232
big point, I have a couple
of other small points,

00:55:56.232 --> 00:55:59.688
to the practical issues
who gains and loses?

00:55:59.688 --> 00:56:02.086
Most of literature on
creating institutions

00:56:02.086 --> 00:56:05.656
really is based on a model
of complex negotiations,

00:56:05.656 --> 00:56:08.401
that is you form
institutions when you realize

00:56:08.401 --> 00:56:10.849
it's in your interests
and you sort of agree

00:56:10.849 --> 00:56:14.049
to bind yourself over to a
set of institutional processes

00:56:14.049 --> 00:56:17.920
and those, and then if you
read Acemoglu and Robinson

00:56:17.920 --> 00:56:20.944
and such literature
they have more an image

00:56:20.944 --> 00:56:23.663
that it's when you're truly threatened

00:56:23.663 --> 00:56:26.838
with losing your control
then you make concessions

00:56:26.838 --> 00:56:28.752
that essentially broaden and deepen

00:56:28.752 --> 00:56:31.025
participation things like that.

00:56:31.025 --> 00:56:34.293
And then why those things
last they're not so clear on.

00:56:34.293 --> 00:56:35.947
But I would say that the models of where

00:56:35.947 --> 00:56:39.705
those institutional commitments
come from are very thin.

00:56:39.705 --> 00:56:42.651
They say a lot of powerful
things about interests

00:56:42.651 --> 00:56:46.403
and very little about the other aspects

00:56:46.403 --> 00:56:48.075
that go along with interests.

00:56:48.075 --> 00:56:50.595
But if we turn to interests for a minute,

00:56:50.595 --> 00:56:54.420
I think it's true that
institutions cannot survive

00:56:54.420 --> 00:56:58.669
if over the long haul
people see that the ideals

00:56:58.669 --> 00:57:01.879
or justifications the institutions embody

00:57:01.879 --> 00:57:03.906
bear no relationship to the ways they

00:57:03.906 --> 00:57:07.739
allocate rewards and
punishments or sanctions.

00:57:08.990 --> 00:57:11.597
Although paradoxically
and here I think we really

00:57:11.597 --> 00:57:13.815
have to take this into account,

00:57:13.815 --> 00:57:17.019
institutions survive
very well and can survive

00:57:17.019 --> 00:57:19.237
over a very long period of time even if

00:57:19.237 --> 00:57:21.239
most people who play by their rules never

00:57:21.239 --> 00:57:24.159
realize the benefits they promise.

00:57:24.159 --> 00:57:27.141
That I think is in fact routine.

00:57:27.141 --> 00:57:29.903
Many, many people try to become academics

00:57:29.903 --> 00:57:31.781
and most will never become the

00:57:31.781 --> 00:57:35.383
fancy professors we're privileged to be.

00:57:35.383 --> 00:57:38.213
Think of the opportunity
the market promises

00:57:38.213 --> 00:57:40.790
for ability and hard
work, in a world in which

00:57:40.790 --> 00:57:44.477
most people will, most not everyone,

00:57:44.477 --> 00:57:47.019
but most people will
get some kind of a job

00:57:47.019 --> 00:57:48.846
and will have some way
of supporting theirself

00:57:48.846 --> 00:57:51.402
but most people will not achieve

00:57:51.402 --> 00:57:54.391
most of the rewards the
system seems to promise.

00:57:54.391 --> 00:57:56.835
People know that the
American Dream probably

00:57:56.835 --> 00:58:00.713
won't work for them, but
they continue to be attached

00:58:00.713 --> 00:58:03.788
to the institutions that
support that fantasy.

00:58:03.788 --> 00:58:07.174
Or the continuing allure of marriage

00:58:07.174 --> 00:58:09.496
even for those who never marry,

00:58:09.496 --> 00:58:11.609
or who are in situations where marriage

00:58:11.609 --> 00:58:14.121
is not a practical possibility,

00:58:14.121 --> 00:58:17.621
even as actual marriages fail many people.

00:58:19.423 --> 00:58:22.016
So institutions do not have to actually

00:58:22.016 --> 00:58:25.239
reward everyone who plays by their rules.

00:58:25.239 --> 00:58:26.544
And I don't think they do,

00:58:26.544 --> 00:58:28.031
I don't think we have evidence that

00:58:28.031 --> 00:58:29.886
that's what makes them work.

00:58:29.886 --> 00:58:33.386
But even though institutions can keep hold

00:58:34.513 --> 00:58:36.974
of imaginations even of many people

00:58:36.974 --> 00:58:39.105
whom they let down in the end,

00:58:39.105 --> 00:58:41.990
that is very different from it becoming

00:58:41.990 --> 00:58:44.701
evident that the very
standards at the core

00:58:44.701 --> 00:58:48.284
of the institution's
narrative do not work.

00:58:49.519 --> 00:58:52.061
That even those who are
successful in the institutions

00:58:52.061 --> 00:58:54.749
own terms aren't rewarded, and here I want

00:58:54.749 --> 00:58:57.970
to briefly mention a great
book, it's an old book,

00:58:57.970 --> 00:59:00.368
by Harrison and Cynthia White,

00:59:00.368 --> 00:59:02.389
on institutional transformation in the

00:59:02.389 --> 00:59:04.515
French painting world and they essentially

00:59:04.515 --> 00:59:08.374
are trying to explain the
rise of the impressionists.

00:59:08.374 --> 00:59:11.784
What they show is that the academic system

00:59:11.784 --> 00:59:14.220
for regulating French painting

00:59:14.220 --> 00:59:16.898
which was a very well-established
institutional system

00:59:16.898 --> 00:59:19.864
with its own educational system and then

00:59:19.864 --> 00:59:22.801
its channels of mobility and so forth,

00:59:22.801 --> 00:59:24.944
depended on the notion that artists

00:59:24.944 --> 00:59:27.420
would achieve rewards and the reward

00:59:27.420 --> 00:59:30.064
was usually patronage
from the French state

00:59:30.064 --> 00:59:32.165
that would then commission
the successful people

00:59:32.165 --> 00:59:34.539
to paint something for a public building,

00:59:34.539 --> 00:59:38.050
or to create a public sculpture,
or something like that.

00:59:38.050 --> 00:59:41.627
Those winners in that
system would be chosen

00:59:41.627 --> 00:59:44.819
in these enormous juried shows,

00:59:44.819 --> 00:59:47.727
and as thousands of provincials started

00:59:47.727 --> 00:59:51.006
to long to become artists and therefore

00:59:51.006 --> 00:59:54.595
flooded into Paris trying to succeed

00:59:54.595 --> 00:59:56.811
spending years creating one painting

00:59:56.811 --> 00:59:59.250
on which their whole fate depended.

00:59:59.250 --> 01:00:01.716
Those thousands and thousands of paintings

01:00:01.716 --> 01:00:03.976
and if you've ever been to the Renwick

01:00:03.976 --> 01:00:06.473
you can kind of imagine
what this was like,

01:00:06.473 --> 01:00:09.056
these very, very tall ceilings,

01:00:11.413 --> 01:00:14.287
very high ceilings, and walls covered

01:00:14.287 --> 01:00:16.598
with thousands of paintings.

01:00:16.598 --> 01:00:20.508
Then you had these juries,
let's imagine six or seven men

01:00:20.508 --> 01:00:23.041
in some kind of black
robes wandering around

01:00:23.041 --> 01:00:26.483
they couldn't even see the paintings.

01:00:26.483 --> 01:00:28.944
They couldn't even see them.

01:00:28.944 --> 01:00:31.506
There could be no pretense
that they were choosing

01:00:31.506 --> 01:00:34.600
the best, that they truly were judging

01:00:34.600 --> 01:00:38.704
which artist deserved
these enormous rewards.

01:00:38.704 --> 01:00:40.920
So it wasn't just that
the number of rewards

01:00:40.920 --> 01:00:44.039
was far too small for
the number of aspirants,

01:00:44.039 --> 01:00:47.962
it was that the pretense
that the rewards made sense

01:00:47.962 --> 01:00:50.929
in terms of the
institution's own narrative

01:00:50.929 --> 01:00:52.236
couldn't be maintained.

01:00:52.236 --> 01:00:54.459
And then I don't know how true this is

01:00:54.459 --> 01:00:56.863
but the Whites paint this picture where

01:00:56.863 --> 01:00:59.410
a new institutional
system grows up outside

01:00:59.410 --> 01:01:00.711
the old order they call it the

01:01:00.711 --> 01:01:03.022
dealer or critic system and that's the one

01:01:03.022 --> 01:01:06.830
out of which the support
for the impressionists

01:01:06.830 --> 01:01:10.278
emerges but also a new narrative which is

01:01:10.278 --> 01:01:12.820
the starving artist in the garret who is

01:01:12.820 --> 01:01:16.499
discovered by the early purchasers who see

01:01:16.499 --> 01:01:19.845
the genius and the artist starves and dies

01:01:19.845 --> 01:01:24.012
but those who supported his
or her work are vindicated.

01:01:25.435 --> 01:01:29.418
Okay, so it may seem
surprising that narratives,

01:01:29.418 --> 01:01:32.630
stories linking more meanings to outcomes,

01:01:32.630 --> 01:01:34.116
could be essential to the

01:01:34.116 --> 01:01:36.733
patterned realities we call institutions,

01:01:36.733 --> 01:01:39.607
but I think they are incredibly important.

01:01:39.607 --> 01:01:42.405
When we try to export
participatory decision making

01:01:42.405 --> 01:01:45.749
institutions to Africa,
or we aspire to create

01:01:45.749 --> 01:01:49.110
new global institutions to
regulate carbon emissions,

01:01:49.110 --> 01:01:52.924
or to prevent war, or to rescue refugees,

01:01:52.924 --> 01:01:54.862
we may not think that we are constructing

01:01:54.862 --> 01:01:57.005
a persuasive narrative.

01:01:57.005 --> 01:02:00.412
A narrative for example
about how empowered women

01:02:00.412 --> 01:02:04.893
will be able to prevent
themselves from acquiring HIV.

01:02:04.893 --> 01:02:09.549
But that is precisely what
drives policy formation.

01:02:09.549 --> 01:02:12.132
Policy comes when the narrative

01:02:13.101 --> 01:02:17.814
is moving and persuasive
and seems to makes sense.

01:02:17.814 --> 01:02:21.838
So narratives are really
central to creating institutions

01:02:21.838 --> 01:02:24.509
even as we try to envision
rules that will guide

01:02:24.509 --> 01:02:26.767
expectations over the long run and somehow

01:02:26.767 --> 01:02:29.517
we home acquire enduring authority

01:02:29.517 --> 01:02:32.334
to regulate or constrain action.

01:02:32.334 --> 01:02:35.536
Indeed I think good research suggests

01:02:35.536 --> 01:02:39.143
that creating new
institutions usually means

01:02:39.143 --> 01:02:43.060
in fact not creating
institutions from scratch.

01:02:44.348 --> 01:02:49.004
It usually means adapting
pieces of already existing

01:02:49.004 --> 01:02:51.618
institutions and I think narratives play

01:02:51.618 --> 01:02:53.900
a critical role in this process.

01:02:53.900 --> 01:02:56.795
I think that's why in the
Cornell and Kalt findings

01:02:56.795 --> 01:02:59.291
it matters what Native American groups

01:02:59.291 --> 01:03:02.826
governance structures
were a long time ago,

01:03:02.826 --> 01:03:04.498
even when there isn't continuity

01:03:04.498 --> 01:03:07.532
in the actual concrete institution.

01:03:07.532 --> 01:03:10.127
And I want to use just
a couple of last pieces

01:03:10.127 --> 01:03:13.906
of research to suggest
that this might be true

01:03:13.906 --> 01:03:15.861
without having done research that can show

01:03:15.861 --> 01:03:17.720
that it actually is true.

01:03:17.720 --> 01:03:20.739
And one is a book on Africa
by an anthropologist,

01:03:20.739 --> 01:03:24.390
Sandra Barnes, the book is
called Patrons and Power.

01:03:24.390 --> 01:03:26.561
It's a wonderful study of what happened

01:03:26.561 --> 01:03:28.978
in a suburb of Lagos, Nigeria

01:03:30.437 --> 01:03:33.243
when enormous numbers of people, millions,

01:03:33.243 --> 01:03:36.859
had moved into an unincorporated
area outside Lagos.

01:03:36.859 --> 01:03:39.000
So they had no political representation

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.583
and no way to get services like

01:03:42.560 --> 01:03:45.070
running water, and
sanitation, and so forth.

01:03:45.070 --> 01:03:46.208
What did they do?

01:03:46.208 --> 01:03:49.018
And these were groups from
multiple different ethnic groups.

01:03:49.018 --> 01:03:50.681
They weren't even all Yoruba,

01:03:50.681 --> 01:03:53.817
let alone from the same Yoruba tribe.

01:03:53.817 --> 01:03:55.484
They created chiefs.

01:03:57.184 --> 01:03:59.307
They invented chieftaincies.

01:03:59.307 --> 01:04:01.353
And then people who wanted to be chiefs,

01:04:01.353 --> 01:04:04.186
invented genealogies that legitimated

01:04:04.186 --> 01:04:06.769
their chieftaincy claims and so

01:04:08.320 --> 01:04:09.721
what's fascinating is these weren't

01:04:09.721 --> 01:04:12.721
actual chiefs who set up shop there.

01:04:13.621 --> 01:04:17.353
This was a collective attempt to create

01:04:17.353 --> 01:04:19.472
legitimate forms of political authority,

01:04:19.472 --> 01:04:23.982
and political access by
taking the familiar narrative

01:04:23.982 --> 01:04:26.549
that everyone could recognize about

01:04:26.549 --> 01:04:29.484
how you form yourself as a collectivity

01:04:29.484 --> 01:04:34.015
and what it means to be
represented politically

01:04:34.015 --> 01:04:37.729
and then inventing brand new chieftaincies

01:04:37.729 --> 01:04:39.771
which in fact got them represent,

01:04:39.771 --> 01:04:42.979
I mean that was then those
people had a lot of influence.

01:04:42.979 --> 01:04:44.571
They could go to politicians.

01:04:44.571 --> 01:04:46.195
There's a very similar story from

01:04:46.195 --> 01:04:48.981
a totally different historical era

01:04:48.981 --> 01:04:50.794
which is from a book that's much

01:04:50.794 --> 01:04:52.442
too complicated to summarize,

01:04:52.442 --> 01:04:55.692
but Rick Biernacki's book
the Fabrication of Labor.

01:04:55.692 --> 01:04:59.355
And Biernacki argues that if
you try to look at how labor,

01:04:59.355 --> 01:05:02.845
that is the relationship between
factory owners and workers,

01:05:02.845 --> 01:05:07.331
got constituted differently
in Britain and Germany

01:05:07.331 --> 01:05:09.786
what you need to see is what the earlier

01:05:09.786 --> 01:05:13.953
institutions were that they
adapted at great remove

01:05:15.465 --> 01:05:18.529
in order to imagine what the factory was

01:05:18.529 --> 01:05:19.649
and what labor was.

01:05:19.649 --> 01:05:22.675
And Biernacki says that
they were essentially

01:05:22.675 --> 01:05:25.432
in Germany where they did not already have

01:05:25.432 --> 01:05:28.530
a market in labor and in commodities

01:05:28.530 --> 01:05:30.506
at the time of industrialization,

01:05:30.506 --> 01:05:32.454
they adapted the futile form

01:05:32.454 --> 01:05:34.201
these would have been the Junkers

01:05:34.201 --> 01:05:38.737
who could get corvee
labor from their peasants.

01:05:38.737 --> 01:05:41.074
That's one day a month
you have to come and build

01:05:41.074 --> 01:05:45.128
the stone wall around my
land or something like that.

01:05:45.128 --> 01:05:47.883
And they saw when they paid for labor,

01:05:47.883 --> 01:05:49.790
they thought of it in that way

01:05:49.790 --> 01:05:52.895
they were buying the time of the laborer

01:05:52.895 --> 01:05:54.723
with a wad of money.

01:05:54.723 --> 01:05:56.901
When the British constructed factories

01:05:56.901 --> 01:05:59.255
they already had a market
in labor and commodities

01:05:59.255 --> 01:06:00.480
so what they thought they were doing

01:06:00.480 --> 01:06:03.751
is something like the putting-out system

01:06:03.751 --> 01:06:05.190
brought within four walls.

01:06:05.190 --> 01:06:08.511
They were buying the piece of cloth

01:06:08.511 --> 01:06:10.009
and paying for it in terms of

01:06:10.009 --> 01:06:11.993
how high quality the cloth was,

01:06:11.993 --> 01:06:15.076
how many threads per inch there were,

01:06:16.121 --> 01:06:19.288
and Germans and British factory owners

01:06:20.754 --> 01:06:23.783
continued to use radically
different systems

01:06:23.783 --> 01:06:26.858
for understanding how
they paid their workers.

01:06:26.858 --> 01:06:30.686
Based on the institutional
models, the imaginaries,

01:06:30.686 --> 01:06:34.064
they were drawing on in these
two very different contexts.

01:06:34.064 --> 01:06:37.897
So, now I conclude and
my conclusion is really

01:06:39.747 --> 01:06:41.599
that the question of how you create

01:06:41.599 --> 01:06:44.546
good institutions is so critical

01:06:44.546 --> 01:06:47.948
that we really need
serious research on this

01:06:47.948 --> 01:06:49.610
so that the next time
we have to think about

01:06:49.610 --> 01:06:51.909
such problems we don't find that our

01:06:51.909 --> 01:06:54.991
theoretical and research cupboard is bare.

01:06:54.991 --> 01:06:58.248
That is the a-number-one,
this is not a problem

01:06:58.248 --> 01:06:59.688
I'm gonna solve, this is a problem

01:06:59.688 --> 01:07:02.367
I think is urgently important.

01:07:02.367 --> 01:07:05.472
But I have a couple of
final morals of the story.

01:07:05.472 --> 01:07:07.171
The first is don't flee

01:07:07.171 --> 01:07:11.201
from effective institutions, seek them.

01:07:11.201 --> 01:07:15.097
Don't let yourself be, I
don't know what word to use,

01:07:15.097 --> 01:07:18.441
diluted, overwhelmed, sucked in,

01:07:18.441 --> 01:07:21.790
by the American romance in which

01:07:21.790 --> 01:07:24.310
this is very American
if we can only throw off

01:07:24.310 --> 01:07:27.630
institutions and just
be free to be ourselves.

01:07:27.630 --> 01:07:29.609
The day after the
election I was talking to,

01:07:29.609 --> 01:07:31.310
I bought shoes believe it or not.

01:07:31.310 --> 01:07:33.210
I mean I was so crazed, but anyway,

01:07:33.210 --> 01:07:34.232
I was talking to this young woman

01:07:34.232 --> 01:07:36.732
from Zappos and she said that,

01:07:37.721 --> 01:07:39.240
oh she was very chatty.

01:07:39.240 --> 01:07:41.281
She said, oh yes, I
live in Nevada and this

01:07:41.281 --> 01:07:44.144
you know terrible outcome
election blah, blah, blah.

01:07:44.144 --> 01:07:47.076
And then she said, I didn't vote,

01:07:47.076 --> 01:07:51.077
in Nevada you can vote none
of the above, she said.

01:07:51.077 --> 01:07:52.459
And that's how I voted because I wanted

01:07:52.459 --> 01:07:54.792
to be true to my conscience.

01:07:56.035 --> 01:07:59.202
I, well yeah, I'll leave that hanging.

01:08:00.839 --> 01:08:04.597
And I also want to say
that one more thing,

01:08:04.597 --> 01:08:07.680
which is loss of an institutional legacy

01:08:07.680 --> 01:08:09.956
also constricts our imagination about

01:08:09.956 --> 01:08:13.085
what politics and social
life are or could be.

01:08:13.085 --> 01:08:16.138
That is it's not only that
we base our institutions

01:08:16.138 --> 01:08:19.055
on narratives that seem persuasive,

01:08:19.952 --> 01:08:22.227
but that the narratives we constitute

01:08:22.227 --> 01:08:24.885
about who we are and about our own lives

01:08:24.885 --> 01:08:28.135
in turn depend on institutional models.

01:08:29.046 --> 01:08:32.403
So just as institutional
capacities often come

01:08:32.403 --> 01:08:35.480
from resuscitating older
institutional models

01:08:35.480 --> 01:08:38.813
to serve in new ways, as we saw with the

01:08:40.459 --> 01:08:44.626
suburb of Lagos or the
workers and bosses in Germany.

01:08:46.146 --> 01:08:48.874
The loss of institutions
threatens to leave us

01:08:48.874 --> 01:08:52.075
with the understanding that
only market institutions

01:08:52.075 --> 01:08:56.242
money, raw coercive power,
and market forces are real.

01:08:59.056 --> 01:09:02.056
(audience applauds)

01:09:03.769 --> 01:09:07.593
- [Woman] I have two
issues slash questions

01:09:07.593 --> 01:09:11.343
I'd like to raise, one
is coming back to your

01:09:12.690 --> 01:09:16.759
definition of good and good institutions,

01:09:16.759 --> 01:09:20.926
and good I mean we may know
what is good versus evil,

01:09:23.406 --> 01:09:26.323
but good can have many definitions.

01:09:27.158 --> 01:09:31.075
And an example is, one
example is the election.

01:09:32.695 --> 01:09:36.577
And there are you talked
about people gathering

01:09:36.577 --> 01:09:40.353
around Lake Merritt, well there are people

01:09:40.353 --> 01:09:44.020
you know this was a
very tiny, tiny majority

01:09:45.983 --> 01:09:49.102
not the popular vote but the

01:09:49.102 --> 01:09:51.769
electoral college vote was tiny.

01:09:53.258 --> 01:09:58.128
And there are people who
felt that voting for Trump

01:09:58.128 --> 01:10:02.045
was good and that that
government will be good.

01:10:03.707 --> 01:10:07.190
So I think we need to recognize good.

01:10:07.190 --> 01:10:09.807
I was watching television the other night

01:10:09.807 --> 01:10:13.974
and a potential secretary of
I guess the interior said,

01:10:16.782 --> 01:10:19.990
climate change, saying that climate change

01:10:19.990 --> 01:10:22.157
is caused by man is silly.

01:10:23.960 --> 01:10:28.127
We don't agree, I assume
nobody in this room agrees, but

01:10:30.435 --> 01:10:34.185
that is one definition
of a good institution.

01:10:35.485 --> 01:10:40.054
So I think we need to, I
mean, that is one person

01:10:40.054 --> 01:10:43.362
perhaps a group's definition of good.

01:10:43.362 --> 01:10:46.029
So good institutions can differ.

01:10:47.374 --> 01:10:51.374
May other question comment
is a lot of your work

01:10:52.819 --> 01:10:56.152
has been about NGOs and criticizing NGOs

01:10:58.804 --> 01:11:01.071
and you didn't mention that here but

01:11:01.071 --> 01:11:03.709
NGOs, there are lots of NGOs,

01:11:03.709 --> 01:11:06.709
but that is an institution that, and

01:11:10.255 --> 01:11:12.554
I don't know do you want to
say something about NGOs?

01:11:12.554 --> 01:11:14.346
(Ann laughs)

01:11:14.346 --> 01:11:16.855
- Yeah let me try to address
this thing about good.

01:11:16.855 --> 01:11:21.168
So I was, one reason I
define good institutions

01:11:21.168 --> 01:11:24.541
really by the set of outcomes which is

01:11:24.541 --> 01:11:27.084
that they produce I don't
know what you'd call

01:11:27.084 --> 01:11:30.224
but let's call them public
goods in the economist sense,

01:11:30.224 --> 01:11:32.715
rather than all the other
things I might think

01:11:32.715 --> 01:11:35.187
make institutions good
like being inclusive,

01:11:35.187 --> 01:11:37.863
and democratic, and participatory,

01:11:37.863 --> 01:11:40.113
or being just by my lights,

01:11:43.268 --> 01:11:46.356
or being representing my ethnic group,

01:11:46.356 --> 01:11:50.681
or representing God's
will or this and that.

01:11:50.681 --> 01:11:52.368
I mean I agree with you that when it comes

01:11:52.368 --> 01:11:55.366
to people's moral
understandings of what's good,

01:11:55.366 --> 01:11:57.640
I don't think actually we face chaos.

01:11:57.640 --> 01:11:59.205
It might feel like it I actually

01:11:59.205 --> 01:12:02.394
don't think that's
true, but it's true that

01:12:02.394 --> 01:12:06.998
people can have profoundly
different starting points

01:12:06.998 --> 01:12:11.155
for thinking about such
issues and they can end up,

01:12:11.155 --> 01:12:13.535
I think looking at (mumbles) here

01:12:13.535 --> 01:12:15.937
but they can end up so profoundly divided

01:12:15.937 --> 01:12:19.705
in certain ways that the whole
set of premises they have

01:12:19.705 --> 01:12:22.418
about what their common life should be

01:12:22.418 --> 01:12:25.523
really create divisions they can't bridge.

01:12:25.523 --> 01:12:29.417
So I'm not saying that
there's only one definition

01:12:29.417 --> 01:12:31.577
of the good and that I
have it or something,

01:12:31.577 --> 01:12:34.887
I really was trying to use
a very sort of concrete

01:12:34.887 --> 01:12:39.426
and pragmatic definition
of good institutions,

01:12:39.426 --> 01:12:41.834
not as the ones that we
would necessarily find

01:12:41.834 --> 01:12:44.084
morally the most appealing,

01:12:45.121 --> 01:12:47.280
but the ones that are
able to accomplish certain

01:12:47.280 --> 01:12:51.402
kinds of things in their
particular historical context.

01:12:51.402 --> 01:12:53.060
And I think they often don't look like

01:12:53.060 --> 01:12:55.965
the kind of institutions
I mean you would not like

01:12:55.965 --> 01:12:59.703
living in a chieftaincy I
can absolutely guarantee it.

01:12:59.703 --> 01:13:02.116
You would hate it, no you would hate it.

01:13:02.116 --> 01:13:05.944
And many, many people go
to Africa, for example,

01:13:05.944 --> 01:13:08.742
and just see these
things as totally corrupt

01:13:08.742 --> 01:13:10.633
which to some degree they are,

01:13:10.633 --> 01:13:13.640
that is you give a gift to the chief

01:13:13.640 --> 01:13:16.120
and if some goodies come into the village

01:13:16.120 --> 01:13:20.155
the chief will certainly
take, skim a share.

01:13:20.155 --> 01:13:22.157
But not nearly the share that the

01:13:22.157 --> 01:13:25.534
government officials will skim (laughs).

01:13:25.534 --> 01:13:27.440
And there are reasons for that, so.

01:13:27.440 --> 01:13:28.392
- [Man] Hi my name's Ethan.

01:13:28.392 --> 01:13:31.567
I'm a sociologist at UC Davis.

01:13:31.567 --> 01:13:35.417
You mentioned this piece about status,

01:13:35.417 --> 01:13:38.888
hierarchies and rituals
and gave some examples

01:13:38.888 --> 01:13:41.691
and I'm trying to struggle with this

01:13:41.691 --> 01:13:44.250
how we've divided ourselves and like

01:13:44.250 --> 01:13:46.810
the identity politics that seem to be

01:13:46.810 --> 01:13:49.067
really driving a lot of things, and so.

01:13:49.067 --> 01:13:52.386
But the examples you gave
of where hierarchies work,

01:13:52.386 --> 01:13:56.015
or where status works, rituals
work, seemed very small.

01:13:56.015 --> 01:13:57.823
And so I'm asking you if you've thought

01:13:57.823 --> 01:13:59.963
have we just outgrown
our capacity to reach

01:13:59.963 --> 01:14:03.860
across demographics to
share in that type of work?

01:14:03.860 --> 01:14:06.953
And that that's a place for change?

01:14:06.953 --> 01:14:10.218
Or is it that we are dividing ourselves

01:14:10.218 --> 01:14:14.468
into smaller identities
that is problematic?

01:14:14.468 --> 01:14:16.295
- Yeah, I was going to say oh shoot

01:14:16.295 --> 01:14:18.450
that's a really good point and I hoped

01:14:18.450 --> 01:14:20.668
wouldn't be too obvious.

01:14:20.668 --> 01:14:22.839
No, I think you're right that the image

01:14:22.839 --> 01:14:25.922
of ritual that I find very persuasive

01:14:26.861 --> 01:14:28.319
is the kind of thing that happens

01:14:28.319 --> 01:14:30.969
in face-to-face situations or at least

01:14:30.969 --> 01:14:33.969
in televisable moments of situations

01:14:34.832 --> 01:14:38.100
and that it's a little hard to figure out

01:14:38.100 --> 01:14:40.591
exactly how that applies to whole,

01:14:40.591 --> 01:14:42.546
very large, collectivities.

01:14:42.546 --> 01:14:44.490
But I think you're still
pointing to something

01:14:44.490 --> 01:14:48.358
which is that, that if
what our current politics

01:14:48.358 --> 01:14:50.587
and the desire for let's call it

01:14:50.587 --> 01:14:54.607
let's use the Charles Taylor
or whatever term recognition.

01:14:54.607 --> 01:14:57.790
So enormous numbers of groups
with different identities

01:14:57.790 --> 01:14:59.602
and different needs and it's not just

01:14:59.602 --> 01:15:01.632
racial and ethnic identity politics

01:15:01.632 --> 01:15:04.269
or sexual community identity politics.

01:15:04.269 --> 01:15:08.221
Really it's part of, or religious
group identity politics,

01:15:08.221 --> 01:15:12.702
it's part of I think the
whole way we've learned

01:15:12.702 --> 01:15:15.006
to speak about collective life

01:15:15.006 --> 01:15:18.205
is to make sure everyone feels recognized.

01:15:18.205 --> 01:15:21.274
And then the question is does that allow

01:15:21.274 --> 01:15:22.941
room for there to be

01:15:24.616 --> 01:15:27.616
a recognition of some kind of elite,

01:15:28.659 --> 01:15:32.072
and here I'll just use the
brutal term elite status,

01:15:32.072 --> 01:15:34.509
that everyone would be willing to defer to

01:15:34.509 --> 01:15:36.681
because we see those people?

01:15:36.681 --> 01:15:39.008
And I'm really not thinking of me.

01:15:39.008 --> 01:15:42.881
But I'm thinking of people like people who

01:15:42.881 --> 01:15:46.729
would serve on some
governmental commission

01:15:46.729 --> 01:15:49.829
to try to deal with the crisis facing us

01:15:49.829 --> 01:15:52.128
if money for Medicare runs out.

01:15:52.128 --> 01:15:55.349
Or people who would be seen
as potential neutral arbiters

01:15:55.349 --> 01:15:58.732
and I think if our theory
is that everyone has

01:15:58.732 --> 01:16:02.243
his or her own reality,
that your reality is shaped

01:16:02.243 --> 01:16:04.826
by your social position so that

01:16:05.817 --> 01:16:08.640
standpoint theory is our only theory,

01:16:08.640 --> 01:16:10.730
I think we're really in bad shape.

01:16:10.730 --> 01:16:13.574
I think those are not good bases on which

01:16:13.574 --> 01:16:15.384
to build collective institutional life.

01:16:15.384 --> 01:16:18.753
So in a way I agree with
you but I think that

01:16:18.753 --> 01:16:20.111
if you really want to think about

01:16:20.111 --> 01:16:24.226
how to rebuild institutions
confronting the fact

01:16:24.226 --> 01:16:27.208
that and even coming out of this election

01:16:27.208 --> 01:16:29.863
everyone is gonna conclude
that the problem is

01:16:29.863 --> 01:16:31.767
that the elites are too elitist.

01:16:31.767 --> 01:16:35.047
Well my problem is the
elites aren't elite enough.

01:16:35.047 --> 01:16:37.038
What's the matter with them?

01:16:37.038 --> 01:16:40.585
You know, enriching yourself privately

01:16:40.585 --> 01:16:43.502
is totally incompatible with really

01:16:44.363 --> 01:16:45.773
being a member of the elite.

01:16:45.773 --> 01:16:48.390
If you want to claim
national leadership status

01:16:48.390 --> 01:16:50.546
you have to be in some ways heroic,

01:16:50.546 --> 01:16:51.852
and maybe this gets a little to

01:16:51.852 --> 01:16:53.507
Joanna's question about the NGOs.

01:16:53.507 --> 01:16:57.090
I think one of the
reasons that people have

01:16:58.923 --> 01:17:01.953
run headlong in, sometimes
in not very fruitful

01:17:01.953 --> 01:17:06.120
direction is because they're
looking for some kind of

01:17:06.968 --> 01:17:10.218
heroic self-abnegation, self-sacrifice,

01:17:11.327 --> 01:17:15.588
so we're much more
willing to believe that,

01:17:15.588 --> 01:17:17.533
now his name is gonna go
completely out of my head,

01:17:17.533 --> 01:17:20.116
but the partners in health guy.

01:17:21.110 --> 01:17:21.943
- [Man] Farmer.

01:17:21.943 --> 01:17:24.179
- Yes, thank you, James Farmer.

01:17:24.179 --> 01:17:25.012
- [Audience Members] Paul.

01:17:25.012 --> 01:17:26.735
- Paul, Paul Farmer, sorry.

01:17:26.735 --> 01:17:28.860
James Farmer is someone
else important, but not,

01:17:28.860 --> 01:17:32.175
yeah Paul Farmer has a kind of heroism

01:17:32.175 --> 01:17:34.102
I kind of genuine elite status.

01:17:34.102 --> 01:17:36.813
A kind of genuine willingness to sacrifice

01:17:36.813 --> 01:17:39.550
for the public good that allows sort of

01:17:39.550 --> 01:17:42.194
the collective imagination to focus on him

01:17:42.194 --> 01:17:43.773
and the vision he's offering.

01:17:43.773 --> 01:17:47.744
And I think we don't know
how to construct that again.

01:17:47.744 --> 01:17:50.390
I mean it's even if you
think about Skopcol's book,

01:17:50.390 --> 01:17:52.806
Protecting Soldiers and Mothers,

01:17:52.806 --> 01:17:55.679
one of the reasons women
during the Progressive Era

01:17:55.679 --> 01:17:59.666
were able to be so influential
in American politics

01:17:59.666 --> 01:18:02.445
is because Americans
don't like politicians

01:18:02.445 --> 01:18:06.099
they think they're corrupt
and self-interested,

01:18:06.099 --> 01:18:08.250
and women were seen as above politics

01:18:08.250 --> 01:18:10.149
because they didn't have the vote.

01:18:10.149 --> 01:18:12.299
Because what they did
was seen as really being

01:18:12.299 --> 01:18:15.776
for the public good so they could mobilize

01:18:15.776 --> 01:18:18.504
some kind of prestigious
commissions and things,

01:18:18.504 --> 01:18:20.373
that's exactly what they did do.

01:18:20.373 --> 01:18:22.736
You know to study the
problem of tainted milk,

01:18:22.736 --> 01:18:24.420
or the problem of infants dying,

01:18:24.420 --> 01:18:26.934
or the problem of rat feces in the meat,

01:18:26.934 --> 01:18:30.788
or whatever it was, and try to get reform.

01:18:30.788 --> 01:18:33.817
So I think realizing that we've gotten

01:18:33.817 --> 01:18:37.649
so good at being suspicious of elites,

01:18:37.649 --> 01:18:39.385
that I think it's actually undermined

01:18:39.385 --> 01:18:43.552
our ability to think about
what we need going forward, so.

01:18:45.412 --> 01:18:46.245
Yes.

01:18:48.044 --> 01:18:49.959
- [Woman] Thank you I'm a little thrown

01:18:49.959 --> 01:18:52.241
by the great questions ahead of me.

01:18:52.241 --> 01:18:55.241
You said something that I understood

01:18:56.755 --> 01:18:59.588
to be seek effective institutions.

01:19:02.661 --> 01:19:04.466
Can you say a little more about that?

01:19:04.466 --> 01:19:07.778
- Well I think partly that was the whole

01:19:07.778 --> 01:19:09.411
talk was meant to be about that.

01:19:09.411 --> 01:19:12.797
But just I guess I have this fear

01:19:12.797 --> 01:19:17.619
that people are going to
turn away from government.

01:19:17.619 --> 01:19:20.702
Going to say, "Oh I hate bureaucracy.

01:19:20.702 --> 01:19:23.146
"I hate the administration."

01:19:23.146 --> 01:19:25.266
For instance if you're a member of the

01:19:25.266 --> 01:19:27.176
university community, which I can't help

01:19:27.176 --> 01:19:29.443
but think about because it's the community

01:19:29.443 --> 01:19:31.976
I'm most attached to and really there's

01:19:31.976 --> 01:19:35.076
a kind of let's get
rid of this chancellor.

01:19:35.076 --> 01:19:36.220
And then, oh we don't like him either,

01:19:36.220 --> 01:19:37.395
let's get rid of the next one,

01:19:37.395 --> 01:19:40.526
then oh let's get, oh it
may be that some of them

01:19:40.526 --> 01:19:42.669
have been much better than others.

01:19:42.669 --> 01:19:46.002
But the idea that sort of slash and burn

01:19:47.104 --> 01:19:49.641
is really the way to go in terms of

01:19:49.641 --> 01:19:52.839
our institutional life, I
just don't think it's true.

01:19:52.839 --> 01:19:56.839
And so I'm not justifying any particular

01:19:56.839 --> 01:19:59.390
person who was either
incompetent, or self-dealing,

01:19:59.390 --> 01:20:02.191
or corrupt, or didn't tell the truth.

01:20:02.191 --> 01:20:05.608
But I think the level of sort of savagery

01:20:06.870 --> 01:20:09.720
that we think is now appropriate

01:20:09.720 --> 01:20:11.694
toward anyone who attempts to take

01:20:11.694 --> 01:20:15.209
a position of leadership
if that's our style

01:20:15.209 --> 01:20:18.265
then don't we really expect
leaders to be demagogues

01:20:18.265 --> 01:20:20.310
who can just ride rough shot over that,

01:20:20.310 --> 01:20:23.297
because any reasonable person

01:20:23.297 --> 01:20:26.547
how could he or she stand up to it, so?

01:20:27.692 --> 01:20:31.588
That's my, that's where I was coming from.

01:20:31.588 --> 01:20:34.155
- [Woman] Thank you that
clarifies, thank you.

01:20:34.155 --> 01:20:35.403
- [Woman] Talk about
what the difference is

01:20:35.403 --> 01:20:37.899
between your idea of endowment

01:20:37.899 --> 01:20:40.418
and the idea of legitimacy that is used

01:20:40.418 --> 01:20:43.466
to evaluate the extent to which people

01:20:43.466 --> 01:20:45.844
respond to the purposes
that you talked about

01:20:45.844 --> 01:20:48.212
and the principles that are embedded

01:20:48.212 --> 01:20:50.850
in the purposes of the
different institutions.

01:20:50.850 --> 01:20:53.514
It seems to me that's
what legitimacy is about

01:20:53.514 --> 01:20:57.409
is an evaluation that's
continual and perpetual

01:20:57.409 --> 01:20:58.583
that people are constantly doing about

01:20:58.583 --> 01:21:01.993
every institution that
affects their lives.

01:21:01.993 --> 01:21:03.864
And that it's a lot different than just

01:21:03.864 --> 01:21:06.031
an endowment of something.

01:21:07.932 --> 01:21:11.349
- Well, okay so for me the word endowment

01:21:12.749 --> 01:21:15.666
is meant to connote I guess all the

01:21:20.978 --> 01:21:24.170
long legacy of other people's efforts

01:21:24.170 --> 01:21:26.818
that have built something
up to be what it is.

01:21:26.818 --> 01:21:30.555
And actually again I'll
refer to the university here

01:21:30.555 --> 01:21:33.946
where it's incredible
privilege to be here.

01:21:33.946 --> 01:21:35.572
The University of California Berkeley

01:21:35.572 --> 01:21:37.447
is certainly the greatest
public university

01:21:37.447 --> 01:21:38.619
in the world and maybe the greatest

01:21:38.619 --> 01:21:41.202
single university in the world.

01:21:42.126 --> 01:21:44.947
It's not because of anything I did.

01:21:44.947 --> 01:21:48.604
It's because of
generations and generations

01:21:48.604 --> 01:21:51.344
of people, taxpayers who
put their tax dollars

01:21:51.344 --> 01:21:54.217
into the institutions,
administrators who built it,

01:21:54.217 --> 01:21:57.729
indeed the endowment of the
corpus of scholarly work

01:21:57.729 --> 01:22:00.481
that comes from generations
and generations before us

01:22:00.481 --> 01:22:02.640
and you know this very well.

01:22:02.640 --> 01:22:06.484
And so I have a feeling
that that endowment

01:22:06.484 --> 01:22:09.415
gets built up over time,
sometimes it also involves

01:22:09.415 --> 01:22:11.474
an endowment of money and you're right

01:22:11.474 --> 01:22:15.650
it involves an endowment of
purposes that's for sure.

01:22:15.650 --> 01:22:18.150
And I don't want to fight you,

01:22:19.946 --> 01:22:22.755
especially you to the death about

01:22:22.755 --> 01:22:25.408
rejecting the concept of legitimacy.

01:22:25.408 --> 01:22:28.915
But there my sense is, wow we would could

01:22:28.915 --> 01:22:32.798
dissipate this thing pretty
quickly, for example,

01:22:32.798 --> 01:22:36.671
if just let me do a really
worst case scenario.

01:22:36.671 --> 01:22:38.104
Berkeley desperately needs money.

01:22:38.104 --> 01:22:39.533
It decides a Berkeley degree

01:22:39.533 --> 01:22:42.006
because of the brand
is really worth a lot,

01:22:42.006 --> 01:22:44.497
and so it will just sell them.

01:22:44.497 --> 01:22:46.783
Something very similar by the way happened

01:22:46.783 --> 01:22:48.712
before the French Revolution
when the French state

01:22:48.712 --> 01:22:51.926
was desperate to raise
money and it sold offices.

01:22:51.926 --> 01:22:54.254
And actually the English Crown did it

01:22:54.254 --> 01:22:55.596
before the English Revolution also.

01:22:55.596 --> 01:22:57.669
They sold baronets.

01:22:57.669 --> 01:23:00.908
You know it's not impossible
if you're desperate enough

01:23:00.908 --> 01:23:03.287
and you just would sell
degrees or sell them

01:23:03.287 --> 01:23:06.787
for some minimal amount of symbolic effort

01:23:08.031 --> 01:23:10.339
knowing full well they didn't
really represent anything

01:23:10.339 --> 01:23:13.375
and then you would
spend up that endowment,

01:23:13.375 --> 01:23:15.981
you would deplete it almost overnight.

01:23:15.981 --> 01:23:20.122
So that's the sense in
which I think of endowment

01:23:20.122 --> 01:23:24.289
as that sort of accumulated set
of commitments and resources

01:23:27.453 --> 01:23:30.453
and so I guess that's how I mean it.

01:23:31.369 --> 01:23:33.120
Now, I agree with you.

01:23:33.120 --> 01:23:34.915
The reason I don't like
the term legitimacy

01:23:34.915 --> 01:23:37.555
or at least it's the fallback when people

01:23:37.555 --> 01:23:41.432
try to explain why culture
matters for institutions.

01:23:41.432 --> 01:23:44.613
The thing they grab first
is the word legitimacy

01:23:44.613 --> 01:23:47.401
and they tend to mean by it,

01:23:47.401 --> 01:23:51.598
a belief that the
institution is right or good

01:23:51.598 --> 01:23:53.543
or the way to do things
and there certainly is

01:23:53.543 --> 01:23:55.244
that's gonna make a difference.

01:23:55.244 --> 01:23:58.226
For example, if at some
point the Supreme Court

01:23:58.226 --> 01:24:01.653
tells Donald Trump that
he has to do something

01:24:01.653 --> 01:24:04.921
and he refuses you can
kind of imagine Americans

01:24:04.921 --> 01:24:09.542
rising up or and saying,
wait a minute our system

01:24:09.542 --> 01:24:12.025
is that the Supreme Court
is the ultimate arbiter

01:24:12.025 --> 01:24:14.737
of national law and people have accepted

01:24:14.737 --> 01:24:18.441
that for generations and we
regard it as illegitimate

01:24:18.441 --> 01:24:21.720
for you to violate a
Supreme Court directive.

01:24:21.720 --> 01:24:23.887
And that would be classic.

01:24:24.948 --> 01:24:27.738
But I guess I think that
those sorts of beliefs

01:24:27.738 --> 01:24:31.624
that some institution
is really right or good,

01:24:31.624 --> 01:24:33.874
or that the people currently running it

01:24:33.874 --> 01:24:37.522
are right or good, that
often really doesn't exist.

01:24:37.522 --> 01:24:39.873
And again with my, when I, hanging out

01:24:39.873 --> 01:24:41.728
in sub-Saharan Africa
and I'd say to people,

01:24:41.728 --> 01:24:43.081
oh you know what do you
think of your chief?

01:24:43.081 --> 01:24:46.064
And oh pew, they didn't use that term.

01:24:46.064 --> 01:24:49.210
But they'd say, oh you know he just comes

01:24:49.210 --> 01:24:50.528
he comes to every funeral.

01:24:50.528 --> 01:24:53.321
Chiefs can't eat at a funeral because

01:24:53.321 --> 01:24:54.673
it has to do with witchcraft beliefs,

01:24:54.673 --> 01:24:55.974
anyway they don't eat food.

01:24:55.974 --> 01:24:57.948
But he said that he
comes and he doesn't eat,

01:24:57.948 --> 01:25:00.651
but he brings his 10
councilors and they eat

01:25:00.651 --> 01:25:03.364
you out of house and
home and this very vital

01:25:03.364 --> 01:25:05.424
thing for people who are very, very poor.

01:25:05.424 --> 01:25:07.656
And then, so I said to this guy,

01:25:07.656 --> 01:25:11.867
so well then why don't you
just refuse to obey him?

01:25:11.867 --> 01:25:14.582
He just looked at me as
if I was out of my mind.

01:25:14.582 --> 01:25:17.063
He looked at me as
literally I mean I think

01:25:17.063 --> 01:25:19.019
he couldn't believe I said such a thing,

01:25:19.019 --> 01:25:20.544
and the reason was he said,

01:25:20.544 --> 01:25:24.787
but what if, what if, and he
could hardly get the words out,

01:25:24.787 --> 01:25:26.368
what if someone died?

01:25:26.368 --> 01:25:28.103
And what he was saying is that

01:25:28.103 --> 01:25:30.436
you couldn't bury your dead.

01:25:31.528 --> 01:25:34.605
You couldn't bury your
dead without this guy.

01:25:34.605 --> 01:25:37.728
So even if he himself is a bad chief

01:25:37.728 --> 01:25:41.228
chieftaincy it's what makes the world run.

01:25:42.912 --> 01:25:46.056
I guess if you will accept
that legitimacy doesn't mean

01:25:46.056 --> 01:25:48.990
thinking chieftaincy is good,

01:25:48.990 --> 01:25:50.597
it means thinking that chieftaincy

01:25:50.597 --> 01:25:53.158
is actually how the world runs.

01:25:53.158 --> 01:25:55.294
- [Woman] Please join me in thanking Ann.

01:25:55.294 --> 01:25:58.294
(audience applauds)

01:25:59.815 --> 01:26:02.565
(pleasant music)
