00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.840
Do I say it cheesy? The explorer in all of us!

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:09.840
and then we play the classical version of

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.520
the class course games intro.

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:23.780
Somebody's pursuits relate to an

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.740
overarching goal or story and others

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:26.519
don't

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.269
oh sorry and Andre burnt his lunch

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:31.380
actually play the game

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:39.880
[laughs] Yes.

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:42.160
Minecraft is the epitome of a sandbox game

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:46.220
[laughs] It's not 'eh-pi-tohme'?

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:47.580
'Eh-pi-tuh-mi'?

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.800
I honestly don't think I've ever seen it written

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:51.700
The epitome. [laughs]

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:56.100
While you might get similar results...hmmm...

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:02.080
With interchangeable game carntriges--interchangeable game cartridges

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:03.340
First handheld console with interchangeable game cartrages

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:09.480
*random stuff*

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:12.940
And the Gameboy wasn't exactly the most technologically advanced handheld on the market

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.800
with its blurry screen and -- woah, woah, woah

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.960
[laughs] -- sub-par graphics?!

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:21.100
woah, that's nasty talk!

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.300
Bundling the system with the incredible, popular Tetris probably helped too

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.160
and by 'probably' I mean 'YEAH.'

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.960
That is kind of funny though, it's like "we have a color screen and a portable TV"

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.220
"We've got Tetris..." AHHHHH!

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.770

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.509
