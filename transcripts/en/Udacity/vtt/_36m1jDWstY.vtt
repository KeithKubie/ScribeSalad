00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:04.600
And the answer is 205
envelopes over 10 hours.

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:07.090
But let's take a look at 205 over 10.

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:09.060
Well they each share a common factor 5.

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:11.440
205 is 5 times 41 and 10 is 5 times 2.

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:15.590
They can simplify and this means that I

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:19.900
should really write my answer as
a 41 envelopes over two hours.
