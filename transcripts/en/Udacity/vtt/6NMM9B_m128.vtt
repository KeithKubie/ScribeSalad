00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
No surprise in the implementation.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:09.000
We're subtracting step size times velocity times the estimate of the derivative

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and that estimate stems from our central-difference formula.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
In the residing diagram, you see that overall you achieved the right effect,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
the sine curve is being shifted, but we definitely need to take care of the boundary--

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
at least when our signal reaches the boundary.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
And let's try an experiment, I'm inserting the number 30 here,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:36.000
meaning that I want to start off with 30 periods of the sine--not the single period of the sine.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
And to make the image less clutter, let's use the number of 500 down here.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
This is the result that we get--we can see the artifacts at the boundaries, which we already know,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
which we already know, but there's a second phenomenon.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
We can see that the amplitude is slightly growing.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
We're growing from the blue curve to the green curve. So this looks unstable.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
The higher the frequency that we fit in, the more unstable this becomes.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
This is why I start with the sine wave and not with some rectangular function.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.000
The good thing is if we combine this way of shifting the function with diffusion,

00:01:09.000 --> 09:59:59.000
diffusion washes out the high frequencies and saves us from instability
