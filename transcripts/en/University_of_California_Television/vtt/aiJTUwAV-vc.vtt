00:00:01.174 --> 00:00:04.007
(robotic dinging)

00:00:05.262 --> 00:00:08.429
(light, upbeat music)

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.815
- I'm Dylan Penningroth, I'm a
professor of law and history,

00:00:33.815 --> 00:00:37.982
and I'm Chair of the Jefferson
Memorial Lectures Committee.

00:00:38.954 --> 00:00:42.067
These lectures were established in 1944

00:00:42.067 --> 00:00:44.576
through a bequest from Elizabeth Bonestell

00:00:44.576 --> 00:00:48.898
and her husband Cutler L.
Bonestell of San Francisco.

00:00:48.898 --> 00:00:51.559
The Bonestells cared
very deeply for history,

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:54.323
and they hoped that the
lectures would encourage

00:00:54.323 --> 00:00:57.905
students, faculty,
scholars, and area residents

00:00:57.905 --> 00:01:00.712
to study the legacy of Thomas Jefferson,

00:01:00.712 --> 00:01:04.879
and to explore values inherent
in American democracy.

00:01:05.788 --> 00:01:09.166
Past lecturers, including
Professor Annette Gordon-Reed,

00:01:09.166 --> 00:01:12.554
Senator Allen Simpson,
Senator Elizabeth Warren,

00:01:12.554 --> 00:01:16.677
Walter LaFeber, and
Archibald Cox, have delivered

00:01:16.677 --> 00:01:20.027
Jefferson Memorial Lectures
on early American history,

00:01:20.027 --> 00:01:22.778
about Jefferson himself,
and on American institutions

00:01:22.778 --> 00:01:26.945
and policies in politics,
economics, education, and law.

00:01:28.023 --> 00:01:30.886
Any event like this is a group effort,

00:01:30.886 --> 00:01:34.472
and the Committee, which is
composed of Mark Brilliant,

00:01:34.472 --> 00:01:37.397
Paul Pierson, Wendy Silver, Karen Tani,

00:01:37.397 --> 00:01:41.269
Christopher Tomlins, and
I, joins me in thanking

00:01:41.269 --> 00:01:44.327
Ellen Gobler, who you've
seen up here a minute ago,

00:01:44.327 --> 00:01:48.744
for her deft and tactful
handling of all the logistics,

00:01:48.744 --> 00:01:50.077
it is a big job.

00:01:51.738 --> 00:01:54.905
(audience applauding)

00:01:58.385 --> 00:02:00.464
We're pleased, along with
the Graduate Council,

00:02:00.464 --> 00:02:02.205
to present this year's speaker

00:02:02.205 --> 00:02:06.592
in the Jefferson Memorial
Lectures series, George Packer.

00:02:06.592 --> 00:02:10.091
Before I let him up on stage,
I wanna ask you a question,

00:02:10.091 --> 00:02:14.090
how many of you have read The New Yorker?

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:15.051
That's an easy question.

00:02:15.051 --> 00:02:17.207
(audience chuckling)

00:02:17.207 --> 00:02:20.229
How many of you have started
reading a New Yorker article

00:02:20.229 --> 00:02:22.688
and forgot what you
were doing a minute ago?

00:02:22.688 --> 00:02:25.062
(audience laughing)

00:02:25.062 --> 00:02:28.769
How many of you realized a half-hour later

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:31.938
that you still have a lecture
to write for tomorrow morning?

00:02:31.938 --> 00:02:33.588
(audience laughing)

00:02:33.588 --> 00:02:36.701
How many of you realized
half an hour later

00:02:36.701 --> 00:02:38.595
that you forgot to pick up the kids?

00:02:38.595 --> 00:02:40.580
(audience laughing)

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:42.767
I'm not gonna say whether I did that.

00:02:42.767 --> 00:02:44.828
I'm sure you can relate when I tell you

00:02:44.828 --> 00:02:48.164
that I have lost many an
hour to that magazine,

00:02:48.164 --> 00:02:50.997
and the absolute worst, the worst,

00:02:52.078 --> 00:02:54.251
were the articles by George Packer.

00:02:54.251 --> 00:02:55.294
(audience laughing)

00:02:55.294 --> 00:02:56.878
Curse you, George Packer.

00:02:56.878 --> 00:02:58.444
(audience chuckling)

00:02:58.444 --> 00:03:01.070
What makes him so good?

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:03.287
One reviewer of his latest
book, The Unwinding,

00:03:03.287 --> 00:03:06.302
quoted one of his characters
as believing that quote,

00:03:06.302 --> 00:03:08.510
"There were two kinds of journalists;

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:10.494
"the ones who told stories,

00:03:10.494 --> 00:03:13.127
"and the ones who uncovered wrongdoing.

00:03:13.127 --> 00:03:16.003
"Mr. Packer is both," the reviewer said,

00:03:16.003 --> 00:03:17.511
"and he has written something close

00:03:17.511 --> 00:03:20.443
"to a non-fiction masterpiece."

00:03:20.443 --> 00:03:23.029
I would put it this way;

00:03:23.029 --> 00:03:26.051
Packer has a rare gift
for evoking something

00:03:26.051 --> 00:03:29.819
of the spirit of an era
in the story of a life,

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:31.486
a town, or a family.

00:03:32.918 --> 00:03:36.237
He puts that gift to
work on big questions,

00:03:36.237 --> 00:03:40.237
like what has the lure
of unregulated capitalism

00:03:41.133 --> 00:03:44.399
done to America's democratic values?

00:03:44.399 --> 00:03:47.714
His writing has kaleidoscopic sweep,

00:03:47.714 --> 00:03:51.881
yet is ruthlessly precise,
and he does it all day long.

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:55.474
Not only is he a Staff
Writer for The New Yorker,

00:03:55.474 --> 00:03:58.440
he writes regularly for The
New York Times Magazine,

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:03.225
Dissent, Mother Jones, and
Harper's in his spare time.

00:04:03.225 --> 00:04:06.797
He wrote two novels, an
award-winning play, Betrayed,

00:04:06.797 --> 00:04:08.691
and five non-fiction books.

00:04:08.691 --> 00:04:11.930
One of those books, The
Assassins' Gate; America and Iraq,

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:13.469
won the New York Public Library's

00:04:13.469 --> 00:04:17.636
Helen Bernstein Book Award, and
an overseas club book award.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.661
His most recent book, The Unwinding,

00:04:21.661 --> 00:04:25.101
won the National Book
Award for non-fiction.

00:04:25.101 --> 00:04:28.019
He is currently working on a
book about Richard Holbrooke

00:04:28.019 --> 00:04:30.310
and the end of the American Century.

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:33.392
And for his Jefferson lecture
he turns from recent history,

00:04:33.392 --> 00:04:36.094
I think to our present
moment, in a talk entitled,

00:04:36.094 --> 00:04:39.493
American Identity in the Age of Trump.

00:04:39.493 --> 00:04:42.668
Please join me in welcoming
George Packer to Berkeley.

00:04:42.668 --> 00:04:45.835
(audience applauding)

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:53.523
- That was so nice, thank you.

00:04:53.523 --> 00:04:56.690
(audience applauding)

00:04:58.954 --> 00:04:59.787
Oh man.

00:05:01.863 --> 00:05:04.314
Dylan, thank you so much for that,

00:05:04.314 --> 00:05:07.546
I can't wait to talk about your work

00:05:07.546 --> 00:05:09.416
after this is all over.

00:05:09.416 --> 00:05:10.749
Enough about me.

00:05:11.847 --> 00:05:15.280
And thank you Ellen, for all
that you did to bring me here,

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:16.464
and to the Committee that brought me,

00:05:16.464 --> 00:05:18.656
it's an incredible honor to
be asked to give this lecture,

00:05:18.656 --> 00:05:22.933
and hearing my predecessors makes my spine

00:05:22.933 --> 00:05:27.049
go a little bit cold,
I'm gonna do my best.

00:05:27.049 --> 00:05:30.196
I will talk a bit about recent history,

00:05:30.196 --> 00:05:32.341
because you can't talk
about the age of Trump

00:05:32.341 --> 00:05:35.593
without going back a bit,
but first I wanna say,

00:05:35.593 --> 00:05:37.308
it's great to be back in the Bay Area,

00:05:37.308 --> 00:05:38.991
which is where I grew up.

00:05:38.991 --> 00:05:42.158
(audience applauding)

00:05:43.121 --> 00:05:46.331
It's also weird to be at
Cal during big game week,

00:05:46.331 --> 00:05:47.913
because I grew up at Stanford,

00:05:47.913 --> 00:05:50.181
when you were the enemy.

00:05:50.181 --> 00:05:53.264
(audience chuckling)

00:05:55.506 --> 00:05:58.850
So almost 10 years ago I
set out to write a book

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:01.761
about what happened to
America over the generation

00:06:01.761 --> 00:06:05.160
that coincided with my adult life.

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:07.242
That was a large subject,
and large subjects

00:06:07.242 --> 00:06:11.253
are best approached through small dramas.

00:06:11.253 --> 00:06:13.879
I wanted to create a
portrait of the country

00:06:13.879 --> 00:06:16.699
through the stories of
a handful of Americans.

00:06:16.699 --> 00:06:18.405
It was the depths of the Great Recession,

00:06:18.405 --> 00:06:20.467
I began traveling around the country,

00:06:20.467 --> 00:06:23.455
sometimes as a New Yorker magazine writer,

00:06:23.455 --> 00:06:25.537
more often on my own dime,

00:06:25.537 --> 00:06:27.111
mainly to out-of-the-way places

00:06:27.111 --> 00:06:29.666
that the media tend to overlook;

00:06:29.666 --> 00:06:32.201
the tobacco and textile region

00:06:32.201 --> 00:06:34.318
of the North Carolina Piedmont,

00:06:34.318 --> 00:06:37.668
the decayed industrial
city of Youngstown, Ohio,

00:06:37.668 --> 00:06:39.548
the new subdivisions around Tampa Bay,

00:06:39.548 --> 00:06:43.309
which almost overnight had
become ghost subdivisions.

00:06:43.309 --> 00:06:46.784
I met people in this places
who became what writers call

00:06:46.784 --> 00:06:50.642
characters, meaning the
subjects of stories.

00:06:50.642 --> 00:06:53.247
They weren't famous, they
thought of themselves

00:06:53.247 --> 00:06:55.653
as so ordinary that some
of them couldn't understand

00:06:55.653 --> 00:06:57.548
why I was interested.

00:06:57.548 --> 00:07:00.166
But they let me spend
months following them,

00:07:00.166 --> 00:07:02.081
asking them impertinent questions,

00:07:02.081 --> 00:07:03.996
getting to know them in a deeper way

00:07:03.996 --> 00:07:06.601
than a single interview would've allowed.

00:07:06.601 --> 00:07:08.530
I liked listening to them, I liked them,

00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:10.327
and they knew how to hold my attention,

00:07:10.327 --> 00:07:12.485
plus they were willing to put up with me.

00:07:12.485 --> 00:07:16.323
Their stories allowed me
to get at my bigger theme;

00:07:16.323 --> 00:07:20.668
the decline of America's
democratic institutions.

00:07:20.668 --> 00:07:22.214
In a way it's always satisfying

00:07:22.214 --> 00:07:26.427
to have one's preconceived ideas upended.

00:07:26.427 --> 00:07:30.251
While I was doing my reporting,
I kept meeting Americans

00:07:30.251 --> 00:07:34.276
who didn't match the
familiar Red-Blue scheme.

00:07:34.276 --> 00:07:37.256
They might be white,
Southern country people,

00:07:37.256 --> 00:07:40.156
but they hated corporations
and big-box stores,

00:07:40.156 --> 00:07:42.718
as well as the federal government.

00:07:42.718 --> 00:07:45.706
There was the lawyer who kept
imagining, almost welcoming,

00:07:45.706 --> 00:07:48.886
an apocalyptic vision of armed citizens

00:07:48.886 --> 00:07:51.546
turning to political violence.

00:07:51.546 --> 00:07:53.517
There was the black community organizer

00:07:53.517 --> 00:07:56.553
who talked down the
mentality of victimhood,

00:07:56.553 --> 00:07:59.346
and there was the ex-lobbyist
who wanted to punish

00:07:59.346 --> 00:08:02.502
Wall Street executives
with sweeping legal reforms

00:08:02.502 --> 00:08:04.085
and jail sentences.

00:08:04.975 --> 00:08:07.482
They followed the Tea
Party, but sounded a little

00:08:07.482 --> 00:08:11.117
like Occupy Wall Street, or visa versa.

00:08:11.117 --> 00:08:15.284
They were loose molecules,
attached to no party hierarchy,

00:08:16.646 --> 00:08:19.216
more individualistic than Democrats,

00:08:19.216 --> 00:08:23.046
more anti-business than Republicans.

00:08:23.046 --> 00:08:26.097
Now, the Left-Right division wasn't wrong,

00:08:26.097 --> 00:08:29.210
there was no centrist silent majority

00:08:29.210 --> 00:08:32.953
waiting to elect Michael
Bloomberg president.

00:08:32.953 --> 00:08:36.365
Americans, aided by cable
news and social media,

00:08:36.365 --> 00:08:39.515
have sorted themselves
geographically and mentally

00:08:39.515 --> 00:08:44.049
into mutually-hostile and
incomprehensible worlds.

00:08:44.049 --> 00:08:47.935
By some measures, political
polarization is wider,

00:08:47.935 --> 00:08:50.449
and fiercer, than at any
time since the run up

00:08:50.449 --> 00:08:52.872
to the Civil War, and
political scientists have taken

00:08:52.872 --> 00:08:56.663
to estimating the chances of
a second one breaking out;

00:08:56.663 --> 00:08:59.866
some of them give it about 30%.

00:08:59.866 --> 00:09:02.255
If you graph this polarization,

00:09:02.255 --> 00:09:06.008
using data like voting
patterns in Congress,

00:09:06.008 --> 00:09:09.449
it tracks quite closely with
two other major phenomena

00:09:09.449 --> 00:09:11.447
of the past 40 years;

00:09:11.447 --> 00:09:13.752
rising levels of inequality,

00:09:13.752 --> 00:09:17.032
and rising levels of immigration.

00:09:17.032 --> 00:09:20.800
These trends start to increase
in the mid to late 70s,

00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:24.038
and continue right up to the present.

00:09:24.038 --> 00:09:26.559
It's an important task to figure out

00:09:26.559 --> 00:09:29.547
what the trend lines have
to do with one another.

00:09:29.547 --> 00:09:33.008
Why was postwar America,
with a broad middle class,

00:09:33.008 --> 00:09:37.381
wider distribution of wealth,
stronger institutions,

00:09:37.381 --> 00:09:40.835
more ethnic homogeneity, and higher levels

00:09:40.835 --> 00:09:44.143
of political participation less polarized

00:09:44.143 --> 00:09:46.518
than America today?

00:09:46.518 --> 00:09:50.341
The simple answer, I think,
is that a smaller pie

00:09:50.341 --> 00:09:53.377
divided into less and less equal slices

00:09:53.377 --> 00:09:56.114
among people who look less and less alike,

00:09:56.114 --> 00:10:00.197
drives them towards cynical
and hateful extremes.

00:10:01.511 --> 00:10:04.248
My point for now is that the Red-Blue map

00:10:04.248 --> 00:10:07.684
could be redrawn in a new
way that would explain

00:10:07.684 --> 00:10:09.480
the political landscape differently,

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:12.563
and perhaps more accurately; up-down.

00:10:13.624 --> 00:10:17.238
From this point of view,
the affluent on each side

00:10:17.238 --> 00:10:21.152
of the partisan divide have
more in common with one another

00:10:21.152 --> 00:10:23.896
than they do with the voters below them.

00:10:23.896 --> 00:10:25.908
A network systems administrator,

00:10:25.908 --> 00:10:29.133
an oil and gas company vice
president, a journalist,

00:10:29.133 --> 00:10:33.193
and a dermatologist hire
nannies from the same countries,

00:10:33.193 --> 00:10:35.944
dine out at the same Thai restaurants,

00:10:35.944 --> 00:10:39.265
travel abroad on the same
frequent flier miles,

00:10:39.265 --> 00:10:43.420
and invest in the same
emerging market's index funds.

00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:44.917
They might have different political views,

00:10:44.917 --> 00:10:46.826
but they share a common interest

00:10:46.826 --> 00:10:50.659
in the existing global
order and its survival.

00:10:52.153 --> 00:10:55.085
For those in the lower
half, or two-thirds,

00:10:55.085 --> 00:10:58.462
globalization doesn't
have much of an upside.

00:10:58.462 --> 00:11:00.823
It might lower prices at Walmart,

00:11:00.823 --> 00:11:02.857
but it will give their job to a robot,

00:11:02.857 --> 00:11:06.285
or a foreigner, or
eliminate it altogether.

00:11:06.285 --> 00:11:10.185
The Americans I met in these
ranks were unorganized,

00:11:10.185 --> 00:11:15.018
unheard, unspoken for, and
they were sinking, alone.

00:11:15.018 --> 00:11:17.595
They were part of a
trend toward geographic

00:11:17.595 --> 00:11:22.226
and social immobility in
towns and rural areas.

00:11:22.226 --> 00:11:25.123
Isolation was a common condition.

00:11:25.123 --> 00:11:26.843
Among all the people I wrote about,

00:11:26.843 --> 00:11:29.016
the only one with a network of relations

00:11:29.016 --> 00:11:31.467
that could provide help when she needed it

00:11:31.467 --> 00:11:33.410
was an Indian immigrant in Tampa

00:11:33.410 --> 00:11:36.358
who managed to save her
motel from bank foreclosure

00:11:36.358 --> 00:11:39.236
thanks to her extended family in Florida,

00:11:39.236 --> 00:11:41.465
England, and Gujarat.

00:11:41.465 --> 00:11:45.908
The native-born Americans
were pretty much on their own.

00:11:45.908 --> 00:11:49.273
Another family in Tampa, the
Hartzells, who are white,

00:11:49.273 --> 00:11:51.286
had no support of any kind

00:11:51.286 --> 00:11:54.119
from friends, or family, or institutions.

00:11:54.119 --> 00:11:55.875
They were always on the
edge of homelessness,

00:11:55.875 --> 00:11:57.495
and in fact, eventually they were living

00:11:57.495 --> 00:12:00.406
with their two children
in their broken-down car

00:12:00.406 --> 00:12:03.150
in a Walmart parking lot.

00:12:03.150 --> 00:12:05.106
Since most of the stores
in their neighborhood

00:12:05.106 --> 00:12:07.142
were owned by Asians and Latinos,

00:12:07.142 --> 00:12:09.942
the Harzells clung to the
belief that immigrants received

00:12:09.942 --> 00:12:11.852
seven years of government benefits

00:12:11.852 --> 00:12:13.943
after arriving in America,

00:12:13.943 --> 00:12:17.091
an unfair advantage, they thought.

00:12:17.091 --> 00:12:19.939
Danny Hartzell was
trapped by the uncertainty

00:12:19.939 --> 00:12:23.038
of part time work in a Target stockroom,

00:12:23.038 --> 00:12:25.143
with a schedule that
changed from day-to-day

00:12:25.143 --> 00:12:26.759
at the company's convenience,

00:12:26.759 --> 00:12:28.911
and sometimes reduced his weekly hours

00:12:28.911 --> 00:12:31.529
to the vanishing point.

00:12:31.529 --> 00:12:34.461
In Studs Terkel's oral history Working,

00:12:34.461 --> 00:12:37.996
written in the early
70s, people were trapped

00:12:37.996 --> 00:12:40.357
in monotonous jobs they hated

00:12:40.357 --> 00:12:43.003
that turned them into numbers and cogs;

00:12:43.003 --> 00:12:46.336
today that looks like enviable security.

00:12:47.823 --> 00:12:49.703
The people I wrote about believed

00:12:49.703 --> 00:12:52.003
that the middle class was gone,

00:12:52.003 --> 00:12:55.339
that the game was rigged for
the powerful and connected,

00:12:55.339 --> 00:12:58.020
and that their children were screwed.

00:12:58.020 --> 00:13:01.760
They saw money going to the
top, or out of the country,

00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:04.880
or to the undeserving down below.

00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:07.985
There was a pervasive fear of scams,

00:13:07.985 --> 00:13:11.210
and a longing for simple explanations,

00:13:11.210 --> 00:13:14.794
and these feelings can
easily turn to anxiety,

00:13:14.794 --> 00:13:18.175
nostalgia, and an impulse
to blame the other;

00:13:18.175 --> 00:13:22.342
black Americans, coastal urban
elites, Muslims, immigrants.

00:13:24.053 --> 00:13:27.328
The institutions of a
middle class democracy,

00:13:27.328 --> 00:13:31.817
government, business,
media, university, bank,

00:13:31.817 --> 00:13:35.877
union, church, civic group, were remote

00:13:35.877 --> 00:13:40.737
and seemed geared for the
benefit of those who ran them.

00:13:40.737 --> 00:13:44.359
And no institution has been
guiltier of this abandonment

00:13:44.359 --> 00:13:46.942
than the two political parties.

00:13:48.630 --> 00:13:50.162
Over the course of the 20th century,

00:13:50.162 --> 00:13:52.727
and I'm really going to oversimplify here,

00:13:52.727 --> 00:13:55.164
the Democrats were the
party of the fair shake,

00:13:55.164 --> 00:13:58.747
the Republicans the
party of getting ahead.

00:13:59.699 --> 00:14:01.250
They represented respectively,

00:14:01.250 --> 00:14:03.430
the interests of workers and business,

00:14:03.430 --> 00:14:07.483
and this continued all
the way into the late 60s,

00:14:07.483 --> 00:14:10.614
and then two big changes happened.

00:14:10.614 --> 00:14:13.957
On the Democratic side,
after the '68 Convention,

00:14:13.957 --> 00:14:17.439
reform shrank the power of
unions and urban machines,

00:14:17.439 --> 00:14:19.790
and increased the power
of what was then called

00:14:19.790 --> 00:14:22.642
the New Politics, which was more concerned

00:14:22.642 --> 00:14:24.951
with the rights of disenfranchised groups

00:14:24.951 --> 00:14:27.954
and issues like the
environment, militarism,

00:14:27.954 --> 00:14:30.467
and government corruption.

00:14:30.467 --> 00:14:32.354
Then came the Atari Democrats,

00:14:32.354 --> 00:14:33.670
I think they're the subject of a book

00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:37.316
that someone who invited
me here is writing,

00:14:37.316 --> 00:14:40.733
and that led to Bill Clinton and the 90s,

00:14:41.815 --> 00:14:44.312
when the party embraced globalization

00:14:44.312 --> 00:14:48.176
as the way of the future,
and education as the key

00:14:48.176 --> 00:14:51.277
to personal and national success.

00:14:51.277 --> 00:14:55.775
In 2000, at a White House
conference on the new economy,

00:14:55.775 --> 00:14:58.770
Clinton said that the internet
would be the greatest engine

00:14:58.770 --> 00:15:02.298
for reducing poverty in
the history of the world;

00:15:02.298 --> 00:15:05.426
things didn't quite turn out like that.

00:15:05.426 --> 00:15:07.961
And on the Republican side there was also

00:15:07.961 --> 00:15:10.378
an immense change in the 70s.

00:15:12.798 --> 00:15:16.881
Beginning then, and
preceding in the years since,

00:15:18.579 --> 00:15:22.306
it's had an increasingly shaky marriage

00:15:22.306 --> 00:15:25.667
between the interests of the
rich and downscale whites,

00:15:25.667 --> 00:15:29.018
many of them evangelical Christians.

00:15:29.018 --> 00:15:31.433
From being the boring party of Babbitt

00:15:31.433 --> 00:15:34.693
and conservative order,
Republicans were seized

00:15:34.693 --> 00:15:37.417
with a new populist energy.

00:15:37.417 --> 00:15:39.850
Beginning with the
Civil Rights Act of '64,

00:15:39.850 --> 00:15:42.144
surging with the Reagan
Democrats of the 80s,

00:15:42.144 --> 00:15:44.359
and culminating in the
most recent election,

00:15:44.359 --> 00:15:47.734
the Republican Party became
a kind of worker's party,

00:15:47.734 --> 00:15:51.326
but only white workers,
and led, strangely enough,

00:15:51.326 --> 00:15:53.869
by the Koch brothers.

00:15:53.869 --> 00:15:56.080
For a long time it seemed
like a winning coalition

00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:59.355
with a powerful ideology,
but it was stained

00:15:59.355 --> 00:16:02.531
by annihilism that came from the top

00:16:02.531 --> 00:16:05.882
and sludged downward to the grassroots.

00:16:05.882 --> 00:16:10.794
It fed on rage, and the spectacle
of celebrity pop culture.

00:16:10.794 --> 00:16:14.046
Media demagogues like Limbaugh, Drudge,

00:16:14.046 --> 00:16:17.287
Brietbart, Coulter,
Hannity, came on the scene

00:16:17.287 --> 00:16:20.170
with all the viciousness
of the 30s radio broadcasts

00:16:20.170 --> 00:16:22.411
of Father Coughlin.

00:16:22.411 --> 00:16:25.203
Republican office holders
found the will to deploy

00:16:25.203 --> 00:16:28.870
every available weapon;
investigation, impeachment,

00:16:28.870 --> 00:16:32.989
Supreme Court, filibuster,
government shut down,

00:16:32.989 --> 00:16:37.102
conspiracy theories, and even
implied threats of violence

00:16:37.102 --> 00:16:40.898
to secure power and destroy
their political enemies.

00:16:40.898 --> 00:16:42.800
So the most important
political development

00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:46.241
of my adult life has been
this descending nihilism

00:16:46.241 --> 00:16:47.324
of the Right.

00:16:49.282 --> 00:16:53.269
In the Fall of 2008 I was
reporting on the election

00:16:53.269 --> 00:16:55.420
in a little town called Glouster, Ohio.

00:16:55.420 --> 00:16:58.049
I sat down with a group
of women who were excited

00:16:58.049 --> 00:17:01.045
by politics for the first
time in their lives.

00:17:01.045 --> 00:17:04.289
The reason was named Sarah Palin.

00:17:04.289 --> 00:17:07.100
She'd fit right in with us, they said.

00:17:07.100 --> 00:17:09.696
Something new had happened
in Republican politics,

00:17:09.696 --> 00:17:11.831
populism had taken over.

00:17:11.831 --> 00:17:15.532
Being a Wasilla Walmart mom
had become a qualification

00:17:15.532 --> 00:17:19.699
for high office; for some,
the main qualification.

00:17:20.573 --> 00:17:24.248
Palin's campaign appearances
turned working class whiteness

00:17:24.248 --> 00:17:26.436
into identity politics.

00:17:26.436 --> 00:17:29.583
She strutted on stage to the
beat of Gretchen Wilson's

00:17:29.583 --> 00:17:32.518
Redneck Woman, she even had a pregnant,

00:17:32.518 --> 00:17:34.888
unwed teenage daughter.

00:17:34.888 --> 00:17:38.797
In her proud ignorance, her
contempt for institutions,

00:17:38.797 --> 00:17:41.491
her infatuation with her own celebrity,

00:17:41.491 --> 00:17:43.641
and her unrestrained narcissism,

00:17:43.641 --> 00:17:47.308
Palin was John The
Baptist for Donald Trump.

00:17:48.389 --> 00:17:50.372
(audience murmuring and chuckling)

00:17:50.372 --> 00:17:54.648
I didn't mean for that
be an applause line.

00:17:54.648 --> 00:17:57.623
What happened to our institutions?

00:17:57.623 --> 00:17:59.804
In brief, they stopped
meeting the aspirations

00:17:59.804 --> 00:18:02.506
of those at the bottom,
while those at the top

00:18:02.506 --> 00:18:06.742
stopped believing in interests
larger than their own.

00:18:06.742 --> 00:18:09.995
We can't live without
elites, for better or worse,

00:18:09.995 --> 00:18:12.304
but elites with no sense of responsibility

00:18:12.304 --> 00:18:15.066
are the worst case scenario.

00:18:15.066 --> 00:18:16.820
They didn't used to be better people,

00:18:16.820 --> 00:18:20.140
human nature doesn't change,
but they were held in check

00:18:20.140 --> 00:18:23.460
by certain taboos and social constraints.

00:18:23.460 --> 00:18:26.675
Today our elites and the
institutions they lead

00:18:26.675 --> 00:18:30.101
have largely been replaced by celebrities.

00:18:30.101 --> 00:18:33.014
Celebrities dominate
ordinary people's lives

00:18:33.014 --> 00:18:35.368
like household gods.

00:18:35.368 --> 00:18:38.409
In times of widespread opportunity

00:18:38.409 --> 00:18:40.627
the distance between these gods

00:18:40.627 --> 00:18:43.540
and ordinary mortals
closes; the monuments shrink

00:18:43.540 --> 00:18:46.188
closer to human size,
and the lives of America,

00:18:46.188 --> 00:18:49.553
celebrities are gossipy diversions.

00:18:49.553 --> 00:18:52.549
But they loom larger in times like now,

00:18:52.549 --> 00:18:56.928
when inequality is high,
trust in institutions is low,

00:18:56.928 --> 00:19:00.671
and the normal paths of
upward mobility are blocked.

00:19:00.671 --> 00:19:03.712
Extreme celebrity worship
speaks of a weakening

00:19:03.712 --> 00:19:06.519
of ordinary people's
faith in self-government,

00:19:06.519 --> 00:19:10.262
it's a symptom of democratic decay.

00:19:10.262 --> 00:19:13.054
Our celebrities all live
by the Hacker's Code,

00:19:13.054 --> 00:19:15.905
ask forgiveness, not permission.

00:19:15.905 --> 00:19:18.290
They obliterate old distinctions

00:19:18.290 --> 00:19:20.289
between high and low culture,

00:19:20.289 --> 00:19:24.387
profit-making and philanthropy,
business and politics,

00:19:24.387 --> 00:19:28.364
leading to the phenomenon of
being famous for being famous.

00:19:28.364 --> 00:19:31.246
The inevitable next step
is for Kim Kardashian

00:19:31.246 --> 00:19:33.525
to sit on the board of a tech startup,

00:19:33.525 --> 00:19:35.457
host a global poverty awareness event,

00:19:35.457 --> 00:19:38.136
and write a book on popular neuroscience.

00:19:38.136 --> 00:19:39.622
(audience laughing)

00:19:39.622 --> 00:19:43.372
Or, for Donald Trump to
be elected president.

00:19:44.409 --> 00:19:46.066
Given the landscape I've described,

00:19:46.066 --> 00:19:48.891
it should not have come
as a complete surprise

00:19:48.891 --> 00:19:51.110
when millions of Americans
were suddenly drawn

00:19:51.110 --> 00:19:54.607
to a crass, strongman who
tossed out fraudulent promises

00:19:54.607 --> 00:19:59.082
and gave institutions and
elites the middle finger.

00:19:59.082 --> 00:20:02.063
My book certainly didn't predict Trump,

00:20:02.063 --> 00:20:04.357
but it described the early warning signs

00:20:04.357 --> 00:20:06.607
of something like Trumpism.

00:20:07.647 --> 00:20:11.201
The fact that so many informed,
sophisticated Americans

00:20:11.201 --> 00:20:14.642
not only failed to see him
coming, but kept writing him off

00:20:14.642 --> 00:20:17.577
throughout the campaign, and
in a sense still regard him

00:20:17.577 --> 00:20:20.802
as a ludicrous aberration,
is itself a sign

00:20:20.802 --> 00:20:24.650
of a democracy in which no center holds.

00:20:24.650 --> 00:20:27.231
Most of his critics are too reasonable

00:20:27.231 --> 00:20:29.842
to fathom his kind of politics.

00:20:29.842 --> 00:20:31.819
Some don't know a single Trump supporter,

00:20:31.819 --> 00:20:36.731
but to fight Trump, you have
to understand his appeal.

00:20:36.731 --> 00:20:38.822
During the campaign, I
interviewed a steel worker

00:20:38.822 --> 00:20:41.312
outside Canton, Ohio.

00:20:41.312 --> 00:20:44.323
He was on a picket line
as a result of a lock out,

00:20:44.323 --> 00:20:46.134
facing months without a paycheck,

00:20:46.134 --> 00:20:47.739
possibly the loss of his job,

00:20:47.739 --> 00:20:50.468
and he talked about the
end of the middle class,

00:20:50.468 --> 00:20:53.663
which had become a familiar subject to me.

00:20:53.663 --> 00:20:56.442
He struck me as a decent, thoughtful man,

00:20:56.442 --> 00:20:59.273
but he found Trump's
endless insults refreshing,

00:20:59.273 --> 00:21:01.046
even exhilarating.

00:21:01.046 --> 00:21:03.951
The ugliness was a kind
of revenge, he said,

00:21:03.951 --> 00:21:07.460
it's a mirror of the way they see us.

00:21:07.460 --> 00:21:10.546
He didn't specify who they and us were,

00:21:10.546 --> 00:21:13.248
but maybe he didn't have
to, maybe he included me

00:21:13.248 --> 00:21:14.787
among the they.

00:21:14.787 --> 00:21:17.544
Maybe he believed, he was
far too polite to say it,

00:21:17.544 --> 00:21:19.001
that people like me didn't give a shit

00:21:19.001 --> 00:21:20.795
about people like him.

00:21:20.795 --> 00:21:23.157
Maybe he didn't care that
Trump's friend and advisor,

00:21:23.157 --> 00:21:25.363
Carl Icahn, was responsible for the loss

00:21:25.363 --> 00:21:27.831
of hundreds of factory jobs in Canton,

00:21:27.831 --> 00:21:30.057
resulting from leveraged buyouts;

00:21:30.057 --> 00:21:34.192
what mattered was that
Trump spoke for him.

00:21:34.192 --> 00:21:36.743
"I am your voice," Trump declared

00:21:36.743 --> 00:21:39.173
at the Republican Convention.

00:21:39.173 --> 00:21:43.014
Democrats scoffed, but
it was powerful stuff.

00:21:43.014 --> 00:21:45.806
The lower Trump's language
and behavior sank,

00:21:45.806 --> 00:21:49.058
and the more he was vilified
by the media and other elites,

00:21:49.058 --> 00:21:52.114
the more he was celebrated by his tribe.

00:21:52.114 --> 00:21:57.042
Trump is the leader, and
the leader can do no wrong.

00:21:57.042 --> 00:21:58.883
During the election we learned

00:21:58.883 --> 00:22:00.505
that lots of Republican voters

00:22:00.505 --> 00:22:02.946
are not constitutional originalists,

00:22:02.946 --> 00:22:04.759
members of the Federalist Society,

00:22:04.759 --> 00:22:09.071
or devout readers of the Wall
Street Journal editorial page;

00:22:09.071 --> 00:22:11.701
they actually want
government to do more things

00:22:11.701 --> 00:22:14.817
that benefit them, as
opposed to benefiting people

00:22:14.817 --> 00:22:16.817
they see as undeserving.

00:22:17.715 --> 00:22:20.009
Party leaders should have
anticipated Trump's rise,

00:22:20.009 --> 00:22:23.224
after all, he was created in
their laboratory of populism

00:22:23.224 --> 00:22:27.672
before he broke free and began
to smash everything in sight.

00:22:27.672 --> 00:22:29.472
Trump showed that the Republican party

00:22:29.472 --> 00:22:32.875
hasn't been truly conservative,
or truly Christian,

00:22:32.875 --> 00:22:34.750
for many years.

00:22:34.750 --> 00:22:36.708
Its most energized elements are not trying

00:22:36.708 --> 00:22:39.976
to restore stability or institute virtue,

00:22:39.976 --> 00:22:43.334
they're driven by a sense
of violent opposition

00:22:43.334 --> 00:22:46.028
against changes in color
and culture that appear

00:22:46.028 --> 00:22:49.318
to be sweeping away the
country they once knew,

00:22:49.318 --> 00:22:52.253
against globalization,
which turns out to be

00:22:52.253 --> 00:22:55.249
a political program, as
revolutionary and threatening

00:22:55.249 --> 00:22:56.992
as the politics of the Jacobins

00:22:56.992 --> 00:22:59.409
and the anarchists once were.

00:23:00.259 --> 00:23:02.809
None of this happened in isolation;

00:23:02.809 --> 00:23:06.212
the populist impulse that
brought Trump to power

00:23:06.212 --> 00:23:07.820
has taken hold throughout Europe

00:23:07.820 --> 00:23:10.423
and the rest of the democratic world.

00:23:10.423 --> 00:23:14.151
From Spain and Britain
to Sweden and Poland,

00:23:14.151 --> 00:23:18.318
from Germany's Alternative fur
Deutschland, to India's BJP,

00:23:19.244 --> 00:23:22.661
from Hungary's Orban to Turkey's Erdogan.

00:23:23.530 --> 00:23:27.071
This global reaction against globalism

00:23:27.071 --> 00:23:28.879
is described in the work of the Harvard

00:23:28.879 --> 00:23:31.459
political scientist Yascha Mounk.

00:23:31.459 --> 00:23:33.489
He writes that the failure of democracies

00:23:33.489 --> 00:23:37.971
over the past generation to
provide rising living standards,

00:23:37.971 --> 00:23:39.679
along with mass immigration

00:23:39.679 --> 00:23:42.706
and the advent of weaponized social media,

00:23:42.706 --> 00:23:46.706
have split apart what seemed
like an inseparable idea,

00:23:46.706 --> 00:23:49.717
liberal democracy, into
two kinds of polity,

00:23:49.717 --> 00:23:52.539
both of them harmful to the
values of self-government.

00:23:52.539 --> 00:23:55.331
On one hand, undemocratic liberalism,

00:23:55.331 --> 00:23:57.391
such as the European Union

00:23:57.391 --> 00:23:59.692
and international trade agreements,

00:23:59.692 --> 00:24:02.047
which protect individual rights,

00:24:02.047 --> 00:24:04.897
but are unresponsive to the popular will.

00:24:04.897 --> 00:24:07.382
And on the other hand,
illiberal democracy,

00:24:07.382 --> 00:24:09.661
such as the governments
of Hungary and Turkey,

00:24:09.661 --> 00:24:12.641
where the people vote for
leaders who trample the rights

00:24:12.641 --> 00:24:16.037
of individuals and minorities,
marginalize free media

00:24:16.037 --> 00:24:18.414
and free speech, and opposition parties,

00:24:18.414 --> 00:24:21.081
and ultimately become autocrats.

00:24:22.753 --> 00:24:24.723
People in Europe and
elsewhere have a history

00:24:24.723 --> 00:24:26.899
with this kind of politics.

00:24:26.899 --> 00:24:29.239
At it's most virulent in the 20s and 30s,

00:24:29.239 --> 00:24:32.265
it took the form of Fascism.

00:24:32.265 --> 00:24:35.804
But in spite of Joe McCarthy,
and The Plot Against America,

00:24:35.804 --> 00:24:38.573
and It Can't Happen Here, we Americans

00:24:38.573 --> 00:24:40.897
really don't know it very well.

00:24:40.897 --> 00:24:43.108
Democracy has always been our creed,

00:24:43.108 --> 00:24:44.964
and even the two times when it came

00:24:44.964 --> 00:24:47.689
under existential threat
during the Civil War

00:24:47.689 --> 00:24:51.477
and the Great Depression, we
continued to hold elections

00:24:51.477 --> 00:24:54.269
with the usual political
parties, and we amended

00:24:54.269 --> 00:24:57.453
rather than discarded our Constitution.

00:24:57.453 --> 00:25:00.879
No one ever got very
far in American politics

00:25:00.879 --> 00:25:03.629
by trashing democracy, until now.

00:25:06.010 --> 00:25:09.579
No one cause explains the 2016 election,

00:25:09.579 --> 00:25:14.084
it was too monumental for
that, it was about many things.

00:25:14.084 --> 00:25:15.895
It was about race;

00:25:15.895 --> 00:25:18.182
after eight years under a black president,

00:25:18.182 --> 00:25:21.819
Trump won in every
category of white voters

00:25:21.819 --> 00:25:25.569
regardless of income,
education, age, or sex.

00:25:26.837 --> 00:25:31.372
It was about immigrants; they
were Trump's favorite target.

00:25:31.372 --> 00:25:32.934
He didn't do well in places that have

00:25:32.934 --> 00:25:36.081
a long experience of
immigration, he did best

00:25:36.081 --> 00:25:39.077
among white Americans in
places that are experiencing

00:25:39.077 --> 00:25:42.382
non-white immigration for the first time.

00:25:42.382 --> 00:25:45.016
He did terribly in Los
Angeles and in Queens,

00:25:45.016 --> 00:25:48.479
but he crushed it in northwestern Iowa.

00:25:48.479 --> 00:25:52.690
2016 was about gender;
the level of sheer hatred

00:25:52.690 --> 00:25:57.180
directed at Clinton continues
to defy all explanations

00:25:57.180 --> 00:25:59.347
of personality and emails.

00:26:00.515 --> 00:26:05.035
The election was about the
vast urban-rural divide,

00:26:05.035 --> 00:26:07.948
and it was about economic anxiety,

00:26:07.948 --> 00:26:10.430
not necessarily economic hardship;

00:26:10.430 --> 00:26:13.622
Trump supporters had a
slightly higher average income

00:26:13.622 --> 00:26:16.184
than those who viewed him unfavorably,

00:26:16.184 --> 00:26:18.802
but they had low levels of education,

00:26:18.802 --> 00:26:22.470
of social capital and
mobility, and of hope.

00:26:22.470 --> 00:26:24.869
They saw their communities going down,

00:26:24.869 --> 00:26:27.194
and their children and
neighbors struggling,

00:26:27.194 --> 00:26:29.518
and they didn't believe
that the political elites

00:26:29.518 --> 00:26:33.671
would, or even wanted,
to do anything about it.

00:26:33.671 --> 00:26:36.230
A great deal of effort and argument

00:26:36.230 --> 00:26:39.565
has gone into weighing and
measuring these different factors

00:26:39.565 --> 00:26:42.312
like a contest to declare the winner.

00:26:42.312 --> 00:26:45.587
I'm not even going to try, I'd only say

00:26:45.587 --> 00:26:50.575
they tend to go together, and
they reinforce one another.

00:26:50.575 --> 00:26:52.416
Eight and a half million Americans

00:26:52.416 --> 00:26:54.830
who voted for President Obama in 2012

00:26:54.830 --> 00:26:56.830
voted for Trump in 2016.

00:26:58.094 --> 00:27:00.742
He beat Clinton because
he did better than Romney,

00:27:00.742 --> 00:27:03.572
and she did worse than
Obama in key counties

00:27:03.572 --> 00:27:07.639
of the upper Midwest, North
Carolina, and Florida.

00:27:07.639 --> 00:27:10.152
The voters who swung from Obama to Trump

00:27:10.152 --> 00:27:13.593
were whites without a college degree.

00:27:13.593 --> 00:27:17.526
Altogether the election
was about alienation.

00:27:17.526 --> 00:27:19.787
This alienation goes
beyond whether you're for

00:27:19.787 --> 00:27:23.153
or against Obamacare, it
actually has very little

00:27:23.153 --> 00:27:25.153
to do with policy.

00:27:25.153 --> 00:27:28.502
I interviewed Hillary Clinton
a month before the election,

00:27:28.502 --> 00:27:30.449
and she laid out numerous ideas

00:27:30.449 --> 00:27:32.879
for making the economy more fair,

00:27:32.879 --> 00:27:35.233
and bringing back manufacturing jobs,

00:27:35.233 --> 00:27:37.807
and forcing corporations
to be more responsible,

00:27:37.807 --> 00:27:40.191
and breaking up monopolies.

00:27:40.191 --> 00:27:42.711
As Clinton spoke I remember
thinking two things;

00:27:42.711 --> 00:27:45.398
first, why haven't I
heard more about this?

00:27:45.398 --> 00:27:48.922
And second, none of it will
matter on election day,

00:27:48.922 --> 00:27:50.891
it's not going to get through.

00:27:50.891 --> 00:27:54.113
The wind is blowing too hard and wild,

00:27:54.113 --> 00:27:57.282
she's an incrementalist
and an institutionalist

00:27:57.282 --> 00:27:59.032
in a hostile climate.

00:28:00.685 --> 00:28:05.454
In 1945 George Orwell
described nationalism as quote,

00:28:05.454 --> 00:28:08.420
"the habit of identifying
one's self with a single nation

00:28:08.420 --> 00:28:12.118
"or other unit, placing
it beyond good and evil,

00:28:12.118 --> 00:28:14.019
"and recognizing no other duty than that

00:28:14.019 --> 00:28:16.072
"of advancing its interests.

00:28:16.072 --> 00:28:19.769
"Nationalism is inseparable
from the desire for power.

00:28:19.769 --> 00:28:21.610
"The abiding purpose of every nationalist

00:28:21.610 --> 00:28:24.448
"is to secure more
power and more prestige,

00:28:24.448 --> 00:28:27.255
"not for himself, but for
the nation or other unit

00:28:27.255 --> 00:28:31.496
"in which he's chosen to sink
his individuality," unquote.

00:28:31.496 --> 00:28:35.269
Orwell called nationalism the
strongest force in the world;

00:28:35.269 --> 00:28:39.849
stronger than religion, or
socialism, or one-worldism,

00:28:39.849 --> 00:28:41.182
and it still is.

00:28:42.422 --> 00:28:46.505
Today American nationalism
has come to resemble

00:28:46.505 --> 00:28:49.383
the ethnonationalisms
on the rise in Europe

00:28:49.383 --> 00:28:51.692
and around the world.

00:28:51.692 --> 00:28:54.175
We still don't know the
extent and effectiveness

00:28:54.175 --> 00:28:56.228
of Russian meddling in the campaign,

00:28:56.228 --> 00:28:58.619
but one thing is already clear;

00:28:58.619 --> 00:29:02.249
the Russians knew us better
than we knew ourselves.

00:29:02.249 --> 00:29:05.833
They understood how divided
and cynical we'd become,

00:29:05.833 --> 00:29:08.270
what easy pray to fake news stories

00:29:08.270 --> 00:29:11.782
and ginned-up outrages,
what shallow playthings

00:29:11.782 --> 00:29:14.378
of Twitter and Facebook.

00:29:14.378 --> 00:29:17.343
The Russians understood
how the tech giants,

00:29:17.343 --> 00:29:19.743
lulled by their own success and narcissism

00:29:19.743 --> 00:29:22.973
into believing they were
unique forces for good,

00:29:22.973 --> 00:29:25.184
that an open and connected
world was the best

00:29:25.184 --> 00:29:28.036
of all possible worlds,
how easily these companies

00:29:28.036 --> 00:29:31.118
could be used against our democracy.

00:29:31.118 --> 00:29:33.963
The targeting was clever and precise.

00:29:33.963 --> 00:29:37.034
Russian saboteurs and their
online American collaborators

00:29:37.034 --> 00:29:39.419
knew exactly how to freak
out white Christians

00:29:39.419 --> 00:29:41.897
in the small towns outside Detroit

00:29:41.897 --> 00:29:46.064
by inventing a strident local
campaign against Islamophobia.

00:29:47.134 --> 00:29:49.918
By the way, the same thing
happened just last month

00:29:49.918 --> 00:29:52.559
in the Catalonian independence referendum.

00:29:52.559 --> 00:29:54.740
Some of the divisions
in Catalonia were fueled

00:29:54.740 --> 00:29:57.377
by Russian-inspired fake news.

00:29:57.377 --> 00:29:59.860
It turns out every society is fragile,

00:29:59.860 --> 00:30:02.886
every society can be torn apart

00:30:02.886 --> 00:30:06.312
by forces nihilistic enough to try.

00:30:06.312 --> 00:30:08.983
The Russians understood there
was nothing very exceptional

00:30:08.983 --> 00:30:11.118
about Americans after all.

00:30:11.118 --> 00:30:13.925
We were becoming more
and more like Europeans,

00:30:13.925 --> 00:30:16.197
and the weapons of information war

00:30:16.197 --> 00:30:17.525
that were already succeeding

00:30:17.525 --> 00:30:19.532
in Ukraine, and Hungary, and France

00:30:19.532 --> 00:30:23.509
could also be used in
Arizona and Wisconsin.

00:30:23.509 --> 00:30:26.490
The Russians somehow
intuited that our attachment

00:30:26.490 --> 00:30:29.823
to democracy had grown dangerously weak.

00:30:32.247 --> 00:30:33.997
Trump has driven some of this,

00:30:33.997 --> 00:30:37.265
but all the trends pre-dated him.

00:30:37.265 --> 00:30:41.430
According to Yascha Mounk,
Americans born in the 1980s

00:30:41.430 --> 00:30:43.988
are twice as likely to consider democracy

00:30:43.988 --> 00:30:48.659
a bad form of government
as those born in the 30s.

00:30:48.659 --> 00:30:51.942
Less than a third of Millennials
consider it essential

00:30:51.942 --> 00:30:55.711
to live in a democracy,
and all age groups today

00:30:55.711 --> 00:30:58.258
are more in favor of rule by a strongman

00:30:58.258 --> 00:31:00.591
than they were 20 years ago.

00:31:01.448 --> 00:31:04.580
And our attachment to
liberal values is weakening

00:31:04.580 --> 00:31:07.458
along with our belief in democracy.

00:31:07.458 --> 00:31:10.220
Other research shows that
many Americans are ready

00:31:10.220 --> 00:31:13.118
to get rid of various freedoms;

00:31:13.118 --> 00:31:15.400
three quarters don't think that fake news

00:31:15.400 --> 00:31:18.305
should be protected by
the First Amendment.

00:31:18.305 --> 00:31:20.486
Almost half of Republicans
think the government

00:31:20.486 --> 00:31:22.961
should be able to revoke
a broadcast license

00:31:22.961 --> 00:31:25.294
if it says a story is false.

00:31:26.297 --> 00:31:29.406
40% of Millennials believe
that the government

00:31:29.406 --> 00:31:33.488
should ban statements that are
offensive to minority groups.

00:31:33.488 --> 00:31:36.665
Half of Democrats think
government should pass a law

00:31:36.665 --> 00:31:39.449
requiring Americans to
use the preferred pronoun

00:31:39.449 --> 00:31:43.486
of transgender people, and
more than half of Republicans

00:31:43.486 --> 00:31:45.357
believe that burning the flag

00:31:45.357 --> 00:31:48.225
should cost you your citizenship.

00:31:48.225 --> 00:31:51.903
40% of all Americans don't
think that religious freedom

00:31:51.903 --> 00:31:53.948
should apply to all religious groups,

00:31:53.948 --> 00:31:57.698
it just depends on which
tribe you belong to.

00:31:58.830 --> 00:32:00.211
Now, I don't wanna sound sentimental,

00:32:00.211 --> 00:32:04.829
but all of this makes me sadder
than I can express to you.

00:32:04.829 --> 00:32:09.463
The essence of American
politics today is tribalism.

00:32:09.463 --> 00:32:12.990
By that I mean something
close to Orwell's nationalism;

00:32:12.990 --> 00:32:15.480
fierce attachment to one's group,

00:32:15.480 --> 00:32:17.589
a constant sense of embattlement,

00:32:17.589 --> 00:32:21.045
and us against them in
the struggle for power,

00:32:21.045 --> 00:32:24.787
a susceptibility to
confusing truth with lies,

00:32:24.787 --> 00:32:26.787
merging ends with means,

00:32:27.640 --> 00:32:30.364
a readiness to submerge
individual judgements

00:32:30.364 --> 00:32:33.714
and deviations to the
interests of the group,

00:32:33.714 --> 00:32:37.487
a contagion of mob thinking
that's greatly strengthened

00:32:37.487 --> 00:32:40.966
by social media, and
a longing for a leader

00:32:40.966 --> 00:32:43.630
who has simple answers for the aspirations

00:32:43.630 --> 00:32:45.720
and resentments of the group.

00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:47.403
So by tribalism what I really mean

00:32:47.403 --> 00:32:50.486
is the opposite of liberal democracy.

00:32:51.395 --> 00:32:54.564
Richard Rorty the philosopher
foresaw much of this

00:32:54.564 --> 00:32:58.427
back in the late 90s, in his
book Achieving Our Country,

00:32:58.427 --> 00:33:02.065
whose title comes from
a line by James Baldwin.

00:33:02.065 --> 00:33:04.570
Rorty described of the growing gap

00:33:04.570 --> 00:33:08.486
between the educated elite
and the old working class,

00:33:08.486 --> 00:33:09.986
and then he wrote,

00:33:11.369 --> 00:33:14.078
"At that point, something will crack.

00:33:14.078 --> 00:33:16.402
"The non-suburban electorate will decide

00:33:16.402 --> 00:33:18.907
"that the system has failed,
and start looking around

00:33:18.907 --> 00:33:22.605
"for a strongman to vote for,
someone willing to assure them

00:33:22.605 --> 00:33:25.468
"that once he's elected,
the smug bureaucrats,

00:33:25.468 --> 00:33:28.761
"tricky lawyers, overpaid bond salesmen,

00:33:28.761 --> 00:33:31.021
"and post-modernist
professors will no longer

00:33:31.021 --> 00:33:33.182
"be calling the shots.

00:33:33.182 --> 00:33:35.103
"One thing that's very likely to happen

00:33:35.103 --> 00:33:37.110
"is that the gains made
in the past 40 years

00:33:37.110 --> 00:33:39.826
"by black and brown
Americans, and by homosexuals,

00:33:39.826 --> 00:33:41.471
"will be wiped out.

00:33:41.471 --> 00:33:45.207
"Jocular contempt for women
will come back into fashion.

00:33:45.207 --> 00:33:48.044
"All the resentment which
badly educated Americans feel

00:33:48.044 --> 00:33:49.948
"about having their
manner dictated to them

00:33:49.948 --> 00:33:53.352
"by college graduates
will find an outlet."

00:33:53.352 --> 00:33:55.397
That was in the late 90s.

00:33:55.397 --> 00:33:59.133
After the election, this
passage enjoyed a brief fame

00:33:59.133 --> 00:34:02.143
for being posthumously prophetic.

00:34:02.143 --> 00:34:06.512
Now in the same slim volume,
Rorty also wrote this;

00:34:06.512 --> 00:34:09.833
"Nations rely on artists and intellectuals

00:34:09.833 --> 00:34:12.149
"to create images of, and to tell stories

00:34:12.149 --> 00:34:14.413
"about the national past.

00:34:14.413 --> 00:34:17.326
"Competition for political
leadership is in part

00:34:17.326 --> 00:34:19.809
"a competition between different stories

00:34:19.809 --> 00:34:22.053
"about a nation's self-identity,

00:34:22.053 --> 00:34:26.928
"and between differing
symbols of its greatness."

00:34:26.928 --> 00:34:29.909
So the stories we tell about the past

00:34:29.909 --> 00:34:32.452
create an idea of who we are as a nation.

00:34:32.452 --> 00:34:35.462
There's never been a single
idea of what that means,

00:34:35.462 --> 00:34:38.964
politics is a contest of narratives.

00:34:38.964 --> 00:34:42.265
The traditional old party
divide between the fair shake

00:34:42.265 --> 00:34:45.427
and getting ahead has broken up.

00:34:45.427 --> 00:34:49.818
Today, instead, I see
four dominant narratives.

00:34:49.818 --> 00:34:54.037
For one reason or other, none
of them gives us what we need,

00:34:54.037 --> 00:34:56.217
they all keep us in the hole we're in,

00:34:56.217 --> 00:35:01.002
they all turn away from the
heart of liberal democracy.

00:35:01.002 --> 00:35:03.386
The first narrative of American identity

00:35:03.386 --> 00:35:05.959
is Libertarian America.

00:35:05.959 --> 00:35:08.812
It imagines a nation of
individuals responsible

00:35:08.812 --> 00:35:13.649
for their own fates, its key
texts are The Federalist Papers

00:35:13.649 --> 00:35:16.871
and the works of Friedrich
Hayek and Milton Friedman.

00:35:16.871 --> 00:35:19.950
Its watchword is freedom, its ultimate aim

00:35:19.950 --> 00:35:23.281
is the nation without the state.

00:35:23.281 --> 00:35:25.503
This was the idea behind
the Reagan revolution,

00:35:25.503 --> 00:35:28.477
and in his words it had
the power of uplift,

00:35:28.477 --> 00:35:31.035
and transformed the political landscape,

00:35:31.035 --> 00:35:34.793
replacing what I call
the Roosevelt Republic

00:35:34.793 --> 00:35:37.275
with a vision of limitless opportunity,

00:35:37.275 --> 00:35:40.442
and creating a new political majority.

00:35:41.637 --> 00:35:45.282
Like all of the narratives I'm describing,

00:35:45.282 --> 00:35:48.929
Libertarian America has some
validity to its critique.

00:35:48.929 --> 00:35:50.740
In the 70s government seemed to fail

00:35:50.740 --> 00:35:53.094
at almost everything it tried.

00:35:53.094 --> 00:35:55.554
The growth of the regulatory state

00:35:55.554 --> 00:35:59.048
gave unelected bureaucrats
great power in people's lives

00:35:59.048 --> 00:36:01.108
in ways that could be stifling.

00:36:01.108 --> 00:36:03.025
It's a version of that Yascha Mounk calls

00:36:03.025 --> 00:36:05.025
Undemocratic Liberalism.

00:36:06.416 --> 00:36:09.608
In his Libertarian tract By the People,

00:36:09.608 --> 00:36:12.490
Charles Murray reports
that the number of pages

00:36:12.490 --> 00:36:15.207
in the code of federal regulations grew

00:36:15.207 --> 00:36:16.790
from 22,877 in 1960

00:36:19.707 --> 00:36:21.290
to 174,545 in 2012.

00:36:25.479 --> 00:36:27.721
That's the kind of thing a
progressive wouldn't even think

00:36:27.721 --> 00:36:29.048
to keep track of.

00:36:29.048 --> 00:36:30.293
(audience chuckling)

00:36:30.293 --> 00:36:33.719
In Murray's narrative everything
started to go off the rails

00:36:33.719 --> 00:36:37.500
in 1937, when the Supreme
Court, for the first time,

00:36:37.500 --> 00:36:39.254
upheld parts of the New Deal.

00:36:39.254 --> 00:36:40.997
According to Murray, just about everything

00:36:40.997 --> 00:36:42.959
the federal government has done since then

00:36:42.959 --> 00:36:45.162
is unconstitutional.

00:36:45.162 --> 00:36:49.041
His Golden Age was the
presidency of Grover Cleveland.

00:36:49.041 --> 00:36:51.629
(audience chuckling)

00:36:51.629 --> 00:36:53.911
In the past few decades,
Libertarian America

00:36:53.911 --> 00:36:57.012
turned into the ideology
of the Republican Party,

00:36:57.012 --> 00:36:59.902
a dogma of market fundamentalism

00:36:59.902 --> 00:37:03.253
that transferred wealth
and power to corporations,

00:37:03.253 --> 00:37:06.188
and to a tiny slice of
individuals at the top

00:37:06.188 --> 00:37:08.497
who are well organized and willing to pay

00:37:08.497 --> 00:37:11.206
for political influence.

00:37:11.206 --> 00:37:13.560
The Libertarian narrative
has little to say

00:37:13.560 --> 00:37:16.910
about economic inequality,
or the effects of technology

00:37:16.910 --> 00:37:19.114
and globalization on ordinary people

00:37:19.114 --> 00:37:21.415
who don't benefit from them.

00:37:21.415 --> 00:37:25.934
In its extreme form, it's
adopted a destructive attitude

00:37:25.934 --> 00:37:27.991
toward the normal functions of government,

00:37:27.991 --> 00:37:31.530
a willingness to see the
whole structure collapse

00:37:31.530 --> 00:37:34.246
on the single-minded
path to gaining power,

00:37:34.246 --> 00:37:37.174
which has become an end in itself.

00:37:37.174 --> 00:37:39.476
This extremism has found its way

00:37:39.476 --> 00:37:43.041
into the center of power in Washington.

00:37:43.041 --> 00:37:44.475
In American history, beginning with

00:37:44.475 --> 00:37:47.953
the founding of the Republic,
the settling of the West,

00:37:47.953 --> 00:37:50.927
the end of slavery, the
taming of industrialism,

00:37:50.927 --> 00:37:52.809
the struggle against economic collapse,

00:37:52.809 --> 00:37:54.684
Fascism, and Communism,

00:37:54.684 --> 00:37:57.057
the National Transportation System,

00:37:57.057 --> 00:38:00.478
the fight for equal
rights, the space program,

00:38:00.478 --> 00:38:02.689
environmentalism, even
the digital revolution,

00:38:02.689 --> 00:38:06.424
all of these national projects
depended on the existence

00:38:06.424 --> 00:38:09.638
of a strong central
government, visionary leaders,

00:38:09.638 --> 00:38:11.245
active citizens.

00:38:11.245 --> 00:38:14.981
But the Libertarian idea
regards Americans as consumers,

00:38:14.981 --> 00:38:19.148
entrepreneurs, tax payers,
everything except citizens.

00:38:20.097 --> 00:38:22.655
It has no vision of
self-government as the answer

00:38:22.655 --> 00:38:25.092
to people's actual needs.

00:38:25.092 --> 00:38:27.435
This is why Paul Ryan is
willing to let Donald Trump

00:38:27.435 --> 00:38:29.910
trash our democracy for
the sake of tax cuts

00:38:29.910 --> 00:38:31.493
for rich investors.

00:38:32.649 --> 00:38:34.445
Since the election, Libertarian America

00:38:34.445 --> 00:38:36.815
remains politically alive,

00:38:36.815 --> 00:38:39.478
as a class of Republican
politicians, and donors,

00:38:39.478 --> 00:38:43.312
and think tankers, who continue
to function in Washington

00:38:43.312 --> 00:38:46.353
with no real connection to
the party's voting base,

00:38:46.353 --> 00:38:48.603
it's a head without a body.

00:38:49.756 --> 00:38:51.582
The second narrative I wanna talk about

00:38:51.582 --> 00:38:54.343
is Cosmopolitan America.

00:38:54.343 --> 00:38:56.554
This is Silicon Valley's America,

00:38:56.554 --> 00:38:58.630
in which you have to be a lifelong learner

00:38:58.630 --> 00:39:01.467
and work for the startup of you,

00:39:01.467 --> 00:39:04.085
and the transnational
flow of goods and capital,

00:39:04.085 --> 00:39:07.051
information, and people benefits everyone.

00:39:07.051 --> 00:39:08.455
I imagine many people in this room

00:39:08.455 --> 00:39:11.586
are citizens of Cosmopolitan America.

00:39:11.586 --> 00:39:14.748
It's the home without a home
of educated professionals,

00:39:14.748 --> 00:39:17.698
who, more than any other
group, are at ease in the world

00:39:17.698 --> 00:39:19.819
that modernity has made.

00:39:19.819 --> 00:39:22.701
For many of us, in the last decade or two,

00:39:22.701 --> 00:39:25.277
the surface of life has
gotten a lot more pleasant

00:39:25.277 --> 00:39:29.481
and interesting; think
of HBO, Lipitor, FedEx,

00:39:29.481 --> 00:39:32.537
eTrade, Mileage Plus Platinum,

00:39:32.537 --> 00:39:33.819
(audience laughing)

00:39:33.819 --> 00:39:37.811
organic grass-fed beef,
cold brewed coffee,

00:39:37.811 --> 00:39:39.228
and Amazon Prime.

00:39:40.830 --> 00:39:43.901
Cosmopolitan America comes
with a breezy ideology

00:39:43.901 --> 00:39:47.749
of flattening hierarchies,
disrupting systems,

00:39:47.749 --> 00:39:50.767
discarding old elites, you
find this strain of thought

00:39:50.767 --> 00:39:53.646
in all the important
sectors; politics, business,

00:39:53.646 --> 00:39:56.030
finance, tech, even culture.

00:39:56.030 --> 00:39:58.060
Think of the writer and
the reader in the age

00:39:58.060 --> 00:40:01.719
of Amazon's self-publishing
platform with Jeff Bezos

00:40:01.719 --> 00:40:04.496
promising the end of all gatekeepers.

00:40:04.496 --> 00:40:06.024
Think of the professional reporter

00:40:06.024 --> 00:40:09.933
in the age of the citizen
journalist on Twitter and Reddit,

00:40:09.933 --> 00:40:13.336
but across sectors, the
result is always the same;

00:40:13.336 --> 00:40:16.498
when you tear down old
structures, wealth and power

00:40:16.498 --> 00:40:20.444
become concentrated in
the hands of fewer people.

00:40:20.444 --> 00:40:22.301
In a way, Cosmopolitan America

00:40:22.301 --> 00:40:27.190
is the progressive counterpart
to Libertarian America.

00:40:27.190 --> 00:40:29.334
Cosmopolitan Americans are right to say

00:40:29.334 --> 00:40:32.126
that those old jobs aren't coming back,

00:40:32.126 --> 00:40:35.053
that a college degree
is the key to success,

00:40:35.053 --> 00:40:36.925
that it's better to be open and tolerant

00:40:36.925 --> 00:40:39.762
than narrow and parochial.

00:40:39.762 --> 00:40:42.735
But in its optimism about
technology and the future,

00:40:42.735 --> 00:40:45.452
it has missed something important.

00:40:45.452 --> 00:40:48.863
In 2004 the political
scientist Samuel Huntington

00:40:48.863 --> 00:40:52.002
published his last book, Who Are We?;

00:40:52.002 --> 00:40:55.254
The Challenges to America's
National Identity.

00:40:55.254 --> 00:40:57.940
It was a very troubling
book, because it presented

00:40:57.940 --> 00:41:00.619
American democracy as
a product of European,

00:41:00.619 --> 00:41:04.581
specifically Anglo-Protestant culture.

00:41:04.581 --> 00:41:08.045
Like warnings 100 years ago
about Southern and Eastern

00:41:08.045 --> 00:41:11.282
European immigration, it
argued that certain immigrants,

00:41:11.282 --> 00:41:15.198
especially Latin American
Catholics, are not natural fits

00:41:15.198 --> 00:41:17.168
for America's identity.

00:41:17.168 --> 00:41:20.807
The argument had an
undeniable streak of racism.

00:41:20.807 --> 00:41:23.335
Huntington expressed
anxiety about the weakening

00:41:23.335 --> 00:41:25.810
of national bonds in contemporary America,

00:41:25.810 --> 00:41:29.243
he wanted a country of patriots
who shared the same culture

00:41:29.243 --> 00:41:32.624
and loved their country, and
were willing to fight for it.

00:41:32.624 --> 00:41:35.959
In my own magazine,
Huntington was roundly mocked

00:41:35.959 --> 00:41:38.706
by our reviewer, who wrote,

00:41:38.706 --> 00:41:41.732
"If the world is becoming more
porous, more transnational,

00:41:41.732 --> 00:41:44.471
"more attuned to the
same economic, social,

00:41:44.471 --> 00:41:47.950
"and informational frequency,
if the globe is more global,

00:41:47.950 --> 00:41:49.924
"which means more
Americanized, then the need

00:41:49.924 --> 00:41:53.259
"for national cultural homogeneity
is lesser, not greater.

00:41:53.259 --> 00:41:57.426
"The stronger societies will
be the more cosmopolitan ones."

00:41:58.903 --> 00:42:01.635
A decade later how do things look?

00:42:01.635 --> 00:42:03.800
Whatever you think of
Huntington, he had a clearer view

00:42:03.800 --> 00:42:08.071
of the forces shaping the
near future than his critic.

00:42:08.071 --> 00:42:10.486
The passage is like a
time capsule from a period

00:42:10.486 --> 00:42:12.459
when progressives thought
that globalization

00:42:12.459 --> 00:42:15.792
was making national identities obsolete.

00:42:16.745 --> 00:42:18.971
The blind spot of cosmopolitan Americans

00:42:18.971 --> 00:42:20.503
is that they always underestimate

00:42:20.503 --> 00:42:23.035
ordinary people's
attachment to their country,

00:42:23.035 --> 00:42:25.495
because they've lost it in themselves.

00:42:25.495 --> 00:42:28.566
As a result, they often fail
to foresee the direction

00:42:28.566 --> 00:42:30.816
politics is likely to take.

00:42:31.856 --> 00:42:35.221
Nationalism can be turned to
positive or negative uses,

00:42:35.221 --> 00:42:38.602
but it's a force that never
completely disappears;

00:42:38.602 --> 00:42:42.896
in the last few years we
should've at least learned that.

00:42:42.896 --> 00:42:47.431
The third narrative of national
identity is Diverse America.

00:42:47.431 --> 00:42:49.830
It sees Americans as members of groups,

00:42:49.830 --> 00:42:52.419
whose status is determined
by the story of oppression,

00:42:52.419 --> 00:42:54.565
past and present.

00:42:54.565 --> 00:42:56.703
During the later Obama years,

00:42:56.703 --> 00:43:00.420
it came as a necessary
corrective to the naive illusion

00:43:00.420 --> 00:43:03.001
that equal rights for
all was a settled matter

00:43:03.001 --> 00:43:04.699
in this country.

00:43:04.699 --> 00:43:08.374
As a struggle to give all
Americans a place at the table,

00:43:08.374 --> 00:43:11.649
based on human rights
and universal values,

00:43:11.649 --> 00:43:13.097
the narrative of Diverse America

00:43:13.097 --> 00:43:15.859
is a force for immense good,

00:43:15.859 --> 00:43:18.727
but in our moment it's becoming a dogma

00:43:18.727 --> 00:43:21.975
among cultural elites,
one that dominates media,

00:43:21.975 --> 00:43:25.058
schools and universities,
foundations, and the arts,

00:43:25.058 --> 00:43:27.472
it's become an end in itself.

00:43:27.472 --> 00:43:30.340
But even the just cause
of inclusion is a dead end

00:43:30.340 --> 00:43:34.022
if we can't answer, included in what?

00:43:34.022 --> 00:43:35.735
What is the vision of national identity

00:43:35.735 --> 00:43:38.950
that is the sum of all these parts?

00:43:38.950 --> 00:43:41.817
The narrative of Diverse
America is fostered in schools

00:43:41.817 --> 00:43:42.942
from a young age.

00:43:42.942 --> 00:43:45.945
I see it in my son's public
elementary school education

00:43:45.945 --> 00:43:47.681
in New York, where he's learning

00:43:47.681 --> 00:43:51.356
about all sorts of cultures,
from African and Chinese,

00:43:51.356 --> 00:43:53.695
to Mayan and Native American,
but hasn't been taught

00:43:53.695 --> 00:43:57.128
the origin story of his
own American republic.

00:43:57.128 --> 00:44:01.165
He knows something about it
from listening to Hamilton,

00:44:01.165 --> 00:44:02.926
and my kids are obsessed with Hamilton,

00:44:02.926 --> 00:44:04.364
they could tell you all about the fight

00:44:04.364 --> 00:44:07.579
over the establishment of a national bank.

00:44:07.579 --> 00:44:10.876
Hamilton's greatness is not
just its music and language,

00:44:10.876 --> 00:44:13.623
but its vision of inclusion that affirms

00:44:13.623 --> 00:44:16.086
a common American identity
of its characters,

00:44:16.086 --> 00:44:18.931
its performers, and its audiences.

00:44:18.931 --> 00:44:22.153
But Hamilton is not a
replacement for civics class,

00:44:22.153 --> 00:44:24.070
which no longer exists.

00:44:24.990 --> 00:44:27.563
Diverse America has replaced
it with an education

00:44:27.563 --> 00:44:30.951
that celebrates difference
without teaching

00:44:30.951 --> 00:44:33.279
the concepts and the
history, good and bad,

00:44:33.279 --> 00:44:35.015
achievement and failure, that underlie

00:44:35.015 --> 00:44:37.415
the struggle for equality.

00:44:37.415 --> 00:44:39.312
King demanded that America

00:44:39.312 --> 00:44:42.175
live out the true meaning of its creed.

00:44:42.175 --> 00:44:44.073
The most powerful voices today claim

00:44:44.073 --> 00:44:46.677
that the creed itself is foul,

00:44:46.677 --> 00:44:49.426
the very notion of American
identity is taken to be

00:44:49.426 --> 00:44:51.176
a coercive whitewash.

00:44:52.373 --> 00:44:54.916
The narrative of Diverse
America gets codified

00:44:54.916 --> 00:44:58.395
in universities, particularly elite ones,

00:44:58.395 --> 00:44:59.844
where students receive their first

00:44:59.844 --> 00:45:02.835
and most decisive instruction
from diversity officers;

00:45:02.835 --> 00:45:06.933
on many campuses this is the
true and only core curriculum.

00:45:06.933 --> 00:45:08.902
I understand the value,

00:45:08.902 --> 00:45:11.642
but I also understand the side effects.

00:45:11.642 --> 00:45:14.607
It can become a weapon against
the open exchange of ideas,

00:45:14.607 --> 00:45:18.320
and even speech, which
Brown University now defines

00:45:18.320 --> 00:45:22.463
as speech that makes all
groups feel included.

00:45:22.463 --> 00:45:24.598
The focus lately has
been on controversial,

00:45:24.598 --> 00:45:27.873
sometimes hateful speech, efforts
on campus to shut it down,

00:45:27.873 --> 00:45:30.416
you know this better than I do.

00:45:30.416 --> 00:45:32.740
But I'm actually less
concerned by the tired ritual

00:45:32.740 --> 00:45:35.087
of attention-seeking charlatans

00:45:35.087 --> 00:45:36.958
and the crowds that confront them

00:45:36.958 --> 00:45:40.233
than I am by the subtle
daily intellectual chill

00:45:40.233 --> 00:45:41.652
in college classrooms,

00:45:41.652 --> 00:45:44.067
the fear that keeps students of good will

00:45:44.067 --> 00:45:45.674
from participating in discussions

00:45:45.674 --> 00:45:47.455
that could land them on social media

00:45:47.455 --> 00:45:49.824
or in the campus paper.

00:45:49.824 --> 00:45:52.111
This chill is real enough
that my professor friends

00:45:52.111 --> 00:45:53.997
will talk about it only if I assure them

00:45:53.997 --> 00:45:56.344
that they're off the record.

00:45:56.344 --> 00:45:58.789
And it's all unfair the students;

00:45:58.789 --> 00:46:01.875
the products of the
educations are less able,

00:46:01.875 --> 00:46:03.694
or less willing, to think in terms

00:46:03.694 --> 00:46:05.783
larger than their own group.

00:46:05.783 --> 00:46:07.466
It's a kind of intellectual narcissism,

00:46:07.466 --> 00:46:10.208
which means they can't find common ground

00:46:10.208 --> 00:46:12.607
or effective arguments
that can reach people

00:46:12.607 --> 00:46:14.853
of different backgrounds and views,

00:46:14.853 --> 00:46:17.557
instead they're taught to
explore and affirm the contours

00:46:17.557 --> 00:46:19.971
of their own group.

00:46:19.971 --> 00:46:23.616
Here's a recent story
from Diverse America.

00:46:23.616 --> 00:46:26.189
Kirkus is a famously
stingy old book review

00:46:26.189 --> 00:46:27.842
with a lot of influence.

00:46:27.842 --> 00:46:30.709
Like Publisher's Weekly, it
reviews books anonymously

00:46:30.709 --> 00:46:32.347
before they're published.

00:46:32.347 --> 00:46:36.142
A month ago Kirkus reviewed
a new young adult novel

00:46:36.142 --> 00:46:39.161
called American Heart, a dystopia

00:46:39.161 --> 00:46:42.843
about a near future America
with Muslim registries

00:46:42.843 --> 00:46:45.115
and internment camps.

00:46:45.115 --> 00:46:47.906
The narrator, a white
teenage girl in the Midwest,

00:46:47.906 --> 00:46:50.785
slowly discovers the
horror of this system,

00:46:50.785 --> 00:46:55.086
and helps an Iranian immigrant
woman flee to Canada.

00:46:55.086 --> 00:46:58.301
The author submitted her
novel to Muslim friends

00:46:58.301 --> 00:47:00.995
from multiple sensitivity reads,

00:47:00.995 --> 00:47:04.238
and then Kirkus added another
level of sensitivity screening

00:47:04.238 --> 00:47:07.937
with a new rule of assigning its reviews.

00:47:07.937 --> 00:47:11.370
Quote, "Because there's no
substitute for lived experience,

00:47:11.370 --> 00:47:14.003
"as much as possible, books
with diverse subject matter

00:47:14.003 --> 00:47:16.011
"and protagonists are assigned to quote,

00:47:16.011 --> 00:47:19.972
"'un-own' voices reviewers,
to identify both those books

00:47:19.972 --> 00:47:22.062
"that resonate most with cultural insiders

00:47:22.062 --> 00:47:25.720
"and those books that
fall short," unquote.

00:47:25.720 --> 00:47:28.248
By this rule, cultural
outsider Saul Bellow

00:47:28.248 --> 00:47:30.852
would be prohibited from
raving about diverse novelist

00:47:30.852 --> 00:47:33.440
Ralph Ellison's Invisible Man.

00:47:33.440 --> 00:47:37.371
Cultural outsider Zadie Smith
would have to be called out

00:47:37.371 --> 00:47:39.159
for writing on beauty as an homage

00:47:39.159 --> 00:47:41.909
to cultural insider E.M. Forster.

00:47:42.754 --> 00:47:45.935
But in keeping with its rule,
Kirkus assigned American Heart

00:47:45.935 --> 00:47:49.074
to an observant Muslim woman of color.

00:47:49.074 --> 00:47:50.730
But somehow these layers of screening

00:47:50.730 --> 00:47:52.526
did not prevent a political mistake

00:47:52.526 --> 00:47:54.616
from slipping into the final product,

00:47:54.616 --> 00:47:57.076
because the reviewer loved American Heart,

00:47:57.076 --> 00:48:00.042
and she gave it a rare starred review.

00:48:00.042 --> 00:48:03.249
Almost immediately, one of
the many mobs on social media,

00:48:03.249 --> 00:48:07.386
the subgroup of hyper-vigilant
young adult fiction police,

00:48:07.386 --> 00:48:11.081
yes, it exists, denounced
the book and the review

00:48:11.081 --> 00:48:12.847
for failing to see that a white writer

00:48:12.847 --> 00:48:16.008
had no business portraying
a non-white Muslim character

00:48:16.008 --> 00:48:18.773
through the eyes of a white protagonist;

00:48:18.773 --> 00:48:21.724
it was the Huckleberry Finn mistake.

00:48:21.724 --> 00:48:24.916
Kirkus caved in and
withdrew its starred review,

00:48:24.916 --> 00:48:28.206
and compelled the reviewer
to reconsider her praise.

00:48:28.206 --> 00:48:31.190
The Editor in Chief, Claiborne Smith,

00:48:31.190 --> 00:48:33.982
posted a statement in place
of the withdrawn review.

00:48:33.982 --> 00:48:37.207
Quote, "We've removed the
starred review from kirkus.com

00:48:37.207 --> 00:48:38.981
"after determining that while we believe

00:48:38.981 --> 00:48:41.335
"our reviewer's opinion
is worthy and valid,

00:48:41.335 --> 00:48:43.380
"some of the wording fell
short of meeting our standards

00:48:43.380 --> 00:48:45.489
"for clarity and sensitivity,

00:48:45.489 --> 00:48:47.069
"and we failed to make
the thoughtful edits

00:48:47.069 --> 00:48:48.122
"our readers deserve.

00:48:48.122 --> 00:48:50.303
"The editors are evaluating the review

00:48:50.303 --> 00:48:52.280
"and will make a
determination about correction

00:48:52.280 --> 00:48:54.513
"or retraction after careful consideration

00:48:54.513 --> 00:48:57.660
"in collaboration with
the reviewer," unquote.

00:48:57.660 --> 00:48:59.625
Those sentences would be right at home

00:48:59.625 --> 00:49:01.485
in a communique from the Central Committee

00:49:01.485 --> 00:49:04.967
announcing the purge of
Comrade X from the politburo.

00:49:04.967 --> 00:49:08.098
This is language that's trying
not to say what it means;

00:49:08.098 --> 00:49:11.547
it has something to hide,
and it seems driven by fear,

00:49:11.547 --> 00:49:13.546
and like most frightened
thought, it ends up

00:49:13.546 --> 00:49:15.787
in the arms of an absurdity.

00:49:15.787 --> 00:49:19.394
By Kirkus' own standard,
the privileged white male,

00:49:19.394 --> 00:49:21.937
Claiborne Smith, who
runs the organization,

00:49:21.937 --> 00:49:24.072
is the cultural outsider,

00:49:24.072 --> 00:49:26.578
yet he forced the Muslim woman of color

00:49:26.578 --> 00:49:28.623
to correct her mistake.

00:49:28.623 --> 00:49:32.283
When the review was reposted,
it no longer had a star,

00:49:32.283 --> 00:49:34.478
and it include a new sentence;

00:49:34.478 --> 00:49:36.697
"it is problematic that Siddath is seen

00:49:36.697 --> 00:49:39.530
"only through the white
protagonist filter."

00:49:39.530 --> 00:49:41.462
Apparently this language
brought the review up

00:49:41.462 --> 00:49:45.559
to Kirkus' standards for
clarity and sensitivity.

00:49:45.559 --> 00:49:48.351
I've told this story at
length because it contains

00:49:48.351 --> 00:49:51.388
so much that we've come
to accept as normal;

00:49:51.388 --> 00:49:53.962
a soft cultural separatism,

00:49:53.962 --> 00:49:58.233
tyranny of the majority on
Twitter, self-censorship,

00:49:58.233 --> 00:50:01.832
and an attitude toward
diversity that ends up embracing

00:50:01.832 --> 00:50:05.296
the essentialism that it
started out rejecting.

00:50:05.296 --> 00:50:06.782
I realize that this makes me sound

00:50:06.782 --> 00:50:08.850
a little like a conservative.

00:50:08.850 --> 00:50:12.017
In my own mind, it makes me a liberal.

00:50:13.045 --> 00:50:15.151
Diverse America is reacting to Trump,

00:50:15.151 --> 00:50:17.784
and he's making it more extreme.

00:50:17.784 --> 00:50:20.448
He shrewdly sees it as his ally.

00:50:20.448 --> 00:50:22.802
It sounds more and more
like the progressive echo

00:50:22.802 --> 00:50:24.219
of America First.

00:50:25.594 --> 00:50:28.371
This brings me to the fourth
narrative of national identity,

00:50:28.371 --> 00:50:31.518
the one that prevailed
in last year's election.

00:50:31.518 --> 00:50:34.514
America First is the most
superficially nationalistic

00:50:34.514 --> 00:50:39.117
of the four, but its
nationalism is shallow, static,

00:50:39.117 --> 00:50:41.765
pessimistic, and brittle.

00:50:41.765 --> 00:50:43.833
It's convinced that the country has lost

00:50:43.833 --> 00:50:45.104
its traditional identity

00:50:45.104 --> 00:50:47.881
because of contamination and weakness.

00:50:47.881 --> 00:50:51.466
The contamination of
others, foreigners, Muslims,

00:50:51.466 --> 00:50:55.005
the weakness of elites who have
no allegiance to the country

00:50:55.005 --> 00:50:57.963
because they've been
globalized; they eat sushi

00:50:57.963 --> 00:51:02.203
and attend conferences in Dubai,
and vacation in Australia.

00:51:02.203 --> 00:51:05.509
The elites have betrayed
the true patriots.

00:51:05.509 --> 00:51:08.301
This nationalism isn't based on the ideas

00:51:08.301 --> 00:51:10.859
in the Declaration of
Independence, the Bill of Rights,

00:51:10.859 --> 00:51:12.625
and the Emancipation Proclamation,

00:51:12.625 --> 00:51:16.405
but in the blood and
soil of the heartland.

00:51:16.405 --> 00:51:18.420
That's where the real America is found,

00:51:18.420 --> 00:51:22.101
among the common people; the
white, Christian inhabitants

00:51:22.101 --> 00:51:24.750
of the towns and farms.

00:51:24.750 --> 00:51:28.154
Now, one thing to notice about
the idea of America First

00:51:28.154 --> 00:51:30.457
is it sounds kind of foreign,

00:51:30.457 --> 00:51:32.985
it actually sounds European.

00:51:32.985 --> 00:51:35.340
In July Trump gave a speech

00:51:35.340 --> 00:51:38.162
before a rapturous crowd in Warsaw,

00:51:38.162 --> 00:51:40.916
in which he named the enemies
of Western civilization,

00:51:40.916 --> 00:51:42.742
they are radical Islamic terrorists

00:51:42.742 --> 00:51:45.670
and government bureaucrats.

00:51:45.670 --> 00:51:49.837
Trump declared, "Americans,
Pols, and the nations of Europe

00:51:50.771 --> 00:51:52.922
"value individual freedom and sovereignty.

00:51:52.922 --> 00:51:55.397
"We must work together to confront forces

00:51:55.397 --> 00:51:57.910
"whether they come from inside or out,

00:51:57.910 --> 00:52:01.060
"from the south or the east,
that threaten over time

00:52:01.060 --> 00:52:04.033
"to undermine these values,
and to erase the bonds

00:52:04.033 --> 00:52:08.078
"of culture, faith, and tradition
that make us who we are."

00:52:08.078 --> 00:52:11.722
He led the Polish crowd
in a chant of we want God,

00:52:11.722 --> 00:52:14.311
which meant the Christian God.

00:52:14.311 --> 00:52:16.182
I picture Trump in a white uniform

00:52:16.182 --> 00:52:19.154
with a red sash and gold braiding.

00:52:19.154 --> 00:52:22.289
He sounds more like a fascist wannabe

00:52:22.289 --> 00:52:23.998
than like James Madison.

00:52:23.998 --> 00:52:27.084
Culture, faith, and tradition,

00:52:27.084 --> 00:52:30.001
not self-government, not democracy.

00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:34.102
His rhetoric isn't even in the
conservative American grain,

00:52:34.102 --> 00:52:36.992
it's reactionary; this is the meaning

00:52:36.992 --> 00:52:39.543
of Make America Great Again.

00:52:39.543 --> 00:52:42.682
Though the phrase invokes
nostalgia for an imagined past,

00:52:42.682 --> 00:52:45.783
it has nothing to do with
the past, it's a radical call

00:52:45.783 --> 00:52:48.839
to sweep away the established order.

00:52:48.839 --> 00:52:51.722
It even has something in
common with its arch enemy,

00:52:51.722 --> 00:52:54.461
political Islamism, which is also obsessed

00:52:54.461 --> 00:52:57.321
with conspiracies, treacherous elites,

00:52:57.321 --> 00:53:01.464
purification, and an imaginary Golden Age.

00:53:01.464 --> 00:53:04.316
It's built on the myth of
the people, the true folk,

00:53:04.316 --> 00:53:08.878
or better yet, the volk, who
do the work and fight the wars,

00:53:08.878 --> 00:53:11.304
and are betrayed and forgotten
by the decadent rulers

00:53:11.304 --> 00:53:13.952
in the imperial center.

00:53:13.952 --> 00:53:16.775
This narrative comes with
an autocratic character,

00:53:16.775 --> 00:53:20.215
and contempt for liberal
values and democratic norms,

00:53:20.215 --> 00:53:24.600
it personalizes power,
it routinizes corruption,

00:53:24.600 --> 00:53:28.373
it destabilizes the very idea of truth,

00:53:28.373 --> 00:53:31.104
it's the greatest threat
to American democracy

00:53:31.104 --> 00:53:32.437
in our lifetime.

00:53:34.372 --> 00:53:37.209
I realize there are other
ways to discuss the question

00:53:37.209 --> 00:53:41.042
of American identity today,
but these are the narratives

00:53:41.042 --> 00:53:43.774
that strike me as the strongest.

00:53:43.774 --> 00:53:46.083
Most Americans, without
thinking about it much,

00:53:46.083 --> 00:53:48.732
subscribe to one or another.

00:53:48.732 --> 00:53:51.418
One thing to notice is
that all of them create

00:53:51.418 --> 00:53:53.539
winners and losers.

00:53:53.539 --> 00:53:56.708
In Libertarian America the
winners are the makers,

00:53:56.708 --> 00:54:01.605
and the losers are the
takers, Mitt Romney's 47%.

00:54:01.605 --> 00:54:05.273
In Cosmopolitan America the
winners are the meritocrats,

00:54:05.273 --> 00:54:09.440
and the losers are the poorly
educated so loved by Trump.

00:54:10.313 --> 00:54:13.619
In Diverse America groups
fight for their claims

00:54:13.619 --> 00:54:15.362
against the claims of others,

00:54:15.362 --> 00:54:19.308
including the soon-to-be-minority
majority group.

00:54:19.308 --> 00:54:21.583
And in America First it's the true people

00:54:21.583 --> 00:54:24.612
against the elites and aliens.

00:54:24.612 --> 00:54:28.378
Each narrative pits tribe against tribe,

00:54:28.378 --> 00:54:31.940
each tribe imagines that
the others are illegitimate,

00:54:31.940 --> 00:54:36.663
and will somehow disappear by
being defeated at the polls,

00:54:36.663 --> 00:54:40.044
or overtaken by demography, or walled off,

00:54:40.044 --> 00:54:41.794
or just by dying off.

00:54:42.730 --> 00:54:45.568
None of them has much
conviction in the values

00:54:45.568 --> 00:54:49.435
and institutions of American democracy.

00:54:49.435 --> 00:54:51.321
It's always fallen short of the ideal,

00:54:51.321 --> 00:54:54.154
what's new is a sense
that the ideal itself

00:54:54.154 --> 00:54:56.654
might not be worth the effort.

00:54:57.626 --> 00:55:00.093
I would like to leave you
with another narrative,

00:55:00.093 --> 00:55:03.489
but I don't have one, not yet anyway.

00:55:03.489 --> 00:55:05.247
If you do, please let me know.

00:55:05.247 --> 00:55:06.575
(audience chuckling)

00:55:06.575 --> 00:55:10.846
What I have is a bunch of
worries and an aspiration.

00:55:10.846 --> 00:55:13.842
By now you know about the worries,

00:55:13.842 --> 00:55:17.954
so here's the aspiration; let's recognize

00:55:17.954 --> 00:55:21.905
that you can't avoid the
struggle to define our identity.

00:55:21.905 --> 00:55:23.663
If you do you'll abandon the field

00:55:23.663 --> 00:55:26.010
to the ugliest version available,

00:55:26.010 --> 00:55:28.794
because people still feel
attached to their country

00:55:28.794 --> 00:55:31.382
just as they do to their family.

00:55:31.382 --> 00:55:34.740
So instead of wishing
national identity away,

00:55:34.740 --> 00:55:38.664
we should define it in the
most inclusive terms possible,

00:55:38.664 --> 00:55:42.626
terms that get as far away
as we can from tribalism.

00:55:42.626 --> 00:55:46.793
The most inclusive category
I know is that of citizen,

00:55:47.712 --> 00:55:50.345
but it can be a hollow
category for Americans

00:55:50.345 --> 00:55:53.364
who are shut out because of who they are,

00:55:53.364 --> 00:55:56.344
or where they live, or how much they make.

00:55:56.344 --> 00:55:58.948
The first step is to
remove those barriers,

00:55:58.948 --> 00:56:01.115
and then again, and again.

00:56:02.140 --> 00:56:06.307
A second is to restore civics
to our children's education.

00:56:07.241 --> 00:56:09.474
I don't just mean how a bill becomes a law

00:56:09.474 --> 00:56:11.904
and what's in the Constitution,
although it would be nice

00:56:11.904 --> 00:56:14.236
if more than a quarter of
Americans could identify

00:56:14.236 --> 00:56:16.812
the three branches of government,

00:56:16.812 --> 00:56:19.159
and if more than half could
name at least one of the rights

00:56:19.159 --> 00:56:21.265
in the First Amendment.

00:56:21.265 --> 00:56:23.514
I mean we should teach our children

00:56:23.514 --> 00:56:26.192
that democracy requires citizens.

00:56:26.192 --> 00:56:28.735
By all means let's teach them the critique

00:56:28.735 --> 00:56:32.886
of American democracy, but
let's also teach them the ideal

00:56:32.886 --> 00:56:35.274
so that they know what
it is we're critiquing,

00:56:35.274 --> 00:56:40.111
and in what way we've fallen
short, and why that matters.

00:56:40.111 --> 00:56:43.823
Being citizens sounds
namby-pamby; it isn't,

00:56:43.823 --> 00:56:48.004
it's hard work, and it
often feels like failure.

00:56:48.004 --> 00:56:51.218
I am not saying to tone
it down, be more polite,

00:56:51.218 --> 00:56:53.671
pretend we can all agree, for in fact

00:56:53.671 --> 00:56:55.414
there are fundamental values at stake

00:56:55.414 --> 00:56:58.176
that Americans will never agree on.

00:56:58.176 --> 00:57:00.960
I'm saying that we
should be more militant,

00:57:00.960 --> 00:57:05.329
not for my tribe or yours,
but for our democracy itself.

00:57:05.329 --> 00:57:06.325
Thank you.

00:57:06.325 --> 00:57:09.492
(audience applauding)

00:57:12.272 --> 00:57:13.274
- [Audience Member] Thank you Mr. Packer,

00:57:13.274 --> 00:57:15.796
I think I speak for the crowd
when I say that was brilliant,

00:57:15.796 --> 00:57:17.771
so thank you.
- Thank you, thank you.

00:57:17.771 --> 00:57:20.125
- You alluded to this a bit in your talk,

00:57:20.125 --> 00:57:22.517
but over the course of this summer,

00:57:22.517 --> 00:57:25.466
Ta-Nehisi Coates took a shot
at you fairly or unfairly,

00:57:25.466 --> 00:57:27.500
in a pretty remarkable piece.

00:57:27.500 --> 00:57:28.602
So I'd just like you to speak,

00:57:28.602 --> 00:57:32.010
since your theme was largely
on alienation, tribalism,

00:57:32.010 --> 00:57:33.295
how has your thinking shifted,

00:57:33.295 --> 00:57:36.520
since you wrote The Unwinding, on race?

00:57:36.520 --> 00:57:40.110
- That's a great question,
because although The Unwinding

00:57:40.110 --> 00:57:42.068
has one of its three main characters,

00:57:42.068 --> 00:57:45.326
a black woman in Youngstown,
it really isn't very much

00:57:45.326 --> 00:57:48.183
about race, and she didn't
talk very much about race,

00:57:48.183 --> 00:57:51.538
she talked about jobs,
and about her community,

00:57:51.538 --> 00:57:53.047
and about what had happened to Youngstown

00:57:53.047 --> 00:57:57.009
when the steel mills left, and
her own job went to Mexico,

00:57:57.009 --> 00:57:58.805
and it was more about class.

00:57:58.805 --> 00:58:02.972
And in a way, I wrote that
book between 2009 and 2012,

00:58:04.910 --> 00:58:08.243
when class was, for me the overwhelming,

00:58:10.758 --> 00:58:13.444
class and inequality,
and the fate of Americans

00:58:13.444 --> 00:58:16.666
who were being crushed
by the financial crisis

00:58:16.666 --> 00:58:19.107
and the Great Recession, that
was the overwhelming concern.

00:58:19.107 --> 00:58:22.778
And then the book came out
and Black Lives Matter,

00:58:22.778 --> 00:58:24.238
and Ferguson, and Trayvon Martin,

00:58:24.238 --> 00:58:26.738
and other calamities followed,

00:58:28.391 --> 00:58:31.825
and then Ta-Nehisi wrote Between
the World and Me in 2015,

00:58:31.825 --> 00:58:34.489
and the entire conversation had changed.

00:58:34.489 --> 00:58:36.903
So in some ways The Unwinding is,

00:58:36.903 --> 00:58:38.450
all books are product of their moment,

00:58:38.450 --> 00:58:40.619
and The Unwinding is the
product of a moment that,

00:58:40.619 --> 00:58:41.744
although it hasn't disappeared,

00:58:41.744 --> 00:58:44.687
it was in some ways overshadowed.

00:58:44.687 --> 00:58:47.569
And I would have to say yeah,
it's a bit of a blind spot

00:58:47.569 --> 00:58:52.174
in that book, because it's
not the fundamental category

00:58:52.174 --> 00:58:53.949
in which people are living their lives,

00:58:53.949 --> 00:58:56.024
it wasn't the way they
presented themselves to me,

00:58:56.024 --> 00:58:58.913
because in that book, they have the word,

00:58:58.913 --> 00:59:02.181
that book channels their
language, their ideas,

00:59:02.181 --> 00:59:04.166
their narratives into stories,

00:59:04.166 --> 00:59:07.083
so it's not my own control over it,

00:59:08.407 --> 00:59:09.957
it's their way of presenting themselves.

00:59:09.957 --> 00:59:12.447
But I think I missed something,

00:59:12.447 --> 00:59:16.409
or at least something came up
that reminded me and everyone

00:59:16.409 --> 00:59:18.250
of something more fundamental, I think,

00:59:18.250 --> 00:59:20.023
than class in America, which is race,

00:59:20.023 --> 00:59:22.468
and that was Ta-Nehisi's
interpretation of the election.

00:59:22.468 --> 00:59:26.192
I think his interpretation was brilliant,

00:59:26.192 --> 00:59:30.010
rhetorically powerful, I
wrote that in my response,

00:59:30.010 --> 00:59:33.745
but also too narrow, and too simplistic,

00:59:33.745 --> 00:59:36.794
it oversimplified the
election to one cause only,

00:59:36.794 --> 00:59:39.379
and that cause explained everything,

00:59:39.379 --> 00:59:43.546
and was transhistorical, and
subsumed all individual choices

00:59:44.597 --> 00:59:47.147
and distinctions between
working class and other

00:59:47.147 --> 00:59:49.490
into one thing, and I thought,

00:59:49.490 --> 00:59:51.927
first of all, intellectually
I think that's a mistake,

00:59:51.927 --> 00:59:56.094
but politically it's a
mistake too because it makes,

00:59:57.255 --> 01:00:01.360
it makes Trump unbeatable,
to be really simple about it,

01:00:01.360 --> 01:00:03.978
it means that Trump wins.

01:00:03.978 --> 01:00:06.861
So he and I went back and forth in

01:00:06.861 --> 01:00:09.125
what some people thought
was kind of a model

01:00:09.125 --> 01:00:13.292
of civil argument, and I
hope we're still friends.

01:00:14.244 --> 01:00:17.051
(audience chuckling)

01:00:17.051 --> 01:00:21.035
- [Audience Member] Taking this
diagnosis to Trump America,

01:00:21.035 --> 01:00:23.601
how do you adapt this, or how
do you feel the response is

01:00:23.601 --> 01:00:25.721
when you take this very clear-headed,

01:00:25.721 --> 01:00:29.888
and quite objective diagnosis
of the American situation

01:00:31.173 --> 01:00:33.704
to the very people that
you are critiquing,

01:00:33.704 --> 01:00:37.748
who you've spoken to so much?
- Yeah, yeah.

01:00:37.748 --> 01:00:40.993
I'll tell you, it's not easy, because

01:00:40.993 --> 01:00:43.234
we don't speak the same
language in some ways,

01:00:43.234 --> 01:00:46.539
and once it's in the realm
of politics and media

01:00:46.539 --> 01:00:49.789
rather than of two individuals talking,

01:00:50.672 --> 01:00:54.339
it becomes saturated
in cliches, soundbites,

01:00:57.473 --> 01:01:01.390
and hostile categories
that you can't get past.

01:01:03.332 --> 01:01:07.558
I like long, long
conversations with people

01:01:07.558 --> 01:01:10.475
outside of the arena of public life

01:01:11.768 --> 01:01:14.772
so that I can get to know them
and get past the soundbite

01:01:14.772 --> 01:01:17.722
that is always their first response.

01:01:17.722 --> 01:01:19.778
When you read about a small town

01:01:19.778 --> 01:01:21.899
in Indiana in The New York Times,

01:01:21.899 --> 01:01:23.882
the reporter doesn't have
time to do more than talk

01:01:23.882 --> 01:01:25.855
to eight people for half an hour,

01:01:25.855 --> 01:01:28.945
and you get the soundbites, and
you never feel as if you've,

01:01:28.945 --> 01:01:31.420
I don't, that I've gotten beyond,

01:01:31.420 --> 01:01:32.952
I don't wanna critique The Times too much

01:01:32.952 --> 01:01:35.574
'cause they also do
longer and deeper work,

01:01:35.574 --> 01:01:38.814
but the pressure of a daily
paper means you can't,

01:01:38.814 --> 01:01:41.697
and writing a book is a privilege

01:01:41.697 --> 01:01:44.198
and a luxury because I can.

01:01:44.198 --> 01:01:48.552
But at this point, when
it comes to things like

01:01:48.552 --> 01:01:53.128
is pedophilia disqualifying
for a Senate candidate?

01:01:53.128 --> 01:01:55.878
Or do I trust Vladimir Putin more

01:01:56.871 --> 01:01:58.754
than the intelligence agencies,

01:01:58.754 --> 01:02:02.921
or was Trump's inauguration
crowd the largest in history,

01:02:04.300 --> 01:02:07.383
these are not, to me, open to debate,

01:02:08.322 --> 01:02:11.438
and it's really difficult
to run up against

01:02:11.438 --> 01:02:14.404
a fundamental disagreement that in my view

01:02:14.404 --> 01:02:15.834
is not even debatable.

01:02:15.834 --> 01:02:19.569
And that is the point
that I left you with,

01:02:19.569 --> 01:02:22.902
where we are all part of the same place,

01:02:25.338 --> 01:02:27.582
and yet we don't know how
to talk to each other.

01:02:27.582 --> 01:02:29.830
I'd say one lesson for journalists

01:02:29.830 --> 01:02:32.342
coming out of the election
was we need to get outside

01:02:32.342 --> 01:02:36.529
our own bubbles, and we need
to learn how to talk and listen

01:02:36.529 --> 01:02:39.548
to Americans who don't think
like the people we know,

01:02:39.548 --> 01:02:42.468
and then we can really
disagree vehemently,

01:02:42.468 --> 01:02:44.717
not condescend to them,
but at least learn,

01:02:44.717 --> 01:02:45.852
again, how to listen to them.

01:02:45.852 --> 01:02:47.022
That's all I can say

01:02:47.022 --> 01:02:48.519
because it's a really difficult problem,

01:02:48.519 --> 01:02:50.605
we're two countries at this point.

01:02:50.605 --> 01:02:51.586
Yes sir.

01:02:51.586 --> 01:02:52.962
- [Audience Member] When
you talk about people

01:02:52.962 --> 01:02:54.712
who feel left behind,

01:02:56.028 --> 01:02:59.793
and a government that
does not respond to them,

01:02:59.793 --> 01:03:04.517
are they aware that one
party is trying to offer them

01:03:04.517 --> 01:03:07.324
increased minimum wages and healthcare,

01:03:07.324 --> 01:03:09.634
and another party is trying to deny them

01:03:09.634 --> 01:03:11.240
both.
- And, I mean,

01:03:11.240 --> 01:03:13.941
that is such a good, the
other day I was riding

01:03:13.941 --> 01:03:17.191
in a shuttle van in Ohio with a guy who

01:03:18.929 --> 01:03:23.434
was mountainous and my age,
but looked 20 years older,

01:03:23.434 --> 01:03:25.441
and had a long white
beard, and I just knew

01:03:25.441 --> 01:03:26.599
this guy voted for Trump.

01:03:26.599 --> 01:03:28.380
So I said, we're gonna have half an hour

01:03:28.380 --> 01:03:29.681
in our lives together, just tell me

01:03:29.681 --> 01:03:31.636
what do you think of Trump?

01:03:31.636 --> 01:03:33.801
And he sort of liked the invitation,

01:03:33.801 --> 01:03:36.270
and told me he'd voted for him,

01:03:36.270 --> 01:03:38.982
and thought that the
media was not fair to him,

01:03:38.982 --> 01:03:40.595
and I said, "What's your
most important issue?"

01:03:40.595 --> 01:03:42.730
and he said, "Healthcare."

01:03:42.730 --> 01:03:44.296
(audience laughing)

01:03:44.296 --> 01:03:47.918
And I said, "Well, do
you think repealing,"

01:03:47.918 --> 01:03:49.019
I said, "Do you have health insurance?"

01:03:49.019 --> 01:03:51.502
he said, "I've been working
for this company for 15 years,

01:03:51.502 --> 01:03:52.641
"they never gave me health insurance,

01:03:52.641 --> 01:03:55.554
"I finally had to buy it
on one of the exchanges,

01:03:55.554 --> 01:03:57.957
"but my deductibles are too
high," blah, blah, blah.

01:03:57.957 --> 01:04:01.496
I said, "Do you think repealing
it would help or hurt?"

01:04:01.496 --> 01:04:03.821
He said, "Well, that's
a complicated question,

01:04:03.821 --> 01:04:05.367
"it depends on what they replace it with."

01:04:05.367 --> 01:04:09.284
And we could've gone down
that road a long way,

01:04:10.329 --> 01:04:13.136
but I also sensed that
we wouldn't get very far

01:04:13.136 --> 01:04:16.150
because as I said in the talk,

01:04:16.150 --> 01:04:18.474
policy is not what this is about,

01:04:18.474 --> 01:04:23.386
somehow the tribes are
immune to policy arguments,

01:04:23.386 --> 01:04:26.457
this is about identity,
this is about who I am,

01:04:26.457 --> 01:04:28.985
who you are, what it
means to be an American,

01:04:28.985 --> 01:04:31.370
and for him, what it
means to be an American

01:04:31.370 --> 01:04:35.482
is to be a Trump supporter,
regardless of his healthcare,

01:04:35.482 --> 01:04:37.851
regardless of the minimum wage.

01:04:37.851 --> 01:04:40.115
That's why when Hillary
Clinton went down her list

01:04:40.115 --> 01:04:43.574
of things she's doing to
help the working class,

01:04:43.574 --> 01:04:45.589
my heart was sinking
because I was thinking,

01:04:45.589 --> 01:04:49.445
oh, these are such fine,
slightly small bore,

01:04:49.445 --> 01:04:51.780
I wish they were more ambitious,
but they're fine ideas,

01:04:51.780 --> 01:04:55.780
they won't matter, our
politics right now is not

01:04:56.677 --> 01:04:58.345
settled on that ground.

01:04:58.345 --> 01:05:00.594
Maybe it once was, I
don't know, but right now

01:05:00.594 --> 01:05:02.974
we're talking about tribal identity,

01:05:02.974 --> 01:05:05.660
and that to me is just a deadly thing.

01:05:05.660 --> 01:05:09.396
So your question is to
the point, my answer is,

01:05:09.396 --> 01:05:12.063
I don't think that gets through,

01:05:13.359 --> 01:05:16.990
it's not where people live right now.

01:05:16.990 --> 01:05:17.823
Yes sir.

01:05:22.238 --> 01:05:23.997
- [Audience Member] From
the end of your talk,

01:05:23.997 --> 01:05:26.349
and the emphasis on the word citizen,

01:05:26.349 --> 01:05:27.824
I guess that you are very concerned

01:05:27.824 --> 01:05:31.129
about vote suppression.
- Yeah.

01:05:31.129 --> 01:05:32.430
- [Audience Member] What's
to be done about that?

01:05:32.430 --> 01:05:35.972
- Vote suppression, as
a threat to citizenship

01:05:35.972 --> 01:05:37.942
and what's to be done.

01:05:37.942 --> 01:05:41.775
I'd say vote out Republican
state legislatures

01:05:43.586 --> 01:05:45.488
and governors.

01:05:45.488 --> 01:05:49.155
That's where it happens,
at the state level,

01:05:50.196 --> 01:05:53.414
the federal government
now has a commission

01:05:53.414 --> 01:05:57.081
led by Mike Pence to
investigate vote fraud,

01:05:58.546 --> 01:06:02.213
which is the handmaiden
of vote suppression.

01:06:03.926 --> 01:06:06.107
It doesn't seem to be
getting all that far,

01:06:06.107 --> 01:06:07.865
but it's in the states that it happens,

01:06:07.865 --> 01:06:10.948
and what Democrats somehow missed out

01:06:13.460 --> 01:06:18.433
was that during the Obama
years they lost 1,000 seats

01:06:18.433 --> 01:06:21.330
in Congress, in the
Senate, in state houses,

01:06:21.330 --> 01:06:25.205
and governorships, and they
forgot about local politics,

01:06:25.205 --> 01:06:27.585
which is where citizenship
probably should begin.

01:06:27.585 --> 01:06:31.257
So I would say if you are
concerned about voter suppression

01:06:31.257 --> 01:06:34.507
vote out Republican state legislatures.

01:06:37.022 --> 01:06:37.855
Yeah.

01:06:40.776 --> 01:06:43.703
- [Audience Member] Thank you very much.

01:06:43.703 --> 01:06:45.077
A lot of ideas that I've
been thinking about,

01:06:45.077 --> 01:06:46.567
and you kinda left it out there,

01:06:46.567 --> 01:06:48.023
a suggestion for a new narrative,

01:06:48.023 --> 01:06:51.143
and I'm looking to become
the medium and inspire it,

01:06:51.143 --> 01:06:52.735
I consider myself a progressive,

01:06:52.735 --> 01:06:54.900
and I think maybe one of the avenues,

01:06:54.900 --> 01:06:57.293
just like you're doing
on a personal level,

01:06:57.293 --> 01:06:59.393
is to connect with people in a language

01:06:59.393 --> 01:07:00.400
that they understand.

01:07:00.400 --> 01:07:02.520
And in culture, faith, and tradition,

01:07:02.520 --> 01:07:04.686
these are hard things to break through,

01:07:04.686 --> 01:07:08.708
one of the things that
I'm trying to do is to,

01:07:08.708 --> 01:07:12.051
like when I hear Tommy
Lawrence say that faith,

01:07:12.051 --> 01:07:14.967
when I see Faith First, and then I say

01:07:14.967 --> 01:07:17.510
you rail against social justice warriors,

01:07:17.510 --> 01:07:20.939
wasn't Jesus a social
justice warrior Tommy?

01:07:20.939 --> 01:07:22.652
Pose questions like that,

01:07:22.652 --> 01:07:24.984
and also do it in a way like Matt Taibbi,

01:07:24.984 --> 01:07:27.092
I've been reading Matt Taibbi, McChesney,

01:07:27.092 --> 01:07:29.809
which John Nichols introduced me to.

01:07:29.809 --> 01:07:32.601
Matt Taibbi is funny, he's irreverent,

01:07:32.601 --> 01:07:35.230
he is talking to a
language in these people

01:07:35.230 --> 01:07:37.645
that they understand, so,
oh you're right, I'm sorry,

01:07:37.645 --> 01:07:41.443
so the question is, would
a good new narrative

01:07:41.443 --> 01:07:44.047
moving forward be to connect with people

01:07:44.047 --> 01:07:45.883
in a language that they understand,

01:07:45.883 --> 01:07:48.317
in an irreverent, progressive, aggressive,

01:07:48.317 --> 01:07:50.524
just like you said at the end.

01:07:50.524 --> 01:07:53.346
Being more militant does that mean

01:07:53.346 --> 01:07:56.259
just being more irreverent,
like a Matt Taibbi?

01:07:56.259 --> 01:07:59.194
- Well, I have problems with Matt Taibbi,

01:07:59.194 --> 01:08:02.012
mainly because of his book from Russia

01:08:02.012 --> 01:08:04.845
that is disgustingly misogynistic,

01:08:05.778 --> 01:08:07.766
and he somehow launched
a career on that basis

01:08:07.766 --> 01:08:12.694
and was only called out on
it in the last few weeks.

01:08:12.694 --> 01:08:15.515
On the other hand, he's a great wordsmith,

01:08:15.515 --> 01:08:17.507
and the image of the vampire squid

01:08:17.507 --> 01:08:19.156
wrapped around the face of humanity

01:08:19.156 --> 01:08:21.404
jamming its blood funnel relentlessly

01:08:21.404 --> 01:08:23.430
into anything that smells like money

01:08:23.430 --> 01:08:25.962
is an unforgettable image, so.

01:08:25.962 --> 01:08:27.538
(audience chuckling)

01:08:27.538 --> 01:08:31.455
This gets to writing,
and what is good writing,

01:08:32.812 --> 01:08:36.803
and I mention, I quoted that
Kirkus passage at length

01:08:36.803 --> 01:08:41.588
'cause to me it was an example
of very typical bad writing,

01:08:41.588 --> 01:08:46.175
which is trying to disguise
what it really means.

01:08:46.175 --> 01:08:48.726
People know when you're hiding,

01:08:48.726 --> 01:08:51.932
people know when you're doing an Enron,

01:08:51.932 --> 01:08:54.698
or when you're condescending to them,

01:08:54.698 --> 01:08:57.256
and if you speak directly, I think people,

01:08:57.256 --> 01:08:58.837
there's an ability, I think,

01:08:58.837 --> 01:09:03.484
to respect an honest disagreement,
if it's honestly stated,

01:09:03.484 --> 01:09:05.567
but if it's either phony,

01:09:07.565 --> 01:09:10.632
or if it's vicious, and viciousness is,

01:09:10.632 --> 01:09:12.692
I don't think does very much good either

01:09:12.692 --> 01:09:15.156
because it dehumanizes people,
and it gives them the feeling

01:09:15.156 --> 01:09:18.714
that you'll never be
able to understand them.

01:09:18.714 --> 01:09:21.502
Yeah, that kinda language
may be a starting point

01:09:21.502 --> 01:09:22.957
for a better politics.

01:09:22.957 --> 01:09:24.519
- [Audience Member] Using the crystal ball

01:09:24.519 --> 01:09:27.431
that you probably have
under the podium there,

01:09:27.431 --> 01:09:29.658
if current trends continue,

01:09:29.658 --> 01:09:32.544
where do you think the
country will be in 10 years?

01:09:32.544 --> 01:09:33.615
(audience laughing)

01:09:33.615 --> 01:09:34.660
- Great.

01:09:34.660 --> 01:09:36.463
This is the question I dread.

01:09:36.463 --> 01:09:37.905
(audience laughing)

01:09:37.905 --> 01:09:40.072
I am not a prognosticator.

01:09:43.255 --> 01:09:45.029
But I think we'll continue to be divided

01:09:45.029 --> 01:09:48.537
'cause it's profound, and
it's not gonna be resolved

01:09:48.537 --> 01:09:50.469
by some middle-of-the-road politician

01:09:50.469 --> 01:09:52.118
who can speak to both sides,

01:09:52.118 --> 01:09:55.701
these are profound
disagreements of values.

01:09:56.751 --> 01:10:00.918
I do think that when the
weather shifts politically,

01:10:02.026 --> 01:10:04.531
and it happens in the most mysterious ways

01:10:04.531 --> 01:10:06.760
without our political
scientists and journalists

01:10:06.760 --> 01:10:10.927
really understanding it,
then a movement or a leader

01:10:12.231 --> 01:10:16.398
emerges who answers an already
new and existing longing.

01:10:19.917 --> 01:10:23.591
Franklin Roosevelt did that,
Ronald Reagan did that,

01:10:23.591 --> 01:10:26.942
I didn't like it, but he did that.

01:10:26.942 --> 01:10:30.134
I thought Barack Obama
was that leader in 2008,

01:10:30.134 --> 01:10:32.088
I thought the weather has shifted,

01:10:32.088 --> 01:10:35.823
and we're in a new era of progressivism.

01:10:35.823 --> 01:10:37.211
That turned out not to be true,

01:10:37.211 --> 01:10:40.878
we were in an era of
deep and ugly division,

01:10:41.742 --> 01:10:44.409
and Obama's race intensified it.

01:10:45.896 --> 01:10:49.409
So somehow the weather will shift.

01:10:49.409 --> 01:10:51.220
I'm hoping it will shift in a direction

01:10:51.220 --> 01:10:54.720
where local citizens, and local government

01:10:55.736 --> 01:10:58.822
starts solving problems
that have been festering

01:10:58.822 --> 01:11:00.913
for a long time, and that
the national government

01:11:00.913 --> 01:11:02.086
is incapable of solving,

01:11:02.086 --> 01:11:05.586
because it's so Balkanized and tribalized.

01:11:06.576 --> 01:11:09.164
And then that will spread,
it happened once before

01:11:09.164 --> 01:11:12.650
in a rather similar era,
the Progressive Age,

01:11:12.650 --> 01:11:15.079
when we had the robber baron class,

01:11:15.079 --> 01:11:18.603
we had immigration and
concerns about immigration,

01:11:18.603 --> 01:11:20.837
and we had profound inequalities

01:11:20.837 --> 01:11:22.874
and corruption in government.

01:11:22.874 --> 01:11:26.074
And the Progressive Era started locally,

01:11:26.074 --> 01:11:28.428
and all over the country
in all these out-of-the-way

01:11:28.428 --> 01:11:30.624
and diverse places, and
no one saw it as a thing

01:11:30.624 --> 01:11:32.723
until it began to coalesce.

01:11:32.723 --> 01:11:34.664
I think Trump is gonna accelerate this

01:11:34.664 --> 01:11:38.347
because he is such a threat to democracy

01:11:38.347 --> 01:11:41.108
that unless you're just a blind partisan,

01:11:41.108 --> 01:11:44.274
you're gonna start to
think that we have to find

01:11:44.274 --> 01:11:45.318
a different way.

01:11:45.318 --> 01:11:47.219
He's crystallized things,

01:11:47.219 --> 01:11:50.554
he's like an accelerant, an enzyme,

01:11:50.554 --> 01:11:53.493
but I don't know how it's gonna happen,

01:11:53.493 --> 01:11:54.632
I don't know if it's gonna happen,

01:11:54.632 --> 01:11:57.511
that would be my hope though.

01:11:57.511 --> 01:11:58.868
Yes.

01:11:58.868 --> 01:12:00.272
- [Audience Member] Hi.

01:12:00.272 --> 01:12:05.086
Until about two months ago I
was an American ambassador.

01:12:05.086 --> 01:12:06.384
Like a lot of my colleagues I've left

01:12:06.384 --> 01:12:07.663
the State Department.
- Wow,

01:12:07.663 --> 01:12:08.496
where were you?

01:12:08.496 --> 01:12:09.741
Can you say, or is it?
- I can,

01:12:09.741 --> 01:12:12.306
it was the Central African Republic.

01:12:12.306 --> 01:12:17.030
And obviously a huge debate
in the State Department,

01:12:17.030 --> 01:12:18.101
and other places in the government,

01:12:18.101 --> 01:12:21.501
is should I stay or should I go?

01:12:21.501 --> 01:12:24.953
And whether it's the military
officers in the White House,

01:12:24.953 --> 01:12:26.439
supposed-to-be-adults in the room,

01:12:26.439 --> 01:12:29.804
or ambassadors like myself,
or other people in government,

01:12:29.804 --> 01:12:31.901
or just plain citizens,

01:12:31.901 --> 01:12:36.346
should we engage with this
administration and try and

01:12:36.346 --> 01:12:39.307
mitigate some of its worst tendencies,

01:12:39.307 --> 01:12:41.740
or does it make more sense to leave?

01:12:41.740 --> 01:12:42.885
- And you decided to leave,

01:12:42.885 --> 01:12:45.671
or?
- I decided to leave, yeah.

01:12:45.671 --> 01:12:48.157
- I can't say I blame you.

01:12:48.157 --> 01:12:49.379
(audience chuckling)

01:12:49.379 --> 01:12:52.155
But, as you know better than I,

01:12:52.155 --> 01:12:55.226
the foreign service is bleeding,

01:12:55.226 --> 01:12:58.584
the State Department is
a hollow shell right now,

01:12:58.584 --> 01:13:01.908
there's nobody home, so our diplomacy,

01:13:01.908 --> 01:13:04.466
which was already on its heels,

01:13:04.466 --> 01:13:08.782
has been completely turned
over to the Pentagon.

01:13:08.782 --> 01:13:11.804
And foreign countries, foreign,

01:13:11.804 --> 01:13:13.667
you probably heard this in CAR,

01:13:13.667 --> 01:13:15.414
I've certainly heard it
from European ambassadors,

01:13:15.414 --> 01:13:17.919
they're just, what is going on,

01:13:17.919 --> 01:13:19.835
how long is this gonna go on for,

01:13:19.835 --> 01:13:22.952
how do we wait it out,
can we just wait it out?

01:13:22.952 --> 01:13:25.369
Should we take out insurance?

01:13:26.212 --> 01:13:28.129
I asked one ambassador,

01:13:30.012 --> 01:13:34.965
"Is this gonna permanently
damage our relations with Europe,

01:13:34.965 --> 01:13:38.465
"with NATO, with our allies?" and he said,

01:13:40.360 --> 01:13:43.860
"If it's one term, it might be remediable,

01:13:46.004 --> 01:13:49.219
"but if it's two terms
it'll be permanent,"

01:13:49.219 --> 01:13:52.071
that America will cease
to be seen as a partner

01:13:52.071 --> 01:13:56.238
for rules and rights, and
the global post-war order

01:13:59.794 --> 01:14:02.722
that we helped to build,
that we essentially built,

01:14:02.722 --> 01:14:04.590
and that makes me, that's what my

01:14:04.590 --> 01:14:05.901
current book project's about,

01:14:05.901 --> 01:14:09.169
but that makes me sad to think of that.

01:14:09.169 --> 01:14:11.432
Anyway, I totally respect your decision,

01:14:11.432 --> 01:14:16.217
I can't imagine continuing to
try to serve under a president

01:14:16.217 --> 01:14:19.767
who makes a mockery of
everything you're doing.

01:14:19.767 --> 01:14:21.498
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

01:14:21.498 --> 01:14:24.665
(audience applauding)

01:14:27.799 --> 01:14:29.859
- [Audience Member] When I
think of the possibilities

01:14:29.859 --> 01:14:32.376
of a narrative of citizenship,

01:14:32.376 --> 01:14:33.533
one of the things that comes to mind

01:14:33.533 --> 01:14:36.218
is one of the bright
spots you didn't mention,

01:14:36.218 --> 01:14:38.633
and that was the Bernie Sanders campaign

01:14:38.633 --> 01:14:40.716
during the last election.

01:14:41.553 --> 01:14:44.851
It was a campaign that
was characterized both by

01:14:44.851 --> 01:14:48.239
serious substance, of content, policy,

01:14:48.239 --> 01:14:52.322
but also by a certain kind
of form that was non-vicious,

01:14:52.322 --> 01:14:56.381
non-recriminatory except
for the billionaire class,

01:14:56.381 --> 01:15:00.366
and it seemed to me to
contain a potential to capture

01:15:00.366 --> 01:15:03.576
and envelope many of the
tribes that you talked about,

01:15:03.576 --> 01:15:06.436
I just wondered what
you thought about that.

01:15:06.436 --> 01:15:10.737
- It's a great point, I thought
about a fifth narrative,

01:15:10.737 --> 01:15:14.904
which you could call the
Sanders-Warren America narrative,

01:15:16.223 --> 01:15:18.842
and there's an arbitrariness
to the talk I gave,

01:15:18.842 --> 01:15:20.947
you could cut it a different way.

01:15:20.947 --> 01:15:25.114
I left it out, and that's
my tribe, if I have a tribe,

01:15:26.697 --> 01:15:28.848
that's the closest I've got,

01:15:28.848 --> 01:15:31.066
I don't know that it's
as strong a narrative

01:15:31.066 --> 01:15:33.149
for a large number of us.

01:15:36.778 --> 01:15:40.111
It lit a fire for a lot of young people,

01:15:41.312 --> 01:15:45.485
for people on the Left, and
for some of the working class

01:15:45.485 --> 01:15:46.866
that ended up voting for Trump,

01:15:46.866 --> 01:15:49.100
a small part of that I'd guess.

01:15:49.100 --> 01:15:50.017
But it's...

01:15:54.027 --> 01:15:57.340
It's an economic argument, and right now

01:15:57.340 --> 01:16:00.862
people seem motivated differently,

01:16:00.862 --> 01:16:02.569
and that's why I left it out,

01:16:02.569 --> 01:16:03.870
I could easily have included it,

01:16:03.870 --> 01:16:06.870
and I think if I have any hope in a,

01:16:09.450 --> 01:16:11.805
if not a narrative, at
least in policy answers,

01:16:11.805 --> 01:16:14.499
that's where they are, I just wonder

01:16:14.499 --> 01:16:18.124
if it's ever gonna get political traction.

01:16:18.124 --> 01:16:19.471
Thanks.

01:16:19.471 --> 01:16:21.804
Yeah, last question I guess.

01:16:22.779 --> 01:16:25.835
- [Audience Member] You
probably read some history,

01:16:25.835 --> 01:16:30.481
and in this room there's
probably more than one person

01:16:30.481 --> 01:16:31.981
who reads history.

01:16:33.736 --> 01:16:37.607
Could you tell us what you
find useful and interesting

01:16:37.607 --> 01:16:39.614
in the history that you're reading,

01:16:39.614 --> 01:16:42.979
and what kind of history might you imagine

01:16:42.979 --> 01:16:46.647
would be useful and
interesting in the future?

01:16:46.647 --> 01:16:49.756
- That's a great question,
I love that question.

01:16:49.756 --> 01:16:52.245
My favorites are pretty old fashioned,

01:16:52.245 --> 01:16:54.599
the academic historians might think

01:16:54.599 --> 01:16:56.599
I'm a bit of a dinosaur.

01:16:58.372 --> 01:17:02.409
I love Richard Hofstadter,
who may have been wrong

01:17:02.409 --> 01:17:06.152
in some ways about the reform movement

01:17:06.152 --> 01:17:10.068
of the early 20th century,
but who writes so well,

01:17:10.068 --> 01:17:13.985
and who is so humane and
wise that I just wanna

01:17:16.505 --> 01:17:19.047
turn to his pages whenever
I'm feeling dismal

01:17:19.047 --> 01:17:21.134
about our politics.

01:17:21.134 --> 01:17:23.061
When I was working on The
Unwinding I was reading

01:17:23.061 --> 01:17:24.478
a lot of fiction.

01:17:25.579 --> 01:17:29.969
I was reading John Dos
Passos, whose U.S.A. trilogy

01:17:29.969 --> 01:17:32.386
is a great inventive portrait

01:17:33.380 --> 01:17:35.644
of the first part of the 20th century,

01:17:35.644 --> 01:17:38.232
and inspired some of the techniques I used

01:17:38.232 --> 01:17:42.232
in The Unwinding, and is,
again, it's about two,

01:17:43.479 --> 01:17:45.657
the most famous line in
all three volumes is,

01:17:45.657 --> 01:17:48.019
"Alright, we are two nations,"

01:17:48.019 --> 01:17:52.186
which is the moment of the
Sacco and Vanzetti execution,

01:17:53.466 --> 01:17:55.832
that is the epitaph on our own era,

01:17:55.832 --> 01:17:58.344
alright, we are two nations.

01:17:58.344 --> 01:18:00.163
And I was reading Edmund Wilson's

01:18:00.163 --> 01:18:04.193
journalism from the Depression, the 30s,

01:18:04.193 --> 01:18:06.539
and the American Earthquake,
these are obscure books,

01:18:06.539 --> 01:18:10.206
but they remind you
that there's always been

01:18:11.203 --> 01:18:14.620
a degree of hopelessness and of division,

01:18:15.987 --> 01:18:17.537
maybe deeper than now, I don't know,

01:18:17.537 --> 01:18:19.787
and of rage, violence even.

01:18:20.868 --> 01:18:24.201
But there's also been individuals who...

01:18:29.173 --> 01:18:30.825
The words I used I chose carefully

01:18:30.825 --> 01:18:33.692
about American democracy,
those words have a,

01:18:33.692 --> 01:18:36.859
kind of a charge that animated people,

01:18:38.794 --> 01:18:42.835
and I hope still animate
people, they mean something,

01:18:42.835 --> 01:18:45.539
they have a value, and
the value is to be found

01:18:45.539 --> 01:18:46.789
in our history.

01:18:47.705 --> 01:18:50.365
Which doesn't mean we
look at it uncritically,

01:18:50.365 --> 01:18:52.168
we look at it very critically,

01:18:52.168 --> 01:18:56.145
but we look at it, and we
look to it for the meaning

01:18:56.145 --> 01:18:58.167
of why we continue to think it matters

01:18:58.167 --> 01:19:01.246
to live in a democracy,
that is not a guarantee,

01:19:01.246 --> 01:19:03.577
that could disappear.

01:19:03.577 --> 01:19:05.638
If you came away from
my talk with anything,

01:19:05.638 --> 01:19:09.260
that would be what I wanna
say, this could disappear,

01:19:09.260 --> 01:19:11.893
it has disappeared, it has taken more hits

01:19:11.893 --> 01:19:14.726
in the last year than I can count.

01:19:16.470 --> 01:19:18.637
So it needs us to want it.

01:19:20.786 --> 01:19:22.612
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

01:19:22.612 --> 01:19:25.779
(audience applauding)

01:19:26.702 --> 01:19:29.869
(light, upbeat music)
