00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:05.793
Cramming isn’t the ideal way to study for an exam

00:00:05.825 --> 00:00:07.047
but you’re here

00:00:07.063 --> 00:00:10.338
you’ve come to this video likely with an exam tomorrow

00:00:10.346 --> 00:00:12.043
or...in a few hours

00:00:12.068 --> 00:00:14.266
so let’s focus on what you can do

00:00:14.291 --> 00:00:15.625
to optimize your time.

00:00:15.632 --> 00:00:19.157
How do you effectively cram for your exam?

00:00:19.157 --> 00:00:20.688
You might not be able to learn a lot

00:00:20.721 --> 00:00:22.343
but you can store a bunch of information

00:00:22.367 --> 00:00:24.234
into your short term memory.

00:00:24.241 --> 00:00:27.597
Try using the ancient technique of the Memory Palace.

00:00:27.606 --> 00:00:29.708
Dated back as far as 80 B.C.

00:00:29.714 --> 00:00:33.057
this technique involves associating ideas you want to memorize

00:00:33.065 --> 00:00:34.950
with memorable places like your home.

00:00:34.964 --> 00:00:37.600
One study had medical students create Memory Palaces

00:00:37.609 --> 00:00:40.116
to help them remember the actions of insulin

00:00:40.133 --> 00:00:40.910
in this example

00:00:40.934 --> 00:00:43.540
you might store glycosis in your living room

00:00:43.548 --> 00:00:45.286
and ketogenesis in the kitchen.

00:00:45.294 --> 00:00:47.452
Then you can mentally travel through your house

00:00:47.453 --> 00:00:48.730
to recall each room.

00:00:48.746 --> 00:00:50.270
Those who create memory palaces

00:00:50.273 --> 00:00:52.376
perform significantly better on tests

00:00:52.392 --> 00:00:53.479
than those who don’t.

00:00:53.487 --> 00:00:54.971
And the reasons for this is that

00:00:54.996 --> 00:00:57.360
our visual and spatial memory is quite strong

00:00:57.364 --> 00:00:59.162
and connecting information to those

00:00:59.178 --> 00:01:02.218
already existing memories proves extremely effective.

00:01:02.226 --> 00:01:05.388
You should also try mnemonic devices wherever possible.

00:01:05.396 --> 00:01:07.173
Trying to memorize the Kreb's Cycle?

00:01:07.198 --> 00:01:08.872
Take the beginning of each product,

00:01:08.897 --> 00:01:10.586
and make a sentence out of it!

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:14.130
'Can I keep singing songs for my Oscars?''

00:01:14.139 --> 00:01:17.297
You can also create rhymes or songs.

00:01:17.321 --> 00:01:19.903
This method has been proven in several studies

00:01:19.911 --> 00:01:22.077
as a way of committing information to memory

00:01:22.094 --> 00:01:23.998
And the weirder you make them, the better!

00:01:24.022 --> 00:01:28.149
Now, does your exam prep include rereading your notes and text book?

00:01:28.181 --> 00:01:31.106
You’re not alone - but you should cut it out!

00:01:31.138 --> 00:01:33.963
A study had participants read an educational text.

00:01:33.994 --> 00:01:37.813
One group was then instructed to reread the text a second time

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:40.136
where the other group only read it once.

00:01:40.152 --> 00:01:42.239
They were then tested through multiple choice,

00:01:42.264 --> 00:01:44.636
short-answer questions, and text summaries

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:47.299
to gauge their ability to retain the information.

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:50.188
The experimenters found no significant differences

00:01:50.213 --> 00:01:52.188
in performance between the two groups

00:01:52.205 --> 00:01:55.744
suggesting that rereading provides no clear benefit.

00:01:55.754 --> 00:01:57.838
And while we know exams are stressful,

00:01:57.863 --> 00:01:59.212
put some energy into de-stressing

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.620
while studying and during your exam.

00:02:01.633 --> 00:02:04.106
Stress causes your body to release adrenaline,

00:02:04.114 --> 00:02:06.550
increases your heart rate, and can make you sweat.

00:02:06.559 --> 00:02:08.844
And about 20 minutes after feeling stressed,

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.463
your body undergoes a delayed stress response,

00:02:11.488 --> 00:02:13.163
releasing the hormone cortisol.

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.735
Cortisol attaches to receptors on the hippocampus,

00:02:15.751 --> 00:02:18.454
which is a seahorse shaped region of your brain

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.271
that is part of the limbic system.

00:02:20.296 --> 00:02:22.724
And it’s the hippocampus that’s responsible for

00:02:22.732 --> 00:02:26.015
turning short term memories into long term memories.

00:02:26.039 --> 00:02:28.380
But when cortisol binds to the hippocampus,

00:02:28.396 --> 00:02:30.530
it impairs retrieval of memory.

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.237
Therefore if you are stressed

00:02:32.262 --> 00:02:35.899
you will have a more difficult time recalling information during an exam.

00:02:35.916 --> 00:02:37.716
So take some deep breaths!

00:02:37.717 --> 00:02:40.733
But just “turning off” stress is easier said than done

00:02:40.741 --> 00:02:43.615
that’s why you need a study technique that is stress proof.

00:02:43.631 --> 00:02:46.035
Scientists recommend testing yourself!

00:02:46.044 --> 00:02:49.170
Practice tests are not only a scientifically supported means

00:02:49.187 --> 00:02:50.950
of improving memory recall,

00:02:50.975 --> 00:02:53.799
they stand up to stressful situations.

00:02:53.815 --> 00:02:56.807
Scientists found that when individuals used practice tests

00:02:56.831 --> 00:02:58.712
and were put into a stressful situation

00:02:58.737 --> 00:03:02.653
they performed as well on tests as those who didn’t have any stress stimulus.

00:03:02.662 --> 00:03:05.399
fMRI studies have also found that practice tests

00:03:05.432 --> 00:03:09.023
increased the hippocampus ability to connect to other regions of the brain

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.817
so even though cortisol may impair some pathways,

00:03:11.825 --> 00:03:16.107
studying with practice tests creates new paths to route around blockages.

00:03:16.131 --> 00:03:17.210
Feeling distracted?

00:03:17.234 --> 00:03:18.694
Try a mini workout!

00:03:18.711 --> 00:03:21.354
Studies show that those who’ve worked out for 15 minutes

00:03:21.378 --> 00:03:23.179
and then complete a memory task

00:03:23.195 --> 00:03:27.266
complete tasks significantly faster than those that haven’t exercised.

00:03:27.283 --> 00:03:29.449
Even a simple walk can make a difference.

00:03:29.458 --> 00:03:31.505
But you also need to take a minute and think about

00:03:31.537 --> 00:03:34.124
the way that is you personally study best!

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:38.853
Meta-cognition is the analysis of one’s own learning or thinking processes.

00:03:38.861 --> 00:03:42.329
Studies have found that students who have poor meta-cognitive skills

00:03:42.353 --> 00:03:45.931
meaning they lack awareness of assessing their own strengths and weaknesses

00:03:45.948 --> 00:03:47.828
perform worse on tests.

00:03:47.853 --> 00:03:51.082
So look inward on ways you have been effective before

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:52.814
and implement those strategies.

00:03:52.838 --> 00:03:55.298
If you know that studying solo works best for you

00:03:55.306 --> 00:03:57.917
skip out on the cramming session with your classmates

00:03:57.942 --> 00:03:59.703
it is crunch time after all!

00:03:59.727 --> 00:04:03.284
There’s also one other really important distinction to make:

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:05.593
are you cramming late into the night because

00:04:05.617 --> 00:04:09.246
you know very very little about the topic for your upcoming exam?

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:13.381
Or are you hoping to perfect an already strong base of knowledge…

00:04:13.397 --> 00:04:15.064
If you’ve already studied

00:04:15.093 --> 00:04:16.688
GO TO SLEEP!

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:19.204
There is more than a century’s worth of research

00:04:19.212 --> 00:04:22.196
concluding that sleep is essential for memory retention.

00:04:22.212 --> 00:04:25.433
But if you really only can spare a few minutes to sleep

00:04:25.449 --> 00:04:27.028
consider rocking.

00:04:27.044 --> 00:04:27.528
That’s right,

00:04:27.553 --> 00:04:29.140
a recent study found that participants

00:04:29.148 --> 00:04:32.081
who slept on a bed engineered to gently rock

00:04:32.086 --> 00:04:33.990
were able to fall asleep more quickly,

00:04:34.006 --> 00:04:38.478
sleep more deeply, and perform better on memory tests the next morning

00:04:38.494 --> 00:04:40.740
so rockabye baby really works!

00:04:40.745 --> 00:04:44.334
Of course, if you want to avoid cramming next time and get ahead,

00:04:44.359 --> 00:04:46.452
