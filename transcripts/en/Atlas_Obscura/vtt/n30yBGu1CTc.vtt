00:00:00.376 --> 00:00:02.510
- The time on the bottom is critical.

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:03.570
It's our bread and butter so to speak

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:05.487
so we use every second.

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:11.006
The Alvin is the United States

00:00:11.006 --> 00:00:13.970
deepest diving manned submersible.

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:17.023
We're capable of going to 4500 meters.

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.910
At one time in the past, the
lunches were a bit varied.

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:27.110
There was a particular
lunch that caused some

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:30.663
gastronomical distress and
they had to abort the dive.

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:34.960
We do all these amazing
things but the people

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.530
that make the food onboard
the ship, they're heroes.

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:38.363
They really are.

00:00:38.363 --> 00:00:40.600
They put a lot of thought
into it and they keep people

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:41.863
really happy in port.

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:52.743
- Morning begins with the
making of the Alvin lunch.

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.870
We keep peanut butter and honey mixed up.

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:59.390
This is the favorite combination

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:01.150
and the one that pleases everybody.

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:03.730
Everybody's got a favorite jam but it,

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:06.230
it's not the same as the next guy.

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:08.390
You're not going down
there to dine in splendor.

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:10.130
You need fuel food.

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:11.412
This is what we will provide.

00:01:11.412 --> 00:01:13.785
Something real nutritious.

00:01:13.785 --> 00:01:15.693
We will provide wheat bread.

00:01:15.944 --> 00:01:18.414
It's the best, most wholesome choice.

00:01:18.422 --> 00:01:21.200
After which it goes in lunch.

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.733
We seal it up, place it in the bag.

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:27.360
Thermos of cold water.

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.723
Thermos of hot coffee.

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:34.533
- I love peanut butter honey.

00:01:34.533 --> 00:01:37.616
(upbeat happy music)

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:41.523
Pretty good.

00:01:41.523 --> 00:01:43.523
See how the honey gets all crystallized?

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:47.490
But clearly we have to ask whether people

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:48.990
are allergic to peanut butter.

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:52.490
That would be bad.

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:54.418
(laughter)

00:01:54.418 --> 00:01:56.918
(quiet music)

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.564
It would be impossible for
humans to visit the deep ocean

00:02:02.564 --> 00:02:04.983
without a machine like Alvin.

00:02:04.983 --> 00:02:05.816
If we don't stop for lunch,

00:02:05.816 --> 00:02:07.870
typically what will happen
is you get a breather

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:10.240
from the work, you reach
back, you grab your lunch.

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:12.050
You grab a sandwich and
you're looking out the window

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.393
flying the sub, take a bite
of your sandwich, stash it.

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.735
I've had close to 350
dives in the submarine

00:02:21.735 --> 00:02:24.410
all over the world's oceans

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.480
in various different places and depths.

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.683
And seen almost
indescribably amazing places.

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:37.830
I would wager that anybody who's eaten

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:39.950
a peanut butter honey sandwich in Alvin,

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:42.263
every time they eat one,
thinks about their dive.
