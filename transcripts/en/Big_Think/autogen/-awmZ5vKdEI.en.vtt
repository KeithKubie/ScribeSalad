to find common interests and if you can
 

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:43.459
to find common interests and if you can
find those common interests then you'll

00:01:43.459 --> 00:01:43.469
find those common interests then you'll
 

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:44.599
find those common interests then you'll
have a lot more respect for the
