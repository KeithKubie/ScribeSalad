need to be green.

Wait, what do you mean, you
can't have a functioning

DeLorean replica on stage?

SPEAKER: Paul, we
need those Tesla coils

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:11.150
for the after party.

on February 13 and 14,

00:00:21.479 --> 00:00:23.770
with two days chock-full of
talks by the AMP community,

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:26.400
and plenty of opportunities
to meet like-minded developers

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.150
and designers who care
about building best

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:30.820
in class, user-first websites.

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:33.310
Naturally, we come with tons
of news and announcements

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:35.360
related to AMP's
developer experience.

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:37.540
We've also got companies
like Reddit and Airbnb

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:39.910
talking about their technical
journeys, learnings,

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:41.800
and implementation details.

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.270
Plus, you'll learn
more about how

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:45.550
AMP is accelerating
the WordPress ecosystem

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:48.310
and influencing the
web platform at large.

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:50.890
AMP Conf is happening
in less than six weeks,

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:52.390
and I'd love to see you there.

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:54.310
Tickets don't cost
anything, and we'll still

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:55.360
have a bunch available.

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.890
So come apply for a
spot on ampproject.org.

00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:59.554
But if you can't
make it in person,

00:00:59.554 --> 00:01:00.970
subscribe to the
AMP channel to be

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:02.715
notified about the live stream.

00:01:02.715 --> 00:01:04.340
If you're a developer
or a designer who

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:06.460
is committed to beautiful
user experiences,

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.970

offer at AMP Conf 2018.

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:10.900
See you in Amsterdam.
