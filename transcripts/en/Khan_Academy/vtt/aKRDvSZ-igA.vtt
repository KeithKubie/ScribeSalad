00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:03.705
The second law of thermodynamics
tells us that

00:00:03.705 --> 00:00:06.580
the entropy of the universe
is always increasing.

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:10.610
So the change in entropy for
the universe, when it

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:13.030
undergoes any process,
is always greater

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:14.260
than or equal to 0.

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:17.210
And we showed in the previous
video that it has a lot of

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:18.460
implications.

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:23.070
Regardless of how you define
your entropy, whether you

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.520
define entropy as equal to
some constant times the

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:30.660
natural log of the number of
states your system could take

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.080
on, or whether you define change
in entropy to be equal

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:37.870
to the heat added to the
system divided by the

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:40.390
temperature at which it is
added, either of these

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:42.660
descriptions, combined with
our second law of

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.830
thermodynamics tell us things
like, when you have a hot body

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:52.890
next to a cold body-- so say
this is T1, and then I have T2

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.970
over here-- that heat will
flow from the hot

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:57.160
body to the cold body.

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:57.730
And we showed that

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:00.010
mathematically in the last video.

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:02.960
That heat will flow
in this direction.

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.170
Now, one of the commenters on
the last video said, hey,

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:07.260
could you cover Maxwell's
demon?

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.250
And I will.

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.900
Because it's an interesting
thought experiment that seems

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:16.540
to defy this principle.

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:19.420
It seems to defy the second
law of thermodynamics.

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:23.240
And it has a very tantalizing
name, Maxwell's demon.

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.300
Apparently, though, it was not
Maxwell who called it a demon.

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:28.260
It was Kelvin.

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:32.080
All these guys, you know, they
all meddle in everything.

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:37.160
So Maxwell's demon.

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.440
And this is the same Maxwell
famous for Maxwell's equation,

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.760
so he obviously dealt with
a lot of things.

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.680
He's actually also the first
person to ever generate a

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:46.590
color image.

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.430
So this is in the mid-1800s.

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:51.890
So all around a fairly
sharp individual.

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.290
But what's Maxwell's demon?

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:57.000
So when we say something has
a higher temperature than

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.440
something else, what
are we saying?

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:01.730
We're saying that its average
kinetic energy of its

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:05.500
molecules bumping around
here-- that the average

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.690
kinetic energy of the molecules
here-- is higher

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:12.440
than the average kinetic energy
of the molecules here.

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.550
Now notice, I said its average
kinetic energy.

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:17.240
And we've talked about
this multiple times.

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:19.020
Temperature is a macro state.

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.940
We know that at the micro level,
all of these molecules

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:23.130
have different velocities.

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.670
They're bumping into each other,
transferring momentum

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:26.630
to each other.

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:28.540
You know, this guy might
be going super

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.040
fast in that direction.

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.290
This guy might actually
be going quite slow.

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.360
This guy might be going
super fast like that.

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.080
That guy might be going
quite slow.

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:37.520
It's just a hodgepodge
of things.

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:39.130
You could actually draw
a distribution.

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:43.260
If you knew the micro states
of everything, you could

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:44.650
actually draw a little
histogram.

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:49.450
We could say, for T1--
let's say this is

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.850
on the Kelvin scale.

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:55.280
So you could say, look, my
average temperature is here,

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.050
but I have a whole distribution
of particles.

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:59.745
So let's say this is number
of particles.

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:04.580
And I won't put a scale there.

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:05.890
You'll get the idea.

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:08.220
So I have a bunch of particles
that are at T1, but I have

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.340
some particles that could be
really close to absolute 0.

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:11.860
I mean, it'd be very few, but.

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.710
And then you have a bunch that
are maybe at T1, and then you

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:19.120
have a bunch of particles that
could have actually kinetic

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:20.740
energy higher than T1.

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:22.710
Higher than the average
kinetic energy.

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:23.870
Maybe that's this one here.

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:26.450
Maybe the guy down here is
this guy with barely any

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:27.010
kinetic energy.

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:29.330
It means there's some guy
who's almost completely

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:31.290
stationary, who's, you
know, sitting right

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:32.740
around there someplace.

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:35.300
So there's a whole distribution
of particles.

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:41.230
Likewise, this T2 system right
here, on average, these

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:43.670
molecules have a lower
kinetic energy.

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:45.780
But you know, there might be one
particle here that has a

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.370
really high kinetic energy.

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:49.000
But most of them on
average are lower.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.500
So if I were to draw the
distribution of T2, my average

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.770
kinetic energy is lower, but
my distribution might look

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:58.640
something like this.

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:00.800
It can't go backwards
like that.

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:03.220
It might look something
like this.

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:06.100
Oh, I don't know, maybe it looks
something like that.

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:07.950
Let me try it a little
different.

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:09.500
I'll make it go just as high.

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:12.610
Maybe it looks something
like that.

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:13.690
right?

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:18.760
So notice, there are some
molecules in T1 that are below

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:20.970
the average kinetic
energy of T2.

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:21.269
Right?

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:22.480
There are these molecules
here.

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:26.680
These are these slow
guys right there.

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:30.210
And notice, there are some guys
in T2 that have a higher

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:33.490
kinetic energy than
the average in T1.

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:35.380
So these are these
guys right here.

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:43.480
And so the fast guys in T2--
so even though T2 is, quote

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:46.320
unquote, colder, it has lower
average kinetic energy,

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:50.980
there's some molecules, if you
look at the micro state, that

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:53.390
are actually moving around quite
rapidly, and there are

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:56.180
some molecules here that are
moving around quite slowly.

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:00.090
So what Maxwell said is, hey,
what if I had my-- and he

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:02.510
actually didn't use the word
demon, but we'll use the word

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:05.940
demon, because it makes it
seem very interesting and

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:08.820
metaphysical on some level, but
it really isn't-- what if

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:12.210
I had some dude, let's call him
the demon, with a little

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:13.630
trapdoor here?

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:14.880
Let me draw a little
bit neater.

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:22.380
So between those two
systems, let's say

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:24.120
that they're insulated.

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:27.480
Let's say that they're separated
from each other.

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:31.830
So this is T1 where I have a
bunch of particles, you know,

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:36.210
with their different
kinetic energies.

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:38.240
And then, here is T2.

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:40.470
And I'm making them separated,
and maybe they're connected

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:44.230
only by this little connection
right here.

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:45.320
T2.

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:49.200
These guys have a slower
kinetic energy.

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:52.350
And what Maxwell, his little
thought experiment was, hey,

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:56.690
let me say that I have some
dude in charge of a door--

00:05:56.690 --> 00:06:00.510
maybe the door is right
here-- and he has

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:02.050
control over this door.

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:05.350
And whenever a really fast
particle in T2, one of these

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:09.080
particles over here, come near
the door-- so let's say this

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:14.050
guy is flying-- let's say
that guy right there.

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:16.750
He's going super fast. He has
super high kinetic energy, and

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:19.360
he's just going perfectly
for the door.

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:20.940
So the demon says, hey.

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:21.920
I see that guy.

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:23.380
He's coming for the door.

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:27.800
He's going to lift his hatch,
and he's going to allow this

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:30.100
particle to get into T1.

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:35.200
So after he lifts the hatch,
that particle will just keep

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:36.990
going, and it'll be in T1.

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:40.490
And then he closes the hatch
again, because he just wants

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:43.730
the fast particles to
go from T2 to T1.

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:48.330
And then when he sees a little
slow, you know, pokey little

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:51.870
particle coming here, one of
these guys down here, he opens

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:54.510
the trapdoor again, and he
allows that one to go.

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:57.820
So then that guy shows
up in here.

00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:00.460
So if he just kept doing that,
what's it going to look like

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:01.410
at the end?

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:03.820
Well, at the end, you're going
to segregate-- and it could

00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:05.490
take a while.

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:10.660
But you're going to segregate
all the slow particles on--

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:11.380
let me draw it.

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:14.140
I'll make the boundary in brown,
because now it's not

00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:15.850
clear which one is-- well.

00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:16.920
We'll talk about it
a little bit.

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:18.350
So that's the boundary.

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:19.130
That's his door.

00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:20.100
What's going to happen
at the end?

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:22.010
All the fast particles-- some
of them are going to be the

00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:25.930
original fast particles
that are in T1, right?

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:29.620
There are some original fast
particles in T1 are going to

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:34.390
be still on the side
of the barrier.

00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:37.550
Let me draw-- make sure you
don't get these two confused.

00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:38.970
This is a separate picture.

00:07:38.970 --> 00:07:41.990
Now all of the fast particles
from T2 are also going to be

00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:42.520
stuck there.

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:45.020
Because eventually they're all
going to get close to that

00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:47.990
door, if you wait long enough.

00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:50.400
So then this guy's also going
to have a bunch of the, what

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:54.110
would originally, in the T2 side
of the barrier, they're

00:07:54.110 --> 00:07:55.120
also going to be there.

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:57.460
So you're going to have a
bunch of fast particles.

00:07:57.460 --> 00:08:01.410
Likewise, all the slow T2
particles are going to be

00:08:01.410 --> 00:08:04.150
remaining on the side
of the barrier.

00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:05.850
So these are the slow guys.

00:08:05.850 --> 00:08:09.290
And he would have let all the
slow T1-- I shouldn't even

00:08:09.290 --> 00:08:11.010
call them T1 anymore.

00:08:11.010 --> 00:08:12.630
I'll call them side 1.

00:08:12.630 --> 00:08:14.110
Side 1 particles here.

00:08:17.470 --> 00:08:19.940
Slow side 1 particles.

00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:23.130
So what just happened here?

00:08:23.130 --> 00:08:26.380
This was the hot body, this
was the cold body.

00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:29.430
The second law of thermodynamics
would have told

00:08:29.430 --> 00:08:31.690
us that heat would have gone
from here to here.

00:08:31.690 --> 00:08:34.000
That their temperatures
should have equalized

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:35.230
to a certain degree.

00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:38.520
So the hot bodies should get
colder, the cold bodies should

00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:39.190
get hotter.

00:08:39.190 --> 00:08:41.270
They should kind of average
out a little bit.

00:08:41.270 --> 00:08:45.550
But using this little demonic
figure, what did he do?

00:08:45.550 --> 00:08:47.780
He made the hot body
hotter, right?

00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:50.080
Now the average kinetic energy
here is even higher.

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:54.950
He transferred all of these high
kinetic energy particles

00:08:54.950 --> 00:08:57.730
to that distribution, so now
that distribution is going to

00:08:57.730 --> 00:09:01.170
look-- the way you could think
about it, if you transferred

00:09:01.170 --> 00:09:04.450
all of these guys to this guy
over here, the distribution

00:09:04.450 --> 00:09:07.150
will now look something like--
let me see if I can do it.

00:09:07.150 --> 00:09:10.860
It will look something
like that for T1,

00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:12.200
instead of the old one.

00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:16.510
And T2-- and he took all the
hot ones away, all the cold

00:09:16.510 --> 00:09:17.620
ones away, from T1.

00:09:17.620 --> 00:09:19.740
So these guys are going
to disappear.

00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:21.340
They're not going to
be there anymore.

00:09:21.340 --> 00:09:22.590
And he added them to T2.

00:09:25.545 --> 00:09:28.600
So the distribution of T2 is
going to look like that, and

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:32.270
he erased, of course,
these from T2.

00:09:32.270 --> 00:09:35.152
He took all of these
guys out of T2.

00:09:35.152 --> 00:09:36.880
Let me erase this right here.

00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:38.410
That was the old distribution
of T1.

00:09:38.410 --> 00:09:40.960
So the T2 distribution now looks
something like this.

00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:47.640
So T2, the new average might
be something like here.

00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:49.640
This is my new T2.

00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:52.590
And my new T1 is going to move
to the right a little bit.

00:09:52.590 --> 00:09:54.260
The average is going
to be higher.

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:57.450
So this demon seems to have
violated the second law of

00:09:57.450 --> 00:09:58.400
thermodynamics.

00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:00.540
Let me box off this
right here.

00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:04.810
My little diagrams
are overlapping.

00:10:04.810 --> 00:10:07.750
This example shows that the hot
got hotter and the cold

00:10:07.750 --> 00:10:08.400
got colder.

00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:10.950
So Maxwell's thought experiment
says, hey, we

00:10:10.950 --> 00:10:14.030
violated the second law
of thermodynamics.

00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:16.530
And this actually
was a conundrum

00:10:16.530 --> 00:10:17.280
for many, many years.

00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:20.450
Even in this century, people
kind of, hey, you know,

00:10:20.450 --> 00:10:22.340
there's something fudgy
about here,

00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:23.420
something not quite right.

00:10:23.420 --> 00:10:25.260
And the thing that's not quite
right, and I'm not going to

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:27.470
prove it to you mathematically,
is-- and it's

00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:31.270
kind of analogous to the
refrigerator example-- is, to

00:10:31.270 --> 00:10:37.750
have something here-- to have
some dude, perhaps he's a

00:10:37.750 --> 00:10:43.730
demon, here, pulling this
little door when it's

00:10:43.730 --> 00:10:47.000
convenient, when the fast
particles are going from this

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.690
side or the slow particles are
going from that side-- in

00:10:49.690 --> 00:10:52.270
order for him to do it
correctly, he's going to have

00:10:52.270 --> 00:10:53.870
to keep track of where all
the particles are.

00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:55.540
He'll need to keep track
of particles.

00:10:55.540 --> 00:10:58.860
I mean, these aren't balls,
like, you know, macro balls.

00:10:58.860 --> 00:11:03.640
These are micro molecules or
atoms. He's going to have to

00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:06.030
bounce light off of them, or
he's going to have to bounce

00:11:06.030 --> 00:11:08.200
electrons, use an electron
microscope.

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:10.290
He's going to have to keep
track of these gazillion

00:11:10.290 --> 00:11:11.950
particles that are there.

00:11:11.950 --> 00:11:13.480
And I mean, think about it.

00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:16.330
He might have to have a super
duper-- if it doesn't occur in

00:11:16.330 --> 00:11:18.940
his head, he might have to have
some kind of hardcore

00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:22.550
computer microchip that's
churning away.

00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:25.740
And this would be, actually,
for a computer to do this,

00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:28.160
this would be intensive
computation power.

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:30.580
And let your computer run for
a little bit and feel the

00:11:30.580 --> 00:11:35.540
microchip-- this is generating
a lot of heat.

00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:41.110
His bouncing off light, or
whatever he's trying to bounce

00:11:41.110 --> 00:11:44.760
off of the different molecules
to be able to measure how fast

00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:47.520
they're going, that's also
going to generate heat.

00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:49.120
He's going to have to
do work to do that.

00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:50.690
He's going to have to
measure everything.

00:11:50.690 --> 00:11:52.880
There's a lot of stuff that's
going on that he's going to

00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:53.800
have to do.

00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:56.520
So the current answer is-- and
it's not easy to prove

00:11:56.520 --> 00:11:58.830
mathematically-- but the current
answer is, if you

00:11:58.830 --> 00:12:01.660
actually wanted to build a demon
like this-- and probably

00:12:01.660 --> 00:12:04.760
in our world today, you'd use
some type of computer with

00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:07.760
some type of sensors-- to
attempt to do this-- and there

00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:12.860
are people who have attempted
to do this, on some level.

00:12:12.860 --> 00:12:16.220
This computer and this whole
system is going to generate

00:12:16.220 --> 00:12:21.340
more entropy-- so the delta S
here is going to generate more

00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:27.790
entropy than the entropy that's
lost by making the cold

00:12:27.790 --> 00:12:30.160
side colder and the
hot side hotter.

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:31.960
So Maxwell's demon,
and I didn't do

00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:32.900
anything rigorous here.

00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:34.210
I didn't prove it to you.

00:12:34.210 --> 00:12:36.080
But Maxwell's demon, it's
an interesting thought

00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:37.450
experiment, because it gives
you a little bit more

00:12:37.450 --> 00:12:38.710
intuition about the difference
between macro

00:12:38.710 --> 00:12:40.440
states and micro states.

00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:43.630
And what happens at the
molecular level in terms of

00:12:43.630 --> 00:12:45.970
temperature, and how you can
make a cold body colder and a

00:12:45.970 --> 00:12:47.330
hot body hotter.

00:12:47.330 --> 00:12:49.920
But answer is, it really
isn't a paradox or

00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:51.860
anything like that.

00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:54.960
When you think about the entropy
of the entire system,

00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:57.510
you have to include
the demon himself.

00:12:57.510 --> 00:13:00.680
And if you include the demon
himself, he's generating more

00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:04.685
entropy every time he opens that
door-- and maybe there's

00:13:04.685 --> 00:13:06.750
some energy required to
open the door itself.

00:13:06.750 --> 00:13:10.360
But he generates more entropy
when he does all of this than

00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:14.700
the entropy that might be lost,
when say, for example,

00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:17.130
one of these slowpoke particles
kind of just

00:13:17.130 --> 00:13:20.280
traverses onto that side
of the barrier.

00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:22.350
Anyway, I thought I would just
expose you to that, because

00:13:22.350 --> 00:13:25.130
it's a really neat thought
experiment.

00:13:25.130 --> 00:13:27.270
So I'll see in the next video.
