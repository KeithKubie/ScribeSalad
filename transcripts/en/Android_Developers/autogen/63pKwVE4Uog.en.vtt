00:00:00.409 --> 00:00:02.200
 We bring you again 

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:04.740
 Android next developer preview version 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.530
 You can experiment with your application and discover new features. 

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:09.480
 Give feedback to our team 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.060
 Hello everyone, I am Nasir Khan. I am the advocate of Android developers. 

00:00:13.154 --> 00:00:15.330
 Android O has more control over the background's response 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.180
 This is by increasing the use of RAM 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.210
 Thereby improving interactive performance 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.330
 Android Nougat prevents apps from receiving 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.640
 Three special hidden broadcasts 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.650
 Such as a new photo broadcast from an explicit receiver 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:33.740
 Apps for O will no longer accept 

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:36.311
 Most implicit receivers of explicit receivers 

00:00:36.311 --> 00:00:38.560
 Only a few exceptions are allowed 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:41.490
 Such as BOOT_COMPLETED, LOCALE_CHANGED, etc. 

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:44.822
 Clear broadcast for application packages 

00:00:44.822 --> 00:00:46.530
 Is registered in the description 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.190
 Like ACTION_MY_PACKAGE_REPLACED. 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.460
 When you start it, you register and 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.980
 Received implicit broadcast 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.730
 Background service for the application of Android O 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.090
 Will only run for a short time, then there will be no 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.380
 Visible activity or front screen service 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.430
 Open the service, or the service is pending 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.260
 Will throw an IllegalStateException 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.570
 When the response is not in the background 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.080
 Front screen services that require ongoing notifications 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.700
 Kept working 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.310
 There is a new API to start the front screen service directly 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.070
 startServiceInForeground. 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.040
 Finally, even if your response is not for O 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:28.860
 There will be several changes 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.450
 First, when your app enters the cache phase 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:33.980
 That is to say, Android components that are not started 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:37.260
 Any unlock will be sent automatically 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.110
 Second, the location update will also change. 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.410
 Apps that require background location updates 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:47.150
 Just a few limited updates per hour 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:48.810
 Front screen service is not affected 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.460
 So, navigation or record movement 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:53.160
 As they perform their location-dependent tasks 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:56.520
 Can be updated very quickly 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.310
 If another app is in front screen navigation 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.830
 Then your background app can be used with the front screen app 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:06.000
 Get the location update at the same frequency 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.530
 We constantly improve the privacy of our users 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:10.880
 So even if you don't target O 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.030
 You will also notice changes in the Android ID in Settings.Secure 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:19.220
 Inside O, it will return a different ID for different applications. 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:22.690
 In other words, it now sets the scope of each application for each user. 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.080
 This new feature will continue to be reinstalled when the app is reinstalled. 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.940
 But for a simple, standard system to help the application profit 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:32.170
 User reset 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.610
 And replaced by the ID of the playback service provided by Google. 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:37.600
 Also, considering privacy, applications for O 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:42.890
 Cannot use the GET_ACCOUNTS license to get the user's account 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:47.930
 Instead, the app must rely on account selection activities. 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:49.260
 Account owner 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.860
 Ability to choose whether the account is visible to other apps 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:55.150
 Moreover, the account selection activity will be updated randomly. 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.160
 Android O added a notification channel 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.380
 Fine-grained control to give you more notifications 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:03.090
 And let the app developer 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.840
 More flexible delivery of different types of notifications 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.700
 Rarely blocked 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:10.650
 a notification channel 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.000
 Is a notification that has been categorized from a single app. 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.160
 Users can block a single category 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.340
 Or change its actions, such as changing the button, increasing 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:23.100
 Vibration and brightness, changing the privacy of the lock screen 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:26.330
 You can use the channel to have different types of notifications 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:29.840
 For example, a chat app will show two different conversations. 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.690
 End users may apply different settings 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:35.472
 a long button on the notification 

00:03:35.472 --> 00:03:37.200
 [?å¸¦?] to channel settings 

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:40.220
 All applications that target O must implement the channel 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:42.440
 Otherwise, the notice will not appear 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:43.460
 It is easy to do 

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:45.560
 Just create a channel 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:48.290
 Then call the channel in the notification creation 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:50.240
 There are many features in user notifications 

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:53.280
 For example, the ability to notify during the time, set the timeout to cancel 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.790
 The background color of the notification 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:58.240
 Be sure to check for more details 

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:00.820
 Filling in the form is a time consuming 

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:01.660
 And error-prone tasks 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:04.480
 New auto-filling framework makes application easier 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:07.040
 Help their users do this 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:10.060
 Android O allows users to choose auto-filled apps 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:13.130
 Similar to how to choose a keyboard application 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:16.160
 Autofill application is responsible for storing and protecting user data 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:19.870
 , for example, address, credit card number 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:22.430
 User name, even password, etc. 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:24.380
 There is also a new visual API 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:26.180
 You need to implement it in your custom vision 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:28.220
 To guarantee metadata 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:29.970
 Displayed in an auto-filled frame 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:32.370
 The pictures in the picture are now available for all devices. 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:34.160
 Not just for Android TV 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.010
 And an application has to do just 

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:39.830
 Invoke input drawing in the back or stop drawing mode method 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:42.650
 The system supports inputting pictures in the picture. 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:44.210
 Like multiple video events 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:46.890
 Entered the pattern of still pictures in the picture 

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:49.210
 If you have a social app, be sure to make sure 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:52.590
 The playback can continue in the stopped state. 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:55.290
 SetPictureinPictureArgs allows activities 

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:57.080
 Specify the size of the image within the image, scale 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:59.146
 And remote custom action 

00:04:59.146 --> 00:05:03.260
 This action allows the user to interact directly in the image activity within the image 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:07.170
 Instead of making the app explicitly use the API demo 

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:11.770
 Regular events can now be launched on secondary displays 

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:14.580
 These impressions have basic settings in units of impressions 

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:15.802
 And resource management 

00:05:15.802 --> 00:05:17.760
 This means some parts of this setup 

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:22.110
 Such as the width of the screen DP, height DP, and density DP 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:26.620
 Will show according to the current activity 

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:30.370
 Fonts are now a fully supported resource type in Android 

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:35.140
 You can use the method of getting the font and get the font by its ID. 

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:37.870
 You can also qualify the entire font family in XML. 

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:40.180
 Choose font style and size 

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:42.130
 Resources based on fonts 

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:44.534
 There are more in the developer preview 

00:05:44.534 --> 00:05:46.450
 Please check the preview page 

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:49.159
 Meet more about O and preview projects 

00:05:49.159 --> 00:05:50.950
 View Android's developer channel 

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:52.830
 To watch more of these videos 

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:53.630
 Thank you everyone 

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:56.680
