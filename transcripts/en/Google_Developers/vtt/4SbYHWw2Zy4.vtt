00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:04.710
Hi.

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:05.751
My name's Johann du Toit.

00:00:05.751 --> 00:00:07.660
I am the co-founder
of Get Me Known,

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:10.460
which is a national microchip
database featuring everything

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:13.180
from dogs to
horses, and where we

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:17.500
look at patterns on that data
to then better understand

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:21.300
how these records are spread
out across the country.

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.090
Today, I'm going to be talking
about how we use BigQuery

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.300
to get insights from data that's
constantly being streamed in

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.689
from across the country on
records from pigs to farmers.

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:35.990
So Get Me Known was founded
about three years ago.

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:38.830
Coming from a family that's
passionate about animals,

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:42.300
we were registering when we had
to fill in [? free ?] forms.

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.390
So we decided that's
not how we want it,

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.910
and we built a company where
you can go to websites,

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.340
fill in all your details.

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:52.620
And it assigns a certain
number to your information.

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.660
So if a pig gets lost,
stolen, is found somewhere,

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.570
you've got a record
that links it to you,

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:03.920
and they can contact you and
get your little guy home.

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.730
So users use the service by
actually going to the websites,

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:09.710
signing up, filling in the data.

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:12.530
That data is then stored
in the back end which

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:14.870
we stream to BigQuery,
where we look

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:18.400
at data to get some insights.

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:22.350
So I see this being used in
almost every organization.

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.200
And this day and
age, we've got data

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.040
coming in from every
side, every angle.

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:28.640
And every piece of
your business is

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.375
going to be using some
metric, which you can look at.

00:01:31.375 --> 00:01:33.840
And BigQuery is
essentially where

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.700
we're aggregating all this
and looking for patterns.

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:42.450
So what sales are doing good,
what records are not coming in,

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.660
where are you actually getting
data from, and just looking

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:47.820
for patterns to
grow your business.

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.270
So we use BigQuery
to essentially

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.480
look at all our sales data,
where we look for patterns,

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.839
where they're coming
from, and how much.

00:01:56.839 --> 00:01:58.630
We tend to lay this
out in a nice heat map,

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:00.980
so you can actually,
by one glance,

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:02.915
see where your
business is taking off

00:02:02.915 --> 00:02:06.175
and where you need to put
more pressure on to push sales

00:02:06.175 --> 00:02:08.190
in a certain region.

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.600
So Get Me Known in itself is
just a website where anyone can

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.660
go to to get data about a
microchip on a dog, or a cat,

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:20.070
or a horse that they found and
get the contact information

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:21.710
to speak to the breeders.

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:24.630
We also partner with all
the local databases that

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:25.870
are also running.

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.380
So you can get information
if we might not have it.

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:32.120
So the idea is you'd log in.

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:39.210
And here's your account that
you have set up with us.

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:41.870
And you'd have a
list of microchips.

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.780
So these are all
registered to your name.

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:48.210
And they pipe their
data into a back end,

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:51.760
where we keep a big log of
all the changes happening

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.770
on all of these records.

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:56.020
So we can actually
go back and look

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:00.330
at when the chip was registered,
when the name was changed,

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.240
when an owner
might have changed,

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:05.090
how long the owner
has been the owner,

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:07.510
and print the certificate.

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:12.520
So that would be the fountain
to what we call the back end

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:14.480
service, which we actually use.

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.130
And that pipes into
this big record

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:19.210
set where we keep
all this information

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:20.930
and look for patterns.

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:26.750
So using BigQuery, we've got
a schema of all these records

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:29.970
where we can actually go run
popular queries on this thing.

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:34.520
So we might want to look at
breed, color, and popularity.

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:39.960
So if we're on that, you'll
see this here Rottweiler

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:46.690
and black and tan combined
with the most popular.

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:51.040
And then if you go a step back
and look at maybe flag records.

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.850
Flag records are
records that you

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:57.015
give an extra piece of
information about [INAUDIBLE],

00:03:57.015 --> 00:03:59.250
so who to contact
if the pet is found.

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:04.010
So these will essentially be
stolen cattle, dogs, cats.

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:07.910
And we can actually go look
at where they were stolen,

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:11.200
what city, when.

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.970
So using this information
in the back end,

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:16.750
we can then look at hotspots.

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:21.430
So we know which areas of
say, Johannesburg and Pretoria

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:24.390
are known for getting
pets lost or stolen.

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:26.270
And we've got a
certain error rate.

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:31.120
But when that hits, we call
and notify external services

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:36.342
about these locations and give
them the top 10 records that

00:04:36.342 --> 00:04:37.800
actually just tell
them something's

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:39.170
going on then to have a look.

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:46.880
And we do this nation-wide.

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:50.120
This data I got by looking
at our main record set

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:53.840
and pulling out a limited
amount from BigQuery,

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:57.060
and then just rendering
it using Google Maps.

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:00.580
So this is a smaller
data set that I took just

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:02.680
to show you
distribution and how we

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:05.440
use BigQuery to pull this out.

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:08.705
And we'd internally any maybe
look at only South Africa

00:05:08.705 --> 00:05:11.060
and pull out details
from South Africa

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:12.770
and look at certain cities.

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:16.215
So say we want to look
at anything in Cape Town,

00:05:16.215 --> 00:05:18.740
or Johannesburg, or Pretoria.

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:23.330
Using this and small little
utilities that we write,

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:26.640
we can map out our data and
see where our customer base is,

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:31.160
and where we need to look at
to help ease local problems.

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:31.670
Thanks.

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:34.320
And that's how we use
BigQuery and the insights

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:38.070
we get from it to
get pets home safe.
